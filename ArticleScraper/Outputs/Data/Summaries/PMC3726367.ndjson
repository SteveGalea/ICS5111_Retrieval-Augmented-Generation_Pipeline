{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) has a biased nucleotide composition different from human genes. this raises the question of how evolution has chosen the nucleotide sequence of HIV-1 that is observed today. we applied the previously described synthetic attenuated virus engineering (SAVE) approach to HIV-1. the bias of A-rich codons in HIV-1 is thought to be the action of host enzymes of the APOBEC3 family. it has been shown that HIV-1 has adapted to rely on A-rich RNA sequences to support the synthesis of viral cDNA during reverse transcription. the amino acid pair Ala-Glu is expected to be encoded by GCCGAA and GCAGAG approximately equally as often as often. however, the codon pair GCCGAA is strongly underrepresented and is only one-seventh as often as GCAGAG. recoded poliovirus and influenza virus genomes so that they include infrequently used codon pairs. redesigned gag and protease fragments were recombined with HIV-1 infectious clones that lacked gag or protease. virus was recoded to use codon pairs that are underrepresented or overrepresented relative to the human genome. HIV-Pmin has a codon pair\u2013bias score much lower than human genes. the percentage of As in the HIV-Pmin sequence decreased from 0.36 to 0.30, and the percentage of Gs increased from 0.23 to 0.27. the percentage of As in the HIV-Pmax sequence slightly increased to 0.38 and the percentage of Gs, 0.22, was almost identical to that of the wild-type sequence. production of the HIV-1 antigen p24 in culture supernatants was determined on days 0\u20135 (MT-4 cells) and on days 2\u20137 (PBMCs) the slope of the plot provides an estimate of the viral replication capacity. comparisons between wild-type (HXB2) and mutant recoded viruses are shown. replication capacity highly reduced in PBMCs (p 0.001) and MT-4 cells (p 0.05) all constructs except HIV-PminA had a similar infectivity/p24 antigen ratio compared to HIV-Pwt. the reduction in p24 expression was not accompanied by a reduction in the production of gag RNA. real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of HIV-1 gag (p24) and GFP gene RNAs after one cycle of viral replication. the number of underrepresented pair codons present in HIV-Gmin (Figure 1) was reduced. only the constructs HIV-GminA, HIV-GminB, HIV-GminC, and HIV-GminD, which contain 118, 97, 93, and 34 synonymous substitutions, produced viable viruses. 05 308 HIV-GminABD 0.242 249 HIV-GminACD 0.235 245 HIV-GminBCD 0.225 224 HIV-Gmin 0.348 342 Figure 4 Replication kinetic assay of HIV-1 recoded variants. the slope of the plot provides an estimate of the viral replication capacity. ase coding regions significantly modified HIV-1 replication capacity in MT-4 cells and PBMCs. stability of attenuated phenotypes We tested the phenotypic stability of the recoded virus variant HIV-PminA. the significance of the difference between slopes was calculated with GraphPrism v. 4 software (unpaired t-test) values represent the mean SD from at least three independent experiments. no significant reversions were observed in the optimized HIV-Pmax. the HIV-GminA construct incorporated as majority variants the nonsynonymous mutations R4G, P48T and K114R in both passage replicates, indicating that these mutations were adaptive. most of the nonsynonymous substitutions occurred in codons carrying deoptimized synonymous mutations. the virus was recoded to use codon pairs that are underrepresented or overrepresented relative to the human genome by means of a previously described algorithm. only synonymous substitutions were introduced. no substitutions were introduced in the recombination regions. we first designed and constructed an entire deoptimized protease gene, HIV-Pmin, as well as an optimized protease gene, HIV-Pmax. of the 297 nucleotides that encode the HIV-1 protease, HIV-Pmin contains 57 and 38 synonymous substitutions. wild-type sequences depicted in black, deoptimized sequences in white, and optimized sequences in grey. chimeric, partly synthetic, recoded HIV-1 protease recoded synthetic constructs. growth competition experiments in MT-4 cells between the former variants and the wild-type virus confirmed that these deoptimized protease viruses had a replication capacity similar to that of the wild-type virus. in contrast, HIV-PminA, with only 15 synonymous substitutions, produced a virus that had its replication capacity highly reduced in PBMCs and MT-4 cells (p 0.05) single-cycle infectivity assay of HIV-1 protease codon pair\u2013recoded synthetic constructs were introduced into the GFP reporter HIV-1 infectious clone pNL4-3-deltaE-EGFP. the replication capacities of the different protease constructs are represented as a percentage relative to the wild-type HIV-1 HXB2 strain (100%). three hundred and eight synonymous substitutions were introduced in the 1 503 nucleotides of gag. no substitutions were introduced in the gag-pol ribosomal slip site or in the p6 portion of gag. the number of underrepresented pair codons present in HIV-Gmin was reduced. the slope of the plot provides an estimate of the viral replication capacity. the slope of the plot provides an estimate of the viral replication capacity. for each virus, the slope of the plot provides an estimate of the viral replication capacity. the IC50 of all viable gag and protease recoded variants to two NRTIs, AZT and TNF, and four protease inhibitors, NFV, DRV, ATV and ATV was calculated. no differences in drug susceptibility were found between wild-type virus and low or high fitness gag or protease recoded variants. deoptimized HIV-1 variants were able to recover fitness in tissue culture. kinetic assay of recoded variants after 15 serial passages in MT-4 cells. 10 (8%), 15 (15%), 7 (8%) and 2 (6%) mutations reverted to wild-type on initially mutated positions in HIV-GminA, HIV-GminB, HIV-GminC and HIV-GminD. most of these additional mutations alleviate negative codon pair\u2013bias scores. most of these additional mutations alleviate negative codon pair\u2013bias

Discussion Prior work has documented the effectiveness of making changes to the codon-pair bias of viral genomes in order to generate attenuated poliovirus and influenza virus. no data were available regarding whether this approach would work with lentiviruses, which, in contrast to poliovirus and influenza virus, integrate into the host cell genome. synonymous codon pair reengineering is an effective tool to phenotypically affect the replicative properties of HIV-1. a high level of preferred human codon use runs the risk of disrupting some unknown property of the HIV-1 RNA that is deleterious for other reasons. sequence clonal analysis of phenotype reversion shows no genetic or phenotypic reversion is observed in a codon pair base optimized viral population after the same number of passages in MT-4 cells. differences in virus protein or genome mutational robustness and evolutionary capacity can not be discarded. uation come from studies of evolution of resistance to antiretroviral drugs. future work should include immunization of animal models with different codon pair\u2013deoptimized attenuated HIV-1 strains. recoded viruses are also attenuated in vivo and to determine long-term stability. synthetic HIV-1 protease was generated by combining three overlapping synthetic DNA oligonucleotides. PCRs were purified with the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced to confirm the desired sequence. cell culture supernatants were harvested on days 3, 5 and 7 after transfection. the concentration of HIV-1 p24 antigen (Genscreen HIV-1 Ag assay, Bio-Rad) surpassed 500 ng/ml. five blind passages without p24 antigen detection in the cultured supernatant were performed. every 24 h, 200 l of supernatant was removed for p24 antigen quantification. growth kinetics were analyzed by fitting a linear model to the log-transformed p24 data during exponential growth phase. protease sequences were PCR amplified with oligonuclotides Apa1988 and Sbf2838. pNL4-3-deltaE-EGFP plasmids were digested with Apa I and Sbf I. p24 antigen produced 72 h after transfection was measured by flow cytometry. real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis of gag (p24) was carried out with oligonucleotides gag (p24) Fw (5\u2032-AAGGCCAGGGAATTTTCTTC 3\u2032) and gag (p24) Rv (5\u2032-TATTGTGACGAGGGGTCGTT 3\u2032) and the probe FAM (5\u2032-ACTGGCAGAAAACAGGGA-3\u2032) TAMRA. one-tenth of the culture, including cells and supernatant, was transferred to 1 106 fresh MT-4 cells. virus production was monitored by measuring p24 antigen. RNA was cloned into pGEM-T Easy Vector System I. the 293 T cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. PBMCs purified by ficoll density gradient were stimulated with phytohemagglutinin (PHA) and interleukin-2 (IL2) and maintained in RPMI medium supplemented with 20% FBS. negative codon pair score indicates the pair is statistically under-represented in the human genome. the codon pair bias for an entire open reading frame can then be calculated as the arithmetic mean of the individual codon pair scores. replication capacity assays Viral replication kinetics were performed by infecting either 1 106 MT-4 cells with 200 TCID50 (MOI of 0.0002) or 2 106 PBMCs (mixed from four healthy donors), stimulated 3 days previously with 5 g/ml PHA (Sigma-Aldrich) and 10 U/ml IL2 with 2000 TCID50 of each viral stock (MOI 0.001). every 24 h, 200 l of super 100 l of supernatant was used to infect fresh cells. RNA was extracted and amplified by one-step RT-PCR with oligonucleotides 5\u2032prot 2 and 3\u2032prot 2. Ratios were estimated on days 0, 7, 14, and 21. real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis was used to quantify HIV-1 gag RNA. a total of 8 105 293 T cells were transfected with 4 g of recombinant pNL4-3-deltaE-EGFP plasmid. s were obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. viral RNA from 140 l of culture supernatant was purified with the QIAGEN.
