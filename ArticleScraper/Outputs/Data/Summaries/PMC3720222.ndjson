{"summary": "the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) of the BaMV RNA genome was mapped structurally into ABC (a cloverleaf-like), D (a stem-loop) and E (pseudoknot) domains. the baMV replicase complex that was isolated from the infected plants was able to recognize the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis in vitro. the bamboo mosaic virus (BaMV) has a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome that is 6366 nt in length. two major subgenomic RNAs 2 and 1 kb in length share a 3\u2032 co-terminus with genomic RNA. the open reading frames 1 to 5 encode polypeptides 155, 28, 13, 6, and 25 kDa in size. the cis-acting elements in the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV RNA for minus-strand RNA synthesis were identified in an in vitro replication assay. the replicase complex was derived from BaMV-infected Nicotiana benthamiana[12,13] and in electrophoretic mobility shift and footprinting assays. the tertiary structure [14,15] and the potexviral conserved hexamer motif [16] in the 3 the 3\u2032 UTR of the Potato virus X (PVX) RNA was predicted to form 3 stem-loops (Figure 1) [20] and may be recognized by the replication machinery to initiate minus-strand RNA synthesis. the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV combined with PVX replicase produced approximately 63% template activity compared with that of the BaMV 3\u2032 UTR. activity were observed in non-potexviral RNA, such as the 3\u2032 TLS of the Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), with both viral replicases. mutants were created by replacing the domains in the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV RNA with the corresponding sequence from the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA. the chimeric RNAs were used to test the viral viability in protoplasts and plants as well as the template activity in an in vitro replication assay. insertion mutants BaMV-S/PABCDE, -/ABCP, -/ABCDP, -/PDE, -/PE, or -/ABCPE (all the replacement mutants) similar results were observed in plants for all the replacement mutants that were inoculated with the same set of full-length RNA transcripts. the blot was probed with a 32P-labelled RNA complementary to a 600-bp area at the 3\u2032-end of genomic RNA. the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) shown under the blot served as the sample loading control. the chimeras do not affect the translation and stability because the viral products of most of the chimeras were undetectable in protoplasts. all the mutant constructs can be used as the templates in the in vitro RdRp assay. the rABCDE transcript contained the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV RNA and 40 additional adenylate residues at the 3\u2032 end. the rPABCDE construct with PVX 3\u2032 UTR located upstream of the rABCDE displayed 110% RNA accumulation. 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA could functionally complement the D and E domains of BaMV RNA in vitro. however, only 51% and 38% RNA accumulation were achieved for rABCDP and rABCPE. no viral products were detected using Western and Northern blotting analyses. the suboptimal kinetics did not allow BaMV-S/ABCP to pass over the RNA threshold and effectively initiate the virus life cycle in the host cell. therefore, the kinetic parameters between the replicase complex and several mutant RNA templates were analyzed. the concentrations of each template used were ranged from 30 to 1500 nM. all data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. bApparent KM stands for how effectively an enzyme would bind the substrate. insertion mutants BaMV-S/PABCDE, -/ABCP, -/ABCDP, -/PDE, -/PE, or -/ABCPE (all the replacement mutants) similar results were observed in plants for all the replacement mutants that were inoculated with the same set of full-length RNA transcripts. the blot was probed with a 32P-labelled RNA complementary to a 600-bp area at the 3\u2032-end of genomic RNA. the ribosomal RNA (rRNA) shown under the blot served as the sample loading control. the chimeras do not affect the translation and stability because the viral products of most of the chimeras were undetectable in protoplasts. mutants were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and analyzed by a phosphorimager (Fujifilm BAS 2500) all the chimeras can be used as the templates in the in vitro RdRp assay. the rABCDE transcript, which contained the 3\u2032 UTR of BaMV RNA, was used as the positive control. the 3\u2032 UTR of PVX RNA could functionally complement the D and E domains of BaMV RNA in vitro. however, only 51% and 38% RNA accumulation were achieved for rABCDP and rABCPE. no viral products were detected using Western and Northern blotting analyses. the suboptimal kinetics did not allow BaMV-S/ABCP to pass over the RNA threshold and effectively initiate the virus life cycle in the host cell. therefore, the kinetic parameters between the replicase complex and several mutant RNA templates were analyzed. the concentrations of each template used were ranged from 30 to 1500 nM. all data represent the mean of at least three independent experiments. dVmax/KM stands for the overall specificity of the enzyme reaction. the rABCP transcript exhibited a wild-type level of RNA synthesis in the in vitro replication assay. the rABCP transcript exhibited a wild-type level of RNA synthesis in the in vitro replication assay. minus-strand RNA synthesis may be normally executed in vivo as that shown in the in vitro replication assay. the reduction of RNA replication with rABCDP (51%) and rABCPE (38%) in an in vitro BaMV RNA replication assay may be attributed to the redundant potexviral-conserved hexamer motifs. the difference between domains D and E is critical for the interaction between the RNA template and the RdRp complex. impede the movement of the enzyme complex on the RNA template. impede the movement of the enzyme complex on the RNA template. this may lead to an RNA replication rate too slow to overcome the threshold required to establish a successful infection. each of the 181- to 115-bp PCR fragments was used as the megaprimers together with an upstream primer, BaMV6122
