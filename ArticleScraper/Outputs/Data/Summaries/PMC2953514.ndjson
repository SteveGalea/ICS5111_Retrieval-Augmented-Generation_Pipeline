{"summary": "if information sources influence health protective behaviours during influenza pandemics or emerging infectious disease epidemics is uncertain. trust in formal (government/media) information was associated with greater reported understanding of A/H1N1 cause ( = 0.36) and A/H1N1 prevention self-efficacy ( = 0.25), which in turn were associated with more hand hygiene ( = 0.19 and = 0.23, respectively). trust in informal (interpersonal) information was negatively associated with perceived personal A/H1N1 suscept government health education messages are a major source of information for promoting self-protective practices against RIDs. these preventive messages emphasize improved hygiene, face-mask use by infected persons, and social distancing measures. to effectively predict behaviour during future epidemics robust theory is critical. we tested this model against data collected in the early phase of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic. a hypothesized model for health protection against pandemic influenza A/H1N1 was obtained from the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong/Hospital Authority Hong Kong cluster. a commercial polling organization administered the questionnaire using this telephone-survey methodology, targeting 1,000\u20131,500 participants on each occasion. the survey with the largest sample was selected for this analysis. one cantonese-speaking adult who lives >4 nights per week in each household was selected using a Kish grid. social factors in infectious diseases differ significantly from those in non-communicable diseases and warrant greater consideration than existing HBC models allow. health protective behaviour during the early stages of a novel epidemic would be more likely to resemble situational reactions using established or known default actions. trustworthiness influences decisions to utilize any given information source [30] to inform awareness of the situation. more trustworthy sources are likely to be more influential. observers are also subject to social conformity influences that can help adoption of group patterns of behaviour. responses were made on categorical five-point scales ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\" scaleability of these three items was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, which at 0.61 indicated the internal consistency between items was low, but acceptable. each was assessed using responses on 5-point scales of agreement with these two single item statements. one assessing absolute susceptibility and another assessing relative susceptibility formed a latent variable for perceived personal susceptibility. responses were 5-point scales of worry ranged from \u201cnever thought about it\u201d to \u201cextremely worried\u201d. model proposes trust in formal (government and media sources) and informal (from other people) information affects RID epidemic health protective behaviours, the latter by informing about generic risk and response characteristics for dealing with a potential threat (causes and protective responses), the latter about threat imminence, severity and response effectiveness (seeing how others behave). trust in formal information, trust in informal information, perceived personal susceptibility, hand washing and social distancing behaviours were entered as latent variables. other constructs were entered as observable (directly measured) variables because they were assessed with only one item. the proportion of missing data ranged from 0.1% for \"in the past one week, have you ever worried about catching influenza A/H1N1\" to 10.1% for \"did you wash hands after sneezing, coughing or touching nose in the past 3 days\" the age cut-off of 45 years was adopted to account for the introduction in Hong Kong of 6-year compulsory education in 1971 and 9-year compulsory education in 1978. 9% of male compared to 80% of female respondents, obtained at least secondary education (2 = 17.05, p0.001). we used a multi-group SEM to assess the invariance of the model (Figure 1) across gender and age group (respondents aged 18\u201344 and 45 or above), but the sample size for males aged 18\u201344 was relative small (Table S2). a p-value>0.05 for the \u201cDIFFTEST\u201d indicate a non-significant difference between the models. we performed a post-hoc examination of the model variable means for different gender and age groups and tested differences using the Mann-Whitney test. a commercial polling organization administered the questionnaire using this telephone-survey methodology, targeting 1,000\u20131,500 participants on each occasion. a sample size was calculated to give an estimate of A/H1N1 health protective behaviours with a precision of 3%. the survey with the largest sample was selected for this analysis. social factors in communicable respiratory diseases differ significantly from those in non-communicable diseases and warrant greater consideration than existing HBC models allow. health protective behaviour during the early stages of a novel epidemic would be more likely to resemble situational reactions using established or known default actions such as avoiding crowds. more trustworthy sources are likely to be more influential. observers are subject to social conformity influences that can help adoption of group patterns of behaviour. perceived risk is an important determinant of protective behavioural responses. responses were made on categorical five-point scales ranging from \"strongly disagree\" to \"strongly agree\" scaleability of these three items was assessed using Cronbach's alpha, which at 0.61 indicated the internal consistency between items was low, but acceptable. each was assessed using responses on 5-point scales of agreement with these two single item statements. one assessing absolute susceptibility and another assessing relative susceptibility formed a latent variable for perceived personal susceptibility. the Cronbach alpha of these two items was 0.66. Statistical analysis We first compared the demographic structure of the sample against that of the general population derived from the Hong Kong government General Household Survey. our model proposes that trust in formal (government and media sources) and informal (from other people) information affects RID epidemic health protective behaviours, the latter by informing about generic risk and response characteristics. trust in formal information, trust in informal information, perceived personal susceptibility, hand washing and social distancing behaviours were entered as latent (inferred) variables. other constructs were entered as observable (directly measured) variables because they were assessed with only one item. the analysis was conducted in Mplus 6.0 for Windows [43]. the proportion of missing data ranged from 0.1% for \"in the past one week, have you ever worried about catching influenza A/H1N1\" to 10.1% for \"did you wash hands after sneezing, coughing or touching nose in the past 3 days\" compared to 80% of female respondents, obtained at least secondary education (2 = 17.05, p0.001) we limited stratification to gender and age only and acknowledge that this also incorporates indefinable education and income effects. we used a multi-group SEM to assess the invariance of the model. a p-value>0.05 indicates a non-significant difference between the models. the characteristics of the sample were compared against the 2006 by-census population data [46], showing respondents to be better educated. understanding of H1N1 cause (Understanding) and Perceived self-efficacy (Self-efficacy) were significantly associated with hand washing while Worry and Susceptibility were significantly associated with social distancing. trust in informal information sources was inversely associated with Susceptibility ( = 0.21), which was associated positively with Worry ( = 0.44), and inversely with Self-efficacy ( = 0.36). inverse association ( = 0.42) between Susceptibility and Self-efficacy. if the path coefficients did not differ significantly between males and females, only the path coefficient for males is presented. for a given path, if the path coefficients did not differ significantly between males and females, only the path coefficient for males is presented. both the least constrained model and the most constrained models fit the data well with CFI>0.970, TLI0.970, RMSEA = 0.025. the most constrained model did not differ significantly from the least constrained model (2 for \u201cDIFFTEST\u201d = 29.30, df = 19, p = 0.061) the number represents standardized path coefficients (p0.05, b p0.01, c p0.001) for a given path, only the path coefficient for males is presented. for both genders, the association between Formal information trust and Understanding was positive. respondents of older age group more likely to trust information from both sources, perceive higher self-efficacy and wash their hands. the strongest associations were between trust in (formal/informal) information, situational awareness variables and different types of health protective behaviours for influenza protection. people are limited in their ability to avoid crowds in Hong Kong, one of the most densely populated cities on earth. but the relatively mild impact of A/H1N1 meant that people saw no reason to jeopardize their economic well-being. men tend to have poorer health knowledge than women, with females showing a stronger association. Neither Worry nor Susceptibility varied significantly by gender or age group. Neither Worry nor Susceptibility varied significantly by gender or age group. this is plausible and theoretically consistent. avoidance would minimize risk of A/H1N1 infection. severity and likelihood of infection were the most important determinants of preventive action. social avoidance appears less amenable to formal health messages. re-ran the SEM treating the two trust items as separate. only one item measured self-efficacy. this was likely due to unavoidable sampling bias from surveying in the early evening to 10pm. trust in Formal information Neither age nor gender contributed significant variation to the association between Trust in Formal information and Self-efficacy and hand hygiene. findings consistent with other studies showing self-efficacy is enhanced by procedural information [18], [19], [47], [48] and that attitudinally and action-oriented interventions are more successful in changing behaviour for communicable disease protection. trust in informal information seems to be associated with less perceived susceptibility to health threat. this may reflect rational processes or cognitive bias. trusting social cues involves comparison and conformity influences, and can enhance optimistic bias in personal risk estimates. social distancing is unassociated with formal HPB messages. this suggests potential susceptibility to a \u201cherd-like\u201d response in this Chinese community. if mixed social messages occur signalling uncertainty then the utility of social information will fall. self-efficacy in preventing A/H1N1 influences hand hygiene. but high levels of trust in these messages are not likely to significantly increase hand hygiene. limitations imposed by need to be parsimonious in questioning due to telephone interviews. these limitations may also have contributed to the low explained variance of the model. a simple version of our findings can be found it the supporting file (Text S1)"}
