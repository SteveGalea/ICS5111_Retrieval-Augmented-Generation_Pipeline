{"summary": "APOBEC3 (A3) enzymes are comprised of either one (A3A, A3C, and A3H) or two (A3D, A3F, A3G, and A3B) zinc-coordinating domains that are grouped into three identified clades based on sequence homology (Z1, Z2, and Z3) (1\u20133) A3H is the most distantly related and is classified as the only Z3 domain. at least two family members, APOBEC1 (38) and A3A (39), exhibit RNA-editing capabilities. RNA binding has also been implicated in maintaining proper subcellular localization for at least three different A3s. RNA plays a pivotal role in regulating A3 activities. distinct nucleolar and cytoplasmic localization patterns for native (untagged) and mCherry (mCh)-tagged enzymes. further characterization of these properties identified structural determinants on the surface of A3H that regulate subcellular localization by genetically separable mechanisms. we propose a model in which A3H contains overlapping structural zipcodes that regulate steady-state subcellular localization. mCh-A3H has 1, 2, or 3 copies of mCherry coexpressed with fibrillarin-eGFP. Arrows indicate regions of interest (ROI) to test this idea, we generated 1, 2, and 3 mCh-A3H constructs and expressed them in 293T cells. the maximum size of a protein that can passively diffuse through the nuclear pore is 60 to 70 kDa (61\u201363); therefore, the addition of multiple copies of mCherry would render A3H too big to passively diffuse into the nuclear compartment. we hypothesized that accumulation of A3H within nucleoli occurs through binding to unknown nucleolar factors. long-term treatment of 293T cells with AMD resulted in partial relocalization of FBL-eGFP from nucleolar to nuclear, indicating nucleolar disassembly. analysis of the A3H protein sequence using a prediction algorithm based on known nucleolar retention sequences (74, 75) suggested that a nucleolar targeting sequence may exist within loop 1. however, numerous proteins have been characterized as having targeting sequences comprised of stretches of basic amino acids (76, 77) nucleolar targeting sequence in loop 1 is required for nucleolar localization. alignment of A3H, A3A, and A3B C-terminal domain amino acid sequences flanking loop 1 (dashed line) chimeras exchanging loop 1 and either loop 7 or -helix 6 relocalize A3A to the nucleus through an active import mechanism. chimeras exchanged loop 7 or -helix 6 alone or in combination with loop 1. neither loop 7 nor -helix 6 alone had any effect on localization. lix 6 can relocalize A3A to the nucleus through an active import mechanism. chimeras with loop 1 exchanged from either A3H or A3B alone or in combination with loop 7 or -helix 6. chimeras shown in Fig. 4 were due to the presence of A3H loop 1. we tested the exchange of A3B C-terminal domain (CTD) loop 1 alone or in combination with loop 7 or -helix 6 from A3H. the chimeras failed to relocalize to the nuclear compartment in all cell lines tested. relocalization of the A3A chimeras to the nucleus was interesting. we examined the structures of A3H and A3A, looking for regions outside the RNA binding interface that are significantly different. exchanging loop 3 alone had no effect on A3A localization; however, exchanging loop 3 along with the RNA binding surface from A3H resulted in strong nucleolar accumulation. cis elements on the surface of A3H work cohesively to promote nucleolar localization. chimeric constructs still failed to recapitulate A3H cytoplasmic localization. we compared amino acid sequences from these related A3Z3s to human A3H and A3AA3H-RNA+L3. chimera displayed a dual-localization pattern similar to that of wild-type A3H. we exchanged -helix 1 in combination with loop 9 and deletion of the \u201cWG\u201d sequence at the top of -helix 3. we observed no discernible differences in localization patterns. we tested the A3A chimeras that displayed either nucleolar/cytoplasmic localization or nuclear/nucleolar localization for their ability to restrict Vif-deficient HIV-1 particles. because of this, we performed viral infectivity assays with Vif-deficient HIV-1 proviral plasmids to accurately assess antiviral activity of the A3A/H chimeras. this is the first instance in which the virus-targeting mechanism from one A3 enzyme mCherry (mCh) fluorescence tag and still observed dual localization in 293T cells. two C-terminal splice variants of 182 and 200 residues in length had indistinguishable localization patterns. arrows indicate regions of interest (ROI) to test for nucleolar localization, we coexpressed mCh-A3H with enhanced green fluorescent protein-tagged fibrillarin (FBL-eGFP) the bulk of the nuclear A3H overlapped with FBL-eGFP in nucleolar structures. recently, we discovered that A3H forms RNA-mediated homodimers and that disruption of the dimer results in strong nuclear enrichment. treatment of 293T cells with lepB resulted in nuclear accumulation of AID-mCh. however, lepB treatment of cells expressing mCh-A3H did not display nuclear enrichment or increased nuclear accumulation. this suggests that A3H is not rapidly exported from the nucleus through a CRM1-mediated pathway. wild-type A3H and three separation-of-function mutants showed similar levels of nucleolar accumulation. we were surprised by these results because they suggested that nucleolar retention of A3H is not due to RNA binding activity but rather that A3H may be targeted specifically to this compartment by a yet-unknown nucleolar factor. a predicted nucleolar targeting sequence in loop 1 is required for nucleolar localization. the predicted nucleolar localization sequence of A3H is indicated by the solid line. ns, no significance; ***, P 0.001 by the unpaired Student t test. structure-guided analysis allows for structure-guided analysis between A3A and A3H. all initial studies using A3A as a molecular scaffolding were done with the catalytically inactive E72A mutant to avoid cytotoxicity. exchanging loop 1 from A3H had no discernible effect on localization when expressed in 293T, U2OS, or HeLa cells. neither loop 7 nor -helix 6 alone had any effect on A3A localization (similar to exchange of loop 1 alone) either loop 7 or -helix 6 residues were sufficient to relocalize A3A to the nucleus in all cell lines tested. relocalization of A3A chimeras shown in Fig. 4 was due to presence of A3H loop 1. the chimeras failed to relocalize to the nuclear compartment in all cells tested. the results suggest that components of the RNA binding interface may have overlapping functions as localization determinants. exchanging the entire A3H RNA binding interface in A3A would result in an A3H-like nucleolus/cytoplasm localization pattern. we examined the structures of A3H and A3A, looking for regions outside the RNA binding interface that are significantly different. exchanging loop 3 alone had no effect on A3A localization. however, exchanging loop 3 along with the RNA binding surface from A3H resulted in strong nucleolar accumulation. however, replacement of individual residues K50, K51, and K52 by glutamate also caused nucleolar accumulation to be strongly reduced. we compared amino acid sequences from these related A3Z3s to human A3H and A3AA3H-RNA+L3 to identify amino acid residues that were conserved among A3Z3s. excluding these residues would reveal additional determinants involved in cytoplasmic retention that were not apparent in the cocrystal structure of A3H in complex with duplexed RNA. a representative image of each enzyme is shown above the corresponding viral infectivity results. the asterisk indicates a nonspecific band in the viral particle blot. we tested the A3A chimeras that displayed either nucleolar/cytoplasmic localization or nuclear/nucleolar localization for their ability to restrict HIV-1. DISCUSSION Human A3H is the only single-domain enzyme to display potent antiviral activity against HIV-1. engraftment of cytoplasmic retention determinants from A3H into A3A proved sufficient to change A3A's \u201czipcode\u201d to relocalize it from a cell-wide state to the cytosol predominantly and to endow it with antiviral activity against HIV-1. some determinants involved in the cytoplasmic retention/RNA binding mechanism are also involved in mediating nucleolar localization, resulting in partly overlapping structural zipcodes. if our model of partially overlapping determinants were correct, one might expect loop 3 to be included as part of the RNA binding surface. era data in Fig. 5C and D, as well as by the single-amino-acid substitutions shown in Fig. 5E and F. computational modeling predicts that the duplexed RNA phosphate backbone interacts with loop 3 of A3H. nucleol accumulation of A3A requires that the entire A3H RNA binding surface be exchanged in combination with loop 3. this model also raises the interesting possibility of A3H regulation by a specific RNA(s) in each subcellular compartment. many viral proteins are known to travel through the nucleoli from diverse viral families such as Herpesviridae, Coronaviridae, and Flaviviridae (95\u2013101). methyl-cytosine editing may also be able to accommodate RNA cytosine bases and edit RNA cytosines to uracils. this may protect this compartment from viruses that partially, or fully, require nucleolar translocation. all mCh-A3 expression plasmids were cloned into a pQCXIH retroviral expression vector. a similar approach was taken to generate chimeric A3A/A3H constructs. cells were washed three times for 5 min each with PBS. then incubated in rabbit anti-A3H primary antibody overnight at 4\u00b0C. slides were imaged on a Nikon inverted Ti-E deconvolution microscope. 50 to 100 ng of the indicated mCh-A3 construct was transfected into the indicated cell lines and imaged 48 h later. for experiments without FBL-eGFP, 50 to 100 ng of the indicated mCh-A3 construct was transfected into the indicated cell lines. images were collected at a magnification of 40 using a color microscope. 250,000 293T cells were plated into a 12-well culture plate and allowed to adhere overnight. cells were transfected with 100 ng of an HIV-1 vif-, vpr-, vpu-, env-, and nef-deficient eGFP reporter virus. eGFP-positive cells were analyzed using flow cytometry. cell pellets were resuspended in 100 l radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 140 mM NaCl) samples were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. nucleolar fluorescence intensity was determined by subtracting background fluorescence intensity from mCh-A3H fluorescence intensity within defined nucleolar compartments. the nucleolar compartments were defined by coexpression of FBL-eGFP with the indicated mCh-A3H mutants. all mCh-A3 expression plasmids were cloned into a pQCXIH retroviral expression vector. a similar approach was taken to generate chimeric A3A/A3H constructs. overlapping PCR was used to combine the two amplicons. cells were washed three times for 5 min each with PBS and then incubated in rabbit anti-A3H primary antibody. they were then incubated in goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody\u2013fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) at 1:1,000 dilution in blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature. slides were imaged on a Nikon inverted Ti-E deconvolution microscope. 50 to 100 ng of the indicated mCh-A3 construct was transfected into the indicated cell lines. images were collected at a magnification of 40 using an EVOS FL color microscope. at least 90% of the cells imaged for each experimental condition showed the same localization pattern. 250,000 293T cells were plated into a 12-well culture plate and allowed to adhere overnight. the next day, cells were transfected with 100 ng of an HIV-1 vif-, vpr-, vpu-, env-, and nef-deficient eGFP reporter virus. 100 l of the viral medium was used to transduce 250,000 fresh 293T cells. assay buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl [pH 8.0], 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, and 140 mM NaCl) samples were pelleted through a 20% sucrose cushion for 2 h at 20,000 g at 4\u00b0C.
