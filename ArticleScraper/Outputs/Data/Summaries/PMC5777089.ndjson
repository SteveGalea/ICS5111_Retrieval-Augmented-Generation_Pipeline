{"summary": "interfacial curvature effects on the monolayer morphology and dynamics of a clinical lung surfactant Amit Kumar Sachan and Joseph A. Zasadzinski Confocal microscopy provide high-resolution images of highly curved interfaces. this is due to the anisotropic bending properties of the semicrystalline liquid-condensed (LC) domains that lead to a transition between discrete, discontinuous domains on a flat interface to an interconnected meshwork on al we constructed a database of historical and archaeological information from 30 regions around the world over the last 10,000 years. our analyses revealed that characteristics, such as social scale, economy, features of governance, and information systems, show strong evolutionary relationships with each other. our findings highlight the power of the sciences and humanities working together. the Enterobacteriaceae family of Proteobacteria maintains DNA operator- and glucuronidated ligand-specific glucuronide repressor (GusR) transcription factors that uniquely respond to glucuronidated ligands. the small intestine contains Proteobacteria and Firmicutes that degrade complex carbohydrates. coVs have acquired nsp14, a bifunctional enzyme able to methylate the viral RNA cap [methyltransferase (MTase)] and excise erroneous mutagenic nucleotides inserted by nsp12. this unprecedented RNA correction machinery has allowed RNA genome size expansion, but also provided potential nucleoside drug resistance to these deadly pathogens. gene-wide CRISPR screen for PARKIN regulators reveals transcriptional repression as a determinant of mitophagy Christoph Potting, Christophe Crochemore, Francesca Moretti, Florian Nigsch, Isabel Schmidt, Carole Manneville, Walter Carbone, Judith Knehr, Rowena DeJesus, Alicia Lindeman, Rob Maher, Carsten Russ, Gregory McAllister, Gregory R. Hoffman, Guglielmo Roma, we have defined a mechanism by which RSK2 can promote cell migration and invasion in response to promotility stimuli. we show that in response to these signals RSK2 directly binds the RhoGEF LARG and phosphorylates it, thereby promoting LARG activation of RhoA GTPases. these results advance our understanding of cell motility, RSK kinase function, and the precise mechanism by which that is accomplished. we used thousands of genetic markers to demonstrate that the recently rediscovered golden-crowned manakin represents an avian hybrid species from the amazon basin. this hybrid species has a unique golden-colored crown patch used for display, which differs from the brilliant white coloration of the parental species. cicada endosymbionts have repeatedly and independently fractured into complexes of distinct genomic and cellular lineages present in the same host. cicada endosymbionts show genomic parallels to mitochondria and provide another example of how normally stable genomes can lose structural stability. the relative roles of gene flow and natural selection in creating two species remains open for debate. we found that these genomic islands of divergence most likely came about by selective processes. histone demethylase LSD1 regulates hematopoietic stem cells homeostasis. phenotype of mutant mice carrying subtle mutations in Foxp3 suggests rare FOXP3 variants may contribute to a broader range of human diseases than previously recognized. encapsulation system can be retrieved or replaced whenever needed. cell encapsulation device is readily scalable and easily retrievable. encapsulation device may contribute to a cellular therapy for type 1 diabetes and potentially other endocrine disorders and hormone-deficient diseases. a causality link remains to be established between colorectal cancer and intestinal dysbiosis or colonization by single bacterial species such as Streptococcus gallolyticus subsp. gallolyticus. we colonized Apc+/ notch-inducible mice with SGG. ataxia-telangiectasia (A-T) and Seckel syndrome (ATM and ATR deficiency, respectively) these findings have potential relevance to a much broader range of neurologic conditions. cell-specific and region-specific transcriptomics in the multiple sclerosis model. us coeruleus (LC) in the brain stem is known to respond to novel sensory stimuli. we found that the hippocampal CA3 subregion is the crucial target of LC projections during the encoding of a novel context. this study provides evidence that LC neuromodulation plays a crucial role in memory formation of a new context. ili Zheng, Arne Klungland, and wei Yan N6-methyladnosine (m6A) represent one of the most common RNA modifications. the present study represents the first molecular characterization of the Alkbh5 knockout mouse model. gene, ZmCCT10, arose sequentially following domestication. new functional variation created by transposon insertions helped maize spread rapidly."}
