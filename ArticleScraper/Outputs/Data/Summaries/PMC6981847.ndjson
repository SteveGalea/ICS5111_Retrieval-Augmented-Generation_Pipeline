{"summary": "non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) play an important role in delaying the first wave, reducing its peak and the spreading of new influenza cases across time. isolation of infected people has been applied to minimize the spread of pandemic diseases at least since the Old Testament period. many scholars believe isolation has a great impact on preventing or delaying the spread of pandemics. the effectiveness of voluntary SI largely depends on public adherence to this intervention measure [14]. however, the factors involved in SI should not be neglected. it is important to investigate which factors will encourage infected people to choose self-isolation. conceptual model and hypotheses Several theories explain social behaviors [25] one is the theory of planned behavior (TPB), which is widely applied to explain many types of behaviors. the TPB proposes that the individual is influenced by three factors. people are sensitive to the conformity pressures associated with real and perceived social norms as related to risk behavior [35]. SN refers to the perceived ease or difficulty of performing the behavior, and it is assumed to reflect past experience as well as anticipated obstacles [26]. the resources available to a person must, to some extent, dictate the likelihood of behavioral achievement [26]. a market research company, LTD, was entrusted to carry out an online survey of pandemic prevention from 14 October to 3 November in 2018. the survey included the following steps: demographic characteristics such as gender, age, and education status. 121 county-level units and 21 county-level city units were selected according to the statistical yearbook of Guangdong province. \"Do you agree or disagree with the government\u2019s mandatory isolation of infected people during a large-scale epidemic of an infectious disease\"\" \"if you were infected with a pandemic disease, would you let your neighbors or colleagues know\"\" \"if you were infected, would you let your neighbors or colleagues know\" NS divided into two kinds of social pressure, from neighbors and from the health department, which were measured by the two questions below. the individual and family\u2019s risk perception of pandemics, and confidence to protect the family from a pandemic. the statistical analysis was implemented using the statistical software Stata/MP. 3.1. Study Area SARS was first recognized in Guangdong Province, China, in November 2002. more than 7900 patients were infected in 30 countries [50] infected people were isolated at home for 10 days because of exposure to large-scale infectious disease patients, do you think you could do it. the health department has a mandatory isolation of infected people during a large-scale epidemic of an infectious disease. we divided SN into two kinds of social pressure, from neighbors and from the health department, which were measured by the two questions below. the individual and family\u2019s risk perception of pandemics, and confidence to protect the family from a pandemic. the statistical analysis was implemented using the statistical software Stata/MP, version 14.0 (StataCorp LP., Texas City, USA). results Table 2 provides descriptive statistics for the dependent and independent variables. 8.83% said they could not isolate themselves, 75.69% said they could, and 15.48% were unsure. the mean score of SI in Guangdong prefecture-level cities was between 3.4 and 4.1 out of 5, which indicates people have more willingness to self-isolate. 0.026 0.057 ** 0.011 0.411 *** 1 Edu 0.069 *** 0.009 0.032 0.080 *** 0.066 *** 0.316 *** 1 Marriage 0.113 *** 0.083 *** 0.112 *** 0.077 *** 0.228 *** 0.620 *** 0.007 1 Soci Eco 0.072 *** 0.001 0.127 *** 0.017 0.011 0.118 *** 0.349 *** 0.049 ** 1 TL 0.077 *** 0.210 *** 0.131 *** 0.009 0.086 *** 0.007 0.103 *** 0.172 *** 0.172 *** 0.024 0.019 0.003 0.084 *** 0.119 *** 0.107 *** 1 Chronic 0.005 0.006 0.011 0.002 0.005 0.023 0.059 ** 0.020 0.097 *** 0.090 *** 0.040 * 0.002 0.004 0.052 ** 0.203 *** * 0.116 * 0.059 0.043 (2.51) (2.03) (1.19) (0.88) SS 0.143 *** 0.124 *** 0.037 0.029 (5.76) (5.30) (1.82) (1.43) TL 0.104 *** 0.067 ** 0.068 ** 0.059 ** (3.79) (2.62) (3.06) (2.69) TG 0.109 *** 0.106 *** 0.056 * 0.024 (3.86) (3.99) (2.42) (1.04) CR ATT has the most important effect on SI; when ATT increases by 1%, the willingness to self-isolate will increase by 0.443%. when SN increases by 1%, the willingness to self-isolate will increase by 0.162%. when PBC increases by 1%, the willingness to self-isolate will increase by 0.082%. there are some regional differences. the control variables (including community resources, emergency services, and families with old people) have significant influences on SI in the Pearl River Delta. in eastern Guangdong, age, education, socioeconomic, trust in leadership, and families with old people have important influences on SI.

ATT, SN, and PBC influence the willingness of self-isolate when facing a pandemic risk. ATT, SN, and PBC have significant positive influences on SI when facing a pandemic emergency."}
