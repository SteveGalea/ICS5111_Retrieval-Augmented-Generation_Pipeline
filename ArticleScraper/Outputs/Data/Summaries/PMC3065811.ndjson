{"summary": "despite recommendations that cesarean section rates not exceed 15% [4, 5], many countries have rates double or even triple that threshold [3]. china, home to one-fifth of the world's population and 12 percent of all births annually [6, 7] is no different. a meta-analytic review of the optimism literature from 2009 found a persistent relationship between optimism and positive health outcomes. dispositional optimism is seen as a relatively stable personality characteristic (a \u201ctrait\u201d rather than a \u201cstate\u201d) that is associated with general assumptions about positive future outcomes. women who were most pessimistic were more likely to get tested for HIV. optimism or pessimism associated with unplanned cesarean section. optimistic counterparts less likely to get tested. women were given a self-administered survey to complete before their appointment. the survey included administering a demographic and health questionnaire and the Life Orientation Test (LOT-R) women were asked to enumerate any pregnancy complications or symptoms they had during pregnancy. the LOT-R is one of the most commonly used measures of optimism/pessimism. it includes 6 scored items and 4 fillers that generate an overall score. it includes two possible subscales: an optimism subscale and a pessimism subscale. women who delivered vaginally or via planned cesarean section treated as one group. additional data collected from the medical record included gestational age of the infant at delivery, birthweight, labor duration, use of pain medication, 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores. all data were analyzed using SPSS statistical software, Version 17.1 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL) logistic regression analysis was conducted with optimism and pessimism regressed on unplanned cesarean section (yes/no) the additional clinical factors of labor duration, birth complications, previous abortion, previous miscarriage, pregnancy complications, gestational age, infant birth weight, and self-rated difficulty of the pregnancy added into the model. women were given a self-administered survey to complete before their appointment. the survey was designed to be self-administered, but women were given the option to have it administered verbally. the LOT-R has been widely validated [38] and used in china [39\u201346]. it includes 6 scored items and 4 fillers that generate an overall score. the items that make up the pessimism subscale are (1) in uncertain times, I usually expect the best; (2) I'm always optimistic about my future and (3) overall, I expect more good things to happen to me than bad. data collected from the medical record included gestational age of the infant at delivery, birthweight, labor duration, use of pain medication, 1-minute and 5-minute Apgar scores, and any of a number of delivery or birth complications. all factors were combined into a single dichotomous variable termed birth complications. binary logistic regression analysis was conducted with optimism and pessimism regressed on unplanned cesarean section (yes/no) the additional clinical factors of labor duration, birth complications, previous abortion, previous miscarriage, pregnancy complications, gestational age, infant birth weight, and self-rated difficulty of the pregnancy added into the model. results Two hundred fifty-one women were asked to participate, and 227 met our eligibility criteria and agreed to participate. 78 (91.8) P =.695 (NS) Hui 2 (1.5) Xian 1 (0.7) Xian 1 (1.2) Other 3 (2.2) Other 4 (4.7) Missing = 4 Missing = 1 Highest level of education HS grad or less 19 (13.5) College Grad or less 90 (63.8) Graduate/Professional Degree or less 32 (22.6) HS grad or less 23 (27.3) College Grad or less 51 (60.7) Graduate/Professional Degree or more than half of our sample has had at least one previous pregnancy that was either spontaneously or electively terminated. only 2.8 percent of women report having anything other than mild complications in this current pregnancy. somewhat easy 36 (25.5) Somewhat easy 12 (20.7) Somewhat difficult 4 (8.6) Extremely difficult 1 (1.7) Medical insurance Gov't issued 85 (60.2) P =.316 (NS) Employer or private Employer or private Insurance 46 (32.5) Insurance 29 (46.3) No insurance 10 (7.1) No insurance 11 (13.7) Missing = 6 Seen a doctor, counselor, or other professional for emotional issues Ever 5 (3.5) 4 (4.8) P =.653 (NS) Mean gest most common pregnancy complications Anemia 26 (18.4) Gestational diabetes 13 (9.2) Elderly primigravida 9 (6.4) IntraUterine Infection 8 (5.7) Macrosomia 8 (5.7) Most common delivery/birth complications Fetal Distress 58 (41.1) Preterm Mem. rupture 36 (25.5) Umbilical cord 24 (17.0) Delayed labor 10 (7.1) Hemorrhage 5 (3.5) Preeclampsia 5 (3.5) Preterm labor 2 (1.4 no other demographic or clinical factors were significantly associated with unplanned cesarean section. no other demographic or clinical factors were significantly associated with unplanned cesarean section. unadjusted model in which both optimism and pessimism were regressed against unplanned cesarean section delivery. pessimism OR = 1.28, 95% CI: 1.06, 1.56, P =.01; optimism OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.71, 1.08; P =.22. pessimism remained significantly associated with unplanned cesarean section. labor duration and birth complications were the only clinical factors in the adjusted model that had a significant relationship to unplanned cesarean section delivery. study showed an association between higher levels of generalized maternal pessimism during pregnancy. pessimism showed a significant association with unplanned cesarean section deliveries, while levels of optimism did not. this is useful in reaffirming that optimism and pessimism are two separate constructs rather than poles on a continuum [55, 56], but is also instructive in potential interventions during pregnancy. fetal distress, preeclampsia, prolonged/obstructed labor, or shoulder dystocia are primary indications for cesarean section delivery. it is also not surprising that duration of labor is associated with unplanned cesarean section. it is also not surprising that women who delivered vaginally in this sample had longer labors than those who had unplanned cesarean sections. this study reveals what some would call excessively high episiotomy, cesarean section, and forceps rates, limiting its generalizability to settings without similar rates. this study asked women to self-report their pregnancy complications. it was not possible to verify these self-reports against medical records data. current knowledge on this subject \u2014 Cesarean section rates are rising, due, in large part, to nonclinical factors. maternal cognitive predispositions during pregnancy (specifically optimism/pessimism) have not been examined in relation to unplanned cesarean section deliveries. this study also includes women in their last trimester of pregnancy. it also reveals what some would call excessively high episiotomy, cesarean section, and forceps rates. this study also reveals what some would call excessively high episiotomy, cesarean section, and forceps rates. current knowledge on this subject \u2014 Cesarean section rates are rising, due, in large part, to nonclinical factors. maternal cognitive predispositions during pregnancy have not been examined in relation to unplanned cesarean section deliveries. pessimism during pregnancy appears to be associated even when clinical factors are controlled."}
