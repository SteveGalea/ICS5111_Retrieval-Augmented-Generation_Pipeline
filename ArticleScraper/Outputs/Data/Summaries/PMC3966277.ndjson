{"summary": "Sprague\u2013Dawley rats were free of rat coronavirus, rat Theiler virus, Kilham rat virus, rat parvovirus, toolan H1 virus, rat minute virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, murine adenovirus types 1 and 2, reovirus type 3, sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice. rats were weighed on the day prior to surgery and every day postoperatively until eu the plantar surface of the left (ipsilateral) hindpaw of each rat was prepared aseptically for surgery. the plantaris muscle was isolated, elevated slightly, and then incised longitudinally with care to avoid trauma to sites of muscle attachment. all rats were monitored closely until they recovered from anesthesia and then returned to their home cage. rats were allowed 15 to 30 min to acclimate after being moved to the behavioral testing room. rats were tested between 0900 and 1100 at 1 d prior to surgery. each hindpaw was tested 4 days after surgery. withdrawal latency was measured as the mean of the last 3 trials. withdrawal latency was measured as the mean of the last 3 trials. the right hindpaw served as a control. rats were weighed on the day prior to surgery and every day postoperatively until euthanasia. rats were euthanized by carbon dioxide asphyxiation followed by physical methods. rats were maintained on a nonrebreathing anesthetic circuit mask by using isoflurane in 100% O2. rats were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 groups: Bup HCl (n = 3), rats received Bup HCl at 0.05 mg/kg SC 15 min prior to skin incision. 0.3 Bup-SR (n = 6), rats received Bup-SR at 0.3 mg/kg SC 15 min prior to surgery. prior to behavioral studies, rats were allowed 15 to 30 min to acclimate after being moved to the behavioral testing room. mechanical hypersensitivity was defined as a significant increase in paw withdrawal response frequency evoked by mechanical stimuli. the right hindpaw (contralateral) served as a control. both hindpaws were tested over 10 consecutive trials. each stimulus was applied for approximately 1 s with an interstimulus interval of approximately 5 s. the pads, toes, and heels were avoided. the weight of rats in the Bup HCl, 0.3 Bup-SR, and 1.2 Bup-SR groups were similar before and after surgery throughout the study. but the weight of rats in the 4.5 Bup-SR group was clinically (>10%) but not significantly reduced on days 3 (340.75 12.15 g) and 4 (350.7 8.3 g) compared with the baseline value (381.25 11.65 g; Figure 3). differences were detected for the contralateral hindpaw between groups at any time point. effects of Bup HCl or Bup-SR at various dosages (mg/kg) on mechanical hypersensitivity of (A) ipsilateral and (B) contralateral paws. withdrawal latency in the contralateral paw differed (P 0.05) between time points in the 1.2 Bup-SR and 4.5 Bup-SR groups. this result is likely due to sedation, which was detected clinically in both groups. sedation was severe in rats that received 4.5 mg/kg Bup-SR. 0.3 Bup-SR, 1.2 Bup-SR, and 4.5 Bup-SR groups did not differ. no significant differences were detected for the contralateral hindpaw between groups at any time point. value in the 0.3 Bup-SR group failed to return to baseline thermal latency between 48 and 72 h. withdrawal latency in the contralateral paw differed (P 0.05) between time points in the 1.2 and 4.5 Bup-SR groups. this result is likely due to sedation, which was detected clinically in both groups. mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity in rats that received a single dose of 0.3 mg/kg Bup-SR was no different for at least 72 h than those associated with twice-daily dosing of Bup HCl. lack of a significant decrease in thermal latency through day 2 provides evidence that 0.3 mg/kg Bup-SR SC was effective in diminishing thermal hypersensitivity to a point similar to baseline for at least 48 h. 0.3 mg/kg Bup-SR did not result in any observable clinical effects. none of the rats in the 1.2 and 1.2 Bup-SR groups lost more than 10% of body weight. Bup-SR administered subcutaneously at 1.2 mg/kg maintained plasma levels greater than 1 ng/mL for more than 72 h. plasma levels of 0.1 mg/kg peaked at 2.8 ng/mL and declined to 1.4 ng/mL at 8 h. previous studies have reported skin lesions, ulcerations, self-mutilation and scabbing at the site of administration. a single 1.2 mg/kg dose of Bup-SR (Zoo-Pharm) for a 350-g rat is $1.47, whereas its standard-of-care equivalent (6 doses of Bup HCl) would cost $5.10. this difference in cost does not include labor charges, which would further increase the difference between total expenses."}
