{"summary": "80% of respiratory infections cases are caused by viral pathogens such as influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20133, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and others. the non-specific clinical presentation of respiratory infections poses a considerable challenge to the differential diagnosis of these pathogens. EM requires strict control of experimental conditions, a high concentration of viral particles (> 105 L-1) and considerable technical skill and expertise for accurate analysis. adenovirus, influenza A/B, RSV, and human parainfluenza viruses are the most common respiratory viruses that are isolated and detected by cell culture. culture is also the gold standard for detection of atypical (bacterial) respiratory pathogens. culture is also the gold standard for detection of atypical (bacterial) respiratory pathogens, followed by identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. commercially available RIAs are mostly limited to the detection of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV. commercially available immunoassays have demonstrated high sensitivity (93%) for detection of RSV. pediatric patients often shed higher titers of respiratory viruses and for a longer time as compared to adults. adenovirus (62 and 100%), adenovirus (94 and 96%), and parainfluenza viruses (88 and 99.7%) serological tests can successfully identify antibodies to most respiratory pathogens such as RSV, adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1-3 virus, etc. serological testing is particularly challenging for identifying atypical bacterial agents such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. serological tests are not relevant for identifying frequently recurring viral infections as serum IgM levels are lower due to repeated exposure to vaccines or circulating viruses. adenovirus, influenza A/B, RSV, and human parainfluenza viruses are the most common respiratory viruses that are isolated and detected by cell culture. traditional tube culture methods such as the centrifugation enhanced shell-vial method have reduced the turnaround time from 5 to 10 days to 24 h. RIAs are relatively inexpensive, easy to perform, and most have waived status in the united states according to the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act. commercially available RIAs are mostly limited to the detection of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV. commercially available immunoassays have demonstrated high sensitivity (93%) for detection of RSV. the sensitivity of RSV RIAs is relatively higher for children (81%) than adults (29%). pediatric patients often shed higher titers of respiratory viruses and for a longer time as compared to adults. rapid immunoassays (RIAs) can deliver test results in less than 30 min. RIAs are relatively inexpensive, easy to perform, and most have waived status in the united states. commercially available RIAs are mostly limited to the detection of influenza A virus, influenza B virus, and RSV. direct fluorescent antibody testing of nasopharyngeal wash specimens considered a rapid and reliable method for detecting respiratory viral infections. commercial DFA kits have demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for multiple respiratory viruses such as hMPV (95 and 100%), adenovirus (62 and 100%), RSV (94 and 96%), and parainfluenza viruses (88 and 99.7%) RT-PCR detected 40% more specimens from pediatric patients that were positive for at least one respiratory virus than were detected by fluorescent antibody assay (FA) serological testing is particularly challenging, especially for identifying atypical bacterial agents such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae. serological tests are not relevant for identifying frequently recurring viral infections as the serum IgM levels are lower due to repeated exposure to vaccines or circulating viruses. several types of specimens can be used for detection of respiratory viruses. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), throat swab, nasopharyngeal (NP) washes, NP aspirates, lung aspirates, and NP swabs. the appropriate specimen type depends on the specific patient population. 2 h Moderate FilmArray\u00ae respiratory panel (RP) BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Nested multiplex RT-PCR Multiplex Panel (20 targets) NPS 1 h Moderate FilmArray\u00ae respiratory panel 2 (RP2) BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Nested multiplex RT-PCR Multiplex Panel (14 targets) NPS 1 h Waived Lyra\u00ae parainfluenza virus assay Quidel Corporation Real-time RT-PCR Parainfluenza virus pertussis, B. parapertussis NPS 2 h Moderate SimplexaTM flu A/B & RSV direct Focus Diagnostics, Inc., Real-time RT-PCR Flu A, Flu B, and RSV NPS 2 h Moderate Xpert\u00ae flu/RSV XC Cepheid Real-time RT-PCR Flu A, Flu B, and RSV NPS, NA, and NW 1 h Moderate Solana RSV + Abbott Laboratories Isothermal nucleic acid amplification Flu A, Flu B NPS, NS 15 min Waived aFDA 510(k) Premarket Notification (FDA, 2018a) large syndromic panels can detect multiple pathogens simultaneously are beneficial for infection control, timely treatment decisions. studies have reported increased diagnostic yield (60% vs. 35%) and considerably higher sensitivity (80\u2013100%) and specificity (82\u2013100%) for these assays when compared to conventional diagnostic methods such as DFA, viral isolation, and immunoassays. sensitivity and specificity might vary for individual targets. high-plex sample-to-answer panels can detect up to 12\u201320 pathogens based on the panel size. the high-plex panels can detect up to 12\u201320 pathogens based on the panel size. the high-plex panels can detect up to 12\u201320 pathogens based on the panel size. despite a short turnaround time of 1\u20132 h, clinical utility of these assays has been questioned. no statistically significant reduction in antibiotic prescription rates or mortality has been observed between patients who tested positive for a non-influenza virus and those who tested negative. smaller panels targeting a few pathogens can be run independently (random access) or simultaneously (random batch) could be a viable option for controlling laboratory costs. however, it is recommended that other assay characteristics such as ease of use, panel composition, total turnaround time, hands-on time, and cost be considered before implementing an assay in various clinical settings. Molecular POC tests can be costly and more prone to incorrect results and contamination. the assays are usually performed by non-laboratory personnel and poor training, failure to follow manufacturer\u2019s instructions and failure to perform adequate quality control might affect the accuracy of results. higher sensitivity (80\u2013100%) and specificity (82\u2013100%) for these assays compared to conventional diagnostic methods such as DFA, viral isolation, and immunoassays. the overall sensitivity ranged between (83\u2013100%) when the NxTAG RPP and the Anyplex II RV16 assays were evaluated for detection of respiratory pathogens. FDA-cleared sample-to-answer test systems include low-plex, targeted assays and high-plex panels that can detect multiple pathogens and pathogen classes. these tests usually have low to moderate sample throughput (e.g., 1\u201312 samples/run), but have faster turnaround times when compared to batched, high throughput, multiplex panels. no statistically significant reduction in antibiotic prescription rates or mortality has been observed between patients who tested positive for a non-influenza virus and those who tested negative. the primary concerns for the high-plex sample-to-answer assays are high cost per test, and the inability to order customized, targeted panels. low-plex integrated respiratory test systems typically target 1\u20134 pathogens per assay.
