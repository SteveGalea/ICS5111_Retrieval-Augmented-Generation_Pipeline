{"summary": "programmed-1 ribosomal frameshifting is the most widely used translational recoding mechanism of many viruses. ribosomal frameshifting is required for the expression of protease, reverse transcriptase and integrase. ANXA2 is a multi-functional protein that has been implicated in a number of cellular functions. it was found to bind some mRNA transcripts, such as c-myc, collagen prolyl 4-hydroxylasea (I) and its own mRNA [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. ANXA2 may bind to some RNA elements involved in translational regulation. the present results offer a clue for the role of ANXA2 as a RBP for other cellular RNA transcripts. RNA structure of wild-type and mutant IBV pseudoknot RNA was predicted to fold into pseudoknot structure. mutant IBV RNA was not able to form a pseudoknot structure. mutant IBV pseudoknot RNAs were end-labeled with biotin to serve as bait for cellular proteins that might precipitate with streptavidin-coated beads. RNA was in vitro transcribed in the presence of 4-thio UTP that could serve as crosslinker for directly interacting proteins. IMR90 cell extracts were incubated with either wild-type or mutant IBV pseudoknot RNA. the extracts were incubated with either wild-type or mutant IBV pseudoknot RNA. unbound proteins (sup) were also analyzed as a control. ANXA2 specifically binds to pseudoknot RNA. the previous experiment indicated the possible interaction of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA. calcium did not cause any change in the binding of ANXA2 to IBV pseudoknot RNA. RNA-protein complexes were resolved using native polyacrylamide gels. only a single shifted band was generated in the presence of ANXA2 protein but not with the same amount of the GST protein. LNCaP cells were co-transfected with reporters (wild-type or mutant IBV pseudoknot plasmid Wild-type or mutant) and ANXA2 expression plasmids (Flag-vector or Flag-ANXA2) after formaldehyde fixation, immunoprecipitations were performed with FLAG-M2 agarose beads. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in agarose gel and visualized by staining with e ANXA2 regulates ribosomal frameshifting of IBV pseudoknot RNA. luciferase reporter expressed firefly luciferase as well as Renilla luciferase. control reporters with either in frame or no expression of firefly luciferase. the downregulation of the ANXA2 by three independent knockdowns greatly increased the relative frameshifting efficiency of IBV pseudoknot RNA in HEK293T cells. ANXA2 controls the frameshifting efficiency in the cells, which could act as the cellular inhibitor against the frameshifting of viral RNA translation. expression of ANXA2 was confirmed by Western blot analysis. anti-actin antibody was used as a loading control. location of a shRNA and two siRNAs indicated. sequences of wild-type and mutant IBV pseudoknot RNA (72 nts) were generated as in vitro transcribed transcript. RNA structure of wild-type IBV RNA was predicted to fold into pseudoknot structure. mutant IBV RNA was not able to form a pseudoknot structure. IBV pseudoknot RNA was incubated with cell extracts from human lung fibroblast IMR90. the complex was irradiated with 365 nm UV light to directly crosslink interacting proteins to 4-thio UTP incorporated IBV pseudoknot RNA. proteins were eluted from the beads, fractionated by SDS-PAGE and stained with silver staining. IMR90 cell extracts were incubated with the [-32P] labeled Wild-type (WT) or mutant IBV pseudoknot RNA. the same gel as shown on the left was incubated with anti-ANXA2 antibody. radiolabeled RNA was found near the size of the ANXA2 protein. this suggests an interaction between radiolabeled IBV pseudoknot RNA and cellular ANXA2 protein. recombinant ANXA2 protein was purified and used for GST pull-down assay. more radioactivity was recovered after precipitating with GST-ANXA2 in comparison to GST. ANXA2 specifically interacted with wild-type IBV pseudoknot RNA. but not with mutant IBV RNA in LNCaP and HEK293T cells. ANXA2 specifically binds to pseudoknot RNA. RNA was extracted from immune complexes and analyzed by RT-PCR and qRT-PCR. PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in agarose gel and visualized by staining with ethidium bromide. ANXA2 mRNA and IBV PK RNA were also shown as an expression and input controls. luciferase reporter expressed firefly luciferase and Renilla luciferase. control reporters with either in frame or no expression of firefly luciferase used as positive or negative controls. transfection of FLAG-tagged ANXA2 in HEK293T cells reduced the relative frameshifting efficiency of IBV pseudoknot RNA up to 40%. ANXA2 regulates dual luciferase reporters. it could act as the cellular inhibitor against the frameshifting of viral RNA translation. luciferase reporter assay after knockdown of ANXA2 in HEK293T cells. pSUPER vector (Vector) and pSUPER-ANXA2 (shANX2-1) transfected cells. anti-actin antibody was used as a loading control. RNA pseudoknots are structural elements formed upon base-pairing of a single-stranded region to a stretch of complementary nucleotides elsewhere in the RNA chain. RNA pseudoknots are structural elements formed upon base-pairing of a single-stranded region to a stretch of complementary nucleotides elsewhere in the RNA chain. recent advances in RNA bioinformatics broaden the possibility of finding pseudoknot structure from RNA sequences. recent data suggests that the mechanical strength of the pseudoknot structure is correlated with ribosomal frameshifting, with pausing of ribosome itself is not sufficient for frameshifting. the gene linked to Optiz BBB/G syndrome, MID1, is associated with microtubule-associated ribonucleoprotein complex including EF-1a, RACK-1, small ribosomal subunit proteins and ANXA2.
