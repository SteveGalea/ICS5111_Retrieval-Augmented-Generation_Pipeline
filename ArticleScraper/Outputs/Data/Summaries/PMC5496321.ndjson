{"summary": "the importance of building a strong immune system is becoming more important for good health. there is a close correlation between immune responses and inflammation. UC is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) it is estimated that 1-2 million people in the united states suffer from IBD. the roots of Cynanchum wilfordii Hemsley are referred to as Cynanchi wilfordii Radix in the Korean Pharmacopoeia [15] it has many potentially beneficial effects such as antitumor, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. this plant is well-known to contain biologically active compounds, including gagaminine and its glycosides. mouse model of colitis has not yet been reported. we investigated the anti-inflammatory effects of polysaccharides from C. wilfordii on lipopolysaccharide- induced RAW 264.7 macrophages and on DSS-induced chronic colitis in mice. twenty-five mice were divided into 5 groups, with 5 mice per group. Mice in group 1 received regular drinking water for 7 days and then received regular water for 3 days. body weight, food intake, stool consistency, and the presence of gross bleeding were assessed daily. negative 2 5\u201310 Loose stool Positive 3 10\u201315 Diarrhea Positive 4 >15 Diarrhea Gross bleeding (1)Disease activity index = well-formed pellets; loose stool = pasty stool that did not stick to the anus; and diarrhea = liquid stool that stuck to the anus. slides were stained with liquid diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB+) the detection system visualized anti-mouse antibodies (K4001; DAKO, Glostrup, Denmark) the images on the slides were visualized under an Olympus BX40 light microscope. us Oxide (NO) and Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) Production The inhibitory effects of HMFO on NO and PGE2 production were determined using the Griess reagent [29] and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA), respectively. cDNA was synthesized using the cDNA synthesis kit (thermo Scientific, Sankt Leon-Rot, Germany) according to the manufacturer's protocol. target-specific RT-PCR primers were designed for iNOS, COX-2, TNF-a, IL-6, and -actin. HMFO was obtained from a high-molecular-weight fraction of C. wilfordii. the molecular weight range of HMFO was estimated to be between 11.8 and 520.4 kDa. the molecular weight range of HMFO was estimated to be between 11.8 and 520.4 kDa. the mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, and the colons were separated from the proximal rectum. the colon length was measured between the ileocecal junction and the proximal rectum, close to where they passed under the pelvis sternum. colon tissues were thawed and homogenized in lysis buffer. homogenates were centrifuged at 1500 g for 15 min. resulting supernatants were assayed for MPO assay. the images on the slides were visualized under an Olympus BX40 light microscope. scores for assessment of rectal damage were scored 0\u20134 based on the loss of crypts (mucosa) and infiltration of inflammatory cells. Western Blot Analysis Equal amounts of lysates were resolved by sodium dodecyl-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. antibodies against iNOS, total p38, phosphorylated JNK, phosphorylated ERK1/2, total JNK, total ERK1/2, and -actin were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology.

DSS-treated mice showed a significant increase in MPO activity compared to control mice. this increase was drastically decreased in the HMFO-treated group. HMFO administration markedly suppressed MPO accumulation in colonic tissues. HMFO-treated mice had lower serum TNF- concentrations than normal control group. HMFO at 200 mg/kg reversed increase in IL-6- and TNF-positive cells. high levels of proinflammatory cytokine production are a major characteristic of DSS-induced colitis. effects of HMFO on iNOS and COX-2 expression in the colon of colitis mice were detected by Western blot analysis. iNOS and COX-2 expression levels significantly increased in the colon tissues from DSS-treated mice compared to those in normal mice. HMFO administration remarkably reduced iNOS protein upregulation and significantly decreased DSS-induced COX-2 expression. sveratrol decreased COX-2 and iNOS overexpression in mice with colitis. western blot analysis was used to determine iNOS, COX-2, NF-B, and p-IB levels in colonic tissues. HMFO treatment drastically attenuated NF-B phosphorylation, which was. HMFO inhibited LPS-induced NO production by suppressing iNOS expression in RAW 264.7 macrophages. the iNOS gene is the primary regulator of NO production in macrophages. HMFO inhibited inflammatory mediators by suppressing iNOS. 4.7 macrophages were pretreated with different HMFO concentrations for 2 h. then stimulated with LPS (1 g/mL) for 22 h. iNOS and COX-2 protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. treatment with HMFO inhibited LPS-induced TNF- and IL-6 production in RAW 264.7 macrophages. mRNA levels of TNF- and IL-6 were upregulated by LPS stimulation. treatment with HMFO suppressed TNF- and IL-6 expression. tory effects of HMFO on NF-B activation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. we measured nuclear NF-B and cytoplasmic IKK / and IB / levels.

Inhibitory Effects of HMFO on NF-B activation in RAW 264.7 macrophages. HMFO may inhibit NF-B activation and NO production in RAW 264.7 macrophages by suppressing MAPK phosphorylation. HMFO inhibited expression of several cytokines and enzymes involved in inflammation. HMFO improved the signs of histological damage, such as shortened colon length, and significantly reduced serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines. HMFO inhibited iNOS and COX-2 protein expression and the levels of phosphorylated NF-B p65 in the colon tissue of mice with colitis."}
