{"summary": "dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP4i) is a membrane glycoprotein known for its role in catalytic degradation of incretins. it is a transmembrane glycoprotein that forms a homodimer or tetramer on the plasma membrane and cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from proteins with proline or alanine as the penultimate amino acids. extracellular component contains a /-hydrolase domain and an eight-blade -propeller domain. this domain is responsible for its dipeptidyl-peptidase activity and binding to proteins such as ADA and fibronectin. residues 340\u2013343 within the cysteine-rich segment have been shown to be essential for ADA binding. the regulation of DPP4 expression is not fully understood. studies suggest STAT1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 mediate the transcription of DPP4. IL-12 enhances the translation, but not transcription, of DPP4 in activated lymphocytes. the physiologic targets include GLP1, GLP2, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), peptide YY, stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and substance P (3\u201311). the catalytic activity of DPP4 has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. the catalytic activity of DPP4 has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. it will not be discussed here in detail. ion of CD45RO into lipid rafts suggests that DPP4 may transduce costimulation via CD45. this is consistent with the observation that CD4+ T cells lacking DPP4 cannot be triggered to elicit a memory T cell response. interaction of DPP4 with caveolin-1 may form a complex consisting of DOO4, CARMA1, Bcl10, MALT1 and IB kinase. the coexpression of DPP4 and CXCR5 may partially explain the association between DPP4 expression and HIV infection [40]. Upon binding to DPP4, caveolin-1 is phosphorylated, resulting in the phosphorylation of IRAK-1 and its disassociation with Tollip. the interaction between DPP4 and caveolin-1 has been reported to be involved in the pathogenesis of arthritis [45] studies have suggested that STAT1 and hepatocyte nuclear factor-1 mediate the transcription of DPP4. IL-12 enhances the translation, but not transcription, of DPP4 in activated lymphocytes. physiologic targets include GLP1, GLP2, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), peptide YY, stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), erythropoietin, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and substance P (3\u201311). ietin, IL-3, neuropeptide Y, natriuretic peptide Y, and peptide YY have been extensively reviewed elsewhere. the catalytic activity of DPP4 has been extensively reviewed elsewhere. DPP4-ADA interaction may also promote T cell activation by degrading adenosine, an immunosuppressive metabolite. interaction of DPP4 with caveolin-1 may form a complex consisting of DOO4, CARMA1, Bcl10, MALT1 and IB kinase in the lipid rafts on T cell membrane, leading to the activation of NF-B. DPP4/Caveolin-1-Mediated Immune Activation Ohnuma et al. reported that DPP4 interacts with caveolin-1 present on APCs and initiates a signaling cascade in antigen loaded APCs. caveolin-1 is phosphorylated, resulting in the phosphorylation of IRAK-1 and its disassociation with Tollip. interactions with these matrix components may play a role in sequestration of DPP4 and allow thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, and metformin have been reported to reduce circulating DPP4 [53\u201355] and DPP4 expression on T cells. this may reflect improvement in glycemic control and other measures of inflammation resulting in the reciprocal decrease in DPP4 expression. most clinical trials with DPP4i demonstrate a 0.6\u20130.8% lowering of HbA1C in patients with a baseline level around 8%. most common reported side effects include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and headache. PP4 may play a role in the development of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. interaction between DPP4 and adenosine deaminase (ADA) may also facilitate T cell activation. inherited mutations in ADA activity cause severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) in both human and mice. antigen presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, facilitated T cell proliferation and activation through its noncatalytic activity. these results suggest that DPP4 on antigen presenting cells is capable of promoting inflammation and insulin resistance through its noncatalytic function. thiazolidinedione, pioglitazone, and metformin have been reported to reduce circulating DPP4 [53\u201355] and DPP4 expression on T cells. this may reflect improvement in glycemic control and other measures of inflammation resulting in the reciprocal decrease in DPP4 expression. most clinical trials with DPP4i demonstrate a 0.6\u20130.8% lowering of HbA1C in patients with a baseline level around 8%. most common reported side effects include nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and headache. subpopulations expressing lowest levels of DPP4 [18] were suggested to be protective in the development of adipose inflammation and insulin resistance. interaction between DPP4 and adenosine deaminase (ADA) may also facilitate T cell activation by providing a suitable microenvironment for T cell proliferation. antigen presenting cells, including macrophages and dendritic cells, facilitated T cell proliferation and activation through its noncatalytic activity. adenovirus delivery of human DPP4 into mouse has been developed to study MERS-CoV infection. the activation of adenylate cyclase leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase through stimulatory Gs subunit. in cell, the activation of GLP-1 activates PKA, which subsequently reduces Foxo1 and results in an increase of Foxa2. there is evidence that GLP-1 signaling is involved in the cardioprotective effects of DPP4 inhibition. in vitro treatment of cardiomyocyte with GLP-1R agonist reduced caspase-3 cleavage and apoptosis induced by various stimulations such as TNF, hypoxia, and lipidemia [94\u201396] there have been conflicting observations of GLP-1 effect on myocardial contractility in primary cultured adult rat cardiomyocytes. infusion of exendin-4 for 4 weeks reduced neointimal formation, foam cell formation and atherosclerotic lesion size. some of these effects may relate to favorable effects of GLP-1 on lipoprotein metabolism. infusion of GLP-1 (20 pmol/kg/min) via jugular vein reduces triacylglycerol absorption. DPP4 inhibition relaxes aorta through a GLP-1-independent pathway. alogliptin induces eNOS and Akt phosphorylation paralleled by rapid increase in nitric oxide. alogliptin induces eNOS and Akt phosphorylation in response to alogliptin. cytokines including IL-2, IL-10, IL-12, and IFN- by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and T cells showed reduced activation compared to those transfected with wild-type DPP4. soluble DPP4 mutant without enzymatic activity did not, providing a direct evidence that enzymatic activity of DPP4 is involved in the T cell activation. pharmacologic inhibition with sitagliptin also enhances expression of cardioprotective proteins and improved functional recovery after I/R injury in the murine heart [1]. vildagliptin treatment has been shown to reduce blood pressure in the spontaneously hypertensive rat, an effect that was accompanied by an increase in aortic and glomerular NO release. human studies reveal contradictory results on the cardiovascular effects of DPP4 inhibitors. the association between DPP4 inhibition and increased risk of heart failure is also supported by another meta-analysis by monami in 2014. trials include EXAMINE (EXamination of cArdiovascular outcoMes with alogliptin versus standard of carE in patients with T2DM and acute coronary syndrome) on alogliptin and SAVOR-TIMI 53 (Saxagliptin Assessment of Vascular Outcomes recorded in patients with diabetes Mellitus-Thrombolysis in myocardial infarction 53 trial) 16492 subjects with a history of MI, atherosclerosis, hypertension, smoking, or dyslipidemia were recruited in SAVOR-TIMI 53. the patients were randomized to saxagliptin or placebo group. additional antidiabetic agents were prescribed throughout the study. vildagliptin improved left ventricular enlargement and dysfunction. increased left ventricular function assessed by ejection fraction, mitral annular systolic velocity, and peak systolic velocity. 84 trials and 69,615 patients reported that DPP4i increased the overall risk for heart failure with an OR of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.37; P = 0.015) saxagliptin did not increase the incidence rates for cardiovascular events including heart failure, with an incidence rate ratio of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.27 to 1.12) for heart failure. patients with increased risk for hospitalization for heart failure had either prior heart failure or elevated levels of natriuretic peptides or chronic kidney disease. however, the risks of the primary and secondary endpoints were similar between treatment groups even in patients at high risk for hospitalization for heart failure [148] this suggests that DPP4i does not increase death, myocardial infarction, or stroke even in those with increased risk for heart failure. subsequently reduces Foxo1 and results in an increase of Foxa2. a cAMP-dependent pathway, GLP-1R signaling may also induce the activation of PI3K which further increases the expression of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL, two antiapoptotic proteins. p38 MAPK activity, nitric oxide (NO) production, and GLUT1 expression in isolated hearts increased myocardial glucose uptake and left ventricular hemodynamics [98] there have been conflicting observations of GLP-1 effect on myocardial contractility. study suggests absence of GLP-1R increases baseline left ventricular developed pressure. infusion of GLP-1 (20 pmol/kg/min) via jugular vein reduces triacylglycerol absorption. exendin-4 (24 nmol/kg, i.p.) and sitagliptin (10 mg/kg, gavage) reduced postprandial triacylglycerol and ApoB-48 production in rats. inhibition of kinase decreased eNOS and Akt phosphorylation in response to alogliptin, suggesting that alogliptin mediates vasodilation through Src kinase mediated activation of the eNOS-Akt. DPP4 has also been shown to assist in angiogenesis by promoting EPCs in a GLP-1-independent pathway. transfected with mutant mutant DPP4 showed reduced activation compared to those transfected with wild-type DPP4. soluble DPP4 mutant without enzymatic activity did not, providing a direct evidence that enzymatic activity of DPP4 is involved in the T cell activation. 2 studies using flow mediated dilation of the brachial artery have shown diametrically opposite results. both GLP-1 agonism and DPP4 inhibition reduce postprandial triacylglycerol and ApoB-48 in rodents [111, 112] human studies reveal contradictory results on the cardiovascular effects of DPP4 inhibitors. the association between DPP4 inhibition and increased risk of heart failure is also supported by another meta-analysis by monami et al. liptin and SAVOR-TIMI 53 have been completed. 5,380 diabetic patients with a recent (90 days) myocardial infarction were randomized to the treatment of alogliptin or placebo. there was a trend towards reduction in cardiovascular death albeit nonstatistically significant. no improvements in cardiovascular outcomes were observed in saxagliptin-treated subjects. the hospitalization rate for heart failure was higher in saxagliptin-treated subjects. a longer follow-up period may be necessary to further confirm the results. vildagliptin ameliorated TAC-induced left ventricular enlargement and dysfunction. improved survival rate on day 28 (TAC with vildagliptin, 67.5%; TAC without vildagliptin, 41.5%; P 0.05) in, alogliptin, linagliptin, and dutogliptin increased the overall risk for heart failure with an OR of 1.19 (95% CI: 1.03 to 1.37; P = 0.015) saxagliptin did not increase the incidence rates for cardiovascular events including heart failure, with an incidence rate ratio of 0.55 (95% CI: 0.27 to 1.12) for heart failure. safety of DPP4i Early studies suggested a well tolerability of DPP4i with only some minor side effects such as gastrointestinal reaction (nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, etc.), flu-like symptoms, and skin reactions [63, 150, 151]. an altered expression level of DPP4 has been reported in many types of cancer compared with other therapies. monami et al. reported a significant increase in the risk of nasopharyngitis with sitagliptin. the actual incidence of other infections was lower than in comparator groups. however, there are very limited clinical data examining the risk of DPP4i on pancreatitis and the conclusion remains uncertain. at least one trial showed an increase of heart failure hospitalization in patients with prior heart failure or chronic kidney disease. the absolute risks for heart failure agents are small with these agents and it must be acknowledged that not only diabetes but other therapies used for glycemia control."}
