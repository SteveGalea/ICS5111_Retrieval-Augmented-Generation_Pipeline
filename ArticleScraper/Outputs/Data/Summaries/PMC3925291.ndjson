{"summary": "the aetiology of diarrhoea remains unexplained in a large proportion of HIV-1 infected patients. a search for unknown and unexpected viruses was performed using virus discovery cDNA-AFLP combined with Roche-454 sequencing (VIDISCA-454) the gastrointestinal tract is one of the most affected sites in untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected persons. in these patients diarrhoea occurs frequently, especially in HIV-1 patients who are not treated with anti-retroviral therapy. however, it has not been demonstrated that HIV-1 causes diarrhoea. human gyrovirus, a member of the Circoviridae, is the most unusual novel virus which is found in gastrointestinal infections [21]. it remains unclear whether human gyrovirus in stool is a sign of gastrointestinal infection or a virus which is digested with food and shed in feces, like many food related viruses [23] the definition of diarrhoea was loose or watery stool at least 3 times a day during the week prior to faeces collection. patients were asked for the occurrence of additional symptoms and use of medication that might affect the consistency of stool. cultures were performed less than 4 hours after the specimen was collected. blood transfusion 1% (1) 0% (0) 100% (1) HIV-1 SI phenotype 32% (62) 21% (13) 79% (49) P24 antigen in serum 16% (32) 3% (1) 97% (31) HIV-1 RNA load >4.9 10 4 copies/ml 51% (99) 19% (19) 81% (80) 1IQR = inter quartile range. acid-fast staining was performed for detection of Cryptosporidia and Isospora species. fresh stool specimens were plated on cystine lactose electrolyte-deficient medium. a cell-culture assay was used to detect Clostridium difficile toxin. dsDNA-amplified nucleic acid was quantified with the Quant-it dsDNA HS Qubit kit (Invitrogen) all separate fractions were pooled and 4 pools from 14 different samples were used for a titration. Sequence analysis Primer, MID and ribosomal RNA sequences were trimmed or removed from the reads. Statistical analysis to determine association with diarrhoea was performed with the mid-P exact test. Statistical analysis for the CD4 cell counts and the HIV-1 load was performed with the test of equality variance from OpenEpi [40]. IU penicillin per ml, 3 g amphotericin B per ml. suspensions were stored at 80\u00b0C until further use. PBMC were stained with CD4 mAb. Virus diagnostics DNA was extracted from 110 l stool suspensions by the Boom extraction method. RT-PCRs specific for rotavirus A and C, enterovirus, human parechovirus, norovirus genogroup I and II, astrovirus, sapovirus and adenovirus 40, 41 and 52 were performed. selective cefsulodin-irgasan-novobiocin medium and glucose broth enrichment medium were used to isolate Yersinia species. a cell-culture assay was used to detect Clostridium difficile toxin. VIDISCA and Roche Titanium-454 sequencing was performed on 110 l stool suspension. Sequences were assembled with CodonCode Aligner software version 3.5.6. the consensus sequences (contigs) and the unassembled reads were compared with the available sequences in Genbank [37] via the BlastN tool using default settings. the known diarrhoea agents parechovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus or adenovirus 40, 41 or 52 were not found in any of the 196 HIV-1 infected patients. the known pathogens parechovirus, astrovirus, rotavirus or adenovirus 40, 41 or 52 were not found in any of the 196 patients. five patients with diarrhoea (16.8%) were infected with bacteria. Salmonella n = 1, Mycobacterium n = 1 and Campylobacter n = 3. none of the bacterial infections were significantly associated with diarrhoea. a total of 56 stool samples, including samples that remained negative in diagnostics, were selected and investigated by VIDISCA-454. a total of 7,316 known viral sequences could be identified this way (2.7% of all sequences, see Table 3). torque teno viruses (TTV) and picobirnaviruses were found. these viruses differ substantially in their genome sequence and the size of their genome. a high amount of sequences of Cryptosporidium parvum-virus was found in a patient infected with the parasite. one novel virus was identified among the VIDISCA-454 reads. the virus was present in a high concentration in stool since large numbers of sequence reads belonged to the virus. the virus is exceptional because it displays no significant similarity to any of the viruses known thus far. cosavirus was found in 1 patient (3.4%) with and in 2 patients (1.2%) without diarrhoea. human gyrovirus was detected in 33 individuals (17%). 40 individuals (20%) were positive of whom 34 had no diarrhoea (20%) and 6 diarrhoea (21%). microscope analysis showed that 3 patients with diarrhoea (10%) and 1 patient without diarrhoea (0.6%) were infected with Cryptosporidium parvum. the virus infecting the parasite was found in 2 patients with diarrhoea (6.9%) and in 3 patients without diarrhoea (1.8%) and was not associated with diarrhoea. there was no difference in antibiotic usage in diarrhoea cases compared to control patients without diarrhoea (41% versus 49%). real time PCR, bacteria culture and microscopy was performed on stool samples of 196 HIV-1 infected patients of whom 29 had severe diarrhoea. 5 patients with diarrhoea (16.8%) were infected with bacteria: Salmonella n = 1, Mycobacterium n = 1 and Campylobacter n = 3. none of the bacterial infections were significantly associated with diarrhoea. 10 patients with diarrhoea (34%) remained without diagnosis. a total of 56 stool samples were selected and investigated by VIDISCA-454. a total of 7,316 known viral sequences could be identified this way. torque teno viruses (TTVs) and picobirnaviruses were found. a high amount of sequences of Cryptosporidium parvum-virus was found in a patient infected with Cryptosporidium parvum. the virus has been described in the 1980\u2019s in patients with non A non B hepatitis. the viral genomes consist of 5,005 (NANBH-1) and 5,687 (NANBH-2) bps. the virus is similar to the NANBH-1 except for a 687 nucleotide insertion in a non-coding region. one novel virus was identified among the VIDISCA-454 reads. all 196 patients - diarrhoea patients and subjects without diarrhoea - were tested for the above mentioned viruses. cosavirus was found in 1 patient (3.4%) with and in 2 patients (1.2%) without diarrhoea. gyrovirus was detected in 33 individuals (17%) and 4 diarrhoea patients (14%). virus infecting the parasite was found in 2 patients with diarrhoea (6.9%) and in 3 patients without diarrhoea (1.8%). only one sample was found positive in both assays. the role of HIV-1 itself in the unexplained diarrhoea was examined. in total 91 patients were treated with antibiotics, most with a combination of sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. there was no difference in antibiotic usage in diarrhoea cases compared to control patients without diarrhoea (41% versus 49%) a very sensitive nested PCR assay was used to detect the virus. to exclude that the high prevalence was caused by PCR contamination, all positive PCR products were sequenced. gyrovirus was detected in 33 patients in the Netherlands in 1994 and 1995. a study focusing on unexplained diarrhoea should include more HIV-1 positive patients with unexplained diarrhoea to be able to confirm our hypothesis that HIV-1 itself plays a role in gastrointestinal disorders. the novel IAS virus could not be linked to diarrhoea but interestingly, it was associated with advanced stages of HIV-1 disease. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
