{"summary": "a total of 75,594 individuals of 169 species of reptiles and amphibians were imported into Thailand in 1990\u20132007. the majority of individuals (59,895, 79%) were listed as captive-bred and a smaller number (15,699, 21%) as wild-caught. international wildlife trade is seen as one of the leading threats to biodiversity conservation [1]. it has been invoked as a vector for disease transmission to humans. it has led to the introduction of invasive species, threatening individual species and ecosystems. a series of checks-and-balances and analysis of CITES data are needed to increase the effectiveness of CITES and natural resource management. here we focus the live trade of species of amphibians and reptiles into Thailand presumably to supply the exotic pet market. this work was motivated by emerging evidence that commercial captive-breeding of herpetofauna in certain countries is fraught with problems. a total of 75,594 individuals of at least 169 species of amphibians and reptiles were imported into Thailand in the period 1990\u20132007. the majority of individuals (59,895, 79%) were listed as captive-bred and a smaller number (15,699, 21%) as wild-caught. in the 1990s relative small numbers of individuals of a few species were imported into Thailand, but in 2003 both volumes and species diversity increased rapidly for a few years only. in 2003 both volumes and species diversity increased rapidly for a few years only. the figure shows the numbers of live captive-bred reptiles and amphibians imported into Thailand for the period 1990\u20132007. the peak in the 1994\u20131997 is due to the import of large numbers of green iguana Iguana from Colombia and El Salvador. the import of live reptiles into Thailand via Macao is restricted to the year 2006 when 102 individuals of 9 species were re-exported from Macao. the increase in captive-bred specimens may suggest a switch from wild-caught to captive-bred specimens. in some years 80% or more of the individuals are captive-bred, whereas in other years all are wild-caught. there are large discrepancies in volumes exported and imported. a total of 5441 individuals of 27 species listed as globally threatened were imported into Thailand in the period 1998\u20132007. most originated from Madagascar (1906 individuals of 7 species) and mali (100 wild and 108 captive-bred African spurred tortoises) captive-bred specimens mainly originated from the united states (100 wild and 108 captive-bred African spurred tortoises) mantella expectata (2008) 385 Madagascar Mantella viridis (2008) 256 Madagascar Mantella bernhardi (2008) 100 Madagascar Epipedobates tricolor (2004) 100 Lebanon Phyllobates terribilis (2008) 100 Ukraine Cryptophyllobates [Hyloxalus] azureiventris (2004) 40 Lebanon Indotestudo forstenii (2000; 1996 VU) 20 Indonesia Vulnerable Mantella madagascariensis (2008) 383 Madagascar Man there may be discrepancies between source codes, e.g. wild-caught and captive-bred, and unaccounted imports/exports. these inaccuracies undermine the credibility of CITES and lowers the confidence that allowable trade is biologically sustainable. the bulk of the captive-bred specimens imported into Thailand are Kazakhstan and Lebanon. Kazakhstan joined CITES in 2000 and only has to report on trade in CITES listed species from 2000 onwards. a significant and open trade in exotic reptiles and amphibians in Thailand. the borders with neighbouring Myanmar, Laos and Cambodia can be porous. the region functions as a very important transit country for exotic species to especially Asian destinations. international entry and exit should be more vigilant to prevent large quantities of especially CITES I-listed species from being traded in Thailand. we urge the CITES Management Authorities of Thailand, as well as the CITES Secretariat, to investigate the trade in wildlife from non-CITES Parties (Lebanon and Macao) data on the conservation status of species was retrieved from the IUCN Red List website. we focussed on species that are Critically Endangered, Endangered or Vulnerable."}
