{"summary": "EVD is transmitted between humans through contact with blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected or dead humans or animals. symptoms are vomiting, diarrhea, body rash, tremors and in some cases, both internal and external bleeding. the largest outbreak so far started in Guinea in December 2013. the earliest mathematical models for EVD appeared long before the 2014\u201315 epidemic. the model was used to study the 2014\u201315 outbreaks by rivers et al. Tsanou et al. considered the role of host-reservoir transmission (with bats as reservoir) of EVD and spillover potential to humans. a number of mathematical models have been designed and used to gain insight into population-level impact of quarantine and isolation on the spread and control of infectious diseases. Hethcote presented SIQS (susceptible-infected-quarantined-susceptible) and SIQR (susceptible-infected-quarantined-recovered) models for the dynamics of an infectious disease that is controllable using quarantine and isolation. a probabilistic model was designed and used by day et al. to determine the conditions under which quarantine is expected to be useful. quarantine is temporary removal of susceptible individuals who are feared to have been exposed to a communicable disease. if they have acquired the infection, they are then placed in isolation. people can be quarantined at home (i.e., self-quarantine) or in public health facility. the models in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010) assume perfect quarantine. the aim of the current study is to design a new model for realistically assessing the population-level impact of quarantine. the total population of individuals not in quarantine at time t is sub-divided into sub-populations of susceptible ( S U ( t) ), exposed ( E U ( t ), symptomatic ( I U ( t ), treated ( I T ( t ), recovered ( R ( t ) ), dead ( D ( t ). a fraction, q, of susceptible individuals who are feared exposed to Ebola are placed in do not develop the disease at the end of the quarantine period are moved to the S U class at a rate r Q. do not develop the disease at the end of the quarantine period are moved to the S U class at a rate r Q. d I U ( t ), I \u2032 ( t ) = w ( I U ( t ) + I Q ( t ) d I Q ( t ), I Q \u2032 ( t ) = p E Q ( t ) ( v + m + w ) d I Q ( t ) d I Q ( t ), R \u2032 ( t ) = v ( I U ( t ) + Fitted r Q Rate of release from quarantine 1.107 (0.5\u20132)/week Fitted k Q Q Average per capita contact rate during quarantine 7.97/week Fitted 1 / p Incubation period 1.498 week (Gomes et al., 2014; Legrand et al., 2007) w Hospitalization rate 1.58/week (Gomes et al., 2014; Legrand et al., 2007; Pandey et al., 2007 infectious individuals in the I U and I Q classes are hospitalized at a rate w. the parameters v and m are, respectively, the recovery rate and per capita disease-induced death rate. the models in (Lipsitch et al., 2003; Mubayi et al., 2010) assume susceptible individuals in quarantine do not acquire infection during quarantine. this allows for the heterogeneity between infected individuals in quarantine and isolation and those not in quarantine and isolation. lemma 2.1 Suppose that the initial values S U ( 0 ), S Q ( 0 ), E U ( 0 ), E Q ( 0 ), I U ( 0 ), I T ( 0 ), I Q ( 0 ), R ( 0 ), D ( 0 ), B ( 0 ) of the model (2) are all nonnegative. the proof for the nonnegativity component of the theorem is by contradiction. lemma 2.2 The region is positively-invariant for the model (2) for every nonnegative initial condition in R + 9. 2.2. good estimates for pretty much all the non-quarantine related parameters of the model (2) are available in the literature. k Q Q, r Q and q are four quarantine-related parameters available. we fitted the model using the available cumulative data for the 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreaks in three affected west africa countries. y i and y i are the exact and estimated cumulative number of cases for week i ( i = 1,2,, 40 ). the relative error (0.8134) confirms the goodness of the fit obtained. lemma 2.1 Suppose that the initial values S U ( 0 ), S Q ( 0 ), E Q ( 0 ), I U ( 0 ), I Q ( 0 ), I Q ( 0 ), I T ( 0 ), R ( 0 ), D ( 0 ), B ( 0 ) of the model (2) are all nonnegative. the proof for the nonnegativity component of the theorem is by contradiction. lemma 2.2 The region is positively-invariant for the model (2) for every nonnegative initial condition in R + 9. 2.2. good estimates for one of the four quarantine-related parameters ( Q ) are available. the model was fitted using the available cumulative data for the 2014\u201315 Ebola outbreaks in three affected west africa countries. in order to do so, we applied Latin Hypercube Sampling (a Monte-Carlo sampling method) to generate a representative sample set from the parameters for the three quarantine-related parameters ( k Q Q, r Q and q), while the baseline values for the rest of the parameters, given in Table 1, are used.

follows. the other cases can be handled in a similar way. of R 0 lies in the range given in numerous modeling studies for the 2014 EVD outbreaks. analysis of full model with quarantine and standard incidence. local asymptotic stability of the DFE of the full model (2). the model (2) can be shown to undergo the phenomenon of backward bifurcation at R 0 Q = 1. a dynamic phenomenon associated with the co-existence of stable disease-free equilibrium and a stable endemic equilibrium when the associated reproduction threshold, R 0 Q, is less than unity. the epidemiological implication of this phenomenon is that having R 0 Q 1, while necessary, is no longer sufficient for the effective control of the disease. this level (and effectiveness) of quarantine is unable to lead to the effective control of the disease (since R 0 Q > 1, albeit only slightly) if the parameter Q, for the reduction of infectiousness of quarantined-infected individuals, is further reduced from its baseline value. the average contact rate in the community ( k) and probability of transmission per contact (b) are the most dominant parameters that affect the response function (the cumulative number of cases) the mean length of time for the burial of Ebola-deceased individuals ( 1 / f ) is also shown to be influential. k Q Q Average per capita contact rate during quarantine 0.19 1 / p Incubation period 0.22 v Recovery rate 0.08 m Ebola-induced death rate 0.39 w Hospitalization rate 0.24 1 / f Mean time from death due to Ebola to burial 0.43 4.1. uncertainties are expected to arise in the estimates of the parameter values used in the model simulations. 0.4, for example, leads to a reduction of mean R 0 Q from R 0 Q = 1.009 to R 0 Q = 0.997. these simulations show that the singular implementation of quarantine strategy in the community can lead to the effective control (or elimination) of the disease if the coverage (q) and effectiveness of quarantine to prevent transmission during quarantine (i.e. reduce Q ) is high enough. a quarantine program that significantly decreases the value of Q Q or increase q can lead to a significant reduction in disease burden. this study suggests that a quarantine program that significantly decreases the value of Q Q or increase q (by increasing the contact tracing and quarantining of people feared exposed to EVD infection) can lead to a significant reduction in disease burden. a contour plot of the quarantine reproduction number ( R 0 Q ) is depicted in Fig. 9, from which it follows that R 0 Q decreases with decreasing values of Q and increasing values of q. this plot further supports the earlier result that the implementation of a quarantine strategy that reduces the infectiousness of quarantined-infected individuals will result in significant reduction of disease burden in the community. a new deterministic model for assessing the population-level impact of the implementation of quarantine on the control of the 2014 Ebola outbreaks in west africa. the model was fitted using data relevant to the EVD dynamics in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone. the full model with quarantine was analysed, from which it was deduced that adding imperfect quarantine to the quarantine-free model introduces a dynamic phenomenon (backward bifurcation) the presence of backward bifurcation in the transmission dynamics of a disease makes its effective control more difficult (since a lot more effort is needed to reduce the associated reproduction number further below unity) control measures that decrease the impact of these parameters will be quite effective in minimizing disease burden. our results suggest that the quarantine of susceptible individuals and the average duration in quarantine have a smaller effect on the number of infected, the modified transmission rate during quarantine and the contact rate for quarantined people have an important effect on the spread of the disease."}
