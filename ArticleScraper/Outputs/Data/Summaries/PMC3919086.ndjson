{"summary": "enteric diseases tend to predominantly affect young birds; however, the disease may occur in all age groups, which increases susceptibility to other diseases, decreases feed conversion efficiency, and prolongs the time to market. at present, no specific treatment exists, and commercially available vaccines have not yet been developed for any of the viruses that are involved in this disease. enteric diseases seem to be the most acceptable name for this clinical manifestation because it most appropriately reflects the consistency of the clinical findings. we screened seven related viruses as potential agents of enteric disease in chickens to investigate the highest number of agents. supernatants were stored at 20\u00b0C until analysis. DNA and RNA were extracted from supernatants using TRIzol. reference Viruses ChPV, adenovirus, CAstV, and ANV strains used as positive controls. DNA Virus Detection Conventional PCR was conducted to detect chicken parvovirus and fowl adenovirus of subgroup 1. amplifications were performed in a biometra DNA thermocycler (Biometra GmbH, Goettingen, Germany) the size of the amplified product was estimated using the 100 base pair DNA Ladder molecular size marker (Invitrogen) RNA Virus Detection RNA isolated from field samples was in vitro transcribed and amplified using the one-Step RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) each sample was composed of a pool of intestinal contents obtained from five chickens of whole intestine, from duodenum to the end of ileum. the age of the chickens varied from three days old to 106 weeks old broilers, broiler breeders, pullet, and layer hen flocks. samples were preserved at 20\u00b0C until shipment to the laboratory of Avian Diseases (Sao Paulo, SP, Brazil) otide sequences, amplicons, and corresponding references were used to screen for the viruses. DNA Virus Detection was conducted to detect chicken parvovirus and fowl adenovirus of subgroup 1, as previously described. primers, 5 L of 5 buffer, 0.2 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) mix, 1.25 mM MgCl2 and 1 U of Platinum DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen) the negative control included sterile water. PCRs ended with a final extension step of 10 min at 72\u00b0C. to detect IBV, the primers and reaction conditions described by Day et al. [20] were used to amplify a 179 bp fragment from the 3\u2032untranslated region. results At least one virus was detected in 226 (80.7%) of the 280 examined samples. 183 (65.4%) were positive for one or more of the screened viruses. IBV 39 (13.9) 6 (2.1) 45 (16.1) ANV 18 (6.4) 4 (1.4) 22 (7.9) CAstV 10 (3.6) 4 (1.4) 14 (5.0) Parvovirus 5 (1.8) 0 (0.0) 5 (1.8) Adenovirus 12 (4.3) 2 (0.7) 14 (5.0) Rotavirus 6 (2.1) 4 (1.4) 10 (3.6) Reovirus 1 (0.4) 0 (0.0) 1 (0.4) Total one virus 91 (3 the majority of positive samples were detected in broiler chickens 193 (85.4%) during the first seven weeks of age. the lowest detection of enteric viruses was present in pullet and layer hens with 4.9%, both types of birds with a homogeneous distribution among the weeks. enterotropic strains of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) have been considered the primary etiological agents of gastroenteritis in commercial poultry. however, many viral infections have been associated with enteric diseases of chickens and turkeys. infections with the previously mentioned viruses are believed to be important in the pathogenesis of the economically important enteric disease. samples taken from chickens without symptoms (15.4%) were also positive for these viruses. this result indicates that chickens should be shedding the virus via the enteric tract without showing any clinical symptoms. however, these studies did not survey a wide range of viruses. the distribution of the seven viruses in these concomitance samples was demonstrated. none particular combination of the viruses was observed with significant repeatability. IBV was the most prevalent virus detected in the samples that contained a single virus. ANV was detected in 83 samples (29.6%), as shown in Table 3. it is the most prevalent pathogen causing enteric disease. rotaviruses are associated with acute gastroenteritis in humans, cattle, swine, sheep, cats, dogs, deer, mice, and turkeys. studies on the classification of serogroups by PAGE have indicated that group D rotaviruses are the most frequently reported group in United Kingdom flocks [42] rotavirus infection has recently been implicated as a contributing factor to the development of RSS in 5- to 14-day-old broilers in Germany. a high prevalence of chicken parvovirus (77%) was detected in 54 chicken samples. the subgroup I and II adenoviruses are considered widely distributed in poultry. the role of most subgroup I avian adenoviruses as pathogens is not well defined. the role of avian reoviruses in enteric disease remains unclear. the association between viruses and age showed that the viruses could be detected at different stages in the broilers, breeders, and pullet/layer hens. an important finding was the detection of CAstV in one-day-old breeder chicks. this is the first study to demonstrate the presence of these viruses in association with enteric disease in Brazil. this is the first study to demonstrate the presence of these viruses in association with enteric disease in Brazil."}
