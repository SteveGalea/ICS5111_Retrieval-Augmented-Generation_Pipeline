{"summary": "culture of appropriate specimens on a combination of relevant media or cell lines enables detection of common bacterial, viral, and fungal pathogens. culture requires experienced personnel, requires several days to weeks to yield a definitive answer, depends on viability and appropriate culture conditions, and has limited sensitivity. next-generation sequencing-based metagenomic testing combines and extends many advantages of molecular tests and culture-based methods. metagenomics-based testing enables genotyping, assessment of molecular markers for drug resistance, and molecular epidemiologic studies. compared results to those of an FDA-cleared, multiplex PCR-based test, the GenMark eSensor respiratory virus panel (RVP). all nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from children less than 5 years old tested by the GenMark eSensor respiratory virus panel were deidentified using standard institutional procedures. 67 samples were selected at random for inclusion in a direct side-by-side comparison. RNA-seq libraries were prepared with the TruSeq RNA sample prep kit. libraries were quantified with the Illumina universal library quantification kit. taxonomer classifies each read to the highest taxonomic rank possible given a comprehensive sequence database. sequencing reads from virus-positive samples with low read counts were aligned to the viral consensus sequence of samples with high read counts processed in the same batch and sequenced on the same HiSeq lane. sequencing reads from samples with low read counts showed no polymorphisms compared to consensus sequence from samples with high read counts. untargeted metagenomics identified 36 of 42 (86%) respiratory viruses detected by the RVP. four of the 6 viruses missed by untargeted metagenomics could not be detected by qPCR. qPCR detection of enterovirus, HMPV, HRV, influenza A and B viruses, and RSV was performed using the Rotor-Gene multiplex RT-PCR master mix (Qiagen) on a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) with the following amplification conditions: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s, 56\u00b0C for 20 s, and 76\u00b0C for 30 nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs from children less than 5 years old tested by the GenMark eSensor respiratory virus panel between April 2013 and March 2014 were deidentified using standard institutional procedures. 67 samples were selected at random for inclusion in a direct side-by-side comparison. RNA-seq libraries were prepared with the TruSeq RNA sample prep kit. libraries were quantified with the Illumina universal library quantification kit. taxonomer classifies each read to the highest taxonomic rank possible. sequencing reads from virus-positive samples with low read counts were aligned to the viral consensus sequence of samples with high read counts processed in the same batch and sequenced on the same hiSeq lane. sequencing reads were aligned to the viral consensus sequence of samples with high read counts processed in the same batch. untargeted metagenomics identified 36 of 42 (86%) respiratory viruses detected by the RVP. four of the 6 viruses missed by untargeted metagenomics (blue bars) could not be detected by qPCR (hashed bars), resulting in 36 of 38 viruses that were consistently detected by targeted methods. qPCR detection of enterovirus, HMPV, HRV, influenza A and B viruses, and RSV was performed using the Rotor-Gene multiplex RT-PCR master mix (Qiagen) on a Rotor-Gene Q (Qiagen) with the following amplification conditions: 50\u00b0C for 30 min, 95\u00b0C for 5 min, and 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s, and 76\u00b0C for 30 nasopharyngeal swabs (n = 42) positive for one or more respiratory viruses by the RVP were retrospectively selected. agreement between RNA viruses detected by the RVP and untargeted metagenomics was 86%. six respiratory viruses detected by the RVP were not detected by untargeted metagenomics. untargeted metagenomics detected 12 additional respiratory viruses. 7 of the 12 additional viruses (58.3%) were confirmed by qPCR. 3 were qPCR negative, and 2 could not be tested due to limited sample volumes. number of viral reads in 68 positive samples spanned >5 orders of magnitude. correlation of RPKM and viral copies per milliliter was highly significant. only reads identified as viral (red, median 1:104 reads) were used for this analysis. correlation between viral copies per milliliter of viral transport medium determined by qPCR and normalized viral reads was assessed by a Spearman correlation test. three samples at different positivity levels by untargeted metagenomics were selected to evaluate within-run and between-run variability. two of the viruses were also detected by the RVP. a total of 5 (HRV and HMPV) or 14 (HCoV) times. libraries were sequenced on the same (within run) and on different (between-run) hiSeq lanes. untargeted metagenomics demonstrated excellent reproducibility. the most divergent sample from any full-length sequence in the NCBI nucleotide database was sample I. the one enterovirus sequence was most similar to coxsackievirus B4 strain E2 (NCBI accession number AF311939; 84% overall nucleotide identity) virus B (HRV-B14) and representative full-length genome sequences from each of the rhinovirus C lineages were included for comparison. Poliovirus 1 was used as the outgroup. colors represent species- and lineage-level clades. Detection of RNA from DNA viruses. agreement between RNA viruses detected by the RVP and untargeted metagenomics was 86%. six respiratory viruses detected by the RVP were not detected by untargeted metagenomics (blue bars) four of these were also not detected by qPCR. 7 of the 12 additional viruses (58.3%) were confirmed by qPCR. 3 were qPCR negative, and 2 could not be tested due to limited sample volumes. qPCR compared viral read counts with normalized viral reads counts. RPKM (reads per kilobase of reference sequence per million total sequencing reads) value. median of 0.01% was of viral origin. number of viral reads spanned >5 orders of magnitude. correlation of RPKM and viral copies per milliliter was highly significant. three samples at different positivity levels by untargeted metagenomics were selected to evaluate within-run and between-run variability. two of the viruses were also detected by the RVP; the third was a sample positive by qPCR for coronavirus. untargeted metagenomics showed excellent reproducibility, with coefficients of variation of 65% (HMPV, lowest fractional abundance), 16% (HCoV), and 47% (HRV, greatest fractional abundance). viral reads were a very small proportion of the total reads, but sufficient sequence was obtained for 84% of positive specimens. the most divergent sample from any full-length sequence in the NCBI nucleotide database was sample I, which had only 75% sequence identity with the closest match, HRV-C3 (strain HRV-QPM; GenBank accession no. GQ223228). the one enterovirus sequence was most similar to coxsackievirus B4 strain E2 (NCBI accession number AF311939; 84% overall nucleotide identity). untargeted metagenomics was able to detect only 1 of 2 adenovirus-positive samples. human bocavirus RNA was detected at high read counts in four samples. no respiratory viruses or known human-pathogenic viruses were detected. sensitivity of untargeted metagenomics is a function of sample composition and sequencing depth. sensitivity of untargeted metagenomics is a function of sample composition and sequencing depth. the confidence of viral detection depends on the number of viral reads and evenness of coverage. the confidence of viral detection depends on the number of viral reads and evenness of coverage. all influenza A viruses were 2009 H1N1 strains, but none contained the H275Y mutation conferring oseltamivir resistance. gent strain missed by the RVP, but none contained the H275Y mutation conferring oseltamivir resistance. strain-specific differences in pathogenicity have been suggested. RNA-seq reagent costs per sample were within $10 to $20 of reagent costs for RVP. cost is a great concern regarding the use of next-generation sequencing in infectious disease diagnostics. metagenomics-based detection of respiratory viruses holds promise as a diagnostics tool enabling unbiased pathogen detection, molecular tying, and genotypic assessment of drug resistance or pathogenicity. unbiased nature of metagenomics can also assist with detection of novel viruses or variant strains."}
