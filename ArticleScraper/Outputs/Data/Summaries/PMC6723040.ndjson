{"summary": "pulmonary histology differs substantially depending on anatomical location and specific tissue function. upper airways are ciliated, pseudostratified and contain multiple cell types with varying roles in the differentiated tissue. ciliated cells are responsible for cleaning out both mucus and debris [2], while basal cells serve as resident progenitor cells. hAEC cultures serve as a universal platform for the study and propagation of human respiratory viruses. transgenesis would enable the study of viral and/or host factors important for respiratory virus infections and allow for the elucidation of specific mechanism involved in virus\u2013host interactions. lentivirus modification of well-differentiated hAEC cultures has been described [23,24,25] thus far there have been no reports describing whether lentivirus modification of well-differentiated hAEC cultures alters the host innate immune response. we adapted our current cell culture protocol to generate genetically modified well-differentiated hAEC cultures with uniform transgene distribution. monolayer cultures of primary tracheobronchial epithelial cells were cultured on collagen-coated flasks in complete bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM) tracheobronchial epithelial cells were seeded in beGM with or without 10 M Y-27635 onto Collagen type IV coated 24-well HTS plates. one day later the apical side medium was aspirated, establishing ALI. isopropyl -D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)-inducible lentiviral backbone pLKO-puro-IPTG_3xLacO harboring the non-mammalian shRNA control was purchased. shRNA sequences TRCN0000231750 (5\u2032-CAACAGCCACAACGTCTATAT-3\u2032; targeting GFP CDS) for knockdown of GFP were extracted from the RNAi consortium website a total of 2.4 g transfer vector, 1.6 g pMDL, 0.6 g pRev and 0.8 g pVSV-g was transfected into the cells using lipofectamine 2000\u00ae. twenty-four hours post-transfection, the medium was replaced with BEGM and incubated for an additional 24\u201348 h before lentivirus-containing supernatant was collected on ice and spun down for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Flow Cytometry Cells were trypsinized with 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA (Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; Gibco); resuspended and fixed with 1 mL 4% buffered formalin. cells were stained with antibodies against tubulin. cells were sorted from HBSS supplemented with 10 M Y-27632 and 0.1% Pluronic (Sigma Aldrich) into BEGM supplemented with 10 M Y-27632. medium was changed to complete BEGM supplemented with 10 M Y-27632. cells were then expanded to larger culture flasks.

Lohmann) were cultured at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified incubator with 5% CO2. primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were cultured on collagen-coated flasks in complete bronchial epithelial growth medium (BEGM), supplemented with 100 g/mL Streptomycin, 100 IU/mL Penicillin, and with or without 10 M Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor (Y-27632, Abcam, Cambridge, United Kingdom) tracheobronchial epithelial cells were seeded shRNA oligos were annealed in cutSmart buffer by incubation of the sense and antisense strands at 94 \u00b0C for 10 min and slow cooling to room temperature. shRNA sequences TRCN0000231750 (5\u2032-CAACAGCCACAACGTCTATAT-3\u2032; targeting GFP CDS) for knockdown of GFP were extracted from the RNAi consortium website. Lentiviral Particle Production Low passage 293LTV cells were seeded in 2.2 mL of culture medium in a T25 cell culture flask (TPP, Trasadingen, Switzerland) a total of 2.4 g transfer vector, 1.6 g pMDL, 0.6 g pRev and 0.8 g pVSV-g was transfected into the cells using Lipofectamine 2000\u00ae. monolayer culture in 4 mL total medium with lentiviral supernatant for 24 h. cells were incubated accordingly to account for any experimental effects. once confluent, cells were expanded into T75 flasks (TPP) transduced cells were sorted for single positive mCherry signal or double positive mCherry/GFP signal at 4 \u00b0C using FACS Aria III and the corresponding FACS Diva software. cells were resuspended in complete BEGM supplemented with 10 M Y-27632, amphotericin B and gentamicin. images were acquired on a Nikon confocal microscope A1 (Nikon GmbH, Egg, Switzerland) combined with an ECLIPSE Ti inverted microscope using a Plan Apo 60/1.40 oil objective. cell viability was assessed with Alamar Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) inoculum was removed, and the apical surface washed three times with HBSS. cells were incubated for 72 h with progeny virus collection every 24 h. progeny virus collections were stored 1:1 in virus transport medium (VTM) quantification of progeny virus in apical washes from HCoV-229E and hRSV-infected hAEC cultures was performed using the NucleoMag VET. two microliters of extracted RNA was amplified using the TaqManTM Fast Virus 1-Step Master Mix. well-differentiated hAEC cultures cannot be efficiently transduced. we assessed the optimal duration and method of transduction of human bronchial cells in their undifferentiated state. lentiviral particles harboring the GFP-modified pLKO backbone containing a non-mammalian shRNA control. lentiviral transduction does not interfere with differentiation potential of primary human bronchial cells. transgene expression (GFP) can still be observed 6 weeks post-differentiation using a fluorescent microscope. ve controls and GFP transgene expression can be observed in all cellular subgroups after 6 weeks of differentiation. treatment of primary tracheobronchial cells with a commercially available ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, has been shown to induce a basal epithelial cell phenotype. hAEC cultures from treated and non-treated cells showed the same cellular composition as non-treated cells up to passage (p) 4. treatment of primary human tracheobronchial epithelial cells with a Rho-associated protein kinase inhibitor induces a basal cell phenotype and prolongs culture time. hAEC cultures treated with 10 M Y-27632 retain a basal cell phenotype. data is shown as mean of two technical replicates from two individual biological donors. treatment of primary tracheobronchial cells with Y-27632 results in slightly lower transduction efficacies. treatment of primary human bronchial cells with Y-27632 induces a prolonged basal cell phenotype in our primary human bronchial cells. this will accommodate the additional passages required for cellular expansion post-lentiviral transduction and cell sorting. however, constitutive knockdown of certain genes could interfere with differentiation resulting in unusable hAEC cultures post-transduction. tracheobronchial cells were transduced using the previously established suspension transduction protocol. the mCherry-positive cells were then further expanded prior to the establishment of homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures. comparison of nave and transgenic hAEC cultures revealed the same morphology. a representative maximum intensity Z-stack projection of two individual biological donor is displayed. a representative maximum intensity Z-stack projection of two individual biological donor is displayed. a representative maximum intensity Z-stack projection of two individual biological donor is displayed. the knockdown of GFP in Huh7 cells upon induction with IPTG demonstrates the functionality of different shRNA constructs in our modified inducible pLKO_mCherry_3xLacO lentiviral vector. confocal microscopy showed homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures expressing both mCherry and GFP, as well as the characteristic pattern of the tight-junction marker ZO-1. overall the GFP expression in shGFP1 cultures was distinctly weaker compared to shSCR and shGFP2. the cultures were immunostained with antibodies to visualize the mCherry (yellow), GFP (green) and tight junction borders (ZO-1, red) and counterstained with DAPI to visualize the nuclei (blue) a representative maximum intensity Z-stack projection from two individual biological donors is displayed. transgenesis of primary hAEC cultures does not affect host innate immune response or viral replication. hAEC cultures were stimulated for an additional 24 h with exogenous poly(I:C) after which the fold change in MxA mRNA expression was assessed via qPCR. both nave and homogenously transgenic hAEC cultures were pre-treated with 0 or 2 mM IPTG for 6 days prior to inoculation with 10,000 PFU of HCoV-229E-GFP. however, we did not observe any specific reduction in replication in those cultures in which GFP-directed shRNA had been induced by IPTG. the lack of knockdown is due to an insufficient amount of available shRNA within infected cells to negatively influence viral GFP mRNA expression. intact cultures are refractory to both apical and basolateral transduction while damaged cultures can be transduced from the apical side when the basolateral side of the epithelium is exposed. lentivirus containing supernatant was incubated in suspension for 4 h. lentiviral supernatant was seeded in T25 culture flasks in 4 mL total BEGM. medium was changed after 24 h, bringing the total lentiviral incubation time to 28 h. a new tab Transduction of primary airway epithelial cells does not alter cellular composition and differentiation. the cellular composition of transgenic cultures does not differ from nave controls. a representative fluorescent microscopy image of GFP expression levels (green) among nave and transgenic hAEC cultures 6 weeks post-differentiation. transgenic tracheobronchial cells cannot be seeded in LLI before monolayer passage three. treatment of both bronchial and cervical epithelial cells with a commercially available ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, has been shown to induce a basal epithelial cell phenotype. treatment of both bronchial and cervical epithelial cells with a commercially available ROCK inhibitor, Y-27632, has been shown to induce a bas hAEC cultures from both treated and non-treated cells were stained for nuclei (DAPI), cilia (-tubulin) and tight junctions (ZO-1) in low passage (p2) the two groups share the same structure and morphology. however, only Y-27632 treated cells, independent of donor, were able to maintain epithelial integrity post-differentiation. monolayer hAEC cultures treated with 10 M of Y-27632 can be transduced to similar levels as non-treated hAEC culture. data is shown as mean of two technical replicates for each individual biological donor. we assessed whether Y-27632 treated cells could be transduced to similar levels as nave cells. to circumvent these limitations, we aimed to establish an inducible lentiviral system for gene knockdown in hAEC cultures. to this end, we modified the inducible shRNA expression lentiviral vector pLKO_Puro_IPTG_3xLacO to express constitutively the mCherry fluorescence gene. this allows for cell sorting and microscopic evaluation of cells transduced with this shRNA cassette. transduction and FACS sorting of undifferentiated primary bronchial cells does not deplete any cell population from the differentiated cultures. this confirms our previous hypothesis that transduction and FACS sorting of undifferentiated primary bronchial cells does not deplete any cell population from the differentiated cultures. pLKO_GFP and pLKO_mCherry_3xLacO treated double positive cells with 1 mM IPTG for 72 h. reduction in number of GFP-positive cells does not exceed 30% for either GFP-specific shRNA. a representative microscopic image displaying the GFP expression of Huh-7 cells harboring either the shGFP1 and shGFP2 construct after 72 h of treatment with 0 or 2 mM IPTG. results are shown as means and standard deviation (SD) from duplicate experiments. hAEC cultures post-differentiation via inducible shRNA-mediated knockdown. individual shRNA constructs intended for modulation of gene expression in hAEC cultures require careful evaluation and testing. ourinic:polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) is a synthetic analogue of double stranded RNA (dsRNA), a molecular pattern associated with viral infection. the subsequent signaling cascade initiates the production of interferon that leads to the induction of several hundred interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) data is shown as mean and SD from duplicates from two individual biological donors. 0 and 2 mM IPTG-treated nave and homogenous transgenic hAEC cultures were inoculated with 10,000 PFU of HCoV-229E-GFP or hRSV-B-GFP and incubated at 33 \u00b0C. hRSV-GFP predominantly infects non-ciliated cells [13]. no difference in viral kinetics between nave and transgenic hAEC cultures was observed after infection with hRSV-GFP. this suggests that neither HCoV-229E-GFP nor hRSV-GFP are susceptible to shRNA-mediated knockdown. induction and prolongation of a basal cell phenotype in primary cells without gross influence on cell-differentiation capacity. by incorporating Y-27632 during the cell propagation phase, we could reproducibly achieve a transduction efficacy between 30%\u201370% in undifferentiated bronchial cells. this allowed us to incorporate a constitutive fluorescent reporter gene into the host cell genome that facilitates fluorescence-activated cell sorting. an inducible lentiviral system is operational post-differentiation. lentiviral-mediated transduction can be achieved with the currently established protocol. this is further corroborated by the uniform reduction of GFP expression by shGFP1 in transgenic hAEC cultures. the viral nucleoprotein of HCoV-229E counteracts RNA silencing [48], rendering our shRNA ineffective against these viruses. further characterization and validation of this phenomenon is fascinating but beyond the scope of this study."}
