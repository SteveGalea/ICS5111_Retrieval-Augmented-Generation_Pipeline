{"summary": "a 14-year-old killer whale died suddenly without notable premonitory signs. mild multifocal meningeal hyperemia and petechial parenchymal hemorrhage were noted in the right cerebrum and cerebellum. both lung lobes were mildly and diffusely heavy and wet. gastric ulcerations were present in the first gastric chamber and were chronic and active. they were characterized by central ulcerations with necrosis and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate surrounded by variable fibrosis and a rim of epithelial hyperplasia. the immunohistochemical stain was a commercial rabbit polyclonal antibody with peroxidase-tagged goat antirabbit immunoglobulin G (DakoCytomation, Carpinteria, CA, USA) bridge and 3-amino-9-ethylcarbazole as the chromogen. this staining demonstrated abundant WNV antigen within the cytoplasm of a small number of neurons and glial cells and in fewer macrophages in all 6 animals from Texas had 90% plaque-reduction titers >10, ranging from 40 to 80. the 5 whales housed together in Orlando had no measurable titer. findings broaden the known host tropism of WNV to include cetaceans. ans should consider using panviral microarray-based diagnostics. potential viral shedding can occur through the oropharygeal cavity and feces."}
