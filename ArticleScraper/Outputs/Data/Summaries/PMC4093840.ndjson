{"summary": "sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) gene expression conforms to the eukaryotic paradigm of cap-dependent translation of a single protein per mRNA. the sole viral protein expressed exclusively from a functionally polycistronic mRNA is the ORF36 protein kinase, a viral factor that activates the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and sensitizes KSHV- each transcript and uORF1 and uORF2 genomic location are indicated according to the nucleotide position described by Russo et al. (30). the single poly(A) signal used by all four ORFs for transcription termination is indicated. the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the ORF35-37 mRNA contains two uORFs. uORF2 overlaps with the start codon of the 5\u2032 ORF35 gene. its translation causes ribosomes to bypass ORF35 and instead reinitiate downstream at the ORF36 start site. in both cases, there was a dramatic reduction in the level of infectious virus produced from the uORF2 mutant, calculated to be 36.65-fold 0.11-fold by flow cytometry. uORF2-directed translation of ORF36 plays a key role in viral replication. this protein is of unknown function and expression has not been confirmed during infection. iSLK-PURO cells stably harboring the KSHV BAC16-iFLAG were either left untreated or lytically reactivated for 96 h. protein lysates were subjected to Western blotting with antibodies against ORF36, FLAG-tagged ORF35 or the ribosomal protein S6RP (as a loading control) the ORF36 construct harbors the native 5\u2032 UTR of the ORF35-37 mRNA, the uORF1 and uORF2 regulatory elements. the first 352 nt of ORF35 followed by Renilla luciferase, which serves as a reporter for ORF36 translation initiation. the ratio of Renilla luciferase to firefly luciferase from each construct indicated that the ratio of translation initiation at AUGORF35 to that at AUGORF36 is 0.4128 0.028:1.0. this is likely a modest underrepresentation of ribosome engagement at ORF35 due to the nonidentical levels of stability of Renilla between the two constructs. disruption of uORF2 alone (2) led to increased ORF35 translation and compromised expression of ORF36. disruption of AUGuORF1 (1) and AUGuORF2 (2) had no significant effect. however, ribosomes that would have been captured by AUGuORF2 now initiate at AUGORF35 and are thus precluded from reinitiating at ORF36. ase assay was performed 24 h posttransfection to determine the relative levels of firefly luciferase activity and Renilla luciferase activity. error bars represent the standard deviation of the results of comparisons between replicates. the majority of ribosomes that translate uORF1 do not reinitiate at AUGORF35, likely due to the inadequate intercistronic distance (9 nt) between AUGuORF1 and AUGO leaky scanning past AUGuORF1 and AUGuORF2 facilitates ORF35 expression. leaky scanning past uORF1 and uORF2 facilitates translation of ORF35. termination-reinitiation mechanism after both uORF1 and uORF2 enables translation of the downstream ORF36 gene. a model of the three translational programs governing expression from the ORF35-37 polycistronic mRNA. ribosomes initiate translation at uORF1, terminate translation, continue to scan, and then reinitiate translation downstream of the ORF35 start codon. mRNAs containing uORFs overlap a primary ORF (8, 22\u201326) uORFs could therefore expand the coding capacity of the transcriptome."}
