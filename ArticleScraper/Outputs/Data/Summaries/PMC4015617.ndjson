{"summary": "Background Acute respiratory infections represent a serious public health issue worldwide but virological aetiologies of Influenza Like Illnesses remain largely unknown in developing countries. this study represents the first attempt to characterise viral aetiologies of ILIs in Bolivia. there is an increasing interest in the epidemiology and characterization of influenza like Illnesses (ILIs), which are predominantly of viral aetiology. in adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia. in adults, viruses are the putative causative agents in a third of cases of community-acquired pneumonia, in particular influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, and coronaviruses. the number of samples that could be analysed each year at CENETROP was determined according to logistical considerations. we did not attempt to build a representative sample of specimens received at CENETROP (supposedly poorly representative of ILIs in the general population of Santa Cruz) but rather examined a similar number of samples in each age group to allow a comprehensive aetiological analysis in all age classes. 43 Year 2010 257 45.57 2011 163 28.90 2012 144 25.53 Age groups 0-4 69 12.23 5-9 29 5.14 10-19 91 16.13 20-29 95 16.84 30-39 90 15.96 40-49 70 12.41 50-59 59 10.46 60 61 10.82 Influenza vaccination history 65 11.52 2. 80 Before 2010 5 0.89 0.78 After 2010 60 10.64 2.69 Age groups 0-4 5 0.89 0.78 5-9 0 0.00 0.00 10-19 6 0.35 Enterovirus and Parechovirus - Influenza A 1 0.18 0.35 Virological results in age groups Of the 564 samples tested, 283 (50.2%) were positive for at least one virus (Table 1) with influenza viruses (Flu A: 15%; Flu B: 9%), rhinoviruses (hRV: 9%), coronaviruses E229&OC43 (hCoV E229&OC43) (5%) and respiratory syncytial virus h metapneumoviruses (hMPV) were detected in both children and adults with the most elevated rate of infection in the 60 yo age group (5%) and enteroviruses/parechoviruses were also found in both children and adults. in 2011 and 2012, the number of samples studied annually was lower (163 and 144, respectively) but still sufficient to elucidate the main peaks of activity with a major incidence of Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 in 2011 and Flu B in 2012. peaks were generally associated with a predominant virus (Flu B in March 2010, hRV in August 2010, Flu A/H3N2 in November 2010, Flu A(H1N1)pdm09 in October 2011 and Flu B the complete disappearance of hRSV infections in 2011 represents a specific case that was never encountered by the authors in Europe. phylogenetic analyses of influenza virus A and B sequences Cell culture isolates of influenza A/H3N2 (N = 4) and influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (N = 19) viruses were obtained. the first cluster, supported by a 98% bootstrap resampling value (Additional file 2), includes the 2012 Bolivian isolates. the second cluster, supported by a 100% bootstrap value (Additional file 3), includes the 2010 Bolivian isolates. the third cluster, supported by a 94% bootstrap value (Additional file 4), seems to be issued from 2007 Asian isolates. tree includes 2,639 complete coding sequences from GenBank and 4 complete coding sequences from this study, GenBank accession numbers KF612181-KF612211. clusters 1, 2 and 3 are detailed in Supplementary files (Additional file 5, Additional file 6 and Additional file 7 respectively) clusters 1, 2 and 3 are detailed in Additional files. cluster 1 (Additional file 8) includes 2011 and 2012 Bolivian isolates. the 2011 Bolivian isolates were collected from October to December. our final sample has equivalent numbers of swabs in the 0\u20139, 10\u201319, 20\u201329 and 30\u201339 age classes. it under-represents the 0\u20139 years old (yo) age group (which includes 35% of eligible samples received) and over-represents the 30\u201339, 40\u201349, 50\u201359 and 60 yo age groups (Additional file 1). 80 Before 2010 5 0.89 0.78 After 2010 60 10.64 2.69 Age groups 0-4 5 0.89 0.78 5-9 0 0.00 0.00 10-19 6 1.06 0.85 20-29 14 2.48 1.30 30-39 17 3.01 1.43 40-49 9 1.60 1.04 50-59 11 1.95 1.15 60 3 0.53 0.60 Virus detected 283 50.18 5.85 Influenza A/H1N1p 48 8.51 2.41 Influenza A/H3N2 37 6.56 2. the pattern of viral infections varied according to age groups. the elucidation rate was the highest (>60%) in samples from patients under the age of 10 yo and the lowest (40%) in patients 60 yo. inoviruses were identified in all age groups (up to 10% in patient over 60 years of age) 8 (9.4%) of the 85 influenza A viruses, 5 (11.4%) of the 44 rhinoviruses and 5 (17.8%) of the 28 hCoV E229&OC43 infections detected were diagnosed in a situation of co-infection. peaks included 30-50% of infections by different viruses. peaks included flu A/H3N2, flu A(H1N1)pdm09, flu B, rhinoviruses and coronaviruses E229&OC43. influenza virus A and B sequences cell culture isolates of influenza A/H3N2 (N = 4), influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 (N = 19) and influenza B2 (N = 11) viruses were obtained. eight-segment genomic sequences were produced for flu A/H3N2 isolates. the 2012 South American cluster may originate from 2010 Australian isolates. the second cluster, supported by a 100% bootstrap value (Additional file 3), includes the 2010 Bolivian isolates. the third cluster, supported by a 94% bootstrap value (Additional file 4), seems to be issued from 2007 Asian isolates. sequences from GenBank and 19 complete coding sequences from this study, GenBank accession numbers KF612181-KF612211. clusters 1, 2 and 3 are detailed in Supplementary files (Additional file 5, Additional file 6 and Additional file 7 respectively). cluster 1 includes a 2012 Bolivian isolate, together with isolates of various geographical origins. were collected from October to December and are related to german strains collected in February 2011 suggesting the circulation in Bolivia during the 2011 (South hemisphere) influenza season of viruses derived from those that circulated in Europe at the end of the previous (North hemisphere) influenza season. these strains cluster with a number of Bolivian and South American strains for which only HA sequences are available. cluster 2 includes 2009 and 2010 Bolivian isolates together with 2009 South American, Asian and North American isolates. Victoria-related Bolivian isolates appear in two distinct clusters, together with other South American isolates. the first cluster, supported by a 98% bootstrap resampling value, includes the 2012 Bolivian isolates. the second cluster, supported by a 100% bootstrap value, includes the 2010 Bolivian isolates. phylogenetic analysis of haemagglutinin (HA) of 2,643 influenza A/H3N2 viruses. the tree includes 2,639 complete coding sequences from GenBank. cluster 1 (Additional file 8) includes 2011 and 2012 Bolivian isolates. the 2011 Bolivian isolates were collected from October to December. the 2011 Bolivian isolates were related to german strains collected in February 2011 suggesting the circulation in Bolivia during the 2011 (South hemisphere) influenza season of viruses derived from those that circulated in Europe at the end of the previous (North hemisphere) influenza season. the viral aetiology of ILIs in Bolivia and the first in south America in the post-influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 period was not designed for providing a representative picture of the general Bolivian population. samples sent to CENETROP were not expected to faithfully represent ILIs in the region of Santa Cruz. the PAHO surveillance system reported an intense circulation of the virus in la Paz during the first months of the year. in 2011, a large outbreak occurred in Santa Cruz, while only a few cases were observed in la Paz. in 2012, an important outbreak was observed in La Paz, but not in Santa Cruz. an increasing number of influenza sequences has been made available since 2008. trees suggested the circulation in Bolivia during the study period of viruses originating from central and North America, Europe, Asia and Australia. representative gave oral consent for shipment of samples to CENETROP. samples were spiked by MS2 and T4 phages, used as internal controls. RNA and DNA were co-extracted from 200 L of each sample. hCoV E229&OC43, Rhinovirus (hRV, [23], Adenoviruses (hAdV, [24]), human metapneumoviruses A and B (hMPV, [26]), human Bocaviruses (hBoV, [27]) were used for virus isolation using MDCK cells and a standard isolation protocol (Additional file 11) PCR products were purified (Nucleofast PCR plate, Machrey Nagel) and sequenced using the NGS Ion Torrent technology. a library of barcoded 100\u2013200 nt fragments was built using the Diagenode Bioruptor UCD-200, the XpressTM Barcode Adapters kit and the AB Library BuilderTM. final sequencing was performed using the Personal Genome Machine\u00ae (PGMTM) System, the Ion PGMTM Sequencing anyone with fever of 37.8\u00b0C or higher, associated with one respiratory symptom was identified as ILI infection and eligible for investigation. all specimens had been sampled between day 0 and day 4 following clinical onset, sent to the laboratory at room temperature using a universal transport media and kept at -20\u00b0C upon reception. er reverse transcription of RNA genomes was performed using the TaqMan Transcriptase reverse reagent kit (Roche) amplifications were performed in a final volume of 25 L, using 3 L of nucleic acid solution, the Fast qPCR MasterMix with no Rox (Eurogentec) and a Bio-Rad CFX96 TouchTM real-time PCR Detection System. all 8 segments of influenza A virus were amplified in a single reaction using the EZ1\u00ae Qiagen instrument and the EZ1\u00ae Virus Mini Kit v2.0 without RNA Carrier. PCR products were purified (Nucleofast PCR plate, Machrey Nagel) and sequenced using the NGS Ion Torrent technology. on Torrent protocol were processed using the CLC Genomics Workbench software 6.04 (CLCbio, Aarhu, Denmark) and a home developed program and then mapped onto concatenated reference sequences. in the case of A/H1N1(2009) phylogenies, concatenated coding sequences of the eight segments from the complete genomic sequences produced as reported above from Bolivian strains were aligned with complete genomic sequences retrieved from databases. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors: Participate on sampling samples molecular biology, culture and sequencing parts and draft of paper.
