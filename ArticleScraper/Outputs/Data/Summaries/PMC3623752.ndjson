{"summary": "human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) belongs to the paramyxoviridae. it causes severe respiratory tract infections affecting mainly children and the elderly worldwide. there are no available vaccines or treatments except passive immunoprophylaxis. a targeted siRNA screen revealed clathrin-mediated endocytosis. a targeted siRNA screen revealed clathrin light chain, Eps-15, and AP-2 as important cellular factors in RSV infection. in primary NHEB cells RSV entry is a two-step process. particles (n = 457) were stained with anti-F-AF488 (green), anti-N-AF594 (red) and phalloidin-AF647 (pseudocolored white) the particles were imaged with a confocal microscope and analyzed for colocalization by Imaris. we used the presence of capsid antigens to distinguish between intact RSVs and VLPs. when purified virus preparations were incubated with HeLa cells at 4\u00b0C, immunoblotting after SDS-PAGE showed that more than half of the input N and P associated with the cells indicating that RSV binding in the cold was efficient. image series was generated using imageJ. (B) image series. image series was analyzed to detect spots with anti-F staining only. purified RSV was labeled with a lipophilic fluorescent dye, DiOC. it partitions into the viral membrane and can be quenched by the membrane-impermeable dye trypan blue (TB) after labeling, 80% of re-purified particles contained detectable DiOC. cells were triedpsinized on ice for 10 min, washed, permeabilized, stained with anti-N-AF647 or anti-F-AF647 and the MFI of AF647 measured by FACS. at indicated times cells were fixed and the MFI of DiOC measured by FACS with or without TB. the dequenching of DiOC became detectable after 30 min at 37\u00b0C. it reached a half maximum level at 90 min, and plateaued after 240 min. fusion events occurred on the average 50 min after endocytosis. endocytosis of RSV was quantified by measuring the amount of the incoming N protein that was trypsin resistant using FACS analysis 1 h after warming. infection was scored as a percentage of cells expressing GFP 6 hpi. the dose-dependence and toxicity of each inhibitor was carefully determined. each inhibitor was continuously present during following steps of the experiment. RSV (moi 3) or transferrin AF-488 (2 g/ml) were bound to cells at 4\u00b0C. after internalization at 37\u00b0C, RSV (1 h) or Trf-AF488 (20 min) cells were additionally stained by IIF. the number of actin stress fibers decreased, the cells rounded up, and transient blebs filled with actin formed on the cell surface. the ratio of G (globular) and F (fibrous) actin was 21 compared to 12 in control cells. this indicated that addition of virus resulted in transient actin depolymerization. heLa cells were pretreated with solvent (MOCK), cytochalasin D (CytoD), latrunculin A (LatA), jasplakinolide (Jas), nocodazole (Noc), taxol (Tax), nocodazole (Noc), nocodazole (Noc), taxol (Tax), nocodazole (Noc), nocodazole (Noc), nocodazo nocodazole and taxol that interfere with microtubules had no effect on RSV or SFV infection. actin and its regulators played a critical role during RSV endocytosis and infection. blebs, the involvement of actin, and the role of Cdc42 and PAK1 were required for RSV internalization and infection. purified RSV (moi 10) was bound at 4\u00b0C to serum-starved HeLa cells. the input virus was replaced with medium containing 10 kDa dextran-AF488. cells were fixed, permeabilized and stained with anti-F-AF594 (red) and anti-P-AF647 (blue) antibody. pretreatment of cells with EIPA blocked the increase in fluid phase uptake. results showed that RSV induces macropinocytosis and uses it for virus endocytosis. genistein (Gen), CAS879127-07-8, iressa, wortmannin (Wort), Ly294002 or PI-103 (D) staurosporine (Stau), rottlerin (Rott) or calphostine C (CalphC), (E) blebbistatin (Bleb), ML7 at indicated concentrations. each inhibitor was continuously present during following steps of the experiment. PI3K inhibitors boosted SFV infection was consistent with a distinct entry mechanism for this virus. inhibition of PKC (rottlerin, calphostin C) decreased RSV. both reduced RSV infection with little effect on SFV. wild type (WT) GFP- Rab5 and GFP-Rab7 were transiently expressed. some of the incoming RSV colocalized with GFP-Rab5 WT positive vacuoles. after 120 min, some colocalization with GFP-Rab5 WT was still observed. cells stained with anti-F-AF594 (red) and anti-P-AF647 (blue) antibody. cells were infected with RSV-A2 (moi 0.5) for 16 hours before fixation and staining with anti-N-AF647. pretreatment of cells with PIKfyve inhibitor (CAS 371942-96-7) had no effect on the RSV infection while SFV infection was decreased by 50%. this suggests that full maturation of macropinosomes was not required for RSV. virus inoculum was replaced with medium containing 100 M dec-RVKR-CMK and incubated for 6 before FACS analysis of GFP expressing cells. unbound virus was removed and cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h in the presence of inhibitor. ELPRFMNYTLNNAK 3+ and ELPRFMNYTLNNAK 3+ peptides. different SRM transitions for a given peptide were shown in different colors. aa 113\u2013131 and 109\u2013123 of F protein were shown in different colors. dec-RVKR-CMK inhibitor was applied 1 h after the virus inoculation. there was no inhibition indicating that the critical proteolytic step coincided with entry. dec-RVKR-CMK impaired viral fusion (Fig. 9C) in cells pretreated with dec-RVKR-CMK, the processing of the 50 kDa F1 protein did not occur. it peaked at 60 min when the precursor was fully consumed. the amount of F1 protein gradually decreased at later time points. we tested the effects of nine diagnostic inhibitors previously used in HeLa cells. they inhibited dynamin, macropinocytosis, and furin proteases. RSV infection was quantified by an image-based approach. the need for F1 processing was confirmed by dec-RVKR-CMK. the virus was grown in HEp-2 cells, and to minimize exposure to broken cells. the quality of virus purified by gradient centrifugation was confirmed by SDS-PAGE. the percentage of infected cells expressing GFP was measured by FACS. half of the particles represented intact virions because in addition to F (green) they contained N (red) 30% also stained with phalloidin (blue, pseudocolored white) indicating the presence of actin filaments. phalloidin was labeled with phalloidin to visualize cell boundaries. after 30 min virus particles containing N and F were present on the cell surface. this indicated viral particles and VLPs were endocytosed. we found that after 60 min, 77% VLP and 70% RSV-containing spots were, in fact, resistant to trypsin. that the total number of RSV- and VLP-containing spots decreased over time was probably caused by the accumulation of multiple particles in common endocytic vacuoles that represented single spots. single focal plane image of live cell samples was acquired with a confocal microscope before (green) and after TB addition (pseudocolored red/white) Arrowheads indicate virus spots that were not quenched after TB addition. ice and trypsinized for 10 min to remove virus remaining on cell surface. cells were washed and re-plated for up to 10 h before the percent of GFP expressing cells. fusion of RSV with cellular membranes was determined by FACS. cells with virus bound in cold were transferred to 37\u00b0C. at indicated times, they were placed on ice, incubated with trypsin to strip away surface-attached RSV, re-plated and incubated for 10 additional hours. maximum infection was reached within 180 min and the half time was around 30 min. internalization of the well-characterized CME cargo protein transferrin (Trf) was effectively inhibited by all. infection by semliki forest virus (SFV) was effectively blocked by all. RSV infection has been reported to be insensitive to an increase in endosomal pH. this was confirmed by the lack of influence of bafilomycin A, ammonium chloride, and monensin on RSV infection. this was confirmed by the lack of influence of bafilomycin A, ammonium chloride, and monensin on RSV infection. unbound virus was removed and cells warmed to 37\u00b0C. phalloidin-AF488 (pseudocolored white) and anti-F-AF647 (red) antibody were stained. anti-N-AF488 antibody and the MFI of AF-488 measured by FACS. disruption of actin filaments with cytochalasin D and latrunculin A strongly reduced RSV infection, whereas SFV infection was enhanced. the internalization of 10 kDa dextran-AF488, a soluble, fluorescent tracer, increased by 50% and 120% at low and high moi, respectively, over mock treated cells. most endocytosed viruses stained by anti-F and -P antibodies were localized in large, dextran-AF488 filled, intracellular vacuoles. psinized, fixed and stained with anti-N-AF488 antibody. cells were incubated with purified RSV (moi 30) or no virus control at 4\u00b0C. inoculum was replaced with medium containing 10 kDa dextran-AF488. virus was added to serum-starved HeLa cells for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were revers transfected with scrambled siRNA (siCtrl) or siRNA against EGFR (siRNA_1, siRNA_2) after 72 hours cells were infected with RSV (moi 0.3) for 18 hours, before fixation and image based analysis. antibodies against 42 different phosphorylated RTKs were used as probes. the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) was the only RTK for which activation was detected. a five-fold increase in phosphorylation compared to control cells. the results were consistent with productive RSV internalization by macropinocytosis. they revealed changes in actin morphology and polymerization after addition of RSV, and a role of EGFR, NHE, Cdc42, Pak1 and other factors similar to HeLa cells in RSV infection. heLa cells were transfected with a GFP-tagged constructs of Rab5 WT, -Rab5 Q79L (C/A), -Rab5 S34N (D/N), -Rab7 WT, -Rab7 Q67L (C/A), -Rab7 T22N (D/N) for 12 h. cells expressing GFP-tagged Rabs stained with anti-N-AF647. rrRSV was the only Rab construct that caused a significant decrease in RSV infection when overexpressed. expression of the C/A Rab5 (Q71L) did not affect infection. p27 peptide is located between F2 and F1 N-terminal to the fusion peptide in F1. removal of this peptide after endocytosis might be required to activate the F protein. at the N-terminus of F1 is a FP (fusion peptide) and at the C-terminus TM (transmembrane domain), numbers indicate aa position and red underlines specify peptide sequences detected in mass spectrometry. the N-terminal sequence of the p27 peptide (F protein) was quantified by a targeted mass spectrometry based on the selected reaction monitoring (SRM) ts were probed with anti-F1 antibody; unbound virus wash away. cells were placed at 37\u00b0C for indicated times before, lysis, SDS-PAGE, and processing for western blot. dec-RVKR-CMK treatment reduced infection by about 80%. aa 113\u2013131 and 109\u2013123 of p27 peptide were detected in HEp-2 cells extracts. neither peptide was present in HEp-2 control samples. aa transitions of the targeted peptides are included in table S1. RSV enters polarized bronchial epithelial cells by macropinocytosis. we tested polarized epithelial cells 16HBE14o obtained from human bronchial biopsies. after 9 days in culture, the distribution of the tight junction marker showed that the cells had reached a polarized phenotype. ytoD 1.5, 3 M), jasplakinolide (Jas 0.5, 1 M), IPA-3 (40, 80 M), genistein (Gen 50, 100 M), iressa (10, 20 M), Ly294002, EIPA (40, 80 M), and dec-RVKR-CMK (50, 100 M). the cells were infected with RSV for 20 h in the presence of the inhibitors, fixed and counterstained with DAPI accumulated within cytoplasmic vacuoles with a half time of about 30 min followed by fusion in the vacuoles with the half time of around 90 min. no fusion of viruses with the PM was detected, and no formation of syncytia by fusion-from-without was observed even after exposing cells to high moi. the significant delay between RSV internalization and fusion could at least be explained by the requirement for post-endocytic cleavage of F asp in virus endocytosis and infection; (4) Elevation of fluid uptake in the presence of virus; (5) Inhibition of endocytosis and infection by an inhibitor of the NHE exchangers. polarized epithelial cells monolayers derived from human bronchial tissue involved macropinocytosis and proteolytic activation of the F protein. iressa was only inhibitory when present during the first hour of virus cell contact confirming that its effect was entry-specific. infection decreased only by 50% suggesting that other RTKs may be able to compensate in long-term experiments. infection has previously been shown to promote cell survival mediated by PI3K/NFB. dynasore fails to inhibit RSV infection was recently reported by others. some of the vacuoles containing RSV were in fact Rab5- and later Rab7-positive. the lack of inhibition by Rab7 mutants implied that macropinosome maturation beyond the positive stages was not necessary. the hydrophobic fusion peptide \u2018cap\u2019 is rendered the most N-terminal sequence in F1. in other class I viral fusion proteins, the fusion sequence is invariably N-terminal. fusion occurs after some delay in these vacuoles. transformed bronchial epithelial 16HBE14o cells were grown in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FCS, 1% l-glutamine and 1% NEA for at least 9 days before infection. rSV-A2 was produced in HEp-2 cells.
