{"summary": "malaria is still a major cause of global human morbidity and mortality. annually 350\u2013500 million clinical malaria episodes occur, causing more than 1 million deaths each year. increasing spread of P. falciparum due to inadequate vector control, increasing drug resistance, and the lack of effective vaccine strengthens the need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. ine-sensitive P. falciparum strain 3D7 and the chloroquine-resistant strain W2 were investigated. compounds possessing an activated double bond revealed covalent, but reversible binding to the cysteine residue of the respective protease. aldol condensation with formaldehyde yielded the free acids 4 and 8 due to concurrent hydrolysis of the ester function. amides 26 and 27 without activated double bond were also synthesized by standard amide coupling methods. cell-line 293T resulting in an IC50 value of >160 mM. inhibition of falcipain-2 / -3 (FP-2 / -3) and antiplasmodial activity of non-peptidic Michael-acceptors derived from etacrynic acid. the ethyl ester derivative (9) is more potent than the etacrynic acid (8), both against falcipain-2 and -3. the dichloro-substituted compounds (e.g. 9, 20 are better inhibitors than the mono-ch. etacrynic acid amides are the most active inhibitors of falcipains and P. falciparum within the series. cytotoxicity/antiplasmodial ratio for the most active compound 23 is >8.5, indicating selectivity against the parasite. etacrynic acid amide as well as compound 23 displayed modest antiplasmodial activity in vitro with IC50 values of 9 and 18.8 M respectively. the high IC50 value of >160 M for compound 23 indicates selectivity against the parasite. the good inhibitory properties of 24 allow further affinity binding studies.
