{"summary": "PCR-positive wells were harvested and used for the production of virus stocks. every 2 days, cell culture supernatant was sampled and tested by real-time RT-PCR for increase of MERS-CoV\u2013specific viral RNA. 25 plaque-forming units of MERS-CoV were preincubated with diluted serum for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. RT-PCR and Sequencing All procedures followed protocols described previously [4\u20136]. a striking increase of diagnostic requests during the outbreak in jeddah was mainly caused by samples from jeddah. from 1 January to 28 April 2014, JRL received 6285 samples for RT-PCR testing for MERS-CoV. this suggests a 36.8-fold increase of the monthly workload in April. studies of reliability of laboratory procedures did not reveal any evidence for generic background contamination in the laboratory (Supplementary Data 1). Positive cases (y axis = cases per day) in King Fahd Hospital (KFH) vs all other hospitals recorded 3-day intervals starting on March 26 and ending on April 28 2014. all viruses pertaining to the jeddah outbreak clustered in 1 phylogenetic clade (Figure 2). Phylogenetic tree inferred using MrBayes [11] for concatenated coding regions of 105 Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomes or partial genomes sampled from humans and camels. single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were studied to better evaluate the diversity of viruses circulating in jeddah. the deviating sample was taken on 22 April and had a double peak in 1 SNP. further partial sequencing of this virus did not yield any other double peaks. 68 samples represented 40% of all positive samples identified at JRL in jeddah patients. this patient had a travel history to King Fahd Hospital in jeddah within 1 incubation time before onset of symptoms. 16 clinical samples from jeddah with projected viral loads of 5 106 copies per sample were selected and inoculated in vero B4 cells. the replication phenotype of all viruses was highly similar in preliminary experiments. 1 isolate termed MERS-CoV Jeddah_10306 was fully sequenced and chosen for further study. veroB4 cells infected at an MOI of 1 (A) showed total cytopathogenic effect (CPE) at 48 hours postinfection. A459 cells did not show any CPE even when infected at an MOI of 1 at 72 hours p.i. (B) all 3 viruses were subjected to plaque reduction neutralization assays using serum of a MERS patient with known antibody titer [6]. no relevant differences in the reduction of viral plaques were seen with any virus. from 1 January to 28 April 2014, JRL received 6285 samples for RT-PCR testing for MERS-CoV. of these samples, 5828 were received since 26 March, the date when the first case in the jeddah outbreak was tested. this suggests a 36.8-fold increase of the monthly workload in April. s, Distribution of cycle threshold (Ct) values in 1056 samples pertaining to investigations in cases in jeddah without hospital number (n = 18 positive samples) vs 3799 samples with hospital number (n = 150 positive samples) average Ct values in cases and contacts were 30 and 33.1. the cluster comprising viruses isolated from the jeddah/Makkah hospitals in April 2014 are highlighted with a red box. the al-Hasa 2013 hospital outbreak is highlighted in yellow and the 2013 Hafr-Al-Batin community outbreak [13] in green. all samples except 1 had the same combination of SNPs. the deviating sample was taken on 22 April and had a double peak in 1 SNP that was confirmed twice by repetition of RT-PCR and sequencing. further partial sequencing of this virus did not yield any other double peaks. 68 samples represented 40% of all positive samples identified at JRL in jeddah patients. this patient had a travel history to King Fahd Hospital in jeddah within 1 incubation time before onset of symptoms. the replication phenotype of all viruses was highly similar in preliminary experiments. 1 isolate termed MERS-CoV Jeddah_10306 was fully sequenced. the original viral isolate EMC/2012 [1] was compared as well. a459 cells did not show any CPE even when infected at an MOI of 1 at 72 hours p.i. (B) replication trials were repeated in parallel in both cell lines using a reduced MOI of 0.01 that causes a prolonged course of replication with multiple rounds of infection in culture. Ct values as a surrogate of viral loads were compared between samples from jeddah and other cities. the frequency distributions and median values suggested a pronunciation of lower viral load samples in Jeddah. concurrently circulating viruses were indeed distributed across at least 6 different clades, suggesting that these infections resulted from increased zoonotic activity or introduction of human viruses from other regions. one larger virus cluster was observed in Riyadh, associated with 1 specific hospital, suggesting nosocomial transmission (clade 2). we can provide a first side-by-side comparison of different viral strains of MERS-CoV. these virus isolates were representative of 2 likely nosocomial outbreaks in jeddah and Riyadh. the absence of differences in serum neutralization disfavors antigenic variability as a promoter of transmission. the number of new cases in KFH declined toward the end of the study period. this trend started even before changes such as the closure of emergency rooms and the transfer of infected patients were implemented. a similar effect has been documented during the SARS epidemic in china. a certain rate of positive test results in asymptomatic persons might be considered plausible. unnoticed replication may be transient, and low viral loads seen in contacts might not suffice to establish infection chains. a coincident increase of cases in Riyadh was result of multiple, independent sources with some phylogenetic evidence of nosocomial spread."}
