{"summary": "despite successful eradication of smallpox by the WHO-led vaccination programme, pox virus infections remain a considerable health threat. the permissiveness of pox infections is independent of hosts surface receptors, but correlates with the ability of the virus to infiltrate the antiviral host response. the problem of emerging and re-emerging pathogens is likely to be one of the main issues of medical science and public health in the twenty-first century [1] despite remarkable progress in the control and treatment of infectious diseases, the problem of emerging and re-emerging pathogens is likely to be one of the main issues of medical science and public health in the twenty-first century. virus-host dynamics have been analysed by yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) studies. no closer look at the dynamic changes of the human proteome during a VACV infection has been taken yet on a global scale. a significantly advanced data quality was achieved by derivating the peptides on a solid phase support with 4-Sulfophenyl isothiocyanate. results PSD spectra of SPITC derivatized peptides improve protein identification efficiency Improved protein identification by combined Mascot search of the underivatised PMF. the peptide mass fingerprint of tryptic digested protein standard serum albumin (bovine) before and after derivatization is shown in Figure 2. Enhanced sensitivity of SPITC derivatization on solid phase support. many peptides could no longer be detected after derivatization. the intensity is normalised on the precursor ion of the underivatised PSD spectra. the improved coverage of the precursor ion y-series raised the Mascot Ion Score of the peptide with the mass of 1480.4 Da. the improved s/n ratio and increased signal intensity of the solid phase supported approach in PSD mode enlarges the coverage of the precursor ions' y-series and simplifies the automation of peak picking. the comparative Proteome Analysis of HEK293 cells led to the identification of 24 modulated human proteins as well as 3 viral proteins. pI pI pI A-1 P04075 45(35) 2 7 40 41 -1 8.3 7.5 0.8 A-2 Q6FHZ0 179(36) 2 8 36 34 2 8.9 7.6 1.3 A-3 P25705 132(35) 3 6 60 50 10 9.2 6.3 2.9 A-4 P25705 94(35) 3 5 60 49 11 9.2 5.8 3.4 A-5 P38117 86(36) 2 9 28 26 P63244 282(36) 4 13 36 31 5 7.6 6.1 1.5 C-2 Q4G1B8 117(42) 1 6 24 25 -1 8.6 6.4 2.2 C-3 1BD9A 71(36) 2 7 21 20 1 7.2 6.3 0.9 C-4 1BD9A 55(36) 1 7 21 21 0 7.2 6.4 0.8 C-5 Q6FHP5 237(34) 3 11 30 29 1 5.6 5.5 0.1 C-6 Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4H (eIF-4H) B-4 -

VACV possesses a profilin homologue by itself. unambiguous mapping of peptides with completely known primary sequences to proteins registered in databases is remarkably simplified. however, the application of SPITC derivatization for protein identification from complex mixtures is limited by the reduction of the peptides' signal intensities following N-terminal sulfonation. the infection of HEK293 cells with active and inactivated Vaccinia Virus IHD-W significantly affects the cells' energy metabolism. the enhanced expression of the enzyme malate dehydrogenase (A-2) is directly associated with a boost in the energy metabolism, which serves the viruses' need for energy for DNA replication. all changes detected in the human proteome profile caused by the infection indicate an enhancement of the metabolic rate of the glycolysis as well as of the oxidative phosphorylation. the protein eIF-4H stimulates protein biosynthesis, ATP hydrolysis and helicase activity of eIF-4A. heterogeneous protein complex splices introns of the hnRNA. the protein is a known link between the apoptosis cascade and the c-myc oncogene. a high FUBP1 expression increases expression level of c-myc. the alterations caused by the infection are results of the fact that the virus is taking control of the cells' gene expression as well as the protein biosynthesis. this results in an altered expression profile of apoptosis-relevant genes caused by viral gene products. the presence of dsRNA activates the dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine kinase (PKR) which phosphorylates the -subunit of the translation initiation factor eIF-2 which is essential for hek 293 cells infected with active and inactivated VACV IHD-W inhibit the expression of the protein Guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta 2-like 1 (C-1) which is an acceptor for activated protein kinase C (PKC) the reduced expression of the proteasome subunit alpha type-7-like (C-2) can be seen as a further cellular defence. the proteasome subunit alpha type-7-like (C-2) is part of the proteasome complex. it cleaves peptides proteolytically at the amino acids Arg, Phe, Tyr, Leu and Glu. the phosphatidylethanolamine-binding protein (C-3, C-4) is modified by an infection with active and inactivated VACV IHD-W. nexin 3 (E-3) has a binding domain (PX domain) for phospholipids and transports proteins within cells from organelles to membranes. profilin (E-4) binds actin and participates in the build-up of the cytoskeleton. there is no difference between the identified alterations of the energy metabolism and just one differentially expressed protein associated with gene expression and protein biosynthesis (B-10) the modulation of apoptosis is clearly affected by effects that correlate with infectious viruses. the absence of nucleophosmin in cells infected with infectious viruses may be the response on viral dsRNA resulting from transcription of viral DNA. 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC), biammonium citrate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), trypsin Profile IDG Kit and the ProteoSilver Plus Silver Stain Kit were bought from Sigma-Aldrich (Taufkirchen, Germany). TRIzol\u00ae Reagent was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, USA) proteomes of all three cell culture approaches were purified 9 h post infection. UV inactivation of VACV IHD-W Virus stock solution was centrifuged for 1 h at 21,000 g and 4\u00b0C. proteins were reduced for 15 min at 60\u00b0C with solution A (10 vol.-% 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 M urea, 30 vol.-% glycerol, 140 mM SDS, 20 mM DDT) in the second dimension the proteins were separated in a 12-%-polyacrylamide gel (250 200 1 mm3) at 4 W, 600 V and 30 mA for 14 h at 12\u00b0C. mismatched spots representing differences in protein expression were manually checked and selected for mass spectrometric analysis. in-gel trypsination Differences in the protein expression profile were identified by using the image analysis software Melanie 7.0. thiol groups were carboxyamidomethylated by adding 6 l 1 M IAA at 25\u00b0C for 30 min in the dark. excessive iodoacetamide was converted with 1 l 2 M DTT at 60\u00b0C for 15 min before the proteolytic digest was induced by addition of 1 g trypsin. derivatised peptides were washed five times with 0.1% TFA and three times with 10 mM biammonium citrate prior to elution. 0.5 l matrix (10 mg CHCA in 1 ml ACN/0.1% TFA [1:1 v/v]) was added and the spot was air-dried. 100 profiles accumulated from ten laser shots were recorded in positive ion reflectron mode with a laser intensity of 4.0 J and a maximum laser-repetition rate of 5.0 Hz at a pulse extraction of 1500 m/z (delay-time). an external 5-points calibration was performed by using appropriate peptide standard (calibration Mix) 500-3500 Da [LaserBio Labs] prior to each measurement. fonate (CHAPS), a-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA), acetonitrile (ACN), trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), 4-sulfophenyl isothiocyanate (SPITC), biammonium citrate, bovine serum albumin (BSA), sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), trypsin profile IDG kit and the ProteoSil proteomes of all three cell culture approaches were purified 9 h post infection. UV inactivation of VACV IHD-W Virus stock solution was centrifuged for 1 h at 21,000 g and 4\u00b0C. success of inactivation was checked by immunofluorescence staining of infected cells. proteins were reduced for 15 min at 60\u00b0C with solution A (10 vol.-% 0.5 M Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 6 M urea, 30 vol.-% glycerol, 140 mM SDS, 20 mM DDT) in the second dimension the proteins were separated in a 12-%-polyacrylamide gel (250 200 1 mm3) for 14 h at 12\u00b0C in a horizontal system. the gel containing the best resolution and most spots was chosen as the master gel. the mismatched spots representing differences in protein expression were manually checked and selected for mass spectrometric analysis. thiol groups were carboxyamidomethylated by adding 6 l 1 M IAA at 60\u00b0C for 30 min in the dark. excessive iodoacetamide (IAA) was converted with 1 l 2 M DTT at 60\u00b0C for 15 min. derivatised peptides were washed five times with 0.1% TFA and three times with 10 mM biammonium citrate. 0.5 l matrix (10 mg CHCA in 1 ml ACN/0.1% TFA [1:1 v/v]) was added and the spot was air-dried. ten m/z values greater than 1200 were automatically selected with descending intensity by the Launchpad Software (Kratos Analytical) for post source decay (PSD) measurement. 100 profiles accumulated from ten laser shots were accumulated for one PSD spectrum which was recorded in positive ion reflectron mode with a laser intensity of 4.0 J.
