{"summary": "RCHY1 and CAMK2D were identified as interacting partners of SUD. independently, plasmids expressing an ectopic GFP\u2013SUD fusion were transfected into HEK293 cells. CAMK2D was also identified to bind to SUD in the same assay. ificance curves were determined using c = 0.5 and x0 = 0.5 cutoff parameters. missing quantifications imputed with noise simulating detection limit. negative controls are YFPN\u2013RCHY1 in combination with YFPC vector. lysates were purified with GFP-trap and analyzed with anti-HA and anti-GFP antibodies. SUD protein tagged with NLS-GFP colocalizes with the SUD protein at the lacO spot, indicating an interaction between these two proteins. a physical interaction between RCHY1 and CAMK2D has never been examined in vivo. the RCHY1 protein as an interacting partner of SUD consists of 261 aa residues. the RCHY1 protein as an interacting partner of SUD consists of 261 aa residues. RCHY1 amino acids 95\u2013144 and SUD-NM are crucial for interaction. one fragment contained residues 1\u2013144 and was thus lacking the RING-finger domain. the other contained residues 95\u2013261 and was devoid of the calmodulin-binding region. SUD-NM is located between the X-domain and the PLpro domain of SARS-CoV Nsp3. it consists of three subdomains: SUD-N, SUD-M, and SUD-C. both SUD-NM and SUD-M are indispensable for the interaction. MERS-CoV contains a homolog to SUD-MC, but not to SUD-N. the interaction between RCHY1 and MERS-MC was also analyzed by split-YFP fluorescence microscopy. vivo ubiquitination assay revealed that SUD dramatically promoted p53 ubiquitination. negative control shows that GFP was not ubiquitinated by RCHY1. compared with lane 2, lane 3 shows that SUD strongly augmented ubiquitination. PLpro possesses deubiquitinating (DUB) and deISGylating activities. the PLpro was not able to deubiquitinate p53 (Fig. 3B) like SUD, the SUD\u2013PLpro fusion protein was also able to augment ubiquitination of p53. anti\u2013phospho-Ser/Thr blot of immunoprecipitates did not reveal phosphorylation of RCHY1 by CAMK2D. similar phosphorylation intensities of RCHY1 were detected in the absence (lane 2) and presence of SUD (lane 3). plasmids expressing Myc-YFPN\u2013RCHY1 and YFPC\u2013SUD were cotransfected into HEK293 cells growing on coverslips in a 24-well plate. at 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed. at 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed. RCHY1 is located in both the nucleus and the cytosol. p53 interacts with RCHY1 fragment 1\u2013144 mainly in the nucleus and only to a small extent in the cytosol. p53-RFP fusion was cotransfected with YFPN-RCHY1 and YFPC-SUD plasmids into HEK293 cells. p53-GFP was able to pull down SUD\u2013PLpro in the coIP assay only if RCHY1 was also expressed. negative control shows no unspecific binding of RCHY1 or SUD\u2013PLpro to the GFP-trap. plasmids expressing YFPN-SUD\u2013PLpro and YFPC\u2013RCHY1 were transfected into HEK293 cells for a split-YFP assay. by chance, an interaction between RCHY1 and SARS\u2013CoV PLpro was discovered. plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells grown in a six-well plate. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were harvested for total RNA extraction. a coIP assay was performed to further confirm the binding of PLpro to RCHY1. in vitro deubiquitination assay of RCHY1 by PLpro proteins without (lane 2) and with HIS tag (lane 3) HEK293 cells were cotransfected with GFP\u2013RCHY1, HA-ubiquitin, camodulin1-RFP, and CAMK2D\u2013MycYFP N-expression fusion. the 0.025-M SARS-CoV PLpro was used with different concentrations (1, 2, 4, 8 M) of the fluorogenic substrate uniquitin-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin (AMC; Boston Biochem) the fluorescence signal generated by AMC release was measured using an Flx800 fluorescence spectrophotometer. a calibration curve was generated via measuring the fluorescence of free AMC in the reaction buffer. SUD\u2013PLpro fusion resulted in further degradation of p53 compared with PLpro alone. the tumor suppressor protein p53 has been demonstrated to possess an inhibitory effect on some viruses such as HIV-1 and human papillomavirus. p53 inhibits replication of a SARS-CoV. HCT116/ACE2 with p53 (+/+) and without p53 (/) were seeded at 2 105 cells per mL. after 24 h, cells were infected in quadruplicate with SARS-CoV. p53 expression was monitored by Western blot using anti-p53 antibodies in the respective cell lines. the observed fold differences between the use of replicons and virus infection are attributed to the commonly lower replication efficiencies of coronavirus replicons. WB of SW480 pRTR cells containing mutated, nonfunctional p53. upper band at 24 h + DOX represents induced functional p53 protein. expression of both proteins is thus induced by DOX. p53 pressure down-regulates SARS-CoV replicon. p53 pressure down-regulates replicon. pBAC-SARS-Rep-R(enilla)luc was applied as a control reporter. MERS-CoV PLpro and NL63 PLP1 showed clear interaction with RCHY1. a small amount of HA-RCHY1 could be coimmunoprecipitated by GFP-NL63 PLP2. a split-YFP assay was performed to further confirm the interaction. at 24 h after transfection, cells were inoculated with NL63 viruses of MOI 0.4 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. total RNA was extracted from cell lysates. yFPN was fused at the N terminus of MERS PLpro and NL63 PLP1/2. NL63 replication was reduced by 30% in cells overexpressing p53. this implies that p53 is an inhibitory factor not only for SARS-CoV but also for other HCoVs. RCHY1 and CAMK2D were identified as interacting partners of SUD. SUD with a C- or N-terminal GFP tag was recombinantly expressed in HEK293 cells and enriched from cell lysates using agarose beads (ChromoTek) Volcano plots show enrichment factors of all quantified proteins in C-terminally (A) or N-terminally (B) tagged SUD-expressing samples over vector-only controls. missing quantifications were imputed with noise simulating the detection limit. IP samples were analyzed by 12% (wt/vol) SDS/PAGE and Western blotting (WB) with anti\u2013SARS-CoV Nsp3, anti-HA, and anti-GFP antibodies. at 24 h after transfection, cells were lysed and the lysates were purified with GFP-trap. the YFP fragments were fused to the C-terminal (YFPC) and N-terminal (YFPN) YFP fragments. if SUD binds to a tested candidate in this assay, the YFP fragments will assemble, leading to fluorescence emission (37). CAMKII isoforms can phosphorylate RCHY1 at T154/S155 in vitro. the RCHY1 protein as an interacting partner of SUD consists of 261 aa residues. the N-terminal fragment comprising residues 1\u201394 contains a CHY zinc-finger domain (residues 20\u201394) that is responsible for binding to calmodulin (14). the middle region of RCHY1 comprising residues 120\u2013137 is required for binding to tumor protein p53 and to CDK9 (8, 24). RCHY1 fragment 95\u2013144 interacted with SUD in the cytosol of HEK293 cells. the region in common between these two fragments was consequently supposed to be required for binding to SUD. RCHY1 binding sites for p53 and CDK9 are within this region (8, 24) YFP signal was examined by fluorescence microscopy. YFPN was fused to the N terminus of RCHY1. YFPC was fused to the C terminus of truncated SUD fragments. in vivo and in vitro, we examined whether binding to SUD influences the ubiquitin ligase activity of RCHY1. the region of RCHY1 involved in binding to p53 is within the RCHY1 fragment (residues 95\u2013144) that binds to SUD. however, the in vivo ubiquitination assay revealed that SUD dramatically promoted the ubiquitination of p53. the in vivo ubiquitination assay was carried out as described in A. the PLpro domain occurs next to the C terminus of the SUD within SARS\u2013CoV Nsp3. the PLpro releases the nonstructural proteins Nsp1, Nsp2, and Nsp3 from the viral polyproteins. CAMK2D, as a member of the CAMKII family, binds to RCHY1. the interaction between SUD and CAMK2D does not interfere with phosphorylation of RCHY1 and stabilizes it. omycin to a final concentration of 1 M were added to the cells. two hours after the treatment, cells were lysed and the lysates were purified with GFP-trap. the samples of IP and input were analyzed by 12% (wt/vol) SDS/PAGE/WB. indicated plasmids were transfected into HEK293 cells growing on coverslips in 10-cm culture dishes. the split-YFP experiment was carried out as described before. split-YFP assay revealed that p53 interacts with RCHY1 fragment 1\u2013144 mainly in the nucleus and only to a small extent in the cytosol. p53-GFP was able to pull down SUD\u2013PLpro only if RCHY1 was also expressed. CDK9 is another important protein kinase involved in RCHY1\u2013p53 signaling. similar to CAMK2D, CDK9 can directly phosphorylate p53 at Ser392 (24) PLpro Binds to RCHY1 and promotes its Accumulation. HA-tagged PLpro and GFP or GFP\u2013RCHY1 fusion were transfected into HEK293 cells grown in 10-cm culture dishes. cell lysates were prepared 24 h posttransfection and subjected to Western blotting with anti-Myc and anti-lamin A antibodies. RCHY1 was not deubiquitinated by PLpro, but the protein must be stabilized by a different, as-yet-unknown mechanism. we tested the effect of PLpro on RCHY1 in an in vitro deubiquitination assay. deubiquitination assay of the SARS-CoV PLpro was performed in 20 mM TrisHCl, 150 mM NaCl (pH 7.9), 2 mM DTT at 25 \u00b0C. the reaction volume was 50 L. ctopic HA-tagged RCHY1 was transfected into cells as a positive control. overexpression of RCHY1 resulted in p53 degradation. PLpro alone was also found to cause p53 degradation compared with PLpro alone. p53/ and p53+/+ HCT116/ACE2 cells grew equally well. p53 inhibits replication of a SARS-CoV. pBAC-SARS-Rep-R(enilla)Luc DNA was transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 3000. pBAC-SARS-Rep-R(etridia)Luc RNA was cotransfected with N-RNA by electroporation of cells. metridian luciferase activity was determined from medium supernatant after 20 h. cons and virus infection are attributed to the commonly lower replication efficiencies of coronavirus replicons. viable virus is much more efficient due to multicycle infection and exponential growth when using low multiplicities of infections (MOIs, 0.001). plasmid pBAC-SARS-Rep-RLuc was transfected into HEK293 cells at increasing concentrations of a p53-expressing plasmid. p53 strongly reduced replication of the SARS-CoV replicon by 65%. p53 pressure down-regulates SARS-CoV replication. a small amount of HA-RCHY1 could be coimmunoprecipitated by GFP-NL63 PLP2. a split-YFP assay was performed to confirm the interaction. the indicated plasmids were transfected to HEK293 cells growing in 10-cm culture dishes. HEK293 cells were cotransfected with plasmids overexpressing RFP-ACE2 and plasmids overexpressing p53-GFP. at 24 h after transfection, cells were inoculated with NL63 viruses of MOI 0.4 at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. all tested PLpros led to degradation of endogenous p53. p53 inhibits viral replication of other HCoVs. p53 is an inhibitory factor not only for SARS-CoV but also for other HCoVs. the mechanism of how SUD and PLpro stimulate the accumulation of RCHY1 remains unclear. it is known that phosphorylation by CAMKII or CDK9 leads to polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation of RCHY1. but SUD does not impair the phosphorylation activity of CAMK2D toward RCHY1. the association of SUD and CAMK2D might alter the affinity of CAMK2D for other proteins, e.g., for its candidate binding partner IFN- receptor 2 (IFNGR2). p53 was found to serve as an antiviral factor against diverse positive-sense single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) viruses. interaction of PLP2, PLpro, and cellular deubiquitinase HAUSP was demonstrated. p53 inhibits replication of coronaviruses. coVs have developed different ways to down-regulate p53. the fragments c-Myc-YFPN (amino acids 1\u2013155) and HA-YFPC (amino acids 156\u2013239) were amplified with designed primers (Table S1) from the template plasmids pSPYNE-35S and pSPYCE-35S (37), respectively. the obtained PCR fragments were subsequently cloned into the pTREX-dest30-prA Gateway-compatible vector CAMK2D and p53 were selected from a human cDNA library of 5,000 different, individually cloned genes in pDONR223 vectors. CAMK2D and p53 were then cloned from pDONR223 to split-YFP vectors via LR reaction.

Western blot protocols were described elsewhere. HEK293 cells growing on 10-cm dishes were cotransfected with p53. at 23 h posttransfection, cells were treated with PMA to a final concentration of 20 ng/mL and ionomycin to a final concentration of 1 M to activate CAMK2D. the resulting PCR product was digested with restriction enzymes NheI and XhoI for ligation into pET-28a (Novagen) Cloning was designed to include an N-terminal hexahistidine (His6) tag and a thrombin cleavage site. expression of the PLpro gene and purification were carried out by a method described previously (64). qPCR and luciferase measurement data are shown as mean SD of tri- or quadruplicated values. qPCR and luciferase measurement data are analyzed by one-way or two-way ANOVA with Bonferroni s posttest (or by t test) CAMK2D and p53 were selected from a human cDNA library of 5,000 different, individually cloned genes in pDONR223 vectors.
