{"summary": "surgical masks are neither tested nor certified for use as respiratory protective devices. they are classified under United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Diaz and Smaldone recently modeled effects of mask-related aerosol transmission between individuals. they included environmental airflow in the room and mask protection, both deflection (e.g., face seal leakage) and filtration effects, with masks placed on either the infectious Source or the Receiver. 204 ft3, 6.25 ft length x 5.25 ft width x 6.25 ft height. no ambient airflow (0 air exchanges per hour), all air movement in the chamber was secondary to the coughing or breathing of the Source and the Receiver. source head was connected to a nebulizer and exhaled radioactive aerosols. a filter was attached to the Receiver head to capture and quantify inhaled radioactive aerosols (exposure) (A). an identical ventilated manikin, the Receiver, contained a filter designed to capture all inhaled particles quantifying health care worker exposure. for all experiments the Receiver pump was set for either the same tidal breathing pattern or coughing. the nebulizer was filled with 3 mL of 0.9% normal saline labeled with technetium-99m and run for 8 min. radiolabeled wet aerosols simulated infectious particles released during tidal breathing and coughing. both the natural fit and SecureFit surgical masks had identical filtration materials (BFE>99.9% @ 3 microns, PFE = 99.8% @ 0.1 microns, Delta P 5.0 H2O/cm2) the surgical masks were never sealed to the face. the surgical masks were never sealed to the face. mask filtration was measured by determining the radioactivity on the various masks as a percentage of the Activity Exhaled. the capture efficiency is the quantity of radioactivity exhaled by the Source captured on the filter placed on the Source. chamber was fitted with an exhaust fan behind the Source manikin head. chamber flow in ft3/min was adjusted by regulating fans using a balonometer. ACH was converted to air exchanges per hour (ACH) Source head was connected to a nebulizer and exhaled radioactive aerosols. a filter was attached to the Receiver head to capture and quantify inhaled radioactive aerosols (exposure) (B). the Receiver pump was set for either the same tidal breathing pattern or coughing. simulated cough was generated by a series of 1.5-liter breaths generated by the pump. for each cough the nebulizer was triggered first, filling the inspiratory tubing with aerosol (5 sec), then the Harvard pump was energized and the full volume expelled rapidly (1 sec). radiolabeled wet aerosols simulated infectious particles released during tidal breathing and coughing. radiolabeled wet aerosols simulated infectious particles released during tidal breathing and coughing. mask combinations were assessed: no mask (maximal exposure), the surgical mask (SMnat), an N95 respirator (N95) and the N95 respirator with a Vaseline seal (N95vas) the seal was created with a seam of Vaseline placed around the perimeter of the respirator on either the source or receiver. the surgical masks were never sealed to the face. a calibrated rate meter (10 Ci; Ludlum Measurements Inc, Sweetwater, TX), or a calibrated microwell (10Ci-10 mCi; Kemble Instruments, Hamden, CT) the capture efficiency is the quantity of radioactivity exhaled by the Source captured on the filter placed on the Source. a p-value 0.05 defined statistical significance. 0.67-0.77 1.24 0.38 1.81 Negative Pressure Room 2 1.07 0.24-1.89 1.35 1.51 1.63 2 0.98 0.28-1.67 1.54 0.39 1.99 Cough N Source MMAD 95%CI 16% 84% GSD No Flow Room 3 1.45 1.41-1.49 2.59 0.76 1.85 3 1.04 0.97-1.12 1.44 0.56 1.60 Hospital Room 3 1.52 1.32-1.72 2.96 0.80 1.92 4 0.53 0.45-0 an asterisk (*) denotes significance for a p-value 0.05 using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. Exposure data for cough, expressed as a percent of aerosol exhaled with a two-sided 95% CI, plotted for different masks on the Source or Receiver. in the Negative pressure room applying either surgical mask or respirator to the Source resulted in statistically significant reductions in exposure. the major differences in exposure were due to outward leakage of particles around the faceseal perimeter (deflection) at the Source. each mask on the Source markedly reduced receiver exposure even if the mask had a poor capture efficiency. SF surgical mask filters 50%, the N95 80\u201390%, and a sealed N95 100%. in all three rooms, during coughing, distributions contained larger particles than during tidal breathing. 6% 84% GSD N Receiver MMAD 95%CI 16% 84% GSD No Flow Room 3 1.45 1.41-1.49 2.59 0.76 1.85 3 1.04 0.97-1.12 1.44 0.56 1.60 Hospital Room 3 1.52 1.32-1.72 2.96 0.80 1.92 4 0.53 0.45-0.61 1.30 0.32 2.02 Negative Pressure Room 3 1.30 1.06-1.54 2.56 0.49 2.29 3 0.61 0.55-0.68 2.56 0.34 an asterisk (*) denotes significance for a p-value 0.05 using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance. Exposure data for cough, expressed as a percent of aerosol exhaled with a two-sided 95% CI, plotted for different masks on the Source or Receiver. major differences in exposure were due to outward leakage of particles around the faceseal perimeter (deflection) at the Source. each mask on the Source markedly reduced receiver exposure even if the mask had a poor capture efficiency. the SF surgical mask and the N95 capture 100% of the aerosol exhaled with a two-sided 95% CI mask on Source. the study does not suggest or support the use of surgical masks as a means of respiratory protection. the patient in a negative pressure room was to wear a surgical mask for a period of time prior to the entry of a HCW. in the hospital room, when there was an increased outward leakage at the Source there was reduced protection (reduced RPF) at the Receiver. reducing facepiece resistance would reduce outward leakage. our aerosols are aqueous and particle distributions will be affected by changes in ambient relative humidity. wet nebulizers provide saturated air so the aerosols leaving the Source manikin always are insensitive to room air humidity."}
