{"summary": "the main viruses associated with respiratory disease and loss of performance in racehorses are equine influenza virus (EI), equine herpesvirus 1 and 4 (EHV-1 and EHV-4) and equine rhinitis viruses A and B (ERAV and ERBV) in 1981, mandatory vaccination against EI was introduced for Thoroughbred racehorsesin Ireland and since then no race meetings have been cancelled due to EI. the aim of this serological study was to identify respiratory viruses circulating amongst elite racehorses in a training yard in Ireland. the study was conducted in 30 Thoroughbred racehorses during the Flat season. seroconversion was defined as a 4-fold or higher rise in CF or HI antibody titers. 154 (71%) were from two-year-old horses, 35 (16%) were from the three-year-old horses and 28 (13%) were collected from four-year-old horses. all the horses had undetectable or low antibody titres (20) against ERAV at the time of first sampling in April. one seronegative two-year-old colt had mounted a significant antibody response to ERAV within four weeks of arriving in the training yard. clinical signs, including inappetence, dullness, nasal discharge, limb oedema, enlarged submandibular lymph nodes and occasional coughing, were observed in seven of the in-contact two-year roconversions to ERAV decreased with time, with two in July. one horse seroconverted in august and one in September, which had seroconverted previously in may. no clinical respiratory signs were observed in the three-year-old horses. the time from seroconversion to ERAV until the titers decreased to insignificant levels ranged from three weeks to five months. only one seroconversion to ERBV was observed in this study, a two-year-old horse seroconverted in June without any associated clinical respiratory signs. ERAV-inoculated ponies developed respiratory tract disease characterized by pyrexia, nasal discharge, adventitious lung sounds, and enlarged mandibular lymph nodes. the clinical signs observed during this study were associated with the seroconversions. previous studies have demonstrated the complexity of poor performance syndrome in Thoroughbred racehorses. the seroconversion to ERAV in the four-year-old horse and the reinfection of two of the younger horses were not associated with clinical signs or reduced performance. experimental studies have indicated that ERAV infection stimulated a protective response and that reinfection is asymptomatic. the dynamics of ERAV infection in horse populations are poorly understood but virus persists in horses even in the presence of high levels of antibodies. the relationship between neutralizing antibodies and clinical protection has been established. it is likely that the older horses in this study that were seronegative by the CF test were exposed to ERAV in their first year of training and had neutralizing antibodies at the start of the study. however, this hypothesis remains unproven and it is also possible that although they were in the same yard as the two-year-old horses, they may not have been exposed to the virus. ERAV is not contained in any of the vaccines that are currently available. no clinical signs were attributable to reinfection."}
