{"summary": "nose and throat swab samples from 416 ARTI patients were checked for 13 respiratory viruses using multiple reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays for common respiratory viruses, including influenza viruses (Flu) A, B, and adenoviruses (PICs), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1\u20133, combined with real-time RT-PCR for human metapneumovirus different patterns of clinical symptoms were associated with different respiratory viruses. the high prevalence of viruses (PIC, FluA, HCoVs and ADV) reported here strongly highlight the need for the development of safe and effective therapeutic approaches. 13 respiratory virus in adults with ARTIs admitted to an ED in china. the study was performed in accordance with the national ethics regulations. participants were recieved \"Written Informed Consent\" on the study's purpose. cDNA was synthesized from 10 L RNA eluate using random hexamer primers and AMV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) as described previously [6]\u2013[8].
