{"summary": "HFMD is a common viral illness that usually affects infants and children younger than 5 years old. the disease has been reported globally since first reported in new Zealand in 1957, but larger outbreaks with higher morbidity and mortality have increased recently in the Asian Pacific region. there are no vaccine or antiviral drugs available for the disease. most of the herbs listed in Table 1 have not been investigated for their antiviral activity against pathogens of HFMD disease. more is known about the active components of those plants. cytotoxicity was assayed on Vero cells at a maximum concentration of 1000 g/mL. those showed toxicity against Vero cells were further tested to determine a CC50 value. IC50: 50% inhibitory activity against virus infection-induced cytopathic effect. psum mineral (CaSO4 2H2O) and talcum powder (magnesium silicate hydrate) have been prescribed for HFMD. on the basis of the frequency of their uses for HFMD, twelve medicinal materials were purchased from local herbal markets. rhabdomyosarcoma (RD) cell line and vero cell line were purchased from Cell Bank of Chinese Academy Sciences (Shanghai, China) the cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) with high glucose, supplemented with 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 2 mM L-glutamine, nonessential amino acids, and sodium pyruvate. in, quercitrin, isoquercitrin, acyclovir (ACV) and methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Shanghai, China) the super signal ECL reagent kit was purchased from Thermo Fisher (Rockford, IL, USA) 570 nm was measured in a Versa Max microtiter plate reader. the concentration of an extract that is necessary for 50% inhibition of the virus-induced CPE was expressed as the IC50. the infection was performed in triplicate samples. Vero cells in 24 well plates were preincubated with 40 g/mL HCT or with 200 g/mL MHB. at the end of the treatment, the extract was removed by replacing the culture medium with fresh DMEM or left in the culture. the cells were infected with EV71 or CVA16. cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase MMLV (RNase H) from 500 ng total RNA with oligo-dT primer. cDNA was amplified by using gene-specific primers and Taq DNA Polymerase (TaKaRa, Tokyo, Japan) the gradient condition was 15% B (V/V) at 0\u201316 min, 15\u201325% B at 16\u201330 min, 25% B at 30\u201332 min, 25\u201330% B at 32\u201335 min, 30\u201333% B at 37\u201340 min, 33% B at 40\u201345 min, 33\u201360% B at 45\u201360 min, and 60\u201315% B at 60\u201365 min. two grams of ground specimen was soaked with 30 mL of distilled water at room temperature (RT) for an hour. the material was warmed up to 65\u00b0C in a water bath and extracted for 4 hr. water soluble materials were separated from the insoluble debris by centrifugation. a clinical isolated EV71 strain belongs to C4a cluster of the C4 subgenotype. EV71 was propagated in RD cells and CVA16 in vero cells. anti-GAPDH monoclonal antibody was purchased from Bioworld Technology. treated cells were incubated for 72 hr, followed by incubation with MTT (0.5 mg/mL) for another 4 hr. ratio of optical density (OD) at 570 nm was expressed as the survival rate of cells. CC50 was defined as concentration of extract to reduce viable cell by 50% relative to the untreated control cells. in time-of-drug addition experiment, HCT extract at 40 g/mL or MHB extract at 200 g/mL were added at time points specified in the figures. they were either added before viral adsorption, during adsorption (2 to 0 hr PI), or at varying times after viral adsorption. immunoblotting assays A buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 1% NP-40 was employed to encourage lysis of cells and to solubilize proteins. protease and phosphatase are added to prevent the digestion of the sample by its own enzymes. al cycle numbers at which the amount of amplified target reached a fixed threshold. data were emerged as fold change (2Ct) which was the amount of IL-6 mRNA, normalized to the internal control (GAPDH) the water extract was identified by comparing retention times and UV spectra with those of the markers. most of the herbs in the list are bitter or bitter-cold in nature and capable of expelling damp heat in the lung or spleen-stomach. most of the plants have been used for inflammatory and infective diseases. aria baicalensis extract started to show toxic effect at approximately 100 g/mL in vero cells with an estimated CC50 value of 240.2 g/mL. monolayers of vero cells were treated with an extract at 1000 g/mL or with an extract at a nontoxic concentration of 30 g/mL for 2 hr or remained untreated. the cells were then infected with EV71 or CVA16 (MOI = 0.2) for the cells were then infected with EV71 or CVA16. pretreatment with the extracts dose dependently blocked the cytopathic effect by those viruses. the IC50 value of HCT to block EV71 infection was estimated at 8.9 and 20.6 g/mL. crystal violet was stained with 0.5% crystal violet. the cells were photographed. the effect of drug addition on virus infection was determined at 72 hr PI. HCT directly inactivates EV71 virion, whereas MHB blocks CVA16 infection by targeting both the virion and cellular factors. EV71 in 20 L culture medium was mock-treated or treated with HCT at a concentration of 40 g/mL or MHB at 200 g/mL in a 37\u00b0C water bath. in parallel experiments, vero cells were pretreated with HCT at 40 g/mL or with MHB at 200 g/mL at 37\u00b0C for 2 hr. the drugs were replaced with fresh culture medium (cell) or left in the culture medium (plus drug) the cells were then infected with EV71 or with CVA16 at equal MOIs. the host cells with MHB reduced infectious CVA16 production by 2.1 logs and 0.9 logs. the result suggests that MHB potentially targets several steps of CVA16 infection. several flavonoids have recently been shown with strong antiviral activity against EV71 infection. hyperoside (peak 1), isoquercitrin (2), quercitrin (3), and quercetin (4) were used as standards. vero cells were pretreated with or without quercetin, quercitrin, isoquercitrin (Isoq), hyperoside (Hepe), or chlorogenic acid (Chlo) at indicated concentrations. extracts also showed inhibitory activity against TNF-induced IB degradation. cytoplasmic levels of IB proteins were determined by immunoblotting assay. vero cells were pretreated with extracts (1: EFT, 2: IIFL, 3: GJE, 5: MHB, 6: HCT, 7: IIFS, 8: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: LJT, 9: five hundred nanograms of total RNA was reverse transcribed and amplified by PCR (upper panels) or quantitative real-time PCR (lower panels) PCR products were run on a 2.0% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. results are representative of two independent experiments. herbal materials were purchased from local pharmacy stores and authenticated following methods listed in Chinese Pharmacopeia. the materials were extracted in hot water, and the water extracts were lyophilized. the extracts showed no cytotoxicity in vero cells. glycyrrhizic acid was marginally active against EV71 and CVA16 infection. further studies demonstrated that glycyrrhizic acid possessed anti-EV71 activity and anti-CVA16 activity at millimolar concentrations. activity evaluation of HCT and MHB extracts against EV71 and CVA16. the cells were pretreated with or without a herb extract at concentrations as indicated for 2 hr. the cells were then infected with EV71 or CVA16 at an MOI of 0.2 TCID50/cell or PFU/cell. the effect of drug addition on virus infection was determined at 72 hr PI. addition of HCT prior to the inoculation or during the inoculation significantly suppressed EV71 infection. the effect became less significant when added thereafter. EV71 (b) or CVA16 (c) in 20 L culture medium was mock-treated or treated with HCT at a concentration of 40 g/mL or MHB at 200 g/mL in a 37\u00b0C water bath, respectively, for 2 hr. treated samples were then added to 1.0 mL fresh culture medium and used to infect Vero cells. pretreatment of EV71, but not the host cells, with HCT abolished the infectivity of EV71 virus. in a similar experiment, we found that preincubation of CVA16 or the host cells with MHB reduced infectious CVA16 production by 2.1 logs and 0.9 logs. the result suggests that MHB potentially targets several steps of CVA16 infection. treatment with flavonoids or chlorogenic acid of HCT does not block EV71 infection. the identity of the water extract of HCT was characterized by HPLC profiling on a hypersil GOLD column. extracts from commonly used herbs for HFMD had activity in suppressing inflammatory response. EV71 and CVA16 infection promoted IB degradation at approximately 10 hr PI. the extracts also showed inhibitory activity against TNF-induced IB degradation. e, MOI = 3) for 10 hr or treated with 1 ng/mL TNF (f) for 20 min. extracts that showed no antiviral activities possessed activity against proinflammatory response to viral infection. the herb extracts inhibit EV71 or CVA16 infection induced proinflammatory response. vero cells were infected with EV71 (a) or CVA16 (b) at an MOI of 3. the total RNA was isolated by the TRIzol reagent at 16 hr PI. a water extract of Houttuynia cordata has strong activity against EV71 infection. Mentha haplocalyx has antiviral activity against CVA16. many herbs have been prescribed or recommended for the treatment of HFMD. the herbs were tested as single identity, while clinically they are used in combination or formulation containing several other herbals. Combined use of those herbs may adversely or inadversely affect the effectiveness of those materials for their antiviral and anti-inflammatory activities."}
