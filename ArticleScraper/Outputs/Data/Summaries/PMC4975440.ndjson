Thrombin-activated OPN has also been reported to inhibit the apoptosis in, or promote the survival and proliferation of, cancer cells [3]. more recently, OPN was shown to exert an intracellular function which can affect diverse cellular processes such as tumor progression [13] and interferon- production in dendritic cells [14]. this function requires the OPN protein to be appropriately cleaved, not by thrombin, but by various caspases [15] or the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 and murine plasmacytoma NS0 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 and murine plasmacytoma NS0 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin. patients and Specimens Pre-operative paired plasma and serum samples were obtained with consent from a first cohort of 33 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer. patients and Specimens Pre-operative paired plasma and serum samples were obtained with consent from a first cohort of 33 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer [27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 6 patients with adenocarcinoma. cDNA obtained from HEp-2 cells was PCR-amplified to generate DNA fragments using the following forward (F) primers and reverse (R) primers. cDNA obtained from HEp-2 cells was PCR-amplified to generate DNA fragments using the following forward (F) primers and reverse (R) primers. plasmid with insert of right orientation was recombined with the BaculoDirect linear DNA by incubation with LR clonase overnight at room temperature. low titer of virus preparation (P1 viral stock) bearing the OPN-O or OPN-P gene constructs were harvested from the spent culture supernatant at day 14\u201321 post-transfection. cytosolic extracts were prepared by incubating the infected Sf9 cells with lysis buffer (1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 1X protease inhibitor, 1 mM PMSF) the culture supernatant of HL60 (5 x 106/mL) cells with or without treatment with PMA (ng/mL) for 72 hr was harvested and concentrated 1:10 the original volume by centr the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 and murine plasmacytoma NS0 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection. the human promyelocytic leukemia cell line HL60 and murine plasmacytoma NS0 were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FCS, 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. patients and Specimens Pre-operative paired plasma and serum samples were obtained with consent from a first cohort of 33 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer. patients and Specimens Pre-operative paired plasma and serum samples were obtained with consent from a first cohort of 33 patients diagnosed with cervical cancer [27 patients with squamous cell carcinoma, 6 patients with adenocarcinoma. cDNA obtained from HEp-2 cells was PCR-amplified to generate DNA fragments using the following forward (F) primers and reverse (R) primers. cDNA obtained from HEp-2 cells was PCR-amplified to generate DNA fragments using the following forward (F) primers and reverse (R) primers. low titer of virus preparation (P1 viral stock) was harvested from the spent culture supernatant at day 14\u201321 post-transfection under ganciclovir selection. less than 10% of Sf9 cells were infected as revealed by anti-V5 antibody staining in IFA. lysates of Sf9 cells incubated with P2 viral stock without selection. culture supernatant of HL60 (5 x 106/mL) cells with or without treatment with PMA (ng/mL) for 72 hr was harvested and concentrated 1:10 the original volume by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 20 min at 4\u00b0C. spleen cells obtained from these animals were fused with NS0 myeloma cells as described. mAb 659, mAb 446 or mAb 492) were mixed with 50 L of diluted indicator antibody. bound indicator antibody was detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig. bound indicator antibody was detected by incubation with 100 L HRP-conjugated streptavidin (1:1000) for 1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C. the reaction developed using TMB; the results were read at OD 450 nm. mAb-protection study: OPN (25 ng) was pre-incubated with graded doses of mAb 659 in Tris-buffer, pH 8.0, at 4\u00b0C overnight. samples were then treated with reducing sample buffer at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, resolved on 10\u201312.5% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF membranes. mAb 659 inhibition ELISA was detected by determining the ability of the test sample to block the binding of the OPN-specific indicator antibody to the insolubilized antigen. wells of 96-well ELISA plates were coated with the different antigens (1 g/mL) at 4\u00b0C using bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.6). bound indicator antibody was detected using HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig (1:1000) (1.5 hr at 37\u00b0C) and TMB. results read at OD 450 nm in an ELISA reader. Western Blotting (WB) Recombinant proteins or Sf9 cell lysates were treated in reducing sample buffer at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, resolved on 10\u201312.5% SDS-PAGE gel. the membranes were blocked with 2.5% BSA and later incubated with the detecting mAb (mAb 659 or mAb 446) at 4\u00b0C overnight. bio-Gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Berkeley, CA) of different retention limits were prepared. these were thoroughly equilibrated with PBS (100 l) by repeated (5X) loading and subsequent centrifugation. each column was first calibrated using blue dextran and DNP-lysine. combinant OPN proteins were produced in E. coli from DNA cloned from HEp-2 cells. two GST-linked OPN fragments were obtained, one representing roughly the N-terminal half (OPN-O) and the other, the C-terminal half (OPN-P) of the protein. fusion proteins (OPN-O-V5 [*], OPN-P-V5 [#]) derived from insect cells. cell lysates were separated on 12.5% SDS-PAGE gel. ten hybridomas were produced from mice immunized against OPN-O. antigens (OPN-O-GST, OPN-P-GST, OPN-O-V5, and full-length OPN) included in ELISA results showing titration curves of individual mAbs (mAb 659, 446, and 492) against OPN-O-GST, OPN-P-GST or full-length OPN. mbin and mAb 659 monitored the result using mAb 659 in an ELISA. full-length OPN could be observed as a 72 kDa band in Western blots. this disappeared completely when the protein was pre-treated with 5 U/ml thrombin. mAb 659, mAb 446 or mAb 492 as the detecting antibody were developed to detect OPN by the ability of OPN to inhibit the binding of the mAb to the appropriate OPN substrate coated on the microplate (OPN-O-GST, OPN-P-GST, or full-length OPN) the concentration of detecting antibody used was pre-determined from the titration curve of these mAbs. mAb 659 and mAb 446 inhibition ELISA were used as inhibitors. mAb 659 was 2.7 fold more sensitive than mAb 446 in detecting the OPN produced by HL60 cells. an +/- SD, 612 +/- 106 ng/mL) in these 33 patients compared to 31 healthy subjects (409 +/- 56 ng/mL) based on sample size, this discrimination is highly significant. the assay sensitivity was 82%, and the specificity, 100%. plasma OPN levels (ng/mL) detected by the mAb 659 inhibition ELISA from a new cohort of 147 cervical cancer patients and 29 healthy subjects. this was also the case using a commercially-available test kit, human OPN Assay Kit (Immuno-Biological Laboratories Co. Ltd., Gunma, Japan) tumor tissues were available from 20 patients (4 in stage I, 6 in stage II, 10 in stage I) in this cohort which were used to determine the OPN gene expression. mAb 446 inhibition ELISA and commercial OPN kit could not detect elevated OPN levels in cancer patients. in the P60 and P100 elution, however, BSA was not excluded. but instead appeared mainly (58%) in fraction 3 and in smaller amounts in fraction 4. total exclusion of OPN activity was observed with both P10 and P30. the spread of activity in the included fractions of P60 and P100 was more limited (confined to fractions 3\u20135) the cleavage sites of caspase-8 and various metalloproteinases (MMP-3, -7, -9), the integrin binding sites (v1, v3, v5, 91 and 41) and the CD44-binding site. the sequence surrounding the thrombin-sensitive site is also shown. mAb 659, mAb 446 and mAb 492 bound specifically in an ELISA to the recombinant OPN antigen derived from both bacteria and insect cells. binding was comparable to that for the full-length OPN obtained commercially. inhibition ELISA results show mAb 659 and 446 do not cross-inhibit each other. mAb 659 recognized the evolutionary-conserved and unique thrombin-sensitive site (Arg168-Ser169) in OPN. mAb 659 binds to the thrombin-cleavage site of OPN. mAb 659 binds to the thrombin-cleavage site. mAb 659 binds to the thrombin-cleavage site of OPN. mAb 446 or mAb 492 as the detecting antibody were developed to detect OPN by the ability of OPN to inhibit the binding of the mAb to the appropriate OPN substrate coated on the microplate (OPN-O-GST, OPN-P-GST, or full-length OPN) the concentration of detecting antibody used was pre-determined from the titration curves of these mAbs. mAb 659 and mAb 446 inhibition ELISA were used as inhibitors. mAb 659 was 2.7 fold more sensitive than mAb 446 in detecting the OPN produced by HL60 cells. the cancer patients (424 +/- 121 ng/mL) had significantly higher levels of OPN than healthy subjects (314 +/- 98 ng/mL) there is good correlation (R2 = 0.71, P 0.0001) between plasma and serum OPN levels in the cervical cancer patients. mAb 446 inhibition ELISA was used in the inhibition based on plasma. there was no discrimination between the cancer and healthy groups. this was also the case using a commercially-available test kit. the mAb 446 inhibition ELISA and the commercial OPN kit could not detect elevated OPN levels in the cancer patients. the target sites for the antibodies used in these assays could be missing, whereas, by virtue of the design of the mAb 659-based assay, the thrombin-sensitive site must be present. Western blot results showed the antigen detected in individual P60 gel fractions from patients or healthy people. the plasma pooled from four cervical cancer patients was similarly fractionated. only in P10 was OPN totally excluded, with the bulk of the activity appearing in fraction 2. fraction 4 revealed an antigen of about 64 kDa in size that was present in small amounts. fraction 5 contained a marginally-smaller antigen (62 kDA) in greater abundance. fraction 6 was in turn marginally smaller in size (60 kDa) the mAb 659 inhibition ELISA results are shown by the good correlation between these results and those of the corresponding serum samples. the most severe of these, stage III-IV, showed the highest level of antigen, while the least severe, stage I, could not be distinguished from healthy individuals. the ability to detect stage I patients possibly poses the greatest challenge to all immunological assays. the inhibition ELISA we developed is the first of its kind for OPN detection. a distinct advantage of this format is the fact that the target site needs only be present in fragments or peptides as small as the site itself. a notable difference in the P30 elution profiles between the two groups was indeed found. in healthy people the bulk of the OPN antigenic activity appeared in the void fraction (fraction 2), in the cancer group, this appeared later (fraction 3)\u2014suggesting an antigen smaller in size i.e. cleaved. support for this is seen when the P60 or P100 profiles between these groups are compared. a possible candidate for the antigen found in the patients is the major fragment cleaved from whole OPN by caspase-8. this enzyme cleaves OPN at two sites, asp135 and asp 157. both could yield molecular weights greater than 40 kDa depending on the extent of post-translational modification. this is because any factor bound to OPN would have dissociated from it. the same fragment found in patients was also present in healthy people. it is not clear how intact OPN produced by other tissues becomes fragmented. OPN fragments which circulate in cancer patients may be more important than just a diagnostic (or prognostic) biomarker. they could very well determine the biology of the cancer."}
