{"summary": "retroviruses rely on recoding to overcome termination at a stop codon separating two ORFs and thereby control production of viral proteins. the retroviral pol gene lies directly downstream of the gag gene, encoding viral structural proteins. the gag ORF ends with a stop codon and translation continues into the downstream gene. the ribosome is misread as a sense codon. the amino acid glutamine is inserted at the point of normal termination. recoding in retroviruses requires the presence of a secondary structure in the viral mRNA that forms downstream of the site. the interaction mimics the rRNA conformations that allow incorporation of near and non-cognate amino acids. at higher concentrations, aminoglycosides can promote miscoding in mammalian cells. this effect is exploited in treatment of diseases caused by alleles with premature termination codons. one such compound, ataluren (formerly PTC124), has been shown to increase readthrough and has demonstrated therapeutic effects in clinical trials for treatment of muscular dystrophy and cystic fibrosis. a specific ratio of Gag:Gag\u2013Pol products is needed for proper virus replication. abnormally high production of Gag\u2013Pol protein has been shown to have negative effects on assembly and maturation of infectious particles. we tested the effect of several aminoglycosides and ataluren on readthrough of the stop codon at the MoMLV gag\u2013pol junction in human 293A cells. we transfected cells with a dual-luciferase reporter DNA (MoMLV-PK) in which the moMLV gag\u2013pol junction region containing the gag stop codon (UAG), pseudoknot and relevant flanking nucleotides was placed downstream from the coding sequences for Renill G418 had the greatest effect on readthrough, with changes of more than threefold at the highest concentrations used. ataluren and paromomycin increased the occurrence of readthrough over twofold. readthrough efficiency was determined from the ratio of luciferase activities relative to the ratio of a control construct lacking the stop codon. ataluren, 0.5 and 1 g ml 1; paromomycin, 0.5 and 1 g ml 1; gentamicin, 25 and 50 g ml 1; amikacin, 1.5 and 3 mg ml 1. increases in luciferase signal in presence of ataluren could be attributed to increased translation and not stabilization of the reporter protein. luciferase signals may be due to a general inhibition of translation, or to an increase in misreading and production of non-functional luciferase proteins. 293T cells were transfected with the moMLV-PK dual-luciferase reporter. they were treated with aminoglycosides or ataluren at two concentrations. this result suggested that the mechanism of action of ataluren is distinct from that of the aminoglycosides. culture medium from the virus-producing cells was collected 48 h after transfection. expression of firefly luciferase in the infected-cell lysates measured to gauge the amount of infectious virus produced by drug-treated cells. four compounds \u2013 G418, ataluren, amikacin and paromomycin \u2013 were tested for their effects on virus production. cells treated with G418 produced very little virus compared with virus produced in untreated cells. but the effect on virus was probably attributable to general drug toxicity on the transfected cells. reactions expressed the MoMLV gag\u2013pol junction dual-luciferase reporter. we prepared IVT reactions with reporter constructs and increasing concentrations of aminoglycosides. we measured luciferase levels generated during the reactions as before. luciferase values in IVT reactions performed with construct with a stop codon. paromomycin also caused a dose-dependent increase in readthrough of the moMLV gag\u2013pol reporter in vitro. luciferase remained relatively stable, even at high concentrations of paromomycin. means were calculated from at least three trials per concentration. Error bars represent sem of average fold changes in the various trials. luciferase values in IVT reactions performed with construct with a stop codon. readthrough of UGA had a low basal level and increased with both drugs, with a high fold increase of about 20-fold. the same stop codon drug effects were observed as in studies of non-pseudoknot drug-mediated readthrough events. readthrough of UAA was resistant to readthrough under conditions of normal translation. hypoactive pseudoknot mutant showed enhanced readthrough in IVT reactions. both drugs increased the readthrough of the mutant to a lower level than they did with the WT pseudoknot. a matched control plasmid contained a CAG-G sequence. both PTC and MoMLV reporters showed an increase in readthrough with paromomycin. the basal readthrough level of the PTC reporter was very low (0.4 %) and increased 16-fold to 6.8 % with the highest concentration of paromomycin. this was a greater fold increase for the PTC reporter than for the MoMLV gag\u2013pol junction reporter. the efficiency of readthrough was then determined by measuring the ratio of firefly luciferase to Renilla luciferase activity. to normalize levels and control for general effects on translation not related to readthrough, we performed parallel transfections of a control plasmid in which the UAG stop codon had been changed to CAG directing maximal readthrough. ataluren and paromomycin increased the occurrence of readthrough over twofold. amikacin treatment also resulted in only a slight increase in readthrough. the graph shows the mean luciferase values of triplicate readings of each condition (n = 3) ataluren has been reported to stabilize firefly luciferase and prevent its degradation. ataluren has been reported to stabilize firefly luciferase and prevent its degradation. the increase in readthrough was directly attributable to the presence of the active forms of the readthrough-promoting drugs. neomycin (neo)-resistant 293T cells contain the bacterial resistance gene neo, which encodes an aminoglycoside 3\u2032-phosphotransferase. neo-resistant 293A cells were transfected with a mixture of three DNAs. a fourth DNA, encoding Renilla luciferase, was included with the transfecting DNAs. expression of firefly luciferase in the infected-cell lysates was measured. a new tab Effects of aminoglycosides and ataluren on virus replication. producer cells were generated by transfection with plasmids expressing moMLV gag\u2013pol and VSV-G env. virus was harvested from producer cells and used to infect nave cells. paromomycin treatment had the next most significant effect on production of virus, with transduction of firefly luciferase into infected cells reduced by approximately 10-fold. ataluren treatment caused a very small decrease in virus production and transduction of firefly luciferase activity in infected cells. readthrough was increased twofold at 300 ng ml 1 but with some reduction in control reporter luciferase levels. the highest final concentration of 20 g ml 1 induced very high levels of readthrough. however, the overall translation efficiency was profoundly impaired. mean luciferase values of triplicate readings of each condition (n = 3) readthrough efficiencies attained in vitro were considerably higher than the maximum measured in vivo in 293A cells. the highest levels of paromomycin inducing a sixfold increase. the raw levels of luciferase remained relatively stable. the graph shows mean luciferase values of triplicate readings of each condition (n = 3) we also tested ataluren for effects on readthrough in vitro but were unable to observe any significant increases in readthrough. these results suggested that ataluren may act indirectly in vivo or require cellular components missing from the in vitro reactions. the same stop codon drug effects were observed as in studies of non-pseudoknot drug-mediated readthrough events. the same stop codon drug effects were observed in the context of the MoMLV gag\u2013pol junction mutants. luciferase reporter showed enhanced readthrough in IVT reactions. both drugs increased readthrough of the hypoactive pseudoknot mutant to a lower level. both drugs increased readthrough to a lower level than with the WT pseudoknot. the readthrough frequency for a no-pseudoknot PTC and for the WT MoMLV gag\u2013pol reporter was determined in the presence of increasing concentrations of paromomycin (no drug; 5 ng ml 1, 20 ng ml 1, 80 ng ml 1, 300 ng ml 1, 1.25 g ml 1, 5 g ml 1, 20 g ml 1, 20 g ml 1, 20 g ml inactivation of the drugs by modifying enzymes in drug-resistant cells prevented their ability to enhance readthrough. the aminoglycosides do interact specifically with at least one viral RNA, the RNA dimerization elements of the HIV-1 genome. this structure has no known role in recoding, but the moMLV pseudoknot has no obvious structural similarity to the HIV-1 RNA dimerization region. paromomycin had the greatest effect on virus replication with the least disruption of translation in producer cells. the structural differences responsible for the differential toxicity are not clear. both G418 and paromomycin have an OH at the 6\u2032 position of ring I. a limited survey of aminoglycoside drug effects on readthrough suggests that it may well be possible to usefully alter the rate of miscoding to reduce virus replication without cytotoxicity. the results suggest that there may be more than one point of regulation that can be altered to promote miscoding. dual-luciferase assays were performed using a Promega Dual Luciferase kit. assays were read on an Omega plate reader for a 24 s interval per well. values from each interval of firefly were summed in the Omega Mars Data Analysis program. transducing virus assay 293A cells were plated at 250 000 cells per well in six-well plates and transfected the next day with 0.5 g of a mix of three plasmids encoding components of a recombinant luciferase reporter virus. at 2 h post-transfection, the medium was replaced and supplemented with readthrough-promoting drugs.
