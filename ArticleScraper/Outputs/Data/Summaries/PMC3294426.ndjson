{"summary": "the term \u201ccytokine storm\u201d calls up vivid images of an immune system gone awry and an inflammatory response flaring out of control. however, an actual definition of what constitutes a cytokine storm is lacking. there is not a good understanding of the molecular events that precipitate a cytokine storm. previous reviews have centered on the advent of the concept (29) or its role in graft-versus-host disease (46), multiple sclerosis (89), pancreatitis (94), or multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (145). in this review, we focus on the cytokine storm in the context of infection, with particular emphasis on respiratory viruses. we will also look at the cytokine storm through the lens of genomics. major types and actions of cytokines Type Actions Interferons Regulation of innate immunity, activation of antiviral properties, antiproliferative effects Interleukins Growth and differentiation of leukocytes. many are proinflammatory Chemokines Control of chemotaxis, leukocyte recruitment; many are proinflammatory Colony-stimulating factors Stimulation of hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation Tumor necrosis factor Proinflammatory, activates type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) signal through a heterodimeric receptor complex, IFNAR1/IFNAR2. type II IFN (IFN-) signals through IFN-R1/IFN-R2. a new class of IFN with antiviral properties (127), protecting mice against influenza A virus (106). IL-1 and IL-1 are proinflammatory cytokines that mediate the host response to infection through both direct and indirect mechanisms (41) among their biological functions, these cytokines increase acute-phase signaling, trafficking of immune cells to the site of primary infection, epithelial cell activation, and secondary cytokine production. IL-1 receptor signaling is responsible for acute lung immunopathology but increases the survival of mice infected with influenza virus. the majority of chemokines are considered to be proinflammatory. they are released by a variety of cells in response to virus (or other microbial) infection. chemokine recruitment of immune cells can be highly selective for specific cell types. a mutually dependent proinflammatory cytokine network includes IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) it is thought that by functioning to increase the number of cytokine-producing macrophages at a site of inflammation, colony-stimulating factors may be part of an amplification cascade that serves to perpetuate inflammatory reactions. the name \u201ctumor necrosis factor\u201d was first used in 1975 for a cytotoxic serum factor capable of inducing tumor regression in study of rabbits with severe Pseudomonas pneumonia and systemic sepsis showed that increased TNF instilled into the lungs could pass into the systemic circulation, providing direct communication between the lungs and the bloodstream. however, many of the critical responses are likely to be far more localized in tissue. cytokines and chemokines have failed to interrogate the whole of the immune cascade in the context of the infecting pathogen and the rapidly changing immune environment in tissues. the location of the initial infection does not seem to be a determinant of the severity of local and systemic cytokine storms. bacterial, viral, and fungal products drive inflammation in the lungs via interactions with surface Toll-like receptors. a balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms is critical to maintaining lung immune homeostasis. the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms is critical to maintaining lung immune homeostasis. the balance of pro- and anti-inflammatory mechanisms is critical to maintaining lung immune homeostasis. the interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines that play a central role in innate immunity to viruses and other microbial pathogens (45, 75). they are classified into three major types (types I, II, and III) on the basis of their receptor specificity. interleukin designation was coined to refer to cytokines produced by leukocytes that function in intercellular communication. IL-1, for example, is actually a family of cytokines encoded by 11 genes (132) new interleukin designations have been proposed (40) the largest family of cytokines is the chemokines, with 44 members (and increasing) that bind to one or more of 21 G-protein-coupled receptors (33). these small secreted proteins are classified into four types (CXC, CC, C, and CX3C), depending upon the spacing of their first two cysteine residues. chemokines function as chemoattractants to control migration of cells. factor (GM-CSF), macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulate hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. colony-stimulating factors may be part of a mutually dependent proinflammatory cytokine network that includes IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) interferons (IFNs) are a family of cytokines that play a central role in innate immunity to viruses and other microbial pathogens (45, 75) they are classified into three major types (types I, II, and III) on the basis of their receptor specificity. interleukins are a diverse family of immune system regulators that function primarily in immune cell differentiation and activation. they may be either pro- or anti-inflammatory and, like all cytokines, elicit a wide variety of responses. IL-1 is actually a family of cytokines encoded by 11 genes (132) the largest family of cytokines is the chemokines, with 44 members (and increasing) that bind to one or more of 21 G-protein-coupled receptors (33). these small secreted proteins are classified into four types (CXC, CC, C, and CX3C), depending upon spacing of their first two cysteine residues. granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) stimulate hematopoietic progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation. colony-stimulating factors may be part of a mutually dependent proinflammatory cytokine network that includes IL-1 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inflammatory bowel disease, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis have not been successful. the use of TNF inhibitors for the treatment of sepsis has not been successful (49), possibly due to the early release and short circulating half-life of the cytokine. influenza viruses infect and destroy the ciliated epithelial cells of the conducting airways. bacterial, viral, and fungal products drive inflammation in the lungs via interactions with surface Toll-like receptors (TLR) and intracellular receptors. endogenous products such as oxidized phospholipids and matrix breakdown products also drive inflammation through TLR4 and probably other TLRs. mitochondrial membrane proteins and cellular ATP also implicated in driving endogenous inflammatory responses. cytokine storm pathology Inflammation associated with a cytokine storm begins at a local site and spreads throughout the body via the systemic circulation. when localized in skin or other tissue, these responses increase blood flow, enable vascular leukocytes and plasma proteins to reach extravascular sites of injury, increase local temperatures, and generate pain. pathogen-induced lung injury can progress into ALI or its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) IL-1 is a key cytokine driving proinflammatory activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with lung injury (118) intense inflammation in the lungs also can have other systemic effects on other organs. persistent hypotension, hyper- or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia, and often thrombocytopenia all cause the sepsis syndrome. cytokine storm is a consequence of severe infections in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, central nervous system, skin, joint spaces, and other sites. production of IL-10 following the onset of a cytokine storm is a marker of a counter-anti-inflammatory response. it is associated with downregulation of neutrophil and monocyte function in the systemic circulation (32, 42, 49) patients with persistent downregulation of HLA-DR (a marker of immunosuppression) on monocytes 3 to 4 days after the onset of severe sepsis and cytokine storm have a high mortality rate. gene-wide association studies have associated TLR4 polymorphisms with increased susceptibility to pathogens and severity of disease. a recent GWAS identified multiple polymorphisms in cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 (SH2) domain protein (CISH) that were associated with increased susceptibility to bacteremia, tuberculosis, and severe malaria. studies have shown increased transcriptional responses to influenza. underlying genetic variants influencing host responses that contribute toward a cytokine storm during infection. acute lung injury is a common consequence of a cytokine storm in the lung alveolar environment and systemic circulation. pathogen-induced lung injury can progress into ALI or its more severe form, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) IL-1 is a key cytokine driving proinflammatory activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of patients with lung injury. intense inflammation in the lungs also can have other systemic effects on other organs. patients with severe sepsis due to pulmonary or nonpulmonary infections show characteristic plasma cytokine profiles, which change over time. the cytokine storm is a consequence of severe infections in the gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, central nervous system, skin, joint spaces and other sites. downregulation of systemic inflammation might be conceptually beneficial in controlling systemic responses to local infections. patients who survive the initial cytokine storm but subsequently die may be those who do not recover from immunoparalysis. some individuals seem particularly susceptible, others seem relatively resistant. gene-wide association studies have associated TLR4 polymorphisms with increased susceptibility to pathogens and severity of disease. a recent GWAS identified multiple polymorphisms in cytokine-inducible SRC homology 2 domain protein (SH2) that were associated with increased susceptibility to bacteremia, tuberculosis, and severe malaria in persons in Gambia, Hong Kong, Kenya, Malawi, and Vietnam. studies have shown increased transcriptional responses associated with inflammation and antiviral immunity in mice that are more susceptible to infection. future investigations will likely reveal underlying genetic variants influencing host responses that contribute toward a cytokine storm during infection. H1N1 influenza virus, elevated levels of MCP-1 (known as CCL2), IFN--inducible IP-10 (CXCL10), MIG protein (CXCL9), and IL-8 were observed in H5N1 virus-infected patients who progressed to severe lung injury (38). the first genomic study to analyze host transcriptional responses to the 1918 pandemic influenza virus was led by Kash and colleagues. IFN signaling appears to play a critical role in restricting highly pathogenic influenza viruses to the lung microenvironment. direct comparison of transcriptional responses in infected macaques showed that these viruses induce similar IFN-regulated gene expression patterns. genes associated with inflammation were significantly differentially regulated by 1918 and H5N1 viruses. a range of proinflammatory cytokines are induced in respiratory epithelial cells. but a range of proinflammatory cytokines are induced in respiratory epithelial cells. a range of proinflammatory cytokines are induced in respiratory epithelial cells. there are several classes of cellular PRRs that activate and modulate innate immunity during infection. these include TLRs that engage LPS, molecules derived from protozoan parasites, and viral RNA products (110, 152, 153), RLRs such as RIG-I, LGP2, and MDA5. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection results in increased TLR4 expression on airway epithelial cells that sensitize cells to endotoxin by enhancing LPS-receptor engagement. a hyperresponsive TLR state represents one mechanism by which a cytokine storm can be perpetuated. pigs infected with the contemporary viruses experienced a transient, early increase in immune response concurrent with greater clinical illness. mexican isolates of SOIV showed an increase in IL-6, TNF, and IL-1 gene expression in the lungs. the upregulation of these cytokines associated with the cytokine storm likely varies between pigs and macaques. pigs mount a protective proinflammatory response without tipping the scale to promote an adverse cytokine storm. IL-1R and TNFR KO mice infected with 1918 virus showed a protective role for IL-1, while TNF exerted adverse cytokine storm effects. the transcriptional response in IL1R KO mice during acute infection is strongly associated with an increase in TNF gene expression. cytokine signaling pathway redundancy is also observed with respect to type I IFN signaling. atypical IFN-mediated immune responses suggest type I IFN signaling may be important in the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV (21). gene expression signatures for type I and type II IFN responses in the lungs of SARS patients revealed persistent expression of CXCL10, CCL2, IFNAR1, IFNGR1 and CD58. rMA15 in STAT1 knockout mice revealed increased pathology in the absence of STAT1 signaling, including evidence of pulmonary fibrotic lesions (52). Enhanced antiviral gene expression to SAR-CoV suggested alternate signaling pathways were compensating for the lack of type I IFN signaling through IFNAR, possibly Jak-STAT signaling activated by type III IFNs. k-STAT pathway are also overabundant in the acute phase. serum concentrations of IFN-, IFN-, IL-10, and TNF receptors are elevated in this early phase and remain elevated until defervescence occurs. viremia is in steep decline and serum cytokine concentrations of IFN- and IL-10 are at or near their peak levels (86). the functional phenotype of dengue virus-responsive CD8+ T cells, together with the magnitude of the T-cell response, may play a role in the development of severe disease. highly pathogenic influenza viruses aberrantly regulate cytokine and chemokine transcriptional responses, leading to a cytokine storm. extensive lung damage in mice infected with 1918 virus was accompanied by highly upregulated cytokine and chemokine gene expression. macaque bronchi showed that these viruses induce similar IFN-regulated gene expression patterns. genes associated with inflammation were significantly differentially regulated by 1918 and H5N1 viruses. a large portion of the differentially expressed inflammatory response genes were anticorrelated in gene expression. serine (or cysteine) peptidase inhibitor (Serpina1d and Serpina3a) represent acute-phase response proteins. red indicates that the gene expression is increased relative to that for the uninfected reference. green indicates that the gene expression is lower than that for the uninfected reference. RIG-I-deficient cells show reduced expression of IFN- and - genes. mice fail to produce type I IFN in response to vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), and Sendai virus infection (74). pigs infected with the contemporary viruses experienced a transient, early increase in immune response concurrent with greater clinical illness. pigs infected with the contemporary viruses experienced a transient, early increase in immune response concurrent with greater clinical illness. swine has a more controlled environment for otherwise pathogenic influenza viruses. pigs mount a protective proinflammatory response without tipping the scale to promote an adverse cytokine storm. many of the proinflammatory cytokines contributing to the cytokine storm were observed to play a protective role against 2009 influenza virus infection. transcriptional response in IL1R KO mice during acute infection is strongly associated with an increase in IFN-signaling-related antiviral gene expression. redundancy is also observed with respect to type I IFN signaling, as there is strong upregulation of IFN-stimulated gene expression. gene expression signatures for type I and type II IFN responses in lungs revealed persistent expression of CXCL10, CCL2, IFNAR1, IFNGR1 and CD58. high plasma levels of the chemokines CXCL10 and CCL2 were found in infected patients. differential chemokine expression is observed in viral lung disease caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) increased capillary permeability syndrome accounted for protein deposition in the lungs. cytokine storm in dengue virus infection is increased capillary permeability syndrome. serum concentrations of IFN-, IFN-, IL-10, and TNF receptors are elevated in this early phase and remain elevated until defervescence occurs. viremia is in steep decline and serum cytokine concentrations of IFN- and IL-10 are at or near their peak levels. phenotype of dengue virus-responsive CD8+ T cells may play a role in the development of severe disease. in patients with uncomplicated dengue, relatively more CD8+ T cells display CD107a and few express only IFN- and/or TNF. this contributes to vasodilation during this critical phase of the illness. despite efforts, none has been proved to be effective (98), and some have worsened the outcome (19) in severe malaria, an infection characterized by a powerful immunological cascade, a dozen interventions targeting the host response to infection have been tried over the last 20 years. sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor 1 suppresses cytokine and chemokine production by respiratory endothelial cells in the presence of S1P1-selective agonists. this includes production of IFN-, CCL2, IL-6, TNF-, and IFN-. some strategies dampening the immune response can correlate with increased susceptibility to infection. PPAR/PPAR agonists Gemfibrozil, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, 15d-PGJ2, ciglitazone, and troglitazone decreased production of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF cytokines. gemfibrozil targets PPAR, dampening the inflammatory response to virus-induced lung inflammation. the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors celecoxib and mesalazine increased the survival of mice infected with a highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 influenza virus (157) the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors celecoxib and mesalazine also reduced the mortality rate of mice infected with a highly pathogenic strain of the virus. adjunct therapies are likely to be complex and controlled by host and pathogen genetic determinants as well as by the immune memory of each individual. despite these efforts, none has been proved to be effective (98), and some have worsened the outcome (19) sphingosine receptors play an important role in innate immune responses (120), and sphingosine analogs have shown potential for controlling the cytokine storm caused by influenza virus (95) sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor 1 suppresses immune cell recruitment through downregulation of cytokine and chemokine production by respiratory endothelial cells. PPAR/PPAR agonists Gemfibrozil, pioglitazone, rosiglitazone, 15d-PGJ2, ciglitazone, and troglitazone decreased production of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF cytokines. PPAR- agonists downregulate the inflammatory response to virus-induced lung inflammation (8). combination therapy with zanamvir and celecoxib and mesalazine increased the survival of mice infected with a highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 influenza virus. the cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors celecoxib and mesalazine also reduced the mortality rate of mice infected with a highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 influenza virus. we know that individuals respond differently to infection and that individual responses to antibiotics and adjunct therapies also vary (141). this variation in host response is likely to be complex and controlled by host and pathogen genetic determinants as well as by the immune memory of each individual. the application of systems biology approaches to infectious disease research will offer further insight into the key cellular processes that sustain the cytokine storm or contribute to its resolution. the use of high-throughput technologies and analytical and computational modeling methods to identify and model the pathogen and host determinants."}
