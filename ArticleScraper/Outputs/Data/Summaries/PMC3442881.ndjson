{"summary": "pathogens possess strategies to avoid elimination by microbicidal mechanisms. some intracellular pathogens modify the phagosome into a permissive niche. others physically escape from this degradative compartment to establish residence in the cytoplasm. ella burnetii,24 Legionella pneumophila,25 Staphylococcus aureus,26 and Brucella abortus27 have evolved mechanisms to subvert the autophagy pathway in establishing a replicative compartment. a subset of cytosolic bacteria can re-enter LAMP1-positive vacuoles (FCVs) in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. deletion of FTT0369c in SchuS4 did not affect phagosomal escape but impaired cytosolic replication and intracellular survival. thus, we have re-named this locus dipA for deficient in intracellular proliferation A. escape-deficient mutant (SchuS4fevR)42 escaped from its original phagosome efficiently by 1 h p.i. no more than 10% was detected as cytoplasmic over a 24 h period. a fraction of SchuS4dipA bacteria were surrounded by LAMP1-positive membranes. at least 100 bacteria per experiment were scored for each condition. data are means SD from three independent experiments. 37 1.7% of SchuS4-infected BMMs contained bacteria in LAMP1-positive vacuoles at 20 h p.i., reflecting FCV formation. however, FCV formation requires bacterial replication,33. we assessed the numbers of bacteria that were sequestered in LAMP1 vacuoles. we found that only 1 1.2% of wild-type, but 34 2.5% of mutant bacteria were contained within LAMP1-positive vacuoles. this suggests that enclosure of the replication-deficient dipA mutant within endocytic vacuoles is a process distinct from FCV formation. representative confocal micrographs of MDMs infected for 20 h with either SchuS4 or its derivatives. samples were processed for immunofluorescence labeling of bacteria (green) and LAMP1-positive membranes (red) Magnified insets show single channel images of the boxed areas. the parallel intracellular trafficking among all three replication-deficient SchuS4 strains suggests that this phenomenon arises from limited bacterial proliferation within the macrophage cytosol. autophagy is a homeostatic process that directly sequesters cytoplasmic components for degradation. TEM at 20 h p.i. in BMMs revealed individual or groups of two or three replication-deficient bacteria within double-membrane structures resembling autophagosomes. thereby, replication-deficient strains are captured within vacuoles displaying autophagic features. arrows indicate bacteria enclosed within LC3-positive and LAMP1-positive vacuoles. black arrows indicate double membranes surrounding intracellular bacteria. ubiquitin-coated bacteria are delivered to autophagosomes through recruitment of autophagy adaptor proteins. a fraction of the LC3-positive bacteria did not colocalize with SQSTM1. most LC3-positive SchuS4 observed were also labeled with ubiquitin and SQSTM1 (data not shown), suggesting a similar recognition process. at least 30 LC3-positive bacteria per experiment were scored for SQSTM1 colocalization in each condition. data are means SD from three independent experiments. we also examined the recruitment of NBR1 to intracellular Francisella. however, the majority of SQSTM1-positive bacteria also recruited LC3. this indicates that wild-type Francisella interfere with autophagic cascade when targeted for autophagic capture. at least 30 ubiquitin-positive bacteria per experiment were scored for SQSTM1 recruitment in each condition. data are means SD from three independent experiments. at least 30 SQSTM1-positive bacteria per experiment were scored for LC3 recruitment in each condition. data are means SD from three independent experiments. atg5f/f-Lyz-Cre, Lc3b/ or their respective control BMMs, vacuolar recapture of replication-deficient bacteria was considerably diminished compared with control Atg5f/f BMMs. a significant reduction in the numbers of replication-deficient bacteria targeted into LAMP1 vacuoles was also observed in both Lc3b/ and Sqstm1/. untreated and bafilomycin A1 (BAF)-treated C57BL/6 BMMs share the same set of C57BL/6 controls because these experiments were done simultaneously. at least 100 bacteria per experiment were scored for each condition. 3B or SQSTM1 in infected BMMs had similar little effect on viability of intracellular bacteria at 24 h p.i.. treatment of infected BMMs with bafilomycin A1, which blocks autophagosome maturation,55 significantly reduced the numbers of replication-deficient bacteria targeted into LAMP1 vacuoles. however, autophagosome maturation into degradative autolysosomes does not constitute a significant bactericidal step 20% of wild-type and replication-deficient strains were PI-positive at 8 h p.i. the percentages of PI-positive replication-deficient bacteria ranged from 33 4.0% [SchuS4(Cm)] to 47 6.4% (dipA), indicating high numbers of damaged cytosolic bacteria that are replication deficient. cytosolic SQSTM1-positive bacteria were scored for vacuolar or cytosolic localization. at least 30 bacteria per experiment were scored for each condition. data are means SD from three independent experiments. a large fraction of replication-deficient bacteria die in the macrophage cytosol. we found that > 75% of SQSTM1-positive bacteria were cytosolic. a large fraction of replication-deficient Francisella die within the cytosol. a dipA in-frame deletion mutant (SchuS4dipA) did not show intracellular replication. the lack of replication was also associated with subsequent intracellular killing. the number of viable intracellular mutants decreased by 2-Log between 10 and 24 h pi. aining of infected BMMs for late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP1 at 20 h p.i. showed that a fraction of SchuS4dipA bacteria were surrounded by LAMP1-positive membranes. at least 100 bacteria per experiment were scored for each condition. confocal micrographs of BMMs infected for 20 h with either SchuS4 or its derivatives. samples were processed for immunofluorescence labeling of bacteria (green) and LAMP1-positive membranes (red) monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) do not support FCV formation by SchuS4.40. in MDMs, SchuS4 grew exponentially over 24 h. dipA mutant did not proliferate nor survive after 10 h p.i. infected MDMs were scored for number of bacteria enclosed within LAMP1-positive compartments. at least 100 bacteria per experiment were scored for each condition. ella strains showing similar cytosolic replication defects. ella strains displaying similar cytosolic replication defects. ella strains displaying similar cytosolic replication defects. at 20 h p.i., 11 4.0% and 13 4.5% of LAMP1-positive vacuoles containing chloramphenicol-treated SchuS4 and SchuS4purMCD were GFP-LC3-positive. a higher proportion of SchuS4dipA bacteria within LAMP1-positive vacuoles were GFP-LC3-positive. phenicol at 6 h p.i. or its isogenic purMCD or dipA mutants. at least 30 LAMP1-positive bacteria per experiment were scored for LC3 recruitment in each condition. we first examined whether the replication-deficient strains contained within LC3-positive vacuoles were labeled with ubiquitin. however, most LC3-positive SchuS4 observed were also labeled with ubiquitin and SQSTM1. at least 30 LC3-positive bacteria per experiment were scored for ubiquitin colocalization. data are means SD from three independent experiments. ND, not determined. few wild-type and replication-deficient SchuS4 were decorated with either ubiquitin or SQSTM1 at 16 h p.i. despite these low numbers, the majority of ubiquitin-coated bacteria colocalized with SQSTM1 (Fig. 5B and D), suggesting an enhanced autophagic recognition of replication-deficient bacteria. at least 100 bacteria per experiment were scored for colocalization with each marker in each condition. at least 30 ubiquitin-positive bacteria per experiment were scored for SQSTM1 recruitment. at least 100 bacteria per experiment were scored for NBR1 recruitment in each condition. data are means SD from three independent experiments. samples were processed for immunofluorescence labeling of SQSTM1 and NBR1. arrows indicate SQSTM1-positive and LC3-negative bacteria. solid white arrows indicate SQSTM1-positive bacteria enclosed within LC3-positive vacuoles. phagy-associated proteins ATG5, LC3B and the autophagy adaptor SQSTM1 depend on atg5, Lc3b and Sqstm1. at least 100 bacteria per experiment were scored for each condition. at least 100 bacteria per experiment were scored for each condition. intracellular bacteria were enumerated from CFUs at 24 h p.i. data are means SD from a representative experiment performed in triplicate out of two independent repeats. absence of ATG5 in BMMs did not restore viability of replication-deficient strains. a significant fraction of these bacteria die in the cytosol prior to autophagic capture. to test this hypothesis, we designed a fluorescence microscopy assay. the membrane-impermeant nucleic acid dye propidium iodide labels either cytosolic or all intracellular bacteria with compromised membranes as an indicator of viability. a large fraction of replication-deficient strains die in the macrophage cytosol. infected BMMs were either left untreated or treated with tetracycline at 2 h p.i. to kill cytosolic Francisella. at least 100 cytosolic bacteria per experiment were scored for PI labeling. at least 30 bacteria per experiment were scored for each condition. confocal images of BMMs infected for 16 h with either SchuS4 or its derivatives. all bacteria (blue) are detected after saponin permeabilization. a large fraction of replication-deficient Francisella die within the cytosol and are targeted to autophagy for clearance. the bacterium downregulates several genes required for nucleation and elongation of autophagy membranes during infection of human monocytes. a dipA mutant is likely deficient in dipA expression. but the purMCD mutant expressed wild-type levels of this protein. the purMCD mutant could not avoid autophagic capture. this suggests that replication deficiency leads to autophagic capture of Francisella. dipA mutant is growth-proficient in rich medium in vitro. survival defect under nutrient-limiting and stress-inducing conditions is to be examined. recruitment of the autophagy adaptors SQSTM1, CALCOCO2/NDP52, OPTN/optineurin and NBR1 remains to be examined. TECPR1 facilitates conjugation required for selective autophagy of bacterial pathogens. it is unlikely that alternative pathways involving the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol59 and the cytosolic lectin LGALS8/galectin 860 play a role in targeting replication-deficient Francisella. BR1 directly bind to LC3 via their LC3-interacting region (LIR),11,12 SchuS4 may impair such interactions to block efficient LC3 recruitment and evade targeting to autophagic membranes. further studies are necessary to confirm our observations. in-frame deletion purMCD mutant of SchuS4 A SchuS4purMCD mutant was generated using the sacB-assisted allelic replacement pJC84. a 5\u2032-fragment containing 1040 bp upstream of the start codon of purM (FTT0893), its start and the first 3 codons was generated by PCR amplification using the primers JC965 and JC966.
