{"summary": "Specimens tested for each PUI consisted of >1 of the following: upper respiratory tract sample (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens), lower respiratory tract sample (sputum and lower respiratory tract aspirates or washes), serum, or stool. time from specimen collection to receipt at CDPH was up to 48 hours. PCR for the following agents (13): influenza A and B viruses, human metapneumovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, parainfluenza virus (types 1, 2, 3, and 4), enterovirus, rhinovirus, and mycoplasma spp. the median age for MERS PUIs was 53 years (range 10 months\u201389 years) Virus detected no. patients, N = 52 % Positive Influenza only 14 27 Influenza A (H3) 10 19 Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 3 6 Influenza B 1 2 Noninfluenza only 13 25 Respiratory syncytial virus 1 2 Parainfluenza 3 2 4 Rhinovirus 3 2 4 Enterovirus 2 4 Human coronavirus 229E 2 4 Adenovirus 3 6 Co-infection 5 10 Influenza A (H3) and the high rate of influenza detection underscores the need for all travelers to be immunized for influenza.
