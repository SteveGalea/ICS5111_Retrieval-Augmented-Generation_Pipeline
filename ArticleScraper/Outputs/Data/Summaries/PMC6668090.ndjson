{"summary": "previously identified host-specific amino-acid signatures that separated avian and swine viruses from human influenza viruses. PB1\u2013216G viruses generated mutations in viral neuraminidase. PB1\u2013216G viruses were more virulent in mice than PB1\u2013216G viruses. pdmH1N1 was replaced with a high-fidelity replicase following the emergence of pdmH1N1. we think that continued surveillance of such naturally occurring PB1\u2013216 variants is warranted to assess the potential impact of changes in RdRp fidelity on the adaptability and epidemiological fitness of human influenza viruses. residue substitution at PB1\u201343 and PB1\u2013216 of influenza A viruses. residues at PB1\u2013216 of A/H1N1 viruses were examined using data."}
