{"summary": "the term zoonosis is derived from the Greek word \"zoon\" = animal and \"noso\" = disease. zoonotic diseases include viral, bacterial, fungal, protozoan and parasitic diseases shared in nature by man and animals (domestic and wildlife) zoonotic diseases can easily be transmitted to man in several ways. such persons include veterinarians, slaughterers/butchers, farmers, researchers, pet owners (e.g., through bites and/or scratches of owners of indoor pet-animals) transmission can also occur through animal vectors (e.g., tick bite, and insects like mosquitoes or flea) thousands of animals of unknown origin are sacrificed daily during pilgrimage. pilgrims slaughter over one million sheep, cows, and camels in mina to mark the successful completion of the Hajj [28], aside the 42,000 beasts slaughtered in Makkah abattoirs. zoonotic viral diseases of which eight were diagnosed on the Arabian Peninsula over the last years include rabies, rabies, influenza virus (IFV), alkhurma hemorrhagic fever, crimean-congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF), CCHF (RVF), west Nile fever (WNV) and dengue fever virus. rabies is an almost invariably fatal zoonotic disease, which belongs to the genus Lys the diagnosis of viral rabies was confirmed among 26 dogs, 10 foxes, 8 camels, and 7 cats. most cases of animal bites were caused by dogs (49.5%) and cats (26.6%), followed by mice and rats, camels, foxes, monkeys, and wolves. rabies cases among 11 dogs, 6 foxes, 6 sheep, 5 camels, 4 goats, 3 wolves, and 2 cows confirmed. rabies accounted for 24,000 to 60,000 human deaths per year. rabies accounted for 24,000 to 60,000 human deaths per year. rabies virus is a virus that can be transmitted to humans. rabies virus is not recommended for travelers from/to Saudi Arabia. rabies treatment is offered to pet dogs. rabies is considered nearly 100% fatal, but is also 100% preventable. vaccination to pets is the key element to prevent the risk of rabies zoonotic infection. reports of the epidemiology of rabies virus worldwide suggest that it is on the increase. nasopharyngeal swab, endotracheal aspirate, and serum samples confirmed infection. he died three days after admission. two studies have suggested a relationship between infection and contact with dromedary camels. the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections worldwide remains unclear. the WHO reported about 1797 cases of these infections since June 2012, with about 687 deaths in 27 different countries, worldwide. a new case involved a 71-year-old man from the city of Buraydah who later died. a new case involved a 71-year-old man from the city of Buraydah who later died. a 64-year-old man listed in critical condition and likewise had contact with camels. most cases (over 85%) reported to date have been from countries in the region (e.g., Egypt) notably from Saudi Arabia, with 1527 cases including 624 deaths. influenza type A infects both humans and animals, and causes moderate to severe illness. other types of influenza, including type B and C, infect only humans. the most recorded cases of swine influenza virus from 1979 to 1980 were in Saudi Arabia with 14,500 cases, followed by Kuwait [69], Egypt, and Oman; with less number of infected patients [68,75]. a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV), which contains inactivated antigens for two different subtypes of influenza viruses (types A and B), became available in Saudi Arabia [72]. between September 2013 and October 2014, about 406 samples were taken from several patients presenting with respiratory symptoms to King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. out of all the tested samples, 25 (6.2%) respiratory samples were positive for influenza H1N1 virus, 1 (0.25%) was positive for influenza H3N2 virus, and 7 (1.7%) were positive for influenza B virus [78]. a recent study has shown that subclinical infection in human exists. resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors has been reported to sporadically occur. resistance to oseltamivir has been widely reported since 2007, with a worldwide spread. this highlights why there is urgent need for public health system to monitor continuously via globally active influenza surveillance programs. in a recent communique, the Ministry of Environment, Water, and Agriculture for Saudi Arabia reported two cases of H5N8 avian influenza in the Kharj Governorate. positive results from samples and laboratory tests indicate 171 positive cases. several epidemic zoonotic cases of influenza H5N1 have been reported in domestic cats in several countries in Asia, Europe, the USA. a recent study has shown that the role of pets, particularly cats and dogs in the epidemic of influenza as a source of human infection seems limited. however, cats were fully susceptible to experimental infection, and infected cats were able to infect naive cats. in 2009, pandemic H1N1 infection in a domestic cat in the USA from Iowa was diagnosed by a novel PCR assay; thus, human-to-cat transmission was presumed. study suggests that severe lung infection with dry cough and severe anemia should lead to the suspicion of a secondary infection with zoonotic balantidiasis. another previous data confirmed the occurrence of Toxocara canis zoonotic infection based on respiratory symptoms reported at the pet clinics in Saudi Arabia. however, pet ownership has been growing rapidly as well as the number of pet stores among the Saudi population. blood samples were collected from household contacts of patients with laboratory-confirmed virus for follow-up testing by enzyme-linked immunosorbent serologic assay (ELISA) for AHFV-specific immunoglobulin (Ig) G. a total of 11 cases were identified through persons seeking medical care, whose illnesses met the case definition for AHFV. in humans, this zoonotic disease may present with clinical features ranging from subclinical or asymptomatic features to severe complications. it is related to Kyasanur Forest disease virus, which is localized in Karnataka, India. 233 patients confirmed with infections, 42% were butchers, shepherds, and abattoir workers. alkhurma disease resulted in meningoencephalitis and death in Wistar rats. exposures to mosquito bites are regarded as potential sources of transmissions of the disease. human-to-human transmission is documented, mostly through a form of nosocomial or in-house infection. antibodies to the virus have been detected in different animal species, as reported in 1976, in Egyptians animals\u2019 sera [119] antibodies to the virus have been detected in different animal species. survey of abattoir workers identified 40 human cases of confirmed or suspected CCHF with 12 fatalities. the virus may have been introduced to Saudi Arabia through the jeddah seaport via infected ticks on imported sheep. the highest seropositivity rate of the virus in Saudi Arabia localities was associated with animals imported from Sudan. enrolled soldiers reported symptomatic illness during deployment, 49 (25%) of whom were hospitalized. symptoms included fever (n = 81), rash (n = 50), and musculoskeletal complaints (n = 128). few studies have addressed their geographic distribution and larval habitat characteristics. study will help in monitoring potential modifications of larval habitats due to rains, global climate change, or man-made activities. RVF is not considered a major type in the arboviruses family. it has a very wide range of vectors including mosquitoes such as Aedes and Culex, flies, and often, ticks. in some cases, the impact of rainfall, soil type, water, the persistence of breeding have significant effect on vector distribution. the same virus strain was implicated in the 1997\u20131998 RVF outbreaks in Kenya and the 2000 outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen. the outbreaks in Kenya later resulted in about 89,000 human infected with about 478 patients deaths. Saudi Arabia is considered a region where RVF virus has circulated actively. zoonotic infection may be due to the consumption of unpasteurized camel milk. zoonotic infection from animal to human from the Arabian Peninsula. the first experience of DHF isolation from Saudi Arabia was recorded during an outbreak of the virus in 1994 [176], where the 289 confirmed cases reported in jeddah were caused by DENV-2 [176,177,178] during this first outbreak, in both summer and rainy season, both DENV-2 and DENV-1 were isolated. in 1997, during the rainy season in jeddah, both DENV-2 and DENV-3 were isolated. 63.4% of DHF infection cases among Saudi nationals in jeddah and Makkah city were infected with the virus. a later study puts the estimate at more than 70% of saudi nationals. this may play an important role in the development of effective eradication strategies. a study by al-Azraqi et al. was conducted in 30 hospitals and 387 primary healthcare centers in two cities in the southern province of Saudi Arabia. the study detected about 31.7% positive cases of dengue virus IgG among 965 randomly selected patients attending the outpatient clinics for any reason. the authors suggested that the virus may occur in sporadic cases in Jizan, due to the nature of the city. in the adult patients, about 98% made a full recovery without complications while two patients died. this resulted in a 50.7% reduction in the number of DHF infections among inpatient cases in jeddah, compared to the same period in the previous year. the infection was documented across the globe [199], with the exception of Antarctica [194], in various species of vertebrates, including humans, mammals, non-human primates, birds, rodents, reptiles, and amphibians. there is a high risk of the disease being introduced into Saudi Arabia. the disease is known to cause neurological disease in both humans and horses. human cases and/or animal infections with WNV including horses have also been reported in Jordan and Lebanon between 2000 and 2014. however, the reported WNV may have circulated in natural transmission cycles with close relationship to the WNV isolated from human and horses in Jordan, Lebanon, and Iran in 2000, 2010, and 2014. some zoonotic infections among camels are sometimes asymptomatic. they play a vital role in the mechanism of transmission of various diseases. there is still no extensive surveillance data regarding this disease among wildlife animals in Saudi Arabia. rabies diagnosis was confirmed among 26 dogs, 10 foxes, 8 camels, and 7 cats. most cases of animal bites were caused by dogs (49.5%) and cats (26.6%), followed by mice and rats, camels, foxes, monkeys, and wolves. among the 40 suspected rabies cases, 37 (92.5% of all cases) were found to be positive; thus confirming rabies cases among 11 dogs, 6 foxes, 6 sheep, 5 camels, 4 goats, 3 wolves, and 2 cows. in march 2018, a scientific work was reported as the first confirmed case of human rabies in Saudi Arabia from Makkah City. he was found to have leukocytosis and severe retching while attempting to drink water. the patient stated that he only received tetanus vaccine. he was administered verorab rabies vaccine and human hyperimmune rabies immunoglobulin. rabies is considered nearly 100% fatal, but is also 100% preventable. vaccination to pets is the key element to prevent the risk of rabies zoonotic infection. reports of the epidemiology of rabies virus worldwide suggest it is on the increase. a 61-year-old man with hypertension and diabetes with no history of smoking died on day 11. he was initially screened using nasopharyngeal swab, endotracheal aspirate, and serum sample for MERS-CoV per protocol with the MERS RRT-PCR assay. the results confirmed MERS-CoV infection; he died three days after admission. aryngeal swab samples from 108 live dromedary camels marketed in Abu Dhabi, united arab Emirates, showed at least two recently identified camel coronaviruses. however, limited human-to-human infections have been reported. the prevalence of MERS-CoV infections worldwide remains unclear. new cases of MERS-CoV and 2 deaths occurred on february 26. a new case involved a 71-year-old man from the city of Buraydah who later died. a new case involved a 71-year-old man in stable condition. most cases (over 85%) reported to date have been from countries in the region (e.g., Egypt) notably from Saudi Arabia, with 1527 cases including 624 deaths. influenza type A infects both humans and animals, and causes moderate to severe illness, with more likelihood of fatalities in young children and the elderly. the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of the virus in Saudi Arabia as at 30 December 2009 was 15,850, with 124 deaths. the most recorded cases then, as reported by the WHO in the Middle East, were in Saudi Arabia with 14,500 cases, followed by Kuwait [69], Egypt, and Oman. among people with certain chronic medical diseases, a trivalent influenza vaccine (TIV) became available in Saudi Arabia [72]. among elderly patients, influenza cases were higher in females than males. between September 2013 and October 2014, about 406 samples were taken from several patients presenting with respiratory symptoms to King Abdulaziz University Hospital, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. influenza drugs, antiviral agents, and current seasonal influenza vaccines are effective in reducing the incidence and severity of the disease, sickness, and/or complications. however, it is possible for widespread drug resistance against antiviral agents or vaccines to emerge in patients who extensively abused the drugs, in addition to those who have never received such treatment. in a study of 1600 pilgrims screened on arrival at the 2010 Hajj season in Saudi Arabia, 120 (7.5%) had influenza A virus (9 out of 120 had H1N1 virus) this can occur in Saudi Arabia, despite the availability of a TIV containing inactivated antigens for influenza virus types A and B, which can protect against the influenza virus infection. onotic cases of influenza H5N1 have been reported in domestic cats in several countries in Asia, Europe, the USA, and Italy [87]. a recent study has shown that the role of pets, particularly cats and dogs, in the epidemic of influenza as a source of human infection seems limited. however, cats were fully susceptible to experimental infection, and infected cats were able to infect naive cats. a previous case report confirmed a relationship between some zoonotic diseases causing respiratory symptoms, such as influenza, among pets. this study suggests that severe lung infection with dry cough and severe anemia should lead to the suspicion of a secondary infection with zoonotic balantidiasis, which infected a hamadryas baboon from Saudi Arabia. the first case was confirmed to be the butcher, following the slaughtered sheep [100]. based on evidence, the first case was confirmed to be the butcher. a study was conducted among affected patients to address this disease as a public health issue. zoonotic disease may present with clinical features ranging from subclinical or asymptomatic features to severe complications. in humans, the virus may present with clinical features ranging from subclinical or asymptomatic features to severe complications. infected patients responded to supportive care (including intravenous fluid administration and antimicrobial drugs when indicated), with no fatal cases. 233 patients confirmed with infections, 42% were butchers, shepherds, and abattoir workers. a study on infection using C57BL/6J mice cells showed that the clinical symptoms of the disease were similar to the presentations in humans. human-to-human transmission is documented, mostly through a form of nosocomial or in-house infection. antibodies to the virus have been detected in different animal species, as reported in 1976, in Egyptians animals\u2019 sera [119] antibodies to the virus have been detected in 8.8% of camels\u2019 sera and 23.1% of sheep sera. an investigation in Makkah between 1989 and 1990 identified 40 human cases of confirmed or suspected CCHF with 12 fatalities. the highest seropositivity rate of the virus in Saudi Arabia localities was associated with animals imported from Sudan [121], according to the WHO epidemiological data. a total of 197 soldiers reported symptomatic illness during deployment. a surveillance study was conducted to detect the causes of the outbreaks. the study identified 40 reactive serum samples with a combined seroprevalence of 3.9 cases/100 soldiers tested. the epidemiology of this virus in Saudi Arabia might be closely related to the ecological factors that are prevalent in humans and animals in the Arabian Peninsula. study of these factors will help in monitoring potential modifications of larval habitats due to rains, global climate change, or man-made activities. RVF is not considered a major type in the arboviruses family, which mostly are adapted to a narrow range of vectors. however, the RVF infection has a very wide range of vectors including mosquitoes such as Aedes and Culex, flies, and often, ticks. RVF epidemic has been around for more than 70 years, with infections occurring at prolonged intervals in eastern and southern Africa [158,159] the same virus strain was implicated in the 1997\u20131998 RVF outbreaks in Kenya and the 2000 outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen [130]. xans arabiensis has the potential to be an important epidemic and epizootic vector because of the tremendous number of individual mosquitoes produced after a flood. xans arabiensis has the potential to be an important epidemic and epizootic vector because of the tremendous number of individual mosquitoes produced after a flood. a single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus exists as four different serotypes (DEN-1, DEN-2, DEN-3, and DEN-4). the disease is limited to the western and southwestern regions, such as jeddah and Makkah where Aedes aegypti exists. the first experience of DHF isolation from Saudi Arabia was recorded during an outbreak of the virus in 1994. an estimated 15% of patients with DHF presented in jeddah. 63.4% of patients presenting with clinically significant virus were Saudi nationals. a later study puts the estimate at more than 70% of Saudi nationals. in the same period (2017), several countries in Asia reported about 60,000, 1877, and 738 dengue cases including deaths. in the same period (2017), several countries in Asia, including Malaysia, Singapore, and Pakistan reported about 60,000, 1877, and 738 dengue cases in Makkah. this could be due to the fact that these cities are the sites of both the annual Hajj pilgrimage and/or the minor Umrah pilgrimage. about 567 patients with a discharge diagnosis of DHF or dengue shock syndrome were identified [183] of these, 482 (85%) were adult patients within the age range 14\u201373 years, and 15% were children with age ranging from 2 months to 13 years. in the adult patients, about 98% made a full recovery without complications while two patients died [183]. the first outbreak, in 1951\u20131952, was reported in the west Nile district of Uganda [196]. this constituted a turning point in the epidemiology of the virus. it was thought to have originated from Israel following the introduction from africa. the first cases of the virus in horses was identified in the 1960s. between 2008 and 2009, a study in Iran identified WNV antibodies in horses. the results confirmed the highest activity of the virus reported in western and southern provinces with seroprevalences of up to 88% in some areas of Iran. human cases and/or animal infections with WNV including horses have also been reported in Jordan and Lebanon. some zoonotic infections among camels play a vital role in transmission of various diseases. zoonotic infections among camels are sometimes asymptomatic. there is still no extensive surveillance data regarding this disease among wildlife animals in Saudi Arabia. first country affected and year first cases recorded from Saudi Arabia. first human rabies death in the USA, 1899 2018 in Makkah [41] Saliva, CNS All mammals MERS-CoV Saudi Arabia in 2012 2012. virus detection was by serology positivity [196] CNS, tissue Horse + human Pathogens *: MERS-CoV = Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. CCHV = Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus. RVFV = Rift Valley ever virus. WNV = West Nile virus. prevention, control, and management of several zoonotic diseases usually require several important measures. having vaccination protocols for all suspected animal species by the use of up to date vaccines and compliance with the standards needed for all animals. rabies, MERS-CoV, and influenza are still being weakly addressed or neglected. pets clinics and pets stores should be considered a serious public health issue. owners of pets clinics and pets stores should be held responsible. rabies is endemic in animals in the Arabian Peninsula, with increasing numbers of reported cases form certain countries. studies about pets with different zoonotic infections from pet clinics and/or pet stores in Saudi Arabia have been rarely detected among cats, dogs, and baboons. there were also two previous reports regarding a protozoan zoonotic infection of some pets with clinical manifestation, particularly in papio hamadryas baboon. the longer quarantine periods or restriction of imported animals may be effective in reducing the introduction of zoonotic viruses. the control of vectors (e.g., ticks and mosquitoes), particularly the intermediate hosts and animal reservoirs, should be key components in the intervention strategy for zoonoses in Saudi Arabia. epidemiologic evidence should be linked with the seasonal time during the year for different zoonoses. epidemic zoonotic cases of influenza among pets has highlighted the importance of circulating influenza viruses globally. studies on drug resistance are considered to be of a high public health importance. there are suggestions and information regarding zoonoses in Saudi Arabia among the elderly, based on age and gender. zoonotic diseases could be arranged under the umbrella of social movements. this puts Saudi Arabia in the front line of threats of pandemic diseases. there is need to prevent further spread of the virus locally, regionally, and internationally. zoonotic pathogens surveillance, particularly influenza, during the Hajj season are of great importance to reduce the burden of zoonoses among localities. there is an urgent need for collaborative surveillance and intervention plans for the control of zoonotic pathogens in Saudi Arabia. a zoonotic pathogen outbreak could be dramatically decreased among the annual pilgrims. the spread could also have been due to the fact that jeddah is the main port for animal importation to Saudi Arabia. the recommendations are suggested in order to improve public awareness and/or health education of zoonotic viral diseases in Saudi Arabia. this response can draw on the availability of several studies on how to improve, control, and prevent the spread of several zoonoses in both animals and humans, worldwide. the Saudi Ministry of Agriculture could play a big role by regularly controlling the application of vaccinations and/or antibiotics on animals. veterinary regulations of animal antibiotics\u2014including overuse of drugs\u2014must be enforced to alleviate the serious public health problems."}
