{"summary": "ANDV is a zoonotic virus hosted by the long-tailed pigmy rice rat (Oligoryzomys longicaudatus) and upon transmission to humans, can cause HCPS [1,2] there is no approved vaccine or specific treatment for hantaviruses that cause HCPS, and medical intervention is largely supportive. results and discussion Hamsters vaccinated with VSVG-ANDV-GPC showed a statistically significant increase in survival when challenged with a lethal dose of ANDV. at this point, only a single vaccinated hamster developed signs of disease and was euthanized, 2 of the 6 control hamsters survived inoculation. a single dose of a vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV)-based Andes virus (ANDV) vaccine affords significant protection from ANDV disease at 6 months, but not 12 months post-vaccination. six animals per group were either mock-vaccinated or vaccinated with 200 focus forming units (FFU) of ANDV i.n. 6 months (A) or 12 months (B) after vaccination. survival was statistically evaluated using in all but two cases, neutralizing titers dropped by 6 months of vaccination. the hamster that developed disease at 6 months post-vaccination had a neutralizing titer of 80. for the surviving hamsters that were challenged at 12 months, two had titers of 40 and three had titers of 80. i.n. challenge 6 months post-vaccination challenge 12 months post-vaccination challenge 12 months post-vaccination challenge. we performed an ELISA to test whether the surviving animals were sterilely protected from ANDV at 6 and 12 months post-vaccination. andV-GPC 800 6 VSVG-ANDV-GPC 3200 18 VSVG-ANDV-GPC 3200 7 Mock NA 19 Mock 3200 8 Mock NA 20 Mock 3200 9 Mock NA 21 Mock NA 10 Mock NA 22 Mock NA 11 Mock 1600 23 Mock NA 12 Mock NA 24 Mock NA NA = Animals that did not survive challenge. vaccination with VSV-based vaccine vectors has provided potent long-term protection in other a 2-fold serial dilution of sera was mixed 1:1 with approximately 100 FFU of ANDV and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. the mixture was then used to inoculate Vero E6 cells (ATCC) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. the inoculum was then removed and 500 L of 1.2% carboxymethylcellulose in Modified Eagles Medium (MEM) containing 2.5% FBS was added analysis was performed using Prism software version 6 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) 0.05. biosafety and ethics All work with ANDV-infected hamsters and potentially infectious material was conducted in the BSL4 facility. 2-fold serial dilutions of sera were mixed 1:1 with 100 FFU of ANDV and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. the mixture was then used to inoculate Vero E6 cells (ATCC) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. the inoculum was then removed and 500 L of 1.2% carboxymethylcellulose was added to the cells and incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 hamsters with a single dose of a VSV-based ANDV vector provided long-term protection from lethal virus challenge 6 months after administration. boosting immunizations might improve the durability of this vaccine candidate."}
