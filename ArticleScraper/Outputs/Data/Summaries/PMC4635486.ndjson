{"summary": "two-thirds of the coronavirus genome encode proteins involved in viral RNA synthesis. the majority of these proteins are encoded in two 5\u2032-proximal, overlapping ORFs, ORF1a and ORF1b. the remainder of the genome encodes the virus structural proteins (S, E, M and N), as well as accessory proteins that are not essential for replication in cell culture. sRNA-binding protein (ssRBP); nsp12, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp); nsp13, helicase (Hel) and NTPase (N7-MT); nsp15, uridylate-specific endonuclease (NendoU); nsp15, uridylate-specific endonuclease (NendoU); n recombination between type 1 FCoV and canine coronavirus is relatively easy to propagate in cell culture. in the uk, about 40 % of domestic cats have been infected with FCoV. the majority of FCoV infections are asymptomatic or result in only mild enteric disease. virus undergoes mutation in the intestine or, potentially, within monocytes/macrophages. altered tropism of these mutants results in their ability to maintain effective and sustainable replication in monocytes. virulent virus mediates granulomatous phlebitis and periphlebitis. a recent study by Chang et al. (2012) provided evidence for an association between FCoV virulence and amino acid substitutions within the putative fusion peptide of the FCoV S protein. the authors demonstrated that these substitutions modulated furin cleavage and suggested that a possible consequence of the identified substitutions was an enhanced cleavability. truncating and non-truncating mutations in the ORF3c gene occur in a significant proportion of but not all FCoVs associated with FIP. however, the role of the FCoV 3c protein and any relationship to the development of FIP is still unclear. one view is that functional 3c protein expression is essential for replication in the gut but is dispensable for systemic replication. samples were of the expected size and were produced in approximately equal amounts. in comparison, there was greater heterogeneity in the amplicons obtained from RNA isolated from the FIP tissue lesions. in this context, we noted that the cycle threshold (C t) values were generally higher for faecal samples than for samples from the FIP tissue lesions. the 1 kbp DNA plus Ladder (Invitrogen) was used as molecular size markers. we were able to obtain full genome coverage, with a minimum depth of 1000 reads at each base across the coding region. it would also be possible to obtain a very high density of reads for a single genome. we only compared genome consensus sequences where each position was defined by a single nucleotide. in reality, many nucleotide positions are represented by a proportion of different nucleotides. this means that when comparing sequences, we were only able to identify mutations throughout the population of genomes. amino acid differences were located at 44 positions across an alignment of the six translatomes. at 21 of these positions, the differences fully or partially discriminated between the genomes derived from faecal and tissue lesion samples. the consensus nucleotide constituted 83 % (26M) and 55 % (27C) of the sequence reads at this position. the consensus nucleotide constituted 75 % of the sequence reads at this position. fully discriminatory differences were located at two positions where a different amino acid was found in all three FIP translatomes compared with all three non-FIP translatomes. the first was at nt 23 302 and corresponded to the methionine-to-leucine substitution identified by Chang et al. (2012). the second fully discriminatory substitution we identified resulted in an isoleucine-to-threonine substitution in the hepta cleavage at furin recognition motif may no longer be relevant to virus entry and mutations may accumulate due to a lack of selection pressure. cleavage at furin motif does not seem to be essential, at least for in vitro infectivity. the selective pressures that target the nsp3 protein are unknown. we identified a single G-to-T mutation in the 3\u2032 UTR at nt 28 926 of the consensus sequence derived from the 26M sample that was not found in any other sample. the consensus nucleotide constituted 71 % of the sequence reads at this position. the consensus nucleotide constituted 68 % of the sequence reads at this position. amplicons obtained from RNA isolated from the tissue lesions were produced in approximately equal amounts. in comparison, there was greater heterogeneity in the amplicons obtained from RNA isolated from the FIP tissue lesions. in this context, we noted that the cycle threshold (C t) values were generally higher (i.e. less viral RNA) for faecal samples. the 1 kbp DNA plus Ladder (Invitrogen) was used as molecular size markers. we were able to obtain full genome coverage, with a minimum depth of 1000 reads at each base across the coding region. the limiting step in genome sequencing from clinical samples is the production of amplicons. we only compared genome consensus sequences where each position was defined by a single nucleotide. in reality, many nucleotide positions are represented by a proportion of different nucleotides. in these cases, we took the majority nucleotide as the consensus nucleotide and did not attempt to delineate different populations in the quasispecies. genome sequences of six FCoVs derived from faecal and tissue lesion samples were translated into two polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), four structural proteins (S, M, N and E) and five accessory proteins (3s, 3b, 3c, 7a and 7b) amino acid differences were located at 44 positions across an alignment of the six translatomes. the consensus nucleotide constituted 83 % (26M) and 55 % (27C) of the sequence reads at this position. the consensus nucleotide constituted 75 % of the sequence reads at this position. the fully discriminatory differences we identified were located at two positions where a different amino acid was found in all three FIP translatomes compared with all three non-FIP translatomes. the first of these was at nt 23 302 and corresponded to the methionine-to-leucine substitution identified by Chang et al. (2012). the second fully discriminatory substitution we identified resulted in an isoleucine-to-threonine substitution in cleavage at furin recognition motif may no longer be relevant to virus entry and mutations may accumulate due to a lack of selection pressure. cleavage at furin recognition motif does not seem essential, at least for in vitro infectivity. we identified a single G-to-T mutation in the 3\u2032 UTR at nt 28 926 of the consensus sequence derived from the 26M sample that was not found in any other sample. the positions of the substitutions are indicated as the position of the relevant mutation/substitution based upon an alignment of the six FCoV genomes analysed in this study. consensus nucleotide constituted 71 % of sequence reads at this position. consensus nucleotide constituted 68 % of sequence reads at this position. consensus nucleotide constituted 59 % of sequence reads at this position. complete genome sequencing was achieved for six FCoVs using only seven primer pairs. the samples we used were collected within a few months at a single location. this means that they were less likely to have diverged compared with samples taken at different locations over a longer time period. de Groot-Mijnes et al. (2005) have already drawn attention to the relationship between the isoleucine-to-threonine substitution and enhanced virus replication in FIP cases. a different interpretation of the HR1 isoleucine-to-threonine substitution is that it may be related to the fusogenic activity of the FCoV S protein. a significant proportion (5/9) of the FIP-associated FCoVs was replaced by a tyrosine in a significant proportion (5/9) of the FIP-associated FCoVs. the comparative sequence approach taken by ourselves and others has identified a number of potentially interesting mutations in the coding sequences of non-FIP- and FIP-associated FCoVs. a number of robust reverse genetics systems available for coronaviruses in general. the pressing need is for a robust reverse genetics system that can be applied to field strains of type 1 FCoV. the bottleneck is not molecular manipulation of the FCoV genome but rather the ability to propagate type 1 FCoVs without extensive adaptation. ikingly, the virus reisolated from these cats demonstrated strong selection for a virus that reverted to encode an intact 3c protein. this is, in our view, good evidence that FIP results from an infection that involves initial replication in the gut. the further analysis of complete FCoV genomes in defined clinical samples and the development of experimental models of FIP will be needed to throw further light on this relationship. faecal samples were collected within 1 month of euthanasia of the cats with FIP. total RNA was extracted and purified from 20 mg tissue with a NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to produce a total of seven RT-PCR products (amplicons) spanning the entire coding region of the FCoV genome using the MacVector Primer3 software package. the primers were then compared with an alignment of 29 serotype 1 FCoV genome sequences. a 50 l reaction was set up on ice containing 2 l RNA, 1 l 10 M forward and 1 l 10 M reverse primer, 25 l 2 reaction mix. the oligonucleotides are given relative to the genome of FCoV C1Je. reaction was incubated at 50 \u00b0C for 50 min to allow cDNA synthesis. then raised to 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 41 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 15 s, 50\u201366 \u00b0C for 30 s and 68 \u00b0C for 1 min (kb of product size) templates were prepared from the barcoded, pooled libraries using an Ion OneTouch 2 System. a de novo consensus sequence was produced from the FASTQ reads using the Trinity assembled components and the MacVector assembly project tool. faecal samples from three healthy kittens and post-mortem tissue lesion samples were obtained from a previously reported epizootic outbreak at a single-site UK feline rescue centre. the samples were collected within 2 h of death, placed in RNAlater (Life Technologies) for 24\u201348 h at 4 \u00b0C and then stored at 80 \u00b0C. 20 mg each tissue sample was disrupted in a 2 ml tube by adding 500 l lysis buffer containing 1 % -mercaptoethanol (v/v) the sample was homogenized using a TissueLyser II (Qiagen) at 30 Hz for 2 min and 470 l lysate was added to a filter column and centrifuged for 30 s at 10 000 g. oligonucleotide primer pairs were designed to produce a total of seven RT-PCR products (amplicons) spanning the entire coding region of the FCoV genome using the MacVector Primer3 software package. primers were then compared with an alignment of 29 serotype 1 FCoV genome sequences (clustal w; sequences available upon request) a 50 l reaction was set up on ice containing 2 l RNA, 1 l 10 M forward and 1 l 10 M reverse primer, 25 l 2 reaction mix and water to a final volume of 50 l. the reaction underwent a final extension phase at 68 \u00b0C for 7 min and was held at 4 \u00b0C for 1 min. amplicon was separated on a 1 % agarose/TBE gel to confirm the PCR product size and to estimate the amount of DNA by comparison with standards. the PCR products were then pooled in approximately equimolar amounts and purified using Agencourt AmPure XP beads (Agencourt AMPure XP PCR Purification; Beckman Coulter) the same fastq sequence files were aligned with the assembled consensus sequence using Bowtie2. alignments were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) the consensus sequence reads for four samples were then aligned with the corrected 80F consensus sequence using Bowtie2. the diagnosis of FIP was confirmed by post-mortem examination. the faecal samples (65F, 67F and 80F, previously named #65, #67 and #80) were collected from healthy cats within 1 month of euthanasia. a faecal suspension was produced by vortexing 0.5 g faeces and 4.5 ml PBS five times for 30 s each. 100 l of this suspension was centrifuged for 2 min at 10 000 g. the supernatant removed and added to 350 l lysis buffer containing 1 % -mercaptoethanol. the primers were then compared with an alignment of 29 serotype 1 FCoV genome sequences (clustal w; sequences available upon request) the primers were then optimized to allow for sequence variation and compatibility of the primer pairs. a 50 l reaction was set up on ice containing 2 l RNA, 1 l 10 M forward and 1 l 10 M reverse primer, 25 l 2 reaction mix and water to a final volume of 50 l. the reaction was incubated at 50 \u00b0C for 50 min to allow cDNA synthesis, and then raised to 94 \u00b0C for 2 min. cDNA was fragmented using an Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library kit. the library was then amplified and purified using an Ion OneTouch 2 system. templates were prepared from the barcoded, pooled libraries using an Ion OneTouch 2 system. assembled genome sequences were examined and confirmed to have the expected FCoV genome architecture and predicted ORFs. for selected viral genes, the encoded protein sequences were derived and phylogenetic reconstruction was done using a neighbour-joining algorithm."}
