{"summary": "the supply of masks may not meet demand during outbreaks or pandemics of diseases that are spread by human-to-human transmission through infectious bioaerosols. in public, most people use the masks as a precaution or from a sense of panic. some health authorities have considered reusing masks after decontamination to remove any infectious material. FRs require low penetration of sodium chloride (NaCl) particles, and low resistance to the flow of air through the filter. the most frequently performed tests involve a polydispersed aerosol. the best filter should give the highest collection efficiency with the lowest pressure drop. this work compares the filter qualities of three electret masks before and after the implementation of five decontamination methods that are frequently employed in Taiwan. the comparison is based on particle penetration measurements and the pressure drop through the mask. atomizer to atomize potassium sodium tartrate tetrahydrate (PST) solutions into polydispersed droplets. the droplets were passed through a neutralizer that contained the radiation source Kr-85 (Model 3077, TSI Inc., St. Paul, MN) which neutralized them to the Boltzmann equilibrium state. flow rates were adjusted using an infrared bubble meter. data processing The penetration (P, %) was derived using the equation, P ( % ) = C d C u 100 %. test masks were placed in a laboratory chemical hood and allowed to air-dry overnight before performing the laboratory aerosol filtration test. chemical decontamination methods are frequently adopted in hospitals in Taiwan. a challenge aerosol size distribution was used with a CMD of 101 nm10 nm, and a GSD of 2.010.08. the breathing flow rate of heavy-duty workers was simulated by a calculated surface velocity of 8.3 cm s1 over the whole mask. each piece included the original layers to fit the filter holder. the newly developed evaluation method\u2014overall filter quality (qf, mm H2O-1) is obtained using the equation, q f, o ( m m H 2 O 1 ) = i = 14.6 594 q f l o g d p i (3) Statistical analysis Experimental data were analysed using SPSS software, version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) penetration of particles through mask after decontamination using IPA. Fig 6. Penetration of particles through mask after decontamination using ethanol. Electret fibrous filters are highly representative of such respirators. the major discrepancies of penetration of particles between pretreated and treated masks were discussed in the later section of MPS. the experimental MPS values of the pretreated and treated masks were 118 nm, 461 nm and 2. all of the MPS values of the pretreated masks exceeded 75 nm, and that of the Gauze masks exceeded 300nm. most of the MPS values following decontamination exceeded 300 nm. the MPS value was 346 nm for autoclave-treated masks. decontamination increased the MPS of Spunlace to more than 400 nm. p increased from 1.7 mm H2O to 16.8 mm H2O as the flow rate increased from 1.5 L min1 to 10.2 L min1. p linearly fell from 0.6 mm H2O at 1.5 L min1 to 5.9 mm H2O at 10.2 L min1. sharper slopes were obtained following treatment by a rice cooker, ethanol, bleach, and an autoclave. the flowrate through the filter influences pressure drop. calculated inspiratory breathing resistance (IBR) at 85 L min-1 [23] was 6.5, 2.6 and 0.9 mm H2O/L/sec. highest IBR value was 15.3 mm H2O/L/s for the masks submerged in bleach. pressure drop probably playing a role if inhalation resistance exceeded 35 mm H2O. all of the values of qf that were obtained in the test exceeded the calculated values. qf incorporates two variables, namely aerosol penetration and pressure drop. most of the qf ratios of the N95 masks were less than 1.0. the values of qf, o for pretreated N95, Gauze and Spunlace masks were 0.69 mm H2O1, 0.92 mm H2O1 and 1.07 mm H2O1 respectively. the pretreated Spunlace masks had the highest qf,o because they had the lowest pressure drop. the factor that most strongly influenced these results was the pressure drop, which was highest for the N95 mask. 0.98(0.91) 0.58(0.54) 0.58(0.54) PM0.1 0.82(1.00) 0.62(0.76) 0.79(0.97) 0.46(0.57) 0.48(0.59) PM0.1\u20130.6 0.25(1.00) 0.13(0.52) 0.19(0.75) 0.12(0.47) 0.10(0.38) s matched the minimum 42 CFR Part 84 criteria [10] because they had both an acceptable pressure drop and penetration. in 2011, incubation in moist heat significantly reduced the fit factor of two of the six FFRs (p 0.05) fit factors after decontamination remained 100. mask after decontamination using autoclave increased from 0.7% to 18.7% (p = 0.003) penetration of particles had little effect on masks treated with tap water or dry heat at 80\u00b0C. bleach influenced the penetration of particles through the electret masks. treatment with bleach seriously damaged the structure of the filter. decontamination increased the penetration of both 75 nm and 300 nm particles. the MPS value was 346 nm for autoclave-treated N95 masks. these results are comparable to an earlier finding condition that aerosol penetration decrease and MPS increase with decreasing face velocity (mechanical filter) p increased from 1.7 mm H2O to 16.8 mm H2O as the flow rate increased from 1.5 L min1 to 10.2 L min1. decontamination using ethanol produced similar results. comparisons were found when using rice cooker (p = 0.019) p increased from 0.2 mm H2O to 2.5 mm H2O as the flow rate rose from 1.5 L min1 to 10.2 L min1. sharper slopes were obtained following treatment by a rice cooker, ethanol, bleach, and an autoclave (p0.01) Previously reported maximum value for the normal threshold for detection of IBR was 7.6 mm H2O/L/sec. all other IBR values of treated masks ranged from 1.0\u20137.4 mm H2O/L/s. pressure drop probably playing a role if inhalation resistance exceeded 35 mm H2O (equal to 24.7 mm H2O/L/s) qf incorporates two variables, namely aerosol penetration and pressure drop. most of the qf ratios of the N95 masks were less than 1.0. pressure drop decreased when decontaminating N95 masks using the autoclave. the full range of particle sizes were 0.69 mm H2O1, 0.92 mm H2O1 and 1.07 mm H2O1 respectively. the pretreated Spunlace mask had the lowest value of qf,o for PM0.1\u20130.6. the factor that most strongly influenced these results was the pressure drop. the ratios of qf,o values ranged from 0.33 (for N95 immersed in bleach) to 0.98 (for autoclaved N95 and Gauze masks) similar results were obtained for PM0.1\u20130.6, for which the ratios ranged from 0.2 (N95 immersed in bleach) to 0.91 (Gauze mask in the rice cooker). decontamination increases the MPS, and changes the qf,o of masks. decontamination reduced the value of qf,o unless performed by using an autoclave. the calculation of qf and qf,o provides more weight on pressure drop for comparing respirator after decontamination. qf and qf,o should be used carefully."}
