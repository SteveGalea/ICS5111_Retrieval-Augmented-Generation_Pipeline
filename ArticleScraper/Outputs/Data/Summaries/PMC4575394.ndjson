{"summary": "MERS has affected more than 20 countries globally with more than 900 laboratory-confirmed cases and a fatality rate of over 30%. the epidemic has persisted for more than two years with no signs of abatement. the persistence of the epidemic may be partly due to the difficulty to control the contact between the people and dromedary camels, a major zoonotic source of MERS-CoV. a monoclonal antibody (MAb)-based capture ELISA for MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (NP) detection. rNP protein was expressed in Escherichia coli ER2566 cells. rNP protein was cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites. six-week-old mice were immunized with 100 g purified MERS-CoV-rNP emulsified in an equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. two booster immunizations using the same antigen emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant were carried out on days 14 and 28. oV 229E and HCoV-OC43 respectively subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline. incubated with mouse anti-MERS-CoV-rNP immune sera at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min. the plate was shaken for 2 min and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. 100 L of the second anti-MERS-CoV-rNP MAb 7C4 conjugated with HRP was added. detection was carried out by adding 100 L TMB per well with incubation for 10 min followed by the addition of 50 L 0.2 M H2SO4. human rhinoviruses (n = 30), human metapneumovirus (n = 10), human metapneumovirus (n = 5), HCoV-OC43 (n = 5), HCoV-229E (n = 5), and HCoV-NL63 (n = 5) were used for the evaluation of the ELISA. simulated MERS-CoV positive NPAs were prepared by adding serial dilutions (1\u2013500 000 TCID50/ the sequence coding for amino acid residues 1\u2013413 of the NP was amplified and cloned into the EcoRI and SalI sites of expression vector pET-28a(+) the rNP protein was expressed in Escherichia coli ER2566 cells and purified using Ni-NTA affinity chromatograph column. culture supernatant from individual hybridoma clones was then screened against purified MERS-CoV-rNP by ELISA. after subcloning three times by limiting dilution, stable hybridoma cells were injected into the abdominal cavity of a mouse. microplates were pre-coated with the first anti-MERS-CoV-rNP MAb 1F6. inactivated MERS-CoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, two influenza virus A strains, one influenza virus B strain and one respiratory syncytial virus strain were diluted in phosphate-buffered saline. set as 0.15+ mean value of 20 human nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) negative for influenza A, B, and C viruses, adenovirus, RSV, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20134, human rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, and HCoV-NL63. simulated MERS-CoV positive NPAs were used for the evaluation of the ELISA. the ELISA was performed using 50 L of each NPA sample. the full-length NP gene of MERS-CoV was cloned and expressed in ER2566. the MERS-CoV-rNP was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. the ELISA titer of mouse anti-MERS-CoV-rNP was coated at 100 ng/well. 1:5000 dilution of HRP conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody was used as second antibody. normal mouse sera were used as negative control. NP-specific MAbs (1F6 and 7C4) were selected. MAb 1F6 was coated onto the microplate and MAb 7C4 was conjugated with HRP. detection limit to MERS-CoV-rNP of less than 1 ng/mL. viruses 1\u20134, human rhinoviruses, human metapneumovirus, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, and MERS-CoV were 0.04. all 129 NPAs positive for various viral respiratory tract infections were negative, with mean OD SD of 0.067 0.022. cular weight of 46 kDa was purified by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography. mouse anti-MERS-CoV-rNP immune sera had good reactivity with MERS-CoV and MERS-CoV-rNP. expressed MERS-CoV-rNP has similar antigenicity to native NP of MERS-CoV. the cloning, expression, and purification procedures for HCoV-229E-rNP and HCoV-OC43-rNP were the same as described for those of MERS-CoV-rNP. the other 12 MAbs showed different degrees of cross-reactivity among the three rNP proteins, suggesting that the NPs of different CoVs might have some common epitopes. sates of two HCoVs (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-229E), two influenza A virus strains (CA/4/2009(H1N1) and Brisbane/10/2007(H3N2), one influenza B virus strain (Florida/04/2006) and one RSV strain (Figure 4B). Detection limit of anti-MERS-CoV-rNP-specific MAbs-based capture ELISA for MERS-CoV-NP. all samples with 10 TCID50/0.1 mL showed positive results. all samples with 200 TCID50/0.1 mL of live MERS-CoV added showed positive results. the antigen capture ELISA was designed using two different MAbs. half of the 24 MAbs generated showed different degrees of cross-reactivity against HCoV-229E and/or HCoV-OC43. this ELISA should be much more specific than a polyclonal antibodies-based ELISA using hyperimmune sera generated from two different kinds of animals immunized with MERS-CoV-rNP. the present assay is highly sensitive and specific for MERS-CoV. dromedaries are likely to be the immediate animal reservoir for transmission of MERS-CoV to human. high titers of antibodies to MERS-CoV have been detected in more than 95% of adult dromedaries in the Middle East. compared to quantitative real-time RT-PCR, the consumable cost of the present antigen capture ELISA is lower. it does not require expertise on molecular technology and the expensive set-up for molecular studies, which may not be present in most clinical microbiology laboratories in the Middle East."}
