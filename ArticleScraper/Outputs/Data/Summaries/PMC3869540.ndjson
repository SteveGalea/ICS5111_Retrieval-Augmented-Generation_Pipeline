{"summary": "early diagnosis is essential for the prevention and treatment of inflammatory diseases in dairy cattle. bovine haptoglobin (BoHp) has been shown to be a useful biomarker to monitor the occurrence and severity of inflammatory responses in cattle with mastitis, pneumonia, enteritis, peritonitis, endocarditis, abscesses, endometritis, interdigital dermatitis. the nucleotide sequence of the pirBoHp gene was obtained from the Genbank database available at the national center for biotechnology information website. the signal sequence of the boHp protein was predicted and analyzed using SignalP-4 software. the nucleotide sequence of the predicted immunodominant region of BoHp (pirBoHp) was synthesized based on the codon usage bias of E. coli. pirBoHp protein expression was analyzed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) the purified pirBoHp proteins were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE and then transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane using a semi-dry transfer apparatus. the NC membrane was incubated with IRDyeTM 700DX-conjugated affinity purified anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; H&L; goat; 1:8000 dilution in PBS) after washing three times with PBST, the NC membranes were analysed using the OdysseyTM Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) pirBoHp protein A pooled plasma sample from dairy cattle was used as a control. a pooled plasma sample from healthy dairy cattle was used as a control. the presence of BoHp was confirmed by Sun and colleagues. the nucleotide sequence of the predicted immunodominant region of BoHp (pirBoHp) was synthesized based on the codon usage bias of E. coli. the recombinant plasmid carrying the pirBoHp gene was designated as pMD18T-pirBoHp. recombinant plasmid pMD18T-pirBoHp was digested using the BamHI and XhoI restriction enzymes. the digested products of the pirBoHp gene and a His-tag were cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a. pirBoHp protein expression was analysed by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel membrane was incubated with IRDyeTM 700DX-conjugated affinity purified anti-mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG; H&L; goat; 1:8000 dilution in PBS) after washing three times with PBST, the NC membranes were analysed using the OdysseyTM Infrared Imaging System (Li-Cor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) the recombinant pirBoHp gene was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a. a recombinant bacterium containing the pMT1A gene was obtained by transforming the plasmid into gold strain E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. the pirBoHp gene was induced by IPTG using a final concentration of 1.0 mM. the recombinant pirBoHp protein was purified from inclusion bodies. the concentration of the purified pirBoHp protein was 0.35 mg/mL. the recombinant pirBoHp protein was purified from inclusion bodies. s MAb created a band of about 58 kDa, of which the pirBoHp protein was about 40 kDa. the pirBoHp protein was about 40 kDa and the His-tag was about 18 kDa. a pAb against the recombinant pirBoHp protein was generated in BALB/c mice. the digested pirBoHp gene was cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET-32a, which carried a His-tag. a recombinant bacterium containing the pMT1A gene was obtained by transforming the plasmid into gold strain E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells. the synthesized pirBoHp gene (58 kDa) was successfully expressed at a high level in recombinant pirBoHp protein was confirmed using an anti-His MAb. a pAb against the recombinant pirBoHp protein was generated in mice. a pAb against the recombinant pirBoHp protein could recognize the and chains of native BoHp in the pooled plasma sample. the predicted immunodominant region of BoHp (pirBoHp) was successfully expressed in E. coli cells and a pAb against the recombinant pirBoHp protein could recognize the and chains of native BoHp. the presence of rare codons and signal peptide sequences from the eukaryotic genes affect their expression in E. coli to varying degrees. cutting-gel purified proteins were dialyzed using the D-TubeTM Dialyzer. the purified pirBoHp recombinant protein showed good antigenicity via Western blot analysis and antibody preparation. the pAb against the recombinant pirBoHp protein generated in mice can recognize native BoHp proteins in plasma from dairy cattle. the recombinant protein and its antibodies have potential use for early diagnosis of many inflammatory diseases in dairy cattle."}
