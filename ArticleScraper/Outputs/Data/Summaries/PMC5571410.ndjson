{"summary": "PDCoV is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus. it belongs to the newly classified genus deltacoronavirus, in the family Coronaviridae (1\u20133). PDCoV was first reported in pig feces in the united states in 2012. a homology analysis was carried out based on the full-length genome sequence and S gene of CH/JXJGS01/2016 and the reference strains of PDCoV retrieved from GenBank. the results revealed that CH/JXJGS01/2016 had the closest relationship to and highest nucleotide identity (99.4%) with a Chinese PDCoV strain, NH (GenBank accession number KU981059). complete genome sequence of PDCoV strain CH/JXJGS01/2016 has been deposited in GenBank under the accession number KY293677."}
