{"summary": "the aim of the study was to identify the prevalence of common enteropathogens and the antibiotic sensitivity pattern in puppies reported with HGE. canine parvovirus 2b was identified in 90.3% of the diarrheic and 10% of the non-diarrheic healthy puppies. enteric viruses that are commonly detected in dogs with diarrhea include canine parvovirus (CPV), enteric canine coronavirus (CCoV) and canine distemper virus (CDV) there is a growing body of evidence indicating bacterial translocation due to impaired gastrointestinal function, leading to the septicemia in young puppies [6]. about 2 g of fecal sample and fecal swab was collected from the rectum of the affected puppies. the samples were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the common enteropathogens, including the bacteria, their toxins and viruses. 800 L of supernatant, 800 L of proteinase buffer, and 4 L of proteinase K enzyme were added and centrifuged at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 1 ml of 70% ethanol was added to the supernatant and kept at 20\u00b0C for 1 h or overnight incubation. PCR The stn gene corresponding to the Salmonella spp. was tested to show amplification with a molecular length of 617 bp [10] the stx 1 (shiga toxin) and LT 1 (enterotoxin) genes corresponding to E. coli were tested to show amplification with a molecular length of 854 bp [12]. the 16S rRNA and toxin B genes corresponding to the C agarose gel electrophoresis was visualized under ultraviolet transilluminator. the gel was visualized under ultraviolet transilluminator and documented using MEGA-CAPT software. ecal sample and fecal swab were collected from the rectum of the affected puppies. the samples were screened by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for common enteropathogens, including the bacteria, their toxins and viruses. 800 L of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol mixture and 100 L of 5 M sodium acetate were added and centrifuged at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. 1 ml of 70% ethanol was added to the supernatant and kept at 20\u00b0C for 1 h or overnight incubation. 30-50 L of nuclease free water was added to the pellet and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. PCR The stn gene corresponding to the Salmonella spp. was tested to show amplification with a molecular length of 617 bp [10] the stx 1 (shiga toxin) and LT 1 (enterotoxin) genes corresponding to E. coli were tested to show amplification with a molecular length of 854 bp [12]. the 16S rRNA and toxin B genes corresponding to the C agarose gel containing 12.5 L of master mix, 2 L of DNA template and 6.5 L of nuclease free water was taken in PCR tubes and kept on ice. gel was visualized under ultraviolet transilluminator and documented using MEGA-CAPT software. Salmonella sp., Campylobacter sp., and C. difficile toxin B, enteric CCoV and Rotavirus were found negative in 62 puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea screened samples. the fecal antibiotic sensitivity results revealed gentamicin to be sensitive in 95% of the cases, azithromycin in 50%, enrofloxacin in 25%, cefotaxime in 20%, and tetracycline in 80% of healthy non-diarrheic puppies were positive for C. difficile. a variety of 20 species of bacteria and 10 species of fungi were isolated from the rectal swabs taken from healthy dogs. Clostridium spp. and Lactobacillus spp. were least prevalent. the identification of C. perfringens in the affected puppies could be related to the intestinal dysbiosis. changes in the intestinal environment of dogs with diarrhea promote increased proliferation and transient overgrowth of enterotoxigenic strains of C. perfringens. a higher prevalence of CPV-2b among the puppies with hemorrhagic diarrhea is evident in the locality. effective vaccination program, client education, and disinfection strategies will help in reducing the incidence."}
