{"summary": "in recent years, viruses such as Ebola, Marburg, Hendra, Nipah, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus have crossed species barriers from their natural hosts into humans. experimental infections have demonstrated that specific bat species can be infected with Ebola, Marburg, SARS-CoV, Hendra, and Nipah viruses without the development of clinical symptoms. all A3 proteins contain one or two zinc-coordinating cytosine deaminase domains (Z-domains) which are required for deaminase activity. pteropid bats are species within the family Pteropodidae. pteropid bats express a diverse range of APOBEC3 Gene Products. gene expression was initially determined by searching for A3 homologues in the P. alecto transcriptome database. cDNA (complementary DNA) generated from seven A3Z1 genes, five A3Z2 genes, and a single A3Z3 gene. several A3 amino acid sequences contained Z-domains distinct from the canonical domains as defined by a specific combination of key conserved residues. pteropid bats express a more diverse repertoire of A3 mRNA than reported to date for other mammals. schematic diagrams of sequenced mammalian A3 loci depicted in white. locus positioned immediately upstream and downstream of the genes. generation of the pteropid APOBEC3 gene Locus was accomplished in step-wise manner outlined in supplementary fig. S2 online. the P. alecto A3 locus was generated by mapping P. alecto reads against the P. vampyrus A3 locus. the locus was found to be slightly shorter at approximately 188 kB as a result of multiple short 3\u201320 nt insertions and deletions. pteropid bats possess the largest A3 locus yet reported. pteropid bats possess 18 putative A3 coding domains. pteropid bats possess the largest A3 locus yet reported. the scale represents the number of amino acid substitutions per site. we tested the activity of the bat A3 proteins for which expression was verified. mutations in the rpoB gene increase with mutagenic stress mediated by A3. bat A3 proteins are functionally active and can mutate cytosines in a diverse range of dinucleotide contexts. each point represents an independent sample and bars represent median mutation frequency with numerical values above. four bat A3 proteins demonstrated a dose-dependent inhibition of HIV-1 infectivity. the sole double Z-domain bat A3 protein, A3Z2Bd-Z3, produced the largest reduction in HIV-1 infectivity. human 293 T cells were transfected with 400 ng of the HIVvif expression plasmid pIIIBvif. ancient bat retroviruses Were Hypermutated by APOBEC3 A3 activity results in positive (genomic) strand G to A mutations in endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) within host genomes. the presence of strand-biased, context-specific A3 mutagenic signatures in ERVs constitutes unambiguous evidence of a past encounter with one or more cellular A3 enzymes. Mutations in each ERV were identified by comparison against the group\u2019s common ancestor. the divergence times of the bat A3Z1 genes were estimated using a molecular clock dating analysis. analysis revealed 20 distinct A3 mRNA transcripts derived from seven A3Z1 genes, five A3Z2 genes, and a single A3Z3 gene. pteropid bats express a more diverse repertoire of A3 mRNA in humans. the pteropid bat A3 gene locus reveals the largest and most diverse known repertoire of A3 genes in mammals. the amino acid sequences of the four Z-domain subtypes are depicted from the first to the last invariant amino acid residue. the defining residue(s) are colored. yrus did not contain assembled A3 gene loci located within the boundaries of CBX6 and CBX7. however, the bat A3 cDNA could be mapped to the P. vampyrus genome. this problem was overcome by matching exons derived from sequenced cDNA, allowing the informed pairing of discontiguous scaffolds. pteropid bats possess the largest A3 locus yet reported. pteropid bats possess the largest A3 locus yet reported. pteropid bats possess the largest A3 locus yet reported. pteropid bats possess four phylogenetically distinct A3 Z-domain subtypes. two of them appear to be derivatives of the Z2 clade. bootstrap values for nodes represented in >40% of trees are shown. four bat A3Z1s showed a 10-fold or greater increase in mutation frequency. we sequenced a PCR-amplified portion of the rpoB gene known to harbor hotspots for rifampicin resistance. mutation signatures were compared against human A3B and A3G. APOBEC1; APOBEC3; AID, Activation-induced deaminase. antiviral activity of bat A3 proteins was determined by assessing the capacity of representatives of each bat A3 subtype to restrict HIV-1 infectivity. TZM-bl indicator cells were inoculated with 293 T cell culture supernatants normalized for viral particles by virion-associated RT activity. infectivity relative to HIVvif was measured by quantifying luciferase activity in TZM-bl lysates. mutagenic signatures in ERVs constitutes unambiguous evidence of a past encounter with one or more cellular A3 enzymes. a previously reported group of bat endogenous betaretroviruses was selected and a group of bat endogenous gammaretroviruses was identified in the manner described previously. guanine to adenine (G to A) versus cytosine to thymidine (C to T) mutations on the coding strand of endogenous retroviruses reveals strand-biased cytosine deamination. GG to AG and GA to AA mutations typical of human A3G are the most common mutations in endogenous retroviruses of bats. bat species studied here possess the largest and most phylogenetically diverse antiviral A3 gene repertoire of any mammal reported to date. rifampicin mutagenesis assay revealed several A3Z1 proteins as potent mediators of cytosine deamination with A3Z1 isomer B. several factors could account for inactivity within E. coli. no exogenous bat retroviruses have yet been reported. strand-biased, context-dependent, cytosine deamination of beta- and gammaretroviruses. the presence of 12 A3Z1 genes in the pteropid A3 locus is surprising. one possible reason for the observed expansion of A3Z1 genes in bats may be related to the evolution of flight. increased metabolic capacity has been linked to the evolution of sustained flight in bats. increased metabolic capacity has been linked to the evolution of sustained flight in bats. this study represents the first report of the differential evolution of an important antiviral gene family in bats relative to other mammals. the full account and explanation of the ability of bats to act as such effective hosts and transmitters of zoonotic viral pathogens will likely consist of many complex and interlinking factors beyond simple metrics such as gene numbers. the human A3 transcripts were translated into protein sequences using the CLC Genomics Workbench 8.0 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/). to identify transcripts of interest the tBLASTn function of CLC Genomics Workbench was used with following parameters: BLOSUM62 matrix, word size = 3, E-values 1 1012, gap costs of existence 11 extension 1.
