{"summary": "the document requires all 194 member states to detect, assess, notify and report any potential public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) under specific timelines. Annex 2 of the IHR outlines decision-making criteria for state-appointed national focal points to report potential PHEICs to the WHO. a major innovation of the IHR(2005) was the shift away from disease specific notification to require notification of any events that may constitute a potential \"public health emergency of international concern\" a major innovation of the IHR(2005) was the shift away from disease specific notification to require notification of any events that may constitute a potential \"public health emergency of international concern\" the IHR(2005) requires all States Parties to carry out an assessment of public health events arising in their territories using a decision instrument contained in Annex 2 of the Regulations. notification must occur if the response to two of four criteria is affirmative, or if an event constitutes any of the following. study participants consisted of national IHR Focal Points (NFPs) from WHO-reporting countries. the term \"NFP\" denotes an institution or office designated by its States Party as the WHO-communication centre for potential PHEICs. the study team developed an interview protocol focused on the study objectives. the study team tested the reliability of NFP responses by means of triangulation. telephone interviews were digitally audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. study consisted of national IHR Focal Points (NFPs) from WHO-reporting countries. the term \"NFP\" denotes an institution or office designated by its States Party as the WHO-communication centre for potential PHEICs. the guide describes NFP roles, functions and operational requirements. qualitative interviews were digitally audio-recorded, and transcribed verbatim. a qualitative research software was used to code and sort the collected qualitative data. participants were invited to voluntarily participate in the quantitative survey. national IHR Focal Point (NFP) reported access to specific types of public health event data (n = 133) human influenza caused by new sub-type 126 (94.7%) Wild-type poliomyelitis 98 (73.7%) Severe Acute Respiratory syndrome 79 (59.4%) Smallpox 60 (45.1%) Other communicable diseases 94 (70.7%) Contaminated food (i.e. substance and microbial contamination) 93 (69.9%) Contamin 93(70.5%) of NFPs reported 'excellent' or 'good' awareness of Annex 2 in health agencies. 59(46.8%) respondents 'always' use Annex 2 and 38(30.2%) indicating they 'usually' use the tool for the notification assessment of potential PHEICs. some NFPs indicated they had conducted informal trainings about Annex 2. others had developed elaborate training curricula and 'trainers of trainers' for the purpose of increasing knowledge, institutional memory and succession planning regarding Annex 2. 68(54.4%) NFPs indicated they had a formal SOP for the implementation of Annex 2 either in place or in development. in the quantitative survey, 99(74.4%) of NFPs responded that they had a domestic communications plan in place or in development to facilitate intra-country communication. NFP concerns regarding early communication Communication with WHO country and regional offices (n = 133) Yes (%) Yes (%) Early communication may unnecessarily raise alarm in my government 33 (24.8%) 20 (15.0%) Early communication may create unnecessary media attention 37 (27.8%) 33 (24.8%) Early communication may result in unnecessary media attention 24 (18.0%) 29 (21.8%) Early communication may result in unnecessary trade/travel restrictions 24 (18.0%) 2 'fully relevant' for infectious diseases, such as smallpox (114[87.7%]), SARS (110[84.0%]), and human influenza cause by a new subtype (110[84.0%]), and less relevant for communicable diseases among animals 35[27.1%], chemical contamination of products or the environment (57[44.5%]) and contaminated water (52[40.6%]) responses for qualitative and quantitative surveys varied by WHO region. the majority of NFPs reported having either excellent (30[22.9%]) or good (58[44.2%]) ability to assess potential PHEICs under the IHR's Annex 2. NFPs indicated they had 'excellent' or 'good' knowledge of Annex 2. 108(82.1%) had accessed some form of WHO training about Annex 2. 93(70.5%) of NFPs reported 'excellent' or 'good' awareness. quantitative survey revealed that 59(46.8%) respondents 'always' use Annex 2 and 38(30.2%) indicating they 'usually' use the tool for the notification assessment of potential PHEICs. many NFPs are leading trainings about Annex 2 within their countries through a range of mechanisms. 68(54.4%) NFPs indicated they had a formal SOP for the implementation of Annex 2 either in place or in development. 68(54.4%) NFPs indicated they had a formal SOP for the implementation of Annex 2. 99(74.4%) of NFPs responded that they had a domestic communications plan in place or in development to facilitate intra-country communication about public health events of potential international concern. 59(46.8%) respondents indicating they 'always' use Annex 2 and 38(30.2%) indicating they 'usually' use the tool for the notification assessment of potential PHEICs. some NFPs indicated they conducted informal trainings about Annex 2. others developed elaborate training curricula and 'trainers of trainers' for the purpose of increasing knowledge, institutional memory and succession planning. several countries indicated they had SOPs for specific locations within their territory and for certain scenarios. 68(54.4%) NFPs indicated they had a formal SOP for the implementation of Annex 2 either in place or in development. many NFPs expressed a desire to improve communication with international stakeholders including WHO. neighboring countries regarding a potential public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) NFP concerns regarding early communication Communication with WHO country and regional offices (n = 133) Yes (%) Yes (%) Early communication may unnecessarily raise alarm in my government 33 (24.8%) 20 (15.0%) Early communication may create unnecessary media attention 37 (27.8%) 33 (24.8%) Early communication may result in unnecessary trade/travel restrictions 24 (18.0%) 29 (21.8%) Early communication may result in unnecessary trade/travel restrictions 24 113(89.0%) NFPs reported that the 24-hour timeline for notification was reasonable. but 51(40.2%) NFPs require clearance from 2-3 individuals/offices prior to notification to WHO, contributing to delays in notification. the vast majority of NFPs had a strong awareness and knowledge of Annex 2. the tool was deemed useful for assessing communicable diseases, and less helpful for discerning other types of potential PHEICs. most states parties indicated they had legislation specific to the four diseases requiring automatic under the IHRs Annex 2 and had SOPs to guide use of Annex 2 in diverse settings. findings suggest cross-national management systems are in place to effectively notify WHO of potential PHEICs. x 2 was designed and written in such a way as to be intentionally non-specific. it has been assumed that this intentional ambiguity would broaden the type and numbers of notifiable events under the IHR (2005). lack of detail in Annex 2 may have allowed more discretion in reporting which in turn could have resulted in more conservative notification practices. the majority of NFPs supported the use of a centralized, web-based platform to strengthen training in the use of Annex 2 information sharing with NFPs from neighboring States Parties. syndromic surveillance system could complement existing laboratory and public health surveillance programs, and be maintained with minimal investment into technological or human resources. non-response from certain States Parties may be explained by individual circumstances (e.g. workload), cultural norms, or participant exhaustion. for those NFPs we obtained responses from, there is the risk of social desirability bias. several States Parties have demonstrated a tremendous amount of innovation. these activities to support Annex 2 may constitute 'best practices' that other States Parties can learn from and warrant closer attention. we do not know whether answers from NFPs represent views of individual risk assessors within the NFP, the entire NFP team, or a group of collaborators outside of the NFP. we noted a differential response per WHO Region, with comparatively less responses from the Eastern Mediterranean and South East Asia. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors led and implemented the independent program evaluation.
