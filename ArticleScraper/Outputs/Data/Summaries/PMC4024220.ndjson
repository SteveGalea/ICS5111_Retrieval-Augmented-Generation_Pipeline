{"summary": "the epidemiological transition begins with a fall in the death rate, mainly from acute infectious diseases of childhood. as a higher proportion of children survive to adulthood, parents choose to have smaller families, but the decline in fertility lags behind the decline in mortality. in some low- and middle-income countries, such as mexico, this transition has taken place over centuries. there were 31 million deaths from non-infectious causes (including injuries) in 1990 and 43 million in 2010 (an increase of 1.6% per year) that number is expected to rise to 83 million in 2050. growth in financial support and proliferation of health agencies have changed the business of international health beyond recognition. development assistance for health (DAH) has increased nearly fivefold, reaching at least US$27 billion in 2010. ART reduces the number of infections by 99% between 1988 and 2013, preventing paralysis in five million people and eliminating the disease from India in 2011. the global Polio Eradication Initiative cut the number of infections by 99% between 1988 and 2013, preventing paralysis in five million people and eliminating the disease from India in 2011. the 10 million HIV-positive people receiving ART in 2012 represented only two-thirds of the 15 million targeted [13]. the proportion of eligible children receiving treatment is far below target. the treatment of helminth infections is still not closely tied to improved hygiene and sanitation, which would greatly interrupt transmission. a new set of goals will put health in general, and infectious diseases in particular, in the wider context of poverty reduction and sustainable development. the transition through 2015 will bring new challenges, but also new opportunities, for infectious disease control. the transition through 2015 will bring new challenges, but also new opportunities, for infectious disease control. overweight is a risk factor for diabetes, which is also associated with a higher risk of TB. the biological basis of these interactions is not fully understood. the clinical management of TB presents an opportunity to identify people who are undernourished or who have diabetes. a growing number of older HIV-positive people on long-term antiretroviral treatment have elevated risk of metabolic, cardiac, renal, gastrointestinal, neurological and psychiatric diseases. greater longevity also underlines the question of how to prevent cancers linked to infections that have been latent for years or decades. forecasts suggest 70% of people will inhabit towns and cities by 2050 [34] infant mortality in urban and rural areas of 90 countries worldwide. most points lie above the diagonal line marking equal mortality in urban and rural areas. the comparative health advantage of urban living is revealed in lower infant mortality rates (figure 5b) the 2009 swine flu pandemic killed an estimated 280 000 people. the global influenza pandemic of 2009 has been the severest test to date. the global influenza pandemic has been the severest test to date. expanding immunization Smallpox is still the only human disease to have been eradicated by vaccination, the last case having been reported in Somalia in 1977. in the drive to eradicate certain infections, the critical question now is whether polio too can be eliminated from the last three countries where there is persistent transmission of the virus. rotavirus vaccine to prevent severe diarrhoeal disease. worldwide coverage of eight vaccines used in the Expanded Programme on Immunization, 1980\u20132012. mass immunization against meningitis A in the african Sahel would be the best way to gain maximum, immediate benefit for whole populations [23,24]. mass immunization with a new vaccine would hold great appeal, especially if it could be given both to uninfected people and to those carrying latent infections. mass vaccination would give real hope of achieving widespread TB elimination [70,71]. more than 100 million infants are vaccinated with BCG each year. more than 100 million infants are vaccinated with BCG each year. control of neglected tropical diseases contributes to reducing child mortality. a central tenet of UHC is to 'leave no one behind' after 2015, control programmes targeted against single infectious diseases will continue to be essential, not least for responding to specific and urgent problems. but in the post-2015 battle to improve public health, these focused campaigns will be fought alongside others on a broader terrain."}
