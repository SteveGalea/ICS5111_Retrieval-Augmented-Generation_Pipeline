{"summary": "neuropathic pain is an adverse consequence of traumatic spinal cord injury. it occurs in approximately 40\u201370% of patients. neuropathic pain is typically described as \u201cpins & needles,\u201d \u201cburning\u201d or \u201cpain evoked by light touch\u201d. the presence of GFAPab and/or CRMP2ab in the acute stages of injury increased the odds of developing neuropathic pain within 6 months of injury by 9.5 times. the presence of GFAPab in the acute stages of injury increased the odds of developing neuropathic pain within 6 months of injury by 9.5 times. all SCI subjects enrolled were over 18 years of age and had a traumatic, nonpenetrating SCI with deficit. chronic SCI subjects were excluded if they had a known infection at the time of, or within 30 days preceding blood sampling. chronic SCI subjects completed the Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) pain scale and the Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire as additional validation of their pain classification. the self-assessment form was administered by trained personnel who instructed subjects to consider their pain within the last week. gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting Large-format 2D gels (20 22 cm) were prepared by Kendrick Labs (Madison, WI) using cadaver brain tissue as sample source. pairs of identically prepared membranes were probed with plasma collected at 3 and 16 7 days after an SCI. each assay included positive controls consisting of a commercial anti-GFAP antibody and a validated plasma sample containing GFAPab. a negative control in which the primary antibody was not added was not added. plasma samples were diluted (1:50) and used as primary antibodies for capillary-based western analysis. to be considered autoantibody positive, plasma samples had to meet the following criteria: 1) having immunoreactivity above baseline; 2) immunoreactivity that decreased by >30% when pre-blocked with the target protein; 3) immunoreactivity was not decreased when blocked with a competing protein. rabbit anti-GFAP (antibody to GFAP) antiserum was purchased from Bethyl Laboratories. alkaline phosphatase (ALP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were obtained from Vector Laboratories. IASP has proposed a uniform classification system to define pain as nociceptive (musculoskeletal and visceral) or neuropathic (at level and below level of injury) pain documented as \u201cacute pain due to trauma\u201d was not considered neuropathic pain, nor was nociceptive pain described as musculoskeletal, visceral, or headache. 2EDTA tubes (BD) from 38 adult, acute, traumatic SCI patients at three time points. 6.4 1 days post-injury (n = 37), 16 7 days post-injury (n = 38), and 96 54 days post-injury (n = 13) the 80 chronic SCI subjects and 20 healthy volunteers provided a one-time blood sample at enrollment. blots were compared, and novel immunoreactive spots on the membranes probed with the 16-day plasma samples were identified. blots were sent for LC-MS/MS identification. capillary westerns were carried out using a WES system. plasma samples were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 160 ng of target protein (e.g., GFAP for GFAP westerns), an equimolar amount of an unrelated protein (e.g., CRMP2 for GFAP westerns), or an equal volume of resuspension solution. a two-by-two table of subjects with and without neuropathic pain at 6 months was used to calculate the odds of developing neuropathic pain. multiple logistic regression was performed controlling for age, sex, body mass index (BMI), complete injury, and cervical injury level. the plasma (1:50 dilution) of an SCI study subject was used as the primary antibody. immunoreactivity within the linear range of the assay was observed. plasma samples were pre-incubated with either GFAP or an unrelated protein. ab immunoreactivity was abolished after pre-incubation of plasma with recombinant GFAP. the commercial anti-GFAP antibody (lane 5) is shown as a positive control. a total of 80 chronic SCI subjects were consented and enrolled. HVs were positive for GFAPab (Fig. 2B; 42.5% vs. 21%; p = 0.052; 1 healthy volunteer was found to be an outlier using the Grubbs test. 1 healthy volunteer was found to be an outlier using the Grubbs test. the presence or absence of neuropathic pain in chronic SCI subjects was determined according to the clinical criteria described in the Methods section. chronic SCI patients experiencing neuropathic pain had a significantly higher S-LANSS score than those without neuropathic pain (median, 9 vs. 0; T = 741; p 0.001). GFAPab in plasma samples collected 16 7 days (n = 38) after SCI. only 4 of 19 (21%) HVs were positive for GFAPab. levels of GFAPab in acute SCI predict development of neuropathic pain. GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFAPab, autoantibodies to GFAP; SCI, spinal cord injury. of 38 acute SCI subjects, 23 (60.5%) subsequently developed neuropathic pain by 6 months after injury. age, BMI, sex, ISNCSCI/AIS, and cervical level did not differ between the pain classification groups. 58 subjects (20 healthy volunteers and 38 acute SCI) were used in study 3. Identification and prognostic accuracy of autoantibodies to collapsin response mediator protein-2. all 11 spots were excised from multiple gels and subjected to LC-MS/MS. all 11 spots were found to contain peptide fragments that mapped to CRMP2. post-translational modifications can result in changes in a protein's migration on a 2D gel. plasma (1:100 dilution) was pre-incubated with either 36 ng/uL of CRMP2 or an equimolar amount of GFAP. no immunoreactivity was detected when the primary antibody was eliminated. a strong signal was observed with the commercial CRMP2 antibody (lane 5) used as the primary antibody. 16-day plasma detected a band in the lane containing total human brain extract. but not in a lane containing CRMP2-immunodepleted brain extract. no specific immunoreactivity was observed when the plasma sample was removed as the primary antibody. a significant relationship was found between the presence of autoantibodies and the development of neuropathic pain. the presence of GFAPab and/or CRMP2ab increased the odds of developing neuropathic pain within 6 months of injury by 9.5 times. this remained significant after controlling for age, sex, BMI, complete injury, and cervical level. positive immunoreactivity was observed with the plasma of an SCI study subject. immunoreactivity within the linear range of the assay was observed. plasma (1:50 dilution) of an SCI subject was used as the primary antibody. GFAPab immunoreactivity was abolished after pre-incubation of plasma with recombinant GFAP, but not recombinant CRMP2. no immunoreactivity was detected when the primary antibody was eliminated. commercial anti-GFAP antibody (lane 5) is shown as a positive control. CI patients assayed, 34 (42.5%) were immunopositive for GFAPab. only 4 of 19 (21%) HVs were positive for GFAPab. the presence or absence of neuropathic pain in chronic SCI subjects was determined according to the clinical criteria described in the Methods section. chronic SCI patients experiencing neuropathic pain had a significantly higher S-LANSS score than those without neuropathic pain (median, 9 vs. 0; T = 741; p 0.001). we measured GFAPab in plasma samples collected 16 7 days (n = 38) after SCI. at the 16-day time point, 21 of 38 (55%) acute SCI subjects were found to be immunopositive for GFAPab. only 4 of 19 (21%) HVs were positive for GFAPab. GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; GFAPab, autoantibodies to GFAP; SCI, spinal cord injury. acute SCI subjects with neuropathic pain had higher GFAPab levels. age, BMI, sex, ISNCSCI/AIS, and cervical level did not differ. male sex 19 15 0.14 Complete (ISNCSCI A) 14 9 1.0 Cervical-level lesion 17 14 0.2 SCI, spinal cord injury; BMI, body mass index; ISNCSCI, International Standards for Neurological Classification of SCI. 58 subjects (20 healthy volunteers and 38 acute SCI) were used in study 3. all 11 spots were excised from multiple gels and subjected to LC-MS/MS. all 11 were found to contain peptide fragments that mapped to CRMP2. post-translational modifications can result in changes in a protein's migration on a 2D gel. plasma (1:100 dilution) was pre-incubated with either 36 ng/uL of CRMP2 or an equimolar amount of GFAP. no immunoreactivity was detected when the primary antibody was eliminated. a strong signal was observed with the commercial CRMP2 antibody (lane 5) used as the primary antibody. human brain total protein homogenates were subjected to immunodepletion using the commercial CRMP2 antibody. the commercial CRMP2 antibody detected a band in the lane containing total human brain extract (brain PRE) but not in a lane containing CRMP2-immunodepleted brain extract (brain FT) no specific immunoreactivity was observed when the plasma sample was removed as the primary antibody. our screening identified 24 of 38 (63%) SCI subjects that were positive for one or both autoantibodies. a significant relationship was found between the presence of autoantibodies and the development of neuropathic pain. the presence of GFAPab increased the odds of developing neuropathic pain within 6 months of injury by 9.5 times. the development of autoantibodies was not associated with ISNCSCI/AIS scores. it is plausible that in patients without these autoantibodies, insufficient amounts of GFAP or CRMP2 were released into circulation to elicit a B-cell response. after traumatic brain injury, it has been reported that GFAP can be detected in serum of patients within hours of the injury. autoantibodies to GFAP may contribute to increased blood\u2013spinal cord barrier permeability leading to persistent inflammation in the injured cord. autoantibodies to CRMP2 have been identified in retinopathy and cancer-associated retinopathy (melanoma, breast cancer and lymphoma) autoantibodies to CRMP2 may result in sprouting of neurites and axonal growth cones in neurons mediating pain, thereby enhancing pain signals. however, it is unknown whether CRMP2 levels are decreased, or its function is neutralized, in patients with CRMP2ab. a titer of 1:128 can be used to differentiate between patients who will develop neuropathic pain and those who will not. additional experiments would be required to develop a standardized, fda-approved method for assessing autoantibodies after SCI. further, it is likely that there are additional undiscovered autoantibodies."}
