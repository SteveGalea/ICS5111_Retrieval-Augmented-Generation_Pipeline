{"summary": "serotype 2 vaccine-derived poliovirus in northern Nigeria (Borno and Sokoto states) and serotype 1 wild poliovirus in northern Nigeria (Borno and sokoto states) and in Pakistan (Balochistan Province) poliovirus in pakistan, afghanistan, and afghanistan (balochistan province) is the most common type of poliovirus. polio endgame requires ending the use of OPV, to eliminate OPV-related risks. cVDPVs can emerge in areas with low immunity and behave like WPVs. risks after OPV cessation include failure to use sufficient OPV before cessation or to synchronize OPV cessation globally. if both subpopulations maintain equal coverage, then the model inputs in Table 1 would imply a theoretical threshold RI coverage with 3 OPV doses of approximately 0.92 to eliminate WPV1 transmission. the model simulates WPV1 elimination in a subpopulation as soon as the effective (ie, infectiousness-weighted) prevalence of WPV1 infections decreases below a threshold of 5 per million people (ie, the transmission threshold) subpopulations 2 1 undervaccinated subpopulation and 1 general population Initial age distribution 0\u20132 mo 0.01 Age groups of 5 y from a previously published hypothetical population were split into groups of 5\u201315 y and 15 y according to the age distribution in \u201cless developed regions excluding China\u201d [75] undervaccinated subpopulation mixes with the general population. mixing effectively reduces the force of infection in the undervaccinated subpopulation. the model assumes that routine immunization coverage in the general population remains constant at 0.95. we reviewed the remaining 12 studies and the references that they included. the insecure areas of Borno (in Nigeria) and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (in Pakistan) provide clear examples of key subpopulations of undervaccinated individuals. undervaccinated subpopulations represent a critical focus for long-term risk management. subpopulations with poor program quality may pose higher risks of cVDPVs and/or inadvertent use of OPV-containing vaccine after homotypic OPV cessation. natural disasters also disrupt systems and pose a risk for outbreaks. ted subpopulations for different serotypes in the case of polio eradication. eradication requires stopping transmission of all 3 serotypes. failure to vaccinate against all 3 serotypes consistently represented the main obstacle to interrupting transmission. the increased use of inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) will not play an important role in preventing cVDPVs in OPV-using countries prior to bOPV cessation. children with only IPV-induced protection will effectively represent a different immunological subpopulation, with additional complexity arising if the immunity derives from receipt of 1 or more fractional IPV versus full IPV doses. high-risk subpopulations represent weakest links and require significant resources. all populations must maintain high levels of immunization until global success. polio eradication mandate allows the GPEI to mobilize resources. the current global capacity for providing necessary health services in response to health system disruptions represents a resource that could disappear once the GPEI gets disbanded. the current global capacity for providing necessary health services in response to health system disruptions represents a resource that could disappear once the GPEI gets disbanded. the GPEI now faces 2 significant threats, from persistent cVDPV2 and WPV1. population immunity determines transmission, which depends on the virus finding enough unvaccinated and undervaccinated individuals to infect such that it does not die out. bOPV and no tOPV resulted in rapidly decreasing population immunity to serotype 2 transmission and unchecked spread of cVDPV2. key insight emerging from polio eradication relates to the critical need to create expectations for performance. polio eradication efforts for vaccine-preventable diseases need to create performance expectations for countries to identify and reach all people living within their borders."}
