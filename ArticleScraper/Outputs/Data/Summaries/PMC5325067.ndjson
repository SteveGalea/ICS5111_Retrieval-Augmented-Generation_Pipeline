{"summary": "to simplify infectious cycle of rabies, exposure is direct, not by environmental deposition, but rather individual-to-individual transmission, usually occurring via bite. millions of highly neurotropic virions are excreted intermittently in the saliva of a rabid host, days to weeks before overt morbidity and eventual demise. rabies is a significant disease of domestic and wild mammals alike, yet its zoonotic aspect is the cause of major historical infamy. more than 1,300 people will have been exposed to RABV. annually, tens of thousands of people will succumb, the majority children. rabies ranks within the top-ten list of neglected viral zoonoses. rabies may have a somewhat smaller presumed impact yet receive far greater attention for international support. a more holistic transdisciplinary philosophy assists in a better partial understanding of why such biomedical disparities persist between need and assistance. rabies can be prevented by vaccination and canine rabies can be eliminated by mass dog vaccination. rabies has at least three major attributes in common with those other two extinct viral pathogens. rabies has at least three major attributes in common with those other extinct viral pathogens. phylogeny, surveillance, prevention, treatment, control, and elimination, based in part upon the opinions of the authors. taxonomy, a formal attempt at objective, systematic classification and naming of entities in the complex milieu of life on earth, represented by plants, animals, and so on, extends to the microbiological arena. virions are particulate, whereas viruses are conceptual populations of microorganisms. virus species are \"polythetic classes\" in which certain agents are placed artificially on the basis of their genetic, morphological, and physio-chemical properties. ICTV is trying to underline the fact that \u201creal\u201d virions and the concept of viruses and viral species are totally different entities. two other putative lyssaviruses do not yet have taxonomic status. one is Lleida bat lyssavirus (LLEBV), identified previously by only a partial genome sequence, while isolation attempts continue 5. the other is the most recently described Gannoruwa bat lyssavirus 6. lyssaviruses have been subdivided into two phylogroups on the basis of genetic distances within their G-protein ectodomains. lyssaviruses have been subdivided into two phylogroups on the basis of genetic distances within their G-protein ectodomains. phylogroup II includes Lagos bat lyssavirus, Mokola lyssavirus, and Shimoni bat lyssavirus. the remaining West Caucasian bat lyssavirus, Ikoma lyssavirus, and Lleida bat lyssavirus are not included in either phylogroup. this demarcation is based on expert opinion of a well-qualified taxonomic study group. all phylogroup I lyssaviruses circulate in bats. only RABV is also adapted to perpetuation in carnivores. the evolutionary history of the lyssaviruses is poorly understood. an episodic diversifying selection was suggested in some studies. however, such endeavors failed to identify specific amino acid substitutions involved in host shifts with subsequent virus adaptation to a new host species. the natural history of lyssavirus speciation is set in several orders of magnitude longer. lyssaviruses were estimated to be 118 to 233 years 13 to 220 to 750 years 16, 21. an alternative approach with improved substitution saturation increased the MRCA of coronaviruses for several orders of magnitude compared with previous molecular clock estimates. this effect is as strong as, or stronger than purifying selection, which shapes virus evolution 25, 26, 27. lyssaviruses of multiple species circulate in Old World bats, but only RABV circulates in New World bats. a few lineages circulating in skunks and raccoons are paraphyletic to the RABV lineages circulating in carnivores in the Old World and to the \u201ccosmopolitan\u201d canine lineage. ancient bats are hypothesized to have spread from Africa to South America slightly later, via island hopping or direct intercontinental flight 31. at that time, bats were already infected with a progenitor of the \u201cindigenous American\u201d RABV. this virus might be well adapted to bat hosts (for example, owing to substitutions such as S 242 in the viral G protein) the absence of non-RABV lyssaviruses in the Americas can be explained at least in part by the fact that even at present these viruses have a limited geographic distribution and host ranges compared with RABV. many viruses (including multiple bat RABVs in the Old World and non-RABV lyssaviruses in the New World) became extinct during the Cretaceous-Paleocene event 65 million years ago which, as estimated, rabies is not suspected in an infected donor, organs may be transplanted from a patient that dies acutely, producing additional fatal cases in the recipients 42. rabies is not suspected in an infected donor, and organs may be transplanted from a patient that dies acutely, producing additional fatal cases in the recipients 42. the basic surveillance information needed to prevent and control what is already known about RABV and its impact on public health, agriculture, and conservation biology is more important. rabies qualifies as a vaccine-preventable disease. the majority of people at risk do not receive pre-exposure vaccination. most RABV-exposed patients are never provided adequate PEP. this discrepancy has sparked strong debate and translational research. rabies is less frequent in areas without cases for several years. unless an epizootic or enzootic status is apparent, rabies is less frequent in areas without cases for several years, assuming adequate laboratory-based surveillance. passive immunization with rabies immune globulin (RIG) becomes an even more critical part of PEP. there is no proven treatment once clinical signs appear. this presents a huge dilemma to the clinician faced with a rabies patient. vaccinated survivor after intensive medical care, coma induction, and administration of anti-viral drugs 61. few additional survivors who received the \u201cMilwaukee protocol\u201d were added to the registry. the drive to act is understandable; such undertakings are compassionate and heroic attempts at treating the incurable. a more complete approach to rabies treatment should be taken, combining insights on rabies pathobiology gleaned from both experimental animal research and individual human case studies 64. excellent clinical care by a dream team of specialists, anti-viral drugs incorporated from other RNA virus research, targeted immune modulation, the tincture of time. a healthy dose of luck for appreciable self-cure in a patient with the ideal age, genetic pre-disposition, and clinical staging parameters may target dates for the elimination of human-dog-mediated rabies were set by the WHO, the pan American Health Organization, and other international governmental organizations for Africa, Asia, and Latin America. the main components of this human rabies elimination program are control, prevention, and eventual elimination of rabies in dogs by mass immunization. overall dog vaccination coverage is estimated to be less than 20% in canine rabies-endemic countries outside of the Americas. ed dog populations, annual dog vaccine coverage and number of dog vaccine doses used per WHO region, including China (WPR). percentage of total vaccine doses applied 2020 EUR (Eurasia) 85,612,000 22% 19 24.5 EMR 26,547,000 32% 8.5 11 SEAR, without India 72,631,000 20% 14.8 19.1 India (72% rural) 38,109,000 15% 5.8 7.5 WPR, without China 38,847,000 19% 7.3 9.4 China (55% rural) 4% 70 applied to estimated rural dog population of China. 0.7 million dogs vaccinated, for. 7 million, west Africa: 2 million and rest of Africa: 2.5 million. total Africa: 12.2 million.
