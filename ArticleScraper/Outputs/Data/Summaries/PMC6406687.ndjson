{"summary": "the only known disease transmitted only through the airborne route is tuberculosis. the only known disease transmitted only through the airborne route is tuberculosis. it is difficult to assess the importance of the airborne route in disease transmission. culture on appropriate cell lines is still the gold standard to assess virus infectivity. low concentrations of viruses in the air require large air volume sampling. environment contaminants can interfere with virus or host cell growth. using animals in laboratory settings can overcome most of these challenges. the system can house three ferrets for up to 10\u201312 days. it is designed to prevent direct contact between animals. the cage system is under negative pressure, with high-efficiency particulate air filters on the air inlet and outlet for the users\u2019 and environment\u2019s protection. ports are located between the side grates and the extremities of the cages on the top, back and bottom walls of the cages. the cages are assembled together with a 7.5-mm rubber seal between cages. the distance between the grates of cages number one and two is 102 mm. the separator is composed of a stainless steel plate with 160 orifices distributed in four rows of 40 orifices. each orifice is 6.4 mm deep and 5 mm in diameter. an impaction plate is located 5 mm from the outlet of each orifice. a stabilization period of 30 min was also allowed every time the flow rate of the chamber was modified. the aerosol distribution was measured either with or without the particle separator between cages number two and three at flow rates of 200 L/min and 400 L/min. dispersed nanometer particle size was generated using a collision 6-jet nebulizer (BGI, Waltham, MA, USA), filled with 50 mL of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4, pH 7.5) the nanoScan sampled cage two for 10 min and then sampled cage three for 10 min. air samples were collected every day using NIOSH two-stage bioaerosol cyclone samplers and SKC BioSamplers. samples were eluted from two-stage bioaerosol cyclone samplers. air samples were kept frozen at 80 \u00b0C until further quantitation. the virus concentration in bioaerosol cyclone air samples was measured using qPCR. the cages are assembled together with a 7.5-mm rubber seal between cages. the distance between the grates of cages number one and two is 102 mm. the purpose of the stainless steel door is to minimize electrostatic setting of particles on the polycarbonate door. orifices are distributed in four rows of 40 orifices. each orifice is 6.4 mm deep and 5 mm in diameter. an impaction plate is located 5 mm from the outlet of each orifice. a stabilization period of 30 min was also allowed every time the flow rate of the chamber was modified. the aerosol distribution was measured either with or without the particle separator between cages number two and three at flow rates of 200 L/min and 400 L/min. nebulizer was filled with 50 mL of buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgSO4, pH 7.5) and supplied with 20 psi. nebulization was started 30 min before starting measurements to stabilize the particle concentration in the three chambers. air samples were collected every day using NIOSH two-stage bioaerosol cyclone samplers and SKC BioSamplers. air sampling started when ferrets were placed in cages after the infection from cage one. the virus concentration in bioaerosol cyclone air samples was measured using qPCR [16]. the virus concentration in BioSampler air samples was measured using plaque assays on ST6GalI-MDCK cells and embryonated chicken eggs [17]. animal procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care Committee of Universit\u00e9 Laval according to the guidelines of the Canadian Council on Animal Care (protocol 2015031). influenza A virus was detected from the index ferret (cage one) nasal wash from day 1 to days 6 or 7. nasal washes from ferrets housed in cage two were positive from days 3 or 5 in all three experiments. influenza virus genome concentrations up to 104 genomes/m3 were detected from cage two and three using the NIOSH backup filter. the D50 diameters at a chamber flow rate of 400 L/min were 5.07 0.18 m and 6.36 0.22 m with 40 and 160 open orifices, respectively, and 7.8 0.78 m at 200 L/min with 160 open orifices. data collected from two sampling ports in cage number three were used to document particle deposition at 200 L/min and 400 L/min without the particle separator. influenza virus genome concentrations up to 104 genomes/m3 were detected from cages two and three using the NIOSH backup filter. no cultivable viruses were detected from air samples using plaque assay and embryonated chicken eggs. ferrets housed in cage two were infected with influenza virus in all three experiments. this result indicates that ferrets can be infected by influenza virus carried on airborne particles emitted by influenza positive ferrets. the airborne influenza virus genome concentration was lower in cage three compared to cage two in 19 out of 20 sampling days. a chamber system can be used for airborne disease transmission studies. the system is airtight and particle size distribution through the system is satisfactory. the particle separator D50 can be modulated between 5.07 and 7.8 m by changing the airflow."}
