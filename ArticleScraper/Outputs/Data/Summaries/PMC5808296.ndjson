{"summary": "AD is the fifth-leading cause of death among those aged more than 65 years. prevalence of AD worldwide will quadruple to 114 million by 2050. etiology and pathogenesis of AD remain imprecise. oligomers of diffusible A, such as, protofibrils, prefibrillar aggregates and A-derived diffusible ligands, are the main toxic players during the development and progression of AD. many amyloid reduction therapy clinical trials have failed to provide expected clinical improvements in AD patients. these failures raise genuine concerns regarding the validity of the amyloid cascade hypothesis and the merits of further research on ART. in this review article, we discuss some of the available peptide-based therapeutics used to treat AD, the use of peptide inhibitors to target different aspects of AD. the use of peptide inhibitors to target different aspects of AD, and the use of peptides for the diagnosis and early detection of AD. findings show when ACI-80 is injected into the brain, it specifically binds to A1\u201342 and stains dense amyloid deposits in brain but not diffuse plaque. findings suggest these compounds might be useful probes for specific types of A aggregation and plaque in vivo. both peptides were tested on human A42, and C-FRHMTEQ-C a Kd value 5.45 1010 M against mouse A42. a preliminary in vivo MRI study on a transgenic mouse model of AD showed both C-FRHMTEQ-C and C-IPLPFYN-C acted as excellent contrast agents. peptide inhibitors of RGKLVFFGR (OR1) and RGKLVFFGR-NH2 (OR2) were produced by modifying the KLVFF amino acid sequence of A by incorporating RG/GR residues at its N- and C-terminals. these inhibitors were both reported to effectively inhibit A fibril formation. HKQLPFFEED A -sheet blocker peptide based on stereochemical structure and characteristic of aggregation of A (1\u201342) Lin et al. (2014) Nonhemolytic 11-residue peptide (NAVRWSLMRPF) Modified analog of NIVNVSLVK from the E-protein sequence of SARS coronavirus Ghosh et al. RR was found to have high binding affinity for A1\u201340 (Kd = 1.10 M) and its binding affinity was markedly greater than that of the known -sheet breaker peptide iA5 (Kd = 156 M; Liu et al., 2014). the effect of chiral reversal (D-enantiomers) was assessed for five peptides. it was found they inhibited A aggregation better than its L counterpart. BACE1 has characteristic bilobal structure and is a membrane-bound aspartyl protease with an open active site. it is less hydrophobic than those of other aspartic proteases and allows up to 11 substrate residues to be accommodated. BACE1 inhibition halts A formation at the first step of APP amyloidogenic processing. GAPDH can undergo diverse oxidative modifications that control its structure, function, and activity. in AD, when exposed to oxidative stress A forms amyloid-like aggregates, which reduce neuron and synapse numbers. tyrosine phosphatase (STEP) is expressed in neurons of the striatum, neocortex, hippocampus and related structures. STEP regulates various synaptic actions including glutamate receptor trafficking, which plays critical functions in learning and memory. the active motif (I/V)HCXAGXGR(S/T) is a hallmark of the PTP super-family. a neuroprotective, endogenous tripeptide GPE was reported to protect and rescue cells from A-induced death. modified analogs of GPE were synthesized and evaluated. the use of peptide-based inhibitors represents a major part of these efforts. the peptides designed function by binding to A regions critical for aggregation. the peptides designed function by binding to A to either prevent fibril formation or A elongation to prevent the formation of monomers/oligomers. FFGR-NH2 (OR2) Based on the A (16\u201320) sequence Austen et al. (2008) Fc-KLVFF Based on the A (16\u201320) sequence and conjugated with ferrocenoyl (Fc) Wei et al. (2011) KLVF-A-I-A KF-A-A-A-F Based on the A (16\u201320) sequence and Ala Wei et al. (2011) RYYAAFFARR Based on A ( i et al. (2011) reported some new peptide inhibitors based on modifications of the hydrophobic KLVFF amino acid sequence of A. they synthesized a conjugate of the pentapeptide KLVFF and ferrocenoyl (Fc) to improve the lipophilicity and proteolytic stability of peptide inhibitors. KKLVFFARRRRA, PGKLVYA and KKLVFFA were found to inhibit A aggregation better than L-peptides. observations suggested these D-peptides effectively inhibited A fibrillogenesis. two of the three were found to improve survival in transgenic C. elegans. DTGS at position 93\u201396 and DSGT at position 289\u2013292 have the ability to inhibit APP processing. BACE1 possess a catalytic domain containing a pair of aspartic acid residues at its active site. A production is blocked by BACE1 inhibition, which reduces A production by depleting C99. in plasma the concentration of GHK-Cu is about 200 ng/ml (107 M1) at age 20, but decreases to 80 ng/ml at age 60. selective HDAC inhibitors have been shown to possess neuroprotective properties in animal models of brain disease. STEP regulates various synaptic actions including glutamate receptor trafficking. it was recently suggested STEP is overactive in AD and schizophrenia. a neuroprotective, endogenous tripeptide GPE was reported to protect and rescue cells from A-induced death. Based Inhibitors Against Potassium Channel KV1.3 was recently identified as a potential target in AD. the study found Kv1.3 overexpression in the frontal cortices of AD patients. this suggests potassium channel KV1.3 to consider a therapeutic target in AD."}
