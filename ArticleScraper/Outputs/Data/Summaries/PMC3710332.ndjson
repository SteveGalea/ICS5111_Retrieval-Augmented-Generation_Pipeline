{"summary": "the pandemic influenza virus of 1918\u20131919 swept through America, Europe, Asia, and Africa smashing the globe. in the last decades emerging and re-emerging epidemics such as AIDS, measles, malaria, and tuberculosis cause death to millions of people each year. the global surveillance network is growing under an intensive worldwide effort. the problem stems from two reasons: the continuous and ever-lasting mutations of the viruses and (2) the complexity in the disease transmission mechanism. the odds are that in a real crisis, even if researchers succeed to come up with a vaccine tailor-made for an emerged virus strain, it is doubtful that it would stop a pandemic. a review of this work can be found in Sally Blower (2004). a revision of the main findings and a presentation of the criticism by D\u2019Alembert appears in Dietz and Heesterbeek (2002). a revision of the main findings and a presentation of the criticism by D\u2019Alembert appears in Dietz and Heesterbeek (2002). mathematical models for the dynamics and the control of mosquito-transmitted pathogens are known as Ross\u2013MacDonald models. the model is the precursor of the famous Reed-Frost chain binomial model introduced by W. H. Frost in 1928 in biostatistics lectures at Johns Hopkins University. Statistical-Based Methods for Epidemic Surveillance One of the most important aspects in epidemics revolves around the surveillance, early detection of possible outbreaks and patterns that may help controlling a spread. in the dawn of 20th century Greenwood an epidemiologist and statistician was the first Professor of epidemiology and statistics at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Diseases establishing a rigorous mathematical connection between fields. y(t) was the expected mean value of total deaths due to pneumonia and influenza in units of 4-weeks periods. y(t) was the expected mean value of total deaths due to pneumonia and influenza in units of 4-weeks periods. assumptions on the statistical properties (for example independence, normal distribution and fixed variance) of the unmodeled dynamics flash a \u201cnote of caution\u201d in their use especially for the surveillance and prediction of outbreaks. the Akaike Information Criterion35 is usually applied to identify the optimal model order by compromising between the goodness-of-fit and number of parameters. the fitted model is then used for the forecasting of disease evolution. the reliability of such approaches is limited mostly by statistical uncertainty. z(t0) z(0) = 0, i 1 is a \u201cforgetting\u201d factor, a number between 0 and 1 which weights the significance of past values. z(t0) z(0) = 0, i 1 is a number between 0 and 1 which weights the significance of past observed information in estimating future. the transition probability between an observed, say oj(.) and a hidden state, say yi(.) is defined as,, j = 1, 2,..., n. the first problem is usually tackled with the forward-backward algorithm. the software is based on the spatial scan statistic71,72 and the Bernoulli spatial model. they used regression analysis on the larger scale and kriging68 to interpolate count data at an unobserved location. y(t) was the expected mean value of total deaths due to pneumonia and influenza in units of 4-weeks periods. the model was fitted using data from 108 US cities for a 3 year period starting in September of 1955. independent factors (variables) that determine its spread flash a \u201cnote of caution\u201d in their use especially for surveillance and prediction of outbreaks of new emerging epidemics. in this category, ARIMA models are the most commonly used. the Akaike Information Criterion35 is usually applied to identify the optimal model order by compromising between the goodness-of-fit and number of parameters. the fitted model is then used for the forecasting of disease evolution. the reliability of such approaches is limited mostly by statistical uncertainty related to the estimation of the values of the unknown parameters. the probability functions f(0) and f(1) and their parameters can be estimated using data from past periods. for an epidemic that involves time-varying characteristics, such as seasonality, the reference parameter is now time-varying itself, i.e., k k(t). the EWMA control chart method monitors infectious disease dynamics using the following recursive statistical estimator. the transition probability between an observed, say oj(.) and a hidden state, say yi(.) is defined as,, j = 1, 2,..., n. the first problem is usually tackled with the forward-backward algorithm. multivariate methods can be viewed as extensions of standard univariate methods. others such as clustering, principal component analysis (PCA) based methods do not have a common ancestor with univariate ones. Continuum models describe the coarse-grained dynamics of the epidemics in the population. 80-84 such models are used to quantify the relation of demographic variables (such as age, gender, social status, spatial characteristics) on the survival rates, i.e., death or infection. a and 1/ denote mean values of the disease transmission probability and length of the period for which an individual can transmit the disease before recovering. in the Kermack and McKendrick model, the disease becomes epidemic, i.e., if and only if. at the number of infected cases reach a maximum and after this it decreases to zero. coburn et al. (2010) give a review on simulating influenza including swine flu (H1N1) with SIR models. correia et al. (2010) used a SIR model to study the measles and hepatitis C in Portugal using data from 1996 until 2007.99 SIR-type models have also been extended to incorporate demographics. the model has been revised to incorporate demographics and genetic changes in the populations to simulate the spread of malaria in mali and the plague in the Middle Ages. the authors have used the archimedean copula approach to relate the risk of infection and biological age. rule #2: An infected individual (I) recovers with a probability pIR =. this condition expresses the case of temporal immunity. when these transition probabilities remain constant in time, the markov process is then called time homogenous Markov process. the model assumes random contact between individuals as well as environmental transmission of the virus. non-markovian SIR-like models have been also proposed. a small part of the population can cause a significant change in the characteristics of the transmission network. poor understanding of infectious disease dynamics as these emerge due to heterogeneous contact interactions may result to serious negative consequences. over the last years, there has been an intense effort in studying the interplay between the emergent dynamics of infectious diseases and the underlying topology of transmission network. 61 encounters with 3528 different individuals over 14 non-consecutive days. following 744 students they mapped the transmission network following their friends and contacts. they detected the critical nodes and links that were responsible for rapid spread. epidemiologists, researchers, and policy makers are turning to these detailed models for reasons of ethics, cost, timeliness, and appropriateness. in epidemic systems, testing experimental conditions would put the safety of people at risk, creating an ethical problem. in other cases, real-time evaluation of an existing system may be prohibitively long. agent-based simulations involved 85 million agents residing in Thailand and a 100 km-wide zone of neighboring countries. they evaluated containment strategies with respect to the potential of preventing a pandemic and the distribution of drugs necessary to eradicate the spread. the infected part of the population is divided in compartments in accordance to the state of their health, such as susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R). other states of the population linked with control policies such as vaccinated (V) and quarantined (Q) are also used. in the Kermack and McKendrick model, the disease becomes epidemic, i.e., if and only if. at the number of infected cases reach a maximum and after this it decreases to zero. the threshold is called the basic reproduction number (R0) and indicates whether the disease will become epidemic (if R0 > 1) or it will die out (if R0 1). the model has been extended to incorporate the state of contagious children as well as the state of susceptible Anopheles and the state of contagious Anopheles. the authors used the model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of hepatitis A in the south regions of Italy. the model has been used to simulated the spread of malaria in bancoumana, Mali. the main representative in the category is the discrete Markov chains (DMC) both time and states are defined on a discrete set of values. deterministic mean field approximations may impose bias when assumptions about infinite size population, homogeneous individuals, homogenous or random regular networks do not hold. this situation worsens as heterogeneity becomes stronger (e.g. interactions on more complex networks with finite size populations) kinetics to account for non-constant population with age classes due to birth and death processes and spatial demographics have been also proposed. kinetics to account for non-constant population with age classes due to birth and death processes and spatial demographics have been also proposed. the influence of the clustering coefficient and average path length on epidemic outbreaks evolving on scale free networks. it was shown that there exists a critical value of the rewiring probability that marks the onset of a phase transition from stationary endemic situations. keeling et al. (2010) constructed two metapopulation networks based on information available from 2001 on the commuter movements between 10 000 wards in Great Britain. from the cattle trading system they also constructed the movement network between 150 000 farms. authors raised the question if simple network models can eventually catch the influence of movements in an epidemic. system, multi-agent simulations are considered to incorporate the appropriate level of complexity. for example the Models of Infectious Disease Agent Study (MIDAS), a network launched on may 1, 2004 and funded by the US National Institutes of Health. the authors made use of the GLEaM agent-based computational platform. real-world data from 29 countries around the globe as well as air travel flowing from 3362 airports indexed by IATA were integrated into a spatial metapopulation epidemic model. a linear model was used to relate google search queries related to dengue in Bolivia, Brazil, India, Indonesia, and Singapore using publicly available dengue cases between 2003 and 2010. the authors fitted two models, one for relating web queries volume with the total number of laboratory verified influenza and the number of persons exhibiting influenza-like symptoms treated by physicians in Sweden. simple brute-force temporal simulations are used to study the behavior of detailed agent-based simulators in the presence of such inaccuracies. however, such simple simulations are inefficient for the systematic analysis of the emergent epidemic in the parameter space. new rigorous computational methodologies have the potential to expedite novel computational modeling and analysis."}
