{"summary": "the individual Based Models (IBM) and the Metapopualtion Models are mainly used in recent literature. the first ones are obtained by coupling a transmission model with a highly detailed socio-demographic model. the epidemiological state of any individual is updated at each time step, typically assuming a homogeneous mixing within each context. the distribution in age-classes is generally acknowledged to be a crucial feature for the spreading of an infectious disease [14], [15]. in our model, we consider a population that is age distributed in 4 age classes (0\u20134, 5\u201314, 15\u201364, over 65 years old) the use of lattice models is not a novelty in the literature on epidemic models. in Ref. [29], a SIRS model is formulated on a regular lattice. each site is occupied by an individual, and all the individuals have the same number of contacts, with fixed identity. the focus on time-use data is instead at the base of Ref. [34], where authors make use of time-use surveys data to measure contact patterns and explain observed seroprevalence profiles. in our model, we make the assumption that the spreading of an infectious disease is mainly regulated by the average age-dependent contact patterns of individuals. the effect of this potential is to favor energetically those configurations, in which nearest neighbor sites are occupied by individuals belonging to the same age-class. the model is an attractive lattice-gas on a D-dimensional lattice. it represents the dynamic contact network of individuals. the model is checked on the italian epidemiological data for the influenza A(H1N1) during the 2009/2010 season. the population is randomly distributed on a D-dimensional lattice according to the age group densities of a specific country. the lattice represents the contact network of individuals: contacts and transmission of the infection occur only between nearest neighbors. the dimension D fixes the maximum number of simultaneous contacts that an individual can have. in details, we define the nearest neighbor effective number,, of the individual located at the site 1, and a nearest neighbor destination site, 2, on the lattice. if the site 2 is occupied, another individual is randomly chosen. the probability that the randomly chosen site 2 is empty depends on the local occupation density. in each age-class, the distribution probability is simply given by the binomial distribution. for each dimension D, at low, this function is peaked on, namely the most probable configurations are those with zero nearest neighbors of the same age-class. the mobility constraint is quite inefficient. the system, described in Eq. (4), can be viewed as a mixture of 4 species of particles. in the case of a single type of particles, it reduces to a lattice-gas model. in the Ising model, a second order continuous phase transition separates a high-temperature disordered paramagnetic phase from a low-temperature ferromagnetic ordered one. the potts model presents a complex phase diagram with a first or a second order transition depending on the q and D values. the problem of equilibration using standard algorithm Metropolis with sequential updates of single spin is well known in literature. to describe these possibilities, we associate to each person an internal degree of freedom for the healthy/infective status. susceptible individuals tend to avoid contacts with the infected ones during their symptomatic phase. this tendency is implemented by imposing that the empty sites that are nearest neighbor to symptomatic infected individuals are interdicted. the neighbors of infected individuals can move without any restriction. the dimension D fixes the maximum number of simultaneous contacts that an individual can have. we choose to work with a Neumann neighborhood (i.e. with 2D nearest neighbors) the sites are not all occupied. the probability that an individual moves from the site 1 to the site 2 is empty depends on the local occupation density, increasing as the crowding decreases. if the site 2 is empty, we try to move the individual from the site 1 to the site 2 with the probability. the algorithm adopted, Eq.(1), is a standard Metropolis algorithm for a Hamiltonian system in the canonical ensemble. the system can be viewed as a mixture of 4 species of particles, with an attractive interaction between particles of the same type. a finite critical temperature separates a high-temperature disordered paramagnetic phase from a low-temperature ferromagnetic ordered one. at each instant, domains of up and down spins are present. as time passes, the typical size of the domains increases. transmission model and Adaptive Mobility Rules were developed in order to overcome the critical slowing down. to describe these possibilities, we associate to each person an internal degree of freedom for the healthy/infective status. in our approach, the dynamics is not encoded into the transmission probability but it is considered separately. symptomatic infected individuals can only infect their nearest neighbors at the stop time TS, i.e. the family in our simplified model. each infected individual has her/his own infective period, while the infectivity is taken to be constant during the disease. age-group (age) fa 0\u20134 0.048 5\u201314 0.093 15\u201364 0.659 +65 0.20 Distribution of the italian population in age-classes. we define the contact matrix as the average number of contacts that an individual of age-group j has on average in one day with other people. parameters, after an initial transient, the system reaches a stationary state, in which the total number of contacts in each age-class j is time independent. in the present case, this is not relevant since the parameters, are not observable parameters, the only quantity of interest being instead the contact matrix. in Fig. 2, the values of the diagonal elements are compared to those obtained from the polymod data. the model reproduces correctly the total daily contact numbers in each age-class, but not the mixing patterns among the age-classes. in Fig. 3, we compare the overall observed illness prevalence (per thousand of individuals) of H1N1 influenza cases in Italy from the 40-th week of the year 2009 to the numerical data obtained in our model. the simulated illness cases and their errors are evaluated respectively as mean values and standard deviation. the dissimilarity of different age-class susceptibilities indicated in Table 3 reflects the fact that the H1N1 virus had different incidence on different age classes, causing symptomatic disease mainly in younger population. the smaller incidence on the 0\u20134 years old with respect to the 5\u201314 years old may be due to the minor exposure of this age-class. a direct and more reliable measure of the incidence of infection in the population would have been obtained by comparing the presence of antibodies in serum samples before and after the pandemic. pharyngeal swabs on ILI cases have not been performed systematically, so that a reliable statistic on positive cases is not available. part of the disagreement at the beginning of the outbreak may be due to self-initiated health care measures carried out by many Italian families. generation time distribution, obtained with the simulations on the lattice, is well fitted by an exponential function, with parameters. Deviation from this functional form is observed at large v. the function in Eq. (9) coincides with the probability that the infective period of the infector is greater than the actual time. distribution function of the infective period, evaluated at time v: (10) The function is proportional to the probability that the potential infector is not in the stop (i.e. symptomatic) phase, which is in turn given by the probability that the stop time of the potential infector is greater than the actual time v: (11) This is simply given by the weighted average of the susceptibility on the age groups and does not depend on v. we consider the Italian one, whose age-class distribution is given in Table 2. For each experiment, we simulate independent processes. the linear size of the lattice, L, is fixed in order to have roughly the same number of individuals (for each dimension, D) the linear size of the lattice, L, is fixed in order to have roughly the same number of individuals (for each dimension, D) the number of MCS corresponding to 1 day reduces, with increasing the dimension of the lattice. this is consistent with the fact that higher dimensional topologies imply a potentially higher number of simultaneous nearest neighbors. the individual can reach the appropriate number of new contacts expected in one day, with few movements. in Fig. 1, the polymod data and the simulated values of the total average number of contacts are compared for the 4 age-classes. we also evaluate the matrix, which gives the fraction of the contacts of the age-class j with individuals belonging to the age-class. the model is tested for the Italian epidemiological data of the H1N1 pandemic during the season. we assume both the infective period, and the stop time, to follow exponential distributions. the average stop time is set equal to day, which corresponds to the typical duration of the asymptomatic phase for the influenza. in Fig. 4 we compare the simulated illness cases by age group, on the lattice, with the corresponding data on the H1N1 influenza cases in Italy. the dissimilarity among different age-class susceptibilities indicated in Table 3 reflects the fact that the H1N1 virus had different incidence on different age classes, causing symptomatic disease mainly in younger population. age groups 0\u20134, 15\u201364 and +65 the model reproduces quite accurately the entire epidemic evolution. but it fails to reproduce the very beginning of the outbreak, as well as the descendant phase of the epidemic, for the 5\u201314 years old age group. a worse agreement is observed for the other age-classes (particularly evident for the age-class 5\u201314), which may reflect in the mismatch observed here. generation time, v, is the time interval between the infection of an individual and that of her/his infector. the generation time distribution, obtained with the simulations on the lattice, is well fitted by an exponential function. the function in Eq. (9) coincides with the probability that the infective period of the infector is greater than the actual time, v. the function is proportional to the probability that the potential infector is not in the stop (i.e. symptomatic) phase, which is in turn given by the probability that the stop time of the infector is greater than the actual time v: (11) the model correctly reproduces the age specific epidemic curves of the H1N1 pandemic in Italy for each age-class, except young people (5\u201314 years old) the agreement between the numerical and epidemiological data is only found at the peak of the epidemic (from 44th week to 47th week) the model correctly reproduces the age specific epidemic curves of the H1N1 pandemic in Italy for each age-class. limit of our study is related to the double role of the parameter. it works as a regulator of the assortativity and regulates the overall number of contacts. the 5\u201314 age-class has the peculiarity to be at the same time, the most assortative and the most dynamic age-class. short episodes of contacts are on the same footing as long standing contacts. this simplification is quite reasonable for viral diseases, as influenza. in principle, one should consider the reduction of the viral load during the manifestation. we believe such a simple model could open a valuable alternative perspective with respect to the mostly used \u201crealistic\u201d epidemiological models."}
