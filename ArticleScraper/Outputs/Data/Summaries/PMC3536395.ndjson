{"summary": "major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I and class II molecules bind peptide Ags and present them to CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. the role of MHC-restricted T cells in various aspects of acquired immunity has been noted. a rhesus macaque CD8+ T cell line, 2N5.1, specifically recognized an N-myristoylated 5-mer peptide of the SIV Nef protein. the number of N-myristoylated Nef peptide-specific T cells was increased significantly in the circulation of infected monkeys. the plasma viral load in infected monkeys was found to correlate reciprocally with the number of lipopeptide-specific T cells (8). technique using Wang resin precoupled with a relevant C-terminal amino acid. acylated peptides were released in 95% trifluoroacetic acid. purified samples were subjected to liquid chromatography. antigenic stimulation was repeated every 2 weeks in the presence of irradiated autologous PBMCs. interleukin 2 (IL-2) was added at 0.3 nM after the second stimulation. the concentration was gradually increased to 3 nM by the fourth stimulation. PBMCs (3 105/well) were incubated with saturating amounts (5 g/ml) of monoclonal antibodies (Abs) to CD1a (10H3), CD1b (b3.1), CD1c (M241), MHC class I (W6/32), and MHC class II (L243) or negative-control Ab (P3) for 20 min before the addition of responder T cells (5 104/well) and the C14nef5 Ag more than 10 clones were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit. the amplified TCR genes were cloned into pBlueScript II (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) lipopeptides were synthesized as described previously (8). peptides were synthesized by a manual 9-fluorenylmethoxy carbonyl (Fmoc) solid-phase peptide synthesis technique using Wang resin precoupled with a relevant C-terminal amino acid. the C14-Gly-Gly-Ala-Ile-Ser (C14nef5)-specific T cell line 2N5.1 was described previously (8). another C14nef5-specific T cell line, SN45, was obtained independently. the amount of either gamma interferon (IFN-) or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) released into the medium was measured using Mabtech ELISA kits (Nacka Strand, Sweden) PBMCs (3 105/well) were incubated with saturating amounts (5 g/ml) of monoclonal antibodies (Abs) to CD1a (10H3), CD1b (b3.1 primeScript reverse transcriptase (TaKaRa Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan), RNase H (New England BioLabs, Inc.), and E. coli DNA ligase (New England BioLabs, Inc.) the blunt-ended DNA was then circularized with T4 DNA ligase (New England BioLabs, Inc.) rhesus monkey T cell line, 2N5.1, specifically recognized the 5-mer lipopeptide (C14nef5) derived from the SIV Nef protein (8). SN45 T cells were CD4 and CD8+, and produced IFN- in response to C14nef5, but no response was observed when myristic acid and the 5-mer peptide were added as a free form. rhesus macaque cell transfectants expressing rhesus macaque group 1 CD1 molecules (CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c) and those expressing MM521-derived MHC class I molecules (Mamu-A1*02, Mamu-A1*110, and Mamu-B*56) failed to present C14nef5 to the T cell lines. the molecular identity of the Ag-presenting molecules for the C14nef5 lipopeptide has not yet been determined. rhesus macaques are capable of presenting N-myristoylated peptides to T cells. allogeneic PBMCs derived from all 9 donor rhesus macaques could present the C14nef5 lipopeptide Ag to 2N5.1 (D) and SN45 (E) the transfection efficiency was approximately 50%, as determined by flow cytometric analysis of CD1-transfected cells labeled with relevant anti-CD1 Abs. MM450-derived 2N5.1 T cells (A) and MM521-derived SN45 T cells (B) were stimulated with C14nef5 (+) or unstimulated in the presence of either autologous or allogeneic PBMCs. the amount of IFN- released into the medium was measured as for Fig. 2B. 2N5.1 and SN45 T cells were stimulated with either the N-myristoylated Nef 3-mer (C14nef3), 4-mer (C14nef4), 5-mer (C14nef5), or 6-mer (C14nef6) peptide. the IFN- response of the T cells was measured. 2N5.1 (top) and SN45 (bottom) showed the highest reactivity to the authentic Ag with a saturated C14 fatty acid. 2N5.1 showed moderate reactivity to C10nef5 (Fig. 5A), suggesting that the C-terminal serine residue of C14nef5 was dispensable for the activation of the T cells. cubation with excess amounts of the mutants with alanine substitutions (underlined) resulted in dose-dependent inhibition of the 2N5.1 cell response to C14nef5. excess amounts of the 5-mer peptide with a short acyl chain (C6-GGAIS) failed to block the response of 2N5.1 and SN45 T cells to C14nef5. rhesus macaque PBMCs were stimulated with 2N5.1 (8). the SN45 T cells were CD4 and CD8+ and produced IFN- in response to C14nef5. no response was observed when myristic acid and the 5-mer peptide were added as a free form. rhesus macaque cell transfectants expressing rhesus macaque group 1 CD1 molecules failed to present C14nef5 to the T cell lines. the molecular identity of the Ag-presenting molecules for the C14nef5 lipopeptide has not yet been determined. autologous PBMCs (3 105/well) were preincubated with a saturating amount (5 g/ml) of the indicated Abs and cultured with 2N5.1 (A and B) and SN45 (C) T cells (5 104/well) in the presence (+) or absence of C14nef5 (5 g/ml) allogeneic PBMCs derived from all 9 donor rhesus macaques could present the C14nef5 lipopeptide Ag to 2N5.1 (Fig. 4A) only a single donor (MM460), and not the other 2 donors (MM450 and MM499), was capable of presenting C14nef5 to SN45 (Fig. 4A) 2N5.1 and SN45-specific T cells were stimulated with either the N-myristoylated Nef 3-mer (C14nef3), 4-mer (C14nef4), 5-mer (C14nef5), or 6-mer (C14nef6) peptides of the Nef protein. alanine substitution for either the second glycine residue (C14-GAAIS) or the isoleucine residue (C14-GGAAS T cells were stimulated with a Nef 5-mer peptide that was either unconjugated (C0) or conjugated with a saturated C6, C10, C14, C18, or C22 fatty acid. both 2N5.1 (top) and SN45 (bottom) showed the highest reactivity to the authentic Ag with a saturated C14 fatty acid. we favored the hypothesis that the serine residue of C14nef5 functions as an anchoring residue. if this was the case, even an excess amount of C14nef4 could not replace C14nef5 at the Ag-binding site. if this was the case, even an excess amount of C14nef4 could not replace C14nef5 at the Ag-binding site. 2N5.1 responder cells and the C14nef5 Ag were preincubated with excess amounts of the indicated blockers. after 24 h, the culture supernatants were collected, and the amount of IFN- released into the medium was measured. the analysis of the two CD8+ T cell lines, 2N5.1 and SN45, that recognized the same lipopeptide Ag, C14nef5, revealed their shared and unshared properties. LP1 has two separate Ag-binding sites, one for the acyl chain and the other for the anchoring serine residue (triangle) of SN45 (LP2) the second (glycine) and fourth (isoleucine) residues are positioned outward for preferential interaction with the 2N5.1 TCR. LP2 also has an acyl-chain-binding pocket, but the serine residue critical for binding to LP1 is dispensable. mutants with alanine substitutions (underlined) were not recognized by 2N5.1 but were able to inhibit its recognition of C14nef5. this indicates that the mutants indeed bound to LP1. the putative Ag-presenting molecule, LP2, mediates Ag presentation to SN45, appears much less stringent in terms of Ag binding. the short stretch of the N-terminal amino acid residues of the Nef protein contains N-myristoylation signal is hard to mutate without affecting the function of the protein. this also points to the possibility that the discrimination of foreign lipopeptides from self by the immune system may not be safely and strictly enforced."}
