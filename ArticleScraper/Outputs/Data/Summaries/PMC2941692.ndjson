{"summary": "new technologies are enabling the measurement of many types of genomic and epigenomic information at scales ranging from the atomic to nuclear. many new data is increasingly structural in nature, and is often difficult to coordinate with other data sets. a significant portion of genomic data currently being generated extends beyond traditional primary sequence information. to address these issues, we have created an interactive 3D viewer, Genome3D, to enable integration and visualization of genomic and epigenomic data. the viewer is designed to display data from multiple scales and uses a hierarchical model of the relative positions of all nucleotide atoms in the cell nucleus. a model of the physical genome requires a 3D position (x, y, z) for each bp atom of the genome. the large amount of such data is reduced by exploiting the data's hierarchical organization. this technique reduces the storage size for a human genome to 1.5 gigabytes. geneme3D has multiple windows to visualize the physical genome model from simultaneous different viewpoints and scales. the user can navigate to an arbitrary region of interest by selecting a low resolution region and then loading higher resolution data which appears in another viewing window. the UCSC Genome Database Browser has a variety of epigenetic information that can be exported directly from its web-site. this data can be loaded into Genome3D and displayed on the currently loaded genome model. we suggest possible methods of inferring unique structural relationships at various resolutions. rs6140378, rs2064267 and rs2064267 are numbered 1-4 respectively. the histone position was obtained from [18], the SNPs were taken from a study examining variants associated with HDL cholesterol [19]. such images may reveal structural relationships between non-coding region SNPs and histone phasing. physical genome model can show interplay between histone modifications and other genomic data. the physical genome model also provides a platform to visualize high-throughput gene expression data and its interplay with global binding information. Genome3D allows the user to specify the degree of detail to view, and the corresponding data is loaded dynamically. the interactivity of Genome3D facilitates exploring the model to find areas of interest. the user can navigate to an arbitrary region of interest by selecting a low resolution region and then loading corresponding higher resolution data. the viewing software is completely separated from the multi-scale model that is being viewed. we have chosen a simple open format for each resolution of the model. the impact of nucleosome position on gene regulation is well-known [15]. the rotation and phasing information of DNA sequence may also play a significant role in gene regulation [17], particularly within non-coding regions. s are modeled using the crystal structure of the NCP. bright yellow spheres indicate H3K4me3 and H3K9me3, and orange spheres are H3K27me3, H3K36me3 and H3K79me3. methylations have important gene regulation implications, and methylations have been shown to serve as binding platforms for transcription machinery. a physical model allows expression levels of genes in response to P53 level to be mapped to genome positions together with global P53 binding information. the figure integrates p53 knock-out expression data [23] and p53 binding site information within chromosome 19. a 3D model of a complete physical genome is dynamic and heavily influenced by local and global constraints. an experiment may measure local chromatin structure around a transcription site. this structure can be expressed as a collection of DNA strands, NCPs, and perhaps lower resolution 30 nm chromatin fibers. our data formats are flexible enough to allow partial integration of this information.
