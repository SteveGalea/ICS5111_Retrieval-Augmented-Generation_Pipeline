{"summary": "the mass media is a critical component of response to a worldwide influenza pandemic. it exerts a powerful influence on the way a pandemic is represented or 'framed' it also exerts a powerful influence on the way a pandemic is represented or 'framed' australian journalists from all sectors of the news production process sought to represent pandemic influenza over the period when H5N1 avian influenza became publicly prominent. this study adds to the relatively small pool of empirical literature on journalistic practices in health and medical contexts. it is the only study to have researched journalists\u2019 attitudes and practices specifically in relation to a threatened pandemic. journalists were senior with a median of 145 years in journalism. most had worked for multiple organisations and in differing roles. avian influenza was potentially apocalyptic; it was perceived as \u2018close\u2019 to australia. the degree of public trust and respect vested in the sources for the story gave it both importance and credibility. concerns expressed by authorities such as the world health organisation (WHO), government health officers and ministers, and independent, scientific experts \u2013 those who traditionally enjoy the highest levels of public trust. media coverage had waned, but spread of avian influenza and bird to human infections continued to occur. journalists were bald in stating that events would have to 'up the ante' for the story to regain news coverage. a renewal of media attention would only be generated by one of two events \u2013 humantohuman transmission or entry of the virus into Australia. tv producer spoke of covering biomedical solutions as a response to his own sense of obligation to reassure the public, after having raised a degree of fear in reporting the pandemic threat. a lack of familiarity with scientific terms could impact on the quality of reporting. specialist medical reporters felt themselves to be highly informed and sophisticated in their coverage. one reporter commented on how \u2018invaluable\u2019 it was when reporters were invited to spend a day at a seminar, where they learned facts such as the number and characteristics of influenza strains. journalists perceived speedy delivery of factual information as a premier tool in preventing public panic. some expressed a less qualified perception of their role as public critics and investigators. they resisted the role of publicising the government agenda and were wary of being exploited by either government or commercial interests. risk communication experts, 23, 24 journalists reiterated the importance of openly acknowledging what is known, including uncertainty. they wished particularly to underscore the strategic importance of openly acknowledging what is known, including uncertainty. the flu story increased in prominence because journalists viewed avian influenza as coming closer to Australia. geographical proximity gave the story relevance as avian influenza spread through southeast Asian neighbours. avian influenza was a 'false alarm' that no longer justified news time. they expressed a degree of cynicism that the promised pandemic had failed to eventuate and was hence no longer worthy of attention. journalists were bald in stating that events would have to \u2018up the ante\u2019 for the story to regain news coverage. a strong focus left less room for coverage of community reactions, community preparedness, government preparedness planning, or public health actions centring on behaviours. few would speak of public health measures like social distancing, quarantine, border control or personal protective equipment \u2013 all prominent in the government\u2019s pandemic plan. reporters with little prior knowledge of the issues are assigned to the story. this increases the risk of inaccurate coverage. a lack of familiarity with scientific terms could impact on the quality of reporting. journalists were placed in a dilemma when contemplating their response to a significant outbreak of influenza. they articulated a clear commitment to their roles as public informants, independent and neutral \u2013 yet also wished to support public interests and efforts of public health officials. some acknowledged concerns about creating public panic or harmful public reactions would have an influence on the content, angle and style of their reporting. journalists were adamant they would continue to work in a pandemic despite the dangers to themselves. none were aware of any pandemic planning undertaken by their media organisation. journalists offered advice for how health experts could support the media in providing quality news coverage in the event of a pandemic. study suggests that as time passes, journalists resume their role as critics of government and prioritise news values such a dissent and novelty above other public goods. 'postmortem' reflections from government and community leaders on the handling of an outbreak have high news value. we agree that actively providing good \u2018vision\u2019 and \u2018talent\u2019 to media organisations may mitigate the effects of competition in the media. journalists sought to diversify their sources as part of providing new and interesting angles, but found that at exactly this time many of those best qualified to comment were tied up at the coalface. a relatively small number of editors and producers not allowing the full exploration of how a particular role or medium influenced news production. health experts can do much to help ensure that local mass and mainstream media coverage of outbreaks, epidemics or even pandemics is accurate and publicly useful.
