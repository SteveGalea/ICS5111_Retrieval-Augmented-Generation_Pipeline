{"summary": "calcitonin Thioflavin-T (ThT) fluorescence based assay was used to monitor amyloid formation of hCT. 25 M hCT gave a strong ThT emission, reaching the plateau stage after 40 h incubation with a lag time of 22.84 2.03 h. the maximum ThT fluorescence intensity was substantially decreased to 42% of that of the control, accompanied with a prolonged lag time of 47.19 3.62 h (P 0.05). compared to Mag, Hon was less potent on inhibiting hCT aggregation. addition of 3-fold and 5-fold amount of Hon showed stronger inhibitory effects. mag and honokiol inhibited both oligomerization and fibrillation of hCT. the effects of mag and honokiol on hCT oligomerization and fibrillation were further determined by immuno-dot blot. the addition of an equimolar amount of EGCG decreased the average diameter to 1300 nm after 72 h. however, when a 5-fold molar excess of Mag and Hon was added, the average diameters of hCT aggregates were significantly decreased to 680 and 1630 nm after 72 h. ability of 82% (P 0.05) at higher concentrations (3-fold and 5-fold), Hon increased cell viabilities to 89% and 93%, respectively (P 0.05). the effect of magnolol and honokiol on cytotoxicity and membrane disruption caused by hCT aggregates was determined by ThT flu. hCT was pre-incubated for 48 h to form aggregates, different amounts of compounds were then added. adding equimolar amounts of Mag and Hon showed no apparent disaggregation effect, while the presence of 3-fold amount of either compound prevented further aggregation of hCT. TEM images of disaggregation effects of different compounds. hCT incubated for 96 h; (D) hCT aggregates incubated with equimolar of EGCG for 48 h; (E\u2013F) hCT aggregates incubated with 5-fold amounts of magnolol (E) and honokiol (F) for 48 h. ITC measurements indicated Mag bound to hCT at a 1:1 stoichiometry. Hon interacted with hCT at a 3:1 stoichiometry. 25 M hCT gave a strong ThT emission, reaching the plateau stage after 40 h incubation. amount of Mag extended the lag time to 33.34 1.67 h (P 0.05) without significantly reducing the maximum ThT fluorescence intensity. however, in the presence of 3-fold molar excess of Mag, the maximum ThT fluorescence intensity was substantially decreased to 42% of that of the control. mag and Hon inhibited both oligomerization and fibrillation of hCT. fewer aggregates were observed in the presence of 5-fold molar amount of Mag or Hon. oligomers were observed after 24 h of incubation. the particle size distribution of amyloid aggregates was further determined by dynamic light scattering (DLS) for hCT, the observed average diameter of aggregates was 580 nm after 24 h of incubation, and was increased to over 5000 nm after 72 h. the presence of equimolar amounts of EGCG decreased the average diameter to 1300 nm after 72 h. the presence of an equimolar amount of Hon was less effective than Mag on reducing cytotoxicity with a cell viability of 82%. at higher concentrations (3-fold and 5-fold), Hon increased cell viabilities to 89% and 93%, respectively. olol and honokiol can disaggregate preformed hCT aggregates. hCT was pre-incubated for 48 h to form aggregates. adding equimolar amounts of Mag and Hon showed no apparent disaggregation effect. mag bound to hCT with a Kb of (3.81 1.28) 105 M1, while H and s were 831.3 107.7 cal/mol and 22.7 cal/mol/deg respectively. hCT aggregates incubated for 96 h; hCT aggregates incubated with equimolar of EGCG for 48 h. ITC measurements also indicated Mag bound to hCT at a 1:1 stoichiometry, while Hon interacted with hCT at a 3:1 stoichiometry. a number of compounds have thus been screened or designed as amyloid inhibitors17,61. ITC assay showed EGCG bound to hCT through intermolecular - stacking, therefore inhibiting the aggregation of hCT55. compared with Hon, Mag showed a similar inhibitory effect at a low equimolar concentration (1:1), but stronger inhibitory effects at high concentrations (3:1 and 5:1) the molecular mechanism of inhibitory effects of Mag and Hon on hCT amyloid formation remains to be clarified. it will be of great interest to detect monomer and polymers formed during aggregation with specific monoclonal antibody. 2-Oleoyl-1-palmitoyl-snglycero-3-phospho-rac-(1-glycerol) sodium salt (POPG) and carboxyfluorescein were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, USA) all other chemical reagents were of the highest grade available. the blots were blocked in 10 % nonfat milk TBST for 30 min at room temperature, then incubated with A11 and OC antibodies for 4 h at 4 \u00b0C. the blots were further incubated with ECL reagent (Millipore, Billerica, USA) for 2 min, and developed. h were added into the POPG vesicles at a final peptide concentration of 1 M. the vesicles were then treated with 0.2% Triton X-100. all experiments were repeated for at least three times. hCT and compounds were dissolved in 50 mM PBS (pH 7.4, containing 100 mM NaCl) solutions were degassed for 5 min by using ThermoVac (GE Healthcare, USA) hCT was used as a titrant in the sample cell at a concentration of 10 M. Mag (0.2 mM) and Hon (0.4 mM) were loaded into the syringe. hCT was dissolved in 50 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4) containing 100 mM NaCl to a final concentration of 25 M. samples were incubated at 37 \u00b0C and sonicated with a SB25-12DTD sonicator. the blots were incubated with secondary anti-rabbit IgG antibody. the blots were further incubated with ECL reagent (Millipore, Billerica, USA) for 2 min. the samples were then stained with 1% uranyl formate. cells were cultured in DMEM high glucose medium containing 10% FBS, 1% penicillin-streptomycin solution and 1% sodium pyruvate. all experiments were repeated for at least three times. the first injection volume was 3 L with 6-s duration, while the rest was 10 L with injection duration of 20 s. the rest injection volume was 10 L with injection duration of 20 s."}
