{"summary": "hPIV-2 is a member of the genus Rubulavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. it possesses a single-stranded non-segmented and negative stranded RNA genome. hPIV-2 has 7 structural proteins, nucleoprotein (NP), V, phosphoprotein (P), matrix (M), fusion (F), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and large (L plant lectins have been shown to inhibit the infection of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [13,14,15] and cytomegalovirus [13,14] plant lectins were reported to inhibit the infection by the prevention of virus adsorption to the cells [16] but also prevent fusion of HIV with their target cells [13,14]. mAbs against NP, F and HN proteins of hPIV-2 were analyzed. binding of lectins to the cells was analyzed using rhodamine phalloidin and anti-tubulin mAb. hemadsorption (Had) was not observed in the lectin-treated hPIV-2-infected cells. the three lectins and three rhodamine labeled-lectins did not disturb normal cell morphology at the concentration used in the experiments. the number of base pairs between forward and reverse primers of NP, F and HN genes was about 800. lectins largely inhibited NP gene synthesis, but did not inhibit F and HN gene syntheses. lectins largely inhibited NP gene synthesis, but did not inhibit F and HN gene syntheses. NP protein was observed in many strong fluorescent dots mainly in the cytoplasm. NP, F and HN proteins were not observed in the cells. LCA partly inhibited expression of the NP, F and HN proteins. the lectins were added to the cell culture, and the cells were infected with rghPIV-2M (1 105 TCID50: multiplicity of infection 0.2) they were then cultured for four days. they were then fixed and observed under a fluorescence microscope. the results indicate that the lectins considerably prevented virus entry. titers of virus released from cells cultured with and without lectins were determined. without the lectins, the virus titer was 2 106 TCID50/mL. with the lectins it reduced to about 1x102 TCID50/mL. there were no differences in effects of the three lectins on the virus yield. the effects of the three lectins on Cytoskeleton. the cytoskeleton was observed under an immunofluorescence microscope at 20 h of cultivation. con A disrupted slightly both actin microfilaments and microtubules. but PNA exhibited no effect on the cytoskeleton. the three lectins bind to each cell receptor, but not to the sialic acids. the cytoskeletons were important for virus entry and replication in cells. actin is necessary for murine leukemia virus entry into cells [21] and for transcription/replication of measles virus [22]. microfilaments and microtubules of cells cultured with ConA, C and G are those of the cells cultured with LCA, and D and H those of the cells with PNA, (bar: 50 m). the cell fusion induced by hPIV-2 at four days post infection, and the effect of the three lectins on the cell fusion. virus-synthesized RNA was prepared from the lectin-treated infected cells at four days post infection. the number of base pairs between forward and reverse primers of NP, F and HN genes was about 800. conA almost completely inhibited the synthesis of the NP gene. the lectins largely inhibited NP gene synthesis, but did not inhibit F and HN gene syntheses. the number of base pairs between forward and reverse primers is about 800. lectins were added to the cells and they were infected with hPIV-2. lectins partly inhibited both hPIV-2 RNA and largely inhibited protein syntheses. lectins were added to the cell culture, and the cells were infected with rghPIV-2M (1 105 TCID50: multiplicity of infection 0.2) rghPIV-2M infected the cells, replicated in the cells and caused cell-to-cell infection. lectins significantly prevented virus entry, the small amount of virus entered into cells, the virus could replicate only in a single cell, and could not infect neighboring cells. binding of the three lectins to the cells was analyzed using rhodamine-labeled lectins. labeled lectins were added to the cells, which were then infected with hPIV-2. some aggregates were observed at 30 min (Figure 5D, E and F for Con A, LCA and PNA, respectively) plant lectins are known to bind to the cell surface sugar moieties. recombinant chimeric lectins inhibited influenza A virus replication. plant lectins inhibited virus replication by preventing virus adsorption to the cells. Con A and LCA induced a slight morphology change in both actin microfilaments and microtubules. the cells were cultured with the lectin for 20 h, and actin microfilaments were stained with rhodamine phalloidin (A-D) and the anti-tubulin mAb (E-H) rghPIV-2 (Toshiba strain) was constructed according to the method described previously. it was shown that rghPIV-2M did not produce infectious virus particles into the culture medium without addition of M protein gene in trans. the recombinant virus induced multinucleated giant cells with strong fluorescence at four days post infection. cDNA was synthesized with 2 g of RNA using superscript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), with forward primers for NP, F and HN genes. PCR was carried out with cDNA using forward and reverse primers for NP, F and HN genes [23] and Ex Taq (Takara, Shiga, Japan) clone B-5-1-2, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA. lectins had a partial inhibitory effect on virus RNA synthesis and inhibited protein syntheses."}
