{"summary": "the term \u201cmicrobiome\u201d was coined by Whipps, Lewis, and Cooke in 1988. it was defined as \u201cthe ecological community of commensal, symbiotic, and pathogenic microorganisms that literally share our body space\u201d. the viral component of the microbiome, termed the \u201cvirome\u201d [3] is a poorly understood facet of the microbiome. new advances in next generation sequencing technologies are making virome characterization more technologically and financially possible. this review will build a framework of the human virome from an ecological perspective. it will identify currently underappreciated and possibly undiscovered roles of the virome. a lack of structure has arguably hindered the true understanding of non-pathogenic consequences of human-virome interactions. a lack of structure has arguably hindered the true understanding of non-pathogenic consequences of human-virome interactions. a lack of structure in this endeavor has arguably hindered the true understanding of non-pathogenic consequences of human-virome interactions. this arrangement provides functional information about the nature and plasticity of virus-host interaction in a way absent in the more classical types of organization mentioned above. the application of this scaffold will not only deepen the understanding of known virus-host interactions in the ecological context of the virome, but also identify logical next steps. human Pathogenic Poxviridae Orthopoxvirus Vaccinia virus Human Pathogenic Reoviridae Rotavirus Rotavirus A Human Pathogenic Rhabdoviridae Lyssavirus Rabies virus Human Pathogenic Rhabdoviridae Vesiculovirus Vesicular stomatitis virus Human Pathogenic / Persistent Paramyxoviridae Morbilivirus Measles virus Human Pathogenic / Persistent Para herpesviridae Cytomegalovirus Human cytomegalovirus Human Atypically Pathogenic / Commensal Parvoviridae Erythrovirus Human parvovirus B19 Trichomonas vaginalis virus 1 Trichomonas Atypically Pathogenic / Mutualistic (1\u00b0) Retroviridae Betaretrovirus Human endogenous retrovirus K Human Commensal Chrysoviridae Alphatorquevirus Torque ten there are 129 known human viral pathogens [29] and at least 219 viruses that can infect humans [30], with more being discovered every year [31,32] parasitic viruses are a morose facet of human history, but they have contributed to man\u2019s evolution as a species. pathogenic viruses cause an acute disease in which the host either lives or dies. the key characteristic of pathogenic viruses is that they cause an acute disease in which the host either lives or dies. in these interactions, hosts typically mount strong immune responses and literally fight for their lives. this is not to say that all pathogenic infections are deadly or resolved immediately. a person shedding virus will be out and about among currently uninfected individuals. this is exemplified by secondary bacterial pneumonia. by the time a person has become ill, they have likely spread the virus by direct contact with an uninfected individual, contaminated fomites, or aerosolized respiratory droplets. persistent viruses may go through stages of dormancy and reactivation, or slow replication for a long period of time. this ability to progress to persistence for months, years, or the entire life of the host clearly delineates these viruses from the pathogenic viruses. non-conventional methods of inoculation have arisen concomitant with certain human tendencies and interactions. for viruses like hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) that circulate in their host, these disruptions of natural barriers created a heyday for transmission. I classify viruses that impact host physiology without directly eliciting a disease state as atypically pathogenic viruses. some viruses infect humans without ever causing disease while others inhabit and change the composition of the human microbiome without ever infecting human cells. this type of interaction has not been defined as a facet of the virome. the estimated 1015 phages present in the human gut are not likely to be completely benign. the presence of this amount of genomic and proteinaceous material is unlikely to be immunologically inert. phagocytic cells of the immune system can ingest phages [71] atypically pathogenic viruses are linked to autoimmune, allergic, and pathogenic phenotypes. these interactions are reminiscent of the use of viruses as agents for forwarding their host\u2019s survival in parasitoid wasps and plants. the recognition of the leishmania-infecting LRV1 virus by human macrophages can promote inflammation, subvert the immune response, and ultimately promote persistence of the parasite. most humans can expect to be infected with at least one influenza virus per year. in general, virus is shed one to two days after infection, with symptoms usually presenting one day later. this is exemplified by secondary bacterial pneumonia. but by the time a person has become ill, they have likely spread the virus by direct contact with an uninfected individual. measles virus appears to have diverged from rinderpest sometime in the 11th or 12th century B.C. [48] this can explain much of the bias of current knowledge toward pathogenic viruses. some of the most clinically important viruses of the last century were not classically pathogenic, but rather, persist within the host in relative silence. the most conventional method by which persistent viruses are transmitted is contact between mucous membranes. this includes kissing and sexual intercourse, but can also include transmission vertically from mother to child. the prototypical example is herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) which, after an initial acute or subclinical infection, moves into a sensory neuron and enters a period of latency. the disease of AIDS weakens the immune system drastically, allowing opportunistic microbes to cause fatal disease. HCV is the most common cause of chronic liver disease, cirrhosis, and liver cancer in the form of Hepatocellular Carcinoma. the delayed onset and long-term homeostasis of persistent viruses within their hosts makes them a unique class within the human virome. in the autoimmune disease Multiple Sclerosis (MS), human endogenous retrovirus (HERV) syncytin expression is upregulated in lesions and leads to an increase of cellular protein oxidation and destruction of oligodendrocytes. another possible autoimmune contribution of EREs is by their engagement of nucleic acid pattern recognition and downstream immune activation during both their RNA and cDNA synthesis. toll-like Receptors (TLRs) -7 and -9 play key roles in the production of autoantibodies. these autoantibodies could be derived from any number of endogenous sources, including those of phages. it is possible that B-cell Receptor (BCR)-mediated endocytic or plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC) phagocytic internalization of phages could deliver ligands necessary the commensal virus was originally coined to describe an organism that benefitted from being on or in a host but did not have any direct detriment or benefit for the host. a better understanding of the viruses that typically inhabit humans will likely lead to a concomitant rise in the cases identified as atypically pathogenic. the targeted utilization of phages to eliminate unwanted bacterial pathogens (phage therapy) was introduced in the early 1900s and has many potential benefits including low toxicity, treatment of antibiotic resistant infections, and rapid discovery/generation. concerns over unknown health implications and the rise of antibiotics stalled the field, though a renaissance has been building since the 1990s. some commensal viruses can infect human cells and use the human as a vessel for transmission. these viruses establish asymptomatic infections that do not result in a change in host health or behavior. the most well documented examples of asymptomatic infection of humans by commensal viruses are the rhinoviruses. mutualistic viruses have a positive health benefit for both organisms involved. a mutualistic interaction is one that benefits both organisms involved. this is counterintuitive considering that nearly all mutualistic interactions were probably a form of parasitism, then passed through a commensal stage. a small body of literature characterizing virus-human mutualism has given a glimpse into this facet of the virome. in the next sections, I will review two levels of symbiotic relationships and discuss important gaps in knowledge important for the understanding and possible utilization for human health. insertion in or near promotion and regulatory elements can result in changes in transcriptional control. insertion in or near promotion and regulatory elements can result in changes in transcriptional control [124], as can the native regulatory sequences in the EREs themselves. destabilization of the genome or particular genes could have profound negative effects on the host. retroviral-modified chimeric antigen receptor T-cells (CAR T-cells) have shown impressive application for the activation of adaptive immunity against cancers, though there have also been morbid failures in this field. the application of retroviral-modified CAR T-cells could presumably be expanded to infectious disease as well. HIV infection to AIDS pathogenesis can suppress HIV infection by limiting availability of the coreceptor CCR5 on macrophages [142]. infection with HCV can suppress infection with HCV and may actually promote clearance [143]. evidence from mice supports assertion that viruses can confer resistance to non-viral disease as well as infection with murine gammaherpesvirus results in protection from challenge with Listeria [144]. primary symbiotic Viruses are considered primary symbionts. these relationships are often ancient and obligated for both parties. some have been inactivated by recombination, deletions, and random mutations. many still appear to be expressed. Adaptive responses to EREs can also play a role in restricting viruses by neutralizing incoming exogenous virus via antibody development against ERE surface glycoprotein antigens. the acquisition of ERV syncytins has been a critical step in the evolution of placentation in humans [27,132,133]. secondary symbionts are acquired via non-germline vertical transmission. phages can regulate bacterial species in the gut. free phages may also serve a similar role as sentinels maintaining a balanced microbiota. there has recently been a resurgence of interest as the problem of antimicrobial resistance has become dire. the human virome has the potential to lend insight into the basic and applied biology of human health. it has been estimated that healthy humans are infected with > 10 viral infections at any given time. this constant barrage of immunogenic material presumably drives a smoldering activation of both innate and adaptive immunity. definitions are logical, the intermixing of the groups drives home the point that the virome has inherent plasticity. disruption of the yin and yang of virus-host interactions can contribute to this transitory nature and may blur the lines that delineate the main groups."}
