{"summary": "SOCS1 and SOCS3 inhibit signaling from both overlapping and separate subsets of cytokine receptors. they exert their function by associating with phosphorylated tyrosine residues on Janus kinases (JAKs) and/or cytokine receptor subunits. this disrupts the classical JAK/STAT signaling pathway employed by a vast number of cytokine receptors (2, 3) both IFN- and IFN- have the capacity to induce SOCS1 and -3 expression in astrocytes in vitro. however, at the present time, our insight into the regulation of SOCS expression in the inflamed CNS in vivo is limited (4). KO mice have investigated which regulatory mechanisms may be involved in mediating a virus induced upregulation of SOCS in the infected CNS. we found that i.c. infection with lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) results in a significant upregulation of SOCS1/3 mRNA expression peaking at day 7 postinfection (p.i.) ficient and IFN-R-deficient mice on a C57BL/6 background were the progeny of breeder pairs provided by D. Pinschewer and R. Zinkernagel. mice from outside sources were always allowed to acclimatize to the local environment for at least a week before entering into experiments. yF is a cytolytic virus that in humans has a preferential tropism for the liver. but in i.c.-infected mice the attenuated vaccine strain induces a fatal encephalitis, causing death from paralysis on days 8 to 9 postinfection. qPCR components included Brilliant II qPCR Mastermix, Milli-Q water, reverse-transcribed cDNA and forward and reverse target gene primers. target gene expression was normalized to expression of the reference gene PBGD (porphobilinogen) each reaction was run in triplicate plus a no-template control and a no-reverse transcriptase control. PCR is calculated from the slope of a standard curve based on 5-fold dilutions for each primer pair used.

IL-10 deficient mice were obtained from the Jackson laboratories. female mice were used in most experiments, but when both genders were included, no gender effect was observed. yF is a cytolytic virus that in humans has a preferential tropism for the liver. but in i.c.-infected mice the attenuated vaccine strain induces a fatal encephalitis, causing death from paralysis on days 8 to 9 postinfection. this encephalitis is observed also in RAG-deficient mice. qPCR mastermix, milli-Q water, reverse-transcribed cDNA, and forward and reverse target gene primers. target gene expression was normalized to expression of the reference gene PBGD (porphobilinogen) each reaction was run in triplicate plus a no-template control and a no-reverse transcriptase control.

LCMV-induced inflammation of the CNS is associated with upregulation of SOCS1 and -3 gene expression in the brains of infected mice. mRNA expression of both SOCS genes increased quite markedly from day 3 to day 7 p.i., verifying our initial prediction that virus-induced inflammation of the CNS is associated with upregulation of SOCS1 and -3 gene expression. the expression of type I IFN-related genes reached near-maximum levels on day 3 p.i., followed by a gradual increase with peak expression on day 7 p.i. the expression of type II IFN (IFN-) is delayed, and peak expression correlates with the appearance of IFN-. the correlation between IFN- and SOCS gene expression suggests that type II IFN or other factors produced by the infiltrating T cells might be the dominating mediator(s). prior studies have revealed IL-10 production by infiltrating T cells after virus-induced inflammation of the CNS (40, 41), and the possibility existed that IL-10 might be involved in the induction of SOCS gene expression. both SOCS1 and -3 mRNA were expressed by cells in the meningeal membrane (Fig. 4A and B), by ependymocytes lining the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle (Fig. 4C and D) both SOCS1 and -3 mRNA were expressed by cells in the meningeal membrane (Fig. 4A and B), by ependymocytes lining the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle ( CS3 mRNAs were detected in the brain on day 3 after infection with LCMV (A and B), whereas both were upregulated in multiple cells (arrows) on day 7 after infection with LCMV (C and D) mRNAs were both undetectable in comparable sections at 7 days after the injection of PBS. SOCS1 and to some extent SOCS3 expression is dependent on IFN- but not IL-10. we infected IL-10/, IFN-R/, IFN-R/, T cell-deficient (nu/nu/nu) and quantified SOCS1 and -3 mRNA levels on day 7 p.i. CS3 were determined in the CNSs of IL-10/, IFN-R/, IFN-R/, nude, and WT mice infected i.c. with LCMV 7 days earlier. each point represents one animal; the data are pooled from two independent experiments. SOCS1 expression is reduced on day 5 p.i. in IFN-R/ mice. the levels of mRNA expression for SOCS1 and -3 were determined in the CNSs of IFN-R/ and WT mice infected with LCMV 5 days earlier. seven days after virus inoculation, SOCS1 mRNA levels in IFN-R/ recipients were found to be substantially reduced compared to both syngeneic chimeras and intact WT mice. these results strongly suggest that brain resident cells contribute substantially to the expression of SOCS1. these observations fit well with the results obtained in intact IFN-R/ mice. cleaved caspase-3 is a critical executioner of apoptosis. it is detected in several cells throughout the brains of YF-infected mice. cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was also present in the CNSs of YF-infected mice at 7 days p.i. cleavage of PARP is one of the main cleavage targets of caspase-3 involved in DNA repair in response to environmental stress. cleavage of PARP serves as a caspase-3 downstream marker of cells undergoing apoptosis. YF and to some extent LCMV induce cleavage of caspase-3. the mRNA levels of SOCS1 and -3 in the brain were determined by qPCR. mice inoculated with PBS served as baseline controls. the mRNA levels of both SOCS genes increased quite significantly from day 3 to day 7 p.i. both SOCS1 and -3 mRNA were upregulated in multiple cells even far away from the injection site. neither SOCS1 nor -3 were detectable at day 7 after injection of PBS. both were expressed in multiple cells (arrows) throughout the brain on day 7 after infection with YF virus. images show YF-induced SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expression in cells (arrows) in the meningeal membrane (A and B), in the ependyma (C and D), in association with vessels (E and F), in hippocampus proper, the external capsule, and the neocortex (G and H), and in the neocortex (I and J). the images were either single stained (K to N) or merged (O mRNA was highly expressed by cells in the meningeal membrane (Fig. 14C) and by ependymocytes lining the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle (Fig. 14D) however, unlike the situation in the LCMV-infected CNS, CXCL10 mRNA was also highly expressed by vessel-associated cells (Fig. 14E) and by glia-like cells in the entire brain, including the hippocampus (Fig. 14 in situ hybridization for SOCS mRNA and immunohistochemistry GFAP showing CXCL10 mRNA expression by GFAP+ astrocytes. images were either single stained (H and I) or merged (J). YF-induced expression of SOCS1 and -3 is only partially dependent on IFN- produced by infiltrating T cells. the levels of mRNA expression for SOCS1 (A) and SOCS3 (B) were determined in the CNSs of IL-10/, IFN-R/, nude, and WT mice infected with YF 7 days earlier. both SOCS1 and -3 are known to be important negative regulators of proinflammatory cytokine activity. mRNA levels for SOCS1 and SOCS3 (A), IRF7 and USP18 (B) and IFN- and IL-10 (C) in the brain were determined by qPCR. brains from mice inoculated with PBS 3 days earlier served as negative controls. peak expression of type II IFN (IFN-) is delayed. peak expression correlates with maximum T cell influx into the infected brains. mRNA levels increased markedly on day 7 p.i. both SOCS1 and -3 mRNA were expressed by cells in the meningeal membrane (Fig. 4A and B), by ependymocytes lining the lateral ventricles and the third ventricle (Fig. 4C and D), by vessel-associated cells (Fig. 4G and H and Fig. 4I and J) and finally in cells in the deepest layers of neocortex and in hippocampus proper (Fig. 4G and H) combined in situ hybridization for SOCS mRNA and immunostaining for GFAP protein revealed that at least some of the SOCS1 and -3 mRNA-expressing cells were GFAP+ astrocytes. LCMV-induced SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA upregulation detected by in situ hybridization in the brains of WT mice. in situ hybridization for SOCS mRNA and immunohistochemistry for GFAP showing SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA expressing GFAP+ astrocytes. images were either single stained (K to N) or merged (O and P) the levels of mRNA expression for SOCS1 and SOCS3 were determined in the CNSs of IL-10/, IFN-R/, IFN-R/, nude, and WT mice infected i.c. with LCMV 7 days earlier. each point represents one animal; the data are pooled from two independent experiments. the levels of mRNA expression for SOCS1 and -3 were determined in the CNSs of naive IFN-R/, IFN-R/, and WT mice. each point represents one animal. the time course of LCMV-induced upregulation of SOCS expression cannot solely be ascribed to type II IFN, since some SOCS upregulation may be observed even before this cytokine can be detected. we generated syngeneic and allogeneic bone marrow chimeras using WT donor mice and IFN-R/ or WT recipient mice. seven days after virus inoculation, SOCS1 mRNA levels in IFN-R/ recipients were found to be substantially reduced compared to both syngeneic chimeras and WT mice. chimeras were infected i.c. with LCMV virus. mRNA levels for SOCS1 (A) and SOCS3 (B) were determined on day 7 p.i. each point represents one animal. the data are pooled from two independent experiments. cleaved caspase-3 was not detected on day 7 after PBS injection. cleaved poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase was also present in the CNSs of YF-infected mice at 7 days p.i. cleavage of PARP serves as a caspase-3 downstream marker of cells undergoing apoptosis. mRNA levels of SOCS1 and -3 in the brain increased quite significantly from day 3 to day 7 p.i. mRNA levels of both SOCS genes increased quite significantly from day 3 to day 7 p.i. this could suggest that the regulation of SOCS mRNA expression in the YF and LCMV models occurred through similar pathways. in situ detection of SOCS mRNA day 7 p.i. with YF showed that both SOCS1 and -3 mRNA were upregulated in multiple cells even far away from the injection site. neither SOCS1 nor -3 mRNA were detectable at day 7 after injection of PBS. in situ hybridization for SOCS and immunohistochemistry for GFAP showed that at least some of the SOCS mRNA-expressing cells appeared to be GFAP+ astrocytes. both SOCS1 and SOCS3 mRNA were expressed in multiple cells (arrows) throughout the brain on day 7 after infection with YF virus. cc, corpus callosum; Ctx, cortex; E, ependyma; EC, external capsule; Hip, hippocampus; MM, meningeal membrane; v, vessel. CXCL10 mRNA was also upregulated in multiple cells in the entire brain 7 days after infection with YF (Fig. 14A) but undetectable after injection of PBS (Fig. 14B) YF-induced CXCL10 mRNA upregulated by cells (arrows) throughout the brains of WT mice on day 7 after infection with YF (A) but absent in comparable sections on day 7 after the injection of PBS (B) the images were either single stained (H and I) or merged (J). the levels of SOCS1 and SOCS3 expression were determined in the CNSs of IL-10/, IFN-R/, nude, and WT mice infected i.c. with YF 7 days earlier. the levels of mRNA expression for SOCS1 and SOCS3 were determined in the CNSs of IL-10/, IFN-R/, nude, and WT mice. LCMV is a nonlytic virus that induces a massive influx of virus-specific T cells, resulting in severe meningoencephalitis and death 8 to 10 days p.i. yF infection induces widespread apoptosis throughout the brain. yF infection induces widespread apoptosis throughout the brain. RNA levels increase markedly from day 3 to day 7 p.i., correlating with the appearance of T cells and IFN- in infected brains. qPCR results could reflect upregulation of SOCS expression in the infiltrating cells, particularly after i.c. yF infection. we found that SOCS1 and -3 are expressed in astrocytes, which are also a major source of proinflammatory CXCL10 production following i.c. infection with LCMV (26), and in both cases IFN- acts as a positive regulator. this model has some precedence in a study in which the authors showed that overexpression of SOCS1 in pancreatic islet cells in part prevented the development of virus-induced diabetes. infection represents a case of too-little, too-late counter-regulation. the involved genes also affect other critical parameters of the virus-host interaction, such as immune response and/or virus distribution. however, depending on the circumstances even following infection with cytolytic viruses, immune pathology may contribute to the severity of disease."}
