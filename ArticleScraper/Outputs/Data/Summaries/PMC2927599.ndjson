{"summary": "the frequent occurrence of ferret badger-associated human rabies cases in southeast china highlights the lack of laboratory-based surveillance. an active rabies survey was conducted to determine the frequency of rabies infection in dogs and ferret badgers. southeast china counts for most cases, with more than 90% attributed to rabid dog bites. rabies is re-emerging as a major public health threat, and its severity is only second to HIV and tuberculosis among all reported infectious diseases. close and frequent contact of FB by humans could be an important factor in human and dog rabies cases in southeast china. we conducted an expanded retrospective/prospective epidemiological survey on FB-associated human rabies cases. animal experiments related to this study were approved by the committee of animal welfare and ethics of veterinary research institute, Academy of Military Medical Sciences. all animals including ferret badgers, dogs and mice that showed clinical signs of infection were killed humanely. infected FB brains were extracted using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the nucleoprotein (N) and glycoprotein (G) genes were amplified by RT-PCR following the protocol described by Nadin-Davis et al. fifty _l of challenge rabies virus (CVS-11) containing 100 TCID50 was added to each well. 50 l cell suspension containing 2 104 cells was added to each well. wells exhibiting no specific fluorescence were considered antibody positive. FB and dog brain specimens and Fluorescent Antibody Test (FAT) Dead or live FB collected in fields and houses, and dogs that had bitten people were sent to designated laboratories for diagnoses. surveyed mountainous areas were Huzhou, Hangzhou, Jinhua, Quzhou, Lishui in Zhejiang province. the suspension of the sample was injected intracerebrally to 1-day-old suckling mice. the mice were observed for 28 days. the brain smear was made to re-check for the presence of rabies virus antigen using the FAT. the Bootstrap values were calculated from 1,000 repeats using 70% as the cut-off. all the FBs were alive and appeared healthy when the serum was collected. rabies cases potentially associated with FB transmission were inferred retrospectively and prospectively on the basis of exposure records. the patients included FB-hunters who capture and sell FBs, farmers with occasional exposure to sick FBs, and residents who were exposed to sick FBs in their yard or house. hunters lay their traps according to the number of FB tracks. the number of FB tracks is about 38-95 per km2. despite frequent contact with rabies- susceptible animals, no hunters are aware of the potential danger. the average rabies seroconversion rate was 69.6%, ranging from 0 (no neutralizing antibody in all individuals) to 95% in different collections. in the 77 dog serum samples, the detectable VNA was 18.2% (14/77) the overall percentage of VNA positive was relatively lower from dogs than the samples from FBs. group 1 compromises RVs all across south and southeast China, and group 2 is formed by Chinese isolates distributed in Guizhou, Jiangsu, Henan, Jilin provinces. in general, Chinese dog-associated lineages shared nucleotide identity from 87 to 98% (Figure 1). phylogenetic tree of FB isolates using full length N gene (1353 bp) was segregated in an independent lineage. the nucleotide identity of FB isolates with current south and southeast Chinese dog-related lineages ranged from 87 to 89%.
