{"summary": "in young adults, the HEV case fatality rate is 0.5 to 3%. in young adults, the HEV case fatality rate is 0.5 to 3%. a higher mortality rate of up to 30% was observed in pregnant women. the HEV genome consists of positive-sense single-stranded RNA. ORF1 codes for nonstructural proteins, ORF2 codes for a structural protein, and ORF3 codes for a multifunctional phosphoprotein. numbers denote the predicted boundaries of the different regions of the Sar55 strain of genotype 1 hepatitis E virus. methyl transferase (MT), papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), proline-rich hinge domain, X domain, RNA helicase, and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (16) polyprotein processing is carried out by virus-encoded proteases. in most positive-sense RNA viruses, polyprotein processing is carried out by virus-encoded proteases. polyprotein processing occurs only in the context of virus replication (28) this may be due to interactions of viral and cellular factors. host proteases have also been proven to play crucial roles in the processing of viral proteins. a putative factor Xa cleavage site and two thrombin cleavage sites on pORF1 are highly conserved throughout HEV genotypes. the thrombin and factor Xa cleavage sites on pORF1 are highly conserved throughout HEV genotypes. Thrombin and factor Xa are serine proteases known as prothrombin and factor X. prothrombin is cleaved into active thrombin (MM of 32 kDa) by factor Xa in the plasma (37). factor Xa triggers thrombin activation and release, which further converts soluble fibrinogen to insoluble fibrin. Thrombin has proinflammatory effects mediated by activation of protease-activating receptors on the surface of monocytes, lymphocytes, endothelium, and dendritic cells (36). both factor Xa and thrombin belong to the family of vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors characterized by the NH2-terminal domain of G-carboxyglutamic acid (Gla domain) in and factor Xa cleavage sites in pORF1 are essential for HEV replication in cell culture. we analyzed proteases having cleavage sites on pORF1 of HEV. both thrombin and factor Xa cleavage sites are conserved across HEV genotypes. thrombin and factor Xa cleavage sites are essential for HEV replication in cell culture. thrombin and factor Xa cleavage sites are present on pORF1. this may be due to inability of thrombin and factor Xa to cleave and activate pORF1 functional domains in mutant replicons. amino acids [aa] 622 to 984 of ORF1 and helicase-RdRp (Hel-RdRp; aa 994 to 1356 of ORF1) proteins were thus expressed as N-terminal His-tagged recombinant proteins of 40 kDa in bacteria. the proteins macro-Hel and Hel-RdRp bear thrombin cleavage sites at amino acid positions 848 and 1220, respectively. the expressed fusion proteins were incubated for 4 h with bovine thrombin in thrombin cleavage buffer. thrombin and factor Xa have been well studied for their roles in the blood clotting pathway. thrombin and factor Xa must be associated with Huh7-S10-3 cells. total RNA was isolated form of Huh7-S10-3 cells. RT-PCR was carried out using specific primers. lysis was done in 100 l of passive lysis buffer, and 20 l of cell lysate was added as a test sample. the assay included specific substrates for thrombin and factor Xa bearing the respective cleavage sites. the cleavage product emits fluorescence, which is an indicator of the protease activity. immunoblotting showed bands corresponding to full-length prothrombin (70 kDa) along with smaller fragments of 43 kDa, 36 kDa, and 22 kDa, suggesting intracellular processing of prothrombin. benzamidine hydrochloride (Ben-HCl) is a cell-permeable serine protease inhibitor. fluorogenic assay to check effect of Ben-HCl treatment on intracellular thrombin and factor Xa activity in Huh7-S10-3 cells. cells were harvested at 48 h posttreatment, and lysate from treated or untreated cells was incubated with thrombin or factor Xa fluorogenic substrate. values plotted are means of three independent experiments. more than 95% cell viability was observed in inhibitor-treated cells. ORF1 polyprotein processing is one of the earliest events to occur during the HEV replication cycle. thrombin and factor Xa are essential for HEV replication in cultured cells. a 10 pM concentration was used in all further siRNA experiments. for both thrombin and factor Xa siRNAs, the maximum reduction in the intracellular activity of the target protein was found at 24 h of posttransfection. capped transcript of pSK-HEV2-Rluc was transfected 24 h post-siRNA transfection in Huh7-S10-3 cells. cells transfected with scrambled (SC) siRNA, factor Xa siRNA, or thrombin siRNA were harvested at 3 days posttransfection. the mean numbers of Renilla luciferase units from three independent experiments were converted to percentages. replicon mutants lacking either one of the thrombin cleavage sites or the factor Xa cleavage site were generated using site-directed mutagenesis. a dual-luciferase assay was carried out to detect replication in terms of Renilla luciferase activity at 3 days posttransfection. Thrombin cleaves at predicted cleavage sites on HEV pORF1 in vitro. truncated pORF1 fragments were digested in vitro with thrombin. the proteins macro-Hel and Hel-RdRp bear thrombin cleavage sites. an N-terminal His-tagged digestion product of 25 kDa was detected by western blotting using anti-His antibody. the results indicate that thrombin is capable of cleaving HEV pORF1 by thrombin. prothrombin and factor X mRNAs were detected in cells using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) the presence of prothrombin and thrombin was detected by Western blotting. it can be concluded that prothrombin is processed inside the cells. the human prothrombin gene was cloned into pCDNA3.1. the protein was overexpressed in Huh7-S10-3 cells. western blotting was carried out to detect processing of exogenously expressed FLAG-prothrombin in Huh7-S10-3 cells. thrombin and factor Xa in Huh7-S10-3 cells after HEV RNA transfection. we cloned an N-terminal FLAG-tagged human prothrombin gene. transient expression and processing of prothrombin were confirmed by immunoblotting using anti-FLAG antibody. untreated cells were treated with 4 mM Ben-HCl for 1 h followed by HEV RNA transfection at 37\u00b0C. untransfected cells which were not treated with Ben-HCl were kept as controls. a cell viability assay was performed after 24 h of RNA transfection in a 96-well plate using alamarBlue reagent. cells were harvested at 3 days posttransfection. a dual-luciferase assay was performed to check HEV replication. more than a 50% reduction in Renilla luciferase units in cells treated with Ben-HCl. cells were harvested at 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and 48 h posttransfection of siRNA. there was no significant difference in the effects of 10 pM and 20 pM siRNAs. for both thrombin and factor Xa siRNAs, the maximum reduction in the intracellular activity of the target protein was found at 24 h of posttransfection. thrombin siRNA was transfected into Huh7-S10-3 cells. cells were harvested at 6, 12, 24, and 48 h posttransfection. lysates were incubated with thrombin or factor Xa fluorogenic substrate. all positive-sense RNA animal viruses exhibit nonstructural polyproteins. the presence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the hallmark of positive-sense RNA viruses. pORF1 polyprotein processing occurs only in the context of virus replication or only to a minimum degree and is very tightly regulated. we hypothesize the existence of certain cellular factors required to trigger HEV polyprotein processing. we could observe the cleavage of pORF1 in vitro by thrombin and factor Xa. cleavage occurs in a chronological manner, regulating the release of pORF1 functional domains. this is evident in replication of alphaviruses, where nonstructural proteins are synthesized as a polyprotein. active thrombin and factor Xa were believed to be present in plasma or on the surface of platelets. clotting factors like thrombin and factor Xa are also synthesized in liver cells as zymogens. the presence of intracellular thrombin has been shown in brain cells. thrombin and factor Xa are required only in the initial stages of HEV replication. a reduction in the activities of intracellular thrombin and factor Xa was also observed in Huh-S10-3 cells treated with Ben-HCl. pET-28a (Novagen) cloned regions of pORF1 containing the first thrombin cleavage site (at R848) spanning amino acids 622 to 984 of pORF1. a second cleavage site (at R1220) spanning amino acids 994 to 1356 of pORF1 were cloned.
