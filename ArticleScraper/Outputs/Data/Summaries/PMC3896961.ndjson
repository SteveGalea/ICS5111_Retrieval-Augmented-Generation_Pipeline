{"summary": "the importance of understanding genetic sequences coupled with the difficulty of working with such immense volumes of DNA sequence data underscores the urgent need for supportive visual tools. graphical representation is well regarded which can offer visual inspection of data and provide simple way to facilitate the similarity analysis and comparison of DNA sequences. es, and D/D matrices, to weigh the similarities/dissimilarities among the complete coding sequences of -globin genes of different species. in this article, we propose a new 2D graphical representation of DNA sequences based on triplets. in this article, we present a new concept of \u2018weight\u2019 for 64 triplets and a new concept of \u2018weight deviation\u2019. corresponding triplets of DNA are illustrated in Table 2. corresponding triplets of DNA are illustrated in Table 2. corresponding triplets of DNA are illustrated in Table 2. we define a new mapping to map each of these triplets into a different weight. if the corresponding codons of X1 and Y2 code the same amino acid, then there shall be | (X1) (Y1)| | (X2) (Y2)|. codons of every amino acid are reordered, so the first codon of alanine's (GCT) we design the detailed mapping rules of as illustrated in Table 3.

WD A, B = i = 1 64 X i Y i T i 64 (2) satisfies the fact that the smaller the weight deviation between the two DNA sequences A and B, the higher the degree of similarity of A and B. basing on the similarity matrix (Table 5) constructs a phylogenetic tree, which is shown in Figure 4. human, gorilla, and chimpanzee are the most similar species pairs. the pairs are gorilla-chimpanzee (with weight deviation of 1.1266), human-gorilla (with weight deviation of 4.3359) and human-chimpanzee (with weight deviation of 5.2500) are the most similar species pairs. the pairs like human-gorilla and human-chimpanzee are the two most similar species pairs when adopting (A) the method of our work, (C) the method of [5], (C) the method of [5], and (D) the method of [7], which is in accordance with the fact that gorilla and chimpanzee are the two most closest species of human. however, when adopting (E) the method of [9], the most similar species pair is human-goat,"}
