{"summary": "the cases of HFRS in china account for nearly 90% of all HFRS cases worldwide. HTNV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA genome. HTNV was the first hantavirus described and was isolated in 1978. seven species of hantaviruses have been identified in china. only HTNV, which is carried by Apodemus agrarius, and Seoul virus are associated with HFRS. disease caused by HTNV is more clinically severe than that caused by SEOV. qRT-PCR assay uses fluorescent dye that directly binds to the amplified double-stranded DNA sequences. the fluorescence signal is proportional to the amount of PCR products accumulated in the reaction tubes. cDNA was synthesized using viral RNA as the template and a combined, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) cRNA with a length of 499 bp was synthesized using the cDNA as template by in vitro transcription. the external standard curve was generated by plotting the Ct values versus serial dilutions of the HTNV cRNA templates. specificity of the SYBR Green I-based one-step qRT-PCR assay was highly specific for detecting HTNV because RNA samples from SEOV and other viruses were not amplified during the assay. only a single sharp peak at 84\u00b0C was visible in the melt peak chart. serial dilutions of the HTNV cRNA standards ranging from 1106 to 110-1 copies/l were amplified using the SYBR Green I-based one-step qRT-PCR assay in duplicate. the minimum detection limit of the qRT-PCR assay was 10 copies/l. assay Copy numbers of HTNV cRNA standards (copies/l) 1.00E+07 1.00E+06 1.00E+05 1.00E+04 1.00E+03 1.00E+02 1.00E+01 intra-assay Ct values. all 27 HFRS patients showed positive serum IgM and/or IgG test results for hantavirus antibodies.

HTNV infection was monitored by indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) using mouse anti-NP mono-antibody and fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody. the cell monolayer was lysed by three freeze-thaw cycles and centrifuged at 4,000 g for 10 min. the viral RNA (60 l) was eluted and stored at -80\u00b0C until HFRS patients classified as mild, moderate, severe, and critical. the viral RNA extraction procedure was same as those described above. the clinical information about the HFRS patients was also collected and documented. the first-strand cDNA master mix (20 l) was prepared as follows: 2 l of template RNA was mixed with 1 l of random primer (0.2 g/l), 4 l of 5 Reaction Buffer, 1 l of RiboLock RNase Inhibitor (20 u/l), 2 l of 10 mM dNTP Mix, 1 l of RevertAid M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (200 u/l HTNV cRNA was processed twice with DNase I (TaKaRa Biotechnology, Dalian, China) to remove residual DNA. the cRNA transcripts were finally dissolved in 40 l of RNase-free water. the cRNA stock solution was serially diluted and stored at -80\u00b0C until use. 12.5 l of 2 One-Step SYBR RT-PCR Buffer, 1 l of each primer (0.4 M) and 7.5 l of RNase-free water in 8-strip tubes. the forward primer, 5\u2019-AAGCATGAAGGCAGAAGAT-3\u2019 (position of 594 to 614), and the reverse primer, 5\u2019-TAGTCCCTGTTTGTTGCAGG-3\u2019 (position of 811 to 830) were synthesized and purified optimization of the SYBR Green I-based one-step qRT-PCR assay Different parameters, such as the gradient of annealing temperature, the gradient of primer concentrations and amounts of cRNA templates in 25 l of reaction volume, were tested for the optimization of the amplification of specific HTNV products.
