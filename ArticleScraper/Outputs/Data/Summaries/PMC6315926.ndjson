RNA-seq [9,28] RTA T1.2; 50S 1 RNA-seq, ribosomal profiling [9,28] miR/K13/72/LANA ALT; K12.5 10.1; 9.9 Genome-tiling microarray [26] EBV EBER1 0.167 La, L22, hnRNPD RNA-seq [30,31,32,33,34] EBER2 0.172 La, nucle hnRNP D RNA-seq [39,43] HSUR3 0.075\u20130.106 Sm RNA-seq [39,43] HSUR6 0.075\u20130.106 Sm RNA-seq [39,43] HSUR7 0.075\u20130.106 Sm RNA-seq [39,43] gammaherpesviruses establish latency as a strategy for avoiding host immune surveillance and fusing tampering with interferon signaling and cellular response genes establishes lncRNAs as essential modules of escape strategies used by viruses to avoid antiviral pathways. Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) polyadenylated nuclear (PAN) RNA expression has been shown to interfere with the ability of transcription factors to activate the interleukin-4 (IL-4) promoter. domain II is characterized by a flexible conformation, which is likely to accommodate long-range tertiary interactions (e.g., formation of the ENE triple helix) the secondary structure of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus polyadenylated nuclear RNA is represented in the middle with color-coded domains. the presence of PAN RNA in the cytoplasm may be explained by a potential protein coding capacity. they observed initiating ribosomes at the PAN start codon, elongating ribosomes throughout the body of the transcript, and the accumulation of releasing ribosomes at the stop codon [9] PAN interacts with the poly(A) binding protein C1 (PABPC1), which relocalizes to the nucleus during the lytic phase of KSHV infection. this relocalization is directly caused by the shutoff exonuclease (SOX) protein, which downregulates the expression of host mRNAs and upregulates levels of PAN RNA [56]. ALT is a 10 Kb polyadenylated early lytic transcript expressed antisense to the major viral latency transcripts encoding LANA and the viral microRNAs. ALT is on the same strand and is co-terminal with a bicistronic lytic transcript containing ORF K14 (v-OX2) and ORF74 (vGPCR, viral G protein-coupled receptor) the EBERs are the most abundantly expressed nuclear ncRNAs in EBV-infected cells. gene deletion in EBER1/2-minus EBV bacterial artificial chromosomes shows no loss of viral latency establishment or tumorigenic potential. both EBERs are shorter than a typical lncRNA at 180 nts each. feron-inducible protein kinase R (PKR) and the association of La antigen with the EBER 3\u2032 polyuridylate stretch. the latter interaction has been proposed to dampen the recognition of a small fraction of cytoplasmic EBER1 by RNA sensors. the exogenous delivery of EBER1 has been shown to induce the expression of interferon-related genes and inflammatory cytokine genes. EBER1 binds to the La protein (green) via the 3\u2032 polyuridylate stretch (purple) EBER2 participates in the formation of a ternary complex with PAX5 (red), which involves host proteins (orange and green) and a nascent transcript (blue) expressed from the terminal repeats (TR) of the latent EBV genome. this interaction influences genome packaging and induces lytic gene expression, resulting in EBV reactivation PKR dimerization is inhibited in the presence of either EBERs or VAI/II. in vivo studies using multiple phosphorylation state-specific antibodies to monitor PKR activation within cells in response to interferon. BHLF1 is 2.5 kb in length and has an unusually high GC content. sisRNA-2 is produced during most onogenic phase of EBV latency (III) and folds into a thermodynamically stable 586 nt hairpin that contains intermittent bulges between canonically paired regions. similar thermodynamically stable hairpins have also been found in viral transcripts of other EBV strains, murine herpesvirus 4 and in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of some human transcripts. AR is thought to bind both lncRNAs at the FR regions, leading to the extensive \u201chyperediting\u201d of the hairpins. both oriPtL and oriPtR also interact with the multifunctional paraspeckle protein NONO, suggesting they comprise a part of the paraspeckle-based innate antiviral immune pathway. pathogenesis of MHV-68 in mice mimics that of EBV/KSHV infection in humans. the transcription utilizes the second type of RNA polymerase III (pol III) promotor system, comprised of three overlapping A box elements (TRGYNNARNNG) and a B box (RGTTCRANTCC), which are separated from one another by 30\u201360 nts. the promoter sequences recruit transcription factors while simultaneously containing the D- and T-loops sequences that make up the vtRNA. a transcript retaining a stem-loop would be expected to interact with components of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) machinery. a multitude of additional functions have been ascribed to TMER4. each of these functions is essential for MHV-68 pathogenesis and early detection. HSURs have common features with small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) they are transcribed by RNA pol II in the nucleus and exported to the cytoplasm. they associate with Sm core proteins and acquire a trimethylguanosine 5\u2032 -end cap before being imported back to the nucleus. HSURs have highly conserved regions responsible for binding of host miRNAs. HSUR1 reduces miR-27 levels in infected marmoset cells through target RNA-directed miRNA degradation. HSUR2 acts as a tether that recruits the Ago\u2013miR-142-3p and Ago\u2013miR-16 complexes to cellular mRNAs that encode pro-apoptosis factors. these complexes then induce the silencing of these tethered mRNAs and thus prevent apop s are key modulators of viral pathogenesis and replication. they represent an as of yet unexplored opportunity for pharmacological intervention. the currently available therapeutic options targeting gammaherpesviruses are limited by the continual emergence of resistant strains. PAN RNA has been shown to be the most abundantly expressed viral transcript in KSHV-lytically infected cells, but also in KSHV-associated tumors. targeting PAN can lead to the disruption of viral latency, and combing such approach with currently available antivirals might be an effective strategy for eradication of KSHV infection. lncRNA docking onto the protein surface can be sequence- or structure-dependent. small molecules offer the advantage of good absorption, distribution, and oral bioavailability. they bind RNA by virtue of secondary or tertiary structure, as opposed to sequence. in this review, we have deduced multiple examples of gammeherpesvirus-encoded lncRNA directly involved in viral lytic reactivation. targeting them with therapeutics may lead to viral reactivation. recent developments in the field of host lncRNA deregulation by gammaherpesvirus latency-associated factors suggest that the therapeutic targeting of these interactions may also be feasible. gammaherpesvirus-encoded lncRNAs require a comprehensive understanding of their structure to create an effective approach against viral infection and associated diseases. targeted lncRNAs must also be molecularly accessible and unobstructed by scaffolding contacts with other molecules that could potentially hamper the effective targeting. 2\u2032-hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension takes advantage of chemical probes that target single-stranded or structurally unconstrained nucleotides. modified nucleotides are detected as internal miscoding nucleotides during reverse transcription followed by massively parallel sequencing. RNA antisense purification (RAP) is used to purify a target lncRNA in complex with other RNAs, proteins and DNA. the 5-methylcytosine (m5C, purple) uses bisulfite conversion that causes non-methylated cytosines to be converted to guanine. the m6A, 5-methylcytidine, inosine, pseudouridine, and m1A are present in lncRNAs and influence metabolism, stability, structure, and function. scriptomic modifications might affect RNA structure and function during viral replication and pathogenesis. this information would contribute greatly to the unraveling of novel modes of action by lncRNAs."}
