{"summary": "human coronaviruses are large enveloped singlestranded RNA viruses that can infect both humans and a variety of domestic animals causing respiratory and enteric illness. there has been renewed interest in human coronaviruses (HCoV) as a cause of some of these infections. samples had previously been screened using an indirect immunofluorecence assay. hMPV was also tested for using reversetranscriptionPCR. RNA was extracted from 200 l of sample using the Seek Viral RNA kit. 5 l outer product and inner primers described by Smuts et al. 9 The 1b and 1a PCR products were 169 and 520 bp respectively. the 1a amplicons were sequenced directly and the nucleotide sequences were deposited into GenBank (EU477762\u2013EU477770). the HIV status of only those children from 2004 was known. 4/5 HCoVNL63infected children from this year were HIVpositive. a diagnosis of pneumonia or lower respiratory tract infection was made in six (67%) children. respiratory samples that had previously been screened for HCoVNL63 were also tested by RTPCR for HCoVNL63. the role and clinical significance of the recently identified human bocavirus 11 and polyomaviruses 12, 13 in respiratory disease is still under investigation. children in both 2003 and 2004 with similar low prevalence rates of 08%. this finding is lower than that reported in previous studies where detection of HCoVNL63 ranged from 1% to 73% 6, 7, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20. higher prevalences of 88% and 93% have also been reported. HCoVNL63 infections appear to be seasonal; 67% of infections occurred during autumn. no HCoVNL63 infection was detected during the winter months in either 2003 and 2004. NL63 infection and croup has been made 23 but it could not be determined if any of the samples were from children with croup. this study was funded by the Poliomyelitis Research Foundation (Grant number 05/09) a novel coronavirus associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome in humans. a previously undescribed coronavirus associated with respiratory disease in humans. allander T, Andreasson K, Gupta S et al.
