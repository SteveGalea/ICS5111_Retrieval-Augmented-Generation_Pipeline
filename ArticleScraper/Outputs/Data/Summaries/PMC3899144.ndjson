{"summary": "the best strategy to prevent pathogen mucosal infection is to target early infection in mucosal sites. most microbial pathogens gain access to their host through mucosal surfaces and therefore mucosal immune responses function as a first line of defense. the most attractive advantage of flagellin as adjuvant is its plasticity for generation of antigen-flagellin fusion proteins. two formulations of flagellin and targeted antigen fusion proteins are currently used: fusion to the C-terminus of flagellin or replacing the D3 domain to preserve greater TLR5 agonist efficacy. the hypervariable region domains D2 and D3 retained the TLR5 agonist function of flagellin. the hypervariable region was functionally dissociated from the TLR5-activating domains. the hypervariable region was replaced by HIV-1 p24. flagellin KFD-p24 3D (with D2 and D3 domains replaced) manifested partially preserved TLR5 agonist efficacy. IL-8 and (C) MCP-1 in cell culture supernatants of Caco-2 cells 6 h post stimulation were tested. splenocytes, which can be activated through the TLR5- signaling pathway in vivo, were selected initially as an ex vivo immunocyte model. the activity of KFD-p24 3D was much lower, but dose-dependent stimulation occurred similarly to that for KF-p24 and KF. the activating potential of KFD-p24 3D could also be observed on DCs separated from neck-associated lymph nodes and mesenteric lymph nodes. cells and supernatants were separately harvested for analysis 20 h after stimulation of splenocytes separated from nave BALB/c mice. p24, p24 plus KF, KF-p24 or KFD-p24 3D showed about a 2-log reduction in the generation of KF-specific serum IgG (Fig. 3A), serum IgA (Fig. 3B) and mucosal IgAs. the replacement of the hyper-variable domains D2 and D3 reduced by more than 95% the immunogenicity against full-length flagellin KF protein. p24- and KF-specific antibody responses after intranasal immunization. BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally with 5 g p24, 5 g p24 plus 5 g KF, 10 g KF-p24 or 10 g KFD-p24 3D at 0, 4th, and 8th weeks. IL-6, KC, and TNF- were detectable in BALFs until 24 h after flagellin administration. responses peaked at 4 h, at which time KFD-p24 3D induced lower responses in all three cytokines than did KF-p24. intranasal administration of KFD-p24 3D attenuated the loss in body mass. intranasal administration of 250 g of p24, KF-p24 or KFD-p24 3D induced no change in levels of serum transaminase ALT or AST. intranasal administration of 250 g of KFD-p24 3D induced no change in levels of serum transaminase ALT or AST, while 250 g of KF-p24 produced a 5-fold increase in ALT and a 3-fold increase in after intra peritoneal administration, we observed similar effects on IL-6 and KC in serum (Fig. S2A-D) at the high dose, KFD-p24 3D induced much less of a systemic inflammatory response than did KF-p24. replacement of hypervariable region domains D2 and D3 retained the TLR5 agonist function of flagellin. the hypervariable region was functionally dissociated from the TLR5-activating domains. the hypervariable region was functionally dissociated from the TLR5-activating domains. flagellin KFD-p24 3D manifested partially preserved TLR5 agonist efficacy. IL-8 and (C) MCP-1 in cell culture supernatants of Caco-2 cells 6 h post stimulation were tested. splenocytes, which can be activated through the TLR5- signaling pathway in vivo, were selected initially as an ex vivo immunocyte model. the activity of KFD-p24 3D was about 10 times less than that of KF-p24. cells and supernatants were harvested for analysis 20 h after stimulation of splenocytes separated from nave BALB/c mice in A\u2013E or from C57BL/6 mice background in F and G. CD86 expression levels for gated 7AAD- CD11chigh splenic DCs after 0.01\u201310 nM KFD-p24 stimulation. serum IgG (Fig. 3A), serum IgA (Fig. 3B) and mucosal IgAs (data not shown) compared with both full-length KF plus p24-mixed protein and full-length KF-p24 fusion protein. this showed that the replacement of the hyper-variable domains D2 and D3 reduced by more than 95% the immunogenicity against full-length flagellin KF protein. BALB/c mice were immunized intranasally with 5 g p24, 5 g p24 plus 5 g KF, 10 g KF-p24 or 10 g KFD-p24 3D at 0, 4th, and 8th weeks. time-course of KF-specific or p24-specific IgG titers in serum at 6th and 10th weeks. IL-6, KC, and TNF- were detectable in BALF until 24 h after flagellin administration. responses peaked at 4 h, at which time KFD-p24 3D induced lower responses in all three cytokines than did KF-p24 in serum 4 h after intranasal administration. intranasal administration of 250 g of p24, KF-p24 or KFD-p24 3D induced no change in levels of serum transaminase ALT or AST. intranasal administration of 250 g of KFD-p24 3D induced no change in levels of serum transaminase ALT or AST, while 250 g of KF-p24 produced a 5-fold increase in ALT and a 3-fold increase in KFD-p24 3D induced much less of a systemic inflammatory response after intra-nasal administration than did KF-p24. C57BL/6 mice were treated intranasally with 250 g of p24, KFD-p24 3D or KF-p24. a series of KF-derived recombinant proteins were designed and expressed. results showed about 10%, 30% and 90% antigenicities were located on domains D0/D1, D3 and D2/D3, respectively. some others reported a flagellin with truncated variable region incoperated into HIV VLPs as adjuvant was more effective in inducing HIV-specific mucosal IgA responses. complete or partial deletions of the hypervariable domain decreased the flagellin\u2019s antigenicity with no apparent effects on the production of IL-8 and CCL20 and the flagellin\u2019s adjuvanticity. however, some other groups reported that complete or partial deletions of the hypervariable domain caused reduced productions of IL-8 and TNF-. the most successful replacement case so far is replacing the D3 domain of flagellin with influenza viral haemagglutinin globular head domain. the vaccination of this study was administered subcutaneously, which did not show any data on IgA responses. however, it is plausible to speculate the mechanisms by which KFD-p24 3D induced the biased responses. proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines may influence the local IgA production. the NLRC4 pathway, which could be activated by cytosolic flagellin in macrophages,42,43 may also involve in the antibody responses by intranasal immunization. it was reported in the clinical trial that high-dose flagellin could induce severe systemic inflammation, which might in turn result in transient liver injury. ellin-induced systemic inflammatory responses, even at an ultra-high dose, remains unknown. underlying mechanism for this reduction remains unknown, though we may speculate its relationship with its relatively lower TLR5 agonist efficacy and the changed cytokine profile. plasmid pNL4\u20133- derived HIV-1 p24 clones were cloned into restriction enzyme sites (NdeI and XhoI) of the pET-30a-c (+) vector (Novagen) the hypervariable region-deleted clones KFD3 were generated by linking (NcoI and BamHI restricted) the plasmid KFD3 into a pET-28a-c (+) vector (Novage the recombinant proteins were purified by affinity chromatography on a Ni\u2013NTA column (Qiagen) and dialyzed with PBS at 4\u00b0C.
