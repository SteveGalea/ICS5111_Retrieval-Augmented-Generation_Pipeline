{"summary": "93 of these 258 children, follow-up serum samples were obtained 5\u20138 years later. 115 serum samples from healthy medical students were collected after informed consent was obtained. the study was reviewed and approved by the Ethics Committee of Turku and Helsinki University hospitals. fresh cells were infected 3 times every third day by using virus medium. VP2-containing Sf9 cells were harvested on day 3. cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cutoff absorbances for negative and positive IgG EIA results were 0.154 (mean + 3 SD) and 0.188 (mean + 4 SD), respectively. cutoff values were calculated from IgM EIA absorbances of 5-year follow-up samples of 61 children who were IgG positive 5 years earlier. logarithmic regression analysis was used for categoric data. patients and samples Acute-phase (at the time of admission) and convalescent-phase (2 weeks later) serum samples and NPA samples at the time of admission were obtained from 259 children. 93 of these 258 children, follow-up serum samples were obtained 5\u20138 years later. fresh cells were infected 3 times every third day by using virus medium. VP2-containing Sf9 cells were harvested on day 3. cell pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cutoff values were calculated from IgG EIA absorbances of the first serum sample obtained at admission of 34 children who had no IgM or maternal (waning) IgG against HBoV. cutoff absorbances for negative and positive IgG EIA results were 0.154 (mean + 3 SD) and 0.188 (mean + 4 SD), respectively. parvovirus B19 serologic analysis was conducted by using commercial (Biotrin, Dublin, Ireland) and in-house EIAs (18,20). logarithmic regression analysis was used for categoric data. results qPCR Complete sets of HBoV qPCR results for NPAs and serum samples were available for 258 children.
