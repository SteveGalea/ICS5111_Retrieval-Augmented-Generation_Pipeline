{"summary": "the best condition for generating LCLs was 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 20% fasting blood sugar, and RPMI 1640. results: best condition for generating LCLs was 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 20% fasting blood sugar, and RPMI 1640. LCLs are used to produce reference HLA typed cells for use in functional and serological studies, extensively. they were also used in the management of large amounts of DNA for genetic analysis of complex conditions in population and family disease collections. human immortal blood lymphocytes were purified to obtain excessive load of virus to estimate the number of inflexible cells. the cells were purified to allow direct deduction of the number of inflexible and growing cells after infection. the produced lymphoblastoids has been used as control in many laboratories. production and Infection with Epstein\u2013Barr virus 0.5 ml of product of B95 cells were added into two wells of a 24-well plate. 100 l of cyclosporin A stock, diluted 1:50 in RPMI, were added. 100 l of penicillin/streptomycin diluted 1:50 in RPMI were added. after 5\u20137 days, the 75 cm2 flask was filled with 15 ml of fresh complete medium. 20 ml of culture was centrifuged and the supernatant was removed in order to freeze in liquid nitrogen. these processes were repeated until 107 cells/ml were acquired. 15 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) were added and reserved at room temperature for 30 min. after centrifugation, the buffy coat was removed and the volume was increased to 50 ml associated with PBS, then it was spin at 600 g at room temperature for 10 min. cells were added to a 25 cm2 tissue culture flask containing complete RPMI and cultured to obtain 2 106/ml cells. s were grown for 5 or 7 days and when the medium turns yellow, cells were collected and poured off into two 25 cm2 flasks. after a week, cells were harvested by pouring off 8 ml medium into one 75 cm2 flask and then it was filled with up to 25 ml medium. after 5\u20137 days, the 75 cm2 flask was filled with 15 ml of fresh complete medium and return to the incubator again. BS including 10%, 15%, 20%, and 25% were used for culturing lymphoblastoids. the best temperature was 37\u201337.5\u00b0C (P 0.05). the number of cells produced in each temperature is summarized in Table 1. the sample number 29 is homozygous for mutation, because the mutant primers have a band and normal primers has no band. the samples number 15 and 27 are heterozygous for mutation, because the mutant primers have a band. the best conditions for generating LCLs were 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 20% FBS, and RPMI 1640. the best conditions for generating LCLs were 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2, 20% FBS, and RPMI 1640."}
