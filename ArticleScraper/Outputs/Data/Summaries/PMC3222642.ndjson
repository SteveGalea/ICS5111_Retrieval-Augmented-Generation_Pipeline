{"summary": "the importance of transmission via fomites is unclear. we therefore measured the viability over time of two H1N1 influenza strains. virus genome was measured by RT-PCR; plaque assay was used to assess survival of viable virus. the potential for transmission of influenza by indirect contact is linked to the ability of virus to survive in transmissible titres on commonly touched surfaces. the potential for transmission via fomites is linked to the ability of virus to survive in transmissible titres on commonly touched surfaces. however, few data exist on this subject. the time from deposition to recovery was not known. RT-PCR is only useful to demonstrate the absence of virus. viable virus persists for several hours, rendering fomite transmission possible without re-inoculation. the laboratory adapted a/Puerto Rico/8/34 strain because of ready availability and robust, convenient assay systems with a wide dynamic range. we used an isolate of the current 2009 pandemic virus A/Cambridge/AH04/2009 (AH04) as a low passage history representative of a virus likely to be encountered in the current environment. human influenza A virus PR8 (Cambridge lineage) was grown in embryonated hens' eggs and harvested at a titre of 9108 pfu/ml. for inoculation of the surfaces, the virus was diluted 110 in 1% BSA and serum free media. this represented a viral titre approximating 1.5108 TCID50/ml. the AH04 stock contained 6.5108 genome copies/ml. for comparison, the PR8 stock had a genome titre of 1.61011 genome copies/ml. a cotton swab was moistened by dipping in 3 ml of virus transport medium. the remaining samples were kept in a plastic, lidded box at constant temperature and humidity. at 4, 9, 24, 48 and 72 hrs, further samples were taken and stored. the virus did not survive in detectable amounts for more than 24 hrs. initial experiments with PR8 virus also showed that loss of virus on the swab was not a major factor. cells were examined blind by two people and scored semi quantitatively for the presence of infected cells using a standardised schema. the literature indicates immunofluorescence to be at least as sensitive in general as plaque assay [13], [18], [19]. 1% BSA had the largest effect on titre and duration of survival, followed by the bovine mucin. a clinical isolate designated influenza A/Cambridge/AHO4/2009 (AH04) was passed once in MDCK cells and then grown in Caco-2 cells (colorectal adenocarcinoma cells, ATCC HTB-37TM) this virus does not form discrete plaques in MDCK cells and could therefore not be titred by this method. a cotton swab was moistened by dipping in 3 ml of virus transport medium (VTM, Remel, UK) and then wiped carefully in 6 different directions for 1 minute across the top of the surface. after this, the swab was placed into the tube containing the residual (3 ml) volume of VTM and vortexed for 1 minute. the remaining samples in the plate were kept in a plastic, lidded box at constant temperature and humidity supernatant virus was first allowed to amplify by inoculation into 1106 MDCK cells and incubation for 48 h. after virus absorption, the cells were overlaid with 1 ml serum free DMEM media containing 1 g/ml Worthington's trypsin and 0.14% BSA. the following day they were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in PBS, permeabilised by the addition of 0.2% Triton 100 in P a droplet was then titred for virus genome by quantitative RT-PCR. on most surfaces, the viral genome persisted well, with only around a 10\u2013100 fold drop from the initially recoverable titre after 24 h. the exceptions were unsealed wood surfaces where both viruses lost genome titre rapidly and on pine surfaces became undetectable after a few hours. log10 reduction in genome copy number with respect to input inoculum. values plotted are the log10 reduction in genome copy number with respect to the input inoculum. ted are the log10 reduction in genome copy number with respect to input inoculum. 100% recovery would have resulted in a titre of 6.5105 genome copies/ml. the lower limit of detection was 20 copies/ml.
