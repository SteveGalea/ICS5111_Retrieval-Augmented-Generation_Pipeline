{"summary": "in humans, infectious diseases are responsible for 15 million of 57 million annual deaths in a global population of 6.2 billion people[1] in the united states, each year, approximately 25% of physician visits are attributable to infectious diseases, with direct and indirect costs estimated at more than $120 billion[2]. each year, about 2 million people die from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), 1.7 million people die from tuberculosis (caused by a mycobacterium, Mycobacterium tuber an EID can affect all types of eukaryotic organisms. it is surrounded by uncertainty and anxiety, real or perceived, as to its evolutionary potential. this definition includes the resurgence of endemic diseases in more sensitive populations. all these diseases are among the diseases that have marked the history of infectious diseases. they remain etched in the collective subconsciousness of the people as a threat for the survival of human societies. they remain etched in the collective subconsciousness of the people as a threat for the survival of human societies. the epidemic of mad cow disease has caused 182 500 confirmed cases of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, or prion disease, in the UK and the ban on bovine products. the emergence of new pathogens affecting humans has been found true with the marburg virus epidemic in 1967, the Lassa virus in 1969, the Rotavirus in 1973, the Ebola virus in 1976, the Hantaan virus in 1977, the influenza A/H5N1 virus in 1997, the most of the emerging pathogens in humans originate from zoonosis. these cases may illustrate the diversity of situations encountered. these cases may illustrate the diversity of situations encountered. simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) have adapted to a new host, man. the combination of density of people in ever-growing cities and unsafe sexual practices helped the transmission of HIV among groups of individuals. the fact that this virus is a Lentivirus has completely hidden epidemic in the face of the world. this last situation is perfectly illustrated by the example of the Chikungunya Alphavirus (CHIKV) epidemic in the Indian Ocean islands in 2006 and the first cases in southern Europe. combination of different factors such as urbanization and deforestation is expected to have influenced the emergence or re-ermergence of vector-borne diseases such as Yellow fever. malaria, a human disease caused by a mosquito-borne infectious parasite of the genus Plasmodium, is the most important vector-borne disease. the number of people affected (more than 220 million people) and the large number of casualties (about 800 000 deaths/year), the vector-borne viruses (arboviruses) are clearly the most numerous insect-borne pathogens. the DEN epidemic occurred in Greece in 1927 and 1928 affecting more than 1 million people. this arbovirus outbreak killed 1500 infected persons far from a tropical area. conditions necessary for arbovirus outbreaks include adequate populations of reservoir hosts, vector mosquitoes, and appropriate climatic conditions for transmission. resurgence is exactly what happened in the CHIKV-induced DEN-like epidemic in the Reunion Island in 2005-2006. CHIKV fever is characterized by sudden onset, chills and fever between 39\u00b0C and 40\u00b0C, headache (70%), nausea/vomiting (60%), persistent myalgia/arthralgia (40%), and maculopapular rash (60%). CHIKV-associated syndrome differed from DENV-syndrome by the absence of fatalities. CHIKV associated with a fatal hemorrhagic form was described once in india in 1964. one case of a child who died from CHIKV infection in ceylon was also documented in 1967. CHIKV is fatal for a low percent (around 0.5%-1%) of infected patients. outbreaks of CHIKV have occurred throughout africa and Asian countries. re-emergence was unpredictable, with intervals of 7 to 20 years between consecutive epidemics. up to 8068 cases were reported between 2001 and 2003. a second outbreak occurred at the end of December 2005 and the first couple of months of 2006. a very fast increase in the number of infected persons of more than ten times (about 186 000 cases) was observed and 93 patients died from CHIKV. by mid-March, about 214 000 persons had been infected in the Reunion Island, 148 of them died after infection. this adaptation of a mosquito is interesting and troubling because it opened the door to new epidemics. this adaptation of a mosquito is interesting and troubling because it opened the door to new epidemics. this adaptation of a mosquito is interesting and troubling because it opened the door to new epidemics. two domestic cases of CHIKV and DENV transmission were reported in south of France in 2010. the two autochthonous cases of CHIKV infections occurred in the town of Fr\u00e9jus at monthly intervals. mosquitoes Aedes albopictus arrived in France with the motorway transport between Italy and France. west Nile virus is frequently associated with ornithophilic Culex spp. mosquitoes, which transmit it to domestic and migratory birds. in 2003, 7 human cases were reported in the Var district in Southeastern France. one may question what will be the impact of the introduction of Aedes albopictus in southern France on the potential spread of west Nile virus. CHIKV may survive in wildlife species through constant transmission cycles moving in epizootic waves. humans entering areas where infected mosquitoes circulate may serve as incidental hosts for the mosquitoes and thus become infected. CHIKV episodes were restricted to diffuse epidemics in africa. CHIKV that circulated in india after the Reunion Island outbreak was genetically related to that circulating in the Indian Ocean Islands. this mutation favors a transmission of the pathogen by Aedes albopictus. a warming climate that would facilitate the introduction of mosquitoes in areas not yet infected represents a serious hypothesis for the development of arboviruses. a single V226A mutation by the Reunion Island isolates coincides with the acquisition of a dependence on cholesterol in the target cell membrane[51] and their sensitivity to lysomotropic agents during infection of mammalian cells[52]. research on vector control using environmentally safe insecticides will be required to interrupt the transmission of arboviruses. we know relatively little about the cycle of CHIKV replication in mammalian cells and insect cells. it remains necessary to conduct experimental work to better understand the cycle. understanding of each stage of the cycle, the molecular crosstalk between the pathogen and the host may offer a new avenue to fight the pathogen. CHIKV-disease and DENV-disease accounted for frequent misclassification and some under-reports of CHIKV fever in areas with endemic DENV. infection may have been mistaken for infections caused by related viruses, such as RRV[57], or O\u2019Nyong-nyong virus[58]. the need arose to establish a CRV when the crisis of CHIKV outbreak occurred in the Reunion Island. the main idea is to set up transdisciplinary approaches to diseases of wildlife and domestic animals. the CRV should be valuable platforms to conduct biosurveillance under a close working relationship with neighboring countries\u2019 governments. the operation of these facilities should be provided through the contributions of individual institution partners. it would be desirable to set up an African CRV, a Southeast Asia CRV, a Caribbean CRV, and a Mediterranean CRV."}
