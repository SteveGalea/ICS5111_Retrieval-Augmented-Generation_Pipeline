{"summary": "MERS-CoV virus is a novel betacoronavirus closely related to a virus (NeoCov) hosted by a bat, Neoromicia capensis. in 2015, the virus spread from the Middle East to south Korea which sustained an outbreak. phylogenetic analyses We calculated a phylogenetic tree from 100 genomic sequences of MERS-CoV hosted by humans and camels using NeoCov as the outgroup. the graph indicates places as nodes and transmission events as edges. betweenness centrality measures the number of shortest paths from all nodes to others that pass through the corresponding node. geographical spread of Mers-CoV based on transmissions identified in phylogenetic data Most important among the places in the MERS-CoV epidemic is Saudi Arabia. the united arab Emirates has a bidirectional connection with Saudi Arabia indicating the virus has spread between the two countries. mapping in this manner will miss many cases that are reported in the lean format. syndromic and pathogen genetic data can be used to imply a transmission pathway but it is hard to find epidemiological data in the public domain."}
