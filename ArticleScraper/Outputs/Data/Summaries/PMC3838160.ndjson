{"summary": "WSSV is the only species of the genus Whispovirus, family Nimaviridae. it is a large double-stranded DNA virus with a broad host range among crustaceans. the mechanism by which this virus modulates cellular pathways during infection remains to be explored. WSSV IE proteins IE1 and WSV056 are linked to the Rb-E2F pathway. both proteins contain a conserved LxCxE motif at the C terminus. both proteins contain a conserved LxCxE motif at the C terminus. us vannamei and reverse transcribed into cDNA by using an oligo(dT)18 primer. three pairs of primers were designed according to the sequences of two shrimp cDNA fragments similar to those for an Rb family protein. the amino acid sequence of lv-RBL was analyzed by NCBI BLAST software. the open reading frame (ORF) of lv-RBL was cloned into the pIEx-4 vector (Novagen) the open reading frame (ORF) of lv-RBL was cloned into the pIEx-4 vector (Novagen) cysteine in the LxCxE motif replaced by glycine. IE1 and IE1C216G mutant were cloned into the pIEx-4 vector. pIE-hRluc was cloned into pIEx-4 to generate the control plasmid pIE-hRluc. the proteins were separated in SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. the primary antibodies (monoclonal anti-FLAG M2 antibody, monoclonal anti-c-myc antibody, and monoclonal anti-HA antibody) were purchased from Sigma. the activity of the firefly luciferase reporter was correlated with the effect of specific experimental conditions. the activity of the firefly luciferase reporter was provided as an internal control. the experiments were repeated three times, and the standard deviations were calculated. the cellular DNA content was determined with a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. ten thousand events in the EGFP-positive gate were read for each sample. mofit LT software (Verity Software House) was used to determine the distribution of cells in each phase of the cell cycle.

Trichoplusia ni high five cells were grown in SFX medium (HyClone) at 27\u00b0C. high five cells were transfected with cellfectin II reagent. the supernatant was incubated with 30 l anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel overnight at 4\u00b0C with gentle rotation. the beads were washed sequentially with lysis buffer and washing buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.8, 15% glycerol, 250 mM KCl, 0.2 mM EDTA, 0.1% NP-40, 1 mM DTT, 0.5% PMSF) the vector pIEx-4 was used to normalize the amount of DNA in each transfection mixture. cells were harvested at 24 h p.t., washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and fixed with 70% ethanol at 20\u00b0C for 1 h. the shrimp Rb homolog comprises 1,080 amino acids (aa) and contains a pocket domain formed by domain A (aa 393 to 588) and domain B (aa 766 to 923) this protein is more closely related to mammalian Rb-like proteins p107 and p130 than to pRB. amino acid sequences of IE1 and WSV056 were aligned using DNAMAN software (Lynnon Biosoft) the amino acid sequences of IE1 and WSV056 were aligned using their LxCxE motif. the C2H2 zinc finger motif is marked with asterisks. residue C55 is required for DNA binding. WSSV IE1 and WSV056 could affect the host Rb-E2F pathway. it is difficult to analyze the functions of WSSV IE1 and WSV056 in the natural hosts of WSSV because of the limited knowledge of the Rb-E2F pathway in crustaceans. the relative luciferase activity was indicated by the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to control Renilla luciferase activity. IE1 and WSV056 increased firefly luciferase levels in a dose-dependent manner. IE1 and WSV056 stimulated E2F1 activity in the cells and strongly induced the transcription driven by the PCNA promoter. mutant constructs pIE-IE1C216G and pIE-WSV056C217G were used as controls. pIEx-4 vector was used to normalize the amount of DNA in each transfection mixture. at 48 h p.t., cells were harvested with pIE-RBF1 and pIE-E2F1. IE1 and WSV056 were cotransfected with IE1 or WSV056. IE1 and WSV056 were coimmunoprecipitated with similar amounts of RBF1. IE1 and EGFP-WSV056 modulate cell cycle progression via binding to Rb protein. IE1 and WSV056 modulated cell cycle progression by binding to a cellular Rb protein(s). IE1 and WSV056 modulated cell cycle progression by binding to a cellular Rb protein(s) WSSV immediate early proteins IE1 and WSV056 share 56% identity. a search for motifs within these two proteins identified the LxCxE motif. a shrimp Rb homolog comprises 1,080 amino acids (aa) and contains a pocket domain formed by domain A (aa 393 to 588) and domain B (aa 766 to 923) both IE1 and WSV056 were physically associated with lv-RBL. immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that these two mutants no longer bound to lv-RBL. the amino acid sequences of IE1 and WSV056 were aligned. IE1 and WSV056 modulate the Rb-E2F pathway. it is difficult to analyze the functions of WSSV IE1 and WSV056 in the natural hosts of WSSV because of the limited knowledge of the Rb-E2F pathway in crustaceans. the activity of E2F1 was measured using a firefly luciferase reporter construct containing the Drosophila PCNA promoter that can be activated by E2F1 and repressed by RBF1 (23). the relative luciferase activity was indicated by the ratio of firefly luciferase activity to control Renilla luciferase activity. IE1 and WSV056 regulate the Rb-E2F pathway in Drosophila cells. mutants pIE-RBF1 (500 ng/well of a 24-well plate) and PCNA-luc (500 ng/well of a 24-well plate) were cotransfected with pIE-RBF1 (500 ng/well of a 24-well plate) pIE-RBF1 and pIE-E2F1 were cotransfected with IE1 or WSV056. the vector pIEx-4 was used to normalize the amount of DNA in each transfection mixture. at 48 h p.t., cells were harvested, the HA-tagged protein was immunoprecipitated with anti-HA affinity gel. IE1 and WSV056 modulate cell cycle progression via binding to Rb protein. IE1 and WSV056 expression caused a significant increase in the percentage of cells in S phase at 24 h p.t. DISCUSSION Viruses are tiny intracellular parasites that rely on the host machinery to complete their replication cycle. small DNA viruses such as adenovirus, papillomavirus, and polyomavirus encode no or very few proteins required for DNA replication. small DNA viruses such as adenovirus encode no or very few proteins required for DNA replication. WSSV is a large double-stranded DNA virus with a genome of about 300 kb. it encodes several proteins related to DNA replication (30, 31), including DNA polymerase (32), thymidine kinase (33), thymidylate synthase (34), ribonucleotide reductase large and small subunits (35), dUTPase (36), helicase (30), nuclea IE1 and WSV056 may activate E2F1 by sequestering RbF1 from E2F1. by binding to RBF1, IE1 or WSV056 substantially increased the portion of S-phase cells among the S2 cells. this correlated with a significant decrease in the number of cells in G0/G1 phase. IE1 and WSV056 are IE proteins expressed at the very beginning of viral infection (4, 5) they behave similarly in repressing Rb function and modulating cell cycle progression. despite their similarity in modulating the Rb-E2F pathway, WSSV IE1 may have additional (perhaps different) functions in the replication cycle of WSSV."}
