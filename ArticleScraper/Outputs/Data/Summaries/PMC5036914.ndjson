{"summary": "a prospective interventional trial of the impact of universal surgical mask usage on RVIs was conducted. the universal mask policy required all individuals with direct patient contact to wear surgical masks. similar masks have been shown to reduce aerosol shedding of both coarse (>5 m) and fine (5 m) virus particles. the HSCT unit switched from ammonia to bleach in march 2011. the HSCT unit switched from ammonia to bleach in march 2011. the HSCT unit switched from ammonia to bleach in march 2011. a study examining room disinfection protocols for contact isolation rooms. patients who received a transplant between 1 December 2003 and 30 November 2009 were considered the premask cohort. patients were observed from the start of conditioning (pretransplant preparative chemotherapy and/or radiation) to the completion of peritransplant care and discharge. there was no significant change in the number of beds in either the hematology/oncology unit or the bone marrow transplant unit through the course of the study. baseline characteristics, incidence of RVIs, percentage of positive test results, and deaths due to RVIs were examined using the 2 test or Fisher exact test, as appropriate. the number of intervals per patient ranged from 1 for a patient who had all procedures and treatment as an outpatient over the course of a single season to 19 for a patient who was in and out of the hospital. the primary endpoint was the incidence of RVI during the peritransplant period. incidence of PIV3 was examined as a secondary endpoint. the majority of RVIs fell into this category. isolation precautions include use of gowns, gloves, and surgical masks if patients have or are colonized with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) hand washing includes both washing with soap before entering the outpatient or inpatient hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) units as well as additional hand washing or hand sanitization with antibacterial alcohol-based foam. patient population Universal surgical mask usage was instituted 1 December 2009. all patients who received a transplant between 1 December 2003 and 30 November 2009 were considered the premask cohort. the mask cohort included all patients transplanted between 12 January 2010 and 11 January 2014. data was obtained from medical records, the Duke HSCT database and the Duke Enterprise Data Unified Content Explorer database. differences in categorical baseline characteristics, incidence of RVIs, percentage of positive test results, and deaths due to RVIs were examined using the 2 test or Fisher exact test. patients in the premask cohort were given a value of 0 for postintervention time. myeloablative conditioning, use of alemtuzumab, umbilical cord transplant, haploidentical transplant were only relevant for allogeneic HSCT (allo-HSCT), so a third level was added to these variables to indicate that an autologous HSCT (auto-HSCT) was performed. baseline Patient Characteristics Characteristic Study Group P Valuea Premask (n = 920) Mask (n = 911) Male sex 536 (58.3) 525 (57.6).78 Age, y, mean (SD) 50 (12.7) 54.7 (12.3).001 Age, y, median (range) 52 (19\u201379) 57 (18\u201381) Disease. the overall incidence of RVI dropped from 95 of 920 (10.3%) in the premask cohort to 40 of 911 (4.4%) in the mask cohort (P.001; Table 2). There was also a decrease in RSV (16/920 [1.7%] to 11/911 [1.2%]. the decrease in RVIs was significant among both allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT patients (64/378 [16.9%] to 24/289 [8.3%], P =.001) and auto-HSCT patients (31/542 [5.7%] to 16/622 [2.6%], P =.007) the decision to test for viral pathogens was dependent on patient signs and symptoms and clinician concern for viral infection. despite the increased sensitivity of PCR-based tests in the mask period, the proportion of positive test results was lower. time-series analysis to adjust for seasonal and yearly variations in the incidence of RVI. the dotted line represents when the universal surgical mask policy was instituted, after which the number of RVIs dropped significantly. parainfluenza virus predominated and tended to cluster in the summertime. mask vs premask (unadjusted) 0.484 (.347\u2013.675).001. adjusted model also controls for the time from the start of the study (1 December 2003) and the time from the start of the intervention (12 January 2010) in days. in the premask period, PIV3 among HSCT patients tracked closely with the PIV3 in the rest of the hospital. before universal surgical mask policy, HSCT patients accounted for 32% (76/233) of all hospital-wide PIV3 infections. this dropped to just 10.4% (20/192) after implementation (P.001). the mask cohort tended to be older (mean age, 55 vs 50 years, P.001) and included more patients with multiple myeloma (P.001); as a result, a greater proportion received auto-HSCT (622/911 [68.3%] vs 542/920 [58.9%], P.001) patients in the mask cohort were less likely to have received mismatched donor transplants (73/911 [25.3%] vs 133/920 [ data are presented as No. (%) unless otherwise indicated. overall incidence of RVI dropped from 95 of 920 (10.3%) in premask cohort to 40 of 911 (4.4%) in the mask cohort (P.001; Table 2). allo-HSCT, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant; auto-HSCT, autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplant. decrease in RVIs was significant among both allo-HSCT. allo-HSCT and auto-HSCT patients experienced large decreases in PIV3 (allo-HSCT: 49/378 [13.0%] to 12/289 [4.2%], P.001; auto-HSCT: 27/542 [5.0%] to 8/622 [1.3%], P.001) the rate of death secondary to RVI dropped in the mask cohort. mask use was estimated to reduce the risk of RVI by 60% after adjusting for covariates (P =.017). other significant variables were season, conditioning intensity, and GVHD. the adjusted model also controls for the time from the start of the study (1 December 2003) and the time from the start of the intervention (12 January 2010) in days. the unadjusted model includes only mask use. mask use was estimated to reduce the risk of PIV3 by 69% after adjusting for covariates (P =.016) mask use was estimated to reduce the risk of PIV3 by 69% after adjusting for covariates. standard preventive methods include strict hand hygiene, vaccination, active and early surveillance, and contact and droplet isolation of symptomatic patients. however, strategies that focus on symptoms do not address the prolonged asymptomatic shedding of RVIs in immunocompromised patients. the biggest impact was on PIV3, which made up the majority of RVIs. GVHD patients receive additional immunosuppression including corticosteroids and myeloablative conditioning were associated with fewer RVIs. our time-series analysis found a 60% decrease in the risk of RVIs in the mask period after accounting for the covariates of season and year. differences in detection methods in the premask period (predominantly viral culture and DFA) vs the postmask period (PCR) could impact the results. however, as PCR is known to be at least 30% more sensitive at detecting viral pathogens compared with culture, depending on the pathogen, without sacrificing specificity. universal surgical mask usage is associated with a significant decrease in clinically significant RVI, particularly PIV3. this suggests universal surgical mask usage could be a potent adjunct to standard infection control practices in bone marrow transplant units."}
