{"summary": "a cross-sectional nationwide telephone survey was conducted in the later stage of the 2009\u20132010 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) outbreak. the questionnaire identified the demographics, vaccination status of participants and all household members, barriers to non-vaccination, perceived threat, and preventive behaviors. in the high-risk group, the most important triggering event for vaccination was receiving a notice from a public health organization. the first case of pandemic influenza was confirmed in a 50-year-old woman who had returned from Mexico on may 1, 2009. by the end of October, the influenza-like illness prevalence rate peaked at 45 per 1,000 in the local community. a quarantine and isolation policy blocked introduction of the pandemic into the local community. study was conducted to understand the difference in vaccination coverage between high-risk and non-high-risk groups during the 2009\u20132010 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) in Korea. we investigated whether there was a difference between the groups concerning public perception and preventive behavior. questions in the first part included \u201cHow much of a health threat is posed by influenza infection\u201d and \u201cWhat made you get a vaccination\u201d. questions included \u201chow much of a health threat is posed by influenza infection\u201d. cross-sectional telephone survey This was a nationwide, population-based cross-sectional study. quota sampling was used to ensure that respondents were demographically representative of the general population. only one participant per household was asked to answer questions about his/her pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccination status. the priority groups for pandemic influenza vaccination include healthcare workers, children aged 7\u201318 years, children aged 6 months to 6 years, pregnant women, caregivers for infants aged 6 months, nursing home residents, military personnel, people aged 19\u201364 years with chronic medical disease. the study obtained ethics approval from the Institutional Review Board of Korea University. the mean age was 44.8915.18 years and 817 subjects (49.5%) were male. in total, 313 subjects were classified as high risk, being affected by diabetes (n = 67, 4.1%), cardiovascular disease (n = 66, 4.0%), lung disease (n = 30, 1.8%), malignancy (n = 14, 0.8%), chronic liver disease (n = 12, 0.7%), and rheumatologic disease (n = 8, 0.5%). 833 (50.5) Age groups (years) 0.001 19\u201329 22 (7.3) 278 (92.7) 300 (18.2) 30\u201339 30 (8.5) 325 (91.5) 355 (21.5) 40\u201349 33 (8.7) 346 (31.3) 379 (23.0) 50\u201359 26 (8.8) 269 (91.2) 295 (17.9) 60+ 144 (44.9) 177 (55.1) 321 (19.0) Age 65 years 122 (58.4) 87 (4 thirty-eight missing values were excluded from the analysis. e Exchange rate based on two million Korean won to US $1,830 and four million Korean won to US $3,660. 59 82 12 (25.6) 1,247 90 (7.2) 60+ 231 127 (55.0) 90 17 (18.9) Education levelc 0.001 Elementary school 118 64 (54.2) 42 10 (23.8) Middle school 53 20 (37.7) 84 7 (8.3) High school 65 30 (46.2) 415 43 (8.2) College/university graduate 74 28 (37.8) 767 53 (6.9) 0.001 Monthly incomed (million Korean won)e 1.99 174 90 (51.7) more than half of the respondents in the non-high-risk group believed they were healthy enough not to require vaccination (32.0%) or that they were not in a priority group (25.4%). there was no significant difference in preventive behaviors in both groups. the most significant factor influencing vaccination against pandemic influenza A was age 65 years (odds ratio [OR 5.84) 1,650 potential respondents participated in the telephone survey. the mean age was 44.8915.18 years and 817 subjects (49.5%) were male. in total, 313 subjects (19.0%) were classified as high risk. 255 (15.5) 1395 (84.5) 1650 Sex 0.207 Male 117 (14.3) 700 (85.7) 817 (49.5) Female 138 (16.6) 695 (83.4) 833 (50.5) Age groups (years) 0.001 19\u201329 22 (7.3) 278 (92.7) 300 (18.2) 30\u201339 30 (8.5) 325 (91.5) 355 (21.5) 40\u201349 33 (8.7) 346 (31.3) 379 (23.0) 50\u201359 26 (8 thirty-eight missing values were excluded from the analysis. e Exchange rate based on two million Korean won to US $1,830 and four million Korean won to US $3,660. 1 Male 151 72 (47.7) 666 45 (6.8) Female 162 76 (46.9) 671 62 (9.2) Age (years) 0.001 59 82 12 (25.6) 1,247 90 (7.2) 60+ 231 127 (55.0) 90 17 (18.9) Education levelc 0.001 Elementary school 118 64 (54.2) 42 10 (23.8) Middle school 53 20 (37.7) 84 7 (8.3) High school 65 30 (46.2) 415 43 (8. the reasons for not being vaccinated between the high-risk and non-high-risk groups are compared in Figure 2. Barriers to pandemic influenza A (H1N1) vaccination according to risk group. more than half of the respondents in the non\u2013high-risk group believed they were healthy enough not to require vaccination. the most common preventive behavior in the high-risk and non-high-risk groups was frequent hand washing (88.5% vs. 90.2%, respectively), followed by avoidance of the outdoors (48.9% vs. 46.4%, respectively), frequent use of ventilation (44.1% vs. 43.4%, respectively), and avoidance of those who were coughing (40.3% vs. 36.6%, respectively) there was no significant difference in the preventive behaviors in both groups (p flu vaccination 3.68 2.55\u20135.29 0.001 a Exchange rate based on two million Korean won to US $1,830. four million Korean won to US $3,660. vaccination coverage in adults aged >19 years was 15.5%. the difference in vaccination coverage between the high-risk group and the non-high-risk group was statistically significant. in pandemic influenza vaccination, vaccination campaigns targeted towards those at high risk were partially successful. despite these steps, pandemic influenza vaccination coverage in the high-risk group was lower when compared to seasonal influenza vaccination. the non-high-risk group considered receiving a notice from a public health organization the most important triggering event. this strongly indicates that public health organizations should publicize vaccination more actively. more than half of the respondents perceived pandemic influenza as more serious than seasonal influenza, and about 20% perceived pandemic influenza as a very severe disease. the high-risk group consisted of the elderly (aged >65 years) and people with chronic medical conditions. despite these limitations, this study does suggest that disseminating accurate information about influenza appears to be a valuable component for those at high risk."}
