{"summary": "IFITM3 is the only known protein for which a genetic polymorphism present in a significant percentage of the human population is associated with severe influenza virus infections [10,12,13,14]. ubiquitination increases the rate of IFITM3 turnover within the cell. phosphorylation at tyrosine 20 (Y20) inhibited IFITM3 ubiquitination. this led us to suggest that phosphorylation of Y20 may block an E3 ubiquitin ligase recognition signal. we chose to focus first on NEDD4, the prototypical member of this family. NEDD4 is reported to be inhibited by ISG15 [29,30,31], an IFN-inducible protein. we provide results demonstrating the ability of NEDD4 to ubiquitinate IFITM3. we identify a unique role for NEDD4 in decreasing steady state IFITM3 abundance. NEDD4 co-localizes with IFITM3 at lysosomes. NEDD4 overexpression increases IFITM3 ubiquitination. NEDD4 overexpression increases IFITM3 ubiquitination. FLAG-NEDD4 caused increase in IFITM3 ubiquitination while FLAG-SMURF1 and FLAG-SMURF2 were unable to robustly modify IFITM3. NEDD4 possesses a degree of specificity for IFITM3 that is lacking for CBL-B and the NEDD4-family members, SMURF1 and SMURF2. the IFITM3 PPxY motif shares its tyrosine with an overlapping Yxx motif known to be involved in the trafficking of IFITM3 from the plasma membrane to endosomes. a truncated form of IFITM3 missing its first 21 amino acids was, as expected, largely unaffected in terms of ubiquitination by overexpression of FLAG-NEDD4. sates were immunoprecipitated with anti-myc or anti-FLAG resin. Western blotting of cell lysates with anti-myc and anti-FLAG antibodies performed. co-immunoprecipitation was examined by Western blotting. murine (m)IFITM3 also possesses a PPxY motif. we tested the ability of NEDD4 to affect mIFITM3 modification. NEDD4 catalytic activity is required for IFITM3 ubiquitination. NEDD4 was incubated with purified NEDD4, enzymatic cofactors, and ubiquitin. we then re-immunoprecipitated IFITM3 and subjected it to anti-ubiquitin western blotting. NEDD4 is capable of robustly ubiquitinating IFITM3 in vitro. Western blotting of lysates from NEDD4 KO cells showed steady state IFITM3 levels as compared to WT cells. NEDD4 knockout decreases IFITM3 ubiquitination and increases resistance to viral infection. KO MEFs were subjected to anti-IFITM3, anti-NEDD4 and anti-actin immunoblotting to evaluate NEDD4 levels in each cell line and the effect of NEDD4 on endogenous IFITM3 levels. the indicated cell lines were infected for 24 h with influenza A virus (IAV) PR8 and X-31 strains at an MOI of 5. ror bars represent standard deviation of triplicate samples. predicted NEDD4 KO cells would be more resistant to influenza virus infection. NEDD4 KO MEFs were significantly less susceptible to infections with IAV. NEDD4 KO cells were knocked down for 24 hours prior to infection. knockdown of IFITM3 in both NEDD4 WT and KO MEFs resulted in an increase in influenza virus susceptibility. NEDD4 regulates cellular susceptibility to influenza virus infection. NEDD4 knockdown in human lung cells increases IFITM3 levels. NEDD4 knockdown led to a significant increase in endogenous IFITM3 compared to non-targeting control siRNA. NEDD4 knockdown led to a significantly greater resistance to IAV infection. cell lysates were subjected to anti-IFITM3 immunoblotting to evaluate endogenous IFITM3 levels with each treatment. we used chloroquine and bafilomycin, which inhibit endosomal and lysosomal acidification. treatment with leupeptin, an inhibitor of specific lysosomal proteases, resulted in a similar increase in IFITM3 levels. this is in contrast to the treatment of cells with the proteasomal inhibitor MG132. NEDD4 co-localizes with IFITM3 at lysosomes. a significant increase in ubiquitination was observed when HA-NEDD4 was expressed as compared to the transfection control. no increase in IFITM3 ubiquitination was seen upon overexpression of HA-tagged human NEDD4 (FLAG-NEDD4) on IFITM3 ubiquitination. a 17-20A mutant of IFITM3 showed less ubiquitination than WT IFITM3. the PPxY motif shares its tyrosine with an overlapping Yxx motif known to be involved in the trafficking of IFITM3 from the plasma membrane to endosomes. the PPxY motif is required for ubiquitination by NEDD4. HEK293T cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing myc-hIFITM3 or FLAG-NEDD4. western blotting of cell lysates with anti-myc and anti-FLAG antibodies was performed to confirm comparable protein loading. myc-hIFITM3 and FLAG-NEDD4 co-immunoprecipitated with one another. this interaction was greatly diminished between FLAG-NEDD4 and the P17,18A mutant of IFITM3. NEDD4-mediated IFITM3 ubiquitination is dependent upon NEDD4 catalytic activity. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-NEDD4 or a catalytically inactive HA-NEDD4-C867A mutant. cell lysates were probed with anti-NEDD4 antibodies to confirm expression of NEDD4 constructs. DD4 showed a preference for the K48 linkage in long polyubiquitin chains. NEDD4 ubiquitinates IFITM3 in vitro. NEDD4 knockout decreases IFITM3 ubiquitination. IFITM3 from NEDD4 KO cells was ubiquitinated much less than IFITM3 from WT cells. NEDD4 knockout decreases IFITM3 ubiquitination and protects cells from virus infection. WT and KO MEFs were infected with influenza virus 2011 isolates (IAV or influenza B virus (IBV)) or Sendai virus (SeV) at an MOI of 5 for 24 h or were infected with VSV G-pseudotyped retrovirus (VSV G-pseudo) for 48 h. cells were then fixed and stained with anti-influenza NP. retrovirus pseudotyped with the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein is also reported to be inhibited by IFITM3. the percent of NEDD4 KO cells infected with VSV G-pseudotyped virus was significantly less than WT cells. the pattern of virus restriction we observed is consistent with protection of NEDD4 KO cells by IFITM3. cells were transfected for 24 h with control siRNA (siCont) or siRNA targeting IFITM3 (siIFITM3) following siRNA treatment, cells were infected with influenza virus strain PR8 at an MOI of 10 for 24 h. NEDD4 knockdown in human lung cells increases IFITM3 levels and resistance to influenza virus infection. NEDD4 knockdown in human lung cells increases IFITM3 levels and resistance to influenza virus infection. A549 cells were transfected for 48 h with control siRNA (siControl) or siRNA targeting human NEDD4 (siNEDD4) cell lysates were subjected to anti-IFITM3 immunoblotting to evaluate endogenous IFITM3 levels. the degradative pathway involved in the turnover of steady state IFITM3 has not been previously investigated. NEDD4 is known to associate with the endosomal and lysosomal system. the amino acid Y20 within IFITM3 is involved in regulating IFITM3 ubiquitination [23], which led us to identify the involvement of the IFITM3 PPxY motif in its ubiquitination by NEDD4. the previously described role of the IFN effector ISG15 in inhibiting NEDD4 [29,30]. NS1 protein by the E3 ligase HERC5 blocks human ISG15 conjugation by preventing ISG15 interaction with the ISG15 activating enzyme UbE1L. high levels of IFITM3 attained after IFN stimulation result from both IFITM3 gene induction, as well as increased IFITM3 protein stability as result of ISG15 inhibition of NEDD4. current work is in contrast to a prior study that concluded the IFITM3 PPxY motif was not involved in regulating the levels or antiviral activity of overexpressed IFITM3 [36]. however, this previous work did not directly assess ubiquitination of IFITM3 upon mutation of the PPxY motif. ubiquitination has only subtle effects on total protein levels detected by Western blotting. NEDD4 KO mice are viable [57,55], and NEDD4 is naturally inhibited by ISG15 during virus infections [29,30]. NEDD4 is a novel strategy for preventing infection by influenza virus and other IFITM3-sensitive viruses through the increased accumulation of the antiviral restriction factor IFITM3. plasmids expressing HA-NEDD4 and HA-NEDD4-C867A were obtained from Addgene. plasmids expressing FLAG-NEDD4, FLAG-NEDD4-WW, and FLAG-SMURF2 were obtained from Addgene. hek293T cells were co-transfected overnight with plasmids expressing myc-hIFITM3 and FLAG-NEDD4. cells were lysed with 1% Brij buffer (0.1 mM triethanolamine, 150 mM NaCl, 1% BrijO10 (Sigma), pH 7.4) for Western blotting. lysate was set aside for each sample to evaluate expression of myc-hIFITM3, FLAG-NEDD4 and GAPDH as a loading control. immunoprecipitations were washed three times with lysis buffer and examined by Western blotting. in vitro ubiquitination HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with plasmid expressing HA-hIFITM3. 10% of the retrieved protein was used in each reaction containing 500 M ubiquitin or ubiquitin mutants. anti-LAMP1 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, catalogue no. sc-19992) and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Abcam, 1:1000) were diluted in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. cells were treated sequentially for 20 min at room temperature and washed five times with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. pLenti-CMV-GFP-puro (Addgene plasmid 17448, deposited by Dr. Eric Campeau) was generated by transfection of viral vector pLenti-CMV-GFP-puro. media was changed 18 h post-transfection, and media containing virus was then harvested 48 h post-transfection.
