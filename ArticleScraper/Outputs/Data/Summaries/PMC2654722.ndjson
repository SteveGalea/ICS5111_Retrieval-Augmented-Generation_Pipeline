{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses comprise over one-third of all virus genera. important human pathogens include hepatitis C virus (HCV), hepatitis C virus (SARS coronavirus), norwalk virus, west Nile virus, and the majority of common cold viruses. ation can be fully reconstituted in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae by expressing the viral RNA replication and/or capsid proteins together with one or more genomic RNAs [8],[9],[10]. the powerful techniques of yeast genetics and molecular biology have greatly facilitated the investigation of BMV replication and host-virus interactions. spherules in yeast cells that express only 1a are indistinguishable from spherules in yeast co-expressing 1a, low copy numbers of 2aPol, and genomic RNA3. similar spherules are induced in association with RNA replication by many other positive-strand RNA viruses [12],[23]. the manner by which 1a interacts with ER membranes to induce these membrane invaginations. a 105 amino acid (aa) region (aa 368\u2013472, previously designated region E, Fig. 1A) plays a major role in 1a-ER membrane binding. in this region, a stretch of 35 amino acids (aa 388\u2013422) is predicted to be predominantly helical. western blots using anti-gFP, anti-PGK, and anti-Dpm1p antisera show average flotation efficiencies based on three independent experiments. flotation efficiency was calculated as the percentage of total protein in the gradient that segregated in the top two fractions. aa 397\u2013406 in the peptide had a >80% probability to be in a helical structure. the resulting structure shows an -helical conformation for aa 397\u2013406, indicating that an amphipathic helix formed upon binding to the lipid membrane-mimicking SDS micelle. helix A is bound to 100 mM helix micelles. peaks arise from the amide moieties in the peptide. the assignments of peaks to particular amides are shown. 65% of the observed signals were assigned to specific atoms in the peptide. of these assigned signals, 80% were affected by the addition of 16-doxyl stearic acid (DSA), a paramagnetic molecule whose presence in SDS micelles causes nearby atoms' NMR signals to broaden and lose intensity. we tested the importance of these three leucines for helix A-mediated membrane association. wt18H-GFP again had 30\u201335% flotation efficiency, while single L to A mutations reduced this to 7\u201315%. mutating the more N-proximal L396 and L400 more severely reduced membrane association than mutating L407. this parallels the stronger micelle contact of the N-terminal half of the peptide. the contribution of helix A to membrane association of full-length 1a was assessed using biochemical and cell imaging approaches. helix A is required for efficient membrane association of full-length 1a. single position substitution mutants and double mutants K403/406A and K403/406R maintained full flotation efficiency. single and double mutations showed a slightly greater inhibition of membrane association in the context of full length 1a (63% for the double mutant in Fig. 5). this suggests residues outside of the 18 aa helix core might cooperatively influence membrane association. ocal fluorescence images showed similar staining throughout the cytoplasm for 1a triple mutant L396/400/407A and the K403/406E double mutants. helix A is crucial for effective membrane association and normal 1a localization to perinuclear ER membranes. helix A determines the type and ultrastructure of 1a-induced ER membrane rearrangements. 1a double mutant K403/406R produces much more numerous, somewhat smaller spherules than wt 1a. this phenotype is maintained in single mutant 1a K403R, but not 1aK406R. mutating the hydrophobic face of helix A in triple mutant 1a L396/400/407A or reversing the positive charge of the two lysines in double mutant 1a K403/406E abolishe single mutants 1a K403R and 1a K406R were generated and expressed in yeast cells. 1a K403R maintained this mutant phenotype while 1aK406R induced spherules with the frequency and size of wt 1a. these results show both that 1a-ER membrane association through helix A is crucial for 1a-induced membrane rearrangements. EM analysis showed that 1a T397A, 1a Y401A and 1a Y404A all were Class II mutants, inducing a plethora of small spherules like 1a K403R. spherules of wt frequency and size were produced by 1a bearing alanine substitutions at residues on the upper face of helix A. spherules of wt frequency and size spherule abundance in yeast cells expressing wt 1a was 5- to 7- fold higher than in cells expressing wt 1a. the average spherule diameter in cells expressing wt 1a was 66 nm. 8 204% 23% 100% 74% ER 1a Y401A 475% 698% 29% 478 203% 2% 100% 42% ER 1a Y404A 645% 578% 17% 498 167% 2% 100% 56% ER 1a K403R 581% 807% 6% 5510 214% 2% 100% 45% ER a (average number of yeast cells with a clear nucleus in the plane of section among a total of two hundred yeast cells sectione helix A mutations alter 1a's intrinsic functions for ER membrane rearrangement. wt 1a also recruits 2aPol to the RNA replication complex. this is mediated at least in part by a direct interaction between 1a's C-terminus and 2aPol. levels of cytosolic protein PGK were measured as a loading control. 1a, 2aPol, and PGK protein expression levels in yeast cells expressing either 1a alone, 2aPol alone, 2aPol and wt 1a, or 2aPol and class I 1a mutant derivatives abolished 1a-induced ER membrane rearrangement. the absence of 1a was mostly faint and diffusely cytoplasmic. the GFP-2aPol co-localized with the mutant 1a in typical partial to almost complete ring-like perinuclear ER structures. in contrast, in the presence of reduced membrane affinity Class I 1a mutants, GFP-2aPol accumulated in large cytoplasmic clusters. the half-life of RNA3 increases from 5\u201310 min in the absence of 1a to more than 3 hours in the presence of 1a. in yeast cells, the half-life of RNA3 increases from 5\u201310 min in the absence of 1a to more than 3 hours in the presence of 1a, which is reflected in a marked increase in RNA3 accumulation 20-fold. wild type 1a recruits RNA3 into a membrane-associated, nuclease-resistant state. wt 1a helix A mutations abolish BMV RNA replication in yeast. RNA3 transcripts are recruited into 1a- and 2aPol-containing replication complexes. class I and class II mutants in 1a helix A show opposite effects on 1a-associated intracellular localization, ER membrane rearrangements and stimulation of 2aPol and RNA3 accumulation. yeast cells expressing wt 1a, 2aPol and RNA3 supported efficient viral RNA replication in yeast and in a natural plant host of BMV, barley. yeast cells expressing 2aPol, RNA3 and either wt 1a or class I or class II 1a helix mutants were inoculated with in vitro transcribed wt or mutant RNA1 transcripts. rRNA levels in barley leaves 9 days post-inoculation with in vitro transcribed wt or mutant RNA1 and RNA2 and RNA3 transcripts. a stretch of 35 amino acids (aa 368\u2013472, previously designated region E, Fig. 1A) plays a major role in 1a-ER membrane binding. a putative amphipathic -helix core peptide of 18 amino acids (aa 392\u2013409) can be recognized. western blots using anti-gFP, anti-PGK, and anti-Dpm1p antisera show average flotation efficiencies based on three independent experiments. flotation efficiency was calculated as the percentage of total protein in the gradient that segregated in the top two fractions. ic helical cylinder with one side (the right side in Fig. 2) having a cluster of hydrophobic, non-polar residues including three leucines (L396, L400, L407) and two nearby positive-charged lysines (K403, K406) to test these predictions, we used NMR to resolve the structure of an 18 aa peptide. polar residues on one face of the helix suggest an amphipathic configuration. helix A is bound to 100 mM SDS micelles. peaks arise from the amide moieties in the peptide. experimental constraints All backbone atoms 0.2 All heavy atoms 0.9 Table 2 shows that 65% of the observed NMR signals were assigned to specific atoms in the peptide. of these assigned signals, 80% were affected by the addition of 16-doxyl stearic acid (DSA), a paramagnetic molecule whose presence in SDS micelles causes nearby atoms' NMR signals to broaden and lose intensity. wt18H-GFP again had 30\u201335% flotation efficiency, while single L to A mutations reduced this to 7\u201315%. mutating the more N-proximal L396 and L400 more severely reduced membrane association than mutating L407. this paralleled the stronger micelle contact of the N-terminal half of the peptide. helix A is required for efficient membrane association of full-length 1a. the contribution of helix A to membrane association of full-length 1a was assessed. single alanine insertions immediately downstream from L396 and L400 reduced flotation efficiency to levels similar to full helix A deletions. 403/406E single and double mutations showed a slightly greater inhibition of membrane association in the context of full length 1a (63% for the double mutant in Fig. 5), suggesting the possibility that residues outside of the 18 aa helix core might cooperatively influence membrane association. 1a has helix A-dependent and -independent modes of membrane association. but helix A is crucial for effective association of 1a with ER membranes. helix A and specific non-polar residues (K) in it support BMV RNA replication. EM images of membrane spherules or layers or absence thereof in yeast cells expressing wt 1a or 1a helix A mutants when expressed alone or when co-expressed with high levels of 2aPol. 1a double mutant K403/406R produces much more numerous, somewhat smaller spherules than wt 1a, and this phenotype is maintained in single mutant 1a K403R, but not 1aK406R. single mutants 1a K403R and 1a K406R were generated and expressed in yeast cells. 1a K403R maintained this mutant phenotype while 1aK406R induced spherules with the frequency and size of wt 1a. these results show both that 1a-ER membrane association through helix A is crucial for 1a-induced membrane rearrangements. spherules of wt frequency and size were produced by 1a T408A, at the C-terminal end of helix A, by 1a bearing alanine substitutions at residues on the upper face of helix A. spherules of wt frequency and size were produced by 1a T408A, at the C-terminal end of helix A, and by 1a A395S (results not spherule abundance in yeast cells expressing wt 1a was 5- to 7- fold higher than in cells expressing wt 1a. the average spherule diameter in cells expressing wt 1a was 66 nm, but was only 40\u201355 nm.

GFP-2aPol co-localized with wt 1a in typical partial to almost complete ring-like perinuclear ER structures. in the presence of reduced membrane affinity Class I 1a mutants, GFP-2aPol accumulated in large cytoplasmic clusters containing a significant fraction of the mutant 1a. the remaining 1a was distributed diffusely over the cytoplasm. in yeast cells, the half-life of RNA3 increases from 5\u201310 min in the absence of 1a to more than 3 hours in the presence of 1a. the effects of the Class I and Class II mutations on 1a stimulation of RNA3 accumulation were opposite to each other and opposite to the effects of each mutant on 2aPol. wild type 1a recruits RNA3 into a membrane-associated, nuclease-resistant state. without wt 1a, RNA3 remained at the bottom of flotation gradients. at least 80% of RNA3 segregated with the membrane fraction in the top gradient fractions. class I and class II mutants in 1a helix A show opposite effects on 1a-associated intracellular localization, ER membrane rearrangements and stimulation of 2aPol and RNA3 accumulation. yeast cells expressing wt 1a, 2aPol and RNA3 supported efficient viral RNA replication (Fig. 10A) yeast cells expressing 2aPol, RNA3 and either wt 1a or class I or class II 1a helix mutants were inoculated with in vitro transcribed wt or mutant RNA1 transcripts. rRNA was measured as a loading control in (A) and (B) 7-day old leaves of barley plants were inoculated with in vitro transcribed wt or mutant RNA1 transcripts. previously, we mapped major 1a ER membrane association-mediating sequences between aa 368 and 478 (region E) and membrane association enhancing sequences in upstream region D [24]. auxiliary sequences in region A, B, and D were not. helix A is critically involved in 1a-induced membrane association and rearrangement. lysines at positions 403 and 406, which can potentially interact with the negatively charged polar head groups of the lipid bilayer, were mutated to glutamic acids to change positive charge to negative charge. membrane association was also affected, but to a lesser extent. positions of class I and class II mutations are mapped in yellow and purple. phosphorylation at these residues is due to lack of flanking phosphorylation site consensus sequences. neither mutations T397D, Y401E and Y404E affected spherule formation, although they did render 1a defective in RNA replication. however, alanine substitutions in this same T-Y-Y face of helix A revealed an entirely new 1a mutant phenotype. class I 1a mutants that did not induce ER membrane invaginations failed to mediate significant recruitment of template RNA3. class II 1a mutants that form hyper-abundant spherules enhance RNA3 accumulation to even higher levels than wt 1a. phenotypes reveal significant insights into pathways by which RNA replication complexes assemble. class II mutants produce significantly more spherules than wt 1a. helix A mutations alter the size of the induced membrane spherules. this affects 1a-membrane and/or 1a-1a self-interactions. class II 1a mutants retain efficient ER membrane association. mutants in triple-leucine class I cluster fail to induce ER invaginations. this implies that 1a-2aPol interactions occur most efficiently and perhaps exclusively prior to spherule formation. class I and class II 1a mutant phenotypes showed strong correlation between spherule formation and recruiting and protecting RNA3 templates. this implies that RNA template recruitment is either closely linked to or subsequent to spherule formation. helix A has crucial roles in directing and/or regulating multiple essential 1a functions in RNA replication complex assembly and function. picornavirus 2C protein is implicated in amphipathic helix-modulated interactions with other viral RNA replication proteins. the primary membrane association function of helix A resides in a hydrophobic face comprised primarily of three leucines at aa positions 396, 400, and 407. mutation of these leucines to alanines greatly diminished helix A- and full-length 1a-mediated membrane association. lysines at positions 403 and 406, which can potentially interact with negatively charged polar head groups of the lipid bilayer, were mutated to glutamic acids to change positive charge to negative charge. membrane association was also affected, but to a lesser extent. positions of class I and class II mutations are mapped in yellow and purple. mutations T397R, Y401R and Y404R affected spherule formation. however, they did render 1a defective in RNA replication. characterization further extended the opposing nature of the class I and class II 1a mutant phenotypes to regulation of ER membrane association. class I 1a mutants that did not induce ER membrane invaginations failed to mediate significant recruitment of template RNA3. class II 1a mutants that form hyper-abundant spherules enhance RNA3 accumulation to even higher levels than wt 1a. phenotypes reveal significant insights into pathways by which RNA replication complexes assemble. spherules suggest that this part of helix A affects 1a-membrane and/or 1a-1a self-interactions that determine the diameter of the inner protein shell. such altered interactions, together with the reduced volume of Class II spherules, explain how Class II 1a mutants produce significantly more spherules than wt 1a from a similar or only slightly increased number of 1a proteins. class II 1a mutants retain efficient ER membrane association. mutant 1a proteins must remain exposed at the cytoplasmic surface of the ER membrane or dissociate entirely from the membrane. this implies that 1a-2aPol interactions occur most efficiently and perhaps exclusively prior to spherule formation. helix A has crucial roles in directing and/or regulating multiple essential 1a functions in RNA replication complex assembly and function. this includes binding to membranes, inducing membrane curvature, and interacting with itself, 2aPol and viral RNA templates. helix A may affect one or more additional 1a functions required for RNA synthesis, such as the peripheral membrane association. picornavirus 2C associates with membranes through an amphipathic helix. it induces membrane rearrangements, has NTPase activity and conserved helicase motifs. nsP1 may embody common principles extending across important virus groups.
