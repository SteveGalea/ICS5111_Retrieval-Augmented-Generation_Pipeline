{"summary": "viral infections of the respiratory tract are responsible for significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and parainfluenza viruses are the most common aetiological agents in such infections. a total of 7544 healthy, nonpregnant adults aged 18 to 65 years were enrolled in a placebocontrolled phase IV efficacy trial of a licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine. participants met the case definition of at least one respiratory symptom (cough, sore throat, runny nose or nasal congestion) and at least one systemic symptom (fever 378\u00b0C, feverishness, chills or myalgia) participants were reimbursed for time and inconvenience according to approved practices by their respective ethics committees. a nose or throat specimen was collected using a COPANTM dry flocked swab and initially transported to a local holding laboratory where it was frozen. samples were tested for viruses including influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza viruses (1,2,3), adenoviruses, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) no virus detected, picornaviruses, influenza viruses (A and B), coronaviruses and other (hMPV, parainfluenza viruses, RSV, adenoviruses, bocaviruses and polyomaviruses) for each virus group, associations with host and external variables were described. icacy trial of a licensed seasonal trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluvax\u00ae, CSL Ltd, Parkville, Vic., Australia) conducted between March and November 2008 at 21 study sites in Australia and New Zealand. main exclusion criteria were: allergy to any of the vaccine components; medically unstable clinical condition; planned or current pregnancy; lactation; history of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome; confirmed or suspected immunosuppressive condition; current or recent immunosuppressive therapy; concurrent participation in a clinical study procedures At the ILI visit, a nose or throat specimen was collected using a COPANTM dry flocked swab and initially transported to a local holding laboratory. samples were shipped on dry ice in several consignments to the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory. participants were given a questionnaire requesting information about the clinical course of their illness. no virus detected, picornaviruses, influenza viruses (A and B), coronaviruses and other (hMPV, parainfluenza viruses, RSV, adenoviruses, bocaviruses and polyomaviruses) for each virus group, associations with host and external variables were described. a \u2018symptom score\u2019 was calculated by scoring one point for each symptom. no virus detected, picornaviruses, influenza viruses (A and B), coronaviruses and other (hMPV, parainfluenza viruses, RSV, adenoviruses, bocaviruses and polyomaviruses) symptom score The symptom scores developed by Hayden et al. 29 in trials of the influenza drug Oseltamivir, while ideal, were considered too labour intensive to be applied in this protocol. a virus sample was associated with 322 of these questionnaires (Questionnaire Data set). a number of participant factors were associated with increased probability of completion of the questionnaire. Virus detection A known virus was identified from 284 of 643 (442%) specimens in the Virology Data set. the overall distribution of viruses isolated (by group) varied substantially by month of collection. picornaviruses the most common in may, coronaviruses isolated predominantly in June\u2013August and influenza viruses detected primarily in August\u2013September. 53 of 103 (515%) of specimens tested positive (data not shown) compared with the fourth (the reference site) where 53 of 103 (515%) of specimens tested positive (data not shown) participants tested positive for influenza viruses were significantly less likely to have been immunised than the reference (virus negative) population (OR = 052 (031, 087) P = 001), indicating a protective effect (against ILI) of the vaccine. the median duration of illness was 6 days (range 1, 51) with no significant variation by virus type. the median time spent away from usual activity was 2 days (range 0, 14), with an increase in the mean of 13 days (05, 22; P = 0001) in episodes associated with isolation of influenza. bronchitis (9%) and \u2018chest infection\u2019 (12%) were more common in participants with influenza than overall (cf, 24% and 74%, Table 5). bronchitis (9%) and \u2018chest infection\u2019 (12%) were more common in participants with influenza than overall.
