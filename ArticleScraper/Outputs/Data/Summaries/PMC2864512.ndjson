{"summary": "most chemotherapeutic agents enter normal tissues in the body with indiscriminate cytotoxicity and do not preferentially accumulate at tumor sites. at times the dose reaching the tumor may be as little as 5% to 10% of the doses accumulating in normal organs. in this way, the interstitial fluid pressure in solid tumors is higher than in normal tissues. inhibiting angiogenesis Virtually every conventional cytotoxic drug has been found to be antiangiogenic in in vitro and in vivo models. one treatment approach known as metronomic therapy uses frequent administrations of low-dose antiangiogenic agents to destroy vessels in tumors while decreasing the toxicity to normal tissues. the antiangiogenic agent bevacizumab (Avastin) has been used with some success to treat advanced colon cancer. endothelial cells can acquire cytogenetic abnormalities while they are in the tumor microenvironment [25, 26], says jain. antiangiogenic therapy decreases IFP within the tumor allowing better penetration by chemotherapeutic agents. ligands that target tumor blood vessels can be used as molecular targets for antitumor treatment. phage-displayed random peptide libraries have helped researchers map epitopes. peptides are fused with a coat protein of bacteriophage and displayed on the surface of the virion. phage clones display Pro-Ser-Pro, a motif crucial to peptide binding. several tumor homing peptides have been found to bind to blood vessels in surgical specimens of human cancer. they have also been found to home to tumor tissues of different human tumor xenografts. these studies found a greater correlation between increased tumoral accumulation of the targeting liposomes and antitumor efficacy than the accumulation of free drugs. liposome-encapsulated doxorubicin significantly improves therapeutic index of doxorubicin in preclinical and clinical studies. one study found no cardiotoxicity in 40 patients receiving cumulative doses of 500\u20131500 mg/m2 of doxorubicin [62], suggesting that little of the liposomal drugs will be leaked to the circulation system during its journey to the tumor tissues. passive tumor targeting by liposomes can increase the concentration of drugs in solid tumors by as much as ten times, compared to free drugs [70] passive tumor targeting by liposomes can increase the concentration of drugs in solid tumors by as much as ten times, compared to free drugs. anticancer drugs can be enhanced by coupling targeting moieties to the surface of liposomes to promote selective binding to tumor-associated antigens. this drug delivery system has a higher drug-to-carrier ratio than immunoconjugates and multivalent presentation of ligands. antibodies that bind to tumor-specific antigens have so far yielded little success as a drug delivery system for solid tumors. method [13, 79] and pH gradient method [80] can encapsulate weak bases such as doxorubicin or vinorelbine into the liposomes with more than 95% efficiency. schedule-dependent drugs such as vinca alkaloids, topotecan, and 5-fluorouracil are also potential candidates for liposomal delivery. liposomes are localized to a solid tumor, the drug must be released. the rate of active drug's release into tumor cells, not the total drug concentration in the tumor tissues, is critical for measuring the actual bioavailability of the liposomal drug. some liposomes have not been found to have greater therapeutic efficacy than passive liposomal drugs. liposomes are bound and internalized by tumor cells or tumor-associated endothelial cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. liposomes are fused with the low pH compartments of the endosomes. the use of drug-encapsulated liposomes with ligands allows us to destroy both tumor blood vessels and tumor cells. advances in nanotechnology and molecular biology are moving us closer to developing an ideal smart nanodrug delivery system. such smart nanodrug delivery systems will allow accurate, specific, and noninvasive disease treatment, early diagnosis, and monitoring. combining ligands that specifically bind to cancer cells (including cancer stem cells) and tumor blood vessels with multifunctional liposomal drug delivery systems may help improve the effectiveness of cancer treatment and minimize side effects traditionally associated with chemotherapy."}
