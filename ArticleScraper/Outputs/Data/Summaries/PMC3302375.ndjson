{"summary": "TEXT Emerging and (re)emerging viruses pose major threats to public health. animals, and particularly wild animals, are thought to be the source of the majority of emerging infections. a thorough understanding of virus diversity in wild animals provides epidemiological baseline information about potential pathogens. meles meles VS4700005 F 800 8,000 Myoviridae Anelloviridae (torque teno virus) 544/41 VS4700006 M 4,820 3,810 Myoviridae Microviridae Reoviridae (Bombyx mori cypovirus) 2,668/49 Circoviridae (columbid circovirus) 1,039/97 (Sclerotinia scle the viral-particle-containing filtrates were digested with a mixture of DNases and RNases. first- and second-strand syntheses and random PCR amplification were performed as described previously. random PCR products from the RNA and DNA fractions were pooled and purified using the MinElute PCR purification kit (Qiagen) eukaryotic viruses with homology to kobuvirus from the Picornaviridae family, bocavirus from the Parvoviridae family, torque teno virus from the Anelloviridae family, and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum hypovirulence-associated DNA virus 1 (SSHADV-1) from the Geminiviridae-like family were detected. some of the eukaryotic viruses showed a high identity to rolling circle amplification was employed to acquire complete viral genome sequences from pine marten rectal swab VS4700004 and European badger rectal swab VS4700006 (7, 26) the anellovirus genome sequence from sample VS4700004 was designated MmTTV1 (for Martes martes torque teno virus 1). torque teno tamarin virus SoTTV2 (Saguinus oedipus torque teno virus 2) is the only exception with 55.3%, which is at the border of defining a new genus. phylogenetic trees were generated using the ORF1 amino acid alignments. pairwise sequence distance between ORF1 nucleotide sequences for indicated anelloviruses Virus Pairwise sequence distance (%) SoTTV2 AtTTV3 CfTTV10 TbTTV14 MmTTV1 SoTTV2 0 49.7 57.3 59.7 55.3 AtTTV3 0 60 62.8 60 CfTTV10 0 62.3 58.1 TbTTV14 0 60.9 MmTTV1 0 To obtain insight about the prevalence two viral genomes were obtained by rolling circle amplification from sample VS4700006. one virus showed homology to a recently described geminivirus-related DNA mycovirus SSHADV-1 (42) the fact that the identified European badger (Meles meles) fecal virus (MmFV) was amplified by rolling circle amplification suggests that it contains a circular single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) genome. the REP proteins of SSHADV-1 and MmFV are most closely related to the REP proteins of geminiviruses. the capsid proteins show >70% or >90% pairwise distance to the corresponding proteins of geminiviruses. thus, SSHADV-1 and MmFV most likely belong to a new virus family that we provisionally named Breviviridae, after the Latin word brevis for short. the second characterized virus from European badgers showed some homology to viruses in the family Circoviridae. the meles meles circovirus-like virus (MmCVLV) contains two overlapping ORFs in the same orientation, encoding a putative REP and capsid protein. specific primers VS656 (5\u2032-TTCCAGGAGGATGTTTCATTGG-3\u2032) and VS657 (5\u2032-TTCCAGGAGGATGTTTCATTGG-3\u2032) were used to obtain a 1,048-bp PCR amplicon of the genome region encoding VP2. the obtained pine marten bocavirus VP2 protein sequence was aligned to the corresponding VP2 protein sequences of other bocaviruses in Gen HBoV1, human bocavirus 1 (AB480186); HBoV2, human bocavirus 2 (FJ973558); HBoV3, human bocavirus 3 (GQ867667); GBoV1, gorilla bocavirus 1 (NC_014358); porcine bocavirus (HM053693); canine minute virus (FJ899734); bovine parvovirus (NC_001540); pine marten bocavirus ( pine marten anellovirus belongs to a new genus that we provisionally name Xitorquevirus in analogy to the classification of torque teno viruses in nine genera named Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma-, Delta-, Epsilon-, Eta-, Iota-, Theta-, and Zetatorquevirus. a high prevalence of TTV has also been described in apparently healthy humans, tupaias, tamarins the geneBank accession numbers for the genomes of martes martes torque teno virus 1 (MmTTV1), European badger (Meles meles) fecal virus (MmFV), meles meles circovirus-like virus (MmCVLV) and the partial genome of pine marten bocavirus are JN704611, JN704610, JQ085285, and JQ085286. most of the identified sequences were of ence-associated DNA virus 1 (SSHADV-1) from the Geminiviridae-like family was detected. eukaryotic viruses with homology to Bombyx mori cypovirus from the Reoviridae family, canine distemper virus from the Paramyxoviridae family, and torque teno virus from the Anelloviridae family were detected. anellovirus genome sequence from sample VS4700004 was designated MmTTV1 (for Martes martes torque teno virus 1) and was determined by Sanger sequencing of full-length genomes obtained by rolling circle amplification. a taxonomic proposal submitted to the international committee on the taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) proposed that genera in the family Anelloviridae are defined as having >56% divergence in the nucleotide sequence of ORF pine marten torque teno virus species identified in pine martens belongs to a new genus. the black boxes represent ORF1 to ORF3.

JN704610) and MmCVLV (GenBank accession no. JQ085285), and selected circular ssDNA viruses in the Gemini-, Nano-, and Circoviridae families. the MmCVLV genome does contain the conserved nonanucleotide sequence (CAGTATTAC) that is thought to play a role in circovirus replication. the genome organization of MmCVLV resembles the type III circovirus-like genomes characterized from the environment and rodents. pine marten bocavirus VP2 protein sequence was aligned to the corresponding VP2 protein sequences of other bocaviruses in GenBank using Clustal X2 (20. phylogenetic analyses showed that the pine marten bocavirus is most closely related to porcine bocavirus and canine minute virus. the majority of bacteriophage sequences in pine martens and European badgers belonged to the order Caudovirales and to single-stranded DNA viruses in the family Microviridae. the presence of insect viruses (cypovirus) and mycoviruses (MmFV) may be attributable to the host diet. degenerate universal anellovirus PCR (27) on rectal swabs suggested that anelloviruses are prevalent among pine martens. a high prevalence of TTV has also been described in apparently healthy humans, tupaias, tamarins, douroucoulis, swine, dogs, and cats. the GenBank accession numbers for the anelloviruses in Fig. 1 are NC_014071, NC_012126, NC_014087, EF538877, NC_002076, NC_014076, NC_014091, AB060597, AB038621, NC_014083, AB041958, NC_014480, AB041957, NC_014077, NC_014085, AB0573"}
