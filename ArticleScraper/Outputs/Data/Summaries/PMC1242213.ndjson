{"summary": "metagenomics uses DNA sequence data to study unculturable microorganisms found in the natural environment. bioremediation progress may be very large, especially in case of environmental samples. bioremediation progress may be very large, especially in case of environmental samples. nucleic acid extracted from clinical specimens usually contains host and bacterial contaminants in addition to viral RNA and DNA. hybridization patterns are complicated by substantial amounts of noise introduced by specific cross-hybridization that cannot be anticipated or controlled. a species identification strategy based on experimentally derived patterns alone is not feasible. the resulting hybridization pattern is compared with a set of theoretical hybridization energy profiles computed for every species of interest. observed hybridization intensities are represented by a row vector x, where each intensity value corresponds to an oligonucleotide in x. oligonucleotides that failed to produce a BLAST alignment were assumed to have hybridization energies equal to zero. a given theoretical energy profile consists of the non-zero hybridization energies calculated for the subset of oligonucleotides producing a BLAST alignment to the corresponding genome. each row corresponds to a viral species and each column corresponds to an oligonucleotide from the microarray. syncytial virus (RSV) and seven contained influenza A virus (FluA) were normalized using sum, quadratic, unit-vector, or no normalization (Table 1). Similarity scores between the vectors were computed using dot product, Pearson correlation, uncentered Pearson correlation, Spearman rank correlation, or similarity based on Euclidean distance. DP, dot product; ED, similarity based on Euclidean distance; PC, Pearson correlation; SR, Spearman rank correlation; UP, uncentered Pearson correlation. for each combination of parameters, intrafamily and interfamily separations were calculated as the score of the virus profile matching the virus present in the sample. the best performing combinations are shown in order of increasing performance. we obtained empirical distributions of the scores for every virus profile in the energy matrix. the distributions were based on 1,009 independent microarray experiments. the distributions were based on 1,009 independent microarray experiments. the most closely related intrafamily virus profiles (purple circles) were separated from those of the match viruses by more than 1.1 (HPV45), 2.1 (human metapneumovirus) and 3.4 (influenza B virus) logs. even P values of the most closely related intrafamily virus profiles (purple circles) were separated from those of the match viruses. more distant intrafamily profiles are shown in blue: HPV37, mumps virus (MuV), and influenza C virus (FluC) the inset in each panel shows a normalized histogram (density) of the empirical distribution of log-transformed similarity scores for a match profile and the normal fit representing true negative scores. the microarray data have been submitted to the NCBI GEO database [27] (accession GSE2228)

the SARS CoV. thovirus, cardiovirus, hepatovirus, and parechovirus genera can be divided into two major groups (A and B) only two complete rhinovirus reference genomes are available, one for each group: HRV89 (group A) and HRV14 (group B). human rhinovirus (HRV) serotype discrimination using E-Predict similarity scores. culture samples of 22 distinct HRV serotypes were separately hybridized to the microarray. both microarrays (rows) and virus profiles (columns) were clustered. a vector of oligonucleotide intensities is normalized and compared with every normalized profile in the energy matrix. each element in this vector denotes the similarity between the observed pattern and one of the predicted profiles for a species represented in the energy matrix. profiles associated with statistically significant similarity scores suggest the presence of the corresponding viral species in the sample. similarity scores were obtained by comparing every microarray with every virus profile in the energy matrix. the performance of each combination was then evaluated by calculating the separation between the score obtained for the correct (match) virus profile and the best scoring nonmatch profile from either the same or a different virus family. the best overall separation was determined by calculating the product of the means of the intrafamily and interfamily separations. the best overall separation was determined by calculating the product of the means of the intrafamily and interfamily separations divided by the corresponding standard deviations. the loge-transformed similarity scores were approximately normally distributed. probability associated with any observed similarity score should be interpreted as one-tail P values for the null hypothesis. oligonucleotides belong to match virus profiles. similarity scores can be easily recognized and masked if desired. red circles represent match and black circles nonmatch interfamily profiles. our laboratory is conducting a series of studies focused on human diseases suspected of having viral etiologies. the algorithm was developed to assist in the analysis of samples obtained as part of these investigations. the microarray result was obtained as part of our ongoing study of viral agents associated with acute hepatitis. is B virus Hepadnaviridae 0.123794 0.003111* 35269 Woodchuck hepatitis

respiratory tract infections. a microarray was designed to identify a novel coronavirus during the 2003 outbreak of SARS. it did not contain oligonucleotides derived from the SARS CoV genome. however, after the entire genome sequence of the virus became available, its theoretical energy profile was added to the E-Predict energy matrix. * 107033 Avian nephritis virus Astroviridae 0.057325 0.000020*

E-Predict in which oligonucleotide intensities corresponding to the top scoring profile are set to zero before running the next iteration. only those predictions that are based on alternative oligonucleotides remain. RNA samples from cultures of 22 representative serotypes were individually hybridized to the microarray. the results were analyzed by E-Predict. both microarrays (rows) and virus profiles were included in the clustering. nucleotide sequences of VP1 capsid protein from the 22 HRV serotypes were aligned using ClustalX. the microarray result was obtained as part of our ongoing study of viral agents associated with acute hepatitis. e 0.123794 0.003111* 35269 Woodchuck hepatitis B virus Hepadnaviridae 0.098908 0.003555* 10406 Ground squirrel hepatitis virus Hepadnaviridae 0.093975 0.003475* 10372 Human herpesvirus 7 Herpesviridae 0.027847 0.115068 All virus profiles for which a score could be calculated are shown by similarity score. 9628700_4 Hepatitis B virus Hepadnaviridae 153 104.7 Ten oligonucleotides contributing most to the hepatitis B virus similarity score are shown sorted by their relative contribution. Example 2 In this example, E-Predict assigned highest significance to two unrelated viruses, namely FluA (P 10-6) and RSV (P = 0.008). 7995 virus profiles for which a score could be calculated are shown sorted by similarity score. *Statistically significant probabilities (P 0.01) Example 3 This example illustrates the ability of E-Predict to identify a virus that was not included in the microarray design. the microarray was designed before 2003, but did not contain oligonucleotides derived from the SARS CoV genome. phritis virus Astroviridae 0.057325 0.000020* 47001 Equine rhinitis B virus Picornaviridae 0.044928 0.002118* 11852 Simian type D virus 1 Retroviridae 0.034479 0.016202 31631 Human coronavirus OC43 Coronaviridae 0.029834 0.002178 Iteration 2 11852 Simian type D virus 1 Retroviridae 0. ides corresponding to a conserved 3'-untranslated region shared by these viruses with the SARS CoV are set to zero before running the next iteration. misleading predictions resulting from oligonucleotides shared with the top scoring profile fail to attain significant similarity scores. only those predictions that are based on alternative oligonucleotides remain. human rhinovirus (HRV) serotype discrimination using E-Predict similarity scores. cultures of 22 representative serotypes were individually hybridized to the microarray. the results were analyzed by E-Predict. nucleotide sequences of VP1 capsid protein from the 22 HRV serotypes were aligned using ClustalX. identifying individual species present in a complex environmental or clinical sample is an essential component of many current and proposed metagenomic applications. bioinformatics tools for interpreting hybridization patterns associated with complex clinical and environmental samples are lacking. the energy profile matrix currently represents over 1,200 distinct viruses. oligonucleotides derived from its genome were present on the microarray. oligonucleotides derived from its genome were present on the microarray. a set of normalization and similarity metric parameters was the optimal choice for our data. the combination of sum normalization of the intensity vectors, quadratic normalization of the energy vectors and uncentered Pearson correlation was the optimal choice for our data. however, a different set of parameters may be required for applications that use a different nucleic acid amplification or detection strategy. a procedure similar to that used to generate null distributions for the virus profile scores can be obtained for individual oligonucleotide intensities. such weighting may allow a more accurate assessment of significance. however, no attempt was made to normalize nucleic acid abundances of individual species. this may vary widely in different samples depending on factors such as target-to-background ratio and number of species present. if mink astrovirus were the top prediction in the first iteration, SARS CoV would be the top prediction in the second iteration (P = 2 10-6; data not shown) however, even if mink astrovirus were the top prediction in the first iteration, SARS CoV would be the top prediction in the second iteration. the cells were harvested by adding 10 ml Trizol reagent. a quantity of HeLa total RNA (50 ng) was used for each amplification and hybridization. frozen nasopharyngeal aspirate samples were thawed. oligonucleotides representing the most conserved viral genomic elements were selected as 70-mers having sequence similarity to the highest number of viral genomes. oligonucleotides were resuspended in 3 SSC (0.45 M sodium chloride, 0.045 M sodium citrate, pH 7.0) at 50 mol/l concentration and spotted onto poly-lysine coated glass slides. RNA extracted from the samples was amplified using a modified round A-B random PCR method. random-primed reverse transcription and second strand synthesis were carried out using primer A (5'-GTT TCC CAG TCA CGA TCN NNN NN-3') the amplified material was then labeled with Cy5, and 0.1-1.0 pmol Probe70 (an oligonucleotide complementary to Spike70) training dataset Fifteen HeLa microarrays were chosen randomly from a set of 43 HeLa hybridizations having at least five papillomavirus oligonucleotides. ten RSV microarrays were chosen randomly from a set of 22 clinical hybridizations having at least five paramyxovirus oligonucleotides. the eighth FluA microarray was excluded because it was also positive for RSV by visual inspection. list included 129 oligonucleotides with unnormalized median intensity greater than 500. list also included 137 oligonucleotides obtained by clustering of distributions of sum-normalized intensity. a profile was considered only if it had at least three oligonucleotides. only a small number of profiles (34) required trimming beyond 10%. resulting trimmed distributions were assumed to be normal. only profiles with at least three oligonucleotides with raw intensity greater than 100 (about two to four times background) were considered. patitis sample was confirmed using primers Hep_1F (5'-GAC TGG TGG ACT TCT CTC AA-3') and Hep_4R (5'-GAA AGC CCT GCG AAC CAC TGA A-3') with amplified cDNA (Round A material; see [19] for amplification details) as the template. amplified PCR fragments were sequenced and had at least 99% nucleotide identity to d and 200 l aliquots were used to extract RNA using RNeasy Mini Kit. RNA was eluted from the columns with 30 l nuclease-free water. a 150 l aliquot was used to extract total nucleic acid. RNA was resuspended in 30 l nuclease-free water, and 9 l was used for amplification and hybridization. oligonucleotides representing the most conserved viral genomic elements were selected as 70-mers. each spot on the microarray also contained a unique 'alien' sequence 70-mer. 0.1-1.0 pmol Probe70 was labeled with Cy5 and 0.1-1.0 pmol Probe70. microarrays were pooled and hybridized to the microarray in 3 SSC at 65\u00b0C overnight. seven fluA microarrays were chosen from eight available clinical hybridizations. oligonucleotides with sum-normalized intensities greater than or equal to 0.005 confirmed to be fluA-positive by DFA. eighth fluA microarray excluded because it was also positive for RSV by visual inspection. a profile was considered only if it had at least three oligonucleotides with non-zero energy predictions. the resulting intensity and energy vectors were normalized using appropriate normalization methods. similarity scores were computed using a set of 1,009 hybridizations. iterative E-Predict The first iteration was carried out as described above. for each additional iteration, oligonucleotide intensities of the profile attaining the highest similarity score were set to zero. similarity scores and P values were calculated using the same normalization method, similarity metric, and null distributions as in the initial iteration. a text file of E-Predict output for the hepatitis example (example 1) (Additional data file 1); a text file of E-Predict output for the fluA/RSV double infection example (example 2) (Additional data file 3); a tab delimited text file containing the energy profile matrix (Additional data file 5); a tab delimited text file containing the list of nonspecific oligonucleotides ignored during E-Predict the hepatitis sample was graciously provided as part of an ongoing study by Dr Tim Davern (UCSF). pediatric respiratory samples were graciously provided as part of an ongoing study by Dr David Schnurr and Dr Shigeo Yagi (California Viral and Rickettsial Disease Laboratory, Richmond, CA, USA). from the Sandler Program for Asthma Research and Doris Duke Charitable Foundation (J.D."}
