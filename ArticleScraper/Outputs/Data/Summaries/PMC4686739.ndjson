{"summary": "the mechanism of demyelination in MS is unknown, but may involve a T cell response triggered by virus infection. a mouse model uses MHV-induced demyelination that mimics the pathology of MS. RSA59 produces demyelination that is best observed in the spinal cord. RSMHV2 does not produce demyelination and only rarely demonstrates axonopathic changes in spinal cord white matter. the inability of RSMHV2 to induce demyelination is due in part to lack of transport of viral antigen. RSA59 or its parental demyelinating strain MHV-A59 can infect oligodendrocytes in vitro, isolated from either rat or mouse, or in oligodendrocyte cell lines. inability of RSMHV2 to induce demyelination has not been resolved. failure of RSMHV2 to effect demyelination may be related to impaired axonal transport. recombinant strains express enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) mice were inoculated intracranially with 50% LD50 dose of RSA59 strain. mice were anesthesized with ketamine/xylazine, then perfused transcardially with PBS. ml of PBS containing 10% sucrose, followed by 30% sucrose overnight. five mice were sacrificed at day 6 post-infection for viral titer estimation. four quadrants from two separate sections of each spinal cord level examined. we examined 96 quadrants for RSA59 and 120 quadrants for RSMHV2. 96 quadrants for RSA59 and 120 quadrants for RSMHV2 were examined. antibody (Sigma) 1:100 TRITC-goat-anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) 1:100 Synaptophysin Mouse monoclonal 1:50 TRITC-goat-anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Immunoresearch) 1:100 Oligodendrocyte precursor cells Mouse monoclonal anti-A2B5 antibody (Ref 21) Neat Rhodamine goat anti-mouse IgM sections were incubated for 2 h with monoclonal primary antibodies anti-TAU, anti-MAP (2A + B), anti-Neurofilament (NFM) and anti-Synaptophysin (Syn) to label the axonal microtubules, dendritic microtubules, axonal Neurofilament and synaptic terminals. images were acquired using an Olympus IX81 fluorescence microscope enzyme digested dissociated cells were triturated with 0.25% fetal bovine serum (FBS), followed by a wash and centrifugation (300 g for 10 min) cells were plated and allowed to adhere for 1 day in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. after 24 h cells were removed with HBBS without Ca and Mg. oligodendrocytes and Type-II astrocytes separated were plated to determine viability and ability to grow in culture. in culture, they both grew well and exhibited the expected morphology. Purity of the culture was established using double label immunofluorescence with anti-GFAP and anti-A2B5 antibodies (markers for OPCs) and counterstaining with DAPI to detect cross contamination of GFAP-positive cells. cells were washed and placed in fresh specified media without virus. at 24 h after infection, cultures were immunolabeled with either anti A2B5 or anti-GalC. a similar strategy was used to quantify strain specific infection of PLP positive oligodendrocytes. RSA59 and RSMHV2 are isogenic except for the spike gene. the spike gene encodes an envelope glycoprotein that mediates many biological properties of MHV. these recombinant strains also express enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) mice were anesthesized with ketamine/xylazine, perfused transcardially with PBS, followed by cold PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. spinal cord and brain tissues were removed and placed at 4\u00b0C for 4 h in 10% sucrose, followed by 30% sucrose overnight. five mice were sacrificed at day 6 post-infection for viral titer estimation. rabbit sera, and sections from mock-infected mice were incubated with secondary antibodies only. sections were sequentially washed with PBS plus Triton X-100 and with PBS. all together we examined 96 quadrants for RSA59 and 120 quadrants for RSMHV2. sections were specially post-fixed with ice-cold 95% ETOH at 20\u00b0C for 20 min. sections were then washed with 1X blocking buffer (10 mg/ml Component D) for 15 min. sections were incubated for 2 h with monoclonal primary antibodies anti-TAU, anti-MAP (2A + B), anti-Neurofilament (NFM) and anti-Synaptophysin (Syn) to label the axonal microtubules, dendritic microtubules, axonal neurofilament and synaptic terminals. images were acquired using image ProPlus software with a 40X objective and Hamam cells were plated and allowed to adhere for 1 day in a humidified CO2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. after 24 h, any non-adherent cells were removed with HBBS without Ca and Mg. dislodged oligodendrocytes were plated onto poly-D-Lysine coated coverslips and maintained in serum free growth medium until the culture reached 80% confluence. oligodendrocytes and Type-II astrocytes separated as described above were plated to determine viability and ability to grow in culture. s and differentiated oligodendrocyte cultures were infected at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 with RSA59 and RSMHV2 or mock infected with non-infected cell lysate. at 24 h after infection, cultures were immunolabeled with either anti A2B5 or anti-GalC. four-week-old, MHV-free, C57BL/6 (B6) mice were inoculated intracranially with either RSA59 or RSMHV2 (NDM) strains. MHV replication reaches peak at day 5 and inflammation reaches peak at day 7 post-infection. viral antigen from the RSMHV2 strain is localized to the spinal cord gray matter. double fluorescence/immunofluorescence staining of gray matter does not show EGFP fluorescence surrounded by EGFP cytoplasmic green fluorescence. no co-localization or Olig2 positive nuclei surrounded by EGFP positive cytoplasm was observed in the gray matter (F) EGFP fluorescence (green; A) indicating viral infection is restricted to spinal cord gray matter. Olig2 labeling (red; B) is present in both gray and white matter at day 6 p.i. higher magnification images demonstrate a lack of co-localization of EGFP and Olig2 (D\u2013F) double label immunofluorescence with A2B5 (for OPCs) and GFAP (for astroctyes) or GalC (differentiated matured oligodendrocytes) confirmed that 60\u201370% of the cells either in oligodendrocyte precursor cultures or oligodendrocyte differentiated cultures were positive for A2B5 or GalC. in both precursor cells and differentiated oligodendrocytes, RSA59 forms sy cultures enriched for oligodendrocyte precursors or OPCs stain positive for TYPE-II astrocytes (B) or RSMHV2 (G\u2013I) at a MOI of 1. syncytia is characteristic of infection by the demyelinating MHV strain. in RSMHV2 infected cultures, most cells were not oligodendrocytes. EGFP expression in RSA59 or RSMHV2 does not co-localize with astrocytes in the spinal cord. labeling with anti-GFAP (red; B,E) identifies astrocytes in RSA59 or RSMHV2 infected mice. EGFP fluorescence (green) identifies virus infected cells (A,D,G) anti-PLP labeling (red) was used to detect PLP in the myelin sheath (B,E,H) no co-localization of PLP and EGFP is observed in spinal cord sections from RSMHV2-infected mice (I) in the white matter of the spinal cord, there are several examples of neurofilament immunofluorescence colocalizing with EGFP. RSA59 viral antigen positive cells partially colocalized with synaptophysin. RSMHV2 infects less than 2% of oligodendrocytes in white matter and none in gray matter. RSA59 strain infects 45% of PLP positive oligodendrocytes. olig2 positive cells counted in DM and NDM infection 6 days p.i. cultures were infected with DM or NMD strain at a MOI of 1 for 24 h. one hundred OPCs were counted in 10 separate random fields in tissue culture dishes. percentage of EGFP positive DOs was determined. inoculated intracranially with either RSA59 or RSMHV2. MHV replication reaches its peak at day 5 post-infection. at day 7 post-infection, viral antigen is localized to the spinal cord gray matter. lig2 nuclear fluorescence surrounded by EGFP cytoplasmic green fluorescence. these cells represent infected oligodendrocytes. double fluorescence/immunofluorescence staining of gray matter does not show. higher magnification images demonstrate a lack of co-localization of EGFP and Olig2 (D\u2013F) Arrows mark Olig2 positive nuclei in which there is an inhomogeneous distribution of Olig2. RSA59 strain is more efficient in producing widespread infection of gray and white matter. oligodendrocyte precursors were readily infected with RSA59 and RSMHV2. differentiated oligodendrocytes were only infected by RSA59. in both precursor cells and differentiated oligodendrocytes, RSA59 forms syncytia. RSA59 can infect OPCs and form syncytia that is characteristic of infection by the demyelinating MHV strain (D\u2013F) in RSMHV2-infected cultures, several cells were double positive for A2B5 (red) and EGFP (green), however, no syncytia were observed in RSMHV2-infected oligodendrocyte precursors (G\u2013I) arrowheads in (G,H) mark differentiated matured oligodendrocytes. both RSA59 and RSMHV2 are unable to infect astrocytes in vivo. EGFP expression in RSA59 or RSMHV2 infected cells does not co-localize with astrocytes. RSMHV2 can spread to myelin sheath Infection of oligodendrocyte cell bodies does not necessarily assure viral antigen spread into the myelin sheath. we performed double fluorescence/immunofluorescence staining of the dorsal columns using EGFP expression by infected cells and proteolipid protein (PLP). no co-localization of PLP and EGFP is observed in spinal cord sections from RSMHV2-infected mice (I). however, no co-localization of PLP and EGFP is observed in spinal cord sections from RSMHV2-infected mice (I). RSA59 viral antigen positive cells partially colocalized with synaptophysin. cells immunolabeled for Tau (B), Map2 (2a + 2b) (E,H), Neurofilament (K), and synaptophysin (N) shown in red. RSA59 strain infects 45% of PLP positive oligodendrocytes. RSMHV2 infects less than 1% of oligodendrocytes. olig2 positive cells counted and percentage of olig2 positive cells also positive for viral antigen. cultures were infected with DM or NMD strain at a MOI of 1 for 24 h. one hundred DOs were counted in 10 separate random fields in tissue culture dishes. asterisks indicate significant differences (****p 0.001) different doses of the viral strains (RSA59, 20,000 PFU vs. RSMHV2, 100 PFU) do not affect astrocyte infection within the brain. both strains replicate at a similar rate in the brain and spinal cord and viral titers at day 5 and day 7 post-infection are almost the same. RSA59 strain localizes to axons whereas RSMHV2 strain does not. this lack of transport of the RSMHV2 strain to spinal cord white matter may explain its failure to induce demyelination. in the brain, viral infection of oligodendrocytes was identified. a major mechanism of viral spread to spinal cord white matter is through spike-mediated axonal transport. spike glycoprotein must also play a significant role in facilitating direct spread of virus from neurons to oligodendrocytes. the lack of co-localization of viral antigen in specific CNS cell types provides a logical mechanism for MHV infection. GFAP with either strain indicates that the spread of MHV infection in the spinal cord does not involve an indirect route to oligodendrocytes through astrocytes. a similar discrepancy in the colocalization of EGFP in brain vs. spinal cord oligodendrocytes due to different routes of infection. conflict of interest statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
