{"summary": "rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) is a highly contagious disease characterized by acute liver damage and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) the first outbreak of RHD was reported in 1984 in the Jiangsu Province of China (Zhu et al., 2016) this has quickly spread to most parts of the world. the liver is believed to be the main site of RHDV reproduction. systemic hemorrhagic diathesis and DIC can lead to rabbit death. this is most likely consequences of liver cell loss through RHDV-induced apoptosis. studies have indicated that N-acetyl cysteine (San-Miguel et al., 2006), cardiotrophin (Tunon et al., 2011b), and melatonin (Tunon et al., 2011a) can attenuate liver damage and prolong survival in RHDV-infected rabbits. this is likely due to the induction of various anti-apoptotic factors and their inherent anti-apoptotic effects rabbit kidney cells (RK13), human liver cancer cells (HepG2) and human cervical cancer cells (HeLa) were purchased from the American Tissue Culture Collection (ATCC; Manassas, VA, United States) they were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Gibco; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-NSP6, H27N, D44G, C104G, or pcDNA 3.1-6 his vector for 12 h in 6-well culture plates. the cells were then fixed with chilled 95% ethanol for 10 min at 4 C and washed three times with PBS plus Tween-20 (PBST) the plates were analyzed via fluorescence microscopy (Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) cell viability assay An MTT cell proliferation and cytotoxicity assay kit was used to detect any potential effects of NSP6 on cell proliferation according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the cells were then washed with PBS and resuspended in 100 L binding buffer supplemented with 5 L annexin V (10 g/mL) and 5 L propidium iodide (PI) (20 g/mg) for 10 min in the dark. the samples were immediately screened using flow cytometry. Bcl2 and Bax mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) expression. mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. plasmids were cloned into multiple cloning site of pcDNA 3.1-6 His vector. the resultant plasmids were designated pcDNA 3.1-NSP6, H27N, D44G, and C104G. cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1-NSP6, H27N, D44G, C104G, or pcDNA 3.1-6 his vector for 12 h in 6-well culture plates. cells were then fixed with chilled 95% ethanol for 10 min at 4 C and washed three times with PBS plus Tween-20 (PBST) assays were performed 24 and 48 h post transfection (hpt) using the previously described lipofectamine protocol. optical density was determined using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, United States) each experiment was performed in triplicate. caspase-3, -8, and -9 Activity Caspase-3 -8, and -9 activities were measured using colorimetric assay kits (Beyotime) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions, 20 g of protein was incubated for 2 h at 37 C. Bcl2 and Bax mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. mRNA levels were normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase expression. pt was found primarily aggregated in the cytoplasm. no fluorescent signaling was detected in the control. RHDV-NSP6 influenced cell growth and apoptosis. K13 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1-NSP6 (5000 ng) were detected by MTT assay (A) and trypan blue dye exclusion assay (B) at the indicated time points post transfection. results are expressed as scatter diagram and calculated percentage of annexin-V-positive cell population. in annexin V/PI assay, early apoptotic cells and late apoptotic cells were detected. however, only adherent cells were detected in pcDNA3.1-NSP6-transfected RK13 cells. the apoptotic rate indicated by TUNEL assays was only 4%. pcDNA3.1-NSP6 promotes Activation of Caspase-3, -8, and -9 Caspases are cysteine proteases that play fundamental roles in the apoptotic responses of cells to different stimuli. caspase-3 activity was first observed in NSP6-transfected cells at 12 hpt and upregulated 1.6-fold at 48 hpt. caspase-3, (B) caspase-8, and (C) caspase-9 were measured at the indicated time points post transfection using a caspase-3/8/9 assay kit. results are from one representative of three independent experiments. his27 is a 3C-like serine protease that contains a canonical catalytic triad of His27, Asp44, and Cys104. three single-point mutants, His27Asn (H27N), Asp44Gly (D44Gly) and Cys104Gly (C104G) were generated in the wild-type NSP6 protein. nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) analysis of apoptosis in RK13 cells induced by NSP6 and mutants. expression of NSP6 in transfected rabbit kidney cells was determined using a His-NSP6 fusion protein and immunofluorescent staining. cells to 63 and 46% of control cell at 24 and 48 hpt. the viable cell rate of RK13 cells transfected with NSP6 reduced to 72, 66 and 65% at 24, 48 and 72 hpt. the reason for the difference may be the different experimental principles. pcDNA3.1-NSP6 transfected RK13 cells with either empty pcDNA3.1-6 His or pcDNA3.1-NSP6 plasmids. we transfected apoptosis 24 h after transfection with pcDNA3.1-NSP6 plasmids. the percentage of apoptotic cells was markedly increased to 75%. apoptotic rate indicated by TUNEL assays was only 4%. similar results were obtained in human HeLa and HepG2 cells. the effect was not limited to RK13 cells. caspase-8 and caspase-9 activities were also increased in NSP6-transfected cells. maximal increases were observed at 48 hpt. this is consistent with the increase in apoptotic cells observed in pcDNA3.1-NSP6-transfected cells using annexin V/PI flow cytometry. the expression of Bcl2 was significantly higher in NSP6-transfected cells at 24 and 36 hpt when compared with vector control. the level of Bax to Bcl2 mRNA and Bax/Bcl2 ratio largely changed in RK13 cells. apoptosis rates induced by each mutant were analyzed using annexin V/PI staining of RK13 cells. the level of apoptosis induced by each mutant was significantly lower than that of wild-type NSP6. the role of 3C-like protease induced apoptosis has also been characterized in severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (Lin et al., 2006). however, whether RHDV-NSP6 with similar structure can induce apoptosis has not been reported. pcDNA3.1-His vector was found primarily aggregated in the cytoplasm of RK13 cells detected by immunofluorescence assay. this is slightly different with the results from Urakova et al. (2015). lower right quadrant and AnnexinV+/PI+ cells confirmed induction of apoptosis by pcDNA3.1-NSP6 in RK13 cells. in addition, NSP6 induced apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner in RK13 cells. this was replicated in human HeLa and HepG2 cells (Figure 3B,C), indicating that the effect is not limited to RK13 cells. apoptosis in RK13 cells via the death receptor-mediated and mitochondrial apoptotic pathways. however, the activation of the initiator caspase-8 can also be related to the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway via cleavage of Bid. further investigations are necessary to clarify the detailed mechanisms of NSP6-induced apoptosis. asn and Gly were chosen as residue substitutions. they do not have similar structural functions to wild-type residues. mutation of the 3C-like protease active site impaired apoptosis. mutating sites involved in protease activity impairs apoptosis. all authors read and approved the final manuscript. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
