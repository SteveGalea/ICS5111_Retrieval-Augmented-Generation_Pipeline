{"summary": "the nutritional value of kimchi is considered high because kimchi is rich in dietary fiber, vitamins, and minerals. kimchi became a worldwide food due to its functional properties. antiviral effects of kimchi, particularly against severe acute respiratory syndrome, had drawn considerable attention. dized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) is involved in cholesterol accumulation in macrophages by internalizing them into the cells through binding with scavenger receptors on the membrane. scavenger receptors recognize modified LDL and bind with it, leading to the cellular accumulation of cholesterol in macrophages. the control of CD36 expression is strongly associated with the etiology of atherosclerosis. recently, synthetic compounds such as PPAR agonists and LXR agonists have been shown to delay atherosclerosis by stimulating reverse cholesterol transport from macrophages. antibodies for PPAR, CD36, PPAR, LXR, ABCA1 and -actin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and mouse Ig were purchased from SantaCruz Biotechnology. Enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) advanced detection kits were purchased from Pierce Biotechnology, Inc. monocyte line THP-1 cells were grown in the RPMI 1640 medium. they were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS, 20 IU/mL penicillin and 20 g/mL streptomycin. cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1105 cells/well. two hundred microliters of each medium supernatant was mixed with a 400 L TBARS solution and then boiled at 95\u00b0C for 30 min. TBARS values were expressed as equivalent nmoles of MDA. e-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:5000 dilution) for 1 h at RT. the membrane was washed and the antigen signal was detected by ECL. band intensities were quantified by ImageJ Software (NIH) and normalized to the internal control -actin. antibodies for PPAR, CD36, PPAR, LXR, ABCA1 and -actin and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit and mouse Ig were purchased from SantaCruz Biotechnology. preparation of KME and HDMPPA Fermented Korean cabbage kimchi (pH 4.2) was freeze-dried. oxLDL was determined as thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) and expressed as malondialdehyde (MDA) equivalents. cells were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 1105 cells/well in the RPMI 1640 medium. oxidation measured by using a TBARS assay. two hundred microliters of each medium supernatant was mixed with a 400 L TBARS solution. TBARS values were expressed as equivalent nmoles of MDA. the membrane was incubated with a species-specific horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG at 1:5000 dilution) the membrane was washed and the antigen signal was detected by ECL. band intensities were quantified by ImageJ Software (NIH) and normalized to the internal control -actin. THP-1 cells were incubated with different concentrations of KME (100, 250, and 500 g/mL) or HDMPPA (10, 25, and 50 g/mL) for 24 h followed by the addition of oxLDL (100 g/mL) for 48 h. cell viability was significantly reduced because of LDL-C oxidation. KME and HDMPPA partially attenuated cholesterol influx by downregulating CD36 expression. expression of atherosclerosis-related proteins such as CD36, PPAR, PPAR, PPAR, LXR, and ABCA1 were examined by Western blot. THP-1-derived macrophages were incubated with or without KME or HDMPPA for 24 h followed by the addition of oxLDL (100 g/mL) for 48 h. western blot was performed by densitometric analysis. color images available online at www.liebertpub.com/jmf KME and HDMPPA improved the cell viability of THP-1 cells by delaying LDL oxidation. cell viability was significantly reduced because of LDL-C oxidation as the peroxidized lipid accumulation in the cell medium increased. MPPA (10, 25, and 50 g/mL) for 24 h followed by addition of oxLDL. data are expressed as meanSD (n=3 in triplicates, P.05). a\u2013dIndicates significant difference. western blot analysis of PPAR, CD36, PPAR, LXR, and ABCA1 protein expression. lipid accumulation in THP-1-derived macrophages was evidently suppressed in presence of KME and HDMPPA. oxLDL upregulates CD36 expression, leading to the formation of foam cells. PPAR is an important transcription factor with crucial regulatory roles in adipogenesis and lipid metabolism. PPAR regulates lipid homeostasis by stimulating the peroxisomal -oxidation of fatty acids. PPAR also shortens long-chain fatty acids thereby preventing lipid accumulation. efflux of cholesterol from human foam cell macrophages to HDL is independent of ABCG1 expression, but specifically requires the expression of ABCA1. oxLDL only reduces ABCA1 expression, suggesting that the ABCA1 pathway is important for transporting cholesterol from human macrophages. PPAR positively controls cholesterol efflux in macrophages by enhancing expression of SR-B1 and ABCA1. PPAR positively controls cholesterol efflux in macrophages by enhancing expression of SR-B1 and ABCA1. author Disclosure Statement The authors declare no conflicts of interest."}
