{"summary": "specialized tissue-resident M can be found in most major organs, including Kupffer cells in the liver, Langer-hans cells in the skin, microglia in the brain, splenic red pulp M, lung alveolar M, adipose tissue M, and bone osteoclasts. populations can be directed to distinct phenotypic programs in a process known as M polarization. the diverse properties of different M subsets can have drastic effects on health and disease within the tissues where they reside. the induction of a particular subset can be protective during homeostasis or disease. the most well-described and commonly reported paradigm of M polarization is the M1/M2 polarization axis. originally named to reflect relationships to Th1/Th2 polarization of immune responses, M1 and M2 M are also referred to as classically or. alternative activation is mediated by IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. alternative activation is mediated by IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13. 2 M in mouse models identified additional signatures of alternative activation. polarization state is characterized by little to no secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. increased secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines, increased scavenging of cellular debris, and increased capacity to fight parasitic infections. chitinase-like proteins YM1 and YM2 are markers of murine M2 polarization which lack human orthologs. chitinase-like proteins YM1 and YM2, along with FIZZ1, are markers of murine M2 polarization which lack human orthologs. chitinase-like proteins YM1 and YM2, along with FIZZ1, are markers of murine M2 several signaling pathways have been implicated in atherosclerosis. one of the major pathways identified is the JAK/STAT pathway. one of the major pathways identified is the JAK/STAT pathway. STAT1/3 and STAT6 regulate transcription of M1 and M2 genes. differential activation of Akt1 or Akt2 via PI3K and PIP3 leads to either M2 or M1 polarization, respecively (B). GM-CSF triggers M1 polarization via IRF5 while M-CSF induces M2 polarization via IRF4 (C) zinc-finger transcriptional regulator Kr\u00fcppel-like factor 4 is involved in this pathway as well. phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway regulates M survival and gene expression via activation of the Akt family of serine/threonine protein kinases. GM-CSF leads to downstream activation of IRF5 (M1) while M-CSF leads to IRF4 (M2) activation. pathogens would evolve strategies to redirect and alter M activation in their favor. pathogenic bacteria have developed mechanisms to interfere with M polarization in order to enhance their own survival. some species accomplish this by blunting M1 polarization. PPAR expression is upregulated in salmonella-infected M. PPAR deficiency severely inhibits bacterial replication and persistence. clade 2.3.4 is the most successful at infecting, replicating and inducing cytopathic effects in human monocyte-derived M (MDMs) clade 2.3.4 stimulated the highest expression of IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF, IFN, and MCP-1 in MDMs. human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) has a more complex relationship with M polarization. the HCMV gene encodes a homolog of human IL-10 that is capable of polarizing monocytes towards an anti-inflammatory M2c phenotype. HCMV optimally infects M2-but not M1-polarized M. viral survival strategy takes advantage of both M1 and M2 M as means to different ends. this can also be inferred from the ability of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines from HCMV-infected M to enhance virus replication and dissemination. type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease that results in high blood sugar following the destruction of insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells via activation of innate immunity. growth hormone also triggers M2 polarization of M via modulation of the cytokine milieu, stimulating the activity of suppressor T cells and limiting Th17 cell activation. obesity is a major health problem in western countries and a risk factor for insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and artherosclerosis. the severity of obesity-related metabolic dysfunctions correlate with M1 ATM infiltration. chronic inflammation in adipose tissue inhibits the production of adiponectin. chronic inflammation in adipose tissue inhibits the production of adiponectin. in homeostatic conditions, Kupffer cells perform immune surveillance by removing pathogens and toxins from the circulation and maintain liver tolerance through IL-10 secretion. in early mouse models of diet-induced steatohepatitis, Kupffer cells are the first innate cells responding to injured hepatocytes. Kupffer cells may contribute to the development of hepatic inflammation by promoting M1-like M polarization. TLRs and scavenger receptors trigger proinflammatory responses. the imbalance of gut flora may influence liver disease by activating TLRs expressed on liver cells and leading to the activation of NLPR3. M2 cytokines IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 are present within the tumor microenvironment. peritumoral M that express M1 cytokines like IFN, IL-1, and IL-6 have been shown to have antitumoral effects. the small secretory lectin Reg3 is an important inhibitor of inflammation in pancreatic and intestinal tissues. deficiency of Reg3 drastically impairs pancreatic tumor growth. M2 TAMs have also been shown to increase fibroblastic morphology, vimentin and snail expression, metalloproteinase activity, and proliferation and migration of pancreatic cancer cells. terial biofilms that form on body surfaces or on surgical implants lead to chronic and recurrent infections. treatment of established biofilms significantly reduced bacterial burden compared to antibiotic treatment. microbes themselves may also prove useful sources of therapeutics that modulate M polarization. apolipoprotein A-I mimetics are a class of therapeutic molecules that attempt to modulate HDL to treat atherosclerosis. anticancer therapies also seek to convert protumoral M2 M into M1 M. type include zoledronic acid, CpG oligonucleotide, and histidine-rich glycoprotein. polarization itself is an extremely nuanced and fine-tuned process. it can produce nearly infinite variations of endpoint phenotypes."}
