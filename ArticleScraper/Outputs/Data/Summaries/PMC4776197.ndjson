{"summary": "rotavirus in epithelial cells of children with gastroenteritis, astrovirus in infantile diarrhea cases, enteric adenoviruses in the feces of children with acute diarrhea. norovirus is also responsible for around 60% of all sporadic diarrhea cases, reviewed in the literature. genogroups of sapovirus described [14] account for 2.2%\u201312.7% of all gastroenteritis cases around the globe. sapovirus outbreaks occur throughout the year and can be foodborne. rotavirus infection is the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis among children. rotavirus is the second most common cause of gastroenteritis in adults. the new: Potential Pathogenic Viruses in the Gastrointestinal Tract In the 1980s and 1990s some viral agents were identified for which the direct association with disease is less clear. the virus has been detected in fecal samples of several animal species, and it has been shown that the viruses are genetically highly diverse without a clear species clustering. the first tissue culture system was developed in 1907 which boosted the discovery of new viruses. in the 1930\u2019s serology and electron microscopy were introduced which boosted the discovery of new viruses. several DNA-based techniques have been developed for virus discovery. the virus needs to be present at a high concentration, while the host background DNA and/or RNA should be minimal and preferably not complex. the virus needs to be present at a high concentration, while the host background DNA and/or RNA should be minimal and preferably not complex. antibodies against astrovirus HMO-C were observed. no antibodies against astrovirus HMO-A were found. clades of astroviruses are genetically far distinct from classical astroviruses. novel members of the Picornaviridae In 2008, Saffold virus was detected in a stool sample from a pediatric patient with fever of unknown origin. cytopathic effects were observed and neutralizing antibodies have been found in serum samples [59], subsequent case-control studies showed that the virus was not significantly associated with diarrhea. in 2008 cosavirus was identified in a substantial amount of individuals without diarrhea. novel members of other Viral Families Bufavirus is a member of the Parvoviridae and was first described in 2012. two cases-controls in Thailand and in turkey showed that the virus was only found in patients with diarrhea and not in controls. however, because of the low prevalence, no significant association with disease was found. novel members of the Picornaviridae In 2008, Saffold virus was detected in a stool sample from a pediatric patient with fever of unknown origin [46] cytopathic effects were observed and neutralizing antibodies have been found in serum samples. a case-control study showed that this virus was also detected in a substantial amount of individuals without diarrhea and is not associated with diarrhea [32,62,63]. MW polyomavirus [67] and STL polyomavirus [70] were not significantly associated with diarrhea in two independent case-control studies. two cases-controls in Thailand and in turkey showed that the virus was only found in patients with diarrhea and not in controls. however, because of the low prevalence (respectively 0.3% in Thailand and 1.4% in Turkey), no significant association with disease was found. the microbe occurs in every case of the disease in question and under circumstances which can account for the pathological changes and clinical course of the disease. the microbe occurs in no other disease as a fortuitous and nonpathogenic parasite. the microbe is the cause of the disease can be considered. the virome capture sequencing platform for vertebrate viruses (VirCapSeq-VERT) uses 2 million probes which cover the genomes of all members of the viral taxa known to infect vertebrates. the most straightforward method to demonstrate association with disease is using case-control studies. the most straightforward method to demonstrate association with disease is using case-control studies. the long list of viruses identified in the gastrointestinal tract is not final yet. it is to be expected that several novel viruses will be described in the near future."}
