XRN1 stalls on a knot-like three-helix junction motif located in the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of many if not all arthropod-borne flaviviruses (15, 16) XRN1 stalls on internal ribosome entry site-associated structures in the 5\u2032 UTR of the non-insect-associated hepaci- and pestiviruses of the Flaviviridae (17) reconstituted XRN1 biochemical assays to search for regions from additional RNA viruses capable of stalling and repressing XRN1. the 3\u2032 UTR from the nucleocapsid-encoding S segment of Rift Valley fever virus, as well as the 3\u2032 UTRs from all four mRNAs of Junn virus, an arenavirus, contained RNA segments that stalled and repressed XRN1. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 designations refer to the ends of the genomic or antigenomic RNAs. the circles at the 5\u2032 ends of the mRNA represent host cell-derived cap structures. the location of the small RNA fragments used in C are indicated by the lines under the capped mRNAs. tested contain the 3\u2032 UTR from either the snake arenavirus SN-68 L or SN-90 Z mRNAs. all data shown in B and C are representative of three independent experiments. a radiolabeled reporter RNA was incubated with recombinant XRN1 for the times indicated. products were resolved on a 5% acrylamide gel containing urea and visualized by phosphorimaging. results 3\u2032-Terminal region of the N mRNA of Rift Valley fever virus stalls XRN1 A knot-like structure in the 3\u2032 UTR of arthropod-borne flaviviruses stalls the cellular 5\u2032-to-3\u2032-exoribonuclease XRN1 (15, 16, 21) RVFV contains a tripartite genome with the smallest S segment encoding mRNAs from its genome and antigenome segments in an ambisense gene expression strategy. to determine whether any of the mRNAs encoded by RVFV possessed structures that could stall XRN1, we focused on the distal end of the transcript, including the 3\u2032 UTR region. an RNA structure in the 3\u2032-terminal region of the RVFV N mRNA is capable of stalling both human and recombinant K. lactis XRN1 in the absence of RNA-binding proteins. RVFV is transmitted to mammalian hosts via a mosquito vector (24). previous studies have shown strong 5\u2032-to-3\u2032-exoribonuclease activity. a decay intermediate is observed for the reporter construct carrying the RVFV N 3\u2032 UTR but not for the GFP control. a 206-base fragment from the 3\u2032-terminal region of the N mRNA of RVFV possesses the ability to stall the highly processive cellular 5\u2032-to-3\u2032-exonuclease XRN1. total RNA was isolated 48 h post-transfection, separated on a 5% acrylamide-urea gel, blotted, and probed using a radiolabeled RNA. results were visualized by phosphorimaging. ability of the 3\u2032-terminal portion of the N mRNA to stall XRN1 is conserved among other phleboviruses. a 168-base control RNA derived from pGEM4 (control lanes) or a pGEM4-derived RNA containing 3\u2032-terminal fragment of the Sandfly Naples N mRNA. deNV 3\u2032 UTR, RVFV N 3\u2032-terminal region-containing cold competitor RNAs were generated and incubated along with a radiolabeled reporter RNA and recombinant XRN1. RNA reaction products were analyzed on an acrylamide gel at various time points post-XRN1 incubation to assess relative exonuclease activity in the presence of each competitor RNA. acrylamide gel containing urea and visualized by phosphorimaging. gels from three independent experiments were quantified. asterisk represents a p value of 0.001 at both time points. incubation of the RVFV N 3\u2032-terminal region-containing RNA with XRN1 diminished. but did not completely abrogate the ability of the RNA structure to stall XRN1 compared with when the RNA is incubated in the presence of KCl. the RVFV 3\u2032-terminal fragment was reverse-transcribed, and nine were sequenced. the larger arrows indicate two clones out of the nine sequenced indicated that Xrn1 stalled at that site. the underlined nucleotide is the approximate stall site indicated by sizing of decay intermediates on acrylamide gels. arenaviruses have a bipartite genome and use an ambisense approach to generate mRNAs from both segments. to determine whether the 3\u2032 UTRs of these mRNAs could stall XRN1, we inserted these non-coding segments into a reporter construct, generated RNA substrates with 5\u2032-monophosphate ends, and incubated them with recombinant XRN1. a conserved viral RNA structure is found in 3\u2032-untranslated regions. it has previously been shown to be required for efficient viral gene expression. the RNA containing the conserved 3\u2032 UTR was effectively degraded by recombinant XRN1 enzyme similar to the control RNA with no detectable intermediates. this suggests alternative strategies for this family of viruses to evade the cellular RNA decay machinery. XRN1 exoribonuclease is rapidly degraded by XRN1 with no apparent decay intermediates in a reconstituted reaction using purified components. multiple decay intermediates are formed because XRN1 can occasionally degrade through the first upstream knot-like three-helix junction that it encounters. XRN1 then reaches a second knot-like structure just downstream of the first (22), resulting in the smaller decay intermediate seen on the gel. structural elements located in the 3\u2032 UTR downstream of the stop codon would not interfere with ribosome translocation during protein synthesis. the three-helix junction structure of the arthropod-borne flaviviruses is located in the 3\u2032 UTR (22) therefore, we cloned a 206-base fragment representing the 3\u2032 end of the open reading frame along with the 3\u2032 UTR of the four RVFV mRNAs into a reporter construct, generated radiolabeled previous studies have shown strong 5\u2032-to-3\u2032-exoribonuclease activity in cytoplasmic extracts of cultured mosquito cells (18, 25) clear RNA decay intermediates accumulated, indicating stalling of XRN1. this is reminiscent of multiple XRN1-stalling sites previously observed in flavivirus UTRs (17, 18, 23) a 168-base control RNA derived from pGEM4 or a pGEMA60-derived RNA containing 3\u2032-terminal fragment of the RVFV N mRNA (RVFV-N lanes) were incubated with C6/36 mosquito cell cytoplasmic extract for the times indicated. XRN1 degradation assays were performed using either recombinant (rXRN1) or extracts derived from C6/36 or HeLa ability of the 3\u2032-terminal portion of the N mRNA to stall XRN1 is conserved among other phleboviruses. ability of the 3\u2032-terminal portion of the N mRNA to stall XRN1 is conserved among other phleboviruses. a 168-base control RNA derived from pGEM4 (control lanes) or a pGEM4-derived RNA containing 3\u2032-terminal fragment of the Sandfly Naples N mRNA (Sandfly Naples lanes) or Heartland virus (Heartland lanes) were incubated with C6/36 mosquito cell cytoplasmic extract (top panel) or recombinant XRN1 (bottom panel) for the times indicated 1,800 fmol of competitor RNA was used to repress 266 fmol of recombinant XRN1. the RVFV N 3\u2032-terminal region, similar to flavivirus 3\u2032 UTRs, can both stall and repress the cellular XRN1 enzyme. vivirus structure that stalls XRN1 is 70 bases long with a three-helix junction at its core (15, 16) the site of XRN1 stalling was approached by purifying the RNA decay intermediate, circularizing it, converting it to cDNA using reverse transcriptase. the multiple G-tracts in this segment are reminiscent of a G quadruplex-based structure (28). XRN1 stalls within a G-rich portion of the RVFV N 3\u2032-terminal fragment. a top 5 g of unlabeled RNA containing the RVFV 3\u2032-terminal segment was incubated with recombinant XRN1 for 15 min. RNA decay intermediates from the top panel were excised, circularized, and reverse-transcribed. radiolabeled reaction products derived from XRN1 acting on the reporter RNA were resolved on a 5% acrylamide gel containing urea and visualized by phosphorimaging. values below the lanes indicate the amount of overall complete RNA degradation observed at the various time points. Junn virus mRNAs stalled XRN1 and formed decay intermediates. mRNAs formed decay intermediates, reminiscent of multiple sfRNAs formed by XRN1 action on flavivirus 3\u2032 UTRs. both 3\u2032 UTR segments from SN-68 and SN-90 boa-derived arenavirus transcripts were capable of stalling XRN1. the RNA containing the conserved 3\u2032 UTR from MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was effectively degraded by recombinant XRN1 enzyme similar to the control RNA with no detectable intermediates. however, we failed to identify any RNA decay intermediates accumulating in total RNA from MERS-CoV-infected cells. this suggests alternative strategies for this family of viruses to evade the cellular RNA decay machinery. XRN1 appears to be an attractive target for stalling and repression by viral RNAs. XRN1 plays a major role in a key pathway of RNA decay. XRN1 has been implicated in mediating cross-talk between transcription rates and decay rates to maintain homeostasis of gene expression in cells. stalling of XRN1 has been associated with flavivirus pathogenesis/cytopathology. disruptions in cellular regulation of mRNA stability associated with XRN1 stalling may also have implications in pathology of arenavirus and phlebovirus infections. XRN1 stalling may lead to the generation and accumulation of small non-coding RNA decay intermediates in phlebovirus- and arenavirus-infected cells. if they accumulate to significant levels in infected cells, these small RNAs, like flavivirus sfRNAs, could play a role in combating the RNAi (46, 47) and/or interferon responses (48, 49) the contribution of G-rich tracts observed in RVFV is reminiscent of poly(G) tracts that have been previously successfully used in yeast system to stall XRN1 (29). poly(G) stretches fail to effectively stall XRN1 in most other eukaryotic systems to date (25). thus, the RVFV G-rich region likely is highly specialized and/or works in conjunction with another structural element to effectively impede XRN1 movement toward the 3\u2032 end of these viral generate RNAs by in vitro transcription were generated by cloning PCR products into pGEM4 or pGEMA60 (9) vectors. PCR products from the 3\u2032-terminal regions of the RVFV L, G, NSs, and N mRNAs, as well as the 3\u2032-terminal regions from the Junn Virus GPC, NP, Z, and L mRNAs. a portion of the eGFP 3\u2032 UTR (1402\u20131520 nucleotides, GenBankTM U55762.1) was subcloned into the EcoRI and HindIII sites of pGEM4 to generate peGFP-UTR. internal radiolabeled, 5\u2032-monophosphorylated RNAs were generated using SP6 polymerase. 85 fmol of each pGEM4 reporter RNA was incubated with a 20-fold molar excess of the pGEM-4 control competitor or the virus-derived deNV, RVFV N, SN90 Z, or JUNV L 3\u2032-terminal fragment RNAs. the average of the percent RNA remaining in each time point from three independent experiments is reported. ing RNA was separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel and stained for 30 min with SYBRTM Gold Nucleic Acid Gel Stain. indicated decay intermediate band was purified from the gel and circularized using T4 RNA ligase. products were then amplified using Pfu Ultra II Fusion HS DNA polymerase (Agilent) a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel was transferred to a nylon membrane. northern blotting was performed using an antisense probe to the eGFP sequence downstream of the RVFV-derived insert. RNA fragments were visualized by phosphorimaging. the depicted image is representative of at least three independent experiments. PCR products were inserted into pGEM4 or pGEMA60 at the PstI and HindIII sites. the RVFV G fragment was inserted into pGEMA60 at the PstI and SphI sites. a portion of the eGFP 3\u2032 UTR was subcloned into the notI site of peGFP-N1 (Clontech) the deNV 3\u2032 UTR plasmid was linearized with EarI. all RNAs were purified on denaturing acrylamide gels prior to use. all RNAs were purified on denaturing acrylamide gels. 5 g of each RNA was incubated with recombinant K. lactis XRN1 for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. followed gel purification to remove excess unincorporated nucleotides. RNA was then separated on a 5% denaturing polyacrylamide gel. cloned into pGEM T-Easy vector for transformation of DH5 cells. peGFP-N1 or peGFP-N1 containing RVFV N 3\u2032 UTR were co-transfected with an shRNA (5\u2032-UACAACAGCCACAACGUCUAU; Sigma SHC005). total cellular RNA was collected at 48 h post-transfection using the Zymo Quick-RNA Miniprep kit."}
