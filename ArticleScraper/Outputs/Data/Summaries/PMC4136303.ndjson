{"summary": "570 to 800 deaths, 56,000 to 71,000 hospitalizations, 400,000 emergency department visits, 1.7 million to 1.9 million outpatient visits, and 19 million to 21 million total illnesses per year in the united states. the genus norovirus is composed of >40 diverse virus strains divided into 6 genogroups (genogroup I [GI] to GVI) the inability of NoV to grow in cell culture has been the major obstacle to developing vaccines against norovirus infection. in vitro expression systems have been evaluated for the production of virus-like particles (VLPs) as vaccines. lentogenic (avirulent), mesogenic (moderately virulent), and velogenic (highly virulent) (12) in NDV, the F protein mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the cell membrane. the protein is synthesized as an inactive processor (F0) that is cleaved by host cell protease into two biologically active subunits, F1 and F2. NDV replicates in the cytoplasm and does not integrate into the host cell DNA. rNDV-VP1 elicited noV-specific humoral, mucosal, and cellular immune responses in mouse models. the chicken embryo fibroblast cell line (DF1) and human epidermoid carcinoma cell line (HEp-2) were grown in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium (DMEM) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) Modified vaccinia virus strain Ankara expressing T7 RNA polymerase was provided by Bernard Moss (NIAID, NIH) the antigenome of strain BC (24) was modified by changing its naturally occurring F protein cleavage site motif (RRQKRF) to that of strain LaSota. modified vector was found to replicate to high titers and to express foreign proteins at high levels but was avirulent in chickens. the ability of rNDV-VP1 to produce VLPs was evaluated by using a procedure described previously (26) for purification of VLPs, the culture medium of DF1 cells at 2 days postinfection (dpi) was collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. allantoic fluid of infected chicken eggs was collected at 3 dpi and centrifuged at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. rNDV-VP1 protein was evaluated in DF1 cells in the presence of 10% chicken egg allantoic fluid. supernatants were collected and replaced with an equal volume of fresh medium at 12-h intervals until 56 hpi. pathogenicity of rNDVs in embryonated chicken eggs and in 1-day-old chicks was determined by the mean death time (MDT) test. mice were immunized individually with a conventional vector (rLaSota-VP1) or modified rNDV-VP1 (30 l each; 106 50% egg infective doses [EID50] by the intranasal route after inhalational anesthesia. all the viruses and VLPs were prepared in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for immunization. a cytokine-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISPOT) assay for detection of gamma interferon (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) was performed. the suspension of spleens was prepared by lysing red blood cells (RBCs) with RBC lysis buffer. the level of noV-specific fecal IgA was calculated from a standard curve. fecal responses were expressed as a ratio of NoV-specific IgA (ng/ml) to total IgA (g/ml). all experiments involving experimental animals were approved by the committee of the IACUC. the construct was designed to conform to the rule of six, which is a requirement for efficient RNA replication. DF1 cells were infected with rNDVs at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1. at 24 h postinfection, cell lysates were collected and analyzed by Western blotting using a monoclonal antibody to VP1. we further analyzed the presence of the VP1 protein in the culture medium and allantoic fluid in SPF chicken eggs. negative stained grids were examined for the presence of VLPs. rNDV-VP1 was cloned into bacmids and transfected into bacmids. pathogenicity of rNDVs in embryonated chicken eggs and in 1-day-old chicks. the mean death time test was determined as mean time (h) for the minimum lethal dose of virus to kill all the inoculated embryos. the ICPI is the mean of the score per bird per observation for clinical symptoms and mortality over the 8-day period. antibody titers in sera were measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. noV-specific IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies were determined by testing individual serum samples against baculovirus VLP antigen-coated plates. splenocytes were stimulated with a synthetic 14-mer peptide to the CD4+ T cell epitope (FYQEAAPAQSDVAL) cells without the peptide and cells stimulated with concanavalin A (10 g/ml) were used as controls. results are expressed as mean numbers of spot-forming cells (SFC) per 106 splenocytes. transcription cassette containing ORF2 of noV was inserted into the antigenomic cDNA of a modified NDV vector. the recovered viruses were passaged five times in embryonated chicken eggs. the correct sequence of the noV insert in each recovered virus was confirmed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) rLaSota-VP1, modified rNDV-VP1, and their parental viruses for 24 h. both rNDV vectors expressed noV VP1 (58 kDa) in DF1 cells. rNDV-VP1 grew to a high titer than did rLaSota-VP1. rNDVs expressing VP1 are highly attenuated in chickens. pathogenicity of rNDVs was evaluated by the MDT assay in embryonated chicken eggs and by the ICPI assay in 1-day-old chicks. pathogenicity tests further confirmed that the two rNDVs expressing the VP1 protein were more attenuated than their parental viruses. virulent strains had an MDT of 60 h, intermediately virulent strains had an MDT of 60 to 90 h and avirulent strains had an MDT of >90 h. pathogenicity of NDV in 1-day-old SPF chicks was evaluated by the ICPI assay. ic fluid samples were collected every 24 h for virus titration and VP1 protein expression. the two rNDV vectors expressing VP1 protein grew to high titers (>108 PFU/ml) in embryonated chicken eggs at 3 dpi. Western blot analysis of rNDV purified from allantoic fluid showed that the VP1 protein was not incorporated into NDV particles. electron microscopy images of norovirus VLPs shown. VLP suspensions (10 l each) were fixed in copper grids, negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate, and visualized by using an electron microscope. induction of noV-specific immune responses in mice. hemagglutination inhibition assay measured noV-specific antibodies in mice. similar levels of serum antibody titers were detected in immunized mice. rLaSota was less efficient for the induction of IgG than modified rNDV and baculovirus-expressed VLPs. the noV-specific IgG1 and IgG1 antibody levels were determined by an ELISA. the baculovirus-expressed VLPs induced significantly higher levels of the IgG1 subtype (titer, 8,320) than did the two rNDVs (P 0.05), resulting in a Th2/Th1 ratio of 4.2. rLaSota-VP1 virus also induced higher levels of IgG2a than of IgG immunization of mice with rLaSota vector and baculovirus-expressed VLPs did not result in efficient induction of a cellular immune response compared to that induced by the modified rNDV vector. cell viability was similar in all groups controlled by concanavalin A stimulation. live-attenuated rNDV vaccines may be more efficient in the stimulation of an IgA immune response than baculovirus-expressed VLPs. noV-specific and total IgA antibodies were determined by an ELISA. the ratio between noV-specific IgA and total IgA was determined by an ELISA. DF1 cells were infected with each virus at an MOI of 1. cell lysates were collected at 24 h postinfection for Western blotting. both rNDV vectors expressed noV VP1 (58 kDa) in DF1 cells. rNDV-VP1 viruses replicated less efficiently than parental viruses. modified rNDV-VP1 grew to a high titer than did rLaSota-VP1 up to 48 h of infection, reaching a maximum titer of 1.9 107 TCID50/ml at 40 hpi. pathogenicity of parental and chimeric viruses in embryonated eggs and in chicks Virus MDT (h) a ICPIb rLaSota 117 0.00 rLaSota-VP1 144 0.00 Modified rNDV-VP1 135 0.00 a Mean embryo death time (h) is the mean time (h) for the minimum lethal dose of virus to kill all of the inoculated embryos. nine-day-old embryonated eggs were inoculated with the rNDV vectors expressing the VP1 protein. allantoic fluid samples were collected every 24 h for virus titration and VP1 protein expression. rNDV purified from allantoic fluid showed that the VP1 protein was not incorporated into NDV particles. for comparison purposes, baculovirus-expressed VLPs were included. all the samples were prepared by CsCl isopycnic gradient purification. VLP suspensions (10 l each) were fixed in copper grids, negatively stained with 1% ammonium molybdate. the sera collected from groups of PBS- and VLP-immunized mice showed negative HI titers to NDV. Mice were inoculated with each virus and VLPs by the intranasal route. noV-specific total IgG (A) and subtypes IgG1 (B) and IgG2a (C) were determined by ELISAs against purified baculovirus-expressed VLPs. the systemic noV-specific IgG response was further characterized into Th1 and Th2 responses by measuring levels of IgG1 and IgG1 respectively. differences in induction of Th1 responses by rNDVs and baculovirus-expressed VLPs were determined using an ELISPOT assay. cells of mice collected from the group immunized with the modified rNDV vector produced the highest levels of IFN- (371 SFC/106), IL-2 (239 SFC/106), and TNF- (610 SFC/106) cell viability was similar in all groups controlled by concanavalin A stimulation. the two rNDV vectors induced an intestinal IgA response in all the mice. modified rNDV-VP1 induced significantly higher levels of IgA response than did rLaSota-VP1 in mice at 5 and 6 wpi. baculovirus-expressed VLPs induced the lowest level of IgA response in mice. in humans, mesogenic strains replicate to higher titers in nonhuman primates. for safety reasons, we altered the cleavage site of the F protein to that of rLaSota in the modified rNDV backbone. the modified rNDV backbone was stable throughout the passage of the virus in vivo. rNDV vector self-assembled into noV VLPs that are morphologically and antigenically similar to native noV virions. the rNDV vector can replicate to high titers and produce large quantities of VLPs in embryonated chicken eggs. the rNDV vector can replicate to high titers and produce large quantities of VLPs in embryonated chicken eggs. we compared the serum, mucosal, and cellular immune responses among mouse groups inoculated with live rNDVs expressing VP1 and baculovirus-expressed VLPs. the intranasal route was chosen for immunization of rNDV vector vaccines, since this is one of the natural routes of NDV infection in chickens. modified rNDV predominantly induced serum IgG2a for a Th1 response. inoculation of VLPs led to IgG1 for a Th2 response. baculovirus-expressed VLPs predominantly induced a Th2 response. a live-NDV-vectored vaccine can effectively induce cellular immunity. intranasal immunization of a VLP vaccine was unable to induce strong mucosal immunity without the use of an adjuvant. in contrast, the induction of strong mucosal immunity by the modified rNDV vector further confirmed a potential use of NDV as a live-attenuated NoV vaccine."}
