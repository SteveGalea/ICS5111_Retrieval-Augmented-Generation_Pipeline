{"summary": "a simple molecular method for rapid detection of ERG11 gene mutations would be an advantage as a screening tool to identify potentially-resistant strains. the method was then used to estimate the frequency of ERG11 mutations and their type in 25 clinical C. albicans isolates with reduced susceptibility to fluconazole and in 23 fluconazole-susceptible isolates. RCA is a simple, robust and rapid (2 h) method for the detection of ERG11 polymorphisms. it showed excellent concordance with ERG11 sequencing. it is applicable to the study of azole resistance in other fungi. more than 60 amino acid substitutions have been described in Erg11p. at least 30 of these have been identified in azole-resistant isolates. the impact of individual substitutions varies, and may differ between azoles. circularisable or padlock probes have been shown to reliably detect SNPs with high specificity. a central linker is flanked by sequences complementary to the 5' and 3' termini of the target sequence. a central linker is flanked by sequences complementary to the 5' and 3' termini of the target sequence. a sensitive RCA-based SNP detection assay was used to detect point mutations in the C. albicans ERG11 gene in eight azole-resistant \"reference\" isolates. the results were compared with those obtained for 23 fluconazole-susceptible strains.

Isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility All but one isolate contained at least one missense mutation when compared with the C. albicans ATCC 28526 sequence (GenBank accession no. AF153844) results obtained by the RCA assay were concordant with DNA sequencing for all isolates. nineteen of the 20 mutations (95%) were clustered in three regions of Erg11p. the most frequently-identified substitutions were E266D (n = 11 isolates) followed by V488I (n = 8), D116E (n = 8) and K128T (n = 7). fluconazole and voriconazole MICs of this isolate were lower than that for isolate 12A. fluconazole-susceptible isolates No ERG11 mutations were detected by either RCA or ERG11 sequencing in five of the 23 (22%) fluconazole-susceptible isolates. the gene from eight of these isolates was previously sequenced. the remaining 25 clinical isolates were interrogated for ERG11 mutations. 48 \"test\" isolates were analysed by RCA and DNA sequencing.

RCA was performed on 10-fold serial dilutions of target template. only signals that were clearly measurable above background were considered indicative of the presence of the mutation. the RCA assay was able to detect ERG11 mutations with high sensitivity in. sensitivity was well above that required to detect heterozygous nucleotide changes. RCA signals indicative of the presence of a specific mutation are shown as exponential increases in fluorescence signal above baseline. RCA results monitored by the RotorGene 6000 real-time PCR machine. accumulation of double-stranded DNA was detected by staining with Sybr Green I. RCA signals indicating the presence of the mutation of interest (labeled as \"positive signal\") are shown as exponential increases in fluorescence. 16 different amino acid substitutions were detected among the 25 test isolates by RCA. 20 substitutions were identified by DNA sequencing. additional amino acid substitutions were due to homozygous nucleotide polymorphisms. nineteen of the 20 mutations (95%) were clustered in three regions of Erg11p: positions 105\u2013165, 266\u2013287 and 405\u2013488 (Table 2). Sequential isolates were available from five patients (patients 3 6, 8, 12 and 16) isolates from patients 3 and 8 had similar ERG11 mutation and MIC profiles. Mutations unique to isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility Fifteen of the 20 Erg11p amino acid substitutions present in C. albicans isolates were not identified in fluconazole-susceptible strains. this included the substitutions G307S, G464S, G448E R467K, S405F and Y132H which have been reported to result in reduced susceptibility to fluconazole. a large number (n = 20) of amino acid substitutions were identified in test isolates with reduced susceptibility/resistance to fluconazole. a single ERG11 mutation profile was found in 14 of 15 fluconazole-resistant isolates in another study [17]. nineteen of the 20 amino acid substitutions, including G450V, present in the test isolates were clustered into the three \"hot-spot\" regions. these hot spots include residues 105\u2013165 near the N-terminus of the protein, region 266\u2013287 and region 405\u2013488 located towards the C terminus of the protein. mutations in resistant and fluconazole isolates are not functionally related to resistance. the finding supports the contention that loss of heterozygosity in a diploid species is a step in the development of the azole-resistant phenotype. methods that detect polymorphisms are well-placed to screen large numbers of isolates from different sources for mutations and to guide functional testing of these isolates for resistance. results using conventional real time PCR are well-known to be highly-dependent on the physical characteristics of the platform. a typical commercial batch of each probe provides sufficient material for up to 5000 assays. the sensitive and specific RCA-based assay proved to be a simple robust method for the rapid detection of ERG11 mutations. it has good potential as a tool for tracking specific strains and identifying markers/co-markers of azole resistance. 33 isolates with reduced fluconazole susceptibility and 23 fluconazole-susceptible isolates were studied. MIC endpoint was lowest concentration of drug resulting in 50% growth inhibition compared with growth in the control well. DNA extraction was performed on a mastercycler gradient thermocycler (Eppendorf AG, North Ryde, Australia) each PCR reaction contained: 1.5 l (12\u201315 ng/l) template DNA, 0.25 l (50 pmol/l) each of forward primer and reverse primer, 1.25 l dNTPs (2.5 mM of each dNTP; [Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany]) a total of 24 padlock probes targeting 24 different ERG11 mutation sites were designed. the probes were 106\u2013123 nucleotides (nt) in length, consisting of two adjacent target complementary sequences with a 48 nt linker region. RCA primer 1 (5' ATGGGCACCGAAGAAGCA 3', Tm 55\u00b0C) and RCA primer 2 (5' CGCGCAGACACGATA 3', Tm 55\u00b0C) were designed to specifically bind the linker region of the probes (Additional file 1) Purification of RCA template Prior to ligation of the probe, ERG11 PCR products were purified. RCA reactions were performed in 50 l volumes containing 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs), 400 M deoxynucleotide triphosphate mix, 10 pmol of each RCA primer, 5% of dimethyl sulfoxide (v/v) and 10 SYBR Green I (Sigma-Aldrich, Castle Hill, Australia) of 46 Australian clinical C. albicans isolates, 25 (obtained from 19 patients) were resistant, or had reduced susceptibility to fluconazole. 21 were fluconazole-susceptible (Table 2). Isolates categorised as susceptible (MIC 8 g/ml), susceptible dose-dependent (S-DD; MIC 16\u201332 g/ml) or resistant (MIC 64 g/ml) to fluconazole. DNA extraction and PCR amplification of the ERG11 gene DNA extraction was performed as described previously. PCR products were purified using the PCR Product Pre-sequencing Kit (USB Corporation, Cleveland, Ohio USA) and sequenced using ERG11-S and ERG11-A primers. a total of 24 padlock probes targeting 24 different ERG11 mutation sites were designed. RCA primer 1 (5' ATGGGCACCGAAGAAGCA 3', Tm 55\u00b0C) and RCA primer 2 (5' CGCGCAGACACGATA 3', Tm 55\u00b0C) were designed to specifically bind the linker region of the probes. a further 25 l of dH2O was added to the well and the process repeated. 0.1 M padlock probe subjected to multiple cycle ligation. one cycle of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 5 min followed by five cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s and 4 min of ligation at 62\u00b0C. exonucleolysis was performed to remove unligated probe and template PCR product.
