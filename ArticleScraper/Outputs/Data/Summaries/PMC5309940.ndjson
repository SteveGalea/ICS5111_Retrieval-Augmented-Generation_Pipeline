{"summary": "MERS-CoV is an emerging zoonotic Betacoronavirus that was initially isolated from a 60-year-old man in September 2012. since then, MERS-CoV is steadily spreading in the Arabian Peninsula. as of April 2016, 1,728 cases of infection have been confirmed. is a polycistronic positive-stranded RNA 30,119 nucleotides (nt) in length. the 3\u2032 part of the genome contains at least nine ORFs that encode structural and virus accessory proteins. the two large ORFs (1a and b) that encode nonstructural proteins (nsp's) are in the 5\u2032 proximal two-thirds of the genome. a guanine N7 methyltransferase (N7-MTase), and a 2\u2032-O-MTase (14) the cap-0 structure ensures efficient mRNA recognition by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) in the cytoplasm, the cap-0 structure (7mGpppN) ensures efficient mRNA recognition by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E nsp13 hydrolyzes the -phosphate from nascent 5\u2032-triphosphate RNA. then, a GMP molecule is transferred to 5\u2032-diphosphate RNA by an as-yet-unknown GTase, thus forming a primitive cap structure. nsp14 methylates the 2\u2032-OH group (ribose) of the first transcribed nucleotide of the viral RNA. recombinant severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nsp16 was inactive using similar experimental conditions. nsp10/nsp16 complex MTase activity was demonstrated using synthetic capped n7-methylated RNA and longer RNAs that mimic the 5\u2032 end of the SARS-CoV genome. nsp10 binding extends and narrows the RNA binding groove to accommodate the RNA substrate and enhances nsp16 RNA- and SAM-binding properties. nsp16 is stimulated by a signaling cascade that stimulates the secretion of type I interferon (IFN) and induces an antiviral response. biochemical assays were used to decipher the fine-tuning of the reaction turnover. nsp10 and nsp16 nsp16 assembles with nsp16 to constitute an active SAM-dependent cap-0 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase. the compounds blocking RNA recognition were identified using a fluorescence polarization assay. nsp10 and nsp16 with an N-terminal His6-tag were produced and purified. their identity was confirmed by mass spectrometry after trypsin digestion. the nsp10/nsp16 complex was obtained by colysis of an equal volume of His6-nsp10 and His6-nsp16 expressing bacteria and purification by immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) nsp16 (1.2 M) and nsp10 (2 M) alone or together and of the nsp10/nsp16 complex (1 M) were determined by monitoring the transfer of 3H-CH3 from SAM to RNA oligonucleotides. assays were stopped after 5, 30, 60, and 180 min, and the radioactivity associated with the RNA was determined by a DEAE-filter binding assay. MTase activity was detected only using 7mGpppGAUUUAA. but not GpppG2\u2032omAUUUAA or 7mGpppG2\u2032omAUUUAA. nsp16 carries the cap 2\u2032-O-MTase activity and is stimulated by nsp10. nsp10/nsp16 complex methylated cap-0 RNAs with sequences corresponding to the 5\u2032 ends of various viruses. results suggest that nsp16 acts as an nsp10-dependent 2\u2032-O-MTase that converts cap-0 into cap-1 RNA structures. absence of 2\u2032-O-MTase activity using GpppRNA suggests that nsp16 can discriminate the cap-0 structure from an unmethylated MTase assays were performed in the presence or not of divalent ions (MgCl2) inhibition of the MTase reaction by EDTA was assessed. the activity was recovered by addition of MgCl2 or MnCl2. the nsp10/nsp16 complex recognizes specifically a cap-0 structure. downstream RNA nucleotides promote loading of cap-0 substrate and their 2\u2032O methylation. nsp10/nsp16 complex was active only on cap-0 RNA. nsp10/nsp16 complex recognizes cap-0 RNA. different short RNA oligonucleotides were labeled with pCp-cy5. nsp10/nsp16 complex was incubated with increasing concentrations of nsp10/nsp16 complex. 7mGpppGAUUUAA-cy5 was incubated with increasing concentrations of nsp10/nsp16 complex in the presence of 100 M SAM or 20 M SAH. the interaction with cy5-labeled RNAs was monitored by fluorescence polarization, and the calculated Kd is indicated at the top of the graph. nsp10, nsp16, and nsp10/nsp16 complex binding to cap-0 RNA. the polarization signal detected after nsp16 binding is higher than that obtained in the presence of the nsp10/nsp16 complex. nsp16 alone binds cap-0 RNA but is not methylated. fluorescence polarization assays were performed using 3\u2032-end-labeled RNA sequences of increasing length that mimicked the 5\u2032 end of the MERS-CoV genome sequence. the MTase activity measured using a filter-binding assay followed the same trend (Fig. 3E). the crystal structure of the nsp10/nsp16 complex with SAH has been reported at 2.0- resolution (30) no structure with a cap analogue or substrate RNA is available yet, the nsp16 residues involved in RNA binding were tentatively inferred by modeling the RNA in the catalytic site. nsp10/nsp16 model was built by alignment of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV nsp16 sequences using the Swiss model and the PyMOL software. nsp16 catalytic residue D130 is depicted in orange, while catalytic and putative RNA binding residues K46, K170, and E203 are depicted in red. nsp16 mutations affect RNA recognition and/or MTase activity. nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity requires interaction with nsp10. nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity requires interaction with nsp10. the nsp16 interaction with biotinylated nsp10 increased in the presence of 100 M SAM or SAH. the interaction kinetics was characterized by the same association rate (same kon) in the presence or in the absence of SAM or SAH. the addition of SAM or SAH increased nsp10/nsp16 complex stability. SAM and SAH modulate nsp10-nsp16 interaction. real-time nsp16 binding to biotinylated nsp10 was measured by Octet biolayer interferometry. nsp16 binding to biotinylated nsp10 was normalized for each trace.

mean the standard error of the mean [SEM] of three independent experiments was deduced by curve fitting using Hill slope equations. nsp10/nsp16 MTase activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of nsp10. 7mGpppGAUUUAA-cy5 was incubated with increasing concentrations of the nsp10/nsp16 complex with or without 1 mM MgCl2. the interaction with the cy5-labeled RNA was followed by fluorescent polarization. nsp10/nsp16 complex recognized only cap-0 RNA (7mGpppRNA) with a Kd of 0.35 M. the ability of this binding site to recognize cap-0 RNA is strongly regulated by the 2\u2032-O-methylation status of the substrate RNA. 7mGpppG2\u2032omRNA, which corresponds to the nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase reaction product, did not bind to the nsp10/nsp16 complex. this indicates that cap-1 RNA generated by the nsp10/nsp16 2\u2032-O-MT the interaction with cy5-labeled RNAs was monitored by fluorescence polarization. the calculated Kd is indicated at the top of the graph. 7mGpppGAUUUAA-cy5 was incubated with increasing concentrations of nsp10/nsp16 complex in the presence of increasing concentrations of nsp10/nsp16. nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity strictly depends on its interaction with nsp10. nsp10 barely interacted with cap-0 RNA (7mGpppRNA) polarization signal detected after nsp16 binding is higher than that obtained in presence of the nsp10/nsp16 complex. the nsp10/nsp16 complex is able to methylate cap-0 RNA of variable RNA sequences. but the MTase activity is weaker using short RNA substrates. fluorescence polarization assays were performed using 3\u2032-end-labeled RNA sequences of increasing length. nsp16 residues played a key role in RNA recognition and MTase activity. no structure with a cap analogue or substrate RNA is available yet. nsp16 residues involved in RNA binding were tentatively inferred. 203, D133, R38, Y47, or Y181 concomitantly reduced MTase activity (80 to 100%) and RNA binding. mutation into alanine of Y30 and Y132, which are within two mobile helices (26-38 and 130-148) also decreased nsp16 RNA binding properties and MTase activity. the residues of the putative RNA binding groove are indicated in cyan (Y181, D133, Y47, and R38) the binding pocket involves the residues N43, D99, F149, F150, and H41 (magenta) the zoom enlargement focuses on the RNA binding groove and the SAM binding domain (ribbon structure) nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity requires interaction with nsp10. nsp10 was biotinylated before immobilization on a streptavidin-coated biosensor. nsp16 interaction with biotinylated nsp16 increased in the presence of 100 M SAM or SAH. the release of SAH will speed up the dissociation of the nsp10/nsp16 complex. nsp10 and nsp16 form a dynamic complex, the association of which is promoted by SAM binding. the complex will dissociate when SAH, the reaction by-product, is released. nsp16 binding to immobilized nsp10 was normalized for each trace. nsp16 binding to immobilized nsp10 was normalized for each trace. nsp16 binding to immobilized nsp10 was normalized for each trace. two SAM analogues (sinefungin and SAH, compounds 2 and 3 in Fig. 7A) also inhibited nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase activity (40 to 45%), whereas GpppG and GpppA (compounds 17 and 15) did not. this suggests that cap analogues block the binding of the RNA substrate in nsp16 RNA or cap binding site. yl]benzenesulfonamide;

SAM/SAH balance in infected cells is a key factor for cap RNA methylation. inhibitors of cellular SAH hydrolases may have an antiviral effect on coV replication. inhibition may have direct effect of an SAH concentration increase on the viral MTase. the viral 2\u2032-O-MTase was highlighted as a potential antiviral target. compounds blocking the viral 2\u2032-O-MTase could limit viral replication in infected animals and elicit a strong antiviral response, favoring viral clearance. pDEST-14/6 His-nsp10 and pDEST-14/6 His-nsp16 containing the coding sequence of the human betacoronavirus 2c EMC/2012 (GenBank accession no. JX869059.2) mutants were generated by single-site amino acid substitution to alanine. transformed bacterial cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani and 2YT media containing 100 g/ml ampicillin and 17 g/ml chloramphenicol. protein expression was induced by the addition of 0.5 mM IPTG (isopropyl--d-thiogalactopyranoside) the nsp10/nsp16 complex was purified on a superdex 200 column 16/60 (GE) equilibrated with buffer W containing 500 mM NaCl (GE KTA purifier) fractions containing the nsp10/nsp16 complex were concentrated by ultrafiltration using 10-kDa Vivaspin 15 (Sartorius) unincorporated 3H-SAM was removed from the DEAE filters by several washes with 0.01 M ammonium formate (pH 8.0), H2O, and absolute ethanol. after drying, filters were incubated with BetaplateScint (Wallac) scintillation fluid before quantification of the 3H methylation of the RNA substrates. 1 mM T4 RNA ligase-1 was removed using Strata-Clean Resin. labeled RNA was collected after centrifugation in a micro-Spin G-25 column. pCp-Cy5-labeled RNA was mixed with increasing concentrations of freshly purified nsp10/nsp16 complex, nsp10, or nsp16 in binding buffer. nsp10 was biotinylated (at room temperature for 30 min) using EZ-Link NHS-PEG4-biotin (Thermo Fisher) at a molar ratio of 1:1 in biotinylation buffer. assays were performed using streptavidin sensors preincubated in 50 mM HEPES. the Kd, Kon, and Koff values were calculated using a 1:1 interaction model. the steady-state curve of nsp10-nsp16 interaction was traced using one site-specific binding with the Hill slope equation. RNAs were chemically synthesized on a solid support using an ABI 394 synthesizer. the following eluents were used: buffer A (20% CH3CN in 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8] and buffer B (20% CH3CN containing 200 mM NaClO4 in 25 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8]) after purification, pure fractions containing the desired RNA were pooled in a 100-ml round-bottomed flask and concentrated to dryness under reduced pressure. the residues mutant numbering starts at the beginning of the nsp16 sequence. mutant numbering starts at the beginning of the nsp16 sequence. all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. nsp10/nsp16 complex was purified on a superdex 200 column 16/60 (GE) equilibrated with buffer W containing 500 mM NaCl (GE KTA purifier) purified enzymes were stored at 20\u00b0C in 50% glycerol. purified nsp10 was added at a final concentration of 2 M in the presence of 1.2 M nsp16. nsp10 was added at a final concentration of 2 M in the presence of 0.7 M synthetic RNA corresponding to the 5\u2032 extremity of the genome. MTase inhibition assays, 0.5 M nsp10/nsp16 complex was mixed with 50 M each candidate inhibitor before addition of SAM (AdoMet; New England BioLabs) and 7mGpppGAUUUAA to start the reaction. reaction mixtures were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 30 min and then analysed by filter binding assay. d RNA was mixed with increasing concentrations of freshly purified nsp10/nsp16 complex, nsp10, or nsp16 in binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8], 1 mM DTT) in a 384-well opaque microplate (Greiner Bio-One) fluorescence polarization was measured using a microplate reader (PHERAstar) with a 590/675 fluorescence polarization biotinylated nsp10 (100 nM) was loaded on streptavidin-coated biosensors for 5,000 s to achieve 0.8-nm binding. nsp16 concentrations (0 to 7.8 M) were used for the association step. pppRNAs and GpppRNAs were purified by ion exchange high-pressure liquid chromatography (IEX-HPLC) and their purity (>95%) confirmed by MALDI-TOF spectrometry. mass spectra were recorded on a Voyager-DE or on an AXIMA Assurance spectrometer. hydroxyacetophenone is a saturated solution in a mixture of acetonitrile and ammonium citrate solution (1:1, vol/vol) for the matrix. the ionization mode was a linear negative ion mode."}
