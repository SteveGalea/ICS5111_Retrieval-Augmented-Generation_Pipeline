{"summary": "seasonal influenza epidemics result in an estimated 250,000\u2013500,000 deaths per year worldwide [1] and in an average of 200,000 hospitalizations [2] and 36,000 deaths per year in the united states alone [3]. yearly immunization has been the most efficient way to prevent influenza so far, but vaccines do not provide complete protection. NK cells secrete large quantities of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines. NK cells secrete large quantities of pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines. NK cells are directly involved in the rapid elimination of virally infected cells. NK cells, and particularly CD56bright NK cells, are consistent with their homing to infected tissues and/or with an increased NK cell death. these studies provide insights into innate immune responses following influenza antigens exposure in humans. however, whether infection with seasonal and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza strains differently affect NK cell expansion and activation. NK cells are defined as lymphocytes that are CD3-negative and can be further subdivided according to their expression of CD56 and/or CD16 into three subpopulations. NK cells are defined as lymphocytes that are CD3-negative and can be further subdivided according to their expression of CD56 and/or CD16 into three subpopulations. populations, namely CD56bright (p = 0.0001), CD56dim (p = 0.007) and CD56neg NK cells (p = 0.004) after an early drop in NK cell numbers one day after vaccination. these data suggest that peripheral blood lymphocytes, including NK cells, home to infected tissues early in acute infection with both seasonal and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza strains. on the other hand, exposure to the inactivated virus through intramuscular NK cells from vaccinated individuals showed highest proportions of activated NK cells. the highest proportions of activated NK cells observed one week following injection of the viral antigens (p = 0.004). dot plots represent percentages of CD25+ CD56bright NK cells from 17 subjects prior to influenza vaccination. at day 1 and 4 post-vaccination, 9 patients with acute seasonal influenza and 21 with acute 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza. NK cells that were exposed to seasonal influenza virus in vivo tended to have a decreased response to the human H1N1 influenza virus in vitro. NK cells that were exposed to seasonal influenza virus in vivo tended to have a decreased response to the human H1N1 influenza virus in vitro. CD56bright NK cells have immunoregulatory properties [38]. plasma levels of a panel of cytokines tended to be lower in patients with seasonal and 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza viruses than in healthy individuals. a significant decrease was only observed for MIP-1 in subjects with pandemic H1N1 influenza infection (p = 0.03) cytokines were very low and stable over time in the plasma of vaccinated subjects. in summary, low levels of cytokines produced by NK cells and significantly increased amounts of anti-inflammatory cytokines were observed in the blood of subjects with acute influenza infection. columns represent mean concentrations of indicated cytokines in 7 controls (black), 9 patients with acute seasonal influenza (dark grey) and 21 with acute 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza (light grey) decreased NK cell numbers reflected a general lymphopenia in the majority of influenza infected subjects. dot plots represent (A), absolute numbers of NK cells (B), percentages of total NK cells and (C), absolute numbers of CD56bright (CD3-CD56+CD16), CD56dim (CD3-CD56+CD16+) and CD56neg (CD3-CD56CD16+) NK cells from 17 subjects prior to influenza vaccination. in the study subjects receiving influenza vaccines, both absolute numbers and percentages of NK cells were significantly higher four days after immunization compared to one day after injection. this observation could be attributed to an overall increase in all NK cells subpopulations, namely CD56bright (p = 0.0001), CD56dim (p = 0.007) and CD56neg NK cells (p = 0.004) after an early drop in NK cell numbers. percentages but not absolute numbers of NK cells expressing CD69 were higher in acutely infected subjects. CD69 expression also increased on NK cells from vaccinated individuals. the highest proportion of activated NK cells observed one week following injection of the viral antigens (p = 0.004) an important drop in CD25+ NK cell counts also occurred in the CD56bright CD25+ NK cell subset in patients with seasonal influenza infection (p = 0.0004) influenza vaccination triggered an initial drop (p = 0.05) followed by an increase in CD56bright CD25+ NK cells in the blood four days following administration of the vaccine (p = 0.0004) peripheral blood NK cells from patients with seasonal influenza showed higher levels of CD107a surface expression in response to 221 and K562 cell lines compared to NK cells from control subjects (p = 0.001) NK cells that were exposed to seasonal influenza virus in vivo tended to have a decreased response to the human H1N1 influenza virus in vitro. infection with 2009 pandemic H1N1 influenza virus leads to fewer activated NK cells in the blood of infected subjects. increased numbers of activated NK cells, and notably CD56bright NK cells, are found in the peripheral blood between 4 to 7 days after intramuscular vaccination. seasonal influenza infection (p = 0.04), while the concentration of IL-15 was slightly higher in acute influenza. acute influenza was also associated with an overall three-fold increase in plasma IFN-2 (not significant) cytokine concentrations were very low and stable over time in the plasma of vaccinated subjects. exposure to influenza antigens was associated with increased percentages of CD69+ NK cells. compared to healthy unvaccinated individuals, acute influenza infection triggered significant variations in cytokine concentrations. increased apoptosis and activation-induced cell death might explain the observed decrease in circulating NK cells. NK cell proportions were not altered in a longitudinal study examining NK cell responses in individuals immunized against influenza. however, frequencies of NK cells were first monitored one week after vaccination, at a time when NK cell numbers also did not significantly differ compared to baseline. NK cells that can efficiently respond to influenza have been recruited to infected tissues. exposure to influenza antigens leads to the downregulation of NKp46. NK cells that can recognize influenza hemagglutinin are not circulating in the periphery. elevated plasma levels of IL-6, IL-12 and IFN- in patients with severe influenza were recently reported. however, timing issues could not explain suppression of cytokines observed in our influenza-infected subjects. s in IL-2 and IL-15 levels are consistent with a key role for these cytokines in the NK cell response to influenza infection. IL-2 is required to enhance IFN- production by NK cells, while IL-15 promotes NK cell proliferation in response to influenza. the impact of IL-10 on the outcome of influenza infection in mouse models is still controversial [58]\u2013[60] fluarix\u00ae 2008\u20132009 formula contains 15 ug purified HA from each of the three seasonal influenza strains. 13 subjects were vaccinated with fluarix\u00ae 2008\u20132009 formula (GlaxoSmithKline, Germany) containing the following inactivated virus strains: A/Brisbane/59/2007 IVR-148 (H1N1), A/Uruguay/716/2007 NYMC X-175C (H3N2) and B/ PBMCs were stained using CD56-A700, CD16-APC-Cy7, CD3-Pac Blue and either CD69-PE-Cy7 or CD25-PE-Cy7.
