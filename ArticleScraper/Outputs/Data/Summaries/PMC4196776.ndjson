{"summary": "quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) is considered the gold standard for accurate measurements of gene expression. qRT-PCR is extremely sensitive necessitating careful selection of an internal control gene with stable transcripts. genes involved in basic cell maintenance processes are expected to maintain stable expression levels among different tissues and conditions. host gene expression showed global down-regulation by 12\u201318 hour post infection (hpi) in bombyx mori nucleopolyhedrovirus-infected B. mori BmN-4 cells. in autographa californica multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV)-infected Spodoptera frugiperda cells, actin, histone, and heat shock 70 mRNAs were greatly reduced between 12 and 18 all infections were carried out at multiplicity of infection (moi) of 10. total RNA extraction A total of 2106 Sf21 cells were infected with wild-type AcMNPV. TC-100 medium was used for the mock infection. the relative transcript levels in the mock-infection sample were considered to be 1 and the relative transcript levels of each of the rest of the samples was calculated accordingly. a Student's t-test was performed on the data. mock-infected cells were collected at 6, 12, 24 and 48 hpi. total RNA was purified by an RNAeasy mini kit (Qiagen) the RNA quality was assessed by Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. sequence myosin myosin F GGATGACGACGGCATCATGATC myosin R GCCTCTACGCCATCACCTTCT 28S q28s F CTGGCTTGATCCAGATGTTCAG q28s R GGATCGATAGGCCGTGCTT Tubulin Tub F. RNA levels of these genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR in two technical replicates. the genes were ordered from the least (higher Ct, to the left) to the most abundantly expressed (lower Ct, to the right) the black line represents the mean of duplicate samples, and the bars indicate the standard deviation of the mean. the highest RNA levels (lowest Cts) for all tested genes were at 6 hpi. a sharp decrease in the transcript levels of tubulin, actin, GAPDH, L35 by 12\u201324 hpi. for the genes with the least variable RNA levels, Ct ranges were between 5.54\u20136.00 and 28.5\u201328.9. 28S rRNA levels fluctuated the least over the course of infection. RNA was extracted from mock-infected Sf21 cells harvested at 12 h.p.i. and from infected cells harvested at 12 h.p.i. each value represents two technical replicates of each of four biological replicates. standard deviation is indicated by bars. 28S gene was used as internal control for normalization and to calculate relative expression based on 2Ct method [19] the highest RNA levels (lowest Cts) for all tested genes were at 6 hpi. myosin maintained a stable, although high, Ct during first 24 hpi. gene Ct values ranged between 33.5 and undetectable (lowest, median, and highest Cts of each gene during 48 hpi) a low average Ct value with low standard deviation (SD) value indicates a higher transcript copy number with a little variation between infection time points. the 28S rRNA levels fluctuated the least over the course of infection. RNA levels were normalized to 28S rRNA (known to be stable during AcMNPV infection) the change in RNA levels was recorded using the 2Ct method. RNA levels were confirmed up to 48 hpi. the 28S had the smallest SD value (0.15) followed by ECD, myosin, actin, GAPDH, tubulin and L35. the ECD RNA levels were higher in infected cells compared to the mock infection at all-time points. 28S and 18S rRNAs were used to normalize qRT-PCR in various studies on virus-infected insect, vertebrate, and plant cells. Previously 28S rRNA was shown to be a promising reference gene to normalize qRT-PCR data in baculovirus-infected cells and for infections by other insect DNA viruses. this makes it difficult to correctly subtract the baseline value in real-time RT-PCR data analysis. -actin is a poor choice as a qRT-PCR reference gene in AcMNPV infected S. frugiperda cells. however, each of these genes may be useful for normalizing qRT-PCR experiments in other situations involving infected insects or insect cells. one of the host genes identified as a potential normalization gene proved to be the most suitable for reference gene for experiments on AcMNPV-infected Sf21 cells. how ECD transcript levels remain stable during AcMNPV-infection, while most host gene transcript levels decline precipitously is unknown. myosin maintained relatively constant transcript levels through 24 hpi before declining by 48 hpi. both 28S rRNA and ECD transcripts remained constant throughout the course of infection, indicating they can serve as reliable normalizers for qRT-PCR analyses in AcMNPV-infected cells through 48 hpi. however, ECD could be a better choice than 28S RNA for comparing transcripts with mid-range numbers during AcMNPV infection."}
