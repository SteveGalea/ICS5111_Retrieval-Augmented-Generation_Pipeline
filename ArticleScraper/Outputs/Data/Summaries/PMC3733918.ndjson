{"summary": "Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a causative agent of acute central nervous system (CNS) disease in humans and domestic animals. 30,000-50,000 cases and 10,000-15,000 deaths are reported annually. more than 50% of survivors may suffer from neurological disability. the laboratory mouse model is commonly employed to study the CNS pathology induced by encephalitic flaviviruses. in common with human cases, mice develop relatively similar neurological dysfunction and the pathologic changes in infected mouse brains are similar to those observed in human cases. the pathologic changes in infected mice are similar to those observed in human cases. microglia are the resident macrophages in the brain and are activated in response to a number of different pathological states. inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6 and TNF- play a significant role in the development of pathology by producing pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and IL-6. IL-10 mediates protection from acute encephalitis and plays a central role in determining the clinical outcome of encephalitic flavivirus infection. insufficient anti-inflammatory cytokine production of IL-4 and IL-10 in the brain is associated with increased tissue pathology. mice infected with JEV exhibiting dose-independent mortality responses. mice were mated in the facility of Nagasaki University. mice were inoculated with a range of 100-106 pfu of JEV diluted in EMEM containing 2% FCS. mice were weighed daily and observed for clinical signs including behavioral symptoms and signs of paralysis. mice exhibiting more than 25% or less than 10% weight loss were recognized as dying or recovering mice. mice inoculated with JEV were anesthetized and perfused with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. fixed tissues were routinely embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. immunohistochemical detection of the JEV antigens was performed as described previously. brains and thymus were removed and placed on ice in RPMI containing 5% FCS (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.) after perfusion with cold PBS, brains and thymus were removed and placed on ice. cells were strained and homogenized gently with a 70 m cell strainer. thymocytes were recognized by their characteristic size and CD4+CD8+ double positive cells were recognized by their characteristic size. Statistical analyses Kruskal-Wallis test, and Mann Whitney test were used to assess the significant differences of viral loads, expression levels of cytokines, and numbers of leukocytes. five to six week old mice were subcutaneously inoculated with a range of 100-106 pfu of JEV diluted in EMEM containing 2% FCS. mice were weighed daily and observed for clinical signs including behavioral symptoms and signs of paralysis. mice exhibiting more than 25% or less than 10% weight loss were recognized as dying or recovering mice. mice inoculated with JEV were anesthetized and perfused with 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. fixed tissues were routinely embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. immunohistochemical detection of the JEV antigens was performed as described previously. after perfusion with cold PBS, brains and thymus were removed and placed on ice in RPMI containing 5% FCS (Nissui Pharmaceutical Co.) the cells were strained and homogenized gently with a 70 m cell strainer (BD Biosciences) after washing, cells were resuspended in RPMI medium. leukocytes were recognized by characteristic size (forward scatter), granularity (side scatter) and CD45 expression. Statistical analyses were used to assess the significant differences of viral loads, expression levels of cytokines, and numbers of leukocytes. IgG antibody seroconversion for more than 1:1000 of IgG ELISA titer. each experiment represents six and four mice infected with JaOArS982 and JaTH160. severe inflammatory reactions were seen in meninges and perivascular area (asterisks) many virus antigen-positive cells were detected in degenerated neuronal cells of the cortex (arrows) viral load in the brain cortex was higher than in other regions of the CNS in both jaOArS982 and jaTH160-infected mice. the levels of TNF-, IFN-, IL-2 and IL-10 were significantly higher in jaTH160-infected mice than in jaOArS982-infected mice. cytokine levels were very low or undetectable in mock-infected mice and in infected mice at 5 days pi. IL-2 in spleens were up-regulated in jaOArS982-infected mice at 5 and 9 days pi. levels of IFN-, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10 were not significantly different between jaOArS982 and jaTH160-infected mice. inflammatory responses in peripheral organs were different from those in the CNS. viral genome sequences between recovered viruses from severe (S14, S15, S18 and S19) and mild (M17 replaced to M4, M10, M13 and M24) mice in each group were inoculated subcutaneously and observed for 21 days. mice exhibited more than 106 pfu/g of tissue in the severe DSG. these results imply that 45.8% (11/24) of mice in the mild DSG produced high viral loads similar to those in the severe DSG. it is likely that high viral infection alone is not a critical determinant of severe disease. inflammatory cytokines of TNF-, IL-10, IFN- and IL-2, but not IL-4 and IL-5 in the brain cortex compared with the uninfected group (UG) inflammatory infiltration with mononuclear cells in the brain cortex of both severe and mild cases of JaOArS982-infected mice. severe case showed acute neuronal necrosis in the brain cortex. Virus antigen-positive cells were the necrotic neurons. some JEV antigen-positive cells were the necrotic neurons. IL-10 in the serum of SG mice was significantly increased compared with UG and MHG mice. corticosterone levels in the serum were also significantly increased in SG mice compared with other groups (Figure S2B). severe cases resulting from infection with JaOArS982 exhibited a significant reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ doubly-positive cells in the thymus. mRNA levels of cytokines in the brain cortex of WT, TNF- KO and IL-10 KO mice infected with 104 pfu of jaOArS982 at 9 days pi. the levels of IFN, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6D (C) were quantified by real-time PCR. IL-10 KO and TNF- KO mice infected with jaOArS982 virus. there were no significant differences of infectious viral loads in the brain cortex. the range of viral infectivity varied from the lowest detection limit to 109 pfu/g of tissue at 9 and 11 days pi. uninfected mice showed significant differences of cytokine levels between the three groups. levels of perforin, granzyme B and FasL at 9 days pi and granzyme A at 11 days pi were significantly increased in TNF-KO mice compared with those of WT mice. IL-10 KO mice showed the increased level of perforin at 9 days pi. each experiment represents six and five mice of WT and TNF- KO respectively. inflammatory reactions and neuronal degeneration were seen in the WT mice. the level of IL-5 in TNF- KO was decreased compared with WT and IL-10 KO mice at 5 days pi. the patterns of cytokine levels observed in spleens were different from those of the brain and therefore peripheral responses are unlikely to contribute to the increased disease severity in TNF- KO mice. data of WT B6 mice at 5 and 9 days pi were same to Figure 1D. mRNA levels of IFN, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 in the brain cortex of WT, TNF-KO and IL-10 KO mice. levels of perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B and FasL were not increased in TNF- KO when compared with WT mice at 7 days pi. however, histopathological data showed that TNF- KO mice presented with severe acute necrotic changes in the brain cortex compared which was not the case for WT and IL-10 KO mice at 9 days pi. B6 mice were subcutaneously infected with 100, 102, 104 and 106 pfu of jaOArS982 and JaTH160. no mice died after 21 days and infectivity was determined by anti-JEV antibody seroconversion. each experiment represents six and four mice infected with JaOArS982 and JaTH160. a virus challenge dose of 104 pfu of either JaOArS982 or JaTH160 induced 100% infectivity. the cause of fatal disease was different between jaOArS982 and jaTH160. cytokine levels in the brain cortex were significantly higher than in other regions of the CNS in both jaOArS982-infected mice. cytokine levels of TNF-, IFN-, IL-2 and IL-10 were very low or undetectable in mock-infected mice and in infected mice at 5 days pi. fected mice showed no JEV antigen-positive neurons or inflammatory reactions. these results confirm that during the early phase of infection, JaTH160-infected mice developed severe encephalitis with extensive neuronal infection. infectious virus was either not detectable or very limited in spleens. levels of TNF- and IL-2 in spleens were up-regulated in jaOArS982-infected mice at 5 and 9 days pi. we initially considered the possibility that the divergence of disease severity might be due to the selection of quasispecies variants from the JaOArS982 virus population in the CNS. however, no specific virus sequence differences were detected in viruses from either the severe or mild disease severity groups (Figure 2A) compared viral loads in the brains of severe and mild cases of JaOArS982-infected mice at 13 days pi. mRNA levels of TNF-, IL-10, IFN, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 quantified by real-time PCR in the brain cortex of JaOArS982-infected mice. inflammatory infiltration with mononuclear cells in the brain cortex of both severe and mild cases of jaOArS982-infected mice. in mild cases, there was variation of pathological features in some JaOArS982-infected mice. in mild cases, there was variation of pathological features in some JaOArS982-infected mice. mice infected with 104 pfu of jaOArS982 at 13 days pi showed no pathological changes. each experiment represents five and sixteen mice of severe and mild cases. there were no significant differences of IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 levels between UG, SG and MLG mice. IL-10 in the serum of SG mice was significantly increased compared with other groups. corticosterone levels in the serum were also significantly increased in SG mice compared with other groups. KO and IL-10 KO mice were increased compared with those of WT mice (77.3%, 43.2% and 26.7%, respectively) mSTs of fatal cases in TNF- KO and IL-10 KO mice were significantly shorter than those of WT mice (15.5 2.14 days) the levels of IFN, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6D (C) and perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B and FasL (D) were quantified by real-time PCR. IL-10 KO and TNF-KO mice infected with jaOArS982 at 9 days pi. IL-10 KO mice showed increased levels of IFN-, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 compared with those of WT mice at 9 and 11 days pi. IL-10 KO mice showed increased levels of IFN-, IL-1, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-6 compared with those of WT mice at 9 and 11 days pi. trated cells involving leukocytes (CD45), T cells (CD3, CD4 or CD8), B cells (CD19), NK cells (NK1.1) and macrophages (F4/80) did not appear to differ significantly between TNF- KO and WT mice. these observations suggest that the increased levels of cytokines in TNF-KO mice were due to qualitative differences of their expression in inflammatory cells. levels of IFN- in TNF- KO mice were significantly increased compared with those of WT and IL-10 KO mice at 5 and 9 days pi. IL-2 and IL-4 levels in TNF- KO mice were significantly higher than those of WT and IL-10 KO mice during mock infection. survival curves of IL-10 KO (n=15) and TNF- KO (n=14) mice. mRNA levels of IFN, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 in brain cortex. TNF-a KO mice exhibited acute necrotic changes in the brain cortex. levels of IFN- and IL-5 in the brains were not increased when WT and TNF-KO groups at 5 and 7 days pi were compared. however, levels of IL-2 and IL-4 in the brains were not increased when WT and TNF-KO groups at 5 and 7 days pi were compared. TNF-/- mice showed significant mortality rates when compared with WT mice. however, there were no significant differences in viral load in the CNS. IL-10 KO mice also showed increased mortality and up-regulated levels of inflammatory cytokines in the CNS. cytokine exerts homeostatic and pathological effects in the CSF [60]. cytokine exerts greater efficacy of immunoregulatory function during JEV infection. administration of anti-mouse antibody also showed no improvement of disease outcome. in the CSF, increased levels of TNF- in the brains of severe cases in WT mice were probably produced in response to the disease severity, to alleviate the pathological impact of the encephalitis. the increased levels of inflammatory cytokines including Fas and the granular exocytosis correlated with severe encephalitis and fatal outcome. specific TCR repertoires were detected in dying mice during TBEV infection [65] compared with the recovering mice following jaOArS982 infection. this suggests there may be a variety of specific T cell clones effecting protective or pathogenetic functions in dying and recovering mice. there were 17 amino acid differences in the genomic sequences of JaTH160 and JaOArS982. it will be important to determine whether specific amino acid substitutions can influence TNF- expression and thus contribute to the pathogenesis of the lethal process during jaTH160 infection. time PCR in the spleen of mice infected with 104 pfu of jaOArS982. mRNA levels of TNF-, IL-10, IFN, IL-2, IL-4 and IL-5 quantified by real-time PCR in the brain cortex of jaOArS982-infected mice at 13 days pi. each experiment represents four and fifteen mice of severe and mild cases. each experiment represents four and fifteen mice of severe and mild cases. each experiment represents four and fifteen mice of severe and mild cases. mRNA levels of perforin, granzyme A, granzyme B and FasL in brain cortex. mRNA levels of IFN, IL-2, IL-4, IL-5 in the spleen of WT, IL-10 and TNF- mice at 5 days pi."}
