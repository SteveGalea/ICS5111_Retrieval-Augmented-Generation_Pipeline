{"summary": "coVs are large, enveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses that can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases in a range of animals, including humans. there are six human coronaviruses (HCoVs), HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-HKU1 and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. as of 15 June 2017, there were 2015 laboratory confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection and 703 deaths in 27 countries. the emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV suggests that highly pathogenic HCoVs remain a key threat to human health. molecular tests are accepted worldwide as an important method for diagnosing HCoV infection. however, most of the current molecular methods target a single HCoV gene, which limits their application because of the mutations that can occur in HCoV genomes. false negative results can be returned because they are only targeting one gene. the mCoV-MS method uses multiplex PCR conjugated MALDI-TOF MS technology to achieve high-throughput CoVs detection. the method was divided into three stages: multiplex PCR, primer extension and MALDI-TOF MS identification. panel A: including specific primers and extension probes targeting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and nucleocapsid (N) genes of six HCoVs, and ribonuclease P (as an internal control) panel B: including specific primers and extension probes targeting the ORF1b gene and regions upstream of the E gene (upE) the iPLEX reaction (single-base extension reaction) mix included 0.2 l terminator mix, 0.94 l extension probe mix, 0.2 l iPLEX Pro buffer, and 0.041 l ThermoSequenase enzyme. all data were acquired and analyzed using Typer software, v4.0.3 (Agena Bioscience, Inc.) all experiments (collection of samples, sample handing, operator training and protection, etc.) were carried out according to the approved biosafety standard guidelines set by the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences & Peking Union Medical College. 131 nasal and throat swabs were screened using the mCoV-MS method. four common HCoVs were also screened by using PCR or nested PCR assays. the primary PCR and iPLEX reaction of the mCoV-MS method was performed in a 384-plate by using a ProFlex PCR system. the reaction conditions of primary PCR were 45\u00b0C for 2 min; a denaturing step of 2 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 56\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. the plasmids were diluted to a series of concentrations of 1, 10, 100 1,000, and 10,000 copies per reaction. the test of each plasmid concentration was performed in triplicate. all samples used in this study were obtained from collections at our institute. the mCoV-MS method involved 384 pharyngeal and/or anal swab samples collected from bats (n = 352) or rodents (n = 32) the results were compared with those of other methods. to screen for SARS-CoV and SARS-like CoV, we used a qPCR assay developed by Corman et al. (2012a,b). Statistical analysis We tested the differences between the detection rates of the two different methods using the 2 test. A P 0.05 was considered statistically significant. we used 32 HCoV-positive samples to evaluate the common HCoV assays and MERS-CoV assays. a panel of common respiratory viruses (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A, respiratory syncytial virus B, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus A, human metapneumovirus B, rhinovirus, human enterovirus 71, to screen bat and rodent samples using the mCoV-MS method we used 352 pools of bat pharyngeal and anal swab samples to validate the performance of mCoV-MS. these samples were collected in 22 provinces which is a part of our bat virome project (Wu et al., 2016). ies mCoV-MS results PCR results Virome analysis results* Panel A Panel B NGST results full-length sequence obtained B1 Fu Jian Hipposideros armiger SARS_upE \u2013 lineage-B beta-CoV \u2013 B3 Guang Xi Rhinolophus sinicus SARS_N, ORF1b, upE lineage-B beta-CoV lineage-B beta-CoV lineage-B beta-CoV KJ4738 a total of 4 (12.5%) pools were classified as lineage-A Betacoronavirus by panel B assays and PCR-sequencing. a total of 4 (12.5%) pools were classified as lineage-A Betacoronavirus by panel B assays and PCR-sequencing. the mCoV-MS method detected HCoVs in 22.14% (29/131) of samples. this result was identical to that when we used mCoV-MS method. negative controls yielded no positive results for the mCoV-MS method. we used 32 HCoV-positive samples to evaluate the common HCoV assays and MERS-CoV assays. a panel of common respiratory viruses (influenza A virus, influenza B virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus A, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, human metapneumovirus A, human metapneumovirus B, rhinovirus, human enterovirus 71, coxsackievirus A16, human bocavirus 1\u20133, WU polyomavirus, and KI polyomavirus) were also used in this study all the 17 pools obtained SARS-upE-positive results. only 8 (47.1%) were detected by the panel B assays. the remaining three pools (0.9%) were identified as Alphacoronavirus by panel B assays. lineage-B beta-CoV lineage-B beta-CoV KJ473811 B9 Liao Ning Rhinolophus ferrumequinum SARS_upE \u2013 lineage-B beta-CoV lineage-B beta-CoV \u2013 B10 Jiang Xi Myotis ricketti SARS_upE \u2013 lineage-B beta-CoV \u2013 B11 Ning Xia Plecotus auritus SARS_ mCoV-MS method detected HCoVs in 22.14% (29/131) of samples. mCoV-MS method detected HCoVs in 22.14% (29/131) of samples. emergence of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV tested our ability to design new diagnostic methods for their rapid detection. it took several months to confirm the causative agent as SARS-CoV. advances in molecular technology, especially NGST, allows us to timely and accurately identify MERS-CoV. a multidisciplinary team of virologists isolated MERS-CoV from dromedary camels. the identification indicates that viral cross-species transmission is a real threat to human health. it is possible there are additional CoVs circulating in the wild that could infect humans. multiple methods targeting different genes of MERS-CoV have been developed and used to detect MERS-CoV. corman et al. successfully developed several qPCR assays targeting upE, ORF1b and ORF1a. the availability of fluorescent dyes limits the multiplexing capacity of their qPCR assay. the mCoV-MS method is flexible and can be modified as necessary. there are 10 countries in or near the Arabian Peninsula with laboratory-confirmed MERS cases. the largest known outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula occurred in the Republic of Korea in 2015. mCoV-MS method is based on the known CoVs sequence. it is difficult to detect a new HCoV only use mCoV-MS method. it can provide clues for new HCoV detection compared to current methods. http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2017.01510/full#supplementary-material Click here for additional data file."}
