{"summary": "spillover is predicated on ecological interactions between the infected bat, the pathogen and the recipient host species. a series of connected enabling conditions are necessary for spillover of emerging bat viruses. bats must be infected and in most cases shedding pathogen. bats are unusual in the extent to which they host zoonotic viruses compared with ecologically similar taxonomic groups, such as rodents. recent surveillance has discovered new bat viruses with zoonotic potential (e.g. [10,11]). these viruses may be spilling over undetected, particularly where disease surveillance is poor. endemic in Australian Pteropus spp. (fruit bats or flying-foxes) (electronic supplementary material, appendix S1). the persistence and propagation of viruses occur at multiple levels: cell of host, individual host, population of hosts, community of host species and landscape. to persist at the population level, viruses must replicate, exit from and be transmitted among hosts. the unusually low level of viral shedding from bats leads to hypotheses consistent with the distinct ecology of bats. many bat species have dense, three-dimensional roost structures that facilitate indirect transmission through droplets or aerosols of viruses excreted in urine or faeces. enabling conditions for spillover of virus from bats require a series of hierarchical conditions. reservoir hosts must be present; reservoir hosts must be infected. recipient hosts must be exposed to the source of the virus in sufficient quantity. in 2011, there was an unprecedented cluster of 18 spillover events. the annual number of spillovers in 2012 (eight) and 2013 (eight) was well above the pre-2011 average (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). overlapping distribution of reservoir and recipient hosts crudely delineates areas where recipient hosts are at risk of infection. shifting bat distributions, human population growth and changes in land use collectively increase the area and incidence of co-occurrence between bats and grazing horses. high-quality but ephemeral nectar resources in native flowering forests can support large, seasonally migratory or even nomadic bat populations. new evidence suggests that virus excretion from bats may occur in spatial and temporal pulses that can drive spillover. clusters of Nipah virus spillover in Bangladesh, marburg virus spillover in Uganda and Hendra virus spillover in Australia have been associated with pulses of shedding from bats. two hypotheses may explain temporal and spatial pulses of virus shedding in bat populations. these two processes have different drivers at the level of individuals, roosts and metapopulations. if persistent infections are suppressed by the host's immune response [9,48], viral replication and episodic shedding could occur. studies in which bats were held in presumably stressful conditions have not supported stress as a driver of shedding. stress in captive and wild populations may have different effects on host\u2013virus interactions. relapsing (recrudescent) Hendra and Nipah virus encephalitis in humans has been used to support the theory of episodic shedding from bats. limited sample sizes and experiment durations restricted their ability to assess virus clearance. decreases in migration observed in urban bat populations could disrupt transmission among host populations, reducing colony immunity and increasing the magnitude of epidemics when the virus is reintroduced. environmental conditions common among bat populations may have synchronized shedding by synchronizing stress [30] or may have synchronized transmission dynamics by creating similar density-dependent processes among populations [55] definitive evidence that bats are persistently infected with emerging viruses can only come from longitudinal studies of individual bats that are isolated from re-exposure. the amount of virus shed from bats is determined by the number of bats present, the amount of time bats spend within the area, the shedding status of bats and the viral load excreted. the concentration of virus in the environment is affected by the quantity of virus that bats are shedding and the probability of virus survival outside of the bat host, which in turn are affected by the factors in (a) contaminated vessels used to collect date palm sap are source of Nipah virus. Exceptions to drip-zone transmission may occur when flying bats eliminate or drop partially eaten fruit. horses grazing on pastures with low nutritional quality may eat bark, tree leaves and twigs for fibre. fulminating infection may fall at one end of a spectrum of Hendra virus disease in horses. some horses may eliminate infection in the mucous membranes of the upper respiratory tract with rapid and effective innate immune responses. others may seroconvert asymptomatically or seroconvert and recover after clinical disease. high-quality but ephemeral nectar resources in native flowering forests can support large, seasonally migratory or even nomadic bat populations. but when nectar flows are diminished due to seasonal conditions, habitat loss or climate change, bats seek alternative food sources in urban and peri-urban areas. black flying-fox have a stronger association with Hendra virus spillover events than other flying-fox species. high prevalence in urine pools was sustained for two to three months [32] Nipah virus prevalence in pooled bat urine was 22% following cases in humans in Bangladesh, but declined to 0% over two months [29], suggesting detection may be more likely if sampling coincides with spillover. the link between nutrition and Hendra virus shedding should be a research priority. pregnancy in bats coincides with high seroprevalence and seasonal spillover of Hendra, Nipah and Ebola virus [25,26,30,47,49] h virus encephalitis in humans has been used to support the theory of episodic shedding from bats [50]. pathogenic mechanisms in novel recipient hosts do not provide evidence for related mechanisms in reservoir hosts. each host species is likely to have a different relationship with the pathogen. recur depend on interactions between population size, transmission rate, infectious period, host replenishment rate, lifespan, rate of loss of immunity, previous exposure and connectivity within and among subpopulations [30,52] there is no evidence that large populations of bats have been associated with periods of high prevalence or shedding of Hendra virus (electronic supplementary material, appendix S4) if persistent infections are suppressed by the host's immune response [9,48], viral replication and episodic shedding could occur when intrinsic or extrinsic stressors weaken the immune response. the link between nutrition and Hendra virus shedding should be a research priority. the occurrence of relapsing (recrudescent) Hendra and Nipah virus encephalitis in humans has been used to support the theory of episodic shedding from bats. however, relapsing infections have been associated with defective forms of virus that were not infectious. pathogenic mechanisms in novel recipient hosts do not provide evidence for related mechanisms in reservoir hosts. decreases in migration observed in urban bat populations could disrupt transmission among host populations, reducing colony immunity and increasing the magnitude of epidemics. the intensity of pulses of epidemic infection, and whether pulses fade out, reach a stable endemic state or recur, also depend on interactions among population size, transmission rate, infectious period, host replenishment rate, lifespan, rate of loss of immunity, environmental forcing, previous exposure and connectivity within and among subpopulations. fected with emerging viruses can only come from longitudinal studies of individual bats that are isolated from re-exposure. experiments, combined with field and modelling studies, will ultimately decipher the complex relations that drive the dynamics of bat viruses. transmission of virus from bats to non-volant species is most likely to occur indirectly via free virus particles shed from bats onto fomites or surfaces, or through virus-laden aerosolized urine or faeces. the concentration of virus in the environment is affected by the quantity of virus that bats are shedding and the probability of virus survival outside of the bat host, which in turn are affected by the factors in (a) the effectiveness of innate and acquired immunity determines whether horse exposure leads to fulminating infection. the winter peak of Hendra virus spillover events in the subtropics coincides with the period of lowest pasture productivity [62] ebola outbreaks in apes also occur during the dry season, when food is scarce and bat populations compete for fruit [3,47] emergence of bat viruses in recipient hosts requires at least five hierarchical enabling conditions. the probability of occurrence of each is conditional on the occurrence of the preceding condition; removal of any condition should prevent spillover. a recent vaccine for Hendra virus in horses initially had low uptake due to factors such as cost and lack of data in pregnant mares. winter in subtropical Australia is the peak of resource scarcity for both bats and horses.
