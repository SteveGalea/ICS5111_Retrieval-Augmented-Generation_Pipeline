{"summary": "coronaviruses have the largest single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes. group III contains avian viruses, including avian infectious bronchitis virus. nsp7 in a hexadecameric supercomplex with nsp8. single-stranded RNA-binding protein nsp9. zinc finger-containing protein nsp10. uridylate-specific endoribonuclease nsp15. a large number of interactions between MHV nsp2 and other viral proteins were discovered in SARS-CoV. expression of MHV nsp2 from alternative locations could not complement the modest growth defects caused by nsp2 deletion. the timing and/or interactions resulting from expression between nsp1 and nsp3 might be crucial for the function of nsp2 and for optimal replication. merase chain reaction (PCR) from the cDNA of IBV strain M41 with an additional 6His tag in the 3\u2032-terminus using PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase (Takara) the forward PCR primer for IBV nsp2 was 5\u2032-CG GGA TCC ATG GCT TCA AGC CTA AAA CAG GTA TCT CCC AAA CTA AG-3\u2032, containing a BamHI restriction site (bold) the cells were harvested by centrifugation and pellets were resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline buffer containing 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na2HPO4, 1.76 mM KH2PO4 pH 7.4. the cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 20 000g for 45 min. the target protein was initially purified using glutathione affinity chromatography crystallization Freshly prepared IBV nsp2 protein was concentrated to 20 mg ml1 in a buffer consisting of 20 mM MES pH 6.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 0.001% NP-40. all of these initial crystals showed poor diffraction quality. native and seMet-derivative crystals of IBV nsp2 protein grew in same conditions. X-ray diffraction analysis Single crystals of native IBV nsp2 were transferred into reservoir solution supplemented with 20%(v/v) glycerol. diffraction image was collected on beamline 17A at the Photon Factory, Tsukuba, Japan using an ADSC Q270 CCD detector. values in parentheses are for the highest resolution shell."}
