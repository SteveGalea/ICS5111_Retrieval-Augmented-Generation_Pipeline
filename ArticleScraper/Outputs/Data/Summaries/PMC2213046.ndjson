{"summary": "LCMV infection of adult B6 mice generates a robust CD8 T cell response, peaking at 8 or 9 d after infection and eventually establishing a stable virus-specific CD8 memory T cell pool (17, 18) the hierarchy of responses against different epitopes is very similar between immunologically naive mice. LCMV epitope-induced IFN- production from gated CD8 T cells costained with activation/memory marker CD44 for better resolution. the percentages of epitope-specific CD8 T cells before and after virus infections were determined (top right quadrants). individual mice could differ dramatically in the patterns of their cross-reactivities to heterologous viruses. they sought to compare epitope-specific responses after a heterologous viral infection to the hierarchy of the T cell repertoire in the LCMV-immune mouse. in 26 LCMV-immune control mice, the percentage of CD8 in the PBLs was 10.1 2.3%. the percentage of CD8 cells in the VV-challenged LCMV-immune mice was 20.5 4.5%. the increase in number is expected to be greater.

IL-7R down-regulation was 23\u201342% in some mice. LCMV-immune mice challenged with PV down-regulated IL-7R. LCMV-immune mice infected with homologous high dose (5 106 PFU) clone 13 strain of LCMV or heterologous VV 6 d after infection. the percentages above the top left quadrant represent the proportion of the IL-7Rlow subset out of the total epitope-specific CD8 T cells. LCMV-immune mice exhibit remarkably similar VV-induced responses among several recipient hosts. clones derived from three mice showed one V clonotype common to all three mice, but all others were unique to the individual mouse. this variation in epitope-specific TCR usage reveals a private TCR repertoire that we hypothesized might provide a basis for variability in the VV-induced T cell cross-reactivity against LCMV peptides. two representative experiments are shown out of 17 individual donor-recipients pairs. the results showed that multiple recipients of donor cells from an individual LCMV-immune donor mouse generated nearly identical epitope-specific responses on VV infection. GP33/34-specific CD8 T cells were preferentially expanded. A3 + B1 + B2 + B3 C1 + + C2 + + C3 + + D1 D2 D3 E1 + E2 + E3 + F1 + + + F2 + + F3 + + + G1 + + + + H1 + + + H2 + + + I1 + + + + I1 + + + + + J1 J2 K1 + + K2 + + L1 L2 M1 M2 N1 + N2 + O1 + O2 + LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells were visualized via IFN- assay. situations in which >50% of the epitope-specific T cells lack the CSFE label. VV-induced expansions in LCMV epitope\u2013specific T cells predict there may be cross-reactive epitopes between VV and LCMV. the frequency of A11R 198\u2013specific CD8 T cells was on average significantly higher (mean = 0.55% 0.59, n = 29) after a day 6 VV infection of LCMV-immune mice (P = 0.03) was highly variable, suggesting a private specificity phenomenon. 6 out of 19 LCMV-immune mice challenged with VV made relatively strong (>1.5% of CD8 T cells) responses to the A11R 198 peptide. four of the A11R 298 responders (mouse nos. 4, 7, 10, 12, 13) also responded to the GP33/34 epitope. donor-derived A11R 198\u2013specific CD8 T cells upon VV infection were confirmed. the integrity of the LCMV epitope-specific memory CD8 T cell pool is often disrupted by heterologous viral infections. PV and LCMV share strongly cross-reactive subdominants that dominate the immune response when these viruses are infected in sequence. representative figures are shown for 3 out of 10 PV-infected and out of 26 LCMV-immune mice. the relative proportion of LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells in the individual LCMV-immune mice was compared before (white bar) and after (black bar) VV infections. a longitudinal analysis method was used to address the impacts of heterologous PV or VV infections on LCMV-immune mice. a peptide epitope-induced intracellular IFN- assay was used to identify and quantify epitope-specific T cells. analysis of individual LCMV-immune mice revealed some small variations in the magnitude of the T cell response. the increase in the number of putatively cross-reactive LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells was less dramatic and more subtle than the expansion observed during PV infection. in 26 LCMV-immune control mice, the percentage of CD8 in the PBLs was 10.1 2.3%, while the percentage of CD8 cells in the VV-challenged LCMV-immune mice was 2.5%. the percentage of LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells in 26 LCMV-immune individual mice before and after VV infection was determined via IFN- assay. the GP33/34-specific response (directed at either of two overlapping epitopes) was most favored, and the 100% preservation of this GP33/34-specific response actually represents a 260% increase. despite the variable and unpredictable nature of the responses of individual mice, there were overall preferences in responses to some epitopes over other epitopes. this can be seen in Table I, which shows the percent recovery of the epitope-specific T cells from 26 individual LCMV-immune mice before and after VV infection. NP205-specific T cells increased from the day 4 time point. this represents a marked increase in cell number from the day 12 time point. the epitope-dependent increases in cell numbers suggested there was a variable epitope-dependent proliferation of LCMV-specific T cells induced by VV infection. LCMV-immune mice challenged with PV down-regulated IL-7R only on highly cross-reactive NP205-specific T cells. IL-7R down-regulation was 23\u201342% in some mice (nos. 1 and 2) on GP33/34-specific T cells, on another mouse on GP118-specific T cells (no. 3), and on another on NP205-specific T cells (no. 2). outlined boxes indicate the epitope-specific CD8 T cells. >20% of the subset show down-regulation of IL-7R. representative data are shown for 3 out of 10 VV-infected LCMV-immune mice. CFSE-labeled LCMV-immune donor cells derived from a single donor were transferred into multiple hosts, which were infected with VV. LCMV-immune CD8 T cells from a single donor exhibit remarkably similar VV-induced responses among several recipient hosts. GP33/34 and NP205-specific CD8 T cells were preferentially expanded. in contrast, preferential expansion was observed in both GP33/34 and NP205-specific CD8 T cells among all the recipients of cells from LCMV-immune donor B. LCMV-immune donor mice (A, B, and 3) were adoptively transferred into two or three recipient mice (1, 2, and 3) that were then infected with VV. donor-derived LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells were then transferred into two or three recipient mice (1, 2, and 3). VV-induced expansions in LCMV epitope\u2013specific T cells predict cross-reactive epitopes between VV and LCMV. the high incidence of expansion of T cells specific to the NP205 epitope suggests that VV may encode epitopes cross-reactive with NP205. VV-encoded epitope cross- reactive with LCMV-specific T cells. the frequencies of VV-derived A11R 198 epitope-specific CD8 T cells were followed via IFN assay in the peripheral blood of individual LCMV-immune mice. 6 out of 19 LCMV-immune mice challenged with VV made relatively strong (>1.5% of CD8 T cells) responses to the A11R 198 peptide were confirmed via adoptive transfer experiments with CFSE-labeled cells. the day 6 response to A11R 198 is compared with the nearly always poor GP276 response in either recipient. LCMV-immune mice elicit a more subtle and less predictable expansion of LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells. this work was initially based on the puzzling observation that, unlike LCMV-infected mice challenged with PV, elicits a more subtle and less predictable expansion of LCMV epitope\u2013specific CD8 T cells. a VV-encoded peptide with sequence similarity to NP205, GP118, and GP34-41 detected a higher proportion of cells in VV-challenged LCMV-immune mice, but its frequencies also varied greatly between mice. the mathematically predicted potential T cell diversity (1015) is far greater than the estimate of actual diversity (2 108) observed in mice. the hierarchy of T cell responses specific to the various LCMV epitopes is remarkably similar between mice immune only to LCMV. the NP205 response was frequently stimulated in VV-infected LCMV-immune mice. it may be anticipated that challenge with a cross-reactive heterologous virus might amplify only a subset of the T cells specific to a given epitope of a previously encountered virus. the variation in TCR usage between individuals provides an opportunity for them to have remarkable diversity in their T cell cross-reactivities with diverse pathogens. the diversity of VV-induced LCMV epitope\u2013specific responses in LCMV-immune mice suggest there may be many potential epitopes that could be recognized by T cells cross-reactive between the two viruses. the significance of this work is in the understanding of the basic concepts of heterologous immunity. the replication of VV is reduced in LCMV-immune mice in comparison to naive mice.
