{"summary": "the purpose of this study is to establish teaching hospital accreditation standards anew with the hope that Taiwan's teaching hospitals can live up to the expectations of our society. the development process lasted two years, 2005-2006, and was separated into three stages. the first stage centered on leadership meetings and consensus building, the second on drafting the new standards with expert focus groups. the total number of accredited hospitals had reached 500, and over 100 were teaching hospitals. the old standards were too structure-oriented and did not put enough emphasis on process and outcomes. the scale of accreditation grew too big for the DOH to handle with its own staff, and too burdensome for hospitals receiving on-site visits. a level hospitals tend to provide tertiary care and are larger hospitals in terms of bed numbers. a level hospitals tend to provide tertiary care and are larger hospitals in terms of bed numbers, with over 500 acute care beds. a level hospitals tend to provide tertiary care and are larger hospitals in terms of bed numbers. establishing a better teaching hospital accreditation system can help cultivate excellent physicians and other health care professionals. the development process lasted for two years, 2005-2006, and was separated into three stages. the first stage centered on leadership meetings and consensus building. the second stage centered on drafting the new standards with an expert focus groups. research and results (9 items), development of faculty and continuing education (8 items), academic exchanges and roles and function of the hospital in the community (8 items), and administration (8 items). feedback gathered from the pilot study aimed at improving the standards. twenty four hospitals volunteered and yet only 11 were selected by random stratified sampling. the teaching survey team for hospital accreditation should survey both medical and paramedical education. the weighting of research and teaching should be adjusted. the survey results should emphasize qualitative description rather than quantitative scores. four surveyors were dispatched for medical education and one for paramedical education. whereas for institutions training only resident doctors, three surveyors were sent, including two for medical education and one for paramedical education. results Eleven hospitals participated in the pilot study selected through stratified random sampling. 202 91.8 18 8.2 Teaching and training plans and their outcomes (43 items) 433 91.6 40 8.5 Research and results (9 items) 78

19.3 Total (96 items) 941 89.1 115 10.9 For category two teaching and training plans and outcomes, the pass rate was the lowest pass rate was 54.6% for standard 6.3.1, mandating separate funding for teaching, research and advanced study. after post-test revision, although there are still 6 categories, some of the category titles and 16 standards were modified. the whole set therefore consists of 6 categories and 95 standards. category 1, educational resources, includes standards for faculty, equipment, libraries, and training facilities. the structural aspect, such as the amount of hardware and the credentials of faculty, can be dealt with by pre-survey file reviews. in this category, standard 1.1.5 had the lowest pass rate in our pilot study. the PGY1 program requires medical graduates to participate in a three-month general medicine training program during the first year of residency. it includes fundamental courses and training in general internal medicine, general surgery and community medicine. the goal is to expand this training program to a one-year program in 2011. each standard will be given four scoring levels: A, B, C and D. the passing grade requires 25% of the full time attending physicians to publish at least one academic paper. the final results of teaching accreditation hinge on the sum of all the scores. the final results of teaching accreditation hinge on the sum of the scores. arbitrary manipulation by government or TJCHA officials is minimized. the disadvantage is that extra mechanisms have to be put in place to ensure the objectivity of the scoring processes. the TJCHA does not apply any mathematical manipulation afterwards. the new teaching hospital accreditation standards launched in the first decade of the 21st century consist of six categories and 95 standards. the new standards have also been extended to professionals in nursing, pharmacy, radiation technology and clinical laboratories. authors declare that they have no
