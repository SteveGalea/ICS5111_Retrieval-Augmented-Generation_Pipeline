{"summary": "hepatitis B is a serious infectious disease of the human liver caused by the hepatitis B virus. more than 2 billion people have been infected with the virus at some time in their lives. over 1 million people die of chronic hepatitis and serum hepatitis. HBx can restrain cellular proliferation either by deregulating the action of cyclin-dependent kinases to affect cell cycle progression checkpoints (24) or by inducing the diverse effect on anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic properties linked with p53 family of proteins to determine cell fate. several studies have addressed the role of HBx by targeting it using either short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) (27, 28) or siRNA for cessation of H a small interface helix of HBx (residues 88\u2013101) has been previously crystallized as a part of complex with another protein, protein Data Bank code 3i7H (36). a small interface helix of HBx (residues 88\u2013101) has been previously crystallized as a part of complex with another protein, protein Data Bank code 3i7H (36). a library of 14,400 compounds was evaluated for the best HBx binder. a 3D grid was designed around the active site helix of the stable ligand conformations using default parameters. the library was evaluated for the best HBx binder by virtual screening. a subset of 100 compounds with top affinity score from the filtered set was selected for experimental evaluation. a subset of 100 compounds with top affinity score from the filtered set was selected for experimental evaluation. the expression of GFP in the transgenic lines was visualized and quantitated. a reversion assay was used as a drug screening platform. a real-time RT-PCR analysis of GFP transcript showed relative abundance of GFP in different cell lines. we first re-investigated the potential RSS activity of HBx. the RNAi sensor line was transfected with a plasmid containing the HBx gene to transiently overexpress the HBx protein. the HBx protein caused at least 2-fold higher GFP reversion when compared with the mock-transfected cells under similar conditions. a total of 26 compounds from the test set were screened. none of the compounds demonstrated anti-HBx activity. IR415 was found to have a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on HBx. dsRNA substrates by commercially available human Dicer enzyme generates siRNAs of 22 mers. 1 unit of human Dicer enzyme was able to process the dsRNA substrates into siRNAs (22 bp) 2 g of HBx protein blocked Dicer processing, thus completely inhibiting siRNA biogenesis. dicing reaction with RNA substrate, Dicer protein, HBx, and 0.1 mm IR415. lane 6, commercially synthesized 22-mer siRNA control of the dsRNA. lane 7, dicing reaction with RNA substrate, Dicer, purified HBx, and nonspecific/random compound from library. equilibrium dissociation constant (kd) or the \u201coff rate\u201d was found to be 8.475 103 s1. kd/ka was found to be 2.00 109 m or 2 nm. analysis of molecular interaction of IR415 with HBx by SPR. plasmid containing full-length HBV viral genome of 3.2 kb (pHBV) was harvested 48 h after the transfection and ELISA analysis was carried out. transfected cells were treated with tenofovir, a drug currently being used against HBV proliferation. as a positive control, transfected cells were treated with tenofovir. antigen titers were counted for HepG2 cells transfected with full-length pHBV plasmid that contained 3.5 kb HBV genome. tenofovir is considered as positive control and DMSO as negative control. 48/48 h indicates 48-h incubation of pHBV for viral proliferation. the five predicted conformational models (M1\u2013M5) were manually scrutinized for the interface helix (residues 88\u2013101) (36). the generated 3D HBx model was subjected to molecular dynamics (MD) simulation for evaluation of its conformational stability in explicit water-solvent environment. in total, 1392 compounds were retained with very high affinity for HBx surface. a more stringent filtration criterion was applied on selected compounds. a subset of 100 compounds with top affinity score from the filtered set was selected for experimental evaluation. the expression of GFP in the transgenic lines was visualized and quantitated by microscopic, quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR), and FACS analyses. a reversion assay in HepG2 cells was used as a drug screening platform. the HBx protein caused at least 2-fold higher levels of reversion compared to the RNAi sensor line. the HBx protein caused at least 2-fold higher GFP reversion. the putative small molecule(s) were identified as potential HBx-inhibitor(s) the fold reduction was plotted as a ratio of tGFP levels from cells treated with putative drug candidates versus control untreated cells where only HBx expression occurred. in vitro dicing assay involves processing of long dsRNA substrates by commercially available human Dicer enzyme that generates siRNAs of 22 mers. 1 unit of human Dicer enzyme was able to process the dsRNA substrates into siRNAs (22 bp), whereas 2 g of HBx protein blocked Dicer processing. the gel was stained with ethidium bromide, photographed, and subjected to densitometric analysis. lane 1, RNA substrate 900 bp as a control (in vitro transcribed); lane 2, dicing control (dicing reaction with 1 unit of Dicer protein and 1 g of RNA); lane 3, dicing reaction with RNA substrate, Dicer protein, and 2 g of purified HBx. sensograms were recorded upon addition of different concentrations of the drug. the binding of IR415 increased linearly with time and concentration. the analysis of the sensogram revealed linear increase in interaction. x protein used for dicing assay and SPR experiments. IR415 was expected to have an impact on HBV replication. we then analyzed the effect of IR415 on HBV replication. IR415 inhibits HBV replication by blocking the HBx suppressor activity. antigen titers were counted for HepG2 cells transfected with full-length pHBV plasmid that contained 3.5 kb HBV genome. a number of viral encoded suppressors have been identified from several animal viruses that display RNAi suppression activity. the group has recently identified NS4B and HBx as viral suppressor proteins in dengue and hepatitis B viruses. RNAi suppressor proteins add to the repertoire of targets for the multidimensional antiviral therapies. the most fit small molecule\u2013HBx interactions predicted by AutoDock Vina were selected for in vivo drug profiling studies. we performed biological screening of small-molecular-weight compounds through high-throughput screening platform based on reversal of silencing assay developed by us (9, 12, 13) the high-throughput screening platform employs a laboratory-developed GFP-expressing HepG2 cell line that also carries a GFP-shRNA gene. IR415 has been used in the presence of a viral suppressor protein. a reversion of GFP was scored with the latter protein. the molecular properties of the compound IR415 are given in supplemental table S1. IR415 blocks the suppressor activity of HBx and allows siRNA biogenesis. a difference in the in vivo and in vitro effective concentrations of IR415 could be a consequence of differential rate of drug uptake in the discussed approaches. decreased replication of HBV results in decreased expression of HBV antigens as well (51). IR415 was just as effective in suppressing HBV RNA levels as tenofovir. this is the first report that identifies a small-molecular-weight pharmacological active compound which binds a viral suppressor protein. box was designed using PyRx interface around the interface helix on HBx surface. the docked compounds were shortlisted for scrutinizing their drug-likeliness using QED software. monoclonal colonies were observed and sorted using a BD FACSJazzTM cell Sorter. stock solutions were prepared at concentration 10 mm. putative compounds were tested at concentrations between 50 and 200 m. HBx protein purification HBx was cloned into pET28a vector. protein-containing fractions were pooled, purified to homogeneity. protein was dialyzed in 50 mm CAPS and 150 mm NaCl (pH 11.0) the drug IR415 was dissolved in 100% DMSO to a final concentration of 10 mm. dilutions were made prior to the experiment using phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.4, while maintaining a concentration of 2% DMSO in all samples. minimized systems were allowed to undergo constant volume dynamic equilibration (NVT) for about 50,000 steps. this is followed by constant pressure dynamics (NPT) of the semi-equilibrated structure for about 50,000 steps at 1 atmosphere. production simulations were carried out on the equilibrated structures. the cells were later sloughed and reseeded in a 100-mm plate in complete DMEM with puromycin concentration 1 g/ml to 3 g/ml for final selection pressure. total RNA was isolated from HepG2/GFP control cell and HepG2/GFP-shRNA RNAi sensor line. TM3.1(+), transfection reagent, and DMSO were exposed to transfected cells at a concentration of 200 m in 2% DMSO. all compounds were retested in triplicate in three independent experiments. library with similar structure with IR415 was used as a negative control to monitor nonspecific interaction in the dicing reaction. the result was visualized using a 5% native polyacrylamide gel for the UV visualization. HBx protein was immobilized on an S series CM5 sensor chip using 10 mm disodium tetra borate, pH 8.5, and 1 m NaCl, as suggested by the manufacturer. qRT-PCR qRT-PCR was performed using the Verso 1-Step RT-qPCR Kit. a cycle threshold (Ct) was taken into consideration and analyzed using the 2Ct method."}
