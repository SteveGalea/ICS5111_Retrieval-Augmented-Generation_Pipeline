{"summary": "entry of EBOV into cells is mediated by its sole glycoprotein (GP) is a target for therapeutic intervention (1, 2). EBOV entry is unusual in that it requires proteolytic priming of GP in endosomes followed by engagement of Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1), a thirteen-pass membrane protein that aids cholesterol transport from endolysosomes (LE/Lys) ine leukemia virus (MoMLV) particles containing Gag-mKO (red) in their core and the far-red probe 1,1\u2032-dioctadecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine-4-chlorobenzenesulfonate salt (DiD) incorporated into the pseudovirus membrane during particle production. pseudovirions expressing EBOV 21-kDa GP were added to a BSC-1 cell expressing NPC1-GFP. an overlay of the red (to detect Gag-mKO) and far-red (to detect the lipid dye, DiD) fluorescent images is presented, with the far-red (DiD) fluorescence pseudocolored blue. 43/482 double-labeled particles were observed to fuse, and all 43 fusion events occurred in NPC1+ LE/Lys. fusion is significantly depressed in cells treated with 200 nM bafilomycin (baf) or 10 M E64d. the pseudovirions contained the I544A fusion loop mutation. particle tracked in Fig. 2a fused 5.5 min after associating with an NPC1-GFP-tagged endosome. in this case, the Gag-mKO signal was lost, but the DiD signal remained the same, as seen upon fusion of moMLV pseudovirions bearing HIV Env in endosomes. five out of six observed VSV-G fusion events occurred in Rab5+ endosomes. fusion did not occur if target cells were pretreated with bafilomycin or E64d, chemical inhibitors that nullify. the 21-kDa EBOV GP pseudoparticles that fused did so after passage through GFP-Rab5-tagged endosomes. by the end of Movie S3, the endosome has lost most of its GFP-Rab5. by the end of Movie S3, the endosome has lost most of its GFP-Rab5. EBOV enters cells through LE/Lys that contain both NPC1 and TPC2. the virus particles then fuse with the limiting membrane of these LE/Lys. EBOV GP directs fusion in a LE/Lys that contains both NPC1 and TPC2. a more likely possibility is that TPC2 is required for LE/Lys maturation (23), which is clearly required for EBOV entry (23), which involves Ca2+-dependent endosome fusion (25\u201327). HEK293T/17cells (80% confluent) were transfected according to the Qiagen protocol. cells were then washed and covered with HEK293T medium without phenol red. cooled to 4\u00b0C for 15 to 30 min and then covered with the diluted MLV pseudovirion solution. the dishes were centrifuged for 1 h at 250 g (4\u00b0C) and then immediately transferred to a microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU 10 spinning-disk confocal unit, a 512-by-512 Hamamatsu 9100c-13 EM-BT camera. for 21-kDa EBOV GP (WT or I544A), pFurin was added. polyfect (Qiagen) (10 l per g DNA) was added. HEK293T/17cells (80% confluent) were transfected according to the Qiagen protocol. cells were transfected with the appropriate plasmid (7 to 8 h) and then replated on 35-mm glass-bottom tissue culture dishes for 16 to 40 h. the dishes were centrifuged for 1 h at 250 g (4\u00b0C) and then immediately transferred to a Nikon Eclipse TE2000-E microscope equipped with a Yokogawa CSU 10 spinning-disk confocal unit."}
