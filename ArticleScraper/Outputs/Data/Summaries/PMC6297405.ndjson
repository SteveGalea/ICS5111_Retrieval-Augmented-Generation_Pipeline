{"summary": "a total of 6,008 CAP patients were enrolled. the overall detection rate of the 11 atypical pathogens was 42.4% among 1,925 child CAP. the most frequent atypical pathogen among child SCAP was parainfluenza virus. 2.7\u201310 per 1,000 persons in european countries (1), 2.67\u201312 per 1,000 persons in the US (2,3) and 3.4\u201342.9 per 1,000 persons in Japan (2,3) CAP can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites etc. CAP was defined as a new or aggravated infiltrate in chest radiographs obtained within 72 hours before or after presentation. the immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients were all included. the immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with CAP were all included. children with CAP were identified as the SCAP cases if they had at least one of the following clinical features: severe disturbed general conditions, refusal to eat, dehydration, consciousness impairment. adults with CAP were identified as the SCAP cases if they had at least one of the following clinical features: severe disturbed general conditions, refusal to eat, dehydration, consciousness impairment. 60 mmHg, PaO2/FiO2 300, mechanical ventilation being needed, artery systolic pressure of less than 90 mmHg, septic shock, infiltration of more than one lung lobe increased by 50% during 48 hours after admission. oliguresis (urine output 20 milliliter per hour) or acute renal failure needing dialysis. a panel of atypical pathogens, including respiratory viruses, MP and CP, were performed on the extracted nucleic acids. the respiratory viruses included influenza virus A and B (FLU A, FLU B), influenza virus AH1N1 2009 pandemic and AH3N2 (AH1N1 2009, AH3N2), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3, 4 (PIV 1, 2, 3, 4), adenovirus the outcomes were predicted with the use of factors such as age, sex, smoke, underlying diseases (chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, chronic liver diseases, chronic kidney disease, immunosuppression, neurologic disorder, and other system disease) a total of 30 hospitals from all 16 districts of Beijing were recruited as sentinel hospitals. the immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients with CAP were all included, immunocompromised circumstances referred to: congenital immunodeficiency syndrome, receiving chemotherapy, or anti-rejection therapy, or corticosteroid therapy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection with a CD4 cell count of >200 per cubic millimeter. patients excluded if they had lung cancer or tuberculosis, pneumoconiosis, noninfectious interstitial lung disease, pulmonary edema, pulmonary atelectasis, pulmonary infiltration with eosinophilia, or pulmonary vasculitis. children with CAP identified as the SCAP cases if they had at least one of the following clinical features. septic shock, infiltration of more than one lung lobe increased by 50% during 48 hours after admission, oliguresis (urine output 20 milliliter per hour) or acute renal failure needing dialysis. the Chinese criteria of SCAP didn\u2019t include three minor criteria. influenza virus A and B (FLU A, FLU B), influenza virus AH1N1

respiratory tract infection from 2007 to 2010. the detection rates of pathogens of this study were obviously lower than those of Jain\u2019s (except for PIV among CAP children) the detection rates of M. pneumoniae varied considerably among these studies, likely due to a difference in testing methods and study populations. all of the studies indicated that M. pneumoniae was one of the very common pathogens of CAP patients in China, as was one of the important characteristics of CAP in China. denovirus 7 type caused higher fatality rate of Chinese child acute respiratory infectious disease than other types. despite our maximum effort, there were still some limitations in this study. first, bacterial pathogens were not tested, though they are very important to the etiology of CAP, especially in adult patients. these factors, except for having an age of 9 or younger, were significantly associated with death in hospital. findings suggest that the patient\u2019s health condition may play a more important role during the SCAP development process than these 11 atypical pathogens."}
