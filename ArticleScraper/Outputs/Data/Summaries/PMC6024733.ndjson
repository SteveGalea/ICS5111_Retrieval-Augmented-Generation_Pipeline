{"summary": "the DNA vaccine is a new vaccine with a bacterial plasmid as the antigen gene vector. the gene is expressed under host cell promoter regulation. the expressed antigen could be designed as an extracellular protein. some concerns about the vaccine include potential genomic integration and auto-immune response. both native [24] or recombinant bacteria can be used as a DNA vaccine carrier. the live bacterial vector does not only deliver DNA inside the host cell but also induces a potent immune response due to its immunogenic features. the mammalian expression cassette consists of a eukaryotic promoter for gene expression, 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032UTR) this OriV was used in the early generation DNA vaccines, such as pVAK1 to the latest generation of DNA vaccines. most DNA plasmids are based on antibiotic resistance genes as the selectable markers. this suggests that this OriV is still considered as an ideal ori for DNA vaccines [29,30] some studies combined a CMV promoter with other components. other non-viral promoters have been demonstrated to have comparable efficacy to the CMV promoter, such as collagen [41] and keratinocytes [42] promoters. the intranasal route has been thoroughly developed since it can hinder enzymatic reactions and withstand the high acidity conditions in the gut. vaccines administered through the intranasal route induce the same or better immune response compared with oral route vaccinations. cell components, including plasmids, are released and engulfed by dendritic cells. inside DCs, plasmids enter the nucleus through special compartments. antigen gene is expressed as extracellular protein, presented by class II MHC. non-pathogen bacteria such as lactic acid bacteria (LAB) [59,60] may be preferable for development as DNA vaccine carriers. the main disadvantage includes the likelihood of causing infection, particularly in infants and immunocompromised patients. LAB is also resistant to acidic conditions in the gastrointestinal (GI) system. probiotic bacteria reduce lactose intolerance symptoms, such as diarrhea and flatulence. some studies confirmed that L. lactis is able to transfer DNA plasmid to the host cells. the ability of L. lactis to transfer plasmid to mammalian cells in vivo was confirmed by the delivery of plasmid by L. lactis to murine epithelial membrane cells. pValac, a new plasmid, was successfully constructed and demonstrated its ability to be delivered to the interior of porcine kidney cell lines. Salmonella spp. is a Gram-negative bacterium that causes salmonellosis through orofecal routes. bacterium is suitable for oral administration as its natural infection route. but it can induce both mucosal and systemic immune responses. a recombinant attenuated Salmonella mutant strain has a hyper invasive phenotype that can invade the host cell, escape the endosomes, and reduce the bacteria apoptosis. several other manipulations have been studied to improve the ability of Salmonella spp. as a vaccine carrier. the cellular immune response was measured by the decrease in the number of endothelial cells that expressed TIE2 in vaccinated mice. the vaccine generated CD8+ T cells that lysed CD99 expressing cells, so fewer leukocytes were detected in the lesion area. L. monocytogenes spread to other cells making it an effective DNA vaccine carrier against cancer. the disadvantage of this organism is the pathogenicity that leads to cholecystitis in human. the mutant variant was confirmed to induce an immune response, but did not replicate in the gall bladder. y. enterocolitica is chosen as a DNA vaccine carrier because it can survive in host tissues for several days. y. enterocolitica was proven to deliver a DNA vaccine encoding for Brucella antigens bacterioferritin and P39."}
