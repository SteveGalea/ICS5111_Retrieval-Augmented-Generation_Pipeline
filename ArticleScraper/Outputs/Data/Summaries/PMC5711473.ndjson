{"summary": "the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) encoded by RNA viruses represent a unique and only category that doesn't include any DNA form during nucleic acid synthesis. the molecular mechanisms of the NAC are key contents to the understanding of polymerases. dependent DNA polymerase, DdDP), and the bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase (ddRP) all structures are manually oriented as dNTP/rNTP entry views. viral RdRPs have their fingertips interact with the top of the thumb, encircling the active site. ide, substrate nucleotide, and 2 universal aspartic acid residues complete the phosphoryl transfer reaction. the polymerase needs to translocate one position downstream on its template. the active site also resets to the open conformation at some point after catalysis and before the next substrate binds. the Y631 aromatic ring moves approximately 3.5, consistent with the distance between neighboring base pairs in nucleic acid duplexes. in the subsequent translocation step, the O-helix resets to the original position, with the side chain of Y631 pushing against the nascent base pair to reach the 1 position. the next template base (originally at +2 position) now reaches position +1.15. fine cross bars are used to assist visualization of O-helix swinging and translocation. -carbon of residue 636 near pivoting point is shown as a sphere. active site closure is featured by the motif A region around D233. an RdRP-specific aspartic acid residue (D238 in PV/EV71 RdRP motif A) plays a key role in the small-scale rearrangement leading to active site closure. the side chain rotamer change of the RdRP-specific aspartic residue back to its original position could provide limited force to push the ribose moiety. a recently reported translocation intermediate of EV71 RdRP was captured at a post-catalysis and pre-translocation state with an open conformation active site18. translocation partially occurred over the entire product strand and the polymerase active site reset to the open conformation. the translocation distance of the newly incorporated +1 nucleotide in this intermediate structure is less than one third of a full translocation step. dRP crystal structures exhibit 2 major conformation populations,28 with the side chain of C290 buried in a hydrophobic pocket. the \u201cIn\u201d to \u201cOut\u201d movement of the loop can provide a direct \u201cpush\u201d of the template strand backbone, facilitating the +1 phosphate to cross the T114/S115 hurdle in the late stages of translocation. the labeling of viral RdRP motifs is the same as in Fig. 2B. viral RdRPs appear to use distinct structural elements to control these 2 key processes. this offers possibilities for modulation of translocation independent of catalysis. this offers possibilities for modulation of translocation independent of catalysis. PPi-mediated pseudo-pyrophosphorolysis and PPi-mediated pyrophosphorolysis of the newly incorporated nucleotide both occur at the pre-translocation state. the new incorporated non-cognate nucleotide both occur at the pre-translocation state."}
