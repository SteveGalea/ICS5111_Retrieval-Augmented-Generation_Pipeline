{"summary": "a single A134V mutation in the 130-loop of the receptor binding domain is sufficient to render H5Anh the ability to generate H5Anh-pp efficiently. the reverse V134A mutation greatly hampers production of H5Cam-pp. avian influenza virus is highly pathogenic in poultry, certain bird populations, and has occasionally infected human causing severe clinical outcomes [1]\u2013[3]. since the first human outbreak in 1997, there have been more than 600 confirmed human cases of H5N1 infection with a mortality rate of approximately 60%. the virus may become more easily transmissible from bird to human or from human to human, posing a pandemic threat to public health worldwide. it is therefore important to fully understand the biology of H5N1 viruses and to develop sensitive and rapid diagnostic methods. however, an obstacle to the study of H5N1 viruses is the stringent safety requirement to work with them. several independent lines of evidence have identified molecular determinants in H5-HA for efficient incorporation into H5pp envelope. results are discussed in the context of the understanding of human host adaptation of avian influenza H5N1 viruses. H5Anh from A/Anhui/2005/01 resulted in very low luminescence levels. H5Cam from A/Cambodia/40808/2005 was the most efficient. luciferase reporter activity in MDCK target cells did not correlate with the level of HA protein expression. H5Anh can be incorporated into pseudotyped particles and released into the cell culture supernatant. this data suggests that H5Anh cannot be efficiently incorporated into pseudotyped particles and released into the cell culture supernatant.

HA protein expression in cell lysate was analysed using anti-FLAG antibody. there is an additional amino acid difference in the HA2 region at position 533. the cleavage site is located at the border between the ecto-domain and the transmembrane domain (TMD) there is an additional amino acid difference in the HA2 region at position 533. HEK293T cells were transfected as described in Fig. 1. no significant differences were found between Anh and any of the three chimerical constructs AnhCam1, AnhCam2 or AnhCam3. anhM6, which contains H5Cam-like 130-loop flanking sequences, did not generate efficiently H5Anh-pp in culture supernatant. two amino acid substitutions in the 130-loop of receptor binding domain of H5Anh are sufficient to induce H5Anh-pp production. -loop of the RBD of H5-HA is the critical determinant for efficient pseudotyping. two additional H5Anh mutants were generated with a single amino acid substitution either at position 133 (S133A, AnhM7) or 134 (A134V, AnhM8). these experiments revealed that the A134V mutation was sufficient to confer H5Anh the ability to be incorporated into transduction-competent pseudo-particles. H5pp was produced using H5Anh, H5Cam, their single or double mutants at position 133 and 134. NAvb was added 16 hr post transfection. luciferase activity was measured at 72 hr post H5pp transduction. cytometry plasma membrane expression levels of HA protein in cells transfected with H5Anh and H5Cam. cells were labelled with an anti-H5N1 antibody, fixed and stained with a PE-conjugated secondary antibody. soluble HA proteins were affinity-purified as described under Material and Methods. sH5Cam bound strongly to MDCK cells, whereas the single V134A change reduced the binding to a much lower level. sH5Cam bound weakly to MDCK cells, whereas the single V134A change reduced the binding to a much lower level. inefficiency of H5Anh-pp production is independent of the lentiviral backbone. inefficiency of H5Anh-pp production is not a mere consequence of the lentiviral system used for pseudotyping. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid coding for either H5Cam or H5Anh. lentiviral backbone used but can be rescued by co-transfection with viral N1 or in sialylation-deficient Lec2 cells. we examined the production of H5Cam-pp and H5Anh-pp in lec2 cells. the sialylation-deficient mutants are sialylation-deficient mutants of CHO cells. the reduced binding to sialic acid receptors is a major contributing factor for pseudotyping efficiency. hemagglutination assay of human and guinea pig viruses with or without the A134V substitution. guinea pig RBCs exhibit both alpha-2,3 and alpha2,6-linked sialic acid. hemagglutination assay of human and guinea pig viruses. human type O, horse and guinea pig blood were used for hemagglutination assays. the two isolates with valine at position 134 were unable to agglutinate horse red blood cells. results represent the average of two independent experiments. luciferase reporter activity assay was performed 48 hr post-transfection. we observed significant differences in the transduction of MDCK cells. luciferase reporter activity in MDCK target cells did not correlate with the level of HA protein expression in the cells. H5Anh was significantly less for H5Cam in presence of soluble bacterial neuraminidase than for H5Cam in presence of soluble bacterial neuraminidase. more importantly, incorporation of H5Anh into pseudotyped particles was not observed using anti-FLAG antibody. these data suggest that H5Anh cannot be efficiently incorporated into pseudotyped particles and released into the cell culture supernatant.

RG-A/Cambodia/408008/2005 with the A134V mutation has been shown to agglutinate to the same degree both human red blood cells (RBCs) and guinea pig RBCs, which exhibit both alpha-2,3 and alpha2,6-linked sialic acid, but failed to agglutinate horse RBCs, which carry only alpha-2,3-sialic acid. human type O, horse and guinea pig blood were used for hemagglutination assays. the two isolates with valine at position 134 were unable to agglutinate horse red blood cells. results represent the average of two independent experiments. mutants with or without sequence variations found at the poly-basic cleavage site (AnhCam1, AnhCam2 and AnhCam3) were generated and analysed. however, none of these mutants showed appreciable improvement in their ability to generate H5pp, when compared with wild type. the results of cell surface HA staining were similar. the fact that the A134V mutation increased cell surface expression of H5Anh may partially explain the effect of this amino acid substitution on H5pp production. it is likely that A134V mutation may have an impact on other properties of H5-HA, including binding to sialic acid receptors. alanine at position 134 (A134) showed stronger binding than those harbouring threonine (T134) to chicken erythrocytes (expressing both alpha-2,3 and alpha-2,6-sialic acid) and horse erythrocytes (expressing only alpha 2,3-sialic acid) alanine at position 134 (A134) is highly conserved in avian H5N1 viruses. so far only one avian H5N1 virus in the NCBI database has serine instead at position 134 of the HA protein. three human isolates of H5N1 viruses have a threonine and 11 a valine at position 134 [36] at least in two cases (A/Cam/408008/2005 and A/Thailand/676/2005), viruses found in the original patient specimens were mixtures of both wild type, containing A134 in the HA, and mutant virus, containing V134 [30], [35]. avian influenza viruses are produced from synthetic genes without the need to have access to the virus. the H5pp assay is more sensitive than micro-neutralization [16], [39]. it appears that its use in sero-epidemiological studies may be limited by the strain under investigation. a single A134V mutation is introduced in the receptor binding site. it is likely that the mutation leads to an increased level of cell surface HA expression. this mutation is so far only found in human isolates of H5N1 viruses.
