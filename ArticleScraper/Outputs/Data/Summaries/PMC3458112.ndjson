{"summary": "small RNAs of 20\u201330 nucleotides are mainly derived from digestion of RNA duplexes by the action of RNase III\u2013like nucleases called Dicer or Dicer-like (DCL) proteins. these small RNAs are then associated with effector complexes to guide sequence specific mRNA degradation, translational inhibition, or epigenetic modifications. RNA silencing plays a key antiviral role in plants, fungi and inverteb several vertebrate-infecting viruses also encode proteins with the ability to counteract RNA silencing. NS1 from Influenza A virus [26]\u2013[29], VP30, VP35 and VP40 from Ebola virus [28], [30], [31], NSs from La Crosse virus [32], 3 from mammalian orthoreovirus type 3 [33], E3L from Vaccinia virus [28], [29], Tas from Primate foamy birnaviruses contain a polyploid bipartite dsRNA genome that is packaged into a single virus particle [50] VP3 is a multitasking protein that has several activities throughout the viral life cycle. the genome of most dsRNA viruses is contained within a specialized icosahedral capsid involved in transcription and replication of the dsRNA genome. results IBDV VP3 Suppresses both Sense RNA and dsRNA-triggered RNA Silencing in plants. this prompted us to test whether IBDV VP3 could suppress RNA silencing in vivo. different plasmids expressing untagged and N-terminal TAP (NTAP)-tagged versions of IBDV VP3 were constructed and transferred to Agrobacterium tumefaciens. leaf patches infiltrated with p35S:GFP plus pMDC32-NS1, p35S-NTAP-NS1 or p35S-NTAP-P1b showed bright fluorescence at 6 dpa given the protection of GFP mRNAs from degradation by post-transcriptional gene silencing. VP3 protein from IBDV suppresses the RNA silencing. plasmid p35S:GF-IR and the P probe correspond to the 3\u2032 terminal region of the GFP gene. to induce RNA silencing, the GFP mRNA is firstly converted to dsRNA. no fluorescence was detected in the infiltrated patches at 6 dpa in the absence of silencing suppressors. NTAP-NS1 and NTAP-VP3 proteins appeared to abolish the generation of GFP siRNAs. however, the accumulation of siRNAs from the 3\u2032 terminal region of the GFP sequence is strongly inhibited by NTAP-P1b. purified VP3 samples were incubated with different dsRNA molecules. complexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis. IBDV VP3 binds long and short dsRNAs without apparent size specificity. Purified VP3 C (final concentration of 90, 180, 360, 720 and 1440 nM) and patch 1 or Patch 2 mutant VP3 (final concentration of 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1200 nM) were incubated with 32P-labelled 21-nt small RNAs. protein-IBDV genomic dsRNA complexes were resolved in agarose gels, stained with EtBr, and photographed under UV light. the VP3 patch 2 mutant caused a band shift of long dsRNA and ds-siRNA. both VP3 patch 1 and VP3 patch 1+2 appear to be completely unable to reduce the mobility of long dsRNA and ds-siRNA. the fact that VP3 C causes shifts of long dsRNA and ds-siRNA in similar manner than those produced by the wild type protein. leaf patches expressing p35S:GFP, p35S:GF-IR, and either pNTAP-VP3Patch1 or pNTAP-VP3Patch1+2 showed no GFP fluorescence at 6 dpa. northern blot analysis confirmed the fluorescence data since GFP mRNA was cleared from those tissues expressing VP3Patch1 or VP3Patch1+2 mutants at this time. IPNV and DXV VP3 proteins purified from insect cells were synthesized and introduced in the pFastBacHtb and NTAPi vectors to be expressed in insect cells and plants. the ability of these VP3 proteins to suppress RNA silencing was assessed in a dsRNA-triggered silencing assay in N. benthamiana plants. protein-dsRNA complexes resolved in agarose gels, stained with EtBr, and photographed under UV light. IBDV VP3 is able to support PPV Infection in the Absence of its natural Silencing Suppressor HCPro. the VP3 produced by PPV-VP3 is expected to have two extra aa (SD) at its N-end and a QVVHQ tail at its C-end. the coding sequence of the GFP protein inserted between the PPV and CP cistrons is represented with a green rectangle. a polyclonal serum specific for PPV CP was used for assessment of virus accumulation. immunoreaction with polyclonal sera specific for IBDV VP3 confirmed the identity of the infecting chimera. plants were biolistically inoculated with cDNA of PPV-VP3 and wild type PPV and HCPro deletion mutant (PPV-HC) clones. further observations at later time of infection (38 dpi) showed that plant infected with PPV-VP3 but not those infected with wild type PPV, recovered from viral infection. the recovery process was confirmed by Western blot analysis of samples collected at 38 dpi. this showed an obvious drop in PPV CP accumulation in older leaves when compared with younger leaves in PPV-VP3-infected plants. leaf patches infiltrated with p35S:GFP plus either pMDC32-VP3 or pNTAPi empty vectors displayed the highest intensity of GFP fluorescence at 2\u20133 days post-agroinfiltration (dpa) leaf patches infiltrated with p35S:GFP plus either pMDC32-NS1, p35S-NTAP-NS1 or p35S-NTAP-P1b showed bright fluorescence at 6 two different probes were used for detection of GFP siRNAs. the GF probe corresponds to the GFP fragment included in the inverted repeat RNA expressed from the trigger plasmid p35S:GF-IR. the P probe corresponds to the 3\u2032 terminal region of the GFP gene, which is not included in p35S:GF-IR. cumulation of specific siRNAs is a main hallmark of RNA silencing induction. in the sense RNA-triggered silencing assay, NTAP-P1b had very little effect on GFP siRNA accumulation. in contrast, both NTAP-NS1 and NTAP-VP3 proteins appeared to abolish the generation of GFP siRNAs. a 6xHis-tagged version of IBDV VP3 was produced and purified from insect cell cultures making use of recombinant baculoviruses. purified VP3 samples were incubated with different dsRNA molecules. complexes were resolved by gel electrophoresis. Purified IBDV VP3 protein (final concentration of 80, 160, 320, 640 and 1200 nM) was incubated with 32P-labelled 21-nt or 26-nt ds small RNAs. in both B and C, protein-IBDV genomic dsRNA complexes were resolved in agarose gels. mutants were engineered in pNTAP-VP3 and tested for their dsRNA binding capacity against the IBDV genomic RNAs. none of the multiple substitutions of positively charged amino acids affected the capacity of IBDV VP3 to form dimers. both VP3 patch 1 and VP3 patch 1+2 appear to be completely unable to reduce the mobility of long dsRNA and ds-siRNA. GF-IR, pNTAP-VP3Patch2, pNTAP-VP3C or the positive control pNTAP-P1b showed very high fluorescence levels. northern blot analysis confirmed an efficient protection of GFP mRNA from silencing degradation by the VP3Patch2 and VP3C mutants. birnaviridae family consists of viruses able to infect birds, such as IBDV, aquatic organisms and insects. the VP3 coding sequences of IPNV and Drosophila X virus (DXV) were synthesized and introduced in the pFastBacHtb and NTAPi vectors. VP3 proteins from fish- and insect-infecting birnaviruses suppress RNA silencing in a dsRNA-triggered test. protein-dsRNA complexes resolved in agarose gels, stained with EtBr, and photographed under UV light. HCPro is expressed as part of a genomic-length polyprotein. it is exscinded by the serine proteinase activity of the upstream protein P1 and its own cisteine proteinase activity. both ends of the VP3 coding sequence cloned in the PPV chimera were modified to generate cleavage sites recognized by P1 and NIa. Western blot analyses of plant tissue showing GFP foci collected at 9 dpi from inoculated leaves and at 22 dpi from upper non-inoculated leaves. a polyclonal serum specific for PPV CP was used for assessment of virus accumulation, whereas immunoreaction with polyclonal sera specific for IBDV VP3 confirmed the identity of the infecting chimera. similar levels of accumulation of PPV-VP3 and wild type PPV were detected in the inoculated leaves of plants infected with PPV-VP3. further observations at later time of infection (38 dpi) showed that plant infected with PPV-VP3 but not those infected with wild type PPV, recovered from viral infection. the recovery process was confirmed by Western blot analysis of samples collected at 38 dpi. 3 proteins of several birnaviruses are also able to counteract RNA silencing by preventing formation of siRNAs from dsRNA silencing inducers. plants have been previously used to identify and study VSRs derived from vertebrate-infecting viruses. we made use of two co-agroinfiltration assays in N. benthamiana plants. this includes dsRNAs with a length of 21-nt, which is the typical siRNA size class produced from RNA viruses during the infection cycle. the plant VSR P1b suppresses silencing by specific interaction with 21-nt small RNAs. both primary and secondary siRNAs were barely detected in leaves expressing either IBDV VP3 or NS1. a diminished dsRNA binding is enough to counteract the silencing machinery. the expression of VSRs is the general strategy used by plant viruses to counteract antiviral RNA silencing. some plants, like the potyvirus PPV, are unable to establish an infection in the absence of an active VSR. a broad range of insect viruses are known targets of antiviral RNA silencing. RNA silencing is an efficient antiviral immune response against the birnavirus DXV [86] but the mechanism used by the virus to counteract this antiviral defence remained uncharacterized. the best-studied VSR of an insect virus, the B2 protein of alphanodaviruses [23], [71], [79], has a functional counterpart in fish betanod the availability of deep sequencing technologies has recently allowed the identification of siRNAs derived from a wide set of mammal-infecting RNA viruses. these data, together with the observation that many mammal-infecting RNA viruses encode VSRs, suggest that RNA silencing of vertebrates is, to some extent, engaged in fighting against RNA viruses. all plants were grown in a greenhouse maintained at 16 hours light with supplementary illumination and a temperature range of 19\u201323\u00b0C. the construction of the rBV expressing a 6 His-tagged version of VP3 patch1 mutant was performed as follows. the generation of the rBV expressing a 6 His-tagged version of rBV hisVP3Patch2 mutant (rBV hisVP3Patch1+2) was performed using the approach described above. the construction of rBVs expressing the VP3 from DXV and IPNV was performed as follows. untagged CVYV P1b (pMDC32-P1b), untagged and TAP-tagged Influenza NS1 (pMDC32-NS1 and p35S-NTAP-NS1 respectively), untagged and TAP-tagged IBDV VP3 (p35S-NTAP-VP3patch1, p35S-NTAP-VP3patch2, p35S-NTAP-VP3patch1+2 and p35S-NTAP a PPV full-length cDNA clone derived from pICPPV-NK-GFP was used as control. the accuracy of all the constructs was verified by restriction digestion analysis. the accuracy of all the constructs was verified by restriction digestion analysis. gel filtration analysis Affinity-purified 6xHis-tagged VP3s were analyzed by gel filtration using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (KTA FPLC, Pharmacia) using a superdex-200 5/150 column (Pharmacia) previously calibrated with catalase (158 kDa), serum albumin (68 kDa), ovoalbumine (50 kDa) and chymotrypsinogen A (21 5% polyacrylamide-containing 0.5Tris-borate-EDTA gels and 1% agarose-containing 0.5Tris-borate-EDTA gels were resolved. polyacrylamide gels were dried and exposed to X-ray sensitive films. the immunostained proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminiscence detection with a LifeABlot kit (Euroclone) all plants were grown in a greenhouse maintained at 16 hours light with supplementary illumination and a temperature range of 19\u201323\u00b0C. the generation of the rBV expressing a 6 His-tagged version of rBV hisVP3Patch2 mutant (rBV hisVP3Patch2) was performed using the approach described above. the construction of rBVs expressing the VP3 from DXV and IPNV was performed as follows. expression vectors producing untagged CVYV P1b (pMDC32-P1b), untagged and TAP-tagged Influenza NS1 (pMDC32-NS1 and p35S-NTAP-NS1) were constructed by LR clonase reactions between the corresponding pDONR entry vectors and either the destination vectors pMDC32 or pNTAPi. a PPV full-length cDNA clone derived from pICPPV-NK-GFP was used as control. the accuracy of all the constructs was verified by restriction digestion analysis. the accuracy of all the constructs was verified by restriction digestion analysis. gel filtration analysis Affinity-purified 6xHis-tagged VP3s were analyzed by gel filtration using a fast protein liquid chromatography system (KTA FPLC, Pharmacia) using a superdex-200 5/150 column (Pharmacia) previously calibrated with catalase (158 kDa), serum albumin (68 kDa), ovoalbumine (50 kDa) and chymotrypsinogen A (21 5% polyacrylamide-containing 0.5Tris-borate-EDTA gels and 1% agarose-containing 0.5Tris-borate-EDTA gels were resolved. polyacrylamide gels were dried and exposed under UV light. each cartridge was shot twice onto two leaves of each plant. the immunostained proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminiscence detection with a LifeABlot kit (Euroclone) the immunostained proteins were visualized by enhanced chemiluminiscence detection with a LifeABlot kit (Euroclone)"}
