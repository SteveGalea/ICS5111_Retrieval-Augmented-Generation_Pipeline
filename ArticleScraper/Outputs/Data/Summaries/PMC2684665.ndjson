{"summary": "human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most common cause of acute respiratory tract illness globally [1], infecting both upper and lower respiratory tract tissues [2,3] they cause more asthma [4-6] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [7] exacerbations than any other factor identified to date. a quarter of children worldwide experience asthma symptoms, with prevalence plateauing in some countries while rising in other parts of the world. PCR-based methods have identified the frequent occurrence of co-detections in respiratory specimens. previous concept-defining HRV-related epidemiology was conducted without knowledge of the numerous co-circulating respiratory viruses discovered since. many of the 20th century's conclusions about HRVs will need to be revisited using modern methods. complete set of 1D regions was available in 2004 [34], including one common to both studies [36]. all these data have provided tools to expand our knowledge of the phylogeny, evolution and epidemiology of HRVs and to predict their drug susceptibility. a previously identified (HRV A' [40] clade within the HRV A species may represent a new species of HRV [20], as has been noted. the international committee on taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) set 70% amino acid identity in two key regions as part of the demarcation between species within the genus Enterovirus. the clade remains similar enough to the other HRV A strains in the P1 region (>70% average identity), its choice to address these areas, future respiratory virus studies should undertake an all-inclusive approach towards virus characterization. large populations should be screened regularly regardless of symptoms. many novel HRV strains are found when HRV-positive respiratory specimens are typed using subgenomic regions [24,26] sequences were aligned using Geneious Pro v4.6.1. the circular neighbor-joining tree was produced using CVA-21 (pink) only sequences included in the report are labeled. an agreed upon definition of what constitutes a distinct HRV strain would be helpful for future studies and may become available from the Picornaviridae Study Group in due course. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' information IMM leads a research team, including KEA. the authors' research is funded by the national health and medical research council (grant number 455905) and Royal Children's Hospital Foundation (grant number 10281)."}
