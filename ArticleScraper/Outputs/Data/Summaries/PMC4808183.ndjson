{"summary": "influenza virus infections account for 3 to 5 million cases of respiratory disease yearly, of which 250,000 to 500,000 cases are fatal. the disease is most severe in children under 2 years old, elderly, and individuals with an underlying disease (2, 3). vaccination is considered to be the most effective method for prevention of severe influenza illness (4), though it also has its drawbacks. hemagglutinin (HA) is responsible for binding of the virus to the receptor and virus entry into susceptible cells. fludase (recombinant protein with neuraminidase-like activity) cleaves off the sialic acid from the cell surface and makes the cells nonpenetrable to influenza virus (14). carrageenan is currently approved and marketed in some countries as an anti-inhibition. poly(allylamine

ELISA-based fetuin binding assay (FBA) showed that there was no difference in HA binding by fetuin in samples treated with NSPAH-65-89 and samples not treated with NSPAH-65-89. this indicated that NSPAH-65-89 does not inhibit interaction between the viral HA protein and the cellular receptor. the experiment with the intact virus was carried out. quantitative RT-PCR analysis of culture supernatants collected on day 2 p.i. no difference in CPE development relative to the control sample was observed. in quantitative RT-PCR, only a slight decrease (2 log units) in virus yield was found. the polymer solutions were applied to the cells at room temperature. cells were briefly rinsed with pH 3.0 buffer solution. cells were rinsed three times with sterile PBS (pH 7.4) and fresh medium was applied. all assays were performed in quadruplicate. the detection limit was 1,000 copies/ml. emergence of CPE was evaluated daily. the results were confirmed using amplex red neuraminidase assay in order to compare NA activity in the presence and absence of the tested polymers. we also examined whether the aggregation of virus on the virus-infected cells was seen in the presence of NSPAH-65-89 and -car by electron microscopic experiment. values below detection limit (1,000 copies/ml) are indicated by hatched bars. all assays were performed in quadruplicate, and average values with standard deviations are presented. unmodified PAHs (PAH-15-0 and PAH-65-0) were included as negative controls. inclusion of unmodified chitosan was not possible, due to its poor solubility under the experimental conditions. the bands, located between 1,180 and 1,140 cm1, can be attributed to a stretching vibration of the -SO2-N- group. the bands that appeared in the range of 1,210 to 1,150 cm1, 1,060 to 1,030 cm1, and at 650 cm1 can be assigned to a stretching vibration of \u2013SO2\u2013 in \u2013SO3H or \u2013SO3 groups. two assays were applied using influenza A/H3N2/EVA virus. the first was the microscopic evaluation of the cytopathic effect. 3N2/EVA activity and cytotoxicity of the polymers tested polymer antiviral activity (g/ml)c Selectivity index (CC50[XTT]/IC50)c IC MDCK (CPE)a IC50 MDCK (qRT-PCR)b CC50 (XTT)d CC50 (NRU)e PA-15-0 \u2014 56.3 2.6 49.5 2.7 \u2014 PA-65-0 \u2014 93.3 1.7 65.5 2.2 \u2014 NSPAH asterisks indicate that -carrageenan and -carrageenan at a concentration of 5,000 mg/ml form viscous gels. morphology of the MDCK cells was unchanged. d Compound concentration required to inhibit cell growth by 50% assessed by neutral red uptake (NRU) assay. inhibition of influenza A/H3N2/EVA replication in MDCK cells by -carrageenan (-car), -carrageenan (-car), Gelcarin ME 3054 (G-ME), and Viscarin SD 389 (V-SD) data are presented as log removal values (LRVs), which are normalized to the values for control samples (no polymer added). values that are significantly different (P 0.05) from the value for the control sample are indicated by an the experiments were conducted using NSPAHs showing the highest inhibitory activity against A/H3N2/EVA virus, i.e., NSPAH56-98 and NSPAH-65-89. results show that both polymers can inhibit replication of all studied viruses. CC50 values equal to 56.3 2.6 g/ml (XTT assay) or 49.5 2.7 g/ml (NRU assay) for PAH-15-0 and 93.3 1.7 g/ml (NRU assay) for PAH-15-0 and 93.3 1.7 g/ml (XTT) for PAH-65-0 showed relatively high cytotoxicity. an ex vivo culture model of fully differentiated respiratory epithelium was used to verify the data obtained. this multilayered, ciliated model morphologically, structurally, and functionally mimics human respiratory epithelium. these cultures allow infection and replication of several respiratory viruses, including influenza A viruses (27, 28). visual inspection of the HAE culture showed that in the presence of the polymer, no CPE development could be spotted. data on virus replication are presented as log removal values (LRVs) which are normalized to the values for control samples (no polymer added) polymers interact with receptors on the cell surface, making them inaccessible to virions. the polymers interfere with virus internalization and nuclear translocation. the polymers interfere with virus replication, release, or other postentry steps. fetuin is a blood glycoprotein mimicking receptors on the surface of the host cells to which viral surface glycoprotein (hemagglutinin [HA]) may attach. the results of the FBA showed that there was no difference in HA binding by fetuin in samples treated with NSPAH-65-89 and samples not treated with NSPAH-65-89. similar results were obtained for -car, suggesting that it has a different mechanism of action than previously development relative to the control sample was observed. in quantitative RT-PCR, only a slight decrease (2 log units) in virus yield was found. the polymers do not interfere with the influenza virus interaction with its receptor. cells were rinsed three times with sterile PBS (pH 7.4) and fresh medium (0% DMEM) was applied. inhibition of virus replication should be observable for compounds blocking endocytosis; indeed, in samples in which we blocked endocytosis, vast inhibition of virus replication was observed. the inhibition of replication/release of virions was tested. the results of this experiment indicate that the studied polymers inhibited influenza A/H3N2/EVA virus replication. the results obtained (Fig. S10) indicated that NSPAH-65-89 and -car decreased the NA activity by only about 20% compared to the value for the control sample. we also examined whether the aggregation of virus on the virus-infected cells was seen in the presence of NSPAH-65-89 and -car by electron microscopic experiment.
