{"summary": "over 14,620 individuals develop B-CLL annually, there are circa 4,650 deaths 3 and no curative therapies. treatment with such agents is invariably associated with side effects that range from mild to severe, and eventual emergence of drug resistance. the IGHV1-69 germline gene was among the first of the genes shown to be overrepresented in B-CLL patients with unmutated IGHV genes. a high proportion of IGHV-unmutated B-CLL cases often carry complementarity-determining region (CDR) 3 stereotyped rearrangements. GHV1-69 germline gene differ by 3 residues in CDR-H2 and one residue in framework (FRW)-H3.29 MuG6 preferentially recognizes antibodies encoded by IGHV1-69 51p1 alleles that are expressed in their germline configuration. since circa 6.160.55 of the circulating IGH repertoire from healthy individuals express IGHV1-69 BCRs, an anti-cancer reagent that targets this B cell subset will not lead to global B cell mice were stained for human CD45+ mononuclear cells at 16 weeks post immune reconstruction to verify levels of engraftment. mice were then randomly assigned into different groups and treated with muG6 or control antibody. serum muG6 levels at days 7, 9 and 10 were 12.4, 7.2 and 5.4 ng/ml. GTL mice were injected with muG6, control mouse IgG. the percentage of human B cells in the total human lymphocytes was analyzed via flow cytometry. muG6 was compared with other humanized or human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) including 5c8 (anti-CD40L), Fab 7G10 (anti-IL23), hATR-5 (anti-Tissue factor), 1C12 (anti-musk odorant traseolide), and a mouse Fab 64M-2 (anti-DNA t(6-4) T photoproduct. further analysis in the structure revealed one steric clash with Val89 (CDR- humanized variable heavy (VH) and variable light kappa (VK) domains are marked in black rectangles. one residue is changed (VH-Threonine73 to Lysine73) between HuG6.1 and HuG6.3. residues that caused steric clashes were back mutated to the mouse counterpart. in summary, four identified residues were mutated back to the original mouse residues. the sequence alignment highlighted differences in muG6 with different versions of HuG6. the residues with steric clashes are identified in the humanized G6.1 structural homology model. the residues with steric clashes are identified in the humanized G6.1 structural homology model. the binding affinities of muG6 and HuG6s scFv-Fcs were synthesized and codon-optimized for mammalian cell expression. muG6, HuG6.2, and HuG6.3 scFv-Fcs binding to immobilized D80 scFv were 0.35, 0.23, and 0.16 nM respectively. a residue difference between Thr73 and Thr73 influenced the binding affinity, suggesting a definitive role of lysine in modulating the binding pattern. antibodies with unmutated VH segments three IGHV1-69 encoding scFvs (D80, F43, and F70) and one control IGHV1-18 encoding scFv (S37) were investigated the binding affinity to HuG6.3 using Meso Scale Discovery (MSD) immunoassay. to mimic G6-id+ B-CLL cells, we used IGHV1-69 encoding D80, F70, and F43 scFvs. to anchor surface-expressed G6-id+ scFv to the cell membrane, scFv-Fc proteins were fused to a transmembrane moiety. anti-human Fc IgG2a showed 25% killing activity among all transduced cells. a mouse anti-human Fc IgG2a was used in the ADCC assay. a mouse anti-human Fc IgG2a was used in the ADCC assay. effector cells were incubated with PBMCs at the ratio of 25 (effector (E) cells to 1 (target (T) cells) in panel (E) IGHV1-69 G6-id+ B cell from CLL patients were used as target (T) cells. antibodies over a concentration range of 0.2 to 20 g/mL were tested. HuG6.3-mediated killing of G6-id+ and G6-id B-CLL cells was performed in vivo and in vivo. in vivo, we generated a double mutant (L234A, L235A) HuG6.3 (mHuG6.3, that did not bind either FcR or C1q) for in vivo examination. the peripheral blood from GTL mice was stained for human CD45+ mononuclear cells at 16 weeks post immune reconstruction to verify levels of engraftment. mice were randomly assigned into different groups and treated with muG6 or control antibody. serum muG6 levels at days 7, 9 and 10 were 12.4, 7.2 and 5.4 ng/ml. plasma demonstrate that MuG6 has the capacity to deplete IGHV1-69 G6-id+ B cells in vivo. the in vivo function of MuG6 in the humanized GTL mice model. the best-matched human Ig germline VH and VL sequences were IGHV1-46*13 (68.4% homology to MuG6-VH) and IGKV1-16*01 (67.4% homology to MuG6-VL) muG6 was compared with other humanized or human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) muG6 and HuG6.1 are shown in Fig. 2, with 18 and 18 amino acids mutations in the VH and VL. there are 18 mutations in the heavy chain and 18 mutations in light chain between HuG6.1 and muG6.1. Lys73 (FRW-H3) with Gly54 (CDR-H2), Met4 (FRW-L1) with Cys88 (FRW-L3), Tyr36 (FRW-L2) with Cys88 (FRW-L3), and Gln79 (FRW-L3) with Arg61 (FRW-L3) residues that caused steric clashes were back mutated to the mouse counterpart. residues with steric clashes are identified in the humanized G6.1 structural homology model. residues with steric clashes, bad field problems, and buried side chain with no hydrogen bonds are colored in red, yellow, and orange. acore interrogates binding kinetics of muG6 and HuG6s scFv-Fcs against D80 scFv. the KD of muG6, HuG6.2, and HuG6.3 against scFv-Fcs were 0.35, 0.23, and 0.16 nM respectively. these results were consistent with the apparent higher affinity of HuG6.2 and HuG6.3 over MuG6 by ELISA. HuG6.3 binds with higher affinity to two IGHV1-69 antibodies. three IGHV1-69 encoding scFvs (D80, F43, and F70) and one control IGHV1-18 encoding scFv (S37) were investigated. there was no reactivity of HuG6.3 to S37 scFv. IGHV1-69 and non-IGHV1-69 transduced 293T cells were used as the target cells for CDC and ADCC assays. the scFv-Fcs were further evaluated for their capacity to mediate CDC activity on the G6-id+ 293T cells using rabbit serum. the specificity of the CDC-mediated killing was shown by the lack of cytotoxicity on negative control G6-id 11A-293T cells. a mouse anti-human Fc IgG2a was used in the ADCC assay. a mouse anti-human Fc IgG2a was used in the ADCC assay. MuG6 and HuG6.3 induce specific ADCC activities against IGHV1-69 G6-id+ cells compared with control antibody. freshly isolated human PBMC cells were used as the effector cells in the ADCC assay. the results showed that both muG6 and HuG6.3 could mediate ADCC in a dose-dependent manner. a double mutant (L234A, L235A) HuG6.3 (mHuG6.3, that did not bind either FcR or C1q) was generated for in vivo examination. humanization of muG6 was achieved using an in silico modeling approach combined with structure aided antibody design. two versions of humanized G6 resulted in improved binding affinities compared to parental MuG6. humanized antibodies HuG6.2 and HuG6.3 showed increased binding affinity (1.5\u20132 folds) and slower off rates. the 100% IGHV1-69-encoding F43 scFv-Fc has exhibited more than 10-fold higher affinity to HuG6.3 compared to D80 scFv-Fc (89% IGHV-encoding immunoglobulin) the mechanism(s) of anti-idiotype depletion in this mouse model is presumably mediated through ADCC by mouse myeloid cells. in addition, while complement component C5a is also defective,50 some level of CDC may still occur that could lead to depletion of G6-id+ B cells. this early time point was chosen for several reasons, including the limited number of B-CLL cells that were injected into the mice. the use of anti-idiotypic mAbs as anti-cancer agents is not a new concept. the use of anti-idiotypic mAbs as anti-cancer agents is not a new concept. the use of anti-idiotypic mAbs as anti-cancer agents is not a new concept. disorders involving pathophysiologic B-cell clonal expansion, including idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, mixed cryoglobulinemia, and hepatitis C virus-induced B cell clonal disorder,61-64. a broader range of therapeutic applications for this humanized anti-idiotypic mAb should be investigated. antibodies (scFv-Fc and IgG1) were produced in 293F cells. muG6 was harvested from the supernatant of MuG6 hybridoma. all antibodies were further purified by protein A sepharose affinity chromatography. all engrafted mice were housed under Biosafety Level-2 conditions. the levels of human immune reconstitution were measured by flow cytometry.
