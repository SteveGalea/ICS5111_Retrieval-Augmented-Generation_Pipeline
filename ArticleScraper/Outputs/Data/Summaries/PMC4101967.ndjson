{"summary": "the PRRS virus (PRRSV) is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus. it is grouped into two genotypes: european (Type 1) and North American (Type 2). the genome of PRRSV is about 15 kb in length with 10 open reading frames. some of the PRRSV proteins take part in the modulation of IFN-mediated immune response. interferons are major components of inmate immunity and have diverse biological functions including antiviral activity. a few relevant reviews on PRRSV interplay with innate immunity were published previously. this review is arranged into sections of IFN induction, IFN-activated signaling, IFN-stimulated genes, and perspective. at least 39 functional type I IFN genes have been identified. PRRSV is sensitive to type I IFNs and the sensitivity is confirmed in vitro and in vivo. pretreatment of MARC-145 cells and porcine pulmonary alveolar macrophages with porcine IFN- inhibited PRRSV replication. PRRSV fails to induce porcine pDCs to produce IFN-. pseudorabies virus (PrV), swine influenza virus (SIV) and TGEV stimulated pDCs to synthesize IFN-. presence of PRRSV markedly reduced the typical IFN- response of pDCs to TGEV or Toll-like receptor 9 agonist. PRRSV nsp1 inhibits IRF3 association with CBP, enhances CBP degradation, and interferes with IB degradation. nsp2 inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation via degrading IPS-1 mRNA. nsp1 is self-cleaved into nsp1 and nsp1 subunits, both of which localize in the cell nucleus. nsp1 and nsp1 inhibited the activation of IFN- promoter (p125-Luc) and an artificial promoter containing three IRF3 binding sites (p55-CIB-Luc) beura et al. showed that nsp1 interfered with IRF3 signaling pathway by inhibiting dsRNA-induced IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. the discrepancy is possibly because an nsp1 that is 27-residue longer than its authentic form was used in Beura's study. recombinant viruses with nsp1 mutations by reverse genetics induced higher level gene expression of type I IFNs. nsp2 inhibits IFN induction by blocking IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. nsp11 suppressed the activation of IFN- promoter and the expression of IRF3-mediated genes. the inhibition of IRF3 phosphorylation is due to the nsp11 endoribonuclease activity, which can cleave mRNA of IPS-1 [15], the adaptor molecule for RIG-I and MDA-5. the nsp11 endoribonuclease activity is not restricted to nonstructural proteins of PRRSV. the suppressive effect on pDC may be strain dependent. a novel isolate, A2MC2, induced IFNs in both MARC-145 and PAM cells and virus replication was needed for IFN induction. signaling of type I IFNs is initiated after they bind to receptors on the cell surface. this receptor binding activates Janus kinases (JAK) which phosphorylates both signal transducers and activators of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2. phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2 form heterodimers followed by interaction with interferon regulatory factor 9 (IRF9). PRRSV infection of PAM cells also blocks JAK/STAT signaling. vaccine strain Ingelvac PRRS MLV had little effect, possible due to its less efficient replication in primary cells. IFN-/- binds to receptors IFNAR-1 and IFNAR-2 on cell membrane. nsp1 inhibits ISGF3 nuclear translocation via inducing degradation of KPNA1. other PRRSV proteins including nsp7, nsp12, GP3 and N were also found to be able to inhibit IFN-activated signaling. PRRSV inhibits synthesis of type I IFNs in pigs infected with type 1 strains. swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) induced high level of IFN-. PRRSV proteins that are found to be antagonists of IFN induction include nsp1, nsp2, nsp11, and N. nsp4, a 3C-like serine protease responsible for most of the nonstructural protein processing [37] was found to inhibit IFN- promoter activation in a reporter assay. further study is needed to elucidate the mechanism. nsp1 is self-cleaved into nsp1 and nsp1 subunits, both of which localize in the cell nucleus. nsp1 inhibited the activation of an artificial promoter containing three IRF3 binding sites (p55-CIB-Luc) after SV40 stimulation. nsp1 and nsp1 blocked the induction of IFN- at downstream of IRF3 activation but had no effect on the formation of the transcription enhanceosome on the IFN- promoter inside the nucleus. nsp1 inhibited IRF3 association with CREB-binding protein (CBP) in the nucleus. MARC-145 cells led to reduction of IRF3 protein level (unpublished data) nsp1 and nsp1 identified critical motifs of the proteins in inhibition of IFN induction. the zinc-finger domain in the C-terminus of nsp1 is critical for this protein to antagonize both IFN- induction and NF-B activation. the n-terminus of nsp2 belongs to the ovarian tumor (OTU) protease family. it inhibits type I IFN induction by interfering with the NF-B signaling pathway. nsp11 suppressed the activation of IFN- promoter and the expression of IRF3-mediated genes. PRRSV field isolates have variable suppressive effect on IFN- induction. suppression was found at posttranscriptional stage. PRRSV infection of dendritic cells induced the transcription of IFN-. nsp1 and nsp1 proteins should be able to inhibit IFN induction. the virus is able to replicate when the inoculum is at less than 0.1 MOI. the virus is able to replicate when the inoculum is at less than 0.1 MOI. PRRSV replication inhibits the IFN-activated JAK/STAT signal transduction and ISG expression in both MARC-145 and PAM cells. transcripts of ISG15, ISG56, and protein STAT2 were significantly reduced compared to mock-infected cells. nsp1 accumulated in cytoplasm in HEK293T cells with nsp1 expression. the degradation of karyopherin-alpha1 (KPNA1, also called importin-alpha5) was involved in the ubiquitin-proteasomal degradation of KPNA1. nsp1 has no effect on KPNA1 expression or IFN-mediated signaling. nsp1 from the six strains was cloned and all but MLV nsp1 inhibited IFN signaling when overexpressed. nsp1 from the six strains was cloned and all but MN184 blocked the IFN activation in PAMs. PRRSV nsp2 was shown to inhibit antiviral function of IFN-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) by the deubiquitinase activity of the OTU domain of nsp2. nsp2 is an antagonist for the antiviral activity of ISG15 by reducing ISG15 production and conjugation. PRRSV is able to inhibit the polyI:C-induced activation of PKR, as well as its downstream effector eIF2. it is not known if PRRSV interferes with other ISGs. it is not known if PRRSV interferes with other ISGs. high-pathogenic PRRSV induces high level IFN- but causes high mortality in pigs [64]."}
