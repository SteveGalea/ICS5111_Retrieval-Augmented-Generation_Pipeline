{"summary": "the cumulative number of confirmed human cases of H5N1 from 14 countries between November 2003 and July 2014 reached 667. in total, 47 individuals infected with H5N1 were identified in china. 30 (63.8%) succumbed to the H5N1 infection. influenza viruses are different, which causes them to vary in their responses to apoptosis (14,15) apoptosis induced by the H5N1 NS1 protein may vary in different cell lines. RNA was extracted from supernatants of infected cells for use as a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) template for amplifying the NS1 gene. pMD18-T-NS1 was subcloned into expression plasmid pXJ40-hemagglutinin (HA) using XhoI (D1094A) and KpnI (D1068A) sites to produce the recombinant plasmid pXJ40-HA-NS1. plasmids were amplified and purified using a high-purity plasmid purification kit. NCI-H1299 and NCI-H292 were transfected with pXJ40-HA-NS1 or control plasmids. cells were collected after 24 h, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and triedpsinized with 0.125% trypsin/EDTA solution. anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, BD556432; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody were used to probe the NCI-H1299 cellular morphology. 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1,000, D1306; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to the data were analyzed using BD CellQuestTM Pro software. the percentage cells with apoptosis per group were determined. the percentage cells with apoptosis per group was determined. a total of 7 l proteins with equivalent concentrations (1 g/l) were heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C in lysis buffer containing -mercaptoethanol, then resolved using 4\u201320% SDS-PAGE. proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 1% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline. the results shown are representative of 3independent experiments. all data were expressed as the mean standard deviation. statistical significance among groups was assessed using one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey test. pMD18-T-NS1 was subcloned into the expression plasmid pXJ40-hemagglutinin (HA) (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) using XhoI (D1094A) and KpnI (D1068A) to produce the recombinant plasmid pXJ40-HA-NS1. NCI-H1299 and NCI-H292 were transfected with pXJ40-HA-NS1 or control plasmids. after 4 h, lipofectamine 2000-DNA complexes were removed. DMEM medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with or without staurosporine. anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, BD556432; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody were used to probe the NCI-H1299 cellular morphology. 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1,000, D1306; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to the data were analyzed using BD CellQuestTM Pro software. the percentage cells with apoptosis per group were determined. the data were analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. a total of 7 l proteins with equivalent concentrations (1 g/l) were heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C in lysis buffer containing -mercaptoethanol, then resolved using 4\u201320% SDS-PAGE. the proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 1% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature. the results shown are representative of 3independent experiments. Statistical significance among groups was assessed using one-way analysis of variance and the Tukey test. P0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. pMD18-T-NS1 was subcloned into expression plasmid pXJ40-hemagglutinin (HA) (Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) using XhoI (D1094A) and KpnI (D1068A) to produce the recombinant plasmid pXJ40-HA-NS1. NCI-H1299 and NCI-H292 were transfected with pXJ40-HA-NS1 or control plasmids. after 4 h, lipofectamine 2000-DNA complexes were removed. DMEM medium was replaced with fresh DMEM with or without staurosporine. anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody (1:1,000, BD556432; BD Biosciences, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) and Alexa 555-conjugated secondary antibody were used to probe the NCI-H1299 cellular morphology. 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 1:1,000, D1306; Invitrogen; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.) was used to the data were analyzed using BD CellQuestTM Pro software. the percentage cells with apoptosis per group were determined. the data were analyzed using a BD FACSCalibur flow cytometer. the total protein concentration was determined using the bicinchoninic acid assay. a total of 7 l proteins with equivalent concentrations (1 g/l) were heated for 5 min at 100\u00b0C in lysis buffer containing -mercaptoethanol. the proteins were then transferred onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane and blocked with 1% powdered milk in Tris-buffered saline. pXJ40-HA-NS1 transfected cells were incubated with anti-HA serum and Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibody. pXJ40-HA-NS1 transfected cells were incubated with anti-cytochrome c monoclonal antibody. NS1 protein of H5N1 induced apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells. previously, expression of NS1 was sufficient to induce apoptosis with or without STS. cytotoxicity was detected using the MTT assay. NS1-transfected cells were 22.96% Annexin V+/PI and 2.62% Annexin V+/PI+. empty vector-transfected cells were 33.47% Annexin V+/PI and 8.16% Annexin V+/PI+. NS1 is associated with the apoptosis of NCI-H292 cells. the lower left quadrants represent apoptotic cells, which were negative for Annexin V and PI staining. NS1 together with STS induced the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol. it is known that cytochrome c release from the mitochondria is a signal for apoptosis. western blotting was performed to detect the expression of cytochrome c in mitochondrial pellets and supernatants. the majority of cytochrome c expressed in mitochondrial pellets was isolated from the cells transfected with empty vector or pXJ40-hemagglutinin-NS1. d pXJ40-NS1-HA includes the full-length NS gene cloned from influenza H5N1. the NS1 protein began to express 24 h following transfection. pXJ40-HA-NS1 transfected H1299 cells were incubated with anti-HA serum and Alexa 488 conjugated secondary antibody. the addition of STS significantly decreased the viability of the cells compared with NS1-transfected cells and STS-treated cells. the addition of STS significantly decreased the viability of the cells compared with NS1-transfected cells and STS-treated cells. NS1 is associated with the apoptosis of NCI-H292 cells. effect of apoptosis induced by NS1 protein may be enhanced by STS. it is known that cytochrome c release from the mitochondria to the cytosol is a signal for apoptosis. this implies the possibility of NS1 protein being associated with apoptosis by activating the intrinsic pathway through cytochrome c. western blotting was performed to corroborate the effect of mitochondria/cytochrome c on the intrinsic apoptosis pathway inducted by the NS1 protein. the majority of cytochrome c expressed in mitochondrial pellets was isolated from the cells transfected with empty vector. NS1 NS1 protein induced apoptosis in NCI-H292 cells. previous studies have revealed that the NS1 protein of H5N1 is able to induce apoptosis in human airway epithelial cells (17,18) NS1-transfected cells were 22.96% Annexin V+/PI and 2.62% Annexin V+/PI+. NS1-transfected cells were 43.35% Annexin V+/PI. empty vector-transfected cells were 33.47% Annexin V+/PI and 8.16% Annexin V+/PI+. NCI-H292 cells transfected with pXJ40-HA-NS1 treated with 0.025 nmol STS. lower left quadrants show intact viable cells, which were negative for Annexin V and PI staining. lower right quadrants represent apoptotic cells, which were positive for Annexin V and negative for PI. western blotting was performed to detect the expression of cytochrome c in mitochondrial pellets and supernatants. the majority of cytochrome c expressed in mitochondrial pellets was isolated from the cells transfected with empty vector. NS1 may trigger the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria. the NS1 protein of the H5N1 highly pathogenic avian influenza virus strain is associated with apoptosis through the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway. the NS1 protein together with STS was able to cause the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and the change of MMP. in the present study, the plasmid with the NS1 gene was transfected with Lipofectamine 2000. the transfecting efficiency was lower than the penetrating ability of STS. at this point, the capacity of inducing apoptosis of NS1 is weaker than STS."}
