{"summary": "the first transgenic Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rat colony was held at the University of Otago Animal Resource Unit. animals were housed under controlled conditions of temperature (approximately 21 \u00b0C) and light (12:12-h light:dark cycle), with food (Meat-free Rat and Mouse Diet, Irradiated, Specialty Feeds, Glen Forest, Western Australia, Australia) all Cyp1a1-Ren2 rats used for experiments were obtained from internal breeding stock and were housed in groups of 4 rats per cage. all experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Otago. standard pelleted rat chow was ground and blended to a fine powder. I3C was added to the powdered diet to produce final concentration (w/w) of 0.125%, 0.167%, and 0.25%. male rats from each group were euthanized by using halothane. male transgenic Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rats were maintained on either pelleted standard chow (Specialty Feeds) or pelleted standard chow with addition of 0.167% (w/w) I3C for 14 wk. all animals were housed under controlled conditions in groups of 4 and had free access to water and food. the first transgenic Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rat colony was held at the University of Otago Animal Resource Unit. animals were housed under controlled conditions of temperature (approximately 21 \u00b0C) and light (12:12-h light:dark cycle), with food (Meat-free Rat and Mouse Diet, Irradiated, Specialty Feeds, Glen Forest, Western Australia, Australia) all Cyp1a1-Ren2 rats used for experiments were obtained from internal breeding stock and were housed in groups of 4 rats per cage. all experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Otago. standard pelleted rat chow was ground and blended to a fine powder.

Female Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rats placed onto a diet containing 0.167% (w/w) I3C showed an initial delay in weight gain when compared with females on standard chow. male Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rats fed the highest dose (0.25% w/w I3C), failed to female and male Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rats maintained on the standard diet were shown to have a SBP of 111 7 mm Hg. female rats maintained on an I3C dose of 0.167% were recorded to have a mean SBP of 109 7mm Hg. male rats had an increase in SBP to 140 6 mm Hg, which was significantly (P > 0.01) higher than in normotensive males. male Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rats maintained on normal chow showed no increase in SBP over the 14 wk. after the initial 2 wk of dietary dosing with 0.167% (w/w) I3C, SBP rose to 159 10 mm Hg. hypertension in Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 transgenic rats can be induced at any chosen age or time, allowing tailoring of experimental design. this model permits dose-dependent titration of hypertension, which enables the investigation of a broad range of elevated blood pressures, from prehypertension to malignant hypertension. a later study30 showed a continued rise in mean arterial blood pressure up to 28 d after the commencement of I3C. this progression was far slower than that seen in the first 2 wk. the diet-manipulated animals showed no adverse phenotypic features related to their elevated blood pressure. a general rule is that if no visible signs of pregnancy are noted within 60 d from pairing or the birth of the previous litter, the breeding pair is considered nonproductive and is removed from the colony. this practice helps ensure peak breeding efficiency is sustained, expected reproductive characteristics of the strain are maintained, and breeders are assessed sufficiently to select appropriate replacement stock. despite all efforts to remove this lag period, it appears to be a strain characteristic of the transgenic Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rat. the development of transgenic Cyp1a1\u2013Ren2 rats19 has allowed increased control of the study of hypertension."}
