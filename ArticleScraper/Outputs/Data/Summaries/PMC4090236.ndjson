{"summary": "an epidemic model simulated influenza cases (injection) from the time of the injection. cluster-detection statistics were applied daily on paired background+injection (combined) and background-only time series. each CDA plotted the Detection Delay as function of FAR or Caseload. the increasingly rapid deployment of electronic medical records (EMR) [9] broadens the array of data that could be recruited for surveillance purposes [10], [11]. the tantalizing potential of EMR-based surveillance remains in the making [15]\u2013[18]. authentic counts of patients with possible ARI were identified by applying previously developed ARI case-detection algorithms (CDAs) to institutional databases derived from real historical EMR entries. ARI was defined as: positive respiratory virus culture/antigen OR any two of the following symptom, of no more than 7 days duration. a component (column 2) is included in the corresponding CDA. individual CDAs are numbered in the first row. the model included 30 contiguous ZIP codes centered on Baltimore, Maryland. the susceptible population has the size and age structure described for Baltimore in the 2000 census [22] the birth rate for each age-class was obtained from the United States Life Table Functions for the 1994 calendar year [23] the time to the first true-positive alarm (detection delay) is 19 days. a false positive alarm occurs at day 50, when the statistic originating from the background-only dataset exceeds threshold. a statistical outbreak detection method was applied in parallel to corresponding time series that included either background and epidemic cases. the EARS W2c statistic is expressed as where is the time series index, is the observed case count on that index day, and are respectively a 7-day moving sample mean. the method signaled when the value of the W2c statistic exceeded a given threshold. performance measures We computed three performance benchmarks at any given statistical alert threshold. ARI was defined as positive respiratory virus culture/antigen OR any two of the following symptom, of no more than 7 days duration: a) cough; b) fever or chills or night sweats; c) pleuritic chest pain; d) myalgia; e) sore throat; f) headache AND illness not attributable to a non-infectious etiology. 63 79 85 88 97 99 69 75 (57, 69) (74, 84) (83, 91) (94, 99) (96, 100) (64, 75) (70, 80) Specificity (%) 92 97 96 93 90 89 99 99 (91, 92) (96, 97) (95, 96) (92, 93) (89, 90) (98, 99) PPV (%) 13 31 25 18 16 14 the susceptible population has the size and age structure described for Baltimore in the 2000 Census [22]. age-specific death rates for each of the 20 demographic age-classes were derived from the United States Life Table Functions for the 1994 calendar year [23]. the birth rate for each age-class was obtained from Guyer et al. a false positive alarm occurs at day 50, when the statistic originating from the background-only dataset exceeds threshold. a true positive alarm was issued if the value of the computed statistic exceeded a set threshold in the Combined but not in the Background dataset. a prospective surveillance cycle was repeated 51 times, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week. is the observed case count on that index day, and are respectively a 7-day moving sample mean and a standard deviation. the method signaled when the value of the W2c statistic exceeded a given threshold. the components and single-case detection performance of the eight (8) ARI CDAs selected for the current studies are summarized in Table 1. CDA components included: a) provider-assigned ARI-related diagnostic codes (International Disease Classification, 9th Revision, Clinical Modification, ICD-9) either used by the original Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) bioSense surveillance system [20] or a code set previously adapted to the VA (VA ICD-9 codes) individual CDAs are numbered in the first row. a component (column 2) is included in the corresponding CDA. the model included 30 contiguous ZIP codes centered on Baltimore. the proportion of cases that would be present for medical evaluation at the VA Maryland Health Care system was adjusted to reflect the age, gender, and population estimates of Baltimore veterans. the same model-generated outbreak was used as a common signal for all of our surveillance simulations. simulated cases from the epidemic model were first discounted by the sensitivity of the ARI CDA before being injected into CDA-specific background time series. a true positive alarm was issued if the value of the computed statistic exceeded a set threshold in the Combined but not in the Background dataset. the 80-day cycle length was chosen because it ensured at least one true-positive alarm with each surveillance cycle. this prospective surveillance cycle was repeated 51 times, each time shifting the outbreak injection to a different week of the one-year evaluation period. corresponding Detection Delays, FARs and Caseloads were obtained for a range of statistical alert thresholds adjusted iteratively to focus on a FAR range felt to be of practical use for surveillance. results The activity monitoring operating characteristic (AMOC) curves [29], [30] illustrate the relationship between average delay at detecting the synthetic influenza epidemic and the FAR. effects of combining diagnostic codes with text analyses resulted in outbreak detection performance roughly on par with that of the VA-adapted set of ICD-9 codes. text analyses boosted both case-detection sensitivity to 97% and the area under the ROC curve. despite these performance gains, the [VA ICD-9 Codes OR text analysis of clinical note] case-detection approach worsened outbreak detection performance. a public health department willing to investigate false alerts that involved 200 cases/year would discover the influenza outbreak in 20 days with CDA 8 (Fig. 2, lower panel, yellow boxes) under our experimental conditions, a public health department willing to investigate false alerts would discover the influenza outbreak in 20 days with CDA 8 (Fig. 2, lower panel, yellow boxes) compared to 33 days with CDA 2. combining diagnostic codes with text analyses of clinical notes resulted in outbreak detection performance roughly on par with that of the VA-adapted set of ICD-9 codes. despite these performance gains, the [VA ICD-9 Codes OR text analysis of clinical note] case-detection approach worsened outbreak detection performance. a public health department willing to investigate false alerts that involved 200 cases/year would discover the influenza outbreak in 20 days with CDA 8 (Fig. 2, lower panel, yellow boxes), compared to 33 days with CDA 2 (Fig. 2, lower panel, black circles). a public health department willing to investigate false alerts that involved 200 cases/year would discover the influenza outbreak in 20 days with CDA 8 (Fig. 2, lower panel, yellow boxes). the CDAs were developed against a validated manual reference standard. they only included EMR data elements found to contribute to ARI detection. these data support our hypothesis that information harnessed from a comprehensive EMR can improve timeliness and efficiency of surveillance. information potentially useful to public health surveillance has long been extracted from the free text narrative of chief complaints [37]\u2013[41], laboratory or imaging reports [37], [38], [41]\u2013[44], hospital discharge summaries [45], [46] or outpatient clinical notes [47], [48]. to date, little is known about how information should be combined with structured data to accelerate outbreak detection. text analyses would indeed be expected to complement structured data differently for diseases that are not defined through symptoms only. Optimal EMR data integration may also depend on the characteristics of the epidemic, as well as on the nature and utilization of the EMR in other health care cultures.
