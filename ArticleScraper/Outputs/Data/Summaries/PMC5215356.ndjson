{"summary": "a short piece of the MERS-CoV genome was found in a sample from an Egyptian tomb bat. several studies have found live MERS-CoV, MERS-CoV RNA, and anti-MERS-CoV antibodies in camels in the Middle East and Africa (4\u20137). the spread of MERS-CoV from animal reservoirs to humans has been epidemiologically linked. researchers have developed several promising approaches for a MERS-CoV vaccine (13\u201315; for a review, see references 16\u201319); however, no vaccines have entered clinical trials or are yet approved for use in humans or other animals. rabies virus (RABV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) have been successfully used as EBOV vaccines. both approaches are close to clinical trials (RABV) or have already entered phase 2 clinical trials (VSV) RESULTS Construction of an attenuated RABV expressing the MERS-CoV spike protein. we chose to introduce the MERS-CoV S protein into the cBNSP333 vector. the cBNSP333 vector is derived from the attenuated RABV strain SAD-B19. BNSP333-S1-G contains the wild-type coding sequence of the spike protein of MERS-CoV. the chimeric protein contains the entire S1 domain fused to the C-terminal part of the RABV G glycoprotein. expression of full-length MERS-CoV S inhibits expression of the RABV G protein and reduces viral titers dramatically. monoclonal antibody directed against the S1 subunit revealed a smaller band of 120 to 130 kDa, which corresponds to the S1 subunit. at 48 h postinfection, we observed the typical double band of the RABV glycoprotein at around 70 kDa. but the expression level of G was much lower in cells infected with BNSP333-S than in cells infected with the parental RABV strain BNSP333. both proteins were readily detectable in cells infected with BNSP333-S. the parental virus BNSP333 gave rise to medium-sized foci of infected cells. infection with BNSP333-S resulted in mostly large clusters of fused cells. additional bands of the expected size for the MERS-CoV S protein (180 kDa) and the S1 subunit (110 to 120 kDa) were detectable in the BSNP333-S virion preparation. however, these bands were rather faint. new vaccine vector (BNSP333-S1) expressing the aa of MERS S fused to a truncated RABV glycoprotein. the chimeric MERS-CoV S1\u2013RABV G protein utilizes the original MERS-CoV endoplasmic reticulum translocation sequence. one-step growth curves showed that the new virus expressing only S1 grew to titers of roughly 108 focus-forming units (FFU)/ml analysis showed that vero cells infected with BNSP333-S1 coexpress RABV G and the S1-G chimera and do not form the multinucleated syncytia that we observed when cells were infected with BNSP333-S1. the control virus BNSP333 and the BNSP333-S1 virus preparations contained similar amounts of RA. we sedimented virions on a linear sucrose density gradient. most of the S1 signal peaked in fraction 17 at the same density as the RABV G, N, and P proteins. to provide further evidence, we performed immunogold labeling of vero E6 cells infected with BNSP333-S1. BNSP333-S1 is immunogenic in mice and protects against challenge with MERS-CoV. we immunized 4 groups of mice (5 mice per group) with 10 g of BNSP333-GP (group 1), 10 g of BNSP333-S1 (groups 2 and 3), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at days 0, 7 and 21 postinoculation. mice were immunized with BNSP333-S1 or mock (PBS)-immunized mice. serum dilutions were between 1:1,280 and 1:5,120. sera from BNSP333-S1-vaccinated mice neutralized MERS-CoV. no response above background levels was detected in unvaccinated mice. the RABV-MERS vaccine was tested using the adenovirus-hDPP4-transduced mouse model (50) all four groups of mice were transduced, and after 5 days, mice in groups 1, 2, and 4 were challenged intranasally (i.n.) with MERS-CoV at 1 105 PFU/mouse (strain Jordan-n3/2012) ERS-CoV recovered from lungs of immunized mice Group/immunization MERS-CoV challenge Titer of recovered MERS-CoVa Mean Standard deviation 1/FILORAB1 Yes 7.65 106 4.04 102 2/BNSP333-S1 Yes ND 3/BNSP333-S1 No ND 4/PBS Yes 7.65 106 2.09 102 a ND, not detected (the assay detection limit is 2.5 102 PFU/g of BNSP333-S contains a mutation in the glycoprotein gene that eliminates neurotropism of the parent RABV strain. the chimeric protein contains the entire S1 domain fused to the C-terminal part of the RABV G glycoprotein. expression of full-length MERS-CoV S inhibits expression of the RABV G protein and reduces viral titers dramatically. expression of full-length MERS-CoV S protein of 200 kDa was detected by Western blotting at 48 h postinfection with a monoclonal antibody directed against the S1 subunit. the antibody revealed a smaller band of 120 to 130 kDa, which corresponds to the S1 subunit. at 48 h postinfection, we observed the typical double band of the RABV glycoprotein at around 70 kDa. NP333-S revealed the presence of fused multinucleated cells. we purified virus particles from the supernatant of infected Vero cells. the particles were concentrated from the clarified cell culture supernatant by ultracentrifugation. several protein bands were detected for BNSP333-S virions. these bands corresponded in size to the RABV N, P, M, G, and L proteins. however, the virions collected from cells infected with BNSP333-S seemed to contain no RABV G protein. the chimeric MERS-CoV S1\u2013RABV G protein uses the original MERS-CoV endoplasmic reticulum translocation sequence. the new virus expressing only S1 grew to titers of roughly 108 focus-forming units (FFU)/ml, similar to those of the control virus BNSP333 on vero cells. no difference in the expression of the RABV glycoprotein was detected between cells infected with BNSP333-S1 and cells infected with the parent virus BNSP333. immunofluorescence analysis showed that vero cells infected with BNSP333-S1 coexpress RABV G and the S1-G chimera. antibodies specific for the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV S were absent in the control virus. both the control virus and the BNSP333-S1 virus preparations contained similar amounts of RABV G. we sedimented virions on a linear sucrose density gradient. most of the S1 signal peaked in fraction 17 at the same density as the RABV G, N, and P proteins. BNSP333-S1 is immunogenic in mice and protects against challenge with MERS-CoV. we immunized 4 groups of mice with 10 g of BNSP333-GP (group 1), 10 g of BNSP333-S1 (groups 2 and 3), or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at days 0, 7 and 21 postinoculation. RABV G-specific ELISA titers are known to predict protection against RABV challenge (47\u201349) the protective abilities of the MERS-CoV S-directed antibodies are unknown. we therefore performed VNA assays against MERS-CoV using sera collected on day 35 postimmunization from mice of all four groups. sera collected on day 35 were assayed in neutralization assays against MERS-CoV on vero E6 cells. the dilution at which 50% of the cells showed cytopathic effect was averaged across 5 mice and graphed as the geometric mean titer for each vaccination group described in the legend of Fig. 6.

DNA vaccines or recombinant MERS-CoV S protein-based vaccines are safest for immunocompromised individuals. DNA vaccines require relatively large amounts of DNA (e.g., 0.5 to 2 mg) and multiple inoculations in order to induce potent immune responses in mice and rhesus macaques. DNA vaccination followed by boosting with a recombinant protein is protective against MERS-CoV infection in rhesus macaques large virus stocks prepared in vero cells grown in serum-free Optipro medium (Invitrogen) supplemented with 5% (vol/vol) fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% (vol/vol) penicillin-streptomycin. monoclonal antibody against the MERS-CoV spike protein was purchased from Sinobiologicals. era was assembled from codon-optimized cDNA encoding amino acids 1 to 750 of the RABV SAD-B19 glycoprotein (GenScript) codons 18 to 750 of the spike protein gene were amplified by using overlap extension PCR. the PCR product was digested with BglII and NotI and cloned into the pDISPLAY vector. the protein content was measured by using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. beta-propiolactone (BPL) was added at a concentration of 0.05% (vol/vol) to inactivate the virus. 10 g of inactivated virus was inoculated into a flask seeded with BSR cells. purified virus particles were denatured in urea buffer (125 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 8 M urea, 4% SDS, 5% beta-mercaptoethanol, 0.02% bromophenol blue) at 95\u00b0C for 5 min. three micrograms of protein was resolved on a 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and then stained overnight with Sypro ruby (Lonza, Walkersville, MD) for total protein analysis. images were captured by using a FluorChem M charge-coupled-device (CCD) imaging system (ProteinSimple) a PageRuler prestained protein ladder (Thermo Scientific) was used for molecular weight determination. the cells were seeded onto coverslips and infected the following day with MERS S-expressing RABV or control RABV in Opti-MEM at 34\u00b0C for 1 h. brilliant blue FCF was added to the 65% (wt/vol) sucrose solution. the gradient was centrifuged for 2 h at 106,000 g in an SW32 rotor. 0.5-ml fractions were collected from the bottom of the tube. cells were washed with cellgro Complete medium (Mediatech, Inc., Manassas, VA) for 2 h at RT. cells were incubated with goat anti-rabbit 15-nm colloidal gold (EM Sciences) for 2 h. cells were washed again, incubated with goat anti-rabbit 15-nm colloidal gold (EM Sciences) for 2 h at RT. mice were housed in cages in groups of five, under controlled humidity, temperature, and light (12-h light/12-h dark cycles) conditions. ten mice were inoculated intramuscularly with 10 g of chemically inactivated BNSP333-S1-G particles. the plates were incubated overnight with 3-fold serial dilutions of mouse sera in PBS containing 0.5% (wt/vol) BSA. this followed by three wash cycles, incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. color development was stopped by the addition of 50 l of 3 M H2SO4 per well. data were analyzed using 4-parameter nonlinear regression. antibody against the MERS-CoV spike protein was purchased from Sinobiologicals. monoclonal antibody against RABV phosphoprotein was a kind gift of Daniel Blondel (CNRS, Gif-Y-Survette, France). full-length spike protein cDNA and fragments of S with C-terminal truncations were amplified from a wild-type cDNA clone provided by the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center Division of Global Emerging Infections Surveillance and Response System. primers were designed to include a BsiWI site at the 5\u2032 end and an SpeI site at the 3\u2032 end to allow insertion into BNSP333. the supernatant was collected at 3- to 4-day intervals and replaced with fresh serum-free medium. cells were centrifuged at low speed for 10 min to remove debris and filtered through 0.45-m polyethersulfone membrane filters (Nalgene) the filtered supernatant was then concentrated by tangential-flow filtration in modified polyethersulfone (mPES) hollow-fiber cartridges. s in T25 flasks were infected at an MOI of 5 for 1 h in Opti-MEM (invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the inoculum was then removed, the monolayers were washed three times with serum-free medium to remove unadsorbed virus. the medium was replaced with 5 ml DMEM containing 1% FCS. the blot was incubated for 1 h with the appropriate secondary antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP;
