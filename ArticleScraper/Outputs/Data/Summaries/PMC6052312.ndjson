{"summary": "coVs infect humans and a wide variety of animals, causing respiratory, enteric, hepatic, and neurological diseases with various severities. in 2008, the Coronavirus Study Group replaced the traditional groups 1, 2, and 3 CoVs with three genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus (4). their tendency for recombination and the inherently high mutation rates typical of RNA viruses may allow rapid adaptation to new hosts and ecological niche the number of known CoVs in birds is relatively small compared to that in bats. the number of known CoVs in birds is relatively small compared to that in bats. the number of known CoVs in birds is relatively small. the findings supported that deltacoronaviruses have the potential for avian-to-mammalian transmission and emergence in mammals. to test this hypothesis, we carried out a molecular epidemiology study in 1,356 mammals and birds in Dubai, The United Arab Emirates (UAE), in the Middle East. none of the 1,164 mammals tested were positive for CoV CoV (n) birds 192 8 (4.16) Black swan 1 0 Crowned crane 1 0 Eclectus parrot 1 0 Falcon 34 1. with gamma distributed rate variation and estimated proportion of invariable sites (GTR+G+I) bootstrap values were calculated from 1,000 trees. the scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions.

gene data set analyzed under the relaxed-clock model. abbreviations for the viruses are the same as those in Fig. 1. these three avian CoVs were found in fecal samples of bulbuls, thrushes, and munias in Hong Kong (31) in 2012, the ICTV approved the classification of these three avian CoVs as a novel genus, Deltacoronavirus, in the Coronaviridae family (4). six of them were from fecal samples from pigs in china, laos, Mexico, south Korea, Thailand, Vietnam, and the interspecies jumping events were observed in the deltacoronaviruses from falcons, houbara bustards, and pigeons. falcons, houbara bustards, and pigeons were likely a result of predator-and-prey relationships along the food chain. falcons, houbara bustards, and pigeons were likely a result of predator-and-prey relationships along the food chain. falcons are known predators of pigeons and houbara bustards. falcons are trained by Arabian falconers to hunt houbara bustards. the meat is sold at high prices despite banning such controversial practices. lecular studies will reveal if these three closely related deltacoronaviruses share a receptor in these three phylogenetically distant birds. recombination involving the S protein is likely a common phenomenon among deltacoronaviruses, which may facilitate interspecies transmission and adaptation to new animal hosts. this suggests that these mammalian deltacoronaviruses may have arisen from recombination events between SpCoV HKU17 and BuCoV HKU11 or related viruses. recombination is not uncommon in other CoVs and was found to be responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV (48\u201351) a total of 1,356 fecal samples from 1,164 mammals and 192 birds were tested. all samples were taken from the caudal tibial vein (vena metatarsalis plantaris superficialis) the RNA was eluted in 50 l of RNase-free water. the PCR products were gel purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen) both strands of the PCR products were sequenced twice with the ABI Prism 3130xl genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) the sequences were compared with known sequences of the RdRp genes of CoVs in the DDBJ/ENA/GenBank sequence databases. sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce final sequences of the viral genomes. the nucleotide sequences of the genomes and the deduced amino acid sequences of the ORFs were compared to those of other CoVs using ORFfinder. the best-fit substitution models were selected using PhyML with Smart Model Selection. tMRCA and the HPD regions at 95% were calculated. the trees were summarized in a target tree by the Tree Annotator program. the blot was cut into strips, and each separated strip was incubated with an individual serum sample, at a dilution of 1:1,000. antigen-antibody interaction was detected with an in-house-developed polyclonal guinea pig anti-falcon IgY antibody at a dilution of 1:2,000. all animal fecal samples were leftover specimens submitted to the central veterinary research laboratory in Dubai, UAE, for pathogen screening over a 24-month period (January 2013 to December 2014) a total of 1,356 fecal samples from 1,164 mammals and 192 birds were tested. the mixtures were amplified by 60 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 48\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination, and no false-positive result was observed in negative controls. cDNA was amplified with degenerate primers designed by multiple alignments of the genomes of other CoVs with complete genomes available. additional primers were designed from the results of the first and subsequent rounds of sequencing. the 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the SMARTer 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit. gene sequence data were selected for analyses under the substitution model GTR+G+I using an unrelaxed log-normally distributed (Ucld) relaxed molecular clock. the MCMC run was 5 107 steps long, with sampling every 1,000 steps. antigen-antibody interaction was detected with an in-house-developed polyclonal guinea pig anti-falcon IgY antibody (59) at a dilution
