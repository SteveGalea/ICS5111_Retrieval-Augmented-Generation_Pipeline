{"summary": "the study aimed to identify reference genes as internal controls for gene expression studies by RT-qPCR in azole-stimulated Candida glabrata. results The expression stability of 16 reference genes under fluconazole stress was evaluated using fold change and standard deviation computations with the hkgFinder tool. RT-qPCR is a highly sensitive, accurate, and fast technique that offers high-throughput and the ability to detect low-abundance mRNAs [6] and quantify mRNA copy number [7]. RT-qPCR has gained favor as it offers high-throughput and the ability to detect low-abundance mRNAs. a reference gene is subject to the same errors in cDNA preparation as the gene of interest, making it an excellent normalizing control. however, selection of an inappropriate reference gene can add large unpredictable error to the analysis. the ideal reference gene should have a stable RNA transcription level under different experimental conditions and be sufficiently abundant across different tissues and cell types. the suitability of ACT1 in studies of azole-inducible gene expression in C. glabrata has not been validated. we have been using ACT1 as the internal control for gene expression analysis by RT-qPCR in clinical isolates of C. glabrata. fluconazole was added to cultures of each strain at a final concentration of 200 g/ml, followed by continued incubation with shaking for 2 h. RNA isolation and reverse transcription Total RNA was extracted from C. glabrata logarithmic-phase cultures grown in YPD broth.

NormFinder software computes a different type of stability value (ig) based on the intragroup and intergroup variation of the expression data. RT-qPCR was used to measure the RNA transcription levels of 16 reference genes in C. glabrata cells following azole stimulation. the ribosomal RNA subunits RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25 were the most stable reference genes. the other 10 reference genes showed marked variation in response to fluconazole. the most prominent variation was found in the RNA transcription levels of SDHA, ACT1 and RPL13A. 16 CT Change = CT(ut) CT(t); ut, untreated; t, fluconazole-treated. 2-CT(t) indicates fold change in RNA transcription of a reference gene normalized to RDN5.8. a high CT(t) value indicates down-regulation of transcription. a negative CT(t) indicates up-regulation of a gene\u2019s transcription. the calculated CT(t) and 2-CT values of the 16 tested reference genes in drug-treated samples are given in Table 2. the next three best candidate reference genes were UBC13, PGK1 and UBC7. the best reference genes will have the smallest SD and smallest fold-change values. the geNorm analysis identified RDN18, RDN25, and RDN5.8 as the most stable genes. the geNorm program estimates the optimal number of reference genes that could be used in combination as an NF value. each NF was calculated as the geometric mean of the two most stable genes, then the pairwise variability V was computed between NFn and NFn + 1 for n = 2,..., 15. geNorm bestKeeper NormFinder hkgFinder Gene Mean M Gene r Gene Stability value Gene Fold change RDN18 0.042 UBC7 0.983 UBC7 0.425 RDN18 1.2 RDN25 0.050 UBC13 0.978 PGK1 0.459 RDN25 1.3 RDN5.8 0.055 PGK1 0.974 UBC13 0.460 RDN5.8 1.4 UBC13 0.357 RDN5.8 0.915 PPIA a decrease in the V value indicates a positive effect and means that the added gene should preferably be included for calculation of a reliable normalization factor. the NormFinder program graded candidate reference gene stability according to a stability value computed from the intragroup and intergroup expression variability. the best correlations between the reference genes and the bestKeeper index were obtained for UBC7, UBC13, and PGK1. the rankings of the top three and the last three reference genes identified by the bestKeeper program were the same as those generated by the NormFinder analysis. the comparative CT method is a relative quantitation of gene expression between a target gene and a reference gene. the slope of the resulting semi-log regression line was used as a general criterion for passing a validation experiment. the slope of the resulting semi-log regression line would be ;0.1, meaning the two CT versus log10 concentration curves are nearly parallel. 0.262 0.210 0.836 0.689 0.689 0.778 0.688 UBC7 0.015 0.051 0.012 0.062 0.096 0.077 0.052 0.044 0.066 0.048 UBC13 0.069 0.051 0.028 0.035 0 0.079 0.068 0.068 0.022 0.069. fluconazole appeared to down-regulate the expression of all three target genes in the five different C. glabrata strains. we compared the fluconazole-inducibled mRNA expression levels of four target genes (CDR1, P. glabrata) DR1, ERG4, and ERG10) were normalized to different reference genes (ACT1, PGK1, RDN5.8, and UBC13) individually and in pairs. differences in quantitation were detected according to the reference genes used. normalization against ACT1 resulted in relative expression levels of target genes that were substantially different from those normalized using other reference genes. RT-qPCR was used to measure the RNA transcription levels of 16 reference genes in C. glabrata cells following fluconazole treatment. the CT values of the reference genes were directly compared between the drug-treated (t) and untreated (ut) samples using the formula: CT Change = CT(ut) CT(t). subunits RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25 were the most stable reference genes, with CT Change values less than 0.5. UBC13, PGK1 and UBC7 were relatively stable with CT Change values of only around 1.5. the other 10 reference genes showed marked variation in response to fluconazole. 2-CT(t) for fluconazole-treated cells indicates fold change in RNA transcription of a reference gene normalized to RDN5.8. the stability ranking is based on the values of CT Change, CT(t) and 2-CT(t) of the reference genes in fluconazole-treated cells. the calculated CT(t) and 2-CT values of the 16 tested reference genes in drug-treated samples are given in Table 2. the RNA transcription of SDHA, ACT1 and RPL13A was highly regulated in C. glabrata cells. there was almost no regulation of RDN5.8, RDN18, and RDN25 RNA transcription. the geNorm software evaluates reference genes by their M-stability values. the best reference genes will have the smallest SD and smallest fold-change values. the best reference genes will have the smallest SD and smallest fold-change values. the geNorm program estimates the optimal number of reference genes that could be used in combination as an NF value. each NF was calculated as the geometric mean of the two most stable genes, then the pairwise variability V was computed between NFn and NFn + 1 for n = 2,..., 15. the second best choice of reference gene combination based on geNorm V was the top five most stable genes, i.e., RDN5.8, RDN18, RDN25, UBC13, 0.425 RDN18 1.2 RDN25 0.050 UBC13 0.978 PGK1 0.459 RDN25 1.3 RDN5.8 0.055 PGK1 0.974 UBC13 0.460 RDN5.8 1.4 UBC13 0.357 RDN5.8 0.915 PPIA 0.534 UBC13 2.5 PGK1 0.478 RDN25 0.908 RDN5.8 0.922 PGK1 2.9 UBC7 0.500 RDN18 the cutoff value for V, below which the inclusion of an additional reference gene does not result in a significant improvement of normalization, was set at 0.15. the combination of the two most stable reference genes is the best option and the combination of the five most stable reference genes is the second-best option for accurate normalization. the best correlations between each reference gene and the index were obtained for the top three and the last three reference genes identified. the comparative CT method is a relative quantitation of gene expression between a specific target gene and a reference gene. the efficiency of the target amplification and the efficiency of the reference (internal control) amplification must be approximately equal. resulting semi-log regression line was used as a general criterion for passing a validation experiment that passes. the absolute value of the slope of CT versus log10 input cDNA would be ;0.1, meaning the two CT versus log10 concentration curves are nearly parallel. the amplification efficiency of RDN18 was clearly different from that of the ten target genes. each value is the slope m of the line (Y = mx + b) of the validation experiment. the slope m = 0 indicates that the efficiencies of the two PCR reactions are equal. the slope m = 0 indicates that the efficiencies of the two PCR reactions are equal.

ACT1 expression was variable in response to fluconazole, but the three ribosomal RNAs remained unaffected and showed stable expression in azole-treated C. glabrata. thellin et al. and other groups have recommended the use of 18S or 28S rRNA as an internal control for mRNA quantification studies. however, our further validation experiments showed that slopes of CT versus log10 cDNA were sufficiently parallel between RDN5.8 and the target genes, but not between RDN18 or RDN25. previous studies have indicated the instability of GAPDH in mammalian systems. this study broadens the scope of this phenomenon to C. glabrata. PGK1 mRNA levels remained relatively stable, in contrast to the marked variation in GAPDH mRNA levels in C. glabrata cells. our validation experiments showed that the amplification efficiencies of these genes were approximately equal to those of the target genes. these results suggest that the choice of internal controls is highly specific to a particular experimental condition. this suggests that the choice of internal controls is highly specific to a particular experimental condition. some researchers also advocate the use of two or more reference genes. this is a robust method for providing accurate normalization. but it is not always possible to measure multiple reference genes because of limited sample availability and cost. this is the first identification and validation of RDN5.8, UBC13, and PGK1 as the most suitable and stably expressed reference genes among the 16 reference genes tested. we recommend the use of RDN5.8, UBC13, or PGK1 alone or the geometric mean of these genes as standards for normalization when analyzing differences in expression levels in C. glabrata. hkgFinder software is currently available as an R source script. it can be downloaded for free from the NIAID exon website. it requires installation of R 2.11 or higher on computers using the Microsoft Windows operating system. the qBase PLUS software currently requires Microsoft Windows XP or above or Apple Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) with Java 1.6 or later. support for Linux is also available, but no requirements are listed on the manufacturer\u2019s website. this research was supported by the Intramural Research Program of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institutes of Health."}
