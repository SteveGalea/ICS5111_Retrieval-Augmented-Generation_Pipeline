{"summary": "the AAV genome is approximately 5 kb in size and is packaged within an icosahedral capsid that facilitates viral entry into susceptible cells. rAAV vectors are limited by their small carrying capacity, but possess several attractive features that are advantageous for use as therapeutic reagents. each serotype has demonstrated a unique profile of tissue tropism that can be utilized to develop targeted therapies with enhanced tissue specificity. the rAAV genome is one of the simplest of viral gene therapy vectors. it contains only the transgene expression cassette flanked by non-coding viral inverted terminal repeats. rAAV does not efficiently trigger a strong, acute inflammatory response, resulting in inefficient activation of dendritic cells. dogs can suitably model the physics and challenges of vector delivery to large volumes of tissue. the immune response to rAAV in canines has been investigated in several studies. but canines used for research purposes are routinely vaccinated against several potential pathogens. CPV vaccination has the potential to cross-react with other members of the Parvovirus family, including AAV. it is important to consider the influence of CPV vaccine-related immunity on the rAAV-directed immune response in canines. CPV vaccination has the potential to stimulate production of antibodies that cross-react with rAAV. rAAV6 neutralization activity in CPV-vaccinated canines, pre- and post-rAAV6 injection. beagle pups (n = 3) were vaccinated against CPV prior to 7 weeks of age. serum neutralization activity was minimal prior to rAAV6 injection. western analysis of CPV vaccination and serum anti-rAAV activity in canines. serum isolated from CPV-vaccinated animals does not exhibit enhanced anti-rAAV6 activity in comparison to unvaccinated controls. significant differences exist between canine and murine immune systems. the mouse has been used extensively as a model system for the study of vaccination responses, autoimmunity, and other aspects of mammalian immunology. commonalities between the immune systems of both animals predict that the results regarding CPV-vaccination may also be applicable to the canine model. serum was collected 4 weeks prior to rAAV6 injection and neutralization activity was quantified (B) both vaccination schedules elicited a slight neutralizing antibody response that was detectable at 1:50 serum dilution (* indicates statistical significance compared to unvaccinated control, p 0.05). hPlAP expression (C) and vector genome number (D) in muscle lysates showed no significant difference between vaccinated and unvaccinated animals. CPV-vaccination did not significantly influence the neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6 injection (E) neutralization activity in the day 1 vaccination cohort was significantly lower compared to the day 5 cohort. animals in the day 1 cohort demonstrated a greater degree of individual variability in neutralization activity. transduction of skeletal muscle was not significantly impacted by early vaccination in either cohort. rAAV6-vaccinated mice responded positively to the first IM injection of rAAV6. but it was important to determine whether this permissive state would persist. both cohorts showed a strong neutralizing antibody response. neutralization activity remained high even at more dilute serum concentrations. CPV vaccination and anti-AAV activity in dogs canine parvovirus-vaccination has the potential to stimulate production of antibodies that cross-react with rAAV. rAAV6 transduction was dramatically reduced (B) hPLAP staining and hematoxylin and eosin staining. beagle pups (n = 3) were vaccinated against CPV prior to 7 weeks of age. serum neutralization activity was minimal prior to rAAV6 injection. Western analysis of CPV vaccination and serum anti-AAV activity in canines. serum from dogs before CPV vaccination (pre-parvo), before rAAV6 administration (post-parvo/pre-AAV), or after rAAV6 administration (post-AAV) were used as probes. CPV-vaccination and rAAV6 transduction in mice CPV-vaccines have been developed and marketed by multiple agencies. mice were vaccinated following two different regimens that represent those commonly employed in kennels. Regimen 1 utilized reagents that were equivalent to the vaccines administered to the above cohort of beagles. it consisted of a dose of Galaxy\u00ae PV, a modified live CPV vaccine, coupled with Intra trac\u00ae 3. vector was administered via IV injection (2 1012 vg) and IM injection (1 1010 vg) two injection methods were employed to ensure maximum presentation of rAAV6 capsids to monitoring immune cells in both interstitial and intravascular compartments. no significant cellular inflammatory response was observed in transduced muscle isolated from vaccinated or unvaccinated mice. rAAV6 vaccination in neonatal mice did not significantly influence the neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6 injection (E) a diminished cytotoxic T cell response and the presence of circulating maternal antibodies can result in impaired induction of memory cells. rAAV6 vaccine and neutralizing antibody response in neonatal mice. mice received two sequential injections of rAAV6 at 4 and 8 weeks. permissive immunity does not persist in rAAV6-vaccinated mice. rAAV6-vaccinated mice were given an additional IM injection of 1 1010 vg into the contralateral TA muscle. both cohorts showed a strong neutralizing antibody response that was significantly enhanced when compared to the response obtained from the first bleed. rAAV6-vaccinated mice did not remain permissive to repeat infection. rAAV2-mediated delivery of human Factor IX (hFIX) to either skeletal muscle or liver resulted in therapeutic levels of hFIX in a subset of patients. rAAV1-mediated delivery of -sarcoglycan, two out of three patients responded well to the treatment. an anti-capsid immune response led to local inflammation and clearance of the majority, but not all, transduced cells over a period of several weeks. an rAAV-directed immune response has also limited transgene expression in a canine model of 1-antitrypsin deficiency. antibody cross-reactivity has been demonstrated with closely related variants of AAV. it has been shown that T cell receptors are reactive to epitopes that are conserved between different serotypes. this suggests that a cell-mediated response may be more broadly reactive across a related group of viral vectors. the CPV vaccination regimen used in these studies was chosen to reflect the vaccination regimens routinely employed in large kennels within the united states. the regimens evaluated in this study are representative of the majority of vaccine components that are used by major manufacturers. however, subtle differences in vaccines and vaccination schedules could influence the immune response. repetitive administration of identical serotypes has been ineffective in the majority of cases due to the development of a significant humoral immune response to rAAV vectors. it has been speculated that early vaccination with rAAV could stimulate a tolerant response to vector in the immature immune system. neonatal IP injection of rAAV6 does not facilitate repetitive administration of vector beyond a single, repeat injection. the neutralizing antibody response to rAAV6 is minimal and does not appear to significantly enhance either the humoral or cellular response to rAAV6. microfluidizer (Microfluidics, Newton, MA, USA) was used for affinity purification on a HiTrap heparin column (Amersham, Piscataway, NJ, USA) vector was titered using HT-1080 cells as transduction targets.
