{"summary": "the most common pathogens causing influenza in humans are type A influenza viruses (seasonal H1N1, pandemic H1N1 and H3N2) and type B influenza viruses. conventional treatments against the disease include two classes of antivirals. most circulating influenza viruses show resistance to adamantanes. the fusion of viruses with host cellular endosomal membranes is a major event of the influenza infection cascade. v-ATPase activity is responsible for pumping protons into endosomal compartments. the knockdown of v-ATPase subunits has been shown to result in significant inhibition of influenza virus replications. novel v-ATPase inhibitor can inhibit lysosomal acidification in human osteoclasts and reduce v-ATPase expression in gastric adenocarcinoma cells. study aims to characterize the application of diphyllin as an antiviral for various influenza virus strains in two types of cell lines. DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 25 mM HEPES buffer, and 2 g/ml streptomycin. cells were overlaid with DMEM supplemented with 0.2% BSA, 25 mM HEPES buffer, and 2 g/ml TPCK-treated trypsin. all incubation and infection steps were carried out at 37 \u00b0C. diphyllin was twofold serially diluted in cell media and added to the cell monolayer. the final DMSO concentration was no more than 0.5% in all wells. after 3 days, the culture supernatant was removed and 100 l of DMSO was added to each well. fluorescence images were obtained and data was quantified on iCys Research Imaging Cytometer (Compucyte, Westwood, MA) using 488 nm excitation/532 nm emission filters for green fluorescence and 560 nm excitation/610 nm emission filters for red fluorescence. time-of-addition assay of diphyllin MDCK cells were seeded in a 12-well plate (200,000 cells/well) 1 day before cells were washed, overlaid with fresh media containing the same concentrations of diphyllin as in previous step. cells were fixed for fluorescence microscopy examination of GFP expression (Section 2.9), or lysed for real-time quantitative RT-PCR (Section 2.10) and Western blotting (Section 2.11) cell culture supernatant from test wells was harvested to determine virus titers. infected cells without any compound treatment assumed to represent 0% cell viability. normalized cell viability data were plotted against diphyllin concentrations. cells were harvested for NP expression analysis using Western blotting. e microplates (Corning) and GFP fluorescence intensity was quantified using an imaging cytometer (iCys) normalized data were plotted against diphyllin concentrations. real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed with qScriptTM One-Step SYBR Green qRT-PCR Kit (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, MD) using previously published primers that target the M1 gene of influenza A virus. Western blot analysis MDCK cells or A549 cells were lysed in SDS sample buffer (Invitrogen) and disrupted by sonication. protein blots were probed with influenza virus anti-NP antibody (culture supernatant from ATCC hybridoma clone No. H16-L10-4R5). p 0.05, p 0.01, p 0.001, and p 0.0001 were considered significant. for all three compounds, 10 mM primary stocks and 100 M working stocks were made in respective solvents. two reference influenza virus strains were purchased from ATCC. three human influenza virus isolates, A/San Diego/21/2008(H1N1), A/San Diego/61/2008(H1N1) and A/San Diego/1/2009(H1N1 pdm09) were used in this study. control cell wells (without diphyllin treatment) assumed to represent 100% cell viability. 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50, diphyllin concentration at which cellular viability was reduced to 50%) was obtained accordingly. NS1-GFP virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 was used to infect the cells. after a 1-h period of infection, all test cells were washed and overlaid with fresh media containing 2 M of diphyllin. after 24 h, the cells were washed and lysed to analyze viral nucleoprotein (NP) expression using Western blotting. cell cytopathic effect (CPE) inhibition assay was used to determine the IC50 of compounds. the concentration of compound showed 50% inhibition of virus-induced CPE against various influenza virus strains. fluorescence microscopy of influenza virus Cells grown in 96-well microplates (Corning) were treated with diphyllin or bafilomycin A1 and infected with NS1-GFP virus. cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole, dihydrochloride (DAPI, KPL), and imaged using the deltaVision deconvolution microscope system real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed with qScriptTM One-Step SYBR Green qRT-PCR Kit (Quanta BioSciences, Gaithersburg, MD) using previously published primers that target the M1 gene of influenza A virus (Ward et al., 2004) and canine -actin (Wang et al., 2011). the membranes were incubated in sheep anti-mouse IgG HRP conjugate (#NA931, Amersham) at a 1:3,000 dilution for another hour. the membranes were developed using ECL Plus Western blotting detection reagents kit (Amersham) diphyllin inhibits endosomal acidification in MDCK cells and A549 cells. an MTT assay was performed and cell viability was normalized to the value of untreated controls (100%). diphyllin inhibits endosomal acidification in MDCK cells and A549 cells. MDCK cells and A549 cells were incubated with bafilomycin A1 (0.2 M) or various concentrations of diphyllin (0.078, 0.312, 1.25 M) at 37 \u00b0C for 20 min. untreated cells (media only) were used as controls. pretreatment/treatment with diphyllin alters the cellular susceptibility to influenza virus and showed an antiviral activity against influenza virus. two M of diphyllin was added to MDCK cells at three different time points relative to NS1-GFP virus infection (MOI = 0.01) after a 1-h period of infection, all test cells were washed and incubated with fresh media containing 2 M of diphyllin and incubated for 24 h. diphyllin showed an antiviral activity against the GFP-expressing influenza virus. intracellular viral mRNA and protein expression were examined in absence or presence of diphyllin pretreatment with MDCK cells and A549 cells. imaging and quantification of GFP fluorescence based on fluorescence imaging can be used to evaluate the extent of virus entry and replication. the relative intensity from test wells demonstrated a dose-dependent decrease in the presence of diphyllin. diphyllin inhibited virus replication of avian influenza virus and dengue virus serotype 2. an H6N1 avian influenza virus duck isolate and a plaque-purified DENV2 strain were also tested. incubation with 2 M of diphyllin completely abrogated growth of avian influenza virus in MDCK cells. culture supernatant and cells were harvested to determine the virus titers. values are mean SD from three replicates. diphyllin demonstrated an antiviral effect against various types/subtypes of influenza virus strains. diphyllin treatment were used as controls (black bars) after a 1-h period of infection, cells were washed, overlaid with fresh media containing the same concentration of diphyllin as in previous step. the cell culture supernatant was harvested for HA tests. values are mean SD from three replicates. a combination of diphyllin (1000 or 500 nM) and oseltamivir (1000, 500 or 250 nM) resulted in enhanced viral NP reduction. a combination of diphyllin (1000, 500 or 250 nM) resulted in enhanced viral NP reduction. oseltamivir alone resulted in only 5.13% in cell viability. combined treatment with 125 nM of diphyllin showed a 3.88-fold increase in cell viability. increased dose of diphyllin from 125 to 250 nM further improved cell viability by 8-fold to 41.12%. diphyllin (500 or 250 nM) and amantadine (100, 50 or 25 nM) showed enhanced antiviral effect and cell protection. combination of diphyllin (250 or 125 nM) and amantadine (100, 50 or 25 nM) showed enhanced antiviral effect and cell protection. a standard MTT assay was used to determine the cytotoxicity of diphyllin. the CC50 of diphyllin were 3.48 0.17 and 24.01 0.45 M (mean SD) in MDCK cells and A549 cells. the addition of bafilomycin A1 (0.2 M) or diphyllin (0.078, 0.312, 1.25 M) showed decreased acidic endosomes and increased non-acidic endosomes in cells. diphyllin treatment resulted in a dose-dependent quenching of red fluorescence in cytoplasmic vesicles. 2 M of diphyllin was added to MDCK cells at three different time points relative to virus infection. treatment before, during, and after infection resulted in reduced mRNA level of viral matrix gene and reduced expression of viral NP in cells. cellular exposure to diphyllin prior to virus infection resulted in the maximal inhibition effect on viral replication based on Western blotting analysis. infected cells without diphyllin treatment were used as controls. cells were washed, overlaid with fresh media containing same concentrations of diphyllin as previous step. expression of intracellular viral NP and tubulin was detected by Western blotting. 0.5 M of diphyllin pretreatment to cells resulted in 50% reduction of viral mRNA transcription as compared to the untreated control. the supernatant of the MDCK cell culture pretreated with 1 or 0.5 M of diphyllin prior to virus infection revealed significantly lower HA titer as compared to those of the untreated control. infected cells without diphyllin treatment were used as controls. after a 1-h period of infection, cells were washed, overlaid with fresh media containing the same concentrations of diphyllin as in previous step. cells were pretreated with diphyllin 1 h prior to strain A/Duck/Yilan/2904/99(H6N1) infection at an MOI of 0.1. cells without diphyllin treatment were used as controls (black bars) after a 1-h period of infection, cells were washed, overlaid with fresh media containing the same concentration of diphyllin as in previous step. diphyllin treatment (0.125\u20131 M) resulted in an overall dose-dependent reduction of viral HA titer against all four influenza virus strains compared to untreated controls. results suggest that diphyllin possesses a broad-spectrum antiviral activity against multiple types/subtypes of influenza virus strains. 0.51 nM (mean SD) against the A/Aichi/68(H3N2) strain. a relatively higher IC50 was observed against the H1N1 pdm09 strain. the clinical isolate A/San Diego/21/2008(H1N1) was found to be sensitive to the diphyllin treatment with an IC50 of 372.8 8.17 nM. a combination of diphyllin (1000 or 500 nM) and oseltamivir (1000, 500 or 250 nM) resulted in enhanced viral NP reduction. oseltamivir alone resulted in only 5.13% in cell viability. cellular virus titers in supernatant were determined by an HA test. oseltamivir (25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.125 nM) was used in the absence or presence of diphyllin (250, 125 nM) infected MDCK cells. diphyllin (500, 250 nM) and amantadine (100, 50, 25 nM) were used individually or in combination in A/Aichi/2/68(H3N2) virus infected MDCK cells. cell viability between each diphyllin cooperatively treated group and the amantadine alone treated group was compared by two-way ANOVA followed by Dunnett\u2019s multiple comparisons test. many of the classical v-ATPase inhibitors have been previously evaluated for their antiviral activity against influenza viruses. the high toxicity of these compounds made them unsuitable for clinical applications. lhalamide and diphyllin fall into the class of benzolactones. saliphenylhalamide is a lactone of salicylic acid and diphyllin is a lactone of naphthoic acid. saliphenylhalamide contains a macrocyclic N-acyl enamine functional group. the most significant inhibitory effect was obtained through the pretreatment protocol. previous exposure to diphyllin altered susceptibility of cells to influenza virus by regulating the amount of acidified endosomes within the cells. a concurrent treatment with diphyllin upon virus replication might be a worthwhile alternative when a prophylaxis is not feasible. diphyllin possesses a host-targeting, strain-independent mechanism of inhibition. a combination of amantadine and oseltamivir showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on both the virus expression and the CPE protection. the combination of diphyllin and amantadine showed an enhanced inhibitory effect on both the virus expression and the CPE protection. cell-based assays had less advantages than the direct enzymatic measurement of NA for monitoring susceptibility to the NA inhibitors. in our experimental setting, we aimed to compare the combinatorial effect of diphyllin with the NA inhibitor, rather than measure the susceptibility of viruses to certain NA inhibitors. cellular susceptibility to influenza viruses by inhibiting endosomal acidification, which leads to abrogation of virus replication in cells. in vivo use of diphyllin awaits investigation using animal model."}
