{"summary": "mouse macrophages under pro-inflammatory conditions express immunoresponsive gene 1 (Irg1) [3,4] for the first time, we also demonstrated IRG1 expression and itaconic acid production in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)-derived macrophages. irg1 is a key component responsible for the production of mitochondrial ROS augmenting the bactericidal activity of macrophages. in zebrafish, irg1 is specifically expressed by macrophage-lineage cells and is cooperatively regulated by glucocorticoid and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. IRG1 is regulated by a complex transcriptional machinery responding to cellular environments and external stimuli. it is highly likely that it is regulated by a complex transcriptional machinery responding to cellular environments and external stimuli. it is important to unravel its transcriptional machinery to understand its role and expression under specific inflammatory conditions. putative transcriptional regulators of IRG1 were hypothesized from the resulting GRN and tested using siRNA-mediated gene silencing experiments in mouse and human macrophages. the murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line [27] was cultured in DMEM medium (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California) with 10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS), 0.1mg/mL streptomycin (Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Carl PBMCs were mixed with 200L of CD14 MicroBeads and incubated for 30min at 4\u00b0C on a rotating platform followed by magnetic separation using LS-column. PBMCs were plated at 4x106 cells per well in 6-well plates, 1x106 cells per well in 24-well plates, 2.5x105 cells per well in 96-well plates. RNA extraction, reverse transcription and real-time PCR Total RNA was purified from cultured cells using the Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 0.5 to 2g of total RNA using superScript III (Invitrogen) with 1L (50M)/reaction oligo(dT)20 as primer. four different siRNA sequences targeted each of murine Irf1 (siRNA Irf1, L-046743-01-0005), human IRF1 (siRNA IRF1, L-011704-00-0005) and the corresponding non-targeting control (siRNA NEG, D-001810-10-05) were designed by thermo Scientific Dharmacon. the cells were grown on cellCarrier 96 well plates (Perkin Elmer) the cells were permeabilized for 5min with 0.5% triton X-100 in PBS. permeabilization was followed by 3 x 10min washing steps in PBS. the minimum size of nuclei was set to 1000 pixels. for the detection of cell covered regions, the three channels were summed up and low pass filtered with a gaussian filter of size 50 and sigma 5. the lysate was shaken at 4\u00b0C for 20min at maximum speed. the supernatant was then centrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 5min at maximum speed. the extracted protein samples were then quantified using a Bradford assay. metabolite extraction Cells seeded in 6-well plates were washed with 1mL of saline solution (0.9% NaCl) and quenched with 0.4mL cold methanol. extracts were vortexed at 1400rpm for 20min at 4\u00b0C and centrifuged at 13500rpm for 5min at 4\u00b0C. chromatograph was equipped with a 30m Agilent J&W DB-35MS capillary column.

GeneChip Human Gene 1.0ST and GeneChip Mouse Gene 2.0ST Arrays (Affymetrix) were used to determine the genome-wide expression profiles of PBMCs-derived macrophages and RAW264.7 cells. total RNAs (250ng) were processed using the Affymetrix Whole Transcriptome (WT) expression kit according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. microarrays were hybridized, washed and stained using the Affymetrix GeneChip WT terminal MATCHTM algorithm searches for potential binding sites of TFs on any given genomic sequence using the position weight matrices library from TRANSFAC\u00ae database. each PWM consists of the nucleotides and their frequency at respective position on the binding sequence. text mining technology was used to scan all the PubMed abstracts (30 million) and relevant sentences were collected based on the manually curated dictionaries with the synonyms of biological terms. for this network, the extracted literature was restricted as follows: species: human/mouse; cell type: macrophages; interactions: direct regulations in the network building settings of the Pathway Studio software. ferred GRN were computed using the graph k shortest paths algorithm of Matlab. these paths provide the basis set of putative regulators and pathways for translating the signal to induce IRG1. the score ranges from 0 to 1 with 1 being the most essential gene and 0 being non-essential. p-values were calculated according to the Student t-test with the two-tailed distribution assuming two-sample equal variance. results show that IRG1 is expressed by different immune cells under various inflammatory conditions. RNA was extracted from (A) PBMCs-derived monocytes, (B) PBMCs-derived macrophages and (C) PBMCs-derived dendritic cells 6 hours after treatment with LPS (10g/ml), TNF (50ng/ml), IFN (10ng/ml) and LPS together with TNF or IFN in independent donors (D1-D6) the bars show the mean of 3 technical replicates of IRG1 mRNA levels cytoplasmic vesicular structures were analysed to quantify mitochondrial accumulation of IRG1/CAD. bars represent the median proportion of mitochondrial IRG1/CAD in untreated cells, LPS, IFN and LPS with IFN treated cells. the literature network downstream of LPS inferred from Pathway Studio resulted in a network of 1458 nodes and 2857 edges. as for the mouse analysis, these two networks were then merged with a total of 1490 nodes and 7092 edges. from these genes, we identified the top 100 DEGs between untreated and LPS-activated conditions. the classical pro-inflammatory-associated transcription factors are highly up-regulated in LPS conditions when compared to untreated cells. in human cells, 1051 genes were up-regulated in LPS conditions when compared to control. in mouse macrophages, a total of 564 genes were up-regulated and, among them, 28 were transcription factors. Irg1 has direct connections with the transcriptional regulators IRF1, PRDM1, CEBPD and STAT1. in the mouse network, Irg1 is directly connected to the transcriptional regulators IRF1, VDR, STAT4, RUNX1, RARA and ETS2 be predicted to have an inhibitory effect on IRG1 expression. the gene essentiality metric scores were calculated from the mouse and human simple paths networks. the total paths represent the number of paths in the simple paths networks from LPS to IRG1. the paths present after perturbation of transcriptional regulators is the number of paths where a specific regulator is not present. mouse macrophages were transfected with siRNA targeting IRF1 or with a non-targeting siRNA as control. after 24 hours of transfection, mouse cells were stimulated with LPS. after 2 hours of transfection, RNA was extracted after 2 hours. we first silenced Cebpb, our second top scoring transcriptional regulator. IRF1 and IRG1/CAD proteins were not detectable in control conditions. expression levels both decreased in Irf1 silenced cells as compared to non-targeting siRNA transfected cells following LPS stimulation. proteins were extracted from transfected cells after 4 hours of LPS stimulation. itaconic acid levels in Irf1 silenced cells were calculated as the percentage relative to non-specific transfected cells in (D) control and (E) LPS activated cells. Error bars and statistical significance were calculated from 3 biological replicates. PBMCs-derived macrophages were transfected with siRNA negative (siRNA NEG) or siRNA specific to IRF1 (siRNA IRF1) 24 hours before treatment. RNA was extracted 6 hours after activation with LPS (10g/ml) in independent donors. results show that IRF1 is a transcriptional regulator of IRG1 in both mouse and human macrophages. RG1 is expressed at the highest levels at 6\u20139 hours in both monocytes and macrophages. expression is already significantly induced after 40 minutes in human PBMCs-derived macrophages and after 20 minutes in the murine RAW264.7 macrophage cell line. results show that it is rapidly induced in both human and murine macrophages under inflammatory conditions. human IRG1/CAD is accumulating in mitochondria (Fig 3A and 3B) treatments with LPS alone or in combination with IFN caused significant mitochondrial accumulation of IRG1/CAD under pro-inflammatory conditions. the literature network downstream of LPS inferred from Pathway Studio resulted in a network of 615 nodes and 1278 edges. the merged network with 663 nodes and 5214 edges established the connection between LPS and Irg1 with common nodes from both networks. as for the mouse analysis, these two networks were then merged with a total of 1458 nodes and 2857 edges. gene ontology (GO) analysis reveals up-regulation of biological processes. down-regulated biological processes are related to cell cycle in mouse cells. in human macrophages they are associated to different metabolic processes. the interactions of LPS with the nodes of this contextualised networks were retrieved from the LPS downstream networks and added to the contextualised networks. the resultant signed and directed mouse network had 40 nodes and 70 edges. the human network had 33 nodes and 72 edges. cer binding protein (C/EBP) delta; STAT1, signal transducer and activator of transcription 1; JUNB, Jun B proto-oncogene; PRDM1, PR domain containing 1 with ZNF domain; STAT4, signal transducer and activator of transcription 4; FOS, FBJ murine osteosarcoma viral oncogene homolog 2; ETS2, v-ets avian erythroblastosis virus E26 oncogen the gene essentiality metric scores were calculated from the mouse and human simple paths networks. we were then interested to investigate the effect of the transcriptional regulator IRF1 on IRG1 expression. we were then interested to investigate the effect of the transcriptional regulator IRF1 on IRG1 expression. Irg1 expression was significantly decreased by 66% and 26% in Irf1 silenced cells as compared to non-targeting siRNA in unstimulated and LPS-treated cells. in parallel, proteins were extracted from the cells 4 hours after LPS stimulation. the bars show the mean of 3 biological replicates ( SEM) of (A) Irf1 and (B) Irg1 mRNA levels measured by real-time PCR normalised with L27 as the housekeeping gene. Western blot bands of IRF1, IRG1/CAD and -ACTIN proteins were extracted from transfected cells after 4h of LPS stimulation. we overlaid the putative top scoring IRF1 binding motifs identified in our MATCHTM analysis (S2 Table) results show that, in the human monocyte lineage, IRF1 binding sites in the IRG1 locus are associated with active chromatin marks. the bars show the mean of (A) IRF1 and (B) IRG1 mRNA levels of 3 technical replicates ( SEM) measured by real-time PCR normalised with L27 as the housekeeping gene. we demonstrated that silencing Irg1 in murine macrophages decreases itaconic acid levels resulting in a defective antimicrobial activity towards different bacterial infections. we also showed that IRG1/CAD plays an essential role in innate immune responses. we aimed to shed more light into its expression and transcriptional regulation under inflammatory conditions. some transcription factors are phosphorylated in order to be activated and shuttled into the nucleus to act as transcription factors. this could allow contextualizing the generated networks taking into account gene expression data, but also the phosphorylation data of various regulating proteins. our mouse and human analysis provide insights for the identification of species-specific regulators for IRG1 induction under LPS activation. IRF1 selectively regulates specific sets of genes depending on the cell type and the appropriate response needed to counter the external stimuli. some of the targets of IRF1 which are known to play a role in host defence are IFN, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), interleukin 12 (IL12), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) and IL15. iNOS promoter requires the dimeric binding of IRF1 for the full cytokine activation. iNOS promoter requires the dimeric binding of IRF1 for the full cytokine activation. other transcription factors, like NFB, may cooperate with IRF1 to induce the full transcriptional activity of iNOS. results show that IRF1 expression is highly up-regulated under LPS exposure. IRF1 silencing induces a significant decrease of IRG1 expression levels in both human and murine macrophages. it is already known that IRF1 has a significant role in antibacterial and antiviral responses. low levels of iNOS and NO in activated human cells [60\u201362] it was argued that these results neither show the functional pathway of NO production, as through L-arginine in mouse. iRF1 plays a crucial role in mediating antimicrobial responses through IRG1 gene regulation in human immune cells. RNA was extracted from PBMCs-derived macrophages at 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 120 minutes as well as at 3, 4 and 5 hours after treatment with LPS (10g/ml) the bars show the mean of 3 technical replicates ( SEM) of IRG1 mRNA levels measured by real-time PCR normalised with L27 as the housekeeping gene. heatmap shows top 100 differentially expressed genes (log2 FC1 and p-value 0.01) between control and 6 hours LPS-activated mouse RAW264.7 macrophages. individual biological replicates are shown as individual columns for control (n = 3) and LPS (n = 3). gene regulatory network (GRN) obtained after the contextualisation of the merged GRN (LPS downstream and IRG1 upstream) with the booleanised gene expression data of mouse RAW264.7 macrophages (LPS vs Control) the hierarchical layout of the network was created using CytoScape. expression data of human monocyte-derived macrophages was created using CytoScape. genes (nodes) in red are upregulated and in green are downregulated in LPS stimulated PBMCs-derived macrophages. interactions with solid lines are activations and the dashed line edges are inhibitions. top scoring putative IRF1 binding motifs identified in MATCHTM analysis overlaid with chromatin regions in the human IRG1 locus in PBMCs and blood CD14+ monocytes using publicly available ENCODE data on UCSC Genome Browser."}
