{"summary": "real-time PCR has become a leading technique for nucleic acid detection and quantification. this technique has the potential to greatly enhance clinical diagnostics. current primer/probe signature design strategies are limited. commercially distributed kits are available for PCR-based pathogen diagnostics. real-time PCR assays are limited by the quality of the primers and probes chosen. this software asks the user to upload a DNA sequence file and then finds possible primer/probe sets that meet the assay criteria. the literature was combed for recently published articles reporting real-time PCR assays for the clinical detection of bacterial and viral taxa. the primer and probe sequences were accumulated, with a preference for TaqMan assays. 3 intercalating dye assays were also selected. the forward/reverse primers may fall on either the plus or minus strand. the forward/reverse primers may fall on either the plus or minus strand. for each hit TaqSim calculates the melting temperatures as bound to the candidate hit sequence (accounting for mismatches) a l s e n e g a t i v e s t r u e n e g a t i v e s + f a l s e p o s i t i v e s p o s i t i v e s taxonomy node selection The primary research articles were read carefully a careful review of the Genbank entry was necessary to determine if the sequence of interest was truly a false negative. partial CDS's not documented to contain the target gene were eliminated from the false negative pool because it is possible the signature could land on gaps between the contigs. \"all_virus\" and \"all_bacteria\" databases were designed to contain only whole genomes. heuristics used to separate whole genomes from partial sequences are not fail-proof. we manually sorted these sequences into true or false negatives. im's predicted sequence hits were compared with sequences listed under a given set of taxonomy tree nodes. if a signature was reported to detect Hepatitis B then its set of TaqSim hits would be compared with the set of sequences under node 10407, corresponding to Hepatitis B virus. s e p o s i t i v e s taxonomy node selection The primary research articles were read carefully to determine what the authors had designed their primers/probes to detect. none of the articles specified a taxonomy node for their signatures. some sequences required hand sorting due to the wide array of sequence types and annotations. glued fragments represent draft genomes \"glued\" together with hundreds of \"N\"s as a simple way to keep the separate contigs associated as part of the same genome. results table 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 summarize our analysis of various DNA signatures.
