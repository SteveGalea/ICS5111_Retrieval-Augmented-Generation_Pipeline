ELISA plates coated with RS-15-BSA, YT-16-BSA, or YV-20-BSA. BSA peptide (2 g/well) overnight at 4 \u00b0C and then blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. slides were incubated with the 1C3 or 4C7 mAb (1:100) overnight at 4 \u00b0C, followed by incubation with HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG (1:2000, Sigma) the size of the recombinant GST-M protein was approximately 54 kDa. the protein reacted with the anti-GST mAb in the western blotting experiment. the western blotting results showed that both 1C3 and 4C7 reacted against GST-M7 aa 234\u2013262. aa represents amino acids. PM represents protein marker. the epitope (YSTEART) is well conserved among TGEV, but differs greatly from the sequence in PEDV and PDCoV. the location of the epitope in the predicted structure of the TGEV M protein is highlighted. mAb 1C3 (YSTEART) in the TGEV M protein is highlighted. the mAb against the N protein of TGEV was used as a positive control. an immunoprecipitation assay was performed in the TGEV-infected PK-15 cells using mAb 1C3 or 4C7 mAbs. the IFA method was optimized for the detection of the TGEV M protein. at 36 h, TGEV-infected PK-15 cells were fixed with paraformaldehyde (4%) for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C. the cells were blocked with 5% skimmed milk at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. aa 243\u2013262 (YV-20) were used to immunize mice. the epitopes were coupled with KLH and named RS-15-KLH. the antibodies elicited by RS-15-KLH, YT-16-KLH, and YV-20-KLH were detected. the recombinant proteins were expressed by induction with 1 mM IPTG in pCold-TGEV-M-transformed cells. the size of the recombinant GST-M protein was approximately 54 kDa. the protein was detected after western blotting with a GST mAb. 5 truncated M proteins (GST-M1, GST-M2, GST-M3, GST-M4 and GST-M5) were expressed. the epitope ELISA results showed that both 1C3 and 4C7 reacted against GST-M7 aa 234\u2013262. -ribosyl cyclase (SMTL id 1r15.1) was selected for model building. the identified epitope formed an alpha spiral structure (Figure 3a) the conservation of the M epitopes (YSTEART) in TGEV, PEDV, and porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) was compared. assay (IFA) and immunoperoxidase monolayer assay (IPMA) analysis of the M protein in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells using 1C3 and 4C7 mAbs. the mAb against the N protein of TGEV was used as a positive control. mAb 1C3 Reacted with the M protein in the small intestine. the TGEV M protein was recognized by mAb 1C3 but not 4C7 in TGEV-inoculated animal small intestines. the IFA method was optimized for the detection of the TGEV M protein. arginine-glycine-aspartate [40] was added on the N-terminal side of peptide aa 243\u2013249 (RS-15) and an overlay of peptide aa 243\u2013249 (YT-16) and peptide aa 243\u2013262 (YV-20) were used to immunize mice. the epitopes were coupled with KLH and named RS-15-KLH, YT-16- aa 243-249 and aa 243\u2013262 epitopes were identified for the first time. mAb 1C3 did not react with aa 244\u2013. the mAb 4C7 did not react with aa 243\u2013257, aa 244\u2013258, aa 245\u2013259 or aa 246\u2013260. the reactive activity of aa 243\u2013262 was significantly higher than the reactive activity of the other amino acids. the reactive activity of aa 243\u2013262 was significantly higher than the reactive activity of the other amino acids. mAbs 1C3 and 4C7 were located in the TGEV M protein endodomain. this information could be widely used in future research on the function of this domain in TGEV. the established assay has no advantage over other N protein-based assays. the antibody induced by aa 243\u2013262 exhibited higher activity than the antibodies induced by RS-15 and YT-16. however, the antibody to YV-20 did not react with the TGEV M protein in TGEV-infected PK-15 cells."}
