{"summary": "global transcriptional profiling was therefore performed on liver biopsies from patients with cirrhosis caused by either alcohol consumption or chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) gene expression patterns varied significantly depending upon etiology of liver disease, with more differentially regulated genes seen in HCV-infected patients. gene expression patterns in liver tissue during cirrhosis development could add valuable information to clinical tests. functional genomics is increasingly being used to investigate the mechanisms underlying the development of liver disease. the pathology of alcohol- and HCV-induced cirrhosis is very similar and characteristic fibrosis patterns leading to cirrhosis can overlap among these two distinct etiologies. a clear distinction existed between CTP classes of ALD, but not HCV-associated, cirrhosis. gene expression patterns observed were relatively uniform among HCV-cirrhotic samples compared to ethanol-related cirrhosis. the global gene expression profiles demonstrated distinct patterns among CTP classes in ethanol-related cirrhosis. each column represents gene expression data from an individual experiment. the cluster represents 2965 genes that showed a >2-fold change (P value 0.05) in at least 3 of 15 experiments. gene expression changes specific to HCV-infected cirrhotic livers are associated with induction of the innate antiviral immune response. 35, IFIT1, MX1, IFI27 \u2013 were highly up-regulated in HCV-associated samples but not included in this ANOVA. a small set of genes (ISG20, IFI16, TRIM22, STAT5A) were also highly up-regulated in nearly all samples, including ethanol-cirrhotic livers. these may play a role in an inflammatory response related to cirrhosis development regardless of etiology. is chemotactic for T cells in vitro was significantly up-regulated in all HCV-infected livers. circulating levels of natural killer cells have been shown to be suppressed under the influence of alcohol [27,28] circulating levels of natural killer cells have been shown to be suppressed under the influence of alcohol. many genes in group I (less severe cirrhosis) were associated with lipid metabolism, specifically the metabolism of cholesterol. genes involved in the function of the immune and lymphatic system, such as activation of mononuclear leukocytes, were also up-regulated in early, less severe cirrhosis. many of these genes were up-regulated during less severe cirrhosis but down-regulated by end-stage ethanol cirrhosis. many of these genes were up-regulated during less severe cirrhosis but down-regulated by end-stage ethanol cirrhosis. a similar pattern was observed for genes encoding alcohol dehydrogen. differential gene expression in ethanol-induced class A cirrhosis CTP class A alcohol-associated samples appeared to have unique expression profiles compared to all other samples regardless of etiology. a cluster of 273 were highly up-regulated in all samples but ethanol CTP class A (Fig. 4, group I), and a cluster of 109 were highly up-regulated specifically in class A (Fig. 4, group II). expression profiles of genes differentially expressed in early ethanol-related cirrhosis versus all other samples; identified by ANOVA. each column represents gene expression data from an individual experiment comparing cirrhotic and normal liver. the cluster represents genes that showed a >2-fold change (P value 0.05) in at least 3 of 15 experiments. /AST 1239 M 68 Alcohol A several years > 100 g/day 28/37 1240 M 70 Alcohol A several years > 100 g/day 36/44 1245 M 67 Alcohol A unknown unknown 19/19 1263 M 72 Alcohol A > 20 years 80 g/day 82/89 1164 M 62 Alcohol B > 30 years > 80 g/day 33/27 1227 M 59 Alcohol C 39 years active at OLT > 100 g/day 28/54 1228 M 44 Alcohol a set of 946 genes was identified as significantly (P 0.05) different with respect to expression level between the two groups. we then used Fatigo software to analyze functional groups that differ between cirrhosis etiologies. many of the genes specifically induced in HCV-associated cirrhotic livers were not up-regulated in ethanol-cirrhotic livers. cirrhosis samples were clustered based on the expression of IFN-related genes that were at least 2-fold regulated with a P value 0.05 in at least 3 of 15 experiments. cirrhotic samples were again clustered based on the expression of lymphocyte-related genes that were at least 2-fold regulated with a P value 0.05 in at least 3 of 15 experiments. expression profiles differed significantly depending on severity of alcohol cirrhosis. of 135 annotated genes up-regulated in group II, 60 were associated with cell death as compared to only 16 in group I. each column represents gene expression data from an individual experiment comparing cirrhotic and normal liver. the cluster represents genes that showed a >2-fold change (P value 0.05) in at least 3 of 7 experiments comparing cirrhotic tissue to a normal liver reference. many genes were up-regulated during less severe cirrhosis but down-regulated by end-stage ethanol cirrhosis. a defect in this enzyme leads to excessive accumulation of sterols. a cluster of 273 genes were highly up-regulated by end-stage ethanol cirrhosis. genes associated with cell death, movement, and the immune response were much more abundant in group I than in group II. most immune response genes up-regulated in group I were generally involved in proliferation and migration of leukocytes, while those in group II were again related to activation and infiltration of macrophages. gene expression patterns can also distinguish classes of ethanol-associated cirrhosis. differences in gene expression existed between early ethanol cirrhosis and all other liver samples. this suggests that the immune response may play a more prominent role in viral versus ethanol-induced cirrhosis. significant differences in gene expression patterns point to role of macrophages in liver injury during alcoholic liver disease. production of cytokines and reactive oxygen species from monocytes has been shown to increase in response to chronic alcohol intake but not in late more severe cirrhosis. CYP27A1 is an acute phase gene repressed by lipopolysaccharide and cytokines. it is possible that the down-regulation of this gene is linked to levels of cytokine activity during late-stage cirrhosis. it is possible that the down-regulation of this gene is linked to levels of cytokine activity during late-stage ethanol cirrhosis. the adaptive immune response appears to be more associated with the development of liver cirrhosis in viral-, but not alcohol-mediated disease. the study supports the idea that although these different etiologies lead to similar pathologies, the cellular mechanisms responsible for disease progression may be unique. total RNA samples were double amplified using a polytron homogenizer. the quality of amplified RNA was evaluated by capillary electrophoresis using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. human cDNA set 1 expression arrays carrying 13,026 unique cDNA clones were purchased from Agilent. the severity of cirrhosis was clinically graded according to child-turcotte-Pugh (CTP) scores. normal, uninfected liver tissue from 8 patients underwent tumor resection due to metastases of non-liver origin was collected at the same clinic. all patients gave informed prior consent to protocols approved by the University of Barcelona, Spain. all data were entered into a custom-designed database, and then uploaded into a custom-designed database. all data were entered into a custom-designed database, then uploaded into Rosetta Resolver System 4.0 (Rosetta Biosoftware, Kirkland, WA) and Spotfire Decision Suite 7.1.1 (Spotfire, Somerville, MA)"}
