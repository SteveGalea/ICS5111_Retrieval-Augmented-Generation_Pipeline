{"summary": "nascent transcripts produced by RNA polymerases universally carry a 5\u2032 triphosphate (5\u2032ppp) processed RNA molecules, such as rRNAs and tRNAs, carry a 5\u2032 triphosphate (5\u2032ppp) in several types of cellular and viral RNAs, the 5\u2032 end is further modified enzymatically, by a variety of modification enzymes. this cap is absent in bacterial and archaeal transcripts. cap0 guanosine is modified by addition of 2 methyl groups at the N2 position, yielding a trimethylguanosine (m2,2,7G or TMG) cap, in some small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) and nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) required for pre-mRNA splicing (e.g., U1, U2, U4, and U5), pre-rRNA processing (U3 and U8), and telome guanylyltransferase transfers GDP rather than GMP onto the 5\u2032 end of the RNA. the resulting cap structure is first monomethylated on the ribose of the first transcribed residue (yielding GpppAm structure), and only later the guanosine is methylated to m7G. mpAmpCmpm3Um is formed with as many as 8 methylation steps. methylations of caps in all organisms and viruses are catalyzed by S-adenosyl-l-methionine-dependent methyltransferases. the topology of the RFM fold is very similar to the typical Rossmann fold. experimentally determined structures of cap-specific methyltransferases. \u201ccap0 + cap1\u201d indicates 2 activities encoded in separate domains in one polypeptide, while \u201ccap0/cap1\u201d indicates 2 activities associated with one domain.

RNMT also has an N-terminal domain that is conserved in mammals, but not required for catalytic activity. the methyltransferase active site is located entirely in the D1 subunit and has a weak cap0 modification activity. it lacks a proper SAM binding site and does not show any methyltransferase activity on its own. in the SARS-coronavirus, a nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) was initially identified as an exoribonuclease (and termed ExoN) VP39 is a single-domain protein with additional structural elements at both the N- and C-termini. it wraps around the RFM core and form a binding pocket for the cap. in humans, cap1 formation is catalyzed by the CMTr1 enzyme. CMTr1 binds m7G in a different way, in which the sugar edge of the cap guanosine faces the protein, and the methyl group on N7 faces the solvent. these structural differences explain why CMTr1 is relatively insensitive to the absence of cap0 methylation. methylated guanine ring is stacked by 2 aromatic rings of Tyr22 and Phe180. a stick representation of the cap0 structure analog\u2014m7GpppG bound by NS5 flaviviral 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase. both of these enzymes are relatively closely related to the human CMTr1 enzyme. a third 2\u2032-O-ribose cap methyltransferase was identified and termed TbMTr3. this is responsible for the methylation of the third residue of the cap. a phylogenetic study of 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferases revealed that the relationships between cellular and viral enzymes are quite complex. the structure of the human reovirus core has been solved at low resolution, revealing a series of domains that include a putative guanylyltransferase domain and 2 putative methyltransferase (RFM) domains. it has been suggested that the order of the domains in the lambda 2 protein corresponds to the order of the capping reactions. however, comparison of domain structures suggested that the functional assignments may be different. negative-sense single-stranded RNA viruses include pathogens such as respiratory syncytial virus, measles, mumps, rabies, parainfluenza, vesicular stomatitis virus. one of the common components of the viral ribonucleoprotein core is the large (L) protein, which encodes multiple functions such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and activities responsible for mRNA capping. a number of structures were determined for the flavivirus cap methyltransferases known or predicted to be bifunctional, including dengue,59 west Nile,60 Wesselbron,61 Meaban,62 and Murray Valley encephalitis63 viruses. they all revealed high similarity to the cap1 methyltransferases, and little if any similarity to the classical cap0 methyltransferases. however, the orientation of the bound guanosine residue suggests that their mode of Tgs2 activity is apparently limited to a single round of N2 methylation, resulting in the synthesis of a 2,7-dimethylguanosine (m2,7G) product. bioinformatics analyses predicted that the Tgs enzymes are related to a large group of RFM enzymes that act on exocyclic amine groups in nucleic acid bases, including m6A, m4C, and m2G. isolated enzyme showed no activity toward internal adenosines. m6A methylome implicated the involvement of METTL3, METTL14, KIAA1429, and WTAP. an enzyme-substrate complex is not yet available. an enzyme-substrate complex is not yet available. the details of protein-RNA recognition and the mechanism of discrimination between Bin3 substrates and non-substrates remain to be determined. methyltransferases involved in cap structure biosynthesis.2,22,23 Its enzymatic activity is critical for yeast cell growth and the gene ABD1 that encodes the Abd1 protein is essential. a monomeric protein that catalyzes methyl transfer to GpppRNA to form cap0, but also to free mononucleotides GTP. secondary structure elements that correspond to elements of the conserved RFM core are labeled. in the human capping system, the cap0 methyltransferase (RNMT) consists of a catalytic subunit related to Abd1 and an obligate activating subunit, RAM (RNMT-activating miniprotein) RNMT also has an N-terminal domain that is conserved in mammals. a degenerate cap 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase domain lacks a proper SAM binding site and does not show any methyltransferase activity on its own. in the SARS-coronavirus, a nonstructural protein 14 (nsp14) was initially identified as an exoribonuclease (and termed ExoN) later, it was shown that it also exhibits cap0 methyltransferas VP39 is a single-domain protein with additional structural elements at both the N- and C-termini. it wraps around the RFM core and forms a binding pocket for the cap. in humans, cap1 formation is catalyzed by the CMTr1 enzyme. VP39 is composed of several domains, including the N-terminal catalytic RMF domain. r1 is relatively insensitive to the absence of cap0 methylation. r1 is able to act, at least in vitro, on substrates with unmethylated guanine. ligands are shown in stick representation and they are colored corresponding to the hue used for protein molecules representation. secondary structure elements outside of the conserved core are not labeled. s with cap1 methyltransferase activities were also characterized in the alfalfa looper moth Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (orf6940) and in T. brucei (TbMTr141,42) both of these enzymes are relatively closely related to the human CMTr1 enzyme. a third 2\u2032-O-ribose cap methyltransferase was identified and termed TbMTr3. this is responsible for the methylation of the third residue of the cap and is required for the methylation of the fourth residue. phylogenetic study of 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferases revealed that the relationships between cellular and viral enzymes are quite complex. putative guanylyltransferase domain and 2 putative methyltransferase (RFM) domains. the order of the domains corresponds to the order of the capping reactions: guanosine transfer followed by cap0 and cap1 methylation. however, comparison of domain structures suggested that functional assignments may be different. the large (L) protein encodes multiple functions such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and activities responsible for mRNA capping, cap0 and cap1 methylation, poly(A) polymerase and protein kinase. this region is essential not only for cap1, but also for cap0 methyltransferase activity and that the same SAM-binding site is used for both reactions. the methyltransferases share a similar cap-binding platform structure with VP39 and human CMTr1 enzymes. however, the orientation of the bound guanosine residue suggests that their mode of cap-recognition is different from both poxvirus and human enzymes. s analyses predicted that the Tgs enzymes are related to a large group of RFM enzymes that act on exocyclic amine groups in nucleic acid bases. m6A, m4C, and m2G have a characteristic NPPY-like motif at the active site. crystal structure of the human TGS1 protein has been reported. mRNA methylome following depletion of multiprotein methyltransferase complex components METTL3, METTL14, KIAA1429, and WTAP. m6A methyltransferase activity involved the METTL3, METTL14, and KIAA1429 proteins in m6A formation at the internal sites but not at the 5\u2032 sites. crystal structure of human BCDIN3 -methyltransferase is labeled. secondary structure elements outside of the conserved core are labeled. progress has been driven by the identification and characterization of novel methyltransferases that take part in cap biosynthesis. the human cap1 methyltransferase appears to be essential and cannot be knocked out in human cells. the development of inhibitors specific against that human enzyme could benefit from structure analysis of trypanosomal methyltransferases. bioinformatics analyses identified cap2 and cap3/4 methyltransferases as close homologs of the vaccinia virus. potential conflicts of interest no potential conflicts of interest disclosed. research on structural aspects of protein-RNA interactions in the Bujnicki laboratory."}
