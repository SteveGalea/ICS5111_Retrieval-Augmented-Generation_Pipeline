{"summary": "Rhipicephalus microplus (Rm) is one of the most problematic livestock tick species in the world. its rapid propagation and resistance to acaricides make it control difficult in the sub-region and Benin particularly. the aim of this work was to check its presence in wildlife. this study reported the presence of Rm in wildlife of Benin. it confirmed its role in the maintenance and spread of the parasites. it is an important risk factor that we must not neglect in the epidemiological surveillance and ticks control strategies in the west africa sub-region. studies confirm this perception for some diseases (severe acute respiratory syndrome, bird flu) for pastoralist, wildlife can be the cause of economic disasters when the survival or profitability of the domestic herd is threatened by epizootics. however, no investigation has been done on wild species following the identification and spread of Rm, which stands out for its resistance to common acaricides. the central part own a transitional Sudano-Guinean climate, between 7\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 N parallels, with both unimodal and bimodal climatic conditions. it has four-seasons (two rainy and two dry seasons) with fertile soils and degradation of ecological conditions. the rainfall reaches 1500 mm. in northern Benin, sampling was performed in the two national parks. animals and period of study Ticks were collected from February to March 2017 on 9 wild animal species that were freshly slaughtered and visibly infested. the genus and species of each tick examined were recorded. the average number of ticks was calculated for different factors including localities, animal species, and tick species. the same parameters were calculated for localities, and animal species for each species of tick observed. the central part own a transitional Sudano-Guinean climate, between 7\u00b0 and 10\u00b0 N parallels, with both unimodal and bimodal climatic conditions. it has four-seasons (two rainy and two dry seasons) with fertile soils and degradation of ecological conditions. the rainfall reaches 1500 mm. in northern Benin, sampling was performed in the two national parks. animals and period of study Ticks were collected from February to March 2017 on 9 wild animal species that were freshly slaughtered and visibly infested. the identification key was described by Walker et al. [19] using a binocular loupe. the genus and species of each tick examined were recorded. the proportion of different stages of tick development was calculated by animal species and localities to assess the importance of its prevalence. the data were adjusted to the Poisson model since the latter come from counts. average number of ticks varies from 3 to 6 between animal species, 3 to 7 between visited localities, and 2 to 5 between tick species. ricetoma 4.00a 0.55 Segbohoue 5.50ab 0.96 Rsa 5.57a 1.65 Bushbuck 3.63a 0.68 Tegon 4.00ab 1.14 Rsp 4.58a 0.57 Hare 5.50a 1.45 - - Warthog 3.50a 0.65 Prob. 0.636 0.075 0.191 Av=Amblyomma variegatum, Bd=Boophilus decoloratus, Rm=Rhipicephal 0.317 - 0.354 0.391 0.900 0.867 0.403 SE=Standard error, Prob.=Probability of the significance of the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test at only 5%. in all localities and for all animal species considered, female ticks are the most prevalent. animals: (Alu=Wild cat, Aul=Cane rat, Bic=Doe, Buf=Buffalo, Cob=Buffon cobe, Cri=Cricetoma, Gui=Bushbuck, Lie=Hare, and Pha=Warthog) average number of ticks and standard error per tick and animal species. 0.317 - 0.2101 0.391 0.654 0.199 0.495 SE=Standard error, Prob.=Probability of the significance of the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test at only 5%. the abundance of ticks observed depends only on localities (p>0.05) the highest average number of ticks is obtained on doe (Cervus elaphus) and Wildcat (Felis silvestris) in the locality of Adomougon (Table-1).
