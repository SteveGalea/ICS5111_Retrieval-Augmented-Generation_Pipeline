{"summary": "studies have concluded that air travel restrictions may not have a significant impact on the course of a pandemic. domestic airline travel volume in November predicts the rate of influenza spread (r 2 = 0.60; p = 0.014; p = 0.016) researchers analyzed weekly government records on deaths from influenza and pneumonia in cities from nine regions of the us during the nine influenza seasons between 1996 and 2005. they then used government estimates of passenger air travel to explore any connection with the timing of the annual flu epidemics. influenza was found to spread more slowly during years when the number of domestic air travelers, particularly during November, was lower. study does not demonstrate that travel restriction would be effective in altering the course of a flu pandemic. but it does provide evidence that air travel plays a significant role in the annual spread of influenza in the united states. air travel affects both the peak date and the rate of spread of influenza. inter-regional influenza spread may be more significantly influenced by long-range airline travel, which comprises almost half of all movement at distances greater than 1,000 miles. filtered time series plus mean accounts for 99.8% of the mortality, indicating that most deaths are from the mean and seasonal variation and not the high-frequency cycles. data on weekly mortality from pneumonia and influenza (P&I) were obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 121 Cities Mortality Reporting System (cdc.gov/EPO/DPHSI/121hist.htm) for nine influenza seasons, from 1996\u20131997 to 2004\u20132005. time series analysis is a well known method for revealing time-dependent phenomena that are not necessarily apparent in raw data. we used band-pass filtering to isolate patterns around the yearly (seasonal) signal of influenza. essentially, we extract a range of seasonal frequencies of interest from the time series while rejecting frequencies outside that range. seasonal phase shifts are estimated by the 99% confidence interval. we modeled changes in the rate of inter-regional spread of seasonal influenza mortality as a response to yearly fluctuations in domestic airline volume. influenza activity begins to increase in November [18], and viral isolate collections by the world health organization show that all regions have influenza activity as of January each year. in order to account for this factor, we included the dominant subtype (A/H3N2 or A/H1N1) as a categorical variable in our stepwise regression model [19]. previous studies have shown that colder conditions promote human indoor crowding and thus increased virus transmission. high-quality data were available at the national scale for the eight influenza seasons from 1997\u20131998 to 2004\u20132005, and at the regional scale for the six influenza seasons from 1999\u20132000 to 2004\u20132005. for each season, we calculated the national peak dates of viral activity. also, we calculated the yearly time to transnational spread based on peak week of regional viral activity available from 1999\u20132005. the 122 cities that report mortality due to P&I are displayed (black dots) for each region, we characterized the seasonality of influenza mortality by filtering. band-pass filtering is a well known method for revealing time-dependent phenomena that are not apparent in raw data. for each influenza year, coincidence in the timing of seasonal influenza mortality across geographic regions was estimated from the phase shift with a national seasonal curve. we divided the filtered data into subsets by influenza year (week 40 of one year to week 39 of the following year) we then performed cross-correlation with the national time series for each possible comparison. monthly estimates of passengers on domestic flights were obtained for November to January of each influenza season [17]. this range was selected because influenza activity begins to increase in November [18], and viral isolate collections by the World Health Organization and national Respiratory and Enteric Virus Surveillance System (WHO/NREVSS) collaborating laboratories show that all regions have influenza activity as of January each year. we collected climate data to account for the effect of winter temperature. previous studies have shown that colder conditions promote human indoor crowding and thus increased virus transmission. we also examined the effects of the temperature of individual winter months as covariates. for each season, we calculated the national peak dates of viral activity. we calculated the yearly time to transnational spread based on peak week of regional viral activity available from 1999\u20132005. in order to establish causal link between flight reductions in the us after the terrorist attack on September 11, 2001, and a delayed epidemic peak. the time to transnational spread decreased from 24\u201326 d during the 1996\u20131997 and 1997\u20131998 influenza seasons to 8\u201311 d during 1999\u20132000 and 2000\u20132001 seasons. the 2001\u20132002 influenza season (following September 11, 2001) manifested an increase, with a time to transnational spread of 16 d, 68% longer than for the previous two seasons. influenza season following September 11, 2001 had a markedly delayed peak, on March 2, 2002, 13 d later than average. subsequent influenza seasons, 2002\u20132003, 2003\u20132004, and 2004\u20132005 progressively returned to baseline, with peaks on February 29, 19, and 17, respectively. an inverse correlation was found between time to transnational spread of influenza and the number of traveling domestic passengers during the November to January period. the timing displayed is relative to the average date of February 17. the association between international airline travel in September and the timing of the US influenza peak is displayed. the numbers of traveling international passengers in September significantly predicts the timing of seasonal influenza mortality. strain type did not account for any significant amount of variability in transnational spread or peak time of influenza mortality. peaks in the seasonal mortality data occurred about a month after those in the viral data. a seasonal time series plus mean can explain 99.8% of the national mortality. the yearly component of influenza takes approximately 2 wk on average to peak over all US regions. the time to transnational spread decreased from 24\u201326 d during the 1996\u20131997 and 1997\u20131998 influenza seasons. for each influenza year, phase shifts are calculated as the maximum value from cross-correlation of the band-pass filtered weekly P&I mortality data. plot shows shifts in the yearly phase, with the 1999\u20132000 season exhibiting an overall earlier peak and the 2001\u20132002 season exhibiting an overall later peak across all regions. domestic airline volume in November was the single significant predictor of influenza spread (r 2 = 0.60; p = 0.014) this relationship was especially evident for the 1997\u20131998 season. there was both the lowest airline volume (39 million passengers) and the slowest spread (26 d) international travel in September was the single month to significantly predict the seasonal national peak (r 2 = 0.59; p = 0.016) this is especially evident during 2001\u20132002, when international flight volume decreased by 27%, from 4.9 million international passengers to 3.5 million, and peak influenza mortality was delayed by 2 wk. a continued trend back to baseline peak was found during the 2003\u20132004 and 2004\u20132005 seasons. the estimated spread and peak of the filtered mortality and viral data were well correlated, with Spearman rank correlations of 0.928 (p = 0.004) and 0.695 (p = 0.028), respectively. the time to transnational spread was 53 d, 60% longer than the average of 33 d, which is a statistically significant difference. the effect of airline volume on long-range spread is largely based on travel in November. international airline travel influences the absolute timing of seasonal influenza mortality. influenza activity usually begins to increase as early as October or November. strain variation could have an effect on our measures. studies have shown that influenza spreads more efficiently during seasons dominated by subtype A/H3N2 than when A/H1N1 or B dominate. based on US multiple cause-of-death files [29] provide longer and more comprehensive time series of influenza mortality. however, yearly data become available only after 3 y, and therefore cannot be used for the current analysis. 121 Cities Mortality Reporting System provides a more current time series of influenza mortality. a more detailed national dataset of confirmed influenza infections and matched strain information would be ideal, but our study demonstrates how analyses of imperfect influenza surveillance data can reveal important spatial\u2013temporal trends. the alarming spread of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A (subtype H5N1) in both wild and domestic poultry has intensified the debate over whether border control and travel restrictions could substantially impede the spatial spread of an emerging strain. fluctuations in airline travel have an impact on large-scale spread of influenza. our results suggest an important influence of international air travel on influenza timing. however, the efficacy of travel advisories, flight restrictions, or even complete flight bans as a control measure is still uncertain."}
