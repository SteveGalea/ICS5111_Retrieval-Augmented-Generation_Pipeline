{"summary": "BN-PAGE analyses first used BN-PAGE analyses to study time course of Env protomer activation in vitro. if the protomers were simultaneously activated, intermediate forms were not expected to appear, only SU monomers and TM trimers. intermediate incubation times showed gradual increase of SU-TM disulfide isomerization (Fig. 1A, lanes 2\u20136) was correlated with a stepwise reduction of the size of the Env complex (Fig. 1B, lanes 2\u20136) forming two intermediates, I-1 and I-2, before reaching the completely isomerized stage. BN-PAGE analyses of the fractionated gradient with the activated sample showed Env-related proteins and protein complexes in B (after normalization to internal proteins in the front band), with C\u2032 to highlight the less abundant forms. to increase the TM signal, we switched to [35S] Met/Cys-labeled Mo-MLV instead of purely [35S] Cys-labeled virus. corresponding SDS/PAGE analyses showed the SU-TM content of the nonactivated Env trimers, but the absence of noncovalently associated TM. p12 protein migrated as a diffuse band close to I-2 and SU in the activated sample. fractions were analyzed for viral proteins by BN-PAGE (A and C) and nonreducing SDS/PAGE (B and D) a portion of the sample has been analyzed directly by SDS/PAGE (1D) the directions of the 2D electrophoreses are indicated. the directions of the 2D electrophoreses are indicated. a [35S] Met/Cys-labeled virus sample was first run on a 3\u201314% (wt/vol) BN-PAGE. a direct BN/SDS/PAGE analysis of the sample was run next to the 2D analysis to provide markers for the viral proteins and their covalent complexes in the 2D gel. some of the SU-TM complexes of the Env trimers had apparently not become completely dissociated and were left behind as a top spot. further down and to the right we identified the CA spot, which smeared considerably to the left, indicating oligomerization. XC cells were spinoculated with [35S] Met/Cys-labeled virus in the cold, shifted to 29 \u00b0C, and first incubated for 0\u201313 min without alkylator (MBTA) then in the presence of 0.4 mM MBTA for 0 or 5 min (+MBTA) as indicated, solubilized in the presence of EDTA and NEM. we found that I-2 contained about 2 noncovalently associated TM per one SU-TM. the lower-than-expected noncovalent TM content of I-1 can at least partly be a result of contamination of the I-1 SU-TM spot with that of intact trimers. an important question was then whether this was also the case during receptor-mediated activation on cells. [35S] Cys-labeled Mo-MLV was spinoculated in the cold onto XC cells and incubated at 24 \u00b0C for the indicated times. the virus/cell samples were solubilized in the presence of EDTA and NEM. isomerization of the SU-TM complexes into SU and TM still took place in the presence of 0.4 mM MBTA (Fig. 4A, lanes 1\u20135). extending the incubation beyond 13 min did not increase the efficiency. the virus/cell samples were solubilized with TX-100 in the presence of EDTA and NEM. the identities of the putative intermediates were confirmed by velocity sedimentation in an NDSB-201 gradient and 2D SDS/BN-PAGE analyses. 2D-BN/SDS/PAGE analyses of the compositions of receptor-activated and MBTA-alkylated Env intermediates. XC cells were spinoculated with [35S] Met/Cys labeled virus in the cold and left inactivated (A and B) or activated by incubation for 13 min at 29 \u00b0C with 0.4 mM MBTA (C and D) a sequential protomer activation process should yield more I-1 relative to I-2 at early points of the incubation than at later ones. this difference could be undetectable with a continuous alkylation protocol, as used earlier, but revealed with MBTA pulses. the amount of I-2 was given as percentage of I-1 + I-2 (SD) and found to increase from 32% when pulsed early (after 0 min); to 44%, when pulsed in the middle (after 4 min); and to 52%, when pulsed late (after 8 min) the early and late values were compared in a paired one-tailed t test with unequal variance. the result suggested the increase was significant (P = 0.01) the DTT treatment changed the ladders of the XC cell-activated virus to that of more I-2 and free TM trimers. the increase of free TM was also seen in the nonreducing SDS/PAGE analyses. this suggests that the DTT treatment does not reduce Envs without receptor triggering (21). mers were simultaneously activated, intermediate forms were not expected to appear, only SU monomers and TM trimers, TM3. the gradual increase of SU-TM disulfide isomerization was correlated with a stepwise reduction of a stepwise reduction. two intermediates, I-1 and I-2, were formed after normalization to internal viral proteins in the front band. this result was consistent with a sequential protomer activation model in which the protomers are isomerized and lose their SU one after each other, according to the scheme (SU-TM)3. BN-PAGE analyses showed SU-TM complexes and possible noncovalently associated TM by nonreducing SDS/PAGE. the double-labeled virus was activated for 15 min at 29 \u00b0C during solubilization or left unactivated. p12 oligomerized at BN-PAGE conditions and migrated as a diffuse band close to I-2 and SU. p12 protein migrated as a diffuse band close to I-2 and SU. BN-PAGE analyses of fractions 8\u201315 from the sedimentation of solubilized nonactivated virus shown in Fig. 2A. a portion of the sample has been analyzed directly by SDS/PAGE (1D) this provides markers for the migration of the viral proteins in the 2D analysis. stoichiometric ratio between SU-TM complexes and noncovalently associated TM in I-1 and I-2 was analyzed by 2D BN/SDS/PAGE. if TM is noncovalently associated with I-1 or I-2, each of these will appear as a spot of SU-TM with a spot of TM straight below (but at the bottom part of the gel) row of SU-TM spots from left to right was the SU spot of completely isomerized protomers. further down and to the right we identified the CA spot, which smeared considerably to the left. the two spots on the right side must represent TM subunits from TM trimer and monomer populations, respectively, of completely isomerized Env (25). 0\u201313 min without alkylator (MBTA) and then in the presence of 0.4 mM MBTA for 0 or 5 min (+MBTA) as indicated, solubilized in the presence of EDTA and NEM, and virus/cell samples analyzed on 2D BN/SDS/PAGE. the positions of I-1, I-2, and TM3 in the first dimension BN-PAGE are indicated at the top. in vitro activation of Env, intersubunit disulfide is isomerized and SU released sequentially from one protomer after the other. the virus was spinoculated onto the cells and incubated for 0\u201360 min at 24 \u00b0C before NEM was added. the virus/cell samples were solubilized in the presence of EDTA and NEM. the nonreducing SDS/PAGE analyses showed that isomerization of the SU-TM complexes into SU and TM still took place in the presence of 0.4 mM MBTA. extending the incubation beyond 13 min did not increase the efficiency. the BN-PAGE analysis showed that at these conditions, it was possible to catch apparent I-1 and I-2 intermediates. corresponding bands were clearly identifiable in increasing strength with the incubation. mo-MLV was spinoculated in the cold onto XC and DF-1 cells. a second incubation was done in PBS without or with 20 mM DTT. the virus/cell samples were solubilized with TX-100 in the presence of EDTA and NEM. Met/Cys labeled virus in the cold and left inactivated (A and B) or activated by incubation for 13 min at 29 \u00b0C with 0.4 mM MBTA (C and D) both samples were solubilized in the presence of EDTA and NEM. both samples were solubilized in the presence of EDTA and NEM. a sequential protomer activation process should yield more I-1 relative to I-2 at early points of the incubation than at later ones. the difference could be undetectable with a continuous alkylation protocol, as used earlier, but revealed with MBTA pulses. the early and late values were compared in a paired one-tailed t test. the result suggested the increase was significant (P = 0.01) the activity could be rescued by reducing the intersubunit disulfide with DTT. the XC cell-activated virus was obtained at all MBTA concentrations. the increase of free TM was also seen in the nonreducing SDS/PAGE analyses. this suggests that the DTT treatment reduced the intersubunit disulfide in the alkylation-arrested forms of I-1, I-2, and trimeric Env generating new, later-stage intermediates and TM trimers. subunits of the isomerized protomers stay noncovalently associated with the partially activated Env. a single receptor\u2013protomer interaction might also be sufficient. this model could explain why the activation reaction was so much slower in vitro than in vivo. the fusion peptide cannot be locked in the target membrane and facilitate activation in that way. it is possible the Ca2+ stabilizes an Env conformation with hidden fusion peptide, and its removal allows fusion peptide exposure and Env activation, but less efficiently. the binding of single antigen binding fragment (Fab) of the broadly neutralizing Abs PG9 and PG16 to HIV-1 Env blocked the binding of sCD4 to all three protomers (30). however, the binding of one sCD4 or one CD4 binding site Ab, b12, Fab to one protomer facilitated the binding of the ligands to the other protomers (30). 293T cells were transfected with 20 g proviral DNA per 175 cm2 bottle. the cultures were labeled with either 0.2 mCi/mL Expre35s35s, [35S] Protein Labeling Mix, [35S] Met/Cys, or 0.1 mCi/mL l-[35S] Cysteine (NEG022T005MC), that is, [35S] Cysteine (NEG022T each stock (50 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2 at pH 7.4) was frozen in dry ice and stored at 80 \u00b0C. each stock was checked for R-peptide cleavage and SU-TM intersubunit disulfide bond integrity. DF-1 cells were washed twice in ice cold Dulbecco\u2019s PBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+ (PBS), shifted to 29 \u00b0C, 350 L growth medium without or to capture intermediates. cells were then incubated for the indicated times and temperatures, typically 0\u201313 min at 29 \u00b0C. samples were layered on 0.4\u20131.2 M NDSB-201 gradients in HNC containing 0.05% Triton X-100 and sedimented for 16 h at 1.6 105 g (36 krpm) in a Beckman SW 55 rotor. gradients were fractionated from the bottom. BN-PAGE gels were fixed in 50% (vol/vol) methanol and 7% (vol/vol) acetic acid. labeled proteins were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager FX. 293T, XC, and DF-1 cells were transfected with 20 g proviral DNA per 175 cm2 bottle. the cultures were labeled with either 0.2 mCi/mL Expre35s35s, [35S] Protein Labeling Mix, [35S] Met/Cys, or 0.1 mCi/mL l-[35S] Cysteine (NEG022T005MC) labeled and gradient-purified Mo-MLV was activated by Ca2+ depletion in HN buffer (50 mM Hepes, 100 mM NaCl at pH 7.4) containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 10 mM EDTA, 1 M 3-(1-Pyridinio)-1-propanesulfonate (NDSB-201) and 1% protease-inhibitor mixture for general use. insoluble matter was removed from the virus/cell samples by low-speed centrifugation. cells were spinoculated and incubated without and with MBTA for 13 min at 29 \u00b0C. cells were washed twice with 1 mL PBS containing 20 mM NEM and extracted with Triton X-100. BN-PAGE containing 3\u201314% (wt/vol) acrylamide gradients, as described. the cathode buffer contained 0.002% and 0.01% Serva Blue G for virus extracts and virus/cell extracts. labeled proteins were visualized and quantified using a Molecular Imager FX. radioactivity in individual protein spots was normalized to account for their Cys or Met/Cys content. the SU-TM contains 7 Met and 24 Cys, while the TM contains 5 Met and 4 Cys."}
