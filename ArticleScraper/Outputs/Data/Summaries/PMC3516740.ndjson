{"summary": "bovine coronavirus (BCoV),3 human OC43 coronavirus (HCoV-OC43) and mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV) all belong to the -genus. MHV causes enteritis and respiratory disease in cattle, HCoV-OC43 causes respiratory disease in humans, and hepatitis, enteritis, and neurological disease in mice. 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid and 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid can serve as receptors for some -genus and -genus coronaviruses. two other cell-surface proteins, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and aminopeptidase N, can serve as receptors for some -genus and -genus coronaviruses. how coronaviruses have evolved to recognize these diverse receptors MHV also contains a hemagglutinin-esterase gene in its genome. but only some of the MHV strains express the hemagglutinin-esterase protein (26) these observations raise interesting questions about the origin and evolution of coronavirus spike protein lectin domains. the corresponding twinning operator (h+k, k, l) was applied to the following procedures. the structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser software (28) with the structure of MHV NTD (Protein Data Bank code 3R4D) as the search model. coronavirus NTDs were dried completely, blocked with BSA, washed five times with PBS, incubated with mouse anti-His6 antibody (Invitrogen), washed five times with PBS, incubated with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody (1:5000), and washed five times with PBS. the binding reactions between coronavirus NTDs and mucin were stopped with 1 n HCl. mucin or CEACAM1 was directly immobilized on a C5 sensor chip. the surface of the sensor chip was activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide. the remaining activated surface of the chip was blocked with ethanolamine. mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was performed. structure determination BCoV NTD (residues 15\u2013298) was expressed and purified as described previously for MHV NTD (residues 15\u2013296) (22). the protein contained a signal peptide (residues 1\u201314) and a C-terminal His6 tag. \u00b0, 90.00\u00b0, 120.00\u00b0 Wavelength 0.97918 Resolution range () 50.0\u20131.55 No. of reflections 46,536

Carbohydrate ELISA CEACAM1-binding assays of coronavirus NTDs were performed the same way as sugar-binding assays. the mammalian CEACAM1 proteins (60 g/ml in PBS), instead of mucin, were coated in the wells of the plates. however, the CEACAM1 proteins used in this study all had a C-terminal Fc tag. the pFastbac I plasmid was PCR-amplified using two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations. the mutant plasmid was transformed into DH5 competent cells, amplified, purified, and used to express the mutant protein in sf9 insect cells. a glycan screen array was performed at the Consortium for Functional Glycomics. crystals of BCoV NTD were grown in sitting drops at 20 \u00b0C, with 1 l of protein solution and 1 l well solution containing 2.0 m (NH4)2SO4. the data were twinned with a twinning fraction of 0.41 (27) the structure was refined to 1.55 using Refmac software (29) bovine submaxillary gland mucin was coated in the wells of 96-well Maxisorp plates (Nunc) the wells were dried completely, blocked with BSA, and incubated with 1 m coronavirus NTDs containing a C-terminal His6 tag. the resulting yellow color was read at 450 nm. a protein G column instead of an nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid column was used as one of the purification steps for the CEACAM1 proteins used in this study. the binding reactions between coronavirus NTDs and mucin or CEACAM1 were assayed by surface plasmon resonance using a Biacore 2000. glycan array (CFG version 5.0) was composed of 611 different natural and synthetic mammalian glycans. array slides were incubated with BCoV NTD with a C-terminal His6 tag. readout was described arbitrarily as relative fluorescence unit. structure of MHV NTD was determined by molecular replacement using Phaser software (28). structure was refined to 1.55 using Refmac software (29) ELISA CEACAM1-binding assays of coronavirus NTDs were performed the same way as sugar-binding assays, except that mammalian CEACAM1 proteins (60 g/ml in PBS) instead of mucin, were coated in the wells of the plates. all of the CEACAM1 proteins were soluble in solution. mutagenesis Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to introduce mutations into BCoV NTD. mutant plasmid was PCR-amplified using two complementary oligonucleotides containing the desired mutations. the mutant plasmid that remained was transformed into DH5 competent cells. the structure of BCoV NTD has been refined to Rwork of 16.3% and Rfree of 17.7%. the final model contains all the residues of BCoV NTD, three of the C-terminal His6 tag, three N-linked glycans, five ions, and 216 solvent molecules. in MHV and HCoV-OC43 NTDs, the four highlighted and brown-colored residues between 11 and 13 are critical sugar-binding residues. in all three NTDs, the highlighted region covering part of 10 and loop 10\u201311 varies significantly in length. the MHV NTD structure in complex with mCEACAM1a was refined to 3.1 resolution, whereas the BCoV NTD structure has been refined to 1.55 resolution. the current BCoV NTD structure presents a significantly more complete and a much higher resolution view of a coronavirus NTD. human CEACAM1 has only one form encoded by one allele. MHV NTD binds mCEACAM1a with high affinity and mCEACAM1b with low affinity. MHV NTD does not bind sugar or any of the CEACAM1 proteins from bovine or human. mCEACAM1, murine CEACAM1, bovine CEACAM1; hCEACAM1, human CEACAM1. differences in CEACAM1-binding specificities of coronavirus NTDs can be readily explained by the structural differences between BCoV and MHV NTDs. HCoV-OC43 NTDs contain a long insertion in this region. mutant proteins showed the same expression levels, solubility, and chromatographic behaviors as the wild-type BCoV NTD. critical sugar-binding residues are colored brown, and non-critical residues are colored yellow. D, distribution of mutated residues in the pocket underneath the -sandwich core. we performed glycan screen arrays to evaluate the binding affinity between BCoV NTD and different types of sugar. of the 611 types of sugar that were screened, only Neu5,9Ac2 showed high affinity for BCoV NTD. however, it is not clear whether any other type of sugar may also have high affinity for BCoV NTD. the sugar-binding sites in the two proteins overlap. this is in contrast to rotavirus VP4, another viral lectin. but the sugar-binding sites and specificity may vary depending on the viral lectin. compared with MHV NTD, loop 12\u201313 in BCoV NTD has a markedly different conformation that allows it to function as a sugar-binding loop and precludes its CEACAM1-binding capability. a critical sugar-binding residue in BCoV NTD, Glu-182, is a glycine in MHV NTD. coronavirus NTDs have evolved additional structural elements that are not found in host galectins. these structural elements may interact with other parts of coronavirus spike proteins and/or may be used to recognize specific host receptors. this finding supports the common evolutionary origin of these proteins but also suggests that coronavirus NTDs have diverged from host galectins in their sugar substrate specificities. coronaviruses could evolve lectin functions twice, first from host galectin and second from CEACAM1-binding NTDs. but no dramatic structural evolution of their NTDs was necessary for coronaviruses to switch from sugar-binding specificity to CEACAM1-binding specificity. coronaviruses adopted a successful evolutionary strategy when they stole a host protein and evolved it into viral receptor-binding domains. structure Determination We expressed BCoV NTD (residues 15\u2013298) in insect cells, purified it from insect cell culture medium, and crystallized it in space group P3121, with one BCoV NTD in each asymmetric unit. application of the twinning operator allowed the structure to be determined by molecular replacement using MHV NTD. two highlighted regions, one covering 2\u2032 and part of 3 and the other at the C terminus, are disordered (22) in MHV NTD, the four highlighted and red-colored regions are CEACAM1-binding RBMs (RBM1\u20134 from N to C terminus) in all three NTDs, the highlighted region covering part of 10 and loop 10\u201311 varies significantly in length. the BCoV NTD structure contains additional structural elements underneath the core structures that were disordered in the MHV NTD structure. these additional structural elements form a four-stranded -sheet and an -helix that may in involved in interacting with other parts of the trimeric spike protein. the current BCoV NTD structure presents a significantly more complete and a much higher resolution view of a coronavirus NTD. both murine and bovine CEACAM1 exist in two slightly different forms, CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b, which are encoded by two alleles. MHV NTD binds mCEACAM1a with high affinity and mCEACAM1b with low affinity. all of the binding activities have been calibrated against the binding activity between MHV and mCEACAM1a. affinities between coronavirus NTDs and sugar moieties on mucin-immobilized sensor chips were also shown. both MHV and HCoV-OC43 NTDs contain a long insertion in this region. we expressed and purified each of these mutant proteins using ELISA. mutant proteins showed the same expression levels, solubility, and chromatographic behaviors as wild-type BCoV NTD. oV NTD and sugar moieties on mucin by surface plasmon resonance using Biacore. mucin was immobilized on Biacore chips, and BCoV NTD was flown through. glycan screen arrays to evaluate binding affinity between BCoV NTD and different types of sugar. only Neu5,9Ac2 showed high affinity for BCoV NTD. it is not clear whether any other type of sugar may also have high affinity for BCoV NTD. comparison between BCoV NTD and human galectins suggests that Neu5,9Ac2 binds into the pocket above the -sandwich core in the BCoV NTD structure. the sugar-binding sites in the two proteins overlap. this is in contrast to rotavirus VP4, another viral lectin that also has a human galectin fold. loop 12\u201313 in MHV NTD is one of the mCEACAM1a-binding sites. compared with MHV NTD, loop 12\u201313 in MHV NTD has a markedly different conformation that allows it to function as a sugar-binding loop. a critical sugar-binding residue in BCoV NTD is a glycine in MHV NTD. coronavirus NTDs have evolved additional structural elements that are not found in host galectins. this finding supports the common evolutionary origin of these proteins but also suggests that coronavirus NTDs have diverged from host galectins in their sugar substrate specificities. coronaviruses evolved lectin functions twice, first from host galectin and second from CEACAM1-binding MHV NTD. this would be an evolutionary detour for coronaviruses to evolve lectin functions twice, first from host galectin and second from CEACAM1-binding NTD. however, no dramatic structural evolution of their NTDs was necessary for coronaviruses to switch from sugar-binding specificity to CEACAM1 -binding domains with altered sugar receptor specificity as in contemporary BCoV or novel protein receptor specificity as in contemporary MHV. arrows indicate the locations of CEACAM1 or sugar that binds coronavirus spike protein lectin domain. region includes three of the critical sugar-binding residues. -Strands are shown as arrows, and -helices are shown as cylinders. sequence alignment of BCoV, HCoV-OC43, and MHV NTDs. the core structure has the same structural topology as human galectins. the MHV NTD structure contains several peripheral structural elements. this includes a four-stranded -sheet and an -helix. mCEACAM1 Binding We systematically characterized interactions between coronavirus NTDs and mammalian CEACAM1 proteins in vitro. both murine and bovine CEACAM1 exist in two slightly different forms, CEACAM1a and CEACAM1b, which are encoded by two alleles. binding activities between coronavirus NTDs and sugar moieties on mucin-coated plates were also shown. all of the binding activities have been calibrated against the binding activity between MHV and mCEACAM1a. we grafted loop 10\u201311 from MHV NTD into BCoV NTD. the mutant proteins showed the same expression levels, solubility, and chromatographic behaviors as the wild-type BCoV NTD. all of the sugar-binding activities have been calibrated against the sugar-binding activity of wild-type and mutant BCoV NTDs. B, binding affinity between BCoV NTD and sugar moieties on mucin by surface plasmon resonance using Biacore. BCoV NTD 182E/A 8.63 104 1.65 102 1.91 107 0.28 107 BSM/BCoV NTD 184W/A 4.77 104 1.97 102 4.14 107 0.414 107 BSM/BCoV NTD 185H/A 5.97 105 7.7 102 1.29 107 0.134 107 What type of sugar is preferred by BCoV NTD. acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) shows the highest affinity for BCoV NTD. we suggest that Neu5,9Ac2 binds into the pocket above the -sandwich core in the BCoV NTD structure. this is in contrast to rotavirus VP4, another viral lectin that also has a human galectin fold. MHV NTD does not use sugar as a receptor (Fig. 2) (6). loop 12\u201313 in MHV NTD is one of the mCEACAM1a-binding sites. a critical sugar-binding residue in MHV NTD, Glu-182, is a glycine in MHV NTD. coronavirus NTDs have evolved additional peripheral structural elements that are not found in host galectins. this finding supports the common evolutionary origin of these proteins but also suggests that coronavirus sugar-binding NTDs have diverged from host galectins in their sugar substrate specificities. coronaviruses may have evolved from sugar-binding MHV NTDs. lectin function has been conserved in the NTDs of some contemporary coronaviruses. this would be an evolutionary detour for coronaviruses to evolve lectin functions twice, first from host galectin and second from CEACAM1-binding NTD. coronaviruses adopted a successful evolutionary strategy when they stole a host protein. they evolved it into viral receptor-binding domains with altered sugar receptor specificity as in contemporary BCoV or novel protein receptor specificity as in contemporary MHV. the two potential sugar-binding pockets above and underneath the core structure are indicated as \u201ccore\u201d. this region includes three of the critical sugar-binding residues. -Strands are shown as arrows, and -helices are shown as cylinders. BCoV NTD contains a -sandwich core structure consisting of one six-stranded -sheet and one seven-stranded -sheet that are stacked together through hydrophobic interactions. this core structure has the same structural topology as human galectins. however, the BCoV NTD structure contains additional peripheral structural elements underneath the core structures. receptor-binding motifs 1 and 4 are colored brown and shown in stick-and-ball presentation. one-directional arrows indicate the location of mCEACAM1a that binds MHV NTD. both murine and bovine CEACAM1 exist in two slightly different forms. CEACAM1-binding NTDs were detected using antibodies against their C-terminal His6 tags. all of the binding activities have been calibrated against the binding activity between MHV and mCEACAM1a. TDs explain why BCoV and HCoV-OC43 NTDs cannot bind any of the mammalian CEACAM1 proteins. sugar Binding Our efforts to determine the crystal structure of BCoV NTD complexed with sugar have been unsuccessful so far. instead, we systematically performed alanine substitutions of residues in two potential sugar-binding pockets, one above the -sandwich core and one underneath. sugar-binding activities of both wild-type and mutant BCoV NTDs were measured. all of the sugar-binding activities have been calibrated against the sugar-binding activity of wild-type and mutant BCoV NTD. glycan screen arrays were performed to evaluate binding affinity between BCoV NTD and different types of sugar. only Neu5,9Ac2 showed high affinity for BCoV NTD. this suggests an elegant co-evolutionary relationship between the two proteins. 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) shows the highest affinity for BCoV NTD. we suggest that Neu5,9Ac2 binds into the pocket above the -sandwich core in the BCoV NTD structure and has direct contacts with residues Tyr-162, Glu-182, Trp-184, and His-185. the four critical galactose-binding residues in MHV NTD are distributed on two sugar-binding loops. compared with MHV NTD, loop 12\u201313 in MHV NTD has a markedly different conformation that allows it to function as a sugar-binding loop and precludes its CEACAM1-binding capability. a shortened loop 10\u201311 in MHV NTD abolishes sugar binding by altering the conformations of the sugar-binding loops. a shortened loop 10\u201311 in MHV NTD abolishes sugar binding by altering the conformations of the sugar-binding loops. this finding supports the common evolutionary origin of these proteins. study provides insights into the structures, functions, and evolution of coronavirus NTDs. it is unlikely that the sugar-binding specificity of contemporary MHV NTDs evolved from sugar-binding coronaviruses to CEACAM1-binding specificity. this would be an evolutionary detour for coronaviruses to evolve lectin functions twice. coronaviruses adopted a successful evolutionary strategy when they stole a host protein. they evolved it into viral receptor-binding domains with altered sugar receptor specificity as in contemporary BCoV or novel protein receptor specificity as in contemporary MHV."}
