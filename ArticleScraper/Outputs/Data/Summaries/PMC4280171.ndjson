{"summary": "cAMP and cGMP bind to the regulatory units of protein kinase A(PKA) allowing for phosphorylation thus transducing signal cascades in the cell [1]\u2013[3]. cAMP and cGMP bind to the regulatory units of protein kinase A(PKA) allowing for phosphorylation. cAMP and cGMP bind to the regulatory units of protein kinase A(PKA) opium alkaloid, Papaverine, was shown to inhibit PDE10. selectively inhibiting PDE4 prevents the release of cytokines. cytokine storm occurs in response to infection with virulent pathogens. the extract of Forsythia suspensa seeds is used to treat numerous inflammatory diseases including but not limited to erysipelas, inflammation, pharyngitis, pyrexia, tonsillitis, and ulcers [21]. Medicinal chemistry studies on Forsythia seeds have revealed phenolic compounds including lignans and flavonols which are suspected to be responsible for the various biological activities of the herb. over 100 high value lead compounds were generated through ZINCPharmer. 14 compounds were selected for further testing using an in vitro phosphodiesterase activity assay. forsythin is an inhibitor of PDE4 and can be hydrolyzed. Compound 7, which is Forsythin, exhibited [IC50] PDE4 = 8 M. other custom designed compounds exhibited much greater potency with an [IC50] towards PDE4 ranging from 10\u201390 nM. tested compounds reduce TNF secretion in mouse RAW264.7 and human PBMCs. cells were primed with compounds at different concentration for 3 h before treated with LPS (1 ng/ml) for additional 8 h. mice were challenged with LPS (E. coli, 3 mg/kg, i.t.) followed by i.p. administration of vehicle, 1 mg/kg of compound 2, 6, 7 or 9. lungs were lavaged with saline, harvested, and then homogenized. C57/BL6 mice were administered i.p. nothing (CON), vehicle, 10 ug/kg, 100 ug/kg, 1 mg/kg or 10 mg/kg of compounds 6, 7 or 9. mice were given LPS (E. coli, 100 g) 10 min later through an i.p. injection. 2 h later the mice were euthanized using pentobarbital. PDE4 inhibitors also decreased lavage cell counts, protein concentrations, and lavage cytokine IL-6 and TNF. the tested compounds were also able to lessen signs of tissue injury. these results suggest that the selective PDE4 inhibitors suppress inflammation and preserve lung homeostasis. forsythin is an o-linked -D-glucopyranosylated lignin that can be hydrolyzed to remove a glucose moiety. a computer based docking analysis of the target compounds was performed using LibDock (Discovery Studio, Accelrys Software Inc./BIOVIA, San Diego, CA) 14 compounds were selected for further testing using an in vitro phosphodiesterase activity assay. tested compounds exhibit high potency and selectivity towards PDE4. compound 7 exhibited [IC50] TNF = 8\u201310 M in RAW264.7 and PBMC cells. other custom designed compounds such as 6, 9 and 13 exhibited greater potency with an [IC50] towards TNF ranging from 25\u201375 nM. compounds were administered to mice at various doses through an i.p. injection 10 min after mice were given LPS (i.t. 3 mg/kg), mice were then euthanized 16 h later using pentobarbital. these compounds varied in their ability to ameliorate lavage cytokines, protein concentration, and total cell counts from LPS-treated mice. yed for IL6 and TNF cytokine levels exhibited high potency in vivo. all inhibitors exhibited high potency in vivo. mice were challenged with H1N1 (105 pfu/mouse, i.t.) without (vehicle control) or with C6, C7, C9, or C13 treatment (30 g/ml added to drinking water containing 2% sucrose: estimated dose = 5 mg/kg/d) the tested compounds significantly improved the survival of mice infected with H1N1 compared with mice receiving diluent. the data represent n = 4\u20136 mice/group, *P0.05 versus vehicle. cAMP controls inflammation through several distinct pathways, including cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels, cAMP-activated protein kinases (PKA), or exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (Epac) [27]. cAMP actives PKA, negatively regulates NF-KB pathway, thus suppressing the release of proinflammatory mediators. lignan Forsythin is a weak but selective inhibitor of PDE4. o-linked -D-glucopyranosided lignan forsythin is a weak but selective inhibitor of PDE4. in vitro, forsythin is >80 times weaker in activity toward PDE4 compared with compound 6. our pulmonary viral infection model was complemented with a murine sepsis model to provide assessment of PDE4 inhibitors on systemic inflammation by the endotoxin LPS [37], [38]. in each of these models, our PDE4 inhibitors (Compound 6, 7, 9, 13) were observed to lessen severity of tissue injury using varying modes of application (parenteral, oral), and none of the animals treated with the agents exhibited overt signs of distress. mice were euthanized using i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg pentobarbital. mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine and xylazine. mice were given 100 g of LPS (E. coli) through an i.p. injection. male C57LB/6 mice were acclimated at the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care Facility. male C57LB/6 Mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (80 to 100 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) 50 ul of H1N1 (A/PR/8/34, 105 pfu/mouse) was instilled i.t. for compound treatment, a stock solution (5 mg/ml) was added to the drinking water (containing 2% sucrose) to a final concentration of 30 g/ml. mice that lost >20% weight were immediately euthanized and recorded as deceased. 7.5 ul of test compounds were added to the PDE enzyme with the final concentrations in each assay of 100, 10, 1, 0.1, 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 M. reactions were terminated using 12.5 ul of PDE-Glo Termination Buffer. mice were acclimated at the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care Facility. mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (80 to 100 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) male C57LB/6 mice were acclimated at the University of Pittsburgh Animal Care Facility. mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (80 to 100 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) and xylazine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) male C57LB/6 Mice were deeply anesthetized with ketamine (80 to 100 mg/kg of body weight, intraperitoneally [i.p.]) 50 ul of H1N1 (A/PR/8/34, 105 pfu/mouse) was instilled i.t. for compound treatment, a stock solution (5 mg/ml) was added to the drinking water. mice that lost >20% weight and moribund were immediately euthanized and recorded as deceased. 10 mU of purified human recombinant PDE4A4 (Millipore) was added to 96 well plate. all test compounds were dissolved in DMSO and a serial dilution (110) of the inhibitors were performed using 1X PDE-Glo Reaction buffer. reactions were terminated using 12.5 ul of PDE-Glo Termination Buffer. TNF cytokine releases were monitored by ELISA. % of TNF secretion were calculated and graphed."}
