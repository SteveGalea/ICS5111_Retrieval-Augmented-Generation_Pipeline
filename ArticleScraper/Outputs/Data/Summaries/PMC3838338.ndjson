{"summary": "equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is a member of the genus Lentivirus, family Retroviridae. its structure is the simplest out of all the known lentiviruses. studies of the role of viral receptors in the invasion of the virus are important to the development of antiviral reagents and vaccines. alterative splicing of mRNAs during maturation of eukaryotic pro-mRNA is another mechanism for the formation of soluble receptors. the translation of receptor mRNA can be prematurely terminated due to alterative splicing, which produces receptors that lack the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains [6], [7], [9] soluble viral receptors are functionally important for viral infections [10]\u2013[13]. animals were infected with EIAV in a previous study. animals infected with pathogenic EIAV strains were euthanized at the end of experiment. bDNA assay is a sandwich nucleic acid hybridization assay. mRNA molecules are captured through cooperative hybridization of multiple probes. bDNA assays are not susceptible to contamination risks associated with PCR. the fusion fragment was linked to the 3\u2032 of the ELR1 cDNA for the detection of the expressed recombinant ELR1. both of these PCR products were digested with EcoRI and HindIII. both of these PCR products were inserted into the pcDNA3.1 (+) vector (Invitrogen, USA) at the same cloning sites. transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. cells were blocked with PBS/FISH GELATIN (5%) for 2 h. reacted with anti-HA monoclonal Ab for 1 h. then incubated with an anti-mouse IgG-fluorescein isothiocyanate. cell-free culture medium was collected at 1, 3, 5 and 7 days post-infection (dpi) the strain incubated with the culture medium of cells transfected with the empty pcDNA3.1 vector was used as the control for non-specific bindings. the effect of sELR1 overexpression on the EIAV infection of target cells sELR1 was transiently overexpressed in FED cells. the -actin mRNA levels were calculated by dividing the receptor copy number by the -actin copy number. the plasmid was serially diluted from 1108 to 1102 copies/ml and then measured using real-time PCR. horse peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated from 200\u2013300 ml horse peripheral blood taken from the jugular vein by veterinarians. animals infected with pathogenic EIAV strains were euthanized at the end of experiment or when demonstrated severe disease-associated symptoms resulting in distress. bDNA assays are not susceptible to contamination risks associated with PCR-based assays. mRNA molecules are captured through cooperative hybridization of multiple probes. bDNA assays are therefore not susceptible to contamination risks. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-tagged ELR1 and ELR1-IN using polyJet transfection reagents. transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. sELR1 was transiently expressed in 293T cells by transfection of expression plasmid pcDNA3.1-ELR1-IN. the virus that were pre-incubated with sELR1 were then added to eMDMs in 6-well plates. the mRNA levels of ELR1 and ELR1-IN in equine MDMs infected with EIAV were determined using quantitative real-time PCR. the expression levels of ELR1 and ELR1-IN were normalized to that of the -actin mRNA. cDNA sample was added to a 20 l reaction mixture containing 12.5 l SYBR Green PCR Master mix and 3 M of each primer. the amplification protocol was as follows: 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s and 65\u00b0C for 30 s. a 501 bp fragment from intron 3 of the equine MHC-I gene was amplified from both mRNA samples without or without DNase pre-treatment. as a control, we confirmed that a 501 bp fragment from intron 3 of the equine MHC-I gene was amplified from the DNA preparation without DNase treatment. the amplified ELR1 cDNA fragments were separated by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and the average light unit of ELR1-IN mRNA was 1,594 while that of the blank control was 53.5. all three major variants of ELR1 mRNA were found in all the horses and at all the time points examined. however, the ratios of each isoform varied among the different horses and at the different sampling times. the amino acid sequences of ELR1 and its splicing variants ELR1-IN and ELR1-DE were predicted and aligned. there are two presumed ORFs, ELR1-DE1 and ELR1-DE2, for the ELR1-DE isoform. all the insertions and deletions resulted in a shift of the open reading frame (ORF) sELR1 was expressed as a fusion protein with an HA tag at the C-terminus. presence in the cell lysate or in the culture medium was examined by Western blot using an anti-HA antibody. -actin was applied as the internal control protein. expressing cells were markedly weaker than that of the GFP-ELR1-expressing cells, indicating a dramatic reduction in intracellular accumulation of GFP-sELR1 relative to GFP-ELR1. a live cell imaging of the dynamic expression and distribution of the GFP-ELR1 and GFP-sELR1 was taken. sELR1 is expressed as a soluble protein and can be secreted out of the cell. but some molecules of this soluble form of receptor are associated with the cell surface membrane. the ability of sELR1 to inhibit EIAV infection on target cells is the most important characteristic of the soluble receptor studied here. the soluble receptor was overexpressed in 293T cells by transfection with the pcDNA3.1-ELR1-IN expression vector for 48 hours. the cells were then infected with EIAV 24 h after the transfection. sELR1 interacted with sELR1 in vitro, significantly blocking the subsequent infection of target cells. the presence of sELR1 in the culture medium was confirmed by Western blot. there was no -actin detected in the medium, which ruled out the possibility that these soluble receptor molecules were leaked from broken cells. sELR1 was overexpressed in FED cells by transfection with the empty vector pcDNA3.1. both the ELR1 and sELR1-IN levels showed no apparent change or a slight decrease during the 4 to 12 h post-infection. however, a notable increase was observed for the ELR1 and sELR1 mRNAs in cells infected with EIAV for 3 and 5 d when compared with the untreated controls. a 501 bp fragment from intron 3 of the equine MHC-I gene was amplified from both mRNA samples with or without DNase pre-treatment. a 501 bp fragment from intron 3 of the equine MHC-I gene was amplified from the DNA preparation without or without DNase pre-treatment. as a control, we confirmed that a 501 bp fragment from intron 3 of the equine MHC- the presence of ELR1-IN mRNA was further measured by a bDNA assay. the average light unit of ELR1-IN mRNA was 1,594 while that of the blank control was 53.5. variants were examined by cloning and sequencing the cDNA fragments from the PBMCs of three horses. the ratios of three major ELR1 splicing variants, ELR1, ELR1-IN and ELR1-DE, were analyzed and compared. the shaded form indicates the predominant isoform of ELR1-IN or ELR1-DE. an sELR1-HA fusion protein was overexpressed in 293T cells. the 26 kDa sELR1-HA protein was detected in both the cell lysate and the culture medium. as a control, membrane-associated ELR1-HA was detected only in the cell lysate. both sELR1 and ELR1 were transiently overexpressed in 293T cells with green fluorescence protein (GFP) fused at the N-terminus. the fluorescence intensity of the GFP-sELR1-expressing cells was markedly weaker than that of the GFP-ELR1-expressing cells. a live cell imaging of the dynamic expression and distribution of sELR1 was taken. sELR1 is expressed as a soluble protein and can be secreted out of the cell. sELR1 is expressed as a soluble protein and can be secreted out of the cell. the ability of sELR1 to inhibit EIAV infection is the most important characteristic of the soluble receptor studied here. soluble receptor was overexpressed in 293T cells by transfection with pcDNA3.1-ELR1-IN expression vector for 48 hours. soluble receptor was overexpressed in 293T cells by transfection with the pcDNA3.1-ELR1-IN expression vector for 48 hours. soluble form of sELR1 tagged with HA was overexpressed in FED cells. sELR1 was overexpressed in FED cells by transfection with the pcDNA3.1-ELR1-IN expression vector. the cells were then infected with EIAV 24 h after the transfection. the results revealed that EIAV replicated at a significantly slower rate in the cells transfected with the sELR1 expression vector. the level of ELR1 expression varied in different hosts and at different detection times. we tested the effect of EIAV infection on the expression of the membrane-associated and soluble forms of ELR1. both the ELR1 and sELR1 mRNAs showed no apparent change or a slight decrease during the 4 to 12 h post-infection. eukaryotes are alternatively spliced into several forms. the percentage of these genes can be as high as 93% in humans. the predominant isoform produces a functional ELR1 is a species of 942 bp. the soluble protein encoded by ELR1-IN was confirmed to be a soluble receptor by several different approaches. soluble viral receptors can block HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection in human lymphoma cell lines, but it enhances SIVagm infection in these cell lines by 10 to 100-fold. studies on the mechanisms regulating the formation of soluble viral receptors should lead to a better understanding of the cellular responses to invading viruses. soluble receptors in the plasma can be considered markers of disease progression, such as soluble TNF receptor (sTNFR) II and soluble IL-2 and IL-6 receptors in HIV-1-infected patients [10], [14], [32]. sELR1 is a member of the TNFR superfamily, known to have important roles in regulating immune responses and inducing pathological outcomes. previous studies have shown that plasma TNF concentration is positively correlated with the clinical symptoms of EIAV-infected horses. the intensity of sELR1-GFP in cells was examined by flow cytometry. the GFP-tagged ELR1 was also expressed and analyzed in parallel. all experiments were performed for three times, and a representative result is shown."}
