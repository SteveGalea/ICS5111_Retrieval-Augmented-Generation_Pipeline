{"summary": "the presence of DVGs correlates with enhanced antiviral immune responses during RSV infection [6] and reduced disease severity in influenza virus infection [8]. cbDVGs are common products of non-segmented negative sense (nns) RNA virus replication, including Sendai virus (SeV), measles virus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) cbDVGs have long been thought to result from errors made by the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) during replication due to lack of proofreading activity. no pattern or specific sequences for the break and rejoin points of cbDVGs have been reported so far. cbDVG junction sequences are absent in the full-length viral genome. cbDVG junction sequences become continuous and form the new cbDVG junction sequence when the viral polymerase (Vp) is released from the template and rejoins in the nascent strand. colored nucleotides beneath colored nucleotides represent the consensus sequences of cbDVG junction identified by VODKA. the size of the letter represents the degree of conservation at the site and if there were mutations at a certain position the most representative nucleotide was listed on top. black nucleotides beneath colored nucleotides indicate the sequence of the region obtained by Sanger sequencing. 98,543 out of 98,626 (99.9%) cbDVG junction reads identified by VODKA from an RNA-seq data set. each read that aligned to a break or rejoin region contained two portions. the aligned reads in the break region and in the rejoin region corresponded to the sequence before the break point and after the rejoin point. the presence of cbDVGs in these infections was confirmed using a specific RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. cbDVG rejoin points from stock7 were located within the strongest rejoin hotspot, whereas its four break points were distributed more broadly across the genome. minigenome system included the reporter gene mKate2 for flow cytometry quantification of transcripts produced by the viral polymerase. the goal was to establish whether sequences in the candidate break and rejoin regions altered the polymerase elongation capacity, eventually leading to the generation of cbDVGs. mKate2 promoter, hammerhead ribozyme, complementary sense RSV leader sequence, NS1 non-coding sequence, gene encoding mKate2 [45], L gene start sequence (GS), L gene end sequence (GE), restriction enzyme sites, complementary sense trailer sequence (TrC), hepatitis delta virus ribozyme, and T7 terminator. BSR-T7 cells were transfected with all 4 helper plasmids. mKate2 expression was measured by flow cytometry. the quantification of all repeats is shown as a percentage in D. cbDVG rejoin points fall into a discrete region of the viral genome, which is critical for cbDVG generation. cbDVG rejoin points were identified from in vitro infected cells. in1 + early trailer region of the genome was highly enriched with DVG rejoin points relative to other regions in the RSV genome. we then examined which specific features within this region impacted cbDVG formation. nucleotide composition may play a role in directing cbDVG formation. cbDVG-like fragments generated in mutant GC>Us and mutant AU>GCs were detected by RT-PCR using the DI-F1 and DI-R primer set. grey shade marks the area where mutants GC>Us, C186U, and AU, did not have the rejoin points. cbDVG-like fragments generated in mutants C188U, C186U, and AU were detected by DVG specific RT-PCR using the indicated primers. cbDVG-like fragments generated in mutants C188U, C186U, and AU were detected by DVG specific RT-PCR using the indicated primers. in1 alone examined mKate2 expression by flow cytometry. neither of these constructs reduced mKate2 expression compared to BKB. this suggests that the function of the RSV minigenome system remained intact despite of the mutations. gRSV-FR-GC>Us mutant virus harboring mutations identical to the GC>Us minigenome construct. the backbone of the recombinant RSV (Line 19) included the mKate2 gene and we used mKate2 expression to estimate its replication. both viruses began to generate cbDVGs at passage 3 (P3). hep2 cells were infected with gRSV-FR-WT-P3 and gRSV-FR-GC>Us-P3 at MOI of 1.5. cbDVG detection from P2, P3, and P5 of gRSV-FR-WT and gRSV-FR-GC>Us via DVG specific RT-PCR using the DI1/DI-R primer set. gRSV-FR-GC->Us are strain line19. the majority of rejoin points found in infection with gRSV-FR-WT. gRSV-FR-WT generates more cbDVGs at this location than RSV stocks1-7. the most abundant cbDVG again had the rejoin point within the \u201cRejoin1+Trailer\u201d region, similar to that identified in in vitro infections. the most abundant cbDVG again had the rejoin point within the \u201cRejoin1+Trailer\u201d region. pediatric patients with low content of DVGs and 6 with high content of DVGs were selected for RNA-seq. all seq reads that passed the quality threshold were analyzed by VODKA to screen for cbDVG junctions. the number on the right side of the graph represents the total reads at any given position of the RSV reference genome. high sensitivity detection of cbDVG populations during infection. we developed an algorithm to identify cbDVG junction regions in RNA-seq datasets. cbDVG junction sequences are absent in the full-length viral genome. the viral polymerase (Vp) is released from the template and rejoins in the nascent strand. VODKA identified hotspots for polymerase break and rejoin during cbDVG formation. the size of the letter represents the degree of conservation at the site. black nucleotides beneath colored nucleotides indicate the sequence of the DVG-546 junction region obtained by Sanger sequencing. the grey boxed areas in the graphs mark the region after the rejoin point and the pink boxed area the DVG region before the break point. 98,543 out of 98,626 (99.9%) cbDVG junction reads identified by VODKA from an RNA-seq data set. each read that aligned to a break or rejoin region contained two portions. each read that aligned to a break or rejoin region contained two portions. the presence of cbDVGs in these infections was confirmed using a specific RT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. we compared these break and rejoin hotspots to those generated in infections with a different stock of RSV enriched in cbDVGs (stock7) from which the major cbDVGs were identified. mKate2 expression should only occur if the viral polymerase replicates the entire minigenome sequence from the trailer to the leader. in this system mKate2 expression should only occur if the viral polymerase replicates the entire minigenome sequence from the trailer to the leader. hammerhead ribozyme, complementary sense RSV leader sequence, NS1 gene start sequence, NS1 non-coding sequence, gene encoding mKate2 [45], L gene start sequence (GS), L gene end sequence (GE), restriction enzyme sites, complementary sense trailer sequence (TrC), hepatitis delta virus ribozyme. a representative plot of mKate2 expression determined by flow cytometry is shown. mKate2 expression was measured by flow cytometry. the quantification of repeats is shown as a percentage in D. cbDVG rejoin points fall into a discrete region of the viral genome. Fig 3. Identification of one conserved genomic region critical for cbDVG rejoin. cbDVG rejoin points fall into a discrete region of the viral genome. this region is within one of most A and U enriched areas of the RSV genome. we chose to mutate six nucleotides at the beginning of this rejoin region. we then used RT-PCR (DI-1/DI-R primer set) to detect cbDVG-like fragments. cbDVG-like fragments generated in mutant GC>Us and mutant AU>GCs were detected by RT-PCR using the DI-F1 and DI-R primer set. grey shade marks the area where mutants GC>Us, C186U, and AU, did not have the rejoin points. cbDVG fragments generated in mutants C188U, C186U, and AU were detected by DVG specific RT-PCR using the indicated primers. band labeled with an asterisk was confirmed not to be a DVG product. to rule out bias due to primer location, we designed two additional forward primers to detect cbDVG-like fragments. neither of these constructs reduced mKate2 expression compared to BKB. this suggests that the function of the RSV minigenome system remained intact despite of the mutations. gRSV-FR-GC>Us is identified as gRSV-FR-GC>Us. the backbone of the recombinant RSV (Line 19) included the mKate2 gene and we used mKate2 expression to estimate its replication. both viruses began to generate cbDVGs at passage 3 (P3) and the pattern of cbDVGs was maintained by P5. hep2 cells were infected with gRSV-FR-WT-P3 and gRSV-FR-GC>Us-P3 at MOI of 1.5. cbDVG detection from P2, P3, P4, and P5 of gRSV-FR-WT and gRSV-FR-GC>Us via DVG specific RT-PCR using the DI1/DI-R primer set. arrows indicated the rejoin points of cbDVGs detected from viruses. the majority of rejoin points found in infection with gRSV-FR-GC->Us. gRSV-FR-WT generated more cbDVGs at this location than RSV A2 stocks1-7. the most abundant cbDVG again had the rejoin point within the \u201cRejoin1+Trailer\u201d region. the most abundant cbDVG again had the rejoin point within the \u201cRejoin1+Trailer\u201d region, despite of a higher diversity of rejoin points compared to in vitro infection. seq reads that passed the quality threshold were analyzed by VODKA to screen for cbDVG junctions. the number on the right side of the graph represents the total reads at any given position of the RSV reference genome. the number on the right side of the graph represents the total reads at any given position. cbDVGs were thought to result from random errors introduced by the viral polymerase during replication. but mounting evidence indicates that the generation of cbDVGs is not totally stochastic. cbDVGs are critical regulators of viral replication and pathogenesis in multiple RNA virus infections. a specific sequence involved in cbDVG formation opens the unprecedented possibility of genetically manipulating the content of cbDVGs during infection. we used a custom-designed algorithm, VODKA, to identify cbDVGs in infections in vitro or from children naturally infected with RSV. cleotide substitution alone can influence the location of the rejoin point. the total amount of cbDVGs produced and their immunostimulatory activity are not necessarily altered by the single C substitution in one rejoin hotspot. the same differential distribution of cbDVG rejoin points was observed when we compared cbDVG generation from infections with RSV A2 and Line19. cbDVGs generated in vitro do not follow the rule of six or seven. cbDVGs with certain length may have increased replication efficiency. cbDVGs with certain length may have increased replication efficiency. the current work represents a major paradigm shift with the identification of sequences that regulate cbDVG formation. despite the potential importance of these additional factors on DVG generation, the current work represents a major paradigm shift with the identification of sequences that regulate cbDVG formation. all studies on DVG biology have been correlative in nature. all cell lines were treated with mycoplasma removal agent (MP Biomedicals) the stock used in these experiments had a high infectious to total particle ratio of 500:15,000. the stock used in these experiments had a high infectious to total particle ratio of 500:15,000. pair1 and Rejoin1 mutations were introduced using the site-directed mutagenesis commercial kit QuickChange II XL (Agilent, CA) all primers used for cloning are listed in S1 Table. the temperature cycle parameters used for the cbDVG-PCR in a BioRad C1000 Thermal Cycler were 95\u00b0C for 10 min and 33\u201335 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 sec, 55\u00b0C for 30 sec and 72\u00b0C for 90 sec.
