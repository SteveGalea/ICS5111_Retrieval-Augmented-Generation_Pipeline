{"summary": "the liver has the ability to synthesize a wide variety of proteins, perform various posttranslational modifications, and secrete them into the blood. cationic liposomes are used for transfection and interact with plasmid DNA to give a lipoplex. AF is a glycoprotein that possesses three asparagine-linked triantennary complex carbohydrate chains with terminal N-acetylgalactosamine residues. hepatocytes are cyclic (-1,4)-linked oligosaccharides of -D-glucopyranose containing a hydrophobic central cavity and hydrophilic outer surface. they are known to be able to act as novel host molecules by chemical modification [17] pegylated liposomes entrapping the doxorubicin complex with -CyD in mice bearing Colon-26 tumor cells showed DOX accumulation in tumor tissues and the potent antitumor effect. these lines of evidence suggest transfection efficiency and pharmacokinetics of pDNA can be altered by the association of CyDs with AF-liposomes.

AF-liposomes and gene transfer activity of pDNA/AF-liposomes were raised. pDNA/AF-liposome was prepared using a freeze-thaw method. cells were incubated with pDNA/-CyDs/AF-liposome for 3 h in FCS-free medium. no significant change in DSC thermographs was observed in the presence of HP--CyD (Figure 9(b)). this results suggest that -CyD may affect the membrane fluidity of N-liposomes. the Hcal value of DLPC-liposomes in the -CyD system was drastically elevated at 20 mM of -CyD. however, in the case of HP--CyD, there was no significant change in DSC thermograms, phase transition temperature, and the Hcal values. -CyD enhances the lipid-lipid interaction of DLPC-liposomes. pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes can be internalized into HepG2 cells to a larger extent compared to pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes. pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes can be internalized into HepG2 cells to a larger extent. calcein leakage in the presence of -CyD and three types of HP-CyDs was low even at the concentration of 20 mM CyDs. the interaction of -CyD and HP-CyDs with AF-liposomes was weaker than that of -CyD and DM--CyD. the gene transfer activity of pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes in HepG2 cells was significantly higher than that of pDNA/HP--, HP--, and HP--CyDs/AF-liposomes. as predicted, -CyD significantly increased the luciferase expression, but HP--CyD did not, suggesting that -CyD is involved in the enhancing effect on luciferase expression at liposomes or pDNA/-CyDs/AF-liposomes were added to AF-liposomes suspension before freeze-drying. the concentration of CyD was 1 M/M lipids. cells were incubated for 3 h in

hepatocyte-selective gene transfer activity and negligible cytotoxicity, compared to pDNA/AF-liposomes and pDNA/HP-CyDs/AF-liposomes. cationic liposomes composed of TMAG/DOPE/DLPC are commercially available transfection reagents as GeneTransfer. the most important finding found in the present study is that -CyD enhances transfection efficiency of pDNA/AF-liposomes in HepG2 cells with negligible cytotoxicity. the encapsulation ratio of pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes should be involved in the enhancing effect of -CyD on gene transfer activity of AF-liposomes. the particle size of pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes was decreased in the presence of -CyD, although the -potential value of pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes was almost equivalent to that of pDNA pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes and encapsulation ratio of pDNA into pDNA/-CyD/AF-liposomes are crucial role for enhancing transfection efficiency of pDNA/AF-liposomes. the important question regarding the enhancing effect of -CyD on transfection efficiency of pDNA/AF-liposomes remains, because three types of HP-CyDs did not have the enhancing effect. the physical mixture of pDNA/-CyD and -CyD in culture medium had no enhancing effect on transfection efficiency of pDNA/AF-liposomes. therefore, encapsulation of -CyD into AF-liposomes may be pivotal for enhancing gene transfer activity. further elaborate study should be necessary to reveal the detailed mechanism for the enhancing effect of -CyD associated in AF-liposomes on transfection efficiency."}
