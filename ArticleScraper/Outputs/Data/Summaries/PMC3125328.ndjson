{"summary": "scFvs were able to recognise as low as 31 ng of protein of their respective targets. the scFvs were able to recognise as low as 31 ng of protein of their respective targets by western blot. the development of recombinant antibodies in single-chain Fv formats is a good alternative to obtain high-affinity antibodies against any target without time-consuming immunization [11-14] the affinity of scFvs for their targets might be comparable to that of mAbs or pAbs and in some cases even higher [15] cell-free expression is a powerful and flexible technology. new advances in this technology have faced the higher demand for high-throughput protein synthesis. these advances include the use of cell-extracts from different backgrounds. 13364 human proteins detected soluble proteins in 12682 out of 13364 clones. there have been other successful high-throughput initiatives based on in vitro protein expression. the microarray format is particularly useful for low consumption and automation. ELISA characterization of polyclonal phages after different rounds of biopanning. a peroxidase-labeled anti-His was followed by TMB incubation. a remarkable phage enrichment for both proteins was observed. scFv antibody microarrays reproducibility was determined by printing serial 1:10 dilutions of previously reported anti-gastrin TA4 scFv at 0.5 g/ml to construct a regression line [40] the quality of the scFv antibody microarray was confirmed by the absence of cross contamination between successive spots. all positive controls as well as buffer spots showed the correct reactivity. scFv antibody microarrays tested 384 recombinant scFvs. scFvs were labeled with 647 Alexa Fluor at 1 g/mL. scFvs were also used as controls for selection of highly-specific scFvs. anti-GFP scFv clones were tested by ELISA using GFP and GST to compare the microarray technology with ELISA screening. white boxes: 8 reactive scFv antibodies detected by antibody microarrays against Trx showing at least 3-fold higher fluorescence signal. ELISA tested all the scFv binders for each antigen by ELISA. by antibody microarrays, we found 10 GFP-specific scFvs with 3-fold higher signals than the negative controls. by ELISA, we found 13 scFvs with at least 2-fold higher signals than the negative controls. the two scFvs that showed strong recognition by antibody microarrays were also the best for ELISA. however, Trx-E10 scFv showed a lower correlation between antibody microarrays and ELISA values. scFvs were able to detect as low as 31.3 ng of protein by western-blot. scFvs showed 2-4 times lower sensitivity to Trx than M2 mAb to the Flag epitope. all the scFvs-encoding DNA sequences were different. ELISA characterization of the polyclonal phages after different rounds of biopanning. a peroxidase-labeled anti-M13 was followed by TMB incubation. TALON Dynabeads\u00ae were divided in five tubes with 10 L of beads. the intra-assay reproducibility was assessed by comparing the results between the two replicas printed within the same chip for each clone. controls used in the assay were: red box, mAb anti-T7Tag, 1:10 diluted. yellow box, mAb anti-T7Tag, 1:10 diluted. in our microarrays, 384 recombinant scFvs were simultaneously tested. the scFvs obtained against each other antigen were also used as controls for the selection of highly-specific scFvs. cell free-expressed proteins were labeled with 647 AlexaFluor. anti-Trx scFv clones were tested by ELISA using Trx, GST-His6 tagged and BSA to compare the performance of the microarray technology. arrows indicate the top three scFvs that gave the highest microarray signal for GFP or Trx. ELISA found 13 scFvs with at least 2-fold higher signals than the negative controls. by antibody microarrays, we also found 8 scFvs with 3-fold higher signals than the negative controls. scFvs were tested by ELISA to compare their reactivity against each in vitro-expressed antigen. Selected scFvs were tested by ELISA against the cell free-expressed proteins, E. coli-derived GFP and scFv-Trx 3xFlag proteins, using BSA and GST as negative controls. different amounts of GFP or scFv-Trx were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes to determine the sensitivity of the target proteins. discussion Antibodies are used to study protein expression and localization within a tissue, cell or organelle, protein-protein interactions or protein function. to study and characterize the human proteome, it is necessary to establish high-throughput methodologies for testing multiple antibodies against different proteins. a dedicated person could produce antibodies in about 4 weeks, calculating 5 working days per week. in vitro protein expression, phage display libraries and antibody microarrays could be adapted to a high-throughput system. the in vitro technology has minimized these limitations by including several components, like canine pancreatic microsomal membranes and different DTT ratios. scFvs were prepared by using a nave scFv phage display library. only 5 g of cell-free expressed protein and a naive scFv antibody library. scFvs were useful for different applications (ELISA, antibody microarrays and western blot) in vitro protein expression, purification and characterization Plasmids pET32b-Trx or pIVEX-GFP were used in the cell free transcription/translation system to produce Trx or GFP. RTS reactions containing DNA template in 50 L of solution were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 6 h at 300 rpm. 10-3F containing the cDNA encoding the scFv-Trx were used to transform BL21 (DE3) E. coli cells. selection of protein-specific scFvs from phagemid libraries were performed using the proteins attached to TALON Dynabeads. phages were eluted with 100 L of 0.1M glycine, pH 2.7. phages were neutralized with 20 L of 1M Tris, pH 9. amplification of the phages during the four rounds of biopanning was performed. supernatant containing phage suspension was mixed with 4 g of PEG-8000 (Sigma) and 3 g of NaCl (Merck) until complete dissolution. then, phages were centrifuged at 15000 g for 15 min and 4\u00b0C. then, phages were resuspended in 2 mL of 1% BSA (Sigma) in PBS. anti-T7 mouse monoclonal antibody (0.1 mg/mL, Novagen) and 1:10 fold dilutions starting at 0.1 mg/mL of TA4 scFv were used as positive controls. slides were printed at 20\u00b0C and 45% of humidity using a microarrayer. antibodies (1 g/mL, Roche) were added for 1 h at room temperature. microarrays were air dried and scanned as described below. slides were incubated with rabbit polyclonal anti-GFP or monoclonal anti-Flag. cDNA encoding scFvs was amplified using an initial denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 1 min at 94\u00b0C, 1 min at 55\u00b0C and 1 min at 72\u00b0C. exonuclease I (USB) and shrimp alkaline phosphatase (USB) were added to the PCR products to remove any contaminant. peroxidase-conjugated anti-His6 or scFv-Trx control proteins were detected with the corresponding scFvs at 100 ng/mL concentration. the signal was developed using an anti-c-myc tag (1 g/mL, Roche) followed by peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse IgG (0.2 g/mL, Sigma) BSA (Sigma), E. coli-expressed GFP-His6 (GE) and an irrelevant scFv fused to Trx (3xFlag, His6-tagged) proteins were produced in E. coli according to established procedures. magnetic beads were blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. each round of selection included a negative subtraction of the phages against empty TALONTM Dynabeads\u00ae. each round of selection included a negative subtraction of the phages against empty TALONTM Dynabeads\u00ae. 12 L of 5 mg/mL tetracycline were added to the cell culture. 2.4 L of 100 mg/mL carbenicillin (Sigma) were added to the 8-mL cell culture. 1 mL VCSM13 helper phage (1012 to 1013 pfu) was added to the cell culture. cultures were diluted 1:100 in 96-well plates containing 200 L of 2xTY, 100 g/ml ampicillin and 0.1% glucose. cells were spun down, resuspended in 100 l TES (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 20% sucrose) scFv microarray processing and data acquisition Cell-free expressed GFP and Trx were labelled with a 647Alexa Fluor \"Microscale Protein Labelling\" kit. proteins attached to TALONTM Dynabeads\u00ae were eluted with 50 mM phosphate buffer, 0.3M NaCl, 150 mM imidazole pH 8.0. slides were incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG antibodies (1 g/mL) microarrays were air dried and scanned with the ScanArrayTM 5000 (Packard BioChip Technologies) using 635 nm and 532 nm lasers for Alexa 647 and Alexa 555. sequencing was carried out in an ABI7002 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems) peroxidase-labelled anti-M13 (1:5000 dilution in 2% MPBS) or anti-c-myc (1 g/mL, Roche) were added for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the reaction was stopped with 1M H2SO4 and absorption measured at 450 nm.
