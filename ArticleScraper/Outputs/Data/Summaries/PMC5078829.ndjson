{"summary": "simian type 2 picornavirus and duck picornavirus TW90A have a unique genomic organization different from other picornavirus genera. SV-A can cause asymptomatic and symptomatic diseases in both field and experimental pigs. symptomatic disorders include diarrhoea, pneumonia, polioencephalomyelitis and reproductive disorders. experimental studies have demonstrated a diverse range of clinical symptoms. differences largely depend on age, route of infection and strains inoculated. significant antigenic diversity has been observed in SV-As isolated from different countries and continents. SV-A can recognize a2,3-linked sialic acid (SA) on GD1a as a functional SV-A receptor. a2,3-linked SA is known to be highly expressed on cells of porcine and avian origin. a2,3-linked SA is known to be highly expressed on cells of porcine and avian origin. strain had continuous diarrhoea from 1 to 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) however, diarrhoea was not observed in mock- or SV-A-inoculated chicks during the entire experimental period. high viral RNA levels were detected in faecal samples collected from piglets at 1 dpi, reaching a peak at 3 dpi followed by decreasing viral loads from 5 dpi. SV-A infection resulted in histopathological changes in the small intestines of virus-inoculated piglets. large intestinal lesions, including crypt fusion with epithelial cell hyperplasia, were observed at 2 dpi, increased until 5 dpi followed by a decrease at 7 dpi. adaptive immune reactions to SV-A infection evident as perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes and gliosis were observed Piglet no. dpi at euthanasia Duodenum Jejunum Ileum Lesion score* Antigen distribution Lesion score Antigen distribution Lesion score Antigen distribution Lesion score Antigen distribution 1\u20133 1 3.60.53 3.30.61 2.10.4 2.40.55 2.30.58 1.60.51 4\u20136 3 3.60.36 31.11 3.40.51 2.70.58 2.80.7 2.30.42 7\u20139 5 2.90.47 1.20. antigen distribution in the small intestine was evaluated based on the number of antigen-positive cells in the villi as follows: 0, no positive cells; 1, one to two positive cells in the villi; 2, three to five positive cells scattered in the villi; 4, positive in almost all epithelial cells in the tip and upper part of the villi.

SV-A induced viraemia, which was then disseminated to extra-intestinal organs and tissues in piglets but not chicks. the binding and infection ability of SV-A was examined with various cell lines, including porcine, human, chicken embryo, canine, simian, hamster and feline. SV-A strain caused diarrhoea and faecal viral shedding in piglets. chicken cells are typically rich in 2,3-linked SA, whereas porcine cells are abundant in both 2,3- and 2,6-linked SAs. compared to mock inoculation, piglets inoculated with SV-A strain had continuous diarrhoea from 1 to 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) high viral RNA levels were detected in faecal samples collected from piglets at 1 dpi, reaching a peak at 3 dpi followed by decreasing viral loads from 5 dpi. however, SV-A RNA was only detected at 1 dpi from faeces of SV-A-inoculated chicks, most likely representing virus inoculum passing through the intestines. large intestinal lesions, including crypt fusion with epithelial cell hyperplasia, were observed at 2 dpi, increased until 5 dpi followed by a decrease at 7 dpi. adaptive immune reactions to SV-A infection evident as perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes and gliosis were observed from 7 dpi until the termination of the experiment. sion score Antigen distribution 1\u20133 1 3.60.53 3.30.61 2.10.4 2.40.55 2.30.58 1.60.51 4\u20136 3 3.60.36 31.11 3.40.51 2.70.58 2.80.7 2.30.42 7\u20139 5 2.90.47 1.20.35 40.29 1.80.4 3.30.46 1.30.25 10\u201312 7 2.30.89 0 3.20.75 0 2.10.65 0 13\u201315 14 0 1, one to two positive cells in the villi; 2, three to five positive cells scattered in the villi; 3, many positive cells in the villi; 4, positive in almost all epithelial cells in the tip and upper part of the villi. small- and large-intestinal tissues collected from mock- or SV-A-inoculated piglets were examined histopathologically and immunohistochemically. 0 0 0 4\u20136 3 0 0 0 7\u20139 5 0 0 0 0 10\u201312 7 11 0 0.70.58 0 13\u201315 14 1.30.58 0 2.30.58 0 19\u201321 21 1.30.58 0 2.30.57 0 22\u201324 28 1.70.58 0 1.30.58 0 25\u201327 5 0 0 0 0 0 0. qRT-PCR assay performed with sera and extra-intestinal organs and tissues collected from mock- or SV-A-inoculated chicks. SV-A RNA levels were relatively low in the serum, spinal cord, lung and brain in comparison with those in the faecal samples collected from SV-A-inoculated piglets and chicks. SV-A was minated to extra-intestinal organs and tissues in piglets but not chicks. binding and infection ability of SV-A was examined with various cell lines. SV-A binds to and infects cells of porcine origin. SV-A infection was limited to cells of porcine origin. it could not infect cells of other origins including chickens and humans. chymotrypsin treatment of cells has no effect on virus infection. the pathogenicity and host range restriction of SV-A have been poorly characterized. the spinal cord and brain mainly showed signs of adaptive immune response (non-suppurative inflammation) and comparatively low viral RNA copy numbers without clear evidence of SV-A antigen-positive cells. this study used neonatal piglets orally inoculated with SV-A strain. SV-A RNA loads were detected in the sera of piglets. this suggests that SV-A might be able to penetrate the gut barrier from the luminal side through destruction of enterocytes in the villi. this result implied that SV-A could reach other organs and tissues via cell-free transmission. human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) and human lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 cells (ATCC) were grown in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 5 % FBS, 100 U ml1 penicillin and 100 g ml1 streptomycin. human lung fibroblast WI-38 cells (ATCC) were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5 % FBS, 100 U ml FITC goat anti-mouse IgG antibody and peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG antibody were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. HRP-conjugated streptavidin was obtained from Jackson Immuno Research Lab. formalin-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned, stained with haematoxylin and eosin and examined microscopically. the distribution of SV-A antigens in tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemical examination using paraffin-embedded sections and an mAb against SV-A capsid protein. -PK cells were purified using caesium chloride (CsCl) gradient centrifugation. cells were harvested at 72 h post inoculation and freeze-thawed three times. cell debris was spun down at 2469 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. Dye-labelled binding assay performed with purified AF-594-labelled viruses. mock-infected or treated cells were inoculated with m.o.i. of 1000 of AF-594-labelled virus. labelling of viruses with [35S]methionine/cysteine (PerkinElmer) was carried out as described previously. purified [35S]methionine/cysteine-labelled virus (50 000 c.p.m.) was incubated with cells on ice for 45 min. cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS followed by cell lysis with 0.1 % SDS and 0.1 M NaOH. mAb against SV-A capsid protein (1 : 40 dilution) was added and incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. cells were then washed three times with PBS-NCS. FITC-conjugated secondary antibody (diluted to 1 : 100) was then added. volume of 20 l containing 10 l of SensiFAST SYBR Lo-ROX One-Step mix (Enzynomics), 0.2 l of reverse transcriptase, 0.4 l of RiboSafe RNase Inhibitor, 0.8 l of PSV2 primer (CTACTCTCCTGTAACCAGT at positions between 153 and 170 of the 5\u2032-UTR), 4 l of template and 3.8 l RNase-free dH our experiment protocol was approved by the Committee on Ethics of Animal Experiments, CNU with permit number of CNU No. 2012-87. all statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version 11.5.1 for Windows (SPSS) one-way ANOVA was used to determine the statistical significance (P0.05) SV-A strain KS04105 was isolated from faecal samples of piglets from south Korea. this strain was passaged eight times in LLC-PK cells. Isolated viruses were confirmed as PSVs based on immunofluorescence assay (IFA), RT-PCR and transmission electron microscopy. piglets and chicks were inoculated with the same volume of medium for mock infection. all animals were fed with sterilized commercialized milk or feed. clinical signs including diarrhoea, pneumonia and convulsions were evaluated daily. all sections were stained with peroxidase-labelled streptavidin\u2013biotin. antigen localization was visualized by incubating the sections with 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine/H2O2 solution. sections were then weakly counterstained with haematoxylin. purified virus in 0.1m sodium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8.3) was labelled with one-tenth-fold molar concentration of AF-594 succinimidyl ester (1 mg at 1 mg ml1 in DMSO) each reaction was mixed thoroughly by vortexing for 30 s. each reaction was mixed thoroughly by vortexing for 30 s and incubated at room temperature for 1 h with continuous stirring. confluent monolayers of cells were infected with SV-A strain KS04105. the medium was replaced with RPMI 1640 lacking methionine and cysteine (Sigma-Aldrich) at 72 h, each labelled virus was purified by CsCl density gradient centrifugation as described above. cells were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 h prior to being fixed with 4 % formaldehyde in PBS. the mAb against SV-A capsid protein was added and incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. each infected cell culture was freeze-thawed three times. cell debris was spun down at 2469 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. each real-time RT-PCR was performed using a Rotor-Gene real-time amplification system. Rotorgene 6000\u00ae (Corbett Research) software was used to calculate the amount of SV-A-specific RNA in the samples. the threshold was defined automatically in the initial exponential phase."}
