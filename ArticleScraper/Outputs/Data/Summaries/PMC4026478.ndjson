{"summary": "influenza viruses are major human pathogens causing annual epidemics and intermittent pandemics with potentially devastating consequences. therapy is available and constitutes the only defense against pandemic influenza, but its efficacy is compromised by resistance development [4], [5] a constraint to influenza virus research is the need to quantify viral titers via time and labor intensive techniques. viral entry is a target for innate, host cell encoded antiviral defenses. IFITM proteins 1, 2 and 3 block influenza A virus infection at the stage of viral entry and polymorphisms in the IFITM3 coding region modulate the susceptibility to disease. modified version of reverse genetics vector pHW2000 [21] allows bi-directional expression of genes and vRNA from cloned influenza virus segments. first, we chose restriction sites for cloning instead of the BsmBI sites. second, we inserted a cassette with the chloramphenicol resistance gene and the negative selection marker ccdB between the AarI sites. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids carrying either wild type segment 8 (lane 1) or segments modified with GFP (lane 2), turbo RFP (lane 3) or Gaussia luciferase (lane 4). NS1 fusion proteins were detected by immunoblot with an antibody directed against NS1. fusion protein in the cell lysates was low compared to wild type NS1 protein and the other fusion proteins. we analyzed luciferase activity from supernatants and cell lysates of 293T cells transfected with control plasmid, the Gaussia reporter construct or the Gaussia reporter construct along with plasmids encoding influenza A replicase proteins. the highest activity was measured in supernatants of cells expressing segment 8 jointly MDCK cells were infected with PR8-NS1-GFP, PR8-NS1-tuRFP and PR8-NS1-tuRFP at MOI 1 and cultivated in the presence and absence of trypsin. supernatants were collected, frozen and measured together. significant amounts of luciferase activity were detected as early as 6 hpi and reached a maximum at 18 hpi. luciferase activity was only detected in supernatants from cells cultivated in the absence of trypsin, suggesting that Gaussia luciferase might be inactivated by trypsin. reporter viruses encoding Gaussia luciferase were passaged in MDCK cells. stocks generated in this way were used to infect MDCK cells. similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. supernatants were collected at several time points up to three days post infection. for each sample luciferase activity and virus titer were determined. this virus is suitable for analyses over a wide range of infectious doses. caco2 cells were infected with a low dose of virus (1000 ffu, MOI 0.004), treated with varying concentrations of NA inhibitor zanamivir and 3 days post infection Gaussia luciferase activity was determined in the supernatants. the EC50 value was calculated to 17 nM, which is in the range known from other studies. inhibitory effects observed upon expression of IFITM1 were minor (A549 and 293T cells) but not in MDCK cells. similar effects were measured upon transduction of IFITM protein expressing 293T cells with a retroviral vector bearing the HA and NA proteins. 293T cells transduced to express IFITM1, 2 or 3 or cat were transduced with reporter pseudoparticles bearing the surface proteins of VSV, MLV, LASV or influenza A virus. luciferase activity encoded by pseudovirus genomes was determined in cell extracts harvested at 72 hours after transduction. antiviral activity of IFITM proteins has been clearly demonstrated in cell culture [17], [35] and in the infected host [36], the mechanisms underlying the antiviral action is less clear. recently, it was proposed that IFITM proteins might impede viral entry by increasing the cholesterol levels in the endosomal compartment [19]. the vector pHW2000-GGAarI was constructed by restriction free cloning [25] and propagated in E. coli DB3.1 bacteria. the entire construct was assembled by PCR as described in the initial report and cloned into pHW2000. 293T cells were transfected with control plasmid (pCAGGS), pHW-NS1-Gluc or pHW-NS1-Gluc and plasmids encoding replicase proteins. at 24 h post transfection, supernatants and cell lysates were analyzed for Gaussia luciferase activity. all three segments encoding different reporter genes allowed reconstitution of infectious virus in the context of A/PR/8/34 (PR8). growth of the three viruses PR8 NS1-GFP, PR8 NS1-tuRFP and PR8 NS1-gluc was analyzed in single step growth curves on MDCK cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (hpi) supernatant containing high Gaussia luciferase activity was incubated with trypsin (1 g/ml) luciferase activity was measured at the indicated intervals. the calculated half-life of luciferase activity is indicated. reporter virus encoding Gaussia luciferase was found in infected cultures. reporter virus encoding Gaussia luciferase was found to be stable. reporter virus encoding Gaussia luciferase was relatively stable. e activities present in culture supernatants at 24 h post infection (C) similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. the gaussia reporter virus is Suitable for antiviral drug testing. luciferase activity was determined in supernatants harvested at 24 h post infection. similar results were obtained in a separate experiment. members of the IFITM protein family, specifically IFITM1, 2 and 3, have been identified as inhibitors of influenza A virus infection [17]. expression of IFITM3 resulted in marked inhibition of PR8-NS1-Gluc infection in all cellular systems tested. no inhibition was measured for pseudoparticles bearing murine leukemia virus envelope protein (MLV) or the Lassa virus (LASV) glycoprotein. results indicate that PR8-NS1-Gluc can be used to determine the antiviral activity of host cell proteins. a549 cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of U18666A. they were then transduced with pseudoparticles bearing influenza A virus HA and NA proteins. similar results were obtained in at least two separate experiments. two recombinant viruses encoded the fluorescent proteins GFP and turbo RFP, while a third encoded Gaussia luciferase. the virus carrying the secreted Gaussia luciferase should allow sensitive detection of infection without the requirement to lyse infected cultures. cloning efficiency of pHW2000-GGAarI and pHW2000-GGAarI was comparable. in the presence of trypsin the half-life of Gaussia luciferase was very short. in the presence of trypsin the half-life of Gaussia luciferase was very short. single cycle experiments can be readily conducted in the absence of trypsin. a different influenza A virus carrying Gaussia luciferase was described and used for in vitro and in vivo characterization of broadly neutralizing antibodies. this virus exhibited stability comparable to PR8-NS1-Gluc. luciferase was connected via a 2A sequence to PB2 and had a KDEL signal for retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. this virus is suitable for in vivo experiments. enzymatic NA assays are better suited than virus growth assays to predict antiviral activity of NAI in the infected host. the virus expressing Gaussia luciferase is able to faithfully replicate observations made in other systems with authentic influenza A virus. influenza A virus (PR8) can infect haploid cell lines deficient in NPC1 [49], [51]. recombinant influenza A virus encoding Gaussia luciferase allows sensitive quantification of infection with minimal manipulation. this virus is genetically stable over several passages and suitable for analysis of the antiviral action of cellular factors or chemical compounds. plasmid encoding segment 8 from strain A/PR/8/34 New York was
