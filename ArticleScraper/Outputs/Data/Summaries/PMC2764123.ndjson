{"summary": "a cross-sectional study was undertaken of 15 children and 13 adults with CF, 26 chronically infected with P aeruginosa. a cough aerosol sampling system enabled fractioning of respiratory particles of different sizes and culture of viable non-fermentative bacteria. inclusion criteria included known pregnancy, pneumothorax within the previous 6 months, history of cough syncope or vomiting associated with coughing. subjects excluded from hypertonic saline inhalation if there was a history of intolerance of hypertonic saline, presence of asthma symptoms or a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 40% predicted. subjects were instructed to cough into the CASS as frequently and as strongly as was comfortable for 5 min. at the onset of coughing the timer controlling the power to the vacuum pump was started. if hypertonic saline could be tolerated, sampling was done with the subject using tidal breathing for 5 min. the indoor air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a thermohygrometer at the beginning of each study. effective air exchange rates in the consultation rooms used for CASS testing and in the pulmonary function laboratory at the adult centre were determined using carbon dioxide as a tracer gas. cepacia complex colonies counted (total count) in all the Andersen stages for 5 min of voluntary coughing. for 5 min hypertonic saline study or tidal breathing was calculated. for air samples and afferent limb cultures, only Gram-negative non-fermentative bacteria were assessed. exclusion criteria included known pregnancy, pneumothorax within the previous 6 months, history of cough syncope or vomiting associated with coughing. subjects excluded from hypertonic saline inhalation if there was a history of intolerance of hypertonic saline, presence of asthma symptoms or a forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 40% predicted. subjects were pretreated with albuterol metered dose inhaler (88 g per puff), 4 puffs via spacer (Volumatic, Allen & Hanburys, UK) if hypertonic saline was not considered safe, sampling was done with the subject. the indoor air temperature and relative humidity were measured with a thermohygrometer (Rotronic HygroPalm 2, Rotronic Instrument Corp, Huntington, New York, USA) at the beginning of each study. effective air exchange rates in the consultation rooms used for CASS testing were determined using carbon dioxide as a tracer gas. the total sum of colonies counted in all the Andersen stages for 5 min of voluntary coughing and for 5 min hypertonic saline study or tidal breathing was calculated. for air samples, afferent limb cultures and air samples Standard quantitative culture methods were used. colonies counted for 5 min of voluntary coughing and 5 min hypertonic saline study or tidal breathing. paired differences between counts during voluntary coughing and each of the hypertonic and tidal breathing studies were logarithmically transformed before analysis to correct for skewness. results CASS studies Twenty-eight subjects (15 children, 13 adults) were recruited and completed 5 min of voluntary coughing. one subject performed the voluntary cough only. all adults (n = 12) and 14 children had chronic infection based on the Leeds criteria. one child had recently cleared a new infection with P aeruginosa following an eradication course of antibiotic therapy. one subject cultured B cenocepacia as expected. 25 subjects cultured cough aerosols that grew P aeruginosa. one subject cultured B cenocepacia from cough aerosols only with the hypertonic saline study and not from voluntary coughing. all subjects but one who cultured P aeruginosa in sputum also cultured P aeruginosa of identical genotype in the CASS cough aerosols. the total count from sputum correlated with the total corrected count for voluntary coughing from the aerosols (r = 0.58, p = 0.008) positive air samples were associated with a high concentration in cough aerosols. if only subjects with AES2 were considered, four out of five subjects with total cough aerosol counts >1000 CFU had positive air samples. temperature and humidity did not vary significantly between study sites or study days at each site. there was no significant association between cough aerosol CFU counts and any other clinical factor including gender, age, testing at paediatric or adult centre, current exacerbation status, FVC, MIP, MEP, percentage predicted FEV1. there was a trend for an association of peak expiratory flow (r = 0.36, p = 0.079) and of body mass index (r = 0.37, p = 0.058) with total corrected count for voluntary coughing. sputum microbiology In the 12 months before the study, 27 subjects had sputum cultured positive for P aeruginosa. one subject had cultured B cenocepacia (table 2). in six subjects Staphylococcus aureus was cultured and in two methicillin-resistant S aureus was cultured. other organisms cultured from sputum included -haemolytic streptococci, Aspergillus species and yeasts. microbiology of sputum and CASS samples Infection status prior to study Expectorated sputum. two subjects had no Gram-negative bacteria cultured from cough aerosols. in five subjects with cough aerosols with P aeruginosa, additional Gram-negative bacteria were co-cultured. sputum culture was negative for S maltophilia for the other two. air sampling microbiology The chamber settle plate and afferent limb equipment was not changed between the two components of the study. the mean total count for the afferent limb was 6 CFU (95% CI 3 to 14) the mean total count for the afferent limb was 56 CFU/ml wash fluid (95% CI 10 to 303). voluntary coughing were on Andersen stages 4, 5 and 6 of the Andersen samplers. the conservative model gave similar results with 69.9% (95% CI 64.6% to 75.4%) in the small aerosol fraction. there was no significant difference in total corrected counts between voluntary coughing and hypertonic saline (p = 0.12) a large proportion of culturable particles were found to be in a size range that is likely to deposit in the lower respiratory tract. the majority of respiratory pathogens have been thought to be spread by large droplets that settle within an approximate 1 m range of an individual. patients with CF produce culturable aerosols in a wide range of particle sizes including both respiratory droplets and infectious droplet nuclei. cross-infection with P aeruginosa was believed to be uncommon and limited to siblings with CF. the concentration of bacteria in the sputum and the forced expiratory flow rates were related to cough aerosol concentration, with a trend for association with higher peak flow and higher body mass index. this suggests that patients with milder lung disease may have an increased risk of producing infectious aerosols. the presence of P aeruginosa in the cough aerosols and in the small aerosol fraction from two patients warrants further study. the significance of aerosol-positive sputum-negative results for isolation in low numbers of S maltophila (n = 2) and A xyloxidans (n = 1) is uncertain, but it is possible that separating respiratory particles by size negates the obscuring of individual colony morphotypes. a recent study examined the survival of P aeruginosa in vitro. bacterial survival, at least for a limited time period of 90 s, is favoured by lower temperature and mucoid phenotype."}
