{"summary": "many viruses use the microtubule network of the host cell for transport to their site of replication. access to the microtubule network is achieved through recruitment of cytoplasmic dynein motor proteins followed by efficient retrograde transport towards the nucleus [2],[3] most DNA viruses accumulate transiently at the microtubules prior to nuclear translocation [1],[3], [6]. egress involves the transport of assembled capsids, subviral structures or individual capsid proteins to assembly and budding sites. egress involves the transport of assembled capsids, subviral structures or individual capsid proteins to assembly and budding sites at the cell surface or at intracellular membranes. the VSP is believed to involve the consecutive activity of three distinct heteromeric complexes termed endosomal sorting complexes. PPxY type late domains where also described for the Ad capsid protein penton. it can interact with ubiquitin ligases of the Nedd4 family. but its role in Ad infection is unclear. the PPxY motif in protein VI is involved in its efficient microtubule-mediated transport and mutating it in the virus alters the intracellular targeting of Ads towards the MTOC region concomitant with a post-entry block in viral infectivity. we propose that the PPxY motif may also function during entry and interact with novel cellular pathways for efficient viral entry. protein VI was detected using antibodies against acetylated tubulin. at 4\u00b0C viral particles accumulated at the cell periphery showed sporadic positive staining with the protein VI antiserum. after 15 min, particles had entered the cell with some localized at the MTOC region. the inset shows an inverted magnification of representative virus, protein VI and the primary cilia signals from the small dashed box. in the composite protein VI signals are shown in red, green, the primary cilia in grey and the nucleus in blue. the scale bar is 10 m. wt and mutant viruses remained indistinguishable from the wt virus. morphology of the mutant virus was indistinguishable from the wt virus. in contrast, the infectious versus physical particle ratio of Ad5-VI-M1 was 20-fold lower than Ad5-VI-wt. the average plaque number per 6 well (+/ standard deviation) of three individual experiments. E1 complementing 911 cells were infected with Ad5-VI-wt or Ad5-VI-M1. replication centers were stained with E2A antibodies 24 h post-infection. conditions are indicated below each bar and are the mean of at least three independent experiments done in triplicates. to determine whether the M1 mutation influences Ad cell entry, we performed a fluorescent focus forming assay and stained cells at 8, 12 and 24 h post-infection for expression of the E2A protein. compared to Ad5-VI-wt, the Ad5-VI-M1 virus produced approximately 20-fold fewer fluorescent foci when equivalent numbers of viral particles were used for infections. this suggested alpha-sarcin enters the cell by virus-mediated endosomal membrane lysis. this provides a quantifiable marker for endsome membrane lysis. we measured the incorporation of radiolabeled amino acids over time as a means to determine translational efficiency. adenovirus with altered PPxY motif lacks efficient protein VI release and shows reduced MTOC accumulation. the localization for the M1 virus was 50% for each region showing a decreased targeting towards the MTOC. over 700 particles were counted for each condition. a quantification of the MTOC localization is shown to the right. cells were infected with fluorescently labeled Ad5-VI-wt or Ad5-VI-M1. mutated particles were counted inside the 10 m radius. expressed wt (VI-wt), mutant (VI-M1) and protein VI deleted in the amphipathic helix (VI-) fused to mRFP in cells and analyzed protein VI localization in relation to microtubules. we found VI-wt in a punctuated distribution throughout the cell suggesting association with a vesicular compartment or tubulo-vesicular structures associated with microtubules. we then performed live-cell imaging using cells expressing mRFP-VI-wt or mRFP-VI-M1. we found that protein VI-M1 motility was greatly reduced compared to protein VI-wt. in the top panel a moving particle is depicted by a grey arrow within each frame using the departure point depicted by a white arrow as reference. the lower panel shows VI-M1 not moving. a moving particle is depicted by a grey arrow within each frame. sembly believed to occur during Ad entry by exposing virions to 48\u00b0C. heat and mock-treated samples were subjected to in vitro ubiquitylation reactions. western blot analysis showed partial capsid disassembly resulted in the appearance of protein VI reactive signals with discrete size increments suggesting predominant modification with two to three ubiquitin. western blot analysis using anti-protein VI antibodies shown with ubiquitylated proteins marked with grey arrows (VI-Ubi) and unmodified protein VI (VI) is marked with a black arrow. protein VI-reactive bands are indicated by the black arrow and grey arrows. protein VI ubiquitylation depends on virus disassembly, ii) an intact PPxY domain and iii) the presence of a cytosolic ubiquitylation activity. protein VI binds to Nedd4 ligases via the PPxY motif. protein VI (VI-wt) was N-terminally fused to mRFP and co-transfected with GFP-Nedd4.1 (first row), GFP-Nedd4.2 (second row), GFP-AIP4/Itch (third row), GFP-AIP4/Itch (third row), GFP-WWP1 (fourth row) and GFP-WWP2 (last row) Nedd4.1, Nedd4.2, AIP4/Itch, WWP1 and WWP2 were highly enriched on VI-wt beads. none of the other ligases showed strong binding to VI-wt- or to VI-M1-beads. this leads to relocalization of the ligases from the cytoplasm to a membrane compartment. in vitro ubiquitylation reaction was performed using recombinant active Nedd4.2 (lane 1 and 2) or inactive Nedd4.2 (lane 3). Modified protein VI (grey arrows) or unmodified protein VI (black arrows) was detected following western blot analysis. Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2 depleted cells show less viral particles accumulating at the MTOC. error bar represents cell-to-cell variation (n>15, p0.05) because Nedd4.2 showed strongest effect on Ad transduction. one shRNA also reduced viral infection at very high transduction rates. a second shRNA showed no effect on Ad transduction. a hallmark of Ad5 infection is its transient accumulation at the MTOC during entry. protein VI was detected using an affinity purified polyclonal-antiserum. at 4\u00b0C viral particles accumulated at the cell periphery showed sporadic positive staining with the protein VI antiserum. results were obtained in hTERT-RPE1 cells (Figure S1) together these data suggested that structural rearrangements leading to protein VI release during Ad entry. protein VI was detected using anti-protein VI antibodies (left column), adenoviral particles by detecting the Alexa-488 fluorescent signal (second column) and the MTOC by staining the primary cilia (third column) mutation was previously shown to abolish late domain functions with no apparent structural changes, which would impair virus assembly [35],[36]. mutant and wt virus banded at identical densities and gave similar yields of particles as determined by genome and protein quantification. biochemical analysis of capsid composition showed no apparent differences between wt and mutant viruses. individual capsid proteins shown on the left. western blot analysis of protein VI for Ad5-VI-wt (lane 1) and Ad5-VI-M1 (lane 2). Negative stain of purified Ad capsids. the 100% infection of wt infected cells at 100 physical particles per cell is saturated and not comparable to M1. conditions are indicated below each bar and are the mean of at least three independent experiments done in triplicates. the spread of the M1 mutant virus was significantly slower and led to fewer and much smaller plaques. we infected A549 cells with 30, 300 or 3000 particles per cell of either Ad5-VI-wt or Ad5-VI-M1 in the presence of alpha-sarcin. alpha-sarcin enters the cell by virus-mediated endosomal membrane lysis. we observed no difference between the PPxY-mutant virus and the wt controls. we then characterized the release of protein VI from fluorescently labeled Ad-VI-M1 and Ad5-VI-wt following synchronous infections of U2OS cells using the infection assay. denovirus with altered PPxY motif lacks efficient protein VI release and shows reduced MTOC accumulation. over 700 particles were counted for each condition. 10 m and 20 m in diameter were positioned around the MTOC. mutated particles are less likely to accumulate at the MTOC then wt particles. the error bar represents cell-to-cell variation (n>15, p0.05). protein VI fusions appear in red, microtubules in green and the nucleus in blue. the scale bar is 10 m, Please note that the lower panel is a higher magnification. nocodazole-treated cells were transfected with VI-wt (top row) or VI-M1 (bottom row) fused to mRFP. frames were taken at 1 sec intervals using a cascade 512B 2 camera. relocalization towards the cell center was observed for VI-M1. together these data suggested that protein VI is a highly mobile protein that moves along microtubules. PPxY motif is essential for protein VI ubiquitylation upon partial Ad disassembly. we adapted an in vitro Ad disassembly assay mimicking the partial capsid disassembly believed to occur during Ad entry by exposing virions to 48\u00b0C. protein VI is ubiquitylated following capsid disassembly. ubiquitylation of penton base was confirmed by using GST-ubiquitin. fiber and protein IIIA were not modified. protein VI ubiquitylation depends on i) virus disassembly, ii) an intact PPxY domain and iii) the presence of a cytosolic ubiquitylation activity. protein VI binds to Nedd4 ligases via the PPxY motif. mRFP fusion protein together with each of the ligases fused to GFP in U2OS cells. when expressed alone, most ligases localized primarily to the cytoplasm. when VI-wt is coexpressed with Nedd4.1, Nedd4.2 or AIP4/Itch, the ligases are recruited to the same membrane compartment as protein VI. over-expressed in cells and cytosolic extracts were used for pulldown experiments using recombinant protein VI-wt or VI-M1 coupled to beads. two ligases, Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2, were highly enriched on VI-wt beads while none of the other ligases showed strong binding to VI-wt- or VI-M1-beads. most ligase knockdowns had no significant effects on transduction. Nedd4.2 knockdown diminished transduction by 50%. ubiquitylates protein VI and is required for efficient Ad transduction. fluorescently labeled Ad was used to infect cells following control depletions (shLuc) or depletion of Nedd4.1 or Nedd4.2 using (sh4.1 (1) and sh4.2 (1) as in C) cells were fixed and stained for the MTOC using a pericentrin antibody. we transduced cells with lentiviral vector expressing shRNAs against either Nedd4.1 or Nedd4.2 or luciferase as a control. transduction efficiency was monitored using a GFP expressing lentiviral vector in control cells. seven days post-transduction shRNA treated cells were infected with AdGFP virus as described above. MTOC accumulation for Nedd4.1 and Nedd4.2 shRNA treated cells was reduced when compared to cells treated with control shRNA. these data provide evidence that release of protein VI during entry and a possible interaction between the PPxY motif of protein VI and Nedd4-family ligases are determinants of Ad5 trafficking during infection. the link between these steps has been best exemplified in case of the thermostable temperature-sensitive mutant Ad2ts1. protein VI exposure from Ad5 capsids occurs within minutes when pre-adsorbed Ad5 is shifted from 4\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C. this is consistent with the loss of the fiber prior to internalization and the rapid accumulation of Ad5 in the cytosol. protein VI is engaged in rapid intracellular trafficking that depends on intact microtubules. protein VI is exposed after entry and that capsid disassembly is required for its ubiquitylation. it is consistent with our hypothesis that the PPxY motif is accessible only during Ad entry following partial capsid disassembly. a role for Nedd4.1 or Nedd4.2 in Ad entry is underscored by our observation that Nedd4.2 can directly ubiquitylate protein VI via the PPxY motif. depletion also reduced MTOC accumulation of viral particles following infection. further studies will be needed to identify a specific role for each ligase in Ad entry and trafficking towards the MTOC. release and separation of protein VI from the capsid is clearly defective in the Ad5-VI-M1 mutant virus. lack of functional PPxY may block disassembly steps, preclude efficient endosomal escape following the membrane lysis event or fail in recruitment of subsequent factors required to efficiently link the virus with retrograde transport pathways. hTERT-RPE1 cells were grown in DMEM GlutamaxTM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% of fetal calf serum (Biowest) hTERT-RPE1 cells were a kind gift from M.
