{"summary": "the clinical evidence of HED has not been well concluded. six electronic databases (Medline, Embase, the Cochrane database, Chinese National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang database, and Chinese Biology and Medicine database) will be searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) which evaluate the clinical efficacy of HED for the treatment of VKC. there are numerous topical drugs used in VKC treatment, such as vasoconstrictors, mast-cell stabilizers, antihistamines, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, corticosteroids, and immunomodulators. a traditional Chinese herb has been used for the treatment of various diseases for hundreds of years. studies enrolled 10 patients will also be excluded. 2.1.3. Interventions Patients treated with the same drug of the intervention group other than HED. no restriction regarding the doses, frequency, or duration of the administered drugs. included studies will be collected: 1st author and published year, study area and duration, patient characteristics such as gender and age, baseline of symptom, dose and treatment duration of HED in the experimental group. if any required items have not been published in the original study, the reviewer (ZWY) will contact the original authors for missing data by e-mail. the study will be categorized into \u201cHigh risk\u201d or \u201cUnclear\u201d. the assessment will be done by 2 reviewers (LYY and XYC) independently. any discrepancies will be solved with a 3rd reviewer (ZWY) patients treated with the same drug of the intervention group other than HED will also be included. 2.1.2. Participants Patients diagnosed with VKC will be included regarding the diagnostic criteria used in the original study. two reviewers (LYY and XYC) will review the titles and/or abstracts of studies and select studies according to eligibility criteria independently. full text of searched studies will be reviewed if needed. any discrepancies will be solved with a 3rd reviewer (ZWY) the collected data will be managed using an electronic table. the collection will be done by 2 reviewers (LYY and XYC) independently. any discrepancies will be solved with a 3rd reviewer (ZWY) the included study will be categorized into \u201cLow risk\u201d if all items are categorized into \u201cHigh risk\u201d or the study will be categorized into \u201cUnclear\u201d. the assessment will be done by 2 reviewers (LYY and XYC) independently. any discrepancies will be solved with a 3rd reviewer (ZWY) the major limitation is that the credibility of this systemic review and meta-analysis will be affected by the quality of included studies. lyy and XYC designed the protocol; LYY and XYC reviewed the search strategy; LYY and XYC drafted the protocol; ZWY registered the protocol in PROSPERO."}
