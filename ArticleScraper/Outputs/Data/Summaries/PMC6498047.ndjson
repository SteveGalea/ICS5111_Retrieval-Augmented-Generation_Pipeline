{"summary": "guinea fowl coronavirus diversity has Phenotypic Consequences. spike-receptor interactions determine tropism and pathogenicity. reovirus infection of the brain results in astrogliosis. NK cells accumulate in infected tissues and contribute to EBOV pathogenicity. NK cells relocate to infected tissues rather than undergo cell death. phosphorylation of ANDV nucleocapsid protein regulates interferon responses. soluble envelope glycoprotein (Env) and virions from the viral inoculum sensitize uninfected cells to ADCC prior to de novo Env expression. these results provide a new mechanism for antibody-mediated protection against HIV."}
