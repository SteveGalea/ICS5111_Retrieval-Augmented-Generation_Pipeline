{"summary": "osteosarcoma only accounts for 5% to 6% of all childhood tumors. at the time of diagnosis, about 10% to 20% of patients have evidence of metastatic disease, most commonly (90%) in the lungs. most chemotherapy regimens applied for osteosarcoma have been based on the following drugs. crude extracts from the TSL exert potent antiproliferative effects on many types of cancer, including leukemia, lung, oral squamous carcinoma, prostate, and ovary. the effects of TSL on osteosarcoma cells are rarely investigated. the powder was then dissolved in 99.5% ethanol and centrifuged at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant portion was further lyophilized with a Virtis apparatus. human osteosarcoma cell lines were cultured in a humidified atmosphere. denocarcinoma epithelial cell line (H441) and normal osteoblasts were seeded in 96-well plates. cells were then incubated overnight in 10% FBS media containing different amounts of TSL fractions and gallic acid. then, cells were cultured in media containing 2 mg/mL of MTT. reaction of MTT was terminated by adding 100 L of dimethyl sulfoxide. 100 % Annexin V-FITC and Propidium Iodide double-stained Flow Cytometry To distinguish between apoptosis and necrosis, Saos-2 cells and normal osteoblasts were seeded in 6-well plates (2 105 cells/well) after drug treatment for 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours, cells were collected and stained using the Annexin V-FITC Apoptosis Detection Kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) at room temperature four-week-old male nude mice were acclimated to the laboratory environment for 1 week before the experiments were initiated. the animals were acclimated to the laboratory environment for 1 week before the experiments were initiated. nude mice were fed with DDW, 1 g/kg TSL-1, or 5 g/kg TSL-1 every 2 days for 5 weeks. weight of mice and tumor diameters were measured weekly after the first day of injection. tumors were harvested after nude mice were sacrificed. ,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine solution containing 0.01% hydrogen peroxide was then added, resulting in a brown color. sections were counterstained with hematoxylin and examined by light microscopy. a P value less than.05 was considered statistically significant. and MG-63 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and Saos-2 and MG-63 were maintained in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM; Gibco BRL, Bethesda, MD) the cultures were maintained in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C. reaction of MTT was terminated by adding 100 L of dimethyl sulfoxide. absorbance OD values were measured at 540 nm by using a microplate reader. cells were seeded in 24-well plates (5 104 cells/well) cells were counted by laser flow cytometer (EPICS Elite; Coulter, Hialeah, FL) to detect cells undergoing apoptosis or necrosis. real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) Saos-2 cells were seeded in 6-well plates (2 105 cells/well) to analyze gene expression of apoptosis. the specific PCR products were detected by measuring the fluorescence of a double-stranded DNA binding dye. the relative mRNA expression level was normalized with GAPDH. the animals were acclimated to the laboratory environment for 1 week. immunohistochemistry Tumor sections were rehydrated, and endogenous peroxidase activity in the tissue was blocked by treatment with 3% hydrogen peroxide. sections were digested with a mixture of 2.5% hyaluronidase (Sigma, St Louis, MO) and 1 mg/mL pronase in phosphate-buffered saline. 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, and 5 mg/mL of TSL fractions, including TSL-1, TSL-2, and TSL1-5-7, and gallic acid inhibit cell viability of MG-63, Saos-2, and U2OS at 24 hours. IC50 dosage of TSL-1 on human osteosarcoma cell lines is 10 times lower than that on H441 cells. SL-1 decreases about 30% (24 hours) to 40% (48 hours) of cell viability in normal human osteoblasts. TSL-1 has lower inhibitory effect on normal human osteoblasts than human osteosarcoma cells, Saos-2. TSL-1 induces cell death of human osteosarcoma cells, Saos-2. cells treated with 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/mL TSL-1 were analyzed for pro-apoptotic factor. we found positive stains in 1 and 5 g/kg TSL-1 treated groups. control showed no observable stain in tumor session at the fifth week. tumors became larger in all groups, further supporting our finding that TSL-1 is able to slow down the growth of tumor. human osteosarcoma cells were treated with 0.005, 0.05, 0.5, and 5mg/mL of TSL fractions for 24 hours. at the end of treatment, the cell viability was measured by MTT assay (A). TSL-1 has lower inhibitory effect on normal human osteoblasts than human osteosarcoma cells, Saos-2. 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/mL TSL-1 significantly increase apoptosis in Saos-2. 0.2 mg/mL of TSL-1 induces necrosis but not necrosis in Saos-2. Saos-2 cells treated with 0.1, 0.15, and 0.2 mg/mL TSL-1 were stained with Annexin-V and propidium iodide followed by flow cytometry analysis at 6, 12, 24, and 48 hours. TSL-1 increases mRNA expression of pro-apoptotic factor, Bax, Bcl-2, Bcl-xl, Bad, and Bak. -1 reduces tumor volume and increases caspase-3 in animal study. nude mice were randomly divided into 3 groups: control (DDW only; n = 5), 1 g/kg TSL-1 group (n = 5), and 5 g/kg TSL-1 group (n = 5) changes in body weight (A) and tumor volume (B) weekly. more than half of the current anticancer drugs originate from natural sources. more than half of the current anticancer drugs originate from natural sources. more than half of the current anticancer drugs originate from natural sources. the dose for apoptosis of human premyelocytic leukemia HL-60 cells was much higher than that required for Saos-2 cells. the crude extract of TSL at the dilution of 64 times induced apoptosis of A549 lung adenocarcinoma cells. the antitumor effect of TS is not a specific finding of our group. we found an IC50 dosage of TSL-1 on human osteosarcoma cell lines 10 times lower than that on H441 cells in our study. the actual active constituents of TSL in this study were not identified. TSL-1 has the potential to be a promising anti-osteosarcoma adjuvant functional plant extract."}
