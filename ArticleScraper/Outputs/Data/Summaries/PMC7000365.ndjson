{"summary": "influenza type A and B are responsible for major outbreaks compared with type C and D, which are less virulent, genetically stable and infect animals only. hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are further classified into different subtypes. HA and NA are responsible for the binding of a virus with sialic acid of respiratory tract cells and release of viral progeny from infected cells. avian influenza virus specifically recognizes, 2-6 glycosidic bond between sialic acid and galactose on respiratory cells. pigs have both types of sialic acid receptors for antigens, which are possessed by virus of avian or human susceptibility. after 40 years in 1957, another subtype (H2N2) caused pandemic. it was a mild influenza pandemic with a fatality rate of 0.67%. after that, in April 2009, a novel influenza virus emerged at pandemic level in Mexico of phase 6 declared by world health organization. RT-PCR is a method of choice for confirmation of disease but it is labour intensive and costly. this assay shows 97% accuracy and limit of detection is 0.1\u2013102 PFU/ml. current sensing methods need a continuous upgradation to solve all growing challenges for the diagnosis of a virus. diagnostic methods for A (H1N1)pdm09 (swine flu) are old as well as new. it is challenging to diagnose pathogen in case of influenza, because it shows similar symptoms like rhinoviruses, parainfluenza, adenoviruses and respiratory syncytial virus. rapid diagnostic test kits HA, NP 49.4%, 79.5% 93%, 100% [104] 5 Rapid fluorescent immunochromatographic strip test NP protein 85.29% 100% [105] Notes: NP, nucleoprotein; HA, hemagglutinin. the detection methods of influenza A(H1N1) can be classified as follow: Clinical diagnosis Virus culture Immunofluorescence test Complement fixation Double immunodiffision test Single radial-immunodiffusion test Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay Hemagglutination inhibition. new commercial mixed cell lines (R-Mix cells, R-mix Too) are also available, which have more sensitivity than other cell lines and take less time. sensitivity and specificity is 70\u2013100% and 80\u2013100% respectively. complement fixation was a traditional method for influenza virus detection using anti-sera for two stable, type specific antigens. nucleoprotein and matrix protein are the most stable antigens that have been used for the typing of virus. single radial-immunodiffusion test This method can be used to check the antigenicity of virus hemagglutinin and content of hemagglutinin in test antigens. it can detect antigenic differences in HA that cannot be detected by DI. anti-HA polyclonal antibodies against HA protein were used. ELISA sensitivity decreased after 105 (log 10/ml) viral load. sensitivity decreased after 107 (log 10/ml) viral load. hemagglutinin inhibition is an assay that was used to check the virus antigenic type, subtype classification specificity of antibodies for hemagglutinin subtypes and to confirm the infection of influenza [55,56]. it is a simple and easy method for detection that requires simple technique and material. in this assay, hemagglutination is inhibited by adding antibodies specific for hemagglutinin that prevent antigen to bind with RBC and to form complex RIDTs can be tested in three formats- dipstick, cassettes and cards. sensitivity differs according to the specimen type, skills of technicians, time after infection and age of patient etc. in a two step RT-PCR, RNA has to be converted into cDNA. in one step random hexamers are used for amplification of segments. matrix gene shows conservation in virus that makes it useful for typing of influenza. subtyping is carried out with HA gene using specific primers. a specific RT-LAMP method was developed for specific evaluation and subtyping of influenza viruses by [70] in this method, two sets of forward primer and two sets of inner primers were used in which one set recognizes outer region and the other set recognizes inner region. strand displacement is considered to be the most important step as it determines the time for completion of the process. a biosensor has four components, a biological analyte, a transducer, an amplifier and a processor. when a biological component binds with a receptor that is already pre-attached to the surface of electrode, it can be enzyme\u2013ligand, antigen\u2013antibody, DNA, RNA that generates a signal in the form of current/charge, heat and gas. many nano-sized transducers are available at commercial level that can be carbon nanotubes Optical biosensors are based on the detection of the pathogen through the change in color or production of color during reaction between analyte and target. a number of variations based on the type of visual method are reported in optical biosensors such as fluorescent biosensor, luminescent, colorimetric and interferometric biosensors. neomembranes made of bovine brain lipid having sialoglycolipids on HPA sensor chip. binding was best at 30\u201335\u00b0C temperature as compared with 10\u00b0C. sensitivity of the technique is not good at ultralow concentrations. the immobilized aptamers captured AIV H5N1 in a sample solution. this sensor can detect 0.128\u201312.8 HAU in 1.5 h of H5N1. aptamers were used to make a metal-enhanced fluorescence sensor. new matrix protein (M1) antibody based gold immunosensor was developed. they claimed it as a broad spectrum test for all serotypes of influenza A virus with a sensitivity of 80\u2013100 virions/l and in 30min. biosensor Impedance is an effective way for analysing the complementary binding of DNA. it measures resistance produced due to binding of biological element on the surface of electrode with target molecule in sample. the best limit of detection was reported to be 7.5 fmol in sandwich scheme. siO2 - inverse opal (SiO2-IO) based biosensor showed high sensitivity of 103\u2013105 plaque forming unit (PFU), HA specific antibodies were attached with the same procedure with protein G (Cys-ProG) this biosensor is specific and sensitive but virus binding takes more than 2 h that makes it less preferable. potential is applied to the working and reference electrode, current is measured between working and reference electrode surface of a sensor. a three-electrode screen printed system using Ag/AgCl as a reference electrode, Pt or gold as an auxiliary electrode and Au as a working electrode has been used for detection of a number of diseases. aptamers are a segment of DNA/RNA in its tertiary structure. they can bind specifically with ssDNA, ssRNA, proteins, toxins, carbohydrates and with live cells. different shapes and forms are found in aptamers that helps them in fitting or binding specifically with target molecule. PNA-based biosensors can be a good area for A (H1N1) pdm09 biosensor development. each biosensor that is made up of piezoelectric crystal shows a definite mechanical oscillation after introduction of voltage and a change in oscillation frequency. sensitivity increased after 1 h of viral sample introduction on electrode surface. sensitivity increased after using gold nanoparticle conjugated anti-HA. sensitivity increased after using gold nanoparticle conjugated anti-HA. a sensor was developed by using nitrocellulose membrane and magnetic sensors. this combination provides a rapid assay without stop reaction step. this assay is stable and reproducible for point-of-care applications. new commercial mixed cell lines (R-Mix cells, R-mix Too) are also available. they have more sensitivity than other cell lines and take less time. confirmation was done by typing virus with fluorescent antibodies. this test detects the presence of complement fixing antibodies in patient serum. the concentration titer of complement fixing antibodies increases only when infection happens with influenza virus but remains constant or change negligibly with other respiratory virus infections. single radial-immunodiffusion test This method can be used to check the antigenicity of virus hemagglutinin and content of hemagglutinin in test antigens [46,47] it is a simple process, in which specific antibodies are separated from serum against HA and antigen is poured in wells of agarose gel. the sensitivity of both test varied according to the different viral load. it was 100% at high viral load and then decreased with low viral load. ELISA sensitivity decreased after 105 (log 10/ml) viral load. sensitivity decreased after 107 (log 10/ml) viral load. hemagglutination is a property of hemagglutinin antigen found on the surface of virus. it is inhibited by adding antibodies specific for hemagglutinin that prevents antigen to bind with RBC and to form complex. a positive result does not show agglutination in well. HI is suggested to be better for subtype detection than CF. cell lines are hybrid of A549 with MDCK cells and Mink Lung epithelial cells. sensitivity and specificity is 70\u2013100% and 80\u2013100% respectively. complement fixation test has two steps: (1) complement fixation stage and (2) indicator stage. serum is pre-heated at 56\u00b0C for one-half hour to inactivate any anti-complementary molecules. second step involves the addition of erythrocytes (sheep cells) to check the hemolysis. agarose gel can detect antigenic differences in HA that cannot be detected by DI. it is reproducible, simple and sensitive for antigenic composition. ELISA is a very specific and sensitive method for influenza detection. 1086 sera were analysed from 43 swine herds using ELISA with HI test. it was found that ELISA sensitivity and specificity were higher than HI that were 72.65% and 63.01%, respectively, for the detection of these strains. ELISA cannot detect infection at an early stage. complex that is known as hemagglutination reaction is inhibited by adding antibodies specific for hemagglutinin that prevents antigen to bind with RBC. different dilutions of antibody were prepared and poured into well which already contain antigens. a positive result does not show agglutination in well. sensitivity and specificity found 20% and 99% respectively. RIDT can easily differentiate between influenza A and influenza B. but it cannot differentiate between subtypes of influenza that makes it less favourable. testing is carried out at Specific centres which further delay diagnosis and make condition of patient severe. in 1999, a reverse transcription based polymerase chain reaction was developed to differentiate between two different subtypes of influenza A H1 and H3. s were used in which one set recognizes outer region and the other set recognizes inner region. some researchers added two extra primers for loop regions that increase its sensitivity and specificity. strand displacement is considered to be the most important step as it determines the time for completion of the process. rapid influenza test and DFA test were 9.7%, 20.6%, 32.35% respectively. the specificity of both rapid influenza test and DFA test were 98.2%, 99%, 99% respectively. PCR based detection methods Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the method of choice that is currently in use for swine flu detection. sensitivity was 88.2%, 70% and specificity was 100%, 95.2% in case of egg fluids and lung tissue homogenates respectively [66]. a new real-time PCR and conventional RT-PCR assay was developed for detection of novel A(H1N1)pdm09. it can discriminate seasonal H1N1 viruses from other subtypes and also between other swine viruses and human H1 types successfully. biosensor was developed by Clark and Lyon in 1962 for glucose detection in blood using immobilization of glucose oxidase enzyme. the biosensor can sense any biological object like DNA, RNA, PNA, protein, enzyme, antigen and antibody based on their affinity to bind with their complementary segments. the biosensor can sense any biological object like DNA, RNA, protein, enzyme, antigen and antibody based on their affinity to bind with their complementary segments. biosensors can be classified into different types based on their method of result interpretation. there are optical biosensors, electrochemical, piezoelectric and conductometric biosensor. these biosensors can have different variations in term of visual detection methods. an antibody with specific fluorescence label (Cy3-labeled anti-H1 Ab) was used as a signal for detection through microchannels. with increasing concentration of fluorescent labeled antibody, the signal also increases, which was verified using confocal microscopy. it is a label free technique that gives information in real time about binding capability between protein\u2013protein, DNA, antigen\u2013antibody. a new improved SPR biosensor with electro-optic modulator (EOM) was used to produce optical heterodyne signals. it was a dual

109 to 108 fold specifically. alternating voltage causes mechanical oscillations of crystal and frequency of oscillations is measured as the crystal is put into oscillation circuit. a simple concentration that can change mass on surface after binding on electrode is enough for detection but a slight change in viscosity of medium, density of buffer solutions produce hindrance in actual result. synthetic sialylglycopolymer was used for discs modification with a receptor layer. results were analysed by monitoring resonance frequency shift of the disc radial mode with a detection limit of concentrations below 105 virus particles per millilitre. magnetic biosensors are made up of paramagnetic or super-paramagnetic particles. the pathogen through the change in color or production of color during reaction between analyte and target is reported in optical biosensors such as fluorescent biosensor, luminescent, colorimetric and interferometric biosensors. a fluorescent immunosensor
