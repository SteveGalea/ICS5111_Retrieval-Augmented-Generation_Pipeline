{"summary": "some strains of IBV are strongly nephropathogenic, and may cause nephrosis\u2014nephritis, urolithiasis, and mortality. protection against the disease mainly relies on vaccination, which is complicated by the high mutation rate and recombinations in the viral genome. the PCR-based detection of IBV is best achieved by targeting a conservative region of the viral genome, such as the 5\u2032UTR (Callison et al. 2006), followed by a \u2018characterizing\u2019 assay, which targets a region that allows genotyping upon nucleotide sequencing and phylogenetic analysis. a broader scale analysis of the S1 gene of this group was carried out. in the partial and the nearly complete S1 gene phylogeny the strains grouped in a different way, suggesting potential recombination in the background. the sequences were analysed for signs of recombination. PCR and sequencing RNA was extracted from the harvested allantoic fluids. the amplified 380 nucleotide long PCR product was sequenced by using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Sequencing Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) KC533681, KC533682, KC533683, KC533684, DQ487085, JX173488, and JX173489 were collected from GenBank. the nucleotide sequences obtained in this study were deposited in the GenBank under the accession numbers KU238160-KU238-179. a genetically related Iranian isolate was also involved in the study. the age of the chickens varied between 17 and 36 days. the most frequent clinical findings were respiratory symptoms. unspecific symptoms with reduced weight gain, nephritis, and nephrosis were also observed. a selection of the strains (D1456/1/10EG, D1795/2/7/11EG, D1887/2/3/12EG, D1903/22/EG, D2572/2/2/14EG) were subjected to full-length S1 gene PCR according to a published protocol (Adzhar et al. 1996; Liu and Kong 2004). a more comprehensive analysis was performed including strains throughout 2010\u20132015. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the Neighbor-joining and Maximum Likelihood methods in MEGA 5.1. the Neighbor-net analysis of the SplitsTree 4 software (Huson and Bryant 2006) was used to identify recombination breakpoints in the near complete S1 sequences. im, Afifi, and El-Kady (2012) fall into the group of Variant 2-like viruses named IS/1494/06 group by Ganapathy, Ball and Forrester (2015) together with the Egypt/Beni-Suef/01 strain. isolates from different years were selected (D1456/1/10 EG, D1795/2/7/11 EG, D1887/2/3/12 EG, D1903/21/12 EG, D2572/2/2/14 EG the sequences subjected to whole S1 gene sequences are shown in italic. asterisk indicates the grouping of Ganapathy, Ball and Forrester (2015). indicates strains of Egyptian origin; reference strains are underlined. a larger piece of recombined fragment of the S1 gene (166\u2013600 nt) comprises of D1456/1/5/10EG, D1903/21/12EG, D2572/2/2/14EG, and D2930/3/2/15EG strains. another one with a shorter fragment (335\u2013556 nt) two S1 sequences of GenBank origin, Eg/12197B/2012 (KC533683) and Eg/12120s/2012 (KC533684), showed the very same recombinant pattern as the D1456-like viruses. the location of the larger recombinant fragment overlapped with two reported antigenic domains of the S1 gene. the shorter recombinant fragment overlapped with one antigenic domain. IBVs have been detected in Egypt for >60 years, including Massachusetts, D274, 4/91, and the so-called Egyptian variant genotypes (Abdel-Moneim, Afifi, and El-Kady 2012), and further, IS585/98, Sul/01/09, IS/1494, and variants related to IS/885 (Susan, El-Hady and Soliman 2010; Mahmood, Sleman, and Uthman two types of recombinants were identified, represented by four and two strains of our collection, which affected two or one antigenic domain of the S1 gene. this phenomenon, when a 793/B serotype strain shifted to H120 serotype due to recombination of the 5\u2032 terminal of the S1 gene was recently reported. this aspect can best be investigated in relevant animal trials. conflict of interest None declared. conflict of interest."}
