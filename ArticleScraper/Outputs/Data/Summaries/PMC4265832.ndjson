{"summary": "the largest, most sustained, and widespread Ebola outbreak in history was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (WHO) in august 2014, the largest, most sustained, and widespread Ebola outbreak in history was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) the WHO was initially notified of the outbreak in March 2014,[8] after a febrile illness cluster associated with a high case fatality rate in the area of Gueckedou, Guinea. sporadic cases were being diagnosed beyond Guinea, including liberia, Sierra Leone, Senegal, Mali, Nigeria, and most recently in the united states and Spain. in west africa, the number of new EBOV cases was increasing at an accelerating rate, with a number of factors contributing to this phenomenon. the global response to the current epidemic was initially slow, disorganized, financially constrained, and poorly planned and executed. the international medical community must realize that the confluence of circumstances and factors beyond human control may not always be in the society's favor. a recently \u2018imported\u2019 case of Ebola in New York City should serve as a wakeup call and a global stimulus for both local and global coordinated action. initial documented episodes of filovirus hemorrhagic fever were seen in the late 1960s, in nonhuman primates, which were being transported to Germany for vaccine development. in 1976, reappearance of hemorrhagic fever outbreaks were noted to affect people in south Sudan and Zaire. phase I can be characterized as the transfer of EBOV from an animal carrying the virus to a human, usually via small cutaneous lesions. Phase III represents the advanced Ebolavirus disease, with hemorrhagic manifestations, impaired immunity, and end-organ failure. a systemic inflammatory response is initiated, resulting in cytokine and chemokine release from the infected macrophages and other cells. the appearance of hemorrhagic symptoms is associated with a worse prognosis. high fever with relative bradycardia mimicking the presentation of typhoid fever has also been reported. progressive, diffuse, erythematous, nonpruritic, maculopapular rash around the face, neck, trunk, and arms usually appears by the end of the first week. gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain begin to develop. hematological symptoms, including injection site bleeding, vaginal bleeding, hematuria, epistaxis, and bleeding from the gums were more frequently seen in patients who died. values shown on the y-axis represent percentages. the confirmatory diagnosis for Ebola involves detection of the viral antigens or RNA in the blood or other body fluids. newer rapid diagnostic methods are rapidly evolving,[82,83] and are expected to be available for deployment in the near future. some have suggested anti-retroviral agents may have some effectiveness against EBOV,[96] but these claims remain both unproven and controversial. an experimental drug called ZMapp (Mapp Biopharmaceutical, San Diego, California, USA) is also based on the concept of passive immunotherapy. both vaccines demonstrated promising rates of efficacy in nonhuman primates. the translation of these results to human subjects has not yet been accomplished. it is critical that the medical community learns from previous mistakes. any biological specimens or samples obtained from EBOV patients should be collected using adequate personal protective equipment. for blood work of patients suspected with EBOV, under no circumstances should manual pipetting and open centrifugation be considered. disinfectants with a higher potency to kill the virus should be used. the idea of a robotic device could help in the care of Ebola patients by delivering supplies, disinfecting, and transporting hazardous specimens, among other functionalities. the possibility of creating volunteer teams of Ebola survivors could help in the direct care of the exposed and acutely ill cases. active surveillance is a public health approach that consists of the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of key clinical data. active surveillance is critical for containing the outbreaks of Ebola, especially in urban settings where human-to-human transmission predominates. there have been calls from professionals and politicians to 'honor' workers returning from the Ebola front in west africa. the decision was made by scientific experts that quarantine should be put into place because no one knew how the disease was effectively spread and how quickly it spread across the globe. there is a basis to state that the fear of Ebola in 2014 seems to be greater than that of SARS in 2003. there is evidence from quarantines carried out for the SARS epidemic that quarantine is the most effective, \u2018when it is voluntary, home-based, and accompanied by extensive outreach, communication, and education efforts\u2019. this outbreak is not the first to pit individual civil liberties against the utilitarianism of the general public's health. it is imperative to diligently contain the infection in all affected localities. a combination of core interventions has been effective in containing the disease. this is further exacerbated by the delayed and underfunded early international response. population-based prevention and treatment strategies are desperately needed. it is incumbent on the international medical community to establish a rapid and effective global response capability to large-scale epidemics. failure to act in a timely and coordinated fashion has brought us to a position where we simply must act together or face the full wrath of an out-of-control Ebola outbreak. some countries in central America are already reacting to the possibility of Ebola importation. the human development index ranked Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone one hundred and seventy-fifth, one hundred and seventy-ninth, and one hundred and eighty-third, from 187 countries, in 2014. if 800 deaths between 2002 and 2004 cost an estimated $40 billion, what will happen, not only to the west africa, but also to the world's economy, if the total cases exceed the predicted 1,400,000 mark in 2015. there is lack of agreement on what constitutes the best personal protective equipment when treating patients suffering from the virus. the key preventive interventions must include meticulous infection control in healthcare settings, creating awareness and community support for implementation of containment measures, rigorous enforcement of the existing public health protocols. voluntary quarantine and active surveillance can prove helpful."}
