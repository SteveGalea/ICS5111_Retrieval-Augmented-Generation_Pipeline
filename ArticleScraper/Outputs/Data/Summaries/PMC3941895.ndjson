{"summary": "A. kellalensis extracts were extracted with hot water and ethanol 50% (v/v) the cell viability and toxicity of the extracts were evaluated on MA-104 cells using four different methods. the extracts exert potent anti-rotaviral activity only after viral adsorption. rotaviruses are the major etiologic agents that cause severe, acute dehydrating gastroenteritis in young children. the virus is transmitted by the fecal-oral route. rotavirus causes an estimated 2 million hospitalizations and 450,000 deaths in children worldwide. the genus Achillea belongs to asteraceae or Compositae, the largest family of flowering and vascular plants (14). the genus has been used by local people as folk or traditional herbal medicines in various regions throughout the world. aqueous extract (hot water extract) was added to 10 g of powdered flowers in an Erlenmeyer flask. the brewed extract was filtered through gauze and clarified by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. the supernatant was then dried in an electric water bath at 50 C. 1 g of each of the dried extracts were suspended in 5 mL of respective solvents. cells were seeded at a density of 1 104 cells per well (in 200 L medium) of 96-well plates (Nunc) by an 8-channel pipette and 5 104 cells per well (in 1 mL medium) after 48 h of incubation at 37 C in 5% CO2 atmosphere, the medium was replaced by similar volumes of fresh medium free of FBS. the highest concentration of the extract showing no cell toxicity was considered as the maximum non-toxic concentration (M cytotoxicity test was performed using a miner modification method. plates were prepared similarl to that described for the MTT reduction assay (20). titration of the Virus Virus on confluent monolayers of MA-104 cells was performed by the limit-dilution method. the titer of propagated viral stock was determined by using the MTT colorimetric technique, crystal violet assay and CPE observation of MA-104 cells. TCID50 of activated rotaviruses were mixed with various non-toxic concentrations (0.05\u20130.5 mg/mL) of each extract. the mixtures were added to each well (0.2 mL/well) and incubated at 37 C for 1 h. the cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. the cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. experiments were carried out in 4 replicates. the 50% effective concentration (EC50) was estimated by regression analysis. aqueous extract (hot water extract) was added to 10 g of powdered flowers in an Erlenmeyer flask. brewed extract was filtered through gauze and clarified by centrifugation at 3000 rpm for 10 minutes. 1 g of each of the dried extracts were suspended in 5 mL of respective solvents. cells were seeded at a density of 1 104 cells per well (in 200 L medium) of 96-well plates (Nunc) by an 8-channel pipette and 5 104 cells per well (in 1 mL medium) all treated cells were re-incubated at 37 C for 72 h for different cytotoxic assays. the highest concentration of the extract showing no cell toxicity was considered as the maximum non-toxic concentration (MNTC) the NR assay is a cheap and sensitive method for the cytotoxicity test. the procedure was performed using a miner modification method. plates were prepared similarl to that described for the MTT reduction assay (20). the untreated cells that received only the medium without any extraction were used for maximum viability (negative control). the reported values are the mean of 4 replicates (22). 3.3.1. MTT Assay The NR assay is a cheap and sensitive method for the cytotoxicity test. titration of the Virus Virus titration on confluent monolayers of MA-104 cells was performed by the limit-dilution method. the solution was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 10 min and the supernatant was removed. the cells were stained with 0.4% trypan blue dye, transferred to the hematocytometer and counted using an optical microscope. the 50% effective concentration (EC50) was defined as the reciprocal of concentration of each extract required to prevent rotavirus-induced cytolysis by 50%. virucidal assay was performed to determine the ability of the extracts to inhibit or decrease the rate of adsorption or penetration of the rotavirus on the treated MA-104 cells. the cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. experiments were carried out in 4 replicates. the 50% effective concentration (EC50) was estimated by regression analysis. controls consisting of virus control wells or untreated-infected cells (with virus but without any extracts), toxicity control wells or treated non-infected cells (that received only the medium containing 1 g/mL of trypsin without any extraction and virus) were used simultaneously. PE inhibition assay was performed to determine if the extracts prevented viral replication by affecting one or more steps of their replication. after the incubation period, the spent medium was decanted and the cells were then washed two times using PBS. medium containing 10 TCID50 of activated rotaviruses with different non-toxic concentrations were added to each well (0.2 mL/well) of each extract (0.2 mL/well) were added to the cells and incubated for 15 h prior to virus infection (10 TCID50/well) the cells were incubated for 72 h at 37 C under 5% CO2 atmosphere. the 50% effective concentration was estimated by regression analysis. mL EC50, g/mL SI Neutral Red 700 100 7 600 100 6 Crystal Violet 1000 100 10 900 100 9 MTT 800 100 8 700 100 7 a CC50: Concentration of Extract that is Cytotoxic to 50% of cells.

A. kellalensis on Cell Viability as measured by trypan blue Dye Exclusion Method compared with positive control (0 g/mL) with 98% cell viability for aqueous extract and 97% cell viability for hydro-alcoholic extract. simultaneous treatment assay and post treatment assay were used. the extracts were not able to inhibit viral replication when the amount of virus increased from 10 to 100 TCID50 when they were examined at a concentration of 500 g/mL. these results indicate that A. kellalensis extracts exert potent anti-rotaviral activity only after viral adsorption. in vivo with bovine rotavirus strains in calves or murine rotavirus strains in mice. use of herb can be useful in veterinary medicine."}
