{"summary": "this article continues the Disorder Digest series. the aim of this series is to provide an unbiased and condensed survey of the literature on intrinsically disordered proteins on a quarterly basis. major databases for IDPs are Disprot5 and the recently updated IDEAL6. pE-DB provides an entirely new kind of database of IDPs. new methods to provide atomic resolution descriptions of IDPs indicate that we may soon see an explosion of ensemble-based analysis. sheikh et al. investigated the role of glycosylation on Skp1. found that this modification alters the secondary structure content of the protein, thereby influencing Skp1-F-box protein interactions. authors use bioinformatics to infer that the members of the SLC26 family have the same mechanism. -synuclein is thought to be intrinsically disordered. -synuclein dissociates to monomeric form when its physiological binding partner PLC2 or membranes are introduced. this result was also reconstituted in cells using microinjection. authors used biochemical assays and X-ray crystallography to elucidate the first structure of family of bacterial effector kinases, NIeH. found that the N-terminal segment is intrinsically disordered, and is autophosphorylated by the C-terminal kinase domain. authors found several significant differences between the NIeH family and classical kinases. a study by Nourse and Mittag addressed the T-cell receptor zeta subunit. instead, this protein is monomeric in solution unless driven to extremely high concentrations. previous observations interpreted to be 'fuzziness' were likely to be caused by abnormal interactions with chromatography resins. this raises the question if \u2018fuzziness\u2019 exists in nature. MAP4 is an IDP that binds to a microtubule in a multivalent manner, using its multiple binding sites. the cellular environment is crowded by a number of macromolecules, which can influence local protein concentrations and conformations. the mammalian SLC9A family of Na+/H+ exchangers control pH within organelles, cytoplasm, and the extracellular environment. the authors used bioinformatical and structural analyses to evaluate models of SLC9A ion transport. p27Kip1 is an intrinsically disordered protein that modulates G1 progression through its interactions with cyclin-dependent kinases. they propose 2 different functional paths for p27Kip1 each marked by phosphorylation on a different residue. prostate-associated gene 4 (PAGE4) is an intrinsically disordered stress-response protein that is aberrantly expressed in cancer. in the first study, Rajagopalan et al.37 demonstrate that c-Jun and PAGE4 interact and single-molecule FRET reveals that PAGE4 undergoes conformational changes upon binding. glycoprotein lactoferrin possesses a mix of ordered and intrinsically disordered domains that facilitate a wide variety of antiviral and antimicrobial activities. the journal Molecular Endocrinology presented a review on nuclear receptors (NR)42 that spotlights intrinsically disordered regions of transcription factors. ano et al.45 characterized the interaction between elongation factor-like 1 (EFL1) and Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome (SBDS) protein. they used size exclusion chromatography, gel shift assay, and isothermal titration calorimetry. the interaction is governed by the intrinsically disordered insertion domain of EFL1. proteasome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyzes the removal of introns from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons to produce mature mRNA. the splicesome is a large ribonucleoprotein complex that catalyzes the removal of introns from pre-mRNA and the ligation of exons. a family of proteins that contain a conserved cold shock domain are discussed. the binding interface of IDPs is not well characterized biophysically. the binding interface of IDPs is not well characterized biophysically. a database of structural ensembles of IDPs consists of primary experimental data. each entry consists of primary experimental data and the structural ensembles consistent with this data. IDEAL has seen an expansion of its entries of IDPs from 120 to 340. Molecular dynamics simulations Higo and Umeza63 present a multicanonical molecular dynamics simulation of 2 IDP complexes: NRSF-mSin3 and pKID-KIX. their study suggests both induced folding and conformational selection play a role in coupled binding and folding. the Hamiltonian can account for a number of effects on a system with any biopolymer. Xia and Wei introduced molecular nonlinear dynamics (MND) as a novel method for representing protein folding and aggregation. the authors demonstrated the use of homonuclear broadband proton decoupling of multidimensional NMR. they used a weak field pulsed gradient combined with frequency-selective pulses. they validated their method using 2 IDPs, -synuclein and SERF1a. oe et al. reviewed their evidence that -synuclein exists as a helically folded tetramer, which dissociate upon non-crowding conditions. authors also review the various methods and reagents used to reach their hypothesis. cellular nucleic acid binding protein (CNBP) is involved in enhancing c-myc expression and binding to ssDNA and RNA. however, purification of tag-free protein has historically been challenging. -synuclein interacts with cellular membranes and is N-terminally acetylated. a majority of lipid interactions studies use non-acetylated protein. acetylation generally increases affinity of -synuclein for membranes. authors found that blockage of the channel by -synuclein was dependent on the side of the channel that the -synuclein was added on. authors describe potential physiological effects of -synuclein aggregation on the cellular environment. the interaction interface is broad and contains a number of low affinity contacts, including dispersed hydrophobic residues characteristic of late folding intermediates. this study provides a mechanism of action as to how Hsp90 can select for IDPs as well as late folding intermediates. a review by Chang et al. describes the structural and allosteric characteristics of the N protein as it relates to intrinsic disorder. the authors propose that intrinsic disorder is essential to RNP packaging and viral self-assembly. charpentier et al.98 examine the highly flexible microtentacles that protrude from the cell membrane. they show that cancer stem-like cells have a large number of McTNs. curcumin may bind directly to tubulin or interfere with microtubule dynamics. fan and Kurgan outline a method for determining the best consensus from various combinations of 20 predictors. they then implemented a binomial deviance loss-based regression to determine the consensus of a combination of 7 high performing predictors. disMeta is focused on optimizing samples in preparation for NMR and X-ray crystallography. gerben et al.66 did a comparative study of atomistic force fields to determine which would work best with the IDP Abeta. they found that OPLS-AA, GROMOS96 53A6 and GROMOS96 54A7 produce results that fit best with experimental data. predictors of intrinsic disorder The Kurgan Lab introduced 2 very different predictors this quarter. the first, Super-fast predictor of proteins with long disordered regions greater than 30 residues in length. the second predictor is disorder based on Consensus of Predictors, or disCop,60. adenylate kinase, calmodulin and p38alpha kinase were studied by Wang et al.64. they used a combination of normal-mode analysis and umbrella sampling to study transitions in adenylate kinase, calmodulin and p38alpha kinase upon binding to their ligands. they found that hydrogen bonds in completely disordered proteins had a shorter lifetime. Xia and Wei introduced molecular nonlinear dynamics (MND) as a novel method for representing protein folding and aggregation. the authors also introduce the term intrinsically low dimensional manifolds (ILDMs) as a characteristic of folded proteins. the authors used carbon-detected spectra of the Pdx1 C-terminal domain to generate several pulse protocols that do not depend on 4D or greater experiments. the authors also reviewed the various methods and reagents used to reach their hypothesis. single-molecule spectroscopy Brucale et al. reviewed the study of IDPs using single-molecule spectroscopy. this comprehensive literature analysis encompasses approximately a decade of research and approximately 200 articles. authors speculate on the future directions of the field. authors found that this protein is highly flexible with multiple structural zincs, and it gains structure upon binding to nucleic acid. biologically relevant protein can be obtained from inclusion bodies when recombinantly produced in E.coli. authors describe the tags necessary, the purification conditions, and cleavage methods to remove the fusion tag. CP-HISQC takes advantage of both proton-decoupled HSQC and cross-polarization 1H-to-15N transfer to compensate for the loss of spectral quality caused by fast solvent exchange. the length of data collection must agree with the time of the phenomena to be observed, which is generally problematic. spectra of the Pdx1 C-terminal domain generate several pulse protocols that do not depend on 4D or greater experiments or the previously mentioned non-uniform sampling. proteins at membrane/water interfaces encounter a spectrum of solvent conditions including changes in dielectric constants and viscosity. a review of single molecule fluorescence as it pertains to IDPs is provided by Banerjee and Deniz. this review takes a more focused approach, discussing single molecule studies. a minireview by Lee examined nanopore studies of numerous peptides and proteins which interact with divalent cations. the effects of this on several IDPs such as prion, myelin basic protein, and a 30aa Zn-finger peptide are described. -synuclein has been thoroughly examined in both monomeric and oligomeric forms. this flexible linker is between 2 of the 7 helical repeats in the protein. the first 11 residues of both monomeric and oligomeric forms are important for folding into, binding, and permeabilization. a study by nguyen et al. examined an A2V variant using molecular dynamics simulations. this mutation decreased overall level of intrinsic disorder and increased -hairpin content, potentially providing an overall mechanism for the pathogenicity of this variant. oxidative stress causes formation of a disulfide bridge, resulting in the first observed interaction between the disordered N-terminus and the globular C-terminus. a long disordered v1 loop in this SPRY domain was examined by Kovalskyy and Ivanon through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. -synuclein interacts with cellular membranes and is N-terminally acetylated. a majority of lipid interactions studies use non-acetylated protein. acetylation generally increases affinity of -synuclein for membranes. authors found that blockage of the channel by -synuclein was dependent on the side of the channel that the -synuclein was added on, as well as the sidedness of the applied potential. authors describe potential physiological effects of -synuclein aggregation on the cellular environment. this study provides a mechanism of action as to how Hsp90 can select for IDPs as well as late folding intermediates. aggregation is associated with several neuropathologies. the mechanism of action is comparable to yeast prion. a review by Chang et al. describes the structural and allosteric characteristics of the N protein as it relates to intrinsic disorder. the authors propose that intrinsic disorder is essential to RNP packaging and viral self-assembly. charpentier et al.98 examine the highly flexible microtentacles that protrude from the cell membrane. they show that cancer stem-like cells have a large number of McTNs. curcumin reduced McTN in breast CSC."}
