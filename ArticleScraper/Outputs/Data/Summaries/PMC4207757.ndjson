{"summary": "influenza viruses were detected from 2009 to 2011 during the rainy season from June to November. each year, influenza viruses were detected from June to November during the rainy season. neuraminidase inhibitors would be the drug of choice for influenza treatment and chemoprophylaxis in Cambodia, as adamantanes are no longer expected to be effective. the virus is characterized by epidemics that occur seasonally throughout the world every year. the Cambodian NIC was established in 2006 as a joint collaboration between the Virology Unit at the Institut Pasteur in Cambodia (IPC), the Communicable Disease Control Department of the Ministry of Health (CDC/MoH) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in Cambodia. the country is a tropical country of almost 15 million people, with a land area of 181,035 square kilometers. an event-based surveillance system was developed by CDC/MoH and WHO during the pandemic of influenza A/H1N1 2009 virus. an ILI case was defined by the sudden onset of fever (38\u00b0C axillary temperature) and cough or sore throat in the absence of other diagnosis. naso-pharyngeal and throat specimens were placed in a vial containing 2 ml of virus transport medium (VTM) the sentinel sites obtained weekly epidemiological data from patients who fulfilled the case definition and collected naso-pharyngeal specimens from 5 to 10 cases per week. RNA was amplified using real-time RT-PCR to detect influenza A and B viruses using standard protocols. influenza A virus subtypes H1, H1pdm, H3 and H5 were detected using subtype-specific real-time RT-PCR. NIID recommended by WHO as protocol for laboratory procedures to detect avian influenza A H5N1 virus in specimens from suspected human cases. all of the influenza strains described in this study were isolated at the IPC laboratory by inoculation of the specimens that tested positive by molecular methods. the isolates were characterized by a hemagglutination inhibition assay using reference antigens and anti-sera kindly provided by the WHO. viral RNA was extracted from 200 l of MDCK supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. RNA was used as template for RT-PCR with subtype and segment-specific primers. RNA was used as template for RT-PCR with subtype and segment-specific primers. nucleotide sequence accession numbers All Cambodian influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1pdm09 and Influenza B virus sequences included in the analysis were submitted to Genbank and/or to EpiFlu Database. all of these sequences are available via GISAID website (www.gisaid.org). amino acids at positions 26, 27, 30 and 31 of the transmembrane region of the M2 protein are the residues most frequently associated with amantadine- and rimantadine-resistant strains. a p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. geographical background Cambodia is a tropical country of almost 15 million people. three additional sentinel sites were opened in 2009 and operated by the National Institute of Public Health (NIPH) in collaboration with the US CDC local office in the referral hospitals of mondulkiri (Eastern Cambodia), Svayreang (South-East Cambodia) and Kampot (South-West Cambodia) provinces. an event-based surveillance system was developed by CDC/MoH and WHO. naso-pharyngeal and throat specimens were placed in a vial containing 2 ml of virus transport medium (VTM) naso-pharyngeal and throat specimens were placed in a vial containing 2 ml of virus transport medium (VTM) samples were collected from 5 to 10 cases per week. naso-pharyngeal swab samples were stored at 4\u00b0C and shipped to the NIPH and/or AFRIMS laboratory for testing within 48 to 72 hours. RNA was amplified using real-time RT-PCR to detect influenza A and B viruses using standard protocols. influenza A virus subtypes H1, H1pdm, H3 and H5 were detected using subtype-specific real-time RT-PCR assays. the virus was detected by a one-step real-time RT-PCR developed by the laboratory at the National Institute of Infectious Diseases (NIID), Tokyo, Japan. all of the influenza strains described in this study were isolated at the IPC laboratory by inoculation of the specimens that tested positive by molecular methods onto Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. viral RNA was extracted from 200 l of MDCK supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit. RNA was used as template for RT-PCR with subtype and segment-specific primers. the products were sequenced using an ABI 3730XL automatic DNA Analyser. neuraminidase inhibitors susceptibility assays Representative isolates were randomly selected for neuraminidase drug testing. the NA-Star kit (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) used a 1,2-dioxetane derivative of sialic acid. the full M gene segments from representative influenza strains of the influenza A/H3N2, A/H1N1 and A/H1N1pdm09 subtypes virus strains were sequenced to detect mutations associated with resistance to adamantanes. the residues most frequently associated with amantadine- and rimantadine-resistant strains. patients with influenza virus infection were significantly younger than those who tested negative in the ALRI study (16.9 versus 35 years, p0.001) from 2009 to 2010, 347 (34.5%) were positive for A/H1N1 2009 virus by real-time RT-PCR. influenza activity was observed from June to December. influenza B virus co-circulated with A/H3N2 and A/H1N1pdm09 viruses during the 2009\u20132011 period, with the peak detection in the rainy season of 2011. antigenic analyses indicated that A/H3N2 strains belonged to the A/Brisbane/10/2007-like group in 2009 before drifting to the A/Perth/16/2009-like group in 2010 and 2011. neuraminidase inhibitors resistance in influenza viruses, 2009\u20132011. resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors Oseltamivir Zanamivir Virus type and subtype Isolates tested Resistant N#. Phylogenetic analysis was carried out for the sequences of the HA1 domain of 28 representative A/H3N2 strains isolated from 2009 to 2011 in Cambodia. additional sequences retrieved from GenBank and/or from EpiFlu Database (via GISAID) and corresponding to vaccine seed strains, to viruses isolated in Australia and New Zealand (southern hemisphere) the 2011 clade 5 viruses belonged to clade 3C represented by A/Victoria/361/2011 defined by the mutations S45N, T48I, A198S, V223I and N312S. phylogenetic analysis of the HA1 domains of the HA genes. almost all of the Cambodian isolates fell into the S203T clade. the majority of strains collected in 2010 and all strains collected in 2011 shared an amino acid change at position E374K. one subgroup of strains detected in 2010 shared an amino acid change at position N125D. two of the Cambodian isolates, A/Cambodia/T282/2009 and A/Cambodia/T057/2009 possessed R205K substitutions at the Ca1 antigenic site of the haemagglutinin. some of the Cambodian strains isolated in 2010 and one strain in 2011 contained the substitutions N125D involving the Sa haemagglutinin. isolated in 2011 and one strain in 2011 shared an amino acid change at L58P in the HA. no influenza B viruses isolated between 2009 and 2011 belonged to the B/Yamagata-lineage represented by vaccine strain B/Wisconsin/01/2010. in this genetic group 1 of Cambodian influenza B viruses, the subgroup of strains isolated in 2011 had two different subgroups with the mutations N129D and A154E respectively. the other subgroup, containing some of the isolates collected in 2010 and 1 strain of 2011, shared an amino acid change at L58P in the HA. 1246 (16.9%) tested positive for influenza virus: 17.6% in 2009, 14.5% in 2010 and 18.7% in 2011. the average age of influenza-infected patients was 7.3 years (range, 1 month to 65 years) and 53.9% were male. influenza A subtype was first detected on June 23rd 2009 and progressively became, along with H3N2, the most frequent influenza A subtype circulating in Cambodia. a/H1N1pdm09 activity, detected via event-based surveillance, demonstrated a peak during the period from September to November 2009, dropping to a very low level between January and May 2010 before increasing again to a small peak in June-july 2010. n strains Vaccine strains Cambodian strains 2009 A/California/7/2009-like A/Brisbane/10/2007-like A/Brisbane/10/2007-like B/Florida/4/2006-like B/Brisbane/60/2008-like 2009\u20132010 A/California/7/2009-like A/Perth/16/2009-like A/Perth/16/2009-like B/Bris all influenza A viruses that were sequenced indicated resistance to adamantanes, except for one A/H1N1pdm09 strain isolated in 2011. resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors in influenza viruses, 2009\u20132011. the viruses from the cluster 1 belonged to the A/Perth/16/2009 clade 1 viruses and contained five characteristic amino acid changes. the viruses from clusters 2 and 3 had multiple amino acid changes in common compared to that of the A/Brisbane/10/2007 virus. Isolates from each group were interspersed with strains isolated from other tropical countries throughout the phylogenetic groups in which the strains from australia (southern hemisphere) were clearly positioned basal to each viral clade. phylogenetic tree analysis was carried out for 33 HA sequences from A/H1N1pdm09 strains circulating from 2009 to 2011. phylogenetic analysis was conducted as a distance-based neighbour-joining phylogenetic tree of influenza using the HKY model. rooted to A/California/07/2009 all of the Cambodian isolates possessed residues D187 and D222 in the receptor-binding site. most common variations compared to the vaccine strain were P83S, S203T, R223Q and I321V. HA1 sequence data generated from 20 representative Cambodian influenza B viruses obtained from 2009 to 2011 are shown in Figure 5. all of the 2009 isolates, most of the 2010 isolates and more than two thirds of the 2011 isolates belonged to genetic group 1 (including influenza B vaccine strain B/Brisbane/60/2008) the vaccine reference strains are boxed. scale bar indicates number of nucleotide substitution per site. strains containing 347 amino acids of HA were compared with those of reference vaccine strains. no Cambodian B viruses isolated from 2009\u20132011 belonged to the Yamagata lineage. seasonality of influenza in Cambodia has a consistent pattern characteristic of influenza circulation in the southern hemisphere. this pattern is intermediate between southern hemisphere and tropical transmission. only 2.6% of the patients recruited in ALRI surveillance were identified as positive for influenza virus infection. 16.9% were observed among patients within the NIC's ILI surveillance. this low frequency of severe influenza cases could be related to yearly variations in influenza severity. the number of A/H1N1pdm09 virus isolates detected by event-based and sentinel surveillance systems during the highest point of the outbreak in October 2009 was 51. however, at the start of the influenza season in June 2010, the A/H1N1pdm09 isolates were first detected by both the event-based and sentinel surveillance systems before being mostly detected by the sentinel surveillance system for the rest of the season. this finding is consistent with the WHO's declaration on 10 August there was a surge of influenza B cases near the end of each influenza season, usually from November to December. low level of B viruses in the year 2009 was observed during the pandemic of A/H1N1pdm09 virus. from 2007 to 2011, except in 2009, the influenza B strains identified in Cambodia were well matched by the recommended influenza B vaccine virus. the high levels of amantadine resistance in influenza A virus strains in the community were not related to domestic amantadine use. there was also evidence that the spread of resistant A/H3N2 virus was related to linked fitness mutations and not related to drug pressure. two influenza A/H1N1 strains tested retained sensitivity to oseltamivir and zanamivir. one of these strains detected in October 2007 showed high resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors by antiviral drug susceptibility assay. the other strain could not be grown in Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. viral reintroduction plays a key role in the genesis of new clades. the earliest A/H1N1pdm09 isolates from Cambodia were detected in the period from the end of June to mid-july 2009 through event-based surveillance focused on american students visiting Phnom Penh. the substitution Q293H had been observed recently in a substantial proportion of virus strains isolated from patients who died from laboratory-confirmed cases of A/H1N1pdm09 infection. the known antigenic sites in the HA of the 1918 pandemic virus have been conserved in the pandemic. antigenic sites contain many amino acids involved in neutralising epitopes near receptor-binding pockets. variations observed in the hemagglutinin region of Cambodian A/H1N1pdm09 virus isolates most likely did not affect the antigenicity of the viruses. all of the 2009 and 2010 viruses carried the amino acid substitution K56R. some strains from 2010\u20132011 viruses carried the substitution T37I and L58P. none of these substitutions had a marked effect on the antigenicity of the viruses. this is not unusual, as influenza B virus activity is highly variable world-wide, with no established pattern. however, this could lead to the emergence of influenza B reassortants in the next influenza season [57] influenza activity in Cambodia over a six year period from 2006 to 2011 provides strong evidence that influenza was prevalent in Cambodia. since September 2009, there has been sustained circulation of predominantly A/H1N1pdm09 viruses. seasonal influenza A/H3N2 and B virus have also circulated, although to a lesser extent.
