{"summary": "chebulagic acid (CHLA) and punicalagin (PUG) blocked herpes simplex virus type 1 entry and spread. these compounds inhibited viral glycoprotein interactions with cell surface glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) cytomegalovirus (HCMV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) are available for prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral treatments. there are currently few licensed and efficacious drugs available for prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral treatments. however, there are currently few licensed and efficacious drugs available for prophylactic and therapeutic antiviral treatments. IFN treatment is prohibitively expensive and burdened with adverse side-effects. but the therapy often results in low patient compliance. there is a need to develop novel and cost-effective antiviral therapeutics. the importance of GAGs in facilitating viral infections has been demonstrated by using soluble heparin or GAG-deficient cell lines to block the entry of several viruses. in our previous study, we identified chebulagic acid (CHLA) and punicalagin (PUG) as inhibitors of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) entry and spread. cell surface glycosaminoglycans for entry HCMV Herpesviridae dsDNA + + HCV Flaviviridae ssRNA + + DENV-2 Flaviviridae ssRNA + + MV Paramyxoviridae ssRNA + + + RSV Paramyxoviridae ssRNA + +/- Methods Cells, Viruses, and Reagents Dulbecco\u2019s h-7.5 and HEp-2 cells were cultured in the same medium condition as just described.

HS-mediated entry is only important for ADV-5 in the absence of its primary receptor CAR (coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor) free virus particles are inactivated by CHLA and PUG. they were previously observed to inactivate HSV-1 particles and prevent their interaction with the host cell surface. both tannin compounds effectively prevented attachment of the investigated viruses. inhibition of virus attachment by CHLA and PUG was similar against HCMV, HCV, DENV-2, and RSV. inhibition of entry varied from 50 \u2013 80%. both CHLA and PUG effectively inhibited HCMV, HCV, and MV infections (80 \u2013 100% protection), but were ineffective against the growth of DENV-2 and RSV ( 25%). the results are in agreement with the data obtained following post-entry drug treatment in Figure 6. antiviral effects of CHLA and PUG were evaluated against a panel of enveloped viruses whose entry involves cellular surface GAGs. the highest inhibitory concentration of the compounds was used. both compounds showed significant inhibitory effect on enveloped viruses known to engage GAGs for infection, including HCMV, HCV, DENV-2, MV, and RSV. both compounds showed only limited efficacy (SI 10) against infections by VSV and ADV-5. oviruses MV and RSV were observed, whereas near 100% inhibition was achieved against HCMV, HCV, and DENV-2. both tannin compounds effectively prevented attachment of the investigated viruses. inhibition of virus attachment by CHLA and PUG was similar against HCMV, HCV, DENV-2, and RSV, and ranged from 90 \u2013 100%. CHLA and PUG effectively inhibited HCMV, HCV, and MV infections (80 \u2013 100% protection), but were ineffective against the growth of DENV-2 and RSV ( 25%). both tannins were able to abrogate host cell binding and penetration by HCMV, HCV, and MV. the two tannins are effective in limiting post-infection spread of HCMV, HCV, and MV, but are inefficient in preventing cell-to-cell transmission of DENV-2 and RSV. the window of antiviral activity from CHLA, PUG, and heparin at different stages of viral entry and spread are summarized in Table 3. inhibition of virus-host cell entry is an effective antiviral control strategy. based on the way a virus infects a host cell through interactions between viral glycoproteins and cellular membrane molecules, countermeasures against this process have been developed. heparin was observed to be relatively ineffective against post-entry spread for all viruses examined. tannins hypothesized to bind to viral glycoproteins on these viruses and the cell surfaces of infected cells. tannins may target more than one step of infection, including attachment, membrane fusion, and cell to cell spread. some antiviral therapies have proven successful, but treatment of many pathogenic viral infections have yet to be developed or approved. broad-spectrum antivirals using CHLA and PUG or their structure as lead compounds could be useful. HCMV, HCV, DENV, MV, and RSV effectively prevented infections by viruses using GAG-assisted entry. these natural molecules could serve as new therapeutic agents and help limit infections by viruses for which vaccines or FDA-licensed drugs do not yet exist. authors declare that they have no competing interests. Huh-7.5 cells were electroporated with full-length HCV replicon RNA. initial virus plaques were allowed to form in the subsequent infections. CHLA, PUG, Heparin, and DMSO control were added to the overlay medium for an additional incubation time. representative virus plaques/foci are shown after three independent experiments were performed.
