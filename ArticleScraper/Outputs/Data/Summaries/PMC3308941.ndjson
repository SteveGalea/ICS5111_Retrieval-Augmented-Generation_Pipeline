{"summary": "the order Mononegavirales comprises the non-segmented, negative sense, single-stranded RNA viruses in the family Filoviridae along with the families Rhabdoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Bornaviridae. infection with EBOV or MARV causes severe and often fatal hemorrhagic fever (HF) with case fatality rates ranging from 23\u201390% depending on the strain and/or species. the filoviruses contain an RNA genome, approximately 19 Kb in length. it encodes seven proteins that are arranged from 3\u2032 to 5\u2032: nucleoprotein (NP); virion protein (VP40; VP30; VP24; and the polymerase protein (L) the EBOV species express two extra nonstructural proteins from the GP gene referred to as soluble (s)GP [2] and small soluble (ss)GP [21] vectors have been developed as vaccine candidates against many important human pathogens such as influenza virus [24], human immunodeficiency virus [25], [26], [27], measles virus [28], [29], respiratory syncytial virus [30], papillomavirus [31], [32], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [33], and HF viruses such as Lassa, EBOV, and MARV [34]. the rVSV filo the rVSV filovirus GP vectors have been used in over 80 NHPs with no signs of toxicity as a result of vaccination. the rVSV filovirus GP vectors have been used in over 80 NHPs with no signs of toxicity as a result of vaccination [8], [9], [11], [12], [18], [35]. the use of the rVSV filovirus GP vectors as vaccines and/or postexposure treatments in humans requires further safety testing. the vaccine is replication-competent and there is potential for VSV neurovirulence (NV), as has been reported in rodents [41], [42], [43], [44], [45], [46], [47], [48], macaques [49], cattle, sheep, and horses [50]. rVSV-MARV-GP and rVSV-MARV-GP were recovered from cDNA. all viruses were propagated by infecting vero cells at a multiplicity of infection of 0.01 and collecting supernatants when cells showed cytopathic effects. rVSVs were clarified of cell debris and aliquoted for use in the study. cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) (4\u20137 Kg) were purchased from Charles River Laboratories (Wilmington, MA) all animals ranged in age from 4 to 6 years with the exception of two animals (67-01, 68-01) which were 18 years in age. all animal work adhered to the regulations outlined in the USDA Animal Welfare Act. the three primary inoculates consisted of 1107 PFU of either rVSV-wt (n = 3), rVSV-ZEBOV-GP (n = 7), or rVSV-MARV-GP (n = 7) in 150 l of 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) in Dulbecco's modified Eagle media. a small piece of gel foam was placed in the burr hole and direct pressure was used to achieve mean corpuscular volume, mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were determined from blood samples collected in tubes containing EDTA. concentrations of albumin, amylase, globulin, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyltransferase, lactate dehydrogenase, glucose, cholesterol, total protein, total bilirubin, direct sections of FC, BG, OC, TH, TH, CB, brain stem (BS) and SC were analyzed. histopathologic changes consistent with NV were double-blind scored. scores for brain regions were collectively represented as single number. RNA was extracted from swabs (Virus RNA kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and tissue sections (RNeasy kit, Qiagen) and TaqMan PCR for the rVSV genome was developed using primers and a probe that target the intergenic region (between M and G on the VSV genome) the rVSV M probe primer (Applied Biosystems, Carlsbad, CA) had the sequence 6-carboxyfluorescein (5FAM)-5\u2032 in nasal, oral, and rectal swabs (day 0, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21), blood (day 0, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21), non-neural tissues (spleen, liver, kidney, heart, axillary lymph node, and adrenal gland) virus titers were determined by conventional plaque assay on Vero cell monolayers. the rVSV preparations were assessed for the presence of endotoxin using the endosafe\u00ae-portable test system (PTS) each virus preparation was diluted 1100 in Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) Reagent Water (LRW) per manufacturer's directions. positive controls showed that the tests were valid. the animals were sedated with Ketamine HCl administered i.m., intubated, and placed on O2/Isoflurane. a saphenous catheter was placed and NaCl infused at 10 ml/hr. the animals head was shaved and surgically prepared. blood from phlebotomies was monitored for hematology from whole blood. daily cage side neurological exams were conducted. each animal received an overall impairment score (0\u20134). Tissues from five brain regions (FC), occipital cortex (OC), cerebellum (CB), thalamus (TH) and basal ganglia (BG) and three spinal cord regions (SC) were collected in 10% neutral-buffered formalin. after one week fixation, the brain was hemisectioned into right and left hemispheres. sections of FC, BG, OC, TH, CB, brain stem (BS) and SC rVSV TaqMan PCR assay to assess viral loads in nasal, oral, and rectal swabs (day 0, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21), blood (day 0, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 21), tissues (spleen, liver, kidney, heart, axillary lymph node, and adrenal gland) rVSV genomes and antigenomes were assayed in triplicate using CFX96 detection system. RNA from rVSV-wt stocks was extracted and the number of rVSV genomes was calculated using Avogadro's number and the molecular weight of the rVSV genome. two macaques from the rVSV-wt control group (67-01 and 56-09) developed progressive neurological signs including ataxia, proprioceptive deficits, and tremors. one of the rVSV-wt animals (362-09) did not show any discernable neurological signs. 56-09 was euthanized at day 5 post inoculation with a clinical score of 3. The animal was assigned a clinical score of 4 for the remainder of the 21 day experimental period. rVSV and rVSV RNA in swabs, blood, and tissues were prepared for virus and RNA isolation. three animals from the rVSV-ZEBOV-GP group also had detectable levels of rVSV RNA in nasal (357-09), oral (358-09), and rectal (352-09, 358-09) swabs at different times post inoculation with only 357-09 having virus isolated from the nasal swab at day 2 post inoculation. none of the animals had detectable levels of rVSV RNA in any blood samples taken FC-L = left frontal cortex, OC-L = left occipital cortex, FC-R = right occipital cortex, OC-R = right, occipital cortex, CSC = cervical spinal cord, LN = lymph node. rVSV vaccine inoculation occurred in left hemisphere. 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 0 68-01 21 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 0 359-09 21 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 0 rVSV-wt 56-09* 6 4/4 4/4 3/2 1/1 2/2 3 67-01** 5 2/3 2/1 0/0 0/0 0/0 0 0 0 rVSV-MARV-GP 52-09 21 0/1 1/0 1/0 0/0 0/0 0 57-09 21 0/0 0/0 0/0 0 59-09 21 0/0 0/0 0/0 0 61-09 21 0/0 0/0 0/0 0/0 0 61-09 21 0/0 0/0 0/ lesions were most pronounced in the cortices and the basal ganglia. lesions consisted of marked perivascular cuffs and parenchymal aggregates of lymphocytes, macrophages, and fewer plasma cells. gliosis was marked in regions of intense inflammation. seven animals received rVSV-ZEBOV-GP had mild histologic changes. one animal (363-09) lacked parenchymal lesions in the brain and spinal cord. 6 of the 7 animals (352-09, 354-09, 357-09, 358-09, 360-09, 361-09) had rare, focal areas of meningeal inflammation in various cerebral sections. rVSV-MARV-GP IT inoculation had varied histology. two animals (57-09, 61-09) had mild lesions in the cortex. another animal (364-09) had similar perivascular infiltrates. cynomolgus macaques were inoculated by IT inoculation with 1107 PFU of either rVSV-ZEBOV-GP (n = 7, Fig. 1A), rVSV-MARV-GP (n = 7, Fig. 1A), or vehicle control (n = 4). each animal received two inoculations, one per hemisphere, with the left hemisphere receiving the experimental inoculation and the right hemisphere rVSV-wt 56-09 was euthanized at day 6 post inoculation with a clinical score of 3.
