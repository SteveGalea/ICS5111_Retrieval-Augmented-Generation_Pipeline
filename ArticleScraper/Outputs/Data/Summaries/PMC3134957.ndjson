{"summary": "in the elderly, respiratory viral infections still cause significant morbidity and mortality. up to 40% of non-pneumonic lower respiratory illnesses have been linked to respiratory viral infection. in the united states, an estimated 54,000 annual deaths have been attributed to the influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV) the most severe epidemics have been caused by the influenza A virus. in 1918-1919 the H1N1 virus pandemic resulted in an estimated 50 to 100 million deaths. hypoxia and chest radiographs consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome are characteristic of patients requiring intensive care. if death occurs, it follows approximately more than one week after the onset of symptoms and mortality correlate with high virus titers. elderly institutionalized persons may fall ill, 31% may develop radiographically confirmed pneumonia and 50% may die. in the elderly, MPV infections are likely to be less severe than RSV infection and influenza [40], 42-44. coronaviruses NL63 and HKU1 were identified in samples of patients with respiratory symptoms in 2005-2006 [18, 21, 22, 44, 51, 52]. NL63 and HKU1 have primarily been associated with mild upper respiratory tract infections, but severe lower respiratory tract infections have also been reported [51, 52]. HBoV has been associated with upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children [62-66], but very little is known about HBoV infections among elderly people. HBoV has also been detected in the feces, in 1-9% of small children with or without gastrointestinal or respiratory symptoms [67-70], as well as in river and sewage water. two major genetic groups, A and B, and 99 HRV serotypes exist. PCR has markedly increased the detection rates of HRV infections. in long-term care facilities HRV may cause serious morbidity and mortality, and goes often unrecognized. virus has circulated at a rate similar to those of the HRV-A and -B groups [24, 98, 99] and is the cause for almost half of all HRV-associated hospitalizations in children. the prevalence of the respiratory KI- and WU-polyomaviruses is 2-7% in patients with respiratory symptoms [25, 26]. s are potentially oncogenic and can persist in human tissues. a single TTV infection may persist for years and cause chronic viremia. a single TTV infection may persist for years and cause chronic viremia. elderly patients have probably lower amounts of respiratory secretions and lower viral loads as compared to children. nasopharyngeal swabs, aspirates or washes are traditionally used in children but are not well tolerated in older adults or older people. a further challenge to the diagnostics of viral illness is optimal sampling. a rapid antigen detection test is relatively sensitive for detection of the influenza virus in elderly patients. during outbreaks up to 77% are detected by rapid antigen testing of culture positive samples. sensitivity may be only 8-22% in patients!80 years of age. positive PCR results are clinically relevant at least as far as HRV is concerned. identification of HRV correlates with respiratory symptoms, dual HRV infections are rare. prevalence of recurrent or persistent respiratory viral infections is low (3-4%). there is a paucity of accurate data on the link between the causes of death of elderly and the age-associated changes in the immune system. there are no specific treatments or vaccines available to combat the new viruses. there is no clinical need for a viral diagnosis. new respiratory viruses or viral strains include influenza A virus H5N1 and H1N1, MPV, SARS-, NL63- and HKU1-CoV, HBoV, HRV-C and \u2013D. viruses may be detectable in the airways for varying periods of time also after the acute phase."}
