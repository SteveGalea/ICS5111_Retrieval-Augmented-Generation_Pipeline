{"summary": "we characterized a lineage of BG with a long history of use as a simulant for biological warfare (BW) agents. the ability to differentiate signatures of deliberate adaptation and selection from natural variation is lacking for most bacterial agents. the results demonstrate the power of whole-genome and modern systems-level approaches to characterize microbial lineages. Bacillus atrophaeus is a soil-dwelling, non-pathogenic, aerobic spore-forming bacillus related to B. subtilis. it has played an integral role in the biodefense community as a simulant for biological warfare and bioterrorism events. the selected strains span more than six decades of development, use, and transfer of BG between various institutions and laboratories. the selected strains span more than six decades of development, use, and transfer of BG between various institutions and laboratories. the 1013 lineage, originally founded from the 1942 strain, was extensively passaged by serial transfer every 12\u201318 months on agar slants for 30 years. unless otherwise indicated, strains were grown using LB agar plates, LB agar brothor tryptic agar containing 5% sheep's blood. morphotype ATCC 49822-2 49822, Minor morphotype ATCC NRS-356 Archival isolate U. Wisconsin Figure 1. samples had been maintained as suspensions of viable spores. the first assembly contained 25contigs in 25scaffolds. the newbler consensus sequences were computationally shredded into 1.5 kb overlapping fake reads. possible mis-assemblies were corrected using gapResolution. the total size of the genome is 4 168 266 bp and the final assembly is based on 454 draft data which provides an average 33.4 coverage of the genome. the complete sequence and WGS were deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank under accession numbers listed in Table 2. The WGS versions described in this paper are the first versions, e.g. AEFM01000000. the raw 454 reads from the 1942 isolate were mapped to the finished sequence using the GSMapper tool in newbler (Roche) the raw 454 reads from the 1942 isolate were mapped to the finished sequence to assess error bias in the 454 process. 454Draft sequences appear smaller than 1942 due to collapse of repeat regions. average read length of this sample was considerably lower (239 versus >300) for other genomes in this dataset. confirmatory sequencing of SNP/Indels Nineteen loci were re-sequenced from PCR products by standard Sanger dye-terminator methods. resequencing of the apparent mutation at position 1486408revealed mixed genotypesin several isolates that are artifacts of a large duplication in the 1942 chromosome. 1013-2 and 49822 were analyzed in order to map the phylogenetic relationships of these isolates to other Bacillus species. the pair-wise comparison of the rank of n-mers within two different genomes is then used to compute an information-based genetic distance. the sum of the differences in rank for all possible n-mers is weighted by an entropy factor. phenotype microarray data were computed by adding all OmniLog values at all time points for each of the 1200 distinct phenotypes produced from the OmniLog software. the ratio for each AUC was calculated between the 6 query strains (Detrick-1, Detrick-2, Detrick-3, 1013-1, 1013-2, and Dugway) five representative viewing fields were counted from each strain for each experiment. a mixed analysis of variance was used to compare the percent sporulation between Detrick 1 and Detrick 2 and 1013. the natural log of the percent sporulation was taken to obtain a normal distribution of the residual error. var. globigii strain [14], derived from \u201cCamp Detrick Red Strain\u201d, Minor morphotype ATCC 9372-2 9372, Dominant morphotype ATCC 1013-1 1942 Vogel in vitro passaged variant U.

PM1-10 contain single wells for each growth condition. PM11-20 contain quadruplicate wells for each condition. assays of strains were grown for two days on TSA plates containing SBA. cell mass was scraped using an inoculating loop (1 l) from the streak. phase-bright free sporesand phase-dark vegetative cells were counted. it is not clear whether BG or B. subtilis subsp. subtilis was supplied, or whether this material was delivered. original records describing in detail the maintenance of the strains during the period 1942\u20131955 were destroyed as per US Army policy at the time. original records describing in detail the maintenance of the strains during the period 1942\u20131955 were destroyed as per US Army policy at the time. a period of approximately 30 years allowed us to compare the genomic signatures of deliberate selection with the effects of long-term in vitro passage. a sample of strain NRS-356 [13], mentioned as a possible parent strain in correspondence between various academic laboratories and Camp Detrick, was also obtained from the same source as the 1942 \u201cVogel\u201d strain. the isolates were subsampled, germinated on LB plates, screened for colony morphology variation. intra-strain colony morphology variation was particularly dramatic in the in vitro passaged 1013 and ATCC9372 isolates. one variant of each lineage had lost the production of color on LB orSBAplates. IBGD using whole-genome sequences (N-mer length >4) supported the identification of B. subtilis 168 as the closest relative among sequenced bacterial genomes. primary amino acid sequences of RAST-annotated proteins are on average 72% (median 83%) identical between B. atrophaeus and B. subtilis. two additional ATCC isolates of B. atrophaeus (49337 and 6537) were distinguishable from var. globigii on the basis of very high SNP/indel counts. the distinguishing genomic features of var.atrophaeus strains and the delineation of the B. atrophaeus clade from B. subtilis will be published elsewhere. morphology and pigmentation variations in 1013-2 and 1013-2 have been shown to have dramatic effects on spreading motility on semisolid media, on biofilm formation [34], [36] and low-grade hemolytic activity. de novo assembled draft sequence from 1942 isolate as template for subsequent analysis of SNPs and small indels in the other \u201cmilitary\u201d isolates. the two colony morphology variants of ATCC9372 each exhibited distinct mutation profiles indicating that the reference strain is in fact a mixed population of at least two genetically distinct substrains. a) Whole-genome shotgun sequences of the other strains were mapped to the assembled contigs of the 1942 strain using Newbler.

Discussion Bacillus atrophaeus has historically been grouped with B. subtilis. we mapped the 454 datasets for all of the isolates back to the finished sequence that was generated using the same DNA. these are currently being verified and the final sequence will be updated. the origin of ATCC 49822 is not as clear, but a publication from that era suggests a possible common origin at the University of Wisconsin [43] the BG isolates were \u201cenhanced\u201d by researchers at Camp Detrick. the initial step appears to have been the adaptation of a strain to growth in corn steep liquor, an acidic medium rich in protein and lactate. the robust growth of the Detrick strains relative to 1942 is likely due to mutations in mmgD or a short-chain 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase. mmgD gene can complement gltA (citrate synthase) mutant of E. coli. alteration of function of mmgD may have predisposed the lactate-adapted strain to acquisition of a hypersporulating phenotype. the species may have an intrinsic predisposition to evolving such a phenotype in vitro. the spo0F(H101R) mutation is distinct from a separate spo0F(A98P) mutation present in the in vitro passaged 1013 isolates. the amino acid sequence of B. atrophaeus Spo0F is identical to that of B. subtilis but for two conservative substitutions it is likely to have very similar if not identical biochemical properties. Aspo0F(H101A) allele results in a sporulation-proficient strain that throws off sporulation-deficient papillae. the same mutation has been shown to suppress the spo phenotype of a strain containing a defective kinA allele. the 1013-1 lineage exhibits a hypersporulating phenotype even more pronounced than spo0F strains in the \u201cmilitary\u201d lineage. the presence of several other mutations within this lineage confounds the attribution of the hypersporulating phenotype to this allele at this time. sporulation is highly energy-intensive and irreversible once commenced. mutants that delay sporulation would out-compete wild-type cells during repeated passage in vitro in the absence of other selection pressures. this may not be universally the case, since gain-of-function mutations in sporulation may compete favorably with wild-type cells. experimental strain of B. subtilis was never heat-shocked during its many transfers. the 1013 lineage was never heat-shocked during its many transfers. in vitro culture of the 1942 strain following its isolation for an unknown period by the University of Wisconsin might have selected for a hyposporulating variant. the strains analyzed in this study suggest strong selective pressures on the genes in the sporulation pathway. more carefully controlled studies should be carried out to determine the dynamics of in vitro evolution and adaptation of spore-forming organisms. it is not immediately clear why \u201cmilitary\u201d isolates would have lost the catalase activity characteristic of the parental isolate. new techniques of allele quantitation within populations by mass spectrometry [73], real-time PCR [74], and census-by-sequencing [68], [75] may be possible to quantitate accurately rare alleles within any given microbial population. the results from sequencing two strains of BACI051 in this study provide evidence of such hidden diversity.
