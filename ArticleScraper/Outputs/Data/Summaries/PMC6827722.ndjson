{"summary": "ARIs are the leading cause of death worldwide, especially among children. the majority of these infections in children are of viral etiology. the burden is especially high in children where ARIs are responsible for 11\u201322% of deaths. a study by fendrik et al. estimated the total economic impact of non-influenza-related viral RTIs in the united states at $40 billion annually. ARIs are associated with the greatest amount of excess use of antibiotics that has led to unprecedented increase in antimicrobial drug resistance. an ARI was defined as an acute infection of the upper and lower respiratory airways. Recruited patients had fever, cough, sore throat, rhinorrhea, headache, conjunctivitis, wheezing, dyspnea. a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. an ARI was defined as an acute infection of the upper and lower respiratory airways. an ARI was defined as an acute infection of the upper and lower respiratory airways. a respiratory sample was collected and stored at 80\u00b0C for viral assessment. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the AUBMC. a 200 l aliquot of each specimen was used for nucleic extraction. descriptive statistics were presented to summarize the study variables of interest as counts and percentages for the categorical variables and as medians and Interquartile Range (IQR) for the continuous ones. the Chi-square test was used to calculate the association between two categorical variables and as counts and percentages for the categorical variables. 116 of the 221 ARI episodes were confirmed to be of viral etiology being positive for at least one of the virus targets tests. the majority (n=103; 88%) of viral ARI episodes were observed in children under 6-year of age. female 49 (42.2) 6 (33.3) 5 (38.5) 6 (25) 1 (33.3) 20 (44.4) 35 (43.2) 20 (40.8) Male 67 (57.8) 12 (66.7) 8 (61.5) 18 (75) 2 (66.7) 25 (55.6) 46 (56.8) 29(59.2) Underlying conditions: Asthma 18 (15.5) 3 (16.7) 4 (30.8) 3 (12.5) 1 (33.3) 7 (15.6) 12 (14.8) 9 (18.4) Cystic 188 viruses were detected in the study population. Rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common virus detected in 81 (69.8%) patients followed by coxsackie virus and echovirus (CVEV) which were detected as one target. the most frequent viral co-infections involved two viruses (n=33), 10 cases had a triple infection, 5 had four viruses detected, and one case had five viruses. hMPV and INFB were detected in 9 samples, and all were co-infected. correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) to simplify the analysis, we treated subtypes or genotypes of a virus as a single group (e.g. RSV for RSVA and RSVB, etc.) Having an underlying condition or receiving chemotherapy or a course of antibiotics were not found to be a risk factor for having a viral etiology. the results of the multivariate model showed that CVEV was independently associated with rhinorrhea (OR: 4.73; CI: 1.59 \u2013 14.07) compared to none-RhV patients controlling for CVEV. however, this was not statistically significant. 116 of the 221 ARI episodes were confirmed to be of viral etiology being positive for at least one of the virus targets tests. the majority (n=103; 88%) of viral ARI episodes were observed in children under 6-year of age. 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0) Rhinovirus (RhV) was the most common virus detected in 81 (69.8%) patients followed by coxsackie virus and echovirus (CVEV) which were detected as one target in the panel in 45 (38.8%) patients. coinfection with more than one virus was detected in 49 (42.9%) patients. the most frequent co-infections involved two viruses (n=33), 10 cases had a triple infection, 5 had four viruses detected, and one case had five viruses. hMPV and INFB were detected in 9 samples, and all were co-infected. correlation is significant at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) underlying conditions and clinical presentation We then analyzed the correlation between each of the viral etiologies or co-infection with the underlying conditions. Having an underlying condition or receiving chemotherapy or a course of antibiotics were not found to be a risk factor for having a viral etiology or co-infection. a multivariate logistic regression model was used to examine the correlates of rhinorrhea in the study patients. the results of the multivariate model showed that CVEV was independently associated with rhinorrhea compared to none-CVEV patients controlling for RhV. coinfection rate in our study (42.9%) was higher than that previously reported in Lebanon (37%), Qatar (21.4%), and Egypt (10.8%). this incongruence could be because CVEV, which was frequently detected with other viruses in our study, was not screened in the previous studies from the region. coinfections and the large number of respiratory viruses involved make challenging to study the effect of coinfection on disease outcome in a clinical setting. there is a need for developing in vitro or in vivo models to allow a better understanding of coinfections."}
