{"summary": "the most effective approaches to prevention and control measures against influenza disease are vaccination and antiviral therapy. however, owing to antigenic variation of influenza viruses and individual differences in host immunity, the influenza vaccine can be less than effective. in recent years, it has been recognized that influenza viruses can directly affect the host. influenza virus genome is segmented, thus re-assorting among different virus strains readily occurs. influenza virus RNA often does not function correctly during replication. new influenza subtypes can easily emerge, leading to influenza epidemics. ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) (10) are a multifunctional protein whose transmembrane domain plays a critical role in ion channel activity. these proteins inhibit viral replication by blocking the ion channel at the stage of virus entry into cells. they inhibit the function of virus-coded RNA polymerases or prevent the release of progeny virions from infected cells. mortality rate of highly pathogenic avian influenza A (H5N1) virus is >60%. influenza A (H7N9) virus has a mortality rate of about 40%. influenza virus continues to be a major threat to human health and public safety. adhesion, multiplication, and release of influenza virus in epithelial cells can damage the barrier function of the respiratory tract mucosa. viral replication exposes the basement membrane, which is rich in fibers that connect proteins, causing respiratory pathogens to have high-affinity binding to proteins. the NA protein of influenza virus can promote viral release from infected cells and help the virus spread in the respiratory tract. phagocytic cells lead to NLRP3 signaling activation, interleukin (IL)-1 production, and recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the infection site. Dysfunction of the chemokine and cytokine response is associated with severe avian influenza virus infection (17,33), which may contribute to disease severity (34). similar findings have been observed in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza (37) cytokine levels increase after influenza virus infection, which can help clear the virus from host cells. this increase may lead to an imbalance in the host regulatory network, leading to a cytokine storm, which can cause more serious conditions such as ARDS and MODS. adhesion, multiplication, and release of influenza virus in epithelial cells can damage the barrier function of the respiratory tract mucosa. this process damages the integrity of the normal epithelial cell layer and enhances bacterial colonization. viral replication exposes the basement membrane, which is rich in fibers that connect proteins, causing respiratory pathogens to have high-affinity binding. phagocytic cells lead to NLRP3 signaling activation, interleukin (IL)-1 production, and recruitment of neutrophils and monocytes to the infection site. Dysfunction of the chemokine and cytokine response is associated with severe avian influenza virus infection (17,33), which may contribute to disease severity (34). similar findings have been observed in patients with severe influenza A (H1N1)pdm09 and seasonal influenza (37) proinflammatory cytokine levels increase after influenza virus infection, which can help clear the virus from host cells. however, this increase may lead to an imbalance in the host regulatory network, leading to a cytokine storm. class of antiviral drug is M2 ion channel protein inhibitors (M2 inhibitors) they target the influenza virus M2 protein and can inhibit the replication of influenza virus by interfering with the M2 protein ion channel activity. other antivirals include hemagglutinin inhibitors, such as ribavirin, and traditional Chinese medicine. viral resistance has been shown to reduce the activity of antivirals such as amantadine and rimantadine. in 2003 and 2004, the frequency of adamantane-resistant A (H3N2) viruses in china increased substantially to 57.5% and 73.8%, respectively. combination therapy can produce synergistic effects, increase anti-influenza virus activity, reduce the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains. combination therapy can reduce the use of individual antivirals and may have dose-related drug toxicity and adverse effects. the new antiviral strategies target HA (69,70), RNA polymerase (71-73), NP (74) and NS1 (75); however, no anti-influenza drugs targeting NS1 are under clinical development. there are new developments in NA inhibitors, such as laninamivir. the use of inflammation inhibitors in the treatment of severe viral pneumonia has come from the experience of SARS treatment in Guangzhou, China. the use of glucocorticoids in the treatment of severe viral pneumonia has come from the experience of SARS treatment. there is no clear consensus on corticosteroid use in the treatment of influenza A (H5N1 or H1N1) infection. treatment with convalescent plasma in patients with H1N1 infection can effectively reduce respiratory tract viral load, serum cytokine response, and mortality. traditional Chinese herbal medicine (TCM) has an innate advantage in that it can target the virus and the host simultaneously, offering more effective inhibition of host inflammatory responses induced by influenza virus infection. many TCMs have been shown to have anti-influenza effects, such as the herb Radix isatidis, honeysuckle, forsythia, and compound formulas Lianhua-Qingwen and MaxinShigan Tang. indirubin, clemastanin B, alkaloids, lignans, and flavonoids have been isolated from R. isatidis. it is unclear whether indirubin has a direct effect on influenza virus in vitro. lignan lariciresinol-4-O--d-glucopyrano-side, another lignan, exhibited strong anti-influenza virus A activity and decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression via inhibition of the NF-B pathway in influenza A virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells (107). a deeper understanding of new anti-influenza strategies using combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies is required. a clinical trial also found that maxingshigan-yinqiaosan (a TCM) reduced the time to fever resolution in patients with H1N1 influenza virus infection, as compared with treatment using oseltamivir alone (94). there is also evidence that TCM significantly reduces the severity of illness and duration of symptoms including cough, sore throat, and fatigue (93). antivirals include amantadine and rimantadine. other antivirals include hemagglutinin inhibitors. traditional Chinese medicine contains anti-influenza activity. viral resistance has been shown to reduce the activity of antivirals such as amantadine and rimantadine. however, in 2003 and 2004, the frequency of adamantane-resistant A (H3N2) viruses in china increased substantially to 57.5% and 73.8%, respectively. combination therapy can reduce the use of individual antivirals. oseltamivir-ribavirin combination therapy has been found to be less effective than zanamivir monotherapy for seasonal influenza A (H3N2) virus and H1N1 virus (65) the new antiviral strategies target HA (69,70), RNA polymerase (71-73), NP (74) and NS1 (75); however, no anti-influenza drugs targeting NS1 are under clinical development. corticosteroids are the most widely used and effective adjuvant therapy. glucocorticoids can reduce alveolar effusion, capillary permeability, and the inflammatory response of the lung parenchyma and interstitium, to shorten the course of severe viral pneumonia. anti-inflammatory therapy has become an important component of anti-influenza strategies. the optimal anti-inflammatory drug, duration of treatment, and timing of treatment remain unclear. traditional Chinese herbal medicine has an innate advantage in that it can attenuate excessive proinflammatory responses and limiting symptoms and tissue damage associated with infection. the development of novel therapeutic agents from TCM is a promising approach for anti-influenza strategies. the herb Radix isatidis (R. isatidis), honeysuckle, forsythia, and compound formulas Lianhua-Qingwen and MaxinShigan Tang have been shown to have anti-influenza effects. polysaccharides, indirubin, clemastanin B, alkaloids, lignans, and flavonoids have been isolated from R. isatidis. underlying mechanism may include direct competitive binding to the HA of the virus, thereby inhibiting viral invasion and replication. lariciresinol-4-O--d-glucopyrano-side, another lignan, exhibited strong anti-influenza virus A activity and decreased proinflammatory cytokine expression via inhibition of the NF-B pathway in influenza A virus-infected alveolar epithelial cells (107). a deeper understanding of new anti-influenza strategies using combined antiviral and anti-inflammatory therapies is required. clinical trials indicate that TCMs are a good support in oseltamivir treatment that can reduce the duration time of fever. there is also evidence that TCM significantly reduces the severity of illness and duration of symptoms including cough, sore throat, and fatigue. however, data are lacking regarding whether treatment with TCMs plus oseltamivir is effective."}
