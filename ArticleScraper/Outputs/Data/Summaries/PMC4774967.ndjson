{"summary": "influenza affects 32,000 individuals in the us and 600,000 worldwide each year. the elderly account for up to 80% of hospitalisations and 95% of influenza associated mortality. the elderly account for up to 80% of hospitalisations and 95% of influenza associated mortality. a higher dose of live attenuated influenza vaccine is necessary to induce protective immunity in aged mice compared to young adult mice. the use of replication incompetent vaccine vectors derived from Venezuelan Equine Encephalitis virus carrying influenza transgenes protected aged mice from lethal homologous and heterologous influenza challenge [29]. the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Massachusetts Medical School approved the animal protocol used in this study. Mice were inoculated intranasally with 4x105 p.f.u. of influenza H1N1 virus diluted in 50l of sterile PBS. Fluzone + 10g CpG (FZ+CpG; 40l of FZ, 60 l sterile PBS), 10g CpG (CpG; 10l of CpG, 90 l PBS) or PBS alone (100l PBS) were administered as an intra-muscular vaccination into the caudal thigh muscle. marrow derived macrophages (BMM) and dendritic cells (BMDC) were generated. femoral bone was harvested from either young adult (6\u20138 weeks) or aged (18\u201324 months) mice. anti-Influenza IgG detection and HAI assay IgG detection Microtiter plates were coated with 50HA/well UV inactivated H1N1 A/California/09 influenza overnight at 4\u00b0C. plates were washed and then blocked with 10%BSA/PBS and sera from immune or nave mice was added and incubated for 3 hrs at room temperature. 0.05 Mice Young adult (6\u20138 weeks) and middle aged (8\u20139 months) male and female C57BL/6J were purchased from the national Institute of Ageing NIA. 0.05 Mice were aged in house to 18\u201324 months old or purchased from the national Institute of Ageing NIA. all mice received a high vaccine dose, corresponding to a total of 1.2 g of HA protein from each of the virus strains in the Fluzone\u00ae vaccine. all mice received a high vaccine dose, corresponding to a total of 1.2 g of HA protein from each of the virus strains in the vaccine. cells were fixed with BD Stabilizing FixativeTM (BD Biosciences) for analysis. data were collected on a BD FACSAriaTM equipped with Diva v7.0 and CS&T v2.0 software. med/MHCIIHi were induced by culturing with GM-CSF (20ng/ml) enriched RPMI/10% FBS medium. 1x106 cells were stimulated with 2.5g/ml of CpG (Invivogen) and/or 2g/ml of Fluzone for 12 hrs at 37\u00b0C. an equal volume of 1% chicken red blood cell suspension was added to all wells and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera to successfully inhibit CRBC agglutination was defined as the HAI titre of the serum sample. the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera to successfully inhibit CRBC agglutination was defined as the HAI titre of the serum sample. Graphpad Prism software performed non-parametric statistical analysis across no more than 2 groups of interest. CpG adjuvant improves efficacy of fluzone\u00ae vaccine to H1N1 challenge in young adult mice. single fluzone vaccination with or without adjuvants is non-protective in aged mice. young adult (6\u20138 weeks) and aged (18\u201324 months) were vaccinated with Fluzone (FZ), Fluzone+CpG (FZ+CpG) or left unvaccinated as controls. CpG adjuvant fails to improve efficacy of fluzone\u00ae vaccine to H1N1 challenge in aged mice Similar to young adult mice, aged mice (18\u201324 months; n = 5\u20138) vaccinated with FZ had positive anti-H1N1 IgG titres 4 weeks after immunization compared to unvaccinated mice, but no detectable HAI activity. Vaccinated aged mice showed slightly lower weight loss at each time point compared to unvaccinated controls following in vitro with FZ or FZ+CpG examined TNF- production and MHC class II cell surface expression. BMDCs from young adult mice were also responsive to activation by FZ, CpG alone and FZ+CpG. BMDCs from young adult mice showed strong up regulation of MHC class II and TNF- release. up regulation of MHC class II relative to unstimulated cells was measured using flow cytometry on (A) BMM and (D) BMDC. readings were taken as average of triplicate wells. results shown are mean values + S.D and are representative of 2 independent experiments. repeated vaccination with CpG+FZ provides fully protective immunity in young adult mice but limited protection in aged mice. young adult mice were vaccinated twice, 2 weeks apart, with fluzone (FZ x2), Fluzone+CpG (FZ+CpG) x2 or left unvaccinated as controls. Approximately 4 weeks later, all groups were challenged with 1x104 p.f.u of A/California/09 H1N1virus. young adult mice immunized twice with FZ+CpG have reduced influx of neutrophils present in the lungs at day 7 post infection. both vaccinated groups had a higher percentage of CD4+ cells present in the lung after infection, relative to unvaccinated controls. however only mice immunized twice with FZ+CpG had a significantly higher percentage of CD8+ T-cells in the lung following infection. CD3-/Ly6C+ and (B) CD3+/CD8+ T-cells were measured by flow cytometry in homogenates of the left lobe of the lung. n = 5 per group was determined day 7 post challenge using homogenates from the left lobe of the lung. equal volumes of lung homogenate were pooled from 5 mice in each group. mortality in the unvaccinated and unadjuvanted (FZ) groups reached 100%. mortality in the unvaccinated and unadjuvanted (FZ+CpG) groups reached 100%. compared to only 20% in the adjuvanted (FZ+CpG) group. weight loss (A) and (C) and survival (B) and (D) were monitored daily in young adult and aged mice respectively. CpG adjuvant fails to improve efficacy of Fluzone\u00ae vaccine to H1N1 challenge in aged mice. aged mice (18\u201324 months; n = 5\u20138) vaccinated with FZ had positive anti-H1N1 IgG titres 4 weeks after immunization compared to unvaccinated mice. we stimulated bone marrow derived macrophages (BMM) and dendritic cells (BMDC) from both young adult and aged mice in vitro with FZ or FZ+CpG. we examined TNF- production and MHC class II cell surface expression. young adult mice were vaccinated with FZ+CpG at 6 weeks and 2 weeks before challenge with A/California/09 H1N1 virus. young adult mice were fully protected from H1N1 IAV associated weight loss and mortality. both groups, (FZ+CpG) x2 and FZ x2, had comparable levels of IAV-specific IgG. however, HAI antibody levels were two times higher in the adjuvanted vs. the non-adjuvanted group (40 vs. 20) the same vaccine formulation and immunization schedule resulted in symptomless (asymptomatic) infection in young adult mice. this benefit may have been due to cell mediated responses induced by vaccination. protection in immunized young adult mice is associated with improved cellular immunity. five mice per group were sacrificed at day 7 post-infection. the frequency of neutrophils (CD3-/Ly6C+) and (B) CD3+/CD8+ T-cells was measured by flow cytometry in homogenates of the right lobe of the lung. all immunization protocols with or without adjuvant resulted in poorer protection in aged compared to young adult mice. the same immunization schedule (FZ+CpG) x2 doses which conferred full protection in young adult mice resulted in only partial protection (60% survival). MF59 adjuvanted Fluad induced higher HAI titres and longer antibody persistence in infants and young children. vaccine strategies designed, tested and approved in young adult cohorts may not have comparable results in the elderly."}
