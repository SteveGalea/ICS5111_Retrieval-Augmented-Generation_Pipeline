{"summary": "canine rabies has been eliminated in North America and many South American and European countries. but it is still the source of most human rabies cases in other areas. urbanization and lack of aggressive rabies elimination programs may have contributed to resurgence of canine rabies-associated human deaths in several provinces in china. monkeypox can spread from person to person after prolonged contact with a patient or indirectly through exposure to body fluids or fomites contaminated with the virus. in humans, monkeypox virus is less virulent and less transmissible than variola virus (9) filovirus infection is primarily limited to sporadic outbreaks in the african continent. recent infections of tourists from the united states and the united states have been documented (13,17) despite the low incidence of filovirus infections, their occurrence in outbreaks with high rates of death has prompted investments in enhancing surveillance mechanisms. in the united states, the number of human deaths from canine rabies has declined to an average of 3 cases per year during the last several decades. in the united states, the number of human deaths from rabies has declined to an average of 3 cases per year during the last several decades. monkeypox can spread from person to person after prolonged contact with a patient or indirectly through exposure to body fluids or fomites contaminated with the virus. in humans, monkeypox is less virulent and less transmissible than variola virus (9) anthrax in the united states is more commonly reported in animals than in humans (18,19) naturally occurring anthrax cases have been associated with direct contact with infected animals, occupational exposure during industrial processing of infected animals, and production or use of drums made from contaminated hides. hantavirus pulmonary syndrome was first identified in 1993 in the southwestern united states. pathologic examination was critical for characterizing the illness and contributed to discovery of the etiologic agent (22). autopsy and examination of biopsied tissues played a major role in the investigation of the bioterrorism-related anthrax cases in 2001 in the united states. surveillance and public health research of high-consequence pathogens are critical for identifying their natural reservoirs. studying molecular characteristics of these pathogens is critical to understanding their pathogenesis and ultimately to developing vaccines and antimicrobial drugs. maintaining a preparedness posture to tackle the challenges posed by the emergence or reemergence of some of these pathogens should remain a priority."}
