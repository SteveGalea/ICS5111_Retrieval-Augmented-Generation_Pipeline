{"summary": "the failure to develop antibiotics with a novel mechanism was not considered to be due to the inability of research teams to create a potent inhibitor of a new essential bacterial target. the failure was commonly found to be the challenge of developing these inhibitors into medicines with an appropriate balance of antibacterial activity, drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics properties, and safety. bacteria have established many defense systems to keep potentially toxic xenobiotics out or render them ineffective. many antibiotics bypass the membrane by traveling through porins, which are bacterial proteins that span the bacterial membranes. when exposed to an antibiotic, bacteria can down-regulate these porins or mutate them to reduce their ability to transport the antibiotic into the bacteria. the antibiotic may have exquisite activity against one species (e.g., K. pneumoniae) but may be much less active against another (e.g., P. aeruginosa) the physician often must assume the patient is infected by any of the bacteria common for that infection. a high dose is needed to cover the worst-case scenario. a dose of 75 mg/kg twice daily would be efficacious against the four common causative pathogens of community-acquired pneumonia a phase 1 study was conducted to determine the dose that will work in the worst-case scenario of a patient with the lowest PK exposure being infected with a strain that is least sensitive to the antibiotic. this led to a refined target dose of 1,500 mg BID (3,000 mgd1), which would ensure >90% of the population receive an exposure that would be effective at treating acute skin and skin structure infection. the high dose of antibiotics is evident when comparing doses of antibiotics with doses of other recently approved agents from different therapeutic areas. a patient with an intraabdominal infection with suspected MRSA could be given combination of three drugs. a yearly course of Zestril for heart disease totals 14.6 g. resistance, empirical therapy, and lack of new-class antibiotics have created quite a conundrum. traditional antibiotics need to be given at high doses to cover PK variability and all of the causative pathogens. but these high doses are given at or near their toxic threshold. researchers are investigating ways to increase influx by taking advantage of membrane transporters. this approach is validated by the approved antibiotic fosfomycin. a popular transporter that has been a target for many years is iron uptake. a consortium called TRANSLOCATION is researching passive and active penetration of small molecules into gram-negative bacteria. the challenge will be to identify a transporter that can be exploited by a common method that is transferable to several antibiotics with different mechanisms with minimal chemical optimization. effective inhibitors were identified in vitro, but we were not able to overcome the in vivo toxicity. this remains a compelling approach and could reduce the doses of new gram-negative antibiotics. this could also reduce the doses of new gram-negative antibiotics. the most advanced molecule utilizing this approach is a catechol-linked cephalosporin (cefiderocol) that is currently in clinical trials for gram-negative infections. this approach has mostly been applied to known antibiotic classes, but applying this approach to novel antibacterial leads targeting novel targets could be an important strategy. vaccines are among the most promising preventative methods to address the challenges of AMR. vaccines can directly prevent infections caused by devastating AMR pathogens. vaccines indirectly decrease the use of antibiotics by reducing the symptoms that usually trigger the use of antibiotics. in the late 1970s, recombinant DNA allowed the production of hepatitis B vaccine in yeast, thus allowing the large-scale production of a vaccine that can eliminate the infection and the related liver cancer worldwide. in the next two decades, this enabled the development of novel platforms to develop and produce vaccines. this includes the possibility to manipulate gram-negative bacteria to produce engineered outer membrane vesicles. 22 new vaccines have been licensed since 1980s. some of the most important came from genomics, adjuvants, synthetic biology, and structural biology. vaccines that can be technically developed include those against all major antimicrobial-resistant bacteria. the antigen selection process starts from the analysis of the genomic information on circulating strains. candidates are then expressed as recombinant proteins and tested in preclinical models for their ability to induce functional antibodies. the 4CMenB has recently been introduced in the united kingdom to all infants. juvanted influenza vaccines showed 22% improved efficacy in the elderly and increased protection in children from 43 to 86% (18, 19) juvanted influenza vaccines showed 22% improved efficacy in the elderly and increased protection in children from 43 to 86% (18, 19) several novel adjuvants named AS01, AS03, and AS04 have been licensed as part of innovative vaccines (20) novel small-molecule adjuvant targeting TLR7 has been extensively tested in preclinical models with very promising results. other adjuvants targeting surface-exposed (TLR1/2), endosomal (TLR3), or cytoplasmic (Rig I, DNA sensors) innate immune receptors have been successfully tested in preclinical models. existing glycoconjugate vaccines require complex manufacturing based on the isolation of polysaccharides from the pathogens, followed by a nonselective chemical conjugation to a recombinant protein carrier. this makes the process expensive and unsuitable for very complex vaccines or for low-income countries. the new Zealand OMV is produced through detergent extraction from bacterial culture. it induces antibodies that kill bacteria through a complement-mediated mechanism. the key to induce OMV release is to target genes responsible for stabilizing the link between the bacterial outer membrane and peptidoglycan. a second technological revolution of the 1980s was the development of glycoconjugate vaccines composed of bacterial polysaccharides covalently linked to a protein carrier. this technology allowed the development of vaccines against H. influenzae type B; the development of 7-, 10-, and 13-valent vaccines against pneumococcus; and tetravalent vaccines against meningococcus. these vaccines alone have been able to prevent the deaths and hospitalization of millions of children reverse vaccinology was named reverse vaccinology because it was the first time in the two centuries of vaccine history that scientists discovered new vaccines starting from the information in a computer. the technology was named reverse vaccinology because it was the first time in the two centuries of vaccine history that scientists discovered new vaccines starting from the information in a computer. the success of 4CMenB suggests that a similar antigen selection approach can be applied to AMR bacterial pathogens. aluminum salts had been the only adjuvants licensed for human use. in 1997, an oil-in-water emulsion was licensed to improve conventional influenza vaccines. MR, preclinical data suggest that adjuvants will contribute directly to AMR in the near future by providing new vaccines against bacterial infections. a vaccine to prevent reactivation of tuberculosis and a vaccine targeting nontypeable H. influenzae and Moraxella catharralis to prevent exacerbation in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) a revolutionary antigen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) by stabilizing the F protein of RSV in the prefusion conformation (26) this had been an impossible task using conventional technologies so far. similar approaches are being used to improve the outlook for HIV. bioconjugates may play a fundamental role in the future to prevent infection caused by dangerous AMR pathogens expressing polysaccharide antigens. a vaccine based on a homologous bacterial OMV has been administered to effectively prevent meningococcus B infections during an outbreak in new Zealand in 2004/2008. reverse vaccinology was the first time in the two centuries of vaccine history that scientists discovered new vaccines starting from the information in a computer. it was named reverse vaccinology because it was the first time in the two centuries of vaccine history that scientists discovered new vaccines starting from the information in a computer. this information is more complete than in the past, and now available for a large number of bacterial pathogens. the 4CMenB has been introduced in the united kingdom to all infants. the success of 4CMenB suggests that a similar antigen selection approach can be applied to AMR bacterial pathogens. aluminum salts had been the only adjuvants licensed for human use. a novel small-molecule adjuvant targeting TLR7 has been extensively tested in preclinical models with very promising results. other adjuvants targeting surface-exposed (TLR1/2), endosomal (TLR3), or cytoplasmic (Rig I, DNA sensors) have been successfully tested in preclinical models. antigen display on nanoparticles can be rationally designed to optimize protein density and formation of the correct multimers in the correct conformation. the resulting protein nanoparticles are immunogenic compared with soluble recombinant proteins and can be combined with novel adjuvants to obtain optimal antibody titers. bioconjugate vaccine can be produced in a single fermentation step. it is possible to use a protective antigen as a carrier without interfering with protective epitopes. bioconjugates may play a fundamental role in the future to prevent infection caused by dangerous AMR pathogens. phages are viruses that infect bacteria and are the most prominent life form on the planet. the common approach for bacterial therapy involves lytic phages, which are phages that result in cell lysis, and thus death of the bacterial cell. phages are specific for bacteria, so there is no impact on mammalian cells. researchers are investigating the potential to broaden the specificity of phages (34) this could reduce the number of phages needed per species and transform this approach. one group is developing a phage against P. aeruginosa to treat cystic fibrosis. another intriguing approach is to use phages as a delivery system. fecal matter transplants have been used to restore the microbiome of patients with C. difficile. unpleasant, but successful, fecal matter transplants have been used to restore the microbiome of patients with the disease. groups are creating treatments that consist of a defined combination of bacterial strains from different species. the microbiome is likely to provide a rich source of therapies for a wide range of diseases. a microbiome treatment for C. difficile infection in the gastrointestinal tract will be available in the near term. antibody therapy has been successfully applied to other therapeutic areas, such as inflammatory diseases, and broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are recently having an impact on HIV research. mAbs may have the best opportunity to successfully treat AMR. each mAb treatment will probably be limited to a specific species of bacteria. this will mean these treatments will be reserved for second- or third-line therapy once the infecting organism has been identified. researchers are investigating the potential to broaden the specificity of phages (34), which could reduce the number of phages needed per species. the next major challenge is how to get phages to the site of action since phages do not have favorable PK properties. fecal matter transplants have been used to restore the microbiome of patients with C. difficile. unpleasant, but successful, fecal matter transplants have been used to restore the microbiome of patients with the disease. the microbiome is likely to provide a rich source of therapies for a wide range of diseases. the lung microbiome may also offer opportunity to prevent respiratory infections, such as HAP, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and Pseudomonas in cystic fibrosis. antibody therapy has been successfully applied to other therapeutic areas. antibody therapy has been successfully applied to other therapeutic areas. acinetobacter, P. aeruginosa, or K. pneumoniae may be a more pragmatic approach than vaccination for these pathogens. each mAb will need to have its own clinical development path, which will greatly increase the cost of development. the downside is each mAb will need to have its own clinical development path. significant investment is needed to broaden the application of innovative vaccine platforms to additional pathogens. a coordinated effort in research and development of new antibiotics and vaccines can greatly advance our ability to control AMR."}
