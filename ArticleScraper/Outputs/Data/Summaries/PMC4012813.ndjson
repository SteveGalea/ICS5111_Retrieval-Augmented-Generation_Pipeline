{"summary": "environmental samples were collected from 575 livestock trailers before and after pigs were unloaded into holding pens, or lairages, at 6 harvest facilities. samples were collected during a period of 2\u20133 days at each facility during a period of 2\u20133 days. real-time reverse transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) was performed on nucleic acid extracts by using the Path-ID Multiplex One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Life Technologies) rRT-PCR was performed on conserved regions of the PEDV nucleocapsid protein gene. samples were gathered from 6 pig harvest facilities. environmental samples from 13 (34.2%) were negative for PEDV after unloading. pigs transported to harvest facility may not have been shedding PEDV. new data suggest that novel agents, such as PEDV, may be present in a country but remain undetected for an extended period. simple measures such as limiting contact between drivers and the collection point and requiring drivers to remain on trucks and out of the collection point may have a dramatic effect on limiting the transmission of novel agents."}
