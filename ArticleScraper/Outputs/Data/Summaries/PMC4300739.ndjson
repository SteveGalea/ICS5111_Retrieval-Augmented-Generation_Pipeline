{"summary": "coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause a variety of diseases in mammals and humans. these viruses often cause severe disease, but no therapeutic drugs and only a few vaccines have been developed to combat coronaviruses. it is critical to continue to identify potential drug targets and develop novel vaccine platforms and strategies to limit diseases induced by this group of viruses. nsp3 is a large protein consisting of numerous distinct domains separated by disordered linkers. the macrodomain is a globular domain containing central -sheets flanked by -helices that binds to various forms of ADP-ribose (4). it is conserved in all living species with 11 macrodomain-containing proteins encoded in the human genome alone (5). the cyclic nucleotide is converted to Appr-1\u2032\u2032-p by cyclic phosphodiesterase (CPD) and ultimately to ADP-ribose (ADR) by ADRP (11) however, Appr-1\u2032\u2032-p has not been detected in coronavirus-infected cells, and there is not a theoretical basis to explain its production during replication. the mutant virus was associated with reduced inflammatory cytokine production in vitro and in vivo. the ADRP domain did not appear to have a role in countering the interferon response because the mutant did not cause hepatitis in IFNAR/ mice. cDNA clone can be produced in large quantities, and infection can be launched in a highly efficient manner because transcription originates from a cytomegalovirus promoter. this allows viral RNA synthesis to occur in the nucleus following transfection, eliminating the need for in vitro RNA production steps necessary using some other types of coronavirus infectious clones (25). IFNAR/, tumor necrosis factor-negative (TNF/) and RAG1/ mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories. a synthetic DNA (Genscript) was constructed containing a 5\u2032 SmaI site followed by a CMV promoter fused to nucleotides 1 to 1991. the ligated full-length genomes and pBAC-JHMV 5\u20323\u2032 construct were digested with PacI and SanDI, ligated, and transformed into competent DH10B cells. transformants were again selected on LB-chloramphenicol plates, and colonies were screened by PCR and restriction digestion with EcoRI and EcoRV. representative clones of pBAC-JHMVIA and pBAC-JHMVSD were digested with EcoRI and EcoRV. expected banding pattern for EcoRI digestion is 14.5, 11, 7.7, and 6.3 kb. expected pattern from EcoRV digestion is 22.3, 12.6, 4.7, and 0.2 kb. recombinants were selected on LB-chloramphenicol-kanamycin plates. correct clones were amplified and treated with arabinose. resulting BACs were termed pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP and pBAC-JHMVSD-GFP. pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP was transformed into GS1783 E. coli cells. the I-SceI restriction site is 18 bp long and is not. a PCR product was generated containing 40 bp of unique sequence at each end homologous to nsp3 and 20 bp of overlapping sequence containing the desired mutation, AA4893\u20134894GC. the PCR product was transformed into GS1783 cells and recombined with pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP. rJ virus was grown on 17Cl-1 cells, and virus titers were determined on HeLa-MHVR cells. mice were sacrificed and perfused, and brains were collected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) brain-derived cells were blocked with 2.4G2 and then incubated with specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) or isotype controls. cells were analyzed using a FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., Ashland, OR) quantitative real-time PCR primers Gene Primer MHV nsp12 5\u2032-AGGGAGTTTGACCTTGTTCAG-3\u2032 5\u2032-ATAATGCACCTGTCATCCTCG-3\u2032 HPRT 5\u2032-GCGTCGATGATG-3\u2032 5\u2032-CTCGAGCAAGTCTCC-3\u2032 IFN- 5\u2032-CCCTATGGAGATGAGA-3\u2032 5\u2032-ACCCAGTGCTGGAAATTG-3\u2032 CCL2 5\u2032-CTTC ogen-free mice were purchased from the national cancer institute. IFNAR/, tumor necrosis factor-negative (TNF/) and RAG1/ mice were bred at the university of Iowa. the ligated full-length genomes and pBAC-JHMV 5\u20323\u2032 construct were then digested with PacI and SanDI. pBAC-JHMV 5\u20323\u2032 and a full-length JHMV ligated in vitro were digested with PacI and SanDI (ThermoScientific) representative clones of pBAC-JHMVIA and pBAC-JHMVSD were digested with EcoRI and EcoRV. expected banding pattern for EcoRI digestion is 14.5, 11, 7.7, and 6.3 kb. expected pattern from EcoRV digestion is 22.3, 12.6, 4.7, and 0.2 kb. recombinants were selected on LB-chloramphenicol-kanamycin plates. correct clones were amplified and treated with arabinose. resulting BACs were termed pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP and pBAC-JHMVSD-GFP. pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP was transformed into GS1783 E. coli cells. pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP was transformed into g1783 E. coli cells. a PCR product was generated containing 40 bp of unique sequence at each end homologous to nsp3 and 20 bp of overlapping sequence containing the desired mutation, AA4893\u20134894GC. correct clones were treated with arabinose during logarithmic growth to induce production of I-SceI. rJ virus was grown on 17Cl-1 cells, and virus titers were determined on HeLa-MHVR cells as previously described. mice were sacrificed and perfused, and brains were collected in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) RNA was isolated from 17Cl-1 cells or from brain homogenates. RNA was isolated from 17Cl-1 cells or from brain homogenates. qPCR was performed using a real-time PCR system. CT = CT(gene of interest) CT(HPRT) all results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as 2CT. all results are shown as a ratio to HPRT calculated as 2CT. the BAC clone contains the first 1,991 nucleotides of the JHM virus genome fused to a CMV promoter, a NotI site, and the last 1,197 nucleotides of the genome. the BAC clone contains a 25-nucleotide poly(A) stretch, the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme, and bovine growth hormone termination and polyadenylation sequences. three BAC clones that produced virus, i.e., one JHMVIA and two JHMVSD clones, were fully sequenced by Sanger sequencing using primers spaced approximately 500 nucleotides apart across the viral genome. plaques were observed 48 to 72 h after transfection and were identical in morphology and size to those of control rJ virus. rJ virus engineered using pBAC-JHMV is infectious and replicates in similar manner to other recombinant JHMVs. pBAC-JHMV DNA was transfected into DBT cells along with a plasmid expressing N protein. 5- to 6-week-old male B6 mice were infected with 4E4 PFU rJIA (A and C) and 8E3 PFU rJSD (B and D) intranasally. mice were monitored daily for survival and weight loss. rJIA and rJSD controls refer to viruses constructed using targeted recombination. pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP was inserted in place of a gene that is not required for viral replication in tissue culture or in mice (35) only pBAC-JHMVIA-GFP was used in subsequent studies. rJ virus mutated at residue 1347 (N1347A) is minimally attenuated in vitro. RNA was quantified by RT-qPCR with primers specific for genomic RNA. the normalized amount of viral transcript at 6 hpi during revN1347 infection was set to 1. the normalized ratio of revN1347 virus was set to 1. a PCR product containing a Kanr-I-SceI marker cassette flanked with overlapping sequence containing the desired mutation was inserted into the genome by intermolecular recombination. this allowed for intramolecular recombination, removing the marker cassette and resulting in a BAC that now contained the desired mutation. the wild-type sequence was reintroduced back into the mutant BAC clone using the same procedure. two separate clones of each virus were grown out and used in these assays. the difference in viral titers at 12 hpi reached 2- to 4-fold. the difference in viral gRNA levels at 12 hpi reached 2-fold. N1347A was rapidly outcompeted by WT (GFP) virus. by passage 3 only 10% of plaques were GFP positive. the WT (GFP+) virus was nearly as fit as WT (GFP) virus. rJ macrodomain is essential for virus-induced encephalitis. data were combined from two independent experiments (n = 13 in the revN1347 group and n = 14 in the N1347A group) to determine virus load in the brains of infected mice, B6 mice were infected intracranially and monitored for survival and weight loss for 14 days (n = 3 mice per group) revN1347-infected mice were moribund by 6 days p.i., losing 25% of their body weight. virus titers in the brain were 4-fold higher than in N1347A-infected animals at day 5 p.i. macrophages were largely positive for Ly6C. lower proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression and reduced recruitment of bone marrow macrophages into the brains of infected mice. mice infected with N1347A virus displayed occasional perivascular infiltrates. Combined results from two independent experiments are shown. results are representative of two independent experiments. the role of innate immune signaling in JHMV infection. we infected IFN-/ receptor-negative mice with revN1347 or N1347A. in IFNAR/ mice, N1347A virus was unable to cause lethal encephalitis. but did induce significant weight loss compared to wild-type mice. to determine if these differences reflect differences in IFN sensitivity, 17Cl-1 cells were treated with IFN- and infected with revN1347. cells were pretreated with indicated amounts of IFN- (PBL, Piscataway, NJ) cells were analyzed for infectious virus at 20 hpi by plaque assay. increased mortality in mice lacking T and B cells. even attenuated strains of JHMV are able to persist for several weeks in RAG1/ mice. two- to five-month-old mice were infected intranasally with revN1347 and N1347A. the mice were monitored daily for survival and weight loss. the clone contains a 25-nucleotide poly(A) stretch. the intermediate BAC and full-length JHMV cDNA were digested with PacI and SanDI restriction enzymes, ligated, and then transformed into DH10B E. coli cells. individual clones were screened by restriction endonuclease analysis with EcoRI and EcoRV. rJ virus engineered using pBAC-JHMV is infectious and replicates in similar manner to other recombinant JHMVs. pBAC-JHMV DNA was transfected into DBT cells along with a plasmid expressing N protein. plaques were observed 48 to 72 h after transfection. rJIA (B) and rJSD (C) viruses were analyzed for in vitro replication on 17Cl-1 cells. the recovered viruses were then analyzed for their ability to replicate in tissue culture cells and their ability to cause lethal encephalitis in mice. wild-type B6 mice were infected with 4E4 PFU rJIA (A and C) and 8E3 PFU rJSD (B and D) intranasally. rJIA and rJSD controls refer to viruses constructed using targeted recombination and in vitro ligation. rJ virus mutated at residue 1347 (N1347A) is minimally attenuated in vitro. pBAC-JHMV encoding the mutant was created using a two-step linear recombination with a Kanr-I-SceI dual marker cassette. 17Cl-1 cells were coinfected with N1347A (GFP+) and wild-type (GFP+) virus or wild-type (GFP+) and wild-type (GFP) virus at a ratio of 4:1 and at a combined MOI of 0.1 PFU/ml. the percentage of GFP-expressing virus was determined by dividing the number of GFP+ plaques by the number of total plaques. the wild-type sequence was reintroduced back into the mutant BAC clone using the same procedure, recreating a wild-type revertant BAC (pBAC-JHMVIA-GFPrevN1347) the virus will be termed WT (GFP), WT (GFP+) for the virus expressing GFP, N1347A, and revN1347. there was approximately 2-fold more viral gRNA in revN1347-infected cells than in N1347A-infected cells. a competition assay was performed in which 17Cl-1 cells were coinfected with N1347A (GFP+) and WT (GFP) virus at a total MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell to largely prevent dual infection of cells. rJ macrodomain is essential for virus-induced encephalitis in wild-type mice. we infected mice intranasally with approximately 4 104 PFU of revN1347 or N1347A virus. the mutant caused no weight loss or lethality, in stark contrast to revN1347 virus. mice infected intracranially and monitored for survival and weight loss for 14 days (n = 3 mice per group) brains were harvested at the indicated times and analyzed for viral loads as described for panel C. replication correlated with an altered innate immune response. we measured the levels of several proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine mRNAs in the brain by RT-qPCR. the RNA expression of CCL2, beta interferon (IFN-), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and TNF- were all reduced 2- to 4-fold at 5 days p.i. following infection with N1347A virus. revN1347-infected mice showed increased perivascular infiltrates, cellular debris, and apoptotic cells, consistent with brain disease typically induced by JHMV. however, N1347A induces lower levels of proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene expression than revN1347. total brain RNA was collected at 5 days p.i. cell populations refer to the CD45+ population (n = 5 for each group) results are representative of two independent experiments. revN1347 virus caused similarly lethal infections in TNF/ and B6 mice. but, remarkably, TNF/ mice succumbed to infection without losing weight. TNF signaling does not contribute to its attenuation. analyzed for infectious virus at 20 hpi by plaque assay. increased mortality in mice lacking T and B cells. a potent antiviral T cell response is required for coronavirus clearance. coronaviruses and viruses in the alpha-like supergroup of positive-strand RNA viruses contain a highly conserved macrodomain. but the role, function, and purpose of this domain in the context of viral replication and pathogenesis have remained enigmatic. previous studies have found that this domain is nonessential for replication in vitro but may be important for in vivo pathogenesis (9, 17, 18) several studies have shown that IFNAR/ mice succumb to infection with virulent and attenuated strains of MHV (44) (39), suggesting that N1347A is highly attenuated. in contrast, RAG1/ mice infected with the attenuated J2.2-V-1 strain of MHV remain asymptomatic for several weeks before succumbing to the infection (43), while SCID mice can survive for several months if treated with small amounts of anti-spike protein phenotypes in these reports are due to the loss of enzymatic activity of the macrodomain (15, 16). phenotypes in these reports are due to the loss of enzymatic activity of the macrodomain. coronavirus macrodomains also contain the ability to deMARylate proteins. be important to determine whether macrodomains also contain the ability to deMARylate proteins."}
