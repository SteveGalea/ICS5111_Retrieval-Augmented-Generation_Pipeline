{"summary": "URTIs and LRTIs represent the leading cause of death in children younger than five years of age worldwide. despite the viral aetiological origin of most respiratory infections, antibiotics are often prescribed in treatment of such diseases [8], exacerbating antibiotic abuse. human coronaviruses cause a plethora of diseases in animals. four human coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1) are endemic in the human population. another two human coronaviruses cause severe respiratory syndromes. morphologies similar to several other animal viruses previously identified. these viruses were later classified as coronaviruses, which was accepted as a new genus in 1975. many of the clinical samples collected and stored in the 1960s, which were positive for coronavirus-like particles, were lost. the outbreak of SARS-CoV was most-likely linked to a zoonotic event in the live animal markets of china. civets and raccoon dogs were the first animals identified to carry a SARS-like-CoV with 99.8% nucleotide homology to human SARS-CoV. infection results in haemorrhagic inflammation in most pulmonary alveoli with alveolar thickening, diffuse alveolar damage, desquamation of pneumocytes, formation of hyaline membranes and multinucleated pneumocytes with capillary engorgement. a surprising finding with the outbreak was that it was not as great a threat to infants and children. a 7 month old child presenting with bronchiolitis and conjunctivitis was screened for several respiratory viruses to identify the causative agent. the group then used a modified cDNA amplified restriction fragment-length polymorphism technique (Virus-Discovery-cDNA-AFLP or VIDISCA) technique. results showed highest sequence similarities with known coronaviruses. HCoV-NH was identified by PCR which was adapted to amplify a conserved region within the replicase 1a or pol gene. molecular clock analyses have shown that HCoV-NL63 diverged from a most recent common ancestor, in a zoonotic event, approximately 563 to 822 years ago. recombination has given HCoV-NL63 a mosaic structured genome with multiple recombination sites a sputum sample was collected from a 60 year old patient presenting with severe respiratory disease in the Dr. Soliman Fakeeh Hospital in jeddah, Saudi Arabia. the virus was identified as a novel coronavirus, provisionally termed HCoV-EMC (human coronavirus Erasmus Medical College) the patient succumbed to the disease with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure [60] primary infections, to which all cases were linked directly or indirectly, occurred in Middle Eastern countries including Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, Oman and United Arab Emirates. the potential of widespread pandemic outbreak is thought to be low as human-to-human transmission is largely inefficient [64] and only reported in close, sustained contact [65] such as within families [66], healthcare workers [67] and as nosocomial transmission [68] there has been no evidence to suggest sustained community transmission. the potential of widespread pandemic outbreak is thought to be low. the spread between infected patients strongly suggests zoonotic transmission. the identification of the wet markets of china as probable source greatly contributed to the control of the disease. a patient who succumbed to MERS-CoV infection obtained the virus directly from his camel herd. the direction of transmission was confirmed as camel-to-human by serological analysis. this is strongly linked to an increasingly popular hypothesis that MERS-CoV infections in humans are directly acquired from camels. SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV present with severe respiratory complications and often multisystem involvement with enteric symptoms. the high fatality rates associated with these infections is not reflected in the remaining four human coronaviruses. study reveals 50% of patients infected with HCoV-HKU1 experience febrile seizures. report on prevalence of human coronaviruses and their association with upper and lower respiratory tract disease vary but range between 3.3% and 16%. human coronaviruses Frequently Present with Co-Infection High rates of co-infection with other respiratory viruses are commonly reported [85,86,95,99] no significant difference in disease progression in co-infected versus mono-infected patients has been reported. role in facilitation of infection of one respiratory virus by another is still speculative. prevalence, regional distribution and pathogenicity of individual human coronaviruses is unclear. the outbreak of SARS-CoV was most-likely linked to a zoonotic event in the live animal markets of china. the outbreak of SARS-CoV was most-likely linked to a zoonotic event in the live animal markets of china. 40% of wild animal traders and 20% of people responsible for the slaughtering of animals in the region where human SARS was thought to originate were seropositive for SARS-CoV. this indicates that these people were previously exposed to a SARS-like-CoV, which resulted in asymptomatic infection [38]. human Coronavirus NL63 and HKU1: Discovery of Existing Coronaviruses 2.2.1. cDNA amplified restriction fragment-length polymorphism (cDNA-AFLP) technique. results showed highest sequence similarities with known coronaviruses. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E diverged from a most recent common ancestor, in a zoonotic event, approximately 563 to 822 years ago. recombination of the two lineages has given HCoV-NL63 a mosaic structured genome with multiple recombination sites. the human coronavirus was later isolated from another female patient. successful propagation of the virus was achieved recently in human ciliated airway epithelial cells. the presence of the HE gene further characterizes HCoV-HKU1. novel coronavirus was retrospectively isolated from a nose swab sample. it was reported to be similar to HCoV-NL63 and named HCoV-NL. in 2005, Esper et al. (2005) also reported the identification of a novel coronavirus. a pan-coronavirus RT-PCR targeting a conserved region of the pol gene confirmed the presence of a coronavirus but attempts to culture the causative agent were unsuccessful. the human coronavirus, termed HCoV-HKU1, was later isolated from another female patient. the virus was identified as a novel coronavirus, provisionally called HCoV-EMC (human coronavirus Erasmus Medical College) the patient succumbed to the disease with acute pneumonia and subsequent renal failure [60]. a retrospective study further traced the virus back to April 2012 where an outbreak of pneumonia, resulting in two fatalities, occurred in health care workers in an intensive care unit in Zarqa, Jordan [61]. a total of 699 laboratory confirmed cases with a total of 209 fatalities [70] within a 4 month period case numbers had more than trebled suggesting the virus is far from controlled. the fatality rate of 30% is also substantially increased in patients with comorbidities. a large number of reported cases are identified in immunocompromised patients or those with underlying disease. high sequence homology between bat-CoV HKU4 and HKU5 in china. high levels of neutralizing antibodies, viral RNA and infectious viruses have been discovered in dromedary camels suggesting a potential for camels to form the source for human transmission. a patient who succumbed to MERS-CoV infection obtained the virus directly from his camel herd. the likelihood of recombination leading to future outbreaks is high. the threat of potential pandemics is real as highly pathogenic coronaviruses spill over from zoonotic sources into the human population. majority of infections are associated with self-limiting upper respiratory tract disease or \u201cthe common cold\u201d but can also present with high morbidity outcomes of the lower respiratory tract including bronchiolitis, pneumonia, [87,88,89], asthmatic exacerbations [9] acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and croup in HCoV-NL63 infected patients. coronaviruses frequently associated with co-infection include enterovirus, rhinovirus and PIV [100] however reports of co-infection with two human coronaviruses are limited. clinical progression and outcomes of disease in patients presenting with co-infection are however similar to patients presenting with mono-infection [85,95]. clinical presentation of human coronaviruses is largely identical and indistinguishable symptomatically, commonly presenting with rhinorrhoea, sore throat, cough and fever [85,86] majority of infections are associated with self-limiting upper respiratory tract disease or \u201cthe common cold\u201d but can also present with high morbidity outcomes of the lower respiratory tract. coronaviruses frequently associated with co-infection include enterovirus, rhinovirus and PIV [100] however reports of co-infection with two human coronaviruses are limited. clinical progression and outcomes of disease in patients presenting with co-infection are however similar to patients presenting with mono-infection. a previously undiscovered virus was identified in 28 epidemiologically distinct patients in the Netherlands. symptoms were similar to those infected with RSV. cytopathic effects caused by the virus were largely identical to those caused by RSV. hMPV infection in the young and elderly frequently requires hospitalization. fatalities have been reported in the elderly [110,111] an increased morbidity in elderly patients with a delayed clearance of symptoms has been reported. asymptomatic infections or cold- and flu-like symptoms are most prevalent presentation. hMPV was only discovered in 2001, but it has been shown by phylogenetic analysis to have been in existence for approximately 50 years. two lineages, A and B, were further subdivided into two sublineages per lineage, A1-A2 and B1-B2 [16]. a recent report analyzing sequence divergence indicates the presence of five sublineages, namely A1, A2a, A2b, B1 and B2 [122]. hMPV infections are more likely to present with pneumonia or asthma. the most common presentation of hMPV in children includes complications of the upper respiratory tract with rhinorrhoea, cough and fever [105], conjunctivitis, rash, diarrhea and vomiting are reported. coinfections with hMPV are strongly affected by bacterial coinfections with pneumococcus. asymptomatic infections or cold- and flu-like symptoms are the most prevalent presentation. asymptomatic infections or cold- and flu-like symptoms are the most prevalent presentation. hMPV was only discovered in 2001, it has been shown by phylogenetic analysis to have been in existence for approximately 50 years. phylogenetic analysis shows that two lineages, A and B, existed. these two lines were further subdivided into two sublineages per lineage, A1-A2 and B1-B2 [16]. hMPV has a worldwide distribution and affects all age groups. hMPV predominantly affects young, elderly and immunocompromised patients. seasonal prevalence in late winter and spring has been observed. HBoV1 infects human airway epithelium cells and leads to damage of airway epithelial cells. hBoV2\u20134 are found in the gastrointestinal tract and hBoV2\u20134 are associated with gastroenteritis. HBoV2 is the only enteric bocavirus to be isolated from nasopharygeal aspirates. hBoV1 is associated with pneumonia, wheezing, asthmatic exacerbations and bronchiolitis. there is no statistical evidence to associate hBoV1 with gastrointestinal disease. hBoV1 appears to be more than just a respiratory or gastrointestinal virus. hBoV1 is a respiratory pathogen affecting all regions of the globe. it infects human airway epithelium cells and leads to damage of airway epithelial cells. hBoV2 is the only enteric bocavirus to be isolated from nasopharygeal aspirates. hBoV1 infection is associated with pneumonia, wheezing, asthmatic exacerbations and bronchiolitis. hBoV1 has been isolated from stool samples, but there is no statistical evidence to associate hBoV1 with gastrointestinal disease. authors speculate that hBoV could contribute to the development of some lung and colorectal tumors. however, they acknowledge that these tumors could simply be providing an optimal environment for hBoV replication. techniques in the past decade have led to the discovery of four previously circulating respiratory viruses and the rapid characterization of two completely novel viruses. all these viruses have varying but significant impact on human health and the potential for outbreak of completely novel, emergent respiratory viruses poses their own unique threats."}
