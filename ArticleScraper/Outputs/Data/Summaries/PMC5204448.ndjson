{"summary": "in 2003, the world health organization (WHO) convened an informal consultation on characterization and quality aspects of vaccines based on live virus vectors. recombination of a live virus-vectored vaccine with a circulating or reactivated latent virus could theoretically generate a more pathogenic strain. the fda and the european medicines agency have published guidance for use of recombinant virus-vectored vaccines. the following report specifically explores the issue of potential recombination between virus-vectored vaccines and wild type pathogenic strains of virus. both vaccines are based on the live yellow fever vaccine virus vector. the genes for the yellow fever virus virion structural proteins M and E have been replaced with homologous genes from dengue virus or japanese encephalitis virus respectively. recombination has been observed in several single-stranded RNA virus families representing both positive and negative sense genomes. recombination in RNA viruses, including retroviruses, is thought to occur during replication via \u201ccopy choice\u201d. however, the circumstances leading to such a coinfection in vivo are not clearly understood. study describing interclade recombinants of varicella zoster virus. recombination between attenuated vaccines and wild type viruses has been documented. vaccinia virus used as vaccine during smallpox eradication campaign in brazil has established a durable reservoir in the wild. a strain of the poxvirus myxoma arose via homologous and non-homologous recombination between a wild myxoma strain and a vaccine strain. recombination between independently derived attenuated avian herpesvirus vaccine strains can give rise to pathogenic recombinant viruses. the retroviral disease reticuloendotheliosis was introduced into avian populations via contamination during development recombination has occurred between traditional live attenuated vaccine viruses and wild type virus strains. to date there are no examples of recombination between viral vaccine vectors and wild type virus strains outside of the laboratory. but on at least two separate occasions the possibility of recombination between viral vaccine vectors and wild type virus strains has been debated. a live virus-vectored vaccine is biologically active and produces virus progeny in the vaccinated host. a non-replicating virus-vectored vaccine is so severely attenuated that is cannot undergo a complete replication cycle in infected cells. only two virus-vectored vaccines have been approved for human use. encephalitis virus, dengue virus and yellow fever virus are all flaviviruses. chimeras represent relatively subtle exchanges of antigens among closely related viruses. a variety of viral-vectored vaccines are available for use in veterinary practice. recombination in RNA viruses, including retroviruses, is thought to occur during replication via \u201ccopy choice\u201d. recombination in RNA viruses, including retroviruses, is thought to occur during replication via \u201ccopy choice\u201d, namely switching RNA templates during replication with the result that the newly synthesized genome contains sequences from two different parental molecules. the smallpox eradication campaign in brazil has established a durable reservoir in the wild. the bovine herpesvirus vaccine may establish a latent reservoir in vaccinated animals which, through reactivation, may spread to other animals. recombination between wild, circulating strains of Newcastle disease virus (NDV), an avian paramyxovirus, and attenuated NDV vaccine strains. the retroviral disease reticuloendotheliosis was introduced into avian populations via contamination during development of fowlpox and herpesvirus vaccines. more than 100 million doses of poxvirus-vectored recombinant rabies virus vaccine has been distributed in the wild in the united states,. Eurasia and Western Europe resulting in reproducible reduction or elimination of wild rabies. recombination between viral vaccine vectors and wild type virus strains has been debated in the literature. one debate related to the development of chimeriVax based vaccines. one debate related to the development of Newcastle disease virus as a vector. circulating wild type virus and the consequences of such recombination can be identified and evaluated at least qualitatively during vaccine development. the major variables are: 1. Intrinsic recombination properties of the parent virus used as a vector. 2. Sequence relatedness of vector and wild virus. 3. Host range, pathogenesis and transmission. 4. Replication competency of vector in target host. 5. Additional factors potentially affecting virulence. 7. Circulation of multiple recombin the intrinsic rates of recombination in cell culture and in laboratory animals can often be determined experimentally. the recombination properties of any given virus should be taken into account during vaccine vector development. the majority of observed recombination events occur through regions of nucleic acid sequence homology between parental genomes. a relatively low frequency, and manipulations to influence homologous recombination will theoretically not affect non-homologous recombination events. recombination between two viruses should be directly proportional to the probability that a cell will be co-infected by the two parental viruses under consideration. transmission mechanism could also theoretically affect the probability of recombination between a viral vaccine vector and a circulating virus. different species of arthropod-borne flaviviruses exhibit differences in observable recombination frequencies in nature attributable to differences in mechanism of vectoring by ticks and mosquitoes. the probability of recombination between a viral vaccine vector and a wild virus should be proportional to the virus load in a vaccinated individual. mechanism of attenuation impacts consequences of recombination between a vaccine vector and a wild type virus. recombination with a wild orthopox virus (cowpox virus, vaccinia virus or monkeypox virus) could either \u201crepair\u201d some virulence mutations or transfer the transgene into a wild type virus background, generating a recombinant with improved replication properties relative to the original vaccine vector. recombination of a vector expressing such a virulence factor with a wild type virus could result in production of a wild virus with increased virulence. attenuated vaccinia Tiantan [65], [66] used in china for smallpox eradication is being assessed as a replication-competent vector for both HIV-1 and H5N1 [68] vaccines. s for infectious laryngotracheitis virus, a herpesvirus affecting commercial poultry, cited above under \"vaccine viruses in the wild\" recombination properties of the parental viruses are associated with different intrinsic frequencies of recombination, and these intrinsic properties will affect the probability that recombination will take place. recombination among negative stranded RNA viruses can be demonstrated on an evolutionary scale. sequence alterations to a vector that reduce homology with the wild type virus should theoretically reduce probability of recombination between vector and wild type virus. vectors engineered in this fashion should theoretically have a reduced frequency of recombination with wild type homologs. non-homologous recombination among viruses does occur, though at a relatively low frequency. the probability of co-infection may theoretically be influenced by virus host range, pathogenesis and transmission. avian Newcastle disease virus (NDV) as a vector in humans would present minimal opportunity for co-infection with wild type avian virus, thus limiting the opportunity for recombination. vectors are either defective for virus replication or artificially attenuated for pathogenicity in their target populations. attenuation sometimes equates to reduced virus replication, hence reduced virus load and reduced opportunity for recombination. adenovirus vector artificially attenuated by deletion of the essential viral E1 regulatory region. if attenuation is genetically linked to transgene expression, reversion to virulence seems unlikely. in an adenovirus vector the transgene encoding an immunizing antigen may be inserted into a deleted region [62] so that any recombination event that restores virulence to the vector also deletes the transgene and conversely transfer of the transgene to a wild type virus also transfers attenuation. attenuated vaccinia Tiantan used in china for smallpox eradication is being assessed as a replication-competent vector for both HIV-1 and H5N1 [68] vaccines. replication-competent adenovirus serotype 4 (Ad4) has been tested in humans as a vector for H5N1 [70] HIV and anthrax. ChimeriVax is a live, attenuated recombinant virus platform constructed from the live attenuated yellow fever (YF) vaccine strain 17D. the envelope protein genes of YF 17D are replaced with the corresponding genes of another flavivirus. concerns have been raised that recombination between chimeriVax vectored vaccines and wild type flaviviruses could generate a novel virus with enhanced pathogenicity [47], [48 the Brighton Collaboration recommends developers take responsibility for assessing the potential for recombination between their virus-vectored vaccine and wild-type circulating viruses. consider the possibility that a recombination event with a wild virus could lead to a virus of increased pathogenicity. consider vector designs that could further reduce probability of a recombination event, and enhance safety, while leaving the potency of the vector largely intact. individual members of the Working Group do not necessarily represent the official positions of each participant's organization. they should not be construed to represent any Agency determination or policy."}
