{"summary": "HA1 is proteolytically cleaved into two subunits, HA1 and HA2, which primes the protein for membrane fusion (3\u20135) during viral replication, HA1 binds to sialic acid receptors on the host cell plasma membrane, which triggers its uptake into the cell by clathrin-mediated endocytosis. the timing of genome release impacts downstream steps in viral replication. HA from highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus activates at between pH 5.3 and 5.9 (12\u201314), while HA from human seasonal viruses undergoes fusion closer to pH 5.0 (15). HA mutation in circulating pandemic H1N1 (pH1N1) has a reduced pH of fusion from 5.4 to 5. this indicates that circulating strains of pH1N1 could be becoming more acid stable. fusion is induced by incubating the HA-expressing cells in a low-pH environment. syncytia are formed through the action of HA expressed in the cell plasma membranes. in this environment, HA may respond differently to acidification relative to HA in the native viral membrane envelope. virions can be exposed to low pH, causing HA to undergo a conformational change. this is followed by protease exposure to partially digest the HA. the structure is then imaged by electron microscopy (EM) single-particle-tracking (SPT) techniques capture several steps of the viral entry process in a single assay. virions fusing to an SLB within an evanescent field of 100 to 200 nm in depth. SPT approaches have unveiled new information about the fusion mechanism of influenza virus (33, 34), vesicular stomatitis virus (35), Sindbis virus (36), and coronaviruses (37). fusion rates and HA inactivation as they vary with pH more completely characterizes the acid stability and functionality of the HA protein. lipids used in experiments were 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), 1-oleoyl-2-palmitoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (POPC), cholesterol, and total ganglioside extract (tGE) lipids were obtained from Avanti Polar Lipids (Alabaster, AL) polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS; Sylgard 184), used to fabricate microfluidic flow cell devices, were purchased from VWR. Sodium chloride salt (NaCl) and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (MES), used to make buffers, were purchased from VWR. triethylamine used to stop the reaction was purchased from Acros Organics. allantoic fluid was collected from the eggs in 50-ml Falcon tubes. the supernatant was ultracentrifuged in a Ti45 rotor at 35,000 rpm. pellets containing virus were resuspended in approximately 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) per 60-ml ultracentrifuge tube. DMEM-trypsin solution was comprised of 2% sea plaque agarose in water and 2 DMEM containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) at pH 7.4 and 4\u00b0C. the cells were then stained with crystal violet to determine the titer of each virus. 7.5 g of 1-octadecanol and 30 mg of rhodamine 110 chloride were mixed together at 80\u00b0C. the reaction was run for 48 h at 80\u00b0C and halted by the addition of 600 l of triethylamine. a chromatography column was prepared so that there was a 1-cm-high silica slurry at the bottom with a 10-cm-high alumina slurry above. to form liposomes, appropriate amounts of each component were mixed in biotechnology-grade chloroform in a scintillation vial. the bulk solvent was removed from the vial under a stream of high-purity nitrogen gas and then placed into a desiccator under a vacuum overnight. the final lipid concentration was approximately 2 mg/ml. microfluidic devices for fusion experiments were fabricated by using soft lithography. both the clean glass coverslip and microfluidic device mold were treated with oxygen plasma by using a Harrick plasma cleaner. liposomes of the same composition used in experiments were prepared with 0.1 mol% Texas Red DHPE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) liposomes were allowed to incubate for 10 min in each solution, before being rinsed with buffer A for 1 min. the bilayer was scratched with a dissection tool to remove a thin line of bilayer to aid in focusing on the plane of the bilayer on the microscope. two lasers can be used simultaneously to excite different-colored fluorophores. they were coupled into the optical pathway of the microscope by using a laser TIRF 3 slider (Carl Zeiss, Inc.), which controlled the angles of incidence. the evanescent waves excited fluorescently labeled virus bound to sialic acid groups. a green-emitting fluorophore (R110C18) was added to samples of 5 l of X:31, 20 l of Brisbane, and 20 l of Udorn. the sample was allowed to incubate for 16 to 20 h with gentle agitation. 3.5 l of buffer A was added to the supernatant collected from each column. influenza virus A/Aichi/1968/H3N2 (X:31) was purchased from Charles River Labs. A/Udorn/1972/H3N2 and A/Brisbane/2007/H3N2 were obtained from bei Resources. the fluorescently labeld lipid Oregon green 488 DHPE was used to conduct fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Sodium chloride salt (NaCl) and 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid sodium salt (MES) were purchased from VWR. rhodamine 110 chloride and 1-octadecanol were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. allantoic fluid was collected from the eggs in 50-ml Falcon tubes. pellets containing virus were resuspended in approximately 2 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) per 60-ml ultracentrifuge tube. the viral titers were determined to be 5 109 PFU/ml, 2.3 108 PFU/ml, and 1.8 107 PFU/ml for X:31, Udorn, and Brisbane respectively. monolayers of vero E6 cells were grown in 24-well plates and infected with influenza virus at a multiplicity of 5. the reaction mixture was cooled to room temperature, dissolved in 200 ml of diethyl ether, and then filtered. a chromatography column was prepared so that there was a 1-cm-high silica slurry at the bottom with a 10-cm-high alumina slurry above. the product was loaded onto the column and eluted with 100 ml each of 10%, 20%, 30%, and 40% isopropanol in chloroform the bulk solvent was removed from the vial under a stream of high-purity nitrogen gas and then placed into a desiccator overnight. the film was gently resuspended in a sonication bath (model no. BD2500A-DTH; VWR) for 20 min on the \u201clow\u201d-power setting. supported lipid bilayers were formed in the flow cell via vesicle fusion (39\u201341) by drawing a 10% dilution of liposomes into each channel at a flow rate of 100 l/min for 1 min. after 1 min, the flow rate was reduced to 10 l/min for 10 more minutes and then stopped to allow the channel to incubate for an additional 10 min. liposomes were allowed to incubate for 10 min in each solution, before being rinsed with buffer A for 1 min. a 20-m-diameter spot in the supported lipid bilayer was bleached with a 4.7-mW, 561-nm krypton-argon laser for 1,000 ms. iss, Inc. controlled the angles of incidence. excitation laser light was band-pass filtered through a semrock 74 HE green fluorescent protein (GFP)/mRFP filter cube. the excitation laser light was then combined with a dichroic mirror. two hundred microliters of buffer A was added to each sample. the sample was allowed to incubate for 16 to 20 h with gentle agitation. the mixture was then filtered through a G-25 spin column. ganglioside extract (TGE) were formed on the walls of the microfluidic device. hemifusion begins when HA undergoes a conformational change due to acidic stimuli. the viral membrane is labeled with a self-quenching green dye. the hemifusion lag time, defined as the time that elapsed between acidification and the appearance of the hemifusion spike, was determined for each individual fusion event over multiple experiments. the cumulative distribution curves were then fit with a gamma distribution function to determine the kinetic rate constants and parameters for each initiating pH value. pH is the probability of hemifusion, kH is the hemifusion rate constant, t is the hemifusion lag time, and N is a fit parameter that describes the number of steps in the fusion pathway. the gamma distribution was best fit to our data by using nonlinear least-squares fitting. X:31 and Udorn require 3 cooperating proteins over most of the physiological pH range. Brisbane matches N at high pH but then exhibits a downward trend in N as the pH drops until leveling off in the range of N values of 1 to 2. the most clinically relevant strain, Brisbane, has a dependence on pH that is markedly different from those of the laboratory-adapted strains. the first fusion activity was observed at pH 5.5; however, from this point on, its value is almost five times lower than those of X:31 and Udorn at their maximum fusion pHs. the rates of transition from hemifusion to pore formation (kpore) were determined to be 0.08 s1, 0.39 s1 and 0.23 s1 for X:31, Udorn, and Brisbane respectively. if the transition from hemifusion to pore formation is a one-step rate process, then the gamma distribution will reduce to a simple single exponential decay. the number of particles that achieve these conditions is low in any given experiment. pore formation events were measured over 3 experiments for X:31, Udorn, and 33 events for Brisbane. virions used here were spherical. TEM of both Udorn and X:31 showed that neither strain contained any filaments (Fig. 4B and C) differences in fusion kinetics observed here are not due to differences in virion morphology among these strains. X:31 and udorn fusion events occur until 150 s postacidification. at pH 4.5, all fusion activity ceased after 40 s. the same overall trend in deactivation was observed for X:31. pH sensitivity of HA is determined by using cell-cell fusion (syncytium formation) or virus-liposome fusion assays. serotypes that mediate fusion at lower pHs are deemed to be more acid stable than serotypes which undergo fusion at higher pHs. the pH sensitivity of X:31 is in good agreement with data reported previously by Galloway et al. the first syncytia were observed at pH 5.3, 5.7, and 5.5 for X:31, Udorn, and Brisbane respectively. the pHs at which fusion first occurs for X:31, Udorn, and Brisbane are 5.3, 5.7, and 5.5. an evanescent wave is created at the SLB, resulting in a region 100 to 200 nm in depth, where individual virions bound to the SLB can be observed. virions are labeled by using a 2-color dye approach to distinguish hemifusion from pore formation. a series of TIRFM images depicting hemifusion events for X:31, Udorn, and Brisbane at pH 4.5. the hemifusion lag time, defined as the time that elapsed between acidification and the appearance of the hemifusion spike, was determined for each individual fusion event over multiple experiments. the rate constants were determined to be 0.04 s1, 0.06 s1 and 0.13 s1 for X:31 (52 events), Brisbane (221 events), and Udorn (90 events), respectively. kH is the hemifusion rate constant, t is the hemifusion lag time, and N is a fit parameter that describes the number of steps in the fusion pathway. fusion activity for X:31 is first observed at initiation pH 5.3. at mildly acidic initiation pHs, the rate of hemifusion is low but jumps to a rate about four times higher at pH 4.7. the rate of fusion of X:31 is first observed at initiation pH 5.3. the most clinically relevant strain, Brisbane, has a dependence on pH that is markedly different from those of the laboratory-adapted strains. it is expected that the release of the Brisbane genome would occur at a lower rate but over a broader pH range, resulting in a significantly acidic environment (late endosome) before the genome is released. the rate constant for transition from hemifusion to pore formation was determined by measuring the elapsed time between the dequenching of R110C18 in the viral membrane and the loss of the SRB signal in the viral interior. these data were then plotted as a cumulative distribution and fitted with a gamma distribution to determine kpore for each strain of virus. virions are active or fusion competent, according to the highest fusion extents. the number of particles that achieve these conditions is low in any given experiment. pore formation events were measured over 3 experiments for X:31, Udorn, and 33 for Brisbane. X:31 and X:31 had monodisperse populations with average hydrodynamic diameters of 178 nm and 157 nm respectively. however, the peak at 712 nm is most likely aggregated virus. transmission electron micrographs did not reveal any filaments to be present in the sample. X:31 and udorn fusion events occur until 150 s postacidification. at pH 4.5, all fusion activity ceased after 40 s. the trend for Brisbane fusion was markedly different from that of both laboratory-adapted strains. in each cumulative distribution curve are 52, 102, 109, 106, and 135 events at pH 5.3, 5.1, 4.9, and 4.7, respectively, for X:31 (A); 125, 245, 221, 142, 88, and 151 events at pH 5.7, 5.5, 5.3, 5.3, 5.1, 4.7, and 4.5, respectively, for udorn (B); and 52, 90, 66, 77, and 145 events syncytium formation in vero E6 cells 6 h after infection with influenza virus. cells were exposed to increasingly acidic buffer until syncytia were observed. formation of syncytium at pH 5.1 is also shown for reference. X:31 and Udorn have been passaged in eggs three times at most. X:31 is the most acid stable, requiring the lowest pH to see any fusion activity. however, single-particle analysis of each strain's fusion trend revealed that the kinetics of Brisbane fusion are essentially independent of pH. Syncytium assays are a standard measurement for determining the stability of a given HA protein under acidic conditions. the first pH at which syncytia are formed does not necessarily correlate with the exact pH at which the rate of fusion is maximized inside the endosome. the extents of fusion for each strain at each initiating pH can be obtained by tracking virions that fuse and those that do not. the timing of vRNA release is crucial for successful infection. the timing of vRNA release is crucial for successful infection. these H3 strains exhibit very different fusion characteristics and behaviors. they may hold some clue for eventually understanding host tropism."}
