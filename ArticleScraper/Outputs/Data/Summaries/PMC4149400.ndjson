{"summary": "study describes the epidemiology of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia. the frequency of cases and deaths was calculated and adjusted by month, sex, age group, and region. the highest number of cases and deaths occurred between April and may 2014. the geographic distribution of cases has been mainly confined to six countries in the Arabian Peninsula (Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Kuwait, Jordan, and Oman) instances of the disease have been detected in some countries in Europe and Africa. resulting deaths were calculated and categorized by date of diagnosis, sex, age group, and region. average relative humidity and temperature of the regions with the highest incidence of MERS-CoV in Saudi Arabia were calculated, to study the geographical and temporal characteristics of this disease. there were 260 cases (62%) among the male population and 162 cases (38%) among the female population. the number of deaths was higher among men (89 deaths [74%] than among women (31 deaths [26%]) and the case fatality rate was higher among men (52%) than women (23%). the frequency of MERS-CoV cases and deaths, adjusted by region, in Saudi Arabia. the highest number of cases and deaths occurred in Riyadh (169 cases; 43 deaths), followed by Jeddah (156 cases; 36 deaths) and the Eastern Region (24 cases; 22 deaths). however, the highest case fatality rate was recorded in the Eastern Region (92%), followed by Medinah (36%) and Najran (33%). in jeddah, the average temperature ranged from 15\u00b0C\u201337\u00b0C in April and May 2014, the period with the highest rate of cases and deaths. in jeddah, the average relative humidity was the lowest recoded for the year, at 30%\u201335%. the average temperature in the Eastern Region ranged from 17\u00b0C\u201337\u00b0C in April and May 2014. the lowest average relative humidity for the year (18%\u201330%) was recorded at this time. in Medinah, the average relative humidity was between 8%\u201320%. the highest rates of MERS-CoV cases and deaths were not observed in winter, but in mid-Spring, between April and May. a recent study suggests that there is also a higher incidence of influenza in men than in women, which is due to a higher level of testosterone and a corresponding suppression of their immune response. MERS-CoV incidence rates are higher in environments with low relative humidity (20%) and high temperatures (20\u00b0C\u201335\u00b0C) therefore, increasing relative humidity to above 35% may decrease the activity of influenza virus particles to 14%. a relative humidity of 23% or less may increase the activity of influenza virus particles from 70%\u201377%."}
