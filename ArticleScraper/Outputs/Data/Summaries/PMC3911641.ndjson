{"summary": "a new coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), emerged during the summer of 2012 in Saudi Arabia. as of 22 October 2013, a total of 139 confirmed cases were reported, with a 43% mortality rate. zoonotic coronaviruses frequently cross species barriers to infect humans. the genes 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b encode group-specific proteins (13) in the case of SARS-CoV, the genes 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b, and 9b encode group-specific proteins. ion conductance and selectivity of this ion channel are influenced by the lipid charge of the membranes (15, 16) reduced survival in SARS is associated with male gender, age over 60 years, neutrophilia, and severe biochemical abnormalities. the model that best fits human SARS is infection of conventional mice with mouse-adapted SARS-CoVs (31\u201333) NF-B inhibitors caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE), resveratrol, bay11-7082, and parthenolide were purchased from Tocris Biosciences, Sigma, Calbiochem, and Enzo Life Sciences. the mouse-adapted MA15 viruses (32), recombinant SARS-CoV-MA15 (rSARS-CoV-MA15) and rSARS-CoV-MA15-E were rescued infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (animal transport unit-biocontainment unit [ATU-BCU], Allentown, Inc., Allentown, NJ) mice were infected as described above with 6,000 or 100,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15 or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E virus, respectively, in 50 l of DMEM. eight-week-old or 16-week-old mice were infected with 6,000 or 100,000 PFU of virus. cells were prepared as previously described (45) for routine histology, sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. lungs were thawed and homogenized in RNA Later (Ambion) for 24 h. total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) cDNA was prepared using a high-capacity cDNA transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) followed by PCR using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) specific for murine genes. nuclear, cytoplasmic, and extracellular proteins were extracted using a nuclear extract kit (Active Motif, Carlsbad, CA) supernatant proteins (cytoplasmic and extracellular proteins) were diluted 1:4 in assay diluent (Millipore) before analysis. plasmid p55UASGluc encoding the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the GAL4 upstream activation sequence (UAS) plasmid pGAL4DBD-IRF3 or pGAL4DBD-IRF7, encoding the IRF3 or IRF7 transactivation domains fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD) mice were infected intranasally with 100,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15 or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E virus. lungs were removed from mice at 2 and 4 dpi and homogenized. nuclear extracts from infected cells and homogenized lungs were obtained using a nuclear extraction kit. DBT-mACE2 cells were infected at an MOI of 0.05 with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E or rSARS-CoV-MA15. at 43 hpi, half of the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium containing CAPE (50 g/ml), resveratrol (40 g/ml), bay11-7082 (40 M), or parthenolide (24 M). at 48 hpi, mice containing 100 UI/ml penicillin, 0.1 mg/ml streptomycin, 50 g/ml gentamicin and 0.5 g/ml amphotericin B (Fungizone) were rescued from infectious cDNA clones. all work with infectious viruses and infected animals was performed in biosafety level 3 (BSL3) facilities by personnel wearing positive-pressure air-purifying respirators. infected mice were housed in a ventilated rack (animal transport unit-biocontainment unit [ATU-BCU], Allentown, NJ) mice were infected as described above with 6,000 or 100,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15 or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E virus, respectively, in 50 l of DMEM. eight-week-old or 16-week-old mice were lightly anesthetized with is eight-week-old or 16-week-old mice were infected with 6,000 or 100,000 PFU of virus. cells were prepared as previously described (45) for surface staining, 106 cells were blocked with 1 g of anti-CD16/32 antibody and 1% rat serum. lungs were thawed and homogenized in RLT buffer (Qiagen) using gentleMACS Dissociator. total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) cDNA was prepared using a high-capacity cDNA transcription kit (Applied Biosystems) followed by PCR using TaqMan gene expression assays (Applied Biosystems) specific for murine genes. supernatant proteins (cytoplasmic and extracellular proteins) were diluted 1:4 in assay diluent. expression of CCL2/MCP-1, and CXCL10/IP-10 was measured. plasmids encoding the firefly luciferase ORF were cotransfected as negative controls. plasmid p55UASGluc encoding the firefly luciferase gene under the control of the GAL4 upstream activation sequence (UAS) plasmid pGAL4DBD-IRF3 or pGAL4DBD-IRF7, encoding the IRF3 or IRF7 transactivation domains fused to the GAL4 DNA binding domain (DBD), provided by T. Fujita (Kyoto University, rSARS-CoV-MA15 or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E virus in 50 l of DMEM or treated with DMEM alone. NF-B DNA-binding activity in infected cells was measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and a chemiluminescent kit. at 43 hpi, half of the culture medium was removed and replaced with medium containing CAPE (50 g/ml), resveratrol (40 g/ml), bay11-7082 (40 M), or parthenolide (24 M) at 48 hpi, supernatants were collected, and total cellular RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Minikit (Qiagen) rSARS-CoV-MA15-E is attenuated in young (6 weeks) and aged (12 and 18 months old) mice. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E is attenuated in young (6 weeks) and aged (12 and 18 months old) mice. the total number of leukocytes, macrophages, and neutrophils was reduced in mice infected with either dose of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. the percentage of lung neutrophils was also decreased in rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected mice. these results indicated that the presence of E protein led to a specific increase in neutrophil influx. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E grew to lower titers in mice. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E and rSARS-CoV-MA15 replicated less robustly in mice. weight loss and survival were evaluated daily. rSARS-CoV-MA15-infected mice started to lose weight at day 2 p.i. 80% of the mice died by day 6. RNA and protein were extracted from lung samples at days 2 and 4 p.i. to measure proinflammatory cytokine mRNA levels. sixteen-week-old mice were infected with 100,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E or rSARS-CoV-MA15. weight loss and survival were evaluated daily in mice infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E (E) or rSARS-CoV-MA15 (wt) (10 mice per group) number indicates levels of gene expression in rSARS-CoV-MA15-E- or rS rSARS-CoV-MA15-E and rSARS-CoV-MA15-E were infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E and rSARS-CoV-MA15 at MOIs of 0.5 and 0.05. the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines CCL2, CXCL1 and CXCL2 was evaluated by RT-qPCR at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E and rSARS-CoV-MA15-E cells were infected at MOIs of 0.5 and 0.05 with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E and rSARS-CoV-MA15 (wt) cellular RNAs were extracted at 24, 48, and 72 hpi. expression of indicated cytokines was determined by RT-qPCR. firefly luciferase levels were measured at 48 h postinfection. levels were normalized to those of Renilla luciferase. transcription factors IRF3 and NF-B were activated in rSARS-CoV-MA15-infected cells compared to levels in mock-infected cells. cells were infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E or rSARS-CoV-MA15 (wt) at an MOI of 0.05 at 24 h posttransfection. levels of firefly luciferase expression were quantified 48 h later. levels of firefly luciferase expression were normalized to that of Renilla luciferase. MA15-infected lungs compared to mock-infected ones at day 2 p.i. levels up to 3.1-fold higher in rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected lungs. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected mice were infected with 100,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15. four NF-B inhibitors were used to minimize the likelihood of off-target effects. NF-B activity decreased in both mock- and rSARS-CoV-MA15-infected cells treated with the four NF-B inhibitors compared to activity in nontreated cells. none of these inhibitors affected virus titers. NF-B activation was analyzed in cells transfected with luciferase plasmids. expression levels of different genes were normalized to expression of nontreated, mock-infected cells. rSARS-CoV-MA15- and mock-infected mice treated with inhibitors showed no signs of clinical disease or weight loss and no mortality. animals were monitored daily for mortality. data are representative of three independent experiments. differences in survival between nontreated mice and mice treated with NF-B inhibitors were statistically significant. NF-B inhibitors also reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and lung pathology in vivo. these results indicated that NF-B inhibitors also reduced the expression of proinflammatory cytokines in vivo. pulmonary pathology associated with rSARS-CoV-MA15 and rSARS-CoV-MA15-E infection was evaluated in 8-week-old mice intranasally infected with 6,000 PFU. in contrast, lung infiltrates were reduced in mice infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. eight-week-old mice were infected with 6,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. after 4 (A) and 6 (B) dpi, mice were sacrificed, and lungs were processed for histopathological examination. original magnifications were 4 and 40 in upper and lower images, respectively. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E and rSARS-CoV-MA15-E were infected with 100,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15 and rSARS-CoV-MA15. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E replicated less robustly in mice. weight loss and survival were evaluated daily. induction of proinflammatory cytokines was up to 70-fold higher in mice infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. expression levels of the gene encoding the 18S rRNA did not change in mock-, rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-, and rSARS-CoV-MA15-infected mice. expression levels of cellular mRNAs corresponding to proinflammatory cytokines were measured by RT-qPCR. number indicates levels of gene expression in rSARS-CoV-MA15-E- or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected mice compared to mock-infected mice. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E- or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected mice were infected with rSARS-CoV-MA15 virus induced the expression of higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines, particularly at 48 hpi (MOI of 0.5) and 48 to 72 hpi (MOI of 0.05) than the E deletion mutant. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E also induced a decreased proinflammatory response compared to that of rSARS-CoV-MA15 in infected cells. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E- or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected cells were plotted as fold change relative to expression levels in uninfected cells. the most important signal transduction pathways activated by viruses are mediated by transcription factors IRF3, IRF7, CRE, AP-1, NF-B, and NF-AT. the levels of p65 were measured as p50-p65 heterodimers. NF-B was activated to higher levels in rSARS-CoV-MA15-infected cells. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E and wild-type rSARS-CoV-MA15 virus were analyzed. levels of NF-B increased about 4-fold in rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected lungs. levels of NF-B increased about 4-fold in rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected lungs compared to mock-infected ones at day 2 p.i. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E (E)-, and rSARS-CoV-MA15 (wt)-infected mice were infected with 100,000 PFU of rSARS-CoV-MA15-E or rSARS-CoV-MA15-E. NF-B activity decreased in both cells treated with the four NF-B inhibitors compared to activity in nontreated cells. rSARS-CoV-MA15-infected cells were treated with NF-B inhibitors. expression levels of TNF, CCL2 and CXCL2 were clearly decreased. NF-B activation induces the expression of inflammatory cytokines after rSARS-CoV infection. rSARS-CoV-MA15- and mock-infected mice were treated intraperitoneally with CAPE, parthenolide, or both. all mock-infected mice treated with inhibitors showed no signs of clinical disease or weight loss and no mortality. survival increased to 55.6%, suggesting complementary effects of the drugs. total lung RNA from nontreated or treated mice was extracted. expression of TNF, CCL2, CXCL2 and a control RNA (18S rRNA) was evaluated by RT-qPCR. levels of the three cytokine mRNAs were significantly reduced. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E induced less inflammation in lungs than rSARS-CoV-MA15. this decrease in inflammation correlated with decreased expression of proinflammatory mediators. rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected mice may have resulted from a reduction of virus titers after mouse infection by rSARS-CoV-MA15. rSARS-CoV-E grew to lower titers than rSARS-CoV. but in spite of this, it induced an increased stress response and apoptosis. titers in the lungs of mice infected with recombinant SARS-CoVs were the same as in mice infected with rSARS-CoV. infected mice with rSARS-CoV-MA15, increased expression of inflammatory cytokine TNF, of chemokines CCL2, CCL5, CXCL1, CXCL2, and CXCL10 were also detected. increased levels of IL-6 and of chemokines such as CCL2 and CXCL10 were also detected compared to levels in rSARS-CoV-MA15-E-infected mice. administration of two inhibitors of NF-B, CAPE and parthenolide increased mouse survival after infection and was associated with reduced expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs. NF-B inhibitors may be useful antivirals in SARS therapy. antivirals target cellular protein activity rather than viral proteins. they are not likely to be negated by mutations in the virus genome. this strategy complements the development of candidate vaccines."}
