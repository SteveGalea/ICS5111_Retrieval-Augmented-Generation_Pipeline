{"summary": "rotavirus belongs to the family of Reoviridae and is a non-enveloped virus. its genome is enclosed in three concentric layers and is composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. it encodes six structural proteins (VP1 to 4 and VP6 to 7) and five nonstructural proteins (NSP1 to 5). the current study was initiated to identify potential ligands to BRV using phage display technology. using the phages bearing the ligands, we established a phage-based ELISA. the specificity, feasibility and suitability of the novel approach were compared to a commonly used quantitative real-time qPCR. the unbound phages were removed by 10 times wash with TBST. the bound phages were eluted by adding 100 L elution buffer. the eluate neutralized with 15 L 1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.1) was harvested. the phages were incubated with the coating viruses for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the phages were used as diagnostic reagents to detect a panel of viruses composed of bovine rotavirus (BRV), bovine herpesvirus type 1. all the viruses were diluted in 0.1 M NaHCO3 (pH8.6) to a final concentration of 1 g/ml and coated onto ELISA plates overnight at 4\u00b0C followed by ELISA as above. the OD492 values were determined. at least three independent experiments were repeated. the BRV were coated into ELISA plates overnight at 4\u00b0C. then, the wells were blocked with 5% skimmed milk for 4 h. after triple washes with TBST, the wells were sequentially incubated with anti-M13 antibody for 1 h. real-time PCR was performed using aBI PRISM 7500 real-time PCR machine. the real-time PCR mixture included 1 l of cDNA template (1 g), 25 l of SYBR Green PCR Mix, 1 l of SYBR Taq polymerase, 1 l of sense primer, 1 l of antisense primer and 20 l of sterile water. BRV strain HQ09 were propagated in the MA104 cells in the presence of trypsin (final concentration was 10 g/mL) and purified by differential centrifugation conventionally. the protein concentration diluted in PBS was measured by the reagent kit manufacturer. the coated viruses were replaced by the supernatant of MA104 culture. the titer of the phages in input, elute buffer (output) and that after amplification in E.coli were analyzed according to the manufacturer's instructions. the genome DNA of the phages was extracted and purified using a plasmid extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany) the gene encoding the exogenous peptides of M13 was amplified by PCR using the purified DNA template, sense primers: 5\u2032-TCACCTCGAAAGCAAGCTGA and antisense primer: 5\u2032-CCCTCATAGCTGA. negative-positive cutoff value was set by the average OD ratio of 100 field negative samples and 100 positive samples by phage-based ELISA. a negative-positive threshold for each assay was determined using the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet which was generated. the OD492 value of detected phage wells >0.15 was judged as positive results. sense primer 5\u2032- GTATCCTGACTCTCAAGTTAAT was used to amplify the housekeeping gene, beta-actin. a volume of 100 l of each sample's total RNA or RNA was extracted with a commercially available kit. PCR parameters were composed of 95\u00b0C for 2 min; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 10 s and 60\u00b0C for 35 s. the expression level of BRV VP6 was normalized to that of beta-actin according to the comparative cycle threshold (CT) method. phage-displayed peptides from combinatorial libraries have been selected [17]\u2013[21]. in this study, we used the BRV as an immobilized target followed by biopanning process using a 12-mer phage display peptide library. because the viruses were harvested from the cells, we performed a subtract panning to decrease potential reaction background. phages bearing peptides HVHPPLRPHSDK, YPTHHAHTTPVR or HATNHLPTPHNR were named phages HV, YP and HA respectively. the sequence data has been deposited in the GenBank and their accession numbers will be provided once available. the specific phages identified in this study may be specific and inexpensive assay reagents for detection of BRV. further tests are needed to analyze the utility of the phage-mediated ELISA in detection of BRV from clinical samples. the averaged YP, HV and HA OD of 60 negative sample in the ELISA was 0.129611,0.12645 and 0.12784. the positive threshold was set at 0.15 and all 60 positive samples had YP, HV and HA OD values below 0.15. the repeatability test was done by comparing OD ratios of triplicate results from each field stool sample tested in the same plate (intra-assay repeatability) the correlation between phage-based ELISA and qPCR was evaluated by determining the area under the ROC-curve (AUC) as high values close to 1 of the ROC-curve represent a highly accurate test, the phage-mediated ELISA is a rather sensitive diagnostic approach for BRV. the phage-mediated ELISA is a rather sensitive diagnostic approach for BRV. cDNA was ten-fold serially diluted and subjected to qPCR. the concentration of the viruses is indicated in the x axis. ELISA and qPCR assays were performed in triplicate. es from combinatorial libraries that interacting with hepatitis B virus, adenovirus type 2, andes virus have been selected [17]\u2013[21]. in this study, we used the BRV as an immobilized target followed by biopanning process using a 12-mer phage display peptide library. because the viruses were harvested from the cells, we performed a subtract panning to decrease potential reaction background. peptide sequences (12 amino acids in length) from selected phages were identified. phages bearing peptides HVHPPLRPHSDK, YPTHHAHTTPVR or HATNHLPTPHNR were named phages HV, YP and HA. the specific phages identified in this study may be specific and inexpensive assay reagents for detection of BRV. further tests are needed to analyze the utility of the phage-mediated ELISA in detection of BRV from clinical samples. the averaged YP, HV and HA OD of 60 negative samples in the ELISA was 0.129611,0.12645 and 0.12784. the positive threshold was set at 0.15 and all 60 positive samples had YP, HV and HA OD values below 0.15. the repeatability test was done by comparing OD ratios of triplicate results from each field stool sample tested in the same plate (intra-assay repeatability) phage-based ELISA and qPCR was evaluated by determining the area under the ROC-curve (ROC-curve) the ROC-analysis was very high and comparable AUC-values exceeding 0.9 using either the results of YP, HV or HA as one matrix. the dependency between GE of qPCR and OD extinction values of the established ELISA was analyzed using Spearman's rank test. the cDNA was ten-fold serially diluted and subjected to qPCR. the concentration of the viruses is indicated in the x axis. ELISA and qPCR assays were performed in triplicate."}
