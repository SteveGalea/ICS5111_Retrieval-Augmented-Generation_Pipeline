{"summary": "there have been 2,040 reported laboratory-confirmed cases and 712 deaths from MERS-CoV infection in 27 countries. a single imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome in south Korea, identified on 20 May 2015, resulted in 150 laboratory-confirmed cases and caused 15 deaths within 26 days. this highlighted the need for vigilant surveillance and the importance of swift and thorough contact tracing. RT-PCR for MERS-CoV on upper respiratory tract samples resulted in false negatives, leading to a 48-hour delay in diagnosis and a decision to transfer the patient out of the negative pressure unit on day 3. the patient was immediately transferred back into the NPU. south Korea, identified on 20 May 2015, resulted in 150 laboratory-confirmed cases, amplified by infection in hospitals and the transfer of patients within and between hospitals. this caused 15 deaths within 26 days, mainly among patients, visitors and healthcare personnel. the Thai Ministry of Public Health (MOPH) launched MERS surveillance and made MERS a notifiable disease in 2012. RT-PCR for MERS-CoV on upper respiratory tract samples resulted in false negatives, leading to a 48-hour delay in diagnosis and a decision to transfer the patient out of the negative pressure unit on day 3. the patient was immediately transferred back into the NPU. RNA was tested in sputum and via nasopharyngeal swab. two real-time RT-PCR assays targeting upstream of envelope and open reading frame 1a genes. one RT-PCR assay for generating amplicons for sequencing. all MERS-CoV genomes with complete coding sequences available in GenBank as of 30 December 2016 (n = 233) were selected and used for phylogenetic analysis. a phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method based on the general time reversible model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates in MEGA7 [13] local health authorities in relevant provinces were informed and asked by the investigation team to locate and contact the identified passengers. some passengers voluntarily reported to a hospital or health authority in response to the MOPH\u2019s announcement of first imported MERS case in Thailand. specimens were duplicated and sent to any two of three laboratories. high-risk close contacts were only released after 14 days of quarantine. if laboratory testing on the 12th day of quarantine was negative. case monitoring Respiratory specimens (sputum, nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) were collected daily from the index case from the time of patient isolation on day 5 through to day 17. a low-risk close-contact was defined as any person within 1 m of contact with the index case while the patient was symptomatic. people were considered non-contacts if there was no evidence of direct contact with the patient or if they were not likely to be in contact with respiratory droplets, the means of transmission for MERS-CoV. at the hospital, attending physicians\u2019 and nurses\u2019 contact status was determined via interview and the hospital surveillance camera. the index case was moved after being taken out of the NPU 8 hours before diagnosis on day 3. samples were collected and sent for testing to rule out MERS-CoV infection. nasopharyngeal swabs were negative for upE, ORF-1a and RdRp gene targets on days 2 and 3. the patient was transferred back to a non-NPU in the ICU that night. sputum was confirmed via sequencing within 24 hours by WHOCC. 185 nt of RdRp gene showed 99% (185/186 bp) identity to the 2015 MERS-CoV isolate from a human case in Riyadh. the patient\u2019s clinical presentation at that time was diffused bilateral pneumonia with pending acute respiratory distress syndrome. the patient was monitored for MERS until 1 July 2015. the patient was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus on 14 June 2015. he was discharged that day with a follow-up appointment at a regional hospital. the patient flew there on 15 June 2016. 211 contacts of the index case were identified after the patient was confirmed to have MERS. 211 contacts of the index case were identified after the patient was confirmed to have MERS. all patients treated in the same ward at the private hospital of first admission of index case before MERS diagnosis were identified as non-contact. the outbreak investigation determined there to be 41 low-risk contacts and this information was published on the dedicated WHO system. there was no secondary transmission associated with this case. high-risk close contacts Three of the patient\u2019s close relatives who (45, 30 and 25 years of age) travelled with the patient to Thailand and took care of the patient. their RT-PCR tests (each person tested four times) were negative for MERS-CoV. all but the 12 crew members were quarantined as the crew members left the country for their return flight operation on 15 June 2015 (day 1). the crew members were notified and self-quarantined for 14 days. none of the high-risk close contacts reported to have developed symptoms compatible with MERS-CoV infection during the quarantine period. positiveb 20 Jun 2015 6 Sputum and nasopharyngeal swab ND ND 21 Jun 2015 7 Nasopharyngeal swaba ND ND 22 Jun 2015 8 Nasopharyngeal swaba ND ND 22 Jun 2015 8 Nasopharyngeal swaba ND ND ND 22 Jun 2015 7 Nasopharyngeal swaba ND ND ND Ct: cycle threshold; MERS: the patient was admitted to a regional hospital in Oman on 4 June 2015. the condition was associated with shortness of breath on exertion. three days later, on 7 June 2015, his condition had improved and he was discharged. phylogenetic tree constructed from the MERS-CoV whole genome obtained from the patient (THA/CU/2015, 29,809 bp), among closest relatives and representatives for each MERS-CoV lineage defined by Sabir et al. [12]. 211 contacts of the index case were identified after the patient was confirmed to have MERS. all patients treated in the same ward were identified as non-contact. the outbreak investigation determined there to be 41 low-risk contacts. workers at the private hospital 17 All were immediately quarantined in the hospital. their laboratory testing was negative for MERS-CoV. close relatives at high-risk First sera 19 Jun 2015 (day 5) Second sera 1 Jul 2015 (day 17) 45 other high-risk close contacts, including 14 airline passengers who sat in the two rows around the index case\u2019s seat, 12 airline crew members, 17 healthcare workers at the private hospital (first hospital of admission) in Bangkok. initial chest radiographs did not show clear signs of interstitial pneumonia as expected with MERS-CoV infection. phone calls, passenger manifests, surveillance videos and immigration cards were essential tools for the successful contact tracing. upper respiratory tract samples, such as nasopharyngeal, are often used to detect upper respiratory tract illnesses during the acute phase. simultaneous assays and sequencing for upE, ORF-1a and RdRp genes in parallel allowed for swift in-country confirmation of the presence of MERS-CoV. there was no secondary transmission, not even to close relatives or the healthcare workers at BIDI where the patient was transferred after the diagnosis was confirmed."}
