{"summary": "IB is caused by the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) which belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, genus Gammacoronavirus. mortality rate can be high in young chickens, especially with other secondary complications such as viral and bacterial infections. epitope-based vaccines have been widely studied for safety, genetic stability, ease of production, and the ability to elicit immune responses against multi serotype pathogens. most important factors for designing a multi-epitope vaccine are predicting and screening the functional neutralizing B cell epitopes and species-restricted T cell epitopes. the recombinant DNA vaccine, consisting of this IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette, could induce a high level of immune responses and full protection of chickens against a lethal dose of IBV challenge. the results indicated that the multi-epitope-based vaccine provides a promising strategy for vaccine development against IBV infection. the velogenic NDV genotype IX strain F48E9 and Massachusetts IBV strain M41 were stored in our laboratory at \u201370 \u00b0C. the 50% embryo infectious dose (EID50) of a virus in harvested allantoic fluid was calculated by the Reed and Muench mathematical technique. clone pBR-LS was linearized at the 5\u2032-NTR of the NDV LS M gene by PCR using an In-fusion PCR clone kit. pBR-LS was fused with gene-end (GE), intergenic (IG), gene-start (GS) and Kozak sequences. the plasmid, named pNDV-IBV-T/B, was confirmed by sequencing analysis. the viruses were harvested by freeze-thawing for 3 times and serially passaged 20 times (P20) in 10-day-old SPF chicken embryos. all the passages rNDV-IBV-T/B whole genome were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) rNDV-IBV-T/B and parental virus LaSota strain were characterized using the standard hemagglutination test (HA) and the 50% tissue infectious dose (TCID50) assay on DF-1 cells in 96-well plates, and the 50% egg infective dose (EID50) assay in nine-day-old SPF chicken embryos. Western blotting analyzed the antigenicity of the multi-epitope cassette chimera of rNDV-IBV-T/B was propagated in nine-day-old SPF chicken embryos. four milliliters of rNDV-IBV-T/B were layered on top of a step gradient of 60%, 50%, 40%, and 25% w/v sucrose prepared in milli-Q water. a total of 90 one-day-old SPF white leghorn chicks were randomly divided into six groups. group A and B were administered with rNDV-IBV-T/B at dose of 106 EID50 per chicken, and group C and D were inoculated with PBS by the same route. the control groups E and F were inoculated with PBS by the same route. HI assays were conducted in V-bottomed microwell plates. rNDV-IBV-T/B, LaSota, and sera were isolated for serological tests 21 days post-immunization. all tests were repeated in duplicate. IBV RNA was amplified using the forward primer IBV5\u2032GU391 5\u2032-GCTTTTGAGCCTAGCGTT-3\u2032. the reverse primer IBV5\u2032GL533 5\u2032-GCCATGTTGTCACTGTCTATTG-3\u2032 detected by TaqMan dual-labeled IBV5\u2032G probe. the cycling program was set up with 95 \u00b0C for 3 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 56 \u00b0C for 25 a maximum possible ciliostasis score of 40 suggested complete ciliostasis. a maximum possible ciliostasis score of 40 suggested complete ciliostasis (total lack of protection) overlapping cDNA fragments covering the complete genome of the NDV LaSota strain were amplified by RT-PCR using genomic RNA as a template. the five cDNA fragments were assembled into a modified pBR322 vector under the control of the T7 promotor and followed by a partial Hepatitis D virus (HDV) ribozyme and T7 terminator, resulting in a full-length cDNA clone, named p the pV-IBV-T/B, pV-NP, pV-P, and pV-L plasmids were co-transfected into the replication-deficient vaccinia virus. at 6 h post-transfection, cells were washed twice, then cultured in DMEM containing 1% penicillin (10,000 IU)-streptomycin (10,000 g/mL) and 0.2 g/mL N-to RT-PCR was performed using 2 L of rNDV-IBV-T/B cDNA, 10 mol each of the primers (F-5\u2019 GCTAGCGCCACCATGGGAAATTACGTTT-3\u2019, R-5\u2019- CTCGAGTTACGGTTGACTACCAGTAGCG-3\u2019), 10 L PCR master mix (2X) in a total volume of 20 L. DF1 cells were harvested 36 h post-infection, lysed, and proteins were separated on a 10% SDS polyacrylamide gel (SDS-PAGE) after electrophoresis, proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) filter membrane. the membrane was incubated with an HRP-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. four milliliters of rNDV-IBV-T/B were layered on top of a step gradient of 60%, 50%, 40%, and 25% w/v sucrose prepared in milli-Q water. the virus-containing band between the 40% and 50% layers was collected and 5 l of rNDV-IBV-T/B virus was placed onto the shiny side of an EM grid and then adsorbed for 3 min. vaccination, groups A and C, and control group E were challenged with 106 EID50 of the velogenic NDV strain F48E9. the lethal dose of the challenge virus had been determined by an experimental chicken infection study. five challenged chickens from groups A and C were subjected to ciliostasis tests at 4 days post-challenge. tracheal swab samples were randomly taken from five chickens from each group 4 dpc. rNDV-IBV-T/B in preventing shedding of IBV in immunized chickens. RNA was extracted using a high pure RNA Isolation Kit. tracheal explants were examined on 10 tracheal ring explants per chicken (5 chickens of each group) 5 dpc. the tracheas were carefully removed and examined for ciliary activity within 2 h after collection. a maximum possible ciliostasis score of 40 suggested complete ciliostasis (total lack of protection) pNDV-IBV-T/B was co-transfected with three helper plasmids, pV-NP, pV-P, and pV-L, into MVA-T7-infected BHK cells. the cell lysates were harvested, filtered, and inoculated into SPF embryonated chicken eggs. the sequence of the full-length multi-epitope cassette S-T/B was examined by RT- expression of the IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette and the NDV NP protein was found at 35 and 53 kDa bands in P1 and P20 of rNDV-IBV-T/B lysates. rNDV-IBV-T/B successfully expressed the protein multi-epitope cassette in vitro. rNDV-IBV-T/B epitope cassette and NP proteins were detected as approximately 35 kDa and 53 kDa bands. rNDV-IBV-T/B epitope cassette and NP proteins were detected as approximately 35 kDa and 53 kDa bands. rNDV-IBV-T/B has a lower ICPI (p > 0.05) than LaSota (0.10). the presence of the IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette did not significantly affect the growth characteristics of rNDV-IBV-T/B. transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation on purified rNDV-IBV-T/B and LaSota strains. rNDV-IBV-T/B appears as circles or ovals about 100 to 150 nm in diameter. virions are marked by arrows. titer against NDV and virus neutralization (VN) antibody titer against IBV are expressed as mean log2 standard deviation. rNDV-IBV-T/B group against IBV M41 strain showed approximately 6.82 0.26, which was significantly higher than the laSota and PBS groups\u2019 (no VN activity detected) most chickens vaccinated with rNDV-IBV-T/B showed significantly less clinical signs after IBV challenge. survival rate of the rNDV-IBV-T/B group was 90%. all chickens in these two groups died within eight days post IBV challenge. rNDV-IBV-T/B vaccination significantly decreases IBV virion shedding compared with chickens not vaccinated with the IBV epitope-based vaccine (p 0.05) it is probable that rNDV-IBV-T/B effectively activated the immune response and suppressed viral replication. group Ciliostasis score a Protection Rate b (%) LaSota 37.6 0 rNDV-IBV-T/B 4.2 90 PBS 39.4 0 a. Mean ciliostasis score per chicken for 10 tracheas examined in each group. maximum possible score (no protection) = 40. rNDV-IBV-T/B was amplified from the plasmid pV-S1B+S1T. the cassette contained three neutralizing epitopes (P1\u2013P3), four BF2-restricted T cell epitopes (P8, P9, P18, P19) and was linked with flexible amino acids. parental virus strain LaSota only had 53 kDa NP protein band. rNDV-IBV-T/B successfully expressed the IBV S1 protein multi-epitope cassette in vitro. expression of the protein was stable, indicating genetic stability of rNDV-IBV-T/B. titers of rNDV-IBV-T/B reached 6.5 108/ml and 6.7 108/mL respectively. the TCID50 titer of rNDV-IBV-T/B (3.7 107/mL) was slightly higher than that of laSota (3.6 107/mL) at 48 h post-infection. transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observation on purified rNDV-IBV-T/B and parental LaSota strains. rNDV-IBV-T/B virus appeared as circles or ovals about 100 to 150 nm in diameter. mean HI titers of NDV in serum samples of chickens immunized with rNDV-IBV-T/B, LaSota, and PBS were 6.6 0.3, 6.7 0.4, and 0, respectively, which are expressed as log2 mean plus standard deviation. rNDV-IBV-T/B could induce high levels of HI titer as laSota vaccine against NDV challenge. one-day-old chicks were immunized with rNDV-IBV-T/B virus or PBS. chickens inoculated with PBS manifested clinical symptoms on day two post NDV challenge. all chickens in these two groups died within eight days post IBV challenge. chickens vaccinated with rNDV-IBV-T/B, LaSota, or PBS. three weeks post-immunization, chickens were challenged with 106 ELD50 of the NDV F48E9 strain (A) and IBV M41 strain (B). survival rate of was calculated and compared by log-rank tests. rNDV-IBV-T/B reduced the pathogenicity of IBV toward the trachea. rNDV-IBV-T/B reduced the pathogenicity of IBV towards the trachea. rNDV-IBV-T/B induced an effective immune response against the IBV M41 strain. in recent decades, attempts have been made to develop recombinant vaccines using NDV [48,49,50], adenovirus [51], duck enteritis virus [52], and avian metapneumovirus [53] viral backbones expressing the S1 or S2 portion of the IBV spike gene. avirulent NDV strain LaSota is an ideal vector that has been approved for use as a vaccine and widely used worldwide. the genetic stability of rNDV-IBV-T/B was confirmed by DNA sequencing. the morphology of the recombinant progeny virus remained the same as the parental LaSota. the immune-protection experiment showed that a single immunization of one-day-old chicks with rNDV-IBV-T/B could protect 100% and 90% chicks against lethal doses of F48E9 and M41 strain. id et al. used the prime-boost immunization strategy to evaluate the efficacy of the recombinant NDV vaccine, rLS/IBV.S2. the results showed that overexposing IBV S2 to the chicken immune system by means of a vectored vaccine, followed by boosting with the whole virus, protects chickens against heterologous IBV. the rNDV-IBV-T/B provides an alternative strategy for the development of a cost-effective and extensively immune-protective vaccine."}
