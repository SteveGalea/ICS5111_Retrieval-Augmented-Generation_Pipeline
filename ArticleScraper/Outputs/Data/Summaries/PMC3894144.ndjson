{"summary": "the prevalence, morbidity, mortality, and overall health hazards have increased in recent years. the number of DM patients worldwide has been estimated at about 347 million,1 with about 7 million of those classified as new cases. up to 2008, 3.9 million people had died from DM, with 80% of the deaths occurring in low and middle-income countries. TB is more likely to occur in young, thin, and frail patients with DM, lipidemia, or vitamin A deficiency. TB is more likely to occur in young, thin, and frail patients with DM, lipidemia, or vitamin A deficiency. two genes, HK2 and CD28, have been considered potential culprits in DM-increased TB susceptibility. decreased expression of HK2 may impair macrophage function, thus increasing the risk of TB. there were 1 million cases of TB and 47,000 deaths from the disease in the People\u2019s Republic of China in 2011. resistance to TB drugs has been reported at a rate of more than 46%. the prevalence of DM in the People\u2019s Republic of China has increased rapidly from 1% in the 1980s to 4.5% in 2002 and 9.7% in 2010.24 The prevalence of pre-DM (a condition in which blood glucose levels are higher than normal, but not high enough to be classified as full-blown DM) the prevalence of pre-DM has increased rapidly from 1% in the 1980s to 4.5% in 2002. patients with positive symptoms were referred to TB clinics for further investigation. between 68% and 79% of patients with DM were recorded as having been screened for TB. among the 15,342 patients screened in the study, seven were identified as having TB. TB cases and TB + DM cases ranked highest in 2011 and in 2012. TB cases and TB + DM cases ranked highest in 2011 and in 2012. males were overrepresented in the TB + DM group, compared to the TB-only group. there were 41 serious cases of DM (7.2%), which was higher than in the TB-only group. the TB-only group had 1,315 patients with other infections, with a rate of 22.5%, clearly lower than the DM group. at the Chinese PLA 309 Hospital, Beijing, People\u2019s Republic of China Clinical TB TB + DM Total Positive AFB in PTB 913/3,934 (23.2%) 216/445 (48.5%) 1,129/6,421 (17.6%) Serious cases 194/5,854 (3.3%) 41/567 (7.2%) 235/6,421 (3.66%) Concurrent infection 1,315/5,854 (22.5%) 236/567 (41.6%) 1,551/6,421 (24.1 the frequency of TB among patients with DM in the People\u2019s Republic of China is about 958 per 100,000 people. this is much higher than that of the general population (78 per 100,000), according to the WHO."}
