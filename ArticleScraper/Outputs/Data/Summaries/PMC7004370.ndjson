{"summary": "viral positive tests and daily ED visits and hospitalizations are unclear. the percentage of positive tests to influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza and adenovirus prevalence explained 57.4% of ED visits and 63.8% of hospitalizations for RTI. the Canadian Respiratory Virus Detection Surveillance program consists of a network of laboratories, hospitals, physician offices and provincial and territorial ministries of health. the aim of the program is to detect and respond to outbreaks, use data on viruses to improve and inform health programs and policies. the surveillance system was setup in 2003 using multiplex polymerase chain reaction to detect 5 viruses. the yearly and seasonal trend was also explored over the study period. data is reported on a weekly basis for respiratory viruses. daily ED visits and hospitalizations were expressed per 105 of the population. influenza A & B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus over the final 3 years (Period B) the contribution of individual viruses was performed using the Pearson correlation co-efficient. all analyses were performed in TIBCO Statistica (Academic Package v13.2). the daily rates for ED visits and hospitalizations were expressed per 105 of the population. influenza A & B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus were studied over 11 years (Period A) and influenza A & B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus. the daily % positive response of each virus was correlated with ED visits and hospitalizations for 5 viruses over 11 years. ED visits and hospitalizations for RTIs, asthma and COPD were strongly and similarly influenced by influenza A, followed by coronavirus, hMPV and then influenza B. daily events Inf A % positive Inf B % positive RSV % positive Para Inf % positive Adeno % positive Emergency Department Visits RTI 0.61 0.33 0.49 -0.29 -0.10 COPD 0.51 0.35 0.35 -0.27 -0.14 Asthma 0.06 -0.01 0.01 -0.10 -0.09 Hospitalizations RTI 0.58 0.26 0.63 -0.35 -0.14 COPD 0.50 0.33 0. influenza A & B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus explained 66.7% of the daily variance in ED visits with RTI. most of the variance in RTIs was explained by Influenza A, RSV, and hRV. influenza A & B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus explained 41.4% of the daily variance in ED visits with COPD. influenza A & B, RSV, parainfluenza, adenovirus, hMPV, hRV and coronavirus explained 52.5% of the daily variance in ED visits with COPD. yearly and seasonal variations in ED visits and hospitalizations for RTIs, asthma and COPD. daily rates of ED visits and hospitalizations with asthma declined by almost 45% between 2003 and 2013. there was a 19% increase in the daily rates of ED visits. visits and hospitalizations for asthma were highest in the fall [1.39 per 105 (1.37\u20131.72), and 0.15 per 105 (0.146\u20130.154), respectively] and the lowest in the summer [1.05 per 105 (1.03\u20131.08), and 0.095 per 105 [0.091\u20130.096] respectively. daily rates per 105 expressed on a log2 scale. daily % positive response of each virus was correlated with ED visits and hospitalizations for 5 viruses over 11 years. ED visits and hospitalizations for RTIs, asthma and COPD were strongly and similarly influenced by influenza A, followed by coronavirus, hMPV and then influenza B.
