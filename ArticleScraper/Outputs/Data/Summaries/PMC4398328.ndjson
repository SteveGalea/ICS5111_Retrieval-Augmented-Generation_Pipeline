{"summary": "non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses can cause diseases of the upper and lower respiratory, gastrointestinal, and ocular systems [1]. Respiratory infection caused by AdV in non-immunocompromised patients is usually mild and self-limited. in immunocompromised patients, AdV infection can be disseminated and result in a considerable mortality rate. records of all consecutive patients diagnosed with AdV pneumonia between December 1, 2012 and June 1, 2014 at the Armed Forces Capital Hospital in Gyeonggi province, south Korea. the diagnosis was considered certain when it was associated with: 1) lower respiratory and/or systemic symptoms, 2) lung infiltration on chest radiography or computed tomography (CT) scan. only non-immunocompromised adult patients who fulfilled the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia requiring admission to the intensive care unit are one patient management Patients who presented with acute respiratory symptoms that deteriorated rapidly despite use of appropriate broad-spectrum antibiotics for 2\u20133 days were suspected of having atypical pneumonia [25], and underwent thorough examinations. multiplex real time PCR testing for respiratory viruses was performed on the MagNA Pure LC 2.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) the presence of specific viral sequences in the reaction was detected by an increase in the FAM, VIC and Cy5 fluorescence from the relevant dual-labeled probe. the serotype of human-AdV-positive samples was evaluated by sequence analysis using the partial hexon genomic region. major criteria include: invasive mechanical ventilation and requiring vasopressors due to septic shock. minor criteria include: 1) respiratory rate 30/min, 2) PaO2/FiO2 ratio 250 mmHg, 3) multilobar pneumonia in chest radiographs, 4) decreased level of consciousness, 5) blood urea nitrogen 20 mg/dL, 6) white blood cells 4,000/mm3, 7) platelets 100,000/mm3, 8) core temperature 36\u00b0C, and 9) hypotension multiplex real time PCR assay for respiratory viruses Nucleic acid extraction was performed on the MagNA Pure LC 2.0. more than fifty microliters of clinical samples were used for nucleic acid extraction and eluted in 50 l of elution buffer. total dose of 2-g probenecid was given orally 3 h before infusion, and 1 g at 2 and 8 h after the cidofovir infusion. results Eleven patients were newly diagnosed with AdV pneumonia and admitted during the study period; all were non-immunocompromised adults. four patients did not fulfill the criteria for severe community-acquired pneumonia. 4 39.8 40.0 39.6 40.0 39.6 40.0 39.6 40.0 SpO2 on room air (%) 86 88 90 89 85 90 NA PaO2 on room air (mmHg) 49.4 53.3 54.0 61.5 56.0 58.5 NA PaO2/FiO2 ratio (mmHg) 235.2 253.8 257.1 292.9 266.7 278.6 245.0 Need for oxygen application + + + + + + + ICU admission + + + + + + + six (86%) patients had tachycardia (>100 beats/min) or tachypnea (>30 breaths/min) three (43%) patients needed vasopressors and mechanical ventilation. median duration from onset of symptoms to admission was 5 days. lobe left upper lobe \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Both lower lobes \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 both lower lobes \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 CT, computed tomography; +, positive;-, negative. all patients had thrombocytopenia 16.5 17.5 15.3 34.2 27.1 16.3 Neutrophil- lymphocyte ratio 2.5 4.9 4.4 5.2 1.6 2.4 4.8 CRP (mg/dL) 7.22 8.31 13.13 11.67 6.85 5.71 11.87 ESR (mm/h) 3 14 20 15 4 14 14 Procalcitonin (ng/mL) 24.23 0.57 NA 1.41 2.0 0.19 0.79 Hyponatremia \u2013 + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 AdV was identified in all patients by PCR in sputum (n = 7) and BAL fluid (n = 2).
