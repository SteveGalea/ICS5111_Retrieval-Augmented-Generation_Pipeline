{"summary": "researchers recruited study participants among physicians and nurses of the emergency department of Samsung Medical Center in Seoul, Korea. participants were asked to carry out doffing and donning procedures with a helper after a 50-minute brief training and demonstration. a trained examiner inspected all video recordings and coded for intervals, errors, and contaminations. a limited number of studies have been performed regarding contamination with PPE usage. the study was performed in a single tertiary-level academic hospital. the hospital has a disaster plan and equipment such as PPE. each participant completed the donning and doffing procedures with help from the partner. each team was blinded from the others; however, the second participants were more exposed to the process after watching the first. the 2014 CDC protocol was close to level D. errors were determined when the participants violated the order of procedures even with the help of their partners. if a participant skipped putting on a second glove and proceeded to the next procedure, this was counted as an error. the course contains donning and doffing procedure for PPE (gowns, gloves, respirators, and goggles), according to a 2014 CDC protocol. each participant was paired with another, and completed the donning and doffing procedures with help from the partner. each team was blinded from the others; however, the second participants were more exposed to the process after watching the first. two cameras with high-density capability were set up at an approximate 120 degree angle to document the process. a trained examiner reviewed all video recordings and coded timer intervals and errors. errors were determined when the participants violated the order of procedures even with the help of their partners. the average donning process interval was 234.2 seconds (SD, 65.7) from start to finish. most frequent errors occurred while putting on outer gloves (27.6%), respirator (20.7%), and hood (20.7%). the average interval during doffing was 183.7 seconds (SD, 38.4) from start to finish. most frequent errors occurred during disinfecting feet, discarding scrubs (17.2%), and putting on gloves (13.8%) total 187 (154\u2013209) 38 Values are presented as median (interquartile range) or number (%) during the overall doffing process, 65 contamination incidents occurred. the most vulnerable process was removing respirators. more intensive education and training is required for safe doffing. previous studies have focused on the importance of PPE, potential risks of doffing procedures, and doffing procedure experiments comparing different systems with few subjects. the study protocol was not identical to 2014 CDC guidelines. it excluded aprons, leg covers, and tape seals between parts of gear. this could be the reason that donning and doffing procedures were finished in very short intervals."}
