{"summary": "chemokine is a ligand for CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4). it is predominantly expressed on Th2 lymphocytes, basophils and natural killer cells. previous studies have shown that the MDC level is elevated in the serum and skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) phosphorylation plays a critical role in IFN-mediated immunity to microbial infection, especially inflammatory responses. it is also known that IFN- also stimulates the activation of p38 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) the biological effects of dieckol in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced murine macrophages are poorly understood. the biological effects of dieckol and its action mechanisms in skin inflammation including atopic dermatitis are poorly understood. the cells were cultured in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin. the cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2. lysis buffer disrupted in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Nonident P-40, 2 mM ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1 mM NaVO3, 10 mM NaF, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 25 all antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in TTBS buffer. the membrane was incubated with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated anti-primary antibody host immunoglobulin G (IgG) diluted 1 : 5000 for 1 h at room temperature. human interferon- (hIFN-: recombinant E.coli) was purchased from Gibco (Grand Island, NY, USA) anti-phospho-STAT1 antibody was purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA) anti-actin antibody, Epigallocatechingallate (EGCG) and PD98059 were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA) odophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenyl)-5-(2,4-disulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium was added to each well and incubated for 1 h in an incubator. the absorbance of each well was measured at 450 nm with a VersaMax ELISA microplate reader. extracts containing 30 g of protein were loaded next to a prestained protein-mass ladder (Bio-Rad) the proteins were electroblotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane by using an iBlot gel transfer device (Invitrogen) the membrane was blocked with blocking buffer (5% skim milk in Tween 20-Tris buffered saline) for 1 h at room temperature. the cells were incubated with primary anti-STAT1 antibodies overnight at 4\u00b0C. the cells were washed and then incubated with donkey anti-rabbit (BioLegend, San Diego, CA, USA) for 30 min at room temperature. production in IFN--stimulated HaCaT keratinocytes is 118.0 8.3 pg/mL. eckol failed to inhibit the cytokine-stimulated production of MDC. but dieckol significantly suppressed the production of MDC by IFN- in a concentration-dependent manner. atinocytes STAT1 protein is a crucial regulator of IFN--induced signals that controls the transcription of target genes, including MDC. we tested the effect of dieckol on the activation of STAT1 in IFN--treated HaCaT keratinocytes. immunofluorescence staining for STAT1 was performed by using a primary antibody against STAT1 followed by a DyLight488- conjugated secondary antibody. the images were acquired at constant two-photon excitation microscopy (PMT), gain, offset, magnification and resolution. PKs pathway does not contribute on the production of MDC in IFN--stimulated HaCaT cells. the results suggest that MAPKs pathway does not contribute on the production of MDC in IFN--stimulated HaCaT cells. eckol and dieckol did not exhibit cytotoxicity to HaCaT keratinocytes. the cells were treated with different concentrations of eckol and dieckol for 24 h. the cells were treated with different concentrations of eckol and dieckol. haCaT cells were stimulated with IFN- (10 ng/mL) in the presence or absence of eckol or dieckol for 24 h. the amounts of MDC were measured from the culture supernatants. the inhibitory effect of dieckol on the production of MDC occurs through inhibiting the activation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 in IFN--stimulated HaCaT keratinocytes. the phosphorylation of STAT1 was determined in cells stimulated with IFN- (10 ng/mL) for 15 min. we first determined time dependent activation of three MAPKs (ERK, JNK, p38) after IFN- treatment. PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor, 10 M), strongly suppressed ERK phosphorylation. dieckol did not inhibit ERK phosphorylation. haCaT cells (5.0 105 cells/mL) were pre-treated with PD98059 (a specific ERK inhibitor, 10 M) or dieckol (2.5, 5, 10 M) for 2 h and stimulated by IFN- (10 ng/mL) for 5 mins. dieckol suppressed MDC production in a dose dependent manner, while eckol was not effective. the promoter region of the MDC gene contains binding units for signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) dieckol suppressed STAT1 (at serine 727) phosphorylation induced by IFN-. the effect of dieckol on the STAT1 phosphorylation is stronger than that of EGCG, a specific STAT inhibitor. MAPKs pathway did not affect the production of MDC in IFN--stimulated HaCaT cells. results suggest that MAPKs pathway does not contribute significantly on the production of MDC."}
