{"summary": "apo and holo ISAV HE17\u2013353 elutes at a volume consistent with an elongated trimer. the resulting ISAV HE17\u2013353 exhibits proper esterase activity. crystals of apo and holo were obtained and diffracted at 1.8 and 2.0 resolution. a schematic representation of the domain structure of ISAV HE. the predicted N-linked glycosylation site at N333 is depicted as a red Y. CT, cytoplasmic tail; SP, signal peptide; TM: transmembrane domain. ISAV HE17\u2013353 is a cold-adapted pathogen and a facultative halophile. the fusion of host and cellular membranes occurs at 12\u201315 \u00b0C. the positively charged character of the pocket is complementary to the negatively charged 4-OAS. the 4-O-acetyl group forms a hydrogen bond with the backbone nitrogen of R139 on protomer 1. the carbonyl oxygen and guanidinyl group of R139 also make hydrogen bonds with N5 and the carboxylate at carbon C1 of 4-OAS. mediated by intermolecular interactions within both the RBD and the esterase domain. mediated by extensive intermolecular interactions within both the RBD and the esterase domain. residues S32, D261, and H264 generate a canonical ser-His-Asp catalytic triad with esterase activity. a formate ion mimics the acetate product of the ISAV HE esterase reaction. the distance between the P1 and P2 pockets in the ISAV HE active site is 6. 4-OAS by a type 2 murine coronaviral HE (8) is 6 apart, housing the 4-O-acetyl and the 5-N-acetyl moiety in P1 and P2 respectively. 9-O-acetylsialic acid binding type 1 HE esterases bind a 9-O-acetylsialic acid via P1 and P2 pockets that allow the coordination of the 9-O-acetyl moiety in recombinant ISAV HE17\u2013353 copurifies with near-stoichiometric amounts of Ca2+ and detectable amounts of Zn2+ and Cu2+. incubation of ISAV HE17\u2013353 with 50 mM MgCl2 is mildly destabilizing (Tm= 2 \u00b0C) divalent cation binding in the stalk domain does not play a role in stabilizing the ISAV HE trimer. most class 1 viral glycoproteins (including ISAV F) coordinate a negatively charged Cl ion at the trimer interface of its fusion subunit. ISAV HE shares no sequence similarity to influenza A and B virus neuraminidases or the paramyxoviral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase. primary sequence of ISAV HE appears to be most similar to ORF 95 of the anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1), an aquaculture pathogen that causes hemorrhagic lesions. the global organization of the RBD and esterase domain of ISAV HE protomer is comparable to that of coronaviral HE proteins, toroviral HE proteins, and influenza C and D virus HEF1 protomers. despite similarities, ISAV HE has unique adaptations to allow for engagement of the viral receptor. substitutions within a conserved RBD-fold lead to the recognition of several different sialic acids. recognition of 4-OAS by ISAV HE occurs through the generation of a distinct binding site found at the trimerization interface between ISAV protomers. the expression of ISAV F on the surface of cultured cells is sufficient for syncytia formation when these cells are exposed to low-pH media. a conformational rearrangement of HN causes a conformational rearrangement of HN that transmits the bound-state signal to the paramyxoviral F protein. in contrast, 4-OAS receptor binding does not induce a conformational change in ISAV HE, and thus is not likely the trigger to activate ISAV a vaccine based on a salmonid alphavirus (SAV) replicon designed to induce the expression of HE provides protective immunity (36). the inclusion of SAV replicons that express ISAV F protein or the ISAV matrix protein did not improve the efficacy of the vaccine, indicating that presence of the HE protein is sufficient to generate a protective immune response. ISAV HE surface conservation across ISAV HE isolates. a comparison of ISAV surface residues indicates that there is extensive conservation throughout the global reservoir of ISAV isolates. the apo ISAV HE17\u2013353 structure was determined by a native sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (S-SAD) method. three noncovalently attached monomers adopt a \u201cbroccoli floret\u201d shape. each protomer is divided into three functional domains: the receptor binding domain (RBD), the esterase domain, and the stalk domain. ISAV HE17\u2013353 trimerization is stabilized by an extensive interface involving 58 residues from all three domains. the interface is mainly hydrophobic in nature, with no salt bridges and only 12 hydrogen bonds identified between adjacent protomers. the ISAV HE RBD forms a two-layer -sandwich of eight antiparallel -strands arranged into an Ig-like domain. it is linked to the esterase domain by a small antiparallel two-stranded -sheet comprised of 5 and 13 of the esterase domain. isAV receptor-binding is distinct from other viral hemagglutinin-esterase proteins. hemagglutinin-esterase proteins are mediated by intermolecular interactions. ISAV HE is composed of two discontinuous regions (E1: residues 17\u2013126; E2: 213\u2013299) separated by the RBD. the esterase domain contains a central four-stranded parallel -sheet. there are five intramolecular disulfide bonds per protomer. in the ISAV HE active site is 6, with V39 generating a hydrophobic platform at the base of P2 for the terminal methyl of the 5-N-acetyl moiety. this formate ion is coordinated through hydrogen bond interactions with the sidechain of N89 and the backbone nitrogen of S32. the ion is further coordinated by hydrogen bond interactions with the sidechain of N89 and the backbone nitrogen of S32. HE (13), bovine coronavirus HE (14), and the structures of influenza C virus and influenza D virus HEF proteins (7, 9) the distance between the P1 and P2 pockets is 8 and explains the differences in sialic acid substrate observed between type 1 and type 2 HE proteins. incubation of ISAV HE17\u2013353 with 50 mM MgCl2 is mildly destabilizing (Tm= 2 \u00b0C) this suggests that divalent cation binding in the stalk domain does not play a role in stabilizing the ISAV HE trimer. ISAV HE shares no sequence similarity to influenza A and B virus neuraminidases or the paramyxoviral hemagglutinin-neuraminidase. primary sequence alignments indicate some similarity to torovirus and coronavirus HE proteins (25%) the primary sequence of the ISAV HE protein appears to be most similar (32%) to ORF 95 of the anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV-1), an aquaculture pathogen that causes hemorrhagic lesions in farmed eel (17). conservation of the locations of cysteine residues within the primary sequence and stretches of amino acids within the esterase domain and the RBD are worth noting. orthomyxoviral HA and toro- and coronaviral HE proteins classically recognize 9-O-acetylsialic acid as their viral receptor. orthomyxoviral HA and HEF protomers also bind to a single viral receptor independently. the virus is subsequently endocytosed by the host cell. acidic lakes (pH 6.5) can reach the optimal pH for ISAV fusion when this cycle reaches its nadir. acidification of salmo salar ecosystems via acid deposition from anthropogenic sources could also generate a fusogenic milieu. studies of avian influenza show that pH 6.6 in freshwater habitats can negatively affect viral infectivity. fusion of the viral and endosomal membranes allows the release of the segmented viral genome into the cytoplasm and ER. the viral genomic RNA is then translocated into the nucleus. the esterase activity of ISAV HE destroys the 4-OAS-containing receptors on the membrane to release the virus from the host cell. innate immune response to ISAV infection includes increased expression of Mx and interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) via an IFN-independent mechanism (38), as well as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) expression. this characteristic innate immune response is not observed in salmon with protective immunity to ISAV induced by vaccination resulting in humoral immunity. ISAV HE17\u2013353 was stably expressed in Drosophila S2 cells at 20 \u00b0C with a C-terminal deca-histidine tag for purification by Ni-affinity chromatography. a 4-nitrophenol acetate hydrolysis esterase assay was used to ensure the recombinant protein was functional. HE structure was refined to final Rwork/Rfree values of 13.9%/18.3%. crystals were diffracted at the Canadian Light Source and Advanced Photon Source."}
