RNA regions upstream of position 7 and downstream of position +2 are largely disordered in the C3S6 structure. a portion of RNA backbone electron density of the disordered upstream RNA is somewhat traceable. a portion of RNA backbone electron density of the disordered upstream RNA is somewhat traceable. Cyan mesh indicates the 2Fo-Fc electron density map contoured at 1. green/red mesh indicates the Fo-Fc electron density map contoured at 3. black dots indicate the center of the map. the map radius is 30. RNA, pyrophosphate (PPi) and residue D238 overlaid are shown in Fig. 3A. RNA-only comparison of the translocation intermediate (Left: template in cyan) and the pretranslocation complex (dark gray) in the same NAC. polymerase interactions with the template strand are clustered in two distinct regions around the 5 to 3 and 2 to +1 nucleotides. motifs B, F, and G converge at the 2 to +1 region and create a sharp turn in the template strand. the template strand and the polymerase remained largely unchanged. more than half of residues participating in product strand contacts changed their interactions modes by interacting with a different site, losing original interactions or establishing additional interactions. this finding is consistent with the observation that the interactions between the polymerase and the product RNA are relatively nonintensive and evenly distributed. a unique EV71 RdRP EC crystal lattice allows multiple nucleotide-incorporation events. the upstream duplex points toward a spacious solvent channel. the black dot indicates the center of the map, and symmetry-related neighboring ECs are labeled as Sym1/2/3. the EC in this crystal was obtained after incorporating a (GA)3 hexa-nucleotide sequence into an RdRP\u2013RNA binary complex containing an 8-bp template\u2013primer duplex. the remaining \u201cGGACCU...\u201d template sequence was designed to direct subsequent in-crystal elongation as may be allowed by this particular lattice. data collection Space group P212121 P212121 P212121 Cell dimensions a, b, c, 63.1, 77.6, 153.6 63.3, 77.1, 149.9 63.7, 77.3, 149.7 63.4, 76.6, 149.3,,,, \u00b0 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90, 90 RMSD Bond lengths, 0.008 0.008 0.008 0.008 0.008 0.008 Bond angles, \u00b0 1.13 1.13 1.12 1.17 Ramachandran statistics 91.2/8.3/0.2/0.2 93.1/6.6/0.0/0.2 92.9/6.9/0.0/0.2 92.6/6.9/0.2/0.2. values in parentheses are for highest-resolution shell.

C1S1 represents the starting state 1 with a vacant active site; C1S1/2 shows evidence of initial NTP binding via base-paring. metal A still resided several ngstroms away from its catalytic position. metal B was observed within coordination-distance range of the CTP phosphates and the motif A residue D329. D329 (the first aspartate in sequence XGDD) is one of two universally conserved aspartic acid residues in polymerases following the two-metal-ion catalytic mechanism (17) postcatalysis complexes in two NACs provide the NTP Selection Details by +1 template Purine Bases. the +1 template nucleotide is poised to allow initial NTP binding (13, 18\u201320) this site allows the nascent base pair to form without establishing the stacking interactions with the 1 base pair. TP-free S1 structures were superimposed by a maximum likelihood superimposition of the polymerase molecules. the placement of the +1 template base was subjected only to very subtle movement toward the major groove side. the polymerase active site conformation is essentially identical in the two product structures. the ribose atoms of the +1 nucleotides are shown as spheres to aid the structural comparison with the alignment grids. key interactions around the ribose cluster upon active site closure are indicated by green and pink lines. the pyrophosphate, and a structurally equivalent water molecule, has not been observed in RdRP structures. a Previously unidentified translocation intermediate suggests an Asymmetric movement of template\u2013product RNA duplex. the EV71 RdRP EC lattice reported here could allow the capture of such intermediates. this is the first reported crystallography-derived polymerase EC intermediate that demonstrates the global motion of the template\u2013product duplex during translocation. it is conceptually different from the crystal structure of yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) EC in complex with -amanitin in which only the intermediate conformation of the downstream DNA is observed. stereo-pair images of all seven complexes with their polymerases superimposed. the C3S6 complex is shown in black, and the other six complexes are colored as the C1S1/2 complex. the +2 template nucleotides in all complexes are omitted for clarity. the template strand lagged behind, with its backbone phosphates at positions 2 to +1 remaining locked at their pretranslocational positions. the 7 to 4 phosphates moved upstream by less than a half-register on average. previously unidentified translocation intermediate supports asymmetric movement of the template\u2013product duplex during translocation. arrows indicate hydrogen bonding, electrostatic, or hydrophobic interactions. underlining indicates a change of interaction partner(s) for a polymerase residue when switching from the posttranslocation complex to the intermediate complex. backbone conformation for the ribose\u2013phosphate linkage of the template strand 2 nucleotide (14) together, these two interactions lock the 2 to +1 sequence in place, specifically preventing this region from moving while the remainder of the product\u2013template RNA duplex undergoes translocation in an asymmetric fashion. the energy to achieve the requisite conformational changes is likely an important contributor to the ultimate energy barrier for translocation. the current study makes important advances toward the understanding of the viral RdRP elongation NAC. the current NAC working model starts with an S1 complex in the absence of NTP substrate with an open active site. the NTP establishes its initial interaction through base-paring with the +1 template base and stacking with the 1 priming base (S1/2), leading to the rearrangement around the NTP ribose and motif A residue D238. all seven structures reported in the current study were assigned at corresponding positions in the cycle. a norovirus polymerase\u2013RNA\u2013CTP complex exhibiting a precatalysis active site represents reference state 3. the pretranslocation state could establish fast equilibrium with the S6 intermediate state. the +1G:C and +1A:U product complexes strongly support this proposal. the spatial placement of the +1 nucleotides, the edges of the +1 base pair, and the shape of the active site complementing the +1 nucleotides are highly analogous. the precise placement of the nascent NMP ribose hydroxyl groups in the two product complexes emphasizes the importance of the ribose\u2013Asp switch in substrate pyrophosphate is present with a refined occupancy of 0.55, comparable to the 0.66\u20130.72 occupancies seen in the pretranslocation structures. the release of pyrophosphate may coincide with the final upstream movement of the template 2 to +2 region. however, the release and conformational changes controlling the templates strand movement are mechanically related. e\u2013phosphate linkage is observed only in viral RdRP\u2013RNA complexes (2, 10, 14, 23) the sharp turn at the +1/+2 junction of the template strand is shared by several classes of polymerases. the helical trace of the template strand backbone must deform around the +1/+2 junction, making the postcatalysis translocation less fluid. the current study makes important advances toward the understanding of the viral RdRP elongation NAC. the current NAC working model starts with an S1 complex in the absence of NTP substrate with an open active site. after diffusing into the NTP entry channel formed between the motif F in the ring finger and motifs A and D in the palm. a norovirus polymerase\u2013RNA\u2013CTP complex represents reference state 3. the pretranslocation state could establish fast equilibrium with the S6 intermediate state. the subsequent transition to the posttranslocation state 1 of the next NAC is rate-limiting. the precise recognition of the equivalent geometry of the Watson\u2013Crick base pairs may be the most important factor in NTP selection by polymerases (36). the +1G:C and +1A:U product complexes strongly support this proposal, because the spatial placement of the +1 nucleotides, the edges of the +1 base pair, and the shape of the active site complementing the +1 nucleotides are highly analogous. the power stroke model emphasizes the correlation between pyrophosphate release and the required conformational changes controlling the templates. the postcatalysis product strand is subject to Brownian motion (fast equilibrium) between the pre- and posttranslocation states because of the evenly distributed interactions with the polymerase. this movement is likely the rate-limiting step during translocation and therefore is largely irreversible. strand movement may be a general feature of other classes of polymerases. asymmetric conformation of the template 2 ribose\u2013phosphate linkage is observed only in viral RdRP\u2013RNA complexes. the sharp turn at the +1/+2 junction is shared by several classes of polymerases. asymmetric template\u2013product conformation in these Pol II ICs appears to be different from that suggested by the translocation intermediate in the current study. more high-resolution translocation-intermediate structures are needed to refine further the understanding of the polymerase translocation in general. molecular dynamics approaches could serve as a valid tool for testing whether other classes of polymerases exhibit asymmetric RNA-strand movements during translocation. the cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C to an OD600 of 0.6. the cells were grown for an additional 11\u201312 h before harvesting. a hiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) was used in the second chromatographic purification step. the 10mer RNA primer (P10) was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. the procedures for the self-annealing of the template strand, the subsequent annealing with P10, and the r5 construct storage were described. the initial structure solution was obtained using the molecular replacement program PHASER (50) the initial structure solution was obtained using coordinates derived from the PV EC structure (PDB ID code 3OL6) as the search model (10). the 3,500-K composite simulated-annealing omit 2Fo-Fc electron density maps were generated using CNS (53) cells were grown at 25 \u00b0C overnight in LB medium with 50 g/mL kanamycin (KAN50) and 17 g/mL chloramphenicol (CHL17) until the OD600 was 1.0. overnight culture was used to inoculate 1 L of LB medium with KAN50 and CHL17 to reach an initial OD600 of 0.025. cell lysis, subsequent purification, and storage procedures were as described previously (3). the yield is typically in the range of 8\u201315 mg pure protein per liter of bacterial culture. the template strand RNA to assemble the r5 construct (14) solely used in the current study was obtained by in vitro T7 RNA polymerase transcription using a parental plasmid pRAV23. all final diffraction data for all crystals were collected at the SSRF beamline BL17U1 at 100 Kelvin. data (100\u2013150\u00b0) were typically collected in 0.5\u00b0 oscillation steps. reflections were integrated, merged, and scaled using HKL2000 or D*Trek v9.9."}
