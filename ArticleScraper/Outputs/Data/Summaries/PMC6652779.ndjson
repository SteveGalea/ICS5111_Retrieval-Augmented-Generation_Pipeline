{"summary": "leishmaniasis is the most severe form of leishmania infection, which is caused by leishmania donovani or L. infantum (3). it is a potentially life-threatening disease associated with systemic spread of parasites to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow. miR155 regulates a wide array of genes, including chemokines, cytokines, and transcription factors (11) miR155 promotes efficient antigen presentation by dendritic cells (11) and regulates members of the superfamilies of tumor necrosis factor receptors and their ligands. spleen parasite burdens in miR155KO mice peaked at 40 dpi. spleen parasite burdens in miR155KO mice peaked at 40 dpi. both groups eventually began to resolve the infection. hepatic granuloma formation is critical for parasite clearance in VL. the number of developing, mature, and parasitic free granulomas significantly increased in the livers of miR155KO mice at 120 dpi. spleen cells from miR155KO mice showed significantly reduced T cell proliferation responses at 40, 60, and 120 dpi compared to those from similarly infected WT controls. culture supernatants from miR155KO mice contained significantly higher levels of TNF- than WT mice at 15 dpi. miR155KO mice harbored significantly more parasites in their livers and spleens than WT controls. at 60, 90, and 120 dpi, livers of miR155KO mice expressed higher transcript levels of IFN-, iNOS, and TNF- (Fig. 3C) than WT counterparts. no significant differences were noted in the transcript levels of IL-10, IL-12, and IL-17 in the spleen and liver between WT and miR155KO mice. but CXCL-10 (C-X-C motif chemokine 10) was significantly elevated in both the livers and spleens of miR155KO mice at chronic stages of the infection. gene expression analysis was done by RT-PCR. lack of miR155 leads to decreased trafficking of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in various viral infections. lack of miR155 leads to decreased trafficking of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in various viral infections, like coronavirus and herpes simplex encephalitis. miR155 plays a role in mediating recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells to the visceral organs during L. donovani infection. mice were euthanized at the respective time intervals and analyzed for lymphoid and myeloid cell populations. 155KO mice also showed increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes at 60, 90, and 120 dpi compared to those of the spleens of WT mice. PD-L1 expression by the myeloid cell population plays an important role in immune regulation in various infectious diseases as well as in several cancer models. bar graph of percentage of inflammatory monocytes in total liver cells at respective time intervals. bar graph of percentage of inflammatory monocytes in total splenocytes. data represented are from 1 of the 3 independent experiments. miR155KO mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (control) antagonist RS-504393 from 15 dpi to 40 dpi to reduce accumulation of Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes in the organs. parasite loads in the organs were calculated at 40 dpi. results suggest that miR155 deficiency leads to the accumulation of Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes. spleen parasite burdens in miR155KO mice peaked at 40 dpi. at this time point, spleens of miR155KO mice contained significantly more parasites than their WT counterparts. however, both groups eventually began to resolve the infection. hepatic granuloma formation is critical for parasite clearance in VL (17) miR155KO mice contained significantly fewer developing and mature granulomas. lack of miR155 impairs both Th1 and Th2 immune responses in the spleens of L. donovani-infected mice. culture supernatants from miR155KO mice contained significantly higher levels of TNF- than those from similarly infected WT controls. at 40 dpi, culture supernatants from miR155KO mice contained significantly higher levels of TNF- than WT mice at 15 dpi. IL-4 production by spleen cells from miR155KO mice decreased significantly as infection progressed. miR155KO mice harbored significantly more parasites in their livers and spleens than WT controls. we analyzed gene transcript levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and miR155-targeted SHIP-1 and SOCS1 in the organs of L. donovani-infected mice. at 60, 90, and 120 dpi, livers of miR155KO mice expressed higher transcript levels of IFN- ( chemokine 10) was significantly elevated in both the livers and spleens of miR155KO-infected mice. gene expression analysis was done by RT-PCR. data are represented as fold induction in response to liver and spleen. miR155 deficiency leads to decreased trafficking of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in various viral infections, like coronavirus (19) and herpes simplex encephalitis (20) it also has been shown that miR155 is highly expressed on regulatory T cells and is a direct target for Foxp3 (22). miR155KO-infected mice were euthanized at the respective time intervals. spleens showed increased numbers of inflammatory monocytes at 60, 90, and 120 dpi compared to those of the spleens of miR155KO mice. miR155KO-infected mice expressed significantly higher PD-L1 mRNA transcript levels than their WT counterparts. in vitro studies showed that CD11b+ Ly6Chi cells from miR155KO mice were significantly more effective in suppressing proliferation of naive T cells upon anti-CD3 activation. these cells could contribute to high parasitic burdens in miR155KO mice by suppressing T cell responses. bar graph of percentage of inflammatory monocytes in total splenocytes at respective time intervals. data represented are from 1 of the 3 independent experiments. n = 5 mice for each group/time interval. miR155KO mice were treated with phosphate-buffered saline (control) or the chemokine receptor type 2 antagonist RS-504393. RS-504393 treatment effectively reduced the parasitic loads in both the livers and spleens of miR155KO mice. this suggests that miR155 deficiency leads to the accumulation of Ly6Chi inflammatory monocytes. miR155KO-infected mice expressed lower numbers of developing and mature granulomas than WT-infected mice at early stages of infection. this is indicative of immediate-early protection mediated by miR155KO. miR155 is known to be involved in mechanisms that lead to IFN- and TNF- production by antigen-restimulated splenocytes. the mechanisms behind IFN- production in the liver occur via miR155-independent mechanisms. the increased levels of IFN- combined with higher SHIP-1 and SOCS1 levels in infected miR155KO mice suggest that the production of IFN- in the liver during L. donovani infection is mediated. KO mice expressed higher levels of mRNA transcripts of CXCL10 and CCL2. cytokines have been shown to play an important role in monocyte migration and recruitment to the site of inflammation in leishmaniasis (36, 37) and other diseases, such as HIV (38), rheumatoid arthritis, and atherosclerosis (39, 40) all experimental mice were euthanized at 15, 40, 60, 90, and 120 days postinfection. parasitic loads were represented by leishman-Donavan units. each sample was scored as (i) no cellular response, (ii) developing granuloma. cells were stimulated for 72 h with 20 g/ml LdAg prepared by freeze-thawing L. donovani promastigote cultures. all the capture and detection antibodies were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA) total RNA was extracted from spleens and livers of experimental mice by the TRIzol extraction method. cDNAs were prepared with iScript reverse transcriptase, and reverse transcription-PCRs were performed using a CFX 96 RT-PCR cycler. suspensions were prepared from the spleens and livers of experimental mice. spleens and livers were mashed, red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer. cells were acquired through a fluorescence-activated cell sorter. a P value of 0.05 was considered significant. spleens and livers were harvested and used to make smear impressions on glass slides. slides were then fixed with methanol for 10 min, air dried, and stained with Giemsa stain for 30 min. the number of amastigotes per 1,000 nucleated cells was calculated using a microscope. supernatants were collected and production of IFN-, TNF-, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and IL-13 cytokines was analyzed. all the capture and detection antibodies were purchased from BioLegend (San Diego, CA, USA), and all the recombinant mouse cytokine standards were purchased from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA) single-cell suspensions were prepared from spleens and livers of experimental mice. spleens and livers were mashed, red blood cells were lysed with ACK lysis buffer, and single-cell suspensions were prepared. was used to determine statistical significance of differences among the groups. 0.05 was considered significant."}
