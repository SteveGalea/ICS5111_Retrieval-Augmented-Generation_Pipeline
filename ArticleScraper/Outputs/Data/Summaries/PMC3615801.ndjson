{"summary": "spatial algorithms have been developed since the late 90s to identify and locate disease outbreaks. but current well-received spatial algorithms assume only one outbreak cluster present at the same point of time which may not be valid during a pandemic. this paper suggests that time series analysis in detection of pandemics is still a desirable process. the wavelet anomaly detector algorithm is used in the realtime outbreak and disease surveillance system. it computes a score for each unit (e.g., ZIP code) area based on how many standard deviations the number of cases from that area is elevated from the expected. some other algorithms applying temporal analysis have also been explored in [5,6,7] using the Bayesian approach is the Bayesian spatial scan statistic (BSS) developed by Neill et. al. [11] it computes the posterior probability of the alternative hypothesis H1, P(H1(S)|Data), in a region S. it creates a conjugate Gamma-Poisson model to compute the posterior probability of having an outbreak. the hypothesis in this paper is that current existing spatial disease detection algorithms cannot detect outbreaks earlier than the time series algorithm. the common statistical models for spatial detection algorithms include the likelihood ratio (used in KSS and FSS) and the Bayesian posterior probability (used in BSS and RSC) both models presume that there is only one cluster of an outbreak at a time possible within the whole study region. this assumption would be violated in circumstances where a disease simultaneously spread from multiple separate geographic areas. LR ( S ) = L 1 ( S ) L 0 = ( C S B S ) C S ( C G - S B G - S ) C G - S ( C G - S ) C G - S ( C G - S ) C G = q 1 C S q 1'C G - S q 0 C G. the likelihood ratio of having an outbreak approaches 1, which means there is no difference between the non-hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis. this leads to the incorrect result of no found outbreak instead of multiple probable outbreak clusters. probability of data in Eq. (5), P(D) is computed as the sum of two components: one is the sum of the likelihood of all possible clusters multiplied by their priors P(H1(S)) and the other is the sum of the likelihood of the non-hypothesis multiplied by the prior P(H0). specific case where there are K (K 1) outbreak regions and the summed time series for each region follow a Poisson distribution with the same conjugate Gamma priors. the likelihoods of all the candidate clusters will thus result in the values, P(D|H1(S)), P(D|H1(S2)),, P(D|H1(SK)) for any P(D|H1(Si)) we are addressing the issue of lowered posterior probabilities of outbreak regions due to the violation of one-outbreak-region assumption. we are addressing the issue of lowered posterior probabilities of outbreak regions due to the violation of one-outbreak-region assumption. the NRDM system has been collecting OTC sales data from 30,000+ retail stores across the country on a daily basis since 2003. we chose the thermometer sales category as our indicator of the flu outbreak for three reasons: 1) Texas is one of the two states (the other is California) where H1N1 was confirmed and identified in the early stages. total thermometer sales in Texas collected from NRDM between 4/23/09 and 5/15/09. data prior to April 1, 2009 were used to train algorithms and estimate false alarm rates. data from April 1, 2009 to May 31, 2009 was used to evaluate the algorithms. the date of April 24, 2009 is considered to be an indicator of the onset of the H1N1 flu pandemic hitting Texas. 7 of the 14 samples contained the same virus strain as that found in California and the u.s. on the same day, the CDC announced that 7 of the 14 samples contained the same virus strain as that found in California and the u.s. we chose two false alarm rates: one false alarm per two months and one false alarm per month. the false alarm rate reflects how often an alarm is triggered by chance. both models presume that there is only one cluster of an outbreak at a time possible within the whole study region. probability ratio (LR(S)) is the most significant in the randomization test. the cluster S is likely to have LR(S) 1 given q\u20321 q0 and q1 q0. the likelihood ratio of having an outbreak approaches 1. q1 and q0 are much higher than baseline values. q1 and q0 are much higher than baseline values. P(H1(S)) is the prior probability of having an outbreak in any region S. based on a Gamma-Poisson model, we estimated P(H1(S) = P1/M. we will focus on the computation of the likelihood P(D|H1(S)) since P ( H 1 ( S ) ) P ( D ) is a constant across any cluster in Eq. (3). consider a specific case where there are K (K 1) outbreak regions and the summed time series for each region follow a Poisson distribution with the same conjugate Gamma priors. we are addressing the issue of lowered posterior probabilities of outbreak regions due to the violation of one-outbreak-region assumption. we are addressing the issue of lowered posterior probabilities of outbreak regions due to the violation of one-outbreak-region assumption. the goal for these two algorithms in this study is to find emerging clusters of geographic areas having significantly increased thermometer sales. we used routinely collected over-the-counter (OTC) sales data as the data source for detection of flu outbreaks. we found a strong correlation between patients with constitutional syndrome visiting emergency departments (EDs) and OTC thermometer sales in Pennsylvania in the past flu seasons. a prospective analysis was mimicked by incrementally adding each day\u2019s data to the algorithms as during the evaluation period. the date of outbreak onset shows the accumulation of confirmed H1N1 cases in Texas after April 23, 2009. the virus spread quickly and infected more than 500 people in Texas. the date of April 24, 2009 is considered to be an indicator of the onset of the H1N1 flu pandemic hitting Texas. the baseline (expected count) for each ZIP code was estimated using a wavelet transform from the previous two years of data. the cluster with the highest posterior probability is reported if it exceeds a threshold, which is estimated based on a preset false alarm rate described in the subsection of Study Dataset. the same ZIP codes in the counties Nueces, Travis, Bexar, Collin, Dallas and later El Paso, Bowie, Tarrant and Cameron repeatedly reported significantly elevated thermometer sales within those days. these results suggest that WAD was able to detect the significant increase on April 27, 2009, by identifying 66 ZIP code areas in about 20 counties showing a significantly elevated amount of thermometer purchases. orange bars represent the numbers of elevated ZIP codes with scores equal to or larger than the threshold score, which allows only one Fig. 7 shows that the cluster had become more localized and moved to the southeast. however, during the first 6 days of the real outbreak, from April 24, 2009 to April 29, 2009, BSS did not identify any significant cluster. after May 1, a 3 ZIP code cluster was found but was believed to be a false alarm. time series algorithms are less robust on noisy data (e.g., caused by imperfect data collection process, etc.) because they signal alarms whenever the deviation of the observed counts from the expected counts in an area exceeds a threshold. a secondary analysis is recommended to be performed. the comparison in this study was only performed between one spatial algorithm and one time series algorithm. this study only used one known H1N1 pandemic to test the performance of the two algorithms; therefore confidence interval for timeliness is not available."}
