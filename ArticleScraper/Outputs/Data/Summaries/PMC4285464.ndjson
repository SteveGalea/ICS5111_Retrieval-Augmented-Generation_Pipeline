{"summary": "animal studies were carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986 and the Codes of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals used in Scientific Procedures 1989. all animals were surgically implanted intraperitoneally with a Remo 200 device (Remo Technologies Ltd, Salisbury, UK) the frozen stock of B. pseudomallei was recovered on to LB-agar plates with 5% glycerol (LBG) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. then incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm for 24 h. suspension was serially diluted to the appropriate concentration. s were subcultured onto LB-agar plates for B. pseudomallei or LBG for B. mallei and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 24 or 48 h respectively. Counts are expressed as cfu/g of tissue or cfu/ml of blood. sections were dewaxed, rehydrated and then treated in hydrogen peroxide 3% (v/v) the tissue sections were then pretreated for antigen retrieval by either enzymatic digestion with pronase XIV (0.05% w/v pronase XIV 5.2 U/mg; Sigma 9.c) the sections were then microwaved in citric acid buffer (2.1 g citric acid; Fisher Scientific, Loughborough, Leicestershire, UK) the sections were incubated for 30 min at room temperature with ABC. the signal was detected using 3,30-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (DAB) the sections were lightly counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin (Surgipath, Peterborough, UK) for 5 min. Bacterial capsular antigen was detected using a B. pseudomallei antibody (3VIE5) that has shown cross-reactivity with B. mallei. controls included sequential sections with an isotype control for each primary antibody. all animals were surgically implanted intraperitoneally with a Remo 200 device (Remo Technologies Ltd, Salisbury, UK) to record core body temperature (Tc) data were transmitted from the devices at 30 s intervals to local placed antennas and relayed to receivers. the frozen stock of B. mallei was recovered on to LB-agar plates with 5% glycerol (LBG) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h before inoculation into nutrient broth. then further incubated at 37 \u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm for 24 h. Thin sections (4 m) were cut and stained with haematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for histopathological analysis. a scoring system was established to allow semi-quantitative comparison. sections were then microwaved in citric acid buffer (2.1 g citric acid) for 18 min at 100 \u00b0C, 90% effect (780 W) or microwaved in dako high pH 9.0 buffer for 10 min. primary antibody cross-reactivity with tissue constituents was prevented using 1.5% normal serum block applied to the sections for 20 min. the sections were lightly counterstained with Mayer's haematoxylin (Surgipath, Peterborough, UK) for 5 min, dehydrated in absolute alcohol and cleared in xylene before being coverslipped. IHC techniques for cell markers applied in this study have been successfully used in multiple species tissue samples. all the techniques were performed in a GLP, ISO9001:2008 and ISO 17025 compliant laboratory facility. haematology, clinical chemistry and electrolytes Blood was collected from all animals at post-mortem into blood tubes, anti-coagulated with either EDTA or Lithium heparin. mixed-sex pairs of animals were challenged with between 26 and 1.7 103 cfu of B. pseudomallei or 7 and 1.2 104 cfu of B. mallei by the subcutaneous route in a stepwise approach. following challenge with B. pseudomallei, animals became febrile between 2 and 4.5 days p.c. depending on the dose received and were humanely euthanised between 5.9 and 10.6 days p.c. 1.2 104 7.9 5.9 2 1.2 102 85 (3.5)

cfu of burkholderia mallei by the subcutaneous route. levels of ALKP and AST generally increased with time while levels of ALT peaked around 24\u201348 h p.c. indicating liver dysfunction. mixed-sex pairs of animals were challenged with 1.2 108 cfu of B. pseudomallei or 5.3 107 cfu of B. mallei. a gradual increase in temperature was observed between 2.5 and 5 h postchallenge (p.c.) remaining high until the animals were humanely euthanised at 22 and 27 h p.c. for both B. mallei and B. pseudomallei, there was a statistically significant relationship between the challenge dose and the survival of the animals using a general linear model. the two pathogens were statistically different from each other (P 0.0001). the time to onset of fever was 34.4 1.3 h, with a subsequent duration of 35.2 2.6 h, prior to a rapid decline indicative of the animal reaching the humane endpoint. in all cases, bacteraemia was observed (range of 2.4 104 to 4.9 106 cfu/ml, median of 1.5 105 cfu/ml), and high concentrations of bacteria were recovered from all organs assessed. 97 102 56 cfu of B pseudomallei or 3.65 102 105 cfu of burkholderia mallei reached the humane endpoint at 8.9 0.6 days. at a challenge dose of 3.13 102 138 cfu of B. mallei, the time to onset of fever was 46 4 h, with a subsequent duration of 165 13 h. a challenge dose of approximately 1 102 cfu was therefore selected as a reproducible dose for both pathogens. the challenge dose was then used as a target dose for subsequent pathogenesis studies. two pairs of animals were humanely euthanised at 12, 24, 36 and 48 h p.c. significantly higher concentrations of bacteria were observed in the liver (P = 0.004), spleen (P = 0.003), kidney (P = 0.002), lung (P = 0.003), brain (P = 0.002) and blood (P = 0.002) at 48 h

appearance. the first evidence of microscopic lesions was observed in the liver and spleens of 75% of animals. pathological features were observed in the lungs; 83% of lungs exhibited no pathological features. the remaining 17% exhibited multifocal necrotising pneumonia. 3.5 3.75 3.5 1.75 0.5 1.25 2.25 1.75 4 2.5 0.5 1 1 1 0.75 0.25 0 0.25 T 0 ND ND 3.0 ND ND ND 3.0 ND ND ND 3.0 ND ND ND 3.0 ND ND

increase in the number of white blood cells (WBC) was observed with time, decreasing in terminal animals. a similar trend was observed with the monocyte levels. Lymphopenia was associated with neutrophilia, followed by a decrease in the numbers of neutrophils. bacterial cells spread from the injection site to the liver, spleen and lung by 24 h p.c. by 72 h p.c., the number of bacterial cells in the liver had increased from 5.9 102 cfu to 6 103 cfu per gram. at this time, low numbers of bacterial cells were recovered from the kidney and brain. marmosets challenged with 1.79 102 20 cfu of burkholderia mallei. one animal exhibited spontaneous pustular eruptions of the face. each time point represents data from four different animals humanely euthanised at that time. lesions in the lungs ranged from non-necrotic, multifocal solid lesions in one animal to a multifocal lesion with severe necrosis in the other animal. the lesions were associated with the presence of bacterial antigen, macrophages (Figure8c), T cells (Figure8d) and iNOS expressing cells. lesion characterisation including associated bacterial antigen and cell types identified in various organs of marmosets challenged with burkholderia mallei mallei by the subcutaneous route Time (h) representative H&E and IHC stained tissue sections from the lungs of a marmoset humanely euthanised at 144 h p.c. challenged with 1.79 102 20 cfu of burkholderia mallei by the subcutaneous route. the most severe pathological features in marmosets following subcutaneous challenge with B. pseudomallei were present in the spleen and liver. the most severe pathological features in marmosets following subcutaneous challenge with B. mallei were present in the spleen and liver. multiifocal necrotising pneumonia was observed in all animals following challenge with B. pseudomallei. this is highly suggestive of a completely different disease pathogenesis. pyogranulomatous inflammation was evident in the liver, spleen and lymph nodes. melioidosis varies from acute sepsis with fever, bacteraemia and primary or secondary pneumonia to chronic localised infection associated with abscesses and ulcerations, to latent infection. the most prevalent natural route of exposure is believed to be inoculation through cuts or skin abrasions. the subcutaneous route of challenge was used in the marmosets to mimic systemic disease. in humans, primary cutaneous melioidosis results in a localised infection causing single lesions ranging from ulcers to boils, pustules or even erythematous lesions. bacteraemia is a common complication of primary cutaneous melioidosis. marmoset models of glanders and melioidosis are reproducibly lethal at selected challenge doses. the time to the onset of clinical disease in humans is variable, ranging from 24 h to 62 years. in the marmosets, particularly melioidosis, the marmoset models acute, lethal disease that would serve as a stringent model for the medical countermeasure. the marmoset has been previously used to assess medical countermeasures; a vaccine has been tested for Lassa fever (Lukashevicha et al. 2008) and the efficacy of ciprofloxacin has been determined as postexposure therapies for anthrax and"}
