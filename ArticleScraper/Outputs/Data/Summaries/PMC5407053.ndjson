{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) chimeric Jc1 virus was generated in the human hepatoma cell line (Huh7.5) as previously described. the African lineage ZIKV strain (MP1751), isolated in Uganda in 1962, was propagated by using vero-B4 cells like MERS-CoV strain EMC. TCID50 of 2 individual experiments was also calculated using GraphPad Prism. significance of differences in mean EC50 obtained for the viruses was tested using 2-tailed Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank test (P.01) ations at which the formulations reached the half maximum virus inactivation effective concentration (EC50) were determined using nonlinear regression using the robust fitting method. the mean TCID50 of 2 individual experiments and standard deviation of means were also calculated using GraphPad Prism. a concentration of only 30% was required for complete inactivation with WHO forumulation II. the biocide concentrations ranged from 0% to 80% with an exposure time of 30 seconds. the biocide concentrations ranged from 0% to 80%. a 30% concentration was sufficient to completely inactivate BCoV, whereas for WHO formulation I higher concentrations of at least 40% were required. similar inactivation profiles could be observed for MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, demonstrating a high susceptibility of emerging CoVs to WHO formulations. MVA was studied for its susceptibility to WHO formulations. similar inactivation profiles could be observed with increasing WHO formulation I and II concentrations. the most susceptible viruses to the WHO formulation I were the bovine and emerging CoVs (BCoV, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV) and ZIKV (Figure 2C) the more stable viruses included the full infectious EBOV (trVLPs excluded in this analysis) the highest alcohol-based concentrations of WHO formulation I (>40%) were required for H1N1 and MVA. dal Activity of World Health Organization Formulations Against Hepatitis C Virus and Zika Virus Hepatitis C virus and ZIKV both belong to the family of Flaviviridae. transmission of ZIKV occurs mainly through mosquitos, with the most important and common vectors being the Aedes genus. cytotoxicity was determined by a limiting dilution assay. the cytotoxicity was calculated in analogy to the determination of virus titer. the means of 2 independent experiments with standard deviations are shown. a Virus, human Influenza A Virus, and Modified Vaccinia Ankara Strain Work with infectious EBOV is restricted to biosafety level 4 laboratories. inactivation of these transcription- and replication-competent virus-like particles (trVLPs) with WHO formulations showed a dose-dependent reduction of trVLP reporter activity with increasing WHO formulation I and II concentrations. the biocide concentrations ranged from 0% to 80% with an exposure time of 30 seconds. for this inactivation assay, 1 part virus and 1 part organic load were mixed with 8 parts of biocide. for EBOV, residual infectivity was determined by a limiting dilution assay. the highest alcohol-based concentrations of WHO formulation I (>40%) were required for H1N1 and MVA. the results for the isopropanol-based WHO formulation II are depicted in Figure 2D. the results for the isopropanol-based WHO formulation II are depicted in Figure 2D. a recent study by M\u00fcller et al reported that ZIKV was inactivated by classical inactivation methods including ultraviolet light. the findings are supported by earlier analyses of the environmental stability and inactivation profiles of HCV, which showed strong virucidal effects of the main WHO formulation ingredients ethanol and isopropanol. resistance to both WHO formulations was observed, probably due to the more hydrophilic character of these nonenveloped viruses. a strong virucidal effect against emerging pathogens, including ZIKV, EBOV, SARS-CoV, and MERS-CoV, could be demonstrated.
