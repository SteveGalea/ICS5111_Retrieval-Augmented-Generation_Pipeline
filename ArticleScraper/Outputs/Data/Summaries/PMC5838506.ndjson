{"summary": "mathematical models for differential equations have been widely applied in various fields [1\u20137]. Specifically, they have had a realistic significance to analyze the dynamical behaviors in the field of mathematical biology [8\u201317], which obtained some novel results. t ) + Q ( t ) + R ( t ) + R ( t ) is the inflow rate corresponding to birth and immigration. the contact rate Q / N with the quarantined fraction Q / N does not occur. there is the transmission coefficient between susceptible individuals and infected individuals. this paper considers an SEIQR (susceptible-exposed-infected-quarantined-recovered) epidemic model with imperfect vaccination. p (0 p 1) is the vaccine efficacy, and is the rate at which exposed individuals become infected individuals. system (3) has a unique globally asymptotically stable positive equilibrium E = (S, E, I, Q, R) in the region D. that means the epidemic diseases will die out and the total individuals will become the susceptible and recovered individuals. deterministic model is not enough to describe species activities. d B 1 t, d E = 1 S I N Q + 1 p S I N Q + E d t + 2 E d B 2 t, d I = E + 1 + + I d t + 3 I d B 3 t, d Q = I + 2 + Q d t + 4 Q d B 4 t, d R = p S + I + Q R d t + 5 R d B 5 t, system (5) has a unique positive local solution (S(t), E(t), I(t), Q(t), R(t)) for any given initial value (S(0), E(0), I(0), Q(0), R(0)) R+5 on t 0 a.s. proof \u2014 The following proof is divided into two parts. k = inf t, e: S t 1 k, k, E t 1 k, k, I t 1 k, k, Q t 1 k, k or R t 1 k, k, k, (6) where we define inf = ( represents the empty set) k is strictly increasing when k. 3 I 1 d B 3 t + 4 Q 1 d B 4 t + 5 R 1 d B 5 t, (9) where L V = 1 1 S 1 S I N Q 1 p S I N Q p + S + 1 1 E 1 S I N Q + E + 1 1 I E + 1 + + I + 1 1 Q I + 2 + Q + 1 1 R p S + I + Q R + 1 2 1 2 + 2 2 + 3 2 + 4 2 + 5 d V M 0 d t + 1 S 1 d B 1 t + 2 E 1 d B 2 t + 3 I 1 d B 3 t + 4 Q 1 d B 4 t + 5 R 1 d B 5 t. we have E V S k T, E k T, I k T, Q k T, R k T V S 0, E 0, I 0, Q 0, R 0 + E 0 k T M 0 one has V S 0, E 0, I 0, Q 0, R 0 + M 0 T E 1 k V S k, E k, I k, Q k, R k, 1 k 1 ln 1 k k 1 ln k, (14) and here 1k() is the indicator function of k(). lim t 1 t 0 t S r d B 1 r = 0, lim t 1 t 0 t Q r d B 4 r = 0, lim t 1 t 0 t Q r d B 5 r = 0 a.s. proof \u2014 The proof of Lemma 3 is similar to [25, 41]. lim t S = p + = S 0, lim t R = p p + = R 0 a.s.

(26) from the fourth equation of system (5), it is easy to get that l i m t Q t = 0 a.s. (26) and dividing by t on both sides of the first equation of system (5) yield S t S 0 t = 1 p S I N Q p + S + 1 t 0 t S r d B 1 r, the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion matrix A ( x) is bounded away from zero. in the domain U and some neighborhood thereof, the smallest eigenvalue of the diffusion matrix A ( x) is bounded away from zero. j Z 2, x H, R n.
