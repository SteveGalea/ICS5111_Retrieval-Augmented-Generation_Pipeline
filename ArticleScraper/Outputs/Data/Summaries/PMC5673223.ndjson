{"summary": "influenza pandemics had occurred in the 20th century: 1918 Spanish flu, 1957\u20131958 Asian influenza and 1968 Hong Kong influenza. one recently occurred in the 21st century: 2009 pandemic H1N1. seasonal epidemics of influenza are also of great concern, as it causes approximately 3\u20135 million of severe illness. flu virus initiates infection at the respiratory tract mucosal surface. it would be advantageous to have a vaccine that is able to induce mucosal immune response, mainly the secretory IgA (sIgA) lactis is widely recognized as safe bacterium. elicited upon oral immunization of the non-recombinant L. lactis surface displaying HA1 (LL-HA1/L/AcmA) in mice. protective efficacy of LL-HA1/L/AcmA against a lethal dose challenge with influenza virus was also assessed. centrifugation was performed to improve the binding of HA1/L/AcmA to L. lactis. cell pellet was eventually resuspended in 200 l of PBS. the cells were eventually suspended in 1 ml of PBS. a total of 5104 cells fell into the gate defined on the forward angle light scatter-side angle light scatter plot were acquired. a total of 5104 cells falling into the gate defined on the forward angle light scatter-side angle light scatter plot were acquired to determine the positive cell count and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) mice (n = 8) were immunized orally with 0.1 ml of 51010 CFU of LL-HA1/L/AcmA (125 g/dosage), HA1/L/AcmA (125 g/dosage) or endotoxin-free PBS for 3 consecutive days. the immunization regimen was repeated thrice at 2 weeks intervals. small intestine was harvested and flushed thrice with 1 ml PBS containing 1 mM PMSF. the sample from small intestine was then obtained following centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min. mouse trachea was cannulated with an intravenous catheter. gated goat anti-mouse IgG (Abcam, UK) at 1:10,000 dilution or HRP-conjugated rat anti-mouse IgA (Abcam, UK) at 1:1,000 dilution. the plates were washed 3 times with PBS between steps. ketamine-xylazine (ketamine: 80\u2013120 mg/kg; xylazine: 10\u201316 mg/kg) was used to anesthetize the animals in this study. an overdose of ketamine-xylazine was given to euthanize the animals in this study. a total of 5104 cells fell into the gate defined on the forward angle light scatter-side angle light scatter plot were acquired to determine the positive cell count and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) a total of 5104 cells falling into the gate defined on the forward angle light scatter-side angle light scatter plot were acquired to determine the positive cell count. L. lactis displaying HA1/L/AcmA was resuspended in endotoxin-free PBS. the constructed non-recombinant L. lactis was named LL-HA1/L/AcmA. mice were housed in specific-pathogen-free conditions with free access to food and water. the immunization regimen was repeated thrice at 2 weeks intervals. as a positive control, HA1/L/AcmA (50 g/dosage) emulsified with complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. mouse trachea was cannulated with an intravenous catheter (BD Bioscience, USA) and connected to a syringe. BAL fluid obtained by flushing the lungs with 1 ml cold PBS for 5 times. lavage fluid recovered from two washings was pooled. all mice in study group B were fully anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine. after inoculation, body weight and survival rate of the mice were monitored daily up to 14 days. no adverse reactions or mortality occurred outside of the humane endpoint was observed throughout the study. the percentage of Alexa Fluor 488-positive gated cells reached plateau when 20 g of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein was added. the results suggested that the optimum amount of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein to be incubated with 1\u20133109 CFU was 20 g. protein in GM17 for 1 h, 2 h, 3 h, and 4 h was examined. incubation for 2 h was optimum for surface display of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein. binding of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein started to dissociate. HA1/L/AcmA-specific serum IgG and IgA were measured as the main readout for systemic immunity. there were no differences in the serum IgG (Fig 2A) and IgA (Fig 2B) in mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA. HA1/L/AcmA-specific sIgA in faecal extract, small intestine wash, BAL fluid and nasal fluid were measured as main readout of mucosal immunity. no statistical difference between mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA (mean OD: 0.620.09) and the PBS-treated group. mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA developed a significantly higher HA1/L/AcmA-specific sIgA in nasal fluid (p0.05) compared to PBS-treated group (mean OD: 0.140.02) mice were immunized orally with a five-fold higher dose of LL-HA1/L/AcmA. one significant outlier was detected in the data set for serum IgA of mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA using Grubbs\u2019 test. another significant outlier was detected in the data set for serum IgG of mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA using Grubbs\u2019 test. orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA or HA1/L/AcmA or subcutaneously (SC) immunized with HA1/L/AcmA-FA. no significant difference in the detected HA1/L/AcmA-specific sIgA. gA in faecal sample suggests HA1/L/AcmA without L. lactis as a carrier did not stimulate significant level of sIgA in the faecal sample. the same was noted for mice immunized subcutaneously with HA1/L/AcmA-FA as compared to PBS-treated group. mice in LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated and HA1/L/AcmA-treated group decreased until day 6 and 7 p.i. a lower rate of body weight loss was observed in LL-HA1/L/AcmA-treated (-0.30.1) and HA1/L/AcmA-treated group (-0.60.1), respectively. oral immunization of LL-HA1/L/AcmA is superior in reducing morbidity upon exposure to influenza virus compared to the HA1/L/AcmA without L. lactis as a carrier. at 18 days following the last immunization, all mice in study group B were intranasally challenged with 10 LD50 of H1N1/A/TN/1-560/2009-MA2 virus. 0.0 0.20.0 1.50.7 *** 8/8 (100) *** >14.0 a), b) Rate of body weight loss and body weight recovery was calculated by linear regression analysis. data are presented as mean standard deviation. ization of mice with LL-HA1/L/AcmA or HA1/L/AcmA provided protection to the animals against a lethal challenge with influenza virus. optimization of binding of HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein to L. lactis was immunofluorescence-labeled with Alexa Fluor 488. the percentage and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) value of L. lactis surface displaying HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein after incubation with HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein in GM17 and PBS. the data represents mean standard deviation. the MFI value obtained for HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein binding in GM17 was significantly higher in comparison to PBS. this suggested that more recombinant proteins were bound per L. lactis cells in GM17 and hence, was a better binding buffer. HA1/L/AcmA-specific (A) IgG and (B) IgA in serum at 1:10 dilution were determined, in addition to HA1/L/AcmA-specific IgA in (C) faecal sample (1:5 dilution), (D) small intestine wash (neat), (E) BAL fluid (neat) and (F) nasal fluid (neat) of mice immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA (mean OD: 0.620.09) was detected to be significantly higher (p0.05) than PBS-treated group (mean OD: 0.400.05) one significant outlier was detected using Grubbs\u2019 test (p0.05) in each of these groups and were excluded in the statistical analysis. there were no significant differences in the HA1/L/AcmA-specific serum IgG (Fig 3A) and serum IgA (Fig 3B) for mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA. the same was observed for mice orally immunized with HA1/L/AcmA recombinant protein only. subcutaneous immunization of HA1/L/AcmA-FA in mice stimulated good serological immune responses. HA1/L/AcmA-specific serum IgG, serum IgA and faecal IgA detected by ELISA. HA1/L/AcmA-specific sIgA in faecal sample of mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA was also higher, but not statistically different compared to mice immunized with HA1/L/AcmA orally. HA1/L/AcmA without L. lactis as a carrier did not stimulate significant level of sIgA in the faecal sample all non-immunized mice were susceptible to influenza infection. sickness such as decreased activity and huddling by day 3 post-infection (p.i.) the rate of body weight loss calculated by linear regression analysis was -2.70.1. mice orally immunized with LL-HA1/L/AcmA or HA1/L/AcmA resulted in significantly less morbidity upon exposure to influenza virus. subcutaneous immunization of HA1/L/AcmA-FA in mice did not result in any morbidity upon exposure to virus.
