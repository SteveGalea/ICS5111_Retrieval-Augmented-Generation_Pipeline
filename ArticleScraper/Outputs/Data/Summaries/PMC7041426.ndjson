{"summary": "the influenza AH1N1 2009 pandemic showed that obesity is a risk factor for the severity of ALRIs in adults (7, 8) pediatric obesity has also been described as a risk factor for lower respiratory tract infections, as well as the severity and morbidity of these infections. the membrane composition has also revealed an increase in cholesterol content as has the cholesterol to phospholipid molar ratio. both have been positively correlated with a decrease in membrane fluidity, body-mass index, and plasma cholesterol levels. a cross-sectional study was conducted for 2 consecutive epidemic periods (from May to August) in 2016 and 2017. of 37 weeks, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, previous mechanical ventilation, congenital heart disease, respiratory infection during the previous 2 weeks. children with negative samples for respiratory viruses were excluded from the study. NS was determined by z-scores according to their nutritional status. Viral analysis Viral RNA and DNA were simultaneously extracted from 150 L of the NPA samples using the Viral RNA isolation kit NucleoSpin. qRT-PCR was performed using the TakyonTM Rox Probe MasterMix dTTP blue kit (Eurogentec, USA) amplification of known plasmid copy numbers of the pGEM-T DNA (Promega) containing primer targets. amplification of known plasmid copy numbers of the pGEM-T DNA (Promega) containing primer targets. multivariate Poisson regression models were used to determine factors that predict severity of infection. the relative risk for increased length of stay and oxygen therapy was calculated by taking the estimated Poisson regression coefficient () for each variable and transforming it by e [exp*confidence interval] of each independent variable for the model. all analyses were performed with Stata 14.1 software (Statacorp, Texas, USA) weight-for-age z-scores, length or height-for-age z-scores, and weight-for-height z-scores. undernourished children and those with nutritional risk were defined with a weight-for-age z-score and weight-for-height z-score of 1 SD. viral co-infection was defined as the presence of two or more viruses detected in the same respiratory sample. qRT-PCR was performed using the Viral RNA isolation kit NucleoSpin. multivariate Poisson regression models were used to determine factors that predict severity of infection (length of stay and duration of oxygen therapy) multicollinearity analyses among independent variables were performed. all analyses were performed with Stata 14.1 software (Statacorp, Texas, USA) overnutrition Is Associated With High Frequency of Viral Coinfection and Low Viral Load of RSV A total of 160 children were screened. 124 patients were eligible for this study. 63 (50.8%) patients tested positive for a single respiratory virus. another 61 patients (49.2%) tested positive for more than one respiratory virus. most viruses were found in coinfection (Figure 1). the effect of obesity and overweight conditions on the RSV load was assessed in 46 infants (10 obese, 14 overweight, and 22 normal weight) the median of RSV loads in obese infants was 5.91 log10 copies/mL (min: 3.22 log10 copies/mL and max: 7.86 log10 copies/mL) and 6.49 log10 copies/mL (min: 3.71 log10 copies/mL and max: 9.17 log10 copies/mL) obesity and overweight conditions are significantly associated with the severity of viral respiratory infections in very young children. both obesity and overweight conditions are associated with the severity of viral respiratory infections in very young children. e; OW, overweight; NW, normal weight. *, ** refer to significant levels at 5% and 1%. N = 121. we found a higher plasma leptin level in obese children 6 months than normal weight children 6 months. the values were analyzed by the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. p 0.05 was significant. 63 (50.8%) patients tested positive for a single respiratory virus. another 61 patients (49.2%) tested positive for more than one respiratory virus. most viruses were found in coinfection (Figure 1). overweight infants showed a greater frequency of coinfection (obese 71% and overweight 68%) than those with normal weights (37%) no significant differences were found between overweight and obese infants (p = 0.839). overweight infants had a median of 8.06 log10 copies/mL (min: 4.15 log10 copies/mL and max: 9.17 log10 copies/mL) difference between obese and obese infants compared to those with normal weights was significant (obese p = 0.0205 and overweight p = 0.0212, respectively) no correlation was found between overweight and obese infants (p = 0.6395) obesity and overweight conditions are significantly associated with the severity of viral respiratory infections in very young children. Table 2. Poisson multiple regression assessing the association of length of stay and nutritional status. in children under 6 months of age, children with obesity have higher plasma leptin levels than children with normal weight. we found a higher plasma leptin level in obese children 6 months than normal weight children 6 months. in children 6 months, plasma leptin level of obese patients was higher than normal weight patients. the values were analyzed by the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test. p 0.05 was significant. leptin induces SOCS3 overexpression which leads to reduced type I IFN production in obese patients. downstream in the route of type I IFNs, the antiviral 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) gene is also activated via JAK-STAT. some studies have related leptin level with hepatitis virus infection. overweight has 39% prevalence and obesity has 29%. 51% of women in reproductive age have a state of overnutrition. this could have an impact on the severity of viral infections. an inadequate immune response may also allow a greater entry of these pathogens. the increase in coinfection related to obesity and overweight conditions may have additional health effects. asthma in children between 6 and 8 years old is more frequent and severe. pathophysiology of viral coinfection as it relates to nutritional status as well as to explore the epithelial-specific response to respiratory viruses in primary cells of lean and obese child.
