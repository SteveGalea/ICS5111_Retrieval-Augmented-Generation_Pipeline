{"summary": "CUB is intended as the non-random usage of synonymous codons in the protein translation process. it is expected to significantly influence molecular genome evolution. a large number of different biological factors are correlated with the choice of optimal codons. genomes of Crassostrea gigas and Pinctada fucata have been neglected for a long time. the only study performed so far on codon usage in Bivalvia was based on ESTs generated by Sanger sequencing and targeted a single species, the Pacific oyster C. gigas. two bivalve mollusk species with a fully sequenced genome (C. gigas and P. fucata) and 62 other species whose transcriptome has been sequenced using next generation sequencing technologies. the latter were chosen due to higher throughput and lower rate of sequencing errors. the 454 Life Sciences sequences were used for bathymodiolus azoricus, Geukensia demissa, Laternula elliptica, Mimachlamys nobilis, Pinctada maxima, Tegillarc. the sequences were used for bathymodiolus azoricus, Geukensia demissa, Laternula elliptica, Mimachlamys nobilis, Pincta predicted CDS from fully sequenced genomes of C. gigas and P. fucata were retrieved from http://oysterdb.cn and http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/pinctada_fucata. de novo transcriptome assemblies were performed for all the other 62 bivalve species with the CLC Genomics Workbench. all species had to display at least 25% of the sequences included in the dataset of evolutionarily conserved genes, with an average length >500 nucleotides. a number of additional transcriptomes derived from publicly available data did not meet such criteria. RNA-seq mapping tool included in the CLC Genomics Workbench 8.5 (Aarhus, Denmark) setting length and similarity fraction parameters to 0.75 and 0.98 and insertion/deletion/mismatch penalties to 3. orthologous genes were used for CAI calculation in other species. 454 Life Sciences and Illumina-generated sequencing reads were available for a same species. the latter were chosen due to higher throughput and lower rate of sequencing errors. the 454 Life Sciences sequences were used for bathymodiolus azoricus, Geukensia demissa, Laternula elliptica, Mimachlamys nobilis, Pinctada maxima, Saccostrea glomerata, and Tegillarca granosa. details about the data were provided in Table S1. de novo transcriptome assemblies were performed for all the other 62 bivalve species with the CLC Genomics Workbench (v.7.5, CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark) in all transcriptomes, longer than 100 codons were predicted with TransDecoder (http://transdecoder.sourceforge.net) additional transcriptomes derived from publicly available data did not meet such criteria and were therefore not included in our analyses. RSCU values for each individual codon were calculated for each species. the effective number of codons (ENC) for each species was calculated according to Wright (1990) using the EMBOSS chips tool. the gene expression levels of M. galloprovincialis transcripts were calculated using the digestive gland (SRA:SRX126945-8), gills (SRA:SRX389466) and hemocytes (SRA:SRX389338) RNA-seq libraries (Gerdol et al., 2014; Moreira et al., 2015). Scatter plots were generated between ENC and the average GC content calculated at the third codon position mytilus galloprovincialis (A and D), Crassostrea gigas (B) and Elliptio complanata (C) arenaria Imparidentia Galeommatoidea 56.80 Mya arenaria Imparidentia Myidae 56.80 Mya arenaria Imparidentia Myidae 56.80 Mya arenaria Imparidentia Myidae 56.80 chama anomioides Anomalodesmata Cleidothaeridae 56.52 Placopecten magellanicus Pteriomorphia Pectinida 56.44 Mizuhopecten yessoensis Pteriomorphia Pectinida 56.25 Azumapecten farreri Pteriomorphia Pectinida 56.10 Ennucula tenuis Proto Ostrea edulis Pteriomorphia Ostreoidea 54.71 Ostrea chilensis Pteriomorphia Ostreoidea 54.70 Saccostrea glomerata Pteriomorphia Ostreoidea 54.46 Astarte sulcata Archiheterodonta Crassatelloidea 53.95 Pinctada martensi Pteriomorphia Pterioidea 53.89 Corbicul meretrix meretrix Imparidentia Venerida 51.50 Lamychaena hians Imparidentia Gastrochaenidae 51.07 Sphaerium nucleus Imparidentia Sphaeriidae 51.01 Mercenaria campechiensis Imparidentia Venerida 50.98 Cerastoderma edule Imparidentia Venerida 50.98 Ruditapes decu Species clustering based on CUB does not reflect the evolutionary history of Bivalvia We computed RSCU values for the 59 informative codons of each species to perform a hierarchical clustering of species with Cluster 3. the resulting dendrogram is shown in Fig. 2. the dendrogram was inferred with Cluster 3 by hierarchical clustering. effective number of codons (ENC) and GC3 metric for each species are also displayed. group I-a comprises all the Pectinida and Ostreoidea species (Pteriomorphia), two Anomalodesmata (M. anomiodes and L. elliptica), two Protobranchia (E. tenuis and S. velum) and the Imparidentia G. turtoni, M. arenaria and S. constricta. /T ending codons in Bivalvia are the most commonly used codon(s) for each amino acid. the RSCU values of ACA (Thr), AGA and AGT (Arg), TCA (Ser), TGT (Cys), CCA (Pro), GCT (Ala) and Gly are always lower than 1, indicating that these codons are avoided in all species. species CUB (negative ENC); NS, non-significant correlation, based on F-test of linear regression. this correlation is significant for most codons with, once again, the exception of the C-starting codons encoding the six-fold degenerate amino acids Leu and Arg. sENC-x values of all amino acids negatively correlate with ENC with significant p-values, including those with relatively low average s-ENCx values. Arg is certainly the amino acid which accounts for the greatest CUB in bivalves. s-ENCx values are plotted on the Y axis and represent a measure of synonymous codon usage bias. sENC-x values are plotted on the Y axis and represent the relative intensity of CUB for each amino acid in each species. in bivalves, average GC3 appears to be tightly related to ENC. GC3 can assume values as low as 23 in M. chinensis. in bivalves, average GC3 appears to be tightly related to ENC. the p-value of the F-test of linear regression is 2.86 1036. the fully sequenced genomes of P. fucata and C. gigas possess a relatively low G/C composition. partial data from A. farreri and M. galloprovincialis indicate a similar GC content for these two species. the correlation between gene expression and CUB is not universally applicable. natural selection also potentially shapes codon usage to improve translational accuracy. a positive correlation between CUB and protein length has only been observed in bacteria. correlation between GC3 and gene expression and between GC3 and protein length seems to contradict the mutational bias given by the A/T-rich nature of the oyster genome. this observation matches the results obtained in a previous work conducted with limited expression data based on Sanger EST sequencing. the selection for translational accuracy provides a contribution to the selection of G/C-ending codons in oyster. correlation between GC3 and gene expression (digestive gland) 0.06 (p-value 1.04 1020) 0.11 (p-value 2.67 1024) Correlation between GC3 and gene expression (gills) 0.07 (p-value 4.20 1029) 0 (NS) Correlation between GC3 and gene expression (gills) 0.06 (p-value 6.14 1023) 0.12 (p-value 1.04 1028) Selection for translational speed Toward mutational bias towards A/T is counterbalanced by natural selection in favor of G/C-ending codons in a relevant number of genes. however, the weight of A/T mutational bias is still dominating over that of G/C selection in most oyster genes. the correlation between gene expression and ENC was not significant. however, unlike oyster, the selection for translational accuracy is biased towards A/T-ending codons. mutational bias and selection for translational accuracy are dominating over the opposite selection for translational speed in mussel. effective number of codons (ENC) values in bivalves range from the least to the most biased species. most bivalve species display a weak CUB, using on average over 50 out of the 61 available codons. lemyoidea 55.73 Laternula elliptica Anomalodesmata Cleidothaeridae 55.72 Argopecten irradians Pteriomorphia Pectinida 55.65 Ostrea lurida Pteriomorphia Ostreoidea 55.61 Pecten maximus Pteriomorphia Pectinida 55.61 Sinonovacula constricta Imparidentia Ad Corbicula fluminea Imparidentia Venerida 53.88 Pinctada maxima Pteriomorphia Pteriomorphia Pterioidea 53.47 Hiatella arctica Imparidentia Adapedonta 53.42 Cardites antiquata Archiheterodonta Carditoidea 52.92 Neotrigonia margaritacea Palaeoheterodonta Trigoniida 52.87 Vil paridentia Venerida 50.21 Ruditapes philipinarum Imparidentia Venerida 50.13 Atrina rigida Pteriomorphia Pinnoidea 49.62 Diplodonta sp. Imparidentia Cyamiidae 49.40 Geukensia demissa Pteriomorphia Mytilida 47.42 Cycladicama cumingii Imparidentia Cyami logeny and CUB-based clustering are in agreement, in several cases, up to the order level. the six major evolutionary lineages of anomalodesmata, Archiheterodonta, Imparidentia, Palaeoheterodonta, Protobranchia and Pteriomorphia are expected from molecular phylogeny. group I-a comprises all the Pectinida and Ostreoidea species (Pteriomorphia), two Anomalodesmata (M. anomiodes and L. elliptica), two Protobranchia (E. tenuis and S. velum) and the Imparidentia G. turtoni, M. arenaria and S. constricta. the subgroup I-b comprises Unionida and Trigoniida (Palaeoheterodonta), Pinctada spp. (Pteriomorphia), eight unrelated Imparidentia and the three Archiheterodonta species. the observed CUB is slightly higher, including species with ENC ranging from 52 to 54, but GC3 is remarkably lower than group Ia, averaging 43%. the RSCU values of ACA (Thr), AGA and AGT (Arg), TCA (Ser), TGT (Cys), CCA (Pro), GCT (Ala) and GGA (Gly) are always lower than 1, indicating that these codons are avoided in all species. in general, A/T-ending codons appear to be preferred over those ending in G/T. the frequency of G/C ending codons is significantly and negatively correlated with CUB in all cases, with the exception of TTG (Leu) this measure is a variation of ENC which is scaled in a range from 0 to 1 for each amino acid independently from the level of redundancy. sENC-x values are plotted on the Y axis and represent the relative intensity of CUB for each amino acid in each species. sENC-x values are plotted on the Y axis and represent the relative intensity of CUB for each amino acid in each species. senc-x values are plotted on the Y axis and represent the relative intensity of CUB for each amino acid in each species. GC3 and AT3 contents become even in species displaying weak CUB (and high ENC) the bivalves pertaining to the clustering group Ia, Ib and II possess a similar genomic GC content, lower than all the bivalve species included in the heterogeneous clustering group I. selection for translational speed and accuracy are certainly among the most relevant, as they can potentially overcome and mask the effects of mutational bias on CUB. the correlation between gene expression and CUB is not universally applicable, as the correlation between gene expression and CUB is not universally applicable. differences in selective constraints between prokaryotes and eukaryotes have been evoked to explain this contradiction. the relationship between CUB and protein length remains obscure. we correlated CUB with gene expression (in three tissues: digestive gland, gills and hemocytes) and with ORF (protein) length (Table 2). Crassostrea gigas and Mytilus galloprovincialis coding GC3 49.27% 30.80% Global ENC 55.24 45.58 Genomic GC content 33.69% 31.65% Mutational bias Towards A/T-ending codons Correlation between CUB and protein length 0.03 (p-value 9.14 108) 0.09 (p-value 3.75 1018) Correlation between GC3 and protein length 0.03 (p-value 9. p-value 6.14 1023) 0.12 (p-value 1.04 1028) selection for translational speed Towards G/C-ending codons Correlation between CUB and GC3 0.16 (p-value 5.42 10148) 0.53 (p-value 0) Prevailing factor at the whole protein-coding transcriptome scale Mutational bias Mutational bias and selection for translational accuracy. the reference set of highly expressed genes for each species is based on the orthologous genes of C. gigas. in all species pertaining to clustering group I, the mutational bias towards A/T-ending codons is countered by the opposite forces of selection for translational speed and accuracy. this is the first time that CUB is systematically investigated in such a large and important class of invertebrates. bivalves can be divided into two distinct groups, based on the intensity of the bias towards the use of optimal codons. we investigated this issue in C. gigas and M. galloprovincialis. selection for translational accuracy, evidenced by correlation between protein length and CUB, is also active in bivalves. the direction of this selective force varies across species, either reinforcing (in M. galloprovincialis) or counteracting (in C. gigas) mutational bias appears to be two major players in this process. further study will be certainly needed to ascertain whether this model can be extended to all bivalve species once additional genomic resources will become available. the oyster genome has already shown that homology-based annotation methods perform rather poorly for certain gene families. a number of algorithms which take into account species-specific CUB information have been developed, trying to identify protein coding sequences based on their congruence with a reference codon usage table.
