{"summary": "the eaeA gene encodes the 97 kDa surface protein intimin. intimin is required for attachment and effacement during the interaction of enterohemorrhagic E. coli with human and bovine neonatal enterocytes. the amount of E. coli O157:H7 in feces was measured for 30 days post-challenge. the magnitude of fecal E. coli O157:H7 shedding did not correlate with the presence of intimin-specific fecal IgA. the infective dose of E. coli O157:H7 is low for both calves and humans. in some cases approximately only 102 organisms are required to cause infection. adult cattle typically continue to shed bacteria in their feces for weeks to months. a specific adaptive mucosal immune response directed against the surface antigen intimin might prevent or reduce the colonization of E. coli O157:H7 in cattle. it is suggested that intimin on the surface of EHEC would bind to nucleolin [25]. calves were fed 2 liters of antibiotic-free milk replacer twice daily and given water ad libitum. the presence of Salmonella was evaluated by incubation of fecal samples in tetrathionate broth (Difco), followed by enrichment in Rappaport-Vassiliadis R10 broth (Difco). the inoculum was added to 950 ml of milk replacer and used to orally inoculate calves on days 0, 14 and 28. the bacterial titer of the inoculum was determined by plating serial dilutions onto LB agar plates, incubating plates overnight at 37\u00b0C, and enumerating the colonies. 96-well microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 100 l/well (5 g/ml) His-tagged intimin. plate was washed 3 times with wash buffer, then blocked for 1 h. wells were washed 3 times with wash buffer, then incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C. feces were collected in 50 ml centrifuge tubes from all calves. feces were weighed and liquefied by the addition of ice-cold 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer pH 4.5. a cocktail of soybean trypsin inhibitor, aprotinin, and phenylmethylsulphonyl chloride (PMSF) was added to this mixture. cells were washed 2 times with PBS-citrate and then resuspended in RPMI medium. cells were counted using trypan blue exclusion dye and a hemacytometer. cells were kept on ice until they were aliquoted for the ELISpot assay. antigen stimulated spots were reported by subtracting the number of spots obtained from wells without stimulant from the number of spots obtained in stimulant-added wells. bacteria were enumerated by plating serial dilutions onto XLT-4 plates (Beckton Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ) tissue samples for bacteriology and histopathology were collected from abomasum, omasum, duodenum, jejunum, ileum, cecum spiral colon, distal colon, rectum and mesenteric lymph node. homogenates of each tissue were prepared in the Stomacher by mincing two 6 mm biopsy punches in phosphate-buffered saline. his-tagged EaeA was produced by cloning the coding region of eaeA into pET16b (Novagen, Gibbstown, NJ) expression and purification of His-tagged EaeA on NTA-Nickel resin was performed according to manufacturer's instructions. vaccinated group consisted of 5 calves inoculated with 109-1010 pRB3::eaeA suspended in 50 ml of inoculum buffer in milk replacer. bacterial titer of inoculum was determined by plating serial dilutions onto LB agar plates, incubating plates overnight at 37\u00b0C, and enumerating the colonies. fecal samples from all the calves were collected daily from day 0 to day 42 post-inoculation to determine the level of vaccine strain shedding. fecal samples from all the calves were collected daily for 30 days to determine the amount of E. coli shedding following oral challenge with E. coli strain 86-24 on day 98. conjugate (Bethyl, Montgomery, TX) diluted 1:1000 in wash buffer with 3% (wt/vol) dried nonfat milk powder were added to each well. plates were washed 3 times with wash buffer, then incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. feces were collected in individual sterile 50 ml centrifuge tubes from all calves. intimin-specific IgA-secreting cells in peripheral blood were incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight with 0.5 ug affinity purified bovine IgA diluted in coating buffer (50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated as described earlier. 105 PBMC were plated in duplicate wells. cells were stimulated with His-tagged intimin (200 ng per well) or PHA (100 ng/well from the Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO) cells were rinsed once with distilled water, then washed 3 times with PBS containing 0.05% Tween 20. ten g samples of feces were immediately processed in a Stomacher. the sensitivity of the direct plating was 50 CFU/g. a 10 g sample was added to enrichment broth (Tryptic Soy Broth with 0.15% bile salts) the interaction of an independent has an effect on the dependent. if the probability of F is less than 0.05 for any such combination, we conclude that the interaction of the combination has an effect on the dependent. protein from overnight cultures of S. Dublin aroA, S. Dublin aroA with pRB3::eaeA, or E. coli K12 with pEB310 were separated on 4-20% SDS-PAGE. full-length intimin protein is 96 kD (upper arrow) present in both S. Dublin with pRB3::eaeA and lane 3, E. coli K12 with pEB310. fecal samples from calves were collected daily from all calves from day 0 to day 42 post-inoculation for Salmonella culture. peripheral blood samples were collected weekly after inoculation to measure levels of serum IgA and to detect intimin-specific IgA-secreting cells. most calves shed the vaccine strains intermittently until the end of the experiment (126 days post-immunization) moving average trendline was calculated by setting the period as 2, with the average of the first two data points used as the first point in the moving average trendline. serum IgA antibody response Intimin-specific IgA was measured weekly in the serum of all calves throughout the experiment. concentrations were measured by ELISA. bar graph depicts mean (standard deviation) of animals in each group. intimin-specific fecal IgA antibody concentrations were measured. shedding of E. coli O157:H7 All calves were challenged orally with intimin. there was a significant time effect (P 0.001) and treatment time interaction (P = 0.001). levels of shedding were lower in animals receiving the intimin-expressing vaccine strain. eaeA gene including upstream promoter region from E. coli O157:H7 86-24 was amplified by PCR from pEB310 and cloned into the low copy, RK2-based plasmid pRB3 [29]. this plasmid contains the par (partition) locus from RK2 and insures plasmid segregation and stable maintenance even in absence of selection. the full-length intimin protein is 96 kD (upper arrow) present in both S. Dublin with pRB3::eaeA and E. coli K12 with pEB310. a smaller immunoreactive protein (lower arrow) is present in both S. Dublin with pRB3::eaeA and lane 3, E. coli K12 with pEB310. peripheral blood samples were collected weekly after inoculation to measure levels of serum IgA and to detect intimin-specific IgA-secreting cells. most calves shed the vaccine strains intermittently until the end of the experiment (126 days post-immunization), indicating the establishment of the vector/vaccine strain in the host. antibody response Intimin-specific IgA was measured weekly in the serum of all calves throughout the experiment. sporadic increase in intimin-specific IgA levels was observed in all animals. intimin-specific IgA secreting cells in peripheral blood mononuclear cells were measured by ELISA. the bar graph depicts the mean (standard deviation) of animals in each group. vaccinated calves descended into the \"valley\" of the trendline earlier than those who received the vector. levels of shedding were lower in animals receiving the intimin-expressing vaccine strain. intimin is an outer membrane protein expressed by several human and animal pathogens, including enteropathogenic E. coli and EHEC. anti-intimin immune responses can modulate the outcome of experimental infection with the EPEC-like bacterium Citrobacter rodentium in rabbits. intimin can elicit protective immune responses in the bovine intestinal tract. intimin-specific IgA in serum and feces was not significantly higher in calves receiving intimin-expressing S. Dublin. however, cattle immunized with the intimin-expressing strain group exhibited a reduced magnitude and duration of E. coli O157:H7 shedding following oral challenge. anti-intimin fecal IgA levels did not correlate with fecal shedding. anti-intimin fecal IgA levels did not correlate with fecal shedding. anti-intimin fecal IgA levels were identified in rectal mucus. reduction in colonization and shedding was obtained in this study by oral vaccination without a preceding parenteral inoculation. however, oral vaccines can significantly boost mucosal immune responses when primed by parenteral vaccine administration. 78 student workers and the farm manager provided animal care to the project."}
