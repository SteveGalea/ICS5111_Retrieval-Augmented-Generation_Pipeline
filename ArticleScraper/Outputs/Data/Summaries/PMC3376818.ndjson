{"summary": "the study database consisted of 398 unique human infectious disease outbreak events collected from Disease Outbreak News. for each outbreak, we defined the initial source or sources of the first public communication as the individual, organization, or website that first publicly communicated information regarding the disease threat. all outbreaks were categorized as having been first communicated by >1 nongovernmental or governmental sources, or simultaneously by both types of sources. Variable Governmental sources Nongovernmental sources p value No. outbreaks Median no. days (95% CI) Period 1996\u20132009 163 33.0 (30\u201344) 103 23.0 (20\u201332) 0.200 Pre-SARS 90 39.5 (31\u201351) 61 29.0 (20\u201350) 0.161 Post-SARS 73 29.0 (25\u201337) 42 21.5 (17\u201332) 0.613 Geographic location Africa 85 37.0 (29\u201351) 41 31.0 (23 the median time from estimated outbreak start to initial public communication was 10 days shorter for nongovernmental sources (23 days, 95% CI 20\u201332) than for governmental sources (33 days, 95% CI 30\u201345) this difference was not significant according to the Wilcoxon rank-sum test (p = 0.200) the multivariate negative binomial regression model compared the timeliness of outbreaks first communicated by nongovernmental sources to those by governmental sources. the results provide support for the international health regulations 2005 revisions that allow WHO to use unofficial information to request verification from member states. more than one-third of unique infectious disease outbreaks in the WHO Disease Outbreak News during this 14-year period were initially reported by informal information sources. traditional governmental public health reporting mechanisms remain an integral source for outbreak information, accounting for almost two-thirds of all initial reports over this period."}
