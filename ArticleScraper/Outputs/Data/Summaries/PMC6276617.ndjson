{"summary": "pharyngitis is commonly caused by a self-limiting upper respiratory tract infection. symptoms typically include sore throat. antibiotics are often inappropriately used for the treatment of pharyngitis. patients with uncomplicated bacterial pharyngitis may benefit from the antibacterial action of antiseptic lozenges. antiseptic lozenges may be more relevant and appropriate than antibiotics for pharyngitis associated with a self-limiting viral URTI. antibiotics are ineffective against the viruses that caus\u00ea90% of cases, do not offer symptomatic relief and inappropriate antibiotic prescription can contribute to antimicrobial resistance. antiseptics are a class of antimicrobial agent which kill via a physical action on the bacteria. more common species recovered from patients presenting with symptoms of pharyngitis or with a clinical diagnosis of pharyngitis include Fusobacterium necrophorum,21 described in a recent study as a true pathogen rather than a colonizer of the oropharynx. the Streptococcus dysgalactiae subspecies equisimilis can cause severe or recurrent pharyngitis,3,17,23 the in vitro activity of 10 lozenge formulations has previously been investigated against S. pyogenes and S. aureus. in vitro bactericidal activity of aMC/DCBA lozenges was assessed. inoculum cultures were prepared for each challenge organism to give an approximate population of 108 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL in saline (0.9% sodium chloride [Fisher Scientific]) one inoculum suspension was prepared for each replicate tested. test organisms and incubations were cultured on tryptone soya agar. solutions were serially diluted to 105, plated onto appropriate agar medium and incubated for 3 days. inoculum cultures were prepared for each challenge organism to give an approximate population of 108 colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL in saline (0.9% sodium chloride [Fisher Scientific]). one inoculum suspension was prepared for each replicate tested. 1 mL of sample/inocula mixture was removed and transferred into 9 mL of neutralizing diluent. solutions were serially diluted to 105, plated onto the appropriate agar medium and incubated for a minimum of 3 days. a positive control sample of 4.9 mL artificial saliva medium and 0.1 mL of the test inoculum for each organism was prepared without exposure to test samples. s was small (0.9 log10 CFU/mL) indicating consistent and reproducible observations. s was small (mean log10 CFUs/mL SD) 1 minute 5 minutes 10 minutes Staphylococcus aureus 6.50.1 0.50.2 2.20.1 3.50.1 Streptococcus pyogenes 6.70.1 5.70.1 5.70.1 Moraxella catarrhalis 7.20.1 0.50.1 5.00.9 6.20.1 Haemophilus the decrease in CFU/mL at 1 minute exceeded 3 log10 (99.9% decrease), whereas greater than 3 log10 reductions were recorded at 5 minutes for S. dysgalactiae and M. catarrhalis. at all time points, the SD (Table 1) of the replicates was small (0.9 log10 CFU/mL) icidal activity was defined as a decrease in bacterial count (CFUs per mL), using the average of three test replicates. the organisms tested included gram-positive cocci and bacilli. bactericidal activity of an AMC/DCBA lozenge within a 10-minute period is important as it is consistent with the duration that a lozenge remains in the mouth. the active ingredients were also tested at the expected concentration achieved when a lozenge is dissolved in the mouth, assuming a volume of 5 mL of saliva. both AMC and DCBA formulations were highly active against the bacteria tested within 5 minutes of exposure. cases of inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for viral pharyngitis may be reduced. this study did not fully reflect the environment of the throat. the role of the patient\u2019s immune system and swallowing action on the antimicrobial activity of the lozenge or active ingredients can also not be determined using in vitro methodology."}
