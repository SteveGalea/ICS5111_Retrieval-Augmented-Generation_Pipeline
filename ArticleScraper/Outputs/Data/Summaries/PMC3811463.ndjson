{"summary": "enterovirus belongs to the family of Picornaviridae, a group of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes many important human pathogens. the genus Enterovirus belongs to the family of Picornaviridae, a group of positive-strand RNA viruses that includes many important human pathogens. well-known members of the HEV-A species are coxsackie A viruses and the emerging neurotropic enterovirus 71 (EV71) (1). the world health organization has predicted that COPD will become the third leading cause of death worldwide by the year 2030. there are two strategies to combat viral infections: the use of vaccines to prevent disease, or drugs to inhibit viral replication. a vaccine is only available for PV, while EV71 vaccine candidates are currently being evaluated in clinical trials (10, 11) a major concern with these compounds that directly target a viral protein is the rapid emergence of drug-resistant viruses. a potential disadvantage of host-targeting compounds is that interference with a cellular target may be associated with toxic side effects. cDNA was placed behind a hammerhead ribozyme coding sequence to remove extra nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end. cDNA was placed behind a hammerhead ribozyme coding sequence to remove extra nucleotides at the 5\u2032 end. cDNA was placed behind a hammerhead ribozyme coding sequence. a mengovirus strain of the cardiovirus encephalomyocarditis virus was obtained from cDNA clone pM16.1, generously provided by A.

PI4KIII as the major target of compounds 1 and 2 accountable for the inhibition of CVB3 replication. the pharmacokinetics of compound 2 were assessed in male mice. the compound was rapidly absorbed, with maximum plasma levels (Tmax) observed at 30 min postdosing. the clearance (Cl) was low, approximately 25% of the liver blood flow, and the volume of distribution (Vss) was high. pancreas sections obtained from mice treated with the highest compound 2 dose (25 mg/kg BID) showed no signs of inflammation, edema, or necrosis. partial protection against CVB4-induced pancreatitis was noted at a lower dose (5 mg/kg BID) mice were infected with CVB4, treated with compound 2 or left untreated. a score of 0 indicates complete absence of pathology, whereas a score of 3 refers to diffuse lesions throughout the tissue section. cytotoxicity of compound 1 was low, with CC50 values ranging from 11 to 65 M. nM was determined in parallel with the EC50 and using same culture conditions for 3 to 4 days. 0.024 0.019 1,983 Human rhinovirus B HRV14 HeLa Rh 0.031 0.024 1,535 HRV42 HeLa Rh 0.027 0.032 1,762 HRV70 HeLa Rh 0.024 0.027 1,983 HRV72 HeLa Rh 0.028 0.026 1,700 HRV86 HeLa Rh 0.031 1,983 a Data represent mean values SD of at least three independent assays. the compounds act at the level of viral RNA replication. we used CVB3-Rluc, a genetically engineered virus. it encodes Renilla luciferase upstream of the capsid coding region. cells were lysed to quantify the intracellular amount of luciferase. the compounds exerted their antiviral effects at the step of viral RNA replication in the enterovirus replication cycle. the compounds act at the stage of viral RNA replication. the single substitutions 3A-V45A and 3A-H57Y in 3A allowed CVB3 to replicate in the presence of compound 1 (20, 28) wild-type CVB3 replication was strongly inhibited (to virus input levels) at 1 and 5 M compound 1. compounds 1 and 2 inhibit PI4KIII activity in vitro kinase activity assay. compounds 1 and 2 inhibit PI4KIII activity in vitro. kinases include 13 lipid kinases at a concentration of 10 M. for all kinases, the inhibition was less than 10%. compound 1 specifically inhibits PI4KIII in vitro. a dramatic loss of the Golgi complex localization of the PI4P. compound 1 reduced the amount of Golgi complex-localized FAPP1-PH-GFP by 76% 4.8% (mean standard deviation [SD]; n = 10) compound 1 reduces the PI4P levels at the Golgi complex through a direct inhibition of PI4KIII activity. compound 1 inhibits PI4KIII in a competitive manner. mutant PI4KIII-Y583M carried the substitution Y583M in the ATP-binding pocket. this substitution weakens binding of the inhibitors wortmannin and PIK93. cells were transfected with either PI4KIII wt, PI4KIII-Y583M or as negative controls the kinase-dead PI4KIII-D656A or EGFP. two days later, the cells were infected with CVB3-Rluc in the presence of compound 1 and were lysed after 8 h to quantify the intracellular luciferase levels. similar expression levels of all PI4KIII proteins the amount of luciferase activity was quantified in the samples. bars represent means of three samples the SD. activity of compound 2 in a CVB4-induced pancreatitis mouse model. terminal blood samples were collected from three animals per time point. samples were centrifuged, and the supernatant was subjected to mass spectrometry analysis. -infected mice, serum lipase and amylase levels increased more than 10-fold and 5-fold respectively. a dose-dependent effect of compound 2 was observed with mice treated with the highest dose. infectious virus content was reduced by >2 log10 in mice treated with the highest dose. compound 2 exhibited a clear dose-dependent antiviral effect in vivo. single substitutions in 3A allowed the virus to replicate more efficiently in the presence of the compound. similar to previous results, compounds 1 and 2 also specifically inhibited the activity of PI4KIII in an in vitro kinase activity assay. PI4KIII is the major target of the compounds responsible for their effects on enterovirus replication. a recent study in the context of HCV treatment showed that conditional transgenic mice that served as models for pharmacologic inhibition of PI4KIII displayed a lethal phenotype (49) GW5074 and enviroxime have long been known to inhibit enteroviruses, but they were only recently shown to exert their antiviral effect by inhibiting PI4KIII (20, 22) the antienterovirus compound T-00127-HEV1 (51) was evaluated together with another novel PI4KIII inhibitor from Boehringer-Ingelheim for toxicity in SJL mice. the mice treated orally twice a day with 25 mg/kg compound 2 showed no signs of toxicity during 3 days of treatment. resistance developed only after a lengthy resistance selection process (16 weeks) it is questionable whether resistance will develop in vivo upon (short-term) treatment with PI4KIII inhibitors."}
