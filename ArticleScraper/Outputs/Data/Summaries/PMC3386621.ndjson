{"summary": "PRRSV is a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome size of approximately 15 kb. it causes acute respiratory disease in neonatal and young piglets and reproductive failure in pregnant sows. most RNA viruses induce type I interferon by sensing through endosomal toll-like receptors 3 and 7 (TLR3, 7), the cytoplasmic retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and/or melanoma differentiation-associated gene-5 (MDA-5). both TLR3 and RIG-1 recognize dsRNA molecules generated during RNA virus infections. studies have suggested the important role of IRF-7 in interferon- induction from plasmacytoid dendritic cells. the phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathway seems critical to the nuclear translocation of IRF-7 and the interferon- induction. the transcription and translation of type I interferon including interferon- and, but not other inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor- swine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is a member of the coronaviridae family. PRRSV infectivity is not essential to the inhibition of type I interferon in dendritic cells, which are resistant to PRRSV infection. the existing evidence clearly indicates that PRRSV activates the transcription of type I interferon in its natural susceptible cells. in MARC-145 cells, however, Miller reported that PRRSV failed to activate the transcription of interferon- and suppressed the transcription of interferon- activated by Poly I:C. this suggests a cell type dependent difference in activating the transcription by PRRSV. luciferase reporter gene expression system used to dissect the role of over-expressed viral proteins in regulating the transcriptional activation of type I interferon. such results are often contradictory to the authentic virus infection of natural susceptible cells in vitro and in vivo. a recent study has shown that PI3K/Akt inhibition can also lead to the phosphorylation of eIF-2 to inhibit cellular translation. however, it is more likely that PRRSV has employed multiple strategies to inhibit cellular protein synthesis as simple way to evade host defenses. studies have clearly shown that interferon mRNA has a short life span after induction. it is possible that the combination of high cytopathogenicity of virus and short half-life of interferon mRNAs may at least partially contribute to the low interferon proteins detected in virus-infected cells."}
