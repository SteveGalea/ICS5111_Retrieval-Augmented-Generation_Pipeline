{"summary": "tumor-treating fields treatment at 0.9 V/cm decreased cell viability and increased cytokine messenger RNA/protein levels. tumor-treating fields treatment activated nuclear factor B and mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways involved in immunomodulatory signaling. the clinical concept is that TTFs therapy delivers low-intensity (0.9-3 V/cm), intermediate-frequency (100-300 kHz) to the tumor using transducer arrays placed on the skin around the tumor site. the proposed mechanisms of action involve disruption of the metaphase of tumor cells by interfering with mitotic spindle formation and disruption of anaphase by the dielectrophoretic dislocation of intracellular constituents. tumor-associated macrophages play a crucial role in the link between inflammation and cancer to produce inflammatory cytokines. despite increasing studies of the effect of TTFs on cancers, the influence of TTFs on immune cells has not yet been determined. the cells were cocultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the amounts of IL-6 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California), IL-1 (BD Science, San Diego, California), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-; R&D System, Minneapolis, Minnesota) produced in the CM were determined with commercial enzyme-linked immunoassay kits. a trypan blue exclusion assay and 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide were performed. an equal volume of trypan blue reagent was added to the cell suspension. culture supernatants of RAW 264.7 cells were collected. each culture supernatant was mixed with the same amount of Griess reagent. the absorbance of the mixture was determined at 540 nm using a microplate reader. western Blot Analysis Total proteins from RAW 264.7 cells were extracted in TNN buffer (50 mM Tris\u2013Cl, pH 7.4; 1% NP-40; 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM EDTA) protein samples (15 g) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Statistical significance was defined as P values.05, and the individual P values in the figures denoted by asterisks. experimental Setup of the Electric Fields Tumor-treating fields were generated using a pair of insulated wires connected to a functional generator and a high-voltage amplifier. supernatants were harvested and filtered through 0.45 m membrane. cells were cocultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% antibiotics for 48 hours at 37\u00b0C. plated in 24-well plates (1 104 cells/well) for various times after treatment of the RAW 264.7 cell CM. absorbance measured at 540 nm using a microplate reader. the amounts of nitrites were determined using a standard curve established with NaNO2. quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction total RNA was extracted from RAW 264.7 cells using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). protein samples (15 g) were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membrane was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with mouse monoclonal antibodies against iNOS, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), phosphorylated ERK (pERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), pJNK, p38, p-p the normal morphology of RAW 264.7 cells was round in the control group. in contrast, LPS-treated cells showed polygonal and dendritic-like morphology, indicating that LPS effectively activated RAW 264.7 cells. the cell viability was determined by a trypan blue dye exclusion assay. nitric oxide (NO) is an important inflammatory mediator that can be produced by activated macrophages to kill tumors and pathogens. the production of NO in activated macrophages was slightly increased, whereas LPS stimulation significantly enhanced NO production. effects of TTFs on the production of proinflammatory cytokines by RAW 264.7 cells. mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- were determined. the mRNA levels of IL-1 and TNF- were significantly upregulated. cells treated with TTFs (0.9 V/cm) or LPS (1 ng/mL) for 24 hours. mRNA levels of IL-1 and TNF- were evaluated by qRT-PCR. 4T1 cells, untreated- or TTFs-treated RAW 264.7 cells designated as 4T1, Ct, and TTF. mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-B signaling pathways are vital targets for regulating inflammatory responses. the expression of 3 MAP kinase family members, namely, ERK, JNK, and p38 MAPK, was determined. levels of the indicated proteins were determined with Western blotting. a representative result of 3 independent experiments is shown. a representative result of 3 independent experiments is shown. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with TTFs (0.9 V/cm) for the indicated times. the bar graph represents the percentages of activated cells from a total of 500 counted cells. mRNA expression levels of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- were determined. mRNA levels of IL-1, TNF-, and IL-6 levels in the coculture medium were significantly increased at 48 hours in a manner dependent on the ratio of the 2 cells. 4T1 cells exposed to the CM of unstimulated RAW 264.7 cells did not show statistically significant decrease in viability. 4T1 cells exposed to CM from TTFs-treated RAW 264.7 cells showed decreased viability after 24 or 48 hours contact with the CM. these results suggested that TTFs activate macrophages and promote the expression of proinflammatory cytokines. untreated RAW 264.7 cells were designated as Ct. the percentage of cell viability was determined by the MTT assay. data represent the mean (standard deviation) of triplicate samples. inactive cytoplasmic complex with its inhibitor IB-.17 Tumor-treating fields showed increased phosphorylation of IB- and p65. p65 subunit of NF-B was released from IB-, allowing for its translocation to the nucleus to regulate the transcription of many genes that activate macrophages. TTFs have been tried in preclinical systems combined with cytotoxic, chemotherapeutic agents in order to enhance the general antitumor effects. in in vitro preclinical models, TTFs were shown to expose calreticulin to the cell surface, which ultimately decreased the tumor volume in vitro. inducible NOS is responsible for increased levels of NO. intracellular ROS also serves as a second messenger in inflammatory signal transduction by modulating the release of other inflammatory mediators and stimulating MAPK activity. however, the increase was much lower than that observed in LPS-treated cells. CM of TTFs-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells decreased, indicating that macrophage activation by TTFs effectively killed the tumor cells. nuclear factor-B is a ubiquitous transcription factor that plays a crucial role in inflammatory processes via the induction of a wide variety of genes. TFs did not cause cell death in RAW 264.7 cells; however, cell growth inhibition was clearly observed. this suggests highly proliferating cancer cells are selectively targeted by TTFs therapy."}
