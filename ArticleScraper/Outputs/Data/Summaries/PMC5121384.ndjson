{"summary": "the majority of respiratory infections are caused by viruses, the most common of which are rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and adenovirus (3). the infections account for a substantial proportion of outpatient medical visits and are associated with an estimated $17.3 billion in direct annual costs. multiplex respiratory PCR panels are increasingly being used in the outpatient setting for patients with upper respiratory infections. these tests can be simple to perform, provide rapid results, and can assay for multiple organisms from a single sample. the cost of these tests is significantly higher than those of previously used methods, but the added expense may be justified. a retrospective chart review was performed on 408 outpatients who met inclusion criteria and were enrolled in one of three study groups. patient demographic information was collected including age, influenza vaccine status, order location, admission status, presence of underlying lung disease, immunosuppression, clinical syndrome, and testing for other respiratory infectious diseases. all multiplex PCR testing was performed on posterior nasopharyngeal swabs. patients excluded from the study if their specimens were not obtained from a posterior nasopharyngeal swab at a Connecticut VA outpatient location. clinical turnaround time was the difference between the time of specimen collection and the time of the final result. clinical and laboratory TATs were compared using a Mann-Whitney U test or Kruskal-Wallis test. a P value of 0.01 was considered significant to correct for bias. no information on gender was extracted, but patients were overwhelmingly male. only clinical TAT and ICD-9-based clinical syndrome differed significantly between patients seen in the ED and those seen in other outpatient locations. when examined in greater detail, the differences were due to fewer being patients coded with URTI and related syndromes. none# 81 (27.5) 55 (48.7) 136 (33.3) Mean TAT (SD) (h) Clinical (NS) 3.2 (4.5) 2.3 (1.9) 3.0 (4.0) Intralaboratory (NS) 2.0 (3.0) 1.9 (1.7) 2.0 (2.7) No. (%) of patients with underlying lung disease (P 0.001) Asthma 20 (6.8) 2 (1.8) 22 (5.4) COPD# 40 (13.6) 29 (25.7)# 69 (16 standardized adjusted residual of >2.58 for each row.
