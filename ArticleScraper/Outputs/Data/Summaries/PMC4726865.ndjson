{"summary": "paediatric infectious diseases are characterised by a great heterogeneity of clinical manifestations due to the unique characteristics of the neonatal period and childhood. however, new advances in the field of Clinical Virology and Molecular Medicine have expanded the level of knowledge on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of viral infections occurring in infancy and childhood. workshop on paediatric Virology was attended by >500 participants from the five continents (8). the 20th world Congress on Advances in Oncology and the 18th International Symposium on Molecular Medicine was held in athens (Greece) workshop on paediatric virology at the university of athens in athens. initial idea for the birth of this Workshop was inspired in 2007 at the Wirral University Teaching Hospital in Wirral (UK), where cytomegalovirus (CMV)-positive twins were treated at the local Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (9), requiring the collaboration of an extended scientific network in Merseyside and Manchester (UK) on paediatric Virology\u2019 as an official session of the 20th world Congress on Advances in Oncology and the 18th International Meeting in Molecular Medicine. this workshop was dedicated to promoting international scientific exchange and cooperation of clinicians and researchers on Paediatric Virology and improving biomedical research and paediatric medical practice on viral infections occurring in childhood. prematurely born infants may have a genetic predisposition to developing RSV LRTIs. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes were found to be associated with chronic respiratory morbidity during infancy. other respiratory viral infections also adversely influence respiratory outcomes during infancy in those born prematurely. 80% of the world population lives in polio-free regions. in 2013\u20132014 an upsurge of polio in areas considered polio-free occurred. the confirmed circulation of wild-type poliovirus (WPV) in Israel and the outbreak of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Syria mean there is a high risk of the disease being reintroduced into Europe. HBeAg is tolerated in utero and acts as a tolerogen after birth. perinatal transmission is frequent when mothers are HBeAg-positive. perinatal transmission is frequent when mothers are HBeAg-negative. most frequent carcinogen in humans, causing approximately 530,000 cases of cervical cancer per annum, with the majority occurring in developing countries (38\u201340). the link between this deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus and cervical cancer was firstly suspected in the early 1970s by Professor Harald zur Hausen, who in 2008 received the Nobel prize in Physiology and Medicine (41). children and Ebola infection EV was first discovered in 1976. it has caused three outbreaks, two simultaneously in 1976 and one in 2014. the exact mode of transmission of EV remains unknown. it seems to be transmitted from the biological fluids of wild animals. staff should always suspect bioterrorism if a few or several people present with unusual or unexpected symptoms or if their symptoms do not conform with a certain medical diagnosis. identifying, isolate and inform is the current standard approach to EV suspicion (53) the role of epinephrine and nebulised bronchodilators in combination with systemic corticosteroids is questioned, but can be given on an individualised basis. other therapies, such as Heliox, surfactant and ribavirin, are also being examined, with controversial results thus far. outbreaks of the vaccine preventable strains have reappeared throughout Europe (63\u201365), Asia (66,67) and the united states (68,69) the loss of credibility of the vaccine remains a concern. this can be partly explained by failure to effectively communicate. ophthalmia neonatorum is defined as conjunctival inflammation developing within the first month of life. it is the most common type of infection in neonates, occurring in up to 10% of neonates. it is often identified as a specific entity distinct from conjunctivitis in older infants. the early diagnosis of ocular viral disease in children should aid in the amelioration of acute symptoms and in the prevention of long-term complications. otorhinolaryngologists versus HPV-associated lesions HPV is responsible for many benign lesions of the airway tract and the genital area in the adult population. microsurgery, transoral laser microsurgery (TLM) and endoscopic endonasal approach (EEA) are some of the most frequent surgical methods of excision. the most common approach of surgical treatment is using TLM. laser treatment can cause several complications, such as stenosis, burns of the airway tract and scars. possible complications include meningoencephalitis, haemolytic anaemia, thrombocytopenia, rash, conjunctivitis, haemophagocytic syndrome, myocarditis, neurologic diseases, pancreatitis, parotitis, pericarditis, psychological disorders and splenic rupture. a reduction of B-lymphocytes and an increase in the number of CD3+CD8+, T-lymphocyte a group of non-enveloped, double-stranded DNA viruses with icosahedral symmetry first described in January 2008. the prototype sequence of MCPyV has a 5,387 base pair genome and contains the early region. the genome of MCPyV has been detected in approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) cases (95) respiratory tract system is involved as a unique reservoir of MCPyV in children and respiratory secretions seem to play a significant role in MCPyV transmission in childhood. future studies are required in order to fully elucidate the potential implications of MCPyV infection in neoplasms in children. single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in several genes were found to be associated with chronic respiratory morbidity during infancy and reduced lung function at one year following an RSV LRTI (18). other respiratory viral infections adversely influence respiratory outcomes during infancy in those born prematurely. in 2013\u20132014 an upsurge of polio in areas considered polio-free occurred. the confirmed circulation of wild-type poliovirus (WPV) in Israel and the outbreak of acute flaccid paralysis in Syria mean there is a high risk of the disease being reintroduced into Europe. in Greece, there is a national action plan, which includes programmes to sustain high levels of polio immunisation coverage. HBeAg is tolerated in utero and acts as a tolerogen after birth. perinatal transmission is frequent when mothers are HBeAg-positive. perinatal transmission occurs significantly less frequently when mothers are HBeAg-negative. deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus and cervical cancer were firstly suspected in the early 1970s by Professor Harald zur Hausen. in the same year, two vaccines against HPV, the bivalent HPV 16/18 and the quadrivalent HPV 6/11/16/18, were implemented into clinical practice in several countries, worldwide (42). current trends indicate low HPV vaccination uptake among female adolescents in several countries in Europe (43\u201346) the 2014 west africa outbreak claimed a case fatality, which ranged from 25 to 90% and a total number of roughly 10,000 fatalities. this fact makes it a potential lethal tool in bio-warfare. emergency departments should be ready for such attacks, especially catering for the needs of paediatric victims. Viral bronchiolititis remains the leading cause of infant admission to the PICU (54,55) many other viruses account for bronchiolitis, either as co-infection with RSV or as the only aetiological pathogen. fluid replacement, oxygen supplementation and close monitoring are the first steps in the management of the disease. epinephrine and nebulised bronchodilators in combination with systemic corticosteroids are questioned, but can be given on an individualised basis. a lot of emphasis has been given to the prevention of the illness. ared throughout Europe (63\u201365), Asia (66,67) and the united states (68,69) the loss of credibility of the MMR vaccine remains a concern. this can be partly explained by failure to effectively communicate. ophthalmia neonatorum is defined as conjunctival inflammation developing within the first month of life. it is the most common type of infection in neonates, occurring in up to 10% of neonates. it is often identified as a specific entity distinct from conjunctivitis in older infants. the early diagnosis of ocular viral disease should aid in the amelioration of acute symptoms and in the prevention of long-term complications. otorhinolaryngologists are the specialists, who treat children with HPV-related lesions localised in the oral cavity, the oropharynx and larynx. the most common approach of surgical treatment is using TLM. laser treatment can cause several complications, such as stenosis. microdebriders provide a more accurate excision, removing only the affected tissue and preserving the healthy tissue. ophagocytic syndrome, myocarditis, neurologic diseases, pancreatitis, parotitis, pericarditis, pneumonitis, psychological disorders and splenic rupture. a reduction of B-lymphocytes and an increase in the number of CD3+CD8+, T-lymphocytes have been described in the various phases of EBV infection (88). the genome of MCPyV has been detected in approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) cases. it is a relatively rare, highly aggressive, human skin cancer of neuroendocrine origin, but its worldwide incidence has increased over the past twenty years. between 1 and 2% of infected children will require hospitalisation. up to 8% of those hospitalised will require mechanical ventilation. there are many risk factors for severe acute acute RSV infection. single nucleotide polymorphisms were found to be associated with chronic respiratory morbidity during infancy and reduced lung function at one year following an RSV LRTI (18). other respiratory viral infections also adversely influence respiratory outcomes during infancy in those born prematurely, including human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human rhinovirus (HRV) wild-type poliovirus (WPV) in Israel and the outbreak of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) in Syria mean there is a high risk of the disease being reintroduced into Europe. polio vaccination has been one of the most successful public health programmes in history, reducing the number of polio cases by 99%. perinatal transmission is frequent when mothers are HBeAg-positive. perinatal transmission occurs significantly less frequently when mothers are HBeAg-negative. genotypes A-D, F, H and I are further classified into subgenotypes. in the same year, two vaccines against HPV, the bivalent HPV 16/18 and the quadrivalent HPV 6/11/16/18, were implemented into clinical practice in several countries, worldwide (42). current trends indicate low HPV vaccination uptake among female adolescents in several countries in Europe (43\u201346) the 2014 west africa outbreak claimed a case fatality, which ranged from 25 to 90%. this fact makes it a potential lethal tool in bio-warfare. if used in residential areas, as a biological agent, EV can easily affect the welfare and life of children. bronchiolitis is the leading cause of infant admission to the PICU (54,55) many other viruses account for bronchiolitis, either as co-infection with RSV or as the only aetiological pathogen. the role of epinephrine and nebulised bronchodilators in combination with systemic corticosteroids is questioned. it has not been investigated for possible use in the PICU. other therapies, such as Heliox, surfactant and ribavirin, are also being examined. ocular viral infections in neonates and children vary greatly and can range from innocuous to vision threatening (73). the majority of viral conjunctivitis in children are caused by adenovirus, a DNA virus. ophthalmia neonatorum is defined as conjunctival inflammation developing within the first month of life. it is often identified as a specific entity distinct from conjunctivitis in older infants. it is often the result of infection transmitted from the mother to the infant during delivery (74) the most common clinical expression of HPV is recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) in children, the most common clinical expression of HPV is recurrent respiratory papillomatosis (RRP) it causes hoarseness of the voice and sometimes the lesions can cause obstruction of the upper airway track. the most common approach of surgical treatment is using TLM. but laser treatment can cause several complications, such as stenosis, burns of the airway tract and scars. microdebriders provide a more accurate excision, removing only the affected tissue. immunophenotypic alterations of lymphocytes have been described in the various phases of EBV infection (88) a reduction of B-lymphocytes and an increase in the number of CD3+CD8+, T-lymphocytes have been noted. the genome of MCPyV has been detected in approximately 80% of Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) cases. MCPyV is integrated into the host genome in a monoclonal manner. the viral T antigen has truncating mutations which render the T antigen unable to initiate the DNA replication required to propagate the virus."}
