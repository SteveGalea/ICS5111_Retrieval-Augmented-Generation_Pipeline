{"summary": "human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and -2), hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and -2 (HTLV-1 and -2), vaccinia virus (VACV) and west Nile virus (WNV) the array detected: 10 genome equivalents (geq)/ml of HIV-2 and HCV, 50 geq of HIV-1 (subtype B), H a number of different PCR based assays have been developed [1]\u2013[4] for simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens in a single assay. microarrays based on nucleic acid hybridization are too complex in design and performance for the routine donors testing. PCR multiplexing should be highly useful when both the volume of the samples and the time of testing are critical. human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1 and HIV-2), human T-cell leukemia virus-1 and -2 (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2), hepatitis C virus (HTLV-1 and HTLV-2), hepatitis C virus (HTLV) and west Nile virus (WNV) all with single-stranded RNA genome; vaccinia virus (VACV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV), both with double HIV-1 were estimated to contain 50 to 90,000 genome copy numbers per ml. six plasma samples positive for HCV were estimated to contain 780 to 123,000 genome copy number/ml. five plasma samples positive for HBV were estimated to contain 150 to 16,000 copy number/ml. primer dimers based on melting T peak (Tm) were checked using \"Primer Express\" software. primers were checked using the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) basic local alignment search tool. primers specific for the human beta-globin gene were included in the array as an internal control for the quality of DNA/RNA preparation as well as for estimation of viral copy number per host cell if needed.

(330 Da 2). an RNA/DNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol, dissolved in 10 l of DEPC-treated water. the volume of cDNA/DNA sample was then adjusted up to 30 l with DEPC-treated water. the whole volume (1.25 l per each of 24 primer sets) was immediately used for PCR array testing. data were collected in experiments from 8 human cellular DNA controls and 3 negative donors\u2019 plasma. to standardized the C(t) cut off for all primers the threshold was set at the PCR machine default setting. three separate HIV-1 RNA panels were used for testing of commercially licensed NAT assays. the first consisted of various amounts of an HIV-1 group M subtype B isolate: 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 500 copies/ml. the second consisted of 25 samples representing various concentrations of HIV-1 groups. 93TH073 (#2390; M, E), 93BR019 (#2314; M, F), and 93BR029 (#2338; M, F) from the UNAIDS Network for HIV Isolation and Characterization [16]. HIV-1 isolate JR-CSF (#394; M, B) from Dr. Irvin Chen [17]\u2013[18]. HIV-1 groups and subtypes are based on designations reported by the NIH ARRRP. low passage virus stocks were prepared and median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/ml of virus containing supernatant determined in fresh human PBMCs isolated as previously described. the amount of each clinical sample was sufficient to be tested only once by the PCR array in the study. all positive PCR products obtained in the testing using the PCR array were confirmed for validity by sequencing. newly designed and previously published primer sets adapted for the final version of the real-time PCR array are listed in Table 1. primers specific for the human beta-globin gene were included in the array as an internal control for the quality of DNA/RNA preparation.

PCR PCR was performed using \"Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time System\" one reaction contained: 12.5 l of PCR master mix, 0.5 M of each primer and 1.25 l of DNA/cDNA template. in the single virus testing we used 2.5 l of DNA/cDNA template. the C(t) cut off calculated from the range (n = 50) of the 1st type of negative control data was C(t)41.03. The C(t) cut off calculated from the range (n = 50) of the 2nd type of negative control data was C(t)41.03. subtype B isolate: 0, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 500 copies/ml. the second panel consisted of 25 samples representing various concentrations of HIV-1 groups O and N. the third panel consisted of HIV-1 circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) AE and AG: 100, 1,000, and 10,000 copies/ml for each virus. HIV-1 isolate 92US660 (#1722; M, B) from Dr. Irvin Chen [17]\u2013[18]; HIV-1 isolate 92HT599 (#3301; M, B) from Dr. Neal Halsey; HIV-1 isolate 93IN101 (#2900; M, C) from Dr. Robert Bollinger. infectious unit (IU) of the virus stocks in TCID50s were titrated for each isolate. the number of IU used for viral RNA isolation was calculated based on the dilution factor (1100) and ranged from 10 to 2,500 or 1 to 3.4 log10 TCID50 per PCR reaction. experimental testing and selection of the Virus Specific Primer Sets for the Real-time PCR Array Each candidate primer pair was first tested for its specificity and sensitivity of PCR amplification. this was assessed in a real-time PCR cross-testing against human PBMC DNA (50 ng/PCR reaction) from a healthy donor. sensitivity was determined in this assay to be 10 viral genome copies/PCR. a total of 24 primer pairs targeting the eight different viruses were chosen for the real-time PCR array based on their specificity and sensitivity. sensitivity expressed in genome copy/PCR for each primer set was estimated using the NSAs. one out of four primer sets targeting HIV-1, NP3/4, could detect the subtype B HIV-1 RNA at the concentration of 50 copies/ml of human plasma. the 4th primer set, NP175/174, could detect the virus only at 500 viral genome copies/ml of plasma. plasma1 Result HIV-1 RNA (subtype B) (copy number/PCR) 4 primer sets 1901 0 /// 1902 10 (1.25) /// 1903 50 (6.25) +/// 1904 100 (12.5) +/+/+/ 1905 500 (62.5) +/+/+ 2 1906 100 (12.5) +/+/+/ 1907 25 (3.1) /// HIV-2 RNA 3 primer sets 1 0 // 2 5 (0.6) // 3 10 (1.25) /+ the order of the primers in testing was: four primer sets targeting HIV-1: NP3/4, NP51/52, NP170/171 and NP175/174; three primer sets targeting HIV-2: NP84/85, NP86/87 and NP76/77; three primer sets targeting HBV: NP11/97, NP94/100 and NP11/97-mod; three primer sets targeting HCV: NP13/14 and NP13/14-mod HIV-1 specific primer sets amplified HIV-1 subtype B (group M) with the highest sensitivity (50\u2013500 copies/ml of plasma) table 3. Sensitivity of four HIV-1 specific primer sets selected for real-time PCR array. RNA from 1 ml of plasma was converted to cDNA and divided into eight PCR reactions. RNA from 1 ml of plasma was divided into eight PCR reactions. the estimated copy number per PCR reaction is shown in parentheses. all three HIV-2 isolates studied (1\u20133 log10 TCID50/PCR input) were detected with all HIV-2 specific primer sets with a low Ct value: 12\u201320. total 25 HIV-1 clinical isolates from group M, O and N with three different isolates were used in testing. no cross-reactivity was detected for any primer sets in the array. seventeen (17) clinical plasma samples from donors tested positive for HIV-1, HBV, or HCV were used to evaluate the array sensitivity and specificity. genome copy of each virus in virus-positive plasma samples was previously determined by the NIH Blood Bank using commercial assays approved for donor screening. values of 25.5\u201326.3 (wells H3, H6 and H9 - Figure 2) show that the quality of the RNA/DNA sample preparation was equally good for the plasma of these three patients. the color scheme, shown as a footnote, refers to each virus and reflects the specific primer sets loaded into the array.

IU of the virus stocks in TCID50s were titrated for each isolate. the number of IU used for viral RNA isolation was calculated based on the dilution factor. the genome copy number of each virus in virus-positive plasma samples was previously determined by the NIH Blood Bank using commercial assays approved for donor screening. the threshold cycle cut off of the assay performed with plasma samples was set up as C(t)43. the wells with C(t) lower than the cut-off and the obtained Tm peaks within the expected Tm range indicate positive amplification of HBV target genes. pt.#13\u2013pt.#15 and one no-template control (NTC) were tested in one assay. expected Tm peaks for each amplicon are shown in italic, experimentally obtained Tm peaks are shown in bold italic, and C(t) values from the experimental testing are shown in bold. all six HCV-positive samples (#7 to #12) with 16\u20132,570 viral genome copies/ml of plasma tested positive with both HBV-specific primer sets. three HBV-positive samples (#15, #16, #17) with 6\u201310 copies/PCR tested positive with two out of three HBV-specific primer sets. n/A HCV Tm C(t) Tm C(t) 7 786 0.5 16 84.2 37.6 84.0 35.3 8 2,352 0.5 49 84.0 32.9 84.0 32.6 9 3,051 0.5 64 83.8 34.1 83.8 33.7 10 11,502 0.5 240 84.2 28.9 84.2 28.3 11 49,140 0.5 1,024 84.2 27.8 84.2 27.3 12 123,390 0.5 2,570 84.6 29. PCR based on PCR with SYBR Green chemistry supports simultaneous detection and identification of 24 different targets corresponding to eight different viruses. the strategy of primer selection for the array included the sequential use of different bioinformatics programs to identify highly-specific primer sets with a maximum variants\u2019 coverage of the targeted viruses. primer sets targeting group O isolates of HIV-1, as well as subtype F (group M) will need to be included in the array to increase the coverage of all existing subtypes/groups of the HIV-1. there is no official fda approved PCR-based NAT testing for blood donors\u2019 screening for HTLV-1 and HTLV-2. all 17 samples were correctly identified in our PCR array with a high sensitivity to contain HIV-1, HCV, or HBV. quantitative quantification by the assay is not always possible when the genetic group of the viral isolate being tested is different than the assay standards. commercial assays underestimate viral loads by up to 1\u201310 log10 copies per ml. the sensitivity of detecting HBV and HCV by our PCR array appeared to be in a similar range. the LOD for HIV-2 (subtype A) is 43.4 geq/ml by \u201cCobas s 201\u201d. other PCR-coupled techniques have been developed for highly-sensitive pathogens\u2019 detection that could reach the sensitivity of the assay up to 1 genome copy per PCR reaction. the current array was developed utilizing five previously published and 19 originally designed primers sets. however, it can be expanded to a larger number of targets for the same virus. Targeting of several genome areas increases the detection sensitivity of the target virus and provides an intra-assay confirmation of positive signals. additionally, any new virus of interest can be added to the list of targeted pathogens. Efforts are underway to test the utility of this real-time PCR array using samples with more diverse biological origin each virus specific primer set selected for the real-time PCR array."}
