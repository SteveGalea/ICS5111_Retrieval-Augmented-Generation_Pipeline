{"summary": "human parainfluenza viruses are important causes of upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) and lower respiratory tract illness (LRTI) patients with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) were studied in southern china. co-infections were common, with 33.3%\u201363.2% of samples positive for the four HPIV types also testing positive for other respiratory pathogens. however, no significant differences were seen in clinical presentation between patients solely infected with HPIV and patients co-infected with HPIV. the aims of this study were to explore the epidemiologic features and clinical manifestations of HPIVs and other common respiratory pathogens in children and adults with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) the samples were refrigerated at 2 to 8\u00b0C and transported on ice to state key laboratory of Respiratory Diseases and analysed every working day. patients with convulsion were categorized as having an gastrointestinal illness. patients with convulsion were categorized as having an neurologic symptom. patients with other symptoms, including but not limited to rash, were classified as \u201cothers\u201d all tests were two-tailed and p0.05 was considered statistically significant. Throat swab samples were collected from patients with ARTI. bronchopneumonia was defined as an acute illness with radiographic pulmonary shadowing which was at least segmental or present in one lobe. bronchopneumonia was defined as inflammation of the walls of the smaller bronchial tubes. other clinical symptoms were identified by common medical examinations and clinical descriptions. the median age was 4.75 (interquartile range, 1.00 to 25.00) pathogens were detected in 2439/4755 (51.3%) samples. the pathogens identified most frequently were infA (833/4755; 17.5%), RSV (524/4755; 11.0%) and MP (274/4755; 5.8%) 103 7 0 3 1 3 10 0 2.2 EV 226 3 6 5 0 9 0 4.8 229E 35 6 2 0 1 0 0.7 OC43 88 2 0 1 1 0.7 HKU1 20 5 0 0.4 MP 274 0 5.8 CP 7 0.1 1 pathogen 35 7 66 4 726 171 392 107 125 57 124 13 43 14 8 196 5 44.0 2 pathogens. the male to female ratio was 139:39 in HPIV-positive patients and 2759:1818 in HPIV-negative patients (p0.001). the child to adult ratio was 162:12 in HPIV-positive patients and 2627:1950 in HPIV-negative patients (p0.001). the vast majority of co-infections were in children (64/66; 97.0%), especially in patients under 5 years of age. the co-infection rate of HPIV-2 was 63.2% (12/19), the rate of HPIV-4 was 50% (4/8) the rate of HPIV-1 was 39.7% (23/58) and the rate of HPIV-3 was 33.3% (33/99) HPIV-2 (n=18) HPIV-3 (n=97) HPIV-4 (n=8) p value# Nasal obstruction 55(31.6) 1324(31.0) 0.862 20(35.1) 4(22.2) 31(32) 3(37.5) 0.767 34(31.2) 21(32.3) 0.878 Coryza 68(39.1) 1568(36.7) 0.523 22(38.6) 7(38.9) 44(45.4) 1 4(50) 0.811 43(39.4) 25(38.5) 0.897 Dyspnoea 70(40.2) 1010(23.6) 0.001 19(33.3) 7(38.9) 44(45.4) 3(37.5) 0.529 45(41.3) 25(38.5) 0.713 Increasing lung markings 10(5.7) 134(3.1) 0.056 4(7) 1(5.6) 4(4.1) 1(12.5) 0.718 6( 202 3(2.8) 1(1.5) 0.605 Debilitation 6(3.4) 1103(25.8) 0.001 2(3.5) 1(5.6) 3(3.1) 0(0) 0.902 3(2.8) 3(4.6) 0.515 Vomiting 14(8.0) 326(7.6) 0.839 5(8.8) 2(11.1) 9(9.3) 0(0) 0.823 6(5.5) 8(12.3) 0.110 Poor appetite 27(15.5) 737 significant differences were seen between HPIV-positive and HPIV-negative patients for pharyngeal discomfort (p0.001), hoarseness (p=0.015), \u201cAbnormal pulmonary breathing sound\u201d (p0.001), \u201cDyspnoea\u201d (p0.001), \u201cPneumonia\u201d (p=0.01), and \u201cDiarrhoea\u201d (p0.001). the median age was 4.75 (interquartile range, 1.00 to 25.00) pathogens were detected in 2439/4755 (51.3%) samples. the pathogens identified most frequently were infA (833/4755; 17.5%), RSV (524/4755; 11.0%) and MP (274/4755; 5.8%) HBoV 103 7 0 3 1 3 10 0 2.2 EV 226 3 6 5 0 9 0 4.8 229E 35 6 2 0 1 0 0.7 OC43 88 2 0 1 1 0.7 HKU1 20 5 0 0.4 MP 274 0 5.8 CP 7 0.1 1 pathogen 35 7 66 4 726 171 392 107 125 57 124 13 43 14 8 196 5 44.0 2 pathogens the male to female ratio was 139:39 in HPIV-positive patients and 2759:1818 in HPIV-negative patients (p0.001). the child to adult ratio was 162:12 in HPIV-positive patients and 2627:1950 in HPIV-negative patients (p0.001). the vast majority of co-infections were in children (64/66; 97.0%), especially in patients under 5 years of age (63/66; 95.5%) the co-infection rate of HPIV-2 was 63.2% (12/19), the rate of HPIV-4 was 50% (4/8) the rate of HPIV-1 was 39.7% (23/58) and the rate of HPIV-3 was 33.3% (33/99) value HPIV-1 (n=57) HPIV-2 (n=18) HPIV-3 (n=97) HPIV-4 (n=8) p value Single HPIV (n=109) Co-pathogens (n=65) p value# Nasal obstruction 55(31.6) 1324(31.0) 0.862 20(35.1) 4(22.2) 31(32) 3(37.5) 0.767 34(31.2) 21(32.3) 0.878 Coryza 40(41.2) 4(50) 0.811 43(39.4) 25(38.5) 0.897 Dyspnoea 70(40.2) 1010(23.6) 0.001 19(33.3) 7(38.9) 44(45.4) 3(37.5) 0.529 45(41.3) 25(38.5) 0.713 Increasing lung markings 10(5.7) 134(3.1) 0.056 4(7) 1(5.6) 4(4.1) 1(12.5) 0(0) 0.202 3(2.8) 1(1.5) 0.605 Debilitation 6(3.4) 1103(25.8) 0.001 2(3.5) 1(5.6) 3(3.1) 0(0) 0.902 3(2.8) 3(4.6) 0.515 Vomiting 14(8.0) 326(7.6) 0.839 5(8.8) 2(11.1) 9(9.3) 0(0) 0.823 6(5.5) 8(12.3) 0.110 Poor appetite 27(15. significant differences were seen between HPIV-positive and HPIV-negative patients for pharyngeal discomfort (p0.001), hoarseness (p=0.015), \u201cAbnormal pulmonary breathing sound\u201d (p0.001), \u201cDyspnoea\u201d (p0.001), \u201cPneumonia\u201d (p=0.01), and \u201cDiarrhoea\u201d (p0.001). in this study, we analysed the characteristics of the four HPIV types in children and adults with ARTI in southern china over a 26 month period. of the pathogens investigated in this study, HPIVs were the sixth most frequently isolated. the predominant types were HPIV-3 and HPIV-1. co-infections were mostly found in children, especially in patients under 5 years of age. no significant differences in clinical presentation were seen between patients solely infected with HPIV and patients co-infected with HPIV and other respiratory pathogens. HPIVs can cause a spectrum of respiratory illness, and more \"hoarseness\" (p=0.015), \"abnormal pulmonary breathing sound\" (p0.001), \"dyspnoea\" (p0.001) presented in HPIV-positive patients than HPIV-negative patients suggesting pathogenic activity of HPIV in gastrointestinal illness. infections were common for the four HPIV types. no significant differences were seen in clinical presentation between patients solely infected with HPIV and patients co-infected with HPIV. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
