{"summary": "ISAV causes a multisystemic disease responsible for severe losses in salmon aquaculture. to approach this, we compared global gene expression using microarrays in fish dying early and late in the time course following infection from a highly pathogenic ISAV. the most susceptible individuals were characterized by high viral replication and dramatic activation of innate immune responses. the ability to endure high levels of infection for sustained periods could be associated with lower inflammatory responses. subsequent protection and viral clearance was most likely conferred by activation of adaptive immunity. survival during natural and experimental infections by any particular virus isolate can range from 0\u2013100% and varies significantly between families. the presence of a genetic component for disease resistance is strong evidence for the existence of protective antiviral responses. pathogen challenge enables identification of the most resistant individuals. however, infected fish may become carriers of pathogens. survival time is commonly used as an estimate of susceptibility and resistance in pathogen challenge tests. the chosen ISAV strain (Glesvaer 2/90) is well characterized and is classified among isolates inducing acute disease progression. a cumulative mortality (CM) of 84% in the cohabitant fish confirms the highly pathogenic nature of this ISAV strain. IM and LM stages were determined by real-time qPCR analysis of viral RNA in all tissues. this is a very sensitive and precise assay, reported to be 100-fold more sensitive than end-point RT-PCR [15]. low standard deviations of CT (cycle threshold) values within each stage indicated that viral RNA levels were similar between individuals. genes with differential expression between EM and LM from microarray analyses were verified by real-time qPCR on individual spleen samples. additional genes for adaptive immune responses not represented on the microarray were analysed on individual spleen samples (n = 6). early mortalities show induced innate antiviral and stress responses. similar profiles were seen in src-related tyrosine-protein kinase FRK and ligand for Lck SH2 domain p62 which regulate various immune responses. further downstream, up-regulation of several IFN-responsive genes involved in antigen processing and presentation indicated an early activation of adaptive immunity in EM. liver, spleen, heart and spleen are highlighted with orange and green scales. NS means not significant (p 0.01, t-test, 6 spot replicates per gene) qPCR analysis of early induced genes in heart from EM and LM. the CD84 leukocyte antigen is highly expressed in certain B-cell subsets. it belongs to the recently discovered family of signaling lymphocyte activating molecule (SLAM)-related receptors (SRR), a group of surface molecules whose main function seems to be the fine-tuning of lymphocyte responses. mu chain C region membrane-bound), Ssa.78 (similar to Ig-kappa chain V-III region HIL), Omy.416 (similar to Ig-kappa chain V-IV region JI), Omy.23312 (similar to Ig-kappa chain V-IV region B17-1), Omy.30091 (similar to Ig-kappa chain V-IV region Len) and Omy.11287 (similar to Ig-mu heavy all qPCRs were replicated three times in both the reverse transcription step and in PCR, giving identical results. the pronounced reduction in virus load from IM to LM might be explained by both developing antibody responses (IgZ) and activation of T-cell mediated immunity at IM, either through a specific CD8+ cytotoxic and/or TH1 response. liver from LM compared to EM (Table 1). Chaperones are essential for the life cycle of viruses. they are involved in replication, translation, transport and assembly of viral proteins. all mean log(ER) were significantly lower in LM (p 0.001, t-test, n = 12). in liver ISAV also affected genes involved in steroid and lipid metabolism. genes EM LM-EM CCAAT/enhancer binding protein delta1 -0,26 0,19 -1,07 0,20 -0.81 Leukotriene B4 receptor1,2 -1,17 0,11 -1,85 0,16 -0.68 Carboxylesterase HU1a1 -0,48 0,11 -1,42 0,37 -0.94 Delta-6 fatty acid desaturase -1,16 0,11 -1,04 0,19 0.12 saturase2 -0,98 0,16 -1,27 0,09 -0.29 5-lipoxygenase activating protein1,2 0,34 0,14 1,55 0,32 1.21 Annexin A11,2 -0,16 0,09 1,59 0,55 1.75 1Significant difference between groups (p 0.05, t-test, n = 12) four genes (5-lipoxygenase activating protein, cytochrome P450 2K4, galectin-9 and annexin A1) were determined as the minimum number required to build the function that ensured robust class prediction. three of four genes were related to metabolism of eicosanoids which are inflammatory regulators of lipid origin.

PCR efficiency was determined from tenfold serial dilutions of cDNA for each primer pair and calculated according to Rasmussen. each pair of primers was tested on different samples in the same plate to ensure optimal reproducibility. four potential reference genes were tested using the bestKeeper software. the CT method adjusted for E. Statistics was calculated using Unistat version 5.5 (Unistat, London, UK) differences between groups were analyzed with ANOVA with subsequent Newman-Keuls test. standardized tissue sampling was performed from 12, 24 and 12 moribund fish from respectively EM (0\u201310% CM), IM (35\u201355% CM) and LM (75\u201384% CM) stages. samples were immediately stored in >10 excess volume of RNAlater (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 4\u00b0C overnight following -20\u00b0C until RNA extraction. microarray analyses were conducted on fish from EM and LM stages. a common reference design of hybridization was applied and RNA pooled from 6 uninfected fish per tissue and per stage was used as control. hardt's, 3 SSC, 0.3% SDS, 0.67 g l-1 polyadenylate and 1.4 g l-1 yeast tRNA were washed at room temperature in 0.5 SSC and 0.1% SDS for 15 min, and twice in 0.06 SSC for 2 and 1 min respectively. the low quality spots were excluded from analysis and genes presented with less than three high quality spots on a slide were discarded. PCR efficiency was determined from tenfold serial dilutions of cDNA for each primer pair and calculated according to Rasmussen [53] each pair of primers was tested on different samples in the same plate to ensure optimal reproducibility. repeated testing was performed on whole template setup or random selection of samples to ensure inter-assay reproducibility. the design of analyses and numbers of samples are indicated in Table 3. eight genes were chosen for the development of predictors based on results from microarray analyses of the liver."}
