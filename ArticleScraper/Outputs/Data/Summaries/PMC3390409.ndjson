{"summary": "most degradation is carried out by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) ubiquitin is added to proteins by a cascade of ubiquitin conjugating enzymes. a polyubiquitinated protein is subsequently degraded by the 26S proteasome. many viruses have co-opted the UPS for their own benefit. the SV40 large T antigen inhibits the SCFfbw7 ubiquitin ligase to increase cyclin E levels. influenza virus NS1 inhibits TRIM 25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I. emia virus, human papillomavirus, human hepatitis B virus, parapoxvirus, and HCMV have been reported to regulate the function of the APC [17]\u2013[24]. HCMV promotes cell cycle progression likely in part by inactivating Rb [6], [26] and regulating the APC [24], [27], [28] mutant virus in which the viral ability to regulate the APC is abrogated by both alanine substitution of proline-arginine residues in pUL21a and UL97 deletion is markedly more defective compared to the pUL97 deletion virus alone. this suggests HCMV has evolved an invasive strategy of using both viral factors to regulate the APC to facilitate its infection. electrophoresis analysis revealed multiple protein bands specific to the pUL21a-containing sample. pUL21a interacts with the APC. MRC-5 cells were infected with ADgfp or ADgfpUL21a. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing gfpUL21awt or gfpUL21astop. cell lysates and eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting. PCNA and pUL44 were used as cellular and viral negative controls. pUL21a binds to the APC complex even though the exact subunit where pUL21a directly interacts remains unknown. we performed co-immunoprecipitation assays on lysates from cells infected with wild-type virus (ADgfp) infected cells were treated with proteasome inhibitor, MG132, as pUL21a was highly unstable and otherwise could not accumulate to levels allowing reproducible detection of this interaction. pUL21a interacts with the APC and does not require other HCMV proteins for this interaction to occur. sequence alignment of pUL21a with its homologues in chimpanzee CMV (CCMV) and Rhesus CMV (RhCMV) revealed a highly conserved N-terminus (residues 1\u201347), divergent middle region (residues 48\u201383) and C-terminus that contained several conserved residues pUL21a truncation mutant proteins were expressed in 293T cells by transfection. cells were collected at 72 hours, and lysates were immunoprecipitated with GFP antibody. cells were infected with recombinant HCMV virus carrying the UL21aPH-AA or UL21aPR-AA point mutant. ed proline-histidine pair at residues 111\u2013112 (PH111-112AA) were stable and were efficiently pulled down by the GFP antibody. only the PR109-110AA mutant lost the ability to bind to the APC. to validate the result in context of infection, we constructed recombinant HCMV viruses expressing GFP-tagged or native forms of PR109-110AA or PH111-112AA pUL21a variants. proteins were markedly reduced during wild-type infection. pUL21a-deficient virus fails to express late viral genes due to defect in viral DNA synthesis. pUL21a binding to the APC promotes proteasomal degradation. MRC-5 cells were infected with ADgfp, ADsubUL21a, ADpmUL21aPH-AA, or ADpmUL21aPR-AA. cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with APC3 antibody. pUL21a, IE1-72, and actin were used as infection and loading controls. APC10 associates with APC2 and APC11 of the ligase subcomplex. but its location in the inner cavity of the APC allows for contact with APC3 and APC6 of the specificity arm. total levels of APC3 and APC10 were similar to those in cells infected with ADpmUL21aPH-AA. pUL21a-mediated degradation of APC4 and APC5 is independent of APC8. this suggests that pUL21a-mediated degradation of APC4 and APC5 is independent of APC8. MG132 largely restored substrate levels during UL21a deletion viral infection. pUL21a regulates APC activity during HCMV infection. MRC-5 cells were infected with ADgfp or ADsubUL21a. cell lysates were collected at 72 hpi and analyzed by immunoblotting. results were reproducible in two independent experiments. one-fifth or one-tenth equivalent of lysate from ADgfp-infected cells at 24 or 72 hpi, respectively, was loaded on the SDS-PAGE to differentiate the migration patterns of Cdh1. pUL97-mediated phosphorylation of the APC coactivator Cdh1 appears intact even without pUL21a during HCMV infection. we predicted increased APC activity in the absence of pUL21a would not compromise the ability of HCMV to arrest infected cells. pUL21a protein accumulation was only detected in the presence of tetracycline. the addition of tetracycline significantly reduced APC4 and APC5 protein levels in cells expressing pUL21aPH-AA. in the absence of tetracycline, cells readily progressed through the mitotic phase following release. pUL21a expression is sufficient to regulate APC activity. cells carrying pUL21aPH-AA (+/ tetracycline) were treated with nocodazole for 16 hours. pUL21a-mediated APC regulation on HCMV replication in fibroblasts. we first tested if the ability of pUL21a to regulate the APC would be responsible for its previously reported role in promoting viral DNA replication. we compared the growth of ADpmUL21aPR-AA mutant virus to that of wild-type, ADpmUL21aPH-AA (i.e. pUL21a APC-binding competent), or UL21a deletion viruses in multi abrogation of UL97 and pUL21a-APC binding site markedly reduced HCMV replication as compared to abrogation of UL97 alone. MRC-5 cells were infected with indicated recombinant viruses at an input genome number equivalent to 0.03 infectious units of wild type virus/cell. recombinant HCMV viruses ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL97 and ADpmul21aPR-AA/subUL97 grew slower than wild-type virus due to lack of the multifunctional pUL97 protein. both recombinant viruses grew slower than wild-type virus due to lack of the multifunctional pUL97 protein. however, reconstitution of ADpmul21aPR-AA/subUL97 that lacked pUL21a APC BAC transfection reconstituted both mutant viruses at similar efficiency. at 14 dpi, the titer of ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL117 was slightly lower than that of ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL117. growth of mutant virus carrying only the deletion tracked with ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL117, suggesting that the difference between the PH and PR mutants at 14 dpi is minimal. pUL21a acts with the Anaphase-Promoting Complex (APC) HCMV pUL21a. it is a 15 kDa, highly unstable protein that is expressed with early kinetics. this protein shares no significant homology with any known protein. the bands indicated with an arrow were identified as APC3 (100 kDa), APC7, and APC8 (both at 65 kDa) pUL21a interacts with the APC in HCMV infection. lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with mouse monoclonal antibodies. pGFP-UL21a and pGFP-UL44 were used as cellular and viral negative controls. we validated these interactions in HCMV infected cells by co-immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblot analysis. we also included lysate from cells infected with wild-type virus (ADgfp) as a negative control. pUL21a interacts with the APC and does not require other HCMV proteins for this interaction to occur. gfpUL21awt and gfpUL21astop were expressed at equal levels but only associated with APC3 or APC8. mutant UL21a proteins were expressed in 293T cells by transfection. mutants were immunoprecipitated by the GFP antibody. the carboxyl-terminus of pUL21a contains the APC binding domain. sates and eluted proteins were immunoprecipitated with alanine substitution. cells were infected with recombinant HCMV virus carrying the UL21aPH-AA or UL21aPR-AA point mutant. cells were collected at 48 hpi and lysates were immunoprecipitated with GFP. untagged pUL21aPH-AA, but not pUL21aPR-AA, was co-immunoprecipitated with APC3. untagged pUL21aPH-AA, but not pUL21aPR-AA, was co-immunoprecipitated with APC3 when stabilized by MG132. there was no appreciable difference in APC4 and APC5 transcript levels between wild-type and deletion virus infections. pUL21a-mediated loss of APC4 and APC5 was due to proteasomal degradation. ADpmUL21aPR-AA was unable to degrade APC4 and APC5. MRC-5 cells were infected with ADgfp, ADsubUL21a, ADpmUL21aPH-AA or ADpmUL21aPR-AA. MG132 was added at 6 hpi, cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with APC3 antibody. lysates and eluted proteins were analyzed at 20 hpi. 3 could not co-immunoprecipitate APC10 in cells infected with ADpmUL21aPR-AA. the integrity of the APC during ADpmUL21aPH-AA infection was largely restored upon addition of MG132. pUL21a might bind to APC8 to disrupt the structure of the APC leading to APC4 and APC5 degradation. pUL21a expression regulates APC activity during HCMV infection. pUL21a is required for elevated accumulation of APC substrate proteins. MRC-5 cells were infected with ADgfp or ADsubUL21a. MRC-5 cells were infected with ADgfp, ADsubUL21a, ADpmUL21aPH-AA or ADpmUL21aPR-AA in the presence or absence of MG132. cell lysates were collected at 20 hpi and analyzed by immunoblotting. results were reproducible in three independent experiments. shRNAs knock down APC8 or the coactivator Cdh1 to deplete APC activity. pUL21a association with the APC allows it to target APC4 and APC5 subunits for degradation to alter APC activity during infection. it is noteworthy that not all APC substrates were subject to pUL21a-mediated regulation. cells infected with wild type, ADpmUL21aPH-AA, or ADpmUL21aPR-AAvirus showed indistinguishable cell cycle profiles throughout infection. pUL21a is sufficient to reduce APC4 and APC5 protein levels and Alter APC Activity. the biological characteristics of pUL21a-expressing cells are therefore consistent with reduced APC activity. the addition of tetracycline significantly reduced APC4 and APC5 protein levels in cells expressing pUL21aPH-AA, but not pUL21astop or pUL21aPR-AA. pUL21a expression alone is sufficient to regulate APC activity in an inducible cell line. pUL21a lentivirus expressed pUL21aPH-AA, pUL21astop, or pUL21aPR-AA. pUL21a expression was induced by tetracycline treatment for 72 hours. pUL21a expression is sufficient to induce an M-phase cell cycle arrest. knockdown of Cdh1 and APC8 was unable to enhance UL21a-deletion virus replication. this suggests that pUL21a has at least two independent activities. one is to facilitate viral DNA replication via an unknown mechanism. the second activity is to regulate the APC whose impact on virus replication is not apparent under the aforementioned experimental conditions. MRC-5 cells were infected with indicated recombinant viruses at an input genome number equivalent to that of 0.03 infectious units of wild type virus/cell. production of cell-free virion DNA at indicated times was determined by qPCR analysis and normalized to input levels of ADpmUL21aPH-AA. the input value of ADgfp was set to 1. ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL97 that lacked pUL21a APC-binding activity was markedly slower than that of ADpmUL21aPH-AA/subUL97. at day 25 post transfection, cells transfected with the BAC clone of ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL97 showed nearly 100% of CPE indicated by virus-driven GFP expression. titers of ADpmUL21aPR-AA/subUL97 pUL97 and pUL21a regulatory activity of pUL21a are synthetically lethal to HCMV replication. the pUL97 viral kinase inhibits the APC co-activator Cdh1 by phosphorylation. pUL21a targets APC4 and APC5 for proteasome-dependent degradation. pUL21a is the viral factor that mediates APC disruption. it interacts with the APC and inducs proteasome-dependent degradation of APC4 and APC5. this is the first identified viral protein that modulates the APC in this manner. the regulation of the APC represents one such critical but complex viral regulatory strategy. a number of viral factors have been reported to regulate the APC during HCMV infection. a number of viral proteins have been reported to regulate the APC in overexpression. the UL97 kinase of HCMV has been shown to phosphorylate Cdh1 and partially inhibit the APC during infection but with unknown consequences for viral replication. pUL21a-APC binding and pUL97 attenuated viral replication relative to the loss of pUL97 alone. further experiments are needed to demonstrate the vital role of this regulation in HCMV replication. pUL21a is a highly unstable protein and likely degraded in a ubiquitin-independent manner. it is tempting to speculate that pUL21a may directly bind APC4 and APC5 to the proteasome. pUL21a targets proteins involved in cellular DNA synthesis, glycolysis and glutaminolysis, and cell cycle progression. several HCMV proteins contain a putative destruction Box motif. the APC may also promote ubiquitination and degradation of viral proteins to restrict infection. pUL21a-mediated regulation of the APC may also have broad impact on cancer. pYD-C235 is a pLPCX-derived retroviral vector (Clontech) that expresses a DsRed gene driven by an internal ribosome entry site 2 (IRES2). pYD-C474 was created by PCR amplifying the coding sequence of the pGFP-UL21a fusion protein from pADgfpUL21a and ligating it into the multiple cloning site of YD-C665, YD-C667, and YD-C669 are lentiviral expression vectors created by cloning the UL21astop, UL21aPH-AA, and UL21aPR-AA sequences into the multiple cloning site of YD-C649. to produce pLKO-based lentiviruses, 293T cells were transfected with corresponding pLKO vectors along with packaging primary antibodies used in this study included anti-actin (AC-15, Abcam); anti-HA (HA.11, Covance); anti-GFP (AF3.1, Santa Cruz and 610454, BD); anti-APC8 (AF3.1, Santa Cruz and 610454, BD); anti-APC4 (A301-176A, Bethyl laboratories); anti-geminin (DH01, Calbiochem); anti-UL21a [29]. pADgfpUL21a was used to produce UL21a-deletion virus ADsubUL21a. pADsubul21a carried a galK/kanamycin dual mutagenic cassette in place of UL21a coding sequence. pADpmUL21aPR-AA carried point mutation PR109-110AA or PH111-112AA in the GFP tagged or native UL21a gene. HCMV infection For most infections, subconfluent MRC-5 cells in serum-containing medium were inoculated with recombinant HCMV virus at an input genome number equivalent to that of 3\u20135 infectious units of wild type virus/cell for 1 hour. for shRNA knockdown experiments, subconfluent MRC-5 cells were transduced with lentivirus for 24 hours, infected as described above, and maintained in serum-free media throughout the infection. cells were cleared by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 minutes. supernatants were incubated with protein A-coated Dynabeads. beads were washed with PBS and immunoprecipitated protein complexes were eluted by boiling beads. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA with random hexamer primers. cDNA was quantified using SYBR Advantage qPCR Premix. cDNA from infected cells was used to generate a standard curve for each gene examined. pYD-C580 was created by PCR amplifying the coding sequence of pGFP-UL21a fusion protein from pADgfpUL21a. vectors expressing pGFP-UL21a truncation mutants were derived from pYD-C474 and point mutants were derived from pYD-C474. pYD-C160, pYD-C175, and pYD-C682 are pRetro-EBNA derived retroviral expression vectors that expressed GFP, UL21a, and UL21astop. pYD-C648 and pYD-C649 are pLKO-based lentiviral vectors expressing GFP-TetR and carrying the CMV-TetO2 promoter. MRC-5 cells were transduced with pLKO-based lentivirus expressing shRNA against the targeted gene for 48 hours. the shRNA sequence for Cdh1 knockdown was 5\u2032CCAGTCAGAACCGGAAAGCCA3\u2032 and the shRNA sequence for APC8 knockdown was 5\u2032GCAGGAGGTAATATGCTATAA3\u2032. pAD-GFP, which carried the GFP-tagged genome of the HCMV AD169 strain, was used to produce wild-type virus ADgfp [45] pADsubUL21a, which carried an N-terminally GFP-tagged version of pUL21a, was used to produce ADgfpUL21a virus [29] pADsubUL21a carried point mutation PR109-110AA or PH111-112AA in the GFP tagged or native UL pADpmUL21aPR-AA, pADpmUL21aPH-AA, and pADsubUL117 carried mutagenic cassette. all BACs were confirmed by restriction digestion, PCR, and sequencing. HCMV virus titers were determined in duplicate in HFFs by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) assay or plaque assay. DNA was extracted with phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol and precipitated with ethanol. protein bands specific to immunoprecipitated pUL21a complex were excised for identification by MS/MS mass spectrometry. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA with random hexamer primers. cDNA was quantified using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit. the standard curve was then used to calculate the relative amount of specific RNA present in a sample. cells were trypsinized, fixed, and permeabilized in ice-cold 70% ethanol overnight. total or pUL44-positive cells were determined for their DNA content by cell-cycle analysis with flow-cytometry. percentages of cells in each cell cycle compartment were calculated using cellQuest or FlowJo software. MRC-5 cells were infected with ADgfp or ADsubUL21a. MG132 was added to the final concentration of 10 M at 6 hpi. both cell lysates and eluted proteins were analyzed by immunoblotting.
