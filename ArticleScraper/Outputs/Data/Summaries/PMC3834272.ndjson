{"summary": "mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) has been reported as a target to regulate macrophage polarization. the present work was designed to investigate the therapeutic potential of MR antagonism in bleomycin-induced acute lung injury and fibrosis. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, progressive, interstitial fibrotic lung disease characterized by chronic lung inflammation, disruption of alveolar structure, interstitial fibroblast proliferation, and excessive extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition. novel therapies capable of targeting inflammation without compromising body\u2019s immunity can still be a challenge in this area. macrophages from mice lacking myeloid mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) exhibit a transcription profile that mimic alternatively activated macrophages, and are protected against angiotensin II (AngII) induced cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis [16]. this work provides evidence indicating that MR in mononuclear phagocytes might be a potential target for therapeutic purpose. circulating monocytes were purified from peripheral blood using a magnetic bead-based kit. the purity of enriched monocytes was confirmed by flow cytometry. the purified monocytes and cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were seeded on glass slides. images were visualized by a fluorescence microscope (Eclipse 80i, Nikon, Tokyo, Japan) the unstained samples and samples stained with the secondary antibody without incubation with primary antibodies were used as negative controls. animals were randomly allocated into four treatment groups. smooth muscle actin (-SMA, 1:600, A2547, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis. MO, USA) immunofluorescent staining was carried out as previously described. fibrosis and collagen was determined from 10 non-overlapping fields by using digital quantitative analysis. flow cytometry analysis Cells from blood, BALF and lungs were subject flow cytometry analysis on a Cytomics FC500 cytometer (Beckman Coulter, Miami, FL, USA) all antibodies were obtained from Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA) all data were analyzed with FlowJo software (Treestar, Ashland, OR, USA) the cells were incubated with anti-mouse F4/80-PE-Cy5 (clone BM8), anti-mouse CD11c-PE-Cy7 (clone N418) and anti-mouse CD206-PE (clone C068C2). flow cytometry analysis was carried out for immunophenotypic analysis of interstitial macrophages. total RNA (2 g) was reverse-transcribed into the cDNA using a reverse transcription assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. real-time PCR was performed with SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) on an ABI Prism 7300 sequence detection system in triplicate and according to a two-step PCR protocol. chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the BALF were measured by commercially available ELISA kits. a two-tailed P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. circulating monocytes and alveolar macrophages were purified from peripheral blood using a magnetic bead-based kit. the purity of enriched monocytes was confirmed by flow cytometry. the purified monocytes and cells from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were seeded on glass slides for immunohistological detection of MR. mice were lightly anesthetized by inhalation of ether. bleomycin A5 (2.5mg/kg body weight in 40l saline) was administered by oropharyngeal instillation. animals were randomly allocated into four treatment groups. cell pellet was resuspended in 0.9% saline for total cell counts, differential cell counts, immunohistochemical staining, and flow cytometry analysis. cell pellet was resuspended in sterile 0.9% saline for total cell counts, differential cell counts, and immunohistochemical staining. a 20% p-Dimethylaminobenzaldehyde solution (dissolved in 3.15 N perchloric acid) was added to each sample. the mixture was incubated at 60\u00b0C for 15 minutes. all antibodies were obtained from Biolegend (San Diego, CA, USA) cell suspension was stained with anti-mouse F4/80-PE-Cy5 (clone BM8), anti-mouse CD11c-PE-Cy7 (clone N418) and anti-mouse CD206-PE (clone C068C2). flow cytometry analysis was carried out. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Total RNA (2 g) was reverse-transcribed into the cDNA using a reverse transcription assay (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) in 25 L of reaction volume according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the primer sequences are shown in Table 1. Arg-1, arginase-1, Col I, collagen type I; Col III, collagen type III; CCL2, chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) in the BALF were measured by commercially available ELISA kits (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) MR is expressed in circulating monocytes and alveolar macrophages. results suggest that MR is expressed in mouse mononuclear phagocytes. mRNA expression was further validated by immunofluorescent staining. spironolactone treated lungs showed decreased total cell, macrophage, lymphocyte, neutrophil infiltration and esosinophils in alveoli. spironolactone treated lungs showed decreased total cell, macrophage, lymphocyte, neutrophil infiltration and esosinophils. spironolactone treatment was associated with downregulated CCL2/MCP-1, TGF-1 and IL-1 both at the mRNA and the protein levels. markers for M2 polarization, such as arginase-1 (Arg-1) mRNA level in lung tissue, and IL-4 protein content in BALF were downregulated by spironolactone. mr antagonism was associated with reduced collagen deposition and -SMA positive cells (myofibroblasts) spironolactone treatment could partially regress bleomycin-induced collagen expression upregulation, which was consistent with the histological findings. Spironolactone treatment could significantly reduce bleomycin-induced circulating Ly6Chi monocytosis. the reciprocal changes of bleomycin-induced circulating Ly6Chi monocytosis are shown in Figure 6C. spironolactone partially normalizes bleomycin-induced alveolar macrophage M2 polarization. spironolactone partially normalizes bleomycin-induced alveolar macrophage M2 polarization. gating strategies for mouse pulmonary alveolar macrophages using lung lavage.

MR is expressed in purified murine circulating Ly6G-/CD11b+ monocytes and in F4/80+ alveolar macrophages. in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a skewing of alveolar macrophages from an M1 to M2 phenotype has been observed. in an endotoxin-induced lung inflammation model, Maus and coworkers showed an increased exudate macrophages and their progenitors, Ly6Chi monocytes, both exhibiting M2 polarization in alveoli. spironolactone exerts major pharmacological effect on circulating monocyte pool. monocyte infiltration would facilitate alveolar neutrophil emigration. suppression of Ly6Chi monocytosis would concomitantly lead to decreased tissue accumulation of neutrophils. spironolactone has been shown to attenuate experimental pulmonary hypertension via MR inhibition in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells. spironolactone has been shown to attenuate experimental pulmonary hypertension via MR inhibition in pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells [63], a commonly encountered technical issue. alterations in alveolar macrophage polarization state cannot be ascribed to MR antagonist\u2019s direct effect. suppression of inflammatory monocyte expansion should be the direct effect by spironolactone, which ameliorates lung injury via the \u201cLy6Chi directed pulmonary alterative activation\u201d mechanism."}
