{"summary": "TEXT Mycoplasma genitalium is an emerging pathogen. it has been clearly associated with lower genital tract infection and disease in men and women. there are data highly suggestive of a role in upper genital tract disease in women such as pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) sensitivity, specificity, and strain inclusivity of the Aptima M. genitalium and the 3 alternate tests were determined using 9 M. genitalium laboratory strains and a variety of nontarget organisms. clinical performance was assessed by testing residual vaginal swabs plus female and male urine specimens from 1,400 adult subjects. industry has been developing new assays for decades. trachomatis infection is the most common bacterial sexually transmitted pathogen. the disease is an important cause of urethritis in men. in the 1990s, NAATs were introduced for detection of C. trachomatis infection of the genital tract and found many more positive results than were seen with either cell culture or antigen detection methods. the test evaluators felt the bias was small and that it was more important to avoid the misclassification of up to 35% of the NAAT positive results. a real specificity of 90% to 92% would mean false positives could easily occur at a rate in excess of the C. trachomatis prevalence in the populations being screened. a real specificity of 90% to 92% would mean that false positives could easily occur at a rate in excess of the prevalence in the populations being screened. this is not consistent with the biology of C. trachomatis infections. some women are infected in one anatomic site and not at another. a woman could be infected at just the urethra but not the cervix or vice versa. this is not consistent with the biology of C. trachomatis infections."}
