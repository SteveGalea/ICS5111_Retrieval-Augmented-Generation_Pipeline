{"summary": "Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis) is the causative agent of plague that has killed over an estimated 200 million people in previous pandemics. the current incidence of plague is low but the animal reservoirs for Y. pestis exist worldwide. current treatment for plague consists of antibiotics, while a live attenuated vaccine against plague is used in the former Soviet Union for prevention. the immune response against the mouse mAb is to humanize the mAb for use in humans. we describe the isolation of three mAbs from a large naive human phage-displayed Fab library. one, designated as m252, is against the F1- antigen and the other two (m253, m254) are against the V-antigen. mutational rate ranged from zero to less than 10%. this is typical for antibodies isolated from nave human libraries by panning against viruses causing acute infection. this contrasts to neutralizing antibodies selected from immune human libraries by panning against HIV-1. the three human anti-plague Fabs were used in competition-ELISAs against a panel of mouse anti-plague mAbs. the mouse anti-plague mAbs included the anti-F1 mAb F1-04-A-G1 and five anti-V mAbs. the competition between the human anti-V m252 Fab and the mouse anti-V mAbs was also minimal. epitope binding analysis of human Fab by competition-ELISA. a and B, Fab anti-V m253 and m254 binding to the V-antigen were analysed by competitions with equal amount of control IgG1, mouse anti-Burkholderia mallei (Bm), and five other mouse anti-V mAbs. the binding by human anti-V m253 mAb resulted in a strong signal with peptide 2 and a weak signal with peptide 1. the binding by human anti-V m254 mAb, did not bind to any of the peptides, suggesting that its epitope may be conformational. each of twenty-seven peptides that covered the full length of the F1-antigen were used to coat an ELISA plate. binding by the human anti-F1 m252 mAb (0.05 ml of a 10 g/ml solution) was analyzed. the expression of the F1-antigen is regulated by temperature (37\u00b0C) the human anti-V m254 mAb showed minor binding to the Y. pestis grown at 37\u00b0C. a mouse IgG1 isotype control mAb, which did not show binding to the whole-cells, was included to show binding. mouse anti-B mallei IgG1 (panel A) was used as a nonspecific isotype control. binding by the human anti-F1 mAb (m252) to Y. pestis (panel D) was considered to be the result of autofluoresence because it was seen in both phase contrast and fluorescent microscopy. the human anti-V mAbs, m253 and m254, did not show any significant protection when used together in the murine bubonic plague model. the mouse anti-F1 (F1m) and anti-V (7.3 m) control mAbs both passively protected all (6/6) mice under the same challenge conditions (MTD of 6.8 days, 0/6 survivors) the following mAbs and amounts were used: NMS, 500 g; F1m, 500 g; m252, 500 g; m253+ m254, 500 g each; m252+ m254+ m254, 500 g each. the same number of survivors was obtained (6/6) whether mice were given only mouse F1m mAb or F1m combined with the nonspecific Hu-IgG1 mAb. human m252 mAb was combined with the nonspecific Hu-IgG1 mAb. this variation in the number of survivors was not different than previously. a nonspecific human IgG1 antibody (Hu-IgG1) had little effect on the mean-time-to-death (MTD) the level of human anti-F1 and anti-V mAbs may not have been sustained in the mouse over time compared to the mouse IgG mAbs. a human IgG molecule would have an average serum half -life of 21 days in a human. the data shown are averages from three mice for each IgG. the amount of remaining human anti-F1 m252 and anti-V m254 in mouse serum. we then administered the human m252 mAb at different time points. the numbers behind each antibody represent the time in days in which the antibody was administered (500 g) to mice relative to the day of challenge (day 0) the two numbers after the human anti-F1 m252 (1 and +5) represent two different days when the mAb (500 g) was added to the same group of mice relative to the day of challenge. anti-F1 human antibody m252 and anti-V human antibodies m253 and m254 were expressed as Fabs, purified, and analyzed on a reducing SDS-PAGE gel. C. Specific binding by the Fabs antibody fragments to their respective antigens in an ELISA assay. gue mAbs included the anti-F1 mAb F1-04-A-G1 and five anti-V mAbs, which included the anti-V mAb 7.3 m that was highly protective. however, we observed some weak competition between the human anti-V m254 Fab antibody and some of the mouse anti-V mAbs that we did not see with the human anti-V mAbs. anti-V m253 and m254 binding to the V-antigen were analysed by competitions with equal amount of control IgG1, mouse anti-Burkholderia mallei (Bm), and five other mouse anti-V mAbs. the amount of bound human Fab was then determined. the amount of bound human Fab was then determined. the binding by human anti-V m253 mAb resulted in a strong signal with peptide 2 and a weak signal with peptide 1. the anti-V m254 mAb did not bind to any of the peptides. this suggests that its epitope may be conformational. each of fifty-two peptides that covered the full length of the V- antigen was used to coat an ELISA plate. the human anti-V m253 (B) and m254 (C) mAbs were used (0.05 ml of a 10 g/ml solution), respectively, to analyze for binding. isotype control mAb was included to show binding by the mouse and human anti-F1 mAbs was antibody specific. Neither the human anti-V m254 mAb nor mouse anti-V mAbs showed significant binding to Y. pestis whole-cells. human anti-F1 and anti-V mAbs protect synergistically against a Y. pestis challenge in a bubonic plague model. the human anti-F1 and anti-V mAbs were used either separately or together in different combinations. only the human anti-F1(m252) mAb showed some efficacy. human anti-F1 and anti-V mAbs were given i.p. to mice 24 hrs before parenteral challenge with Y. pestis CO92. the number of surviving mice for each treatment group was monitored for 21 days. we injected five groups of mice with the following mAbs. one group of mice with only a nonspecific human IgG1 mAb (Hu-IgG1, 1500 g); another group with the mouse anti-F1 mAb (m252, 500 g); another group of mice with the human anti-F1 mAb (m252, 500 g) a nonspecific human IgG1 antibody (Hu-IgG1) had little effect on the mean-time-to-death (MTD) and number of surviving mice that received the human anti-F1 mAb. the nonspecific human IgG1 antibody (Hu-IgG1) had little effect on the mean-time-to-death (MTD) and number of surviving mice that received the human anti-F1 mAb. the anti-F1 m252 mAb appeared to have a half-life of approximately 8 days, and the half-life of m253 mAb was approximately 10 days. after 21 days, the levels of both the mouse anti-F1 (F1m) and anti-V (7.3 m) mAbs were undetectable. mAb 24 and 48 hours post-challenge provided increased protection. antibody administration at even later time points was not performed. however, we did evaluate the effect of a second dose of antibody at a later time point. the development of antibody-based therapies is struggling to keep pace with the emergence of drug resistant bacterial strains, for example as in Y. pestis [6] there has been an intense interest in developing antibody-based therapies as an alternative method of treatment. in this report we described the first isolation of fully human mAbs against the Y. pestis virulence factors F1- and V-antigens. the human anti-plague mAbs appeared to bind to the same region as the mouse antiF1. the human m252 mAb was as protective as the mouse anti-F1 mAb. a possible minor, secondary neutralizing epitope exists near the amino-terminal region of the V-antigen [14]. the minor competition between the human anti-V Fab antibody and the mouse anti-V antibodies suggests that the recognition site of the human anti-V antibodies is slightly different or they may partially share conformational binding site. this may be directly related to the presence of F1 antigen on the surface of the plague organism. anti-V antibodies enhance phagocytosis through possibly the Fc receptor. they block Yop delivery into the host cell, preventing Ysc dependent TTSS injection of V-antigen into the host cell. this suggests that the presence of V-antigen on the surface of the cell may be dependent on contact with the eukaryotic host cell. a Y. pestis pgm- strain used in the challenge studies was originally obtained from a human case of pneumonic plague. it was isolated from the sputum of a human case of pneumonic plague. anti-V mouse mAb 7.3 (7.3 m) was obtained from silvia Trevino (USAMRIID) all mice mAbs were IgG1 isotypes. the human mAb used in the passive protection study was an anti-human IGFII mAb. monoclonal ELISA was then performed to select positive clones. clones displaying an OD405>2.0 were selected for plasmid preparation and sequencing. expression, purification, conversion to IgG1, and generation of stable clones were transformed into E.coli strain HB2151 for expression [36] three human anti-plague IgG1s cloned into pDR12 vectors and transfected into CHO-K1 cells. one day after transfection, the cells were re-plated and subjected to selection in GMEM medium supplemented with 25 M MSX. two weeks later, the clones were amplified further. studies between the mouse mAbs and human Fabs the antigen at 2 g/ml (F1-protein or V-antigen) were used to coat 96-well plates. the plates were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. a blocking solution (1% bovine serum albumin with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS) was added. Y. pestis pgm- was first streaked onto a sheep-blood agar plate. a single colony was picked and inoculated into 10 ml of heart infusion Broth. cells grown overnight (o/n) at RT with rigorous shaking. the next day, an aliquot of the bacteria culture was shifted to 37\u00b0C. the growth of Y. pestis pgm- and the sample preparation for binding by human or mouse anti-F1 or anti-V mAbs was identical as that for the FACS analysis. a Nikon T-2000 fluorescent microscope was used for detection. mice were approved by the IACUC at the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, animal protocol number AP-07-040. half-life of human or mouse anti-F1 and anti-V mAbs given passively to mice was detected by the addition of goat-anti-human or goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP. peptides Y. pestis purified F1,V, and F1-V [34] protein antigens were obtained from Brad Powell (USAMRIID, Fort Detrick, Frederick, MD) the 27-peptide array that covered the F1-antigen were 14- to 17-mers with 11 or 12 amino acid overlaps. the 53-peptide array that covered the F1-antigen were 15- to 17-mers with 11 or 12 amino acid overlaps. biotin-labeled bead format panning was performed according to manufacturer's recommended protocol. 1012 Fabs displayed on surface of phage were suspended in PBS with 2% dry milk and applied to wells coated with the F1- or V- proteins. each well was washed 5 times for the first round and 10 times for the subsequent four rounds of selection. a single clone was inoculated into 2YT supplemented with 100 units of ampicillin and 0.2% glucose. the culture was shifted to 30\u00b0C with shaking and incubated overnight. cells were then collected, and lysed with polymyxin B (Sigma, St Louis) in PBS. for small scale production, stable clones were generated using CHO-K1 cells. human anti-F1 and anti-V Fabs and IgGs were coated to a 96-well plate. the next day, the plate was blocked with 2% dry milk in PBS. anti-His-horse radish peroxidase (HRP) was added to each plate and incubated for another hour. a streptavidin-conjugated HRP was added for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C, before adding a hydrogen peroxidase-3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine solution. the color reaction was allowed to develop at room temperature for 15 min and read at 450 nm. the peptides were added to the plates in 0.05 ml per well at 25 g/ml. 10 L of bacterial cells was mixed with 90 L of Fc Block solution to achieve a final density of 1107 cells/ml. human or mouse IgGs were added to the bacterial cell suspension to a final concentration of 10 g/ml. cells were collected by centrifugation and suspended in 1 ml of PBS. the challenge dose was prepared from frozen stocks of Y. pestis CO92 that were streaked on tryptose blood agar slants and incubated at 28\u00b0C for 48 h. the slants were rinsed with 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH 7.0, and cell density adjusted to the required density with the same buffer. administration of the mAb was made in 1X PBS with 1% BSA and 0.05% tween-20. the amount of human or mouse anti-F1 or anti-V mAb binding to the antigens was detected by the addition of goat-anti-human or goat-anti-mouse IgG conjugated to HRP (Southern Biotechnology)"}
