{"summary": "CEA is a glycosylated human oncofetal antigen that belongs to the CEA-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM) family of the immunoglobulin (Ig) gene superfamily [1], [2]. CEA is closely related to CEACAM1, CEACAM3, CEACAM4, CEACAM6, CEACAM7, and CEACAM8. anti-CEA Fab arcitumomab can be used as imaging reagents to specifically localize CEA-expressing solid cancers. anti-CEA radio-immunoconjugate antibodies have also been shown to be potentially efficacious for the treatment of patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. both subsets of T cells contribute to tumor cell killing at relatively low effector T cell:target tumor cell ratios [22], [29] both potentiate further T cell activation and proliferation, facilitating the subsequent engagement and killing of additional tumor cells bound by a BiTE antibody. MEDI-565 is composed of a humanized single-chain antibody recognizing human CEA connected by a short flexible linker to a single-chain antibody specific for CD3. MEDI-565 is currently in phase I clinical trials for the treatment of gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas. the CEA-specific arm of MEDI-565 is a humanized version of the murine antibody A5B7 [40], [41] the binding epitope of which is unknown [40], [42]. the plasmid containing the full-length CEA sequence was purchased from Open Biosystems. plasmid containing sequences of the CEA splice variant was purchased from ImaGenes GmbH. cloned into puromycin resistance lentiviral vector pCDH1-HCS1-EF1-Puro. clones were sequence-verified using sequence-specific primers. cells expressing both the CEA splice variant and full-length CEA (CHO FL+SV CEA) were created by infecting CHO DHFR- cells with the pCDH1-CMV-MCS-EF1-Blast-CEA lentiviral vector followed by blasticidin selection. the anti-CEACAM5 specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) clone 26/3/13 was purchased from Genovac GmbH (Aldevron, Germany PNRT101 (Pancreatic Cancer), HLRT101 (lung cancer), and BCRT101 (breast cancer) were purchased from OriGene Technologies. each array contains cDNAs from 5 to 8 normal tissues and 19 to 42 cancer tissues. the tumor stage ranged from stage I to IV and the tumor tissues were comprised of 50\u201390% tumor. each blot was exposed to SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and exposed to BioMax MS Kodak film (Sigma) for detection of chemiluminescence resulting from bound anti-CEACAM5 antibody. equal amounts of protein loaded into each lane of the gel were controlled by detecting the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) protein using a full-length transcript removes exons 3 and 4 and a portion of exon 2 to create an alternative splice variant CEA transcript with 8 exons and 7 introns. boxes indicate exons and lines indicate introns (not drawn to scale) five deletion mutants were constructed by removing individual IgC-like domains. all mutants were expressed well as monitored by anti-CEA polyclonal antibody. MEDI-565 did not recognize any deletion mutants which lack the A2 domain (DelA1-A2 and DelA2) but bound well to all mutants which are comprised of the A2 domain (DelA1, DelB1 and DelB2-A3) expression vectors encoding the CEA deletion and swap mutants were transfected for expression of glycophosphatidyl inositol (GPI)-anchored proteins. one day prior to transfection, HEK293 F cells were seeded at a density of 0.7106 cells/mL. mutants that differ from those in the A3 domain were mutated in clusters or individually to encode the corresponding amino acids of the A3 domain. mutants were cloned into the mammalian expression vector pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen) for the full-length CEA assay we targeted the splice junctions of exons 2 and 5 exon to design the gene specific probe. all primer/probes were imported into the Primer Express software tool to ensure the optimal design for utilization in the TaqMan Gene Expression assay procedure. RNA was extracted from frozen slide sections of pancreatic tissue classified as normal (NAT, normal adjacent to tumor), adenocarcinoma, benign adenoma, or endocrine tumor. RNA purity and concentration were determined spectrophotometrically. cDNA samples were pre-amplified using the recommended program. Tissue cDNA arrays were used to determine the expression of full-length and CEA splice variant (CHO SV CEA) transcripts in normal and cancerous tissues of various stages and grades. cDNAs from CHO cells expressing either full-length CEA (CHO FL CEA) or the CEA splice variant (CHO SV CEA) were used. antibodies were incubated with CHO cells at a concentration of 10 g/mL. CHO cells were washed three times with PBS/2% FBS and incubated with 4 g/mL of an Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes at 4\u00b0C in the dark. CHO DHFR-, CHO FL CEA, CHO SV CEA and CHO FL+SV CEA cells were used as target cells and labeled with 3,3\u2032-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) cell labelling solution (Invitrogen) to distinguish them from effector T cells during flow cytometry analysis. cell lysis was monitored by cellular uptake of Propidium Iodide (PI) live cells exclude PI while dead cells do not. an LSRII flow cytometer was used to collect data and FlowJo software was used to analyze the data. cDNA cloned into puromycin resistance lentiviral vector pCDH1-HCS1-EF1-Puro (System Biosciences) using sequence-specific primers. the resulting clones were sequence-verified. CHO cells expressing the full-length CEA sequence (CHO FL CEA) were created by infecting CHO DHFR- cells with the pCDH1-CMV-MCS-EF1-Blast-CEA lentiviral vector. cells expressing both the full-length CEA sequence (CHO FL CEA) were created by infecting CHO DHFR- cells with the pCDH1-CMV-MCS-EF1-Blast-CEA four of the 20 pancreatic tumor tissue samples had matched normal adjacent pancreatic tissue samples. tumor stage ranged from stage I to IV and the tumor tissues were comprised of 50\u201390% tumor. protein from each gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane using an iBlot\u00ae Dry Blotting System (Invitrogen) and 2X NuPAGE\u00ae transfer buffer (Invitrogen) containing 20% methanol and blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (Sigma) in PBS pH 7.4. each blot was probed overnight with 1 g/mL of the CEACAM5-specific mAb clone 26/3/13 cDNA encoding the CEA deletion variants DelA1-A2, Del A1, DelB1, DelA2 and DelB2-A3 were assembled and amplified by overlapping extension polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using an in-house full-length CEA cDNA clone, pNEO human CEA-GPI, as a template. the full-length transcript (NCBI accession number NM002483) consists of 10 exons and 9 in ino acid sequence alignment of the full-length CEA (Swiss-Prot P06731-1) and CEA splice variant proteins are over-lined with alternating solid or dashed lines. the epitope regions (aa 326\u2013349 and 388\u2013410) are enclosed by black boxes. three segments, A, B, and C, were defined in the A2 and A3 domains to generate swap-mutants. truncated mutant A2 or A3 encodes the N-domain, the A2 or A3 domain, and the GPI region. all mutants were expressed well as monitored by anti-CEA polyclonal antibody. expression vectors encoding the CEA deletion and swap mutants were transfected. the cells were washed three times with PBS and incubated with 1 g/mL of an Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488-conjugated anti-penta-His antibody (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) for 30 minutes. expression of CEA deletion mutants was monitored with a goat anti-CEA polyclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN) mutants substituted clusters V388G389P390E392 and I408N410 of the A2 domain with the corresponding clusters of the A3 domain (KO_VGPE+IN), and grafted clusters F326T328N333, V388G389P390E392 and I408N410 of the A2 domain into the A3 domain (KI_FTN+VGPE+IN) all mutants were assembled by overlapping extension PCR using sequence of the forward primer 5\u2032-GAAACCCAGAACCCAGTGAGT-3\u2032. sequence of the reverse primer 5\u2032-CGCATACAGTGGTCGAGAGATAATA-3\u2032. cDNA samples were pre-amplified using TaqMan Pre-Amp Master Mix. pre-amplified cDNA was either used immediately or stored at 20\u00b0C until processed. samples and TaqMan Gene Expression assays were loaded onto a 96.96 dynamic array (Fluidigm) according to manufacturer's instructions. qPCR was carried out using an ABI 7900HT Fast Real Time PCR instrument. cDNAs from CHO cells expressing either full-length CEA (CHO FL CEA) or the CEA splice variant (CHO SV CEA) were used as a negative control for qPCR. CHO cells were washed three times with PBS/2% FBS and incubated with 10 g/mL of an Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen) all CHO cells were washed one time with PBS/2% FBS, resuspended in PBS/2% FBS containing 10 g/mL of PI. CHO SV CEA and CHO FL+SV CEA cells were labeled with 3,3\u2032-dioctadecyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) cell labelling solution. dilutions of MEDI-565 or Control BiTE were added to target and effector cells in 96-well non-tissue culture treated plates. CD8+ and CD4+ T cells were subdivided using a mouse anti-human CD8 mAb and a mouse anti-human CD4 mAb. T-cell activation (CD25 up-regulation) was monitored by the allophycoerytherin (APC)-conjugated mouse anti-human CD25 mAb. cell lines were co-cultured with enriched CD3+ T cells and the control BiTE antibody as described above. immunoglobulin constant (IgC)-like domains denoted A1, B1, A2, B2, and B3. mutants were transiently expressed as GPI-anchored proteins on HEK293 F cells. binding of MEDI-565 or anti-CEA polyclonal control antibody to each of the deletion mutants was analyzed using flow cytometry. swap mutants were generated by swapping segments A, B or C of the A3 domain into the A2 domain (KO mutants), or by swapping segments of the A3 domain into the A3 domain (KI mutants) MEDI-565 did not bind to any of the mutants lacking either the A or C segment of the A2 domain (KO_A, KO_C, KI_A, KI_B and KI_C, Figure 4B, C) the binding level of MEDI-565 was comparable to the signal of both the full-length CEA and the A2 deletion mutant. modeled structure of the A2 domain revealed that segment B was spatially distal from critical residue N333. amino acids of segments A and C of the A2 domain that differ from the A3 domains were replaced with the corresponding A3 residues encoding several substitutions at a time. d MEDI-565 binding significantly decreased the binding of MEDI-565 (F326 to A, T328 to A), suggesting that they were also involved in the interaction with MEDI-565 but to a lesser extent than residue N333. grafting only segment A that includes the F326, T328, and N333 residues of the A2 domain into the A3 domain (KI_A) did not result in MEDI-565 binding. mutating F326 or T328 to Ala reduced binding of MEDI-565. knocking-out the amino acids V388G389P390E392 and I408N410 together from the A2 domain also reduced MEDI-565 binding (KO_VGPE+IN) amino acids V388, G389, P390, E392, I408, and N410 in segment C of CEA could also be involved in MEDI-565 binding. some knock-out CEA variants exhibited an incorrect fold in or near the MEDI-565 epitope region, thereby losing their binding capacity. polymorphisms of CEA were surveyed using the NCBI single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) database. two non-synonymous coding SNPs of CEA (rs10407503, rs7249230) were identified in the binding epitope of MEDI-565. the single-nucleotide C to A change in the SNP rs10407503 resulted in the amino acid change of a single splice variant (NCBI accession number CR749337) from colon cancer tissue was identified. this transcript uses an alternative splice donor site in exon 2. this truncation deletes a small portion of the N-terminal domain, the entire A1 and B1 domains, and a large portion of the A2 domain. expression of full-length and CEA splice variant transcripts in normal and cancerous tissues is unknown. real-time qPCR was performed using RNA isolated from frozen primary human pancreatic tissues and cDNA generated from frozen colorectal, lung, breast and pancreatic tissues. qPCR was performed using both RNA isolated from frozen primary human pancreatic tissues and cDNA generated from frozen cDNA arrays. full-length CEA transcripts were commonly detected (Ct30) in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (4 of 5), colon (41 of 42), gastroesophageal (38 of 42), lung (39 of 40) and breast cancers (38 of 41) of various grades and stages. no expression (Ct>30) or low level (25Ct30) expression of full-length CEA transcripts was found in normal breast tissue (3 of 4) adenocarcinoma 41/42 (98%) 41/42 (98%) Pancreas, normal 3/4 (75%) 0/4 (0%) Pancreas, adenocarcinoma 4/5 (80%) 1/5 (20%) Pancreas, Endocrine Tumor 2/14 (14%) 0/14 (0%) Gastroesophageal, normal 6/6 (100%) 5/6 (83%) Gastroesophageal, cancer 38/42 (90%) expression of the CEA splice variant transcript was infrequently found in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (1 of 5) and was not found in endocrine pancreatic cancers (0 of 14) normal colon (5 of 5) and gastroesophageal (5 of 6) tissues showed CEA splice variant expression, but was absent in normal pancreas (0 of 4), lung (0 of 8), and breast (0 of 7). expression of the CEA splice variant transcripts a higher level of MEDI-565 binding was observed for cells expressing both the CEA splice variant and full length CEA together relative to cells expressing only full length CEA. a higher level of MEDI-565 binding was observed for cells expressing both the CEA splice variant and full length CEA. p = 0.60 comparing CD8+ T cell activation EC50 values between CHO FL CEA and CHO FL+SV CEA. p = 0.15 comparing CD4+ T cell activation EC50 values between CHO FL CEA and CHO FL+SV CEA. MEDI-565 mediated the killing of human tumor cells that expressed CEA, but not those that did not express cell surface CEA. a control BiTE did not induce T cell lysis of CEA positive or negative cells. MEDI-565 Binds a nonlinear Epitope in the A2 Domain of CEA. the full-length CEA transcript contains 10 exons and 9 introns. the mutants were transiently expressed as GPI-anchored proteins on HEK293 F cells. 65 still recognized the corresponding truncated CEA protein at a level similar to that measured for full-length CEA protein. the epitope of MEDI-565 is localized in the A2 domain of CEA. two truncated mutants (A2 and A3) were engineered and used as templates for the construction of swap mutants. segment C significantly contributed to MEDI-565 binding, but to a lesser degree than segment A. swap mutant-based approach could not be ruled out using a swap mutant-based approach. the binding of MEDI-565 was substantially decreased to the variants in which residue N333 was mutated. replacing only residue N333 with either its counterpart residue Lys in the A3 domain (KO_N) or with Ala abolished MEDI-565 binding. modeled structure of the A2 domain of CEA revealed two clusters of amino acids (V388G389P390E392 and I408N410) in segment C (green) that were spatially close to the critical aa N333 (red) in segment A (yellow), while segment B (cyan) was distal to aa N333. binding characteristics of MEDI-565 to CEA mutants with single or combinatorial mutations disrupted the binding of knock-out amino acids V388G389P390E392 and I408N410 (KI_C) had no effect in abolishing or restoring MEDI-565 binding. knock-out variants exhibited an incorrect fold in or near the MEDI-565 epitope region, thereby losing their binding capacity. the epitope of CEA bound by MEDI-565 is a nonlinear, conformational epitope located in the A2 domain of CEA. it is comprised of two segments of amino acids 326 to 349 and 388 to 410 with critical amino acids F326, T328, N333, V388, G389, P390, E392, I408, and N410. the residue N333 may contribute more to the binding of MEDI-565, since minor allele frequencies in the population for rs10407503 are 0.0140.267 and minor allele frequencies for rs7249230 are 0.030.3 in the population. however, the minor allele homozygosity rate for rs7249230 is close to 0 in both European and Asian populations. the identified CEA SNPs will have little or no impact on MEDI-565 binding to CEA. sequences within the middle part of a 152 bp PCR product did not match any part of the genomic sequence of CEA. this PCR product more likely represents a PCR artifact and not a real CEA splice form. the biological function and distribution of the CEA splice variant in normal and cancerous tissues is unknown. expression of the CEA splice variant transcript in a single positive adenocarcinoma specimen was concordant with full-length CEA transcript expression. full-length CEA transcripts were commonly detected in pancreatic adenocarcinomas (4 of 5), colon (41 of 42), gastroesophageal (38 of 42), lung (39 of 40) and breast cancers (38 of 41) of various grades and stages. Tissue Type Full Length CEA expression CEA splice variant expression Pancreas, Normal 3/4 (75%) 0/4 (0%) Pancreas, Benign Adenoma 1/2 (50%) 0/2 (0%) Pancreas, Adenocarcinoma 12/13 (92%) 1/13 (8%) Pancreas, Endocrine Tumor 3/5 (60%) 0/5 (0%) Colon, normal 5/5 (100%) 5/5 (100%) Pancrea expression of the CEA splice variant transcripts in the tissue cDNA arrays was found in most colon (41 of 42) and in half of the tested gastroesophageal cancers (21 of 42) expression was also seen in a proportion of lung (12 of 40) and breast cancers (5 of 41) of various grades and stages. expression of the CEA splice variant transcripts was always coexpressed with full-length CEA transcripts. the amino acids in full-length CEA important for MEDI-565 binding were found to be absent in the CEA splice variant. this observation suggested that binding of MEDI-565 to the CEA splice variant was unlikely to occur. a higher level of MEDI-565 binding was observed for cells expressing both the CEA splice variant and full length CEA together relative to cells expressing only full length CEA. CHO cells were tested for their susceptibility to be killed by CD3+ T cells from 3 individual donors in the presence of MEDI-565 at the indicated concentrations. p = 0.79 comparing cytotoxicity EC50 values between CHO FL CEA and CHO FL+SV CEA cells. -length CEA on the same cells did not significantly affect the apparent binding affinity of MEDI-565 to full-length CEA. homophilic interactions between full-length CEA proteins also do not appear to prevent the binding of MEDI-565 [17], [18] or other CEA-specific BiTE antibodies [16]. CHO SV CEA did not trigger the activation of T cells from healthy donors in presence of MEDI-565. MEDI-565 mediated the killing of human tumor cells that expressed CEA, but not those that did not express cell surface CEA. the most extensive investigations involve the classification of 52 anti-CEA mAbs into five distinct epitopes, Gold epitopes 1\u20135, by competitive binding analysis [50], [53], [54]. the epitope of the CEA-specific arm of MEDI-565 belongs to the Gold epitope 2, which has been localized in the A2-B2 domains [53] and identified as a CEA-specific epitope group [56] some anti-CEA mAbs bind repetitive epitopes of CEA [51] and some are highly cross-reactive, lacking specificity to CEA [56]. a single splice variant was identified lacking a portion of the A2 domain critical for MEDI-565 binding to CEA. however, since MEDI-565 did not bind the CEA splice variant due to loss of the antibody-binding epitope, it was clear that the splice variant itself is not a target for MEDI-565. the full-length CEA protein is indicated by a arrowhead and the CEA splice variant by an open arrowhead. a band at 100 kDa is presumed to be a non-glycosylated form of CEA. table S1 Ct values for full-length (FL) CEA and CEA splice variant (SV) cDNA expression in A, pancreas; B, colon; C, breast; D, lung; E, gastrointestinal tissues."}
