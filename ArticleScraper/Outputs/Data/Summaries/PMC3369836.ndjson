{"summary": "diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic diseases that has been classified as a disease of glucose overproduction by tissues without enough insulin production. the risk of developing type-2 diabetes increases with age, obesity, cardiovascular disease (hypertension, dyslipidaemia), lack of physical activity, and family history of diabetes. antidiabetic drugs could improve insulin sensitivity and thus lower glucose or fatty acid levels in type-2 diabetic patients [9], some side effects would be caused, such as weight gain, fluid accumulation, and pulmonary edema [11]. a critical challenge for developing dual agonists is how to identify the receptor subtype selectivity ratio [13]. GW409544 was obtained by modifying the structure of farglitazar, a dual agonist for both PPAR and PPAR [37]. the latter contains a vinylogous amide as the L-tyrosine N-substituent [37]. the binding-site encompassed the ligand GW409544, which was observed in the crystal structures of both PPAR (1k71) and PPAR (1k74) as a ligand. the information of the binding pocket of a receptor for its ligand is very important for drug design, particularly for conducting mutagenesis studies. conformation obtained by docking GW409544 and Comp#1 respectively to (A) PPAR (1k7l) and (B) PPAR (1k74. the binding pocket is defined by residues that have at least one heavy atom with a distance of 5 from the ligand. the drug-like database and the fragment database derived from ZINC [50] were used for virtual screening and core hopping searching. a new docking algorithm called \u201cCore Hopping\u201d [36] was adopted in this study that is featured by having the functions to perform the fragment-based replacing and molecular docking. the 2nd step is to define the \u201creceptor grid file\u201d, which was done in the \u201cProtocore Preparation\u201d panel. the 4th step is to align and dock the entire molecular structure built up by the core and scaffold. the cores are sorted and filtered by goodness of alignment and then redocked into the receptor after attaching the scaffold. [39] was adopted to study the internal motions of the receptor-ligand system. the OPLS 2005 force fields [64], [65] was used to build aqueous biological systems. the TIP3P model [66] was used to simulate water molecules. als surface area of polar nitrogen and oxygen atoms (PSA) and apparent MDCK permeability were considered in the QikPro to evaluate the acceptability of the compounds. the two proteins contain the same ligand GW409544 as PPAR and PPAR do, and their binding affinities with the ligand are quite similar. the binding pocket of a protein receptor to a ligand is defined by those residues that have at least one heavy atom with a distance of 5 from a heavy atom of the ligand. a similar approach has also been used to define the binding pockets of many other receptor-ligand interactions important for drug design [15], [17], [47], [48]. the PPAR binding site is composed of three arms, namely arm I, arm II, and arm III. the first arm has mainly polar character including the AF2 (transcriptional activation function 2) helix indicated by red ribbon. the binding conformation thus obtained will be taken as an initial structure for further optimization by searching the fragment database to find the optimal cores. a total of 500 chemical compounds were prepared with the LigPre module [53], which consists of the procedures of generating possible states by ionization at. the OPLS 2005 force fields [64], [65] was used to build aqueous biological systems, and the TIP3P model [66] was used to simulate water molecules. in order to get an electrically neutral system, the minimum number of sodium and chloride ions needed to balance the system charge was placed randomly in the solvated system. a total of 44 properties of compounds can be predicted, including the principal descriptors and physiochemical properties. with the QikProp software, a total of 44 properties of compounds can be predicted, including the principal descriptors. the 2nd core hopping operation was aimed at the Core C part (see red part of Fig. 2 ). each of the 25 derivative compounds was docked into the receptors PPAR and PPAR. each of the 25 compounds ranked roughly according to their docking scores. 2 Comp#24 A-B5-C4 15.87 16.18 168.65 4.84 6.50 98.65 3 Comp#3 A-B1-C3 14.89 16.08 160.40 4.75 6.59 108.32 4 Comp#14 A-B3-C4 15.10 15.98 190.08 3.55 6.28 101.99 5 Comp#2 A-B1-C2 14.97 15.92 195.19 4.10 6.81 101.99 5 Comp#13 A-B3-C 101.16 15 Comp#23 A-B5-C3 15.58 15.06 176.72 4.89 7.70 104.35 16 Comp#5 A-B1-C5 14.77 15.00 197.47 4.05 7.30 101.13 17 Comp#21 A-B5-C1 14.78 14.98 152.24 6.45 9.10 106.45 18 Comp#18 A-B4-C3 13.72 14.91 186.33 4.43 7.08 104.19 19 Comp# e The apparent MDCK permeability (nm/s); MDCK cells are considered to be a good mimic for the bloodbrain barrier. QikProp predictions are for non-active transport (25 poor; >500 great) Molecular Dynamics Trajectory Analysis Molecular dynamics can provide useful information for characterizing the internal motions of biomacromolecules with time. for a comparison study, the 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed, respectively, for the crystal structures of PPAR (1k7l), PPAR (1k74), as well as their complexes with GW409544 and Comp#1, i.e., PPAR-GW409544. the RMSD curves for PPAR, PPAR, PPAR-GW409544, PPAR-GW409544, PPAR-Comp#1 and PPAR-Comp#1 were also computed, respectively. it is instructive to point out that the RMSF curve of PPAR-Comp#1 or PPAR-GW409544 is highly similar to that of PPAR-GW409544 or PPAR-GW409544 PPAR-Comp#8 is ranked number 25 according to the strength of binding affinity with PPAR and PPAR. the RMSD and RMSF are much larger than those of PPAR-Comp#1 and PPAR-Comp#1. these phenomena indicate that Comp#8 is not as good as Comp#1 in stably binding to PPAR. derivatives as well as the original GW409544 compound were predicted by means of the QP program embedded in the \u201cSchrodinger2009 Software Package\u201d the results thus obtained are also listed in the table 1 respectively. PPAR and PPAR have a more spacious pocket (1400 3) than any other nuclear hormone receptors. new technique of \u201ccore hopping\u201d adopted in this study allows for rapid screening of novel cores to help overcome unwanted properties. a set of 10 novel compounds were found in this regard. it is anticipated that the new agonists may become potential drug candidates. each of the 25 derivative compounds was docked into the receptors PPAR and PPAR. ranked roughly according to their docking scores to the receptors PPAR and PPAR. -C4 15.10 15.98 190.08 3.55 6.28 101.99 5 Comp#2 A-B1-C2 14.97 15.92 195.19 4.10 6.81 101.99 6 Comp#13 A-B3-C3 14.68 15.86 164.26 4.34 6.16 110.42 7 Comp#16 A-B4-C1 14.26 15.71 166.47 5.03 6.92 106.95 8 Comp#17 A-B4-C2 14.44 15.32 193. -B5-C1 14.78 14.98 152.24 6.45 9.10 106.45 18 Comp#18 A-B4-C3 13.72 14.91 186.33 4.43 7.08 104.19 19 Comp#20 A-B4-C5 14.42 14.75 197.70 4.26 7.20 101.65 20 Comp#9 A-B2-C4 14.03 14.35 166.94 5.15 6.52 114.53 21 Comp#22 A-B5-C2 ikProp predictions are for non-active transport (25 poor; >500 great) shown in Fig. 1 is docked conformation of Comp#1 when aligned with GW409544 extracted from (A) the crystal complex in PPAR (1k7l) and (B) the crystal complex in PPAR (1k74), respectively. the 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed for the crystal structures of PPAR (1k7l), PPAR (1k74), as well as their complexes with GW409544 and Comp#1. all the characters concerned reached the simulation equilibrium within the 5ns (see panels A and C) the RMSD curves for PPAR-Comp#1 and PPAR-Comp#1 are more stable than those of PPAR-GW409544 and PPAR-GW409544. the detailed fluctuations of the six different structures, as well as the root mean square fluctuations, were also computed within 10 ns molecular dynamics simulations. AR-Comp#8, including the RMSD and RMSF, are much larger than those of PPAR-Comp#1 and PPAR-Comp#1, especially for the binding site of AF2 helix region. these phenomena indicate that Comp#8 is not as good as Comp#1 in stably binding to PPAR and PPAR. PPAR and PPAR have a more spacious pocket (1400 3) than any other nuclear hormone receptors [37], [72]. the agonist derivatives designed by combining their three cores would have relatively large molecular weight (MW>500) and bulky volume, a trend quite similar to case in designing the inhibitors against the protein tyrosine phosphates (PTPase) [78] new technique of \"core hopping\" allows for rapid screening of novel cores. new agonists may become potential drug candidates, or stimulate new strategy."}
