{"summary": "avian viruses pose both biosecurity and zoonotic risks in collections of caged birds and commercial domestic poultry. some avian viruses can also cause disease in humans [8\u201314] studying viruses in wild birds can be challenging as gaining access to them for the purpose of sample collection can be difficult. large number of avian patients passing through the AWHC provide an opportunity to study the viruses present in Australian birds. captive breeding and insurance programs for threatened species include a captive breeding program for the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot. the wild-bred population declining to only three females and 13 male birds in the 2016/2017 breeding season [19] avian avulavirus 3 has been documented causing mortality rates of up to 70% in captive collections of avian species. APMV-3 strains have been isolated from a diversity of avian species in different parts of the world, but has not yet been reported in Australia. avian influenza viruses can threaten human health. transmission of AIVs from wild birds to commercial poultry has occurred recently in Australia in Victoria, new south Wales and Queensland. avian coronaviruses (AvCoVs) are also of particular interest in wild birds because of the presence of variant forms of the poultry pathogen infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) in commercial poultry. samples were collected from 409 birds presented to the AWHC at Healesville Sanctuary. 299 were wild avian patients presented to the AWHC for veterinary care. 110 were captive (part of the Healesville Sanctuary collection) sterile dry swabs were used to separately swab the trachea and intestine/caecum, cut into 500 L of RNAlater\u00ae and stored at -20\u00b0C. a piece of liver was aseptically collected and stored at either -20\u00b0C or -80\u00b0C. samples of liver tissue collected at post-mortem were pulverised with a swab and the swab placed into 500 L RNAlater\u00ae. if pooled clinical samples tested positive by PCR, nucleic acid was extracted from 140 L aliquots of the corresponding original choanal/tracheal and cloacal/intestinal swab samples. alphaherpesvirus 1 or Equid alphaherpesvirus 4 DNA were used as template for positive control reactions. sterile H2O was used as the template for negative control reactions. cDNA synthesised from RNA extracted from Newcastle disease virus vaccine strain (NDV.V4) was used as the template for positive control reactions. PCR mixtures contained 0.5 M of each forward and reverse primer (GeneWorks), 2.5 L of cDNA template, 200 M (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphate, green GoTaq\u00ae Flexi buffer, 3 mM MgCl2 and 1 U GoTaq\u00ae Flexi DNA Polymerase. PCR mixtures were incubated at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes prior to 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 41\u00b0C for cDNA synthesised from RNA extracted from infectious bronchitis virus was used as the template for positive controls reactions. RNA extracted from Influenza A/Memphis/1/1971 was used as template for positive control reactions. sterile water was used for the negative control reactions. nucleotide sequences were compared with publicly available sequences in the GenBank\u00ae database. PhyML 2.2.0 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for the herpesviruses were generated from ClustalW2 [59] nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments using the general-time-reversible nucleotide substitution and Jones-Taylor-Thornton amino acid substitution models. 409 birds, 299 were wild avian patients presented to the AWHC for veterinary care, while 110 were captive. a clinical examination was performed after admission, with any observed clinical signs and diagnostic findings being recorded. samples were collected from live avian patients or at necropsy (from birds that had been euthanased or died for reasons unrelated to this study) samples of liver, spleen, kidney, lung, lung, gonad, pancreas, proventriculus, gizzard, small intestine, large intestine were also collected and fixed by submersion in 10% phosphate-buffered formalin at necropsy. formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin. nucleic acid was extracted from 140 L aliquots of the corresponding original choanal/tracheal and cloacal/intestinal swab samples. negative extraction control samples utilised 200 L aliquots of RNAlater\u00ae. cDNA synthesis SuperScriptTM III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) was used to synthesise cDNA from aliquots of extracted nucleic acid. the reverse transcriptase reaction was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions using 100 ng random primer oligonucleotides (Invitrogen) and 10 L of nucleic acid extract as template. PCR mixtures contained 0.5 M of each forward and reverse primer (GeneWorks), 2.5 L of cDNA template, 200 M (each) deoxynucleoside triphosphate, green GoTaq\u00ae Flexi buffer, 3 mM MgCl2 and 1 U GoTaq\u00ae Flexi DNA polymerase. PCR mixtures were incubated at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes prior to 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 41\u00b0C for chitis virus (strain VIC-S) was used as the template for positive controls reactions. RNA extracted from Influenza A/Memphis/1/1971 was used as template. sterile water was used for the negative control reactions. cDNA synthesised from RNA extracted from Newcastle disease virus vaccine strain (NDV.V4) was used as the template for positive control reactions. both sets of degenerate primers target the same conserved region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene. 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes prior to 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 41\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds followed by a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 minutes. a real-time RT-PCR assay using primers targeting conserved sequences within the 5\u2019-untranslated region (UTR) gene. geneious\u00ae 9.1.8 bioinformatics software (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) [58] was used to trim and align all obtained sequences. nucleotide sequences were compared with publicly available sequences in the GenBank\u00ae database. PhyML 2.2.0 maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees for the herpesviruses were generated from ClustalW2 nucleotide and amino acid sequence alignments. no influenza A viruses or avian coronaviruses were detected from any of these 408 birds. a single avian paramyxovirus was detected from a choanal swab from a wild musk lorikeet (Glossopsitta concinna) avian herpesvirus detected from a tawny frogmouth (Podargidae; Podargus strigoides), tentatively designated Podargid alphaherpesvirus 1 0/35 0/35 Gruiformes 0/7 0/7 Charadriiformes 0/4 0/4 0/4 Procellariiformes 0/1 0/1 0/1 Pelecaniformes 0/13 avian herpesvirus DNA was detected from three birds. a sulphur-crested cockatoo, a tawny frogmouth and a powerful owl were all wildlife. no avian herpesviruses were detected from the captive birds tested. avian herpesviruses from a tawny frogmouth and a cockatoo were detected. the closest matches to the 485 bp nucleotide sequence from the tawny frogmouth swab were avian herpesviruses within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. it is unknown whether the tawny frogmouth is the natural host of this newly the tawny frogmouth showed no expression of clinical disease during its period of rehabilitation. the virus was not detected in DNA extracted from pooled choanal/tracheal and cloacal/intestinal swab samples. the closest match to the 489 bp nucleotide sequence from the sulphur-crested cockatoo swab was the DNA polymerase gene of PsHV1. the nucleotide sequence of the DNA polymerase gene fragment from this novel herpesvirus has been deposited in GenBank (accession number MF576271) Fig 1. PhyML maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree of avian alphaherpesviruses. generated from a ClustalW2 alignment of partial DNA polymerase gene sequences. alphaherpesvirus 1 AY571851; alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 AF005370; alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 EF643560; bovine alphaherpesvirus 1 X94677; bovine alphaherpesvirus 2 AF031808; cacatuid alphaherpesvirus 1 MF576271; Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 AF female sulphur-crested cockatoo was found unable to fly in Lilydale, Victoria (37\u00b075'73\"S, 145\u00b037'20\"E) on 17th September 2015, presenting emaciated and weak with haemorrhagic enteritis. ovarian tissue collected at necropsy revealed chronic enteritis with unidentified piriform protozoa in intestinal crypts and foci of mucosal and crypt necrosis. it is presumed that the protozoan and Macrorhabdus overgrowth were secondary to immunosuppression caused by BFDV infection. no inclusion bodies, inflammation in the lungs nor any other sign of herpesvirus infection were seen in any of the tissues examined histologically gene obtained from this musk lorikeet did not match any currently known paramyxovirus, but had highest nucleotide sequence identity with strains of Avian avulavirus 5. paramyxovirus RNA was not detected from any of the other three wild musk lorikeets tested in this study. PCR detection of viruses Pooled choanal/tracheal and cloacal/intestinal swab samples from the study population detailed in S1 Table were screened for the presence of viruses from three families of RNA viruses. no influenza A viruses or avian coronaviruses were detected from any of these 408 birds. 0/24 0/24 0/24 Columbiformes 0/35 0/35 0/35 Caprimulgiformes 1/35 \u2013 a novel avian herpesvirus detected from a tawny frogmouth (Podargidae;

alcelaphine gammaherpesvirus 1 AF005370. sulphur-crested cockatoo was found unable to fly in Lilydale, Victoria. emaciated and weak with haemorrhagic enteritis and clinical signs suggestive of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) infection. no inclusion bodies, inflammation in the lungs nor any other sign of herpesvirus infection were seen in any of the tissues examined histologically. no inclusion bodies, inflammation in the lungs nor any other sign of herpesvirus infection were seen in any of the tissues examined histologically. avian paramyxovirus from a wild musk lorikeet was found unable to fly in Bundoora Park. the bird was released back where it was found on BLAST analysis. the 603 bp sequence fragment of the paramyxovirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene obtained from this musk lorikeet did not match any currently known paramyxovirus. avian herpesvirus from a powerful owl was found moribund on 1st May 2015 in St Kilda, Victoria (37\u00b087'17\"S, 144\u00b097'95\"E) only DNA extracted from the same individual owl gave a strong positive band. a female powerful owl was found moribund on 1st May 2015. two novel avian herpesviruses from a tawny frogmouth and a cockatoo were detected. the closest matches to the 485 bp nucleotide sequence were avian herpesviruses within the subfamily Alphaherpesvirinae. it is unknown whether the tawny frogmouth is the natural host of this newly identified alphaherpesvirus. the virus was not detected in DNA extracted from pooled choanal/tracheal and cloacal/intestinal swab samples. the tawny frogmouth showed no expression of clinical disease during its period of rehabilitation. the closest match to the 489 bp nucleotide sequence from the cockatoo swab was the DNA polymerase gene of PsHV1 (GenBank accession number AY372243) gene gene sequences of Podargid alphaherpesvirus 1 and Cacatuid alphaherpesvirus 1 are found in geneBank. avian alphaherpesvirus nucleotide sequences are available in geneBank. generated from a ClustalW2 alignment of amino acid translations of partial DNA polymerase gene sequences. bovine gammaherpesvirus 6 AF031808; bovine gammaherpesvirus 6 AF031808; cacatuid alphaherpesvirus 1 MF576271; Columbid alphaherpesvirus 1 AF141890; elephantid betaherpesvirus 1 AF322977; Equid alphaherpesvirus 2 AF434378; Felid alphaherpesvirus 1 KR296657; female sulphur-crested cockatoo found unable to fly in Victoria. emaciated and weak with haemorrhagic enteritis and clinical signs suggestive of beak and feather disease virus (BFDV) infection. oan and macrorhabdus overgrowth were secondary to immunosuppression caused by BFDV infection. no inclusion bodies, inflammation in the lungs nor any other sign of herpesvirus infection were seen in any of the tissues examined histologically. avian paramyxovirus from a wild musk lorikeet was found unable to fly in Bundoora Park in December 2014. phylogenetic analysis suggests this avulavirus strain belongs to the serotype Avian avulavirus 5. paramyxovirus RNA was not detected from any of the other three wild musk lorikeets tested in this study. study of avian coronaviruses in wild birds in other countries, using the same primers [54] as the present study, has detected AvCoVs at a higher prevalence than was determined in this present study. a bias towards sick or injured birds, particular locations and common urban species should be considered when these results are interpreted. a pan-Coronaviridae PCR assay would be useful for elucidating the origin of variant IBV in Australian poultry. future studies focused on species of wild birds known to be in closest contact with commercial poultry. the paramyxovirus detected in a musk lorikeet had highest nucleotide sequence identity to Avian avulavirus 5. the clinical significance of the avulavirus strain detected in the present study is undetermined. the bird showed no clinical disease during rehabilitation. it is possible that the APMV strain represents an avirulent genotype of APMV-5 circulating amongst wild psittacines in Australia. many species of Australian parrots are susceptible to APMV-3 and/or PsHV1 infection and disease [26\u201328, 83], so the potential establishment of both viruses in Australia poses significant risks to Australian Psittaciformes and their conservation. both APMV-3 and PsHV1 have been reported in numerous Australian psittacine species held in captivity overseas. three avian herpesviruses were detected in the present study. the virus causes herpesviral inclusion body disease or inclusion body hepatitis in birds of prey. a recent study has suggested that coHV1 is enzootic in feral pigeon flocks in Australia. the 485 bp sequence obtained from the tawny frogmouth and the 489 bp sequence obtained from the sulphur-crested cockatoo showed 76% and 66.5% nucleotide identities to the most genetically similar known herpesviruses. this level of identity in this highly conserved region of the herpesvirus DNA polymerase gene is sufficient to indicate that the viruses are new species. no avian herpesviruses nor paramyxoviruses were detected from the captive birds tested in this study. there was no significant difference in the prevalence of detection of avian viruses between the wild and captive bird study populations."}
