{"summary": "for the years surrounding the 1918 pandemic, we obtained monthly mortality rate data from various official sources in Singapore. for the years surrounding the 1957 and 1968 pandemics, data were obtained from the Registry of Births and Deaths, Singapore. for the years surrounding the 1918 pandemic, data were obtained from the annual departmental reports of the Straits Settlements. the 1918 Straits Settlements Annual Report described an influenza epidemic in June and July that was relatively mild, with a high illness rate but a low mortality rate, that peaked during the week ending July 6 (9). a second intense wave occurred in October and November, leading to frequent pneumonia and a high mortality rate. the Straits Settlements\u2019 overall annual mortality rate was \u201c43.85 per thousand in 1918 when the influenza epidemic struck the country\u201d (10). no deaths (in 1,000s) Mortality rate (per 1,000), % References United States 402\u2013675 3.9\u20136.5 (8,11\u201313) Canada 50.0\u201351.0 6.1\u20136.3 (8,12) Denmark 6.02\u201312.4 2.0\u20134.1 (8,12) England 116\u2013200 3.4\u20135.8 (8,12) Spain 257\u2013311 12.3\u201314.9 (8,12) Portugal 59.0\u2013159 9.8\u201326.4 (8,12) India 185 6.1\u2013 the 1957 pandemic in Singapore was first recognized at the end of April and early May. it was purported to have spread through Hong Kong from its origins in northern Asia. by May 5, the outbreak had become an epidemic, reaching its peak in mid-May and tapering off by the end of the month (20). the outbreak in Singapore peaked August 16\u201325. attendance at outpatient dispensaries increased over a 2-week period. excess mortality rate was 0.27/1,000 (543/2,012,000) during august and September 1968. the excess mortality rate of the epidemic in Singapore alone was 7.76 per 1,000 (2,870/369,800) during May\u2013June and October\u2013November 1918. the excess mortality rate for Singapore during the 1918 pandemic years of 1918\u201320 to be 1.80% (18/1,000, or 6,656 deaths) 8.0\u201328.4 (8,12) Argentina 10.2\u201346.0 1.2\u20135.4 (8,12) Australia 14.5\u201315.4 2.7\u20132.9 (8,12) Kenya 104\u2013150 40\u201357.8 (8) South Africa 300 44.3 (8) British Honduras (Belize) 1.01\u20132.00 2.3\u20134.6 (15) Trinidad and tobago 0.30\u20131.00 0.1\u20130.2 (15) Singapore 2.87\u20136.66 7.8\u201318.0 This report aims to reduce the effect an excess mortality rate of 0.47/1,000 occurred in May 1957. this represented 680 deaths in a population of 1,445,900. there was another small peak of excess deaths in October 1958. the 1968 epidemic caused substantial illness and absenteeism from work. the ministry of education and health considered the closure of schools. but decided against it because of the waning of the epidemic. excess mortality rate for Singapore was higher than the global average rate. this is also evident when one compares the mortality rates for tropical countries such as ceylon and Singapore with rates for tropical Caribbean islands. by the end of the second wave of the pandemic in Singapore, there were still reports of influenza in Malaysia, Indonesia, New Zealand, and Japan (9,29) if a pandemic were to first appear in less industrialized regions with high baseline mortality rates, the pandemic might be missed or dismissed as another spike of endemic infectious diseases. in 1957, the closure of 670 schools affected 262,000 students who required alternative care and education. commercial firms reported staff absenteeism of 10%\u201330% (31) 1918 pandemic is thought to have originated early in the year and had spread to Singapore by June. another globally connected city, new york, also showed an early wave in February\u2013April 1918. mortality rates suggest that the 1918 epidemic in Singapore may have occurred in May, which is earlier than in official reports. the 20th-century pandemics swept through Singapore within 4 weeks. future plans must include such a possibility over a similarly short duration."}
