{"summary": "liver biopsy remains the gold standard for staging HCV-associated liver disease. this test can result in serious complications and is subject to sampling errors. sera from 83 HIV/HCV co- and 68 HCV mono-infected subjects in 4 stages of fibrosis were tested. HIV/hepatitis C virus (HCV) co-infection affects more than 30% of HIV-infected patients in developed countries. the effects of HIV on HCV infection include higher rate of viral persistence and increased HCV viral loads (VL) analysis of combinations of several biomarkers offers enhanced diagnostic accuracy compared to individual biomarkers that have limited diagnostic sensitivities and specificities. the platform has been successfully used as a discovery tool for biomarkers associated with inflammation [15], cancers [16\u201318] and human infectious diseases [19\u201322]. 151 individuals were studied, including 68 HCV mono-infected and 83 HIV/HCV co-infected subjects. patients at each of the 4 stages of fibrosis stage: F0-1 (F1), F2, F3, F4/ESLD (F4) were selected for this analysis. samples were fractionated prior to the SELDI-TOF MS analysis. fractions 1 (pH 9 and flow through), 3 (pH 5) and 6 (organic) were selected for analysis on CM10 arrays. optimization experiments with IMAC30 and H50 arrays led to similar results. each spot was read at low- and high-energy laser intensities. d fibrosis, d fibrosis, positive population with F3-F4 (significant fibrosis) peaks with p values 0.05 and receiver operating characteristic values > 0.75 or 0.25 were considered potential biomarkers. tryptic digests were extracted with 50:25:15:10 formic acid/acetonitrile/isopropanol/water (2 times) and 100% acetonitrile (2 times) and vacuum dried. eluted in 4 L of -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix (10 mg/mL in 50:50 acetonitrile/0.1% TFA in water) MS/MS acquisition of selected precursors was set to 2000 shots per spectrum with 50 shots per sub-spectrum using a fixed laser intensity of 4200 nJ. Peptides present in positive samples but absent in negative samples were selected. patients at each of the 4 stages of fibrosis stage: F0-1 (F1), F2, F3, F4/ESLD (F4) were selected for this analysis. samples were fractionated on re-hydrated Q HyperD F beads by pH into 6 fractions using bio-Rad serum fractionation kit. fractions 1 (pH 9 and flow through), 3 (pH 5) and 6 (organic) were selected for analysis on CM10 arrays. each spot was read at low- and high-energy laser intensities. each spot was read at low- and high-energy laser intensities. similar analysis was performed to find discriminator peaks between the four stages of fibrosis (F0-1, F2, F3 and F4) similar analysis was performed to find discriminator peaks between the four stages of fibrosis (F0-1, F2, F3 and F4) peptide samples were eluted in 4 L of -cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) matrix (10 mg/mL in 50:50 acetonitrile/0.1% TFA in water) the solution was directly spotted onto a 384-well AB OptiTOF stainless steel plate (AB Sciex, Framingham, MA) and allowed to dry at room temperature. MS/MS acquisition of selected precursors was set to 2000 shots per spectrum with 50 shots per sub-spectrum using a fixed laser intensity of 4200 nJ. protein identification was performed with ProteinPilot 4.0.8 software using the Paragon algorithm (AB Sciex) Peptides present in positive samples but absent in negative samples were selected. the characteristics according to fibrosis score are also shown in Table 1.

Fig 3. Serum levels of the 22.8, 24.2, 33.3 and 133.4 k[m/z] biomarkers for HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected individuals combined according to fibrosis stage. each point represents a separate individual. immunoglobulin (Ig) kappa chain constant (C) region (13.8 k(m/z)), haptoglobin (46.8 k(m/z) and its alpha chain (18.4 k(m/z)) was a possible truncated form of apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA1 (22.8 k(m/z)), plasminogen (84.6 k(m/z) and serotransfer a biomarker pattern based on CART analysis was used to generate candidate diagnostic algorithms. the numbers in the root node, descendant nodes and the terminal nodes represent mass values (Cxxxxxx) followed by intensity values. the aspirate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI) has been validated as a surrogate marker of significant hepatic fibrosis in HIV/HCV co-infection. five out of eight co-infected patients \"misclassified\" by our SELDI-TOF MS biomarkers had APRI values that did not correlate with their biopsy score. this could be because the biological differences between the infections. biomarkers can be used to stage liver fibrosis in mono- and co-infected individuals. it is very likely that several of our candidate biomarkers are \u2018general\u2019 markers for liver damage. this leads us to believe there is a potential to identify biomarkers that could diagnose fibrosis independent of HIV infection status. the fibrotest is based on haptoglobin, alpha-2 macroglobulin, gamma globulin, ApoA1, gamma glutamyl transferase and total bilirubin measurement. using SELDI-TOF MS technology we could stage discrete levels of liver fibrosis as changes of intensity of these biomarkers are detected. authors found complement C4-a and inter-alpha-trypsin inhibition to heavy chain H4 as biomarker candidates for predicting hepatic fibrosis. they also found ApoA1, Ig kappa chain C region, haptoglobin and others as potential biomarker candidates. this study only included pooled serum samples of 24 people with chronic HCV and 6 non-infected individuals. non-invasive measures of liver fibrosis are gaining acceptance for long-term evaluation of hepatic complication in HIV/HCV co-infected and HCV mono-infected patients. the identification of the biomarkers may also give unique insight into the complex and prolonged host-virus interactions that lead to liver fibrosis."}
