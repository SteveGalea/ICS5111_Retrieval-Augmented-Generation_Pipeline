{"summary": "patients admitted with clinical features suggestive of SARS were investigated for SARS-CoV infection by a combination of methods including direct detection of viral RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) patients admitted with clinical features suggestive of SARS were investigated for SARS-CoV infection by a combination of methods including direct detection of viral RNA by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction. this control group consisted of 540 patients; 126 were pediatric patients 6 months to 15 years of age; 40.0% were girls. overall, 16.3% of this control group were confirmed to have infections with respiratory viruses or atypical pathogens. serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. a fluorescein isothiocyanate\u2013conjugated rabbit anti-human antibody was added at a dilution of 1 to 40, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. results were crosschecked by two experienced technicians. each test run contained 50 testing samples mixed with 5 known positive controls. a patient was defined as a true SARS case when he or she had the following two conditions: 1) fulfilled the WHO criteria of a probable case of SARS (11), and 2) had one or more specimens positive for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR or isolation. 16.3% of this control group were confirmed to have infections with respiratory viruses or atypical pathogens. a healthy group was included as non-SARS controls. antibody was added at a dilution of 1 to 40, and incubated for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. results were crosschecked by two experienced technicians. each test run contained 50 testing samples mixed with 5 known positive controls and was tested in a blind fashion. 94 (91.3%) cases showed seroconversion, and 9 (8.7%) showed a fourfold rise in antibody titer. anti-SARS-CoV IgG positive rate and titer according to time of blood sample collectiona. antibody assays based on virus-infected cells or whole viral lysate may produce cross-reactivity between infections because of closely related viruses. the specificity of whole virus-based assays for the diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection is a concern."}
