CDC continues to evaluate travel restriction criteria as it relates to persons with HREs and disease-specific exposure risk classifications. the nature and volume of persons placed on PHTR in compressed timeframes during the Ebola outbreak was unprecedented. challenges in implementing and removing PHTRs were related to the large number of urgent requests for PHTRs over short periods during outbreaks. PHTRs reinforce recommended controlled movement of persons with HREs to communicable diseases."}
