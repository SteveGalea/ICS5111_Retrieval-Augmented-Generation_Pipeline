{"summary": "cohort 1 comprised hospitalized patients with acute respiratory tract infection. nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) samples were collected upon hospital admission. cohort 2 comprised outpatients with diarrhea, who had>3 loose stools in the previous 24 hours. stool, throat swab, and serum samples were also collected. none of the recruited healthy children exhibited ARTI, diarrhea, or HFMD-related symptoms during the recent one month of recruit. EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) were subjected to detection of enterovirus (EV) and further classification of EV71 and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) was performed using real-time PCR using previously described primers32. cohort 1 comprised hospitalized patients with acute respiratory tract infection. nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) samples were collected upon hospital admission. cohort 2 comprised outpatients with diarrhea, who had>3 loose stools in the previous 24 hours. all collected samples were tested for SAFV using real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay targeting the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) none of the recruited healthy children exhibited ARTI, diarrhea, or HFMD-related symptoms during the recent one month of recruit. amplicons were subjected to detection of enterovirus (EV) and coxsackievirus A16 (CVA16) was performed using real-time PCR. semi-nested RT-PCR was performed for other EV-positive samples using previously reported primers33. 6052 patients (1647, 2013, and 2392 patients in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were recruited into the study, 3810 (62.9%) of which were boys. Ages ranged from 26 days to 14 years (median, 12 months) more boys were included in cohort 1 (P = 0.044) and older age was presented in cohort 3 (P 0.001) (Table 1). 115 (1.9%) were SAFV-positive, [17 (1.0%), 12 (0.6%), and 86 (3.6%) from cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. no positive detection was found in any type of samples from asymptomatic children. co-detections with other viruses were found in 70.4% (81/115) of the SAFV-positive patients, including 77 co-detections with one virus, three with two viruses, and one with three viruses. the patients with SAFV single infection had a median age of 20 months (range, 9 months\u2013108 months), and 13 (70.6%) were boys, which were comparable with co-detection patients (all P> 0.05). in cohorts 2 and 3, the age and gender profiles were highly comparable between the SAFV-positive and SAFV-negative patients (all P> 0.05) the demographic and clinical characteristics of the SAFV infected patients were highly comparable. 0 (0) 1 (7.1) 26 (1.6) 0.246c 0.823c Cohort 2 (n = 12) (n = 3) (n = 9) (n = 2001) Age, months (median, range) 11 (2\u201338) 13 (11\u201314) 10 (2\u201337) 10 (1\u20131630) 0.774a 0.266a Sex, boy (%) 9 (75.0) 2 (66.7) 7 (77.8) 1246 (62.2) 0.552b 0.618 respiratory system syndromes were defined as the presence of at least one of the followings: cough, bronchitis or other upper respiratory tract disease, or pneumonia. digestive system syndromes were defined as the presence of at least one of the followings: diarrhea or vomit; circulatory system syndromes were defined as the presence of at least one of the followings: meningitis, encephalitis, brain myelitis, coma, acute flaccid paralysis or seizures. we also analyzed whether the co-detection of SAFV might aggravate the clinical outcome of EV infected HFMD patients. the results showed that 18 out of 23 (78.3%) SAFV/EV71 co-detected patients developed severe HFMD, significantly higher than those with EV71 single detection (78.3% vs. 42.6%, P = 0.001). cleotide sequences of Saffold cardiovirus detected in clinical samples of 82 patients in the current study. a spatial pattern of the genetic clustering was identified for each genotype. for SAFV-1, four lineages were formed, and all the Chinese strains were grouped into one lineage. phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the 285 VP1 nucleotide sequences of SAFVs. strains labeled with yellow dots were obtained from patients with diarrhea. Detection and genotyping of SAFV in three cohorts of patients. 6052 patients (1647, 2013, and 2392 patients in cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively) were recruited into the study, 3810 (62.9%) of which were boys. ages ranged from 26 days to 14 years (median, 12 months) 115 (1.9%) were SAFV-positive, [17 (1.0%), 12 (0.6%), and 86 (3.6%) from cohorts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. no positive detection was found in any type of samples from asymptomatic children. co-detections with other viruses were found in 70.4% (81/115) of the SAFV-positive patients, including 77 co-detections with one virus, three with two viruses, and one with three viruses. the patients with SAFV single infection had a median age of 20 months (range, 9 months\u2013108 months), and 13 (70.6%) were boys, which were comparable with co-detection patients. in cohorts 2 and 3, the age and gender profiles were highly comparable between the SAFV-positive and SAFV-negative patients (all P> 0.05) the demographic and clinical characteristics of the SAFV infected patients were highly comparable between the SAFV-positive and SAFV-negative patients. throat 1 (5.9) 0 (0) 1 (7.1) 26 (1.6) 0.246c 0.823c Cohort 2 (n = 12) (n = 3) (n = 9) (n = 2001) Age, months (median, range) 11 (2\u201338) 13 (11\u201314) 10 (2\u201337) 10 (1\u20131630) 0.774a 0.266a Sex, boy (%) 9 (75.0) 2 (66.7) 7 (77.8) 1246 (62.2) 0.5 respiratory system syndromes were defined as the presence of at least one of the followings: vomiting or vomiting; circulatory system syndromes were defined as the presence of at least one of the followings: diarrhea or vomit; circulatory system syndromes were defined as the presence of at least one of the followings: meningitis, encephalitis, brain myelitis, coma, acute flaccid paralysis or seizures. s of patients with SAFV single detection were insignificantly different from those with SAFV co-detection (Table 2). the results showed that 18 out of 23 (78.3%) SAFV/EV71 co-detected patients developed severe HFMD, significantly higher than those with EV71 single detection (78.3% vs. 42.6%, P = 0.001) a spatial pattern of the genetic clustering was identified for each genotype. for SAFV-1, four lineages were formed, and all the Chinese strains were grouped into one lineage. all the SAFV-1 cases from the current study were grouped into the Chongqing sublineage, regardless of the cohort group. Phylogenetic trees were constructed based on the 285 VP1 nucleotide sequences of SAFVs. strains labeled with yellow dots were obtained from patients with diarrhea. the prevalence of SAFV in pediatric patients in the recent four years in Chongqing, china was determined by performing molecular epidemiological investigation on three cohorts of patients. an unexpected significantly higher prevalence of SAFV was found in HFMD patients, especially in patients with HFMD-associated encephalitis. the co-detection of SAFV with other viruses ranged from 0% to 100% in previous studies. the current results might represent a higher probability of single infection than previous studies. this study also revealed the negative detection of SAFV in healthy children. the existence of SAFV-3 was observed in the CSF and fecal samples of a 9-year-old boy with aseptic meningitis. among half of the SAFV-positive CSFs and sera, SAFV was the solely detected pathogen. this study is the first to document SAFV in HFMD patients. the high frequency of SAFV in the stools, CSFs, and sera of children with HFMD suggests that this new virus might contribute to HFMD, especially in HFMD-associated encephalitis."}
