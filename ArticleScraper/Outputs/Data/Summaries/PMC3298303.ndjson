{"summary": "all captured bats were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection (15 mg/kg) of tiletamine and zolazepam (Virbac, Carros, France) and killed by cardiac exsanguination. the experiment was conducted in accordance with the guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. PCR amplicons were gel purified by using NucleoSpin Extract II. cloned by using a TOPO-TA pCR2.1 Cloning Kit (Invitrogen) sequences were performed in an ABI 3130 XL DNA analyzer. experimentally infected bats were examined daily for clinical signs of infection. a sample of large intestine from a lesser dog-faced fruit bat was homogenized in a mortar. the supernatant was used for oral infection. quantitative real-time PCR was performed by using 0.5 L total RNA and the PrimeScript RT Reagent Kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan) the temperature program consisted of an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. extracted RNA was eluted in 50 L of RNase-free water. for cDNA synthesis, RNA (5 L), a random hexamer, and a superScript III kit were used. PCR and DNA Sequencing All cDNA samples obtained from field bats were tested by using conventional and nested PCR. XL DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) designed primer pairs for the Bat-CoV/Philippines/Diliman1552G1/2008 sequence (5\u2032-TGATTTCTGCAATGATACTTGGTTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ACTTGATGATCTGTAACAACAATCG-3\u2032) the primers were used as the inner primer set for the nested PCR after the first PCR was performed with primers 1 and 2. experimentally infected bats were examined daily for clinical signs of infection. all bats were killed after being anesthetized with diethyl ether. serum samples were obtained from a clean plastic sheet spread along bottom of the cage. the temperature program consisted of an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. the primer pair for the real-time PCR was designed on the basis of the partial RdRp sequences of bat-CoV/Philippines/Diliman1525G2/2008. no. intestine samples tested No. positive (group 1) No. positive (group 2) Los Baos Lesser dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis) 4 0 2 Cave nectar bat (Eonycteris spelaea) 3 0 2 Greater musky fruit bat (Ptenochirus jagori) 14 0 11 Diliman (site A) Cave nectar bat (E. spelaea) 1 0 a 440-bp consensus nt sequence of group 2 CoVs was also obtained (>98% nt identity with each other) a phylogenetic tree was constructed with the partial RdRp-deduced amino acid sequence (120 aa) and available sequences of known CoVs. avirus (HCoV) 229E (HCoV-229E) (NC_002645), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (NC_003436), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (NC_002306), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (AY994055), bat-CoV/A512/2005 (NC_009657), bat-CoV/A620/2005 (DQ648822), twenty additional amplicons (200-bp sequences) were obtained by using primers specific for group 2d bat CoVs. all sequences of group 1b bat CoVs were obtained from insectivorous bats (4/7, 57.1%), and all sequences of group 2d bat CoVs were obtained from frugivorous bats. oral infection was conducted only with samples positive for the group 2d bat CoV genome. a homogenized large intestine sample (60 mg) was given orally to 2 fruit bats (bats A and B) after confirmation that these bats showed no clinical signs of infection, they were killed 6 days after infection. Virus genome was detected only in the small and large intestines of both bats by RT-PCR. virus RNA not detected; +, virus RNA detected; qRT-PCR, quantitative RT-PCR; ND, not done. RT-PCR, reverse transcription\u2013PCR; \u2013, virus RNA not detected; +, virus RNA detected; ND, not done. the tree showed the same topology as that constructed with deduced amino acid sequence of the partial RdRP gene. the nucleotide sequence was most similar to that of bat-CoV/HKU9\u20131/China/2007 (72% identity). read 1 was obtained by using reverse transcription\u2013PCR and HKU9-Leader42\u201364 and N468\u2013448r primers. a 60-mg sample of the small intestine from bat A was given orally to 2 bats (bats C and D), and 500 L of phosphate-buffered saline was given orally to 1 bat (bat E) as a control. clinical signs were not observed in the experimentally infected bats. cDNA was synthesized from bat samples obtained after experimental infection. a total of 52 bats were obtained at 3 locations in Diliman and 1 location in the Philippines. RT-PCRs for a 440-bp fragment in the RdRp gene of CoVs were performed for large intestine samples. 9 (17.3%) of 52 bats were positive. intestine samples tested no. positive (group 1) No. positive (group 2) Los Baos Lesser dog-faced fruit bat (Cynopterus brachyotis) 3 0 2 Greater musky fruit bat (Ptenochirus jagori) 14 0 11 Diliman (site A) Cave nectar bat (E. spelaea) 1 0 1 Greater musky fruit bat (P. jagori) 1 0 0 Geoffroy rousette bat the partial RdRp sequence was most similar to that of bat-CoV/China/A515/2005 (95% nt identity with each other) a 440-bp consensus nt sequence of group 2 CoVs was also obtained (>98% nt identity with each other) and deposited in GenBank as Bat-CoV/Philippines/Diliman1525G2/2008. human coronavirus (HCoV) 229E (HCoV-229E) (NC_002645), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (NC_003436), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (NC_002306), feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) (AY994055), human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (NC_005831), bat-CoV/A512 virus (SARS-human) (NC_004718), civet SARS-like coronavirus (SARS-civet) (AY304488), bat-SARS-like coronavirus HKU3 (bat-SARS-CoV HKU3) (NC_009694), infectious bronchitis virus (NC_001451), and turkey coronavirus (AF124991). the volume of intestine samples collected from insectivorous bats was less than that from fruit bats because of their body size. a homogenized large intestine sample (60 mg) was given orally to 2 fruit bats (bats A and B) after confirmation that these bats showed no clinical signs of infection, they were killed 6 days after infection. values are copies per milligram.

RNA of group 1b bat CoV was detected in 4 (57.1%) of 7 insectivorous bats. all bats positive for group 1b bat CoV belonged to the same species, the Lesser Asiatic yellow bat (Scotophilus kuhlii) the partial RdRp sequence of the virus was most similar to that of bat-CoV/China/A515/2005. we tried to isolate bat CoVs from several cell lines and primary cultured cells. however, virus replication was not observed, which is consistent with results of a previous report (17). compared with primary infection by field samples obtained from C. brachyotis, the level of viral genome amplification was low. this finding may have been caused by a difference in viral replication in bats of different species."}
