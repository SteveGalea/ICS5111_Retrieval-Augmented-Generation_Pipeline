{"summary": "neurotropic viruses are among the most common congenital infections in newborns. viral infections in the central nervous system are hypothesized to indirectly contribute to neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases later in life due to damage from a previous infection (e.g. schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease) neonatal immune response induces a distinct cytokine profile when compared to an adult response against the same pathogen. a Th1 response would be preferred in order to ensure adequate IFN expression and control viral replication in developing neurons. however, IFN also plays both neurotoxic and neuroprotective roles for developing neurons. mice were kept on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. mice were infected with measles virus (MV)-Edmonston obtained from the ATCC. adult mice (3\u20134 months of age) were anesthesized with isoflurane and injected with 30 l (30,000 PFU) of MV along the cerebral midline. infected mice were monitored for signs of illness daily throughout the course of infection. assays were used in combination with a 7900 HT sequence detection system. cycling conditions were 95 \u00b0C, 15 min, followed by 40 (twostep) cycles. slope was 23.54, corresponding to a PCR efficiency of 95%. mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane. the brain and spleen were removed and pressed through a nylon mesh cell strainer in PBS. the dissociated tissue was run over a 30/70% discontinuous Percoll gradient for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. immunohistochemistry of mouse brain tissue Neonatal and adult mice were anesthetized and perfused with 4% Paraformaldehyde/PBS (PFA/PBS) brains from MV-infected and mock-infected mice were collected and cut along the midline into two halves. Western blot Adult and neonatal CD46+ mice were anesthetized with 3.8% choral hydrate in PBS and perfused with ice-cold PBS with 10 mM sodium fluoride as a phosphatase inhibitor. membranes were washed thrice in PBS-Tween and imaged on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, version 3.1.4) the membranes were washed thrice with PBS-Tween for 10 min each and incubated in secondary antibody solutions. tokine and chemokine gene expression was assessed using the mouse cytokine and chemokine RT2 Profiler PCR Arrays (PAMM-150Z, Qiagen) the expression of 84 inflammatory genes and 5 housekeeping genes were assessed. data analysis was done using the SABiosciences RT2 Profiler Web-Based PCR Array Data Analysis software. mice were kept on a 12:12 light/dark cycle with free access to food and water. harem mating cages were established to generate neonatal pups for infections. RNA was transcribed using a mixture of anchored oligo-dT and random decamers. aliquot of the cDNA was used for 59-nuclease assays. qRT-PCR analysis of pathogen recognition receptors and interferons was performed. mRNA was quantified as CT values relative to GAPDH. mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane. APC NK1.1 (55067), FITC CD19 (557398), PE CD4 (553048) and PerCP-CYTM 5.5 CD3 Molecular complex (560527) all antibodies were added at a concentration of 600 ng/ml. each sample, 1 105 events were run, with gates to exclude debris and doublet cells. sagittal cryosections (16 M) were cut on a cryostat (Microm HM-550, GMI) standard immunohistochemistry was performed to detect mouse anti-measles hemagglutinin (Millipore MAB8905; 1:200), mouse measles matrix protein (Millipore MAB8910; 1:200) and rabbit anti-ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule 1 (Iba1) for microgli brains were harvested and dissected for the hippocampus and cerebellum. lysed in 1 Cell Lysis Buffer (Cell Signaling Technology, Danvers) with 1 Protease Inhibitor cocktail. protein lysates were stored at 80 \u00b0C until analysis. the membranes were washed thrice in PBS-Tween and imaged on the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (Licor Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, version 3.1.4) the signal from each band was normalized against the GAPDH signal as a loading control. primary antibodies used were as follows: rat anti-TLR3 (Novus Biologicals NBP2-27404; 1:250); rat anti-TLR7 (R&D Systems MAB7156 analysis Statistical analysis for the Kaplan-Meier plots was performed by log rank test to compare survival across different genotypes. p values were calculated based on a student's t-test to compare control and treatment groups. MV-infected neonates succumbed to the virus by 16 dpi, with 50% mortality by 8 dpi. MV-infected neonates showed signs of illness including dehydration. bars represent the average of mice from three independent experiments (n = 9\u201314) and error bars represent SD. previous studies have shown that IFN-producing T cells are required for MV control in adult CD46+ mice. MV replication is greater in the absence of IFN, thereby leading to more rapid death. expression of measles virus nucleocapsid (N) RNA was determined in brain tissue using qRT-PCR. despite immune background, MV RNA increased in all neonates over time. MV-infected neonates lose body weight at 4 dpi (11.7% loss compared to uninfected controls) at 10 dpi, MV-infected CD46+ and CD46+/IFN-KO showed a significant decrease in brain and body weight compared to age-matched controls. weights occurred independently of IFN, even when edema was not present. but at 10 dpi, the ratio increases in CD46+/IFN-KO neonates. despite the reduction in brain weights in the absence of IFN, there is also a greater reduction in body weights at 10 dpi. microglia were identified by CD45intermediate/CD11b+ staining and macrophages by CD45high/CD11b+ in the brain by flow cytometry. in CD46+/IFN-KO and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates, there is a significant increase in microglial numbers from 4 to 6 dpi. whole brains from MV-infected and uninfected control CD46+ neonates (C) and CD46+/IFN-KO neonates (D) were collected at 7 dpi. slides from 4 to 5 mice per condition were examined. MV antigen was observed in the prefrontal cortex, thalamus, and cerebellum at 7 dpi regardless of IFN expression. at the later stages of infection (10 dpi), there is widespread MV infection throughout the CNS, including involvement of the hippocampus. microglia/macrophages with bright Iba1 staining were consistently observed in close proximity to MV-infected neurons. at 2 and 4 dpi, there is no significant difference in MV-infected pups. there is a significant increase in total NK cell number (NK1.1+, CD49b+, and NK1.1+/CD49b+) in MV-infected neonates compared to uninfected controls in both CD46+ and CD46+/IFN-KO. neutrophils are recruited early in viral infections. they can contribute to tissue damage through protease and oxidase release. neutrophil infiltration is significantly higher compared to CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates. at 4 dpi, there is no difference in the number of CD4 or CD8 T cells in the infected CD46+ neonates compared to uninfected controls. there is higher infiltration of CD4 or CD8 T cells in the absence of IFN early in infection at 4 dpi. at 7 dpi, significant CD4 T cell infiltration was observed only in the CD46+/IFN-KO pups in comparison to uninfected controls. CD46+ and CD46+/IFN-KO neonates were quantified at 4 (A, B), 7 (C, D), and 10 dpi (E, F). results represent pups from 4 to 5 different litters. CD46+ neonates and the CD46+/IFN-KO mice lack adequate CD4+ T cell helper function. CD4 T cell infiltration in the CNS is greater in MV-infected adults than in neonates. transgenic mice expressing Hsp70, and TLR 3 and 7 recognize viral RNAs. both CD46+ and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates upregulate RIGI mRNA. infected neonates showed significantly higher expression of RIGI mRNA. qRT-PCR analysis of the whole brain was performed for RIGI (A, B), TLR3 (E, F), and TLR7 (I, J) mRNA expression is shown as the fold-change normalized to the CD46+ uninfected controls. mRNA expression is shown as the fluorescence signal for each protein quantified and normalized to GAPDH. fected neonatal cerebellum (6.3-fold) versus uninfected controls. findings suggest changes in whole brain mRNA do not necessarily correlate with protein expression in brain regions that carry a high viral load. neonates, but not adults, induce RIGI expression in the brain tissue during infections. qRT-PCR analysis was performed for IFN4 (A, B), IFN (C, D) and MDA5 (E, F) at 7 dpi, only the CD46+/IFN-KO neonates significantly upregulated MDA5. mRNA expression of 84 cytokine and chemokines genes in MV-infected neonates is not appropriate for viral control. we hypothesized that neonates may express a Th2-biased cytokine response in the CNS, as has been noted in many peripheral infections. gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in MV-infected neonatal and adult brains. changes in gene expression that were more than two-fold relative to the uninfected controls are shown. ligand 3 3.73 0.021 3.22 0.0003 IL1 Interleukin 1 beta 3.27 0.027 3.04 0.014 Ccl2 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 15.33 0.042 Ccl7 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 9.31 0.017 Tnf Tumor necrosis factor 8.38 0.016 IL12b Interleukin 12B 7.87 0.02 Osm Oncostat interleukin 10 (IL-10), a global suppressor of the immune response, was the only Th2-related cytokine to be upregulated in MV-infected neonates. MV-infected adults also expressed unique inflammatory genes that were not activated in the neonates. gene expression in uninfected neonates revealed modest baseline differences in the absence of infection. qRT-PCR array analysis was performed using the RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Array. all data were normalized against levels of housekeeping genes within the same sample. ligand 2 15.33 0.042 35.89 0.018 493.99 0.001 Ccl7 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 7 9.31 0.017 16.46 0.024 164.18 0.024 Tnf Tumor necrosis factor 8.36 0.016 17.9 0.007 72.05 0.009 IL12b Interleukin 12B 7.87 0.02 15.28 0.008 199.93 0.03 Osm Oncostatin ligand 22 6.18 0.012 Ccl19 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 19 5.55 0.0002 IL5 Interleukin 5 3.68 0.03 Ccl17 Chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 17 3.56 0.04 CNTF Ciliary neurotrophic factor 3.31 0.008 IL3 Interleukin 3 3.09 0.04 Tnfsf13b TNF (ligand) superfamily, member 13b 2. cytokines (IL-5, IL-7, IL-15, and bone morphogenic proteins) and chemokines (CCL11, CCL17, CCL19, CCL22, CXCL16) were induced only in CD46+/RAG2-KO brains upon infection. however, comparison of the baseline gene expression between uninfected neonates demonstrates that CD46+/RAG2-KOs have lower basal expression of some of the factors that are upregulated during infection +/RAG2-KO neonates express cytokine profile that includes factors controlled in an age-dependent manner in the immunocompetent CD46+ mice. expression of IFN mRNA was higher in CD46+ neonates compared to CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates. CD46+ adults induced greater CIITA expression (11-fold) compared to uninfected and MV-infected mice. despite elevated IFN expression during infection, transcription of IFN-responsive genes is age-dependent. neonatal mice lacking IFN showed prolonged survival in comparison to untreated mice. IFN-treated mice showed limited immune cell infiltration. the numbers of CD4 T cells in the brain was reduced with IFN treatment. mice from 3 to 5 different litters were compared for each condition. each bar represents the average number of T cells per 1 105 events. the error bars represent SEM. MV-infected neonates succumbed to the virus by 16 dpi. MV-infected neonates showed signs of illness including dehydration, lethargy, and tremors starting at 6dpi. MV-infected CD46+/IFN-KO pups succumb to the infection earlier than CD46+ pups, reaching 100% mortality by 10 dpi. we also investigated the role of the adaptive immune system in neonates using recombinase activating gene 2 knockout mice (CD46+/RAG2-KO) MV RNA increased in all neonates over time, although this increase was only significant in CD46+ pups (p 0.001) the level of viral RNA did not correlate with survival in the CD46+ neonates. this result suggests that the virus may not be directly causing death in neonates, but rather the nature of the host immune response may be a better predictor of survival. MV-infected CD46+/IFN-KO neonates lose body weight at 4 dpi. a transient increase in body (13.5%) and brain weight (6.2%; p 0.05) at 6 dpi. there is no difference in body weights compared to control. despite the reduction in brain weights in the absence of IFN, there is also a greater reduction in body weights at 10 dpi. the body weights (A, B) and brain weights (C, D) of CD46+ (A, C) and CD46+/IFN-KO neonates lose body and brain weight during infection. in CD46+/IFN-KO and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonatal brains, there is a significant increase in microglial numbers from 4 to 6 dpi. compared across the genotypes, we observe that CD46+/IFN-KO neonates have the highest number of microglia at 6 dpi compared to CD46+ and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates. whole brains from MV-infected and uninfected control CD46+ neonates (C) and CD46+/IFN-KO neonates (D) were collected at 7 dpi. slides from 4 to 5 mice per condition were examined. microglia/macrophages with bright Iba1 staining were consistently observed in close proximity to MV-infected neurons. Iba1+ cells in uninfected brains show thin, ramified processes and with less intense Iba1 staining. changes in microglia/macrophage morphology are observed in the absence of IFN, suggesting that other cytokines/chemokines can trigger activation during infection. NK cells arrive in the CNS during infection independently of IFN. whole brain homogenates from MV-infected neonates were analyzed for total natural killer (NK) cell numbers at 2, 4 and 6 dpi. in neonates that lack IFN, neutrophil (CD45hi, CD11b+, and Ly6G+) infiltration is significantly higher compared to CD46+ neonates at 4 and 6 dpi. this suggests that IFN may downregulate neutrophil recruitment in the CD46+ neonates during infection. there is higher infiltration of CD4 T cells in the absence of IFN early in infection at 4 dpi. at 7 dpi, significant CD4 T cell infiltration was observed only in the absence of IFN. at later stages of infection (10 dpi), significant infiltration of CD4 (Fig. 5E) and CD8 T cells was observed only in the CD46+/IFN-KO pups. the black line represents the mean number of cells for each group. results represent pups from 4 to 5 different litters. Statistical analysis was applied by two-way ANOVA. whole brain homogenates from neonatal and adult CD46+ mice were analyzed for infiltrating T cells at 7 dpi. Flow cytometry was performed for CD4 T cells (CD3+/CD4+/CD19) or CD8 T cells (CD8+/CD19) mice from 4 to 5 different litters were compared. both CD46+ and CD46+/RAG2-KO neonates upregulate RIGI mRNA. infected neonates showed significantly higher expression of RIGI mRNA. CD46+ neonates did not upregulate either TLR3 or TLR7 mRNA. qRT-PCR analysis of whole brain was performed for RIGI (A, B), TLR3 (E, F), and TLR7 (I, J). mRNA expression is shown as the fold-change normalized to the CD46+ uninfected controls (n = 4\u20135 mice/condition). mRNA expression is shown as the fluorescence signal for each protein quantified and normalized to GAPDH (n = 3\u20134 mice/condition). neonates, but not adults, induce RIGI expression in the brain. PRR signaling can trigger the expression of Type I IFNs. early in infection, we did not observe significant expression of IFN. at 7 dpi, only the CD46+/IFN-KO neonates significantly upregulated MDA5. this may correlate with the elevated IFN4 observed at this time point. the less effective immune response in neonates is not attributable to a diminished Type I IFN response. mRNA expression of 84 cytokine and chemokines genes in neonatal brains is not appropriate for viral control. we hypothesized that neonates may express a Th2-biased cytokine response in the CNS. these findings suggest that the expression of many inflammatory genes is not appropriate for viral control. gene expression of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines in MV-infected neonatal and adult brains. qRT-PCR array analysis was performed using the RT2 ProfilerTM PCR Array. interleukin 10 (IL-10), a global suppressor of the immune response, was the only Th2-related cytokine to be upregulated in MV-infected neonates. interleukin 10 (IL-10), a global suppressor of the immune response, was the only Th2-related cytokine to be upregulated in MV-infected neonates. adult mice show increased expression of the IFN-inducible gene CXCL9 (17.67-fold) gene expression in uninfected neonates and adults revealed modest baseline differences in the absence of infection. of these cytokines, IL-12a was the only factor to be upregulated by the neonates upon infection. all data were normalized against levels of housekeeping genes within the same sample. all data were normalized against levels of housekeeping genes within the same sample.
