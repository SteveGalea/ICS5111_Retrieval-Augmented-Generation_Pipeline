{"summary": "cardiac neoplasms present with one or more of the triad of constitutional, obstructive and embolic symptoms. for a cardiac myxoma to present as infective endocarditis is a rare occurrence, with limited cases reported in the literature. the patient was treated for presumed infective endocarditis and improved clinically. his inflammatory markers also improved with serial reductions in white cell count (WCC) and C reactive protein (CRP) transthoracic echocardiography showed a large mass in the left atrium attached to interatrial septum and prolapsing through mitral valve. there was no evidence of mitral regurgitation; other valves were grossly normal and left ventricular ejection fraction was >55%. primary cardiac tumours have a frequency of approximately 0.02%,3. myxoma accounts for 50%\u201380% of primary cardiac neoplasms. most common location is the left atrium, with right atrial involvement being rare. an updated review of 39 cases between 1998 and 2014 had similar findings. infected myxomas have relative more occasions of high-grade fever, multiple embolic events and the presence of refractory microorganisms."}
