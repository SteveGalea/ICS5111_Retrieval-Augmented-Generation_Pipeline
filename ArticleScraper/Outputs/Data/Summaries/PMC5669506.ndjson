{"summary": "prospective study was conducted among pilgrims from different arab nations. participants included 736 Saudi pilgrims (436 males and 300 females) and 1384 non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims (1384; 909 males and 475 females) were included in the study. the clinical epidemiology of MERS-CoV cases showed similarity to the seasonal flu. severe cases have been reported in elderly individuals and immune compromised patients with underlying conditions. the current study aimed to evaluate the level of knowledge and awareness of pilgrims regarding the MERS-CoV. a total number of 2120 participants including 736 Saudi and non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims (1384; 909 males and 475 females) were included in the study. both groups of pilgrims (n: 2120) were first screened for the overall knowledge and awareness toward MERS-CoV. results showed incorrect knowledge and awareness when asking the whole pilgrims about the following information: MERS-CoV appears in certain time in the year, MERS-CoV is a fatal disease to any person, the animal source of the disease, probability of camel meat and milk to transmit the disease. the Saudi pilgrims showed significant differences in the level of knowledge than non-Saudi Arabian pilgrims in the following topics. the nature of MERS-CoV (79.35% vs. 61.78%, %, P = 0.042), the signs of the disease and its similarity to flu (78.94 vs. 65.17%, P 0.001) and the animals that could transmit the disease. the major source of information of the participants included the official websites of health organizations followed by the social media. non-Saudi pilgrims showed a good level of the overall knowledge about the nature of MERS-CoV. asymptomatic and symptomatic health-care workers play an important role in spreading the illness among hospitalized patients. the majority of both Saudi and non-Saudi pilgrims were aware of the necessity of monitoring for MERS-CoV upon exposure to the infected persons. awareness level was higher in Saudi pilgrims in comparison to no Saudi ones. in both groups misperceptions toward high-risk believes still exist. the relatively lower level of knowledge among non-Saudi Arab pilgrims toward MERS-CoV may necessitate enhancing the health authorities in their countries of origin to take more active role in sharing the health information about the disease."}
