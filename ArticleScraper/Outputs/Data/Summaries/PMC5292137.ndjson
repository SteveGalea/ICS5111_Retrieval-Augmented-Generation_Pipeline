{"summary": "a novel human coronavirus, named middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was first reported in Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. development of a rapid and reliable kit was crucial to prevent further spread of MERS-CoV. we present two real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assays. middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a new and unknown origin respiratory virus with genotypic and phenotypic diversity. this virus can mutate, increasing its virulence and even causing tissue tropism. humans are known to maintain circulation of four different human coronaviruses at a global population level. the first cases of MERS-CoV infections reported in Iran were two cases in Kerman, a city in southeast Iran. the morbidity and mortality rate of this infection is alarming (7). there are no specific treatments or effective drugs for this deadly disease, and no vaccine. the DNA templates from upE and ORF1b of novel human coronavirus were amplified and confirmed using the corresponding real-time PCR specific probes and primers (forward and reverse) of each signature. both RNA transcripts were purified using Roche High Pure Viral RNA Kit and quantified by ultraviolet light spectroscopy. step rRT-PCR assay was developed using the QuantiFast RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on Corbet (Rotor-Gene) 6000 (Qiagen, Germany) real-time PCR instrument. each 25 L reaction mixture contained 12.5 L of 2 Master Mix, 1 L of reverse transcriptase/Taq DNA polymerase mixture, 5 L of RNA, 400 nM concentrations of upE probe two transcribed candidate signatures (target regions) upE and ORF1b, were used in both assays. the highest dilution of upE RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection. the highest dilution of ORF1b RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the ORF1b assay. primer/probe sequences were evaluated against an additional eight recently published genome sequences from seven patients collected from June 2012 to May 2013. rRT-PCR assay was developed using the QuantiFast RT-PCR kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) on Corbet 6000 (Qiagen, Germany) real-time PCR instrument. each 25 L reaction mixture contained 12.5 L of 2 Master Mix, 1 L of reverse transcriptase/Taq DNA polymerase mixture. upE forward primer (GCAACGCGCGCGCGATTCAGTT) and upE reverse primer (GCCTCTACACGGGACCCATA) were mixed with upE probes. rRT-PCR kits should all provide satisfactory results with default reaction mix compositions. sensitivity evaluation was optimized by testing candidate probes and primers in the ORF1b signature assay. the highest dilution of upE RNAs at which replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the ORF1b assay. sensitivity evaluation was optimized by testing candidate probes and primers in the ORF1b signature assay. the highest dilution of upE RNAs at which replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the ORF1b assay. primer/probe sequences were evaluated against an additional eight recently published genome sequences from seven patients collected from June 2012 to May 2013. results 4.1. Confirmation of Synthesized DNA Template of upE and ORF1b. the results of RNA transcripts (containing upE signature) were confirmatory. this test can conclusively detect MERS-CoV infection bebecause it is a highly specific assay. the stages of sensitivity (minimum detection limit) determination for each of these genes were done separately and the real-time RT-PCR assays showed different sensitivities for upE and ORF1b target regions. the highest dilution of upE RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the upE assay. the minimum detection limit of the assay signature was fewer than ten copies of standard RNAs per reaction. a length of 80 bp; lane 3, negative control; C, lanes 1 and 2, synthesized DNA template (plasmid) containing upE and ORF1b regions; lane 3, 1 Kb DNA Ladder (Fermentas) MERS-CoV infection bebecause it is a highly specific assay. results of RNA transcripts (containing ORF1b signature) were confirmatory. similar to those of synthetic standard RNAs. the highest dilution of upE RNAs at which all replicates were positive was defined as the limit of detection (LoD) for the upE assay. the minimum detection limit of the assay signature was fewer than ten copies of standard RNAs per reaction. the best methods for detection of MERS-CoV are real-time RT-PCR assays, for upE gene as the initial screening of disease and for ORF1b gene as the final confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. traditional (gel-based) RT-PCR methods require amplification in a thermo cycler (after cDNA preparation via RT process) and product analysis by electrophoresis gel, both of which are time-consuming and laborious. rRT-PCR assays enables both steps to be accomplished in a single step. this increases the sensitivity of the assays and is affordable economically. we also inaugurated a cell-free system to transcribe these RNAs using the synthesized DNA templates."}
