{"summary": "DOCTORS OF ANOTHER CALLING Dr. David K. C. Cooper has edited a splendid book describing in detail 35 physicians who became famous not in medicine but in a nonmedical arena (1). each chapter describes one of these distinguished men (no women were among the 35), and an appendix entitled \u201cWho Could Have Been Chosen\u201d provides a lengthy list of physician writers, entertainers, explorers, athletes, politicians, military men, humanitarians, and educators. several physicians became poets, including John Keats (1795\u20131821) and Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809\u20131894). other writers included Conan Doyle (1859\u20131930), who created Sherlock Holmes. archibald Joseph Cronin (1896\u20131981), a bestselling novelist and humanitarian. the handshake represents a deeply established social custom. in recent years, there has been increasing recognition of the importance of hands as vectors for infection. regulations to restrict the handshake from the health care setting may help limit the spread of disease and thus could decrease the clinical and economic burden associated with hospital-acquired infections. the average cost to fully vaccinate a child with private insurance to the age of 18 has increased from $100 to $2200. the most expensive shot for young children is Prevnar 13, which prevents diseases caused by pneumococcal bacteria from ear infections to pneumonia. prevnar 13, which protects against 13 strains, has gone up 6% each year since it was approved by the fda in 2010. some of the new vaccines are complicated to manufacture. 18% of american adults, or 42 million, were cigarette smokers in 2012, down from 28% in 1992. just 16% of high school students in the us smoked cigarettes, down from 36% in the peak year of 1997, according to the CDC. 25% of students were in physical fights in 2013, down from 42% in 1991; 32% watched 3 hours of TV daily, down from 43% in 1999. condom use among the sexually active (about one-third of teens) dropped to 7% from a peak of 9% in 2003. 2.1 billion people, or about 29% of the world's population, were either overweight (body mass index 26\u201330 kg/m2) or obese (body mass index >30) (9). in 1980, 857 million of the world's population was overweight or obese. in developing countries, 13% of boys and 13% of girls were overweight or obese. ine meat prices are expected to well outpace prices for chicken. some of the world's largest chicken-eating countries per capita are those that consume almost no pork. a 125-POUND WOMAN DOWNS 144 OUNCES OF BOVINE MUSCLE IN 15 MINUTES. the top 10 countries for male life expectancy in years: Iceland, 81.2; Switzerland, 80.7; Australia, 80.5; Israel, 80.2; New Zealand, 80.2; Italy, 80.2; Japan, 80.0; and Sweden, 80.0; and Luxembourg, 79.7. the CDC is helping to fund a panel of medical specialists to review the scientific data on sleep. the new guidelines will be drawn by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, the Sleep Research Society, and the CDC. most current guidelines say school-aged children should get at least 10 hours of sleep a night and teenagers, 9 to 10. about 70% of american adults get less sleep on workdays than they say they need. the country's fertility rate has dropped to a record low of 63 births per 1000 women of childbearing age. global sales of these incontinence products are growing at a rate of 84% annually, faster than paper-based household products. as many as 25 million americans, or about 1 in 10 adults, have some form of urinary incontinence. Paul de Kruif, a veterinarian and bacteriologist, called Meyer the most versatile microbe hunter since Pasteur. he worked at the Rockefeller Institute in the u.s. for more than 3 decades. he showed that botulism was a highly resistant spore found in soils across the u.s. in the 1930s California's rapid population growth and the incursion of settlers into valleys and deserts teeming with arthropod-bearing parasites and exotic fungi presented new and unexpected disease challenges. he had to convince skeptical public health officials of the threat that animals, whether in the form of dairy herds (Brucellosis), parakeets (psittacosis) or ground squirrels (sylvatic plague), posed psittacosis was transmitted by parrots, before Meyer. he found that psittacosis was endemic to aviaries in southern California. psittacosis was an endemic infection of wild shell parakeets. by 1934, Meyer had tested nearly 30,000 parakeets and certified 185 California aviaries as psittacosis-free. by 1935, Meyer himself breached protocol when he removed his rubber gloves to take a phone call and developed psittacosis. a year after his fall, he died from complications of advanced malignant melanoma. he was a member of the Institute of Medicine of the national Academy of Sciences. his essay describes his hospital experiences after an accident on June 27, 2013, 10 days after his 90th birthday. a quarter of the wildlife in south Florida is exotic, more than anywhere else in the world. invasive species are probably the second biggest threat to endangered animals after habitat loss. invasives could cost the US as much as $120 billion a year in damages. a biologist in canada calls what's happening \"global swarming\" the balance of nature is seemingly being upended. humans brought their favorite plants and animals with them, along with stowaways like black rats. more than one-quarter of plants in Vermont and more than one-third in Massachusetts come from outside those states. invasive wildlife enters the state through the sprawling Miami International Airport, which ranks first in the US in international freight shipments and live-animal traffic. the sheer number of alien species entering Florida on any given day tilts the odds in the species\u2019 favor. the invasive species has spread to every corner of the world and every kind of climate. it displaces natives, leaving extinction in its wake, altering habitats to suit its needs. more hospitals see so-called \u201cbundled\u201d payments as the wave of the future. geisinger's coronary bypass bundle reduced costs by 5% and reduced mortality rate by 67%. the only health plan using the bundle is its own, a nonprofit health maintenance organization with nearly 450,000 members. commercial insurers have been slow to embrace bundled care because it requires them to process claims differently. federal funding for GME amounts to nearly $16 billion annually. Medicare's contribution to GME is $9.5 billion, nearly $3 billion for direct medical education to pay the salaries of residents and supervising physicians. federal Medicaid spending adds another $2 billion for GME, and an additional $4 billion comes from the Veterans Health Administration and the Health Resources and Services Administration. the biggest spenders in 2013 included pharmaceuticals/health products, $226,114,456; followed by insurance, oil, and gas, computers/Internet, electric utilities, and TV/movies/music. these authors surveyed 64,000 people in 13 nations; two-thirds said the world would be a better place if men thought more like women. authors sampled 32,000 people to classify 125 different behavioral traits as masculine, feminine, or neither. they found a strong consistency across countries in what was perceived as feminine, masculine, or neither. they found a strong consistency across countries in what was perceived as feminine, masculine, or neither. authors found that feminine traits correlated more strongly with making the world a better place than masculine traits. they found that an ideal leader must be a long-term thinker who plans for the future to bring about sustainable solutions, rather than posturing for expediency. they found that being loyal (feminine) was more important than being proud (masculine) eight of the 30 largest cities are in countries that the world bank defines as high-income. in 1950, new york was the largest urban area in the world, with just over 12 million residents. GARRISON KEILLOR A Prairie Home Companion is the live radio variety show. he is a storyteller extraordinaire and his latest work, The Keillor Reader, is a treat. in 2013, there were 81 accidents and 210 fatalities, down from 90 accidents and 685 fatalities in 2009, according to the international air transport association. in 2014, Charles Murray published The Curmudgeon's Guide to Getting Ahead: dos and don'ts of right behavior, Tough thinking, Clear Writing, and Living a Good Life (28). he is best known for his controversial book The Bell Curve, coauthored with Richard Herrnstein in 1994, which argues class and race are linked \"On the Formation of Who You Are\" has the following chapters: Leave home; Recalibrate your perspective on time; Get real jobs; Confront your inner hothouse flower; Think about what kind of itches need scratching; Being judgmental is good; Don't ruin your love affair with yourself."}
