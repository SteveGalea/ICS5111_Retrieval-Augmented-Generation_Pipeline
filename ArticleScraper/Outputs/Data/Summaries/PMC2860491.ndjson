{"summary": "CHIKV is an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus) it is transmitted to humans primarily by Aedes aegypti, the infamous yellow fever propagator. CHIKV infection is marked by severe joint pain, contorting its victims into unusual postures. the 2005\u20132006 epidemic of CHIKV in la Reunion islands in the Indian Ocean spurred the discovery of a new vector species, Ae. albopictus. this epidemic peaked its devastation between January and February 2006, when over 46,000 cases came into light every week. CHIKV Emergence CHIKV has been isolated into three genotypes based on phylogenetic studies. an estimated 1.3 million people across 13 states were reported to be infected in India [12], [16], and CHIKV was also widespread in Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia [17]. CHIKV was reported in Italy, probably brought in by travelers from CHIKV-prone regions of India, Africa, and Indian Ocean islands such as Mauritius, Madagascar, and seychelles. chronic stage of CHIKF is characterized by polyarthralgia that can last from weeks to years beyond the acute stage. CHIKV has been shown to attack fibroblasts, explaining the involvement of muscles, joints, and skin connective tissues. more than 50% of patients who suffer from severe CHIKF are over 65 y old, and more than 33% die. CHIKV's secondary vector species, Ae. albopictus, supplemented alanine at position 226 with valine (E1-A226V) CHIKV undertakes a complex replication cycle upon host infection. a decline in population of ae. aegypti resulted in an ecological pressure. Ae. albopictus vectored the large epidemic infecting 34% of la Reunion Island's population. all of the CHIKV strains isolated from Mayotte carried the mutation. the mutation was not present at the beginning of the Indian Ocean Islands outbreak. ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus mosquitoes were more susceptible to CHIKV infection by a la R\u00e9union Island isolate. a full-length infectious clone of the CHIKV LR2006 OPY1 strain was tested. despite the method of delivery, 50% of newborns delivered while the mother was infected contracted the disease from their mother. a similar study by Gerardin et al. reported nineteen cases of neonatal infection associated with intrapartum maternal viremia that progressed to develop encephalitis owing to vertical transmission from infected mothers [33]. CHIKV Diagnosis Clinical and epidemiological similarities with dengue fever make CHIKV diagnosis difficult. CHIKV can be detected and isolated by culturing with mosquito cells (C6/36), Vero cells (mammalian), or in mice [26]. this method can take at least a week and only achieves a high sensitivity during the viremic phase. RT-PCR is a faster and more sensitive method that can be used within the first week of disease onset. RANTES levels were significantly suppressed in severe CHIKF patients. results suggest RANTES could be a distinctive biomarker. CHIKF is treated symptomatically, usually with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. a live CHIKV vaccine developed by the united states reached phase II clinical trial. eight percent of the volunteers experienced transient arthralgia. 98% of the volunteers had seroconversion. there is the question as to whether widespread use among the public could trigger mosquito transmission. ly vaccinated with 5.3\u20135.8 log10 PFU of the chimeric vaccines, mice produced strong neutralizing antibody titers. the VEEV and EEEV chimeras seemed to be more immunogenic than the Army vaccine despite the chimeras' lower viremia and replication in the joints of neonatal mice. a result of CHIKV's rapid evolution is difficulty in constructing a vaccine that will be able to effectively protect large populations from multiple strains of the virus. the consensus construct was designed against E1, E2, and the core protein capsid. the construct aligned 21 sequences of CHIKV isolated between 1952 and 2006. DNA vaccinated mice are capable of producing antibodies against the antigens encoded in the DNA vaccine. DNA vaccinated mice are capable of producing antibodies against the antigens encoded in the DNA vaccine. CHIKV mosquito-borne disease has caused massive outbreaks for at least half a century. the NIAID has designated CHIKV as a Category C pathogen alongside the influenza and SARS-CoV viruses. there is currently no vaccine for CHIKV infections. DNA vaccines are a critical component of CHIKV disease control. the dramatic spread of dengue viruses (DENV) across tropical America since 1980 underscores the risk to public health in the Americas.
