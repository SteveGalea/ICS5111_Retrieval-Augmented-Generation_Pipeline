{"summary": "nasopharyngeal swabs collected from symptomatic children with acute respiratory infection (ARI) during household visits and at health facilities. in households (n = 181) with RSV-positive ARI cases, we also identified ARI episodes among other children 5 years old in the same household. children 5 years old were identified through household visits. we enrolled 2348 households with 4012 children as cohort participants. nurses conducted biweekly household visits to check written records. a household with at least 1 RSV-ARI cases in both the 2014 epidemic and the 2015 epidemic was treated as 2 different households. households with at least 1 RSV-ARI case during the study period were excluded from the analysis. the earliest RSV-ARI case in an RSV-HH2 household was termed 1st RSV-ARI. the mean and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by resampling 1000 times in each model. we further estimated basic reproduction number (R0) and 95% CI by using the Wallinga-Teunis approach. nasopharyngeal swabs collected from children with fever and cough. children with respiratory symptoms such as cough, difficulty in breathing, or coryza visited health facilities. the specimens were stored in a viral transport medium at 4\u00b0C. households with at least 1 RSV-ARI case during the study period were excluded from the analysis. the earliest RSV-ARI case in an RSV-HH2 household was termed 1st RSV-ARI. the second RSV-ARI in the same household was termed 2nd RSV-ARI. the mean and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by resampling 1000 times in each model. we further estimated basic reproduction number (R0) and 95% CI by using the Wallinga-Teunis approach [16]. 396 children were 5 years old, including 212 children with RSV-ARI and 184 children without RSV-ARI infection. 152 of the 181 households (84.0%) had 1 RSV-ARI case each (RSV-HH1) and 29 (16.0%) had two or more RSV-ARI cases each. ARI were a potential source of RSV infection for young infants. we further analyzed ARI cases without samples from children 5 years old of RSV-HH1 including preceding ARI or subsequent ARI cases. we assumed these ARI cases were probably due to RSV. 139 (66.5) 87 (57.2) 17 (58.6) 18 (58.1) 261 (62.0) RSV-untypeda 30 (6.5) 12 (5.7) 10 (6.6) 1 (3.4) 1 (3.2) 24 (5.7) total preceding ARI cases (1st RSV-ARI + preceding ARI) for single RSV-ARI and 2nd RSV-ARI in total (n = 183) tal 5 (13.9) 13 (36.1) 18 (50.0) 6\u201311 months old 29 6 months old 0 0 0 6\u201311 months old 0 0 0 1 year old 2 (6.9) 0 2 (6.9) 2\u20134 years old 2 (6.9) 5 (17.2) 7 (24.1) 1 year old 55 6 months old 0 0 6\u201311 months old 1 (1.8) 1 (1.8) 2 (3.6) 1 year old 2 (3.6) 1 (1.8) 3 (5.5) ARI among at-risk 2- to 4-year-old children (32.4%), followed by 1-year-old children (30.3%) this percentage was lower in infants 6 months (11.9%) and 6\u201311 months (19.4%) old. the highest interval frequencies were observed on days 1 and 2 (n = 7; 22.6% each) the estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5\u20133.8), 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5\u20133.9) and 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5\u20134.1) in the gamma, weibull, and log-normal distributions. the estimated values of R0 were higher for RSV-B in 2015 in Caibiran (1.76; 95% CI, 1.62\u20131.83) compared with RSV-A in both municipalities (Kawayan, 1.33; 95% CI, 1.33\u20131.33 and Caibiran, 0.92; 95% CI, 0.92\u20131) and RSV-B in Kawayan (n = 88) in 2014, RSV-A was dominant in both municipalities, whereas in 2015, RSV-B was dominant, with more cases in caibiran. we excluded 97 households from the analysis as shown in the Figure 1. 181 households with 2 or more children 5 years old were further identified, whereas 209 households had only 1 child. st RSV-ARI and 31 2nd RSV-ARI cases had the same date of onset. the infection source of 31 young infants identified as a single RSV-ARI in RSV-HH1 remained unclear. 1.6 1.7 1.4 1.7 1.8 1.6 Age group 6 months old 64 (13.9) 24 (11.5) 31 (20.4) 2 (6.9) 5 (16.1) 62 (14.7) 6\u201311 months old 68 (14.8) 27 (12.9) 25 (16.4) 4 (13.8) 4 (12.9) 60 (14.3) 1 year old 143 (31.1) 70 (33.5) 48 (31.6) 10 (34.5) 7 (22.6) 2\u20134 years old 185 (40.2) 88 (42.1) 48 (3 6 months old 0 0 0 6\u201311 months old 0 0 0 1 year old 2 (6.9) 0 2 (6.9) 2\u20134 years old 2 (6.9) 5 (17.2) 7 (24.1) 1 year old 2 (3.6) 1 (1.8) 3 (5.5) 2\u20134 years old 4 (7.3) 7 (12.7) 16 (29.1) 2\u20134 years old 63 6 months old 2 (3.2) 0 2 (3.2) 6\u201311 months old 3 (4.8) 1 ain 2 households with 3 RSV-ARI cases, 1 child with 1st RSV-ARI was counted twice for each 2nd RSV-ARI. there were 55 total subsequent ARI cases (25.6%), including 31 (14.4%) 2nd RSV-ARI and 24 (11.2%) subsequent ARI cases among 215 children at risk. the percentage of subsequent ARI cases was highest for 1st RSV-ARI and single RSV-ARI among at-risk 2- to 4-year-old children (3 equent ARI (%) 6 months old 33 6 months old 1 0 0 0 6\u201311 months old 0 0 0 1 year old 5 0 0 0 2\u20134 years old 36 2 (5.6) 3 (8.3) 5 (13.9) Subtotal 42 2 (4.8) 3 (7.1) 5 (11.9) 6\u201311 months old 29 6 months old 0 0 0 6\u201311 months old 0 0 0 1 year old 2 1 (50) 1 (50 the highest interval frequencies were observed on days 1 and 2 (n = 7; 22.6% each) the estimated mean serial interval was 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5\u20133.8), 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5\u20133.9) and 3.2 days (95% CI, 2.5\u20134.1) in the gamma, weibull, and log-normal distributions. Approximately 30% of the RSV-positive young infants (6 months old) had possible index cases among children 5 years old in the same household. these results suggested that older children in the same household are an important RSV infection source for young infants. an alternative approach is vaccination of children 6 months old or older. the results of this study also support this assumption. cases with a serial interval of 1 or 2 days might not have gotten the infection from the household index case. we found that R0 varied between times and places. for RSV-B in caibiran in 2015, R0 was high, and significantly large outbreaks were observed in 2015. differences may be due to different factors such as the level of herd immunity. more detailed epidemiological studies are required to understand the complete RSV transmission dynamics. despite these limitations, we managed to gain insight into RSV transmission patterns in a household, especially for young infants. z045_suppl_supplementary_data Click here for additional data file."}
