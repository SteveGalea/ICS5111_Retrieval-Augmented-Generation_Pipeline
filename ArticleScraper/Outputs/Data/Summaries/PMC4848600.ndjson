{"summary": "crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) causes mild to severe hemorrhagic disease (CCHF) exclusively in humans, with case fatality rates of 5%\u201330%. CCHFV exists in an enzootic cycle between ticks and mammals. endemic foci are present over a wide geographic range. CCHFV Genome CCHFV is a member of the genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae, which includes five genera and over 350 virus species. CCHFV is widely distributed throughout the body, and has been detected in spleen, lung, heart, and intestinal tissues in fatal human cases. the nine terminal nucleotides (5\u2032-UCUCAAAGA and 3\u2032-AGAGUUUUCU) are conserved between nairoviruses. each is capable of initiating encapsidation, transcription, replication and packaging of the genomes into nascent virions. CCHFV virion contains a tri-sense, single-stranded RNA (vRNA) genome encapsidated by the nucleoprotein a portion of the newly synthesized NP and L protein are used to replicate the genomic RNA by forming an RNP containing antigenomic RNA (cRNA) the GPC undergoes processing and maturation in the ER and the Golgi. a second protein, the non-structural S (NSS) is encoded in the S segment in the opposite orientation relative to the nucleoprotein (NP) gene. small (1.6 kb), medium (5.4 kb) and large (12.1 kb) segments code for the NP, the GPC and the L protein respectively. the small segment code for a non-structural S protein (NSS) in the positive sense. nucleolin serves as a receptor for the respiratory syncytial virus. CCHFV entry requires clathrin and the clathrin pit adaptor protein-2 complex. entry requires clathrin and the clathrin pit adaptor protein-2 complex. no studies have described the 3\u2032 termini of nairovirus mRNA or elements involved in terminating transcription. the 5\u2032 terminal regions of dugbe virus contain a 7-methylguanylate (m7G) cap with sequences derived from cellular mRNA. CCHFV L protein contains a residue (D693) [25] that is predicted to coordinate a Mn2+ critical for the cap snatching activity. CCHFV GPC maturation yields the structural glycoproteins Gn and Gc, secreted non-structural proteins GP160, GP85, and GP38 [31,51] and the non-structural M protein (NSM) [52]. cRNA of the antigenomic RNPs is used a template to obtain genomic RNPs. preGn cleavage liberates an N-terminal fragment with an apparent total molecular weight on SDS-PAGE of 160 kDa (GP160) and 85 kDa (GP85) GP160/85 is later cleaved by furin in the trans-Golgi network. cleavage of preGn occurs early in the secretory pathway, either in the ER or after its exit to the ER. preGn can traffic to the Golgi complex, the proposed site of CCHFV assembly, in the absence of PreGc [37], but PreGc requires PreGn to exit the ER [37] preGn cleavage at the RRLL motif liberates N-terminal products. GP160/85 can be further cleaved in the trans-Golgi network by furin. cleavage is predicted to free the GP38 domain from the MLD. CCHFV Genome CCHFV is a member of the genus Nairovirus in the family Bunyaviridae. CCHFV is characterized by a tripartite RNA genome of negative polarity. the nine terminal nucleotides are conserved between nairoviruses. CCHFV attaches to an unidentified cellular receptor and enters the cells in a clathrin-dependent manner. the viral genomic segments are uncoated and transcribed into viral mRNA that gain host cell-derived 5\u2032 caps by cap snatching. a portion of the newly synthesized NP and L protein are used to replicate the genomic RNA by forming an RNP containing antigenomic RNA (cRNA) CCHFV have a tri-segmented negative sense RNA genome. the small (1.6 kb), medium (5.4 kb) and large (12.1 kb) segments code for the NP, the GPC and the L protein. the small segment code for a non-structural S protein (NSS) in the positive sense. the details of specific glycoprotein involvement in viral attachment, internalization, and fusion remain unknown. it is suspected that Gc is responsible for binding to the cellular receptors. the predicted fusion loop of CCHFV [38] shares significant homology with RVFV. no studies have described the 3\u2032 termini of nairovirus mRNA or elements involved in terminating transcription. no studies have described the 3\u2032 termini of nairovirus mRNA or elements involved in terminating transcription. capped primers are snatched from cellular mRNA by an endonuclease domain located in the L protein. the encapsidated forms of the cRNA and vRNA are respectively defined as antigenomic and genomic RNPs. a cRNA is synthesized by the L protein and NP subunits are added to the elongating strands to obtain antigenomic RNPs. cRNA of the antigenomic RNPs is used as template to obtain genomic RNPs. the GPC is synthesized in the ER where N-glycosylation occurs (N-glycan) numbers indicate amino acids positions. the signal peptidase and/or the intramembrane cleaving proteases co-translationally cleave GPC close to or within transmembrane domain-2 and -4. the signal peptide is removed, the transmembrane domains of the precursor protein span the ER membrane five times. this step is thought to require the signal peptidase and the intramembrane cleaving proteases (I-CLiPs) before GPC is completely translated, it is cleaved into the Gn precursor (PreGn), the Gc precursor (PreGc), and the NSM. cleavage occurs early in the secretory pathway, either in the ER or after its exit to the cis-Golgi apparatus. cleavage occurs early in the secretory pathway, either in the ER or after its exit to the cis-Golgi apparatus. cleavage is predicted to free GP38 domain from the MLD. CCHFV RNPs are most likely found in the cytoplasm. NP is localized in the perinuclear region close to the Golgi complex. egress occurs from the basolateral membrane in epithelial cells. important insights into the roles of NP were obtained from CCHFV NP crystal structures using CCHFV isolates from Iraq [65] and china [66,67]. the protein structure is more closely related to the NP of arenaviruses [68,69] than to that of other bunyaviruses [70,71,72]. CCHFV NP does not suppress the IFN response to Sendai virus infection [67], a model virus that strongly activates the innate immune responses to double stranded RNA. a fraction of NP is cleaved by caspase-3 at a putative DEVD motif [80] located in the arm domain. CCHFV NSS localizes to the mitochondria and induces apoptosis. the proposed apoptotic functions are based exclusively on the overexpression of NSS. CCHFV glycoproteins appear to be involved in entry and fusion, virion formation and immune evasion. blocking furin cleavage also results in a slight reduction in preGn processing. truncating the CCHFV MLD is dispensable for folding and trafficking of GPC. es have an unusually large L protein (4000 amino acids) compared to those of other family Bunyaviridae members. additional sequences are present in the N-terminal region of nairovirus L proteins that are not found in other Bunyaviridae genomes. se generates a 5\u2032-pRNA by cleaving off the first nucleotide of the 5\u2032 genomic end. this mechanism was previously suggested for the related Hantaan virus. processing of CCHFV genome 5\u2032 termini to a monophosphate group (5\u2032-p) is a possible strategy for evading the innate immune response by blunting the activation of retinoic acid-inducible gene I. CCHFV OTU domain is thought to suppress innate immune signaling by deconjugating Ub or ISG15. overexpression of the CCHFV OTU domain results in reduced general cellular ubiquitination and ISGylation levels. the putative role of the OTU in infection remains paradoxal. ubiquitination of RIG-I by a tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) activates it, whereas ISGylation of RIG-I negatively regulates RIG-I activation by competing with ubiquitination sites. more studies are required to understand how deubiquitination of RIG-I may facilitate viral replication. simultaneous removal of ISG15 moieties from RIG-I may also result in increased antiviral responses. the arm domain protrudes from the globular head domain of CCHFV NP. the globular head domain comprises 23 -helices with an overall structure similar to the NP of Lassa virus (LASV), an arenavirus. oligomerization appears to regulate NP function. CCHFV NP does not suppress the IFN response to Sendai virus infection [67], a model virus that strongly activates the innate immune responses to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) a fraction of NP is cleaved by caspase-3 at a putative DEVD motif [80] located in the apex of the arm domain. CCHFV glycoproteins appear to be involved in entry and fusion. cytoplasmic tail of Gn contains a zinc finger domain that binds RNA in vitro. it is not clear how Gn might interact with RNA and perform matrix protein-like functions. furin cleavage products, GP1 and GP2, are structural components of virions. the GP1 MLD can shield and protect GP2 epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies. the function of the CCHFV MLD may differ significantly from that of filoviruses. conserved motifs contain potential leucine zipper and a zinc finger motif important for binding NP the N-terminal region of the L protein. CCHFV protein domains, motifs and catalytic residues are translated into three proteins. the GPC is proteolytically processed to yield several additional proteins, including Gn and Gc. the type-I IFN response to CCHFV requires RIG-I [88]. the most extensively studied region of the CCHF L protein is the N-terminal OTU domain (residues 1\u2013152) the OTU domain removes ubiquitin (Ub) and Ub-like protein IFN-stimulated gene-15 (ISG15) from their protein substrates. CCHFV OTU domain is thought to suppress innate immune signaling. ubiquitination of Ub (ubiquitination) and ISG15 (ISGylation) regulates IFN signaling. CCHFV OTU overexpression reduces ubiquitination and ISGylation levels. reverse genetics enables the generation of reporter viruses and allows mutational analyses. the minigenome system is non-infectious and does not use full CCHFV genomes. a single terminal G is added to the 5\u2032 RNA termini to enhance T7 activity. the CCHFV minigenome system is composed of a plasmid encoding the minigenome and three helper plasmids encoding the CCHFV NP, L, and T7 RNA polymerase (T7) genes downstream of a RNA polymerase II promoter. vRNA generated by both T7 transcription and RNA replication can be used as templates for transcription of reporter gene mRNA. entry competent CCHFV Virus-like particle systems have also been developed. a VLP contains all viral proteins and a minigenome. the particles in these systems mimic a single-cycle infection. the minigenome plasmid and four helper plasmids encode the T7 polymerase downstream of a cellular RNA polymerase II promoter. the minigenome plasmid is transcribed by T7 and the resulting vRNA is encapsidated to form the genomic RNP. the genomic vRNA is amplified from antigenomic RNPs. rCCHFV infectious clone system functions by co-transfection of genomic plasmids and helper plasmids into cells. the three helper plasmids encode the T7 RNA polymerase, the CCHFV NP and the L genes downstream of cellular RNA polymerase II promoters. the cRNA is encapsidated by NP and L protein to form the antigenomic RNP. CCHFV minigenome system is useful for studying viral transcription, replication, and encapsidation using model RNAs. the minigenome system is non-infectious and does not use full CCHFV genomes. a single terminal G is added to the 5\u2032 RNA termini to enhance T7 activity. the minigenome RNA is encapsidated and acts as a template for replication and transcription. the reporter signal provides a quantitative collective measure of genome replication, transcription and translation. but by using an L protein with a mutated catalytic D693 it is possible to monitor replication alone. vRNA generated by both T7 transcription and RNA replication can be used as templates for transcription of reporter gene mRNA by NP and the L protein. a luminescent signal is produced by hydrolysis of an externally provided reporter substrate. entry competent virus-like particle systems have also been developed. the tec-VLP system is composed of the minigenome plasmid and four helper plasmids that encode the T7 polymerase, CCHFV NP, L, and GPC downstream of a cellular RNA polymerase II promoter. the minigenome plasmid is transcribed by T7 and the resulting vRNA is encapsidated to form the genomic RNP. helper plasmids are provided in trans to synthesize and encapsidate vRNA. after genomic RNPs are obtained, replication and transcription can be driven by NP and L protein produced from viral mRNA. rCCHFV is infectious, all precautions and biosafety level restrictions associated with live CCHFV experimentation must be adhered to. vRNAs from the genomic RNPs are transcribed to mRNA. the CCHFV mRNA are translated into additional NP, L, and GPC. the new rCCHFV must functionally perform all the basic steps of the viral replication cycle. CCHFV glycoprotein function is a critical area of research due to the significant gaps in our knowledge of the essential roles of the glycoproteins in the viral replication cycle. further development of our understanding of the OTU domain will provide key information about CCHFV-mediated innate immune modulation. CCHFV has been recognized as a significant emerging public health threat. a summary of these fields is beyond the scope of this review.
