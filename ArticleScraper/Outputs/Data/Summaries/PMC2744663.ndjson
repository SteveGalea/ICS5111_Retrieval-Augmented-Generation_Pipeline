{"summary": "three samples of pregnant women in their final trimester were recruited from china, Ghana, and the united states. participants completed a survey that included the Life Orientation Test - Revised (LOT-R), the Short Form 12 (SF-12, a quality of life measure), and questions addressing health and demographic factors. pessimism has been shown to have prophylactic effects in certain circumstances. the impact of optimism and pessimism is potentially enormous yet still very unclear. studies have shown levels of optimism/pessimism to vary across cultures. ssimists were those who expected disproportionately negative outcomes associated with their Hepatitis C diagnosis. ssimists were those who expected few negative outcomes associated with their Hepatitis C diagnosis. realists were those who had a fairly accurate perception of the impact Hepatitis C was going to have on their lives. clinics average 500-600 pregnant women per week and 10,000 - 12,000 deliveries per year. patients travel from across Michigan and northern Ohio to seek care. women facing an imminent health crisis or those in active labor excluded. a Demographic and Health Questionnaire was used to measure patient characteristics that may be associated with optimism, pessimism, HRQOL, or pregnancy outcomes. these include age, number of pregnancies, previous treatment for mental health problems, previous use of anti-depressants, and self-perceived health status. the life orientation test is a revision of the original Life Orientation Test [23]. SF-36 items accounted for at least 90% of the variance in PCS-36 and MCS-36 in both general and patient populations. those same 12 items reproduced the profile of the eight SF-36 health concepts sufficiently for studies in which the length of the instrument may be prohibitive. a matching schema was undertaken to attempt to create a sample that was as similar as possible on key variables that could influence optimism/pessimism. previous research has suggested that age can be related to optimism/pessimism [27], as well as number of previous deliveries [20]. a matched sample of 168 women, 56 in each country, were predominantly nulliparous. clinics average 600 pregnant women per week and 3000-3500 deliveries per year. patients from all over Ghana travel to this clinic to receive their care. clinics average 500-600 pregnant women per week and 10,000 - 12,000 deliveries. clinics average 550 pregnant women per week and 3850 deliveries per year. women facing an imminent health crisis or those in active labor excluded. women were given the option to have the survey administered verbally. LOT-R is a revision of the original Life Orientation Test [23]. it assesses optimism/pessimism using a series of questions that inquire about an individual's attitudes in daily life. it has been widely validated [24] and used in both Ghana [25] and china. data were gathered using paper and pencil forms (China, U.S.) and verbal interviews (Ghana) no identifying information was collected from Ghanaian participants. hospital registration numbers were removed from the original survey. \"number of previous pregnancies\" was used as a key variable rather than number of previous deliveries. this resulted in a matched sample of 168 women, 56 in each country. a p-value of.05 was taken to be statistically significant.

LOT-R scores were positively correlated with SF-12 mental health summary scores, vitality subscale scores, and mental health subscale scores. women from china were enrolled significantly later in their pregnancies than women in the united states. the average difference in gestational age across the matched sets was 2.66 weeks. 100 (56) 98.2 (54) 76.8 (43) CvG: p = 1.0 (NS) CvU: p =.10 (NS) Highest level of education P.001 - High School graduate or less 30.3 (17) 25.9 (14) 7.2(4) - Some College to College Graduate 58.9 (33) 74.1 (40) 42.8 (24) - Some Graduate School/Professional School to Completed Graduate Degree 9.0 (5) 44.6 (25) Works \"currently being treated\" is a subset of the number who have \"ever been treated\" all of the women in the Ghanaian sample were married, as were a majority from the China sample (98.2%), and in the united states, a smaller yet significant percentage of the women. the LOT-R optimism subscale and the LOT-R pessimism subscale indicate significant differences across country samples as well. the LOT-R optimism subscale and the LOT-R pessimism subscale indicate significant differences across country samples as well.

LOT-R scores were positively correlated with SF-12 mental health summary scores (p =.001), vitality subscale scores (p =.041) and mental health subscale scores (p.001) the LOT-R optimism subscale was significantly associated with the same scales (MCS, p =.018; VT, p.001; MH, p =.001), and the general health subscale (GH, p =.002). pessimism is consistent with research that suggests optimism may not be mutually exclusive constructs. correlates of optimism/pessimism included country of origin, educational attainment, working for money, number of previous deliveries, and having ever seen a healthcare provider for emotional issues. women were more likely to have had a previous pregnancy that did not result in a delivery. in china, women were more likely to have had a previous pregnancy that did not result in a delivery. previous research indicates more than half of women in china have had at least one abortion. LOT-R measures what is referred to as dispositional (trait) optimism/pessimism. LOT-R measures what is referred to as dispositional (trait) optimism/pessimism. despite reporting the easiest pregnancies of the three groups of women, Chinese women in our sample reported the lowest levels of optimism. another limitation is the uncertainty surrounding the comparability of the constructs of optimism/pessimism across cultures. in the west, optimism is defined as the expectation that good things will happen to you in the future. data were colleted verbally in Ghana, whereas data were collected via self-reported surveys in the united states and the u.s. we do not believe this difference significantly impacted the outcome variables in question. /study described was supported by grant number T37 MD001425-08 from the National Center of Minority Health & Health Disparities, National Institutes of Health. it was also supported by Global REACH, the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Michigan Medical School and the Department of Maternal/Fetal Medicine at Peking University First Hospital."}
