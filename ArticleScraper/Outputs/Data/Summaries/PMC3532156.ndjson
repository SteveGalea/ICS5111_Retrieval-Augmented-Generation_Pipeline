{"summary": "tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the type member of tobamovirus genus, is a prevalent plant pathogen all over the world. it has the widest host range of over 885 plant species in 65 families. in certain fields 90\u2013100% of the plants show mosic or leaf necrosis by harvesting time. this plant virus has the name \u201cplant cancer\u201d and is difficult to control. chemical structures of compounds 1\u201324, Ribavirin, Ningnanmycin, Cryptopleuridine and (R)-Antofine offer advantages in that they can sometimes be specific to a target species. another benefit is their ability to decompose rapidly, thereby reducing their risk to the environment. phenanthroquinolizidine and phenanthroindolizidine alkaloids 1\u201324 were prepared and systematically evaluated for their antiviral activity against TMV. phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 10\u201317 were synthesized by using a synthetic approach involving coupling of the phenanthrene ring with 2-bromopyridine through a nucleophilic substitution reaction and subsequent reduction of the resulting pyridyl ketone as key steps. the hydrogenation of 26f was carried out at several different conditions. treatment of compound 26f with PtO2 in the solution of acetic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 41) at 50 atm gave the carbonyl group reduced intermediate 29 in 53% yield. phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloids 16 and 17 were designed and synthesized. tic acid and trifluoroacetic acid (v/v 51) at 10 atm gave 38 in 82% yield. treatment of ketone 35 with Pd/C as the catalyst in reluxing acetic acid at 1 atm gave the key intermediate 38 in 59% yield. treatment of pyridine 37 with cyclopropylmethyl bromide obtained 41, which deprotected phenanthroquinuolizidine alkaloid 16 in 69% yield. olizidine alkaloids showed higher antiviral activity than Ribavirin. cryptopleurine (1) and alkaloid 16 showed significantly higher antiviral activity than (R)-antofine. cryptopleurine (1) and alkaloid 16 exhibited significantly higher antiviral activity than (R)-antofine. cryptopleurine (1) and alkaloid 16 exhibited significantly higher antiviral activity. the removal of methoxyl at 7-position of the phenanthrene moiety is beneficial for mataining excellent antiviral activity. alkaloid 7 showed significantly higher activity than alkaloid 7. removal of 6-O methyl increased the antiviral activity. cyclopropyl methyl significantly decreased the antiviral activity. replacement of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with methylenedioxyl is tolerant. but replacement of 2,3-dimethoxyl or 6,7-dimethoxyl with ethylenedioxyl significantly increased the anti-TMV activity. in vitro and in vivo anti-TMV activity of chiral phenanthroquinolizidine alkaloids 2, 3, 5, 6, 8 and 9.
