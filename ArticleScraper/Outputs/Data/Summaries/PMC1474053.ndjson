{"summary": "negative strand contains a 5\u2032-poly(A) tract, which is synthesized using the poly(A) of the positive viral RNA as a template. this poly(U) serves as a template for the synthesis of the poly(A) of progeny RNA. a shorter poly(U) is synthesized on a longer poly(A) template. poly(rC) binding proteins PCBP1 and PCBP2 (6\u20138) to form a ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complex. the latter requires genome circularization mediated by an interaction between this RNP and the host poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) bound to 3\u2032-poly(A) (10,11) another cis-acting replicative element (cre or oriI) is represented by an imperfect stem\u2013loop located within the coding region of the enter synthesis of a RNA strand on the viral RNA template is believed to result in the formation of a genome-length double-stranded \u2018replicative form\u2019 (RF) RNA. a number of important issues pertaining to picornavirus genome replication remain contradictory or unsolved. poly(A) length is controlled by the oriR. removal of poly(A) from transfected viral RNA resulted in regeneration of poly(A)-containing 3\u2032-tails. results provide new insights into mechanisms and evolution of genome replication of positive-strand RNA viruses. gel-purified products were inserted into the pGEM-T Easy vector. clones were cloned into pRibCB3/T7-Stu (7310) digested with StuI and SalI. sequence analysis verified the correct clones. 3\u2032NCR-N70/A-poly(A) and p53CB3/T7-3\u2032NCR-N70/A-poly(A)+AAUAAA were amplification primers.

X domain can be stacked to the tertiary \u2018kissing\u2019 interaction to form a coaxial helical element, which is connected by single-stranded nucleotide stretches to a second coaxial helical domain Z-Y. the entire 3\u2032NCR sequence of a virus recovered after transfection with the KD1 mutant was represented by mutants with spontaneous deletion of both X and Y domains. mutants exhibited a marked deficiency in the virus reproduction (Figure 4A) and a small plaque-phenotype (Figure 4B) the mutations were also accompanied with a severe reduction in poly(A) length, to 45 nt (X), 30 nt (Y) and 20 nt (3\u2032NCR) efficient viral RNA replication requires an oriR with a sufficiently stable kissing interaction, although the sequence of the K-domain could vary. a poly(A) of 20 nt is sufficient for the efficient replication of poliovirus (39), whereas shorter poly(A) resulted in a dead or highly debilitated virus (2,10,31,40). the poly(A) construct contained 3\u2032-terminal TCGA derived from a SalI site at the linearization locus. transcripts of all these constructs exhibited a CPE delayed for 2\u20133 days. the RNA of the recovered poly(A) mutant corresponded to its DNA construct, whereas the poly(G) moiety of the G23 mutant lost 21\u201322 G-residues and the C9G moiety of the respective mutant was replaced by the size was measured on the second day p.i. except for plaques with a diameter 0.5 mm, which became discernible only on the third day p.i. the equivalent ribozyme-containing transcript with a genuine 5\u2032-end, 3\u2032NCR-poly(A) was viable, though exhibited a delayed CPE of 5 days after transfection. a ribozyme-lacking N70-poly(A) mutant was dead. however, insertion of an AAUAAA-containing oligonucleotide into the randomized N70 sequence produced a viable virus with 3\u2032-poly(A) preceded by relatively long poly(U) tracts and an oligo(A) stretch interspersed with several single U residues, again generating AAUAAA polyadenylation-like signals. 3\u2032NCR-N70/B RNA exhibited several differences compared with the original recovered viruses. modifications included deletions of 13 or 29 nt-long heteropolymeric segments. the virus recovered after transfection with 3\u2032NCR-N111-poly(A) and its four clonal derivatives exhibited, upon passaging, in addition to lengthening of internal poly(A) cis-element in the 3\u2032NCR of genomic RNA significantly reduces the poly(A) size and decreases the efficiency of () RNA synthesis but does not affect the poly(U) length. effective genome replication requires the presence of a poly(A) of at least 20 nt but its complete removal did not kill the virus because of the poly(A) capacity to regenerate. nascent oriR binds and activates an enzyme with the adenylate transferase activity of viral or host origin, which accomplishes poly(A) elongation. nascent viral RNAs have only 20 nt-long poly(A). the oriR-dependent poly(A) additions to the 'immature' viral RNA may be post-replicative (i.e. occurring after completion of nascent positive strand transcription) or post-translational (i.e. accomplished by the nascent RdRP molecule or TNT-like enzyme) the oriR itself controls the poly(A) length just by its stabilization. oriR modifications do not permit formation of functional initiation complex, resulting in a dead genome. the fixed location of this site could be explained by unavailability of other loci on the poly(A) or a higher-order RNA structure (54). the viral RdRP and the nascent poly(U) jump to the heteropolymer/homopolymer boundary to continue the elongation. however, most poly(A)-lacking constructs proved to be (quasi)-infectious, generating genomes with newly-acquired AU-rich tails terminating with poly(A) a possible contribution of the AAUAAA signals to the appearance of oligo(A) stretches in the aberrant 3\u2032-tails of the viral RNA is supported by the finding that the addition of this signal restored viability of 3\u2032NCR-N70-poly(A) RNA. the origin of the poly(U) blocks in the (+) RNA molecules is enigmatic. if tailing occurs at the level of viral RNA, the 3\u2032-poly(A) may be added by snap-back synthesis on poly(U) blocks. if tailing occurs at the level of viral RNA, the 3\u2032-poly(A) may be added by snap-back synthesis on poly(U) blocks. nascent oriR-lacking mutants could be regarded as relying on ancient replicative tools. regeneration of poly(A) after its complete deletion suggests existence of unspecific mechanisms, which may'revive' nearly dead viruses. cases of increase in the length of internal oligo(A) in poliovirus (23,46) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (47) RNAs support the possibility of reiterative copying during picornavirus RNA replication. additional polyadenylation of viral RNA is replication-coupled. nascent viral RNAs have only 20 nt-long poly(A) further polyadenylation is accomplished by a TNT-like enzyme activated by binding to oriR. this job may be performed by a host poly(A) polymerase (50) or the terminal adenylate transferase activity may be an intrinsic property of the viral RdRP. the poly(A) tail is more accessible for the initiation complex. it could be more harmful for the virus to possess certain oriR modifications than to lack this element altogether. this may indicate that some oriR modifications do not permit formation of a functional initiation complex. VPg-dependent synthesis of enterovirus () strands starts at or near the 3\u2032-end of the poly(A) template but after synthesizing 20 nt-long poly(U) the viral RdRP together with the nascent poly(U) jumps to the heteropolymer/homopolymer boundary to continue the elongation. however, most poly(A)-lacking constructs proved to be (quasi)-infectious recombination is supported by the observed inclusion of apparently host-derived sequences identical to a part of the human heterogeneous nuclear RNP U mRNA (residues 2408\u20132437) into the acquired 3\u2032-tails upon passages. passages of viruses with altered 3\u2032-tails resulted in further modifications, e.g. elongation of internal poly(U) and poly(A) stretches. low-fitness viruses thereby generated are the origin of the poly(U) blocks in the (+) RNA molecules is enigmatic. it cannot be excluded that they are also due to a TNT-like activity. if tailing occurs at the level of viral RNA, the 3\u2032-poly(A) may be added by snap-back synthesis. oriR belongs to a class of cis-elements, which are important but not essential. regeneration of poly(A) after its complete deletion suggests the existence of unspecific mechanisms, which may \u2018revive\u2019 nearly dead viruses."}
