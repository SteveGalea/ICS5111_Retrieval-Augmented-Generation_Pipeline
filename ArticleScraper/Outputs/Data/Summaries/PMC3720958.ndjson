{"summary": "Cryptococcus is responsible for approximately one-third of all AIDS related deaths and a more prevalent cause of HIV-related mortality in sub-Saharan Africa than tuberculosis. in other developing countries infections as a result of Cryptococcus are second only to tuberculosis and frequently co-occur together. frquent isolation of Cryptococcus from plants and mating in association with plants, trees, soil, and avian guano suggest the importance of the environmental niche for both the development of infectious propagules. humans are frequently exposed to its airborne infectious propagules through inhalation [25], [26]. the inoculation route, high dosages of cells used, and initial fluid solution could alter initial immune response and downstream sequela [34]\u2013[38] spores may be administered within a suspension, compared to crude soil exposure. only 20% of mice exposed to aerosolized Cryptococcus basidiospores succumbed to infection. the inoculum used, method of aerosolization, duration of exposure, host genotype, and strain of Cryptococcus were likely due to differences in the inoculum used, method of aerosolization, duration of exposure, and virulence of divergent mating types and genotypes. a well validated inhalation model has considerable potential to facilitate novel insights into the primary exposure route of Cryptococcus in humans. C. neoformans var. neoformans JEC21; C. neoformans var. grubii H99, KN99a, YSB119, and KN99a NEO1; and C. gattii EJB18. we aimed to obtain a calculated dose presented of greater than 100 cells/mouse to maximize dose delivered and retention within the lungs. eleven trial experiments were performed, eight without mice, and three utilizing mice. cells were passaged twice in 250 mL flasks containing 25 mL of YPD broth. cell density was determined by hemacytometer and 20 mL of a 1108 cell/mL suspension were prepared for each strain. the colonies were scraped from the plates, washed, suspended in 5 mL water, counted with a hemacytometer, and diluted to the standard cell density. the suspension was centrifuged, washed, re-suspended in 5 mL water, counted with a hemacytometer, and diluted to the standardized inoculum cell density. cryptococcus aerosols inside the Madison Chamber were sampled using an APS and bioSampler. the start and stop operation of APS and bioSampler was controlled by AeroMP. Viable aerosol concentration (Ca) was calculated as where Csam is concentration in BioSampler, VBS is the volume of liquid in the BioSampler after aerosol exposure, td is aerosol exposure time duration, and QBS is bioSampler air flow rate. a total of 15 mL sterile filtered water was used in the BioSampler to capture aerosolized samples. eight mice were exposed to aerosolized C. gattii strain EJB18. mice were humanely euthanized, lung, spleen, and brain tissues were sterilely collected in a BLSII hood. four mice per group were humanly euthanized and lung, spleen, and brain tissues were sterilely collected at one hour and three weeks post exposure. we used previously constructed C. neoformans var. grubii strains YSB119 (a) and KN99a (a) to determine if spores survived nebulization, aerosolized, or were retained within the lungs better than yeast cells. Cryptococcus Strains, Growth Media, and Inoculum Preparation Experiments were performed with C. neoformans var. neoformans JEC21; C. neoformans var. grubii H99, KN99a, YSB119, and KN99a NEO1; and C. gattii EJB18. in total, eleven trial experiments were performed, eight without mice, and three utilizing mice. cells were passaged twice in 250 mL flasks containing 25 mL of YPD broth. cell density was determined by hemacytometer and 20 mL of a 1108 cell/mL suspension were prepared for each strain. the colonies were scraped from the plates, washed, suspended in 5 mL water, counted with a hemacytometer, and diluted to the standard cell density. the suspension was centrifuged, washed, re-suspended in 5 mL water, counted with a hemacytometer, and diluted to the standard cell density. cryptococcus aerosols inside the Madison Chamber were sampled using an aerodynamic particle sizer. the start and stop operation of APS and BioSampler was controlled by AeroMP. Viable aerosol concentration (Ca) was calculated as where Csam is concentration in BioSampler, VBS is the volume of liquid in the BioSampler after aerosol exposure, td is aerosol exposure time duration, and QBS is bioSampler air flow rate. spray factor was calculated as where Ca is viable aerosol concentration and CS is nebulizer sample concentration. eight mice were exposed to aerosolized C. gattii strain EJB18. mice were humanely euthanized, and lung, spleen, and brain tissues were sterilely collected in a BLSII hood. four mice per group were humanly euthanized and lung, spleen, and brain tissues were sterilely collected at one hour and three weeks post exposure. we used previously constructed C. neoformans var. grubii strains YSB119 (a) and KN99a (a) to determine if spores survived nebulization, aerosolized, or were retained within the lungs better than yeast cells. increased spray factor was observed for cells of C. neoformans var. grubii (H99) and C. gattii (EJB18) grown on Arabidopsis leaf (p = 0.003) and V8 agar (p = 0.008) in comparison to YPD broth-grown cells at 70% and 95% relative humidity (RH) trend was also observed in C. neoformans var. grubii (H99) and C. gattii (EJB18) cells. growth on agar increases spray factor and viable aerosols for Cryptococcus. open circles and squares represent C. neoformans var. grubii (H99) and open circles and squares represent C. gattii EJB18. increased bioSampler concentrations were obtained with increasing humidity and increasing duration of exposure. oformans var. grubii H99, KN99a, or the mated mixture with spores were aerosolized in individual exposures. the average dose retained for the mated mixtures with spores was 1.4 (KN99a) and 2.4 (H99) higher than yeast alone, this difference was not statistically significant. NAT- and NEO- resistant colonies represented less than 0.001% of the cells obtained pre- and post-nebulization. we also noticed a large disparity between total CFUs on YPD agar and total CFUs of NEO-resistant cells. after 3\u20134 weeks incubation we observed a loss of NEOR cells in the KN99a NEO1 strain incubated alone or in combination with YSB119. after growth on V8 only 3 no significant differences in CFUs were observed between H99 (MAT), KN99a, or mated mixtures (with spores) at any 1 or 25 days post exposure. the observed MMAD, CMAD, and GSD for C. neoformans var. grubii. MMAD of C. gattii ranged from 1.0 m to 4 m, CMAD 0.67 to 0.90, and GSD ranged from 1.2 to 2.95. the observed MMAD was most consistent at 95% humidity. a higher concentration and mass of particles less than 5 m were observed. the size of aerosolized C. neoformans var. grubii particles was stable during 20 minutes of exposure at 45%, 70% and 95% humidity. the coefficient of variance of MMAD was 3.12% (45% RH), 3.54% (70% RH), and 3.83% (95% RH). the concentration of particles generated was more consistent at 70% and 95% RH than with 45% RH. growth on agar resulted in significantly higher values for viable aerosols than the broth-grown cells. a significant positive correlation between RH and spray factor was observed for C. neoformans var. grubii. log aerosol concentration plotted against relative humidity for broth-grown (B) C. neoformans var. grubii H99 (p = 0.0005, R2 = 0.802) and (C) C. gattii EJB18 (p = 0.06, R2 = 0.534) only 50% (EJB18, YPD-dried) of mice exposed to aerosolized C. gattii at 70% RH for 20 minutes retained viable C. gattii one hour post exposure. 100% of mice retain viable C. neoformans var. grubii cells within the lungs. use as the yeast only control for the mated mixtures containing yeast and spores was 1.7 higher than yeast alone (YSB119 and KN99a NEO1) but this difference was not statistically significant. after 3\u20134 weeks incubation we observed a loss of NEOR cells in the KN99a NEO1 strain incubated alone or in combination with YSB119. no Cryptococcus colonization was obtained from brain or spleen tissues 1 hour post exposure. no significant differences in CFUs were observed between H99 (MAT), KN99a, or mated mixtures (with spores) at any 1 or 25 days post exposure. oformans var. neoformans, C. neoformans var. grubii, and C. gattii ranged from 1.0 m\u20134.0 m. the MMAD indicates that the particle size was consistently in the respirable range of less than 5 m except for trial 6 in which the particle sizes ranged from 9.7 m to 17.2 m. the size of aerosolized C. neoformans var. grubii particles was stable during 20 minutes of exposure at 45%, 70% and 95% humidity. the coefficient of variance of MMAD was 3.12% (45% RH), 3.54% (70% RH), and 3.83% (95% RH). preliminary trials were performed to confirm viability of Cryptococcus cells post-nebulization. initial inoculum density was maximized to 1108 cells/mL in a 20 mL volume. yeast cells were larger (up to 10 m) than typical aerosolized pathogens. trial #6, MMAD ranged from 9 m to 17 m. the unusual MMAD observed may be the result of inefficient desiccation of yeast cells prior to re-suspension. elongated yeast and spore morphology of C. gattii contrast to the more consistent and round cell morphology of C. neoformans [70] in an attempt to maximize the dose presented, we grew Cryptococcus cells under different laboratory conditions that would more closely mimic conditions in nature. cells were grown in YPD broth and subjected to natural desiccation overnight or grown on Arabidopsis agar. humidity has been implicated to be a key factor in the viability and transmission of influenza (virus) and Francisella tularensis (bacteria) [77]\u2013[79]. increased environmental isolation of Cryptococcus gattii has been associated with the flowering of Eucalyptus in Australia and during dry, hot summers in Vancouver, BC and the northwestern USA. our bioSampler densities were 103 cells/mL to 105 cells/mL. this is similar to the observed \u201cviable cells received\u201d reported. 50% of mice exposed to the YPD-dried preparation had quantifiable dose retained in their lungs. our aim was to obtain the viable number of Cryptococcus cells that reached the lungs. previous studies have indicated that macrophages can quickly initiate killing within two hours. significant differences in killing of Cryptococcus can be observed within one to four hours of in vitro incubation with macrophages and neutrophils. spleen and brain tissues were not colonized by Cryptococcus at one hour post exposure. 100% of mice displayed patterns of weight loss and significant increase of tissue burdens. one mouse expired prior to the 25-day time-point, consistent with disease development. MMAD of all trials appeared relatively consistent between 1.5 m and 4.0 m except for trial #6. no significant differences were observed in the MMAD of C. neoformans var. grubii and C. gattii (EJB18) trial #2 (A) EJB18 30 min.; (B) EJB18 45 min.; (C) EJB18 60 min. YPD-broth grown and RH undetermined. agar grown cells display more consistent particle size, mass, and density. 6 aerodynamic particle characteristics of C. neoformans var. grubii yeast cells and mated mixtures containing spores are similar. cells were aerosolized at 95% relative humidity. MMAD remains consistent when aerosolized at different relative humidity."}
