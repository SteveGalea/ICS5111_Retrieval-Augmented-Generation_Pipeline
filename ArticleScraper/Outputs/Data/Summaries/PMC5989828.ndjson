{"summary": "fluorescence imaging is one of the most powerful techniques to observe biomolecules in real-time with high spatial and temporal resolution. a diverse set of genetically encodable fluorescent biosensors have been designed to probe dynamic cellular events. these sensors have enabled researchers to track various components of intracellular signaling networks in real time within the native cellular environment. methods based on non-covalent interaction between a protein tag and a fluorogenic dye have emerged16, 17. non-covalent labeling can be very fast since no covalent bond has to be created. systems based on reversible non-covalent binding could provide an additional degree of control as fluorescence could also be switched off by washing away the fluorogenic ligand. fusion proteins19 is a fluorogenic tagging approach that uses molecular recognition to directly activate the fluorescence of otherwise nonfluorescent small-molecule dyes. selected FAPs bind TO and MG with nanomolar affinity and increase their respective fluorescence by as much as thousands of fold. fluorescence visualization can be spatially controlled by the appropriate choice of the membrane permeable and impermeable fluorogens. variations of the fluorogens have been shown to produce a variety of distinct spectral and sensing properties for a given FAP. the existence of FAPs comprised of only VH or VL domains that activate MG have already been demonstrated by Szent-Gyorgyi et al.18. scFvs-based FAPs have been reconstructed and researched to discover more desirable FAPs with appropriate and superior properties. fluorogens are derivatives of MG or TO, FAPs comprised of hypervariable heavy (H) and light (L) chains joined by a flexible linker. all information is taken from Refs. 18, 21. the discovery of the FAPs FAP technology was first introduced in 2008 by Szent-Gyorgyi et al.18 by using single-chain antibodies as genetically encodable FAP. eight unique FAPs were isolated from the library, among which six proteins specifically activate modified MG. FAPs represent a new class of fluorogen-based reporters. they provide a fluorescent tool for imaging fusion protein's location and abundance in time and space. fluorogen binding to most FAPs occurs within seconds of addition. the interactions between the DIR sulfonate and M8VL show the two orientations of the bound DIR in the crystal structure (green and yellow), and the A (light blue) and B (blue) VL chains. Adapted with permission from Ref. 21. 1.2. the dL5** FAP is a synthetic dimer of a light chain with a disulfide forming pair of cysteines in each monomer. this type of FAP was normally bright but considerably less photostable across multiple compartments, which has proven useful for super-resolution imaging22. the fluorogens of the MG, TO and DIR are classic FAP fluorogens. the fluorogens exhibit strong absorbance maxima at 607 nm (MG), 504 nm (TO) and 610 nm (DIR), but exhibit extremely low levels of fluorescence. fluorogens used for the development of FAP labeling methods. the maximum emission wavelengths of fluorogens bound to their cognate FAPs are given. fluorogens of FAPs based on MG, TO or DIR were explored for tracking cellular proteins and other signaling molecules. fluorogen MG exhibited small Stokes shifts ( = 20 nm), great efforts have been dedicated to increase the wavelength length difference between the excitation and emission. three series of novel 3-indole-Malachite Green-based FAP fluorogens35 have been developed. they have the potential to be an alternative to FRET-based MG fluorogens with large pseudo-Stokes shifts. two series of NIR FAP fluoromodules have been developed by modification of TO26 or MG38 via conjugating methine groups. MG modified fluorogens have been successfully used for the detection of protein\u2013protein interactions in vivo. fluorogen MG exhibited small Stokes shifts ( = 20 nm), great efforts have been dedicated to increase the wavelength length difference between the excitation and emission. three series of F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based MG fluorogens with large pseudo-Stokes shifts have been developed. the important features of this class of FAP fluorogens are the efficient internal charge transfer resulting in significant fluorescence enhancements. AP fluoromodules have been developed by modification of TO26 or MG38 via conjugating methine groups. MG modified fluorogens have been successfully used in selectively visualization of protein location, internalization and trafficking in mammalian and yeast cells. Bruchez's group28 established a three-color labeling approach. the same group established a three-color labeling approach. it allows excitation-dependent visualization of extracellular, intracellular, and total protein pools. we and Br\u00f6nstrup group first applied MG/FAP to study translocation efficiencies of molecular scaffolds designed to transport cargos in bacteria. this provided a general method for investigating the translocation capability of compounds across the membrane of bacterial cells. super resolution imaging enables researchers to visualize and investigate biological processes at individual molecule level inside living cells. functional biomaterials and biosensors FAPs proved to be beneficial for the design of functional biomaterials and biosensors. dL5 FAP and AEAEAKAK, an amphiphilic peptide, are combined to form a solid-phase fluorescence detection platform. Bruchez et al.58 described the chemical structure of the FRET-based dye. a derivative of TO is linked to the pH-dependent Cy5 analogue. a derivative of TO is linked to the pH-dependent Cy5 analogue. affiFAP was expected to minimize any undesired non-specific probe fluorescence. they extended the application of affiFAP to in vivo imaging of a xenografted human EGFR-enriched tumor model in mice. it is promising to be used in clinical settings to molecularly define tumor margins. membrane permeable fluorogen MG-ester, Bruchez et al.25 presented a new labeling technology for cytoplasmic compartments, which is no-wash, far-red, highly fluorogenic, photostable, and nonphototoxic. later, a two-color, Green-Inside Red-Outside (GIRO) labeling approach that generates distinct signals from surface and internal proteins in live cells for simultaneous detection is also demonstrated by Bruchez's group28. fluorescence can be limited to proteins that are or have recently been resident on the surface membrane in living cells. the hybrid platform allows drug discovery for trafficking receptors such as GPCRs. they later expanded the hybrid system to a new type of biosensor. the ability to label a subset of proteins independently of the expression level also enabled to track individual receptors in living cells. functional biomaterials and biosensors FAPs proved to be beneficial for the design of functional biomaterials and biosensors. a targetable near-infrared photosensitizer (TAP)-FAP has been described by Bruchez et al.58. it allows researchers to study protein inactivation, targeted-damage introduction and cellular ablation with unprecedented precision. tumor-targeting probe, affiFAP, containing a protein that specifically binds EGFR (affibody) and dL5** FAP. affiFAPs were pre-targeted with fluorogens prior to injection. the latter approach was expected to minimize any undesired non-specific probe fluorescence and to demonstrate a possible no-wash platform for surgical guidance. fluorogens can be designed to display improved spectral properties, brightness, and photostability. through random mutagenesis and directed evolution, FAPs can be selected to accommodate a large repertoire of fluorogens."}
