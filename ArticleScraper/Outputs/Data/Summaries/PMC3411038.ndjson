{"summary": "cathelicidins and defensins share a conserved prodomain called \u201ccathelin\u201d (1). cathelicidins are cathelicidins with many structural similarities to -defensins. a stop codon limits initial defensin domain peptides to 12 residues. the transcripts contain an additional stop codon in the signal sequence domain. the mutation aborts translation of the -defensin peptide precursors. the human genome contains >30 different -defensin genes, and mice have even more (6). some other human and rodent -defensins are expressed in localized regions of the male genitourinary tract. es contain a 19-residue signal sequence, a 45-residue anionic propiece, and a 30-residue defensin domain. the first and last residues are cysteines that are joined by a disulfide bond, a common mode of cyclization. one more evolutionary event led to the backbone cyclic peptides described below. two such nonapeptides were converted into a -defensin by two peptide bonds that spliced them in a head-to-tail manner. the different nonapeptides in a -defensin can be identical (AA, BB, and CC) or different (AB, AC, and BC) cDNA cloning studies were done to identify the rhesus PG-like peptide. six rhesus -defensin-like genes were cloned, including three whose C-terminal defensin domains would have ended after only 12 residues had been translated. antimicrobial properties Retrocyclin-1 (RC-1) and RTD-1 (21) killed E. coli in the same way as human -defensins (22), by permeabilizing its membranes. RTD-1 killed E. coli ML-35 in medium with physiological concentrations of NaCl, Ca2+ or Mg2+ that inhibited -defensins. listriolysin O permits ingested Listeria to escape confinement and destruction in the phagocytic vacuoles of macrophages. the pathogenic role of anthrolysin is less certain, but similar events may take place with B. anthracis. RC-1 did inhibit the formation of proviral DNA, indicating that it acted early, most likely by preventing viral entry (29). RC-1 was not effective against HIV-2 and simian immunodeficiency virus type 1 related retroviruses that infect blood mononuclear cells. RC-1 completely blocked fusion mediated by HIV-1 envelopes that used CXCR4 or CCR5. fusion assays were done using susceptible target cells and effector cells. RC-1 inhibited fusion without impairing the lateral mobility of CD4. RC-1 neutralized influenza A virus by impairing hemagglutinin-mediated viral entry. RC-2 inhibited hemagglutinin-mediated membrane fusion. RC-2 also inhibited fusion mediated by Sindbis virus and baculovirus. fensins were tested in vitro to determine their ability to prevent infection of cervical epithelial cells by HSV-1 and HSV-2 (38). RC-2 bound HSV-2 glycoprotein B with a Kd of 13.3 nm and did not bind deglycosylated HSV-2 glycoprotein B with a Kd of 13.3 nm. the orientation (tilt and rotation) of RC-2 molecules within model membranes has also been studied by advanced solid-state NMR techniques (42). RC-2 selectively disrupts the orientational order of anionic membranes while leaving intact zwitterionic membranes (which are more representative of mammalian membranes) only intact DEFT genes were found in several Old World monkeys and in the siamang (Hylobates syndactylus), a lesser ape. -defensins may be more potent than -defensins, but their mode of production is less efficient than the standard assembly line production of -defensins. a main focus has been developing -defensins as topical microbicides to prevent sexually transmitted HIV-1 and HSV infections."}
