{"summary": "influenza infection often worsens preexisting medical conditions [5,6,7] despite increasing vaccination rates, influenza-related hospitalizations are increasing [8,10], and substantial drug resistance has developed to two of the four currently approved anti-viral drugs [11,12]. despite increasing vaccination rates, influenza-related hospitalizations are increasing [8,10], and substantial drug resistance has developed to two of the four currently approved anti-viral drugs. a four-fold increase in titer post-vaccination, or a HI titer of 1:40 is considered protective. laIV is administered as a nasal spray and contains the same three or four influenza virus strains as inactivated vaccines but on an attenuated vaccine backbone. vaccine strain selection occurs in the northern hemisphere, then manufacturers begin production, taking at least six months to produce the millions of vaccine doses required for the fall [27] there is some suggestion that LAIV may induce broader protection than TIV due to the diversity of the immune response consistent with inducing virus-neutralizing serum and mucosal antibodies, as well as broadly reactive T cell responses. Table 1 summarizes the benefits and concerns of each of the virus-vectored vaccines discussed here. Vectored Vaccine Benefits Concerns Adenovirus Stable, readily manipulated vector system Replicates in established vaccine cell lines Can be dried; no cold chain required Robust transgene expression Infects a broad range of cell types Extensive safety record and clinical trial data. poxvirus Vectors Stable, readily manipulated vector system Replicates in established vaccine cell lines Can be dried; no cold chain required Extensive safety record and clinical trial data Robust innate, cellular and humoral immune responses Preexisting immunity DNA genome raises concerns of integration Vesicular Stomatitis RNA genome. adenovirus vectors are attractive as vaccine vectors because their genome is very stable. replication-defective adenovirus vectors are immunostimulatory and effective adjuvants to the recombinant antigen being delivered. rAd5-HA expressing the HA was delivered to humans epicutaneously or intranasally and assayed for safety and immunogenicity. two clinical trials with rAd vectors have been successful, demonstrating safety and some level of efficacy. individuals were vaccinated with the Ad5 vaccine vector expressing HIV-1 gag, pol, and nef genes. the vaccine induced HIV-specific T cell responses; however, the study was stopped after interim analysis suggested the vaccine did not achieve efficacy. the umbra cast by clinical trials notes has affected interest for all adenovirus vaccines. non-human adenovirus vectors include those from non-human primates (NHP), dogs, sheep, pigs, cows, birds and others. these vectors can infect a variety of cell types, but are generally attenuated in humans avoiding concerns of preexisting immunity. low prevalence serotypes such as rAd5-H5 vaccines have also been shown to be efficacious. the wild type viruses are non-pathogenic and replication incompetent in humans. the recombinant AAV vector systems are even further attenuated. there is limited preexisting immunity, but availability of non-human strains eliminates these concerns. intramuscular and intranasal delivery of the AAVs was shown to protect against a number of influenza virus challenges in mice and ferrets. studies suggest that rAAV vectors are promising vaccine and immunoprophylaxis vectors. there is as yet limited safety data for use of rAAV as vaccines. a recombinant SIN virus was used as a vaccine vector to deliver a CD8+ T cell epitope only. the well-characterized NP epitope was transgenically expressed in the SIN system and shown to be immunogenic in mice. the replicon system targets antigen-presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues, priming rapid and robust immune responses. a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use. recently, a baculovirus-derived recombinant HA vaccine was approved for human use. the virus has a number of advantages as vaccine vectors. vesicular stomatitis virus controlled by the insect polyhedron promoter and the HA of A/Chicken/Hubei/327/2004 (H5N1) HPAIV controlled by a CMV promoter were used to generate the BV-G-HA. a separate study demonstrated efficacy using a bivalent pseudotyped baculovirus vector. baculovirus is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus that causes disease in poultry. there is little or no preexisting immunity to NDV in humans. there is no DNA phase in the virus lifecycle reducing concerns of integration events. rNDV was tested as a vaccine vector for HPAIV having varying efficacy against H5 and H7 influenza virus infections in poultry [88,89,90,91,92,93,94]. these vaccines have the added benefit of potentially providing protection against both the influenza virus and NDV infection. a reverse genetics system for PIV5 was first used to insert the HA gene from A/Udorn/307/72 (H3N2) into the PIV5 genome between the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene and the large (L) polymerase gene. a single intranasal immunization in a murine model of influenza infection was shown to induce neutralizing antibody responses and protect against lethal challenge. live PIV5 has been a component of veterinary vaccines for \u201ckennel cough\u201d for 30 years. there is no clinical safety data for use of PIV5 in humans. a study evaluating the efficacy of a PIV5-H3 vaccine in canines previously vaccinated against PIV5 (kennel cough) showed induction of robust anti-H3 serum antibody responses as well as high serum antibody levels to the PIV5 vaccine. this suggests preexisting immunity to the modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) strain was attenuated by passage 530 times in chick embryo fibroblasts cultures. new york vaccinia virus (NYVAC) was a plaque-purified clone of the Copenhagen vaccine strain rationally attenuated by deletion of 18 open reading frames. recombinant MVA vaccines expressing influenza antigens have been tested in clinical trials and shown to be safe and immunogenic in humans. vaccinia virus strain NYVAC is replication-restricted; however, it grows in chick embryo fibroblasts and vero cells. a vaccine expressing the HA from a/chicken/Indonesia/7/2003 (H5N1) was shown to induce potent neutralizing antibody responses and protect against challenge in swine. there is strong safety and efficacy data for use of NYVAC or MVA-vectored influenza vaccines. current influenza vaccination strategies rely upon regular immunization with vaccines matched to circulating strains. gen has the added benefit of providing protection against fowlpox infection. at least ten poxvirus-vectored vaccines have been licensed for veterinary use. the availability of these non-human poxvirus vectors with extensive animal safety and efficacy data may address issues with preexisting immunity. HA protein from a/WSN/1933 (H1N1) was shown to be immunogenic. one candidate vaccine had a truncated VSV G protein, while another was deficient in G protein expression. both vectors were found to be attenuated in mice, but maintained immunogenicity. safety concerns have led to the majority of adenovirus-based vaccine development to focus on replication-defective vectors. adenovirus 5 (rAd5) is the most-studied serotype, having been tested for gene delivery and anti-cancer agents. adenovirus vectors are attractive as vaccine vectors because their genome is very stable. rAd5-HA was delivered to humans epicutaneously or intranasally. the vaccine was well tolerated and induced seroconversion with the intranasal administration had a higher conversion rate. rAd5 as a vector has been negatively overshadowed by two clinical trial failures. adenoviruses expressing HA antigens from pandemic pH1N1 (pH1N1), H5 and H7 highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus (HPAIV) and H9 avian influenza viruses have been tested for efficacy in a number of animal models. the efficacy of non-HA antigens has led to their inclusion with HA-based vaccines to improve immunogenicity. low-prevalence serotypes such as adenovirus types 3, 7, 11, and 35 can evade anti-Ad5 immune responses while maintaining effective antigen delivery and immunogenicity. prime-boost strategies, using DNA or protein immunization in conjunction with an adenovirus vaccine booster immunization have also been explored as a means to avoid preexisting immunity. non-human primate isolates (AAVrh32.33) were used to express influenza NP. mice vaccinated with rAAV-HA + rAAV-NP + rAAV-M1 had the most robust protection. rAAV vectors are promising vaccine and immunoprophylaxis vectors. the replication defective vaccines or replicons do not encode viral structural proteins, having these portions replace with transgenic material. despite the partial viral genome, the RNAs are self-replicating and can express transgenes at very high levels. a replicon system expressing the HA from PR8 was shown to induce potent HA-specific immune response. the VEE targets antigen-presenting cells in the lymphatic tissues. the replicon systems can induce robust mucosal immune responses through intranasal or subcutaneous immunization [72,73,74], and subcutaneous immunization with virus-like replicon particles (VRP) expressing HA-induced antigen-specific systemic IgG and fecal IgA antibodies. the insect promoters are not effective for mammalian gene expression. baculovirus vaccine vectors have been tested as influenza vaccines. intranasal immunization with wild type AcNPV also resulted in protection from lethal challenge. a commercial baculovirus vector was incorporated into a commercial baculovirus vector controlled by the e1 promoter from white Spot syndrome Virus. the resulting recombinant virus was propagated in insect (Sf9) cells and inactivated as a particle vaccine. oral delivery of this encapsulated vaccine induced robust serum HI titers and mucosal IgA titers in mice. gene expression enables attenuation through rearrangement of the genome. pathogenicity of NDV is determined by features of the fusion protein. rNDV has also been explored as a vaccine vector for humans. parainfluenza virus type 5 is a paramyxovirus vaccine vector being explored for delivery of influenza and other infectious disease vaccine antigens. PIV5 has a stable RNA genome and no DNA phase in virus replication cycle reducing concerns of host genome integration. a single intranasal immunization in a murine challenge model of influenza infection was shown to induce neutralizing antibody responses and protect against a virus expressing homologous HA protein. a single intranasal immunization with PIV5-H5 induced robust serum and mucosal antibody responses. a single intranasal immunization induced robust CD8+ T cell responses and protected against lethal influenza virus challenge. IV5-H3 vaccine in canines previously vaccinated against PIV5 (kennel cough) showed induction of robust anti-H3 serum antibody responses as well as high serum antibody levels to the PIV5 vaccine. the termination of the smallpox virus vaccination program has resulted in a large population of poxvirus-nave individuals that provides the opportunity for the use of poxviruses. modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) was developed prior to smallpox eradication to reduce or prevent adverse effects of other smallpox vaccines. serial tissue culture passage of MVA resulted in loss of 15% of the genome, and established a growth restriction for avian cells. recombinant MVA expressing the HA and NP of influenza virus was shown to be effective against lethal influenza virus challenge. recombinant MVA vaccines expressing influenza antigens have been tested in clinical trials. results combined with data from other (non-influenza) clinical and pre-clinical studies support MVA as a leading viral-vectored candidate vaccine. current influenza vaccination strategies rely upon regular immunization with vaccines matched to circulating strains. this would likely limit the use and/or efficacy of poxvirus-vectored influenza virus vaccines for regular and seasonal use. recombinant MVA expressing the HA and NP of influenza virus was shown to be effective against lethal influenza virus challenge in a murine model. recombinant MVA expressing various antigens from seasonal, pandemic, equine, and HPAI viruses have been shown to be effective against lethal influenza virus challenge. VA vaccines expressing influenza antigens have been tested in clinical trials. these results combined with data from other clinical and pre-clinical studies support MVA as a leading viral-vectored candidate vaccine. NYVAC may have an advantage for use as an influenza vaccine vector. immunization with this vector induces weaker vaccine-specific immune responses compared to other poxvirus vaccines. there is a growing list of licensed poxvirus for veterinary use. there is a growing list of licensed poxvirus for veterinary use. oviridae genome has a 3'-to-5' gradient of gene expression. the latter delivery method enables induction of mucosal immunity. there is little evidence of VSV seropositivity in humans eliminating concerns of preexisting immunity. there is no human safety data for VSV-vectored vaccines. there is significant interest in developing universal influenza vaccines. NP and M2 proteins have been explored as universal vaccine antigens for decades. studies using a DNA-prime, rAd-boost strategies to vaccinate against the entire M2 protein have shown the antigen to be immunogenic and protective [50] antibodies to the M2 protein have been combined to induce broadly cross-reactive CD8+ T cell and antibody responses. the majority of these broadly cross-reactive antibodies recognize regions on the stalk of the HA protein. the concept of a \u201cone size fits all\u201d vaccine needs to be updated. there is also a need for revision of the current influenza virus vaccine strategies. a vectored influenza virus vaccine expresses the HA, NA and M proteins. influenza-vectored vaccines are relatively easy to manipulate and produce. the majority of human clinical trials assessing viral-vectored influenza vaccines use poxvirus and adenovirus vectors. the most promising approaches currently in development are those targeting conserved HA stalk region epitopes. edward et al."}
