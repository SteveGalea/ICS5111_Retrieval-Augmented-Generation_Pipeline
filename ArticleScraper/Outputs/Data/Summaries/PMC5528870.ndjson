{"summary": "a well-known complication with the estimation of severity of infection in \u2018real time\u2019 during an epidemic is the uncertainty about the final outcomes of some patients that remain in hospital at the time of analysis. the first objective of this study was to estimate the HFR of pandemic influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus infections (H1N1pdm09) during the first wave in Hong Kong in 2009. based on the cumulative cases and deaths and a fitted Weibull distribution (HFR3) for the hospitalization-to-death distribution. the three estimators are defined as follows: where HFRj(t) is the hospitalization fatality risk estimated on day t under method j; D(t) is the cumulative number of deaths on day t; C(t) is the cumulative number of hospitalized cases on day t; c(t) is the cumulative number of recovered cases on day the hospitalization-to-death distribution was unstable with fewer deaths. a fitted weibull distribution (HFR3) for the hospitalization-to-death distribution was used to maintain uncertainty in the hospitalization-to-death distribution. ibull cumulative distribution function of time from hospitalization to death based on data available at time t. HFR1 includes all hospitalized patients in the denominator, and may not be able to estimate the true HFR in the early stages of an epidemic. dm09 virus emerged in may 2009 and caused one major epidemic wave peaking in September\u2013October in that year. Mortality in hospitalized patients was 002% (1/4309), 129% (13/1005), 338% (24/710), and 461% (20/434) in the 20, 20\u201344, 45\u201364 and 65 years age groups. we applied the three different estimators to the H1N1pdm09 data in real time from august 2009 onwards. we found that the HFR estimate was relatively stable, and HFR estimates were similar for the three methods at different time points. estimates that accounted for censoring performed better than estimates without adjustment. this suggests that H1N1pdm09 infection was more likely to lead to fatal events in the elderly. we were able to obtain a timely estimate of HFR for adults in early September, before the peak of the first pandemic wave. this could be due to the smaller number of confirmed deaths in the elderly. click here to view supplementary material. click here to view supplementary material."}
