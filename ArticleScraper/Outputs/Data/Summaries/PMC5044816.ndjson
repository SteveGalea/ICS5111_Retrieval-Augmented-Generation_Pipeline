{"summary": "innate immunity is crucial for the host to defeat disease-causing pathogens. a number of studies have established the role of stimulator of ISG in limiting pathogen replication. FN genes (STING; also called MITA, TMEM173, MPYS, and ERIS) have shown that it is a key element in the innate immune response elicited by pathogenic nucleic acids. STING interacts with cytosolic single-stranded DNA/double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) sensors, including DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box polypeptide 41 (DDX41) (20), I Activated IRF3 and NF-B cooperate in the production of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines. many host factors and viral proteins have been implicated in modulating STING at the transcriptional level (40) or posttranslational level (32, 41\u201343), yet the regulatory mechanisms of STING have not been fully elucidated. pppRNA was purified using a Qiagen microRNA minikit (Qiagen) an RNA with the same sequence but lacking the 5\u2032ppp moiety was purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies Inc. (IDT) this RNA generated results identical to those obtained with 5\u2032pppRNA. the IFN-/ receptor chain (catalog number sc-35637; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), STAT1 (catalog number sc-44123; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), STAT1 (catalog number sc-44123; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), control siRNA (catalog number sc-37007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RELA (catalog number SI02663094; Qiagen), TNFRSF1A (catalog number cells were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 in a small volume of serum-free medium for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. infection with SeV was performed at 40 hemagglutination units (HAU) per ml. total RNA was reverse transcribed using high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription (RT) kits from Applied Biosystems according to manufacturer's instructions. CGATACCA-3\u2032, IFNB1 forward, 5\u2032-TTGTGCTTCTCTCCACTACAGC-3\u2032, IFIT1 forward, 5\u2032-CAACCAAGCAAATGAG-3\u2032, IRF7 forward, 5\u2032-CTTCGTGTTAACAAG-3\u2032, IRF7 forward, 5\u2032-CTTCGTGTTAACAAG-3\u2032, and TNFAIP3 reverse, 5\u2032-ACCCCATTCTCTCTAT-3\u2032. proteins were transferred for 1 anti-GFP signals detected by chemiluminescence using secondary antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Mandel Scientific) and an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit (Thermo Scientific) cells were analyzed on a BD Fortessa flow cytometer. 5\u2032pppRNA was administered on the day prior to infection (day 1) and on the day of infection (day 0) for determination of viral titers, organs were homogenized (20%, wt/vol) in DMEM. PC3 cells were grown in F-12K medium (Wisent) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% antibiotics (Wisent) human normal lung fibroblast MRC5 cells were immortalized human hepatocytes (IHHs) c-37007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), RELA (catalog number SI02663094; Qiagen), TNFRSF1A (catalog number SI00026418; Qiagen), and control siRNA (catalog number sc-37007; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) using Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Life technologies). Virus production, quantification, and infection. total RNA was reverse transcribed using high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kits from Applied Biosystems. RT-qPCR was performed on a 7500 Fast system using SYBR green (Roche Diagnostics) whole-cell lysates were resolved by 10% SDS-PAGE. proteins were transferred for 1 h at 100 V and 4\u00b0C to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in 5% (wt/vol) dried milk in phosphate-buffered saline. recombinant IFN- (Merck), IFN- (PBI Assay Science), IFN- (R&D systems), interleukin-1 (IL-1; R&D Systems), and TNF- (Invitrogen) were used at a final concentration of 1,000 IU/ml (IFNs), 25 g/ml (IL-1; R&D Systems), or 20 ng/ml (TNF-). 5\u2032pppRNA was administered intravenously via tail vein injection. organs were homogenized (20%, wt/vol) in DMEM. for determination of protein expression levels, organs were homogenized (20%, wt/vol) in lysis buffer. whole-cell extracts were prepared, resolved by SDS-PAGE. all immunoblots were of the same samples. levels of expression of STING, RIG-I, ISG56, A20, MAVS, STING. cells treated with siRNA directed against RIG-I (siRIG-I) were further induced upon RIG-I activation. a549 cells in which MAVS was stably knocked down with shRNA were generated. these cells failed to induce STING during SeV infection, whereas cells transfected with control shRNA were able to induce STING. 5\u2032pppRNA induces STING expression through secreted proteins. A549 cells were transfected with increasing amount of 5\u2032pppRNA. whole-cell extracts were prepared at different times after transfection. 5\u2032pppRNA stimulation of the RIG-I pathway activates both the IFN and NF-B pathways (44), which can be activated by secreted type I IFNs and TNF-, respectively. stimulation of fresh cells with supernatants for 24 h and 48 h still led to an increase in STING levels. A549 cells were transfected with 5\u2032pppRNA (10 ng/ml) and IFN- and TNF- levels in the supernatants were measured by ELISA. whole-cell extracts were analyzed by qPCR. levels of phosphorylated STAT1, STAT1, RIG-I, ISG56, A20, STING, and actin protein expression were analyzed by immunoblot analyses. IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- were also tested, either alone or in combination with TNF-, for their ability to induce STING expression. IL-1 failed to induce STING expression and did not exhibit any synergic effect with IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, or IFN-. a549 cells were transfected with siRNA directed against TNFR and/or IFN-/R. Knocking down of the receptors alone reduced the level of STING induction by 5\u2032pppRNA or TNF- and IFN- cotreatment compared to that achieved with control cells. STAT1/2 and RELA (p65) are crucial elements in the activation of IFN and NF-B signaling. AT1, pY701STAT1 (pSTAT1), STAT2, RELA, RIG-I, A20, and actin protein levels were analyzed by Western blotting. Statistical analysis was performed by Student's test (*, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001). a549 cells were transfected with TMEM173-specific siRNA (siSTING) or control siRNA (sictl), pretreated with 5\u2032pppRNA for 48 h and then challenged with HSV-1\u2013GFP for a 2-day period. similar results were found when we investigated the release of infectious HSV-1 particles via a standard plaque essay. cells were pretransfected with 5\u2032pppRNA for 48 h, followed by infection with HSV-1\u2013GFP (MOI, 0.1) or VSV-GFP (0.1MOI) for 2 days. the percentage of HSV-1- or VSV-infected cells was determined by flow cytometry analysis of GFP expression. in vivo-jetPEI transfection reagent led to upregulation of STING production in the lungs, liver, and spleen. MAVS-deficient mice also showed lower STING levels following 5\u2032pppRNA treatment. C57BL/6 mice and STING-deficient mice (STINGgt/gt mice) were inoculated with 5\u2032pppRNA 24 h before infection (day 1) and on the day of infection (day 0) with a lethal inoculum of luciferase-expressing HSV-1 (HSV-1\u2013Luc) mice were significantly more likely to survive than STINGgt/gt mice when subjected to lethal infection. 5\u2032pppRNA treatment reversed the weight loss of C57BL/6 mice. however, it did not in STINGgt/gt mice. the absence of STING did not affect the amount of 5\u2032pppRNA-induced IFN- released at an early time (6 h on day 1). IFN and TNF- synergistically mediate STING induction through transcription factors STAT1/STAT2 and NF-B. we measured an increase in STING expression at both the protein and mRNA levels in A549 cells. cells were transfected with control siRNA (sictl) or siRNA directed against RIG-I (siRIG-I) MRC5 cells were either transfected with 5\u2032pppRNA (10 ng/ml) for 24 h. whole-cell extracts were subjected to immunoblotting to examine levels of expression of STING, RIG-I, ISG56, phosphorylated STAT1 (p-STAT1), STAT1 and actin protein MAVS-knockdown cells failed to induce STING during SeV infection. cells transfected with control shRNA (shctl) were able to induce STING. qPCR analyses revealed a significant increase in STING levels at 24 h posttreatment. fresh A549 cells were transfected with 5\u2032pppRNA for 24 h. fresh A549 cells were transfected with control siRNA or RIG-I siRNA. whole-cell extracts were prepared and subjected to immunoblot analyses. 5\u2032pppRNA stimulation of the RIG-I pathway activates both the IFN and NF-B pathways. TNF- is known to synergize with IFN signaling to induce the expression of delayed type I IFN response genes via an autocrine loop. whole-cell extracts were analyzed by SDS-PAGE. levels of phosphorylated STAT1, STAT1, RIG-I, ISG56, A20, STING, and actin protein expression were analyzed by immunoblot analyses. IFN- alone or IFN- combined with TNF- was ineffective in inducing STING. IL-1, another potent activator of the NF-B signaling pathway, failed to induce STING expression and did not exhibit any synergic effect with IFN-, IFN-, or IFN-. none of these combinations resulted in effective STING induction. the depletion of STAT1, STAT2, and RELA significantly diminished the 5\u2032pppRNA induction of STING. STAT1/2 and RELA together mediate the IFN- and TNF-dependent induction of STING in response to 5\u2032pppRNA stimulation. cells were transfected with control siRNA, siRNA targeting IFN-/R, and/or siRNA targeting TNFR. mRNAs of several immune response genes were monitored by qPCR. the levels of mRNA for IFNB1, IRF7, TNFAIP3, DDX58, and IFIT1 were not initially affected by the absence of STING at early time points. TMEM173-specific siRNA (siSTING) or control siRNA (sictl) pretreated with 5\u2032pppRNA for 48 h, and then challenged with HSV-1\u2013GFP for a 2-day period. similar results were found when we investigated the release of infectious HSV-1 particles via a standard plaque essay. whole-cell extracts were subjected to immunoblotting to examine levels of expression of STING, HSV-1\u2013GFP, VSV-GFP, RIG-I, ISG56, and actin protein. data are means SDs from a representative experiment performed in triplicate. a set of experiments similar to those described above was carried out using VSV-GFP instead of HSV-1\u2013GFP. six-week-old mice, Mavs/ mice, or Ifnar/ mice were injected intravenously with 25 g of 5\u2032pppRNA in complex with in vivo-jetPEI. immunoblot analyses were performed to measure levels of STING, RIG-I, and actin protein expression in the indicated organs at 24 h posttreatment. mice were inoculated with 5\u2032pppRNA 24 h before infection (day 1) and on the day of infection (day 0) with a lethal inoculum of luciferase-expressing HSV-1 (HSV-1\u2013Luc) mice were significantly more likely to survive than STINGgt/gt mice when subjected to lethal infection (rats of survival, 66.7% versus 0%; P = 0.0044, log-rank tests) the absence of STING did not affect the amount of 5\u2032pppRNA-induced IFN- released at an early time (6 h on day 1). however, a significant decrease in the serum IFN- level was detected in both groups compared to that in C57BL/6 mice on day 1. the regulation of STING mediated by host factors or viral proteins has been investigated at the posttranslational level. TRIM56 and TRIM32 can positively mediate the K63-linked ubiquitination of STING, which leads to its dimerization and the subsequent recruitment of TBK1 (43, 54). phosphorylation of STING at Ser358 has also been reported following dsDNA stimulation (38) and SeV infection (31). cytokines were tested for their ability to induce STING expression. both type I IFNs (IFN- and IFN-) and the type II IFN (IFN-) were able to induce STING expression slightly when used alone. this was not the case for the type III IFN (IFN-) the combination of type I IFN and TNF- induces a powerful antiviral state distinct from the one induced by either cytokine alone (47). TNF- activates a feed-forward loop which sustains the expression of inflammatory genes and induces late interferon response genes (48). however, it has recently been shown that the STING 5\u2032 UTR contains STAT1 binding sites that are required for type I IFN induction of STING (58). 5\u2032pppRNA-treated mice showed increased STING levels in many organs. all STINGgt/gt mice inoculated with 5\u2032pppRNA succumbed to HSV-1 infection. however, there was a trend toward reduced viral infection. 5\u2032pppRNA's anti-HSV-1 activity was largely dependent on the presence of STING. we also unveil the key function of STING in the 5\u2032pppRNA-mediated restriction of HSV-1."}
