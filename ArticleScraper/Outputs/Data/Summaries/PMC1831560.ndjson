{"summary": "Cryptosporidium parvum is an intracellular protozoan parasite causing gastrointestinal disease and diarrhoea in a variety of animal species including cattle, sheep and man. the first report on bovine cryptosporidiosis was published in 1971, when C. parvum parasites were identified in the faeces from an 8-month-old heifer with chronic diarrhoea. the most prominent finding in an infected calf infected individual sheds microscopic cysts with the faeces and in calves intermittent cyst shedding can continue for several weeks. clinical picture is similar to that of cryptosporidiosis and comprises diarrhoea, depression, anorexia and mild fever. rotavirus has been the most commonly detected infectious agent in bovine neonatal enteritis. dairy calves aged 0\u201314 days harboured C. parvum oocysts in 3 out of 14 herds with calf diarrhoea problems. the prevalence and importance of giardiosis in the Swedish cattle population is not known. the birth date was calculated as the mean between the birth dates of the youngest and oldest calf in the pen. at arrival, the samples were immediately analysed for presence of C. parvum, rotavirus and coronavirus. an aliquot of each sample was stored at -70\u00b0C. diarrhoea was defined as faeces with a consistency that was looser than normal in calves. the samples were to be collected the second day after the onset of diarrhoea. the age of a calf was calculated as days between date of birth and date of arrival of sample to the laboratory. faecal samples from 146 diarrhoeic and 124 healthy calves were sent to the laboratory and analysed. of the 3081 heifer calves born in the study herds during 1998, 302 developed diarrhoea before 90 days of age. faecal samples were submitted from 48% of the diarrhoeic calves in the herds. C. parvum, G. intestinalis and rotavirus were found in calves between 7\u201384, 9\u201384 and 5\u201378 days old. these agents were found in the faecal samples throughout the year. the first large scale investigation of C. parvum and G. intestinalis infections in Swedish dairy calves. 8% of calves in the present study showed oocyst shedding, which was not restricted to scouring calves. this is consistent with a previous finding that rotavirus and C. parvum are the predominant agents causing neonatal diarrhoea. in the present study, C. parvum and rotavirus were found throughout the 90 days sampling period, except for the first neonatal days. asymptomatic adult cattle have been found to excrete C. parvum oocysts and have been implied to transmit the infection in cattle herds. an absence of association between season of the year and prevalence of the parasite was reported by [28] however, others have found seasonal variation in the prevalence of bovine C. parvum infection, maybe owing to climate factors and various managemental factors such as seasonal production of livestock."}
