{"summary": "the villi of jejunum and ileum become shorter after TGEV infection. the virus destroys the absorption function of intestinal epithelial cells. TGEV is one of the most important diseases threatening pork production worldwide. as Na+ absorption decreases, the osmotic pressure of the intestine increases abnormally. malabsorption diarrhea includes abnormal Na+ transporter activity in the brush border membrane of intestinal cells. a large amount of NHE3 promotes Na+ absorption in the intestinal epithelium via an electroneutral pathway. Knockout of the Nhe3 gene in mice resulted in a reduction of NaHCO3 resorption by proximal tubules of up to 60%. the main source of Na+/H+ absorption in the intestinal tract of mice was ablated. membrane proteins on mammalian cell membranes play important roles in the uptake of water-electrolytes and nutrients. the effects on the activity of NHE3 during diarrhea caused by TGEV infection have not been reported. EGFR may influence TGEV entrance, enhancing the ability of the virus to infect intestinal epithelial cells. it is important to explore this possible regulatory mechanism of the pathogenesis of diarrhea caused by TGEV infection in piglets. pLKO.1-TRC was used to generate control lentivival. cells in TGEV-Infected groups and un-infected groups were prepared to be transfected with the EGFR-specific shRNA plasmid. a premix comprising RPMI 1640 and 30 M AG1478 was evenly covered on surface. cells were infected with 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of TGEV per well. each dilution was added to eight replicated wells. solution was then diluted to 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 g/mL. intracellular and extracellular samples were diluted by 9.5 104-fold and 6 103-fold respectively. licate measurements were applied to calculate the average cycle threshold (Ct) for each individual test using the QuantStudioTM 3 System software. Western Blot Analysis Protein samples separated by SDS-PAGE were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Bio-Rad) the membranes were incubated with the following primary antibodies. the fluorescence intensity of the anchoring bleached region during the whole recovery process of fluorescence bleaching was detected and analyzed by the image analysis system of the Zen blue software (ZEISS, Germany) a t-test was used for statistical comparison and a p-value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. we selected AG1478 as the inhibitor of EGFR based on amino acid sequence of EGFR from NCBI. pLKO.1-EGFR-p-shRNA was designed to express short hairpin RNA. pLKO.1-TRC was used to generate control lentivival. 5% FBS, 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2. cells were infected with 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) of TGEV per well. each dilution was added to eight replicated wells. potassium (K) blank solution was prepared by dissolving 2.593 g of KNO3 in 50 mL of 5% HNO3. then diluting to 500 mL with deionized water to get a 5% HNO3+K solution containing 2 mg/mL of K. intracellular and extracellular samples were diluted by 9.5 104-fold and 6 103-fold. fluorescence recovery after photobleaching was used to determine the lateral mobility of pEGFP-NHE3 at the apical domain of polarized IPEC-J2 cells. the cells were cultured on glass-bottomed 35-mm plastic culture dishes in RPMI 1640 medium without phenol red. the region of interest (ROI) used to collect signal was located in a square of the apical domain (0.3 m) of the target cell. the mobile fraction and diffusion rate were then calculated. the deletion of the NHE3 gene profoundly weakened Na+ absorption. in mammals, the deletion of the NHE3 gene profoundly weakened Na+ absorption. in mammals, the deletion of the NHE3 gene profoundly weakened Na+ absorption. the effect of TGEV on Na+ concentration and the relative expression of NHE3 in IPEC-J2 cells. we used 30 M AG1478 as an EGFR inhibitor to suppress EGFR in IPEC-J2 cells. the average viral titer of the DMSO group was 106.84 TCID50/mL. the titer of the AG1478 group was 105.49 TCID50/mL. these data showed that proliferation of TGEV in IPEC-J2 cells could be reduced by inhibiting EGFR. EGFR inhibition could restore the function of Na+ absorption in TGEV-infected cells. intracellular Na+ concentration in IPEC-J2 cells after treatment with 30 M AG1478 or DMSO for 24 h. samples collected from cell culture medium were tested. the level of p-EGFR in the TGEV plus AG1478 group was significantly increased compared with that in the TGEV-infected group. however, the level of p-ERK in the TGEV-infected group was significantly lower than that in the TGEV-infected group. grayscale analysis of changes in p-EGFR/EGFR, p-ERK/ERK, and NHE3 levels. changes in p-EGFR/EGFR, p-ERK, and ERK levels were analyzed. each experiment was performed in triplicate. recombinant expression plasmid pEGFP-NHE3 was transfected into IPEC-J2 cells and cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the stable expression of the recombinant plasmid was observed under an inverted fluorescence microscope. the transient expression of green fluorescent protein was observed under the control of a CMV promoter. LSCM images captured before (A) and after (B) bleaching (63/1.4 NA) were selected to reflect the dynamic change of fluorescence bleaching and recovery in each group. the fluorescence recovery rate of NHE3 in cells infected with TGEV was significantly lower than that in the control group without TGEV infection. representative images of FRAP experiments in different groups of IPEC-J2 cells with TGEV infection or not. the results showed that the non-quenched fluorescence molecules gradually diffused from the unbleached region to the bleached area with increasing time, and the fluorescence of the bleached region gradually recovered. decreased EGFR activity in intestinal epithelial cells was accompanied by increased NHE3 mobility after TGEV infection. EGFR negatively regulates NHE3 mobility on plasma membrane in TGEV-infected cells. intra and extracellular Na+ levels in the control showed almost no change. TGEV infection affected intra- and extracellular Na+ concentration in piglet intestinal epithelial cells. results suggest TGEV infection caused consistent downregulation of NHE3 levels. we used Western blotting to assess its levels in TGEV-infected cells. we then used AG1478 as an EGFR inhibitor to suppress EGFR. the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay showed that cell viability was not reduced after EGFR inhibition. phosphorylated EGFR in IPEC-J2 cells infected with TGEV at 0, 48, and 72 h post-infection. 0.01 p 0.05, p 0.01. Inhibition of EGFR promotes Na+ absorption in TGEV-infected cells. e receptor EGFR can promote virus invasion of host cells and activate downstream signaling pathways. the most common pathway is the MAPK signaling pathway. the most common pathway is the MAPK signaling pathway. both phosphorylation levels of EGFR and ERK were significantly decreased compared with TGEV-infected group. knockdown of EGFR reduced the phosphorylation of EGFR and ERK in the TGEV-infected cells. each experiment was performed in trip. EGFR as a Crucial Protein Controls NHE3 Mobility in Cytomembrane Stable mobility of the brush border membrane is very important for the uptake of Na+ and water-electrolytes in the intestinal epithelium. the membrane transporter NHE3 is responsible for the electrically neutral translocation of Na+/H+ in intestinal epithelial cells. fluorescence observation of IPEC-J2 cells transfected with pEGFP-NHE3. cells were transfected with recombinant vector (pEGFP-NHE3) for different times. FRAP analysis of eight cells was then used to determine best time of fluorescence bleaching and recovery. the fluorescence recovery curves according to the fluorescence recovery rate were then drawn. the results showed that the fluorescence recovery rate of NHE3 in cells infected with TGEV was significantly lower than that in the control group without TGEV infection. the fluorescence recovery rate in cells transfected with the empty vector was the lowest compared with the other three groups, showing almost no recovery. the mobile fraction of NHE3 in TGEV-infected group decreased significantly by 54% (0.01 p 0.05) the mobile fraction of NHE3 in the TGEV plus AG1478 group increased by 33% compared with that in the TGEV group. EGFR negatively regulates NHE3 mobility on the plasma membrane in TGEV-infected cells. intracellular Na+ concentration increased before 48 h p.i., but decreased from 48 to 72 h p.i. extracellular Na+ concentration also increased, with a peak at 72 h p.i. it is believed that the Na+/H+ exchanger protein NHE3 has two main functions. dai et al. (2016) reported that SGLT1 protein levels were upregulated and glucose uptake in the small intestine was enhanced in the early stage of TGEV infection of IPEC-J2 cells. however, later, the glucose intake of the intestinal epithelium decreased. kockdown of EGFR downregulated the levels of p-EGFR and p-ERK. TGEV infection regulated NHE3 via the EGFR/ERK signaling pathway. there was a negative correlation between EGFR and NHE3. the main mechanism of this regulation is that PKC-dependent LPA could recognize LPA5R to activate EGFR and ERK, resulting in their phosphorylation. the mobile fraction of pEGFP-NHE3 in the uninfected cells was the highest and had the strongest mobility. activity and mobility of NHE3 decreased after TGEV infection. this decreased the Na+/H+ transport mediated by NHE3. inhibition of EGFR was beneficial to recovery of Na+ absorption in TGEV-infected cells."}
