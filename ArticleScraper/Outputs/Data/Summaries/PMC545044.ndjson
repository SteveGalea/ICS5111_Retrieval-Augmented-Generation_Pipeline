{"summary": "parameters studied included serum levels of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) IgG antibody, tests of lung function, and imaging data to evaluate changes in lung fibrosis. 81.2% (311 of 383 patients) tested positive for serum SARS-CoV IgG. positive SARS-CoV antibody decreased significantly during the 12 months after hospital discharge. femoral head necrosis was also investigated in those who complained of chronic bone and joint pain during the one year. the subjects of this study were 383 clinically diagnosed SARS patients in the convalescent phase (160 male and 223 female, average age 38.2 13.6 years) each clinical diagnosis was based on the Clinical Diagnosis Standard for SARS Patients. patients with positive SARS-CoV IgG and abnormal pulmonary diffusion received regular pulmonary function tests. the individual has a history of close contact with SARS patients or is part of a cluster of cases of SARS or there is clinical evidence of having infected other patients. symptoms and signs Acute onset of SARS generally begins with a prodrome of fever with a temperature >38\u00b0C. 1.2+2+4, 1.2+2+4+5, or 1.2+2+3+4. serum samples were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. wells were washed 5 times with the washing buffer. a tetramethyl-benzidine substrate was then added to each well. patients underwent a standard pulmonary function test for forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), vital capacity (VC), forced vital capacity (FVC), total lung capacity (TLC), transfer coefficient for carbon monoxide (DLCO) and carbon monoxide diffusion constant (DLCO/VA) the results were compared with those of age- and sex-matched controls. coronal T1-weighted (spin echo; time to repetition [TR], 440\u2013500; time to echo [TE] 11\u201314] scans of the hips were done. images 3 mm thick were obtained for coronal studies, and 4 mm thick images were obtained for the sagittal studies. study protocol The subjects of our investigation were 383 clinically diagnosed SARS patients in the convalescent phase (160 male and 223 female, average age 38.2 13.6 years) each clinical diagnosis was based on the clinical Diagnosis Standard for SARS Patients. each patient was given a routine pulmonary function test (ventilation and diffusion function: SensorMedics 2200 pulmonary function test apparatus, U.S.A.) the individual has a history of recent travel to an area where SARS cases have been reported within 2 weeks. acute onset of SARS generally begins with a prodrome of fever with a temperature >38\u00b0C, sometimes accompanied by chills, myalgia and anthralgia, headaches, and fatigue. there are no obvious pulmonary signs among SARS patients. the individual has a history of close contact with SARS patients or is part of a cluster of cases of SARS or there is clinical evidence of having infected other patients. symptoms and signs Acute onset of SARS generally begins with a prodrome of fever with a temperature >38\u00b0C. if present, it is mainly a dry cough, occasionally with blood streak sputum. 1.1+2+4, 1.2+2+4+5, or 1.2+2+4+4 were tested. the wells containing polystyrene microplate strips were coated with two recombinant antigens that are well-characterized. the wells were washed 5 times with the washing buffer. each recovering SARS patient underwent a standard pulmonary function test. the results were compared with those of age- and sex-matched controls. the results were compared with those of age- and sex-matched controls. coronal T1-weighted (spin echo; time to repetition [TR], 440\u2013500; time to echo [TE] 11\u201314] scans of the hips were done. images 3 mm thick were obtained for coronal studies, and 4 mm thick images were obtained for sagittal studies. the interval from hospital discharge to the first follow-up visit was 45.0 20.7 days. of the 383 individuals participating in our study, 311 patients (81.2%) tested positive for SARS-CoV IgG and 72 (18.8%) tested negative. 33 patients (13 male and 20 female, average age 35.7 12.1) received regular follow-up examinations each month. p 0.05 vs. SARS-CoV IgG antibody results in June, 2003. p 0.05 vs. SARS-CoV IgG antibody results in July, 2003. p 0.05 vs. SARS-CoV IgG antibody results in August, 2003. p 0.05 vs. SARS-CoV IgG antibody results in July, 2003. p 0.05 vs. SARS-CoV IgG antibody results in August, 2003. 88 individuals (23.0%) with abnormal DLCO among the 383 patients participating in our study. there were 23 who exhibited abnormal DLCO at their second pulmonary function examination, 23 at the third examination, and 20 at the fourth examination (table 4). follow-up* VC(% pred) DLCO(% pred) DLCO(% pred) DLCO(% pred) DLCO/VA(% pred) the results of chest HRCT examination in a SARS patient in the convalescent phase showed marked reversal of pulmonary fibrosis. of the 311 convalescent SARS patients with sero-positive SARS-CoV IgG, 78 received femoral head MRI examinations. ten of the 18 patients showed first stage changes and 8 had secondary changes. the CDC SARS case definition emphasizes the importance of laboratory criteria for the confirmation of a SARS diagnosis. this is accomplished by detecting the dynamic changes in the titration of specific antibodies against SARS CoV and positive detection of SARS-CoV RNA by PCR. however, the Chinese clinical diagnosis standard did not mention the importance of a laboratory SARS-CoV test. avascular necrosis develops on the femoral head. the morbidity of this condition is reported to be 15% to 30% in some patients in Mainland China [8,10] there were 18 cases of complicated necrosis of the femoral head."}
