{"summary": "pathogens include rabies, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, ebola, marburg, Nipah and Hendra virus. pathogen spillover events are often associated with sharp increases, or pulses, in pathogen prevalence that vary in amplitude and timing [4\u20136] but the mechanisms driving these pulses are unknown. longitudinal studies across time and space are necessary to identify such factors. P. alecto is of particular concern because this species is widely distributed in coastal North Eastern Australia, and often forages in urban and peri-urban areas. changes in bat abundance over areas with different levels of human development is important for disease management because such changes are likely to affect the frequency of Hendra virus outbreaks. field et al. collected urine from plastic sheets that were divided into quadrants and placed under bat roosts. urine samples may have contained urine from up to four species of flying foxes. we excluded sites with fewer data because they were insufficient to quantify pulse periodicity and synchrony. sites spanned the latitudinal gradient of Hendra virus occurrence in eastern Australia. the results from this model showed significant temporal and spatial effects on Hendra virus prevalence. however, due to logistical challenges in field sampling, site-specific time series had missing prevalence data. we therefore used a multiple imputation protocol that allowed us to predict missing values for the time series of the 11 sites. for each site, we extracted both the timing and amplitude of the largest amplitude annual pulse (i.e. omitting the predicted values) for each site, we extracted both the timing and amplitude of the largest amplitude annual pulse (i.e. omitting the predicted values) for each site, we extracted both the timing and amplitude of the largest amplitude annual pulse (for this analysis, we also included the Boonah data collected in 2011). we used generalized mixed-effects models to test the effects of temperature, precipitation and bat abundance on Hendra virus pulse amplitude and timing. for each location, we used average values of precipitation, minimum temperatures and maximum temperatures at four different times. pooled urine samples may have contained urine from up to four species of flying foxes. the data also contain qualitative counts of bat species, P. alecto, Pteropus scapulatus, P. conspicillatus and Pteropus poliocephalus. we excluded sites with fewer data because they were insufficient to quantify pulse periodicity and synchrony. on the 11 sites with sufficient data, we fit a generalized mixed-effects model to quantify the effects of among-sheet, among-site and among-year variation. the sampling sheet, sampling site and the year of sampling were fit as random effects. missing values were predicted by fitting a polynomial function of time that also considered the prevalence values of neighboring sites in the form of prior information. these priors were thus built using the mean and variance in Hendra virus prevalence across sites, within 300 km. we fit a quadratic effect of pulse timing to test whether the largest amplitudes occurred more often over winter (i.e. calendar months 6\u20138) and included the latitudinal coordinate of each site as a fixed effect to test for latitudinal gradients. this model accounted for the effects of sampling site and year by fitting these variables as random effects. we used climatic factors measured at previous times to quantify delayed effects of climate on pulse amplitude and timing. at the time of the pulse, we examined whether bat species density had an effect on the amplitude and the timing of the pulse. in each scenario, we fit either the pulse amplitude or pulse timing as response variables, with average precipitation, minimum temperature, maximum temperature and the natural log of bat density as explanatory fixed effects. the sampling sheet, sampling site and the year of sampling were fit as random effects in a mixed-effects logistic regression model using the package MCMCglmm in R [28]. the map shows the temporal variation in Hendra virus prevalence for 11 sites marked with \u2018*\u2019 in the map. the smallest dots are instances when Hendra virus prevalence = 0.. our preliminary analyses showed that the prediction of numerous sequential missing values was poor (Fig. 1). we only used predicted data over the time between January 2012 to November 2014. wavelet transforms are useful to detect periodic signals that are localized in time [30] we used a non-parametric covariance function which fits a smoothing spline to estimate the change of cross-correlations with geographical distance [33]. Statistical inference was based on the 95th percentiles from 104 bootstraps which re-sampled site-specific time series with replacement to re-calculate cross-correlations. we also conducted these analyses using data in which missing values were predicted without prior information. we used z-tests for statistical inference when modeling pulse amplitudes, and t tests when modeling pulse timings. we only consider an effect to be significant if a P-value adjustment to control for false discovery rate was 005 [36] wavelet analyses captured significant periodic signals over short periods (approximately 2\u20136 months) at the intensively sampled Boonah roost, peaks in Hendra virus prevalence occurred with a 6-month period from January 2013 to January 2014. quadratic coefficient = 0038, z-value = \u2013209, P-value = 0037) but only when we removed one outlier datum associated with a pulse measured in Boonah in January 2012. this result suggests that qualitative characteristics of pulses may be similar between sites, even if overall Hendra virus prevalence does differ between sites. top figure shows pairwise correlation coefficients between time series of Hendra virus prevalence as a function of geographical distance. bottom figure shows pairwise correlations of the change in Hendra virus prevalence. density of P. poliocephalus, but not P. scapulatus, had a significant effect on pulse amplitude. top right and bottom panels show the effect of previous precipitation on pulse timing and pulse amplitude. previous climatic conditions influenced both pulse amplitude and timing. lower precipitation during the previous spring was associated with increased pulse amplitudes. seasonal signal suggests that variation in pulse amplitudes and timings occur because of combined effects of density-driven processes involving P. alecto. low food availability is a potential factor that could increase transmission or viral shedding via reduced immunocompetence. reduced rainfall could increase transmission by increasing contact rates between individuals aggregating around suitable habitats. P. scapulatus and Hendra virus prevalence was due to dilution of positive samples by P. scapulatus urine. increased food availability may then reduce Hendra virus shedding by improving bat condition and immunocompetence. a third possibility is that prevalence in P. alecto may be reduced by high P. scapulatus abundance. we found low but significant levels of population synchrony in prevalence. the mechanisms that drive synchrony are difficult to discern because animal movement or shared environmental conditions can synchronize disease dynamics. we therefore suggest that Hendra virus dynamics are mostly driven by the biotic and abiotic conditions at relatively small spatial scales. a future challenge in the study of bat\u2013Hendra virus dynamics is to determine how Eucalyptus phenology, bat movement, temperature, and nutritional status interact to affect Hendra virus prevalence. climate change is predicted to increase the frequency of extreme weather events such as heat waves and tropical cyclones."}
