{"summary": "the aim of the study was to evaluate cases developing pneumothorax following admission to a pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) over a 5-year period. 135 cases (10.4%) developed pneumothorax, and these were compared with those who did not. most common tool for diagnosis was chest X-ray followed by a clinical examination. mothorax is the accumulation of extrapulmonary air within the chest. iatrogenic pneumothorax (IP) is more common worldwide. iatrogenic pneumothorax (IP) is more common worldwide. patients were categorized into two groups: group 1, those who developed pneumothorax, and group 2, who did not. patients were categorized into two groups: group 1, those who developed pneumothorax, and group 2, who did not. 10.4% (n = 135) of patients developed 151 episodes of pneumothorax (Group 1). the remaining patients 89.6% (n = 1163) did not (Group 2). IP represented 95% of episodes of pneumothorax. barotrauma secondary to MV accounted for 69.6%, 41.1% of which were tension pneumothoraces, central venous catheter (CVC) insertion accounted for 13.2%. other causes including transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial, or pleural biopsy accounted for 17.2%. patients with pneumothorax usually have extra 4.4 days added to the LOS, an extra cost of $18000 US, and have a 6% higher risk of hospital death. mortality rate was 59% in Group 1 compared to 10% in Group 2. the risk factor for acquiring pneumothorax was high in some diagnostic categories of patients such as those with respiratory diseases (39.4% vs. 23.9%) and sepsis and septic shock (34.8% vs. 24.1%) pneumonia is an important predisposing factor in the development of pulmonary barotrauma in mechanically ventilated patients. a number of studies have concluded that the incidence of barotrauma does not relate to ventilator mode. a number of studies have concluded that the incidence of barotrauma does not relate to ventilator mode. pneumothorax in mechanically ventilated patients is related to underlying lung disease along with high ventilatory settings. most cases of pneumothorax were iatrogenic caused by barotrauma and CVC insertion coming next."}
