{"summary": "oligonucleotide-based technologies are being developed as drug platforms. phosphorothioates, 2\u2032-O-Me (10,11), 2\u2032-O-allyl (10,11), 2\u2032-deoxy-fluorouridine (8,9) have been examined as a means to improve the prospect for siRNA therapy. modified siRNAs exhibit enhanced serum stability (11) and longer duration of action (10) modification of the 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand resulted in a dramatic loss in activity consistent with the proposed in vivo requirement for 5\u2032 end phosphorylation. more substantial modifications, such as total modification by 2\u2032-O-Me (8) or PS modifications of every second or all internucleoside linkages (8,9) increased cytotoxic effects and resulted in a significant decrease or complete loss siRNA and siLNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Santaris A/S. siRNA was ordered from MedProbe and DNA oligonucleotides from Invitrogen. target sequences have been described elsewhere. ligation of a double-stranded DNA oligonucleotide corresponding to the SARS 3 target site. Xba I overhangs into the Xba I site in the pGL3-plasmid. the sense or antisense direction of the insert was confirmed after ligation by PCR and sequencing. HEK 293 cells were seeded in 500 l antibiotic-free medium in 24-well plates the day before transfection. the standard co-transfection mix was prepared for triplicate samples by adding 510 ng pGL3-Control, 51 ng pRL-TK and 340 ng siRNA to 150 l Opti-MEM I. the final volume of medium plus transfection mix was 600 l and the final siRNA concentration was 13 nM. siRNA and siLNA inhibition experiments were performed in PC12 cells. mRNA was extracted 24 h post-transfection. inhibition of SARS-CoV-induced cytotoxicity followed similar procedure. an amount of 400\u2013800 ng of DNase-treated total RNA was used as template for first strand DNA synthesis according to the manufacturer's protocol. an aliquot (one-twentieth) of the cDNA reaction were analyzed by quantitative Real-Time PCR on an ABI PRISM 7000 (Applied Biosystems) gene-specific primers and probes for the target genes NPY and cyclophilin A (24,26) were mixed separately with TaqMan the different siRNA sequences were used as unrelated controls in non-overlapping systems. pGL3-Control coding for firefly luciferase and pRL-TK coding for Renilla luciferase. samples were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 3 min and slowly cooled to 20\u00b0C. melting curves were recorded at 260 nm using a heating rate of 1\u00b0C/min, a slit of 2 nm and a response of 0.2 s. solutions were mixed and incubated for 20\u201330 min before 100 l of the mix was added to each of three wells. the final volume of medium plus transfection mix was 600 l and the final siRNA concentration was 13 nM. the cells were harvested 24 h later and luciferase activity was measured. luciferase activity was assessed according to the dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay protocol (Promega) a 10 l sample were placed in each well of a 96-well plate. 50 l Luciferace Assay Reagent II (substrate for firefly luciferase) was added to each well. siRNA and siLNA (7 M) were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen) diluted in phosphate-buffered saline, 100% human or 100% mouse serum. Aliquots of 5 l were withdrawn at different time points and immediately frozen in 15 l 1.5 TBE-loading buffer. siRNA1 was markedly degraded after 6 h during which it produces a smear of faster migrating species. a similar diffuse band was not observed with the 3\u2032 end protected siLNA5, which showed only weak signs of degradation after 24 h. the more modified siLNA7 had a striking stability and showed no signs of degradation even at 48 h. siRNA1 effectively and selectively reduced firefly luciferase activity. one LNA in the 5\u2032 end of the sense strand was fully compatible with activity (siLNA4 and 5), while an LNA at the 5\u2032 end of the antisense strand dramatically impaired the inhibitory effect. this procedure did not recover any of the lost effect. activity and the uninhibited activity was set to 100%. the total siLNA/siRNA concentration was kept constant at 13 nM. the ratio of effective and irrelevant siLNA/siRNA was varied. unmodified NPY siRNA (siRNA3) reduced the mRNA levels considerably. an unrelated control, siRNA against dopamine D2 receptor, did not. however, an LNA 5\u2032 antisense modification substantially impaired activity. single RNA to LNA substitutions were tolerated at base-paired positions in the antisense strand of the firefly luciferase siLNA1. the notable exceptions are positions 10 (siLNA30), 12 (siLNA32) and 14 (siLNA34), where introduction of LNA leads to a clear decrease of inhibitory activity. this is unlikely given the functionality of many significantly more modified siLNAs. the replacement at position 12 (siRNA32) substituted an RNA-A for an LNA-A. this indicates that factors other than helical structure or accessibility are also important for proper catalytic activity. a change thermodynamic fingerprint of the siRNA in the vicinity of the cleavage site is likely to be a factor. a priori would serve to restore the relative binding energies of the two ends of the siRNA. a target region derived from the SARS virus was cloned into the 3\u2032UTR of the firefly luciferase gene in both the sense (pS3Xs) and antisense (pS3Xas) orientation. the SARS siRNA (Table 1) has identical closing base-pairs at both ends (A:U) making it likely enough of both the antisense and sense strand would be incorporated into RISC to observe activity on the respective siRNA and siLNA were tested against control plasmid pGL3. both siRNAs have strong G:C base-pair and weak A:U base-pair. both siRNAs have strong G:C base-pair at their antisense end. nM siRNA or siLNA was infected with 6000 TCID50 SARS-CoV. the untransfected but infected sample was set to 100% cytotoxicity. mean and SD values in the Renilla case are from two experiments performed in triplicate. siRNA1 was markedly degraded after 6 h during which it produces a smear of faster migrating species. the more modified siLNA7 had a striking stability and showed no signs of degradation even at 48 h. siLNA7 remained intact for the full 48 h of the assay. different siLNA/siRNA were incubated in 10% foetal bovine serum at 37\u00b0C. the oligos were separated by PAGE and visualized with SYBR gold. \u2018ds\u2019 depicts double-stranded siRNA marker and \u2018ss\u2019 single-stranded. in the 3\u2032 overhangs and at as many as seven base-paired positions (siLNA6 and 7) retained significant inhibitory activity. siLNAs comprising various combinations of either fully modified sense or antisense strands did not have any inhibitory effect. effect of different LNA loads on activity of siRNAs against exogenous (a) firefly luciferase gene, (c) Renilla luciferase or (d) endogenous NP the uninhibited normalized NPY mRNA level was set to 100%. the mean and SD values in the case of luciferase are from two independent experiments performed in triplicate. the firefly siLNAs, the lightly modified siLNA5 and the medium modified siLNA7 were further compared to the unmodified siRNA1 in a dose\u2013response experiment. unmodified NPY siRNA (siRNA3) reduced mRNA levels considerably. unrelated control, siRNA against dopamine D2 receptor, did not. Sense strand LNA modifications were well tolerated with both lightly modified (siLNA18) and medium modified (siLNA19). mean and SD values are derived from two or more experiments. the LNA substitutions at position 10 and 14 exchanged an RNA-U for an LNA-T and an RNA-C for an LNA-mC both of which lead to the introduction of an additional methyl-group on the nucleobase. this new compound displayed activity similar to the unmodified siRNA (siRNA1), thus lending support to the importance of having native nucleobases close to the cleavage site if relative binding energies at the ends of the siRNA duplex determine strand bias, it should be possible to favour incorporation of the antisense strand by selectively enhancing the affinity of the 5\u2032 sense end with LNA. this intriguing possibility was hinted at by previous observations that activity loss due to LNA incorporation at the 5\u2032 antisense end could be largely rescued by compensatory modifications. both siRNA and siLNA inhibited the sense target (pS3Xas) both siRNA and siLNA were tested against the control plasmid pGL3. however, when tested for sense strand activity, the outcome was different. siRNA showed clear downregulation of the target (pS3Xas) the activity of both siRNAs was improved by the 5\u2032 sense LNA modification. siRNA4 reduced residual luciferase activity from 57 to 18% (siLNA 40) and siRNA5 from 71 to 49% (siLNA 41). further stabilization by LNA of their 5\u2032 sense end is not expected to lead to improved activity. however, the modestly effective SARS-3 siRNA showed the expected improvement when modified with LNA. a generally greater reduction or increase in cytotoxicity was noted at the lower and higher titers. a combination of two or more activity-impairing LNA modifications may facilitate complete loss of activity of RISC complexes inappropriately loaded with sense strands. the ability to influence strand loading by LNA modification at the 5\u2032 sense end also provides an opportunity to improve the potency of ineffective siRNAs by further enhancing antisense strand incorporation. the RNA-like character of LNA combined with its enhanced biophysical characteristics, e.g. increased nuclease resistance and affinity, enabled us to construct hybrid RNA\u2013LNA molecules with new and favourable properties."}
