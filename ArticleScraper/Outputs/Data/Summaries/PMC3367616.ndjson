{"summary": "deforestation of tropical forests is 1 cause of increasing contact between wildlife and hunters. clear-cut logging may be less likely to result in zoonotic emergence than selective extraction because of the relatively low contact rate between people and wildlife during clear-cutting. logging generally involves constructing roads and transporting workers into relatively pristine forest regions. this phenomenon has only been demonstrated for 1 pathogen, Borrelia burgdorferi, the causative agent of Lyme disease. fragmentation increases the relative abundance of the highly competent reservoir, the white-footed mouse (Peromyscus leucopus) and results in a higher risk for infection to humans. anthropologic studies of bushmeat should include the details of hunting, but also the transportation of meat to the village, the market, the kitchen, and onto the table. the demand for bushmeat in west and central Africa is as much as 4 times greater than that in the Amazon Basin (10). estimates of the extraction rate in the Congo Basin suggest that >282.3 g of bushmeat per person per day may be eaten there, with 4.5 million tons of bushmeat extracted annually (17). Various Localized outbreaks Human presence in region for habitation, work or leisure X (5,19, 20) Ebola Unknown Localized epidemics, short timescale Hunting or wildlife necropsy X X (22) HIV-1 and -2 Chimpanzee, sooty mangabe Repeated single infections or localized outbreaks followed by national then global emergence Hunting & butchering nonhuman primates X X (23) Anthrax Ungulates Single infections or local the bushmeat market among households for sauce preparation in Yaound\u00e9 alone is estimated at $4 million annually. the poorest quantiles spent 16% and 17% of their meat budgets on bushmeat versus 7% for the richest quantile and 9% overall. the global emergence of a zoonotic pathogen such as SARS requires 3 steps. simian foamy viruses infect bushmeat hunters regularly, so far without evidence of human-to-human transmission. simian foamy viruses infect bushmeat hunters regularly, so far without evidence of human-to-human transmission. avian influenza and Hendra viruses are examples of the second stage towards global emergence. in the environmental conditions in which monkeypox and Nipah viruses emerged, R0 was 1 and ultimately the epidemics faded out (22) a pathogen will fade to extinction. changes to human behavior that increase the transmission of viruses between people will increase R0 and the risk for new epidemic zoonoses. the high rates of viral chatter observed in cameroon suggest a strong potential for their emergence as a human-to-human transmitted pathogen. the high rates of viral chatter suggest a strong potential for their emergence as a human-to-human transmitted pathogen. the fusion of these diverse fields will allow the first steps to be taken towards emerging disease research's ultimate challenge of predicting new zoonotic disease emergence."}
