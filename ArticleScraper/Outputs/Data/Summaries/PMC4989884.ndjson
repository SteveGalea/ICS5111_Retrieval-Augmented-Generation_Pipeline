{"summary": "novel human viral pathogens are emerging with increasing frequency. majority of these pathogens have an animal reservoir and an RNA genome. RNA viruses have a highly error-prone polymerase used for genome replication. virulence was associated with increased age of the rodent as well as mutations in the viral genome. the precise mechanism(s) by which in vivo passage leads to increased virulence are not clear. the exact mechanism(s) by which in vivo passage leads to increased virulence is not clear. selenium and vitamin E are antioxidants and function to control oxidative stress that is induced as part of the host response to infection. the effect of oxidative stress on viral evolution has been demonstrated in a variety of viruses (influenza, coxsackie, polio, Sendai, and human immunodeficiency virus) and hosts (mouse, human) bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL) containing SeV from the three dietary conditions was used to infect guinea pigs under normal dietary conditions. viral titers, viral titers, and cytokine profiles were used to characterize viral virulence within the hosts. mice were fed a ND, or selenium deficient diet for 7 weeks, or a high FD 15 weeks prior to infection. the high FD (D12331, Research Diets, New Brunswick, NJ) contained 58 kcal% fat (coconut and soybean oils) guinea pigs diets did not vary (all on ND) and were infected intranasally with 0.25 ml. at day 7-post infection the guinea pigs were euthanized and lung lavage and lung homogenate were collected. Plaques were visualized by adding 300 l MTT solution (1/10 volume of agarose plug: 5 mg/ml tetrazolium sallt, MTT (Sigma) in PBS filtered. wells were infected with 100 ul of BAL from infected mice. plaques were collected and resuspended in 1 ml of unsupplemented DMEM overnight. plaques were then amplified in LLC-MK2 cells and supernatant harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C on day 7. PCR products were prepared for sequencing using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit. dilutions of control plasmids containing inserts from seV, rabies virus (RABV) and bovine coronavirus (BCoV) were combined at following ratios 100,000 SeV: 1,000 RABV: 10 BCoV. amplification efficiency was affected by slight differences in plasmid insert size between the controls. the ratio of RABV to BCoV insert was about 88.5, much closer to the expected value of 100. 2.8 Sequencing data analysis Read mapping and rare variant detection was performed as described previously in Chen-Harris et al. (2013). tropy of the HN gene was calculated to track changes in intra-host viral diversity. entropy is calculated as j i = 1 4 f i * log ( f i) / N where entropy is calculated for each position j in the gene and fi is the relative frequency of each of the 4 nts. structural and stereochemical quality of the model was checked using a contact-dot algorithm in the MolProbity software package. the final constructed model was finished with relaxation using UCSF Chimera (Pettersen et al. 2004) the regions of interfaces between subunits were defined by identifying amino acids that are from different chains but have atoms in a distance closer than 3.10 Cytokine/chemokine expression Quantitative PCR was used to measure expression of host cytokine genes in lung homogenate using TRIzol LS Reagent (Invitrogen). cytokines and chemokines IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-, CCL2 (MCP-1), CCL3 (MIP1), CCL4 (MIP1), CCL5 (RANTES), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) mice fed a ND, or selenium deficient diet for 7 weeks, or a high FD 15 weeks prior to infection. tized with ketamine and xylazine, inoculated intranasally with 25 l of stock virus (passage 1) or tracheal lavage fluid from infected mice. mice were monitored daily for weight loss and visually inspected twice daily for signs of disease such as lethargy, ruffled fur, and hunching. a veterinary pathologist evaluated tissues and score for pathology. tissues were scored as follows: 0 = no change; 1 = minimal change; 2 = mild inflammation and/or pneumocyte hypertrophy; 3 = moderate inflammation and/or pneumocyte hypertrophy; 5 = marked inflammation and/or pneumocyte hypertrophy affecting 50% of lung lobe. wells were overlaid with 3 ml of 2 MEM (Life Technologies, Gibco) with 100 IU/ml Penicillin/100 g/ml Streptomycin (Gibco), 2% BSA (Gibco), 2 g/ml of TPCK trypsin (Sigma) and 2% agarose. single plaques were collected and resuspended in 1 ml of unsupplemented DMEM (Life Technologies), xamers and the superscript III RT reverse transcriptase kit were amplified using the Phusion polymerase kit. PCR conditions consisted of 98\u00b0C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 15 s, 64\u00b0C for 20 s, and 72\u00b0C for 1.2 min. the final cycle was 72\u00b0C for 10 min. detecting BCoV seqeuences would mean a variant detection sensitivity of 1 in 10,000 copies (0.01%) however, amplification efficiency was affected by slight differences in plasmid insert size between the controls. the ratio of RABV to BCoV insert was about 10 more than expected ratio of 100. software was created to link Illumina reads aligned to regions nearby on the reference and construct viral haplotypes. the resulting haplotypes were experimentally verified using cloning and Sanger sequencing. a set of initial structural models was created to assess regions of sequence-structure conservation or variability in the modeled Sendai HN protein. the structural and stereochemical quality of the model was checked using a contact-dot algorithm in the MolProbity software package. analysis was performed by StralSV (Zemla et al. 2011) applied to all sixty-one currently available variants (PDB chains) of structural models of paramyxovirus HNs deposited in PDB based on results published by Connaris et al. (2002). cytokine homogenates were centrifuged for 10 min at 1,000 rpm at 4\u00b0C. cytokines/chemokines were coupled to cytokine/chemokine specific multi-plex beads. chemokine/cytokine expression analysis was carried out using an unpaired Student\u2019s t-test. changes in expression levels were consider significant if P 0.05. nt/amino acid substitution analysis was performed using Mann-Whitney U test. mouse weight loss was determined as a measure of morbidity following intranasal infection with each serial passage. infection with SeV led to statistically significant weight loss under all dietary conditions. guinea pigs infected with seed virus or P10 BAL from ND, FD or SD mice had significantly higher lung histopathology scores. guinea pigs infected with P10 BAL from each diet group had significantly higher lung histopathology scores than those infected with BAL from the FD mouse group. analysis of gene expression changes in guinea pigs infected with P10 virus yielded little to no differences in expression levels of Ccl2, Ifng, or Il-1b compared with seed virus. expression levels of Tnf were between 1.5- and 2.0-fold higher in guinea pigs infected with the P10 virus inoculum from the different diets groups. SD mice infected with SeV P1 showed a statistically significant lower expression level of CCL2, CCL3, CXCL2, CXCL10, IL-6, IL-10, IFN, and TNF compared with P1 of ND or FD mice. infection of SD mice with P10 resulted in statistically lower expression of CCL2 and IL-6 compared with P1 from ND or FD mice. the average number of positive PCR results per region was compared with the viral titer (PFU/ml) and to the Ct (cycle threshold) average of two replicates. there was no correlation between PCR outcome and viral titer as determined by plaque assay (r = 0.35) in phenotype from P1 and P10, only 20 nt mutations occurring at consensus sequence level were detected in any of the samples. a majority of these consensus mutations occurred in the polymerase protein L and the glycoprotein HN. guinea pig no. 2 (GP2) infected with FD mouse inoculum (FD.GP2) in 95% of reads. nt variants at nt 2159, (C to G or C to A) were detected in most of the other samples at 10% frequency. high-frequency variants were also detected at nt 8,053, 8,073, and 8,265 of the HN gene. nt 8,073 a G to A substitution resulting in a non-synonymous change, E461K, occurred between 3 and 22% in the P1 population compared with 8.5% in the seed inoculum. the third high-frequency variant present in the HN gene was detected at nt 8,265 and resulted in a K525Q non-synonymous consensus mutation. single sample ND3.P1 was detected at 59%. a consensus change in the polymerase gene at nt 11,925 resulted in amino acid residue 1,124 changing from an asparagine to aspartic acid (N1124D) the frequency of residue 1124D in the P1 sample ranged from 1.2 to 76% while the P10 samples ranged from 13 to 71%. the frequency of these three amino acid substitutions was highly correlated across the samples. the linkage association between the alleles at these three positions was highly significant at P-value 10300 for all samples sequenced. homology model of HN protein from SeV is structurally compared with HN proteins from HPIV3, Sv5, NDV, Bat Paramyxovirus (GH-M74a), Nipah and Hendra viruses. regions identified as structurally conserved are colored from green when Calpha\u2013Calpha deviations in corresponding residues are 2 to red (>6 ). mutation positions are located in the regions identified as variable in sequence according to calculated multiple sequence alignments between HN proteins of paramyxovirus sequences from UniProt. results from the sequence conservation analysis suggest that two mutation positions (454, 461) are located in the regions conserved in structure. eight groups of mice were infected with homogeneous or heterogeneous mixtures. the egg-passaged seed stock used to infect mice for P1 was a \u2018high diversity\u2019 control because it contains a full mutant spectrum versus the other inocula that contained one to six clones. infection with the high-diversity seed stock displayed the greatest virulence as compared with the other clone preparations.

(1992) analysis of about eight clones per sample revealed that most samples had a mixture of nts at nt 20. however, all of the 85 clones that were sequenced in this study had an A at nt 24. our data confirm the variability of nt site 20 as described by Fujii et al. position 525 is located in the structurally variable region, while the two other positions can be considered as structurally conserved on the backbone level among number of closely related viruses. observations suggest that these positions are not involved in some critical function of the protein where conservation in both structure and sequence would be expected but they may play an important role to help virus adjustment to particular conditions. clones were selected which represented the predominant genotypes present in the mutant spectra and were tested for virulence via mouse infections. the clone with polymerase mutation D1124 (Genotype 2) was the only clone that resulted in significant weight loss for some of the mice and increased histopathology. diet-induced obesity has been demonstrated to alter cytokine profiles in mice. study found altered cytokine profiles in uninfected FD mice compared with SD and ND mice. however, further analysis of cytokine profiles between the dietary groups found SD mice infected with SeV had a suppressed immune response. in-depth data analysis is likely to be critical for understanding the mechanisms of viral host jumps and the role of the viral mutant spectra in vaccine efficacy and reversion."}
