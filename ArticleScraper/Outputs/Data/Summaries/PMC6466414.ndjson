{"summary": "next generation sequencing (NGS) can detect viruses at low concentrations and often provides sequence reads from across the entire genome. this approach can also detect divergent lineages that may not be amplified using traditional polymerase chain reaction approaches. there are several theories regarding why bats rarely experience pathogenesis with infection. one is that they have to deal with the physiological stress of flight. the unique innate immune system of bats may allow them to co-exist with viruses. urine was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 3 min to pellet debris. extracted and DNase I digested RNA was treated with Ribo-ZeroTM Gold rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) 500 bp cDNA libraries were constructed using agarose gel DNA recovery kit. trimming was executed using Trimmomatic-0.3.2 to remove adapters, low quality bases (Q = 20 with a sliding window 4) and reads with fewer than 50 bp length. DIAMOND outputs were imported into MEGAN6 for the taxonomic binning of reads. X174 phage reads were removed from the final data set as these are spiked-in as control for the next generation sequencing reaction. bp bands from the orthoreovirus assay were excised, gel purified with Qiagen QIAquick Gel Purification kit and sent for Sanger sequencing. phylogenetic analysis Candidate reads from mammalian-specific viruses were de novo assembled in Geneious 7.1.6 (Biomatters Ltd., Auckland, New Zealand) a general time reversible model and robustness of the nodes was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates. adenoviridae DNA polymerase 227 37 885 Flaviviridae E\u2013Envelope 398 45 333 NS5\u2013Non-structural protein 5 600 47 231 Papillomaviridae V3\u2013minor capsid protein 368 36 969 Paramyxoviridae N\u2013Nucleoprotein 15 14 720 g of feces was collected and placed in a 50-mL tube. urine was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 3 min to pellet debris. RNA-zol was added to urine viral supernatant and RNA extracted. DIAMOND outputs were imported into MEGAN6 for the taxonomic binning of reads and visualizing the distribution of virus family reads. X174 phage reads were removed from the final data set as these are spiked-in as control for the next generation sequencing reaction.
