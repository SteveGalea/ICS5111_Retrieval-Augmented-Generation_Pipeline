{"summary": "a variety of laboratory techniques have been used to survey the epidemiology of animal infectious diseases. these methods typically involve pathogen isolation and identification, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, real-time RT-PCR, and sequencing analyses. these methods cannot monitor and provide an early warning for pathogens of other animal diseases and viruses that have not yet been sequenced. sample collection Six large-scale farms (more than 10,000 poultry per farm) were selected at random. samples were stored in 0.5 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) mixture of 0.5 L of recombinant DNase I (RNase-free, 5 U/L) and 0.5 L ribonuclease A (RNase A, 10 mg/mL) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min to digest nucleic acids that were out of cells and virus particles.

BLAST results of the NGS library sequences were opened in MEGAN. the sequences of the avian influenza viruses detected in the six NGS libraries were extracted into respective FASTA files. the software has got the Computer Software Copyright Registration Certificate (No. 2804125) from the National Copyright Administration of the PRC. PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Inc.), cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China), and then sequenced using synthetic oligonucleotides. the PCR products were purified and cloned into the pMD18-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China) and then sequenced. the obtained nucleotide sequences of the RT-PCR products (about 1600 bp) and the deduced amino acid sequences of the IBV S1 genes were aligned using MUSCLE software. a fragment including the altered fusion protein (F) cleavage site was amplified using the reported primers F1 and F2 [23]. PCR products were purified and cloned into the pMD18-T vector. their proteolytic cleavage sites were analyzed to understand the pathogenicity of NDV[35, 36]. BLASTx analysis of reads located in env gene showed that the (ALV) in this farm belonged to subtype J, which was an endogenous ALV. the goose farm in anhui province had the lowest number of detected viruses (one species, AIV subtype H9N2) the duck farm in anhui province had the lowest number of detected viruses (one species, AIV subtype H9N2) Phylogenetic analysis of the HA nucleotide sequences generated by PCR in the five H9N2 AIVs showed that all five detected H9N2 AIVs were in the h9.4.2.5 lineage. h9.4.2.5 lineage is the current epidemic lineage in china. the three detected IBVs were identified as 4/91, CK/CH/LSC/99I, J2, 4/91, JP, TW, Italy02, TC07-2 and Mass. these three genotypes were also previously found in china [38] but had not been the most frequently isolated type (LX4) in China in recent years. the sequences start at the AUG translation initiation codon. the obtained nucleotide sequences of the RT-PCR products (about 1600 bp) and the deduced amino acid sequences of the IBV S1 genes were aligned using MUSCLE software. the phylogenetic tree was calculated using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. each virus identified in the total viral reads was listed in Table 1. the proportion of reads that were classified as viral (compared to eukaryotic and bacterial) and of each virus identified in the total viral reads was listed in Table 1. sample NGS Detection Results /PCR (RT-PCR) Detection Results AIV NDV IBV genotype AIV NDV Rotavirus DHBV ALV-J Subtype Lineage HA cleavage site Genotype F0 cleavage site AC Detection results +/+ +/+ -/- +/+ -/- +/+ -/- +/+ H9N2 H9.2.4.5 335 RSSRGLF 341 / 57,658 NGS: Next Generation Sequencing; PCR: polymerase chain reaction; RT-PCR: reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction; DHBV: avian influenza virus; DHBV: duck hepatitis B virus; HA: hemagglutinin. all the 36 detected IBVs were in the h9.4.2.5 lineage (Fig 1). the phylogenetic tree was calculated using the maximum likelihood (ML) method with the GTR+G+I substitution model and 1000 bootstraps. sequences start at the AUG translation initiation codon. phylogenetic tree was calculated using the maximum likelihood (ML) method. the scale bar indicates the branch length. the nucleotide sequences of the fragments amplified by RT-PCR are available from GenBank. phylogenetic analysis of rotavirus G, DHBV, and ALV-J was based on the sequence of PCR fragments. the results were validated by traditional PCR or RT-PCR techniques. the absence of pathogens on farms where none were detected by NGS was not confirmed. despite the high cost of NGS, only six samples were detected using the PGM platform in this study. despite the preliminary nature of this work, it employed novel laboratory techniques for detecting animal infectious diseases detection. once the cost of NGS falls, it will provide a routine detection method for testing large numbers of animal samples."}
