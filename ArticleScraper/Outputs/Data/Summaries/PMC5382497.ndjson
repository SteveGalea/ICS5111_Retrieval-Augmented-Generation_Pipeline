{"summary": "feed contaminated with feces from infected pigs is believed to be a potential route of transmission of porcine delta coronavirus. the objective of this study was to determine if the addition of commercial feed additives (e.i., acids, salt and sugar) to swine feed can be an effective strategy to inactive PDCoV. feed additives contained phosphoric acid, citric acid, or fumaric acid were the most effective in reducing virus survival. none of these additives completely inactivated the virus by 10- days post-inoculation."}
