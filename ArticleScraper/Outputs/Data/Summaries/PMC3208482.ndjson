{"summary": "mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequencing and mutation detection. failure by the microarray to identify a base, compared to the reference sequence, is designated an 'N-call' this study re-examined the N-call distribution of mtDNA samples. study examining sequence variations within human mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) has been based on restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) analysis. more rapid sequencing using microarrays-based resequencing is being used in clinical and research laboratories for identifying mutations. failure of the MitoChip v2.0 software to assign a base to any position (N-call) can be for several reasons. failure was attributed to poor hybridization at regions with 4 sequential C bases and poor probe performance. three different resequencing microarrays were analysed using ResqMi. 'CFTR' (targeting the human CFTR gene), 'SARS' (for the Corona virus causing Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) and 'Mito' (which became the Affymetrix MitoChip v.1.0) this software succeeded in resolving up to 10% of the N-calls on all three array types using GSEQ as the primary software blood or bone marrow samples were from 7 patients with myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) and one patient with chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL), obtained from the australasian Leukaemia and Lymphoma Group Tissue Bank. low passage fibroblast cultures from 8 pediatric patients with metabolic disorders indicative of mitochondrial dysfunction were obtained from the Department of Pathology. the GSEQ MitoChip v2.0 microarray software assigns homoplasmic mutations (IUPAC codes A, C, G or T); heteroplasmic mutations (IUPAC codes R, Y, K, M, S, or W), or an N-Call where a base position cannot be assigned by the software. sPROFILER is a novel algorithm developed to improve GSEQ array call rates. mtDNA8 had the 3 longest N-call stretches from each of the 16 mtDNA samples. the longest stretch of N-calls of each sample was amplified using the appropriate primer for each N-cell stretch. mtDNA8 had the 3 longest N-call stretches sequenced. patient samples Total DNA was extracted from 16 patient samples. blood or bone marrow samples were from 7 patients with myelodyplastic syndrome (MDS) and one patient with chronic lymphoblastic leukemia (CLL) were obtained from the Department of Pathology, Mater Adult Hospital, Brisbane, Australia. sPROFILER is a novel algorithm developed to improve GSEQ array call rates. sPROFILER was not designed to query base calls conforming to reference sequence. sPROFILER is a base calling algorithm using intensity comparison. mtDNA8 had the 3 longest N-call stretches sequenced, while mtDNA7 from one fibroblast cell line sample was homozygous for the 94C. for sample mtDNA7, the entire sequence of the mitochondrial genome was amplified using 36 pairs of M13-tagged oligodeoxynucleotide primers. results table 1 shows mean of GSEQ N-calls across 16 samples. averaging 35% and 61% decreases respectively for the rCRS section. results are shown as average of N-call numbers and % decreases. Figure 1 shows re-analyses of the N-call stretches produced by GSEQ using sPROFILER (see: Additional file 1, Table S1) or ResqMi (see: Additional file 1, Table S2). approx. 2% of the remaining N-call stretches were 5 bases for both re-analyses. the two longest stretches from the GESEQ analysis remained following ResqMi or sPROFILER re-analyses. this suggested using the ResqMi may result in base miscalling, particularly increasing heteroplasmic calls. for sample mtDNA7, comparison of the re-analysis of the MitoChip sequence with complete conventional sequencing showed that all heteroplasmy calls produced by ResqMi in fact matched the rCRS as called by conventional sequencing. mtDNA4 5, 6, 11 4, 5 1 insertion (in 5 base stretch) mtDNA5 5, 13, 5 1 insertion (in 5 base stretch) mtDNA6 5, 7, 11 4, 5, 11 1 point mutation, 1 insertion (in 11 base stretch) mtDNA7 5, 10 4 Entire mtDNA sequenced: 1 point mutation (in 4 N-call stretch) conventional sequencing revealed 12 point mutations within the N-call stretches. mtDNA9 also had insertion type m.315insC located one base outside its stretch. 2 deletions were found to be CG-rich. -loop 464 A N A > N A > C N = New point mutation (1) D-loop 523-524 AC AC delAC Deletion (1) 16S rRNA 1814 A R A > G - Heteroplasmic mutation (2) 16S rRNA 3107 C - delC deletion MTND2 5264 C T C > T C > T New MTND4 11466 T K T > G - Heteroplasmic mutation (2) MTTL2 sPROFILER analysis for mtDNA7 revealed 4 of these N-call bases to be point mutations. one of these point mutations was found among the N-call stretches of 4 bases and the other 3 point mutations were found among single N-calls. the remaining 141 N-call bases matched the rCRS. sPROFILER or ReseqMi re-analyses of GSEQ N-calls has not been demonstrated previously. sPROFILER or ReseqMi software produced a larger number of N-call stretches compared to sPROFILER. this did not affect the homoplasmic or heteroplasmic mutation rates compared to sPROFILER. insertions had the highest negative impact on probe annealing. both of the longest N-call stretches (18 and 20 bases) contained point mutations. shorter N-calls may also hide sequence variants. conventional sequencing efforts on longer stretches of N-calls were better identified using sPROFILER than ResqMi software. this improved the base calling and reducing N-calls to those that frequently represented an undefined change. authors declare that they have no competing interests. deon Venter, dr David Cowley and dr Ivan McGown are thanks for their cooperation and encouragement. the Mater Children's Hospital Golden Casket Research Fund and the John P Kelly Research Fund provided generous support."}
