{"summary": "Alphaviruses are arboviruses, which means they utilize arthropods as a vector between host species [2] there are currently 31 distinctive members, which are unofficially categorized as either old world or new world depending on geographic identification. despite nearly 40 years of research, there are no licensed alphavirus vaccines or alphavirus specific antivirals. the nucleocapsid core (NC) is made up of 240 copies of the capsid protein (CP) and the genomic RNA. it is unclear whether the 11 kb single stranded RNA genome assumes a single specific structure within the NC. RNA appears to be required for the process since in vitro assembly of NC does not continue without some form of nucleic acid. the cross section is radially colored: center (red) to the outer surface (blue) the glycoprotein spikes (blue) are embedded in a lipid envelope (aqua to green) the NC is made up of CPs (green and yellow) and RNA (yellow and red) structural proteins are translated from a subgenomic 26S RNA as a separate polyprotein (p130) the CP of Sindbis virus (SINV) consists of 264 amino acids with a mass of approximately 30 kDa. the CP is automatically proteolytically cleaved, which releases it into the cytoplasm. a signal sequence allows the remainder of the structural polyprotein to be inserted into the ER. the dimerization domain of the yeast protein GCN4 was shown to be a functional substitute for helix 1 in SINV [36]. a smaller amino acid sequence (99\u2013114) at the C-terminus of region II is highly conserved among alphaviruses. in the crystal structure, the N-terminus (regions I and II) is disordered and unresolved. studies using VEEV have re-defined the N-terminal domain into four separate sub-domains called SD1\u20134. SD1 represents the N-terminal peptide of VEEV (amino acids 1\u201337) and SD2 (38\u201351), the location of a peptide similar to helix I in SINV. identification of the PS was first defined from the study of defective interfering (DI) RNAs. a region between nucleotides 746 and 1226 in the nsP1 coding region on the genomic 49S RNA of SINV was sufficient to allow a non-viral RNA to bind to the CP above the background level. a previously uncharacterized region of sequence conservation was identified in the nsP1 coding sequence between SINV, Venezuelan, Eastern, and Western equine encephalitis viruses (VEEV, EEEV and WEEV) this region from nucleotides 753\u20131116 corresponded to what previous reports had referred to as the PS. an in vitro model of NC assembly was created by wengler et al. in 1982. it was further developed by Tellinghuisen et al. in 1999. the resulting particles are termed core-like particles (CLPs) since they retain critical characteristics such as density, diameter, and overall morphology. nucleic acid binds nucleic acid and may initiate assembly. only limited truncation of this domain, up to 19 amino acids, was tolerated in the CLP experiments. dimers of CP are likely to initiate assembly. CHIKV virus-like particles(VLPs) have been generated from the heterologous expression of the structural proteins in both insect and mammalian cells. these particles have been used in a Phase 1 clinical trial as a vaccine for CHIKV owing to the fact that the particles resemble wt particles and therefore illicit a relevant immune response. similar mutations in SFV produced wt particles but prevented pre-formation of NCs in the cytoplasm. this study presented the first pieces of evidence that the very N-terminus of CP (SD1) also regulates specificity. a series of reversions occurred in the replication protein nsP2. this improved viral fitness and suggested that nsP2 may influence packaging. nsP2 was associated with mobile puncta that co-localized with nsP3 and the cellular stress factor G3BP. model would place the location of NC packaging and assembly at the replication complex. CP subdomains (SD1\u20134) in VEEV were deleted and introduced into BHK cells. SD1, 3, and 4 deleted viruses produced VLPs. this suggests that the location of RNA packaging was disrupted in these mutants. this could match a well described feature of alphavirus infection. cleavage sites in helical, non-icosahedral virus particles were produced. this data supports the notion that interactions between glycoproteins can influence the NC and may present a variation of the alternative pathway of simultaneous assembly at the PM. in vivo and in vitro studies have thus far concluded that NC assembly is not a reaction simply mediated by a CP-PS interaction. a spherule results when the replication complex of nsP1\u20134 begins to synthesize RNA. the subgenomic promoter is favored resulting in the structural polyprotein CP to E1. the protease activity of CP on its C-terminal domain cleaves it off nascent polyproteins co-translationally. MS2 and the plant virus were able to show that labelled RNA molecules had a larger hydrodynamic radius than the space available within the NCs. they go on to describe the second stage as the assembly stage in which further multimers of CP co-operatively follow the physical path laid out by the RNA to form fully assembled particles. this hypothesis shifts away from traditional capsid-centric based assembly ideas towards an RNA-centric one. model is based off evidence that multiple discrete PS exist on the genomes of viruses such as MS2, STNV, and HBV. stage 1 refers to the collapse of the RNA into a condensed form following inter-CP interactions. the alphavirus RNA has a wider ensemble of states within the NC compared to two stage virions. this is so that the RNA can maintain specific contacts with CPs. this is so that the RNA can maintain specific contacts with CPs, which are required for assembly to proceed along the pathway. a new two stage theory appears more valid in that multiple PSs achieve assembly by guiding the capsid protein down a specific RNA packaging pathway. the real answer may lie in some combination of the two theories and further investigation into alphavirus assembly may be a useful system to investigate this. many old and new theories rely heavily on the knowledge of at least one step between the first (monomer) and last (particle) species, information that is drastically lacking in the alphavirus literature. one of the major roadblocks in this regard has been the inability to track discreet CP states."}
