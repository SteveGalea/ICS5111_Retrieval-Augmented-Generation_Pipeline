{"summary": "retrospective cohort study includes patients who underwent transplantation between March 2004 and April 2014 at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. only an individual's first episode of HMPV infection was analyzed. the data about HMPV infection in the community were based on the University of Washington Molecular Virology Laboratory data. URI was defined as viral detection in a nasopharyngeal sample and new pulmonary infiltrates without bronchoscopic examination. patients diagnosed 2 days after URI diagnosis were considered to have progression to LRD. a copathogen was defined as a significant pathogen when detected in a concurrent respiratory sample or in a blood sample. patients' demographic data and transplantation information were retrieved from the FHCRC database. the data about the clinical course of HMPV infections in the community were based on the University of Washington Molecular Virology Laboratory data. patients diagnosed with LRD 2 days after URI diagnosis were considered to have progression to LRD. a copathogen was defined as a significant pathogen when detected in a concurrent respiratory sample or in a blood sample obtained within 2 days of diagnosis of HMPV infection. median time to HMPV detection after HCT was 278.5 days (range, 5 to 2773 days) median viral load in nasal wash samples was 1.1 106 copies/mL (range, 3.3 102\u20131.7 109 copies/mL) only 1 patient who did not have engraftment prior to death had LRD. at HCT, y.62 20 19 (16) 16 (18) 3 (10) 21\u201360 81 (69) 59 (67) 22 (73) >60 18 (15) 13 (15) 5 (17) Disease risk at HCT. standard 78 (66) 62 (70) 16 (53) High 40 (34) 26 (30) 14 (47) Transplantation year.011 2004\u20132009 58 (49) 37 (42) 21 (70) 2010\u20132014 60 (51) 51 (58) 9 (30) Transplantation copathogen.038 None 82 (69) 66 (75) 16 (53) Any pathogen 36 (31) 22 (25) 14 (47) %FEV1/FVC pre HMPV LRD.58 70 76 (78) 57 (80) 19 (73) 70 21 (22) 14 (20) 7 (27) %TLC pre HMPV LRD 1.00 80 77 (85) 55 (85) 22 (85) 80 14 (15) 10 (15) 4 (15) White blood cell count at diagnosis. the number of HMPV infections by month between July 2008 and June 2014 is shown in Figure 1A. most of the infections were identified between December and May of each calendar year. most of the infections were identified between December and May of each calendar year. in total, among 105 patients with URI, the probability of progression to LRD within 40 days was 16% (Figure 2).

Approximately 75% (14/17) of the patients who progressed to LRD did so within 2 weeks after URI. all variables in Table 1 were used for the univariable analysis. only variables with P.1 are shown in this table. factors associated with the development of LRD were early onset of HMPV infection after HCT (odds ratio [OR], 3.70; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.33\u201311.1; P =.010) factors associated with the development of LRD were early onset of HMPV infection after HCT. only 2 patients who died before day 100 had prolonged shedding. steroid use of 1 mg/kg was associated with longer shedding. there was no evidence of a correlation between disease status and viral load in nasal wash samples at presentation. we identified steroid use of 1 mg/kg before diagnosis, low lymphocyte count, and onset of HMPV infection during the first month after HCT as important risk factors for progression. 60% of patients with steroid use of 1 mg/kg or with low lymphocyte count had progression. the logistic regression model provided additional insights. a larger study, however, showed no protective effect of ribavirin for HMPV LRD [10]. a maintenance dose of IVIG was not associated with a lower progression rate. we were unable to analyze the effect of ribavirin or high-dose IVIG because the number of patients who received it before progression was low. virological workup of upper and lower respiratory tract samples was too small. we performed several different bivariate Cox models. low lymphocyte count or steroid dose before diagnosis are important factors for progression to LRD. further studies are needed to define the role of viral load in pathogenesis."}
