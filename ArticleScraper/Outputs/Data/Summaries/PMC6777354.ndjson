{"summary": "human norovirus (HuNoV) is a major causative pathogen of acute viral gastroenteritis. it is most prevalent during autumn and winter in the northern hemisphere. the virus can be detected throughout the year (Kirk et al., 2015). the genomes of noroviruses contain three open reading frames and encodes six non-structural proteins. the genomes contain three open reading frames and encodes six non-structural proteins, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and the two capsid proteins VP1 and VP2. next-generation sequencing technologies are useful for the comprehensive analysis of various virus genomes. RNA was extracted from 10% suspensions of fecal samples in phosphate buffered saline using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit. the extracted RNA was subjected to sequencing as described below. cleotide sequences of the VP1 and RdRp regions were acquired using the primer walking method. data analysis was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench v8.0.1 (Qiagen) es (20 strains), as well as an outgroup strain of HuNoV GI genotype (GI.P1), were appended to produce an RdRp dataset consisting of 156 strains (Table S1). the constructed datasets were aligned with MAFFT software (Katoh and Standley, 2013). best substitution models (GTR++I for both VP1 and RdRp) were determined for the constructed datasets (365 strains for VP1 and 156 strains the evolutionary rates of GII.P17-GII.17 strains were calculated as described above. the analyzed parameters with substitution, clock, and tree prior models are shown in Table 1. the MCMC was run on chain lengths of 480,000,000 steps. three crystal structures for VP1 (PDBID: 1IHM, 5F4M and 5LKC) and one for RdRp (PDBID: 1SH0) were used as the templates based on basic local alignment search tool5 analysis of the proteins. regions of 96.1% 0.26 (VP1) and 98.0% 0.46 (RdRp), the allowed regions of 3.43% 0.32 (VP1) and 1.47% 0.32 (RdRp) and the outlier regions of 0.47% 0.058 (VP1) and 0.57% 0.15 (RdRp) were determined to be conformational epitopes. MEME is used to detect positive selection sites under a proportion of branches. significance levels were set at posterior probabilities of >0.9 for FUBAR and p 0.05 for MEME. RNA was extracted from 10% suspensions of fecal samples in phosphate buffered saline using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) the extracted RNA was subjected to sequencing as described below. the DNA sequences were analyzed using a 3500 Genetic Analyser. full-length nucleotide sequences of the VP1 and RdRp regions were acquired using the primer walking method. data analysis was performed using CLC Genomics Workbench v8.0.1. the representative RdRp sequences of the GII genotypes, including porcine NoV (GII.P11 and GII.P18) and other HuNoV GII genotypes (20 strains) were appended to produce an RdRp dataset consisting of 156 strains. the constructed datasets were aligned with MAFFT software. maximum clade credibility trees were generated by discarding the first 10% of trees (burn-in) using TreeAnnotator v2.4.8 in the BEAST2 package. the time-scaled phylogenetic trees were visualized by FigTree4 v1.4.0 software. branch reliability was supported by highest posterior densities (HPDs) of 95%. Phylogenetic distances Phylogenetic trees were created using the maximum likelihood method in MEGA7 software. best substitution models (GTR++I for VP1 and K80+ for RdRp) were selected using the jModelTest2. favored regions of 96.1% 0.26 (VP1) and 98.0% 0.46 (RdRp), allowed regions of 3.43% 0.32 (VP1) and 1.47% 0.32 (RdRp) and outlier regions of 0.47% 0.058 (VP1) and 0.57% 0.15 (mean SD) of all residues in each structure were determined to be conformational epitopes. MEME is used to detect positive selection sites under a proportion of branches. significance levels were set at posterior probabilities of >0.9 for FUBAR and p 0.05 for MEME. GII.P17-GII.17 Strains We constructed time-scaled phylogenetic trees using the MCMC method based on the full-length of the VP1 and RdRp regions in the GII.17 strains detected in the various countries. the MCMC tree for the VP1 region estimated that the common ancestor of the GII.17, GII.13, and GII.21 diverged in September, 1931 (95% ancestor of the GII.P17 diverged in January, 1988 (95% HPD December, 1980\u2013May, 1993) and then further into two clusters by around August, 2012. the GII.P17-GII.17 strains were contained in clusters 1 and 2 in the RdRp region, which was compatible with the classification in the VP1 region. phylogenetic distances between nucleotide sequences of GII.17 strains in full-length VP1 and RdRp regions. y-axis shows number of sequence pairs corresponding to each distance. x-axis represents phylogenetic distances. the y-axis represents the effective population sizes on a logarithmic scale. the x-axis denotes time in years. the solid black line indicates the mean posterior value. aa342 and aa376 were at predicted epitopes. GII.P17-GII.17 could evolve with changes in antigenicity and binding affinity to HBGAs.

V......... a total of 48 amino acid substitutions were identified among the GII.P17 and GII.P4 strains. a total of 16 amino acid substitutions were estimated among the GII.P17 and GII.P3 strains. substitutions at aa49, aa215, aa407, and aa409 were located proximal to the active site. for intra-GII.P17 genotype, substitutions at aa206, aa215, aa407, and Lys405Arg were found around the active site in the strains of cluster 2 (12 strains) transmission network between the GII.P17-GII.17 Strains Links in circulation of prevalent GII.P17-GII.17 (cluster 1) was analyzed using a median joining network. strains belonging to cluster 1 were mainly found from Japan, while those belonging to clusters 2 and 3 were found in various countries including china, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and australia. a common ancestor of the GII.17 strains diverged in September, 1931 (95% HPD January, 1911\u2013February, 1950) of these strains, the GII.P17-GII.17 strains belonged to clusters 1 and 2 (Figure 1). GII.P17-GII.17 strains in clusters 3, 4, 5, and 6 (no information on the RdRp sequence in cluster 7) were composed of the distinct RdRp genotypes GII.P17-GII.17 strains were contained in clusters 1 and 2 in the RdRp region. most strains of the GII.P17-GII.17 also belonged to cluster 1. the common ancestor of cluster 1 diverged in august, 2012. the y-axis shows the number of sequence pairs corresponding to each distance while the x-axis represents phylogenetic distances. evolutionary rates of the VP1 and RdRp regions of the GII.P17-GII.17 strains are presented in Table 1.

(2017). $ Red indicates conformational epitopes predicted in this study. a total of 48 amino acid substitutions were identified among the GII.P17 and GII.P4 strains. three substitutions were found around the active site in the strains of cluster 2 (12 strains) and a Ser427Asn substitution was located proximally at the interface between monomers. the strains analyzed were divided into four clusters. s belonging to cluster 1 were found from Japan, while those belonging to clusters 2 and 3 were found in various countries including Japan, China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Australia. the network contained the key strains that were linked to the many other strains. these results suggest that the GII.P17-GII.17 strains form a broad network. previous reports have also suggested a gap in the divergence of GII.P16-GII.2 strains. previous reports have also suggested a gap in the divergence of GII.P16-GII.2 strains. however, the evolutionary rates for the overall cluster in GII.P17-GII.17 were similar. GII.P17 is likely similar to that for GII.2 in the VP1 region, but lower than that of GII.P4. previous reports have suggested that GII.P4-GII.4 virus prevalence is associated with the rapid evolution of the VP1 regions with a high ratio of non-synonymous amino acids to synonymous substitutions. additional in vitro studies may be needed to address these possibilities. we also assessed the phylodynamics of GII.P17-GII.17 and found that the genome population sizes of GII.P17-GII.17 increased rapidly during 2014\u20132015 and then decreased rapidly thereafter. these fluctuations may be associated with epidemics of the newly emerged HuNoV and the acquisition of herd immunity. some amino acid substitutions are located adjacent to the HBGA binding sites. this results in changes in the antigenicity of the GII.17 capsid protein. previous reports have suggested that aa375 and aa377 are associated with the HBGA binding capability. onine residue at aa33 is phosphorylated by a host factor, Akt. this residue is located around the interface between monomers in the RdRp structure. the GII.P4 protein contains a threonine residue at the position, while that of GII.P17 contains an asparagine. this may suggest that the enzyme activity of RdRp differs between the GII.P4 and GII.P17 genotypes this virus may have the potential to alter its antigenicity, host-binding capability (i.e., HBGA) and genome replication efficiency. such changes could recurrently generate variants of GII.17 with the potential to produce pandemics such as those caused by GII.4 variant strains.
