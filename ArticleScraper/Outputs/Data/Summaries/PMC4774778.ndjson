{"summary": "aliquots titer 108 TCID50 (3 for each strain) exposed to 37, 57, and 77\u00b0C for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 65 min. aliquots titer 108 TCID50 (3 for each strain) exposed to 37, 57, and 77\u00b0C for 15, 30, 45, 60, and 65 min. FMDV (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) were inactivated when exposed to heat 57\u00b0C for 15 min. UV inactivation of FMDV (O/pan Asia and SAT-2) was obtained within 60 min and 65 min for type A/Iran05. crease in milk production, weight gain, reproductive inefficiencies, and death in young ruminants are the main economic losses caused by FMD. inactivation can be performed using chemical or physical methods or a combination of the two. a wide range of well-established and novel inactivation methods have been described to successfully inactivate viruses for vaccine purposes. there are limited studies on UV inactivation of FMD virus (FMDV) using irradiation. the present study was designed to investigate the effects of heat, -radiation, and UV on foot and mouth virus strains (O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012) inactivation. the titer was expressed as log10 TCID50 as described by Reed and Muench. it was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 days and compared with the control non-infected cells. the virus suspension degrees were distributed in nine tubes of 3 ml capacity for each strain, each containing 2 ml of virus suspension. the tubes were exposed to 37, 57, and 77\u00b0C, individually. each tube was collected after 15, 30, 45, 60, and 65 min intervals. inactivation in a final concentration of 2% (up to 24 h), also sodium bisulfite 20% was added after inactivation to neutralize the rest of formaldehyde. safety test In cell culture Infectivity of inactivated viruses with different inactivator was studied by cell culture methods. all samples were inoculated on BHK21 cell lines for three passages. two wells were used as a control, the first received 25 l of antigen, 25 l of complement and 25 l of veronal buffer. the 2nd one received 25 l of antigen and 50 l of veronal buffer. SNT The test was performed by the microtechnique as described by Ferreira [35] to estimate antibodies against FMD in sera. in flat bottom tissue culture microtiter plates, two-fold serially diluted sera in Modified Eagle\u2019s medium were used. the plate was incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and washed with washing buffer at least 5 times. an amount of 50 l of each dilution was placed in a vertical column of the wells in a flat-bottomed microplate. serial two-fold dilution of positive (+ve) and negative control sera were made using PBS with 1% bovine albumin as a diluting buffer. the first vertical two rows were left as blank. 100 l per well of strong +ve serum dilutions were transferred horizontally to rows numbers (3,4), (5,6), (7,8), (9,10), and (11,12) that correspond to antigen dilutions 1/10, 1/20, 1/40 up to ELISA plates were coated with the FMD antigen by adding 100 l of 1/140 diluted antigen in carbonate-bicarbonate buffer in the 96 flat-bottomed wells. the plate was then incubated at 4\u00b0C overnight, after that the contents were decanted, the plate was washed and dried as before. each serum sample was run in duplicates, including the control positive (strong and weak positive sera) and negative sera. results may be 1.0 or more than 1.0 or more than 1.0 or 1.0. results may be positive, 1.0 means negative, cut off of FMD. Sodium hydroxide (Analar) NaOH (molecular weight = 40) It was obtained from Aldrich Chemical Company Limited Gillinham, Dorest, U.K. It was used in concentration of 0.2 normality for dissolving (BEA) in cyclization process according to Bahneman [25]. Formaldehyde 40% It was obtained from BDH Chemicals Likited Poole, U.K. the virus suspension degrees were distributed in nine tubes of 3 ml capacity for each strain. the tubes were exposed to 37, 57, and 77\u00b0C, individually. all samples of each tube were collected after 15, 30, and 45 min intervals. inactivated viruses were inoculated into suckling mice to confirm complete inactivation of the FMDV. reading was recorded until the 5th day post-inoculation. a set of 4 wells were inoculated on BHK cells and control non-infected cells were inoculated with 25 l of Hank\u2019s solution then the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 days. the titer was expressed as log10 TCID50. formaldehyde 40% It was obtained from BDH Chemicals Likited Poole, U.K. It\u2019s molecular weight was 30.03, It was used in a concentration 0.04% in inactivation process according to Farid et al. [31]. Sodium bisulfite (Na2S2O5) It was prepared as 20% solution, sterilized by autoclaving, and used in a final concentration of 2%. irradiation was done at 0-4\u00b0C by some artificial ices. virus suspension was dispersed in sterilized petri-dishes. a virus sample was collected at 15, 30, 45, 60, and 65 min intervals. complement fixation test (CFT) was done according to health protection agency. it was necessary to titrate the complement to know the minimum hemolytic dose which will give 100% hemolysis. further dilutions were made to give a dilutions corresponding to 0.5%, 1%, 1.5%, and up to 6%. a positive reaction is shown when there is no hemolysis in the wells. each dose (3 ml) of vaccine contains not less 108 TCID50/dose and 2.2 g antigen pay loaded of each virus type. ilution which protected 50% of wells was calculated by Reed and Muench [30]. the plates were washed with distilled water for at least 5 times and left for 30 min to dry in the incubator. 80% CPE was observed in each of infected cells. the plate was covered and placed on a shaker at a dark place. the reaction was stopped by adding 25 l of sulphoric acid (1.25 mol) to each well. the titer of the conjugate was 1/20,000. the last horizontal row received 100 l per well from H3 up to H12 as negative control serum. the plate was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h then decanted, washed, and dried as before. 100 l of the diluted conjugate solution (previously titrated) were added to each well. coated plate, 90 l were added then 10 l of the tested serum were added to the first well to make a final dilution 1/10. each serum sample was run in duplicates including the control positive (strong and weak positive sera) and negative sera. the inactivated vaccines in calves were divided into six groups. five groups were inoculated by the inactivated prepared vaccines. one group was kept as a control without vaccination. ISA antigen FMDV type O/pan Asia, A/Iran05, and SAT-2/2012 were propagated in clone 13-cell culture. when 80% CPE was observed, each of infected cell cultures was frozen and thawed three times to release FMDV extracellular. the titer of the conjugate was coated with 100 l of coating buffer for each well. antigen titeration The antigen is titrated to determine the optimum concentration of the antigen to be used in the assay. serial dilutions of the FMD antigen as 1/10, 1/20, up to 1/200 were made using the coating buffer solution. 100 l from each dilution were transferred to two successive horizontal column plates. the plate was covered and shaked on a shaker at slow speed for 15 min. the reaction was stopped by adding 25 l of the stopping solution 1.25 mol (sulphoric acid) to each well. the plate was then read using ELISA reader at wavelength 492 nm. the highest dilution of virus antigen gave 1.9 OD. the content of the plate was decanted and washed 3 times with the washing buffer solution. the plate was covered and incubated in the dark place for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. a brownish coloration indicating positive reaction was developed. inactivated, (+)=means that the virus was not inactivated, FMDV=Foot and mouth disease virus, UV=Ultraviolet, CPE=Cytopathic changes The virus suspension exposed to heat treatment at 37\u00b0C was not inactivated after 15, 30, and 45 min of exposure. complete inactivation was done after exposure to temperature 57\u00b0C for 15 min, and each of the virus samples showed CPE on the BHK-21 cell line. inactivation kinetics of foot and mouth disease virus type SAT-2/2012 either binary ethyleneimine (BEI) only or BEI-FA at 37\u00b0C.
