{"summary": "behavior-influenza model was used to estimate spread rate of age-specific risk perception in response to an influenza outbreak. age-specific overlapping percentage was estimated to be 40%\u201343%, 55%\u201360%, and 19%\u201335% for child, teenage and adult age groups. risk perception can be referred to as an awareness or belief about the potential hazard and/or harm. social factors such as media release by health authorities, observation or interaction with relation-specific groups, past experiences of similar hazards, habits, and culture influence risk perception. the effects of risk perception on behavioral change and susceptibility reduction were studied extensively. they indicated that the effects within a disease network can induce health behavioral changes in the population. this could result in a feedback signal to alter the progress of the disease dynamics. influenza season was defined from July 1 (week 26) to June 30 (week 25) of the following year in Taiwan. the ILI-related emergency admission rates were detected by using the ICD-9-CM codes for influenza and pneumonia (480\u2013487) 104 (1.0 104)a 8.4 103 (1.7 103)a R0,PRIb Basic reproduction number resulting from individual with the risk perception informationc LN (1.78, 1.08) LN (1.14, 1.04) LN (1.00, 1.01) b Perception spread ratec LN (2.72, 1.20) LN (1.37, 1.28) LN (1.12, 1.32) b Recovery rate of infected becoming perceptive 1d I Reduced infectiousness v,pre ORs of perceived severity with regard to adopting protective behavior N (1.68, 0.45) ORBar,pre ORs of perceived barrier with regard to adopting protective behavior N (4.34, 1.5) Immunity loss rate of recovered without perception 1c Recovery rate of infected with perception 2c Notes: a Mean (SD). b LN distribution with a gm and a gsd. c Estimated from this study. R0,RPI can be estimated as:19 R 0, RPI, i j = ( ln ( 1 IF i j ) 1.63 ) 1.66. to better characterize perception spread rate, we adopted ij from an epidemic equilibrium structure. we used an information theoretic model referred to as the multiple access channel (MAC) that is used to capture a signal R0 transmitting through multiple channels to the responses I1, I2,..., In. we considered the network-driven risk perception information model (NM) with information bottleneck (IB) we estimated the based on the relationship between viral titer-based I and viral tier-based R0 corresponding to with/without perceived different health behaviors. two protective behaviors (i.e., perceived of carrying the disease to vaccine and antiviral taking) were adopted in a state of greater alert. n e represents individuals perceived with/without health behaviors. we incorporated the estimated probability distribution of the model parameter with age-specific initial population sizes in the period of 2007\u20132013. s is represented as a function of measured states, which are based on the HBM by using the standard logistic regression-based equation. s can be rewritten as;26 s = OR 0 ( OR Sus ) x Sus ( OR Sev ) x Ben ( OR Bar ) x Bar, (8) where s is the probability of the HBM-based health behaviors (such as preventive behavior, s,pre, and protective behavior, s,pro) infection risk in a susceptible population at specific R0 signal, P(R0) is the probability distribution of R0 signal (the prior probability), and P(I|R0) is the conditional response distribution describing the dose\u2013response relationship between I and R0. the interdependences between belief of risk perception and infection risk can then be expressed as a mechanism of interpersonal influence described in Equation 10. influenza season was defined from July 1 (week 26) to June 30 (week 25) of the following year in Taiwan. we estimated the age-specific admission infection fraction (IF) for each age group, including child (0\u201314 years), teenage and adult (15\u201364 years), and elderly (65+ years) perception spread ratec LN (2.72, 1.20) LN (1.37, 1.28) LN (1.12, 1.32) b Perception loss ratec LN (0.42, 1.45) LN (0.26, 2.27) b Recovery rate of infected becoming perceptive 1d I Reduced infectiousness factor as infected individuals carry perceptual disease andvoluntarily reduce contact number 0\u20131d S,pree Reduced susceptibility factor with regard to adopting preventive b LN distribution with a gm and a gsd. c Estimated from this study. basic reproduction number (R0) can be used to quantify disease infection severity, defined as the average number of secondary cases produced successfully by an infected individual. the equilibrium information flow of risk perception from population without perception can be expressed as;12 R 0 e d = 1 + ( 1 I ) [ R 0 e a ( 1 + + w / o ) 1 ] 1 + I [ R 0 e a ( 1 + + w / o ) 1 ], (3) where R 0 e a is the basic reproduction number at equilibrium with information flow of risk perception from population without perception, is the rate of in network-based information model to assess the effect of network-driven risk perception information transmission on influenza infection. we applied an information theoretic model referred to as the multiple access channel (MAC) that is used to capture a signal R0 transmitting through multiple channels to the responses I1, I2,..., In. we considered the network-driven risk perception information model (NM) with information bottleneck (IB) the value of can be used to associate the amount of observed variability that is attributable to the overall biological variability and experimental noise. IO describes the age-specific overlapping percentage between the infected population with/without perception adjusted by the fractions of initial infected population with perceptual state. s can be expressed in terms of odds ratios (ORs) depending on health behaviors perceived to be associated with each HBM variable. s can be regarded as a predictor of behavior decision on. s can be rewritten as;26 s = OR 0 ( OR Sus ) x Sus ( OR Sev ) x Ben ( OR Bar ) x Bar 1 + OR 0 ( OR Sus ) x Sus ( OR Sev ) x Ben ( OR Bar ) x Bar, (8) where s is the probability of the HBM-based health behaviors (such as preventive behavior, s,pre, and protective behavior, s,pro) the relationship between I and R0 can be obtained by 1 R(I) in Equation 9. the mutual information in R0I risk perception model can be written as;18 MI ( I ; R 0 ) = I, R 0 P ( I, R 0 ) log 2 P ( I | R 0 ) P ( I ) = I, R 0 R ( I ) log 2 ( 1 exp ( 1.63 1.66 R 0 ) P ( I ) = I, highest ILI-related emergency admission IF was in the child age group (0.7 0.1%), followed by teenage and adult (0.2 0.1%) and elderly (>65 years), in Taiwan. I+/I > 1 results in the lowest estimates of IO in child and elderly age groups. the estimate was the highest in the case of I+/I = 1. IO estimates range from 40% to 43%, 55% to 60%, and 19% to 35% for child, teenage and adult, and elderly age groups respectively. MImax ranged from 0.4 to 1.2 bits, 0.5 to 1.4 bits, and 1.2 to 2.4 bits for child, teenage and adult, and elderly age groups, respectively, given ne ranging from 1 to 6. the results indicated that individuals perceived the health behaviors to increase MImax among child, and teenage and adult age groups. the age-specific MI with respect to with/without health behaviors was estimated based on Equations 7 and 10. median percentages of decrease in infection risk with MIs = 1 and 2 for elderly were 30 (1.5\u201383) and 57 (5.1\u201397), respectively. the child age group had the lowest estimates of 5 (0.3\u201314) and 7 (0.3\u201379), respectively. 2.8 104 1.1 104, and 8.4 103 1.7 103 per month for child, teenage and adult, and elderly age groups. the ILI-related emergency admission rates were estimated to be 16.8 7.3 (mean SD), 1.2 0.8, and 3.5 1.3 per 10,000 population for child, teenage and adult, and elderly age groups. lognormal distribution with a geometric mean (gm) and a geometric standard deviation (gsd), LN (gm, gsd), was the most suitable fitted model for R0,PRI distributions of LN (1.78, 1.08), LN (1.14, 1.04), and LN (1.00, 1.01) for child, teenage and adult, age groups. we used three different scenarios of initial infected population fraction. the individual with risk perceptual status is more likely to have the communicable belief among the population. when I+/I 1 and I+/I = 1, the MImax was 1 bit, indicating that the network-based information reflected cooperativity. the results indicated that MImax ranged from 0.9 to 1.9 bits, 1.0 to. for the teenage and adult age group, MImax ranged from 1.1 to 1.5 bits, 0.8 to 1.9 bits, and 3.5 to 4.8 bits for without control, and preventive, and protective behaviors, respectively. individuals perceived the health behaviors to increase MImax among child, and teenage and adult age groups. infection risk with MIs = 1 and 2 for elderly were 30 (1.5\u201383) and 57 (5.1\u201397), respectively, whereas the child age group had the lowest estimates of 5 (0.3\u201314) and 7 (0.3\u201379), respectively. age-specific percentage of decrease in infection risk depending on (A) without control behavior, (B) preventive behavior, and (C) protective behavior. the HBM was used to examine individual\u2019s perceptual dimensions such as perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers. however, the HBM has led to somewhat controversial issues in exploring the health behaviors such as for vaccination programs. a further limitation of our study is that we did not consider the influential factors on risk perception in an epidemic model. risk communication might be more effective if health authorities focus on a variety of information communication channels for conveying health behavior messages. % of volunteers infected A(H1N1) Texas/1/85a 4.5 8/7 86 Sears et al1 4.5 9/8 89 5.5 18/12 67 Taxas/36/91b 6 16/14 88 Hayden et al2,c 6 16/14 88 6 64/54 84 Gubareva et al3,c 5.9 18/15 83 Barroso et al4,d 5.9 18/16 89 5.9 18/16 d Peramivir (intranasal), e Ribavir (oral), f Amantadine (capsule), g Zanamivir (intranasal), TCID50, the 50% cell culture infectious dose. comparison of live, attenuated H1N1 and H3N2 cold-adapted and avian-human influenza A reassortant viruses. double-blind evaluation of oral ribavirin (Virazole) in experimental influenza A virus infection in volunteers. antimicrob agents Chemother. 1977;12(4):498\u2013502. neuraminidase inhibitor zanamivir in experimental human influenza. zanamivir is a neuraminidase inhibitor in human experimental influenza."}
