{"summary": "in 2009, the Korean guideline for RSV prophylaxis had established up to five shots monthly per RSV season, only for children 1 year of age with hemodynamic significance CHD (HS-CHD) infants received an average of 3.71.9 (range, 1-10) injections during the RSV season. the risk of severe RSV infection with significant morbidity and mortality is greatest in infants less than 6 months old. the risk of severe RSV infection with significant morbidity and mortality is greatest in premature infants, infants with chronic lung disease, immune deficiency. a total of 466 children with CHD received 1-5 injections of palivizumab (15 mg/kg) by intramuscular injection every 30 days, over one RSV season (October to February) HS-CHD was defined as. information collected for each patient included date of birth, age at first dose, follow up period, gender, structural type of CHD, and number of palivizumab injections received before and after RSV infection. underlying diagnoses of chromosomal defects, prematurity and low birth weight and status of cardiovascular surgery undergone, that involved cardiopulmonary bypass, were reviewed. the mean age of patients at the start of prophylaxis was 2.92.8 months (range, 0-11.2 months), and the mean follow-up period was 24.316.4 months. the main indication for RSV prophylaxis in this study was moderate to severe pulmonary hypertension (n=213; 45.7%), followed by cyanotic heart disease (n=196; 42.1%) and CHF requiring medication (n=115; 24.7%). only 146 patients (31%) received more than five injections. the majority (n=320; 69%) received less than four injections. the majority (n=320; 69%) received less than four injections. 50-seven patients (12.2%) were hospitalized with breakthrough RSV bronchiolitis after prophylaxis. the mean age of these patients was 7.95.7 months (range, 1.6-23.8) most (86%) experienced frequent RSV infections between October and the following January. 4th of the patients (24.6%) required admission to the ICU. 8 patients (14%) needed supplemental oxygen. 5 patients (8.8%) needed mechanical ventilation. 3 patients were hospitalized twice, once before and once after the 1-year-old check-up. heart diseases Number of patients (%) Number of RSV positive (%) Total deaths Deaths related to RSV Average number of palivizumab injections Systemic-pulmonary shunt defects (AVSD, ASD, VSD) 176 (37.7) 24 (13.6) 7 3 2.51 Tetralogy of Fallot 114 (24.4) 13 (11.4) 6 1 3.37 Univentricular heart 59 (12.7) 6 (10.2) 9 - 3.63 Left side outflow obstructions (AS, CoA, one-third of children (n=176; 37.7%) were classified as having shunt lesions with pulmonary hypertension. there were 7 in-hospital deaths of patients with shunt lesions, 3 of which were related to RSV infection. SV season has been proven to reduce the rate of hospitalizations by half (5%), according to biweekly reports from the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. the seasonal outbreaks of RSV infection occur during the winter months, namely September through March. on an average, nearly half will experience two episodes of infection. the majority (69%) of patients in this study received less than four injections. however, the majority (69%) received less than four injections. factors involved in effective prophylactic treatment include ensuring that treatment is initiated at the right time. a recent systematic review of cost-effectiveness of palivizumab prophylaxis compared with no prophylaxis in infants and young children with CHD showed a favorable trend, but were not addressed in this study. the current data on palivizumab prophylaxis has been collected for infants with CHD in Korea. children up to 24 months of age with HS-CHD, including cardiomyopathy, and postoperative CHD patients. the risk of hospitalization due to RSV infection remains high among children with CHD, cardiomyopathy, and postoperative CHD patients."}
