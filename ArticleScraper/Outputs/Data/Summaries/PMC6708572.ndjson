MERS-CoV replicates efficiently in various in vitro and ex vivo models. most at-risk groups are healthcare workers including nurses. MERS-CoV is reported in the dromedary camels in many african countries. no primary human cases have been reported in these countries. this may be related to some variation in the circulating Asian and African strains of MERS-CoV. several MERS-CoV travel-associated infections were in many cases associated with the Middle East. one Korean citizen visited some countries in the Middle East and returned home ill. this resulted in the largest MERS-CoV human outbreak outside the Arabian Peninsula (AP) camels do not show any pathognomonic signs despite a subtle fever and mild nasal discharge for up to 6 days post-infection (dpi) shedding of the infectious virus was reported in the experimentally infected camels started at 2 dpi up to the 7th dpi (Adney et al., 2014). more recently, one longitudinal study reported the possibility of MERS-CoV infection in seropositive animals. this raises concern about the role of the antibodies in the protection of the MERS-CoV infection. this raises concerns about the role of the antibodies in the protection of the MERS-CoV infection. experimental MERS-CoV infection in both alpacas and llamas showed a similar pattern to that of dromedary camels. however, the experimental infection of pigs with MERS-CoV did not reveal as much infection as that reported in alpacas and llamas. this species of bat is not the most relevant for MERS-CoV infection. an interesting study tested the potential roles of other species in the transmission of MERS-CoV such as cattle, sheep, goats, donkeys, buffaloes, mules, and horses. a new study reported the seropositivity of some sheep and goat to MERS-CoV from Tunisia, Senegal and Egypt. the same study reported the detection of the viral RNAs in samples from cow, sheep, goat and donkeys from Egypt. this highlights the importance of continuous surveillance and searching for new reservoir/s for the transmission cycle. a study connected the infection of some people to the drinking of the milk from one infected camel. however, another study was conducted in Qatar to assess the possibility of acquiring the infection from contaminated teats and udders of infected she-camels during the process of milking. this study reported the presence of specific MERS-CoV antibodies in approximately 3% of the workers in some slaughterhouses in Qatar. on the other hand, some studies reported the absence of any detectable antibodies in the sera of some herdsmen, veterinarians, and slaughterhouses in Saudi Arabia. the exact mechanism of transmission of MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans has not been ruled out. however, there may be a missing link in the chain of the human/camel interaction. the potential role of most camel secretions and excretions has not been fully understood. the genetic susceptibility of certain human populations is not clear in the context of MERS-CoV infection. there are several levels of human exposure to dromedary camels. there is an urgent need to develop a risk scoring system for human exposure to the dromedary camels. MERS-CoV infection in humans ranges from very severe cases of pneumonia to death. asymptomatic individuals, however, are unlikely to transmit the virus. there might be an unknown reservoir in the transmission cycle of the virus. the lack of active surveillance programs for respiratory viruses, especially coronaviruses, may result in many subclinical or mild cases of MERS-CoV being missed in a certain population. this may favor the sustainability of MERS-CoV in certain regions. vaccination of dromedary camels will have a great impact on the reduction of the viral shedding from these animals to the surrounding community. there has been progress in the current understanding of viral tropism, pathogenesis, and mode of transmission in the past five years. new strategies have been adopted to reduce the spread of infection in health care units. dromedary camel calves should be vaccinated during their first 6 months of life. vaccination of young dromedary camel calves should occur during their first 6 months of life. reorganization and reshaping of camel industry includes allocating camel markets away from cities. author declares there are no competing interests. author conceived and designed the experiments, performed the experiments, analyzed the data, contributed reagents/materials/analysis tools."}
