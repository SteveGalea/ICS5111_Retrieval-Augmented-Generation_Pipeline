{"summary": "climate change predictions are both scientifically and politically daunting lessens neither their verity nor implied imperative (7, 8) climate change will involve an average increase in global temperatures of approximately 1.1\u20136.4\u00b0C by the end of the century. world health organization estimated that in 2000, climate change caused approximately 150,000 excess deaths worldwide, as well as 5 million disability-adjusted life years (19). temperature and weather have direct effects on mortality and morbidity through the occurrence of extreme weather events, including heatwaves, cold periods, storms, floods, and droughts (11, 23\u201325). such events can affect the incidence of food-borne and water-borne disease (26, 27). the distribution of some infectious disease vectors Medium confidence Alter the seasonal distribution of some allergenic pollen species High confidence Increase heatwave-related deaths High confidence Continued changes in the range of some infectious disease vectors High confidence Mixed effects on malaria incidence and distribution High confidence Increase in cardio-respiratory morbidity and morality associated with ground-level ozone High confidence Increase in the number of people at risk of dengue Low confidence Health benefits include fewer deaths due to cold. 0.5 degree per decade, up to 5\u00b0C over the next century (42) effects of climate change in Canada will differ between regions (42). the Prairies are expected to experience warmer, drier summers and more sever summer droughts. Ontario and Quebec can expect decreased snow, increased rainfall, and an increase in the incidence of severe summer storms. prolonged drought followed by a high rainfall event can pick up surface contaminants and flush them into local waterways. higher than normal rainfall events may exceed expected norms for sewage treatment facilities, overwhelming treatment systems. the distribution of vector-borne diseases will change (40, 41, 63\u201365) changing sea temperatures are likely to impact distribution and availability of fish and tree species through impacts on local weather, affecting viability or focus of fisheries and forestry industries, and by extension the community health and well-being of resource-dependent communities. dramatic spread of the pine beetle has been facilitated \u2013 and many suggest triggered by increasingly favourable weather conditions. social status Social support networks Economic income Employment Working conditions Environmental Air quality & air pollution Drinking water quality Recreational water quality Water availability Food safety & inspection Regional parks Environmental planning & impact analysis Infrastructure and local works Housing Indoor air quality Vector-control Land use planning & urban development Water distribution, recycling & disposal Sewage treatment & inspection Transport Public transportation Transportation systems and road works Emergency response RESPONSES. despite the magnitude and scope of climate change, the recent global financial crisis has overshadowed concern for climate change science, policy, and action. despite the magnitude and scope of climate change, the recent global financial crisis has overshadowed concern for, and prioritization of, climate change science, policy, and action. commissioned in the united kingdom, estimated that a 5\u20136 \u00b0C warming over the next century could result in losses of up to 20% of global GDP. the health sector, which makes up 10% of Canada\u2019s Gross National Product (GNP), can make a significant contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation in Canada (102, 103)."}
