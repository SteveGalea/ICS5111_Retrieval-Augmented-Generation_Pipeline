{"summary": "excess immunity is associated with auto-immune diseases (for example, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes, psoriasis, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), inflammation (sepsis, inflammatory bowel disease) and allergy, as well as cell and organ rejection. deficient immunity is linked to cancer or susceptibility to infection. the main blood leukocyte populations circulating in the blood are represented in this figure. each cell type has a specialized function. innate immune effectors play a key role in defense against pathogens. the number of high-throughput molecular and cellular profiling tools that can be used to profile the human immune system is increasing rapidly. the number of high-throughput molecular and cellular profiling tools that can be used to profile the human immune system is increasing rapidly. transcript abundance is the parameter measured by the second genome-wide profiling approach. this is in contrast to transcript abundance, which is the parameter measured by the second genome-wide profiling approach. a number of challenges and limitations exist. real-time PCR technology is currently considered the gold standard for the analysis of gene expression. it relies on dense arrays of oligonucleotide probes that will capture complementary sequences present in biological samples at various concentrations. sensitivity of microarrays is low compared to other approaches such as real-time PCR. RNA-seq is expected to become sufficiently cost-effective and practical that it will eventually supersede microarray technologies. nanostring technology measures RNA abundance at the single molecule level. RNA serves as starting material for this assay, which does not involve the use of enzymes for amplification or labeling. up to 500 different transcripts can be detected in a single reaction on this platform. the starting RNA population must first be converted into a library of cDNA fragments. for a given sample tens of millions of such sequences will then be uniquely mapped against a reference genome. multiple cell types and soluble mediators, including IL10 [22,23] and IFN [24-26], have been proposed to be at the center of lupus pathogenesis. some observations did not support the hypothesis: not every SLE patient has detectable serum type I IFN levels. systemic onset juvenile arthritis is another disease with systemic involvement. blood signatures have been obtained from patients with multiple sclerosis. systemic involvement has been recognized in recent years to be an important component of autoimmune diseases. alterations in blood transcript abundance have been measured in the blood of patients with infectious diseases. patterns of transcript abundance measured in the blood of patients with infections caused by different etiological agents were found to be distinct. alterations in patterns of transcript abundance also found in patients with localized infections. some pathogens will persist and establish chronic infections that may lead to a state of latency (for example, tuberculosis) transcript profiling studies have been carried out in the cancer research field. blood profiles have also been obtained from solid organ transplant recipients. the body of published work is too large to be cited in this review. other efforts have yielded blood transcriptional signatures in patients with neurodegenerative diseases [109-111] and those associated with disease exacerbation or responsiveness to glucocorticoids in patients with asthma [112,113], exercise [117,118] or even laughter [119]. data management has become the first essential step to making large scale molecular profiling a viable proposition. this includes sample information, data quality metrics, clinical information collected at the time of sampling, details about the experimental design, and materials and methods. implementing effective data management solutions and practices is essential to sustain the necessary increase in the scale of blood transcriptional studies. a myriad of approaches have been developed for the analysis of genome-wide transcriptional profiling data [121-124] but there is no silver bullet when it comes to microarray data analysis. the challenges encountered are dimensionality, or how to cope with the fact that the number of parameters measured exceed by several orders of magnitude the number of conditions included in most experiments. a priori grouping of sets of genes with similar transcriptional patterns are grouped together to form what we have termed a transcriptional module. this allows focusing downstream statistical testing on these sets of transcripts that form coherent transcriptional and functional modular units. this is in contrast with more traditional approaches that rely on iterative statistical testing for thousands of individual transcripts that are treated as independent variables. oligonucleotide probes present on a microarray do not detect a signal for any of the samples in a given analysis. a detection filter is applied to exclude transcripts expressed in the dataset. this filter is applied independently of any knowledge of sample grouping or phenotype, which makes this type of analysis 'unsupervised' clustering is an iterative agglomerative clustering method that can be used to produce gene trees and condition trees. other commonly employed clustering algorithms include k-means clustering and self-organizing maps. such analyses identify genes that are differentially expressed among study groups and/or time points. class prediction analyses assess the ability of gene expression data to correctly classify a study subject or sample. other available class prediction procedures include discriminant analysis, general linear model selection, logistic regression, distance scoring, partial least squares, partition trees, and radial basis machine. two approaches exist for 'deconvoluting' these two phenomena. one can isolate and individually profile different cell populations present in the blood. a second approach consists of deconvoluting whole blood transcriptional profiles 'in silico' blood transcriptome profiling is becoming a mainstream tool for the assessment of the status of the human immune system. data management has become the first essential step to making large scale molecular profiling a viable proposition. implementing effective data management solutions and practices is essential to sustain the necessary increase in the scale of blood transcriptional studies. data management efforts occurring 'behind the scenes' have an essential role to play in realizing the full potential of high throughput profiling approaches in human subjects. a myriad of approaches have been developed for the analysis of genome-wide transcriptional profiling data. we have developed a data mining strategy for the specific purpose of analyzing blood transcriptional profiles [15]. this approach simply consists of a priori grouping of sets of genes with similar transcriptional patterns. this is repeated for several different datasets and subsequently, when comparing the cluster membership of all the genes across those datasets, the genes with similar membership are grouped together to form what we have termed a transcriptional module. oligonucleotide probes present on a microarray do not detect a signal for any of the samples in a given analysis. a detection filter is applied to exclude transcripts that are expressed in the dataset. this filter could select transcripts with expression levels that deviate by at least two-fold from the median intensity calculated across multiple arrays. this additional filter is applied independently of any knowledge of sample grouping or phenotype, which makes this type of analysis 'unsupervised' pattern discovery algorithms are often applied to identify'molecular phenotypes' or trends in the data. 1% of the statistically significant transcripts might be identified as significant by chance alone (false positives) other available class prediction procedures include discriminant analysis, general linear model selection, logistic regression, distance scoring, partial least squares, partition trees, and radial basis machine. 'deconvoluting' whole blood transcriptome research will benefit from conceptual advances that may help address shortcomings inherent to whole blood profiling. first, one can isolate and individually profile different cell populations present in the blood. a second approach consists of deconvoluting whole blood transcriptional profiles 'in silico' arium used to study the human immune system. changes in transcript abundance recapitulate the influence of genetic, epigenetic, cellular and environmental factors. this approach has become both robust and practical."}
