{"summary": "insulated isothermal PCR (iiPCR) technology enables consistent PCR amplification and detection in a simple heating device. a pan-dengue virus (DENV) RT-iiPCR targeting the 5\u2019 untranslated region was validated previously on the semi-automated POCKIT combo system. a compact automated sample-in-answer-out system has been available commercially for iiPCR. four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) have been identified. four serotypes of dengue virus (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) have been identified, with distinct genotypes within each serotype. aegypti can also pick up DENV from people showing no symptoms or oligo symptom, resulting in silent transmission. DENV causes different clinical signs in humans, from mild febrile illness (DF) to life-threatening condition such as hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome (DHF/DSS) the pan-DENV reverse transcription-iiPCR (RT-iiPCR) is a potential tool for the detection of DENV in human serum. it offers great analytical and clinical performances for rapid detection of DENV in human serum. the field-deployable system includes one automated NA extraction device. PCR/RT-iiPCRs on the POCKIT system have been validated for sensitive and specific detection of various parasitic, bacterial, and viral pathogens in animals and humans. a compact fully automated sample-to-answer system (POCKIT Central Nucleic Acid Analyser, POCKIT Central) is commercially available recently, in which modules in the existing system (automated NA extraction and compact POCKIT PCR modules) were integrated with a liquid handling module. the use of retrospective clinical specimens in this study was approved by the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital Institutional Review Board. the use of retrospective clinical specimens in this study was approved by the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital Institutional Review Board (KMUHIRB-F(I)-20180032) two viruses known to also cause febrile illness or skin rash illness were tested. zika virus (MR766, PRVABC59 strain) was from the American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA, USA. ypti mosquitoes were injected individually with DENV-1 (Hawaii Strain, 400 PFU), DENV-2 (NGC Strain, 400 PFU), DENV-3 (DN9000475A Strain, 400 PFU), or DENV-4 (DN9000475A Strain, 400 PFU) by micro-injection into the thoracic cavity. total mosquitoes were homogenized for plaque forming assay after 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 14 days post- all nucleic acids were collected individually and placed at -80\u00b0C. a 50 L volume of the premix/sample mixture was transferred into an R-tube. qualitative results were shown on the display screen in less than one hour. the values 0.20, 0.21\u20130.39, 0.40\u20130.59, 0.60\u20130.79, 0.80\u20130.90, and > 0.90 were interpreted as no, minimal, weak, moderate, strong, and almost perfect agreement. the use of retrospective clinical specimens in this study was approved by the Kaohsiung Medical University Hospital Institutional Review Board. two viruses known to also cause febrile illness or skin rash illness were tested for analytical specificity. a total of 60 archived serum specimens were collected from clinically suspected dengue patients with informed consent. A. aegypti mosquitoes (UGAL strain) were injected individually with DENV-1 (Hawaii Strain, 400 PFU), DENV-2 (NGC Strain, 400 PFU), DENV-3 (DN8700829A Strain, 400 PFU), or DENV-4 (400 PFU) by micro-injection into the thoracic cavity. nucleic acid extraction on the taco mini was done using the taco preloaded DNA/RNA Extraction Kit (GeneReach Biotech). 200 L of the sample were added into the first well of the extraction plate. subsequent PCR detection was done manually on a POCKIT device. the results indicated that performances of pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the two PCR systems were comparable. the results indicated that performances of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the two systems were comparable. pan-DENV RT-iiPCR detected the four DENV serotypes (DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4) and did not react with the two Zika virus and one chikungunya virus strains. the assay also had great specificity for DENV RNA on the fully automated POCKIT central system. clinical performance of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the semi-automated POCKIT combo system was previously validated to be equivalent to that of the CDC DENV-1-4 real-time RT-PCR. a total of 60 archived serum specimens (30 DENV positive, 10 of DENV-1, -2 and -3 each; 30 DENV negative) were tested. the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR detected 40 positive samples and 20 negative samples by both PCR systems. the overall agreement between the two systems was 100% (CI95%, 95.7\u2013100%; = 1.0), indicating the reagent can work with the fully automated PCR system to provide performance equivalent to that with the semi-automated PCR system. pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on both fully automated and semi-automated POCKIT systems were comparable. the results indicated that performances of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on the two PCR systems were comparable. 0/3 DENV-3 103 3/3 3/3 102 3/3 3/3 101 3 / 3 3/3 100 2/3 3 / 3 101 0/3 1/3 102 0/3 0/3 0/3 DENV, dengue virus; PFU, plaque forming unit; RT-iiPCR, reverse transcription-insulated isothermal PCR. the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR with the automated PCR system detected the four DENV serotypes. clinical serum samples were tested using the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR reagent on the fully automated and semi-automated PCR systems. a total of 60 archived serum specimens (30 DENV positive, 10 of DENV-1, -2 and -3 each; 30 DENV negative) collected from clinically suspected dengue patients were tested. reagent can work with fully automated PCR system to provide performance equivalent to that with semi-automated PCR system. titers are higher than the sensitivity of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR/POCKIT central system. titers are higher than the sensitivity of the pan-DENV system. type 2 serotype 3 serotype 4 Fully automated + + + + + Discussion Testing with the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR. the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR performed equally well on both systems. timely on-site detection of DENV in human and mosquito can alert front-line health professionals to allow timely implementation of interventions. the previously available pan-DENV RT-iiPCR/semi-automated PCR system enabled sensitive and specific molecular diagnostic tests near POC/PON. users simply have to put 200 uL serum into a preloaded extraction cartridge, place both the extraction and reagent cartridges into the device. the results are ready in 85 min. the fully automated system automates nucleic acid extraction, PCR reagent preparation, and PCR amplification, detection, and data interpretation to provide qualitative results on the monitor. the fully automated and semi-automated PCR systems allow applications of the pan-DENV RT-iiPCR to detect DENV in the local mosquito populations even at remote regions. sample info and test results of clinical and mosquito samples with pan-DENV RT-iiPCR on fully automated POCKIT Central system and semi-automated POCKIT combo system."}
