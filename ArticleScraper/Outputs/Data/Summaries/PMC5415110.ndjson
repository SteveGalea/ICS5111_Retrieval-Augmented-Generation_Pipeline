{"summary": "a viral aetiological agent is estimated to be involved in up to 80% of cases. the majority of these agents have never been specifically identified. insufficient epidemiological information is available for the many other respiratory viruses that can cause Acute respiratory infections. ARIs are a group of diseases with normally less than 15 days of evolution. a viral aetiological agent is estimated to be present in up to 80% of cases. upper ARIs include epiglottitis, laryngitis, laryngotracheobronchitis (croup), bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. a large percentage of ARIs are caused by viral infections, but the causative viruses have not been specifically identified in the majority of cases due to difficulties such as the high number of possible aetiological agents, similar symptoms among ARIs caused by different aetiological agents, and the high cost of the detection tests. the investigation of the causative agents of acute respiratory infections is important in order to lead the development of vaccines to target the most prevalent viruses. irritability is considered a cardinal sign in place of cephalalgia. fever is not required as a cardinal symptom in patients under five years of age. in patients older than 65 years, fever is not required as a cardinal symptom. the human RNAse P (RP) gene was used as an internal control. the viruses were evaluated in uniplex reactions.

Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics were used to analyse the prevalence of the viruses included in the study. 0\u20139 years of age (30.4%), 28 to young people 10\u201319 years of age (3.2%), 263 to adults 20\u201359 years of age (30.2%) and 316 to adults 60 years and older (36.2%) were analysed from patients from three geographical areas of the country. 58 6.7 Asthma 40 4.6 HIV 14 1.6 Pregnancy 10 1.1 Symptoms n % Average number of symptoms 7.61 \u2014\u2014 Cough 794 91.1 Dyspnoea 701 80.4 Fever 633 73.0 Headache 545 62.5 Rhinorrhea 500 57.3 Prostration 488 56.0 Myalgia 447 51.3 Chest pain 444 50.9 Chill 432 49.5 Arthralgia IC 95% Negative 560/872 (64.2) 61.0\u201367.4 Positive (at least 1 virus) 312/872 (35.8) 32.6\u201339.0 Virus Detection n/N (%) IC 95% RV 103/312 (33.0) 27.8\u201338.2 HRSV 96/312 (30.8) 25.6\u201335.9 HMPV 33/312 (10.6) 7.2\u201314.0 HMdV 30/312 (9.6) in 48.3% of the cases, HRSV (35.7%) and HMdV (32.1%). the behaviour of HMdV was similar, with 60% of all cases in which this virus was present involving a combination with other viruses. both cases represent a significant association (p0.05) with co-infection. a comparison was performed between the days of hospitalization required by the patients with negative samples and those with samples positive for a single virus. the hospitalization was significantly higher in the negative samples than in the positive ones for a virus or with co-infections. we observed the same tendency with the average number of comorbidities and symptoms: 0.65 in the negative samples versus 0.35 in positive samples. the 0- to 9-year-old age group comprised 91.1% of the co-infections. this group contained 92.9% of all PBpV infections, 86.7% of the HMdV infections, and 86.5% of the HRSV cases. spring (March 21 to June 20) accounted for the greatest proportions of RV, HMdV, HPIV4, and HPIV1 cases (29.5%, 38.5%, 46.8%, and 48.0%, respectively). winter (December 21 to March 20) presented the highest prevalence of HMPV (47.3%) and CoV1 (60.5%). huila, Nuevo Le\u00f3n, Durango, Sinaloa, Zacatecas, San Luis Potos, Tamaulipas, Nayarit, and Aguascalientes for 16.1% of the samples. the central zone (Guanajuato, Quer\u00e9taro, Hidalgo, Morelos, Jalisco, Colima, Michoac\u00e1n, Estado de M\u00e9xico, Tlaxcala, and Distrito Federal [ is pain 444 50.9 Chill 432 49.5 Arthralgias 386 44.3 Odinophalgias 372 42.7 Abdominal pain 204 23.4 Irritability 186 21.3 Conjunctivitis 165 18.9 Diarrhea 118 13.5 Cyanosis 111 12.7 Polypnea 111 12.7 Fig 1. Prevalence and positivity Of the total samples analysed, 312 were positive for at least 1 virus co-infections among respiratory viruses cause ARIs. 46 cases of co-infections were caused by 2 viruses (82.1%), 8 by 3 viruses (14.3%), and 2 by 4 viruses (3.6%). cases represent a significant association (p0.05) with co-infection. etiologic agent Co-infection of 2 Viruses Co-infection of 3 Viruses Co-infection of 4 Viruses Total Percentage of total co-infections (N = 56) 0.65 in the negative samples versus 0.35 in positive samples. 7.7 in the negative samples against 7.4 in positive samples. the number of clinical symptoms and comorbidities was greater in the ARIs positive for a single virus than in the patients with co-infections. seasonality of the non-influenza respiratory viruses. the month of November presented the highest percentage of cases during the year. seasonality of the non-influenza respiratory viruses. most HRSV (48.2%) and EV (72.6%) cases were detected in the fall (September 21 to December 20), and winter (December 21 to March 20) the other viruses (HCoV 229E, HCoV HKU1, HPIV 3, PBpV, and HCoV NL63) were detected throughout the year. 872 samples collected over one year were evaluated to determine the presence of non-influenza respiratory viruses in the mexican population. these 14 respiratory viruses share symptoms with influenza but are rarely suspected or can be confused with influenza. this study included samples corresponding to all age groups and regions of the country. RV was identified as the most common virus in ARI cases in several studies [17;20;22;27] in which the presence of influenza and other respiratory viruses from throat swabs is determined by molecular techniques of own design or using commercial panels. similar to RV, HRSV was identified in high proportions in other studies [4;37], conducted in Poland and in Mexico. 91.1% of all co-infections occurred in the 0 to 9 year age group. the virus most involved in co-infections was PBpV. in 78.6% of cases in which it was identified, it was found together with another virus. the ARIs caused by a single virus also presented lengthier hospitalization times than ARIs caused by 2 or more viruses. differences in the reported ranges of and discrepancies in the severity associated with viral co-infections can be attributed to the detection techniques employed. in winter, the prevalences of HMPV, HPIV3, and BCoV1 were higher than in the other seasons of the year. the circulation of HMPV predominates in the colder seasons because a marked reduction in its prevalence is observed in the spring until it disappears completely in the summer. in a study conducted in china, 525 children between 1 and 15 years of age were analysed and in other study performed in other study performed in other countries. a wide range of respiratory viruses circulating in Mexico constitute a risk for the population. our data suggest that including these tests more widely in the diagnostic algorithm for influenza could reduce the use of unnecessary antibiotics."}
