{"summary": "1,368 laboratory-confirmed human cases of MERS-CoV in Asia, Europe, the united states, and north africa have been reported to the world health organization (WHO), including at least 487 deaths. a recent MERS-CoV outbreak in south Korea emerged when an index case returned home on may 4 after traveling in the Middle East. the analytic solution of the Richards model is of the form C t = K 1 + e r a t t i ln a r a 1 a, where C(t) is the cumulative number of laboratory confirmed cases at day t, where t = 0 is May 11, the starting date of the MERS-CoV outbreak. applications of the Richards model on various infectious disease outbreaks can be found in, e.g., Hsieh et al. (2011) or Hsieh (2013). reproduction number R0 is the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by an infectious case in a totally susceptible population in the absence of specific control measures. the analytic solution of the Richards model is of the form C t = K 1 + e r a t t i ln a r a 1 a, where C(t) is the cumulative number of laboratory confirmed cases at day t, where t = 0 is May 11, the starting date of the MERS-CoV outbreak. applications of the Richards model on various infectious disease outbreaks can be found in, e.g., Hsieh et al. (2011) or Hsieh (2013). r is the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by an infectious case in a totally susceptible population in the absence of specific control measures. the Richards model to cumulative MERS case data by onset date, 5/11\u20136/14, 2015, for a total of 166 reported cases, to the Richards model. the 95% CIs of the estimates are given in parenthesis. the estimated outbreak turning point of ti = 23.3 days (95% CI [22.6\u201324.0]) pinpoints to June 3\u20134 as the time of the turning point or the peak incidence for this outbreak by onset date. we believe that may 27\u201329 is the peaking time when the number of infections occurring at the time reaches a maximum and starts to decrease. the 6th\u201312th cases from the first cluster were tested positive for MERS-CoV, including two health professionals who cared for the index case. the remaining cases were either patients or their spouse who shared the room with the index patient during May 15\u201317. it is likely due to the nosocomial nature of outbreak that was studied in Majumder et al. (2014). it is similar to that of the south Korea nosocomial outbreak. estimates of basic reproduction number for nosocomial infections and superspreading events would be misleading and inappropriate. the 2003 SARS epidemic quickly ended in all affected areas in a few months and has not emerged again. this is further affirmed by the recent MERS-CoV outbreak in south Korea, where community spread was effectively prevented with timely intervention measures. the Richards model fitting for daily incidence data. click here for additional data file. ying-Hen Hsieh conceived and designed the experiments."}
