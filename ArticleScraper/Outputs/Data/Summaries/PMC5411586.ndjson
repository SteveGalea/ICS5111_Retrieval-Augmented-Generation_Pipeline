{"summary": "coronaviruses are a group of positive-strand RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. they are broadly distributed among mammalian and avian species. they cause acute and persistent infections. the tight junction protein occludin has been identified as an essential host factor for entry of several viruses. the tight junction protein claudin-1 is tightly related to the infection of dengue virus, HCV, west Nile virus, and others. however, the role of tight junctions in PEDV infection has not yet been defined. PEDV infection alters occludin expression and distribution in IPEC-J2 cells. PEDV infection leads to upregulation of occludin mRNA. IPEC-J2 cells were infected with PEDV at an MOI of 1. PEDV induces occludin internalization in virus-infected vero E6 cells. cells were mock infected or infected with PEDV at an MOI of 0.1. total RNA was used to determine mRNA levels of occludin. occludin staining was less evident in the junctional area. PEDV infection did not markedly alter the cell junctional localization of the tight junction protein claudin-1. claudin-1 remained at the typical cell-cell junctional region during PEDV infection. western blot results confirmed that occludin was overexpressed in both types of cells. PEDV infectivity in occludin-overexpressing Vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells increased 4.1- and 11.5-fold, respectively, compared to that in vector control-treated parental cells. detergent lysates from cells transduced with occludin or the vector control were subjected to immunofluorescence assay. the percentage of PEDV-infected cells was determined by immunofluorescence staining with anti-PEDV spike protein MAb. occludin gene silencing does not impair the integrity of tight junctions in target cells. the susceptibility of occludin-silenced IPEC-J2 cells to PEDV infection was approximately 70% lower than that of control cells. the reduction in the titer of progeny virus was confirmed by measuring the TCID50. IPEC-J2 (B) and Vero E6 (F) cells were transfected with 100 nM siRNA duplexes. at 48 h posttransfection, cell monolayers were fixed and stained for occludin/claudin-1 (green) and the nucleus (blue) occludin siRNA reduced the endogenous occludin expression in both vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. occludin siRNA reduced the endogenous occludin expression in both vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. PEDV infection induced the internalization of occludin, which might be due to its removal from the cell surface by macropinocytosis pathways. we compared occludin and virus internalization levels in cells treated with a nontoxic dose of EIPA or with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the carrier control. both occludin and virus internalization occur through a macropinocytotic pathway during PEDV infection. the role of occludin in virus entry was further examined. we pretreated vero E6 cells with EIPA to block the internalization of occludin. however, only weak colocalization of occludin with PEDV protein was detected. monolayers were exposed to PEDV for 1 h after treatment with DMSO, EIPA, or rottlerin (10 M) at 48 hpi, virus yields were determined by a TCID50 assay with Vero E6 cells. data are representative of three independent experiments. macropinocytosis inhibitor does not affect virus infection at a late stage. occludin protein may serve as a scaffold in vicinity of virus entry. occludin is a tight junction protein that enters its host through fecal-oral route. claudin-1 mRNA levels were significantly upregulated in virus-infected IPEC-J2 and Vero E6 cells. protein levels of occludin were increased in virus-infected IPEC-J2 and vero E6 cells at 24 and 48 h postinfection. PEDV infection alters occludin expression and distribution in IPEC-J2 cells. escence staining and confocal microscopy were used to detect and analyze the virus (red), occludin/claudin-1 (green), and the nucleus (blue) results are representative of three independent experiments (means SD) we examined the cellular distribution of occludin and claudin-1 in IPEC-J2 cells upon virus infection. the tight junction protein occludin showed a pronounced distribution at the cell-cell junction in mock-treated IPEC-J2 cells. however, in PEDV-infected cells, occludin staining was less evident. more than 95% of vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells were green fluorescence positive. occludin was overexpressed in both types of cells. occludin-overexpressing vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells increased 4.1- and 11.5-fold. bicistronic lentivirus vector expressing ZsGreen alone (vector control) or occludin plus ZsGreen. detergent lysates from cells transduced with occludin or the vector control were subjected to immunoblotting. occludin protein levels were significantly reduced in occludin siRNA-transfected cells. occludin gene silencing does not impair the integrity of tight junctions in target cells. the susceptibility of occludin-silenced IPEC-J2 cells to PEDV infection was approximately 70% lower than that of control cells. IPEC-J2 (A) and Vero E6 (E) cells were transfected with occludin-specific siRNA or control siRNA for 24 h. at 48 h posttransfection, cell monolayers were fixed and stained for occludin/claudin-1 (green) and the nucleus (blue) occludin siRNA reduced the endogenous occludin expression in both vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. occludin siRNA reduced the endogenous occludin expression in both vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells. macropinocytosis is a form of endocytosis which has been identified as an entry mechanism for several viral pathogens. we observed that PEDV infection induced the internalization of occludin, which might be due to its removal from the cell surface by macropinocytosis pathways. occludin and virus internalization occur through a macropinocytotic pathway during PEDV infection. the role of occludin in virus entry was further examined. we pretreated vero E6 cells with EIPA to block the internalization of occludin. however, only weak colocalization of occludin with PEDV protein was detected. monolayers were exposed to PEDV for 1 h after treatment with DMSO, EIPA, or rottlerin (10 M) at 48 hpi, virus yields were determined by a TCID50 assay with vero E6 cells. sis inhibitor did not inhibit PEDV entry and replication in either vero E6 (Fig. 8A and B) or IPEC-J2 (Fig. 8C and D) cells. these data suggest that macropinocytosis or a macropinocytosis-like process is involved in virus entry during early events of infection. internalization of the tight junction protein occludin occurs by a macropinocytosis-like process upon PEDV infection. inhibitors that block macropinocytosis can block both occludin internalization and virus entry. occludin knockdown impairs PEDV infection. rotaviruses infect intestinal columnar epithelial cells and significantly alter the distribution of the tight junction proteins claudin-1 and occludin to promote virus infection. a similar event has been observed during human CBV infection, which alters the integrity of tight junctions and induces occludin internalization. occludin protein does not mediate the initial attachment of virions to target cells. this suggests that occludin appears not to interact directly with virus at the cell surface. this suggests that another attachment receptor may serve to bind the viral particles and thus help to concentrate viruses on the cell surface. occludin does not directly bind PEDV on the cell surface and is not associated with PEDV in the cytoplasm. however, occludin may serve as a scaffold in vicinity of virus entry. further work is needed to conclusively answer this question. porcine intestinal epithelium cDNA was cloned into the bicistronic lentivirus vector pLVX-IRES-ZsGreen1 (Clontech) the nucleotide sequences of the plasmids expressing occludin were determined to ensure that the correct clones were used. CTTCCTGGGCATGGAGTCC Porcine -actin-Rb a A Flag tag was fused at the carboxyl terminus of occludin by PCR. a small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were introduced to knock down endogenous occludin expression. vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with 100 nM occludin-specific or scrambled control siRNA isopropyl) amiloride (EIPA) and rottlerin (60, 61) (Sigma) were used at 50 M and 10 M, respectively. after removal of the drugs, cell monolayers were infected with PEDV. at 4 or 12 hpi, the cells were fixed for subsequent determination of the occludin distribution and virus infection. polyclonal antibody (Thermo Fisher) or rabbit anti-claudin-1 monoclonal antibody (MAb) cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)/tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) cells were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino the rabbit anti-occludin polyclonal antibody was purchased from abcam. the mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid protein MAb was prepared in our laboratory. values are expressed as means standard deviation (SD) plasmids expressing occludin were determined to ensure the correct clones were used. the packaging and production of lentiviral vectors were performed as previously described. small interfering RNA (siRNA) duplexes were introduced to knock down endogenous occludin expression. vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells were transfected with 100 nM occludin-specific or scrambled control siRNA duplexes. at 4 or 12 hpi, the cells were fixed for subsequent determination of the occludin distribution and virus infection. at 24 h post-siRNA transfection, vero E6 and IPEC-J2 cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then incubated with PEDV for 2 h at 4\u00b0C, at MOIs of 0.1 and 1. cells were incubated with FITC/TRITC-conjugated goat anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch) cells were stained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) for 5 min and then examined with a leica SP2 laser scanning spectrum confocal system. the mouse anti-PEDV nucleocapsid protein MAb was prepared in our laboratory. data were analyzed using Student's t test and analyzed using Prism 5."}
