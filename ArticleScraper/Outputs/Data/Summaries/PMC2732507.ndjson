{"summary": "a titration method was set up for the EBN-associated virus in vero cells. the virus had a small plaque phenotype and titers of 106 to 107 PFU/mL. no specific neutralization was observed when polyvalent or monoclonal antibodies neutralized TGEV or the human coronaviruses OC43 or 229E were used in a standard neutralization assay. electron-dense particles approximately 30 nm in diameter were observed in the cytoplasm of infected cells but not in the nucleus. the size corresponds to that of the virions partially purified from the same cells. no viral factories were identified in association with the membranous structures. a coronavirus was present in the primary cell cultures from patients with the endemic nephropathy. the dominant and only virus detected in the cell cultures infected with the EBN-associated virus was unrelated to coronaviruses."}
