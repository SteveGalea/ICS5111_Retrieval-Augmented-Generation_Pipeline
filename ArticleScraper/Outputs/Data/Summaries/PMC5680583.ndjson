{"summary": "non-transformed human foreskin fibroblasts (HFFs) were infected with a HCMV-tagged laboratory strain of wild-type HCMV (WT-HCMV), AD169 (MOI 5) on second day post infection (dpi), virus infection was observed by GFP fluorescence (Figure 1a) on sixth day post infection, virus infection was observed by GFP fluorescence (Figure 1a) culture media color change (red to yellow) was visually observed on day 6 post infection (dpi), in HFFs infected with H-WT. cell viability (metabolic activity) of mock or H-WT-infected HFFs was quantified by qPCR and flow cytometer respectively. expression of anti-apoptotic genes and decrease in expression of pro-apoptotic genes favor cancer progression. HCMV infection induces oncogenic properties in non-transformed cells through upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes, resulting into enhanced cell proliferation. HCMV deubiquitinase is responsible for induction of oncogenic properties. HFFs were infected with equal MOI of GFP-tagged H-WT and HDUB. equal amount of GFP expression was microscopically observed at 24 h post infection. cell cycle stages of mock, H-WT and HDUB-infected HFFs were analyzed by flowcytometry by staining these HFFs with propidium iodide (PI) on 3 dpi. the cell proliferation rate of IMR32 cells, stably expressing vector UL48N or NDUB, was compared by initially seeding them into a density of 0.1 106 cells, followed by counting and re-seeding them on every alternate the IMR32 cells showed rapid proliferation than those stably expressing either DUB-UL48N or Vec. this was further confirmed by cell cycle analysis of IMR32 cells. HCMV-DUB induces cancer hallmarks The majority of viral infections lead to cell death. protein-expression analysis of anti-apoptotic genes showed increased expression in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs than in mock or DUB-HCMV-infected HFFs. expression level of few other anti-apoptotic genes decreased in case of both, ciap1, cflip and mcl-1. expression of several other anti- and pro-apoptotic genes was tested. expression of several other anti- and pro-apoptotic genes was tested. endogenous protein level of BCL2, BIRC3, Survivin, TP53, Caspase-3 and p21 was analyzed in HFFs upon 8 dpi with H-WT and HDUB (d) HCMV-infected HFF cells were treated with 30M etoposide on 3 dpi and analyzed for apoptosis rescue 24 h later by quantifying Annexin V level. shown results are the representative of three (a, b, d, e, f, g) or single (c) independent experiments. differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-value0.05, **P-value0.01 and ***P-value0.001. the expression-pattern of many of the pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes aligned with the expression-pattern of I-IFNs by WT- and DUB-HCMV. inhibition of pro-apoptotic and induction of anti-apoptotic gene expression by WT-HCMV infection could be due to inhibition of I-IFN synthesis. IMR32 cells transfected with Vec, UL48N and UL48NDUB expression plasmids as depicted. overexpression of UL48N and UL48NDUB was detected by using anti-FLAG antibody. significance of WT- or HDUB infection group was calculated compared with mock. shown results are representative of two (a\u2013d, and h\u2013o) or three (e\u2013g) independent experiments. differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-value0.05, **P-value0.01 and ***P-value0.001, ns, non-significant difference. synthesis of IFN in control HFFs whereas reduced the synthesis in mydd88 or sting knocked down HFFs. this suggests that in absence of either MyD88 or STING, induction of I-IFN synthesis is compromised during HCMV infection. all I-IFN promoters increased luciferase production when co-expressed with either the MyD88 or STING gene. replication status of both WT and DUB-HCMV in HFFs was gradually increased with time compared with DUB-HCMV. an MTT assay, done 3 days after rIFN treatment, showed antagonization of rIFN-mediated cell death by WT-HCMV-infected HFFs. cells treated with anti-IFNAR2 antibody showed enhanced proliferation (Figure 4n) and viability (Figure 4o) this suggests that induction of oncogenic properties upon WT-HCMV infection is owing to inhibition of I-IFNs. this suggests that induction of oncogenic properties upon WT-HCMV infection is owing to inhibition of I-IFNs. UL48N deubiquitinates the cytoplasmic (not the nuclear) signaling molecules activated by PRRs, whose ubiquitination is necessary for induction of I-IFNs. pUL48 is dispensable for the HCMV-DUB induced cell migration observed above. cellular localization of mCherry-tagged UL48N and UL48NNLS was observed under the fluorescence microscope at 63. nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33342. DUB activity of UL48N and UL48NNLS was compared. UL48N is able to deubiquitinate multiple signaling molecules to inhibit I-IFN production. the result showed that UL48N hugely deubiquitinates TRAF6, TRAF3, IRAK1, IRF7 or STING and slightly deubiquitinates IRAK1 and IRF7. ubiquitination status of UL48N or UL48NDUB was analyzed in HEK293 cells. co-transfection of HA-K63Ub, myc-TRAF6, myc-TRAF3 or myc-STING was done as depicted. infected cells showed a characteristic cytopathic effect (CPE) and change in growth media color (red to yellow) the color change owing at least in part to release of marker GFP from infected cells. a fourfold higher metabolic activity was observed for WT-HCMV-infected cells compared with uninfected cells. flowcytometry was done for mock and H-WT-infected HFFs by staining them with propidium iodide (PI, shown in x axis) on 3 dpi to detect cell cycle stages upon HCMV infection and (g) anti-apoptotic gene status was compared by qPCR in mock or H-WT-infected HFFs on 6 dpi. results are the representative of three (a\u2013d, the inactive DUB of Marek\u2019s disease herpesvirus compromises the ability of that virus to cause lymphoma in chickens. reports suggest that deregulation of cellular DUBs could also promote various cancer types in humans and mouse. quantification of HCMV infection was done with flow cytometer. histogram shows the percentage of HCMV infection at 24 hpi. culture media color change (red to yellow) was visually observed on 6 dpi. cell viability (metabolic activity) was quantified and compared. cell cycle stages IMR32 stably expressing vector UL48N or NDUB were analyzed by flowcytometry by staining the cells with PI. differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-value0.05, **P-value0.01 and ***P-value0.001. stably expressing WT-UL48N showed rapid proliferation than those expressing either DUB-UL48N or Vec (Figure 2h). HCMV-DUB induces cancer hallmarks The majority of viral infections lead to cell death through apoptotic pathways, which is a protective innate immune response. transcript level of bcl-xl anti-apoptotic gene was reduced. transcription of pro-apoptotic genes such as trail, Rb, p53, fadd and tnf remained unchanged. expression of these pro-apoptotic genes was higher in the DUB-HCMV-infected cells. differential expression of anti- and pro-apoptotic genes during WT-HCMV- and DUB-HCMV infection indicates that HCMV-pUL48 DUB activity interferes with the induction of apoptosis. the ability of anti-cancer drug etoposide to promote apoptosis was reduced by WT-HCMV infection. IMR32 cells stably expressing Vec, UL48N and UL48NDUB were glucose starved for 2 h and treated with FITC-labeled Glucose for 10 min and then subjected to flow cytometer to observe the glucose uptake (f, top) wound size was measured. 5 105 cells transiently transfected with Vec, UL48N and UL48NDUB expression plasmids were resuspended IMR32 cells stably expressing Vec, UL48N and UL48NDUB were glucose starved and treated with FITC-labeled glucose (2-NBDG) overexpression of UL48N increased cell migration and tissue invasion. HCMV-DUB inhibits anti-viral innate immunity for oncogenesis Viral infections can induce cellular anti-viral innate immune responses, including I-IFNs. inhibition of pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic gene expression could be due to inhibition of I-IFN synthesis. HCMV deubiquitinase inhibits anti-viral innate immunity to induce oncogenesis (a) transcript of pan-interferon- (P-IFN) and (b) IFN was measured by qPCR upon H-WT infection. TT assay was done with HCMV-infected and rIFN- treated HFFs as depicted. significance of rIFN- or HDUB infection group was calculated. differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-value0.05, **P-value0.01 and ***P-value0.001, ns, non-significant difference (P-value>0.05) HCMV induces innate immunity through several PRRs, including endosome localized TLR9 and cytosolic DNA sensors. all I-IFN promoters increased luciferase production when co-expressed with either the MyD88 or STING gene. in all cases the increase was inhibited upon co-expression of UL48N. UL48N overexpression also inhibited CpG (TLR9-Ligand)-stimulated transcription of I-IFN and IP10 in HeLa cells. after rIFN treatment, showed antagonization of rIFN-mediated cell death by WT-HCMV-infected HFFs. the UL48N-transfected IMR32 cells showed dose-dependent wound-healing compared with cells transfected with UL48NDUB or Vec. cyclin-D1 transcript level was measured in HCMV-infected HFFs after 2 dpi. cyclin-D1 expression was upregulated upon WT-HCMV infection compared with mock or DUB-HCMV infection to HFFs. this inversely correlated with the I-IFN results observed in Figures 4a and b. UL48N and UL48NNLS both inhibited IFN4 or IFN promoter activity. we hypothesized that UL48N deubiquitinates the cytoplasmic (not the nuclear) signaling molecules activated by PRRs. we also compared UL48NNLS with UL48N in a wound-healing assay. UL48N or UL48NNLS was over-expressed in IMR32 cells. wound was created and wound-healing was observed at 48 h. HCMV-DUB deubiquitinates PRR-mediated signal transducers. UL48N is able to deubiquitinate multiple signaling molecules to inhibit I-IFN production. HCMV-DUB targets various key molecules of the signaling cascade to suppress I-IFN and to induce oncogenesis. immunoprecipitated sample was blotted with anti-HA, anti-myc and anti-FLAG antibody to detect respective proteins. differences were considered statistically significant with a *P-value0.05, **P-value0.01 and ***P-value0.001, ns, non-significant difference. expression level of several other anti-apoptotic genes was reduced in WT-HCMV-infected HFFs. expression level of several other pro-apoptotic genes was either reduced or remained unchanged due to infection with both, WT- and DUB-HCMV in HFFs. maroon arrows show pathways during HCMV infection. UL48-DUB domain was expressed in IMR32 cell line. previous studies have also shown HCMV-infected human cells to be resistant to apoptosis. HCMV inhibits I-IFN to counteract host innate immunity. inhibition of I-IFN synthesis by HCMV indicates its potential to establish a pro-cancer microenvironment. studies suggest that people having a particular SNP in TLR9 are more susceptible to HCMV infection and cancer development.
