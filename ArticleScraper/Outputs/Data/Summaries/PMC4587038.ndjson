{"summary": "the 2015 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics will be celebrated in grand style. a special issue with a touch of reflection, a bit of rediscovery, and some \u201cscience-fiction\u201d will be published in addition to the usual edition. the topic in 2105 chosen for the IMIA yearbook is \" Patient-centered care coordination\" a key success factor to care coordination is sharing the same holistic view of a patient\u2019s condition by all actors, including the patient\u2019s active diseases. the Office of the US National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) promotes the adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs) to address health information sharing and care coordination. however, while EHRs are necessary, they are not sufficient to care coordination. this early first portion of the yearbook also includes a History-of-Medical-Informatics paper authored by Prof. Casimir A. Kulikowski. the IMIA Yearbook used to have 10 sections: the \u201cSpecial\u201d section, which varies every year according to the special theme of the year (Patient-centered care coordination in 2015), Health and Clinical Management, Human Factors and Organizational Issues, Health Information Systems, Sensor, Signal and Imaging Informatics, Decision Support, Knowledge Representation and Management, Education and Consumer Health Informatics, Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics. public health informatics was defined in 2000 as \"the systematic application of information and computer science and technology to public health practice, research, and learning\" a new section dedicated to clinical natural language processing will provide a selection of excellent work addressing topics beyond Knowledge Representation and Management. the editorial board of the IMIA Yearbook is also very pleased to announce a new section \u201cPublic Health and Epidemiology Informatics\u201d in 2015. this year will be the year of the 25th anniversary of the yearbook."}
