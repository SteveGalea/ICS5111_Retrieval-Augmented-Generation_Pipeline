{"summary": "sarcoidosis clinical manifestations and disease course of sarcoidosis are both variable and largely unpredictable. a majority of patients experience remission, typically within the first 2\u20133 years. 30\u201350% of patients have unremitting chronic disease that can lead to significant organ dysfunction requiring long-term corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy. in the lung, the sarcoidosis inflammatory cascade displays a polarized T helper type 1 (Th1) lymphocyte response, with increased production of IFN-, IL-2, IL-12, and IL-18 (7). more recently, studies have suggested that Th17 effector T-cell responses may contribute to sarcoidosis pathobiology. whether these responses are critical to disease pathogenesis or play a role in shaping clinical phenotype remains uncertain (8, 9 independent molecular and immunologic investigations have suggested the association of pathogenic mycobacteria with some cases of sarcoidosis. several research groups have reported enhanced Th1 immune responses to specific mycobacterial proteins in subjects with sarcoidosis compared with control subjects (14\u201318). genome-wide transcriptome profiling has been used to better define sarcoidosis pathogenesis. these studies have confirmed an association with Th1 genes and pathways known to be relevant in sarcoidosis. gene expression patterns are associated with disease severity (26, 27) and disease course (26) in the lung, the sarcoidosis inflammatory cascade displays a polarized T helper type 1 (Th1) lymphocyte response. the pathologic hallmark of sarcoidosis is epithelioid granulomas consisting of monocytes, macrophages, epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells, and eventually granuloma formation. independent molecular and immunologic investigations have suggested the association of pathogenic mycobacteria with some cases of sarcoidosis. several research groups have reported enhanced Th1 immune responses to specific mycobacterial proteins in sarcoidosis compared with control subjects. sarcoidosis results from hyperimmune Th1 response to tissue antigens. latter possibility may be associated with aberrant innate response. aggregation of serum amyloid A within granulomas (6, 25) human gut microbiome (37), where interaction of gut microflora plays a role in obesity, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. microbial DNA present in the healthy lung closely resembles that of the oropharynx, but in markedly lesser amounts, perhaps resulting from microaspiration. the presence of a chronic granulomatous inflammatory response in the lung in sarcoidosis has long suggested that infectious agents are important in sarcoidosis. no culture-based studies have directly proven an infectious pathogenesis of the disease. the human gut microbiome (37), where interaction of the gut microflora plays a role in obesity, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis (38\u201341) the human gut microbiome (37), where the interaction of the gut microflora, independently or through interaction with the genetic makeup of the host, plays a role in obesity, Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis. the presence of a chronic granulomatous inflammatory response in the lung in sarcoidosis has long suggested that infectious agents are important in sarcoidosis. no culture-based studies have directly proven an infectious pathogenesis of the disease. aims of the GRADS study are to understand how genomic and microbiomic relationships associate with clinical phenotypes. not all manifestations could be included, owing to disease heterogeneity and the limited sample size. more than 90% of patients with sarcoidosis have involvement of the lung. this is a well-studied site of disease pathogenesis and immune activity. phenotypic distinction of biologic importance is the separation of remitting versus chronic sarcoidosis. patients with sarcoidosis with clinically significant inflammation may represent one of the purest phenotypes in terms of outcome because they invariably have chronic, unremitting disease. phenotype 2: Stage I pulmonary sarcoidosis, untreated. phenotypes 3 and 4: Stages II and III pulmonary sarcoidosis, untreated and treated. remission occurs in 50% of those with stage II and 20% of those with Stage III pulmonary sarcoidosis when assessed at initial presentation. phenotype 9: Cardiac sarcoidosis is a major cause of sarcoidosis mortality and morbidity. sarcoidosis is a major cause of sarcoidosis mortality and morbidity. participants are either (1) classified within the targeted clinical phenotypes defined within this protocol upon review of their clinical information gathered from the initial study visit or (2) excluded from additional study participation. most subjects either undergo research BAL as part of an otherwise clinically indicated bronchoscopy for suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis or are recruited to undergo a research-only bronchoscopy with BAL. undergoing bronchoscopy with any one of the following: a.

CT = computed tomography; DlCO = diffusing capacity of carbon monoxide. high-throughput unbiased analyses of the lung microbiome can potentially identify patterns in the lung microbiome that determine disease activity and persistence. gene expression patterns characterize distinct sarcoidosis phenotypes. to determine whether patterns in the lung microbiome are associated with sarcoidosis severity and disease phenotypes. to correlate mRNA and microRNA expression patterns in sarcoidosis-affected organs. more than 90% of patients with sarcoidosis have involvement of the lung. sarcoidosis is a well-studied site of disease pathogenesis and immune activity. phenotypic distinction of biologic importance is the separation of remitting versus chronic sarcoidosis. patients with sarcoidosis with clinically significant inflammation may represent one of the purest phenotypes in terms of outcome because they invariably have chronic, unremitting disease. patients with sarcoidosis with clinically significant inflammation in many organs may represent one of the purest phenotypes. phenotypes 3 and 4: Stages II and III pulmonary sarcoidosis, untreated and treated. phenotypes are characterized by pulmonary fibrosis that is associated with chronic, unremitting disease in more than 95% of patients. phenotype 8: Cardiac sarcoidosis is a major cause of sarcoidosis mortality and morbidity. it is not clear whether the biologic correlates of this phenotype will resemble those of healthy control subjects. most subjects either undergo research BAL as part of an otherwise clinically indicated bronchoscopy for suspected pulmonary sarcoidosis or are recruited to undergo a research-only bronchoscopy with BAL. if a diagnosis of sarcoidosis is confirmed by biopsy, the patient is entered into the database of participants undergoing full testing and sample collection. lCO 40% predicted, resting hypoxemia 92% with or without oxygen. hypersensitivity to or intolerance of any of the drugs required for sedation during conscious sedation bronchoscopy. found to have an alternative interstitial lung disease during evaluation and/or screening. unable to comprehend consent document and/or questionnaires Conditional exclusions 1. Participants who present with an upper respiratory infection or pulmonary exacerbation can be rescreened for the study 28 d after discontinuing acute antibiotics. female participants who present 3 mo after giving birth will be asked to reschedule their visit until 3 mo have passed since the birth. high-throughput unbiased analyses of the lung microbiome can potentially identify patterns in the lung microbiome that determine disease activity and persistence as well as response to therapy. high-throughput unbiased analyses of the lung microbiome can potentially identify patterns in the lung microbiome that determine disease activity and persistence. Detailed information on occupational, recreational, environmental, and residential exposures is assessed using modifications of the ACCESS occupational and environmental questionnaires (54) these variables will be correlated with phenotype-specific associations and with microbiome and genome expression patterns. these variables will be correlated with microbiome and genome expression patterns. the chest CT protocol was developed to account for potential scanner variation across the clinical centers and body habitus (60, 61) the helical (spiral) chest CT data are acquired with the participants in the supine position during breath holding at end inspiration (or total lung capacity) and without radiopaque contrast dye. pre- and post-bronchodilator spirometry is performed to assess the degree of bronchodilator responsiveness. to confirm restrictive ventilatory impairment, lung volumes are obtained on participants whose slow vital capacity is less than 80% of the predicted value. participants without a confirmed clinical diagnosis are consented before their clinical bronchoscopy. if a diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy, the participant is enrolled in the study database and completes testing. participants are asked to consent to a skin biopsy if cutaneous involvement is deemed consistent with sarcoidosis. a portion of the BAL sample is sent for routine clinical tests at the discretion of the bronchoscopist. aliquots of whole blood are placed in solutions designed to preserve RNA and DNA integrity. a urine sample is obtained and assayed for cotinine at the clinical site. participants with a confirmed sarcoidosis diagnosis are consented before their clinical bronchoscopy. if a diagnosis is confirmed by tissue biopsy, the participant is enrolled in the study database and completes testing. participants are asked to consent to a skin biopsy if a cutaneous involvement is consistent with sarcoidosis. samples are processed to maximize sample integrity for RNA, microRNA, DNA, and proteins. a portion of the BAL fluid is centrifuged to separate it into a cell-free BAL fluid supernatant and a BAL cell pellet for microbiome, transcriptomic, and biochemical analyses. a portion of the BAL sample is sent for routine clinical tests at the discretion of the bronchoscopist. amplification of 16S rRNA genes (or 16S rDNA) is useful because this genetic locus is present in all bacterial species. the nine hypervariable regions of the 16S rDNA can be used for bacterial species identification. a minimum of 35 samples per group is required for detection with power exceeding 95% for changes of 1.25 or more. an overall sample size of 400 participants, with a goal of 44 or 45 subjects per phenotype, is planned to allow incomplete data collection. amplification of 16S rRNA genes (or 16S rDNA) is useful because this genetic locus is present in all bacterial species. sample size calculations for the analysis of variance are based on prior data showing that a minimum of 35 samples per group is required for detection with power exceeding 95% for changes of 1.25 or more. an overall sample size of 400 participants, with a goal of 44 or 45 subjects per phenotype, is planned to allow incomplete data collection. the sarcoidosis protocol is designed to explore how the lung microbiome and peripheral and lung genomes may shape different clinical phenotypes and outcomes in sarcoidosis. the sarcoidosis protocol is designed to explore how the lung microbiome and peripheral and lung genomes may shape different clinical phenotypes and outcomes in sarcoidosis. deirdre Walker National Jewish Health: Gina Atnes, B.A.; Briana Barkes, M.D.; Russell Bowler, M.D., Ph.D.; Jill Elliott, M.S.; May Gillespie, B.A.; Li Li, M.D., Ph.D.; Kristyn MacPhail, B.S.; Lisa Maier, M.D.; Robert Sandhaus, M.D. o, BSN; Mridu Gulati; and Erica Herzog, M.D., Ph.D. Observational Study Monitoring Board Jerome S.
