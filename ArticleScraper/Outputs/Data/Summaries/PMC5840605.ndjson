{"summary": "hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is performed to treat two broad categories of diseases. the first category consists of functional failure of bone marrow or marrow-derived cells. disease in the second category includes acute or chronic leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphomas, and myeloproliferative neoplasms. infectious diseases still affect the prognosis of HSCT recipients. in korea, HSCT was first performed in 1983 [5], and the number of transplants has rapidly increased over the past 30 years. delayed immune recovery is evident over a long period of time after engraftment. the risk of opportunistic infection varies depending on the type of anticancer drugs used, conditioning intensity (myeloablative or reduced intensity) and presence of acute GVHD. autologous HSCT leads to more rapid recovery of immune function than allogeneic HSCT recipients. a decrease in the number of neutrophils increases the susceptibility to infection. patients with neutropenia have a reduced number of leukocytes. inflammatory findings are common in patients with normal leukocyte counts. tment phase are the normal gastrointestinal flora and indwelling vascular catheters. Gram-negative bacilli (GNB) are common pathogens in the latter. Gram-positive cocci (GPC) are more common in the latter. immunoglobulin G2 and IgG4 have been reported in patients with chronic and severe GVHD. Deficiencies in immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) and IgG4 are associated with severe pneumonia, meningitis, and sepsis due to S. pneumoniae. 45% of neutropenic patients with carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae rectal colonization experienced bloodstream infection by an identical strain. a single-center, retrospective cohort study performed in Korea reported that the incidence of carbapenemresistant A. baumannii bacteremia was 0.53 cases per 10,000 patient-days. fluoroquinolone prophylaxis can reduce febrile neutropenic episodes and related mortality in allogeneic HSCT recipients. ciprofloxacin and levofloxacin are equally effective, but levofloxacin may be more effective in terms of broader coverage of viridans streptococci when oral mucositis is present. fluoroquinolone prophylaxis decreased the rate of identification of P. aeruginosa phylaxis Virus: during neutropenia or longer depending on risks High Allogenenic HSCT including unrelated or family mismatched donor Bacteria: consider PCP prophylaxis Prolonged neutropenia Virus: during neutropenia or longer depending on risks Secondary neutropenia after engraftment Status of malignancy not in remission GHVD. the de-escalation approach is generally recommended when high incidence of resistant pathogens in neutropenic fever, or high colonization rates of multiple drug resistance bacteria. however, the data on cut-offs for resistance are insufficient to formulate such a strategy. no randomized controlled study has compared the therapeutic efficacy of the approaches in HSCT recipients. enterobacteriaceae was the most common causative organism, accounting for 30% (range, 8% to 56%). coagulase-negative staphylococci was the most common organism until the mid-2000s. Deficiencies in immunoglobulin G2 and IgG4 have been reported in patients with chronic and severe GVHD. resistance Over the past decade, the frequency of detection of resistant bacteria has increased worldwide, including in patients with neutropenic fever and hematologic malignancies. the incidence of carbapenemresistant A. baumannii bacteremia was 0.53 cases per 10,000 patient-days. the rate of methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci is reportedly higher than 50% in most centers. the incidence rate of Staphylococcus aureus in HSCT patients is low with a high methicillin-resistance rate of median 56%. fluoroquinolone prophylaxis decreased the rate of identification of P. aeruginosa. but fluoroquinolone prophylaxis decreased the rate of identification of P. aeruginosa. fluoroquinolone prophylaxis may reduce the rate of bloodstream infections, but not the overall mortality rate. a recent data concern the correlation with fluoroquinolone prophylaxis and development of resistance or Clostridium difficile associated diarrhea. escalation vs. de-escalation therapy is recommended in neutropenic patients during the pre-engraftment phase. FUNGI Aspergillus species are the most common causes of invasive fungal infections (IFIs) in patients with hematologic diseases, followed by Candida spp. and rare fungi. the causative fungi are not different after HSCT. the characteristics of, and risk factors for, fungal infections differ according to the phase after transplantation. invasive aspergillosis (IA) that develops during the neutropenic period typically involves angioinvasion due to host immunosuppression. in a prospective observational study performed in the Asia-Pacific region, IA accounted for 65.9% of IFI. pergillus spp. was not the major fungal pathogen in centers in Thailand and Vietnam. the incidence of IFI is higher in allogeneic than in autologous HSCT. the established risk factors include chronic GVHD and steroid use. the time of neutropenia and the time of neutrophil recovery after HSCT suggest that the diagnostic criteria may need to be redefined. radiologic examinations such as chest X-ray and CT, and microbiological studies including fungal culture are required. the target trough level is 1 to 5.5 mg/L. prevalence and incidence of voriconazole-breakthrough IFIs were 2.25% and 0.22 cases per year, respectively. the overall mortality rate was 44.4%. proven/probable IA patients reportedly have a low culture-positive rate (17.7%) leukemia, allogeneic HSCT recipients, alemtuzumab, fludarabine, cyclophosphamide, rituximab, and steroid use should be performed as early as possible. CT, bronchoscopy, and BAL should be performed as early as possible if PCP is clinically suspected. the incidence of PCP was reduced by 91% (relative risk [RR], 0.09) in trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis group compared with placebo. however, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis did not markedly reduce all-cause mortality in a hematology population. trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole Primary choice for PCP prevention. consider side effects including fever, drug sensitivity rash, headache, nausea, vomiting, neutropenia, pancytopenia, meningitis, nephrotoxicity, hepatitis, hypoglycemia, hyperkalemia, and anaphylaxis. esophagitis, gastritis, colitis, hepatitis, pneumonia, retinitis, and encephalitis can be fatal despite aggressive anti-CMV therapy. CMV disease, especially CMV pneumonia or encephalitis, can be fatal despite aggressive anti-CMV therapy [75,76]. management of CMV is categorized into prevention, pre-emptive treatment, and definitive treatment. pre-emptive therapy is anti-CMV treatment even in the absence of clinical symptoms in cases with CMV infection (reinfection or reactivation) letermovir prophylaxis resulted in a significantly lower risk of clinically significant CMV infection than placebo. the fda approved letermovir for the prevention of CMV infection and diseases in adult CMV-seropositive patients undergoing allogeneic HSCT. since February 2018, the use of valganciclovir in HSCT patients with CMV infection has increased due to changes in the reimbursement rules. GVHD or the use of monoclonal antibodies (i.e., alemtuzumab) can increase the incidence of CMV infections. if there is persistent infection despite anti-CMV therapy, resistance should also be suspected. HERPES ZOSTER Herpes zoster is caused by the reactivation of virus latent in the posterior ganglia after primary infection with varicella zoster virus (VZV) in Korea, VZV is transmitted by natural infection in most cases. previous VZV infection is a prerequisite for herpes zoster [98-100] acyclovir prophylaxis can prevent herpes zoster after allogeneic or autologous HSCT. acyclovir prophylaxis can reduce the incidence of herpes simplex virus (HSV) and VZV infections. PTLD occurs less frequently after HSCT than after transplantation of other solid organs. PTLD occurs in cases of unrelated donor transplantation, T-cell-depleted transplantation, GVHD, and use of an anti-lymphocyte antibody to prevent GVHD. a blood BKV DNA level of > 103\u20134 copies/mL is reportedly associated with significant viruria. a negative plasma viral load does not rule out BKV-associated hemorrhagic cystitis. the incidence is higher in allogeneic than in autologous HSCT patients. CRV infections are frequent causes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in HSCT patients. CRV infections can also occur during neutropenia and show significant morbidity and mortality. the average mortality rate of CRV-LRTI is 32% (range, 0% to 70%) in international studies. the major risk factors for progression to LRTI are lymphopenia, old age, mismatched/unrelated donor, and neutropenia. oseltamivir can be administered prophylactically for 10 days if an immunocompromised patient comes into contact with a patient with confirmed influenza or influenza-like illness. treatment of rSV-URTI with aerosolized ribavirin significantly reduces the frequency of progression to LRTI. aerosolized ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) combination treatment significantly reduces RSV-LRTI-related mortality. no antiviral is available to treat CRV, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and bocavirus LRTIs. CRV infections are frequent causes of upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) in HSCT patients. CRV infections can also occur during neutropenia and show significant morbidity and mortality. in cases of PIV-LRTI, the overall mortality rate is 10% to 30%. high-level corticosteroid exposure, neutropenia, lymphopenia, and early onset after HSCT are the major risk factors for LRTI. in cases of rhinovirus, most infections are asymptomatic, less than 10% progress to definite pneumonia. treatment of CRVURTI with aerosolized ribavirin significantly reduces the frequency of progression to LRTI. a score of > 7 is associated with a significantly increased risk of progression to LRTI, suggesting the necessity of criteria for identifying high-risk groups. a recent double-blind, placebocontrolled study of GS-5806 (presatovir) involved 54 RSV-infected healthy adult volunteers who received RSV challenge intranasally. no antiviral is available to treat CRV, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, and bocavirus LRTIs. HSCT recipients are immunosuppressed as a result of their hematologic disease, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunosuppressive agents, and GVHD. 80% and 20% of allogeneic HSCT recipients were diagnosed with TB after HSCT. the median time to develop TB was 386 days after transplantation. Isoniazid is well tolerated in the post-HSCT period. concurrent itraconazole is not recommended due to drug interactions. the impact of voriconazole or posaconazole is unclear. in HSCT recipients with chronic graft-versus-host disease, a fourth PCV should be considered at intervals of more than 6 months. DTaP is preferred over tetanus toxoid-reduced diphtheria toxoid-reduced acellular pertussis vaccine (Tdap)"}
