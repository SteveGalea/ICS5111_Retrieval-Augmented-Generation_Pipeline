{"summary": "a system based on a Sendai virus minigenome produced heterologous viral glycoproteins in the allantoic cavity of embryonated eggs. the first step was rescuing in cell cultures Sendai virus minigenomes encoding the proteins of interest, with the helper virus. the second step was propagating such recombinant defective viruses, together with the helper virus, in the allantoic cavity of embryonated eggs. a repertoire of animal viruses has been grown in embryonated chicken eggs since the early 1930's. eggs have the appealing properties of low cost and ease of manipulation for large-scale production of viruses and recombinant proteins. cDNA cloning and rescue of recombinant paramyxoviruses still entails laborious steps. paramyxovirus minigenomes obtained by cDNA cloning can be amplified in transfected cells either expressing a minimal set of complementing viral proteins or superinfected with a wild type homologous helper virus. a seV minigenome seemed attractive and versatile vector for the expression of foreign proteins in chicken eggs. rVV expressing an anchorless form of HMPV/F protein has been made. cDNA SeV minigenome encodes an HA tagged SeV matrix protein (HA-M), flanked by a T7 RNA polymerase promoter and the hepatitis delta virus genomic ribozyme. expression of the HA-M protein can be achieved by transfecting cells with SVec/HA-M and three other plasmids en cells were harvested 24 h.p.i. and 200 l of culture supernatant were inoculated into 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. allantoic fluid was harvested and subjected to consecutive passages. western blot of allantoic fluid from passages 1\u20137 are compared with allantoic fluid from uninfected eggs (0). a restriction imposed by the number of nucleotides in the transcribed minigenome is a multiple of six. cells were transfected with SVec plasmids encoding HA-M, HRSV/FTM- or HMPV/FTM-. expression of the minigenome-encoded products in transfected cells was confirmed. a major band of the Sendai virus F protein was detected after the first passage in eggs. protein bands of the recombinant proteins were detected only after 2\u20133 passages. this is likely to reflect the competition between minigenomes and full-length SeV genomes for replication and incorporation into virus particles. allantoic fluids (4.5 ml) from eggs inoculated with mixed stocks of SeV and SeV minigenomes were centrifuged through a 25% glycerol cushion. five microliters of allantoic fluid from uninfected eggs (0) were compared with 5 l of allantoic fluid from eggs inoculated with virus stocks encoding indicated proteins. asterisk denotes a rVV band that cross-reacts with anti-F specific reagents. the concentrations of FTM- proteins in the allantoic fluids were 5\u201310-fold higher than in the cell supernatants. this yield reduces the production cost of FTM- proteins about 10 times, considering only the cost of plastic and medium for growing animal cells in comparison with the cost of eggs. allantoic fluid (10 l) from passage 4 of defective SeV expressing HRSV/FTM- (1) compared to allantoic fluid from SVec/HRSV/FTM- NN infected eggs (2), HRSV/FTM-NN after concentration and affinity chromatography (3). NN mutant has been purified to homogeneity following same purification scheme used previously for purification of FTM- from rVV-infected cells. mononegavirales minigenomes expressing foreign reporter genes have been used extensively to dissect cis-acting sequences, including promoters, transcription signals and RNA editing signals. there is no reason to believe that the system could not be used for the expression of non-viral glycoproteins. coronavirus minigenomes have been used for expression of heterologous proteins in piglets [20] and active gamma-interferon in embryonated chicken eggs [ inant proteins found in egg white that has a high ovalbumin concentration. manipulation of the seV minigenome involves very simple steps. expression of these recombinant proteins in the allantoic fluid also facilitates the purification steps. an analogous rVV expressing HMPV/FTM- was obtained using the procedure of Blasco and Moss. pRB21/HMPV/FTM- was engineered by substituting the amino acid G489 of the F protein by a stop codon. vRB12 lacks most of the gene encoding vp37, the major protein component of the vaccinia virus envelope, and as a result is unable to form extracellular enveloped virions SVec/HA-M, SVec/HRSV/FTM- and SVec/HMPV/FTM- were PCR amplified with primers containing XmaI and EcoRI sites. plasmids were subcloned in XmaI-EcoRI digested SVec/HA-M. rescue of the minigenomes in eggs was achieved by inoculating 200 l of culture supernatant of transfected/infected BSR/T7/5 cells growing in microchamber slides. the embryos were incubated at 34\u00b0C for 48 h, and then transferred to 4\u00b0C. the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked -mouse, -rat, or -rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibodies (GE Healthcare) after washing with 0,05%Tween-20 in PBS, the membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked -mouse, -rat, or -rabbit immunoglobulin secondary antibodies. plasmid obtained using the QuickChange Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) was checked by sequencing. protein purification and electron microscopy HRSV/FTM-NN mutant was purified following procedures used for purification of analogous mutants. 7/5 cells were grown in DMEM10, and G-418 (1 mg/ml) was added every third passage [15] to ensure expression of the T7 polymerase. vaccinia virus (rVV) expressing a soluble form of the HRSV F glycoprotein (FTM-), lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, has been described. rVV-HMPV/FTM- was obtained from the supernatant of infected/transfected CV-1 cells. plasmid HA-M-SVec-36-CB119 (here SVec/HA-M) contains a seV-defective RNA genome cloned under the control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. cells were co-transfected with 7 g of SVec/HA-M, SVec/HRSV/FTM- or SVec/HMPV/FTM- plasmids, along with pGEM-L (3.5 g), pGEM-N (7 g), and pGEM-P/Cstop (7 g) after 24 h at 37\u00b0C the culture medium was harvested, clarified, and kept at -80\u00b0C allantoic fluid was harvested after 16 h in the cold and clarified by low-speed centrifugation. western blot Samples for protein analysis were subjected to 12% SDS-PAGE. membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-linked antibodies. site-directed mutagenesis SVec/HRSV/FTM-NN was obtained by sequential mutagenesis of cleavage site II of HRSV/FTM- with oligonucleotides F387-441+ (5'-CCAATGTAACATTAAGCAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACAACA TC made the recombinant SVec plasmids carrying the FTM- genes and established the expression system.
