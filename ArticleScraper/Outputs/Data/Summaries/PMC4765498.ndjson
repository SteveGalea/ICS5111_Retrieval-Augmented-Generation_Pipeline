{"summary": "the digestive tract is the entry site into the body for orally administered test articles. an irritant test article may lead to local acute lesions at this first site of contact to the body. a distinctive feature of the digestive tract is the high proliferative rate of the epithelium. the INHAND nomenclature and the related diagnostic criteria should represent the future international standard in toxicologic pathology. they represent a consensus of senior toxicologic pathologists and were reviewed by the INHAND-GESC (INHAND-Global Editorial and Steering Committee) the nomenclature system describes lesions that occur in conventional strains of rats and mice. the system describes lesions that occur in conventional strains of rats and mice. oral cavity/pharynx tissue samples may include minor salivary glands, adjacent muscle, bone, teeth, or haired skin. the tongue is comprised of the interlacing bundles of striated muscle interspersed with adipocytes, scant to numerous mast cells, nerves, and vascular tissue lined with a squamous mucosal surface. the esophagus consists of a muscle (tunica muscularis) layer with longitudinal and circular-oriented muscle fibers and a squamous mucosa with a keratinized surface. the physiology of the oral cavity, tongue, and esophagus is related primarily to their function as a conduit for food. the tongue and esophagus are usually protocol-required for microscopic evaluation in all animals from toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. for microscopic evaluation, the tongue may be prepared as a longitudinal histologic section that provides for examination of lingual glands. the esophagus is typically prepared as a cross-section at approximately the location of the thyroid gland. pharynx, tongue, and esophagus rarely reported in mice and rats from toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. this is most likely due to their uncommon occurrence, exclusion of animals with these findings prior to study initiation, and minimal routine sampling of this location in the absence of a gross observation. Cleft palate is a longitudinal defect in bone and mucosa of the midline of the hard palate. diagnostic features Midline space defect in oral mucosa and hard palate. no evidence of trauma. diagnostic features Differential diagnosis Thinning of the muscle and mucosal layers as result of distention of the esophagus with food/bedding material. this condition is typically related to a grossly distended esophagus containing food/bedding material and has also been diagnosed as impaction because of the gross appearance. diversticulum of the esophageal mucosa has been reported in rats. tracheal-esophageal malformation represents one of many teratogenic effects reported in mice with intrauterine exposure to adriamycin. squamous epithelium opens into the esophagus lumen, epithelial connection to the surface mucosa of the esophagus. atrophy, squamous epithelium, epithelium and apoptosis. basal lamina may remain intact (erosion) or in more severe lesions the defect in the mucosa may extend into the muscularis (ulcer) the presence of this neoplasm would preclude diagnosis of an associated erosion/ulcer. apoptosis/necrosis, epithelium: Both types of cell death are present. there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine light microscopic examination. a differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the context of a given study, in particular if it targets mechanistic investigations. certain studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death other than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques. apoptosis/necrosis: both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately. epithelial necrosis usually develops into erosion/ulcer. a separate recording of necrosis as the initial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is still intact. apoptosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination. the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used in the narrative part of the pathology report. degeneration/necrosis is the preferred diagnosis for this esophagus finding. degeneration/necrosis of muscle fibers in the tongue may be related to test article administration. Hyaline is the appropriate term for homogenously eosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red.

Differential diagnoses Infiltrate, inflammatory cell: May occur perivascular, but the vessel wall itself is unaffected. Differential diagnosis Inflammation, neutrophils: Usually associated with tissue and vascular damage resulting in exudative edema. hyperplasia, squamous cell, atypical may have been identified as: Dysplasia; hyperplasia with atypia Modifier: Atypical Histogenesis: Squamous epithelium. growth pattern may be plaque-like, with blunt papillary projections or endophytic. hyperplasia, basal cell: Downgrowth of basal cells is the predominant component; no cellular or cellular atypia. hyperplasia, squamous cell: Thickening of the epithelium with all normally existing layers. histogenesis: Epithelial squamous cells of the mucosa in the oral cavity/pharynx, tongue, and esophagus. diagnostic features Central fibrovascular stalk with multiple finger/frond-like projections covered with variably thick squamous epithelium. papilloma, squamous cell: Generally smaller, well-differentiated cells. presence of prominent stromal component, particularly as a component of a stalk. striated muscle fibers may be present in the periphery. some tumor cells may be elongated with irregular nuclei and/or small and rounded with sparsely granular cytoplasm and chromatin-dense nuclei. granular cell tumor (GCT) of the tongue is rare and has not been previously reported in rodents. the oral cavity/pharynx, tongue, and esophagus are components of the upper alimentary tract. each has a mucosa lined by a stratified squamous epithelium with a keratinized surface. the tongue is comprised of the interlacing bundles of striated muscle interspersed with adipocytes. the squamous mucosa of the tongue surface contains numerous papillae and a large circumvallated papilla. the lateral/ventral surface is a simple stratified squamous mucosa. in the more caudal, ventral area, there are large lymphatic vessels, veins, and ducts from the minor salivary glands. portion of the oral cavity/pharynx may be included with routine nasal or tooth sections required for possible histopathology examination. whole-head fixation (calvarium and brain removed) may be the better approach for consistent examination of required tissues. esophagus may be prepared as a longitudinal histologic section that provides for examination of lingual glands. congenital/developmental lesions in the oral cavity/pharynx, tongue, and esophagus have been rarely reported in mice and rats from toxicity and carcinogenicity studies. this is most likely due to their uncommon occurrence, exclusion of animals with these findings prior to study initiation. adenoma of ectopic sebaceous gland in the gingiva of rats has not been reported. this finding is more likely observed in routine nasal cavity sections that may include teeth and gingival tissue. distention, megaesophagus, dilatation, impaction may be spontaneous/idiopathic. may be secondary to an alteration of the esophageal neuromuscular function or decreased secretion of the salivary glands. diagnostic features Irregular cyst-like extension of the mucosal lumen into or through the muscularis layer in the esophagus. tracheal-esophageal malformation represents one of many teratogenic effects reported in mice. diagnostic features Dilated glands lined by simple squamous epithelium.

Esophageal dilation associated with obstruction occurred in rats administered scopolamine (National Toxicology Program 1997a) this has been described as a spontaneous or idiopathic change (Harkness and Ferguson 1979; Ruben et al. 1983) in rats and also attributed to feeding a powdered food diet (Brown and Hardisty 1990). Esophageal dilation, described as megaesophagus, has also been reported as an induced finding in mice with intrauterine exposure to diethylnitrosamine. in rats secondary to effects of scopolamine on salivary secretion and the swallowing reflex. diversticulum distended with food content. rare developmental defects have been reported for the esophagus. duplication of the esophagus has been reported in an adult male rat as a spontaneous occurrence. tracheal malformation represents one of many teratogenic effects reported in mice with intrauterine exposure to adriamycin. diagnostic features Decreased thickness/cellularity of squamous mucosa of tongue, pharynx or esophagus.

Cellular and nuclear pleomorphism. tumor cells are usually closely associated with minimal separation by a delicate fibrovascular stroma. some tumor cells may be elongated with irregular nuclei and/or small. granular cell tumor (GCT) of the tongue is rare and has not been previously reported in rodents. we are aware of several cases of granular cell tumors in the tongue of Wistar rats (4 females and one male) but are unaware of this neoplasm occurring in the tongue of mice. some tumor cells may be elongated with irregular nuclei and/or small and rounded with sparsely granular cytoplasm and chromatin-dense nuclei. granular cell tumor (GCT) of the tongue is rare and has not been previously reported in rodents. the nonglandular stomach (synonym forestomach) is lined by stratified squamous epithelium. it is separated from the distal glandular stomach by the limiting ridge. it is likely that the squamous mucosa of the esophagus will react to test articles in a similar way. glandular fundus has been generically applied to the human stomach to denote glands containing parietal (oxyntic) and/or chief (zymogenic) cells regardless of anatomic site. pylorus is sometimes used to denote the antrum; however, its use should be limited to designating the portion of the antrum adjoining the gastroduodenal junction. the turnover rate of mucus cells is much faster at around 3 days than oxyntic or parietal cells (about 194 and 54, respectively) the turnover rate of mucus cells is much faster at around 3 days than oxyntic or parietal cells (about 194 and 54, respectively) the mucosa is supported by the connective tissue of the lamina propria and the continuous muscle layer of the muscularis mucosa. the external surface is covered by the serosal membrane. the esophagus enters into the nonglandular region of the rodent stomach. a stomach abnormally distended with food, particularly in a rodent fasted overnight, may indicate that the test article and/or vehicle is inhibiting gastric function. a stomach grossly distended with gas is often an indication in a rodent that there has been a blockage in the upper respiratory tract. trimming of stomach should be undertaken as specified in the goRENI trimming guide. the ratios of parietal and chief cells in the fundic glands and the height of the mucosa vary between lesser and greater curvature. inter-animal variation in trimming needs to be avoided and a sensitivity to topography maintained. squamous cysts are most likely to be of congenital origin. if post-inflammatory extension is the suspected pathogenesis, the pathologist may interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather than a congenital cyst. ectopic differentiation may be a feature of some engineered mice. metaplasia to a pancreatic cell type was reported as part of a hypertrophic gastropathy in a strain of rat. vacuolation, squamous epithelium, in addition to hyperplasia, squamous cell. pathogenesis: Degenerative change in the squamous epithelial cells. may precede necrosis, erosion or ulceration of the nonglandular epithelium. morphological features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) apoptosis/necrosis, epithelium: Both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or immunohistochemistry for caspases. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained sections. apoptosis/necrosis/necrosis, squamous epithelium: Both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. differential diagnoses Apoptosis, squamous epithelium: morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria. there is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately. sa with either partial mucosal penetration (erosion) or full penetration of the mucosa to the muscularis mucosa (ulcer) Ulcers will be associated with acute/chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in submucosa. hemorrhage may be seen with larger ulcers. erosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. it is useful to record erosion/ulcer separately from epithelial necrosis. a deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall. orthokeratotic Thickened keratin layer with nucleated keratinized cells. Differential diagnoses Hyperplasia, squamous cell: Proliferation and thickening of the stratum spinosum. hyperkeratosis occurs often in association with hyperplasia of underlying epithelium. diversticulum, cystic OR atypical, cystic: extension of dilated glands through muscularis mucosae, into submucosa and further in some cases. atrophy, mucosa: Dilated glands may be present as part of the atrophic changes. atrophy may affect one or all cell types. in the fundic glands, it may affect one or more cell types. in the fundic glands, it may affect one or more cell types. atrophy affecting all cell types of the gastric mucosa can be produced by starvation, antrectomy or deletion of the gastrin gene. chronic inflammation and some xenobiotics can cause loss of specific cell types. degeneration will be followed by necrosis, erosion/ulcer of the epithelium, inflammation and/or hemorrhage. degeneration will be followed by necrosis, erosion/ulcer of the epithelium, inflammation and/or hemorrhage. mouse glandular stomach, eosinophilic globules. Note intracellular eosinophilic globules and extracellular eosinophilic crystals. eosinophilic crystals also in epithelial cells that undergo cell death. the eosinophilic granules are similar to those seen in other epithelia e.g. upper and lower respiratory tract or pancreas. they have been shown to be composed of a Ym1/Ym2 a chitinase-like protein that may be produced in response to mucosal irritation. the same term may also be used for a different clinical disorder in humans. is/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present. there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive) or immunohistochemistry for caspases. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained sections. both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria. there is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately. apoptosis and necrosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine light microscopic examination. hyperplasia is often present in the surrounding epithelium. may be associated with foreign bodies (plant fibers) in submucosa. erosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. it is useful to record erosion/ulcer separately from epithelial necrosis. a deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall. histochemical stains and immunochemical markers facilitate further characterization of the change as a metaplastic shift in the mucous secretory phenotype of the cells. Authentic intestinal metaplasia is very rare in rodents but has been induced by PCBs in mice. Amyloid deposition occurs in the stomach mucosa as part of systemic amyloidosis. a number of factors including gender, diet, housing conditions, stress and endocrine status can influence the occurrence of amyloidosis. interstitial mineral occurs predominantly in a band paralleling the parietal cell-rich region of the corpus mucosa. diffuse mineralization of the corpus mucosa may be accompanied by degenerative changes. the infiltrate Pathogenesis: Infiltration of lamina propria and/or submucosa with neutrophils (Infiltrate, neutrophil), eosinophils (Infiltrate, eosinophil), mononuclear cells (Infiltrate, mononuclear cell) without other histological features of inflammation e.g. hemorrhage, edema, fibroplasia. infiltration of cells in lamina propria and/or submucosa with neutrophils (Inflammation, neutrophil) or mononuclear cell (Inflammation, mononuclear cell) or a combination (Inflammation, mixed) with additional histological features of inflammation e.g. hemorrhage, edema, fibroplasia. gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) may occur in certain strains of mice (e.g. BALB/c) non-helicobacter opportunists may colonize the achlorhydric rodent stomach (e.g. gastrin-deficient mice) and invoke a similar chronic inflammatory disease. f. Vascular Lesions Edema and hemorrhage of the stomach are similar to those described for the upper digestive tract. other vascular lesions in the stomach and mesentery are dealt with in the INHAND monograph on the cardiovascular system. cysts lined by well-differentiated squamous epithelium may occur. cysts lined by well-differentiated squamous epithelium and filled with keratin may extend into the submucosa. mitotic activity may be increased. quamous cell hyperplasia is relatively common in oral gavage studies. the modifier \u201creactive\u201d should be used if proliferation of stratified squamous epithelium is associated with or secondary to local erosion, ulcer or inflammation. absence of ulcer or erosion in the plane of section does not preclude the presence of such in adjacent unexamined tissue. basal cell hyperplasia and dysplasia are more frequently associated with chemicals (e.g., butylated hydroxyanisole) that result in neoplasms of the nonglandular mucosa. papillomas extend into the submucosa, but lack of cellular atypia. local inflammatory reactions are common. local inflammatory reactions are common. invasive squamous cell carcinomas may have papillary lesions on luminal surface. the spontaneous papilloma in the nonglandular stomach is a rare event in rats. papillomas occur more often in gavage studies than with other routes of exposure. poorly differentiated type (anaplastic): solid sheets or strands of spindle cells leading to varying degrees of desmoplastic appearance. nuclei are hyperchromatic, enlarged and have prominent nucleoli. papilloma, squamous cell: no evidence of lost basement membrane integrity or invasion and no cellular atypia. many squamous cell carcinomas in the nonglandular stomach are exophytic. the exophytic portion can be papillary resembling papilloma. some chemicals especially when given by gavage cause highly malignant squamous cell carcinomas in rats. tumor type is very rare, and no images were available at point of publication. tumor type is very rare, and no images were available at point of publication. i. Non-neoplastic Proliferative Lesions of the Glandular Stomach Diverticulum. Figure 75. Mouse glandular stomach. Diverticulum. Well-differentiated mucosa present in submucosal to subserosal location. epithelial lining is variable, ranging from single layer cuboidal or columnar cells to complete mucosa. epithelium may show features of regeneration like increased basophilia, increased nucleus-to-cytoplasm ratio and gradual loss of polarity. these structures are typically lined by a simple cuboidal mucus epithelium. focal gastric lesions do not resemble diverticulosis in human colon. they do not appear to be neoplastic, although they create an increased risk of rupture and septic peritonitis. ticula are associated with preexisting mucosal atypical hyperplasia/dysplasia. they are associated with tumor-associated gastric toxins, genetically-engineered mice and chronic Helicobacter pylori infection. atypical diverticula may be associated with atypical hyperplasia and adenoma. proliferation may be manifested as an increase in mucosal thickness or penetration of glands through the muscularis mucosae to the submucosa, tunica muscularis, or serosa forming cystic or glandular diverticula. distinct patterns of hyperplastic changes may arise in the glandular stomach because of the cellular complexity, regional differences in architecture, and selectivity of stimuli. the lesion may progress into an adenoma or adenocarcinoma. metaplasia may arise, characterized by a shift from a neutral mucin phenotype to an intestinal mucin phenotype. this may be associated with a reduction in parietal cells and a presumptive shift in local pH. a cause may be evident (irritating substance, gavage material) enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell hyperplasia is the predominant neuroendocrine cell of the oxyntic mucosa. neuroendocrine cells are argyrophilic (e.g. Grimelius, Servier-Munger stains) adenomatous polyp; polypoid adenoma; exocrine adenoma. adenocarcinoma: Infiltration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria. polarity is maintained. rine cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm separated by thin fibrovascular stroma may be entrapped in the adjoining lamina propria or submucosa. adenomas, as well as atypical hyperplasia, may exhibit some degree of dysplasia and distortion of pre-existing architecture. tubular, papillary, cystic, solid, scirrhous, mucinous, signet ring, undifferentiated. major morphologic types include tubular, papillary, cystic, solid, scirrhous, mucinous, and signet ring. mucin secretion may be present even if poorly differentiated. hyperplasia focal (mucosal) atypical: Limited to the mucosal lining, no infiltrative growth; focal penetration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria or deeper layers may be present but basement membrane always intact. morphologic type may depend on the etiology / carcinogen. cytoplasmic eosinophilia and mild nuclear and cellular pleomorphism may be seen in response to hypergastrinemia following anti-secretory drug treatment. small numbers of normal neuroendocrine cells can be observed in the submucosa. neoplastic neuroendocrine cells in submucosal location indicative of infiltrative growth. growth is intramucosal as nodules of pale staining. small numbers of normal neuroendocrine cells can be observed in the submucosa. small numbers of normal neuroendocrine cells can be observed in the submucosa. fibroma/sarcoma: CD 117 and S-100 negative; interlacing bundles of spindle cells; masson\u2019s trichrome-blue collagen. positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats), CD 117 and S-100 negative; infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic morphology. cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture; spindle- or irregular-shaped nuclei. cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture; spindle- or irregular-shaped nuclei. differential diagnoses Gastrointestinal stromal tumor, malignant: Infiltrative growth; distant metastases may be present. leiomyoma: CD117 negative, desmin positive; interlacing bundles and whorls of uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform nuclei. the question arises whether some conventionally diagnosed rodent stromal tumors were actually GIST. the question arises whether some conventionally diagnosed rodent stromal tumors were actually GIST. experimentally-induced GIST in the glandular stomach of rats and a spontaneous GIST in rat nonglandular stomach have been reported. the question arises whether some conventionally diagnosed rodent stromal tumors were actually GIST. the surface epithelium of the glandular mucosa is a simple columnar mucous epithelium that extends into the gastric pits. the depth of the gastric pit varies based on location in the corpus or antrum. the proportion of fundic glands contributing to the thickness of the corpus mucosa is greatest near the limiting ridge on the greater curvature. the turnover rate of mucus cells is much faster at around 3 days than oxyntic or parietal cells (about 194 and 54, respectively) the turnover rate of mucus cells is much faster at around 3 days than oxyntic or parietal cells (about 194 and 54, respectively) the esophagus enters into the nonglandular region of the rodent stomach. the presence of irritants in the diet may quickly lead to damage and inflammation in this area. the lower pH in the nonglandular stomach when compared to the esophagus may be of major importance. a stomach grossly distended with gas is often an indication in a rodent that there has been a blockage in the upper respiratory tract. the non-distended stomach has an irregularly folded mucosa and submucosa. consistent opening and positioning during fixation are necessary to obtain standardized sections of both glandular corpus and antrum. glandular corpus mucosa may be minimal or absent along the lesser curvature with the antral mucosa extending to the limiting ridge. lesions that may affect the nonglandular and glandular regions in similar manner are described only once. if post-inflammatory extension is the suspected pathogenesis, the pathologist may choose to interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather than a congenital cyst. the pathologist may choose to interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather than a congenital cyst. metaplasia to a pancreatic cell type was reported as part of a hypertrophic gastropathy in a strain of rat (WTC-dfk) ectopic pancreatic tissue also may occur rarely in the pyloric submucosa of mice. diagnostic features Cells of squamous epithelium have a pale staining, vacuolated appearance. may be accompanied by edema in the submucosa and vacuolation of the muscularis. both types of cell death present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. some techniques detect early phases of apoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained slides. apoptosis/necrosis, squamous epithelium: Both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria. there is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately. apoptosis and necrosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine light microscopic examination. ulcers in the nonglandular epithelium are often seen macroscopically as multiple small dark depressed areas surrounded by raised areas of whitened epithelium. the cause of ulceration in control animals is often unclear. a deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall. a perforation resulting from a physical insult, e.g. gavage-related, typically is a macroscopic lesion and generally not recorded on the light microscopic level. hyperkeratosis occurs often in association with hyperplasia of underlying epithelium. it may be observed in the absence of hyperplasia under circumstances suggesting anorexia and a lack of mechanical abrasion. pathogenesis: Dilatation within glands. Lined by well-differentiated flattened epithelial cells. no atypia. Lumen may contain mucus. Luminal contents may be mineralized. may be surrounded by chronic inflammation. atrophy affecting all cell types of the gastric mucosa can be produced by starvation, antrectomy or deletion of the gastrin gene which removes the trophic stimulation of gastrin. chronic inflammation and some xenobiotics can cause loss of specific cell types. degeneration is observed with anticancer cytotoxic agents, ulcerogenic agents and agents that decrease mucosal blood supply, or test articles that sequester in parietal cells. normal \u2013 compare to Figure 54. Rat antral mucosa. Secretory depletion. Same magnification as Figure 53. Pathogenesis: Decreased mucus content of mucous cells. Diagnostic features Intact epithelial layer. Replacement of normal clear cytoplasm with more basophilic cytoplasm containing little or no mucus. eosinophilic globules may be considered a precursor of these crystals. eosinophilic globules are similar to those seen in other epithelia. hyalinosis is a chitinase-like protein that may be produced in response to mucosal irritation. the term hyalinosis may cause confusion in safety assessment. the approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death applied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death Nomenclature Working Group. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and inflammation in necrosis. however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and techniques detect early phases of apoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained sections only. some studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death. both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. it is recommended to explain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the pathology report. erosions and ulcers develop in rodents following stress, bile reflux, changes in acid secretion and hypoxia. ulcers have also been induced by innocuous substances e.g. saline glucose when given as hyperosmolar solutions. a deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall. a perforation resulting from a physical insult typically is a macroscopic lesion. a perforation resulting from a physical insult, e.g. gavage-related, typically is a macroscopic lesion. Authentic intestinal metaplasia is best confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the intestinal-specific nuclear protein Cdx2. pseudopyloric/intestinal metaplasia occurs in the rodent stomach as a change associated with some experimentally induced cancers (e.g. following administration of polychlorinated biphenyls) a number of factors including gender, diet, housing conditions, stress, endocrine status and microbiological status can influence the occurrence of amyloidosis. the previously susceptible CD-1 strain in Europe now rarely develops amyloidosis. corpus mucosa may be accompanied by degenerative changes or mucous cell hyperplasia in neighboring glands. bacterial invasion will be accompanied by necrosis and usually inflammation. postmortem bacterial invasion will be accompanied by autolysis. diagnostic features Focal, multifocal or diffuse infiltration of cells in lamina propria and/or submucosa. presence of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leucocytes but no other histological criteria of inflammation. differential diagnoses Infiltrate, inflammatory cell: Other morphologic features of inflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be absent. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. the progression from infection by H. pylori and H. felis to the formation of gastric adenocarcinoma has been well described. mouse strains such as C57BL/6 that mount a strong Th1 responses to helicobacter infection demonstrate lower colonization but increased inflammation and hyperplasia/dysplasia. non-neoplastic proliferative Lesions of the nonglandular Stomach Hyperplasia, squamous cell focal. 68. Rat nonglandular stomach. hyperplasia squamous cell focal. Higher magnification of Figure 67 indicating maintained polarity of epithelium. squamous epithelium at the border of nonglandular and glandular stomach (limiting ridge) is generally thickened relative to the adjacent squamous mucosa. hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis alone should be distinguished from squamous hyperplasia. nonglandular stomach carcinogens may induce dysplasia of spinous and basal cells, especially if the hyperplasia is a precursor to a papilloma or squamous cell carcinoma. basal cells predominate, keratinization is absent, evidence for lost basement membrane integrity. Isolated nests of basal cells may occur in the lamina propria, dependent on the plane of section through the rete peg structures. squamous epithelium forms a single complex branching fibrovascular core by exophytic tumors. well-differentiated squamous cell layer (orderly maturation of the epithelium), often with prominent hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis. the spontaneous papilloma in the nonglandular stomach is a rare event in rats. papillomas occur more often in gavage studies than with other routes of exposure. papillomas occur more often in gavage studies than with other routes of exposure. papilloma, squamous cell: no evidence of lost basement membrane integrity or invasion and no cellular atypia. papillomas may also extend into the submucosa and displace muscularis mucosa. squamous cell carcinomas may contain mostly basal or spindle cells with little squamous differentiation. these tumors are considered a morphological variant of the more typical squamous cell carcinoma. some chemicals especially when given by gavage cause highly malignant squamous cells carcinomas in rats. tumor type is very rare, and no images were available at point of publication. neoplastic basal cells infiltrate into lamina propria of the mucosa and submucosa. Figure 77. Mouse glandular stomach. Diverticulum. Penetration of muscularis mucosae by well differentiated single-layered epithelium with maintained basement membrane integrity. Figure 78. Mouse glandular stomach. Diverticula, some of them atypical (arrows) hyperplastic atypical epithelial cells forming cystic glands may appear to be \u201cinvading\u201d into deeper layers of the stomach. atypical change often focal in an otherwise normal appearing epithelium with varying degrees of dysplasia. small glandular diverticula lined by a single layer of cuboidal or columnar epithelium resemble \"crypt herniation\" of human gastrointestinal pathology. crypt herniation of crypts through the muscularis mucosae is interpreted as \"pseudoinvasive\" atypical diverticula may be associated with atypical hyperplasia and adenoma, but usually not with adenocarcinoma. they should not be recorded as a separate diagnostic entity when associated with another proliferative process. submucosa, tunica muscularis, or serosa forming cystic or glandular diverticula. eosinophilic globules may be present in epithelial cell cytoplasm. mitoses may be increased. atypical proliferations resembling morphologically an invasive adenocarcinoma have been found in specific genetically modified mouse lines and after chemical induction. they have been termed gastric intraepithelial Neoplasia (GIN) Diffuse hyperplasia may be induced by chemicals (e.g. Misprostal) or by larval (Taenia taeniaeformis) infestation in the liver. a cause may be evident (irritating substance, gavage material) neuroendocrine cells are argyrophilic (e.g. Grimelius, Servier-Munger stains) and immunohistochemically positive for neuron-specific enolase, chromogranin A, histidine decarboxylase, and histamine. epithelial nuclei are unilayered or organized with varying degree of stratification. cells are a basophilic, less differentiated glandular epithelium, but with little atypia; polarity is maintained. an adenoma must possess a polypoid, sessile or papillary growth pattern. an adenoma must possess a polypoid, sessile or papillary growth pattern. an adenoma must possess a polypoid, sessile or papillary growth pattern. major morphologic types include tubular, papillary, cystic, solid, scirrhous, mucinous, and signet ring. cytologic and nuclear atypia, anaplasia, hyperchromatism, basophilic or clear cytoplasm, and increased mitotic figures. adenocarcinomas are uncommon spontaneous tumors in rodents except of some genetically modified mouse strains. the morphologic type may depend on the etiology / carcinogen. the enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cell is the predominant neuroendocrine cell of the oxyntic mucosa. Discrete, well-demarcated aggregates of neuroendocrine cells may arise from hyperplastic areas in the oxyntic mucosa (i.e. corpus region) neoplastic neuroendocrine cells in submucosal location indicative of infiltrative growth. growth is intramucosal as nodules of pale staining or eosinophilic cells. Discrete foci are less than 3 gastric glands in diameter. endocrine cells can be observed in the submucosa and should not be classified as neoplasia. endocrine cells can be observed in the submucosa and should not be categorized as neoplasia. histiocytic sarcoma: positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats), CD 117 and S-100 negative; interlacing bundles of spindle cells; masson\u2019s trichrome-blue collagen. infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic morphology. sarcoma: CD117 negative, S-100 positive; interlacing bundles of spindle cells. nuclei sometime arranged in palisades (i.e., Antoni A pattern) rls of uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform nuclei. phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin positive myofibrils; indistinct cell borders; nuclei sometime arranged in palisades. experimentally-induced GIST in glandular stomach of rats and a spontaneous GIST in rat nonglandular stomach. specialized smooth muscle cells (i.e. interstitial cells of Cajal) in tunica muscularis or myenteric plexus. cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture, myxoid areas may be present. experimentally-induced GIST in the glandular stomach of rats and a spontaneous GIST in rat nonglandular stomach have been reported. the question arises whether some conventionally diagnosed rodent stromal tumors were actually GIST. squamous cysts are most likely to be of congenital origin. if post-inflammatory extension is the suspected pathogenesis, the pathologist may interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather than a congenital cyst. metaplasia to a pancreatic cell type was reported as part of a hypertrophic gastropathy in a strain of rat. ectopic pancreatic tissue also may occur rarely in the pyloric submucosa of mice. squamous cysts are most likely to be of congenital origin they may potentially form during life secondary to derangement of the epithelium. if post-inflammatory extension is the suspected pathogenesis, the pathologist may choose to interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather than a congenital cyst. diagnostic features Normally formed pancreatic acini in mucosa or submucosa. Islets of Langerhans may also be present. hepatocytes present in cords or nests in mucosa or submucosa. formation of hepatocyte-like cells has been reported in human gastric adenocarcinoma. ectopic differentiation may be a feature of some engineered mice. ial diagnoses Erosion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe cases (ulcer) of all epithelial layers. Excessive stretching due to food contents or stretching stomach at necropsy leads to decreased thickness of all layers of the gastric wall. pathogenesis: Degenerative change in the squamous epithelial cells which precede necrosis, erosion or ulceration of the nonglandular epithelium. apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and inflammation. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or immunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. in more severe cases, there may be detachment of the epithelium from the submucosa. minimal or slight inflammatory cell infiltrates may be present as a feature of necrosis. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis. apoptosis, squamous epithelium: morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria. there is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately. apoptosis and necrosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination. pathogenesis: Localized loss of mucosa with either partial mucosal penetration (erosion) or with full penetration of the mucosa to the muscularis mucosa. Ulcers will be associated with acute/chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in submucosa. erosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. it is useful to record erosion/ulcer separately from epithelial necrosis. a deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall. otic, parakeratotic Pathogenesis: Keratinization of squamous epithelium faster than desquamation of keratinized layers with normal (hyperkeratotic) or abnormal (parakeratotic) maturation of the keratin layers Diagnostic features Increase in the thickness of the keratin layer on the luminal epithelial surface. excessive stretching due to food contents leads to decreased thickness of all layers of the gastric wall. Diagnostic features Focally extensive or diffuse lesion. Decreased thickness of mucosal epithelial layer. Differential diagnoses Erosion/ulcer. certain compounds may specifically cause vacuolation of the squamous epithelium adjacent to the limiting ridge. apoptosis, squamous epithelium Synonyms: Apoptotic cell death Pathogenesis: Gene regulated, energy dependent process leading to formation of apoptotic bodies. the approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death applied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death Nomenclature Working Group. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and inflammation in necrosis. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained slides only. some studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death other than apoptosis. necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine light microscopic examination. a differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required. some confirmatory techniques detect early phases of apoptosis. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis (cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.) morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis. sion/ulcer: Focal or focally extensive absence of superficial or, in severe cases, of all epithelial layers with distention of alteration into the muscularis. separate recording of necrosis as the initial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is still intact. a separate recording of necrosis as the initial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is still intact. apoptosis/necrosis, squamous epithelium Synonym: Cell death Pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammatory reaction. Necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination. the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003). this often makes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination. the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. it is recommended to explain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the pathology report. protein restriction and starvation have also been shown to produce ulcers. the plane of section through smaller, focal lesions often impacts on the appearance of this finding. a deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall. squamous epithelial: no superficial or deep loss of epithelial cells. squamous epithelial: no superficial or deep loss of epithelial cells. hyperkeratosis occurs often in association with hyperplasia of underlying epithelium. hyperkeratosis occurs often in association with hyperplasia of underlying epithelium. hyperkeratosis can be a frequent observation attributable to local irritation of orally administered test articles in toxicity studies. the local irritant effect is presumably potentiated by increased duration of exposure associated with intragastric storage and increased contact. ular dilatation, glandular dilation Pathogenesis: Dilatation within glands. Diagnostic features Lined by well-differentiated cuboidal to flattened epithelial cells; no atypia. Lumen may contain mucus. Usually multifocal. rhous stromal reaction may be present as part of atrophic changes. cysts may be congenital but most are acquired as their incidence increases with age in rats and mice. atrophy affecting all cell types of the gastric mucosa can be produced by starvation, antrectomy or deletion of the gastrin gene. chronic inflammation and some xenobiotics can cause loss of specific cell types. degeneration is observed with anticancer cytotoxic agents, ulcerogenic agents and agents that decrease mucosal blood supply. Depending on the nature and severity of the insult, degeneration will be followed by necrosis, erosion/ulcer of the epithelium, inflammation and/or hemorrhage. administration of histamine H2 receptor antagonists and proton pump inhibitors has also been shown to reduce total and sulphated glycoproteins along with reduction in mucus. eosinophilic globules also in epithelial cells that undergo cell death. eosinophilic globules may be considered a precursor of these crystals. formation of these cells is also associated with the administration of gastric antisecretory agents. formation of these cells is also associated with the administration of gastric agents. morphological features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) apoptosis/necrosis/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or immunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis. apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present. diagnostic features Both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. epithelial cells are absent but muscolaris mucosa is intact (erosion) Ulceration will be associated with acute/chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in submucosa. hemorrhage may be seen with larger ulcers. a deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall, and may be designated as such by a free text entry. a perforation resulting from a physical insult, e.g. gavage-related, typically is a macroscopic lesion. alcian blue/PAS pH 2.5 shows that cells express increased gastric-type neutral mucins (red) as well as antral gland and intestinal-type acid mucins (blue) differential diagnosis None. evaluation limits the characterization of this mucosal change to hypertrophy or hyperplasia. Amyloid deposition may occur in the stomach mucosa as part of systemic amyloidosis but it is not one of the predilection sites. the previously susceptible CD-1 strain in Europe now rarely develops amyloidosis. minerals can be found in muscle, fibrous or elastic tissues secondary to necrosis (dystrophic mineralization) or hypercalcemia (metastatic mineralization). mineralization can sometimes be observed in combination with inflammation and neoplasia. tation, glands. Figure 49. Rat glandular stomach. Dilatation glands. Higher magnification of Figure 48; note well differentiated cuboidal epithelium. Diagnostic features Lined by well-differentiated cuboidal to flattened epithelial cells; no atypia. Lumen may contain mucus. Usually multifocal. pathogenesis: Dilatation within glands. Lined by well-differentiated flattened epithelial cells. no atypia. Lumen may contain mucus. Luminal contents may be mineralized. may be surrounded by chronic inflammation. cysts may be congenital but most are acquired as their incidence increases with age in both rats and mice. pathogenesis: Decreased number and/or size of epithelial cells reducing. atrophy affecting all cell types of the gastric mucosa can be produced by starvation, antrectomy or deletion of the gastrin gene. chronic inflammation and some xenobiotics can cause loss of specific cell types. atrophy affecting all cell types of the gastric mucosa can be produced by starvation, antrectomy or deletion of the gastrin gene which removes the trophic stimulation of gastrin. chronic inflammation and some xenobiotics can cause loss of specific cell types. pathogenesis: Vacuolation with/without degeneration of epithelial cells. may affect all cell types or be primarily chief, parietal or mucous cell. diagnostic features Cytoplasmic vacuolation, swelling. Occasional Apoptosis/single cell necrosis may also be present. degeneration is observed with anticancer cytotoxic agents, ulcerogenic agents and agents that decrease mucosal blood supply, or test articles that sequester in parietal cells. degeneration will be followed by necrosis, erosion/ulcer of the epithelium, inflammation and/or hemorrhage. diagnostic features Intact epithelial layer. Replacement of normal clear cytoplasm with more basophilic cytoplasm containing little or no mucus. atrophy, mucous cell: Reduced number of mucus cells. mucous epithelial cells distended with bright, hyaline eosinophilic cytoplasm. eosinophilic globules may be considered a precursor of these crystals. hyalinosis is a chitinase-like protein that may be produced in response to mucosal irritation. the same term may also be used for a distinctly different clinical disorder in humans. hyalinosis is a chitinase-like protein that may be produced in response to mucosal irritation. the term is used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. the approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death applied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death Nomenclature Working Group. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and inflammation in necrosis. however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained slides only. some studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death other than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques. necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine light microscopic examination. the complex term apoptosis/necrosis may be used in routine toxicity studies. some confirmatory techniques detect early phases of apoptosis. Necrosis, mucosa. Synonyms: Oncotic cell death; oncotic necrosis; necrosis Modifiers: Single cell Pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammatory reaction. epithelial necrosis usually develops into erosion/ulcer. a separate recording of necrosis as the initial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is still intact. a separate recording of necrosis as the initial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is still intact. apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa Synonym: Cell death Pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue. combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. it is recommended to explain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the pathology report. epithelial cells are absent but muscolaris mucosa is intact (ulcer) Ulceration will be associated with acute/chronic inflammatory cell infiltration in submucosa. hemorrhage may be seen with larger ulcers. small focal erosions can occur in the glandular corpus of rats and mice following overnight fasting. the plane of section through smaller, focal lesions often impacts on the appearance (depth of the epithelial loss) of this finding. erosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. erosions and ulcers develop in rodents following stress, bile reflux, changes in acid secretion and hypoxia. ulcers have also been induced by innocuous substances e.g. saline glucose when given as hyperosmolar solutions. a deep ulcer may be perforating if it destroys all layers of the gastric wall. a perforation resulting from a physical insult typically is a macroscopic lesion. the mucous cells may manifest foamy cytoplasm. True intestinal metaplasia (metaplasia with development of a genuine intestinal phenotype) is very rare in rodents but has been induced by PCBs in mice. Authentic intestinal metaplasia is best confirmed by immunohistochemistry. metaplasia occurs in the rodent stomach as a change associated with some experimentally induced cancers (e.g. following administration of polychlorinated biphenyls), localized ionizing radiation, injection of xenogenic stomach antigens and the non carcinogen, iodoacetamide (Greaves 2012), and infectious models in mice such as H. felis and H. pylori. diagnostic features Deposition of pale amorphous, homogenous eosinophilic material. location is extracellular in connective tissue and/or blood vessel walls. Amyloid deposition may occur in the stomach mucosa as part of systemic amyloidosis but it is not one of the predilection sites. a number of factors including gender, diet, housing conditions, stress, endocrine status and microbiological status can influence the occurrence of amyloidosis. mucosal mineralization can be limited to small focal deposits. diffuse mineralization of the corpus mucosa may be accompanied by degenerative changes or mucous cell hyperplasia in neighboring glands. mineralization occurs secondary to chronic renal disease in rodents. mineralization can sometimes be observed in combination with inflammation and neoplasia. edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be present. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. inflammation in the both glandular and nonglandular stomach is most often seen in combination with erosion or ulceration. edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be present. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. a minimal/mild infiltration of eosinophilic leucocytes is common in the submucosa of the corpus of rats. the infiltrate may also extend into the non-glandular region near the limiting ridge. inflammation in the glandular and nonglandular stomach is most often seen in combination with erosion or ulceration. diagnostic features Focal, multifocal or diffuse infiltration of cells in lamina propria and/or submucosa. achlorhydric rodent stomach invokes a similar chronic inflammatory disease. the progression from infection by H. pylori and H. felis to formation of gastric adenocarcinoma in various mouse strains has been well described. infection by H. felis and H. pylori in some strains of mice results in inflammatory, dysplastic and eventually neoplastic changes. proliferation of gut associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) may occur in certain strains of mice (e.g. BALB/c) non-helicobacter opportunists may colonize the achlorhydric rodent stomach (e.g. gastrin-deficient mice) and invoke a similar chronic inflammatory disease. Host immunity plays a crucial role in determining the outcome of gastric helicobacter infection. a variety of similar organisms have been reported in many species. these organisms usually are not pathogenic but may be under specific conditions such as immunodeficiency. Associated inflammation is usually not observed but may be seen. Modifier: Reactive Diagnostic features Proliferation and thickening of the stratum spinosum, often in association with a thickened keratin layer (parakeratotic or hyperkeratotic). Broad-based hyperplastic foci might have multiple straight or minimally branched projections. squamous epithelium at the border of nonglandular and glandular stomach is generally thickened relative to the adjacent squamous mucosa. this area may be folded and, thus, cut tangentially or obliquely, if the stomach was not properly stretched prior to fixation. hyperkeratosis or parakeratosis alone should be distinguished from squamous hyperplasia. lesion is considered to originate from nonglandular stomach. it should be collected under the term \"nonglandular stomach, hyperplasia, basal cell\" basal cells hyperplasia and dysplasia are more frequently associated with chemicals (e.g., butylated hydroxyanisole) that result in neoplasms of the nonglandular mucosa. keratinization within the basal layer may be observed. polarity of differentiation to keratinocytes is orderly and complete. papillary body may show undulation due to enlarged germinal layers. cysts lined by well-differentiated squamous epithelium may extend into the submucosa. anthosis is a synonym for hyperplasia of the squamous cell epithelium of the skin. the modifier should be used if proliferation of stratified squamous epithelium is associated with or secondary to local erosion, ulcer or inflammation. the absence of an ulcer or erosion in the plane of section does not preclude the presence of such in adjacent unexamined tissue. papillary body may show undulation due to enlarged germinal layers. cysts lined by well-differentiated squamous epithelium and filled with keratin may extend into the submucosa. mitotic activity may be increased. the modifier should be used if proliferation of stratified squamous epithelium is associated with or secondary to local erosion, ulcer or inflammation. the absence of an ulcer or erosion in the plane of section does not preclude the presence of such in adjacent unexamined tissue. nonglandular stomach carcinogens may induce dysplasia of spinous and basal cells. basal cells predominate, keratinization is absent, evidence for lost basement membrane integrity. dysplasia of basal cells, characterized by keratinization within the basal layer, may be observed. differential diagnoses Hyperplasia, squamous cell: Thickening of the epithelium with all normally existing layers. keratinized cells proliferate, cellular atypia. papillomas extend into the submucosa, but lack of cellular atypia. local inflammatory reactions are common. local inflammatory reactions are common. invasive squamous cell carcinomas may have papillary lesions on luminal surface. the spontaneous papilloma in the nonglandular stomach is a rare event in rats. papillomas occur more often in gavage studies than with other routes of exposure. poorly differentiated type (anaplastic): solid sheets or strands of spindle cells leading to varying degrees of desmoplastic appearance. nuclei are hyperchromatic, enlarged and have prominent nucleoli. superficial ulceration and inflammation or fibroplasia of the lamina propria or submucosa are common features. many squamous cell carcinomas in the nonglandular stomach are exophytic. the exophytic portion can be papillary resembling papilloma. chemically-induced squamous cell carcinomas may contain mostly basal or spindle cells with little squamous differentiation. tumor type is very rare, and no images were available at point of publication. tumor type is very rare, and no images were available at point of publication. papillomas extend into the submucosa, but no evidence for lost basement membrane integrity. squamous cell carcinomas may extend into the submucosa. invasive squamous cell carcinomas may have papillary lesions on luminal surface. spontaneous papilloma in the nonglandular stomach is a rare event in rats. papillomas occur more often in gavage studies than with other routes of exposure. invasive squamous cell carcinomas may have papillary lesions on luminal surface. the spontaneous papilloma in the nonglandular stomach is a rare event in rats. papillomas occur more often in gavage studies than with other routes of exposure. poorly differentiated type (anaplastic): solid sheets or strands of spindle cells leading to varying degrees of desmoplastic appearance; keratinization may be difficult to detect. cells show varying size (frequently larger than normal) and shape; nuclei are hyperchromatic, enlarged and have prominent nucleoli. papillomas may extend into the submucosa and displace muscularis mucosa. the presence of carcinomatous foci in an otherwise benign appearing papilloma is indicative of malignancy. many squamous cell carcinomas in the nonglandular stomach are exophytic. poorly differentiated type (anaplastic): solid sheets or strands of spindle cells leading to varying degrees of desmoplastic appearance; keratinization may be difficult to detect. nuclei are hyperchromatic, enlarged and have prominent nucleoli. superficial ulceration and inflammation of the lamina propria or submucosa are common features. squamous cell carcinomas may contain mostly basal or spindle cells with little squamous differentiation. some chemicals especially when given by gavage cause highly malignant squamous cell carcinomas in rats which metastasize to the peritoneal cavity and lungs. the absence of differentiation and therefore the predominant proliferation of the basal cell is a criterion for the basal cell tumor diagnosis. this tumor type is very rare, and no images were available at point of publication. differential diagnoses Carcinoma, squamous cell: Well differentiated squamous cell carcinomas with prominent keratinization. poorly differentiated variants can have a prominent basal cell component but this is generally associated with extensive invasion and a scirrhous response. tumor type is very rare, and no images were available at point of publication. i. non-neoplastic proliferative Lesions of the Glandular Stomach Diverticulum. atypical cystic hyperplasia;

Indistinct cell borders and fibrillary cytoplasm. Spin experimentally-induced GIST in the glandular stomach of rats and a spontaneous GIST in rat nonglandular stomach have been reported. the question arises whether some conventionally diagnosed rodent stromal tumors were actually GIST. omas of the antral mucosa may be retained but basement membrane is always intact. cells are a basophilic, less differentiated glandular epithelium, but with little atypia. epithelial nuclei are unilayered or organized with varying degree of stratification. an intra-epithelial small focus with cytological characteristics should NOT be diagnosed as an adenoma but as atypical hyperplasia. an intra-epithelial small focus with cytological characteristics seen in adenomas should NOT be diagnosed as an adenoma but as atypical hyperplasia. adenomas, as well as atypical hyperplasia, may exhibit some degree of dysplasia and distortion of pre-existing architecture. adenoma must possess a polypoid, sessile or papillary growth pattern, whether grossly visible or not. tubular, papillary, cystic, solid, scirrhous, mucinous, signet ring, undifferentiated. morphologic types include tubular, papillary, cystic, solid, scirrhous, mucinous, and signet ring. hyperplasia focal (mucosal) atypical: Limited to the mucosal lining, no infiltrative growth; focal penetration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria or deeper layers may be present but basement membrane always intact. morphologic type may depend on the etiology / carcinogen. cytologic and nuclear atypia, anaplasia, hyperchromatism, basophilic or clear cytoplasm, and increased mitotic figures. invasive growth may elicit fibrous/scirrhous reaction and inflammation, i.e. areas of infiltration are surrounded by loose stroma. gastric adenocarcinomas are uncommon spontaneous tumors in rodents except of some genetically modified mouse strains. the morphologic type may depend on the etiology / carcinogen. diagnostic features Discrete, well-demarcated aggregates of neuroendocrine cells. size of the aggregates exceeds 3 gastric glands in diameter. Compression or necrosis of adjoining mucosa glands may be observed. neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia and neoplasia may be seen in response to hypergastrinemia following anti-secretory drug treatment. small numbers of normal neuroendocrine cells can be observed in submucosa. growth is intramucosal as nodules of pale staining or eosinophilic cells. infiltration through muscularis mucosae by neoplastic, often less-differentiated, cells arranged in cords or nodules. metastasis to regional lymph nodes or liver may be present.

Differential diagnosis None; however, it is necessary to verify the location of the intestinal specimen because Paneth cell density varies based on topography. paneth cells showed increased expression of \u00df-catenin. paneth cell differentiation is also seen in tumors that develop in this model. Vacuoles that contain neutral lipids stain positive with oil red O and Sudan Black. lipid droplets were described where an ester of erythromycin was administered. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting in foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. in the intestines, changes due to phospholipidosis are most commonly observed in macrophages. epithelial cells, myocytes and neuronal ganglia can also be affected. the intestines are likely to be one of the more severely affected sites following oral administration of a test article. degeneration and necrosis of the glands is followed by disruption of the basement membrane leading to dilation of the glands and a neutrophilic inflammatory reaction. dilated Brunner\u2019s glands lined with flattened atrophic epithelium are observed. small intestine due to the accumulation of large lipid droplets was described in rats administered indole-3-carbinol, possibly due to an impairment of lipid transport in the lacteals. the epithelial cells were unaffected. apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages. the complex term apoptosis/necrosis may be used in routine toxicity studies. a differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the context of a given study. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis. apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately. rosis usually develops into erosion/ulcer and in the past has frequently been recorded as such. a separate recording of necrosis as the initial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is still intact. the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. it is recommended to explain in detail the use in the narrative part of the pathology report. ionizing radiation produces acute lesions followed by fibrosis and arteriolar sclerosis (Langberg and Hauer-Jensen 1996; Haschek et al. 2010). some viral and bacterial infections may induce erosion and ulceration. Amyloidosis is extremely rare in rats but common in some strains of mice. a number of factors including sex, diet, housing conditions, stress, endocrine status and microbiological status can influence the occurrence of amyloidosis. mucosal mineralization can be limited to small focal deposits. colonic and rectal mucosa may be confused with mineral due to their basophilic staining. dilation of the lumen is observable macroscopically. mucosa, submucosa and muscularis are thin due to stretching. degeneration of muscle fibers and ganglia cells in the nerve plexus may be present. administered intraperitoneally as an anesthetic has been associated with ileus in rodents. diagnostic features Observable macroscopically. invagination of a portion of intestine into its immediate distal section. diagnostic features Observable macroscopically. Eversion of rectum through the anus. microscopic lesions of mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage, edema and inflammation. Differential diagnosis None. diagnostic features Focal, multifocal or diffuse infiltration of cells in the lamina propria and/or submucosa. edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be present. the most likely cause for inflammatory lesions in barrier maintained rodents is the administration of test articles. hypersensitivity reactions may play a role in test article induced inflammatory reactions, for example trinitobenezensulfonic acid acts as hapten. intestinal parasites present in barrier-reared and maintained rodents. if there has been a barrier breakdown or in immunodeficient animals. the most likely nematodes to be seen in the event of a barrier break down in a rodent unit are the pinworms Syphacia muris, Syphacia obvelata and/or Aspicularis tetrapertera. the reader is referred to standard texts for a full list of intestinal parasites that may be present in non-barrier maintained or wild rodents. Cystic adenomatous hyperplasia; diverticulosis; herniated crypt; crypt herniation Diverticulum, atypical, may have been identified as: atypical cystic hyperplasia; cystic hyperplasia with growth into the gastric wall; cystic adenomatous hyperplasia; herniation, atypical; \u201cpseudoinvasion\u201d, atypical Modifiers: Cystic diversticula do not appear to be neoplastic, although they create an increased risk of rupture and septic peritonitis. crypt herniation of crypts through the muscularis mucosa is interpreted as 'pseudoinvasive' or 'inverted' growth pattern. atypical diverticula may be associated with atypical hyperplasia and adenoma, but usually not with adenocarcinoma. atypical diverticula must be distinguished from genuine neoplastic invasion (e.g. loss of basement membrane and other signs of malignancy in the latter) atypical structure of the intestinal villi and crypts often abnormal. crypts exhibit normal length or are enlaged. no evidence of compression. lasias often follow injury due to chemicals, infectious agents and irradiation. hyperplasia occurs in the distal colon of mice infected with the gram negative bacterium Citrobacter freundii (transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia) dilated mucosal glands can extend towards the submucosa and be interspersed with dilated Brunner\u2019s glands. the term GIN or dysplasia has been used in genetically-engineered mice. it has not been described in untreated wild type animals so far. Brunner\u2019s glands cells are often hypertrophic with more extensive cytoplasm, larger nuclei, or both. Glands are more branched and coiled, compared with normal glandular structure. metaplasia is often seen in chronic colitis models in mice. squamous cell carcinomas have not been reported to arise in the lesions. higher magnification of Figure 138 demonstrating irregular growth pattern and moderate cellular atypia. atypical signs include cellular basophilia, loss of cellular polarity, hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei. epithelial lining is variable, ranging from single layer cuboidal to columnar cells to complete mucosa. epithelium may show features of regeneration like increased basophilia, increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and gradual loss of polarity. neoplasms develop dysplastic foci and evolve into malignant neoplasms. the cytology of a non-invasive adenoma may include high grade dysplasia. the cytology of a non-invasive adenoma is unusual. scirrhous-producing cells may be interspersed between absorptive cells. mucus may be present intracellularly or extracellularly. squamous metaplasia and focal mineralization are not present. adenocarcinomas show a predilection for the small intestine, especially the jejunum and ileum, rather than the large intestine. induced adenocarcinomas have their preferred localization in the distal colon and show high invasiveness combined with a low tendency to metastasize. attenuated glandular cells may line cystic areas that contain mucus. invasion through the muscularis mucosa and/or through the circular and longitudinal muscles can be extensive. basement membrane of the glands is breached or not evident. leiomyoma shows mitotic activity and cellular pleomorphism. eosinophilic cytoplasm contains longitudinal myofilaments and perinuclear clear space. tiocytic sarcoma is positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats, Factor 4/80 in mice), CD 117 and S-100 negative; infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic morphology. leiomyosarcoma is more pleomorphic and with mitotic activity. histiocytic sarcoma: positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats), CD 117 and S-100 negative. infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic morphology. leiomyoma: CD117 negative, desmin positive; interlacing bundles and whorls of uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform nuclei. minimal nuclear pleomorphism; phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin positive myofibrils. leiomyoma: CD117 negative, desmin positive; interlacing bundles and whorls of uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform nuclei. phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin positive myofibrils; indistinct cell borders; nuclei sometime arranged in palisades. stromal tumors (e.g., leiomyoma) previously were GIST. the small intestine in rodents is subdivided into duodenum, jejunum and ileum. the large intestine is composed of cecum, colon and rectum. the villous epithelium is composed of tall columnar cells with surface microvilli, goblet cells containing mucus and scattered neuroendocrine cells covering a lamina propria composed of connective tissue with a rich vascular and lymphatic network. the lamina propria contains variable numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, eosinophils and/or mast cells. aggregations of lymphoid tissue (Peyer\u2019s patches) are located opposite the mesenteric attachment. similar aggregations are present in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract. in mice and rats the folds of the proximal colon have a distinctive spiral orientation. the enteric nervous system in the intestine is in the form of the submucosal and myenteric plexi. the latter being located between the longitudinal and circular layers of the tunica muscularis. the small intestine is the primary site for absorption of test articles given orally. the entire intestine can be opened, lesion location and size recorded. the whole length of the intestine can be fixed using the Swiss roll method. however, opening the intestine and washing away contents with normal saline brings the risk of damaging the delicate mucosa which degenerates quickly due to post mortem autolysis. pathogenesis: Presence of a cyst lined by squamous cells in the mucosa, muscularis or serosa. squamous cysts were observed very occasionally in the muscularis of the colon and rectum of B6C3F1 mice. diagnostic features Villi show reduced height but increased width. reduced depth of crypts in small intestine and mucous glands in large intestine. reduced mitotic rate and/or increased cell loss through apoptosis. if there is a sustained effect on proliferation e.g. with cytotoxic agents, the atrophy will be followed by erosion/ulceration, hemorrhage and secondary infection. mucosal atrophy induced by agents that interfere with spindle apparatus may also show nuclear abnormalities including karyomegaly. Villous length can also be influenced by nutritional factors e.g. amount of dietary fiber. Diagnostic features Reduced numbers of granules in Paneth cells and/or loss of Paneth cells. Differential diagnosis None. paneth cells in the large intestinal mucosa showed increased expression of \u00df-catenin. paneth cell differentiation is also seen in tumors that develop in this model. y cytoplasm Differential diagnoses Hypertrophy or hyperplasia, mucous cell: Presence of mucins can be confirmed by additional stains (PAS and alcian blue) a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting in foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. changes due to phospholipidosis are most commonly observed in macrophages. epithelial cells, myocytes and neuronal ganglia can also be affected. the intestines are likely to be one of the more severely affected sites following oral administration of a phospholipidosis-inducing test article. degeneration and necrosis of the glands is followed by disruption of the basement membrane leading to dilation of the glands. inflammation extends into the surrounding mucosa and muscle layers. dilated glands lined with flattened atrophic epithelium are observed. giectasis in the small intestine due to the accumulation of large lipid droplets was described in rats administered indole-3-carbinol, possibly due to an impairment of lipid transport in the lacteals. the epithelial cells were unaffected (Boyle et al. 2012). apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages. necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine light microscopic examination. a differentiation between apoptosis and single cell necrosis may be required in the context of a given study. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis. apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa: Both types of cell death are present. there is no requirement to record them separately. a separate recording of necrosis as the initial event in this process is recommended when the structure of the mucosa is still intact. apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa Synonym: Cell death Pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue. the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. it is recommended to explain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the pathology report. acute erosion and ulceration of the distal small intestine has been described. ionizing radiation produces acute lesions followed by fibrosis. some viral and bacterial infections may induce erosion and ulceration. Amyloidosis is extremely rare in rats but common in some strains of mice in which the lamina propria of the intestinal villi is a common site for deposition of amyloid. the previously susceptible CD-1 strain in Europe now rarely develops amyloidosis. mucosal mineralization can be limited to small focal deposits. bacterial invasion will be accompanied by necrosis and usually inflammation. postmortem bacterial invasion will be accompanied by autolysis. dilation of the lumen is observable macroscopically. mucosa, submucosa and muscularis are thin due to stretching. degeneration of muscle fibers and ganglia cells in the nerve plexus may be present. bromoethanol (Avertin) administered intraperitoneally as an anesthetic has been associated with ileus in rodents. diagnostic features Observable macroscopically. invagination of a portion of intestine into its immediate distal section. pathogenesis: Eversion of rectum through the anus. microscopic lesions of mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage, edema and inflammation. differential diagnosis None. diagnostic features Focal, multifocal or diffuse infiltration of cells in the lamina propria and/or submucosa. edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be present. the most likely cause for inflammatory lesions in barrier maintained rodents is the administration of test articles. hypersensitivity reactions may play a role in test article induced inflammatory reactions, for example trinitobenezensulfonic acid acts as hapten. if there has been a barrier breakdown or in immunodeficient animals. the reader is referred to standard texts for a full list of intestinal protozoan. the most likely nematodes to be seen in the event of a barrier break down in a rodent unit are the pinworms Syphacia muris, Syphacia obvelata and/or Aspicularis tetrapertera. the reader is referred to standard texts for a full list of intestinal parasites that may be present in non-barrier maintained or wild rodents. Cystic adenomatous hyperplasia; diverticulosis; herniated crypt; crypt herniation Diverticulum, atypical, may have been identified as: cystic hyperplasia; cystic hyperplasia with growth into the gastric wall; cystic hyperplasia; herniation, atypical; \u201cpseudoinvasion\u201d, atypical Modifiers: Cystic, atypical Pathogenesis: al cells forming cystic glands may appear to be \u201cinvading\u201d into deeper layers of the intestine. diversticula do not appear to be neoplastic, although they create an increased risk of rupture and septic peritonitis. atypical diverticula may be associated with atypical hyperplasia and adenoma, but usually not with adenocarcinoma. atypical diverticula may be associated with atypical hyperplasia and adenoma, but usually not with adenocarcinoma. atypical structure of the intestinal villi and crypts often abnormal. crypts exhibit normal length; crypts exhibit normal length or are enlaged. hyperplasia is seen in the cecum, colon and rectum of mice infected with the gram negative bacterium Citrobacter freundii. the surface epithelium is covered by myriads of cocobacillary bacteria. hypertrophy is the recommended term for such lesions. dilated mucosal glands can extend towards the submucosa and be interspersed with dilated Brunner\u2019s glands. the term GIN or dysplasia has been used in genetically-engineered mice. Brunner\u2019s glands cells are often hypertrophic with more extensive cytoplasm, larger nuclei, or both. Glands are more branched and coiled, compared with normal glandular structure. neurotrophic factor rearranged during transfection can occur. it is important to retain the gastroduodenal junction in a manner that allows a comprehensive evaluation of the area of interest. this prevents folding of the stomach and gastroduodenal region that can obscure Brunner\u2019s glands. higher magnification of Figure 138 demonstrating irregular growth pattern and moderate cellular atypia. atypical signs include cellular basophilia, loss of cellular polarity, hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei. epithelial lining is variable, ranging from single layer cuboidal to columnar cells to complete mucosa. epithelium may show features of regeneration like increased basophilia, increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio and gradual loss of polarity. neoplasms develop dysplastic foci and evolve into malignant neoplasms. the detection frequency is highly dependent on the mode of macroscopic examination of the intestines. the determination of the malignancy status of a papillary or polypoid intestinal tumor requires a good fixation and trimming protocol. the cytology of a non-invasive adenoma may include high grade dysplasia. mucus-producing cells may be interspersed between absorptive cells. mucus may be present intracellularly or extracellularly. single tumor cells and groups of cells are interspersed between pre-existing tissues. spontaneous rodent adenocarcinomas show a predilection for the small intestine rather than the large intestine. induced adenocarcinomas have preferred localization in the distal colon and show high invasiveness combined with a low tendency to metastasize. in rats, the mucinous adenocarcinoma induced by some carcinogens commonly metastasizes, predominantly to the lung. cells have well-stained cytoplasm that may be eosinophilic, amphophilic or basophilic. invasion through the muscularis mucosa and/or through the circular and longitudinal muscles, as well as the serosa, can be extensive. eosinophilic cytoplasm contains longitudinal myofilaments and perinuclear clear space and show immunoreactivity for desmin. differentiation from other soft tissue tumors need only be made in cases of intergroup difference. histiocytic sarcoma: positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats), CD 117 and S-100 negative; infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic morphology. histiocytic sarcoma: positive for histiocytic markers (ED-1 for rats), CD 117 and S-100 negative; infiltrative pattern, pleomorphic morphology. leiomyoma: CD117 negative, desmin positive; interlacing bundles and whorls of uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform nuclei. minimal nuclear pleomorphism; phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin positive myofibrils. cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture, myxoid areas may be present. cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture, myxoid areas may be present. the question arises whether conventionally classified stromal tumors (e.g., leiomyoma) previously were actually GIST. diagnostic features Normally formed pancreatic acini in the mucosa or submucosa. squamous cysts were observed very occasionally in the muscularis of the colon and rectum of B6C3F1 mice. they are thought to be associated with focal weakness or discontinuity of the muscularis resulting in herniation through the submucosa and mucosa to the serosa. the pathologist may choose to interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather than a congential cyst. pathogenesis: Presence of a cyst lined by squamous cells in the mucosa, muscularis or serosa. squamous cysts were observed very occasionally in the muscularis of the colon and rectum of B6C3F1 mice. if post-inflammatory extension is the suspected pathogenesis, the pathologist may choose to interpret the focal change as a diverticulum, rather than a congential cyst. pathogenesis: Reduction in size and number of the acini that comprise the Brunner\u2019s glands. may be accompanied by an inflammatory reaction. may be accompanied by fibrosis. villous atrophy can be induced by withdrawal of food, administration of antimitotic cytotoxic agents, secondary to chronic inflammation or following rotavirus infection. villous atrophy can be induced experimentally by hypophysectomy, thyroidectomy and in segments of surgically bypassed intestine. Villi are longer in the duodenum compared to jejunum and ileum. inconsistency of sampling at necropsy could lead to an erroneous diagnosis. pathogenesis: Enlargement of Paneth cells in small intestine. diagnostic features Hypertrophic Paneth cells. may accompany villous atrophy. Paneth cell hyperplasia may also be present. Differential diagnosis None. vacuoles are observed in epithelial cells of the villi and macrophages of the lamina propria. lipid droplets may be found free in the lamina propria. lipid droplets may be found free in the lamina propria. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting in foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. increases in size and number of lysosomes can be identified by histochemistry, immunostains or transmission electron microscopy. in the intestines, changes due to phospholipidosis are most commonly observed in macrophages. Degeneration/necrosis, Brunner\u2019s glands. diagnostic features Degeneration/necrosis of epithelial cells. disorganisation of gland acini with disruption of basement membranes. Glands may be dilated and lined with flattened, atrophic epithelial cells. phangiectasis in the small intestine due to the accumulation of large lipid droplets was described in rats administered indole-3-carbinol. diagnostic features Dilated lacteals present in the villi. subcapsular sinuses of the mesenteric lymph node may also be dilated. lesions are most severe in young mice and are limited to syncytia in adult mice. enteric lesions are rare with infection largely restricted to GALT. apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages. some confirmatory techniques detect early phases of apoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained slides only. apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa: both types of cell death are present. there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) there is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately. chronic lesions will show chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, granulation tissue, fibrosis and regenerative epithelial hyperplasia. ionizing radiation produces acute lesions followed by fibrosis and arteriolar sclerosis. amyloidosis is extremely rare in rats but common in some strains of mice. a number of factors including sex, diet, housing conditions, stress, endocrine status and microbiological status can influence the occurrence of amyloidosis. the term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of extracellular deposits hyaline material in H&E sections. hyaline is also the appropriate term for homogenously eosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red. the intestines are not as susceptible as the glandular mucosa of the stomach. stroma of sarcomas: Osseous metaplasia may be present in stroma of sarcomas. the lesions are characterized by a necrotizing transmural ileitis with necrosis of the mucosa and muscularis, edema and infiltration primarily of mononuclear cells. this is observed following administration of some antibiotics, starches, polyols, lactose, fibers and vehicles which have an osmotic effect. intussusceptions are very rare in barrier maintained rodents. they may occur in animals with intestinal tumors and rarely with high nematode infestations. pathogenesis: Reduction in size and number of Brunner\u2019s glands. diagnostic features Reduction in size and number of the acini that comprise the Brunner\u2019s glands. may be accompanied by an inflammatory reaction. may be accompanied by fibrosis. Differential diagnosis None. villous atrophy can be induced by withdrawal of food, administration of antimitotic cytotoxic agents, secondary to chronic inflammation or following rotavirus infection. villous atrophy can be induced experimentally by hypophysectomy, thyroidectomy and in segments of surgically bypassed intestine. villous atrophy can be induced by withdrawal of food, administration of antimitotic cytotoxic agents, secondary to chronic inflammation or following rotavirus infection. villous atrophy can be induced experimentally by hypophysectomy, thyroidectomy and in segments of surgically bypassed intestine. Villi are longer in the duodenum compared to jejunum and ileum. inconsistency of sampling at necropsy could lead to an erroneous diagnosis. diagnostic features Reduced numbers of granules in Paneth cells and/or loss of Paneth cells. Differential diagnosis None; however, it is necessary to verify the location of the intestinal specimen. hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the Paneth cells, accompanying villous atrophy, were induced experimentally by surgical isolation of ileal loops (Keren et al. 1975). diagnostic features Hypertrophic Paneth cells. May accompany villous atrophy. Paneth cell hyperplasia may also be present. Differential diagnosis None. vacuoles are observed in epithelial cells of the villi and macrophages of the lamina propria. lipid droplets may be found free in the lamina propria. intracytoplasmic lipid in villous epithelial cells has been reported with several xenobiotics. lipid droplets were described where an ester of erythromycin was administered. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting in foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. immunohistochemical staining for lysosomal membrane proteins can clearly distinguish lysosomes from neutral fat vacuole membranes stained immunohistochemically for adipophilin. vacuoles are observed in epithelial cells of the villi, particularly duodenum and jejunum. lipid droplets were described where an ester of erythromycin was administered. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting in foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. the term phospholipidosis should only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved. immunohistochemical staining for lysosomal membrane proteins can clearly distinguish lysosomes from neutral fat vacuole membranes stained immunohistochemically for adipophilin. degeneration/necrosis, Brunner\u2019s glands. Pathogenesis: Degeneration/necrosis, Brunner\u2019s glands. Diagnostic features Degeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells. Disorganisation of gland acini with disruption of basement membranes diagnostic features Degeneration and necrosis of epithelial cells. disorganisation of gland acini with disruption of basement membranes. Glands may be lined with flattened, atrophic epithelial cells. diagnostic features Dilated lacteals are present in the villi. subcapsular sinuses of the mesenteric lymph node may also be dilated. may be accompanied by minimal vacuolation of epithelial cells. intestine due to large lipid droplets was described in rats administered indole-3-carbinol, possibly due to an impairment of lipid transport in the lacteals. the epithelial cells were unaffected (Boyle et al. 2012). epithelial syncytia are common in MHV infection and MHV infection should be considered as an etiological agent when epithelial syncytia are observed. lesions are most severe in young mice and are limited to syncytia in adult mice. both types of cell death present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or immunohistochemistry for caspases. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained sections. the approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death applied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death Nomenclature Working Group. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and inflammation in necrosis. however, other morphologies (e.g. nucelar pyknosis and low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained slides only. some studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death other than apoptosis which requires specific confirmatory techniques. separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. apoptosis/necrosis, mucosa Synonym: Cell death Pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue. there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. Necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination. the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003). this often makes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination. the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. it is recommended to explain in detail the use in the narrative part of the pathology report. ionizing radiation produces acute lesions followed by fibrosis and arteriolar sclerosis. some viral and bacterial infections may induce erosion and ulceration. some viral and bacterial infections may induce erosion and ulceration. inflammatory cell infiltration is present, except in recently formed lesions. chronic lesions will show chronic inflammatory cell infiltration, granulation tissue, fibrosis and regenerative epithelial hyperplasia. ionizing radiation produces acute lesions followed by fibrosis and arteriolar sclerosis. al necrosis is extremely rare in rats but common in some strains of mice. a number of factors including sex, diet, housing conditions, stress, endocrine status and microbiological status can influence the occurrence of amyloidosis. the term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of extracellular deposits hyaline material in H&E sections. hyaline is also the appropriate term for homogenously eosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red. diagnostic features Mineral may be found in muscle layers, blood vessels, basement membranes and/or in the interstitium of mucosa and submucosa. Differential diagnoses Artifact: Hematoxylin stain precipitate. Bacteria: Colonies of bacteria may be confused with mineral due to their basophilic staining. premortem bacterial invasion will be accompanied by necrosis and usually inflammation. osseous metaplasia may be present in stroma of sarcomas. dilation of the lumen is observable macroscopically. mucosa, submucosa and muscularis are thin due to stretching. degeneration of muscle fibers and ganglia cells in the nerve plexus may be present. megacolon as a result of constipation was induced in rats by a calcium channel antagonist. secondary mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage and inflammation were present in some rats. tribromoethanol (Avertin) administered intraperitoneally as an anesthetic has been associated with ileus in rodents. tribromoethanol (Avertin) administered intraperitoneally as an anesthetic has been associated with ileus in rodents. diagnostic features Observable macroscopically. Invagination of a portion of intestine into its immediate distal section. diagnostic features Observable macroscopically. invagination of a portion of intestine may be dilated while distally the lumen may be devoid of contents. diagnostic features Observable macroscopically. Eversion of rectum through the anus. Microscopic lesions of mucosal necrosis, hemorrhage, edema and inflammation. Differential diagnosis None. inflammatory cell Modifiers: type of inflammatory cell that represents the predominant cell type in the infiltrate Pathogenesis: Infiltration of the lamina propria and/or submucosa with neutrophils (Infiltrate, neutrophil), eosinphils (Infiltrate, eosinophil) or mononuclear cells (Infiltrate, mononuclear cell) or a combination (Infiltrate, mixed) without other his type of inflammatory cell that represents the predominant cell type in the inflammation Pathogenesis: Infiltration of the lamina propria and/or submucosa with neutrophils (Inflammation, neutrophil) or mononuclear cell (Inflammation, mononuclear cell) or a combination (Inflammation, mixed) with additional histological features of inflammation e.g. hemorrhage, edema, fibroplasia. inflammatory lesions can be induced by pathogenic bacteria. salmonella, citrobacter freundii, Helicobacter spp or viruses (norovirus, mouse hepatitis virus) if there has been a barrier breakdown or in immunodeficient animals. edema, hemorrhage, necrosis and/or fibroplasia will be present. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. type of inflammatory cell that represents the predominant cell type in the inflammation Pathogenesis: Infiltration of the lamina propria and/or submucosa with neutrophils or mononuclear cell (Inflammation, neutrophil) or a combination (Inflammation, mixed) with additional histological features of inflammation e.g. hemorrhage, edema, fibroplasia. induced inflammatory reactions, for example trinitobenezensulfonic acid acts as hapten and induces a severe granulomatous reaction in the distal colon. there is the potential for secondary invasion of sites of mucosal injury and an exacerbation of any tissue injury and induction of an inflammatory response. inflammatory lesions can be induced by pathogenic bacteria e.g. salmonella, Citrobacter freundii, Helicobacter spp or viruses (norovirus, mouse hepatitis virus) morphology will depend on whether ameboid, ciliate or flagellates are present. rarely submucosal granulomata may be present in lamina propria. the degenerative changes and inclusions have only been seen with flaviviral infections. the most likely nematodes to be seen in the event of a barrier break down in a rodent unit are the pinworms. the reader is referred to standard texts for a full list of intestinal parasites that may be present in non-barrier maintained or wild rodents. diagnostic features Protozoa Presence of cross sections of protozoa in large intestinal lumen. morphology will depend on whether ameboid, ciliate or flagellates are present. neuronal degeneration, myenteric plexus with formation of hyaline inclusions in ganglion cells. diagnostic features Degenerative changes (hyaline, vacuolar) in neurons.

Cystic adenomatous hyperplasia; diverticulosis; herniated crypt; crypt herniation Diverticulum, atypical, may have been identified as: atypical cystic hyperplasia; cystic hyperplasia with growth into the gastric wall; cystic adenomatous hyperplasia; herniation, atypical; \u201cpseudoinvasion\u201d, atypical Modifiers: Cystic diverticula do not appear to be neoplastic, although they create an increased risk of rupture and septic peritonitis. small glandular diverticula lined by a single layer of cuboidal or columnar epithelium resemble \u201ccrypt herniation\u201d of human gastrointestinal pathology. atypical diverticula may be associated with atypical hyperplasia and adenoma, but usually not with adenocarcinoma. atypical diverticula must be distinguished from genuine neoplastic invasion. they are associated with preexisting mucosal atypical hyperplasia/dysplasia. regenerative hyperplasia may have been altered by the initiating event (degeneration and necrosis) Focal penetration by glandular diverticula into lamina propria or deeper layers may be present but basement membrane is always intact. hyperplasia is observed in the distal colon of mice infected with the gram negative bacterium Citrobacter freundii (transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia) the surface epithelium is covered by myriads of cocobacillary bacteria. hypertrophy is the recommended term for such lesions. the term GIN or dysplasia has been used in genetically-engineered mice. other terms occasionally used but not preferred as synonyms are microadenoma and intra-epithelial carcinoma. Brunner\u2019s glands cells are often hypertrophic with more extensive cytoplasm, larger nuclei, or both. underlying stroma may form pedunculated structures within the spaces of cystic glands. squamous metaplasia is often seen in chronic colitis models in mice. squamous cell carcinomas have not been reported to arise in the lesions.

Synonyms: Squamous metaplasia. Diagnostic features Focal, multifocal or diffuse Replacement of normal epithelium with squamous epithelium. squamous metaplasia is often seen in chronic colitis models in mice. g. Neoplasms Adenoma (Figures 138, 139, 140, 141 and 142) epithelium may contain foci of varying degrees of dysplasia. signs include cellular basophilia, loss of cellular polarity, hyperchromatic and pleomorphic nuclei, and nuclear stratification. an intra-epithelial small focus with cytological characteristics should NOT be diagnosed as an adenoma. the frequency of spontaneous intestinal adenomas varies with the intestinal segment. in the other intestinal segments the incidence of adenomas is below 5%. colon. Adenocarcinoma, mucinous, signet ring type. mucus-producing cells may be interspersed between absorptive cells. squamous metaplasia and focal mineralization are not present. an intestinal adenocarcinoma may arise de novo from normal epithelium, but more commonly from a preneoplastic lesion such as atypical hyperplasia or from an adenoma. the morphology and biology of tumor progression often depend on the etiology, i.e. the chemical carcinogen or the kind of genetic change in a GEM model. runner\u2019s glands carcinoma has been observed in transgenic mice (CB6/F1/Jic Tg rasH2 hemizygous) and Sprague-Dawley rats after dosing for 6 and 24 months. the rapid occurrence and high incidence of Brunner\u2019s glands carcinoma is more consistent with altered transcriptional regulation rather than a genotoxic mechanism. a malignant neoplasm of Brunner\u2019s glands can have similar morphologic features to those of a malignant neoplasm that has progressed extensively. stinct cell borders and fibrillary cytoplasm may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture. nuclei may be arranged in bundles with eosinophilic cytoplasm. cytokine receptor encoded by c-kit; cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture; spindle- or irregular-shaped nuclei. fibroma/sarcoma: CD 117 and S-100 negative; interlacing bundles of spindle cells; masson\u2019s trichrome-blue collagen. cells may be arranged in bundles with storiform architecture, myxoid areas may be present. spindle, epithelioid, or pleomorphic cell morphology. Indistinct cell borders and fibrillary cytoplasm. cecal GIST have been induced in GEM mice over-expressing a mutant KIT. the question arises whether conventionally classified stromal tumors previously were actually GIST. spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform nuclei with hyperchromasia, pleomorphism, and high mitotic index. nuclei sometime arranged in palisades (i.e., Antoni A pattern). phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin positive myofibrils. epithelium may contain foci of varying degrees of dysplasia. signs of cellular atypia include cellular basophilia, loss of cellular polarity and hyperchromatic nuclei. neoplasms may develop dysplastic foci and evolve into malignant neoplasms. chemicals causing benign intestinal tumors often also cause intestinal adenocarcinomas. adenomas exhibit some degree of dysplasia. the cytology of a non-invasive adenoma may include high grade dysplasia. in most rat and mouse chemically-induced or genetically-engineered tumor models, true invasion of the stalk is unusual. neoplasms may develop dysplastic foci and evolve into malignant neoplasms. chemicals causing benign intestinal tumors often also cause intestinal adenocarcinomas. macroscopic visibility has been suggested as a differential diagnostic criterion by some authors. adenoma may include high grade dysplasia. true invasion of the stalk is unusual in most rat and mouse models. an intestinal adenocarcinoma may arise de novo from normal epithelium, but more commonly from a preneoplastic lesion. spontaneous rodent adenocarcinomas show a predilection for the small intestine, especially the jejunum and ileum, rather than the large intestine. induced adenocarcinomas have their preferred localization in the distal colon and show high invasiveness combined with a low tendency to met inflammatory mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma are often scirrhous and mucinous. metastases are often associated with a specific method of tumor induction. mucinous intestinal adenocarcinomas are often the most malignant type of intestinal tumor in rats and mice. an intestinal adenocarcinoma may arise de novo from normal epithelium, but more commonly from a preneoplastic lesion. spontaneous rodent adenocarcinomas show a predilection for the small intestine rather than the large intestine. inflammatory mouse models of colon adenocarcinoma are often scirrhous and mucinous. Mucinous intestinal adenocarcinomas are often the most malignant type of intestinal tumor in rats and mice. carcinoma, Brunner\u2019s glands, is a rare tumor, although a high occurrence can be induced with certain test articles. a receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor targets multiple cellular kinase receptors. the rapid occurrence and high incidence of Brunner\u2019s glands carcinoma is more consistent with altered transcriptional regulation. a malignant neoplasm of Brunner\u2019s glands has progressed extensively. Brunner\u2019s glands carcinoma has been observed in transgenic mice (CB6/F1/Jic Tg rasH2 hemizygous) and Sprague-Dawley rats. the rapid occurrence and high incidence of Brunner\u2019s glands carcinoma is more consistent with altered transcriptional regulation rather than a genotoxic mechanism. differential diagnoses Leiomyosarcoma: Shows mitotic activity and cellular pleomorphism. differentiation from other soft tissue tumors possible only by immunohistochemistry. differential diagnoses Leiomyosarcoma: Shows mitotic activity and cellular pleomorphism. immunohistochemistry: Typically CD117 positive (cytokine receptor encoded by c-kit) differential diagnoses Leiomyoma: Shows little or no cellular pleomorphism or mitotic activity. differentiation from other soft tissue tumors possible only by immunohistochemistry.

Immunohistochemistry for smooth muscle actin. stromal tumors (e.g., leiomyoma) previously were actually GIST. the question arises whether conventionally classified stromal tumors (e.g., leiomyoma) previously were actually GIST. leiomyoscarcoma: CD117 negative, desmin positive; interlacing bundles and whorls of uniform spindle cells arranged in criss-cross pattern; blunt-ended, fusiform nuclei. minimal nuclear pleomorphism; phosphotungstic acid-hematoxylin positive myofibrils. the submandibular salivary gland matures with age and progress from rudimentary lobules of mesenchyme with ductular structures at birth to acinar development and complete maturation by about 30 days postnatally in rats. the major salivary glands are located on the ventral and lateral areas of the cervical region. the parotid glands drain into the parotid duct while the submandibular and sublingual glands drain into the oral cavity via Wharton\u2019s duct that terminates in small papillae near the incisors. the submandibular gland is a seromucinous (mixed) compound tubuloacinar gland. granular ducts are lined by tall columnar epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. the granulation of these ducts is much more prominent in sexually mature males when compared to females. the acinar cells are pyramidal with broad basophilic base and tapered apices. the eosinophilic granular cytoplasm contains zymogen granules. minor salivary glands lack a true connective tissue capsules. the minor salivary glands contribute about 14% protein and 1% amylase of the total salivary secretions. the salivary secretions are tightly regulated by the sympathetic (adrenergic) and parasympathetic (cholinergic) nervous system. most cell types within the submaxillary and parotid glands have both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations. elye et al. 1961) and terbutaline (Sodicoff et al. 1980) first cause rapid depletion of secretory granules. later promotes re-synthesis of secretory material leading to acinar atrophy. sexual dimorphism of submandibular gland salivary glands is dependent on testosterone levels. the oral cavity and pharynx are examined only occasionally during microscopic evaluation of these tissues. E. Nomenclature, Diagnostic Criteria, and Differential Diagnoses a. Congenital Lesions Ectopic tissue (Figures 158 and 159) vacuolation, cytoplasmic is the preferred terminology of the lesion that was previously diagnosed as hydropic degeneration. some metabolic insults cause disruption of normal lipid transport and metabolism and subsequently cause accumulation of lipid within the cytoplasm. oil red O and Sudan Black stains on frozen sections help to identify the neutral lipids within the micro/macro vesicles. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. phospholipidosis should only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved. apoptosis occurs predominantly in parotid and less commonly in submandibular and sublingual salivary glands. apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine light microscopic examination. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. some confirmatory techniques detect early phases of apoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections. necrosis, accompanied by neutrophilic inflammation with edema, may be induced by direct contact with a test article after oral uptake/administration. single cell pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue. apoptosis/necrosis Synonym: Cell death Pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammatory reaction (single cell necrosis) there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. secretory depletion, acinar cell Pathogenesis: Decrease of acinar cell zymogen granules or mucin leading to shrunken acinar cells. diagnostic features Focal, lobular or diffuse. Reduced acinar diameter. lack of fibrosis or adipocyte infiltration. diagnostic features may be focal or multifocal, but usually diffuse. Affects males, not females. Partial or complete loss of serous granules leading to a reduced cell size. Lack of fibrosis or adipocyte infiltration. may beaccompanied by degranulation of the acinar cells. the submandibular salivary gland is sexually dimorphic and shows increased granularity of the convoluted (granular) ducts in males compared to females. the submandibular salivary gland is sexually dimorphic. atrophy more commonly affects the submandibular and parotid glands than the sublingual gland. the sublingual glands lack sympathetic innervation and thus are spared in situations where the chemicals act on the sympathetic nervous system. mineralization Synonym: Calcification Pathogenesis: Deposition of mineral either secondary to cellular necrosis (dystrophic mineralization) or secondary to hypercalcemia (metastatic mineralization). Differential diagnoses Artifacts: Hematoxylin stain deposits (distribution unrelated to tissue structures), acid hematin (birefringent in polarized light). Pigment: Lipofusin and porphyrin stain brown to golden brown on H& pigment can be identified by special stains like Schmorl\u2019s (late lipofuscin, melanin), Fontana-Masson (melanin), and Perl\u2019s (ferric iron-hemosiderin). polarization can help differentiate some pigments like lipofuscin (strong orange autofluorescence on unstained FFPE sections) and acid-hematin (birefringent in polarized light) amyloid and amyloid-like material has been observed in various tissues, including salivary glands of aged rodents, especially mice. the characteristic morphologic appearance and location of amyloid in H&E sections that is usually adequate to make this diagnosis. inflammatory cell infiltrates are encountered more commonly than inflammation (sialadenitis) the term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should not be confused with or used in lieu of inflammatory cell infiltrate. inflammatory cell infiltrates should be qualified with the type of inflammatory cells that are predominant. the term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with obvious tissue injury/reaction associated with inflammation. edema, congestion, acinar (parotid) cell degranulation, hemorrhage or necrosis is part of the inflammation and covered by this term. inflammation, mononuclear cell Infiltrate predominantly neutrophilic; frequently accompanied by edema and congestion, parotid acinar cell degranulation, acinar and ductular degeneration and necrosis. other morphologic features associated with inflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or fibroplasias will be absent. MCMV and sialodacryoadenitis virus were once common causes of acute sialodacryoadenitis in mice and rats. MCMV predominantly affects the submandibular glands and in rare cases the parotid glands. the diagnosis of edema should be reserved for a transudative type of edema since exudative edema is usually accompanied by abundant inflammatory cell infiltrate and possibly tissue injury. the primary diagnosis in cases of exudative edema should be inflammation, neutrophil. diagnostic features Presence of erythrocytes in parenchymal or interstitial tissue. Differential diagnoses Angiectasis: Blood present within dilated ductules and ducts. diagnostic features Solitary or multiple tortuous irregularly enlarged lumina that may or may not contain gland-specific secretory material. may be accompanied by mild interstitial infiltration of lymphocytes and plasma cells. acinar cell Synonym: Cytomegaly Pathogenesis: Usually secondary to increased functional demand or due to sympathomimetic stimulation. hyperplasia, regenerative: may be associated with hypertrophy, but always increase in cell number and cytoplasmic basophilia. single or repeated mandibular incisor tooth amputation also resulted in enlargement of submandibular glands. enlargement was due to abundant intracytoplasmic accumulation of mucus along with calcium, amylase and other protein. basophilic hypertrophic foci are more common in rats than in mice. doxylamine, triprolidine, methyleugenol and diethanolamine induce basophilic hypertrophic foci in rodents. metaplasia is usually seen as a part of the regenerative response following necrosis of the ductal epithelium. a common cause of this lesion in rats is due to sialodacryoadenitis viral infection. vitamin A deficient diet induced squamous metaplasia in the ducts of parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands in Sprague-Dawley rats. squamous cell metaplasia was described in mice after treatment with DMBA and was proven to be of ductal segment origin by the presence of keratin proteins. ductal segments undergoing squamous cell metaplasia may have participated in the genesis of neoplasia during experimental carcinogenesis (Cao et al. 2000, Sumitomo et al. 1996). no tumor progression was noted after 2 years treatment. multifocal ductal cell hyperplasia was induced in intercalated duct cells of the submandibular salivary glands of Wistar rats. cytoplasm may be amphophilic, increased nucleus to cytoplasm ratio. transgenic mice showed hyperplasia of the salivary gland. ibular glands in serous acinar cells expressing a retinoid acid receptor. ductular cells expressing simian virus 40 T antigen are rare. salivary gland adenomas may arise from either acinar or ductular components.

Modifiers: Acinar, tubular, papillary, solid, mixed acinar/tubular Histogenesis: Ductal or acinar epithelium of salivary glands. acinar adenomas of the salivary glands may be difficult to distinguish from well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. acinar adenomas may be difficult to distinguish from well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. salivary glands were composed of epithelial and myoepithelial structures. the epithelial component showed various growth patterns. the spindle-shaped myoepithelial cells were embedded in a myxoid stroma. multinodular acinar adenomas may be difficult to distinguish from well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. poorly differentiated carcinomas of the parotid gland of young Sprague-Dawley rats. adenocarcinomas in the submandibular gland were reported after intraglandular injection of DMBA in female Wistar rats. a naturally occurring mucoepidermoid carcinoma in the salivary gland associated with both myoepithelium and duct epithelium was described in two mice. new tab Mouse parotid gland. Carcinoma, squamous cell. Higher magnification of Figure 197. Figure 199. Mouse parotid gland. Carcinoma, squamous cell. Higher magnification of Figure 197. squamous cell carcinomas in rodents are rare, but have been induced with chemicals in rats. they occur spontaneously in mice with the v-Ha-ras oncogene. also adenosquamous carcinomas of the mammary gland need to be considered as a differential diagnosis. mouse polyoma virus causes salivary gland tumors including a mixed epithelial-mesenchymal type. fibroadenomas are separately classified, although they are benign mixed tumors. mixed malignant tumor with epithelioid and spindeloid growth pattern may be difficult. mixed epithelial and mesenchymal antigenic expression would be demonstrated in case of the malignant myoepithelioma. myoepitheliomas of the salivary glands have not been described in rats. most frequent locations are the parotid and submandibular glands. PTAH staining will aid in confirmation of intracytoplasmic fibrils within myoepithelial cells. frequent poor encapsulation, pleomorphic morphology, and central necrosis are compatible with a malignant interpretation. however, Sundberg et al. suggested few are malignant based on stringent criteria of metastasis to the lung or infiltration of underlying bone. the morphology of tumors with confirmed metastases is not unique, as compared to those without. the submandibular (mandibular or submaxillary) salivary gland is a tan, multilobular gland located in the ventral cervical region. it extends rostrally to the mandibular lymph nodes, caudally to the thoracic inlet. the sublingual glands consist of tan-brown bilateral single lobes located on the rostro-lateral surface of each of the submandibular large pyramidal mucous cells have abundant vesicular basophilic cytoplasm and basally located nuclei. cresentric serous demilunes have scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. acinar secretions from the adenomeres empty into intercalated ducts lined by low cuboidal epithelial cells. several interlobular excretory ducts continue into one main excretory duct that expands into a diverticulum lined by columnar epithelium. the sublingual gland is predominantly mucous secreting and has the largest acini. the acinar secretions empty into intercalated ducts that in turn empty into striated (intralobular) ducts. the minor salivary glands lack a true connective tissue capsules. they are usually located within the submucosa or are interspaced between connective tissue stroma or muscle fibers. the salivary glands secrete a hypotonic sero-mucinous saliva containing electrolytes and enzymes that aid in lubrication. parasympathetic system and -adrenergic sympathetic system regulate the water and inorganic ion phase of the primary secretory fluid. -adrenergic sympathetic system effects primarily the macromolecular (enzymes) phase. sympathetic stimulation does not inhibit salivary secretion but it modulates saliva composition. the microscopic minor lingual glands are routinely examined if the entire tongue, including its base, is removed. the other minor salivary glands located within the oral cavity and pharynx are examined only occasionally during microscopic evaluation of these tissues. cellular degeneration, injury and death vacuolation, fatty degeneration, lipidosis, lipid accumulation, and lipid accumulation. cells may be swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and have intracytoplasmic vacuoles. vacuolation, cytoplasmic is preferred terminology of the lesion that was previously diagnosed as hydropic degeneration. any chemical/factor affecting the integrity of the cell membranes can potentially cause poorly defined intracytoplasmic vacuoles that was previously diagnosed as hydropic degeneration. multilamellated structures (myeloid bodies/lamellar bodies) are observed in lysosomes. the term phospholipidosis should only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved. morphological features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria. apoptosis/necrosis: both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or immunohistochemistry for caspases. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained sections. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis. inflammation, acute: Infiltrates of inflammatory cells, edema, and fibrin predominate; necrosis may be present, but is a minor component. features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria. there is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria. morphology of the acini may be altered due to several physiological conditions, such as anorexia/inanition. degranulation may also be noted in rodents treated with sympathomimetic agents like isoprenaline. the atrophy of the granular ducts may be due to the hypogonadal effect of diabetes. in cases of sympathetic but not parasympathetic nerve stimulation, extensive degranulation may be observed. atrophy more commonly affects the submandibular and parotid glands than the sublingual gland. it may be an age related lesion or may be induced experimentally. any experimental condition that acts on their homeostasis may potentially induce diffuse salivary gland atrophy. hypophysectomy (Koerker 1967), adrenalectomy, denervation and - and -adrenergic antagonists. also decreased food consumption, and protein starvation lead to salivary gland atrophy. pigment can be identified by special stains like Schmorl\u2019s (late lipofuscin, melanin), Fontana-Masson (mel.) pigments can be identified by special stains like alizarin red S and von Kossa. pigments can also be identified by special stains like Schmorl\u2019s. formalin-heme pigment (acid-hematin) is observed in tissues fixed in unbuffered formalin. polarization can help differentiate some pigments like lipofuscin (strong orange autofluorescence on unstained FFPE sections) inflammatory Lesions Infiltrate is the appropriate term for homogenously eosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. inflammatory cell infiltrates are encountered more commonly than inflammation (sialadenitis) in toxicity studies, inflammatory cell infiltrates are encountered more commonly than inflammation (sialadenitis) the term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should not be confused with or used in lieu of inflammatory cell infiltrate. mouse parotid gland. Inflammation, mononuclear cell. intranuclear inclusion bodies, some of them indicated by arrows. inflammation, mixed; acompanied by regenerative hyperplasia. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. inflammation, neutrophilic of salivary glands is uncommon in toxicological evaluation of tissues. tid or mucous/serous (submandibular) glands spared in SDAV infections in rats. bacteria due to Klebsiella aerogenes and Staphylococcus aureus may also cause severe necrotizing sialadenitis. edema in the salivary glands is very uncommon. it may be exudative (inflammatory edema due to capillary injury secondary to leakage of enzymes) or transudative (hydrodynamic derangement secondary to increased hydrostatic osmotic pressure and decreased oncotic pressure) ductular epithelium may be low to flattened cuboidal epithelium. may be accompanied by mild periductular mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate. Differential diagnoses Ectasia, duct: Salivary calculi are absent. ectasia is used only in the absence of the calculi or the foreign body within the histologic section. ectasia is used only in the absence of the calculi or the foreign body within the histologic section. hyperplasia, regenerative: may be associated with hypertrophy, but always increase in cell number. minimal compression or distortion of architecture may be present. hypertrophy of the parotid and submandibular glands has been observed. enlarged cells can be diffusely basophilic in extreme cases where most of the parotid is affected. enlarged cells can be diffusely basophilic in extreme cases. triprolidine (Greenman et al. 1995), glyphosate (NTP, 1992a), methyleugenol (NTP, 2000) and diethanolamine (NTP, 1992b) induce basophilic hypertrophic foci in rodents. these foci are considered adaptive hypertrophic lesions rather than precursors of neoplasia. squamous epithelial cells may be uni- or multilayered. keratinization may be present. may be accompanied by duct hyperplasia. squamous cell metaplasia of the ductular epithelium has been considered as a preneoplastic condition progressing to neoplasia. the potential for progression of hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the ductular epithelium is unclear. squamous cell metaplasia of the salivary gland was not associated with neoplastic findings in the salivary gland after two years. non-neoplastic Proliferative Lesions Hyperplasia ductal. Modifiers: Acinar, ductal, reactive, atypical Histogenesis: Ductal and/or acinar epithelium of the salivary glands. hyperplastic and metaplastic changes associated with spontaneously occurring neoplasms have not been identified in F344 rats. hyperplasia of the salivary ducts is a common feature of many inflammatory and reactive conditions in the salivary glands of rodents. malignant tumors in salivary glands may be induced with chemical substances in rats (Neuenschwander and Elwell 1990;Sumitomo et al.1996; Cao et al. 1999; Zaman et al. 1996) and mice (Botts et al. 1999; Takegawa et al. 1998; Takai et al. 1986; Takai et al. 1986; Takai et al. 1995); growth pattern may be acinar, tubular, papillary, solid, or mixed. minor areas with solid growth pattern may be present. excretory ducts are usually absent. only acinar adenomas of the salivary glands have been described. rats may develop different growth patterns listed as Modifiers. few adenomas have been observed in mice. acinar, tubular, papillary, solid, mixed acinar/tubular/solid Histogenesis: Ductal or acinar epithelium of salivary glands. Diagnostic features Grows in whorls or spindle pattern. Necrosis frequently present. Areas of squamous differentiation may be present. multinodular acinar adenomas may be difficult to distinguish from well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. poorly differentiated carcinomas of the parotid gland of young Sprague-Dawley rats were reported. the oncogene SV40 T antigen is expressed from the neonatal submandibular gland secretory protein b (Smgb) gene promoter. development of pleomorphic adenoma with malignant characteristics was described in the submandibular gland of transgenic mice with PLAG1 proto-oncogene over expression. differential diagnoses Adenocarcinoma: Consisting of acinar, tubular, mixed, solid or papillary components; squamous differentiation may occur, but is not predominant. squamous cell carcinomas should be ascribed to the Zymbal\u2019s gland if origin from other sites (mammary, salivary glands) is not evident. mous carcinomas of the mammary gland should be distinguished from invasive Zymbal\u2019s gland carcinomas with squamous differentiation by their location in situ. features of both a benign mesenchymal tumor and an adenoma are present. differential diagnoses Tumor, mixed, benign: Features of both a benign mesenchymal tumor and an adenoma; no cellular pleomorphism, no local invasion. differentiation between the mixed malignant tumor and the malignant myoepithelioma may be difficult based on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. myoepithelial cells, extraglandular ductal origin, salivary glands (possibly other glandular tissues) diagnostic features Unencapsulated tumor; may show invasive cords of solid tissue extending into adjacent structures. in larger tumors, central degeneration and necrosis may form pseudo-cysts. plastic myoepithelial cells have been reported to stain positive for cytokeratin and for keratins K5 and K14 and vimentin. PTAH staining will aid in confirmation of intracytoplasmic fibrils within the myoepithelial cells. they are negative for smooth muscle cell alpha-actin immunohistochemistry. a. Congenital Lesions Ectopic tissue (Figures 158 and 159) Figure 158. Rat sublingual gland. Ectopic tissue, parotid gland; higher magnification of Figure 158. Pathogenesis: remnant of embryonic cell rests. Modifiers: Parotid gland, submandibular gland, sublingual gland Diagnostic features Focal. Circumscribed normal parotid, submandibular or sublingual gland acini within a cells may be swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and have intracytoplasmic vacuoles with variably margins. vacuolation, cytoplasmic is the preferred terminology of the. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. the term phospholipidosis should only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved. the term phospholipidosis should only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved. morphological features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) apoptosis/necrosis: both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or immunohistochemistry for caspases, in particular caspase 3. some of these techniques detect early phases of apoptosis. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis (cell and nucleus shrunken, hypereosinophilic cytoplasm, nuclear pyknosis etc.) morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria. there is a requirement for recording apoptosis and necrosis separately. the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. degranulation of acini may be accompanied by fibrosis, mononuclear cell infiltrates, prominent intra- and inter-lobular ducts. morphology of the acini may be altered due to several physiological conditions, such as anorexia/inanition. atrophy of the granular ducts in chronic diabetic rats may be due to the hypogonadal effect of diabetes. granules increased, granular duct (submandibular gland) atrophy more commonly affects the submandibular and parotid glands than the sublingual gland. it may be an age related lesion or may be induced experimentally. any experimental condition that acts on their homeostasis may potentially induce diffuse salivary gland atrophy. hypophysectomy (Koerker 1967), adrenalectomy, denervation and - and -adrenergic antagonists. decreased food consumption, and protein starvation lead to salivary gland atrophy. Dystrophic calcification occurs in necrotic/injured tissue even in animals with reference range serum calcium levels. metastatic calcification occurs throughout the body, especially in hypercalcemic animals. special stains like alizarin red S and von Kossa can help identify calcium salts within tissue sections. hematin is observed in tissues fixed in unbuffered formalin. polarization can help differentiate some pigments like lipofuscin. birefringence on H&E sections. cells may be swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and have intracytoplasmic vacuoles with variably margins. the size of vacuoles may vary from small (microvesicular) to large. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. cells may be swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm and have intracytoplasmic vacuoles with variably margins. vacuolation, cytoplasmic is the preferred terminology of the lesion that was previously diagnosed as hydropic degeneration. the parotid is the major salivary gland most susceptible to cytoplasmic vacuolation. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. disruption of lobular structure. Differential diagnosis Vacuolation due to storage of lipids: Moderate to abundant intracytoplasmic lipid vacuoles; acinar and ductular architecture is retained. Atrophy: Reduction in the number/size of acini is the predominant finding. nucelar pyknosis, karyorrhexis, nucelar pyknosis, nucelar pyknosis and karyorrhexis overlap. necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination. apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or immunohistochemistry for caspases. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained sections. the approach for the nomenclature and diagnostic criteria of cell death applied here is based on a draft recommendation of the INHAND Cell Death Nomenclature Working Group. the main morphological differences between these two types of cell death are cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages in apoptosis versus cell swelling, rupture and inflammation in necrosis. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained slides only. some studies may require the consideration of forms of programmed cell death other than apoptosis. apoptosis/necrosis: both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. the term is also used when the type of cell death cannot be determined unequivocally. inflammation, acute: infiltrates of inflammatory cells, edema, and fibrin predominate; necrosis may be present. Necrosis of salivary glands may be due to chemical toxicity or emboli. the combined term apoptosis/necrosis may be used. it is recommended to explain in detail the use of this combined term in the narrative part of the pathology report. acinar cell Pathogenesis: Decrease of acinar cell zymogen granules or mucin leading to shrunken acinar cells. diagnostic features may be focal or multifocal, but usually diffuse. morphology of the granular ducts is androgen dependent. secretory depletion and subsequent atrophy of granular ducts may be observed in male rats and mice with decreased androgen levels. morphology of the acini may be altered due to several physiological conditions, such as anorexia/inanition. morphology of the acini may be altered due to several physiological conditions, such as anorexia/inanition. morphology of the granular ducts is androgen dependent. secretory depletion and subsequent atrophy may be observed in male rats and mice with decreased androgen levels. the submandibular salivary gland is sexually dimorphic and shows increased granularity of the convoluted (granular) ducts in males compared to females. the submandibular salivary gland is sexually dimorphic. atrophy more commonly affects the submandibular and parotid glands than the sublingual gland. it may be an age related lesion or may be induced experimentally, usually as a secondary response after obstruction of excretory ducts. degranulation (parotid), reduced mucin (submandibular and sublingual) apoptotic bodies may be present. variable degree of interstitial fibrosis with/without lymphocytes and plasma cells. ductular foreign bodies may be present. atrophy of salivary glands due to liquid diet affects parotid and submandibular glands. also decreased food consumption, and protein starvation lead to salivary gland atrophy. sublingual glands lack sympathetic innervation. special stains like Alizarin red S and von Kossa can help identify calcium salts within tissue sections. differential diagnoses Artifacts: Hematoxylin stain deposits (distribution unrelated to tissue structures), acid hematin (birefringent in polarized light) Pigment: Lipofusin and porphyrin stain brown to golden brown on H&E. the distribution of the pigment will differ dependent on its nature. lipofuscin may be found mainly within epithelial cells of the intralobular ducts. hemosiderin may be found within the interstitium and macrophages. acid hematin may be present diffusely within the section. the type of pigment can be identified by special stains like Schmorl\u2019s (late lipofuscin, melanin), Fontana-Masson (melanin), and Perl\u2019s (ferric iron-hemosiderin). Polarization can help differentiate some pigments like lipofuscin (strong orange autofluorescence on unstained FFPE sections) the term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of extracellular deposits hyaline material in H&E sections. Hyaline is also the appropriate term for homogenously eosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red. infiltrate mononuclear cell, infiltrate mononuclear cell, infiltration, inflammatory cell Modifiers: type of inflammatory cell that represents the predominant cell type in the infiltrate Pathogenesis: Infiltration with neutrophils (Infiltrate, neutrophil), eosinophils (Infiltrate, eosinophil), mononuclear cells (Infiltrate, mixed) present without other morphological features of inflammation. the term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should not be confused with or used in lieu of inflammatory cell infiltrate. inflammatory cell infiltrates should be qualified with type of inflammatory cells that are predominant, such as mononuclear, lymphocyte, neutrophil. inflammation, mixed; acompanied by regenerative hyperplasia with atypia. intranuclear inclusion bodies, some of them indicated by arrows (rat papilloma virus) infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. inflammation, neutrophilic of the salivary glands is uncommon in toxicological evaluation of tissues. siella aerogenes and Staphylococcus aureus may cause severe acute necrotizing sialadenitis as well as abscesses. the infiltrating lymphocytic population is predominantly CD4+ T cells and less than 10% cells are C8+ T cells. inflammatory cell infiltrates are encountered more commonly than inflammation (sialadenitis) the term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should not be confused with or used in lieu of inflammatory cell infiltrate. inflammatory cell infiltrates should be qualified with the type of inflammatory cells that are predominant. the term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with obvious tissue injury/reaction associated with inflammation such as edema, congestion, acinar (parotid) cell degranulation, hemorrhage or necrosis. Mild atrophy of surrounding cells may be present. the term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with obvious tissue injury/reaction associated with inflammation. the term inflammation (or sialadenitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with obvious tissue injury/reaction associated with inflammation. inflammation, mononuclear cell Infiltrate predominantly neutrophilic; frequently accompanied by edema and congestion, parotid acinar cell degranulation, acinar and ductular degeneration and necrosis. other morphologic features associated with inflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, edema, fibroplasia may be absent. inflammation, neutrophilic of the salivary glands is uncommon in toxicological evaluation of tissues. infection with murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) and sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) were once common causes of acute sialodacryoadenitis. chronic infections of MCMV and SDAV or regenerative lesions from acute MCMV and SDAV may appear morphologically similar to chronic inflammatory lesions. rats treated with sympathomimetics like isoproterenol present with mild chronic inflammation in the submandibular salivary gland. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. inflammation, neutrophilic of the salivary glands is uncommon in toxicological evaluation of tissues. the infiltrating lymphocytic population is predominantly CD4+ T cells. regenerative lesions from acute MCMV and SDAV may appear morphologically similar to chronic inflammatory lesions. the diagnosis of edema should be reserved for a transudative type of edema since exudative edema is usually accompanied by abundant inflammatory cell infiltrate and possibly tissue injury. the primary diagnosis in cases of edema should be inflammation, neutrophil. the diagnosis of edema should be reserved for a transudative type of edema since exudative edema is usually accompanied by abundant inflammatory cell infiltrate and possibly tissue injury. the primary diagnosis in cases of exudative edema should be inflammation, neutrophil. Hemorrhage Pathogenesis: Increased vascular permeability (diapedesis) or rupture of blood vessels. Differential diagnoses Angiectasis: Blood present within dilated vascular lumina. a diagnosis of ductular ectasia should not be used in the presence of the ductular calculi, even though they share other morphologic features. a diagnosis of ectasia is used only in the absence of the calculi. inflammation, mixed cell, chronic: Fibrosis associated with inflammatory cell infiltrates and degenerative parenchymal changes. hypertrophy, acinar cell Synonym: Cytomegaly Pathogenesis: Usually secondary to increased functional demand or due to sympathomimetic stimulation. isoproterenol (Selye et al. 1961, Brenner and Stanton, 1970), methoxamine and pilocarpine (Inanaga et al. 1988), terbutaline, epinephrine, phenylephrine, reserpine, furosemide (Scarlett et al. 1988), alloxan (Sagstrom et al. 1987), th basal regions of the acinar cells have intensely basophilic cytoplasm with large hyperchromatic nuclei. the enlarged cells can be diffusely basophilic in extreme cases where most of the parotid is affected. differentiated salivary gland epithelium into a different type of fully differentiated salivary gland epithelium. ectopic tissue: Usually focal, circumscribed and not associated with prior tissue injury. ductal squamous cell metaplasia is usually seen as a part of the regenerative response following necrosis of the ductal epithelium. the sublingual glands are spared from pathologic changes in SDAV infections. squamous cell metaplasia of the salivary gland was not associated with neoplastic findings in the salivary gland after two years. squamous cell metaplasia was induced with chlorodibromomethane in F344 rats but not in B6C3F1 mice after 13-week treatment. no tumor progression was noted after 2 years treatment. ductular epithelium may be low to flattened cuboidal epithelium. may be accompanied by mild periductular mononuclear inflammatory cell infiltrate. Differential diagnoses Ectasia, duct: Salivary calculi are absent. ectasia results from blockage of inter- and intra-lobular ducts either proximally or distally due to rare inspissated secretory material (sialolithiasis), sialodacryoadenitis tumors, or foreign bodies. a diagnosis of ectasia is used only in the absence of the calculi or the foreign body within the histologic section. inflammation, mixed cell, chronic: Fibrosis associated with inflammatory cell infiltrates and degenerative parenchymal changes. it is usually a significant component of chronic inflammation and may be a component of healing after acute toxic insults. hyperplasia, non-regenerative: may be associated with hypertrophy, but always increase in cell number. minimal compression or distortion of architecture may be present. hypertrophy (and hyperplasia) of the parotid and submandibular glands has been observed. enlarged cells can be diffusely basophilic in extreme cases where most of the parotid is affected. enlarged cells can be diffusely basophilic in extreme cases. doxylamine (Jackson and Blackwell 1993), triprolidine (Greenman et al. 1995), glyphosate (NTP, 1992a), methyleugenol (NTP, 2000) and diethanolamine (NTP, 1992b) induce basophilic hypertrophic foci in rodents. these foci are considered adaptive hypertrophic lesions rather than precursors of neoplasia. single or repeated mandibular incisor tooth amputation also resulted in enlargement of submandibular glands. enlargement was due to abundant intracytoplasmic accumulation of mucus along with calcium, amylase and other protein. in diffusely affected cases, the acinar enlargement is not as prominent as seen in smaller focal basophilic foci. hypertrophy, acinar cell: Cells in single or multiple acini (foci) enlarged without increased cytoplasmic basophilia.

Squamous cell carcinomas should be distinguished from invasive Zymbal\u2019s gland carcinomas with squamous differentiation by their location in situ. features of both a benign mesenchymal tumor and an adenoma are present. differentiation between the mixed malignant tumor and the malignant myoepithelioma may be difficult based on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. mixed epithelial and mesenchymal antigenic expression would be demonstrated in case of the myoepithelioma. tumor morphology with confluent regions of basal, stratified squamous, and spindle cell patterns may contain tubular structures. tumor cells may show palisading basal cell pattern or align in epithelioid fashion. squamous appearance without keratinization may occur in some areas. PTAH staining will aid in confirmation of intracytoplasmic fibrils within the myoepithelial cells. neoplasms arise from a subset of extraglandular ductal myoepithelial cells that are negative for smooth muscle cell alpha-actin immunohistochemistry. such confirmatory stains may be required for differentiation of myoepitheliomas from mixed malignant tumors. 189.

Metastasis to the lung may be present. dular acinar adenomas may be difficult to distinguish from well-differentiated adenocarcinomas. poorly differentiated carcinomas of the parotid gland of young Sprague-Dawley rats were reported. induction of adenocarcinomas in the submandibular gland was reported. expressing a human Ha-ras oncogene developed adenocarcinomas arising from the submandibular gland. in wap-ras transgenic mice adenocarcinomas arising from the submandibular gland were reported to develop spontaneously by one year of age. tumor cells with epithelioid differentiation or palisading around blood vessels. areas of densely packed elongated to spindeloid tumor cells separated by a delicate and inactive tumor stroma. squamous cell carcinomas in rodents are rare, but have been induced with chemicals in rats. differential diagnoses Adenocarcinoma: Consisting of acinar, tubular, mixed, solid or papillary components; squamous differentiation may occur, but is not predominant. squamous cell carcinomas should be ascribed to the Zymbal\u2019s gland, if origin from other sites (mammary, salivary glands) is not evident. carcinomas of the mammary gland should be distinguished from invasive Zymbal\u2019s gland carcinomas with squamous differentiation by their location in situ. squamous cell carcinomas of the salivary glands should be distinguished from invasive Zymbal\u2019s gland carcinomas with squamous differentiation by their location in situ. differential diagnoses Tumor, mixed, malignant: Features of both a sarcoma and a carcinoma present; cellular pleomorphism present. cellular pleomorphism is not present. no evidence of invasion. mouse polyoma virus causes salivary gland tumors including a mixed epithelial-mesenchymal type. differentiation between the mixed malignant tumor and the malignant myoepithelioma may be difficult based on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. mixed malignant tumor and malignant myoepithelioma with epithelioid and spindeloid growth pattern may be difficult based on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. mixed epithelial and mesenchymal antigenic expression would be demonstrated in case of the malignant myoepithelioma. myoepitheliomas of the salivary glands have not been described in rats. most frequent locations are the parotid and submandibular glands. PTAH staining will aid in confirmation of intracytoplasmic fibrils within myoepithelial cells. most of these tumors have been ascribed to the salivary glands. the frequent poor encapsulation, pleomorphic morphology, and central necrosis are compatible with a malignant interpretation. however, sundberg et al. suggested few are malignant. myoepitheliomas of the salivary glands have not been described in rats. most frequent locations are the parotid and submandibular glands. most frequent locations are the parotid and submandibular glands. the frequent poor encapsulation, pleomorphic morphology, and central necrosis are compatible with a malignant interpretation. however, Sundberg et al. suggested few are malignant based on stringent criteria of metastasis to the lung or infiltration of underlying bone. the morphology of tumors with confirmed metastases is not unique, as compared to those without. the exocrine pancreas consists of a single layer of pyramidal acinar cells arranged concentrically around a lumen. the apex of the pyramidal cells facing the lumen contains eosinophilic zymogen granules. the base of the pyramidal cells is basophilic due to abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and also contains the nucleus. exocrine acini, centro-acinar cells, ductal cells and the endocrine cells within the islets have a unique ability to de-differentiate and transdifferentiate into other pancreatic histologic cell types. after certain types of tissue injury, the exocrine acini undergo de-differentiation and may attain a ductular morphology. the exocrine pancreas has great reserve capacity and no clinical evidence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is noted. a large part of the left lobe of the pancreas is removed for trimming. diagnostic features Usually focal distribution. Fully differentiated non-pancreatic tissue in the pancreas. Usually circumscribed and not wholly integrated into the \u2018host\u2019 tissue. acinar cell vacuolation is a reversible change and is usually a reflection of hypoxia and metabolic insults resulting in damage to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, protein machinery, and plasma membrane. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. the term phospholipidosis should only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved. the term phospholipidosis should only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved. hyalinosis is a member of the chitinase family that may be produced in response to mucosal irritation. the same term may also be used for a distinctly different clinical disorder in humans. autophagy is a homeostatic mechanism that plays a major role in the catabolism by lysosomal digestion of organelles and/or aged cytoplasmic contents. it occurs at basal levels in all tissues to maintain cellular homeostasis. autophagy may be detected by electron microscopy, by fluorescent localization pattern of LC3 puncta or by immunohistochemistry using antibodies against LC3-II. autophagosomes within the cytoplasm, under light microscopy, appear as discrete vacuoles with some dark eosinophilic or amphophilic contents. morphological features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) apoptosis/necrosis: both types of cell death are present. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) or immunohistochemistry for caspases. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained sections. acinar cell apoptosis may be increased in fasted or chronically anorectic animals. the degree of apoptosis is in these cases lower than that of acute pancreatic injury. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with apoptosis. apoptosis/necrosis: both types of cell death are present and there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred. apoptosis/necrosis Synonym: Cell death Pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue and subsequent inflammatory reaction (single cell necrosis) there is no requirement to record them separately or a combined term is preferred for statistical reasons. acinar cells are shrunken with increased basophilia due to decreased zymogen granules. acinar cells are shrunken with increased basophilia due to increased basophilia. atrophy, acinar cell, associated with infltrate mononuclear cell. pathogenesis: Decrease in number and/or size of acinar cells may be due to spontaneous or experimentally induced degenerative changes. exocrine acinar atrophy is the most common spontaneous degenerative change in pancreas of both rats and mice. acinar atrophy may range from focal atrophic exocrine acini with no inflammation or fibrosis to diffuse atrophy of exocrine acini with replacement by adipose tissue. chronic protein or essential amino acid deficiency, copper deficiency, zinc deficiency, ethionine, hypophysectomy or high doses of glucagon induce loss of zymogen granules and pancreatic atrophy. malonaldehyde caused atrophy of exocrine pancreas in both male and female mice. the two commonly used stains for detecting calcium are alizarin red and von Kossa. the two commonly used stains for detecting calcium are alizarin red and von Kossa. pigment deposition, pigmentation, endogenous pigmentation, exogenous pigment deposition Pathogenesis: Diverse, dependent on nature of pigment. special stains like alizarin red S and von Kossa can help identify calcium salts. infiltration with neutrophils (infiltrate, neutrophil), eosinophils (infiltrate, mononuclear cell), mononuclear cells (infiltrate, mononuclear cell) or a combination of more than one type (infiltrate, mixed) without other histological features of inflammation, e.g. hemorrhage, edema, fibroplasia. the term inflammation (pancreatitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with tissue injury/reaction. the term inflammation (pancreatitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with tissue injury/reaction. of inflammation is spontaneous arteritis involving the pancreatoduodenal artery. pathogenesis usually involves release of inactive proenzymes from exocrine pancreas and activation of these digestive enzymes locally and systemically. inflammation, neutrophil Infiltrate predominantly neutrophilic; frequently accompanied by edema and congestion. infiltration of monomorphic population of lymphocytes is likely present in other organs. no inflammatory cell infiltration, congestion or edema. acinar cell atrophy is the predominant component of the diagnosis. chronic inflammation occurs more commonly in diabetic rats than non-diabetic counterparts. chronic exposure to manganese causes chronic pancreatitis, fibrosis and acinar atrophy. inflammation of the vasculature, if present, is frequently noted in histological sections of pancreas due to the prominent pancreato-duodenal artery and other small caliber interlobular pancreatic arteries. if present, arteritis lesions may be due to immune-mediated etiology as seen in spontaneously hypertensive rat strains. hage may be exudative (inflammatory edema due to capillary injury secondary to leakage of pancreatic enzymes) or transudative (hydrodynamic derangement secondary to increased hydrostatic osmotic pressure and decreased oncotic pressure) differential diagnoses Angiectasis: Blood present within dilated vascular lumina. artifact: Erythrocytes on the surface of the pancreas sample or infiltrating from the surface into interstitial tissue. acinar cells with more abundant cytoplasmic volume with larger zymogen granules than tele-insular acinar cells. acinar cells with more abundant cytoplasmic volume with larger zymogen granules than tele-insular acinar cells. the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata. peri-insular acinar cells are more resistant (3 hours) to pilocarpine-induced degranulation than the tele-insular acinar cells (1 hour) the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. basophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats. basophilic foci have similar proliferative ability as surrounding normal exocrine acini. basophilic foci should not be considered preneoplastic. basophilic foci stained positively with gamma-glutamyltranspetidase. eosinophilic foci stained negatively with gamma-glutamyltranspetidase. incidence of metaplastic hepatic foci is less than 1% in control rats. metaplastic hepatic foci in the pancreas were also induced in a transgenic mouse model where KGF (FGF7) was over-expressed in the pancreas under the control of the rat insulin promoter. an increase in metaplastic hepatic foci in toxicological studies may also be due to the result of test article-induced pancreatic atrophy and subsequent hepatic transdifferentiation. the diagnosis of ductular metaplasia is not commonly used in toxicologic studies since it is one of the features of atrophy. the lesions of duct ectasia or interlobular cystic ducts are uncommon and the incidence is usually less than 1% in rats and mice. in some adult control rats, there may be some peri-insular interstitial fibrosis that extends for short distance into exocrine pancreas. this should be distinguished from fibrosis resulting from tissue insults based on severity, distribution and the accompanying chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates. the separation of acinar hyperplasia and adenoma can be difficult and in the end may be arbitrary as these lesions seem to represent a continuum. duct-like structures do not indicate an origin from pancreatic ducts as is the case in humans. acinar architecture usually maintained or slightly altered at the most. low to high mitotic index, nuclear polymorphism and nuclear crowding possible. the incidence of eosinophilic foci is 2.6% in male F344 rats. eosinophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats. lining epithelial cells often forming papillae. protruding papillae may cause partial obliteration of the lumen. dilated tubules lined by flattened epithelium may occur. an increased number of monomorphic tall columnar mucinous cells to multilayered lesions with cribriform growth and loss of cell polarity. a grading scheme of PanIN has been introduced (Hruban et al. 2006). diagnostic features Complex of ductular structures lined by a high cuboidal epithelium resembling that of normal ductules. hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in aged rats but it is still questionable if true ductular neoplasia occurs in rats. animal models of chemical carcinogenesis revealed that rats develop acinar cell carcinomas whereas hamsters develop ductal carcinomas with the same carcinogen. this suggests that the species is a major determinant of the phenotype in carcinomas of the pancreas. duct-like structures often accompanied by a dense fibrous stroma. hyperplasia of ducts is still questionable if true ductular neoplasia occurs in rats. pancreatic intraepithelial precursor lesions in small caliber pancreatic ducts and ductal adenocarcinoma were induced by DMBA implantation in mice. a consensus report and recommendations for a standardized nomenclature with definitions and associated images was developed for the pathology of genetically-engineered mice. the exocrine pancreas is classified as a compound tubuloalveolar or compound acinar gland. the apex of pyramidal cells facing the lumen contains eosinophilic zymogen granules. the base of the pyramidal cells is basophilic due to abundant rough endoplasmic reticulum and also contains the nucleus. exocrine acini, centro-acinar cells, ductal cells and the endocrine cells within the islets have a unique ability to de-differentiate and transdifferentiate into other pancreatic histologic cell types. acinar cells store digestive enzymes in heterogeneously composed vacuoles and the release occurs in a cyclic and secretagogue-specific fashion. stokinin stimulates the exocrine pancreas to secrete inactive proenzymes. the duodenal hormone secretin stimulates the centroacinar cells. the intestinal enteropeptidases activate the trypsinogen to trypsin. lipase and amylase aid in the digestion of lipids and carbohydrates. diagnostic features Usually focal distribution. Fully differentiated non-pancreatic tissue in the pancreas. Usually circumscribed and not wholly integrated into the \u2018host\u2019 tissue. no evidence of dysplasia or history of tissue injury. acinar cell vacuolation is a reversible change and is usually a reflection of hypoxia and metabolic insults resulting in damage to mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, protein machinery, and plasma membrane. a fine cytoplasmic vacuolation, resulting from foamy appearance, may give the suspicion of phospholipidosis. lysosomes can be identified by histochemistry (for alkaline phosphatase), immunostains (for lysosomal membrane proteins, e.g. LAMP-2) or by transmission electron microscopy. phospholipidosis should only be used when confirmation by one of these techniques has been achieved. eosinophilic globules in the epithelium of an ectatic duct have been identified as Ym1/Ym2. the protein isolated from the characteristic eosinophilic lesions has been identified as Ym1/Ym2. acinar cells have foamy cytoplasm characterized by clear vesicles with eosinophilic fine granules. autophagy occurs at basal levels in all tissues to maintain cellular homeostasis. autophagy and apoptosis are not necessarily mutually exclusive entities. the exocrine acini are very sensitive to agents affecting autophagic flux. autophagy may be detected by electron microscopy, by the fluorescent localization pattern of LC3 puncta. morphologic features of cell death clearly fit with necrotic diagnostic criteria (cells and nuclei swollen, pale cytoplasm etc.) cell shrinkage with nuclear fragmentation and tingible body macrophages in apoptosis is not synonymous with necrosis. transmission electron microscopy is considered to represent the gold standard to confirm apoptosis. other confirmatory techniques include DNA-laddering (easy to perform but insensitive), TUNEL (false positives from necrotic cells) and immunohistochemistry for caspases. low grades of apoptosis may remain unrecognized by evaluation of H&E stained sections. rodents treated with synthetic cholecystokinin analog caerulein (Reid and Walker 1999; Walker et al. 1993); physical blockage of the pancreas by ductal ligation. copper-deficient diet supplemented with a copper-chelating agent (Rao et al. 1993); Azaserine (Woutersen 1996); lipopolysaccharide (Laine et al. 1996); cells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. cells swollen with pale eosinophilic cytoplasm. detachment of epithelium from submucosa. apoptosis/necrosis Synonym: Cell death Pathogenesis: Unregulated, energy independent, passive cell death with leakage of cytoplasm into surrounding tissue. inflammatory reaction (single cell necrosis) AND/OR gene regulated, energy dependent process leading to formation of apoptotic bodies which are phagocytosed by adjacent cells (apoptosis) ory depletion, acinar cell leading to shrunken acinar cells with increased basophilia. nuclei of acinar cells inactive Lack of fibrosis or adipocyte infiltration. Islets of Langerhans are unaffected. ficiency, the zymogen granules are decreased and the cells are shrunken with apparently increased basophilia due to relative predominance of the basally located basophilic cytoplasm. atrophy, acinar cell, associated with infltrate mononuclear cell may be due to spontaneous or experimentally induced degenerative changes, apoptosis, or a sequel of chronic inflammation. peri-insular acinar cells have relatively less zymogen granules and more RER when compared to peri-insular acinar cells. in certain planes of section, areas with more tele-insular regions may give a false impression of atrophy. inflammation, chronic, should be recorded only, if the inflammatory changes are the predominant component. incidence of spontaneous exocrine pancreatic atrophy is 1\u20132% in 2-year studies. chronic protein or essential amino acid deficiency, copper deficiency, zinc deficiency, ethionine, hypophysectomy or high doses of glucagon induce loss of zymogen granules and pancreatic atrophy. jured tissue even in animals with reference range serum calcium levels. metastatic calcification occurs in hypercalcemic animals throughout the body. pigment deposition, pigmentation, endogenous pigmentation, exogenous pigment deposition Pathogenesis: Diverse, dependent on nature of pigment. special stains like alizarin red S and von Kossa can help identify calcium salts. inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with additional morphological features of inflammation. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. term infiltrate (plus cell type) should be used instead of inflammation (or pancreatitis) when there is no tissue injury/reaction associated with the inflammatory cell infiltrate. also, the inflammatory cell infiltrate should be qualified with the type (name) of the cells that are predominant, such as lymphocytic, neutrophilic, etc. the most common cause of inflammation is spontaneous arteritis involving the pancreatoduodenal artery. for pancreatitis induced by xenobiotics, the pathogenesis usually involves release of inactive proenzymes from exocrine pancreas. neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. mononuclear cell atrophy is the predominant component. several animal models are used for studying pancreatitis such as choline-deficient ethionine supplemented diet. intraperitoneal or intravenous administration of secretogogues such as cholecystokinin analogue (caerulein), muscarinic receptor agonist (carbachol), anticholinesterases (organophosphate); sepsis (LPS); vascular compromise (hypovolemic shock, occlusion inflammation of the vasculature is often noted in histological sections of pancreas due to the prominent pancreato-duodenal artery and other small caliber interlobular pancreatic arteries. if present, it may be due to immune-mediated etiology as seen in spontaneously hypertensive rat strains. xanthine compounds cause focal to diffuse medial necrosis and hemorrhage especially within the small and medium-caliber mesenteric, pancreatic and renal arteries. non-vasoactive compounds like 2-amino-5-nitrophenol, nitrofurantoin, or phenacetin. diagnostic features Presence of erythrocytes in interstitial tissue, acini, ductules, or ducts. Differential diagnoses Angiectasis: Blood present within dilated vascular lumina. fed rats with raw but not heat-treated soy flour caused acinar hypertrophy. hypertrophic change progressed to hyperplasia with marked increase in DNA content. administration of isoprenaline also cased increase in pancreatic weight due to acinar cell hypertrophy. peri-insular acinar cells are more resistant (3 hours) to pilocarpine-induced degranulation than the tele-insular acinar cells (1 hour) the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. peri-insular acinar cells are more resistant (3 hours) to pilocarpine-induced degranulation than the tele-insular acinar cells (1 hour) the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. basophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats. basophilic foci have similar proliferative ability as the surrounding normal exocrine acini. basophilic foci stained positively with gamma-glutamyltranspetidase. eosinophilic foci stained negatively with gamma-glutamyltranspetidase. a microscopic morphological entity described as spontaneous pancreatic acinar hypertrophic foci in rats. metaplastic hepatic foci in the pancreas were also induced in a transgenic mouse model where KGF (FGF7) was over-expressed in the pancreas under the control of the rat insulin promoter. an increase in metaplastic hepatic foci in toxicological studies may also be due to the result of test article-induced pancreatic atrophy. the diagnosis of ductular metaplasia may be considered in those studies where a progression to ductular hyperplasia and neoplasia is noted. the lesions of duct ectasia or interlobular cystic ducts are usually secondary to chronic pancreatitis and atrophy. peri-insular interstitial fibrosis extends for short distance into exocrine pancreas. the majority of proliferative lesions in transgenic mouse models of human pancreatic cancer resemble the lesions of wildtype animals. acinar hyperplasia and adenoma are rare and age-related conditions in rats and mice. the separation of acinar hyperplasia and adenoma can be difficult and in the end may be arbitrary as these lesions represent a continuum. diagnostic features Focal lesions usually larger than an average, unchanged islet. Increased number of cells per acinus. may exhibit tinctorial variation from surrounding tissue. may exhibit tinctorial variation from surrounding tissue. eosinophilic foci are positive for ATPase and glutathione-S-transferase histochemical stains. the incidence of eosinophilic foci is 2.6% in male rats. ducts with increased number of lining epithelial cells often forming papillae. papillae may cause partial obliteration of the lumen. dilated tubules lined by flattened epithelium may occur. neoplasia (mPanINs) range from ducts lined with an increased number of monomorphic tall columnar mucinous cells to multilayered lesions with cribriform growth and loss of cell polarity. grading scheme of PanIN has been introduced (Hruban et al. 2006). diagnostic features Complex of ductular structures lined by a high cuboidal epithelium resembling that of normal ductules. hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in aged rats but it is still questionable if true ductular neoplasia occurs in rats. differential diagnosis Adenoma, acinar cell: No local invasion or metastases. hamsters develop ductal carcinomas with the same carcinogen. acinar phenotype is mostly retained but focal development of duct-like structures has been noted in a few carcinomas. a consensus report and recommendations for a standardized nomenclature was developed for the pathology of genetically-engineered mouse models of pancreatic exocrine neoplasia (Hruban et al. 2006). duct-like structures often accompanied by a dense fibrous stroma. pancreatic intraepithelial precursor lesions in small caliber pancreatic ducts and ductal adenocarcinoma were induced by DMBA implantation in mice.

Diagnostic features Focal, lobular, or diffuse. Deposits of dark basophilic granular material (on H&E) within exocrine acini, ducts or interstitium. calcification occurs in necrotic/injured tissue even in animals with reference range serum calcium levels. metastatic calcification occurs in hypercalcemic animals throughout the body. the term \u201chyaline\u201d should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of extracellular deposits hyaline material in H&E sections and the unavailability of a Congo red stain. differential diagnoses Mineralization: Dark basophilic appearance in H&E stained sections. special stains like Alizarin red S and von Kossa can help identify calcium salts. formalin-heme pigment (acid-hematin) is observed in tissues fixed in unbuffered formalin. the type of pigment can be identified by special stains, such as Schmorl\u2019s. inflammatory cell infiltrates are encountered more commonly than inflammation (pancreatitis) infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. the term inflammation (pancreatitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with tissue injury/reaction such as edema, congestion, acinar cell degranulation, necrosis, vascular fibrinoid necrosis, hemorrhage, fat necrosis or saponification. the term inflammation should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with tissue injury/reaction. mononuclear cell Infiltrate predominantly neutrophilic; frequently accompanied by edema and congestion; acinar cell degranulation and necrosis, fibrinoid necrosis of small vessels and hemorrhage may be present. other histologic features of inflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or fibroplasias will be absent. mononuclear cell or mixed infiltrate is considered to represent an inflammatory process (inflammation, mononuclear cell or inflammation, mixed) and other morphologic features associated with the infiltrate suggest an ongoing/continuing inflammatory process. the modifier \u2018chronic\u2019 may be included in the diagnosis. chronic inflammation occurs more commonly in diabetic rats than non-diabetic counterparts. chronic exposure to manganese causes chronic pancreatitis, fibrosis and acinar atrophy. mononuclear cell or combination of more than one type (Infiltrate, mixed) without other histological features of inflammation, such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or fibroplasia. inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with additional morphological features of inflammation such as edema, hemorrhage, necrosis, and/or fibroplasia. the term inflammation (pancreatitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with tissue injury/reaction such as edema, congestion, acinar cell degranulation, necrosis, vascular fibrinoid necrosis, hemorrhage, fat necrosis or saponification. there is no other histological criteria of inflammation like edema, congestion or necrosis. the term inflammation (pancreatitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with tissue injury/reaction. the term inflammation (pancreatitis) should be reserved for lesions where the inflammatory cell infiltrate is associated with tissue injury/reaction. pathogenesis usually involves release of inactive proenzymes from exocrine pancreas. infiltrate of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leukocytes into the gland parenchyma. inflammation, neutrophil Infiltrate predominantly neutrophilic; frequently accompanied by edema and congestion. infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. mononuclear cell atrophy is the predominant component. acinar cell atrophy is the predominant component. chronic inflammation occurs more commonly in diabetic rats than non-diabetic counterparts. chronic exposure to manganese causes chronic pancreatitis, fibrosis and acinar atrophy. acinar atrophy often represents the sequel of chronic inflammation. inflammation, neutrophil Infiltrate predominantly neutrophilic; frequently accompanied by edema and congestion; acinar cell degranulation and necrosis, fibrinoid necrosis of small vessels and hemorrhage may be present. infiltration of neutrophil precursors and/or abnormal neutrophils will probably be present along with mature neutrophils; infiltration of similar neoplastic cells is likely present in other organs. mononuclear cell or mixed infiltrate is considered to represent an inflammatory process (inflammation, mononuclear cell or inflammation, mixed) and other morphologic features (acinar cell atrophy and mild acinar cell degeneration, ductal proliferation, interstitial fibrosis; mineralization of acini) may be included in the diagnosis. chronic inflammation occurs more commonly in diabetic rats than non-diabetic counterparts. chronic exposure to manganese causes chronic pancreatitis, fibrosis and acinar atrophy in rats. inflammation of the vasculature is frequently noted in histological sections of pancreas due to the prominent pancreato-duodenal artery and other small caliber interlobular pancreatic arteries. arteritis lesions may be due to immune-mediated etiology as seen in spontaneously hypertensive rat strains. diagnostic features Focally extensive or diffuse. Distension of interstitial tissue forming clear spaces or spaces filled with lightly eosinophilic material. inflammatory cell infiltrate may be present in some cases. exudative edema is usually associated with tissue and vascular damage. inflammation of the vasculature is frequently noted in histological sections of pancreas due to the prominent pancreato-duodenal artery. if prominent, this may involve peri-insular exocrine tissue. xanthine compounds cause focal to diffuse medial necrosis and hemorrhage especially within the small and medium-caliber mesenteric, pancreatic and renal arteries. non-vasoactive compounds like 2-amino-5-nitrophenol, nitrofurantoin, or phenacetin cause focal to diffuse medial necrosis. rosis and hemorrhage especially within the small and medium-caliber mesenteric, pancreatic and renal arteries. non-vasoactive compounds like 2-amino-5-nitrophenol, nitrofurantoin, or phenacetin may be present. exudative edema may be exudative (inflammatory edema due to capillary injury secondary to leakage of pancreatic enzymes) or transudative (hydrodynamic derangement secondary to increased hydrostatic osmotic pressure and decreased oncotic pressure) Islet hemorrhage has been described as a spontaneous finding in Sprague-Dawley rats. if prominent, this may involve peri-insular exocrine tissue. acinar cell diffuse (same magnification as Figure 221) acinar cells with more abundant cytoplasmic volume with larger zymogen granules than tele-insular acinar cells. administration of gastrin (but not secretin analogues) also caused pancreatic acinar cell hypertrophy. peri-insular acinar cells are more resistant (3 hours) to pilocarpine-induced degranulation than the tele-insular acinar cells (1 hour) the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. these features are due to the hormones (mainly insulin) secreted by the -cells in islets of Langerhans that are locally enriched due to the insulo-acinar capillary anastomoses. the incidence of basophilic foci is 6.6% in control and 5.4% in corn oil gavage historical control male F344 rats. basophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats. the incidence of metaplastic hepatic foci is less than 1% in control rats and mice. these lesions are occasionally observed in the rat pancreas and less frequently in the mouse pancreas. metaplastic hepatic foci in the pancreas were also induced in a transgenic mouse model where KGF (FGF7) was over-expressed in the pancreas under the control of the rat insulin promoter. an increase in metaplastic hepatic foci in toxicological studies may also be due to the result of test article-induced pancreatic atrophy. the diagnosis of ductular metaplasia may be considered in those studies where a progression to ductular hyperplasia and neoplasia is noted. the lesions of duct ectasia or interlobular cystic ducts are uncommon and the incidence is usually less than 1%. interstitial fibrosis Pathogenesis: Pancreatic stellate cells reaction to acute or chronic inflammation or toxicity. Diagnostic features Focal, lobular, or diffuse. Increase in interstitial connective tissue due to pancreatic stellate cell proliferation and collagen deposition. exocrine acini (peri-insular) surrounding the islets of Langerhans has more zymogen granules and slightly larger nuclei than their distal (tele-insular) counterparts. hyperplasia, acinar cell: Increased number of cells per acinus. exocrine acini (peri-insular) surrounding the islets of Langerhans has more zymogen granules and slightly larger nuclei than their distal (tele-insular) counterparts. hyperplasia, acinar cell: Increase in DNA content. peri-insular halos are markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata. peri-insular acinar cells are more resistant (3 hours) to pilocarpine-induced degranulation than the tele-insular acinar cells (1 hour) peri-insular halos are markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. peri-insular acinar cells are more resistant (3 hours) to pilocarpine-induced degranulation than the tele-insular acinar cells (1 hour) the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. the size of peri-insular halos is markedly reduced in alloxan-induced diabetic pancreata compared to control non-diabetic rats. basophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats. basophilic foci have similar proliferative ability as surrounding normal exocrine acini. basophilic foci should not be considered preneoplastic. the incidence of basophilic foci is 6.6% in control and 5.4% in corn oil gavage historical control male F344 rats. basophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats (Roebuck et al. 1980). basophilic foci have similar proliferative ability as surrounding normal exocrine acini. basophilic foci stained positively with gamma-glutamyltranspetidase. eosinophilic foci stained negatively with gamma-glutamyltranspetidase. the incidence of metaplastic hepatic foci in the rat exocrine pancreas is less than 1% in control rats and mice. these lesions are occasionally observed in the rat pancreas and less frequently in the mouse pancreas. the incidence of metaplastic hepatic foci in the rat exocrine pancreas is less than 1% in control rats and mice. these lesions are occasionally observed in the rat pancreas and less frequently in the mouse pancreas. differential diagnoses Hyperplasia, Ductular: do not have intermixed pale exocrine acini. atrophy is usually secondary to chronic pancreatitis and atrophy. cinar ductular metaplasia is usually secondary to chronic pancreatitis and atrophy and is considered a reparative process. the diagnosis of ductular metaplasia is not commonly used in toxicologic studies since it is one of the features of atrophy. the lesions of duct ectasia or interlobular cystic ducts are uncommon. the incidence is usually less than 1% in rats and mice. these lesions usually result from blockage of inter- and intra-lobular ducts. in some adult control rats, there may be some peri-insular interstitial fibrosis that extends for short distance into exocrine pancreas. this should be distinguished from fibrosis resulting from tissue insults based on severity, distribution and the accompanying chronic inflammatory cell infiltrates. the separation of acinar hyperplasia and adenoma can be difficult and in the end may be arbitrary as these lesions seem to represent a continuum. acinar hyperplasia of ducts in circumscribed fibrous areas is often found in aged rats. focal acinar hyperplasia with cell enlargement due to increase of zymogen granules is termed \"focus, eosinophilic\" a sub-category of focal acinar hyperplasia with cell enlargement due to increase of zymogen granules has been termed \"focus, eosinophilic\" the incidence of eosinophilic foci is 2.6% in male F344 rats. eosinophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats. ducts with increased number of lining epithelial cells often forming papillae. protruding papillae may cause partial obliteration of the lumen. mucus metaplasia in hyperplastic duct epithelium may occur. a grading scheme of PanIN has been introduced (Hruban et al. 2006). hyperplasia, acinar cell (Figures 228 and 229) may exhibit tinctorial variation from surrounding tissue. may exhibit tinctorial variation from surrounding tissue. focal acinar hyperplasias have a low spontaneous incidence in rats and mice that increase with age. eosinophilic foci are thought to be part of a continuum of lesions that subsequently progress into adenomas and adenocarcinoma. eosinophilic foci are thought to be part of a continuum of lesions that progress into adenomas and adenocarcinoma. the incidence of eosinophilic foci is 2.6% in male rats. eosinophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats. acinar hyperplasias have a low spontaneous incidence in rats and mice that increase with age. transgenic mouse models of pancreatic neoplasia may develop atypical ductal hyperplasia with mucin accumulation within tall columnar cells lining the ducts. mucin accumulation within tall columnar cells lining the ducts may occur. ducts with increased number of lining epithelial cells often forming papillae. protruding papillae may cause partial obliteration of the lumen. dilated tubules lined by flattened epithelium may occur. preneoplastic lesions are termed murine pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (mPanINs) Morphologically they range from ducts lined with an increased number of monomorphic tall columnar mucinous cells to multilayered lesions with cribriform growth and loss of cell polarity. ductular structures lined by a high cuboidal epithelium resembling normal ductules do not indicate an origin from pancreatic ducts such as occurs in humans. hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in aged rats as it does in humans. rats develop acinar cell carcinomas whereas hamsters develop ductal carcinomas with the same carcinogen. acinar phenotype is mostly retained but focal development of duct-like structures has been noted in a few carcinomas. a consensus report and recommendations for a standardized nomenclature was developed for the pathology of genetically-engineered mouse models of pancreatic exocrine neoplasia. adenocarcinoma, ductal cell. Note prominent scirrhous response. Figure 241. Rat pancreas. Adenocarcinoma, ductal cell. no spontaneous ductal cell hyperplasia or neoplasia has been described. pancreatic intraepithelial precursor lesions in small caliber pancreatic ducts and ductal adenocarcinoma were induced by DMBA implantation in mice. Differential diagnoses Hyperplasia, acinar cell: No encapsulation or sharp demarcation, no or only slight alteration of acinar structure. some foci of hyperplasia may be just at the edge of an adenoma and thus categorized as such due to plane of section. hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in aged rats. it is still questionable if true ductular neoplasia occurs in rats as it does in humans. pancreatic neoplasm with ductal phenotype may occur under experimental conditions after administration with DMBA (Wendt et al. 2007), infection with reo-virus 3 (Greaves 2012), feeding a Western-style diet (Xue et al. 1996), and in transgenic mice (Kras oncogene) the acinar phenotype is mostly retained but focal development of duct-like structures has been noted in a few carcinomas. mice are relatively insensitive to the induction of pancreatic tumors with chemicals that are known to be tumorigenic in rats. squamous cell carcinoma has been experimentally induced in mice. acinar phenotype is mostly retained but focal development of duct-like structures has been noted in a few carcinomas. squamous cell carcinoma of the exocrine pancreas has been experimentally induced in mice and has morphologic features of squamous cell carcinoma. duct-like structures often accompanied by a dense fibrous stroma. hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in rats as it does in humans. pancreatic adenocarcinomas induced by DMBA implantation in rats showed strong keratin, cytokeratin 19 and cytokeratin 20 expression. no spontaneous ductal cell hyperplasia or neoplasia has been described. adenocarcinomas may occur in transgenic mice (Kras oncogene) after blockage of TGF- signalling. a consensus report and recommendations for a standardized nomenclature."}
