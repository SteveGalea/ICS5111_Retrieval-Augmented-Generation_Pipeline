{"summary": "despite the importance of cardiac energetics in HF, it remains unclear whether these metabolic changes can be normalized. male C57Bl/6 mice were subjected to either Sham or transverse aortic constriction surgery. mice with severe HF underwent a second surgery to remove the aortic constriction (debanding, DB) this maladaptive remodelling of the LV can worsen over time and eventually transition from a compensated to decompensated hypertrophy and eventually to heart failure. a hallmark of the transition from compensated to decompensated LVH is the genetic reprogramming of the metabolic pathways in the cardiomyocyte, which results in impaired cardiac energetics. at 3\u20134 weeks post-surgery, mice considered to be in severe HF [% ejection fraction (EF) 30] were then subjected to debanding (DB) surgery. an additional group of TAC mice served as controls without a DB surgery. metabolic analysis in vivo Total physical activity was measured using the Comprehensive Lab Animal Monitoring System (CLAMS/Oxymax Columbus Instruments, Columbus, OH, USA) an Oxymax treadmill (Columbis Instruments) was used to determine running capacity in mice before or 3 weeks after DB. protein (15\u201320 g) was resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. quantitative real-time PCR Cardiac mRNA expression was determined by real-time PCR using Taqman probes. experimental animals All protocols involving mice were approved by the University of Alberta Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. male C57Bl/6 mice at 8 weeks of age were randomly assigned to the Sham (n = 9) or transverse aortic constriction (TAC, n = 48) group. at 3\u20134 weeks post-surgery, mice considered to be in severe HF were then subjected to debanding (DB) surgery. echocardiography Mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and in vivo cardiac function was assessed by transthoracic echocardiography. pressure-overload was confirmed in all mice at 3-weeks after TAC by measuring trans-stenotic gradient by pulsed-wave Doppler flow. full systolic and diastolic parameters were measured either at 3\u20134 weeks TAC or at 1 or 3-weeks following DB. ex vivo heart perfusions Mice were euthanized with an intraperitoneal injection of euthanyl (120 mg/kg body weight) heart perfusions were excised and perfused in working heart mode with Krebs\u2013Henseleit buffer. protein (15\u201320 g) was resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE. data are presented as mRNA molecules per nanogram total RNA relative to the control housekeeping gene (cyclophilin; see Supplementary material online for primers used in real-time PCR). results 3.1. Removal of elevated aortic afterload improves survival and cardiac function in mice with pre-existing HF. mice subjected to TAC displayed impairments in systolic function, such as reductions in CO, stroke volume, and % fractional shortening. however, as early as 1-week following DB, all parameters of cardiac function showed improvement, with a near full recovery of systolic and diastolic function occurring by 3-weeks. d into rearing, ambulatory, and grooming) as measured by metabolic cages (n = 4\u201310).

DB mice showed higher levels of daily physical activity (evident by increased rearing) than did TAC mice. removal of elevated aortic afterload causes a regression of LVH. a hallmark of pathological hypertrophy is a shift in gene expression from the -MHC to the -MHC isoform. in all groups of mice, we measured cardiac transcript levels of these as well as other molecular markers for LVH and HF. phosphorylated proteins did not appear to be altered in our HF mice. total protein levels of Akt, mTOR, Raptor, 4E-BP1, S6 and GSK3 were significantly increased in response to pressure-overload. we observed normalized cardiac content of these regulators of protein synthesis following DB. HF is associated with alterations at the transcriptional level of metabolic enzymes that contribute to impaired cardiac energetics. HF is associated with alterations at the transcriptional level of metabolic enzymes that contribute to impaired cardiac energetics. removal of elevated aortic afterload improves cardiac oxidative metabolism in mice with pre-existing HF. levels of mcad were significantly increased (Figure 4A and B), suggesting the potential for reversibility of the transcript levels otherwise reduced by HF. mice with established HF either remained as HF controls or underwent a second surgery to remove the aortic constriction (DB) mice with established HF had a 50% survival rate of 4 weeks,13 whereas mice with HF that underwent the DB procedure had no complications associated with HF even beyond 4 weeks. at 3\u20134 weeks post-TAC, mice had a mean %EF of 21.73% compared to 52.33% for Sham controls. mice subjected to TAC displayed impairments in systolic function, such as reductions in CO, stroke volume, and % fractional shortening. vs. Sham TAC 1-week DB 3-week DB HR, b.p.m. 393.77 19.78 464.30 26.47 381.15 14.86# 388.30 10.50# Morphology Corr. 3.76 0.10* 3.55 0.15 LA diameter, mm 1.93 0.08 0.08* 2.33 0.10# 2.16 0.12# Systolic function EF, % 52.33 4.19 21.73 2.22* 35.41 3.41*,# 44.26 3.22# FS, % 29.12 1.79 10.40 1.10* 17.12 1.92* 22.06 1.83# LVEDV, L81.49 5.26 94.03 4.86 94.23 3. 1.29 15.75 1.05* 18.04 1.50 21.77 1.24# IVRT, ms 18.44 1.36 14.42 0.82 20.26 1.01# 19.17 1.16 IVCT, ms 17.24 1.34 17.98 3.51 16.12 1.69 14.64 1.21 ET, ms 49.46 2.22 43.63 6.73 45.10 1.87 48.74 2.05 n= 7\u20139 shams; n= 4\u201310 TAC; n= 7\u2013 ex vivo function HR, b.p.m. 263.40 11.80 268.92 12.00 270.36 28.41 PSP (mmHg) 69.10 0.91 59.00 2.02* 68.04 1.53*,# 71.24 1.66*,# HR PSP (103) (b.p.m. mmHg) 18.22 0.90 12.81 0.85* 18.26 0.70*,# 19.18 1.81*,# CO, mL HF exercise intolerance is a hallmark of HF severity in patients with HF. both systolic and diastolic dysfunction were returned to normal in hearts following DB of TAC mice. we investigated whether these improvements had any effect on daily physical activity or exercise capacity. a hallmark of pathological hypertrophy is a shift in gene expression from the -MHC to the -MHC isoform. in all groups of mice, we measured cardiac transcript levels of these as well as other molecular markers for LVH and HF. expression of phosphorylated proteins did not appear to be altered in our HF mice. total protein levels of Akt, mTOR, Raptor, 4E-BP1, S6 and GSK3 were significantly increased in response to pressure-overload. we observed normalized cardiac content of these regulators of protein synthesis following DB. markers of adverse cardiac remodelling without reversing cardiac fibrosis were significantly reduced in mice with pre-existing HF. HF is associated with alterations at the transcriptional level of metabolic enzymes that contribute to impaired cardiac energetics. removal of elevated aortic afterload improves cardiac oxidative metabolism in mice with pre-existing HF. compared to Sham mice, mice with HF showed significantly impaired myocardial glucose oxidation and fatty acid oxidation by 75 and 70%. a mouse model of reversible HF was performed in mice with severe HF (mean %EF of 21.73%) and the recovery period was studied for 3-weeks following DB. both glucose and fatty acid oxidation levels were restored to that of the Sham-operated group by 1-week post-DB. this indicates a very early and remarkable recovery of cardiac energy metabolism following removal of elevated aortic afterload. we investigated whether removal of elevated aortic afterload in mice with established severe HF would result in the recovery of cardiac function, substrate metabolism, and genetic reprogramming. %FS and %EF were only recovered to 76 and 85%, respectively, of Sham controls at 3-weeks post-DB. remodelling involves both concentric LVH regression and LA diameter normalization as early as 1-week following DB. ours is the first to demonstrate complete regression of LVH following severe HF. a marked reversal in the expression of cardiac stress markers (such as anf and bnp) is not irreversible. residual cardiac fibrosis remains following pressure unloading, suggesting that reduced fibrosis is not responsible for this recovery. we also measured phosphorylation of AMPK, a key regulator of cellular metabolism. we have not measured the activities of all enzymes involved in AMPK-independent mechanisms. this is not consistent with the work done by Riehle et al.49 that shows increased glucose oxidation and glycolysis rates in hearts subjected to aortic banding. despite not measuring glycolysis in the present study, we speculate that any potential changes in glycolysis in mice with HF would similarly be restored. myocardial energy reserve following HF contributes to restored diastolic function. despite this, early recovery of energy production may drive normalization of cardiac function. however, our data do not provide direct genetic or pharmacological evidence."}
