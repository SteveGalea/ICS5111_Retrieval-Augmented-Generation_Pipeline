{"summary": "in mammalian RNAi, the efficacy of each siRNA varies widely. only a limited fraction of randomly designed siRNAs is highly effective. RNAi-resistant viral mutants achieved through point mutation or deletion emerge rapidly when targeting viruses. highly conserved siRNA sequences are selected based on their degree of conservation. all possible siRNA candidates targeting every other position of user-selected viral sequences are generated and their degrees of conservation are computed. siVirus also accepts user's own sequences in a multi-FASTA format and shows whether each siRNA can target the posted sequences. highly conserved siRNA sequences are selected based on their degree of conservation, defined as the proportion of viral sequences that are targeted by the corresponding siRNA. all possible siRNA candidates targeting every other position of user-selected viral sequences are generated and their degrees of conservation are computed. a total of 4 417 157 possible siRNA candidates targeted every other position of the HIV-1 sequences were produced from the 495 viral sequences. highly conserved siRNAs constituted only 0.3% of the possible siRNAs if conservation is expected. a total of 182 sequences from HIV-1 subtypes were selected. the results were sorted by their degree of conservation. it is desirable to select an siRNA that has less off-target hits."}
