{"summary": "influenza-like illness (ILI), a syndrome comprising a range of potentially serious respiratory tract infections, contributes to mortality in patients with ESRD. but the extent to which influenza-like illness contributes to mortality in patients with ESRD has not been quantified. the ESRD data from 2000 to 2013 was used to calculate total number of deaths among patients with ESRD by quarter, from the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2000 to Q4 of 2012. the ESRD Death Notification (form CMS-2746) is submitted to the CMS within 30 days of a death. we divided each quarter\u2019s deaths by the estimated number of deaths from the smoothed spline function. we then subtracted 1 from each value and multiplied by 100. the resulting values represent quarterly relative mortality, expressed as percent increase (or decrease) compared with the average Q3 death counts. we first subtracted the average summer (Q3) ILI percentage from each Q4 and Q1 ILI percentage. in the final step, we multiplied each resulting ILI value by the appropriate parameter estimates from the regression models. to test the robustness of our findings, we performed two separate sensitivity analyses. the ESRD Death Notification (form CMS-2746) is submitted to the CMS within 30 days of a death. the data were supplemented with information from the CMS enrollment database, inpatient claims, and the Social Security Death Master File. the ESRD population increased by 62% over the study period, and the associated change in the death rates. the resulting values represent quarterly relative mortality, expressed as percent increase (or decrease) compared with the average Q3 death counts, after removal of the death trend due to the annual increase in the prevalent ESRD population. we aggregated the weekly ILI data into quarters. to test the robustness of our findings, we performed two separate sensitivity analyses. first, we assessed the effect of adding estimates of the percentage of patients with ESRD who received the influenza vaccination from 2000 to 2012. the overall trend in quarterly deaths among patients with ESRD, 2000\u20132012, is shown in Figure 2. Q4 (Q4year, blue) and Q1 (Q1year+1, black) correspond to each influenza season. relative mortality was highest for quarter 2 and Q3 for each year examined. in some years, relative mortality was similar for Q4year and Q1+1. the highest seasons were, in decreasing order, 2009\u20132010 (1604 total deaths), 2007\u20132008 (1441 total deaths), and 2010\u20132011 (1348 total deaths). the highest seasons were, in decreasing order, 2009\u20132010 (1604 total deaths), 2007\u20132008 (1441 total deaths), and 2010\u20132011 (1348 total deaths). the percentage of patients with ESRD vaccinated and vaccine effectiveness were added, separately, to the Q4 and Q1 models. the ILI parameter estimates changed little (10% and 5% respectively); corresponding P values for percentage vaccinated and vaccine effectiveness were nonsignificant. influenza seasons have been identified as contributing to this seasonal increase in health risks. the CDC ILINet36 tracks and provides timely reports of ILI incidence in the general population. the nephrology community should consider the potential merits of tracking ILI within individual dialysis units, in a fashion analogous to that undertaken by the CDC. the nephrology community should expect at most a modest benefit from any dialysis population\u2013wide influenza vaccination program. treatment and containment approaches could entail rapid detection and identification of influenza and other ILIs in patients receiving maintenance dialysis. mortality data included in the analysis was on the basis of total quarterly death counts and did not take into consideration cause of death. some causes of death that may occur more frequently in colder months could be unrelated to ILI; for example, falls resulting in severe fractures that lead to death.
