{"summary": "the idea of Jenner was so successful that today smallpox is practically eradicated. vaccines may present some lacks of efficiency and also some collateral effects. in recent years some publications wrongly associated vaccination with autism. a commonly-used model for reproducing spreading diseases dynamics in networks is the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) model. the model groups the population of individuals to be studied into three compartments according to their state: the susceptible (S), the infected (I) and the recovered (R) the model has been extensively studied under the topology of multiplex networks [27\u201330] myers [41] observed in group discussion experiments that when two individuals talk, they do not only state their opinions, but also discuss about the arguments that support their opinions. if they hold the same opinion, they could strength it by persuading each other with new arguments or reasons, becoming more extreme in their believes. we are interested in studying how the propagation of diseases is influenced by the opinion formation of individuals in favor or against of getting vaccinated. the group of individuals develop a dynamic of formation of opinions in which individuals interact expressing opinions about the importance or not of being vaccinated. to model the spread of the disease in layer A we use a variation of the SIR model in which a new stage of healthy vaccinated individual (V) is incorporated. a vaccinated individual (V) becomes infected with a probability (the infectivity of the disease), where is the effectiveness of the vaccine. if both individuals have the same opinion orientation, then with probability p: xi = 1 xi = 1, xi = 2 xi = 1. however, one assumes that if node i is a vaccinated agent, he keeps his opinion (and his vaccinated state) even when interacting with neighbor j having an opposite sign opinion. agent S becomes vaccinated V (gray) when he acquires a state of opinion 2, but then he can become I (red) with a probability and after a time tr goes to the recovered state R (blue). if the agent is infected he loses its confidence in the vaccine and thereby changes his state of opinion from 2 to 2. layer B is the social network, where the M-model rules the dynamic, with M = 2. we use an uniform distribution for the densities of opinion, i.e., the same initial probability P+2,+1,1,2 = 1/4. in layer A, we allow all the infected individuals to infect each one of their susceptible neighbors with probability. in Fig 2 we present the case r = 0.1, that mimics a scenario in which the population\u2019s opinion settles in a centralized state where the compromise process dominates. in all cases we set tr = 6 and r = 0.1 for = 0.1 (), 0.2 (), 0.4 (), 0.6 () and 0.8 (). the vaccine, the system does not present an epidemic phase and corresponds to the inflection point of the curve. for = 0.1 we need an efficiency of at least 55% in order to avoid the epidemic. even for = 1 there will be a macroscopic number of recovery individuals in the steady state. in Fig 2(d) we can see the duration time of the epidemic as a function of. as increases more nodes are vaccinated and as a consequence the duration of the disease increases. around the threshold * the time of the epidemic exhibits a peak and then decreases rapidly. Fig 3(a) shows Mag as a function of. for low values of the magnetization decreases as increases. for low values of the magnetization decreases as increases. for low values of the magnetization decreases as increases. for low values of and high values of, Mag becomes negative because of the persuasive effect, which is not negligible. agents with moderate opinion tend to convince agents with moderate opinion to become extremists. the behavior of R and the time duration of the epidemic are qualitative the same that for the two previous cases studied of r with different *. agents become extremist in their opinions and those who are against the vaccine have a small probability to be vaccinated. if a vaccinated agent is infected, its opinion becomes a negative extremist. the average opinion of the system can be in favor or against depending on the virulence, but in general it is polarized and as a consequence, Mag closed to zero. the convergence time is higher in layer B- making that the population never reach a consensus of opinions. in a society with r >> 1, persuasion dominates the process of opinion formation and the agents tend to adopt extremists opinion. the disease spreads through the non vaccinated agents very easily, even when the virulence is small. in this case, the disease spreads very easily over these agents. compromise and persuasion are the two processes involved and are controlled by the parameter r. we found an epidemic threshold * above which we ensure that an epidemic will not develop. even for = 1 there will be a final macroscopic number of recovery individuals in the steady state."}
