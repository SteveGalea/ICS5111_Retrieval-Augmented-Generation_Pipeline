{"summary": "bronchitis is an inflammation of the large airways that is characterized by cough and/or sputum that usually lasts one to three weeks. acute bronchitis is an inflammation of the large airways that is characterized by cough. virus isolated in 8\u201323% of community-based cases, not often enough to conclude that viruses are the main causal agents for acute bronchitis [6]. bacteria were detected in sputum samples in 45% of acute bronchitis patients [8, 9]. patients with typical upper respiratory infection (URI) and symptoms of influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) during the epidemic period were excluded by participating physicians. patients with typical upper respiratory infection (URI) and symptoms of influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) during the epidemic period were excluded. data collection Clinical information was collected by the investigators at outpatient clinics. data on chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, bronchiectasis (BE) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were collected by reviewing the history and medical records at the enrollment stage of the study. RT-PCR was performed using a C1000 TouchTM Thermal Cycler. primers targeting the p1 adhesin gene of M. pneumoniae and the 16S rRNA gene of C. pneumoniae were performed. PCR testing for Legionella pneumophila was performed. patients with typical upper respiratory infection (URI) and symptoms of influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) during the epidemic period were excluded by participating physicians. patients with typical upper respiratory infection (URI) and symptoms of influenza or influenza-like illness (ILI) during the epidemic period were excluded by participating physicians. data collection Clinical information was collected by the investigators at outpatient clinics. data on chronic respiratory diseases, such as asthma, bronchiectasis (BE), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were collected by reviewing the history and medical records at the enrollment stage of the study.

PCR testing for Legionella pneumophila was performed. PCR was performed using a C1000 TouchTM Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) PCR for atypical bacteria PCR assays for the detection of Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae were performed as previously described with primers targeting the p1 adhesin gene of M. pneumoniae and the 16S rRNA gene of C. pneumoniae. visits were shorter (acceptable: 6.98 days vs. unacceptable: 8.67 days, p 0.001), the sputum amount was larger (moderate to large amount; acceptable: 53.6% vs. unacceptable: 34.4%, p 0.001) lower respiratory signs, such as wheezing, crackles, rhonchi, and stridor, were more common in the acceptable sputum group. viruses were identified in 36.1% (105/291) and rhinovirus plus enterovirus (6/291) and rhinovirus plus adenovirus (4/291). PCR tests for atypical pathogens were positive in 15.1% (44/291) of patients (M. pneumoniae, n = 18; C. pneumoniae, n = 1; L. pneumophila, n = 15; and B. pertussis, n = 11). haemophilus influenzae (13.4%, 39/291) and Streptococcus pneumoniae (10.3%, 30/291) were isolated most frequently. co-infection with >1 typical bacteria was found in 6.2% (18/291) of investigated patients. mophilus parainfluenzae 5 (1.7) Group B -hemolytic Streptococcus 3 (1.0) Stenotrophomonas maltophilia 2 (0.7) Streptococcus agalactiae 1 (0.3) Other Gram negative rod 5 (1.7) Multiple typical bacterial co-infection 18 (6.2) mixed infection with at least one bacterium (typical or atypical) and at least one virus was demonstrated. microorganism Without chronic lung disease (n = 215) Chronic lung disease, Total (n = 76) COPD (n = 27) BE (n = 12) Combined lung diseases(n = 8) Virus 75 (34.9) 30 (39.5) 13 (44.8) 3 (25.0) 3 (37.5) Rhinovirus 54 (25.1) 21 (27.6) 11 (37.9) 6 (22.2) 2 (16.7) 2 (25.0) Coronavirus 9 (4.2) 2 (22.6) 2 (6.9) infection with bacteria and virus 38 (17.7) 17 (22.4) 6 (20.7) 6 (22.2) 2 (16.7) 3 (37.5) *p 0.05 for comparison with patients without underlying chronic lung disease. abbreviations: COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; BE, bronchiectasis. the prevalence of co-infection and mixed infection did not differ across the three age groups. the prevalence of co-infection and mixed infection did not differ across the three age groups. the bacteria-only group was significantly older (mean age, 52.2 vs. 43.3 years; p = 0.004) and included significantly more men (52.0% vs. 34.0%; p = 0.037) than the virus-only group. 4 Sex, male 23 (41.8) 51 (52.0) 17 (34.0) 32 (36.4) 0.037 Underlying lung disease 17 (30.9) 25 (25.5) 13 (26.0) 21 (23.9) 0.949 Symptoms Duration of cough, day 6.5 4.1 6.6 4.4 5.9 5.5 8.3 6.1 0.408 Cough Paroxysmal cough 31 (56.4) 49 (50.0) 29 (58.0) 42 (47.7) 0.357 Whooping cough 5 (9.1) 12 (12. 6 (12.0) 3 (3.4) 0.069 Chillness 7 (12.7) 8 (8.2) 2 (4.0) 7 (8.0) 0.340 Myalgia 14 (25.5) 24 (24.5) 7 (14.0) 10 (11.4) 0.138 Malaise 9 (16.4) 13 (13.3) 5 (10.0) 8 (9.1) 0.565 Chest pain 3 (5.5) 11 (11.2) 7 (14.0) 11 (12.5) 0.461 Crackle 3 (5.5) 12 (12.2) 6 (12.0) 14 onchi, stridor, and stridor were more common in acceptable sputum group. sputum was defined by satisfying Murray-Washington classification degree IV or V. sputum was defined by satisfying Murray-Washington classification degree IV or V.
