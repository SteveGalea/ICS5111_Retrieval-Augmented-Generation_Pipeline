{"summary": "in the northeast Pacific, widespread declines of Chinook (O. tshawytscha) and sockeye (O. nerka) salmon have occurred in the last 30 years, leading some populations to the brink of extirpation. it is thought that infectious disease may contribute to salmon declines. mortality of juvenile salmon can be as high as 90% transitioning from fresh water to the marine environment. this is an important observation as mortality of juvenile salmon can be as high as 90% transitioning from fresh water to the marine environment. a concerted effort to look for viruses that may contribute to mortality has been absent. emia virus and nidovirales were subject to metatranscriptomic sequencing. the sequencing revealed viral transcripts belonging to members of the Arenaviridae, Nidovirales and Reoviridae. the sequencing revealed viral transcripts belonging to members of the Arenaviridae, Nidovirales and Reoviridae. elife-47615-fig1-data5.newick (1.4KB, newick) DOI: 10.7554/eLife.47615.010 Figure 1\u2014figure supplement 1. Genome organisation, ORF prediction and (B) Genome coverage for Salmon pescarenavirus 1 and 2 (SPAV), Chinook Aquareovirus (CAV) segments 1-and Pacific salmon Nidovirus (PsNV). RT-PCR screening of >6000 wild juvenile Chinook and sockeye salmon showed dissimilar geographical distribution of infected fish. individual samples are shown at the location collected, negative samples are black, and positive samples are coloured and sized according to the virus copy number. the reovirus was detected only in farmed Chinook salmon. arenaviruses were thought to solely infect mammals. arenaviruses share less than 15% amino-acid sequence similarity to those from mammals and snakes. arenaviruses were concentrated mainly in macrophage-like cells, melanomacrophages, red-blood cells (RBCs) and endotheliocytes. these findings are consistent with localisation of arenaviruses in mammals and snakes. the virus appears to be primarily localised in the peritubular capillaries (renal portal vessels) and macrophages (arrows) scattered positive red blood cells (arrowheads) are also present (scale bar 100 m) SPAV-2 is localised to the blood, inside macrophages (arrows) and red blood cells (arrowheads) in the blood circulating in the myocardium. phylogenetic analysis of the reovirus predicts that it is part of the genus, Aquareovirus (Figure 1B) both SPAV-1 and SPAV-2 were relatively widespread along the coast of southwestern British Columbia, in ocean caught Chinook and sockeye salmon. the distribution of SPAV-1 in wild Chinook populations was more localised to the west coast of Vancouver Island than SPAV-2, which was most prevalent on the east coast of Vancouver Island. the availability of prey to juvenile sockeye in the northern Johnstone Strait is extremely low, resulting in food limitation and increased competition for prey. over 20% of moribund Chinook aquaculture fish tested positive for CAV. most detections occurred in fish at least 1.5 years after ocean entry. infection by CAV may take a considerable time to develop. infected fish either cleared the infection, or did not survive after entry into the marine environment. the second interpretation is consistent with the lower rates of ocean survival in fish produced from hatcheries versus wild salmon. Nucleic acid extractions were performed in a mixer mill (Qiagen, Maryland) on each tissue independently (five tissues- gill, liver, heart, head kidney and brain) a pool of 250 l (5 tissues contributing 50 l each) from each tissue TNES aqueous layers was processed for DNA using the BioSprint 96 DNA Blood kit (Qiagen, Maryland) and the BioSprint 96 instrument (Qiagen, Maryland) both based on manufacturer\u2019s the quantity of RNA was analysed using spectrophotometer readings. mixed tissue RNA (1 g) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using the VILO master mix kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. CC RNA Spike-In control mix 1 (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) was added to each total RNA sample prior to ribosomal depletion and library preparation. rRNA depleted total RNA was purified using the Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrate-5 kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) raw reads were sequenced using a hiSeq protocol. reads were aligned to the Atlantic Salmon genome using bwa mem (v0.7.17-r1188). unmapped reads were then balanced using Trimmomatic. novel salmon viruses were aligned with other viral genomes with shared amino acid similarity as detected by DIAMOND. the multiple protein alignments were then used as to build phylogenies using PhyML 3.0 (Guindon et al., 2015) plugin within Geneious with 100 bootstraps to generate branch support values. the maps were created using ggplot2 (Wickham, 2016) and ggmap (Kahle and Wickham, 2013). RT-PCR For all samples, resultant cDNA was combined with the normalised DNA in a ratio of 1:1. excess primers were removed by treating with exo-SAP-IT. the array was transferred to the bioMark HD instrument and processed using the GE 96 96 Standard TaqMan program for qPCR. it includes a hot start followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min (Fluidigm Corporation, CA, USA) the data were analysed with real-time PCR Analysis software (Fluidigm Corporation, CA, USA) serial dilutions were made to obtain concentrations of 24, 1.2 102, 6 102, 3 103, 1.5 104, 1.5 105 copies of the clone per reaction. clinical signs of disease and histopathological lesions were assessed for approximately 230 farmed Chinook salmon samples. the slides underwent hybridization with RNAscope probes against a portion of SPAV-1 and SPAV-2 genome. two samples which were negative for SPAV-1 and SPAV-2 were used as negative controls to confirm absence of background and (or) non-specific cross-reactivity of the assay. a pool of 250 l (5 tissues contributing 50 l each) from each of the tissue TNES aqueous layers was processed for DNA using the BioSprint 96 DNA Blood kit (Qiagen, Maryland) and the BioSprint 96 instrument (Qiagen, Maryland) both based on manufacturer\u2019s instructions. metatranscriptomic sequencing We applied a panel of host biomarkers (genes) that when co-expressed are indicative of a viral disease state (VDD) samples that displayed a positive viral disease state were selected for high throughput sequencing of RNA (dual RNA-seq) to discover new viral agents. the final library size was determined using the HS DNA chip on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. sample libraries were normalised to 4 nM, pooled appropriately and denatured and diluted to obtain a final library of 17pM. a paired-end 251 bp sequencing run was performed on the Illumina MiSeq System (Illumina, San Diego, CA) phylogeny of each virus was resolved based on predicted replicase (CAV and SPAV) and ORF1ab (PsNV) amino acid sequences. phylogeny of each virus was resolved based on the predicted replicase (CAV and SPAV) and ORF1ab (PsNV) amino acid sequences. qPCR Taqman assays were designed using default parameters (Supplementary file 1). These assays were then tested using the Fluidigm BioMark microfluidics-based qPCR system following the same protocol as described below. the most consistent assay was chosen and APC standards were constructed to include in future Fluidigm BioMark microbe panels. five l of assay mix was prepared for each sample containing 1 TaqMan Universal Master Mix (No UNG), 1 GE Sample Loading Reagent (Fluidigm PN 85000746) and 1 Assay Loading Reagent (Fluidigm PN 85000736) controls were added prior to running the dynamic array. l of 2X TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (ABI PN 4369016), 4.3 l of water, 0.22 l of mixed forward and reverse primers. temperature cycles included one 2 min hold (50\u00b0C), a 10 min denaturation (95\u00b0C), and 40 cycles of denaturation (95\u00b0C for 15 s), annealing and extension (60\u00b0C for 60 s) in Situ Hybridization (ISH) RNA-ISH was performed using RNAscope 2.5 HD Duplex assay (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, California, USA, catalog# 322500) the slides underwent hybridization with RNAscope probes against a portion of SPAV-1 and SPAV-2 genome (Advanced Cell Diagnostics, Newark, California, USA, catalog#512391) geneme British Columbia SSHI to Gideon J Mordecai, Kristina M Miller, Emiliano DiCicco, Angela D Schulze, Karia H Kaukinen, Tobi J Ming, Shaorong Li, Amy Tabata, Amy Teffer.
