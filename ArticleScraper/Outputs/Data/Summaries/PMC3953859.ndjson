{"summary": "ARDS is a serious clinical disorder with high mortality (30%-60%). risk factors include septicemia, acid aspiration, infection, traumatic injury, fat embolism, ischemia/reperfusion. ARDS is the most devastating form of acute lung injury (ALI). the cushing[31,32] responses including systemic hypertension, bradycardia and irregular respiration (dyspnea and apnea) have been used as signs of intracranial hypertension (ICH) in anesthetized dogs, we employed total heart bypass and found that ICH resulted in constriction of the systemic and pulmonary resistance. the most severe cases were found in patients with brain stem distortion, hemorrhage and infarction. acute PE could complicate brain injury in four child cases. this serious clinical problem has been overlooked by most clinicians. ICH caused vasoconstriction of resistance and capacitance vessels in the systemic and pulmonary circulation. the hemodynamic alterations have elaborated the classic Cushing[31,32] responses including systemic hypertension, bradycardia and intermittent apnea. a scintiphotographic study was performed by intravenous injection of a specific isotope, indium-113m. the radioactive isotope forms a large molecular complex with plasma transferrin and is evenly distributed inside the circulatory system. the splanchnic beds were the major site of vasoconstriction. isolated lung preparation was used alone or in combination with the whole rodent model. results suggest NO is detrimental to the lung in air embolism. hypoxia-induced pulmonary vasoconstriction has been a well-known physiological phenomenon. a detector probe for NO was placed in the pulmonary vein and lung tissue in isolated perfused rat\u2019s lungs. the findings suggest continuous NO release from the lung maintains pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) iNOS is toxic to the endothelium in the pulmonary microvasculature in isolated perfused lungs subjected to ischemia/reperfusion[61]. administration of red blood cells and hemoglobin into the isolated lung as well as static inflation attenuated the ALI following hypoxia or ischemia/reperfusion[9,57]. subjects developed signs of respiratory distress and progressive loss of consciousness. Chest radiography on admission revealed clear lung. 21 of these children developed severe dyspnea, hyperglycemia, leukocytosis. the pathology included alveolar hemorrhage, myocarditis, portal inflammation and interstitial nephritis. antigen retrieval immunohistochemical stain disclosed iNOS expression in the alveolar type 1 cells, myocardium, hepatocytes and renal tubules. biochemical determinations suggested multiple organ damage. hypercalcemia caused severe ALI in conscious rats and isolated lungs. RT-PCR found marked increase in iNOS mRNA expression in lung parenchyma. hypercalcemia also increased plasma nitrate/nitrite, methyl guanidine and proinflammatory cytokines. iNOS inhibitors and/or iNOS-knockout animals have supported the contention that NO/iNOS is responsible for the oxidative stress and endothelial damage in the ARDS/ALI caused by endotoxin, ozone exposure, carrageenan treatment, acute hypoxia, bleomycin administration, acid aspiration and other challenges[11,87-96]. pulmonary embolic disorders such as fat and air embolism are less common causes. gastric aspiration occurs frequently in surgical patients under anesthesia and other causes such as blunt thoracic trauma. amphetamine and oleic acid have been employed for the induction of ALI[119-122] oleic acid may be a predictor or prognostic factor for ARDS[116,125]. oleic acid may be a predictor or prognostic factor for ARDS. a study focused on the potential toxic effects of high oxygen fractions on inspired air. several review articles and monographs have addressed the issue of possible therapeutic regimen. the modalities include extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, prone position, mechanical ventilation with appropriate tidal volume and respiratory pressure, fluid and hemodynamic management and permissive hypercapnic acidosis. regular exercise training attenuates septic responses such as systemic hypotension. increases in plasma nitrate/nitrite, methyl guanidine, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, amylase, lipase, asparate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, lactic dehydrogenase, and IL-1. exercise training also abrogates the cardiac, hepatic and pulmonary injuries caused by end pentobarbital also reduced cell aptosis caused by deforoxamine-induced hypoxia. niacinamide or niacinamide abrogates ALI caused by ischemic/reperfusion or endotoxin by mechanism through inhibition on poly (ADP-ribose) synthase. -acetylcysteine prevented the ALI caused by fat embolism[98]. the clinical adaptation of results from animal studies requires further investigations. the pathogenesis of ALI/ARDS is complex. adrenergic agonists are able to accelerate lung fluid and ion removal and to stimulate surfactant secretion. there are reports on the actions of vascular endothelial growth factor."}
