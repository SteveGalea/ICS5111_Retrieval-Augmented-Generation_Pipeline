{"summary": "autoimmune inflammation of the CNS in multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), is mediated by antigen specific Th1 and Th17 cells. monoclonal antibodies (natalizumab) to the 4 subunit of the integrin VLA-4 were successfully used to prevent the influx of immune cells into the CNS. distinct encephalitogenic T cell subsets vary in their equipment with VLA-4. blockade of VLA-4 is more efficient in preventing the recruitment of Th1 cells than of Th17 cells into the CNS parenchyma. however, preclinical models to investigate niche specific immune surveillance and host defense in the CNS are rare. access of Th1 cells into the infected CNS compartment was dependent on VLA-4 expression. integrin targeted therapeutic interventions in autoimmunity and chronic inflammation need to be refined. mice were treated with every other day i.p. injections of a neutralizing antibody to IFN- (R4-6A2, BioXCell, West Lebanon, USA; 200 g) blocking antibodies to integrin 4 (PS/2, BioXCell, West Lebanon, USA; 200 g), depleting antibodies to CD8 (YTS169.4, BioXcell; 200 g) were administered every other day from day 9 or day 10 after immunization. Virus strains Replication competent VV Western Reserve strain (VV) was provided by B Moss. vv and replication deficient Modified Vaccinia Virus Ankara strain used in this study were propagated and titered according to standard methodology [21] the brain including cerebellum was dissected and the spinal cord flushed out with PBS by hydrostatic pressure. mononuclear cells were isolated by passing the tissue through a cell strainer (70 m) for isolation of mononuclear cells from spleen, spleens were mashed through a cell strainer (70 m) cells were fixed and permeabilized (Cytofix/Cytoperm and Perm/Wash buffer, BD Biosciences) followed by staining with monoclonal antibodies to mouse IL-2, IL-17, or IFN- (BD Biosciences) and flow cytometric analysis (CYAN, Beckmann/Coulter). RNA was extracted from magnetic bead-purified or flow cytometry-sorted cells ex vivo or after in vitro differentiation using RN the gene expression was normalized to the expression of -actin. western blotting T cells were lysed and denatured using RiPA buffer. membranes were incubated with primary antibodies to Prf-1 (ab7203, Abcam) and -actin (Abcam) retroviral transduction of T cells pMIG Eomes (GFP) and control pMIG (GFP) retroviral constructs were a kind gift from SL Reiner (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) and FJ Quintana (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA) retroviral supernatants were collected two days post transfection. serial dilutions in RPMI-1640 medium containing 10% FCS were added in duplicates to 90% confluent RK-13 cells seeded in 6-well plates. Plaques were counted after crystal violet staining. all serum samples were heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min prior to testing. mice, Prf1 -/- mice, and wild type C57BL/6 mice were obtained from Jackson Laboratories. mice were immunized by subcutaneous injection of 100 l of an emulsion of 1 108 IU MVA or PBS in complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. animals were kept in a specific pathogen-free facility at the Technische Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnchen. all experimental protocols were approved by the standing committee for experimentation with laboratory animals. cytokines were added to the differentiation cultures as indicated. human TGF-1 (2 ng/ml) and mouse IL-6 (50 ng/ml) for Th17. mouse IL-12 (10 ng/ml) and anti-IL-4 (10 g/ml) for Th1, all R&D Systems. intracellular cytokine staining Cells were stimulated in culture medium containing phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA, 50 ng/ml, Sigma), ionomycin (1 g/ml, Sigma) and monensin (GolgiStop 1 l/ml, BD Biosciences) at 37\u00b0C and 10% CO2 for 4 hours. staining was performed on an automated Leica BOND-MAX instrument RNA was extracted from magnetic bead-purified or flow cytometry-sorted cells ex vivo or after in vitro differentiation using RNeasy columns. the gene expression was normalized to the expression of -actin. western blotting T cells were lysed and denatured using RiPA buffer (Sigma-Aldrich) single cells were restimulated with a mixture of I-Ab-restricted VV peptides. cells were seeded on a 12 well flat-bottom plate at a density of 2 106 cells/well. retroviral supernatants were collected two days post transfection. atant and 4 g/ml polybrene (Merck Millipore) were added to the pre-committed Th17 cells. a spin transduction was performed (2000 rpm, RT, 1 hour) cells were further cultured for 3 days in Th17 polarizing conditions. intrathecal vaccinia virus (VV) infection causes lethal encephalitis. female C57BL/6 mice were injected intrathecally with VV by suboccipital puncture. wild type mice injected with VV were subjected to histologic analyses on day 5 after infection. scale bars represent 200 m in the low magnification and 20 m in the higher magnification photomicrographs. infected mice with recombinant VV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (VV eGFP) wild type mice were infected intrathecally with 1.000 PFUs of VV (eGFP), a replication competent recombinant VV expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) in infected cells. mice were sacrificed, and spleen and CNS mononuclear cells were isolated. sham-immunized mice died at day 6 after infection. MVA immunized animals harbored both antigen specific CTLs and CD4+ T cells in the CNS and recovered from VV encephalitis. protective immunity against intrathecal VV infection was associated with the mobilization of both CTLs and CD4+ effector T helper cells to the CNS. specificity to the VV MHC class I restricted epitope B8R by multimer staining and to their IL-17 and IFN- cytokine status by intracellular cytokine staining in the CD3+CD8+ CTL and CD3+CD4+ T helper cell compartment respectively. in the EAE model, Th1 cells depend on 4-integrins in order to enter into the CNS during autoimmune inflammation. anti-integrin 4 treated mice were sham immunized (PBS/CFA) or immunized with MVA/CFA followed by intrathecal VV challenge on day 10 after immunization. integrin 4 mediated mechanisms appeared redundant for recruitment of effector CD8+ T cells into the infected CNS. we compared the fractions of antigen specific T cells on day 10 after subcutaneous immunization with MVA/CFA in the spleens of CD4 Cre - x Itga4 flox/flox (wild type control) versus CD4 Cre + x Itga4 flox/flox (4 CKO) mice. we challenged MVA immune and CD8+ depleted wild type and 4 CKO mice with i.th. VV. 4-integrin deficient T helper cells re-isolated from the CNS of VV challenged mice exhibited a Th17 like phenotype. the number of Th1 like cells was significantly reduced in 4 CKO animals as compared with controls. efficacy of CD8+ T cell depletion was analyzed by flow cytometry in CNS mononuclear cells (gate on CD3+CD19- cells) the viral load in the CNS was measured by plaque assay. cytokine positive CD4+ T cells (E) were calculated by surface staining and intracellular cytokine analysis. antigen specific Th1 cells were polarized in vitro under i.th. virus infection. on day four of differentiation, activated T cells were transferred into Rag1-/- mice, which had been infected with a recombinant VV expressing ovalbumin one day earlier. we screened the expression profile of highly purified CD4+ effector T cells isolated from the CNS of VV challenged wild type vs 4 CKO mice for molecules directly involved in virus defense. the expression of perforin-1 (Prf1) was markedly reduced in 4-integrin deficient as compared with wild type T helper cells. the failure of Th17 cells to express Prf1 was due to reduced Eomes expression. the failure of Th17 cells to express Prf1 was due to lack of Prf1 expression. mRNA levels were reduced in CD4+ T cells isolated from 4 CKO mice. Prf1 protein expression was determined by Western Blot in Th0, Th1 and Th17 cells from day 3 to day 5 of culture. RNA levels of Eomes were measured in wild type and 4 integrin deficient T cells isolated from the CNS of VV infected mice. wild type mice that were vaccinated with MVA and then depleted of CD4+ T cells succumbed to viral encephalitis. Prf1-/-mice succumb to VV encephalitis. wild type and Prf1-/- mice were immunized with MVA/CFA. mice were continuously depleted of CD8+ T cells. intrathecal infection with VV causes lethal encephalitis. wild type mice were injected intrathecally by suboccipital puncture of the cisterna magna with various doses of VV. infected CD11b+CD45high macrophages expressed MHC class II. phagocytic cells were recruited from the systemic compartment in response to i.th. VV infection. mice were infected intrathecally with 1.000 PFUs of VV (eGFP) mice were sacrificed and spleen and CNS mononuclear cells were isolated. sham-immunized mice died at day 6 after infection and failed to recruit either CD4+ T helper cells or VV-specific CTLs into the CNS compartment. protective immunity against intrathecal VV infection was associated with the mobilization of both CTLs and CD4+ effector T helper cells to the CNS. CNS derived T cells were analyzed as to their specificity to the VV MHC class I restricted epitope B8R by multimer staining and to their IL-17 and IFN- cytokine status. numbers indicate percentages of cells in the depicted gates or quadrants. the absolute number of CD4+ T cells was reduced in the CNS. the number of CTLs recruited to the CNS compartment was not significantly reduced in anti-integrin 4 treated mice. integrin 4 mediated mechanisms appeared to be redundant for the recruitment of effector CD8+ T cells into the infected CNS. intracerebral reconstitution of CD4+ effector T helper cell responses has been proposed to be necessary for efficient clearance of various viruses from the CNS including JC virus. we combined a system of T cell conditional ablation of 4-integrin expression (CD4 Cre + x Itga4 flox/flox mice, 4 CKO mice) with antibody mediated depletion of CD8+ T cells. 4 CKO mice were immunized with MVA immune and CD8+ depleted wild type and 4 CKO mice with i.th. VV. CD4+ effector T helper cells failed to control virus replication in the CNS of 4 CKO mice. 8+ T cells challenged i.th. with VV after intrathecal infection. weight loss was calculated as percentage of initial body weight. on day 5 after infection, mice were sacrificed. despite significant difference in clinical outcome, equal amounts of transferred Th1 cells and Th17 cells were re-isolated from the CNS of infected mice. so, on a per cell basis, antigen specific Th1 cells appeared to be more potent in alleviating i.th. virus infection than antigen specific Th17 cells. on day four of differentiation, activated T cells were transferred into Rag1-/- mice. mice recovered from VV encephalitis despite ablation of IFN-. efficiency of IFN- blockade was documented by reduced levels of MHC class II expression on microglial cells in the CNS compartment. expression of Prf1 has been reported to depend on the expression of the transcription factor eomesodermin (Eomes) [26], we measured RNA levels of Eomes in CD4+ T cells isolated from 4 CKO mice. polarized Th17 cells in vitro and overexpressed Eomes by retroviral transduction. levels of Prf1 RNA expression were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. RNA levels of Eomes were measured in wild type and 4 integrin deficient T cells isolated from the CNS of VV infected mice. wild type and Prf1-/- mice were immunized with MVA/CFA and continuously depleted of CD8+ T cells after intrathecal VV challenge. wild type mice succumbed to intrathecal challenge with VV. intrathecal infection of naive wild type C57BL/6 mice with VV was lethal because adaptive antiviral immune responses did not develop upon i.th. infection alone. adaptive immune responses did not develop upon i.th. infection alone. distinct T helper cell subsets use distinct integrins to access the CNS compartment in autoimmune inflammation. the entry of Th17 cells in the subarachnoid space most likely requires CCR6 and LFA-1 but is independent of VLA-4 [4,38] KO mice succumbed to intrathecal VV challenge because they failed to recruit Th1 cells into the CNS. antigen specific CD4+ T cells communicated with virus infected macrophages within the CNS parenchyma. cytotoxic effects of antigen specific CD4+ T cells were also reported in systemic VV infection. IL-2 promotes the expression of granzyme B and perforin-1 and boosts cytotoxic capacity of CD4+ T cells. perforin-1 expression in Th1 cells is associated with Eomes and overexpression of Eomes in Th1 cells partially reconstituted perforin-1 expression. lack of perforin-1 expression may not be the only mechanism to impair antiviral capacity. de or genetic lack of 4-integrins on T cells selectively modulated the access of T cell subsets to the CNS. i.th. inoculation of VV does not represent a natural route of CNS infection. i.th. VV infection results in an acute encephalomyelitis. authors' contributions TK, VR and AM designed the study and wrote the manuscript. GG, FP, MH, BH and ID gave conceptional input. weight courses of infected animals were measured every day after infection. expression of MHC class II on microglial cells was measured on day 6 after infection using surface staining and flow cytometric analysis. is recipient of a Heisenberg award by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft. this work was supported by SyNergy and other grants from the DFG."}
