{"summary": "aerosolized rhinovirus is the most common cause of upper respiratory tract infections. the method of transmission of rhinoviruses is disputed. some studies have demonstrated that aerosol transmission is a likely method of transmission. rhinoviruses have been implicated in the exacerbation of asthma symptoms [4] and may even play a role in asthma related deaths [5] rhinoviruses have been thought to be transmitted via large droplets or contact [7] studies in the 1980's demonstrated that fomites are not an effective means of transmitting rhinovirus infections. UVGI was not effective against the highly contagious measles virus when children had extensive contact in buses and crowded tenements [26,27]. therefore, it fell into disfavor and has not been extensively employed nor has it been studied using molecular methods of detecting its efficacy. the nebulizing solution consists of PBS, diluted virus, and 0.05 g/l uranine. the nebulizing solution consists of 0.05 g/l uranine. we used the uranine as a fluorescent tracer. a UV fixture containing six 36-watt UV lamps (Lumalier, Memphis, Tennessee) sits on which a slide contains three ports. one port is used to collect the aerosol sample with our sampling filters. the other ports can be loaded with two Teflo filters in series. irradiance level of 30 mW/m2 for 22.8 s for a UV dose of 684 mJ/m2. for spiking, 1 l methanol was placed on the filter as a wetting agent followed by 1 l of diluted virus. we also spiked one filter prior to each aerosol chamber run as a positive control. the PCR mixture contained 2 reaction buffer (0.4 mM of each dNTP, 2.4 mM MgSO4), 1 l of each primer (0.2 M), 1 l RT/PLATINUM Taq Mix and 10 l of the RNA template in a final volume of 50 l. the PCR mixture contained 2 reaction buffer (0.4 mM of each dNTP, 2.4 mM MgSO4), 1 l of each primer (0.2 M), electrophoresis analysis on agarose gel containing 8 l of ethidium bromide per 200 ml of gel followed by examination under UV light. primer pair of OL26 and OL27 generates a 388 base pair amplicon from within the original amplicon. uranine was collected in a specially designed aerosolization chamber. the nebulizing solution consists of PBS, diluted virus, and 0.05 g/l uranine. the aerosol was generated in a specially designed aerosolization chamber. the chamber consists of four parts: a drying jar, a 165 mm square duct, a UV exposure chamber, and sampling ports. we attached a Collison nebulizer to the drying jar, where the aerosol is given time to dry, before entering the square duct through a 9-port manifold. air was pumped through a Teflon filter prior to entering the chamber. the experimental chamber was housed within a class II, Type A biosafety cabinet. airflow through the chamber was maintained at 8.5 l/min for 10 minutes. RNA extraction We placed the filters face down in a 60 mm petri dish using sterile forceps. we then added 560 l of prepared AVL buffer containing carrier RNA (Qiagen QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit) and 140 l phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after placing the lids on the dishes, the dishes were secured to an orbital tabletop shaker (VWR Scientific Products, Thorofare, New Jersey) tier Thermal Cycler programmed with an initial cDNA synthesis and pre-denaturation step of 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes and 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes. then 36 cycles of denature, annealing and extension (15 s at 94\u00b0C, 30 s at 55\u00b0C, 30 s at 68\u00b0C) PCR mixture contained 2 reaction buffer (0.4 mM of each dNTP, 2.4 mM MgSO4), 1 l of each primer uranine analysis was conducted on three filters per sampling run. the filters were removed from cassette holders and placed into a 100 mm test tube. we added 5 ml of PBS to each tube and sonicated for an hour with vortexing every 15 minutes. the expected TCID50 was adjusted for the yield for the uranine samples. dilution gradient filters spiked with 25 TCID50/filter. no signal was detected from samples with 0.5 TCID50/filter.

RT-PCR method did not detect a difference between UV exposed and nonexposed rhinoviral aerosols. it is possible that the UV irradiation damaged other regions of the viral RNA and not the region that our primers amplified. the limit of detection of our assay must be put into context with the amount of virus shed by an infectious individual. researchers inoculated volunteers in the nose with both nasal drops and an aerosol. the authors estimated a human ID50 of 0.032 TCID50 for nasal drops and 0.68 TCID50 for aerosols. if we assume that the infectious dose is acquired through an aerosol, the aerosol data from 1966 suggests that our assay can detect an amount approximately equal to twice the ID50 in humans. tissue culture infectious dose 50% UVGI \u2013 Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation Competing interests None declared Authors' contributions TM participated in the study design, the modification of the chamber, and performed the aerosol experiments and molecular assays."}
