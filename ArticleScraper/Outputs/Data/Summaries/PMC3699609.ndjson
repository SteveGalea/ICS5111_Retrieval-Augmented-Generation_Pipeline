{"summary": "the realAmp method was found to be simpler and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification. sensitivity and specificity of realAmp in detecting A. baumannii was 98.9% and 75.0%, respectively. Acinetobacter baumannii, one of the important nosocomial pathogens, is often associated with epidemic outbreaks of infection. the organism is often pandrug-resistant and capable of causing substantial morbidity and mortality in patients with severe underlying diseases, both in the hospital and in the community. the method is more suitable than PCR for rapid detection of A. baumannii. the results showed that the LAMP method was more suitable than PCR for rapid detection of A. baumannii. the VITEK 2 system uses a fluorescence-based technology for routine identification of gram-negative bacteria [15]. Methods Ethics Statement Samples were obtained from First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and State Key Laboratory of Respiratory Diseases, Guangzhou Medical College. informed written consent was obtained from each subject. one hundred and sixty-two spontaneous early-morning sputa were qualified. ninety sputum samples identified as A. baumannii positive and 72 sputum samples as A. baumannii negative were used to assess the realAmp assay. offii c 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae c 1 Hemophilus influenzae c 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia c 1 Proteus mirabilis c 1 Gram-positive organisms Staphylococcus aureus ATCC25923 a 1 Staphlococcus epidermidis c 1 Enterococcus faecium c 1 Enterococcus faecalis c primers forward outer primer (F3), backward outer primer (B3), forward internal primer (FIP), backward internal primer (B3) and loop backward primer (LB) were designed by targeting the conserved regions of the pgaD gene of A. baumannii. primer specificity was checked using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) against human DNA. each sputum sample was liquefied in 3 times volume of 4% NaOH. one milliliter of the liquefaction of sputum was moved into 1.5 ml tube. then centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 minutes and precipitate collected. realAmp method was performed using the commercially available DNA thermostatic amplification kit (Guangzhou Diao Bio-technology Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China) amplification was performed in 25 L total volume containing 2reaction buffer (40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.8, 20 mM KCl, 16 mM MgSO4, 20 mM (NH4)2SO4). sensitivity and specificity of realAmp method was calculated using both VITEK 2 system and a conventional PCR assay [14] sensitivity and specificity were calculated using 95% Confidence Intervals (95%CI) for both sensitivity and specificity were calculated. from 100 ng/L to 1 pg/L to assess the correlation between time to amplification and amount of target DNA. overnight cultures were serially diluted (ten-fold) in Luria\u2013Bertani broth from starting inocula of 1107 CFU/mL to 101 CFU/mL before DNA extraction. 1 Escherichia coli ATCC35218 a 1 Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU b 1 + Acinetobacter genomic species 3 b 1 Acinetobacter junii c 2 Acinetobacter lwoffii c 2 Klebsiella pneumoniae c 1 Enterobacter cloacae c 1 Pseudomonas maltophilia c 1 Pseudomonas cepacia Burk all 30 clinical A. baumannii isolates examined had the pga genes by PCR analysis. the primers forward outer primer (F3), backward outer primer (B3), forward internal primer (FIP), backward internal primer (BIP) and loop backward primer (LB) were designed by targeting conserved regions of the pgaD gene of A. baumannii (GeneBank accession numbers: FJ866500, CP003856, CP003500, the primer specificity was checked using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) against human DNA. each sputum sample was liquefied in 3 times volume of 4% NaOH, placed 40 minutes at room temperature after strong vibration. s each, 0.5 units of Taq Polymerase (Takara Co. Ltd., Japan) and 2 L of DNA as the template. DNA amplification was carried out at 63\u00b0C for 60 minutes using the ESE-Quant Tube Scanner. the lified product weighs about 1 kg with the dimensions 74 mm178 mm188 mm. the unit is completely portable and can be operated with a Li-Ion rechargeable power pack without external power supply. the device can also be used together with a computer to generate real time amplification plots as the reaction progresses. sensitivity of the realAmp and PCR assays for the detection of A. baumannii ATCC19606. The plot reported the fluorescence in millivolts (mV) on the Y-axis and time in minutes on the X-axis. the realAmp assay for the detection of A. calcoaceticus\u2013A. baumannii complex. the plot reported the fluorescence in millivolts (mV) on the Y-axis and time in minutes on the X-axis. VITEK 2 system: a fluorescence-based automated identification system. realAmp: real-time loop-mediated isothermal amplification. PCR: polymerase chain reaction. the lower limit of detection of RealAmp determined using DNA obtained from A. baumannii ATCC19606 was 1103 CFU/mL, but the conventional PCR only 1104 CFU/mL. more time to amplification was required for clinical sputum samples with lower bacterial content. the results showed that the RealAmp assay could effectively differentiate A. baumannii from 18 strains of other non-Acinetobacter genera. the plot reported the fluorescence in millivolts (mV) on the Y-axis and time in minutes on the X-axis. realAmp assay showed 98.9% (95% CI: 94.0\u201399.8%) sensitivity and 75.0% (95% CI: 63.9\u201383.6%) specificity when compared to the PCR assay. sensitivity of conventional PCR and realAmp was similar, when compared to VITEK 2 system data. multiplex PCR can achieve simultaneous detection of multiple agents that cause similar or identical clinical syndromes in a single test. however, multiplex PCR can pose several difficulties, including poor sensitivity or specificity and preferential amplification of certain specific targets. real-time PCR assay have many advantages over conventional PCR. the natural habitats of A. baumannii and Acinetobacter genomic species 13TU are unknown. the species-specific primers were designed to distinguish A. baumannii from Acinetobacter calcoaceticus and Acinetobacter genomic species 3. the realAmp assay could differentiate between A. baumannii and Acinetobacter calcoaceticus. the slower rate of metabolism of A. baumannii could cause weaker fluorescent biochemical reactions in the reaction wells of VITEK 2 ID-GNB cards.
