{"summary": "the first outbreak has subsided, but four subsequent seasonal epidemics were observed in china. the severe illness of H7N9 infections and the presence of natural reservoirs represent significant concerns. the identification of vulnerable subjects is paramount to the prevention of spread. age-dependent changes in the airway epithelium mean older patients may be more prone to respiratory tract infections [16] and the development of symptomatic H7N9 disease. comorbidities is the only independent risk factor for acute respiratory distress syndrome in H7N9-infected individuals. human respiratory tract primary epithelial cells were cultured from patients undergoing upper or lower airway surgery and experimentally infected with H7N9. the limited amount of primary epithelial cells available from each patient meant that only H7N9 virus infection was conducted. the viral RNA quantity was determined to represent changes in viral titer at each time point. dm virus or H7N9 virus-infected supernatants reached a plateau between 48 and 72 h p.i. differences in viral RNA quantities were not significant at each time point in the same NHBE cells. a Wilcoxon signed rank test to evaluate their difference between various time points. aP 0.05 was used to evaluate the difference between different time points. 82.87 11.28 93.1 3.79 8.16 0.55 0.061 90.07 10.2 88.83 31.91 44.41 4.84 0.099 72 h p.i. 108.42 16.02 119.69 8.8 19.46 4.1 0.051 74.7 3.2 74.36 4.72 13.15 2.09 0.066 IL-8 (pg/mL) 24 h p.i. 0.1 0 6.88 3.89 4.95 0.54 0.126 0.1 0 0.1 0 3.61 0.20 0.022 48 h p.i. 0.1 0 78.64 4.42 88.43 22.87 0.055 0.1 0 0.1 0 3.84 0.53 0.022 72 h p.i. 6.07 0.63 668.35 1.65 377.47 76.11 0.027 0.1 0 0.1 0 3.01 0.13 IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, IFN-, interferon gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10) and TNF-. these molecules are also produced by human airway epithelial cells [30\u201334] and are termed \u201ccore cytokines\u201d in the present study.

Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to analyze the associations between patient-related characteristics, viral RNA quantities, and cytokine levels. all statistical calculations were performed with the G*Power 3.1.9.2 software (Heinrich-Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany), the IBM SPSS (version 23; International Business Machines Corp.) and the GraphPad Prism for Windows (version 7.0; GraphPad Software, Inc.) software packages."}
