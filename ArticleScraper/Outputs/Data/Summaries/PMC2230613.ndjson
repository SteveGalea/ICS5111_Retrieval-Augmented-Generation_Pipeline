{"summary": "sepsis and septic shock are among the most common causes of morbidity and mortality in intensive care. despite dramatic improvements in diagnostic and treatment procedures, mortality rates among patients with sepsis remained unchanged from the 1960s through to the late 1990s. a trend toward decreasing mortality has been observed during the past few years. a high score indicating a septic condition did not necessarily predict a patient's outcome, even though that outcome might be affected by sepsis-related organ dysfunction. findings prompted experts to propose new scoring systems aimed at identifying patients at risk for developing severe sepsis or shock. a single lactate measurement above 4 mmol/l predicted short-term and in-hospital risk for death in patients presenting at the ED with suspected infection [20], even in those with normal arterial blood pressure [21]. plasma procalcitonin is a more specific test than C-reactive protein [22] and interleukin-6. fewer than 50% of patients received antibiotics during the first 4 hours. as many as 17% received antimicrobial treatment after hour 6. a recent retrospective analysis quantified the impact of delayed antimicrobial treatment in patients with severe sepsis. effective antimicrobial management requires good microbiologic sense. the usual microbiologic techniques of detection may lack effectiveness. urine antigens to Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila type 1 can help in patients with pneumonia. use of albumin infusion is potentially cost-effective in patients with septic shock. it currently lacks the support needed for it to be recommended for use in patients with septic shock. transfusion of packed red cells may also be considered in septic patients. use of vasopressors has been associated with poorer outcomes in septic patients, but their influence on mortality was unclear [58] professional associations have proposed guidelines that allow an opportunity to administer epinephrine or a combination of norepinephrine and dobutamine to more severely ill patients. a landmark study conducted by rivers and coworkers emphasized this concept in the field of sepsis. the landmark study emphasized this concept in the field of sepsis. a number of ED and ICU teams changed their daily care in accordance with the study protocol. a number of recent reports have identified the fact that EDs are increasingly overburdened. this can compromise the quality of care delivered to patients. early administration of antimicrobial therapy was poorly adhered to, even in recent reports. use of packed red cells to improve ScvO2 may be offset by its potential harm. but in setting of severe sepsis and septic shock the theoretical risks appear balanced by the benefits in terms of tissue oxygenation [85] recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) and low-dose steroids have failed to improve patients' conditions despite positive preclinical data. rhAPC was initially designed to compensate for a deficit in the natural anticoagulant protein C during sepsis. it limited organ failures and improved the survival of septic shock patients. rhAPC also protected animals and healthy volunteers from hypotension. low tidal volume mechanical ventilation and tight blood glucose control have improved survival in critically ill patients. aggressive insulin therapy improved 30-day survival in critically ill surgical patients and reduced morbidity indicators such as weaning from mechanical ventilation.
