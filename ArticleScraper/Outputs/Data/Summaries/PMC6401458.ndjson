{"summary": "MERS-CoV was originally isolated as a novel coronavirus from a fatal case of acute respiratory distress syndrome and renal failure in 2012. human receptor for the virus, called human CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4), was identified subsequently (2). animal models are needed to better understand the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV and facilitate development of effective vaccines and drugs. the control of CAG or cytokeratin 18 promoters (5\u20137) developed severe lung disease, along with infection of the brain. autopsy data are available from only one MERS patient; therefore, it is unclear whether MERS-CoV causes a systemic infection. adult Tg mice showed higher levels of proinflammatory cytokine- and chemokine-mediated macrophage infiltration of the lungs than young Tg mice. the data suggest that age affects the immunopathology of MERS-CoV infection in these Tg mice. CD3-positive lymphocytes from 2/15 tested pups were positive for hDPP4. these mice were then crossed with C57BL/6 mice to establish two independent Tg lines. the Tg animals were born at the expected Mendelian ratio and were outwardly indistinguishable from control littermates. Tg1 and Tg2, hDPP4+/ transgenic mouse lines 1 and 2; non-Tg, hDPP4/ mouse. human DPP4 exons 1 to 26 subjected to PCR using specific primers. on 8 565 GGTCAGCCTTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT exon 26 (1) and exon 26 (2) are primer sets for the first half and the second half of exon 26. we first performed Western blot analysis with a goat anti-CD26/hDPP4 polyclonal antibody (AF1180; R&D Systems) which detected hDPP4 but cross-reacted weakly with mouse DPP4. hDPP4 expression was undetectable in brain tissue by Western blot analysis. endothelial cells lining blood vessels and leptomeninges of the human brain were positive for hDPP4. hDPP4 expression was undetectable in brain tissue. expression of hDPP4 was higher in lymphocytes from Tg2 mice than in humans. expression of hDPP4 was higher in lymphocytes from Tg2 mice. expression of hDPP4 was higher in lymphocytes from Tg2 mice than in humans. C57BL/6, non-Tg, and Tg2 mice were sacrificed 24 h later. expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in saline- and poly(IC)-inoculated animals. hDPP4-Tg mice were used instead of non-Tg mice. dotted line denotes the detection limit of the assay. RNA was extracted from splenocytes isolated from splenocytes. RNA levels were normalized against -actin (endogenous control) Tg2 mice and C57BL/6 mice were inoculated intranasally with 105 TCID50 of MERS-CoV. tissue specimens (the maxilla, nasal wash fluid, lung, and lung wash fluid) were collected at 6 h p.i. and on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 p.i. virus isolation, detection of viral antigens by immunohistochemistry, and detection of the MERS-CoV genome by real-time PCR in tissues from Tg2 and non-Tg mice inoculated with MERS-CoV Animala. experimental infection of common marmosets with MERS-CoV resulted in viremia. animal studies have identified MERS-CoV RNA in the lymphoid organs of infected animals. but no infectious virus was detected in the spleen from Tg2 mice. Tg2 mice showed progressive pulmonary inflammation associated with acute virus infection. on day 1 p.i., there was no obvious infiltration of the lungs in Tg2 mice. however, mild cellular degeneration and viral antigen-positive cells were seen in the bronchioles and a few alveolar areas. progressive immunopathology occurred uniformly throughout the lungs but resolved within 14 days after infection. no inflammation or viral antigen expression in the brain through 35 days p.i. IHC staining of sequential sections revealed abundant MERS-CoV antigen-positive cells in affected areas (middle column, B, E, H, H, H, K, N, and Q) severe inflammation, with many mononuclear cells in the alveolar spaces and regenerated type II pneumocytes in the alveolar wall, was observed within 7 days p.i. the right panels show the brain cortex from samples from panels A, D, and G, respectively, with hematoxylin and eosin staining (B, E, and F) Neither lesions nor MERS-CoV antigen-positive cells were detected in the brain. age (>45 years) is considered to be one of the risk factors for MERS-CoV infection in humans. the viral titers in lung wash fluid from Tg2 mice were detectable up until 3 days p.i. the supernatants from lung tissue homogenates (20%) showed a high viral load from 1 to 5 days p.i. infectious virus was detectable up until 7 days p.i. the body weight of 25-week-old mice was monitored daily after intranasal inoculation with MERS-CoV (n = 6 Tg2 mice and n = 7 non-Tg mice). dotted line denotes the detection limit of the assay. nuclear cells and polynuclear cells were observed in the alveoli from 5 days p.i. lymphoid cell aggregates were seen around bronchioles and blood vessels on day 35 p.i. the predominant inflammatory infiltrate within the lungs of both 10-week-old and 25-week-old Tg mice comprised Iba-1-positive large cells and CD3-positive mononuclear cells. infiltrating cells were positive for Iba-1 (green) or CD3 (brown) high levels of macrophage inflammatory protein 1 (MIP-1) and monokine induced by IFN- (MIG) were detected in the lungs of both groups of Tg2 mice from days 3 or 5 to 7 p.i. expression of IP-10, IL-12, and IL-1 in 25-week-old Tg mice was higher than that in 10-week-old Tg2 mice. aging causes more severe immunopathology; young and adult Tg mice show different pathologies in the lung after MERS-CoV infection. a dotted line denotes the detection limit of the assay. we did not find any evidence of IFN-4 or IFN- in the lungs of 10-week-old Tg2 mice at early times postinfection. however, we observed a transient increase in IFN-4 and IFN- mRNA expression in the lungs of two out of four Tg2 mice. this level fell by 7 days p.i.. hDPP4 is a protease expressed on the surface of cells in various organs, including T cells (24, 25) the enzyme is expressed by approximately 60% of resting T cells isolated from blood (26). this antibody does no react with murine DPP4 to detect expression of hDPP4 in mice. the open and filled circles denote the centromere (Cen) and telomere (Tel) of human chromosome 2 respectively. the cloned region in the BAC construct is denoted by a black line. 1 130 AATGTTTAACTCGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG a goat anti-CD26/hDPP4 polyclonal antibody detected hDPP4 but cross-reacted weakly with mouse DPP4. all of the tissues from hDPP4 Tg mice expressed hDPP4 including liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, small intestine, large intestine, pancreas, brain, spinal cord, and skeletal muscle. Western blot analysis of homogenized human and mouse tissues stained with anti-hDPP4 polyclonal antibody. hDPP4 expression was undetectable in brain tissue by Western blot analysis. cells in the lungs, bile capillaries in the liver, the renal tubular epithelium, and the surface of epithelial cells in the small intestine were positive for hDPP4. most lymphocytes in the T cell zones of the spleen and lymph nodes from Tg2 mice were positive for hDPP4. hDPP4 expression in mice does not have a marked effect on basal innate immune responses in the three mouse strains. however, Tg2 mice show slightly stronger or earlier innate immune responses than C57BL/6 and non-Tg mice. in this animal model, we made comparisons between MERS-CoV-infected and non-Tg mice. Tg2 mice showed seroconversion at 35 days p.i., whereas C57BL/6 mice did not. body weight of 10-week-old mice was monitored daily after intranasal inoculation of MERS-CoV at a dose of 105 TCID50. RNA was extracted from splenocytes isolated from Tg2 and C57BL/6 mice. RNA levels were normalized against -actin (endogenous control) virus was undetectable in the respiratory tract at 7 days p.i. no infectious virus was detected in the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, intestines, and brain up to 7 days p.i. d Viral genome was detected in samples at 3 and 5 days p.i. viral replication and MERS-CoV RNA were detected in the brain of Tg2 mice. however, no MERS-CoV RNA was detected in the brain of Tg2 mice. lymphoid organs of Tg2 mice were as susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. lymphoid organs were not a major site of MERS-CoV replication. inflammatory changes in the lungs of hDPP4-Tg mice were examined histopathologically on days 1, 3, 5, 7, 14 and 35 p.i. at day 7 p.i., there was evidence of severe lung inflammation, including perivascular and alveolar septal thickening, caused by infiltrating mononuclear cells. focal cellular infiltration was still evident in the peribronchioles and alveolar septa although viral antigens and inflammatory responses had cleared from the lungs by day 35 p.i. lungs of human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (hDPP4)-transgenic mice inoculated with MERS-CoV were localized in the lungs. hematoxylin and eosin staining showed abundant antigen-positive cells in affected areas. hDPP4-positive bronchiolar epithelial cells were hDPP4-positive bronchiolar epithelial cells (upper panels) and alveolar epithelial cells (lower panels) hDPP4-transgenic mice infected with MERS-CoV showed significant weight loss from days 7 and 8 p.i. before recovering by day 14 p.i. 25-week-old Tg2 mice had seroconverted by 35 days p.i. whereas the C57BL/6 mice had not. viral replication kinetics and sites of viral replication in 25-week-old and non-Tg mice. supernatants from maxilla tissue homogenates from Tg2 mice contained 101.7 and 102.0 TCID50/g at 1 and 3 days p.i. 50/ml, 103.3 TCID50/ml, 102.3 TCID50/ml, and 104.9 TCID50/ml were slightly higher than those in 10-week-old Tg2 mice. the body weight of 25-week-old mice was monitored daily after intranasal inoculation with MERS-CoV. histopathological analysis revealed that 25-week-old Tg2 mice showed delayed and prolonged inflammatory responses in the lung compared with those in 10-week-old Tg2 mice. viral antigen-positive cells were seen in the alveolar area on day 1 p.i. and then in the bronchi on day 3 p.i., along with a sparse cellular infiltrate. cellular infiltration was observed in the alveoli from 5 days p.i. HE, hematoxylin and eosin staining were used in the upper panels. anti-MERS-CoV nucleocapsid protein polyclonal antibody was used. compared inflammation of alveoli in 10-week-old and 25-week-old Tg mice. cytokine and chemokine expression is observed in MERS-CoV-infected patients. measured levels of 20 cytokines and chemokines in lung samples. expression of gamma interferon (IFN-)-induced protein 10 (IP-10) in the lungs of both 10- and 25-week-old Tg2 mice. IP-10, IL-12, and IL-17 were detected only in 25-week-old Tg2 mice. IL-1, a potent proinflammatory cytokine associated with inflammation and fever, was detected from 3 days p.i. and peaked at 5 days p.i. before falling at 7 days p.i. we measured expression of mRNA encoding IFN-4 and IFN- (type I IFN with antiviral activity) in the lungs of 10- and 25-week-old mice at 6 h and at 1, 3, 5, and 7 days p.i.. no IFN- mRNA was detectable in lung samples from either group. hDPP4-Tg mouse shows a pattern of hDPP4 expression that closely mimics that in human tissues. this mouse model also shows susceptibility to infection by MERS-CoV. this mouse model also shows susceptibility to infection by MERS-CoV. Tg mouse model lacks clinical signs and mortality associated with severe MERS-CoV infection. we could not ignore the fact that virus levels in lungs were lower than those reported for other mice. hDPP4 protein in the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and brain, viral infection and replication were limited (mainly) to the lower respiratory tract. hDPP4 protein in the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, and brain, viral infection and replication were limited (mainly) to the lower respiratory tract, with little upper respiratory tract involvement. fatal case of human MERS-CoV infection published by Ng et al. showed no sign of MERS-CoV infection in the brain (43) no reports suggest that MERS-CoV shows tropism for brain tissue. primary target of MERS-CoV is the lower respiratory tract. mice expressed mRNA encoding the type I IFN, IFN-4, during the early phase of the MERS-CoV infection. both IL-1 and IL-17 are proinflammatory cytokines that attract monocytes and neutrophils; therefore, they may exacerbate immunopathology after infection. hDPP4-Tg mouse model shows mild respiratory infection by MERS-CoV. immunopathology seems to resemble a mild and early stage of infection in humans. animal model may provide new insight into disease pathogenesis. vero E6 cells were cultured in Eagle\u2019s MEM containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 50 IU/ml penicillin G, and 50 g/ml streptomycin (5% FBS-MEM) stocks of MERS-CoV were propagated and titrated on Vero E6 cells and cryopreserved at 80\u00b0C. one hundred TCID50 aliquots of MERS-CoV were incubated for 1 h in the presence of mouse serum (serially diluted 2-fold) and then added to confluent Vero E6 cell cultures in 96-well microtiter plates. lowest and highest serum dilutions tested were 1:2 and 1:512, respectively. blood was collected from the retro-orbital venous plexus using heparinized capillary tubes. samples were then treated with red blood cell lysis buffer. cells were resuspended in staining buffer (PBS containing 2.5% FBS, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.05% NaN3). tissues were homogenized in 0.5 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris/HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1% [vol/vol] Nonidet P40 [NP-40], 0.5% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) containing a protease inhibitor mixture (Complete Mini; Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) Tg2, non-Tg, and C57BL/6 mice (10 weeks old) were anesthetized and received 20 g of poly(IC) in 20 l of saline intranasally. the dose of poly(IC) was determined from previous studies. mice were sacrificed at 1 day postadministration. liver, spleen, lung, trachea, small intestine, colon, pancreas, cerebellum, and skeletal muscle were obtained from US Biomax, Inc. to obtain animal tissues, mice were anesthetized and perfused with 2 ml of 10% phosphate-buffered formalin. fixed tissues were routinely embedded in paraffin, sectioned, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. mRNAs encoding IFN-, IFN-, and the E gene of MERS-CoV were examined by real-time RT-PCR using an ABI Prism 7900HT Fast real-time PCR system. expression of each gene was normalized to that of -actin. hDPP4-expressing CD3+ T cells within the splenocyte population were detected by flow cytometry analysis. the percentage of CD3+ T cells within the splenocyte population was 39.11% 3.8%, and that of hDPP4-expressing CD3+ T cells was 26.46% 1.9%. replication was determined after 1 and 2 days of culture. RNA from splenocytes infected with MERS-CoV was extracted at 1 and 2 days p.i. and subjected to quantitative real-time RT-PCR (10). used in this study were obtained from US Biomax, Inc., GeneTex, Inc., Alpha Diagnostics International, or Protein Biotechnologies. the protocols were approved by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) or Institutional Review Board. titers of MERS-CoV neutralizing assay were determined in 96-well microtiter plates. blood was obtained from each mouse and allowed to clot. sera were then inactivated by incubation at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. gene was assessed by fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis. the mice were then backcrossed onto C57BL/6NCr for five generations. lymphocytes were isolated from blood taken from the tail vein. human tissue lysates prepared from the liver, spleen, kidney, heart, lung, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, pancreas, and brain were purchased from Alpha Diagnostics International (San Antonio, TX) tissues were homogenized in 0.5 ml of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer (RIPA) buffer. the bands were detected by an Immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and an LAS-3000 apparatus (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) the bands were detected by an immobilon Western Chemiluminescent HRP substrate (Millipore) and an LAS-3000 apparatus (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan). clinical signs were observed up until 14 days p.i. to analyze virus replication, hematological parameters, cytokine expression, and disease pathology. all mock-infected mice were inoculated with 2% FBS-MEM and used as controls for all analyses involving mice aged 9 to 10 weeks. we used a rabbit anti-human CD3 antibody (790-4341; Ventana Medical System, Inc., Tucson, AZ) and a rabbit anti-human Iba-1 antibody (019-19741; Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, AZ) to measure the levels of type I IFN mRNA expression and the number of viral genome copies. inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in mouse lung homogenates (10% wt/vol) were measured using a commercial mouse Cytokine 20-Plex antibody bead kit (thermo Fisher Scientific) the percentage of CD3+ T cells within the splenocyte population was 39.11% 3.8%. that of hDPP4-expressing CD3+ T cells was 26.46% 1.9%. the cells were resuspended in the medium and infected with MERS-CoV."}
