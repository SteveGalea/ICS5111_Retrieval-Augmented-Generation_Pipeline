{"summary": "a precise viral quantitation method was used to characterize the role of viral load in clinical outcomes and in viral co-infections. participants had nasal and throat specimens obtained and multiplex PCR testing with a commercial assay (FilmArray; bioMerieux). RV viral loads were seen with co-infections with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), metapneumovirus (MPV) and parainfluenza (PIV) but not with influenza, adenovirus or coronavirus."}
