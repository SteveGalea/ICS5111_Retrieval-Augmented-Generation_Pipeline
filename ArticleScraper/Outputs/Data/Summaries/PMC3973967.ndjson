{"summary": "cinnamon water extract has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity and modulate macrophage activation, a desirable trait for the management of obesity or atherosclerosis. results demonstrate that CWE was able to interfere with monocyte differentiation and macrophage scavenger activity, indicating its potential in preventing the development of atherosclerosis. macrophages express scavenger receptors that play an important role in host defense and tissue homeostasis. macrophages eradicate microbes, clear dying cells, remove cellular debris, and eliminate metabolite buildup in the extracellular matrix. scavenger receptors bind and internalize exogenous and endogenous damage-associated molecules. one hundred grams of cinnamon was pulverized and soaked in one liter of water for 48 h at room temperature. after filtration, resultant filtrate was evaporated and lyophilized. coniferyl aldehyde, coumarin, cinnamic acid, and cinnam aldehyde (Sigma, MO, USA), or at 280 nm for cinnamyl alcohol (Sigma), were tentatively identified with a spiked input of authentic standards. mice aged 8\u201310 weeks were purchased from the Korean branch of Taconic, SamTaco (Osan, Korea), and maintained with rodent chow and water cDNA preparation and real-time PCR THP-1 cells (2 106 cells) were cultured with PMA (100 nM) in the presence of 100 nM PMA for 48 h. cDNA preparation and real-time PCR THP-1 cells (2 106 cells) were plated in 96-well plates. PCR was performed in triplicate using a StepOne Real-time PCR system. after an initial heat denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, the PCR conditions were set for 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. Relative gene expression was determined using the standard curve method and normalized to actin. DH (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, CA, USA), mouse SRA (R&D Systems), extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) 1/2, or phospho-ERK1/2 ( Cell Signaling Technology, MA, USA) diluted in 5% skim milk in TBST overnight at 4\u00b0C. blots were washed with TBST and incubated for 1 h with anti-goat, mouse or rabbit horseradish peroxidase- one hundred grams of cinnamon was pulverized and soaked in one liter of water for 48 h at room temperature and further dissolved by sonication for 1 h. the resultant filtrate was evaporated and lyophilized. Mice Male Balb/c mice aged 8\u201310 weeks were purchased from the Korean branch of Taconic, SamTaco (Osan, Korea), and maintained with rodent chow and water ad libitum in a temperature and humidity controlled pathogen-free facility. the protocol was approved by the KyungHee University institutional committee for the care and use of laboratory animals. cDNA preparation and real-time PCR THP-1 cells (2 106 cells) were cultured with PMA (100 nM) in the presence of CWE for 48 h. total RNA was extracted using an RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Germany) Western blotting THP-1 cells (1 107 cells) were pretreated with CWE or U0126 (20 M) for 1 h prior to exposure to PMA for 30 min for ERK1/2 activity or for 72 h for SRA synthesis. mice macrophages (5 106 cells) were cultured with M-CSF (25 ng/ml) in the presence of CWE for 24 h. TBST cells were incubated for 1 h with anti-goat, mouse or rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated antibodies. Flow cytometry Cells were incubated with Alexa488-acetyl LDL. treatment with PMA causes these cells to stop mitosis, adhere to the culture plate, and differentiate into mature macrophages. the maximum concentration assayed here caused a 10% decrease in cell viability at the end of 72 h culture period. mouse peritoneal macrophages were cultured in the presence of fucoidan for 24 h. incubation of longer than 2 h did not increase the uptake of Alexa488-acetyl LDL. in our experimental setting, fucoidan inhibited the uptake of Alexa488-acetyl LDL by 80%. mouse peritoneal macrophages were cultured with CWE for 24 h. then incubated with Alexa488-acetyl LDL for 16 h. CWE suppressed Alexa488-acetyl LDL uptake in a concentration-dependent manner. peritoneal macrophages were cultured in the presence of CWE with (A) or without (B) M-CSF for 24 h, and whole protein was extracted. SRA protein was analyzed by Western blotting. in or ERK1/2 was used as endogenous control. we identified the known bioactive compounds of cinnamon, cinnamyl alcohol, cinnamic acid, cinnamaldehyde, coniferyl aldehyde, and coumarin. THP-1 cells were incubated with different concentrations of CWE in the presence of PMA for 48 h. total RNA was extracted and mRNA expression was analysed using real-time PCR. each gene was normalized with actin. cellular uptake of Alexa488-acetyl LDL was analyzed by flow cytometry. cells without Alexa488-acetyl LDL; B, cells with Alexa488-acetyl LDL; C, cells with Alexa488-acetyl LDL in presence of fucoidan. Alexa488-acLDL uptake was reduced by 40%, 45% and 55% at 10, 50 and 100 g/ml CWE, respectively. peritoneal macrophages were cultured in the presence of CWE with (A) or without (B) M-CSF. CWE at 100 g/ml almost abolished SRA protein synthesis. THP-1 cells were incubated with or without U0126 (20 M) or CWE for 72 h. CWE also inhibited PMA-stimulated ERK1/2 activation. CD11b is induced in PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells. scavenger receptors consist of eight classes; among them, SRA, belonging to class A, is expressed mostly in macrophages [12,27] the expression of SRA and CD36 can be differentially controlled. a similar effect was observed in peritoneal macrophages of which scavenger receptors had already occupied before CWE treatment. PMA, an analogue of diacylglycerol, activates protein kinase C (PKC) which is a key enzyme of cell differentiation. the increased expression of p21 is due to the generation of ROS and PKC-mediated ERK1/2 activation. authors declare that they have no conflict of interest. authors\u2019 contributions HK designed research, performed realtime PCR and wrote the paper."}
