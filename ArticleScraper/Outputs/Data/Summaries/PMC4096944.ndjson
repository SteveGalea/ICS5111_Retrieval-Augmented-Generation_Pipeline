{"summary": "a decade ago, characterizing a viral population by isolating individual variants to explore whole genome evolution at numerous time-points and growth conditions was a laborious and ambitious task. the lag between experimental and computational evolution is beginning to close. we have selected topics that reflect on each of these questions. RNA viruses have the highest mutation rates in nature. the longer the genome, the more likely detrimental mutations will accumulate to inactivate the virus. a length that, given the error rates of RNA dependent RNA polymerases, is expected to receive 1\u20132 mutations per nucleotide site per replication. in addition to fine-tuning replication fidelity and proofreading, RNA viruses could potentially evolve more or less robust genomes in response to the mutational burden and demands they encounter while replicating in their hosts [8] Elena describes how virus populations could evolve as clusters of genomes that localize within a broad neutral network. virology studies employ the word \u2018fitness\u2019 at some point, but the exact definition and implications are often ill-defined and imprecise. in essence, fitness means \u2018better than\u2019 and it is up to the author, although more often the reader, to figure out exactly to which property one is referring. authors raise the current challenges on how to define it, how to properly measure it and how to consolidate evidence from tissue culture and in vivo experiments in different hosts. a genotype that could be considered of high fitness in one tissue (fitness peak) may represent a lower fitness genotype in another tissue (plateau or valley in the new fitness landscape) a challenge to studying virus evolution and fitness in vivo lies in identifying to what extent fitness increases in the virus come at a cost, or in some cases a benefit, to the fitness of the host. for a virus evolving in permissive cell culture models where resources and infection conditions are kept constant, evolution may favor selection of the fastest (sometimes the most \u2018virulent\u2019) replicator. virologists often hunt for cell lines or hosts that are highly permissive for the replication of a certain virus in order to recover high viral titers. virologists often hunt for cell lines or hosts that are highly permissive for the replication of a certain virus in order to recover high viral titers. the topics covered in this issue, we believe, layout some of the groundwork that is needed to get us closer to the next horizon in virus evolution. the move from the descriptive, through the mechanistic, towards the predictive has been highlighted as of special interest."}
