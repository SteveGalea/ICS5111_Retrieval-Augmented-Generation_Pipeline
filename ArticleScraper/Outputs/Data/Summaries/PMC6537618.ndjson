{"summary": "SLEV is a mosquito-borne member of the genus Flavivirus, family Flaviviridae. it has the ability to cause neuroinvasive disease in humans. SLEV was the major cause of epidemic encephalitis by an arbovirus in the u.s. ribavirin triphosphate is the primary metabolite form of ribavirin. it enters the virus\u2019s host cell and acts as a nucleoside analogue. ribavirin triphosphate is a nucleoside analogue that is incorporated into viral genomes. mutagen-resistant populations develop through dynamic modulation of the RdRp (E416K) genetic, phenotypic and structural characterization of these variants provides additional evidence that mutagen-resistant populations develop through dynamic modulation of the RdRp. increased pretreatment time (1\u20134 h) was subsequently used in an attempt to select for greater resistance. decreased resistance was apparent in both populations for passages 7 and 8. inocula for passages 2\u20134 were taken following treatment with 250 M and passages 5\u20138 following treatment with 500 M ribavirin. the pretreatment period was increased from 1 to 4 h for passages 7 and 8. clone from 6B (clone 6) and 3 each of the most resistant populations, 8A and 8B (clones 2, 3 and 6 and clones 6, 9 and 10, respectively) despite the lack of significantly resistant clones identified in 6A, the clone from this population showed the lowest ribavirin susceptibility (clone 9) was included in downstream characterization in order to obtain representative viruses from all populations. two of the most resistant viruses, 6B-6 and 8B-9, were subjected to treatment with T-1106, a recently developed antiviral drug for treatment of RNA virus infections. both 6B-6 and 8B-9 viruses showed significantly reduced sensitivity to T-1106 after treatment with 100 M, as compared to the wild-type control. passage 6B parental population and five of the eight clones displayed a single shared mutation at nucleotide position 8916 of the genome (G8916A) no other nonsynonymous mutations were identified in the untreated, BHK-passaged populations, as compared to the SLEV-IC. observed NS5 amino acid substitutions in SLEV ribavirin-resistant variants. the NS5 mutation is located in motif G, or the pinky domain, of the RdRp, distant from the active site of the enzyme. this residue has physical proximity to the structurally conserved residues (410 and 411) of the pinky domain known to interact with the +1/+2 junction of the RNA template strand. residue 416 is likely to interact with residues of the template at the +3 or +4 upstream position. the MTase domain (cyan) and polymerase domain (blue) are shown in ribbon form looking into the active site. the catalytic GDD sequence (motif C) is in stick representation (magenta) growth kinetics of four clones (6B-6, 8B-6, 8B-9, 6A-9), including the most resistant clones, were assessed in mammalian (BHK and HeLa) and mosquito (CxT) cells. aPeak titre, P0.05, t-test as compared to the SLEV-IC. despite attenuation on CxT cells, all variants grew to similar titres to SLEV-IC. both populations sequenced contained numerous low-frequency variants (1 %) distributed throughout the 3 kb region, in both cell lines. however, more positions across the SLEV-IC genome displayed mutation frequencies above 1 % as compared to the 8B-9 virus (12 vs 3) treatment with 500 M at passages 1\u20133 resulted in titre reductions from 4 log10 p.f.u. ml1 after the first passage to 2.5 log10 p.f.u. ml1 after passage 3. infectious titre reduction decreased to just over 1 log10 p.f.u. ml1. s were infected with SLEV-IC and deemed lineages A and B throughout passaging. infectious titres were determined with and without ribavirin treatment. the response to 500 M ribavirin throughout the passage experiment is shown. ribavirin resistance screens of all 36 clones in BHK cells identified 12 individual populations with statistically reduced ribavirin susceptibility. clone from 6B (clone 6) and 3 each of the most resistant populations, 8A and 8B (clones 2, 3 and 6 and clones 6, 9 and 10, respectively) cells were pretreated and held with or without 100 M ribavirin, in triplicate, following infection at a m.o.i. of 0.01, and harvested 3 days p.i. ribavirin-resistant variants are likely to be higher-fidelity variants [18, 20, 29]. NS5 sequencing Sequencing was performed to identify point mutations with a putative role in mutagen susceptibility. a total of 30 mutations were identified in these variants, including 9 nonsynonymous mutations resulting in residue changes in both the MTase and RdRp domains of the NS5. mutation is located in motif G, or the pinky domain, of the RdRp, distant from the active site of the enzyme. mutation has physical proximity to the structurally conserved residues (410 and 411) of the pinky domain known to interact with the +1/+2 junction of the RNA template strand. structure of the NS5 protein with SLEV-E416K is shown in ribbon form. residue 416 is likely to interact with residues of the template at the +3 or +4 upstream position. growth kinetics of four clones were assessed in mammalian cells. in vitro growth kinetics of ribavirin-resistant SLEV clones in vertebrate and invertebrate cell lines. cells were inoculated in triplicate at a m.o.i. of 0.01 and harvested at 96 h p.i. mutation frequencies of an approximately 3 kb region of SLEV-IC and 8B-9 were evaluated by deep sequencing after a single passage in BHK and C6/36 cells. both populations sequenced contained numerous low-frequency variants distributed throughout the 3 kb region, in both cell lines. ribavirin-resistant populations acquired amino acid changes in the RdRp (E416K) that were not present in untreated populations. a single shared mutation in the RdRp (E416K) was identified in the consensus sequences of five of the eight individual populations analysed and one of the parental populations. the SLEV E416K mutation is located in the SLEV pinky domain and the high-fidelity mutations previously identified in WNV are located in the priming loop and thumb domain. the mutation is the only shared NS5 amino acid change among the resistant clones. however, four additional residues in the MTase region were identified. mutations identified here provide additional support for the role of the flavivirus MTase in mutagen resistance and mutation restriction. the mutations identified here provide additional support for the role of the flavivirus MTase and further demonstrate that accurate and comprehensive evaluation of RdRp function and fidelity requires consideration of interactions between replicase subunits. amplification, library preparation, sequencing and analysis were identical for all samples. the experimental methods for amplification, library preparation, sequencing and analysis were identical for all samples. it can be assumed that there was no error bias for any specific sample. comparison of overall variant frequencies is therefore an accurate reflection of relative differences in viral mutation frequencies. mutations that are independent of NS5 mutations, consistent with previous studies with SLEV demonstrating cell-specific adaptation in vitro. the loss of replicative fitness of multiple variants in mosquito cells could also be explained by phenotypic trade-offs resulting from adaptation to BHK cell culture. studies will help to elucidate the role and mechanism of flavivirus replication complex in viral fitness and adaptation. cells and viruses were grown in EMEM supplemented with 10 % (v/v) FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1.5 g l1 sodium bicarbonate, 100 U ml1 penicillin and 100 g ml1 streptomycin. virus was rescued in BHK cells using a two-plasmid reverse-genetics system. rescued virus amplified once on BHK cells was used as the starting stock virus in ribavirin selection and subsequent characterizations. inocula for passages 1\u20134 were from growth in 250 M ribavirin, followed by 500 M inocula for passages 5\u20138. the m.o.i. ranged from 0.001 to 0.1 with passages 1\u20134 and, as resistance developed, was consistently 0.01 with passages 5\u20138. supernatant (50 l) was taken from each well at 1, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h p.i. all samples were diluted 1 : 10 with EMEM + 20 % (v/v) FBS. samples were titrated by Vero cell plaque assay as previously described. PCR products were purified directly from PCRs using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit. multiple primers targeting sequence within each amplicon were used for bidirectional sequencing to create at least twofold overlapping coverage of the entire NS5 gene. sequences were compiled and edited using the seqMan module of the DNAStar software package. avirin for 1 h (passage 6 clones) or 4 h (passage 8 clones) at 37 \u00b0C with 5 % (v/v) CO2. after 72 h, 1 ml of supernatant was harvested from each well and frozen at 80 \u00b0C. sensitivity assays performed similar to ribavirin sensitivity assays. 12-well plates were pretreated for 1 h with maintenance media containing 0, 100, 200 and 500 M T-1106. inoculum was removed, cells were replaced with T-1106-containing media. supernatants were collected 72 h p.i. for infectious titre determination. data analysis was performed by the Wadsworth Center\u2019s Applied Genomics Technologies Core. read qualities were analysed in FastQC (Babraham Institute, Cambridge, UK) reads were trimmed to a maximum of 250 bp to reduce the number of low-quality base calls at the end of the reads. PCR read duplicates were removed using SAMtools rmdup [58] wild-type SLEV-IC was previously generated in the arbovirus laboratory using an infectious cDNA clone kindly provided by A. Brault. rescued virus amplified once on BHK cells was used as the starting stock virus in ribavirin selection and subsequent characterization. each passage experiment contained a fresh untreated, unpassaged SLEV-IC control. virus was inoculated at a m.o.i. of 0.1 into duplicate wells, each assigned as a separate lineage (A and B) 100 l of purified plaque sample was amplified once in BHK cells. the remaining sample was used for RNA purification and sequencing. a total of 24 samples were chosen for sequencing analysis. RNA was extracted using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit (Qiagen) the entire NS5 gene was amplified by RT-PCR in four overlapping fragments, each between 1.0 and 1.5 kb. PCRs were visualized by gel electrophoresis and gel purified using the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit (primer sequences upon request) a total of 36 clones were isolated and amplified once in BHK-21 cells. they were pretreated with maintenance media containing 0, 250 or 500 M ribavirin. after 72 h, 1 ml of supernatant was harvested from each well. samples with both a lower reduction in infectious titre and a P-value 0.05 were defined as having increased resistance to ribavirin. Variants 6B-6, 8B-6 and 8B-9 were also tested for ribavirin resistance in HeLa cells. cells were pretreated with 0 and 100 M ribavirin for 1 h. -structural protein 1 (NS1) and a portion of the non-structural protein 2 (NS2) were amplified by one-step RT-PCR using invitrogen\u2019s Superscript III One-Step RT-PCR System with Platinum Taq High Fidelity (Life Technologies) PCR amplicons were visualized by electrophoresis, gel purified using the MinElute Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen)"}
