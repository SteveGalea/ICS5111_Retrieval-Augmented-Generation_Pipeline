{"summary": "the limited effectiveness of conventional medication has prompted the use of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as alternative or adjunctive therapy for the management of bronchiolitis. CAM could be any form of treatment defined by the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health (NCCIH) the predefined primary outcome was length of hospital stay. six studies examining the effect of CAM on inpatients with bronchiolitis reported on the review\u2019s primary outcome of length of hospital stay. despite decades of research, effective pharmacotherapy for bronchiolitis is still lacking. a comprehensive electronic literature search was carried out in Medline, Embase, CINAHL, AMED, and CENTRAL from inception until June 30, 2016 by one investigator. the search strategy was constructed using keywords including \u201calternative medicine\u201d, \u201ccomplementary medicine\u201d, \u201cherbal medicine\u201d, \u201cchinese traditional\u201d, \u201casian traditional\u201d, \u201calternative therapy\u201d, \u201cherbal therapy\u201d, \u201ctraditional therapy\u201d, supplement*, antioxidant, vitamin, natural, homeopathy, kinesiology, kinesiology study selection and data extraction Two investigators (KPK and SWHL) independently screened the titles and abstracts. full texts of relevant articles were retrieved and reviewed independently to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. any disagreement was resolved through discussion. all included studies were summarized and tabulated. all included studies were summarized and tabulated. the results were presented narratively. study selection and data extraction Two investigators (KPK and SWHL) independently screened the titles and abstracts. full texts of relevant articles were retrieved and reviewed independently to determine eligibility for inclusion in the review. any disagreement was resolved through discussion. data were extracted to calculate relative risk (RR) for dichotomous outcomes or mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes. a probability of 0.05 was considered statistically significant. three studies were funded by university or government agencies [18, 28, 30], while the other eight had no sponsorship [17, 19\u201321, 29, 31\u201333].

p0.01), duration of bronchiolitis symptoms (MD: -49.00 hours, 95% CI: -53.25 to -44.75; p0.01) and duration of feeding problem. no significant difference was observed in the duration of hospitalization between the groups (20 (magnesium/salbutamol) vs. 24 (magnesium) vs. 24 hours (salbutamol); p>0.05). inhalation of magnesium and salbutamol combination resulted in lower clinical severity scores compared to those treated with salbutamol. the herbal composition and medicinal properties of the respective Chinese herbal medicine are described in S1 Table. the authors examined the use of Shuang Huang Lian injection and found a significant decrease in the length of hospital stay (MD: -1.78 days, 95% CI: -2.72 to -0.84; p0.01) and duration of pulmonary signs of bronchiolitis. the herbal formulation was found to shorten the duration of respiratory symptoms such as cough (MD: -2.30 days; 95% CI: -3.02 to -1.58; p0.01), fever (MD: -1.60 days; 95% CI: -3.02 to -1.58; p0.01), dyspnea (MD: -2.50 days, 95% CI: -3.02 to -1.98; p0.01), chest wall re N-acetylcysteine In a randomized trial (n = 100) by Naz and colleagues, N-acetylcysteine showed no significant benefit in length of hospital stay compared to salbutamol. oral zinc showed no benefit in managing clinical symptoms of bronchiolitis. of magnesium and salbutamol combination resulted in lower clinical severity scores compared to those treated with salbutamol (MD: -0.60, 95% CI: -1.18 to -0.02; p = 0.04) or magnesium alone (MD: -1.30, 95% CI: -1.18 to -0.66; p = 0.04) [21] Adverse events Five of the total eleven studies provided information on adverse events (AE) studies of Chinese herbal medicine, vitamin D, N-acetylcysteine, and magnesium showed some benefits with respect to clinical severity scores [17, 21, 28] [30], oxygen saturation [30, 33], and symptom resolution [29\u201331, 33]. a number of studies, especially those which examined herbal decoctions used \u201ccure rate\u201d or a global assessment as an outcome. the agency for healthcare research and quality recommends future studies to ascertain clinically relevant outcomes, particularly rates of hospitalization, costs of care, parental satisfaction with treatment, and development of longer-term respiratory problems. the findings in this review may be subject to publication bias which is often difficult to detect in systematic reviews with few studies. the non-existence of reliable assays added challenges in elucidating nutrient-related conditions, theories, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacokinetics of mineral supplements in bronchiolitis. a lack of adverse events reporting can be considered as reporting bias and as such could have underestimated the magnitude of a problem. a large proportion of the included studies did not report for the primary outcome of interest in this systematic review. this may be an indication of selective outcome reporting with potential risk of bias. the inclusion of only published articles in this review may overestimate the potential benefit of CAM interventions. current evidence from clinical studies is scarce and often not methodologically robust. current evidence from clinical studies is scarce and often not methodologically robust. current evidence from clinical studies is scarce and often not methodologically robust. study by Deng et al. also compared Chinese herbal medicine with third generation cephalosporins, aminophylline, oxygen, digitalis, or frusemide. however, we did not find any evidence of signs and diagnosis of bacterial infection in the article. a large proportion of the included studies did not report for primary outcome of interest in this systematic review. the attention to issues identified in this review, including randomization, blinding, sample size, and complete reporting of safety profiles. well-designed randomized controlled trials are considered as the gold standards for judging the benefits of an intervention. as interest in the potential benefit of CAM grows, it is becoming imperative for healthcare providers to monitor the progress of the clinical literature and to communicate these findings to patients.
