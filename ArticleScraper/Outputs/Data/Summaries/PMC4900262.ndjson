{"summary": "signaling in the brain affects the activity of the orexigenic agouti-related protein and anorexigenic proopiomelanocortin (POMC)5 neurons in the hypothalamus. mutations in the leptin gene (ob) or leptin receptor (db) result in severe obesity caused by food overconsumption and decreased energy expenditure. forced transgenic overexpression of CEACAM1 in liver protected mice against insulin resistance and hepatic fat accumulation and inflammation in response to high fat intake. this was mediated, at least in part, by limiting fatty acid synthesis and enhancing -oxidation in liver (12). however, forced expression of CEACAM1 in liver did not affect food intake on either a regular or a high fat diet (12). glucose and Insulin tolerance tests performed on awake mice fasted for 6\u20137 h. mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1.5 g/kg BW dextrose solution. blood glucose was measured from tail at each time point. 0.2 mm [1-14C]palmitate (0.5 Ci/ml) and 2 mm ATP in incubation buffer. reaction terminated with glacial acetic acid. trapped CO2 radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation. mice were perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin. phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was accomplished using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. sections were rinsed 10 times for 6 min each in PBS, pH 7.4, and then for 30 min in 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS to quench endogenous peroxidase activity. p-STAT3-positive cells in the arcuate, ventromedial, and dorsomedial nuclei of the medial hypothalamus (Bregma 1.70 mm) were counted using open CFU. the body weight of each animal and the weight of the food were assessed to acclimate mice to the conditions of the study. m thickness were prepared from 4% paraformaldehyde, fixed, and OCT-embedded POMC-GFP tissue blocks. sections were blocked with 10% serum and exposed overnight to a custom-made CEACAM1 monoclonal antibody (1:50) and GFP (1:1000) secondary antibodies were incubated subsequently for 1 h at room temperature. lyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) in each sample. real time PCR primer sequences from mouse genes F indicates forward. p 0.05 were considered statistically significant. glucose and Insulin tolerance tests performed on awake mice fasted for 6\u20137 h. mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 1.5 g/kg BW dextrose solution. blood glucose was measured from tail at each time point. 300 mm sucrose, 2 mm EDTA, incubated at 30 \u00b0C for 45 min. reaction terminated with glacial acetic acid. trapped CO2 radioactivity measured by liquid scintillation in Cyto CinT. mice were perfused transcardially with 0.9% saline followed by 10% neutral buffered formalin. phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) was accomplished using a rabbit polyclonal antiserum. tissue was incubated for 1 h in 3% normal donkey serum (PBT) 0.04% 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Sigma) and 0.01% hydrogen peroxide dissolved in PBS. sections mounted on slides, air-dried, dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol, cleared in xylene, and coverslipped with Permaslip.

Arrows point to neurons magnified in the inset (B\u2013D) or cells positive for GFP (F and H) hypothalamic neuronal populations may also express CEACAM1. this protein contributes to suppression of food intake. both CEACAM1 and CEACAM2 appear to be involved in the central regulation of food intake. deleting leptin receptors only from POMC neurons causes an increase in fat mass without significantly affecting food intake. signaling through leptin receptors in POMC neurons may regulate physical activity to a larger extent than food intake. decreased fatty acid -oxidation in the muscle of Cc1/ mice is likely to be regulated by a mechanism brought about by deleting Ceacam1 at an extra-muscular site. ing hypothalamic Ceacam1 may directly affect leptin response. it may also remove a potential reduction in hypothalamic FASN activity by CEACAM1 (9), leading to hyperphagia (20, 40) and reduced physical activity (21, 40). hyperinsulinemia may lead to enhanced phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-triphosphate signaling and hyperpolarization of POMC neurons. data, assembled figures, and wrote a first draft of the manuscript.
