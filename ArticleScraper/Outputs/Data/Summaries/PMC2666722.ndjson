{"summary": "study aimed to determine which preventive measures may have been effective in protecting HCWs from infection, and which were not effective. a retrospective study was performed among 758 'frontline' health care workers who cared for SARS patients at the second Affiliated Hospital and the third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. a total of 384 (22.1%) of 1739 suspected or confirmed SARS patients were hospital workers [7] in Hong Kong, a total of 384 (22.1%) of 1739 suspected or confirmed SARS patients were hospital workers. a similar situation arose in the second Affiliated Hospital and the third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University during the epidemic of SARS in 2003. a total of 112 HCWs working on the frontline were diagnosed suffering from \"SARS\" according to a case definition of SARS by the Ministry of Health, China. 90 of the participants were successfully interviewed, giving a response rate of 80.4% (90/112) data collection A standardized interview with a structured questionnaire was used to obtain the following information in mid-May 2003. a standardized interview with a structured questionnaire was used to obtain the following information in mid-May 2003, about 4 months after the initial SARS outbreak in Guangzhou. more details about the name, definition and value of these variables are listed in Table 1.
