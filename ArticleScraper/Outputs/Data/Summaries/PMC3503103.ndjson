{"summary": "human noroviruses (MNVs) are enteric viruses that share many molecular and biological properties with HuNoV. the short course of HuNoV disease (often only 2 to 3 days) suggests that innate immune responses play a key role in control of the virus. IFN-/ responses during noV infection are likely initiated by pattern recognition receptors melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR-3), since mice lacking MDA-5 or TLR-3 have elevated MNV replication compared to wild-type mice (46). despite the importance of noroviruses, no drug or vaccine is currently available to treat or prevent HuNoV infection. e lacking IRF-3 (IRF-3/) are more susceptible to lethal infection with encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and west Nile virus (WNV) but their systemic IFN- response upon virus infection remains relatively intact (17, 57) mice with targeted knockout (Ifnar1tm1Agt) or floxed allele (Ifnar1tm1Uka) of the IFNAR1 chain of the IFN-/ receptor (IF IFN-/R/, IRF3/ and IRF7/ mice were generously provided by Ulrich Kalinke (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany), Michel Aguet (Swiss Institute for Experimental Cancer Research, Lausanne, Switzerland) and Tadatsugu Taniguchi (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) all of these mice were fully back-crossed to the C57BL/6 background. suspension-adapted RAW 264.7 cells were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 g/ml penicillin and streptomycin (P/S), 2 mM l-glutamine, and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N9-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) after 2 to 4 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. primary bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were generated as described previously. nonadherent cells were harvested and replated in fresh culture medium. macrophages and dendritic cells were either untreated or treated with 100 U/ml of recombinant IFN-4. the amount of IFN-/ per ml of serum was calculated from a standard curve using IFN- (PBL InterferonSource) the inhibitory activity of nave serum was independent because it was acid labile but was resistant to treatment with heat (56\u00b0C) and the IFN-/R-blocking antibody MAR1-5A3 (61). Ifnar1tm1Uka (herein called IFN-/Rf/f), Ifnar1tm1Agt (herein called IFN-/Rf/f), IRF3/ and IRF7/ mice were generously provided by Ulrich Kalinke (Paul-Ehrlich-Institut, Langen, Germany), and Tadatsugu Taniguchi (University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan) all of these mice were fully back-crossed to the C57 suspension-adapted cells were plated in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 g/ml penicillin and streptomycin (P/S), 2 mM l-glutamine, and 10 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N9-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES) after 2 to 4 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2, the overlay medium was removed primary bone marrow-derived dendritic cells were incubated in culture medium for 7 days. nonadherent cells were harvested and replated in fresh culture medium. macrophages and dendritic cells were either untreated or treated with 100 U/ml of recombinant IFN-4 or recombinant IFN- 12 to 16 h before inoculation. serum samples were treated with citrate buffer (40 mM citric acid, 10 ml KCl, 135 mM NaCl [pH 3.0]) for 5 min and neutralized with medium containing 45 mM HEPES. the amount of IFN-/ per ml of serum was calculated from a standard curve using IFN- (PBL InterferonSource) all data were analyzed using Prism 5 software (Graph-Pad Software, San Diego, CA) Mean values were used to calculate fold change. RESULTS IFN-/ responses control MNV infection in vivo. three days after inoculation, we observed a significant increase in MNV replication in the livers (300,000-fold), spleen (200,000-fold), mesenteric lymph nodes (70,000-fold), ilea (2,000-fold) and lungs (70,000-fold) of IFN-/R/ mice compared to wild-type controls. lysozyme M- and CD11c-expressing cells restrict MNV replication in vivo. IFN-/ and IFN- responses restrict MNV replication in cells in vitro. three days after inoculation, we observed a significant increase in MNV replication in the livers. no lethality was observed in IFN-/Rf/f LysM-Cre or IFN-/Rf/f CD11c-Cre mice. these data demonstrate that IFN-/ responses in lysozyme M- and CD11c-expressing cells restrict MNV replication in vivo. they suggest further analysis of mechanisms of IFN-/-dependent resistance to noV should include examination of the role of macrophages and dendritic cells. IRF-3 and IRF-7 are key transcription factors that regulate IFN-/ responses following virus infection (26, 57) to assess their role in control of MNV infection in vivo, we examined acute MNV replication in mice lacking both IRF-3 and IRF-7 (IRF-3/ IRF-7/) compared to wild-type and IFN-/R/ mice. titers shown are from three independent experiments of at least three mice each. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.005. serum was harvested 3 dpi. we observed a significant increase in MNV replication in the ilea (4-fold) of IRF-3/ mice and in the lungs (3-fold) of IRF-7/ mice compared to wild-type controls. these data suggest that while IRF-3 and IRF-7 independently restrict MNV replication in vivo, IRF-7 is a greater participant in innate immune responses during MNV infection. elevated MNV titers were observed in IRF-3/ IRF-7/ mice. no lethality was observed in IRF-3/ IRF-7/ mice inoculated with 3 107 PFU of MNV. circulating IFN-/ was not detected in either wild-type or IRF-7/ mice. IRF-3 and IRF-7 restrict MNV replication in macrophages and dendritic cells. to assess the role of IRF-3 and IRF-7 in restricting MNV replication, we generated primary macrophages and dendritic cells from wild-type mice. we also observed similarly increased MNV replication in IRF-3/ IRF-7/ macrophages (19-fold) and dendritic cells (3-fold) compared to wild-type controls. titers from IFN-4 or IFN-treated wild-type, IRF-3/ IRF-7/, and IFN-/R/ macrophages were compared with those from untreated controls. titers from IFN-4 or IFN-treated wild-type, IRF-3/ IRF-7/, and IFN-/R/ macrophages were compared with those from untreated controls. induction of IFN-4 and IFN- mRNA levels at 12 hpi was normalized to 18S RNA levels and calculated using the CT method. Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired t test. IRF-3 and IRF-7 are dispensable for the antiviral activity mediated by IFN-4 or IFN- in macrophages and dendritic cells. to assess whether IRF-3 or IRF-7 is important for induction of IFN-/ in cells infected with MNV, we measured IFN-/ mRNA during MNV infection. responses control MNV infection in vivo. a combination of IFN-/ and IFN- responses mediate control of MNV infection in vivo (28, 31, 49) we examined the specific contribution of IFN-/ responses in preventing lethal MNV infection in vivo. 300,000-fold), spleen (200,000-fold), mesenteric lymph nodes (70,000-fold), ilea (2,000-fold) and lungs (70,000-fold) of IFN-/R/ mice compared to wild-type controls. data demonstrate that IFN-/ responses are critical for host restriction of MNV replication in multiple tissues. IFN-/ and IFN- responses restrict MNV replication in cells in vitro. we examined acute MNV replication in mice with floxed alleles of the IFNAR1 chain of the IFN-/R in cells expressing either lysozyme M (IFN-/Rf/f LysM-Cre cells; macrophages/neutrophils) or CD11c (IFN-aBRf/fxCD11c-Cre cells). IFN-/Rf/f responses in lysozyme M- and CD11c-expressing cells restrict MNV replication in vivo. these data demonstrate that IFN-/ responses in lysozyme M- and CD11c-expressing cells restrict MNV replication in vivo. further analysis of mechanisms of IFN-/-dependent resistance to noV should include examination of the role of macrophages and dendritic cells. IRF-3 and IRF-7 are key transcription factors that regulate IFN-/ responses following virus infection. three days after inoculation, we observed a significant increase in MNV replication in the livers (487-fold), spleens (14,000-fold), mesenteric lymph nodes (3,400-fold), ilea (20-fold) and lungs (14-fold) of IRF-7/ mice. titers were compared with those from wild-type controls. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.005. IRF-3 and IRF-7 independently restrict MNV replication in vivo. compared titers in IRF-3/, IRF-7/, and IRF-7/ mice. increased MNV replication in the livers (8-fold), spleens (36-fold) and mesenteric lymph nodes (2-fold) of IRF-7/ mice compared to IRF-3/ mice. no lethality was observed in IRF-3/ IRF-7/ mice inoculated with 3 107 PFU of MNV (n = 10) circulating IFN-/ was not detected in wild-type, IRF-3/ IRF-7/ and IFN-/R/ mice. circulating IFN-/ was not detected in either wild-type or IRF-3/ IRF-7/ mice despite the elevated MNV titers observed in wild-type mice. IRF-3 and IRF-7 restrict MNV replication in macrophages and dendritic cells. we generated primary macrophages and dendritic cells from wild-type, IFN-/R/, and IRF-3/ IRF-7/ mice. titers from IFN-4 or IFN-treated wild-type, IRF-3/ IRF-7/, and IFN-/R/ macrophages were compared with those from untreated controls. titers from untreated IRF-3/ IRF-7/ and IFN-/R/ mice were compared with those from wild-type controls. Statistical significance was determined using the unpaired t test. dendritic cells from WT and IRF-3/ IRF-7/ mice were mock inoculated or inoculated with MNV (MOI of 10) mRNA levels at 8 and 12 hpi were normalized to 18S RNA levels. to assess whether IRF-3 or IRF-7 is important for induction of IFN-/ in cells infected with MNV, we measured IFN-/ mRNA during MNV infection of wild-type and IRF-3/ IRF-7/ macrophages and dendritic cells. we observed a significant decrease in IFN-4 (850-fold) and IFN- (3,600-fold) mRNA induction in IRF-3/ IRF-7/ macrophages compared to previous studies using the MNV model system identified a requirement for MDA-5 in IFN-/ production during MNV infection in vitro, as well as a role for MDA-5 in restricting MNV infection both in vitro and in vivo. in this report, we demonstrate an important role for IFN-/ responses in control of MNV replication and pathogenesis in vivo. MNV infects mononuclear cells in the intestinal lamina and has a tropism for macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro. IFN-/ responses in CD8+ dendritic cells, which lack the IFN-/R (20), likely play a role in restricting MNV replication. plasmacytoid DC that constitutively express IRF-7 may regulate IFN-/ responses at distal sites during MNV infection. additional studies will be needed to elucidate the role of neutrophils, subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells, during noV infection. despite elevated MNV titers in all tissues examined, IRF-3/ IRF-7/ mice failed to succumb to lethal MNV infection. expression of the IFN-/R is more important for control of MNV infection than the combination of IRF-3 and IRF-7. these additional transcription factors are involved in IFN-/induction or IFN-/ antiviral effects during MNV infection in vivo. V infection with extraintestinal symptoms such as benign infantile seizures and encephalopathy suggests that HuNoV may accumulate in other tissues of infected patients. mechanisms that restrict HuNoV replication to the intestine or limit the replication of virus that is released into the lymphatic or somatic organ systems remain unknown. study suggests a key role for IFN-/ responses in controlling norovirus replication at extraintestinal sites. the idea is speculative, impaired IFN-/ production during HuNoV infection in a subset of individuals could result in disseminated HuNoV infection. nuclear cells in the intestinal lamina have a tropism for macrophages and dendritic cells in vitro. IFN-/ responses in CD8+ dendritic cells, which lack the IFN-/R (20), likely play a role in restricting MNV replication in vivo. replication in livers, spleens, and mesenteric lymph nodes may regulate IFN-/ responses at distal sites during MNV infection. additional studies will be needed to elucidate the role of neutrophils, and subsets of macrophages and dendritic cells, during noV infection. expression of the IFN-/R is more important for control of MNV infection than the combination of IRF-3 and IRF-7. a significant decrease in IFN-4 and IFN- mRNA induction during MNV infection was not observed in macrophages lacking IRF-1 compared to wild-type controls. the mechanisms that restrict HuNoV replication to the intestine or limit the replication of virus that is released into the lymphatic or somatic organ systems remain unknown. mice lacking B or T cells sustain high levels of disseminated MNV infection, including in the brain and lung (31, 49, 66) the idea is speculative, impaired IFN-/ production during HuNoV infection in a subset of individuals could result in disseminated HuNoV infection and more severe disease."}
