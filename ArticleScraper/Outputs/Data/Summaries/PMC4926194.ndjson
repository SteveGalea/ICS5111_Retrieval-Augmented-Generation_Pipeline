{"summary": "the family Bunyaviridae contains five genera, including the Orthobunyavirus, Phlebovirus, Nairovirus, and Hantavirus. the genus tospovirus contains plant-infecting viruses. the genus Phlebovirus comprises more than 70 accepted members that are grouped into ten species complexes. periodic outbreaks have been observed throughout the african continent. despite a full recovery after the so-called 'three-day' or 'Pappataci fever', the febrile illness provoked by SFSV can be incapacitating due to headaches, myalgia, and general malaise. dipteran-borne phleboviruses are generally found in eponymous phlebotomus sandflies. the specific vector species are thought to be predominantly responsible for the maintenance of the viruses by vertical (transovarial) transmission. concerns have been raised about the potential introduction of RVFV into new areas with both susceptible vectors and hosts. phleboviruses have spherical particles of approximately 100 nm diameter. they are enveloped by a host-derived lipid membrane with the two viral glycoproteins Gn and Gc decorating the surface of the virus particle. the tripartite genome consists of the large (L), medium (M), and small (S) segments. mRNA transcribed from the antigenomic S segment is regulated by an intergenic region (IGR) the genome segments further contain conserved complementary oligonucleotide sequences at their 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends. the genome segments further contain conserved complementary oligonucleotide sequences at their 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends. central features of transmission from vector to host and entry of bunyaviruses have recently been reviewed elsewhere. incoming RNPs then serve as templates for primary transcription. phleboviral transcripts thus contain a 5\u2032-cap and a short stretch of a heterogenous, host-derived sequence, but no poly(A) tail. sandfly-borne phleboviruses encode an NSm protein which may have a role in the regulation of apoptosis. the NSs protein is remarkable in its low conservation across the Phlebovirus genus compared to other viral proteins. the NSs protein is an important virulence determinant. -associated protein 5 (MDA5) react to infection by distinct sets of RNA viruses. the prototypical RIG-I possesses two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), a central helicase domain and a C-terminal domain. the latter then engage in a homotypic CARD-CARD interaction with the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) recognizes viral dsRNA and poly(I:C) and signals via the adaptor toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TRIF) to activate IRF3, NF-B, and AP-1. recognition of single-stranded RNA by TLR7/8 and subsequent signaling via the adaptor myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 (MyD88) results in the secretion of IFN-, particularly by plasmacytoid den transmembrane (IFITM) proteins interfere with fusion of the viral envelope at the plasma membrane (IFITM1) or in the endosomal pathway (IFITM2, 3) and thus release viral RNPs into the cytoplasm of infected cells. the family of dynamin-like Mx GTPases are capable of restricting a wide range of viruses, presumably via trapping and missorting of incoming viral RNPs. phleboviruses do not produce substantial amounts of dsRNA during infection. in vivo, the cytoplasmic RNA helicase/MAVS axis was demonstrated to be the primary IFN induction pathway for RVFV [91] the in vivo role of TLRs, by contrast, is less clear. studies in a range of animal models suggested a protective effect of type I IFN in phleboviral infection. treatment with synthetic type I IFN inducers, such as poly(I:C) or polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid, poly-l-lysine and carboxymethylcellulose (poly(ICLC)) in a prophylactic or therapeutic regimen was reported to protect mice and hamsters from lethal RVFV infection PKR is activated during phleboviral infection and can act as potent restriction factor. IFIT proteins (mostly IFIT1 and IFIT2), long isoform of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 12 (PARP12L), 2'-5' oligoadenylate synthetase-like 2 (OASL2) and ISG15 influence the replication of RVFV. phleboviruses are sensitive to IFN and an early induction of type I IFN seems to be a determinant of disease outcome in animal models. phleboviruses carry at least three RIG-I-activating moieties (5\u2032ppp-dsRNA panhandle) per virus particle. phleboviruses carry at least three ppp-dsRNA panhandle per virus particle. NSs acts in the nucleus, where it blocks both the transcription and the export of host mRNAs. toscana virus (TOSV) NSs localizes to the cytoplasm, where it interacts with and induces proteasomal degradation of RIG-I. the NSs protein of RVFV was the first to be identified as an IFN antagonist. phleboviruses replicate exclusively in the cytoplasm, but NSs confers an anti-IFN activity. Clone 13 NSs is localized in the nucleus, forming characteristic filaments. the NSs of the RVFV wild-type strain ZH548 were then shown to almost completely block IFN- promoter activation in response to poly(I:C), while Clone 13 NSs had no inhibitory effect. NSs trigger rapid proteasomal degradation of the TFIIH subunit p62 early in infection. RVFV NSs recruits the F-box proteins FBXW11 and FBXW1 as specific adaptors to mediate PKR degradation. this degron motif overlaps with the aforementioned XaV motif (FVEV) necessary for TFIIH-p62 degradation. the NSs of RVFV Adames have also been found to inhibit host transcription. however, the latter does not affect the levels of PKR [131,132]. a further difference between RVFV and PTV NSs is that the latter does not affect the levels of PKR. the NSs protein of the intermediately-pathogenic sandfly-borne SFSV possesses the capacity for inhibiting type I IFN induction [93,131,132] the levels of PKR, however, are not affected [93,131,132] the inclusion bodies appeared to co-localize with lipid droplets and their formation associated with fatty acid synthesis. despite the open questions regarding biochemical composition and compartmental identity of the SFTSV NSs, it has become clear that they represent a site of sequestration and spatial isolation of multiple components of the RIG-I signaling pathway. antigenomic RNA segments are packaged into virions in dipteran-borne RVFV and tick-borne UUKV. NSs proteins are directly produced during primary transcription, despite being encoded on the antigenomic RNA. phleboviruses are emerging arboviruses, causing human diseases. rMP12 and rZH548 rescue systems were also established for phleboviruses. it remains to future studies to further expand and specify molecular characterization of NSs proteins of familiar and newly-emerging phleboviruses."}
