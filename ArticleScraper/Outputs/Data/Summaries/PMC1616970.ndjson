{"summary": "helicases are enzymes that separate in an energy-dependent manner stretches of duplexed DNA and/or RNA into single-stranded components. superfamily 1 and 2 contain helicases which share seven or more recognized signature amino acid motifs while SF3 and F4 and F5 helicases are characterized generally by three conserved motifs. eIF4a and Ded1 serve for translation of mRNAs while eIF4a and Ded1 serve for translation of mRNAs. other DEAD helicases act in ribosome biogenesis through regulation of small nucleolar RNAs and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) interactions. the strongest biological evidence supporting the importance of a helicase in the virus life cycle comes from those viruses with an RNA genome. all positive-strand RNA viruses encode one or more helicase/helicase-like open reading frame (ORF) which, aside from the RNA-dependant RNA polymerase, is the most highly conserved viral sequence. HIV-1 is a retrovirus of the lentivirus genus with an RNA genome of 9 kilobases which encodes nine polypeptides. the major HIV-1 structural proteins are encoded by three genes, gag (group-specific antigen), pol (polymerase) and env (envelope), while the accessory proteins, Vif, Vpu, Vpr and Nef, and the regulatory proteins, Tat and Rev, are the primary translation products of multiply-splic daniel sturridge: if RHA was knocked down, HIV-1 particles produced from these cells were significantly less infectious. sturridge: it is conceivable that RHA participates in the formation of infectious virus particles either by shaping Gag\u2013RNA interaction during viral particle assembly or by budding. he says the p68 DEAD-box helicase was shown to be a novel transcriptional co-activator for p53's transcriptional function (38). p68 is apparently required for their attributed transcriptional roles. RNA helicases may also serve co-factor function for transcription from the viral long terminal repeat. p68 is apparently required for their attributed transcriptional roles. a large body of work has suggested an elegant solution to this conundrum. it was established that the HIV-1 encoded Rev protein binds a highly secondary structured element (Rev responsive element; RRE) present in all unspliced and partially spliced HIV transcripts. new evidence suggests that RNA helicases are also co-factors for Rev-directed export of HIV-1 mRNAs (58). DDX1 binds directly to the N-terminus of Rev and to the RRE-RNA motif. reduced expression of DDX1 in astrocytes explains previously observed tissue restricted function of HIV-1 Rev. mRNAs encoding for viral Tat, Rev and Nef have been shown to exit the nucleus using the cellular mRNA export pathway. es of cellular RNA helicases for viral mRNA splicing remains to be clarified. how cellular RNA helicases might contribute to the translation of viral mRNAs also require further investigation. RHA has been found to be a part of the HIV-1 virion. a priori exclusion of cellular helicase as an antiviral target is not warranted. a priori exclusion of cellular helicase as an antiviral target is not warranted. a priori exclusion of cellular helicase as an antiviral target is not warranted. the NS3 protein, a RNA helicase encoded by Hepatitis C virus and related west Nile virus and Japanese Encephalitis virus can be targeted to inhibit viral replication. a synthetic immunomodulator Murabutide was shown recently to suppress HIV-1 replication in macrophages and T cells. we are in the preliminary stages of screening ring-expanded nucleoside analogs found previously to be successful NTPase/helicase inhibitors of west Nile virus, Hepatitis C virus and Japanese encephalitis virus. we have observed that a few of these candidate inhibitors have substantial anti-HIV-1 activity at doses that do not incur cytotoxicity to cells treated in tissue culture for 1 week. the ribonuclease\u2013helicase protein DICER requires TRBP to process duplex-structured miRNAs in order that the cell can use such matured miRNAs for antiviral defense. HIV-1 has developed mechanisms to co-opt the active functions of a virus-propitious cellular helicase (i.e. DDX3) but also to inactivate the role of a second virus-pernicious helicase (i.e. DICER) for retinoic acid inducible gene-1) (93) and Mda5 (melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5) (94) have been identified as suppressors of viral replication by binding to virus associated dsRNA. over-expression of RIG-1 and Mda5 was found to enhance dsRNA induced type I interferon antiviral response."}
