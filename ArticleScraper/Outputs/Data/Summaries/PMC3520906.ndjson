{"summary": "KCNQ (or Kv7) channels mediate sub-threshold, noninactivating voltage-gated potassium currents that have important roles in controlling membrane excitability [1] of the five known isoforms, KCNQ1\u20135 is the only one predominantly expressed in heart. two known examples include R-L3 and zinc pyrithione (ZnPy) to date, only three small molecule activators for the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex have been identified. they are mefenamic acid (MFA), DIDS and phenylboronic acid (PBA) these compounds strongly potentiate the KCNQ1 but exhibit little effect on homomeric KCNQ1. cells were transfected with Lipofectamine 2000TM reagent (Invitrogen) to express the channels and mutants. cDNA was cotransfected to identify the transfected cells by fluorescence microscopy. cDNA and mutagenesis were gifts from Drs. T. Jentsch. compounds to be tested were prepared using assay buffer. controls were assay buffer (EC0), EC50 of Retigabine and EC100 of ztz240.

Isolation of cardiomyocytes, IKs and action potential recording All animal procedures were performed in accordance with the National Institute of Heath Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. the IACUC checked all protocols and approved this study. gSO4 1, EGTA 5, HEPES 5 (pH = 7.2 with KOH) action potential was recorded at 35\u201337\u00b0C. a 10-ms depolarizing pulse was applied at a frequency of 0.16 Hz. a fixed 10 mV depolarization was used for all tested channels. HCP significantly potentiates both KCNQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex. I: the amplitude of outward current in the presence of the compound. to calculate I/I 0, the depolarization is +50 mV for KCNQ1/KCNE1 and is 10 mV for all other subtypes. the V 1/2 value was 19.431.39 mV with a left-shifting around 30 mV. inhibition of inactivation by activators is thought to be a contributing factor for an overall increase of current amplitude. togram summarized the effects of 10 M HCP on inactivation and deactivation of KCNQ1. the effects of KCNE1 on KCNQ1 include increase in overall current amplitude, slowing the activation and deactivation kinetics, and removal of inactivation. the effects of HCP on action potential were further examined. the action potential duration was elicited on isolated guinea pig cardiomyocytes. the effects of 1 M HCP on APD were reduced to 5.431.54% (n = 4) the change of APD, APD90 and APD50 was reduced to 5.431.54% (n = 4) the common phenotype of these mutants is reduction of IKs current. they are commonly thought to be mediated by the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex [2], [3], as a result of decrease in either channel activity or trafficking efficiency. traces of homomeric R243C and R539W with and without 10 M HCP. B. Representative traces of R243C/KCNE1 and R539W/KCNE1 with and without 10 M HCP. a fixed 10 mV depolarization was used for all tested channels. HCP significantly potentiates both KCNQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex. 68.779.62* 5 I/I 0 indicates the compounds\u2019 effects on amplitude of outward current of KCNQ channels. to calculate I/I 0, the depolarization is +50 mV for KCNQ1/KCNE1 and is 10 mV for all other subtypes. inactivation is a distinctive feature for KCNQ1. inhibition of inactivation by activators, such as ZnPy, is thought to be contributing factor for overall increase of current amplitude. the effects of KCNE1 on KCNQ1 include increase in overall current amplitude, slowing the activation and deactivation kinetics, and removal of inactivation. we tested HCP effects at 10 mV, which is the same potential to elicit the KCNQ1 channel. I/I 0, I, and I 0 are same as being referred in Table 1. HCP decreases the action potential duration because HCP potentiates the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex. the effects of 1 M HCP on APD were reduced to 5.431.54% (n = 4). the change of APD, APD90 and APD50 were 31.717.3, 34.118.09 and 37.657.36, respectively (n = 9). in our system, 1 M and 3 M R-L3 significantly deceased the APD50 about 9.591.29% (n = 3) and 25.302.29% (n = 3). mutants have exhibited potent effects on both the homomeric KCNQ1 and the KCNQ1/KCNE1 complex [2], [3], as a result of decrease in either channel activity or trafficking efficiency. mutants, R190Q, T587M, R243C and R539W, are located in different regions of KCNQ1. traces of homomeric R243C/KCNE1 and R539W/KCNE1 with and without 10 M HCP. Table 2. Effects of HCP on the mutants. HCP exhibited unique subtype selectivity. the potentiation on outward current for homomeric KCNQ channels at 10 mV is: Q1Q2Q4. residues critical for potentiation effects by KCNE1 are clustered together in the S6 region in proximity with the critical residues for ZnPy [13] phenotypes of the three activators easily differentiate HCP from them. mefenamic acid and DIDS effects on the homomeric KCNQ1 are much weaker than HCP. 1 M HCP effectively potentiated native IKs and left-shifted the G-V curve. the effects of HCP on shortening the action potential duration in cardiomyocytes further supports its potential use for development therapeutics for LQTs. the effects of HCP on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 mutant channels are weaker than that on wild type KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. the effects of HCP on the mutant channels are weaker than that on wild type KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. ztz240, another KCNQ activator that is distinct from retigabine and ZnPy, potentiates KCNQ2 and KCNQ4 but does not affect KCNQ1 and KCNQ3. the unique subtype selectivity supports HCP may potentiate KCNQ channels through a different mechanism from known activators. mefenamic acid and DIDS effects on the homomeric KCNQ1 complex are much weaker than HCP. they left-shift the G-V curve and slow deactivation but do not increase overall conductance of homomeric KCNQ1. most of the LQT-causing mutations were from KCNQ1 among the identified LQT-associated genes including KCNQ1, HERG,SCN5A, KCNE1 and KCNE2 [4], [5], [19]. these mutations cause reduction in the potassium current, thereby leading to prolongation of cardiac repolarization [7], [28], [29]. the effects of HCP on the KCNQ1/KCNE1 mutant channels are weaker than that on wild type KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel. in contrast, the left shifting for KCNQ1(R539W)/KCNE1 is only 29.352.74 mV. in the wild type KCNQ1/KCNE1 channel, the shifting was negligible."}
