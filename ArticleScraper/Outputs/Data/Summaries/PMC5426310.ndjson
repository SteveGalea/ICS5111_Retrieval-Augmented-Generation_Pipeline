{"summary": "in 2014 most experts considered Ebola a disease of remote forested regions of equatorial Africa. it was only when the virus entered a nosocomial setting with low standards of hygiene and sanitation that it became a source of epidemic amplification. the framing of Ebola as a 'hot virus' owes much to the work of new yorker journalist. the simultaneous outbreaks that occurred in 1976 at a Catholic mission in Yambuku in the DRC and Sudan. the Reston ebolavirus spread rapidly between primates kept in different rooms in the quarantine facility in Reston, Virginia, just across the Potomac from Washington DC. the outbreak resulted in four subclinical infections in laboratory workers, but concerns that Ebola might be a viable aerosol were overblown. the authors of the report took pains to challenge the assumption that such emergence events were always or largely due to spontaneous mutations in animal viruses and their adaptation to new hosts. 27 All three of these would prove highly relevant to the emergence of Ebola in West Africa in 2013\u201316. a key moment came in 1994 when the WHO established the Division of Emerging and Other Communicable Diseases Surveillance to improve surveillance of EIDs. this was followed, six years later, by the establishment of the WHO\u2019s global Outbreak and Response Network (GOARN) in two dozen outbreaks of Ebola prior to 2014, the virus had been responsible for just 2200 infections and 1500 deaths. 39 compared to AIDS, or more widely prevalent tropical diseases such as malaria, this made Ebola more of a nuisance than an urgent public health threat. GOARN does not appear to have functioned in the way it was intended. in the case of an Ebola, GOARN does not appear to have functioned in the way it was intended. in previous outbreaks the WHO dispatched an average of just two to five experts to the foci of Ebola epidemics. it is unfair to blame the WHO for not mobilizing a more comprehensive technical response in 2014. by the conclusion of the epidemic the WHO had deployed 1000 experts to west africa. lakoff suggests experts approached the west africa outbreak with \u2018relative confidence\u2019. he suggests that experts approached the outbreak with \u2018relative confidence\u2019. the revised regulations encouraged states to become active managers. biosecurity regimes seek to regulate the flow of \u2018good\u2019 things across territorial boundaries, while simultaneously limiting the flow of potential security threats (pathogens, terrorists, economic migrants) underpinning these biosecurity regimes are both active and passive forms of surveillance, with the latter acting as a check or failsafe on the former. these regimes are far from perfect, however. infectious disease outbreaks other than polio were the remit of Keiji Fukuda. these procedures were laid out in an annex to the IHR (2005). they included a \u2018decision instrument\u2019 with a flow chart for deciding when an event might require the declaration of a pheic. polio is a highly eradicable disease, unlike Ebola. mutations in vaccinated individuals can lead to the emergence of new vaccine-derived strains of the disease these can be neutralised by immunisation with killed polio vaccines. no such programmatic goals or bureaucratic interests were threatened by the sudden emergence of EBOV in Guinea-foresti\u00e8re. despite repeated calls for a network of reporting laboratories in Africa equipped with emergency diagnostic tests for Ebola and other EHFs, such calls had been heeded. a medic and global health specialist from King\u2019s College London arrived in freetown a year earlier to establish a partnership with the Connaught Hospital. he invited WHO officials and representatives of MSF, the Red Cross, GOAL and UNICEF to participate. by late April, as the initial surge in cases in Guinea began to slow, officials became even more complacent. official counts based on people presenting at treatment units with either confirmed or probable Ebola dipped in the middle of April to a new low. even in May the number of new cases recorded in Guinea each week never exceeded 50. liberia saw similar declines and by the end of May had reported no new cases since 9 April. 64 Graboyes makes a similar point when she argues that \u2018public ignorance\u2019 models of rumours fail to take account of africans\u2019 different understandings of risk and \u2018of what constitutes the medical research encounter\u2019. she argues that \u2018public ignorance\u2019 models of rumours fail to take account of \u2018the history of interactions with colonial government in the realm of health and disease\u2019 and \u2018of what constitutes the medical research encounter\u2019. the arrival of foreign medical teams in Guinea-foresti\u00e8re sparked violent clashes, especially in and around MSF installations in Macenta. similar resistance was encountered by Red Cross teams in other parts of the country. 67 Similar resistance was encountered by Red Cross teams in other parts of the country. the problem is, in order to have survivors, you need patients. in order to get patients, you need survivors. Sprecher labelled this dip in cases observed in Conakry in April \u2018the dog that didn\u2019t bark\u2019. the virus had most likely crossed into liberia and Sierra Leone in late April or early may from where it spread via several concurrent transmission lines. the first person in whom the infection was recognised in Sierra Leone was a pregnant woman who had presented with a high fever at Kenema General Hospital on 24 May. there was a delay of at least four weeks between Ebola entering Sierra Leone and recognition of the first cases. one or both of these Sierra Leone lineage viruses were subsequently reintroduced to Guinea, reigniting the epidemic there just as the original virus was dying out. one factor that stands out in view of the gaps identified ten years earlier was the absence of laboratory diagnostics. 83 this sense of siege was exacerbated by the government\u2019s decision to refer all suspected Ebola cases from Freetown to Kenema. rumours began spreading that the epidemic was a plot by the ruling All People\u2019s Congress party. villagers resisted his entreaties to evacuate suspect cases to Kenema for testing. 11 nurses lost their lives when Ebola ripped through wards in July\u2013August 2014. the outbreak also claimed the life of the chief physician and Lassa specialist. local physicians\u2019 unfamiliarity with Ebola and lack of understanding of the disease\u2019s diverse symptomatology. 88 By May the CDC had contact tracing teams in place in Foya. by June both it and the WHO were confident that liberia was free of Ebola. retrospective phylogenetic analysis suggests there were at least three related strains of the virus circulating simultaneously in west africa. the AP emails suggest that WHO officials were reluctant to treat the epidemic as anything more than a regional health crisis. the event that arguably changed this was the arrival of a visibly ill liberian-American lawyer named Patrick Sawyer at the airport on 20 July. the episode is instructive not only because of the way it focused attention on the wider security threat posed by the outbreak. yer collapsed and was rushed to the First Consultant Hospital, dying five days later. it was only thanks to strict hygiene controls and rigorous contact tracing that a wider outbreak was averted. it was exactly the sort of scenario that had been envisaged by the IoM report in the early 1990s when it warned about the dangers of the growth in international travel and commerce. it was only the second time in history that an infectious disease outbreak had been debated on the floor of the UN. in mid-September president Obama pledged to send 3000 troops to liberia. by the end of the year the US Congress had agreed emergency funding of $5.4 billion for Ebola. 102 Harvard\u2019s Global Health Institute and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine (LHSTM) were similarly critical of senior officials in Geneva. but the slow response reflected a lack of clarity about a range of governance issues across the WHO, as well as the roles and responsibilities of member countries. relegation of Ebola to the fringes of global health security is nowhere better illustrated than by the position it occupied in the decision instrument for pheics in the IHR (2005). the decision instrument for pheics aimed to introduce transparency into the deliberations of expert advisors, thereby avoiding accusations of conflicts of interest. research into promising investigational Ebola products had ceased to be a priority. but officials, like other experts, had little reason to believe that Ebola posed a wider epidemic threat to the region. in the past the rapid isolation of infectious patients and the speedy burial of victims had greatly foreshortened transmission chains. even when GOARN had been activated the outbreak was quickly brought under control. social resistance was further aggravated by bans on traditional burials. failure to adopt community engagement methods proved so effective in winning trust of rural populations during Ebola outbreaks in other parts of africa. net result was to depress true level of Ebola infections in Guinea."}
