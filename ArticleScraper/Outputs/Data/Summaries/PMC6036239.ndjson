{"summary": "viral quasispecies are defined as distributions of nonidentical but related genomes subjected to a continuous process of genetic variation, competition, selection and genetic drift. their high genetic diversity in host populations is partly explained by the low replication fidelity of viral RNA-dependent DNA (RdDp) or RNA polymerases (RdRp), which lack proofreading activity. high mutation frequencies of approximately 104 mutations per nucleotide as well as substitution rates similar or even higher than those observed observed genetic diversity within mutant spectra at a given time during viral evolution is the result of natural selection, genetic drift and migration over the continuous generation of viral variants. the heterogeneous composition of the mutant ensemble enables viral emergence and pathogenesis. the genetic diversity observed in several RNA plant virus quasispecies appears host dependent. this diversity might influence viral adaptability to new hosts. it remains to be determined to what extent hosts can play similar role in shaping quasispecies genetic variability in ssDNA plant viruses. most TYLCD-associated viruses have a monopartite genome with coding regions present in both virion (V) and complementary (C) sense strands separated by an intergenic non-coding region (IR) TYLCD epidemics have occurred in the Mediterranean Basin since the late 1980s (Czosnek, 2007; Navas-Castillo et al., 2011). TYLCMaV can infect common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and the wild host Solanum nigrum. TYLCSV cannot infect common bean (Monci et al., 2002) and the accumulation of TYLCV is strongly impaired in S. nigrum. TYLCMaV increased at 45 dpi, which may be related to their fitness decrease in this host. our findings highlight the great complexity and heterogeneity of begomovirus mutant spectra. this is particularly relevant for the wild reservoir, which hosts highly diverse begomovirus population. TYLCMaV is the result of a genetic exchange between TYLCV-Mld and TYLCSV-ES. the 3\u2032 half of the IR and the virus sense V2 and the CP ORFs derive from TYLCSV. the remainder 5\u2032 half of the IR and the Rep, C4, TrAP and most of REn ORFs derive from TYLCV. genin-labeled probes specific to TYLCV and TYLCSV recognize TYLCMaV. time-course infections of tomato yellow leaf curl, tomato yellow leaf curl and tomato yellow leaf curl Malaga virus clones in susceptible tomato, resistant tomato, common bean and the wild reservoir. extracts were centrifuged at 37\u00b0C for 2 min at room temperature for 5 min. aqueous phase was transferred to a new tube and mixed with 1 volume of isopropanol. nucleic acids were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000 g.

Virus quasispecies genetic complexity was also assessed by analyzing the average genetic distance (d), defined as to the average number of mutations per site. the structure-genetic (SG) matrix of Feng et al. (1984) was used to obtain the acceptability values of amino acid changes found in each genomic coding region. the values range from 0 (drastic amino acid changes) to 6 (synonymous replacements) and take into account structural similarities and probabilities of amino acid changes. pg of begomovirus ssDNA per 100 ng of total plant DNA is estimated from the qPCR determination of the accumulated viral load in the apical part of each plant being monitored during the 15 days that have elapsed between each collection time (15, 30, and 45 dpi) qPCR was performed on total DNA extracts previously analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis and UV-spectrophotometry. standard curves were prepared using pBluescript II SK (+) containing full-length viral genomes. pBluescript II SK contains 102 to 109 viral genome copies per l. TYLCMaV is the result of a genetic exchange between TYLCV-Mld and TYLCSV-ES. recombinant genome sequences share 99% nucleotide identity with parental virus sequences. TYLCMaV is the result of a genetic exchange between TYLCV-Mld and TYLCSV-ES. systemic virus infection of agroinoculated plants was confirmed on young non-inoculated leaves by tissue-print hybridization using a mixture of digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled probes specific to TYLCV and TYLCSV. infectious clones are separated by an intergenic non-coding region (IR) that contains the origin of replication in a region that adopts a stem-loop structure. young apical leaves were harvested at 15, 30, and 45 dpi. DNA was extracted following the Edwards' procedure. extracts were centrifuged at 12,000 g at room temperature for 5 min. full-lenght genomic consensus sequences were obtained by direct sequencing (Macrogen Inc., South Korea) Primers used to sequence consensus sequences of TYLCSV, TYLCV, and TYLCMaV are indicated in Table 1.

Graphs show viral loads (number of ssDNA genomes per ng of total DNA) in apical leaf samples from individual test plants. no viral accumulation was detected at any time point for TYLCSV/common bean or TYLCV/S. nigrum infections either by hybridization or qPCR. TYLCV and TYLCSV were sustained along the experiment (P >0.010). the results suggest better performance of TYLCV and TYLCSV in common bean and in S. nigrum respectively. heterogeneity refers to the proportion of different viral genomes in the mutant spectrum, as measured by Shannon entropy. DNA samples from one infected plant per virus/host combination at each time point were subjected to rolling circle amplification (RCA) as a measure to reduce amplification bias we amplified 3\u20137 108 input viral molecules. bean was higher than resistant tomato at 15 dpi (P = 0.025) and also higher at 30 dpi than resistant tomato (P = 0.034) only in TYLCV, CP (P = 0.030) and V2 (P = 0.045) regions showed more complexity in resistant tomato. sequences of 1,437 nucleotides for TYLCSV, 1,438 nucleotides for TYLCV and 1,429 nucleotides for TYLCMaV from molecular clones were aligned and compared to their consensus sequences. only mutations (base substitutions and indels) relative to the consensus sequence of each quasispecies were computed. 0 0/21 2.546 0 0/21 0.616 0 45(1) 0/19 1.530 0 0/19 2.815 0 1/19 1.714 0.047 0/19 2.815 0 4/19 2.723 0.274 45(2)d 0/16 1.817 0 0/16 3.342 0 1/16 2.036 0.084 2/16 6.684 0.167 5/16 4.043 0.405 TYLCV 15 0/20 1.453 0.074 1/18 1.810 0.074 0/18 2.971 0 0/18 0.719 0 RT TYLCSV 15 2/20 2.907 0.034 2/20 5.348 0.034 3/20 4.886 0.196 0/20 2.674 0 1/20 0.647 0.034 30 2/20 2.907 0.132 1/20 2.674 0.034 1/20 1.629 0.034 1/20 2.674 0.034 2/20 1.294 0.132 45 74 0.034 1/20 1.603 0.034 0/21 2.546 0 1/21 0.616 0.032 45(1) 0/21 1.384 0 0/21 2.546 0 1/21 1.526 0.032 1/21 2.546 0.032 2/21 1.232 0.125 45(2) 2/18 3.230 0.147 1/18 2.971 0.074 0/18 1.810 0/18 1.810 0 2/18 1.437 0.147 CB TYLCV 15 0 5/19 3.458 0.339 SN TYLCSV 15 0/19 1.530 0 0/19 2.815 0 1/19 2.043 0.207 30 1/19 1.530 0.035 1/19 2.815 0.035 3/19 2.043 0.207 30 1/19 1.530 0.035 1/19 2.971 0.037 3/18 2.156 0.219 45(1) 0/20 1.453 0 0/20 2.674 0 3/20 4.886 0.196 3/19 8.444 d values varied from 0.00012 to 0.00173. the maximum genetic distance values for the four coding regions and the IR were found in the V2 region. high d values were also observed for C4 in some cases. 15 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00060 0.00057 0.00000 0.00000 0.00060 0.00014 0.00014 30 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00062 0.00060 0.00013 0.00013 45 (1) 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00062 0.00060 0.00013 0.00013 0.00013 45 (1) 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.000 0.00056 0.00013 0.00012 45 (1) 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00056 0.00054 0.00054 0.00054 0.00026 45 (2) 0.00036 0.00035 0.00075 0.00075 0.00036 0.00034 0.00121 0.00081 0.00081 0.00081 0.00081 0.00081 0.000115 0.00055 TYLCMaV 15 0.00061 0.00041 0.00056 0.00054 0.00054 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00015 0.00015 SN TYLCSV 15 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00015 0.00015 0.00015 SN TYLCSV 15 0.00000 0.00000 0.00000 0.00035 0.00034 0.00041 0.00023 30 0.00031 0.00030 0.00056 0.00043 0.00022 45 (1) 0.00000 0.00000 0.00059 0.00043 0.00022 45 (1) 0.00000 0.00000 0.00098 the lowest Shannon entropy values in the four hosts were detected in the C4 genomic region, except for TYLCSV at 15 dpi in resistant tomato. the wild host S. nigrum contained the most heterogeneous populations at later infection time points for the viruses that were able to infect it. the IR contained the highest fraction of insertions, representing 11.1% of all mutations in the region. the most common transition was C T, which was highly enriched in C4 and V2 regions.

TYLCCNV is a virus with resistance-breaking properties. it is a virus with resistance-breaking properties. TYLCMaV is a virus with resistance-breaking properties. this was already observed in resistant tomato. TYLCMaV is able to overcome the growth restriction conferred by the Ty-1 gene. despite the genome sequences of the recombinant virus sharing 99% identity with the corresponding parental virus sequences, an improved combination of coding and/or nonconding regions may have been selected. the Ty-1 allele impairs the accumulation of begomoviruses involved in TYLCD. the role of this region in permitting viral accumulation in the presence of Ty-1 merits further study. the key to overcoming Ty-1 resistance resides in this particular combination of nucleotide changes. the presence of putative low fitness variants in mutant spectra could be the result of compensatory mutations to maintain RNA secondary structure. TYLCMaV CP R18C (C360T) amino acid change is adjacent to R19L. CP mutations Q76E, Y78H, K80T, and R82C would affect the putative zinc finger motif, thus potentially impairing the ssDNA binding capacity of this protein. the nonanucleotide sequence conserved in all geminiviruses and the cleavage site for the initiation of rolling-circle replication in the stem-loop are also shown. it could be argued that the probability of sequencing genomes with low frequency is expected to be extremely low because of a potential RCA bias. qPCR analysis of 20 clones per quasispecies may appear insufficient. assuming each clone is present with a relative frequency of at least 5% within the quasispecies, it means that we might be detecting at least a portion of the most frequent viral variants that are high fitness variants. common bean is usually employed as a transition host between tomato crops. mutations arising in wild reservoirs could be transmitted to crop plants by the insect vector B. tabaci. TYLCMaV can efficiently infect the Ty-1-resistant tomato. ties development exist in tomato that are absent from the other hosts. it has been suggested that rates of mutation fixation can be higher when viruses are under positive selection, such as when they are adapting to a new host or to cell culture. this could lead to the evolution and novel exploration of the sequence space. author contributions SS-C, DT, EM, JN-C, and AG-P: conceived and designed the experiments; SS-C, GD-H, LD-M, and AG-P: wrote the main manuscript text and prepared figures. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
