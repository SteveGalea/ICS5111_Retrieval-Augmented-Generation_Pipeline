{"summary": "the first new infectious disease of this millennium. the disease is caused by a novel, SARS-associated coronavirus. the first cases of the disease were reported from a hospital in Hanoi, Vietnam. scientists have revealed basic mechanisms of the underlying causative agent, the SARS coronavirus. it is crucial for future strategies that SARS is detected in its earliest stages. insights into molecular mechanism of SARS have to be used to develop new therapeutic strategies and vaccines. coronaviruses in civet cats have a sequence identity of more than 99% to the civet cat virus. this animal coronavirus was shown to have a sequence identity of more than 99% to the SARS coronavirus [18] with only a limited number of deletions and mutations. human coronavirus OC43 shares a high degree of genetic sequence homology to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) it is commonly assumed that it has jumped from one species to the other [21,22] in the same way, BCoV has been reported to be able to infect humans and cause diarrhea [23]. Until the identification of the new SARS-CoV, the coronaviruses have been divided into three subgroups. coV may represent the first member of a new group of coronaviruses. however, the taxonomy is still no clear [19,25]. recent studies focused on the N-terminal domain of the spike protein have suggested a relation to group II viruses. a series of ORFs of unknown function was found between the spike and the envelope genes and three to five ORFs between the membrane and nucleocapsid genes. the gene 1a-1b encodes two polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, the latter through a ribosomal ribosomal ribosom. most potential gene 1a-1b products are fairly well conserved between SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses. many of their functions are unknown but it is suggested that they participate in viral RNA replication. so far, five to eight subgenomic mRNAs were found in SARS-CoV-infected cells [17,27] Thiel and colleagues performed the first detailed study on mechanisms and enzymes involved in SARS-CoV genome expression. they determined the sequence of the SARS-CoV isolate Frankfurt 1 and characterized the major RNA elements and proteins involved in the genome expression. the spike proteins of coronaviruses are reported to bind to receptors on their target cells. the domains responsible for receptor-binding are commonly situated in the N-terminal region of S1. the spikes consist of oligomeric structures, formed by heptad repeats of the S2 domain which also represent a fusion peptide sequence. virus MHV-A59 the coexpression of the E and M proteins but not the S or N proteins is needed for the release of virus-like particles (VLP) the nucleocapsid and viral core of the SARS-CoV are likely to be formed by the N protein. the resistance against the gastrointestinal fluids despite the lipid composition of their envelope is unclear. a further threat of the SARS-CoV is based on the ability of coronaviruses to undergo RNA recombination at a high frequency. both mutations in natural infections have been shown to contribute to the diversification of the coronaviruses. the question of potential chronic SARS infections is of major importance for a future disease control. RNA was found in patients' stool specimen more than 30 days after the infections. the mean incubation period of SARS was estimated to be 6.4 days (95% confidence interval, 5.2 to 7.7) main clinical features of the disease are in the initial period common symptoms such as persistent fever, myalgia, chills, dry cough, dizziness, and headache. a milder clinical presentation of SARS in children is most likely due to differences in developmental stage of the immune system. the common presenting features are fever, malaise, coryza, cough, chills or rigor, headache, myalgia, leucopaenia, thrombocytopaenia, lymphopaenia. coronavirus infection often results in cytopathic effects such as cellular lysis or apoptosis. the virus can cause cellular fusion leading to the formation of syncytia. a further similarity with other coronaviruses seems to be the potential of the SARS-CoV to cause tissue fibrosis. the pharmacotherapy for SARS with anti-inflammatory steroids is controversial. it was reported that the initial use of pulse methylprednisolone therapy appears to be more efficacious and equally safe when compared with regimens with lower dosage. it should therefore be considered as the preferred steroid regimen in the treatment of SARS, pending data from future randomized controlled trials. 'non-essential' ORFs of the group 2 mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) lead to a lower virulence without an impact on viral replication. other viral gene products such as the M or E proteins may have an impact on the pathogenesis of the disease. group I coronaviruses bind to aminopeptidase N (CD13) as receptors. group II coronaviruses such as MHV use carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) as receptors. anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibodies blocked viral replication on vero E6 cells. the next molecular step of potential use for the development of anti-SARS drugs is the virus entry into the cells. most coronaviruses express one major cysteine proteinase, called the main proteinase (Mpro) the latter two are responsible for the cleavage of the viral polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, at three sites near the amino-terminus. the Mpro processes these proteins at as many as 11 additional sites. this is possible since operation of the PL2pro on PL1pro sites has been shown in IBV and HCoV [86]. anand et al. have synthesized a substrate-analogous hexapeptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitor and bound it to TGEV Mpro in the crystalline state. the structure revealed binding of the P1 glutamine, P2 leucine, and P4 threonine side chains of this compound to the respective subsites in the substrate-binding cleft. the same hexapeptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitor was used by anand et al. [85] in their crystallographic study of the TGEV Mpro. the binding mode of the inhibitor to the active monomer resembled that of AG7088 in complex with its target, the 3C proteinase of human rhinovirus. molecular dynamics simulations of the Mpro and screened 29 approved and experimental drugs against a model of the SARS CoV proteinase as well as the experimental structure of the TGEV proteinase [91]. it was suggested existing HIV-1 protease inhibitors, L-700,417 for instance, may have high binding affinities. further potential targets are the E and M proteins as they represent the minimum essential components for the assembly of coronaviruses which form the virus-like siRNAs are double-stranded RNAs which lead to a sequence-specific degradation of mRNAs. studies used six 21-mer siRNAs targeted to different sites of the replicase 1A region of SARS-CoV. three of the six siRNAs led to a marked inhibition of virus cytopathic effects and a reduction of virus copies between 85 and 92 %. recombinant subunit vaccines will be developed and used. recombinant subunit vaccines are expected to be created relatively easy. recombinant subunit vaccines may have a limited ability to protect against SARS-CoV infections. recombinant vectored vaccines could be a promising target. a multi-valent approach which induces both humoral and cell-mediated host responses seems to be the most attractive strategy. a DNA vaccine was developed which contains the nucleocapsid protein gene of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. adenoviral delivery of a codon-optimised SARS-CoV spike protein S1 fragment, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein can induce immunity in rhesus macaques. adenoviral delivery of a codon-optimised SARS-CoV spike protein S1 fragment, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein has been shown to induce immunity in monkeys. a group of positive-sense RNA viruses consisting of coronaviridae and arteriviridae are known to synthesize a 3' co-terminal set of subgenomic mRNAs in the infected cells. animal species of this area have been speculated to be the origin of the new virus. the ability of the SARS-CoV to infect other animal species could point to potential natural reservoirs of the virus. the human coronavirus OC43 shares a high degree of genetic sequence homology to bovine coronavirus (BCoV) it is commonly assumed that it has jumped from one species to the other [21,22] the family of coronaviruses belongs to the order of nidovirales. it is still debatable whether the new SARS-CoV should be assigned to group II or to a new fourth group. the structure of the SARS viral RNA is organized in 13\u201315 open reading frames (ORF) and contains a total of approximately 30,000 nucleotides. 61 SARS-CoV sequences derived from the early, middle, and late phases of the SARS epidemic together with two viral sequences from palm civets were analyzed. two-thirds of the SARS RNA is organized in the gene 1a-1b. the sequence of this gene is highly conserved among all coronaviruses. many of their functions are unknown but it is suggested they participate in viral RNA replication. some of these non-essential ORFs of the new SARS-CoV genome may be responsible for the high SARS-CoV virulence. some of these non-essential ORFs of the new SARS-CoV genome may be responsible for the high virulence. the spike glycoprotein is responsible for the characteristic spikes of the SARS-CoV. the spike proteins of coronaviruses are reported to bind to receptors on their target cells. the spikes consist of oligomeric structures, formed by heptad repeats of the S2 domain which also represent a fusion peptide sequence. the SARS-CoV S protein seems to have most of its characteristics in common with the S proteins of other coronaviruses. but it will be important for the understanding of the pathogenic properties to identify the exact conditions of membrane fusion, i.e. pH dependency and protease sensitivity, which can increase the infectivity. a further threat of the SARS-CoV is based on the ability of coronaviruses to undergo RNA recombination at a high frequency. it was reported that in the initial phases of the SARS epidemic, the mutation rate was high in the gene for the spike protein, but stabilized during the middle and final stages of the 2003 epidemy. stool of patients for longer periods than 6 weeks after hospital discharge has not been reported so far. most animal coronaviruses cause persistent infections. TGEV and MHV tend to cause chronic infections as these viruses may be found in the airways and small intestine. radiological progression of acute pneumonia is concomitant with a fall in the viral load. about 20% of patients may progress to the third and critical phase. sensitivity approaching 80% in the first 3 days of illness. studies using cell culture assays have shown that coronavirus infection commonly results in cytopathic effects such as cellular lysis or apoptosis. a further similarity with other coronaviruses seems to be the potential of the SARS-CoV to cause tissue fibrosis. cytopathic effects are caused by steps of the viral replication. the virus can cause cellular fusion leading to the formation of syncytia. similarity with other coronaviruses seems to be potential of the SARS-CoV to cause tissue fibrosis [63] pharmacotherapy for SARS with anti-inflammatory steroids is controversial. it was reported that the initial use of pulse methylprednisolone therapy appears to be more efficacious and equally safe when compared with regimens with lower dosage. it should therefore be considered as the preferred steroid regimen in the treatment of SARS, pending data from future randomized controlled trials. if this also applies to 'non-essential' ORFs of SARS-CoV. other viral gene products such as the M or E proteins may have an impact on the pathogenesis of the disease. a metallopeptidase, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), efficiently binds the S1 domain of the SARS-CoV S protein. anti-ACE2 but not anti-ACE1 antibodies blocked viral replication on vero E6 cells, indicating that ACE2 is a functional receptor for SARS-CoV. most coronaviruses express one major cysteine proteinase, called the main proteinase (Mpro) or the 3C-like proteinase (3CLpro), and two auxiliary, papain-like proteinases (PL1pro and PL2pro) the latter two are responsible for the cleavage of viral RNA synthesis. pp1a and pp1ab processes these proteins at three sites near the amino-terminus. operation of the PL2pro on PL1pro cleavage sites has been shown in IBV and HCoV [86]. it is not known whether the SUD protein is ever expressed in the life cycle of SARS-CoV. anand et al. have synthesized a substrate-analogous hexapeptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitor and bound it to TGEV Mpro in the crystalline state. the X-ray structure revealed binding of the P1 glutamine, P2 leucine, and P4 threonine side chains of this compound to the respective subsites in the substrate-binding cleft. the same hexapeptidyl chloromethylketone inhibitor was used by anand et al. [85] in their crystallographic study of the TGEV Mpro. the binding mode of the inhibitor to the active monomer resembled that of AG7088 in complex with its target, the 3C proteinase of human rhinovirus. enteritis virus (TGEV) proteinase [91] may have high binding affinities. it was suggested existing HIV-1 protease inhibitors, L-700,417, may have high binding affinities. further potential targets are the E and M proteins. siRNAs were targeted to different sites of the replicase 1A region of SARS-CoV. three of the six siRNAs led to a marked inhibition of virus cytopathic effects. the 1A region displays a promising region to suppress virus replication. there are several options to develop vaccines against the SARS virus. recombinant subunit vaccines are expected to be created relatively easy. the approach of recombinant subunit vaccines may have to be supplemented by further vaccine strategies which focus on cell-mediated immunity. a multi-valent approach which induces both humoral and cell-mediated host responses seems to be the most attractive strategy. a recombinant fowlpox with the S1 gene of IBV was demonstrated to be relatively protective against IBV. a DNA vaccine was developed which contains the nucleocapsid protein gene of porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus. adenoviral delivery of a codon-optimised SARS-CoV spike protein S1 fragment, membrane protein, and nucleocapsid protein can induce immunity in rhesus macaques. the onset of the SARS epidemic in different continents has led to the formation of a successful laboratory network to identify the molecular mechanisms underlying the virus. sliga (DAG) is also gratefully acknowledged."}
