{"summary": "PCR mixture and thermal cycling PCR mixture consisted of 6L Roche LightCycler TaqMan Master Mix (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) and 1 L 20X EvaGreen Dye in water. synthetic complementary DNA templates (ATG Biosynthesis, Germany) for haemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) for the avian influenza virus (H7N9) were added at different concentrations. the PCR protocol consisted of a hot start for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C followed by 40 cycles each consisting of two steps, denaturation for 5 s at 95 \u00b0C and annealing/extension for 30 s at 60 \u00b0C. fluorescence amplitude was continuously monitored using an Axiotron II microscope (Zeiss, Germany) the fluorescence amplitude during transition from extension/annealing step to denaturation step was then extracted for each cycle and fluorescence as function of temperature was plotted. the melting curve captured at the first cycle was subtracted from all melting curves to suppress a background fluorescence effect. extracting the fluorescence amplitude from the derived curves for each cycle at 68 \u00b0C and 76 \u00b0C respectively, results in two PCR amplification curves. amplification curves extracted for the experiments with a higher concentration of NA than HA (experiments A1 to A5 in Table 2). the sample spiked with the cDNA of the HA gene yielded only a single amplification curve with melting temperature of 76 \u00b0C. it was found that the difference in CT corresponded to the expected difference according to the ratio of concentrations of HA and NA. the MCAs are recorded at a scanning rate of over 20 \u00b0C/s. the commercial systems for high resolution melting curve analysis (HRMCA)17 are usually operating with low temperature scan rates between 0.1 \u00b0C/s and 0.5 \u00b0C/s. VRC-based RT-PCR demonstrating almost all those steps was shown earlier, detecting both RNA from H5N1 avian influenza virus19 as well as from virus of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)20. processing clinical sample containing virus would also require laboratory classified as biosafety hazard level 3 which we do not have available. a droplet with a volume of 150 nL of the PCR solution was placed on a hydrophobically coated microscope glass cover slip and covered with 1.5 L of mineral oil 9405. this glass was then placed on a micromachined silicon chip integrated with both a heater and a sensor. the silicon chip has a size of only 15 15 mm to better fit a handheld PCR device we are developing. the temperature of the PCR chip was also recorded by the oscilloscope at the same data rate. samples were also analyzed using the Roche LightCycler Carousel-Based system (Roche Diagnostics, Germany) this procedure was applied to a sample containing only a single amplicon (HA) with melting temperature of 76 \u00b0C. we have added to the sample a second amplicon (NA) with a melting temperature of 68 \u00b0C. a second peak corresponding to this amplicon can be observed in the respective MCA. the difference in CT (CT) corresponded to the expected difference according to the ratio of concentrations of HA and HA. the results indicate that CT corresponds to the expected values. the method can be used for multiplexed quantitative PCR. sample A5 has the concentration of NA 19 times higher than HA. Fig. 4B shows the fluorescence amplitude plotted as function of temperature with a temperature gradient of 0.1 \u00b0C/s. both melting temperatures found on the LightCycler are 8 \u00b0C higher than the temperatures we measured in our system. however this Tm offset has no influence on quality of the results especially when this lag is known. we have 100% control of the method using a homemade PCR system. any commercial real-time PCR device would be capable of performing the same protocol as long as it has available fluorescent amplitude sampling rate."}
