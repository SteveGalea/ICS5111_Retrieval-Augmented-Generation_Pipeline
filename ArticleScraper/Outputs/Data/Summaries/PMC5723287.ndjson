{"summary": "HRVs are respiratory viruses that belong to the family Picornaviridae and genus Enterovirus. HRVs are the leading cause of upper respiratory tract infections worldwide. annual economic costs associated with HRV infections are likely to exceed 60 billion dollars per year. rates among young children can be as high as 8\u201312 times a year. asymptomatic infections of the nasopharynx are quite common for rhinoviruses. rhinovirus infections are often linked to acute otitis media and rhinosinusitis. a study evaluating 3 to 18-year-old patients admitted with wheezing identified nearly half tested positive for HRV (Heymann et al., 2004). Approximately, 90% of children hospitalized with acute asthma attacks were shown to have detectable HRV (Heymann et al., 2004). the viral capsid of HRV is comprised of four viral proteins (VPs): VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4. the remaining viral proteins are responsible for viral replication and subsequent assembly. three distinct species of human rhinovirus have been identified. VP1 mediates cell surface attachment through engagement of a variety of cell surface receptors. a minority of HRV types used the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) for binding. phylogenetic diversity of Rhinoviruses Three species of rhinovirus are currently known: HRV-A, HRV-B, and HRV-C. however, sequencing and serologic methods have defined approximately 83 HRV-A types, 32 HRV-B types, and 55 HRV-C types with potentially as many as 150 to 170 serological distinct HRV types. over half of all HRV infections in young infants are now recognized as HRV-C strains. among HRV types detected during childhood acute asthma episodes, HRV-C was the more frequently detected species (Bizzintino et al., 2011). research has shown that HRV-C selectively targets ciliated airway epithelial cells which express CDHR3. findings pave the way for more thorough study of HRV-C biology. development of an effective rhinovirus vaccine for the common cold will need to include antigenic coverage from representative HRV-C strains. despite advances in cell culture resulting in increased titers of virus, the shear technical challenge remains a key technical challenge. there remains insufficient surveillance and epidemiologic data to accurately identify which specific dominant HRV-A and HRV-C types to prioritize in vaccine preparations to mitigate disease. unattenuated HRV, or HRV inactivated by formalin or heat, was capable of inducing antibodies following intramuscular injection. circulating antibody levels correlated inversely with associated illness. in the early 1970s, the first studies evaluating cross-neutralization and serologic reactivity between many HRV types were published which opened the door for the earliest attempts at polyvalent vaccine preparations. the first capsid HRV crystal structure (HRV-14) was resolved in Rossmann et al. (1985) over 70 structures of all three species of HRV would soon be determined with over 70 now deposited in the protein data bank (PDB) expression of a recombinant VP0 in combination with a Th1-focused adjuvant was effective at promoting strong Th1-specific cross-serotype antibody responses. cross-reactive antigens may be used to increase serological breadth of HRV coverage while limiting the number of types of antigens necessary. advances in HRV reverse genetics and the potential to create chimeric virus preparations collectively suggest that development of an HRV vaccine is not technically impossible. advances in HRV reverse genetics and the potential to create chimeric virus preparations collectively suggest that development of an HRV vaccine is not technically impossible."}
