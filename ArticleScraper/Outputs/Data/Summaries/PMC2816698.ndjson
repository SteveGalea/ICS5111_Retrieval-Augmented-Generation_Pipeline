{"summary": "WNV is a neurotropic flavivirus and is an emerging public health threat. it is enveloped and contains a single strand positive sense RNA genome. it encodes three structural (C, prM/M, and E) and seven non-structural proteins. it cycles enzootically between birds and Culex mosquitoes. PRR signaling directs downstream activation of latent transcription factors. NF-B, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3 and IRF-7 induce antiviral response programs. the ISG products induced through autocrine and paracrine actions of IFN confer antiviral activity by limiting virus replication and cell-to-cell virus spread. IG-I, MDA5 or those deficient in IPS-1 alone were unable to respond to infection with WNV and related flaviviruses [19],[20],[21],[22]. recent studies examined the role of another class of pattern recognition receptors, toll like receptor (TLR)3 and TLR7. these receptors play a role in signaling IFN production and an inflammatory response upon viral ligand recognition. RIG-I and IPS-1-dependent signaling are essential for protection against WNV infection. we further evaluated WNV infection of RIG-I/ or MDA5/ mice. we also examined the role of IPS-1 in protection against WNV infection on a sub-lethal virus challenge of wild type and IPS-1/ mice. infectious virus in the (C) spleen, (D) kidney, (E) brain and (F) spinal cord were determined by RT-qPCR assay (B) or viral plaque assay (C\u2013F) of samples harvested on day 1, 2, 4, and 6 pi. data are shown as copies of WNV genome RNA per ml of serum or PFU per gram of tissue for 3 to 6 mice per timepoint. IPS-1-dependent signaling controls WNV replication, tissue tropis IPS-1 regulates the innate immune response to WNV infection in myeloid cells. myeloid cells, including tissue and lymphoid DC and macrophages (M), are among the first cells to encounter WNV during infection. IPS-1 regulates the innate immune response to WNV infection in myeloid cells. WNV infection of IPS-1/ M resulted in significantly higher virus replication between 24 and 48 hours pi. IPS-1-dependent RLR signaling is the major innate immune signaling pathway that controls virus replication in conventional DCs and M. lysates from mock-infected (M) and WN-TX infected cells were normalized at each timepoint to loading control. STAT-1 expression in dendritic cells was normalized at each timepoint to loading control and compared to mock (relative fold induction WT, KO at 12 hours 1.72, 0.7; 24 hours 2.6, 0.8; 36 hours 4.6, 1.1; 48 hours 9.9, 0.6) expression of ISGs, including RIG-I and MDA5) and IRF-3 target genes followed this pattern. presence of IFN- and ISG transcripts in IPS-1/ cells at 48 hrs pi is consistent with the finding that TLR3 has an independent and subordinate role in triggering innate immune responses. IPS-1 is essential for triggering innate immune defenses and controlling virus replication during WNV infection of primary cortical neurons. cellular infiltrates were present in the parenchyma and neuronal destruction was observed throughout the cortex and hippocampus. damaged neurons appeared pyknotic with vacuolation, degeneration and cell dropout. surprisingly, we observed extensive inflammation in the brains from infected IPS-1/ mice within the cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum. brains from IPS-1/ infected mice showed an 2.9-fold increase in immune cells. this was associated with an increase in absolute numbers of infiltrating CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. similar findings were observed in the spinal cords from infected IPS-1/ mice. we measured levels of systemic type I IFN, proinflammatory cytokines, and chemokines in the serum of IPS-1/ mice at 1 and/or 4 days pi. a trend towards more rapid induction and increased levels of type I IFN was observed in the serum of IPS-1/ mice compared to wild type mice. a trend towards more rapid induction and increased levels of type I IFN was observed in this case. a time course analysis in wild type and IPS-1/ infected mice showed that between 4 and 6 days pi, WNV-infected IPS-1/ mice exhibited significantly higher levels of virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgG subclasses. IPS-1/ infected mice showed a modest increase in neutralization titer to 11280. the difference translated into a serum neutralization index that was 39-fold lower on day 6 pi in the infected IPS-1/ mice. c Neutralization index was calculated by dividing PRNT50 titers by the total IgMa plus IgGb titer for each point. wild type and IPS-1/ mice were challenged with diluent alone or with WN-TX, and draining popliteal lymph node (DLN) and the spleen were harvested at 1 and 6 days pi. this DC subset is monocyte-derived and typically recruited to sites of acute inflammation where they propagate the inflammatory response. we found that these DC subsets were not significantly expanded and showed no differences in their recruitment to the DLN in either wild type or IPS-1/ infected mice at 12 hours pi. thus, as early as 24 hours pi, an elevated cellular inflammatory response is initiated in the IPS-1/ mice. in contrast, similar increases in plasmacytoid DCs were observed within in wild type and IPS-1/ mice were mock-infected (M) or infected with WN-TX (W) cells were isolated and cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. total numbers of cells expressing various dendritic cell surface markers, (D) plasmacytoid cell surface markers. spleens from infected IPS-1/ mice showed significantly increased numbers of CD8+ T cells compared to those from wild type and IPS-1/ mice. spleens from infected IPS-1/ mice showed significantly increased numbers of CD8+ T cells in comparison to those from wild type mice. IPS-1/ mice contained greater numbers of NK cells (CD4CD8NK1.1+cells), NKT cells (CD4+/CD8+/NK1.1+ cells) and neutrophils (CD11b+Gr1+ cells) a deficiency of IPS-1 resulted in a more marked enhancement of these immune cell populations. adult wild type and IPS-1/ mice were infected s.c. with 100 PFU of WN-TX. IPS-1-dependent signaling controls WNV replication, tissue tropism, and CNS invasion. viral loads in the spleen were elevated in the infected IPS-1/ mice. virus was found in the kidneys, a tissue that is not permissive to infection in wild type mice. IPS-1 regulates the innate immune response to WNV infection in myeloid cells. IPS-1/ DCs sustained significantly higher WNV replication at 36 and 48 hours pi compared to wild type infected cells. lack of IFN- induction in IPS-1/ DCs correlated with lack of ISG expression including RIG-I, MDA5 and STAT-1. primary bone-marrow derived dendritic cells (A\u2013C) and macrophages (D\u2013F) recovered from wild type mice and IPS-1/ mice were mock-infected (M) or infected with WN-TX at an MOI of 1.0. IFN- expression was induced to lower levels in IPS-1/ neurons compared to wild type infected neurons at 24 (10-fold, p0.05) and 36 hours pi (5-fold, p0.05) despite higher levels of virus replication. IPS-1 is essential for triggering innate immune defenses and controlling virus replication during WNV infection. analysis of brain tissue from wild type and IPS-1/ mice infected with WN-TX revealed little or no inflammation or neuronal damage. brain sections from infected IPS-1/ mice recovered on day 6 pi showed extensive injury to neurons in the cortex and hippocampus. damaged neurons appeared pyknotic with vacuolation, degeneration and cell dropout. the total number of brain lymphocytes was determined by cell counting. total number of lymphocytes was determined by cell counting. lymphocytes were isolated from infected brains on day 6 pi. similar findings were observed in the spinal cords from infected IPS-1/ mice. in the absence of IPS-1, WNV infection induces a strong inflammatory response in the CNS. failure of this increased inflammatory response suggests a role for the RLR signaling pathway as a regulatory program that controls the quality of the inflammatory response to WNV infection. increased serum levels of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were observed at 1 and/or 4 days pi in uninfected wild type and IPS-1/ mice. increased levels of systemic IL-6, TNF-, CXCL10, and IFN- were observed at 1 and/or 4 days pi in IPS-1/ mice. a time course analysis in wild type and IPS-1/ infected mice showed that between 4 and 6 days pi, WNV-infected IPS-1/ mice showed significantly higher levels of virus-specific IgM, IgG, and IgG subclasses as compared to infected wild type mice. IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a titers were determined by an arbitrary cutoff at an OD of 0.2 minus the value from mock infected mice. b IgG, IgG1 and IgG2a titers were determined by an arbitrary cutoff at an OD of 0.2. analysis of CD8 DC subsets showed that infected wild type and IPS-1/ mice showed similar increases in the numbers of CD8+ and CD8 DCs compared to mock-infected mice. however, a significant increase (3-fold; p0.05) of a proinflammatory DC subset, characterized as CD11c+CD11bhiLy6C+, was observed within the popliteal DLNs of IPS-1/ infected mice at 12 hours pi WNV infection of wild type mice increased the number of B cells (3.4 fold), CD4+ T cells (3.1 fold), and CD8+ T cells (2.3 fold; p0.05) in the DLN within 24 hours pi. however, the number of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was reduced. wild type and IPS-1/ mice were mock-infected (M) or infected with WN-TX (W) wild type and IPS-1/ mice were mock-infected (M) or infected with WN-TX (W) Spleens were harvested and immune cells were isolated. spleens from infected IPS-1/ mice showed significantly higher numbers of CD8+ T cells in comparison to those from wild type and IPS-1/ mice. spleens from infected IPS-1/ mice showed significantly higher numbers of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells producing IFN. adaptive immune regulation with the innate immunity triggered by RLR signaling during WNV infection. in vivo analysis of infected IPS-1/ mice showed altered IgG and IgM antibody responses with diminished virus neutralization activity. dysregulated inflammatory response to WNV infection is regulated by IPS-1-dependent processes such that a deficiency of IPS-1 resulted in elevated proinflammatory cytokine and chemokines. a distinct set of RLR-responsive genes function to control virus replication. this could explain elevated levels of virus replication, enhanced tissue tropism and cell-to-cell spread in mice or cells deficient in IRF3 or IRF-7. pDCs, which are specialized dendritic cells for producing systemic type I IFN during a viral infection, are likely contributing to the IFN responses observed during WNV infection. infection of IPS-1/ mice exhibited increased IgM and IgG WNV-specific antibodies, enhanced WNV-specific CD8+T cell response, and increased expansion of neutrophils, NK cells and NK-T cells. one trivial explanation for these differences is that there is an increased antigen load in the absence of IPS-1 and, as a result, enhanced virus-specific (e.g. CD8+ T cells, IgG and IgM antibodies) and nonspecific ( in the absence of IPS-1 signaling, infected conventional DCs or M, likely do not produce IFN or the normal array and level of proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines. however, in the absence of IPS-1 signaling, infected conventional DCs or M, likely do not produce IFN or the normal array and level of proinflammatory cytokines/ chemokines. studies have implicated an integral role for Tregs in controlling inflammation and adaptive immune responses during acute virus infections [26],[43],[44]. During acute infection Tregs function to locally contain and control the immune response with the dual outcome of suppressing viral dissemination while decreasing the likelihood of immune-mediated pathology. oviruses, picornaviruses, reoviruses, flaviviruses, and hepatitis C virus likely to have a broad impact on the control of inflammation, immune response quality, and viral disease. mice were genotyped and bred under pathogen-free conditions in the animal facility at the University of Washington. infected mice were euthanized, bled, and perfused with 20 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) whole brain, spinal cord, kidney, and spleen were removed, weighed, homogenized in 500ul of PBS. primary cell isolation and infection Bone-marrow derived DC and M were generated as described previously.
