{"summary": "middle east respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first detected in a patient living in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia in September of 2012. human infections across the Arabian Peninsula, occasional importation of cases outside the Arabian Peninsula, and associated clusters in other regions of the world. limited human-to-human transmission has occurred in healthcare settings from unprotected contact with or inadequate infection prevention and control measures in the care of MERS patients. outbreaks associated with a barn in KSA [21,22,23] and in Qatar [17,24] inferred animal-to-human transmission following parallel dromedary and human infections. field surveys have been conducted on several domestic and wildlife species, including dromedary and Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus), goats, bats, cattle, sheep, chickens, swine, ducks, buffalo, and equids. the international health regulations (2005) require all laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections to be reported to the world health organization. since 2015, individual case data reported to WHO includes information on travel history, contact with a confirmed or probable human MERS case, contact with dromedaries, and visits to human healthcare facilities within the 14 days prior to symptom onset. case data reported to WHO includes information on exposures during the 14 days before symptom onset or when laboratory confirmation was reported. direct exposure to dromedaries was defined as touching, feeding, cleaning, slaughtering, milking, assisting with birth of camelids. indirect exposure to dromedaries is defined as visiting camel areas (e.g., markets, racing tracks, farms) without directly touching a camel. study design and participants Retrospective analysis performed on epidemiological data of all laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases reported to WHO between 1 January 2015 and 13 April 2018. unclassified cases are cases with insufficient information reported to WHO, on potential exposures prior to infection, to be classified as a primary or non-primary case. indirect exposure to dromedaries is defined as visiting camel areas without touching a camel. any contact with dromedaries is defined as any direct or indirect contact. any contact with dromedaries is defined as any direct or indirect contact. 57.7 (SD 15.8) years, 86.5% were male and 96.3% reported MERS-CoV exposure in KSA (Table 1). Table 1 provides further description of laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infections reported to WHO between 1 January 2015 and 13 April 2018. results are presented as frequencies (%), unless otherwise stated. 245 21.8 79 22.7 109 24.0 57 17.7 Died 414 36.8 151 43.4 149 32.8 114 35.4 Not reported 466 41.4 118 33.9 197 43.3 151 46.9 MERS-CoV: Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus; non-ICU: non-intensive care unit; primary case = cases with laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection with no direct epidemiological link to a (confirmed or probable) human M results are presented as frequencies (%), unless otherwise stated. n % n % n % n % Any contact with dromedaries Yes 235 20.9 191 54.9 5 1.1 39 12.1 No 276 24.5 62 17.8 162 35.6 52 16.2 Not reported 614 54.6 95 27.3 288 63.3 231 71.7 Direct contact with dromedaries. all, primary, non-primary, and unclassified cases reporting indirect contact with dromedaries were the most frequent type of dromedary camel product consumed. primary cases were more likely to be older (p 0.001), and with a higher proportion of males compared to non-primary cases (p 0.001). primary cases were also shown to have greater contact (both direct and indirect) with dromedaries compared to non-primary cases (p 0.001). of the 1125 cases, the mean age was 54.9 (SD 17.3) years, 71.8% were male and 90.0% reported MERS-CoV exposure in KSA. of the 348 primary cases, the mean age was 57.7 (SD 15.8) years, 86.5% were male and 96.3% reported MERS-CoV exposure in KSA.
