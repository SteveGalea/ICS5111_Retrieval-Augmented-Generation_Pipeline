{"summary": "arenaviruses are divided into two groups: Old World (OW) and New World (NW) arenaviruses. members of both groups can cause hemorrhagic fever (HF) disease in humans and pose a serious public health problem in their endemic regions. increased travel to and from endemic regions has resulted in importation of LF cases into non-endemic regions. arenaviruses are enveloped, negative-sense RNA viruses with bisegmented genomes. each segment uses an ambisense coding strategy to direct the synthesis of two proteins in opposite orientation. NP counteracts the host type I interferon response by preventing activation of the interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and subsequent induction of IFN-I production and interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) the anti-IFN-I function of NP has been mapped to its C-terminal region. the same domain and amino acid residues shown to play a critical role in NP anti-IFN-I activity have been recently shown to mediate inhibition of nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity of nuclear Factor Kappa B (NF-B) results 2.1. Identification of a Specific Amino Acid Residue with Critical Role in LCMV-NP Self-association. NP oligomerization likely plays a major role in the encapsidation of viral RNA and in the formation, together with L, of vRNPs that direct both replication and transcription of the viral genome. cell lysates were prepared and analyzed by Western blot. NP mutant Q362R was expressed at similar levels as wt NP. D471G and D471G/Q362R NP mutants were expressed at slightly lower levels. 1G and the double mutant Q362R/D471G were severely impaired in their ability to interact with wt LCMV-NP. all VP16 fusion constructs were expressed at similar levels as determined by an anti-VP16 polyclonal antibody. these results uncovered a key role of residue D471 in NP-NP interaction. expression plasmids, 2 g of LCMV-NP-GAL4 expression plasmid, 1 g of the pRL SV40 expression plasmid, and 0.1 g of the pRL SV40 expression plasmid. at 72 hpt, GFP expression was assessed using fluorescence microscopy and cell extracts were prepared to determine the strength of NP-NP interaction. the LCMV-NP domain involved in the interaction with Z was mapped to the C-terminal of viral NP [33] to further characterize the NP-Z interaction, we performed a M2H assay. a FLAG-tagged LCMV-Z pC expression plasmid was co-transfected in 293T cells alone. mutants tested interacted at similar levels with Z as determined by GFP. all NP-VP16 fusion proteins were expressed at similar levels as determined by WB. LCMV-NP residue D471 does not play a critical role in NP-Z interaction. at 72 hpt, LCMV NP-Z interaction was determined by GFP expression (i) and luciferase activity (ii) pC-VP16 expression plasmid was used as negative control. expression levels of wt and mutant NP were determined by WB. reporter gene expressions were assessed by fluorescence microscopy. NP mutants containing the D471G substitution failed in their ability to replicate and transcribe the LCMV MG. NP containing substitution Q362R showed a minimal defect on replication and transcription. NP-self-association was mapped to the C-terminal region of the viral protein [28]. NP self-association was mapped to an N-terminal region of NP that did not overlap with the anti-IFN-I domain. to that end, we analyzed whether substitution D471G that disrupted NP-NP association affected also the anti-IFN-I activity of NP. wt and all NP mutants tested similarly counteracted seV-mediated induction of IFN. self-association of LCMV-NP is not required for counteracting the IFN-I response. one interaction involves mainly a region located at the N-terminal region of NP. the other interaction involves an RNA-independent head-to-tail protein-protein interaction involving both the N- and C-terminal regions of NP [29,37]. this model would predict that NP-NP interaction mediated by the C-terminal domain of NP could be separated from the ability of NP to bind RNA. human 293T cells were co-transfected with 2.5 g of the indicated pC-LCMV-NP wt or amino acid mutants HA-tagged. at 48 hpt, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for NP expression levels by WB using an anti-HA antibody (A) NP and NP-Z interactions, as well as NP functions in replication and transcription of the LCMV MG and the ability of NP to counteract seV-mediated induction of the host IFN-I response. change D to A at position 471 may have affected the overall structure of NP without affecting its stability. gene activation (FFL) is shown as percentage of wt interaction (pC-NP-VP16 and pC-GAL4-Z) after normalization of transfection efficiencies. cell lysates were used to detect expression of wt and mutant NPs by WB using an anti-VP16 polyclonal antibody. expression of wt and mutant NPs were determined by WB using an anti-HA antibody. LCMV-NP D471G was not able to promote replication and expression of the LCMV MG. this would predict a dominant negative phenotype in the LCMV MG rescue assay. BHK-21 cells were co-transfected in triplicate with 0.5 g of pPolI GFP-Pur/Gluc, 0.6 g of pC-L, and the indicated amounts (ng) of pC-LCMV-NP HA-tagged (NP); together with empty pC (Empty) or pC LCMV-NP D471G HA-tagged (D471G), and 0.1g of the pSV40-C parental and NP-HA expressing BHK-21 cell lines were infected with LCMV (moi = 0.01) or VSV-GFP (moi = 0.001) in triplicates. TCS at indicated hpi were titrated using a focus forming unit assay on vero cells. NP oligomerization likely plays a major role in the encapsidation of viral RNA and in the formation, together with L, of vRNPs that direct both replication and transcription of the viral genome [23,24]. to identify single amino acid residues involved in self-association of LCMV-NP, we screened a previously documented battery of LCMV-NP mutants for their self-association properties. mutant lysates were incubated with anti-FLAG affinity agarose gel and immunoprecipitates analyzed by WB using anti-HA or anti-FLAG antibodies. band intensities were quantified and normalized with respect to total NP expression. to confirm and further characterize the effect of D471G substitution in NP-NP interaction, we used the M2H system. LCMV-NP tagged versions were expressed individually together with 2 g of empty pC to keep constant the total amount of transfected DNA. at 48 hpt, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for protein expression levels by WB using anti-HA or anti-FLAG polyclonal antibodies (i) pRL SV40 expression plasmid normalized transfection efficiencies with pRL SV40. at 72 hpt, GFP expression was assessed using fluorescence microscopy. cells were transfected with pC-NP-GAL4 together with pC-VP16. in the NP-Z interaction, we examined its interaction with Z using both VLP and M2H assays. a FLAG-tagged LCMV-Z pC expression plasmid was co-transfected in 293T cells alone or in combination with pC expression plasmids of wt or mutant NPs. all samples expressed similar levels LCMV-NP and LCMV-Z proteins (Figure 2A, i) LCMV-NP residue D471 does not play a critical role in NP-Z interaction. human 293T cells were co-transfected with 2 g of the indicated pC wt or mutant NPs HA-tagged, together with 2 g of pC-LCMV-Z FLAG-tagged expression plasmid. d was used as negative control after normalization of transfection efficiencies. expression levels of wt and mutant NP were determined by WB using an anti-VP16 polyclonal antibody (iii) d was used as a loading control. NP mutants containing the substitution failed in their ability to replicate and transcribe the LCMV MG. NP containing substitution Q362R showed a minimal defect on replication and transcription. the total absence of reporter gene expression associated with substitution D471G could not be attributed to the modest differences in protein expression levels observed by WB. anti-IFN-I activity of arenavirus NP was mapped to the C-terminal region of the viral protein [28]. NP self-association was mapped to an N-terminal region of NP that did not overlap with the anti-IFN-I domain. to that end, we co-transfected 293T cells with pIFN-GFP and pIFN-FFL [25] reporter plasmids. human 293T cells were co-transfected with 0.5 g of each of the IFN reporter plasmids (pIFN-GFP and pIFN-FFL), 0.1 g of the indicated pC-NP HA-tagged expression vector and 0.1 g of pRL SV40 expression plasmid. at 16 hpt, cells were mock infected or infected with SeV (moi=3) to induce activation of the IFN interaction mediated by the C-terminal domain of NP could be separated from the ability of NP to bind RNA. as a control, we included LCMV-Z, which was predicted to not bind RNA. for this, we co-transfected 293T cells with the indicated pC-NP or pC-Z HA-tagged expression plasmids. at 48 hpt, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for NP expression levels by WB using an anti-HA antibody (A) cell lysates were used in pull-down assays with poly I:C bound to sepharose beads. numbers at the bottom of each WB lane represent the quantification of band intensities normalized to wt NP lane. human 293T cells were co-transfected with 2 g of the indicated pC wt or mutant NP-VP16 fusion proteins. at 72 hpt, cell extracts were prepared to determine the strength of the interaction. reporter gene activation (FFL) is shown as percentage of wt interaction (pC-NP-VP16 and pC-NP-GAL4) after normalization of transfection efficiencies based on levels of Renilla lucifera lysates were used to detect expression of wt and mutant NPs by WB using an anti-HA antibody. expression levels of wt and mutant NPs were determined by WB using an anti-HA antibody. LCMV-NP D471G was not able to promote replication and expression of the LCMV MG. however, NP D471G may potentially keep its interaction with the viral RNA. this would predict a dominant negative phenotype of NP D471G. MG activity was determined by GFP expression (A) and luciferase activity from TCS (B) at 48 hpt, MG activity was determined by GFP expression (A) and pC LCMV-NP D471G HA-tagged (D471G), and 0.1g of the pSV40-Cluc expression vector to normalize transfection efficiencies. the observed dominant negative effect on the replication and transcription in the MG assay led us to hypothe NP D471G NP has specific effect on LCMV viral proliferation. parental and NP-HA expressing BHK-21 cell lines infected with LCMV (moi = 0.01) or VSV-GFP (moi = 0.001) in triplicates. LCMV (Armstrong strain, ARM53b) was produced by infecting BHK-21 cells (moi = 0.01) and harvesting the TCS at 72 hours post-infection (hpi). LCMV-NP single amino acid mutants (Q362R, D471G, D471E, and D471A) and the double mutant (Q362R and D471A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis and then sub-clone pPolI GPC/Pur-GFP was amplified by PCR from the p18Kprom-Puro-EGFP plasmid. pPolI GPC/Pur-GFP and pPolI Gluc/NP were cloned into the LCMV S segment backbone pPolI BsmBI/NP plasmid. both plasmids (pPolI GPC/Pur-GFP and p cipitation (Co-IP) Human 293T (3 x 106 cells) were co-transfected in suspension (6-well tissue culture plates format) with 4 g total of HA- and FLAG-tagged NP pC expression plasmids. at 48 hours post-transfection, cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 30 minutes (min) at 4\u00b0C. human 293T cells were co-transfected in suspension (6-well plate format, 3 x 106 cells/well) with 2 g of the pC-Z-FLAG expression plasmid and 2 g of wild type (wt) or mutant LCMV-NP expression plasmids. at 72 hpt, cells and TCS were collected. pPolI Gluc/Pur-GFP indicated amounts of pC-LCMV-NP HA-tagged. 0.1 g of a mammalian expression vector encoding the secreted Cypridina luciferase (Cluc) under the control of the Simian Virus 40 (SV40) constitutive promoter (pSV40-Cluc, new England Biolabs) a RL expression plasmid under the control of the SV40 promoter (pRL SV40, Promega) was used to normalize transfection efficiencies. at 72 hpt, representative fluorescence images were obtained to evaluate protein-protein interaction by GFP expression using a Zeiss fluorescent microscope. poly I:C sepharose beads (50 l) were pre-incubated for 10 min with lysis buffer at room temperature and used to pull-down 100 l (25 % of total cell lysates) of cleared lysates overnight at 4 \u00b0C. sepharose beads were washed four times with 500 l of lysis buffer. protein expression was determined by WB as previously described [33]. mean value and standard deviation were calculated using Microsoft Excel software. proteins were separated by 7.5 % or 12 % SDS-PAGE. cells were co-transfected with pC-LCMV-NP wt or D471G HA-tagged. cells were plated into 10-cm dishes at low density. clones were selected in presence of 2.5 g/ml of puromycin. LCMV-NP positive cells were identified by staining with an anti-NP mAb (1.1.3) and a 1:200 dilution in 2.5 % BSA of a fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody. at 12 hpi, VSV-GFP infected cells were determined by GFP expression and counted under a fluorescent microscopy. LCMV (Armstrong strain, ARM53b) was produced by infecting BHK-21 cells (moi = 0.01) and harvesting the TCS at 48 hpi. LCMV-NP single amino acid mutants (Q362R, D471G, D471E, and D471A) and the double mutant (Q362R and D471A) were generated by site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and then sub-clone a fusion construct of Puromycin (Pur) and Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) was amplified by PCR from the p18Kprom-Puro-EGFP plasmid. both plasmids (pPolI GPC/Pur-GFP and pPolI Gluc/NP) were then combined using BglII restriction sites to generate the pPolI Gluc/NP. co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) Human 293T were co-transfected with 4 g total of NP pC expression plasmids using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) at 48 hours post-transfection, cells were collected by centrifugation at 1,000 rpm for 30 minutes (min) at 4\u00b0C and lysed with 400 l of lysis buffer. cyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) loading buffer was analyzed by WB. aliquots (20 l; 5 % of total cell lysates) from each sample were analyzed by WB. assay BHK-21 cells (2 x 105) were co-transfected in monolayer (12-well plate format, triplicates) with 0.6 g of pC-L, 0.5 g of the dual LCMV MG reporter plasmid pPolI Gluc/Pur-GFP. 0.1 g of a mammalian expression vector encoding the secreted Cypridina luciferase (Cluc) under the control of the Sim plasmids indicated pC-VP16 and GAL4 expression plasmids, 1 g of the reporter pG5 GFP/FFL plasmid, and 0.1 g of a Renilla luciferase (RL) expression plasmid under the control of the SV40 promoter. at 72 hpt, representative fluorescence images were obtained to evaluate protein-protein interaction by GFP expression using a Zeiss fluorescent microscope sRNA binding, polyinosine-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C, Sigma) was bound to CNBr-activated sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare) following manufacturer\u2019s recommendation. sepharose beads were washed four times with 500 l of lysis buffer. a 25 l aliquot of each pull-down sample was analyzed by WB. luciferase kit (Promega) was recommended by manufacturer. protein expression was determined by WB as previously described. protein band intensities were quantified using imageJ software. wt LCMV-NP mutants expressions were normalized by their relative intensity to wt LCMV-NP. BHK-21 cells were co-transfected with pC-LCMV-NP wt or D471G HA-tagged. clones were selected in presence of 2.5 g/ml of puromycin. s were washed twice with PBS, and maintained in post-infection media. at indicated times post-infection, TCS were collected, clarified by centrifugation, and titrated. LCMV-NP positive cells were identified by staining with an anti-NP mAb. negative strand RNA viruses have been shown to be required for the formation of functional vRNP that directs replication and transcription of the viral genome. we have strongly suggested the role of the residue D471 in the self-association of NP from the prototypic arenavirus LCMV. the mutant was not affected in its ability to interact with Z, counteract the SeV induced IFN-I response or bind to dsRNA analogs. NP sequence alignment from representative members of the Arenaviridae family shows the highly conserved nature of the D471 residue. it has been suggested that LASV-NP has a possible gating mechanism that allows protein structural rearrangement upon RNA binding. EMBL-EBI CLUSTALW 2.0.8 multiple sequence alignment program was used for alignment. n-terminal deletion mutants of NP retained the ability to counteract the IFN-I response. mutations in amino acids predicted to be in the NP-NP interface have been described to corroborate its effect on replication and transcription function. NP-mediated encapsidation of arenavirus genome and antigenome RNA species, which involves NP-RNA interaction, is strictly required for replication and gene expression of viral genome. NP discriminates between viral from cellular RNA in virus-infected cells. structural features of RNA substrate recognized by NP to mediate encapsidation have not been defined. arenaviruses exhibit sequence complementarity between the 5\u2019-and 3\u2019-termini of their genomes and antigenomes. this is predicted to result in the formation of a panhandle structure. NP (D471G) has the ability to interact with the Z protein and thereby compete with the Z-vRNP interaction required for production of matured infectious virions. mutations affecting NP-NP interaction have been documented to exhibit dominant negative phenotypes."}
