{"summary": "the development of antiviral agents targeting virus-encoded enzymes has achieved great success in the last few decades. however, the antiviral activity of these direct-acting antiviral agents is usually virus specific, and treatment failure occurs due to the emergence of drug-resistant viruses. targeting host functions essential for viral replication should have a much higher genetic barrier for drug resistance and may inhibit all the viruses that depend on the targeted host function. iminosugars disrupt the glycan processing of viral envelope proteins. antiviral activities of several iminosugar compounds against dengue virus (DENV) (14\u201319), japan encephalitis virus (JEV) (20), EBOV (20) and marburg virus (21) have been demonstrated in mice. iminosugar treatment altered the glycan structure of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the cellular receptor of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63 (24, 25). ACE2 does not affect its cell surface expression or binding to SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein, but impairs the viral envelope spike glycoprotein-triggered membrane fusion. clonal antibody against the myc epitope was obtained from Pierce. Plasmids expressing VSV G protein, Lassa fever virus glycoprotein (GP), Ebola virus envelope glycoprotein, NL63 spike glycoprotein, H1N1 influenza A virus (A/WSN/33) hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) were described previously. cDNA-integrated cells were selected with 250 g/ml hygromycin and 5 g/ml blasticidin. two weeks later, separate colonies appeared, and the pool of such cells was expanded to generate a cell line, designated FLP-IN/ACE2. expression of human ACE2 by the cell line was confirmed by Western blotting with an antibody against the myc tag. luciferase signals yielded luciferase signals of 10,000 to 1,000,000 light units per well. cells were lysed with 20 l/well of cell lysis buffer (Promega) for 15 min. ACE2 protein was immunoprecipitated with a monoclonal antibody against the myc epitope. the gel plugs were washed in acetonitrile, followed by steps of 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile. the gel plug was then covered with the same solution and allowed to incubate overnight at 37\u00b0C. the mobile phase consisted of solvent A (50 mM ammonium formate, pH 4.4) and solvent B (acetonitrile), followed by a linear gradient from 20% to 58% solvent A for the next 3 min. the flow rate was increased to 1.0 ml/minute and the column washed in 100% solvent A for 5 min. 293T cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with either pcDNA5/RFT/ACE2 or pSARS-S. the mixed cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 4 105 cells per well. after another 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, cells were lysed with cell lysis buffer. the human hepatoma cell line Huh7.5 was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin G, streptomycin, nonessential amino acids, and 2 mM l-glutamine. a polyclonal antibody against human ACE2 was purchased from Pierce. a myc tag was added to the N terminus of ACE2 by PCR. a plasmid encoding a fusion protein of the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein (amino acids [aa] 318 to 510) and the human immunoglobulin (Ig) Fc fragment was described previously. 2 106 Lenti-X 293T cells were seeded into a 100-mm-diameter dish 1 day prior to transfection. cells were cotransfected with 20 g of pNL4.3.Luc.RE and 10 g of plasmid expressing a virus envelope protein. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were replenished with complete DMEM. cell monolayers were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and lysed with 1 Laemmli buffer. aliquot of cell lysate was separated in NuPAGE Novex 4 to 12% Bis-Tris gel (Invitrogen) membranes were blocked with phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk. the gel plugs were washed in acetonitrile, followed by steps of 20 mM ammonium bicarbonate and acetonitrile. the gel plug was then covered with the same solution and allowed to incubate overnight at 37\u00b0C. the glycans were eluted from the gel plug by sonication in milli-Q water three times. Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a Beckman Coulter FC500 cytofluorometer. 293T cells seeded in 6-well plates were transfected with either pcDNA5/RFT/ACE2 or pSARS-S by using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) the mixed cells were seeded into 12-well plates at a density of 4 105 cells per well. after another 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, syncytium formation was inspected. the cells were then infected with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with envelope proteins of seven different viruses. treatment with any of the four iminosugar compounds did not apparently inhibit the transduction of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with HCV envelope proteins. however, the four iminosugar compounds significantly inhibited the transduction of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with HCV envelope proteins. iminosugars selectively inhibited the infectious entry mediated by the envelope proteins of SARS-CoV and IAV. the compounds selectively inhibited the infectious entry mediated by the envelope proteins of the two human coronaviruses. infection of the two viruses demonstrated differential endosomal pH and cathepsin L dependences (37, 38), suggesting that their post-receptor-binding entry events are differentially regulated. if iminosugar inhibition of SARS-CoV spike protein-mediated entry is due to the alteration of ACE2 glycan structure, we anticipated that the compounds might also inhibit HCoV-NL63 spike protein-mediated entry. a time-of-addition experiment was performed to determine the minimum times of iminosugar treatment sufficient to suppress the transduction of pseudoviral particles. the cells were cultured with complete DMEM after two washes with DMEM. IHVR-17028 treatment dose-dependently inhibited transduction of ACE2-expressing 293 cells by SARS-CoVpp and HCoV-NL63pp but not VSVpp. however, expression of ACE2 did not affect transduction of VSVpp. FLP-IN/ACE2 cells were cultured with tetracycline for 48 h. luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined at 72 h postinfection. luciferase activity normalized to that of mock-treated cells. treatment with endo--N-acetylglucosaminidase H (endo H) failed to remove the glycans of ACE2. results thus imply that the iminosugar-induced ACE2 electrophoresis shift is due solely to the alteration of its N-linked glycans, not the polypeptide. glycan analysis was performed on ACE2 glycoprotein following resolution of protein by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. each ACE2 band was excised from the gel and the N-linked glycans analyzed by normal-phase HPLC. peak identification was made through sequential exoglycosidase digestion. complex glycans can be observed in the presence of the glucosidase inhibitors through the action of the Golgi endomannosidase. ACE2 protein was purified by protein A/G beads conjugated with polyclonal anti-ACE2 antibody. the peak labeled A2G2 is a core fucosylated biantennary glycan with terminal galactose residues. iminosugar treatment does not alter ACE2 cell surface expression and binding to SARS-CoV spike protein. a flow cytometry analysis of intact FLP-IN/ACE2 cells showed that the iminosugar treatment did not affect the amount of ACE2 protein expressed on the plasma membrane. the results showed that IHVR-17028 treatment did not inhibit the fusion protein from binding ACE2-expressing cells. the results showed that iminosugar suppression of SARS-CoV spike protein-mediated infectious entry is most likely not due to the inhibition of ACE2 expression on the cell surface or impairment of its ability to bind the virus. 293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding either SARS-CoV S protein or ACE2 were mock treated or treated with 50 M IHVR-17028 for 48 h. for syncytium formation, the cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and cultured for 24 h. the transfected cells were mock treated or treated with IHVR-17028 for 48 h. the cells were then mixed at a 1:1 ratio and cultured for 24 h. the extent of cell fusion between the ACE2- and spike protein-expressing cells can be quantified by measuring luciferase activity. Huh7.5 cells were treated for 3 days with a panel of four 1-deoxynojirimycin derivatives that have been shown previously to inhibit ER glucosidases with different potencies. the cells were then infected with lentiviral particles pseudotyped with envelope proteins of seven different viruses. treatment with any of the four iminosugar compounds did not apparently inhibit the transduction of lentiviral particles pseudotyped with HCV envelope proteins. the 50% cytotoxic concentrations (CC50) of the compounds are >500 M in Huh7.5 cells. the compounds selectively inhibited the infectious entry mediated by the envelope proteins of SARS-CoV and IAV, but not those of the other five viruses tested. HCoV-NL63, a group I human coronavirus that causes the common cold, also uses ACE2 as its receptor (25) the receptor binding domains of the spike proteins of the two human coronaviruses have no structural homology. however, infection of the two viruses demonstrated differential endosomal pH and cathepsin L dependences. efficiency represents the luciferase activity normalized to that of mock-treated cells. luciferase activities in cell lysates were determined at 72 h postinfection. differences in SARS-CoVpp, HCoV-NL63pp, or IAVpp transduction efficiency are statistically significant. 293 cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 1 g/ml of tetracycline. the cells were cultured in the absence or presence of 1 g/ml of tetracycline for 24 h. expression of ACE2 did not affect transduction of VSVpp. FLP-IN/ACE2 cells were cultured in complete DMEM with or without tetracycline for 24 h followed by infection with the indicated pseudotyped lentiviral particles. luciferase activity in cell lysates was determined at 72 h postinfection. IHVR-17028 cells cultured in absence or presence of IHVR-17028 with PNGase F, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high-mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins. ACE2 electrophoresis mobility shift is due solely to the alteration of its N-linked glycans, not the polypeptide ACE2 in cell lysates was purified by using protein A/G beads coated with an ACE2 polyclonal antibody. purified ACE2 was digested by PNGase or endo H and detected by a Western blot assay. nary glycans had an overall decrease in the level of sialylation. this result explains the increased electrophoretic mobility of ACE2 proteins from iminosugar-treated cells. this result is consistent with the endo H digestion result shown in Fig. 4C. sialylated versions of these structures are indicated as S1, containing a single sialic acid, or S2, containing two sialic acid molecules. all peaks were identified by sequential exoglycosidase digestion. representative results from two independent experiments are presented. rant oligosaccharides of ACE2 from IHVR-17028-treated cells impaired the ability of the receptor molecule to bind a fusion protein that has the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS spike protein fused to the N terminus of the IgG Fc fragment. results showed that IHVR-17028 treatment did not inhibit the fusion protein from binding ACE2-expressing cells. syncytium formation was inhibited by iminosugar treatment. 293T cells transfected with plasmids encoding either ACE2 or SARS-CoV spike protein were mock treated or treated with 50 M IHVR-17028 for 48 h. for syncytium formation, cells were mixed at a 1:1 ratio and cultured for 24 h. 293T cells were cotransfected with either plasmids encoding ACE2 and T7 polymerase or plasmids expressing SARS-CoV spike protein and firefly luciferase under the control of the T7 promoter (pT7/Luc) the transfected cells were mock treated or treated with IHVR-17028 for 48 h. the cells were then mixed at a 1:1 ratio and cultured for 24 h. inhibition of host cellular functions required for viral replication is an ideal approach for the development of broad-spectrum antiviral agents. ER glucosidase inhibitors prevent the removal of terminal glucose moieties on N-linked glycans. inhibition of ER glucosidase I and/or II prevents the removal of the terminal glucose moieties on N-linked glycans. infectivity of viral particles secreted from iminosugar-treated cells is generally reduced (51\u201353) for most enveloped viruses investigated, reductions in virion secretion and infectivity are responsible for the overall antiviral effects of iminosugars. the paramount concern is the toxicity underlying the \u201con-target\u201d suppression of host functions required for viral replication. iminosugar-treated cells can be processed through an alternative pathway that trims the N-linked glycans by cleaving the oligosaccharide chains between the internal mannose moieties by Golgi endomannosidases (39\u201341). the resulting N-linked glycans are further processed and matured into complex glycans in the Golgi apparatus. a possible scenario is that alteration of ACE2 N-linked glycans compromises its dynamic interaction with viral envelope glycoproteins during membrane fusion. alteration of N-linked glycans may disrupt ACE2 interaction with another cellular component(s) that facilitates the membrane fusion between virus and host cells. this differential effect of IHVR-17028 on SARS-CoV and CoV-NL63 glycoprotein-mediated infectious entry is most likely because one or multiple post- ER glucosidase inhibitors are the ideal antiviral agents for treatment of acute viral infections, particularly viral hemorrhagic fevers and severe respiratory tract viral infections. both viral hemorrhagic fevers and severe respiratory tract viral infections are sometimes life-threatening and have a short time window."}
