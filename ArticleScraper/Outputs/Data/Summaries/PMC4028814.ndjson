{"summary": "national trends in seasonal influenza vaccine (IV) coverage in Portugal from 1998/99 to 2010/11. a meta-regression model was adjusted for IV coverage in the general population and in the age groups. there was no trend in coverage until 2008/09. the major pandemic threats of the past decade had a modest but significant effect on seasonal influenza vaccination. there was an increase in vaccine uptake proportion in the general population in 2003/04 and 2005/06, and in individuals 15 years old in 2009/10. the pandemic led to reinforcement of influenza vaccination recommendations in european countries, including Portugal. in 2005, the world health organization (WHO) declared that the emergence and persistence of influenza A (H5N1) in birds and the associated human fatalities were a public health threat. in April 2009, the spread of novel swine flu origin influenza A (H1N1) prompted the declaration of a pandemic by WHO in June of the same year [9]. each flu season, the main objective of the DGS has been to increase IV coverage in high risk groups. pregnant women Homeless Healthcare workers Contacts of persons at high risk 2005/06 Elderly Residents of institutions for the elderly and the disabled Individuals (>6 months) with chronic diseases and high-risk conditions. pregnant women Healthcare workers Contacts of persons at high risk Women in the 2nd and 3rd trimester of pregnancy Professionals that may be involved in culling poultry infected with influenza virus 2006/07 Elderly Residents of institutions for the elderly and the disabled Individuals (>6 months) with chronic diseases and high-risk in 2009/10, a specific recommendation for vaccination against pandemic influenza virus A (H1N1) 2009 was also issued. in 2004, WHO established a 75% IV coverage target in the elderly (>65 years) that was in effect until 2010 [12] in 2006, the DGS established an interim target of 50% vaccine coverage among individuals aged 65 years and over for the 2006/07 season [14]. the ECOS panel consisted of a random sample of Portuguese families with a landline telephone and of families with landline and mobile phone since the 2009/10 sample (dual sample frame) the sample was stratified and evenly distributed to represent the five health regions of the country.

Portugal ranked thirteenth for IV coverage in the elderly (65 years) in 2006/07 season. this was similar to the overall estimate for all countries (53.2%) in 2006/07 season. in 2009/2010, the declaration of a worldwide influenza pandemic by WHO focused the attention of the media on influenza. in the general population, influenza coverage was significantly greater in two seasons, 2003/2004 (p = 0.032) and 2005/2006 (p = 0.018). the seasonal influenza coverage in the general population during the 2009/2010 season was not significantly greater. ECOS is a sample of families from mainland Portugal, with landline and mobile telephones, who agree to complete periodic health surveys. residents of Portugal who do not have a landline or mobile telephone were not represented in this study. seasonal IV coverage in Portugal varied between 14.2% and 17.5%. coverage increased from 31.3% in 1998/99 to 48.3% in 2010/11."}
