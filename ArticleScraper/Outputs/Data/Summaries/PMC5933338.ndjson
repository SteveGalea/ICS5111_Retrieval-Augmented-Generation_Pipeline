{"summary": "symmetric dimeric adamantane derivatives were synthesized where two amantadine or rimantadine molecules were linked by various alkyl-spacer lengths. the inhibitory activity of the compounds was studied on two viroporins: the influenza virus M2 protein, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. adamantanes can be considered a prospective class of p7 inhibitors. they are small virus-encoded proteins that are able to permeabilize membranes for ions and small molecules. this family includes M2,3 Vpu,4 the E-protein channels of coronaviruses,5 and the p7 ion channel of hepatitis C virus. administration-approved drugs for treatment of influenza infections. these compounds inhibit the M2 protein by blocking its proton conductance. adamantane-based compounds can block HCV p7 ion-channel activity17\u201319. p7 is a 63-residue protein with two TM domains (TMDs) that are separated by a short hydrophilic cytosolic loop. the p7 protomer is able to oligomerize to hexameric21,24 and heptameric complexes,17 forming an ion channel. dimeric amantadines and rimantadines should not be able to fit in the channel and have no channel inhibition. the structure of p7 protein suggests the presence of several identical adamantane-binding pockets where six adamantane molecules are required to inhibit one molecule. this suggests the presence of several identical adamantane-binding pockets where six adamantane molecules are required to inhibit one molecule. carbon chemical shifts referenced to CDCl3 or methanol-d4. electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry was determined on an Agilent 1100 liquid-chromatography MS system in a positive mode. 1H NMR (CD3OD, 400 MHz) (ppm) 1.61\u20131.67 (m, 6H, 4,6,10-adamantane H), 1.96 (d, J=2.4 Hz, 6H, 6,9,8-adamantane H), 1.99 (br s, 3H, 3,5,7-adamantane H), 2.52 (br s, 2H, H-b), 13C NMR (CD3OD, 100 N,N\u2032-bis-(adamantan-1-yl) suberic acid diamide (1c) Compound 1c (330 mg, 54%) was obtained as a white solid;

comparable potency in GTs 1a, 1b, 3a, and 4a. no dependence between the p7-inhibitory activity of the dimeric compounds and alkyl-spacer length. all dimeric compounds showed relatively similar potency in the tested GTs, suggesting that all these compounds have a similar binding mode. the shortest spacer cannot span this distance and therefore cannot bind in the neighboring adamantane-binding site located in the adjacent monomer. the first adamantane ring in the dimeric compound 2a showed a similar binding mode as amantadine, while the second adamantane appeared protruding to another cavity. future site-directed mutagenesis would be needed to confirm unambiguously the binding mode suggested by our docking studies. a proline residue in a TM helix typically changes the orientation of the helix, causing a kink or even breaking the helix. this common behavior results from its inability to act as a hydrogen-bond donor (tertiary amide) and steric interferences of its cyclic side chain with residues. the target dimeric compounds 2a\u2013e and rimantadines 4a\u2013e were prepared in a two-step approach involving diamide formation with dicarboxylic acids HO2C-(CH2)n-CO2H. the dicarboxylic acids were converted to the corresponding acid chlorides using oxalyl chloride. the crude acid chlorides (1.4 mmol) were reacted with an excess of amantadine (4 mmol) to butyric acid was coupled to rimantadine followed by amide reduction using borane\u2013THF complex in dry THF, reflux 9 hours. inhibitory activity of dimeric adamantane compounds on wild-type (A) and S31N mutant (B) M2 proteins measured using two-electrode voltage-clamp technique at 100 M concentration. amantadine binds to the M2-WT channel with its positively charged ammonium facing the C-termini of the channel. a secondary hydrophobic adamantane cage introduced in their structure will not be expected to fit in the M2-WT channel. all the dimeric compounds showed lower inhibitory activity compared to amantadine. this could be explained by the dimeric compounds lacking the adamantane-NH2+-CH2-aryl pharmacophore of M2-S31N inhibitors. rimantadine and amantadine are known inhibitors of p7 activity, blocking lysosomal deacidification and lowering p7 currents in patch-clamp measurements. the dimeric adamantanes showed similar potency to their respective monomeric analogs in GTs 1a, 1b, and 4a. 1.2 (8) 244

where amantadine could not inhibit p7 ion-channel activity. lack of proline in GTs 2a and 3a could affect the kink angle of TMD2. p7-inhibitory activity could be attributed to better fitting in this large adamantane pocket or simultaneous binding of the two adamantane rings. M2-inhibitory activities of dimeric adamantane compounds were detrimental to blocking of M2 ion-channel activity. ion channel of limited pore size with its N-terminal end constricted by a hydrophobic Val27 valve. amantadine binds to the M2-WT channel with its positively charged ammonium facing the C-termini of the channel. a secondary hydrophobic adamantane cage introduced in their structure will not be expected to fit in the M2-WT channel. this suggests bulky substitutions on the amine group will not be tolerated. all the dimeric compounds showed lower inhibitory activity compared to amantadine. this could be explained by the dimeric compounds lacking the adamantane-NH2+-CH2-aryl pharmacophore of M2-S31N inhibitors. p7-inhibitory activity was tested on p7 channels for GTs 1a, 1b, 2a, 3a, and 4a. rimantadine and amantadine are known inhibitors of p7 activity. the dimeric adamantanes showed similar potency to monomeric analogs. tadine 0.70.1 (5) 1.71.2 (8) 244 (5) 1.60.6 (5) 3.00.8 (4) 2a 0.40.1 (5) 1.20.2 (3) 2.80.3 (4) 2.00.4 (4) 1.20.2 (4) 2b 0.40.1 (4) 0.50.4 (3) 0.90.1 (3) 0.90.3 (4) 0.40.1 (5) 2c 1.00.2 (7) 0.70.2 (4) 0.80.1 (6) 0.60.1 (9) 0.80.1 (7) 2d 0.90.1 (3) two homology models were previously constructed37 using the NMR structure of HCV p7 GT5a (PDB 2M6X)26 as a template for model 1 and the NMR/MD structure of the monomeric form of GT1b as a template for model 2.38. the distance between the C atoms of Leu20 in two adjacent adamantane-binding sites to be 11 and 17 respectively. sequence alignment of p7 protein in GT5a and the five GTs under study. sensitivity of p7 to multiple inhibitors was previously reported. amantadine could not inhibit p7 ion-channel activity in GTs 2a and 3a,17,19. the lack of proline in GTs 2a and 3a could affect the kink angle of TMD2. this could explain the low inhibitory activity of amantadine. our dimeric compounds could overcome amantadine\u2019s resistance. dimers need to have adamantane-NH2+-CH2-aryl pharmacophore and bind to the M2-S31N channel with their aryl group facing the N-terminal Val27. dimeric analogs were equipotent to monomeric reference ligands when tested on HCV GTs 1a, 1b, and 4a."}
