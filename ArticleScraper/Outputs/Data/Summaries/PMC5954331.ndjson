{"summary": "despite improvements in lung function and nutritional outcomes for individuals with cystic fibrosis (CF) over the past decade, pulmonary exacerbation (PEx) remains common. in 2016, one in three patients required at least one course of intravenous (IV) antibiotics to treat a PEx 1. a consensus definition of what constitutes a PEx is likely to remain elusive without a gold standard. some recent pediatric trials have used the PEx definition employed in the early Pseudomonas infection control trial. this definition should be independent of the physician\u2019s decision to treat and pulmonary function testing limits the age range of patients assessed. symptoms and lung function for early PEx detection confirmed a change in symptoms at least 4 weeks prior to PEx diagnosis in most patients, and further symptom deterioration in the 2 weeks prior to PEx diagnosis 6. however, an earlier diagnosis led to more frequent use of oral (versus IV) antibiotics compared with the usual-care arm (67% versus 43%). this might have resulted in a higher rate of non-recovery of FEV 1 % predicted to within 5% of baseline (4 the strongest risk factor for a PEx requiring IV antibiotics was the occurrence of a PEx requiring IV antibiotics in the preceding year 13. the strongest risk factor for a PEx requiring IV antibiotics was the occurrence of a PEx requiring IV antibiotics. 25% of patients who experience exacerbations fail to recover baseline lung function as defined by 90% of baseline within 3 months of treatment 2. factors independently associated with non-response included female sex; malnourishment; pancreatic insufficiency; persistent infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa; allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis. the proportion of patients requiring at least one course of IV antibiotics per year has not decreased significantly over the past decade 1. this appears to be driven by a lower threshold among clinicians to diagnose and treat PEx 8. a multi-center study in the uk showed higher IV antibiotic use among centers with higher baseline FEV 1 % predicted 10. nearly 20% of exacerbations treated with oral antibiotics did not recover to within 90% of baseline FEV 1 % predicted within 3 months of treatment 2. the greater the number of cumulative oral antibiotic-treated events over the study period, the steeper the rate of lung function decline. an improvement to 100% of baseline yields a non-response rate as high as 60% 16. most studies have used the best FEV 1 in the 3 months following the end of IV antibiotic treatment as the follow-up FEV 1. this leads to underestimation of treatment non-response. multiple studies have demonstrated no significant changes in bacterial density from stable to PEx state 25\u201328. CF airway infections are polymicrobial and interactions between these microbes may increase or decrease pathogenicity 31. patients with baseline FEV 1 of more than 50% predicted had a greater increase in FEV 1 % predicted from admission to day 28. patients with baseline FEV 1 of more than 50% predicted had a greater increase in FEV 1 % predicted from admission to day 28 than patients with baseline FEV 1 less than 50% predicted (10% versus 3%) a recent study found that symptom improvement in response to PEx treatment is poorly predictive of long-term response in terms of recovery of baseline lung function at 3 months or time to next IV antibiotics. however, immediate FEV 1 response was predictive of recovery of baseline FEV 1 by 3 months 39. a small randomized, two-factor, mixed-design comparative study involving 17 adults with CF has been performed. a larger RCT of the two treatment settings may not be generalizable and will be challenging to interpret because of lack of blinding, attrition bias, high rates of crossover. CF exacerbations are typically treated for 14 days. the mean duration of treatment was 15.9 (SD 6.0) days. 11% of patients received treatment for 10 days or less and 60% received treatment for more than 14 days. several adjunct therapies for the treatment of CF PEx have recently been evaluated or are currently under investigation. nebulized hypertonic saline is well established as a strategy for PEx prevention 48 but has only recently been studied as an adjunct during PEx treatment. a single-center study has set the stage for a larger multi-center placebo-controlled placebo-controlled RCT 52. systemic corticosteroids are used in up to 20% of CF exacerbations 35, 39. there is limited evidence to support their use 40. in 53% of exacerbations compared with improvement of symptoms in 43% of exacerbations 5. There is considerable variability as to what constitutes an acceptable threshold for FEV 1 improvement before antibiotics can be stopped. patients with baseline FEV 1 of more than 50% predicted had a greater increase in FEV 1 % predicted from admission to day 28 than patients with baseline FEV 1 less than 50% predicted (10% versus 3%) a recent study found that symptom improvement in response to PEx treatment is poorly predictive of long-term response in terms of recovery of baseline lung function at 3 months or time to next IV antibiotics. however, immediate FEV 1 response was predictive of recovery of baseline FEV 1 by 3 months 39. a small randomized, two-factor, mixed-design comparative study involving 17 adults with CF has been performed. the results of a larger RCT of the two treatment settings may not be generalizable and will be challenging to interpret because of lack of blinding, attrition bias. the benefits of inpatient PEx treatment are likely due to multiple factors other than the IV antibiotics alone. the decision should be made based on careful consideration of patient factors. CF exacerbations are typically treated for 14 days. several adjunct therapies for the treatment of CF PEx have recently been evaluated or are currently under investigation. nebulized hypertonic saline is well established as a strategy for PEx prevention 48, but it has only recently been studied as an adjunct during PEx treatment. ine group had a significant decrease in total and active sputum MMP-9 levels, improved protease-antiprotease imbalance in the airways, greater improvement in FEV 1 % predicted from admission. doxycycline has direct effects on dysregulated protease activity versus indirect effects due to changes in the microbiome. sputum biomarkers of inflammation, including interleukin-8 (IL-8), neutrophil elastase (NE), calprotectin, club cell secretory protein (CCSP) and MMP-9, have been investigated during PEx 56\u201359. the majority of biomarkers in relation to PEx have focused on inflammation in the sputum and blood 54, 55. a greater understanding of the sequence of events leading to a PEx at a molecular level is required to improve PEx outcomes. a greater understanding of the sequence of events leading to a PEx at a molecular level is required."}
