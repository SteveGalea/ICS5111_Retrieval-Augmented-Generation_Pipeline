{"summary": "the end TB strategy outlines an overall goal of 90% reduction in incidence and 95% reduction in mortality, compared with 2015 baseline. 10 million people (64% new cases) suffer from TB and 1.6 million people die of TB in 2017. mear-positive TB were achieved between 1990 and 2010, dramatically contributing to the realization of the stop TB strategy. however, china still ranks second among the 30 high TB-burden countries. a randomly selected 10% of isolates from each laboratory were required to be re-tested blindly by a superior laboratory. a patient with at least 2 positive sputum samples or 1 positive sputum sample and abnormal chest radiograph/1 positive sputum culture was diagnosed as smear-positive PTB. the one diagnosed with a recurrent episode of TB was relapsed case. the one who was diagnosed with a true relapse or a new episode of TB caused by reinfection was relapsed case. all the monitoring sites in the 6 cities were included. population data were collected from the Shandong Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. the diagnosis of smear-negative PTB predominantly relied on clinical symptoms (cough for >2 weeks, fever for >2 weeks, weight loss, hemoptysis, etc) all cases except those who have HIV co-infection were included in this study. new case was the one who had never been treated for TB or had taken anti-TB drugs for 1 month. 224,480 cases with PTB were identified in 6 cities of Shandong. the average age of these patients was 47.60 years with SD 19.62. only 2.48% patients aged 18 years. incidence rate From 2005 to 2017, the incidence rate of smear-positive PTB (33.23 to 6.41 per 100,000) and relapse cases (5.11 to 1.01 per 100,000) decreased by about 80%, and the incidence rate of overall PTB (40.80 to 26.39 per 100,000) declined by 35.31%. the joinpoint regression indicated an APC of 3.5% (P.05) during 2005\u20132008, 4.7% (P.05) during 2008 to 2013; and 7. the highest incidence rate grouping by age was 92.81 per 100,000 among patients aged >60 years in 2005. the largest decline in incidence grouping by geographical location occurred in Dezhou, dropped by 60.08% from 49.78 to 19.87 per 100,000. smallest decline in incidence grouping by geographical location occurred in Weifang, dropped by 12.17% from 28.9 to 25.39 per 100,000. averaged incidence of pulmonary tuberculosis in Shandong, china, 2005\u20132017. incidence rate of smear-positive PTB decreased by about 80%. incidence rate of overall PTB declined by 35.31%. the highest incidence rate grouping by age was 92.81 per 100,000 among patients aged >60 years in 2005. the highest incidence rate grouping by age was 92.81 per 100,000 among patients aged >60 years in 2005. the largest decline in incidence grouping by geographical location occurred in Dezhou, dropped by 60.08% from 49.78 to 19.87 per 100,000. the incidence of overall PTB decreased 35.31% in 13 years. this reduction can be directly linked to the decrease among smear-positive PTB. the disease burden gradually shifted from smear-positive PTB to smear-negative. smear-negative PTB account for 42% of PTB were less infectious, but still 20% of TB transmission was caused by these patients. the burden of new cases remains heavily heavily. new infection and new case of disease stand for the transmission of TB. in patients aged 60, about 90% of TB cases are due to reactivation of primary infection. the highest incidence rate grouping by age was 92.81 per 100,000 in 2005. the DOTS strategy does not specifically address reactivation disease in the short term seems to be limited. information was obtained from Information System for Disease Control and Prevention. the incidence of PTB in china decreased over the study periods. china has achieved the 2015 global TB control goal, but still a million incident TB cases are reported annually. writing \u2013 original draft: Ning-Ning Tao. writing \u2013 review and editing: Ning-Ning Tao."}
