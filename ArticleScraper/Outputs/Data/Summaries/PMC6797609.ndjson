{"summary": "RNAstasis is a central processing unit in the regulation of gene expression in eukaryotic cells. RNA stasis include synthesis, modification, protection, storage, release, transportation and degradation of different types of RNA (mRNA, tRNA, rRNA, siRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, piRNA, snoRNA, smRNA, smRNA) and metabolic processes mediated by RNA\u2013protein complexes called RNA gran mRNA granules are involved in mRNA triage and untranslated mRNA storage. a single mRNA can interact with both SGs and PBs. despite their distinctive organization and unique molecular markers, SGs and PBs could allow the dynamic shuttling of an mRNA between them. tree showing 56 sequences representing all viral families described to modulate RNA granules assembly. the chosen sequences were \u201cgene encoding to superficies structural protein\u201d the sequences were selected from NCBI databases. nunes et al. generated an electronic resource containing all SGs-recruited protein reported to date. most of these stresses are sensed by the eIF2 kinases PKR. most of these stresses are sensed by the eIF2 kinases PKR, which is activated by double-stranded RNA during viral infection. moto et al., 2014; Mahboubi and Stochaj, 2017; Stochaj, 2017; moto et al., 2014; moto et al., 2014; moto et al., 2014; moto et al., 2014; moto et al., 2014; moto et al., 2014; moto et al., 2014; moto et al., 2014; moto et al eIF2 kinases Stressors Poly I:C Induces SG assembly Induces HRI(Bortezomib)- and GCN2(MG132)-mediated eIF2 phosphorylation Mazroui et al., 2007; Fournier et al., 2010 Thapsigargin Induces SG assembly Prevents eIF2B inhibition, maintaining translation initiation. double-Stranded DNA (dsDNA) Viruses Herpesviridae All members of the Herpesviridae family that have been studied prevent the accumulation of SGs. phenotype could be due to reduced levels of late-expressed dsRNA binding protein Us11. dsRNA accumulates and partially localizes to vhs-induced SGs. authors suggest vhs-enhanced PKR activation is a consequence of SG assembly. HSV-2 impairs arsenite-induced SGs despite increased eIF2 phosphorylation, but not pateamine (eIF2-independent)-induced SGs. further investigation revealed that vhs localizes to SGs. TIA-1 was shown to egress before G3BP in the course of vhs-mediated SGs disassembly. both proteins have identical amino-terminal regions and share 35% of similarity in their carboxy-terminal regions. pTRS1 and pIRS1 have redundant roles in evading dsRNA-mediated antiviral response. pTRS1 PKR binding domain (PDB) is critical to accomplish those three phenotypes. the mechanism and the spatiotemporal regulation of SG assembly by the viral shutoff exonuclease SOX is unclear. expression of EBV protein EB2 does not abolish SG assembly. PKR/eIF2 phosphorylation indicates that this specific ability to regulate SGs is not conserved along herpesviruses. infection with the replication-defective VACV lacking E3L leads to the accumulation of granule-like structures around the RFs. AVGs contain proteins that are typically found in SGs such as TIA-1, eIF3b, G3BP-1, and USP10. in its absence these antiviral granules are not formed even if PKR and eIF2 are phosphorylated. E3L and C7L/K1L VACV induced-AVGs, infectivity neither assembly is blocked with E3L VACV in SAMD9-depleted cells. viral mRNA was shown to colocalize with AVGs during C7L/K1L VACV infection, thus limiting translation of viral proteins (Sivan et al., 2018) rotavirus changes cellular localization of SG components. eIF4E is relocalized to the cytoplasm, eIF4E distributes more homogeneously in the cytoplasm, and PABP is translocated to the nucleus through the viral protein NSP3. rotavirus selectively excludes certain SG components. NS viral protein has been shown to localize with SGs. the other recruited SGs-associated protein, except for eIF3b, do not localize to RFs. CVB3 2A proteinase induces SG assembly as early as 3 h post infection (hpi) at 6 hpi CVB3 induces the assembly of granules that do not contain G3BP-1 or eIF4G. atypical SGs in which TIA-1, TIAR, Sam68, and viral RNA are persistently aggregated in an eIF2 independent and cycloheximide-resistant manner remain during infection EV71 3C protease alone is sufficient to inhibit canonical SGs accumulation during late stages of infection through G3BP-1 cleavage at amino acid Q326. cells infected with EV71-2AC110S do form canonical SGs in which viral RNA is aggregated. EV71 blocks bona fide SGs but induces atypical SGs to facilitate viral translation by stalling only cellular mRNAs. G3BP-1, eIF4G, eIF3 and eIF2 protein levels are downregulated. eIF4E-BP and PKR are dephosphorylated during FMDV infection. Ye et al. showed that G3BP-1 cleavage by 3C protease impairs SG assembly. CHIKV sequestered by nsP3 in cytoplasmic foci while nsP2/3 colocalizes with nsP2/3 in complexes different from viral replication factories. CHIKV dsRNA was shown to be undetectable in dKO cells. dsRNA was shown to be undetectable in dKO cells. VEEV infected cells contain both large and small plasma membrane-bound FXR-nsP3 complexes containing viral genomic RNA. nsP3 promotes SG assembly early during infection in an eIF2 phosphorylation-dependent manner. nsP3 promotes SG assembly by sequestering G3BP-1 to sites of viral replication. in 2011, mohankumar et al. revealed that SINV infection induces the phosphorylation of eIF2. this correlates with a strong shutoff of de novo protein synthesis and 4E-BP1 dephosphorylation. nsP3 also interacts with G3BP-2. WNV inhibits arsenite, but not heat shock, or DTT-induced SG assembly. high levels of GSH (antioxidant) has been shown to counteract arsenite-induced SGs. a quantitative mass spectrometry study revealed that DENV-2 RNA interacts with the SG components G3BP-1/2, Caprin1 and USP10. ZIKV infection impairs SG assembly downstream of eIF2 phosphorylation. expression of NS3, NS4, NS2B-3 or capsid protein is sufficient to inhibit SG assembly. TIAR is partially redistributed to sites of viral replication in the perinuclear zone. down also decreases genomic RNA and viral protein levels, while HuR knockdown increases genomic RNA and protein level. together, these data suggest a possible proviral role of the SG components G3BP-1, Caprin-1, TIAR, Ataxin-2 and YB-1 in ZIKV replication. Bovine Viral Diarrhea virus impairs assembly of arsenite-induced SGs. BVDV impairs assembly of arsenite-induced SGs. hepatitis C virus relocalizes G3BP-1, PABP1, ATX2, DDX3, TIA-1, and TIAR to viral replication factories. phosphorylation of eIF2 and antagonist effect of dephosphorylation of eIF2. this tight balance allows HCV to chronically infect cells without affecting cell survival. YB-1 is involved in cellular mRNA transport, translation and decay. Dicistroviridae cricket paralysis Virus (CrPV) is the only described member of the Dicistroviridae family that regulates SG assembly. the SGs component PTB binds to TGEV genomic and subgenomic RNA and colocalizes with TGEV-induced aggregates containing TIA-1 and TIAR. eIF2 phosphorylation during TGEV infection is detrimental for viral replication. mouse Hepatitis Coronavirus induces aggregation of TIAR early during infection in an eIF2 phosphorylation-dependent manner. MHV infection does not induce the expression of factors necessary to dephosphorylate eIF2. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) induces a strong inhibition of host protein synthesis mediated by the nsp1 viral protein. the nsp1 protein interacts with the 40S ribosomal subunit, impairing 80S formation. infected cells showed a redistribution of G3BP-1 to sites of viral replication closely to the nucleus, colocalizing with NS5 or NS3 viral protein (Brocard et al., 2018; Fritzlar et al., 2019). a viral 3C-like NS6 proteinase cleaves G3BP-1, thus impeding SG assembly in infected cells. PA-X inhibits SG assembly in an eIF2-independent manner. it requires its endoribonuclease activity for this function. NP can block arsenite-induced SGs accumulation in an eIF2-independent manner. NP and DDX3 are recruited to SGs during NS1 IAV and IBV infections. in presence of NS1 NP localizes to PBs instead, suggesting that NS1 is essential for NP escape from SGs. NS1 also suppress PKR activation by blocking NF90-PKR interaction. PKR expression increases but is targeted to viral replication factories. NP, G3BP-1, dsRNA, PKR, phosphorylated PKR, RIG-I and MDA-5. PKR interaction with LCMV NP occurs but weakly than with JUNV NP. atypical SG-like structures can occur simultaneously, revealing that VSV infection suppresses the accumulation of bona fide antiviral SGs. RABV effectively replicates in cells that assemble SGs upon infection. the observed SGs contain G3BP-1, TIA-1 and PABP. RSV infection activates PKR but does not trigger eIF2 phosphorylation due to PKR sequestration by the RSV NP. two other groups reported that RSV induce SG aggregation in 1% and 5%. ADAR1 and C protein colocalize with SGs (Okonski and Samuel, 2012). SG assembly is dependent on PKR/eIF2 phosphorylation. PKR, G3BP-1 and TIA-1 depletion reduces viral protein synthesis. no new reports have been published on how members of the Bunyaviridae family modulate SG assembly. non-structural protein from the S segment of Orthobunyaviruses, Hantaviruses and Phleboviruses inhibit SG assembly despite attenuation of the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. RVFV infection promotes a protein translation shutoff due to PKR degradation by NSs protein. EBOV inhibits assembly of SGs and instead sequesters the SGs-associated proteins eIF4G, eIF3, PABP, and G3BP-1. arsenite, heat and hippuristanol can still induce bona fide SGs accumulation. single Strand RNA Retroviruses (ssRNA-RTs) retroviridae Viruses integrate its retrotranscribed (+)ssRNA into the host chromosomal DNA. the human T-Lymphotropic Virus 1 (HTLV1) tax protein blocks SG assembly by interacting with the SG components histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6). Rao et al. described a novel HIV-1 NC-induced SGs containing G3BP-1, TIAR, eIF3, PABP, and poly(A) mRNAs that are no longer disassembled by Gag or CA. the inability of NC to assembly SGs in G3BP-1 depleted cells suggests that their interaction is required to promote NC-induced SG accumulation. MMTV Gag interacts and colocalizes with the SGs component YB-1 in small cytoplasmic foci in an RNA-dependent manner. it is suggested that YB-1 plays key roles in MMTV as YB-1 knockdown results in a significant reduction in viral particle production. ICP27 inhibits phosphorylation of PKR/eIF2 and blocks SG assembly Sharma et al., 2017 SOX inhibits arsenite-induced SG assembly. ND ND EB2 overexpression does not abolish SG assembly neither PKR nor PKR. VACV lacking E3L induce AVGs which require eIF2 phosphorylation Pham et al., 2004 VACV lacking E3L induce AVGs which require TIA-1 expression. NS is recruited to SGs Carroll et al., 2014 MRV relocalizes G3BP-1, Caprin1, USP10, TIAR, TIA-1, eIF3b to RFs via G3BP1-oNS-uNS interaction Nez et al., 2018 (+)ssRNA Picornaviridae Poliovirus (PV) Yes (canonical and atypical) Yes 2A-protease mediated Zhu et al., 2016 Cleavage of eIF4GI mediated by 2A protease abolishing eIF4GI and G3BP-1 interaction.

Yes No PTB localization in SGs correlates with an increase in viral replication. ND Induces PERK-dependent eIF2 phosphorylation and subsequent SGs assembly Zhou et al., 2017 Induces Mnk1-mediated eIF4E phosphorylation. but translation repression is PKR-independent Fritzlar et al., 2019 G3BP-1 is sequestered to RFs even in presence of arsenite treatment Fritzlar et al. NS1 and NP interact with DDX3 Raman et al., 2016 NP and RIG-I are recruited to SGs on NS1 IAV infection. the NS1 RNA-binding domain and the NF90 double-stranded RNA binding domain are required. NP and GPC individually impair arsenite-induced SGs by inhibiting eIF2 phosphorylation. RNA, P and NP proteins Dinh et al., 2012 Rabies virus Yes (canonical) No SG assembly is dependent on PKR. the 5\u2018trailer region of the RSV genome is required to inhibit SGs Hanley et al., 2010 Just 1% of infected cells form SGs. MuV replicates independently of the presence or absence of SGs Hashimoto et al., 2016 Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) Yes No PKR-dependent SGs are induced by viral mRNA. SGs have an inhibitory role in HPIV3 replication. SGs Valiente-Echeverra et al., 2014 gRNA promote pre-translation initiation complex assembly Soto-Rifo et al., 2014 Gag interacts with eIF4E to promote disassembly of SGs Cinti et al., 2016 Ectopically expressed NC protein induces eIF2 phosphorylation. vhs-induced SGs accumulation correlates with increased PKR activation. a group observed higher eIF2 phosphorylation (Pasieka et al., 2008; Burgess and Mohr, 2018), others did not. this could be partly due to reduced levels of the late-expressed dsRNA binding protein Us11. TIA-1 was shown to egress before G3BP in the course of vhs-mediated SGs disassembly. TIA-1 was shown to egress before G3BP in the course of vhs-mediated SGs disassembly. the authors proposed that HSV-2 vhs modify SGs by directly or indirectly degrading mRNA. HCMV limits eIF2 phosphorylation without diminishing PERK activation. both proteins have identical amino-terminal regions and share 35% of similarity in their carboxy-terminal regions. pTRS1 and pIRS1 have redundant roles in evading antiviral response. ORF57, the HSV-1 ICP27 homologous, inhibits PKR/eIF2 phosphorylation by directly interacting with PKR via its N-terminal dsRNA-binding domain. the mechanism and the spatiotemporal regulation of SG assembly by the viral shutoff exonuclease SOX is unclear, but it might be related to its intrinsic RNA endonuclease activity similarly to HSV-2 vhs. ssDNA-binding protein I3 associates and recruits eIF4G to ssDNA formed within the RFs. despite the disruption of canonical SGs for its own benefit, infection with the replication-defective VACV lacking E3L leads to the accumulation of granule-like structures around the RFs. another mutant VACV lacking C7L/K1L induces AVG assembly. infection was abolished and abortive infection was rescued in C7L/K1L in SAMD9-depleted cells. virion host shutoff protein, an mRNA endonuclease, is essential in SGs blockade. vhs-deficient HSV-1 (vhs) infected cells do trigger SG assembly. vhs-induced SGs accumulation correlate with increased PKR activation. the authors suggest that vhs-enhanced PKR activation is a consequence of SG assembly due to dsRNA accumulation. other HSV proteins have also been involved in SGs regulation. TIA-1 was shown to egress before G3BP in the course of vhs-mediated SGs disassembly. authors proposed that HSV-2 vhs modify SGs by directly or indirectly degrading mRNA. HCMV inhibits assembly of SGs but induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) pTRS1 transfection interferes with arsenite-induced SG assembly in WT and PKR-depleted cells. pTRS1-PBD does not, suggesting that pTRS1 could also obstruct SG assembly promoted by other eIF2 kinases. expression of EBV protein EB2 does not abolish SG assembly. Vaccinia virus (VACV), a member of Poxviridae family, exploits SG components to favor viral protein production. VACV redistributes proteins from the host translation machinery and SGs, such as eIF4E, eIF4G, G3BP, and Caprin1 into viral replication factories. AVG assembly requires eIF2 phosphorylation via PKR activation. TIA-1 is an essential component of AVGs, as in its absence these antiviral granules are not formed even if PKR and eIF2 are phosphorylated. rotavirus infection does not induce SG assembly; instead it changes the cellular localization of SG components. dsRNA, TIA-1 and the viral protein E3L are not required for SG assembly. the role of each viral system, E3L and C7L/K1L, to prevent formation of AVGs in the context of viral infection remain to be studied. rotavirus selectively excludes specific SG components. uncoating of the mammalian orthoreovirus during the early stage of infection leads to eIF2 phosphorylation by the action of at least two eIF2 kinases. MRV replication occurs in viral replication factories that grow in the perinuclear region. absence of G3BP-1 the other recruited SGs-associated protein, except for eIF3b, do not localize to RFs. NS partner with NS for RF localization, carrying all other proteins with it. rotavirus replication occurs in viral replication factories. rotavirus selectively excludes specific SG components during early stage of infection. eIF2 phosphorylation occurs by the action of at least two eIF2 kinases. MRV cores are then recruited into assembled SGs. caprin1, USP10, TIAR, and TIA-1 interact with NS via RNA recognition (RRM) and an arginine/glycine-rich (RGG) motifs. NS partner with NS for RF localization, carrying all the other proteins with it. at 6 hpi CVB3 induces the assembly of granules that do not contain G3BP-1 or eIF4G, likely because of G3BP-1 cleavage. atypical SGs in which TIA-1, TIAR, Sam68, and viral RNA are persistently aggregated in an eIF2 independent and cycloheximide-resistant manner remain during infection. a mutant mengovirus induces antiviral G3BP-1 aggregations in which Caprin-1 and PKR are recruited. eIF4G, eIF3 and eIF2 protein levels are downregulated. cleavage by 3C protease impairs SG assembly. Ye et al. reported that the 3C-induced cleavage of G3BP-1 inhibits the NF-B-dependent induction of antiviral immune responses. the G3BP-1 S149A substitution impairs the negative effect of G3BP-1 on IRES translation, suggesting that G3BP-1 is an antiviral protein whose activity depends on its phosphorylation. CHIKV is the only member know to block SG assembly. dsRNA foci, nsP3-like granules and nsP1-coated structures are in close proximity. dsRNA was shown to be undetectable in G3BP-1/-2 double knock-out (dKO) cells. nsP3 promotes SG disassembly by sequestering G3BP-1 to sites of viral replication. infection with a non-G3BP-1 binding SFV promotes a persistent accumulation of SGs containing G3BP-1 and TIA-1. FMR1 triple knock-out only induces a delay in viral particles production. it has been suggested that G3BP-1 plays a potential role in encapsidation of Rubella virus (RUBV) due to the colocalization of RUBV genomic RNA. a quantitative mass spectrometry study revealed that DENV-2 RNA interacts with the SG components G3BP-1/2, Caprin1 and USP10. it has been shown that DENV infection generates a non-coding subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) that binds to G3BP-1/2 and Caprin1 impairing its ability to induce the translation of interferon Stimulated Genes (ISGs) mRNAs. YB-1 and Ataxin-2 are redistributed to the nucleus, while HuR and TIA-1 are redistributed to the cytoplasm of infected cells. TIAR is partially redistributed to sites of viral replication in the perinuclear zone, as seen on its colocalization with NS1 and viral RNA. TBEV sequesters TIA-1 and TIAR to viral replication factories. eIF2-dependent SG assembly containing the canonical SGs markers G3BP-1, eIF3 and eIF4B. BVDV impairs assembly of arsenite-induced SGs. DDX3 activates IKK during HCV infection to induce LDs biogenesis. G3BP-1, DDX3 and TIAR are required for viral RNA and protein synthesis early during infection. DDX3 and TIAR play a role in viral particle assembly. in 2016, Dixit et al. showed that Staufen1 interacts directly with PKR and NS5B. this interaction is required to inhibit PKR activation during HCV infection. also, YB-1 knockdown reduces the phosphorylation status of NS5A. CrPV 1A protein impairs assembly of arsenite-, Pateamine A-, and heat shock-induced SGs containing Rox8 and Rin, Drosophila homologs of TIA-1 and G3BP-1 respectively. CrPV-induced inhibition of SG assembly is not due to a cleavage of Rox8 or Rin despite 3C proteinase sequestration in SGs. MHV N protein strongly impairs the IFN-induced PKR signaling activation, suggesting a viral regulation of the cellular antiviral response. viral dsRNA alone activates PKR-mediated SG assembly, suggesting that the virus protects its viral dsRNA from PKR. phosphorylation at early times post infection, while induces GADD34 expression and subsequent eIF2 dephosphorylation at late stages of the course of infection in order to maintain viral protein synthesis. however, it has not been evaluated whether it result in SG assembly or blockade. porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus (PRRSV) induces canonical SG assembly mediated by PERK and eIF2 phosphorylation in infected cells. atypical SGs (aSGs) that contain TIA-1 and viral RNA, but no eIF4G nor PABP, still accumulate later in the course of PV infection. atypical SGs (aSGs) that contain TIA-1 and viral RNA, but no eIF4G nor PABP, still accumulate later in the course of PV infection. at 6 hpi CVB3 induces the assembly of granules that do not contain G3BP-1 or eIF4G, likely because of G3BP-1 cleavage. atypical SGs in which TIA-1, TIAR, Sam68, and viral RNA are persistently aggregated in an eIF2 independent and cycloheximide-resistant manner remain during infection. EV71 blocks bona fide SGs but induces atypical SGs to facilitate viral translation by stalling only cellular mRNAs. encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) infection does not induce SG assembly at all. cleavage of G3BP-1 is the mechanism for their disruption. Visser et al. argued that the 3C-induced cleavage of G3BP-1 inhibits the NF-B-dependent induction of antiviral immune responses. the G3BP-1 S149A substitution impairs the negative effect of G3BP-1 on IRES translation, suggesting that G3BP-1 is an antiviral protein whose activity depends on its phosphorylation. togaviridae Among viruses of togaviridae family, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) is the only member know to block SG assembly. dsRNA foci, nsP3-like granules and nsP1-coated structures are in close proximity. dsRNA was shown to be undetectable in dKO cells. nsP3 promotes SG assembly early during infection in an eIF2 phosphorylation-dependent manner. at late stages of infection nsP3 promotes SG disassembly by sequestering G3BP-1 to sites of viral replication. nsP3 also interacts with G3BP-2. G3BP-1 plays a potential role in the encapsidation of Rubella virus (RUBV) due to the colocalization of RUBV genomic RNA. TIA-1 and TIAR colocalize with viral replication complexes. TF4 and Nrf2 colocalize with viral replication complexes containing dsRNA and NS3 in dengue Virus type 2 (DENV-2) infected cells. it has been shown that DENV infection generates a non-coding subgenomic flaviviral RNA (sfRNA) that binds to G3BP-1/2, Caprin1 and USP10. expression of NS3, NS4, NS2B-3 or capsid protein is sufficient to inhibit SG assembly. YB-1 and Ataxin-2 are redistributed to the nucleus, while HuR and TIA-1 are redistributed to the cytoplasm of infected cells. TIAR is partially redistributed to sites of viral replication in the perinuclear zone. MVEV and YFV capsid-expressing cells showed a significantly impairment in hippuristanol-induced SG assembly. a JEV virus carrying a non Caprin-1-binding core protein is less pathogenic in mice. TBEV sequesters TIA-1 and TIAR to viral replication factories. hepatitis C virus (HCV) relocalizes G3BP-1, PABP1, ATX2, DDX3, TIA-1, and TIAR to viral replication factories in lipid droplets (LDs). DDX3 activates IKK during HCV infection to induce LDs biogenesis. YB-1 regulates SG assembly by inducing G3BP-1 mRNA translation through its interaction with the 5\u2032UTR of the mRNA. in 2016, Dixit et al. showed that Staufen1 interacts directly with PKR and NS5B. this interaction is required to inhibit PKR activation during HCV infection to allow viral RNA translation. CrPV 1A protein impairs assembly of arsenite-, Pateamine A-, and heat shock-induced SGs containing Rox8 and Rin, Drosophila homologs of TIA-1 and G3BP-1 respectively. CrPV-induced inhibition of SG assembly is not due to a cleavage of Rox8 or Rin despite 3C proteinase sequestration in SGs. MHV infection does not induce the expression of factors necessary to dephosphorylate eIF2 such as CHOP and GADD34. MHV N protein strongly impairs the IFN-induced PKR signaling activation, suggesting a viral regulation of the cellular antiviral response. Infectious Bronchitis Coronavirus (IBV) induces PERK and eIF2 phosphorylation at early times post infection, while induces GADD34 expression and subsequent eIF2 dephosphorylation at late stages of the course of infection. but it has not been evaluated whether it result in SG assembly or blockade. MNV1 infected cells showed a redistribution of G3BP-1 to sites of viral replication closely to the nucleus, colocalizing with NS5 (Fritzlar et al., 2019), or NS3 viral protein (Brocard et al., 2018). Interestingly, MNV impairs SG assembly by sequestering G3BP-1, thus uncoupling the cellular stress response. NP can block arsenite-induced SGs accumulation in an eIF2-independent manner. NS-1 binding to dsRNA inhibits PKR autophosphorylation and subsequent eIF2 phosphorylation. NP and DDX3 are recruited to SGs during NS1 IAV infection. NF90 binds preferentially to it rather than PKR, suggesting that NS1 also suppress PKR activation by blocking NF90-PKR interaction. the vRNA sensor retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I) is recruited to SGs. PKR interaction with LCMV NP occurs but weakly than with JUNV NP, which is reflected in the lack of PKR upregulation and colocalization with NP. the vesicular stomatitis virus promotes eIF2 phosphorylation and downregulates the synthesis of cellular proteins while maintaining viral production. the observed SGs contain G3BP-1, TIA-1 and PABP. their accumulation is dependent on PKR-induced eIF2 phosphorylation. RABV-induced SGs locate adjacent to viral RFs. measles virus (MeV) infection does not induce SG assembly due to the PKR inhibitory effect of the viral accessory protein C. both ADAR1 and C protein colocalize with SGs (Pfaller et al., 2013). SG assembly is dependent on PKR/eIF2 phosphorylation and its suppression reduces viral protein synthesis. cellular mRNAs have been shown to be predominately recruited to SGs. PKR, G3BP-1 and TIA-1 depletion reduces MeV-SGs. no new reports have been published on how members of the Bunyaviridae family modulate SG assembly. eIF2 is due eIF2 PKR-dependent phosphorylation triggered by viral mRNAs, which can be shielded. granules do not require eIF2 phosphorylation, do not disassemble with cycloheximide. arsenite, heat and hippuristanol can still induce bona fide SGs accumulation. VP35-CTD contains an inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) domain. the host-shutoff protein polymerase-acidic protein-X (PA-X), the nucleoprotein (NP) and the non-structural protein 1 (NS1) inhibit SG assembly in an eIF2-independent manner. PA-X depletes poly(A) RNAs from the cytoplasm but promotes its accumulation in the nuclei. NP and DDX3 are recruited to SGs during NS1 IAV and IBV infections. but in presence of NS1 NP localizes to PBs instead. NS1 also suppresses PKR activation by blocking NF90-PKR interaction. PKR expression increases but is targeted to viral replication factories (RFs) with NP, G3BP-1, dsRNA, PKR, phosphorylated PKR, RIG-I, and MDA-5. PKR interaction with LCMV NP occurs but weakly than with JUNV NP. phosphoprotein (P) and NP are also part of these atypical SG-like structures. assembly of aSGs and bona fide arsenite-induced SGs can occur simultaneously. RABV effectively replicates in cells that assemble SGs upon infection. RSV infection activates PKR but does not trigger eIF2 phosphorylation due to PKR sequestration by the RSV NP. two other groups reported that RSV induce SG aggregation in 1% and 5%. sendai virus (SeV) induces SGs accumulation in just a fraction of the cells (5\u201315%) and the 5\u2032 trailer region of its sequence has been implicated in SG assembly prevention via interaction with TIAR. the effect on SG assembly of more paramyxoviruses have been studied. no new reports have been published on how members of the Bunyaviridae family modulate SG assembly. SG assembly is due eIF2 PKR-dependent phosphorylation triggered by viral mRNAs. SG assembly is due eIF2 PKR-dependent phosphorylation. the Andes Hantavirus (ANDV) N protein inhibits PKR dimerization. but this lack of activation does not stop protein translation. EBOV VP35-CTD contains an inhibition of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) domain that is responsible for blocking PKR activation. VP35 can interact with several SG-associated proteins such as G3BP-1, eIF3 and eEF2. it is targeted to viral replication factories, suggesting that it may be blocking SG assembly by relocating SG constituents. HIV-1 Gag also disassembles pre-formed arsenite-induced SGs by interacting with eIF4E. the inability of NC to assembly SGs in G3BP-1 depleted cells suggests that their interaction is required to promote NC-induced SG accumulation. HIV-1 is unable to dissociate or block arsenite-induced SG assembly in Staufen1 knock-out cells. eIF4GI and PABPC1 form a pre-translation initiation complex with the HIV-1 genomic RNA to promote viral translation. the viral genomic RNA recruits TIAR in a different type of RNA granules where it is suggested that the transition from translation to packaging occurs. MMTV Gag interacts and colocalizes with the SGs component YB-1 in small cytoplasmic foci in an RNA-dependent manner. phosphorylation, dsRNA partially localize to SGs, and SG assembly activates PKR Burgess and Mohr. 2018 ICP27 inhibits phosphorylation of PKR/eIF2 and blocks SG assembly Panas et al., 2017 SOX inhibits arsenite-induced SG assembly.

PB assembly requires cellular but no viral RNA synthesis. PB assembly requires cellular but no viral RNA synthesis. rotavirus has also been shown to suppress PB assembly. rotavirus infection induces the relocalization of Xrn1, Dcp1a, and PABP to the nucleus. sfRNA colocalizes with Xrn1 in PBs and is essential for viral-mediated cytopathogenesis. DENV infection reduces PBs accumulation through an interaction of DENV 3\u2032UTR with DDX6. Dcp1b colocalizes with viral dsRNA, suggesting that DENV RNA replication occurs within PBs. downregulation of LSm1 negatively affects viral RNA accumulation and particle production. nonsense-mediated mRNA decay transcripts are stabilized in ZIKV-infected cells. mRNA decay (NMD) transcripts are stabilized in infected cells. upregulation of Upf1 prior to infection significantly increases RNA viral levels and consequently viral production. DDX6 was shown to not be recruited to sites of viral replication at lipid droplets. it does not colocalize with Dcp1 in human hepatocytes in vivo. however, differences in PB composition remain to be elucidated. CVB3 2A protease relocalizes AUF1 (also known as hnRNP D) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells. 3C protease cleaves AUF1 (also known as hnRNP D) thus CVB3 counteracts AUF1-induced degradation of the viral RNA genome. MOV10 is a positive regulator of EV71 replication through its binding to a cloverleaf-like structure and the IRES of viral RNA. Upon EV71 infection MOV10 co-localized with PBs. it is suggested that MOV10 relocalization is a host response to impair viral MOV10 recruitment. negative-strand RNA virus IAV suppresses PB assembly via interaction of NS1 and RAP55. the Bunyaviridae hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) avoids the 5\u2032 cap degradation of cellular mRNAs. it has been shown that HIV-1 gRNA localize to PBs. that observation has not been reproduced by others. APOBEC3 has been shown to have an anti-HIV-1 activity. but it is targeted for degradation by the viral protein Vif. the first assembly intermediate (AI) in which Gag interacts with genomic RNA are formed by the recruitment of DDX6 and ATP-binding cassette protein E1 (ABCE1). HTLV-1 Tax protein interferes with host NMD by its interaction with Upf1 and INT6. dsDNA Adenoviridae Adenovirus No Yes Relocalization of DDX6, LSm1, Ge-1, Ago2 and Xrn1 to aggresomes dependent on E4 11K viral protein Greer et al., 2011 Relocalization of DDX6, LSm1, Ge-1, and Xrn1 to aggresomes dependent on E4 11K viral protein Friedman and Karen. Xnr1 and Dcp1 are translocated to the nucleus dependent on the viral protein NSP3 Montero et al., 2008 Most of PBs-associated proteins, except DDX6, Edc4, and Pan3, are recruited into RFs Dhillon and Rao, 2018. Chahar et al., 2013 dengue Virus (DENV) No Yes LSm1, GW182, DDX6, DDX3, MOV10, and et al., 2010 Kunjin virus (KUNV), Australian strain of DENV Yes* No sfRNA co-localizes at PBs and inhibits Xrn1 activity Pijlman et al., 2008; Moon et al., 2012 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Yes* Yes DDX6, LSm1, Xrn1, PATL1, Ago2, Dicer, and DDX3 localize to lipid droplets A ND ND Upf1 is a restriction factor for SFV Balistreri et al., 2014 Coronaviridae Mouse Hepatitis Coronavirus (MHC) Yes No Induces host translational shutoff Raaben et al., 2007 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) ND SCoV nsp1-mediated promotion of host mRNA degradation Kamitani et al., 2009; TGEV no Yes Decreases the number of PBs Sola et al., 2011 (-)ssRNA Orthomyxoviridae Influenza virus A (IAV) No Yes NS1 interacts with RAP55, Ago1, Ago2 and Dcp1a Mok et al., 2012 Bunyaviridae Hanta virus Yes* No Cap snatching occurs in PBs Mir et al., 2008 Paramyxovi ND Assembly intermediates are formed by DDX6, Dcp2, and ABCE1 Reed et al., 2018 Human T-cell lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-1) Yes No Tax inhibits NMD by targeting Upf1 and INT6 Mocquet et al., 2012 A fraction of viral RNA colocalizes in PBs Mocquet et al., 2012; Nakano et al., 2013 Rex inhibits Upf1 MV-induced PB assembly requires cellular but no viral RNA synthesis. KSHV prevents PB assembly during latent and lytic infection thanks to the activation of the cytoskeletal regulator RhoA GTPase (RhoA) PB assembly requires cellular but no viral RNA synthesis. PB assembly requires cellular but no viral RNA synthesis. rotavirus has also been shown to suppress PB assembly. rotavirus infection induces the relocalization of Xrn1, Dcp1a, and PABP to the nucleus (Montero et al., 2008; Bhowmick et al., 2015), and to sequester most of the PB components into RFs. Upon infection, it reduces the cytosolic levels of Xrn1, Pan3, and Dcp1a, but no GW182 in a time-dependent flavivirus RNA (sfRNA) is a product of genomic RNA incomplete degradation by the exonuclease Xrn1. Xrn1 stalls on highly structured sequences in the 3\u2032 UTR. sfRNA colocalizes with Xrn1 in PBs and is essential for viral-mediated cytopathogenesis. NS4A and NS3 interact with IRAV, which is a constituent of PBs. IRAV is relocalized to viral RFs in HEK-293T cells and in monocyte-derived macrophages. MOV10 is also relocalized to viral RFs. decapping activators DDX6, LSm1, and PatL1 are crucial for the transition from translation to replication of HCV RNA. PB constituents play key roles during HCV infection, but presence of PBs is not necessary for efficient viral replication. dysregulation causes stabilization of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in innate immune responses and transcription factors. mRNAs encoding proteins involved in innate immune responses and transcription factors have short half-life in uninfected cells. enterovirus 71 (EV71) increases the number of PBs at early stages but disrupts PBs at late stages of infection. EV71 2C protease reduces the expression of APOBEC3G (A3G) by targeting to degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway. upf1 knockdown increases SINV and Semliki Forest Virus (SFV) RNA replication. MHV induces degradation of several cellular mRNAs encoding translation-related factors with a concomitant translational shut off. the flavivirus WNV reduces PB assembly during the course of infection through the sequestration of several PB components such as LSm1, GW182, Xrn1, DDX3 and DDX6 to viral replication factories (RFs) in 2016 Balinsky et al. showed that NS4A and NS3 interact with IRAV, which is induced by DENV infection in an interferon-dependent manner. both DDX6 and DGCR8 are upregulated in ZIKV-infected neurospheres. nonsense-mediated mRNA decay transcripts are stabilized in ZIKV-infected cells. upregulation of Upf1 prior to infection significantly increases RNA viral levels. analysis of liver biopsies from HCV-infected patients confirmed that HCV decreases the number of PB in vivo independent of the viral genotype, the inflammation status of the sample donor or whether the infection is chronical or recent. DDX6 did not colocalize with Dcp1 in human hepatocytes in vivo. the picornaviruses PV and CVB3 3C proteases cleave Dcp1a and target Xrn1 and Pan3 for proteasomal degradation. in addition, CVB3 2A protease relocalizes AUF1 (also known as hnRNP D) from the nucleus to the cytoplasm of infected cells and 3C protease cleaves AUF1. MOV10 is a positive regulator of EV71 replication through its binding to the viral 5\u2032UTR thus displacing PCBP1. Upon EV71 infection MOV10 co-localized with PBs. it is suggested that MOV10 relocalization is a host response to impair viral MOV10 recruitment. the mechanism behind MHV-induced regulation of mRNA decay is still unknown. TGEV infection decreases significantly the number of PBs by an unknown mechanism. negative-strand RNA virus IAV suppresses PB assembly via interaction of NS1 and RAP55. the negative-strand RNA virus IAV suppresses PB assembly via interaction of NS1 and RAP55. the Bunyaviridae hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N) avoids the 5\u2032 cap degradation of cellular mRNAs, protecting them from Dcp1a/Dcp2-mediated decapping. the infection of RSV decreases the number of Dcp1-containing puncta late in infection. some groups have reported that DDX6, LSm1, GW182, Xrn1, DGCR8, Dicer, and Drosha are antiviral factors. APOBEC3 has been shown to have an anti-HIV-1 activity, but it is targeted for degradation by the viral protein Vif (Poblete-Dur\u00e1n et al., 2016). gPol, and Vif (Lingappa et al., 1997) formed by the recruitment of DDX6 and ATP-binding cassette protein E1 (ABCE1) suggesting that HIV-1 hijack PB-components to promote viral assembly. HTLV-1 Tax protein interferes with host NMD by its interaction with Upf1 and INT6. dsDNA Adenoviridae Adenovirus No Yes Relocalization of DDX6, LSm1, Ge-1, Ago2 and Xrn1 to aggresomes dependent on E4 11K viral protein Greer et al., 2011 Relocalization of DDX6, LSm1, Ge-1, and Xrn1 to aggresomes dependent on E4 11K viral protein Friedman and Karen. most of PBs-associated proteins, except DDX6, Edc4, and Pan3, are recruited into RFs Dhillon and Rao, 2018; Dhillon et al., 2018 (+)ssRNA Flaviviridae west Nile virus (WNV) No Yes LSm1, GW182, DDX6, DDX3, MOV10, and Xrn1 are sequestered to RFs Emara and Brinton, 2007; Chahar et Moon et al., 2012 Hepatitis C virus (HCV) Yes* Yes DDX6, LSm1, Xrn1, PATL1, Ago2, Dicer, and DDX3 localize to lipid droplets Ariumi et al., 2011; Berezhna et al., 2011; Pager et al., 2013 Dcp1 and GW182 not localize to viral factories P\u00e9rez-Vilar\u00f3 e ND ND ND Cleavage of MOV10 by 3C protease Cuevas et al., 2016 Enterovirus 71 (EV-71) Yes Yes Disrupts DDX6 and Dcp1a foci Zhu et al., 2016; Yang et al., 2018b EV71 2C protein reduces the expression of A3G through autophagy\u2013lysosome pathway Li et al., 2016 MOV10 co ae Influenza virus A (IAV) No Yes NS1 interacts with RAP55, Ago1, Ago2 and Dcp1a Mok et al.

Nakano et al., 2013 Rex inhibits Upf1 activity. relationship between HIV-1 and PB components still controversial. V10 protects A3G from degradation by interfering with the interaction between Vif and the ubiquitin CBF--Cullin 5-ElonginB-ElonginC complex. HTLV-1 tax protein interferes with host NMD by its interaction with Upf1 and INT6. a fraction of viral genomic RNA co-localized with PBs. tax stabilizes the SMG5 and Upf1 interaction. tax inhibits Upf1 binding to its substrate and also destabilizes Upf1 during both unwinding and translocation. PB disruption during latency requires RhoA activation, mediated by vGPCR activation pathway (vGPCR-MK2) Corcoran et al., 2012 PBs disruption during latency requires RhoA activation. dsRNA Reoviridae Rotavirus No Yes Xrn1, Dcp1, and Pan3, but not GW182 protein levels are reduced. binds to dengue virus RNA 3' UTR and localizes to viral RFs Dong et al., 2015 Zika Virus No No DDX6 and DGCR8 are upregulated in ZIKV-infected neurospheres Garcez et al., 2017 ZIKV capsid protein specifically targets nuclear Upf1 for degradation via the proteasome Fontaine et al.
