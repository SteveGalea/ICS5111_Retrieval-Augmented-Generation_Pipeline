CC mice are publicly available and can be obtained from the SGCF at UNC. a subset of 3,295 markers overlapped between GigaMUGA and miniMUGA genotyping platforms. the obligate ancestors for each line were genotyped using a combination of megaMUGA and GigaMUGA platforms. the obligate ancestors for each line were genotyped using a forward-backward Hidden Markov Model (HMM) BB was the highest probability for the marker in any other obligate ancestor for the strain and the probability of AA was set to 0. Similarly the sample or samples with BB as the maximum probability with value r, r was added to AB and BB set to 0. the maximum probability for each founder-state was then selected from the set of obligate ancestors. multi- string burrows-wheeler transforms (msBWTs) were constructed using the raw fastq sequencing reads of each CC sample. the msBWT data structure is a lossless compressed representation of the raw sequenced reads that can be efficiently queried for any specific subsequence. a consensus sequence was constructed for 45 to 60 bases inside of the missing interval. the new consensus sequence was used to extend into the near-zero interval until either the gap closed or the new consensus\u2019 edit distance from the reference was inconsistent with a simple polymorphism. the six new strains were born between May 2014 and August 2015. Mice used for sequencing were all males and born between April 2016 and July 2016. the obligate ancestors for each line were genotyped using a combination of megaMUGA and GigaMUGA platforms. the obligate ancestors for each line were genotyped using a forward-backward Hidden Markov Model (HMM) a forward-backward HMM was used to estimate the founder-state probability at each marker based on its genotype. the maximum probability for each founder-state was then selected from the set of obligate ancestors. the resulting vector of 36 maximum probabilities were normalized. there are small differences in how sex chromosomes are treated. the msBWT data structure is a lossless compressed representation of the raw sequenced reads that can be efficiently queried for any specific subsequence. the first was to query each genome against the set of annotated variants from the Sanger Institute. the resulting read counts were archived as a data matrix and used for deletion discovery. data availability Genotypes for MiniMUGA and GigaMUGA are available at the MMRRC-UNC https://www.med.unc.edu/mmrrc/genotypes. 36 state probabilities and haplotype reconstruction of the MRCAs for the six additional CC strains are publicly available at http://csbio.unc.edu/CCstatus/index.py\"run=FounderProbs. the average residual heterozygosity of the six new strains is 19.9%, compared to 8.0% in the previously released strains. CC083/Unc has the unique distinction among CC strains, where three haplotypes are segregating at a locus. we observe the same pattern in the new CC strains where wild-derived haplotypes are enriched in regions of residual heterozygosity (P 0.0001). the same pattern in the new CC strains where wild-derived haplotypes are enriched in regions of residual heterozygosity (P 0.0001). chromosome 5 contains a locus between 127Mb and 137Mb. currently only one CC strain has a CAST/EiJ founder haplotype. this partially relieves the deficit of these underrepresented haplotypes in the CC population. the eight founder strains of the CC have been sequenced at high depth, their variants annotated, and their genome recently de novo assembled. previous genetic variation analyses have used sequence from these founders to infer haplotype specific genetic variation in the CC. we identified four unique de novo deletions larger than 500bp in the newly sequenced mice that are not present in the assembled reference genome of the CC founders or in the previous cohort of 69 sequenced CC mice. the breakpoints were resolved using msBWTs to locally assemble sequence flanking the deletion. ENSMUSR00000759294 CC079/TauUnc 2 129264616 129265201 129264705 129265185 0.585 37 PWK/PhJ Gm14024 CC081/Unc. the deletion spans the pseudogene Gm14515. the colony survey also allows us to estimate current levels of corresponding MRCA. the four clear outliers that have both a high level of current heterozygosity and a small decrease in residual heterozygosity are four of the six new CC strains. genetic drift has likely fixed regions of residual heterozygosity in the MRCAs. experimental mice will not contain any additional haplotypes not already in the MRCAs. genome sequence from a single male for 75 CC strains is excellent resource. msBWT k-mer search is a fast and user-friendly tool to query any k-mer shorter than read length and returns matching sequence. the colony survey of 72 CC strains using the set of 6,293 markers defined in the Materials and Methods is a resource that will allow CC users to confirm the strain ID of their CC mice. vQTL mapping studies, F2 mapping studies, recombinant inbred crosses. accurate analyses and interpretation of experimental results will likely benefit from genotyping individual experimental animals to ensure accurate haplotype assignment. if only one of the two haplotypes at a locus influences a trait, a haplotype may influence genetic mapping."}
