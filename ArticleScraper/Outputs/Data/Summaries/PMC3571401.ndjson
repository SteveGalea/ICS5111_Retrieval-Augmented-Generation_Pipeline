{"summary": "coVs contain a positive, single-stranded RNA genome of about 30 kb. replicase gene encodes two large precursor polyproteins. nsp1 is the first to be expressed (2, 4\u20137). the largest differences in the replicase gene can be found in the 5\u2032 end. the most N-terminal cleavage product, nsp1, is considered one of the genus-specific markers (10, 16). nsp1 from -CoV, that from -CoVA, and that from -CoVB are different in size, 110, 250, and 180 amino acids respectively. nsp1 suggest that a short sequence in the 5\u2032 end protects the viral RNA from degradation. a mutation in the cleavage site between nsp1 and nsp2 in the -CoV transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) preventing the release of nsp1 leads to a drastic decrease in the viability of the virus (27). the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen) grown in LB medium at 37\u00b0C. when optical density reached 0.6, the culture was transferred to 25\u00b0C. after 3 to 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. the protein was eluted with 2.5 ml elution buffer (same as wash buffer but with 250 mM imidazole) the buffer was exchanged on a PD-10 column and eluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0, 14 mM -mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0. the protein sample was diluted with 20 mM Tris-HCl to a NaCl concentration of 150 mM and then concentrated to between 3 to 10 g/l in a Vivaspin concentrator. a second construct with a 5-amino-acid C-terminal truncation and an N-terminal His6 tag was cloned into the expression vector pEXP5. native crystals were dipped for a few seconds in reservoir solution supplemented with 15% glycerol before vitrification in liquid nitrogen. crystals for phasing were soaked for 2 h in reservoir solution supplemented with 10 mM K2PtCl4 and then back soaked for 30 min in the same solution. eer software program (37) was used to create a first trace of the polypeptide backbone. final refinement was performed using translation, libration, skew (TLS) refinement. in the N-terminal region of the A chain, density for the two first residues in the N-terminal region was missing. a full-length construct of TGEV nsp1 was cloned into the expression plasmid pDEST14 (Invitrogen) the protein was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-AI cells (Invitrogen) grown in LB medium at 37\u00b0C. after 3 to 5 h, the cells were harvested by centrifugation. in 20 ml lysis buffer (50 mM Na2HPO4, 50 mM Na2SO4, 100 mM HEPES, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 10 mM imidazole, 0.5% Triton X-100, 14 mM -mercaptoethanol, pH 8.0) the cells were subsequently lysed under 2 105 kPa of pressure using a Constant cell disrupter. the fractions from the peak corresponding to a monomer of the TGEV nsp1 protein were pooled and diluted four times with 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, to a NaCl concentration of 75 mM. the protein was then applied to a 1-ml hiTrapQ anion exchange column (GE Healthcare), which washed with 20 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 75 mM NaC initial crystal hits were obtained at 20\u00b0C under two conditions in the JCSG+ suite (Qiagen): A9 (200 mM ammonium chloride and 20% [wt/vol] polyethylene glycol [PEG] 3350) and H7 (200 mM ammonium sulfate, 100 mM Bis-Tris, pH 5.5, and 25% [wt/vol] PEG 3350) the images were indexed and integrated in the software program MOSFLM (29) and scaled in the program Scala (30, 31) the space group was determined to be P1, with two molecules in the asymmetric unit, related by a noncrystallographic 2-fold axis. the solvent content was estimated to be 40%, with a Matthews coefficient of 2.08 (31, 33) 1 Cell angles (\u00b0) 91.3, 109.1, 94.2 90.9, 109.4, 93.9 Resolution range () 27.4\u20131.5 (1.58\u20131.50) 40.3\u20132.5 (2.64\u20132.5) No. of reflections measured 122,299 (17,500) 167,992 (24,887) No. of unique reflections 30,811 (4,441) 6,888 (9,98) Avg multiplicity 4.0 (3.9) 24.4 (24.9) Completeness (%) the TGEV nsp1 structure exhibits an irregular -barrel fold. initial crystallization trials were performed with protein from a construct expressing full-length TGEV nsp1. no data of sufficient quality could be collected. Strands 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 8 are unique to TGEV nsp1. they are not found in SARS-CoV nsp113\u2013128. a small cavity is located at the top of the barrel between 5 and 7. sequences from -CoV and -CoVB were aligned separately. a careful structure-based sequence alignment was used to merge the alignments of -CoV and -CoVB. conservation within the alphacoronavirus genus. the surface of the TGEV nsp1 structure exhibits two highly conserved areas. the first is located on a ridge formed by loops between strands 1-2 and 7-8 together with strand 2. the second conserved patch is mainly made up from side chains from strand 8. p13, Gln15, Asn92, and Asn94 make up a conserved circle. the second area (B), centered on strand 8, displays both exposed hydrophobic residues and charged residues that could interact with a partner molecule or partner protein. the loop between 5 and 6 is significantly shorter in the TGEV nsp1 structure. the small cavity with Glu29 as a gatekeeper is not conserved. however, it is not likely to be conserved throughout the -CoVB lineage. meida et al. (28), is roughly conserved within -CoVB. only the two glycines are conserved, both of which appear to be located in the linker region between nsp1 and nsp2. most of these, like Ile8, Ile88, Phe43, Val44, Val52, Ile88, and Val89, are part of the conserved hydrophobic cluster. the TGEV nsp1 structure is characterized by an irregular six-stranded -barrel, flanked by a small -sheet connected to a short 310 helix. four antiparallel strands, 3, 7, 5, and 6, make up one side of the barrel. a small cavity is located at the top of the barrel between 5 and 7 next to the -helix. the cavity is lined by residues Val18, Pro19, Leu21, Val26, Glu26, Tyr41, Val61, Ile62, and Val89 and the aliphatic stem of Arg90. a large portion of the conserved residues in -CoV make up the hydrophobic core of the -barrel fold. these include Val44, Val52, Val61, Leu77, Leu84, Phe87, Ile88, and Val89. this cluster is connected to a solvent-exposed hydrophobic patch consisting of Phe43 and Phe100, via Gly86. the surface of the TGEV nsp1 structure exhibits two highly conserved areas. the first is located on a ridge formed by the loops between strands 1-2 and 7-8 together with strand 2. on the ridge, Asp13, Gln15, Asn92, and Asn94, all conserved, are positioned in a ring around Tyr14, which is not. TGEV nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp113\u2013128 are shown as cartoons and surface representation displaying the conserved areas. subfigures C, F, I, and L show the electrostatic surface potentials of the two structures from 4/+4 mV. a tunnel in the -CoV nsp113\u2013128 structure is not found in TGEV nsp1. however, it is not likely to be conserved throughout the -CoVB lineage. so far, the viruses that belong to -CoVB show lower diversity than those in -CoV. he43, Val44, Val52, Ile88, and Val89 are part of the conserved hydrophobic cluster. the -bulge located by Gly86 seems absolutely conserved throughout -CoV and -CoVB. the poor sequence conservation between -CoV and -CoVB is also reflected in the surface electrostatics. conserved residues were plotted onto the surface of the TGEV nsp1 protein. a large portion of the conserved residues, centered on the highly conserved strand 7, make up the core of the protein and are more likely to be involved in the structural stability of the protein than to be important for the function. TGEV nsp1 suppresses protein translation in the first experiment. but not in the second, suggesting that a host factor that exists in the HeLa extracts but not in RRL is needed for TGEV nsp1 function. lack of conservation is also reflected in the shape and electrostatics of the TGEV and SARS-CoV nsp113\u2013128 structures. nsp1 proteins from two other alphacoronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, have been shown to immunoprecipitate together with the S6 protein, which is part of the 40S subunit (46). nsp1 proteins from two other alphacoronaviruses, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, have been shown to immunoprecipitate together with the S6 protein, which is part TGEV nsp1 structure has the same fold as SARS-CoV nsp113\u2013128. this suggests that the nsp1s are evolutionarily related."}
