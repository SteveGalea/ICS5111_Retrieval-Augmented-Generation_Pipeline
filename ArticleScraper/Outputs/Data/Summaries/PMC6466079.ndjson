{"summary": "new MERS-CoV cases are still being reported in the Arabian Peninsula. this is partly due to the continuous zoonotic introduction of this virus to the human population in this region by dromedaries [12], suggesting the efficient transmission of this virus. this review highlights the role of some MERS-CoV-interacting host factors in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. the review highlights the role of some MERS-CoV-interacting host factors\u2014especially DPP4\u2014in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. there are 11 critical residues within the -propeller domain that directly interact with the S1 protein [29,30,31]. ferrets, rats, and mice resist MERS-CoV infection due to differences in some critical DPP4 residues [31,34,35,36] MERS-CoV uses the C-terminal part of its S protein to interact with host proteases, such as furin, TMPRSS2 and cathepsins. these proteases induce conformational changes, allowing fusion between viral and host cellular membranes. once fusion with host cell membranes has occurred, MERS-CoV subsequently replicates its genetic material and produces viral proteins in the cell cytoplasm. MERS-CoV has been isolated from dromedary camels and humans. both species are not only susceptible to MERS-CoV infection, but also capable of transmitting this virus. current data indicate that virus spread is more efficient in dromedary camels than in humans. in most of these species, there is a preferential upper respiratory tract expression of DPP4 observed. in most of these species, there is a preferential upper respiratory tract expression of DPP4 observed. in most of these species, there is a preferential upper respiratory tract expression of DPP4 observed. horses, llamas, alpacas, and pigs mainly express DPP4 in the upper respiratory tract. horses did not seroconvert and only shed infectious virus in a limited amount. a chronic co-infection in the guttural pouch may be one of the explanations. new world camelids, i.e., alpacas and llamas, are able to transmit the virus to respective nave animals upon contact. pigs and rabbits shed low levels of infectious virus upon MERS-CoV inoculation. pigs and rabbits shed low levels of infectious virus upon MERS-CoV inoculation. nized 2,3-sialic acid glycotopes in the respiratory tract of dromedary camel, pig, rabbit, human, and sheep. the preference of MERS-CoV to use certain host proteases is influenced by the type of target cell and the cleavage stage of their S protein prior to infection. this suggests that host proteases from different host species may determine species and tissue tropism of MERS-CoV. smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have been shown to upregulate DPP4 expression in the lungs. this suggests that some host factors may dictate the outcome of MERS-CoV infection, thus rendering intraspecies variation observed among MERS-CoV patients. macaques that expressed DPP4 in type II pneumocytes developed moderate-to-severe infection, while macaques generally developed mild transient pneumonia. adapted MERS-CoV through serial passaging or upregulating DPP4 expression throughout the airway epithelium in mice, however, will induce severe clinical disease [55,56]. the absence of type I interferon signaling in mice also resulted in more severe clinical manifestations and histopathological lesions upon MERS-CoV infection. further investigation of the host determinants of MERS-CoV pathogenesis may offer insights for developing novel therapeutic measures. host factors remain the most significant determinant in explaining inter- and intraspecies variations observed in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission. host factors remain the most significant determinant in explaining inter- and intraspecies variations observed in MERS-CoV pathogenesis and transmission."}
