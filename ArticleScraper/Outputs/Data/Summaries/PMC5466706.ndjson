{"summary": "more than 4500 viral species have been discovered; their sequence information has been collected by researchers. avian influenza H5N1 virus [4], SARS coronavirus, H1N1 pandemic, MERS coronavirus [5], Ebola virus [6], and Zika virus [7] have emerged in the human population. unbiased next-generation sequencing (NGS) is emerging as an attractive approach for viral identification from varied samples. VirusTAP is a web-based integrated NGS analysis tool for viral genome assembly from metagenomic reads [13]. this user-friendly tool enables users to obtain viral genomes more easily by uploading raw NGS reads and clicking on several selections. drVM (detect and reconstruct known viral genomes from metagenomes) is a bioinformatics pipeline that provides rapid classification of NGS reads generated by Illumina or Ion Torrent sequencing technology. viral sequences with taxonomic ID not included in the virus division (division id = 9), those with taxonomic information absent and those lacking genus-level annotation were labeled \u201cnonViral, \u201cnoTax\u201d and \u201cnoGenus\u201d respectively. the remaining viral sequences were used as rawDB. drVM pipeline is implemented in Python and incorporates several open-source tools, including BLAST, SNAP, and SPAdes. the package comprises two modules: CreateDB.py and drVM.py. drVM.py takes single- or paired-end reads as input. reads are aligned to contigs by means of SOAP2 [35] and the read-covered contigs are placed into a coverage plot with reference-guide coordinates. drVM.py processes viral sequences to produce SNAP and BLAST databases. each run was analyzed by drVM: drVM.py -1 read1.fastq -2 read2.fastq -t 16 (-type iontorrent for Ion Torrent datasets) each run was analyzed by drVM on a server (intel Xeon E7-4820, 2.00GHz

single- or paired-end reads as input. it aligns reads to SNAP DB and, accordingly, identifies viral reads. each group is labeled according to its genus. drVM.py processes viral sequences to produce SNAP and BLAST databases. simulated reads were concatenated to 1-Gbp sequencing reads. reads of liver cancer cells and reads from the human microbiome project were taken as host and bacterial metagenomes. each run was analyzed by drVM: drVM.py -1 read1.fastq -2 read2.fastq -t 16 (-type iontorrent for Ion Torrent datasets) on a server (Intel Xeon E7-4820, 2.00GHz with 256 GB of RAM) each run was analyzed by drVM: drVM.py -1 read1.fastq -2 read2.fastq -t 16 ( drVM pipeline drVM was designed to detect and reconstruct known viral genomes from metagenomes. the viral sequences downloaded from NCBI were processed by CreateDB.py to produce SNAP and BLAST databases. the module is distributed as a Docker image in the Docker Hub repository, an Amazon machine image in Community AMIs, and as a virtual machine image (drVM.ova) the instructions for users can be found in Supplementary file 2. drVM first placed all the HCV (485\u20132425) along with 105 liver and 274 paired-end reads into fastq files classified under the genus \u201cHepacivirus\u201d. drVM correctly classified viral reads into the corresponding genus fastq files (CA16 and HRV reads in Enterovirus and HRSV in Orthopneumovirus) drVM results for read mixture simulations of human enterovirus (CA16), human rhinovirus (HRV), human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), and reads from ERR690488. drVM produced coverage plots in analyzing metagenomics reads of 260 sequencing runs and reconstructed viral genomes from 147 runs. drVM reconstructed complete viral genomes in 25 runs. the remaining 9 runs are labeled as \u201cdetection\u201d in Table 1. drVM-produced viral sequences shared 99.9% average sequence identity to reference genomes. drVM produced coverage plots for all 82 sequencing runs. drVM assembled two hepatitis C virus genomes, 74 norovirus genomes, two human picobirnavirus genomes, and one pepino mosaic virus genome from 76 sequencing runs. over 99.98% average sequence identity was obtained when the drVM-produced sequences were compared to the 17 references. drVM produced 2 complete influenza A H1N1 virus genomes (ERR690494 and ERR690532 in http://sb.nhri.org.tw/drVM/) and 10 H3N2 virus genomes (e.g., ERR690510) in 12 influenza-positive samples and one human respiratory syncytial virus in a negative control sample (ERR690491). drVM successfully reconstructed over 200 viral genomes of 30 sDNA Human adenovirus (ERR233414), Human papillomavirus (ERR233428), ssDNA Adeno-associated virus (SRR766763), Bovine parvovirus (SRR2010686), Fox circovirus (SRR1920168), Torque teno mini virus (SRR2040553), Torque teno mini virus (SRR2010686) dsRNA Human picobirnavirus (ERR three datasets \u2013 SRR1170797, SRR1106548, and DRR049387 \u2013 used in VIP, SURPI, and VirusTAP were separately input into them for the pipeline evaluation [10, 12, 13] drVM requires the shortest execution time with regards to SRR1106548 and DRR049387. drVM produced a complete genome of bovine viral diarrhea virus (genome size: 12.5 kbp) in SRR1170797, forge.net/projects/sb2nhri/files/drVM/Comparison/. drVM reconstructed a GB virus C genome (length of 9244 bp) from 101 364 paired-end reads in fastq files of Pegivirus in SRR544883. the software managed to reconstruct the viral genome of GB virus C from the concatenated reads. the results were executed on a quad-core CPU with 128 GB RAM, except for VirusTAP (executed on a 120-core CPU with 1 TB RAM) drVM pipeline drVM was designed to detect and reconstruct known viral genomes. drVM.py contains two modules: CreateDB.py and drVM.py. the viral sequences downloaded from NCBI were processed by CreateDB.py to produce SNAP and BLAST databases. taxonomy information was also automatically extracted from NCBI. drVM.py created a folder containing assembled viral genomes (*.ctg.fa) and annotated coverage plots. each assembled contig (e.g. human papillomavirus type 45 and type 53) was annotated with its closely related genome. drVM correctly classified viral reads into genus fastq files. assembled sequences of length 7145 to 15 224 bp were 100% identical to reference genomes. drVM successfully reconstructed the three viral genomes in the two genus folders. drVM produced coverage plots in analyzing metagenomics reads of 260 sequencing runs and reconstructed viral genomes from 147 runs. drVM reconstructed viral genomes in 25 runs, thus the remaining 9 runs are labeled as \u201cdetection\u201d in Table 1. drVM-produced viral sequences shared over 99.9% average sequence identity to the reference genomes (20 pairs of reference and assembled sequence) drVM also detected hepatitis C viruses in SRR513080 (three assembled HCV contigs > 1 kbp), SRR629705 (one HCV contig > 5 kbp) and SRR629708. drVM produced coverage plots for all 82 sequencing runs. drVM assembled two hepatitis C virus genomes, 74 norovirus genomes, two human picobirnavirus genomes and one pepino mosaic virus genome from 76 sequencing runs. over 99.98% average sequence identity was obtained when the drVM-produced sequences were compared to the 17 references. bocavirus (ssDNA) genome with length of 5250 bp in SRR2010686, two segments of human picobirnavirus (dsRNA) with lengths of 2485 and 1717 bp in ERR227885, a bovine viral diarrhea virus (ssRNA positive strand) with length of 12 216 bp in SRR1170806, and a hepatitis B virus (retrovirus) genome with length of 3166 bp three datasets \u2013 SRR1170797, SRR1106548, and DRR049387 \u2013 were separately input into them for the pipeline evaluation [10, 12, 13] drVM requires the shortest execution time with regards to SRR1106548 and DRR049387. drVM, SURPI, and VIP (in Table 3) were performed on a quad-core CPU with 128 GB RAM while VirusTAP was executed on a 120-core CPU web server with 1 TB RAM. drVM reconstructed the viral genomes from metagenomics reads of SRR1170797, SRR062073, and ERR690519 runs. the other three tools were not able to produce complete genomes for these viruses. execution time increased by a factor of three (from 43 minutes to 2 hours 7 minutes while analyzing read bases of 711 Mb to 10 Gb) reads were not classified into fastq files of Pegivirus when the concatenated reads (SRR3031107 + SRR544883) were employed as inputs to drVM. it was confirmed that host read subtraction is not necessary in drVM. results were executed on a quad-core CPU with 128 GB RAM. drVM is able to run these datasets with 8 GB RAM. drVM is able to run these datasets with 8 GB RAM. viral reads with the loosest edit distance of 24 (in SNAP) were partitioned into genus-level groups based on the virus taxonomy retrieved from the NCBI taxonomy databases. the filtered reads belonging to a viral genus are therefore allowed to be divergent from reference genomes so long as there is one contiguous seed of 20 bases matching exactly to a reference. drVM annotates each genus-level assembly with a close reference to produce the corresponding coverage plots. if multiple contigs are present in one coverage plot, reads aligned to the contigs are extracted in pairs for subsequent re-assembly. drVM produced complete genomes of bovine viral diarrhea virus and human papillomavirus in the analysis of reads produced by Ion Torrent and Illumina platforms. drVM produced distinct viral genome assemblies within the same genus, for human papillomavirus types 45 and 53 in SRR062073 and for human enterovirus rhinovirus in the simulation dataset. drVM generates self-explanatory results accurately and rapidly. it also generates self-explanatory results accurately and rapidly. error can be easily identified via inspection of assembled contigs.
