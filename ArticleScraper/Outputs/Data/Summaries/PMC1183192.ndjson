{"summary": "new algorithm for assessing similarity between primer and template has been developed. results Primer sequence is converted to a vector of the full potential hydrogen numbers. template sequence is converted to a vector of the actual hydrogen bond numbers formed after primer annealing. new algorithm based on information theory. one information source was obtained by converting primer sequences to numeric vectors. the second was created as a vector of the actual hydrogen bond numbers formed between the primer and its potential binding site on the template. m and n are lengths of upstream and downstream primers. the pi and ti are defined as below. the formula for the calculation of information coefficient (I) is as equation (5). SPCR generated a product between upstream and downstream primer annealing sites within the product length range. the user inputs the primer sequences, sets the thresholds, and provides locally one or more template sequence files. the output of SPCR is a text file of a list of predicted PCR products. VPCR gave one unspecific product for the ARR7 gene and 8 unspecific products for ARR5. more than 80% of predicted products had counterparts in the laboratory PCR results. predictions for three strains yielded 1 or 2 unspecific products. in only one strain was an unspecific product found that was longer than the expected gene copy. in only one strain was an unspecific product found that was longer than the expected gene copy. annealing temperature should be greater than 0.8 if a specific PCR is predicted. if parameters higher than 9.0 still give unspecific products we suggest change of primer pairs. mismatch tolerance during primer annealing to template is the most important reason for unspecific products. the threshold can be increased to reduce expected products. this is comparable to increasing annealing temperature to reduce unspecific products in laboratory PCR. this algorithm tolerates any type of mismatch between primer and template.
