{"summary": "bi3+ compounds have been used to treat gastrointestinal infection for decades. but its mode of uptake remains unclear. we determined intracellular bismuth levels in human proximal tubular cells. the reduction of glutathione at 15 h is statistically insignificant. both human cell lines (HK-2 and ML-1) and bacterial cells (E. coli and H. pylori) were used for in-depth examination on the saturating phase of bismuth uptake. Bismuth uptake in human cell lines HK-2 and ML-1 and (B) E. coli and H. pylori all exhibited a saturating pattern. all cells were pretreated with 0.5 mM l-BSO for 24 h to deplete glutathione. HK-2 cells were first treated with 0.5 mM l-buthionine-sulfoximine (l-BSO) for 24 h to deplete GSH. HK-2 cells were then treated with 0.125, 0.25, and 0.5 mM CBS. jmax values were 0.13 0.02, 0.24 0.03, and 0.42 0.03 mM. l-BSO-treated HK-2 developed severe cell degradation and nucleus malformation upon CBS stress. l-BSO reduced the survival rate of HK-2 treated with 0.5 mM CBS. l-BSO, l-BSO and then CBS-treated HK-2 appeared normally. l-BSO plus CBS-treated HK-2 developed severe cell degradation and nucleus malformation. the cells were treated with (1) LysoTracker, (2) BiTracker and LysoTracker. the fluorescence of HK-2 and LysoTracker were colocalized (2). HK-2 underwent readily observable darkening (1) which can be diminished by MK571 (2). bismuth was repeatedly found metabolized into bismuth sulfide particles inside subcellular vesicles of many different types of mammalian cells. blue fluorescence of the probe (exited at 365 nm) were exclusively found inside subcellular vesicles at the perinuclear region of HK-2 cells. HK-2 cells cultured in cystine-supplemented medium underwent readily observable color changes after 72 h incubation with 0.5 mM CBS. the blue fluorescence found inside vacuoles did not colocalize with LysoTracker (Fig. 4D3) guanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit beta-2-like 1 (RACK1) and annexin A1 can also be used to track bismuth-binding proteins. UV radiation at 365 nm could link the probe covalently to its binding partner through arylazide. simulated values of bismuth uptake in HK-2 at different CBS doses shown. upper right is the values of bismuth permeability P at different CBS doses. HK-2 was treated with 0.5 mM CBS for different periods of time. these three functions represent the three major steps of SAPT pathway. they were further restrained by laws of material conservation of glutathione (Eq. S8) and bismuth (Eq. S9). the rise of mountain marked the activation time of glutathione\u2013MRP disposal system (36 h), concurs with the time glutathione level surges in CBS-treated HK-2 cells. as CBS dosage decreases from 0.5 to 5 104 mM, the exact P values are 0.20, 0.45, 2.54, and 1.60 h1 respectively. glutathione plays an important role in heavy metal detoxification. we conducted a toxicity test on HK-2 cells with sodium arsenite, antimony citrate, and cadmium chloride. even the SD of survival rate was found to grow along with the deviation of glutathione level during 36\u201372 h. glutathione levels in HK-2 cells increased to over fourfold the original level. time-dependent bismuth uptake and glutathione level changes in HK-2 and Escherichia coli cells treated with 0.5 mM CBS. j(t) is the amount of bismuth in cells at time t, jmax is the upper limit of bismuth uptake and P is the overall bismuth permeability (h1) of the cell. all data were fitted with Eq. 1. HK-2 cells were first treated with 0.5 mM l-buthionine-sulfoximine (l-BSO) for 24 h to deplete GSH. HK-2 cells were then treated with 0.125, 0.25, and 0.25 mM CBS to yield time-dependent bismuth uptake curves. jmax values were 0.13 0.02, 0.24 0.03, and 0.42 0.03 mM. the uptake of CBS is mainly a process of passive transport when the concentration of CBS is between 0.1 and 1 mM. the permeability of CBS uptake in HK-2 and ML-1 cells are also comparable to the rate constant (k) of GSH consumption. l-BSO depleted glutathione from HK-2 cells. l-BSO reduced survival rate of HK-2 treated with 0.5 mM CBS. l-BSO and CBS-treated HK-2 developed severe cell degradation. in l-BSO-treated HK-2, cells developed severe vacuolation with blue fluorescence inside vacuoles. the characteristic emission and 94% of bismuth was only found in black particle. bismuth level in l-BSO\u2013pretreated HK-2 was 0.05 mM. bismuth level in HK-2 was 35 mM, four- to fivefold higher than HK-2 without supplement (8.3 mM) the pellet was then dissolved in 50% HNO3 before examining bismuth content. all fluorescent signal of BiTracker was detected in the pellet. biTracker was also found colocalized with LysoTracker Red DND-99. cells were incubated with 0.5 mM CBS for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. proteins with expression level change >twofold were harvested for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight-mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS) protein identification. ic glutathione activated its de novo biosynthesis, which in return facilitated passive uptake of bismuth. they constitute a self-sustaining positive feedback circle, which we named sequestration-aided passive transport. HK-2 was treated with 0.5 mM CBS for different periods of time. this metabolic network in SAPT can be described by five simple rules. first, the binding of bismuth and glutathione is governed by law of mass action. third, due to feedback inhibition of GSH on -glutamylcysteine synthetase (-GCS) the rise of plateau is the result of the concentration difference of bismuth across cell membrane, which triggered the initial uptake. the rise of plateau is the result of the activation time of glutathione\u2013MRP disposal system (36 h), concurs with the time glutathione level surges in HK-2 cells. j1 equals j2 and generates parametric equations describing a curve in three-dimensional space (Eq. S11), the ridge. to the upper left of the ridge, bismuth uptake rate is limited by glutathione supply. in this case, the bismuth uptake rate is mainly controlled by glutathione supply. absorption is mediated by glutathione and multidrug resistant protein in human cells. previous experiments showed bismuth was metabolized into bismuth\u2013sulfur particles in subcellular vesicles of different cells. glutathione sequestration facilitates passive uptake of bismuth. cells exhibited higher permeability at smaller CBS doses. annexin A1 itself is a pivotal inhibitor of inflammation. tion dramatically reduced bismuth uptake and compartmentalization, and the survival rate of cells under bismuth stress. pathology is similar to bismuth-treated H. pylori and Giardia lamblia. the BL21 strain of E. coli was cultured at 37 \u00b0C in LB. H. pylori strain 26695 was grown on agar containing 7% (vol/vol) horse blood in microaerobic environment at 37 \u00b0C for 3 d."}
