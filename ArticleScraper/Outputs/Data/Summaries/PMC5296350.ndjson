{"summary": "enterovirus 68 (EV-D68) is an emerging pathogen that can cause severe respiratory disease and is associated with cases of paralysis. it was first isolated from samples obtained in California in 1962 from four children with pneumonia and bronchiolitis. over the past 10 years, EV-D68 infection outbreaks have been reported in Italy, the united states, Germany, China, and several other countries. EV-D68 is acid labile and biologically more similar to human rhinoviruses that are associated with respiratory diseases. many viruses facilitate their own replication by interacting with host factors that regulate cell cycle progression. some small DNA viruses including simian virus 40 (DeCaprio et al., 1988), adenovirus (Howe et al., 1990), and human papillomavirus (Werness et al., 1990) replicate in the human EV-A71 and Coxsackievirus A16 manipulate the host cell cycle at S phase in order to promote their own viral replication. the potential manipulation of the host cell cycle by EV-D68 has not been previously characterized. EV-D68 replication is integrally associated with the host cell cycle. RD cells were seeded and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h in 96-well plates. virus-containing supernatant was serially diluted 10-fold. cytopathic effect was observed once per day. after EV-D68 virus infection, fresh 10% DMEM was added to release the cells from G0/G1. subconfluent cultures of RD cells were synchronized in G0/G1 phase by serum deprivation for 24 h. for sustained S and G2/M cell-cycle arrest after virus infection, cells were treated with fresh 0.85 mM thymidine and 25 ng/ml nocodazole. anti-CDK2 (Cell Signal), anti-cyclinE1 (Proteintech), anti-CDK4 (Cell Signal), anti-CDK6 (Cell Signal), anti-cyclinD (Cell Signal), anti-CDK1 (Boster), anti-cyclinB1 (Santa Cruz), and anti-histone (GenScript).

RD cells were purchased from the ATCC (Manassas, VA, USA) and used according to a previous study. RD cells were seeded and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h in 96-well plates. cytopathic effect was observed once per day. 5 105 cells were plated in a 6-well plate and maintained in serum-free medium for 24 h. fresh 10% DMEM was added to release the cells from G0/G1. subconfluent cultures of RD cells were synchronized in G0/G1 phase by serum deprivation for 24 h. anti-CDK2 (Cell Signal), anti-cyclinE1 (Proteintech), anti-CDK4 (Cell Signal), anti-CDK6 (Cell Signal), anti-cyclinD (Cell Signal), anti-CDK1 (Boster), anti-cyclinB1 (Santa Cruz), and anti-histone (GenScript). the fold changes were calculated relative to GAPDH using the Ct method. the primer for real time PCR and plasmid construct. the microplate was quantified using a microplate reader (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) target protein expression was normalized to the histone expression. RD cells were cultured in either serum medium (control) or serum-free medium (G0/G1 synchronization) for 24 h. the cells were infected with the same titer of 0.8 MOI of EV-D68. serum deprivation induced obvious G0/G1 arrest. Flow diagram of how RD cells were treated with serum starvation (starved) for G0/G1 synchronization (A), with thymidine (thymi) for S synchronization (E), or with nocodazole (noco) for G2/M synchronization (I) the top diagram in each panel shows the strategy for cell cycle synchronization. the cells were cultured in medium or were synchronized in S phase by culture with 0.85 mM thymidine for 24 h. fresh culture medium or 0.85 mM thymidine was added for another 24 h. the genomic RNA level remained similar in S phase-synchronized cells. EV-D68 infection manipulates the host cell cycle and arrests cells at G0/G1 phase. RD cells were infected with EV-D68 Fermon stain at an MOI of 0.8. EV-D68 itself can manipulate the host cell to accumulate preferentially at G0/G1 phase rather than at G2/M. the virulence of Fermon, US/KY/14-18953 and US/MO/14-18947strains in infected RD cells was assessed 24 h post-infection with virus at MOI 0.8. the results represent the mean S.D of three independent experiments. RD cells were infected with the currently circulating strains of EV-D68. they were then mock-infected or infected with EV-D68 Fermon strain for 2 h. the cells were then stimulated with 10% FBS in order to trigger cell cycle re-entry into S phase. EV-D68 infection prevents cell exit from G0/G1 into S phase and promotes G2/M to G0/G1 transition. RD cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then mock-infected (mock) or infected with EV-D68 Fermon strain at an MOI of 0.8 (i) for 0, 16, 20, 24, and 28 h. RD cells were treated with 25 ng/mL nocodazole or control medium for 24 h. infected with EV-D68 Fermon strain at an MOI of 0.8 or mock for 2 h. then re-treated with 25 ng/mL nocodazole for synchronization. proteins by Western blotting of RD cells at 0, 16, 20, 24, and 28 h post-infection. EV-D68 infection inhibits host expression of several cell cycle proteins. RD cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h for G2/M phase synchronization. EV-D68 infection also regulates cell cycle by promoting exit from G2/M phase. expression of cyclinB1 and CDK1 was down regulated by EV-D68 infection. cyclinB1 was decreased at the mRNA level upon EV-D68 infection. induced G0/G1 arrest, with an increase in the percentage of G0/G1 cells from 39.37 0.52% to 44.76 1.29% (13.69% increase; P 0.01) and a corresponding increase in the G0/G1\u2013G2/M ratio from 2.02 0.04 to 2.62 0.18. the extent of the increase in the percentage of G0/G1 cells was dependent on the dose of 3D vector (0, 0.5, 1, 2 g; R = 0.9 the expression of cell cycle-related proteins after transfection of 293T cells with 3D, 3C or corresponding vector (mock) was assessed by Western blot analysis at 36 h. the results indicate the mean S.D of three independent experiments. 3C down-regulated the expression of CDK1 and cyclinB1. non-structural protein 3C facilitates exit from G2/M. non-structural protein 3D mediates arrest in G0/G1. TCID50/mL for EV-A71 was 489.37 times lower for G0/G1 phase-synchronized cells than for control cells. RD cells were serum-starved for 48 h to synchronize cells in G0/G1 phase. the effects of synchronization by starvation were assessed. G2/M-phase synchronization has similar effects on different strains of EV-D68 and EV-A71. cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h. they were then treated at 0.8 MOI for 2 h and treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole. RD cells were infected with EV-D68 strains US/KY/14-18953 or EV-A71. RD cells were treated with 2 M Pseudolaric acid B (PAB) for 24 h. results are standardized by GAPDH mRNA as a control. RD cells were infected with EV-D68 US/KY/14-18953 strain or EV-A71. PAB decreased the genomic RNA levels of both EV-D68 and EV-A71 strains. this suggests a common approach for therapeutic intervention. serum medium or serum-free medium was added for another 24 h. at 2 h post-infection, the EV-D68 genomic RNA levels were not significantly different in the control and serum-starved cells. at 18 h post infection, 13.55 times more viral RNA was detected in the serum-starved cells than in the control cells. thymidine (thymi) for S synchronization (E), or with nocodazole (noco) for G2/M synchronization (I) the top diagram in each panel shows the strategy for cell cycle synchronization. the bottom panel shows the strategy for cell cycle synchronization. fresh culture medium or 0.85 mM thymidine was added for another 24 h. genomic RNA level remained similar in S phase-synchronized cells. TCID50/mL values at 24 h post-infection were equivalent for control cells. EV-D68 infection manipulates the host cell cycle and arrests cells at G0/G1. RD cells were infected with EV-D68 Fermon stain at an MOI of 0.8. EV-D68 itself can manipulate the host cell to accumulate preferentially at G0/G1 phase rather than at G2/M. the virulence of RD cells in infected RD cells was assessed 24 h post-infection with virus at an MOI of 0.8 for 24 h. the results represent the mean S.D of three independent experiments. RD cells were synchronized in G0/G1 by serum starvation for 24 h. then mock-infected or infected with EV-D68 Fermon strain for 2 h. the cells were then stimulated with 10% FBS in order to trigger cell cycle re-entry into S phase from G0/G1 into S phase. EV-D68 infection prevents cell exit from G0/G1 into S phase. RD cells were serum-starved for 24 h and then mock-infected (mock) or infected with EV-D68 Fermon strain (infected) at an MOI of 0.8. after 2 h of virus adsorption, the cells were treated with medium without FBS for 18 h. azole or control medium for 24 h, infected with EV-D68 Fermon strain at an MOI of 0.8 or mock for 2 h and then re-treated with 25 ng/mL nocodazole for synchronization. results are representative of three independent experiments. EV-D68 infection inhibits host expression of several cell cycle proteins. RD cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h. the cells were mock infected or infected with EV-D68 at 0.8 MOI for 2 h. h, the percentage of cells in G2/M was decreased (21.82 1.07 vs. 35.91 1.44; P 0.001), and the percentage of cells in G0/G1 was increased (48.59 1.22 vs. 32.51 0.21; P 0.01). EV-D68 infection also regulates cell cycle by promoting exit from G2/M phase. the extent of the increase in the percentage of G0/G1 cells was dependent on the dose of 3D vector (0, 0.5, 1, 2 g; R = 0.932; P 0.001). the non-structural protein 3D of EV-D68 contributes to G0/G1 arrest. 293T cells with 3D, 3C or corresponding vector (mock) were assessed by Western blot analysis at 36 h. we also examined the potential role of non-structural protein 3C in cell cycle regulation by EV-D68. structural protein 3C facilitates exit from G2/M. non-structural protein 3D mediates arrest in G0/G1. EV-D68 (serotype HEV-D) and EV-A71 (serotype HEV-A) both enteroviruses. RD cells were serum-starved for 48 h to synchronize cells in G0/G1 phase. the effects of synchronization by starvation were assessed. the results represent the mean S.D of three independent experiments. synchronization with nocodazole has been shown to inhibit both the EV-D68 Fermon strain in this study. cells were treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole or medium for 24 h. they were then treated at 0.8 MOI for 2 h and treated with 25 ng/ml nocodazole. RD cells were infected with EV-D68 strains US/KY/14-18953 or EV-A71 at an MOI of 0.8 for 2 h. RD cells were treated with 2 M Pseudolaric acid B (PAB) for 24 h for G2/M synchronization. PAB was confirmed to promote G2/M arrest after 24 h. RD cells were infected with EV-D68 US/KY/14-18953 strain or EV-A71. PAB decreased the genomic RNA levels of both EV-D68 and EV-A71. EV-D68 arrest promotes EV-D68 replication without affecting virus entry. we also assessed the effects of S phase and G2/M phase synchronization on viral production. this suggests that G0/G1 phase is most favorable for EV-D68 replication. EV-D68 infection promotes cell cycle transition from G2/M into G0/G1 phase. cyclinD, CDK4, CDK6, cyclinE1 and CDK2 are down-regulated after EV-D68 infection. this could explain the ability of EV-D68 to inhibit the transition from G0/G1 to S phase. expression of cell cycle-related proteins further supports results suggesting that EV-D68 induces G0/G1 arrest by regulating G0/G1 phase entry and exit. we also analyzed whether the regulation of protein expression occurred at the mRNA level, but that the other cell cycle proteins were not. both EV-A71 and EV-D68 belong to the Picornaviridae family. this difference is surprising given that both EV-A71 and EV-D68 belong to the Picornaviridae family. this difference is surprising given that both viruses belong to the Picornaviridae family. nocodazole inhibited the replication and virulence of EV-D68 and EV-A71. nocodazole also inhibited the production of EV-D68 and EV-A71."}
