{"summary": "pigeonpea is one of the major grain legume (pulse) crops in the Indian subcontinent. the crop is known to be susceptible to a few virus and virus-like pathogens, belonging to different genera [1\u20134] 2 to 3 monocistronic genomic dsRNA segments are encapsulated individually. dsRNAs eluted from the agarose gel were purified and used as templates for RT-PCR amplification employed in SISPA to generate full-length cDNAs. RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) structurally resembles the known RdRp of the dsRNA bacteriophage -6, reovirus, or with other viruses like calciviruses and picornaviruses [12\u201316] their structural details are larger than RdRp of ArCV-1. SISPA Symptomless pigeonpea leaf samples contain four dsRNA species with an estimated size of 1.71, 1.49, 1.43 and 1.6 kb. as symptomless leaf sample (Mg-H3) collected from another field (MG-3) were devoid of similar dsRNAs. the pure dsRNAs yield ranged 700 to 800 ng was obtained from 7g of fresh leaves with consistent dsRNA unique profile. the larger RNA was identified putative RdRp encoding a single peptide of P1. the two smaller RNAs encode two individual peptides of P2 and P3. dsRNA-2A (Black solid line) is predicted to encode a putative coat protein P4 marked as grey box. ArCV-1 RNAs encoding capsid proteins are conserved in the last three nt (TTC) the majority of the Deltapartitiviruses contain RNA segments consistently ending with nucleotides TC except in Rosa multiflora cryptic virus (RmCV) and CanCV (Betapartitivirus) the dsRNA-1 (HG797710) is 1,714 nt long, containing a single open reading frame (ORF) between nt 1,606 and nt 179. P1 protein was identified as viral RdRp and contains conserved short amino acid sequence motifs (A to G) which are essential for viral replication. motifs GWARS (53\u201357), STPD (162\u2013165), TRTQL (168\u2013172) are present in N-terminus and RDE (397\u2013399), CLRML (402\u2013406), LRA (421\u2013423), DAG (429\u2013431) YLY (436\u2013438) and WDP (460\u2013462) in the C-terminus devoid of predicted active residues. motif C represented by GDD sequence has been described as the center of catalytic activity of the RdRp in all RdRp classes [18, 28]. the 3D structural analysis revealed that the GDD sequence present in the loop formed by antiparallel \u2013sheets 6 and 7 is located in the bottom part of the central cavity of the molecule in the palm region (Fig 4B, S2A Fig) deltapartitivirus has 72.4% amino acid sequence identity with FcCV P1, 71.2% with RmCV P1 and percent sequence identity of 71.0 to 12.1% with the P1 proteins of other tripartite viruses. the 3\u2019-terminus contained the sequence GCACCCGTCTC. dsRNA genomic segments of ArCV -1 with tripartite and bipartite cryptic viruses. dsRNA-2 (HG967639) is 1,491nt long, with single ORF (nt 207 to 1253) of a 38.5 kDa protein with 348 amino acids (P2). d protein-1 has 40.6% amino acid sequence identity with corresponding protein of RsCV-1- (EU024677) the dsRNA-3 (HG967638) is 1,433 nt long, containing a single ORF between nt 171 and 1,205 with 170- and 227nt long 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 NTRs. the dsRNA-2A (HG917912), extracted along with the ArCV-1 genome was found in lower concentration in comparison to the ic virus (CiLCV; KC429583), 34.4% with PepCV-1 (JN117277) and 26.0% PepCV-2 (JN117279). dsRNA-2A coat protein like sequence belong to a yet unknown second cryptovirus infecting pigeonpea. RNA-2 showed 34% sequence identity with unknown protein (XP008459635) of Cucumis melo. dsRNA-2A shared 34% sequence identity with uncharacterized proteins KOM46435 and XP017431256 of Vigna angularis. eukaryotic lineages are not known host plants for cryptic viruses. the partitivirus genome is devoid of 5\u2019 terminus genome-linked protein (Vpg) or particularly the polymerase with polyadenylated C\u2019- terminal. the coiled structure runs across, connecting the fingers and the thumb subdomains, folds back on itself into a loop providing the conserved residues GWARS (53\u201357) seem to be unique to the bi- and tripartite. the fingers subdomain (residues 56\u2013232 and 252\u2013309) consist of eight -helices (2 to 7 and 9, 10) and four -strands (1\u20142 and 4-5) broad structural variations are seen in fingers subdomain followed by the thumb in general. the fingers region contains motif F and motif G, the latter being geometrically closer to the catalytic center of the palm subdomain. motif G is highly conserved in cryptoviral RdRps. glycine and lysine seem to be a strict requirement of motif G. residues of motif G contact nucleic acid at its 5\u2019 template overhang. palm domain consists of three -sheets (-3, -6, -7) sandwiched between helices -11 and -12 and a long loop from -12 connecting -13 in the thumb. a close structural alignment was noticed between ArCV-1 and Sapovirus (SV) and Norwalk virus (NV) (+ssRNA) RdRps. I 0.886 2.23 12.5 5 Foot-and-mouth diseasevirus (FMDV) 1WNE 0.837 2.62 13.2 Rank = Template modeling score, is a measure of sequence identity between two protein structures. RMSD = Root mean square deviation represents the differences in sample standard deviation between predicted values and observed values. motif A consists of conserved residues present between the -sheet 3 running into -helix 8. the RdRp contained active residues D242, F246 and D247 are conserved in motif A of several picornaviruses. glycine residue in 3Dpol abolished RNA synthesis in vitro. the high sequence and structural conservation of the B-loop among viral RdRps have been reported. asparagine residue played a vital role in RNA elongation in picornavirus elongation complexes. the residue appears to be substituted by glycine (G314), present at the same position in the -11. dsRNA cryptovirus RdRps exist in phage -6 motif B (Gly403). glycine at position 297 leaves sufficiently a large pocket for an additional water molecule. glycine may substitute for asparagine 297 by allowing a water molecule to become the hydrogen bonding partner for the NTP. the presence of the second aspartate almost is universal in GDD motif. but any substitutions made in the second aspartate were not tolerated in poliovirus RdRp [35, 58], suggesting that the requirements for this position may be more strict. the central conserved region of the RdRp was located in the central cavity or close by. lysine373 along with serene is conserved in this motif. lysine seems to be sustained in the sequence of motif D of all RdRps. the conserved sequence at amino acids position 384 to 388 (TFLSR) was detected in the ArCV-1 3Dpol at the mentioned location -helix turn -helix. there was variation in the amino acid T384 position in the cryptovirus primary sequence (S1 Fig) as well as in picornaviruses. the small size of the domain contributes to the formation of a large central cleft [45], which leads to the active site shown in the surface representation of the molecule. the thumb subdomain of these cryptoviruses contained four -helices (---) on the contrary FcCV thumb had an extra helix making total thumb -helices to five (------) the thumb C-terminus helix (-16) was protruded out away from central cavity like other cryptoviruses except in case of RsCV-1 (Alphapartitivirus) the helix (-16) extends in to a compact tuft of coil packs against the front face of the molecule. different genera of picornaviruses showed high template modeling (TM) score with ArCV-1 3D pol; NV (0.898) [68], SV (0.898) [69],Rabbit hemorrhagic disease virus (RHDV) (0.895) [70], all members of the family Caliciviridae. structural details are available in PDB archives which doesn\u2019t have the information on the RdRps of cryptic viruses to compare. dsRNA-1 and dsRNA-2A sequences were used in the phylogenetic analysis. a high degree of alignment was noticed in the palm region. a high degree of alignment was noticed in the palm region. a high degree of alignment was noticed in the palm region. the findings further support the hypothesis that dsRNA-2A does not belong to the tripartite ArCV-1. arCV-1 RNA-1 clusters with tripartite members of the genus deltapartitivirus. the pure dsRNAs yielded 700 to 800 ng from 7g of fresh leaves. dsRNAs were cloned and characterized using agarose gel. dsRNA-2A is predicted to encode a putative coat protein P4 marked as grey box. BLAST analyses of the full-length sequences revealed their identity with the orthologs of several cryptoviruses. dsRNA-2A, 5\u2019-terminus sequence (AGAATTTGCCCTGTAT) did not share the conserved sequences. the majority of the Deltapartitiviruses contain RNA segments consistently ending with nucleotides TC except in Rosa multiflora cryptic virus (RmCV) and Cannabis cryptic virus (Betapartitivirus) the 3\u2019 termini, each with a poly (A) tract. the dsRNA-1 (HG797710) is 1,714 nt long, containing a single open reading frame (ORF) between nt 1,606 and nt 179 with 178- and 108-nt- long 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 NTRs. this ORF encodes for a 55.34 kDa protein (P1) containing 475 amino acids. active residues in motif G are comparatively well conserved in the dsRNA cryptovirus RdRps (S1 Fig) active residues in motif G are comparatively well conserved in the dsRNA cryptovirus RdRps (S1 Fig) the GDD sequence present in the loop formed by antiparallel \u2013sheets 6 and 7 is located in the bottom part of the central cavity of the molecule in the palm region. the first aspartate is an essential residue of this highly conserved motif for the enzyme activity and its coordination in the binding of a magnesium ion that would be part of the rNTP binding site. the 3\u2019-terminus contained the sequence GCACCCGTCTC. the 3\u2019-terminus contained the sequence GCACCCGTCTC. the folding topology resembles the RdRps of picornaviruses. dsRNA-2 (HG967639) is 1,491nt long, with a single ORF (nt 207 to 1253) of a 38.5 kDa protein with 348 amino acids (P2) dsRNA-3 (HG967638) is 1,433 nt long, containing a single ORF between nt 171 and 1,205 with 170- and 227. the RNA is 1,608 nt long, contains a single ORF that encodes a 44.5 kDa protein (P4) of 389 amino acids. the ORF starts at nt. 85 and terminates at 1,254 nt (Fig 2B, Table 1) with 84- and 353-nts as the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019- NTRs. dsRNA-2A coat protein like sequence belong to a yet unknown second cryptovirus infecting pigeonpea. it is hard to explain, in absence of a related RdRp gene, and to speculate that the dsRNA-2A coat protein like sequence belong to a yet unknown second cryptovirus. dsRNA-2A shared 34% sequence identity with ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter F family member-1 found conserved in eukaryotes and prokaryotes. these eukaryotic lineages are not the known host plants for cryptic viruses. the N-terminal residues (1\u201355) in fingers subdomain extend over to the thumb subdomain binding them together encircling the molecule. this architecture makes the molecule spherical or globular (Fig 4A and 4C), and not U shape normally seen in DNA polymerases and DNA-dependent RNA polymerases. the fingers region contains motif F and motif G. the thumb is geometrically closer to the catalytic center of the palm subdomain. motif G is not present in the highly conserved motif G of tripartite cryptoviruses (FcCV, RmCV, RoCV-1, and RsCV-2) including arCV-1. the residues of motif G contact the nucleic acid at its 5\u2019 template overhang and form part of the channel for the template strand. the palm domain shows the maximum conservation in the conserved motifs A, B, C, D and E. it has been shown to play different roles in the catalytic activity of the enzyme. ArCV-1 RdRp sequence identity with cryptoviruses is high, like the structural alignment. template modeling score, is a measure of sequence identity between two protein structures with different tertiary structures. RMSD = Root mean square deviation represents the differences in sample standard deviation between predicted values and observed values. motif A consists of conserved residues present between the -sheet 3 running into -helix 8. the RdRp contained active residues D242, F246 and D247. gly306 residue acts as axis for conformational changes, highlighted in green block. gly306 residue acts as axis for conformational changes. gly306 residue acts as axis for conformational changes. motif B takes part in template binding, incoming nucleotide recognition [39] and determining whether RNA or DNA will be synthesized by selecting rNTPs and dNTPs. asparagine residue thought to be playing vital role in its functioning. rase can be substituted for asparagine 297 by allowing a water molecule to become the hydrogen bonding partner for the NTP 2\u2032OH. a glycine at position 297 leaves sufficiently a pocket for an additional water molecule. this results attest to the extreme evolutionary flexibility of the viral RdRp. substitutions made in the second aspartate were not tolerated as reported in poliovirus RdRp [35, 58], suggesting that the requirements for this position may be more strict [59], with some RdRps to function. active residues in motif D have been postulated to play critical roles in catalysis. lysine seems to be sustained in the sequences of motif D of all RdRps. lysine seems to be sustained in the sequences of motif D. the hydrophobic L386 residue of this motif was found to be active residue. it interacts with elements of -sheets of the palm core structure. a double mutant K375A/R376A of the same virus was found to abolish replication in vivo. arCV-1, 3Dpol appears to be having similar central cavity architecture and dimensions with FMDV, PV and HRV-16. the main structural differences between RdRps of ArCV-1 and the closely related FcCV and RoCV-1, RmCV, RsCV-2 (Deltapartitivirus) are in the thumb region. the thumb C-terminus observed in ArCV-1 3Dpol was protruded out away from central cavity. the helix (-16) extends in to a compact tuft of coil packs against the front face. the phage Phi6 pol C-terminal extends back ploughing parts of it through the molecule. hagic disease virus (RHDV) (0.895) [70], all members of the family Caliciviridae. FMDV (0.834) [33], EMCV (0.830) [71] and Poliovirus (0.823) [39]. structural details are available in PDB archives which doesn\u2019t have the information on the RdRps of cryptic viruses to compare. Phylogenetic analysis BLAST analysis involving several tripartite cryptoviruses revealed that the ArCV-1 genome shared a low level of identity with the orthologs. a high degree of sequence homology between the ArCV-1 5\u2019NTR sequences of the three genome segments was noticed while lacking decipherable identity in the 3\u2019proximal un-translated regions. phylogenetically though all members originate from common ancestor as they diverge from a single clade formed five distinct groups corresponding to their genera. members of group 1 and 2 clustered separately but originate from common point, which is different from other groups. phylogeny of dsRNA-2A revealed close relationship with members of the genus deltapartitivirus. arCV-1, dsRNA-1 clustered with tripartite RoCV-1, FCV and FcCV and with members of the genus. dsRNA-2A (P4 protein) displays its proximity with bipartite PepCV-2 and RsCV-3. the bar represents base substitution per site. dsRNAs of different partitiviruses from NCBI database were used in the analysis. dsRNA-2A encodes 44.5kDa protein (P4), which was found in least concentration, is not known. dsRNA-2A encodes 44.5kDa protein (P4) which was found in least concentration, is not known. the origin of P4 is related to Partitiviridae, but we have no evidence that it may interact with ArCV-1 in its replicative cycle. at least seven conserved signature motifs were aligned with the RdRps of picornaviruses ssRNA (+) that led us to examine the structural similarity, if any, of ArCv-1 3Dpol with known RdRps in further detail. the 3Dpol structures of norwalk virus, Poliovirus and Sapporo virus produced identical 3D structures in our computer analysis. the overall topology of the ArCV-1 RdRp structure resembles the general description of the three-dimensional structures of the primer dependent initiating single stranded RNA (+) RdRps. the polymerase has no structural alignment with other dsRNA, bacteriophage -6, reovirus and IBDV which have larger RdRp molecules with complex dense subdomain structures. the unique feature noticed in ArCV-1 RdRp is an N-terminal portion of the fingers reaches to the thumb bridging the fingers and thumb subdomains [43] highly conserved stretches of sequence motifs of ArCV-1 in the N-terminus to the central region have been identified uniquely to cryptic virus RdRps. motifs 1 and 2 are observed in the RdRp sequence away from the palm subdomain could play a role in catalysis. asn residue (Asn307 in FMDV) of motif B plays a role in differentiating between dNTPs and rNTPs. asparagine residue is highly conserved in the long helix, about 6.6 away from the active aspartate of the catalytic center. viral RdRps have specific structural elaborations that function to stabilize the initiation complex. in the second mechanism, the primer-dependent initiation requires the use of either an oligonucleotide or a protein primer to provide the hydroxyl nucleophile. members of the Picornaviridae family use exclusively the protein-primed mechanism. the second group to adopt de novo initiation are the dsRNA viruses. dsRNA viruses are cystoviral bacteriophage -6 [12], IBDV (family Birnavirdae), [14, 77], and reovirus (family Reoviridae) by contrast, very little is known about the mechanisms underlying dsRNA cryptovirus replication as the polymerases have never been studied. several highly conserved stretches of sequence motifs have been identified that seem unique to cryptic virus RdRp. motifs 1\u20132 observed in the RdRp sequence away from the palm subdomain are inimitable and observed in both bi- and tripartite cryptoviruses. leaf samples were designated as Mg-H1, Mg-H2 and Mg-H3 respectively. leaf samples were placed in ziplock bags placed in ice chest with dry ice. no
