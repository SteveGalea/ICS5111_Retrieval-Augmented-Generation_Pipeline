{"summary": "alpha, beta, gamma, and delta coVs carry a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of 30 kb and are classified into four genera: alpha, beta, gamma, and delta. the MERS-CoV (MERS-CoV), a beta coV, emerged in 2012 (1) and has spread to several other countries in the Middle East, North Africa, Europe, and Asia. acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV), a beta CoV, uses a two-pronged strategy to inhibit host gene expression. it inhibits protein synthesis by inactivating the translational function of the 40S subunit. nsp1 of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an alpha CoV, inhibits host protein synthesis without binding to the 40S subunit or inducing host mRNA degradation. mRNAs that are cytoplasmic in origin, including mERS-CoV mRNAs, escape the inhibitory effects of MERS-CoV nsp1. we propose this property of MERS-CoV nsp1 to distinguish between cellular and viral mRNAs. a plasmid, pCAGGS-CD26-BlasticidinR, expressing the blasticidin resistance gene and the MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) was generated by replacing the coding region of RVFV Gn/Gc gene in pCAGGS-bla-G (26) with the human DPP4 gene from pcDL-SR296 (27) 293 cells cell extracts were prepared in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) sample buffer. total RNAs were extracted, treated with DNase I, and subjected to Northern blot analysis with digoxigenin-labeled antisense rLuc RNA probe. in vitro RNA transcription, RNA transfection, and RNA electroporation. 293 cells were transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts. the cells were starved for 30 min in methionine-deficient medium. the cells were labeled with 20 Ci of Tran35S-label for 1 h. lysates were prepared in a lysis buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, 100 mM KCl, 1% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, 2 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.5 mg of heparin/l. cells were transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA transcripts using the TransIT-mRNA reagent in PBS containing 0.5% Triton X-100 for 15 min, blocked with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin for 30 min. the cells were examined under a Zeiss LSM 510 UV META laser scanning confocal microscope. at 18 h p.i., the cell suspension was prepared and frozen at 80\u00b0C. 293 cells were electroporated with RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD proteins. cDNAs were synthesized using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) and an rNase-free DNase I. RT-PCR was performed using a bio-Rad CFX96 real-time PCR apparatus. PCR conditions were as follows: preincubation at 95\u00b0C for 30 s and amplification with 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 20 s. pCAGGS-MERS-CoV-nsp1-CD and pcDNA-MERS-CoV-nsp1-CD were generated from pCAGGS-MERS-CoV-nsp1 and pcDNA-MERS-nsp1-CD. 293 cells were transfected with pCAGGS-CD26-BlasticidinR. expression of human DPP4 in 293/DPP4 cells was confirmed by Western 293 cells, grown in 24-well plates, were cotransfected in triplicate with various combinations of plasmids (1 g total) using the TransIT-293 reagent (Mirus) at 24 h posttransfection, cell lysates were prepared and subjected to Renilla luciferase (rLuc) reporter activity assays. in vitro RNA transcription, RNA transfection, and RNA electroporation. the mERS-CoV subgenomic mRNA 8-like RNA transcript was synthesized from the PCR product by using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 in vitro transcription kit. 293 cells were transfected with in vitro-synthesized RNA transcripts using the TransIT mRNA reagent (Mirus, Madison, WI) MERS-CoV-infected 293/DPP4 cells were radiolabeled with 75 Ci of Tran35S-label/ml for 1 h at 18, 24, or 30 h postinfection (p.i.) the gels were visualized by autoradiography, and the band intensities in the selected regions of the gel were determined by densitometric scanning of the autoradiographs. cells were transfected with in vitro-transcribed RNA transcripts. the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline. at 16 h after transfection, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 20 min. the pellets were incubated in buffer 2 (25 mM HEPES [pH 7.9], 5 mM KCl, 0.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, and 0.25% NP-40 supplemented with a protease inhibitor cocktail) after centrifugation, the pellets were collected and designated the nuclear fractions (28). essentially, the same method was used to prepare the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions from cells expressing M total cellular RNAs were extracted from VLP-infected cells by using TRIzol LS reagent (Invitrogen) and treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) cDNAs were synthesized using superScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) and an rLuc gene-specific primer, 5\u2032-TTATTGTTCATTTTTGAGAGAACTCGC-3\u2032, for the quantification of rLuc mRNA. MERS-CoV replication in 293/DPP4 cells induced a strong inhibition of host protein synthesis and host mRNA stability in virus-infected cells. nsp1 exerts these inhibitory effects on host gene expression in virus-infected cells. transfected 293 cells with RNA transcripts encoding CAT, MERS-CoV nsp1 or SARS-CoV nsp1 proteins were incubated in the absence or absence of ActD from 1 h p.i. cells were incubated either in the presence or absence of ActD from 1 h p.i. 293 cells were transfected with RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1 and MERS-CoV nsp1-CD proteins. extent of inhibition induced by SARS-CoV nsp1 was stronger than that induced by MERS-CoV nsp1. at 1 and 9 h posttransfection, intracellular RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis. cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Ren-EMCV-FF and the plasmid expressing CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD. the nsp1-expression plasmids encoded proteins carrying the C-terminal myc tag nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp1 expression caused a reduction in the levels of GAPDH and -actin mRNAs. nsp1 induces an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage at the 5\u2032 region of capped host mRNAs, as well as within the type I and II picornavirus internal ribosome entry sites (IRES) expression plasmids encoding CAT or SARS-CoV nsp1 were used in place of MERS-CoV nsp1. expression plasmids were extracted at 24 h posttransfection and subjected to Northern blot analysis. cell extracts were also prepared at 24 h posttransfection and subjected to rLuc reporter assay. the surface of nsp1 retained its ability to inhibit translation but lacked the endonucleolytic RNA cleavage function. alanine substitutions of these two charged amino acids would abolish the ability of MERS-CoV nsp1 to induce endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. alanine substitutions of these two charged amino acids would similarly abolish the ability of MERS-CoV nsp1 to induce endonucleolytic mRNAs in presence of ActD suggest that MERS-CoV nsp1-CD lacked the ability to induce the degradation of preexisting host mRNAs. these data point toward MERS-CoV nsp1-induced mRNA cleavage as the trigger that results in mRNA degradation. we first examined the subcellular localization of MERS-CoV nsp1 in transfected cells. the distribution of MERS-CoV nsp1 in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of transfected cells expressing nsp1 was in marked contrast to the localization of SARS-CoV nsp1 exclusively in the cytoplasm. 293 cells were mock transfected (Mock) or transfected with a plasmid encoding the C-terminal myc-tagged MERS-CoV nsp1 (MERS-CoV nsp1) or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD (MERS-CoV nsp1-CD) at 18 h posttransfection, cell lysates were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. each fraction was the asterisks represent a host protein with a slower migration than nsp1 in the gel that is recognized nonspecifically by the anti-MERS-CoV-nsp1 peptide antibody. the subcellular distribution of MERS-CoV nsp1 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus prompted us to investigate whether MERS-CoV nsp1 also targets RNAs transcribed by nuclear RNA polymerase I (Pol III) a minor band migrating below the Pol III-driven transcript was also observed in a published study using the same plasmid (21). the source of this band is unknown. MERS-CoV nsp1 targets translationally competent pol II-transcribed mRNAs for degradation. SARS-CoV nsp1 targets translating mRNAs for mRNA cleavage and translation inhibition by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit (14). mERS-CoV nsp1 strongly associated with the 40S subunit as demonstrated by the cosedimentation of SARS-CoV nsp1 with the 40S peak. 293 cells were transfected with plasmid encoding CAT, MERS-CoV nsp1, or SARS-CoV nsp1-CD. transfected with plasmid encoding rLuc gene and assayed for luciferase reporter activity at 24 h posttransfection. nsp1 strongly inhibited the reporter gene activity and induced the degradation of rLuc mRNA. 293 cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid pRL-SV40 (15) encoding the rLuc gene. the expression plasmids encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD had a C-terminal myc tag. the nsp1 proteins had a C-terminal myc tag. cells electroporated with the RNA transcripts were also radiolabeled with Tran35S-label for 1 h at 24 h postelectroporation. lysates were resolved on SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography (right top panel), colloidal Coomassie blue staining (right middle panel), and Western blot analysis with anti-actin antibody (bottom panel). ns, not significant (P > 0.01). 293 cells were electroporated with a reporter mRNA, GLA, carrying the 5\u2032 UTR of rabbit -globin mRNA and the rLuc gene (20) all of the transcripts were capped and polyadenylated. both MERS-CoV nsp1 and MERS-CoV nsp1-CD did not inhibit the luciferase reporter activity. 293 cells were electroporated with a MERS-CoV subgenomic mRNA 8-like RNA transcript. both MERS-CoV nsp1 and MERS-CoV nsp1-CD did not inhibit the reporter gene activity. an increased reporter activity was observed in cells expressing MERS-CoV nsp1. the expression of N protein and the level of N protein was higher in cells expressing MERS-CoV nsp1 than in cells expressing CAT and MERS-CoV nsp1-CD. nsp1 did not inhibit the translation of exogenous reporter mRNAs and MERS-CoV-like mRNAs that were introduced directly into the cytoplasm. 293 cells were electroporated with RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1 or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD. at 18 h postelectroporation, the cells were inoculated with RVFV VLP, carrying LNCR-rLuc mRNA. both CAT, MERS-CoV nsp1 and MERS-CoV nsp1-CD induced the degradation of endogenous nucleus-derived GAPDH mRNA. both nsp1 and nsp1-CD induced the degradation of endogenous nucleus-derived GAPDH mRNA. 293 cells were electroporated with RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD proteins. at 18 h postelectroporation, cells were inoculated with UV-irradiated VLP. the top panel represents the Western blot analysis with anti-myc antibody. receptor, human DPP4 (31), induced a strong inhibition of host protein synthesis. MERS-CoV replication also caused a substantial reduction in the levels of endogenous GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) and -actin mRNAs. this effect was observed both in the absence and in the presence of actinomycin D, an inhibitor of host RNA transcription. RNAs were extracted at 1, 18, 24, or 30 h p.i., and subjected to Northern blot analysis using a GAPDH mRNA-specific probe and -actin mRNA-specific probe. the amounts of 28S and 18S rRNAs in each sample were detected by ethidium bromide staining. 293 cells were transfected with RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD proteins. cells were radiolabeled with Tran35S-label from 8.5 to 9.5 h posttransfection. lysates were resolved on SDS\u201312% PAGE, followed by autoradiography (top panels) and colloidal Coomassie blue staining (middle panels) 293 cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding Ren-EMCV-FF. the plasmid expressing CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD encoded proteins carrying the C-terminal myc tag. at 24 h posttransfection, intracellular RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis. MERS-CoV nsp1 induces an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage at the 5\u2032 region of capped host mRNAs. the endonucleolytically cleaved RNAs are rapidly degraded by the cellular exonuclease, Xrn1 (21). cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding MERS-CoV nsp1 and a plasmid p1 expression resulted in a marked reduction in the amount of the full-length Ren-EMCV-FF RNA. MERS-CoV nsp1 expression also resulted in the generation of a cleaved RNA fragment derived from Ren-EMCV-FF. the amount of the cleaved RNA fragment was lower in MERS-CoV nsp1-expressing cells than in SARS-CoV nsp1-expressing cells the expression of a mutated MERS-CoV nsp1 carrying R146A and K147A mutations (MERS-CoV nsp1-CD; the acronym CD stands for cleavage defective) neither induced the endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in Ren-EMCV-FF RNA nor caused a reduction in the abundance of the full-length Ren-EMCV-FF. MERS-CoV nsp1-CD also inhibited the rLuc reporter activity. however, the extent of inhibition was lower than that induced by MERS-CoV nsp1. these data suggest that MERS-CoV nsp1 exerts an inhibitory effect on host gene expression. subcellular fractionation analyses showed the distribution of MERS-CoV nsp1 and MERS-CoV nsp1-CD in both the cytoplasm and the nuclei of transfected cells expressing nsp1. the purity of the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions was validated by Western blotting of the subcellular fractions. 293 cells were mock transfected (Mock) or transfected with a plasmid encoding the C-terminal myc-tagged MERS-CoV nsp1 or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD. at 18 h posttransfection, cell lysates were fractionated into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions. each fraction was subjected to Western blot analysis with anti-myc (top panels), anti-histone H the subcellular distribution of MERS-CoV nsp1 in both the cytoplasm and nucleus prompted us to investigate whether MERS-CoV nsp1 also targets RNAs transcribed by nuclear RNA polymerase I (Pol I) and Pol III for degradation. plasmids encoding CAT or SARS-CoV nsp1 were used in place of the MERS-CoV expression plasmid. 293 cells were transfected with a plasmid encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1 or MERS-CoV nsp1. nsp1 targets translating mRNAs for mRNA cleavage and translation inhibition by binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. nsp1 targets translating mRNAs for mRNA cleavage. the sedimentation profile of MERS-CoV nsp1 was very different from SARS-CoV nsp1. most of the MERS-CoV nsp1 was detected near the top of the gradient and did not cosediment with the 40S subunit. this suggests that unlike SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1 does not associate tightly with the 40S subunit. encoding CAT, MERS-CoV nsp1, or SARS-CoV nsp1-CD. assayed for luciferase reporter activity at 24 h posttransfection. nsp1 strongly inhibited the reporter gene activity and induced the degradation of rLuc mRNA. 293 cells were coelectroporated with GLA reporter mRNA and RNA transcripts encoding C-terminal myc-tagged CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1 or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD. nsp1 proteins had a C-terminal myc tag; the nsp1 proteins had a C-terminal myc tag. RNA coelectroporation and reporter assay performed as described in panel B. a mERS-CoV subgenomic mRNA 8-like RNA transcript was used in place of the GLA mRNA. a schematic diagram of the MERS-CoV subgenomic mRNA 8-like RNA transcript is shown on top. all of the transcripts were capped and polyadenylated. luciferase reporter assays and Western blot analysis were subjected to luciferase reporter assays. both nsp1 and CAT did not inhibit the reporter activity. 293 cells were electroporated with a MERS-CoV subgenomic mRNA 8-like RNA transcript. mRNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1 or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD did not inhibit the expression of N protein. the level of N protein was higher in cells expressing MERS-CoV nsp1 than in cells expressing CAT ERS-CoV nsp1 does not inhibit translation of virus-like mRNAs synthesized in the cytoplasm. we also extended our findings to evaluate whether MERS-CoV nsp1 also spared mRNAs that are cytoplasmic in origin. 293 cells were electroporated with RNA transcripts encoding CAT, SARS-CoV nsp1, MERS-CoV nsp1 or MERS-CoV nsp1-CD. at 18 h postelectroporation, the cells were inoculated with RVFV VLP. as a negative control, cells were inoculated with UV-irradiated VLPs. both SARS-CoV nsp1 and MERS-CoV nsp1-CD induced degradation of endogenous nucleus-derived GAPDH mRNA. these observations further bolster the idea that MERS-CoV nsp1 specifically targets the nuclear-transcribed host mRNAs for inhibition. cell extracts were prepared at 6 h post-VLP inoculation. the top panel shows the luciferase reporter activities at 6 h post-VLP inoculation. the bottom panel represents the Western blot analysis with anti-myc antibody. MERS-CoV nsp1 and SARS-CoV nsp1 only targeted RNAs that are translationally competent for degradation. unlike SARS-CoV nsp1, which is localized exclusively in the cytoplasm (11, 15), MERS-CoV nsp1 was distributed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm (36) the inability of MERS-CoV nsp1 to inhibit the translation of mRNAs of cytoplasmic origin suggests that MERS-CoV nsp1 does not use the components of the core translational machinery to gain access to translating mRNAs. this suggests that MERS-CoV nsp1 does not utilize the components of the core translational machinery to gain access to translating mRNAs. MERS-CoV nsp1 selectively targets nucleus-derived mRNAs for translation inhibition and mRNA degradation. nsp1 inhibited host protein synthesis and induced degradation of endogenous host mRNAs even in the presence of ActD, which prevents synthesis of new mRNAs. these data have important implications for the regulation of viral gene expression in MERS-CoV-infected cells. we hypothesize that the cytoplasmic origin of viral mRNAs facilitates their escape from MERS-CoV nsp1-induced translation inhibition allowing the efficient production of viral proteins. we speculate that the degradation of endogenous host mRNAs by MERS-CoV nsp1 indirectly facilitates the translation of exogenously delivered mRNAs in the future studies to examine the contribution of host mRNA degradation activity of MERS-CoV nsp1 on viral mRNA translation in MERS-CoV-infected cells are warranted."}
