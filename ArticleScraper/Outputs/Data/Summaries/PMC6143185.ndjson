{"summary": "etiology of ARIs in children admitted to Novosibirsk Children\u2019s Municipal Clinical Hospital in 2013\u20132017. results We detected 1128 (72.3%) samples were positive for at least one virus. most frequently detected pathogens were respiratory syncytial virus (358/1560, 23.0%), influenza virus (344/1560, 22.1%), and rhinovirus (235/1560, 15.1%). human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV), human enterovirus (EV), influenza virus (IFV), human coronavirus (HCoV), adenovirus (HAdV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) are the most common viral agents associated with ARIs, accounting for around 70% of ARIs. etiology of ARIs in children admitted to Novosibirsk Children\u2019s Municipal Clinical Hospital in 2013\u20132017. a total of 1560 samples collected during four epidemic seasons of 2013\u20132017 were enrolled to the study. a total of 1560 samples collected during four epidemic seasons of 2013\u20132017 were enrolled to the study. all specimens tested for 15 common respiratory viruses, including influenza virus types A, B (IFVA and IFVB), human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) types 1\u20134, human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), four human coronaviruses (HCo), human rhinovirus (HRV), human adenovirus (HAdV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) a total of 1560 samples collected during four epidemic seasons of 2013\u20132017 were enrolled to the study. the samples were placed immediately in viral transport medium (Eagle MEM, BSA and antibiotics) and stored at 4\u20138\u00b0C prior transportation to the laboratory. ion of respiratory viruses, including HPIV 1\u20134, HRSV, HMPV, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E, HCoVNL63, HCoV-HKU1, HRV, HAdV, and HBoV was performed using a RT-PCR kit \u00abAmpliSens ARVI-screen-FL\u00bb. positive and negative controls were included in each run. respiratory virus positive rate appeared to decrease with age. lowest positive rate was observed in age group of more than 6 years old. co-infections accounted for 10.4% (163/1560) with lowest rate of incidence in children more than 6 years old compared to children younger than 6 years. in 15.1% (235/1560), followed by HMPV, HPIV and HBoV. the positivity rates of HCoV and HAdV were lower than 5.0%. no difference in etiological distribution of viral pathogens was observed between males and females. multiple infections Co-infections with two or more viruses were detected in 163 out of 1128 (14.5%) positive samples. most co-infected patients were 0\u20136 years of age versus children older than 6 years (3.4%, 10/292) no significant difference was found for incidence of co-infections between the age group less than 1 year (13.2%, 43/325), 1\u20133 years (12.9%, 87/674), and 4\u20136 years (8.9%, 23/259 IFV was one of the most frequently detected viruses among children with ARIs with detection rate 22.1% (344/1560) lowest detection rate of IFV was in less than 1 year old age group (5.8%, 19/325). Totally, 1560 samples collected from patients with ARIs during the period from December 2013 to April 2017 were enrolled in the investigation. there were 824 males (52.8%) and 736 females (47.2%), and the patient\u2019s ages ranged from 3 months to 15 years. the most numerous age group (43.2%) was between 1 and 3 years old. the lowest positive rate was observed in the age group of more than 6 years old (167/302; 55.3%), while the positive rates in age groups less than 6 years old were more than 70%. no statistically significant difference was observed between the age group of more than 6 years old and other age groups. HMPV was detected in age group less than 1 year old much more frequently than in children 1\u20133 years old. incidence of HRSV decreased significantly with increasing age (p 0.05) dropping from 35.1% in children younger than 1 year old to 5.3% in the school-age children (7\u201315 years old group) no significant difference was found for incidence of co-infections between the age group less than 1 year (13.2%, 43/325), 1\u20133 years (12.9%, 87/674) and 4\u20136 years (8.9%, 23/259). the most common combinations were HRSV/HRV, and IFV/HRSV, which amounted to 13.5% of all cases of co-infection respectively. the lowest detection rate of IFV was in the less than 1 year old age group (5.8%, 19/325) the incidence of IFV increased significantly with increasing patients\u2019 age. the lowest influenza activity was investigated in 2013\u20132014 with positivity rate 6.9% of all positive samples. we detected at least one of the tested viruses in 72.3% (1128/1560) of the samples. in similar studies conducted in different regions of the world, the virus detection rate ranged from less than 50% to 75%. the previous study of respiratory infections among children in European part of Russia revealed the 71.5% detection rate of respiratory viruses [32] in the united states, IFV, HRSV and HPIV were the most commonly detected respiratory viruses among children with ARIs in most regions of china. IFV, HRV, HPIV and IFV were the most commonly detected respiratory viruses among children with ARIs in most regions of china. the percentage of influenza A virus accounted for 73.3% and influenza B virus made up 26.7% of all detected influenza viruses. in 2015\u20132016, influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 virus was predominant in Russia, accounting for 79% of all influenza-positive samples."}
