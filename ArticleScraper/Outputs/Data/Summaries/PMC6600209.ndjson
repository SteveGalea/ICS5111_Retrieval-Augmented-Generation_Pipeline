{"summary": "infection with ZIKV is frequently asymptomatic, and clinical manifestations occur in approximately 20% of cases (1). ZIKV infection is also associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a rare immune-mediated paralytic illness (2). four of these antibodies were able to potently neutralize virus with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations at the nanogram-per-milliliter range. this antibody did not elicit Fc-mediated activation of immune effector cells on ZIKV-infected cells as measured by an antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity reporter assay. RESULTS Generation of human ZIKV antibodies from an infected patient. we isolated peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a patient. this patient was likely not preexposed to dengue virus, and these antibodies were likely associated with a primary immune response. antibodies to the nonstructural protein NS1 are also elicited by acute ZIKV infection. we found antibodies neutralized to various degrees, with 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) values ranging from 10 g/ml to approximately 2 ng/ml. NS1-specific antibody AA12 was not able to neutralize infectious virus at the highest concentration tested. chain profilea V gene J gene CDR3 sequence % germ line identity Isotype AC4 IGHV1-2*06 IGHJ6*02 CARDRRSTWYYYYGMDVW 99.1 IgG2 IGLV2-8*01 IGLJ2*01 CSSYAGSNIYVVF 99.7 Lambda AC10 IGHV1-2*06 IGHJ6*02 CARDRRSSWYYYGMDVW 99.1 IgG1 IG CSSYTSSSTRVF 99.7 Lambda AA1 IGHV4-4*02 IGHJ4*02 CARDSQQLVPFDYW 98.2 IgG1 IGLV2-8*01 IGLJ3*02 CSSYAGSNNLRVF 99.4 Lambda FC3 IGHV3-33*03 IGHJ4*02 CVREDYGIFTKFDYW 90.5 IgM IGKV1-5*03 IGKJ1 NS1-specific antibodies did not induce antibody-dependent enhancement of disease when tested on Zika viral particles. we evaluated whether our panel of virion-binding antibodies could induce Fc-mediated immune effector functions on infected cells and if these antibodies could mediate virus internalization into susceptible cells. this surrogate assay examined the ability of antibodies to engage and activate Fc-mediated effector functions. all monoclonal antibodies were tested at a starting concentration of 3.3 g per ml. fold induction was measured as the percentage of infected cells. ADE of disease is commonly thought to be caused by antibodies binding to the surface of virions at nonneutralizing concentrations. we serially passaged MR766 ZIKV with increasing concentrations beginning at 0.5 ng/ml to 500 ng/ml of antibodies AC10, GD12, AC4, AC11, GA3, FC11, and FA12 in duplicates. after 7 to 12 serial passages, we grew viruses from the last passage in 1 to 10 g/ml of antibody and plaque purified six escape variant viruses. the majority of the escape variants to AC10 and AC4 had either a glutamic acid or a glycine at site 162 (domain I) and an arginine or asparagine at site 368 (domain III), suggesting these positions had critical roles in neutralization. however, the wild-type virus passaged in the absence of antibody also had amino acid variability in site 162. six plaque-purified viruses were sequenced in parallel after an identical number of passages in Vero cells. a sequence alignment of 173 publicly available sequences from the Virus Pathogen Resource was performed. 164 of 168 sequences (97.6%) with identifiable amino acids had a serine at position 368 with a polymorphism score of 38. an asparagine occurred twice, arginine occurred once, and a glycine occurred once. a site with no polymorphism has a score of 0, while a maximum score of 439 equates to an equal distribution of 21 alleles. recombinant MR766 ZIKV with an S368R point mutation escapes neutralization by AC10 in vitro. a plaque reduction neutralization test was performed with equivalent amounts of wild-type or S368R MR766 ZIKV. antibodies GA3 and AA1, which induce escape mutations, were tested by the same plaque reduction neutralization test. the assay was performed in duplicate, and error bars represent SEM. we compared the neutralization activities of our antibodies at different stages of viral entry for either the wild-type MR766 or the S368R variant. at time zero (0 h), unattached virus was removed from cell culture by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) infection was measured by 4G2 anti-envelope staining at 48 h postinfection. all antibodies were able to neutralize wild-type virus when added at 3 h. a lower degree of neutralization was observed when antibody was added at 0 h. we adapted a previously established protocol to generate fully human monoclonal antibodies specific to ZIKV (22). first, we single-cell-sorted plasmablasts isolated during acute infection and sequenced the variable regions of the immunoglobulin genes into a human IgG1 expression vector. we cloned the genes into a human IgG1 expression vector and transfected HEK293F cells to generate fully human monoclonal antibodies. antibody AA12 was not able to neutralize infectious virus at the highest concentration tested. ELISAs were performed against MR766 ZIKV supernatant, recombinant MR766 envelope protein, or recombinant MR766 NS1 protein to assess binding activities.

ADE of disease is commonly thought to be caused by antibodies binding to the surface of virions at nonneutralizing concentrations, which enhances viral uptake into Fc receptor-bearing myeloid cells. cytometry plots for antibody AD5 and control IgG are shown as well. we grew viruses from the last passage in 1 to 10 g/ml of antibody and plaque purified six escape variant viruses from each monoclonal antibody (MAb) and another six from the control. compared sequences of the viruses passaged in the presence of antibody (escape variants) to the sequence of the control. variants had mutations at site 161 or 162 (domain I) and FA12 had a combination of mutations in domain II only (site 66, 84, or 251) or an additional mutation in domain I (site 154). escape variants to MAb FC3 had mutations only in domain I at site 165 or 154 (Fig. 3F and 4F), while FC11 escape variants yielded mutations in domains I and/or II in sites 68, 69, mutations were found in the escape variants to AC10 and AC4, our most potent neutralizing MAbs. this amino acid residue is located in the lateral ridge epitope of domain III of the ZIKV E protein and is conserved among almost all circulating ZIKV strains. a sequence alignment and consensus sequence were generated from 173 publicly available sequences from the Virus Pathogen Resource. each amino acid position was then assigned a polymorphism score based on Crooks et al. (46) the polymorphism score represents the normalized entropy of an observed allele distribution. the red line indicates amino acid position 368, where the majority of amino acids are serines. serial passaging of MAb AC10 led to identification of critical residue S368, which lies in the lateral ridge epitope of domain III of the ZIKV envelope protein. site-directed mutagenesis was performed to generate recombinant MR766 ZIKV with the S368R point mutation. rescue titer after 72 h posttransfection demonstrates a reduction in viral titer. titers at 48-h and 72-h time points were not statistically significant. the virus remained intact, ruling out that the virus reverted to express the wild-type envelope protein. however, there may be undetected compensatory mutations in other regions of the genome that could have arisen to increase viral fitness. unattached virus was removed from cell culture by two washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) antibodies were added at a concentration of 10 IC50 at either 3 h, 0 h, or 6 h in order to test inhibition of antibody at the stages of viral attachment, postattachment, or postentry. once the antibody was added, it remained in culture for 24 h. antibodies AC10, AC4, AC3, and GA12 were unable to neutralize the S368R variant at a level comparable to that of the wild-type virus. however, additional work is required to map the epitopes targeted by neutralizing antibodies and to understand whether a potent dominant neutralizing response correlate with a particular germ line rearrangement. all of these potently neutralizing antibodies contained a motif of at least three tyrosine residues in the complementarity-determining region 3 fragment of the heavy chain. AD5 and FC11 were moderately neutralizing, with IC50 values close to 50 ng/ml, and contained the same germ line rearrangements. the authors were able to map binding sites of these antibodies to the lateral ridge epitope of domain III of the envelope protein. they found a similarly high potency of neutralization in the nanogram-per-milliliter range. we wanted to explore the role of Fc-mediated functions exhibited by these neutralizing antibodies. ADE occurs when antibody binds virion and facilitates internalization into innate immune cells that allow for viral replication. many neutralizing antibodies had the ability to induce ADE at low concentrations. antibodies FA12 and EA7 were both poor neutralizers of ZIKV. 164 of 168 sequences (97.6%) with identifiable amino acids had a serine at site 368. however, one strain contained an S368R mutation, suggesting that this variant, although very uncommon, does occur in nature. we identified escape variants with multiple mutations. neutralization of this mutant MR766 was rescued in parallel. the goal of this experiment was to determine whether our antibodies could inhibit Zika virus replication after virion was bound to the cell surface. neutralization efficiency was substantially lower when antibody was added after viral entry. human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells (Gibco) were grown in Expi293 expression medium. MR766 virus (Rhesus/1947/Uganda BEI NR-50065) was obtained from the ATCC. plasmablasts defined as CD19+ CD3 CD20 CD38high CD27high were isolated. monoclonal antibodies were generated in accordance with the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Institutional Review Board. 30 ml of Expi293 cells at 1 106 cells/ml was transfected with 30 g of pFUESs-CHIg-hIgG1, pFUESs-CLIg-hK, and 81 l of ExpiFectamine reagent. after 120 h, supernatants were cleared by low-speed centrifugation and purified with protein G resin. plasmids and 81 l of ExpiFectamine transfection reagent were pelleted by low-speed centrifugation. supernatant was removed and incubated with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) resin. the retained resin was washed four times with 15 ml of washing buffer. plates were washed three times with PBS between each step. antibodies were incubated at a starting concentration of 10 g/ml and incubated for 2 h. a modified plaque reduction neutralization test was performed. cells were seeded into 96-well flat white-bottom plates and infected after 24 h with Zika virus MR766 at an MOI of 0.01. antibodies were added in a volume of 25 l at a starting concentration of 10 g/ml. cells were then incubated for another 6 h at 37\u00b0C. fold induction was calculated as follows: (RLUinduced \u2013 RLUbackground)/(RLUuninduced \u2013 RLUbackground) the mean values and standard errors of the means were reported. a nonlinear regression curve was generated using GraphPad Prism. escaped or wild-type virus was serially passaged on a vero cell monolayer in the presence of increasing amounts of antibody. in parallel, wild-type virus was passaged on the same days to account for adaptive mutations that may arise during passaging. each sample was double barcoded using random hexamers. sequence-independent single primer amplification (42). samples were sequenced using 300-bp paired-end reads on an Illumina MiSeq instrument. sequence variation analysis was performed using Virus Pathogen Resource (44, 45) the glycan from MR766 was deleted from the plasmid by removal of the nucleotide sequence GTCAATGATACA, corresponding to amino acids VNDT, by site-directed mutagenesis. the PCR products were cloned into the pCDNA6.2 plasmid by using an In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (TaKaRa Bio) at 0 h, the cultures were washed twice with cold PBS. fresh DMEM with 2% FBS was added at either 3 h, 0 h, or +6 h. antibodies were added at either 3 h, 0 h, or +6 h. human embryonic kidney Expi293F cells (Gibco) were grown in Expi293 expression medium. MR766 virus (Rhesus/1947/Uganda BEI NR-50065) was obtained from BEI Resources. ficoll density (GE Healthcare) centrifugation was performed on whole-blood samples to isolate the buffy coat. peripheral blood mononuclear cells were single-cell sorted onto freshly prepared catch buffer (50 l of 1 M Tris, pH 8, and 125 l of RNasin in 5 ml of RNase-free water) supernatants were cleared by low-speed centrifugation and purified with protein G resin. a mammalian expression plasmid expressing the NS1 of ZIKV MR766 was generated by incorporating the last 24 amino acids of ZIKV envelope (NGSISLMCLALGGVLIFLSTAVSA) into the amino terminus of the NS1 coding region. the resin-supernatant mixture was passed over 10-ml polypropylene columns (Qiagen) the retained resin was washed four times with 15 ml of washing buffer (50 mM Na2HCO3, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 8) buffer was exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) of pH 7.4. GraphPad Prism, version 6, was used to calculate values of the area under the concentration-time curve. a modified plaque reduction neutralization test was performed as described previously. IC50 was calculated from the curve. antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. Enhancement of ZIKV infection. dilutions of purified monoclonal antibody were incubated with ZIKV (MR766) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, and antibiotics (100 units/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin [Pen-Strep]; Gibco) as a negative control, purified human polyclonal antibody that was not reactive to the antibody and virus mixtures were added to six-well plates of vero cells. after 1 h, the medium was replaced with minimum essential medium with the antibody alone. cells were observed daily for signs of cytopathic effect (CPE) a polymorphism score is assigned for each amino acid position using a modified formula from Crooks et al. (46): score = 100 sum(Pi log Pi) the polymorphism score represents the normalized entropy of an observed allele distribution. 293T cells were seeded at a density of 1 106 cells per ml in six-well polylysine-coated plates. cells were transfected with 5 g of DNA per well with 100 l of Opti-MEM. at 72 h posttransfection virus was harvested and plaque purified. ies added at 3 h were replenished with fresh DMEM with 2% FBS. at 2 days postinfection cells were collected, fixed, and stained with 4G2 pan-flavivirus anti-envelope antibody in Perm/Wash buffer. cells were then incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488."}
