{"summary": "EBV is a major etiologic agent for malignant diseases of epithelial and lymphoid cell origin 1-3. the mode and influence of EBV integration is still not clear due to the lack of an impartial method to detect and survey genome-wide EBV integration sites. genome sequencing and analysis The libraries of C666-1 and Raji DNA were prepared following the Illumina Truseq DNA sample preparation protocol. each library was subjected to sequence with 90-base paired-end using an Illumina HiSeq instrument. average fragment size used for sequencing was about 480 bp. split reads are used to identify EBV integration positions. extract split reads from original alignment result and assemble the split reads into contigs. match rate cutoff is set to 0.95. ide variations (SNVs) were detected by the SAMtools 30 software. the minimal depth cover the variation site is not less than 4; the minimum variation quality score is not less than 20; the distance between two nearby variations is not less than 5. genomic DNA of C666-1 and Raji cells was extracted and purified using Qiagen Gentra Puregene reagents. each library was subjected to 2 lanes, resulting in at least 60-fold haploid coverage for each sample. reads cover fuse boundaries of the human genome and the EBV genome are called split reads. split reads are used to identify EBV integration positions. extract split reads from original alignment result and assemble the split reads into contigs. match rate cutoff set to 0.95. split reads cover the same fuse boundary will be assembled into the same contig. single nucleotide variations (SNVs) were detected by the SAMtools 30 software. results Detection of EBV integration In this study, we processed whole-genome deep sequencing (> 60 coverage) on C666-1 and Raji cells. total raw data of viral sequence in C666-1 is 117,172,040 bp and 114,444,102 bp in Raji. total raw data of C666-1 is 182,230,285,487bp, and Raji is 183,866,611,697 bp. average coverage depth of human genome in C666-1 and Raji are 62.90 and 63.46, respectively. raw reads 2,328,493,430 2,298,076,610 Raw bases (bp) 209,564,408,700 206,826,894,900 Clean reads 2,200,200,436 2,175,753,790 Clean bases (bp) 198,018,039,240 195,817,841,100 Rate of clean reads. the integration of virus DNA into the host chromosome could cause chromosome instability has been reported 46. the integration of virus DNA into the host chromosome could cause chromosome instability has been reported 46. in Raji, most breakpoints located inside or nearby genome structural variation regions were probably induced by EBV integration. in EBV genome, we also surveyed the integration sites, which were proved to be randomly distributed in viral genome. six EBV subtypes were 99.17% (GD1), 99.33% (EBV-WT), 99.33% (B95-8), 99.00% (GD2), 98.77% (HKNPC1), and 98.51% (AG876) the result showed that Raji EBV genome was more similar to the subtypes derived from the lymphocyte (EBV-WT, B95-8). a total of 891 SNVs (238 were nonsynonymous) were detected in the C666-1 EBV genome. 654 SNVs (224 were nonsynonymous) in Raji viral strain. phylogenetic trees based on protein sequence alignment of EBNA1 (B), LMP1 (C) and BZLF1 (D) were generated. the total raw data of viral sequence in C666-1 is 117,172,040 bp and 114,444,102 bp in Raji. the total raw data of C666-1 is 182,230,285,487bp, and Raji is 183,866,611,697 bp. average coverage depth of human genome in C666-1 and Raji are 62.90 and 63.46 respectively.
