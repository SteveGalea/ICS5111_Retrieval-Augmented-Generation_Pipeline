{"summary": "PNAG was detected by confocal microscopy on the surface of microbial cells. the control was a human IgG1 mAb, F429, directly conjugated to AF488, green fluorescence. the specificity of the mAb is shown by binding to wild-type Staphylococcus aureus but not to this organism when the ica biosynthetic genes for PNAG are deleted. the last three organisms are closely related to E. coli but lack a readily identifiable four-gene pga locus. mAb F598 also bound to yeast and hyphal forms of Candida albicans, as well as to the fungal organisms Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium solani, and Cryptococcus neoformans. s from cultures of the indicated microbes were fixed with paraformaldehyde, placed onto slides, exposed to cold methanol, and then reacted with either control mAb F429 conjugated to AF488 or mAb F598 to PNAG also conjugated to AF488 (green fluorescence) the label \u201cdual\u201d indicates overlay of red and green channels. conjugate vaccines contain 7, 10, or 13 conjugated capsular polysaccharides (34) the use of these vaccines has raised concerns that selection for nonvaccine serotypes will result in them becoming more common causes of infection. a PNAG-targeted vaccine may effectively prevent infection by a large number of pneumococcal strains. the PNAG molecules were spatially located in the same area as classic capsular antigens. we costained serogroup A N. meningitidis with mAb F598 to PNAG and a mouse IgG mAb to the serogroup A antigen. the different-sized gold particles were mixed together on the bacterial surface. anti-serogroup A panels show binding only of the antibody to serogroup A. panels labeled anti-PNAG (598) + anti-serogroup A show binding of both antibodies. PNAG must be expressed on the microbial surface in vivo. nasopharyngeal fluid from chinchillas experimentally infected with S. pneumoniae serogroup 19A. colocalization of the chitinase-resistant, dispersin B-sensitive PNAG antigen was readily seen. nasopharyngeal fluid from chinchillas experimentally infected with C. rodentium. two sections stained for both PNAG and DNA shown. sections stained with either control mAb F429-AF488 or mAb F598-AF488 to PNAG (green) plus SYTO 83 (red) to visualize DNA. sections of a human lung infected with M. tuberculosis (K\u2013N) were stained with SYTO 62. polyclonal antibody and mAb F598 mediated opsonic killing of four strains of S. pneumoniae. mAb F598 mediated killing of three distinct strains of E. faecalis. mutant of strain 771 lacking ability to produce hyaluronic acid group A streptococci (GAS) capsule. killing of six strains of N. gonorrhoeae (F) and five strains of serogroup B (G) calculated to subtract out any reduction in cfu counts by a comparable dilution of normal rabbit serum. bars represent means of triplicates to quadruplicates determined in the same assay. antibodies to PNAG are only protective against microbial cells that produce this antigen. antibodies to PNAG are only protective against microbial cells that produce this antigen and not isogenic mutants in which ica or pga genes have been deleted. antibody to PNAG significantly reduced mortality associated with pneumonia and systemic spread. mAb F598 was given 4 h before intranasal infection with serotype 9V strain in FVB mice. levels of N. meningitidis serogroup B strain B16B6 in the brains of 3-d-old neonatal mice given 50 L of indicated antiserum 24 h before i.p. infection with two different doses of bacteria. brain levels determined 24 h postinfection. mAb F598 is a positive effect in a setting of infectious colitis caused by the indigenous microbial constituents of the murine gastrointestinal tract. we used the murine BALB/c T-bet/ RAG2/ (TRUC) model of spontaneous colitis (40, 41). females at 4 wk of age with biweekly injections of mAb F598 or control human IgG1 mAb F105 determined the level of colonic pathology at 8 wk of age. mAb treatment cleared detectable infection from the eyes of seven of eight mice challenged with the dose of 1 105 yeast cells per eye. cfu counts recovered from the cornea of mice infected with C. albicans during keratitis. Mice treated with either control IgG1 mAb or F598 24 h before eye infection followed by topical application of 5 g mAb per eye 24 and 32 h postinfection. berghei ANKA infection given i.p. injections of either 0.2 mL of normal goat serum or 0.2 mL of goat antibody raised to 9GlcNH2-TT on days 1, +2, +5, and +8. antibody to PNAG significantly extended the survival of the treated mice. only one died of cerebral malaria by day 7, four developed increasing levels of parasitemia. PNAG-negative variants in a microbial population can have an advantage in regard to uptake of exogenous DNA. we took advantage of the lack of PNAG in the GFP derivative strain to test the efficacy of antibody against the PNAG-negative P. berghei variant. PNAG Enhances Microbial resistance to environmental stress. PNAG was detected by confocal microscopy on the surface of microbial cells using the antigen-specific human IgG1 mAb F598. the control was a human IgG1 mAb, F429, directly conjugated to AF488, green fluorescence. the specificity of the mAb is shown by binding to wild-type Staphylococcus aureus but not to this organism when the ica biosynthetic genes for the last three organisms are closely related to E. coli but lack a readily identifiable four-gene pga locus. mAb F598 also bound to yeast and hyphal forms of Candida albicans, as well as to the fungal organisms Aspergillus flavus, Fusarium solani, and Cryptococcus neoformans. mAb F598 was binding to PNAG or a closely related surface oligosaccharide that would need to be at least seven N-acetylglucosamine monomers in length. all of the organisms tested met these immunochemical criteria (see Fig. S1E for P. falciparum sporozoites and Fig. S2 for other organisms). conjugate vaccines contain from seven to 23 different conjugated or purified polysaccharides (34), but the use of these vaccines has raised concerns that selection for nonvaccine serotypes will result in them becoming more common causes of infection. a PNAG-targeted vaccine may effectively prevent infection by a large number of pneumococcal strains. meningitidis serogroup B is a major pathogen for which a capsule-specific vaccine is not possible due to the self-antigenic, nonimmunogenic properties of the serogroup B antigen. we costained serogroup A N. meningitidis with mAb F598 to PNAG and a mouse IgG mAb to the serogroup A antigen. anti-serogroup A panels show binding only of the antibody to serogroup A. panels labeled anti-PNAG (598) + anti-serogroup A show binding of both antibodies. PNAG must be expressed on the microbial surface in vivo. nasopharyngeal fluid from chinchillas experimentally infected with S. pneumoniae serogroup 19A. PNAG was detected around microbes associated with epithelial cells. in ocular tissues from mice with C. albicans keratitis, PNAG was detected on the DNA-positive portion of the fungal cells. mAb F598-AF488 to PNAG (green) plus SYTO 83 (red) to visualize DNA. sections stained with either control mAb F429-AF488 or control mAb F598-AF488 to PNAG (green) plus SYTO 83 (red) to visualize DNA. polyclonal antibody and mAb F598 mediated opsonic killing of four strains of S. pneumoniae. mutant of strain 771 lacking ability to produce hyaluronic acid group A streptococci (GAS) capsule. mAb F598 mediated opsonic killing of two strains of S. pyogenes. bacterial killing of six strains of N. gonorrhoeae (F) and five strains of serogroup B (G) mediated by polyclonal rabbit antibody to PNAG. kill calculated to subtract out any reduction in cfu counts by a comparable dilution of normal rabbit serum (NRS) antibodies to PNAG are only protective against microbial cells that produce this antigen. previous results have shown that antibodies to PNAG are only protective against microbial cells that produce this antigen and not isogenic mutants. antibody to PNAG significantly reduced mortality associated with pneumonia and systemic spread. mAb F598 was given 4 h before intranasal infection with serotype 9V strain in FVB mice. levels of N. meningitidis serogroup B strain B16B6 in the brains of 3-d-old neonatal mice 24 h after i.p. infection with two different doses of bacteria. brain levels determined 24 h postinfection. mAb F598 was injected with human IgG1 mAb F105 specific to HIV gp120. mAb F598-treated mice had an injury score of zero, whereas six of eight control mice had injury scores of 1\u20133 (P = 0.029, one-tailed Fisher\u2019s exact test) TRUC females at 4 wk of age with biweekly injections of mAb F598 or control human IgG1 mAb F105 significantly reduced the total pathology score in the recipient mice compared with controls. mAb treatment cleared detectable infection from the eyes of seven of eight mice challenged with the dose of 1 105 yeast cells per eye. cfu counts recovered from cornea of mice infected with C. albicans during keratitis. mice treated with 200 g i.p. of either control IgG1 mAb or F598 24 h before eye infection followed by topical application of 5 g mAb per eye 24 and 32 h postinfection. i.p. injections of 0.2 mL of normal goat serum or 0.2 mL of goat antibody raised to 9GlcNH2-TT on days 1, +2, +5, and +8. antibody to PNAG significantly extended the survival of the treated mice. five of eight mice treated with normal serum died by day 9. surface polysaccharides can interfere with DNA uptake. all of the mice in both arms of this experiment died by day 10. PNAG Enhances Microbial resistance to environmental stress. the common expression of PNAG on the surface of diverse bacterial, fungal, and protozoal cells provides the potential to elicit immunity via a broadly protective vaccine and/or passive antibody therapy. we detected in vivo expression of PNAG on microbes infecting human and animal tissues, consistent with prior findings that in vivo infection increases expression of PNAG (9). the specificity of these antibodies has previously been demonstrated among bacterial isolates with known ica or pga operon the loss of immunoreactivity following treatment with dispersin B and periodate provides compelling evidence for the presence of an oligosaccharide or polymer of -(16)\u2013linked N-acetylglucosamine on the surface of the microbes we studied. the key property of antibodies that bind to PNAG needed for broad protection is either facilitation of fragment crystallizable-mediated immune clearance or, as found for all of the microbes studied to date, deposition of ops mAb F598 has been successfully tested in a phase I clinical trial for safety and pharmacokinetics (53) no adverse events were reported following injection of up to 17 mg/kg of mAb F598 into humans (53). mAb F598 has been successfully tested in a phase I clinical trial for safety and pharmacokinetics (53). preclinical animal and human tests conducted to date indicate administering or inducing a complement-fixing antibody to PNAG does not lead to clinically significant minor or major adverse events. the strains of microbes, their source, suppliers, and method of growth used in this study are listed in Table S1. antibody to serogroup A N. meningitidis was provided by Peter Rice. glucan from yeast was obtained from Calbiochem. slides were reacted with control or PNAG-specific mAbs directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 at 5.2 g/mL. sporozoites were dissected by cutting the thorax at the scutum. the sporozoites were isolated from the separated heads and the anterior portions of the scutum using Ozaki tubes. slides were dried overnight and wrapped in aluminum foil. in vitro killing of S. pneumoniae, E. faecalis, S. pyogenes, and C. albicans followed published protocols used with S. aureus (17), except that the differentiated HL60 promyelocytic cell line (ATCC) was used as a source of phagocytes. two-day-old neonatal mice were injected i.p. with 50 L of either normal or immune serum to 9GlcNH2-TT and 24 h later infected by the i.p. route. survival over 24 h was monitored. 98 or 0.9% NaCl (control group) infected intranasally with 1 108 cfu per mouse. mice were euthanized by cervical dislocation and lungs were collected. we adapted the mouse model of ulcerative keratitis (56) to evaluate protective efficacy of mAb F598 against fungal infection and associated corneal pathology. one group of mice was injected 24 h before infection with 200 g of control mAb F429 or mAb F598 to PNAG followed by topical treatment with 5 g in 5 L at 24 h and 32 h postinfection. female C57BL/6 mice, 8\u201314 wk old, were inoculated i.p. with 1 105 infected RBCs. CM was diagnosed by clinical signs, including ruffled fur; unbalanced, deviation of the head; ataxia; paralysis; convulsions; and coma. human IgG1 mAbs with V-regions encoding specificity for P. aeruginosa alginate, mAb F429 (32) or PNAG (21) cloned into TCAE 6.1 vector. antibodies raised to either dPNAG or synthetic 9GlcNH2 conjugated to tetanus toxoid were prepared and used as described. slides were reacted with control or PNAG-specific mAbs directly conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 at 5.2 g/mL. after 2 h at room temperature (RT) or overnight at 4 \u00b0C, slides were washed and observed by confocal microscopy. control and immune sera were diluted at 1:50 in PBS + 1% BSA. slides were washed three times for 2 min in PBS, then 15 L of each serum sample added to individual wells. slides were washed three times for 2 min in PBS and then blocked with 16 L of PBS + 1% BSA. two groups of 6-wk-old CD1(ICR) female mice were immunized i.p. with 200 L per mouse of rabbit antibody to 9GlcNH2-TT or normal rabbit sera 24 h and 4 h before infection. spleens were recovered from the mice, homogenized, and diluted. inocula of serotype 2 strain D39 were applied to napes of anesthetized CBA/N mice 24 h after i.p. injection of 200 L of normal serum or immune serum to PNAG. survival over the next week was monitored. moribund animals were humanely killed and counted as deaths. Pups were injected i.p. starting at 4 wk of age with 15 mg/kg of mAb F105 or mAb F598. at 8 wk of age, colons from all experimental mice were harvested upon sacrifice. colonic contents removed before fixation in 4% paraformaldehyde. mice were evaluated for corneal pathology on a scale of 1\u20134 as described (56), killed at 32 or 48 h postinfection, and then eyes processed for enumeration of fungal cells in the cornea. a second group received topical treatment with 5 g in 5 L at 24 h and 24 h postinfection. mice that did not develop CM were monitored until parasitemia exceeded 50%. all experiments carried out at Harvard Medical School/Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital were conducted under an approved protocol. moribund animals were humanely killed and counted as deaths. survival over 24 h was monitored. mice were humanely killed and counted as deaths. TRUC mice were injected i.p. starting on day 7 of life then every 3 d with either control human IgG1 mAb F105 or anti-PNAG mAb F598. at 8 wk of age, colons from all experimental mice were harvested upon sacrifice. yeast cells were recovered, washed, and resuspended to contain between 105 and 5 107 cfu in 5 L. one group of mice was injected i.p. 24 h before infection with 200 g of control mAb F429 or mAb F598 to PNAG. another group received topical treatment at 4, 8, and 24 h postinfection. fected mice succumb to cerebral malaria (CM) between days 7 and 9 postinfection. CM was diagnosed by clinical signs, including ruffled fur, unbalanced, deviation of the head, ataxia, paralysis, convulsions, and coma, followed by death (2)."}
