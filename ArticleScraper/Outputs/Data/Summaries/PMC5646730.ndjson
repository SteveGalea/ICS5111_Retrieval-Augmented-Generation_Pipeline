{"summary": "Vaccination is a process of introducing antigenic material to activate an individual's immune system to develop adaptive immunity to a pathogen. it has proven to be the most successful and cost-effective prophylactic measure against infectious diseases. despite the many examples of successful vaccines, many disease threats lack an effective prophylactic measure. synthetic nanoparticles have been widely adopted for vaccine development 3. these particles, typically 25 to 200 nm in diameter, have shown effective immune potentiation in vivo. nanoparticles promise better safety profiles because of their non-replicating nature. nanoparticles for vaccination Towards mimicking viral features, preparing nanoparticulates in the range of 20 to 200 nm in size is the first step prior to subsequent vaccine development. nanoparticulates can be modified to provide a functionalized and stable interface for different biomedical applications. liposomes have been incorporated with a plethora of adjuvants ranging from small molecules 26, 27, glycolipids 28-31, oligodeoxynucleotides 32-35, to cyclic dinucleotides 6, 36. liposomes are structurally analogous to enveloped viruses, which are formed from budding of infected cells. liposomes consist of liposome-like lipid vesicles and viral envelope glycoproteins. the fusion vesicles retain some viral characteristics. the virosomes have been applied for both drug delivery and vaccination purposes 37, 38. lipoplexes contain cationic lipid derivatives for the complexation with nucleic acids 10, 51, 52. lipoplexes activate innate immune receptors, leading to an upregulation of type I interferons. these mRNAs are translated into antigens of interest, thereby promoting an antigen-specific immune response. PLGA-based nanoparticles are known to be biodegradable, non-toxic and non-immunogenic. Upon administration, the polymer is degraded into lactic acids and glycolic acids in vivo to be safely metabolised in the body. PLGA nanoparticles provide a robust platform for antigen functionalization. chitosan-based nanoformulations have been widely adopted for vaccine development. examples include vaccines against Clostridium botulinum type-A neurotoxin 56, Neospora caninum 88, HBV 77, and Newcastle disease 81. gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been studied extensively for biomedical applications. the type of polymer used in the nano-formulation strongly affects the structure, properties and applications of the particles. auNPs can be synthesized reproducibly with a high level of precision. morphological tunability adds dimension of virus mimicry with introduction of non-spherical particles. gold nanorods have been used as a vaccine vector for the delivery respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) F protein 106. these non-spherical particles bear resemblance to rod-like viruses. pore size and surface functionalization of MSNs can be modified to control the encapsulation and release of antigens or adjuvants of choice 114-117. carbon-based nanoparticles, such as carbon nanotubes and graphene, have also been studied as vaccine carriers 122, 123. nanoparticle platforms with imaging functionality, including polymeric upconversion nanoparticles 128, and iron oxide nanoparticles 129, have also been studied as antigen carriers for vaccine applications. liposomes and lipid-based nanoparticles are self-assembled, spherical vesicles consisting of a phospholipid bilayer and an aqueous inner core 14, 15. liposomes have been incorporated with a plethora of adjuvants ranging from small molecules 26, 27, glycolipids 28-31, oligodeoxynucleotides 32-35, to cyclic dinucleotides 6, 36. liposomes have been incorporated with a plethora of adjuvants ranging from small molecules 26, 27, glycolipids 28-31, oligodeoxynucleotides 32-35, to immunoization with virosomes was reported to reactivate influenza-specific memory CD4+ T cells that supported proliferation of antigen-specific effector cells 46. induction of cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses has been demonstrated with a Sendai virus-based carrier system loaded with ovalbumin (OVA) polymeric nanoparticles are typically solid particles between 10 nm to 200 nm. they have been an attractive platform for vaccine delivery as antigens and adjuvants can be either surface attached to or interior loaded inside these nanoparticles 55-59.

AuNPs vaccines have been explored in clinical trials for hepatitis B and malaria vaccinations 96, 97. they also allow anchoring of nucleic acids for DNA vaccine applications 98. many alternative surface functionalization strategies have been explored. the nanospheres and the nanocubes induced tumor necrosis factor-, IL-6, IL-12, and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. the nanorods induced interleukin-1 and interleukin-18 via an inflammasome-dependent mechanism 104. this shape-dependent immunological property may be due to the differing surface energies associated with different nanoscale features. antigen conjugated SWCTs showed good uptake by dendritic cells in vitro. subcutaneous immunization with these SWCTs promoted induction of antigen-specific IgG. graphene nanosheets were used to deliver antigens to facilitate antigen cross-presentation to CD8+ T cells 123. lymphatic system is a subset of the circulatory system that consists of a complex network of vessels, tissues and organs. as blood exits the blood vasculature to become interstitial fluid, the lymphatic system provides a return route for this interstitial fluid to the blood vessels. nanoparticle vaccines can effectively target immune cells in lymph nodes, delivering antigens or adjuvants following administration in peripheral tissues. nanoparticle vaccines are most commonly administered subcutaneously as opposed to the conventional intramuscular route for subunit vaccines. nanoparticles can exploit both cell-mediated and convective transport for lymph node localization. nanoparticles can exploit both cell-mediated and convective transport for lymph node localization. Enhanced antigen delivery by nanoparticles facilitates antigen presentation and T cell activation. phosphotidylserine, a lipid more susceptible to macrophage recognition and capture, increased lymph node accumulation by 3-fold. other lipid modification strategies, such as steric stabilization and ligand functionalization, have also been reported to influence the lymph node accumulation of liposomes. 25 nm particles were efficiently drained to lymphatic vessels. interstitial transport of 100 nm particles was less efficient. such enhanced lymph node delivery could be attributed to increased colloidal stability of polymeric nanoparticles. nanoparticle vaccines can promote preferential accumulation of antigens in the draining lymph nodes and enhance expansion of antigen-specific T cells. liposomes of comparable sizes were much less effective in shutting antigens to draining lymph nodes. nanoparticles have been extensively applied to localize immunological adjuvants to lymph nodes for improved safety and potency. these molecular danger signals are often similar to viral pathogens regarding their immune potentiating mechanisms, triggering innate immunity and in turn facilitating adaptive immune responses. a large number of immune cells, including B cells, DCs, and macrophages were shown to readily take up these adjuvant-loaded nanogels 158. synthetic vaccine particles encapsulating resiquimod (R848, a TLR7/8 and TLR9 ligand) augmented humoral and cellular immune responses to both soluble and nanoparticle-delivered proteins compared to that observed with free R848. antigen and adjuvant are localized on the same nanoparticles for synchronized delivery. the nanodisc significantly improved the co-delivery of antigens and adjuvants to lymph nodes compared to soluble vaccine. cd-GMP is a potent agonist of the STING pathway. it is expected that the liposome-bound peptide antigen was delivered in a similar fashion. it is expected that the liposome-bound peptide antigen was delivered in a similar fashion. 70 nm, 170 nm and 400 nm liposomes had approximately 76%, 61%, 30%, and 18% of the injected dose entering the lymphatic system. incorporating phosphotidylserine, a lipid more susceptible to macrophage recognition and capture, increased the lymph node accumulation by 3-fold. polypropylene sulfide nanoparticles of well-defined sizes were

adjuvant-loaded nanogels 158. viral particles shuttle antigen targets and adjuvanting nucleic acids simultaneously. such antigen/adjuvant coordination, or its absence, has been shown to strongly influence immune cell activation 162. the immune system can respond to viruses through multiple PAMPs including glycoprotein, DNA, dsRNA, and ssRNA. a number of studies demonstrated that delivering antigen and adjuvant in separate but similar nanocarriers can also elevate antigen-specific immune responses. in one example, an HIV antigen was anchored on the surface of liposomes and co-delivered with a liposomal formulation of cd-GMP, a potent agonist of the STING pathway. non-repetitive antigens are usually less effective in inducing immune responses 170-173. multivalent interactions promote

biomolecules vary from DNA 217, 219, 220, adjuvant 221, small peptides, and protein antigens 155, 218, 222, 223. it is important to note that formation of protein corona is a dynamic process that can be strongly influenced by both nanomaterials and antigen of interest 224. adsorption 225 could have both positive and negative effects on the resulting vaccine formulations. membrane cloaking approach enables coupling of membrane-anchored antigens in their native conformation with immunogenic nanocarriers. nanoparticle vaccines Association of protein antigens with nanoparticles can be divided into particle encapsulation and surface association. the strong interaction between sulfur and gold drives the sulfur atom to fill the free orbitals of a gold atom. such approach has been extensively
