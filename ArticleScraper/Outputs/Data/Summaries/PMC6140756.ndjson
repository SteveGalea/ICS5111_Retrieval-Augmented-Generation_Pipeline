{"summary": "50 nasopharyngeal specimens were collected from 18 patients with asthma. samples were tested for 19 viruses and 7 bacteria using multiplex real-time PCR. most patients had multiple isolates, which changed during the study period. many children with asthma develop respiratory symptoms, especially during winter. many of their clinical findings, however, result from respiratory infections that require supportive care and minimize exposure to respiratory pathogens. prospective case\u2013control pilot study aimed to estimate prevalence of nasopharyngeal isolates in children with asthma during winter season. it aimed to address the importance of controlling respiratory pathogens in the treatment of childhood asthma. children 3\u20136 years of age, with a diagnosis of asthma, were eligible to participate in the study. a score of zero indicated well-controlled asthma, 1\u20132 partly-controlled asthma, and 3\u20134 uncontrolled asthma. forced oscillation technique (FOT) was used to assess airway resistance using a commercial device. the viruses were influenza (Flu A, B, A-H1, A-H1pdm09, and A-H3), PIV (1\u20134), RSV (A and B), AdV, hEV, human metapneumovirus (MPV), human bocavirus (hBoV), hRV, and CoV NL63, CoV 229E, and CoV OC43. the bacteria were Streptococcus pneumoniae (SP), SP 11 2 0.24 None 10 (M, 6.4 years) hRV 0 4 \u20130.06 ICS started 11 (F, 4.9 years) SP, HI, hRV 7 4 1.54 Montelukast added to ICS 13 (M, 4.2 years) SP, HI, hRV 16 3 0.20 Salmeterol added to ICS 14 (M, 4.2 years) SP, HI, hEV, PIV3 4 1 3.05 None nasopharyngeal isolates, and escalation of asthma prophylaxis CCQ score GINA score N* R5 z-score Isolates Treatment escalated N (%) P 0 0\u20131 5 \u20130.48 (1.22) SP, HI, hRV, CoV 229E 0 (0) 0.4 2 4 3.50 (0.54) SP, HI, hRV, hEV, AdV, PIV1 2 za virus 1; PIV3, parainfluenza virus 3; R5, airway resistance at 5 Hz Table 3. a child 1 was found to have symptoms of allergic rhinitis and mild night cough. the unpaired t-test was used to compare the R5 z-score between the children with asthma and the controls. for all tests, statistical significance was defined by a 2-sided P-value 0.05. each participant had only 1 sample collected between January and March 2017. patients, ID number (sex, age, age) Isolates CCQ score GINA score R5 z-score Treatment modification 1 (M, 6.2 years) HI, hRV 0 3 0.59 None 2 (F, 4.8 years) SP 2 1 1.48 None 3 (M, 3.7 years) hRV 2 4 Not done Increased dose of ICS 4 (M, 4.8 years) SP, HI, BPP, hRV 10 4 \u20130.1 CCQ score, GINA assessment of asthma control score, R5 z-score, nasopharyngeal isolates, and escalation of asthma prophylaxis.

CCQ scores ranged from 1 to 7 of a maximum score of 27. 4 (24%) had moderate symptoms. 4 (24%) had no symptoms (CCQ score =0), Table 1. patients with a CCQ score of 1\u20137 had significantly higher R5 z-score (P=0.025) but only 2 of these patients had treatment escalation. the impact of common cold symptoms on airway resistance is shown in Figure 2A. the results of their airway resistance and CCQ scores are detailed in Table 3. the nasopharynx is a reservoir for pathogens associated with asthma. the majority of patients with asthma had several viral pathogens. pertussis increased symptoms, possibly falsely attributed to worsening asthma control, leading to inappropriate escalation of their medications before the infection was diagnosed. this was highlighted during the 2004 pertussis outbreak in MN, USA where the population attributable risk percentage of asthma for risk of pertussis was calculated to be 17%. studies are needed to address important variables relevant to this organism, such as serotypes (especially HRV-16), upper vs lower respiratory colonization, and host susceptibility (eg, variability in expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1).2 Airway inflammation has been reported in infections with Flu viruses. specific measures have been suggested to minimize recurrent infections in children with asthma include hand hygiene, a healthy balanced diet, active probiotic supplements, and the immunostimulant OM-85.22 Further studies are needed to investigate whether reducing exposure to pathogens would improve asthma control. patients 2 and 3 had treatment modifications, which included increased inhaled corticosteroid dosing. patients 2 and 3 had treatment modifications, including increased corticosteroid dosing. adenovirus; BP, Bordetella pertussis; BPP, Bordetella parapertussis; CCQ, common cold questionnaire; coV 229E; coronavirus NL63; coV OC43; F, female; GINA, global initiative of asthma; hEV, human enterovirus; HI, Haemophilus influenzae; hRV, human rhinovirus; M, male; SP, Streptoc SP, HI 13 4 1.68 15 (F, 4.9 years) HI, hRV 3 0 0.67 16 (M, 3.6 years) None detected Not done Not done 17 (M, 6.1 years) HI 8 0 0.35 18 (M, 3.2 years) Not done Not done Not done Note: Patient 2 had increased inhaled corticosteroid dosing. 4 >12 1/wk Yes 1 4\u201312 Yes No 2\u20135\"\" 5 1\u20133 1/wk No 1 4\u201312 Yes No Yes 0 Courses Every day 8 4\u201312 1/wk No 2 >12 No Yes Yes 2\u20135 As needed Every day 9 1\u20133 1/wk No 2 1\u20133 No Yes No 2\u20135 Courses\" 13\"\"\" 2 1\u20133 1/wk No 2 0 No No 1 As needed Every day 18 4\u201312 1/ wk, week."}
