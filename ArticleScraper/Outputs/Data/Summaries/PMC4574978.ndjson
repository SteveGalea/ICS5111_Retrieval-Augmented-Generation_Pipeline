{"summary": "no drugs with broad antiviral activity are available to combat emerging and highly virulent respiratory viruses. the surface proteins of influenza A viruses (FLUAV) and coronaviruses, termed hemagglutinin (HA) and spike (S), facilitate viral binding to host cells and fusion of the viral envelope with a host cell membrane. TMPRSS2 expression was found to be associated with increased risk of severe influenza upon infection with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic virus. TMPRSS2 was shown to activate diverse CoVs [13\u201316], parainfluenza virus [17], human metapneumovirus [18] and hepatitis C virus [19] in cell culture. absence of TMPRSS2 does not compromise development or homeostasis [20], indicating that TMPRSS2- the alignment of amino acid sequences of the N-termini of TMPRSS2 isoform 1 and isoform 2 was constructed using the BLAST server at NCBI. expression plasmids for proteases with an N-terminal myc-tag were PCR-amplified from previously described plasmids. all media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Biochrome), 100 U/ml penicillin and streptomycin (PAN Biotech) the cells were cultured in humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. before propagation in eggs, the FLUAV A/Panama/2007/99 was recovered from a reverse genetics system. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were replaced by infection medium. the cells were fixed with 4% formalin in PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-goat-HRP antibodies (KPL), washed again and incubated for 10 min with True Blue substrate (KPL). cDNA was obtained from pooled tissue samples from 1\u201315 Caucasian donors aged 18\u201369. all PCRs were run for 40 cycles of 30 sec denaturation at 95\u00b0C, 30 sec annealing at 58\u00b0C, and 30 sec elongation at 72\u00b0C. expression of TMPRSS2 isoforms was detected using a mouse anti-myc antibody (Biomol) as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled antibody (Dianova) as the secondary antibody. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding TMPRSS2 isoforms. at 48 h post transfection, the cells were detached, incubated with ice-cold ethanol for 10 min and stained with anti-TMPRSS2 antibody. the mouse IgG1 (R&D Systems) served as isotype-matched control. the cells were harvested in PBS or 250 g/ml tosylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) trypsin (Sigma Aldrich) for 10 min at 37\u00b0C and processed for Western blot analysis. the protein with a C-terminal V5 tag was detected by staining with mouse monoclonal antibody reactive against the V5 tag (Invitrogen) transfection medium was replaced by fresh DMEM after overnight incubation. 293T cells were transiently cotransfected with plasmids encoding ACE2 or DPP4 (2 g), respectively, and indicated proteases (0.3 g) or an empty plasmid as a control. at 24 h post transfection, the cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with DPBS with Ca2+ and Ca2+. fresh infection medium was added to analyze virus release. cells were fixed with ice cold methanol, blocked with 3% BSA. after 1 h of incubation with primary antibodies, cells were washed three times with PBS. cells were stained with Vectashield mounting medium and analyzed with a Zeiss laser scanning microscope. image capture was performed with Pascal Software (Zeiss) and Fiji software was used for image analysis and calculation of Pearson Correlation Coefficient. expression plasmids for proteases with an N-terminal myc-tag were generated by PCR using the above-described plasmids as templates. cell lines 293T (ATCC CRL-3216), Calu-3 (ATCC HTB-55), Caco-2 (ATCC HTB-37), EA-hy (ATCC CRL-2922), BEAS-2b (ATCC CRL-9609), NCI-H292 (ATCC CRL the eggs were euthanized by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. before propagation in eggs, the FLUAV A/Panama/2007/99 was recovered from a reverse genetics system. after 1 h of incubation, the cells were fixed with 4% formalin in PBS and incubated for 1 h with anti-goat-HRP antibodies. cDNA synthesis was performed from 1 g of total RNA, previously treated with DNaseI (Roche) the subsequent PCR was performed using gene-specific primers for tmprss2 transcript variant 1 (forward 5\u2019 GTG AAA GCG GGT GTG AGG A 3\u2019 and reverse 5\u2019CTG TGC GGG ATA GGG GTT TT 3\u2019) and GAPDH (forward 5\u2019 ATG GGG AAG GTG AAG GTC GG 3\u2019 and TMPRSS2 isoforms were detected using a mouse anti-myc antibody (Biomol) as the primary antibody and a horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-coupled antibody (Dianova) as the secondary antibody. expression of -actin, detected with anti-actin antibody (Sigma Aldrich), served as a loading control. 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at 2.8 x105 cells/well. they were then cotransfected with 6 g of plasmid encoding FLUAV HA of the H1 or H3 subtype or SARS-S with a C-terminal V5 tag and 0.1 g of plasmid encoding the indicated proteases. at 48 h post transfection, the cells were harvested in PBS and treated with PBS or 250 293T cells were seeded in T25 cell culture flasks at a density of 7.0 x105 cells/flask, cultured for 24 h and then transfected by calcium phosphate precipitation. the transfection medium was replaced by fresh DMEM after overnight incubation. vector-containing supernatants were harvested at 48 h post transfection. 293T cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 2.8 x105 cells/well. the cells were transiently transfected with 6 g of plasmids encoding TMPRSS2 isoforms or empty plasmid as control. after overnight incubation, the transfection medium was replaced with fresh DMEM. cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 h with DPBS with Ca2+ and Mg2+, supplemented with 0.2% BSA, containing FLUAV at an MOI of 0.5. after 1 h of incubation with primary antibodies, the cells were stained with Vectashield mounting medium (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 5 laser scanning microscope. cloned the transcript variants encoding for each individual isoform. it is unknown whether the proteins are differentially expressed in viral target cells. both proteins were autocatalytically activated. transfected 293T cells were transfected as described for panel B. protease expression was determined using flow cytometry with anti-TMPRSS2 antibody. similar results were obtained in two independent experiments. mRNA levels in muscle and placenta were reduced and no expression of transcript variant 1 was detected in heart and brain. expression pattern of transcript variant 2 was similar but not identical to that of variant 1. all organs and cell lines positive for transcript variant 1 also expressed variant 2 except for muscle tissue. HA and TMPRSS2 isoform 1 colocalize with hemagglutinin. the presence of an extended N-terminus in isoform 1 does not interfere with HA colocalization but might modestly alter the intracellular localization. TMPRSS2 isoform 1 cleaves and activates the influenza virus hemagglutinin. for each experiment, 6\u20138 cells were analyzed. error bars indicate standard error of the mean (SEM) the indicated proteases were transiently expressed in 293T cells. the cells infected with FLUAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) were treated with either trypsin or PBS. at 48 h post infection, the virus release was measured by determination of infectious particles (ffu/ml) in the culture supernatant. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. TMPRSS2 isoform 1 activates the spike protein of SARS- and MERS-coronavirus. it occurs during viral entry into target cells and renders this process independent from the activity of cathepsin L [14\u201316,29,30], an endosomal cysteine protease which can activate SARS-S and MERS-S for entry into TMPRSS2-negative cells [29\u201331]. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the indicated proteases and ACE2 at 48 h post transfection. the results are representative of three independent experiments with different plasmid preparations. isoforms 1 and 2 contain identical transmembrane and extracellular domains. but isoform 1 exhibits an extended N-terminal cytoplasmic domain. it is unknown whether the isoforms are differentially expressed in viral target cells. TMPRSS2 isoforms 1 and 2 were transfected into 293T cells. plasmid encoding TMPRSS2 isoform 1 and isoform 2 were marked with stars. amino acids absent in isoform 2 are marked with stars. transcript variant 2 expressed in lung, kidney, liver and pancreas. mRNA levels in muscle and placenta were reduced and no expression of transcript variant 1 was detected in heart and brain. expression pattern of transcript variant 2 was similar to that of variant 1. TMPRSS2 isoforms 1 and 2 colocalize with hemagglutinin. similar results were obtained in two separate experiments. TMPRSS2 isoforms 1 and 2 colocalize with the influenza A virus. TMPRSS2 isoform 1 cleaves and activates the glycoproteins of influenza A viruses. images were taken at 63 x magnification. similar results were obtained in three separate experiments. expression plasmids encoding FLUAV HA subtypes H1 and H3 were transiently cotransfected into 293T cells. at 48 h post transfection the cells were treated with PBS or trypsin. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. expression of TMPRSS2 isoform 1 markedly increased viral spread to levels observed in the presence of isoform 2. spread was markedly reduced by camostat mesylate, a serine protease inhibitor known to be active against TMPRSS2. TMPRSS2 isoform 1 cleaves and activates the spike protein of SARS- and MERS-coronavirus. TMPRSS2 isoform 1 activates the SARS-coronavirus spike protein. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmid encoding SARS-S. at 48 h post transfection, the cells were treated with PBS or trypsin. tmprss2 gene is located on chromosome 21 and comprises 14 exons and 13 introns [23,24] and two transcript variants were documented at NCBI. isoform 1 is efficiently expressed in transfected cells and exhibits a slightly increased molecular weight relative to isoform 2. two prominent N-terminal fragments were consistently observed for isoform 1 but not for isoform 2. the extended cytoplasmic domain might give rise to the expression of different glycoforms or, maybe more likely, alter the specificity of autocatalytic cleavage. RNA expression data suggest that at least a fraction of the TMPRSS2 molecules present in FLUAV target cells correspond to isoform 1, raising the question whether they contribute to viral activation. the presence of an extended N-terminus does not seem to alter the ability of TMPRSS2 to activate respiratory viruses."}
