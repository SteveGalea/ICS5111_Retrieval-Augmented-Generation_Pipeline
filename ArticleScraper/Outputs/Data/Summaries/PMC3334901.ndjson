{"summary": "subunit vaccines contain one or more semi-pure antigens that are critical in inducing an immune response and 3) the use of metabolically active but non-viable bacteria. the greatest disadvantage of subunit vaccines is their general requirement for strong adjuvants as these adjuvants often induce detrimental tissue reactions. infection with Lm is mainly accompanied by undesired CD4+ T-cell mediated delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses and granulomatous inflammation [10], [11]. an alternative strategy would entail the transfer of a core set of virulence genes from pathogenic Lm to create a strain that is attenuated for virulence but is capable of inducing an effective immune response. the presence of viable bacteria on this day has been shown to be critical for the successful induction of T cell-mediated immunity [15]. bacterial load as well as spleen morphology was analyzed. day 9 corresponds to the primary immune effector phase. 103 cfu Lm, 107 cfu L.inn, or 107 cfu L.inn::vgc strains were infected i.v. with 103 cfu Lm, 107 cfu L.inn, or 107 cfu L.inn::vgc strains. at different time intervals after the infection, mice were sacrificed. wild type L.inn::vgc is engulfed by professional phagocytes like macrophages, dendritic cells, or neutrophils. the levels of IL-1\u00df, IL-6, IL-12, and TNF-alpha in mice sera were measured over the first 4 days after infection with Lm (103), L.inn (107), and the L.inn::vgc strain (107) the numbers of bacteria in spleens at day 3 post-infection were approximately the same. distinct differences in the morphological appearance between spleens isolated from mice infected with Lm and those isolated from mice infected with Lm. granulomas with massive leukocyte aggregates can only be detected in spleens of mice infected with the wild type Lm. granulomas with massive leukocyte aggregates can only be detected in spleens of mice infected with the wild type Lm. the wild type L.inn strain failed to prime T cells for the production of IFN-gamma. both CD4+ (helper, MHC class II restricted) and CD8+ (cytotoxic, MHC class I restricted) T cell subpopulations have been implicated [20]. all non-immunized mice as well as those pre-immunized with L.inn died within 4 days after challenge. survival of mice after challenge was monitored up to 8 days. gen-specific MHC class I restricted effector CD8+ T cells were quantitatively examined. the numbers of antigen-specific MHC class I restricted effector CD8+ T cells induced in mice spleens 9 days after primary infection and 5 days after challenge with the wild type Lm (2103) were determined. infection with wild type Lm as well as the L.inn::vgc strain induced significant numbers of LLO91\u201399 specific CD8+ T-cells. expression of CD44 was upregulated on CD8+ splenocytes 5 days post-challenge infection with the wild type Lm (2103). primary infection with L.inn did not lead to a significant change in CD44 expression pattern. Flow cytometry was performed on spleen cells, isolated from mice. the presence of viable bacteria on this day has been shown to be critical for the successful induction of T cell-mediated immunity [15]. bacterial load as well as spleen morphology was analyzed. on day 3, bacterial load as well as spleen morphology was analyzed. mice were infected with 103 cfu Lm, 107 cfu L.inn, or 107 cfu L.inn::vgc strains. at different time intervals, mice were sacrificed and the number of viable bacteria in the organs was enumerated. significantly higher transcriptional induction of both IFN-a2 and IFN-b1 than wild type L.inn at 2 hours post-infection. this effect was more pronounced at a later time point (8 hours) post-infection reflecting the efficient intracellular survival pattern of the strain. both granuloma formation and delayed-type-hypersensitivity footpad responses have previously been shown to be CD4+ T cell dependent inflammatory responses following infection with Lm. distinct differences in the morphological appearance between spleens isolated from mice infected with Lm and those isolated from mice infected with L.inn::vgc were observed. infiltration of monocytic cells and granulomatous lesions can only be detected in spleens of mice infected with wild type Lm. C. DTH response to listerial antigen 9 days after primary infection. the wild type L.inn strain failed to prime T cells for the production of IFN-gamma. both CD4+ (helper, MHC class II restricted) and CD8+ (cytotoxic, MHC class I restricted) T cell subpopulations have been implicated. all non-immunized mice as well as those pre-immunized with L.inn died within 4 days after challenge. survival of mice after challenge was monitored up to 8 days. the number of antigen-specific MHC class I restricted CD8+ T cells induced in mice spleens 9 days after primary infection and 5 days after challenge with the wild type Lm (2103) was determined by evaluation of the number of IFN- producing CD8+ T cells induced showing reactivity against the dominant H-2Kd restricted LLO91\u201399 epitope [25] in an in vitro ELISPOT assay. infection with wild type Lm as well as the L.in expression of CD44 was upregulated on CD8+ T-cells 5 days post-challenge infection with the wild type Lm (2103). primary infection with L.inn did not lead to a significant change in CD44 expression pattern. cells were stained with FITC-labelled anti-Lyt-2 and biotinylated anti-CD62L. the recombinant strain showed a significant in vivo survival rate in the first 3 days post-infection. this observation is in accordance with our recent finding that the strain is able to survive in phagocytic host cells. the intensity of the morphological and histological alterations in spleens paralleled the level of Listeria-induced DTH responses. we therefore show that the recombinant L.inn::vgc strain shows a significantly reduced proinflammatory and CD4+ mediated inflammatory response compared to Lm. but the crucial question remained as to whether the L.inn::vgc strain elicits significant adaptive immune responses resembling those of the primary infection with the wild type Lm induces down regulation of CD62L on the surface of effector CD8+ T cells. over the following weeks, expression of CD62L is up regulated. in response to primary infection with the different Listeria strains, we examined the induction of LLO91\u201399 specific CD8+ T cells. a non-pathogenic strain of a non-pathogenic L.inn strain expressing genes of the vgc cluster provides robust protection with a single dose of 107 cfu bacteria. the LD50 of the wild type Lm is around 5000 cfu. mice were kept at our breeding facilities in specific-pathogen-free conditions. mice were grown in brain-heart infusion (BHI) broth in presence or absence of 5 g/ml erythromycin. erythromycin was used as a selective antibiotic for growth of L.inn::vgc. bacteria were grown in brain heart infusion (BHI) at 37\u00b0C. the pellet was resuspended in PBS. further dilutions were prepared in PBS to obtain required numbers of bacteria. real-time quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 real time cycler. the relative expression of the targets IFNa2 (Interferon alpha 2) and IFNb1 (Interferon beta) were normalized to that of two reference genes. c (107) strain was performed by an intravenous injection of viable bacteria in a volume of 0.2 ml PBS. the detection limit was 102 colony forming units (CFU) per organ. colonies were counted after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. specific IFN-producing CD8+T cells were determined in the spleens of mice after i.v. infection with the same bacterial strains mentioned above by using an ELISPOT system as previously described [23], [35]. Quantification of IFN-gamma in cell culture supernatants IFN-gamma was measured in the supernatants of splenocytes. animals were sacrificed using CO2 asphyxiation and the appropriate organs aseptically harvested. Mice Six to eight week-old female BALB/c mice were kept at our breeding facilities in specific-pathogen-free conditions. cDNA was synthesized with 500 ng of purified RNA using superScriptII. cDNA was synthesized with 500 ng of purified RNA. cDNA was synthesized with 500 ng of purified RNA. real-time quantitative PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7700 real time cycler. the relative expression of the targets IFNa2 (Interferon alpha 2) and IFNb1 (Interferon beta) were normalized to that of two reference genes. the mean of the fold change of the target versus each of the reference genes was taken as the final value. onies were counted after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. cytokine production was assayed from the collected sera of infected mice. Sera were aseptically isolated on days 1, 2, 3, and 4 post-infection. the assay was performed in duplicates, and data represent means standard error. approximately 1106 splenocytes isolated from infected mice were stained with FITC labelled anti-CD8 and biotinylated anti-CD62L or anti-CD44. mice were infected intraperitoneally with Lm, L.inn and the L.inn::vgc strain. survival was monitored up to 8 days after challenge. cells were stained with FITC-labelled anti-Lyt-2 and PE-labelled anti-CD44."}
