{"summary": "LBW newborns are at greater risk to acquire recurrent bacterial and viral infections during their first few weeks of life. increased risk of infection of LBW as compared to NBW newborns may reflect impairments in innate immunity. over 20 million newborns worldwide, representing 15.5% of all births, are LBW. LBW newborns may be either term LBW (intrauterine growth restriction; gestation age 37 weeks) or pre-term (gestation age 37 weeks) newborns. LBW newborns have lower levels of IgG [13], [14], [15], impaired early IgA and IgM synthesis [15], and lower T- and B- lymphocyte percentage [13], [16], [17] than the NBW newborns. a larger picture comprising exact components and mechanisms involved in defective innate immune signaling in term LBW newborns remains to be drawn. 79 full-term newborns (39 NBW and 40 LBW) and peripheral blood from 8 adults were collected in sterile tubes containing non-pyrogenic anti-coagulant sodium heparin. informed and written consent were taken from parents of each newborn enrolled in the study. RNA labeling and Affymetrix gene chip expression probe array hybridization Genome wide mRNA expression was determined using cord blood leukocytes from eight LBW and four NBW newborns. biotinylated cRNA was prepared from 100 ng of total RNA as per the Affymetrix gene chip expression analysis technical manual. the data files (CEL files) containing the probe level intensities were pre-processed. the GC-RMA analyses converted the probe-level expression data into gene-level expression data. a difference of at-least two fold in the gene expression between NBW and LBW sample were considered for further analysis. the significance of the association between the data set and the canonical pathway was measured using a ratio of the number of genes from the data set that map to the pathway to the total number of genes that map to the canonical pathway. the networks with the highest scores and focus molecules were identified by IPA network analysis. PCR system (Applied Biosystems)/iQTM5 real-time PCR detection system (Bio-Rad) each sample was run in duplicate. the -actin was selected as an internal control. lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. the soluble supernatants were stored at 80\u00b0C. electrophoresis was carried out using 10% polyacrylamide gels. the concentration of IFN- released by cord blood cells of the newborns and peripheral blood cells of the adults in response to R-848 was measured using sandwich human IFN- multi-subtype ELISA kit. the assay was performed in duplicate for each sample. Streptavidin-peroxidase enzyme was diluted and pipetted to each well. plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr followed by 4 times washing with wash buffer. OD of samples was read at 450 nm in an ELISA plate reader (BioRad) RNA extraction from cord blood samples was diluted with 4 volumes of RBC lysis buffer (155 mM NH4Cl, 10 mM KHCO3, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) leukocytes were then washed twice with PBS and lysed using TRI-reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) for RNA extraction as per manufacture's protocol. in-vitro transcription of biotin-labeled cRNA from double-stranded cDNA was carried out using the GeneChip IVT labeling Kit (Affymetrix) hybridized probe arrays were washed and stained with Streptavidin-Phycoerythrin (Molecular Probes) followed by biotinylated anti-streptavidin for linear amplification of signals. the complete sets of raw and normalized data from this study have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus repository. differentially expressed genes identified by Gene Spring were imported into the \u2018interferome\u2019 database to identify the ISGs in LBW newborns. IPA constructed hypothetical gene/protein interactions between our sets of differentially expressed genes refered as the \u2018focus gene\u2019. a score of 2 or higher indicates at least a 99% confidence level of not being generated by random chance alone. RNA from cord blood of 22 LBW and 18 NBW (Table S1) newborns was used for quantitative real time RT-PCR assay. gene forward primer Annealing emperature Product size (base pair) TLR-5 5\u2032ACTCCTGATGCTACTGACAAC 3\u2032 5\u2032GTATAGCATCCCTGGTTTGG 3\u2032 57\u00b0C 59 TLR-8 5\u2032TTATGTGTTCCAGGAACTCAGAGAA 3\u2032 5\u2032TAATACCCAAGTTGATAAGTTTG 3\u2032 58\u00b0C 87 Western blotting analysis Cord blood cells were collected from 12 NBW and 12 LB overnight incubation with primary antibody at 4\u00b0C followed by 2 hrs incubation with rabbit anti-mouse (1:1000) and goat anti-rabbit (1:2000), horseradish peroxidase (HRP) secondary antibody conjugates. proteins detected using enhanced chemiluminescence HRP substrate reagent (Millipore) the absorbance of samples was read at 450 nm in an ELISA plate reader (BioRad) a 4-parameter best fitting standard curve was generated to determine the concentration of IFN- protein. the plate was incubated at room temperature for 1 hr followed by removal of samples and washing one times with wash buffer. a 4-parameter best fitting standard curve was generated to determine the concentration of IFN- protein. culture supernatant concentration of IFN- and BPI protein in adults, NBW and LBW newborns were compared using the Kruskal-Wallis test. the statistical analysis was performed on raw or logarithmically transformed data whichever was appropriate. interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT)-1,-2,-3 and-5 were amongst the most down-regulated genes in LBW newborns. interferon regulatory factor-7 (IRF-7), signal transducer and activator of transcription-2 (STAT-2) and ISG-15 ubiquitin-like modifier-15 (ISG-15) of this network were the most significantly affected transcription factors in the LBW newborns. down 241930_x_at PTPN11 0.0185 2.13 Up 212372_at MYH10 0.0076 2.46 Down 201267_s_at PSMC3 0.0479 2.05 Up 201589_at SMC1A 0.0035 2.39 Down 205170_at STAT2 0.0051 2.39 Down 217502_at IFIT2 0.0066 8.91 Down 201872_s_at ABCE1 0.0404 2.38 Down 219863_at HERC 15 Down 227609_at EPSTI1 0.0009 4.41 Down 203218_at MAPK9 0.0219 2.14 Down 218400_at OAS3 0.0097 4.17 Down 206715_at TFEC 0.0479 2.14 Down 218943_s_at DDX58 0.0104 3.79 Down 204804_at TRIM21 0.0277 2.13 Down 225415_at DTX3L 0.0024 3.39 Down 200934_at DEK 0. the green nodes represent the genes integrated by IPA from its knowledge base. the interferon stimulated genes in this pathway are marked as red diamond. the uncolored nodes represent the genes inferred by IPA from its knowledge base. down-regulated ISGs are the most impacted pathways in LBW newborns.

green nodes represent the genes inferred by IPA from its knowledge base. the interferon stimulated genes in this pathway are marked as red diamond. the uncolored nodes are the genes inferred by IPA from its knowledge base. the shapes legend classifies the proteins found as cytokines/growth factors, transcriptional regulators, enzymes and others. protein kinase R (PKR)/eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2-alpha kinase 2 (EIF2AK2), protein phosphatase-1 catalytic subunit beta isozyme (PPIcB), eukaryotic translation initiation factor-4 gamma-2 (EIF4G2) were down-regulated along with ribosomal protein family genes. down-regulated genes in LBW newborns associated with these infectious diseases were TLR-8, RIG-1 and MDA-5. inflammatory response was an important biological function involving immune response, cell movement of neutrophils, antimicrobial response, and anti-viral response as important sub-categories. other important bio-functions associated with down-regulated genes in LBW newborns were antigen presentation, hematological system development and function. IPA analysis of up-regulated genes data set failed to reveal any significant association with immunological pathways and biofunctions. major histocompatibility complex- and -, and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) were the only differentially expressed genes in LBW newborns which were present in these pathways. all 8 LBW samples and one NBW samples were subjected to real-time RT-PCR. the fold-changes in expression of these genes determined by real time RT-PCR were in concordance with microarray result. gender of the newborn, age of mother, and type of delivery did not result into differences in transcription of the genes validated. the difference in TLR5 and TLR8 expression levels between NBW and NBW newborns was significant; p0.05, (LBW = 12, NBW = 12). production of IFN- is low in response to TLR-8 signaling in LBW newborns. BPI protein level was significantly lower in the uninduced cord blood culture supernatant of LBW newborns compared to that of NBW newborns. intriguingly, BPI protein release was significantly higher in adults. the distinct innate immune system of the LBW newborn is possibly the outcome of weak signaling of genes which work in an integrated manner. any defect in their interaction may lead to an impaired innate immune response, thus predisposing these newborns to various viral and bacterial infections. hypo-responsive to vaccination against Lyme disease [27] and TLR-5 signaling has a protective role against pneumococcal infection in mice [29], [30] decreased TLR-8 expression in monocytes of respiratory syncytial virus-infected newborns dampens early anti-viral cytokine production. this may be due to the impaired TLR-8 signaling. down-regulation of PRRs and IRFs implicated in this pathway could impair cytosolic recognition of viral particles. PKR, a member of eIF2 kinase family, is activated by dsRNA, and arrests cellular and viral protein synthesis by limiting viral replication. down-regulation of PKR and other members of eIF2 signaling may provide a favorable ground for progression of viral infection in the LBW newborns. reduced expression of small and large ribosomal proteins implicated in eIF2 signaling may suggest severe translational dysfunction in the host cell. IFIT's ability to recognize the nucleic acid from a variety of yet-unidentified microbes has been proposed as analogous to the role of TLRs. the observed down-regulation of these genes in the LBW newborns might help explain the severe outcome of viral infections compared to the NBW newborns. inflammatory response, antigen presentation, hematological system development, and immune cell trafficking were important biological processes affected in LBW newborns. the observed down-regulation of chemokine receptors (CCL4) could impair the proper inflammatory response at the site of infection as they play a crucial role in immune cell trafficking. expression of granzyme B due to reduced activity of cord blood NK cells. this finding together with our result provides support for suggesting that the LBW newborns may have low NK cell activity reflected by decreased expression of granzymes and granzyme B. innate immune system mediated adjunctive therapy may help protect LBW newborns from enhanced susceptibility and severity of infections. research into PRRs especially TLR-mediated immunity in this area may have great relevance to clinical practice."}
