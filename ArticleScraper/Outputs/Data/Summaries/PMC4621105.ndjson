{"summary": "the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV is the etiological agent responsible for an outbreak in 2002 to 2003, which caused approximately 10% mortality in the 8,000 people infected worldwide (2). the other human coronaviruses (HCoV) are collectively responsible for about 10 to 30% of common colds. multistep process includes attachment of spike protein (S) to cell surface receptors, endocytosis, and then fusion of the viral and endocytic membranes. viral capsid then undergoes an uncoating process to deliver the viral genome into the cytosol. the viral capsid then undergoes an uncoating process to deliver the viral genome into the cytosol. H1299 cells were propagated in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10 mM HEPES and 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) cells were grown in medium containing 500 g/ml of G418 (Sigma-Aldrich, MO) for 3 weeks before expansion of an antibiotic-resistant cell line (H1299-RL) the commercial siRNA library (Dharmacon siGenome) was spotted in 384-well black Clear plates. cells were transiently transfected at a final concentration of 25 nM per well. cells were dispensed at a density of 3,000 cells per well. annotation information was from Gene Ontology (22), GeneCards (23), and NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene) gene enrichment was analyzed using a combination of STRING (25), Cytoscape, and ScreenSifter. siRNAs for primary and secondary screens were from Dharmacon's siGenome series. cells on coverslips were fixed with 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100, and incubated with the following antibodies. mouse anti-dsRNA (English & Scientific Consulting Bt., Hungary) (1:500), rabbit anti-Flag (Sigma-Aldrich) (1:250), mouse anti-flag (Sigma-Aldrich) (1:250), and mouse anti-EEA1 (BD Biosciences, Franklin infected cells were washed with ice-cold PBS, disrupted using a cell scraper in homogenization buffer (HB) in the presence of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. postnuclear supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 2,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. vero cell-adapted Beaudette strain of recombinant infectious bronchitis virus luciferase (IBV-Luc) was generated by infection of vero cells with IBV-Luc at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of approximately 0.1 in serum-free DMEM followed by 20 h of incubation. medium was removed at 72 h posttransfection and cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline. luminescence signals for both firefly and renilla luciferase activities were acquired with an Infinite M200 luminometer (Tecan, Durham, NC) siRNAs for primary and secondary screens were from Dharmacon's siGenome series. pooled siRNA against arf1, GBF1, CUL3, RBX1, and NEDD8 was from Dharmacon OnTargetPlus. anti-IBV-N, anti-IBV-S, and anti-NS3 antibodies (1:4,000) were raised as previously described. viral plaque assay and 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) method. cells were seeded into 6-well plates 24 h prior to infection with 200 l of 10-fold-serially diluted virus stock. after 1 h of absorption at 37\u00b0C, unbound virus particles were removed. postnuclear supernatant was obtained after centrifugation at 2,000 g for 5 min at 4\u00b0C. crude separation of the endosomal fractions was achieved via a sucrose flotation discontinuous gradient. the suspension was overlaid sequentially with 35% sucrose (2.5 ml), 25% sucrose (2 ml), and finally HB (1.5 ml) firefly luminescence was measured at 16 h postinfection (hpi) at 72 h post-siRNA transfection, cells were infected with IBV-Luc, a recombinant strain of IBV expressing firefly luciferase (20). to assess RNAi-associated cellular toxicity, H1299 cells were stably transfected with renilla luciferase whose signal correlate with cell number. an increasing multiplicity of infection (MOI) only marginally increased firefly luciferase activity. instead, a less efficient infection process due to high cell confluence is a likely explanation. we identified 263 siRNA pools decreasing IBV firefly luciferase activity when silenced. on the other hand, enhancement of virus replication by 130 siRNA pools suggests that the corresponding genes may have protective roles against coronavirus infection. the screen identified two members of the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein family, hnRNP L and hnRNP N3, which have been recently identified to bind to IBV N protein. they are closely related to a known regulator of coronavirus, hnRNP A1 and form part of an interaction network that connects to coronavirus RNA and protein (NSP12) eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3, subunit E (eIF3f), identified in our screen, interacts with six other known coronavirus-interacting proteins. several hits were linked to a cellular compartment GO linked to membranes and were known regulators of membrane traffic processes. DP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1) scored close to the threshold. the related Arf5 scored high in our screen and was recently identified as required for dengue virus (37). these proteins, however, were dispensable for IBV infection (not shown) the UPS is highly represented. our screen results also implicate two other UPS-related proteins. the ternary complex of Vcp-Ufd1L-Npl4 is one of the key mediators of ER-associated degradation process (ERAD) all three components were identified as primary hits in our screen. viral genomic RNA detected in cells treated with siVCP was 2-fold lower than that in controls. antibodies against IBV nucleocapsid protein (IBV-N) were also used to determine expression of viral protein in the absence of VCP. the titer of viral particles released in culture supernatant was determined by the method of median tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per milliliter. the titer of viral particles released from siVCP-treated cells was significantly lower than that in control. VCP knockdown on IBV-N expression at 8 and 16 hpi measured by Western blotting. attached viral particles measured by counting number of CFU by standard plaque assay (D) or via the detection of genomic RNA (+gRNA) levels by RT-PCR (E) quantification of bound virus using reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) did not result in a decreased amount of virus-positive genomic RNA detected on the surface of infected VCP-depleted cells. no significant reduction was detected in VCP-depleted cells, suggesting that VCP is not required for virus entry. cycloheximide (CHX; 100 g/ml) was used as a loading control. -Tubulin was used as a loading control. the cell lysate was probed for IBV-N as well as actin. cells pretreated with proteasome inhibitor MG132 for 2 h prior to infection display significantly increased N protein levels at 4 hpi compared with control and DMSO-treated cells. treatment with either 5 g/ml BFA or 10 M Golgicide A1 did not result in increased N levels, consistent with the GBF1 depletion experiment results. the number of flag-positive vesicular structures was counted in 10 random cells from each treatment group and compared with the control group. infected cells were also costained for the early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1) and numerous and enlarged vesicles positive for EEA1 were observed in siVCP-treated cells. anti-Flag staining revealed that virion-associated IBV-N protein colocalized extensively with these enlarged endosome cluster tubulin and actin were used as loading controls. late and early endosomes were concentrated in the 8%/25% (fractions 2 and 3) and 25%/35% (fractions 5 and 6) interphases. siRNA pool library targeted 21,121 different genes in H1299 cells. rIBV-Luc was infected with firefly and renilla luciferases. a cutoff of 2.5 SD from nontargeting control siRNAs defines hits. to optimize selection, we plotted renilla against firefly average luciferase z-scores. for most wells, there was a direct correlation between the two signals. however, this trend deviated from linearity at higher renilla luciferase values, suggesting that virus production was limited. the remaining 225 siRNA pools were subjected to a validation screen with each of the four siRNAs from the pool tested individually. eighty-three (39%) of these pools had at least two out of four siRNAs that significantly (2 SD) decreased IBV replication compared to the nontargeting control. thus, we propose that the 83 corresponding genes are host factors required for IBV infection. the screen identified two members of the heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family, hnRNP L and hnRNP N3, which have been recently identified to bind to IBV N protein. they are closely related to a known regulator of coronavirus, hnRNP A1 and form part of an interaction network that connects to coronavirus RNA and protein (NSP12) several hits were linked to a cellular compartment GO linked to membranes. among them are Vps4B, also known as the charged multivesicular protein 4b (CHMP4B), and the Golgi apparatus-associated brefeldin A (BFA)-resistant GEF 1 (GBF1), which has been shown to be required for multiple viruses. the requirement for Cul3, Rbx1 and Nedd8 was confirmed with an independent secondary assay using Western blot analysis against viral protein at 16 hpi but also 8 hpi. a reduction in viral protein expression is associated with knockdown of these genes at both time points, suggesting a requirement for these proteins during early infection stages. this is consistent with previous findings on the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors on CoV replication (41, 42) the 4 individual siRNAs in the pool (siVCP-05, -06, -07, and -08) reduced IBV-Luc activity by 13-, 10-, 4-, and 6-fold, respectively. this siRNA was used in subsequent experiments. VCP is required for human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) infection. 7 cells transfected with nontargeting siRNA (siNT) or VCP siRNA (siVCP) were observed for cytopathic effect under a light microscope after 48 h of HCoV-229E infection (top panel) cells were also fixed, infected, and stained for dsRNA expression and nuclei by Hoechst staining. effect of valosin-containing protein (VCP) on IBV-Luc replication at 10 or 16 hpi. Error bars represent SDs from average luciferase activity from two independent experiments with duplicates. BV-S and IBV-N proteins were also associated with VCP depletion. syncytium formation was evident in nontargeting siRNA (siNT)-treated control cells. VCP is not required for viral attachment to cell surface and virus entry. we observed higher levels of N protein in VCP-depleted cells at 4 hpi. this effect is transient, as by 8 hpi, N protein levels in control cells were dramatically increased over those at 4 hpi. this effect is transient, as by 8 hpi, N protein levels in control cells were dramatically increased over those at 4 hpi. in cells pretreated with 10 g/ml of cycloheximide, levels of N protein were not affected in control or siVCP-treated cells. in contrast, at 8 h, these levels were dramatically reduced in control cells, indicating that most of the N protein detected at this time point is neosynthesized. these data suggest that IBV-N associated with infecting virions is degraded at early stages of infection. virion-associated N protein (VCP) depletion leads to accumulation of viral particles in early endosome vesicles. in this model, VCP would act after the release of the viral nucleoprotein from the endosomal system. however, during this study, VCP was reported to be implicated in endosomal maturation after VCP depletion (45, 46) tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate [TRITC], red) or anti-Flag (fluorescein isothiocyanate [FITC], green) for 4 h, fixed, permeabilized, and stained for EEA1 (tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate [TRITC], red) a magnified view of colocalized particles is provided in the square inset. CP was silenced, viral RNA was nearly undetectable in late endosome fractions. instead, viral RNA was observed to accumulate in early endosomes (fraction 5) together with EEA1. these results suggest that in the absence of VCP, the infecting virus accumulates in an early endosomal compartment. the ATP-binding cassette subfamily E member 1 gene was an important and confirmed hit. the encoded protein has been proposed to bind to and inhibit RNase L. it is part of the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)\u2013RNase L pathway. it is activated in response to interferon and results in a block of protein synthesis and the promotion of viral RNA degradation (48). VCP depletion revealed a previously uncharacterized transient degradation of the virion-associated N protein. it is possible that this degradation is required for the cytosolic release of the viral RNA genome. the exact mechanism by which VCP facilitates N protein degradation is also currently unclear. proposes a function for VCP in membrane fusion and early endosome maturation. another report implicates VCP in the extraction and translocation of the polyubiquitinated mannose receptor from endosomes to the cytosol (59). a complex of VCP and UBXD1 has also been shown to regulate endolysosomal sorting of ubiquitylated caveolin-1 (55)"}
