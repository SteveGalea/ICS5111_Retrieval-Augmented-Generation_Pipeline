{"summary": "sfRNA suppresses RNA interference (RNAi) in both mammalian and insect cells. sfRNA acts as a decoy for Dicer during processing of double-stranded RNA. this results enhance an understanding of noncoding RNAs as modulators of innate immunity. the prototype baculovirus elicits a proapoptotic DNA damage response in diverse insects. this manipulation, coupled with virus-mediated suppression of apoptosis, enables baculoviruses to exploit crucial aspects of the DNA damage response. the cellular signals that lead to viral reactivation are not well understood. the results suggest that an effective HIV-1 vaccine should elicit effector and terminal effector memory CD8+ T-cell responses."}
