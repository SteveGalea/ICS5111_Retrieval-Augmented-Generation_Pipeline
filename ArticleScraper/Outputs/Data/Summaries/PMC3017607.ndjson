{"summary": "programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) is a process where specific signals in the mRNA direct the ribosome to switch reading frame at a certain efficiency. in 1 PRF, the ribosome slips 1 nt towards the 5\u2032-end of the mRNA during translation. the ribosome selects the cognate aminoacyl-tRNA (aa-tRNA) according to the codon at the decoding center. the ribosome catalyses peptidyltransfer, resulting in a peptidyl tRNA in the A-site and a deacylated tRNA in the P-site. a shift in reading frame may occur at the first TL step. three major models have been proposed for the mechanism of 1 PRF. one hypothesis proposes that 1 PRF takes place during accommodation of the aa-tRNA (8,15,16) a 1 PRF stimulating pseudoknot can interact with the ribosome to block the mRNA entrance channel, compromising the translocation process during 1 PRF (24). this model suggests incomplete translocation promotes formation of a transition intermediate, and that entry of the new aa-tRNA into the ribosome drives the shift in reading frame. u (derived from decoding the 0-frame UUU UUA sequence) 30% of the products contained Phe\u2013Phe (derived from decoding the 1 frame UUU UUU sequence) at the frameshift site (1,25,26) previous studies suggested that the product with Phe\u2013Phe could result from slippage of the P-site tRNA alone (1,25,26) Figure 1 describes the overall framework using abc deX XXY YYZ fgh sequence as an example. when 1 PRF occurs during translocation, the presence of the downstream stimulatory structure forces the ribosome to translocate by two, rather than three, bases toward the 3\u2032-end of the mRNA. if this \u2018incomplete\u2019 translocation occurs to the pre-translocational ribosome aligning with deX XXY, translation of the 1 frame -tRNA involves initial binding of the ternary complex EF-Tu:aa-tRNA:GTP, codon recognition, EF-Tu GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis, dissociation of EF-Tu from the ribosome and accommodation of the acceptor end of the aa-tRNA into the A-site. elongation cycle without a \u20131 PRF event results in synthesis of non-frameshift proteins (NF pathways Ia suggests that \u20131 PRF occurs during the second translocation step, resulting in FSz production. in pathway I, blockage of the mRNA channel entrance induces incomplete translocation with the pre-translocational ribosome. XY and E02P02 are the post-translocational ribosome aligning with cde XXX (\u20131 frame) subscript 0 means a zero frame tRNA pairing with the 1 frame. E0P0 may generate non-frameshift product NFS, or enter Pathway II or III described below. the mechanistic model in the present study successfully described the effects of ribosome interactions on +1 PRF (27) a similar approach can be applied to understand the mechanism of 1 PRF. selection and accommodation of aa-tRNA involves initial binding of the ternary complex EF-Tu:aa-tRNA:GTP, codon recognition, EF-Tu GTPase activation, GTP hydrolysis, dissociation of EF-Tu from the ribosome and accommodation of the acceptor end of the aa-tRNA into the A-site. the process from PA to E0P0 represents translocation, which involves r1, r pathway I suggests that \u20131 PRF occurs during the relocking step in the first translocation, leading to the formation of FSz. pathway III suggests that \u20131 PRF occurs during the second translocation step, resulting in FSz production. E0P0 is the post-translocational ribosome aligning with deX XXX (\u20131 frame) and E02P02 is the post-translocational ribosome aligning with cde XXX (\u20131 frame), where subscript 0 means a zero frame tRNA pairing with the 1 frame. E0P0 may generate non-frameshift product NFS, or enter Pathway II or III described below. the pathway I slip occurs one elongation cycle before the Pathway III slippage event. a program was developed in Matlab v.R2008a to perform an n-way analysis of variance. bacterial strains Escherichia coli XL1 blue MRF\u2032 (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) were used in all experimental studies. all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing at the Cornell Bioresource Center. fluorescence was measured using a plate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) a total of 23\u201346 replicates for test strains were performed to satisfy the minimum sample requirement for statistical significance. trypsin-digested frameshift protein samples resulted in target peptides spanning the recoding sites with a single amino acid difference between FSz and FSm. sample was vacuum dried, reconstituted with 30 l of 0.1% formic acid (FA) and a portion of each reconstituted sample was injected into Dionex 3000 nLC system (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) spectral assignment of MS/MS was performed under parameters of MS tolerance of 1.2 Da, MS/MS tolerance of 0.6 Da and P 0.05. areas of peaks representing different charge states of a given peptide were summed for their usage in calculating the fraction of FSm (%) [Equation (3)]. each parameter in the model was varied over five levels. a base line value, 25% of the base line, a 50% of the base line. randomly selected 10 000 parameter sets were used to calculate FS%. fluorescence measured using a plate reader (SpectraMax M5, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) fluorescence measured using a plate reader. a total of 23\u201346 replicates for test strains and control strains were performed. cells were lysed and purified by Ni-NTA under native conditions. purified protein samples were resolved by SDS\u2013PAGE (10% w/v polyacrylamide) gel band excision and in-gel trypsin digestion were performed. the MIDAS Workflow software (Applied Biosystems) generated a list of possible MRM transitions before MS analysis. the spectral assignment of MS/MS was performed under parameters of MS tolerance of 1.2 Da, MS/MS tolerance of 0.6 Da and P 0.05. the results were manually confirmed. both levels of FSm and FSz increase when rt increases. increasing rt results in a larger FSm fraction. majority of FSz comes from Pathway III when rt is 2 s1, while majority of FSz is from pathway II. the effect of incomplete translocation during the first elongation cycle (represented by rt) on \u20131 PRF. all other parameters are assumed to be constant. in Pathway II, 1 PRF occurs during aa-tRNA accommodation. when kpas2 is >3 s1 (Figure 6b) the effect of incomplete translocation during the second elongation cycle (represented by rt3) on \u20131 PRF. the effect of kpas2 on the level of frameshift efficiency (FS%, blue line), frameshift protein incorporating a \u20131 frame aa-tRNA at the recoding site. the model predicts that a decrease in kpt would result in a higher FS% due to increased production of FSz. in this scheme, the majority of FSz is synthesized from Pathway II when kpt is 15 s1, while the majority of FSz comes from pathway III when kpt is >15 s1. a smaller kpt should cause higher FS% and a lower fraction of FSm. a prior study using yeast demonstrated that inhibition of peptidyltransfer promoted increased rates of 1 PRF. the model predicts that addition of chloramphenicol, a potent peptidyltransferase inhibitor in bacteria should promote increased FS%. the frameshift sequence for HIV-1 is U AAU UUU UUA. a space separates each zero frame codon and the P-site of the recoding site is underlined. in the MB2UCC strain, the sequence was mutated to C CCU UUU UUA. the extended frameshift sequence for HTLV-1 pro-pol is C CCU UUA AAC. the tRNAGGGPro can potentially form three canonical base pairings with the 1 frame CCC. a significant amount of FSm among total frameshift proteins can be produced. the rate constant r45 accounts for the relocking step during translocation. a decrease in r45 while other parameters in the model remain constant results in an increase in FS% (blue line in Figure 5a) both the levels of FSm and FSz increase when r45 decreases (green and red lines in Figure 5a) however, in this case the increase in the FSm level is larger, leading to a larger FSm fraction with a decrease in r45 the effect of r45 on the fraction of FSm and FSz. in Pathway II, 1 PRF occurs during aa-tRNA accommodation. the slippage occurs before peptidyltransfer. frameshift protein incorporating a \u20131 frame aa-tRNA at the recoding site (FSm, green line) and frameshift protein incorporating a zero frame aa-tRNA at the recoding site (FSz, red line) in pathway III, 1 PRF occurs during translocation while the pre-translocational complex is aligned with XXY YYZ. a higher rt3 promotes increased FS%. the majority of FSz is synthesized from Pathway II when kpt is 15 s1, while the majority of FSz comes from pathway III when kpt is >15 s1. the model predicts that a smaller kpt should cause higher FS% and a lower fraction of FSm. a 2.1-fold increase in FS%exp was observed in the E. coli culture containing 0.75 g/ml chloramphenicol compared to the culture without the drug. the fractions of FSm for the culture with and without chloramphenicol were 17.3 and 20.4%, respectively. MB2UCC strain, the sequence was mutated to U CCU UUU UUA. the E-site tRNAGGGPro can potentially form three canonical base pairings with the 1 frame CCC. a larger rt should result in a higher FS% due to increased production of FSm. a significant amount of FSm among total frameshift proteins can be produced. this is the first kinetic model to explain the production of two types of 1 frameshift proteins through three distinct kinetic pathways. a pre-translocational ribosome aligning with deX XXY may shift reading frame during incomplete translocation. frameshifting at the HIV-1 sequence was reported to generate 70% FSz and 30% FSm (1,25) pathways II and/or III exert stronger influence on FS% than Pathway I. this is the first study to demonstrate another frameshift sequence that generates a significant amount of FSm in addition to HIV-1. products from other 1 PRF signals were analysed previously (39,40) both FSz and FSm were identified in the frameshift products. experimental results indicate that 20.4 and 39.4% of frameshift proteins are FSm, i.e. the contribution of Pathway I. incomplete translocation at the pre-translocational ribosome aligning with XXY YYZ resulted in more FSz (Pathway III), consistent with the models proposed by Weiss et al. (23) and Namy et al. (22). enhancing incomplete translocation in Pathway III decrease the fraction of FSm. mutations affecting the composition of frameshift proteins have been reported in the literature. in one case, FS% increases significantly without a change in the composition of frameshift products. in another condition FS% increases a smaller amount but the composition of frameshift products change dramatically. a similar kinetic approach can be used to understand the effect of sequential tRNA movement on the overall process. one step tRNA movement (Rx.1) Sequential tRNA movement (Rx.2) Assuming steady state, rt and r\u2013t can be represented by rt1, r\u2013t1, rt2 and r\u2013t2 (Supplementary Data) the model identifies the dominant parameters, representing steps in the translation elongation cycle, on 1 PRF. alterations of these kinetic parameters can affect not only changes in frameshift efficiency, but also changes in the composition of frameshift products under different conditions."}
