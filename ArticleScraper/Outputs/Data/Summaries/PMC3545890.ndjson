{"summary": "absence of CD4 T cells decreases CD8 T cell activity and impedes viral control in the central nervous system. absence of B7-H1 enhances CD8 T-cell function and accelerates viral control, but increases morbidity. the local requirement of CD4 T-cell help for CD8 T-cell function is not overcome if B7-H1 inhibitory signals are lost. the increased effector activity by CD8 T cells in the CNS of B7-H1/ mice is attributable to the absence of B7-H1 upregulation on major histocompatibility complex class I-presenting resident target cells. oligodendroglia, which are prominent targets of infection, strongly upregulate the ligand B7-H1 in response to IFN- during infection. oligodendroglia, which are prominent targets of infection, strongly upregulate the ligand B7-H1 in response to IFN- during infection. oligodendrocytes were shown to upregulate major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I, but not MHC class II during JHMV infection. demyelination was similar to infected wild-type (WT) mice [23], suggesting that the absence of B7-H1 did not overtly increase the vulnerability of oligodendrocytes to immune attack. the absence of CD4 T cells in B7-H1/ mice did not affect demyelination or significantly lessen axonal damage. the absence of CD4 T cells in B7-H1/ mice did not affect demyelination. control animals received the same amount of control mAb GL113. animals were scored daily for clinical signs of disease on a four-point scale. titers and cytokine determination. Isolation of mononuclear cells CNS-derived cells isolated as described earlier. brains or spinal cords from PBS-perfused mice (n = 3 to 6) were homogenized in ice-cold Tenbroeck tissue grinders in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS. cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI supplement with 25 mmol/l HEPES, adjusted to 30% Percoll (Pharmacia, Piscataway, ophycocyanin-conjugated mAbs specific for CD45 (30-F11), CD4 (L3T4), CD8 (53\u20136.7) CD44 (IM7), CD62L (MEL-14) were identified using Db/S510 MHC class I tetramers (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) as described previously. 4CD44loCD62Lhi cells were also purified from pooled CLNs. a minimum of 5 104 cells were collected per pooled sample. axonal integrity was examined using the -phosphorylated neurofilament mAb SMI-31. microglia and infiltrating macrophages were identified by immunoperoxidase staining using the -JHMV mouse mAb J.3.3 as the primary antibody, horse -mouse as secondary antibody and 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) as substrate. with exception of the LFB staining, all sections were counterstained with hematoxylin. cDNA was synthesized from RNA using reverse transcriptase (M-MLV; Invitrogen) and random primers. PCR conditions were 10 minutes at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. Graphs were plotted and statistics assessed using GraphPad Prism software (version 3.0). ethics approval All procedures were conducted in accordance with animal protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. cytokine determination Virus titers within the brain were determined in clarified supernatants by plaque assay. 96 well plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 100 l of 1 g/ml of -IFN-. non-specific binding was blocked with 10% fetal calf serum in PBS for 1.5 h. cell pellets were resuspended in RPMI supplemented with 25 mmol/l HEPES. cells were recovered from the 30/70% interface, washed once, and resuspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer. cells were incubated with mouse serum and rat -mouse FcIII/II mAb. Virus-specific CD8 T cells were identified using Db/S510 MHC class I tetramers (Beckman Coulter Inc., Fullerton, CA, USA) for intracellular detection of granzyme B or IFN-, the cells were stained for cell surface markers before permeabilization. 2 106 CLN cells were cultured in absence or presence of 1 mol/l S510 peptide. cells were stained for surface expression of CD8, CD44, and CD62L. cells were then permeabilized to detect intracellular IFN-. immunoperoxidase staining was performed on paraffin embedded sections. images were viewed using ImageScope software (Aperio) for semi-quantitative analyses, sections were scored in a blinded fashion. quantitative real-time PCR was performed using 4 l of cDNA and SYBR Green. PCR conditions were 10 minutes at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds, 60\u00b0C for 30 seconds and 72\u00b0C for 30 seconds. CD4 T cell depletion was delayed until day 4 p.i. in B7-H1/ mice. in CD4-depleted B7-H1/ mice, loss of viral control was evident at day 10 p.i., but was much more pronounced by day 14 p.i. relative to undepleted mice. glial morphology was increased in the spinal-cord white matter of CD4-depleted B7-H1/ mice. oligodendroglial cells were confirmed by double immunoperoxidase labeling with an oligodendroglial marker (-GST) and anti-viral nucleocapsid antibody. arrows point to virus-infected oligodendroglial cells (double-labeled), adjacent to non-infected oligodendroglial cells. arrows point to virus-infected oligodendroglial cells (double-labeled) B7-H1/ infected mice were treated with -CD4 or control -gal monoclonal antibody at 4 and 6 days post-infection (p.i.) CNS-infiltrating cells were analyzed by flow cytometry from pooled brains. in CD8 T cells purified from the CNS of CD4-depleted mice. transcript levels of perforin were reduced by around 2-fold. IL-10 expression was also assessed, as highly lytic CD8 T cells were recently associated with high IL-10 production. mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of granzyme B in tetramer+ CD8 T cells is shown in the upper right-hand quadrant. data represent the mean SEM (n 6/group) of two separate experiments. less than 10% of CNS-derived CD4 T cells initially expressed PD-1 at day 5 p.i. this percentage rapidly increased to 60% by day 7 p.i. and 80% by day 14 p.i. IFN- levels in CD44hiCD62Llo cells were around 3-fold higher in the absence of B7-H1 at 5 days p.i. similar trend was apparent for IL-10 mRNA levels, which were increased by less than 2-fold in B7-H1/ CD4 T cells. IL-21, a positive regulator of CD8 T cells, was the only cytokine that was specifically higher in the CNS-derived but not in CLN-derived CD4 T cells GAPDH 1000 are presented as fold change with levels from WT samples set at 1. Expression levels relative to GAPDH were as follows: IFN- = 60; IL-10 = 55; IL-21 = 41; and IL-2 = 1.1. the absence of B7-H1 on infected macrophages may thus directly underlie the enhanced CD4 T-cell effector activity in the CNS. transcripts encoding the viral nucleocapsid protein were higher in CD45lo microglia and CNS CD45hiF4/80+ macrophages isolated from CD4-depleted mice. transcript levels are relative to GAPDH 1000. data support a contribution of CD4 T cells, either directly or indirectly, via enhancement of CD8 T-cell effector function in controlling virus in microglia/macrophages that express MHC class II. in virus-specific CD8 T cells, the levels of granzyme B were comparable between unhelped B7-H1/ and helped WT populations at days 7 and 10 p.i. unhelped ex vivo CD8 T-cell effector activity in B7-H1/ mice is comparable with helped WT CD8 T cells at day 7 p.i. thus, B7-H1 blockade directly increases CD8 T-cell activity in the absence of CD4 T cells. litis in B7-H1/ mice is associated with increased morbidity and axonal damage within the demyelinated lesions compared with WT mice. this data was initially attributed to enhanced CD8 T-cell function mediated by release from B7-H1 interactions with infected oligodendrocytes. however, the absence of more severe demyelination posed a conundrum [15]. disease severity and mortality rates were similar to control B7-H1/ mice. CD4 depletion increases survival of B7-H1/ mice. quantitative analysis of axonal staining (SMI-31 plus SMI-32) showed significantly less staining in B7-H1/ mice (18.1% axonal area) compared with WT controls (26.1% axonal area) indicating more axonal loss (P0.02) iNOS expression in microglia and macrophages from CD4-depleted B7-H1/ mice was similar to those of the CD4-competent WT counterparts. expression of mac-3, a marker associated with myeloid cell activation, was assessed to further support the role of IFN- in microglia/macrophage activation. yelination after treatment with -CD4 or control -galactosidase monoclonal antibody. lesions showed more extensive axonal damage in B7-H1/ mice. lesions appeared to have reduced axonal loss. B7-H1 deficiency does not compensate for the essential anti-viral role of CD4 T-cell help. aid is required for efficient priming and expansion of virus-specific CD8 T cells in CLNs. CD4 T cell depletion was delayed until day 4 p.i. in B7-H1/ mice. the number of virus-infected cells exhibiting glial morphology was increased in the spinal-cord white matter of CD4-depleted B7-H1/ mice. frquent infection of oligodendroglial cells was confirmed by double immunoperoxidase labeling with an oligodendroglial marker (-GST) and anti-viral nucleocapsid antibody (J.3.3) rabbit -glutathione S-transferase antibody labeling oligodendrocytes. Arrows point to virus-infected oligodendroglial cells adjacent to non-infected oligodendroglial cells. impaired viral control in CD4-depleted B7-H1/ mice results from diminished local CD8 T-cell function. infected mice were treated with -CD4 or control -gal monoclonal antibody at 4 and 6 days post-infection. IFN- production specifically in CD8 T cells in vivo was supported by 2 and 3-fold lower IFN- transcript levels specifically in CD8 T cells purified from the CNS of CD4-depleted mice. transcript levels of perforin were reduced by around 2-fold (Figure 3C), correlating with diminished granzyme B expression in CD4-depleted B7-H1/ mice. mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of granzyme B in Db/S510 tetramer+ CD8 T cells is shown in upper right-hand quadrant. data represent the mean SEM (n 6/group) of two separate experiments. less than 10% of CNS-derived CD4 T cells initially expressed PD-1 at day 5 p.i. this percentage rapidly increased to 60% by day 7 p.i. and 80% by day 14 p.i. IL-21 were either undetectable or were below values of 0.1 in CD4 T cells expressing a nave CD44loCD62Lhi phenotype. similar to the CNS, IFN- levels in CD44hiCD62Llo cells were around 3-fold higher in the absence of B7-H1 at 5 days p.i. a similar trend was apparent for IL-10 mRNA levels, which were increased by less than 2-fold in B7-H1/ transcript levels relative to GAPDH 1000 are presented as fold change. expression levels were as follows: IFN- = 60; IL-10 = 55; IL-21 = 41; and IL-2 = 1.1. data depict the mean SEM of two independent experiments. around 60% of macrophages expressed B7-H1 at 7 days p.i. whereas B7-H1 expression was transient on microglia, it was sustained on the majority at day 14 p.i. numbers represent percentages of B7-H1 positive cells relative to isotype controls. data are representative of two independent experiments with similar trends. transcript levels are relative to GAPDH 1000. IL-10 transcripts were equivalent in unhelped CD8 T cells from B7-H1/. compared with helped WT CD8 T cells at day 7 p.i., but reduced by 60% at day 10 p.i. CD4 T cells are mediators of exacerbated disease in B7-H1/ mice JHMV encephalomyelitis in B7-H1/ mice is associated with increased morbidity and axonal damage within the demyelinated lesions. this data were initially attributed to enhanced CD8 T-cell function mediated by release from B7-H1 interactions with infected oligodendrocytes. depleting B7-H1/ mice of CD8 T cells coincident with JHMV infection. disease severity and mortality rates were similar to control B7-H1/ mice. CD4 T cells did not affect the overall size or number of focal demyelinating lesions in either WT or B7-H1/ mice. axonal staining (SMI-31 plus SMI-32) showed significantly less staining in B7-H1/ mice (18.1% axonal area) compared with WT controls. depletion of CD4 T cells in both WT and B7-H1/ mice reduced iNOS transcripts, consistent with the decreased levels of IFN- in the CNS. expression of mac-3, a marker associated with myeloid cell activation, was assessed to further support the role of IFN- in microglia/macrophage activation with decreased axonal damage. stained with Luxol fast blue LFB (to identify areas of myelin loss) in wild-type (WT) and B7-H1/ mice show similar extent of demyelination after treatment with -CD4 or control -galactosidase (-gal) monoclonal antibody (mAb) lesions showed more extensive axonal damage in B7-H1/ mice. CD4 T cells play a supportive role for CD8 T cells that is less well understood. effector functions by both T-cell subsets are regulated by inhibitory interactions in a cell type-specific manner. reduced expression of perforin and IFN- transcripts and granzyme B by CNS-derived B7-H1/ unhelped CD8 T cells coincided with loss of CNS viral control at day 10 p.i. the sustained viral loads are likely responsible for the increased CNS numbers of total CD8 T cells at day 14 p.i. relative to control mice. however, CD4-depleted B7-H1/ mice harbored at least 10-fold lower viral tit NS of B7-H1/ mice has also been reported in the experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) model. increased IFN- and IL-10 mRNA was already imprinted during priming in CLNs. enhanced local CNS restimulation was supported by the specific increase of IL-21 transcripts and the overall 5-fold higher IFN- and IL-10 transcript levels in the CNS. CD4 T-cell depletion indicated these lymphocytes as primary mediators of exacerbated disease in B7-H1/ mice. this was supported by the inability of CD8 T-cell depletion to ameliorate disease in B7-H1/ mice. this was supported by the inability of CD8 T-cell depletion to ameliorate disease in B7-H1/ mice. reduced iNOS mRNA expression and reduced Mac-3 reactivity in the CNS of CD4-depleted B7-H1/ mice supports a direct contribution of CD4-mediated microglia/macrophage activation to disease severity and mortality. iNOS synthesizes the free radical nitric oxide (NO), which is implicated in pathologic processes due to its cytotoxicity at high concentrations. PD-1:B7-H1 blockade is thus insufficient to overcome CD4 T cell helper function to CD8 T cells during JHMV infection. if not regulated by B7-H1:PD-1 interactions, the authors declare no competing financial interests. we sincerely thank Wenqiang Wei and Eric Barron for their exceptional technical assistance.
