{"summary": "human noroviruses (NoV) cause illness in an estimated 19 to 21 million people in the united states each year. noV is responsible for 73% to 95% of epidemic nonbacterial gastroenteritis cases worldwide (2). noV is the leading cause of food-borne illness in the united states (3). there is currently no practical method for culturing NoV (15, 16, 17); therefore, several related viruses have been used as surrogates for noV. the use of MNV as a NoV surrogate has also been supported by previous studies conducted with various disinfectants using multiple NoV surrogates. a few studies have compared the antiviral efficacies of plant antimicrobials with both enveloped and nonenveloped viruses. hydroxytyrosol, a phenolic compound extracted from olive trees, was effective against several strains of enveloped influenza A and Newcastle disease virus. grape seed extract (66, 67), cranberry juice (68, 69), cranberry proanthocyanidins (68), pomegranate juice (70) and pomegranate phenolic extracts (PPE) (70) were evaluated in several studies. treatment with grape seed extract reduced NoV specific binding to Caco-2 cells by >1.0 log10 genomic copies/ml (67) and hepatitis A virus (HAV) cell culture infectivity titrations were performed using the Reed-Muench method (75) to determine the viral dilution in which 50% of the wells containing cells were visibly affected (the 50% tissue culture infective dose [TCID50]). of 50 l of each dilution was used to inoculate eight replicate wells. each well was checked every day for 5 days for cytopathic effects. the highest dilution in which 50% of the wells exhibited CPE was used. allspice oil, lemongrass oil, and citral were evaluated in separate experiments at concentrations of 2.0% and 4.0% (vol/vol) the results from these experiments were found to be consistent and repeatable. a solution containing the desired concentration of the antimicrobial was placed into either DMEM-FBS or PBS (1 ml into 9 ml) the solution was mixed thoroughly and then approximately 1 107 TCID50 of MNV was added. if the antimicrobials were completely neutralized in the DMEM-FBS or PBS solution, there would be no reduction in MNV numbers. the other two tubes were stored at 80\u00b0C until used in a cell binding experiment (Fig. 1, tube C with DMEM-FBS) to assess the ability of the treated MNV to bind to host RAW 264.7 cells and for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Fig. 1, tube D with PBS) to directly observe any physical changes to the MNV particles following antimicrobial treatments. l of the ZR viral RNA buffer should denature the enzyme. -mercaptoethanol (BME) was added to each sample to inhibit RNases. reverse transcription (RT) step was performed using high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kits. the qPCR amplification was performed using a lightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument II (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) the qPCR amplification was performed using a lightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument II (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany) the qPCR was performed as described previously for the PV1 process control (an enterovirus) a cell binding experiment was performed to assess the ability of the MNV treated with the plant antimicrobials to bind to host cells. the cells were rinsed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) and then the TBS was removed. this assay results in a 143-bp product (82). cell binding assay for murine norovirus (MNV) treated with either lemongrass oil, citral, or allspice oil. numerous controls included in duplicate wells. the cells were washed three times with TBS to remove any unbound virus particles or virus RNA. then an additional 198 l of PBS was added to each well. the extracts were used as the template in the MNV and PV1 RT-qPCR assays. the data were reported as the logarithmic reduction in infectivity using the formula log10 (Nt/N0), where N0 was the concentration of MNV particles measured via cell culture infectivity at time zero and Nt was the infectious particle concentration at time t. Differences were considered statistically significant if the t test resulted in a P value of 0.05. MNV (strain S7-PP3) was propagated on RAW 264.7 (ATCC TIB-71) cell line monolayers. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. each well was checked every day for 5 days for cytopathic effects (CPE) the highest dilution in which 50% of the wells exhibited CPE was used to determine the virus TCID50/ml. allspice oil, lemongrass oil, and citral were evaluated in separate experiments at concentrations of 2.0% and 4.0% (vol/vol) the results from these experiments were found to be consistent and repeatable. concentration of the antimicrobial was placed into either DMEM-FBS or PBS (1 ml into 9 ml) solution was mixed thoroughly and then approximately 1 107 TCID50 of MNV was added. if the antimicrobials were completely neutralized in the DMEM-FBS or PBS solution, it was expected that there would be no reduction in MNV numbers. a cell binding experiment (Fig. 1, tube C with DMEM-FBS) was used to assess the ability of the treated MNV to bind to host RAW 264.7 cells and for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging (Fig. 1, tube D with PBS) to directly observe any physical changes to the MNV particles following antimicrobial treatments. at each time exposure, four 50-l volumes were removed from each of the replicate test tubes. a volume of 2 l of purified PV1 (2.0 106 genome copies total) was added to each sample. reverse transcription (RT) step was performed using high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kits (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) concentrations of the primers MNV-S (5\u2032-CCGCAGGAACGCTCAG-3\u2032) and 300 nM TaqMan MGB probe MNV-TP (5\u2032-FAM-ATGAGTGATGGCA-MGB-NFQ-3\u2032) qPCR amplification was performed using a lightCycler 480 real-time PCR instrument II (Roche Diagnostics) denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles with denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 15 s and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0C for 1 min. assay results in a 143-bp product (82). controls included in the cell binding assay for murine norovirus (MNV) treated with either lemongrass oil, citral, or allspice oil. to determine the normal amt of cell binding by MNV Negative control 1 RAW 264.7 cells without virus To ensure that the nucleic acid from the RAW 264.7 cells is not amplified by the MNV. the extracts were used as the template in the MNV and PV1 RT-qPCR assays. the 1-h incubation period at 4\u00b0C does not allow for viral replication or the development of any CPE in the cells. this therefore was used to determine the number of viruses that were able to bind to the cells. the logarithmic reduction in infectivity was reported using the formula log10 (Nt/N0), where N0 was the concentration of MNV particles measured via cell culture infectivity at time zero and Nt was the infectious particle concentration at time t. differences were considered statistically significant if the t test resulted in a P value of 0.05. RESULTS Antimicrobial neutralization and cytotoxicity experiments. no reductions in MNV were observed in the neutralization tests. this method was confirmed to completely neutralize the antimicrobials at these concentrations. at least a 2.0-log10 reduction (range of 2.19 log10 to 3.00 log10) there were no statistically significant differences (P > 0.05) between the reductions observed between lemongrass oil and citral for either concentration or for any of the exposure times. b Reduction was statistically significant (P 0.05) in comparison to the control (with no antimicrobials) at the same time exposure. the 4.0% concentration produced a significant reduction (P = 0.014 in comparison to the control) within 30 min or 6 h of exposure, but became significant after 24 h of exposure. the log10 reductions were statistically significant (P 0.05) in comparison to the control (with no antimicrobials) at the same time exposure. reductions were significantly different (P 0.05) between 2.0% and 4.0% allspice oil. the log10 genome copy numbers of MNV RNA recovered were determined by RT-qPCR after exposure to each antimicrobial (for 30 min, 6 h, or 24 h) followed by RNase I digestion. no reductions were observed in the controls (with no exposure to antimicrobials) after 24 h. values with statistical significance (P 0.05) for differences between the antimicrobial-treated samples are indicated with an asterisk. all of the reductions observed for the samples treated with allspice oil were highly significant (P 0.0001) in comparison to the no-antimicrobial controls. allspice oil

initially lower than the number of untreated viruses binding to cells in the control samples. the number of bound viruses increased with longer exposures to both antimicrobials, particularly for the lemongrass oil treatment. this is directly opposite the cell culture infectivity which decreased over time. untreated (no antimicrobials) MNV control (examples of MNV particles are indicated by arrows) untreated (no antimicrobials) MNV particles range from approximately 20 nm to 35 nm in diameter and have an icosahedral symmetry (appear spherical in most images) the size of the textured particles was too small and the particles were too numerous to be MNV. no reductions in MNV were observed in the neutralization tests with any of the plant antimicrobials in comparison to the DMEM-FBS or PBS controls. the reductions observed with 4.0% lemongrass oil were significantly greater than those with the 2.0% concentration following 6 and 24 h of exposure. both the lemongrass oil and the

both tubes (with and without RNase I digestion) were subjected to RT-qPCR to determine the degradation of the viral capsid. the log10 genome copy numbers of MNV RNA recovered were determined by RT-qPCR after exposure to each antimicrobial (for 30 min, 6 h, or 24 h) followed by RNase I digestion. values with statistical significance (P 0.05) for differences between the antimicrobial-treated samples are indicated with an asterisk. only 2.7 log10 remained bound to the cells at the end of the assay. the multiple wash steps may have removed much of the MNV (or possibly cells with bound MNV) from the wells. o-cell control 2 in Table 1 was able to bind to the cell culture plates. the RNA did not bind to the cells or the cell culture plate. the extracted RNA from the RAW 264.7 cells did not result in nonspecific amplification in the RT-qPCR assays. the TEM images for the untreated MNV, the MNV after exposure to 4.0% lemongrass oil and 4.0% citral for 24 h, and the MNV after exposure to 4.0% allspice oil for 30 min are shown in Fig. 3. the MNV following a 24-h exposure to allspice oil was included in the original TEM imaging, yet very few particles (one or two per entire grid) could be found. the MNV particles treated with citral were even larger, with an average size of 300 nm (range of 350 to 750 nm) no such large particles were observed in control grids which included only the antimicrobial in PBS and no virus particles. allspice oil, lemongrass oil, and citral have all been shown to have antimicrobial efficacy against Escherichia coli. allspice oil, lemongrass oil, and citral were examined for their antiviral efficacies against MNV. all three produced significant reductions within 6 h of exposure. reductions greater than 2 log10 were not observed until after 24 h. citral had greater antimicrobial efficacy than lemongrass oil. plant antimicrobials appear to act directly on enveloped viruses (e.g., HSV-1 and HSV-2), since they do not appear to prevent adsorption of the viruses to host cells (39, 46, 47, 52, 89). some studies have found that the plant antimicrobial inhibited viral uncoating by interfering with endosome-lysosome fusion. studies have attempted to elucidate the mechanisms of action of plant antimicrobials against nonenveloped viruses. eucalyptus essential oil was not effective against intracellular adenovirus and only minimally effective against intracellular mumps virus. TEM (67) was performed to determine the mechanism(s) of antiviral efficacy for the three plant antimicrobials tested. these included a cell culture infectivity assay, an RNase I protection experiment, and a host cell binding experiment. this suggests that there was at least some degradation of the viral capsid in the samples that had been exposed to allspice for shorter durations. after 30 min of exposure, there were fewer virus particles observed under TEM. by 24 h of exposure, the number of virus particles had been reduced further so that it was difficult to find recognizable virus particles. this is possibly indicative of the virus capsid being degraded, particularly with increasing duration of exposure to allspice oil. a slow buildup of the antimicrobial on the capsid surface could lead to greater reductions in cell culture infectivity. a slow buildup of the antimicrobial on the surface of the capsid over time could lead to greater reductions in cell culture infectivity. efficacy appears to be broad spectrum, as they also inactivated MNV. allspice oil appears to cause the viral capsid to lose its integrity, ultimately leading to exposure of the viral RNA. the allspice oil acts directly upon the viral RNA. surface and food sanitizers to control noV and enteric viruses. they do not immediately exhibit antiviral efficacy. they are generally recognized as safe (GRAS)"}
