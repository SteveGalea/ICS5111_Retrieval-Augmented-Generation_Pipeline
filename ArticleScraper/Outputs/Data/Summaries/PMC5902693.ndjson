{"summary": "no prior study has analyzed a CDC Twitter handle\u2019s entire contents. all followers (N=809) were manually categorized. all tweets (N=768) were manually coded for contents and whether photos or videos were attached. study confirms CDC health communicators' experience that original tweets created by @CDC_AMD twitter profile sharing images or videos received more retweets. current policy of attaching images to tweets should be encouraged. CDC uses Twitter as a tool for health research, including content analysis, surveillance, engagement, recruitment, intervention, and network analysis. OAMD noted the value of Twitter in march 2016 when a tweet regarding CDC\u2019s submission of genomic sequence data led to a global discussion on Elizabethkingia anophelis. in this case study, we analyzed the @CDC_AMD Twitter handle to divulge information regarding followers and popular tweet content. a protocol for analysis was created and approved for use by OAMD. manual coding first, we manually categorized @CDC_AMD\u2019s followers into 6 categories specified by OAMD. individual scientists, physicians, and other public health professionals Governmental organizations, such as other branches in CDC, and other federal agencies. for negative binomial regression models, we used glm.nb() in stats package. for hurdle models, we used hurdle() in pscl package. weet count data, we explored the use of negative binomial regression models (Models B and C) and the hurdle models (Models D and E) we constructed 2 negative binomial regression models. model F included both Media and Content variables as predictors; model G included Media only. manual coding first, we manually categorized @CDC_AMD\u2019s followers into 6 categories specified by OAMD. individual scientists, physicians, and other public health professionals Governmental organizations, such as other branches in CDC, and other federal agencies Nongovernmental organizations. udio 0.99.903 (RStudio, Inc., Boston, MA) used glm.nb() in stats package. for negative binomial regression models, we used hurdle() in pscl package. @CDC_AMD had 768 tweets, of which 88.8% (682/768) were original and 11.2% (86/768) were @CDC_AMD\u2019s retweets of other Twitter users\u2019 tweets. @CDC_AMD had 809 followers, and it followed 195 Twitter accounts. tweets by @CDC_AMD fell into the miscellaneous category. 8 in 10 tweets retweeted by @CDC_AMD fell into the miscellaneous category. @CDC_AMD retweeted a tweet about the Google Doodle on scientist Antoine van Leeuwenhoek. the most retweeted tweet in our dataset of 768 tweets was about the Google Doodle on scientist Antoine van Leeuwenhoek. Model B (negative binomial regression with \u201cContent\u201d as confounder) and Model C (negative binomial regression without \u201cContent\u201d) found no significant difference in their log-likelihood (210=17.9, P=.06). the simple model (Model C) had a lower AIC score and was therefore preferred. Model C (negative binomial model) and Model E (hurdle model) found that there was no significant difference in their log-likelihood (22=0.7, P=.70) a likelihood ratio test between Model C (negative binomial model) and Model E (hurdle model) found that there was no significant difference in their log-likelihood (22=0.7, P=.70) Webinar in content 1.329 (0.579-3.046).50 Bioinformatics in content 2.260 (0.965-5.296).36 Miscellaneous content 1.150 (0.743-1.782) an original tweet from @CDC_AMD sharing images or videos (or their links) had 37% more retweets. the miscellaneous category has 36% more retweets than tweets referred to the CDC AMD website. a likelihood ratio test between Model F and Model G found no significant difference between the two (25=8.2, P=.14) 88.8% (682/768) were original and 11.2% (86/768) were @CDC_AMD\u2019s retweets of other Twitter users\u2019 tweets. the majority (354/360, 98.3%) of the followers did not fall under prespecified categories. nearly 1 in 5 tweets referred to publications of CDC AMD scientists. all, except 2 (133/135, 98.5%), were original tweets. 8 in 10 tweets retweeted by @CDC_AMD fell into the miscellaneous category. tweets retweeted by @CDC_AMD covered various scientific topics. the most retweeted tweet in our dataset of 768 tweets was about the Google Doodle on scientist Antoine van Leeuwenhoek. a likelihood ratio test between Model B (negative binomial regression with \u201cContent\u201d as confounder) and Model C (negative binomial regression without \u201cContent\u201d) found that there was no significant difference in their log-likelihood. the simple model (Model C) had a lower AIC score and was therefore preferred. Model C (negative binomial model) and Model E (hurdle model) found no significant difference in log-likelihood. a likelihood ratio test between Model C (negative binomial model) and Model E (hurdle model) found that there was no significant difference in their log-likelihood (22=0.7, P=.70) Webinar in content 1.329 (0.579-3.046).50 Bioinformatics in content 2.260 (0.965-5.296).36 Miscellaneous content 1.150 (0.743-1.782) an original tweet from @CDC_AMD sharing images or videos (or their links) had 37% more retweets than an original tweet that did not share images or videos (or their links; Table 3). the miscellaneous category has 36% more retweets than tweets referred to the CDC AMD website. bAMD: advanced molecular detection. the number of retweets was similar across content topics posted by @CDC_AMD. study found 51.9% (354/682) of original tweets from @CDC_AMD directed users to the website of OAMD. it suggests that OAMD relied on their website to communicate scientific information in details, whereas they used Twitter to alert users to updates of their website contents. 19.5% (133/682) original @CDC_AMD tweets fell in that category. images can increase the effect of ads partly because they can convey meanings not expressed via words. soboleva et al [26] also highlighted that images can influence consumer persuasion, have the potential to effect attitude change, and increase recall of advertisements\u2019 verbal information. the effect of attaching visual cues to a tweet on its retweet frequency was found to vary across cycles of original tweets with hashtags #CDCGrandRounds and #VitalSigns. a retrospective observational study found that the effect of attaching visual cues to a tweet on its retweet frequency was 8.4 times that of a tweet with the title of the paper only (92 vs 11 retweets, P we select retweet frequency as our measure of engagement of a tweet. we acknowledge that other measures of impact exist, including \u201creach\u201d. retweeting is a high level of engagement, and retweeting is a high level of engagement. 55% of @CDC_AMD\u2019s followers did not belong to any of the prespecified categories in this study. this study confirms OAMD\u2019s experience that original tweets containing images or videos (or their links) created for the @CDC_AMD Twitter profile received more retweets. OAMD also promoted their scientists\u2019 research papers. 19.5% original @CDC_AMD tweets fell in that category. OAMD also promoted their scientists\u2019 research papers. tweets with a link to a photo or a video had more retweets than those without. tweets linking to a photo or a video had more retweets than tweets linking to a video. another study that analyzed tweets from 2009 to 2012 found links to photos increased the likelihood of a tweet being retweeted. a surgical journal found that the retweet frequency of its tweet was 8.4 times that of a tweet with the title of the paper only. this study adds evidence to a growing literature that attaching visual cues to tweets will increase their retweet frequency. it lacks the ability to classify 55% of the followers and 80% of contents retweeted by @CDC_AMD. ting is a high level of engagement, and retweet frequency provides solid evidence to our research questions. we did not distinguish videos from photos when we manually coded the visual cues. there were other potential confounders or effect modifiers that were not included in our study."}
