{"summary": "sperm protein IZUMO1 and its recently identified binding partner on the oolemma are among the first ligand-receptor pairs shown to be essential for gamete recognition and adhesion. however, the IZUMO1-IZUMO1R interaction does not appear to be directly responsible for promoting the fusion of the gamete membranes. this suggests that this critical phase of the fertilization cascade requires the concerted action of alternative fusogenic machinery. spermatozoa were counterstained with PNA (green) and DAPI (blue) after PLA labeling, spermatozoa were counterstained with PNA (green) and DAPI (blue) additional controls included the substitution of one of the primary antibodies for buffer alone (IZUMO1 only) comparison of body weight (g) and testis weight (g) were observed between WT and Glipr1l1-/- mice. this experiment was replicated in a minimum of 4-5 mice per genotype and the data are expressed as the mean S.D."}
