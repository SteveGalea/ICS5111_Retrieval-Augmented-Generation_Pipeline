{"summary": "positive-strand RNA viruses pathogenic to humans, animals, and plants alter internal cellular membranes to create the physical scaffold offering the most suitable platform for virus replication (1\u20134) alterations include intracellular modification of cellular organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by poliovirus (5), dengue virus (6), and Brome mosaic virus (TuMV) the outer membrane of spherules is physically connected to the cellular organelle through a narrow neck. the type member of the Bromoviridae family is a plant-infecting, multicomponent RNA virus with a single-stranded genome divided among three components. a recent study (7) involving the TEM analysis of Nicotiana benthamiana leaves infected with wild-type (wt) BMV or ectopically expressing either p wt BMV infection resulted in the accumulation of cytoplasmic ER-derived polymorphic vesicles arranged into patches. ectopic expression of CP modified the ER to induce the accumulation of large assemblies of vesicles in the cytoplasm (7). the primary goal of this study was to identify the CP form required for encapsidation competent versus incompetent. mutant CP 2-20 and F184A were derived from a binary plasmid (PZP) containing a BMV RNA 3 full-length cDNA clone using a PCR-mediated mutagenesis approach. resulting PCR products were digested with the restriction enzyme SpeI and subcloned into a 35S-B4.1 vector double digested with StuI and SpeI. three CP mutants were derived from cDNA clones of B3. each mutant sequence was amplified by a PCR using a forward primer. the presence of the subcloned region in the desired orientation was confirmed. leaves of N. benthamiana, C. quinoa, or N. clevelandii were infiltrated using either a single agrotransformant or a desired combination of agrotransformants. leaves were harvested at 4 days postinfiltration (dpi), fixed, and embedded in Spurr's resin as described previously (7, 10). agrotransformants were allowed to infiltrate either wt BMV or wt B4. virions were purified from the source at 4 dpi and from four sink (s) spots at 10 dpi. virions were then subjected to precipitation using anti-CP antibodies against BMV CP or CMV CP. coimmunoprecipitated virions were used to extract RNA followed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using primers designed to amplify either a 500-nucleotide (nt) fragment of CMV RNA 1 or full-length BMV RNA 1. each virion preparation was subjected to co-IP using the respective anti-CP antibody in conjunction with anti-rabbit IgG-agarose. two CP mutants, 2-20 and F184A, constructed in this study, were derived from a binary plasmid (PZP) containing a BMV RNA 3 full-length cDNA clone using a PCR-mediated mutagenesis approach. resulting PCR products were digested with the restriction enzyme SpeI and subcloned into a 35S-B4.1 vector double digested with StuI and SpeI. a ribozyme sequence (Rz), a 35S terminator (T) and a right border of T-DNA indicate noncoding regions. the open box and stippled boxes indicate the locations of the ORFs of BMV MP and CP. all plasmid constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium sp. strain GV3101 cells. leaves of N. benthamiana, C. quinoa, or N. clevelandii were infiltrated using either a single agrotransformant or a desired combination of agrotransformants. virions were purified from the source at 4 dpi and from four sink (s) spots (s1 to s4; dotted circles) at 10 dpi. virions were then subjected to precipitation using anti-CP antibodies. coimmunoprecipitated virions were used to extract RNA followed by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) using primers designed to amplify either a 500-nucleotide (nt) fragment of CMV RNA 1 or full-length BMV RNA 1. each virion preparation was subjected to co-IP using the respective anti-CP antibody in conjunction with anti-rabbit IgG-agarose. mutants with mutations at CP N terminus were assembly defective. mutants 2-20 and 184A were assembly defective. mutant 2-20 was characterized by lacking 19 N-proximal amino acids. mutants 10P, 13P, and 18P were assembly competent. leaves were infiltrated with agrotransformants to ectopically express CP mutant B4/10P, B4/13P, B4/18P, B4/2-20, or B4/F184A. plants infiltrated with either wt B4, previously shown to ectopically express encapsidation-competent CP (27), or a full complement of wt BMV. TEM analyses of uninfiltrated leaves showed intact cellular organelles, such as the ER, chloroplast, mitochondrion, and nucleus. leaves expressing either a full complement of BMV or wt CP showed typical membrane modifications, including an ER-derived cluster of polymorphic, globular vesicles organized into vesicle pockets. the procedures used to fix the leaf tissue and for staining thin sections are described in Materials and Methods. vesicles induced by wt and mutant BMV CP are due to replicase protein 1a. d wt and mutant CPs were expressed from replication-derived mRNA. expression of assembly-defective CP mutants via replication and their effect on vesicle induction. TEM images of negatively stained virions purified from leaves of N. benthamiana infiltrated with the indicated samples. vesicles induced by assembly-competent CP mutants 10P, 13P, and 18P were clearly associated with dilated ER. phenotypic appearance of vesicles induced in leaves coinfiltrated with B1, B2, and either B3/2-20 or B3/F184A is identical to that of vesicles induced by p1a and p2a (7). we opted to test the effect of CP mutants in another host susceptible to BMV, Chenopodium quinoa. wt BMV induced chlorotic local lesions followed by mottling symptoms on systemically wt CP is incompetent to induce ER modifications in nonhost plants. inability of CP to induce vesicles could be one of the consequences of the defensive phenotypes. only N. benthamiana is susceptible to BMV, but it remains symptomless. we opted to use N. clevelandii as a nonhost plant species for examining changes induced by BMV. the number of vesicles induced by wt CP in a given vesicle pocket was very low. cytopathology of leaves expressing either p2a or MP was indistinguishable from that of healthy samples. the finding most significant to the present study was the absence of vesicle induction by the wt CP in N. clevelandii. wt BMV was coexpressed with a genetically related virus, wt CMV. plants infected with both viruses possess a tripartite genome. cytopathology, trans-encapsidation, and cell-to-cell spread of wt BMV were investigated. representative TEM images showing membrane rearrangements induced in N. clevelandii by CMV (A), BMV (B), and CMV and BMV (C, D) m, mitochondrion; ER, endoplasmic reticulum, Sp, spherules; Ve, vesicles; V, virions; interplay between CP-mediated vesicle induction and virus assembly. analysis of leaves infiltrated with wt BMV revealed only the spot representing the source (Fig. 7B) and none of the four spots representing sinks (Fig. 7C) contained virions characteristic of BMV. virions were recovered from both source and sink regions. agrotransformants corresponding to wt genome complements of BMV and CMV were mixed and allowed to spot infiltrate (i.e., as the source) into N. benthamiana leaves. similar infiltrations performed in N. benthamiana leaves served as controls. initial Northern blot assays of virion RNA recovered from source areas revealed that the procedures used for the purification of BMV or CMV resulted in copurification of heterologous virions failure to detect BMV RNAs in the sink areas suggested that virions encapsidating BMV RNAs failed to move from the source to the sink. it is likely that encapsidation of BMV RNAs could have rendered the virions functionally defective. PCR products were subjected to co-IP with either anti-BMV CP antibody or anti-CMV CP antibody. the resulting PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. ethidium bromide staining followed by ethidium bromide staining. each mutant sequence was subcloned into the genetic background of either wt B3 (which translates CP from replication-derived mRNA when coexpressed with wt B1 and B2) or wt B4 (engineered to translate CP independently of replication; i.e., it has ectopic expression) (27). ectopic expression of assembly-defective CP results in no vesicle induction. the first lot was used to verify the expression of CP by Western blotting and virion assembly. the second lot was processed with Spurr's resin for visualizing membrane modifications by TEM (7). virions characteristic of BMV could be purified from leaves expressing wt B4, B4/13P, B4/14P, or B4/18P but not from leaves expressing mutants B4/2-20 and F184A. these modifications are not the artifacts of the chemical fixation used in this study. the physical appearance and structure of cellular organelles remained unaltered. these results suggest that CP-mediated vesicle induction requires an encapsidation-competent form of CP. c wt and mutant CPs were expressed from ectopically expressed mRNA. expression of assembly-defective CP mutants via replication and their effect on vesicle induction. each infiltrated leaf sample was divided into two lots. one lot was used to verify CP expression and virion assembly. the second lot was used for TEM analysis for examining changes induced by each CP mutant. phenotypic appearance of vesicles induced by ectopically expressed p1a and CP is identical to that of vesicles induced by p1a and p2a (7). phenotypic appearance of vesicles induced in leaves coinfiltrated with B1, B2, and either B3/2-20 or B3/F184A is identical to that of p1a and p2a (7). leaves of C. quinoa plants expressing either a full complement of wt BMV or wt CP from ectopically expressed B4 mRNA were subjected to TEM analysis. vesicle induction was never observed in leaves ectopically expressing assembly-defective mutants. wt CP is incompetent to induce ER modifications in nonhost plants. inability of CP-mediated vesicle induction could be one of the consequences of the defensive phenotypes associated with nonhosts. we opted to use N. clevelandii as a nonhost plant for examining the cytopathologic changes induced by BMV. plants infiltrated with wt BMV agrotransformants served as a control. at 4 dpi, leaves from healthy plants were processed for TEM analysis. results are in contrast to those previously observed in N. benthamiana (7) or C. quinoa. wt clevelandii leaves infiltrated with wt BMV (B, C), ectopically expressed p1a (D), p2a/MP (E) and CP (F) the results demonstrate that wt BMV CP is competent to induce vesicles in susceptible hosts such as N. benthamiana and C. quinoa but not in the nonhost. cytopathologic changes induced in N. clevelandii plants following agroinfiltration with either wt CMV or wt BMV. cytopathologic changes induced in plants infected with CMV showed induction of spherule-like invaginations associated with the tonoplast. cytoplasm was inundated with electron-dense material resembling viruses. agrotransformant wt BMV or B4 was allowed to infiltrate discrete spots (diameter, 10 mm) in leaves of N. clevelandii (referred to as the source in Fig. 7A and F) at 4 dpi, a discrete set of leaf discs encompassing either the source or four sink areas (positioned approximately 30 mm away from the source) was excised from N. clevelandii and N. bentham virions were not recovered from either the source (Fig. 7D) or sink (Fig. 7E) regions of control N. benthamiana leaves. however, as observed previously (27), virions were recovered from the source (Fig. 7I) but not the sink (Fig. 7J) region of control N. benthamiana leaves. virion RNA isolated from co-IP preparations was subjected to RT-PCR using primers specific for genomic RNA preparations of either BMV or CMV. homologous virions of BMV and CMV packaging their respective genomic RNAs were detected in the source and in the sink areas. failure to detect BMV RNAs in the sink areas suggested that CMV virions encapsidating BMV RNAs failed to move from the source to the sink. virions purified from leaves infiltrated with BMV or CMV were subjected to co-IP with either anti-CMV CP antibody (a) or anti-BMV CP antibody (b). virions purified from leaf discs about 15 mm in diameter excised from the source and sink areas were subjected to co-IP with either anti-CMV CP antibody (a) or anti-CMV CP antibody (b). the results show that only encapsidation-competent CP is able to induce vesicles in susceptible hosts N. benthamiana and C. quinoa. even encapsidation-competent wt CP is not able to modify ER to induce vesicles. ectopically expressed CP in N. benthamiana is incompetent to modify ER to induce vesicles. expression of replication-derived CP readily resulted in assembly into virions. this suggests that virion assembly is linked to replication and occurs independently of vesicle induction. a myriad of host proteins interacting with MP or CP have been implicated in this active process (40, 41) the results of this study provide previously unrecognized cytopathology-based evidence to explain the mechanism of cell-to-cell movement of BMV. this defective cell-to-cell spread of BMV in N. benthamiana could be attributed to the defective MP resulting in subliminal infection. virions encapsidating BMV RNA is incompatible with the host machinery. if CP-mediated vesicles function as transport vesicles, it is reasonable to assume that they are functionally similar to plant transport vesicles. a TEM analysis of cytopathologic changes induced in susceptible plant species supporting BMV replication revealed unexpected observations. bromoviruses revealed the presence of ER-derived membranous vesicles (53\u201356) since the vesicles seen in these studies did not resemble spherules, their existence in plant cells remains open. a more realistic way of elucidating the existence of spherules associated with the BMV infection cycle would be to perform a side-by-side comparison of the membrane modifications induced by BMV in yeast and plant"}
