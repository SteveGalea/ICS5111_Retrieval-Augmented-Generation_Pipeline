{"summary": "TJs are highly specialized membrane domains whose main function is to maintain adjacent cells close enough to avoid the free passage of small molecules, microorganisms, and cells across the paracellular space [1,2]. TJs are also involved in several signal transduction pathways [6,7], transmitting signals from the outside to the inside of the cell and vice versa to regulate several cellular processes. both proteins span the membrane a single time and have an extracellular domain formed by two Ig-like loops. these proteins also possess a short cytoplasmic tail represented by its C-terminal region. members of this family, like JAM-A and CAR, function as receptors for several viruses. claudins are tetraspaning proteins whose main function is to regulate the passage of ions across the paracellular space. the claudin family of proteins is the last transmembrane component of the TJs. occludin, tricellulin, and marvelD3 have three members. the roles of tricellullin and marvelD3 at the TJ are similar to that of occludin. transmembrane TJ proteins interact with cytoplasmic proteins via the PDZ binding domains (PSD/DlgA/ZO-1) in their cytoplasmic regions. cytoplasmic proteins like ZO-1, ZO-2, and ZO-3 also possess PDZ domains. the first TJ protein that was identified as a viral receptor was the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) there are two different viruses known to use CAR as a receptor, adenoviruses and coxsackie B viruses. the binding of adenovirus to the cell surface and its entry into the cell are two separate but highly coordinated events. coxsackieviruses are capable of causing diarrhea (serotypes 40 and 41), enter their host through the oral route, and have to cross the intestinal mucosa to initiate viremia. to do so, these viruses must gain access to the TJ where they can bind CAR and enter the cell. adenoviruses are not endocytosed bound to either CAR or DAF. the endocytosis of coxsackie B viruses is coupled with the internalization of another TJ protein, occludin. occludin enters the cell via macropinocytosis, while the viral particles enter the cell through caveolin-mediated endocytosis. the use of drugs that impair the macropinocytosis of occludin also impairs virus internalization. mutations in the first extracellular loop that prevent claudin-1 from establishing cell\u2013cell contacts also impair HCV entry. occludin, occludin, and occludin were all shown to be important for virus internalization. occludin, occludin, and occludin were all shown to be important for virus internalization. TJs are considered a primary barrier for pathogens due to the fact that they closely seal epithelial cells together so that neither bacteria nor viruses can access the deeper cell layers that lie beneath epithelia. the organization of TJs and the proteins that constitute them is specific for each type of epithelium. this might give viruses that use TJ proteins as receptors some sort of tissue specificity. west Nile virus is capable of doing so by promoting the degradation of multiple TJ proteins, like JAM-A, ZO-1, occludin, and claudin-1. alterations in the actin cytoskeleton, adherens junctions, and a decrease in the expression levels of ZO-1, which alters the integrity of TJs, occur in endothelial cells. papillomaviruses (HPV) can bind 4 TJ proteins, MUPP1, MAGI-1, PATJ, and ZO-2. the presence of E4-ORF causes the disruption of TJs without causing a disruption of adherens junction. a possible association between loss of cell polarity and carcinogenesis induced by HPV has been suggested. there are just a few examples of viruses that open the TJ during late steps of their replication cycle. the binding of adenovirus particles to their receptor CAR causes a disruption of the TJs. this disruption is exploited by adenoviruses during the late stages of viral replication. hepatitis C virus CLDN-1, CLDN-6, CLDN-9 Viral entry [48,49] Occludin Viral entry [50] Dengue virus CLDN-1 Viral entry [51] ZO-1 Alteration of tight junction integrity [61] west Nile virus JAM-A, ZO-1, Occludin, CLDN-1 Impair tight junctions for hematogenous dissemination [54,55,56,57,58,59] RNA viruses Reovirus J"}
