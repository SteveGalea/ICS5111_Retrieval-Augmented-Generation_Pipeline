{"summary": "a USDA survey of pre-weaned dairy heifers reported that 24% experienced diarrhea and 18% received antimicrobial treatment for it [1, 2]. zinc supplementation in children decreases the incidence, duration, and severity of diarrhea, increases recovery rates, decreases the use of antibiotics and antidiarrheal medications, and reduces mortality [5\u201310]. pre-weaned dairy calves randomly assigned to receive either organic zinc methionine (ZM), inorganic zinc sulfate (ZS) or a placebo in milk once daily for 14 days. calf morbidity, mortality, and antimicrobial usage may be mitigated. a sample size of 500 calves per treatment group (n = 1500 total) was deemed required. each calf received 4 liters of colostrum within 1 hour of birth. each calf received a second colostrum feeding (2 liters) 6\u201310 hours after birth. calves with clinical diarrhea received 1.9 liters of a commercial oral electrolyte solution once daily between milk feedings. all pre-weaned calves had free choice access to water and a calf starter grain mix. each calf received 1 mL of a selenium supplement intramuscularly within 24 hours of age. zinc treatment Prior to the trial, total daily dietary zinc consumed by calves during the first 14 days of life was estimated using heavy metal analysis of water (n = 2), calf milk (n = 2), two types of oral electrolyte solutions (n = 2), calf starter grain (n = 2), and an estimated intake of starter grain by calves less than 14 days of age. ate monohydrate (equivalent to 80 mg elemental zinc) combined with 0.44 g milk replacer powder. the milk replacer powder was the same product used in the pre-weaned calf milk ration. a calf with an attitude score of 1 was bright, alert, and readily stood with stimulation; a calf with a score of 2 was quiet, alert, and readily stood with stimulation; a calf with a score of 2 was quiet, alert, and readily stood with stimulation. if no fresh feces were observed in the hutch, \u201cnone seen\u201d (NS) was recorded. 127 randomly-sampled calves were cared for at the dairy in accordance with standard commercial operations. a random sample of 127 calves was selected for additional biologic sampling. 8 to 10% of the study population was selected due to the financial constraints of additional laboratory testing. 36 of the 127 randomly-sampled calves were randomly selected for analysis due to limited financial resources. fecal samples were collected at two time points, the first day of diarrhea (fecal score > 1) and the day diarrhea resolved (second day of fecal score = 1). 7 days of age were not tested for E. coli K99 based on calves\u2019 susceptibility [28]. tests were performed according to kit manufacturer guidelines. a low-temperature incubator was used during incubation periods. a Chi-Square test of Independence was used to compare proportions of calves by sex and mortality between treatment groups and between bulls and heifers. the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis Rank Sum test was used when assumptions were violated. variables identified as confounders were included in the final model. logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between microbiological cure and treatment group. other predictor variables of interest included sex, serum total protein, and age. treatment or hutch exit and number of days with diarrhea were dropped from all final models in favor of improved Akaike information criterion. diarrhea cure was defined as a fecal score greater than 1 and diarrhea cure was defined as the second consecutive day of normal feces (fecal score of 1) following the first diarrhea episode. study design and population A double-blind, block randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted between December 14, 2015 and June 15, 2016 on a large dairy in California\u2019s San Joaquin Valley. the dairy was composed of 5,500 lactating cows, predominantly Holsteins, and housed approximately 1,600 pre-weaned calves. a sample size of 213 diarrheic calves per group ( = 0.05, = 0.10, power 90%) would be needed to show each calf received 4 liters of colostrum within 1 hour of birth and a second colostrum feeding (2 liters) 6\u201310 hours after birth. pre-weaned calves were transported to individual metal hutches initially bedded with almond shells. calves were gradually weaned over a 10-day period, starting at approximately 60 days of age. each calf received 1 mL of a selenium supplement (MU-SE; Merck Animal Health, Boxmeer, Netherlands) intramuscularly within 24 hours of age and an intranasal vaccine. Approximately 8.3% (n = 126) of all enrolled calves were also vaccinated using an autogenous moraxella bovis/bovoculi the first 14 days of life was estimated using heavy metal analysis of water (n = 2), calf milk (n = 2), two types of oral electrolyte solutions (n = 2), and an estimated intake of starter grain by calves less than 14 days of age. analysis was performed at the California Animal Health and Food Safety System\u2019s (CAHFS) toxicology laboratory (Davis, CA) by ICP-MS (inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry) calf milk bottles and hutches were marked with either pink, orange, or yellow ink. at enrollment, calf characteristics, including sex, birth date, time of first colostrum feeding, and treatment color were recorded. attitude and feces were assessed daily until 28 days post-enrollment. a calf was euthanized if morbidity was severe enough to depress appetite, hydration status, attitude, mentation, and/or ambulatory capability. a calf was euthanized if morbidity was severe enough to significantly depress appetite, hydration status, attitude, mentation, and/or ambulatory capability. blood from each calf was collected from the jugular vein using a 20 gauge needle. blood from each calf was placed into a 10 mL red top serum tube. samples remained at room temperature for up to 12 hours until clotting. fecal samples were collected at two time points, the first day of diarrhea (fecal score > 1) and the day diarrhea resolved (second day of fecal score = 1). fecal samples were tested using a commercial kit (Pathasure Enteritis 4; Biovet, Quebec, Canada) both fecal samples were tested for all four pathogens. milk zinc For each of the 107 study days of zinc supplementation, approximately 1.5 mL of treated milk from two bottles of each treatment group were randomly collected into 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes. at the time of analysis, milk samples were thawed at 4\u00b0C, vortexed, pooled by week and treatment group, and analyzed for zinc concentration (ppm) 36 of the 127 randomly-sampled calves were randomly selected for analysis due to limited financial resources. fecal samples were collected at two time points, the first day of diarrhea (fecal score > 1) and the day diarrhea resolved (second day of fecal score = 1). samples from calves older than 7 days of age were not tested for E. coli K99 based on calves\u2019 susceptibility [28]. tests were performed according to kit manufacturer guidelines and a low-temperature incubator (Fisher Scientific, Model 146, Pittsburgh, PA) was used during incubation periods. an ANOVA was used to compare oral zinc dose (mg/kg) at start and end as well as mean body weight (kg) at birth, end of treatment, and hutch exit between treatment groups. a Chi-Square test of Independence was used to compare proportions of calves by sex as well as mortality between treatment groups. variables identified as confounders were included in the final model. logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between microbiological cure and treatment group. logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between microbiological cure and treatment group. the final linear regression model for ADG during the pre-weaning period was stratified by sex. age at the end of treatment or hutch exit and number of days with diarrhea were dropped from all final models in favor of improved Akaike information criterion (AIC) logistic regression was used to evaluate associations between microbiological cure and treatment group. other predictor variables of interest included sex, serum total protein, and age on the first day of diarrhea. onset of diarrhea and clinical cure was defined as a fecal score greater than 1. diarrhea cure was defined as the second consecutive day of normal feces (fecal score of 1) following the first diarrhea episode. subsequent episodes of diarrhea were not included in the analysis. a total of 1,513 calves were enrolled in the trial. however, 23 calves were excluded shortly after enrollment. a total of 242 calves (16.3%) had minimal fecal output at the time of enrollment. birth weight data were available for all 1,482 calves. due to calf mortality between enrollment and completion of treatment. hutch exit weight data were available for 1,421 calves. n = 491) n Mean SE 95% CI n Mean SE 95% CI n Mean SE 95% CI Lower Upper Lower Upper Lower Upper Birth WT3 500 40.95 0.255 40.45 41.45 491 40.54 0.256 40.04 41.05 491 41.15 0.267 40.63 41.67 Serum TP4 500 6.35 0.028 6.30 6.41 491 6.33 0.028 6.27 6.38 491 6.37 0.026 6.32 baseline comparisons of fecal score excluded calves whose feces was \u201cnot seen\u201d at enrollment: placebo (n = 86), zinc methionine (n = 76), zinc sulfate (n = 80) table 2.
