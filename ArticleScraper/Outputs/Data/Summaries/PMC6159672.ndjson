{"summary": "all experimental procedures were performed in accordance with international guidelines regarding the care and use of laboratory animals. albino Wistar rats (Rattus norvegicus; weight, 150 to 160 g) and albino Swiss mice (weight, 23 to 25 g) were maintained under a 12:12-h light:dark cycle at 22 to 25 \u00b0C in a well-ventilated animal facility. 60 rats (30 male and 30 female) and 60 mice (30 male and 30 female) were assigned randomly into 6 groups (10 rats or mice per group) three types of bedding\u2014rice straw, wheat straw, and pine wood shavings\u2014were sterilized at 130 \u00b0C for 20 min, applied to a depth of 2 cm in cages. NOVA with Duncan posthoc testing (version 15.0, SPSS for Windows) was used to compare group means. significance defined as a P value less than 0.05. results In rats, serum AST, albumin, urea, and uric acid levels did not differ among types of bedding. serum albumin, urea, and uric acid levels did not differ among types of bedding. however, serum AST and ALT activities were significantly higher (P 0.05) mice housed on rice straw compared with the wood-shavings group. renal and hepatic concentrations of malondialdehyde were increased (P 0.05) in rats on wood shavings and decreased (P 0.05) in those on rice straw compared with wheat straw. catalase activity in liver and kidney was increased (P 0.05) in rats exposed to rice straw. male and female mice and rats housed on rice straw, wheat straw, and wood shavings as bedding materials. in contrast, the renal and hepatic catalase activities were higher (P 0.05) in mice housed on wheat straw but lower (P 0.05) in the wood-shavings groups. animals have been shown to prefer bedding with a large particle size, such as rice straw. beddings serve to absorb moisture from excrements and provide nesting material. bedding components may interact with experimental treatments. mice on rice straw consumed more feed than those given wood shavings. oxidative stress is defined as an imbalance between prooxidants and antioxidants."}
