{"summary": "bats were sampled between 2002 and 2011 in Panama, Brazil, Gabon, Gabon, Ghana, Germany, Papua New Guinea, and Australia. the sensitivities of these PCR assays at 95% probability of detection were 41.3 (95% confidence interval = 29.7\u201375.9) and 64.7 (95% confidence interval = 47.3\u2013112.9) international units/mL blood. bat viruses formed three different lineages on preliminary phylogenetic inspection. hepadnaviruses from cf. ruber were collectively termed roundleaf bat HBV (RBHBV), the virus from R. alcyone was designated horseshoe bat HBV (HBHBV), and viruses from u. bilobatum were collectively termed tent-making bat HBV (TBHBV). s was similar to ORFs of the known members of the orthohepadnavirus genus. but clearly distinct from ORFs of duck hepatitis B virus. hepadnaviruses clustered within two highly supported monophyletic clades. new world bat viruses formed a sister clade to all primate hepadnavirus. a basal in-group bifurcation separated the rodent viruses from all bat and primate viruses. the recently described miniopterus bat hepadnavirus from Myanmar (17) clustered as a sister clade to the African bat viruses. the blood of all five U. bilobatum yields concentrations comparable with or higher than concentrations observed in Old World bats. hepadnavirus-positive hipposiderid bat GB09-301 liver yielded clear staining patterns suggestive of deposits of viral DNA within the nuclei and cytoplasm of hepatocytes in an RBHBV-positive animal. in virus-infected bats, hepatoma cells were transfected with reconstructed genome plasmids. hepatoma cells were stained with all available bat sera from the hepadnavirus DNA-positive species. antibody detection rates were high, with 18.4% in hipposiderid bats (9 of 49 animals) and 6.3% in rhinolophid bats (1 of 16 animals) the existence of anti-S antibodies was evaluated using cells transfected with plasmids. of 10 IFA-reactive bat sera, only 1 hipposiderid serum showed detectable anti-S antibodies. this serum also reacted weakly with the LHBs proteins of the heterologous rhinolophid bat virus. bat hepadnaviruses replicate through reverse transcription (RT) step. reverse transcriptase activity of all bat hepadnaviral constructs was inhibited. RT of HBV requires interaction of viral polymerase and encapsidated pregenomic mRNA. myr-preS1 peptides derived from old world bat hepadnaviruses showed decreased inhibitory potential in PHH. myr-preS1 peptides from both HBHBV and TBHBV showed decreased inhibitory potential in PHH. pseudotyped with surface proteins of TBHBV (HDVTBHBV) was able to infect both PTH and PHH. specificity of infection was shown by the addition of infection-interfering myr-preS1 peptide inhibitors. the human sodium taurocholate cotransporting polypeptide (hNTCP) is a high-affinity receptor for HBV and HDV. in both pseudotypes, the infection could be inhibited by specific myr-preS1 peptides. the surface proteins of TBHBV supported infection of PTH and PHH. specimens (7.9%) and 1 of 16 Rhinolophus alcyone specimens (6.3%) from Gabon contained HBV-like sequences. Fig. 1 shows the distribution areas of these bat species in gray. all bat viruses varied in their nucleotide sequences by at least 35% from sequences of any known hepadnavirus. position of all ORFs in bat hepadnaviruses was similar to ORFs of the known members of the orthohepadnavirus genus. a Bayesian phylogenetic analysis based on full ortho- and avihepadnavirus genomes, bat hepadnaviruses clustered within two highly supported monophyletic clades. the new world bat viruses formed a sister clade to all primate hepadnaviruses. in all five bats from which solid organs were available, viral DNA in tissues was quantified by real-time PCR. the highest virus concentration of 2.2 1012 copies/g was observed in liver tissue. for new world bats, no organ specimens were available. available tissue samples showed few to moderate lymphocyte infiltrates and scant neutrophils/eosinophils in portal triads of hepadnavirus DNA-positive bats. in situ hybridization using an RNA probe directed against the full genome of RBHBV yielded clear staining patterns suggestive of deposits of viral DNA within the nuclei and cytoplasm of hepatocytes in an RBHBV DNA-positive animal. two bats showed concomitant viral DNA and antibodies against the homologous RBHBV. seven bats showed antibodies only, and two bats showed viral DNA only. the existence of anti-S antibodies was evaluated using cells transfected with plasmids. ab HB1 reacting with a linear epitope of the antigenic determinant of the HBV surface proteins was used. a substitution was not necessary caused by the naturally occurring binding motif. the authentic S protein of TBHBV and modified S proteins of RBHBV and HBHBV were secreted and detected by Western blotting in both the glycosylated and nonglycosylated forms. unique bat hepadnaviruses showed high sequence identity within a short amino acid stretch (NPLGFFPDH) that is highly conserved within primate HBV, including WMHBV, but not rodent viruses, such as woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) synthetic myristoylated (myr) preS1 peptides derived from the three bat hepadnaviruses were tested for their potential to inhibit HBV infection of susceptible primary human hepatocyte newly synthesized and secreted HBsAg in supernatants of HBV-infected cultures 11\u201315 d postinfection of PHHs. hepatitis- virus particles pseudotyped with surface proteins of all three bat hepadnaviruses were generated. but only HDV pseudotyped with surface proteins of TBHBV (HDVTBHBV) was able to infect both PTH and PHH. two different human sera effectively neutralized infection of PTH with HDVHBV but not HDVTBHBV. addition of an mAb (HB1) directed against the antigenic loop of the S domain of HBV and TBHBV lowered infectivity in both cases. the extent of perinatal transmission could affect the extent of chronic virus carriage in bats. high DNA detection rates speak in favor of prolonged courses of infection. lack of detectable anti-LHBs antibodies in all but one bat resembles human disease. there is complete absence of detection in cercopithecoid monkeys. host cosegregation in primates suggests a direct acquisition of HBV as a split-off from the stem lineage leading up to WMHBV by primates. it should be noted that WMHBV has never been redetected in wild or captive animals, and its actual host could have been an Old or New World mammal. hepadnaviruses have been identified as hepadnaviruses. hepadnaviruses have been identified as hepadnaviruses. hepadnaviruses have been identified as hepadnaviruses. recombinant hepadnaviruses are widely accepted as surrogates. recombinant HDV/hepadnaviruses are widely accepted as surrogates. recombinant hepadnaviruses are widely accepted as surrogates. the lack of neutralization of this virus matches the observation of occasional failure of the standard vaccine. a revised vaccine formulation, including full LHBs or at least the critical preS1 domain, could become necessary to that end. it is unclear whether bat hepadnaviruses impose an ongoing risk of zoonotic human infections. overlength constructs (1.1), surface expression vectors, and HDV pseudoparticles were generated as described previously. PHH and PTH infection, HBsAg detection, and infection of cells expressing the hNTCP were done as described before (41) and in SI Materials and Methods."}
