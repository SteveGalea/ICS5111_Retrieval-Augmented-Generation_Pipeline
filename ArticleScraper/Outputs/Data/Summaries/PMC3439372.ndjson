{"summary": "the aim of the present study was to examine the epidemiology of influenza-like illness (ILI) in two hospitals in maracay, Venezuela. a respiratory specimen and clinical information were obtained from each participant. adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, and respiratory sincytial virus were the most commonly detected pathogens. ARI remains a leading cause of global burden of disease, with an annual global incidence exceeding 400 million. ARI is the second most common cause of illness worldwide, with an annual global incidence exceeding 400 million [1]\u2013[3]. studies on the epidemiology of influenza viruses in developed countries have been published [13]\u2013[16]. a prospective study of adults with ILI in Brazil revealed that while influenza viruses were the predominant cause of ILI, rhinoviruses and other respiratory viruses were detected in 19.6% and 13.7% of subjects. ARI is the primary cause of weekly notifiable diseases registered by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (NESS) in Venezuela, ARI is the primary cause of weekly notifiable diseases registered by the National Epidemiological Surveillance System (NESS) [17]\u2013[21]. the epidemiology, clinical characteristics, and viral causes of ILI have been poorly characterized in Venezuela. a large proportion (37.8%) of the subjects at HCM belonged to the 15\u201329 age group. nearly half of the patients (42.3%) seen at IVSS-JMCT were younger than 5 years old. no hospitalized cases with ILI were recruited in this study. at least one viral organism was detected by viral isolation and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in 143 (15.6%) subjects. 78 (8.5%) were positive for influenza A viruses and 19 (2.1%) for influenza B viruses by viral isolation. 59 60 Total Viral Pathogen No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) Adenovirus 9*(5.6) 3 (1.2) 0 2 (1.3) 1 (2.3) 0 15 (1.6) Influenza virus A: H3 9 (5.6) 8 (3.2) 7 (2.3) 8 (5.1) 0 1 (14.3) 33 (3.6) H1 3 the most commonly detected viral pathogens in the 0\u20134 year old group were influenza A (11.1%) and adenoviruses (5.6%). influenza A was the most commonly detected viruses in the school-age group (5\u201314 year old: 6.8% and 4.0%, respectively) the circulating seasonal A/H1N1 strains in Venezuela (Figure 1A) were similar to those previously reported in central and south America [15], [16]. the pH1N1 samples were part of only one cluster similar to previously reported strains in Latin America [23]. influenza A virus was not detected during every month of every year. peak ILI activity was observed in 2008, with detection only during the months of January, March, and September. peak ILI activity was observed in 2008, with detection only during the months of January, March, and September. seasonal influenza A viruses remained in circulation throughout the pandemic period including 27% of all the influenza A viruses detected in October 2009. in 2010, 20% of influenza specimens obtained via oropharyngeal swabs were randomly selected and tested for the pandemic strain via RT-PCR. however, seasonal influenza A/H3N2 continued to be detected by our surveillance system. 96.9) 131 (91.6) 46 (92.0) 18 (94.7) 20 (95.2) 40 (87.0) Malaise 864 (94.3) 730 (94.4) 134 (93.7) 45 (90.0) 18 (94.7) 21 (100.0) 43 (93.5) Rhinorrhea 861 (94.0) 729 (94.3) 132 (92.3) 48 (96.0) 16 (84.2) 17 (81.0) 42 (91.3) Sore throat 178 (19.4) 135 (17.5) 43 (30.1)* Statistically significant differences (p0.05) between patients with ILI in whom virus was detected vs. virus was not detected. ages ranged from 1 month to 86 years with a mean age of 19.2 years (S.D. = 14.3 years) and a median of 17 years. a large proportion (37.8%) of the subjects at HCM belonged to the 15\u201329 age group. nearly half of the patients (42.3%) seen at IVSS-JMCT were younger than 5 years old. no hospitalized cases with ILI were recruited in this study. at least one viral organism was detected by viral isolation and/or reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) only one participant with a co-infection was observed. 78 (8.5%) were positive for influenza A viruses and 19 (2.1%) for influenza B viruses by viral isolation. age group (in years) 0\u20134 5\u201314 15\u201329 30\u201344 45\u201359 60 Total Viral Pathogen No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) No. (%) Adenovirus 9*(5.6) 3 (1.2) 0 2 (1.3) 1 (2.3) 0 influenza A and B were the most commonly detected viruses in the school-age group (5\u201314 year old: 6.8% and 4.0%, respectively) of the 78 influenza A cases, H3 subtype was detected in 33, and was observed in all the age groups. circulating seasonal A/H1N1 strains in Venezuela were similar to those previously reported in central and south America [15], [16]. the pH1N1 samples were part of only one cluster similar to previously reported strains in Latin America [23]. the pattern of influenza A occurrence was variable from year to year. influenza A virus was not detected during every month of every year. peak ILI activity was observed in 2008, with detection only during the months of January, March, and September. seasonal influenza A viruses remained in circulation throughout the pandemic period including 27% of all the influenza A viruses detected in October 2009. in 2010, 20% of influenza specimens obtained via oropharyngeal swabs were randomly selected and tested for the pandemic strain.

Respiratory Virus Screening and Identification Kit (D3 DFA Respiratory Virus Diagnostic Hybrids; Athens, OH) was used for the identification of adenoviruses, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses (types 1, 2, and 3), and RSV. for detection of hMPV antigens, we used vero E6 and LLC-MK2 cell lines. of the 254 specimens, 48 (18.9%) were randomly selected from repository samples collected before the 2009 pandemic. at the onset of the 2009 pandemic, 150 of 254 (59.1%) respiratory samples were tested for pH1N1 by Real Time RT-PCR. after peak of the second wave of the pandemic, the percentage of respiratory samples tested by Real Time RT-PCR was reduced to 22% (56 of 254) five l of the extracted RNA was added to 20 l of master mix. cycling conditions included a reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes and a denaturation step at 94\u00b0C for 2 minutes. phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. bootstrap analysis to determine the best-fitting tree for the gene. study population included every outpatient with ILI, regardless of age. at each site, trained medical personnel were responsible for properly identifying and classifying patients with ILI. a person defined as having ILI if he or she had a sudden onset of fever (38\u00b0C) and either cough or sore throat for less than five days in duration. swabs were placed in viral transport media and stored at \u201370\u00b0C until they were delivered on dry ice to NAMRU-6 in Lima, Per. swabs were processed at the Laboratorio Regional de Diagnostico e Investigacion del Dengue y otras Enfermedades Virales/Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas de la Universidad de Carabobo. adenoviruses, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses and enteroviruses were identified using direct fluorescence assays. a subset of 254 specimens (222 nasals and 32 oropharyngeals) were analyzed by one-step RT-PCR and/or real time RT-PCR. one-step RT-PCR and/or real time RT-PCR were not used to identify non-influenza viruses because the specific primers and protocols were available only for sub-typing influenza viruses. only virus isolation was used to detect and identify non-influenza viruses. primers were used to amplify the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A and influenza B viruses using the SuperScript III One-Step RT-PCR system kit (Invitrogen; San Diego, CA) primers described before were purified using Centri-Sep Columns (Princeton Separation; Englishtown, NJ) and sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems; Foster City, CA) Phylogenetic trees were constructed by neighbor-joining method and bootstrap analysis to determine the best-fitting tree for the gene using MEGA software. adenoviruses, influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza viruses and enteroviruses were identified using direct fluorescence assays. cells were spotted onto microscope slides. a subset of 254 specimens (222 nasals and 32 oropharyngeals) was analyzed by one-step RT-PCR and/or real time RT-PCR in order to sub-type influenza A/H1N1 (including pH1N1), influenza A/H3N2, and influenza B viruses. only virus isolation was used to detect and identify non-influenza viruses. RNA extraction and one-step RT-PCR Viral RNA extraction was performed from the supernatant of infected MDCK cells using a QIAamp Viral RNA kit. the one-step RT-PCR was performed following a procedure described previously [13] with primers that amplified the hemagglutinin (HA) gene of influenza A and influenza B viruses. phylogenetic analysis For confirmation of serotype and genotype of the circulating influenza viruses, 27 samples were sequenced. only the HA gene region of influenza viruses was analyzed routinely for genotyping."}
