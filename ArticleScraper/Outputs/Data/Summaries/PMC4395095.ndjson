{"summary": "Talaromyces marneffei is an opportunistic human fungal pathogen endemic to Southeast Asia and Southern China. most cases of T. marneffei infection occur in immune-deficient hosts, especially those infected with human immunodeficiency virus. infections have also been reported in non-HIV children with the underlying immune defects. melanins act as non-specific shields against various stressors. eumelanins, allomelanins, and pheomelanins are the most common melanins in fungi. laccases catalyze the oxidation of a wide variety of organic (especially aromatic) and inorganic compounds. lac1 encodes a laccase that when deleted leads to mutants being unable to synthesize the brown colored DOPA-melanin. this pigmentation is attributed to DHN-melanin synthesis and requires the activity of a laccase to polymerize 1,8-DHN to form the DHN-melanin polymer [6, 15]. the pbrB gene encodes a laccase that shares a common evolutionary origin with fungal laccases functioning in DHN-melanin synthesis. the genome of the T. marneffei type strain harbors 10 genes that encode multicopper oxidase proteins. neffei G681 strain was maintained on malt extract (ME) agar. conidial suspensions of transformants and the G526 strain were harvested from conidiating colonies growing on ANM solid medium at 28\u00b0C for 1 week. pbrB plasmid was digested with BglII and StuI to remove the pbrB coding region. the plasmid was ligated to a BamHI/EcoRV fragment containing the pyrG blaster selectable marker cassette to generate pplilac25. plac25 was amplified by inverse PCR using iLL25EC1/iUL25EC1 primers. egfp coding region was inserted at the 5\u2019 end of pbrB, 87 bases after start codon. pbrB::pbrB::GFP strain was excised by NotI digestion. pbrB pbrB + complementation strain was transformed with p25N9 and PyrG+ transformants were selected. genetically modified T. marneffei transformants were examined by PCR and/or Southern blot analysis. Conidia from the pbrB::pbrB::GFP strain were inoculated into two flasks containing 50 ml of BHI broth. each flask was incubated in a shaking incubator at 28\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 3 days. slides were incubated with 10 g/ml of anti-melanin IgM antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 hours. negative control samples were produced by omitting the binding step. calcofluor white staining was performed as previously described. all pyrG+ transformants and the T. marneffei G681 strain used as a control were maintained on malt extract (ME) agar. rRNA was amplified using specific primers PmLac25-F and L25Re. the 18s rRNA was amplified as a control using Pm1 and Pm2 primers. pbrB plasmid was digested with BglII and StuI to remove the pbrB coding region. the pbrB plasmid was digested to a BamHI/EcoRV fragment containing the pyr. plac25 was amplified by inverse PCR using iLL25EC1/iUL25EC1 primers. egfp coding region was inserted at the 5\u2019 end of pbrB, 87 bases after start codon. pbrB::pyrG + strain was inoculated onto ANM agar containing 1 mg/ml 5-fluoroorotic acid to select for loss of the pyrG cassette via homologous recombination. pbrB pyrG - strain was transformed with p25N9 and PyrG+ transformants were selected. genetically modified T. marneffei transformants were examined by PCR and/or Southern blot analysis Conidia from the pbrB(p)::pbrB::GFP strain were inoculated into two flasks containing 50 ml of BHI broth. each flask was incubated in a shaking incubator at 28\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 3 days. mycelia from the 28\u00b0C culture were poured onto Miracloth and rinsed with cold PBS. slides were incubated with 10 g/ml of anti-melanin IgM antibody. slides were washed with PBS and then incubated with a dilution 1:100 of goat anti-mouse IgM antibody. negative control samples were produced by omitting the anti-melanin IgM binding step. the synthesis of DHN-melanin contributes to the green coloration of conidia during asexual development. at 28\u00b0C, the T. marneffei F4 colonies appear green as a result of the pigmented conidia. query sequence in blast searches of the T. marneffei ATCC 18224 genome sequence (GenBank, NCBI) this identified two highly homologous genes (Cnlac1 homology of 88% and 78%, respectively) this identified 10 genes encoding putative multicopper oxidases. laccases contain four copper atoms including type1 Cu, type 2 Cu, and pair of type 3 Cu. each clade was highlighted and named according to sequences with known functions and fungal divisions. the ascomycete laccase lineage can be divided into 2 clades supported with very high bootstrap values (99% and 100%) pbrB is expressed during asexual development and localizes to all cell types of the conidiophore. RNA samples were extracted from T. marneffei F4 grown in BHI broth at 28\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C for 3 days. a transcript was not detected under these conditions suggesting there is little or no pbrB expression in vegetative hyphal or yeast cells. epifluorescence microscopy of the T. marneffei strain expressing the PbrB::GFP fusion in vegetative cells grown at 37\u00b0C (A) or 28\u00b0C (B) for 3 days. no GFP fluorescence was noted in either cell type. melanin staining was highly co-localised with the fluorescence form the PbrB::GFP fusion protein. this supports the hypothesis that PbrB is likely to be involved in melanin biosynthesis during conidiation. pbrB conidia were grown on ANM plates at 28\u00b0C after 14 days. the wild type control exhibits green colored conidiation at 28\u00b0C after 14 days. the pbrB mutant complemented the conidiation phenotype. microscopic images were captured at 200X (A, B) and 400X (C, D) magnification. to assess if deletion of pbrB and the consequent change in pigmentation of the conidia affected germination, 106conidia of the pbrB and pbrB pbrB + strains were inoculated in BHI broth. there was no difference in the germination of the pbrB and pbrB the line plots the growth rates of pbrB (solid line) and pbrB pbrB + strains growing at 28\u00b0C on ANM medium. errors present standard error of the mean (SEM) susceptibility to antifungal activity of macrophage was examined. however, no differences in stress susceptibility were observed. pbrB cells growing in BHI medium at 37\u00b0C for 5 days showed equivalent staining as the wild type using the anti-melanin antibody. polyketide synthase (PKS), tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase (4HNR), trihydroxynaphthalene reductase (3HNR), dehydratase (D) and laccase. intermediate metabolites including 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene (1,3,6,8-THN), scytalone, 1,3,8-trihydroxynaphthalene (1,3,8-THN), laccases contain four copper atoms including type1 Cu, type 2 Cu, and a pair of type 3 Cu. the patterns of conserved amino acids coordinated with each type of copper are HXHG, HXH, HCHXXXHXXM/F/L, and HXXHXH, which occupy the L1\u2013L4 signature sequences starting from the N-terminus. Phylogenetic relationships of the 55 MCOs were inferred using the Neighbor-Joining method and bootstrap tested (1000 replicates) the alignment was then used to construct a relatedness tree using the MEGA 6 software. RNA samples were extracted from T. marneffei F4 grown in BHI broth at 28\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C for 3 days. a transcript was not detected under these conditions suggesting there is little or no pbrB expression in vegetative hyphal or yeast cells. to analyze pbrB expression further, a strain was generated that expresses a fusion construct in which pbrB is fused to GFP. es from the wild type (G681) strain (C) and the strain expressing the PbrB::GFP fusion (D) were prepared to observe expression of pbrB during conidiation. strong GFP fluorescence was observed in conidiophores of the pbrB(p)::pbrB::GFP strain. escence microscopy after immunostaining using an anti-melanin antibody staining for the wild type control (G681) and the PbrB::GFP fusion strain after growth on slides at 28\u00b0C for 10 days. samples were processed without the primary anti-melanin antibody step. deletion of pbrB did not result in any morphological defects in any of the conidiophore cell types. changes in phenotype indicates that PbrB has a unique function that cannot be compensated by other T. marneffei laccases. there was no difference in the germination of the pbrB and pbrB pbrB + strains at 28\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 24 hours then the number of germinated conidia were counted. pbrB cells from the pbrB and pbrB pbrB + strains were grown at 28\u00b0C for 3 days and examined microscopically. pbrB is required for the synthesis of DHN-melanin. pbrB mutant cultured in brain heart infusion broth at 37\u00b0C for 3 days was capable of catalyzing L-DOPA. pbrB cells growing at 37\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. the multicopper oxidase (MCO) family comprises enzymes that typically contain four copper atoms classified into three types (type 1 Cu, type 2 Cu and type 3 Cu) laccases can be found in various organisms (e.g. plants, fungi, bacteria and insects), but not in humans. T. marneffei pbrB is more closed to A. fumigatus Abr2 than A. nidulans YA. expression of the orthologous abr2 and yA genes occurs during conidiophore development but not during vegetative growth. the genus Aspergillus comprises many species and pigmented conidia appear in various colors among species. effects of inhibitors on DHN-melanin synthesis (using tricyclazole and phthalide) and DOPA-melanin synthesis (using kojic acid and tropolone) in a range of Aspergillus species are likely to be a common theme. tricyclazole alters the conidial color phenotype of A. fumigatus. it does not affect conidial coloration of A. nidulans, A. flavus, and A. parasiticus. YWA1 should be converted to 1,3,6,8-THN in T. marneffei. then 1,8-DHN is polymerized by PbrB laccase to form DHN-melanin. a consensus biochemical pathway for DHN melanin synthesis is shown. laccase enzyme is required for the synthesis of DHN-melanin in conidia. oxidase-encoding genes in the T. marneffei genome suggest that in addition to DHN-melanin, T. marneffei may also have the capacity to produce DOPA-melanin. gene cluster is conserved in A. fumigatus (Af) (AFUG_2G17530, abr2; AFUG_2G17540, abr1; AFUG_2G17550 ayg1; AFUG_2G17560 arp2; AFUG_2G17580 arp1 and AFUG_2G17600 alb1)."}
