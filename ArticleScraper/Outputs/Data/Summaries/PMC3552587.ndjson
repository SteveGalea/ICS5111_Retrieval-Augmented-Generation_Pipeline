{"summary": "upper respiratory tract disease (URD) is the primary health issue reported in cats during their stay in animal shelters (1) and post adoption (2,3) cats receiving treatment are subjected to extended periods of confinement with minimal human interaction (6). outbreaks of URD are common in animal shelters (7). the study examined the prevalence of subclinical upper respiratory infections in cats upon admission to an animal shelter. the study was part of a research project to examine emotional and immunological changes in anxious, frustrated, or content cats when provided with behavioral interventions. a sterile swab was rolled on the medial conjunctiva and another on the posterior oral-nasal pharynx. a sterile swab was rolled on the medial conjunctiva and another on the posterior oral-nasal pharynx. cats were vaccinated with a modified live vaccine. each test used a fluorescent probe that matched a unique segment of the organism\u2019s DNA or cDNA to ensure high specificity and sensitivity. real-time PCR was performed using the Roche LightCycler\u00ae 480 Probes Master mastermix (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, Indiana, USA) the P-values derived from a model adjusted for all other variables in the model are reported for these analyses. a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis (23) compared the percentage risk of developing URD by days 7, 14, 21 and > 30 (maximum of 40 d) according to characteristics such as carrier status, age, source, gender, and sterilization status. a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis compared the percentage risk of developing URD by days 7, 14, 21 and > 30 (maximum of 40 d) according to characteristics such as carrier status, age, source, gender, and sterilization status. a cox regression analysis using the survival package in R statistical software was used to determine if the risk of contracting URD over time was significantly affected. % B. b % Female 138 5 71 2 40 24 44 3 50 Male 112 2 29 3 60 30 56 3 50 OS 125 2 29 0 0 30 56 3 50 Stray 125 5 71 5 100 24 44 3 50 Fixed 148 1 14 1 20 18 33 2 33 Intact 102 6 86 4 80 36 67 4 67 Juvenile 50 4 57 5 100 27 50 2 33 Adult 134 1 14 0 0 9 17 1 17 Senior 66 new cats had a greater prevalence of URD (39%, n= 57) than intact cats (26%, n= 27) the risk of developing URD was 2.6 greater for carriers (53%, n = 47) than for non-carriers (23%, n = 37) 0.02 Sterilization Intact 102 75 (74) 27 (26) 1.00 Neutered 148 91 (61) 57 (39) 0.46 0.23\u20130.94 0.03 Age Adult 134 94 (70) 40 (30) 1.00 Juvenile 50 34 (68) 16 (32) 1.49 0.67\u20133.31 0.33 Senior 66 38 (58) 28 (42) 1.66 0.78\u20133.55 0.19 Carrier state Non-carrier 162 125 (77) 37 (23) 1.00 Car cats with subclinical infections had the greatest cumulative risk for URD. by day 14, the risk had increased to 46% for carriers compared to 2.7% for non-carriers. by day 14, the risk had increased to 46% for carriers compared with 13% for non-carriers. 28% (n = 69) of cats were carriers for 1 or more pathogens. 22%, 2.8%, 2.0%, and 2.4% were positive for M. felis, FCV, FHV-1, and B. bronchiseptica. subsequent swabs showed an increase of 9% and 11% over the 10 d in viral and bacterial infections. all cats remained negative for influenza H1N1 virus throughout the study. all cats remained negative for influenza H1N1 virus throughout the study.
