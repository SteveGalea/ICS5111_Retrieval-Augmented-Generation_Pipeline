{"summary": "the most clinically prevalent human hemorrhagic fever viruses belong to the families Arenaviridae, Filoviridae, Hantaviridae, and Flaviviridae [1,2], which share some structural and replicative characteristics. however, the pathogenesis and role of the immune system in the development of mild or severe disease is still not clear. here, we discuss the role of T-cells in the control of VHF and disease pathogenesis. common characteristics of viral hemorrhagic fever and the induced T-cell response. Lassa virus (LASV), ebola virus (EBOV), Hantaan virus (HNTV) and dengue virus (DENV) share some virologic and epidemiological characteristics. diseases are clinically dynamic, ranging from asymptomatic to severe disease and death. lack of approved specific therapy contributes to disease burden and unfavorable clinical outcomes. lack of approved specific therapy contributes to disease burden and unfavorable clinical outcomes. the severity and mortality associated with these Hantavirus syndromes vary according to the causative virus. death from HFRS is usually due to renal insufficiency, shock, or severe hemorrhage. in endemic areas of africa, approximately 1% of severe hepatitis may be caused by YFV infection. VHF are characterized by a massive T-cell activation, differentiation to effector profiles, and predominance of type-I effector mechanisms. a major similarity between VHF entities is the context-dependent protective and/or detrimental role of T-cells. several studies have shown associations between magnitude, phenotype, and/or function of T-cells and disease outcome in several VHF (survivors and non-survivors) non-survivor patients may not generate an efficient immune response in comparison with survivors. defects in the regulation of T-cell homeostasis are associated with severe disease and fatalities [43,44]. cells lack active activation capacity by antigen-presenting cells. low proliferative and cytokine T-cell response Low activation capacity by infected antigen-presenting cells. clinically relevant ssRNA viruses include respiratory syncytial virus, influenza virus, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus, and parainfluenza virus. in these diseases, lung-confined dendritic cells present viral antigens to T-cells located in regional lymph nodes. early during acute phase of infection, there is an increase of IFN- and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and interleukin (IL)-6 [33,67,68,69,70], oxygen and nitrogen reactive species [71], lipid mediators and other soluble factors. these mediators of inflammation are produced by antigen-presenting cells, endothelial cells, polymorphonuclear cells, NK cells, hepatocytes, among early during the acute phase of VHF, antigen-presenting cells produce high levels of type I IFN, and the inflammatory cytokines TNF- and IL-6, that induce the activation of T-cells. this phase coincides with high levels of viremia that decreases after the fourth to fifth day after the onset of symptoms. the next period (from day 5 to 10) is characterized by the development of most disease complications, such as shock, hemorrhage and organ damage regulatory T-cell subpopulations are important for the control of exacerbated immune responses and limit chronic inflammation. regulatory T-cell subpopulations are important for the control of exacerbated immune responses and limit chronic inflammation. unchanged or decreased proportions of regulatory CD4+ T-cells can be observed after immunization with the YF-17D vaccine. but this subset is activated after vaccination and its frequency positively correlates with the magnitude of total activated T-cells. other regulatory mechanisms, such as the expression of the inhibitory receptors cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 protein (PD-1) would exert a regulatory role in these diseases. secondary lymphoid organs and pronounced lymphopenia are also observed in fatal LASV infection. early low and delayed activation of T-cells, low cytokine production, and high viral loads are associated with fatal LASV disease. a cross-talk between dendritic cells and T-cells may be required for efficient cellular immune responses. despite the impairment in the T-cell response during LASV infection, evidence of their protective role in this disease include: (i) presence of strong and partially cross-reactive T-cell response in individuals who live in areas of LASV endemicity. evidence of their protective role in this disease include: (i) presence of a strong and partially cross-reactive T-cell response in individuals who live in areas of LASV endemicity. major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I knock-out mice exhibit persistent LASV replication. T-cells continue to encounter LASV epitopes and stimulate monocyte/macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines. some T-cell epitopes have been described for LASV proteins. mice immunized with the MOPV-LASV reassortant virus exhibit an IFN- response against the LASV glycoprotein 2. human CD4+ T-cells recognize a highly conserved 13 amino acid peptide located in the N-terminal part of LASV glycoprotein 2, with strong proliferation and IFN- production. vaccine candidates should be able to induce T-cells specific for LASV nucleoprotein and glycoprotein for efficient long-lasting protection. ive transfer of CD8+ T-cells from mice infected with a mouse-adapted EBOV confers protection to EBOV-challenged nave mice. the cytokine response to EBOV peptide stimulation is predominantly found in human CD8+ T-cells. excessive T-cell activation has been associated with fatal EBOV infection in humans. patients with mild disease and rapid viremia clearance have a faster contraction of the activated T-cell response. the response to viral nucleoprotein (NP) is present in the majority of patients, with the induction of IFN- and TNF- [48,50]. the success of the EBOV vaccine relies on the fact that NP is contributing structurally-stable particles to the vaccine. a good example is the recent success of an EBOV vaccine that expresses the EBOV GP and VP40, that form virus-like particles in vivo. a good example is the recent success of an EBOV vaccine that expresses the EBOV GP and VP40, that successfully protect NHP from lethal challenge. clinical remission after severe HFRS is also associated with a sustained IFN-/granzyme B CD8+ T-cell response. HTNV-specific CD8+ T-cells are required for efficient viral clearance in mice via production of IFN-, TNF-, and cytotoxicity. hantavirus nucleocapsid protein inhibits the activity of granzyme B and caspase 3-mediated apoptosis of infected endotheli a massive increase in the frequency of circulating Ki-67+ HLA-DR+ CD38+ CD8+ T-cells is observed in acute human hantaviruses infections. these cells exhibit low expression of CCR7, CD45RA, and CD127. inverse CD4:CD8 ratios are also observed during HFRS [148] the recognition of nucleocapsid protein is expected, as several hantaviruses share conserved sequences of this protein. however, clinically relevant viruses, such as Puumala virus, exhibit nucleocapsid protein sequence variants and different immunodominant epitopes. the glycoprotein contains an amino acid tail that selectively directs its proteasomal degradation. HTNV-induced meningoencephalitis in mice has been associated with T-cell mediated immunity. some HLA class I alleles, particularly the B8, have also been associated with severe Puumala virus infection. fulminant HPS is characterized by an increased frequency of cytokine-producing cells in the lungs. YF-17D replicates and exhibits a transient viremia, which stimulates the expansion of antigen-specific effector T-cells. yF-17D replicates and exhibits a transient viremia, which stimulates the expansion of antigen-specific effector T-cells. after YF-17D vaccination, there is an increase in the levels of soluble markers of immune activation, such as 2-microglobulin and neopterin. the peak of the CD4+ T-cell response appears to be earlier than that of CD8+ T-cells. this effector phase is followed by the acquisition of a memory profile. YF-17D induces a broad human T-cell response, with detectable cytokine production after stimulation with epitopes derived from each of the 10 YF-17D proteins [30,177]. this finding is consistent with the diverse T-cell receptor repertoire observed in YFV-specific T-cells post-vaccination [178,179]. proliferation of memory CD8+ T cells was observed after the effector phase. dividing only once each 485 days, but with survival for more than 2 years after immunization. neither the magnitude nor the quality of the YFV-specific CD8+ T-cell response is influenced by YF-17D vaccine boosters. human T-cells are a major target of a multiplicity of stimulating factors and chemoattractants derived from monocytes, dendritic cells, and B-cells. this could be related to the delayed appearance of DENV-specific T-cells, which in turn is associated with the development of severe manifestations [210,211]. a strong T-cell response is induced after DENV natural infection, exhibiting an effector memory phenotype, IFN- and TNF- production, and cytotoxic potential. a high frequency of memory T-cells specific for conserved epitopes of DENV serotypes is associated with protection against secondary clinical infection in endemic areas. there are at least 2,181 human T-cell epitopes identified in Flaviviruses. the dominant responses are directed against non-structural proteins (NS). NS3 has important sequence homologies with ZIKV and other flaviviruses. the most advanced is a tetravalent chimeric vaccine based on the live attenuated YF-17D vaccine (YF-17D-DENV vaccine), which incorporates the preM and E proteins of each DENV serotype. the tetravalent chimeric YF-17D-DENV vaccine has also demonstrated safety and immunogenicity in pre-clinical and clinical studies [235,236,237]. human vaccination with the TV003/TV005 vaccine elicits a strong polyfunctional NS3-specific response, comparable to that induced after natural infection [241,242]. this data support the inclusion of DENV NS proteins in vaccine candidates in order to improve the T-cell response and possibly the protection conferred by this vaccine. serotype cross-reactive DENV-specific T-cells have lower degranulation but higher production of proinflammatory cytokines. a pre-existing proinflammatory pattern of T-cells is associated with the subsequent development of severe secondary DENV infection. a long-lasting protective role of T-cells against DENV is associated with an efficient T-cell priming by antigen-presenting cells. antigen-specific priming of T-cells can lead to the generation of highly functional antigen-specific T-cells. antigen-specific priming of T-cells under the context of protective HLA alleles can lead to the generation of highly functional antigen-specific T-cells. high frequencies of antigen-specific T-cells can preserve long-lasting immunity and protection against subsequent related viral infections. LCMV-WE-WE macaques model for pathogenic LASV infection of humans. alterations in T-cells may account for unchecked viral replication and severity of LASV disease. a cross-talk between dendritic cells and T-cells may be required. iii) survival of LASV-infected macaques associated with activation, proliferation and cytokine production by T-cells in response to LASV antigens. increased proportion of activated CD69+/CD25+ and proliferating Ki-67+ T-cells is also observed in nonfatal disease. a decrease in the proportion of activated HLA-DR+ CD38+ T-cells is also observed in surviving human beings. antigen-specific CD8+ T-cells exhibited high production of IFN- and TNF-. some T-cell epitopes have been described for LASV proteins. ex vivo stimulation with LASV nucleoprotein peptides elicits a proliferative and cytokine response in human T-cells. vaccine candidates should be able to induce T-cells specific for LASV nucleoprotein and glycoprotein for efficient long-lasting protection. EBOV disease is characterized by apoptosis of T-cells [116], which has been attributed to activation-induced cell death mechanisms, direct lysis via EBOV GP [117], and increased lymphocyte apoptosis [53]. e response to EBOV peptide stimulation predominantly found in human CD8+ T-cells. increased frequencies of activated HLA-DR+ CD38+ cells, proliferating Ki-67 cells, CD45RA CCR7 (effector memory) and CD45RA+ CCR7 (terminal effector memory) cells. excessive T-cell activation has been associated with fatal EBOV infection in humans. most abundant and conserved protein among filoviruses is present in the majority of patients, with the induction of IFN- and TNF- [48,50] Reactions to peptides derived from Ebola glycoprotein (GP) and viral protein 24 (VP24), VP30, VP35, and VP40 are more variable among individuals, and of lower magnitude. most of the vaccine candidates against EBOV, such as cAd3-EBOV, rVSV follicular CXCR5+ CD4+ T-cell subset is expanded after filoviruses-like particle vaccination in mice [134,135] follicular CXCR5+ CD4+ T-cell subset is expanded after filoviruses-like particle vaccination in mice [134,135]. a low IFN- T-cell response is also associated with severe HFRS [140]. hantavirus nucleocapsid protein inhibits the activity of granzyme B and caspase 3-mediated apoptosis of infected endothelial cells. hantavirus nucleocapsid protein inhibits the activity of granzyme B and caspase 3-mediated apoptosis of infected endothelial cells. HTNV nucleocapsid protein epitopes restricted by HLA-C7 and HLA-B35 are also recognized by T-cells in patients with HFRS [45,138], or in individuals with laboratory-acquired HTNV infections [150] the recognition of nucleocapsid protein is expected, as several hantaviruses share conserved sequence variants of this protein. immunization of bank voles with nucleocapsid protein elicits cross-protective T-cell responses against hantavirus infections. HTNV-induced meningoencephalitis in mice has been associated with T-cell mediated immunity. fatal HPS is characterized by increased frequency of cytokine-producing cells in the lungs [162]. unchanged frequencies of regulatory T-cells, lower expression of inhibitory receptors in CD8+ T-cells and decreased levels of the regulatory cytokine IL-10 could also contribute to an exacerbated T-cell response during hantavirus infection. studies that define these immune features are required to improve disease management and prognosis. YF-17D-vaccinated mice abolishes vaccine-induced control of intracerebral viral challenge. cytokine-producing human CD4+ T-cells expressing CD40L are associated with neutralizing antibodies after YF-17D vaccination. long-lived memory T-cells are observed after two to three months post-vaccination. the peak of the CD4+ T-cell response appears to be earlier than that of CD8+ T-cells. YFV-specific CD8+ T-cells follow a similar kinetics, but remain detectable 6\u201312 months post-vaccination. a high expression of T-bet (transcription factor which characterize effector cells) is also observed early after vaccination. the magnitude of the T-cell response is also associated with the \u201cpromiscuous\u201d binding of YF-17D epitopes to HLA class II molecules [181]. different effector T-cell profiles, such as type-I and II effector mechanisms can be observed. YFV tetramer+ cells are detectable 18\u201325 years after a single vaccination. the magnitude of the human CD8+ T-cell response after primary YF-17D immunization is highly determined by the initial viral load. this mechanism explains the highly protective immune responses elicited after a single immunization with the YF-17D. s are a major target of a multiplicity of stimulating factors and chemoattractants. serotype cross-reactivity of DENV-specific T-cells generated during primary infection, their exacerbated cytokine and lytic response inducing organ damage, competition with T-cells avid for the current infecting serotype. a high frequency of memory T-cells specific for conserved epitopes of DENV serotypes is associated with protection against secondary clinical infection in endemic areas. individuals with an early DENV-specific T-cell IFN- response exhibit lower viremia and develop milder clinical disease [218] there are at least 2,181 human T-cell epitopes identified in Flaviviruses. the dominant responses are directed against non-structural proteins (NS), particularly NS3. tetravalent chimeric vaccine based on the live attenuated YF-17D-DENV vaccine (YF-17D-DENV vaccine) cellular immunity could have a complementary role in this conferred protection. human antigen-specific T-cells induced by the tetravalent YF-17D-DENV vaccine are directed against YFV, but not DENV NS3 protein. this could explain the higher incidence of hospitalization for dengue fever in children younger than 9 years of age. LA-DR+ CD38+ cells constituting more than 50% of the total circulating CD8+ T-cells in some individuals. but only a small fraction of these activated CD8+ T-cells are DENV-specific. most of the DENV-specific T-cells are low-affinity serotype cross-reactive. PD-1 by DENV-specific CD8+ T-cells is a correlate of protection associated with anti-viral mechanisms. a long-lasting protective role of T-cells against DENV is associated with an efficient T-cell priming by antigen-presenting cells. death of high-affinity DENV-specific T-cells induces predominance of low-affinity, bystander-activated T-cells. T-cells are critical for the control of human VHF. the magnitude of their response is related to disease severity, survival, and protection. the induction of an efficient T-cell response is also a correlate of vaccine-induced protection."}
