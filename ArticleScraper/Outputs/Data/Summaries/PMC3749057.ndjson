{"summary": "members of the genus norovirus in the family Caliciviridae are responsible for the majority of non-bacterial gastroenteritis outbreaks worldwide. genogroup II, genotype 4 (GII.4) noroviruses (NoVs) are the predominant circulating strain. a number of candidate vaccines have been proposed. the gnotobiotic (Gn) pig model shares significant similarities with humans in physiology, immunology, histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) phenotypes and virus binding patterns. we determined the ID50 of the GII.4 2006b variant in simvastatin-treated versus simvastatin-free pigs. the cholesterol levels among a set of ten pigs tested in one trial were significantly lowered by simvastatin treatment at a dose of 8 mg day1 for 11 days. the mean serum cholesterol concentration was reduced from 98 to 79 mg dl1, a mean reduction of 17 %. in another two trials with a set of six and seven pigs each, the same dosage of simvastatin treatment reduced the mean serum cholesterol from 142 to 80 mg dl1 and 67 % of those receiving 2.74103 RNA copies of NoV showed signs of diarrhoea. the incidence of diarrhoea increased to 100 % in neonatal pigs. a tendency for older pigs to have looser faeces. mean days with diarrhoea (%)|| Shedding (%) Mean onset (days) Mean days with shedding (%)|| Geometric mean peak titre shed (RNA copies ml1) 2.74103 6 67 (4/6) ab 4.5 (1.1) b 32 a 50 (3/6) ab 4.7 (1.5) ab 11 b 4.34101 b 2.74105 3 100 (3/3) a 5.3 (0.3) ab 29 a 100 (3/3) a 3.3 Gn pigs were challenged with 2.74103 to 2.74106 viral RNA copies of NoV 092895 at 33\u201334 days of age. Rectal swabs were collected daily after challenge to determine virus shedding by conventional and real-time RT-PCR. na, Not applicable. the onset for non-shedding pigs was designated 8 for calculating the mean days to onset (pigs were all euthanized before day 7 p.i.). sem is indicated in parentheses. simvastatin-fed pigs shed virus in faeces as determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) pigs shed virus in faeces as determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. pigs inoculated with a higher dose of virus inoculum displayed a higher rate of virus shedding. a subset of pigs within the different dosage groups was euthanized on days 3\u20134 p.i. for the pathogenesis study. LIC samples positive for virus shedding are present in lanes 9\u201312. LIC samples negative for virus shedding are in lanes 7, 8 and 13. simvastatin-fed pigs were challenged with 2.74103\u20132.74106 viral RNA copies noV 092895 at 33\u201334 days of age. all dosage groups greater than 2.74103 RNA copies exhibited a 100 % shedding rate. the 2.74106 and 2.74105 groups had significantly longer duration of shedding than either of the two lowest dosage groups. infection status Peak virus titres shed (RNA copies ml1) Total amount of virus shed at peak (RNA copies) Pig Inoculum dose (viral RNA copies) Infection status Peak virus titres shed (RNA copies ml1) Total amount of virus shed at peak (RNA copies) 1 2.74103 No 0 0 1 2.74103 No 0 0 2 2.74103 No 0 0 2 2.74103 Yes 5.58103 5.58105 3 2.74103 No 0 0 3 pigs were fed 8 mg simvastatin day1 for 11 days prior to challenge. total amount of virus shed is based on a mean intestinal volume of 100 ml. simvastatin increases susceptibility to noV infection and incidence of diarrhoea. pigs were considered infected if rectal swab or intestinal content samples tested positive by conventional RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR. the ID50 for neonatal pigs was 2.74103 viral RNA copies as the lowest dose administered produced a 50 % infection rate. no major changes were observed in haematoxylin and eosin stained intestinal sections of infected pigs compared with mock-inoculated controls. hetham et al., 2006; souza et al., 2008; souza et al., 2008; souza et al., 2008) major changes observed in noV-infected pigs included irregular microvilli (asterisk), cytoplasmic vacuolization (block arrows) signs of necrosis included shrunken and darker cells, disrupted cell membranes, loss of organelles and damaged mitochondria. the incidence of diarrhoea increased to 100 % in neonatal pigs. the incidence of diarrhoea increased to 100 % in neonatal pigs. pigs were challenged with GII.4 2006b variant (inoculum 092895) at 4\u20135 days of age. we observed a tendency for older pigs to have looser faeces. we observed a tendency for the older pigs to have looser faeces. scores of 2 or greater were considered to be diarrhoea. the onset of diarrhoea or shedding for non-diarrhoeic/shed pigs was designated 8. non-simvastatin-fed pigs Inoculum dose (RNA copies) n Shedding (%)* Mean onset (days) Mean days with shedding (%) Geometric mean peak titre shed (RNA copies ml1) No. of pigs infected Infected pigs with diarrhoea|| 2.74103 4 25 (1/4) ab 6.8 (1.3) a 6.3 b 1.29101 bc 1 1 2.74104 5 40 a 1.0 (0) c 70 a 1.89104 a 5 4 Control 11 0 (0/11) b 8.0 (0) a 0 c 0 b na na Total of virus-inoculated pigs 15 14 (93 %) 11 (79 %) Gn pigs shed virus in faeces as determined by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) and quantified by TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. pigs inoculated with a higher dose of virus inoculum displayed a higher, but not significant rate of virus shedding. pigs inoculated at 4\u20135 days of age with 2.74105 RNA copies were all kept until day 7 p.i. they all shed virus for 3\u20134 days (42 % of the swab days) only three of the six pigs inoculated with 2.74103 RNA copies shed virus. ly longer virus shedding was accompanied with significantly earlier mean onset of shedding (days 1 and 1.3 p.i.) in the two highest dosage groups compared with the two lowest dosage groups (days 3.3 and 3.8 p.i.). the mean volume of intestinal contents in pigs at 33\u201334 days of age is approximately 100 ml. pigs were fed 8 mg simvastatin day1 for 11 days prior to challenge. total amount of virus shed is based on a mean intestinal volume of 100 ml. simvastatin increases susceptibility to noV infection. the simvastatin-fed pigs had significantly earlier onset of virus shedding than the simvastatin-free pigs (1.3 versus 5.7 days) the total incidence of infection among pigs in the simvastatin-fed group was 93 % compared with 53 % in the simvastatin-free group. simvastatin feeding lowered the ID50 compared with the simvastatin-free pigs. pigs at 33\u201334 days of age had a higher ID50 of 6.43104 RNA copies. noV antigen was detected at the damaged tips of the duodenal villi. guinea pigs were stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-guinea pig IgG (green) nuclei were stained with propidium iodide (red) duodenal tissue from a mock-inoculated Gn pig at 37 days of age (a) and an NoV-infected Gn pig at day 3 p.i. (37 days of age) (b) control pigs that received 2.74106 RNA copies NoV 092895 were treated with simvastatin. major changes observed in noV-infected pigs included irregular microvilli (asterisk), cytoplasmic vacuolization (block arrows) signs of apoptosis (white arrow) included shrunken and darker cells, condensed nuclei and chromatin margination. neonatal pigs had a lower ID50 of 2.74103 viral RNA copies. the ID50 was approximately 23-fold higher at 6.43104 viral RNA copies in the older pigs. the higher dose required to infect the older pigs is probably due to the more developed innate immune system of these pigs. norwalk virus (GI.1) has a low ID50 of only 4.8 RT-PCR units. higher incidences of diarrhoea were observed among the infected pigs treated with simvastatin compared with those not receiving simvastatin. strains may vary in their ability to cause diarrhoea in Gn pigs. strains may also affect levels of virus shedding observed in faeces of noV-infected pigs. an emerging GII.12 strain induced shedding titres of 1105\u20132107 genomic equivalents ml1 following challenge with 61010 genomic equivalents. further adaptation may occur with serial passage of the intestinal contents and a subsequent increase in virus replication and shedding occurring in Gn pigs. chimpanzee studies used norwalk virus (GI.1) and gn pig studies used GII.4 variants. HS66-infected pigs showed only very subtle changes in intracellular morphology observable only by TEM. differences may be due to the better adaptability of strain 092895. Gn pigs are a better animal model of human noV infection and disease than other currently available candidates. we report similar findings to previous studies of human noV pathogenesis in Gn pigs, including faecal virus shedding. the stool sample was diluted to 10 % in diluent #5 (minimal essential medium with 1 % penicillin-streptomycin and 1 % HEPES) and treated by high-speed centrifugation to remove bacteria. Absence of other contaminating viruses was confirmed by testing on a virochip microarray. simvastatin was given orally at a dose of 8 mg day1 for 11 days prior to virus inoculation with noV. as the younger pigs were inoculated at 4\u20135 days of age, they did not receive any simvastatin treatment. PCR blood typing was conducted with DNA isolated from whole blood using DNAzol Genomic DNA Isolation Reagent. at least 50 ng genomic DNA was required to perform the PCR. internal control primers Pig5\u2032 (5\u2032-CCCTGGAACTCTGTC-3\u2032) and Pig3\u2032 (5\u2032-CTGCACGTAGCACCAGGGTCT-3\u2032 were also included. pigs were rectally swabbed daily following inoculation with GII.4 human NoV variant 092895 to assess diarrhoea and noV shedding. pigs inoculated at 33\u201334 days of age were scored based on a more stringent system: 0, solid; 1, pasty; 2, semi-liquid; 4, liquid. RNA was dissolved in 30\u201340 l RNase-free molecular-grade water for use in conventional RT-PCR and TaqMan real-time RT-PCR. a two-step protocol was followed using the degenerate primer set p290HIJK/p289HI designed to detect NoVs and sapoviruses. l RNA, extracted from either rectal swabs or LIC and SIC, was used for the 25 l reaction with a SensiMix Probe One-Step kit (Bioline) Negative and positive controls were included as described above for conventional RT-PCR. a standard curve was included using plasmid DNA containing the COG2 amplicon serially diluted from 1107 to 1 genomic copy. duodenum and jejunum samples collected upon euthanasia were fixed in 4 % paraformaldehyde-PBS. sections were cut and collected on positively charged slides. staining procedure was adapted from previous studies. a single pool of stool containing the GII.4 2006b variant was collected from a child with noV gastroenteritis in 2008. the stool sample was diluted to 10 % in diluent #5 and treated by high-speed centrifugation to remove bacteria. pigs were euthanized at day 3, 4 or 7 p.i. to collect intestinal contents and tissues. simvastatin was given orally at a dose of 8 mg day1 for 11 days prior to virus inoculation with noV. pigs are more likely to be infected than A or H pigs.
