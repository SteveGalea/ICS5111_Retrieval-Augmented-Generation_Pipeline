{"summary": "uncoating may be divided into two stages for poxviruses. the first stage of uncoating begins almost immediately upon infection. this step involves fusion of the viral envelope with the host plasma or endosomal membrane. the second stage of uncoating begins after a lag. a screen carried out with single siRNAs would not detect two or more genes that have mutually redundant functions. deletion of open reading frame (ORF) 186 led to a defect in DNA replication and late gene expression in mammalian cells without affecting replication in chicken embryo fibroblasts. a deletion of the 68k-ank ORF from MVA resulted in a block in postreplicative gene expression in several mammalian cell lines. however, deletion of the ORF encoding the 68k-ank homolog of VACV strain WR did not adversely affect replication. the intermediate/late A3 protein by MVA-186 was specifically diminished in human lung carcinoma A549, human cervical carcinoma epithelial HeLa, human embryonic kidney 293-T. similar amounts of the early I3 protein were produced by parental MVA, MVA-GFP, and MVA-186 in each of the cell lines. thus, the 68k-ank protein plays a critical role in MVA postreplicative gene expression in several different mammalian cells. nuclear EdU fluorescence was bright in mock-infected HeLa cells. dim or absent by 3 h after infection with either MVA or MVA-186. deletion of 68k-ank protein prevents viral genome replication. each panel is divided into quadrants: upper left, I3 (red); upper right, EdU (green); lower left, DAPI (blue); and lower right, merge. the scale bar represents 10 m. hpi, hours postinfection. the number of cores decreased by 4 h in MVA-infected cells due to uncoating and degradation. but they increased markedly in cells infected with MVA-186, suggesting core stabilization under the latter conditions. the large difference between MVA and MVA-186 also occurred in the presence of AraC but not in the presence of CHX. in untreated cells, I3 produced at 1 h by intact cores appeared diffuse. at 4 h considerable I3 protein localized with DNA in viral factories. uncoating as assessed by both core destabilization and release of genomic DNA was inhibited. the number of copies determined by ddPCR was much higher (P 0.01) for MVA than for MVA-186. we concluded that the 68k-ank protein has roles in promoting both uncoating and DNA synthesis. we compared the syntheses of the intermediate/late A3 and early I3 proteins by the parent VACV WR and the WR deletion mutant by Western blotting. no reduction in gene expression was observed, suggesting one or more genes in VACV WR compensated for the loss of the 68k-ank homolog. the indicated cells were infected with 0.5 PFU/cell of parental VACV WR strain (WR) or VACV WR B18R (B18R) for 16 h. proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with antibodies to the A3 intermediate/late protein (upper row) and early I3 protein (middle row) a cassette containing the late P11 promoter fused to the mCherry ORF was introduced simultaneously to allow visualization and isolation of fluorescent recombinant plaques. rMVA-186-C17-C12 failed to show increased A3 gene expression, but both rMVA-186-M1-K1 and rMVA-186-C5-C1 did. enlargement shows missing ORFs within deletion I (C17-C12), deletion V (C5-C1), and deletion II (M1-K1). diagram representing the genome of MVA-186 and DNA containing the mCherry ORF regulated by the P11 promoter followed by an insert containing an individual ORF (C1, C2, C3, C5, K1, or M2). Western blotting showed that only ORFs C5 and M2 compensated for the 68k-ank gene. we also confirmed that rMVA-186-C5 and rMVA-186-M2 no longer had a defect in viral DNA replication by assessing EdU incorporation and I3 labeling in HeLa cells. the 68k-ank gene is required for MVA DNA replication and postreplicative gene expression in a variety of mammalian cell lines. however, the ability to spread was restored by either C5 or M2 expression. the 68k-ank protein is required for MVA DNA replication and postreplicative gene expression in a variety of mammalian cell lines. the 68k-ank protein plays a critical role in MVA postreplicative gene expression in several different mammalian cell lines. however, similar amounts of the early I3 protein were produced by parental MVA, MVA-GFP, and MVA-186 in each of the cell lines. however, similar amounts of the early I3 protein were produced by parental MVA, MVA-GFP, and MVA-186. nuclear EdU fluorescence was bright in mock-infected HeLa cells. dim or absent by 3 h after infection with either MVA or MVA-186. small EdU-labeled viral factories were seen only occasionally. data also show that viral DNA replication was not necessary for the decrease in nuclear DNA synthesis. the scale bar represents 10 m. hpi, hours postinfection. it was important to determine whether the defect in DNA synthesis might be a secondary effect. deletion of MVA ORF 186 encoding the 68k-ank protein prevents viral genome uncoating. cells were untreated or treated with 100 g/ml of cycloheximide (CHX) or 44 g/ml of cytosine arabinoside (AraC) after 1 h of adsorption at 4\u00b0C, the cells were washed and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 or 4 h. aC, punctate I3 staining of genomes released from cores could be seen at 4 h after infection with MVA but not after infection with MVA-186. 68k-ank protein is required for DNA synthesis in addition to uncoating. this does not preclude an additional direct block in DNA synthesis. the methylated template plasmids and unmethylated replicated DNA are represented by gray and red circles. total DNA was extracted and digested with BamHI to cut DNA into unit-length segments and DpnI to cleave methylated template plasmids. after digestion, droplet digital PCR was performed to detect newly synthesized DNA. we considered two approaches that might help identify the putative compensating genes. one was to make additional deletions in VACV WR. however, this approach might fail if more than one compensating gene was present. the second tactic was to insert additional genes into MVA-186. proteins resolved by SDS-PAGE, transferred to membranes, and probed with antibodies to the A3 intermediate/late protein and actin. indicated cells were infected with 0.5 PFU/cell of MVA, MVA-GFP, MVA-186, and recombinant rMVAs 44/47.1, 44.2, 51.1, 44/47.1-186, 44.2-186, and 51.1-186 for 16 h. rMVA-186-C17-C12 failed to show increased A3 gene expression. both rMVA-186-M1-K1 and rMVA-186-C5-C1 did. therefore, at least two compensatory genes were present in rMVA 51.1. the Western blot shows A3 protein and an actin loading control from cells infected for 16 h with 0.5 PFU/cell of MVA, rMVA-186-C17-C12, rMVA-186-M1-K1 or rMVA-186-C5-C1. to identify the compensatory genes, the individual ORFs were amplified by PCR from rMVA 51.1. HeLa cells were infected with 5 PFU/cell of MVA, MVA-186, rMVA-186-C5 or rMVA-186-M2. at 3 h after infection, the cells were incubated with EdU (10 M) and then fixed, permeabilized, and reacted with Alexa Fluor 647 azide. DAPI was used to stain total DNA. images were collected with a confocal microscope. the ubiquitin-proteosome system facilitates uncoating or DNA synthesis. the ubiquitin-proteosome system plays a key role in uncoating. the ubiquitin-proteosome system facilitates uncoating. a mutant virus unable to replicate its genome might have a primary block in uncoating. we were intrigued by a report by Sperling and coworkers. they found that the 68k-ank protein of MVA is required for DNA replication and late gene expression. the 68k-ank protein has four ankyrin repeats near the N terminus and an F-box-like domain that interacts with components of the SCF (Skp1, cullin1, F-box-containing complex) the 68k-ank protein has four ankyrin repeats near the N terminus and an F-box-like domain that interacts with components of the SCF (Skp1, cullin1, F-box-containing complex) k/PRANC is found in proteins encoded by nearly all poxvirus genera. k/PRANC is found in proteins encoded by nearly all poxvirus genera. the role of the F-box domain of the MVA 68k-ank protein is uncertain. ubiquitin ligase is needed for VACV DNA replication. a role for C5 as a cullin-3 adaptor is an interesting possibility. a redundancy of the 68k-ank, C5 and M2 genes is related to synthetic lethality. ox virus complete single-gene knockout bacterial artificial chromosome library was constructed, and infectious virus was successfully recovered for 109 of the 183 clones. however, dobson and Tscharke pointed out the difficulty due to redundancy in defining essential and nonessential genes of orthopoxviruses. inverted terminal repetitions were identified and junctions sequenced to generate the final genome drafts. PCR and Sanger sequencing were also done for mutations within coding regions to correct mismatches caused by sequencing errors. the segments were PCR amplified and inserted downstream of P11 VACV promoter-driven mCherry in a modified pLW44-derived vector. expression of each gene was confirmed by ddPCR. s were infected with purified virus (5 PFU per cell) at 4\u00b0C for 1 h to allow attachment. cells were fixed, permeabilized, and immunostained as described above. ated plasmid DNA was quantified by ddPCR using primers 5\u2032-CTTCATTTAAAAGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAAAAAGAGTGTGTAGCTCTTG-3\u2032. ddPCR was performed using IBM SPSS 11.5 software. a panel of human replication-competent recombinant MVAs (rMVAs) (44/47.1, 44.2, and 51.1) with segments of added DNA was described previously (33). the inverted terminal repetitions were identified and junctions sequenced to generate the final genome drafts. PCR and Sanger sequencing were also done for mutations within coding regions to correct mismatches caused by sequencing errors or homopolymers. the segments were PCR amplified and inserted downstream of P11 VACV promoter-driven mCherry in a modified pLW44-derived vector (60) the plasmid was transfected into CEF that were infected with MVA-186, and fluorescent foci that expressed both GFP and mCherry were picked and purified. anti-A4 rabbit polyclonal antibody (62), anti-I3 mouse MAb (61) and appropriate secondary antibodies were used for immunostaining. images were collected with a leica laser-scanning confocal microscope. cells stained with anti-A4 antibody were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay. data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS 11.5 software. Statistical differences were determined using Student's t test."}
