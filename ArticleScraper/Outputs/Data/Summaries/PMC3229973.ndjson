{"summary": "the PK-resistant prion protein (PrPSc) is the only known component of the infectious prions associated with a group of fatal neurodegenerative disorders. it has been well documented that PrPSc is derived from a PK-sensitive cellular PrPC in the central nervous system through an alpha-helix to beta-sheet structural transition. however, the specific molecular mechanism(s) behind the PrP conversion remain poorly understood. a PK-resistant PrP (PrPres) species exhibited higher affinity for anti-PrP monoclonal antibody 1E4 with an epitope between residues 97 and 105 [6], compared to anti-PrP antibody 3F4. glycans at the second site (N197) are basic, whereas glycans at the first site (N181) are acidic. glycans at the second site (N181) are the mutation also altered glycosylation at both the first and second sites. the mutation blocked the V14 epitope, which was mimicked by reduction and alkylation. the mutation failed to detect the glycosylated and de- or un-glycosylated PrP. the molecular weight of PrPF198S decreased more than that of PrPT183A compared to wild type controls. the small degree of change in the molecular weight might not be detectable by Western blotting. all three PrP molecules exhibited the same molecular charge with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI of 9.39) conformers detected preferentially by 1E4 anti-PrP antibody in cultured neuronal cells. prPWt migrated as three major bands of one di-glycosylated (36-48 kDa), two mono-glycosylated (34-36 kDa and 32-33 kDa, respectively), and one un-glycosylated (27-28 kDa) forms. a single band migrating at 28-36 mono181: PrP monoglycosylated at the second site. untreated PrP was virtually undetectable in all three cell lysates before PK treatment. 1E4 detected mutant, but not wild type, PK-resistant forms. resistant monoglycosylated species had two PK-resistant bands. the mobility of di- but not mono-glycosylated PrPF198S was slightly slower than that of PK-resistant PrPSc from sCJD. the mobility of the monoglycosylated PrPT183A (second site) was slower than that of glycans from cell lysates. 3F4 immunostaining was reduced to almost insignificant levels when wild type cells were treated with PK. 1E4 immunostaining was decreased after PK-treatment, which was opposite to that observed in Western blots. most PrPWt was recovered in the top fractions, i.e. fractions 1-2, whereas a small amount of PrP was observed in fraction 1. only a very small amount of PrP was observed in fraction 2. E4 detected PK-resistant iPrP in all three PrP species. but small amounts of PK-resistant PrP were only observed in fraction 10 for PrPWt and PrPF198S. a larger amount of PK-resistant PrP was detected in fractions 10 and 11 for PrPT183A. glycans at the two N-linked glycosylation sites of the PK-resistant iPrPC are different in their molecular weight. probed with 3F4 showed PK-resistant prion protein migrating at 23-26 kDa with isoelectric points (pI) from pH 8.0 to 9.5. an intense spot at pH 8.8 was also detected. these spots correspond to mono197 since first glycosylation site is eliminated. cell lysates containing PrPWt (E and H), PrPT183A (F and I) or PrPF198S (G and D) were treated with PK at 25 g/ml prior to Western blotting. blots A, B, E, F, and G were probed with 3F4, whereas blots C, D, H, I, and J were probed with 1E4. rP indicated that glycans at the second site are more basic, whereas glycans at the first site are more acidic. 1E4 has higher affinity for PK-resistant iPrP compared to 3F4. the effect of the two mutations by themselves on the charge of the proteins was not predicted. the V61 epitope was deduced to locate in the region before amino acid 171 to the first glycosylation site. the glycan chain was smaller at the first glycosylation site than at the second site. the top band migrating at 33-35 kDa represents the monoglycosylated PrP. the top band migrating at 26-28 is PK-resistant PrP monoglycosylated at the first site (mono181 +PK) the second band migrating at 19 kDa is PK-resistant unglycosylated PrP (Un + PK) the third faint band was detected at 18.5 kDa. the band migrating at 29-31 kDa corresponds to the unglycosylated full-length PrP. after treatment with PK, two bands became detectable migrating at 29-30 kDa and 19-20 kDa respectively. V14 mainly detected the unglycosylated PrPT183A migrating at 29-32 kDa and N-terminally truncated C1 at 18 kDa. no bands were detected by V61 in all three cell lysates containing PrPF198S. the inability of V14 to detect PrPF198S raises two possibilities. the residue Phe itself is a key element of the epitope and the F198S mutation completely blocks V14 binding. the residue Phe is out of the epitope, as demonstrated by the X-ray crystallography study. P23-231 was treated with MCT alone, TBP alone, or MCT plus TBP prior to Western blotting with 3F4, 6H4, V14 and V61. however, we were unable to find convincing epitopes for V14 and V61 antibodies using a 99 13-mer peptide membrane array. this is consistent with the observation reported by Moudjou et al. [16] suggesting that they have conformational epitopes even though they are able to detect all three different PrP species were observed to have a band migrating at 28-29 kDa corresponding to deglycosylated and unglycosylated PrP. only PrPWt and PrPF198S exhibited a band migrating at 20 kDa corresponding to endogenously truncated fragment C2. glycans removed from PrPSc after treatment with endo H. electron microscopy of three types of cultured cells. lysosome had characteristic differences between cells expressing different species. the molecular weight of PrPF198S decreased more than that of PrPT183A compared to wild type controls. but the small degree of change in the molecular weight might not be detectable by Western blotting. all three PrP molecules exhibited the same molecular charge with a theoretical isoelectric point (pI of 9.39) PrPWt migrated as three major bands of one di-glycosylated (36-48 kDa), two mono-glycosylated (34-36 kDa and 32-33 kDa, respectively), and one un-glycosylated (27-28 kDa) forms. a single band migrating at 28-36 kDa, corresponding to the monoglycosylated PrP, was detected in cell lysates untreated PrP was virtually undetectable in all three cell lysates before PK treatment. 1E4 detected mutant, but not wild type, PK-resistant forms. 1E4 revealed an intense band migrating at 23-25 kDa. a 32-39 kDa band corresponding to di-glycosylated PrP and a 26-29 kDa band corresponding to monoglycosylated PrP. the mobility of the monoglycosylated PrPT183A was slightly slower than that of PK-resistant PrPSc from sCJD. 3F4 immunostaining was reduced to almost insignificant levels when wild type cells were treated with PK. 1E4 immunostaining was decreased after PK-treatment, which was opposite to that observed in Western blots. most PrPWt was recovered in the top fractions, i.e. fractions 1-2, whereas a small amount of PrP was observed in fraction 1. only a very small amount of PrP was observed in fraction 2. two-dimensional gel electrophoresis of iPrPC from cultured neuronal cells expressing PrPWt, PrPT183A, or PrPF198S. a larger amount of PK-resistant PrP was detected in fractions 10 and 11 for PrPT183A. the monoglycosylated PrP species at the second site, residue 197 (mono197), migrated faster than those monoglycosylated at the first site, residue 181 (mono18 prion protein migrating at 23-26 kDa with isoelectric points (pI) from pH 8.0 to 9.5. an intense spot at pH 8.8 was also detected. these spots represent di-glycosylated PrP species. cell lysates containing PrPWt (E and H), PrPT183A (F and I) or PrPF198S (G and D) were treated with PK plus PNGase F prior to Western blotting. blots A, B, E, F, and G were probed with 3F4, whereas blots C, D, H, I, and J were probed with 1E4. 2-D blots showed that 1E4 has higher affinity for PK-resistant iPrP compared to 3F4. the effect of the two mutations by themselves on the charge of the proteins was not predicted. the three types of proteins have either distinct N-terminal protease sites or distinct GPI anchors. the V61 epitope was deduced to locate in the region before amino acid 171 to the first glycosylation site. the glycan chain was smaller at the first glycosylation site than at the second site. the top band migrating at 33-35 kDa represents the monoglycosylated PrP. the top band migrating at 26-28 is PK-resistant PrP monoglycosylated at the first site. the second band migrating at 19 kDa is PK-resistant unglycosylated PrP. the third faint band was detected at 18.5 kDa. the band migrating at 29-31 kDa represents C1 monoglycosylated at the second site (mono197-C1) after treatment with PK, two bands became detectable migrating at 29-30 kDa and 19-20 kDa respectively. V14 mainly detected the unglycosylated PrPT183A migrating at 29-32 kDa and N-terminally truncated C1 at 18 kDa. no bands were detected in treated and untreated cell lysates containing PrPF198S. the inability of V14 to detect PrPF198S raises two possibilities. the residue Phe itself is a key element of the epitope and the F198S mutation completely blocks V14 binding. the mutation may affect the disulfide bond between residues 179 and 214. we previously used peptide membrane array to re-map epitopes of 1E4 and 3F4 antibodies. however, we were unable to find convincing epitopes for V14 and V61 antibodies using a 99 13-mer peptide membrane array. this covers the entire human PrP sequence from residues 23 to 231. results consistent with the observation reported by Moudjou et al. all three different PrP species were observed to have a band migrating at 28-29 kDa corresponding to deglycosylated and unglycosylated PrP. only PrPWt and PrPF198S exhibited a band migrating at 20 kDa corresponding to endogenously N-terminally truncated fragment C2. cells expressing mutant PrP were examined by electron microscopy. mutations at residue 181, asn-Ile-Thr residues 181-183, and residue 197, asn-Phe-Thr residues 197-199 are linked to two distinct familial prion diseases. mice mutated at T182 alone or at both T182 and T198 in CHO cells failed to reach the cell surface but those mutated at T198 did. all three mutant PrP acquired PrPSc-like physicochemical properties reminiscent of PrPSc. the majority of the iPrPC associated with the T183A mutation may be the result of its PrP intracellular accumulation, raising the possibility that iPrPC is derived predominantly from intracellular PrP species. the two mutations significantly altered N-linked glycosylation at N181. the majority of glycans at the first or second site were bi- and tri-antennary structures with a mass range of approximately 1.66-2.34 kDa. the second site mainly contained tri- and tetra-antennary structures with a mass range of approximately 1.66-2.34 kDa. the molecular mass of glycans is greater at the second than the first site on the human PK-resistant PrPSc from sCJD. the molecular mass of glycans at the second site of PrPT183A seemed to be smaller than that of glycans on the second site of PrPF198S or brain PrPSc of sCJD. the glycans on the di-glycosylated PrPF198S were not cleaved by Endo H. the epitopes of V14, localized at sheep PrP188-199 corresponding to human PrP185-196, and V61, localized at sheep PrP169-174 corresponding to human PrP166-171 were mapped. however, the conventional peptide scanning failed to localize them on the PrP sequence. inability of V61 to detect PrP from cultured cells mainly resulted from its lower affinity for PrP. autophagy degrades organelles and unfolded proteins through the lysosomal pathway and has been considered a key adaptive response that can prevent death in stressed or diseased cells. iPrPC is involved in prion and Alzheimer diseases and in the long-term memory storage according to our recent findings [31-34]. new insights into mechanisms underlying the spontaneous formation of PrP aggregates obtained with cell models would be significant in enhancing our understanding of not only prion diseases but also other diseases involving protein misfolding. human neuroblastoma cells were transfected with the episomal vector CEP4. cells were grown as bulk selected hygromycin-resistant cultures at 37\u00b0C in OPTI-MEM with 5% calf serum supplement, iron-enriched (GIBCO-BRL) and 500 g/ml Hygromycin B. brain homogenates were prepared in 9 volumes of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris, 100 mM NaCl, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 10 mM EDTA, pH 7.4) for PK-digestion, samples were incubated with designated amounts of PK at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the reaction was terminated through the addition of PMSF at a final concentration of 3 mM and boiling in SDS sample buffer. the control membrane was probed only with HRP-conjugated sheep anti-mouse IgG. the g5p molecule (100 g) was conjugated to 7 x 108 tosyl activated magnetic beads in 1 ml of PBS at 37\u00b0C for 20 h. the g5p beads were stable for at least 3 months at 4\u00b0C. combinant PrP was boiled in equal volume of 2 X sample buffer. pellets were incubated with pre-chilled methanol for 2 h. pellets were resuspended in 20 l buffer and subjected to anti-PrP antibodies. embedding film (Electron Microscopy Sciences, Hatfield, PA) were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M millonigs\u2019 phosphate buffer (pH f.4) for two hours. cells were postfixed in ferrocyanide-reduced osmium tetroxide (Karnovsky, 1971) another rinse was followed by dehydration in ascending concentrations of ethanol. wild type cells were grown under identical conditions to those described above. they were also fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. the blocking step included PK (10 g/mL) for the PK positive dishes along with PBST. Peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) was purchased from New England Biolabs. reagents included Amino-PEG cellulose membranes and Fmoc-amino acids were obtained from Intavis. transfected cells were grown as bulk selected hygromycin-resistant cultures at 37\u00b0C in OPTI-MEM with 5% calf serum supplement, iron-enriched (GIBCO-BRL) and 500 g/ml Hygromycin B (Calbiochem, La Jolla, CA) for each experiment, cells were removed from the flask with trypsin, and counted. cell lysates were centrifuged at 1000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. pellet was resuspended in 100 l of lysis buffer. epitope mapping by peptide membrane arrays. the g5p beads were incubated with 0.1 % BSA in PBS. the beads were stable for at least 3 months at 4\u00b0C. the specific capture of PrPSc by g5p was performed. the samples were incubated with pre-chilled methanol and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. the pellets were resuspended in 20 l samples buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with various anti-PrP antibodies. transfected cells expressing PrPWt, PrPT183A, or PrPF198S were grown overnight on poly-d-lysine coated coverslips. cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 minutes at room temperature. blocking was performed with PBST (10% Goat Serum, 2% T-20, 1% Triton X-100) the proteins on the gels were transferred to Immobilon-P membrane (PVDF, Millipore) for 2 h at room temperature with either 3F4 (1:40,000), 1E4 (1:1,000), 6H4 (1:6,000), V14 (1:500), V61 (1:500), anti-N (1:6,000) or anti-C (1:10,000)"}
