{"summary": "extinction rates are thought to be 100- to 1000-times greater than past rates determined from the fossil record. anthropogenic changes to habitat are also contributing to a second biological crisis: an increase in the rate of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) a multi-disciplinary approach will be necessary to combat the crises of extinction and disease emergence because human, ecosystem and animal health are inextricably linked. a multi-disciplinary approach will be necessary to combat the crises of extinction and disease emergence because human, ecosystem and animal health are inextricably linked. molecular clock is derived from the hypothesis that sequence evolution occurs at stable rate such that the time since the divergence of two or more sequences can be estimated. Phylogeny The relations between a set of sequences showing which shares a most recent common ancestor with other sequences. population structure is defined by several key parameters including number of individuals in a population, age distribution of individuals, probabilities of survival (or mortality) and rates of fecundity. parasite population is not randomly distributed among hosts, such that the variance is greater than the mean. in the case of viruses and other microparasites, R0 is the average number of secondary infections which an infection produces. the roots of ecology date back to theophrastus in the 4th century B.C. disease ecologists have developed the study of parasites and pathogens in the wild. this knowledge has been synthesized into mathematical models which describe the dynamic properties of ecosystems and predict how parasites and pathogens flow through them. these models are becoming more commonly integrated into epidemiological studies that seek to predict outbreaks or periods of time when cross-species spillover risk is highest. the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) pandemic spread from the presumptive point of emergence in la Gloria Mexico to new Zealand in just under a month [32] while SARS radiated from Guangdong, China to 26 different countries within several months [29] wildlife conservationists have documented several mass mortality events in other animal species. globalization, host ecology, host-virus dynamics, climate change, and anthropogenic landscape changes all contribute to the complexity of zoonotic viral emergence and phylodynamics has far-reaching applications for the control of viruses in both human and animal populations. rooted molecular phylogeny represents the evolutionary relationships between individual viral sequences, as represented by circles. recombination may obscure \u2018true\u2019 relationships between viral sequences. coalescent theory provides the basis for many phylodynamic approaches. circles on the same row represent temporally simultaneous infections. lineages can be traced back to the most recent common ancestor (black circle) phylogeographic tools have also been applied by Walsh et al. (2005) [45] to locate the putative origin of the Zaire strain of Ebola virus. using a \u2018landscape genetics\u2019 approach may help identify geographical barriers to viral spread and help identify vulnerable human or wildlife populations. the ability to construct phylogenies is further limited by the total viral genetic information available. governments and industrial institutions may be reluctant to report sequences of economically important viruses. phylodynamics is currently encumbered by the aforementioned factors. research using helminths and bacteria has revealed patterns of ancient human migration and dispersal. there have been few attempts to utilize viruses to this end (save [60,61]) it is surprising that viruses have not been used more for the inference of host population biology since some of their characteristics make them ideal for doing so. most viruses have large population sizes and short generation times, and many replicate using a highly error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is known for high host specificity. it is thus far the only virus to have been used to elucidate changes in host population structure and size. a phylogenetic analysis of FIVpco inferred that the north american population of cougars became subdivided during the last century. researchers could monitor the use of wildlife corridors and the efficacy of control measures aimed at limiting the range of a host species. viruses with specific transmission routes may also serve as proxies for behaviors related to transmission (i.e., sexually transmitted diseases) viruses have large population sizes and short generation times. many replicate using a highly error-prone RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. viruses may provide information about host demographics on a shorter timescale than molecular markers of the host. feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) is known for high host specificity. it is the only virus to have been used to elucidate changes in host population structure and size. phylogenetic analysis of FIVpco inferred that the north american population of cougars became subdivided during the last century. viral discovery and metagenomics a major hurdle for virologists and ecologists is defining the biodiversity of life. the diversity of viruses known to infect the house mouse (Mus musculus), a staple in biomedical research, is not yet completely known. the paucity of information about viral diversity within a host poses problems for research progress. it is currently difficult to understand viral pathogenesis and transmission without completely understanding the dynamics of co-infections. a virus\u2019 actions, and even its ability to infect the host, could be a function of another (possibly undetected) co-habitant. Vaccines take several forms including live-attenuated viruses. inactivated whole viruses, inactivated toxins and viral protein subunits are often delivered in combination. new techniques are being developed with oral, aerosolized and nasal vaccines currently on the market. a caveat to this success is that there is growing evidence that vaccination against a specific strain of pathogen can result in inadvertent selection for related co-infecting strains. the possibility of inadvertent viral strain selection highlights the importance of understanding the long-term evolutionary and ecological consequences of vaccination. researchers have tested the efficacy of vaccinating american robins to interrupt the WNV transmission cycle. this species can absorb up to 75% of the potentially infective mosquito bites in early spring. this species is thus a key host in the WNV system. researchers have used satellite imagery to identify habitat characteristics that accurately predict the prevalence of Sin Nombre virus [107,108], a hantavirus that uses the Deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) as a reservoir host. this is especially the case for zoonotic viral pathogens where the reservoir hosts are known and a targeted approach is feasible. long-term monitoring and surveillance in reservoirs will also enlighten us to the kind of heterogeneities that exist through time and that and can be exploited with efficient vaccination campaigns. zoonoses are driven by anthropogenic activities such as land-use change, agricultural intensification, and driven by global travel and trade. advances in molecular virology and genetics have dramatically changed our ability to manage both conservation and health. this type of interdisciplinary approach considers free-ranging wildlife, domestic animals and humans as inextricable components of a single disease system."}
