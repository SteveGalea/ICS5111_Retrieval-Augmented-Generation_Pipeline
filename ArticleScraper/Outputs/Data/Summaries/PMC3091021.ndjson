{"summary": "despite their pervasiveness, viral infections are generally not considered to be of clinical significance among the critically ill, unless the patient is significantly immuncompromised. despite their pervasiveness, viral infections are generally not considered to be of clinical significance among the critically ill, unless the patient is significantly immuncompromised. patients with a primary or secondary ICD 9 code signifying a history of organ transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), autoimmune disease, leukemia, pancytopenia, or lymphoma were excluded. a total 209,695 patients met the study criteria. multivariate analysis was used to calculate the univariate and multivariate adjusted relative risks of each exposure group. the final multivariate regression included age, gender, race, and hospital cluster. adjusted for hospital cluster accounts for patient volume and prevents over or under representation by hospital size. patients with a primary or secondary ICD 9 code signifying a history of organ transplantation, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), autoimmune disease, leukemia, pancytopenia, or lymphoma were excluded. a total 209,695 patients met the study criteria. the final multivariate regression included age, gender, race, and hospital cluster. adjusted for hospital cluster accounts for patient volume and prevents over or under representation by hospital size. cident Infection Bacterial Infection p-values N = 190,386 N = 370 N = 18, 611 Gender Male 53.2% 52.4% 53.1% 53.9% 0.28 Female 46.8% 47.6% 46.9% 46.1% 0.28 Race White 68.8% 66.9% 65.1% 65.7% 0.0001 Black 15.3% 16.3% 15.3% 17.9% 0.0001 Hispanic 7.0% 8.9% 7.3% 6.6% 0.19 Asian 2.4% 2.7% the relative risk (RR) for each outcome according to infecting organism is shown in Table S2. the relative risk (RR) for each outcome according to risk group is shown in Table S2. Influenza alone was only associated with an increased risk of respiratory failure 3.19, 95% CI (1.96, 5.17) septic shock RR 122.2, 95% CI (33.9, 440.2) septic shock RR 122.2, 95% CI (33.9, 440.2) the AP and synergy index were significant at 0.28 95% CI (0.046, 0.45) and 1.39 95% CI (1.02, 1.88) respectively. a viral infection is associated with an increased risk of mortality, pneumonia, ARDS, respiratory failure, respiratory failure, diarrhea, MSOF, sepsis, and septic shock. studies have reported reactivation of CMV and HSV in up to 35% and 64% of critically ill patients. between 50% and 80% of the population is CMV-seropositive by age 40 years and 72% of the population aged 14\u201319 years is seropositive for HSV-1 and HSV-2 combined. van den Brink et al addressed the concept of viral reactivation as a marker. there is an independent association of death and MSOF among patients who develop both a viral and bacterial infection during their hospitalization. aphylococcus aureus pneumonia was encountered as well as an increased incidence of bacterial otitis media associated with both RSV and influenza virus. aphylococcus pneumonia was encountered as well as an increased incidence of bacterial otitis media associated with both. viral infections may down regulate the host immune response leading to subsequent bacterial infection. the denominator of active viral infection among the critically ill is not known. this is the only population based dataset that has documented viral infections among the critically ill. viral infections may play a very important role in the overall outcome of critically ill patients who were immunocompetent."}
