{"summary": "the optimal drug combination was determined and then divided into the different modules. we established a drug supply expedited system for \u2018traffic accidents, poisoning first aid, natural disasters, epidemics and mass disturbances\u2019. clinical pharmacists should take advantage of their professional expert knowledge and participate in emergency medical care. the primary types of diseases and conditions occurred during the following catastrophes and emergency events. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 and \u2018First Aid Module\u2019 were subdivided into \u2018General Module\u2019 and \u2018First Aid Module\u2019. \u2018Specific Modules\u2019 contained specific drugs used for particular disaster or injuries, such as vaccinations and medications used during floods. the proportion of drugs primarily used to treat certain category diseases could be determined. the total amount of drugs=the amount of drugs for 50 patients in Category 1 this class of drug indications disease incidence ratio (%) +. the amount of drugs for 50 patients in Category 2 this class of drug indications disease incidence ratio (%) +. the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) emphasised the role of pharmacists in emergencies. the primary types of diseases and conditions occurred during the following catastrophes and emergency events. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 drugs were classified as \u2018Universal Module\u2019 and \u2018Specific Modules\u2019. \u2018Universal Module\u2019 drugs could be used in all emergency incidents. \u2018First Aid Module\u2019 mainly included analgesics, haemostatics and anaesthesia agents. drug quantity=[(DDD)(medication days)(number of patients)]/drug specification. the proportion of drugs primarily used to treat certain category diseases could be determined. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 and \u2018First Aid Module\u2019 were classified as \u2018Universal Module\u2019 and \u2018Specific Modules\u2019. \u2018Specific Modules\u2019 contained specific drugs used for particular disaster or injuries, such as vaccinations and medications used during floods. \u2018Specific Modules\u2019 contained specific drugs used for particular disaster or injuries, such as vaccinations and medications used during floods. the drug quantities were estimated using the drug daily dose (DDD), the medication time, and the number of patients. so, the drug quantity=[(DDD)(medication days)(number of patients)]/drug specification. to reduce drug waste, we must also consider that the incidences of various diseases differ in different situations. therefore, we used statistical methods to determine the proportion of various diseases. arranged high-alert drugs and prohibited drugs for the special populations. then we set up a warning function in the emergency system. for example, when one selected a drug that should be prohibited or cautiously taken by pregnant women, a warning alert would pop up as a warning display on the computer screen. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 and \u2018Specific Modules\u2019 were established. the common (universal) module contained the drug that could be used in all emergency incidents. the specific (special) modules contained the specific drugs that are only used in a particular disaster. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 was divided into the \u2018General module\u2019 and the \u2018First aid module\u2019. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 was divided into the \u2018General module\u2019 and \u2018First aid module\u2019. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 was divided into

data derived from our hospital over recent years. with bodily injury as the primary treatment goal, we determined the composition ratio of injury types using the Decision Analysis method. the Delphi method determined six classes of poisoning events by the amount of drug supplies, which antidotes to use, and which treatments should be selected to prevent complications. the epidemic diseases module According to the drug information from our emergency rescue work, which was obtained during the SARS pandemic influenza prevention and control. s often result in the outbreak of basic diseases, respiratory diseases and infectious diseases, according to data from the 1996 floods in north china, the 1998 China Yangtze river and the Songhua river basin flood. we determined the composition of various diseases, as follows: cardiovascular diseases (10%), respiratory diseases (30%), gastrointestinal disorders (30%), skin inflammation (30%), ENT diseases (10%), bone diseases (10%), and other conditions (10%). the design was divided into two parts: the internal data and the operation interface design. the drugs were assembled according to the event type, and the drug quantity was calculated by the DDD, the composition ratio of diseases in the event, the medication time, and the number of patients. the drills confirmed that our emergency drug supply system was reasonable, adequate and timely. we established the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 (General Module and First-aid module) and \u2018Specific Modules\u2019 (traffic accidents, poisoning, natural disasters, epidemic disease, and other general emergencies) the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 was divided into the \u2018General module\u2019 and \u2018First aid module\u2019. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 was divided into the \u2018General module\u2019 and \u2018First aid module\u2019. the \u2018Universal Module\u2019 was divided into the \u2018General module\u2019 and \u2018First aid module\u2019.

(2) respiratory infection (20%); (3) gastrointestinal reactions; and (4) skin inflammation (40%). fire was a universal threat to public safety and social development. urbanisation has led to sustained increases in population density in some areas. human production and lifestyle changes have exposed populations to a greater risk of burns. first-aid emergency personnel entered the basic information into the system. the total number of people (50, including critically ill patients,10 people and children5) and the days of hospitalisation (3 days) a list with the number of drugs was immediately generated. the pharmacy also receives a list of drugs that should be equipped for the timely deployment in case of medicine shortages. ill patients, 10 people and children5) and the days of hospitalisation (3 days). a list with the number of drugs was immediately generated, where special populations such as drug use and high-risk drugs precautions instantly alert. the pharmacy also receives a list of drugs that should be equipped for the timely deployment. the information technology platform was an effective model of a hospital's emergency medicine supply. however, the current selection of medicines in emergency care lacks the preparation of a scientific catalogue and effective communication of information, which primarily come from experienced judgment. values for emergency first-aid first-aid."}
