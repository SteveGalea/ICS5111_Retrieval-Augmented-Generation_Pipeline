{"summary": "different immune-based assays have been reported for the detection and quantification of Ebola virus (EBOV) proteins. however, the currently available platforms for design and production of full-length mAbs are cumbersome and costly. the use of antibody fragments, rather than full-length antibodies, might represent a cost-effective alternative for the development of diagnostic and possibly even therapeutic alternatives for EBOV. antibody fragments present several potential advantages over the use of full-length mAbs [12] to produce 1 g of a mAb in a bacterial system would cost between 1/10 to 1/100 of the cost of producing 1 g of a full length mAb in a bacterial system. mAb fragment should be as effective as a full length mAb in terms of molecular affinity for an ex-vivo diagnostic application. the use of an optimized mAb implies 6X higher binding efficacy per unit of mass. mAb 13C6 is one of the three full-length mAbs contained in M\u2013003. mAb KZ52, mAb 13C6, and mAb 13F6 named after their full-length counterparts. all three fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli and produced using fed-batch culture protocols in instrumented 2.0L reactors. the full-length mAbs, 13C6, 13F6, and KZ52, have been widely studied in previous literature. each monomer is composed of a GP1 subunit (yellow ovals) and a GP2 subunit (orange stalk) GSGTDFTLTISNMQSEDLADYFCQQYSSYPLTFGAGTKLELRRADAAPTVSIFPPSSGGGGGGSQLTLKESGPGILKPSQTLSLTCSLSGFSLSTSGVGWFRQPSGKGLEWLALIWWDDDKYYNPSLKSQLSISKDFSRNQVFLKISNVDIADTATYYCARRDPFGYDNAMGYWGQGTSVTVS SAKTTAPPVYPLVPGSL the presence of protein was confirmed with SDS-PAGE and anti-HisTag western blotting. the presence of protein was confirmed with SDS-PAGE and anti-HisTag western blotting. anti-body fragments (scFv-13C6) were recovered by immobilized metal-affinity chromatography (IMAC) with 1 mL His Trap FF column pre-charged with Ni2+. the peak at 100\u2013110 mL of volume corresponds to fragment scFv-13C6. the first cycle was set at 5,000 psi; the following two cycles were performed at 20,000 psi. the pellet was resuspended in inclusion bodies IB wash buffer (20 mM PBS, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, 2 M urea. the target protein was eluted with 10 CV of elution buffer (20 mM PBS, 500 mM NaCl, 350 mM imidazole, pH 8.2) the target protein was eluted with 10 CV of elution buffer (20 mM PBS, 500 mM NaCl, 350 mM imidazole, pH 8.2) mAb 13F6 (Integrated Biotherapeutics Bioservices; Gaithersburg, MD USA) and Infliximab (a commercial anti-rheumatoid arthritis therapeutic mAb from Janssen Biotech; Horsham, PA USA) were dispensed into different wells, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and washed twice with 0.05% PBS-Tween solution. Symbols for mAb fragments are the same as those presented in Fig 1. Error bars indicate standard deviation from four repeats of independent ELISA experiments. 100 L of either a 1 or 5 g/mL solution of anti-Histidine Tag IgG was dispensed into each well, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and washed twice with 0.05% PBS-Tween solution. binding of antibody fragments to GP was evaluated in ELISA experiments. rGP (yellow oval with orange stalk) was attached to assay surfaces treated with anti-histidine IgGs (grey Ys marked with a fluorescent star) in these experiments, the binding between GP and the fragments was revealed using a solution of poly-clonal anti-histidine IgGs. solutions were prepared in 0.05% PBS-Tween solution at dilution 1:120000 and 1:75000 respectively. samples and revealing solutions were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. then washed three times with a solution of anti-Polyhistidine IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. anti-GP full-length mAbs, 13C6, 13F6, and KZ52, have been widely studied in previous literature. each monomer is composed of three monomers. each monomer is composed of a GP1 subunit (yellow ovals) and a GP2 subunit (orange stalk) mHHHHDDDDKDIVMTQSQKFMSTSVGDRVSLTCKASQNVGTAVAWYQQQKPGQSPKLLIYSASNRYTGVPDRFTGSGSGTDFTLTISNMQSEDLADYFCQQQYSSYPLTFGAGTKLELRRADAAPTVSIFPPSSGGGGGGSGGGSQLTLKESGPGILKPSQTLSLTCSLSGFSLSTSGVGWFRQPSGKGLEWL the culture conditions were pH = 7.2, 37\u00b0C and 400 RPM during growth phase. the culture conditions were pH = 7.2, 37\u00b0C and 400 RPM. protein production was induced using 1mM isopropyl thiogalactoside (IPTG) approximately 4 hours after initiation of the process. the presence of protein was confirmed with SDS-PAGE and anti-HisTag western blotting. cell lysates were centrifuged in inclusion bodies IB wash buffer (20 mM PBS, 500 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, 2% v/v Triton X\u2013100, pH 7.4) pellet was resuspended in inclusion bodies IB wash buffer (20 mM PBS, 500 mM NaCl, 6 M urea, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM imidazole, the target protein was eluted with 10 CV of elution buffer (20 mM PBS, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.2) the target protein was eluted with 10 CV of elution buffer (20 mM PBS, 500 mM NaCl, 350 mM imidazole, pH 8.2) rGP expressed in insect cells were dispensed into each well, incubated for 12 h at 4\u00b0C, and washed twice with 0.05% PBS-Tween solution. 200 L of commercial blocking solution (Pierce; Rockford, IL USA) were dispensed per well, incubated at ambient temperature for 30 minutes, and then washed twice with 0.05% PBS-Tween solution. negative controls consisted of surfaces with GP or HA-RBD not exposed to anti-GP fragments. Symbols for mAb fragments are the same as those presented in Fig 1. GP (or HA) binding affinities of two full-length monoclonal antibodies (mAb 13F6) and antibody fragment Fab-KZ52 were evaluated. 100 L of a 1.0 g/mL solution of each mAb or mAb fragment were dispensed into different wells, incubated for 1 h at room temperature, and washed three times with 0.05% PBS-Tween solution. the mAb complexes were revealed by adding 100 L per well of a solution of an anti-human IgG-Fc marked with horseradish peroxidase (Pierce; Rockford, IL USA) the mAb fragments were revealed by adding a solution of anti-Polyhistidine IgG horseradish peroxidase conjugate. scFvs are the smallest stable antibody fragments capable of specifically binding an antigen. they are composed of an antibody variable light-chain amino acid sequence (VL) linked to a variable heavy-chain sequence (VH) by a designed peptide (of 10 to about 25 amino acids) each mAb fragment was recovered and purified using the protocols described in the Materials and Methods. an overall yield of 5\u201310 mg/L (mg of antibody fragment per L of culture media in the reactor) can be obtained by this non-optimized process with a final product purity higher than 98%. a layer of anti-histidine IgGs was first dispensed on the surface of assay wells for later attachment of an rGP layer (yellow ovals with orange stalks) the presence of the mAb fragment+GP complexes was revealed by the addition of a solution of anti-igG polyclonal-IgGs (grey Ys with black variable regions and green fluorescent stars) IgG solution (1 or 5 g/mL) used to treat the assay surface. errors indicate standard deviation from at least two repeats of independent ELISA experiments. no normalization has been performed. the Fab-KZ52 epitope is less exposed than the scFv-13C6 or scFv-13F6. the fab-KZ52 epitope is less exposed than the scFv-13C6 or scFv-13F6. the proper alignment of GP molecules could favor the access of antibodies to it. v-13C6 and scFv-13F6 decreased. on average, the apparent scFv-13F6 GP binding affinity decreased 30.20%(10.69%) and the apparent scFv-13C6 GP binding affinity decreased by 41.34%(6.54)% (from 19.08(1.750) to 11.12(0.938) normalized units) the Fab-KZ52 selectivity was measured as the ratio of the absorbance signals between GP and HA-RBD binding assays. the binding activity of Fab-KZ52 to GP was evaluated in ELISA experiments. the binding activity of Fab-KZ52 to GP was evaluated in a similar manner. the ratio of absorbance signals due to GP&mAb-13F6 and GP&Fab-KZ52 binding was 2.00(0.161) and 3.187(0.269) in experiments using 1 and 5 g/mL of anti-histidine IgG coating solution. these results are provided only as a reference to indicate the level of sensitivity expected when using an anti-GP(EBOV) fragment instead of a commercially available full-length mAb. scFv-13C6 and scFv-13F6 proteins are single-chain variable fragments. the scFvs are the smallest stable antibody fragments capable of specifically binding an antigen. Fab-KZ52 was not strictly designed as an scFV. the maximum biomass concentration in non-optimized batch cultures was 6\u20138 g/L. the product concentration after 18 h of culture was estimated at 20\u201380 mg/L. each mAb fragment was recovered and purified using the protocols described in the Materials and Methods. binding activity of mAb-13F6, Fab-KZ52, scFv-13F6, scFv-13C6 to GP was evaluated in ELISA experiments. a layer of anti-histidine IgGs (grey Ys) was first dispensed on the surface of assay wells for later attachment of an rGP layer (yellow ovals with orange stalks) the presence of the mAb+GP complex was revealed by the addition mAbs-13F6 (black mAb with green variable regions), Fab-KZ52 (burgundy fragment), scFv-13F6 (green fragment), and scFv-13C6 (blue fragment) to GP (yellow ovals with orange stalks) id protein, HA-RBD from Influenza A/H1N1/2009, was attached to the assay surface instead of GP. the ratio of GP-binding affinity to GP/HA was 3.91(0.468), 4.48(0.439) and 5.00(0.455) for Fab-KZ52, scFV-13F6 and scFv-13C6 respectively. a probable explanation for this could be the nature of the KZ52 epitop Fab-KZ52 experiments were achieved using an anti-histidine IgG layer. the average GP binding affinity increased 65.00%(29.94%). on average, the apparent scFv-13F6 GP binding affinity decreased 30.20%(10.69%) and the apparent scFv-13C6 GP binding affinity decreased by 41.34%(6.54)%. ratio of absorbance signals between positive samples (Fab-KZ52 + GP) and negative controls was 13.86(1.053) and 9.03(0.337) units, respectively, in assays with surfaces treated with 1 and 5 g/mL of anti-histidine IgGs. this ratio increased to 16.61(2.674) units in assays conducted on surfaces treated with 0.5 g/mL of anti-histidine IgGs. each panel shows results from experiments conducted at two different concentrations of the anti-histidine IgG solution. Symbols for mAb fragments are the same as those presented in Fig 1. Error bars indicate standard deviation from four repeats of independent ELISA experiments. horizontal black lines indicate significant differences between groups (***p0.001). three mAb fragments are able to bind a commercially available GP with comparable affinity (lower but in same order of magnitude) to that seen with the previously studied and now commercially available full length anti-GP mAbs. the use of antibody fragments rather than full length antibodies will significantly reduce the cost of production of Ebola diagnostic devices. deriving functional mAb fragments from well-studied full length mAbs might be a cost-effective (and expeditious) strategy for reacting to diagnostic needs in epidemic (or even pandemic) events."}
