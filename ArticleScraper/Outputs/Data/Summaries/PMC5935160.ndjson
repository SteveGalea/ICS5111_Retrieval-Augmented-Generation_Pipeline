{"summary": "global health investment is a key economic opportunity for decades to come. private sector funders need to see financial return linked to capital providers. health considerations directly impact profitability of the firm and therefore should be incorporated into financial analysis. health constitutes a major economic force in high-income countries and emerging economies alike. in 2013, total global health expenditure amounted to $7.28 trillion. india is expected to reach almost $200 billion in health expenditures in 2018. debate on the SDGs has triggered reinforced efforts to define the role of private sector investment, and its impact on development goals. iii Global policy leaders show unprecedented willingness to break down silos. global health investment opportunity Under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), countries have set themselves an ambitious health policy agenda for the next 15 years. in 2013, total global health expenditure amounted to $7.28 trillion. in germany, the health sector constituted 11.2% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2013 growing at 3.5% per annum. financial development contributes to economic growth, supports innovation and facilitates entrepreneurship iv. functionally financial institutions provide credit for investments, liquidity for bridging financial gaps of individuals or companies and risk management services by pooling risks. economic hardship and spending cuts have significant effects on health systems and population health. rising unemployment brings a higher rate of psychological illness, and a higher suicide rate. in the u.s., the share of adults reporting serious psychological distress increased substantially since 2007. the international Monetary Fund estimates that GDP fell by 23.9% in 2015 compared with the previous year viii. health crises can severely damage economic systems and have an ongoing negative impact on economic growth and cross-border trade. the burst real estate bubble in the USA left governments the only actors able to restore trust. health fell as a share of total government spending in many countries. increased user charges reduced equity and efficiency of the systems. such spending cuts impact the long-term health of a country. investments include $3 billion annually on improving surgical capacity, $1.5 billion annually to expand tuberculosis training, $1 billion annually to expand immunisation coverage of children, and many more. for TB, preventive treatment costing $8 billion every year would deliver a $359 billion benefit through extended productive lifetimes by 20 years. total healthcare spending in emerging economies is projected to rise by an average rate of around 10% until 2022 (developed economies: approximately 4% per annum (see figure 3)) total healthcare spending in emerging countries is projected to rise by an average rate of around 10% until 2022. developed countries are only 22%.5 Figure 4. Composition of external sources of development finance, 2012. xi other health areas\u2014often the more fundamental ones\u2014have been neglected so far. between 2000 and 2013, 71% went to the pharmaceuticals sector. hospitals and diagnostic centres only received 21% of the FDI equity inflows. other investment institutions may require greater trading liquidity in collective structures. the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalisation index. it represents about 13% of the world market capitalisation. global health spending reached $7.28 trillion in 2013 and is projected to reach $9.3 trillion by 2018. a key question is how these investments can be channelled into the considerable unfulfilled funding needs of projects supporting health-related SDGs. external development finance in 2012 shows a bias away from the least developed countries. evidence from India showed that a major share of total equity FDI into the healthcare sector ended up in pharmaceuticals. xi other health areas\u2014often the more fundamental ones\u2014have been neglected so far. the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is a free float-adjusted market capitalisation index. it represents about 13% of the world market capitalisation. global health spending reached $7.28 trillion in 2013 and is projected to reach $9.3 trillion by 2018. a key question is how these investments can be channelled into the considerable unfulfilled funding needs of projects supporting health-related SDGs. a key question is how these investments can be channelled into the considerable unfulfilled funding needs of health-related projects. xi other health areas have been neglected so far. a bias also exists at sectoral level. a bias also exists at sectoral level. high growth areas would include countries such as south africa, china, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and Saudi Arabia. premiums in emerging markets will grow from $1 trillion in 2013 to $1.48 trillion in 2020 driven in particular by emerging Asia and the Middle East. tobacco kills around 6 million people every year and in 2030, 80% of deaths due to tobacco will come from low/middle-income countries. over the next 20 years, NCDs such as cancer, heart disease and stroke will cost more than US$30 trillion, representing 48% of global GDP in 2010. the push towards more responsible business strategies is a crucial element in harnessing banks as true partner for better health. there needs to be ongoing influence from policymakers and the public to drive this into every day practice. high growth areas would include countries such as south africa, china, Mexico, Turkey, Brazil, Russia and Saudi Arabia. despite more people in emerging economies accessing state-funded healthcare in recent years, the share of what people spent on healthcare from their disposable income is stable. over the past 20 years, the average annual growth rate of the consumed volume of soft drinks in low/middle-income countries was over 5%. between 1960 and 2000, the consumption of cigarettes rose at an annual rate of 4%. tobacco kills around 6 million people every year and in 2030, 80% of the deaths due to tobacco will come from low/middle-income countries. the push towards more responsible business strategies is a crucial element in harnessing banks as true partner for better health. the push towards more responsible business strategies is a crucial element in harnessing banks as true partner for better health. banks serve a growing group of investors who request a say in which sectors their money is invested. clients increasingly challenge whether investments into treatment, for example, pharmaceuticals, rather than prevention of the rising burden of lifestyle diseases in emerging economies actually contribute to improved health status. the push towards more responsible business strategies is a crucial element in harnessing banks as true partner for better health. the global movement for sustainable capital markets fosters collaboration between investors, regulators and companies. health could be included as a criterion of how well the company looks after its own employees\u2019 health. positive contributions can become a value-enhancing competitive advantage and investment criterion. an ESG+H framework could bring this to the mainstream."}
