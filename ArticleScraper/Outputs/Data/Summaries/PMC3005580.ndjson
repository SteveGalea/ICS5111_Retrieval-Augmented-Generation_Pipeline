{"summary": "the purpose of the IHR is to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease. the purpose of the IHR is to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are proportionate with and restricted to public health risks. there have been efforts to enhance laboratory capacity in many sub-saharan countries over the past five years. a recent review by Olmsted et al (2010) suggests a general improvement in infrastructure and service provision. there is no or limited distribution of available national laboratory guidelines and a lack of internal and external quality assurance systems. the field has been short of leadership since laboratory staff are rarely included in the decision-making process of health service planning. since 1993, founding member countries have been running a graduate-level program in public health, the Field Epidemiology Training Program (FETP) residents spend 65-75% of this time in field placement. this is a two year program with residents spending 65-75% of this time in field placement. this is a two year program with residents spending 65-75% of this time in field placement. short course curricula are available as open resources. over 500 field staff have been trained in these short courses. the short course curricula are available as open resources. this approach is expensive, time-consuming and logistically challenging in decentralized settings [13]. Traditionally, HIV external quality assurance programs use liquid serum or plasma specimens that require special cold storage and transportation conditions. the biohazard risks and costs of this approach have resulted in consistent quality assurance is generally lacking in lower-tier laboratories. basic laboratory information systems (BLIS) is an easy-to-use software that can be used as an effective alternative to paper-based approaches to enhance laboratory data management. laboratory data is often captured in multiple reports and may be inaccurate, non-standardized and illegible. the unit\u2019s mission is to promote public health net working and cross-border collaborations between sub-national, national, regional and inter national public health laboratories and laboratorians. this will enhance laboratory capacity by reducing the isolation of peripheral laboratories and enabling them to access network resources. AFENET has provided technical assistance by conducting baseline assessments and trainings in Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Swaziland. to garner support for this effort, AFENET collaborated with the WHO, CDC, and the Ugandan Ministry of Health. over 40 public health experts, including officials from the health ministries of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Ethiopia met in July 2010 in Kampala. six participants, two from each country, from each country, went through the rigorous practical training in calibration and maintenance of pipettes, microscopes, heating blocks, autoclaves, microplate washers and readers. there is a great need to support these seed staff so they can scale up this training and acquire standardized calibration tools for these countries. for years, there has been a lack of advanced-level training programs for laboratory scientists. this has contributed to the poor state of the laboratory sector in the region. the field has been short of leadership since laboratory staff are rarely included in the decision-making process of health service planning. so far, 75 trainees have been enrolled and 20 have graduated from the Laboratory Track in the six FELTPs. these are the first advanced-level training programs focusing on public health laboratories, combining technical, managerial and leadership skills. the short course curricula are available as open resources. over 500 field staff have been trained in these short courses. the short course curricula are available as open resources. in 2009, afenet began a pilot project using the recently developed dried tube specimen (DTS) Proficiency Testing panels. this approach addressed a number of the technical and logistical challenges of re-testing. the project supports the mailing costs, data entry and laboratory scientists to provide technical backup. basic laboratory information systems (BLIS) project aims to identify cost-effective ways of designing and implementing EQA systems. laboratory data is often captured in multiple reports and may be inaccurate, non-standardized and illegible. laboratory sites implementing BLIS receive an initial evaluation prior to installation of the software. collaborations between sub-national, national, regional and inter national public health laboratories and laboratorians for information sharing, technical support, training and other capacity building programs. we believe that this will enhance laboratory capacity by reducing the isolation of peripheral laboratories and enabling them to access network resources. AFENET has provided technical assistance by conducting baseline assessments and trainings in Rwanda, Zimbabwe and Swaziland. to garner support for this effort, AFENET collaborated with the WHO, CDC, and the Ugandan Ministry of Health to organize a workshop. over 40 public health experts, including officials from the health ministries of Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, and Ethiopia met in July 2010. six participants, two from each country, went through the rigorous practical training in calibration and maintenance of pipettes, microscopes, heating blocks, autoclaves, vortex stirrer, centrifuges, refrigerators and freezers. there is a great need to support seed staff so they can scale up this training and acquire standardized calibration tools for these countries. limited appreciation of the laboratory as a priority area slows down the buy-in for various initiatives by national authorities. available funding has so far enabled AFENET to develop and demonstrate effective approaches. but most of these programs have yet to be implemented. AFENET\u2019s vision is that every country in the region should have its own FELTP and enhance peripheral personnel skills through short course training. the SLMTA process is also an opportunity to support more laboratories towards accreditation. gaps still exist in biosecurity and biosafetly. authors\u2019 contributions MMM contributed towards conceptualization, data collection, drafting and revising the article it for important intellectual content. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
