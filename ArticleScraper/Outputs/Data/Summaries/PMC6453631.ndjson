{"summary": "in the u.s. alone, just over a quarter of hospital admissions involve ICU care. a rising majority of ICU patients survive their hospitalization. post-intensive care syndrome (PICS) has widespread consequences after hospital discharge. ICU-acquired weakness (ICUAW) is common among critically ill patients. it is associated with increased mortality, decreased ICU-free days, and a need for additional care after discharge. 109 survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) had persistent exercise limitations. a study of 275 medical ICU survivors found the prevalence of neurocognitive dysfunction to be 33% at 6 months post-discharge [20], and a more recent prospective study of 2929 elderly patients without dementia found the prevalence of neurocognitive dysfunction to be 33% at 6 months post-discharge [19]. a number of studies have examined both in-hospital and post-discharge interventions to combat PICS morbidity. ICU patients receiving MV 72 hours Early exercise and mobilization via PT and OT during daily interruption of sedation while in ICU Standard care Independent functional status (ability to perform 6 ADLs) at hospital discharge 59% of intervention group vs 35% of control group reached primary outcome. 2016 291 ICU survivors (84% received MV) multimodal program involving post-ICU training for patients on sepsis sequelae. outpatient patient monitoring by case managers via telephone for 12 months post-discharge. 240 patients who were discharged from a single-ICU in Scotland were randomized to receive multimodal therapy (physical, occupation, speech and language, and nutrition) the usual care group still received similar therapies, albeit at a decreased frequency (two- to threefold) the 2016 PRaCTICaL trial assessed an intervention that spanned both in-hospital and post-discharge locations. at 6 and 12 months after discharge, similar percentages of patients had returned to work, and there were not differences in satisfaction rates between groups. no difference between groups at 6 months post-discharge in quality of life related to mental health. only significant findings were increased measures of functional outcomes in the intervention group. post-ICU clinics are an alternative to the largely therapy-based interventions outlined above. a centralized post-ICU clinical model has conceptual advantages, but there are inherent barriers to their implementation. despite multiple interventional studies addressing PICS, there have been no findings that show a substantial benefit to post-ICU care. there are important differences between the two groups that may affect post-discharge needs. there is a severe shortage of intensivists in the u.s., and therefore utilizing intensivists in post-ICU clinics can be difficult. outpatient PCPs are an alternative staffing option; however, these providers have less experience and training with critically ill patients. it is unclear how to appropriately integrate post-ICU care with usual PCP visits. post-Intensive Care syndrome Up to two-thirds of survivors of critical illness face long-term problems as a result of their acute illness, the associated therapies, and their pre-existing chronic conditions. these problems include physical, cognitive, and mental impairments that have collectively been termed PICS. study evaluating long-term outcomes of 109 survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) found patients had persistent exercise limitations and reduced physical quality of life. the 6-minute walk distances were limited by weakness and muscle wasting, foot drop, dyspnea, and immobility of large joints. a study of 275 medical ICU survivors found the prevalence of neurocognitive dysfunction to be 33% at 6 months post-discharge. a more recent prospective study of 2929 elderly patients without dementia found that critical illness hospitalization was associated with greater cognitive decline. notably, cognitive dysfunction is often not assessed during hospital follow up. 35% of control group reached primary outcome (p=0.02; odds ratio 2.7) Intensive daily exercise in the ICU and hospital ward followed by biweekly exercise in the outpatient setting for 8 weeks Standard care 6MWT at 12 months No significant difference REVIVE trial. also involved individual goal setting and care coordination/delivery by a dedicated rehabilitation practitioner Standard care Rivermead Mobility Index at 3 months No significant difference REVIVE trial. 104 patients from two medical ICUs at university of Chicago and university of Iowa were randomized to receive early therapy versus standard of care. patients randomized to the intervention arm began their therapy on day 1.5 of their hospitalization versus after 7.4 days in the control group. the 2016 RECOVER trial focused on therapy provided during patients\u2019 post-ICU acute hospital stay. 240 patients who were discharged from a single-ICU in Scotland were randomized to receive multimodal therapy versus usual care. the usual care group still received similar therapies, albeit at a decreased frequency (two- to threefold) the 2016 SMOOTH trial evaluated a primary care intervention on mental health outcomes of ICU sepsis survivors from nine German ICUs. the study involved 291 patients who were randomized to receive post-discharge teaching by a case manager on sepsis sequelae versus usual care. post-ICU clinics are an alternative to the largely therapy-based interventions outlined above. they include recognition and treatment of patient comorbidities, medication reconciliation, promotion of financial resources, and functional and psychological rehabilitation. post-ICU clinics have been most notably utilized in the united kingdom. there are important differences between the two groups that may affect post-discharge needs. there are no studies demonstrating a direct financial benefit to the clinics. post-ICU clinics could become cost beneficial if they could prevent readmissions. post-ICU impairments often began pre-ICU admission, and delaying regular primary care visits for a specific ICU follow up visit may delay or complicate management of a patient\u2019s chronic, pre-ICU illness. a PCP who will follow the patient longitudinally may be better suited to organize this care. ICU care success is based on patient survival to floor transfer and hospital discharge. it is clear that ICU survivors experience far-reaching negative health consequences that can persist long after discharge."}
