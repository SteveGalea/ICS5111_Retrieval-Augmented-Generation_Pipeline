{"summary": "introduction Kawasaki disease (KD) most commonly develops in infants. the specific cause of KD is still unclear, but some reports suggest that it is triggered by bacterial or viral infections. a 37-year-old, previously healthy man was admitted to our hospital 12 days after developing a fever of 38\u00b0C and erythema of the hands, arms, and legs. he was treated with 300 mg/day of cefcapene-pivoxil and 60 mg/day of loxoprofen, but his condition did not improve. he was eventually referred to our hospital for close examination and treatment. atous erythema was noted on his trunk, extremities, axillae, flank, and hip. there was also brawny edema of the hands and feet and marked congestion of the conjunctivae. his lips were reddish, dry, and swollen, and his palatine tonsils were slightly red. myalgia, congested conjunctivae, erythema, and desquamations were resolved. the treatment was switched from aspirin to 200 mg/day of cilostazol. transthoracic echocardiography revealed no coronary aneurysms.

IVIG can mitigate inflammation and the coronary artery complications. a dose of 2 g/kg of IVIG in a single infusion has been found to be effective. this therapy should be initiated within the first 10 days of illness. adult-onset KD is rare, and this is a very rare case of KD and concurrent Coxsackievirus A4 infection. the annual incidence is 67 cases per 100,000 children in japan and 5.6 cases per 100,000 children in the united states. etiology The etiology of KD remains unclear, although the clinical features suggest that a viral or bacterial infection may be a trigger. the reason why only some patients infected with these viruses develop KD is unknown. coxsackievirus (types A2\u2013A5, B1\u2013B4), adenovirus (types 2\u20134), echovirus (types 1, 3, 5, 7), herpes simplex virus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, and human parvovirus. we analyzed serum samples taken on days 5, 13, and 32 of illness for antibody titers of coxsackievirus, adenovirus, and IVIG can mitigate inflammation and the coronary artery complications. a dose of 2 g/kg of IVIG in a single infusion has been found to be effective. this therapy should be initiated within the first 10 days of illness. the treatment for adult-onset KD should be the same as in infants. this rare case suggests that the disease can be concurrent Coxsackievirus A4 infection."}
