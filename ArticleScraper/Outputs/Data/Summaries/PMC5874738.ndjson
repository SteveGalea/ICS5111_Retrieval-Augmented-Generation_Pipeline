{"summary": "bovine herpesvirus 1 (BoHV-1), bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 (BVDV-1), bovine respiratory syncytial virus and bovine parainfluenza 3 virus have been associated with an increased risk of BRD. BVDV-1 is the most genetically diverse with 21 subgenotypes, BVDV-1a to BVDV-1u, having been reported. the overall biological importance of the BVDV-1 subgenotypes remains to be fully elucidated. it is reasonable to accept that the subgenotypes of BVDV-1 share similar properties with respect to their capacity to infect susceptible ruminants. all of these outcomes are reported in cattle populations regardless of what subgenotype is present. animals were infected with different strains of bovine viral diarrhoea virus 1 genotype 1c (BVDV-1c) on day 0 there were extra staff and equipment present while the cattle were being inoculated. the temperature increase was gradual from Day 6 to Day 9 post infection. fected with BVDV-1c strain AO554 (n = 4) showed elevated mean temperatures on day 7 and day 8 post infection. a similar temperature profile was observed for BVDV-1c strain NS155 (n = 4), with only the day 8 being statistically significant. the rectal temperatures of the contact animals (n = 2) did not exceed 39.0 \u00b0C during the experiment. swabs (N) and serum (S) samples were analysed using qPCR. swabs (N) and serum (S) samples were deemed positive for BVDV-1c. samples which did not react (>40) with the qPCR were deemed negative. 554 3 2666 4 35.3 34.3 33.6 32.0 32.0 36.3 2668 34.8 39.5 33.8 32.4 35.7 37.3 2669 4 36.6 37.1 32.0 31.6 33.7 32.6 37.5 2673 37.0 37.3 39.8 35.9 37.4 NS155 3 2667 2672 2674 38.4 2680 34.3 36.5 34.6 39.0 VR1112 3 2662 2678 36.8 38.8 2683 39.5 Contact 2 2663 2681 1 the BVDV-1c strain AO554 was the virus most consistently detected in the nasal swabs with all infected animals reacting with the qPCR at Day 6 and Day 7 post-infection. three of the four animals also reacted in the qPCR on Day 8. BVDV-1c was not detected via qPCR in the nasal swab or serum samples collected from all animals on Day 21, Day 28, Day 42 and Day 55 post-infection. no BVDV-1c was detected in any of the culture supernatants by qPCR after three passages of animal 2684 (PI506 infected and tested positive from Day 2 to Day 7), animal 2686 (Trangie infected), animal 2666 (AO554 infected) or animal animals infected with BVDV-1c strain PI506 (n = 6); animals infected with BVDV-1c strain Trangie (n = 4); animals infected with BVDV-1c strain AO554 (n = 4); animals infected with BVDV-1c strain VR1112 (n = 3); animals infected with BVDV-1c strain VR1112 (n = 3); animals infected with BVDV-1c strain VR1112 (n a recurrence of the significant reduction in the concentration of lymphocytes was detected on day 55 post-infection in cattle infected with strains PI506 (p 0.05, Figure 3a), AO554 (p 0.05, Figure 3c) and NS155 (p 0.05, Figure 3d) the group of animals infected with BVDV-1c strain PI506 had a significantly higher concentration of neutrophils compared to the Day 0 samples. the group of animals infected with BVDV-1c strain PI506 had significantly reduced eosinophil concentrations on day 42. the uninfected control animals consistently had the lowest concentration of eosinophils on all sampling days. the uninfected control animals consistently had the lowest concentration of eosinophils on all sampling days. the only significant reduction was for the animals infected with BVDV-1c strain NS155 on Day 14. a reduction in platelet numbers was also apparent on Day 14 for animals infected with strain PI506, Trangie and VR1112. the concentration of platelets in cattle infected with BVDV-1c strain AO554 appeared stable for the duration of the experiment. 18 of the 21 animals infected with strains Trangie or AO554 had detectable BVDV-1 specific antibody by day 28 post-infection. one of the animals infected with strain AO554 was positive on Day 14 but subsequently tested negative on Day 21. clinical assessments No overt clinical scores were recorded for any of the trial animals, challenged or unchallenged with the BVDV-1c strains used in this study. a general trend for an increase in the average rectal temperature on Day 0 of the experiment, prior to any viral exposure, compared to the temperatures from Day 1 to Day 5. the reason(s) for this increase are unclear. asterisks above selected days indicate significant differences compared to day 1 post-infection for cattle. animals (n = 6) infected with BVDV-1c strain PI506 exhibited a significant temperature elevation on Day 8 post infection. a similar temperature profile was observed for BVDV-1c strain NS155 (n = 4), with elevated temperatures on Day 8 and Day 9. the rectal temperatures of the contact animals (n = 2) did not exceed 39.0 \u00b0C during the experiment. no statistical comparisons were undertaken for this group due the low animal numbers. the qPCR was deemed negative for the virus. the qPCR was deemed negative. 3 Animals housed together in Containment Room 1. 4 Virus isolation experiments using the. the BVDV-1c strain AO554 was the virus most consistently detected in the nasal swabs with all infected animals reacting with the qPCR at Day 6 and Day 7 post-infection. three of the four animals also reacted in the qPCR on Day 8. no BVDV-1c was detected in any of the culture supernatants by qPCR after three passages of Animal 2684 (PI506 infected and tested positive from Day 2 to Day 7), Animal 2686 (Trangie infected), Animal 2666 (AO554 infected) or Animal 2669 (AO554 infected) at Day 14 post-infection the levels of WBC had returned to similar levels to those observed on the day of infection for all animals. animals infected with BVDV-1c strain NS155 (n = 4); animals infected with BVDV-1c strain VR1112 (n = 3); animals infected with BVDV-1c strain VR1112 (n = 3); uninfected animals (n = 2).
