{"summary": "the pigeon circovirus (PiCV) is thought to be one of the causative factors of the greatest health problem in global pigeon breeding. piCV infections are spread worldwide due to the specificity of pigeon breeding [3] like, e.g., inability to follow biosecurity procedures, especially in case of racing birds. a combination of conditionally pathogenic microorganisms is required for disease manifestation. the type and intensity of clinical symptoms are correlated with the type of confounding factor. infections caused by another immunosuppresive virus from the Circoviridae family were noted. the genome of PiCV has an ambisense organization, with two major open reading frames (ORFs). ORF V1, which is located on the virion sense strand and encodes replicase (Rep protein), and ORF C1, which is located on the complementary sense strand and encodes the viral capsid protein. CP is the main constituent of circoviral capsids, but plays an intermediate role in viral DNA penetration into the cell nucleus of the host. pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein (rCP) is immunogenic to pigeons. pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein (rCP) is immunogenic to pigeons. pigeon circovirus recombinant capsid protein (rCP) is immunogenic to pigeons. cloacal swabs and blood samples were collected from all birds. pigeons were also screened by bacteriological, mycological, and parasitological examinations. no pathogenic microorganisms were found. mononuclear cells isolated from the spleen were divided into three parts. one part was used to determine the percentage of T CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and IgM+ cells with the flow cytometry. the third part was used in RNA extraction to evaluate the expression of gene which encodes IFN-. dialysis was performed in 14 kDa cut-off dialysis membrane (Viskase, Willowbrook, IL, USA) for four hours and with a changed fresh buffer for an additional 16 hours with the same volume ratio. the whole obtained protein was divided into aliquots necessary for all further procedures (pigeons\u2019 immunization, ELISA, ELISPOT) assay was performed on Nunc-Immuno Module plates using the Antibody Pair Buffer Kit. each well was coated with 100 L of PiCV rCP (concentration 20 g/ mL) suspended in a coating buffer. the rabbit anti-pigeon IgG (Antibodies-online, Atlanta, GA, USA) diluted (1:30,000) in the assay buffer were used as primary antibodies. whole spleens were homogenized using a tissue grinder (Kimble, DWK Life Sciences, Millville, NJ, USA) in 9 mL of a complete growth medium (RPMI\u20131640, 10% FBS, 1% MEM non-essential amino acid solution, 1% penicillin\u2013streptomycin, 1% HEPES, 1% sodium pyruvate) a homogenous suspension was obtained and the centrifuged cell pellets were re cell suspensions were rinsed twice and centrifuged (450 g, 10 min, 20 \u00b0C) cell pellets were resuspended in 2.5 mL of 40% Percoll density gradient. cell concentrations and the percentage of viable cells isolated from peripheral blood, spleen and bursa of Fabricius were determined in a Vi-cell XR analyzer. the samples were standardized to 1.5 105 cells and deposited directly in the wells of the previously prepared plates. the plates were rinsed 3 times with PBS-Tween 20 (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) and incubated overnight (4 \u00b0C) with biotinylated rabbit anti-pigeon IgY (Antibodies-online, Atlanta, GA, USA) data was expressed as the mean absolute number of SFU SD per 1 106 mononuclear cells in each group for each day of sampling. mabs against pigeon CD3+, CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes are not commercially availble. for this reason they were developed and provided by Dr. Arkadiusz Miazek, M.Sc.Eng. Marta Lisowska and Dr. Andrzej Rapak. half a million mononuclear cells isolated from each sample were stained for certain T and B cell subpopulations according to the following scheme. samples from blood and spleen were divided into four parts and each one was stained with anti-CD3 (FITC) mabs or anti-IgM (FITC) polyclonal antibodies. RNA quality was evaluated in a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) concentration of eluted RNA was measured with a NanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. the samples were stored at 80 \u00b0C until further analysis. the expression of the gene encoding IFN- was determined with the qPCR method described previously. pigeons as SPF (specific pathogen free) pigeons are unavailable, sixty six-week-old carrier pigeons were obtained from a private breeder. the flock in the breeding facility is under professional veterinary service. mononuclear cells isolated from the spleen were divided into three parts. one part was used to determine the percentage of T CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and IgM+ cells with the flow cytometry. the third part was used in RNA extraction to evaluate the expression of gene which encodes IFN-. the procedure of expression and protein purification was performed in accordance with the method described in our previous study. 0.3% SDS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) was added to the target protein and it was refolded by dialyzing into a buffer (pH 8.0) this solution was mixed with 200 L of oil-based adjuvant (Montanide ISA71 R VG) provided by Seppic (Paris, France) each well was coated with 100 L of PiCV rCP (concentration 20 g/ mL) suspended in a coating buffer B. each well was coated with 100 L of PiCV rCP (concentration 20 g/mL) mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood, spleen and bursa of Fabricius samples using the following protocol. whole spleens were homogenized using a manual Dounce tissue grinder. bursa of Fabricius samples were cut into 2 mm pieces and digested with a collagenase type IV solution. cell suspensions were rinsed twice and centrifuged in 2.5 mL of 40% Percoll density gradient. cell concentrations and percentage of viable cells isolated from peripheral blood, spleen and bursa of Fabricius were determined in a Vi-cell XR analyzer. multiScreen plates were coated with 100 L/well of the PBS solution of PiCV rCP (conc. 20 g/1 mL) the plates were rinsed 3 times with PBS-Tween 20 solution (0.05%; Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) and once with PBS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) then blocked with the RPMI medium containing 20% FBS (Sigma Aldrich, Schnelldorf, Germany) at 37 \u00b0C for anti-PiCV rCP B IgY+ spot-forming units (SFU) were counted with an Eli.Scan plate scanner and Eli.Analyse software. data was expressed as the mean absolute number of SFU SD per 1 106 of mononuclear cells in each group for each day of sampling. the optimal concentrations of mabs were 7 L/ one million cells (anti-CD3 and anti-CD8 antibodies) and 8 L/ one million cells (anti-CD4 antibodies) the cross-reactivity of goat anti-chicken IgM-FITC polyclonal antibodies were evaluated in the previous study [37]. data were expressed as the mean percentage of a certain subpopulation of lymphocytes standard deviation in each group for each day of sampling. RNA quality was evaluated in a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA) concentration of eluted RNA was standardized to 0.5 g per sample. the initial mean OD450 reached 0.21 0.06 and 0.28 0.08 for E and C groups. a PiCV rCP antibody response was detected in group E birds on 23 dpv. pigeons were immunized with PiCV rCP mixed with adjuvant. the mean number of SFU in the spleen of PiCV rCP immunized pigeons was the highest on 2 dpv (193.33 55.45 per 1 106 of mononuclear cells) the difference in SFU number in spleens between both groups of birds was significant only on two (p = 0.00) and 23 (p = 0.01) dpv, because of high SD value. the percentage of B IgM+ in the blood approximated 7.13 0.92% in pigeons from both groups. in all sampling dates, except the fourth one, the percentage of this lymphocyte subpopulation was negligibly higher in the control than in the PiCV rCP immunized birds. b 38.63 SD 0.94 0.63 0.79 1.75 1.23 0.91 1.46 2.14 2.33 1.22 2.6 2.98 2.75 2.64 1.26 C M 6.5 7.26 7.26 7.26 7.25 7.28 12.95 12.76 14.28 14.3 14.08 36.3 36.83 37.86 36.86. the percentage of B IgM+ in the bursa of Fabricius in the control group pigeons was constant and reached 37.3 3% on average. the values in the same column with different superscripts differ significantly at p 0.05 in U Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. group CD3 + (%) CD4+ (%) CD8+ (%) dpv dpv 0 2 23 39 46 0 2 23 39 46 0 2 23 39 46 blood E M 32.38 23.23 28.43 37.6 30.98 10.71 11.14 11.01 13.74 13.83 10.3 10.52 11.54 11.25 13.26 SD the percentage of T CD3+ lymphocytes subpopulation varied during the whole experiment from 47.78 4.45% to 57.71 2.93% in group E pigeons. on 23 dpv, the percentage of this subpopulation of lymphocytes was significantly lower in E than in C group birds. qPCR for IFN- Gene Expression In blood samples the expression of gene encoding IFN- was higher in group E pigeons than in control group during whole experiment. the expression of IFN- gene in spleen samples was inconsiderably higher in the pigeons immunized with PiCV rCP than in the control group throughout the post immunization period. the asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference between investigated groups at p 0.01 in U Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. Error bars represent the standard error of the mean. the mean number of SFU in the spleen of PiCV rCP immunized pigeons was the highest on 2 dpv (193.33 55.45 per 1 106 of mononuclear cells) the difference in SFU number in spleens between both groups of birds was significant only on two (p = 0.00) and 23 (p = 0.01) dpv. the asterisks indicates a statistically significant difference between the investigated groups, where * p 0.05, ** p 0.01 in U Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. errors represent the standard error of the mean. 7.09 6.82 8.84 6.51 13.53 12.91 13.76 14.63 13.66 36.26 34.85 38.48 32.41 b 38.63 SD 0.94 0.63 0.79 1.75 1.23 0.91 1.46 2.14 2.33 1.22 2.6 2.98 2.75 2.64 1.26 C M 6.5 7.26 7.26 7.25 7.28 12.95 12.76 14.28 14.3 14.08 36.3 36.83 37.86 36.86 a 38.51 SD 0.69 0.53 0.59 1.33 nd\u2014not determined, E\u2014experimental group (immunized with PiCV rCP mixed with adjuvant), C\u2014control group (immunized with adjuvant only) differ significantly at p 0.05 in U Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. group CD3 + (%) CD4+ (%) CD8+ (%) dpv dpv 0 2 23 39 46 0 2 23 39 46 blood E M 32.38 23.23 28.43 the percentage of T CD3+ lymphocytes subpopulation varied during the whole experiment from 47.78 4.45% to 57.71 2.93% in group E pigeons. on 23 dpv, the percentage of this subpopulation of lymphocytes was significantly lower in E than in C group birds. qPCR for IFN- Gene Expression In blood samples the expression of gene encoding IFN- was higher in group E pigeons than in control group during whole experiment. expression of IFN- gene in spleen samples was inconsiderably higher in the pigeons immunized with PiCV rCP than in the control group throughout the post-immunization period. samples were collected from pigeons of both studied groups on days 0, 2, 23, 39, and 46 after first immunization (dpv) the asterisks indicate a statistically significant difference between investigated groups where * p 0.05, ** p 0.01 in U Mann-Whitney non-parametric test. errors represent the standard error of the mean. antibody response to a defined antigen is more useful in studies of the humoral immune system than the measurement of antibody response to a complex antigen, like that found in pathogens. in the present study, the percentage of IgM+ B cells in the PiCV rCP immunized pigeons was similar in both investigated groups throughout the experiment. however, the percentage of IgM+ B cells in the PiCV rCP immunized pigeons was more diverse the OD450 value peaked to 3.87 0.11 on 46 dpv in group E pigeons. the difference between samples influencing the SD value gradually decreased after 23 dpv, which shows a correct immune response to the antigen. the lifespan of plasma cells (IgY-SBC) is lower than the half-life period of specific antibodies. only a small population of antibody-secreting cells appears later as memory cells. this dependency was observed not only in our study, but also in the research conducted with the infectious bronchitis virus. no commercially available monoclonal antibodies are dedicated for pigeons. a protocol was developed for producing monoclonal antibodies against pigeon T cells. the purified antibodies were checked for cross-reactivity with mononuclear cells isolated from chicken and turkey. subpopulations between unvaccinated piglets and those immunized with porcine circovirus sub-unit vaccine were attributed to the physiological development of immune competence in growing pigs. the immune reaction to a viral infection and vaccination also leads to enhanced synthesis of interferons. pigeon immunization with PiCV rCP induced both humoral and cell-mediated immunity, which was manifested by a significant increase in the number of anti-PiCV rCP IgY-SBC since 2 dpv. an analogous mechanism could be involved in the immune response against pigeon circovirus. vaccine could protect pigeons against such infections, and possibly lower the prevalence of YPDS. if developed, pigeons will be vaccinated, if developed."}
