{"summary": "in 2003, china took measures to contain an outbreak of 'flu-like illness'. failure to have such tools puts lives at risk by hampering containment. sensitivity comes at a cost, however, in terms of time, complexity of assay, and robustness of measurements. reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR is used to detect the presence of viral genomes or specific viral genes. a combined approach using both techniques overcomes detection problems when either the infection produces a weak antibody response or when virus-specific transcripts are in low abundance. we therefore need a rapid, sensitive approach that is capable of identifying multiple viruses simultaneously. protein microarrays may have antibodies or antigens arrayed as probes. the hybridized chip is scanned and the image processed to provide corresponding profiles. each microarray can be applied to detection and identification. variola virus causes smallpox and has two subtypes, variola major and variola minor, of differing pathogenicity. arrays have been developed for the detection and distinction of hantaviruses. arrays are capable of distinguishing between isolates that have up to 90% sequence similarity. the availability of commercial chips covering the whole host genome allows genome-wide changes to be examined. smaller customized host chips can be constructed with a more restricted number of probes. one group identified 258 cellular mRNAs whose level changed by a factor of four or greater before the onset of HCMV DNA replication. lton et al. [16] applied protein microarrays to the detection of antibodies to the protozoan parasite toxoplasma gondii, rubella virus, CMV and herpes simplex viruses. the system was validated by comparison with existing ELISAs. the results showed 80% agreement between ELISA and array. bike et al. [19] demonstrated the use of engineered B cells capable of detecting pathogens within 3 minutes. their CANARY sensor comprises B cells that express the calcium-dependent bioluminescent protein aequorin together with membrane-bound pathogen-specific antibodies. one of the engineered B-cell lines described by the authors could detect spores of Bacillus anthracis. 'cell-omic' sensors despite the fact that microarray-based technologies are becoming increasingly rapid, cheap and ever more sensitive, there are still drawbacks. one approach to maximizing the effectiveness of existing technology is to combine complementary technologies. 'cell-omic sensors' have parallel high-throughput capabilities of arrays coupled with speed of engineered B cells. cell-based detection systems can be combined with arrayed probes to allow multi-parameter analysis. by arraying cells in a monolayer on top of probes, it would be possible to detect changes in multiple cellular components simultaneously. detection of intracellular components would require more sophisticated techniques. a collection of such infection profiles, an Infection Profile Database, needs to be put together that sets out standards and requirements that would help such high-dimensional data to be translated into clinical utility. a potential solution might involve identifying a signature that is produced early in infection and yet can be sustained for capturing later."}
