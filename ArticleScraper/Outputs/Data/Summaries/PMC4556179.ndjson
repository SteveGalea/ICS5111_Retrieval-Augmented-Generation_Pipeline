{"summary": "the pandemic influenza outbreak research modeling team partnered with the national Collaborating Centre for Infectious Diseases to hold a national workshop. it aims to strengthen connections to public health practice and broaden its scope. knowledge translation remained a challenge that the Pan-InfORM was established in part to address (9) the pan-infORM has undertaken several national initiatives for knowledge brokering. it includes the evaluation of Canada\u2019s response to the spring and winter waves of the novel H1N1 pandemic. models can be used to identify key uncertainties in parameters and generate qualitative predictions, such as the effect of behavioural changes on the trends and distribution of an infection in the population. the overarching goal of modelling is to support evidence-based public health policy. the availability of Aboriginal-specific information has been inconsistent at best Modellers and users can be called on to create model frameworks and ask questions that will provide better information about where there are inequities and inequalities. a community of practice network can be tasked with the standardization of this process to ensure that synergies exist when models are formulated to inform clinical or health policy decisions Roles and responsibilities Clarification on the roles of health agencies and jurisdictions are needed to engage partners. a centralized list or network could contribute to greater capacity for public health jurisdictions. in the context of 'determinants of health' and 'health equity', one needs to take into account differential health status and population structure of First Nations, Inuit and M\u00e9tis people, population-level patterns of abuse, poverty and historical trauma. building partnerships and an iterative exchange allows for goals and facts to be clearly identified. effective partnerships require willingness and commitment, alignment of values, mechanisms to engage early and continuously. the outcomes are drawn from an agent-based simulation model of Albany, a small community in western Australia with a population of approximately 30,000 individuals. a strategy of individual school closures would be more effective than simultaneous closures across a region. the outcomes are drawn from an agent-based simulation model of a small community in western Australia with a population of approximately 30,000 individuals. the fourth session of the workshop provided an opportunity for participants to discuss the establishment and potential impact of a Community of Practice. Summary of challenges and actions identified to improve consistency in terminology in public health modelling Opportunities and strengths a Community of Practice can provide. effectiveness of immunization programs Strategies for early identification and treatment of active tuberculosis Priorities for modelling consistency Develop glossary of terms used in modelling consistent with dictionary of terms for infectious disease epidemiology Develop conceptual frameworks for natural history model of important diseases using standard terminologies Provide guidelines and develop criteria for assessing the quality and relevance of databases for modelling Develop guidelines for review and assessment of modelling research quality. the virtual coP network will provide opportunities to access, analyze, synthesize and utilize reliable information and databases in a timely fashion. in times of uncertainty, the virtual coP network will provide opportunities to access, analyze, synthesize and utilize reliable information and databases in a timely fashion."}
