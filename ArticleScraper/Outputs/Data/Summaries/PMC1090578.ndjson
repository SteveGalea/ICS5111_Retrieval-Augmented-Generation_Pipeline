{"summary": "the deletion allele of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene is associated with hypoxemia in SARS patients. the ACE D allele has been shown to be more prevalent in patients suffering from adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) there is no significant difference in the genetic sequences of viruses causing the two major outbreaks in Hong Kong, namely the Prince of Wales Hospital and Amoy Gardens outbreaks. however, several association studies have been conducted to investigate the possible contribution of host genetic factors in the determination of the susceptibility and prognosis of the disease. the recruitment of patients depended on the availability of blood samples. all patients, including survivors and deceased patients, with available blood samples were recruited. all patients, including survivors and deceased patients, with available blood samples were recruited. reactions were set up in a volume of 25 l containing 0.1 M of each primer, 1X buffer II (Applied Biosystems), 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 1.25 U Taq polymerase (AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase, Applied Biosystems) and 20 ng DNA. electrophoresed and visualized in 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide. a patient was classified as having ARDS if he or she fulfilled all criteria of the joint American/European Consensus for ARDS [12], including: (1) acute onset of respiratory distress; (2) presence of bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray; (3) having a ratio of arterial partial pressure of oxygen to inspired fractional oxygen concentration (PaO2/FiO2) of less than 26.8 kPa and absence of clinical evidence of left heart failure. amplification products were electrophoresed and visualized in 2% agarose gels with ethidium bromide. statistical analyses were performed using SigmaStat, Ver. 3.0; SPSS. disease associations were compared by chi-square tests. the genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism in the SARS patients and control subjects are shown in table 2. there was no significant difference in the genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism between the two groups. 326 Genotypic frequency DD 15 (11%) 43 (13%) ID 65 (46%) 133 (41%) II 60 (43%) 150 (46%) 2 value = 1.43, df = 2, p = 0.489 Allelic frequency D 95 (34%) 219 (34%) I 185 (66%) 433 (66%) 2 value = 0.000624, df = 1, p = 0.233 Logistic regression on the development of ARDS. age was found to be the only significant factor that determined the development of ARDS in SARS patients. logistic regression on the requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. seventeen of the 140 SARS patients developed ARDS during the course of their illness. the demographic data of the SARS patients are categorized by the development of ARDS (ARDS vs non-ARDS) the genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism in the SARS patients and control subjects are shown in table 2. there was no significant difference in the genotypic distributions and allelic frequencies of ACE I/D polymorphism between the two groups. df = 2, p = 0.489 Allelic frequency D 95 (34%) 219 (34%) I 185 (66%) 433 (66%) 2 value = 0.000624, df = 1, p = 0.233 Logistic regression on the development of ARDS or requirement of intensive care. age was found to be the only significant factor that determined the development of ARDS in SARS patients. logistic regression on the requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. age is the only significant factor associated with the development of ARDS. age and male sex are independently associated with the requirement of intensive care in SARS patients. we have used a well defined endpoint of ARDS instead of the requirement of. 80% of patients were given supplemental oxygen during the course of their illness in our cohort. ARDS is the more severe end of the spectrum of disease progression. previous studies on Caucasian populations have suggested that the presence of the D allele of the ACE gene is associated with increased incidence of ARDS. ACE I/D polymorphism is not directly related to poor outcomes after SARS-coronavirus infection in Chinese. YMDL, KCAC, RWKC, SCCC and YKT have filed patent applications on aspects concerning the genomics and detection of the SARS-coronavirus."}
