{"summary": "autophagy is the only known mechanism for cells to dispose of cytosolic components too large for proteasomal degradation. pathogens that encounter autophagy sporadically are more likely to be restricted by autophagy in their ability to colonise the cytosol. some of the mechanisms that target pathogens for autophagy have been revealed 3, 4, 5. in this review we will discuss the mechanisms of selective macroautophagy of pathogens and its contribution to innate and adaptive immunity. we will also provide several examples of how certain bacteria and viruses are restricted by macroautophagy, whereas others escape autophagy and sometimes use this pathway for propagation. lipidated ATG8 facilitates tethering and fusion of vesicular membranes. once the autophagosome is completed, it rapidly fuses with lysosomes in a Rab7 (Ras-related in brain)-dependent fashion. this fusion is also facilitated by a PI3 kinase-containing ATG6. the membrane source for autophagosome formation is still heavily debated. the membrane source for autophagosome formation is still heavily debated. the membrane source for autophagosome formation is still heavily debated. macroautophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis are deployed to capture bacteria during their inwards journey. macroautophagy engulfs pathogens with additional autophagosome-derived membranes. the autophagosomal double membrane restricts pathogen dispersal and provides an additional barrier against potential attempts of pathogens to manipulate cellular processes. LC3-assisted phagocytosis requires a subset of autophagy genes for labelling of phagosomes with ATG8/LC3. damage to the limiting membrane of the pathogen-containing vesicle exposes the cytosol to glycans previously hidden inside the vesicle. ubiquitin-coated bacteria are targeted for autophagy by three apparently non-redundant cargo receptors. ubiquitin-coated bacteria are targeted for autophagy by three apparently non-redundant cargo receptors. these ligases likely represent novel pattern recognition or danger receptors. the strongest candidate so far is LRSAM1 (leucine-rich, sterile motif), a RING (Really Interesting New Gene) domain E3 ubiquitin ligase with leucine-rich repeats required for the autophagy of S. typhimurium [21]. additional pattern recognition receptors with proposed or established affinity for peptidoglycan also contribute to antibacterial autophagy. ubiquitin- and galectin-8-dependent eat-me signals for selective autophagy are detected by adaptor proteins. ubiquitin- and galectin-8-dependent eat-me signals for selective autophagy are detected by adaptor proteins. ubiquitin- and galectin-8-dependent eat-me signals for selective autophagy are detected by adaptor proteins. p62 paralogue NBR1 (neighbour of the BRCA1 gene 1) is not required to restrict the growth of S. typhimurium [18], but may contribute to the autophagy attack against S. flexneri [31]. NDP52 recruits TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase) in complex with SINTBAD (similar to NAP1 TBK1 adaptor) or NAP1 (NAK-associated protein 1) to cytosol differential interactions with eat-me signals are likely to cause the occurrence of NDP52, p62 and optineurin in microdomains around S. typhimurium, populated by either NDP52 or p62 [36], NDP52 and optineurin but not p62 [3], or NDP52 and galectin-8 but not p62 [5], respectively. p62 recruits ubiquitylated cytosolic proteins to autolys LC3-negative structures are not restricting bacterial growth. closure of antibacterial autophagosomes requires hemifusion activity 7, 41. cells lacking LC3-conjugation machinery fail to enclose S. typhimurium in autophagosomal membranes. electron microscopy has revealed the simultaneous presence of additional onion-like multilamellar structures typical for canonical macrophagy against bacterial targets. a similar strategy is used by burkholderia pseudomallei, a Gram-negative bacterium causing melioidosis. ADPH oxidases appear to be required for the targeting of LC3 to phagosomes. the generation of diacylglycerol on salmonella-containing vacuoles also triggers recruitment of LC3. the ability of cells to distinguish phagosomes with \u2018innocent\u2019 and \u2018infectious\u2019 content may allow the preferential handling of infectious vesicles. the autophagy machinery contributes to the defence against pathogens in a variety of ways, either by conventional macroautophagy or by deploying subsets of autophagy genes to accomplish subcellular trafficking of proteins or the maturation of organelles. the ability of cells to defend themselves against invading pathogens represents an ancient form of immunity preceding the origin of multicellularity. toxin and two lipolytic enzymes, L. monocytogenes escapes from vacuole into the cytosol with high efficiency. autophagy is detected by galectin-3, -8 and -9, which may trigger autophagy as bacteria transiently colocalise with LC3. the vertebrate PGRP orthologues, called PGLYRPs, are unlikely to be involved in autophagy because they function extracellularly as peptidoglycan amidases and antimicrobial proteins. recognition of peptidoglycan fragments still contributes to autophagy induction in mammalian cells because NOD1 and ATG16L1 are recruited to bacterial entry sites. Shigella vacuoles are detected by galectin-3, -8 and -9. the membrane remnants codistribute with ubiquitin-, p62- and LC3-positive structures. this suggests they are targeted by selective autophagy. macroautophagy and LC3-associated phagocytosis engulf pathogens with additional autophagosome-derived membranes. the autophagosomal double membrane restricts pathogen dispersal and provides an additional barrier against potential attempts of pathogens to manipulate cellular processes. LC3-assisted phagocytosis is triggered by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and potentially other pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in response to microorganisms taken up by phagocytosis or that have actively invaded nonphagocytic cells. damage to the limiting membrane exposes the cytosol to glycans previously hidden inside the vesicle. somes are created by the core autophagy machinery and have features similar to conventional autophagosomes. formation requires the involvement of Rab7 at early steps of formation. antibacterial autophagosomes also have the tendency to enwrap their cargo into onion-like membrane layers 16, 18, 19. PGRP-LE (peptidoglycan recognition protein-LE) restricts the growth of Listeria monocytogenes in Drosophila. NOD1 (Nucleotide-Binding Oligomerization Domain) and NOD2 attack Gram-negative and -positive bacteria in humans. lysosomes recruit galectin-8 to vesicle remnants, as does damage caused by L. monocytogenes or Shigella flexneri. the human genome encodes about 12 galectins, of which galectin-1, galectin-3 and galectin-9 are recruited to damaged vesicles 5, 28, 29. the functional consequences of their recruitment to membrane remnants remain to be identified. NDP52 recruits TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase) in complex with SINTBAD or NAP1 (NAK-associated protein 1) to cytosol-exposed bacteria by detecting either a galectin-8 or a polyubiquitin eat-me signal 5, 32, 34, 35. a third cargo receptor, optineurin, binds LC3 with high affinity only if phosphorylated by TBK1 because it lacks p62 recruits ubiquitylated cytosolic proteins to autolysosomes. p62 recruits ALFY, a 400-kDa protein that binds ATG12\u2013ATG5\u2013ATG16L1 complexes and PI3P-containing membranes. LC3-conjugation machinery, cells lacking ATG9 or FIP200 fail to enclose S. typhimurium in autophagosomal membranes. however, atg9 / or fip200 / cells still accumulate LC3 around the bacteria, probably by conjugating LC3 to the damaged SCV membrane. the current model of antibacterial autophagy is therefore simplistic and further work is required to understand how distinct autophagy proteins are independently recruited to cytosol-ex mycobacterial phagosomes acquire LC3 and mature into phagolysosomes, consistent with LAP. however, electron microscopy has revealed the simultaneous presence of additional onion-like multilamellar structures typical for canonical macrophagy against bacterial targets. oles also triggers recruitment of LC3, most likely during LAP. engulfment of noninfectious cargo triggers LAP. cells in entotic vacuoles may expose phosphatidylserine before showing morphological signs of cell death. at least three classes of receptors detect invaders and ensure delivery to the lysosome. pathogens that invade the cytosol as part of their normal life cycle have to slip through all the nets. pathogens that invade the cytosol have to slip through all the nets. L. monocytogenes deploys ActA (actin nucleator A), a cell surface protein and functional analogue of host Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) proteins. ActA prevents coating of L. monocytogenes with ubiquitin and thereby interferes with selective autophagy. SLAPs are single membrane vesicles positive for LC3 that are formed in a listeriolysin-O-dependent manner. the membrane remnants of Shigella vacuoles are detected by galectin-3, -8 and -9. SLAPs represent a stalemate between autophagic attack and bacterial countermeasures. IcsA is directly recognised by ATG5, which restricts bacterial growth by targeting bacteria into autophagosomes. septin-encaged Shigella colocalises with NDP52, p62 and LC3 suggesting they are targeted by selective autophagy. depletion of SEPT2 or SEPT9 prevents p62 recruitment. a phylogenetically heterogeneous group of bacteria proliferate in double- or multilamellar LC3+ vesicles. these bacteria fail to grow in atg5 / cells, whereas autophagy induction by rapamycin enhances their proliferation. how these bacteria co-opt autophagy and how autophagy contribute to bacterial growth remains unknown. LC3-negative autophagosomes can be formed if bacteria selectively engage only a subset of autophagy genes. they may represent a physiological pendant to alternative autophagy in atg5 / or atg7 / cells. however, the replication of F. tularensis is not dependent on autophagy. two poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A induce this vesicle accumulation. only 2BC is required to lipidate ATG8/LC3A and B. downregulation of macroautophagy via siRNA-mediated silencing of either of the two molecules of macroautophagy results in diminished virus replication. RNA silencing of several essential atg products suppresses HCV replication 74, 76, 77. HCV also prevents fusion of autophagic membranes with lysosomes to promote its own replication. dengue virus generates energy for its replication via macroautophagy. phagosome formation 83, whereas HIV nef is involved in blocking autophagosome fusion with lysosomes. this stabilisation of autophagic vesicles, autophagosomes themselves or multivesicular bodies (MVBs), augments virus production and release of infectious particles 76, 80. RNA silencing of ATG6/BECLIN-1, ATG7 or IRGM inhibits HIV particle release 76, 80. the RNA virus Sindbis virus replicates to similar levels in macroautophagy-deficient neurons. but macroautophagy ensures survival of infected host cells in vivo. both genes encode inhibitors of macroautophagy. macroautophagy regulates at least some inflammatory cytokines. this restricts pathogens by innate immune responses and shape adaptive immune responses. macroautophagy can transport viral replication intermediates into endosomes with TLRs. phylogenetically heterogeneous group of bacteria proliferate in double- or multilamellar LC3+ vesicles. these bacteria fail to grow in atg5 / cells, whereas autophagy induction by rapamycin enhances their proliferation. how these bacteria co-opt autophagy remains unknown. LC3-negative autophagosomes can be formed if bacteria selectively engage only a subset of autophagy genes. they may represent a physiological pendant to alternative autophagy in atg5 / or atg7 / cells. exposure to low pH of autolysosomes may trigger expression of genes required for egress, reinfection or extracellular life. poliovirus seems to use at least parts of the macroautophagy machinery to assemble membrane structures for its replication. the flavivirus hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces significant membrane remodelling for its replication and uses macroautophagy to do this. IRGM suppresses HCV replication 74, 76, 77. another flavivirus, dengue virus, generates energy for its replication via macroautophagy. this catabolic activity leads to the turnover of lipid droplets and triglycerides via autophagosomes. this stabilisation of autophagic vesicles, autophagosomes themselves or multivesicular bodies augments virus production and release of infectious particles 76, 80. RNA silencing of ATG6/BECLIN-1, ATG7 or IRGM inhibits HIV particle release 76, 80. this inhibits autophagosome degradation in order to replicate efficiently in myeloid cells. both genes encode inhibitors of macroautophagy without which infection in mice is compromised 88, 89. MHV blocks ATG3 and ATG6/BECLIN-1 with its viral FLIP. p62/sequestosome and possibly its recruitment via SMURF1 have been implicated in the recruitment of pathogens to autophagosomes 4, 87. macroautophagy can transport viral replication intermediates into endosomes. TLR-mediated type I IFN production by Sendai virus or VSV-infected plasmacytoid dendritic cells depends on macroautophagy. increased reactive oxygen species production is also influenced by macroautophagy. ligands, self-protein-derived peptides can be found. some originate from the mammalian ATG8 homologues LC3 and GABARAP 97, 98. macroautophagy contributes to MHC class II loading of cytosolic and nuclear antigens. pathway has been suggested to deliver pathogen-derived antigens for MHC class II loading. the first is the nuclear antigen 1 of EBV (EBNA1). this protein ensures replication of the viral genome in the nucleus prior to host cell division and anchors EBV DNA to mitotic chromosomes during mitosis. macroautophagy deficiency after atg5 knockout in CD11c-positive cells. addition of soluble ovalbumin (OVA) or OVA-coated splenocytes resulted in decreased MHC class II presentation. this phenotype would fit with three studies showing a role for parts of the macrophagy machinery in phagosome fusion with lysosomes. peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) responsible for citrullination of endocytosed proteins was only able to reach phagosomes via autophagosomes. fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes and composition of phagosomal content could be modified by macroautophagy. developing T cells are educated to recognize self-MHC molecules in the thymic cortex in a process called positive selection. negative selection of a wild-type precursor repertoire was unaffected. negative selection of a wild-type precursor repertoire was unaffected. autophagosomes were found frequently to fuse with MIICs in TECs. plasmacytoid and conventional DC development are unaffected by loss of macroautophagy 91, 108. mature T cells need to decrease mitochondria content during transition from the thymus to the periphery. macroautophagy deficiency prevents this due to loss of mitochondria degradation. 20\u201330% of the MHC class II presented ligands are derived from cytosolic and nuclear antigens [97], suggesting an intracellular antigen processing pathway for MHC class II loading. autophagosomes have been found frequently to fuse with late endosomal MHC class II containing compartments (MIICs), in which antigen is loaded onto MHC class II molecules 99, 100. extracellular pathogens reach this MHC class II loading compartment via endocytosis. this antigen processing pathway has been suggested to deliver pathogen-derived antigens for MHC class II loading. two of these have been investigated in more detail in several studies. antigens fused to NeoR are more efficiently presented on MHC class II molecules. phosphotransferase II (NeoR) 85, 106 is sensitive to macroautophagy inhibition. it is not nuclear localisation in general, but maybe subcompartmentalisation in this organelle that determines accessibility of antigens. autophagosome cargo could render phagosomes more processive by delivering hydrolases to these vesicles through fusion. peptidylarginine deiminase (PAD) responsible for citrullination of endocytosed proteins was only able to reach phagosomes via autophagosomes. this could result in more efficient extracellular antigen processing onto MHC class II molecules. autophagosomes were found frequently to fuse with MIICs in TECs. autophagosomes were found frequently to fuse with MIICs in TECs. mutations have been found associated with the familial form of this autoimmune disease. macroautophagy deficiency prevents mitochondria degradation. macroautophagy-deficient T cells cannot efficiently mobilize Ca2+ upon TCR stimulation, resulting in impaired activation. macroautophagy has emerged as an important cellular pathway for pathogen restriction and replication, as well as antigen processing. pathogens that escape endosomes are imported into autophagosomes. autophagy provides peptides for presentation on MHC molecules from self-antigens and pathogens during thymic selection and during peripheral immune responses. HC class I presentation for CD8+ T cell responses 134, 135, 136. the importance of canonical macroautophagy in pathogen infection and immune responses is now well established."}
