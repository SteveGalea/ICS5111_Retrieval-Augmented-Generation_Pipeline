{"summary": "the early life period is characterized by an increased vulnerability to viral pathogens such as influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, HSV-1 or human cytomegalovirus. this has long been thought to result from the incapacity of the neonatal immune system to raise protective T cell responses. recent work has suggested that innate immune responses are distinctly regulated in early and adult life, the vulnerability to pathogens. plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) play pleiotropic roles in viral infections. by producing type I IFNs and, IFN-I, they promote the apoptosis of infected cells, activate NK cells and protect conventional dendritic cells. pDCs may not exert adult-like function in vivo in early life microenvironment despite their in vitro activation. i.v. injection of 100pfu of LCMV-WE. in one experiment, 10pfu were injected. titers of infected spleens are expressed as pfu per gram of spleen. anti-CD4 (clone RM4-5, BD Pharmingen), anti-IFN- (clone XMG-1, BD Pharmingen), anti-IL2 (JES6-5H4, BD Pharmingen), anti-TNF- (clone MP6-XT22, BD Pharmingen) cells were stained for cytokines using the cytofix/cytoperm kit (BD Pharmingen) 10 thousands units of recombinant mouse IFN- (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany) was injected 4h, 8h and 12h after infection. additional single injection of 1g of pegylated human IFN- 2a was added at 6h. cell purification Untouched pDCs were isolated from spleens. in vitro and in vivo responses to polyU Isolated untouched pDCs were stimulated o.n. with different concentrations of polyU ssRNA / polyethylenimine or polyethylenimine (Sigma-Aldrich) alone. infant and adult mice were injected i.v. with weight-adjusted PolyU (6 and 15g, respectively) IRF-7-forward 5\u2019-GGGAGGCCCAAGGAGAAG-3\u2019 and IRF-7-reverse 5\u2019-CATACCCATGGCTCCAGCTT-3\u2019; myD88-forward 5\u2019-CCTTGATGACCCCCTAGGACA-3\u2019 and MyD88-reverse 5\u2019-CAGATAAAGGCATCGAAAAGTTCC-3\u2019; TLR7-forward 5\u2019-GATCGTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG a, EEF1A1, Gapdh, GusB), observed as similarly expressed in infant and adult samples. differences between multiple groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA followed by the Tukey multiple comparison test. differences with probability values 0.05 were considered significant. ethics statement Manipulations of mice were carried out according to Swiss and European guidelines. staining of TCR was performed by using dimeric MHC class I-peptide complexes according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions (BD Pharmingen). cells were analyzed using the FACSAria (BD Biosciences) or the Gallios (Beckman Coulter) and FlowJo Software (Tree Star, Ashland, OR) peptides for 7h at 37\u00b0C in presence of anti-CD28 (clone 37.51, BD Pharmingen) and anti-CD49d (clone 9C10, BD Pharmingen) were added for the last 6 hours. cells stained for cytokines using the cytofix/cytoperm kit (BD Pharmingen) cDNA was synthesized from 0.5g of total RNA from total spleens, cDCs or flow-sorted pDCs. cDNA was synthesized from 0.5g of total RNA using random hexamers\u2013oligo d(T) primers. PCR reactions contained diluted cDNA, 2 x Power SYBR Green Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) each reaction was performed in three replicates, with ActinG, EEf1, gapdh and GusB as internal controls genes for data normalisation. four house-keeping genes (Actin-gamma, EEF1A1, Gapdh, GusB) were used for gene normalization between samples. differences between multiple groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. results Delayed production of IFN-I and impaired viral control in 2-week-old mice. IFN- was already detected in the spleen and serum at 24h, peaked at 48h and remained detectable up to 72h-96h after infection. in 2-week-old mice, IFN- remained significantly lower at 24h, transiently reached adult levels at 48h but returned to baseline levels earlier than in adult mice. impaired early viral control is associated to a delayed/shorter IFN- burst in infant mice. LCMV-infected 2-week-old vs. adult wild-type (WT) or IFN-I receptor-deficient (IFNAR-/-) mice. splenic LCMV titers had already declined to very low levels in adult and infant IFNAR-/- mice. titers persisted at similarly high titers in adult and infant IFNAR-/- mice. 118-126-specific IFN- producing CD8+ T cells were subtracted. pDC response to LCMV in infant mice pDCs has been identified as one major source of immediate-early IFN-I in LCMV-infected adult mice. more than 1000 IRF7+ pDCs from at least 4 different individual adult or 4 different pools of 6 to 8 infant mice were counted. one of three representative experiments is shown. LCMV infection significantly increased the expression of IRF-7 in both adult and infant pDCs. constitutive and post-infection levels remained significantly lower in infant pDCs. lack of an immediate-early burst of IFN- in LCMV-infected infant mice correlated with limited pDC activation, IRF-7 expression and nuclear translocation. mRNA expression of myD88, TLR7, TLR9 and NF-B (A) or E2-2 and IRF-8 (B) in sorted pDCs from spleens of infant or adult mice before (nave) and 1 day after LCMV infection. n = 4 pools of 2 adult mice or 3 pools of 6 to 8 infant mice. upregulation of IFN- transcription was also lower in infant than in adult cDCs. the limited expression of several molecules critical for pDC activation/function indicated that numerous pathways were specifically down-regulated in infant pDCs. the E protein E2-2 directly activates multiple transcription factors involved in pDC development and function. the constitutive expression and in vivo activation of critical pDC genes controlled by E2-2 were specifically downregulated in early life pDCs. this likely prevents the generation of an immediate-early burst of IFN-I. polyU in vitro stimulated infant pDCs expressed even higher IFN- levels than adult pDCs. adult-like infant pDC responses were also elicited in vitro by imiquimod and CpG-A. concentrations of IFN- were tested in the supernatant by ELISA. expression of E2-2, IRF-7, MyD88, NF-B, TLR7 and TLR9 mRNAs was analyzed by real-time RT-PCR. results represent the fold increase derived from 3 independent experiments. IFN- supplementation significantly increased the frequency of LCMVnp118-126-specific CD8+ T cells. multifunctional CD4+ T cell responses were also restored to adult frequencies in IFN-treated 2-week-old infected mice. supplementing IFN- early after LCMV-WE infection significantly improved early (day 2) and late (day 12) viral control and restored CD4+ and CD8+ early life T cell responses. LCMVnp6-20-specific IFN-, IL-2 and TNF- secreting CD44+CD4+ T cells were subtracted. one of two representative experiments is shown. splenic LCMV titers had already declined to very low levels in adult and infant IFNAR-/- mice. titers persisted at similarly high titers in adult and infant IFNAR-/- mice. CD4+ T cells were similarly reduced in 2-week-old WT, 2-week-old IFNAR-/- and adult IFNAR-/- mice on day 10. the limited early life IFN- responses were associated to a similar pattern of impaired viral control / limited T cell responses in infant/infant IFNAR-/- mice. LCMV infection did not increase the percentage (Figure 3 A) and the number of pDCs. an upregulation of CD40 and CD86 (but not CD80) expression reflected the LCMV-induced activation of adult but not infant pDCs. n = 4 pools of 2 adult mice or 3 pools of 6 to 8 infant mice. one of two representative experiments is shown. more than 1000 IRF7+ pDCs were counted. myD88, TLR7 and TLR9 are critical for NF-B activation. pDCs showed lower constitutive levels of each of these genes compared to adult pDCs. both the constitutive and inducible expression of NF-B remained at significantly lower levels in infant than adult pDCs. infant and adult cDCs expressed adult levels of IRF-7, TLR9, TLR7, NF-B and MyD88 mRNAs before and 3 days after LCMV infection. the upregulation of IFN- transcription was also lower in infant than in adult cDCs. these blunted responses may contribute to the lower levels of IFN- observed at later time points after LCMV infection. infant pDC responses to polyU are downregulated in vivo but not in vitro. polyU effectively activated adult pDCs and induced high levels of serum IFN- as previously described. pDCs expressed even higher IFN- levels than adult pDCs. discrepancies between adult-like in vitro and limited in vivo infant pDC responses raise the possibility that specific regulatory networks may be at play in the infant microenvironment. recombinant murine IFN-, was injected 4h, 8h and 12h after infection. supplementing recombinant IFN- early after infection significantly improved early (day 2) and late (day 12) viral control. this confirms the critical role of the lack of immediate-early I. FN- burst in shaping of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses by IFN- supplementation. LCMV-WE infection of 2-week-old mice supplemented or not with 10,000U of recombinant mouse IFN- given i.p. at 4h, 8h and 12h after infection. neonatal murine pDCs have an adult response capacity when assessed in vitro. early life pDC responses are tightly regulated in vivo, possibly to avoid potentially harmful inflammatory or autoimmune reactions. IFN-I exert pleiotropic roles after pathogen recognition [10,39,40] cDC activation patterns were already adult-like in LCMV-infected infant mice. this is in accordance with a previous study [47] suggesting that cDCs are only partially dependent on IFN-I for their maturation. LCMV-WE ran a similar course in 2-week-old BALB/c as in adult and infant IFNAR-/- mice, confirming the importance of IFN- signaling. pDCs are the earliest source of IFN-I in many viral infections. pDCs were identified as the only source of the day 1 peak of IFN-. the failure of 2-week-old mice to generate early adult-like IFN-I responses reflects the specific pattern of their pDC responses. RNA and DNA viruses through the TLR7 and TLR9 endosomal sensors were downregulated in infant murine pDCs. this dampened early life pDC activation pattern correlated with an E2-2-orchestrated process limiting both IFN-I and NF-B-mediated IL-6 and TNF- responses. pDC activation appears critical for the fate of most early life viral pathogens. infant mice are highly vulnerable / fail to raise CD8+ T cell responses against viruses such as LCMV [9], VSV [62], influenza [63], HSV-1 [64] or chikungunya [65]. pDC activation appears critical for the fate of most early life viral pathogens. the blunted in vitro responses of cord blood pDCs were observed with whole blood or enriched ( 50% pure) pDC populations and showed that >99% pure cord blood pDCs do raise adult-like IFN- responses to TLR7 or TLR9 stimuli. pDCs are intrinsically able to generate adult-like type-I IFN responses in vitro but are influenced by exogenous factors."}
