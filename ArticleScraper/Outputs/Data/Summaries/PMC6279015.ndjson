{"summary": "sand fly saliva contains a large variety of proteins, some of which elicit specific antibody responses in the bitten hosts. recombinant proteins derived from sequence data on P. orientalis secreted salivary proteins were produced using either bacterial (five proteins) or mammalian (four proteins) expression systems and tested as antigens applicable for detection of anti-P. orientalis IgG. leishmania donovani is a causative agent of life-threatening visceral leishmaniasis (VL), with an estimated incidence reaching 39 thousand people annually. the optimal strategy for controlling VL depends on understanding the epidemiology and transmission of Le. donovani by its vectors. recombinant proteins have already proven their utility in large-scale studies screening anti-phlebotomine antibodies in human populations. a recombinant protein (rPpSP32) was used to screen for exposure to P. orientalis bites in Saudi Arabia and Tunis [23,24] the study protocols were approved by the national Ethical Committee of the federal Ministry of Health, Sudan. each volunteer was treated in accordance with international bio-ethical rules and laws for human sampling. eighteen serum samples were used as negative controls. the most antigenic proteins recognized by antisera from domestic animals were expressed also in mammalian system. the second yellow-related protein (mYEL2) was expressed in mammalian system due to its sequence similarity to mYEL1 (78%). coding recombinant proteins including His-tag at the C terminal end were cloned into VR2001-TOPO vector [28] and transformed by heat shock in TOP-10 cells. recombinant proteins were purified by a HPLC system (Bio-Rad) using a Stirred Ultrafiltration Cell unit (Millipore) with ultrafiltration membrane. several combinations of antigen-sera dilutions were tested to determine optical density (OD) values matching in a best way with anti-SGH. only the most promising recombinant proteins were tested on immunoblot with five human sera. recombinant proteins mAG5, mYEL1 and mAG5 + mYEL1 were electrophoretically separated on a 12% polyacrylamide gel. strips were either stained with amidoblack (Merck; 0.1% solution in 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid) or blocked in 5% non-fat milk diluted in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tw) overnight at all serum samples were used in duplicates, averages of measured ODs were calculated and the blank value was subtracted from each sample. the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test and as a post-hoc test Wilcoxon rank sum test with Holm correction were used. salivary glands of P. orientalis were dissected from 4\u20136 day old female sand flies into 20mM Tris buffer with 150mM NaCl (20 glands per 20 l of buffer) salivary glands were disrupted by three freeze-thawing cycles in liquid nitrogen into salivary gland homogenate. the bacterial forms of the recombinants with His-tag were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) gold cells (Agilent) and purified using Ni-NTA column (Bio-Rad) the synthetic DNA fragments coding recombinant proteins including His-tag at the C terminal end were cloned into VR2001-TOPO vector. protein concentration was measured using a nanodrop ND-1000 (ThermoFisher Scientific) spectrophotometer at 280 nm and calculated using the extinction coefficient of the protein. identity and high purity of the proteins was verified by mass spectrometry. plates were incubated with sera diluted in 2% non-fat dried milk. plates were washed and incubated for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C. chromogenic reaction was stopped by adding 10% sulfuric acid. strips were stained with amidoblack (Merck; 0.1% solution in 25% isopropanol and 10% acetic acid) or blocked in 5% non-fat milk diluted in Tris-buffered saline with 0.05% Tween 20 (TBS-Tw) overnight at 4\u00b0C and incubated for 1 hour with human sera diluted 1:50 in TBS-Tw. the chromogenic reaction was developed using a substrate solution containing diamino human sera of individuals from endemic areas recognize P. orientalis SGH Human sera (303 samples) were tested in duplicates with SGH of P. orientalis. the ELISA cut-off value was calculated from 18 negative controls. sYEL1 and sAG5 stands for salivary yellow-related protein 1 and salivary antigen 5-related protein, respectively. Molecular weights (kDa) of standard (STD; Benchmark Protein Ladder, ThermoFisher Scientific) are indicated. mYEL1 and mAG5 were tested by ELISA with 20 human serum samples covering the range of anti-SGH positivity/negativity. all proteins were tested in single concentration and sera dilution. mYEL1 correlated well with antibody reaction against SGH in both sera dilutions. Western blot analysis was performed for four human sera samples. AB stands for recombinant protein strip stained by amidoblack. ELISA with mYEL1 and mAG5 IgG antibody response against SGH was compared.
