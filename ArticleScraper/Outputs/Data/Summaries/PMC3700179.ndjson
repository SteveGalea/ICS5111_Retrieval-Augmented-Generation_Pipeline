{"summary": "a hitherto unknown coronavirus was isolated from the sputum of a patient with acute pneumonia and renal failure (1, 2). the isolate was provisionally called human coronavirus Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) (3). in September 2012, the same type of virus, named human coronavirus England 1, was recovered from a patient with severe respiratory illness who had been transferred from the Gulf region of the Middle East to London, United Kingdom (4). the novel virus is a representative of a new, yet-to-be-established species in lineage C of the genus Betacoronavirus. the novel virus seems most closely related to as-yet-unclassified viruses from insectivorous European and African bats in the Vespertilionidae and Nycteridae families. a single variant from a spectrum of related betacoronaviruses in bats successfully crossed over to and rapidly established itself in (an) intermediate animal host species. such spillover events would be facilitated through frequent intermediate host-human interactions. the obvious concern is that the virus may take the next step and adapt to efficient human-to-human transmission. ages A through D (corresponding to former CoV subgroups 2A through D) bootstrap values are indicated at branch points. the tree is drawn to scale (scale bar, 0.2 amino acid substitutions per site) new coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is endorsed by the discoverers of the virus. at least for the time being."}
