{"summary": "arenavirus genomes are bi-segmented, with one large (L) segment of around 7.2 kb and one small (S) segment of around 3.4 kb. each segment contains two open reading frames (ORFs) encoding two gene products in opposite orientation. the two ORFs are separated by a highly structured intergenic region (IGR) that functions to terminate viral RNA transcription. the old world (OW) arenaviruses and the new world (NW) arenaviruses are separated into two groups based on geography and phylogeny. the prototypic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is also classified as an OW arenavirus. Clade B contains all the pathogenic NW arenaviruses, including Junn (JUNV) and Machupo viruses. most infections occur in a rural setting, often during cyclical outbreaks. OW and NW arenaviruses are responsible for significant human disease. LF can have case fatality rates ranging from 9.3\u201318% among hospitalized patients. highly pathogenic OW and NW arenaviruses cause severe diseases in humans, but the innate immune responses are remarkably different. despite high unchecked levels of viremia, severe LF cases are generally characterized by profound immunosuppression, including a weak or delayed Type I interferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokine response. high levels of serum IFN/pro-inflammatory cytokines are observed in fatal cases of AHF. survival is correlated with lower levels of IFN/cytokines, which decrease as viremia subsides. pathogenic OW and NW arenavirus infections also induce adaptive immune responses. mDC activation and the IFN response are remarkably reduced and delayed in LASV infection. mDC activation and the IFN-I response in MOPV infection are increased and prolonged. it is also unclear if other cell types, e.g., NK cells, might be present in the coculture. a LF chimeric mouse model has been developed and reproduces the main symptoms of LF. a chimeric mouse model in which wild-type bone marrow cells are transplanted into irradiated type I interferon receptor knockout mice has been developed. this model reproduces the main symptoms of LF, highlighting the dual activity of the T-cell response during LF. dsRNA molecules may be produced during viral RNA synthesis. this may trigger a signaling cascade that leads to a Type I interferon (IFN-I) response. the nucleoprotein (NP) exonuclease (ExoN) efficaciously degrades dsRNA. a recent imaging study has revealed dsRNA accumulation during JUNV infection [54]. the dsRNA signals co-localize with the PRRs RIG-I and PKR as well as melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA-5), strongly suggesting that these dsRNAs are recognized by and activate PRRs. pathogenic OW LASV has seemingly evolved the ability to evade the RIG-I response. a recent screen of genes upregulated during NW arenavirus infection identified elevated IFN and ISG gene expression (including RIG-I) during both non-pathogenic NW Tacaribe virus (TCRV) and the Candid#1 vaccine strain of JUNV [61] infections. the influence of NP on RIG-I function is still unknown. PKR is ubiquitously expressed in cells and can be further transcriptionally induced by IFN. PKR undergoes autophosphorylation and becomes enzymatically activated. PKR then phosphorylates the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2), leading to translational shutoff. NP interacts with PKR in candid#1 infected cells [54,66]. the non-pathogenic TCRV also induces PKR activation and phosphorylation of eIF2. NP exoN is highly conserved among all arenaviruses. NPs of pathogenic arenavirus have been demonstrated to block IRF3 and NF-B activation. but the IRF3 pathway does not appear to be completely blocked during NW arenavirus infection. NPs of non-pathogenic and pathogenic arenaviruses sometimes have similar anti-IFN activities. arenaviral NP inhibits the PACT-enhanced, RIG-I-mediated IFN response by disrupting PACT and RIG-I interaction. NPs of various arenaviruses (LASV, JUNV, MACV, TCRV, and PICV) interact with the host ATP-dependent RNA helicase. replication of LCMV, LASV, and JUNV was substantially impaired in DDX3 knockout cells. two different mechanisms have been proposed for the proviral effect of DDX3. DDX3 may act to suppress IFN production and facilitate LCMV infection. arenavirus Z protein has also been implicated as a suppressor of the host innate immune response. work will be needed to study role of Z protein in modulating host immune response. role of autophagy during arenavirus infection is unknown. OW and NW arenaviruses may use components of autophagy pathway. several viral proteins have been demonstrated to interact directly with key components of the autophagy pathway. the biological significance of viral protein interaction with components of autophagy remains unknown. pathogenic arenaviruses may subvert the host immune response. a chimeric MACV expressing the GPC from candid#1 JUNV is highly attenuated in a mouse model. this protection correlates with high titers of MACV-specific neutralizing antibody before challenge. a recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus vector expressing the LASV GPC efficaciously protects NHPs from lethal LASV challenge through cell-mediated immunity. vector expressing LASV G1 and G2 confers protection from lethal LASV challenge. protection is very likely through cell-mediated immunity as vaccinia virus induces the cellular immune response predominantly. neurological symptoms are common during NW arenavirus infection. knockout mice infected with clinical LASV isolates develop sensorineural hearing loss, though tissue damage was only observed in the STAT1 knockout mice concomitant with profound CD3-positive lymphocytic infiltration. a study using guinea pigs as a model for LASV infection determined that anterior uveitis was common during both fatal and nonfatal LASV infections. arenaviral NP and Z proteins are capable of interfering with PRR activation and blocking innate immune signaling in expression studies. differences in the innate immune response likely account for the differences seen in the adaptive response to hemorrhagic fever-causing arenaviruses."}
