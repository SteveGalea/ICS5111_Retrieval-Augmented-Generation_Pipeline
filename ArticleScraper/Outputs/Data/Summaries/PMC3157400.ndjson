{"summary": "clinical observations are of little help to recognise myxovirus infection. the limited use of molecular tools underestimate the role of other common pathogens. a clinical and virological survey was conducted in adult and paediatric patients with ILI referred to two french University hospitals in Paris and Tours. a network of 1300 general practitioners, \u201cR\u00e9seau Sentinelles\u201d, provides real-time clinical data used to evaluate regional and national influenza spreading. the criteria used by this network are the occurrence of a sudden fever above 39\u00b0C with myalgia and respiratory signs. in general no formal viral diagnosis is carried out. s involved in ILI during the early weeks of the 2009\u20132010 H1N1v diffusion in France (weeks 35 through 44) and describe the associated symptoms in paediatric and adult populations. s involved in ILI during the early weeks of the 2009\u20132010 H1N1v diffusion in France. a cluster of suspected influenza infections was defined as at least three possible cases in a week in a closed community (household, school,...) from week 35 (last week of August) to 44 (last week of October), 413 endonasal swabs were collected in 3 ml of universal transport medium. the two microbiology laboratories participated in the reference laboratories network for the detection of pandemic influenza H1N1v. pandemic H1N1v infection was diagnosed by real-time reverse transcription\u2013PCR (RT-PCR) assay on a 7500 Real Time PCR System. other respiratory infections were investigated by a multiplex molecular assay. the test allows the detection and differentiation of 14 respiratory viruses. the CDC real time RT-PCR assay was negative for H1N1 and the RespiFinder19\u00ae assay was positive for Influenza A. if this latter assay was negative, H3N2 typing was performed as previously described. influenza-like illness (ILI) was defined as a patient suffering from at least one general symptom (fever above 38\u00b0C, asthenia, myalgia, shivers or headache) a cluster of suspected influenza infections was defined as at least three possible cases in a week in a closed community. the two microbiology laboratories participated in the reference laboratories network for the detection of pandemic influenza H1N1v. the two microbiology laboratories participated in the reference laboratories network for the detection of pandemic influenza H1N1v. a multiplex molecular assay based on the Multiplex Ligation-dependent Probe-Amplification (MLPA) technology (RespiFinder19\u00ae, Pathofinder, Maastricht, The Netherlands) allows the detection and differentiation of 14 respiratory viruses, including influenza virus A (InfA), influenza virus B (InfB), rhinovirus (RHV), parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4 (PIV-1 to PIV-4), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a quantitative variables are presented as medians, 25th and 75th percentiles. to compare those variables according to the viral infection status, a Chi square trend test was used. analysis was performed using R.2.10.1 statistical package. the epidemic status of H1N1v was proclaimed in france by health authorities during the second week of September (black arrow) Detection of other respiratory pathogens during weeks 35 through 44 All 413 nucleic acid extracts were analyzed using the RespiFinder19\u00ae assay. 68 patients (16.5%) were then positive for H1N1v, one for H3N2 and 212 for non influenza pathogens. rhinovirus (62.6%, 119 patients), parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4 (24.2%, 46 patients), adenovirus (5.3%, 10 patients), human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63. co-detection or multi-detection were very frequent along with adenovirus infection (50% [10/20]), PIV infection (37.0% [27/73] including mixed infections with several types and less frequently with rhinovirus infection (15.6% [22/141]). emergence of H1N1v cases was associated with a rapid decline of RHV rate of infection from 50\u201360% down to less than 20%. all viruses involved in the co-infections were counted individually. 124 of the 413 patients (30.0%) were less than 15 years old (4 in SLS and 120 in TRS) and 281 patients (68.0%) were under 40 years of age (68 in SLS and 213 in TRS) children younger than 15 years of age were infected by at least one respiratory pathogen. 70.6% (48/68) of cases were identified in patients under 40 years old. no case was observed in patients older than 65 years. at the time of medical attention, 383 standardized clinical questionnaires were collected out of 413 patients. four of them could not be exploited because they were too incomplete. most patients have fever (93.9%) and cough (86.1%). 25 (50.0) 60 (57.1) 55 (62.5) 0.37 w/o 103 (42.4) 25 (50.0) 45 (42.9) 33 (37.5) NA 160 18 108 44 Myalgia w/ 195 (58.4) 28 (52.8) 98

multiplex assay because of RT-PCR inhibitors. if p value is significant (0.05), patients positive for H1N1v are compared with patients positive for other respiratory pathogens (**) and with patients without any detection of respiratory pathogens (**). we also compared clinical symptoms observed in patients with a single infection by RHV or by H1N1v. there was no difference except that rhinitis and pharyngitis were significantly more frequent in RHV infection (62.7% vs. 34.1% [p = 0.006] and 39.0% vs. 10.0% [p = 0.001], respectively) Detection of other respiratory pathogens during weeks 35 through 44 All 413 nucleic acid extracts were analyzed using the RespiFinder19\u00ae assay. sixty six patients tested H1N1v positive with CDC real time RT-PCR assay were confirmed with the multiplex assay. three of the 347 negative samples were found positive for at least one respiratory pathogen (Figure 2). 68 patients (16.5%) were then positive for H1N1v, one for H3N2 and 212 for non influenza pathogens. rhinovirus (62.6%, 119 patients), parainfluenza viruses 1 to 4 (24.2%, 46 patients), adenovirus (5.3%, 10 patients), human coronavirus 229E, OC43 and NL63 (3.2%, 6 patients) and respiratory syncytial virus A and B (2.6%, 5 co-detection or multi-detection were very frequent along with adenovirus infection (50% [10/20]), PIV infection (37.0% [27/73] including mixed infections with several

age (68 in SLS and 213 in TRS) in both institutions, 85.5% (106/124) children younger than 15 years of age were infected by at least one respiratory pathogen (Table 2). 70.6% (48/68) of H1N1v cases were identified in patients under 40 years old (22 in SLS and 26 in TRS) and no case was observed in patients older than 65 years (Table 2). at the time of medical attention, 383 standardized clinical questionnaires were collected out of 413 patients. four of them could not be exploited because they were too incomplete. most patients have fever (93.9%) and cough (86.1%).
