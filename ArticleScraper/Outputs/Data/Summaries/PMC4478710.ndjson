{"summary": "study was conducted from 2007 to 2012, including 430 LPMWs and 418 CRs at LPMs from different geographical areas of Taiwan. participants who opposed the policy on banning live-poultry slaughtering at LPMs reported lower awareness of government prevention and control policies. LPMWs' belief in the effectiveness of vaccination to prevent human or avian influenza virus infection strikingly decreased (92.3 to 68.5 %, p 0.05) risk awareness depends on high or low pathogenicity of AIVs, working in LPMs, levels of education, age, and proximity to the sites of severe AI outbreaks. prompt and clear risk communication focusing on correct information about AIVs and the most appropriate preventive measures are important for effective prevention of human infection."}
