{"summary": "Zika virus (ZIKV) is an emergent arthropod-borne virus that belongs to the genus Flavivirus of the Flaviviridae family. this virus is primarily transmitted through the bite of the Aedes mosquito. the contribution of this transmission mode to maintaining an epidemic is unclear. most pregnant women in paran\u00e1 state suspected of having ZIKV infection were monitored. samples of tissues, such as the placenta and umbilical cord, and fetal tissues were sent to our laboratory for analysis. this study was approved by fiocruz and the Brazilian National Ethics Committee of Human Experimentation. the presence of the ZIKV genome in the samples was investigated by RT-qPCR. the presence of antibodies in the serum samples was screened with an ELISA. RNA extraction and viral genome detection Viral RNA was isolated from 140 L of biological fluids. KV genome was detected according to the protocol of Lanciotti et al. (Lanciotti et al., 2008), which used 5 L of RNA per 20 L reaction, while the dengue virus (DENV) serotypes were detected according to the protocol of Johnson et al. 73 placental samples of other etiologies were tested using anti-ZIKV MAb. RT-qPCR yielded negative results in most of these samples. slides from placental disc, one slide from chorioamniotic membrane and one slide from umbilical cord were observed with an OlympusTM BX50 optical microscope. photomicrographs were acquired in a high-power field (400) using a Zeiss Axio Scan.Z1TM scanner. 331 pregnant women exhibiting ZIKV infection-compatible symptoms presented to the public health units in paran\u00e1 state. 39 cases were laboratory-confirmed for ZIKV by RT-PCR. from the positive cases, two patients had spontaneous abortions, and the remaining 37 women were monitored during pregnancy until the time of delivery. RNA extraction from unfixed placenta or viscera was performed with a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) RNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues was extracted using the ReliaPrepTM FFPE Total RNA Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, USA) a humanized anti-flavivirus monoclonal antibody (MAb) was provided by the CDC. serum samples were also tested for anti-DENV antibodies using either the Panbio Dengue IgM Capture ELISA or the Panbio Dengue IgG Indirect ELISA. 73 placental samples of other etiologies were tested by IHC using anti-ZIKV MAb. negative controls were obtained either by omitting the primary antibody from the incubation step or by using an unrelated MAb as the primary antibody. for each case, 30 high-power fields (HPFs = 400) were randomly selected. the knots and sprouts in each field were counted. the Zika-infected and uninfected control groups were compared using the Mann Whitney test.

Hofbauer cells positive for anti-ZIKV MAb inside the chorionic villi. eight of 23 third trimester human placental tissue samples exhibited pathological features in routine H&E-stained sections. most prevalent alteration was delayed villous maturation with additional stromal changes, such as hyperplasia of HCs (75%), as shown in Table 2. IKV during the third trimester showed increased numbers of HCs. a significant increase in the number of placental sprouts was observed in the groups whose mothers were infected with ZIKV during the pregnancy and from negative controls. the cytotrophoblast (CTB) and syncytiotrophoblast (STB) cells (chorion frondosum), as well as the fibroblastic cells and Wharton's jelly, were negative in all specimens. all umbilical cord (fibroblasts, Wharton's jelly, and amniotic epithelium), chorioamniotic membrane (capsular decidua, amniotic epithelium, and smooth the capsular decidua (*), the smooth chorion above the capsular decidua (arrowhead) and the amniotic epithelium (arrow) are negative for the antibody used. the cytotrophoblast and syncytiotrophoblast cells, as well as fibroblastic cells inside Wharton's jelly, are negative for the antibody used. both reports detected chorionic villi with calcification, fibrosis, perivillous fibrin deposition, patchy intervillositis and focal villitis in the cases that presented pathological signs. syncytial sprouts are markers of trophoblast proliferation; they are seen frequently during early pregnancy and are increased in many diseases. HCs were the only ZIKV-positive fetal cells in the naturally infected human placental samples examined in this study. it is noteworthy that even in the tissue samples from women infected in late pregnancy, HCs remain persistently infected until the time of delivery. a double-labeling assay showed the association of Sprouty proteins (implicated in villus branch morphogenesis) with HCs. the first trimester placenta with villitis (LRV/15 572) exhibited ZIKV-positive maternal inflammatory cells in the intervillous space. we speculate that maternal or other fetal cells may be infected only transiently. the maternal HIV infection could have contributed to the permissiveness of other maternal/placental cell types to ZIKV infection. however, the maternal HIV infection could have contributed to the permissiveness of other maternal/placental cell types to ZIKV infection. eight of the pregnant women described in Table 1 had ZIKV infection confirmed by RT-qPCR in the serum sample during the acute phase of infection. however, no viral RNA/protein was detected in placental samples from nine women who had an onset of ZIKV clinical symptoms during the first, second or third trimester. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest. the supplementary material for this article can be found online at: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2018.02266/full#supplementary-material."}
