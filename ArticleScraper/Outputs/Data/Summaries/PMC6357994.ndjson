{"summary": "Lassa virus (LASV) was originally isolated from a nurse (Lily Pinneo; strain LP) in 1969 during a nosocomial outbreak in a mission hospital in the city of Jos in north-central Nigeria 1. morphological similarities with the prototypic arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) 3, 4. persistently infected Mastomys natalensis is the main source of natural LA LASV-endemic areas cover about 80% of Sierra Leone (SL) and Liberia, 50% of Guinea, 40% of Nigeria, 30% of each of each of Ivory Coast, Togo, and Benin. west africa is undergoing rapid demographic and environmental changes that are likely to increase LASV spillover events in coming decades 10. phylogenetic analysis revealed that LASV sequences clustered geographically independently of a rodent or human source. lineages I\u2013III comprise LASV strains isolated in different geographic areas of Nigeria. a lineage V, which has a sister relationship with lineage IV, has been proposed for LASV isolates from Mali and Ivory Coast 39, 42. the LASV/JOS (lineage IV) and LASV/803213/74/H (lineage II) are highly pathogenic for strain 13 guinea pigs 45\u2013 49. however, the prototypic LASV/LP (lineage I) does not cause fatal disease in these animals 48. infection of common marmosets with LASV/803213 (lineage II) induced fatal hepatitis clinically and histologically similar to hepatitis caused by LASV/JOS (lineage IV) 66. positively stained brown spots in liver tissues of LASV-infected marmosets are indicated by arrows. Tissues of mock-infected marmosets were negatively stained on these markers. low levels of IL-6, IL-10, CD40L, AST, ALT, alkaline phosphatase, and blood urea nitrogen in LF patients from SL correlated with survival. LF is characterized by severe pulmonary edema and acute respiratory distress, and signs of encephalopathy are observed with coma and seizures 28. analysis of 2017\u20132018 Nigerian LASV strains did not reveal differences in LASV genetic lineages or the epidemiology of the disease compared with previous years 68, 69. 80% of individuals who experienced deafness had LASV-specific antibodies versus 19% of matched controls 22, 70, 71. a recent study documented the presence of severe vascular lesions in inner ear tissues 73. only one of three predicted cross-reactive HLA-A2-restricted LASV-GPC CD8 + T-cell epitopes is shared between LASV/JOS (lineage IV) and LASV/GA391 (lineage III), and CD8 + T cells from transgenic mice did not recognize GA391-derived GPC epitopes 85. studies with reassortant ML29 provided the first evidence supporting the feasibility of a pan-LASV vaccine. ML29 is safe and immunogenic and induces broad T-cell-mediated cross-protective immunity. in west africa, LF-endemic areas also have high HIV seroprevalence. 98, 99, ML29 86, 87, yellow fever 17D 100, 101, and alphavirus replicons 102, 103 have been tested in proof-of-concept studies in NHPs. ML29 exhibits unique features to meet WHO TPP criteria. rVSV/LASV-GPC has been recommended for accelerated vaccine development by international vaccine experts 104. Vaccine candidate LASV vaccine antigen formulation Vaccine regimen Efficacy against LASV/JOS a Efficacy against LASV/NIG b Viremia after challenge c Correlates of protection Ref Recombinant vaccinia virus GPC (JOS) NP GPC&NP Single vaccination, at four sites, total 1x10 9 PFU, ID 88% 20% 100% ND Low\u2013moderate High LD CMI 50, 74, 95, 109 Re b Nigerian strain of 803213 (lineage II) was used in vaccination/challenge experiments with ML29 vaccine in marmosets. this strain causes fatal disease mimicking LF human hepatitis. r3ML29/EGFP grows to high titers in vero cells. cells were infected and virus titers in tissue culture were determined. rML29 reverse genetics is an advanced vaccine platform to further improve the safety and immunogenicity of Lassa virus vaccine candidates. the rVSVG/LASV-GPC immunization did not induce detectable levels of T-cell responses before challenge. low humoral responses in IgG enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were found in three out of four vaccinated animals. CEPI supports the development of vaccine candidates from the late pre-clinical stage to phase II. rVSVG/LASV-GPC is based on the same platform applied to design the rVSVG/ZEBOV-GP vaccine, which was tested in a ring vaccination trial in Guinea 119, 120. clinical studies documented side effects associated with the rVSVG-based vaccine. the attenuated rVSV-N4CT1 vector was immunogenic in NHPs. it induced only a mild inflammatory response after intra-thalamic inoculation 125. there are no peer-reviewed pre-clinical data in support of the LASV vaccine based on the VesiculoVax platform. attenuated vaccine against Argentine hemorrhagic fever 131 provides a guideline for LASV vaccine clinical development. multicenter trials in several endemic areas would probably be required to evaluate the cross-protective efficacy of vaccine candidates. pre-existing LASV immunity potentially affects vaccine dose-dependent responses, and appropriate efforts must be applied during human trial design. the CEPI LASV vaccine portfolio is based on different features of vaccine platforms rather than the natural history of the disease and rational vaccine design. the head-to-head comparison of LASV candidates in validated NHP models seems a very reasonable step before going into expensive clinical phase II trials 93. this comparison, combined with phase I safety data, will provide very valuable information for further clinical development to target different groups at risk in endemic areas of West Africa."}
