{"summary": "the oriental armyworm, Mythimna separata (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), is an important agricultural pest in Asia and Australia. the larvae of the armyworm can inflict devastating damage to more than 104 species of plants in 16 families including food crops. an ideal reference gene should be expressed at a constant level in samples from various cells, tissues, developmental stages, or treatment conditions. RT-qPCR normalization requires validation of specific reference genes for each species and experimental background. in the current paper, 10 commonly used reference genes were examined in M. separata to normalize RT-qPCR data. the expression profile of protein kinase G gene (PKG) was applied to further validate the selected reference genes. this will facilitate future researches on gene regulation involved in M. separata migration. larval Tissues Four larvae tissues (brains, epidermises, fat bodies, and alimentary canals) were obtained from second day larvae of 5th instar stage. each sample was repeated three times, 15 larvae in each repetition. first-strand cDNA was synthesized from 1 g of total RNA. synthesized cDNA was stored at 80\u00b0C.

EF and TBP were the least stable genes identified by four programs. according to the lowest pairwise variation appearing at V5/6, five genes are proposed as reference genes for normalization. the correlation of NF values between NF3 and NF5 was analyzed. this result supports that the three most stable reference genes may meet an accurate normalization for all biotic samples. geNorm Normfinder BestKeeper Ct Stability Rank Stability Rank Stability Rank Stability Rank Photoperiod GAPDH 0.179 1 1.657 6 0.58 4 1.97 4 18S 2.504 10 5.034 10 5.08 10 5.07 10 28S 1.863 9 3.608 9 3.94 9 3.96 9 EF 0.581 6 0.059 1 0.27 2 1.82 1 RPL12 0.293 4 1.188 4 0.25 1 1.83 2 -TUB 0.238 3 0.30 2 1.81 1 RPL12 0.471 4 0.917 4 0.29 1 1.82 2 -TUB 0.938 7 0.160 1 0.81 5 2.00 5 ATPase 1.084 8 0.160 2 0.93 7 2.08 7 TBP 0.557 5 2.184 8 1.21 8 2.36 8 -ACT 0.350 1 1.760 7 0.88 6 2.07 6 CypA > 28S > 18S. -TUB, EF, and ATPase were the most stable genes. -ACT and CypA determined by geNorm were the most stable genes. -TUB and ATPase recommended by NormFinder were the most stable genes. all pairwise variation values exhibited by geNorm were above the proposed 0.15 cut-off value. the value at V5/6 was lowest in all pairwise variations. five are proposed as reference genes for normalization. a broad range of CT values from 10.71 (28S) to 25.91 (TBP) in RT-qPCR exhibited all reference genes expression levels across all treatments. EF (mean CT value) and 28S (mean CT value) were expressed at the highest levels and EF (mean CT value) and TBP (mean CT value) at the lowest levels. the lowest pairwise variation was shown at V6/7. so, six genes are recommended as reference genes for normalization. it is relatively impractical to use excessive numbers of endogenous control genes for normalization.

EF and TBP determined by BestKeeper were the most stable genes. the most stable genes identified by geNorm were EF, -TUB, and CypA. the stability ranking of the reference genes from the most stable to the least stable gene across photoperiod was as follows: EF > RPL12 > GAPDH > CypA > -ACT > -TUB > ATPase > TBP> 28S > 18S. the first V-value 0.15 showed at V2/3 (Figure 3a) suggesting that two reference genes were sufficient for reliable normalization. NormFinder showed that -TUB, ATPase, and -TUB were the most stable genes. 28S and 18S determined by the four programs were the least stable genes. -TUB >EF > ATPase > -ACT > TBP > 28S > 18S. analysis showed that the pairwise variation values of V5/6, V6/7, and V7/8 were the cut-off value of 0.15. the correlation of NF values between NF3 and NF5 was calculated. it supports that the three most stable reference genes may suit an accurate normalization for temperature treatments. the most stable genes identified by geNorm were GAPDH, -TUB, and CypA. those identified by NormFinder were EF, -ACT, and ATPase. the four programs revealed 18S and 28S to be the least stable genes. temperature GAPDH 0.704 5 1.396 5 0.77 5 1.96 4 18S 2.689 10 5.316 10 4.99 10 5.36 10 28S 2.021 9 5.064 9 4.79 9 5.17 9 EF 0.43 3 0.173 3 0.21 1 1.86 2 RPL12 0.537 4 0.669 4 0.33 3 1.85 1 -TUB 0.181 1 0.09 1 0.32 2 1.94 3 ATPase 0.181 1 0.09 2 0.43 4 2 the gene stability ranking from the most stable to the least stable across temperature was as follows: -TUB >EF > ATPase > RPL12 > GAPDH > CypA > -ACT > TBP > 28S > 18S. the geNorm analysis showed that the pairwise variation values of V5/6, V6/7, and V7/8 were the cut-off value of 0.15. pairwise variation values of V2/3, V3/4, and V4/5 calculated by the geNorm were below the proposed 0.15 cut-off value. -TUB, EF, and CypA were the most stable genes. 18S and 28S were identified by the four programs as the least stable genes.
