{"summary": "the first study in the medical literature reporting the acute physical and psychological symptoms of the general population during a haze crisis. results A total of 298 participants returned the completed study questionnaire. the respondents reported a mean number of 4.03 physical symptoms. the first serious episode occurred in 1997 when farmers adopted the \u2018slash- and-burn\u2019 technique to prepare land for agricultural use. the burning of carbon-rich peatland would send off acrid smoke, dust and dry particles (2.5 micrometers or smaller) into the atmosphere. recurrence of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation phenomenon has also contributed to the particularly dry season. the haze spread eastwards and the air quality index started to deteriorate gradually. the PSI reached a hazardous level of 321 at 10 pm on June 19 2013 and the highest level of 401 on June 21. this led to a massive rush amongst Southeast Asians to stock up on the masks. study explored immediate physical and psychological symptoms among the general population who experienced haze during the 2013 Southeast Asian Haze Crisis. participants were recruited by snowball sampling through sponsored online recruitment posted on a commonly used online social network with a direct link to the online questionnaire. participants consented online before participation. IES-R is a 22-item self-administered questionnaire on physical symptoms. participants rated on range of dangerous PSI values, personal possession and perceived usefulness of the N-95 mask on 5-point Likert scales. participants were classified into two groups based on perceived dangerous PSI value. the average (250) of the minimum (0) and maximum (500) PSI value was used as a cut-off (i.e. 250 vs > 250) 71(23.8) 31(25.8) 40(22.5) 0.297 39(21.9) 32(26.7) 0.345 \u2022 Others: Single, divorced, widow 227(76.2) 89(74.2) 138(77.5) 139(78.1) 88(73.3) Occupation \u2022 Students 150(50.3) 65(54.2) 85(47.7) 0.486 88(49.4) 62(51.7) 0.893 \u2022 Working indoor 54.5) 53(44.2) 0.080 Dizziness 74(24.8) 25(20.8) 49(27.5) 0.190 51(28.7) 23(19.2) 0.063 Eye discomfort 181(60.7) 63(52.5) 118(66.3) 0.017 111(62.4) 70(58.3) 0.485 Nose discomfort 191(64.1) 84(70.0) 107(60.1) 0.081 122(68.5) mean intrusion score mean (SD) 0.96(0.63) 0.94(0.62) 0.98(0.64) 0.671 1.03(0.63) 0.87(0.61) 0.029 Mean hyper-arousal score mean (SD) 0.85(0.74) 0.84(0.74) 0.86(0.75) 0.889 0.94(0.73) 0.72(0.76) 0.013 Total IES-R score mean (SD) 18.47(11.69) 18.19(11.73) 18.65(11.69) 18.65(11. women were more likely to report usefulness of the mask (X2 = 7.353, df = 1, p = 0.007) and the presence of eye discomfort (X2 = 5.718, df = 1, p = 0.017) there were no significant differences between men and women in demographics variables. the total number of physical symptoms was positively associated with the mean avoidance score (B = 0.048, SE = 0.011, R2 = 0.061, p 0.001), mean intrusion score (B = 0.075,SE = 0.013, R2 = 0.095, p 0.001), mean hyper-arousal score (B = 0.130, SE = 0.015, R2 = 0.207, p 0.001), total mean IES-R score (B = 0.021 0.063 0 0.740 -0.460 1.383 0 0.740 Ethnicity 0.046 0.087 0.001 0.600 0.009 0.110 0 0.936 -0.031 0.130 0 0.810 0.011 0.092 0 0.902 0.250 2.033 0 0.902 Marital status -0.004 0.068 0 0.958 0.092 0.086 0.004 0.284 0.064 0.101 0.00 6 0.199 -1.849 1.435 0.006 0.199 Perceived usefulness of N-95 mask 0.045 0.133 0 0.733 0.173 0.167 0.004 0.300 0.230 0.198 0.005 0.247 0.142 0.141 0.003 0.314 3.130 3.102 0.003 0.314 Total number of physical symptoms 0.048 0.011 0.061 0.001 0.075 0.013 0.095 0.001 0.130 0.015 0.207 study also found female gender and smoking habits were important factors influencing susceptibility to respiratory symptoms during the Winnipeg air pollution crisis. haze is not associated with acute stress reaction syndrome in the general population but associated with mild to moderate psychological stress. local government played a key role in reducing the psychological stress. inverse association between perceived dangerous PSI values and mean scores of intrusion, hyper-arousal and overall psychological stress suggests that people who have lower threshold for health hazard are vulnerable to greater psychological stress when air quality deteriorates. the low threshold for health hazard and the number of physical symptoms independently determine psychological stress and these factors may contribute to anticipatory anxiety. the 2013 haze crisis was a temporary perturbation on the ecosystem which lasted for one week. we could only study the acute physical symptoms and psychological stress. this is also a common limitation in studies conducted during an outbreak of infection. our findings provide guidance to the health authorities to focus on reducing physical symptoms. it is important to note that the perceived dangerous PSI value, not the actual PSI level, is associated with negative psychological stress. regional organization such as the ASEAN should formulate and reinforce policies to prevent future illegal burning in farms and plantations.
