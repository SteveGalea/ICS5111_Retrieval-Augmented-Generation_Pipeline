{"summary": "in artificial vesicles, lipid domain formation is detected when high-Tm (melting temperature) lipids (meaning a high gel-to-liquid melting temperature in vesicles composed of a single lipid), low-Tm lipids, and cholesterol are mixed (5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11) interleaflet coupling can promote or disturb ordered-domain formation or lipid packing in a leaflet lacking high-Tm lipids. interleaflet coupling in asymmetric vesicles can influence ordered domain formation. in some cases lipid domains are only able to form nanoscopic domains. lipid compositions can be visualized by microscopy. dylcholines or SM showed that high-Tm lipid acyl-chain length and mole fraction determine the extent to which the inner leaflet could inhibit outer-leaflet ordered-domain formation. this has implications for how cells could control ordered-domain/raft formation. 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene p-toluenesulfonate was purchased from Molecular Probes. 1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH), (2-hydroxypropyl)--cyclodextrin (HPCD), tryptophan (Trp) and sodium hydrosulfite (sodium dithionite) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich 1.5 moles unlabeled lipids were mixed and then dried under nitrogen. then lipids were dispersed at 70\u00b0C for 5 min in 300 L phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 28% (w/w) sucrose (dissolved in water) for FRET and fluorescence anisotropy measurements. 10.4 moles of unlabeled lipid composed of DMPC, DPPC, mSM, DMPC/DOPC, di C15:0 PC/DOPC, DPPC/DOPC, or SM (bSM or mSM):DOPC were dried under nitrogen followed by high vacuum for at least 1 h. they were then hydrated with 162.5 L of 420 mM HPCD and diluted with 487.5 L PBS at 70\u00b0C in a water 500 L of 16 mM donor MLVs and 500 L of 8 mM acceptor LUVs were mixed. after vortexing, the donor-acceptor vesicle mixtures were overlaid onto 3.5 mL of a 15\u201317% (w/w) sucrose solution (15% for mSM/DOPC, bSM/DOPC, and mSM donor vesicles; 16% for DMPC/DOPC, Di C15:0 fluorescent molecules were incorporated into donor or acceptor vesicles. for inner-leaflet anisotropy studies, acceptor vesicles contained 0.2 mol% TMADPH. an extra 10 mol% Rho-DOPE was added to donor or acceptor vesicles. the initial percent of Rho-DOPE in the donor lipid mixture was varied. there was no difference in ordered-domain thermal stability when the initial percent of Rho-DOPE in the donor lipid mixture was varied. s composed of 1:1 DMPC:DOPC, 1:1 di C15:0 PC:DOPC, 1:1 DPPC:DOPC, 2:1 DSPC/DOPC, or at ratios varying from 1:3 to 2:1 SM (bSM or mSM):DOPC. for FRET measurements, \u201cF samples\u201d with Rho-DOPE and \u201cFo samples\u201d without Rho-DOPE were prepared. the value of FRET (as given by F/Fo) was normalized at high temperature to 1 to minimize how this alters the data. this was confirmed by comparing FRET with DPH as FRET donor and Rho-DOPE as FRET acceptor for symmetric vesicles with 1 and 2 mol% Rho-DOPE. FRET with 1 and 2 mol% Rho-DOPE had very similar Tmid and Tend. the fraction of DPH fluorescence was unquenched by the rhodamine lipid. both F and Fo samples also contained 0.04 M (0.02 mol%) DPH. average (mean) and SD (only up branch shown) from three samples are shown. SDs were calculated before normalization and then scaled to normalized values. the fraction of DPH fluorescence that was unquenched by the rhodamine lipid (F/Fo) versus temperature curves is shown after normalization of (F/Fo) to 1 at high temperature (64\u00b0C) symmetric LUVs contained the same lipid composition as the outer leaflet of the AUVs. they contained (A) 75:25 bSM:DOPC (35% CHOL), (B) 60:40 bSM:DOPC (35% CHOL), (C) 45:55 bSM:DOPC (35% CHOL), and (D) 30:70 bSM:DOPC (35% CHOL) or in controls for no domain formation DOPC (35% CHOL) (d FRET measured by donor quenching is independent of donor concentration in the bilayer. Fig. S7 confirms DPH concentration in the bilayer had no significant effect on FRET. analysis of lipid composition by HP-TLC AUV samples was prepared for HP-TLC (Silica Gel 60) analysis by being dried under a nitrogen stream and then being dissolved in 1:1 chloroform/methanol (v/v) pure lipid standards, using a range of lipid amounts above and below that in the sample prepared from the AUVs, were prepared the same way. vesicle samples were dried under a nitrogen stream, dissolved in 1:1 chloroform/methanol (v/v) and loaded on preheated HP-TLC plates. the silica gel containing PC was scraped off the HP-TLC plate. concentration was roughly estimated by dry weight to prepare samples in an NMR tube. the fraction of saturated to total PCs in the sample was calculated by comparing the areas of the single proton attached to the position 2-carbon of glycerol at 5.2 ppm. the fraction of saturated to total PCs in the sample was calculated by comparing the areas of the single proton attached to the position 2-carbon of glycerol at 5.2 ppm. the estimated % contamination was 7% for DMPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL), 12% for DPPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) and 10% mSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) residual donor vesicles would contain DOPC in place of some of the saturated PC or SM, which would reduce their tendency to pellet during centrifugation. 1:1 eSM:DOPC 32.5 2.4 (n = 5) 62.5 4.6 (n = 5)

from 0.25 mol% C6-NBD-PC-labeled donor vesicles and 0.25 mol% C6-NBD-PC-labeled acceptor vesicles. labeled acceptor LUVs with 0.25 mol% C6-NBD-PC in both leaflets were also prepared. donor vesicles in both steps contained 1:1 mSM:DOPC. in the first step, donor vesicles contained DOPC with 35 mol% cholesterol. in the second step, the exchanged acceptor vesicles used were the exchanged acceptor vesicles from the first step after diluting the pellet to 500 L with PBS. the fraction of rhodamine fluorescence quenched by binding of outer-leaflet TMADPH to the MCD is given by 1 (F+/F) the fraction of TMADPH fluorescence that was quenched by binding of outer-leaflet TMADPH to the MCD is equal to 1 (F+/F). vesicle sizes were estimated with the use of the Dynamics V5.25.44 program supplied by Wyatt Technology. vesicle sizes were estimated with the use of the Dynamics V5.25.44 program supplied by Wyatt Technology. yristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) and 1-palmitoyl-2-6-[(7-nitro-2-1,3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]hexanoyl -sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (C6-NBD-PC) were purchased from Avanti Polar Lipids DPH and TMADPH were dissolved in ethanol and stored at 20\u00b0C. concentrations were determined by absorbance using = 88,000 cm1 M1 and = 74,000 cm1 M1, respectively, at 350 nm in ethanol. symmetric large unilamellar vesicles were prepared. a mixture of dry ice and acetone followed by thawing to room temperature using warm water. samples were diluted 25-fold with PBS before fluorescence measurements. donor and acceptor vesicles refer to which vesicles donate the final outer leaflet lipid in the AUVs and which accept them. mol/mol mixtures were dried as above, hydrated in 550 L of 28% (w/w) sucrose at 70\u00b0C in a water bath, then vortexed at 55\u00b0C for 15 min to form MLVs. after vortexing, the donor-acceptor vesicle mixtures were overlaid onto 3.5 mL of a 15\u201317% (w/w) sucrose solution (15% for mSM/DOPC, bSM/DO the sample washed with 3.5 mL PBS and subjected to ultracentrifugation at 189,000 g for 30 min at 23\u00b0C. the final pellet was resuspended in 500 L PBS for subsequent experiments. extra Rho-DOPE or 10 mol% Rho-DMPE included in donor vesicles. extra 4 mol% Rho-DMPE included in acceptor vesicles. exchange efficiency of Rho-DOPE using -cyclodextrins was found to be low. backgrounds that were samples without fluorescent probe had negligible intensity (1%) except for TMADPH and DPH fluorescence anisotropy measurements. measurements were made at room temperature unless otherwise noted. it should be noted that measuring FRET after lipid exchange introduces two issues not encountered when measuring FRET in ordinary lipid vesicles. the more FRET acceptor the asymmetric vesicles have, the higher the level of FRET when FRET is being measured by donor quenching, as in the experiments in this study. a twofold difference in FRET-acceptor concentration did not affect Tmid and Tend (25) this was confirmed by comparing FRET with DPH as FRET donor and Rho-DOPE as FRET acceptor for symmetric vesicles with 1 and 2 mol% Rho-DOPE. mol:mol (35 mol% CHOL), (B) 40:60 DPPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL), (C) 42:58 di C15:0 PC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL), and (D) 47:53 DMPC DOPC (35% CHOL) symmetric LUVs were prepared with (F) or without (Fo) 1 mol% (for symmetric LUVs) or 1.5 mol% (for both F and Fo samples contained 0.04 M (0.02 mol%) DPH. average un-normalized F/Fo values at high temperature were 0.37 0.06. vesicles contained entrapped 28% (w/w) sucrose inside. differences in vesicle yield could result in a different amount of FRET donor in the samples after exchange. this would require an additional measurement to determine the amount of FRET donor (DPH) in the samples. in this protocol, F and Fo samples are first prepared without DPH, and then DPH, which binds very tightly to lipids. fluorescence was measured first without TMADPH or DPH added to derive background values. then 0.1 mol% DPH or TMADPH was added and incubated for 5 min in the dark, and fluorescence was remeasured. HP-TLC plates were evenly sprayed with cupric acetate and 8% (v/v) phosphoric acid solution, dried for at least 30 min, and charred at 180\u2013200\u00b0C for 5\u201315 min. band intensity was measured by comparing band intensity in vesicle samples to that of the standards fitted to an intensity versus concentration curve. the combined supernatants were filtered through three layers of VWR qualitative filter paper. they were dried under nitrogen followed by high vacuum for at least 3 h. concentration was roughly estimated by dry weight to prepare samples in an NMR tube (Wilmad LabGlass, Buena, NJ) lipids on the HP-TLC plate included a mixture of PCs with the same composition as in the AUV lipid. the estimated % contamination was 7% for DMPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL), 12% for DPPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL), and 10% mSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) 2:1 bSM:DOPC 41.4 1.9 (n = 4) 79.6 3.7 (n = 4) mSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35%CHOL) 1:1 mSM:DOPC 32.0 1.7 (n = 6) 61.5 3.3 (n = 6) bSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35%CHOL) 1:1 bSM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35%CHOL) 1:1 bSM:DOPCo/DOPCi DOPCi (35% CHOL) DPPC 40.1 1.7 (n = 3) 77.1 3.3 (n = 3) DMPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) 1:1 DMPC:DOPC 25.0 1.8 (n = 3) 48.1 3.5 (n = 3) di C15:0 PC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) 1:1 di C15:0 PC:DOPC 22.2 1.8 (n = 3) 42.7 3.5 ( the high concentration of Rho-DOPE in donor vesicles would quench DPH fluorescence strongly. the 10\u201315 mol% of Rho-DOPE in donor MLVs quenches DPH fluorescence six- to ninefold relative to that of DPH in AUVs. the agreement with FRET indicates this was negligible. the fraction of bleached C6-NBD-PC is equal to 1 (F+/F) samples were formed using 1:1 mSM:DOPC donor vesicles and an extra 10 mol% rhodamine-labeled lipid. donor vesicles in both steps contained 1:1 mSM:DOPC. 200 L of 100 mM Trp (dissolved in PBS) was added into the cuvette. rhodamine fluorescence was immediately remeasured (F+ intensity) the fraction of rhodamine fluorescence that was quenched by Trp is given by 1 (F+/F) fluorescence intensity measured after incubation for 5 min in the dark at room temperature (F+ intensity) the fraction of TMADPH fluorescence quenched by binding of outer-leaflet TMADPH to the MCD is equal to 1 (F+/F) acceptor LUVs were prepared with a mixture of various high-Tm sphingomyelins or saturated acyl-chain PCs (mSM, bSM, eSM, DMPC, di C15:0 PC, DPPC, or DSPC) with DOPC. a high concentration of cholesterol in the acceptor LUVs was needed to obtain a substantial yield of AUVs. the fraction of high-Tm PC (DMPC, di C15:0 PC, DPPC, and DSPC) and unsaturated DOPC was calculated from the number of acyl-chain double-bond protons in the samples. the tendency is that the shorter the acyl chains of the saturated PCs, the higher the exchange efficiency. the thermal stability of ordered domains can be determined by measuring FRET versus temperature (25, 26, 37) because Rho-DOPE was localized to the outer leaflet, domain formation in the outer leaflet of AUVs was detected. symmetric LUVs had the same lipid compositions in their outer leaflets but different compositions in their inner leaflets. symmetric LUVs containing DOPC with 35 mol% cholesterol (dashed lines) were prepared to illustrate FRET in a sample in which no ordered domains were present. the behavior was compared for AUVs with different saturated PCs with acyl-chain lengths of 18 (DSPC), 16 (DPPC), 15 (diC15:0PC) or 14 (DMPC) carbon atoms as the high-Tm lipid in the outer leaflet. FRET behavior of analogous AUVs and symmetric vesicles containing DPPC, DOPC, and cholesterol. difference in Tmid appears to be 8\u00b0C. symmetric vesicles had a Tend of 45\u00b0C. cholesterol concentration in DMPC/DOPC/cholesterol vesicles was found to have very little effect on ordered-domain thermal stability. at most, only a modest destabilization of domain formation of AUVs in the absence of an osmotic gradient was observed. TMADPH was incorporated into the outer leaflet of AUVs by adding it to preformed vesicles. the maximum loss of fluorescence upon adding MCD was 80%. TMADPH in the inner leaflet should not be accessible to MCD. outer-leaflet TMADPH anisotropy in AUVs composed of DPPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) LUVs was much higher than in the disordered state. the high anisotropy in the outer leaflet of the AUVs is consistent with the presence of ordered domains that are slightly less stable than those in the symmetric vesicles. symmetric vesicles have the same overall lipid composition as the symmetric vesicles with one-half as much high-Tm lipid as in the AUVs. average (mean) and SD values from 3 samples are shown. order domain formation in the symmetric vesicles tend to be as or more thermally stable than in the AUVs. samples of AUVs were prepared with different amounts of bSM in the outer leaflet. domain formation in AUVs was again compared to that in symmetric LUVs with the same mol% bSM as in the outer leaflet of the AUVs. the destabilization of outer-leaflet ordered domains by a disordered-state inner leaflet is more pronounced at lower mol% SM. additional assays were used to confirm that after lipid exchange, the vesicles were asymmetric, and that asymmetry was stable. the fraction of C6-NBD-PC in the outer leaflet was then measured by assaying the fraction of NBD fluorescence bleached. 80\u201390% of NBD fluorescence was bleached, which means that over 80% of the C6-NBD-PC was located in the outer leaflet. the residual NBD fluorescence may reflect contamination of the AUVs with donor vesicles from the preparation procedure. a small amount of C6-NBD-PC that flipped from outer to inner leaflet did not increase significantly after 2 days preincubation. data are shown for AUVs with C6-NBD-PC in the outer leaflet. symmetric LUVs with C6-NBD-PC predominantly in the inner leaflet. vesicles were preincubated at room temperature in the dark for 2 days before NaDt addition. TMADPH reports lower membrane order than DPH. it partitions more weakly into ordered domains relative to disordered domains. difference between AUVs and LUVs with scrambled lipids confirms that the AUVs are indeed asymmetric. rhodamine lipid (Rho-DOPE or Rho-DMPE) exchanged into outer leaflet. rhodamine lipid (rho-DMPE or Rho-DMPE) removed selectively from outer leaflet by lipid exchange. rhodamine lipid does not rapidly flip between leaflets. mSM, bSM, eSM, DMPC, di C15:0 PC, DPPC, or DSPC were exchanged into the outer leaflet of the acceptor LUVs to prepare AUVs with donor lipids in the outer leaflet and acceptor lipids in the inner leaflet. a high concentration of cholesterol in the acceptor LUVs was needed to obtain a substantial yield of AUVs. 1H-NMR spectroscopy was used to assay the amount of lipid exchange. the fraction of high-Tm PC (DMPC, di C15:0 PC, DPPC, and DSPC) and unsaturated DOPC was calculated from the number of acyl-chain double-bond protons in the samples after exchange. the thermal stability of the ordered domains can be determined by measuring FRET versus temperature (25, 26, 37) because Rho-DOPE was localized to the outer leaflet, domain formation in the outer leaflet of AUVs was detected. lipid exchange levels were found to be more variable than that for unlabeled lipids. symmetric LUVs containing DOPC with 35 mol% cholesterol were prepared to illustrate FRET in a sample in which no ordered domains were present. the behavior was compared for AUVs with different saturated PCs with acyl-chain lengths of 18 (DSPC), 16 (DPPC), 15 (diC15:0PC), or 14 (DMPC) carbon atoms as the high-Tm lipid in the outer leaflet. Fig. 1 B compares the FRET behavior of analogous AUVs and symmetric vesicles. difference in Tmid appears to be 8\u00b0C. symmetric vesicles had a Tend of 45\u00b0C. the lack of ordered-domain formation in the AUVs containing DMPC is not likely to be due to a change in outer-leaflet cholesterol concentration. the movement of cholesterol between two leaflets would have to be relatively modest to maintain lipid balance between the inner and outer leaflet after exchange in the AUVs preparation. even large changes in cholesterol concentration (between 25 and 45 mol% cholesterol) were found to have very little effect on ordered-domain thermal stability. TMADPH has a cationic charge, so when added to preformed vesicles, it is only anchored to the outer leaflet (39) an extraction assay was developed to confirm that TMADPH selectively labeled the outer leaflet of AUVs. TMADPH anisotropy increased as the % saturated PC in the symmetric vesicles increased. the outer-leaflet TMADPH anisotropy in AUVs composed of DPPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) was much higher than in the disordered state. anisotropy of 75:25 DPPC:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL), symmetric DMPC/DOPC (35% CHOL), and DOPC (35% CHOL) LUVs are shown. AUVs have the same overall lipid composition as the symmetric vesicles with one-half as much high-Tm lipid as in the AUVs. ordered domains were observed in AUVs composed of SM:DOPCo/DOPCi (35% CHOL) and symmetric LUVs with the same composition as the outer leaflet. TMADPH anisotropy confirmed that the AUVs had outer leaflets that were highly ordered. the inner leaflet can destroy ordered domains by a disordered-state inner leaflet. the inner leaflet can destroy ordered domains in the outer leaflet. the inner leaflet can destroy ordered domains by a disordered-state inner leaflet. 50% of NBD fluorescence was bleached in both leaflets. the residual NBD fluorescence may be due to a small amount of C6-NBD-PC that flipped from outer to inner leaflet. the bleaching observed (20% of NBD fluorescence before preincubation) likely reflects incomplete removal of outer leaflet. vesicles (200 M lipid) contained 0.25 mol% C6-NBD-PC. symmetric LUVs with C6-NBD-PC in both leaflets were preincubated. TMADPH reports lower membrane order than DPH because it partitions more weakly into ordered domains relative to disordered domains. the difference between AUVs and LUVs with scrambled lipids confirms that the AUVs are indeed asymmetric. rhodamine lipid is asymmetrically distributed in the outer leaflet. rhodamine lipid is asymmetrically distributed in the outer leaflet. rhodamine lipid does not rapidly flip between leaflets. interleaflet coupling can have various consequences for membrane physical state. asymmetric vesicles refer to a phenomenon that occurs when there is strong coupling of physical states in two leaflets. by coupling dominance, we mean the degree to which the physical state of the inner or outer leaflet \u201cby itself\u201d is found to be the predominant physical state. if there is tight/strong interleaflet coupling, the extent of coupling is high so that the physical state of the leaflets is the same at all temperatures. there could also be partial coupling, in which the inner and outer leaflets are coupled only over a limited temperature range (model E) ed transition is dominated by low-Tm inner-leaflet lipid, and the transition temperature is close to that of outer leaflet vesicles composed of outer-leaflet lipids. in the illustrated example, there is tight interleaflet coupling of physical state, but neither leaflet dominates. in other words, this is a case in which there is no dominance of one leaflet over the other. a lack of coupling and coupling are possible, depending on lipid composition. the induction of ordered domains in one leaflet has been reported in some lipid compositions. in other cases, loosening or destruction of ordered domains has been reported. ordered domains were detected in asymmetric giant unilamellar vesicles. bSM:DOPCo/DOPCi has an acyl-chain composition that tends to form nanodomains rather than macroscopic domains in symmetric vesicles. this study illustrates the utility of FRET for detecting nanoscale lipid domains in AUVs. a disordered inner leaflet can partially fluidize ordered outer-leaflet domains via coupling (49), but contrasts with other cases in which the disordered leaflet dominates physical behavior of the outer leaflet. both shorter acyl chains and a lower fraction of high-Tm lipid are known to decrease the \u201cmelting\u201d temperature of ordered domains in a symmetric bilayer. inner- and outer-leaflet lipids could be important (16, 20) interleaflet coupling may have different coupling extent and dominance properties. lipids with the same Tm in vesicles may exhibit very different coupling extent and dominance properties. cyclodextrin-catalyzed lipid exchange seems to maintain lipid balance between leaflets. a small net deficit or surplus of outer-leaflet lipid could result from exchange. this could be balanced out by a movement of cholesterol toward the leaflet with a lipid deficit. Fig. 5 shows a range of possible variations in interleaflet coupling extent and dominance for lipid bilayers. if there is no coupling of physical state, i.e., the extent of coupling is zero or the energy of coupling is very low, the leaflets should melt close to the same temperature as they would in a bilayer composed of only outer- or only inner-leaflet lipids. ordered-to-disordered transition is dominated by low-Tm inner-leaflet lipid. transition temperature is close to that of inner leaflet vesicles composed of outer-leaflet lipids. outer leaflet dominates physical properties. asymmetric vesicles induce the formation of a partly ordered state in an opposite leaflet that by itself would form a disordered state in symmetric vesicles. the possibility of incomplete coupling in which the physical properties of lipids gradually change across the lipid bilayer also cannot be ruled out. outer-leaflet ordered domains form and are as stable or nearly as stable as those in symmetric vesicles with the same amount of SM in each leaflet as in the outer leaflet of the AUVs (17, 18). the behavior of outer-leaflet ordered domains in AUVs containing SM was consistent with our prior studies. size in symmetric LUVs may not be linked to differences in ordered-domain thermal stability. a preferential exchange of a specific acyl-chain length could alter the acyl-chain composition of the SM in the asymmetric vesicles relative to that in the original SM mixture. however, the similar levels of exchange seen with the different natural SM mixtures used suggest this would be a minimal effect. m lipid are known to decrease the \u201cmelting\u201d temperature of ordered domains in a symmetric bilayer. both factors decrease the stability of the ordered state relative to the disordered state. it is not surprising that these factors influence which leaflet dominates interleaflet coupling in the fashion observed. lipid content could have large effects on membrane domain formation in vivo. changes in protein composition and organization could also influence membrane domain formation. other open questions include the role of inner-leaflet lipid exchange."}
