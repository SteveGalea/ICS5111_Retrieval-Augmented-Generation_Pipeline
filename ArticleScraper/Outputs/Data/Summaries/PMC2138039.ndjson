Identification of new and vps Genes by sop selection gene Insertion position Remarks/reference Accession number VPS36 (2) ND; 932/1700 New gene ID by complementation 566 amino acids gb U20162_7.cds Y the number of times each sop gene was selected out of 63 sop mutants picked is indicated in parentheses. insertion site indicates the codon at which lacZ is inserted and the total number of codons in the gene. all other sop mutants are insertions within novel open reading frames. CPY is the predominant form found in wild-type and pma1-7 cells. more mature CPY is seen in lysates from the class E mutants vps27 and vps36. a chimeric membrane protein was shown previously to travel to the vacuole without arrival at the plasma membrane. invertase\u2013Wbp1\u2013Q-K chimera is increased in all vps/sop mutants. highest cell surface expression (>40% of total) is seen in vps8, and cell surface expression in the other vps/sop mutants range from 20\u201330% of total. non-vps sop mutants increase cell surface mutant Pma1. invertase activity is expressed as nmol glucose released per min per OD600. endogenous intracellular invertase activity represented 13.3% of total activity measured in the presence of the fusion protein. cell surface invertase activity is expressed as a percent of total. vps27 and vps36 suppress pma1ts in vps36. styryl dye FM 4-64 is seen as cytoplasmic punctate staining in wild-type cells. by 60 min after labeling, staining is seen predominantly at the vacuolar membrane. wild-type cells and sop mutants were stained with FM 4-64 for 5 min at 30\u00b0C. in vps36 (WLX12-7C), a class E vps mutant, FM 4-64 dye is accumulated in a prevacuolar compartment. a similar accumulation of dye as a spot near the vacuole is seen in vps38 and vps13. plasmic accumulation fails to advance in the endocytic pathway, even 60 min after internalization. it has been established that retention of membrane proteins in the late Golgi result in mislocalization of late Golgi membrane proteins. smallest halos were observed surrounding vps8 and vps36. of the vps/sop subset, only vps13 and vps38 cells produce halos of growth inhibition comparable with wild-type cells. halo assay detected secretion of biologically active mature factor. secreted factor was immunoprecipitated from the medium. the lower arrowhead indicates mature factor, a 3.5-kD peptide. the upper arrowhead indicates precursor factor with a molecular mass of 125 kD. secretion of pro\u2013 factor was detected in two non-vps sop mutants, sop2 and sop6. most of the vps/sop mutants also secrete unprocessed factor. vps36 cells secrete the highest fraction of pro\u2013 factor, consistent with production of a small halo. ex2 levels are similar in sop and wild-type cells upon deletion of PEP4. in general, mutants with less Kex2 secrete more pro\u2013 factor, and less pro\u2013 factor secretion is seen in mutants with more Kex2. in vps8 there is no reduction in steady-state Kex2 levels even though there is a severe defect in production of biologically active factor. the open reading frame of 3,323 nucleotides predicts a 1,107-amino acid polypeptide. a database search showed that Sop2 protein has high sequence similarity with synaptojanin, a nerve terminal protein with inositol 5-phosphatase (IP5P) activity. a hypothetical 108.4-kD protein on chromosome IX is in the SWISS-PROT protein sequence database under accession number P40559. protein sequences were aligned using the Megalign program (DNAStar, Madison, WI) hyphens indicate gaps introduced to maximize alignment. vps27, a class E vps mutant, was introduced into pma1-7 cells. protein from both biosynthetic and endocytic pathways are rapidly accumulated. mutant Pma1 is seen predominantly in this prevacuolar compartment when pma1-7 vps27ts cells are shifted to 37\u00b0C for 1 h. -7 vps27ts cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 1 h. mutants suppress temperature-sensitive growth of pma1-7. all sop pma1 mutants grow at both 30 and 37\u00b0C. lysate was prepared from PMA1, pma1-7, and sop pma1-7 cells exponentially growing at 30\u00b0C. lysate protein was detected using anti-Pma1 antibody and 125I\u2013protein A followed by autoradiography. mutant Pma1 staining appears coincident with vacuoles and also as perivacuolar spots, reflecting mislocalization to the endosomal/vacuolar pathway. in wild-type cells, mutant Pma1 staining appears coincident with vacuoles. five other sop mutants are identical with pep11 (Jones, 1977), mvp1 (Ekena and Stevens, 1995), vps35 (Paravicini et al., 1992), vps27 (Piper et al., 1995), and vps8. a subset of sop mutants is defective for vacuolar protein sorting. CPY secretion assay was performed on 16 sop mutants to determine if we had isolated additional vps mutants. the predicted protein sequences of VPS13, VPS36, and VPS38 were then analyzed by BLAST searches. no similarity was detected between these proteins and other protein sequences. sop selection Gene Insertion position Remarks/reference Accession number VPS36 (2) ND; 932/1700 New gene ID by complementation 566 amino acids gb U20162_7.cds YLR417w VPS13 (4) 3797; 7694; 8961; ND/9434 New gene ID by complementation 439 amino acids gb U19103_2.cds YLR360w VPS8 (1) 382/3531 1176 sop mutants were previously identified, cloned, and sequenced in other genetic screens. all other sop mutants are insertions within novel open reading frames. phenotypic characterization is in progress. sates from the class E mutants vps27 and vps36 increase surface expression of a Vacuole-directed Membrane Marker vps/sop mutants. they cause diversion of CPY and mutant Pma1 to the cell surface, suggesting a general role for these genes in regulating traffic of vacuole-bound proteins. the construct is a fusion of invertase with the transmembrane domain and vps/ sop mutants range from 20\u201330% of total. non-vps sop mutants increase cell surface mutant Pma1. but do not significantly increase plasma membrane expression of chimeric membrane marker. vertase activity was subtracted from activity measured in the presence of pEG1-QK. activity was measured in bsd2, vps36, and pep11 in the presence of vector alone. cell surface invertase activity is expressed as a percent of total. vps36 cells were labeled with FM 4-64 for 5 min. cells were then washed, and incubated for 1 h. internalized FM 4-64 is seen as cytoplasmic punctate staining in wild-type cells. in vps36 (WLX12-7C), a class E vps mutant, FM 4-64 dye is accumulated in a prevacuolar compartment. a similar accumulation of dye as a spot near the vacuole is seen in vps38 (WLX14-10A) and vps13 (WLX15-4C) membrane proteins in the late Golgi, i.e., Kex2, Kex1 and dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A are mediated by signals in their cytoplasmic domains that dictate recycling between Golgi and endosome compartments. mutants were replica-plated onto a lawn of MATa bar1 cells which undergo growth arrest in response to the concentration of mature factor secreted from each MAT cell. only vps13 and vps38 cells produce halos of growth inhibition comparable with wild-type cells. secretion of biologically active mature factor was detected by halo assay. wild-type and sop mutants were patched on plates with synthetic complete medium. a subset of sop cells secrete both unprocessed and mature factor. one of the first steps in proteolytic processing of pro\u2013 factor is Kex2-mediated removal of the pro-peptide. vps36 cells secrete the highest fraction of pro\u2013 factor, consistent with production of a small halo. vps36 cells secrete the highest fraction of pro\u2013 factor, and an approximately sixfold decrease in mating efficiency by comparison with wild-type cells. Steady-State Kex2 levels in sop Mutants Kex2p mislocalization has previously been observed in class E mutants. loss of Kex2 is not observed in mutants that have endosome-to-vacuole traffic defects. in vps8 there is no reduction in steady-state Kex2 levels even though there is a severe defect in production of biologically active factor. aptojanin is a nerve terminal protein with inositol 5-phosphatase (IP5P) activity. synaptojanin is associated with dynamin and amphiphysin. it has been proposed to play a role in synaptic vesicle endocytosis. s indicate conserved motifs GDXN(Y/F)R and P(S/ A)W(C/T)DRIL. targeting-defective pma1 mutant has provided the means to select mutants affecting the endosomal/vacuolar pathway. previously, suppression of targeting-defective pma1 resulted in identification of YPT7 (Chang, A., unpublished result) mutant Pma1 delivered to the plasma membrane appears to remain stable at the surface. it remains unknown whether wild-type Pma1 localization at the plasma membrane is maintained by cycles of endocytosis and recycling back to the cell surface. in vps13 and vps38, we observed a delay in exit of FM 4-64. this compartment appears similar to the prevacuolar compartment of class E vps cells. vps13 (soi1) was recently found in a screen for suppression of vacuolar mislocalization of a Kex2p mutant with a defective trans-Golgi localization signal. in vps8 cells, secretion of unprocessed factor is slight. steady-state Kex2 levels are also reduced, suggesting increased Kex2 degradation. vps8 cells produce a strikingly small halo. sop2 and sop6, secrete unprocessed factor and also display diminished steady-state Kex2 levels. these non-VPS SOP gene products also participate in Kex2 trafficking and play a role in the endosomal/vacuolar pathway. synaptojanin, a nerve terminus protein, is proposed to regulate synaptic vesicle endocytosis and recycling. our results suggest a role for Sop2 in trafficking between endosome and Golgi. a novel post-ER quality control mechanism recognizes and directs mutant Pma1 to the endosomal/vacuolar pathway. a corollary of this hypothesis is that plasma membrane proteins have targeting signals. different trafficking defects seen in the sop mutants suggest diverse means by which mutant Pma1 moves to the cell surface. we suggest that the sop mutants fall into three classes depending on how vacuolar delivery of mutant Pma1 is inhibited. one possible mode of sop action is a direct one, in which a defect in the mechanism directing mutant Pma1 into endosome-bound vesicles at the Golgi results in transport of mutant Pma1 mvp1, pep11, vps35, the class E mutants vps27 and vps36, and sop2 and sop6 are in this class. if there is a defect, it is possible that newly synthesized mutant Pma1 en route to the vacuole moves directly from the endosome to the plasma membrane. a pathway has not been described formally in yeast, such a pathway has been established clearly in mammalian cells. disparate defects in the endosomal system in sop mutants suggest that protein traffic to the cell surface may occur via multiple mechanisms. future studies to dissect the mechanisms of the SOP genes should aid in revealing novel means to deliver proteins to the cell surface. VPS genes, VPS13, VPS38, and VPS36 reroute a mutant Wbp1 fusion protein from the vacuole to the plasma membrane. it remains unknown whether wild-type Pma1 localization at the plasma membrane is maintained by cycles of endocytosis and recycling back to the cell surface. vps36 accumulates dye in a prevacuolar/endosomal compartment, seen as a large spot adjacent to the vacuole. in vps13 and vps38, we observed a delay in exit of FM 4-64 from an endocytic intermediate compartment. this compartment appears similar to the prevacuolar compartment of class E vps cells. vps36 cells by comparison with wild-type cells. steady-state Kex2p levels are also reduced, suggesting increased Kex2 degradation. previous suggestion that class A mutants are defective specifically in soluble protein-sorting apparatus. novel non-vps sop mutant selection of pma1 suppressors has resulted in the isolation of six novel sop mutants. of these, two sop mutants secrete unprocessed factor and also display diminished steady-state Kex2 levels. these non-VPS SOP gene products also participate in Kex2 trafficking and play a role in endosomal/vacuolar pathway. our results suggest a role for Sop2 in trafficking between endosome and golgi. a novel post-ER quality control mechanism recognizes and directs mutant Pma1 to the endosomal/vacuolar pathway. a corollary of this hypothesis is that membrane proteins without sorting signals are delivered to the vacuole in yeast. mutant Pma1 may have a defective plasma membrane targeting signal. if there is a plasma membrane targeting machinery, we would not expect SOP genes to encode these components. different trafficking defects seen in the sop mutants suggest diverse means by which mutant Pma1 moves to the cell surface. one possible mode of sop action is a direct one, in which a defect in the mechanism directing mutant Pma1 into endosome-bound vesicles at the Golgi classes may affect traffic at either the Golgi or an endosome compartment. loss of proteins required for formation of Golgi-to-endosome vesicles may slow exit from the Golgi. mutant Pma1 may escape to the surface as a consequence. factor receptor Ste3 in a class E vps mutant is consistent with endosome-to-plasma trafficking. such a pathway has been established clearly in mammalian cells."}
