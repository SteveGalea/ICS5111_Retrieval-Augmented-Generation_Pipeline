{"summary": "the receptors include the RIG-I-like receptors that are localized to the cell cytoplasm and several membrane-associated Toll-like receptors [5], [6]. Mutations in these receptors have been correlated with pathologies in viral infections in humans [7], [8], [9], [10]. innate immune receptors can interact with agonists. antimicrobial peptide LL37 and other peptides that can bind dsRNA were recently found to enhance the TLR3 response to poly(I:C) and viral dsRNAs. the proteins promoted more efficient recognition of viral dsRNAs. recombinant polymerases from the Hepacivirus genus and three viral capsid proteins were characterized in this study. de novo initiated versus primer-extended modes of RNA synthesis is regulated by a flexible loop named 1 that extends from the fingers subdomain to contact hydrophobic residues in the thumb subdomain [27]. this feature has been proposed to allow the 2a polymerase to be more efficient at RNA synthesis by the de novo initiated mechanism since it cannot initially accommodate a partially duplexed RNA. dsRNAs tested include the Reovirus genomic RNA, the S4 dsRNA made by annealing in vitro transcribed positive- and negative-sense strands of the Reovirus S4 RNA, and the Bell pepper endornavirus dsRNA, BPEV. all the RNAs were added to the media of BEAS-2B cells and the amount of cytokine IL6 secreted into the medium quantified by ELISA ml. IL6 was quantified in an aliquot of clarified cell medium. the total amount of IL6 was normalized to the total medium volume. the data shown is the mean SEM, with the number of assays in parentheses. HEK 293T cells do not detectably express TLR3 but can be transfected to express either wild-type or mutant TLR3. transfection of two plasmids, one containing an interferon stimulated response element (ISRE) promoter-driven firefly luciferase and a second encoding a constitutively expressed Renilla luciferase allow the analysis of TLR3 activation by different RNAs. only cells treated with siRNAs to TLR3 had reduced IL6 levels in the presence of BPEV dsRNA. RT-PCR confirmed that the siRNAs did knock down TLR3 mRNA levels in both untreated and poly(I:C) treated cells. EGCG, an inhibitor of RIG-I [48] had no effect on IL-6 production in the presence of poly(I:C) several highly purified RNA-binding proteins were selected to test this idea. these include the recombinant Nsp15 protein from the SARS coronavirus that binds ssRNAs [49], two versions of the Hepatitis B virus capsid protein (H-cp149 and H-cp183) [38], the capsid from the Ross River virus (R-cp) [39], the capsid from the plant-infecting Brome mosaic several recombinant proteins can enhance cytokine production by poly(I:C) each protein was present at a final concentration of 0.13 g/ml. each protein was present at a final concentration of 0.15 M. the conditions for the assay are identical to those in panel A. the 1b HCV polymerase can enhance dsRNA-induced signaling by TLR3. only the cells transfected with the siRNAs to TLR3 had reduced IL6 production compared to cells transfected with nsRNA. the presence of the polymerase did not change LPS-induced TLR4 response. siRNAs specific to TLR3 (siTLR3), RIG-I (siRIG-I) or a nonspecific control (nsRNA) were transfected into at a concentration of 30 nM into cells 48 h prior to the addition of 1b21 (0.15 M) and poly(I:C) (0.13 g/ml) to the culture medium. IL6 in the medium was collected 24 h later and quantified by ELISA. LL37 was added to a final concentration of 0.13 g/ml poly(I:C) the 1b HCV polymerase (1b21, 0.1 M), but not the 2a polymerase (2a21, 0.1 M), allowed TLR3 to produce cytokines in response to viral dsRNAs. 1b21 (0.1 M) increased IL6 levels induced by the S4 dsRNA and the BPEV dsRNA by 4 to 6-fold. 2a21 (0.1 M) was unable to enhance IL6 production when added to cells. de novo initiated RNA synthesis or extension from a primed template. template LE19P, whose 3\u2032 terminal puromycin prevents primer extension. primer extension used template PE46, which contains a partially double-stranded hairpin structure that can be extended by the polymerase. a structurally closed conformation can initiate better by a de novo mechanism. a fluorescently-labeled RNA, SL26, was used to analyze polymerase-dsRNA interactions. the proteins were mixed together with a 11 molar ratio of SL26. the gel image on the left shows the fluorescently-labeled RNA shifted above the free SL26 at the bottom of the gel. the same gel was stained with Coomassie blue to allow visualization of the proteins. the deletion of the 1 loop in the 1b polymerase makes the template channel more accessible to dsRNAs. the deletion of the 1 loop in the 1b polymerase makes the template channel more accessible to dsRNAs [27]. the HCV polymerase 1b21 co-localizes with TLR3 in endosomes. 1b21 (0.2 M) was added to the medium of cells for 1 h. NS5B is localized to acidic compartments in cells. Arginine-rich cell penetrating peptides and Vaccinia virus had been reported to enter cells by several pathways, including macropinocytosis. we tested the inhibitor 5(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)-amiloride (EIPA) on TLR3 signaling in the presence of poly(I:C) and either LL37 or recombinant 1b21. these results are consistent with macropinocytosis playing effects of three viral capsids on IL6 production by BEAS-2B cells. siRNAs to TLR3, siRNA to RIG-I, or a nonspecific target were transfected at 30 nM into the cells 48 h prior to the addition of the viral capsid proteins (50 nM) cp149 did not result in statistically significant enhancement of IL6. the amount of enhancement with the 150 nM of H-cp183 was comparable to that of 3 M LL37. the three viral CPs thus can enhance TLR3 signaling in response to both poly(I:C as well as viral dsRNAs. the RRV CP can localize to endosomes that contain TLR3. the CP can also enter barley cells through macropinocytosis. permeabilization of the cells with digitonin was required. effects of the HCV polymerases on ISRE-luciferase expression in HEK 293T cells transiently-transfected with TLR3. all recombinant proteins used were added to cell culture media to a final concentration of 100 nM. purified CPs can enhance TLR3-dependent signaling from RV dsRNA. the ratios are from ISRE-dependent firefly luciferase levels over the Renilla luciferase. the ratios are from ISRE-dependent firefly luciferase levels. IL6 levels induced by poly(I:C) were at least six-fold higher than that of dsRNAs or ssRNA (0.3 g/ml); production of IL6 in response to poly(I:C) was rapid. cells treated with S4 dsRNA did not yield level of IL6 significantly above the background even after 20 h. Activation of TLR3 was measured by the ratio of the firefly luciferase driven by an ISRE promoter element to a constitutively-expressed Renilla luciferase. each bar represents the mean value of three replicates, with the range for one standard error shown above the bars. HEK 293T cells expressing WT TLR3 responded to poly(I:C) (1\u20132 g/ml), better than viral dsRNAs (1\u20132 g/ml) purified from Reovirus and BPEV. none of RNA tested induced reporter activity in HEK 293T cells. results are consistent with those from the BEAS-2B cells. treated and poly(I:C) treated cells reduced IL6 levels in the presence of poly(I:C) to less than 20% of the control reaction. EGCG, an inhibitor of RIG-I [48] had no effect on IL-6 production in the presence of poly(I:C) the low level of cytokine production by BEAS-2B cells was due to the activation of TLR3. the cytokine induction by the various RNA-binding proteins in the absence of poly(I:C) varied depending on individual experiments. fold inductions of IL6 above basal across multiple experiments showed no statistically significance in paired T-tests. the presence of poly(I:C) (0.13 g/ml) alone induced IL6 and IL8 levels at least five-fold above background. IL6 was quantified in an aliquot of clarified cell medium. the total amount of IL6 was normalized to the total medium volume. the conditions for the assay are identical to those in panel A. the presence of the polymerase did not change the response from cells treated with only polyinosinic acid. the presence of the polymerase did not change the response from cells treated with only polyinosinic acid. this suggests specific induction of TLR3 is dependent on TLR3. IL6 production by beAS-2B cells in response to stimulation by the single-stranded polyinosinic acid (0.13 g/ml), poly(I:C) (0.13 g/ml) or lipolysaccharide (LPS) (1 g/ml), the agonist for TLR4 in the absence () or presence of 1b21 (0.15 M). the dsRNA was labeled with -32P-CTP. 1b21 is less active for RNA synthesis in vitro than the 2a21 [27], [29], [30] therefore, it is unlikely that RNA synthesis by 1b21 is responsible for the induction of TLR3 signaling. to establish this directly, we tested a catalytic mutant named GDA wherein the divalent metal-binding motif required for polymerization was mutated. 1b21 (0.1 M) increased IL6 levels induced by the S4 dsRNA and the BPEV dsRNA by 4 to 6-fold. 1b21 had only a modest increase when JFH-1 ssRNA was used as a ligand. the activation of signaling was approximately 20-fold higher with dsRNA than with JFH-1. a mutant HCV 2a polymerase can enhance TLR3 signaling. in vitro RNA synthesis by the 1b21, the 2a21 and the 2a mutant 2a.m26\u201330. final concentrations of proteins were at 40, 80, and 160 nM. a protein with such a deletion named 2a.m26\u201330 was found to be debilitated in de novo initiated RNA synthesis while retaining the ability to extend from a primed template. 2a.m26\u201331 also showed a distinct thermal denaturation profile compared to that of 2a21. a GNRA tetraloop with an 11-bp stem was used to minimize non-specific interaction by the polymerase. the RNA-protein complex was visualized with a phosphorimager and the position of the protein identified by staining with Coomassie blue. both the monomeric and dimeric forms of 2a.m26\u201330 bound SL26 better than those from 2a21. beAS-2B cells were stained with Lysotracker (Invitrogen, Inc) NS5B is localized to acidic compartments in cells. a confocal section of a cell immunostained to localize both TLR3 and 1b21 are shown in the merged image. these results are consistent with macropinocytosis playing a role in the uptake of either the dsRNA and/or the recombinant protein into endosomes. we characterized the effects of three capsid proteins (CPs) that enhanced the dsRNA-specific innate immune signaling. LL37 mimics the shortest of the Reovirus dsRNAs made by annealing in vitro transcripts of the plus- and minus-sense RNAs. RV denotes the total virion RNA purified from reovirus particles. the HBV CP contains sixteen arginines in its C-terminal thirty-four residues. it is likely that the altered interaction with RNA is responsible for the inability of H-cp149 to enhance TLR3 signaling when compared to the other capsid proteins. beAS-2B cells, R-cp was found close to the plasma membrane. at 6 h after R-cp addition, the majority of the signal was within endosomes. the RRV CP can enter cells and co-localize with TLR3. the activation of reporter production was dependent on the concentration of 1b21 added to the 293T cell culture media. the effects of the viral CPs on TLR3 signaling in HEK 293T cells were also examined using the Reovirus dsRNA as the TLR3 ligand. CP used in the assay are shown on the horizontal axes. LL37 is a potent enhancer of dsRNA-dependent TLR3 signaling. a subset of viral proteins can significantly enhance both poly(I:C) and viral dsRNA-induced TLR3 signaling. LR3 agonist in the absence of RNA-binding proteins will require in-depth analysis. we believe that this work identifies conditions that will facilitate these efforts. poly(I:C) may obviate the need for viral proteins or LL37. a deletion that increased interaction between the 2a HCV polymerase and a partially duplexed RNA template made the polymerase a better enhancer for TLR3 signaling. this is intuitive with the viral capsid proteins, but viral RdRps have surfaces that mediate oligomerization that may facilitate RNA binding. purified virions and Reovirus virions have not observed induction of cytokines or TLR3-specific reporters. we also demonstrated that two dsRNA-binding proteins can colocalize with TLR3 in endosomes. however, it is known that TLR3 binds to linear dsRNA [61]. dsRNA-binding proteins could activate TLR3 signaling from cellular RNAs. lupus erythematosis has been linked to antibodies that recognize RNP complexes [63], [64], and TLR signaling can affect the production of autoantibodies associated with lupus erythematosis [65]. the open conformation exposes a binding pocket for the cell cycle regulator retinoblastoma and mediates the ubiquitinylation and degradation of retinoblastoma to increase cell cycle progression during HCV infection. viral polymerases and RNAs are expressed inside the cell and depending on the cellular locations of the polymerase protein and viral or cellular dsRNAs they recognize, could activate cytoplasmic innate immunity receptors. RNA-binding protein alone has no effect since RNAs synthesized by the HCV polymerase in cells may not enter efficiently into acidic endosomes, the site of TLR3 signaling. addition of NS5B protein to BEAS2B or HEK293T cells has minimal effect on its own but significantly activates TLR3 signaling. dsRNA made by in vitro transcription is as potent a TLR3 agonist as the genomic dsRNA extracted from Reovirus virions. this suggests that no obvious posttranscriptional modifications are required to activate TLR3 signaling. poly(I:C) may obviate the need for viral proteins or LL37. duplexed RNA template made the polymerase a better enhancer for TLR3 signaling. this is intuitive with the viral capsid proteins, but viral RdRps have surfaces that mediate oligomerization. LL37 also exists in higher order complexes in the absence of RNA and is required at micromolar concentrations. two dsRNA-binding proteins that can enhance TLR3 signaling can colocalize with TLR3 in endosomes. dsRNA-binding proteins could disrupt the tertiary structure in dsRNAs to facilitate recognition of the dsRNA by TLR3. NP complexes and TLR signaling can affect the production of autoantibodies associated with lupus erythematosis [65]. the HCV polymerase is independent of RNA synthesis since the active site mutant is capable of enhancing TLR3 signaling. the polymerase contains a template channel that can sterically accommodate ssRNA, but not dsRNA. ubiquitinylation and degradation of retinoblastoma to increase cell cycle progression. dsRNAs and viral polymerases are expressed inside the cell. dsRNAs can activate cytoplasmic innate immunity receptors such as RIG-I or endosomal TLRs. RNA-binding protein alone has no effect since RNAs synthesized by the HCV polymerase in cells may not enter efficiently into acidic endosomes, the site of TLR3 signaling. the effect and mechanism of activation by RNA-binding protein are likely different from that observed by Naka et al. [69] or Ranjith-Kumar et al. [70]. RNA from purified Reovirus virions was extracted with Trizol. followed by ethanol precipitation and a wash with 70% ethanol. BPEV dsRNA was stored in RNase-free water. transfected cells were induced 18 to 22 h later by the addition of viral dsRNAs to the culture medium to a final concentration of 1 g/mL. the cells were harvested for analysis of luciferase 14 to 18 h after poly(I:C) addition. each sample (5 M final concentration) was prepared in a total volume of 50 L containing SYPRO orange (Molecular Probes) in 100 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, and 5 mM MgCl2) the ramp condition was from 25 to 75\u00b0C, at increments of 0.5\u00b0C/min. total RNA samples pooled from either six wells of a 96-well plate or three wells of a 48-well plate were isolated from BEAS2B cells using RNeasy kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) 0.5 g of total RNA was then reverse transcribed to cDNA with MMLV reverse transcriptase. cDNA generated from 16 ng of total RNA was amplified using SYBR Green Supermix. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 30 min. after two additional washes with PBS, they were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 at room temperature for 10 min. slides were incubated with anti-NS5b antibody (mAb; 5B-3B1 from Alexis Biochemicals) and goat anti-TLR3 (R&D systems, Minneapolis, MN) overnight at 4\u00b0C. the cells were incubated with anti R-cp rabbit polyclonal antibody and anti-TLR3 (mAb, a kind gift of L. San Mateo of Centocor Inc) diluted in PBS+0.1% BSA+0.01% TX100 overnight at 4\u00b0C. slides were then probed with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 488 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for TLR3 and bovine anti-rabbit Texas Red BPEV dsRNA was purified according to the protocol of Valverde and Gutierrez. beAS2B and HEK293T cells were from ATCC and cultured in beGM media with supplements. quantification of IL6 level in culture supernatant was collected 24 h. gCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM GTP, 0.1 mM ATP and UTP, 250 nM [-32P] CTP (MP Biomedicals), 2 pmol PE46 and 1 pmol LE19p as templates. RNA products were separated by 20%-7.5 M urea polyacrylamide gels. siRNA knockdown experiments beAS-2B cells were seeded at 1.0105 cells/well in beGM amended with supplements. 6 h later, the cells were transfected with a pool of three siRNAs specific to TLR3, nonspecific control siRNA (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), or siRNA to RIG-I. a total of 40 cycles of 30 s of denaturation at 95\u00b0C followed by 30 s of annealing at 55\u00b0C and elongation at 72\u00b0C. TLR3 mRNA levels for each treatment were subtracted from corresponding GAPDH Ct values. slides were probed with a bovine anti-goat mAb (Santa Cruz biotechnology) for 1 h at RT, washed, then incubated with a goat anti-mouse secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa fluor 488 (Santa Cruz biotechnology) for 1 h at room temperature. images were obtained on a leica TCS SP5 scanning confocal microscope with an HCX PL APO Lambda Blue 63 X the endornaviral dsRNAs labeled A\u2013C were extracted from several rice isolates collected in Lousiana. however, the genomes have not been determined. pIC, pAU, and pGU are three homopolymeric RNAs. LL37 was at the final concentrations of 3 M, 1b21 or 2a21 were at 0.5 M. poly(I:C) was at 0.13 g/ml. a demonstration that the mutant HCV polymerases retain the ability to bind the SL26 RNA.
