{"summary": "the transmission of vaccine ILTV from vaccinated- to unvaccinated chickens can cause severe respiratory disease. a microarray analysis was performed to understand host-vaccine ILTV interactions at the host gene transcription level. ILTV has a linearized dsDNA genome of approximately 150 kb in size. genome encodes 80 predicted viral protein open reading frames (ORFs) ILTV infection causes respiratory disease symptoms in chickens, pheasants, partridges, and peafowl. human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [18,19], chicken anemia virus [22], human cytomegalovirus (hCMV) [23], Epstein-Barr virus [24], infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV) [25], varicella-zoster virus [26], alphaherpes virus [27], herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) [29], even in vaccine strains including recombinant flavivirus ILTV gene expression for UL35 and US5 was determined by RT-PCR. cytopathic effects were observed at 4 dpi. no significant dye effects were detected in all microarray slides. expression of 18 of the 933 differentially expressed genes was subjected to qPCR using the same RNA samples as those used in the microarray. expression pattern for 12 genes completely matched the microarray data at four dpi time points. expression pattern for the remaining 6 genes also qualitatively matched to microarray data.

Functional groups of differentially expressed genes. the top 20 functional groups are mostly related to tissue development, cellular growth and proliferation, organismal development, cell death, cellular development, cellular development, and inflammatory responses. top 10 most differentially expressed genes in ILTV vaccine infection were selected based on differences of standard deviation (SD) among all four dpi time points. the 10 most differentially expressed genes involved in functions of reduced inflammatory responses, stimulation of cell proliferation, suppression of apoptosis, and promotion of cell-to-cell interactions. up-regulation of THBS2 in vaccine ILTV infection may play a role in cell death and recovery of cells. PPIF \u2022 Peptidylprolyl isomerase F, one of the peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) family proteins. down-regulation of NMU may represent the inhibition of cellular factors associated with inflammation. ADAM28 is a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain 28. up-regulated at carcinoma cells and functions proliferation and progression of human lung and breast cancer cells. IL6, one of several cytomegalovirus secreted cytokines, enhances the survival of endothelial cells by blocking caspase 3 and caspase 7-mediated apoptosis. adenovirus infection to mouse lung caused the down-regulation of AQP5 gene expression in vaccine ILTV infection from 2 to 4 dpi. the down-regulation of CCK expression in vaccine ILTV infected cells may suppress apoptosis, resulting in weak cytopathic effects. the top 4 networks were identical among all four dpi. MGAT3 (mannosyl glucosaminyltransferase 3), HS6ST1 (heparin sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase 1), and CIRBP (cold inducible RNA binding protein) are also upregulated in vaccine ILTV infection. enzymatic antioxidants in lung cells would reduce cellular oxidative stress. 213 differentially expressed genes that responded to vaccine ILTV infection were compared to the 273 differentially expressed genes found in the previous virulent ILTV infection study. of these 25 genes, 21 showed a similar differential expression pattern as found in the virulent ILTV infection at 1 and 3 dpi. deregulation of BMP signaling is also implicated in disease states including cancer. BMPs including BMP2 mediate herpesviral reactivation found in the EBV positive cell line. ation factor, F10, is highly expressed during the early phase of SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) corona virus infection in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) expression of F10 in vaccine ILTV infections of lung cells increased at 1- and 3dpi, but the expression in virulent ILTV was not changed significantly at either 1- or 3dpi. cytopathic effect development at 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 dpi is displayed by phase-contrast microscopic images at 200 magnification. ILTV gene expression for UL35 and US5 was determined by RT-PCR. chicken GAPDH (chGAPDH) was used as an endogenous control. qPCR results indicated that the microarray data in this experiment were valid to determine host gene expression responses against vaccine ILTV infection. the microarray data in this experiment were valid to determine host gene expression responses against vaccine ILTV infection.
