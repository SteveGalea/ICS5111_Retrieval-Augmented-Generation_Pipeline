{"summary": "the sunda slow loris (Nycticebus coucang), a nocturnal, arboreal prosimian species native to Indonesia (Sumatra), western Malaysia (Peninsular Malaysia), Singapore and southern Thailand (Nekaris and Streicher, 2008). the biggest threat endangering those animals is the pet trade\u2014they are the most commonly protected primates species sold as exotic pets in southeast Asia. it is a rare type of cancer in humans and cases have been reported in other species of animals, including chickens, dogs, cats, camels, macaques, and lemurs. a viral etiology can be postulated as the existence of viruses involved in the development of hematopoietic cancers have been recognized. parvoviruses (viral family Parvoviridae) are small non-enveloped single stranded DNA viruses which are able to infect a wide range of species of vertebrates and arthropods (subfamily Densovirinae) according to the latest ICTV classification (2013) 8 genera are recognized within the subfamily Parvovirinae and 5 of them include viruses infecting primates. parvoviruses have been reported in literature to be associated with solid and hematopoietic cancers. however, since they rely on actively replicating cells, the increased presence of these viruses might also derive from the permissive nature of the tumor cells. some of these viruses have even proven to possess oncosuppressive effects on transformed cells. organ samples included 17 livers, 6 spleens, 15 kidneys, 10 lungs, 6 hearts, 7 intestines (5 small intestines and 2 large intestines) samples belonged to 25 individuals (18 N. coucang and 7 N. pygmaeus) with various types of disease. the average size of the whole library was estimated with Agilent 2100Bioanalyzer (high sensitivity DNA kit, Agilent Technologies) samples were then diluted to a final concentration of 1 million copies/l and used as input for the emulsion PCR (LIB-A emPCR kit, Roche) after sequencing, primer sequences were trimmed from every read and assembled with codonCode Aligner software, version 3.5.6. primer annealing to the known viral sequence was used as a template for new primer design. a portion of the NS1 ORF was amplified and cloned into TOPO\u00ae cloning vector according to the instructions of the manufacturer. all positive samples were subjected to a specific amplification of a 1231 nt long portion of the VP1 gene using DreamTaq DNA polymerase. the amplicons were diluted 1:10 and directly sequenced using the Big Dye terminator chemistry (BigDye\u00ae Terminator v1.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit, Applied Biosystems) a semi specific PCR would allow the amplification of the integration site. it is shown how, after the ligation of specific adaptors to the obtained digested fragments, a semi specific PCR would allow the amplification of the integration site. 5 l of cut DNA were collected and used to perform a specific ligation of VIDISCA adaptors to the digested fragments using 4 U of T4 DNA ligase. 2 semi virus-specific nested amplifications were performed using one primer complementary to the virus (I_Buddha_R1 and I_Buddha_F1 and I_Buddha_F2 for the 3\u2032 side) a primer (Ny_Alu: CCTCCCAGAGTGCTAGGATTGCAC) binding to one of these regions was designed (according to GenBank sequence with accession number DQ822059) and used alone (as a negative control) or in combination with viral specific primers (I_Buddha_R1 or I_Buddha_F1 for the first amplification step and I_Buddha_R2 or I_Buddha_F only complete sequences were included in the analysis. alignments were manually edited when needed with BioEdit software version 7.0.5.3. phylogenetic trees were constructed with Mega software version 6.06. twenty serum samples (belonging to 16 individuals: 11 N. coucang and 5 Nycticebus pygmaeus) and 61 organs collected at necropsy were screened for the presence of the virus. organ samples included 17 livers, 6 spleens, 15 kidneys, 10 lungs, 6 hearts, 7 intestines (5 small intestines and 2 large intestines) size-selection was performed to prevent the amplification of DNA fragments smaller than 200 bp using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) the amplified library was subjected to 2 consecutive purification rounds with Agencourt AMPure XP beads to completely remove excess primers and short fragments. the average size of the whole library was estimated with Agilent 2100Bioanalyzer (high sensitivity DNA kit, Agilent Technologies) the ends of the genome were determined using genomic fragments obtained by specific digestion with 2 different restriction enzymes (MseI and CviAII) to obtain overlapping fragments. VIDISCA adaptors were subsequently ligated; semi specific PCRs were then performed with a combination of one primer annealing to the known viral sequence and one to the adaptor. real-time PCR reactions were performed with the Light Cycler 480 system (Roche) to detect possible differences between sequences obtained from various organs or different years. all positive samples were subjected to a specific amplification of a 1231 nt long portion of the VP1 gene using DreamTaq DNA polymerase. primers annealing at the end of VP1 allows the amplification of the connecting genomic sequence. the purple lines represent the host genomic sequence, the orange flashes indicate restriction enzyme sites and the orange boxed indicate artificially ligated adaptors. 7.5 l DNA eluate was cut in a 20 l reaction mix containing 5 U of NdeI restriction enzyme. prior to inactivation, 5 l of cut DNA were collected and used to perform a specific ligation of VIDISCA adaptors to the digested fragments using 4 U of T4 DNA ligase (life technologies) I_Buddha_R4 (GAAATTTGAATTTCCATCTCTTAGCTTGAGTC) and I_Buddha_R2/I_Buddha_F4 (CAAACCCTGCAATGGTGTAGATG) during the second amplification step. the third approach for integrated DNA detection made use of the Alu elements, DNA sequences which are highly repeated in primate genomes. sequences of known parvoviruses were downloaded from the GenBank database. only complete sequences were included in the analysis. a bootstrap analysis (1000 replicates) was performed. a serum sample collected at necropsy was used as input for virus discovery. the principal observations included a significantly enlarged spleen with a homogeneous cut surface and a mottled liver with irregular patches of pallor. a cystic mass in the right mammary gland and several small ulcers in the fundus of the stomach. a novel parvovirus and complete genome sequencing were used. a total of 8003 sequence reads were obtained from the serum sample of the slow loris with HS. a total of 35 reads (0.44% of the total) belonged to the novel virus. the genome of the novel parvovirus is 4844 nt and the genomic organization reflects the other members of the parvovirinae sub-family. the genome of the novel parvovirus is 4844 nt and the genomic organization reflects the other members of the parvovirinae sub-family with 2 large ORFs and terminal sequences. a small hairpin identified only on the 3\u2032end of the genome is shown just after the underlined VP1 stop codon. a phospholipase A2 domain of Sl.L-PV-1, that is conserved in the majority of parvoviruses, is located at the N-terminal part of the VP1 unique region. the 5\u2032 side ITR is oriented 5\u2032 to 3\u2032, while the 3\u2032 side ITR is oriented in the opposite direction. a 44 nt sequence was identified which is present only on the 3\u2032 side of the genome, just after the TAA stop codon of VP1/VP2. phylogenetic analyses of slow loris parvovirus 1 (Sl.L-PV-1) are located between the Dependoparvovirus and the Tetraparvovirus genera and do not significantly cluster with any other known parvovirus. the evolutionary history of Sl.L-PV-1 and the other members of the Parvovirinae subfamily was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method.

Virus evolution A 1231 nt fragment of the VP1 ORF end was sequenced from all positive samples. the polymorphisms predominantly included transitions (81.25%, 13/16) and only two were non-synonymous. no fixation can be accounted if we consider altogether the sequences from 2008. the appearance of new variable sites over time can also be noted, like at codon position 645 where a polymorphism appeared only in 2008. the presence of integrated or episomal viral genomes could be postulated. no evidence for integrated viruses could be found. there was also no evidence of a circular covalently closed genomic form which could have persisted in tissues as an episomal form. a total of 8003 sequence reads were obtained from the serum sample of the slow loris with HS. a total of 35 reads (0.44% of the total) belonged to the novel parvovirus. a novel parvovirus can be classified within the parvoviridae family only if the complete coding sequence is provided. the genome of the novel parvovirus is 4844 nt and the genomic organization reflects the other members of the Parvovirinae sub-family. the first ORF encodes for the non-structural protein NS1 (582 AA) the conserved Calcium binding domain and enzymatic core (2) motifs are indicated by boxes. the hypothetical 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 specific terminal hairpins are represented by dashed lines. a small hairpin identified only on the 3\u2032end of the genome is shown just after the underlined VP1 stop codon. alignment of the sequences shows that they are 100% identical (but oriented in the opposite direction) and start differentiating from the ATG start codon of NS1. a 44 nt sequence was identified which is present only on the 3\u2032 side of the genome, just after the TAA stop codon of VP1/VP2. both viruses are located between the Dependoparvovirus and the Tetraparvovirus genera and do not significantly cluster with any other known parvovirus. the evolutionary history of Sl.L-PV-1 and the other members of the Parvovirinae subfamily was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method.
