{"summary": "1, 2 HPIV infections cause a spectrum of illness, ranging from the common cold to croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. the most common HPIV types associated with respiratory illness are HPIV1 and HPIV3, and HPIV2 and HPIV4 are less commonly detected. swab specimens were tested for HPIV1, HPIV2, and HPIV3 RNA. for the last 2 years, specimens were tested at the national institute of health (NIH) in Thailand using only realtime RTPCR (rRTPCR) assays. primers/probes that gave the best performance in rRTPCR assays for each virus were selected for the subsequent study (Table 1). Amplification conditions and reagents were identical to those previously described. 4 all swab specimens were also tested by RTPCR for human GAPDH or RNase P housekeeping genes. swab specimens were tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus by RTPCR. the proportion positive for HPIV and CXRconfirmed pneumonia was the same in enrolled and eligible nonenrolled patients. patients were eligible for enrollment at admission to hospital if they had evidence of active infection and at least one sign or symptom of respiratory disease. patients were eligible for enrollment at admission to hospital if they had evidence of active infection and at least one sign or symptom of respiratory disease, as described previously. for the last 2 years, specimens were tested at the national institute of health (NIH) in Thailand using only realtime RTPCR (rRTPCR) assays. we did not test for HPIV4 during September 1, 2003, to August 30, 2005. fluenza virus realtime RTPCR primer and probe sequences Assay, primer/probe Final concentration (nm) Accession no.* Location* Sequence (5\u2032>3\u2032) HPIV1 forward 500 AF457102 80368063 AGT TGT CAA TGT CTT AAT TCG TAT CAA T HPIV1 reverse 500 8111\u20138134 ATA GGC CAA AGA \u201cT\u201dTG TTG TTG TCG AGA CTA TTC CAA HPIV RTPCR/rRTPCR result showed a fourfold increase in IgG antibody titer to HPIV1, HPIV2, and HPIV3. all swab specimens were also tested for influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, and adenovirus by RTPCR. rRTPCR assays were specific with hightiter cultures of HPIV1 (C35), HPIV2 (Greer) and HPIV3 (C243) and were nonreactive with a broad range of other respiratory pathogens. influenza viruses A and B, RSV, HPIV4A and HPIV4B, mumps virus, human metapneumovirus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, mixed viral infections were identified in 48 (84%) patients with HPIV detection. 85% had radiographic evidence of pneumonia (interstitial infiltrates) of 468 patients with CXRs evaluated. people aged 10\u201319 years had the lowest rates of HPIVassociated hospitalized respiratory disease (4 per 100 000 personyears) the rate of HPIVassociated hospitalized respiratory disease among males was 15 per 100 000 personyears and among females was 11 per 100 000 personyears. most infections were detected in children 1\u20134 aged years for all three serotypes. infection with HPIV3 [69/118 (58%)] was more common than that with HPIV1 [85/243 (35%)]. 1 year 41 (22) 8 (15) 69 (23) 1\u20134 years** 85 (45) 19 (35) 140 (46) 5\u20139 years 11 (58) 5 (93) 15 (49) 10\u201319 years 8 (42) 4 (74) 2 (07) 20\u201364 years 22 (12) 11 (21) 36 (12) 65 years*** 22 (12) 7 (13) 43 (14) HPIV, human parainfluenza viruse. rRTPCR assays showed comparable sensitivity with serially diluted HPIV1, HPIV2, and HPIV3 RNA. of the 22 857 (55%) patients with CXRs, 10 097 (49%) were enrolled. of 573 patients with evidence of HPIV infection, 189 (33%) had HPIV1, 54 (9%) had HPIV2, 305 (53%) had HPIV3, and 27 (5%) were untyped. among the 573 patients with evidence of HPIV infection, the most common signs and symptoms of respiratory infection were fever (69%, 51% with temperature 38 and 18% with reported fever only), cough (98%), sputum production (62%), and tachypnea (54%). 89 (332%) HPIVpositive patients required oxygen therapy, and six needed mechanical ventilation. average crude and adjusted incidence for hospitalized patients with HPIV infections, Sa Kaeo and Nakhon Phanom Provinces, Thailand, September 1, 2003, to December 31, 2007 Age group (in years) Personyears of Population under Surveillance Enrolled/eligible patients (% of eligible) Enrolled patients with CXRconfirmed pneumonia (% of enrolled) most infections were detected in children 1\u20134 aged years for all three serotypes. among children aged 1\u20134 years, infection with HPIV3 [69/118 (58%)] was more common than that with HPIV1 [85/243 (35%)]. ***1 patient aged 1 year with HPIV1 and HPIV2 detected by PCR. seasonal pattern HPIV1 and HPIV3 viruses could be detected throughout the year and often cocirculated. the incidence of HPIVassociated hospitalized pneumonia was slightly higher in males compared with females, similar to other reports. it is difficult to prove that detection of HPIV from the upper respiratory tract was associated with LRTI. 1, 18 HPIV1 circulates biennially during oddnumbered years. crossprotection of antibodies from previous HPIV infection influences predominance of circulating HPIV type. study included only hospitalized patients with CXR performed. conflict of interest No commercial or other conflict of interest declared. this study was funded by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. phares CR, Wangroongsarb P, Chantra S et al.
