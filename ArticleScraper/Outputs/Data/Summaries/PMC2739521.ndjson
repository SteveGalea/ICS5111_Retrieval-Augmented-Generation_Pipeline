{"summary": "a hitherto unknown Coronavirus (CoV) is thought to have been circulating in an animal reservoir before it crossed species barriers into humans. the large range of relevant human and animal CoV has been suggested to be resulting from host switching events [8-16]. characterization of virus proteins can be unreliable if only the protein of interest is studied on its own. in-vitro ligation of subgenomic cDNA fragments without assembly of full-length plasmids has been successfully used to establish CoV reverse genetics. a third approach is based on bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) for keeping full-length cDNA stable, owing to a low copy number of BAC DNA per E. coli cell. the first two systems use T7 RNA polymerase promoter-driven in-vitro transcription the protein is a 44 amino acid protein that is transcribed by a leaky scanning mechanism from the second ORF encoded on subgenomic RNA 7 [20,40]. it is a type III integral transmembrane protein located in the Golgi compartment [41]. it has been shown previously that the protein is a structural virion component, that it is dispensable for replication in various cell cultures, and that it induces apoptosis in cultured cells if overex a back-translated BLAST search on the nucleotide database (tBLASTn) showed that this deletion was not present in any of > 150 SARS-CoV ORF 7b sequences in GenBank. none of 8 SARS-like bat-CoV sequenced in the ORF 7b region. only one sequence derived from the Frankfurt-1 strain shows a 45 nucleotide in-frame deletion in the predicted transmembrane domain (TMD) only one sequence derived from the strain (AB257344) shows a 45 nucleotide in-frame deletion in the predicted transmembrane domain (TMD) cleavage of caspase 3 was observed in cells expressing ORF 7a and ORF 7b. expression of ORF 7b del did not cause caspase 3 cleavage. the assay was done by transfection of HEK 293 cells. cells were transfected with plasmids encoding ORF 7a, ORF 7b or ORF 7b del. expression plasmid pRL-SV40 encoding Renilla luciferase was co-transfected to normalize for interferon-independent stimulation of transcription. twenty-four hours later, cells were infected with seV to induce IFN-mediated reporter gene expression. cloned in high copy number plasmid vectors or, if refractory to cloning, in low copy plasmids. corrected subclones were assembled into four BAC clones containing about a quarter of the SARS-CoV genome each. BACs containing both versions of subclone F were assembled. squares on each plasmid symbolize the approximate positions of erroneous mutations from initial cloning corrected by fragment-extension technique before assembly to higher-order clones. small extension-PCR symbols above clones pB and pF indicate mutations introduced into plasmids to facilitate subsequent construction steps (deletion of an Mlu I-site in pB) I restriction sites at positions 4454, 8783, 12146, 19000, 24124, 31719, and 36168, resulting in 7 digestion fragments as annotated in the gel picture. supernatants were taken from BHK cells 24 h after transfection with in-vitro transcripts from the BAC cDNA clone. the recombinant virus containing the full-length ORF 7b gene was named rSCV. the virus containing the deletion in ORF 7b was termed r7bTMD. both viruses were amplified on vero cells and stored for further experiments. y-axis represents the starting RNA concentrations after virus absorption (1 h) and change of medium in each culture. a protein band corresponding to the predicted molecular weight of the 7b protein (5.3 kDa) was specifically detected in rSCV7bflag-infected cells using an anti-flag antibody. the deletion in ORF 7b enhances growth of virus in cell culture. the same experiment was read out using serum of a human SARS survivor. a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 was used for both viruses in vero and caCo-2 cells. HEK 293-lp cells were seeded in six-well plates and infected with rSCV or r7bTMD at an MOI of 5. rSCV did not induce interferon beta mRNA transcription. rSCV did not induce interferon beta mRNA transcription, confirming earlier findings. the IFN standard exemplifies the sensitivity and linear range of the assay. the panel shows the results of triplicate experiments on vero cells. for each graph the zero value indicates the log RNA concentration achieved without interferon, to which the rest of the data were normalized. r7bTMD replicated to marginally higher virus concentrations than rSCV in presence of interferon. more efficient replication was again observed for r7bTMD. deletion in ORF 7b does not alter the capability of virus to induce apoptosis. recombinant coronaviruses rSCV and r7bTMD were infected with rSCV or r7bTMD at an MOI of 5. the deletion confers a significant replicative advantage in Syrian golden hamsters Deletions occurred during the 2003 epidemic and were transmitted in the community. Golden Syrian hamsters were infected with 104 PFU of rSCV and r7bTMD (x-axis) heat inactivated rSCV served as mock control. for each point of time post infection, three animals per virus variant were sacrificed. two-tailed t-tests were done on logarithmic values. replication advantage for r7bTMD was in concordance with findings in CaCo-2 and HuH-7 cell cultures. deletion was not present in any of > 150 SARS-CoV ORF 7b sequences in GenBank. ORF 7b amino acid alignment of all SARS- and SARS-like CoV available in GenBank. only one sequence derived from the Frankfurt-1 strain shows a 45 nucleotide in-frame deletion in the predicted transmembrane domain (TMD) control cells were infected with Sendai virus (SeV) or left untreated. lysates were analyzed for procaspase 3 cleavage by Western blot. expression of ORF 7b del did not cause caspase 3 cleavage. cells were either superinfected with SeV (20 hemagglutinating units) or left uninfected. interferon-specific reporter gene expression was determined 24 h after superinfection. seven PCR fragments covering the whole genome were generated with primers described by Yount et al. [32] for construction of the variant with an intact ORF 7b, the 45 nt deletion was filled in by oligonucleotide extension PCR on subclone pF. plasmids pA1 - pF were cloned in subgenomic plasmids. squares on each plasmid symbolize positions of erroneous mutations. small extension-PCR symbols above clones indicate mutations introduced into plasmids. fragment ends shown in close proximity were first ligated in-vitro. the ligation products were then purified, ligated at sites drawn in greater distance, and transformed in E. coli. the BAC construct had seven Bgl I restriction sites. in-vitro supernatants were transferred to vero cells susceptible for SARS-CoV infection. recombinant virus containing the full-length ORF 7b gene was named rSCV. both viruses were amplified on vero cells and stored for further experiments. rSCV is the full-length virus; r7bTMD is the virus with the Frankfurt-1-specific deletion in ORF 7b. r7bTMD is the virus with the Frankfurt-1-specific deletion in the virus. the 10 kD band is non-specifically detected in all samples. vero cells were infected with the flag-tagged recombinant virus rSCV7bflag or with the recombinant virus rSCV. the deletion enhances growth of virus in cell culture. r7bTMD accumulated about 4- and 6-fold more RNA than rSCV. it was concluded that the deleted virus had a slight but reproducible growth advantage in the latter cell lines. in the absence of mechanisms of adaptive immunity, replication of RNA viruses is controlled by production of and response to type-I interferons. PCR in 293-lp cells infected with rSCV or r7bTMD at an MOI of 5. one PCR unit represents ten times the minimum concentration of interferon beta RNA detectable by the assay. one PCR unit represents ten times the minimum concentration of interferon beta RNA detectable by the assay. r7bTMD replicated to marginally higher concentrations than rSCV in presence of interferon (up to 3.4 fold increase) the deletion in ORF 7b does not alter the capability of virus to induce apoptosis in cell culture. Western blot analyzed cleavage of poly-ADP ribose polymerase type 1 (PARP-1), downstream effect of caspase-3 activation. it was concluded that the deletion-dependent ablation of the pro-apaptotic effect of ORF 7b was irrelevant in context of full virus replication in cell culture. differences in RNA concentrations decreased but remained qualitatively equivalent by day 3 (16-fold more infectious virus and RNA, respectively) differences in RNA concentrations were borderline significant on day 1. in one of three animals sacrificed on day 1 post infection, rSCV failed to replicate entirely. two-tailed t-tests were done on logarithmic values. the replication advantage for r7bTMD was in concordance with findings in CaCo-2 and HuH-7 cell cultures. it has been difficult to clone complete coV genomes due to large sizes and toxicity or lability of constructs in E. coli. Enjuanes and coworkers have presented an approach based on cloning of the entire genome in BAC and transfecting the viral cDNA under the control of a CMV promoter. the use of BAC DNA provides the remarkable benefit of being able to handle full length genomic DNA in one plasmid backbone. a bacteriophage T7-derived RNA polymerase promoter has not been used before with a plasmid-contained coV ORF 7b has been employed as a prototypic SARS-CoV in several studies on pathogenesis and antiviral therapy. this strain has been employed as a prototypic SARS-CoV in several studies on pathogenesis and antiviral therapy. the additional extent of attenuation on top of the effect of interferon beta was of the same size as that observed in untreated cell cultures. this suggests an additive rather than a synergistic effect of ORF 7b and interferon on the attenuation of virus replication. apoptosis of target cells can limit virus infection in-vitro and in-vivo. hamsters infected with the deleted variant had significantly more virus RNA and a 95-fold increase of infectious virus titers in their lungs after 24 h. the rate of successful infections was 6/6 with the deleted virus and 5/6 with the full virus. the occurrence of viruses with deletions in the ORF7/8 region in the late phase of the 2003 epidemic might have added to the efficiency of virus transmission in humans [67-69] it will be interesting in the future to investigate the exact mechanism of ORF 7b-dependent attenuation.
