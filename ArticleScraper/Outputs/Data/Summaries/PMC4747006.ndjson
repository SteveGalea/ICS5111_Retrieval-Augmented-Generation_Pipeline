{"summary": "this study was performed in an animal research facility that houses mice and rats exclusively. the animal care and use program is AAALAC-accredited. all activities involving animals were approved prior to initiation. cage bedding was hardwood chips (Sani-Chips, PJ Murphy, Montville, NJ) water provided to rats underwent reverse-osmosis purification and hyperchlorination to 3 ppm prior to animal consumption. animal care staff wore dedicated footwear and a disposable gown and gloves while performing animal care and husbandry activities. the study lasted 12 wk. Statistical analysis. differences between groups were considered significant at a P value of less than 0.05. an F test was used for variance comparison between groups. two sizes of rat cage were used in this study. those with 143 in2 (922.6 cm2) of floor space and 210 in2 (1355 cm2) of floor space. rat cage bedding was hardwood chips (Sani-Chips, PJ Murphy, Montville, NJ) each member of the breeding pairs was 12 to 18 wk old. the criteria included average time between litters, number of litters born and percentage of litters weaned per breeding pair, and average pup weight at weaning. the 8th edition of the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals recommends a defined amount (124 in2 [800 cm2] of cage floor space for a female rat with a litter. this is insufficient to accommodate an adult male rat in the same cage as an adult female and her litter. however, the cage space recommendations in the Guide do not appear to be based on specific studies. the number of rats that can be housed in a defined space needs to be considered carefully. overcrowding can result in negative effects on animals housed together. reproductive performance has been associated with animal wellbeing, particularly in production agriculture. use of larger cages could be beneficial in terms of decreasing stress levels in rats. the use of different strains of rats and the effects of various husbandry procedures and schedules on rats housed in both cage types warrant further study."}
