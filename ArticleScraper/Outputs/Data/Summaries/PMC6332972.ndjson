{"summary": "clinical data This is a case of a 42-year-old male with no significant past medical history. in febr 2015, he presented with increasing constipation that was later associated with rectal bleeding. SPECT-CT suggested diffuse bone infiltration. he received palliative radiotherapy to the pelvis in a dose of 30 grays over 10 fractions with improvement of the rectal bleeding. he developed progressive and prolonged drop in hemoglobin and platelet levels. at the due time of cycle two on 19/8/2015, his Hb was 8.2 g/dl, platelet was 85K/ml, WBC was 6.2K/ml, and neutrophils were 3.4K/ml. he showed some improvements of the mucositis and dysphagia. the third cycle was given exactly as the second one. ethmoidal mucosal thickening tripled to 1049 ng/ml. ethmoidal antigen tripled to 1049 ng/ml. the patient ran a grave course and expired on 17/10/2015. proctocolonoscopy showed a mass 4 cm from the anal canal extending proximally for 10 cm. multiple large left iliac and mesorectal lymph nodes reached a size of 2.8 cm. multiple foci of T2 hyperintensity and enhancement were detected. SPECT-CT suggested diffuse bone infiltration. MRI showing the rectal lesion with the perirectal fat stranding. SPECT-CT showed diffuse bone and bone marrow lesions. his HB was 10.5 g/dl, platelets were 109K/ml, WBC was 6.2K/ml, and neutrophils were 3.4K/ml. he showed some improvements of the mucositis and dysphagia. the third cycle was given exactly as the second one. gen tripled to 1049 ng/ml. colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer in males and the second in females. colorectal SRCCs are present at an advanced stage with T3 or T4, positive LN, and distant metastases. they express mucin-related genes (HATH1, MUC2, and SOX2) and show disruption of the E-cadherin/beta-catenin complex. SRCC is the second cause of cancer mortality both in males and females. Isolated SKM is rare, occurring in 1\u20132% of CRC [8]. it affects the vertebral column in 65%, hip/pelvis in 34%, long bones in 26%, and other bones in 17%. time from diagnosis to onset of SKM ranges from 10 to >5000 days with a median of 11 months. the most common metastatic site associated with BMM from solid tumors is the bone in 70% of cases followed by liver (14%), brain (10%), and lung (10%) metastases. BM biopsy is the surest and fastest method of diagnosis, but the clinical relevance of micrometastasis in BM is to be validated. survival of patients with thrombocytopenia is shorter than with normal platelet counts (1 month vs. 13 months) survival of patients with thrombocytopenia is shorter than with normal platelet counts (1 month vs. 13 months) survival of patients with thrombocytopenia is shorter than with normal platelet counts (1 month vs. 13 months) the concomitant mucosal thickening of the paranasal sinus raised the issue of secondary meningitis. the overall survival from the onset of LMC was 3 weeks. there are no direct financial, indirect financial, and career or personal belief conflicts."}
