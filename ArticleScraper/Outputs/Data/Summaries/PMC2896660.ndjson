{"summary": "biodefense is the process to protect both civilian and military populations. it has become clear that many highly pathogenic microorganisms can be considered as either agents of biological warfare or naturally occurring disease threats. the biodefense field represents a unique challenge for vaccine development as the traditional economic models are based on large populations purchasing a vaccine to protect against common infectious diseases. many vaccines are in preclinical development, including a number of candidate vaccines for Lassa virus [1\u20136] and Sin Nombre [7, 8] virus, both being important hemorrhagic fever viruses. candid #1 has had investigational new drug status in USA. the advent of the 21st century has seen our expertise in molecular biology increase exponentially. we are heading towards a position where vaccines can be rationally designed based on our molecular knowledge. this includes selection of an optimum immunogen and delivery system to maximize the host protective immune response. a central feature of many biothreat pathogens is the infection of macrophages and dendritic cells as the primary target for replication. a central feature of many biothreat pathogens is the infection of macrophages and dendritic cells as the primary target for replication. infection of these cell types enables viruses to prevent immune response development at an early, central stage. large DNA viruses, such as Variola virus, contain large genomes of almost 200 kb encoding several genes that modulate the host immune response. deletion of an entire multigene family with a hypothesized role in modulation of the interferon system still results in viral replication [18] a novel application of this technology is to use the differentially expressed genes as a marker of upstream transcription factor activation using bioinformatics tools such as CARRIE [24, 25]. host signaling pathways activated or repressed by virus infection can be inferred and studied further, in particular those inhibited by virus-induced proteins that are critical in the pathogenesis of the virus. studies using virulent/attenuated pairs allow one set of responses to be \u201csubtracted\u201d from the other, filtering the dataset down to a more manageable size for further analysis. a number of virus pairs have been used for these types of analyses. studies using guinea pig model for Lassa fever have taken advantage of two passage variants of the virus which cause either a severe hemorrhagic fever or a mild, self-limiting infection. infection with the attenuated virus induced significantly more cellular signaling events and immune response activation than infection with the virulent virus. similar findings have been reported using non-high-throughout assays. a number of studies have compared Lassa virus with the related naturally nonvirulent arenavirus mopeia virus. a number of studies have compared Lassa virus with the related naturally nonvirulent arenavirus mopeia virus. the clone 13 strain of RVFV has a large deletion in the NSs coding region, removing its ability to inhibit the type-I interferon response. the clone 13 strain of RVFV has a large deletion in the NSs coding region, removing its ability to inhibit the type-I interferon response, which leads to a highly attenuated phenotype in mice. the major difficulty of all these studies is undertaking studies on wild-type virulent virus in human cells due to biocontainment requirements. studies in humans are very hard to undertake as patient samples do not usually become available until late in the disease course or from deceased individuals. gene expression analysis is used to compare cellular responses following infection with mock, wild-type and attenuated or candidate vaccine strain viruses. groups of genes that may be specifically upregulated by a particular virus variant will become apparent. example network constructed from microarray analysis of viral infection. example transcriptional expression data were uploaded to the ingenuity pathway analysis application. these approaches can allow the visualization of networks associated with viral infection. the number of parameters can be tailored to strike a balance between what is experimentally feasible and predictive accuracy. as the number of parameters increases, classification accuracy may improve, but collecting the data may become less feasible experimentally. using these approaches, it may be possible to screen large numbers of protein sequences in silico to elucidate amino acid mutations. the protein sequence remains unchanged from the wild-type virus. this reduces the likelihood of reduced protection by the attenuating mutations disrupting important epitopes. the majority of high-throughput data to emerge from the biodefense field has been microarray mRNA expression data, rather than from high-throughput protein interaction data. studies of human responses to the yellow fever vaccine using mRNA microarrays have revealed the immune pathways responsible for protection. this raises one of the problems of utilizing system biology in vaccine development. however, these studies reveal significant insights at the molecular level into how a historically very successful vaccine induces protection. a possible solution could be the use of novel adjuvants to stimulate the signaling pathways associated with a strong immunogenic response. a novel nanoparticle-based vaccine delivery method has recently been reported which includes lipopolysaccharide to activate the inflammasome alongside delivery of a protein subunit vaccine. one such database has collected over 300 protein sequences from pathogenic arenaviruses to aid in epitope discovery studies. this type of approach, combined with computational MHC epitope prediction, will significantly further our ability to rationally develop immunogenic vaccine candidates. cellular responses to attenuated virus vaccines can guide us in the development of novel vaccine candidates. the introduction and spread of west Nile virus to north America illustrates how quickly viruses can become established in a new area and present novel threats to public health."}
