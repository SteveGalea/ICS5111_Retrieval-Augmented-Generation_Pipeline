{"summary": "human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) was first identified on march 31, 2013 in china. out of the total number of 134 cases confirmed from March to September 2013 in china, Zhejiang Province saw the greatest number (46 cases) 134 cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) were identified in 12 provinces. from march to September 2013, 134 cases were identified in 12 provinces. the number of confirmed cases in Hangzhou, the capital city of Zhejiang Province, was the largest. the CDC used 2 accounts, named China Health Education and Zhejiang Health Education, to disseminate information about behaviors to prevent respiratory communicable diseases. inaccurate information and negative attitudes toward emerging communicable diseases may lead to unnecessary concerns, rumors, social chaos, and even excessive panic. CDC conducted cross-sectional and closed survey among mobile phone users in Zhejiang province. a total of 500,000 users from the 5 examined regions in the database of China Unicom were selected. participants' personal information was kept confidential and stored at China Unicom. survey questionnaire was designed by the Zhejiang CDC. participants answered questions about their attitudes toward H7N9. the questionnaire was executed through a mobile internet application platform. answers of 'yes' and 'unclear' were coded into the high-KAP category. answers of 'highly influenced' and'moderately influenced' were coded into the other category. for questions about how one\u2019s daily life had been influenced by H7N9. participants' personal information was kept confidential and stored at China Unicom. 500,000 users from the 5 examined regions in the database of China Unicom were selected. participants who did not complete the questionnaire were excluded. participants answered sociodemographic questions about age, gender, occupation, and education. the questionnaire was executed through a mobile Internet application platform of China Unicom from April 25 to May 2, 2013. answers of visiting a hospital with occurrence of symptoms were coded into the high-KAP category. answers of self-treatment and no treatment were coded into the low-KAP category. a probability (P) value of less than.05 was considered statistically significant. 8379 of 9105 participants (92.03%) had some knowledge of the symptoms of H7N9 and 6816 (74.86%) had some knowledge of its transmission routes. knowledge of H7N9 differed by region, with Hangzhou having the largest. share of participants who had some knowledge about symptoms and transmission routes of H7N9 (2 8=53.0, P.001) and transmission routes of H7N9 (2 8=53.9, P.001) are shown in Figures 1 and 2.
