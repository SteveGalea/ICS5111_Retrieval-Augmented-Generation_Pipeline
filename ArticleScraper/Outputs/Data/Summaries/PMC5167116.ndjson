{"summary": "a mind-boggling 400 m2 of the intestinal epithelial surface is colonized by 100 trillion organisms. this outnumbers the cells in the human body by 10\u2013100 fold. the diversity and density of this microbial colony within the gut can be altered by antibiotics, disease co-morbidity, diet, and other environmental factors. symbiotic commensals play an essential role in the establishment of tolerogenic and immunocompetent CD4 T-cell responses, homeostatic proliferation, and repertoire determination. innate immunity is also strongly affected during a sepsis with the quantitative and qualitative alterations observed in NK cells and neutrophils. germ theory of disease Bacteria populated the earth 2 billion years before the first signs of eukaryotic life, and they inhabit virtually every terrestrial and aquatic niche on the planet. despite their long-standing claim to this world, we were unaware of their existence until very recently (150 years), when bacteriology was placed at the center of our understanding of infection and illness. a century later, we have come to understand that the host and its prokaryotic colonists exist in a carefully negotiated armistice. despite the evolutionary co-existence between the microbiome and host, the high load of bacterially derived antigen (Ag) found in the gut lumen is a challenge to mucosal lymphocytes. 80% of all intestinal bacterial species fall under the most heavily studied: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. many of these occupants are facultative anaerobes. membership in the human microbiome is evolutionarily determined. Firmicutes and Proteobacteria are enriched in the gut microbiome of children from burkina faso who follow a low-fat, high-fiber diet. the gut bacterial composition is skewed toward more Firmicutes and Proteobacteria in Italian children who have a high-fat, low-fiber diet. illustrative schematic of some of the T-cell-associated processes occurring under the subepithelial dome can be seen in Figure 1. We have chosen to focus on the T-helper 17 (Th17) subset of differentiated CD4 T cells. the enteric immune system provides CD4 T cells with both potential for survival and polarization into different effector subtypes. close interaction with luminal bacteria causes increased signaling through pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) in the epithelial barrier, specifically toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) downstream effects of this recognition include polarized transport of Ag for presentation and the secretion of proliferative (e.g. IL-7 and IL-22) or inhibitory cytokines to directly influence activation or inhibition of specific innate immune cells. ILCs are an interesting group of innate lymphoid cells that exhibit lymphoid morphology but do not express Ag-specific receptors. they are classified as ILC1 (Tbet expression and a Th1 cytokine profile), ILC2 (GATA3 expression and Th2 cytokine profile), and ILC3 (RORt expression and Th17 cytokine profile) LP DCs may be conditioned by commensals indirectly, e.g. by cytokines produced by other cells in response to the bacteria. LP DCs may be conditioned by commensals indirectly, e.g. by cytokines produced by others in response to the bacteria. Activated gut B cells will differentiate and produce IgA in a T cell-independent manner. the advantage of IgA produced in the PPs and MLNs is to act locally and limit inflammation systemically. GF mice have smaller PPs, fewer IgA-producing B cells and skewed numbers of innate lymphocyte subsets in the gut. most of these immunologic changes are rapidly reversible by the introduction of normal microbiota. iNKT cells in the lamina propria are significantly higher than in specific pathogen-free (SPF) mice. the microbiome and T-cell immunity CD4 T cells are among the most important peripheral lymphocyte subsets when it comes to the orchestration of successful immune responses. the microbiome and T-cell immunity CD4 T cells are among the most important peripheral lymphocyte subsets when it comes to the orchestration of successful immune responses. biome indirectly controls the diversity and responsiveness of the peripheral T-cell repertoire. in GF mice, T-cell responses are aberrant, and their total numbers are systemically lower than in SPF mice. there are epidemiological correlations between these changes and the incidence of autoimmunity and allergy. ization of T cells by SFB is dependent on bacterial secretion of serum amyloid A (SAA) and the delivery of this protein to T cells via enterocyte transcytosis. another member of the Firmicutes family, prevotella copri, has also been implicated in autoimmune arthritic responses. commensal lactobacilli with tryptophanase activity are a source of indoles that function as AhR ligands and promote regulatory T cell development. changes in RA and RA-like metabolites produced by commensals likely influence the environmental cues T cells receive while Ag is being presented. microbiome studies have cemented the idea that a trifecta of epithelial barrier integrity, microbial flora, and adequate innate immune responses is uniquely important to the development of healthy effector T-cell responses. a trifecta of epithelial barrier integrity, microbial flora, and adequate innate immune responses is uniquely important. al nutrition causes thinning of the protective mucus layer and decreasing barrier integrity. most of these patients are also given opioids, which reduce gut motility and (as a result) promote bacterial overgrowth. phosphate (Pi) is crucial for bacterial quorum sensing. autopsy studies and mouse models of sepsis have demonstrated the phenomenon of lymphocyte apoptosis15,16,104\u2013110 is only rivaled by epithelial cell death in the gut lumen of septic hosts. a mixture of regulatory and inflammatory T cells are consistently found systemically in septic patients. more IL-12 and more IL-10 produced by post-septic DCs after stimulation with TLR agonists compared with DCs from sham-treated mice. autopsy studies and mouse models of sepsis have demonstrated the phenomenon of lymphocyte apoptosis is only rivaled by epithelial cell death in the gut lumen of septic hosts. studies evaluating the impact of sepsis on DCs have noted the numerical reduction of these cells in both clinical and experimental settings. also less IL-12 and more IL-10 produced by post-septic DCs after stimulation with TLR agonists compared with sham-treated mice. the number of SFB-specific CD4 T cells decreased in SFB mice two days post-CLP. there was a significant increase in number of SFB-specific CD4 T cells in SFB + mice two days after CLP that remained elevated on day 30. the availability of mice containing a specific gut-resident microbe allowed a first investigation into the direct effect of gut microbiome leakage during sepsis on CD4 T cells. recent studies have estimated the theoretical diversity of the T-cell repertoire to consist of 1015\u20131020 unique TCR,130\u2013132. however, the actual number of mature T cells that have successfully navigate the thymic selection process is significantly less diverse (by an order of several magnitudes) than the number of MHC-expressed peptides. the NP311-specific CD4 T-cell population was the only one (of those we examined) to significantly increase in number in CLP- versus sham-treated mice. Upon subsequent investigation, our unpublished data suggest that the NP311-specific CD4 T cells are indeed responding to some gut-resident microbe released during CLP-induced sepsis. despite the numerical recovery of peripheral CD4 T cells, the diversity and size of Ag-specific CD4 T cell populations change after sepsis. the bottom square \u201czooms in\u201d in some of the changes occurring to specific CD4 T-cell populations during sepsis that make it possible for antigenic diversity to change. insights into the interaction between microbiome and mucosal immunity will lead to advances in poorly understood syndromes. this represents a hopeful outlook for advances in the treatment of sepsis. enteric immunity appears poised to take on that role in the 21st century."}
