{"summary": "bats of the genus Eptesicus can transmit lyssaviruses (5). reports about epidemics inside bat populations are very limited. some pathogens, such as rabies virus, are better controlled within bats. IFNs appear to play a crucial role in host-virus interactions in bats (19\u201321) studies of their antiviral defenses and regulation mechanisms are rapidly mounting. most of these studies focus on the IFN- and IFN- subtypes. spleens from two dead E. serotinus bats from the city of Berlin, Germany, that did not show any evidence of accelerated autolysis were removed and stored in RNAlater until further analysis. RNA extraction of the spleen was performed using an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Germany) the concentration and purity of RNA and genomic DNA were determined by using NanoDrop (Thermo, USA) and then stored at 80\u00b0C for further use. no appropriate genomic sequences for E. serotinus were available. Plasmids were extracted from positive clones and sequenced by using an Applied Biosystems 3130 genetic analyzer (Life Technologies, USA) they were extracted from positive clones and sequenced by using an Applied Biosystems 3130 genetic analyzer.

IFN- from P. vampyrus (GenBank accession no. HM636500) and IFN- from Equus caballus (GenBank accession no. NM_001114536) were used as query sequences to search for the IFN- and IFN- genes from a small brown bat, M. lucifugus. the exons from the matching scaffolds were then subjected to the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) BLAST programs blastN and IFN-F TGACCAATATGAGCAAATCA IFN-R AAACTCTGTGGAA IFN-F GACCACGTCCAGCTCAGC IFN-R GCGCAGTCACTGTATTTCTT gwesIFN-F1 CAAGGGGGCCTTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCTCT a genome walking method was applied in order to obtain the complete gene sequences of esIFN- and esIFN-. a genome walking method was applied according to the Genome Walker universal kit manual (Clontech, USA). for 5\u2032-end walking PCR, gwesIFN-R1 and AP1 or gwesIFN-R1 and AP1 were used in the first-round PCR. for longer promoter sequences, other sets of gene-specific primers, gwesIFN-R3/gwesIFN-R4 and gwesIFN-R4 were used in an additional round of PCR. potential transcription factor binding sites were identified by using the promoter predictor program. phylogenetic trees were constructed by MEGA5.05 using neighbor-joining method with bootstrap value of n = 1,000. PCR products amplified with primer pair PmalesIFN-F/PmalesIFN-R or PmalesIFN-F/PmalesIFN-R were inserted into pMAL-c2X plasmids which contain the maltose-binding protein (MBP) tag. a Kozak sequence was incorporated in forward primers to favor the initiation of translation. pMAL protein fusion and purification system (NEB, united Kingdom) was used to obtain esIFN- and esIFN-tagged esIFN- or esIFN-. a naturally immortalized cell line from E. serotinus brain tissue (FLG-R) was used to investigate esIFN- and esIFN- activity. coli system without glycosylation may lose its activity. cells were seeded as described above and then transfected with 1.2 g of pcDNAesIFN or pcDNAesIFN plasmid using 2 l of Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer's instructions. qRT-PCR was introduced to measure the mRNA expression levels of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-induced genes in response to stimulation. qRT-PCR was performed using EBLV-1-, EBLV-2-, and RABV-specific primers to target lyssavirus nucleoprotein genes. a melting-curve analysis was performed at the end of the reaction. the relative expression levels of targets were calculated by the 2CT method (32). Statistical analysis. all data are presented as means the standard deviations. promoter predictor reveals 2,038 bp for esIFN- and 1,071 bp for esIFN- promoter sequences. esIFN- (50-NMSK-53) and esIFN- (95-NSSV-98) were found in both promoter regions by MatInspector. esIFN- and esIFN- initiate IFN signaling in the E. serotinus brain cell line. expression levels of ISG56 mRNA were assessed by qRT-PCR. in esIFN-treated cells, ISG56 expression appeared to be dose dependent. eukaryotic expressed esIFN- and esIFN-induced a much stronger ISG56 mRNA level. expressions of Mx1 and IFIT3 were also upregulated by esIFN-. qRT-PCR results showed that both recombinant esIFN- and recombinant esIFN- can induce the expression of ISG56. esIFN- and esIFN- inhibit lyssavirus replication in an E. serotinus brain cell line. esIFN- showed a dose-dependent suppression (58 to 91% reduction) control tag MBP did not inhibit EBLV-1 replication. esIFN- and esIFN-containing supernatants were used for antiviral assays against EBLV-2 and RABV. in the EBLV-1-infected group, supernatants from poly(IC)- and pcDNAesIFN-transfected cells showed moderately inhibitory effects (54 to 69% reduction) on EBLV-1 replication (P 0.05), whereas the empty plasmid pcDNA3 supern both recombinant esIFN- and esIFN- showed antiviral properties in the E. serotinus brain cell line. the inhibitory effect of esIFN- against different lyssaviruses varies. expression patterns of IFNs and IFN-induced genes during lyssavirus infection were measured by qRT-PCR. esIFN-- and esIFN--mediated antiviral responses were still induced efficiently after viral infection. expression levels of IFN-induced genes were quantified to further evaluate whether the esIFN-- and esIFN-induced antiviral responses were still induced efficiently. bp 1422681 to 1423811) genes of M. lucifugus in Ensembl were used as reference sequences to design primers to amplify 376 bp of esIFN- and 404 bp of esIFN- specific fragments from E. serotinus. phylogenetic trees of IFN- and IFN- were constructed based on alignments of protein sequences from E. serotinus with sequences from 12 mammal species. the predicted transcription start site is shaded gray and bold. esIFN- and esIFN- initiate IFN signaling in an E. serotinus brain cell line. only the higher concentration (10 g/ml) of recombinant esIFN-induced a significant increase in ISG56 mRNA (*, P 0.05), as measured by qRT-PCR. the upregulation of ISG56 in pcDNAesIFN-transfected cells induced a 9-fold enhancement compared to empty plasmid (P 0.05) esIFN- and esIFN- inhibit the replication of lyssaviruses in a bat cell line. the control tag MBP did not inhibit EBLV-1 replication in an E. serotinus brain cell line. MBP-tagged proteins (1 and 10 g/ml) or MBP alone (1 and 10 g/ml) and then infected with EBLV-1 (MOI of 0.1) for 24 h. only the E. coli-derived esIFN- and esIFN--tagged proteins inhibited the EBLV-1 replication in a dose-dependent manner. the esIFN- supernatant led to a dose-dependent reduction of virus RNA from 92 to 98% (P 0.01) in the EBLV-2-infected group, poly(IC)-transfected supernatants showed a slight inhibitory potency to EBLV-2 infection. negative control and poly(IC)-transfected supernatants had no effect on RABV infection. IFN- expression did not change during infection, whereas IFN- was actually downregulated 50% by all three viruses. esIFN-, esIFN-, and IFN-induced genes remained silent or at a nearly silent level. esIFN-- and esIFN--pretreated cells were pretreated with eukaryotic expressed IFN in supernatants from esIFN--transfected E. serotinus brain cell line. the cells were then infected with EBLV-1 (A), EBLV-2 (B) and RABV (C) (MOI of 0.1) for 24 h. sequence characteristics of intronless genomic organization, conserved N-glycosylation sites of esIFN- and esIFN- demonstrated the structural similarities of these two types I IFNs from serotine bat to those of other mammals (35). phy. logenetic analysis in which IFN- sequences from microchiroptera and megachiroptera grouped separately from other microbat-associated sequences. a similar genetic separation was also observed following comparison of the cytochrome b sequences used for species identification. recombinant type III IFN and type II IFN from P. alecto can inhibit Pulau virus replication and Semliki Forest virus replication respectively. however, no study has yet shown whether bat IFNs are pathogen associated. analysis of promoter regions of esIFN- and esIFN- provided evidence for the control architecture of IFN- and IFN- transcription. functional studies indicated their different capacities in antiviral activity."}
