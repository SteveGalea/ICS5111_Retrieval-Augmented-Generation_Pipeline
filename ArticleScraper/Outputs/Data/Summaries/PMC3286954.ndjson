{"summary": "a genomewide expression analysis was performed in bmDCs using pI:C-stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived DCs. at least nine transcripts, typically expressed in different cells exposed to tunicamycin (11, 21, 22), were also induced in DCs responding to pI:C. pI:C was added as soluble or lipofected (pI:C-lip) protein levels of CHOP (D) and GADD34 (F) were detected by immunoblot in total cell lysates. pI:C was added as soluble or lipofected (pI:C-lip) GADD34 acts together with PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF2 and relieves translation repression during ER stress (22, 24, 25) in response to soluble pI:C, GADD34 mRNA transcription was enhanced at least 14-fold (Fig. 1E) in response to soluble pI:C, mRNA transcription was enhanced at least 14-fold (Fig. 1G) spleen CD11c+ DCs showed even higher P-eIF2 levels than nonstimulated bmDCs. this observation was further confirmed by immunohistochemistry of spleen sections. eIF2 dephosphorylation is controlled by GADD34 during pI:C-induced DC maturation. P-eIF2 levels of WT and GADD34C/C DCs stimulated with lipofected (lipo) or soluble pI:C (sol) nonstimulated cells were treated with lipofectamine only. PKR is shown as control of DC activation. eIF2 phosphorylation was nearly abolished in activated PKR/ DCs. PKR activity is therefore efficiently counteracted by GADD34 induction. procaspase 3 cleavage was reduced in response to pI:C. protein extracts were blotted for PKR, P-eIF2 (A and B) and GADD34 (C) Sodium arsenite (as) was used as a positive control for P-eIF2 induction. treatment with MG132 (2 h) was used to facilitate GADD34 visualization. cytosolic helicase MDA5 is dispensable for GADD34-inducible expression by dsRNA even upon lipofection delivery. expression was found normal in activated MDA5/ cells. synthesis was attenuated upon TRIF inactivation, although not abolished. DCs are protected from translation inhibition induced by cytosolic pI:C detection. bmDCs from WT and GADD34C/C mice were challenged with thapsigargin for the indicated time. dependent translational arrest and rely on induction of GADD34 to shift the biochemical equilibrium toward eIF2 dephosphorylation. GADD34 was absolutely required for eIF2 dephosphorylation and translation recovery upon thapsigargin treatment. phenotype of activated GADD34C/C DCs was found normal. ELISA analyzed DCs in which pI:C was delivered in the cytoplasm by lipofection. IFN- and IL-6 mRNA expression levels were measured by qPCR. one of four independent experiments with similar results is shown for each panel. at 72 h postinoculation, GADD34C/C pups displayed significantly less IFN- in the serum and in the joints than their WT littermates. at least nine transcripts, typically expressed in different cells exposed to tunicamycin, were also induced in DCs responding to pI:C. mRNA levels of ATF4 (A), CHOP (C), GADD34 (E), PP1 (G) and CReP (H) were detected by immunoblot in nuclear extracts. pI:C was added as soluble or lipofected (pI:C-lip) pI:C-activated DCs display an ATF4 transcriptional signature during which, CHOP expression seems to be specifically down-modulated at the translational level. pI:C-activated DCs display an ATF4 transcriptional signature during which, CHOP expression seems to be specifically down-modulated at the translational level. eIF2 dephosphorylation is controlled by GADD34 during pI:C. the levels of phosphorylated eIF2 (P-eIF2) were gradually lost during pI:C stimulation. protein synthesis was quantified in protein extracts of pI:C-activated DCs. cell extracts were blotted for P-eIF2 and total eIF2. both drugs were added at the same time as pI:C. the same result was found when using DCs inactivated for GADD34 (GADD34C/C) (25) PKR acts as a signal transducer in the proinflammatory response to different PAMPs. PKR activation results in eIF2 phosphorylation and protein synthesis arrest (7, 32) PKR phosphorylates eIF2 in pI:C-activated DCs. protein extracts were blotted for PKR, P-eIF2 (A and B) and GADD34 (C) PKR and its NOX2-dependent activation have been implicated in amplifying part of the UPR. recently, PKR and its NOX2-dependent activation have been implicated in amplifying part of the UPR and linking it to inflammation. pI:C lipofection of MEFs efficiently caused a PKR-dependent translation arrest within 8 h. translation arrest observed in WT MEFs suggests soluble dsRNA can efficiently access the cytosol of these cells and interact with PKR. bmDCs from chx, and lipofectamine-treated (mock) cells were lipofected with pI:C. protein translation, P-eIF2, and total eIF2 were detected by immunoblotting. GADD34 is not important to establish or maintain DC resistance to dsRNA-induced translation arrest. a reduction in surface MHC II and CD86 levels was detected in the cell culture supernatants of GADD34C/C DCs. we measured the mRNA expression of IFN- and IL-6 transcripts. in the absence of functional GADD34, the levels of these transcripts were reduced by half after 8 h of pI:C stimulation. each data point represents the arithmetic mean SD for at least four mice. we injected i.v. the Friend leukemia virus B sensitive mouse strain. we then analyzed IFN- blood levels at 3 and 6 h postinjection. GADD34 induction has been singled out in a transcriptome analysis of listeria monocytogenes-infected macrophages (41) and during corona virus infection of fibroblasts (42), suggesting its association with pathogen detection. the penetration of dsRNA in all cellular compartments can be detected through TLR3, DExD/H-box helicases, and PKR (43) thapsigargin-induced protein synthesis arrest but GADD34 inactivation does not impact significantly on protein synthesis in response to dsRNA delivery. eIF2 phosphorylation levels do not fully correlate with protein synthesis intensity and confirms specific translation regulation pathways operate in during microbe detection. dsRNA is probably an extreme example of microbial-associated stressor. it can also induce PKR through direct recognition in the cytosol. dsRNA is probably an extreme example of microbial-associated stressor. IL-6 mRNA was less induced in activated GADD34C/C cells. a search for additional targets will allow better understanding of regulation pathways controlled by this specific pathogen-induced stress response."}
