{"summary": "a few years ago I suggested that the neglect of clinical research in family practice was due to three things: devaluation of taxonomic research, lack of awareness of limitations of randomized controlled trials, and lack of confidence in our ability to add to medical knowledge. in present-day practice there is a pervasive sense that we are at the \u201cend of history\u201d that there are no new diseases to be discovered. a neo-McWhinnean revolution might require a neo-McWhinnean revolution to foster and promote family physicians\u2019 attention to close observation in clinical care. the first step is to re-evaluate the way we train family medicine residents to engage with research. some would argue that by the end of such an exercise we have permanently inoculated our residents against the importance of research in their clinical practices. the second step is to systematically develop processes that would allow clinicians working at the \u201ccoal face\u201d to engage with the developing cadre of professional family medicine researchers. a third and final step is to remove the structural barriers to publishing and disseminating original clinical discoveries. family medicine journals must take risks and provide places for family physicians to publish and share individual clinical observations. one of us (R.E.G.U.) has developed the IMPACT clinical program in collaboration with family medicine colleagues. a pilot project was designed and funded to help teaching. on the brink of the 60th anniversary of the College and of family medicine in Canada it is time to ask the following: Is family medicine research at risk of losing something at its very heart."}
