{"summary": "a 62-year-old woman was hospitalized for acute respiratory distress syndrome. she had regular physical activity and no history of respiratory disease or smoking. fourteen days later, she was discharged from intensive care unit and received respiratory physical therapy. three months later, she continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance. the cause of ARDS can be respiratory (infectious or inhalation pneumonitis) or extra respiratory (acute pancreatitis) long-term sequelae are frequently observed in survivors, with physical and/or psychological impairments and altered higher functions. the chest X-ray on admission showed bilateral alveolar-interstitial syndrome with bilateral lower lobe consolidations. she was admitted to the pulmonary critical care unit on 5 April 2016 with signs of acute respiratory distress. the patient was intubated and transferred to the intensive care unit. after respiratory distress secondary to laryngeal edema, the patient was reintubated, and systemic corticosteroid therapy (1 mg.kg1) was initiated. the definitive extubation (D+13) proceeded without complication. the patient was discharged from the intensive care unit (D+14) after weaning from oxygen. the patient (body mass: 63.0 kg, i.e., BMI: 25.6 kg.m2) was seen in consultation in the pulmonary department. she continued daily physical activity with satisfactory tolerance (30 minutes/day of treadmill walking and 15 minutes/day cycling at moderate intensity) ARDS is an acute edema of the lungs with a high mortality rate. the progression of histological lesions has been described as resulting in diffuse alveolar damage. a large amount of collagen is secreted by type II pneumocytes. the respiratory sequelae in ARDS are related to alveolar-capillary membrane impairment with diminished exercise capacity. these sequelae diminish over time but do not disappear, even over the long term. the physical and psychological sequelae persisted at 5 years. 6-minute walk test is feasible, valid, reproducible, and sensitive in patients with respiratory diseases [19, 20]. this field exercise test may be recommended to evaluate tolerance exercise in ARDS survivors. the respiratory sequelae of ARDS had a significant clinical impact on our patient, especially during exercise.
