{"summary": "international tourist arrivals reached 1.3 billion in 2017 and are expected to exceed 1.6 billion by 2020. vaccinations are a key component of the pre-travel health consultation. vaccines with multi-dose schedules such as rabies and Japanese encephalitis are low for a variety of reasons. this is the first study to analyse a large group of LMTs. a better understanding of LMTs may help travel medicine providers to develop improved strategies to decrease the number of LMTs. a better understanding of LMTs may help travel medicine providers develop improved strategies to decrease the number of LMTs. clinicians confirmed all traveller-provided information and entered data on immunization history, immunizations administered, medications prescribed and advice given. if a vaccine was not administered, the clinician gave a reason why [vaccine not indicated, pre-existing immunity or if the clinician determined the traveller was immune based on past illness], medical contraindication, insufficient time. more LMTs travelled for business (26% vs 16%; P 0.0001) or to VFRs (15% vs 8%; P 0.0001) compared to their non-LMT counterparts. more LMTs travelled for 29 or more days (27% vs 21%; P 0.0001) and travelled exclusively to urban destinations (40% vs 29%; P 0.0001) travel agent 3497 (6) 396 (3) 0.0001 Referred by employer 5838 (10) 1738 (15) 0.0001 Referred by employer 5838 (10) 1738 (15) 0.0001 Family recommended 10 178 (17) 1792 (15) 0.01 Public health announcement 542 (1) 119 (1) 0.09 Concerned about health issues. difference in the distribution of age between the groups was obtained from the non-parametric Wilcoxon rank sum test. a total of 51% of LMTs and 58% of non-LMTs visited YF-endemic countries received the YF vaccine. the most common reason for not receiving the YF vaccine was pre-existing immunity. less than 1% of both LMTs and non-LMTs travelling to YF countries did not receive the YF vaccine because of insufficient time. the most visited countries for both LMTs and non-LMTs were India, Thailand, South Africa, China and Kenya. the accelerated rabies schedule is not FDA approved in the USA. one-half of all LMTs travelling to YF-endemic countries received the YF vaccine. 1% of both LMTs and non-LMTs had the YF vaccine deferred due to insufficient time. late vaccination against YF would also mean that serious adverse vaccine reactions such as YF vaccine-associated neurotropic and viscerotropic disease may not present until after the traveller arrived. this finding appears to be partly due to the higher proportion of VFRs among LMTs, since VFRs have been shown to travel longer than other types of travellers. a cost\u2013benefit analysis of JE vaccination for business travellers concluded that the benefits of vaccination outweigh the costs when multiple trips to endemic areas are planned. travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFRs) could also benefit from strategies to improve the timing of their pre-travel consultations. large sample size leads to small P values making small differences significant. other limitations include the fact that GTEN sites are specialized travel clinics so GTEN travellers may not be representative of all travellers. some travellers might have been seen at the last minute because of access issues rather than traveller-dependent factors. our findings suggest business and VFR travellers should be targeted by strategies to improve timely pre-travel health consultation. newly approved accelerated vaccination schedules may also be considered."}
