{"summary": "ORF3 is a transmembrane protein localized at ER membranes and forms multimeric complexes. this prediction was corroborated following expression of HEV ORF3 in HepG2C3A cells. in these cells, we observed colocalization of ORF3 with the ER-associated protein calnexin. HepG2C3A cells lentivirally transduced with HEV ORF3-HA were stained with anti-HA and anti-calnexin antibodies. nuclei were stained with Hoechst dye. colocalization was analyzed by ImageJ, and Pearson's r = 0.44 0.063. ORF3 has a short tail at the N terminus that resides in the ER lumen and a long cytosolic tail at the C terminus that is prone to phosphorylation at a serine in position 70 (24, 25). supernatants collected from these cultures at day 5 posttransfection were then used to infect nave HepG2C3A cells. rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] was complemented in trans with HEV ORF2 and IAV M2. this signal was approximately twofold lower than the 8- to 15-fold increase in Gluc activity. this signal was approximately twofold lower than the 8- to 15-fold increase in Gluc activity. cell culture supernatants from nave HepG2C3A, or HepG2C3A cells transduced with HEV ORF2 or/and ORF3 were collected 5 d posttransfection with rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] RNA. after 12 h, cells were washed and Gaussia luciferase activity quantified in the cell culture supernatants. 3, or M2(A30P) cells were incubated with rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] RNA. after 12 h, cells were washed and intracellular total RNA was extracted 4 d later. injected oocytes were immunolabeled with polyclonal ORF3 or M2 antibodies and analyzed by confocal microscopy. injected oocytes were immunolabeled with polyclonal ORF3 or M2 antibodies. X. laevis oocytes expressing HEV ORF3, IAV M2, IAV M2(A30P) or control oocytes were bathed in Ringer solution. the standard voltage-clamp protocol consisted of rectangular voltage step pulses from 90 to +60 mV in 10-mV increments applied from a holding voltage of 60 mV. a one-way ANOVA confirmed difference between the different groups. no difference was found for HEV ORF3 at pH 5 and M2 at pH 10. whole-cell instantaneous currents were examined under different ionic conditions to estimate the selectivity properties of the HEV ORF3 channel. little difference in the reversal potential suggested that HEV ORF3 formed nonselective ion channels. current traces from X. laevis oocyte expressing HEV ORF3 wild type using the protocol in A. the bathing solution contained 117 mM NaCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2 and 10 mM Hepes. we aimed to systematically identify regions within HEV ORF3. Western blots of lysates from HepG2C3A cells expressing HA-tagged ORF3 showed that all mutants except ORF3[RLA29-31AAA] and ORF3[VV32-34AAA could readily be detected with an anti-HA antibody. those that did express well, with exception of ORF3[CCC11-13AAA], still formed higher molecular weight complexes indicative of multimerized ORF3. lentivirally delivered to HepG2C3A cells expressing ORF2. dually transduced cells were then transfected with rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] RNA. asterisk marks serine residue of ORF3, which can be phosphorylated. 3A cells lentivirally transduced with HA-tagged wild type or the indicated ORF3 mutant were stained with anti-HA and anti-calnexin antibodies. shown are representative images of triplicate experiments. human hepatoma cell line permissive to HEV infection. we observed colocalization of ORF3 with the ER-associated protein calnexin. lysates derived from hepG2C3A cells coexpressing FLAG- and HA-tagged ORF3 did not pull down ORF3. lysates from cells lentivirally transduced to express ORF3-HA or mock transduced were analyzed by Western blotting with an anti-HA antibody. the monomer and oligomers are indicated with arrowhead and arrows, respectively. supernatants were used to infect nave HepG2C3A cells. supernatants were then used to infect nave HepG2C3A cells. the recombinant HEV subgenome replicated equally efficiently in all cells. the signal was approximately twofold lower than the 8- to 15-fold increase in Gluc activity, resulting from infection with particles packaged in cells expressing HEV ORF2 and ORF3. this signal was approximately twofold lower than the 8- to 15-fold increase in Gluc activity. 2C3A, or HepG2C3A cells transduced with HEV ORF2 or/and ORF3, were collected 5 d posttransfection with rHEVORF2/3[Gluc] RNA. after 12 h, cells were washed and intracellular total RNA was extracted 4 d later. HEV RNA was normalized to the housekeeping gene GAPDH. data represent the mean SD (n = 3), *P 0.05, **P 0.01, and ***P 0.001. Nave HepG2C3A cells were incubated with these supernatants. after 12 h, cells were washed and Gaussia luciferase activity quantified in the cell culture supernatants 4 d later. data represent the mean SD (n = 6\u20139). oocytes were clamped at 80 mV, followed by a 1-s depolarization to +20 mV. voltage was then stepped to test voltages ranging from 80 to +50 mV. oocytes expressing wild-type ORF3, wild-type M2 or mutant mutant mRNAs were studied by holding the membrane voltage of the oocytes at 60 mV and then applying voltage step pulses every 10 mV from 90 to +60 mV. no difference was found for HEV ORF3 at different pHs. selective ion channels do not show significant changes in the reversal potential as expected for nonselective channels. current traces showing baseline current in mock (A) and IAV M2(A30P)-injected oocytes (B) are shown. alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to change triplets of amino acids to alanine across the entire ORF3 protein. supernatants were used to infect nave HepG2C3A cells. this led to 90% reduction in particle release compared with HEV released from wild-type ORF2 and ORF3. ORF3[CCC11-13AAA] and ORF3[IFI59-61AAA exhibited a significant decrease in ion flux across the membrane compared with wild-type ORF3. none of these mutants, including ORF3[CCC11-13AAA] and ORF3[IFI59-61AAA, displayed vastly different subcellular localization compared with wild-type ORF3. supernatants were collected and used to infect nave HepG2C3A cells. the putative transmembrane regions (TM) are underlined. the asterisk marks the serine residue of ORF3, which can be phosphorylated. wild type or alanine mutants of HEV ORF3 expressed in X. laevis oocytes localize to the plasma membrane. water-injected and mRNA-injected oocytes were immunolabeled with polyclonal ORF3 antibody. viroporin-defective viruses are often impaired in their ability to properly assemble and release infectious particles (31\u201336) viroporin insertion in cellular membranes may disrupt electrochemical gradient by facilitating ion fluxes across membranes. viroporin insertion in cellular membranes may disrupt electrochemical gradient by facilitating ion fluxes across membranes. viroporins are attractive targets for antiviral therapy. long alkyl iminosugar derivatives block HCV p7 function and decrease the release of infectious virions. there are currently no specific drugs approved for the treatment of hepatitis E that directly interfere with the viral life cycle. all experiments involving oocytes derived from X. laevis were performed in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Rutgers University. cell lysates were prepared from 5 106 cells in a 10-mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5) containing 0.1% Nonidet P-40 and 1 mM EDTA, along with a mixture of protease and phosphatase inhibitors. mRNA was synthesized using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE high-yield capped RNA transcription SP6 kit (Ambion) the oocytes were first bathed in standard Ringer solution (115 mM NaCl, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM HEPS, pH 7.4) oocytes were clamped at 80 mV, followed by a 1-s depolarization to +20 mV. the voltage was then stepped to test voltages ranging from 80 to +50 mV in 10-mV increments. all experiments involving oocytes derived from X. laevis were performed.
