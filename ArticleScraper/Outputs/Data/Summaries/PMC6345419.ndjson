{"summary": "by the early 1990s, china exhibited some of the world\u2019s highest prevalence rates of parasitic and other tropical diseases. the findings included estimates that more than 0.5 billion people were infected with ascariasis, whereas approximately 200 million people suffered from trichuriasis and hookworm infection. transmitted helminth infections (STHs), schistosomiasis [5], malaria [9], and lymphatic filariasis has significantly increased. imported malaria and other parasitic infections have been brought into China from Africa or other endemic countries. endemic STHs and schistosomiasis have been historically widespread in China. endemic in 12 provinces of the Yangtze River valley, with 11.6 million infected individuals and over 100 million people under threat of infection. china has implemented comprehensive national campaigns to control the prevalence of schistosomiasis in humans and livestock. the number of infected human cases has dropped to 54,454 in 2016 with no new acute cases reported [18]. endemic countries with only 3 cases of indigenous malaria were imported in 2017. this is associated with a shift in malaria species from predominantly P. vivax to P. falciparum. the severe malaria cases and deaths remain at similar levels due to the increased proportion of imported malaria cases. the current national infection rate is 1.7%, with an estimated infected population of 22.3 million with 200,000 disability-adjusted life year lost. for trichinellosis, the infected population is estimated over 20 million. for trichinellosis, the infected population is estimated over 20 million. a significant downside of increased investments and trade in Africa has been an increase in imported parasitic infections. the major STHs\u2014ascariasis, trichuriasis, and hookworm infection\u2014have been historically widespread in China and have had a major role in interfering with economic and social advancement [12] schistosomiasis was highly endemic in 12 provinces of the Yangtze River valley. it was highly endemic in 12 provinces of the Yangtze River valley. the number of infected human cases has dropped to 54,454 in 2016. in 2016 alone, there were 3,321 malaria cases reported; 3,317 of them were imported from africa or other endemic countries with only 3 cases of indigenous malaria [23] there was no indigenous malaria case reported in China in 2017; all of the malaria cases were imported [24]. this is associated with a shift in malaria species from predominantly P. vivax to P. falciparum. the current national infection rate is 1.7%, with an estimated infected population of 22.3 million with 200,000 disability-adjusted life year lost. for trichinellosis, the infected population is estimated over 20 million, with 40 million people at risk in China, and more than 2 billion Chinese yuan spent on inspection and quarantine of pigs annually. a significant downside of increased investments and trade in Africa has been an increase in imported parasitic infections including intestinal schistosomiasis (caused by Schistosoma mansoni), loiasis, African trypanosomiasis (caused by Schistosoma mansoni), loiasis, African trypanosomiasis (33\u201337) and falciparum malaria. comprehensive control measures For the future control of STHs, there is an urgent need to continue implementing mass drug administration approaches using albendazole and mebendazole. high rates of post-treatment reinfection and variable efficacies of benzimidazole anthelminthics suggest the need for alternative technologies, including better drugs or even anthelminthic vaccines. a wide range of NTDs are emerging in countries along the Belt and Road Initiative. a wide range of NTDs are emerging in the conflict zones of Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen. a wide range of NTDs are emerging in the conflict zones of Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen. there is a need to expand monitoring and disease surveillance. there is a need to establish tropical disease control and surveillance centers in major urban areas of China. a wide range of NTDs are emerging in the conflict zones of Syria, Iraq, Libya, and Yemen. diseases East Africa South-Southeast Asia Middle East Russia-Kazakhstan-Central Asia West China (One Road start) malaria Visceral leishmaniasis Cutaneous leishmaniasis Schistosomiasis Food-borne helminthiasis Echinococcosis MERS Dengue and arbovirus Abbreviations. tropical diseases affect china's neglected tropical diseases (NTDs)."}
