{"summary": "the oxidized form of graphene, or graphene oxide (GO, Fig. 1), has been extensively explored in both basic and biomedical research. studies have demonstrated that the GO surface may interact through pi-pi stacking and hydrogen bonding interactions with various biomolecules. the nano-sized GO (nGO, 50\u2013300 nm) has been engineered for use in intracellular delivery. the mechanism underlying GO cellular uptake remains to be determined. however, endocytosis appears to be involved in the process. strong adsorption of single-stranded nucleotides to GO is mediated by pi-pi stacking interactions between the aromatic rings in the exposed bases that constitute single-stranded nucleotides. dsDNA cannot interact with GO because the bases of dsDNA are located inside the double helix within the negatively charged phosphate backbone. ribavirin is a nucleoside-mimicking derivative that causes lethal mutations in the virus during RNA replication and indirectly contributes to sustaining the immune response against HCV genotypes 1, 2 and 3. however, this pharmacological intervention has shown only limited efficacy with significant side effects. the available helicase assay systems are incompatible with high-throughput formats. many technologies have been developed to measure helicase activity in vitro. some antiviral candidates identified by currently available helicase assays exhibited poor activity in cell-based analysis. a multiplexed helicase assay platform based on GO (called mGOHA) exhibits robust sensibility and high-throughput compatibility. mGOHA employs SCV helicase and HCV NS3 helicase in a single mixed solution with DNA substrates labeled with two distinct fluorescent dyes. mGOHA was demonstrated to be a successful high-throughput screening method. two different helicases selectively recognize cognate dsDNA substrates labeled with two distinct fluorescent dyes. the new assay enables quantitative, reliable, and real-time monitoring of helicase activity. direct-acting antiviral agents will be harnessed to identify other helicase inhibitors."}
