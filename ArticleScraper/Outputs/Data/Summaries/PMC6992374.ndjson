{"summary": "coVs have the largest nonsegmented genomes among all RNA viruses, reaching up to 30 kb in length. the large genomes enhance plasticity, allowing modification by mutations and recombination. major reason for this phenomenon may be the numerous subgenomic RNAs generated during viral replication. bat CoVs are highly prevalent around the world and show great genetic diversity, making up almost 60% of all known species. it is generally believed that some of these bat CoVs have the potential to spill over into humans and other mammalian species. surveillance programs have been designed to aid viral discovery in wildlife reservoir hosts to mitigate infection and emergence in the human population. RESULTS Enrichment NGS aids in the detection and characterization of diverse CoVs. it is not time or cost-effective to perform unbiased NGS on all samples. most data generated from unbiased NGS can be attributed to non-CoV-specific reads. ine epidemic diarrhea virus [PEDV], transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus [TGEV], and mouse hepatitis virus [MHV] were amplified in cell culture. RNA was extracted from 3 clinical samples (oral swabs from humans infected with human coV OC43 [HCoV-OC43], HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-NL63) cell culture supernatant or human oral swabs subjected to NGS analysis. scale of read depth is shown as seven thin circular lines and ranges from 0 to 106. enrichment NGS can be retrospectively complemented with unbiased NGS and/or additional Sanger sequencing to obtain full-length genomes. the full-length genome was obtained with unbiased NGS. enrichment NGS decreases the amount of data requiring analysis. the NGS pipeline was assessed for CoV discovery in bat samples. full-length genome coverage obtained for six of nine genomes without further gap filling. more than 75% genome coverage was obtained for another 3 samples. targeted enrichment is a valuable tool to triage samples for further processing. the nucleotide sequence similarities were 97%, 96%, 96%, 89%, 85%, 91%, and 90%. the genomes of newly identified viruses were compared to their respective reference genomes at the nucleotide level. the x axis illustrates typical genes in a CoV genome. the gray vertical line represents a breakpoint in most of the bat CoV species. the genes were adjusted to be the same length as some CoVs have longer genomes. most data generated from unbiased NGS can be attributed to non-CoV-specific reads. we used a pool of 4,303 unique baits in conjunction with viral nucleic acid capture specifically targeting most of the known CoVs. the baits were designed from 90 representative CoV genomes. the 17 captured samples were made into two pools (8 or 9 per pool) for sequencing. the total amount of data obtained was variable across samples, but in swabs, unbiased NGS consistently produced more data. the high ratio of viral to total reads increased by almost 100% for captured samples. enrichment NGS can be retrospectively complemented with unbiased NGS and/or additional Sanger sequencing to obtain full-length genomes. full-length genomes were obtained by NGS for the five cultured viruses and with minimal further gap filling for HCoV-HKU1 (240 bp), HCoV-NL63 (566 bp), and HCoV-OC43 (2,465 bp) read depth for SARSr-CoV, MERS-CoV more data were obtained from unbiased NGS. but a higher ratio of viral to total reads was observed after enrichment. reads were obtained for BtRaCoV-229Er and BtScCoV-512r. ment clearly identified the presence of CoVs in bat samples. nine bat CoV-positive samples from previous viral surveillances were used. the nucleotide sequence similarities were 97%, 96%, 96%, 89%, 85%, 91%, and 90% for BtPiCoV-HKU5r, BtTyCoV-HKU4r, BtMiCoV-1r, BtRhCoV-HKU2r, BtRaCoV-229Er, BtScCoV-512r, and BtMiCoV-HKU8r respectively. the most divergent region of the genome was the region encoding the N terminus of the spike protein, which is usually responsible for receptor binding. in this region, seven of eight genomes showed less than 90% nucleotide identity, and five were below 40% nucleotide identity. the most divergent, BtMiCoV-HKU8r, shared less than 10% sequence identity in this region. the approximate per-sample cost of HiSeq NGS was $100. the cost of enrichment NGS in a 10-plex sample format was approximately $60. the cost of capture NGS can be greatly reduced when dealing with multiple samples, due to the low data cost. the depth of coverage obtained by enrichment NGS was expectedly dependent on the quantity of viral RNA in the sample. the technical procedure of the capture is itself a limitation of enrichment NGS (15, 18) key steps in the hybridization protocol could result in the loss of viral nucleic acid. the spike gene has the lowest bait coverage across the genome. characterization of the full-length genome is important. recombination has been documented for human CoVs. we previously provided serological evidence that HKU8r-CoV had jumped over from bats to camels and recombined with MERS-CoV, alerting other researchers that the CoV species could be dangerous (22). therefore, analysis of the short RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region is not sufficient and genome-level comparison is needed to monitor the risk of alterations in species tropism and pathogenesis. tMiCoV-HKU8r, BtHpCoV-HKU10r, BtHpCoV-CHB25, BtScCoV-512r, BtRaCoV-229Er, BtRhCoV-HKU2r, and BtTyCoV-HKU4r were extracted from bat rectal swabs (11, 23, 24) to process RNA, 560 l of buffer AVL (Qia libraries for NGS were constructed from total RNA using the TruSeq stranded mRNA library preparation kit for Illumina. library was amplified by PCR using conditions: initial denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 30 s, 10 cycles of denaturation for 10 s at 98\u00b0C, annealing for 30 s at 60\u00b0C, and extension for 30 s at 72\u00b0C. half the library was sequenced directly to obtain the unbiased reads. libraries were ethanol precipitated and resuspended in 2.5 l of nuclease-free H2O, 3 l NimbleGen hybridization solution, and 7.5 l NimbleGen 2 hybridization buffer. resuspended libraries were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and cooled on ice. eluted in 10 l nuclease-free H2O, visualized on a 1.5% agarose gel, and quantified using a Bioanalyzer high-sensitivity DNA assay (Agilent) each unbiased library was run on one HiSeq lane. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to fill the genome gaps. Graphs displaying the data size and viral read ratios were generated using Circos (version 0.69.8) Viral genome data for new CoVs obtained from this study are available in GenBank under accession numbers MN611517 to MN611525. control viruses were cultured for RNA extraction. qPCR was added to the tube containing 140 l swab sample or culture supernatant. samples were vortexed for 15 s and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min. RNA was reverse transcribed using PrimeScript RT master mix. libraries were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Genomics) and eluted in 20 l nuclease-free H2O. library was amplified by PCR using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98\u00b0C for 30 s, 10 cycles of denaturation for 10 s at 98\u00b0C, annealing for 30 s at 60\u00b0C, and extension for 30 s at 72\u00b0C enriched libraries were denatured at 95\u00b0C for 10 min and cooled on ice. a total of 3 pmol of baits was added and hybridized to the libraries for 4 h at 65\u00b0C. enriched libraries were run on one HiSeq lane. PCR and Sanger sequencing were used to fill the genome gaps. the search parameters were set to ignore nested ORFs and filter out ORFs of less than 150 bp. each ORF was identified and annotated using the NCBI database."}
