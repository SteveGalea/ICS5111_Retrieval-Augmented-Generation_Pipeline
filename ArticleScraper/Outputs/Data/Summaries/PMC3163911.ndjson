{"summary": "asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic SARS-CoV infections have been reported in many places. the host genetic background is an important factor that determines the susceptibility to and pathogenicity of SARS infection. the involvement of the major histocompatibility complex class I gene (HLA) and the L-SIGN gene (CLEC4M) are still disputed. the translation elongation factor 1 (EEF1A) [24], cytochrome p450 subfamily 4F polypeptide 3 (CYP4F3, Gene ID 4051, GenBank ID NG_007964.1) and alpha-2-HS-glycoprotein (AHSG, Gene ID 197, GenBank ID NG_007964.1) were found to interact with the nucleocapsid protein of SARS-CoV. human serum (100 l) was incubated with agarose beads conjugated to GST-N protein or GST at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. the beads were washed three times with PBS supplemented with 0.1% NP40. the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-AHSG antibody. DNA was extracted from all the samples selected. all cases and controls were Han Chinese. most of the population was composed of female nurses between the ages of 16 and 30. the rs2248690 TT/AT genotype was more associated with increased susceptibility to SARS than the AA genotype. the rs2248690 TT/AT genotype was more associated with increased susceptibility to SARS than the AA genotype (OR = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.30\u20134.51; Table 2 and Table S1). the TT genotype of rs2248690 had a frequency of 27.5% in the control population and a significantly higher frequency of 39.1% in the SARS patients. rs4917 and rs2248690 are in high linkage disequilibrium (0.62), the association can be easily understood. we tested the deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both cases and controls, within each cohort and within the overall study population. the association results for rs2248690 in two independent samples and the combined sample. a combined group of minor-allele homozygotes and heterozygotes was compared with the major-allele homozygotes group (CT+TT) vs. CC. the association results for rs4917 in two independent samples and the combined sample. Cohorts compared Genotype No. Controls (%) No. Controls (%) Crude ORa (95% CI) Pa Value Adjusted ORb (95% CI) Pb Value HCW Cases vs. HCW Controls AA 25 (62.50) 88 (72.10) 1[Reference] 1[Reference] TT/AT 15 (37.50) 34 (27.90) 1.55 (0.73\u20133.30) 0.32 1.54 (0.72\u20133.2 rs2248690 is associated with AHSG serum concentration AHSG is a serum protein. it has been reported that there is an association between AHSG polymorphisms (rs4917 and rs4918) and AHSG serum concentration levels. no convincing multivariate analysis has been performed to identify most associated variants. rs2248690 is located in the promoter region of the AHSG gene. it has been reported that the A allele of rs2248690 has a reduced binding affinity for transcription factor AP1 [34], which is a repressor of AHSG expression. the sequence that contained 799T showed significantly lower promoter activity. SARS-Cov nucleocapsid protein associates with CYP4F3A, EEF1A and AHSG. human serum was incubated with agarose beads conjugated to GST-N protein or GST at 4\u00b0C for 2 h. the bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblot with anti-AHSG antibody. the control samples from Guangzhou and Beijing were collected during the 2003 SARS epidemic. all samples were collected from people who had never developed SARS. DNA was extracted from all the samples selected. rs2248690 TT/AT genotype was more associated with increased susceptibility to SARS than the AA genotype. rs2248690 TT/AT genotype was more associated with increased susceptibility to SARS than the AA genotype (OR = 2.42; 95% CI, 1.30\u20134.51; Table 2 and Table 2). the TT/CT genotype of rs4917 was associated with an increased possibility of developing clinically apparent SARS (OR = 1.84; 95% CI, 1.02\u20133.34; Table 3 and Table S1). rs2248690 polymorphism was significantly associated with SARS development (relative to the TT/AT genotype, 1.63; 95% CI, 1.30\u20132.04; Table 2 and Table S1). the distribution of different genotypes between the HCW cases and HCW controls is similar to the distribution between the non-HCW cases and non-HCW controls with a difference of approximately 10%. the statistical analysis of the rs2248690 genotype data from all cases and HCW controls confirmed this finding. a combined group of minor-allele homozygotes and heterozygotes was compared with the major-allele homozygotes group (AT+TT) vs. AA); multivariate unconditional logistic regression was used. the association results for rs4917 in two independent samples and the combined sample. a combined group of minor-allele homozygotes and heterozygotes was compared with the major-allele homozygotes group (CT+TT) vs. CC); multivariate unconditional logistic regression was used. the frequency of the C allele was compared to the frequency of the T allele. rs2248690 is associated with AHSG serum concentration AHSG is a serum protein. rs4917 and rs4918 were associated with different serum levels of AHSG. no convincing multivariate analysis has been performed. rs2248690 is located in the promoter region of the AHSG gene. it has been reported that the A allele of rs2248690 has a reduced binding affinity for transcription factor AP1 [34], which is a repressor of AHSG expression [36], [36]. rs3794987 GG/AG genotype was associated with increased susceptibility to SARS. but the results of this association were not replicated in the Beijing population. rs2248690 AA is associated with higher AHSG serum levels. rs2248690 is the dominant factor affecting AHSG concentration. AHSG is a circulating negative inflammatory acute-phase glycoprotein. pathophysiological sequence of infection is mediated by macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory cytokines. AHSG is a circulating glycoprotein synthesized in human liver tissue. AHSG is so abundant in the serum (0.2\u20130.55 mg/ml) interactions between AHSG and the nucleocapsid protein are less likely to affect the viral infectivity and replication of the SARS-CoV. the association of the AHSG genotype and AHSG serum concentrations was evaluated in 192 healthy Beijing Han Chinese. all of the SARS patients were seropositive for SARS antibodies. the specificity of the ELISA assay was higher than 99%. the remaining 272 samples of SARS patients were collected from the Ditan Hospital. all of these health care workers worked in SARS wards in the second Affiliated Hospital of Senyaxian Medical School in 2003. the AHSG gene has more than 30 SNPs in three linkage disequilibrium blocks. we chose rs2248690 (5\u2032-flanking region), rs2077119 (5\u2032-flanking region), rs4917 (exon 6), rs2593813 (intron 1), and rs4918 (exon 7) for genotyping. the error rate was determined by DNA sequencing (3730, Applied Biosystem Inc) for 10% of the SNPs examined in the present study. the exact test was applied to evaluate whether the population was in Hardy\u2013Weinberg equilibrium by the Markov chain method. horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -conjugated anti-human AHSG antibodies were added to the wells. all samples were measured in parallel and in duplicate. the intra- and inter-assay coefficients of variations were below 10%. the data shown represent three independent experiments performed in triplicate. the statistical analyses were performed using the Student's t-test. adsorbates were washed with lysis buffer and subjected to immunoblot analysis. case-control study 2 Blood samples from 624 patients diagnosed by WHO standards were collected from Xiaotangshan Hospital (a hospital temporarily set up to fight SARS in Beijing, China) all cases and controls were Han Chinese. study Blood samples from 192 healthy Beijing Chinese were collected from the 307 Hospital of PLA. serum AHSG levels were assessed by ELISA, and the rs2248690 loci were genotyped as described below. the CYP4F3 gene has more than 30 SNPs in three linkage disequilibrium blocks. we chose rs3794987 (5\u2032-flanking region), rs1159776 (5\u2032-flanking region), rs4646519 (intron 11), and rs1290625 (intron 2) for genotyping. the method combines solution-phase multiplex single nucleotide extension (SNE) with a solid-phase sort tag SNPs were chosen on a pairwise basis, and the linkage disequilibrium calculation was performed on a confidence interval (CI) basis. the odds ratio and a 95% CI were used to measure association strength in the genetic risk association study. plasmids encompassing 1091 to +22 bp of the human AHSG promoter were generated by PCR from two genomic DNA samples with either 799A OR -799T. the PCR product was digested with BglII and HindIII and ligated into a pGL3-basic promoter-probing vector (promega) the constructs were sequenced to ensure correct cloning. Purified AHSG protein was included as a loading control. supporting information table S1 The Additive model of Crude and adjusted Odd Ratios (ORs) by AHSG and CYP4F3 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) Genotypes."}
