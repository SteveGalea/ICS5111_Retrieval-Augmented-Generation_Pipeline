{"summary": "angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)2 shares 42% of its amino acidic sequence identity in its catalytic domain. ACE2 hydrolyzes AngII (angiotensin II) to generate Ang1\u20137, a peptide that binds to the MAS receptor (Ang1-7 receptor) and activates vasodilation, anti-fibrosis, anti-proliferation, and anti-inflammatory effects. ACE2 and ACE enzymes have been found to be altered in the kidney from different diabetic experimental models, the db/db (type 2) and streptozotozin (type 1) diabetic mice. ACE2 and ACE enzymes have not been extensively studied in other tissues from diabetic mice. hosphate Buffer (PB) and Borate Buffer (BB) were incubated with increasing amounts of hrACE. the hrACE activity measurement was found to be linear with BB. PB needed higher amounts of hrACE for its detection. ACE2 activity was measured in lung (black rhombus), heart (blue triangle), pancreas (green circle) and liver (red cross) from control animals (CONT) and diabetic animals (DB) mice. ACE2 activity was measured in lung (black rhombus), heart (blue triangle), pancreas (green circle), and liver (red cross) ACE activity in lungs from DB mice at early and late stages of diabetes as compared to CONT mice (p = NS) no statistically significant differences were observed in ACE activity in DB as compared to their respective CONT mice (p = NS) ACE activity was also tested in liver. insulin administration significantly decreased ACE2 activity in DB mice at early and late stages (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001) in lung homogenates, no changes were observed between DB and CONT mice (p = 0.05) at cardiac level, there was a significant increase of ACE2 activity in DB mice in both early and late stages of DB as compared to DB mice. ACE2/ACE activity ratios were calculated for each studied tissue to infer the status of RAS in different tissues as an ACE-ACE2 balance. in serum samples, ACE2/ACE activity ratio in DB mice at early and late stages was higher as compared to CONT (p = 0.001) in lung, there were no differences in ACE2/ACE activity ratio between the DB and CONT groups at early stage. ACE2/ACE activity ratio in heart, liver, and pancreas from CONT, DB, and DB + INS mice at 21 and 40 days after diabetes onset. ACE2/ACE activity ratio in heart, liver, and pancreas from CONT, DB, and DB + INS. ACE2 protein expression was significantly increased in DB mice at early stage as compared to CONT mice (p = 0.008) in heart, ACE2 protein expression was significantly increased in DB mice at late stage as compared to CONT mice (p = 0.008) in liver, ACE2 protein expression was significantly increased in DB mice at late stage as compared to CONT mice (p = 0.008) human recombinant ACE (hrACE) was incubated with increasing amounts of hrACE. ACE activity at lower hrACE amounts was only detected by the use of BB. PB needed higher amounts of hrACE for its detection. ACE2 activity was measured in lung (black rhombus), heart (blue triangle), pancreas (green circle) and liver (red cross) from control animals (CONT) and diabetic animals (DB) mice. ACE2 activity was measured in lung (black rhombus), heart (blue triangle), pancreas (green circle), and liver (red cross) ACE activity decreased in DB mice at both early and late stages of diabetes. ACE activity decreased in lungs from DB mice at both early and late stages. ACE activity decreased in lungs from DB mice at both early and late stages. insulin administration significantly decreased ACE2 activity in DB mice at early and late stages of diabetes. in lung homogenates, no changes were observed between DB and CONT mice. ACE2 activity was increased in DB mice as compared to CONT mice. ACE2/ACE activity ratios were calculated for each studied tissue to infer the status of RAS in different tissues as an ACE-ACE2 balance. in serum samples, ACE2/ACE activity ratio in DB mice at early and late stages was higher as compared to CONT. in lung, there were no differences in ACE2/ACE activity ratio between the DB and CONT groups at early stage. ACE2/ACE activity ratio in serum samples from CONT (open bars), DB (closed bars), and DB + INS (grey bars) mice at 21 and 40 days after diabetes onset. ACE2/ACE activity ratio in lungs from CONT, DB, and DB + INS mice. ACE2 protein expression was significantly increased in DB mice at early stage. insulin administration significantly decreased ACE2 protein expression in DB mice. in pancreas, there were no changes observed when ACE2 protein expression was studied. glucose levels positively correlated with ACE2/ACE ratio in serum (r = 0.455, p = 0.003) and negatively correlated with ACE2/ACE ratio in lung (r = 0.546, p = 0.0005) ACE2 has been shown to be increased in the kidney from different models of diabetic nephropathy, the STZ-diabetic model and the non-obese diabetic mice (NOD) previous studies have shown that ACE activity from the same samples differs depending on the homogenization buffer used. borate buffer is the most suitable to detect lower levels of ACE activity. ACE activity in lungs was higher as compared to other studied tissues. ACE2 activity was performed in serum, lung, heart, liver, pancreas, and kidney tissues by measuring the hydrolysis of Mca-APK(Dnp), a quenched-fluorescent specific ACE2-substrate. ACE2 activity levels were higher in pancreas as compared to other studied tissues. animal models NOD/ShiLtJ and NOR/LtJ female mice were housed in cages under 12 h light/dark cycle in a specific pathogen germ free environment. female mice only were used because the development of diabetes is more predictable in female than in male NOD mice [43] mouse Tissue Samples Studies were performed in serum, heart, lungs, liver, and pancreas. blood samples were obtained by intracardiac puncture and organs were perfused with Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution by transcardiac puncture. the plates were read using a fluorescence plate reader Tecan Infinite 200. results were expressed as RFU (relative Fluorescent Units) per L of serum or g of protein (RFU/L or RFU/g) immunoblotting Protein expression was analyzed by Western Blotting techniques using tissue homogenates. Briefly, 30 g of protein were denatured by heat shock. membranes were then incubated using primary antibodies for ACE. tJ and NOR/LtJ female mice were housed in cages under 12 h light/dark cycle in a specific pathogen germ free environment. female mice only were used because the development of diabetes is more predictable in female than in male NOD mice. mouse Tissue Samples Studies were performed in serum, heart, lungs, liver, and pancreas. blood samples were obtained by intracardiac puncture and organs were perfused with Phosphate-buffered saline solution by transcardiac puncture. serum, 2 L of sample were used and for tissues, between 5 and 10 g of total protein were analyzed depending on the tissue. results were expressed as RFU (Relative Fluorescent Units) per L of sample or g of protein. samples were loaded into 8% acrylamide/bisacrylamide gel and transferred to hydrophobic PVDF (polyvinylidenedifluoride) membranes. membranes were blocked using 5% skimmed milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.1% Tween-20 for 1 h at room temperature. membranes were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies."}
