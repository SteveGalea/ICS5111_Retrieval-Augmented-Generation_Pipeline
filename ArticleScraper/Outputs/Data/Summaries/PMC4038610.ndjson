{"summary": "coronaviruses are enveloped viruses and their positive strand RNA genome, the largest of all RNA viruses, encode for as many as 16 non-structural proteins (nsps), 4 major structural proteins, and up to 8 accessory proteins. many of these proteins provide essential, frequently enzymatic, functions during the viral life cycle and are therefore attractive targets for antiviral intervention. coronavirus genome, a positive sense, capped and polyadenylated RNA strand, is directly translated resulting in the synthesis of coronavirus replicase gene-encoded nsps. coronavirus nsps are translated as two large polyproteins harboring proteolytic enzymes. these proteolytic functions are considered essential for coronavirus replication and attractive targets for antiviral intervention. three coronaviral nsps, i.e., nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 [9], [36], [37] are thought to participate in formation of these sites for viral RNA synthesis. these proteins contain multiple trans-membrane domains that are thought to anchor the coronavirus replication complex through recruitment of intracellular membranes to form a reticulovesicular network (RVN) of modified, frequently a novel inhibitor of coronavirus replication is characterized by severe impairment of DMV formation that results in near-complete inhibition of RNA synthesis. this novel mode-of-action is characterized by severe impairment of DMV formation that results in near-complete inhibition of RNA synthesis. the inhibitor displayed antiviral activity against a broad range of animal and human coronaviruses, including the recently emerging MERS-CoV. phenylprop-1-en-2-yl)benzamide was completely soluble in medium up to 50 M. the concentration of K22 that inhibited the number of HCoV-229E plaques by 50% (IC50) was 0.7 M. MRC-5 cells were inoculated with HCoV-229E at a moi of 0.05 for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. MRC-5 cells were harvested after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C. the viral RNA (E) and infectivity (F) determined. the virus was incubated with 70 IC50 doses of K22 or DMSO solvent for 15 min at 37\u00b0C, followed by virus dilution and its titration at non-inhibitory compound concentrations. similar titers were observed for the virus treated with K22 (7.2105/ml8.9%) and DMSO (7.5105/ml4.7%) (n = 2; two experiments), indicating that K22 exhibited no virus particle-inactivating activity plaque purified several variants displaying moderate (2-fold) to strong (12-fold) K22 resistance (IC50 of 1.6\u20138.5 M; Table 1). Whole genome sequencing analysis of wild type (wt) HCoV-229E, mock passaged virus, and K22 passaged virus revealed two amino acid substitutions within nsp 6 (H121L; M159V) that were associated with strong K22 resistance (Table 1). RNA was comparable between K22-resistant mutants and parental wt HCoV-229E. production of infectious particles during infection was greatly reduced. this difference cannot be attributed to the presence of free viral RNA in preparation of extracellular virus.

MRC-5 cells were inoculated with nsp6 recombinant HCoV-229EH121L, HCoV-229EM159V, HCoV-229EH121L/M159V or wild-type HCoV-229E at a MRC-5 cells were inoculated with nsp6 recombinant HCoV-229EH121L, HCoV-229EM159V, HCoV-229EH121L/M159V or wild-type HCoV-229E at an moi of 0.05 for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. copy numbers of cell-associated (CA; D) or extracellular (EX; E) viral RNA and infectivity (F) was no DMV clusters or viral particles were detected in wt HCoV-229E-infected cells. double-stranded (ds) RNA is indicative of coronavirus replication. we stained HCoV-229E-infected cells for viral replicase complexes and dsRNA. nsp6, like nsp4, has a pivotal role in coronavirus DMV formation. this efficient block in replication can be overcome by resistance mutations in nsp6, and that of the structurally similar compound J15. this efficient block in replication can be overcome by resistance mutations in nsp6 mutant viruses. MRC-5 cells were infected with wild type HCoV-229E (WT) and K22-resistant recombinants HCoV-229EM159V (M159V) each image shown was selected from a pool of over 30 images. each image shown was selected from a pool of over 30 images captured in three separate experiments. rapamycin-incuced autophagocytic vesicles were again readily detectable in the presence of K22 (20 M), suggesting that K22 does not impact cellular autophagy. we corroborated this result by immunofluorescence analysis of Huh7 cells stained for endogenous LC3B at six hours post addition of rapamycin. origin in the K22 concentration range assessed, and analysis of K22 cytostatic activities in the cell proliferation assay revealed CC50 values 40 M. the efficacy of K22-mediated inhibition varied amongst different coronaviruses. however, whether this is related to nsp6 function would require generation and analysis of K22 resistant variants for all coronaviruses tested. two independent experiments performed in triplicate (cell viability) were performed using antibodies directed against (G) dsRNA (green), and DAPI (cell nucleus; blue), and (H) dsRNA, DAPI, -tubulin (ciliated cells; white), and ZO1 (tight junctions, red) Scale bars are 50 (G) or 20 (H) m. inhibition of HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV in primary human HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV infections were inhibited by K22 treatment. this result shows that the broad anti-coronaviral activity of K22 makes this compound particularly promising for the development of efficacious treatment options for emerging coronaviruses. MRC-5 cells by >50% (CC50) at a concentration range of 0.032\u2013500 M (Figure 1C) however this compound decreased proliferation of MRC-5 cells with a CC50 value of 110 M. the selective index for K22, i.e. the CC50/IC50 quotient, was 157. MRC-5 cells were inoculated with HCoV-229E at a moi of 0.05 for 45 min at 4\u00b0C, and K22 (10 M) added at specific time points relative to the end of inoculation period. a time-of-addition/removal experiment was performed. with K22 (7.2105/ml8.9%) and DMSO (7.5105/ml4.7%), the 50% reduction in plaque number is likely due to cellular uptake of K22. this idea is further corroborated by the most pronounced inhibition of HCoV-229E replication when K22 was added after infection. HCoV-229E, mock passaged virus, and K22 passaged virus revealed two amino acid substitutions within nsp 6 (H121L; M159V) that were associated with strong K22 resistance. nsp6 homologs of HCoV-229E and other coronaviruses used in this study revealed presence of 7 potential membrane-spanning domains. mutations conferring resistance to K22 are located in or near these regions. the treatment of HCoV-229EM159V mutant virus with ribonuclease A did not reduce the quantity of viral RNA. this observation suggests that K22 resistance-conferring mutations in nsp6 are associated with a fitness cost.

MRC-5 cells were infected with wild type HCoV-229E (WT) and K22-resistant recombinants HCoV-229EH121L (H121L), HCoV-229EM159V (M159V), and HCoV-229EH121L/M159V (H121L/M159V) irrespective of the addition of K22 rapamycin-incuced autophagocytic vesicles were again readily detectable in the presence of K22 (20 M), suggesting that K22 does not impact cellular autophagy. we assessed the antiviral activity of K22 against a panel of diverse coronaviruses representing major phylogenetic lineages of -, - and\"\"-coronaviruses. K22 exhibited little or no effect on replication of poliovirus. a pathogen that like coronaviruses induces rearrangement of cellular membranes to assist RNA replication. HCoV-229E and MERS-CoV infections were infected with a recombinant HCoV-229E expressing Renilla luciferase as marker for virus replication. by february 2014 the number of laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection reported to the world health organization exceeded 182. K22-mediated inhibition of coronavirus replication confirms that the employment of host cell membranes for viral RNA synthesis is a crucial step in the coronavirus life cycle. however, resistance conferring mutations in nsp6 emerged only after 10\u201313 consecutive passages of HCoV-229E under K22 selection. this suggests that escape mutations in membrane domain-containing coronavirus nsps compatible with maintaining efficient RNA synthesis are limited. dsRNA is localized in DMVs and nsp6 escape mutants induced decreased number of DMVs that are structurally impaired. the reduced specific infectivity of these viruses could be related to dsRNA-triggered innate immune responses. nsp6 mutants generated decreased number of DMVs that are structurally impaired. in nsp6, further binding experiments are required to clarify whether K22 targets nsp6 directly. we observed that K22 is most active in inhibiting replication of the tested -coronaviruses (HCoV-229E, FCoV) and the -coronavirus IBV, whereas amongst -coronaviruses K22 was highly active in inhibiting MERS-CoV. co-expression of nsp2, nsp4 and nsp6 is required to produce coronavirus-like membrane rearrangements including DMVs. nsp3, nsp4 or nsp6 induces aberrant membrane rearrangements that mimic membrane structures known from coronavirus infection. nsp3, nsp4 or nsp6 is required to produce membrane rearrangements including DMVs. the identification of K22 is only the very first step towards an approved drug for therapeutic use in animals or humans. we are currently focusing on the structure-activity relationship analysis of K22 analogs. the antiviral activity against a number of diverse coronaviruses makes K22 an ideal candidate for further development towards an efficacious \u201cpan-coronavirus inhibitor\u201d cells and viruses human embryonic lung diploid fibroblasts (MRC-5), African green monkey kidney cells (Vero), baby hamster kidney cells (BHK-21), felis catus whole fetus 4 cells (FCWF-4) were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), murine fibroblast cells (L929) and African green monkey kidney cells (CV-1) were purchased from the European Collection of Cell Cultures.
