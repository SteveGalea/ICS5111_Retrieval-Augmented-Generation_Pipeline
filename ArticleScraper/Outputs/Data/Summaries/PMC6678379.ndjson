{"summary": "a total of 2374 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported to the world health organization (WHO) from April 2012 through February 2019, a total of 2374 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported by 27 countries. the majority of cases were reported by Saudi Arabia, with 745 deaths, 37.56%). the number of camels in Saudi Arabia is estimated at more than 1.39 million heads [13] and has been growing annually by 5.2% since 1961. the project will help improve camel health and control the spread of zoonotic diseases. no permanent and sustained human-to-human transmission has been observed. a preliminary transmission risk map of MERS-CoV was produced across the Middle East by analyzing the spatial distribution of MERS-CoV cases and environmental transmission risk factors. this suggests that the transmission route of the disease via camel exposure plays a major role. however, the effects of environmental risk factors on disease transmission were not explicitly determined. study aimed to examine the spatiotemporal clustering of the MERS-CoV incidence in Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2019. a confirmed case is defined as a suspected case that has a laboratory confirmation of MERS-CoV infection. ERS-CoV patient was recently identified, or has had a history of contact with dromedary camels or consumption of camel products within 14 days before symptoms. a primary case is defined as a person with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection with no evidence of contact with infected individuals. a secondary case is defined as a person who has shared the same enclosed space for frequent or extended periods with an individual with a symptomatic MERS-CoV spatial data The spatial database of the MERS-CoV incidence in Saudi Arabia was created in the format of an ESRI file geodatabase on the three spatial levels of city, governorate and province. the prevalence of intrinsic variance instability in estimating incidence rates as a result of the variation in populations across spatial units has received broad attention. purely temporal, seasonal, purely spatial and spatiotemporal analyses were conducted using the Poisson discrete-based model with 999 Monte Carlo permutations. the latter ignores the year of the observation and retains only the day and month [40] for temporal analysis, values of 1 day, 1 month and 1 year were set as the time aggregation units for the daily, monthly and annual clusters. for the seasonal cluster, 1 month was set for the monthly and annual spatiotemporal analyses, respectively. laboratory testing for MERS-CoV is performed at approved regional SMOH and selected non-SMOH governmental laboratories to confirm a clinically suspected case. a primary case is defined as a person with a laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV infection with no evidence of contact with infected individuals. exposure to camels includes direct physical contact with camels or their surroundings. geodatabase was created in the format of an ESRI file geodatabase on the three spatial levels of city, governorate and province. the number of MERS-CoV incidence cases for the governorates was used as an event variable. the populations of governorates were estimated from the 2010 census and used as base variables. the number of MERS-CoV cases by city was used as the case file. the city population estimated from the 2010 census was used as the case file. the latitude and longitude of each city were used in the coordinates file. the null hypothesis is that the incidence of MERS-CoV is randomly distributed. total of 2008 laboratory-confirmed human MERS-CoV cases reported in Saudi Arabia during the period between June 2, 2012 and March 31, 2019 were included in this study. primary cases accounted for 24.05% (n = 483) of the total number of confirmed cases; of these, 48.24% (n = 233) involved (direct and indirect) exposure to camels. secondary cases accounted for 40.90% (n = 821) of the total number of confirmed cases. two minor outbreaks with fairly comparable numbers of MERS-CoV cases occurred in 2014, one in April (n = 253, 12.59%) and another in May (n = 213, 10.60%) sporadic MERS-CoV cases were also reported throughout the study period. in dh, the capital of Saudi Arabia, the incidence rate of MERS-CoV infection was 13.92 cases per 100,000 people. in Buraydah, alahsa and Jeddah governorates, the incidence rates were 13.04, 12.06 and 7.98 cases per 100,000 people, respectively. Spatial clusters in single cities were identified across the country. alhofuf (east), dumat aljundal (north), Najran (south), alqunfidhah (southwest), alhinakiyah (west) and Buraydah (southwest) represented the third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth secondary clusters. spatiotemporal clusters in single cities were also observed and varied in space and time across the country. Wadi Addawasir (2018\u20132019), Dumat Aljundal (2017\u20132018), Alhofuf (2015\u20132016), Buraydah (2015\u20132016) and Alhinakiyah (2014\u20132015) represented the second, third, fourth, fifth and sixth secondary clusters. sixth secondary 04/2014 to 06/2014 4 38 4 49 8.94 0.001 Figure 5. Locations of the monthly spatiotemporal clusters of MERS-CoV incidence in Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2019. a group of cities (n = 7) located in Riyadh province was identified as the most likely high-risk cluster for MERS-CoV incidence between April and may of 2014. 821) of the total number of confirmed cases. missing and unknown cases accounted for 18.02% (n = 362) and 17.03% (n = 342) of the total number of confirmed cases. most of the MERS-CoV cases in Saudi Arabia between 2012 and 2019 occurred in 2014. the incidence of MERS-CoV infection was mostly reported from Riyadh (n = 722, 35.95%), Jeddah (n = 276, 13.74%) and alahsa governorates (n = 129, 6.42%) the incidence in Wadi Addawasir, Buraydah, Taif, Alkharj, Najran, Madinah and Makkah governorates ranged from 51 to 81 cases. the data are for the governorate level, with the provincial boundaries overlaid. the results of the purely spatial cluster analysis of MERS-CoV incidence from 2012 to 2019 revealed the most significant and secondary clusters. cluster type no. of cities in cluster Observed Cases Expected Cases LLR Relative Risk p-Value Most likely 1 81 9 104 8.92 0.001 Secondary 2 70 15 55 4.92 0.001 Second secondary 1 128 67 23 1.97 0.001 Third secondary 1 21 3 21 6.42 0.001 Fourth secondary 1 68 30 18 2.30 0.001 Fifth secondary 1 14 2 13 5.67 0.001 Sixth secondary 1 11 2 11 6.52 0.001 Cluster Type Timeframe (year) No. of Cities in the Cluster Observed Cases Expected Cases LLR Relative Risk p-Value Most likely 2014 to 2016 10 491 163 245 3.67 0.001 Secondary 2014 to 2015 3 315 84 201 4.28 0.001 Second secondary 2018 to 2019 1 56 1 153 41.57 0.001 Third secondary 2017 to 2018 1 21 0 59 43.70 0.001 Fourth secondary 2015 to 2016 1 50 10 41 5. in the most recent MERS-CoV outbreaks, a single spatiotemporal second secondary cluster of MERS-CoV cases was identified in wadi addawasir in February 2019. a cluster of eight cities in the central-north of Saudi Arabia located in Qassim and Hail provinces was observed in March 2016. a total of 2008 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases were reported in Saudi Arabia, representing approximately 83% of the global cases. romedary camels have a higher risk of developing MERS-CoV infection via a primary source. only 48.24% of the total primarily infected cases were associated with direct or indirect contact with camels. recent trends in Saudi Arabia have indicated a tendency towards dromedary camel husbandry intensification since the 1960s. a recent serological study in Saudi Arabia found a higher risk of MERS-CoV infection in camels in winter than in summer. however, the low daily frequency and sporadic cases indicate a reduced likelihood of zoonotic-to-human transmission. the main MERS-CoV outbreaks in 2014 and 2015 were closely followed by human influenza A epidemics. the most likely high-risk MERS-CoV cluster for April and May 2014 could be attributed to several outbreaks. the most recent clusters of MERS-CoV incidence were identified in a single healthcare setting in Riyadh in August 2015. this indicates persistent challenges related to nosocomial transmission. the results of this study provide initial risk assessments that can be used as the basis for the further investigation of potential environmental risk factors. the immediate isolation of suspected patients, adequate infection control measures and early case diagnosis and management remain the principal elements in controlling the spread of the disease."}
