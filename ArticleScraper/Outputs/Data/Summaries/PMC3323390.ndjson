{"summary": "bubonic plague, a bacterial disease for which rats and fleas play a central role in transmission, has caused substantial illness and death around the world since ancient times. a possible epidemic of bubonic plague was described in the Old Testament, in the First Book of Samuel. zoonotic agents can be directly transmitted from wildlife to humans. rabies virus is transmitted by bite from a rabid animal. zoonoses with a wildlife origin are spread through insect vectors. salmonella spp. can also be spread from wildlife to humans in different ways. anthrax is spread by food and water contamination or by the spread of spores by flies, vultures and other scavengers. the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, which causes Lyme borreliosis, has its main reservoir among small rodents and uses various Ixodes species as vectors. the increasing incidence of Lyme borreliosis in the northeastern united states in recent years can be explained by reforestation that has favored transmission of the disease through increased populations of white-tailed deer and deer mice. infectious agents harbored within insects, animals, or humans can travel halfway around the globe in less time than it takes most diseases to incubate. the appearance of west Nile virus infection in 1999, and the subsequent spread within the united states, is an example of introduction and establishment of a pathogen that apparently originated in the Middle East (15). zoonosis is emerging in wildlife in many parts of the world. bovine tuberculosis was probably introduced into Africa with imported cattle during the colonial era and thereafter spread to and became endemic in wildlife (20) in Ireland and Great Britain, badgers maintain the infection, whereas the brushtail possum constitutes a main wildlife reservoir in new Zealand. monkeypox is a rare zoonosis caused by a poxvirus. transmission to humans occurs by contact with infected animals or body fluids. outbreak was epidemiologically linked to imported african rodents from Ghana. 8,098 cases, including 774 fatalities, have occurred during this epidemic. the virus has an unknown reservoir, but wildlife is a likely source of infection. natural infections with influenza A viruses have been reported in a variety of animal species. recognition and emergence of human tickborne ehrlichiosis are recent and continuing events, beginning with human monocytic ehrlichiosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. from 1994 to 2004, three zoonotic paramyxoviruses with a wildlife reservoir have emerged. humans are infected by close contact with infected pigs or horses. wildlife is an essential component in the epidemiology of many, if not most, zoonoses. better national surveillance systems for humans and animals are needed to detect new and emerging zoonoses. syndromic surveillance is warranted to detect new and emerging diseases. more research is needed to better understand the epidemiology and pathogenesis of various zoonoses. training and education are prerequisites to enable the personnel involved at the various stages, from field to laboratory personnel, to detect zoonoses, both new and old."}
