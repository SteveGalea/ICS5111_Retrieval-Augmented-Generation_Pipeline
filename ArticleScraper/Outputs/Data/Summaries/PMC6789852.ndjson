{"summary": "background Antibodies carry out a multitude of preventative and therapeutic antiviral activities. they can neutralize viral particles via their antigen binding fragment (Fab) domains. they can interact with innate immune receptors, such as crystallizable fragment-gamma receptors (FcRs) onized targets, phagocytosis and signaling via FcRs also lead to the secretion of antiviral cytokines. these functions have been implicated in the protection and control against many viruses, including influenza viruses [13], ebola virus (14,15) and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) [16]. a recent study found that for some bNAbs, such as PGT121, neutralization alone might be sufficient to protect from SHIV-infected cell challenges in rhesus macaques. despite this conclusion, there are still numerous lines of evidence suggesting the importance of Fc-mediated effector functions in eliminating HIV-1-infected cells. the level, specificity, isotype, and subclass of antibodies are characteristics that dictate the balance between Fc-mediated protection and disease progression. despite the recent surge in the study of Fc-mediated effector functions in controlling viral infections, there remain some understudied parameters. these include viral glycoprotein shedding that can redirect humoral immune responses from infected to uninfected cells and glycoprotein internalization that can modulate immune complex formation. this strategy of antigenic subversion by soluble glycoproteins has been described for many enveloped viruses, including HIV-1, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and EboV. the HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein (Env) trimer is composed of gp160 exterior and gp41 transmembrane subunits. significant levels of soluble gp120 can be found circulating in the blood and tissues of HIV-infected individuals. in vivo effects of shed gp120 binding to the surface of bystander lymphocytes have been suggested to serve as effective targets that contribute to decreased CD4+ T cell counts in HIV-1-infected individuals. in vitro ADCC assays can be greatly influenced by the redirection of ADCC towards uninfected CD4+ cells. imers share cross-reactive epitopes that sGP can compete for. sGP could divert Fc-mediated effector functions away from infected cells. findings highlight relevance of measuring impact of soluble form of Envs. the endocytosis and recycling of HIV-1 Env has been suggested to be an essential mechanism in Env incorporation within viral particles. a study by von Bredow et al. introduced mutations in these endocytic motifs and showed increased cell-surface expression of Env. this correlated with increased ADCC responses. bNAbs preferentially recognizing the \u2018closed\u2019/State 1 Env conformation triggered rapid Env internalization when compared to non-neutralizing antibodies that preferentially bound the \u2018open\u2019/State 2/3 Env conformation. bNAbs preferentially bound the \u2018open\u2019/State 1 Env conformation when compared to non-neutralizing antibodies that preferentially bound the \u2018open\u2019/State 1 Env conformation. a naturally occurring dimeric form of a potent neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibody, 2G12, containing four Fabs and two Fc regions, was previously shown to be more potent at mediating ADCC than its monomeric counterpart. a recent study by He et al. showed that multiple antibodies opsonized to the infected cell surface enhance the clustering and cross-linking of FcRs to activate effector cells. studies by pal et al. used combinations of antibodies against chikungunya virus (CHIKV) to limit viral resistance and to provide in vivo protection against CHIKV infection. some of these modifications include the GASDALIE (G236A/S239D/A330L/I332E) mutation to increase FcR binding. the presence of fucose decreases the affinity of the Fc domain for FcRIIIa and thereby reduces efficiency of ADCC [118,119]. a terminal galactose has been shown to increase ADCC, CDC and ADCP [123,124,125]. antibody glycoengineering has been exploited to improve efficacy of bNAb\u2013FcR interactions against HIV-1-infected cells. similar modifications were carried out for the bNAbs VRC01 and PG9. a non-fucosylated and non-galactosylated glycovariant of the Palivizumab mAb against RSV showed improved in vivo protective capacity by decreasing viral titers. the conformation of Env being recognized by any given antibody, its rate of internalization, the affinity of the antibodies for different FcRs, Fc receptor polymorphism, the modulation of stress ligands by the virus, and the presence or not of soluble forms of Env are just a few examples."}
