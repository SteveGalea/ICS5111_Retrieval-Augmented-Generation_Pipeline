{"summary": "miRNAs are classes of small, endogenous, noncoding regulatory RNAs that are 22 nucleotides in length. they are widely expressed in eukaryotes and participate in regulation of a variety of functions, including gene expression, developmental timing, organ development, cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell differentiation, fat metabolism, and the biological processes of tumors. miRNAs play an important role in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. but a few reports have investigated the target genes of miR-499. a total of 24 samples were collected from the swine testicular farm. in cells of overexpression miR-499, 150 L Opti-MEM serum-free medium (GIBCO) was mixed with 5 L of LipofectamineTM2000 (Invitrogen) and 1.25 L 20 mol of the miR-499 mimics and negative control. transfected cells were used in further assays or RNA/protein extraction. QKI QKI-RACE-F TAGCGGTGTGTGCGG QKI-RACE-R ATGCGTGTCCATCCTTACCACCACCTCC CYLC1-RACE-F GAGCCTTTACTTCCATCACC F, forward; R, reverse. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with an RT-PCR Kit (Takara) the expression of miR-499 and genes (CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, ZNF313) was detected in twenty-four samples with each other and each sample repeated thrice. the qPCR mixture included cDNA (2 L), PCR-Master Mix (10. qPCR was performed in a reaction under the following procedure: 95\u00b0C for 30 s; 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 30 s. expression of miR-499 and genes was detected using the SYBR Green I (Takara) the expression of miR-499 and QKI gene detection was detected by western blot. animal experiments were done under the guidance of animal care and use committee. swine testicular cells were purchased from a company (Boster) transfection mixture was added to each well containing the cells in Opti-MEM serum-free medium after incubation at room temperature for 30 min. transfected cells were used in further assays or RNA/protein extraction. cDNA was synthesized by reverse transcription with an RT-PCR Kit (Takara) Primers of miR-499 and its target genes were designed for quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction according to sequence of NCBI and miRBase14.0. the expression of miR-499 and genes (CYLC1, DMRT1, QKI, XRN2, ZNF313) was detected in twenty-four samples with each other and each sample repeated thrice. the qPCR mixture included cDNA (2 L), PCR-Master Mix (10 L), PCR-F-Primer (0.5 L), PCR-R-Primer (0.5 L), and RNase-free H2O (7 L). the expression of miR-499 and genes was detected using the SYBR Green I (Takara) and was analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 software. the data were analyzed using the SPSS 13.0 software and 2CT method was used according to the following formula. age of swine was analyzed by a microscope, which was shown in Figure 1. the diameter of seminiferous tubules is advanced with the growth of age of swine. with the increase of age, the interstitial connective tissue gradually reduced, and seminiferous tubule gradually developed into a mature one. CYLC1 gene expression was low in the young testes but began to rapidly increase at 5 months of age. DMRT1 gene expression levels displayed an overall downward trend. by 5\u20137 months, its expression in the testicular tissue was slightly increased. expression of miR-499 was higher expressed in 1-day-old testes than in 1\u20134 month testes. expression increased at 5\u20137 months of age in swine testes. results of western blotting analysis consistent with qPCR results. miR-499 inhibited the expression of QKI gene in swine testicular cells. expression of miR-499 in overexpressing miR-499 group was significantly higher than in the normal cells group and negative control group. expression of miR-499 and QKI gene in the normal cells group and negative control group had no significant difference expression. the diameter of seminiferous tubules is advanced with age of swine. with the increase of age, the interstitial connective tissue gradually reduced. seminiferous tubule gradually developed into a mature one. spermatogenic cells and sertoli cells gradually moved closer to the basement section of seminiferous tubules. mRNA and protein of miR-499 and its target genes were detected. but only the protein of gene QKI that had a negative correlation with miR-499 in mRNA level was detected. the highest expression levels were detected at 7 months of age. expression of miR-499 had significant negative correlation with QKI gene. expression of QKI gene was higher expressed in 1-day-old testes than in 1\u20134 month testes. expression increased at 5\u20137 months of age in swine testes. of miR-499 existed on 3\u2032UTR of QKI gene. in this figure, luciferase reporter vectors were constructed. in the fused area, the primer has a complementary area for the DNA piece. in the fused area, the primer has a complementary area for the DNA piece. miRNA-143 and miR-223 levels were significantly lower in the morbidly obese group and obese group than the control group (normal BMI or overweight) studies have shown that miRNAs may be involved in the regulation of mitosis and gene expression during spermatogenesis. of these, 14 miRNAs were unregulated and five miRNAs were downregulated in the immature mouse testis. the highest expression of miR-499 was detected in 2 month-old swine testis. by 7 months of age, these tubules reached maximum size. the expression of its target gene QKI was the lowest at 2 month."}
