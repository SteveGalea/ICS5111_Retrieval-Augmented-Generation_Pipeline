{"summary": "a fundamental concern regarding RNA viruses is their high mutation rate [2,5]. RNA viruses exist as quasispecies which are the result of pressure, mutation, and selection, in ways poorly understood. the chance that defined molecules may promote selection of escape mutants or a particular detection tool may fail to detect the virus is high. the RNA Q coliphage display peptide library has been developed. peptide library was selected against the SD6 mAbs of the foot-and-mouth disease virus. the membrane-proximal external region (MPER) of the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1) was engineered on the surface of Q as well. the existence of a clear linkage between genotype and phenotype makes it easier for in vitro study. RNA virus replication, particularly RNA phage, was found to be the perfect model system for evolutionary investigation. errors were found to be the result of enzymatic machinery that lacks proofreading repair activities during replication. the genetic variation rate during replication is the conceptual point (pivotal) of the novel technology. the fact that RNA populations continuously vary during replication make them more adaptive than their DNA counterpart and/or organisms. adaptation potential of RNA viruses (RNA phages in particular) can be exploited for in vitro evolutionary biotechnology. merase of the RNA viruses (e.g., the replicase of Q) lack proofreading activity. phages possess very attractive features including high mutation rates, high population and short replication time. each infectious Q virion is about 25 nm in diameter. stop codon triplet (about 400 nucleotides from the initiation) is suppressed by a low level of ribosome misincorporation of tryptophan. the development and achievement of this Q display system was based on some features and known functions of the genome and proteins of the phage described here. cloned complete and partial (mutated and non-mutated) Q sequences. the entire A2 protein must be synthesized to mediate cell lysis. pIII is a characteristic held by the same minor coat protein. a minus strand is produced which acts as a template for the plus strand. this occurs due to a small relaxation state of the template before its folding into a secondary structure, closing the region. a portion of the -helical domain is involved in genomic RNA binding. the minor coat protein A1 protein has a 15-residue-long polyproline type II helix PPII. the read-through domain of Q A1 protein has a 15-residue-long polyproline type II helix PPII. the replicase is a holoenzyme consisting of four subunits. the subunit (65 kDa) is encoded by the phage itself. the ribosomal protein (S1, 70 kDa) is part of the bacterial 70S ribosome. elongation factor subunit is a translation elongation factor that binds to aminoacylated tRNAs (aatRNA) it assists them in moving into the correct position within the ribosome in the A-site via the formation of a ternary complex that consists of EF-Tu:GTP:aatRNA. HF1 is a 102 amino acid protein provided by the hfq gene. the rate of replication depends on the ratio of HF1 to RNA rather than on the ratio of RNA to replicase. replicase is capable of amplifying its genome 10,000-fold within one hour. polymerization occurs once the 3\u2032 bound end of the template RNA enters into the initiation site of the replicase. the mechanism for plus strand is that it is replicated in equal amounts along with the minus strand so long as HF1 is supplied in excess. replication for that event is terminated and the strand joins a minus strand. coat protein RNA is accessible to the ribosome. binding of the ribosome to the start of the coat RNA region frees the replicase start gene region. the subunit of the replicase requires a few more proteins from the host bacterium. this competition results in a repression of translation due to ribosome removal. the genome of Q is encapsulated by capsomers that make up the icosahedral structure. a five-stranded -sheet core, a hairpin and two helices on the outside of the particle make up the coat protein. the Q virion contains only one copy of the 48.55 kDa maturation protein A2. cloned complete and partial (mutated and non-mutated) Q sequences. phage production increased 100-fold over cells with the full Q genome plasmid only. partial synthesis did not lead to cell lysis. a portion of the -helical domain is involved in genomic RNA binding. a variant of phages solution is loaded to the well of a plate pre-coated with the desired target (bio or abio) the indicator bacteria (Escherichia coli Q13) at the log phase growth are added to the well. the read-through domain of Q A1 protein has a 15-residue-long polyproline type II helix PPII. it suggests its relevance and complete functionality as these PPII motifs foster protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013nucleic acid interactions. the ribosomal protein (S1, 70 kDa) is encoded by the phage itself. the -subunit consists of a finger, thumb, and palm domain. elongation factor subunit is a translation elongation factor that binds to amino. elongation factor subunit is a second elongation factor in E. coli that allows EF-Tu to hydrolyze GTP into GDP. it then releases bound GDP where it can be recycled and allows for EF-Tu to bind a new GTP to catalyze another aatRNA. kDA replicase holoenzyme is completely assembled after hijacking the host\u2019s ribosomal protein as well as the EF-Tu and EF-Ts elongation factors. both the plus and minus strands will serve as templates during replication rather than just the minus strands. the replicase is capable of amplifying its genome 10,000-fold within one hour. the Q phages infect bacteria with the F-pili, making them male dependent viruses. to start the infection during the lifecycle the phages adsorb to the specific bacterial sex pili proteins of a sensitive host cell. the minus strand of the RNA genome is the first product of this replication that serves as the template for the synthesis of the plus strand. the temporary availability of the A2 start gene to the ribosome would produce a small amount of A2 proteins. Q\u2019s replicase can use both the template and the product strands as templates during each round of amplification. the replicase does not require high temperature for denaturation as do traditional PCR enzymes such as Thermus aquaticus DNA polymerase (Taq) the entire process can occur at 37 \u00b0C. have successfully constructed and exposed a 5-mer library of FMDV VP1 G-H loop on the external surface of Q. the tandem amino acid sequence required for anti-FMDV monoclonal antibody SD6 was selected and evolved with our novel panning system. the size of the inserted library and the stability of the phages obtained were the major issues. hybrid phages could be used to assess the antigenicity of specific peptides in an infected subject. nanotags can be used as part of the peptide library for easy identification and tracking to establish binding of recombinant phage to the right antibody. this is a big breakthrough to the future of therapeutic tools against cancer using Q phage and nanobodies. RNA phage display system avoids biohazards seen during live virus laboratory manipulations. RNA viruses\u2019 replication, mutation, resistance to antiviral therapy, Red Queen Hypothesis, and escaping immune molecules can be alleviated in the coming century."}
