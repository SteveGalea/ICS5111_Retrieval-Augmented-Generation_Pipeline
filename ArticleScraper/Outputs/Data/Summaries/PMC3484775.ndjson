{"summary": "a survey on the causes of death revealed that more than half of all deaths were caused by infectious diseases. major health problems in china before 1949 are noteworthy for the virtual absence of non-communicable diseases. over 512 million of china's 600 million people were vaccinated against smallpox between 1950 and 1952. the last outbreak of smallpox in China occurred in 1960, 20 years before global eradication (7). cases of typhus dropped by 95% in the 1950s. there were also major attempts to control gonorrhoea and syphilis. prostitution was also outlawed and the status of women elevated. EPSs grew in number, reaching around 2500 by 1965 (7). in 1966, mao launched the Cultural Revolution, throwing china into a ten-year period of political and economic chaos. the revolution was characterized by mass mobilization of urban youth against authority, closure of higher education institutions and a \u201creturn to the countryside\u201d policy. many barefoot doctors were selected from, functioned in the context of and were largely funded by local production brigades (roughly 1000-2000 people in a geographic area) other barefoot doctors were selected from among the urban youths who were ill-equipped to farm but educated and literate enough to be trained in basic health care. the barefoot doctors continued the \u201cprevention first\u201d approach to CDC established in the 1950s under the guidance of the Patriotic Health Campaign Coordination Office. clinical links were established via a three-tier referral network from village through commune to county levels, with supervision in the reverse direction. barefoot doctors continued the \u201cserve the people\u201d philosophy of the patriotic campaigns initiated in the late 1960s. the ideology of self-sufficiency, gender equality and egalitarianism was taken up by the Mao and the Communists in Yan\u2019an in the 1940s. the political situation in the mid-1960s gave rise to Mao\u2019s contention that the urban elite was ignoring the backbone of the Revolution. the benefit for the nation as whole through collectivization at this lower level was the result of reliable supply of grain for the cities. the barefoot doctors program provided the barefoot doctors program with a significant source of labour, also contributing to effective MCH programs (6). the outcome of the PRC\u2019s efforts in CDC and community-funded public health during its first 30 years are remarkable indeed. by 1957, more than two-thirds of china\u2019s then 2050 counties had an epidemic prevention station (EPS) or more specialized centres for the control of specific diseases (such as malaria, plague, schistosomiasis, leishmaniasis and brucellosis) modelled on those established in the Soviet Union earlier in the 20th century. each of these short-term interventions (on average twice a year, lasting for around a week) required the mass mobilization of peas patriotic health campaigns occurred in the context of major political instability in china. EPSs grew in number, reaching around 2500 by 1965 (7) and vertical CDC programs expanded. china's barefoot doctors rose in number from around one million in 1970 to 1.8 million in 1977. many barefoot doctors were selected from, functioned in the context of and were largely funded by local production brigades. the quality of health care provided by the barefoot doctors varied widely. rural government and health system in 1960s\u20131970s china. roles of barefoot doctors and health aides included environmental sanitation, health education, disease screening, surveillance and control. CDC continued to benefit from management of water sources and disposal of human excreta (including through composting) barefoot doctors were introduced at the more stable village or brigade level, represented in the health sector by the barefoot doctors and the CMS. one thesis holds that they were part of Mao\u2019s goal of improving the level of literacy in China, itself the antithesis of the contemporary philosophy that education was bourgeois (17). the barefoot doctor movement was the surfeit of labour generated by the burgeoning population. restrictions kept the rural population above 80% of the total until 1979. the focus on gender equity was another significant influence on the success of the barefoot doctor movement. from 1979 to 1984, CMS coverage fell from 80%-90% of peasants to 40%-45%. the number of the newly-named \u201cvillage doctors\u201d fell to around 1.2 million by 1984. their supervision and regular retraining also decreased dramatically. ive health services declined and the government adopted a laissez-faire attitude to preventive health (19,33) the public health share of the health budget declined from 15-18% in the 1970s to 10.6% by 1995. control of schistosomiasis, TB, leprosy and also MCH reduced their uptake. but the government introduced an immunization insurance scheme to counter falling coverage. fees for routine vaccination were only officially banned in 2007. the sale of optional vaccines remains a significant source of income for CDCs in china. figure 3 depicts the disease reporting system that applied from 1985 to 2003. the system was characterized by poor enforcement and weak oversight. the system was characterized by poor enforcement and weak oversight. in the 1950s hundreds of millions in 12 southern provinces were at risk of this disease. around 2% of china\u2019s population was infected (45,46) schistosomiasis persists in seven provinces. TB is probably the most important communicable disease that China has struggled to control. 45% of the population are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. cases number around 1.5 million per year, and deaths around 160 000. the nature of TB as a disease affecting the poor applies in china as elsewhere. the problem of multi-drug resistance, currently around 8% of cases, is rising. overall TB control in china was another example where CDC suffered due to lack of public funding in poor areas. economic approaches helped to \u201celiminate\u201d STDs from China by 1964 (10,56) there were massive increases in STD incidence and an emerging HIV problem in the 1990s (57) there were massive increases in STD incidence and an emerging HIV problem in China in the 1990s (57), and problems that have led to difficulties in sustaining control of TB and schistosomiasis have plagued STD control. the government has again massively increased funding for education, screening and treatment of STDs, including HIV (60) the long term success of these measures will again depend on the level of uptake of these activities, fair access to care and local government support. the success of these measures indicates the level of associated political support, but as explained above, this was not always a given. china has the world\u2019s second highest number of cases of TB (after India) 45% of the population are infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis, with rates of infection and active disease much higher in rural and western areas. around 1.5 million cases per year, and deaths around 160 000. the nature of TB as a disease affecting the poor applies in china as elsewhere. absolute case numbers have increased with the population and the problem of multi-drug resistance, currently around 8% of cases, is rising. TB control was another example where CDC suffered due to lack of public funding in poor areas. syphilis and gonorrhoea made mass screening and drug treatment relatively easy. this combination was inseparable from the revolutionary milieu of the time. despite very high rates of infection during the early years of the People\u2019s Republic, helped to \u201celiminate\u201d STDs from China by 1964 (10,56) there were massive increases in STD incidence and an emerging HIV problem in the 1990s. the government has again massively increased funding for education, screening and treatment of STDs, including HIV (60) but the long term success of these measures will again depend on the level of uptake of these activities, fair access to care and local government support. despite improvements in nutrition, socio-economic status and health infrastructure, there was little progress in infectious disease rates and suggestions that some were increasing slightly during this period (30) ly increased its support for CDC (physical infrastructure, staffing and funding) after this shock (39) two other major CDC-related impacts of SARS in china were undertaken. first was the revision of the Law on Infectious Diseases in august 2004 mandating the reporting of 37 notifiable conditions. a new electronic notifiable disease reporting system was introduced in 2004. hospitals and 83.8% of township/village-level facilities, up from 66% in 2007. delay in reporting and entering a notifiable disease report is reported to have dropped from 5 and 3.5 days to less than one day. impact of these two initiatives is evident in the rise in notifiable disease reports since 2003 (39). public education campaigns and research to reduce the risk of emerging threats such as recrudescence of dengue fever. increases in brucellosis, zoonoses and the impact of annual outbreaks of influenza and EV71 infection have also supported large scale CDC activities in China in recent years. despite improvements in disease surveillance and CDC since SARS, a remarkably similar and concerning reluctance to report disease outbreaks in times of political sensitivity persists. the ongoing tendency of those in power in China to put nationalism and politics ahead of public health at certain key times suggests a continuing risk for CDC (71). CDC in china has not used imported vaccines in its EPI. it is safe to assume that those who would benefit most do not receive them. TB is not the only bacterium for which antibiotic resistance is a major emerging problem in china."}
