{"summary": "teratogenic effects resulting in microcephaly in newborn infants is the greatest public health threat. in 2016, the Zika virus epidemic was declared as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) mathematical models were constructed to explicitly elucidate related transmission dynamics. simple and complex models should be exploited differently. complex models can be produced in a timely fashion. complex models integrating real-world data require more time to develop. the first large outbreaks occurred on Yap Island, Federated States of Micronesia, in 2007. it was estimated that up to 73% of the Yap Island residents were asymptomatically infected. this outbreak was the largest recorded at the time. in the twenty-first century many emerging and reemerging infectious diseases threaten the human race. the epidemics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the H1N1 influenza pandemic of 2009 are excellent evidence. the modern era of infectious disease modeling was initiated a century ago with a mosquito-borne model proposed by Sir Ronald Ross. Ross developed a set of mathematical equations to illustrate how malaria parasites were transmitted between mosquitoes and humans. the model was later complemented by the work of Macdonald (MacDonald, 1952), and finally became the well-known Ross-Macdonald models. in our publication survey, we used the search terms \u201cdynamics,\u201d \u201cmathematical model,\u201d \u201cmodeling\u201d and \u201cvector-borne\u201d together with the names of vector-borne diseases including chikungunya, dengue, malaria, west Nile, and Zika. in the second step, we examined only the models applied to zika virus simulations. d S d t = S I N, d I d t = S I N I, and d R d t = I. the force of infection in this case is defined as IN, where N is the total population. the colors represent epidemiological status: susceptible (S, blue), exposed (E, gray), infectious (I, red), and recovered (R, green). both host and vector individuals are assumed to be well-mixed and are classified only according to their epidemiological status. the approximate R0 for measles, mumps, and polio is 16, 12, and 5, respectively. during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola virus outbreaks, the R0 values were 1.71 for Guinea, 1.83 for liberia, and 2.02 for Sierra Leone. d t = H I H, (2) Mosquitoes d S M d t = M M M M M M M M, d E M d t = M M M M M M M M M, and d I M d t = M M M M M M M M M M, respectively. the parameters, and represent the force of infection, incubation rate, birth rate, and death rate, respectively. 0 = 1 H M M + M 1 M H N H = a 2 p M p H m M M + M. the value of R0 that includes a complete cycle of transmission is the square of the value calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. however, they agree on the invasion threshold. spatial cluster causes closer places to become more vulnerable. the transmission kernel is defined as the probability distribution of distances between the infectious premise and other related places. spatial epidemic models have been applied to vector-borne diseases. a weighted ensemble model and a spatially explicit model were constructed to explain the spatial diffusion of the virus under different circumstances. for Zika, spatially dependent differential equations were employed to describe the 2015\u20132016 Zika outbreak in Rio de Janeiro Municipality in Brazil. a location-specific projection was also performed to estimate the magnitude of Zika virus infections in childbearing women on the American continent. the force of infection, i, incorporates transmission from both the infectious individuals within patch i and the infectious individuals from patch j. the exact formula of i depends on the assumed mechanism of transmission and the strength of the interaction between the patches. a metapopulation-typed model was constructed to investigate the effects of sexual transmission and human migration in the spread of the virus. it was estimated that the first introduction of the virus to Brazil may have occurred between August 2013 and April 2014. contact network modeling has often been used to investigate disease transmission in humans and animals. a radio-based wearable device was used to identify high-resolution close proximity interactions (less than 1.5 m) among 75 individuals dwelling in 5 different households in rural Kenya. a bipartite network, whose nodes are divided into two separate groups with a scale-free degree distribution, was also used to simulate vector-borne disease transmission. a previous study used a contact-tracing investigation to identify possible contact-site clusters. individual-based model The agent-based model allows us to mimic the complexity of individual interactions. each individual can be explicitly simulated with a set of characteristics including spatial location, interaction preference, behavior traits, etc. a graphical presentation of the basic models described in this review is illustrated in Fig. 1.

(2016) 2015\u20132016 Brazil Human (SI) spatial models were developed to demonstrate how the Zika virus moves across geographical spaces. the maps generated from spatial modeling were the most comprehensible tools for the general public compared to other model outputs. the early metapopulation, network, and individual-based models were mostly structured without geographical or timeframe references. it seemed difficult to immediately fit the real-world data into these sophisticated frameworks. not long after the Zika epidemic started in Brazil, a data-driven metapopulation model was presented. import risk models are necessary to predict the probability of Zika importation into other unaffected countries. model was previously employed to estimate the risk of Ebola virus importation into the top 20 destinations of travelers departing from the three Ebola epidemic countries in West Africa. risk of importing the Ebola virus during the peak of the epidemics could have reached 0.73 in Ghana, where the highest number of air passengers were observed. this method was previously used in the import risk assessment for dengue virus diffusion from Brazil to other countries during the 2016 summer games. a previous study exploited the prior knowledge of rubella control to construct a Zika virus simulation. an intervention model for a related emerging disease could be well supported in a timely fashion using such solid mathematical environments. a previous study used a modeling approach to assess the requirement of healthcare resources in real-time. the authors claimed that their model could provide an accurate prediction. but the field data accuracy and baseline simulations directly affect the prediction power of strategic models. the future of infectious disease modeling including vector-borne diseases may alter the classical methods. multiple modeling outputs may be generated automatically right after raw data are entered into computers. in epidemiology, big data are increasingly being used to estimate disease spread and investigate effectiveness of interventions. the GLEAM framework provides a user-friendly and easy-to-read graphical tool for general modelers and public health agencies. the results presented by Zhang et al. were delivered via user-friendly and easy-to-read graphics on a web application. d t = S I N, d I d t = S I N I, and d R d t = I. the force of infection is defined as IN, where N is the total population. in this case, it is assumed that the dynamics of disease transmission are much faster than the dynamics of demographic processes. individuals are assumed to be well-mixed and are classified only according to their epidemiological status. the subscripts H and M denote human and mosquito, respectively. both host and vector individuals are assumed to be well-mixed. the approximate R0 for measles, mumps, and polio is 16, 12, and 5, respectively. during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola virus outbreaks, the R0 values were 1.71 for Guinea, 1.83 for liberia, and 2.02 for Sierra Leone. the subscripts H and M represent the force of infection, incubation rate, birth rate, and death rate respectively. the parameters, and represent the force of infection, incubation rate, birth rate, and death rate respectively. the value of R0 that includes a complete cycle of transmission is the square of the value calculated using the next-generation matrix approach. for zika, the R0 for the dengue virus in Brazil ranged from 2\u2013103 in different epidemics in the country from 1996\u20132003. spatial cluster causes closer places to become more vulnerable. the transmission kernel is defined as the probability distribution of distances between the infectious premise and other related places. for zika, spatially dependent differential equations were employed to describe the 2015\u20132016 Zika outbreak in Rio de Janeiro Municipality in Brazil. a location-specific projection was also performed to estimate the magnitude of Zika virus infections in childbearing women on the American continent. metapopulation assumes that the whole population is divided into different discrete spatial subgroups called \u201cpatches\u201d. the force of infection, i, incorporates transmission from both the infectious individuals within patch i and the infectious individuals from patch j. the exact formula of i depends on the assumed mechanism of transmission and the strength of the interaction between the patches. a metapopulation-typed model was constructed to investigate the effects of sexual transmission and human migration in the spread of the virus in the Americas. it was estimated that the first introduction of the virus to Brazil may have occurred between August 2013 and April 2014. interaction is divided into directed and undirected. directed links dictate incoming and outgoing edges. undirected approach does not consider directions, such as co-author networks. a bipartite network, whose nodes are divided into two separate groups with a scale-free degree distribution, was also used to simulate vector-borne disease transmission. a previous study used a contact-tracing investigation to identify possible contact-site clusters. agent-based model allows us to mimic the complexity of individual interactions. each individual can be explicitly simulated with a set of characteristics. these state variables dictate how individuals interact with each other. but they can change over time. a graphical presentation of the basic models described in this review is illustrated in Fig. 1. Mathematical modeling for Zika virus epidemics The virus has been in the sights of modelers for just a decade following a series of outbreaks on Yap Island. the crisscross transmission between humans and mosquitoes has been popularly simulated. the crisscross transmission between humans and mosquitoes has been popularly simulated. a model focusing only on human compartments was recently proposed. the most prominent advantage of the spatial models is their visualizing power. the maps generated from spatial modeling were the most comprehensible tools for the general public. the early metapopulation, network, and individual-based models were mostly structured without geographical or timeframe references. it seemed difficult to immediately fit the real-world data into these sophisticated frameworks. not long after the Zika epidemic started in Brazil, a data-driven metapopulation model incorporating large-scale real-world data was presented. import risk models are necessary to predict the probability of Zika importation into other unaffected countries. model was previously employed to estimate the risk of Ebola virus importation into the top 20 destination countries of travelers departing from the three Ebola epidemic countries in West Africa. risk of importing the Ebola virus during the peak of the epidemics could have reached 0.73 in Ghana, where the highest number of air passengers were observed. the risk was estimated from a Gaussian function t = C 1 exp t C 2 2 C 3 F t. the results suggest that 584\u20131,786 Zika cases may have been exported from Brazil during the 2014\u20132015 epidemics. the risk was estimated using binomial distribution Rn,e,t = Binom(Tn,e,t In,e,t), where Rn,e,t represents the risk of viral importation into country n from affected country e at time t. model scenario indicated that the number of asymptomatic dengue cases among tourists may have reached 206 during the study period. simulated outbreak scenario was examined for the performance of control measures against highly pathogenic avian influenza in Ontario, Canada. intervention models were also constructed for Zika. the research team created a user-friendly online tool that was flexible enough to include new parameters. the program facilitated the financial allocation and assessed its effectiveness. an economic model was built to assess the implementation costs and to suggest alternatives to reduce them. the study made it possible to produce a more realistic output reflecting the actual outbreak situations. large-scale health-related data shared among health professionals are undoubtedly beneficial for the unprecedented development of healthcare services. epidemic models can be used either as predictive tools or as a means of understanding fundamental epidemiological processes. however, prediction is perhaps the most obvious use of epidemic models. the model complexity itself may hamper the use of models by nonspecialists and public health practitioners. simple and complex models can be produced in a timely fashion. complex models require more time to develop but are far more realistic. authors declare there are no competing interests."}
