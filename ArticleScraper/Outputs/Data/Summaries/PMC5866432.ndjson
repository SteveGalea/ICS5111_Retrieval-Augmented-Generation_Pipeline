{"summary": "inflammation is a common consequence of exposure to pathogen-associated molecular patterns such as endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) pneumonias, sepsis, aspiration, and trauma may all cause lung inflammation, but the common instigating events remain unclear. pulmonary ACE2 function is thought to play an important role in the respiratory disease associated with acid aspiration, sepsis, and severe infections. loss of ACE2 catalytic function in association with infection or injury perturbs the pulmonary RAS (11), increasing inflammation and vascular permeability because of activation of the ANG II/angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) axis. other biological substrates of pulmonary ACE2 and their contributions to inflammation are largely unknown reagent-grade chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO) primary airway epithelial cells were isolated from trachea or bronchi from human donors and cultured at the air-liquid interface on collagen-coated polycarbonate filters. human and mouse RPLO forward primers were used to detect respective mRNA levels. mouse lungs were removed, and wet weights were measured. a portion of the lung was subjected to wet weight-to-dry weight ratio measurement. cyanin 3 (Cy3)-labeled mouse anti-tubulin IV monoclonal antibody was applied for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed with PBS three times and mounted with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. immunofluorescent staining of lung tissues was performed on 4% paraformaldehyde-fixed sections. a commercially available pAP1-TA-Luc plasmid was used for transfection. it was used as a template for generating recombinant adenovirus vector. the fragment containing the firefly luciferase (9) gene was released by XhoI and NotI double digestion. ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 300 mM NaCl, 10 nM ZnCl2 and 0.01% Brij 35, pH 6.5 were incubated with ACE2 substrate. the fluorescence intensity was determined using a multiplate fluorescence reader at excitation wavelength of 330 nm and emission wavelength of 400 nm. both ACE2/ and BKB1R/ mouse lines are on C57BL/6 background. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine-xylazine. mice were then administered 50 g of LPS (Escherichia coli 055: B5; Sigma) BALF were determined by bicinchoninic acid assay (no. 23225; Pierce); murine CXCL5, C-X-C motif chemokine 1 (KC), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP2), and TNF- abundances were assessed by ELISA (R&D Systems). reagent-grade chemicals were obtained from Sigma Chemical (St. Louis, MO) all preparations used were well differentiated (>4 wk old; resistance >1,000 cm2) to stimulate cells in vitro with endotoxin, lipooligosaccharide complexed with MD-2 protein was applied to the apical surface of airway epithelia as reported previously (34). a portion of the lung was subjected to wet weight-to-dry weight ratio measurement. the wet weight-to-dry weight ratio was calculated to evaluate lung edema. cells were washed with PBS and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 5 min. the sections were warmed to 56\u00b0C in a vacuum incubator (Isotemp Vacuum Oven, Fisher Scientific) then washed twice in xylene, redehydrated in ethanol (100, 95, and 70% and water) then processed for antigen retrieval in citrate buffer (10 mM, pH 6.0) and microwave (1,000 W, 6 min) samples were then washed with PBS, blocked with 1% BSA-5% donkey serum (1 h, room temperature), then the activator protein-1 enhancer was released by XhoI and NotI double digestion. it was inserted into a promoterless adenoviral shuttle plasmid (pAd5mcspA) adenovirus was generated by homologous recombination as previously described (52) and stored in 10 mM Tris with 20% glycerol at 80\u00b0C. the fluorescence intensity was determined using a multiplate fluorescence reader at excitation wavelength of 330 nm and emission wavelength of 400 nm. ELISA for Mouse ACE2 Protein Quantification Sandwich ELISA analysis was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. lavage was performed with 0.5-ml volumes of sterile saline (total lavage volume, 4 ml/mouse) the recovered volumes of each BALF sample were recorded to normalize protein concentration in BALF. the cells were counted and spun onto a glass slide. RESULTS des-Arg9 Bradykinin Is an ACE2 Substrate in airway epithelia DABK was shown to be a substrate of ACE2 in a biochemical assay. no evidence has confirmed that it is a biological substrate of ACE2 in the lung. to test this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of DABK on the activity of human BKB1R. des-Arg9 bradykinin (DABK) is a substrate of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in human airway epithelia. HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing activator protein-1 (AP-1) luciferase and human BKB1R (B1), with or without a human ACE2 (hACE2) construct. apically applied DABK caused little change in AP-1 luciferase activity. ACE2 derived from airway epithelia inactivates AP-1 luciferase activity. oxin, Coincident with Neutrophil Infiltration We selected LPS inhalation to further investigate ACE2 biology and its possible role in mediating inflammation. mice received 50 g LPS at time 0, and the catalytic activity of ACE2 was measured at the times indicated in the presence and absence of DX600. this coincided with a decline in ACE2 catalytic activity, reaching a nadir at the 6-h time point (Fig. 2A). endotoxin does not attenuate ACE2 activity per se, indicating an endotoxin-mediated regulation of ACE2 activity in the lung. we measured catalytic activity of 10 ng recombinant human ACE2 with or without coincubating with 10 g LPS at 37\u00b0C for 60 min. to explore whether endotoxin could affect ACE2 abundance and thus impact ACE2 activity at the transcriptional level. endotoxin induces reduction of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein abundance in the lung. enzymatic activity of recombinant human ACE2 (rhACE2) protein alone (10 ng) or coincubated with 10 g endotoxin at 37\u00b0C for 60 min was measured by fluorometric-based substrate assay. the rapid neutrophil infiltration is in parallel with reduced ACE2 abundance in the lung. the results suggest that lacking active ACE2 in the lung facilitates neutrophil infiltration induced by LPS exposure. however, the more rapid neutrophil influx due to lack of active ACE2 in the lung has its consequences. at 3 h post-LPS inhalation and the strengthened IKK/phosphorylation was faded at 6 h post-LPS inhalation. lack of pulmonary angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity promotes neutrophil infiltration of the lung and exacerbates LPS-induced lung inflammation and injury. comparison is conducted as indicated in B\u2013D and between the LPS-alone group and the LPS-plus-ACE2 inhibitor DX600 group (F\u2013I) the results in Fig. 1 indicated that DABK is a substrate of pulmonary ACE2. expression of BKB1R in air-liquid interface primary airway epithelial cell cultures, controls (CTL) or treated with lipooligosaccharide-myeloid differentiation factor 2 (LOS:MD-2). A: human BKB1R (hBKB1R) mRNA expression as assessed by quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR. in vitro results to an in vivo model of inflammation. we administered the BKB1R antagonist [Leu8]-DABK to mice 15 min before and 3 h after LPS stimulation. this suggests that reduced pulmonary ACE2 activity contributes to the neutrophil infiltration in response to LPS. inhibition of DABK/BKB1R signaling alleviates LPS-induced repression of ACE2 by blocking the NF-B signaling pathway. the beneficial effects of blocking the DABK/BKB1R pathway in LPS-induced lung inflammation and injury are further evidence by lessened lung pathology. inhibition of BKB1R mitigated LPS-induced lung injury as manifested by representative images of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS; I) and cleaved caspase-3 (CC3, red; J) in the lung and proinflammatory cytokine levels in the lung and proinflammatory cytokine levels. chemokine involved in neutrophil recruitment in mouse BALF increased in a time-dependent manner after LPS stimulation and reached its highest levels 6 h post-LPS challenge. this correlates with the time when pulmonary ACE2 activity is at its lowest (Fig. 2A) D: inhibition of ACE2 activity in airway epithelia enhances CXCL5 production in response to des-Arg9 bradykinin (DABK) treatment. n > 6. *P 0.05, **P 0.01, ***P 0.001. activation is a well-established response to BKB1R signaling (4, 58, 59) HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmi. cotransfection of HEK293 cells with AP-1 luciferase and ACE2 significantly blunted the AP-1 luciferase activity induced by DABK. ds expressing activator protein-1 (AP-1) luciferase and human BKB1R (B1) were treated apically with DABK (30 nM) additional interventions included stimulation with DABK alone, DABK application in the presence of airway surface liquid (ASL) collected from air-liquid interface cultures of human airway epithelia. we applied an ACE2-neutralizing antibody to the apical side of the cells for 1 h before DABK stimulation. this intervention significantly enhanced DABK-induced AP-1 luciferase activity. ACE2 derived from airway epithelia inactivates DABK. this coincided with a decline in ACE2 catalytic activity, reaching a nadir at the 6-h time point. endotoxin inhalation reduces pulmonary angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity and induces neutrophil infiltration into the lung. mouse lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid measured for ACE2 enzymatic activity. endotoxin does not reduce ACE2 mRNA abundance. it induces ACE2 gene expression in the lung promptly. endotoxin impairs ACE2 activity in the lung by attenuating ACE2 abundance translationally or posttranslationally. control (CTL) mouse lung or mouse lung exposed to LPS for various times as indicated was collected. total RNA was extracted for qRT-PCR (n 5). ACE2 activity in mouse lungs repressed by LPS inhalation for 6 h was restored by Bay11-7082 (Bay11) lack of active ACE2 in the lung exacerbates LPS-induced lung inflammation. lack of pulmonary angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) activity promotes neutrophil infiltration of the lung and exaggerates subsequent lung inflammation. type mice received the ACE2 inhibitor DX600 (1 mg/kg inhalation) both before and after LPS treatment via nasal instillation. ACE2 contents in mouse lung from the same experimental groups as in B are measured by ELISA. the results in Fig. 1 indicated that DABK is a substrate of pulmonary ACE2. those in Fig. 4 suggested that a reduction in ACE2 function contributes to LPS-induced neutrophil infiltration of the lung. we first assessed BKB1R expression in air-liquid interface cultures of human airway epithelia. BKB1R inhibition reduced neutrophil infiltration 6 h post-LPS challenge. treatment with BKB1R antagonist reduces accelerated neutrophil infiltration 3 h post-LPS challenge in mice pretreated with ACE2 inhibitor DX600. infiltration in the lung 6 h post-LPS inhalation. we pretreated wild-type mice with the BKB1R antagonist [Leu8]-DABK. reduced pulmonary ACE2 activity contributes to neutrophil infiltration. this finding suggests reduced pulmonary ACE2 activity contributes to the neutrophil infiltration in response to LPS. blocking BKB1R partially restored LPS-mediated reduction of angiotensin I-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein content in mouse lung. lane 1, control (CTL; lane 2, mouse lung exposed to LPS for 24 h; lane 3, mouse lung that inhaled BKB1R inhibitor for 24 h; and lane 4, mouse lung treated with BKB1R inhibitor. inflammatory cytokine levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) increased in a time-dependent manner after LPS stimulation. this correlates with the time when pulmonary ACE2 activity is at its lowest. we immunoneutralized CXCL5 levels with an antibody. this decreased neutrophil infiltration in response to LPS. endotoxin enhances airway epithelial chemokine 5 (CXCL5) expression. the first study to demonstrate that DABK is a biological substrate of ACE2 in airway epithelia and that lack of functional ACE2 results in increased neutrophil recruitment to the lung in the setting of LPS challenge. this is the first study to demonstrate that DABK is a well-known pulmonary inflammatory mediator and known ACE2 substrate. ACE2 function in epithelia leads to impaired DABK inactivation. loss of ACE2 function in the lung leads to worsening of acid aspiration or LPS-induced inflammation. but little is known about how inflammatory stimuli affect ACE2 function in the lung. micro-RNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of acute lung injury by targeting the ACE2 gene. no other reports have identified the autoantibodies. ACE2 undergoes shedding and internalization posttranslationally (30, 34) injury in mice preconditioned due to a lack of ACE2 underscores a protective role of active ACE2 in this disease setting. it is not clear why more prompt neutrophil infiltration upon endotoxin exposure is induced by lack of active ACE2 has such a profound impact on lung inflammation. this would create a microenvironment for ACE2 to influence the activity of the DABK/BKB1R axis. ANG II plays a critical role in LPS-induced lung inflammation and injury. this concept has been validated by the identification of a structural network. endotoxin exposure may be a result of inhibition of NF-B signaling by DABK/BKB1R secondary to initial endotoxin stimulation. excessive recruitment to the alveolar compartment in particular has been associated with progressive lung damage. ACE2 is expressed on the apical surface of well-differentiated ciliated epithelia. there it inhibits DABK/bradykinin receptor B1 (BKB1R) activation. ACE2 activity is impaired, leaving the DABK/BKB1R axis more active. a reduction in ACE2 function leads to impaired inactivation of DABK. the resulting activation of the BKB1R signaling cascade enhances the production of neutrophil-recruiting chemokines, such as CXCL5. and H.J. interpreted results of experiments; C.P.S., C.W.-L., and H.J. prepared figures; C.P.S., P.B.M.J., M.C., D.J.H., and H.J. approved final version."}
