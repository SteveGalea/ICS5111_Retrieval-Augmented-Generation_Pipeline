{"summary": "the family is currently divided into 5 genera; Vesivirus, Lagovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus and Nebovirus. a number of other genera have been proposed but have yet to be approved. the most widely studied genera within the Caliciviridae are the norovirus genus as noroviruses are now recognized as the most common cause of viral gastroenteritis. the genomes of caliciviruses share a highly conserved overall structure. typically 7.3\u20137.7 kb in length, polyadenylated at the 3\u2032 end. a shorter than genome length, subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) is also produced during replication, which is 3\u2032 co-terminal to the genomic RNA. the full-length genome is organized into 2\u20134 ORFs. a subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) consisting of ORF2 and ORF3 is also produced during replication. the viral protein, VPg, is covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end of genomic and sgRNAs. eIF3 (Daughenbaugh et al., 2003), eIF4E (Chaudhry et al., 2006) and eIF4G (Chung et al., 2014) calicivirus genomes contain highly conserved RNA secondary structures that play many roles during viral life cycle. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 extremities of calicivirus genomes contain highly conserved RNA secondary structures. the presence of hairpin stem-loop structures at the 3\u2032 end of animal caliciviruses has never been described. the presence of hairpin stem-loop structures at the 3\u2032 end of animal caliciviruses, including RHDV and FCV was also noted in 1994. Fig. 2 illustrates the predicted secondary structures that are found at the 5\u2032 end of a number of representative calicivirus genomes. the stem-loop structures located at the 5\u2032 end of the genome are important for viral replication. mutations that destabilized the stem-loop structures starting at positions 8 and 29 (referred as SL8 and SL29) caused a significant decrease in virus titer. Table 1 summarizes the host factors that interact with the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 extremities of caliciviruses genome. regions Virus Host factors References 5\u2032 MNVa La, PCBP1, PCBP2, hnRNP A1, Nucleolin, DDX3 L\u00f3pez-Manrquez et al. (2013). cellular proteins lupus autoantigen (La), poly(rC)-binding protein (PCBP-2), polypirimidine tract-binding protein (PTB) and heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein L (hnRNPL) were found to be components of an ribonucleoprotein complex formed on the 5\u2032 end of the NV genome. the function of these interactions has yet to be determined. a total of 99 cellular proteins were identified as interacting with the 5\u2032 end of the MNV genomic RNA (ntds 1\u2013250) and 33 cellular proteins interacting with the 3\u2032 end of the MNV genomic RNA (ntds 7141\u20137397). these regions were selected as baits due to the fact that they contain the majority of the RNA structures that are evolutionarily conserved between MNV isolates. recombinant PTB interacts with the 5\u2032 ends of the FCV genomic and sgRNAs, binding to at least two sites at the 5\u2032 end of the genomic RNA. RNAi-mediated reduction in PTB levels resulted in an increase in the translation of replication incompetent VPg-linked FCV RNA but lead to a decrease in overall virus production after infection. a model has been proposed where a gradual recruitment of PTB from the nucleus to the cytoplasmic viral replication complex leads to the repression of viral translation. the net effect is to clear viral RNA of translating ribosomes, contributing to the stimulation of viral RNA replication or enabling the packaging of viral RNA into viral capsids. previous reports have suggested that phosphorylation of key residues within PTB may affect its cellular localization. RNA structures at the 5\u2032 end of the sgRNA of FCV were found to interact directly with PTB. a terminal stem-loop (SL) was predicted to exist in the 3\u2032 UTR of all caliciviruses. bioinformatic approaches have identified extensive regions of RNA secondary structure with the VP2 coding region. a number of deletion mutants were introduced at the VP2 and 3\u2032 UTR. it was found that the 66 bases of 3\u2032 UTR and the last part of the RNA nucleotides encoded ORF3 are important for viral replication in cell culture. the function of this RNA has as yet to be determined. nucleolin binds to the 3\u2032 UTR of tombusvirus RNA. this interaction reduces viral replication during the early stages of replication. nucleolin interacts directly with the nonstructural protein NS5B of hepatitis C virus. the variable p(Y) tract in SL3 is highlighted in gray. the nucleotides at position 7380 are highlighted in black prior to the poly A tail. SL1 is the largest, typically 138 ntds, and is within the VP2 coding region. the single-stranded p(Y) tract in SL3 is present in all MNV isolates. the cellular RNA-binding proteins PTB and PCBP2 interact with the p(Y) tract. however replacement of the p(Y) tract with a GNRA tetraloop (GUAA) or a tetra-A sequence (AAAA) had no effect on viral replication in immortalized murine macrophage cells. a significant body of evidence has shown that the 5\u2032 and the 3\u2032 ends of positive-strand RNA virus genomes interact with each other. these interactions are often mediated by long-range RNA\u2013RNA interaction between the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome. in many cases the 5\u2032\u20133\u2032 end interactions are further stabilized by the associate of host proteins. hnRNP A1 and PCBP2 proteins play crucial role in genome circularization. hnRNP A1 and PCBP2 proteins can replace each other functionally. this can often lead to difficulty in observing their correct functionality in common cell lines. functional characterization of RNA structures and RNA\u2013protein interactions in the life cycle of HuNoV may now be possible. such studies may contribute to the development of novel antiviral strategies for the control of noroviruses."}
