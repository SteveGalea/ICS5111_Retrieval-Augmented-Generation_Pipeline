{"summary": "tetraspanin proteins are ubiquitously expressed and consist of 4 transmembrane domains, an intracellular terminus and 2 extracellular loops. tetraspanins regulate various cellular processes, such as cell adhesion, motility, growth, differentiation, signal transduction, and sperm\u2013egg fusion. et al.

(22) Secretion of cytokines by macrophages Ha e tetraspanin CD9 is a member of the tetraspanin superfamily. it was first identified as the human lymphohematopoietic progenitor cell surface antigen p24 using a monoclonal antibody that bound to acute lymphoblastic leukemia cells. interaction of CD9 with integrin alpha6beta1 seems essential for strong IZUMO1-dependent adhesion of sperm with the oocyte (43). CD9 deficiency reduces the severity of osteoarthritis in aging and antigen-induced arthritis models. the early increase in CD9 expression during megakaryopoiesis suggests that CD9 may play a role in megakaryocytic differentiation by participating in the membrane remodeling process. CD9 regulates hematopoietic stem cells differentiation. CD9 acts as an substitute IL-16 receptor (12) in mast cells, CD9 co-localizes with high-affinity IgE receptor FcRI and non-T-cell activation linker (NTAL) antibody-mediated cross-linking of CD9 activates mast cells, causing degranulation, calcium release and tyrosine phosphorylation of various proteins. CD9 tetraspanin is expressed differentially by monocyte subsets. higher levels on CD14++CD16 subsets than on CD14++CD16+ and CD14+CD16++ monocytes. CD9 expression on monocyte-derived macrophages is stimulated by M-CSF. CD9 regulates myeloid lineages. CD9 activates cells degranulation and cytokines secretion. CD9 regulates inflammation, allowing eosinophils to stimulate CD4+ T-cell activation. expression in CD9-deficient DCs due to an impairment of exocytosis. internalization is blocked, demonstrating that CD9 specifically regulates antigenic presentation in DCs through the regulation of MHC-II intracellular trafficking. ectopic expression of CD9 stimulates the integrin-dependent motility of the Raji B cell line on fibronectin and laminin substrates. ectopic expression of CD9 interferes with B cell differentiation by modulating integrin activity. CD9 regulates lymphoid lineages. this association induces B cell differentiation. CD9 expression also promotes follicular dendritic cell adhesion-inducing survival. CD9+ B cells induce effector T cell growth arrest in sub-G0/G1 and activation of apoptosis via IL-10. authors found that CD9 is expressed on almost all mature T cells and can deliver a potent CD28-independent costimulatory signal. CD9 mutant genes lacking each domain were constructed to determine the role of specific CD9 transmembrane or extracellular domains in ligation with CD5. this study highlights the essential role of particular CD9 transmembrane TM2 and TM3 domains in ligation with CD5. CD9 co-localizes with adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 at the apical endothelial cell surface to promote endothelial\u2013leucocyte adhesion and enhance extravasation and transmigration of leucocytes to the inflammatory site. CD9 negatively regulates HIV-1 Env-induced cell-cell fusion. cell\u2013cell contact between plasmacytoid dendritic cells and hepatitis C virus-infected cells is required for the antiviral immune response. the cell surface molecules CD81 and CD9 but no other hepatitis C virus entry receptors are required to recognize hepatitis C virus-infected cells and induce interferon- (71) in mice infected with cytopathic foot-and-mouth disease viruses, a rapid and specific thymus- CD9 is often downregulated in advanced stages of cancer. it is a sign of poor prognosis in patients with lung, breast, colon, skin, ovary, uterus, stomach, oral cavity, thyroid, prostate, and hematopoietic malignancies. exosomes bear unique protein markers, the main one being CD9. an increase in CD9+ B cells levels between 1 and 24 months after lung transplantation is predictive of long-term survival. in the context of allergic asthma, there are fewer CD9+ B cells in the spleen and lungs of asthmatic mice. CD9 regulates lung inflammation in many diseases and the absence of CD9 is associated with various dysfunctions. panin, CD63, CD9, CD81, and CD82 are present at the viral exit site. CD9 knock-down expression results in an increase of syncytia formation and viral entry. overexpression of CD9 renders cells less susceptible to Env-mediated syncytia formation. the role of CD9 in cancer is quite controversial. the role of CD9 in cancer is quite controversial. the role of CD9 in cancer is often downregulated in advanced stages of cancer. exosomes bear unique protein markers, the main one being CD9 (78). CD9 regulates lung inflammation CD9 functions as a negative regulator of LPS-induced lung inflammation by activating human monocyte\u2013derived macrophage polarization into a regulatory M2 subset (21). in humans, CD9 expression is lower in blood monocytes from patients with COPD than in those from healthy patients. CD9 regulates lung inflammation in many diseases. absence of CD9 is associated with various dysfunctions. many studies now suggest CD9 as a biomarker. CD9 is overexpressed in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma tissues. expression in mesothelioma tissue correlates with survival. xenotransplantation of glioblastoma stem cells into nude rats promotes prolonged survival. tetraspanins, such as CD9, play a role in anti-viral immunity against HIV. higher expression of CD9 among other clusters of differentiation is observed on CD4+ and CD8+ circulating lymphocytes from HIV-infected patients. this enticing strategy could be part of curative strategy for HIV infection. in asthmatic mice, the adoptive transfer of CD9+ B cells normalizes airway inflammation and lung function by inhibiting TH2- and TH17-driven inflammation in an IL-10-dependent manner. this restores a favorable immunological balance in lung tissues (92).
