{"summary": "CCoV is a common infection of dogs, particularly those housed in large groups such as kennels, shelters, and breeding facilities. CCoV is a significant pathogen in veterinary medicine, and is increasingly found to be an important cause of disease. the viral spike protein binds the host cell receptor and triggers fusion of the viral and cellular membranes. RNA recombination is believed to occur during this process of () strand RNA synthesis. strand templates are transcribed to form the (+) strand RNA genomes and (+) strand subgenomic mRNAs. the coronavirus genome, as with all RNA viruses, is highly prone to mutation during replication. respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) is a member of the betacoronavirus genus [13] CCoV is closely related to transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of pigs, ferret coronavirus and feline coronavirus (FCoV) whereas CRCoV is more closely related to bovine coronavirus [14] CCoV-I-like viruses can be sequenced from the feces of young dogs with diarrheal disease. CCoV-I has a unique feature for coronaviruses, the presence of an intact open reading frame (ORF) 3 downstream of the gene encoding the spike protein, which encodes a glycoprotein of unknown function. CCoV-IIa viruses have a NTD consistent with the prototype CCoV. CCoV-IIa biotype is restricted to the small intestine, where it causes enteritis. CCoV-IIb is genetically distinct from CCoV-IIa. CCoV-A76 has been isolated and characterized [29], this serves as a convenient prototype CCoV-IIc. we propose the creation of a new subgroup, CCoV-IIc, which consists of CCoV type II viruses with a CCoV-I- or FCoV-I-like N-terminal domain. these viruses have been reported in both the united states and Sweden [29,30] CCoV-II viruses (such as 1-71) typically grow readily in cell culture. 1-71 also grows well in a variety of feline cell lines (e.g., CRFK) aminopeptidase N (APN) has been shown to act as a common receptor for many alphacoronaviruses, including FCoV and TGEV. this property is unlike most other coronaviruses, which have highly species-specific receptors. this property is unlike most other coronaviruses, which have highly species-specific receptors. coronavirus spike protein is activated by proteolytic cleavage at one or two sites (defined as S1/S2 and S2\u2019) cleavage at the two sites can occur via the action of a wide range of proteases, e.g., trypsin or trypsin-like proteases, cathepsins, elastase, or furin [57]. mutations in the FCoV cleavage site have been linked to a change of cleavability by the protease furin (which cleaves readily at R-R-S/A-R-R-S/A motifs) there is currently no evidence for cleavage site mutations in highly pathogenic CCoV infections. aminopeptidase N (APN) has been shown to act as a common receptor for many alphacoronaviruses, including FCoV and TGEV [42] feline homologue (fAPN) has been shown to act as a common receptor for type II FCoV, type II CCoV and TGEV. this property is unlike most other coronaviruses, which have highly species-specific receptors. coronavirus spike protein is activated by proteolytic cleavage at one or two sites (defined as S1/S2 and S2\u2019) the type I lineage shows the presence of two distinct protease cleavage motifs (R-R-S/A-R-R-S/A at S1/S2 and G/K-R-S at S2\u2019) a multiple sequence alignment summarizing these sites is shown in Figure 3. mutations in the FCoV cleavage site have been linked to a change of cleavability by the protease furin. there is currently no evidence for cleavage site mutations in highly pathogenic CCoV infections. CCoV typically infects and replicates within the cytoplasm of mature epithelial cells along the sides and the tip of intestinal villi, while sparing the epithelium that lines the intestinal crypts. infected villous enterocytes undergo degeneration characterized by shortening, distortion and loss of microvilli of the brush border. the loss of mature villous enterocytes causes atrophy of intestinal villi, which become attenuated in an attempt most consistent clinical sign of pantropic CCoV-IIa is leukopenia [33,34,35] most studies of pantropic CCoV-IIa report presence of viral RNA in various tissues, including lungs, lymph nodes, liver, spleen, kidneys, urinary bladder and brain. genetic markers for pantropic CCoV-IIa\u2019s are currently unknown. coronaviruses have high potential for emergence of novel variants with altered tropism and pathogenesis. increased likelihood of high-density housing for dogs increases viral load of coronavirus in the population. increased co-housing of dogs with other species, particularly cats, also increases the chance of novel recombinant coronaviruses emerging across species. serological tests are of limited use since they cannot currently discriminate between infecting CCoV serotypes or genotypes. serological tests are of limited use since they can only confirm exposure to CCoV and cannot currently discriminate between infecting CCoV serotypes or genotypes."}
