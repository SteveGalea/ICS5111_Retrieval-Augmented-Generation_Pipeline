{"summary": "study was approved by the IACUC of the US Army Institute of Surgical Research (Fort Sam Houston, Houston, TX) animals received humane care in accordance with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals. 5 strains were found to be the most divergent in survival time after hemorrhage in a previous study. rats were anesthetized with 2% to 5% isoflurane (forane, Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL) each catheter was pretreated with tridodecylmethylammonium chloride\u2013heparin. each catheter was passed dorsally beneath the skin, exteriorized in the intrascapular region, filled with 100 L of sterile glycerol. rats were randomly assigned to day of surgery, order of surgery on each day, and order of hemorrhage on each day. at the end of 4 h, surviving rats were euthanized with an intravascular injection of sodium pentobarbital (150 mg/kg) for albumin, blood samples were collected in heparinized syringes and centrifuged at 1900 g for 5 min. the top layer was rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at \u201380 \u00b0C. for study A, arterial blood gases, electrolytes, and metabolites were measured. oxidase\u2013conjugated detection antibody, incubate for 1 h, and wash. add 3,3,5,5-tetramethylbenzidine substrate solution, protect from light. add stop solution and measure absorbance at 450 nm on a plate reader. the lowest 2 standard concentrations had CV of 13% and 10.5%. average slopes of expected compared with measured (b = 1.00) did not differ from 1 (P > 0.05) data were analyzed for homogeneity of variance (Levene test) and for normality of distribution (PROC Univariate Normal with associated Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test) data were transformed where necessary to meet assumptions of ANOVA. a probability level of 0.05 or less was considered significant. the 5 inbred rat strains were Brown Norway (BN), dark agouti (DA), Fawn hooded hypertensive (FHH), Dahl salt-sensitive (SS) and Lewis (LEW) two-way ANOVA with repeated measures indicated no interstrain differences. one-way ANOVA revealed an absence of interstrain differences. percentage decreases were lower for LEW compared with SS rats (P = 0.04) filled bars with different superscripted letters indicate significantly different values. plasma albumin concentrations would have to decrease markedly before significantly less Evans blue would be bound and presumably more rapidly cleared from the blood. a 100-fold increase in the Kd (decrease in affinity) would have to occur before one would measure decrease in the concentration of bound Evans blue. lack of correlation with STAH suggests that plasma albumin concentration may not be a useful predictor of survival ability for these inbred rat strains undergoing conscious controlled hemorrhage. the current study is the first to demonstrate reduction in plasma albumin concentrations in these 5 inbred rat strains. albumin concentrations reflect the net effects of its synthesis, catabolism, leakage from the intravascular space (transcapillary escape) the passage of solutes\u2014such as albumin\u2014out of the vascular space involves primarily 2 transport routes: 1) through the endothelial cells (transcellular) and 2) between the endothelial cells through interendothelial junctions. Evans blue dye is an independent, well-established and validated technique. it has some potential confounding factors, including interference due to lipemia and hemolysis7 and overestimation of blood volume when increased capillary permeability leads to decreased plasma albumin concentrations."}
