{"summary": "humans are thought to be the primary hosts and reservoir of influenza B and C viruses. influenza B virus is a common seasonal human pathogen similar to influenza A virus in its clinical presentation. swine inoculated with influenza C virus transmitted the virus to naive swine by direct contact. genetic and antigenic analysis suggest this virus represents a new subtype of influenza C virus, raising the possibility of reassortment and antigenic shift. RT-PCR or PCR assays to detect porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, porcine coronavirus, and porcine circovirus were also negative. the virus was purified by ultracentrifugation and sequenced on a personal Genome Machine. b Positive value indicates the degree of similarity between proteins. PB1 is reported to be the most conserved influenza virus protein. b Positive value indicates the degree of similarities between proteins. PB1 protein alignments indicated that C/OK was more closely related to influenza C viruses than to influenza A and B viruses but more distant from individual influenza C types. NS1 of C/OK virus had the lowest homology to its counterpart in human influenza C viruses (29%\u201333% identity) the amino acid sequence of the C/OK NP had 38% identity to influenza C viruses. unspliced mRNA from the C/OK M segment 6 encodes the polyprotein P42, which is cleaved by a signal peptidase to yield M1 and CM2. incompatibility between homologous segment packaging sequences has been shown to prevent segment reassortment in nature. significant variability was observed in the NC regions immediately adjacent to each coding region for C/OK. serological survey An HI assay was performed to determine cross-reactivity and seroprevalence of C/OK virus in humans and swine. the assay included reference strains of influenza A, B, and C genera and their matched antisera. for the human cohort, we used a set of 316 serum samples. only 2.8% of the swine sera had measurable titers (range, 10\u201320) results suggest that C/OK virus circulates in swine populations. further serologic studies focusing on individuals occupationally exposed to swine are required. viral replication with titers >104 egg infectious dose 50 from days 4 to 9 were measured with no cytopathic effects. swine intranasally challenged swine intranasally with C/OK. rt-RT-PCR method specifically developed for C/OK virus. three ferrets (donor ferrets) were inoculated intranasally with 106 TCID50 of C/OK virus in 1 ml of sterile PBS. two inoculated ferrets were also housed separately for virus titration. influenza C/Taylor virus failed to replicate at 37\u00b0C in our hands. this virus differs from the C/OK virus that can replicate efficiently at this temperature. these results suggest that C/OK has a broader cellular tropism than C/Taylor. both HE proteins possess an identical catalytic triad: S71/H369/D365 for C/Johannesburg and S73/H375/D372 for C/OK. the other two substrate-interacting residues are completely conserved in the two HE proteins. the influenza C HE protein uses two binding pockets for recognizing the receptor. one binds to the 9-O-acetyl group while the other engages the 5-N-acetyl group [36]. the binding pocket for the 9-O-acetyl group is nearly identical in C/Johannesburg and C/OK. nasal swabs from 15-week old swine exhibiting influenza-like illness were submitted to Newport Laboratories, Worthington, Minnesota, for virus isolation. real-time reverse transcription PCR (rt-RT-PCR) was negative for influenza A virus [16] in swine testicle (ST) cells, the viruses caused influenza-like cytopathic effects (CPE) by day 3. de novo genome assembly found that most of the sequence reads mapped to seven contigs of approximately 1000\u20132400 bp. the virus was purified by ultracentrifugation and sequenced on an Ion Torrent Personal Genome Machine. PB1 is reported to be the most conserved influenza virus protein. PB1 protein alignments indicated that C/OK was more closely related to influenza C viruses than to influenza A and B viruses. hemagglutinin esterase protein is responsible for receptor binding, receptor destroying (acetylesterase) and membrane fusion activities. in influenza A and B viruses, separate hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins perform these functions in a cooperative fashion. NS1 of C/OK virus had the lowest homology to its counterpart in human influenza C viruses (29%\u201333% identity) each RNA segment of influenza viruses also contains noncoding (NC) regions at its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. these regions are highly conserved among the genome segments of each species. incompatibility between homologous segment packaging sequences has been shown to prevent segment reassortment. encoding the C/OK virus PB2, PB1, P3, NP, M and NS clustered most closely with influenza C viruses. this suggests that these genes diverged from known human influenza C viruses after they diverged from influenza A and B viruses. as HE does not occur in influenza A and B viruses, only influenza C viruses were included in that analysis. all but four seras had undetectable HI titers (10) three had HI titers of 20, but each had high titers (160, 320, and 1280) to the human influenza C isolate. the low titers and number of positive samples (1.3%) obtained are inconclusive in determining circulation of C/OK in the human population. virus was first detected in ferrets exposed by direct contact to inoculated ferrets on day 3. a mean titer of 3.9 log10 TCID50/mL was observed in the nasal turbinates. no clinical signs of disease were observed in ferrets exposed to respiratory droplets. swine exposed by direct contact on days 7 and 9 after exposure. no clinical signs of illness were observed. sera collected on day 14 p.i. was positive for antibodies to C/OK virus. cellular tropism We compared in vitro cellular tropism between C/OK and human influenza C viruses by rt-RT-PCR. adenocarcinomic human alveolar basal epithelial (A549), Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK), human rectal tumor (HRT-18G), baby hamster kidney (BHK-21) and porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. lneuraminic acid (Neu5,9Ac2) is the primary receptor for attachment to the cell surface to initiate infection. the virus encodes a sialate-O-acetylesterase, not neuraminidase, in order to release virions from infected cells by cleavage of the 9-O-acetyl group. the overall 53% sequence identity between the two HE proteins allows us to predict important structural features such as the receptor-binding the conserved enzymatic site between C/Johannesburg and C/OK suggests that C/OK utilizes 9-O-acetyl sialic acid as the cellular receptor for infection. analysis of the receptor-binding pocket formed by a cluster of noncontiguous amino acid residues revealed some interesting similarities and differences. the binding pocket for the 9-O-acetyl group is nearly identical in C/Johannesburg and C/OK. the binding pocket for the 9-O-acetyl group is nearly identical in C/Johannesburg and C/OK, implying the utility of the 9-O-acetyl-neuraminic acid for C/OK virus infection. four additional swab samples from swine showed influenza-like symptoms that were positive for this virus in a RT-PCR assay. these samples were collected from different pig farms across the u.s. between 2010 and 2012. it suggests the possibility of reassortment between subtypes, which could potentially generate viruses with phenotypes that may pose a threat to public health. influenza C virus is not readily isolated and cultured, and primary isolation can be challenged. identification and cultivation of the virus in the ST cell line is relatively straightforward. the emerging but puzzling question then is why this virus has not been identified until now. the predicted receptor binding for C/OK HE appears on the top face of the receptor binding domain similar to human influenza C HE protein. four out of nine residues of the receptor binding site and residues around the binding pocket of HE of human influenza C are retained in that of C/OK. the most notable difference is a reduction in the size of the 5-N-acetyl binding pocket of C/OK HE relative to C HE. the discovery of C/OK virus in pigs seems to challenge these accepted views. there is still a possibility that C/OK virus can be assigned as the prototype of a new genus of the Orthomyxoviridae family. preliminary reassortment experiments between C/OK and C/Taylor have failed to identify reassortant viruses. the ability of this novel pathogen to infect ferrets suggests such viruses may become a potential threat to human health. swabs were collected from 15-week-old pigs exhibiting influenza-like illness. cytopathic effects were evident by day 3 post inoculation. cytopathic effects were evident by day 3 post inoculation. rt-RT-PCR was performed using the MagMAX-96 viral RNA isolation kit. method
