{"summary": "the pleiotropic IL-4 cytokine acts as an essential proliferation signal [1], [2], although its effects on malignant cells can be anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic [3]\u2013[10]. experimental infection of resting B cells with EBV in culture regularly results in the establishment of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) with indefinite proliferation potential [13], [13]. the remaining transformation-associated proteins are mostly nuclear proteins (EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C and EBNA-LP) the remaining transformation-associated proteins are mostly nuclear proteins (EBNA1, EBNA2, EBNA3A, EBNA3B, EBNA3C and EBNA-LP), which again show no significant homology to cellular proteins. subset of genes that was differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts. mRNA changes relative to resting B cells largely reflected common changes associated with lymphocyte activation and cell proliferation. EBV infection of isolated CD19+ B cells was performed by incubation of cells at 37\u00b0C for 2 h with EBV at 100 m.o.i. and culturing at 37\u00b0C. parallel cultures of mitogen-stimulated B blasts were set up in cell culture medium containing 50 ng/ml of soluble trimeric human recombinant megaCD40L. cDNA was used as a template to generate fluorescently labelled cRNA by in vitro transcription. cRNA was purified and fragmented before being hybridised to the microarray chip. differentially expressed genes were identified using LIMMA [27] with a cut-off p value of 0.01. individual RT-qPCR assays for cellular transcripts were purchased from Applied Biosystems. cDNA was obtained by reverse-transcribing 20\u2013400 ng total RNA with random hexamer primers. health donors were recruited according to NHSBT standard procedures. parallel cultures of mitogen-stimulated B blasts were set up in cell culture medium containing 50 ng/ml of soluble trimeric human recombinant megaCD40L (Alexis Biochemicals) and 50 ng/ml IL-4 (ProSpec-Tany) wells were examined for transformed colonies after 6 weeks culture. Scanned images of microarray chips were analysed using the Affymetrix GeneChip Command Console. differentially expressed genes were identified using LIMMA [27] with a cut-off p value of 0.01.

IL-4 transcriptional targets were enriched for both ISGs and IRF-1 regulated genes. only genes that were annotated and common to both U133 plus 2 and Human Exon 1.0 ST Affymetrix array platforms (i.e. 16420 genes) were analysed. 12 0.94 0.047 0.828 Up-regulated by CD40L/IL4 (n = 370) 42 3.8 66.8 0.0001 Down-regulated by EBV (n = 370) 35 3.0 38.7 0.0001 Down-regulated by CD40L/IL4 (n = 263) 17 2.0 6.90 0.009 Differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL4 blasts (n = 249) 34 4.6 75 0.0001 Higher in EBV blasts than IL-4 regulated genes were identified experimentally by Elo et al who arrayed IL-2 stimulated T cells treated with or without IL-4. complete gene-lists are available in Data-File S2. link between IL-4 signaling and EBV infection was confirmed directly in our B cell model. infection attenuated the effects of IL4 on transcription in B cells. the results are expressed as mean SEM of three replicate experiments using B cells from different donors. 103 B cells were seeded into each of the 96-wells of a microtest plate. transformation efficiency, defined as the M.O.I. at which 50% of the cultures were transformed, was 23.83.2 for EBV alone and 56.510.2 for EBV plus IL-4. gene-sets up- or down-regulated in GC-LCLs were significantly and substantially enriched for those down-regulated by IL-4 in T cells. of the 21014 annotated genes in the U133 plus2 Affymetrix array platform, 484 were identified experimentally as being down-regulated and 640 up-regulated by IL-4 in T cells. the transcriptional profile induced by EBV in the GC-LCL model was shown previously to overlap that of HRS cells micro-dissected from cHL [37], [38]. the overlap between IL-4 transcriptional targets and genes found to be differentially expressed in micro-dissected HRS cells from 12 cHL when compared with non-malignant GC centrocytes. the odds of a gene up-regulated in GC-LCL cells also being up-regulated in HRS cells were almost 5 times greater (OR = 4.9; 95% CI = 2.9 to 8.5) when that gene was also down-regulated by IL-4 in T cells compared to when it was not (Figure 5). the odds of a gene up-regulated in GC-LCL cells also being up-regulated in HRS cells were almost 5 times greater (OR = 4.9; 95% CI gene-sets regulated by IL-4, in eBV-infected GC B cells and in micro-dissected HRS cells were identified as described in Tables 5 and 6. equal sized gene-sets were compared by ranking probe-sets according to the magnitude of FC of the HRS cells, and selecting the top 640 or 484 unique genes. 29/92 (32%) of these genes were indeed up-regulated by LMP1 (26 genes) or by LMP2A (5 genes) or both (2 genes) in GC-B cells. gene Symbol Ontology Genes up-regulated by both LMP1 and LMP2A. gene expression profiling identified 4197 and 1666 genes as significantly altered following EBV infection and CD40L/IL-4 stimulation. only 6 genes were significantly up-regulated by EBV and significantly down-regulated by CD40L/IL-4, or vice versa. significant changes in transcript expression were identified by paired LIMMA (p0.01; FC>1.5) and complete gene-lists are available in Data-File S2. Venn diagram indicating the overlap of the 4197 genes changed by EBV and the 1666 genes changed by CD40L/IL4. genes altered by EBV or by CD40L/IL4 on day 7 were determined by a paired LIMMA analysis with a significance threshold of P0.01; FC>1.5. 255 genes were differently expressed between EBV blasts and CD40L/IL-4 blasts (p0.01, FC>2) of which 138 were expressed higher in EBV blasts than in CD40L/IL-4 blasts. 117 were expressed lower in EBV blasts than in CD40L/IL-4 blasts ( 40L/IL-4 blasts was enriched for gene functions linked to the immune response. these initial analyses suggest that EBV and CD40L/IL-4 both concordantly and discordantly regulate different sets of immune response genes. ontology analysis of genes differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts was performed using the DAVID v6.7 bio. the list of probe-sets entered into DAVID v6.7 and the complete analyses readouts are given in Data-File S1. The probe-sets analyzed were those which were differentially expressed between EBV and CD40L/IL-4 blasts at day 7. the subset of differentially expressed genes that was expressed higher in EBV blasts than in CD40L/IL-4 blasts.

IL-4 transcriptional targets were enriched for both ISGs and IRF-1 regulated genes. only genes that were annotated and common to both U133 plus 2 and Human Exon 1.0 ST Affymetrix array platforms were analysed here.

IL-4 impairs EBV-induced B cell transformation. the dose of virus required for 50% transforming wells to be 23.83.2 (mean m.o.i. S.D.) for control EBV infections, and 56.5 10.2 for EBV plus IL-4. this represents a 2.4-fold reduction of transforming efficiency by EBV in the presence of IL-4. gene-sets up-regulated by IL-4 in GC-B cells were significantly and substantially enriched for those down-regulated by IL-4 in GC-LCLs. of the 21014 annotated genes in the U133 plus2. array platform, 484 were identified experimentally as being down-regulated and 640 up-regulated by IL-4 in T cells. BV-transformed LCL from GC-B cells relative to uninfected GC-B cells were identified by Leonard et al [37]. equal sized probe-sets were compared by ranking probe-sets according to the magnitude of FC of the GCB-LCL relative to uninfected GC-B cells. the transcriptional profile induced by EBV in the GC-LCL model was shown previously to overlap that of HRS cells micro-dissected IL-4-regulated genes were identified experimentally by Elo et al [35] of the 21014 annotated genes in the U133 plus2 Affymetrix array platform. of the 21014 annotated genes in the U133 plus2 Affymetrix array platform, 640 were identified as being up-regulated and 484 down-regulated by IL4 in T cells. comparison of eBV-positive and eBV-negative HRS tumors with normal GC cells gave essentially similar results. the odds of a gene up-regulated in GC-LCL cells also being up-regulated in eBL tumors were the same whether or not that gene was also down-regulated by IL-4 in T cells. genes up-regulated in HRS relative to GC-centrocytes and in EBV-transformed LCL relative to uninfected GC-B cells but down-regulated by IL-4 in T cells may be enriched for genes known to be transcriptional targets of LMP1 or LMP2A. 92 genes were identified as common to 2084 genes up-regulated in EBV-transformed LCLs established from GC-B cells [37], 1747 genes up-regulated in HRS [38], and 484 genes down-regulated by IL4 in T cells [35]. these 92 genes were then compared to those identified as up-regulated following expression of LMP1 or LMP2A in GC-B cells [41], [42]. EBV has the potential to activate several PRRs, including TLR3 and TLR7 [44], [45], and a role for viral RNAs, mostnotably the EBERs, in triggering IFN production and IFN responses. prevailing evidence suggests that EBV has to modulate these innate intracellular responses in order to successfully infect and persist in the cells. genes expressed at significantly lower levels in EBV blasts. one was RNF19B (expressed 2.9x lower in EBV blasts; p = 0.0012), a ubiquitin-protein ligase that targets substrates such as UCKL1 for degradation. uridine kinase/uracil phosphoribosyltransferase that binds to EBV EBNA3A, an interaction that leads to a nuclear accumulation of U this finding is consistent with the observation that IFNs and cytokines such as IL-4 are known to cross-regulate each other's signaling in different cell types. we were able to confirm in many cases that the induction by EBV of those ISGs that were differentially expressed in EBV blasts was reduced following infection in the presence of IL-4. this effect of IL-4 was correlated with a significant impairment of transformation efficiency. IL-4 impaired transformation-associated ISGs in malignant HRS cells. a substantial number of these are also concordantly up-regulated by LMP1 or LMP2A in normal GC B cells. proliferation of HL-derived lines in vitro and in vivo is reduced by antibodies to IL-13 or by decoy receptor molecules. the over-representation of ISG among genes found to be up-regulated in micro-dissected HRS cells are not reported. a recent study by Steidl et al [39] showed a remarkable similarity in their transcriptomes. a major signaling function of LMP1 is to constitutively activate NF-B [71]\u2013[73] and many EBV-negative cases of HL carry mutations of NF-B pathway genes that effect the same result analysis of gene-sets was performed as in Figure 5 except that the genes regulated in HRS cells were determined from the array data of Steidl et al [39] to facilitate analysis of statistical significance. equal sized probe-sets were compared by ranking probe-sets according to the magnitude of FC of the HRS cells, and selecting the top 640 or 484 unique genes. complete gene-lists are available in Data-File S2.
