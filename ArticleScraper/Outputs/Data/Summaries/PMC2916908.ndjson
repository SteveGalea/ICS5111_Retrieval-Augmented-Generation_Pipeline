{"summary": "a cross-sectional knowledge, attitudes and practices survey was conducted in the military from mid-August to early-October 2009 among 3054 personnel in four exposure groups. the mean age was 21.4 (SE 0.2) years old. close contacts had the highest knowledge score. studies have found that individual beliefs and perceptions play an important role in subsequent desired behavior change. higher perceived effectiveness of measures undertaken [3,4] and higher perceived threat of the disease also influenced both self and community protective behavior [7] the military conducted a cross-sectional survey in the military from mid-August 2009 to early-October 2009. the military comprises of conscript males who serve compulsory military service after high school. most servicemen stay in camp during weekdays and return to the community/home during weekends, resulting in interactions within the military and general communities. questionnaire was developed to assess knowledge, attitudes and practices regarding pandemic influenza. questionnaire collected demographic data on age, sex, ethnicity, education level and housing type. questions on attitudes were used to assess perceptions towards pandemic influenza. Tamiflu is effective for prophylaxis (prevention) against pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) Avoiding overseas travel to affected areas Avoiding people with flu symptoms Avoiding going outdoors Avoiding crowded places Avoiding public transport Avoiding large social gatherings Personal Habits Knowledge (The following will reduce the spread of influenza) Statistical analysis: responses within each group were normally distributed with standard deviation of 5%. 132 participants per group to achieve power of 0.9 and p = 0.05. risk perception questions were scored proportionate to risk perception. questionnaire collected basic demographic data on age, sex, ethnicity, education level and housing type. questions on knowledge were used to assess a servicemen's general knowledge on pandemic influenza and on the recommended response measures. questions on attitudes were used to assess perceptions towards pandemic influenza. I am ill Attitudes Mask Attitudes I think it is good to wear masks at home. Vaccination Attitudes I will be vaccinated against pandemic Influenza A (H1N1) if available. Do you feel that the influenza vaccine has any side effects. a total of 3054 survey forms were mailed out (465 patients/contacts, 1568 healthcare workers and 1021 to general servicemen) the response rates for patients/contacts, healthcare workers and other servicemen were 62.6%, 21.1% and 43.2% respectively. the majority of the respondents were males aged between 19-23 years old. value* Mean Age (SE) 21.4 (0.2) 20.6 (0.3) 20.6 (0.1) 23.2 (0.4) 20.5 (0.3) 0.001 -Inter quartile range 19 to 21 20 to 21 20 to 21 20 to 23 19 to 20 NA -Range 17 to 61 17 to 27 18 to 30 18 to 61 17 to 57 NA Sex: 1.
