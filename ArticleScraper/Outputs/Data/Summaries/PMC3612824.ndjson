{"summary": "the research community faced the challenge of developing alternative expression systems capable of ensuring correct post-translational modifications in RPs. the first successful production of transgenic mammals by the microinjection of genetically engineered constructs into the pronucleus of a mouse zygote was carried out over 20 years ago. the drug prevents blood clotting in patients with hereditary antithrombin deficiency. in 2011, the EMEA approved the use of the recombinant C1-esterase inhibitor produced in rabbits for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. RPs could carve out a significant niche in biotechnology in the near future. technology was initially tested on mice, and it remains a reliable method for the production of TAs. this is due to the low frequency of incorporation of recombinant DNA into the genome and the availability of zygotes at the two pronuclear stages. results depend on carrying out a large number of surgical procedures. the majority of recently generated large farm animals have been obtained by NT. however, the transfected cells are selected using antibiotic resistance marker genes. this complicates the approval of the produced recombinant proteins by the FDA and EMEA. transgenes require a relatively small number of blastocysts and a small experimental herd. ES cell lines for farm animals have yet to be obtained. TAs can be effectively produced using retroviruses containing the required transgene. the efficiency of the integration of the transgene depends on the type of transposon, transgene length, concentration and site of DNA injection. this approach results in a short-term nonhereditary production of RPs in the organ or tissue under consideration. it remains difficult to compare the efficiency of new and traditional methods for producing TAs. the 5\u2019- and 3\u2019-UTR s in a vector may belong to either one or different genes. structure of the pBC1 vector used for the production of recombinant proteins in transgenic animals and cell lines. the -casein gene promoter is one of the most efficient and is used for the production of target proteins in the mammary glands. gene construct RP/construct Regulatory elements TA/method of production Maximum level of RP production, mg/ml Reference Lactoferrin Native gene Bacmid Cow/NT 3.4 [16] Native gene WAP-gene (21 kb) (mouse) Mouse/MI 30 [21] \u2013\u201c\u2013 -casein promoter (goat) + insulator Mouse/MI 160 [22] \u2013\u201c\u2013 -casein promoter (goat) + insulator the use of a gene with an unmodified exon\u2013intron structure allows one to obtain much higher levels of target protein production in TAs. the concentration of recombinant lactoferrin did not exceed 4 mg/ml of mouse milk and 0.7 mg/ml of transgenic goat milk. the difference in the expression of recombinant lactoferrin using the S1-casein promoter of cows was similar (Table 1). the insulator from a cluster of chicken -globin genes (HS4 insulator) is one of the most intensely studied vertebrate insulators. it is 1200 bp long and is located at the 5\u2019-end of the -globin locus. some insulators can act as a boundary between the transcriptionally active chromatin and heterochromatin. pBC1 vector constructed by invitrogen (USA) for TAs production contains two 1.2-kb-long copies of the HS4 insulator at the 5\u2019-end of the vector. however, the HS4 insulator does not affect the variability of the transgene expression and its ectopic expression in other tissues of the organism. transgenic mice have been obtained whose mammary glands are characterized by high tissue-specific transgene expression. production of recombinant human lactoferrin in their milk was as high as 30 mg/ml. another method for obtaining TAs that efficiently produce target proteins is the integration of large DNA segments (up to 250 kb) into the genome. the use of a bacmid does not completely suppress the effect of the genomic surrounding. this can be attributed to the fact that the initiated RN A interference adversely affects the gene expression in a bacmid. the use of recombinant plasma proteins grows every year as the scope of their application expands. expression of human recombinant proteins (RPs) does not affect animal health and lactation [74, 75]. Table 2. Examples of the expression of human recombinant proteins (RPs) in the milk of transgenic animals. recombinant albumin is produced mostly in yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae (RecombuminTM) and Pichia pastoris (AlbrecTM) the demand for recombinant albumin is calculated in tons, since albumin is used not only in medicine, but also in biotechnology to stabilize other proteins. the production of rhAB in the milk of transgenic cows must be below 48 mg/ml. some proteins, such as hormones and cytokines, have a negative effect on the lactation and health of TAs. the main problem the company encountered was the effect of rhBChE on lactation. expression vector containing the 5\u2019-regulatory region of the CSN1S1 gene of a goat was also used. transgenic mice carrying this vector express rhG-CSF exclusively in milk, but not in other tissues. alternative way to produce RPs is infection of a mammary gland with replication-defective vectors based on adenoviruses. transgenic mice and rabbits were produced in whose milk the concentration of chimeric protein reached 0.3 and 0.5 mg/ml. recombinant human prourokinase was co-expressed with the bacterial serine protease inhibitor in the milk of transgenic mice. this allowed to purify the milk from the processed prourokinase. incorrect post-translational modifications can occur in the milk of transgenic goats and cows. rh-AFP is a single chain glycosylated plasma protein with a molecular weight of 68 kDa. the demand for a properly folded recombinant human alpha-fetoprotein is extremely high. mAbs are composed of two polypeptide chains, two constructs encoding heavy and light subunits were used for their expression in TAs. mAbs were expressed using various gene promoters of milk proteins, e.g., sheep -lactoglobulin [87] and mouse WAP [88, 89]. mAbs for pharmaceutical production were obtained from transgenic goats. two native genes 0.4 [90] Envelope glycoprotein S (gastroenteritis coronavirus) Mouse/two native genes 5 [89] Envelope glycoprotein S (gastroenteritis coronavirus) -lactoglobulin promoter (sheep) Mouse/two native genes 14 [86] BR96 anti-Lewis Y -casein promoter (goat) Mouse/two native genes 4 [86] CD20-receptor 210 transgenic goats whose milk contains mAbs at a concentration of 8 g/l can fully meet the world demand in anti-CD20 mAbs at an approximate cost of $100/g [85] despite the relatively low cost of mAb production in transgenic goats, there are some drawbacks associated with their use in comparison with the use of mammalian cell cultures. RN A-product induces inactivation of the genes involved in the glycosylation of RPs in the cell lines producing the recombinant proteins. the only possible option is to create TAs using a vector under strict control of expression exclusively in the mammary gland. the presence of approximately 0.3\u20130.5 mg/ml of endogenous immunoglobulins poses an additional problem during mAb purification. transgenic rabbits can become an attractive model for the production of this new class of highly active antibodies. a large-scale project to obtain mAbs in TAs was initiated in the late 1990s by Genzyme Transgenic company (currently known as GTC Biotherapeutics) mAbs were obtained in transgenic mice in order to assess their overall activity. human milk contains much higher concentrations of lactoferrin (2.0\u20135.8 mg/ml), lysozyme (0.8\u20133 mg/ml) and lactalbumin (1.8\u20133.1 mg/ml) these proteins protect the organism against infections, improve the structure of the intestinal epithelium, have a positive effect on the intestinal microflora, and enhance immunity. casein fraction in cow milk consists of -S1-, -S2-, - and k-caseins. cheese is made via the aggregation of casein micelles, which retain water and fat by forming a protein network. increased content of - and k-caseins leads to a reduction in the micellar size. transgenic pigs with the -lactalbumin gene of cows inserted into their genome. this resulted in an increase in lactose concentration in milk. the level of phosphates in the feces of the transgenic pigs decreased by 75%. the use of TAs in agriculture is highly promising. the main restriction to the widespread distribution of TAs is the fear of the wider public. more stringent regulatory requirements are imposed as a result. near future the use of TAs in the biotechnology and food industries will expand."}
