{"summary": "EBOV VP40 in exosomes causes recipient immune cell death. extracellular vesicle contents were characterized by mass spectrometry, cytokine array, and western blot. clones were accelerated in growth due to cyclin D1 upregulation. PBMCs maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin. 293T cells, VP40 clones, and HeLa cells were sustained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) transfected cells were treated the next day with hygromycin B (200\u2013400 g/mL) for plasmid selection. 21 new resistant clones were generated, which produced varying amounts of VP40.

PBMCs maintained in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% l-glutamine, and 1% streptomycin/penicillin. 293T cells, VP40 clones, and HeLa cells were sustained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) transfected cells were treated the next day with hygromycin B (200\u2013400 g/mL) for plasmid selection. 21 new resistant clones were generated, which produced varying amounts of VP40. two clones, an intermediate and a high VP40-producing clone, were selected to complement an existing low VP40-producing clone. NT particles are highly porous, multifunctional hydrogel particles. they are composed of high-affinity aromatic dye compounds. both particle types have a NIPAm-Bis-AA matrix with a shell lacking vinyl sulfonic acid. 5 g of VLP was spiked into 1 mL of sterile 1 PBS, followed by filtration (through 0.22 m) alongside a PBS control. resulting filtrate was then incubated with 30 L of NT80/82 particles. NT pellets were used the next day for SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were infected with EBOV H.sapiens-tc/COD/1995/Kikwit. two milliliters of supernatants were harvested, passed through a 0.22-m filter, and incubated with ExoMAX (1:1 reagent/filtered supernatant) reagent overnight at 4\u00b0C to concentrate EVs.

NT particle pellets were resuspended in 10 L of Laemmli buffer, heated at 95\u00b0C for 3 minutes, and vortexed 3 times until fully resuspended. gels were run at a maximum 150 V and wet-transferred overnight at 50 mA onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. VP40 and NP were detected as described above, whereas GP was detected with EBOV GP-specific antibody 6D8. membranes were then incubated with the appropriate horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody for 2 hours at 4\u00b0C. Luminescence was visualized on a bio-Rad. iodixanol (OptiPrep; Sigma) gradients were prepared in 1 PBS in 1.2% increments ranging from 6% to 18%. gradient was ultracentrifuged for 90 minutes at 100000 g in a rotor (Beckman) separated iodixanol fractions were pooled and resuspended in sterile 1 PBS. the number of exosomes was calculated using the standard curve. ZetaView nanoparticle tracking analysis was performed using the ZetaView Z-NTA (Particle Metrix) log-phase 293T and V2CH cells (1 106) were harvested, washed once in 1 PBS. ice cold CER II was added (5.5 L) to each sample, vortexed for 5 seconds, and incubated on ice for 1 minute. tubs were then vortexed, spun for 5 minutes at 16000 g. reactions were performed with IPed material (15 L), 50 g of appropriate peptide (780S [775RPPTLSPIPHIPR787], 780A [775RPPTLAPIPHIPR787] [ABclonal Science]) and [-32P] ATP (2 L) as substrates in TTK kinase buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 10 mM MgCl2, 6 mM EGTA, samples were sonicated and used for IP with 1 g of -RNA Pol II, -p300 (Santa Cruz), or -VP40 (IBT Bioservices) at 4\u00b0C overnight. a 30% slurry of A/G beads (Calbiochem) was added and incubated for 2 hours at 4oC. the absolute quantification of the samples was determined based on the cycle threshold value relative to the standard curve. PCR reactions were carried out in triplicate using the CFX96 Real Time System (Bio-Rad) mass spectrometry The EVs from NT80/82 NT particle-processed 10.8 and 12.0 iodixanol fractions were treated with 8 M of urea with 10 mM of DTT. ten milliliters of supernatants were incubated 1:1 with ExoMAX at 4\u00b0C overnight, spun down, resuspended, and separated on an OptiPrep iodixanol gradient. the 10.8 and 12.0 iodixanol fractions for each cell type were combined and used side-by-side with unprocessed cell supernatants. a new series of 293T cells were transfected with EBOV VP40 plasmid (pcDNA3.1/Hygro) and treated them with hygromycin B for plasmid selection. after >3 weeks culture, surviving colonies (total of 21 clones) were isolated and cultured for 5 days. most of the V2C lines (19 of 21) produced similar levels of VP40 in EV western blot analysis. control 293T cells retained similar phenotypes at 5 days compared with 2 days. VP40 donor cells expressed greater cell viability at G1/S and G2/M. phenotype occurred within VP40 clones. 293T, V2CL, and V2CH cells were seeded in a 96-well plate at 5 105 cells in 100 L of fresh media. they had clumped together to form structures that closely resembled viral synapses. it is possible that these structures may represent a potential synaptic mechanism used by EBOV in epithelial cell infection. Blocked cells were then imaged (A) and assayed for cell viability via CellTiter-Glo (B) the same experiment was repeated; however, cells were allowed to incubate for 5 days after blocking. increased levels of cyclin D1 have previously been shown to result in accelerated cell cycling. several viruses, including HTLV-1, HPV, EBV, human neurotropic JC virus, have previously been shown to influence the levels of cyclin D in infected cells to aid in their viral life cycle. all samples incubated for 1 hour, followed by dotting onto whatman glass microfiber filters. filters were incubated in 1 TE buffer with gentle agitation for 2 days, dried, and then quantified with a scintillation counter. the absolute quantification of the samples was determined based on the cycle threshold value relative to the standard curve generated from serial dilutions of DNA from 293T cells. data are presented as percentage (%) of the input (DNA purified from sonicated samples before IP with specific antibodies) incubation with Fascaplysin did not completely ameliorate the cyclin D1 activity. this finding could be due to an overall greater amount of cyclin D1 present in V2CH cells. previous studies have shown the intriguing presence of EBOV VP40 within the nucleus. VP40 protein was present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of V2CH cells. the levels of VP40 in the nuclear fraction were nearly equivalent with those seen in the cytoplasmic compartment. we hypothesized that VP40 may potentially act as a transcription factor for the cyclin D1 promoter to elicit increased levels of cyclin D1. VP40 may be responsible for upregulated transcription of cyclin D1. additional consequences of this abundance of nuclear VP40 are likely. the PBMCs received a 1-time treatment of 50 IU/mL of interleukin-2 the day before transfection. control cells received attractene treatment alone. cell viability was assayed 3 days post-transfection. 293T and V2CL cells were blocked at G0 (starvation; 0.1% fetal bovine serum DMEM), G1/S (20 mM of hydroxyurea) and G2/M (18-hour 20 mM of hydroxyurea pretreatment, followed by release for 1 hour and subsequent treatment with 50 ng/mL of nocodazole) for 5 days. one milliliter of filtered supernatant from blocked and control cells was incubated with 30 L of NT80/82 particles overnight at 4\u00b0C. the next day, the NT pellets were isolated, washed, and subjected to AChE assay for quantification of exosomes. exosomes and EVs are produced in a cell cycle-dependent manner. cells producing VP40 may have altered pattern of cell cycle-driven exosomal production. v2CL cells had significantly larger vesicles produced at G0 compared with 293T cells. taView analysis detects the total number of vesicles or large particles present, with exosomes comprising only a fraction of these. it is possible to clearly separate out exosomes from potentially contaminating viral particles, thus making more detailed characterization of specific EV populations possible. a shift to the right of the major CD63+CD9+CD81+ population from fractions 10.8\u201312.0 in 293T EVs to fractions 12.0\u201314.4 was observed. a population with high levels of CD9 and CD81 and low levels of CD63 was seen from fractions 15.6\u201318.0, similar to 293T cells. VP40 protein was seen to be enriched in each of the 3 vesicle populations, especially in fraction 18.0. supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.22 m), and analyzed by ZetaView for size (peak [mode] diameter) (A) and concentration of particles (B) additional Student\u2019s 2-tailed t test compares cell cycle-blocked groups with controls of their own cell type. Western blot of 293T (A) and V2CI (B) fractions were analyzed for levels of VP40, CD63, CD81, CD9, and Actin. EVs and exosomes below 220 nm in diameter will be able to pass through 0.22-m filter for downstream analysis. we spiked 10 g of VLPs into 10 mL of V2CH supernatants. the material was then left unfiltered and incubated with a vesicle-enrichment agent. the material was then loaded on top of qEV exclusion columns. the larger glycosylated form of GP decreased while the levels of lower molecular weight forms of GP increased. in the filtered fractions, the larger form of GP was present only at very low levels, whereas lower molecular weight GP levels were relatively high. together, these results suggest that glycosylated GPs may be the principal form within VLPs. all 3 EBOV proteins were most highly concentrated in fraction number 8. VP40 and NP were also present in fraction number 7, whereas GP was present at very low levels in this fraction. this fraction may represent slightly larger vesicles that do not incorporate GP. negative control (Null) samples consisted of purified exosomes from uninfected HUVECs. negative control (Null) samples consisted of purified exosomes from uninfected HUVECs. sitometry was used to calculate the approximate amounts of VP40 present in our V2CH cell EVs and how much was released from infected NHP samples. VP40 composed on average approximately 55.8% of purified VLPs. it is interesting to note that more VP40 was present from NHP 2 serum, which succumbed to infection sooner (day 7 vs day 12) we incubated CEM, Jurkat, U937, and 293T cells with 5-day filtered supernatants from 293T, V2CL, and V2CH cells. results show that CEM and Jurkat T cells had a similar reduction in cellular viability from treatment with supernatants from both lines. however, treatment of U937 monocytes with supernatants from these 2 lines showed a dose-dependent reduction in cellular viability. 293T, V2CL, CEM, Jurkat, and U937 cells were grown in exosome-free media for 5 days, followed by harvesting and filtering (0.22 m) of the supernatant. cells were incubated for 5 days, followed by harvesting and lysis. EVs from 293T cells stimulated some low levels of PARP-1 cleavage. however, there was no cleavage of Caspase 3 detected. EVs from VP40-producing cells cause death by apoptosis in recipient cells and monocytes. resulting ultracentrifuged EVs were determined with ZetaView analysis. controls included CEM cells that were left untreated and CEM cells that received a treatment of the highest concentration of 293T cells (75000 particles/cell) cells were incubated for 3 days followed by analysis of cell viability by CellTiter-Glo. supernatants from 293T and V2CI cells were harvested and separated through an iodixanol gradient. pooling of fractions 13.2 + 14.4 and 16.8 + 18.0 were chosen because, in V2CI cells, these were the 2 groups with the highest levels of VP40 and exosomal markers. cdk4/6 inhibitors Fascaplysin and Ribociclib (LEE011; FDA-approved) in reducing EV production from 293T and V2CH cells. cells were treated for 5 days with increasing concentrations of Fascaplysin (0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 M) and Ribociclib (0.1, 1.0, and 10.0 M) scaplysin treatment results in fewer EVs from V2CH cells compared with 293T cells with higher doses. the indication that 293T cells react to both cdk4/6 inhibitors in a similar way, but V2CH cells do not, hints these drugs may impact cell cycle regulation and EV biogenesis pathways in distinct ways. 293T, V2CL, and V2CH cells were cultured for 5 days in exosome-free media. supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.22 m), and incubated with ExoMAX. samples were then loaded onto a 6%\u201318% OptiPrep iodixanol gradient. 2CH EVs had 387, 1393, and 1680 proteins identified, respectively. these results could potentially indicate that the total number of EVs had shifted from the 10.8 fraction more towards the 12.0 fraction for V2C cells. 293T cells possibly possessed more EVs in the 10.8 fraction in comparison to the 12.0 fraction. cytokines include granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), growth-regulated oncogene (GRO-), IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-15, IL-18, interferon (IFN-, -, and -, IFN-inducible protein-10 (IP10), Eotaxin, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP) 293T cell supernatants were slightly more enriched in several different cytokines (GRO, GRO-, I-309, IL-1, IL-1, and IFN-) however, an increase in almost all cytokine levels was observed compared with those seen in whole supernatants. additional cytokines that were undetectable in whole supernatants that were found in exosomal samples included IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5 VEGF, TGF-1, and PDGF BB were present in 293T and V2CH exosomes at similar levels. a plethora of cytokines are associated with vesicles released from virally affected and healthy host cells. a plethora of cytokines may be concentrated within EVs from cells producing VP40. most of the V2C lines (19 of 21) produced similar levels of VP40 in EV western blot analysis. however, 2 lines, V2CI and V2CH, produced lower and higher levels of VP40, respectively, in comparison to the rest of the clones. this finding indicates that these 2 clones may produce higher levels of EVs with differential amounts of VP40 packaged. after 2 days of cell cycle blocks, all cell types had the expected morphology and viability with minimal cell death. results from the corresponding 2-day cell viability assay indicated that all blocked cells had reduced viability, as would also be expected with functioning cell cycle blocks. cells producing VP40 may have accelerated rates of growth directly proportional to the amount of VP40 being produced. VP40-producing cells may be able to push past cell cycle blocks imposed by external or internal influences, indicating a dysregulation of cell cycle checkpoints. VP40 increases functional Cyclin D1 levels in donor cells. cdk2, -4, -6, and cyclin E showed only a small upregulation. cyclin D1 increased in a dose-dependent manner with increasing VP40 produced. western blot analysis of cyclin D1 (CycD1), cyclin E (CycE), cyclin B1 (CycB1), cdk4, cdk6, cdk2, cdk1 and actin levels. five hundred micrograms of 293T or V2CH whole-cell extracts were used for IP with 10 g of either normal rabbit immunoglobulin G (IgG) or -CycD log phase 293T and V2CH cells (3 106) were harvested and cross-linked with 1% formaldehyde for 1 hour followed by quenching with 1.25 glycine. 100 L of each sample (corresponding to approximately 5 105 cells) was used for IP with 1 g of anti-Pol II, -p300, or -VP40 at 4\u00b0C overnight. the next day, Protein A/G (30% slurry) was added and incubated for 2 hours at control 293T and V2CH whole-cell extracts were immunoprecipitated with -cyclin D1 or IgG. in 293T cells, active cyclin D1 complexes phosphorylated the 780S peptide as expected. incubation with Fascaplysin did not completely ameliorate the cyclin D1 activity on the 780S peptide. VP40 is present in the nucleus and Binds the Cyclin D1 promoter. previous studies have shown the intriguing presence of EBOV VP40 within the nucleus, especially at early time points in infection. pol II, p300, and VP40 were 3% of the DNA input in 293T and V2CH cells. the background levels of these, particularly VP40, may be partially attributed to nonspecific binding of proteins during the IP procedure during ChIP. p300 increased more than 4-fold to 11.11% of DNA input in V2CH cells. PBMCs were transfected with attractene and 1.5 g of cytomegalovirus-VP40 plasmid. VP40 alters exosome biogenesis in a cell cycle-dependent maner. control 293T and V2CL cells were blocked at G0, G1/S, and G2/M stages of the cell cycle. side-by-side analyses of EV contents and AChE activity of the exosomes produced from cell cycle blocked cells were performed. 93T and V2CL cells were blocked at G0 (starvation; 0.1% fetal bovine serum DMEM), G1/S (20 mM of hydroxyurea) and G2/M (18-hour 20 mM of hydroxyurea pretreatment, followed by release for 1 hour and subsequent treatment with 50 ng/mL of nocodazole) for 5 days. analysis of exosomal markers from cell cycle-blocked EVs revealed an increase in all forms of CD63 at G0 compared with 293T cells. at G0, the number of exosomes was reduced by >1 log compared with unsynchronized control exosomes for both cell types. this finding was corroborated by the distinct reduction of most ESCRT and exosomal proteins at G0 compared with levels at G1/S and G2/M phases. vesicles from V2C cells decreased in number in a VP40 level-dependent manner when compared with 293T cells. vesicles from all 3 cell types decreased in number in a VP40 level-dependent manner when compared against 293T cells. in 293T cells, CD63+CD9+CD81+ (exosome) fractions fell into 3 distinct categories. first, fractions 8.4\u201312.0 contained high levels of CD63 and moderate levels of CD9 and CD81. previous publications have classified this group as true exosomes. supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.22 m) and analyzed by ZetaView for size (peak [mode] diameter (A) and concentration of particles (B) supernatants were harvested, filtered (0.22 m) and analyzed by ZetaView for size (peak [mode] diameter (A) and concentration of particles (B) 293T and VP40 cells were grown in exosome-free media for 5 days. the EVs were pelleted, resuspended in 300 L of sterile 1 PBS. samples were ultracentrifuged for 90 minutes at 100000 g. EVs and exosomes below 220 nm in diameter will be able to pass through 0.22-m filtration for downstream analysis. filtration of VLPs in small volumes drastically reduced levels of EBOV proteins present to undetectable levels. unsurprisingly, proteins originating from unfiltered VLPs mostly appeared in the first fraction after the void volume of the column (fraction no. 7), with some overlap into the next 1\u20132 fractions. however, upon filtration through 0.22 m, approximately all EBOV proteins vanished from fraction number 7 and there was a sizeable reduction in the levels of GP and NP. VP40 is present at Varying Levels in Extracellular Vesicles In Vitro and In Vivo. to address this, we infected HUVECs with EBOV/Kik (MOI of 1) for 3 days. VP40, NP, and GP were all present in EVs concentrated from EBOV-infected cells. GP and NP are packaged into vesicles in cells actively infected with EBOV. two milliliters supernatant were harvested, passed through a 0.22-m filter. EVs were pelleted, resuspended in 0.5 mL 1 PBS, and loaded on qEV columns. twenty-five microliters NT80/82 particles were incubated with the filtered samples at 4\u00b0C overnight. the next day, NT pellets were washed once in 1 PBS, resuspended in 12 L Laemmli buffer, run on 4\u201320% SDS/PAGE. inactivated samples were filtered, EVs were concentrated with NT80/82 particles, and samples were analyzed by western blot for levels of VP40 and VP40, NP, and GP1,2 are present in EVs from cells infected with EBOV. these results indicate that relatively high levels of VP40, NP, and GP1,2 are present in EVs from cells infected with EBOV both in vitro and in vivo. VP40 in extracellular Vesicles induces Apoptosis in bystander T cells. 293T cells showed a significant increase in viability, potentially indicating a cell-type dependent mechanism of cell death induction by EV-associated VP40. supernatants from 293T (Control), V2CL, and V2CH cells were used to treat CEM, Jurkat, and 293T recipient cells. cells were incubated for 5 days, followed by harvesting of the cells and lysis. western blots were performed for cell death markers including caspase 3 and PARP-1. the mechanism of cell death under these conditions has not been previously explored. 293T and V2CH cells were grown in exosome-free media for 5 days. resulting EV pellets were then resuspended in sterile 1 PBS. cell-free supernatants were harvested and incubated with equal volumes of ExoMAX overnight at 4\u00b0C. samples were ultracentrifuged for 90 minutes at 100000 g. resulting EV pellets were resuspended in 100 L sterile 1 PBS. cells were incubated for 5 days followed by analysis of viability. treatment with EVs from the 13.2 + 14.4 fractions from V2C cells resulted in a significant decrease in viability in CEM cells. on the other hand, T cells treated with the 16.8 + 18.0 fractions from either cell type did not differ in their viability. EVs within the 13.2 and 14.4 fractions from V2C cells can induce cell death in recipient immune cells. low levels of cdk4/6 inhibitors in 293T cells may result in the blocking of cell cycle at G1. higher levels of the drugs may become toxic, and result in the increased release of vesicles. v2CH cells showed significantly decreased levels of EV production with all doses of Fascaplysin. 293T and V2CH cells were treated with low, medium, and high concentrations of Fascaplysin (0.1, 0.5, 1.0 M) or Ribociclib (0.1, 1.0, 10.0 M) for 5 days. DMSO was also used at a final concentration of 1%. samples were then loaded onto a 6%\u201318% OptiPrep iodixanol gradient. 10.8 and 12.0 fractions were harvested for use. previous publications have shown that these fractions are specifically enriched for exosomes. several dEAD-box protein (DDX)-type helicases were upregulated in EVs from VP40-producing cells. of particular interest, 3 cytokines and 2 corresponding binding proteins were found to be present in the EVs. MCSF, RANTES, TGF-1, TNF-, and VEGF have all been implicated as differentially up- or downregulated during EBOV pathogenesis. this led us to question whether additional cytokines could potentially be present or upregulated in VP40 exosomes or EVs. cytokines that were undetectable in whole supernatants were found in 293T and V2CH exosomes at similar levels. a plethora of cytokines are associated with vesicles released from virally affected and healthy host cells. specific cytokines may be concentrated within EVs from cells producing VP40. this may potentially play a role in the cytokine storm associated with the pathogenesis of EBOV. VP40-containing vesicles can induce cell death by apoptosis in recipient cells. this cell death was more exacerbated in monocytes treated with EVs. high V2C cells showed an increased cell viability. this could be due to a cell type-dependent mechanism of action on recipient cells by VP40-associated vesicles. the resistance of certain cell types could be quite significant in the context of infection. cyclin D1 is a potential oncogene known to be upregulated in several cancers. cyclin D1 was previously shown to be produced at elevated levels as a result of many viral infections. EBOV has not been shown to result in higher incidences of cancer in survivors. VP40 is present at relatively high levels within the nucleus of stably transfected cells. it may be possible that early in infection, VP40 translocation into the nucleus may serve a role in transcriptional regulation of host genes to best benefit the virus. eukaryotic cells are quiescent in normal, healthy, in vivo environments. a collection of RNA-binding proteins was found from MS analysis of EVs from V2C cells. an assortment of cytokines was also found, with an upregulation of IFN-, IL-15, MCP-1, and TGF-1 seen in VP40 EVs. this may indicate that VP40 stimulates the production of some of these. the differences between 293T and V2CH cell responses suggest that VP40-producing cells may be less susceptible to the effects of Ribociclib. EBOV VP40 is packaged into exosomes in VP40-transfected cells. NP is responsible for binding of the RNA genome of the virus. VP40 dysregulated the cell cycle in donor cells through translocation to the nucleus and upregulation of functional cyclin D1 protein. extracellular vesicles from VP40 cells were also altered in their content, which included RNA-binding proteins and cytokines important for EBOV pathogenesis. VP40 dysregulated the cell cycle in donor cells through translocation to the nucleus. the posted materials are not copyedited and are the sole responsibility of the authors. questions or comments should be addressed to the author."}
