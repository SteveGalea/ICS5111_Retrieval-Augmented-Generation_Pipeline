{"summary": "as of July 2003, the world health organization reported a total of 8,437 people afflicted with SARS with a 9.6% mortality rate. but little is known about how the genome-wide gene expression of the host changes under the attack of SARS-CoV. we ranked the severity of recovering SARS patients by generalized associate plots. the genome-wide changes in human gene expression when challenged by this novel pathogen are essentially unknown. the variation in gene expression patterns in the blood of healthy subjects was strikingly smaller than the significant changes induced by diseases either in patients with cancer or with bacterial infections. cDNA microarrays spotted with duplicated 7,334 cDNA clone analyzed RNA specimens successfully amplified in 44 peripheral blood collected from 25 confirmed SARS patients. we defined 11 specimens as acute SARS (AS) using following criteria: (i) the whole blood RNA from a hospitalized patient was PCR positive for SARS-CoV. the rest of 33 RNA specimens from SARS patients were labelled as recovering SARS (RS) gene expression profiles of either SARS or bacterial groups differed significantly from that of normal controls. a probe set with 6,525 annotated genes was analyzed by (A) variation distribution in peripheral blood specimens from patients with acute SARS (AS), recovering SARS (RS), bacterial infections (IN) and normal controls (NC) in the first set, we contrasted 11 AS versus 22 non-AS (NC and IN) specimens. the genes with significant testing results were considered to be specifically induced by SARS-CoV. neighbour method was used to obtain a near optimal number of 30 genes from the 885 filtered gene set for discriminating specimens between acute SARS (AS) and non-SARS (NC and IN) the selected top 30 upregulated (P 6 10-6) and the top 30 downregulated genes (P 4 10-7) were used as the specific probe set to assess the status of SARS infection. eight genes that were also significant in the NC versus non-AS (AS and IN) t-test were excluded, resulting in a pair-wise matrix that was sorted by a GAP using 52 genes with the highest discriminating power for AS groups revealed the minimum anti-Robinson events in the matrix. a smooth transition order of the AS and RS specimens from severely diseased to healthy states. RS38, RS40, and RS42 still represented acute SARS infections. they were collected 1, 2, and 3 days after AS37, AS39, and AS41. patients with RS78 and RS91 who had severe SARS courses were hospitalized for 41 and 51 days. sixteen out of 17 SARS patients who submitted multiple blood specimens showed a similar trend of changes in the GAP-derived severity rank along with the recovery from the disease. patients with 2 (n = 15) and 3 specimens (n = 2) were labeled with blue and green lines, respectively. 11 normal control (NC) volunteers and 11 patients with bacterial infections (IN) as healthy and non-SARS infection controls. cDNA microarray analysis compared gene expression profiles among acute SARS (AS), recovering SARS (RS), bacterial infection (IN) and normal control (NC) groups to be equally higher than that in healthy controls (NC) Singular value decomposition (SVD) analysis successfully separated AS, IN, and NC specimens into three clusters with first two eigenvectors. the recovering SARS samples are interspersed among the AS and IN samples. most of the genes specifically upreguated by SARS-CoV are ESTs (13/20 genes) that were not annotated previously (Fig. 2a). k-nearest-neighbour method was used to obtain a near optimal number of 30 genes from the 885 filtered gene set for discriminating specimens between acute SARS (AS) and non-SARS (NC and IN) the GAP algorithm derived a smoother transition pattern than other methods in the Robinson sense. thereby, we have derived the SARS severity rank according to the expression profile of 52 signature genes as a whole in each patient. the same GAP procedure was repeatedly applied to the top 20 to 200 genes (among the filtered 885 genes) the ranks for the 55 specimens obtained from the most significant 20 to 200 genes are highly correlated to each other. but they are significantly different from the ranks derived from the 52-gene sets that were randomly selected from the 885 genes. we examined the clinical courses of patients who donated the 10 RS specimens that were scattered among AS (Fig. 3a) the rank of SARS severity was also significantly (P 0.001) correlated with the CPIS. these results demonstrate a correlation between the molecular severity rank and clinical factors, suggesting the usefulness of the molecular signature as a genome-wide parameter for gauging the severity of SARS patients. the first human encounter with SARS-CoV might provoke a set of human genes that were poorly annotated due to disuse. the detection of a comprehensive gene expression profile may not be cost-effective for clinical diagnosis and evaluation of patients with infectious diseases. however, in a complex system such as the human body where genes interplay through intricate circuitries, it is inadequate to examine only a few routine parameters in biochemistry and blood cell counts. RNA isolation from 10 out of 54 SARS specimens and RNA amplification were performed in the Biosafety Level 3 laboratory. this limitation resulted in the failed generation of aRNA from 10 out of 54 SARS specimens. this limitation resulted in the failed generation of aRNA from 10 out of 54 SARS specimens. two additional blood samples (RS94 and RS97) were collected from apparently healthy individuals who recovered from SARS infection 3 months later. total RNA was isolated with the PAXgene Blood RNA System (Qiagen, USA) and stored at -80\u00b0C. the optical density (O.D.) was measured at 450 nm wavelength. the cutoff value of O.D. for SARS-CoV IgG ELISA was 0.15. real-time quantitative PCR analysis for SARS-CoV was performed with Cor-p-F4, Cor-p-R4 and Cor-probe. we obtained the similar gene expression profiles from replicated samples (RS88) using the hierarchical clustering analysis and also got the highly correlated results (r2 = 0.84) from two specimens (AS37 and RS38) that were collected from the same patient at a time interval of only one day. patient information and specimen preparation Blood specimens of 25 SARS patients were collected from 10 May to 4 July 2003 at Kaohsiung Medical Center of Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (CGMH) two additional blood samples were collected from apparently healthy individuals who had recovered from SARS infection 3 months later. with horseradish peroxidase, the optical density (O.D.) was measured at 450 nm wavelength. the cutoff value of O.D. for SARS-CoV IgG ELISA was 0.15. pro 4.1 software carried out within-slide normalization using programs written with MATLAB 6.0 software (the MathWorks, Inc., CA, USA) to assure the reproducibility of our microarray system, we got the similar gene expression profiles from replicated samples (RS88) using the hierarchical clustering analysis and also got the highly correlated results (r2 = 0.84) from two specimens. authors' contributions Lee YS, Chen CH and Wang TH designed the study and prepared the manuscript.
