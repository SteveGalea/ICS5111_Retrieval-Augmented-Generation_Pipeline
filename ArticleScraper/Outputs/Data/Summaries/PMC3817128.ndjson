{"summary": "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD dehydrogenase) is the key enzyme that catalyzes the first reaction, the oxidation of glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone, in the pentose phosphate pathway. NADPH plays an important role in maintaining the supply of reduced glutathione to counterbalance oxidant-induced oxidative stress. most studies have focused on investigating the antibiotic-induced hemolysis after treatment for bacterial infection. a case report showed that infection by Clostridium difficile may have triggered hemolysis and led to severe jaundice in a G6PD-deficient neonate. another case report described hemolysis caused by Acinetobacter baumannii infection [13,14] vancomycin is one of the primary choices to treat infections resulting from multidrug-resistant S. aureus, including methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) the vancomycin-treated strain did enhance cytotoxicity through the activation of B and alternation of virulence expression. RNAi plasmids were generated by ligation of complementary oligonucleotides into the pCI-neo mammalian expression vector followed by transfection into A549 cells. cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 U/ml) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere of air and time-kill curves were then constructed by plotting the mean colony counts (log10 CFU/ml) versus time from three experiments. cells were treated as described above followed by two washes in a fluorescence microscope. apoptosis/necrosis was visualized by annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide (PI) staining with a commercial apoptosis detection kit. DAPI was employed to stain the cell nucleus, producing blue fluorescence. the cells were lysed in lysis buffer described elsewhere. the protein concentration of the lysate was determined by the Bradford method. blots were photographed using an X-OMAT 2000 film processor. cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco BRL) and subcultured in 10 ml BHI broth. at 37\u00b0C with the specific required antibiotics (Sigma) in a humidified atmosphere of air and 5% CO2. bacterial infection of cells was performed by inoculating with SJC1200. bacteria were plated on agar for enumeration of the surviving cfus. time-kill curves were then constructed by plotting colony counts versus time from three experiments. intracellular ROS was visualized by detecting dichlorofluorescein (DCF) derived from the oxidation of dihydrodichlorofluorescein (H2DCFDA; Invitrogen) at 12 h post-infection, cells were washed three times with PBS. at 16 h post-infection, cells were washed three times with PBS. flow cytometry analysis was performed using a FACSCalilbur (BD Bioscience) the cells were excited with the 488 nm laser and green apoptotic cells were detected at 530 nm. red necrosis cells were detected at 620 nm. no fluorescence could be detected in live cells. the results show that cell viability of both A549-5S-5 and A549-5.20 cell lines was decreased at 16 h post-infection. however, A549-5.20 cell viability (50%) was significantly less (P 0.05) than that of A549-5S-5 cells (69%). the average level of green fluorescence intensity was higher in VRSA-infected cells than in untreated cells of both the A549-5S-5 and A549-5.20 cell lines. treatment with vancomycin showed no obvious effect on the fluorescence intensity of either cell line upon VRSA infection. a slight increase in ROS production was observed in vancomycin-treated control cells when compared to vancomycin-free cells of both cell lines. a bacterial killing kinetic assay was performed to rule out reduced ROS accumulation. slower bacterial growth was observed in the presence than in the absence of vancomycin. at 12 h post-infection, aliquots of bacteria-infected cell culture media were removed and plated on agar. the quantification assay for apoptotic activity was evaluated by flow cytometry. the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic cells increased to 15.39% in VRSA-infected A549-5S-5 cells at 16 h post-infection. treated VRSA infection in both A549-5S-5 and A549-5.20 cells. weak cleaved caspase-8 expression was found in bacteria-free cells. a similar signal strength was found to trigger the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. -hemolysin inhibitor Oroxylin A was added to the media. hemolysis was inhibited when SJC 1200 cells were inoculated. treatment alone showed no significant effect on the accumulation of ROS or cell apoptosis. the results show that cell viability of both a549-5S-5 and a549-5.20 cell lines was decreased at 16 h post-infection. however, a549-5.20 cell viability (50%) was significantly less (P 0.05) than that of a549-5S-5 cells (69%). the average level of green fluorescence intensity was higher in VRSA-infected cells than in untreated cells of both the A549-5S-5 and A549-5.20 cell lines. treatment with vancomycin showed no obvious effect on fluorescence intensity of either cell line upon VRSA infection. however, a slight increase in ROS production was observed in vancomycin-treated control cells. vancomycin treatment alone showed a slight but non-significant increase in ROS production in both cell lines. slower bacterial growth was observed in the presence than in the absence of vancomycin for the first 9 hours. at 12 h post-infection, aliquots of bacteria-infected cell culture media were removed and plated on agar. apoptosis/necrosis was visualized by Annexin V/PI staining. the third row represents the merge of fluorescence image of Annexin V, PI, and DAPI. the quantification assay for apoptotic activity was evaluated by flow cytometry. cleaved caspase-8 expression was found in bacteria-free A549-5.20 cells. a weak cleaved caspase-8 expression was found in bacteria-free A549-5.20 cells. this suggests a similar signal strength to trigger the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. in plays a role in the accumulation of more ROS and enhanced apoptotic activity in G6PD-deficient cells. reduced hla expression and hemolytic activity was observed in strain SJC1200 upon vancomycin treatment. -hemolysin inhibitor Oroxylin A was added to the media was quantified by flow cytometry. totic activity was evaluated by flow cytometry. the percentages of apoptotic and necrotic cells are presented as the meanssd of three separate experiments. apoptosis signal-regulated kinase 1 (ASK1) is activated upon oxidative stress, leading to cell apoptosis. the caspases play essential roles in apoptosis. expression of active caspase-9, as well as the downstream caspase-3, was much higher in G6PD-deficient cells than in control scramble cells upon VRSA infection. a recent study showed that the incubation of epithelial cells with enterotoxin isolated from Aeromonas veronii increased the accumulation of intracellular ROS leading to a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. -hemolysin should be the major cause of mitochondria dysfunction. -hemolysin was decreased in SJC1200 upon vancomycin treatment. vancomycin treatment alleviated the VRSA infection-enhanced ROS accumulation. bacterial infection leads to an increase in ROS production in patients with G6PD deficiency. the impaired reconversion of glutathione disulphide to reduced glutathione caused by the imbalanced NADPH/NADP+ redox state renders the cell unable to remove ROS effectively. the accumulation of excess ROS results in stronger cell apoptosis through the mitochondrial pathway."}
