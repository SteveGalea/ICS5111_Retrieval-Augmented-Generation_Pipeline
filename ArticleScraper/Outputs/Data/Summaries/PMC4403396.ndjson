BLASTx alignment against the NCBI nonredundant (nr) protein database was previously described (26), in order to identify divergent viral sequences. the complete genome of the lesavirus 2 was amplified by RT-PCR in four overlapping fragments. the VP1 sequence for LV1 was amplified from nucleic acid extracted from fecal specimens collected in 2012 and 2013 from a ring-tailed lemur, Mis101308. nucleic acid extracted from fecal specimens was amplified using primer set LV2-2F and LV2-2r. diversity plots were generated with Simplot (30), employing sliding windows of 250 amino acids in length and a step size of 10 amino acids. a total of 10,000,000 MCMC states were run with a 25% burn-in period under a lognormal relaxed clock and Yule prior. the best-fit model of protein evolution was determined by ProtTest v 2.4 (32). nucleotide sequences were aligned by Muscle (29) and primer sequences were trimmed from the alignment. a phylogeny was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. standard precautions were taken to avoid end product contamination. sequences of genomes of lesavirus 1 and lesavirus 2, VP1 sequences, amplicons obtained through screening, and cytochrome B amplicon sequences have been entered into the GenBank database. the lemurs were housed in 9 single-species exhibits (ring-tailed lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, coquerel's sifakas, mongoose lemurs, a blue-eyed black from 3,349,958 total sequencing reads in a ring-tailed lemur, we identified 20 reads that had limited sequence identity to known picornaviruses. the genome of typical picornaviruses includes a single open reading frame, flanked by untranslated regions at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends. this virus was named lesavirus 1 (LV1; lemur stool-associated picornavirus 1). the 2A protein was conserved in LV1 (N970PGP) and LV2 (N949PGP) the putative 2C proteins had both the GXXGXGKS NTP binding motif (LV1, G1250RPGQGKS; LV2, G1231KPGQGKS) and the DDLXQ helicase activity motif (LV1, D1299DLGQ; LV2, D1280DLGQ) lesavirus 1 and lesavirus 2 form a monophyletic clade in the Picornaviridae family. these findings were well supported by phylogenetic reconstruction using the P1 (VP4321) region. this indicated that LV1 and LV2 have an evolutionary history distinct from those of other picornaviruses. s to hunniviruses and porcine teschovirus 1 were most similar to LV1 and LV2. results ranged from 39.0% to 42%, 35.0% to 36.2%, and 46.2% to 46.6%. LV1 and LV2 define a novel picornavirus genus. lemur picornaviruses are highly prevalent and species specific. we examined the epidemiology of the two novel picornaviruses in the lemur collection using longitudinally collected fecal specimens. we designed and validated a consensus-degenerate RT-PCR assay. the band corresponds to a 388-nt PCR product. phylogeny was outgrouped to an aye-aye sequence (DMU53569) individuals in mixed-species exhibit are marked with an asterisk. the prevalences of lemurs in the mixed-species exhibit in 2012 and 2013 are shown. the exhibit consisted of 4 ring-tailed lemurs (circles), 4 black-and-white ruffed lemurs (squares), and 2 black lemurs (triangles) boxes and squares representing individuals infected by LV1 (gray) and LV2 (black) are shaded. all 13 LV2-positive specimens were from black-and-white ruffed lemurs. a similar analysis was done for the VP1 of LV2 from a black-and-white ruffed lemur. ring-tailed lemur (Geo101895) that was positive for LV1 in 2012 subsequently died prior to the 2013 sampling. two of the three black-and-white ruffed lemurs that died prior to the 2013 sampling were positive for LV2 in 2012. the causes of death were different among the 5 lemurs. we first sought to identify viruses associated with lemurs by performing unbiased deep sequencing on total nucleic acid samples from fecal specimens from a subset of lemurs. the species allocation of the lemur exhibits at the time of the 2012 collection is shown. the diagram shows the complete genomes of lesavirus 1 and lesavirus 2 confirmed by RACE/RT-PCR. an analysis of 579,108 reads from a black-and-white ruffed lemur (Nai108015) identified 341 reads that assembled into 3 contigs with limited sequence identity to picornaviruses. the 3 contigs shared only 64.1% nucleotide identity with LV1 suggesting that the viral sequences in each specimen were distinct. we then examined the genomes for molecular features characteristic of picornaviruses. lesavirus 1 and lesavirus 2 define a novel genus in the family Picornaviridae. we examined the evolutionary relationship of LV1 and LV2 in the family. phylogenetic trees were constructed using a concatenated amino acid alignment of 2C and 3CD genes that included representative members from 26 picornavirus genera. ICTV guidelines for picornavirus species demarcation specify 70% amino acid identities in the P1 and 2C3CD regions. the pairwise amino acid identities of LV1 to LV2 in the P1, 2C3CD, P2, and P3 regions were 54.8%, 75.2%, 68.9%, and 72.8%, respectively. lesavirus 2 (% aa identity) P1 P2 P3 2C 3CD 2C3CD Lesavirus 1 \u201cLesavirus\u201d KM396707 7,687 46.0 54.8 68.9 72.8 76.1 74.7 75.2 Hunnivirus A1 Hunnivirus JQ941880 7,583 46.0 39.7 36.2 46.2 45.3 51.4 49.4 41.0 35.4 46.6 46.1 51.6 49.8 42.0 35 46.5 33 fecal specimens collected approximately a year later (September 2013) were evaluated. 4 lemurs (3 black-and-white ruffed lemurs and 1 ring-tailed lemur) had died. a triplet of black-and-white ruffed lemurs was born, and a black-and-white ruffed lemur was transferred to a different zoo. individuals in the mixed-species exhibit are marked with an asterisk. the prevalences of LV1 and LV2 in specimens collected in 2012 and 2013 are shown. a phylogeny inferred from the nucleotide sequences of all LV1 and LV2 strains that were screened in the experiments represented in panel C. LV1 was not detected in black lemurs, a blue-eyed black lemur, mongoose lemurs, black-and-white ruffed lemurs, or Coquerel's sifakas. a phylogenetic tree constructed with all LV1 and LV2 sequences overlaid with each host species origin confirmed that all 10 specimens that were positive for LV1 were from ring-tailed lemurs. in one single-species exhibit, a previously LV2-positive black-and-white ruffed lemur tested negative in 2013. a set of black-and-white ruffed lemur triplets born after the 2012 sampling were all positive for LV2 at the 2013 testing. in the mixed-species exhibit, 4 ring-tailed lemurs, 4 black-and-white ruffed lemurs, and 2 black lemurs together for approximately 5 months were detected. we investigated the transmission of two previously undescribed picornaviruses in lemurs at the Saint Louis Zoo. we chose lemurs because their species diverged on comparable evolutionary timescales to continental africa primates. this model is comparable to the divergence of the catarrhini parvorder of primates that includes humans, gibbons, great apes, and Old World monkeys. LV1 was detected only in ring-tailed lemurs and LV2 only in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. neither virus was detected in black lemurs, mongoose lemurs, or coquerel's sifakas. enteroviruses and parechoviruses have been found cocirculating between humans and nonhuman primates. black-and-white ruffed lemur triplets born after the initial sampling were found positive for LV2 in 2013. the test results from the dam (Lul105694) of the triplets were negative at both time points, suggesting that the infections were the result of horizontal transmission. the host range of these picornaviruses remains to be experimentally determined. the 2C3CD comparison of LPV1 and LPV2 falls within the species guidelines. the P1 region identity is lower than the 70% cutoff. we propose that LV1 and LV2 should be classified within a novel genus."}
