{"summary": "the recently developed loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) method is relatively simple and can be improved for better use in endemic countries. the realAmp method was found to be simple and allowed real-time detection of DNA amplification. microscopy and RDTs remain the only feasible options for malaria detection in many endemic countries. current RDTs detect parasite antigens such as histidine rich protein (HRP) -2, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and aldolase using immunochromatographic methods. the current PCR-based methods are beyond the capacity of most malaria-endemic countries because they require sophisticated laboratory infrastructure and training. however, more sensitive diagnostic tools will be required in order to detect asymptomatic low level parasitemia. sensitivity and specificity of LAMP was reported to be 95% and 99% respectively compared to an in-house nested PCR. sensitivity and specificity of LAMP was reported to be 95% and 99% respectively compared to an in-house nested PCR. the limit of detection for P. vivax was shown to be 30 parasites per microliter (p/L) [13] with 100% specificity and 98.3% sensitivity compared to microscopy. however, there is a need for a simple field-usable method that can afford a quicker and objective readout for the diagnosis of malaria using the LAMP method. amplification platform (heating block) and fluorescent detection unit for end point use are combined into a single unit for LAMP assay. we demonstrate the utility of this method for the diagnosis of malaria by using published Plasmodium genus specific primers and comparing it to microscopy and a nested PCR method. the tube scanner is connected to a computer with the appropriate software. the results are obtained in real-time as shown in B. ninety four samples confirmed to be P. falciparum positive by microscopy obtained from a human clinical trial. 12 samples known to be negative for P. falciparum were used to assess the efficacy of anti-malarial drugs. mM MgCl2, 200 M dNTPs, 200 nM primers, and 1.25 units of Taq polymerase were analyzed using gel electrophoresis (2% gel) to visualize bands of appropriate size. realAmp method was performed using the commercially available Loopamp DNA amplification kit (Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tokyo, Japan) orescence units in milli-volts (mV) and the X-axis shows the time in minutes. the control tube (no DNA) had no measurable fluorescence indicated by a flat line in the plot. sensitivity and specificity of realAmp method was calculated using both microscopy and a nested PCR assay. the tube scanner can hold 8,200 L PCR tubes and is equipped with an LCD panel. the results are obtained in real-time as shown in B. DNA from these four species was diluted from 40,000 p/L or 10,000 p/L to 1 p/L. ninety four samples confirmed to be P. falciparum positive by microscopy obtained from a human clinical trial. 12 samples known to be negative for P. falciparum were used as a control. Nested PCR Nested PCR was performed with primers and cycling conditions as described by Singh et al. [18] with some modifications. PCR amplified material was analyzed using gel electrophoresis (2% gel) amplification was carried out at 63\u00b0C for 90 minutes using the realAmp method. in the plot, the Y-axis denotes the fluorescence units in milli-volts (mV) and the X-axis shows the time in minutes. the control tube (no DNA) had no measurable fluorescence indicated by a flat line in the plot. amplification curves were observed for all the four species within 20 minutes. no amplification was seen with malaria-free human DNA (Human) or in the no template control (NTC) lowest conc. detected (p/L) P. falciparum P. malariae P. ovale P. vivax Run # 1 10 1 1 10 Run # 2 100 10 1 10 Run # 3 10 Not tested 10 Sensitivity and specificity of the RealAmp method compared to microscopy and nested PCR. the realAmp method was able to amplify up to 40p/L of P. falciparum from heat-treated samples and occasionally up to 4 p/L. there was no consistent amplification below 40 p/L especially with heat treated DNA. no amplification was detected with heat-treated uninfected whole blood. Nested PCR 3,000\u20138000* 3.67 RealAmp using an in-house buffer 6, 344# 2.66 RealAmp using a commercial buffer Same as above 5.05 2 *Refers to the cost of buying the equipment as listed by various major suppliers in the USA. **Cost includes all the necessary reagents and consumables; it does not include personnel cost. Detection of different human malaria parasites We were able to amplify any of the four species of human the DNA was diluted from 40,000 p/L (P. falciparum) or 10,000 p/L to 1 p/L. this assay required at least 1\u201310 p/L for the detection of P. ovale and P. malariae. nested PCR detected up to 1 p/L for all the four species. the realAmp method showed 98.9% (95% CI: 93.1\u201399.9%) sensitivity and 100% (95% CI: 100%) specificity when compared to nested PCR. the realAmp method was able to amplify up to 40p/L of P. falciparum from heat-treated samples and occasionally up to 4 p/L. cost analysis of the realAmp method compared to the nested PCR. the cost of performing realAmp was lower when an in-house buffer was used. however, the cost of realAmp increased when a commercially available buffer was used. results from the realAmp method were comparable to previously reported malaria LAMP assays [13]\u2013[17]. the reported sensitivities and specificities ranged from 73.1% to 98.3% and 85.7% to 100%, respectively, using microscopy as a reference standard. the realAmp method was evaluated using only Plasmodium genus specific primers. it can be used as a confirmatory test for malaria infection in place of a standard PCR assay. the realAmp method was not designed for the quantitation of parasitemia. the time to amplification was shorter for samples with high parasite densities than for samples with low parasite densities. the heat-treatment method yielded DNA extract that could be used to reliably detect as low as 40 p/L. the realAmp method is technically easier to perform than the nested PCR. the tube scanner is comparable to the real-time turbidimeter used in some studies. the tubidimeter measures the turbidity of reaction mixture while the realAmp measures the fluorescence units generated as the product is formed. the realAmp method can be performed with any alternative equipment that is similar to the tube scanner used in the study. the utility of any diagnostic assay for point-of-care and field use will lie, among other things, on the fact that it is less expensive and simple to perform."}
