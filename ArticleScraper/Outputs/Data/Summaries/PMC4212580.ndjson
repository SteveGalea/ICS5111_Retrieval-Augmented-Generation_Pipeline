{"summary": "the yeast two-hybrid system, pulldown assays using recombinant protein, as well as tandem affinity purification or TAP-tagging1. a more recent addition to these techniques is the combination of affinity purification of a protein of interest from a relevant mammalian cell line, followed by quantitative mass spectrometry using stable isotope labeling of amino acids. eIF4AI and II immunoprecipitations allowed reproducible and confident identification of the primary binding partner eIF4G (isoforms I/II and III)5. SILAC immunoprecipitation enables the identification of direct interactions but also low affinity or indirect interactions with protein complexes4. transfection of labeled cells with pEGFP-fusion Constructs Remove the media from the cells and replace it with 9 ml of antibiotic-free SILAC DMEM (Light, Medium or Heavy) media. the expression of a protein of interest results in any apparent toxicity. it may be necessary to reduce the amount of plasmid transfected or the duration of the subsequent expression period. a 50 l aliquot of the sample should be retained as the sample input and the lysate kept on ice while preparing anti-GFP beads. Typically yields vary between 1-3.5 mg of protein in the final 1 ml sample. ation of samples for MS Analysis Centrifuge samples at 2,700 x g, 4 \u00b0C for 5 min. 50 l of the supernatant should be retained as the unbound sample. 1ml dilution buffer should be added to each tube. data should always include an accession number for each protein identified, ratio\u2019s comparing each sample ratio (light vs medium, light vs heavy, medium vs heavy etc), the number of unique peptides identified, and some form of false positive rate or confidence indication. the data should fit a Gaussian distribution centered around a log2 SILAC ratio of 0. Create new columns in the excel file and calculate log2 SILAC ratios for all the sample/mock columns. for conversion of a mock/sample ratio to a sample/mock ratio, use the formula: \u201c=1/ratio\u201d 7. 1.96 standard deviations would place a threshold at the 95% confidence limit (p0.05) 2.58 SD would give 99%, and 3.3 SD 99.9%. the threshold should be determined individually for each replica experiment. vlookup will not obtain all the required names from one experiment. select each ratio column individually and click on the Home tab. select style \u2018Classic\u2019. Format only cells that contain \u2018Cell value\u2019, \u2018Greater than or Equal to\u2019. aliquot of arginine and lysine to 500 ml bottle of Arg/Lys free DMEM. add 50 ml of dialyzed FBS and 5 ml of penicillin/streptomycin to 500 ml bottle. HEK 293T cells should be maintained in DMEM media lacking arginine and lysine. the appropriate plasmid (epEGFP-C1, pEGFP-eIF4A-I, pEGFP-eIF4A-I, pEGFP-eIF4A-II) in 500 l of antibiotic-free SILAC DMEM containing 10 l of transfection reagent (e.g., lipofectamine 2000) mix thoroughly by pipetting it up and down several times. centrifuge samples at 13,000 x g, 4 \u00b0C for 10 min retain the supernatant as the cell lysate. the concentration of the cell lysate should be assessed by BCA assay according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. slurry, add 20 volumes (1,500 l per 75 l slurry) of dilution buffer. add 100 l dilution buffer per 25 l bead slurry. transfer 85 l of this resuspended slurry to each of the samples. data should always include an accession number for each protein identified, ratio\u2019s comparing each sample ratio (light vs medium, light vs heavy, medium vs heavy etc), the number of unique peptides identified and some form of false positive rate or confidence indication. a SILAC ratio results in any data for proteins showing a decrease in abundance being restricted to values between 0 and 1. the data should fit a Gaussian distribution centered around a log2 SILAC ratio of 0. Create new columns in the excel file. in the \u2018Results\u2019 folder a new \u2018Histogram\u2019 section will have been generated. select the frequency distribution section and select new analysis>XY>Nonlinear regression (curve fit) click on \u2018Gaussian distribution\u2019 and click OK. vlookup formula is: \u201c=vlookup(AccessionNo, WheretoLook, ColumnsAccross, False)\u201d where: AccessionNo is $aX with X being the row number. ColumnsAccross is the number of columns across from the accession number in column A a desired value lies. in a typical SILAC pulldown experiment, the vast majority of identified proteins represent contaminants as well as proteins binding non-specifically to the affinity matrix. this is illustrated in Figure 2B, even when washing protocols remove a majority of cytoplasmic contaminants such as GAPDH (Figure 2A) the highest ratios were observed with eIF4G, which binds directly to eIF4A, with lower ratios for eIF4E, which binds to eIF4G at a site away from the eIF4A-binding site. lower ratios were observed for members of the eIF3 complex. eIF4AI \u2018Bait\u2019 protein Q14240 22 0.01 90.855 eIF4AII G5E9S1 25 47.575 30.53 eIF4GI Interacting proteins Q59GJ0 5 11.778 10.619 eIF4GII P06730 3 7.22 7.57 eIF4E Q5T6W5 4 0.685 0.646 hnRNPK Non-specifically binding contaminants P62805 1 0.531 plasmids encoding GFP (Mock) or GFP fusion proteins are immunoprecipitated from cell lysates. samples are combined in a 1:1 ratio and submitted for LC-MS/MS analysis. data is then analyzed to remove low confidence protein identifications. protein shaded from red to white according to log2 SILAC ratio in the SILAC IP. red is the most abundant protein in the analysis. white is the 1.96 SD cutoff. a nuclease may be included or omitted from this protocol according to the specifics of a particular experiment. in some cases, there could be benefit from running parallel experiments with and without nuclease to identify nucleic acid dependent interactions. alternative control involves the sequential switching of all three (\u2018light\u2019, \u2018medium\u2019, and \u2018heavy\u2019) media in replicate experiments. the technique involves mixing differently labeled samples at the end of the immunoprecipitation process. this is done as protein:protein interactions occur at a given equilibrium15. it should be noted that other groups have combined this MAP SILAC approach with incubation of the samples prior to pulldown. yeast 2-hybrid, GST/His or TAP Pulldowns are used in identifying novel protein-interactions."}
