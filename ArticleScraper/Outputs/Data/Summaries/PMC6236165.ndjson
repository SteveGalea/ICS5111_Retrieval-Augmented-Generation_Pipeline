{"summary": "retrospective study aimed to investigate the computed tomography (CT) manifestations, short-term dynamic evolution features and quantitative lung CT analysis. the quantitative CT indicators included lung injury CT score (LICTS), lung fibrosis CT score (LFCTS), mean lung density (MLD) and reductively aerated volume ratio (RAVR) inhalation lung injury induced by smoke bombs are predominantly GGOs and consolidation. they aggravate in the early stage and gradual dissolute in the later stage. CT quantitative values can contribute to assessing the extent of this disease. most children developed vomiting, chest distress, shortness of breath, dyspnea, asphyxia, coma, hemoptysis, hemafecia and other symptoms. findings might help in treating smoke bomb poisoning, improving prognosis, and especially benefiting children in a war area. sensitivity of CT in finding the abnormalities of inhalation lung injury is higher than that of the chest radiograph (10). sensitivity of CT in finding the abnormalities of inhalation lung injury is higher than that of the chest radiograph (10). each lung was divided into three zones: upper (above the carina), middle (below carina up to the inferior pulmonary vein) and lower (below the inferior pulmonary vein) each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement based on band scores. areas (900 to 801 HU), restricted ventilation areas (700 HU) were defined by the software for each of the lungs. the software also generated the total lung volume and mean lung density (MLD) changes in LICTS (A), LFCTS (B), MLD (C), NAVR (D) and RAVR (E) from the time of the initial scan to the follow-up. the 11 pediatric patients treated in Gansu Provincial Hospital were transferred from the local hospital in Tianshui city. the predominant patterns of early stage on CT scan were categorized as ground-glass opacities (GGOs), consolidation, reticular pattern, and mixed pattern (combination of consolidation, and reticular opacities) each lung was divided into three zones: upper (above the carina), middle (above the carina), middle (above the carina), middle (above the carina), middle (above the carina), middle (above the carina), each zone was evaluated for percentage of lung involvement based on the following band scores: (I) 0 score: normal; (II) 1 score: involvement of less than 25% of the images; (III) 2 score: 25% to 50%; (IV) 3 score: 50% to 75%;(4) 4 score: more than 75%. the integrated lung quantification software of AW 4.4 workstation was used to measure the lung volume to evaluate the pulmonary function. indicator 1 (Sep 22nd) 2 (Sep 24th) 3 (Oct 1st) 4 (Oct 8th) 5 (Oct 15th) LICTS 20.111.51 20.451.81 14.555.37 7.002.32 1.091.04 LFCTS \u2013 2.451.21 9.642.84 6.822.23 MLD 640.9140.27 640.1968.15 693.4573.40 720.2035 all the patients were classified as'severe' in the local hospital. most had vomiting (n=11), chest distress (n=11), shortness of breath (n=11), dyspnea (n=11), asphyxia (n=3), hemoptysis (n=2) and hemafecia (n=4). the patient with the most severe condition was treated with endotracheal intubation and pneumothorax drain. the extent decreased slowly to a median of LICTS of 14 (range, 7\u201322) from the 3rd CT images (1st, Oct) and 6 (range, 4\u201310) from the 4th CT images (8th, Oct), and 1 (range, 0\u20133) from the last CT images (15th, Oct) the final CT scan was obtained on the 28th day (15th, Oct) it was noted that lung fibrosis significantly improved. the median of LFCTS of these three CT scans (1st, 8th and 15th, Oct) were 3 (range, 0\u20134), 9 (range, 6\u201314) and 6 (range, 3\u201312) respectively. the 2nd CT scan (A) in a patient shows pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax (white arrowhead) (A,B), and reticular patterns (oval) with excessive GGOs (B). LICTS positively correlates with MLD (r=0.811, P=0.000), but negatively correlates with NVAR (r=0.712, P=0.000); LFCTS positively correlates with RAVR (r= all the patients were given timely oxygen therapy, anti-inflammatory, and other treatments in the local hospital after the accident. only one patient with the worst condition had increased white blood cells [12.745109/L (normal range, 4109\u201310109/L)] the patient with the most severe condition was treated with endotracheal intubation and pneumothorax drain. the extent decreased slowly to a median of LICTS of 14 (range, 7\u201322) from the 3rd CT images (1st, Oct) and 6 (range, 4\u201310) from the 4th CT images (8th, Oct), and 1 (range, 0\u20133) from the last CT images (15th, Oct) the final CT scan was obtained on the 28th day (15th, Oct) it was noted that lung fibrosis significantly improved. the median of LFCTS of these three CT scans (1st, 8th and 15th, Oct) were 3 (range, 0\u20134), 9 (range, 6\u201314) and 6 (range, 3\u201312) respectively. the 2nd CT scan in a patient shows pneumomediastinum, subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax (white arrowhead) (A,B), and reticular patterns (oval) with excessive GGOs (B). LICTS positively correlates with MLD (r=0.811, P=0.000), but negatively correlates with NVAR (r=0.712, P=0.000); LFCTS positively correlates with RAVR (r=0.382, scans depicted lung abnormalities at specific time points after the accident. this is the first report of a longitudinal CT series in a relatively large group of pediatric patients with inhalation lung injury induced by smoke bombs. image findings were based on histological characteristics, including pulmonary edema, alveolitis, interstitial fibrosis, intra-alveolar fibrosis and diffuse alveolar damage. the number of pediatric patients with GGOs was highest in the 1st week (10 out of 11 pediatric patients), which decreased in the following one week and had a moderate upsurge trend in the 3rd week. the results were similar to the CT images and prognosis of lobar pneumonia. LICTS positively correlated with MLD (r=0.811, P=0.000), while negatively correlated with NVAR (r=0.712, P=0.000). lung fibrosis was detected from the latter three CT scans. it usually caused a restrictive ventilation disorder. it was therefore hypothesized that there may be a relationship between RAVR and LFCTS. the earlier detection of lung fibrosis was and the earlier anti-fibrosis treatment was given, the better the prognosis would be. this study showed that the earlier detection of lung fibrosis was and the earlier anti-fibrosis treatment was given, the better the prognosis would be."}
