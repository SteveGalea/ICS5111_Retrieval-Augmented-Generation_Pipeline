BS6K protein sequence shows 58.9, 91.5, 94.5, and 85.9% similarity with p38 homolog. a hundred percent conserved amino acids are shaded in black. activation loop is underlined, ED site is shown by inverted triangles. phylogenetic tree of BmS6K is shown with yellow color triangle. phylogenetic tree was constructed by neighbor-joining method from p38 and S6K. Bmp38 was closely related to Chilo suppressalis and D. plexippus. BmS6K protein showed close relationship with S. litura and P. rapae. expressions were upregulated in resistant strain of silkworm BC9. the recombinant proteins (Bmp38 and BmS6K) were expressed using prokaryotic expression system. the recombinant proteins were purified under denaturing conditions. the titer of antibody was 1:60,000 approximately. different tissues including hemolymph, fat body, integument, head, midgut, and silk gland were collected for P50 and BC9 at 72 h after BmNPV challenge. western blot results also showed that Bmp38 expression was relatively higher in the midgut, hemolymph, and body. expression was also observed in every tissue examined, with the highest expression level in the hemolymph and midgut. the lowest expression was observed in the silk gland. expression level was downregulated in the head after BmNPV infection. the significant difference was indicated by *P 0.05 or **P 0.01. immunoblotting results of Bmp38 (B) and BmS6K (D) in the midgut of different resistant silkworm strains following BmNPV infection. relative copy number of viral genes was significantly upregulated than CK. preimmune serum and CK were used as control. data were normalized using BmGAPDH. BmNPV proliferation was significantly slower in resistant BC9. the relative copy number increased from 6.5 to 2,216.2 within 6\u201348 hpi. these results indicated that viral proliferation was faster in midgut oral than in midgut injected. no UTR was found in BmS6K amino acid sequence. two S_TKc domains along with extension to Ser/Thr-type protein kinases domain (S_TK_x) were predicted in BmS6K amino acid sequence. alignment of Bmp38 with other known organisms p38 homolog. a hundred percent conserved amino acids are shaded in black. activation loop underlined, ED site shown by inverted triangles. phylogenetic tree of BmS6K was constructed from p38 and S6K proteins of different species. phylogenetic tree of BmS6K can be classified into vertebrates and invertebrates. expressed proteins in different strains P50 (susceptible strain) and BC9 (resistant strain) according to iTRAQ database, Bmp38 and BmS6K expressions were upregulated in resistant strain of silkworm BC9. expression of both proteins was upregulated in resistant strain of iTRAQ. western blot analysis of recombinant proteins identified by anti-His antibodies. titer of antibody was 1:60,000 approximately as per ELISA determination. titer of antibody was 1:60,000 approximately as per ELISA determination. west blot results also showed that Bmp38 expression was relatively higher in the midgut, hemolymph, and fat body. however, no obvious hybrid band for Bmp38 was detected in the integument according to western blotting. expression level of BmS6K was downregulated in the head after BmNPV infection. the translation data confirmed that BC9 had higher expression than P50 in the fat body after BmNPV infection. expression profile of Bmp38 and BmS6K in the midgut infected with BmNPV was compared with control group. in case of BmS6K, expression was upregulated in infected group (P50+ and BC9+) than control group (P50 and BC9) expression was slightly increased at 6 h, then dramatically increased at 12, 24, 48, and 72 h than P50 after BmNPV infection. western blot analysis also confirmed that the expression of BmS6K was upregulated after BmNPV infection. the significant difference was indicated by *P 0.05 or **P 0.01. Discussion MAPK signaling pathways are evolutionarily conserved Ser\u2013Thr kinases with a wide range of biological functions. p38 MAPK and S6K are important proteins of MAPK family. p38 MAPK participates in host defense and protect Drosophila form injury caused by pathogens. studies have shown that p38 MAPK participates in viral replication in in vito. expression in different silkworm strains showed that Bmp38 expression was upregulated in the BC9 than in the P50. findings suggest that Bmp38 may be involved in immune response against BmNPV. study suggests disruption of S6K causes death of flies at larvae and pupa stage. members of RSK family contained RSK1, RSK2, RSK3 and RSK4. activation of PI3K/Akt/mTOR could phosphorylate S6K to further activate downstream signal pathways in response to viral infection."}
