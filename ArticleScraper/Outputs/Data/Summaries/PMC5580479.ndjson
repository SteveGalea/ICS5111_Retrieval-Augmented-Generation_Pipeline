{"summary": "the ubiquitin proteasome system (UPS) constitutes the main non-lysosomal intracellular protein degradation pathway that comprises three major components. the proteasome holoenzymes, a number of ubiquitin ligases and a broad variety of deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) the ubiquitin molecule is activated by an E1 ligase followed by the transfer to one of numerous conjugating enzymes. a number of virus-encoded DUBs have been identified in various virus families. certain viruses use DUB activity to evade host antiviral immune response. some viruses up-regulate the activity of DUBs, which is beneficial for their replication capacity. the role of the UPS in retrovirus replication remains enigmatic. a virally encoded DUB interferes with the replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-Coronavirus [21], but the function of the UPS remains enigmatic. ubiquitin ligases regulate the transport of Gag molecules to the cell surface. proteasome inhibitors interfere with late processes of HIV-replication. the HIV-1 Gag polyprotein Pr55 is necessary and sufficient for generation of virus-like particles. combined treatment of human lymphoid aggregate cultures revealed strong synergistic antiretroviral activity. we demonstrate that DIs lead to the accumulation of polyubiquitinated Gag species and thus cause enhanced entry of Gag into the MHC-I pathway. we suggest that DIs might offer a novel option in antiretroviral therapy as they interfere with virus spread. dodecyl sulfate (SDS), 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) containing protease inhibitor cocktail Complete (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), 5 mM N-ethylmaleimide (NEM), and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonylfluoride (PMSF) expression plasmids encoding a codon optimized synthetic Gag polyprotein (sy cells were infected with cell culture supernatant containing HIV-14lig7. supernatant was harvested and passed through a 0.45 m pore-size filter. p24 ELISA normalized for p24, as quantified by p24. 2.6.

Infection of HLA cultures, 2 106 cells were incubated overnight with virus preparations equivalent to 1 ng of p24. cell culture supernatant was collected every second or third day post infection. HEK293T cells were maintained in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin. all cell culture media and reagents were purchased from Gibco (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) expression plasmids encoding a codon optimized synthetic Gag polyprotein (syngag) have been described elsewhere. the construct containing the ovalbumin-derived model epitope SIINFEKL (SL) in its p2 spacer region, syngag-SL, has been previously described. a mutational inactivation of the viral protease (PR) has been described elsewhere. HLACs were cultured in RPMI Media 1640 supplemented with 15% (v/v) inactivated FCS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin, 2.5 g/mL Fungizone, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1% (v/v) Eagles minimum essential medium (MEM) non-essential amino acid and 50 g/mL gent in vitro processing was performed using 2.56 M Recombinant HIV1 Protease Protein (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) for 9 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were detached and washed twice in ice cold PBS and lysed in RIPA buffer. anti-mouse and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies coupled to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were obtained from Dianova (Hamburg, Germany). HA-tagged ubiquitin was visualized using an HA-reactive monoclonal antibody (mAb) directly conjugated to HRP (Roche). cells were incubated with hybridoma cell culture supernatant containing the mAb B8-24-3 [57], followed by staining with secondary Alexa 647-conjugated anti-mouse Ab. cells were seeded in 96-well plates and infected the next day with 1 ng vesicular stomatitis virus-glycoprotein (VSV-G)-pseudotyped virions standardized for determination of the Replication Capacity Virus replication was assessed by quantification of the virus-associated reverse transcriptase activity by [32P]-thymidine triphosphate (TTP) incorporation. the respective replication profiles were depicted as diagram (y-axis: RT activity; x-axis: dpi) in each experiment the replication capacity of the untreated wt was set to 100%. western blot analyses of whole cell lysates and VLP fractions showed a defect in Gag processing without affecting virus-like particle (VLP) release. treatment with P22077 or PR-619 led to an overall defect in Gag processing with prominent accumulation of the Pr55 Gag precursor protein. rate of Gag processing was calculated as the amount of p24 relative to the total amount of Gag detected in cell and VLP fractions. values on the y-axis were adjusted to 100% for the untreated control. one explanation for the defect in Gag processing would be direct inhibition of the HIV-1 PR by the DIs PR-619 or P22077. ted for 9 h with 2.56 M of HIV-1 PR and 20 M P22077 or PR-619. treatment with 10 M Nelfinavir or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) served as positive or solvent controls. treatment with 10 M Nelfinavir or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) served as positive or solvent controls. TZM-bl cells were infected with 1 ng of p24 equivalent derived from purified VSV-G pseudotyped pNLenv1 VLPs. TZM-bl cells were infected with either T-cell (X4)- or macrophage (R5)-tropic HIV-1NL4-3 standardized for equal amounts of p24. 2.5 M, 5 M, or 10 M PR-619 and structured (D) or permanent (E) treatment of HLAC with 3.75 M, 7.5 M, or 15 M P22077. uninfected HLAC served as negative control. permanent treatment with the DIs PR-619 and P22077 interfered with virus replication in a dose-dependent manner. the highest inhibitor concentrations of 10 M PR-619 or 15 M P22077 almost completely blocked the replication capacity of X4- and R5-tropic viruses. however, the USP7-specific DI P5091, which had no impact on Gag processing efficiency, did not reduce virus replication. to exclude unspecific effects of P22077 and PR-619 on cell viability, water-soluble tetrazolium salt (WST)-1 assays were performed. HLAC were infected with X4- and R5-tropic virus (1ng p24) treated with 2.5 M, 5 M, or 10 M PR-619 or 3.75 M, 7.5 M, or 15 M P22077 respectively. untreated, HIV-1NL4-3 infected cells were set to 100%. structured and permanent treatment with 2.5 M, 5 M, or 10 M PR-619 or 3.75 M, 7.5 M, or 15 M P22077 respectively, was performed. the replication capacity of untreated HIV-14lig7 in each experiment was set to 100%. bars represent the mean values of 3 independent experiments SD. HLAC were infected with HIV-1NL4-3 (1 ng p24), followed by permanent treatment with indicated amounts of PR-619 or P22077 alone or together with 0.6 nM Bortezomib or 10 nM PR-957, respectively. HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) and syngag expression plasmids. the PTAP mutant was assessed in parallel [25,30] to avoid proteasomal degradation of polyubiquitinated Gag species. gag was immunoprecipitated from whole cell lysates using anti-HIV antibodies. the amount of precipitated Gag was detected by western blot stained for HA. mAb 25D1.16-APC stained intracellular Gag with anti-Gag Ab KC57-FITC. bars represent mean values of 3 independent experiments SD. cells devoid of H2-Kb served as negative control. western blot analyses of whole cell lysates and VLP fractions revealed that treatment with P22077 or PR-619 led to an overall defect in Gag processing. however, addition of the DI P5091, which is selective for USP7, had no influence on Gag processing. total cell lysates and VLP fractions were analyzed by western blotting using an anti-capsid (CA) antibody. bars represent mean values of 4 independent experiments SD. one explanation for defect in Gag processing would be direct inhibition of the HIV-1 PR by the DIs PR-619 or P22077. Pr55 Gag was obtained from released VLPs and incubated for 9 h with 2.56 M of HIV-1 PR and 20 M P22077 or PR-619. treatment with 10 M Nelfinavir or dimethyl sulfoxide served as positive or solvent controls. treatment with 15 M or 20 M P22077 or PR-619 reduced virus infectivity. TZM-bl cells were infected with 1 ng of p24 equivalent derived from purified VSV-G pseudotyped pNLenv1 VLPs. infectious titers were determined by measuring the -galactosidase activity. NL4-3 (X4) is shown with structured (B) or permanent (C) treatment of HLAC with 2.5 M, 5 M, or 10 M PR-619 and structured (D) or permanent (E) treatment of HLAC with 3.75 M, 7.5 M, or 15 M P22077 following infection with HIV-1NL4-3 (1ng p24). Irrespective of treatment schemes, the highest inhibitor concentrations of 10 M PR-619 or 15 M P22077 almost completely blocked the replication capacity of X4- and R5-tropic viruses. in contrast, the USP7-specific DI P5091, which had no impact on Gag processing efficiency, did not reduce virus replication. bars represent the mean values of 8 independent experiments SD. HLAC were infected with X4- and R5-tropic virus (1ng p24), followed by structured and permanent treatment with 2.5 M, 5 M, or 10 M PR-619 or 3.75 M, 7.5 M, or 15 M P22077 respectively. cell culture supernatant was collected on the indicated days post infection. the replication capacity of untreated HIV-14lig7 was assessed by calculating the AUC of each individual replication profile. HLAC were infected with HIV-1NL4-3 (1 ng p24), followed by permanent treatment with indicated amounts of PR-619 or P22077 alone. the replication capacity of untreated HIV-1NL4-3 in each experiment was set to 100%. HeLa cells were co-transfected with HA-tagged ubiquitin (HA-Ub) and syngag expression plasmids, and treated for 12 h with indicated concentrations of DIs. PTAP mutant showed elevated levels of ubiquitinated Gag. transfection cells were treated with 14 M PR-619 or 20 M P22077 for 12 h. the amount of precipitated Gag was detected by western blot stained for HA. the amount of precipitated Gag was detected by anti-CA staining. new tab DIs P22077 and PR-619 increase antigen presentation of Gag-derived epitopes. intracellular Gag was stained with anti-Gag Ab KC57-FITC. mutation of the PTAP-motif within p6 causes enhanced ubiquitination of Gag due to its prolonged membrane association. this process has been ascribed to the interaction of Gag with a complex consisting of CCDC8, Obsl1, and the E3 ligase Cul7 at the plasma membrane. mutation of these motifs leads to a prolonged membrane association of Gag and thus an enhanced entry into the UPS and MHC-I pathway. ESCRT-III interacting DUB AMSH can inhibit viral particle production, while AMSH knockdown did not influence virus release. selective DIs have become available and facilitate the investigation of the role of DUBs in viral replication. some of these DIs allow selective targeting of just one of the 90 known DUBs which might be one explanation for their relatively low toxicity. a complete and comprehensive block in the production of progeny viruses must have been achieved by DI treatment that efficiently enables eradication of virus replication. we could show that the addition of the DIs leads to an accumulation of polyubiquitinated Gag species, which interfere with Gag-processing in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. si et al. have previously shown that DIs boost the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors on Coxsackie virus replication. but in this case DIs alone had no effect on replication of Coxsackie virus. there was no supra-additive effect detectable, even when both inhibitors were added at high concentration levels. the HIV-1 Gag protein is a bona fide substrate for the DRiP-pathway [94] and proteasome inhibitors lead to an accumulation of DRiPs [38]. in vitro processing assays revealed that the applied DIs sterically disturb the highly ordered lattice of assembling Gag and exert a negative effect on the viral protease. a possible explanation for this observation might be that just a minor fraction of Gag enters the UPS following treatment with DIs. this does not reduce the overall level of Gag that remains non-ubiquitinated."}
