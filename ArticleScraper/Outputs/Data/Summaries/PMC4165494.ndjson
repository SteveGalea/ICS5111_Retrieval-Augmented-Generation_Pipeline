{"summary": "critical pertussis is characterized by severe respiratory failure, important leukocytosis, pulmonary hypertension, septic shock and encephalopathy. despite advances in life support and the treatment of organ failure in childhood critical illness, critical pertussis remains difficult to treat. a new resurgence was seen in 2013 in the presence on a high (98%) coverage of childhood vaccination. the purpose of this study was to describe the institutional experience in the management of infants with CP admitted in year 2013 at Children\u2019s hospital bechir Hamza of Tunis. s, B. bronchiseptica, and B. holmesii; the IS1001 specific of B. parapertussis; and the recA gene-specific of B. holmesii. tracheal sampling for viral detection through RT-PCR were performed in all infants. the hospital has 360 beds, and the PICU has 16 beds (500 admissions/year) data collection Since 2009, real-time reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for detection of Bordetella pertussis was performed on nasopharyngeal and/or tracheal secretions for all patients admitted with suspected pertussis or bronchioltis. the presence of complications and coinfections with viral or bacterial pathogens was evaluated at the time of PICU admission. all therapeutic interventions, including duration of respiratory or circulatory support with or without sedation, muscle paralysis, inhalation of nitric oxide were recorded. 1 0 Co-morbidity, n (%) 7(41) 6(46) 1(25) Premature 5(29) 4(30) 1(25) Small for gestational age at birth 1(6) 1(8) 0 Immunization, n (%) fever 7(41) 4(30) 3(75) Cough started relative to PICU admission: 1 wk prior 5(29) 4(30) 1(25) 1\u20132 wk prior 4(23) 3 eight patients (53%) had viral coinfection with Rhinovirus in 7 cases and with Rhinovirus and Coronavirus in only one case. two among 4 deaths had coinfection with rhinovirus. ourocomial infection in 5 patients and femoral venous thrombosis post catheterization in one case. time of death ranged from 1 to 30 days after admission. death was attributed to refractory shock in 3 cases and cerebral death in 1 case. the mortality rate in pertussis was 31%. infants dying of pertussis suffered from pneumonia, circulatory failure, encephalopathy, and multiple organ system failure. despite advances in life support, pertussis remains difficult to treat. a death for septic shock was related to untreated bacterial co-infection. it is possible that ECMO could have improved prognosis of children with refractory septic shock."}
