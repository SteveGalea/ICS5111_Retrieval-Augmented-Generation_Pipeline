{"summary": "the purpose of this study was to model early recovery of physical function in patients undergoing total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty. the study was to model early recovery of physical function in patients undergoing total hip (THA) and knee (TKA) arthroplasty. the study has contributed further evidence to highlight the benefit of using physical performance measures to learn about the patients' actual level of disability. there is no consensus on the best outcome measures to monitor recovery following arthroplasty. the physical function subscale of the WOMAC has failed to detect changes in physical function that were evident with performance assessment [13,14]. the results suggest that self-report measures comment more on a patient's experience of moving around whereas performance specific measures may better represent the ability to move around. patients undergoing TKA were allowed to be full weight bearing and participated in a progressive program of range of motion, strengthening exercises, proprioceptive exercises and functional training. most of the patients were transferred from the acute care floor to the onsite short-term rehabilitation unit to continue to progress the aforementioned programs for a maximum length of stay of 7 days. canceled surgery, loss of follow-up due to the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in Toronto from April to June 2003, additional operative procedures, postoperative medical reasons or patient choice to discontinue. thousands of people, mostly in the Toronto area were quarantined for 10 day periods. the 6 MWT [7,19-22], TUG [23-26] and the ST [11,26,27] were chosen. the WOMAC is considered one of the leading health status measures in the arthroplasty population. the WOMAC is considered one of the leading health status measures. patients completed the physical function subscale of the WOMAC version LK3.1. the physical function subscale has 17 items, which are scored on a scale of 0 to 4. the LEFS has the opposite orientation to the WOMAC with higher total LEFS' scores. a mixed effects approach is used in which some parameters have both fixed and random effects. the fixed effect parameters describe the average change in the population of interest and the random effects describe the individual differences. the baseline preoperative scores of the outcome measure being modeled were used one at a time, sequentially. if a predictor was added, initially its effect on the average overall score (i.e. the intercept) was evaluated and this was followed by an examination of its interactions with time to test the predictor's effects on the rate of recovery. 66% of patients post THA had weight bearing restrictions. most of the patients were transferred from acute care floor to short-term rehabilitation unit. follow-up assessments were not conducted at exactly the same time points. thousands of people, mostly in the area, were quarantined for 10 days. there were significant restrictions on patient related activities in hospitals. the 6 MWT [7,19-22], TUG [23-. two self-report measures of functional status were selected. the physical function subscale of the WOMAC and the LEFS were also selected. the WOMAC has been considered one of the leading health status measures in the arthroplasty population. patients completed the physical function subscale of the WOMAC version LK3.1. the physical function subscale has 17 items, which are scored on a scale of 0 to 4. the items are summed to produce a total LEFS score, which can vary from 0 to 80. a natural logarithmic transformation of the TUG scores was required to correct the positive skew of the data. the basic model of change in physical function over time includes parameters that estimate the patients' self-reported or actual measured function at one week post surgery. the model also includes the square of time as a predictor to estimate the change in the recovery rate for each week after one week. if a predictor had a significant fixed and/or interaction effect, these term(s) would be retained in the model at which point the next predictor would be evaluated. the final multivariate model was determined once all of the predictors had been explored. plots of the predicted scores for each measure were plotted against the actual scores with a linear distribution indicating good fit. 69 of the 152 subjects who participated underwent THA and 83 TKA. 69 of the subjects underwent THA and 83 TKA. the graphs were constructed from the measure scores predicted by each of the final developed models. lower scores represent improvement for the WOMAC PF scores, the TUG and the ST with the reverse orientation for the 6 MWT and LEFS. different patterns of recovery were observed between self-report measures of physical function and performance measures. figure 2 shows a ceiling effect (lower scores are better) for the TUG measure around nine to ten weeks. similar patterns of recovery are observed for the participants post THA and TKA with respect to the recovery figures for the WOMAC physical function scores and the LEFS. site of arthroplasty with rate

squared) provided a reasonable fit for the data over the study interval. based on the characteristics of this particular kind of model, the results should not be extrapolated beyond the time points used to generate the model. WOMAC physical function subscale met preoperative scores at one to two weeks. preoperative LEFS scores met between 7 \u2013 8 weeks and ST around 8 to 10 weeks. it would appear that the WOMAC subscale is not reflecting the early deterioration that occurs in physical function. the 6 MWT and ST would not be the best measures for the early postoperative period as in this study between 26\u201333% of patients could not complete them at discharge. Stratford has demonstrated that the ideal assessment interval occurs when 50% of patients achieve a change equal to or greater than the minimal detectable change (MDC) bias will still result if the cause of the missingness is related to the outcome that would have been observed. this could have been a problem in the case of the 26% of patients who were unable to complete the ST at their discharge from the hospital. authors' contributions DMK conceived and designed the study, assisted with the data collection, performed the statistical analysis and prepared the manuscript.
