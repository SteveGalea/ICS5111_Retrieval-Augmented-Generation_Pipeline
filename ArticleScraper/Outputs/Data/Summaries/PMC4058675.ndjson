{"summary": "acute respiratory infections in humans are usually ascribed to one or more of a group of well known viruses, including influenza viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses, corona viruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and certain adenoviruses. despite this limitation, considerable time and money has been spent trying to find the \u201csilver bullet\u201d for specific virus \u201cinfections\u201d so far without much success [6]. ssRNA genome + membrane Hemagglutinin, neuraminidase (others\") + Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (Paramyxoviridae) ssRNA + membrane Membrane components + Parainfluenza viruses (PI 1-4), (Paramyxoviridae) ssRNA, no membrane Capsid proteins, replication + Adenoviruses (Adenoviridae) ds symptoms may include sneezing, stuffy nose, irritation of mucous membranes, excess mucus production, sinusitis, cough, sore throat, malaise and fever, as well as exacerbation of asthma and COPD. symptoms may not be a direct result of virus replication, which in many cases is minimal in airway tissues [10], but rather an indirect consequence of virus-induced inflammatory responses. the limitations of conventional antiviral therapy and prevention were illustrated in 2002 with the sudden appearance of the SARS pandemic. the novel coronavirus responsible for the disease (SARS-CoV) was quickly isolated and its genome sequenced. however no adequate antiviral treatment was deemed to be available at that time. atrorubens var atrorubrens Topeka purple coneflower E. atrorubens Echinacea laevigata (Boynton and Beadle) Blake Smooth coneflower E. laevigata Echinacea atrorubens var paradoxa (J. B. S. Norton) Britt. a group of caffeoyl derivatives from dried and fresh E. pallida plants examined two of them, cichoric acid and echinacoside, as well as caffeic acid, a constituent of E. purpurea. activity was relatively weak, except at high and cytotoxic concentrations. E. purpurea roots Influenza A, HSV-1, rhinovirus [23] E. pallida, aerial parts & roots HSV-1 and -2 [24] E.sanguinea, inflorescence HSV-1, influenza A [20] Other species Weak or no activity [20] Vimalanathan et al. similar studies were carried out to compare root extracts from E. purpurea, E. angustifolia and E. pallida (23). the aqueous fraction of E. purpurea roots showed impressive activity against all three viruses (HSV, influenza, and rhinovirus) in the ethyl acetate fraction, but no activity in the aqueous extracts. a recent study on 10 commercial preparations highlighted the variability of antiviral activity between different preparations. ethanol based extracts had greater antiviral activity than aqueous extracts. however there was no correlation between antiviral activity and anti-inflammatory activity. flu-resistant virus remained fully susceptible to Echinaforce\u00ae [26]. EF inhibited receptor binding activity of influenza A viruses over a range of EF concentrations. EF also inhibited neuraminidase activity in vitro. effects on Virus-Infected Cells A series of studies by Sharma et al. focused on the application of E. purpurea extracts to epithelial cells and tissues infected by viruses. EF could stimulate the secretion of more than 30 different cytokines, including the pro-inflammatory IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNF. cytokines induced by viruses (+) and reversed by Echinaforce\u00ae. extracts and fractions, derived from three common species of Echinacea, were evaluated for their possible inhibitory effects on the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 and IL-8. expression of several cytokine genes in cultured human monocytes was influenced by the nature of the Echinacea preparation. both extracts influenced the expression of many genes, including cytokine genes, although the pattern of expression was different for the two extracts. the effects of a butanol fraction, derived from aerial parts of E. purpurea, on gene expression of immune-related molecules in human dendritic cells. many dendritic cell genes were affected, either up regulated or down-regulated. these studies did not include infected cells, but clearly showed the multiple gene effects of this Echinacea preparation. antiviral components of E. purpurea aerial parts could be polyphenols. anti-inflammatory activities could be due partly to alkylamides or other constituents. further analyses could lead to improvements in the efficacy of the extracts."}
