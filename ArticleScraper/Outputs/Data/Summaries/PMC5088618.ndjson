{"summary": "the introduction porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), an Alphacoronavirus in the order Nidovirales, was first described in England in the 1970s. the virus reached southeast Asia in the 1980s, but reports of PED declined in Europe. in recent years, however, variant strains of PEDV have emerged in China causing high mortality in sucking piglets and spreading rapidly between farms. the national veterinary diagnostic database for GB (VIDA) recorded 13 diagnoses of PED on nine pig units in five counties of England. the last diagnosis was made in 2002 and none since. the archived data does not allow us to draw epidemiological links between these cases. initial PCR amplicon was subjected to conventional Sanger sequencing to confirm the detection of PEDV. next generation full genome sequencing was carried out to avoid the necessity of designing novel primers for such a large RNA genome. three fecal samples tested positive for PEDV and transmissible gastroenteritis virus. a diagnosis of PED was made by testing the samples using a duplex RT-PCR. the initial PCR amplicon was subjected to conventional Sanger sequencing to confirm the detection of PEDV. consensus sequence was generated from 321425 sequence reads. the average coverage for each base pair is 1341.15. phylogeny was performed using the maximum likelihood method. initial trees were obtained by applying the Neighbor-Joining method to a matrix of pairwise distances estimated using a JTT model. a discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+G, parameter = 1.4131) the rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 0% sites). for the ORF1a/b region vary from 95.1% to 96.3% when compared to the other PEDV sequences analysed. this strain is significantly different to other PEDV strains known so far. it is in no part more closely related to other known coronaviruses. isolation of Salmonella Typhimurium in one of the three fecal samples indicates no significant involvement of salmonellosis or Brachyspira-related colitis in this diarrhea outbreak. this clinical presentation may reflect immunity through natural infection in the national herd at that time. no viable virus could be recovered from the limited amount of material available after prolonged storage period.
