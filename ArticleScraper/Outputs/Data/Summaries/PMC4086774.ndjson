{"summary": "hand hygiene compliance is an accepted measure of quality and safety in many countries. the evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene in directly reducing rates of hospital-acquired infections has strengthened in recent years. the evidence for the efficacy of hand hygiene in directly reducing rates of hospital-acquired infections has strengthened in recent years. in many countries, hand hygiene has been incorporated as a measure of quality of care at the national or subnational level [11,12]. in many countries, hand hygiene has been incorporated as a measure of quality of care at the national or subnational level [11,12]. NHHI commenced in 2009 following a number of successful state-based programmes. hand hygiene compliance increased from 63.6 to 68.3% in the first 2 years of this programme. NHHI now involves data submission from more than 740 hospitals three times annually. interventions were introduced sequentially at a rural hospital in new Hampshire. they provided insights into the temporal associations between interventions, hand hygiene performance and clinical outcomes. improvement in hand hygiene was temporally associated with a significant decline in healthcare-associated infections, but there was an increase in (nonclonal) S. aureus infections attributable to the operating room. the intervention was significantly associated with improved hand hygiene compliance. hand hygiene compliance rose postrandomization in intensive therapy units, but not aged care wards. 80% of the current budget is required solely to maintain appropriate auditor (and therefore data) standardization to allow valid interhospital comparisons. 80% of the current budget is required solely to maintain appropriate auditor (and therefore data) standardization. room entry Easy to teach Nonvalidated Auditors are not required to enter patient rooms Does not risk stratify hand hygiene contacts Is the basis of many automated compliance audit systems Limited interhospital comparisons Locally developed tools Associated with local engagement Nonvalidated Tool can be tailored to local practices Usually no risk stratification Interhospital comparisons invalid Auditing of hand hygiene \u2018Opportunities\u2019 vs. \u2018Moments\u2019 \u2018Opportunities\u2019 are clinically logical compared with \u2018Moments\u2019. facilities across the USA 76.1% direct observation at least every 3 months Primarily room entry and exit although numbers not specified 39.8% ABHR consumption 34.1% soap consumption Fuller et al. [32] 16 acute hospitals in England and Wales Direct observation Hand Hygiene Observation Tool (HHOT) use of ABHR as a surrogate for hand hygiene behaviour has been widely used across Europe [46], including Germany [42] and Britain [18]. consumption data does not take into account the frequency of occasions when hand hygiene should have been performed, nor the appropriateness of ABHR usage. a key issue with all these studies is that they utilize in-vivo models to extrapolate to clinical effectiveness. gels and foams appeared to be equally acceptable to healthcare workers in one study [59], while solutions were preferred in others [13,14,16,17] a variety of ABHR formulations appeared to have equivalent efficacy to soap and water handwashing in reducing hand contamination with H1N1 influenza. despite these in-vivo studies, the clinical utility of ABHR for preventing respiratory virus infections in the community remains less certain. 104 healthcare workers had their hands heavily contaminated (108 cfu/ml) with two strains of VRE. guidelines on the control of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative infections have been published by the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases. recent experience with emerging pathogens has highlighted the importance of isolation precautions. recent progress into the molecular epidemiology of infections due to VRE and C. difficile has provided new insights into modes of pathogen acquisition. 45% of cases were due to transmission from either environmental reservoirs or transmission from asymptomatic carriers, rather than previous symptomatic hospital cases. a single-centre retrospective cohort study by Karki et al.[97] compared the incidence rate of documented adverse events in patients before and after contact precautions for VRE. the same group also observed that the waiting time for patients to obtain a CT scan was 46% longer than those who were not isolated. a randomized controlled trial involving 10 intensive care units was not effective in reducing transmission rates. a number of medical errors and adverse events were observed more frequently in the patients under contact isolation [102] this occurred despite the higher staffing ratios in the ICU compared with other wards."}
