{"summary": "many cellular compounds undergo redox modifications, and some of these redox-modified molecules function in signal transduction. oxidative stress was attributed to the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and/or reactive nitrogen species (RNS) angina pectoris (79), a disease from which also Alfred Nobel, the inventor of the nitroglycerin-based explosive dynamite, suffered. in the 1890s Nobel's physicians recommended nitroglycerin as a remedy for his heart disease, he declined it. in 1979, Louis J. Ignarro and his coworkers demonstrated thatNO andNO-releasing drugs induce the relaxation of the coronary artery through the activation of guanylate cycla de Rey-Pailhade described a nearly ubiquitous substance that he had isolated from yeast, bovine, sheep, fish, egg, and asparagus. it released hydrogen sulfide (H2S), bleached several dyes, and reacted with halogenates. de Rey-Pailhade suggested the name philothion\u2014\u201csulfur-loving\u201d (637\u2013639) redox signaling was shown to be localized to distinct regions within a cell or even a compartment at a given time point. many key regulators of redox signaling are members of the thioredoxin (Trx)-fold family of proteins, among them the proteins highlighted in this review: Trxs, glutaredoxins (Grxs), and peroxiredoxins (Prxs) the first branch and the name-giving proteins of the Trx family of proteins were discovered by Peter Reichard and coworkers in 1964 in their quest to discover the electron/hydrogen donor for ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) the characteristic dithiol active site motif, Cys-Gly-Pro-Cys, facilitates the reduction of the disulfide formed in the catalytic cycle of RNR. it was not until 1993 that the previously identified thiol-specific antioxidant activity (380) could be assigned to the torin-homolog from yeast (103). the name Prx was coined by Sue Goo Rhee and coworkers in 1994 in a \u201cnote added in proof\u201d (104). structure and reaction mechanisms members of the Trx fold family share a common structural motif. the motif consists of three -helices surrounding a central core of a four-stranded -sheet. in higher organisms, the motif may contain additional -helices or -sheets. the oxidized thio- or Grx is reduced by thioredoxin reductase (TrxR), receiving electrons from NADPH. the oxidized Grx is reduced by NADPH via glutathione reductase (GR) and GSH. NADPH as the main electron source reduces the selenoprotein thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) which delivers electrons to Trx, which then reduces protein (P) disulfides. NADPH donates electrons to glutathione reductase (GR), which reduces glutathione disulfide (GSSG), thereby generating two molecules of reduced GSH. the redox-active, peroxidatic Cys (labeled p) is oxidized to sulfenic acid (C 1). 1-Cys Prxs lack an additional resolving cysteine and are reduced by GSH. in the presence of H2O2, the sulfenic acid can be further oxidized to sulfinic acid [5] and sulfonic acid [9]. atypical 2-Cys Prxs (e.g., human Prx5) form an intramolecular disulfide. the releasing cysteinyl residue is located in the C-terminus of the same subunit. the disulfides in both types of 2-Cys Prxs are reduced primarily by Trxs. Trx fold family of proteins comprises numerous proteins. eukaryotic proteins containing one or more domains are evolutionary related to Trx, Grx or PDI. nucleus, membrane, secreted 36\u2013156 CGHC 7 QSOX2 QSOX2 Sulfhydryloxidase 1 747 Golgi, membrane, secreted 36\u2013156 CGHC 7 QSOX2 QSOX2 Sulfhydryloxidase 2 698 Nucleus, membrane, secreted 34\u2013178 CGHC 8 TMX1 TMX1 Thioredoxin-related transmembrane protein 1 CGPC 16 TXND5 TXNDC5 Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 432 ER lumen 36\u2013169, 170\u2013295, 304\u2013429 CGHC, CGHC, CGHC, CGHC 17 Q3KNW3 TXNDC6 TXNDC6 protein 174 CGPC 18 B7ZME0 TXNDC8 TXNDC8 protein 95 CGPC 19 A9Z1W9 TXNDC 30 ERP44 ERP44 ERP44 Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 44 406 ER 30\u2013138 CRFS 31 PDIA1 P4HB Protein disulfide-isomerase 508 ER, membrane 18\u2013134, 349\u2013475 CGHC, CGHC 32 PDIA2 PDIA2 Protein disulfide-isomerase A2 525 ER 27\u2013152, 367\u2013496 CGHC, CTHC 33 PDIA3 PDIA3 Protein disul GRCR1 GRXCR1 Glutaredoxin domain-containing Cys-rich protein 1 290 127\u2013234 CPSC (CSVC, CTAC) 43 PGES2 PTGES2 Putative uncharacterized protein PTGES2 377 Cytosol, golgi, membrane 90\u2013193 CPFC 44 TRXR1 TXNRD1_v3 Thioredoxin reductase 3 (TGR) 754 Cytosol, nucle 169 CTTE TMX3 (10) and TXNDC5 (16) likely belong to the protein disulfide isomerase group. aa, amino acid; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Trx, thioredoxin. regulation of transcription by controlling activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) or activating protein 1 (AP-1) (1, 480), modulation of the immune response via for example, cytokine expression (685) and the H2O2 and lipid hydroperoxide levels via Prxs (55, 196, 642) TrxR exists as a 55\u201360 kDa homo-dimer in a head-to-tail conformation, with every subunit containing Trx1 and TrxR1 constitute the cytosolic system. a third testis-specific TrxR3, also named thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR), is expressed in germ cells. dithiol (Cys-X-X-Cys) and monothiol (Cys-X-X-Ser) Grxs are classified as monothiol Grxs (277, 432) they act in a system in which electrons are transferred from NADPH, via GR and GSH to Grx. they act in regulation of proliferation (see section II.A.2) and differentiation via the MAP kinase ASK1 and downstream targets (82 the 14 kDa Grx2 shares 34% sequence homology with Grx1. it does not possess the active site motif Cys-Pro-Tyr-Cys, but instead Cys-Ser-Tyr-Cys. this single amino acid change is essential for the coordination of a [2Fe2S] cluster (56) peroxiredoxins Prxs are 20\u201330 kDa proteins that are located in different cellular compartments (283, 822) they are high abundance proteins that can account for up to 1% of soluble cellular proteins (102, 822) they are high abundance proteins that can account for up to 1% of soluble cellular proteins (102, 822) expression of some Prxs is regulated by hyperoxia (378, 379). Knockout mice for peroxiredoxins (Prx1\u20134, 6) generally showed increased ROS levels, but were viable. at least 723 proteins may contain at least one Trx fold domain. the 55 kDa protein is located in both the cytosol and the nucleus. no nuclear localization sequence was identified. Nrx was shown to reduce insulin and seems to regulate distinct transcription factors, including NF-B and AP-1. TXNDC2/Sp-Trx1 can oxidize a specific substrate, in the presence of the electron acceptor selenite. TXNDC3/Sp-Trx2 is also a testis-specific protein, consisting of a N-terminal Trx-domain and three consecutive NDP kinase domains. the difference in redox potentials between products and reactants is a measure of the change in free energy G. in a biological system held at constant pressure and temperature, G determines whether a chemical reaction or reaction sequence is thermodynamically favorable. however, G does not determine the reaction kinetics, it leaves no clue whether and at what rate the reaction actually takes place. metabolites that hold the potential to induce reversible post-translational redox modifications on proteins are H2O2, NO, peroxynitrite/peroxynitrous acid (ONOO/ONOOH), and possibly, H2S. the decay of these compounds is controlled by other, independent enzymes, for example, H2O2 and ONOOH are reduced by GPxs and Prxs. us acid by glutathione peroxidases (GPxs) or PRX reacts with protein thiolates, yielding protein sulfenic acids. [10] Spontaneous decomposition of peroxynitrous acid to hydroxy radicals and NO2. [13] Peroxynitrite and carbon dioxide react spontaneously to nitrosoperoxycarbonate. [22] sulfenic acids may be further irreversibly oxidized, for example, by H2O2. the metal-catalyzed Fenton reaction yields hydroxyl anions and hydroxy radicals. hydroxy radicals remove hydrogen from volatile organic compounds, yielding water and alkyl radicals. translational redox modifications of protein thiols Proteins can be regulated post-translationally via reversible redox modifications. thiol groups of cysteinyl side chains constitute the major targets. methionyl and selenocysteinyl residues undergo reversible redox modifications. the susceptibility of cysteinyl side chains to undergo S-nitrosylation is determined by the electrostatic and hydrophobic environment of the thiol. the micro-environment of the cysteinyl side chains determines their reactivity toward different redox compounds and, therefore, the specificity of redox signaling in general. in the presence of excessive peroxides, it can be irreversibly over-oxidized to sulfinic (R-SO2H) and sulfonic acid (R-SO3H) the reduction of sulfinic acids to sulfenic acids is specific for Prxs. if present in the thiolate form, some react with H2O2 or ONOOH to form the sulfenic acid intermediates. the formation of sulfenic acids on cysteinyl side chains is via the formation and subsequent reduction of a disulfide formed with another thiol. both Trxs and Grxs catalyze the reduction of protein disulfides. the most efficient way of protein disulfide formation would be via specialized transducer proteins, that is, proteins which show a very high reactivity toward, for example, H2O2 leading to oxidation and disulfide formation. grxs have a very high affinity for the GSH moiety. they catalyze the reduction of mixed disulfides, the de-glutathionylation. they catalyze the forward reaction, that is, the glutathionylation of protein thiols. GSNO is catalyzed, for example, by ceruloplasmin, the decay by GSNO reductases (203). GSNO may qualify as a second-messenger molecule in redox signaling. methionine sulfoxidation is reversible through the action of the Trx-dependent methionine sulfoxide reductases (Msr), reviewed in (739). this post-translational modification is discussed to be involved in metabolic regulation and cell signaling. structure and reaction mechanisms members of the Trx fold family share a common structural motif. structure and reaction mechanisms consists of three -helices surrounding a central core of a four-stranded -sheet (471) in higher organisms, the motif may contain additional -helices or -sheets. the N-terminal active site thiol has a low pKa value, allowing the initiation of a nucleophilic attack on a target disulfide and the formation of a transient covalently bound mixed disulfide intermediate. in the second step, the C-terminal active site thiol reduces the mixed disulfide, yielding the reduced substrate and an oxidized thio- or Grx (Fig. 4A, B, reaction E. coli Grx1 (PDB accession number: 1EGR) contains an additional N-terminal sheet and helix. the 2-Cys Prx1 is shown as monomer (D) and (E) decameric torin. electron flow from NADPH to substrate via the Trx and GSH/Grx systems. redox-active, peroxidatic Cys (labeled p) is oxidized to sulfenic acid (C 1). 1-Cys Prxs lack an additional resolving cysteine and are reduced by GSH. in the presence of H2O2, the sulfenic acid can be further oxidized to sulfinic acid [5] and sulfonic acid [9]. 2-Cys Prxs (human Prx 1\u20134) form an intramolecular disulfide. the releasing cysteinyl residue is located in the C-terminus of the proteins. atypical 2-Cys Prxs (e.g., human Prx5) form an intramolecular disulfide. sulfinic acid to a sulfinic phosphoryl ester (355) reacts to a thiosulfinate with Prx. this intermediate is reduced to a sulfenic acid on the peroxidatic cysteinyl residue of Prx. this reaction depends on the disulfide formation between Srx and other thiols. human Genome Are Enlisted Uniprot Gene Name aa Compartment Trx-domain(s) Active site Thioredoxin related 1 DJC16 DNAJC16 DnaJ homlog subfamily C member 16 782 Membrane 119\u2013247 CFSC 2 NHLC2 NHLRC2 NHL repeat-containing protein 2 726 43\u2013200 CINC\" 3 NXN NXN Nucleoredoxin 435 Cytosol, nucleus (\u2013), 167 chondria 61\u2013166 CGPC 14 TXND2 TXNDC2 Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 2 (Sp-Trx1) 553 Cytosol 429\u2013553 CGPC 15 TXND3 TXNDC3 Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 3 (Sp-Trx2) 588 Cytosol 2\u2013119 CGPC 16 TXND5 TXNDC5 Thioredoxin domain-containing protein 5 protein disulfide isomerases 29 ERP27 ERP27 Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 27 273 ER 39\u2013152. 30 ERP44 ERP44 ERP44 Endoplasmic reticulum resident protein 44 406 ER 30\u2013138 CRFS 31 PDIA1 P4HB Protein disulfide-isomerase 508 ER, membrane 18\u2013134, 349\u2013475 CGHC.

(ASK1) and initiated downstream cascades (479, 670) regulation of transcription by controlling activity of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-B) or activating protein 1 (AP-1) (1, 480), modulation of the immune response via for example, cytokine expression (685) different isoforms of TrxR have been described, giving rise to different proteins with distinct functions (657, 785) besides its main substrate Trx, it was shown to reduce other targets, including PDI (454), Grx2 (349), and dehydroascorbate (482). four Grxs have been discovered in mammals. they are classified as monothiol (Cys-X-X-Cys) and monothiol (Cys-X-X-Ser) Grxs. they act in regulation of proliferation and differentiation via MAP kinase ASK1 and downstream targets. the dithiol 12 kDa Grx1 is localized in the cytosol. it can be translocated into the nucleus, exported from the cell. different cancer/testis-specific isoforms, restricted to the cytosol, have been described in mouse and human. a molecular weight of around 17 kDa has a mitochondrial translocation signal. no disulfide reductase activity was observed for the mitochondrial Grx5. only knockout of Grx3 in mice is embryonically lethal (105) a leader peptide is believed to be essential for protein secretion (558) it is localized in cytosol, mitochondria, and peroxisomes. expression of some Prxs is regulated by hyperoxia (378, 379) Nrx is characterized by two N-terminal Trx-like domains with active site motif Cys-Pro-Pro-Cys and a C-terminal PDI-like domain without any redox active Cys residues. the 55 kDa protein is located in both the cytosol and the nucleus. it suppresses the Wnt/-catenin pathway, essential for embryonic development. nucleoside-diphosphate (NDP) kinase family was found to be associated to microtubular structures, potentially regulating microtubuli physiology (664) the protein reduces insulin in the presence of NADPH and TrxR (498) Trx family proteins are moreover characterized by their active site motifs. thiol groups are essential for (i) the reduction of protein disulfides, (ii) protein de-/glutathionylation and de-/trans-/nitrosylation. the monothiol mechanism is unique to Grxs and depends only on the N-terminal active site cysteinyl residue (Fig. 4B, reaction 5), which forms a GSH-mixed disulfide intermediate. thus, the substrate is reduced by a second molecule of GSH. x reduces protein disulfides via the dithiol mechanism, depending on both active site cysteines. the N-terminal active site Cys forms a covalently bound mixed disulfide intermediate (A 1), which is reduced by the C-terminal active site Cys, releasing the reduced protein (A 2). the presence of H2O2 can be further oxidized to sulfinic acid [5] and sulfonic acid [9]. the reduction of H2O2 by Prxs is a multi-step reaction, reviewed for instance in (641) in the first step, H2O2 is partially reduced to water. in the second step, a resolving cysteinyl residue forms a disulfide with the N-terminal thiol in a s Prx family (human Prx6) lack the additional resolving cysteinyl residue and can be reduced by GSH (121) in yeast, this reduction also involves a dithiol Grx (583) in the access of substrate, Prxs may be over-oxidized by formation of sulfinic and sulfonic acids on the peroxidatic active site thiol. eukaryotic proteins containing one or more domains are evolutionary related to Trx, Grx, or PDI. all these proteins share similar structural motifs, but most of them have unique functions, which do not necessarily depend on the catalysis of redox reactions. e 2 698 Nucleus, membrane,

(418), proliferation (see section II.B.2) and protection against apoptosis via the reduction of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1). p53 and DJ-1 in mice resulted in either up- or down-regulation of Trx1 and also via increased or decreased levels of Nrf2 respectively. TrxR exists as a 55\u201360 kDa homo-dimer in a head-to-tail conformation, with every subunit containing a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domain. the 43\u201344 kDa Trx interacting protein (Txnip) belongs to the arrestin superfamily of regulatory proteins. it binds to the active site of Trx, inhibiting its disulfide reductase activity. it was suggested to be an endogenous Trx inhibitor. four kDa Grxs have been discovered in mammals. they act in regulation of proliferation (see section II.A.2) and differentiation via the MAP kinase ASK1 and downstream targets (82, 529), apoptosis (see section II.A.1) by inhibiting caspase activation (571) and cytochrome c release from mitochondria (167), transcription via modulating the activity of NF-B (140) the 38 kDa monothiol Grx3 is a multi-domain protein that contains two N-terminal monothiol Grx domains with the active site Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser and an additional C-terminal Trx domain with the active site motif Ala-Pro-Gln-Cys. it is localized in the cytosol and the nucleus. atypical 2-Cys Prxs (Prx1\u20134), atypical 2-Cys Prxs (Prx5) and 1-Cys Prx (Prx6). most Prxs function as homo-dimers, the 2-Cys Prxs also form decamers. the different conformations are linked to switches in function (42) functions in disulfide bond formation, intracellular signaling, and protection from peroxides have been described (281). in humans, there are various Trx-like proteins, including nucleoredoxin (Nrx), Thioredoxin-like protein (Txl) 1 and 2, the latter also known as thioredoxin-like protein (TXNDC) 6, sperm-specific thioredoxin (Sp-Trx) 1\u20133, also known ubiquitously expressed Txl1 is a two-domain protein, composed of a N-terminal Trx-domain and a C-terminal domain with unknown function (497) the ubiquitously expressed protein is composed of a N-terminal Trx-domain and a C-terminal domain with unknown function (497), which was shown to receive electrons from TrxR1 (344) inantly expressed TXNDC3/Sp-Trx2 in E. coli does not show any oxidoreductase activity (663) the protein is exclusively found in male germ cells, where it is located in the Golgi apparatus. no reduction of insulin was detected in enzymatic assays (345) TrxR exists as a 55\u201360 kDa homo-dimer in a head-to-tail conformation. it possesses every subunit containing a flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) domain. p53 and DJ-1 in mice resulted in either up- or down-regulation. Trx1 and Trx2 share 35% sequence homology and similar catalytic properties in vitro (736) with mitochondrial Trx2 possessing the active site motif of Trx1 but lacking additional structural cysteines. thioredoxin-binding protein 2 (TBP2) or vitamin D up-regulated protein 1 (VDUP1) does not possess a Trx fold. thiol Grxs act in a system in which electrons are transferred from NADPH, via GR and GSH to Grx and then to the oxidized target. they act in regulation of proliferation (see section II.A.2) and differentiation via the MAP kinase ASK1 and downstream targets (82, 529), apoptosis (see section II.A.1) by inhibiting caspase activation (571) and cytochrome c release from monothiol Grx3 is a multi-domain protein that contains two N-terminal monothiol Grx domains with the active site Cys-Gly-Phe-Ser and an additional C-terminal Trx domain with the active site motif. the monothiol Grx5 has a molecular weight of around 17 kDa, has a mitochondrial translocation signal and shares the active site motif of Grx3. atypical 2-Cys Prxs (Prx5), and 1-Cys Prx (Prx6) are found in mammalian cells. atypical 2-Cys Prxs (Prx5) and 1-Cys Prx (Prx6) are also found in serum. several proteins share the active site motif Cys-X-X-X-Cys. but there are Trx-like proteins that lack the active site and any oxidoreductase activity. functions in disulfide bond formation, intracellular signaling, and protection from peroxides have been described. ubiquitously expressed Txl1 is a two-domain protein, composed of a N-terminal Trx-domain and a C-terminal domain with unknown function (497) the ubiquitously expressed protein is composed of a N-terminal Trx-domain and a C-terminal domain, which is typical of the nucleoside-diphosphate family. recombinantly expressed TXNDC3/Sp-Trx2 in E. coli does not show any oxidoreductase activity (663). the protein is exclusively found in male germ cells, where it is located in the Golgi apparatus. no reduction of insulin was detected in enzymatic assays (345). in a biological system held at constant pressure and temperature, G determines whether a chemical reaction or reaction sequence is thermodynamically favorable. however, G does not determine the reaction kinetics, it leaves no clue whether and at what rate the reaction actually takes place. even thermodynamically favorable reactions cannot occur if the activation energy is too high. the decay of these compounds is controlled by other, independent enzymes, such as superoxide (O2) produced by complex I of the inner mitochondrial membrane. the levels of these redox-active second messengers are, thus, enzymatically regulated on both the production and elimination side. [12] peroxynitrite and carbon dioxide react spontaneously to nitrosoperoxycarbonate. [14] Spontaneous decay of nitrosoperoxycarbonate to carbonate radical anions and nitrate. [16] Nitration may also be initiated by NO2. hydroxy radicals remove hydrogen from volatile organic compounds, yielding water and alkyl radicals. hypochloric acid may lead to the chlorination of organic compounds. modifications labeled with a light gray background are reversible and important in redox signaling. thiol groups can be oxidized to a disulfide, forming a strong inter- or intramolecular bridge. two protein thiols can be oxidized to a disulfide, forming a strong inter- or intramolecular bridge. a single protein thiol may also form a disulfide with GSH. the micro-environment of the cysteinyl side chains determines their reactivity toward different redox compounds. free thiol groups (R-SH) can be reversibly modified by ROS, leading to the formation of protein disulfides (R-S-S-R), which can be reduced by the Trx and Grx systems. sulfenylation Oxidation of thiol groups to sulfenic acids may occur directly by a reaction of susceptible thiols/thiolates with H2O2 or ONOO. if present in the thiolate form, some may react with H2O2 or ONOOH to form the sulfenic acid intermediates. in excess of H2O2 or ONOO/ONOOH, these intermediates may be oxidized further to sulfinic and sulfonic acids. both GPxs and Prxs are substrates for peroxidases, that is, GPxs and Prxs (outside peroxisomes) these enzymes form sulfenic intermediates on their selenolate (GPx1\u20134 & 6) or thiolate (GPx the most efficient way of protein disulfide formation would be via specialized transducer proteins, that is, proteins which show a very high reactivity toward, for example, H2O2 leading to oxidation and disulfide formation on the transducer protein. such disulfide relay systems have been described in bacteria and lower eukaryotes. S-nitrosylation NO is best known for its relaxing function in smooth muscle cells surrounding the vasculature. it was recognized early on that NO leads to the reversible modification of cysteinyl residues by the formation of S-nitroso thiols by the formation of S-nitroso thiols. persulfide formation H2S is, similar to NO, an endogenously produced gaseous signaling molecule. it is produced enzymatically by three different enzymes (Fig. 6), cystathionine -synthase, cystathionine -lyase, and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase (MST) sulfenylation Oxidation of thiol groups to sulfenic acids may occur directly by a reaction of susceptible thiols/thiolates with H2O2 or ONOO. if present in the thiolate form, some may react with H2O2 or ONOOH to form the sulfenic acid intermediates. fide formed with another thiol may be oxidized further to sulfinic and sulfonic acids. both H2O2 and ONOOH are substrates for peroxidases, that is, GPxs and Prxs (outside peroxisomes) dox modification is most efficient way of protein disulfide formation. specialized transducer proteins show a very high reactivity toward, for example, H2O2 leading to oxidation and disulfide formation on the transducer protein. this disulfide could then be transferred to effector proteins.

Prx6 showed intense nuclear staining patterns in the outermost layer of the olfactory epithelium of the nose (arrows) and also appeared distributed in the olfactory nerve bundles (arrows). arrows show a consistent nuclear staining pattern in the duodenal epithelium. grx5 immunoreactivity was the strongest of all analyzed proteins in the lens fibers. most Trxs, Grxs, and Prxs have been observed in the stratified squamous epithelium of the mouse tongue and the underlying skeletal muscles. retinopathy and AMD are associated with hypertension-induced oxidative stress. formation of cataracts is mainly based on oxidative stress induced by intrinsic factors such as hypertension. over-expression of Trx1 suppressed reduction of photoreceptors and the apoptosis induced by high light exposure in mice retina. the rat retina increased the levels of Txnip, the proposed Trx1 antagonist, which may contribute to inflammation and subsequent apoptosis. over-expression of Trx2 in the retina and the optic nerve attenuated degeneration after intra-ocular pressure (526, 527) Prx3 was induced in human and mouse lens cells after treatment with H2O2 (420) over-expression of Prx5 in Xenopus embryos reduced alcohol-induced eye malformation. over-expression of Prx6 attenuated hypoxia-induced retinal ganglion cell death (784), and treatment of retinal ganglion cells with Prx6 decreased glutamate and TNF-induced cell death. levels of Trx1 were positively correlated with the respiratory disturbance in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. cisplatin is strongly ototoxic to cochlea hair cells in a guinea pig model. embryonic day E8.5, Trx1 and Grx1 are detectable in the heart and great vessels of the mouse embryo. the myocardium and the wall of great vessels showed strong immunoreactivities for Trx1 and Grx1 and remained positive until adulthood (396). the same group described that Trx1 modulates cardiac hypertrophy via up-regulation of miR98 transcription, which down-regulates cyclin D2 an essential mediator of angiotensin II-induced cardiac hypertophy (845). a recent genetic study revealed that individuals carrying polymorphisms up-regulating Txnip expression show increased susceptibility to hypertension (190) severity of myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart most likely due to virus infection, is correlated to Trx1. increased levels of Trx1 protect against several pathological conditions in the cardiovascular system. treatment with human recombinant Trx1 attenuated several pathological processes affecting the cardiovascular system. mitochondrial TrxR2 knockout resulted in embryonic lethality due to dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure (135). resulting proteins were not able to restore TrxR2 function in mouse fibroblasts lacking TrxR2 (713) grx3 was up-regulated after treatment with enthothelin-1 and phenylephrine (337) this effect was mediated by interference of Grx3 with calcineurin-nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) signaling. a patient with reduced levels of Grx5 exhibited sideroblastic-like hypochromic anemia. in the skin are produced, among others, by gaseous airborne environmental pollutants, UV radiation, cosmetic products, drugs, and certain food constituents/contaminants (32, 61). skeletal muscle ROS and RNS are continuously generated in skeletal muscle cells and increased during contraction and fatigue. all Trxs and Prxs are present in the human skeletal muscle. the strongest expression was detected for Prx2 (143) in mouse skeletal muscle, Grx2, Nrx, Prx1 and Prx5. rheumatoid arthritis patients were significantly higher compared with osteoarthritis patients. correlated with inflammatory indicators in the serum and synovial fluid (342). the respiratory system is the main oxygen delivering interface between the host and the environment. some redox proteins were detected in alveolar cells (i.e., TrxR1, GR, Prx2 and Prx6) as well as in macrophages of human lungs (i.e., Trx2, TrxR1, TrxR1, TrxR1_v3, TrxR2, and Prx3) (143). in the adult mouse and rat, only the mitochondrial Trx system along with the cytosolic peroxiredoxins, Prx2 and Pr inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma or COPD show altered ratios of GSH to GSSG (198, 617) and its biosynthesizing enzyme GCS (261, 618) an increase of GCS, especially in the epithelium, might be counter-regulation of ongoing inflammatory responses in pulmonary diseases (626) an intraperitoneal injection of recombinant human Trx 1 suppressed bleomycin-induced acute interstitial pneumonia in mice. an up-regulation of Trx1 and TrxR1 in epithelial cells was detected (251, 604). the expression in sarcoidosis and allergic alveolitis patient samples is decreased. Prx3, Prx5, and Prx6 were abundantly expressed in the bronchial epithelium, protecting epithelial cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death. only Prx6 was found to be induced in sputum supernatant (424). expression pattern of Trx-related proteins in lymphoid tissues. phagocytic cells of the innate immune system destroy pathogens via the NADPH oxidase-dependent formation of ROS. ROS can activate an increased immune response via redox-sensitive signaling pathways, including NF-B-activation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- (494, 687) the authors hypothesized that DCs may activate T cells by creating a reducing milieu in the immunological synapse, providing them with free thiols (25). this is especially important because intracellular GSH, which is generated from cysteine, is essential in the response to mitogenic and antigenic stimuli (491). extracellular functions are not based on the reduction of disulfides, but rather on the transfer of disulfides to target-soluble proteins or surface-exposed cellular structures. oxidoreductase was detected in blood plasma in various clinical conditions, such as cancer (541), rheumatoid arthritis (342), type-2 diabetes (363), and HIV infection (543). cytokines, such as TNF-, IL-1, IL-2, and IL-8 in monocytes and dose dependently of IL-6 in fibrosarcoma and endothelial cells. Trx1 translocates from the cytosol into the nucleus on TNF- treatment. Controversially, Trx1 was also shown to reduce a general inflammatory response (58) x1 may act as a redox sensor on a yet unknown substrate protein. higher chemokine levels could have the oppositional effect. higher chemokine levels could lead to impaired leukocyte migration. MCs and monocytes (586, 587), induction and secretion of pro-inflammatory mediators into the plasma, role as a chemoattractant for monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells (65), and activation of MAPK signaling pathways (585). the Trx-like protein Nrx functions in the innate immune response via the stabilization of the interaction of flightless homolog 1 and myeloid differentiation primary response protein MyD88. sulfate regulates H2O2-induced signaling pathways. it regulates the H2O2-mediated activation of NF-B via modulation of the inhibitory protein IB. cytosolic Grx1 was demonstrated in the extracellular compartment. grx3 was identified as an interaction partner of protein kinase C- (819), which regulates TCR-mediated signaling and the activation of transcription factors. over-expression of Grx3 in T cells led to decreased phosphorylation and activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (NFAT) and NF-B (819) pore-forming immune toxins (PFTs) and pathogen-binding immunoglobulines evolved. parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida lack the eukaryotic (GSH)/GR and (Trx)/TrxR system. trypanosomatids contain the parasite-specific tryparedoxin. Trx exerts differential regulatory functions on circulating immunoglobulins by reducing intermolecular disulfides between heavy and light chains. the potent antimicrobial peptide human -defensin 1 is activated by Trx (688), which shows that secreted Trx from both host and intruding agents is being used to counteract respective defense mechanisms. an unusual monothiol Grx has been found in the Chlorella virus PBCV-1 genome. it is relevant for DNA replication as a subunit of the T7 bacteriophage DNA polymerase and filamentous phage assembly. innate immune mechanisms are further compromised by elevated Trx serum levels that impair CD4+ cell survival by blocking pathogen-induced chemotaxis. a regulation and/or maintenance of protease activity in HIV-1 infected cells was suggested. specialized macrophages of the liver, Grx1, Grx3, and Prx5 were significantly stained. Prx6 along with Prx2, Prx3, and Trx2 were also detected in human hepatocytes. both proteins are distributed through the nucleus of acinous and islets. in the human exocrine part of the pancreas, Trx2, TrxR1, GR, and Prx2, Prx4 and Prx6 showed the most evident staining.

NO potentially inactivates PHDs via nitrosylation, as seen in HEK293 cells treated with S-nitroso glutathione (492) or can nitrosylate HIF-1 at a Cys residue within the degradation domain, preventing its destruction (431) another regulatory mechanism of HIF-1 is the generally increased translation due to phosphorylation of essential proteins such as by phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase/Akt-dependent or MA many Trx family proteins show distinct expression patterns in cancer. the authors speculate that Prx6 could be used in the clinic. treatment with recombinant Trx1 protected retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. wound gets hypoxic, with an oxygen gradient being present between the last perfused capillary and the wound space. angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, is also induced by hypoxia. I/R injury is induced surgically and during cell and organ transplantation. pretreatment of rat donor lungs with Trx1 decreased tissue rejection, due to inhibition of I/R injury, NF-B activation, and the inflammatory response. out hearts showed reduced recovery of left ventricular function, increased myocardial infarct size, and elevated levels of apoptotic cardiomyocytes (534). we have recently analyzed the expression of 16 Trx-related proteins in a mouse model for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury. we believe these differences contribute to the distinct susceptibilities of different parts of the nephron toward the ischemic insult. ing functions in the regeneration process of cells after I/R (236) hypothermia reduces ROS levels (99), NF-B activation, and inflammation (806) hypothermia has been used as a clinical approach to reduce I/R injury. hypothermal preconditioning can be compared with general IPC. resistance to I/R damage is induced by exposing a tissue to several ischemic episodes (516) IPC induced ROS, which are believed to alter various cellular targets including transcription factors. it is not possible to classify Trx family proteins as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. the proteins can stimulate the DNA binding activity of p53 and potentiate Ref-1-stimulated p53 activity both in vitro and in vivo. c-Myc-mediated transformation was inhibited, implying a tumor suppressor role for Prx1 (163, 531). increased levels of Prxs have been described for Prx1 in ovarian cancer proximal fluids (299). mitochondrial dysfunction (134, 726), mitochondrial dysfunction (427, 635, 680), accumulation of oxidative-damaged mitochondrial (192, 834) and nuclear DNA (50), oxidized lipids, and protein-mixed disulfides (68, 628) the expression and/or activity of various mammalian Trx family and related proteins is also known to be reduced during aging. the absence of individual genes or proteins not always leads to a life-shortening phenotype. despite all this supporting evidence, the contribution of ROS to organismic changes is highly controversial. many aging-related proteins are specifically redox regulated, including the lifespan regulator p66Shc (225, 226), MAP kinases (90, 94, 302, 303), the Trx-dependent Msr (89, 520, 600), as well as processes including protein folding and degradation (57, 470, 536). authors found age-dependent pro-oxidants were not equally distributed throughout the organism, but rather restricted to specific regions. the secretion of specific Trxs, Grxs, and Prxs has been described in various clinical disorders. the analysis of sputum, blood, or urine samples for specific proteins has been done through a well-established and noninvasive approach to confirm potential pathological changes in patients. several drugs have been developed to inhibit the oxidoreductase activity. ebselen, reviewed in (175, 452), was analyzed as a potential drug. a strategy might be developed to specifically target Prxs in cancer cells. the activity of Prx2 was enhanced by obovatol, a compound extracted from the medical plant Magnolia obovata, revealing Prx2 as a new target protecting microglia against neuroinflammation (556). it was also shown to have a positive impact in the therapeutic approach of transplantation (see also section II.B.11). glaucoma therapy increases protein levels of Prx2. over-expression of the peroxidase could be used to prevent the progression of hypoxia-dependent disorders, such as glaucoma (784). Trx, Txnip, and Grx act as negative regulators of apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)\u2013ASK1 is a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase kinase kinase kinase that signals downstream to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 MAPK in the nucleus, Trx1, Grx1, and Nrx have been reported to promote NF-B binding to the B site in the DNA.

Dysregulated proliferation is one hallmark of tumor formation. hepatocytes lacking TrxR1 displayed normal supply of electrons to RNR to support DNA replication and normal proliferative growth. in mouse liver lacking TrxR1, GSH was essential, indicating that the GSH- and TrxR1-dependent pathways constitute complementary systems of supporting RNR in this organ. iron metabolism Iron is an essential trace element that is required for a number of protein co-factors. ferrous iron in its free form is an efficient catalyst of the Fenton reaction, generating OH radicals from H2O2. the reaction of OH radicals with proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids generates other radical species that subsequently lead to peroxidation, carbonylation, or fragmentation. ols of two Grx2 monomers and two molecules of GSH are bound noncovalently to the proteins and in equilibrium with GSH in solution (56) the structure of the dimeric holo complex was solved by X-ray diffraction. hardly any direct molecular interactions between the two protein monomers could be identified. holo-Grx2 complex consisting of two monomers Grx2 (cartoon graphics), two GSH molecules (ball and stick model), and the [2Fe2S] cluster (calotte model), derived from PDB entry 2HT9 (348). structure of the holo-Grx5 complex depicted as dimer (B) and tetrameric holo complexes (C), derived from PDB entry 2WUL (350). iron-sulfur centers in eukaryotic cells are an essential function of mitochondria (436) iron-sulfur centers are synthesized on the scaffold protein Isu (IscU or NifU in bacteria) in the next step, these newly assembled [FeS] units are transferred to apo-proteins with the help of a DnaK- and DnaJ-type chaperone couple (437) a crosstalk between the dysfunction of mitochondrial redox homeostasis and the cytosolic iron regulation was thus suggested (486). a crosstalk between the dysfunction of mitochondrial redox homeostasis and the cytosolic iron regulation was thus suggested (486). the ability of monothiol Grxs to bind a [FeS] cluster themselves was an absolute requirement for this function. apoptosis Trxs, Grxs, and Prxs have been implied in many aspects of programmed cell death prevention and induction. apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)\u2013ASK1 is a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase kinase kinase kinase kinase kinase that signals downstream to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 MAP kinase pathways via MAP kinases NF-B, nuclear factor kappa B; Nrx, nucleoredoxin; txnip, trx interacting protein. caspases belong to the class of cysteine proteases. this requirement makes them vulnerable to redox modifications such as S-nitrosylation and S-glutathionylation. inhibition of Prx1 by a recombinant antibody induced apoptosis in lung carcinoma cells. Prx2 inhibited granulosa cell apoptosis during follicle atresia. over-expression of Prx4 suppressed TRAIL-induced apoptosis. cells over-expressing grx2 were less susceptible to apoptosis induced by 2-deoxy D-glucose and doxorubicin. grx2 prevented the loss of cardiolipin and, therefore, cytochrome c release and caspase activation. is a MAP kinase kinase kinase that leads to the activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways. reduced Trx1 and Grx1 bind to N- and C-terminal domains of ASK1 respectively, thereby inhibiting its kinase activity. mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase kinase signals downstream to the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and the p38 MAP kinase pathways via MAP kinases 3, 4, 6, and 7. Oxidation of Trx1 and/or Grx1 by various redox signals leads to dissociation of the complex and activation of ASK1. cytosolic Prxs catalyzes trans-nitrosylation or denitrosylation of caspase-3, thereby regulating protease activity (53, 502). cisplatin is a chemotherapeutic that is effective in the treatment of several tumors. down-regulation of Prx2 expression contributed to angiotensin II-mediated podocyte apoptosis. transgenic over-expression of Prx4 protected mice against high-dose streptozotocin-induced death of pancreatic -cells. transgenic mice over-expressing Grx2 showed an attenuation of doxorubicin-induced cardiac inquiry.

GSSG promoted cluster degradation and thus activation of Grx2 (433) iron-sulfur cluster is complexed by two N-terminal active site thiols of two Grx2 monomers and two molecules of GSH which are bound noncovalently to the proteins. redox-induced cluster decay activated the oxidoreductase. functions of the monothiol Grxs appear to lie primarily in iron metabolism. holo-Grx5 complex depicted as dimer (B) and tetrameric holo complexes (C), derived from PDB entry 2HT9 (348). cis-proline is an amino acid whose presence prevents metal binding in the active site of Trx family proteins. mutation of the Thr-X-X-Cys active site in a Prx, do not contain the cis-proline, resulted in a [FeS] cluster coordinating protein as well. the exact biochemical function of Grx5 in [FeS] center biosynthesis remains to be established. lack of mitochondrial Prx and mitochondrial/cytosolic dithiol Grx in yeast led to the induction the Aft1 iron regulon. solic multi-domain monothiol glutaredoxins Grx3 and Grx4 impaired iron-dependent reactions in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus. Combined depletion of Grx3 and Grx4 specifically impaired all iron-dependent reactions in the cytosol, mitochondria, and nucleus. ency induces defects in cell cycle progression during late mitosis. the mitochondrial monothiol Grx5 is also important for embryonic development. the mitochondrial monothiol Grx5 is also important for embryonic development. Nrx knockout mice show skeletal and cardiovascular defects and die around birth (216) Nrx interacts with dishevelled to regulate both Wnt/-catenin and Wnt/planar cell polarity pathways during embryogenesis. Nrx also regulates via an interaction with Flightless-1 (Fli-1) TLR-4 signaling, another important pathway during embryogenesis (272). Nrx suppresses the Wnt/-catenin pathway, which is involved in embryonic development and cancer. reduced Nrx binds to Dvl and suppresses Wnt/-catenin signaling. reduced Nrx can inhibit TLR4 signaling, which is essential for embryonic development. mice showed a severe anemic phenotype and partial growth retardation. but these phenotypes were less severe compared with Trx1 or Trx2 knockout mice. lack of GSH resulted in failed gastrulation, impaired formation of the mesoderm, and death because of increased apoptosis. Prx1 was reported to be localized in glial cells of several human brain regions, whereas in neurons, it was essentially not present (678). the same study described a reciprocal staining pattern for Prx2, which was exclusively expressed in neurons but not in glia. the substantia nigra pars compacta, the locus coeruleus, the ependyma of the 4th ventricle, and the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (441).

NS In this section, we summarized the role of Trx family members in cellular and animal models, as well as in patients suffering, from AD, PD, ALS, ischemia/stroke. over-expression of Trx1 attenuated MPP+-induced neurotoxicity of PC12 cells. mitochondrial Trx2 levels increased in hippocampus of gerbils after ischemia reperfusion (316) the electron donor of Trx2, TrxR2, is not essential for the development of the central nervous system. over-expression of both Grx1 and Grx2 in immortalized motoneurons increased solubility of mutant SOD1 but only Grx2 protected against subsequent apoptosis. over-expression of both Grx1 and Grx2 in immortalized motoneurons increased solubility of mutant SOD1 but only Grx2 protected against subsequent apoptosis. in amyloid -resistant clones of the PC12 cell line, Prxs1, 2, and 6 expression was significantly increased. treatment with 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) led to an oxidation of Prx1. increased Prx2 levels protected dopaminergic cells both in vitro and in vivo. circulating endothelial progenitor cells of ischemia stroke patients, Prx1 was tenfold higher expressed than in healthy controls (76). in rat brains down-regulated after cerebral ischemia (399), protected against stroke-related insults, such as ischemia and glutamate treatment in vitro and in vivo (70, 624). in the mouse eye, no or only weak immunoreactivities were detected for Grx2 and Grx3 in photoreceptor cells. in the retina, the layer of rods and cones showed clear differences in localization of certain Trx-related proteins. the inner segment of the photoreceptors is rich in mitochondria. x6 immunoreactivities were detected in several layers of the retina. despite the high melanin content in the retinal pigmented epithelium, Nrx staining in this layer is evident. s Grx5 and Nrx immunoreactivities appear to be concentrated in specific areas of the cells, that is, the apical pole for Grx5 and the lateral sides for Nrx. most Trxs, Grxs, and Prxs have been observed in the stratified squamous epithelium of the mouse tongue and the underlying skeletal muscles. glaucoma is one of the leading causes of blindness in the world that is connected to selective death of retinal ganglion cells. retinopathy and AMD are associated with hypertension-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, causing loss of vision. administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate to mammalian eyes stimulated glutamate receptors and induced retinal damage. an intravitreous injection of Trx1 effectively attenuated NMDA-induced retinal cell damage. decreased levels of Txnip attenuated early signs of diabetic retinopathy (595), and Txnip expression levels increased after IOP (528). in patients with diabetic retinopathy, Prx1 was increased in the vitreous (219) Nipradilol and timolol, two drugs used in glaucoma therapy, induced the expression of Prx2. Prx3 was induced in human and mouse lens cells after treatment with H2O2 (420) over-expression of Prx5 attenuated hypoxia-induced retinal ganglion cell death (784) no significant change of expression of Trx1 and TrxR1 was detected in nasal polyps compared with normal human nasal mucosa (421), whereas Grx1 was reported to be over-expressed in nasal polyps. levels of Trx1 were positively correlated with the respiratory disturbance in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. Trx1 was detected in hearts and erythrocytes from a calf by a radioimmunoassay (292) seven years later, both Trx1 and TrxR1 were detected by immunohistochemistry in the cytosol of epithelial cells in adult rats (654). the myocardium and the wall of great vessels showed strong immunoreactivities for Trx1 and Grx1. mice with cardiac-specific over-expression of wildtype Trx1 were protected against hypertrophy. a recent genetic study revealed that individuals carrying polymorphisms up-regulating Txnip expression show increased susceptibility to hypertension. ubicin (Adriamycin) is one of the most effective drugs in the treatment of several types of cancers. however, its therapeutic use is limited due to its high cardiotoxicity (873) Trx1 prevented damage of cardiac tissue via inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression, adhesion of neutrophils, and subsequent inflammatory injury of hearts occurring in response to ischemia/reperfusion. Trx1 levels in blood and serum of patients with dilated cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome, or chronic heart failure were higher compared with controls. dilated cardiomyopathy, acute coronary syndrome, or chronic heart failure correlated to the severity of the diseases (335, 392). over-expression of Grx2 in myocardial mitochondria reduced infarct size (535) similar to Trx1, over-expression of Grx2 protected mice against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity. mice with the targeted disruption of the Nrx gene displayed several cardiovascular defects, for example, a ventricular septal defect and persistent truncus arteriosus (216). skin is exposed to several chemical and physical injuries. the skin is exposed to several chemical and physical injuries. skeletal muscle ROS and RNS are continuously generated in skeletal muscle cells and increased during contraction and fatigue (189, 267, 397). in older rats, skeletal muscles are the main sources of ROS and RNS generation (404). x1 was significantly increased in the synovial fluid of rheumatoid arthritis patients. Trx1 levels in synovial fluids from rheumatoid arthritis were significantly higher compared with those from osteoarthritis patients. inflammatory indicators in the serum and synovial fluid were correlated with inflammatory indicators. in the mature, adult lung, Trx1 and TrxR1 immunoreactivities were reported to be weak or moderate only in pneumocytes, macrophages, and bronchial epithelial cells (774). in the adult mouse and rat, only the mitochondrial Trx system along with the cytosolic peroxiredoxins, Prx2 and Prx6 were detected in pneumocytes. thma has an approximate prevalence of 5% of the worldwide population. inflammatory airway diseases such as asthma or COPD show altered ratios of GSH to GSSG (198, 617) and its biosynthesizing enzyme GCS (261, 618) an increase of GCS, especially in the epithelium, might be counter-regulation of ongoing inflammatory responses in pulmonary diseases (626) ous application of Trx1 and transgenic over-expression suppress asthmatic key features such as airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation. an intraperitoneal injection of recombinant human Trx 1 suppressed bleomycin-induced acute interstitial pneumonia in mice. an up-regulation of Trx1 and TrxR1 in epithelial cells was detected (251, 604) high expression of Prx1 and Prx3 in granulomas and alveolar macrophages of sarcoidosis parenchyma suggest a significant role in the control of the oxidant burden and the progression of lung injury. KO-mice of Prx2 displayed an increased asthmatic phenotype along with a decreased expression of the LPS-detecting TLR-4 (512). phagocytic cells of the innate immune system destroy pathogens via the NADPH oxidase-dependent formation of ROS. potential mechanisms killing pathogens involve changes in the phagosomal pH and ion concentrations as well as the inactivation of virulence factors. the authors hypothesized that DCs may activate T cells, which lack cystine transporters, by creating a reducing milieu in the immunological synapse, providing them with free thiols. this is especially important because intracellular GSH, which is generated from cysteine, is essential in the response to mitogenic and antigenic stimuli (491). the redox state of the individual proteins is believed to be rather oxidized than reduced. a few studies show that the latter can also be secreted by some cell types (23, 722) extracellular functions are not based on the reduction of disulfides, but rather the transfer of disulfides to target-soluble proteins. exogenous administered Trx1 was shown to induce expression of antioxidant genes. cytokine regulates NF-B activation induced by TNF-, phorbol myristate acetate or IL-1 (279, 757) a chemoattractant in the nanomolar range also depends on the redox-active cysteine residues. the third described function is a receptor- and G protein-independent process in monocytes, polymorphonuclear leukocytes, and T cells. higher chemokine levels potentially have the oppositional effect, leading to impaired leukocyte migration. only minor levels of Trx1 are located to the membrane (667) the truncated protein differs from the full-length protein because it lacks parts of the active site. both proteins share similar functions, such as proliferative effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and monocytes. Prx4 possesses a leader peptide and is processed and secreted from the cell via the ER and Golgi apparatus within minutes. it regulates H2O2-induced signaling pathways, for example, the H2O2-mediated activation of NF-B via modulation of the inhibitory protein IB. intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) facilitates cell-cell interactions and leukocyte transmigration into tissues. over-expression of Grx1 increases the secretion of IL6. other proposed functions include decomposition of peroxides via reduction of plasma GPx3. phosphatases DUSP4 and DUSP6 regulate MAP kinase signaling. parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida lack the eukaryotic (GSH)/GR and (Trx)/TrxR system. many bacterial and parasite-specific Trx systems have developed. extracellular TrxR and Trx can modulate the activity of the pore-forming cysteine-containing NK-lysin. extracellular Trx exerts differential regulatory functions on circulating immunoglobulins by reducing intermolecular disulfides between heavy and light chains. the cytoplasmic vaccinia virus encodes its own Grx. an unusual monothiol Grx has been found in the Chlorella virus PBCV-1 genome. the fact that it is expressed throughout the entire virus life cycle implies its importance in viral replication (197) an initial down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Trx allows a replication boost. subsequent up-regulation might reflect a way of inducing a persistent infection. innate immune mechanisms are further compromised by elevated Trx serum levels that impair CD4+ cell survival by blocking pathogen-induced chemotaxis. both Trx1 and Grx1 are already detectable by immunohistochemistry at E11.5. in contrast to Grx1, which is expressed continuously in the liver during the adult life, Trx1 expression was reported to decrease. both Trx1 and TrxR1 expression was affected in starving mice 260. both Trx1 and TrxR1 expression was affected in starving mice. lium harbors different populations of specialized cells. these hormone-secreting cells were found to be strongly stained for Trx2, TrxR2, Grx1, Grx2, Prx2, and Nrx in the mouse stomach epithelium (235) + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + mRNA and protein levels of Grx3 in colon cancer were the highest among several analyzed Grxs, Trxs, and Prxs. mRNA and protein levels of Grx3 in colon cancer were the highest among several analyzed. type-I or juvenile diabetes is an autoimmune disease (207) the immune system attacks pancreatic -cells, attenuating the synthesis and release of the hormone insulin into the portal vein. both conditions prohibit the regulation and cellular uptake of glucose and lead to hyperglycemia. tosolic Grx1 increased this effect, whereas Trx1 counteracted the secretion. the excitatory effects of NADPH depended on the expression of Grx1. ivirus-mediated over-expression in mice attenuated diabetes-related cardiac pathologies in diabetic hearts exposed to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). ivirus-mediated over-expression of recombinant Trx1 induced hematosis, infarct size, and had a positive impact on the overall cardiac function (849) development of diabetes induced in rats by streptozotocin led to a reduction in Trx2 mRNA in the aorta after 2 weeks. human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed around 20% reduced Trx2 mRNA levels. decreased intracellular levels or inactivation of Trx1 has been correlated with increased diabetes susceptibility. glucose-induced Txnip expression was associated with increased transcription of IL-1 and its precursor. it is not induced by the presence of fatty acids (117). it was actually the highest changing transcript in models of diabetes (623) transgenic mice over-expressing Prx3 were characterized by lower mitochondrial H2O2 concentrations and were protected against hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance (122). Prx4 over-expressing mice were generally less susceptible to streptozotocin-induced diabetes, showed less hyperglycemia and glucose tolerance. GPx, GR, and SOD (151, 416, 729) were also shown to be increased in healthy animals on exercise. exercise was shown to significantly increase Prx2 expression in obese type-2 diabetes patients. a regional strong distribution was observed for Grx2 and Prx3 in the cortex and the medulla. Prx2 and TrxR2 immunoreactivites were described as the strongest in glomeruli and renal connective tissue. in the human kidney, several Trxs and Prxs have been detected in glomeruli and tubule cells. receptors led to a decrease in Prx2 expression, implying a role of the peroxidase or rather increased H2O2 levels in angiotensin II-induced podocyte injury (304). in the urothelium, most Trx family proteins showed stronger immunoreactivities in the basal cells as compared with the superficial cells, where only Grx2 and Grx5 showed strong immunoreactivity (235). c and Grx2d Spermatogonia, spermatids Unlike Grx2c, Grx2b is inactive and does not form iron-sulfur cluster bridged dimers (310) human Grx2b and Grx2c Spermatids, Sertoli cells, cancer cells Unlike Grx2c, Grx2b does not form iron-sulfur cluster bridged dimers (310) the Trx fold proteins display a high variability in the testicular tissue. several testis-specific proteins have been detected in distinct cell types. in leydig cells, which function in the testosterone production, several proteins were strongly expressed. the invasiveness of human prostate carcinoma cells was shown to correlate to levels of ROS/RNS and the GSH/GSSG ratio. the majority of androgen-independent or hormone refractory prostate cancers expressing androgen receptors and Prx1\u20134 were up-regulated, regulating the receptor's activity. a low cytoplasmic expression of Trx correlated significantly with better progression-free survival (824) in ovarian carcinomas, cytoplasmic Prx4 expression was associated with a better prognosis. cytoplasmic Prx5 and 6 were associated with a higher stage (370) cells have developed response mechanisms to cope with low oxygen concentrations. hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF 1 and 2 constitute transcription factors that regulate the expression of more than 180 genes under hypoxic conditions. nitric oxide is involved in the regulation of HIF-1, either by inhibiting HIF-1 activation (725) or by stabilizing and increasing the levels of the active HIF-1 subunit and the DNA binding capacity of HIF-1. nitric oxide is involved in the regulation of HIF-1, either by inhibiting HIF-1 activation (725) authors hypothesize that down-regulation of Txnip is essential for cancer cells. tumor hypoxia correlating to poor prognosis, increased tumor growth, and resistance to drug and radiation therapy. many Trx family proteins show distinct expression patterns in cancer. NF-B-activation, and induction of apoptosis can be prevented by over-expressing the peroxidase, resulting in reduced hypoxia-induced cell death and neuroprotection. recombinant Trx1 protected retinal ischemia-reperfusion injury in rats. members of the Trx family have been described to protect against ischemic injuries. increased levels of Trx1, Grx1, Grx2, and Prx2 by either over-expression or treatment attenuated ischemic damage of neurons (70, 752, 868) and cardiac cells (426, 464, 535, 768, 829) compared with wildtype organs, knockout hearts showed reduced recovery of left ventricular function, increased myocardial infarct size, and elevated levels of apoptotic cardiomyocytes (534). we have recently analyzed the expression of 16 Trx-related proteins in a mouse model for renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, revealing nephron segment-specific responses of Trx family proteins to the ischemic insult. x2, Prx3, and Prx6 were significantly increased in proximal tubule cells (236), a cell type that is characterized by the ability to regenerate after an I/R insult (511, 553) over-expression of these proteinss in HeLa and HEK293 cells attenuated oxidative damage to the DNA and led to a higher cell survival and proliferation rate. cold-adapted cells were exposed to 0\u00b0C, followed by a rewarming period. hypothermal preconditioning can be compared with general IPC. resistance to I/R damage is induced by exposing a tissue to several ischemic episodes (516) essentially all of these cellular functions are at some level controlled by redox signaling. it comes as no surprise that Trx family members play a pivotal role in the process of carcinogenesis. many aspects of the potential role of Trx protein family members have been extensively reviewed. two nonmitochondrial Grx2 isoforms, Grx2b and Grx2c, are generated. expression in humans could so far only be demonstrated in testis and various tumor cells (447) many cancer cells showed increased levels of Prxs. denham Harman proposed the so-called \u201cfree radical theory of aging\u201d. he proposed the so-called \u201cfree radical theory of aging\u201d depicting the production and over-time accumulation of ROS. the special contribution of mitochondria was demonstrated later in 1972 (263) mutations in various genes that interfere with the aging process have been characterized. these encode for proteins functioning either in the regulation of energy use or in redox regulation and signaling, including catalase (770) and Prx (194, 775). mutator mouse expresses a proofreading-deficient mitochondrial DNA polymerase. this leads to the accumulation of point mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. this phenotype was shown not to be associated with significant increased levels of ROS or a cellular anti-stress response. the expression of proteins of the Trx family was shown to be important. protein deficiency is correlated with severe and often fatal phenotypes. the expression of proteins of the Trx family was also shown to be important. apoptosis at the onset of respiration; open anterior neural tube (552) TRXR1 Thioredoxin reductase 1 Yes, E9.5\u201310.5 Reduced proliferation; reduced body size; cerebellar hypoplasia (332, 552) TRXR2 Thioredoxin reductase 2 Yes, E13.5\u201315.5 Reduced in size; anemic; reduced hematopoiesis; thinning of the ventricular myo Nrx knockout mice show skeletal and cardiovascular defects and die around birth. Nrx interacts with dishevelled to regulate both Wnt/-catenin and Wnt/planar cell polarity pathways during embryogenesis. Nrx also regulates via an interaction with Flightless-1 (Fli-1) TLR-4 signaling. reduced Nrx can inhibit TLR4 signaling, which is essential for embryonic development and the innate immune response. reduced Nrx binds to Flightless-1 (Fli-1), forming an inhibitory complex with Myd88, suppressing TLR4-signaling. indicators of ROS-induced damage have been reported in the three most widespread neurodegenerative diseases. PD (17, 146, 152, 684), AD (525, 620), and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) (40, 188) Prx2 is highly expressed in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of rats and humans (26, 143). in the mouse CNS, Trx2 was specifically detected in axonal fibers in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and white matters of the cerebellum and spinal cord. this observation may imply more specific functions of Trx2 independently of its reductase. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. n. ++ n.a. n.a. ++* ++a n.a. ++* n.a. ++* n.a. ++* n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. n.a. ++a ++a ++a + ++ n.a. +a + n.a. +a + + + + + + ++* + ++* + n.a. ++a ++a ++a x ++ n.a. +a + n.a. +a + + + + + + + ++* + n.a. ++a ++a ++a x ++ n.a. +a + ++ Trx1 and Grx1 were prominently detected in the folliculo-stellatae cells of the adenohypophysis. only a minor proportion of the glandular cells were stained. in the pituicytes and the clusters of synaptic terminals, Trx1 was intensely stained. 3, Prx3, Prx5, Nrx, and Trx1 were notably expressed in the ependymal cells of the cerebral ventricles. active secretion of Trx1 was reported for a variety of cells (655), and increased Trx1 plasma levels have been detected in many diseases. 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), an active metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), causes Parkinsonism (36). over-expression of Trx1 attenuated MPP+-induced neurotoxicity of PC12 cells (36) treatment of rat primary hippocampal neurons with TrxR1 attenuated amyloid -mediated toxicity (450) in Alzheimer's patients, TrxR1 activity was generally enhanced compared with controls (450), whereas TrxR1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of multiple sclerosis patients were decreased (592). de-/glutathionylation, specifically catalyzed by Grxs, is associated with several aspects of neurodegeneration, such as apoptosis, mitochondrial function, and plaque formation. the loss of GSH is one of the first signs of the disease (597, 598) whereas silencing of Prx1 sensitized the cells (315, 423) in whole brain samples, the expression levels of Prx1 and Prx2 were elevated in Alzheimer's patients (406, 746) in whole brain samples, the expression levels of Prx1 and Prx2 were increased in the hippocampus and frontal cortex of AD patients (746) the protection of Prx2 against neuroinflammation via suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in microglia (556) may be helpful to combat these diseases. a. expression profile of Trxs, Grxs, Prxs, and related proteins in the CNS Cells of the nervous system are particularly susceptible to oxidative damage due to their high oxygen consumption. Prx1 immunoreactivity was detected in oligodendrocytes in several regions of the brain. in the mouse CNS, Trx2 was specifically detected in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and white matters of the cerebellum and spinal cord. this observation may imply more specific functions of Trx2 independently of its reductase. kinje cells Granular layer Mol. layer Plexus coroideus ProteinSpecies M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R H M R R H M R R H M R R H M R R H M R R H M R R H M R R ++ n.a. n.a. n.a. ++ n.a. n.a. ++ n.a. n.a. ++ n.a. n.a. ++ n.a. n.a. ++ n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. n.a. ++* n.a. ++* n.a. ++* n.a. + ++ ++* + + +* + ++ ++* + n.a. ++ ++a ++a x ++ n.a. +a ++a ++a n.a. +a ++a + + + + + + ++* + n.a. ++a ++a x ++ n strong nuclear staining; x, axonal staining; n, neurofilaments; n, neurofilaments; GR, glutathione reductase; Nrx, nucleoredoxin; Prx, peroxiredoxin; d, dendrites; n, neurofilaments; n, neurofilaments; d, dendrites; GR, glutathione reductase; GR, some of the Trx-related redox proteins were detected in areas of the central nervous system where active secretion takes place. some of the proteins (i.e., Grx1, Prx1, and Nrx) were abundantly present in both the gray and white matter. other, such as Trx2, showed a clear regional distribution, being most notably expressed in the white matter. rat pheochromocytoma cell line was suppressed in a rat pheochromocytoma cell line (PC12) after treatment with 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), an active metabolite of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), which causes Parkinsonism (36). over-expression of Trx1 attenuated MPP+-induced neurotoxicity treatment of rat primary hippocampal neurons with TrxR1 attenuated amyloid -mediated toxicity (450) in Alzheimer's patients, TrxR1 activity was generally enhanced compared with controls (450), whereas TrxR1 levels in the cerebrospinal fluid and blood of multiple sclerosis patients were decreased (592) x2 protected against apoptosis (191) after induction of focal ischemia in rat brains, Grx1 levels decreased parallel to the rate of neuronal damage (752) in Alzheimer's brain tissue, Grx1 was up-regulated in healthy neurons of the hippocampus and the frontal cortex, but down-regulated in degenerating neurons. oxidation of Prx1 and Prx2 protected dopaminergic cells in vitro and in vivo against 6-OHDA-induced apoptosis. increased Prx2 levels protected dopaminergic cells against amyloid toxicity in a transgenic mouse model for AD (847) inflammation is known to be a characteristic for several neurological diseases such as multiple sclerosis, ALS, and PD. protection of Prx2 against neuroinflammation via suppression of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways in microglia (556) may be helpful to combat these diseases. inner segment of the photoreceptors is rich in mitochondria and was intensely stained for Grx1, Grx5, Prx5, Trx2 and TrxR2. an eye-specific Trx-like protein, the rod-derived cone viability factor, was detected in photoreceptor outer segments and the interphotoreceptor matrix (428). the outermost layer of the retina functions in photoreceptor nourishment and contributes to the formation of the blood-retinal barrier (162). x6 showed intense nuclear staining patterns in the outermost layer of the olfactory epithelium. x6 also appeared distributed in the olfactory nerve bundles (arrows) grx5 immunoreactivity was the strongest of all analyzed proteins in the lens fibers. most Trxs, Grxs, and Prxs have been observed in the stratified squamous epithelium of the mouse tongue. retinopathy and AMD are associated with hypertension-induced oxidative stress and inflammation, causing loss of vision. formation of cataracts, opaque areas of the lens, is mainly based on oxidative stress that is induced by intrinsic factors such as hypertension. over-expression of Trx1 suppressed reduction of photoreceptors and the apoptosis induced by high light exposure in mice retina. decreased levels of Txnip attenuated early signs of diabetic retinopathy (595) and Txnip expression levels increased after IOP (528) over-expression of Trx2 in the retina and the optic nerve attenuated degeneration after intra-ocular pressure (526, 527). over-expression of Prx5 in Xenopus embryos reduced alcohol-induced eye malformation. over-expression of Prx6 attenuated hypoxia-induced retinal ganglion cell death (784), and treatment of retinal ganglion cells with Prx6 decreased glutamate and TNF-induced cell death. levels of Trx1 positively correlated with respiratory disturbance in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. several anticancer drugs induce ototoxicity. cisplatin is strongly ototoxic to cochlea hair cells in guinea pig model. Trx1 and TrxR1 expression was also demonstrated in neurons and photoreceptor cells in the developing rat retina (259). in adult rats, Trx1 was detected in the outer and inner plexiform layers with especially strong expression in the ganglionar cell layer but only faint staining in the photoreceptors. despite the high melanin content in the retinal pigmented epithelium, Nrx staining in this layer is evident. despite the high melanin content in the retinal pigmented epithelium, Nrx staining in this layer is evident. Trx1 and Prx5 appear homogenously distributed within the cells. grx5 and Nrx immunoreactivities appear to be concentrated in specific areas of the cells, that is, the apical pole for Grx5 and the lateral sides for Nrx. eactivities for both Trx1 and TrxR1 were seen in epithelial cells, glands, and vascular endothelium of human nasal mucosa and nasal polyps (421) in the cochlea of guinea pigs, TrxR1 was expressed in the inner and outer hair cells of the organ of Corti as well as in the lateral wall and the neurons of spiral ganglion (275). glaucoma is one of the leading over-expression of Trx1 attenuated cell death after IOP (526) administration of N-methyl-D-aspartate to mammalian eyes stimulated glutamate receptors and induced retinal damage. an intravitreous injection of Trx1 effectively attenuated NMDA-induced retinal cell damage. plasma and whole blood of patients with AMD displayed reduced levels of the total GSH pool and increased the GSH/GSSG redox potential. in patients with diabetic retinopathy, Prx1 was increased in the vitreous (219) over-expression of Prx5 in Xenopus embryos reduced alcohol-induced eye malformation, indicating that Prx5 might be involved in protection against alcohol-induced fetal ocular injury (590). over-expression of Prx6 delayed development of cataracts in rat and mouse lenses (410). no significant change of expression of Trx1 and TrxR1 was detected in nasal polyps compared with normal human nasal mucosa (421) levels of Trx1 were positively correlated with respiratory disturbance in patients with obstructive sleep apnea. a mutation in the same gene region was determined as a reason for hearing loss in the pirouette mouse mutant (557). a mutation in the same gene region was determined as a reason for hearing loss in the pirouette mouse mutant (557). both Trx1 and TrxR1 were detected in the heart and great vessels of the mouse embryo. nitration of Trx1 (769) as detected in diabetic (849) and aged hearts (864) mice with cardiac-specific over-expression of wildtype Trx1 were protected against hypertrophy. mice with cardiac-specific over-expression of wildtype Trx1 displayed cardiac hypertrophy. over-expression of human Trx1 in mouse hearts conferred protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (707) doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is one of the most effective drugs in the treatment of several types of cancers. however, its therapeutic use is limited due to its high cardiotoxicity (873) inflammatory cell infiltration in rats (829), diminished severity of myocarditis (442), and protected against reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in isolated rat hearts (27). inflammatory cell infiltration in rats (829), decreased severity of myocarditis (442), and protected against reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in isolated rat hearts (27). t size in coronary occlusion/reperfusion models of heart infarction (464) no role of Grx1 in this animal model was identified (301). over-expression of Grx2 in myocardial mitochondria reduced infarct size (535) mice lacking Prx6 were more susceptible to ischemia-reperfusion injury. neither mice with elevated Prx6 levels nor those with reduced Prx6 levels yielded hints for an involvement of this protein in the development of atherosclerosis. the anti-apoptotic functions of Trx1 are related to its role in protecting cardiac tissue against ischemia/reperfusion injury. this function is inhibited by nitration of Trx1 (769) as detected in diabetic (849) and aged hearts (864). in contrast, S-nitrosylation of Trx1 increases protective effects (767) over-expression of human Trx1 in mouse hearts conferred protection against doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity (707) doxorubicin (Adriamycin) is one of the most effective drugs in the treatment of several types of cancers; its therapeutic use is limited due to its high cardiotoxicity (873) treatment with human recombinant Trx1 attenuated several pathological processes affecting the cardiovascular system. it attenuated cardiac hypertrophy in aged mice (9), reduced infarct size after reperfusion in mice and rats (768, 829), lowered inflammatory cell infiltration in rats (829), diminished severity of myocarditis (442) and protected against reperfusion-induced arrhythmias in isolated rat hearts (27). grx1 knockout inhibited functional recovery and increased infarct size in coronary occlusion/reperfusion models of heart infarction (464) over-expression of Grx2 in cardiomyocytes inhibited cardiac hypertrophy induced by treatment with enthothelin-1 and phenylephrine (337). Prx2 deficiency suppressed angiogenesis during tumor development. in mice over-expressing Prx3, cardiac failure after myocardial infarction was inhibited. a similar phenotype was observed in mice lacking Prx6 knockout mice. um corneum (i.e., stratum granulosum, stratum spinosum, and stratum basale) were uniformly and strongly stained for Grx2, Grx5, Nrx, Prx3, Prx4, Prx6, and Trx1. in the epidermal cells of the human skin, Trx1 and TrxR1_v3 were strongly expressed; mitochondrial Trx2 displayed low or no staining (143). the cytosolic Trx system seemed to be more implicated in rheumatoid arthritis than in osteoarthritis. Trx1 levels in synovial fluids from rheumatoid arthritis were significantly higher compared with those from osteoarthritis. in fetal mice, Trx1 and Grx1 were detected in the epithelial cells of the airway (future bronchial and alveolar epithelia) and the lung parenchyme at E13.5, increasing at later developmental stages (396) in the adult mouse and rat, only the mitochondrial Trx system along with the cytosolic peroxiredoxins, Prx2 and Prx6, were detected in pneumocytes. in the upper respiratory tract of the mouse, only Prx6 was highly expressed in the pseudostratified epithelium of the trachea. a direct correlation between oxidative damage as a fundamental consequence of characteristic-reversible airway obstruction and airway hyperresponsiveness was found. high concentrations of circulating Trx1 were found in infectious and inflammatory diseases, inhibiting monocyte and neutrophil responses to chemokines by acting downstream of the chemokine receptors eotaxin and CCR3 (538, 564). in patients, Trx serum concentrations correlated with increasing serum eosinophil cationic protein concentrations and were conversely proportionate to the expiratory peak flow rate during asthmatic attacks (835). an ovalbumin-induced murine model of allergic airway disease, an increased amount of Grx1 and total Grx-activity was detected (636) it functions not only as a mere ROS scavenger in the Th2-driven asthmatic phenotype, but also by suppressing the IL4 cytokine. KO-mice of Prx2 displayed an increased asthmatic phenotype along with a decreased expression of the LPS-detecting TLR-4 (512) in fetal mice, Trx1 and Grx1 were detected in the epithelial cells of the airway (future bronchial and alveolar epithelia) and the lung parenchyme at E13.5, increasing at later developmental stages (396). in the human lung, Trx1 is detected from week 35 onward and is located in the bronchial epithelium. only the mitochondrial Trx system along with the cytosolic peroxiredoxins, Prx2 and Prx6 were detected in pneumocytes. in the upper respiratory tract of the mouse, only Prx6 was highly expressed in the pseudostratified epithelium of the trachea. high concentrations of circulating Trx1 were found in infectious and inflammatory diseases, inhibiting monocyte and neutrophil responses to chemokines by acting downstream of the chemokine receptors eotaxin and CCR3 (538, 564) in patients, Trx serum concentrations correlated with increasing serum eosinophil cationic protein concentrations. the expression in sarcoidosis and allergic alveolitis patient samples is decreased. an increased amount of Grx1 and total Grx-activity was detected (636) it functions as a mere ROS scavenger in the Th2-driven asthmatic phenotype. some Trx-related proteins showed more intense immunoreactivities in defined areas. a difference in subcellular localization in both zones was reported. the expression of 16 Trx family proteins has been described. potential mechanisms killing pathogens involve changes in the phagosomal pH and ion concentrations as well as the inactivation of virulence factors. ROS can activate an increased immune response via redox-sensitive signaling pathways, including, for example, NF-B-activation and expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1 and TNF- (494, 687) intracellular GSH, which is generated from cysteine, is essential in the response to mitogenic and antigenic stimuli (491) this is also valid in the case of polymorphonuclear leukocytes, reviewed in (780). a few studies show that the latter can also be secreted by some cell types (23, 722). T cells secrete detectable levels of Trx1 when activated by specific compounds. exogenous administered Trx1 was also shown to act as a cytokine or chemokine. the injection of recombinant Trx1 in a rat model for myocardial ischemia significantly reduced the number of infiltrating immune cells. the anti-inflammatory function could be explained by regulating or rather inhibiting the macrophage migration inhibitor factor, a pro-inflammatory protein released from immune cells. the truncated Trx80 comprises the N-terminal first 80\u201384 amino acids of the cytosolic Trx1. it was detected in human B and T lymphocytes, monocytes, granulocytes, and melanomas (667) only minor levels of Trx1 are located to the membrane (667) Prx1 and Prx2 are also known under the name \u201cnatural killer cell enhancing factors A and B\u201d because they increase the cytotoxicity of natural killer cells. the secreted form is potentially enzymatically active and might act in scavenging extracellular ROS or regulating biological processes via binding heparan sulfate attached to cell surfaces. peltoniemi et al. showed that alveolar macrophages expressed Grx1 and that Grx1 levels were decreased in homogenates of the lung and increased in the sputum of patients with COPD. over-expression of Grx1 in HEK293 cells led to increased TNF--and PMA-induced NF-B activation. grx3 over-expressing RBL-2H3 cells were characterized by increased degranulation, elevated activation of the transcription factor NFAT and the expression of IL-4 and TNF-. no changes in the phosphorylation state of ERK and NF-B activation imply new functions in FcRI-mediated mast cell activation. trypanosomatids contain parasite-specific tryparedoxin/trypanothione. but also prominent levels of GSH and various monothiol and dithiol Grxs. extracellular TrxR and Trx exerts differential regulatory functions on circulating immunoglobulins. the cytoplasmic vaccinia virus encodes its own Grx. an unusual monothiol Grx has been found in the PBCV-1 genome. it is relevant for DNA replication as a subunit of the T7 bacteriophage DNA polymerase. ostasis affects host susceptibility and progression of many diseases such as cancer, neurodegenerative diseases, cystic fibrosis, and human immunodeficient virus (HIV) (780). GSH levels of HIV-infected individuals and in AIDS patients are depleted in plasma, epithelial lining fluid, PBMCs, and monocytes. blocking antibodies could reduce disulfide-dependent HIV-1 entry. cytosolic Trx system has been detected in lymphoid cells of human lymph nodes. expression of 16 Trx family proteins in lymphoid tissues. phagocytic cells of the innate immune system destroy pathogens via the NADPH oxidase-dependent formation of ROS. potential mechanisms killing pathogens involve changes in the phagosomal pH and ion concentrations as well as the inactivation of virulence factors. the adaptive immunity is established by antibody-producing B cells and T cells. it depends on the binding of the T-cell receptor to a peptide bound to the major histocompatibility complex on antigen-presenting cells. however, in the presence of ROS-scavenging enzymes, T cells lose their ability to respond to cytokine- or receptor-mediated signaling. the redox state of the individual proteins is believed to be rather oxidized than reduced. a few studies show that the latter can also be secreted by some cell types. cellular Trx1 was shown to act as a cytokine or chemokine. exogenous administered Trx1 was shown to act as a cytokine or chemokine. the anti-inflammatory function could be explained by regulating the macrophage migration inhibitor factor. the third described function as a chemoattractant in the nanomolar range also depends on the redox-active cysteine residues. the truncated Trx80 comprises the N-terminal first 80\u201384 amino acids of the cytosolic Trx1 and was originally described as an eosinophil cytotoxicity-enhancing factor. the truncated protein is not a substrate for TrxR. it lacks parts of the active site and does not exhibit oxidoreductase activity (587) both proteins share similar functions, such as proliferative effects on peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Prx4 possesses a leader peptide and is processed and secreted from the cell via the ER and Golgi apparatus within minutes. it regulates H2O2-induced signaling pathways, for example, the H2O2-mediated activation of NF-B via modulation of the inhibitory protein IB. cytosolic Grx1 was demonstrated in the extracellular compartment. over-expression of Grx1 increases the secretion of IL6. other proposed functions include decomposition of peroxides via reduction of plasma GPx3. IL-8, IL receptor 4, or dual-specific phosphatases DUSP4 and DUSP6 regulate MAP kinase signaling (unpublished data, P. Haunhorst and C.H. Lillig). parasitic protozoa of the order Kinetoplastida lack the eukaryotic (GSH)/GR and (Trx)/TrxR system. extracellular TrxR and Trx can modulate the activity of the pore-forming cysteine-containing NK-lysin. extracellular Trx exerts differential regulatory functions on circulating immunoglobulins. the potent antimicrobial peptide human -defensin 1 is activated by Trx (688) a vast number of inhibitors was developed to trigger lethal effects. Species-specific Grxs function in viral DNA biosynthesis when levels of the corresponding host cell proteins are depleted. cytoplasmic vaccinia virus encodes its own Grx. an initial down-regulation of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Trx allows a replication boost. subsequent up-regulation might reflect a way of inducing a persistent infection. innate immune mechanisms are further compromised by elevated Trx serum levels that impair CD4+ cell survival by blocking pathogen-induced chemotaxis. both Trx1 and Grx1 are already detectable by immunohistochemistry at E11.5. in contrast to Grx1, which is expressed continuously in the liver during the adult life, Trx1 expression was reported to decrease (396) both Trx1 and TrxR1 expression was affected in starving mice (260). both Trx1 and TrxR1 expression was affected in endocrine and exocrine cells. the most evident staining pattern has been observed in the enteroendocrine cells. these hormone-secreting cells were strongly stained for Trx2, TrxR2, Grx1, Grx2, Prx2, and Nrx in the mouse stomach epithelium (235) + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + mRNA and protein levels of Grx3 in colon cancer were the highest among several analyzed Grxs, Trxs, and Prxs. mRNA and protein levels of Grx3 in colon cancer were the highest among several analyzed. mellitus is an increasing health issue with 220 million cases worldwide. the immune system attacks pancreatic -cells, attenuating the synthesis and release of the hormone insulin into the portal vein. type-II diabetes arises from constant glucose uptake and emerging insulin resistance. -cells progressively die from metabolic stress (721) cytosolic Grx1 increased this effect, whereas Trx1 counteracted the secretion (329). the excitatory effects of NADPH depended on the expression of Grx1 (632). lentivirus-mediated over-expression in mice attenuated diabetes-related cardiac pathologies in diabetic hearts exposed to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R). over-expression of recombinant Trx1 in models for type-I and type-II diabetes minimized cellular damage and improved the survival of -cells. development of diabetes induced in rats by streptozotocin led to a reduction in Trx2 mRNA in the aorta after 2 weeks. human umbilical vein endothelial cells showed around 20% reduced Trx2 mRNA levels. decreased intracellular levels or inactivation of Trx1 has been correlated with increased diabetes susceptibility. xnip has been shown to be dramatically induced by glucose. it is p38 dependent and mediated via inhibition of the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway during hyperglycemia (690), suppressed by insulin (700), and strongly up-regulated in diabetic animal models and patients. transgenic mice over-expressing Prx3 were characterized by lower mitochondrial H2O2 concentrations and were protected against hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance (122). Prx4 over-expressing mice were generally less susceptible to streptozotocin-induced diabetes, showed less hyperglycemia and glucose tolerance, down-regulation of various inflammatory-related proteins. diabetes mellitus is an increasing health issue with 220 million cases worldwide. the immune system attacks pancreatic -cells, attenuating the synthesis and release of the hormone insulin into the portal vein. ly altered mitochondria, attenuating ATP production, glucose-dependent insulin secretion and potentially lead to apoptosis and -cell mass reduction, reviewed in 483, 851. ly altered mitochondria, attenuating ATP production, glucose-dependent insulin secretion and possibly lead to apoptosis. the expression of GR is especially high in islets and inhibition of the enzyme sensitizes -cells to streptozotocin-induced diabetes (533). over-expression of Grx1 via gene therapy, that is, lentivirus-mediated over-expression in mice, attenuated diabetes-related cardiac pathologies in diabetic hearts exposed to ischemia-reperfusion (426). myocardial over-expression of Trx1 induced heme oxygenase (HO)-1, VEGF, and p38 MAPK- expression. decreased levels of phosphorylated p38 MAPK- and JNK, and reduced overall apoptosis rate of cardiomyocytes and endothelial cells. oxidoreductase sensitives streptozotocin-induced diabetic mouse hearts to myocardial I/R injury (849) a genetic analysis revealed distinct Trx1 polymorphisms correlating with the development of diabetes (319) the endogenous inhibitor of Trx1 has gained a lot of attention in the diabetes field. down-regulation of Prx3 in rat insulinoma cells led to insufficient insulin secretion. over-expression protected the cells against various agents, including H2O2, NO, proinflammatory cytokines, and the -cell toxin streptozotocin (820). transgenic mice over-expressing Prx3 were generally less susceptible to streptozotocin-induced diabetes. lentivirus vector coding for Trx1 was shown to be resistant to inflammatory processes and prolonged islet survival after transplantation. regular exercise is a preventive and therapeutic strategy against diabetes. exercise was shown to increase Prx2 expression in obese type-2 diabetes patients. Txnip mRNA and protein levels were, in contrast to Trx1, most abundantly expressed in the glomeruli and in the distal nephron of rats and human kidneys. a regional strong distribution was also observed for Grx2 and Prx3 in the cortex and the medulla. angiotensin II treatment and podocyte-specific over-expression of angiotensin II type-1 receptors led to a decrease in Prx2 expression. in rats, angiotensin II treatment and podocyte-specific over-expression of angiotensin II type-1 receptors led to a decrease in Prx2 expression. TXNDC2/Sp-Trx1 may also play a role in disulfide formation. whereas TXNDC8/Sp-Trx3 seems to regulate proteins via post-translational modifications, controlling germ-cell-specific functions. the seminiferous tubules of the testis show a high of rate cell division. the Trx fold proteins display a high variability in the testicular tissue. the testis-specific proteins are present in these tubules in mice. invasiveness of human prostate carcinoma cells correlates to levels of ROS/RNS and the GSH/GSSG ratio. the majority of androgen-independent or hormone refractory prostate cancers expressing androgen receptors and Prx1\u20134 were up-regulated. in calf, Trx1, but not Grx1, was demonstrated immunohistochemically in follicular cells in the ovary. a low cytoplasmic expression of Trx correlated significantly with better progression-free survival (824) in ovarian carcinomas, cytoplasmic Prx4 expression was associated with a better prognosis. xtaglomerular cells suggest functions in the renin-angiotensin system (653) in sham-operated mice, Trx1 showed strong immunoreactivity in the cortex, but weak staining in the medulla. the same expression pattern was observed while analyzing Trx1 mRNA and protein in rat and human kidneys. the clinical involvement of Trx family proteins in the kidney has been analyzed in renal ischemia and reperfusion (236, 372); see section II.B.11, in diabetic nephropathy (7, 256) and in angiotensin II-induced podocyte injury (304). the Trx system seems to play a role in the progression of diabetic nephropathy because the over-expression of Trx1 in mice led to the suppression of pathophysiological changes after streptozo selenoproteins GPx4 and TrxR3/TGR function in disulfide-dependent sperm formation (549, 744, 794), thereby being essential for fertility. TXNDC8/Sp-Trx3 seems to regulate proteins via post-translational modifications, controlling germ-cell-specific functions. snGPx Spermatocytes and early spermatids Restricted to late stages of spermatogenesis (515) Prx4 31kda Membrane bound in the elongating spermatid and the residual body Acrosome formation during vesicular reorganization in spermiogenesis (558, 679) in early spermatids, Grx2 staining is characterized by a cup-like pattern capping the nucleus (235, 309) further analyses will have to define the localization of Grx2 in this cellular stadium. in elongated spermatids, Prx5 and Trx2 were highly expressed in the mitochondrial rich tail region. several members of the Trx family of proteins have been identified in the stroma and follicles cells of the mouse ovary as well as in the oviduct (235), with the highest expression detected for Trx1 and TrxR2. in calf, Trx1, but not Grx1, was demonstrated immunohistochemically in follicular cells in the ovary. hypoxia regulates the survival and promotes proliferation and differentiation of some cell types, including neural crest stem cells (518) and CNS precursors (742). the same is valid for placental development (3). nitric oxide is involved in the regulation of HIF-1, either by inhibiting HIF-1 activation (725) or by stabilizing and increasing the levels of the active HIF-1 subunit and the DNA binding capacity of HIF-1. nitric oxide is involved in the regulation of HIF-1, either by inhibiting HIF-1 activation (725) or by stabilizing and increasing the levels of the active HIF-1 subunit. kinase pathways represent cellular mechanisms to cope with altered O2 levels. over-expression of Trx1 led to elevated HIF-1 levels in cells cultured under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. inhibition of TrxR1 activity blocked the activation of HIF-1 (513) ck-down of Prx1 protein levels in lung carcinoma cell lines generally impaired cell growth. transplantation of xenografts into nude mice resulted in delayed formation of tumors and metastasis and higher sensitivity toward irradiation therapy. authors speculate that Prx6 could be used in the clinic. ischemia-reperfusion injury induces molecular and cellular changes, affecting cell morphology, cell polarity, osmoregulation, protein synthesis, and, for example, in the brain, release of neurotransmitters. ischemia-reperfusion injury induces molecular and cellular changes, affecting cell morphology, cell polarity, osmoregulation, protein synthesis. pretreatment of rat donor lungs with Trx1 decreased tissue rejection, due to inhibition of I/R injury, NF-B activation, and the inflammatory response (312). Moreover, over-expression of Prx5 was shown to be induced by I/R in transplanted organs. an analysis of contralateral kidneys revealed increased Grx5 and Prx6 levels and decreased protein levels of TrxR2, Prx4 and Prx5. the differences contribute to the distinct susceptibilities of different parts of the nephron toward the I/R insult. the glomeruli and the inner medulla cells have been described to be very resistant. hypothermia reduces ROS levels (99), NF-B activation, and inflammation (806). in a proteomic approach, 1089 proteins were shown to be differently expressed in human coronary artery endothelial cells when cultured at 25\u00b0C, compared with at 37\u00b0C. translocation of Trx1 by shRNA in rat hearts diminished cardioprotective effects of preconditioning. IPC also induced production of NO, increased mitochondrial function, and altered expression levels of various proteins, including mitochondrial SOD. mice transgenically over-expressing human Trx1 do not show an increase in malignant diseases; instead, their life expectancy is increased. the redox state of these residues appears to be regulated by both Ref-1 and Trx. in yeast, TrxR mutants failed to induce p53-dependent gene activation. 158), Prx2 in acute myeloid leukemia (10), and Prx4 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (568) c-Myc-mediated transformation was inhibited, implying a tumor suppressor role for Prx1 (163, 531). c-Myc-mediated transformation was inhibited, implying a tumor suppressor role for Prx1 (163, 531) the redox state of these residues appears to be regulated by both Ref-1 and Trx. the redox state of the tumor suppressor p53 is controlled by the redox state of some critical cysteinyl side chains in its DNA-binding domain. in yeast, TrxR mutants failed to induce p53-dependent gene activation. epigenetic down-regulation has been demonstrated for Prx1 in 1p/19q-deleted oligodendroglial tumors (158), Prx2 in acute myeloid leukemia (10), and Prx4 in acute promyelocytic leukemia (568). c-Myc-mediated transformation was inhibited, implying a tumor suppressor role for Prx1 (163, 531) caloric restriction was shown to enhance the lifespan in a wide range of organisms from yeast to mammals (194, 472) studies in distinct cell and animal models have demonstrated an age-related increase in the intracellular ROS levels (134, 726), mitochondrial dysfunction (427, 635, 680), accumulation of oxidative-damaged mitochondrial (192, 834) and nuclear DNA (50), oxidized lipids, and protein-mixed disulfides (68, 628) the absence of individual genes or proteins not always leads to a life-shortening phenotype. the contribution of ROS to organismic changes is highly controversial (574) despite all this supporting evidence, the contribution of ROS to organismic changes is highly controversial. oxidative changes are distinctly redox couple-, subcellular compartment-, and tissue-specific. oxidative changes are distinctly redox couple-, subcellular compartment-, and tissue-specific. new findings show age-dependent pro-oxidants were not equally distributed throughout the organism. increased levels of Trx1 in HIV-infected patients have been correlated with a reduced immune response, increased progression of the infection, and early mortality rate (543). a specific secretion of the oxidoreductase into urine has to be confirmed in patients; but might be applied as a marker for renal I/R injury in the future (236). specific auto antibodies against Trx-related proteins could be used as diagnostic markers. numerous inhibitors have been developed to counteract infectious diseases. for example, ebselen, a \u201cchemical mimic of GPx,\u201d was analyzed as a potential drug, for example, for cerebral ischemia (579) and stroke (836). a strategy might be developed to specifically target Prxs in cancer cells. pretreatment or preconditioning of rat donor lungs with cytosolic oxidoreductase abolished tissue rejection (312) and transfection of mouse donor pancreatic -cells with a Trx1 lentivirus vector extended cell survival after transplantation (131). Interestingly, Trx also bears functions in reducing allergenicity to, for example, milk by reduction of its major whey protein -lactoglobulin (756, 796) the redox modifications are highly target- and site specific. the redox systems are pivotal players in redox signal transduction. these events might have to be defined individually for each tissue, each cell type within.
