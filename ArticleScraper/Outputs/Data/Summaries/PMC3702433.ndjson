{"summary": "the patterns of aetiological pathogens vary by region and country. the study is to determine the incidence, aetiological pathogens, clinical pictures and risk factors of community-acquired pneumonia in the adult population. 357 samples tested for viral PCR, 73 (21%) were positive for respiratory viruses; influenza A (n = 32, 9%) was the most common. the current adult CAP incidence in Vietnam was relatively low; this result was mostly attributed to the young age of our study population. population and hospital Nha Trang is the capital city of the Khanh Hoa Province. temperatures are high throughout the year (average 26\u00b0C) and the rainy season is from September through December. TI if presenting to the hospital with at least two of the following symptoms: fever and/or cough (2) fast and/or difficulty of breathing, or (3) any additional severe symptoms including respiratory rate over 30 per minute, SpO2 under 90%, systolic blood pressure under 90 mmHg, pulse rate more than 130/min, white blood cell count over 20,000 or under 4,000 cells/L, CRP over 20 mg/dl, dehydrated, altered consciousness and other worse general status. Residual sputum samples and VTM were stored at 80\u00b0C in the hospital laboratory and transported on ice pack to the Institute of Tropical Medicine. sputum samples were tested by multiplex PCR, which is a conventional PCR with mixing three sets of pathogen specific primers. the cases of hospitalised ICD-10 coded pneumonia were defined by ICD-10 codes J10\u2013J18 (ICD-10 coded pneumonia) let la denote the number of actively enrolled cases of LRTI and Ca denote the number of actively enrolled CAP cases with chest X-ray confirmation. r, with respect to age group (i) and gender (j), which holds those cases with positive chest X-rays (Cad) incidence of CAP in 2009pH1N1 influenza season was defined as cases detected from Sep to Dec 2009. no cases with 2009pH1N1 influenza infection were detected from Jan 2010 until the end of the study. the introduction of the H. influenzae type b (Hib) conjugate vaccine for all infants aged 2, 3, and 4 months did not take place until May 2010. the hospital served as the sole provider of hospital care for severe diseases in Nha Trang City. blood, sputum, and flocked nasopharyngeal swab specimens were obtained from participants immediately after admission and completion of an informed consent form. laboratory testing The clinical specimens were immediately transported to the hospital laboratory. definitions of pneumonia Patients were classified into either CAP or non-pneumonic lower respiratory tract infections (NPLRTI) the world health organisation\u2019s guideline for childhood pneumonia was modified to standardize the interpretation algorithm. a case was categorised as CAP if two or more evaluators agreed on the presence of consolidation. r i, j = C a d i, j / L a d i, j We assumed that this proportion was the same for the rest of ICD-10 coded pneumonia cases. we calculated incidences in age group i of 15\u201329, 30\u201344, 45\u201364 and 75 years and over. all statistical analyses were performed using Stata 12.0 (Stata Corp., USA) Ethics This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB) five patients had two episodes each, and one patient had four episodes. 174/367 (47%) were CAP, and the rest were NPLRTI. ence of underlying conditions (%) 115 (66) 99 (51) 0.004 HIV infection 4 (2) 3 (2) 0.6 History of tuberculosis (%) 13 (7) 3 (2) 0.006 Asthma (%) 11 (6) 13 (7) 0.9 Malnutrition (%) 30 (17) 11 (6) 0.001 Cerebrovascular disease (%) 17 (10) 15 (8) 0.5 Living with children aged 5 years (%) 55 (32) 60 (31) 1.0 Cigarette smoking history Current/past gorical variables and two-tailed unpaired t-tests were used for numerical variables. underlying conditions include malnutrition, chronic diarrhoea, heart disease, chronic lung disease, neuro-nervous disease, renal disease, thalassemia, liver disease, chronic heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, active tuberculosis. younger adults, aged 15\u201364 years, took antibiotics before admission more frequently than elderly patients 65 years (76/212, 36% vs. 4/93, 4%, p 0.001) however, taking antibiotics did not affect the risk of developing pneumonia in both age groups. the number of ICD-10-coded pneumonia cases as identified from the hospital admission database was 295. the incidence of hospitalised pneumonia per 1,000 persons by age group and gender. of the 289 tested by bacterial culture, 43 (15%) were positive. in culture, S. aureus and M. catarrhalis were the most frequently isolated. the numbers of positive PCRs with negative bacterial cultures were more than those of positive cultures with negative PCRs for all three bacteria. among 323 samples tested for either culture and/or PCR, 149 (46%) were positive for some bacterial pathogens. patterns of isolated bacteria were similar between CAP and NPLRTI. 71 (47) 104 (46) 28 (45) H. influenza 79 (28) 37 (27) 42 (28) 63 (28) 16 (26) S. pneumonia 65 (23) 31 (23) 34 (23) 51 (23) 14 (23) M. catarrhalis 15 (5) 8 (6) 7 (5) 7 (5) 0 Rhinovirus 22 (6) 9 (5) 13 (7) 16 (6) 6 (6) Adenovirus 3 (3) 8 (4) 13 (5) 0 RSV 4 (1) 1 (1) 3 (2) 2 the distribution of identified pathogens in each age group is shown in Figure 3. the mean duration from onset to admission was significantly longer in cases with bacterial infection compared with that of cases without bacterial infection. the 2009pH1N1 season was defined between September 2009 and December 2009. the estimated monthly incidences per 100,000 population were shown in solid line, those amongst young adults in dashed line. five patients had two episodes each, and one patient had four episodes. 174/367 (47%) were CAP, and the rest were NPLRTI.

CURB65 is the scoring system to add one point for each of confusion, urea >7 mmol/l, respiratory rate >30/min, low systolic (90 mmHg) or diastolic (60 mmHg) blood pressure. the number of ICD-10-coded pneumonia cases as identified from the hospital admission database was 295. this group was three times higher than that of actively enrolled CAP among Nha Trang residents. there was no significant difference in the mean length of hospital stay by each age group between actively enrolled cases and not enrolled cases. a total of 323 sputum samples were obtained from actively enrolled 323 cases. of the 289 tested by bacterial culture, 43 (15%) were positive for at least one bacterial pathogen. culture and/or PCR, 149 (46%) were positive for some bacterial pathogens. patterns of isolated bacteria were similar between CAP and NPLRTI. 71 (47) 104 (46) 28 (45) H. influenza 79 (28) 37 (27) 42 (28) 63 (28) 16 (26) S. pneumonia 65 (23) 31 (23) 34 (23) 51 (23) 14 (23) M. catarrhalis 15(5) 8 (6) 7 (5) 7 (6) 7 (6) 7 (6) 7 (5) 4 (6) Respiratory viruses No. tested 357 167 190 264 93 No. positive 73 (20%) were positive for some viruses, including one with patients of 15 to 64 years old were presented in left (A) and those over 65 years old were presented right (B). impact of the 2009 influenza pandemic In Vietnam, the first case of pandemic influenza A (H1N1) 2009 was reported on May 31, 2009. the one-year estimated incidence of hospitalised CAP among adults aged 15 years in central Vietnam was 0.8 per 1,000 PY. this figure was, in fact, lower than that of similar studies with chest X-ray-confirmed pneumonia in the western world. a selective bias towards severe patients is not a major factor. we need to collect information about health care seeking behaviour within the community to determine the actual incidence of CAP. the proportion of the elderly in Vietnam is lower than those in western counties. we believe molecular techniques are more appropriate for pathogen surveys because the results are less affected by pre-exposure to antibiotics. obtaining good quality sputum was found to be difficult. only 11% turned out to be 4 or 5 in Geckler\u2019s category. pneumonia among elderly and at-risk adults in the winter season in the us. 6% of hospitalised CAP patients during the winter season in the us. bacterial burden of S. pneumoniae was significantly higher in virus co-infected patients. a considerable proportion of ICD10-coded-pneumonia was not enrolled. this was due to certain pneumonia patients who were un-diagnosed on admission. this tendency was particularly observed in elderly patients who often lacked symptoms of acute respiratory infection. the annual number of hospitalised adult CAP patients in all of Vietnam will increase from 2009 to 2030 by 55% in people aged 15 years and by 79% in those aged 65 years. early intervention, such as vaccination against S. pneumoniae and influenza for the adult population, is warranted to address this foreseeable problem in Vietnam and other countries in SEA. the proportions of mild cases with PSI classes I or II and CURB65 score 0 or 1 were similar to those reported by Capelastegui (CURB65 0\u20131 69.8%, incidence of CRP 3.1 per 1,000PY) the proportion of the elderly in Vietnam is lower than those in Western counties. the proportion of positivity for H. influenzae (28%) in our study was substantially higher than previously reported. this difference may be because we used molecular techniques. PCR methods are known to detect pathogens even a few days after being exposed to antibiotics. the role of HRV in pneumonia among immunocompetent adults remains controversial. the high prevalence of HRV detected from nasopharynx samples in adult CAP cases suggests the involvement of HRV as a cause of pneumonia. in our study, RSV positives accounted for 11% of pneumonia among elderly and at-risk adults. in one HIV positive case, co-infection of S. pneumoniae and adenovirus was detected by bacterial culture and viral PCR. one single H. influenzae infection, two single S. pneumoniae infections and one co-infection with S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae were detected from bacterial PCR. a considerable proportion of ICD10-coded-pneumonia was not enrolled. population ageing and CAP Our study revealed that the one-year estimated incidence of CAP was relatively low in the current adult population in Vietnam. however, both the incidence and the case fatality ratio drastically increased with age and were highest among the elderly. the elderly population (persons aged 65 years) will reach 11 million (11%) in 2030.
