{"summary": "feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a chronic disease of cats that is caused by a mutated form of feline coronavirus (FCoV) (1). gross lesions may include pyogranulomas in multiple organs, polyserositis, and high protein cavitary effusions. cutaneous lesions associated with this disease are rare (2,5\u201311) histopathology revealed nodular pyogranulomatous dermatitis with vasculitis and necrosis. there was strong suspicion of FIP. the cat\u2019s health continued to decline, with progression to seizures. inflammatory cells often infiltrated the wall of veins in the meninges. pyogranulomatous inflammation and phlebitis in the periocular tissue. sections of the skin also featured multiple vessels with walls infiltrated by mixed inflammatory cells. the most common cutaneous manifestation is formation of papular nodules. there are single reports of swollen limbs with pitting edema and development of skin fragility syndrome in separate cases related to FIP virus infection. histologically, all cats in the 7 reported cases had similar pyogranulomatous vasculitis and necrosis within the dermis. all cases also showed positive immunostaining for FCoV antigen in macrophages in the dermis and other affected tissues. there has yet to be an explanation for the development of cutaneous lesions in few cases of FIP with absence in most cases."}
