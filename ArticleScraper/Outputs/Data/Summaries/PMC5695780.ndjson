{"summary": "pneumonia is one of the most frequent infectious diseases in industrialized countries. the leading infectious cause of death in children worldwide is the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus (S.) pneumoniae. the leading causative pathogen of community acquired pneumonia is the Gram-positive bacterium Streptococcus. a. baumannii and E. coli are ubiquitous Gram-negative bacteria. they have recently emerged as major causes of community-associated, nosocomial and ventilator-associated pneumonia [26, 27] and ventilator-associated pneumonia [19, 28] and septicemia induced acute lung injury [29, 30]. new studies have revealed first fundamental differences in histopathologic lesions caused by different pathogens in mouse lungs. however, scoring schemes for acute murine pneumonia existing to date are very superficial, addressing only a few, rather unspecific parameters. we have recently adapted more specific scoring criteria for S. pneumoniae and S. aureus-induced pneumonia. we identified the most suitable evaluation criteria for each model that will allow for more accurate semiquantitative assessments of the severities and distribution of pneumonic lesions. all animal procedures and protocols were approved by institutional ethics committees of Charit\u00e9-University of Berlin, Justus-Liebig University of Giessen, Philipps University of Marburg, University Hospital of Jena and local governmental authorities. mice were monitored once daily and appearance, behavior, grooming, respiration and body weight were protocolled. a single humane endpoint (loss of body weight of >15%) was defined but not reached by any of the mice employed due to their favourable clinical outcome at the infection dose used. all mice except of the MERS-CoV model were humanely euthanized by cervical dislocation. mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (75 mg/kg) E. coli (ATCC 25922) from -80\u00b0C glycerol stock was added to LB broth. incubated for 12 hours at 200 rpm and 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. pellet was resuspended in sterile 0.9% NaCl at 8 x 105 CFU E. coli / 200 l. 8 days after viral infection, S. pneumoniae was cultured and resuspended in sterile PBS. between 2 and 6 repetitions of the entire experimental procedures were performed in each model with similar group sizes.

Hammerschmidt) or with a purified goat antibody polyclonal to IAV H1N1 (1:4,000, OBT155, Bio-Rad, Puchheim, all mice, except for MERS-CoV infected mice, were monitored once daily. appearance, behavior, grooming, respiration and body weight were protocolled. a single humane endpoint (loss of body weight of >15%) was defined but not reached by any of the mice employed. mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (25 mg/kg) for experimental viral infections, mice were humanely euthanized by cervical dislocation after isoflurane anesthesia. mice were anesthetized intraperitoneally (i.p.) with ketamine (80 mg/kg) and xylazine (25 mg/kg) and transnasally inoculated with 5 x 106 CFU S. pneumoniae (n = 14 mice), 5 x 107 CFU S. aureus (n = 4), 5 x 108 CFU A. baumannii (n = 8), in 20 l PBS. mice were transduced transnasally with 20 l of an adenovirus vector encoding human DPP4 and mCherry with a final titer of 2.5 x 108 PFU per inoculum. mice were transnasally infected with 100 PFU PR8 in 50 l PBS (n = 4) under isoflurane anesthesia. in formalin pH 7.0 for 24 to 48 hours (MERS-CoV for 7 days) stained with hematoxylin and eosin after dewaxing in xylene and rehydration in decreasing ethanol concentrations. stained slides of entire lung sections were automatically digitized using the Aperio CS2 slide scanner (Leica Biosystems Imaging Inc., CA, USA) granulomatous at 6d Suppurative Necrotizing Necrotizing Suppurative Dominant inflammatory cell type Neutrophils Neutrophils / macrophages Neutrophils Neutrophils / macrophages Macrophages / lymphocytes Lymphocytes Neutrophils / lymphocytes / macrophages Abscess formation - + + - - - - - - - - - - - A. bauman-nii L. pneumo-phila E. coli MERS-CoV IAV IAV + S. pneumo-niae Expansion to peripheral lung regions ++ ++ + ++ - - + + ++ Peribronchial inflammation ++ + + + + + ++ Interstitial inflammation ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ ++ Infiltration by macrophages ++ ++ + + + + + + antigen retrieval was performed with microwave heating (600 W) in 10 mM citric acid (750 ml, pH 6.0) for 12 minutes (min) Lung sections were then incubated with a purified rabbit antibody polyclonal to S. pneumoniae (1:2,000, kindly provided by S. Hammerschmidt) kaline chromogen triamino-tritolyl-methanechloride was used as phosphatase substrate. all slides were counterstained with hematoxylin, dehydrated through graded ethanols, cleared in xylene and coverslipped. a broad spectrum of tissue lesions and immune cell infiltrations are typical of aerogenic bacterial pneumonia. a distinctive histopathological feature of pneumococcal pneumonia was the occurrence of massive suppurative to necrotizing pleuritis (Fig 1G, arrowhead) and steatitis (Fig 1H) myriads of pneumococci were clearly visible as bluish to purple dots of approximately 1 m in size. ocally extensive but non-expansive bronchopneumonia predominantly located near the lung hilus (Fig 2A) the main inflammatory cell population consisted of neutrophils, leading to mainly suppurative lesions with a tendency towards abscess formation. macrophages were also present albeit at lower numbers than neutrophils. K. pneumoniae Intratracheal infection of mice with K. pneumoniae resulted in severe widely expansive bronchopneumonia with increased lesion severity in the lung periphery. Recruited immune cells predominantly consisted of neutrophils, leading to suppurative to abscessing bronchopneumonia with hemorrhage and necrosis. mice developed expansive (Fig 4A) bronchopneumonia with predominantly infiltrating neutrophils causing a suppurative to abscess inflammation with areas of hemorrhage within alveoli and interstitium. perivascular spaces had mild to moderate edema and infiltration of lymphocytes and neutrophils. mice developed non-expansive (A), necrotizing to histiocytic interstitial pneumonia (B) with granuloma formation around blood vessels (C, arrowhead) and prominent lymphocytic perivascular cuffing with highly activated endothelial cells (D, arrowhead) at both time points, neither pleuritis nor steatitis were present. mice developed diffuse (A), neutrophilic interstitial (B) and perivascularly accentuated (C) pneumonia with marked vascular thrombosis (D, arrowhead). only moderate peribronchial (Fig 7C) and perivascular (Fig 7D) lymphocytic infiltrations were present. expansive (A), necrotizing (B), mixed-cellular bronchointerstitial pneumonia (B) with peribronchial and perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes (C, D), marked fibrinoid degeneration of blood vessels (D, asterisk), alveolar edema (E, arrowhead) and hemorrhage (F, arrowhead). o-histiocytic intraalveolar and interalveolar interstitial infiltration (D), prominent perivascular cuffing of lymphocytes (E) and protein-rich alveolar edema (F, asterisk) were seen. a combination and exponentiated phenotype of both models was observed 24 hours later. suppurative bronchopneumonia (B) with marked necrosis of bronchi were filled up with pus. perivascular infiltration of neutrophils, lymphocytes and monocytes with prominent edema (D) and mild purely lymphocytic, dense perivascular cuffing in other areas (E) and protein-rich alveolar edema (F, asterisk) were present. lesions induced by K. pneumoniae were mostly located in the periphery of the lobes and airways and much weaker adjacent to the hilus. hematogenously-induced sepsis with E. coli was associated with an entirely diffuse distribution of lesions affecting the whole lung. IAV-induced lesions restricted to individual lung lobes with a rather homogeneous distribution within affected lobes. almost all lung lesions were distributed asymmetrically between the left and right lung halves with no tendency of either half to be more often or more strongly affected. methanechloride (Neufuchsin) was used as chromogen (red) and hematoxylin (blue) as counterstain. immunohistochemistry is the method of choice for more specific pathogen detection on slides, particularly for viruses. perivascular interstitium was widely expanded by edema due to vascular leakage. suppurative and necrotizing vasculitis accompanied by hyaline thrombi within small-sized blood vessels were occasionally present. a distinctive histopathological feature of pneumococcal pneumonia was the occurrence of massive suppurative to necrotizing pleuritis and steatitis. transnasal infection with S. pneumoniae (5 x 106 CFU/ mouse) revealed widely expansive (A), suppurative to necrotizing bronchopneumonia (a-d), predominantly infiltrated by neutrophils within bronchial lumina (B) and alveoli (C) and large areas of necrosis and hemorrhage (D, arrowhead) additional features included marked neutrophilic infiltration and edema of perivascular spaces ( perivascular areas were predominantly infiltrated by lymphocytes and fewer neutrophils. vascular permeability seemed only slightly increased as reported before [38] and perivascular edema as well as protein-rich alveolar edema (Fig 2F, asterisk) were also present albeit to a lesser extent. increased vascular permeability was associated with massive alveolar (Fig 3D, asterisk) and perivascular edema (Fig 3E), admixed with myriads of bacteria easily recognizable as purple dots in the HE stain. suppurative to necrotizing vasculitis, pleuritis (Fig 3F, arrowhead) and steatitis were also present. Acinetobacter was invisible by HE stain and neither pleuritis nor steatitis were present. at 48 hours after infection, non-expansive pneumonia was found in close proximity to the hilus with prominent alveolar wall necrosis. mice developed non-expansive (A), necrotizing to histiocytic interstitial pneumonia (B) with granuloma formation around blood vessels (C, arrowhead) and prominent lymphocytic perivascular cuffing with highly activated endothelial cells (D, arrowhead) at the 6 day-time point. hematogeneous spread of E. coli to the lungs had resulted in diffuse, interstitial MERS-coronavirus transnasal infection with MERS-CoV resulted in expansive (A), necrotizing, mixed-cellular bronchointerstitial pneumonia (B) with peribronchial and perivascular infiltration of lymphocytes (C, D), marked fibrinoid degeneration of blood vessels (D, asterisk), alveolar edema (E, arrowhead) and hemorrhage (F, arrowhead). lungs showed a diffusely distributed bronchointerstitial pneumonia restricted to single lung lobes only. alveolar necrosis was prominent and alveolar septae were diffusely distended by infiltrating inflammatory cells. large areas of alveolar edema were present, suggesting vascular damage and increased permeability. the character of pneumonia included massive infiltration of neutrophils into alveoli and bronchi. bronchial epithelium was almost entirely necrotic and bronchi were filled up with pus. a severe protein-rich alveolar edema was seen, similar to that seen in the S. pneumoniae mono-infection. small tissue samples from experimentally infected mouse lungs are commonly removed for molecular analyses of gene and/or protein expression or other readout systems. some experimental protocols recommend using the left and right halves of the lungs for different analytical procedures. however, when we analyzed the distributions and bilateral symmetry of lung lesions for each of the infection models, we found a wide spectrum of distinct distributions and asymmetries. infection of murine lungs with different bacterial or viral pathogens resulted in striking differences in distributions, expansions and symmetries of pneumonic lesions that were highly reproducible for each pathogen. hematogenous infection with E. coli was associated with entirely diffuse distribution of lesions affecting the whole lungs with a rather homogeneous distribution within affected lobes. a wide range of special stains have been used for the histological visualization of pathogens and other relevant structures. pathogens were visualized using special stains commonly used for bacterial detection, including the Gram stain for Gram-positive pneumococci (A, dark blue, arrowhead) and Giemsa stain of Klebsiella (B, light blue, arrowhead) we carved out the most characteristic lesion patterns that appear suitable for the development of specific scoring schemes for each model (Table 2). Discussion Different mouse models of acute pneumonia differ widely, with an obvious strong dependence on pathogen-specific features of virulence and spread, route of infection, infectious dose and other factors. the model-associated characteristics of tissue lesions and immune cell infiltrates are consistent with well-established properties of the different pathogens used. for example, the destructive tissue damage with mostly neutrophilic infiltrations as seen in S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and A. baumannii are typically seen with extracellular bacteria. the clinical outcome of mice infected with A. baumannii and S. aureus was more favourable compared to infection with S. pneumoniae or K. pneumoniae [38] which may be explained by the lack of bacterial spreading throughout the thoracic cavity and adjacent tissues, and possibly sepsis. subsequent superinfection with low-dose S. pneumoniae potentiated the severity of the IAV-induced lesions and aggravated the course of pneumonia. however, it did not alter the principal histological characteristics of IAV-pneumonia. asymmetrical distributions have a tremendous impact in practical terms when acute mouse pneumonia is sampled for molecular studies. the practice of sampling different regions of such lungs for different readout systems appears highly problematic. we selected 23 single histopathologic criteria for the design of semiquantitative scoring systems suitable for each model. hematoxylin and eosin staining of tissue sections failed to visualize most pathogens. traditional special stains and immunohistochemical techniques were employed. both approaches will likely also allow for a rough quantification of pathogen numbers in tissues. all models were conducted with C57BL/6 mice which is among the most commonly used mouse strain in infection research. variations of the strain or genetic background may have a dramatic impact on the type, severity and outcome of inflammation, particularly in innate immune responses. a spectrum of pathogen- and model-specific lesion characteristics have been identified in mouse models of acute mouse pneumonia. only the combination of these techniques will lead to a better understanding of the disease in the complex context of the entire lung pathology."}
