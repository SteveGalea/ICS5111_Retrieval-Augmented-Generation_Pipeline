{"summary": "the high-risk types of HPV have relatively low self-clearance rate compared to the low-risk types of HPV. no therapeutic vaccines or drugs have been approved for clinical use to treat HPV-infected patients. the highly potent neutralizing antibodies elicited by HPV vaccines were found to bind to the L1 protein and prevent HPV infection. so, the L1 pentamer is regarded as the most important target for development of antiviral agents against HPV infection. the first peptide-based HIV entry inhibitor, SJ-2176, was approved by U.S. FDA for clinical use in 2003. 3HP--LG could not inactivate HPV PsV, but it inhibits entry into the host cell via its interaction with virus, not the cell. this suggests that 3HP--LG inhibits HPV infection by binding, via its negatively charged region, to the receptor on the basement membrane in vaginal mucosa. each kind of protein was dissolved with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 8.5) at a final concentration of 20 mg/ml. proteins were mixed with anhydrides (HP at 1 M in DMSO) to a final concentration of 60 mM by the addition of five equal aliquots at 20-min intervals. pH was adjusted to 9.0 with 4 M NaOH after each mixing. the lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the lysate was quantified for the concentration of L1/L2 capsid protein levels. the inhibitory activity of 3HP--LG against HPV PsV entry into HeLa or HaCaT cells was detected as previously described. anti-HPV L1 (type16 or 18) antibody (Abcam, UK) was added at a 1: 1,000 dilution. after washing and adding tetramethylbenzidine, the absorbance was measured at 450 nm. similar protocols were used for detection of 3HP--LG in rhesus monkeys. time-of-Addition Assay HeLa cells were plated in a 96-well plate overnight. each titration volume was 2 l, and the titration interval was 60 s for the first drop. cells were then incubated with 3HP--LG at a final concentration of 15 g/ml. rhesus macaques were randomly divided into treatment group and control group. vaginal gel containing 3HP--LG (1.8 mg per dose) was dispersed into carbomer gel and administered intravaginally or rectally. cells were seeded onto coverslips in a 6-well plate. the cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG (1, 1,000) at room temperature for 1h. the coverslips were sealed with Prolong Gold Antifade reagent with 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole and scanned with the leica SP8 confocal microscope. the lysate was centrifuged at 5,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the pH was adjusted to 9.0 with 4 M NaOH after each mixing. all mixtures were kept at 25\u00b0C for two more hours. 3HP--LG or -LG was serially diluted in DMEM and incubated with 100 l of HPV PsV (equal to 35 ng L1) cells were lysed for measurement of luciferase activity. similar protocols were used for detection of 3HP--LG in the serum of rhesus monkeys and 3HP--LG-specific IgA and IgE in the vaginal swab eluates. the samples were leftover samples from the clinical trials for evaluating the in vivo safety and efficacy of the intravaginally applied vaginal gels. cells in 96-well plates were preincubated with 100 l of 3HP--LG (5 M) or -LG (5 M) at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. cells were incubated with 3HP--LG mixture at 4\u00b0C for 12 h. cells were lysed to determine luciferase activity. rhesus macaques were randomly divided into treatment group and control group. vaginal gel containing 3HP--LG (1.8 mg per dose) was dispersed into carbomer gel and administered intravaginally or rectally. in the control group, only carbomer gel was applied. 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride-modified bovine beta-lactoglobulin (3HP--LG) is a promising HPV entry inhibitor against entry of PsV of both high-risk and low-risk HPV types. this inhibitory activity was attributed to the interaction of the increased net negative charges on -LG after 3-hydroxyphthalic anhydride modification. protein candidates include human serum albumin (HSA), -lactoglobulin (-LG) and chicken ovalbumin (OVA) protein candidates include human serum albumin (HSA), -lactoglobulin (-LG) and -lactoglobulin (-LG) 3HP--LG was also effective against entry of HPV16 and HPV58 PsV into haCaT cells. this suggests that 3HP--LG acts on the virus, rather than the target cell. the most abundant protein on the HPV particle is L1 protein. each sample was tested in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice. the binding ability of 3HP--LG and -LG to these peptides was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 3-Hydroxyphthalic Anhydride Modified Bovine Beta-Lactoglobulin did not inactivate human papillomavirus Pseudovirus. instead, 3HP--LG blocked entry into the target cell via its inaction with Virus, Not Cells. 3HP--LG incubated HPV PsV with 3HP--LG at room temperature for 2 h. 3HP--LG or -LG inhibited HPV PsV entry by targeting the virus, not the host cell. the cells were incubated with 3HP--LG at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with/without washing by DMEM before addition of HPV PsV. 3HP--LG is sufficiently active to inhibit HPV PsV entry into the target cell. at 4\u00b0C, HPV PsV could bind to cell receptors, but could not fully enter the cytoplasm because the speeds of membrane fusion and cytoskeletal transformation are reduced at such low temperature. 3-Hydroxyphthalic Anhydride Modified Bovine Beta-Lactoglobulin Could Not Penetrate Into the Cell and the Vaginally Applied 3-Hydroxyphthalic Anhydride Modified Bovine Beta-Lactoglobulin Did Not Enter Into the Blood Circulation. we incubated HeLa cells and 293 T cells with 3HP--LG for 24 h and then washed the cells three times using PBS. 3HP--LG was formulated in a carbomer gel (1.8 mg/each) and administered through the vagina or anus of rhesus macaques. their blood samples were collected at different time points before and after gel application. the concentration of 3HP--LG was quantified with ELISA using anti-3HP--LG mAb. 3HP--LG exhibited potent anti-HPV activity in a dose-dependent manner with an IC50. this is more potent than that of 3HP-HSA (IC50: 2.28 g/ml) 3HP-OVA and all three unmodified proteins showed no significant inhibitory activity against HPV16 PsV entry into the target cell. 3HP--LG was also effective against entry of HPV16 and HPV58 PsV into haCaT cells. each sample was tested in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice. 3-Hydroxyphthalic Anhydride Modified Bovine Beta-Lactoglobulin Binds to the L1 Protein. 3HP--LG inhibited HPV PsV entry into the target cell. the most abundant protein on the HPV particle is L1 protein. LKAKPKFTLGKRKAT or region of residues 493\u2013505 (STSTTAKRKKRKL) of HPV16. binding ability of 3HP--LG and -LG to these peptides was measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) 3HP--LG incubated with 3HP--LG at room temperature for 2 h. 3HP--LG blocked HPV PsV entry by targeting virus. 3HP--LG blocked entry by targeting virus, not cells. 3HP--LG inhibited HPV PsV entry by targeting the virus, not the host cell. each sample was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with/without washing by DMEM before addition of HPV PsV. 3HP--LG blocked the attachment between PsV and cell receptor at the earliest stage of infection. the cells were washed with DMEM to remove the unbound proteins, or not washed (as control), before addition of HPV PsV. 3HP--LG could enter into epithelial cells, we incubated 293 cells with 3HP--LG for 24 h and then washed them three times using PBS. the cells were stained with anti-3HP--LG antibody or anti-actin antibody, as a control, and donkey anti-mouse IgG. these results indicate that 3HP--LG could neither enter into the cell nor bind the cell surface proteins. 3HP--LG was formulated in a carbomer gel (1.8 mg/each) and administered through the vagina or anus of rhesus macaques. their blood samples were collected at different time points before and after the application. each sample was tested in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice. the vaginal gel containing 3HP--LG has shown excellent efficacy and safety to treat high-risk HPV infections. however, how 3HP--LG inhibits HPV entry into the target cell is still unclear. negatively charged residues on 3HP--LG play an important role in 3HP--LG-mediated inhibition of HPV infection. the structure of 3HP--LG was modeled by COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) using the crystal structure of -LG. crystal structure of HSPG-bound HPV L1 pentamer was shown as electrostatic surface. 3HP--LG can also inhibit infection of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 3HP-modified HSA (3HP-HSA) was also effective, while 3HP-modified OVA (3HP-OVA) was not effective in inhibiting HPV PsV entry. the newly invaded HPV accesses the basal cell layer through micro lesions or breaks in the cervical epithelium and binds to the HSPG receptor on the basement membrane. this interaction results in a series of conformational changes in the capsid, which leads to protease digestion of L2 and exposure of its N terminus. after HPV infects the epithelial cell, it gradually matures along with the host cell cycles and moves toward the top layer of epith 3HP--LG can interact with the virions, rather than the cells, to effectively block the entry of HPV PsV into the target cell, but could not inactivate the virions. the topical formulations containing 3HP--LG can be safely used to treat local HPV infection. conflict of interest The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships."}
