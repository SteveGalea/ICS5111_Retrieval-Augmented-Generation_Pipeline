{"summary": "encephalitis is a rare but clinically serious outcome of infection with a range of DNA and RNA viruses. encephalitis is associated with appreciable mortality and high rates of permanent neurological impairment in survivors, and in most cases there is no available antiviral therapy. the extent to which inborn errors of innate immunity underlie encephalitis more generally, including in adults, remains to be determined. the alternative hypothesis is that pathogenesis is governed not by a failure to resist viral replication, but rather due to excessive innate immune-mediated damage. however, there remains no conclusive proof of a causal link between immune activation and neurological outcome. a key theme to emerge from recent studies is the role of antiviral immunity within the brain itself. the brain parenchyma poses an intrinsic antiviral network in which the antiviral cytokines known as type I interferons (IFNs) play a central role. microglia are the \u201cthird element\u201d of the CNS, initially described by Ram\u00f3n y Cajal. they are parenchymal resident macrophages of the brain parenchyma. this period coincides with neuronal birth and is before the formation of the blood-brain barrier and the development of astrocytes. studies reported both protective (41, 60) and pathogenic (61, 62) effects of microglia in encephalitis models. however, depletion of microglia is incomplete. the original approach was an infusion of liposomes, which are toxic to macrophages. Il34LacZ/LacZ reporter mice have been used in a limited number of studies of viral encephalitis (68, 69) blockade of CSF1R effectively depletes microglia from the brain of intact rodents (72) n/r n/r n/r n/r n/r n/r n/r n/a C3 mediated phagocytosis Seitz SW PLX5622 F 14 d Flaviviridae WNV (f.p.) \u2013 SW PLX5622 F 14 d Flaviviridae JEV (f.p.) microglial depletion was associated with a negative impact on clinically relevant endpoints such as neurological disease and/or death. microglia-depleted mice correlated with viral burden in the brain. microglia depletion of microglia impairs the antiviral function of Recruited T cells. no impact on the quality and magnitude of the antiviral T cell response was observed in others. in MHV, both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells are involved in viral clearance (80, 81), while CD4+ T cells also contribute to pathogenesis (82). microglia depletion did not negatively impact CD8+ T cell recruitment, but was associated with significant reductions in the recruitment of CD4+ T cells and Tregs. however, the precise nature of the protective T cell response induced by microglia requires further examination. the outcome of infection in microglia-depleted Il34LacZ/LacZ mice was not reported (69), whereas in a previous study using the same model there was significantly enhanced mortality in Il34LacZ/LacZ (microglia-depleted) mice (68) microglial phagocytosis may prevent mortality in the acute phase (68, 74), this might come at later stages at a cost of permanent neurological damage (69). there is no definitive explanation for these contradictory observations. one possibility is increased recruitment of circulating monocytes to microglia-depleted brains in circumstances where cytokine/chemokine synthesis was enhanced (76, 77), which was not observed in other studies (58, 74, 78) increased microglial CD45 expression has been noted during VSV encephalitis (58), which might confound assessment of the effect of PLX5622 on CNS macrophages. the use of more specific markers of microglia (e.g., TMEM119) or perivascular macrophages might help resolve this issue (93, 94) the extent to which possible \u201coff-target\u201d effects of CSF1R inhibition might confound data generated in encephalitis models remains uncertain. an intriguing observation\u2013that microglial depletion leads in some circumstances to enhanced neuroinflammation, hints at a possible regulatory function of microglia in encephalitis."}
