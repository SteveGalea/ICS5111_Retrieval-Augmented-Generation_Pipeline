{"summary": "oseltamivir is an antiviral drug against neuraminidase. it directly interacts with the catalytic residues of the neuraminidase catalytic site. resistance to zanamivir has already become a widespread phenomenon. oseltamivir has good bioavaibility and is effective for treatment and prevention of epidemic influenza infection in adults, adolescents and children[18]. molecular dynamics simulation was performed to determine the best candidate ligand based on the lowest binding energy and interaction. 3CKZ chain A with mutation His274Tyr as template was applied to build the latest structure of N1. the root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) was calculated to identify structural similarity between template model mutated with 3D structure from homology modeling. 3D shape was obtained by saving it in the 3D viewer of ACD Labs. the initialization of the docking process was applied with MOE 2009.10 software[9],[30],[33]. ligands were flexible, whereas receptor was fixed. a total of 1,000 populations for scoring function were used for LondonDG and repetition force field[9],[30],[33]. geometry optimization and energy minimization of 3D structure neuraminidase complex ligands were perfomed with MOE 2009.10 software[31]. Molecular dynamics simulation of complex enzyme-ligand at temperature of 300 K was employed from heating at temperature of 300 K to 312 K for 20 ps. position, velocity and acceleration were saved every 0.5 ps. the alignment result was forwarded into homology pipeline for further processing of 3D structure determination. the homology modeling was performed using the Swiss model. the conformation structure energy of ligands was minimized using the root-mean-square gradient energy with 0.001 kcal/mol[9]. other parameters were in accordance with existing default in the MOE 2009.10 software[32]. molecular dynamics simulation Molecular dynamics simulation was carried out at 2 different temperatures using simulations-Dynamics program in MOE 2009.10 software[37]. the solvation in potential setup was born with RMS gradient of 0.05[38]. homology model for neuraminidase of influenza A virus H1N1 was obtained using template 3CKZ chain A that contains mutation His274Tyr. the reliability of homology model of N1 was identified by Ramachandran plot[11],[15]. about 95.8% of residues were in the core region of the Ramachandran map. superimposition was calculated to find out the degree of similarity between template 3CKZ chain A (PDB code) and the homology model. properties of three of the best ligands AD3BF2D, CA1G3B, and F1G4B and oseltamivir as standard ligand showed that these ligands had the lowest binding energy than oseltamivir as standards. the level of the lowest G value was AD3BF2D, CA1G3B, and F1G4B ligands with G = 7.8885, 7.6293, and 7.5637 k Ligand AD3BF2D CA1G3B F1G4B OTV (standard) G (kcal/mol) 7.8885 7.6293 7.5637 4.2841 pKi (mol/L) 15.636 12.689 13.630 10.745 Molecular weight 489.542 462.496 481.475 313.418 H Donor 6 3 8 4 H Acceptor 7 11 3 1 Binding to the catalytic site 10 10 5 0 Hydrogen bonds between amino acid residues with these hydrogen bonds were chosen as the basis of molecular dynamics simulation. the interaction of the best ligands, AD3BF2D, CA1G3B and F1G4B with the enzyme was evaluated in the hydrated state. the interaction between molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation decreased from 10 hydrogen bonds to 1 and 3 hydrogen bonds. the interaction between molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation decreased from 10 hydrogen bonds to 1 and 3 hydrogen bonds at the end of simulations of temperatures of 300 K and 312 K. glu277, Glu278, Glu278, Arg118, Glu119, Ala138, Glu277, Glu278, Arg118, Glu119, Ala138, Glu277, Glu278, His297, Ser180, Glu230, Glu230, red text: residues in framework. the stability of hydrogen bonds occurred between Glu278 as one of the catalytic residues of neuraminidase and NH3 as the the changes in conformation of the enzyme-AD3BF2D ligand complex occurred during simulations at two different temperatures. the binding pocket of this complex changed from the \u2018closed\u2019 form into the \u2018open\u2019 state at the end of simulation. apioside and ammonium functional groups did not form hydrogen bonds with binding pocket. RMSD Graphic of CA1GB and Neuraminidase (NA) dynamics at 300 K. X axis represents molecular dynamics time duration in picoseconds. Y axis represents the RMSD value. the reliability of homology model of N1 was identified by Ramachandran plot[11],[15]. it was limited by an orange area, that had coordinate of secondary protein structure as maximum tolerance limit area of steric strain. glysine was not allowed because it did not have a side chain. the 1,232 ligands resulted in 100 best ligands; then, repeated docking resulted in 20 best ligands. the molecular weight for drug likeness must be under 500 g/mol[43],[44]. most of the best ligands have the O-glycoside and the apioside group as the functional group of modified oseltamivir[17],[28]. these values were better than pKi values of oseltamivir with 10.745 M. the molecular weights of these ligands were under 500 g/mol. the properties of the three best ligands and standard ligand. AD3BF2D ligand had hydrogen bonds with Arg118, two bindings with Glu278 and Arg 293, two bindings with Arg368 and three bindings with Tyr402. oseltamivir did not have hydrogen bond for interacting with the catalytic site of neuraminidase. ligands have the ability to inhibit neuraminidase. molecular dynamics simulation The evolution time of the hydrogen bonds from the inhibitor-enzyme complex provides an approach to evaluate the convergence of the dynamical properties of the system[25]. the interaction of the best ligands, AD3BF2D, CA1G3B and F1G4B with the enzyme was evaluated in the hydrated state. 121, Arg225 AD3BF2D Arg118, Glu119, Glu228, Glu278, Arg293, Arg368, Arg368, Tyr402, Tyr402, Arg225, Glu228, Ser229, Ser229, Glu277, Glu278 Glu278, Arg293, Arg293, CA1G3B Arg118, Glu119, Arg152, Arg152, Arg152, Arg152, Arg stability of hydrogen bonds also increased at simulations at 312 K. interaction with Arg293 as catalytic residue of neuraminidase resulted in two hydrogen bonds. interaction after simulations could not form hydrogen bonds due to the mobility of amino acid residues in the binding catalytic site. ligand-receptor interaction reached its stability after 2,000\u20133,000 ps. this would suggest that the ligands, as drug candidates, are within the stable condition in the human body. the RMSD Graphic of AD3BF2D and Neuraminidase (NA) dynamics at 300 K. the graphics show that after 3,000 ps, the structure become stable. a feasible and powerful transcriptomics based tool has been generated for viral bioinformatics research[49]-[52]. a total of 1,232 modified ligands molecules have been designed and screened by molecular docking. three of the best ligands, AD3BF2D, CA1G3B, and F1G4B were obtained with the lowest binding energy that contradicts to OTV as standard. usman Sumo Friend Tambunan supervised this research.
