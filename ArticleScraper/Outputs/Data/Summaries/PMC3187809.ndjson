{"summary": "IFN- and IFN- are structurally related cytokines of the type I interferon family which mediate an early innate immune response to viral infections. there are 13 distinct IFN- genes present in the human genome, and a single gene encoding for IFN-. these genes are transcriptionally activated in cells sensing a virus infection. type II IFN and IFN- (type III IFN) exhibit antiviral activities, although they bind to distinct receptors. type III IFNs act primarily on epithelial cells [11], and probably play an important role in the innate immune response of epithelial tissues to virus infections. a human hepatoma cell line harbouring a selectable hepatitis C virus replicon has been successfully employed for the measurement of type I IFN from patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection [20]. a novel type I IFN bioassay is presented, which is highly sensitive and quantifiable due to the expression of a firefly luciferase reporter gene. UMNSAH/DF-1 chicken fibroblast cell line was maintained in EMEM with 10% FBS. all cell lines were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere. DF-1 cells were kept at 39\u00b0C. the firefly luciferase gene was amplified from the pBI-L plasmid (Clontech) by Pfu PCR and inserted into the fifth transcrition unit. the resulting plasmid was designated pVSV*G(Luc) and contained 6 genes in the order N-P-M-eGFP-Luc-L. cells were grown in 100-mm diameter culture dishes to 90% confluence. infected with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (5 pfu per cell) expressing T7 RNA polymerase. cells were triedpsinized 24 hours post transfection. plates were inoculated with 40 l of serial tenfold virus dilutions for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the wells additionally received 60 l of EMEM and were incubated for 20 h at 37\u00b0C. the infectious titers were calculated according to the number of GFP-expressing cells/well. the cells were infected with VSV*G(Luc) (m.o.i. of 5) and incubated for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C. the medium was aspirated and 30 l of luciferase lysis buffer was added. the cell lysates were stored at 20\u00b0C. the plates were washed with tap water to remove excess crystal violet. the dye was dissolved by adding 100 l of 70% ethanol to each well. the absorbance of crystal violet at 595 nm was determined with a microplate reader. coma cells (ATCC), NHDF normal human dermal fibroblasts (Lonza, Cologne, Germany) were maintained in EMEM with 10% FBS. all cell lines were cultured at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere. the firefly luciferase gene was amplified from the pBI-L plasmid (Clontech) by Pfu PCR and inserted into the fifth transcrition unit. the resulting plasmid was designated pVSV*G(Luc) and contained 6 genes in the order N-P-M-eGFP-Luc-L. cells were grown in 100-mm diameter culture dishes to 90% confluence. infected with modified vaccinia virus Ankara (5 pfu per cell) expressing T7 RNA polymerase (MVA-T7) the wells received 60 l of EMEM and were incubated for 20 h at 37\u00b0C. the infectious titers were calculated according to the number of GFP-expressing cells/well and expressed as fluorescence-forming units per milliliter (ffu/ml) the cells were inoculated with tenfold serial virus dilutions for 90 min. the cells were infected with VSV*G(Luc) (m.o.i. of 5) and incubated for 5 hours at 37\u00b0C. the medium was aspirated and 30 l of luciferase lysis buffer was added to the cells. the cell lysates were stored at 20\u00b0C. the dye was dissolved by adding 100 l of 70% ethanol to each well. the absorbance of crystal violet at 595 nm was determined with a microplate reader. the IFN titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the last IFN dilution causing 50% inhibition of virus-induced CPE. up to 109 virus replicon particles (VRP) were released into the cell culture supernatant 24 h post infection. infected cells were readily detected (5 to 6 h post infection) but non-helper cells were unable to complement the VSV G deletion. this can be ascribed to the host shut-off activity of the VSV matrix protein. normal human dermal fibroblasts (NHDF) were incubated for several time periods with serial dilutions of human IFN- before infection with VSV*G(Luc) a dose-dependent effect of IFN- on firefly luciferase reporter activity was observed after 1 hour of incubation. about 0.05 units of IFN- were now sufficient to suppress reporter activity by 50%. the axes of abscissas indicate the activities of the type I IFNs as determined with a conventional IFN bioassay. the axes of abscissas indicate the activities of the type I IFNs as determined with a conventional CPE-based IFN bioassay. VSV*G(Luc) replicon bioassay was used. about 0.8 pg/ml of a commercial IFN- standard resulted in 50% antiviral activity. replicon-based bioassay proved to be more sensitive than conventional. dissolved in 70% ethanol before absorbance at 595 nm was recorded. species-dependent action of type I IFN was analysed by incubating human, canine, murine, and chicken cells for 20 hours with 5 units of type I IFN from either the homologous species or a different one. NHDF were incubated for 20 h with serial fourfold dilutions of human, porcine and murine type I IFNs. the cells were infected with VSV*G(Luc) for 5 h. firefly luciferase activity was recorded in the cell lysates. human IFN- and porcine IFN- (each at 800 units/ml) were heated for 30 min at the indicated temperatures and thereafter diluted 110 with medium containing 5% FBS. the heat-treated IFN preparations were incubated for 20 h with NHDF and PK-15 cells. treatment with acid may be employed to inactivate virus in a test sample without affecting the activity of type I and type III IFNs. alkaline may be used to differentiate between type I and type III IFNs. this can be ascribed to the host shut-off activity of the VSV matrix protein. infection of BHK-21 cells with VSV*G(Luc) resulted in increased firefly luciferase reporter activity with time. signal-to-noise ratio was sufficiently high at this time. luciferase reporter activity increased linearly between 0.004 and 40 ffu/cell. 0.05 units of IFN- were now sufficient to suppress reporter activity by 50%. sensitivity of the assay is higher if the cells were incubated with IFN- for prolonged time. porcine IFN- showed a different kinetics on PK-15 porcine kidney cells. the assay is applicable to type I IFN from different species but may perform differentially on distinct cell types. samples containing type I IFN of unknown activity were tested against a commercial IFN- standard. amounts of type I IFN were sufficient to reduce the luciferase reporter activity by 50%. dilutions of IFN- standard were prepared and incubated with NHDF for 20 h. the antiviral activity relative to infected but non-treated cells was calculated. on human cells, we treated NHDF for 20 hours with serial dilutions of human, porcine, and murine type I IFNs. the cells were subsequently infected with VSV*G(Luc) for 5 h and firefly luciferase activity was recorded in the cell lysates. the activity of human IFN- was fully maintained when the cytokine was incubated for 30 min at 50\u00b0C. at 60\u00b0C, 99% of the activity was preserved (p = 0.021) at 70\u00b0C, the activity of human IFN- dropped to 83%. only when human IFN- was heated to 100\u00b0C for 30 min, activity was completely abolished. firefly luciferase activity was determined in cell lysates 5 h post infection. human IFN- and human IFN- were treated for 30 min with either 0.1 M HCl, 0.1 M NaOH or H2O. the antiviral activity of human IFN- was not significantly affected by acid (p>0.05) viruses in conventional type I IFN bioassays make appropriate biosafety measures necessary to reduce the risk of unwanted virus transmission and infection. the replicon particles produced on these cells can run a single cycle of infection but cannot produce any infectious progeny. replicon replicates exclusively in the cytosol and does not produce cDNA intermediates. luciferase reporter allowed us to quantify the reduction of virus replication. this likely reflects the high reporter gene expression at low levels of type I IFN and the inaccuracy associated with pipetting small volumes (6 l) the replicon assay was possible to quantify the antiviral activity of IFN- (Il-29), a type III IFN. this raises the important question of how to distinguish between different antiviral cytokines. but acid may not be used to distinguish between type I and type III IFNs. the test may be further developed to quantify the antiviral activity of other cytokines such as type II and type III."}
