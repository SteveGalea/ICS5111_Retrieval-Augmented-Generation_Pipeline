{"summary": "the first case of the novel Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was observed in June 2012 in Saudi Arabia. it has caused more than 1500 confirmed human infections with more than 580 deaths. since 2012, MERS-CoV has jumped across continental boundaries to Europe, Northern America and recently South Korea. the first human case of MERS-CoV was observed in asir province, located in the southwest of Saudi Arabia. however, the first outbreak was not detected until 2013 in eastern province, followed by Riyadh in central Saudi Arabia, with more than 60 confirmed cases. the Arabian Peninsula is currently considered as the most critical global epicentre for MERS-CoV. inferences related to epidemic spread and introductions failed to identify evidence for seasonality. this has been attributed to either under-reporting or neglecting the significant number of asymptomatic or mild cases [21] our goal is to infer epidemic spread over time, identify baseline patterns of infection, and quantify seasonality and trends at different regional levels. the study region included countries of the Arabian Peninsula, referred to officially as the Gulf Cooperative Council (GCC) countries. since 95% of cases were reported in Saudi Arabia, we stratified our time series to plot and compare epidemic curves. we further stratified our time series to plot and compare epidemic curves for three geographical regions within Saudi Arabia where the highest number of cases were observed and reported. ARIMA models can be used for short-term forecasting of acute infectious disease incidences like influenza and hence aid in disease intervention strategies [33]. trend and seasonality can be included in model (1) as interpretable terms. the model was estimated using the arima function in R by including suitable covariates in the classical ARIMA(p,q), leading to the model (2). three criteria were taken into account for fitting the most appropriate model: (1) the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), (2) the significance of the model's parameters and (3) the validation of the residuals. the final dataset compromised 1488 observed (date of case observation) and 1710 reported (date of reporting by the official government and international entities) human cases between June 2012 and July 2017. we then plotted and compared epidemic curves for both observed and reported cases. method averages over all potential disease transmission networks compatible with the observed cases to compute reproductive numbers for each point of time since the onset of the epidemic. TD-Rs were calculated for each week of the epidemic starting from the onset week of the outbreak. t denotes the number of reported cases at time t, is an intercept, 1, 2,..., p, are the coefficients of autoregressive terms, and Zt, Zt\u20131,..., Zt\u2013q are the terms of the model which are normally distributed. these models assume that the time series is stationary and there are no trend or seasonality patterns. several abnormally large peaks corresponding to the epidemic in the selected Saudi regions were observed in the selected time-series data, between 2012 and 2017. these peaks, considered outliers in the context of classical ARIMA modelling, caused overdispersion in our selected models and severely skewed our forecasting results. analysis for handling peaks with more than 20 cases suggests that all of the three methods produced similar results. we chose the method (a) for all of the three Saudi regions due to its simplicity and epidemiological plausibility. the epidemic curve of all observed cases in the Arabian Peninsula showed a marked peak in April and May 2014. inferred time-dependent reproductive numbers (TD-Rs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CI) for Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in the Arabian Peninsula from June 2012 to July 2017. arrow in (b) indicates super-spreading event (TD-R > 10) the series of Eastern province ranges from 0 to 26 weekly MERS-CoV cases, with a median of 0 cases per week. the best-fitting model predicted a mean of one case per week and a 95% CI between zero and eight cases. the best-fitting model for the Riyadh region corresponded to an ARIMA (2,0,0) (Table 2) with biannual seasonality (T2 = 26 weeks; Fig. 3b) this selected model predicted a mean of two cases per week and a 95% CI between zero and 17 cases. the series of Makkah ranges from to 70 cases per week. preliminary results The Wilcoxon signed-rank test indicated no significant difference (P-values 0.05) between observed and reported cases with a median difference of approximately 1.2 weeks between the date of observation and reporting (8 days) the final count of cases matched those of both WHO and MoH databases for the GCC countries. the epidemic curve of Makkah showed only one distinct peak in 2014. we inferred 12 time periods where TD-Rs were significant. seven out of 12 significant spreading events were inferred in the spring of 2014. three significant spreading events inferred in 2015. the arrow in (b) indicates a super-spreading event (TD-R > 10) the arrow indicates a super-spreading event (TD-R > 10) 96 April-2014 7.63 (5.33\u201310.00) 97 April-2014 2.52 (2.25\u20132.78) 239 January-2017 2.32 (1.50\u20135.00) 240 January-2017 3.21 (2.20\u20138.00) a Time-dependant reproductive number. b 95% confidence interval. c Gulf Council Countries. grey lines represent number of reported cases, green lines represent fitted number of cases, and red dotted lines represent 95% CI for the predicted number of cases. places where the green and red lines are discontinued represents the peaks with more than 20 cases. our estimated regional-level TD-Rs ranged between 1.19 and 4.01. the first significant TD-R inferred in march 2014 and the most recent significant TD-R inferred in June 2017. the largest TD-Rs (>3) occurred in April 2014. this suggested that the number of secondary cases caused by a primary case reached its maximum peak during this particular period of time. the development of laboratory diagnostic methods had reached a milestone in 2014, which increased the capacity for detecting cases in both humans and animals. however, these advancements in surveillance and diagnostic methods facilitated the success of control and prevention measures in the region. both regions are important epicentres for MERS-CoV spread and maintenance in the Arabian Peninsula. inferred TD-Rs for the three regions of Saudi Arabia did not demonstrate seasonality of MERS-CoV outbreaks. this confirms the notion that MERS-CoV continues to maintain itself in the camel\u2013human transmission cycle in the Arabian Peninsula. this confirms the notion that MERS-CoV continues to maintain itself in the camel\u2013human transmission cycle. an endemic pattern of MERS-CoV cases, with sporadic outbreaks, was the best-fitting model for the incident case series of the Eastern Province. the annual movements of camels from Eastern province to Riyadh might constitute an important dispersal route of season zoonotic infection between human and camels. we were not surprised that our best-fitting time-series model did not include seasonality for Makkah. however, there are distinct cultural and socio-economic differences between the three regions. reporting bias and lack of information on the time of implementation of intervention measures might substantially bias the estimates of our temporal analyses. asymptomatic and mild cases pose a great challenge for healthcare practitioners. under-reporting bias is expected to be more severe in the earlier years of the epidemic. excluding large peaks (which represents time interval with more than 20 cases) represents another important limitation. our best-fitting ARIMA model inferred statistically significant biannual seasonality in Riyadh region, a region characterised by heavy seasonal camel-related activities. however, no statistical evidence of seasonality was identified in eastern province and Makkah."}
