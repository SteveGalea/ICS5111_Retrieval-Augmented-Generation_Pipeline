{"summary": "transmission of influenza viruses can occur by three routes: direct contact of infectious secretions with mucus membranes of the upper respiratory tract (URT), contact of virus-containing large droplet sprays with surfaces of the URT, and inhalation of small aerosols and droplet nuclei. the relative importance of each transmission route is poorly understood and probably varies depending on virus strain, environmental conditions, etc. both coughing and breathing are important activities in airborne influenza virus transmission. lednicky and Loeb (7) isolated viable influenza A H3N2 virus from an SKC BioSampler and a personal cascade impactor sampler. PCR methods provide a total count of the viral genomes (genome equivalents) but do not discriminate between genomes corresponding to viable versus nonviable viruses. it is hard to know whether the low infectious virus recoveries reported in the literature are meaningful or due to poor collection methodologies for airborne viruses. syncytia consistent with those expected for human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) were also observed in a549, LLC-MK2 and Vero cells regardless of trypsin content. no CPE were observed in mock-inoculated cells or in control runs. rounded floating dead cells and large emptied areas of the growing surface are visible. a negative-control reaction is shown in the left panel. influenza A and B antigens were detected in cell culture medium. this content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

DISCUSSION We evaluated the virus aerosol collection capabilities of a novel air sampler (VIVAS) and a standard air sampler (BioSampler) in a student infirmary center during a late-onset influenza outbreak that spanned from mid-February to early April 2016. in the first experiment (11 March 2016), infectious influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 viruses and influenza B viruses and RSV were present in the collection medium of the VIVAS in 3/3 air the VIVAS has a higher physical collection efficiency than the BioSampler for particles as small as 8 nm due to the amplification results. the location chosen was a student infirmary, the agent was influenza A or B virus, and the emitting source was a person with an active respiratory infection. in another three sets of air samplings performed using both the BioSampler and the VIVAS on three different days after the influenza outbreak, no viable respiratory viruses were isolated. influenza season was near peak levels from 6 to 12 March (23), and influenza viruses were isolated in our air samplings on 11 and 28 March. unlike influenza virus A/California/07/2009(pdmH1N1), the viruses isolated in this work were from pdm09 HA clade 6B.1 (Text S1). changes were observed in the amino acid sequence of the NA protein (Table S4) and matrix (M) protein (Table S4). clade 3C has three subdivisions, 3C.1, 3C.2, and 3C.3. the virus strain of the 2015\u20132016 Northern Hemisphere vaccine was A/Texas/50/2012(H3N2) vaccine of 2015\u20132016 had a Yamagata-lineage strain. some/most of the influenza virus vaccines were not a good match for the influenza viruses in circulation in early 2016 in Florida. some of the viruses are found in particle sizes termed \u201cfine\u201d particles. viruses, adenovirus, coronavirus, human parainfluenza virus, and respiratory syncytial virus were successfully collected by the VIVAS. the device is potentially useful for the general surveillance of airborne viruses. the bioSampler is presently considered the reference air sampler for the collection of airborne bacteria and fungi. it has been used in attempts to collect virus aerosols (7, 34) to avoid discrepancies in virus concentrations due to sampling location, the inlets of the VIVAS and the BioSampler were bound together. the air samplers were positioned within a waiting room on the second floor. on 28 May, the waiting room was visibly crowded, and as people waited for medical attention, many were observed to be coughing and sneezing. in contrast, relatively few patients were present on 8 April. concentrated air sample collection media were inoculated onto a variety of readily available (\u201cstandard\u201d) cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for virus isolation attempts. the term \u201cculturable\u201d refers to those viruses that can be isolated and propagated using standard cell lines and methods. the inoculated cells were incubated at 35\u00b0C. plates were monitored daily for signs of virus-induced CPE. noninfected cells were maintained and refed in parallel for comparison. a commercial solid-phase ELISA (QuickVue influenza A and B kit; Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA) was used per the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to quickly detect influenza virus in the spent media of cell cultures that exhibited typical influenza virus-induced CPE (7). the ELISA did not distinguish between influenza A virus types H1 and H3. adenovirus C (type 5), human parainfluenza viruses 2, 3, and 4a, human coronaviruses 229E and NL63, and human metapneumovirus were identified using the GenMark system. the student health care center at the university of Florida (Gainesville, FL) has its own heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system. the bioSampler is presently considered the reference air sampler for the collection of airborne bacteria and fungi. it has been used in attempts to collect virus aerosols (7, 34) the inlets of the VIVAS and the BioSampler were operated at a flow rate of 8 liters/min. the air samplers were placed within a waiting room on the second floor. on 28 May, the waiting room was visibly crowded, and as people waited for medical attention, many were observed to be coughing and sneezing. on 8 April, relatively few patients were present. concentrated air sample collection media were inoculated onto a variety of readily available (\u201cstandard\u201d) cell lines obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) for virus isolation attempts. the term \u201cculturable\u201d refers to those viruses that can be isolated and propagated using standard cell lines and methods. the inoculated cells were incubated at 35\u00b0C. plates were monitored daily for signs of virus-induced CPE. noninfected cells were maintained and refed in parallel for comparison. a commercial solid-phase ELISA (QuickVue influenza A and B kit;
