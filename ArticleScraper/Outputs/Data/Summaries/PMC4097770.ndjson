{"summary": "a novel human coronavirus, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was isolated from a patient suffering from severe pneumonia, who later died of respiratory and renal failure. a cluster of 23 laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infections were identified between 1 April and 23 May 2013. as of 27 March 2014, 206 infections, including 86 deaths, had been reported. the treatment was initiated soon (8 h) after challenge and the disease in the macaques was mild to moderate in severity. there are currently no approved antiviral treatments for any human coronavirus infection. it is urgent to find an approach to rapidly develop potent therapeutics against MERS-CoV. three of these antibodies have exceptionally potent neutralization activity against MERS-CoV. they could be useful for prophylaxis of MERS and treatment of MERS-CoV-infected patients. libraries of 1012 phage-displayed Fabs were incubated with 5, 3, 3, and 1 g of RBD for 2 h at room temperature during the first, second, third, and fourth rounds of biopanning. the heavy chain variable domain (VH) and light chain variable domain (VL) of these clones were sequenced. fected TG1 cells were detected with anti-M13-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) polyclonal Ab (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) for the competition ELISA, 20 nM Fabs were incubated with serially diluted IgG1s. the plate was coated with recombinant soluble DPP4. the reference flow cell was treated with the amine coupling reagent without exposure to the RBD. the chip was regenerated with 10 mM glycine, pH 2.5, and 1 M NaCl. isolate was cultured in vero cells with modified Eagle medium (DMEM) at 37\u00b0C. serial 2-fold-diluted MAbs m336, m337, and m338 were prepared in duplicate in a 96-well tissue culture plate in MEM supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum (FCS) m338 were selected without any steric clashes at the interface. the top 10 MERS-CoV RBD docked complexes were visually scrutinized. plasmid encoding residues 360 to 601 fused with Avi tag was transfected into 293 Freestyle cells (Invitrogen) libraries of 1012 phage-displayed Fabs were incubated with 5, 3, 3, and 1 g of RBD for 2 h at room temperature during the first, second, third, and fourth rounds of biopanning. both Fabs and IgG1s were expressed and purified. phage from each round of panning (polyclonal phage ELISA) were detected with anti-M13-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) polyclonal Ab (Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ) for the competition ELISA, 20 nM Fabs were incubated with serially diluted IgG1s. mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 5.0, immobilized on a CM5 sensor chip. the chip was treated with the amine coupling reagent without exposure to the RBD. the chip was regenerated with 10 mM glycine, pH 2.5, and 1 M NaCl. a clinical isolate of MERS-CoV was cultured in vero cells with DMEM. two or 3 days after virus inoculation, culture supernatants were collected. antibody-virus mixtures were added into a 96-well microtiter plate. the 3D models of MAbs from m336, m337, and m338 were selected without any clashes at the VH/VL interface. the top 10 MERS-CoV RBD docked complexes among the predictions were visually scrutinized. three Fabs designated m336, m337, and m338 had the lowest concentrations of 50% binding (EC50s) all three MAbs emerged from the common germ line VH gene 1-69 (Table 1). Fabs m336, m337, and m338 were selected for further characterization and converted to an IgG1 format. the MAbs bound with high (pM) avidity (dissociation constant [Kd], 9.94 1011 to 8.23 1010 M) did not. their high affinity/avidity and specificity suggest potential use as research reagents for exploring mechanisms of viral entry. single-round HIV luciferase reporter viruses pseudotyped with MERS-CoV S protein were tested for neutralization sensitivity against increasing concentrations of MAbs. the most potent MAb, m336, inhibited >90% MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at a concentration of 0.039 g/ml. the negative-control IgG1, m610.27, was unable to inhibit the infection. specific MAbs competed with the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 for binding to the virus. we used several S1 fragments, a soluble DPP4 (sDPP4), alanine mutagenesis, and molecular modeling to define epitopes of the antibodies. m336, m337, and m338 bound potently to fragments containing the RBD but not to fragments lacking the RBD. m336 IgG1 was slightly more potent than m337 and m338 in blocking the binding of RBD to the receptor. the IC50s of m336, m337, and m338 were 0.034, 0.044, and 0.041 g/ml, respectively. these results suggest that the MAbs neutralize the virus by competing with the receptor for binding to the RBD. a panel of alanine-scanning mutants was developed, guided by structural information available for the RBD. Binding of m336 to RBD with mutated residues L506A, D510A, E536A, D539A, and V555A was considerably reduced. the most potent MAb, m336, uniquely lost binding to the mutant. canonical structures for HCDR3 of RBD-specific MAbs were grafted from structurally known antibodies with the same HCDR3 lengths. the HCDR3 template (PDB code 3EYF) also had centrally located cysteine residues that formed a disulfide bond which could be used to stabilize the conformation of HCDR3 with a length of 18 amino acids. docked complexes of MERS-CoV RBD with MAbs m336 (A), m337 (B), and m338 (C) may have implications for design of vaccine immunogens and small-molecule drugs.

Fabs m336, m337, and m338 were selected for further characterization. in Fig. 3A, all three RBD-specific MAbs showed exceptionally potent neutralization activity. the most potent MAb, m336, inhibited >90% MERS-CoV pseudovirus infection at a concentration of 0.039 g/ml. the negative-control IgG1, m610.27, was unable to inhibit the infection. m336 (B), m337 (C), and m338 (D) bound to S18-725-Fc, S358-588-Fc, and S377-662-Fc but not to S726-1295-Fc or S18-353-Fc. m336 (B), m337 (C), and m338 (D) bound to S18-725-Fc, S358-588-Fc, S m336 IgG1 was slightly more potent than m337 and m338 in blocking the binding of RBD to the soluble DPP4 receptor. the IC50s of m336, m337, and m338 were 0.034, 0.044, and 0.041 g/ml, respectively. these results suggest that the MAbs neutralize the virus by competing with the receptor for binding to the RBD. D510A, E536A, D539A, W553A, and V555A were significantly reduced. binding of m337 to mutants L506A, D510A, E553A, and V555A was significantly reduced. the most potent MAb, m336, uniquely lost binding to the E536/D539 mutant, indicating that these RBD residues are crucial for interactions with m336. the HCDR3 template (PDB code 3EYF) also had centrally located cysteine residues that formed a disulfide bond. the other two MAbs, m337 and m338, had multiple tyrosine residues within the HCDR3s that might be structural significance as well as active antigen recognition sites.
