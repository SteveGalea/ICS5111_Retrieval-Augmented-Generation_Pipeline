{"summary": "in 1965, Egeberg et al first described a parentage with inherited antithrombin deficiency. the antithrombin deficiency is an autosomal dominant genetic disease. evidence on the genetic pathogenesis of VTE is rarely identified in a majority of VTE patients. in 2010, we detected virus-like microorganisms in the lymphocytes of a young pulmonary hypertension patient with increased D-Dimer. peripheral decreased CD3+ and CD8+ level also indicated virus infection caused significantly compromised function of T cells10. in 2011, we reported the decreased CD3+ and CD8+ level with an increased CD4+/CD8+ ratio in a group of CTEPH patients. 18 years were recruited from Tongji Hospital, including 26 males and 30 females. the diagnosis of acute PE was based on the criteria previously reported 12. malignancies, use of immunosuppresants or autoimmune diseases were excluded in all patients. about 1 g of total RNA was reversely transcribed into double strand cDNA. in vitro amplification was performed with Agilent low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit. modified aaUTP can interact with Cy3 NHS ester forming fluorescent products. fish's exact test was applied for over representation of selected genes in GO biological categories. false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated for all of categories. enrichment represents the degree of gene expression significance. in 56 patients, the CD3+, CD4+, CD8+, and CD19 were detected. the NK cell marker CD16++56+ was detected in 50 patients. no significant difference in age was found between PE patients and control patients. in the PE group, there were 11 males and 9 females, with a mean age of 7014 years (4489 years) there were 13 patients with acute PE and 7 with CTEPH. no significant difference in age was found between PE patients and control patients (P>0.05) total RNA was extracted from mononuclear cells with TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Germany) followed by purification with RNeasy column (QIAGEN) treatment with DNase was performed to avoid the influence by genomic DNA. original signals were obtained Agilent scanner and Feature Extraction software. RT-PCR The spots were randomly selected and their expressions were confirmed by RT-PCR. differentially expressed genes were identified from whole genomes. independent-samples t test was used to compare mRNA levels in samples from PE patients and controls. 750 ng of fluorescent products were fragmented at 60\u00b0C for 17 h at 10 rpm. the chips were washed with Agilent Gene Expression Wash Buffer according to manufacturer's instructions. fish's exact test was applied for over representation of selected genes in GO biological categories. the threshold of significant GO was defined as p-value0.05, FDR0.05 and enrichment parameters. Enrichment represents the degree of gene expression significance. mRNA expressions of neutrophils-related genes were significantly up-regulated in PE group. mRNA expressions of monocytes and macrophages were markedly up-regulated. mRNA expressions of complements related genes were markedly up-regulated. mRNA expressions of genes related to cytokines were markedly up-regulated. mRNA expressions of NK cells related genes were markedly down-regulated. mRNA expressions of NK cells related genes were markedly down-regulated. 30 had aberrant CD4+/CD8+ ratio (decreased in 7 and increased in 23) 17 had aberrant CD19 expression in 56 patients (decreased in 15 and increased in 2). the CD8+ expression was decreased in 25 out of 56 patients(44.6%), the CD8+ and CD16++56+ expressions were decreased in 39 out of 56 patients(69.8%) mRNA expressions of neutrophils-related genes were significantly up-regulated in PE group. mRNA expressions of neutrophils-related genes were markedly up-regulated. mRNA expressions of monocytes and macrophages were significantly up-regulated. mRNA expressions of NK cells related genes markedly down-regulated. expression of killer lectin-like receptor (KLR) markedly down-regulated. mRNA expressions of NK cells related genes only CD86 mRNA expression was significantly up-regulated. expression in 50 patients (decreased in 14 and increased in 9) and 17 had aberrant CD19 expression in 56 patients (decreased in 15 and increased in 2). the CD8+ expression was decreased in 25 out of 56 patients(44.6%), the CD8+ and CD16++56+ expressions were decreased in 34 out of 56 patients(69.8%) mRNA expressions of genes associated with innate immunity were markedly up-regulated and those related to the cellular immunity of T cells and NK cells significantly down-regulated. cytological experiment indicated 6 parameters related to immune function were abnormal in 53 of 56 VTE patients. in 53 of 56 VTE patients, the expressions of CD3+, CD8+, CD16++56+ and CD19 were down-regulated or the CD4+/CD8+ ratio was abnormal. symptomatic VTE is associated with the decrease of innate immunity and adaptive immunity in more than 2/3 of patients. innate immune response occurs within 0-4 hours after infection. early innate immune response occurs 4-96 hours after infection18, 19. During the 3-year follow up period, 21 VTE patients (40%; including those died) were lost to follow up."}
