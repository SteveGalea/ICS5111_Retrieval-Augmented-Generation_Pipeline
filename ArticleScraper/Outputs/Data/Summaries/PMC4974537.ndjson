{"summary": "hantaviruses infect rodents, bats, shrews, and moles. hantaviruses infect rodents, bats, shrews, and moles. the glycoproteins mediate the first step in the bunyavirus replication cycle. they are synthesized as a precursor protein, Gn/Gc, in the secretory pathway of infected cells. the cleavage step is executed by a cellular enzyme, signal peptidase [15,16,17], during import of the Gn/Gc precursor into the endoplasmic reticulum. several phleboviruses are important human pathogens. RVFV causes severe diseases in ruminants and humans in the middle east. severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) was discovered as a novel agent responsible for cases of severe fever in Asia. the fusion of viral and endosomal membranes allows release of the viral ribonucleoprotein complexes into the cytoplasm. the viral nucleoprotein and the viral polymerase are synthesized in the cytoplasm where they form together with newly produced genomic RNA (gRNA) ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes. vesicles are transported to the plasma membrane where the virions are released by exocytosis. the order is imposed by the configuration of Gn and Gc proteins in the viral envelope. the icosahedral lattice is composed of 110 hexameric and 12 pentameric capsomers. the proteins mediate viral entry into target cells and cause assembly and budding of progeny particles in infected cells. for hantaviruses, a role for 1-3 integrins in host cell entry has been reported. glycan-protein interactions seem to play a prominent role in phlebovirus entry. tetramerization of DC-SIGN is required for avid ligand binding. phleboviruses are transmitted by arthropod bites. phleboviruses are transmitted by arthropod bites. lectins like DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN) and LSECtin were shown to promote entry of several viruses [58,59,60], indicating that these viruses most likely also use other receptors for infectious entry. a recent report showed that DC-SIGNR, which shares 77% amino acid sequence identity with DC-SIGN but is expressed on different cells, can markedly augment phlebovirus entry into cell lines. HS is a glycosaminoglycan (GAG), an unbranched polysaccharide composed of disaccharide repeats. it can be linked to a protein via O-glycosylation, resulting in the formation of a proteoglycan. HS, but not complex N-glycans, is required for efficient cellular entry of RVFV [65] a role of HS in RVFV entry was also identified in a screen of haploid cells for factors required for RVFV spread in mosquitos. HS-dependence for entry of RVFV did not result from cell culture adaptation since primary isolates were found to depend on HS for entry. however, the cell line dependence of the role of HS in RVFV entry suggests that GAGs might serve as attachment factors rather than receptors. Binding of SFTSV to cells augmented total expression of NMMHC-IIA. increased surface levels within minutes, indicating that SFTSV manipulates NMMHC-IIA trafficking to ensure efficient entry. point mutations in NMMHC-IIA found to be associated with thrombocytopenia. internalized UUKV is then transported into early and late endosomes, where low pH triggers membrane fusion. expression of vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) was required for UUKV infection. virus particles were found in VAMP3-positive late endosomal compartments. three classes of viral proteins that can fuse viruses with cells have been identified. a fusion peptide or an internal fusion loop is propelled towards the target cell membrane and inserted into the bilayer. a back-folding reaction brings the viral nucleic acid into the host cell cytoplasm. SFV Gc sequences potentially involved in membrane fusion were found to be conserved among bunyavirus Gc proteins. elucidation of the structure of the ectodomain of RVFV Gc in the pre-fusion state was provided by the elucidation of the structure of the ectodomain. osomotropic agents, which elevate intravesicular pH, block phlebovirus entry [53,86]. exposure of Gn/Gc-expressing cells to low pH is sufficient to trigger Gc. ensuing conformational changes are irreversible, since triggering in the absence of target cells abrogates virus infectivity [86]. IFITM proteins modulate membrane properties to inhibit viral entry is not clear. but alteration of membrane curvature and/or fluidity due to IFITM insertion and IFITM-IFITM interactions as possible mechanisms has been proposed [92,93]. attachment factors and receptors phlebovirus entry into cells commences with binding of particles to components of the plasma membrane. for hantaviruses, a role for 1-3 integrins in host cell entry has been reported. glycan-protein interactions appear to play a prominent role in phlebovirus entry. phleboviruses are transmitted by arthropod bites. phleboviruses are transmitted by arthropod bites. phleboviruses are transmitted by arthropod bites. phleboviruses are transmitted by arthropod bites. lectins like the DC-SIGN-related protein DC-SIGNR (L-SIGN) and LSECtin were shown to promote entry of several viruses. a recent report showed that DC-SIGNR, which shares 77% amino acid sequence identity with DC-SIGN, can markedly augment phlebovirus entry into cell lines which are otherwise barely susceptible. HS is an unbranched polysaccharide composed of disaccharide repeats. it can be linked to a protein via O-glycosylation, resulting in the formation of a proteoglycan. HS, but not complex N-glycans, is required for efficient cellular entry. a role of HS in RVFV entry was also identified within a screen of haploid cells for factors required for RVFV spread. HS-dependence for RVFV entry did not result from cell culture adaptation since primary isolates were found to depend on HS for entry. separate work showed that TOSV uses GAGs for efficient cell entry. the protein is normally localized in the cytoplasm, indicating that SFTSV manipulates NMMHC-IIA trafficking to ensure efficient entry. it has been suggested that SFTSV interactions with NMMHC-IIA might directly contribute to viral pathogenesis [71]. expression of vesicle-associated membrane protein 3 (VAMP3) was required for UUKV infection. virus particles were found in VAMP3-positive late endosomal compartments. this is likely because of its role in microtubule organization and endosomal maturation. three classes of viral proteins that can fuse viruses with cells have been identified. the last sequence of the phlebovirus entry cascade is the fusion of the viral envelope with an endosomal membrane. a back-folding reaction brings the viral nucleic acid into the host cell cytoplasm. phlebovirus Gc proteins have a fold characteristic of class II membrane fusion proteins. elucidation of the structure of the ectodomain of RVFV Gc in the pre-fusion state. phlebovirus Gc proteins may employ similar strategies as flavivirus E proteins. no evidence has been reported that Gc proteins must first bind to a receptor or undergo proteolytic activation for subsequent triggering by low pH. phospholipids with negatively charged headgroups were found to promote UUKV Gc-driven fusion in a liposome-based assay [88], suggesting that specific components of the target cell membrane can impact fusion efficiency. IFITM proteins modulate membrane properties to inhibit viral entry. three classes of viral proteins that can fuse viruses with cells have been identified. class II membrane fusion proteins frequently exhibit a parallel orientation relative to the viral membrane. SFV Gc sequences potentially involved in membrane fusion were found to be conserved among bunyavirus Gc proteins. elucidation of the structure of the ectodomain of RVFV Gc in the pre-fusion state. phlebovirus Gc proteins may employ similar strategies as flavivirus E proteins. treatment of target cells with lysosomotropic agents blocks phlebovirus entry. exposure of virions to low pH is sufficient to trigger Gc [74]. no evidence that Gc proteins must first bind to a receptor or undergo proteolytic activation for subsequent triggering by low pH. expression of IFITM2 and IFITM3 was shown to block RVFV entry. more than half of antiviral activity associated with IFN treatment of target cells was found to be due to expression of these proteins. alteration of membrane curvature and/or fluidity due to IFITM insertion and IFITM interactions as possible mechanisms has been proposed. host factor responsible for precursor cleavage is the signal peptidase complex located in the ER membrane [16,17] due to a signal sequence preceding Gn, the nascent precursor polypeptide chain is translocated into the ER lumen. two hydrophobic domains in the Gn/Gc precursor located in the C-terminal parts of Gn and Gc are inserted into the ER membrane. NSm encodes an additional protein upstream of phleboviruses. NSm-Gn/Gc precursor protein is produced by differential use of an AUG triplet as start codon. in the case of RVFV, another two AUG triplets give rise to the expression of a nested set of polyproteins. the antigenomic M-segment RNA serves as a template for viral transcription which results in a single mRNA. UUKV as an example for tick-borne phleboviruses. translation at AUG 1 yields the P78-Gc precursor protein. signal peptidase cleaves the pre-protein after the signal sequences preceding NSm and Gc but not after the signal sequence preceding Gn. both Gn and Gc are type I transmembrane proteins. both proteins interact with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) [116], an enzyme ubiquitously found in the ER which breaks up incorrectly formed disulfide bonds. other proteins involved in correct folding of UUKV Gn and Gc are the chaperones binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP), calnexin, and calreticulin [116,117] phleboviruses bud at the Golgi instead of the plasma membrane. a conserved sequence for this signal could not be identified. a lysine-based putative ER retention/retrieval signal is located in the cytoplasmic tails of phlebovirus Gc proteins. the conserved lysine at position 3 is conserved across the ER. a possible explanation might be the fact that ER retrieval signals are not always functional when they are located in short cytoplasmic tails or near amphipathic helices. the cytoplasmic tail of phlebovirus Gc proteins is very short (e.g., only five amino acids for UUKV) and the cytoplasmic tail of Gn is much longer (e.g., 81 amino acids for UUKV) the cytoplasmic tail of Gn is very short (e.g., only five amino acids for UUKV) phlebovirus Gn proteins contain the di-leucine motif. in the case of RVFV, the di-leucine motif is replaced by phenylalanine and isoleucine. for UUKV the Gn and Gc glycoproteins are sufficient for efficient formation and release of virus-like particles. local accumulation of glycoproteins in the Golgi is a prerequisite for binding of the nucleoprotein or the RNP. it can therefore be assumed that the interaction of RNP and Env proteins is the driving force for the morphogenesis and budding of phlebovirus particles in the Golgi. the precursor is rapidly cleaved, indicating cotranslational cleavage. the host factor responsible for precursor cleavage is the signal peptidase complex located in the ER membrane. the nascent precursor polypeptide chain is translocated from the cytoplasm into the ER lumen. the glycoproteins Gn and Gc encode an additional protein upstream of NSm. an NSm-Gn/Gc precursor protein is produced by differential use of an AUG triplet as start codon. the polyprotein precursors are all cleaved by signal peptidase to generate the accessory proteins P78 (Nsm-Gn), P14 (NSm) and P13 (NSm\u2019) the antigenomic M-segment RNA serves as a template for viral transcription which results in a single mRNA. the M-segment encodes only the two glycoproteins Gn and Gc. translation at AUG 3 results in the expression of an N-terminal truncated NSm protein (NSm\u2019) which is functionally equivalent to full-length NSm. signal peptidase cleaves the pre-protein after the signal sequence preceding NSm and Gc but not after the signal sequence preceding Gn. positions of cysteine residues are highly conserved among phleboviruses. positions of the cysteine residues may be crucial for correct folding. both proteins interact with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) [116]. phleboviruses bud at the Golgi instead of the plasma membrane. a conserved sequence for this signal could not be identified. a lysine-based putative ER retention/retrieval signal is located in the short cytoplasmic tail. phlebovirus Gc proteins are conserved in the ER when expressed alone. the conserved lysine is part of a KKXX motif which is the classical ER retention motif for transmembrane proteins. ER retrieval signals are not always functional when they are located in short cytoplasmic tails or near amphipathic helices. Gn carries mostly N-linked oligosaccharides of the complex type, indicating extensive oligosaccharide processing in the Golgi. steric occlusion seems to prevent processing of N-glycans attached to UUKV Gc. in the case of RVFV, the di-leucine motif is replaced by phenylalanine and isoleucine [124] for UUKV the Gn and Gc glycoproteins are sufficient for efficient formation and release of virus-like particles. for RVFV the formation of virus-like particles in the absence of RNP is inefficient [27,124] phlebovirus Gc proteins are class II viral membrane fusion proteins. emergence of new pathogenic tick-borne phleboviruses highlights the importance for this type of research. the mechanism of how glycoproteins and RNPs interact during virus assembly is poorly understood. new insights could provide the basis for the rational design of effective countermeasures against highly pathogenic phleboviruses."}
