{"summary": "study examines the effect of shifting childbirth services from advanced hospitals to local community hospitals. the sample population was tracked over a seven-year period. concerns have been raised about maintaining the quality of maternity care. regionalization of perinatal care has been established to improve perinatal health care and decrease neonatal mortality. studies have demonstrated that the relative risk for low birthweight infants in local community hospitals is significantly higher than that in advanced hospitals. the data on the outcome of infants of normal birthweight are still inconclusive [7-15] expectant mothers began seeking maternity services at local community hospitals instead of advanced hospitals to avoid being exposed to SARS patients. this change in expectant mothers' preference of healthcare providers led to an increase of 7.1 % and 2.1% of the market share of total childbirth deliveries in clinics and district hospitals. this large shift in childbirth services to local community hospitals has led to serious concerns about quality of care [17]. a total of 22 counties were included in the analysis. we excluded the data from three isolated islands with no advanced medical institutions. the dependent variables included monthly county neonatal mortality rates. the number of childbirths from 1998 to 2004 was 1,798,369. the number of neonatal mortality cases was 5,747. table 2 shows a decrease in neonatal mortality rates over time. despite increased use of local community hospitals, neonatal mortality during the SARS epidemic was lower, even though the difference was insignificant. the univariate statistics of standardized predicted errors of monthly county mortality rates are based on the model based on the total sample during the years 1998\u20132004 SARS period. the aggregated data shows negative predicated errors during the SARS period of May 2003\u2013August 2003. the aggregated data of counties with large hospitals demonstrates a significant predicted error in July 2003. in counties with advanced hospitals of more than 1,000 beds, neonatal mortality was significantly reduced in July 2003, despite increased use of childbirth services. regionalized perinatal care is well-established for high-risk deliveries. however, the literature shows conflicting results regarding the outcome of normal birthweight deliveries in local community hospitals. study of the impact of the SARS epidemic on childbirth shows a 2.2% increase in the cesarean section rate in medical centers, but no increase in the cesarean section rate in local community hospitals during the SARS period. results contradict predictions of a worse outcome for low-risk deliveries in local community or small hospitals. this study applied a population-based approach to research the change in neonatal mortality during the increased use of local community hospitals associated with the SARS epidemic. this study's large sample size of 1,848 observations allows us to demonstrate clearly that the shifting of childbirth services did not increase the risk of neonatal deaths. regionalized perinatal care has efficiently allocated expensive resources to high-risk infants who are most in need of help. this study shows that it is possible to successfully shift low-risk deliveries from advanced hospitals to local community hospitals without impairing childbirth outcomes. the shift allows for a more efficient use because low-risk deliveries seldom need high-technological medical facilities, such as NICUs. authors' contributions SYW planned and designed the study, collected and analyzed the data, interpreted the results, and led the writing of the article. all authors reviewed and approved the final draft of the manuscript."}
