{"summary": "Selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) attract much attention in the biomedical field. they are used as carriers of drugs in current research studies. se@RBV nanoparticles protect cells during infection in vitro. the novel H1N1 influenza pandemic that erupted in north America caused more than 575,400 deaths in 2009.3 Vaccines and antiviral drugs are the main methods to prevent and control influenza. current therapeutic strategies include the M2 ion channel inhibitors, neuraminidase inhibitors, and broad-spectrum antiviral RNA polymerase inhibitors. selenium nanoparticles (SeNPs) have their own characteristics against virus infection. first, selenium status may affect the function of cells of both innate and adaptive immunity. selenium deficiency is supposed to be related to virus infection. the relationship between the antiviral activity and caspase-3 apoptotic pathway was explored in both in vitro and in vivo experiments. a one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction kit was acquired from Takara. -8, phosphorylated p53 (p-p53), Bax, phosphorylated p38 (p-p38), phosphorylated Junamino-terminal kinase (p-JNK) and -actin monoclone antibodies were supplied by Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA, USA) the supernatant was replaced with DMEM containing 2 g/mL trypsin. the TCID50 was calculated using the Reed\u2013Muench method. caspase-3 activity was mensurated using a caspase-3 activity detection kit. cells were lysed with radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. images were visualized on a Tanon gel imaging system. the lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin. sections were embedded in wax and cut into 5 m slices for H&E staining, tunel test, and immunohistochemistry staining. differences were considered statistically significant at P0.05 (*) or P0.01 (**). a one-way analysis of variance were used to evaluate variance. dimethylbenzene, 3% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine (DAB) and mounting medium were bought from GBCBIO Technologies (Guangdong, People\u2019s Republic of China) Synthesis of SeNPs loaded with RBV was detected using inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry. virus was used for in vitro study at the titer of 100 TCID50/mL, 1000 TCID50/mL for in vivo experiments. cell viability test Cytotoxicity of Se@RBV was detected by MTT assay. lysates were separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. bands on polyvinylidene difluoride membranes were immunoblotted with primary antibodies. images were visualized on a Tanon gel imaging system. lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 24 hours, dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, and embedded in paraffin. sections were embedded in wax and cut into 5 m slices for H&E staining, tunel test, and immunohistochemistry staining. the average sizes of Se@RBV and Se@RBV were 65 nm and 100 nm respectively. the diameter of Se@RBV is smaller than SeNPs alone. the particle size of Se@RBV contributed to the stable nanostructure. cytopathic effect of MDCK cells was detected by MTT assay. cell viability without treatment was 48.4%, and cells treated with Se@RBV achieved viability of 68.5% and 65.2% respectively. the green coumarin-6 labeled Se@RBV accumulated on MDCK cells membrane and moved to lysosomes labeled by red lyso tracker. Approximately 60 minutes later, Se@RBV escaped from lysosomes and released into the cytoplasm. pase-3 activity of cells infected by H1N1 virus without treatment was 352% of the control group in which cells were uninfected. the se@RBV-treated group markedly reduced to 208%. it suggested that H1N1 virus probably induced apoptosis through caspase-3 and was effectively suppressed by Se@RBV. MDCK cells infected with H1N1 virus were treated with RBV, SeNPs, and Se@RBV for 24 hours. proteins related to apoptosis signaling pathways were detected. p-JNK, p-p38, phosphorylated 38, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, phosphorylated 53, p53, se@RBV prevents DNA damage during apoptosis. cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP, p-p53, p-JNK, and p-p38 proteins were found positive for H1N1 virus infection. Se@RBV and Se@RBV appeared monodisperse and spherical. the diameter of Se@RBV was 200 nm, while that of Se@RBV 100 nm. TEM images of SeNPs and Se@RBV by EDX. cytopathic effect of MDCK cells was detected by MTT assay. MDCK cells infected with H1N1 virus were untreated (Mock) or treated with coumarin-6-loaded Se@RBV for 90 minutes. cell viability (A) and virus titer of the culture supernatant (B) were detected. caspase-3 activation in vitro is induced during H1N1 virus infection. activity of caspase-3 was detected, and expression of cleaved caspase-3 or cleaved PARP was investigated. cleaved caspase-8 is an apoptosis initiator. se@RBV restrained the caspase-3-mediated mitochondrial apoptosis pathway by inhibiting the activation of caspase-8. cells without infection and treatment were performed as control. p53 benefits the expression of the protein and promotes the apoptosis process after phosphorylation. both regulation of caspase-8 and Bax resisted activation of caspase-3. p38 and JNK signaling pathways took part in the restriction of apoptosis with Se@RBV. mice were infected with H1N1 virus and treated with RBV, SeNPs, and Se@RBV, followed by H&E staining, tunel analyses, and immunohistochemical test of the lungs. p-p38 proteins were found positive for H1N1 virus infection. treatment with Se@RBV reduced the appearance visibly. this result coincident with the previous in vitro study. seNPs loaded with RBV restrain apoptosis induced by H1N1 influenza virus infection through the caspase-3 signaling pathway."}
