{"summary": "bile culture identified a monomicrobial infection with Providencia rettgeri. the cat was treated with oral pradofloxacin for 4 weeks and remained well 4 months later. this is the first report of a Providencia species causing clinical illness in a cat. hair cat was presented after a generalised seizure was observed at home. a second seizure was observed after admission to hospital. the cat had indoor and outdoor access, and was fed a balanced cat food. prednisolone (Pred-X) was initiated (1.5 mg/kg PO q12h) with an improved appetite and a mild increase in weight noted. the cat\u2019s body condition score remained suboptimal at 3/9. early renal disease was suspected, with ongoing monitoring planned. phenobarbitone and focal left retinal detachment were administered intravenously. a second seizure was observed following admission to hospital. a complete neurological examination was not performed on admission. intravenous (IV) fluid therapy with potassium supplementation was commenced overnight owing to increased depression and the development of complete anorexia. by day 3, the cat was laterally recumbent and pyrexic with clinically apparent jaundice. the cat was treated with IV Hartmann\u2019s solution with potassium supplemented at 20 mmol/l to correct dehydration and hypokalaemia. a single organism, P rettgeri, was identified. the organism was resistant to -lactam antimicrobials and tetracycline. progressive change in liver enzyme activity over time Day 2 Day 3 Day 12 Day 15 Day 39 Day 67 ALT (RI 12\u2013130 U/l) NA 4166 1674 792 136 108 ALP (RI 14\u2013111 U/l) NA 133 303 144 69 73 TBil (RI 0\u201315 mol/l) clinical signs of neutrophilic cholangitis are non-specific and can include fever and lethargy, vomiting, anorexia and weight loss. sensitivity is reported for aspartate transaminase and ALT, but these enzymes appear the most sensitive in the identification of neutrophilic cholangitis. pathogen, P rettgeri, in this cat highlights the need for culture and sensitivity information. the organism belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae group, which consists of Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Serratia and Providencia (CESP) species. most common cause of retinal detachment in a geriatric cat is hypertension. renal disease was suspected in our cat owing to the history of poorly concentrated urine. urea nitrogen, creatinine and serum dimethylarginine remained normal. 78% of human patients with acute cholangitis had received antimicrobial therapy that did not appropriately cover all isolates later cultured from bile. metronidazole was not effective in 18/19 cases where it was commenced and, as a result, was not recommended as a first-line therapy. guide appropriate therapy. guide appropriate therapy."}
