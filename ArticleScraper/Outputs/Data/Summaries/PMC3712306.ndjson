{"summary": "the 2002/2003 outbreak of SARS has demonstrated human vulnerability to coV epidemics. coVs are members of the Coronaviridae family. they contain a large positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 30 kb. there are seven major Cyps in humans-cyclophilin A (CypA), cyclophilin B (CypB), cyclophilin C (CypC), cyclophilin D (CypD), cyclophilin 40 (Cyp40) and cyclophilin NK (CypNK) they are thought to be involved in diverse signaling pathways, including mitochondrial apoptosis [7,8], RNA splicing [9,10 CsA suppresses the replication of various kinds of CoVs. feline coV (FCoV) is classified into two biotypes, the ubiquitous feline enteric CoV (FECV) and infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) the inhibition effect of CsA on FCoV does not involve the NF-AT pathway and its related immunosuppressive effects. we then examined whether the suppressive effects of CsA on FCoV replication depend on the P-glycoprotein pathway by incubating FIPV-infected cells with cyclosporin H (CsH); however, no inhibition occurred. approximately 1% to 5% of infected cells remained SARS\u2013CoV positive by immunofluorescence analysis, even at CsA concentrations of up to 64 M. the used virus may have been one of the naturally CsA-resistant viruses that are sometimes present in the virus pool. overexpression of Nsp1 or infection with SARS\u2013CoV strongly increases signaling through the NF-AT pathway and enhances the induction of interleukin-2 in the presence of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. these results suggest that the NF-AT signaling pathway has an influence on the fundamental triggers of immune cell activation. de Wilde et al. recently reported that CsA inhibited arteriviruses. CsA as an immunosuppressive agent and Debio-064 as an non-immunosuppressive agent inhibited EAV and PRRSV replication. the concentration required to inhibit virus replication is different for each virus. the required concentration may also be affected by the use of different cell lines in replication experiments. CD147 (EMMPRIN), a type I transmembrane protein, has been identified as the main signaling receptor for extracellular CypA. none of the SARS\u2013CoV proteins directly bound to CD147, the N protein of SARS\u2013CoV bound to CypA, which interacted with CD147, by surface plasmon resonance analysis. the CD147\u2013CypA complex plays a critical role in HIV-1 infection. it could induce phosphorylation of the matrix protein (MA) to regulate the detachment of the reverse transcriptase complex from the membrane or promote transition from the step of hemifusion. it is proposed that CD147\u2013CypA interaction might indirectly affect capsid conformation. inhibition effects of virus replication by CsA treatment and knockdown Cyps. inhibition of virus replication by CsA treatment Knockdown CypB Ref."}
