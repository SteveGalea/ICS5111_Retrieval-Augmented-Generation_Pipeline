{"summary": "the EBOV pathogenesis starts with uncontrolled viral replication and subversion of both the innate and adaptive host immune response. the multifunctional viral VP35 protein is involved in this process by exerting an antagonistic action against the early antiviral alpha/beta interferon (IFN-/) response. cFv format recognize an active form of EBOV VP35 in ELISA. one antibody also recognizes VP35 in WB. two scFvs were also able to interfere with the intracellular activity of VP35."}
