{"summary": "early essential host defense mechanisms involve induction of alpha/beta interferon (IFNAR) and signaling through the IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR) to upregulate IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) ISG expression is associated with numerous biological activities, including antiviral and immunomodulatory pathways. FN-/ and signaling through IFNAR activate ISGs and the \u201cantiviral state\u201d. PRR activation also activates nuclear factor B (NF-B)-regulated genes. thereby inducing proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines to facilitate recruitment of innate and adaptive effector cells. matitis virus (VSV) and theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) suggested that astrocytes, not neurons, are the main source of IFN- expression. both microglia and astrocytes express various PRRs. astrocytes regulate CNS homeostasis, support neuronal function, and participate in formation and maintenance of the blood-brain barrier. murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 infects microglia, astrocyte, neurons, and oligodendroglia following intracranial (i.c.) administration. MHVs are at best poor inducers of IFN-/ (28\u201330), but they do induce IFN- in microglia/macrophages (18). defective IFN- signaling was implicated by impaired induction of IFN--dependent MHC class II expression on microglia. RESULTS MHV strain A59 induces type I IFN in the CNS coincident with viral replication. brains from uninfected wild-type mice were harvested out to day 21 p.i. brains from naive and infected mice were harvested at indicated times p.i. analyzed for viral nucleocapsid protein (A59-N), Ifn1, Ifn4, Ifn5, and Ifn mRNAs. increased viral N mRNA in microglia relative to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mRNAs in either glia population revealed viral replication in both microglia and astrocytes at days 3 and 5 p.i. and a decline by day 7 p.i. individual ISGs were not affected by virus infection in microglia but increased modestly in astrocytes. MHV CNS infection has been shown to strongly induce IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit1 and Ifit2) and 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (Oas2) transcripts. microglia and astrocytes were isolated by FACS from brains of naive or infected GFAP-GFP mice (n = 5 or 6) at the indicated times p.i. based on CD45int CD11b+ and CD45 GFAP+. both plots are from total live cells. basal Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3 transcript levels were significantly lower in astrocytes than in microglia. however, astrocytes rapidly upregulated Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3 mRNAs to levels observed in microglia as early as day 3 p.i. all three PRR transcripts declined by day 7 p.i., reflecting the decline in IFN-/. microglia and astrocytes were isolated by FACS from brains of naive or MHV A59-infected GFAP-GFP mice. they were analyzed for transcripts encoding RNA-sensing PRRs (Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3) and transcription factors (Irf3, Irf7) by RT-PCR. mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice developed severe encephalitis and succumbed to infection by day 7 p.i. the mortality compared to that of IFNAR/ mice infected with a similar virus dose (31) supported astrocytes as critical, but not the only, contributors to early IFNAR-dependent protection. infectious virus was measured in brain supernatants. the virus loads were comparable in both groups at day 3 p.i. but reached 5-log10-higher levels in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice than in IFNARfl/fl mice by day 5 p.i. brains from MHV A59-infected IFNARfl/fl and mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice were analyzed for mRNA levels by quantitative RT-PCR. data represent means SEM for n = 4 mice per time point from one experiment representative of two independent experiments. MHV A59 infects multiple CNS cell types, including microglia, astrocytes, and neurons. microglia and neurons showed prominent perinuclear cytoplasmic N protein localization, with some extension into processes in microglia. viral Ag was only occasionally detected in the cytoplasm of astrocytes and was localized mainly proximal to, but not overlapping with, astrocytic processes. anti-GFAP Ab used to identify astrocytes stains main stem branches but not the cytoplasm or fine processes of astrocytes. infection of microglia increased from 20% to 30% in astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl/fl mice between days 4 and 6 p.i. infection of microglia increased from 5% to 15% in astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl/fl mice between days 4 and 6 p.i. anti-J3.3 MAb in combination with anti-GFAP, -IBA1, or -NeuN MAb as markers for astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. bar graphs show proportion of N+ GFAP+ or N+ IBA1+ per total N+ area. bar graphs show proportion of N+ GFAP+/GFAP+ or N+ IBA1+/IBA1+ per field in IFNARfl/fl and mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice. data represent means SEM from 3 fields in 2 or 3 slides from 3 mice per group. mRNA levels were similar at day 3 p.i. but increased significantly in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice compared to IFNARfl/fl controls by day 6 p.i. increased viral N mRNA correlated with increased Ifn, Ifn4, and Ifn5 transcripts at day 6 p.i. IFNAR on astrocytes modulates expression of select NF-B-dependent chemokines and the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 (IL-6). transcripts for Cxcl1 and Ccl2, potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes were similar at day 3 p.i. but were significantly upregulated at day 6 p.i. infected mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice exhibit increased CNS neutrophil accumulation and reduced T cell infiltration. Flow cytometry revealed altered chemokine expression patterns indeed affected the composition of inflammatory cells within the CNS. both CD4 and CD8 T cells are essential to reduce infectious MHV. abrogated IFNAR signaling in astrocytes is associated with altered leukocyte accumulation and impaired IFN- signaling in microglia. numbers of infiltrated neutrophils (A), macrophages (B) and CD4 and CD8 T cells (C) within brains of infected IFNARfl/fl and mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice determined by flow cytometry at the indicated time points. mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice were barely induced by IFN-/. mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice failed to upregulate Cxc. mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice failed to upregulate Cxc. mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice do not express IFNAR on astrocytes. l9 mRNA levels were elevated by 2.5-fold in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice by day 6 p.i. but did not increase in IFNARfl/fl mice. poly(IC) alone did not induce Ciita mRNA at 4 h. but it failed to induce Ciita mRNA in cells pretreated with poly(IC) for either 4 or 12 h compared to induction by IFN- treatment alone. short poly(IC) pretreatment suppressed Cxcl9 mRNA induction by IFN-. poly(IC) pretreatment impairs IFN- signaling in macrophages. cultured BMDM were either treated with IFN-only (50 ng/ml) for 18 h or pretreated with poly(IC) (5 g/ml) for 4 or 12 h prior to treatment with IFN- for 18 h. mRNAs had declined to basal levels by day 7 p.i. expression levels declined by day 10 p.i. but remained elevated above background out to day 21 p.i. mRNA peak was delayed and coincided with T cell infiltration. GFAP-GFP mice isolated CD45-negative, green fluorescent protein (GFP)-positive astrocytes and CD45int CD11b+ microglia by fluorescence-activated cell sorting. increased viral N mRNA in either glia population revealed viral replication in both microglia and astrocytes at days 3 and 5 p.i. and a decline by day 7 p.i. MHV CNS infection has been shown to strongly induce IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (Ifit1 and Ifit2) and 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase 2 (Oas2) transcripts. MHV CNS infection has been shown to strongly induce IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats. microglia and astrocytes were isolated by FACS from brains of naive or infected GFAP-GFP mice (n = 5 or 6) at the indicated times p.i. based on CD45int CD11b+ and CD45 GFAP+. both plots are from total live cells. all three PRR transcripts declined by day 7 p.i., reflecting the decline in IFN-/. expression of the cellular kinase Ikk mRNA was gradually increased in both glial populations over time up to day 7 p.i.. expression of the cellular kinase Ikk mRNA was gradually increased in both glial populations over time. microglia and astrocytes were isolated by FACS from brains of naive or MHV A59-infected GFAP-GFP mice. they were analyzed for transcripts encoding RNA-sensing PRRs (Mda5, Rig-I, and Tlr3) and transcription factors (Irf3, Irf7) by RT-PCR. disease onset was similar in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl and IFNARfl/fl mice starting at day 4 p.i. however, in contrast to mild clinical symptoms in IFNARfl/fl mice, mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice developed severe encephalitis. insets show the infected area or cells at higher magnifications. arrow indicates typical neuronal morphology, and the arrowhead indicates glial morphology. infectious virus was measured in brain supernatants. l/fl mice at day 6 p.i. (values of 82 48 versus 5 3) were significantly higher in the CNS (9,013 998 versus 230 55, respectively) there was also no evidence of necrotic foci by gross visual examination. mortality was thus attributed to overwhelming virus spread within the CNS. /fl mice were analyzed for viral N protein in combination with antibodies (Abs) specific for neurons (NeuN), astrocytes (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP]) and microglia/macrophages (IBA1). microglia and neurons showed prominent perinuclear cytoplasmic N protein localization, with some extension into processes in microglia. anti-GFAP Ab used to identify astrocytes stains main stem branches but not the the relative proportion of the dually viral Ag- and IBA1-positive area per total viral Ag-positive area was comparable between groups at both days 4 and 6 p.i. infection of microglia increased from 20% to 30%, but increased from 5% to 15% in astrocytes in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice. IFNAR abrogation in astrocytes results in uncontrolled virus dissemination in astrocytes and to a lesser extent in neurons and microglia. representative staining of viral N protein in various CNS cell types was determined using anti-J3.3 MAb in combination with anti-GFAP, -IBA1 or -NeuN MAb as markers for astrocytes, microglia, and neurons. bar graphs show the proportion of N+ GFAP+/GFAP+ or N+ IBA1+ per field in IFNARfl/fl and mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice. data represent means SEM from 3 fields in 2 or 3 slides from 3 mice per group. viral N mRNA levels were similar at day 3 p.i. but increased significantly in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice compared to IFNARfl/fl controls. innate immunity by IFNAR-competent cells was clearly insufficient to stem viral dissemination throughout the CNS in infected mice. cytes are also potent inducers of chemokines and cytokines (13, 41), and a subset of chemokines, e.g., the neutrophil chemoattractant CXCL1, can be negatively regulated by IFN-/ (42). transcripts for Cxcl1 and Ccl2, potent chemoattractants for neutrophils and monocytes, respectively, were similar at day 3 p.i. but mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice exhibit increased CNS neutrophil accumulation and reduced T cell infiltration. mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice exhibit increased CNS neutrophil accumulation. cells to the CNS parenchyma were ruled out as an explanation of loss of viral control. uncontrolled viral replication in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice despite similar IFN- production thus implied that viral replication overwhelms the T cell response. prominent indicator of IFN--specific responses in microglia/macrophages is induction of the transcription factor class II transactivator (CIITA), a master regulator of MHC class II expression. only 16% of microglia expressed MHC class II in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice, compared to 76% in IFNARfl/fl mice. mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice failed to upregulate Cxcl9 mRNA by day 6 p.i. however, Cxcl10 mRNA levels were elevated by 2.5-fold in mGFAPcre IFNARfl/fl mice by day 6 p.i. poly(IC) administration into the CNS of mice induced Ifn/ mRNA by 4 h, which was sustained out to 12 h (11) BMDM were thus pretreated with poly(IC) for 4 or 12 h and subsequently treated with IFN--only treatment was included as a positive control. the magnitude of IFN-/-mediated suppression of IFN--dependent gene induction depends on other regulatory elements in the target gene promoter. the duration and/or level of cell exposure to IFN-/ can substantially diminish responsiveness to temporally lagging IFN-, thereby reducing IFN- protective functions. the critical role of IFNAR signaling in astrocytes to block viral spread was confirmed by rapid virus dissemination throughout the CNS upon abrogation of IFNAR signaling in astrocytes. cells expressing low basal levels of IFN-/ pathway components can nevertheless trigger a protective innate immune response through paracrine IFN-/ signaling. noninfected astrocytes and microglia in close proximity to infected neurons were prominent IFN--producing cells, while IFN- expression by infected neurons was rare (16). the spatial extent of innate protection induced in an infected environment may thus depend on the prominent infected cell type. neutrophils release cytokines which mature antigen-presenting cells. increased mRNAs encoding IL-6 and CCL2 also reactivate T cells. xcl10 mRNA expression in the absence of IFNAR on astrocytes implied that IFN- signaling in astrocytes remained intact. earlier reports showed antagonistic effects of IFN-/ on IFN-induced activation of macrophages. one possible mechanism may involve downregulation of the IFN- receptor (IFNGR) IFNARfl/fl mice were engineered to contain loxP sites flanking exon 10 of the IFNAR gene. offspring were genotyped for both presence of Cre recombinase gene and exon 10 deletion from the IFNAR gene. hepato- and neurotropic MHV A59 strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was propagated on delayed brain tumor (DBT) astrocytoma monolayers. clinical disease severity was graded daily using clarified supernatants from brain homogenates prepared as described previously. RPMI, counted, and suspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer. samples were analyzed on a BD Accuri C6 Plus instrument. forward- and side-scatter signals obtained in linear mode. microglia and astrocytes were sorted based on their CD45int CD11b+ and CD45neg GFP+ phenotypes. cells were resuspended in TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and stored at 80\u00b0C. cDNA was synthesized using a DNA-free kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) TGCAACTG-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GCTTCCCTATGGCCCTCTC-3\u2032 (reverse); for the viral nucleocapsid (N) gene, 5\u2032-GCCAAATAATCGCGCTAGAA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-CCGAGCTTGAAACA-3\u2032 (reverse); for Il6, 5\u2032-ACACATGTTCTCTGGGA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AAGTGCATCATCATCATACA-3\u2032 gene expression in total tissue mRNA or glial populations was normalized to the respective GAPDH mRNA expression in each mRNA preparation. the distribution of viral antigen (Ag) was determined using MAb J3.3 specific, for the carboxyl terminus of the viral N protein, as the primary MAb, biotinylated horse anti-mouse IgG as the secondary Ab. apoptosis was determined by staining tissue sections for caspase 3. sections were stained with rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP) sections were stained with rabbit anti-mouse laminin Ab and rat anti-mouse CD3 MAb. IFN- in brain supernatants was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. 96-well plates were coated with 100 l of purified rat anti-mouse IFN- MAb at 4\u00b0C overnight. cells were seeded at a density of 5 106 cells in 10 ml BMDM medium. cells were washed with DMEM, removed by scraping, and plated into 6-well plates. BMDM were confirmed to be >90% F480+and CD11b+ cells. mice were originally purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice for at least 10 generations. IFNARfl/fl mice engineered to contain loxP sites flanking exon 10 of the IFNAR gene were originally produced on the 129/Ola background. mice were infected intracranially at 6 to 7 weeks of age with 2,000 PFU of the hepato- and neurotropic MHV A59 strain expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein. MHV A59 was propagated on delayed brain tumor (DBT) astrocytoma monolayers, and virus titers were determined as described previously. cells were collected from the 30%/70% interface, washed with RPMI, counted, and suspended in fluorescence-activated cell sorting buffer (0.1% bovine serum albumin in DPBS) cell receptors were blocked with 1% mouse serum and rat anti-mouse CD16/32 MAb for 20 min on ice prior to staining with fluorescein isothiocyanate. 3, 5, and 7 p.i. were homogenized using a neural tissue dissociation kit. brain homogenates were prepared for 30/70% Percoll gradients. CNS cells were blocked with mouse serum and anti-CD16/32 MAb. microglia and astrocytes were sorted based on their CD45int CD11b+ phenotypes. for Cxcl9, 5\u2032-TGCACGATGCTCCTGCA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AGGTCTTTTTGTAGTGG-3\u2032 (reverse); for Cxcl10, 5\u2032-GACGGTCCTATGTCTCTCATT-3\u2032 (reverse); for the viral nucleocapsid gene, 5\u2032-GCCAAATAATCGCGCTAGAA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-AAGTGCATCATCATCATACA-3\u2032 RNA levels were determined using the 7500 fast real-time PCR system. gene expression in total tissue mRNA or glial populations was normalized to the respective GAPDH mRNA expression in each mRNA preparation. nonspecific Ab binding was blocked using 1% bovine serum albumin, 10% goat or donkey serum, and goat anti-mouse IgG(H+L) sections were stained with rabbit anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-GFAP) and rat anti-mouse CD3 MAb (eBioscience) images were acquired using a Leica TCS-SP5II upright confocal/multiphoton microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) all images were analyzed using Fiji version 1.0. quantification of viral N protein staining areas and the relative proportion of colocalization with GFAP or IBA1 reactivity were calculated per field of interest. BMDM was collected from femurs and tibiae of 8- to 10-week-old mice. cells were lysed directly in 800 l TRIzol (Invitrogen) and stored at 70\u00b0C for RNA isolation.
