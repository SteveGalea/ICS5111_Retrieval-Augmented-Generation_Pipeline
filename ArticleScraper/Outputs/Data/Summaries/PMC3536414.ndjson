{"summary": "the SGs regulate mRNA metabolism by blocking the translation of housekeeping genes. these responses help the cells survive under stress conditions (1, 2). Several families of viruses influence the formation of SGs in infected cells (5\u201320) RNA binds and sequesters TIA1-related protein (TIAR) in order to reduce virus-induced apoptosis mediated by TIAR (21) and (ii) the interaction of TIA1/TIAR with the 3\u2032-terminal stem-loop of west Nile virus (WNV) suppresses the formation of SGs and processing bodies (PBs) to favor virus replication (6). in VSV-infected cells, the viral replication proteins (N, P, and L) and nascently synthesized viral RNAs have been seen to be colocalized to \u201cgranular structures\u201d or \u201cinclusions\u201d in the cytoplasm. granules or inclusions have been suggested to be the sites of viral mRNA synthesis (27, 28) monolayer cultures of HeLa (ATCC catalog no. CCL2), Huh7, MCF-7, and HEK293 cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 8% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and the antibiotics penicillin (100 U/ml), kanamycin (20 U/ml), and streptomycin (20 U/ml) stocks of wt VSV were prepared as described earlier (27, 31). VSVG virus and VSV NCs (RNPs) were prepared as described earlier (23, 31). titers were determined by plaque assays on BHK-21 or HeLa cells. conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (A4416), horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit anti-goat IgG (A4174) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. PCR products were digested with KpnI and EcoRI. TIA1a isoform TIA1-EcoRI Rev ATATGAATTCTCACTGGGTTTTTCATACCCTGCC TIAR-KpnI. small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting these genes were transfected at a final concentration of 10 nM. a nontargeting (NT) siRNA (invitrogen) was used as a control siRNA. western blotting (WB) and quantification of the protein bands were performed as described previously (23). the following antibodies were used: anti-M, anti-actin, anti-actin, anti-TIA1 and anti-HA. 88-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG, 1:1,000 for Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG, and 1:2,000 for Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG. images were obtained with an Olympus FV500/IX81 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. Sodium arsenite (SA), nocodazole (Noc), cytochalasin D (CytoD), actinomycin D (ActD), 5-bromouridine 5\u2032-triphosphate sodium salt (BrUTP), cycloheximide (CHX) and a protease inhibitor cocktail were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. a 35S-labeled Met-Cys mixture for protein labeling was obtained from Perkin TIAR (goat polyclonal; Sc-1751), eIF3 (mouse monoclonal; Sc-137214), and eIF4AII (mouse monoclonal; sc-137148) were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. a rabbit polyclonal antibody against DCP1a (ab47811) was purchased from Abcam. the PCR products were digested with KpnI and EcoRI. the resulting constructs express the inserted genes with an HA epitope. expression of the proteins can be driven by either a cytomegalovirus promoter or a T7 promoter located upstream of the coding sequences. the transfection mixture was replaced with DMEM containing 8% FBS and PKS. the cells were incubated further for 40 to 48 h to allow knockdown of the gene. a nontargeting (NT) siRNA was used as a control siRNA. dilutions of secondary antibodies were 1:300 to 1:500 for anti-VSV N and anti-VSV L, 1:300 for anti-VSV P, 1:100 for anti-TIA1, anti-TIAR, and anti-eIF3, 1:3,000 for anti-HA, and 1:500 for anti-tubulin and anti-actin. images were obtained with an Olympus FV500/IX81 inverted laser scanning confocal microscope. RESULTS Cellular TIA1 downregulates VSV growth. cellular PCBP2 is a component of SGs. TIA1 and TIAR are well-known SG markers. TIA1 protein levels were determined by WB with an anti-TIA1 polyclonal antibody at 72 hpt. titers in the culture supernatants at the indicated hours postinfection were determined by a plaque assay. TIA1 protein levels were determined by WB with an anti-TIA1 polyclonal antibody. titers were determined at 12 hpi, and endogenous TIA1 levels in the cells were determined by WB. TIAR has no significant effect on VSV growth. viral growth kinetics analysis revealed that VSV growth was dampened at least 5-fold in TIA1-knockout MEFs, compared to that in wt MEFs. this result was unexpected given the previous report (10) and our studies with transient depletion of TIA1 by siRNA. TIA1 exerts its effect on VSV growth at the level of viral gene expression and/or genome replication. the level of viral M protein in NC-transfected cells treated with siRNA specific for TIA1 was approximately 3-fold higher than that in NC-transfected cells treated with NT siRNA. VSV at an MOI of 0.01 for 12 h (lanes 1 and 2) or with VSVG at an MOI of 0.5 for 8 h (lanes 3 and 4) or supertransfected for 6 h with viral NC prepared from VSV (lanes 5 and 6). cell lysates corresponding to equal amounts of total proteins were analyzed by WB with anti-TIA1 and anti-M antibodies. we infected cells with VSV and performed an IF assay using antibodies to detect endogenous TIA1 at different times postinfection. TIA1 was detected readily in the cytoplasm at 3 h postinfection (hpi) by 7 hpi, the majority of TIA1 was seen in the cytoplasmic granular structures (Fig. 3A, bottom row) secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 594-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG for TIA1 (red) and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG for VSV N (green) nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. PCBP2 colocalizes with VSV-induced SG-like structures. the cells were subjected to IF with antibodies against BrdU to detect newly synthesized RNA (green) and TIA1 (red) secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG for TIA1 (red) and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG for VSV L protein (green) levels of cellular and viral protein synthesis and of P-eIF2 were determined from the results shown in panel A. the rate of cellular protein synthesis was determined by quantification of the L, G, N, P, and M bands. the total viral protein level at 0 hpi was set at 100%. IF staining of VSV-infected cells showed that HA-PCBP2 colocalizes with endogenous TIA1 as well as with the viral P protein in the SG-like structures. TIA1 plays a key role in induction of SG formation and translational shutoff by replacing eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet. IF staining of TIA1 and the viral L protein or the BrUTP-labeled viral RNA showed that TIA1 colocalized with the viral L protein and the newly synthesized viral RNA. the TIAR protein was also found to colocalize with VSV N, P, L, and RNA in the same pattern as that observed for TIA1. these results suggest that VSV replication and ongoing protein synthesis are required for the generation and maintenance of SG- HeLa cells were infected with untreated (VSV Control) or UV-treated (UV-VSV) VSV at an MOI of 1 for 7 h. cells were processed for IF to detect the VSV N (green) and TIA1 (red) proteins. the secondary antibodies were the same as those described for Fig. 3A. IF was performed at 5 and 7 hpi for VSV N and TIA1 proteins. nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. the secondary antibodies used were the same as those described for Fig. 3A. transfection of N mRNA-specific siRNAs into cells inhibits VSV infection by >99% (34). no formation of TIA1-containing SG-like structures was detected at 5 hpi. at 7 hpi, a very small number of cells expressed low levels of the viral N protein. these structures could be readily detected in infected cells transfected with a nontargeting siRNA. reduced number of SG-like structures containing TIA1 could be detected readily. reduced number of SG-like structures could be a result of reduced and/or delayed growth of VSV in the presence of noc. formation of VSV-induced SG-like structures does not require a microfilament network. antibodies were used to detect VSV N (green) and TIA1 (red) secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor 594-labeled donkey anti-goat IgG for TIA1 (red) and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG for VSV N, tubulin, or actin (green) e or microfilament network used IF microscopy to look for the presence of the cellular eIF3 and eIF4A proteins in the SG-like structures. a significant proportion of the eIF3 subunit did not colocalize with TIA1 or VSV P protein in these virus-induced SG-like structures. similar results were also obtained with eIF4A in VSV-infected cells. at IgG for TIA1 (red), Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG for eIF3 (green) and Alexa Fluor 647-labeled donkey anti-rabbit IgG for VSV P (purple) SG-like structures containing TIA1/PCBP2 are not canonical. canonical SGs (indicated by the authentic marker eIF3) formed at the same level in VSV-infected cells as in mock-infected cells at various time points postinfection. SGs induced by heat shock, as visualized by eIF3 marker, also were not affected by VSV infection. the levels of phosphorylated eIF2 in infected cells increased steadily until 5 hpi. the percentage of cells exhibiting SG-like structures increased steadily with time after virus infection. cellular protein synthesis was inhibited with time after VSV infection, while viral protein synthesis levels increased. cellular PCBP2 inhibits VSV infection at the level of viral gene expression. recent studies have demonstrated that PCBP2 is a component of SGs. TIA1 and TIAR are well-known SG markers (1, 2). TIA1-depleted cells treated with NT siRNA or TIA1 siRNA at 10 nM for 68 to 72 h were infected with VSV at an MOI of 0.01. Statistical significance was determined for virus titers at 12 and 16 hpi. titers were determined at 12 hpi, and endogenous TIA1 levels in the cells were determined by WB. TIAR has no significant effect on VSV growth. a previous study (10) reported enhanced growth (up to 6-fold) of VSV in TIA1/mEFs. depletion of TIA1 from wt MEFs resulted in enhanced VSV growth. ectopic expression of HA-TIA1 in TIA1/mEFs resulted in significant inhibition of VSV growth. TIA1 exerts its effect on VSV growth at the level of viral gene expression. transfection of viral nucleocapsids (NCs) into cells bypasses virus entry steps. level of viral M protein in NC-transfected cells treated with siRNA specific for TIA1 was approximately 3-fold higher than that in NC-transfected cells treated with NT siRNA. TIA1 depletion results in a 3-fold increase in viral gene expression. the conditions of virus infection were the same as those described for panel A, lanes 1 and 2. the results show that silencing of TIA1 protein led to increased levels of both VSV mRNA (Fig. 2B) and antigenomic RNA (Fig. 2C) TIA1 was detected readily in the cytoplasm at 3 h postinfection (hpi) by 7 hpi, the majority of TIA1 was seen in the cytoplasmic granular structures. the formation of these granules was readily detected as early as 3 hpi. nuclei stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. PCBP2 colocalizes with VSV-induced SG-like structures. coverslips were processed with anti-HA antibodies at 7 hpi. nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. VSV N protein colocalizes with SG-like structures containing TIAR protein. experimental conditions were the same as those described for panel A. the rate of viral protein synthesis was determined by quantification of the L, G, N, P, and M bands. the total viral protein level at 0 hpi was set at 100%. the percentage of infected cells containing SG-like structures was determined by random examination of 150 cells from each experiment. in mock-infected cells, both HA-PCBP2 and TIA1 were detected mostly in the nucleus, where they partially colocalized. TIA1 plays a key role in the induction of SG formation and translational shutoff by replacing eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet in the canonical preinitiation complex. TIA1 colocalized with viral L protein and newly synthesized viral RNA. the TIAR protein was also found to colocalize with VSV N, P, L, and RNA. these results suggest that VSV infection induces SG-like structures. VSV replication and ongoing protein synthesis are required for the generation and maintenance of SG-like structures. nuclei stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. TIA1 was immunostained in red, and nuclei stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. SGs induced by SA disrupted by protein synthesis inhibitor CHX. nuclei were stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. a translational inhibitor of protein synthesis was used in VSV-infected cells. we investigated whether viral protein synthesis is required for the maintenance of the SG-like structures in infected cells. 1-containing SG-like structures detected at 5 hpi. at 7 hpi, a very small number of cells expressed low levels of the viral N protein. these structures could be readily detected in infected cells transfected with a nontargeting siRNA at 5 or 7 hpi. reduced number of SG-like structures could be a result of reduced growth of VSV in the presence of noc. formation of SG-like structures is not dependent on a cellular microtubule or microfilament network. cells were treated with DMSO (vehicle control) or Noc for 2 h before mock infection (A) or infection with VSV at an MOI of 1 (B) TIA1 and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled donkey anti-mouse IgG for VSV N, tubulin, or actin (green) cells were treated for 2 h with cytochalasin D (CytoD) to inhibit the polymerization of actin before VSV infection. the reduced levels of SG-like structures can be ascribed to the documented negative effects of actin depolymerization on VSV infection. eIF4A proteins, two authentic markers of SGs, are distinct from the SG-like structures induced by VSV. a majority of the cellular TIA1 protein colocalized with the eIF3 subunit in the SG-like structures in the cytoplasm. similar results were also obtained with eIF4A in VSV-infected cells. heLa cells were either mock infected or infected with VSV at an MOI of 1, and at 7 hpi, cells were further treated with SA for 30 min to induce SGs. the secondary antibodies used here were Alexa Fluor 594-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG for eIF3 and Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-rabbit IgG for VSV P. Figure 6B shows the formation of SGs induced by SA treatment of VSV-infected cells at 7 hpi. SGs induced by heat shock, as visualized by the eIF3 marker, also were not affected by VSV infection. further, we examined the formation of cellular processing bodies (PBs) 2 in infected cells increased steadily until 5 hpi and remained at same level thereafter. cellular protein synthesis was inhibited with time after virus infection. viral protein synthesis levels increased simultaneously with eIF2. PCBP2 is a component of cellular SGs and PBs (2, 22); PCBP2 colocalizes with TIA1 in SGs (22); and several viruses have been shown to induce and/or interfere with the formation of TIA1/TIAR-containing SGs. TIA1 but not TIAR, inhibits VSV growth at the level of viral gene expression and/or replication. induction of SG-like structures in infected cells required viral replication and protein synthesis. this interpretation is consistent with the delayed appearance (3 hpi) of the structures in infected cells. many viruses have been shown to either induce (11, 13, 15, 17, 18, 50) or suppress (6, 8, 12, 14, 51) SG formation in infected cells. hepatitis C virus-induced SGs contain TIA1, G3BP, and other RNA-binding proteins and restrict the replication of the wt vaccinia virus. however, whether the SGs, AVGs, or pseudo-SGs are generated by the host cells in response to virus infection remains an open question at this time. TIA1 protein blocks translation of cellular mRNA in canonical SGs. eIF2 phosphorylation and the protein kinase R play any role in the formation of the SG-like structures. it will be of interest to explore whether PKR or other eIF2-specific kinases play any role in the induction of the SG-like structures. wt and TIA1-knockout MEFs may reveal important clues for a better understanding of the role of TIA1 in VSV infection. TIA1 inhibits VSV replication and colocalizes with PCBP2."}
