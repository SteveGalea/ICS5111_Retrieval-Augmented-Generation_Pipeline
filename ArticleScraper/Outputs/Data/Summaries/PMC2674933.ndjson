{"summary": "mitochondrial antiviral signaling adaptor, MAVS (IPS-1, VISA or Cardif) is critical for host defenses to viral infection by inducing type-1 interferons. MAVS-induced cell death requires mitochondrial localization, is caspase dependent, and displays hallmarks of apoptosis. in vitro and in vivo experiments have revealed a critical role for MAVS and its mitochondrial localization in the activation of host antiviral responses. the localization of MAVS to the mitochondria suggests other putative mitochondrial functions for MAVS, prominent among these is apoptosis. a protein linked with the autoinflammatory Crohn's disease has been reported to increase caspase-9-induced apoptosis when overexpressed. a third CARD-containing NLR, Nlrc4 (Ipaf), mediates cell death through a caspase-1 dependent fashion [12], [13], [14]. the presence of a CARD-like domain coupled with its mitochondrial localization suggests a putative role for MAVS in both immune and cell death hepatitis A virus encodes for the 3ABC protein, which localizes to the mitochondria and inhibits MAVS signaling via proteolytic cleavage. there are no reports of viral proteins targeting MAVS for inhibition of virus-induced cell death responses. adenoviruses and baculoviruses which are defective in anti-apoptotic genes are compromised in producing progeny viruses. several pro-apoptotic proteins have been found in SARS-CoV genome. the early pathogenesis of SARS is poorly understood and how apoptosis contributes to the initial pathological changes is largely unknown. in this report, we describe a novel function of MAVS in mediating virus-induced apoptosis. -induced cell death is potent as 10 ng of MAVS plasmid was sufficient to decrease cell viability by 40%. cells were harvested for trypan blue exclusion cell counting 48 h post-transfection. -caspase inhibitor resulted in a complete reversal of MAVS-induced cell death. it is known that caspase-dependent apoptosis can cause poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. hek293T cells were transfected with two different doses of MAVS plasmid. hek293T cells were transfected with 1 g or 3 g of MAVS-expressing plasmids. hek293T cells were harvested 24 h or 48 h post-transfection. TEM analysis was carried out 48 hours post-transfection. sendai virus expressing GFP (rSeV-GFP) infected mice with rSeV-GFP. rSeV-GFP is a known inducer of apoptosis in primary fibroblasts. MAVS wild type and knockout MEFs were infected with rSeV-GFP at a MOI of 0.5. cells were stained with Hoechst blue and Propidium Iodide (PI) truncation of the MAVS proline rich region (MAVSProl) had little effect on apoptosis. all the MAVS truncation mutants were expressed well. inability of these constructs to induce apoptosis is not due to ineffective protein expression. truncation mutants are not dispensable for the pro-apoptotic function of MAVS. 1 g of wildtype MAVS and its three mutants depicted in (A) were introduced in HEK293T cells; apoptosis was assessed by flow cytometry 48 h post-transfection. cation mutant of RIG-I [41], full-length MAVS [1], or MDA-5 in conjunction with its ligand poly(IC) [42] zare all potent IFN-I inducers. only full length MAVS triggered apoptosis as quantified by Annexin V and 7-AAD staining. transient expression of MAVS in HEK293T cells induced apoptosis even in the presence of the NF-B super-repressor. there are 14 subtypes of type-1 IFNs, and a plethora of other secreted soluble factors can be induced by MAVS expression. in this experiment, only the lower chamber was transfected with MAVS, but were exposed to the same cytokine milieu. HEK293T cells were plated in 96-well plate and endogenous IRF3 expression was reduced by transfecting a pool of four siRNA into the cells. the same siRNA was introduced into 5105 cells plated in a 6-well plate and an immunoblot was used to verify the efficiency of siRNA 48 h post-transfection. s from both C57BL/6 wild type and IFNAR/ mice were infected with rSeV-GFP. cells were stained with Hoechst and PI 48 h post-infection. the non-degradable form of IB was co-expressed with different doses of MAVS. the other half of the cells described in (C) were lysed in RIPA buffer. the other half of the cells described in (C) were subjected to western blot analyses. the SARS-CoV non-structural protein 15 inhibits MAVS-induced apoptosis. 12 of the SARS-CoV proteins were co-expressed with MAVS. NSP15 is the only one that exhibited a potent inhibitory effect on apoptosis. cell death was measured by an adenylate kinase activity assay. cells at 48 hours post-transfection with MAVS plasmid were plated in 96-well plate. this result was confirmed by measurements of cell viability via XTT assay. cells were harvested for trypan blue exclusion cell counting. apoptosis can cause poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. it is known that caspase-dependent apoptosis can cause poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. a kinetic analysis shows that MAVS expression reached a peak at 24 h post-transfection. the late onset of apoptosis does not appear to be due to lack of MAVS expression. there are several molecular steps that have to occur before MAVS could cause caspase-3 and caspase-9 activation, leading to apoptosis. rSeV-GFP is a known inducer of apoptosis. rSeV-GFP infected wildtype MEFs maintain a spindle-like fibroblastic morphology. rSeV-GFP infected wildtype MEFs maintain a spindle-like morphology. MAVS mediates seV-induced apoptosis in primary fibroblasts. cells were infected with rSeV-GFP at a MOI of 0.5. cells were stained with Hoechst blue and Propidium Iodide. truncation of the MAVS proline rich region (MAVSProl) had little effect on apoptosis. inability of these constructs to induce apoptosis is not due to ineffective protein expression. inability of these constructs to induce apoptosis is not due to ineffective protein expression. MAVS contains a N-terminal CARD-like domain, a C-terminal transmembrane domain (TM) and a central proline-rich region. the TM and CARD-like domains are not dispensable for the pro-apoptotic function of MAVS. a helicase domain truncation mutant of RIG-I [41], full-length MAVS [1], or MDA-5 in conjunction with its ligand poly(IC) [42] zare all potent IFN-I inducers. only full-length MAVS triggered apoptosis. super-repressor form of IB is known potent inhibitor of NF-B activation. transient expression of MAVS in HEK293T cells induced apoptosis even in the presence of the NF-B super-repressor. we performed a transwell assay designed to definitively answer if MAVS-induced cell death was intrinsic to the host cell. HEK293T cells were plated in 96-well plate and endogenous IRF3 expression was reduced by transfecting a pool of four siRNA into the cells. the same siRNA was introduced into 5105 cells plated in a 6-well plate and an immunoblot was used to verify the efficiency of siRNA 48 h post-transfection. seV-induced apoptosis is IFN-I-independent. MEFs from both C57BL/6 wild type and IFNAR/ mice were infected with rSeV-GFP. cell viability loss was not restored. the plot represents two separate experiments. the percentages of Annexin V positive cells were averaged for quantification. the other half of the cells described in (C) were lysed in RIPA buffer and subjected to western blot analyses. NSP15 inhibited apoptosis as measured by Annexin V and 7-AAD staining. the others showed little effect on cell viability. the inhibitory effect of NSP15 displays dose-dependency. cytokines include the comprehensive host immune response designed to defend against viral infection. this is accompanied by a reciprocal activation of programmed cell death in infected host cells. apoptosis has been suggested to play a protective role at the organismal level in preventing the virus from completing its replication and producing infectious progeny viruses. cytokines bind to surface receptors leading to the activation of the Jak-Stat signal transduction pathway. type-1 IFN induction of apoptotic responses can be mediated by a multitude of ISGs. the role of proteins on IFN axis in virus-induced host cell apoptosis has been implicated. in the IFN-I induction pathway mediated by endogenous RIG-I like helicases, IRF3 lies downstream of MAVS. exogenous expression of MAVS can lead to the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of IRF3. it is possible that the reported pro-apoptotic effects of the constitutively active form of IRF3 might be independent of its IFN-I-inducing function. hepatitis A virus (HAV) employs a cysteine protease 3ABC to abrogate IFN-I production by targeting MAVS. this protein disrupts IFN-I production through the targeted cleavage of the MAVS transmembrane region. this protein completely abolished its pro-apoptotic effects. a new mechanism by which mitochondria serves as a bona fide intracellular sentinel for antiviral and apoptotic responses. the finding that MAVS mediates virus-induced apoptosis posits a new mechanism by which mitochondria serves as a bona fide intracellular sentinel for antiviral and apoptotic responses. cells and Plasmids HEK293T cells, MAVS+/+, MAVS/, IFNAR/ mouse embryonic fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM media supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. the mammalian expression plasmids of NS3/4A, wild type MAVS and truncation mutants were provided by Dr. Zhijian Chen.
