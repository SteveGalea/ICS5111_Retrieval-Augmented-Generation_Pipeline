{"summary": "PEDV spreads primarily through fecal-oral contact (1, 2). it destroys the lining of piglets\u2019 intestines, making them incapable of digesting and deriving nutrition from milk and feed. the virus causes diarrhea, vomiting, and death from dehydration and starvation. /2013 and NPL-PEDV/2013/P10 contain 28,038 and 28,025 nucleotides (nt) the top three BLAST hits were against U.S. isolates. the spike gene contains six nonsynonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms. the native spike protein of NPL-PEDV/2013 has 63 trypsin and 2 chymotrypsin cleavage sites at 100% efficiency. NPL-PEDV/2013/P10 has lost one trypsin cleavage site."}
