{"summary": "networks where nodes of the network represent hosts and edges between nodes represent contacts across which pathogens may be transmitted are now regularly used to model host interactions. a promising development in this field is the use of statistical techniques which aim to model a contact network based on data relating to the passage of a pathogen through a population. the answer to this question will determine whether these new statistical techniques can be extended to estimate the level of clustering in a network. the answer to this question will determine whether these new statistical techniques can be extended to estimate the level of clustering in a network. de 6 to node 1 to node 3 and back to node 6 is a cycle but there is no cycle that includes node 4. clustering is a measure of propensity of cycles of length 3 (triangles) to form. edges (2,1) and (2,5) do not comprise part of a triangle as (1,5) does not exist. in a graph with no cycles, there may be multiple paths leading from i to k that do not include j, so giving a different probability that k becomes infected and a different expected time to infection for k. newman [14] and Britton et al. [15] show that for sufficiently high levels of transmissibility an increase in clustering reduces the epidemic threshold. clustering induced by household structure in a population has an effect on probability of an outbreak and the expected size of any outbreak. the probability of an outbreak is shown to be monotonically decreasing with clustering coefficient and the expected outbreak size also decreases with clustering. ing at lower levels has little effect on the probability of an outbreak. but as the clustering coefficient reaches about 0.45, the chance of an outbreak reduces significantly. some more recent papers seek to distinguish the effects of clustering from confounding factors such as assortativity and degree sequence. epidemics use simulations to try to distinguish the effects of clustering and assortativity but look at directed graphs. they find that clustering has little effect on epidemic behaviour. the theory is tested using simulations on various empirical networks from a wide range of domains and synthetic networks simulated from theoretical models. the results of the simulations, presented in Section 3, show that there is likely little to no signal of clustering in a contact network to be found in a single realisation of an epidemic process over that network. we conclude that it is unlikely that clustering parameters can be inferred solely from epidemiological data that relates to the transmission tree. we simulate power-law using a Reed-Molloy type algorithm [28]. the degree of each node, di, i = 1,..., N, is sampled from the appropriate distribution. when all stubs have been paired, loops are removed and multiple edges between the same nodes are collapsed to single edges. a0 = 5,... constraints = degreedist, burnin=5e+5) and y_lo = simulate (y gwesp(0.2, fixed=T), theta0 = 5,... constraints = degreedist, burnin=5e+5) We measure clustering in the resulting networks using the clustering coefficient [12], defined as follows. let Ni = j|Yij = 1 be the neighbourhood of vertex i and di = |Ni| be the degree of we condition on the outbreak infecting at least 20 nodes. the parameter values are set at = 0.1, kE = kI = 1 and E = I = 3. summarising Epidemic Data A transmission tree encodes all information about the outbreak it describes. leaf nodes are defined by the time and label pair (ti, ui) the internal nodes are associated with the triple (ti, ui, vi) being the time of the event, ti, the label ui of the exposed individual and vi that is the transmitter or \u201cparent\u201d of the infection. the branches of the tree are times between infection, transmission and recovery events for a particular vertex. this tree has one \u201ccherry\u201d, formed by the leaves labelled (5.2, 4) and (6.2, 5), out of a possible maximum of two cherries. we summarise the transmission tree using the following statistics: mean branch length between internal nodes. the mean branch length of those branches adjacent to a leaf node corresponds to the mean time between secondary infections for each individual. a power-law network is defined as having a power-law degree distribution, that is, for nodes i = 1,..., N, P (di = k) k for some > 0. power-law networks are commonly used to model social interactions. we simulate power-law using a Reed-Molloy type algorithm [28]. the degree of each node, di, i = 1,..., N, is sampled from the appropriate distribution. when all stubs have been paired, loops are removed and multiple edges between the same nodes are collapsed to single edges. constraints = degreedist, burnin=5e+5) and y_lo = simulate (y gwesp(0.2, fixed=T), theta0 = 5,... constraints = degreedist, burnin=5e+5) We measure clustering in the resulting networks using the clustering coefficient [12], defined as follows. if di > 1, the local clustering coefficient is Ci = 2ni/di(di \u2013 1). a gamma distributed waiting time with mean kII and variance k I I 2. Once a node is recovered, it plays no further part in the spread of the infection. for each pair, Yhi and Ylo, we start the infection from the same node. we condition on the outbreak infecting at least 20 nodes. leaf nodes are defined by the time and label pair (ti, ui, vi) the internal nodes are associated with the triple (ti, ui, vi) being the time of the event, ti, the label ui of the exposed individual and vi that is the transmitter or \u201cparent\u201d of the infection. this tree has one \u201ccherry\u201d, formed by the leaves labelled (5.2, 4) and (6.2, 5), out of a possible maximum of two cherries. we summarise the transmission tree using the following statistics: mean branch length between internal nodes. the mean branch length of those branches adjacent to a leaf node corresponds to the mean time between secondary infections for each individual. simulated networks with high and low clustering for a given degree distribution are easily distinguished from one another. simulated networks with high and low clustering contain no triangles, so the clustering coefficient for each of these networks is zero. the variances of the measured statistics, however, are sufficiently large due to stochastic effects in the model. only the number of cherries differing in the mean. figures 6 and 7 show the corresponding distributions for networks with power-law degree distributions. figure 6. Empirical distributions of summary statistics of transmission trees from epidemics on power-law networks. the results suggest that the behaviour of an epidemic on a random network with a given degree sequence is relatively unaffected by clustering in the network. some effect is seen, but it is small relative to the random variation we see between epidemics on similarly clustered networks. the levels of clustering achieved in the simulations reported here are not so high as those considered in the some of the simulations and theoretical work described in Section 1. there is little known about the levels of clustering found in real contact networks [31] and no evidence to suggest very extreme values of clustering are achieved for a given degree sequence. the noise that characterises such data sets makes it difficult to accurately reconstruct the transmission tree. this extra uncertainty would likely make any inference of a clustering parameter very difficult in the absence of other information."}
