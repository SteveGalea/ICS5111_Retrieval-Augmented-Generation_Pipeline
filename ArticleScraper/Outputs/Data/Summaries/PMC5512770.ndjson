{"summary": "MERS-CoV was first reported in Saudi Arabia in 2012. it has infected at least 1,888 individuals worldwide including 670 deaths. the virus once had significant spread in south Korea in 2015. a transgenic mouse model expressing MERS-CoV's receptor hDPP4 (hDPP4-Tg) shows global expression of hDPP4 including lung, trachea, spleen, kidney, and brain. the hDPP4-expressing Tg mice exhibit constant weight loss and death. alum is also effective to trigger MERS-CoV RBD protein to elicit sufficient antibody responses and neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV. compared with MF59, alum is used in >80% of licensed human vaccines with a long-term history. sera were collected at 10 and 40 days post-last vaccination. hDPP4-Tg mice were immunized with S377-588-Fc protein. boosted once at 1-, 2-, 3-, or 4-week intervals, respectively, or not boosted. IgG antibodies elicited at an interval of 4 weeks were the highest and significantly higher than those induced at intervals of 1 and 2 weeks. induction of the highest antibody responses can be achieved by immunization consisting of two doses of S377-588-Fc protein spaced four weeks apart. significant differences were observed between 1-dose or 2-dose-1-week and 2-dose-2-, 3- or 4-week, respectively. significant differences were also observed between 2-dose-3- or 3-week and 2-dose-4-week, respectively. two doses of S377-588-Fc spaced 4 weeks apart induced the highest neutralizing antibodies among the groups receiving one or two doses at intervals of 1, 2, or 3 weeks. this method is safe, rapid and efficient, and does not require live MERS-CoV or BSL-3 laboratories. antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that resulted in complete inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in at least 50% of the wells (NT50) the data are presented as mean SD from five mice in each group. significant differences were revealed between 1-dose and 2-dose-2-, 3- or 4-week, or 2-dose-1-week and 2-dose-3- or 4-week, respectively. two doses of S377-588-Fc spaced 4 weeks apart protected hDPP4-Tg mice from lethal challenge of MERS-CoV. two doses of S377-588-Fc boosted at a 4-week interval induced the highest neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection. the antibody titers are presented as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. the antibody titers are presented as the endpoint dilutions that remain positively detectable. hDPP4-Tg mice were first immunized with S377-588-Fc protein at optimal doses and interval. sera were collected at 10 and 40 days post-last vaccination to detect IgG antibodies. sera of mice immunized with S377-588-Fc were collected at 10 (A, C, E) and 40 (B, D, F) days post-last immunization and detected for MERS-CoV S1-specific IgG (A, B), IgG1 (C, D), and IgG2a (E, F) antibodies by ELISA. significant differences were observed between 1-dose and four 2-dose groups. significant differences were observed between 1-dose and the four 2-dose groups, respectively (*); between 2-dose-1-week and 2-dose-2-, 3- or 4-week, respectively (#); or between 2-dose-3-week and 2-dose-4-week (\u2022) significant differences were also observed between 2-dose-3-week and 2-dose-4-week (\u2022) two doses of S377-588-Fc spaced 4 weeks apart induced the highest neutralizing antibodies among the groups receiving one or two doses at intervals of 1, 2, or 3 weeks. this method is safe, rapid and efficient and does not require live MERS-CoV or BSL-3 laboratories. live neutralizing antibody titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of sera that resulted in complete inhibition of virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in at least 50% of the wells. significant differences were revealed between 1-dose and 2-dose-2-, 3- or 4-week, or 2-dose-1-week and 2-dose-3- or 4-week, respectively. significant differences were also revealed among groups receiving 2 doses spaced 3 weeks apart and groups receiving one or two doses at intervals of 1 or 2 weeks respectively. two doses of S377-588-Fc spaced 4 weeks apart protected hDPP4-Tg mice from lethal challenge of MERS-CoV. control, boosted once at a 4-week interval, challenged with MERS-CoV at 12 weeks post-boost. control and those injected with PBS and challenged with MERS-CoV (Ac) were included as controls. vaccination is one of the most effective strategies to prevent and treat virus infection. a recombinant protein containing residues 377\u2013588 of MERS-CoV RBD fused with human IgG-Fc induced potent neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV infection. a key step in vaccine development involves the identification of an ideal immunogen dosage and immunization interval. a ization interval of 4 weeks is widely used in clinical trials of vaccines to prevent diseases. individuals with measles usually receive an extra administration of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine, separated by at least 28 days. we have previously demonstrated the immunogenicity and/or protection of MERS-CoV RBD protein in mice and/or rabbits. both Th1 and Th2 cells promote humoral immune responses to vaccines. in mice, Th1 cells secret IL-2, INF- and TNF- cytokines to produce IgG2a antibody, thus mediating cellular immunity. Th2 cells secret IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 cytokines to facilitate B cells to produce IgG1 antibody. unization IgG 1,540 2,834 51,511 160,123 239,579 IgG1 14,468 29,971 79,198 413,559 500,498 IgG2a 100 153 3,111 5,556 28,959 PsV-neutralizing Ab* 35 38 421 1,022 1,358 Live virus-neutralizing Ab 20 20 133 640 1,493 Serum samples collected 40 days after the last immunization IgG 7, neutralizing antibody titers (NT50) at 1:40 or 1:119 can be protective (unpublished data),26 here we found that two mice at NT50 1:141 did not survive from lethal MERS-CoV challenge. this could be partly due to different doses of infectious viruses used for the challenge. this study emphasizes the importance of immunogen doses and vaccination intervals in determining an appropriate immunization schedule. the identified optimal immunization schedule (2-dose-4-week interval) may also be applied to vaccination against other enveloped viruses with class I glycoproteins. female BALB/c mice at 6\u20138 weeks and male and female hDPP4-Tg mice at 4 months were used. mice were s.c. immunized with S377-588-Fc (10 g/100 l/mouse) in the presence of MF59 adjuvant. ELISA ELISA was performed to evaluate MERS-CoV S1-specific antibodies in mouse sera. 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome (pNL4-3.luc.RE) supernatants containing MERS pseudovirus were harvested 72 h post-transfection and used for single-cycle infection. mice were immunized with the lethal dose of MERS-CoV (EMC-2012 strain, 104 TCID50) 12 weeks post-boost, and investigated for 3 weeks to detect pathological changes and survival. the correlation between neutralizing antibodies and mouse survival was recorded. mice were immunized with S377-588-Fc (10 g/100 l/mouse) in the presence of MF59 adjuvant.
