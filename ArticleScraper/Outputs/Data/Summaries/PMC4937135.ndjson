{"summary": "9 serum and 26 plasma samples were collected from domestic ferrets between august 1st, 2012 and febr 4th, 2014. one fecal sample from a ferret in our animal facility was used to amplify the N gene of the FRCoV Yamaguchi-1 strain. two fragments of the Yamaguchi-1 strain were electrophoresed on a 0.8% gel. cloned into BamHI and XhoI sites of expression plasmid pGEX-6P-1 vector. expression plasmid pGEX-6P-1 vector was expressed as fusion proteins. supernatants were mixed with glutathione sepharose 4B beads. they were then centrifuged at 20,630 g for 30 min. supernatants were harvested as purified recombinant proteins. DS, 0.002% bromophenol blue and 10% 2-mercaptoethanol were boiled for 3 min. samples were electrophoresed by SDS-PAGE and stained with CBB. 100 l of horseradish peroxidase Substrate (BIO-RAD) was added to each well. after three washes with PBS-T, membranes were incubated with 2 ml of ferret serum or plasma diluted to 1:1,000 in T-TBS containing 1% gelatin (BIO-RAD) the membranes were washed three times with T-TBS and then three times with TBS. the reaction was visualized using a 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride (Wako) significant differences were statistically analyzed using Chi-square and Fisher\u2019s exact probability tests. RESULTS Antigenic comparison of GST fused recombinant proteins, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374) was determined. ELISA using two recombinant proteins, GST-N (1-179) and GST-N (180-374) seven sera and 15 plasma samples collected from domestic ferrets in Japan were diluted to 1:500. peroxidase-conjugated anti-ferret immunoglobulin at 1:2,000 was used as the secondary antibody. ELISA using GST-N (1-179) was carried out with 1:100 dilutions of nine sera and 26 plasma samples from domestic ferrets in 12 animal hospitals in five prefectures in Japan. the results showed 31 of the 35 (89%) ferrets were seropositive for FRCoV infection. more ferret serum samples recognized GST-N (1-179) than GST-N (180-374). more ferret serum samples recognized GST-N (1-179) than GST-N (180-374). ELISA using GST-N (1-179) will be useful for serological surveys. a new ELISA system using the recombinant N protein of FRCoV, GST-N (1-179), was established. this FRCoV infected with ferret no.22 should be analyzed closely."}
