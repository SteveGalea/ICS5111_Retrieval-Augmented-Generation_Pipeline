{"summary": "the increase in lipid deposition might be explained by elevated adipogenesis of marrow mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) however, it remains unclear whether there is a close association between elevated adipogenesis and steroid-associated ON development. marrow fat cells number and area were much larger in either ON+ or MON group as compared with either ON- or SON group. the adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs and PPAR2 expression in either ON+ or MON group were elevated significantly as compared with either ON- or SON group. in vitro studies also showed elevated adipogenic differentiation ability of MSCs after steroid treatment. the relationship between the adipogenesis of marrow MSCs and steroid-associated ON remains unclear. rabbits were placed and fixed in supine position after anesthesia. contrast-enhanced dynamic MR pulse sequence used previously established ultrafast T1-weighted gradient-echo sequences. bolus of dimeglumin gadopentetate (Magnevist; Schering, Berlin, Germany) was rapidly administered via the right ear vein, immediately followed by normal saline flush. signal intensity (SI) was then measured in the regions of interest (ROIs) over the target site beneath the joint space. the cells were cultured in an incubator at 37\u00b0C, 5% humidified CO2 for two weeks. the cells were harvested for the following evaluations. the adipogenic differentiation ability was induced in adipogenic medium for 10 days. PCR was performed in a DNA thermal circler (Biometra, Germany) the PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel. the ratio of PPAR2 to GAPDH was calculated for quantitative comparison. cells size and fat cells area would be measured with imaging process software Image-Pro Plus 5.1. fat cells density = marrow fat cells number in selected field/(selected field area \u2013 trabecular bone area); fat cells diameter = the total diameter of fat cells in selected field. rabbits injected with 10 g/kg body weight of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) 24 hours later, three injections of 20 mg/kg body weight of methyprednisolone (MPS) were given intramuscularly at a time interval of 24 hours. rabbits were kept in cage and had free access to food and water ad libitum. the baseline value of the SI in a TIC was calculated as the mean SI value in the first three images. the maximum SI (SImax) was defined as the peak enhancement value at a given time interval of 90s after contrast injection. the perfusion parameter was calculated according to the following equation: \"Maximum enhancement\" the cells were fixed with 10% neutral buffered formalin followed by incubating with 60% propylene glycol. after staining, the cells were rinsed with distilled water. 1 ml of isopropyl alcohol was added to the stained dish. the bone marrow was harvested from proximal femur for MSCs culture based on our established protocol. the cells were cultured in an incubator at 37\u00b0C, 5% humidified CO2 for two weeks. the cells were harvested for the following evaluations: MSCs adipogenesis evaluation. RNA was isolated with TRIzol reagent (Gibco, USA) cDNA was then prepared from the total RNA extracted. 1 ml of each cDNA was subjected to PCR reaction using rabbit PPAR2 primers (PPAR2 forward 5'CCAGGGGCCGAGAGA3' and reverse 5'AAGCCAGGGATGTTTTTG 3') the first field was located at the approximate center of the femoral head at the ligamentum teres and the remaining four fields were located at the both sides of the first field. the mean of the five sections from each animal was taken as the value for that rabbit. ney test using SPSS software 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) results ON incidence and extension No rabbits died during the entire experiment period. 15 rabbits were found ON+ (60%) and 10 were ON- (40%). the time-signal Intensity curve showed a significant decrease in enhancement slope in ON+ group as compared with ON-group at week 2. fat cells density was 265 23/mm2 in ON+ group, increased by 47.2% as compared with ON- group (180 19/mm2). the number of adipocytes in ON+ group was 270% more as compared with ON- group, 120% more in MON group as compared with SON group. the optical density results showed 210% more triglycerides formation in ON+ group as compared with ON- group, and 80% more in MON group as compared with SON group. of the 25 rabbits, 15 were found ON+ (60%) and 10 were ON- (40%). of the 15 rabbits, 6 rabbits had only one lesion and were classified to SON group. 9 rabbits had more than one lesion and were classified into MON group. time-signal Intensity curve showed a significant decrease in enhancement slope in ON+ group as compared with ON- group at week 2. fat cells density The fat cells density was 265 23/mm2 in ON+ group, increased by 47.2% as compared with ON- group (180 19/mm2). fat cells size The mean fat cells diameter was 40.3 4.1 mm in ON+ group, and 45.8 5.3 mm in ON- group (p > 0.05). /mm2 in ON+ group increased by 47.2% as compared with ON- group. it was 289 28/mm2 in MON group, much larger as compared with SON group. fat cells diameter was 40.3 4.1 mm in ON+ group, and 45.8 5.3 mm in ON- group (p > 0.05). lycerides formation in ON+ group was 270% more as compared with ON- group, 120% more in MON group as compared with SON group. PPAR2 mRNA expression in ON+ group was 180% higher as compared with ON- group (p 0.05), and 85% higher in MON group as compared with SON group (p 0.05). PPAR2 gene expression in ON+ group was 180% higher as compared with ON- group (p 0.05), and 85% higher in MON group as compared with SON group (p 0.05). PPAR2 expression in ON+ group was 180% higher as compared with ON- group (p 0.05), and 85% higher in MON group as compared with SON group (p 0.05). marrow lipid deposition would affect blood perfusion function even to ischemia. a close association between elevated adipogenesis of MSCs and steroid-associated osteonecrosis extension. marrow MSCs showed higher adipogenic differentiation ability. ogenesis of MSCs, including colony-forming unit of adipocytes, was not compared between before and after steroid administration. marrow aspiration before steroid administration might affect ON development in rabbit model."}
