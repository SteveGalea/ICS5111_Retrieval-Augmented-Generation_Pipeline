{"summary": "ahin Kaya zdemir, Jiangang Zhu, Xu Yang, Bo Peng, Huzeyfe Yilmaz, Lina He, Faraz Monifi, Steven He Huang, Gui Lu Long, and Lan Yang. loss compensation in optical microresonators has been done using rare-earth ions. al enzyme of the transsulfuration pathway regulates flux through the pathway to yield compounds, such as cysteine, glutathione, taurine, and H2S. the structure unravels the molecular mechanism of human CBS activation by AdoMet. current knowledge will allow for modeling of numerous pathogenic mutations causing inherited homocystinuria. yeast cells orient in gradients of sex pheromone detecting differences in the amount of ligand-receptor complex. PRESS requires that events downstream of the receptor be transient and faster than the time required for the receptor to reach equilibrium binding. mevalonate pathway enzyme HMGS-1 regulates metabolism during aging. HMGS-1 is regulated by posttranslational ubiquitination and age-dependent sumoylation. HMGS-1 regulates metabolism during aging. nup98 promotes antiviral gene expression to restrict RNA viral infection in drosophila debasis Panda, Pau Pascual-Garcia, Margaret Dunagin, Matthew Tudor, Kaycie C. Hopkins, Jie Xu, Beth Gold, Arjun Raj, Maya Capelson, and Sara Cherry. innate immune system is a highly conserved defense that induces gene expression programs to restrict microbial infections. coronaviruses possess the largest known RNA virus genomes. the RNA polymerase (nsp12) needs to associate with nsp7 and nsp8. this complex associates with nsp14, the proofreading subunit required to safeguard coronavirus replication fidelity. connexin hemichannels contribute to spontaneous electrical activity in the human fetal cortex Anna R. Moore, wen-Liang Zhou, Carissa L. Sirois, Glenn S. Belinsky, Nada Zecevic, and Srdjan D. Antic Young neurons require occasional bursts of action-potential firing to maintain intracellular processes. during early cortical development these synaptic inputs are largely absent. epidermal growth factor, an extracellular signaling molecule, induces phosphorylation by extracellular signal-regulated (ERK/MAP) kinases at the same site on REST. the phosphorylation facilitates elimination of REST during the transition to neurons."}
