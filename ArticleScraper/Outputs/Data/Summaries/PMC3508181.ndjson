{"summary": "mice were seronegative for ectromelia virus, murine rotavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, MPV, minute virus of mice, murine norovirus, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus, sendai virus, and mycoplasma pulmonis. mice were housed in individually ventilated cages (140 cages per rack) under positive pressure. wk were inoculated orally with 300 infectious doses of MPV1d. blood was collected from all mice at the end of the study by cardiocentesis. sera were tested for antibodies to MPV by using an indirect immunofluorescent assay and MPV1d-infected L3 cells. 28 nave Swiss Webster female mice were housed in 14 cages (2 mice per cage) at 6, 13, 27, and 41 d after inoculation, feces were collected from all MPV-inoculated mice in each cage for PCR analysis. gloves and cage exteriors were not decontaminated between cage changes. inel mice were exposed for 1 wk to potential fomites generated from the 14 cages housing the MPV-infected mice. a single sentinel mouse was placed into each of the 14 cages with clean autoclaved bedding. a single sentinel mouse was placed into each of the 14 cages with clean autoclaved bedding. female Swiss Webster mice (n +112) inoculated with MPV1d were housed 4 mice per cage (28 cages total) at 6 d after inoculation, feces were collected from each cage of MPV-infected mice. blood was collected by cardiocentesis after euthanasia by carbon dioxide overdose. mice were exposed to fomites for 1 wk and were bled at 3 wk after exposure. mice were seronegative for ectromelia virus, murine rotavirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, mouse hepatitis virus, MPV, minute virus of mice, murine norovirus, pneumonia virus of mice. all animal care and experimental procedures were approved by the Yale IACUC. mice were inoculated orally with 300 infectious doses of MPV1d. blood was collected from all mice at the end of the study by cardiocentesis. Swiss Webster mice inoculated with MPV1d were housed 4 mice per cage (14 cages total) in individually ventilated cages containing corncob bedding, nesting material, and a new polycarbonate shelter. at 6, 13, 27, and 41 d after inoculation, feces were collected from all mice in each cage for PCR analysis. sentinel mice were exposed to the nesting material used to sample the floor surface for 1 wk. transmission by water valves, used cages, and soiled bedding. at 1 wpi, gloves were changed and routine decontamination of cage exteriors was initiated. one Swiss Webster mouse inoculated with MPV1d 1 wk previously was added to each of 7 cages housing a breeding pair of 9-wk-old Swiss Webster mice at 1 to 2 d prepartum. feces were collected from each cage of MPV-infected mice for PCR analysis. sentinel mice were exposed to fomites for 1 wk and were bled at 3 wk after exposure to the washed cage. the remaining 14 soiled cages were disassembled at 1 wpi. none of the mice exposed to nesting pads that had been affixed to the bottom of shoe covers during husbandry procedures at 1, 2, 4, and 6 wpi became MPV seropositive. transmission of MPV by contaminants on floor surface is worn routinely in mouse rooms in which MPV-infected mice are housed. the level of MPV DNA shed in the feces of index mice dropped substantially between 1 and 2 wpi and was undetectable in the feces of all mice at 6 wpi. no difference in the level of MPV DNA shed was detected at 1, 2, 4 and 6 wpi between male and female mice. most sentinels exposed to nesting material removed from cages at 1, 2, and 3 wk after introduction of the index mouse seroconverted to MPV. none of the sentinels exposed to nesting material removed from cages at 4, 5, and 6 wk after introduction of the index mouse (second litters present in the cage) seroconverted to MPV. all (56 of 56) mice in cages housing MPV-inoculated mice were seropositive for MPV 3 wk after a 1-wk exposure to components from cages that had housed MPV-inoculated mice for 1 wk. transmission of MPV by contaminants on floor surface. at 3 wk after exposure, all mice exposed to soiled bedding or used cages were seropositive for MPV. only 21% of the mice exposed to the used water valves were seropositive for MPV. oculation Male mice Female mice 1 27,793 (12,534\u201349,265) 32,107 (12,508\u201366,931) 2 25.1 (24.9\u201325.8) 26.1 (24.6\u201326.8) 4 4.4 (2.1\u20136.7) 6 0 0 Transmission of MPV by used cage components and washed cages. the greatest risk for transmission of MPV was compared for sets of 14 mice exposed to soiled cage bottoms, used wire bars and filter tops, used shelters, or used food. the lack of transmission of MPV from nesting material affixed on shoe covers suggests that the floor of the floor of the cage. mouse room had scant, if any, MPV present on its surface. this is probably because the mice were housed in HEPA-inlet and -exhausted ventilated cage racks. this result could call into question the need to adjust cage or room pressure to control MPV spread. a significant decrease in the frequency of transmission was observed between 2 and 4 wpi, in concert with a substantial decrease in MPV DNA detected in feces of the index mice. the frequency of transmission by other cage components (shelters, cage bottom, wirebar, cage top, food, water valves) likely also decreases after 2 wpi. environmental sampling and PCR of nucleic acids from murine infectious agents is becoming a part of many quality assurance programs. the presence of nucleic acids does not always correlate with the presence of infectious particles. this situation is particularly true for environmentally unstable enveloped viruses, such as mouse hepatitis virus and rat coronavirus. washing of cages was shown to decrease the risk of transmission of MPV from cages that had housed mice acutely infected with MPV from 100% to 0%. in the current study, the caging and associated components were contaminated with a level of MPV that would be equal or higher than that from populations of mice of mixed backgrounds. the water temperature in the cage washer used in these studies was 82 \u00b0C. only 14 cages were used in this study, but washed cages could still pose a low risk for MPV transmission. energy and environmental concerns have led some laboratory animal facilities to use of lower water temperatures or to omit detergents during cage washing."}
