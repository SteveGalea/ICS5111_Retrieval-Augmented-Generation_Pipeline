{"summary": "researchers analyzed the characteristics of a 38 month cohort of Campylobacter strains isolated from stool specimens in a new Brunswick regional laboratory. we also present the susceptibility data of a subset of C jejuni isolates to ciprofloxacin (cip) and erythromycin (ery) most cases of C jejuni resistant to cip in our laboratory are acquired outside Canada. most cases of C jejuni resistant to cip in our area are acquired outside canada. 1026 (66.0%) of specimens showed no growth on STEC CM. clinically insignificant growth (colony colour other than brown or mauve) was detected in 353 (22.7%) specimens. 47.6% identified as an organism other than E. coli. a total of 811 clinical stool samples were collected from patients with suspected gastroenteritis. community samples (n=473) were sent for routine bacterial culture. all samples were then tested using the Luminex xTAG\u00ae GPP and Seeplex\u00ae Diarrhea-V ACE assays. algorithms containing both EIA and PCR offer reduced cost. PCR only used for discrepant results. RESULTS: Mean age was 61.9 years (SD 21.2), 120 (60.0%) were female. 399 clinical and reference isolates belonging to the genera Campylobacter, Arcobacter, Helicobacter, Wolinella, and Bacteriodes were subjected to conventional short or full biochemical plus molecular testing (PCR-RFLP, species-specific PCR, 16S sequencing) MALDI-TOF analysis was used as the initial identification screen followed by selective confirmation conventional testing. identification by MALDI-TOF analysis is recommended for use in a clinical or reference laboratory to supplement or substitute conventional species-level identification methods. one hundred eight urine samples were inoculated simultaneously onto blood agar (BA), MacConkey agar (MAC) and Chromagar and incubated for 18\u201324 hours aerobically at 35C. direct inoculation is a reliable method except for cephalothin and piperacillin. cefazolin can replace cephalothin as a predictor for oral cephalosporins for uncomplicated UTI. 30,000 Canadians develop sepsis each year with an associated mortality rate of 30%. identification obtained from the SMI was reported, this resulted in a reduction in time to initiation of more appropriate antibiotics in a patient population with blood stream infections. further studies are required to see whether this impacts patient outcomes. AST by the BMD method suggested that strains were susceptible to most antibiotics, including metronidazole. pathogenicity remains unknown, but clinicians should be aware of possibility of Eisenbergiella tayi as a cause of bacteremia. 48/64 clinical Ma isolates possessed an intact erm(41) with the T28 polymorphism and were resistant. 16 isolates had the C28 polymorphism, resulting in a non-functional erm(41) of these, 9 were susceptible, 4 were intermediate, and 2 were resistant (discordant), and 1 isolate also had the rrl mutation and was resistant. data was linked with the MB TB registry (n=1116) and descriptive statistics were used to explore the demographic and geographic characteristics of clusters. cluster 3 is consistently the most common TB type in the province each year (18.3\u201353.4%) positive cultures from mycobacterium Growth Indicator Tubes or Lowenstein-Jensen pyruvate agar were used. the ICT specificity was 94%, and the sensitivity was 94%. the first discrepant isolate was M. bovis BCG. BACKGROUND: high incidence of severe invasive infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type a (Hia) has been reported from Northwestern Ontario. most cases struck young First Nations children or adults with significant underlying medical conditions. strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae were serotyped using the Quellung method. the 10 most common serotypes from respiratory isolates were 3, 11A, 19A, 22F, 19F, 19F, 23A, non-typeable, 6C, 35B and 23B. 8% for penicillin (PEN, oral penicillin V breakpoints), 84/88% for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) and 99/100% for ceftriaxone (nonmeningitis breakpoints). Isolates from blood demonstrated 4.4% MDR, primarily to CLR, CLD, DOX, PEN and PEN in serotype 19A. -lactamase mediated ampicillin resistance was most commonly observed among all serotypes and non-typeable isolates. resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was observed with rates as high as 20.8% of non-typeable (99/477) and 13.6% of serotype b (9/66) isolates. physicians wrote 87.37% of prescriptions, dentists 11.25%, nurses-practitioners 0.59%, pharmacists 0.38%, podiatrists 0.10%, midwives 0.04%, naturopaths 0.10% and others 0.17%. from 1996\u20132013, overall antibiotic use declined from 18.3 to 16.0 DID. dental surgeons increased their rate 62.2% from 0.99 to 1.59 DID. catheter-days per patient-days was compared monthly to two control general medical units before (1 month) and following (3 months) implementation. active surveillance for catheter re-insertion within 48-hours was performed with chart reviews to assess for re-insertion due to inappropriate urinary catheter removal. the health PEI Urinary Tract Infection Empiric Treatment Guidelines were distributed to all physicians, nurse practitioners, and pharmacists in Prince Edward Island on may 24, 2013. nitrofurantoin is recommended as the first-line option for early cystitis in females (if no contraindication for its use) and a twice daily dosing formulation (MacroBID\u00ae) is suggested over four times daily dosing formulations to improve patient adherence. new guidelines appear to have a positive and lasting impact on the prescribing behaviours of PEI prescribers. BACKGROUND: data on neonatal invasive candidiasis presenting in the first week of life are limited to case reports. a 59-year-old man underwent resection of a craniopharyngioma complicated by a CSF leak necessitating lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt insertion. postoperatively he developed persistent fever and a reduced level of consciousness. after 7 days of therapy his level of consciousness worsened with increased CSF leucocytosis. over 85% of cases received IV amphotericin alone or in combination with IT amphotericin, flucytosine and/or fluconazole. no cases reported use of IT amphotericin with or without IT amphotericin. three MRSA strains belonged to MLST ST-239 (spa t-030) with 98.8% homology. this is the first case of linezolid-resistant MRSA in china. 105,934 samples were tested using Siemens\u2019 Centaur Syphilis EIA assay. a total of 105,934 samples were tested using the Siemens\u2019 Centaur Syphilis EIA assay. potential false positive patients demonstrated TPE index values ranging from >1.0 to 11.17. false positive rates for the RPR screening test have been reported to be up to 2.0% or greater. the number of participants shedding PCR-detected influenza A and/or B viruses was highest on day 1 post-LAIV administration for both influenza A and B viruses. overall, 40 (70%) participants with CF and 11 (58%) healthy participants shed either PCR-detected influenza A and/or B viruses throughout follow-up. over 300 confirmed cases of chikungunya were identified in 2014. this marked a 10 to 200 fold increase in the average yearly number of cases previously observed in Canadian travellers. most cases with travel histories were reported from travellers to the Caribbean where the virus recently emerged. however, significant numbers of cases were also identified in travellers to the Asia \u2013 Pacific region where significant outbreaks are also occurring. the lower limit of detection (LoD) of each method was determined by testing 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA extracted from cultured EV-D68. five replicates of each dilution were shipped to participating sites. the estimated LoD for each assay was defined by Probit analysis using a probability of 95%. sixty-seven retrospective and 36 prospective respiratory samples were tested on all three assays. negative samples had to test negative by 2/3 assays, while inconclusive samples were defined as those with band signal intensity between 0\u2013100 on the RV15. discordant rates were 47% and 21% for positive and negative samples, respectively. of 79 SA tested from BA, CCT was pos in 61/61 mecA (18 weak-pos) but 0/4 mecC MRSA, and negative (neg) in 14/14 MSSA. of 77 SA tested from CA, CCT was pos in 44/55 mecA (22 weak-pos) but 0/6 mecC MRSA, and neg in 15/16 MSSA (1 weak-pos remnants), while Denka was pos in 55/55 mec 3 picked instead of touched colonies increased the overall CCT Sn for detecting mecA MRSA from 90.5% to 99.1%. widespread adoption of GBS screening and intrapartum prophylaxis has reduced the incidence of early-onset disease significantly. d to SBA and 97.7% for RQ subculture to CSB. CSB allowed easy visual discrimination between Enterococcus sp. and GBS. amplification was detected using a Genie\u00ae II (OptiGene, UK) for culture 30l of E-swab fluid was inoculated onto a 5% sheep blood agar plate and incubated anerobically for 24 hours at 35 \u00b0C. plates were examined and beta haemolytic colonies were identified using gram stain, catalase, and PathoDx latex grouping. discordant results were examined by repeating the culture from the original PCR assays are notoriously prone to false-positives (FP) due to 1) and 2) and false-negatives (FN) due to 3. the XNC SPA target correctly identified 156/156 SA. targets were detected in 0/10 mecC MRSA leading to an overall MRSA detection sensitivity (Sn) of 92.1% (95% CI: 85.9\u201395.8). amplification occurred for SCC alone in 11/13 rem-SA and 3/17 SA with no remnants. for mec alone in 1 rem-SA, and for mec alone in 1 rem-SA with no remnants. cefazolin susceptibilities of 129 urinary clinical isolates of E. coli, K. pneumonia and P. mirabilis in 2013 were compared using the new 2014 CLSI interpretation. it is generally acceptable to report cefazolin directly from Vitek 2 AST against the three species of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from urine cultures using the new 2014 CLSI interpretation. multiplex PCR assays to detect Shigella, Campylobacter, enterotoxigenic E. coli LT/ST toxin, Salmonella, and Cryptosporidium. results included height at 60 days, weight at 60 days, 60-day mortality, and recurrence of diarrhoea in the 60-day followup period. each patient\u2019s serum was first tested with the C6 B. burgdorferi (Lyme) ELISA. samples that produced positive or equivocal results on the C6 ELISA were then tested for IgG antibodies using a Western blot (B. burgdorferi US (IgG), Euroimmun, Luebeck, Germany) 89/111 (80.1%) of human staphylococci were CMRSA10, 82/89 (92.1%) of which were Spa type 008. 55/157 (35.0%) of dogs were colonized with coagulase-positive staphylococci. abs from 339 patients were vortexed in sterile saline. 50 L was applied to each medium. resistance mechanisms were elucidated using the CLSI ESBL disk test. two commercial media manufacturers have modified their respective formulations of chromogenic MRSA plates. each claim to offer more robust growth at reduced incubation times of 18 hrs. each claim to offer more robust growth at reduced incubation times. 350 samples identified 34 positives (10% positivity rate) through at least one positive plate. Sensitivity at 18hrs: MS:92%; DB: 94%; MS2 and DB2:97%. 86% of samples tested exactly the same by all methods. 10% tested antigen positive, toxin negative by the rapid test and antigen positive, toxin positive by the algorithmic method. 4% did not show some correlation and were sent out of province for additional investigation. DF had the poorest sensitivity at 38.5%, DFA at 57.6%, and conventional PCR at 81.3%. real-time PCR has the advantage of detecting T. pallidum down to a single spirochete. EV-D68 strains sequenced from all four patients in Alberta belong to lineage 2 based on VP1 phylogenetic analysis. the deletion at amino acid 141 in VP1 was absent and two deletion blocks were observed in the 5\u2019UTR. no changes were noted in the antigenic epitope regions of the BC and DE loops. 304 known clinical C. jejuni isolates across Alberta health zones from 2006 to 2009 were genotyped for the presence or absence of 40 target accessory genes. genome fingerprints for each isolate comprising genotyping results were used to determine genetic relatedness amongst strains. new clusters between sporadic isolates were discovered, suggesting identification of outbreak cases that were previously not detected due to the lack of evidence. core genome SNP phylogeny method for discrimination of highly clonal S. Heidelberg strains involved in different outbreaks. forty-six strains involved in 3 epidemiologically documented outbreaks in Quebec were subjected to whole genome sequencing and core genome SNP analysis. clinical gonococcal isolates from Halifax, Nova Scotia were submitted to the national microbiology laboratory for further characterization. Isolates were typed by Neisseria gonorrhoeae\u2013Multi-Antigen Sequence Typing (NG-MAST) sequence types were grouped if they differ by three base pairs or less in the DNA sequences of the por and tbpB genes. NG-MAST groups identified were associated with distinct demographics of patients and susceptibility profiles of isolated organisms depicting discrete sexual networks. phylogenetic classification is required for elucidating local epidemiology. incorporation of NG-MAST into routine surveillance activities could inform prevention and control programs. prs were developed to detect Lm with high-specificity and sensitivity from clinical, environmental and food isolates. non-listeriae strains were not detected based on exclusivity testing. results on all used real-time platforms demonstrated equivalent detection sensitivity. two alternative approaches to web-based engagement and interaction were developed and tested in 2 focus groups interviews. SIC clinics have been established in 13 hospitals across Canada staffed by infectious diseases specialists and allergists. as of January 2015, 122 of 142 (86%) patients referred met the inclusion criteria. most were referred for prior AEFI (78/89, 88%). most were referred for large local reactions, 21 (24%) for allergic-like reactions. units selected the method of feedback from the eMonitoring system. hand hygiene adherence was measured with eMonitoring as a hand hygiene compliance index (HHCI), representing the number of dispenses of handrub divided by the number of expected hygiene opportunities per patient hour. students who used the album found the album was useful for review. but student engagement was limited to less than 1/3 of the class. this year we recreated the album and tried to promote student engagement. community pop-up clinic is staffed by 6 individuals, including an infectious disease specialist. clinic is staffed by 6 individuals, including an infectious disease specialist. follow-up is offered at the established clinic, as a walk-in or by appointment. XCR v1 detected 100% of KPC (95% CI: 96\u2013100), NDM (95% CI: 93\u2013100), OXA48-specific (95% CI: 73\u2013100), OXA244 (95% CI: 73\u2013100), IMP1, NDM, OXA48-like and VIM genes. only 187 CPO were expected to be detected by XCR. 0/14 OXA48-like genes were detected (0/9 OXA181 and 0/5 OXA232) XCR was negative for SME, NMC, OXA24 and all non-CPO and the NDM-revertant. overall sensitivity (Sp) for claimed genes was 92% (95% CI: 88\u201396)/98% (95% CI: 86->99.9) all samples were also cultured using the CHROMagarTM CD fluorogenic chromogenic agar (CHROM) colonies suspicious for CD were identified using MALDI-TOF (Bruker) 63 and 85 samples met the definition of a CD positive and CD negative sample respectively. current guidelines recommend that all pregnant women be screened for vaginal/rectal colonization at 35\u201337 weeks of gestation. rapid commercial molecular tests are too expensive to be used in GBS screening. the cost for LAMP is about Cdn$3.00 per test. illumigene\u00ae GBS assay uses loop-mediated amplification technology to detect GBS from enrichments broths. 45 of 204 samples were positive for GBS in TH broth by culture. illumigene\u00ae performed equally well from both broths. phenotypic Carba-NP (CNP) claims to rapidly distinguish all CPO from non-CPO. RCN, CBL and RSC were tested and interpreted as per manufacturer. mRCS used 0.8% saline (pH 8.0) in lieu of extraction buffer. 77% OXA CPO went undetected and 12.9% of non-CPO were erroneously pos. no assay detected all CPO despite modifications or consideration of various pos colour endpoints. a review of antibiotic resistant organisms (ARO) surveillance in canada revealed a gap outside the hospital setting. the process allowed reporting for 14 organisms of interest, detailed analysis of trends by age-group, gender and region within the province. the process appears sustainable through twice-yearly data extraction. in-depth analysis can provide professionals with new tools to combat AROs. A. fumigatus isolates were recovered from clinic outpatients (68%) and Medicine inpatients (19%) from sputa and bronchoscopy specimens. 5% of A. niger had non-WT MICs to VORI, ITRA, or POSA. there was very little evidence of microbiological resistance to echinocandins across the species. Isolates were from patients on W 39.5%, ER 23.3%, ICU 18.8%, and C 18.4%. most common pathogens were: E. coli 19.6%, S. aureus 19.5%, P. aeruginosa 11.0%, K. pneumoniae 5.8%, S. aureus 5.0%, and S. pneumoniae 4.9%. uginosa rates are lowest with colistin, gentamicin, and piperacillintazobactam. no resistance was observed in MRSA with vancomycin, line-zolid, or daptomycin. CANWARD is an ongoing national surveillance study that assesses pathogens causing infections in patients admitted to Canadian hospitals. this data highlights the importance of continuing to monitor trends to ensure the detection of new and re-emerging threats associated with antimicrobial resistance. Candida species isolated from bloodstream infections were collected from 12 participating medical centres during the 2014 study period. c. glabrata is a common cause of candidemia and echinocandin resistance of 5% in Canada is associated with glucan synthase mutations. antibiotic resistance continues to be a global threat and is fuelled by their inappropriate use for primarily viral respiratory tract infections. 1.2 mg of DCBA dissolved in 5 ml of artificial saliva exhibited a 2.43 \u2013 2.68 log10 reduction in viral titre at 1 minute. a placebo lozenge without AMC and DCBA exhibited a 0 \u2013 0.43 log10 reduction in viral titre at 1 minute. a breakpoint of 12 mm for TemR was chosen as it correlated with 100% (95% CI: 88\u2013100) Sp as 34/34 non-CPO had zones >11 mm (range: 12\u201333 mm) a breakpoint of 12 mm for TemR was chosen as it correlated with 100% (95% CI: 88\u2013100) Sp. 100% non-CPO had Tem zones of 9 mm (no zone) this test was highly specific for CPO as 100% non-CPO had Tem zones >11 mm. phenotypic detection of CPO when class B CPO were poorly expressed. genetic polymorphism of CYP2C19 modulates enzyme activity and significantly different plasma concentrations are observed despite identical dosing schedules. individuals may be categorized as ultra rapid metabolizers (CYP2C19*1/*17 CYP2C19 *17/ *17); extensive metabolizers (EM) (CYP2C19*1/*1) and poor metabolizers (PM) (CYP2c19*2/*2, CYP2C19*2/ cytotoxicity profile of the Neutraplex nanosystem was determined using different cell models. cellular uptake was evaluated by confocal microscopy. effect on inflammatory response was evaluated using in vitro neutrophil apoptosis. wide range of specimens were processed on TLA using a customized automation platform. Consecutive specimens were processed in real-time simultaneously and blinded on TLA and manually in off-line incubators. identification of pathogens was achieved using a combination of mass spectrometry, Vitek2, chromogenic media. a retrospective cohort study examined consecutive patients with confirmed SAB and prior MRSA screening swabs. of the 799 patients, 95 (12%) patients had a positive and 704 (88%) had a negative prior MRSA screening swab. small studies suggest clinicians inconsistently document symptoms in the medical chart for patients suspected of having urinary tract infection (UTI) small studies suggest clinicians inconsistently document symptoms in the medical chart. 152 patients were treated: 101 (66%) treatment-naive and 51 (34%) treatment-experienced; 21% were cirrhotic, 61% non-CC IL28B genotype, 71% HCV RNA 800K IU/mL. the only currently available all-oral regimen requires 24-week treatment that includes ribavirin (RBV) the most frequent adverse events (all grades) were headache (20%), fatigue (18%), nausea (12%), and diarrhea (9%). this all-oral combination of DCV+SOF in HCV GT 3 infection achieved SVR4 rates of 91% and 86% in treatment-naive and -experienced patients. patients were 58% male and 26% IL28B genotype; 73% infected with GT 1a and 27% with GT 1b. most common adverse events (in >10% of patients) were headache, fatigue, diarrhea, and nausea. patients were randomly assigned to receive a fixed-dose combination (FDC) of DCV 30 mg, ASV 200 mg, and \u2018325 75 mg, with blinded RBV or placebo, twice-daily for 12 weeks. SVR12 rates in the treatment-naive and experienced cohorts were evaluated separately as key efficacy outcomes. Candida glabrata (CG) is the second leading cause of candidemia in north America. reports of invasive infections caused by echinocandin-resistant CG are increasing. echinocandin resistance in Candida is uncommon but most often associated with CG and recent echinocandin exposure. glucan synthase mutations confer high MICs, likely due to the haploid CG chromosome. a total of 885 ticks at different developmental stages were retrieved from 483 mice. 51 mice were confirmed to have antibodies against B. burgdorferi. plasma endotoxin levels were measured using a commercial ELISA. DNA was extracted from plasma and PCR was used to detect presence of bacteria. no difference was observed in plasma endotoxin concentration of patients compared to healthy controls. 8 specimens were indeterminate and 2 were negative by INNO-LIA. 96% of positive specimens were confirmed positive by either HCV antigen test or immunoblot. positive results for hepatitis C antigen are consistent with active infection. MLST and PFGE were used to analyse molecular genetics of Hia. three isolates belonged to serotype a, sequence type-23, shared identical PFGE profiles. many attributes of Hia bear resemblance to the disease it causes. joint fluid culture was positive in 68 samples (16.7% of total) tissue culture was positive in 15 samples (26.7 % of total) this is lower than would be expected from the literature. prolonged incubation of joint fluid/tissue of up to 2 weeks increases the culture yield. no significant variation in sodium, potassium, chloride, and creatinine was observed with time points extending up to four hours. for urea, ionized calcium, and bicarbonate, significant differences were observed but the concentration differences were no more than 5% from the initial time point. the proportion of MSSA with triclosan MICs 1 mg/L rose significantly from 0.2% to 9.1% over the last 20 years from sterile and non-sterile sites. the introduction of antiviral protease inhibitors (PIs) has proven to be effective treatment for Hepatitis C. clinical trials indicate a high rate of baseline mutations in the NS3/4A protease known to confer resistance to these agents. no current incidence rates for Ontario patients exist. Candida albicans is an opportunistic pathogen associated with human infection frequently treated with azoles. the aim of this study was to determine whether the novel iron chelator, DIBI, could inhibit growth of C. albicans in vitro. C. albicans was suppressed at lower concentrations of 0.25 g/mL FLC and 4 g/mL DIBI. growth curves showed that C. albicans continued to be suppressed up to 72\u201396 h when the azole was combined with DIBI. 19% (3/16) had severe sepsis and 6% (1/16) had septic shock. ongoing post-implementation review will evaluate patient outcomes including mortality, morbidity, length of stay and process measures. ability to recognize sepsis early is essential to improving outcomes. BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance is an increasingly recognized priority for prevention and control of infectious diseases. it is recognized that the control of AMR requires a variety of actions and players from the local to the global level. public health is looked to as a key player in an overall strategy. the proposed HPTR would set out a risk-based licensing scheme for facilities conducting controlled activities with human pathogens and toxins. a biological safety officer who meets certain knowledge requirements set out in the proposed regulations would be designated before a licence can be issued by the Agency. the agency will also use other policy tools to strengthen pathogen accountability and oversight in Canada. 128 patients positive for both HBsAg and Anti-HBe were randomly selected and PC/BCP mutations were determined using line probe assay. the patients\u2019 chart review was performed to find a potential link with their race/ethnicity, HBV genotype, HBV viral load, liver enzymes, ultrasound, and biopsy results up to ten years prior to the study. median age was 36 months (2 weeks to 59 months); 7 were 1 year of age. male to female ratio was 1.3:1. multilobar infiltrates were seen in 13 of 70 patients who had chest radiographs. participants were asked multiple choice questions to evaluate the use of RVT. a single center retrospective analysis of RVT among all infants under 6 weeks evaluated in the ED for sepsis from 2009 to 2013. HIV-positive individuals were asked to complete a self-administered questionnaire. the effects of smoking on respiratory symptoms and diseases were reported as estimates of odds ratio. smoking had a statistically significant effect on respiratory symptoms and diseases. the study is limited by self-reporting of symptoms and disease states. caregivers and visitors may be potential vectors in transmission of healthcare-associated infections. policies and protocols for this population are less studied and lack standardization. despite consensus guidelines, this age group are over-diagnosed for suspected UTI. evidence shows no mortality benefit, and significant risk of harm, in treating asymptomatic bacteriuria with antibiotics. isoniazid is the most common first-line anti-tuberculosis drug to which isolates of Mycobacterium tuberculosis are resistant. the aim of this retrospective case control study is to determine whether isoniazid(INH)-resistant strains are as transmissible/virulent as INH-susceptible stains. hA mutations in 4 strains (3 high-level, 1 low-level) and no mutation or aphC-only mutation in 15 strains (10 high-level, 5 low-level) contacts of cases were significantly less likely to be secondary cases (1 of 2203 vs. 20 of 4331), P0.05. 15 or 20% of CPE showed meropenem-susceptible MICs within the susceptible range based on current CLSI (1 g/mL) or EUCAST (2 g/mL) breakpoint tables. the majority of meropenem-susceptible CPE were observed among E. coli isolates; however, this phenomenon was not exclusive to any one genus. the fellowship is comprised of multidisciplinary collaboration with the adult/pediatric pharmacy teams and Infection Prevention and Control teams at tertiary care sites in the city. the trainee is also involved in the local and provincial AS committees and other projects including review of local clinical guidelines. successful completion of the fellowship will be acknowledged with a certificate awarded by the PGME office. 78% of dogs were colonized with S. pseudintermedius including 7% with MRSP. resistance to fluoroquinolones, rifampin, nitrofurantoin, vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin or quinupristin + dalfopristin was confirmed. retrospective cohort study examined consecutive SAB patients from 6 academic and community hospitals between 2007 and 2010. quality measures of management including echocardiogram, repeat blood culture, removal of infectious foci, and antibiotic therapy were compared between ID consultation and no ID consultation (NIDC) groups. 174 consecutive specimens from 6 LTC facilities were considered. 101 specimens from 101 residents were eligible. baseline ADL score was 11.9, with zero representing total independence. the study aimed to describe the molecular and epidemiological characteristics of heterogeneous vancomycin intermediate coagulase negative staphylococci (CLABSI) in a single tertiary-care NICU in Qu\u00e9bec. the most common species of hVICoNS causing CLABSI were Staphylococcus epidermidis (96.6%), S. warneri (2.3%), and S. capititis (1.1%) PFGE pattern E strains spanned from 2009\u20132014, pattern M strains spanned from 2010\u20132014 and pattern O strains spanned from 2011\u20132013. hVICoNS CLABSI may no longer be appropriate, with 40.9% of strains demonstrating resistance. RESULTS: 90 blood and 33 throat isolates were retrieved. of the blood isolates, 57 (63%) and 33 (37%) were Lancefield group G and C. Fifty (91%) had documented signs and symptoms of cystitis. urine C&S was sent from 45 (82%) patients, of which 33 (73%) samples were positive. choice of antibiotic was in accordance with guidelines for 46 (85%) patients. 154 of 310 identified stool samples had been kept (49.7%) eighteen samples were excluded (17 duplicates and one patient was never seen at the MCH) the average age of the entire cohort was 8.5 years (SD 6.2) ICD-9 codes were used to determine if cases had one event of croup, bronchiolitis, pneumonia, or mixed events. of all PIV 1\u20134 cases, pneumonia was the most common acute respiratory illness 33.5%, (403/1204) followed by bronchiolitis 19.5%, (301/1204). pneumonia cases 49.1%, (198/403) were most likely to be associated with PIV 3. ninety-five first-time CDIs occurred in SOT recipients over 2006\u20132013. liver recipients made up the largest proportion of infected patients. only 15.8% of patients received guideline-concordant therapy. 94 children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis (CF) and 19 healthy siblings, aged 2\u201319 years, recruited from 3 CF clinics across canada. prospective active surveillance for solicited and unsolicited adverse events was performed for 56 days post-LAIV administration. four participants (3.5%), all with CF, were hospitalized during the follow-up period; only 1 occurring on day 16 post-LAIV administration. the mechanisms of severe skin lesions induced by a predominant CA-MRSA strain USA300 remain unknown. we established a murine intradermal infection model capable of revealing new potential mechanisms contributing to development of severe skin lesions. USA300 induced smaller lesion sizes with less neutrophil infiltration in PAR1-KO than WT mice. similar lesion size but faster healing with decreased neutrophil infiltration was observed in PAR2-KO relative to WT mice. in 80% of hospitals, the participant was favourable to the implementation of a provincial QASP. foreseen problems were the lack of human, financial and information technology resources; comparisons between hospitals were viewed as both a methodological challenge and useful information. fecal calprotectin values were higher in CD-PCR+ samples (P0.001) as was the mean serum PCT (p 0.021) in those subjects. CPT was less specific with an AUC 0.8 (CI 0.67\u20130.92), sensitivity 87%, specificity 55%, at a HR-CPT of 135 mcg/g. intrathecal colistin therapy prompted a switch to intrathecal colistin. only one study reported side effects with intrathecal colistin. patients should be monitored for neurological side effects during therapy. anemia was present in 40% of patients prior to initiating Highly Active Anti-Retroviral Therapy (HAART) and 14% following effective therapy with a 26% net reduction. female sex, First Nations and M\u00e9tis ethnicity, and lack of HAART are significant risk factors for developing anemia. more aggressive strategies are required to investigate and manage anemia in patients with HIV. blood cultures were incubated in the Bactec 9240 system (Becton Dickinson) microorganisms were separated from blood cells and concentrated in a serum separator. organisms were recovered by sweeping the smudge plate and inoculated on a target slide. 278 patients met eligibility criteria and underwent chart review. 190 (68.3%) patients were female. 224 (80.6%) patients were given antimicrobial therapy. clinical features, outcomes of influenza infection and health care utilization for individuals 60 years and older with laboratory-confirmed influenza presenting to emergency departments in Ontario. of 1337 participants, 147 (11%) had flu (94 AH3N2, 12 AH1N1, 4 A (not subtype), 37 B) the most commonly reported symptoms were cough (93%), fatigue (92%), (84%) and weakness. ely framework to introduce resource stewardship at a national educational retreat for Infectious Diseases (ID) and Microbiology (M) residents from 11 Canadian universities participated in a modified Delphi panel. participants were asked to submit up to five practices that ID and M specialists should not routinely perform due to lack of proven benefit. the aim of this study is to determine the impact of a multimodal intervention to prevent and manage hospital-acquired C. difficile infection. the intervention included initiating a facility-wide C. difficile outbreak and utilizing an Incident Management Team to rapidly engage administrators and leaders. a multimodal intervention resulted in a significant, sustained decline in incident HA-CDI cases at a large, community hospital. a significant sustained decrease in antimicrobial utilization likely helped to maintain lower HA-CDI rates. 9%, 66.7% of ESBL-EC, AmpC-EC, and ESBL-KPN, respectively, were multidrug resistant. prevalence of ST131 clone was higher in ESBL-EC (56.9%) compared to AmpC-EC (31.7%; P0.001) coronary artery disease (25%), hypoxia (36%), tachycardia (11%) and hypotension (5%) were rare on presentation. the chest x-ray was interpreted as lobar consolidation in 68 (52%) polio vaccination programs have almost eliminated wild type poliovirus as a cause of acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), there is increased interest in AFP due to other enteroviruses (EV) such as EVD 68. study aims to characterize the nonpolio enteroviruses associated with acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), transverse myelitis (TM) or Guillain Barre syndrome (GBS) at least 50 different NPEV subtypes have been associated with AFP. EV 71, Echovirus 11, Echovirus 6, Echovirus 9 and Coxsackie B3 not commonly associated with AFP. EVD68, though a recent concern, has not historically been associated with AFP. this study tested 62 Candida and 10 Cryptococcus isolates. identification between phenotypic methods and MALDI-TOF was 100% to genus and 95.8% to species level. ITS later confirmed MALDI-TOF identification. additional cost for 534 Xpert MTB/RIF cartridges at $49.98 per test totaled $26,689. savings for bronchoscopies that were avoided were calculated using $1946 per uncomplicated bronchoscopy. ICU patients were less likely to be vaccinated (2; 5% vs. 14; 25%); however vaccination status was unknown in a large number (49; 51%) of patients. twenty-one suspected or proven nosocomial infections were treated. 243 children tested positive for rhinovirus, which was perennially detected. in 44% a viral co-infection, most commonly adenovirus was present. symptoms included cough, rhinor-rhea, shortness of breath and decreased appetite. retrospective study of PJI cases from 2005 to 2012 at a tertiary care centre was conducted to determine clinical management variability and outcomes of deep and organ space PJIs. of 8,505 hip and knee arthroplasty cases completed, 288 (3.4%) were subsequently diagnosed with a PJI and 63 (0.7%) cases were identified as deep or organ space PJI. urine samples from healthy individuals were used as controls. no strong and clinically significant correlation between biomarker levels and clinical data was highlighted. a positive trend in desmo-sine, an amino acid related to elastin degradation, was highlighted. the results indicate the potential of urine biomarkers in CF. further longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether fluctuation in biomarker levels correlate to clinical outcome. increase in PG compared to growth in non-fermentable sugars. large cell aggregates were seen in fermentable sugars and un-budded yeast in non-fermentable sugars. the effect is significantly increased in fermentable carbon sources. the introduction of MALDI-TOF and the subsequent return to SBA for urine specimens have produced an annual cost savings of $18,000. TEM analysis was employed to investigate the function of T4P in the C. difficile pathogenic program. core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and K-mer phylogenies are appropriate methodologies to detect and investigate outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7. core genome single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and K-mer phylogenies are appropriate methodologies to detect and investigate outbreaks of E. coli O157:H7. environmental strains of E. coli and other Proteobacteria have demonstrated heat resistance but there is no evidence of heat resistant STEC involved in clinical disease. heat resistance studies were performed on selected Alberta STEC isolates from 2006 to 2014. serotype O11:H30 showed greater heat resistance in 1% NaCl. 4% NaCl was favoured for serotypes ONT:H30 and O157:H3. positive isolates express additional protein bands at 35 kda and 110 kda. heat resistance associated with STEC plays an important role in food safety. most MRSA isolates in this study were susceptible to clindamycin and co-trimoxazole (90.5% and 95.2%), with only 29% susceptible to erythromycin. the majority of SSTIs were purulent infections and wounds. the transportation of specimens between sites contributes significantly to the overall turn-around time. as laboratory technical time decreases, the importance of this contribution increases. such delays should be considered when planning for a centralized laboratory system such as Optilab project. no peaks were seen in the 63 kDa range in any of the samples. it is speculated that this 56 kDa protein is a metabolite of C. difficile toxins. children with long-term central venous catheters develop cracks/breaks in their CVC. repair of broken CVC using aseptic technique has become more common. there is little published data on infectious complications after CVC repair. 8 of the repairs were successful (i.e. line retained >30 days) none of the patients had clinical deterioration within 30 days of line repair. prospective study would be more helpful in predicting short and long-term complications of CVC repair. the majority of individuals with AOI were smokers (53 [53%]), had dental insurance (70 [65%] and had seen a dentist in the past six months. thirty-nine [46%] reported current AOI as a recurrence. estimated cost saving of OPAT care compared with hospitalization for intravenous portion of antibiotics was $597,434. 97 interventions were done in 71 patients, mostly on Pip-Tazo 19%, Quinolones 17%, Cephalosporins 17%, Carbapenems 14%, Macrolides 8%, Antifungals 4%, Antivirals 3%. a total of 3292 DOT were observed among inpatients, and 306 electronic alerts were generated. the crimson channel in tube one was available for rhinovirus/enterovirus detection. the final design has two forward rhinovirus primers and one forward entero-virus primer with one reverse primer. Detection of enterovirus was tested with previously sequenced patient samples. of 647 rhinovirus/enterovirus positive samples tested in the specific assay, 183 (28.3%) were EV-D68 positive. CDC defines C. difficile infection (CDI) as the number one threat to public health. only 160 out of 376 consented patients had an evaluable stool sample for PCR testing. over 10% of tested patients were asymptomatic carriers of C. difficile (17patients tested positive for C. difficile) identifying carriers may offer alternatives to avoid iatrogenic CDI."}
