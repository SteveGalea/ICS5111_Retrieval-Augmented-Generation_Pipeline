{"summary": "primary PTEC and PBEC were isolated from the tracheae and bronchi of swine. both cultures showed the characteristic appearance of a pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium. the micrograph of the scanning electron microscopy illustrates the apical surface of PTEC and PBEC. the ciliated epithelial cells are the predominant cell type. scale bars, 20 m (A,B), 5 m (C) the images are shown in vertical (middle panels) or horizontal (others) sections. the pseudo-colour was applied in red (mucin 5AC) and green (MAA II) by using LAS AF Lite software for image comparison. mucin/mucus-producing cells (red) were found to have 2,6-linked but not 2,3-linked sialic acids. replication kinetics of human IAV We used two recombinant human IAV, R1 and R2, to analyze the course of infection in ALI cultures. the results were shown as means SEM of nine PBECs from three independent donors (swIAV) or six PBECs from two donors (R1 and R2) each sample was processed with two technical replicates. apical surface at an MOI of 0.25 and fixed at 1 dpi followed by immunofluorescent staining to detect viral nucleoprotein (green), cilia (A, red) and mucus (B, red) at 2 dpi, cells positive for activated caspase-3 (green) were present in swIAV-infected wdPBEC. a loss of cilia was observed in all virus-infected wdPBEC. the swIAV-infected wdPBEC lost more cilia compared to mock-infected cultures. the thickness of swIAV-infected cultures was reduced by about 50%. PBEC cultures were stained for viral nucleoprotein (green) and cilia (red). results are shown as percentages (means SEM) compared to mock-infected cultures. for each infection, six PBECs from three independent donors were measured. the epithelium forms a pseudostratified layer in the single plane image. the nuclei were stained by DAPI (blue) (A&B) for each infection, numbers of six PBECs from three independent donors were measured. the trans-epithelial electrical resistance values of mock-infected and swIAV-infected PBEC were determined at the indicated time points. each sample was performed with 3 technical replicates. the nuclei were stained by DAPI (blue) and DAPI (blue). primary PTEC and PBEC were cultured under ALI conditions for four weeks. PBEC cultures were grown under ALI conditions for at least 4 weeks. semi-thin sections followed by toluidine blue staining were performed. epithelia from porcine trachea and primary bronchus were collected. the images are shown in horizontal (top) or vertical (lower) sections. PBEC stained for SNA or MAA II (red) were co-stained for the presence of cilia or mucus (red) the pseudo-colour was applied in red and green (MAA II) both 2,3 and 2,6-linked sialic acids (green) were detected on ciliated cells (red) non-ciliated cells predominantly contained 2,6-linked sialic acid. mucin/mucus-producing cells (red) were found to have 2,6-linked but not 2,3-linked sialic acids. wdPBEC were inoculated with IAV from apical (left panels) or basolateral (right panels) sides at an MOI of 0.25. vires released from the apical side were harvested at different time points and titrated by focus-forming assay in MDCK cells. swIAV strains preferentially infect ciliated cells and some non-ciliated cells different from mucus-producing cells. WdPBECs were infected with swIAV H1N1 or H3N2 from the apical surface at an MOI of 0.25 and fixed at 1 dpi. the apoptotic cells were detected by visualizing cleaved caspase-3 (green) the pseudo-colour was applied in magenta (viral nucleoprotein) by using LAS AF Lite software for image comparison (B) arrows show co-localization, and the dashed lines indicate the location of the supporting membrane. PBECs were inoculated with IAV from the apical side at an MOI of 0.25. PBEC cultures were stained for viral nucleoprotein (green) and cilia (red) wdPBECs were fixed at 8 dpi and stained for viral nucleoprotein (green) and cilia (red) to measure thickness accurately, the vertical image stacks of 5 planes were merged. the nuclei were stained by DAPI (blue) (A&B) swIAV-H1N1-infected PBECs were inoculated from the apical or basolateral side. ALI cultures were fixed at 2 dpi (top panels) and 8 dpi (lower panels), followed by staining with anti-ZO-1 antibody (red in top panels; green in lower panels) to detect tight junction. basal cells are in process of differentiating into specialized cells. swIAVs were inoculated by swIAV H1N1 from the apical or basolateral side. cryosections were prepared at 8 dpi. the growth conditions of swALI cultures were different from those described for human ALI cultures. the difficulty in establishing this system may explain why so far only few reports about differentiated respiratory epithelial cells of swine are available. infection by IAV was detrimental for airway epithelial cells as indicated by detection of apoptotic cells. reduction was more pronounced in swIAV-infected cultures compared to cells infected by either of the two human IAV. thelial layer and the tight junction protein expression were retained during the whole infection period. the well differentiated tracheal and bronchial epithelia retain their barrier function. polarized epithelial cells were replaced by specialized cells. the loss of well-differentiated cells is compensated by the generation of polarized cells that maintain the barrier function of the epithelial cell layer. this is also the result of the maintenance of the barrier function of the airway epithelium. swIAV infection renders epithelial cell more susceptible to infection by avian IAV and thus facilitates co-infection and the appearance of reassortant viruses. primary cells were harvested on type I collagen (Sigma)-coated flasks with bronchial epithelial cell serum-free growth medium (BEGM) the beGM was modified from previous studies28,29 and contained the BEBM basal medium (Lonza) cultured cells were fixed in 5% glutaraldehyde/cacodylate buffer for 24 hours and subsequently post-fixated with 1% osmium tetroxide. sections were embedded in epoxy resin, stained with toluidine blue and evaluated by light microscopy. infected PTEC and PBEC were further maintained under ALI conditions at 37 \u00b0C in a 5% CO2. at different times, 100 L of DMEM were added to the apical surface and the cultures were incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. secondary antibodies were Alexa Fluor\u00ae 488, 568 or 633 conjugated antibodies (Life Technologies) all antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in RT for 1 h. image stacks with a z- or y-distance of 1.0 m per plane were merged. results were repeated at least with six PBECs from three independent donors. anti-tubulin antibody (mouse, Sigma), anti-actin antibody (housekeeping control, mouse, Sigma) and anti-influenza A antibody (goat, ViroStat) were used as primary antibodies. the primary antibodies were incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and the secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. TEC and PBEC were transferred to type IV collagen-coated transwell\u00ae polycarbonate membrane (24 well, 0.4 m pore size, Corning Costar) at a density of 2.5 105 cells per filter support with the air-liquid interface (ALI) medium. the cells were maintained under ALI conditions for at least 4 weeks at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. cultured cells were prefixed in glutaraldehyde (2.5%) for 24 hours and treated with osmium tetroxide (1%) for 2 hours. samples were dried under critical point drying using the E 3000 device (Polaron, USA), stuck to stubs, sputter-coated and examined under a scanning electron microscope. infected PTEC and PBEC were fixed with 3% PFA or used to generate cryosections, 20 m thick35. the binding of biotinylated lectins was visualized by fluorescence microscopy using streptavidin-Cy3 (Sigma) and 0.5% Triton X-100. all antibodies were diluted in 1% bovine serum albumin and incubated in RT for 1 h. the images were generated by ImageJ/Fuji software using maximum intensity projection filter. results were repeated at least with six PBECs from three independent donors. the primary antibodies were incubated at 4 \u00b0C overnight. the secondary antibodies were applied for 1 h at 4 \u00b0C. the differentiated airway epithelium infected by influenza viruses maintains the barrier function."}
