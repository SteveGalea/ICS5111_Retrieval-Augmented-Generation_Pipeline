{"summary": "transspecies transmission of retroviruses has been well studied. other transspecies transmissions have still not been fully analysed. transspecies transmission has also been reported for gammaretroviruses. retroviruses related to KoRV and GaLV have been described in rodents such as south east Asian mice and in two subspecies of Melomys burtoni in Australia and Indonesia [12,13] this review will analyse the hypothesis of whether these bat viruses are the origin of KoRV/GaLV. a second strain was isolated from an animal with lymphocytic leukaemia. a third strain was isolated from a gibbon with lymphocytic leukaemia. a fourth strain, GaLV-Br (brain), was isolated from two healthy gibbons inoculated with brain extracts from human patients. 79 sera from captive gibbons were isolated from a GALV-SSAV infected marmoset tumor cell line, designated GALV-MAR (Accession number U20589.1) and from an HIV-1-infected human cell line (GaLV-X) the presence of antibodies against GALV antigens was revealed in 28% of the animals, indicating previous exposure to GaLV. PBMCs and lymphoma tissues of hundreds of koalas were then isolated and cloned. it became clear that the virus may be endogenous, being integrated in the genome of normal koalas, but it may also exist as an exogenous virus. despite the taxonomical distance between gibbons and koalas, sequencing of the virus has demonstrated that KoRV is closely related to GaLV. a new receptor binding domain (RBD) in the envelope protein was created. THTR1 is used instead of Pit-1. it remains unclear whether only KoRV-B or also KoRV-A are involved in tumor induction. a novel gammaretrovirus was detected in an Australian rodent, the grassland melomys, Melomys burtoni (MbRV). a transspecies transmission of MbRV from melomys to koalas could be theoretically possible. a transspecies transmission of MbRV from melomys to koalas could be theoretically possible. a new gammaretrovirus, Melomys woolly monkey virus (MelWMV), was detected in another Melomys burtoni subspecies. this virus was detected as a result of screening 26 Southeast Asian rodent species and all other 25 species were negative. MelWMV has 98% homology with the WMV and is a subtype of WMV. related bats harbor more than 60 distinct emerging and re-emerging human viral pathogens. many endogenous retroviruses have also been described in bats. ivorous bat, and the Rousettus leschenaultia retrovirus (RIRV) from a frugivorous bat [14,15] all GaLV are able to grow on CCL-88 bat lung fibroblasts [20], which serves as a strong indicator that mammalian retroviruses may have originated in bats. a widespread distribution of KoRV in the late 1800s was described [60]. melomys can be excluded as the origin of the GaLV because all Melomys species never crossed the Wallace line. modern viruses related to GaLV/KoRV from a species able to infect koalas and gibbons in captivity may be the best candidates for the GaLV/KoRV precursor. gammaretroviruses related to PERV can also infect human cells in vitro. no transmission of PERV was also observed in the first clinical xenotransplantations (more than 200 patients), in numerous pig to non-human primate transplantations and in PERV infection experiments. 62 proviruses were inactivated using a zinc finger nuclease (ZFN) [69], or clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) acting with CRISPR-associated nuclease 9 (Cas9) [70]. the question is whether this strategy can be used to generate PERV-free animals suitable for xenotransplantation."}
