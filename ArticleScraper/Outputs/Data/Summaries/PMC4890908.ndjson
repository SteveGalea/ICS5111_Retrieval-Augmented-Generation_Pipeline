{"summary": "autophagosomes are formed by expansion and sealing of a small cistern known as the phagophore or isolation membrane. once complete, they fuse with the mammalian lysosomes or plant and yeast vacuoles to expose their cargo to the hydrolytic interior of these compartments for degradation. the metabolites generated in the lysosomes/vacuoles are subsequently transported in the cytoplasm and used as either an energy source or building blocks for the autophagosomes can thus exclusively sequester and degrade mitochondria (i.e., mitophagy), peroxisomes (i.e., pexophagy), endoplasmic reticulum (ER-phagy or reticulophagy), endosomes/lysosomes, lipid droplets (i.e., lipophagy), secretory granules (i.e., lipophagy), cytoplasmic aggregate autophagy participates in a multitude of physiological processes essential to maintain cellular and organismal homeostasis. adaptation to starvation, cell differentiation and development, degradation of aberrant structures, turnover of superfluous or damaged organelles, tumorsuppression, innate and adaptive immunity, lifespan extension, and type II programmed cell death. the WIPI's is a protein family which comprises 4 members. the LC3's is a protein family that comprises 6 proteins. three of them have been shown to be involved in autophagy. mTOR dissociates from this complex provoking a dephosphorylation of ULK1 and ULK2 necessary for the activation of their kinase activity. the complex is formed by Vps34/hVPS34, Vps15/p115, Atg6/BECLIN1 and Atg14/ATG14L. the role in autophagy of this lipid is unclear. mATG9 regulates autophagy induction in mmalian cells. lipid kinase activity of hVPS34 is inhibited when BECLIN1 is not part of the complex. autophagy positive regulators such as AMBRA1 and BIF-1 promote hVPS34. the high mobile cytoplasmic structures are probably 30\u201360 nm vesicles. the less mobile appear to be constituted by clusters of vesicles and tubules. yeast Atg9 cycles between the cytoplasmic pools and the PAS. elongation of the phagophores and completion/sealing of autophagosomes appear to rely on the function of these two ubiquitin-like systems. the function of the Atg12-Atg5Atg16 oligomer in autophagy is unclear. atg8 is a second ubiquitin-like protein participating in autophagy. Atg8 is found inside and outside the vesicles of autophagosomes. atg4 cleaves the Atg8-PE pool on the surface releasing Atg8 back in the cytoplasm for reuse. these data, however, are controversial [68]. studies on the selective elimination of either mitochondria or Salmonella suggest that the Atg proteins can be grouped into clusters. these clusters mirror almost entirely the organization in functional groups of the Atg proteins. lipid bilayers composing autophagosomes have been implicated as the possible source of the autophagosomal membranes. the ER plays a central role in this event because growing phagophores have been observed in close proximity of this organelle. it has been postulated that transfers could occur by direct lipid translocation from the ER to the nascent autophagosome. this event is a requisite for the fusion of these carriers with the vacuole. the cell possesses a regulatory factor to avoid premature and potentially harmful fusion of incomplete double-membrane vesicles with the vacuole/lysosome. it remains to be identified this factor (or factors) that is able to sense the autophagosome completion and thus trigger PtdIns3P turnover. a central objective in the field of autophagy is to assign a function to the Atg proteins. atg1/ULK Complex Atg1 is a serine/threonine protein kinase that has a key role in autophagy induction. different proteins associate to form a complex with Atg1. mTOR inhibits autophagy through direct modulation of the Atg1/ULK complex. atg14 is a subunit of the autophagy-specific PtdIns3K complex in yeast and in mammals. atg14 is a subunit of the autophagy-specific PtdIns3K complex. hVPS34 is present on the surface and interior of autophagosomes. the atg9 Cycling System Atg9 is another protein found at an early stage of the PAS formation. it possesses six conserved transmembrane domains with the two cytoplasm-oriented termini. it is the only integral membrane protein among the core Atg machinery [50] two other core Atg proteins, Atg2 and Atg18, are involved in Atg9 cycling. in yeast, Atg2 and Atg18 form a cytoplasmic complex. the presence of this lipid at the PAS is necessary for its recruitment to this site. atg8 is a second ubiquitin-like protein participating in autophagy. it is posttranslationally processed by the specific cysteine protease Atg4, which cleaves its C-terminal amino acids exposing a glycine residue. atg8 is covalently conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine. the atg8 population associated with autophagosome inner membrane is essential for the selective sequestration of specific cargoes. additional factors play a crucial role in the autophagosome biogenesis especially in high eukaryotes. most of the studies about the PAS have been done in yeast. a discrepancy between the different reports could be due to the ability of cells to derive the membranes from the most suitable reservoirs depending on the tissues and conditions triggering autophagy. an alternative option would be that the diverse Atg functional clusters that come together to generate the PAS are associated to membranes derived from different compartments. the challenge for the future will be to understand the mechanism underlying the integrated interaction between the different Atg functional groups. serine/threonine protein kinase has key role in autophagy induction. different proteins associate to form a complex with Atg1. kinase is associated with Atg13, Atg17 and two nonconserved subunits. the formation of PtdIns3P depends on the activity of PtdIns3 kinase class III hVPS34, which is present on the surface of various organelles. atg14 is a subunit of the autophagy-specific PtdIns3K complex in yeast and in mammals. the atg9 Cycling System Atg9 is the only integral membrane protein among the core Atg machinery [50] it possesses six conserved transmembrane domains with the two cytoplasm-oriented termini. mATG9 localizes to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in fed cells and partially to the late endosomes. yeast, Atg2 and Atg18 form a cytoplasmic complex [57, 58] in yeast, atg2 and Atg18 form a cytoplasmic complex. the presence of this lipid at the PAS is necessary for its recruitment to this site [59] the function of the Atg12-Atg5Atg16 oligomer in autophagy is unclear. but it seems that it acts as an E3 ligase for the generation of the lipidated form of Atg8/LC3. atg8 is a second ubiquitin-like protein participating in autophagy. atg proteins are cytosolic and associate to form the PAS by interacting with other Atg components and/or lipids upon autophagy induction [3, 50, 72] studies have shown that the core Atg proteins assemble following a hierarchical order and form this autophagosomal precursor [73\u201375] an alternative option would be that the diverse Atg functional clusters are associated to membranes derived from different compartments. this would explain why endosomes, the plasma membrane, and the Golgi have all been shown to contribute to the formation of the early autophagosomal intermediates. the challenge for the future will be to understand the mechanism underlying the integrated interaction between the different Atg functional groups. atg8/LC3 is a ubiquitin-like protein that is covalently conjugated to autophagosomal membranes. failure to release Atg8 form the autophagosome surface by Atg8-PE delipidation leads to an impairment of autophagy [84, 85] this event is a requisite for the fusion of these carriers with the vacuole. regulator of autophagy is mTOR and represses this pathway by blocking the activity of the atg1/ULK1 complex through direct phosphorylation. mTOR is inhibited when amino acids are scarce, growth factor signaling is reduced and/or ATP concentrations fall. autophagy receptors are defined as proteins being able to interact directly with both the structure that has to be specifically eliminated by autophagy and the pool of the atg8/LC3 protein family members present in the internal surface of growing autophagosomes [7, 97]. this latter interaction is in most of the cases mediated through a specific sequence present in the autophagy receptors and commonly referred to as the LC3-interacting region (LIR) motif [98]. the phosphorylation of Atg30 and Atg32 promotes the association and recruitment of Atg11. this leads to the formation of a double-membrane vesicle around the organelle. the phosphorylation of Atg30 and Atg32 is present in Pichia pastoris. cleave the profragment of the hydrolases composing the oligomer leading to both their activation and disassembly of this structure. the extracellular delivery of the cytosolic Acyl coenzyme-A-(CoA-) binding protein in the yeast Pichia pastoris and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (ACBP) and the social amoebae Dictyostelium discoideum (Acb yeast cells expand their ER volume to accommodate newly synthesized chaperones. this phenomenon is accompanied by the formation and accumulation of autophagosomes that are densely and selectively packed with ER membranes. this phenomenon is accompanied by the formation and accumulation of autophagosomes that are densely and selectively packed with ER membranes. this pathway still requires ULK1/Atg1, FIP200/Atg17, BECLIN1/Atg6, and hVPS34/Vps34 [119]. the autophagy-specific PtdIns3K complex I controls autophagy induction and BECLIN1 can be part of it. studies on the role of autophagy in immunity have revealed a different picture. individual Atg proteins or Atg functional groups can also be part of other processes. the ERAD tuning is a transport pathway out of the ER that mediates the rapid turnover of specific ERAD factors in the endosomal system. studies with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have revealed that the ATG5 and ATG7 gene products are not required for the formation of the virus-induced DMVs. LC3-I (but not LC3-I) is associated to and essential for the formation of the intracellular inclusions of the Chlamydia trachomatis. the formation of the aBCVs is essential for both the intracellular life cycle and cell-to-cell spreading of Brucella. it requires proteins involved in the induction of autophagosome biogenesis. it remains to be understood whether this microbe is either subverting part of the Atg machinery or exploiting a pathway that uses a subset of the Atg proteins. LC3 is rapidly recruited to phagosomes in a manner that depends on ATG5, ATG7, BECLIN1 and hVPS34. work in C. elegans on the same process has also implicated Atg18/WIPI. inhibition of the formation of the membranous cytoplasmic replication complexes depends on the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate, ATG7 and ATG16L1. this response does not require the Atg8/LC3-processing protein ATG4B indicating that it uses just one of the two conjugation systems. it remains unclear how these Atg proteins are carrying out their antiviral action. autophagosomes expel engulfed material, mostly of plasma membrane. autophagosomes expel engulfed material, mostly of plasma membrane. autophagosomes expel engulfed material, mostly of plasma membrane. picornaviruses exploit autophagosomes to secrete their newly synthesized virions. yeast cells expand their ER volume to accommodate newly synthesized chaperones. this phenomenon is accompanied by the formation and accumulation of autophagosomes that are densely packed with ER membranes. autophagosomes out of the Golgi perform autophagy-mediated protein degradation in an ATG5-, ATG7-, ATG9-, and ATG16-independent way. this pathway still requires ULK1/Atg1, FIP200/Atg17, BECLIN1/Atg6, and hVPS34/Vps34 [119] studies on the role of autophagy in immunity, especially in the context of specific viral and bacterial infections, have revealed a different picture. the ERAD tuning is a transport pathway out of the ER that mediates the rapid turnover of specific ERAD factors in the endosomal system [127\u2013129] studies with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) have revealed that the ATG5 and ATG7 gene products are not required for the formation of the virus-induced DMVs. LC3-I (but not LC3-I) is associated to and essential for the formation of the intracellular inclusions of the Chlamydia trachomatis inclusions. aBCVs formation is essential for the intracellular life cycle and cell-to-cell spreading of Brucella. it requires proteins involved in the induction of autophagosome biogenesis. it remains to be understood whether this microbe is subverting part of the Atg machinery. LC3 is rapidly recruited to phagosomes in a manner that depends on ATG5, ATG7, BECLIN1 and hVPS34. work in C. elegans on the same process has also implicate Atg18/WIPI. the direct antiviral activity of IFN against murine norovirus depends on the ATG5-ATG12 conjugate, ATG7 and ATG16L1 but not on the induction of autophagy. it remains unclear how Atg8/LC3-processing protein ATG4B is carrying out their antiviral action. it will be interesting to analyze whether components of other Atg functional groups are involved in this response. us will continue to astonish us for some time. of surprises and autophagy will continue to astonish us."}
