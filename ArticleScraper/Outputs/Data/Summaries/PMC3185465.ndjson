{"summary": "coronaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses found in humans and a wide variety of animals. in humans, coronaviruses can cause respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity. coronaviruses possess a unique mechanism of viral replication that leads to high frequencies of recombination. two human coronaviruses were discovered in the 1960s. HCoV-229E was a group 1 coronavirus and HCoV-OC43 was a group 2 coronavirus. up to December 2008, 16 novel coronaviruses were discovered and their complete genomes sequenced. logenetic analysis of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of coronaviruses with complete genome sequences available by the end of 2008. the tree was constructed by neighbor joining method using Kimura's two-parameter correction and bootstrap values calculated from 1000 trees. nine hundred and fifty eight amino acids were included in the analysis. HCoV-HKU1 genomes range from 29,295 to 30,097 nucleotides. the size of the genomes of HCoV-HKU1 genomes are 32%. HCoV-HKU1 genomes are the lowest among all known coronaviruses with complete genome sequences available. predicted ORF 1ab, encoding the nonstructural polyproteins (nsp1 to nsp16) and ORFs encoding the HE, S, E, M and N structural proteins are indicated. major parts of ORF 1ab (PL1pro, PL2pro, 3CLpro, pol and helicase) encoding key enzymatic activities are colored in yellow. the nsp3 of HCoV-HKU1 is the longest nsp3 among all coronaviruses with complete genomes available. at least three genotypes, genotype A, B and C, of HCoV-HKU1 have been observed. pol, S and N genes of clinical strains HCoV-HKU1 were clustered with genotype A and B. analysis of a single gene is not sufficient for genotyping of HCoV-HKU1. would require sequencing of at least two gene loci, one from nsp10 to nsp16, such as pol or helicase, and another from HE to N, such as S or N. biogenesis, subcellular localization and intracellular trafficking of S in HCoV-HKU1 as well as its interaction with major histocompatibility complex class I C molecule no HCoV-HKU1 was detected in screening more than 10,000 animal specimens. dn/ds ratios of all ORFs in the genomes of HCoV-HKU1 are low. incidence of HCoV-HKU1 infections is the highest in winter. of patients/specimens positive for HCoV-HKU1 positive patients with underlying diseases No. (%) of patients/specimens positive for other human coronaviruses Outcome HCoV-OC43 HCoV-229E HCoV-NL63 1 [42] Hong Kong 418 patients Hospitalized patients with community-acquired pneumonia 12 months (Mar 2003 \u2013 Mar 2004) 10 (2.4) 8 (80) Not performed Not performed Not performed Not children with acute respiratory infection or related conditions at the Pediatric Department 12 months (Oct 2004 \u2013 Sep 2005) 0 (0) - 6 (2.6) 0 (0) 1 (0.4) - 9 [15] Italy 685 specimens from 426 patients Hospitalized patients with acute respiratory tract infections 7 months (Nov 2005 \u2013 May 2006) 10 (2.3) patients 8 (80) 8 (1.9) patients 20 (4.7) patients 11 (2.6) patients Not mentioned 10 [8] Korea 231 children Hospitalized children 15 [20] Jordan 325 children Children with acute respiratory infection admitted to the pediatric wards 6 months (Dec 2003 \u2013 May 2004) 0 (0) - Not performed Not performed 4 (1.2) - 16 [3] Italy 322 infants Hospitalized infants with acute respiratory disease 24 months (Oct 2004 \u2013 Sep 2006) 6 (1.9) Not mentioned 11 (3.4) 1 (0.3) 10 (3.1) Not mentioned 17 [1] Italy 85 infants Infants hospitalized for the first acute episode 1 in 25 healthy blood donors was 48%, similar to those for HCoV-OC43 (52%), HCoV-229E (56%) and HCoV-NL63 (60%). a study of a US metropolitan population using baculovirus-expressed recombinant ELISA showed the presence of human coronaviruses. virus in >2% of control patients raised questions about the role of human coronaviruses in pneumonia. no antiviral drugs or vaccines for HCoV-HKU1 and other human coronaviruses are available. HCoV-HKU1 infection was associated with febrile seizures. gene targets and primer sequences for HCoV-HKU1 detection. sensitivity was found to be similar to that of real-time RT-PCR. sensitivity was found to be similar to that of real-time RT-PCR.
