{"summary": "carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related cell adhesion molecules CEACAM1 (BGP, CD66a), CEACAM5 (CEA, CD66e) and CEACAM6 (NCA, CD66c) are expressed in human lung. they play a role in innate immunity and are targets for various bacterial and viral adhesins. interferons alpha, beta and gamma also increased CEACAM5 expression. NTHI and M. catarrhalis increased CEACAM1 mRNA levels. this effect was independent of the ability to bind to CEACAM1. pathogen binding to CEACAM1 is of especial importance since it leads to the suppression of several receptors that activate important cellular pathways of the innate or adaptive immune response. the interferences with TLR signaling and the interference with T-cell activation by CEACAM1 depend on the phosphorylation of the immuno-receptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif (ITIM) contained within the cell membrane. the four most commonly co-expressed CEACAM1 isoforms chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality. it is expected to be the third leading cause of death, and fifth leading cause of disability by 2020 [29] a comprehensive analysis of (co-) expression patterns of CEACAM1 isoforms, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in the different lung tissues is lacking. CEACAM1 expression was enhanced upon exposure to interferons, the agonist polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), M. catarrhalis, and NTHi. rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (Dako), rabbit polyclonal anti-CEA IgG (Dako), rabbit polyclonal anti-cea IgG (Dako), rabbit polyclonal anti- mouse IgG (Dianova), rabbit polyclonal anti-CEA IgG (Dako), rabbit polyclonal anti-mouse IgG (Dako), rabbit polyclonal anti-cea Ig bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples were obtained from 181 individuals in which a bronchoscopy was performed for different diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. all samples were available as residual material without any personal information or clinical data. the standard and the undiluted samples were incubated over night at 4\u00b0C. plates were washed three times with PBS and supplemented with a goat anti mouse antibody. the reaction was stopped by 20 l of 2 N H2SO4 (Carl Roth) NHBE cells were treated with 100 ng/ml IFN (interferon alpha 1a, ImmunoTools), 100 ng/ml IFN (recombinant human interferon gamma, Promokine), 100 ng/ml TNF (recombinant human interferon gamma, Promokine), 100 ng/ml MALP-2 (Enzo Life Sciences GmbH), 100 ng/ml poly I:C (high molecular weight bacteria were freshly grown over night at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 on Columbia Agar or chocolate Agar, respectively. for infection, bacteria were freshly grown over night at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 on Columbia Agar or chocolate Agar, respectively. for infection, bacteria were freshly grown over night at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 on Columbia Agar or chocolate Agar.

PCRs were carried out on a thermal cycler (BioRad) in a 25 l reaction volume containing 0.2 M primers, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (5-Prime) and 200 M dNTPs. the resulting PCR products were separated on an ethidium bromide containing agarose gel and visualized under a UV-transiluminator. the expression levels were normalized to the geometric mean of 2 housekeeping genes: hypoxanthine phosphoribosyltransferase1 (HPRT1) and peptidylpropyl isomerase B (PPIB) the stability of the housekeeping genes was assessed using the BestKeeper algorithm [47] analysis was done using the FACSAria II (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo (Tree Star Inc.) software. materials and antibodies All materials used were from Sigma or Merck unless stated otherwise. 5C8C4, 1H7-4B and 6/40c were performed on paraffin wax sections obtained from 19 different human lung sections. sections were deparaffinized (Histoclear 3 5 min, ethanol 100% 5 min, ethanol 96% 5 min, ethanol 80% 5 min, ethanol 70% 5 min) and rehydrated (H2O 2 5 min). 96 well micro titer plates were coated for 2 h with 3 g/ml rabbit anti-CEA-antibody (Dako) diluted in PBS. all unbound sites were blocked for 2 h with PBS containing 3% bovine serum albumin (Carl Roth GmbH) smoke from one cigarette was bubbled through 10 ml complete medium using a peristaltic pump (P-1, GE Healthcare) the filtered CSE was regarded as 100%. NHBE cells were induced to secrete IL-8 and remained viable after tratment with 4% CSE for 24 h. ng/ml TNF (recombinant human tumor necrosis factor alpha, R&D Systems), 100 ng/ml MALP-2 (Enzo Life Sciences GmbH), 100 ng/ml poly I:C (high molecular weight, InvivoGene), 100 ng/ml flagellin (Invivogene Biotech), or 4% CSE. for infection, bacteria were freshly grown over night at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 on Columbia Agar or Chocolate cells were infected for 24 h at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 5 (Moraxella catarrhalis) or 100 (NTHi) Optimal MOIs were determined by analysis of maximal induction of interleukin 8 secretion in the absence of cytotoxic effects. immunoprecipitations from cell culture supernatants NHBE cell culture supernatants from confluent cells were harvested after 48 h. a nanodrop D-1000 Spectrophotometer was used to assess the amount and quality of the isolated RNA samples. primers for each target were designed using the primer-BLAST tool of the national center for biotechnology information. PCRs of the cDNAs were carried out on a S1000TM Thermal Cycler (BioRad) in a 25 l reaction volume containing 0.2 M primers, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (5-Prime) and 200 M each sample was analyzed in duplicate in a total reaction volume of 20 l containing 10 l of 2 SensiMix SYBR Master Mix (Bioline) and 0.2 M of each primer. the cycling conditions included an initial step of 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s, 60\u00b0C for 20 s. images were processed using the Zen Software (Zeiss) and Adobe Photoshop. NHBE cells were cultured and treated as described above. cells were stained using antibodies B3-17 (CEACAM1) and 2H8-5 (CEACAM5) at 10 g/ml. 8 showed strong staining if infiltrated granulocytes appeared (data not shown) and did not give any staining above IgG background in granulocyte-free lung tissues (Table 2). Figure 1. Patient characteristics Male 9 Female 10 Age 34-80 years Smoker 6 Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) CEACAM expression in non-cancer tissues was analyzed for alveolar epithelium, bronchial epithelium, adventitia submucosa, pleura and blood vessel endothelium. not all tissue types were found for all specimens, the number of positive specimen and the number of total specimen including the respective tissue. adventitia submucosa and blood vessel endothelium did not show any CEACAM6 expression. co-expression patterns of CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in the different lung tissues of the 19 specimens were also analyzed. bronchial epithelium, adventitia submucosa, pleura and blood vessel endothelium were stained for CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6. non-cancer tissues were analyzed for the co-expression of CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6. stainings for CEACAM1, CEACAM5 or CEACAM6 are missing in a specimen preventing an evaluation. no correlation was found for either the presence or expression level of CEACAM1, CEACAM5 or CEACAM6 linked to COPD or smoking status. soluble CEACAMs are present in human airways Next, the presence of soluble CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was evaluated. CEACAM5 was present in 4 out of 181 BALF samples (2.2%) soluble CEACAM1 isoforms CEACAM1-4C1, CEACAM1-3 and CEACAM1-3C2 were tested by RT-PCR. NHBE cells were tested for the expression of soluble CEACAM1 isoforms CEACAM1-4C1, CEACAM1-3 and CEACAM1-3C2. RT-PCR and subsequent sequencing of the obtained PCR-products confirmed the expression of three soluble CEACAM1 isoforms. mRNAs of all three isoforms were not expressed at sufficient levels to allow for reliable quantification analysis by qPCR. mRNAs of all three isoforms were not expressed at sufficient levels to allow for reliable quantification analysis by qPCR. NHBE cells were treated with IFN, IFN, IFN, TNF and the TLR agonists MALP-2 (TLR2/6), poly I:C (TLR3) and flagellin (TLR5). RNA from these cells was isolated and qPCR analysis was used to check for differences in CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-3L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-3S, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 mRNA levels. the four transmembrane CEACAM1-isoforms were basically co-regulated by all reagents that elicit a difference in transcription levels. IFN significantly upregulated the expression of CEACAM1-4L (3.7-fold, p 0.05), CEACAM1-4S (4.8-fold, p 0.05) and CEACAM1-3S (4.3-fold, p 0.001). IFN seemed to favor the two long isoforms CEACAM1-4L (4.4-fold) and CEACAM1-3L (5.2-fold) when compared to the short variants CEACAM1-4S (4.2-fold) and CEACAM1-3S (3.5-fold) no significant alteration in the ratios between long and short CEACAM1 isoforms was observed. confluent NHBE cells were incubated with poly I:C for 4, 8 and 24 h. qPCR showed that poly I:C strongly induced an immediate IFN expression (780-fold increase after 4 h) that dissolved after 24 h. no difference in CEACAM5 mRNA levels were induced by CSE, IFN, IFN, TNF, or any of the TLR agonists. 1 showed a low expression on most cells, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6, respectively, were only expressed by a subpopulation. FACS analysis confirmed an increased expression of CEACAM1 on the cell surface of NHBE cells. the CEACAM1-specific antibody used for flow cytometry did not allow discrimination between the different isoforms. increased CEACAM5 cell surface expression upon IFN treatment could be confirmed by FACS analysis. however, it remained only a defined portion of NHBE cells that were CEACAM5 positive. both M. catarrhalis and NTHi 2019 induced only a very small increase in IFN mRNA levels in NHBE cells that in part were not significant. however, M. catarrhalis induced as a secondary effect a significant 10.9-fold increase in IFN mRNA levels after 24 h. incubated with M. catarrhalis strain 25238 or NTHi strain 2019 for 4 h, 8 h or 24 h. subjected to qPCR analysis for IFN mRNA expression. dashed lines represent the median expression. boxes and whiskers represent the interquartile range. paraffin sections of human lung tissue from surgical specimens of lung cancer patients were stained for CEACAM1, CEACAM5, CEACAM6 and an unspecific control IgG. blood cells give a positive signal due to intrinsic peroxidase activity. total staining includes alveolar epithelium, bronchial epithelium, adventitia submucosa, pleura and blood vessel endothelium. four lung sections showed enhanced background staining for the control IgG or the anti-CEACAM8 antibody. in alveolar epithelium, CEACAM6 was present in all specimens. only CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 expressions varied. both proteins were co-expressed with CEACAM5 alone and with each other. most of the CEACAM6-negative specimens showed pleura staining. CC1+/CC5+/CC6- - - 3 4 4 8 CC1+/CC5+/CC6- - - - 1 - CC1-/CC5+/CC6+ 6 8 7 - 1 - CC1-/CC5+/CC6- - - - 7 4 7 CC1-/CC5+/CC6+ 1 2 - 1 - - - - - - - sections, including alveolar epithelium, bronchial epithelium, adventitia submucosa, pleura and blood vessel endothelium, were assessed in the range of 0 (no staining) to 3 (strong staining) however, no correlation was found for either the presence (data not shown) or the expression levels (Table 4) of the tested CEACAMs according to two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. paraffin sections of human lung tissue from surgical specimens of lung cancer patients were stained for CEACAM1, CEACAM5, CEACAM6, CEACAM8 and an unspecific control IgG. no significant differences were found in comparison to the respective control groups according to two-tailed Student\u2019s t-test. NHBE cells were tested for expression of soluble CEACAM1 isoforms. mRNAs of all three isoforms were not expressed at sufficient levels. mRNAs of all three isoforms were not expressed at sufficient levels. soluble CEACAM6 and low amounts of soluble CEACAM1, but no soluble CEACAM5 in NHBE cell culture supernatants. NHBE cells expressed CEACAM5 and CEACAM6, as well as the CEACAM1 isoforms CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-3L and CEACAM1-3S. 1-4S, CEACAM1-3S, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 mRNA levels showed a highly stable expression, allowing for normalization with the geometric means of both genes. we tested two housekeeping genes for their stability across the unstimulated and stimulated samples. the four transmembrane CEACAM1-isoforms CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-3L, CEACAM1-4S and CEACAM1-3S were basically co-regulated by all reagents that elicit a difference in transcription levels. IFN significantly upregulated the expression of CEACAM1-4L (3.7-fold, p 0.05), CEACAM1-4S (4.8-fold, p 0.05) and CEACAM1-3S (4.3-fold, p poly I:C treatment also up-regulated all four isoforms of CEACAM1 in a significant manner. expression ratios ranging between 4.9 and 7.0-fold were calculated using REST2009. CSE, TNF, MALP-2 and flagellin had no effect on any of the four isoforms. qPCR showed that poly I:C strongly induced an immediate IFN expression (780-fold increase after 4 h) that dissolved after 24 h. no difference in CEACAM5 mRNA levels were induced by CSE, IFN, IFN, TNF, or any of the TLR agonists. NHBE cells were left untreated or incubated for 24 h with polyI:C, IFN, IFN or IFN. data are representative of three experiments with similar results. the effects of acute NTHi and Moraxella catarrhalis infection on CEACAM1, CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 expression levels were investigated. qPCR analysis revealed no differences in CEACAM5 and CEACAM6 expression upon bacterial infection. M. catarrhalis 25238 and NTHi 2019 induced only a very small increase in IFN mRNA levels in NHBE cells that in part were not significant. however, M. catarrhalis induced as a secondary effect a significant 10.9-fold increase in IFN mRNA levels after 24 h. cells were subjected to qPCR analysis of CEACAM1-4L, CEACAM1-3L, CEACAM1-4S, CEACAM1-3 CEACAM1, CEACAM5, and CEACAM6 are frequently co-expressed in several tissues of the human lung, including epithelia of the airways and alveoli. despite the analysis of non-cancer tissues from the specimen, the fact that the lung sections used for immunohistochemical analysis were from patients that underwent lung resection. this interaction would be facilitated by an impaired mucocilliary clearance, which is associated with later phases of COPD. this setting would also explain the association of bacterial colonization with progressive/advanced disease. further studies including identification of pathogens in the lower airways will be necessary to shed light on this aspect of CEACAM-pathogen interactions. soluble CEACAM6 in all and lower concentrations of soluble CEACAM5 in 78.5% of the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid samples is mirrored in the expression levels of their membrane-bound counterparts in lung tissues. the fact that soluble CEACAM1 is all but absent in BALF (98% negative BALF samples) increases the importance of this receptor for colonization by pathogens. long and short isoforms can appear as monomers, dimers and oligomeric microclusters in the membrane. binding of CEACAM1-L to Shp-1 or c-Src is dependent on balance between the oligomeric states. no cytoplasmic domain is necessary for the CEACAM1-mediated internalization of H. influenzae, M.catarrhalis and N. gonorrhea. in the present study CEACAM5 is up-regulated in NHBE cells by IFN. but not by type I interferons, and CEACAM1 is increased by type I and type II interferons. a temporal association between bacterial and viral infections is often observed in the human upper respiratory tract. al cells and two negative-stranded RNA viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human parainfluenza virus 3 (HPIV-3), enhance CEACAM1 expression in NHBE cells. this is the first indication that the pathogen receptor CEACAM1 might also be up-regulated via TLR3. this was probably due to its initial high expression level in the NHBE cells. rhalis and NTHi are also able to increase the expression of their receptor CEACAM1. CEACAM1 is a well-established receptor for bacteria, including the human pathogens M. catarrhalis and H. influenza that colonize about one third of all COPD patients and cause acute exacerbations. authors\u2019 contributions HS conceived, designed and coordinated the study.
