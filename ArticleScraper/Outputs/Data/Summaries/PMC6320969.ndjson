{"summary": "HSV-1 is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus belonging to the Herpesviridae family. it is the main cause of oral infection, affecting the mouth and lips. in the nervous system, the virus is protected from the host immune system as a latent state. NP is a promising approach to improve drug uptake for a specific cell line. polymeric nanoparticles (NP) are biocompatible and biodegradable polymers. polymers are completely eliminated from the body by natural metabolic pathways. nanoprecipitation (solvent displacement method) is a one-step procedure controlled by interfacial deposition. evaporation method is a two-step procedure in which the organic solution is emulsified in the aqueous phase using a high-speed homogenization or ultrasonication. the formation of NP occurs due to the polymer precipitation after the solvent evaporation. this phenomenon justifies drawbacks of less-well protected drug from degradation and a faster drug release. the anti-HSV performance was assessed using Vero E6 cells. Materials Chloroquine Diphosphate (CQ), Poloxamer 407 (Pluronic\u00ae F-127) and Poloxamer 188 (Pluronic\u00ae F-68) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. both aqueous and organic phase were previously filtered using a 0.45 m membrane (Sartorius\u00ae) the organic solvent evaporation occurred under magnetic stirring at 720 rpm, at 25 \u00b0C, overnight. samples were stored in hermetically sealed glass flasks, at 8 \u00b0C. a small-scale liquid-liquid partition procedure was performed. 0.4 mL of 0.5 M NaHCO3 aqueous solution (pH = 8.4) (0.4 mL) containing CQ at 1.25% w/v. the flask was stirred by vortex for 3 cycles of 10 seconds each. after the partitioning step, the supernatant (NaHCO3 solution) was removed.

Vero cells (2 104 cells/well) were cultured in 96-well plates in L-15 medium with 10% of FBS and maintained at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. after 24 h, the cells were exposed to decreasing concentrations (30, 20, 10, 5, and 2.5 g mL1) of CQ dissolved in L-15 at 2% were filtered through a 0.22 m sterile filter (Sartorius \u00ae), and CQ-NP and B-NP were filtered the titer of the virus preparation was 3.75 107 PFU/mL. for the plaque reduction assay, vero cell monolayers were infected with 100 PFU/well of the HSV-1 for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. after incubation, the viral inoculum was removed and the cells were washed with PBS. cells were stained with naphthol blue-black (Sigma) the number of plaques in each well were then counted. all measurements were carried out in duplicate (two plates) with three replicates for each dilution. two alkaline aqueous phases were tested aiming to improve the EE% (Formulations 4 and 5) due to the pH-dependent solubility character of the CQ, two alkaline aqueous phases were tested. the formulation 5, produced using 0.5 M NaHCO3, induced an EE% of about 25%. data are expressed as mean standard deviation (n = 3). 1 CQ, chloroquine diphosphate; 2 PLA, poly(lactic acid); 3 AP, aqueous phase; 4 PdI, polydispersity index; 5 ZP, zeta potential; 6 EE%, encapsulation efficiency. lich Parabolic B-NP 283.9 53.2 0.27 0.05 25.4 11.6 - - - - 6 297.3 26.1 0.30 0.03 20.0 12.0 64.1 5.0 0.004 h1 (0.88) 0.26 h0.65 (0.94) 63.99 (0.94) 2.25 h0.5 (0.95) the data are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) (n = 2). Data were subjected to four different diffusion kinetic linear models. the first-order model (Figure 2B), the Bhaskar model (Figure 2C), the Freundlich model (Figure 2D), and the parabolic model (Figure 2E). the parabolic diffusion model fitted the CQ release from PLA nanoparticles better than the others mathematical models. the experimental experiment with CQ-NP considered a serial dilution (70\u20132.5 g mL1) to evaluate the effect of NP on the drug toxicity at the same conditions as the anterior experiments. the concentration of 70 g mL1 was used as starting point for serial dilution, once cell viability above 80% was achieved after the treatment with a CQ at 62.5 g mL1. 5.4 6.7 0.6 33.0 CQ-NP 67.9 2.1 4.3 1.4 15.6 Data are expressed as mean standard deviation (SD) from three independent experiments with each treatment performed in triplicate. 1 CC50 = concentration that was cytotoxic for 50% of the vero cells; 2 IC50 = concentration that inhibited viral replication by 50%. the results suggested that CQ showed the ability to inhibit 100% of viral replication at 30 g mL1. at the concentration range from 5 to 20 g mL1, the CQ-NP had an inhibitory activity considerable higher than CQ with p 0.001. a smaller difference p 0.05 (*) was observed at the concentration of 2.5 g mL1. 250 nm with negative zeta potential and narrow particle size distribution were identified for tested formulations. three different CQ:PLA ratios were tested using the same slightly acid aqueous phase (pH = 6.4) however, EE% levels less than 11% were identified for these samples, which decreased according to the CQ: PLA ratio. an adjusted emulsification-solvent evaporation method was used. an average level of 97.51% of CQ-fb dissolved in the DCM was achieved.
