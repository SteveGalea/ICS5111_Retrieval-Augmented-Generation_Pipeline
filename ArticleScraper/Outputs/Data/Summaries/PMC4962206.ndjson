{"summary": "human population has increased from 200 million 2000 years ago [2] to almost 7.5 billion today [3], a multiple of almost 40. the growth rate has fallen, but world population still rises by 80 million per annum [3] the biosphere refers to the thin film beneath, on and above the surface of the Earth. the combined biomass of humans and the animals that humans domesticated outnumber that of wild mammals by at least 35:1 [2]. the same review estimates that there are fewer than 50,000 bison left in the us, and less than half a million africa elephants [2]. in some marine ecosystems the numbers of \u201cpest\u201d species such as jellyfish have reached plague proportions, leading to surprises including the temporary disablement of the recently commissioned USS Ronald Reagan. the most obvious pathway to the impoverishment or even the annihilation of humans is via widespread conflict involving nuclear weapons [17]. slower pathways to bleak futures, ending in impoverishment, lower numbers, and lower living standards are plausible. climate change can be conceptualized as a \u201crisk multiplier\u201d for conflict, not only in Syria, but in Darfur and Somalia [31,35], and in many unsettling future scenarios. two recent papers warn that life in parts of the Middle East and North Africa, especially near the Persian Gulf, will become increasingly difficult under some plausible climate change scenarios by 2100. the literature on these topics, outside health, is too large to systematically review here. the main purpose of this paper is to distil (and introduce to some) key relevant concepts to readers whose predominant training is in health. the terms and concepts which this paper will discuss are the \u201cAnthropocene\u201d, the \u201cEarth system\u201d, \u201cPlanetary Boundaries\u201d, \u201cLimits to Growth\u201d and \u201ceco-social tipping points\u201d. the article will consider the health implications of these interacting phenomena, including for disadvantaged populations. it will also describe health-earth, a research and advocacy network formed in 2014. it will also describe health-earth, which seeks to advance knowledge and understanding of these issues within the health community. the term's attraction has been complicated by debate concerning the date of its origin. it has been proposed to vary from when hominims commenced using fire [41], to as recently as 1945, when the first nuclear weapon was exploded [5]. it also been argued that the entire Holocene can be conceptualized as the Anthropocene [42] the onset of open hostility is another example of a social phase change. the onset of open hostility is another example of a social phase change. the onset of open hostility is another example of a social phase change. these are shown in alphabetical order, together with their main identified health effects. the nine original planetary boundaries and some of their health effects, both beneficial and harmful, are shown in alphabetical order. ocean acidification See climate change Potential to reduce quantity and quality of marine food, an important source of protein and micronutrients to humans. planetary boundaries do not identify health risks per se, but the argument of Earth system scientists is that if a sufficient number of boundaries are exceeded then profound effects for the Earth system will occur. the term \u201climits to growth\u201d was popularized by the best-selling book of that name. it became one of the most controversial and discussed publications of the 1970s. it warned that without radical reform, civilization faced collapse, perhaps by the middle of the current century. there are many other forms of pollution, local and regional, including novel entities ranging from endocrine disruptors [62] to radiation. this aspect has received some public health attention, including a special issue in the American Journal of Public Health [75] a clean energy transition might allow humanity to keep within its carbon budget. to ignore these issues is an imprudent violation of the precautionary principle. to ignore these issues is an imprudent violation of the precautionary principle. to ignore these issues is an imprudent violation of the precautionary principle. the european migrant and refugee crisis temporarily displaced consideration of the Paris agreement on climate change from the agenda of a European Union meeting [85]. the refugee crisis is itself arguably a consequence not only of climate change, but of other aspects of limits to growth (water scarcity, limits of social tolerance) the concept is of importance if Limits to Growth and Planetary Boundaries are valid. extreme interpretations in the other direction (i.e., that environmental determinants are irrelevant to human well-being) not only violate the precautionary principle but appear ideological. financially poor populations are vulnerable to adverse consequences of adverse environmental change. they are thus vulnerable to many adverse health effects, including impaired mental health, suicide, and other forms of self-harm, injuries, renal impairment, multifactorial poor health, and infectious diseases. the named groups and mechanisms are a small subset of the total number. the disproportionate risk of the poor to what McMichael called \u201cPlanetary Overload\u201d [25] was identified as a cause of \u201cenvironmental brinkmanship\u201d [87]. conventional proposals to lift the position of the poor generally involve more economic growth, as measured non-ecologically [105], with little recognition that without extensive decoupling economic growth puts civilization closer to harmful thresholds. a research network called Health-Earth was co-founded in 2014. it seeks to catalyse a powerful response by the wider health community. it was co-founded by eight individuals associated with interdisciplinary research groups from six countries and one UN University. health Hancock, Trevor Canada Public health, urban systems Jaakkola, Jouni Finland Environmental epidemiology, ethics Morse, Andy UK Climate impacts, infectious diseases Potter, John new
