{"summary": "multistage sampling was carried out, starting with four districts, followed by sequentially sampling two blocks. in each block, two sectors and two health sub-centers were selected. the case definition of suspected meningitis in disease surveillance was found to be difficult. development and field testing of syndromic reporting initially identified five syndromes of potential public health importance. the uniqueness of syndromic surveillance lay in its ability to detect outbreaks of diseases that do not fall into the current WHO case classifications. the reporting units are the existing government health units. reporting is carried out weekly on 12 syndromes. OMDSS has been merged with the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program. study setting Orissa is one of the least urbanized states in India. the rate of urbanization is only 14.97% (2001 census). the health indicators are poor, as compared to the other states of the country with poor infrastructure, lesser health staff, and fewer resources. four qualified researchers recruited for the field survey. study design and sampling A sample was selected using the multistage sampling method. 93.5% of the subjects were aware of the fact that deaths were captured in the system. only 17% could correctly answer the question on how to record a case as old or new, when given an instance of a case of measles with diarrhea, but no dehydration. 93.6% agreed that they followed the standard case definitions. 86.6% of the subjects enlisted more than 10 disease categories out of the 12 under surveillance. only 17% could correctly answer the question on how to record a case as old or new, when given an instance of a measles with diarrhea, but no dehydration. only 50% could correctly decide the priority disease to be recorded, when given an instance of a case of measles with diarrhea, but no dehydration. DISCUSSION Disease surveillance systems all over the world use three levels of data types. preclinical data, clinical pre-diagnostic data, and diagnostic data. a case definition for meningitis was the most difficult for case detection. training was given on the process of recording a priority disease. 17% of respondents committed errors in recording cases as new or old. a majority, 50%, could not prioritize the disease for surveillance recording. the first task is to differentiate natural (statistical) variability from \u2018pseudo-outbreaks\u2019 due to data entry or coding errors. many experts question the capacity of syndromic surveillance to provide an early outbreak detection, as there is a lack of precision in the data it generates. studies have shown that timeliness of reporting is identified as the system attribute most amenable to improvement. many electronic and automated innovations have been tried to improve timeliness. a simple act of reminding surveillance personnel through phone calls has proved to be the most tactical way of improving timeliness. syndromic surveillance has proven its utility as a reliable instrument in early detection of outbreaks. since the 1990s, syndromic surveillance has proven its utility as a reliable instrument in the early detection of outbreak. a case definition for meningitis was the most difficult for case detection (29.94%). a case definition for meningitis was the most difficult for case detection (29.94%). surveillance has shown to be an effective mechanism for early detection of the malarial outbreak, from the experience of the african continent. the case in point is Ethiopia, where weekly percentile cutoffs proved to be an efficient tool for the detection of a malarial outbreak. the quality of data is influenced by the clarity of surveillance forms, the quality of training, supervision of persons who completed the surveillance ms, and the care exercised in data management. a review of these facets of a surveillance system provides an indirect measure of the quality of data. a 2.3-fold increase in case reports should be made to improve the method to automated data transmission. only 69% of reporting units had sent the weekly diseases surveillance report on time. the pertinence of timeliness in public health surveillance systems has been stressed. completeness of notifiable infectious disease reporting in the united states varies from 9 to 99%. many researchers have tried to improve the completeness of the surveillance system through the Capture\u2014Recapture method. syndromic surveillance is dependent on the alarm thresholds. study looked at motivation for the study participants to be part of surveillance activity. the reasons given for participating were job responsibility and usefulness for the health system (25.28%) to be boosted. to be boosted."}
