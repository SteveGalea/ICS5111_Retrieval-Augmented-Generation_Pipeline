{"summary": "study aimed to determine gaps, challenges, and priorities for preventing emerging and re-emerging infections. the first method was a rapid assessment for the preparedness and response to emerging and re-emerging infections. the second method was a face-to-face round table meeting of participating teams for two days. a high number of internally displaced persons and refugees living in overcrowded and overburdened spaces has contributed to the emergence and reemergence of epidemic diseases in the region. the regional preparedness, response, and control efforts face major challenges such as poor vector surveillance capacities, lack of integrated vector management approaches, weak multidisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration. the risk of emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases has increased significantly in the past years. a high number of internally displaced persons and refugees living in overcrowded and overburdened spaces has contributed to the emergence and reemergence of epidemic diseases. the regional preparedness, response, and control efforts face major challenges such as poor vector surveillance capacities, lack of integrated vector management approaches, weak multidisciplinary and intersectoral collaboration. the first method was a rapid assessment for preparedness and response to the emerging and re-emerging infections in 4 countries of the region. the second method was a face-to-face round table meeting of the participating teams for two days. the participants presented their countries\u2019 profiles, findings, priorities, and gaps based on the countries\u2019 assessments. the organizing team invited director generals, senior surveillance officers, animal health officers, directors of the central public health Laboratories, director for communicable diseases, and FETP coordinators to participate in the round table meeting. experts gave an overview of the region and provided some information on the main known threats to the region. the countries\u2019 representatives presented their countries\u2019 profiles and findings of the rapid assessments. the questionnaire tackled the following areas: legislation and coordination (4 questions), biosafety and biosecurity (12 questions), surveillance and human resources (12 questions), case management and response (2 questions), infection control and prevention (7 questions), risk communication (4 questions), and laboratory capacity (4 questions). the questionnaire included yes, no, remarks and percentage for responses and a section for listing the priorities and gaps for urgent consideration. delegates and facilitators of all countries came up with areas of priority for immediate consideration and areas for short- or long-term consideration. special attention was given to biosafety, biosecurity, and biorisk management issues related to emerging and re-emerging infections. the surveillance system in Jordan reports weekly and monthly, but outbreaks are reported immediately. the frequency of reporting of surveillance sites in Iraq, Morocco, and Egypt is immediate and daily for notifiable diseases. all countries reported that their public health surveillance systems are linked with response units. a total of 2 out of 4 countries reported that they have a WHO-certified point of entry. Jordan and Egypt reported not having any WHO-certified point of entry. participants of the round table highlighted that the interdisciplinary coordination and communication within the health sector and throughout the board with other actors are weak. 3 countries confirmed that they have a biorisk management plan. they regularly conduct risk assessment of major health facilities. Morocco reported that they do not have a biorisk management plan. case management and response Only 2 countries reported that they have generic protocols for the treatment of emerging and re-emerging infections. all countries reported that they have updated protocols for the sample collection of the emerging and re-emerging infections. participants reported that they face multidrug-resistant infections in their countries. risk communication and involvement of media were identified to be weak. the public health laboratories are functioning in Iraq but with limited diagnostic kits and limited laboratory supplies. the accepted national and regional guidelines and standards while dealing with emerging and re-emerging infections Establish outbreak management teams to improve timely and effective response Develop and agree on the detailed SOPs for operational issues and challenges Strengthen the links with mass media and user-friendly social media Improve and strengthen public health surveillance systems. highlights by country The country-specific priorities and recommendations are presented in Textbox 1. commitment to improve available gaps Improve biorisk management (biosafety and biosecurity risk management) by a national plan implementation Strengthen infection control and prevention in hospitals Establishment of public health surveillance systems at the point of entries and improve the shipment of biological samples. the general recommendations by countries can be summarized as follows: Improve coordination, communication, and interaction among partners, stakeholders, and donors. they included improving the communication or building collaboration to improve the overall health of the country. the country-specific priorities and recommendations are presented in Textbox 1. any breach of the biorisk management plan and its related standard operating procedures Training of health care workers on biosafety and biosecurity and emerging and re-emerging infections Coordination meetings with the neighboring countries on the emerging and re-emerging infections."}
