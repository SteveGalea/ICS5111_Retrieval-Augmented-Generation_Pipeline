{"summary": "the toxicokinetics of cadmium depend on the form of cadmium, the dose, the time of exposure and the accumulation in the affected organ (5,6) cadmium can be observed in all organs of the body; however, the majority accumulates in the lungs, liver and kidney (7,8) the IL-1 and IL-10 cytokines were selected as they were significantly upregulated following treatment with 75 M CdCl2 after 24 h. the cells were grown in 10 ml minimum essential medium (A549) or F12K (A549) medium, containing 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 0.25 g/ml amphotericin B and 10% F. 1105 A549 lung cancer cells or 5104 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate. the cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 or 200 M CdCl2 in a final volume of 1 ml in triplicate wells. each cell line was treated with 0, 50, 100 or 150 M CdCl2 in triplicate flasks for various durations (0, 6, 12, 18 or 24 h the homogenate was transferred to an eppendorf tube and centrifuged at 12,740 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove the lysed cell membrane debris. the cell lysates were stored at 20\u00b0C for cytokine analysis. the protein standards and working reagents were prepared. penicillin/streptomycin antibiotic solution (100), fetal bovine serum (FBS), trypsin-EDTA solution (1X), amphotericin B (1,000), phosphate-buffered saline without calcium and magnesium, CdCl2, 25% glutaraldehyde and crystal violet were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) cells or 5104 normal MRC-9 lung cells were plated into each well of a 24-well tissue culture plate and allowed to stabilize overnight in a 5% CO2 incubator. the cells were treated with 0, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150 or 200 M CdCl2 in a final volume of 1 ml in triplicate wells. after incubation, the viability of the cells was measured. ELISA The human IL-1 and IL-10 ELISA kits were purchased from Ray Biotech Inc. and used for the quantitative measurement of the expression levels of the cytokines in human lung cells. viability of normal lung MRC-9 cells reduced by 6, 11, 11, 44, 55, 60 and 75%. viability of the A594 lung cancer cells decreased by 13, 36, 42, 58, 65, 76 and 81%. significant toxic effect of CdCl2 was observed at 25 M CdCl2 in the A549 cells. dCl2 for 6 h demonstrated the maximum expression levels of each cytokine. expression levels decreased with increasing concentration and duration. results clearly demonstrated the response of the A549 lung cancer cells to the toxic effect of CdCl2. expression levels of cytokines, IL-1 and IL-10, were measured by ELISA kits. viability of normal and cancerous lung cells exposed to various CdCl2 concentrations was reduced by 6, 11, 11, 44, 55, 60 and 75%. viability of normal and cancerous lung cells exposed to various CdCl2 concentrations was demonstrated to be dose-dependent. the cells were treated with 0, 50, 75, 100, 100, 125, 150, 175 or 200 M CdCl2 for 24 h and the viability was measured by a crystal violet assay. the median lethal dose of CdCl2 where 50% of the cells had died in the human (A) normal lung and (B) lung cancer cells. expression levels of (A) IL-1 and (B) IL-10 were determined following treatment (*P0.05, compared with the control). IL, interleukin. Discussion The widespread industrial usage of cadmium presents a health risk directly and indirectly to humans and other living organisms. 90% of inhaled cadmium particles are absorbed by lung tissue. it causes pulmonary damage, emphysema and lung cancer. cytokines, IL-1 (pro-inflammatory) and IL-10 (anti-inflammatory) in the cells. cells release pro-inflammatory cytokines during inflammation, to activate the cytokine network and the secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines (30,31) the higher expression of cytokines, which lead to inflammation, may be responsible for the later cytotoxic effects in the cells. this is supported by a previous study demonstrating that high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines due to cadmium exposure cause pathological conditions in a biological system. the cytokine levels of patients with cancer were compared with the normal cells treated with CdCl2. a similar observation was observed when the cytokine levels of patients with cancer were compared with the cytokine levels of normal individuals. the longer exposure duration led to the accumulation of cadmium inside of the cell, which in turn causes decreased cytokine levels leading to cell death. the cells demonstrated a differential expression of the cytokines in response to CdCl2."}
