{"summary": "HCoV-NL63 was discovered shortly after the emergence of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. it is prevalent worldwide, appearing with a seasonal distribution similar to that of other human coronaviruses. the clinical presentation may vary depending on the general health status of the patient. endocytic entry of virions was classified as clathrin dependent, clathrin independent, or caveolin independent. the early stages of HCoV-NL63 infection have been described by us and others (18\u201320) RESULTS HCoV-NL63 enters the cell via endocytosis. we studied the effect of ammonium chloride (NH4Cl) and bafilomycin A. cells were preincubated with NH4Cl (50 mM), bafilomycin A (100 nM), or control dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. apical washes were collected for virus replication analysis. HCoV-NL63 yield was determined using a quantitative real-time PCR. no inhibition was observed in HAE cultures. LLC-Mk2 cells were fixed after 10, 20, 30, or 40 min postinoculation (p.i.) with gradient-purified virus, stained with antibodies specific to HCoV-NL63 N protein and EEA1. a longer incubation was required to observe virus attachment and entry. HCoV-NL63 particles attach efficiently to the cell surface. however, only a proportion of virions colocalize with the heparan sulfate. at that point, there is no colocalization of virus particles and clathrin-coated pits. LLC-Mk2 cells were incubated at 32\u00b0C for 5 to 20 min with gradient-purified HCoV-NL63, fixed, immunostained, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. the results showed colocalization of intracellular virions entering the cell with clathrin. HCoV-NL63 colocalizes with clathrin but not caveolin. HCoV-NL63 colocalization with clathrin (A) or caveolin (B) was analyzed with confocal microscopy. cells mock incubated and stained with isotypic antibodies were used as a control. clathrin and dynamin are important for HCoV-NL63 entry. LLC-Mk2 cells were incubated with control DMSO (A), 10 M Pitstop 2 (B) or 10 M MiTMAB (C) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and inoculated with Alexa Fluor 488-labeled transferrin. cells were fixed and stained for actin (red) the cytotoxicity of the endocytosis inhibitors was tested with an XTT assay. cells were incubated with control DMSO, 10 M Pitstop 2 or 10 M MiTMAB for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. the assay was performed in triplicate, and average values are presented. 0 on the x axis indicate that the virus is inside the cell. for extracellular virions, the x value is 0. A similar experiment was conducted using HAE cultures. cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with the inhibitors described above. in-mediated endocytosis is the main entry route for HCoV-NL63. we incubated LLC-Mk2 cells with a given inhibitor at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. they were infected with HCoV-NL63 (TCID50 = 400 per ml) for 2 h at 32\u00b0C. the influence of the tested inhibitors on HCoV-NL63 infection was also analyzed in HAE cultures. cultures were preincubated with a given inhibitor (Pitstop 2, MiTMAB, nystatin, or control DMSO) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and infected with HCoV-NL63 at a TCID50 of 400 per ml for 2 h at 32\u00b0C. after that time, cultures were incubated with a fixed cells were immunostained with anti-NL63 nucleocapsid protein (green) and nuclei (blue) fixed cells were immunostained with anti-NL63 nucleocapsid protein (green) and nuclei (blue), and confocal images were collected. inhibition of TMPRSS2 with camostat hampers virus infection in HAE cultures. inhibition of TMPRSS2 with camostat has no effect on virus replication in LLC-Mk2 cells. HAE cultures were inoculated with control DMSO or 100 M camostat for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were fixed and immunostained for HCoV-NL63 particles (green), actin (red), and nuclei (blue) fixed cells were immunostained for HCoV-NL63 particles (green), actin (red), and nuclei (blue) the cytotoxicity of the endocytosis inhibitors was tested with an XTT assay. cells were incubated with DMSO, 10 M cytochalasin D, 1.5 M jasplakinolide, or 400 nM nocodazole for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. LLC-Mk2 cells were washed with 1 phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4). supernatant samples were collected for virus replication analysis. apical washes were collected for virus replication analysis. cytotoxicity of the tested inhibitors was measured with an XTT assay. data on the y axis represent viability of the treated cells compared to the untreated reference samples. HCoV-NL63 virus employs the ACE2 protein for cellular entry. heparan sulfate proteoglycans serve as attachment receptors (19). heparan sulfate proteoglycans serve as attachment receptors. heparan sulfate proteoglycans serve as attachment receptors. HCoV-NL63 binding to ACE2 triggers clathrin-mediated endocytosis. precooled LLC-Mk2 cells were incubated at 32\u00b0C for 40 min at 4\u00b0C. no colocalization with clathrin was observed after 0 min of incubation. cultures were incubated with gradient-purified HCoV-NL63 at 32\u00b0C for 2 h. the virus and the cellular proteins were immunostained and analyzed. HCoV-NL63 colocalizes with clathrin but not caveolin. LLC-Mk2 cells were incubated with control DMSO (A), 10 M Pitstop 2 (B) or 10 M MiTMAB (C) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were inoculated with purified HCoV-NL63 and incubated at 32\u00b0C for 1 h. LLC-Mk2 cells were inoculated with gradient-purified HCoV-NL63. virus endocytosis was analyzed using confocal microscopy. results showed that virus internalization was hampered in cells pretreated with clathrin and dynamin inhibitors compared to DMSO-treated cells. hAE cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with clathrin or dynamin inhibitors compared to control cells. cells were then inoculated with purified HCoV-NL63 and incubated for 45 min at 32\u00b0C. the cytotoxicity of the endocytosis inhibitors was tested with an XTT assay. cells were incubated with control DMSO, 10 M Pitstop 2 or 10 M MiTMAB for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. data on the y axis represent the viability of the treated cells. RT-qPCR virus replication at 120 h p.i. showed an 2-log decrease in virus progeny production in the presence of Pitstop 2 and MiTMAB compared to that in DMSO-treated cells. the influence of the tested inhibitors on HCoV-NL63 infection was also analyzed in HAE cultures. LLC-Mk2 cells were incubated with control DMSO (A), 5 g/ml nystatin (B), 10 M MiTMAB (C) or 10 M Pitstop 2 (D) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after 2 h of incubation at 32\u00b0C, virions that were not internalized were inactivated with acidic buffer (pH 3), and cells were incubated for 4 days at 32\u00b0C. cytotoxicity of the inhibitors was tested with an XTT assay. cells were incubated with 10 M Pitstop 2, 10 M MiTMAB, 5 g/ml nystatin, or DMSO. HCoV-NL63 replication in LLC-Mk2 cells was analyzed using RT-qPCR. virions that were not internalized were inactivated with acidic buffer. cells were inoculated with purified HCoV-NL63 and incubated at 32\u00b0C for 2 h. the microtubule inhibitor did not affect virus entry. no cytotoxicity was observed for the tested inhibitors. cells were incubated with DMSO, 10 M cytochalasin D, 1.5 M jasplakinolide, or 400 nM nocodazole. the role played by cathepsins and acidification of the microenvironment during transition of the HCoV-NL63 S protein to its fusogenic form remains unclear. to do this, we carried out experiments using chemical inhibitors of endosome acidification (ammonium chloride and bafilomycin A) both blocked virus infection in LLC-MK2 cells. HCoV-NL63 binding to ACE2 initiates recruitment of clathrin and subsequent formation of clathrin-coated pits. no colocalization of the virus with other markers (e.g., caveolin) was noted. inhibitors of clathrin completely blocked virus internalization, and the virus remained on the cell surface. inhibition of this protease did not hamper virus internalization into the cell. we believe that TMPRRS2 indeed is required for the virus-cell fusion, acting similarly to cathepsins, but it does not enable fusion on the cell surface. the study was approved by the Bioethical Committee of the Medical University of Silesia in Katowice, Poland. participants provided their written informed consent to participate in the study. human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were grown on plastic to generate passage 1 cells. 100 l of the culture medium (for LLC-Mk2) or 1 PBS (for HAE) with 30 l of the activated XTT solution was added to each well/culture insert. after 2 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, the solution was transferred onto a 96-well plate and the signal was measured at = 490 nm using a colorimeter. cell viability was set to 100%.
