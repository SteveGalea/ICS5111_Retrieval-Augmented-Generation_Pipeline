{"summary": "poliovirus infection causes massive rearrangement of intracellular membranes. double-membraned vesicles 200\u2013400 nm in diameter accumulating in the cytoplasm. it is thought that one function for membrane localization of viral RNA replication proteins is to promote their oligomerization. the formation and maturation of autophagosomes involves the stepwise acquisition of proteins from disparate cellular compartments. in mammalian cells, the formation and maturation of autophagosomes involves the stepwise acquisition of proteins from disparate cellular compartments. poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A induce the formation of vesicles that are biochemically and ultrastructurally similar to those formed in poliovirus-infected cells. poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A localize to the ER when expressed in isolation. this leads to the hypothesis that they are modified COPII vesicles, subverted from the anterograde transport pathway. the idea that poliovirus infection induces autophagosome formation is surprising in view of existing data that autophagy is an effective antimicrobial host response in many cases. the process of autophagy is thought to be destructive to herpes virus because mutant viruses fail to inhibit autophagy and other antiviral responses showed large decreases in yield. poliovirus RNA replication complexes colocalize with proteins of poliovirus RNA replication complexes. LC3 was expressed via DNA transfection as an amino-terminal fusion with green fluorescent protein (GFP) no colocalization with poliovirus 3A protein was seen when GFP was not fused to LC3. LC3, originally identified as a microtubule-associated protein [47], and LAMP1, a marker of late endosomes and lysosomes, do not colocalize. this process can be seen in Figure 2A, in which LC3 and LAMP1 were shown to colocalize almost completely in MCF-7 cells upon treatment with tamoxifen, a known inducer of autophagy. infections were with Mahoney type 1 poliovirus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 50 PFU/cell for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C. expression of poliovirus protein 2BC and 3A in isolation can induce the formation of double-membraned vesicles. expression of poliovirus protein 2BC alone has been shown to induce the formation of single-membraned vesicles in both mammalian cells and -infected cells, proteins 2BC and 3A were expressed singly or in combination in 293T cells in the presence of GFP\u2013LC3 and LAMP1. coexpression of 2BC and 3A caused GFP\u2013LC3 and LAMP1 to colocalize (Figure 3A), as was seen in cells infected with poliovirus. cells that were treated with 10 M tamoxifen in DMSO/EtOH or with DMSO/EtOH alone for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C were incubated with 100 M MDC, fixed, and visualized by deconvolution microscopy in the UV channel. cells were infected with poliovirus at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell for 0, 1.5, 3, or 4.5 h at 37 \u00b0C. CF-7 cells with a plasmid expresses a GFP-LC3 fusion protein were mock-infected or infected with poliovirus at an MOI of 50 PFU/cell for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C. deconvolution microscopy was used to visualize fluorescence from both the MDC and GFP fluorescent molecules. H1 HeLa cells were treated with 50 nM rapamycin in DMSO/EtOH or DMSO/EtOH alone for 3 h before infection with poliovirus as in (A) viral yields were determined by plaque assay in H1-HeLa cells and expressed as PFU/cell. RNA oligonucleotides were synthesized to target their mRNAs for destruction by RNA interference. the first possibility was that the RNAi-mediated reductions in the intracellular concentrations of Atg12p and LC3 protein reduced cell lysis and therefore lytic release of virus. links between autophagy and apoptosis have been reported. the relative abundance of Atg12p protein was determined by immunoblot. a second possibility for the greater reduction in extracellular than intracellular virus is that double-membraned structures with the cytoplasm provide a topologically reasonable mechanism for nonlytic release of cytoplasmic contents. plasmid expresses GFP-LC3 and subsequently infected with poliovirus for 5 h. arrowhead identifies apparently extracellular packets of cytosol. arrowhead identifies apparently extracellular packets of cytosol. 3A and other components of the poliovirus RNA replication complex localize [3] can recruit LC3. cells were transfected either with a plasmid that expresses a GFP-LC3 fusion protein or GFP alone as indicated. cells were infected with poliovirus, then fixed and stained using a monoclonal antibody to poliovirus 3A protein. 4.5 h postinfection, the LAMP1 and GFP\u2013LC3 signals had merged almost completely. the colocalization of GFP\u2013LC3 and LAMP1 characteristic of autophagosome formation was also seen in cells infected with either of two different serotypes of human rhinovirus. expression of poliovirus protein 2BC alone has been shown to induce the formation of single-membraned vesicles in both mammalian cells and S. cerevisiae. but expression of poliovirus 3A protein in isolation reduces the rate of ER-to-Golgi traffic and distends ER membranes. phagic Induction Induce Punctate MDC Staining. treatment of human breast tumor cells with tamoxifen caused accumulation of punctate structures that retained staining with MDC after fixation. similar punctate staining was observed in cells infected for 5 h with rhinovirus 14. if cells are subjected to a defined fixation protocol after staining with MDC, the dye can be removed from single-membraned, but not double-membraned, vesicles. no evidence of the punctate MDC staining expected of lysosomal membranes could be seen in uninfected cells. denine, a pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy [56], yield of intracellular virus was decreased. poliovirus yields were determined by plaque assay in H1-HeLa cells. the intracellular abundance of Atg12p and LC3 proteins could be reduced to 70% and 90% of their abundance in cells treated with control double-stranded small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) these reductions in Atg12p and LC3 protein concentration resulted in 3-fold and 4-fold reductions, respectively, in intracellular poliovirus yields. even stronger effects of the RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated reduction in autophagy proteins on viral yield were observed. cell numbers were determined and triplicate plates were infected with poliovirus at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell for the times indicated. the relative abundance of LC3 protein in the cells incubated with the control and LC3-targeted RNAi molecules was determined by immunoblot using antibodies against human. in poliovirus-infected cells, such blebs can contain LC3, and Figure 8D shows that they can also contain VP1, a viral capsid protein. cells were transfected with a plasmid that expresses GFP-LC3 and subsequently infected with poliovirus for 5 h. osomes can be observed in human cells whether they are treated with tamoxifen or infected with poliovirus or rhinovirus. we have employed a new criterion for autophagy, the colocalization of LC3 and LAMP1 to demonstrate that this intracellular rearrangement was observed in cells treated with tamoxifen or transfected with plasmids that express poliovirus proteins 2BC and 3A. vesicles in cytoplasm of infected cells are equine artirivirus [61], murine hepatitis virus [62], and SARS virus [63]. murine ES cell lines deficient for APG5 with murine hepatitis virus were shown to result in a large decrease in extracellular yield of this enveloped virus. the effect on intracellular viral particles or RNA was not reported. bacterial icsB gene was shown to be required to prevent autophagic degradation. this process is specifically induced by a bacterial protein, the product of the virG gene. poliovirus, rhinovirus 2, rhinovirus 14, equine encephalitis virus [65] and murine hepatitis virus [64]. double-membraned autophagosomes form either from ER membrane or de novo. the action of many gene products, including Atg5p and Atg12p, are required. the double-membraned topology makes the extracellular release of virions trapped in the cytosolic lumen topologically plausible. RNA replication complexes of a subgenomic Flock House virus RNA were experimentally redirected to the cytoplasmic surface of the ER of S. cerevisiae. the yield of replicated RNA actually increased. a larger effect on extracellular than intracellular virus yield was observed when the abundance of autophagy proteins Atg12p and LC3 was reduced by RNAi. newly synthesized virus was shown to emerge from only the apical surface [78]. that the egress of this virus did not correspond to a detectable breach in the monolayer argued that a nonlytic, and polarized exit route of unknown origin had been utilized. we suggest a possible mechanism for this nonlytic release of cytosolic viral particles via the formation of double-membraned vesicles. a mechanism to spread virus within tissues of infected hosts without cell lysis could provide an advantage to those positive-strand viruses that subvert constituents of the cellular pathway of autophagosome formation. poliovirus Mahoney type 1 was isolated following transfection with an infectious cDNA and propagated as previously described. plasmid, LC3B sequences were amplified by PCR from a human Lung Library. the LC3A coding region was then inserted into the EcoRI site of pEGFP-C3 (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States) the 293T cells, which express SV40 T antigen, were used to facilitate expression from the SV40 promoter. a fresh stock solution of 5 mM MDC was made in 1:1 DMSO/EtOH. at 1 h before fixation, fresh medium that contained either 10 M MDC in DMSO/EtOH or an equivalent volume of DMSO/EtOH was added to the cells. the cells were then fixed using a freshly made 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 10 min at room temperature.
