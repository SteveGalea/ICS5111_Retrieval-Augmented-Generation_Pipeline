{"summary": "ICU onset bacteraemic MRSA infection was significantly reduced from 1.94 (phase 1) to 0.9 (phase 2, p = 0.005) and 0.28 (phase 3, p = 0.021) per 1000-patient-days. Intensive care units (ICUs) are often considered as the most important reservoirs for dissemination of MRSA to patients throughout the entire hospital network. a series of control measures such as active surveillance cultures, contact isolation of colonized or infected cases, decolonization therapy, and antimicrobial stewardship programs have been met with variable degrees of success. the 20-bed ICU was located in ward C2 and C4 with a total of 3 single rooms. the single rooms were usually reserved for critically-ill patients with haematological malignancy, transplantation or smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. pre-ICU onset MRSA infection was defined as the MRSA infection diagnosed before or within 48 hours of ICU admission. ICU onset MRSA infection referred to the MRSA infection diagnosed after 48 hours of ICU admission. the infection control team advised healthcare workers in ICU on isolation and infection control precautions in cases of colonization and infection. incidence density of pre-ICU onset MRSA infection, ICU onset nonbacteraemic MRSA infection, and ICU onset bacteraemic MRSA infection were expressed as number per 1000-patient-days. phase 1 was defined as the period before ICU renovation (1 January 2002 to 31 March 2004); phase 2 was defined as the period after implementation of hand hygiene campaign (1 July 2006 to 30 June 2009) study was performed in queen Mary hospital, a 1500-bed tertiary referral university-affiliated teaching hospital with a 20-bed ICU managing patients aged 18 years or older from all clinical specialties. the single rooms were usually reserved for critically-ill patients with haematological malignancy, transplantation or smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis. pre-ICU onset MRSA infection was defined as the MRSA infection diagnosed before or within 48 hours of ICU admission. the infection control team advised healthcare workers in ICU on the isolation and infection control precautions in cases of colonization and infection. single room isolation with contact precautions including wearing gloves and gown during close patient care was recommended. the incidence density of pre-ICU onset MRSA infection, ICU onset nonbacteraemic MRSA infection, and ICU onset bacteraemic MRSA infection were expressed as number per 1000-patient-days and analyzed according to different phases. the incidence density of infection due to ESBL-producing organisms in ICU in different phases were used as controls. the occupancy rate in ICU ranged between 83.3% and 97.3%. the nursing manpower was maintained at a ratio of 1 nurse to 1 patient at day time and 1 nurse to 2 patients at night shift. spectrum antibiotics include cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin; fluoroquinolones include ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin, and moxifloxacin; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. in phase 1, 82 patients with ICU onset MRSA infection were managed in open cubicles with cohort nursing. 49 and 23 MRSA cases were managed in single rooms and managed under contact precautions respectively. unobtrusive hand hygiene observation of at least 200 opportunities per assessment was performed in ICU after the implementation of hand hygiene campaign. ESBL-producing organisms includes E. coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. both the level change and trend change of the incidence density of ICU onset infections due to MRSA and ESBL-producing organisms had no significant difference. change in incidence density of ICU onset infection due to MRSA and ESBL-producing organisms from interrupted time-series with segmented regression analysis. pre-SARS period is defined as the time between 2002 to 2003 1Q and post-SARS period is defined as the time between 2003 2Q to 2009 2Q. ICU, adult intensive care unit; broad-spectrum antibiotics include cefepime, ceftazidime, and cefoperazone-sulbactam, piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, imipenem-cilastatin; fluoroquinolones, include ciprofloxacin, and moxifloxacin; methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. one-hundred and fifty-four (46%) out of 333 cases were found to have ICU onset MRSA infection. the median age (range) was 68 (19-90) years. initial sites of positive MRSA cultures were from the lower respiratory tract (82, 53%), bloodstream (48, 31%), skin and soft tissue (13, 8%), intravenous catheter (7, 5%), peritoneum (3, 2%), and urine (1, 1%). CU onset nonbacteraemic MRSA infection and ICU onset bacteraemic MRSA infection from phase 1 to 3 were not observed in the ICU onset infection due to ESBL-producing organisms. both the level change and trend change of the incidence density of ICU onset infections due to MRSA and ESBL-producing organisms had no significant difference across different phases during the study period. Pre-SARS period is defined as the time between 2002 1Q to 2003 1Q and post-SARS period is defined as the time between 2003 2Q to 2009 2Q. change in incidence density of ICU onset infection due to MRSA and ESBL-producing organisms. the incidence density of ICU onset MRSA infection had a significant change in level and trend before and after SARS. this finding illustrates an important principle that compliance with infection control practices by healthcare workers is determined by the perception of staff that their own personal safety may be threatened if such measures are not followed. study of literature on the single room isolation and/or hand hygiene practice was promoted which resulted in a sustained improvement in the compliance rate of over 60% across all ranks of healthcare workers. study of 2 teaching hospitals (18-bed for hospital A & 10-bed for hospital B), London, UK Phase 1 (6-month) all MRSA-positive patients were not moved or cohort nursed Phase 2 (7-12 month) admission and weekly screening for MRSA was significantly lower in single room (1.3 per 1000-patient-days) than bay room (4.1 per 1000-patient-days) placement in single room may reduce MRSA cross-transmission in the institution where MRSA is not hyperendemic Gastmeier P et al (2004) [4] Questionnaire surveillance to 212 ICUs participating in KISS. MRSA patients with mupirocin nasal ointment No significant reduction in MRSA colonization and infection after intervention The sample size was underpower to estimate the difference Note. previous studies demonstrated that the rate of MRSA acquisition could be significantly reduced by promotion of hand hygiene practice even when single room isolation was not available. in the absence of antibiotic stewardship program in ICU, the consumption of broad-spectrum antibiotics and fluoroquinolones gradually increased from phase 1 to 3. the incidence of community-acquired infection due to ESBL-producing E. coli and Klebsiella species increased significantly in our locality [23]. the CC8/SCCmec III/IIIA had decreased from 81.3% before year 2000 to 26.5% in year 2006 to 2008. the CC45/SCCmec IV/V clone had increased from 16.6% to 42.6% in the corresponding period. it may be one of the reasons why the pre-ICU onset MRSA infection was significantly increased from phase 2 to 3."}
