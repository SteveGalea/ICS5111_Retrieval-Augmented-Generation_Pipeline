{"summary": "primary immunodeficiency disorders (PIDs) are monogenic defects affecting the innate and/or adaptive immune systems. patients at increased risk of a wide range of manifestations including autoimmunity, immune dysregulation, and malignancies. but infectious complications are the commonest (2\u20134). secondary immunodeficiencies (drug induced, HIV induced, and immunodeficiency associated with metabolic disorders, etc.) were ruled out by obtaining a detailed history and by performing appropriate testing when these disorders were suspected. multiplex real-time reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) Fast-Track Diagnostics (FTD) Respiratory Pathogen 21 Assay (Fast-Track Diagnostics Ltd., Sliema, Malta) was performed on lightCycler 480 RT-PCR thermocycler (Roche, meylan, France) to detect viruses. these include influenza A (Flu A), influenza A subtype H1N1 (H1N1), human Rhinovirus CMV, EBV, enterovirus, HAdV, and HHV-6 detection were performed on serum, stool/colonic, respiratory or CSF samples. the presence of poliovirus RNA in clinical samples was confirmed by one-step reverse transcription-PCR, followed by a direct sequencing of PCR products. diagnosis of herpes simplex virus (HSV) keratitis and stomatitis, warts caused by human papilloma virus (HPV), varicella-zoster virus (VZV) and molluscum contagiosum infections was based on clinical evaluation. RT-PCRs were performed on 10 l of nucleic acid by using LightCycler 480 RT-PCR thermocycler (Roche, Meylan, France) a 200 mg aliquot was suspended in 1 ml of nuclease-free water or 1 ml of stool transport and recovery buffer (Roche, meylan, France) the presence of poliovirus RNA in clinical samples was confirmed by one-step reverse transcription-PCR. the presence of poliovirus RNA in clinical samples was confirmed by one-step reverse transcription-PCR followed by a direct sequencing of PCR products. p 0.05 was used as the cut-off level for statistical significance. viral infections affected 226 patients (82.4%), and viral infections affected 87 patients. there was a statistically significant association between viral infections and PID category. there was no statistically significant association between viral infections and gender. a patient with severe combined immunodeficiency presented with myocarditis caused by poliovirus type 2. two patients had prolonged excretion of poliovirus type 1 in the stool. most common presentation was viremia (28.8%) followed by pneumonia (28.2%) and skin infections (17.6%) deficiency (5) CMV (2) Viremia (1), Retinitis (1), Pneumonia (1) EBV (1) Viremia HHV-6 (1) Viremia Rhinovirus (1) Pneumonia Poliovirus-2 (1) Myocarditis Adenovirus (1) Viremia and liver failure RAG2 deficiency (4) EBV (3) Viremia (3), Meningitis (1) CMV (2) Viremia (2), Pneumonia (1) Molluscum contagiosum (2) enteritis (2) norovirus (2) Enteritis (2) Molluscum contagiosum (1) Molluscum contagiosum Rhinovirus (1) Pneumonia HHV-6 (1) Parainfluenza (2) Viremia and meningitis Pneumonia (2) ZAP70 deficiency (1) EBV (1) Viremia Rhinovirus (1) Pneumonia CMV (1) Pneumonia IKBKB deficiency (1) Adenovirus (1) Viremia Parainfluenza (1) P Viremia (1), Viremia (1), Retinitis (1) STAT3 deficiency (2) H1N1 (1) Pneumonia VZV (1) Chickenpox STAT5B deficiency (2) Rhinovirus (2) Pneumonia Adenovirus (2) Viremia EBV (2) Viremia RMRP deficiency (1) CMV (1) Pneumonia HPV (1) Warts Immunodeficiency with centromeric instability and facial anomalies (2) Sapovirus % Viremia 28.8 CMV (19) Adenovirus (12) EBV (10) Enteroviruses (6) HHV-6 (2) Pneumonia 28.2 CMV (18) Rhinovirus (9) Parainfluenza(5) Adenovirus (4) H1N1 (3) Coronavirus (2) RSV (2) EBV (2) Enterovirus (1) Skin infections 17.6 HPV (11) VZV (10) Molluscum contagiosum (9) Gastrointestinal infections 9.4 Norovirus there were 80 deaths (29%) among the registered patients, 8 of them (10%) were caused by viral infections as follows: CMV pneumonia (2 patients), enterovirus sepsis (1 patient), RSV pneumonia (1 patient), poliovirus-2 myocarditis (1 patient), and adenovirus sepsis (3 patients, 1 complicated by liver failure. molluscum contagiosum is a major regulator of the actin cytoskeleton that is critical for cell migration through collagen-dense tissue. the presented cohort of patients are characterized by the high frequency of combined immunodeficiencies which are more severe with a higher predisposition to viral infections. with RAG1 deficiency developed OPV related complication (i.e., myocarditis) two more patients with CID had prolonged excretion of poliovirus type 1 in the stool. this could be established by documenting the number of admissions to the intensive care unit, the number of admissions to the hospital, and the length of stay. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
