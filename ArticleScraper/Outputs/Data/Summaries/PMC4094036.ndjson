{"summary": "adolescent from Budapest, Hungary, wanted to study medicine. he was frustrated by the gaps in the scientific basis of medicine in the 1940s. he advised me to study organic chemistry and biochemistry and apply what I have learned to biomedical research. b was a gifted biochemist, whose contributions included the purification and crystallization of malic and lactic dehydrogenases and the discoveries of diaphorase and the muscle protein actin (2). after the collapse of the Hungarian uprising against the Soviet oppression in 1956, I fled to the west, together with 200,000 Hungarians. methylmalonyl isomerase is a branched chain compound that converts methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A, its straight chain isomer. this enzyme converts methylmalonyl coenzyme A, a branched chain compound, to succinyl coenzyme A, its straight chain isomer. vitamin B12 coenzyme in methylmalonyl isomerase was found in our sheep kidney enzyme. of the three types of coenzymes, only two, dimethylbenzimidazolylcobamide and benzimidazolylcobamide, appeared to fully activate the enzyme (7). this happened because, unexpectedly, I became involved in the initial deciphering of the genetic code. el et al. (10) described the preparation of random copolynucleotides. the five articles reported the correct nucleotide compositions of codons. a short section of my thesis was based on the treatment of synthetic polyribonucleotides with nitrous acid. this revealed that the purine nucleotide I (inosinate) has the same coding properties as guanylate. the ribosomal fraction (streptomycin-sensitive or streptomycin-resistant) determined whether the mixture was sensitive or resistant to streptomycin (12). several other antibiotics also impaired ribosome activity (15). at the time, the pasteur Institute was among the prime movers of progress in molecular biology. elongation factor EF-Ts were identified by Lucas-Lenard and Lipmann (18) elongation factor EF-Ts appeared to be unstable after purification. the thermophilic microorganism Bacillus stearothermophilus turned out to be a good choice. g. 1.4.1 copolymer of adenylic and uridylic acids are almost inactive at 37 \u00b0C in an E. coli system (20). g. 1.4.1 copolymer of adenylic and uridylic acids are almost inactive at 37 \u00b0C in an E. coli system (20). EF-Tu can form a ternary complex with each aminoacyl-tRNA involved in chain elongation. it was known that the chain initiator in E. coli is fMet-tRNAf synthesized by formylation of Met-tRNAf. it was also known that as initiator codons in E. coli, GUG and AUG specify fMet-tRNAf. equimolar amounts of EF-Tu, Phe-tRNA, and GMPPCP were bound to the ribosome, but no dipeptide was formed. fMet-tRNAf is required for the translation of bacteriophage f2 RNA in an E. coli extract. fMet-tRNAf is the only aminoacyl-tRNA present in a 70 S complex. in the absence of fMet-tRNAf, only a single ribosome was attached to the f2 RNA molecule. f2 RNA was protected against nuclease action by the attached ribosome. a single ribosome was bound to f2 RNA in the presence of fMet-tRNAf. an aliquot of the IC was converted into a pre-translocation complex. in the POC, the fMet-Ala-tRNA is bound at the A-site of the ribosome. each ribosomef2 RNA fragment complex was suspended in a reaction mixture. the oligopeptides from the POC had a C-terminal Thr residue (corresponding to -UUUACU), whereas those from the IC and PRC had C-terminal Phe residues (corresponding to -UUU) poly(U)-promoted formation of polyphenylalanine from Phe-tRNA. acetyl-Phe-tRNA served as an analog of the natural chain initiator fMet-tRNAf. EF-Tu can form a ternary complex with each aminoacyl-tRNA involved in chain elongation. equimolar amounts of EF-Tu, Phe-tRNA, and GMPPCP were bound to the ribosome, but no dipeptide was formed. in 1966, Eisenstadt and I proved that fMet-tRNAf is required for the translation of bacteriophage f. chain initiator codons AUG and GUG specify internal amino acid residues. it was known that the region of mRNA that is bound to ribosomes is protected against cleavage by nucleases. the intermediates in the assembly of a peptide chain initiation complex were reported. a single ribosome was bound to bacteriophage f2 RNA in the presence of fMet-tRNAf under conditions in which it is bound to the coat protein initiation site (initiation complex) an aliquot of the IC was converted into a pre-translocation complex (PRC) in a reaction with EF-Tu, GTP, and Ala-tRNA. each of the three isolated ribosomef2 RNA complexes was examined in two ways. first, the f2 RNA fragments were isolated from each, and the nucleotide sequences at the 3\u2032-terminal region of the fragments were determined. each ribosomef2 RNA fragment complex was suspended in a reaction mixture including labeled amino acids. elongation factors were designated in the now accepted way: EF-Ts, EF-G, and EF-Tu. the acetyl-Phe-tRNA served as an analog of the natural chain initiator fMet-tRNAf. the molar ratio of GTP to Phe-tRNA was 1:1. the chain initiator in E. coli is fMet-tRNAf synthesized by formylation of Met-tRNAf. it was also known that as initiator codons in E. coli, GUG and AUG specify fMet-tRNAf; as codons for internal amino acid residues, GUG stands for Val-tRNA, and AUG stands for Met-tRNAm. equimolar amounts of EF-Tu, Phe-tRNA, and GMPPCP were bound to the ribosome, but no dipeptide was formed. in 1966, Eisenstadt and I proved that fMet-tRNAf is required for the translation of bacteriophage f2 RNA in an E. coli extract. f is the only aminoacyl-tRNA present in a 70 S complex containing f2 RNA. in the absence of fMet-tRNAf, only a single ribosome was attached to the f2 RNA molecule. in the presence of fMet-tRNAf, only a single ribosome was attached to the f2 molecule. a single ribosome was bound to f2 RNA in the presence of fMet-tRNAf. an aliquot of the IC was converted into a pre-translocation complex. in the POC, the fMet-Ala-tRNA is bound at the A-site of the ribosome, and the A-site is vacant. oligopeptides from the POC had a C-terminal Thr residue (corresponding to -UUUACU), whereas those from the IC and PRC had C-terminal Phe residues (corresponding to -UUU) the conclusions are based on the difference between the 3\u2032 ends of the mRNA fragments protected against RNase cleavage in the IC, PRC, and POC. the acetyl-Phe-tRNA served as an analog of the natural chain initiator fMet-tRNAf. ono et al. established that EF-Tu and fMet-tRNAf do not form a complex with either Met-tRNAf or fMet-tRNAf. fMet-tRNAf is required for the translation of bacteriophage f2 RNA in an E. coli extract. the chain initiator codons AUG and GUG specify internal amino acid residues. Kondo et al. (30) developed a procedure for isolating a chain initiation signal containing segments of mRNA. it was known that the region of mRNA that is bound to ribosomes is protected against cleavage by nucleases. bacteriophage R17 RNA presented its complete sequence. we presented the initiation signal (33) containing the segment of f2 RNA. movement of the ribosome along mRNA during peptide chain elongation is triggered by EF-G and GTP. each ribosomef2 RNA complex was examined in two ways. first, the f2 RNA fragments were isolated from each. nucleotide sequences at the 3\u2032-terminal region were determined. each ribosomef2 RNA fragment complex was suspended in a reaction mixture. two tRNASer species in E. coli respond to codons with entirely unrelated nucleotide sequences. the same enzyme recognized the two tRNASer species with entirely unrelated anticodons. the anticodon cannot be the site of specific recognition for ser-tRNA synthetase. second genetic code deals with the recognition of tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. it deals with the recognition of tRNA by aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase. it is different from the genetic code that concerns the translation of codons in mRNA into amino acids. reovirus genomic double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) degraded reovirus mRNA faster than an extract from control cells (S30C) the addition of reovirus dsRNA or the synthetic dsRNA poly(I)poly(C) accelerated the degradation of reovirus mRNA in S30INT but not in S30C. in 1978, Ratner et al. (47) established that the incubation of dsRNA with S30INT triggered the formation of a small thermostable molecule that activated the latent endonucleaseINT (i.e. RNase L) the discovery of this heat-stable compound inhibiting cell-free protein synthesis and its identification as 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate (2\u20135A) triggered an increase in endonuclease activity two pathways by which dsRNA inhibits protein synthesis are described. the first (pathway a) is described in some detail at the end of the previous paragraph. the second (pathway b) is a purified, IFN-induced protein kinase (53) that, if activated by dsRNA and ATP, will phosphorylate and thereby inactivate the small subunit of the peptide chain initiation factor eIF-2. IFN-treated Ehrlich ascites tumor cells contain at least two distinct 2\u20135A synthetases translated from at least two distinct mRNAs. the bulk of the progress in understanding the 2\u20135A RNase L system was generated in the laboratory of R. H. Silverman and his collaborators. in vitro translation of mRNA from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells treated with IFN resulted in 5-fold more of a Mr 14,500 protein than translation of mRNA from control cells. 7.5-fold more of the same protein was found in an extract from IFN-treated cells than in that from control cells. this revealed that IFN can induce particular proteins, and this may be due to increasing the level of particular mRNAs. ine IFN species (one type and two types) were reported by Taira et al. (64) in the same issue of Science as those of the first N-terminal sequences of human lymphoblastoid IFN and human fibroblast IFN. they demonstrated that even within the same cells, the IFN system can discriminate between the expression of the SV40 T-antigen from an infecting viral genome (which it inhibits) the resulting labeled cDNA was used to identify IFN-inducible mRNAs. the first one of these novel mRNAs served as the starting material for a new project concerning the IFN-inducible proteins of the multifunctional p200 protein family. ascites tumor cells treated with IFN resulted in 5-fold more of a Mr 14,500 protein than translation of mRNA from control cells. 7.5-fold more of the same protein was found in an extract from IFN-treated cells than in that from control cells. this revealed that IFN can induce particular proteins, and this may be due to increasing the level of particular mRNAs. in vitro translation of mRNA from Ehrlich ascites tumor cells treated with IFN resulted in 5-fold more of a Mr 14,500 protein than translation of mRNA from control cells. 7.5-fold more of the same protein was found in an extract from IFN-treated cells than in that from control cells. the resulting labeled cDNA was used to identify IFN-inducible mRNAs. the first one of these novel mRNAs served as the starting material for a new project concerning the IFN-inducible proteins of the multifunctional p200 family protein family. murine cDNA clone (Ifi202 cDNA) encoded 202 mRNA (70) the gene encoding this mRNA was mapped to chromosome 1. the first such murine cDNA clone (Ifi202 cDNA) encoded 202 mRNA (70) the human IFI200 (or HIN) gene cluster was discovered by Trapani et al. (78) in 1992. it also contains the MNDA, AIM2, and IFIX genes. the evolution of the p200 family genes involved repeated gene duplications. p202 appears to be associated with chromatin. p202 binds dsDNA in vitro. overexpression of p202 inhibits growth (82) the human adenovirus 5-encoded protein promotes cell proliferation. it overcomes the p202-mediated inhibition of cell growth. this is the consequence of alleviation of a p202-mediated inhibition of the activity of the E2F-1 transcription factor. p202b levels in murine embryonic fibroblasts from the knock-out mice were approximately as high as those of p202a and p202b in wild-type mice. this suggests dosage compensation at post-transcriptional levels. the latter might account for the apparent lack of phenotype of the knock-out mice. two novel murine p202 genes are close homologs of the first described Ifi202 gene. the three 202 genes colocalize to chromosome 1. the three 202 genes colocalize to chromosome 1. p202 antagonizes the generation of inflammasomes by AIM2. the p202 HIN2 domain binds the AIM2 HIN2 domain, thereby inhibiting the clustering of AIM2 on dsDNA (95) p202 gene was knocked out in 1999 by Wang et al. p202 is a p200 family protein in mice that has a human counterpart with the same name. p202 antagonizes the generation of inflammasomes by AIM2. this inhibits the clustering of AIM2 on dsDNA (95) 202 genes are close homologs of the first described Ifi202 gene. the three 202 genes colocalize to chromosome 1. p202b is IFN-inducible and differs from Ifi202a in 7 amino acids. p204 antagonizes the generation of inflammasomes by AIM2. the p202 HIN2 domain binds the AIM2 HIN2 domain, thereby inhibiting the clustering of AIM2 on dsDNA (95). p204 was found to be nucleolar and nucleoplasmic in cultured murine cells. increased p204 level during differentiation was a consequence of binding of myoD, myogenin, and E12/E47 transcription factors. overexpression of p204 in the C2C12 myoblasts by antisense RNA inhibited the fusion in differentiation medium (100) p204 bound to Id proteins, blocked their binding to bHLH transcription factors. p204 triggered to differentiate to beating cardiac myocyte-type cells by dimethyl sulfoxide (104). ectopic p204 induced differentiation, whereas ectopic 204 antisense RNA inhibited the differentiation induced by dimethyl sulfoxide. p204 overcame inhibition of synergistic activity of Gata4 and Nkx2.5. expression of p204 in several organs of Mice does not depend on IFN. p204 is translocated to the cytoplasm during skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation. K-ras and H-ras proteins cycle between activated and inactivated forms. Ras proteins control signaling pathways regulating transcription, translation, cell growth, cell shape, cell shape, apoptosis, senescence, and malignant transformation. oncogenic ras expression triggered the translocation of p204 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, the compartment in which Ras is located. p204 inhibited the anchorage-independent proliferation of cells expressing Ras oncoprotein and also blocked the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. p204 was shown by Liu et al. (97) to inhibit ribosomal RNA synthesis. p204 bound the ribosomal RNA-specific transcription factor UBF1. p204 bound the three pocket proteins pRb, p107, and p130 (98). p204 bound the three pocket proteins pRb, p130, and p130. p204 bound to Id proteins blocked binding to bHLH transcription factors. ectopic p204 induced differentiation, whereas ectopic 204 antisense RNA inhibited differentiation induced by dimethyl sulfoxide. p204 contains a nuclear export signal and was partially translocated to the cytoplasm during differentiation. endogenous or ectopic Id protein inhibited differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells to beating cardiac myocyte-type cells. p204 overcame inhibition of transcription factor activity by Id proteins as a consequence of (a) binding and sequestering Id proteins. p204 is translocated to the cytoplasm during skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation. most of p204 is cytoplasmic in mouse heart and in isolated cardiac myocytes. p204 bound endogenous or ectopic K-Ras and its sister protein, H-Ras, in cell lysates. the three effectors first identified were Raf-1 (a serine/threonine kinase), PI3K, and Ral-GDS, a GDP-GTP exchange factor for Ral proteins. purified p204 bound to purified H-Ras- or K-Ras-GTP; inhibited their cleavage to Ras-GDP by Ras GTPase-activating protein; and inhibited the binding to H-Ra p204 inhibits ribosomal RNA Synthesis p204 was found to be nucleolar and nucleoplasmic in cultured murine cells (96) p204 bound UBF1 and it inhibited binding of UBF1 to the regulatory region of the ribosomal DNA genes (97). p204 bound the three pocket proteins pRb, p107, and p130 (98). p204 is a negative feedback inhibitor of Ras activity. p204 levels were highest in the heart, skeletal muscle, and kidney. in cultured mice, p204 was nucleoplasmic. p204 became phosphorylated, and the bulk of it appeared in the cytoplasm. p204 expression was synergistically transactivated by the cardiac Gata4, Nkx2.5, and Tbx5 transcription factors. the regulatory region of the Ifi204 gene in P19 cells and in cultured newborn rat cardiac myocytes revealed p204 expression was synergistically transactivated by the cardiac Gata4 and Nkx2.5 transcription factors. p204 overcame inhibition of transcription factor activity by Id proteins. expression of p204 in several organs of Mice does not depend on IFN. p204 is translocated to the cytoplasm during skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation. purified p204 bound endogenous or ectopic K-Ras and its sister protein, H-Ras, in cell lysates. p204 bound endogenous or ectopic K-Ras and its sister protein, H-Ras, in vitro. p204 inhibited the anchorage-independent proliferation of cells expressing Ras oncoprotein. p204 inhibited the rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. p204 can serve as a negative feedback inhibitor of Ras activity. p204 binds pRb and increases the transcriptional activity of the Cbfa1 transcription factor involved in osteoblast differentiation. p204 was found to be nucleolar and nucleoplasmic in cultured murine cells. in the nucleoli and also in a cell-free system, p204 was shown to inhibit ribosomal RNA synthesis. overexpression of p204 in the C2C12 myoblasts by antisense RNA inhibited the fusion in differentiation medium (100). p204 bound to Id proteins blocked their binding to bHLH transcription factors (101, 102) and overcame their inhibition of bHLH transcription factor activity and muscle differentiation. p204 expression was synergistically transactivated by the cardiac Gata4, Nkx2.5, and Tbx5 transcription factors. p204 contains a nuclear export signal and was partially translocated to the cytoplasm during differentiation. p204 inhibited differentiation of P19 embryonal carcinoma stem cells to beating cardiac myocyte-type cells. expression of p204 in several Organs of Mice does not depend on IFN. p204 is translocated to the cytoplasm during skeletal and cardiac muscle differentiation. p204 bound endogenous or ectopic K-Ras and its sister protein, H-Ras. Ras proteins control signaling pathways regulating transcription, translation, cell growth, cell shape, cell shape, apoptosis, senescence, and malignant transformation. they are persistently activated because, unlike wild-type Ras proteins, they are unable to promote the cleavage of the bound GTP to GDP. Ras oncoprotein and wild-type Ras-GTP were reported to increase the expression of the Egr-1 transcription factor (110, 111) the probable significance of p204 as a tumor suppressor was revealed. p204 can serve as a negative feedback inhibitor of Ras activity. the knock-out of a murine p202 gene (p202a) was reported (91) but it turned out that p202a has an active sister gene (p202b) that can substitute for it. further exploration of the functions of the multifunctional p202 and p204 proteins could be facilitated by generating mice in which p202 or p204 formation could be inhibited. a course for first-year medical students volunteered to take the course. it was a demanding set of lectures to learn from and also to prepare. thank my colleagues for advice and help during my close to 50 years at Yale."}
