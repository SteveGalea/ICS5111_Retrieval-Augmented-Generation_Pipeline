{"summary": "mRNAseq leaves out the nonpolyadenylated [poly(A)] fraction of the mammalian transcriptome. mRNAseq leaves out the nonpolyadenylated [poly(A)] fraction of the mammalian transcriptome, which includes many noncoding RNAs. splicing is indicated as a contributing factor to the delay between pre-mRNA and mRNA production (6, 7) splicing is indicated as a contributing factor to the delay between pre-mRNA and mRNA production (6, 7) splicing is indicated as a contributing factor to the delay between pre-mRNA and mRNA production (6, 7) ncRNAs and nascent pre-mRNAs performed total RNAseq analysis of the same HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cell samples as those previously used for mRNAseq analysis. we identified much broader (about 8-fold-greater) host transcriptional changes at 12 hpi by Total RNAseq but not mRNAseq. HIV-1 strain LAI (catalog no. 2522) was obtained from the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (Germantown, MD) and propagated in SUP-T1 cells. titers reached 107 infectious units per ml. the infectious doses in both infections were optimized to achieve 100% infected cells at 24 hpi with 50% cell viability as measured by trypan blue exclusion assay. we first infected 1 106 SUP-T1 cells with HIV-1 LAI at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h. allantoic fluids from multiple eggs were pooled, clarified by centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at 70\u00b0C. all research with avian viruses was conducted under biosafety level 3 containment. ribosomal sequences to remove potential rRNA sequences using the gapped aligner software Bowtie (17) we then mapped the remaining unmapped reads to the HIV genome using the gapped aligner software TopHat (18. to quantify transcript expression, we mapped reads that remained unmapped to the human reference genome. all newly assembled transcripts were checked against the known annotations. only those assembled transcripts with the class code \u201cu\u201d were added into the combined known annotations as predicted novel transcripts. qPCR was run on an ABI Prism. expression changes of a set of 46 host genes were quantified using qPCR. the results were identical to those derived from the GAPDH-controlled experiment. the list of genes differentially expressed at 12 hpi was too small. a similar analysis was done for the list of lncRNAs that were not differentially expressed during HIV-1 infection. three lncRNA categories were excluded from the analysis. the most significant P value among all functions within each function group was defined as the P value for the function group. these function groups were further filtered if the genes in a function group were mostly covered by more-significant (smaller P value) function groups. similar summarization and filtering process was done for enriched canonical pathways. cmap is a collection of genome-wide transcriptional data from cultured human cells treated with 1,309 different compounds. a high positive connectivity score indicates that the corresponding compound reversed the expression of the query signature. the bottom-ranked instance (i.e., a score of +1) is said to be the most positively connected with the query signature. we used 500 most upregulated and 500 most downregulated genes at 12 hpi for a query signature. we manually queried NCBI GEO data sets related to HIV infection and/or CD4+ T cells. for each gene module, the predictor variables were a set of candidate predicators/regulators. the response variable was the median expression changes of genes for each condition. in the case of 10 identified TFs as candidate regulators, we fitted a linear regression model with the elastic net penalty. q data from this publication have been submitted to NCBI's GEO database. infection of the human CD4+ T cell line SUP-T1 with HIV-1 strain LAI, cell and virus propagation, and sample collection for RNAseq were described in reference 1. an independent time course of infections of SUP-T1 with HIV-1 LAI was carried out as described in reference 14. infected cells were visualized by immunofluorescence assay with rabbit HIV-1SF2 p24 antiserum. allantoic fluids from multiple eggs were pooled, clarified by centrifugation, aliquoted, and stored at 70\u00b0C. rRNAs were depleted using the RiboMinus human/mouse transcriptome isolation kit. cDNA synthesis was primed using random hexamers. read mapping and differential expression analysis was carried out as described in reference 1. mRNAseq data were acquired using the exact same samples as reported in reference 1. we combined a published catalog of human long noncoding RNAs (21) with a reference human annotation recently released by the ENCODE project. independent of these known annotations, we reconstructed transcripts in each sample, using Cufflinks (22) based on reads mapped to the human genome. only those assembled transcripts with the class code \u201cu\u201d were added into the combined known annotations as predicted novel transcripts. cDNA was reverse transcribed using the QuantiTect reverse transcription kit. PCR was run on an ABI Prism 7900HT sequence detection system. the relative change in transcript abundance was calculated using the CT method. a hypergeometric test was used to test if the binding sites of a TF were enriched in the promoters of a list of differentially expressed genes. a similar analysis was done for the list of lncRNAs that were not differentially expressed during HIV-1 infection. d functions from IPA analysis were custom processed to summarize redundant entries. a similarity measurement was defined as the ratio between the number of overlapping genes and the total number of genes in one of two functions with a smaller number of genes. the corresponding distance was defined as 1 minus the calculated similarity measure. the ranked list was analyzed using the GseaPreranked tool. for each lncRNA differentially expressed at 12 hpi, we ranked all other genes by their correlation coefficients with the lncRNA of interest. the bottom-ranked instance (i.e., a score of 1) is the most negatively connected with the query signature. for each compound, cmap calculates a measure of the enrichment of its instances in either end of the order list of all instances in cmap and a permutation P value. to derive predictive models, we used a machine learning procedure called \"elastic net\" for each gene module, the predictor variables were a set of candidate predicators/regulators. in the case of 10 identified TFs as candidate regulators, we fitted a linear regression model with the elastic net penalty. total RNAseq uncovers nonpolyadenylated transcripts differentially expressed in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. previously, we infected SUP-T1 cells, a human CD4+ T lymphoblast cell line, with HIV-1 LAI. gene biotypea Annotation No. of differentially expressed genes identified in cells infected with: Intact HIV UV-inactivated HIV Total 12 hpi 24 hpi Total 12 hpi 24 hpi Coding 20,317 8,570 1,660 8,189 1,118 826 425 Intergenic 359 248 64 234 51 44 17 lncRNA 16,927 1,098 98 1,074 45 29 18 sncRNA 8,527 29 4 26 the expression of 2,159 DE genes was detected only by mRNAseq. however, there were still 165 DE genes detected only by Total RNAseq. the majority of DE genes detected only by mRNAseq were protein-coding genes. qPCR used oligo(dT) and random primers for cDNA synthesis. a set of 3,264 genes (of 17,316 genes detected overall) had expression abundances 1.5-fold greater or higher in Total RNAseq than the corresponding mRNAseq across more than 50% (6/11) of available samples. expression changes between Total RNAseq and mRNAseq agreed with Total RNAseq. independent analyses by qPCR agreed with total RNAseq. results demonstrate for the first time that many poly(A) host transcripts were differentially expressed during HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells. subgroups a and b were intended to cover DE genes found by mRNAseq (a) or likely found by mRNAseq (b) subgroup c was for genes inherently not well detected by mRNAseq, e.g., poly(A) transcripts. expression changes at 12 hpi measured by mRNAseq versus by Total RNAseq were highly consistent. the scatterplots of panels B to D are based on the full list of DE genes at 12 hpi. the scatterplots of panels B to D are based on the full list of DE genes at 12 hpi. the exclusion criterion was a log2 infection/mock ratio difference larger than 4 and is indicated with the symbol \"+\" transcriptional changes that occurred at 12 hpi did not affect the amount of mature mRNAs until a later time point such as 24 hpi. a similar trend was also evident for subgroup b, suggesting that mature mRNAs in this subgroup were affected by transcriptional changes observed at 12 hpi by Total RNAseq. the interaction of cells with nonreplicating HIV virions can trigger many intracellular molecular events (30, 31) nonreplicating virions induced expression changes similar to those of intact HIVs at 12 hpi. the log2 infection/mock ratios of enriched TFs at 12 and 24 hpi were absent in the treatment of UV-inactivated virions. the binding sites of 58 TFs were enriched (hypergeometric test P value, 0.01) in the promoters of the 12 hpi DE genes. 10 enriched TFs had at least one binding site in 75% of 12 hpi DE genes. NFKB1 and FOS are two other enriched TFs with documented interactions with gp120. long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as a new class of important regulators in various diseases, including HIV-1 infection (34) the results show that the initiation of many of the early host responses was regulated in a replication-independent manner. lncRNAs are associated with early host transcriptional changes. genes were clustered based on the earliest time point at which significant differential expression was detected by qPCR. qPCR measurements of temporal expression changes of a subset of ncRNAs in human airway epithelial cell line Calu-3 cells infected with one of four strains of influenza virus. this includes highly pathogenic H5N1 and recent H7N9 viruses. de lncRNA calculated the correlations of the lncRNA tissue expression levels to protein-coding genes. we then applied gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) to identify functional categories enriched in highly correlated protein-coding genes. results indicate that these less-studied lncRNAs are actually part of the early host response to HIV-1 infection. using Connectivity Map data, we predicted specific TFs and lncRNAs as regulators of early host transcriptional changes. we compared the actual gene expression changes induced by lycorine against that by HIV-1 infection at 12 hpi. of the 1,279 genes differentially expressed at 12 hpi that had common identifiers. most (68%, 870) had reversed expression changes. this list included 32 TFs with binding sites enriched in promoters of 12 hpi DE genes. for each of these 32 TFs, we evaluated if its predicted targets were enriched in the genes with reversed expression changes. mRNAseq of HIV-1 infection (mRNA), and lycorine treatment of three different cell lines. these 32 TFs were grouped into three bins based on their own DE results at 12 hpi: not DE (No), DE (Yes), and DE and subgroups a and b shown in Fig. 2 [Yes (a+b)] the rows of the heatmap are experimental conditions with labels for selected conditions on the left. the columns are genes, and their assignment to each gene module is highlighted by the top colored band. the size and name of each gene module are shown above the colored band. expression changes of genes in module D1 were upregulated, but genes in module D4 were downregulated. genes in both modules tended to be upregulated in CD4+ T cells and lymph nodes isolated from HIV-infected patients. this suggests that the upregulation of these genes during HIV-1 infection is likely driven by regulatory mechanisms similar to those that occur during T effector cell activation. we used 10-fold cross-validation, i.e., the samples were randomly partitioned into 10 sets. the model with the minimum mean cross-validation error was identified and subjected to the predictability assessment. for all 6 downregulated gene modules, the learned models correctly predicted their downregulation. YY1 had the most negative regression coefficients for the module U1, indicating that it negatively regulates the module's expressions. but YY1 had the most positive regression coefficients for modules D4, D5, and D6, an indication of strong positive regulatory effects. these results provide additional evidence that computationally identified TFs are likely regulators, and they provide novel insights into the modular regulation of early transcriptional changes induced by HIV infection. more studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism driving lycorine's inhibitory effect on HIV-1 infection. more studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism driving lycorine's inhibitory effect on HIV-1 infection. total RNAseq uncovers nonpolyadenylated transcripts differentially expressed in HIV-1-infected CD4+ T cells. previously, we infected SUP-T1 cells, a human CD4+ T lymphoblast cell line, with HIV-1 LAI. to extend prior mRNAseq analysis of poly(A)+ transcripts into less-studied poly(A) transcripts, we sequenced total RNAs (Total RNAs) from the lncRNA, processed_transcript, lincRNA,3prime_overlapping_ncrna, antisense, sense_intronic, sense_overlapping. sncRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, misc_RNA, miRNA. in total, 11,094 genes were differentially expressed at one or more time points following HIV-1 infection. the majority of DE genes detected only by mRNAseq were protein-coding genes. only genes from the list of 11,094 DE genes are included here. the classification of gene biotypes is shown in Table 1. a set of 3,264 genes (of 17,316 genes detected overall) had expression abundances 1.5-fold greater or higher in Total RNAseq than the corresponding mRNAseq across more than 50% (6/11) of available samples. this was an indication of the existence of poly(A) transcripts. total RNAseq reveals broad early host transcriptional changes not detected by mRNAseq. mRNAseq identified only a small set (220) of DE genes at 12 hpi. unexpectedly, many more (1,801) DE genes at 12 hpi by Total RNAseq. expression changes at 12 hpi measured by mRNAseq versus total RNAseq were highly consistent. this agreement verifies the significant expression changes at 12 hpi detected by Total RNAseq. the numbers of genes in each subgroup are in parentheses. intraonic read counts from 12 hpi Total RNAseq (C, y axis) and 24 hpi mRNAseq (D, y axis) separately for subgroups a, b, and d. the exclusion criterion was a log2 infection/mock ratio difference larger than 4 and is indicated with the symbol \u201c+\u201d. in total, we found 14 major biological functions enriched in 12 hpi DE genes. for most of these 14 enriched functions, genes spread across multiple subgroups, but with different degrees of relative contributions from each subgroup. for most of these 14 enriched functions, genes spread across multiple subgroups, but with different degrees of relative contributions from each subgroup. functional enrichment analysis also showed that similar functional categories (such as T cell functionality) were enriched in the two lists of DE genes. these results indicate that the initiation of early host responses to HIV-1 infection in CD4+ T cells was largely independent of viral replication. the log2 infection/mock ratios of enriched TFs at 12 and 24 hpi were absent in the treatment of UV-inactivated virions. to investigate if master regulators were driving early host transcriptional changes, we searched for transcription factors (TFs) binding sites of 58 TFs were enriched in the promoters of 12 hpi DE genes. MYC was the most downregulated TF at 12 hpi in samples from HIV-1-infected cells and in samples from cells treated with UV-inactivated virions. binding sites were also enriched in the DE genes derived from cells treated with UV-inactivated virions at 12 hpi. cRNAs have emerged as a new class of important regulators in various diseases, including HIV-1 infection (34). compared to our prior analysis of mRNAseq data (1), here we identified many more (1,098) DE lncRNAs due to the expanded lncRNA annotation and the added Total RNAseq data. in human airway epithelial cells infected with one of four strains of influenza virus. we profiled a subset of these same lncRNAs in human airway epithelial cells. this includes highly pathogenic H5N1 and recent H7N9 viruses. 12 TF binding sites were enriched (P 0.05) in promoters of DE lncRNAs. but not in non-DE lncRNAs. AP-1 is composed of homo- and heterodimers formed between Jun and Fos proteins. cmap returned drugs that induced similar and opposite transcriptional changes at 12 hpi. lycorine, the highest-ranked drug with a negative connectivity score, had an average connectivity score of 0.699 over 5 different tests. 5 other drugs also had negative connectivity scores. in total, 14 (44%) of 32 TFs had their predicted targets enriched. those TFs which themselves were also differentially expressed at 12 hpi tended to be more likely to have targets enriched in genes with reversed expression changes. the use of both mRNA differential expression and binding site enrichment at 12 hpi significantly improved our TF predictions. derivation of regulatory programs to predict early host transcriptional changes upon HIV-1 infection. we first compiled a compendium of human expression data that are related to HIV infection and/or CD4+ T cells. from the coexpression network, we identified 9 gene modules, i.e., clusters of highly interconnected genes. the boxplot for each TF shows the distribution of its regression coefficients across the 10 predictive models. the boxplot in purple shows the spread of 10 predicted values from the models using 10 identified TFs as candidate regulators. each of the 10 learned models generated one predicted expression change for the gene module. genes in the module U1 also tended to be upregulated in CD4+ T cells and lymph nodes isolated from HIV-infected patients. expression changes in two types of activated CD4+ T cells were opposite: downregulated during regulatory T cell activation but upregulated during T effector cell activation. this suggests that the upregulation of these genes during HIV-1 infection is likely driven by regulatory mechanisms similar to those that occur during T effector cell activation. validation error was identified and subjected to the predictability assessment. for each gene module, we built predictive models with those 10 identified TFs as candidate predictors and the median expression change of genes of the module as the response variable. 3 of them had predicted values very close to the median expression change, the metric used to learn the predictive model. ELK4 and ETS1 were not selected for module D4, suggesting no or very little regulatory effect. but they had relatively large regression coefficients for modules D2, D3 and D6, an indication of large effects there. these results provide additional evidence that computationally identified TFs are likely regulators, and they provide novel insights into the modular regulation of early transcriptional changes induced by HIV infection. corine can target many host genes, such as SMAD3 gene. NFKB was upregulated here and identified as a regulator. more studies are needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism driving lycorine's inhibitory effect on HIV-1 infection. mRNAseq and Total RNAseq combined mRNAseq and mRNAseq to quantify both poly(A)+ and poly(A) transcripts. this contrasts to standard transcriptome analysis focusing on poly(A)+ mature mRNAs using microarray or mRNAseq. one big challenge for Total RNAseq is to deplete abundant rRNAs. nascent transcripts will likely offer a more accurate picture of the kinetics of transcriptional induction than mRNA analyses in the case of HIV-1 infection. the knockdown of the lncRNA NEAT1 also upregulated here (Fig. 1D), enhanced HIV-1 production by increasing the export of Rev-dependent instability element-containing HIV-1 mRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm (34). the integration of emerging ncRNAs is made feasible because the generation of genome-scale data by RNAseq or CHiP-seq is independent of gene annotation. the integration of emerging ncRNAs is made feasible because the generation of genome-scale data by RNAseq or CHiP-seq is independent of gene annotation. we showed experimentally that lycorine potently inhibited HIV-1 infection of CD4+ T cells. this result convincingly demonstrates that the principle strategy that we developed will be effective in discovering more host-based antiviral therapies. this study provides a framework for better understanding HIV biology through iterations of systems level analyses."}
