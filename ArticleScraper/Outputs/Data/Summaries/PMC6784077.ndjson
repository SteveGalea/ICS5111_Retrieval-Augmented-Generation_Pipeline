{"summary": "ART has been successful in controlling HIV-1 replication, especially in suppressing HIV loads, restoring immune function, as well as improving longevity and quality of life [2]. but steps should be taken to develop more drugs based on the very rapid emergence of drug resistance and the poor pharmacokinetics of drugs. two long-acting peptides were conjugated to the N-terminus of C34. we confirmed their binding to NHR to form stable 6-HB. we then analyzed their inhibitory activity on Env-mediated cell\u2013cell fusion and virus infection. an aqueous solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate (5 mM) was added to a stirred mixture of cysteine-incorporated C34 (cC34, 10 mg, 2.3 mol) and mPEG-MAL (2 or 5 kDa, 2 equivalent) in a sodium phosphate buffer (5 mL, 5 mM, pH 7.5) to adjust the pH of the mixture to 7.2. the resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min at room the -helical content was calculated from the CD signal by dividing the mean residue ellipticity at 222 nm. thermal denaturation was performed by monitoring the ellipticity change at 222 nm from 20 \u00b0C to 98 \u00b0C. hek-293T cells were seeded at 5 105 cells/well in six well plates for overnight incubation. the next day, TZM-bl cells expressing CD4 and the coreceptor for HIV-1 as target cells were seeded at 1 104 in DMEM medium. peptides were diluted in DMEM medium in 2-fold dilutions and added to the TZM-bl cells (104/well), followed by addition of HIV-1 (200 TCID50/well) after culture for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C, the viral infectivity was measured using the luciferase assay and the inhibitory activity of the peptides was calculated. the highest dilution-fold of the plasma sample was calculated. the concentration of an active peptide in plasma was estimated [20] and its half-life and other pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using MODFIT software. ethics We complied with relevant institutional and national standards for animal care and experimentation. an aqueous solution of disodium hydrogen phosphate (5 mM) was added to a stirred mixture of cysteine-incorporated C34 (C34, 10 mg, 2.3 mol) and mPEG-MAL (2 or 5 kDa, 2 equivalent) in a sodium phosphate buffer (5 mL, 5 mM, pH 7.5) to adjust the pH of the mixture to 7.2. the resulting mixture was stirred for 10 min at room temperature native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (N-PAGE) Tris-glycine gel (18%) was used for N-PAGE. Peptide N36 was incubated with PBS at the indicated concentrations at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min before the addition of C34, PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34. the gradient concentration of the peptide was 0, 50 and 100 M, respectively. HEK-293T cells were seeded at 5 105 cells/well in six well plates for overnight incubation. the next day, TZM-bl cells expressing CD4 and the coreceptor for HIV-1 as target cells were seeded at 1 104 in DMEM medium. on the third day, 100 L of peptide at graded concentrations was added to TZM-b1 cells at a ratio of 1:1. peptides were diluted in DMEM medium in 2-fold dilutions and added to the TZM-bl cells (104/well), followed by addition of HIV-1 (200 TCID50/well). after culture for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C, the viral infectivity was measured using the luciferase assay and the inhibitory activity of the peptides was calculated. peptide sequences were protected by N-terminal acetylation and C-terminal amidation. HPLC chromatogram analysis of purity of PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34. CD spectroscopy detected the specific interaction between the NHR peptide N36 and C34, as well as the PEGylated C34 peptides. the melting temperature, defined as the midpoint of thermal unfolding transition, of the N36/PEGylated C34 complexes was slightly lower than that of the N36/C34 complex. peptides N36, C34, PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 exhibited low cytotoxicity on TZM-bl cells with CC50 values greater than 100 M. the gradient concentration of the peptides was 0, 50 and 100 M. in this study, we tested the inhibitory activities of the peptides on 47 strains of HIV-1 isolates circulating in China. the results showed that PEGylated C34 peptides had lower EC50 on HIV-1 isolates circulating in china, when compared to T20. sensitivity results for subtype CRF08_BC need to be further confirmed. the virus that contained the V38A, N43K, V38A/N42D or V38A/N42T were resistant to T20 (3\u201311 fold), C34 (15\u2013156 fold), PEG2kC34 (7\u201328 fold) and PEG5kC34 (7\u201316 fold) the resistant fold decreased compared to C34 (15\u2013156 fold) the plasma from rats treated with PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 reached the highest peak level at 2 h then dropped slowly and decreased to an undetectable level at 4 h post injection. the plasma from rats treated with C34 reached the highest peak level at 2 h then dropped slowly and decreased to an undetectable level at 24 h post injection. rat plasma was harvested before injection and at different time points. antiviral activities of C34, PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 were determined. plasma dilutions required for 50% inhibition of NL4-3infection were determined. the reaction proceeded in mild conditions (pH 7.2, room temperature) and finished within a short period (10 min) to afford nearly quantitative PEGylated C34. the products were purified by semi-preparative HPLC and characterized by MALDI-TOF mass spectrum. CD spectroscopy detected the specific interaction between the NHR peptide N36 and C34, as well as the PEGylated C34 peptides. the melting temperature, defined as the midpoint of thermal unfolding transition, was slightly lower than that of the N36/PEGylated C34 complex. peptides PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 could effectively inhibit cell\u2013cell fusion with an EC50 of about 36 nM. they also inhibit replication of the laboratory-adapted strain NL4-3 with EC50 of about 4\u20135 nM. sensitivity results for the CRF07_BC subtype need to be further confirmed. sensitivity results for subtype CRF08_BC need to be further confirmed. sensitivity results for subtype CRF08_BC need to be further confirmed. resistant fold of PEG2kC34 (7\u201328 fold) and PEG5kC34 (7\u201316 fold) decreased compared to C34 (15\u2013156 fold) the resistance of T20-Induced HIV-1 Mutants to PEGylated HIV-1 Fusion Inhibitors is shown. plasma from rats treated with PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 reached highest peak level at 2 h then dropped slowly and decreased to an undetectable level at 24 h post injection. t1/2 of PEG5kC34 was about 3.4-fold and 4.6-fold longer than T20 (1.5 h) and C34 (1.1 h) ART has successfully transformed HIV-1 infection into a chronic and manageable disease. prevalence of drug resistance and treatment is only effective before HIV-1 develops resistance against the administered drugs. the first approved HIV fusion inhibitor was used to treat HIV-infected patients who failed to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs [23] but its clinical application was limited due to its half-life [32] this calls for the development of new HIV fusion drugs. many approaches have been developed to improve the pharmaceutical profiles of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors. the conjugates showed broad spectrum anti-HIV-1 activity with low cytotoxicity. they showed potent anti-fusion activity and anti-viral activity for most isolates. the sensitivities of HIV-1 to different drugs might be affected by mutation sites, subtypes and co-receptors. the addition of a group to the C-terminal of an HIV-1 peptide fusion inhibitor decreased its antiviral potency. the bulky polymer shells might have given rise to transport limitations to- and from the viral target that exert an overall negative impact on antiviral potency. the plasma half-life (t1/2) of PEGylated C34 peptides in SD rats was prolonged. we found that the plasma t1/2 of PEG2kC34 and PEG5kC34 was prolonged, suggesting that the PEGylated C34 had better potential for further development."}
