{"summary": "virus titer peaks 10 days post-infection [1], [10], post-exposure treatment remains viable. many of the reported HmAbs against SARS-CoV fail to neutralize all of the clinical isolates [11]\u2013[13]. synthetic HR2 peptides as well as HR2 specific antibodies have been shown to block SARS-CoV infection [25]\u2013[27]. the RBD shows high rates of mutation which allows the virus to escape neutralization by Abs without losing its ability to infect cells [13], [28]. this raises the possibility that Abs against this region may confer better protection against a broad spectrum of clinical isolates. pcDNA3.1- S coding the full length S protein of SARS-CoV was used as a template in site directed mutagenesis PCR using QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Stratagene) the same procedure and primers were used for the generation of the full length S protein mutant constructs. purified proteins were concentrated through Centricon filters (Millipore, Bedford, MA) then detected by Coomassie blue staining (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) the expression was further confirmed by western blot using polyclonal goat anti-human IgG Fc HRP antibody. the same procedure was followed for testing the binding of 39 non S1 neutralizing HmAbs against S protein ectodomain, S2, HR1, HR2 and S1 domain proteins. the same procedure was followed for testing the binding of 39 non S1 neutralizing HmAbs against S protein ectodomain, S2, HR1, HR2 and S1 domain proteins. the same procedure was followed for testing the binding of 39 non S1 neutralizing HmAbs against S protein ectodomain, luciferase expression was determined using luciferase assay kit. rabbit immune serum was used as a positive control for entry inhibition. antibody mediated inhibitions of different mutant pseudoviruses were then normalized to HIV/Urbani-S inhibitions. all the forward primers were designed with a 5\u2032 NheI site. the reverse primers were designed with a 5\u2032 BamHI site. the PCR products were then cloned into the C-terminus IgG tag mammalian expression vector. the antibody concentration was measured at 280 nm using the Biomate3S UV-Visible Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific) all HmAbs were diluted to a final concentration of 50 g/ml. binding of the 18 HmAbs was tested by ELISA as described previously. the incorporation of the S proteins in the virus particles was confirmed by western blot using 1D4 anti-rhodopsin mouse monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) the virus p24Ag content was confirmed by mouse anti-HIV1 p24 monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) the clinical isolates with the identified RBD mutations are named Sin845, GZ-C, GD01 and GZ0402. the mutated 12-510 S1-IgG proteins were expressed in 293FT cells. the binding at the highest concentration used is shown. the GZ0402-S1 protein showed minimal binding to 15/18 HmAbs. 57%, 52% and 69% binding to HmAbs 4D4, 6B1 and 3C7 respectively. surprisingly, the GZ-C S1 protein showed an increased binding to all 18 HmAbs. as little as 25 ng of the GZ-C protein could block HmAb 5A7 binding to the Urbani-S1 protein. as much as 200 ng of Urbani protein was significantly less efficient in blocking the HmAb 5A7 binding to the GZ-C-S1 protein. Pseudoviruses expressing mutant S proteins entered 293 cells. they stably expressing ACE2 with equal efficiency when compared to the HIV/S positive control. the HmAbs did not show significant inhibition of VSV-G pseudotyped virus. recombinant S protein ectodomain, S2 domain, HR1 and HR2 proteins were expressed in 293FT cells and purified using protein-A agarose beads. thirty nine non-S1 binding but Urbani strain S-ectodomain binding and neutralizing HmAbs were successfully purified and tested. HmAbs to HR1 and HR2 can effectively neutralize surrogate clinical isolates.

RBD contains major neutralizing epitopes, and S2 domain which consists mainly of HR1 and HR2 domains. we aligned the RBD amino acid sequences available from 94 clinical isolates. the clinical isolates with the identified RBD mutations are named Sin845, GZ-C, GD01 and GZ0402. 1 showed about 50% binding to Sin845 S1 protein relative to their binding to Urbani S1 protein. the GD01-S1 protein showed a diminished binding to 16/18 HmAbs and binding of about 40% and 60% to 4D4 and 3C7 HmAbs respectively. CoV-S Urbani polyclonal serum showed strong reactivity (OD 0.4) against the GZ-C-S1 mutant even at a high dilution (1/1280) while it showed much lower binding to Sin845-S1, GD01-S1 and GZ0402-S1 proteins relative to its binding to the Urbani-S1 protein. as little as 25 ng of the GZ-C protein could block HmAb 5A7 binding to the Urbani- mutant S proteins entered 293 cells, stably expressing ACE2, with equal efficiency when compared to the HIV/S positive control. Pseudoviruses Containing S Proteins with RBD Sequences of Sin845, GD01 and GZ0402 Isolates Escape Neutralization While GZ-C Shows Enhanced Neutralization by S1 Specific HmAbs. polyclonal rabbit immune serum (PolyAb) was used as a positive control. error bars represent SD of a representative experiment performed in triplicates. HmAbs to HR1 and HR2 can effectively neutralize surrogate clinical isolates.
