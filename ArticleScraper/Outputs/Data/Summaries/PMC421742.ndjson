{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, with an estimated global prevalence of 170 million chronic infections. this finding has implications for potential transmission of HCV through contact with contaminated nasal secretions. intranasal cocaine use as a significant risk factor for HCV among volunteer blood donors. contaminated implements used to nasally inhale powdered drugs include heroin, cocaine, and methamphetamines. chronic nasal inhalation can cause tissue deterioration and bleeding of nasal membranes. the fifth subject tested seropositive for HCV antibodies but HCV PCR negative (600 copies/mL) all subjects were male between 46 to 56 years of age and HIV-1 seropositive. samples from nasal swabs were placed into sterile tubes containing 1 mL of TRIzol reagent (Glibco BRL) and stored at -70\u00b0C. study protocols were approved by an Institutional Review Board. gene-specific downstream primers targeting the HCV p22 core region were amplified by PCR through 40 cycles of denaturation (94\u00b0C-1 min), annealing (55\u00b0C-1 min) and elongation (72\u00b0C-1 min) PCR products were resolved through 1% agarose gel electrophoresis, hybridized to 32P-labeled internal probe (5'-AGGAAGACTTCCGCGGTCG CAA-3') not done due to bleeding diathesis 96,000 (02/04) 16 (10/03) 3 1,320,000 (10/03) Pos Neg Pos 16,900 (02/04) 110 (10/03) Grade 2/3 of 4 Stage 2/3 of 4 (11/03) 182 (02/04) 4 234,000 (12/02) Neg Neg Neg 72,031 (12/02) 37 (12/03) Grade 1 of 4 Stage 1 of 4 (11/03) 50 (12/03) 5 600 Neg Neg Pos 212,000 (10/03) 41 RNA extraction and phase separation obtained by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. RNA was precipitated with 0.5 mL of isopropyl alcohol for 10 min at 21\u00b0C followed by centrifugation at 12 000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. RNA pellets were resuspended in 10 L of RNase-free water. five consecutive plasma-positive clinic patients were selected for study. each contributed blood and nasal secretion samples for HCV RT-PCR analysis. highest serum concentrations of viral RNA were detected in subjects 1 and 2 and the lowest in subjects 5. more research is needed to replicate our results, provide an accurate estimate of HCV prevalence in the nasal secretions of plasma-positive patients. future research should also address whether the presence of HCV in the nasal cavity affects the progression of upper respiratory infections such as influenza, rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus."}
