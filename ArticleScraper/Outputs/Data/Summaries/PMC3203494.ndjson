{"summary": "a swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus that arose in 2009 reminds us of the persistent risk of influenza pandemics. the most striking example is certainly the \u2018Spanish\u2019 influenza pandemic of 1918\u20131919 that occurred in three waves and caused about 50 million deaths worldwide in only nine months. the explicit reports of individuals experiencing reinfections over a short time interval during pandemic seasons are still poorly understood. this report challenges the assumption that influenza infection confers life-long protection against reinfection by the same strain. it is possible to fit mathematical models in which individuals can be reinfected by the same strain to multiple-wave outbreaks [11,12]. however, these existing models have been endowed with different biological interpretations. data TdC is a volcanic island in the south Atlantic Ocean. it has been inhabited since the nineteenth century and in 1971, the 284 islanders were living in the single village of the island: Edinburgh of the Seven Seas. five islanders developed acute respiratory disease during the 8 day voyage. the other two presented similar symptoms immediately after landing. the epidemic faded out after this second wave and lasted 59 days. the first biological hypothesis assumes that two separate viral agents, with different transmissibility, were introduced at the beginning of the epidemic. the Mutation (Mut) hypothesis assumes that a single initiating virus mutated within an infected host during the first epidemic wave, leading to the emergence of a new antigenic variant. six models with six different reinfection mechanisms can be retrieved by adding to three common skeletons (in black) the transitions corresponding to the indicated colour. all models have five epidemiological states in common: susceptible (S), exposed (E), clinically ill and infectious (I), temporarily removed from the transmission process (R) the dashed red arrow indicates that at time Tmut if I1> 0, one infectious host with the initial strain becomes infectious with the mutated strain (j = 2). in the PPI model (green), we assume that hosts acquire full protection against reinfection with probability, otherwise they suffer from an intra-host reinfection and, after some time, re-enter the I state. stochastic framework of continuous-time Markov chains allows demographic stochasticity to be taken into account. the six models are provided in electronic supplementary material, text S1.5. model-predicted incidence is computed by counting the daily number of new hosts entering the infectious class I. data TdC is a volcanic island in the south Atlantic Ocean. it has been inhabited since the nineteenth century. in 1971, the 284 islanders were living in the single village of the island. a small population with a small and homogeneous immune repertoire against influenza virus occurred in 1971, 3 years after the global emergence of the new subtype A/H3N2. only 312 of the 365 attacks (85%) are known to within a single day of accuracy and constitute the dataset. the first biological hypothesis assumes that two separate viral agents were introduced at the beginning of the epidemic. the Mutation hypothesis assumes that a single initiating virus mutated within an infected host during the first epidemic wave, leading to the emergence of a new antigenic variant. our immunological hypotheses motivate a more accurate description of the different stages from infection to development of long-term protective immunity. the six models with six different reinfection mechanisms can be retrieved by adding to three common skeletons (in black) the transitions corresponding to the indicated colour. strain i enter the Li class and become completely protected against reinfection by strain i while remaining susceptible to the other circulating strain j. the two strains are supposed to have the same transmissibility (1 = 2, see electronic supplementary material, text S1.2) and to interact through a cross-immunity parameter [0,1] that acts by reducing the susceptibility to the other strain. the transition rates to simulate the six stochastic models are provided in electronic supplementary material, text S1.5. simulation and model selection Given the small population of TdC, demographic stochasticity is expected to play a significant role in the epidemic dynamics. the rescaled AICc values allow for an immediate ranking of the competing models and show that the Win mechanism best explains the data. the rescaled AICc values, presented in figure 3, allow for an immediate ranking of the competing models. the two different values of R0 for the 2Vi model correspond to the low and high transmissible viruses. the differences in AICc accumulate during the inter-wave period, the second epidemic wave and the extinction period after the second wave (figure 4a\u2013e, lower panels) for each model and associated ML parameter set, the mean predicted incidence (solid line) and corresponding 95% confidence envelope owing to demographic stochasticity and observation error (shaded area) were computed over 105 stochastic simulations by conditioning on occurrence of the second epidemic wave (electronic supplementary material, text S4) our predictive simulations emphasize the paramount role of demographic stochasticity in the multiple-wave infection dynamics on this small island. the highly transmissible virus outcompetes the poorly transmissible virus, which has a 35 per cent risk of extinction. however, the newly emerging variant in the Mut hypothesis has a 60 per cent chance of early extinction. reinfection is self-sustained and dynamics are SIS-like, whereas below this threshold primary infection dominates and leads to SIR-like dynamics. the reinfection parameter must be sufficiently high to reduce stochastic extinctions during the inter-wave period. the first observation concerns the high values of the basic reproduction number (R0) and its large variation from one model to another. R0 estimates are similar for the Mut, AoN and Win models (around 10), slightly lower for the PPI model, but more than twice as high for the InH model owing to an identifiability issue. ML estimates under the two best models are 13.61 days (Win) and 11.57 days (AoN) heterogeneity among hosts is a significantly more likely explanation for 1971's two-wave influenza outbreak on TdC than viral heterogeneity (e.g. in antigenic type) this suggestion finds empirical support in known mechanisms of immunity to influenza. antibodies can remain detectable for years after infection and prevent reinfection by the same strain as well as by sufficiently cross-reactive variants. innate and cellular responses play the key role in viral clearance. the primary CTL response is detectable in blood after 6\u201314 days. the neutralizing antibody response peaks at four to six weeks. the high level of consanguinity among the islanders may also have led to the over-representation of an unusual genotype involved in the control of influenza. ecological factors including the dose of virus that initiates infection may shape Win or AoN immunity, or indeed may make Win immunity appear as an AoN phenomenon. if force of infection is high, most hosts will have closed that window before re-exposure. both mechanisms challenge the human immune response following primary influenza infection. some individuals with delayed (Win) or deficient (AoN) humoral immune response could be reinfected by the same strain. surveillance of more recent influenza outbreaks may offer suitable data. the maximized likelihood provides a first quantitative answer to the objective question: 'How likely is it that the stochastic process resulted in the observed epidemic' the rescaled AICc values, presented in figure 3, allow for an immediate ranking of the competing models. comparison of the behaviour of the best model (Win) with each competitor reveals superimposed dynamics with the AoN model. extinction probability increases rapidly at the end of the first wave for the 2Vi, Mut and PPI models. extinction probability increases rapidly at the end of the first wave. absolute differences allow quantitative identification of the parts of the time series where the Win model is better than the competing model Hi (Win > Hi) evolution of the absolute cumulative differences indicates that the Win model performs always better than the competing model, at least after the second epidemic wave has begun. if the highly transmissible virus maintains a low prevalence until the end of the first wave, then it can initiate the second epidemic wave (electronic supplementary material, figure S8) on the other hand, the newly emerging variant in the Mut hypothesis has a 60 per cent chance of early extinction. the Win hypothesis assumes that 100 per cent of the infected hosts can be reinfected during a limited period lasting an average of 4.8 days. the AoN hypothesis assumes that only 47 per cent of the infected hosts can be reinfected at any time. this superimposed dynamics is in fact specific to the epidemiological context of a large population. ML estimates under the two best models are 3.2 days (Win) and 3.3 days (AoN) the generation time can be estimated by the sum of the mean latent period plus half the mean duration of infectiousness. heterogeneity among hosts is a significantly more likely explanation for 1971's two-wave influenza outbreak on TdC than viral heterogeneity (e.g. in antigenic type) this suggestion finds empirical support in known mechanisms of immunity to influenza. a multi-pronged innate and adaptive [34] immune response is optimal for clearing influenza infection. a protective serum antibody response cannot be detected in approximately 20 per cent of subjects after natural influenza infection [38]. a high level of consanguinity among the islanders may also have led to over-representation of an unusual genotype involved in the control of influenza. a stochastic formulation is essential to capture demographic stochasticity induced by small populations [24] and/or low-prevalence inter-wave periods. both mechanisms challenge the human immune response following primary influenza infection, indicating that some individuals with delayed (Win) or deficient (AoN) humoral immune response could be reinfected by the same strain. both parameter estimates and immunological support for the Win model indicate that successive infections by the same strain spaced over more than four to six weeks can only be explained by the AoN mechanism. the results advocate a better account of host heterogeneity in the analysis of multiple-wave outbreaks."}
