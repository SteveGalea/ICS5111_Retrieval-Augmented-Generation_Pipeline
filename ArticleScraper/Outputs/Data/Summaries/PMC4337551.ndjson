{"summary": "HCMV infection induces the expression of type I interferon and a set of interferon-stimulated genes early upon infection. however, HCMV encodes multiple proteins, including IE1 (4\u20136), IE2 (7\u20139), pp65 (10, 11), and TRS1 and IRS1 (12, 13) HCMV has developed mechanisms for combating the host antiviral response but also to exploit antiviral molecules for its own benefit. the majority of the viruses restricted by IFITMs are enveloped RNA viruses whose entry is mediated through clathrin-mediated endocytosis (18). however, the precise mechanism that allows IFITMs to inhibit virus replication remains elusive. IFITMs may interfere with a membrane fusion step of virus entry either at the cell surface or in the endosome/lysosome compartments. a recent study reports that IFITM protein overexpression fails to inhibit the entry of three DNA viruses. but detailed mechanistic investigations have not been performed. HCMV profoundly reorganizes the cellular secretory apparatus to facilitate virus assembly and egress during the later stage of its life cycle. pIPFLAG2-IFITM3, containing human IFITM3 cDNA, was constructed as described previously. a flag tag-coding sequence was introduced into the IFITM3 cDNA at the 5\u2032 end by PCR amplification. the DNA fragment was then cloned into plasmid pLKO.DCMV.TetO. two IFITM-targeting shRNA (sh8024 or sh8025)-expressing lentiviral vectors were constructed on the basis of the pLKO.1 vector. the primary antibodies used in this study included anti-tubulin (Proteintech), anti-IFITM1 (mouse monoclonal antibody; Proteintech), anti-IFITM2/3 (mouse monoclonal antibody; Proteintech), anti-GM130 (Cell Signaling), anti- pAD-GFP carries the whole genome of HCMV lab strain AD169. pAD-GFP is derived from pAD/Cre, but the viral US4-US6 region is replaced by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene under the control of a simian virus 40 (SV40) early promoter (49, 50) cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline, lysed in sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) sample buffer, then scraped and collected by centrifugation. cell lysates containing equal cell numbers were resolved by electrophoresis on sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing polyacrylamide gels, then transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline and stained with either Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antirabbit antibody (1:1,000; Invitrogen-Molecular Probes) cells were counterstained with DAPI (4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; 1:5,000; Beyotime) for 10 min. images were captured using a leica TCS SP5 confocal laser scanning microscope. 10 microliters of concentrated virus was treated with DNase I (30 U; Promega) at 37\u00b0C for 30 min to remove residual DNA that was not protected by the virus particle. the samples were then incubated at 55\u00b0C overnight in lysis buffer. the aqueous phase were collected and treated with 20 g of RNase A/ml for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then extracted again with phenol-chloroform. transcript accumulation was quantified by reverse transcription coupled to real-time PCR. total RNAs were extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and reverse transcribed using a PrimeScript RT reagent kit (TaKaRa) the cDNAs were then quantified with a primer specific for the cellular genes IFITM1, IFITM2, IFITM3, and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogen pLKO.DCMV.TetO is a pLKO-based lentiviral vector under control of a tetracycline-inducible CMV-TetO2 promoter (48) to generate pLKO-Flag-IFITM3 expression construct. mismatch mutations in the IFITM-targeting shRNA sh8025 target sequence were introduced into IFITM3 cDNA by overlapping PCR. anti-IFITM2/3 (mouse monoclonal antibody; Proteintech), anti-GM130 (Cell Signaling), anti-flag (Abmart), anti-immediate early (anti-IE) protein IE1/2 (a generous gift from Jay Nelson, Oregon Health & Science University), and anti-pp28 and anti-UL38 (gifts from Thomas Shenk, Princeton University). subconfluent cells were transduced with lentiviruses encoding the shRNAs indicated above. cells were then incubated for 5 h at 37\u00b0C, washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and added to fresh medium. at 48 h posttransfection, cell lysates were collected for Western blotting to detect knockdown efficiencies of the shRNAs. ulfate-containing polyacrylamide gels were transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride membranes, hybridized with primary antibodies, and reacted with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. the membranes were then treated with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Bio-Rad) the protein bands were then imaged by exposure to X-ray films (Kodak). MRC5 cells were infected with wild-type virus at a multiplicity of infection of 0.3. total DNAs were extracted with phenol-chloroform, treated with 100 g/ml RNase A, precipitated with ethanol, and then lysed in water. the virion DNA in the aqueous phase was precipitated with ethanol and resuspended in water. the accumulation of viral DNAs was normalized by dividing the number of IE gene equivalents by the number of -actin gene equivalents. total RNAs were extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) shRNA-expressing lentivirus-transduced cells were infected with HCMV at an MOI of 0.5. cells on the coverslips were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 1 h. cells on the coverslips were fixed with 2.5% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 1 h and postfixed with 2% aqueous OsO4 for 1.5 h. HCMV infection suppresses IFITM gene expression. mRNA levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2 were relatively constant after 24 hpi. the protein levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2/3 were analyzed by immunoblotting. we infected MRC5 cells with HCMV in the presence or absence of ganciclovir or with UV-inactivated virus. we then measured IFITM protein accumulation at 48 hpi. a maximum inhibition of IFITM expression requires a late viral event or late viral protein expression. at 24 hpi, the IFITM1 signal became stronger, probably due to the increase in the level of IFITM1 expression with time. we had confirmed the specificity of the IFITM1 antibody by staining cells expressing shRNA targeting IFITM1 (25) at 48 hpi and particularly at 72 hpi, the reduction of the IFITM1 signal became apparent. we compared virus growth at both a high and a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) in MRC5 cells stably expressing flag-tagged human IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 proteins. virus production was enhanced slightly by about 3-fold in IFITM-expressing cells compared with that in the control cells at later time points. dpi was determined using a TCID50 assay. HCMV infection suppressed endogenous and overexpressed flag-IFITM3. both flag-tagged IFITM3 and endogenous IFITM2/3 were detected. the transcription of the Flag-tagged IFITMs was driven by an exogenous promoter that differed from the promoter driving endogenous transcription. HCMV infection can inhibit IFITM protein expression at both the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels, which might suppress IFITM mRNA nuclear export or attenuate translation. we used two different IFITM-targeting shRNA sequences to knock down IFITMs to demonstrate their requirement for efficient HCMV replication. to do this, we compared the growth of herpes simplex virus in control cells and cells in which IFITM was knocked down. natant was collected at the indicated times postinfection. titers were determined using a TCID50 assay. the experimental procedures were similar to those described in the legend to panel B. replication by quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed that the kinetics of virus DNA synthesis were similar in both cell types. these data suggest that IFITMs are involved in a very late step of the virus life cycle, i.e., after viral DNA synthesis and late protein accumulation. ratio of the TCID50 results relative to the DNA copy number was calculated for each sample. the ratio of the TCID50 results relative to the DNA copy number for the progeny virus produced in shC-expressing cells was set equal to 1. the ratio of the infectious unit to the number of genome copies of the secreted virus stock was set equal to 1. the vAC is formed via the reorganization of the Golgi apparatus and endosomal membrane structures. they formed typical circular structures in cells that expressed the control shRNA. they failed to form a ring-like structure in both the sh8024- and sh8025-expressing cells. the defect in the proper formation of vAC in the absence of IFITM proteins was statistically significant. MRC5 cells transduced with shC-, sh8024-, or sh8025-expressing lentiviruses were infected with HCMV (AD/Cre) at an MOI of 0.5. cells were fixed at 72 h postinfection and stained with antibodies against virus structural protein pp28 and the Golgi apparatus marker GM130. DAPI was used to stain the nuclei. cells from the assay whose results are presented in panel C were counted for the presence of regular vAC and irregular vAC. n, number of infected cells counted; ***, P 0.002. MRC5 cells transduced with shC- or sh8025-expressing lentiviruses were infected with HCMV (AD/Cre) at an MOI of 0.5. cells were fixed at 72 h postinfection and stained with we went on to examine the effect of IFITM suppression on HCMV virion assembly by electron microscopy. all three forms of nuclear capsids could be detected in the presence or absence of IFITMs. the numbers of A and C capsids were actually increased after IFITM knockdown. MRC5 cells were transduced with shC- or sh8025-expressing lentiviruses. cells were fixed at 96 hpi and prepared for electron microscopy. a capsids (white arrow), B capsids (white arrowhead) and C capsids (white arrowhead with a black border) are indicated. square box in panel C is shown at a higher magnification in panel D. areas labeled G and H in panel F are shown at higher magnifications. arrow in panel G, the golgi stacks; arrow in panel H, incompletely assembled virion particles without envelopment. s of all three IFITM genes was reduced after HCMV infection. mRNA levels of IFITM1 and IFITM2 remained relatively constant after 24 hpi. the mRNA level decreased continuously to less than 20% of that of the mock-infected cells at 72 hpi. a longer exposure of anti-IFITM1 was used as the loading control. we infected MRC5 cells with HCMV in the presence or absence of ganciclovir. we then measured IFITM protein accumulation at 48 hpi. this effect is suppressed by viral events or viral gene expression after entry. IFITM1 was expressed at a low level in mock-infected cells. at 24 hpi, the signal became stronger, probably due to the increase in the level of IFITM1 expression with time. we had confirmed the specificity of the antibody by staining cells expressing shRNA targeting IFITM1 (25) we compared virus growth at both a high and a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) in MRC5 cells stably expressing flag-tagged human IFITM1, IFITM2 or IFITM3 proteins. MRC5 cells were transduced with an empty lentiviral vector. the cell-free virus in the supernatant was collected on the indicated days postinfection (dpi) the titer was determined using a TCID50 assay. HCMV infection suppressed endogenous and overexpressed Flag-IFITM3. both flag-tagged IFITM3 and endogenous IFITM2/3 were detected. the endogenous level became undetectable, and the level of flag-tagged IFITM3 after infection was approximately equivalent to the endogenous level before infection. the transcription of the Flag-tagged IFITMs was driven by an exogenous promoter that differed from the promoter driving endogenous transcription. this could suppress IFITM mRNA nuclear export, attenuate translation, or induce protein degradation. the impairment of HCMV growth was much lower in the sh8024-expressing cells than the sh8025-expressing cells. however, we used two different IFITM-targeting shRNA sequences to knock down IFITMs to demonstrate their requirement for efficient HCMV replication. we compared the growth of herpes simplex virus (HSV) in control cells and cells in which IFITM was knocked down. titers were determined using a TCID50 assay. MRC5 cells were transduced with shC, sh8024, or sh8025. the supernatant was collected at the indicated times postinfection. cells in which IFITM was knocked down indicate that virus gene expression was not affected. we measured virus DNA replication by quantitative PCR (qPCR) and observed that the kinetics of virus DNA synthesis were similar in both cell types. this suggests that IFITMs are involved in a very late step of the virus life cycle. each virus stock was divided into two to measure the number of infectious units by a TCID50 assay and the genome copy number by qPCR. the ratio of the TCID50 results relative to the DNA copy number for the progeny virus produced in shC-expressing cells was set equal to 1. HCMV virion assembly occurs at a virus-induced perinucleus structure called the vAC, which is formed via the reorganization of the Golgi apparatus and endosomal membrane structures. the defect in the proper formation of vAC in the absence of IFITM proteins was statistically significant. MRC5 cells transduced with shC-, sh8024-, or sh8025-expressing lentiviruses were infected with HCMV (AD/Cre) at an MOI of 0.5. cells were fixed at 96 h postinfection and stained with antibodies against virus structural protein pp28 and the Golgi apparatus marker GM130. cells from the assay whose results are presented in panel C were counted for the presence of regular vAC and irregular vAC. n, number of infected cells counted; ***, P 0.002. MRC5 cells transduced with shC- or sh8025-expressing lentiviruses were infected with HCMV at an MOI of 0.5. ultrastructural analysis by electron microscopy revealed a defect in virion assembly after IFITM suppression. all three forms of nuclear capsids could be detected in the presence or absence of IFITMs. the numbers of A and C capsids were actually increased after IFITM knockdown. MRC5 cells were transduced with shC- or sh8025-expressing lentiviruses. cells were fixed at 96 hpi and prepared for electron microscopy. a capsids (white arrow), B capsids (white arrowhead) and C capsids (white arrowhead with a black border) are indicated. the area in the square box in panel C is shown at a higher magnification in panel C. the area in the square box in panel E is shown at a further increased magnification in panel E. different forms of virion particles and dense bodies are indicated with arrows of different styles. the known function of IFITMs in virus infection is related to virus entry, which is a very early step of the virus life cycle. the detailed mechanism has remained elusive, although it occurs via inhibition of the membrane fusion step of virus entry. HCMV infection drastically suppresses IFITM protein accumulation at the late stage of virus infection. IFITM3 disrupts intracellular cholesterol homeostasis by interfering with the interaction between vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP)-associated protein A (VAPA) and oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP) the formation of the HCMV vAC involves a drastic reorganization of intracellular organelles. transport are likely involved in vAC maturation (60, 61)."}
