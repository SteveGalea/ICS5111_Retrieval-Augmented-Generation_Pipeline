{"summary": "the coVs are a large family of enveloped, plus-RNA viruses. they are involved in respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neuronal infectious diseases in animals and humans. they are involved in respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neuronal infectious diseases in animals and humans. there is considerable variability in receptor usage among the coVs. most Alphacoronavirus such as TGEV and HCoV-229E use APN [9], [10], whereas the related HCoV-NL63 uses a distinct cell entry receptor, the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11]. coV recognition of APN is species-specific, and specificity is associated with N-linked glycosylations in the APN protein [20]. both viruses use porcine APN (pAPN) for cell entry. most TGEV-neutralizing antibodies cluster at antigenic site A [25], [26]. an anti-HA mAb that binds to the HA tag in the SA protein was used as control. an anti-HA mAb that binds to the HA tag in the SA protein was used as control. there is no structural information available on antibody neutralization. pAPN-binding domain was mapped within residues 506 to 655 of the mature TGEV S polypeptide [22], whereas TGEV mAb-resistant mutants defined four antigenic sites (C, B, D and A) [24], [26]. antigenic sites C and B are not present in the PRCV S protein. crystals were prepared with the pAPN-binding SA protein in complex with a TGEV-neutralizing mAb. the structure of the complex was determined and refined using diffraction data extending to 3.0 resolution (Materials and Methods; Table 1). crystal structures contain two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Ligands include two acetate molecules in the TGEV RBD-1AF10 structure and zinc ions in the pAPN structure. buried surface of 1AF10 mAb is 750 2, with equal contribution by the VH (51%) and VL (49%) Ig domains. buried surface of 1AF10 mAb is 750 2. the RBD 1\u20132 hairpin with Tyr528 at its tip is at the center of the interacting surface and penetrates between the VL and VH Ig domains of the 1AF10 mAb. similar antibody-antigen recognition is described for some peptides and is common for small hapten molecules. -L1 and CDR-L3 of the VL domain, whereas the 5\u20136 loop contacts the long CDR-H3 loop. crystals were obtained only with a mixture of a PRCV S protein (S3H) and the pAPN. each pAPN molecule was engaged by the tip of a single PRCV RBD molecule. the PRCV RBD-pAPN complex is bound to the pAPN ectodomain. ribbon drawings of the pAPN molecules are shown with domains (D) in orange (N-terminal DI), yellow (DII), red (DIII) and green (C-terminal DIV), and the N-terminal end (n) near the cell membrane. the pAPN is a type II membrane protein and the N-terminal end of the ectodomain must be near the cell membrane. the 25 N-terminal residues of the crystallized pAPN ectodomain are largely disordered in the structure and they might form a flexible region close to the cell membrane. pAPN dimeric assembly showed in Figure 3A buried a large accessible surface (980 2) in each monomer. dimerization surface comprises 29 residues spread across domain IV. similar dimeric assemblies were observed in two crystal structures determined for the pAPN ectodomain alone. the end of the pAPN helix 19 and helix 21 contacted the 1\u20132 region of the RBD. the Tyr side chain (Tyr528 in TGEV) protrudes at the -turn in PRCV and TGEV RBDs. the hydroxyl group of the RBD Tyr528 was hydrogen bonded to side chains. pAPN cavity formed by coils that precede helices 22 in domain IV and 5 in domain II. the bulky side chain of the RBD Trp571 residue packed against pAPN residues His786 and Pro787 was hydrogen bonded to the main chain carbonyl of Asn783. mutant TGEV RBD proteins also abolished TGEV RBD binding to cell surface-expressed pAPN. TGEV and PRCV RBDs have -barrel structures with small differences in the ligand binding loops. the bent -strand 5 (5) crosses both -sheets and has a -bulge at Asn608 (Figure 5A, magenta). N- and C-terminal ends of the RBD are opposite the ligand-binding tip of the -barrel. the pAPN-binding Tyr and Trp residues in the loops at the -barrel domain tip are indicated in lowercase letters. receptor-binding residues for TGEV are colored as in C. the thrombin recognition sequence at the end of the TGEV RBD is in lowercase letters. ACE2 receptor-binding HCoV-NL63 -barrel domains are structurally similar. the receptor-binding loops at the tip appear to have a different conformation from TGEV in the HCoV-229E RBD. in this CoV, the 1\u20132 region has two Cys, as in HCoV-NL63. the 3\u20134 loop in HCoV-229E is markedly shorter than in TGEV. the pAPN-binding edge of the TGEV RBD is the main determinant of antigenic site A. the most TGEV-neutralizing mAbs, including 1AF10, recognize antigenic site A in the S protein. antigenic site A in the TGEV RBD and epitopes for antibodies. three antibody-binding residues (Tyr528, Trp571 and Asn632) in the loops at the RBD tip. lines indicate epitopes for mAbs specific for each of the three antigenic subsites. site A epitopes extend across the TGEV RBD tip. epitopes for the Ac-specific mAbs bear the exposed TGEV Trp571 residue at the 3\u20134 loop. epitopes for the Ac-specific mAbs center on Tyr528 in the 1\u20132 turn. antigenic sites C and B are not present in the PRCV S protein. we produced a recombinant short S protein fragment called SA. it comprises only residues 481 to 650 of the TGEV S protein. the structure of the crystals was determined and refined using diffraction data extending to 3.0 resolution. the asymmetric unit of the crystals contains two antibody-RBD complexes. they folded in a single domain structure, the RBD of TGEV. crystal structures contain two independent molecules in the asymmetric unit. Ligands include two acetate molecules in the TGEV RBD-1AF10 structure and zinc ions in the pAPN structure, one in each molecule of the asymmetric unit. buried surface of 1AF10 mAb is 750 2, with equal contribution by the VH (51%) and VL (49%) Ig domains. buried surface of 1AF10 mAb is 750 2, with equal contribution by the VH (51%) and VL (49%) Ig domains. the RBD 1\u20132 region contributed 73% of the RBD surface buried by the 1AF10 mAb. the -turn is fully buried between the mAb variable domains. the -turn is fully buried between the mAb Ig domains. crystals were obtained only with a mixture of a PRCV S protein (S3H) and the pAPN. the asymmetric unit of the crystals contained two macromolecular RBD-pAPN complexes. each pAPN molecule was engaged by the tip of a single PRCV RBD molecule. the RBD is shown as ribbon and surface drawings in blue and cyan. the pAPN-binding Tyr and Trp residues at the RBD tip in red. location of the remaining CoV S is indicated at the RBD terminal end. lized pAPN ectodomain are largely disordered in the structure. domain I (orange) is made of -strands, domain II (yellow) adopts a thermolysin-like fold bearing a zinc ion at the catalytic site. domain III (red) is a small -barrel domain, and the C-terminal domain IV (green) is composed of alpha-helices. the dimerization surface comprises 29 residues spread across domain IV, which are distinct from those recognized by CoV. similar dimeric assemblies were observed in two crystal structures determined for the pAPN ectodomain alone. the pAPN molecular assembly may thus be representative of the dimer described for mammalian APN on membrane surfaces. the hydroxyl group of the RBD Tyr528 was hydrogen bonded to side chains of pAPN residues Glu731 and Trp737. the preceding RBD Gly527 residue was at the pAPN proximal side of the -turn, hydrogen bonded to the pAPN Asn736 main chain. at the opposite side, the RBD Gln530 side chain formed a network of hydrogen bond interactions with pAPN NAG7361 and glycan-binding Tyr528 at the -barrel tip in TGEV and PRCV appear to be central residues in the virus-receptor interaction, as they contact with many pAPN residues. mutations outside the receptor-binding region (V617Ngly) also abolished TGEV RBD binding to cell surface-expressed pAPN. TGEV and PRCV RBDs adopt -barrel structures with small differences in the ligand binding loops. the bent -strand 5 (5) crosses both -sheets and has a -bulge at Asn608. the pAPN-binding RBD of TGEV is in blue and the ACE2-binding RBD of HCoV-NL63 (PDB ID 3KBH) is in orange. the thrombin recognition sequence at the end of the TGEV RBD is in lowercase letters. the tip region of the HCoV-NL63 RBD is the ACE2 receptor-binding edge. aromatic residues protrude from the -turns at the tip of the -barrel in TGEV. the distinct RBD tip conformation in HCoV-NL63 and in APN-binding TGEV might be a determinant of their distinct cell entry receptor specificities. the 3\u20134 loop in HCoV-229E is markedly shorter than in TGEV. but it also has a Trp residue. similarities are found mostly in -strands and at the RBD C-terminal half. the most TGEV-neutralizing mAbs, including 1AF10, recognize antigenic site A in the S protein, divided into the Aa, Ab and Ac subsites [24]. to further characterize site A antigenic determinants in the TGEV RBD, we mutated RBD residues targeted by the 1AF10 mAb (Figure 2) and some surrounding residues. lines indicate epitopes for mAbs specific for each of the three antigenic subsites. Aa in yellow, Ab in green and Ac in red. mAb 6AC3 recognizes a broader epitope, which correlates with its higher TGEV neutralization activity. epitopes for the Ac-specific mAbs bear the exposed TGEV Trp571 residue at the 3\u20134 loop. none of the mAbs tested simultaneously targeted the two aromatic side chains at the tip of the TGEV RBD that bind to the pAPN. subsite-specific residues defined by mar mutants may be located at the periphery of their respective epitopes. glycan is also engaged in the virus-receptor interaction. the inherent flexibility of this glycan might facilitate the initial contact of the CoV Tyr residue with APN amino acids. the glycan N-linked to Asn736 in pAPN is also conserved in canine and feline APN proteins. the receptor-binding region of Alphacoronavirus is under selective pressure from the immune system. it is tempting to speculate that immune pressure on exposed receptor-binding residues in the CoV S could lead to conformational changes in receptor-binding edges of CoV RBDs. this would result either in changes in the APN-recognition mode observed with HCoV-229E and TGEV, or in conformational changes in the RBD tip that lead to a receptor specificity the receptor-binding region is the major antigenic site in the Alphacoronavirus envelope S. we have identified the receptor-binding region as the major antigenic site in the Alphacoronavirus envelope S. soluble S proteins variants of TGEV and PRCV have been described. proteins secreted to culture supernatants were initially purified by affinity chromatography. all protein samples were further purified by size exclusion chromatography. Fab fragment of the 1AF10 mAb was prepared by papain digestion. tively expressing cell surface pAPN were used for binding experiments comparing wild type and mutant pAPN glycosylation mutants. transiently transfected 293T cells were used for analysis of RBD binding to pAPN glycosylation mutants. pAPN binding ratios for wild type and mutant pAPN proteins shown in Figure 4A were determined from the percentage of cells stained with same concentration of wild type and mutant SA-Fc proteins. in complex with porcine coV S proteins was carried out with mixtures of receptor protein and several TGEV and PRCV protein variants. crystals appeared only in trials performed with an equimolar mixture of pAPN and the S3H protein derived from the PRCV S at a final protein concentration of 13 mg/ml. crystals were transferred to crystallization solution containing 20% ethylene glycol and frozen for diffraction data collection at the ID29 beamline. MR solutions were obtained for the two pAPN molecules (chains A and B) and for one RBD molecule (chain E) the three molecules were adjusted manually and refined with the phenix.refine program. the second RBD molecule (chain F) bound to pAPN molecule B was built manually into the electron density map. Figure 2D was prepared with LIGPLOT (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/software/LIGPLOT/), Figure 5A with Ribbons and the other structure representations with PyMOL (pymol.org) Accession numbers of the Alphacoronavirus S proteins mentioned are Q0PKZ5 (TGEV), Q65984 (CCoV), P10033 (FCoV), P15423 (HCoV-229), Q6 pAPN was derived from the PRCV HOL87 strain (S3H in [27]. a recombinant membrane bound pAPN with an HA tag at the C-terminal end was engineered for cell surface expression. Thrombin recognition sequences were introduced between the tags and the viral or pAPN protein sequences. the SA-Fc fusion proteins in serum-free (opti-MEM, Invitrogen) cell supernatants were bound to plastic. at least four SA-Fc protein concentrations ranging from 10 to 1 g/ml were used in duplicate and average binding determined in each experiment. crystals were prepared by the hanging drop method with a 20 mg/ml protein sample and a crystallization solution of 16% PEG-4K, 0.2 M NaAc, 0.1 M 1,2,3-octanetriol isomer T and 0.1 M Tris buffer pH 8.5. diffraction data extending to 3 resolution were collected at the ID29 beamline (TGEV RBD-1AF10 in Table 1). structure refinement of complex was carried out with data extending to 3.0 resolution. three cycles of solvent correction, refinement of individual coordinates and atomic displacement parameters combined with TLS were applied in each step of structure refinement. residues are in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. all the residues are in allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot. coordinates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank with ID codes 4F2M and 4F5C. a -bulge at the -strand 5 is shown in magenta, helix with a red cylinder, coils with black lines, and disulphide bonds with green lines. a stereo view of the superimposed asymmetric unit RBD structures of TGEV (blue and cyan), complex with the 1AF10 mAb. the glutamic acid located in the GAMEN motif is labeled in blue and those located at the conserved HExxHx18E motif are in red. pAPN protein was run through a superdex 200 16/60 column with HEPES-saline buffer pH 7.5.
