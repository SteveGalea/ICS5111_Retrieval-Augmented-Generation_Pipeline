{"summary": "the introduction porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), an Arterivirus, emerged in the late 1980s in the united states and Europe. it quickly spread worldwide and became enzootic among pig populations in most countries [24]. the virus strongly modulates host immune responses and changes host gene expression patterns. anti-PRRSV effects of the mineral have not yet been examined. pigs were randomly divided into three groups of eight mice each. mice were randomly divided into three groups of eight mice each. the control group received a commercial and nutritionally complete swine feed. the experiment group received the same swine feed supplemented with 0.3% (w/w) GB. all animals were housed in an air-controlled separate room and allowed free access to tap water and their particular diets. L lipopolysaccharide (LPS; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were added into each well of a 96-well plate (SPL Life Sciences, Korea) the cultures were set up in duplicate. after 48-h incubation, 20 L of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 5 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) experimental PRRSV infection of pigs All pigs were fed the experimental or control diet for 2 weeks before being experimentally infected with the virus. the rectal temperatures of pigs were measured at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 21, 24, and 28 days post-infection. each suspension was serially diluted 10-fold in alpha-MEM (Welgene, Korea) containing 2% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Lonza, Switzerland) each dilution was used to inoculate confluent monolayers of MARC-145 cells prepared in a 6-well plate. the cells were incubated with the inoculum in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with manual rocking every 10 min. the presence and severity of type 2 pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, alveolar septal infiltration by inflammatory cells, peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia, volume of alveolar exudate, and degree of inflammation in the lamina propria of the bronchi and bronchioles were scored on a scale ranging from 06 (0, normal; 1, mild lymphoid depletion with loss of overall cellularity; 2, moderate lymphoid de a t-test was performed to analyze data from the swine experiments. a Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare microscopic lesion scores (ordinal data) for tissues from the experimentally PRRSV-infected pigs. the experiment group received the same swine feed supplemented with 0.3% (w/w) GB. all animals were housed in an air-controlled separate room. all animal procedures were approved (no. CNU IACUC-YB-2010-1) the cultures were set up in duplicate. 20 L of 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT, 5 mg/mL; Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were added to each well. experimental PRRSV infection of pigs All pigs were fed the experimental or control diet for 2 weeks before being experimentally infected with the virus. the rectal temperatures of pigs were measured at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 21, 24, and 28 days post-infection. each suspension was serially diluted 10-fold in alpha-MEM (Welgene, Korea) containing 2% (v/v) antibiotic-antimycotic solution (Lonza, Switzerland) each dilution was used to inoculate confluent monolayers of MARC-145 cells prepared in a 6-well plate. the cells were incubated with the inoculum in 5% CO2 at 37\u00b0C for 1 h with manual rocking every 10 min. the presence and severity of type 2 pneumocyte hypertrophy and hyperplasia, alveolar septal infiltration by inflammatory cells, peribronchial lymphoid hyperplasia, volume of alveolar exudate, and degree of inflammation in the lamina propria of the bronchi and bronchioles were scored on a scale ranging from 06 (0, normal; 1, mild lymphoid depletion with loss of overall cellularity; 2, moderate lymphoid de student's t-test was performed to analyze data from the swine experiments. a Mann-Whitney U test was also used to compare microscopic lesion scores (ordinal data) for tissues from the experimentally PRRSV-infected pigs. 1.60% for the 0.1% and 0.3% GB-fed groups were significantly increased (p 0.001) compared to those observed in the control group (9.63 0.61%). however, no significant differences in the percentages of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes in the spleen were observed among the groups. viral titers of lungs and lymphoid tissues from both groups were almost under the limit of detection (10 pfu/g tissue) at 12 DPI, the viral titer of lung (LUN) tissues from the 0.3% GB-fed pigs was significantly decreased compared to that for the control group (*p 0.05). pigs fed 0.3% GB (B) had milder cases of interstitial pneumonia at 12 DPI compared to the control animals (*p 0.05). pigs fed 0.3% GB (B) had milder cases of interstitial pneumonia at 12 DPI (based on lung histopathological features) compared to the control animals (*p 0.05). effects of germanium biotite (GB) on lymphocyte proliferation in mice. effects of GB on T lymphocyte subpopulations in mice. the percentage of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes in the spleens of GB-fed mice was significantly increased compared to that observed for the control group (***p 0.001). however, no significant difference in the percentage of spleen CD3+CD4+ T lymphocytes was observed among the groups. viral titers of lymphoid tissues including bronchial lymph node, tonsil, and thymus were also significantly decreased (p 0.05) in the GB-fed group. however, viral titers of lungs and lymphoid tissues from both groups were almost under the limit of detection (10 pfu/g tissue) at 28 DPI. pigs fed 0.3% GB (B) had milder cases of interstitial pneumonia at 12 DPI compared to the control animals (A) pigs fed 0.3% GB (B) had milder cases of interstitial pneumonia at 12 DPI. pigs fed 0.3% GB (B) had milder cases of interstitial pneumonia at 12 DPI (based on lung histopathological features) compared to the control animals (A). the CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte ratio was significantly increased in the spleens of mice fed GB compared to those of the control group. dietary supplementation with GB mainly affects CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes. the antiviral activities of GB may be related to the CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte stimulatory effects observed in the mice. dietary supplementation with GB primarily stimulates CD3+CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation in mice and expedites the clearance of PRRSV in experimentally infected pigs."}
