{"summary": "66 CSF specimens were available for virus isolation on 3 cell lines. cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 50 U/mL of penicillin and 50 g/mL of streptomycin. positive isolates were designated Echo30-FDJS03, which was abbreviated as FDJS03. each positive strain was tested by a neutralization assay, according to standard procedures (16) viral titers were simultaneously determined. two sets of amplification primers (12\u201314), UG52 (sense, 5 -CAAGCACTTCTGTTTCCCCGG-3, nucleotides [nt] 168\u2013188, Bastianni) and primer 2 (sense, 5 -TCCTCCGGCCCCCG-3, nt 445\u2013464, coxsackie B1) were used to produce PCR products of 440 (UG52/UC53) and 155 (primer2/UC53 DNA sequencing was performed by using an automated DNA sequencer (ABI 3730, Applied Biosytems, Foster City, CA, USA) each RT-PCR product was sequenced in both directions to resolve possible ambiguous nucleotides. nucleotide sequence homology was inferred by the identity scores obtained with the BLASTn program. 66 CSF specimens were available for virus isolation on 3 cell lines. cells were grown in minimal essential medium (MEM) supplemented with 10% newborn calf serum, 50 U/mL of penicillin, and 50 g/mL of streptomycin. merase chain reaction (RT-PCR) with 2 pairs of enterovirus general primers (12\u201314), which detect nearly all types of enterovirus (12,15) positive isolates were designated Echo30-FDJS03, which was abbreviated as FDJS03. each positive strain was tested by a neutralization assay, according to standard procedures (16), and viral titers were simultaneously determined. the highly conserved 5 untranslated region (UTR) was used to detect enterovirus by PCR amplification (17). two sets of amplification primers (12\u201314), UG52 (sense, 5 -CAAGCACTTCTGTTTCCCCGG-3, nucleotides [nt] 168\u2013188, Bastianni) and primer 2 (sense, 5 -TCCTCCCCCCCCGG-3, nt 445\u2013464, coxsackie DNA sequencing was performed by using an automated DNA sequencer. each RT-PCR product was sequenced in both directions to resolve possible ambiguous nucleotides. serotypes of the viral isolates were determined by comparing their complete VP1 sequences with those available in the GenBank database. treeview 1.6.6 (University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom) was used to edit phylogenetic trees. the echovirus 30 sequences reported have been deposited in the GenBank database under accession nos. AY665606\u2013AY665609. the isolates were totally neutralized by monoclonal antibody to echovirus 30. the other antibodies did not show neutralization. this finding suggests that all 18 positive strains were echovirus 30. cluster serotype FDJS03_18 FDJS03_73 FDJS03_102 nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa nt aa HEV-A CA3 46 34 46 34 46 34 34 32 CA5 47 34 47 34 34 47 34 CA6 47 33 47 33 47 33 47 33 33 47 33 CA12 46 33 46 33 46 33 46 33 46 33 46 phylogenetic analysis was conducted on complete VP1 nucleotide sequences. the tree constructed by the neighbor-joining method is highly similar to that produced by maximum parsimony method. FDJS03 isolates were monophyletic and closely related to each other, which suggests a common origin. prototype strain Bastianni and strains isolated before 1977 were distributed in 2 distinct genotypes (groups 1 and 2), which may have become extinct in recent years (9,18). the tree based on complete VP1 sequences among FDJS03 isolates and other strains of echovirus 30 from different geographic and temporal origins was used to construct the tree. numbers at the nodes represent the percentage of 100 bootstrap pseudoreplicates that contained clusters distal to the node. study is the first to show that a distinct lineage of echovirus 30 caused meningitis in china. this finding is an important addition to the worldwide echovirus 30 information database. the temporal dynamics of echovirus 30 were seen both in Europe and North America, but until now no study reported the corresponding dynamics in Asia. however, pairwise comparison of nucleotide sequences and phylogenetic tree analysis demonstrated that the VP1 sequences of FDJS03 isolates exist in a subcluster composed of sequences from viruses isolated in north America in the early 1980s."}
