{"summary": "IFNs enhance HCoV-OC43 infection of cells derived from human respiratory tract epithelia and hepatocytes. all three types of IFNs (IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-) enhanced HCoV-OC43 infection of the human lung cancer cell line NCI-H520. cell nuclei were visualized by immunofluorescence (IF) staining of HCoV-OC43 N protein (green). HCoV-OC43 nuvcleoprotein, IFITM, and MxA were determined by Western blot. 49, NCI-H460, and NCI-H520 cells were mock-infected or infected with the indicated MOI of HCoV-OC43. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed, and virally infected cells were visualized by immunofluorescence staining of HCoV-OC43 N protein (green). cell nuclei were visualized by DAPI staining. expression of IFITM3 effectively promoted not only the initial infection from in knockdown of basal expression of IFITM2 and/or IFITM3, but not IFITM1, significantly inhibited HCoV-OC43 infection. ectopic expression of human IFITM2 or 3, but not IFITM1, in NCI-H520 cells significantly enhanced HCoV-OC43 infection, lowering basal expression of IFITM2 and/or IFITM3 in human hepatoma cells. viral nucleoprotein, IFITMs, and viral RNA were determined at 24 hpi. intracellular viral RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. differences in viral RNA between scramble or IFITM-specific shRNA-expressing cells were analyzed statistically. expression of human IFITM 2 or 3 and mouse IFITM 1 or 3 in Huh7.5 cells increased the infection efficiency of HCoV-OC43 envelope protein pseudotyped lentiviral particles (HCoV-OC43pp) by more than 100-fold. expression of human IFITM1 or mouse IFITM2 only modestly enhanced or apparently did not alter the susceptibility of Huh7.5 cells to HCoV-OC43pp infection. luciferase assay measured luciferase infection at 48 hpi. relative infection represents the luciferase activity normalized to that of cells expressing scramble shRNA. differences in relative pseudovirus infection between scramble and IFITM-specific shRNA-expressing cells were statistically analyzed. HCoV-OC43 binds to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid receptors to agglutinate mouse, rat, and avian erythrocytes. a synchronized infection assay was performed in the absence or presence of NH4Cl. hpi was undetectable within 6 h postinfection. expression of IFITM3 shortened the elapsed time of viral RNA amplification by 3 h. NH4Cl treatment delayed the onset of viral RNA amplification by 6 h. deletion of the N-terminal 21-aa residue unique to IFITM2 or 3 significantly impaired its ability to inhibit IAV entry (12, 18), the deletion apparently did not affect its ability to enhance HCoV-OC43pp infection. mouse IFITM1, which lacks the N-terminal extension, efficiently enhances HCoV-OC43pp infection but only modestly inhibits IAVpp infection. cycline-inducibly express CAT or indicated IFITM protein were cultured in the presence of 1 g/mL of tetracycline for 24 h. expression of flag-tag IFITMs was detected by Western blot assay using anti-Flag mAb. we swapped the corresponding regions of the two resulting chimeric proteins. expression of human IFITM1 slightly enhanced HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-OC43pp infection of Huh7.5 cells. ectopic expression in 293 cells that express high basal levels of IFITM proteins significantly inhibited HCoV-OC43pp infection. expression of IFITM3 with F75A and F78A mutations failed to inhibit IAVpp infection. IFITM oligomerization is required for both enhancing and inhibiting virus entry. evidence suggesting that IFITM proteins function as homo- or hetero-oligomers. luciferase activities were determined at 48 hpi. all three types of IFNs (IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-) enhanced HCoV-OC43 infection of the human lung cancer cell line NCI-H520 (Fig. 1) and the hepatoma cell line Huh7.5 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1) in a dose-dependent manner. cytokines modestly inhibited HCoV-OC43 infection of another human lung cancer cell line A549. HCoV-OC43 nucleoprotein, IFITM, and MxA were determined by Western blot. intracellular viral RNA was quantified by quantitative RT-PCR. differences in viral RNA between IFN- and mock-treated cells are statistically significant (P 0.001) cell nuclei were visualized by immunofluorescence staining of HCoV-OC43 N protein (green) expression of IFITM protein in the five cell lines was determined by a Western blot assay with a polyclonal antibody against IFITM3, which efficiently recognizes IFITM2 and weakly cross-reacts with IFITM1. expression of IFITM3 effectively promoted not only the initial infection from inocula but also cell-to-cell spreading of ectopic expression of human IFITM2 or 3, but not IFITM1, in NCI-H520 cells significantly enhanced HCoV-OC43 infection. ectopic expression of human IFITM2 or 3, but not IFITM1, in NCI-H520 cells significantly enhanced HCoV-OC43 infection. intracellular viral RNA was quantified by qRT-PCR. differences in viral RNA between scramble or IFITM-specific shRNA-expressing cells were analyzed statistically. we hypothesize that these IFN-induced proteins may be host factors that facilitate the entry of HCoV-OC43. infection efficiency of HCoV-OC43 envelope protein pseudotyped lentiviral particles (HCoV-OC43pp) by more than 100-fold. expression of human or mouse IFITM proteins only modestly enhanced or apparently did not alter the susceptibility of Huh7.5 cells to HCoV-OC43pp infection. relative infection represents the luciferase activity normalized to that of cells expressing scramble shRNA. differences in relative pseudovirus infection between scramble and IFITM-specific shRNA-expressing cells were statistically analyzed. FITM3 with antibodies against IFITM3 or the N-terminal Flag tag did not affect the attachment of and infection by HCoV-OC43. HCoV-OC43 binds to 9-O-acetylated sialic acid\u2013containing receptors to agglutinate mouse, rat, and avian erythrocytes (16), the specific receptor molecules that mediate the infectious entry of the virus remain to be identified (1). NH4Cl treatment delayed the onset of viral RNA amplification by 6 h and reduced viral RNA levels by more than 10-fold at 24 hpi in both IFITM3-expressing and -nonexpressing Huh7.5 cells. results clearly indicate that, like SARS-CoV, HCoV-OC43 enters host cells by an acid-dependent endosomal route. treatment of cells with amphotericin B, an antibiotic that alters the structure and fluid deletion apparently did not affect its ability to inhibit IAV entry (12, 18) mouse IFITM1, which lacks the N-terminal extension, efficiently enhances HCoV-OC43pp infection but only modestly inhibits IAVpp infection. expression of flag-tag IFITMs was detected by western blot assay. we swapped the corresponding regions of the two proteins. IFITM1EX2 and IFITM3EX2 inhibited HCoV-OC43 entry. ectopic expression in HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-OC43pp infection of Huh7.5 cells significantly inhibited HCoV-OC43pp infection. the gene-swapping experiments showed that the C-terminal variable region of IFITM1 is the key determinant of the inhibitory effect, as judged by IFITM3EX2 inhibition. luciferase activity normalized to cells transduced with empty vector. differences in pseudovirus infection between cells expressing IFITM and cells transduced by empty vector were statistically analyzed. cytomegalovirus hijacks BST-2/tetherin to promote its entry into host cells and co-opts viperin to facilitate its replication. in principle, IFN enhancement of a viral infection can occur only when a virus hijacks one or several IFN-induced proteins or pathways to promote its replication. three possible membrane topologies had been proposed for IFITM proteins. but it was demonstrated that only its short C terminus is exposed on the cell surface or lumen of endosomes and thus potentially can interact with viral envelopes. the proper S-palmitoylation and ubiquitination of IFITM3 are required for both inhibition of IAV infection and enhancement of HCoV-OC43 infection. we further extended this observation to show that these residues also are required for IFITM3 to enhance HCoV-OC43 infection. the specificity of IFITM modulation of virus entry is determined by recruitment of IFITMs to specified membrane microdomains. this recruitment efficiently homes the IFITMs to a location where they can block the entry of multiple viruses that use lipid rafts for viral fusion without needing to interact with the host receptor of each virus. a likely explanation for this phenomenon is that HCoV-OC43 may not induce a robust IFN response in vivo and normally is controlled by other branches of host innate and adaptive immune responses. a likely explanation for this phenomenon is that HCoV-OC43 may not induce a robust IFN response in vivo and normally is controlled by other branches of host innate and adaptive immune responses. ing of viral and pseudoviral particle infection, and protein and RNA analyses are provided in SI Appendix, Materials and Methods."}
