RNA in situ hybridization is a method of identifying the mRNA transcriptional expression pattern within the cytoplasm by hybridizing the sequence of interest to a labeled probe. the expression of the HEPIS gene in cancer and adjacent normal tissues in 12 organs was assessed using RNA in situ hybridization with a specific digoxigenin-labelled probe. however, the expression of the HEPIS gene in other types of cell lines remains unknown. luciferase activity varied between pHEPIS-1.3k and pHEPIS-1.1k. no significant changes in luciferase activity were observed following truncation of the 1334/1203 bp and 1203/1060 bp regions. however, no significant changes in luciferase activity were observed. these findings provide further insight into the expression profile and the mechanism of HEPIS gene transcriptional regulation. HEPIS has different expression levels in cancer and normal tissues."}
