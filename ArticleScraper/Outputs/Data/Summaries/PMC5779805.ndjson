{"summary": "the notifications of each infection were aggregated into weekly case counts. the number of hospital laboratories in the sentinel network varied from six in 1996 to seven in 2008. the number of hospital laboratories in the sentinel network varied from six in 1996 to seven in 2008. x i is an influenza count, the IRR is the ratio of the risk associated with a count of x i + 1 compared to the risk for a count of x i. the IRR for a count of x i + n compared to x i is IRRn. the spline function used had six knots 29 and therefore five parameters. all analyses were carried out with stata 10.1 (Stata Corp., Cary, NC, USA) the data used are all publicly available aggregate surveillance results. no ethical review was required. time series of weekly numbers of positive tests for influenza A and B, Montr\u00e9al, 1996\u20132008. correlations between weekly influenza counts and later bacterial counts were generally high, as expected. only two IRR, between influenza B and subsequent S. pyogenes infections, approach significance. 9344 09660 1 10080 10354b 10228 10195 2 10034 09753 10123 09726 3 10056 09808 10001 09069c 4 09860 09875 10233 10908d 5 10102 09998 09930 10143 Number of weeks 596 644 644 644. a model containing influenza B counts for all 6 weeks does not show a better fit than one containing only the counts for weeks 0 and 1 (deviance = 6.96, P = 0.1381) this apparent \u2018harvesting\u2019 of cases may well be in fact random variations in the parameters. the regression coefficients and the bounds of their confidence intervals have been transformed into incidence rate. the regression coefficients and the bounds of their confidence intervals have been transformed into incidence rate. the first 5 weeks are excluded from the analysis, as influenza B counts for earlier weeks up to 5 are unavailable for them. the comparison of observed and expected S. pyogenes counts before and after influenza counts are added to the model (4, 5). the improvement is greater for S. pneumoniae than for S. pyogenes. when seasonality is also controlled for by dedicated terms, however, the only effect remaining is that of influenza B counts on S. pyogenes counts. this effect remains the same if one uses Poisson regression. the association between two phenomena that share a seasonal pattern is intrinsically difficult to interpret as causal. the association that have resisted such control provides the clearest information about true effects, in the absence of data on specific confounders. the reported incidence of invasive bacterial infections better reflects their true incidence, especially for those caused by N. meningitidis and S. pyogenes. the effects observed over weeks 0 and 1 probably occurred after only a few days. both types of influenza have been associated with secondary infections and an increased risk of mortality, 33. the risk associated with type B has been less well documented than for type A. influenza infected hosts boost an invasive type of Streptococcus pyogenes infection in mice. s JA.
