{"summary": "the cyclic nature of cyclodextrins was postulated in 1939. it was not until 1948, with the adequate purification and crystal structure resolution of each of the native cyclodextrins, that their composition was accurately defined. applications in pharmaceutical, cosmetic, and food chemistry have blossomed. in all of these products, cyclodextrins were essentially regarded as excipients or inert materials. in all of these products, cyclodextrins were essentially regarded as excipients or inert materials. the EMA recommends against the administration of -CD and -CD directly into the bloodstream due to renal toxicity. native CDs can be functionalized to afford a large variety and number of derivatives, surpassing 1500 different molecules according to a report of 2012. only a few are approved for human use in the fields of pharmaceutics. RAMEB (from randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin) has some hydrolytical action on erythrocytes. it has an average of 1.8 methoxyl groups per glucose unit. for these reasons, RAMEB is not recommended for parenteral use by the EMA [15] the cyclic nature of cyclodextrins was postulated in 1939. it was not until 1948, with the adequate purification and crystal structure resolution of each of the native cyclodextrins, that their composition was accurately defined. cyclodextrins were found to protect sensitive organic guest molecules from volatilization and from oxidation. developments in cyclodextrin biomedical research have surprised the scientific community by demonstrating that these molecules are not quite so inert and they may, in fact, be used to treat some human ailments. in western countries, the ingestion of native cyclodextrins is regulated by the JECFA (Joint WHO/FAO Expert Committee on Food Additives) the fda lists 2-hydroxypropyl--cyclodextrin (HPCD) and 2-hydroxypropyl--CD (HPCD) as approved inert materials. heptakis-2,3,6-tris-O-methyl-CD (TRIMEB) is deemed unsafe for human use. sulfobutyl ether -CD (SBECD) developed to be non-nephrotoxic and present in several FDA-approved marketed medications for both oral and intravenous administration. the early steps Cyclodextrins were, for many years, regarded as excipients with solubilizing and stabilizing properties. cyclodextrins are able to bind to cholesterol, but those with a higher sequestering ability are -CD and RAMEB, followed by HPCD and then TRIMEB. the high biocompatibility of HPCD makes it the cyclodextrin of choice for medicinal applications that require cholesterol sequestering. the rhesus macaque was treated with HPCD by intravaginal administration. the animals were then subjected to SIV contact, with HPCD protecting them from infection upon first contact with the virus. however, repeating the viral inoculation 11 or 47 weeks later, also under treatment with HPCD, led to large-scale infection. the terpenic -CD derivatives were the most potent, with IC50 values as low as 4.7 M against virus cultivated inside canine epithelial kidney cells. their mechanism of action is to bind and block hemagglutinin, a protein on the virus surface, thus preventing its interaction with the host receptor and the entry of the virus into the host cells. if successful, it will be the first cyclodextrin-adjuvanted vaccine in history. it will be the first cyclodextrin-adjuvanted vaccine in history. the ability of these CDs to reduce viral infectivity has already been demonstrated against several common viruses. the ability of these CDs to reduce viral infectivity has already been demonstrated against several common viruses. administration of an aqueous solution of HPCD (c.a. 320 M), which corresponds to 448 mg/L, caused a 21% reduction of liver infection when compared to the control [64], studies demonstrating its effectiveness in reducing the infectivity of L. donovani and its ability to infect the immune cells of the host. there is also a patent on the leishmanicidal use of RAMEB. the potency of the activity of each cyclodextrin derivative seems to be related to the degree of substitution. the most potent compound was the sodium salt of a poly-sulphated -cyclodextrin with 16.9 sulphate groups (per CD molecule), the highest average degree of sulphation tested. this derivative exhibited an IC50 value of 2.4 0.3 M against P. falciparum. treating contaminated water with -CD (25 g/L) for 24 h allowed a reduction of the load of infection in mice by 77% compared to mice exposed to the same amount of contaminated water that was not treated with -CD. a single daily dose of 500 mg/kg of body weight was shown to reduce both the clinical symptoms and the intensity of infection in the lambs. -CD is quite safe, it has no dietary intake limits, and is already used as a nutraceutical in beverages. in a scenario of cryptosporidiosis-caused diarrhea, -CD-containing beverages would be most adequate as they would ameliorate both dehydration and infection. a group of 75 healthy volunteers focused on oral administration of a daily dose of 6 mg for 12 weeks. no significant beneficial changes in the profile of plasma lipids were observed. the effects of the cyclodextrin in blocking the absorption of dietary lipids were not measured in this study. the lack of medication against NPC encouraged the search for innovative medication to remove lipid deposits in the brains of these patients. it was concluded that HPCD is unable to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier [84] and that in order to treat NPD, it needs to be administered directly into the spinal canal. a total of nine currently active clinical trials with HPCD [92] are currently underway. they involve a large number and variety of medical institutions around the globe. they will help elucidate the role of HPCD, its long-term toxicological safety and its biological fate. rocuronium bromide, one of the most used drugs for surgeries requiring tracheal intubation, was chosen as model drug and a -CD derivative was designed for maximum inclusion affinity. the new derivative, called sugammadex, is obtained by perfunctionalization of the primary hydroxyl side of -CD with sulphanylpropanoic acid. sugammadex forms a very stable complex with rocuronium. it is estimated that for every 25 million sugammadexrocuronium complexes available in an aqueous medium, only one dissociates. the time needed by sugammadex to revert rocuronium-induced neuromuscular blockade is much shorter (c.a. 1.5 min) than that for neostigmine. uronium inclusion complex may not be fully eliminated even after seven days. cyclodextrins were regarded as excipients with solubilizing and stabilizing properties. discovery was part of the research for new polysulfated-based drug candidates to treat HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) the high biocompatibility of HPCD makes it the cyclodextrin of choice for medicinal applications that require cholesterol sequestering. it removes cholesterol molecules of the membrane of host cells, rendering them less susceptible to viral infection. it also removes cholesterol of viral particles, and by this mechanism it causes disruption of both HIV and SIV. new cyclodextrin derivatives designed for the treatment of influenza include a family of fullerene-cyclodextrin conjugates. a family of pentacyclic triterpene-functionalized per-(2,3-di-O-methyl)--, -, and -CD derivatives were the most potent, with IC50 values as low as 4.7 M against virus cultivated inside canine epithelial kidney cells. the vaccine uses the nasal delivery route to afford a patient-friendly administration, expected to be better accepted than the currently available injections. the synergic effect of HPCD with immunoglobulins was proven by several previous studies with mice and macaques. a monocyte cell model (U937 myelomonocyte cell line) confirmed a significant reduction in infection rates upon treatment with RAMEB (30 mM) [49] RAMEB alters the protein metabolism of the virus inside the mosquito cells, namely by lowering the expression of NS1 (non-structural protein 1) [51] new cyclodextrins are being developed for the treatment of hepatitis C. a conjugate of fullerene (C60) with two -CD units was designed to combine the antiviral properties of C60 with good aqueous solubility. this molecule presents an IC50 of 0.17 M against HCV and it is described as the first of a new class of HCV entry inhibitor. new cyclodextrin derivatives designed for the treatment of influenza include a family of fullerene-cyclodextrin conjugates and pentacyclic triterpene-functionalized per-(2,3-di-O-methyl)--, and -CD derivatives. the terpenic -CD derivatives were the most potent, with IC50 values as low as 4.7 M against virus. the new CDs are non-toxic against host cells. the antiviral properties of cyclodextrins also served as a base for the development of an innovative influenza vaccine by a research group from a japanese group. the depletion of cholesterol by RAMEB in virus from the Flaviviridae family was shown to affect flaviviral entry into the target cells as well as their ability to replicate inside the cells. this was considered a promising result for the management of infections from this family, which includes dengue virus (DEN) and japan encephalitis virus (JEV) the ability of these CDs to reduce viral infectivity has already been demonstrated against several common viruses. HPCD and RAMEB interfere with the infectivity of viruses responsible for chronic infections, namely the varicela-zooster virus (VZV) that causes chickenpox [59], and the hepatitis C virus [60,61]. an aqueous solution of HPCD caused a 21% reduction of liver infection compared to the control [64]. there is also a patent on the leishmanicidal use of RAMEB, in doses of 20 to 500 mg/kg of body weight. this cyclodextrin is not regulated for oral administration by agencies, such as the EMA and FDA. the most potent compound was the sodium salt of a poly-sulphated -cyclodextrin with 16.9 sulphate groups (per CD molecule) this derivative exhibited an IC50 value of 2.4 0.3 M against P. falciparum. the results show that 16.9-sulphated--CD could be a promising new lead for malaria treatment. a single daily dose of 500 mg/kg of body weight was shown to reduce clinical symptoms and the intensity of infection in the lambs. a single daily dose of -CD at 500 mg/kg of body weight (distributed over four intakes) during six consecutive days was able to prevent diarrhea onset in 83% of the cases (five of six goats) leishmanicidal Cyclodextrins Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease endemic to tropical countries of central and south Americas, Africa, and the Middle East. the disease is threatening to spread to the USA and south Europe due to global warming. anionic saccharides are effective in blocking the parasite from entering target cells, specifically erythrocytes and hepatocytes. results showed that the size of the cyclodextrin ring is not a critical factor for the activity, as derivatives from all the parent cyclodextrins (-, -, and -CDs) inhibited parasite replication. sporidiosis is transmitted by water contaminated with oocysts of C. parvum. each one releases four infectious sporozoites once inside the intestines of the host. two native cyclodextrins are very useful for the control of criptosporidiosis. a daily dose of -CD at 500 mg/kg of body weight (distributed over four intakes) during six consecutive days was able to prevent diarrhea onset in 83% of the cases (five of six goats) a higher dosage and perhaps a longer treatment time would be worth investigating to determine the optimal therapeutic plan. further studies could also include clinical trials on humans. HPCD exhibits anti-inflammatory action by regulating complement-related genes in the cells of the plaque and reducing levels of a pro-inflammatory molecule, complement component C5 [79]. -CD is already approved as a nutritional supplement. degenerative disorder characterized by abnormal accumulation of cholesterol and sphingolipids in the affected cells due to failure in the gene that encodes the transport protein NPC1. it affects brain cells quite strongly, triggering severe neurological symptoms, such as ataxia, tremors, loss of muscle tone, and loss of vision. the lack of medication against NPC encouraged the search for innovative medication to remove lipid deposits in the brains of these patients. in three children aged from 30 to 36 months, HPCD improved scores on the cognitive level, swallowing ability, fine motor skills, and balance/gait [90]. another trial with 14 participants of a wider scale of ages, from 4 to 23 years, confirmed that there is an overall slowing of the progression of the disease upon intrathecal administration of HPCD. the high concentration of acetylcholine drives it to replace the blocking agent at the nicotinic receptors, restoring normal functionality. however, classic reversal drugs have two major setbacks: (i) they are not selective, causing side effects in muscarinic receptors that translate into dryness of the mouth and gastrointestinal dysfunctions. dium 6A,6B,6C,6D,6E,6F,6G,6H- -octakis-S-(2-carboxyethyl)-6A,6B,6C,6D,6E,6F,6G,6H- -octakis-S-(2-carboxyethyl) 6A,6B,6C,6D,6E,6F,6G,6H sugammadexrocuronium inclusion complex may not be fully eliminated even after seven days. semen Cryopreservation Preservation of semen through freezing is a practical and cost-effective process of widespread use in the industry of poultry and cattle. a 30% reduction of membrane cholesterol loss was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. the RAMEBcholesterol complex is also useful in the cryopreservation of the sperm of other mammal species. adding RAMEB to buffalo sperm at doses of 1, 2, 4, and 8 mg/mL brings a dose-dependent increase in sperm capacitation. biomimetic corneal implants corneal blindness affects around 5 million people [113]. the origins are multifactorial, including hyperkeratinisation associated with ophthalmic infections or small eye injuries. the treatment involves replacement of the cornea by transplantation of another human cornea, harvested post-mortem from volunteer organ donors. the presence of cyclodextrins reduces crosslinking between the various trimers that form the fibrils. joint fillers for arthritis The use of CDs in tissue engineering applications, such as joint or bone trauma and arthritis, is currently under development. a 30% reduction of membrane cholesterol loss was confirmed by fluorescence microscopy. the RAMEBcholesterol complex is also useful in the cryopreservation of the sperm of other mammal species. spermatozoa is less viable than the control by c.a. 22% when treated with 1.3 mg/mL (1 mM) RAMEB and by c.a. 40% when treated with 6.5 mg/mL (5 mM) RAMEB. adding cholesterol in tandem with the cyclodextrins seems to be detrimental. biomimetic corneal substitutes can be engineered using native cyclodextrins. cyclodextrins modulate the type I collagen self-assembly process during vitrification. cyclodextrins are postulated to interact with hydrophobic residues of amino acids present in single chains during their formation. in is patented for use in the treatment or prevention of cartilage degeneration and arthrosis or arthritis diseases, or as a filling agent for soft tissues and mucosae. cyclodextrins are steadily making their way into medicinal applications, both as APIs and in biomedical engineering. cyclodextrins also interact with collagen, which makes them promising modulators for medicinal biomaterials. biomimetic corneas prepared by growing collagen in a CD-containing medium as well as filling materials for arthritis-damaged joints made of CDs."}
