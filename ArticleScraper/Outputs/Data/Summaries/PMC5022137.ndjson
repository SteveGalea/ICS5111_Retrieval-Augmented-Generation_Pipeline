{"summary": "PCR detection is based on the identification of DNA/RNA fragments corresponding to a pathogen\u2019s genome. despite these advantages, PCR detection requires undamaged microbial DNA/RNA and is unable to discriminate between alive and dead organisms. in general, PCR detection requires undamaged microbial DNA/RNA. the development of fast, cost-effective, and reliable pathogen detection methods remains a necessity. despite the existence of a large variety of antibacterial and antiviral drugs, the problems of side effects and drug resistance are still unsolved. an aptamer could be created against almost any target (even toxic or non-immunogenic) general SELEX scheme Aptamers are obtained from combinatorial libraries of nucleic acids by selection in vitro. single-stranded DNA libraries are obtained by standard methods of oligonucleotide synthesis. a promoter sequence for T7 RNA polymerase is introduced into the 5\u2032-end region of ssDNA library. the library is cloned and sequenced to determine the sequences of individual aptamers. at present, both DNA and RNA libraries are widely used for aptamer SELEX. aptamers could potentially form much larger variety of secondary structures than DNA aptamers. a wide spectrum of aptamers has been obtained for effective reverse transcriptase binding. several aptamers were able to inhibit the viral replication in cells. the selected antiviral aptamers possess a large variety of secondary structures. the surface glycoprotein gp120 binds to CD4 receptor on the host cell surface. due to conformational changes enables an interaction with the alternative coreceptors, CCR5 or CXCR4. the viral and cellular membranes then fuse and the viral RNA enters the cell. aptamers were used as a delivery vehicle for siRNA targeting tat/rev exon into HIV-1-infected cells as a part of a chimeric molecule. aptamers were different in the structure and binding sites from those described above. they were applied in design of chimeric molecules containing siRNA targeting tat/rev exon of HIV-1. new tab Schematic representation of aptamer-based siRNA delivery system. aptamer beacons based on 93del were designed for visualization of viral proteins in living cells. RNA aptamers targeting the polyprotein gag and the nucleocapsid protein were also successfully acquired. the majority of anti-HIV aptamers were selected against viral proteins. but viral RNA fragments could also be used as selection targets. aptamer was constructed with a goal of inhibition of HIV replication in the cell culture. the cassette showed nucleus penetration and consistent expression, resulting in the complete inhibition of HIV replication. synthetic analogs of the R0624 aptamer were obtained as well. aptamers possessed high affinity to their targets (Kd from 4 to 297 nM) the hairpin-forming aptamers obtained during this process possessed high affinity to their targets (Kd from 4 to 297 nM) a genomic SELEX was conducted, taking in vitro transcripts of human genome as a starting library. aptamer-siRNA chimeras can directly inhibit the viral infection due to binding with CD4 and blocking cell penetration of viral particles. chimeric constructs in hydroxyethylcellulose gel resulted in the effective inhibition of infection together with the longer duration of the effect due to promotion of therapeutic agents at the administration area. DNA aptamers were able to bind to a peptide corresponding with the highly conservative region of HA, common to all influenza A viruses of H3 strain. these aptamers successfully inhibited the invasion into the cells and blocked the viral infection in both tissue cultures and animal models. DNA and RNA aptamers against receptor binding region HA1 of HA were selected. all these aptamers possessed antiviral properties and significantly inhibited the viral infection in cell cultures. the development of methods for the rapid detection and identification of avian influenza virus is essential for blocking the expansion of viral infection. around 80% of infected patients develop hepatic cirrhosis, and in some cases, hepatocarcinoma. the use of interferon itself or in combination with ribavirin is the most widely used therapy; however, it is expensive and has a high probability of adverse effects. mutant viruses resistant to these drugs have already emerged. authors to consider the ZE2 aptamer as a prospective diagnostic and therapeutic agent. other viral proteins can also be used as SELEX targets. authors to consider the ZE2 aptamer as a prospective diagnostic and therapeutic agent. another aptamer targeting the core antigen was applied for the construction of sol\u2013gel-based chips for the core antigen detection in infected patients\u2019 serum. RNA aptamers targeting the P protein of human hepatitis B virus (Feng et al., 2011) and the related duck hepatitis B virus have been obtained. the best group had an 87% survival rate, which was much better than the GE54 aptamer. aptamer FO24 selected against infected cells could have more common cell surface targets compared with the GE54 aptamer G protein target. therapeutic agents were obtained for treatment of human cytomegalovirus (Wang et al., 2000), herpes simplex virus (Gopinath et al., 2012; Moore et al., 2011b), SARS coronavirus (Jang et al., 2008), hemorrhagic septicemia virus (Punnarak et al., 2012), and viral protein 35 of Ebola virus (Binning et al. protein gp120 2\u2032-F-RNA Inhibition of HIV-1 infection by chimeric molecules containing siRNA targeting tat/rev exon of HIV-1 Zhou et al.

James and co-authors selected 2\u2032-F-modified RNA aptamer B40 binding to the BaL viral strain. the aptamer B40 inhibited different types of HIV-1 infection in the culture PBMC. aptamer B40 aptamer at maximum concentration of 2 M had no cytotoxic effect on cardiomyocytes and PBMC. aptamers were different in the structure and binding sites from those described above. they were applied in design of chimeric molecules containing siRNA targeting tat/rev exon of HIV-1. when inside the cell, the siRNA part of the chimera was processed in the RISC complex. aptamer 93del, targeting viral reverse transcriptase and integrase in vitro, is another promising target for the selection of HIV-1 inhibiting aptamers. this 16 nt aptamer forms a dimeric DNA quadruplex in the presence of K+ ions. the inhibiting activity of 93del is stipulated by its interaction with viral particles and by blocking the early stages of intracellular viral replication. protein gag and the nucleocapsid protein were also successfully acquired. the majority of anti-HIV aptamers were selected against viral proteins. however, viral RNA fragments could also be used as selection targets. modified analogs containing 2\u2032-OMe nucleotides and N3\u2032-P5\u2032-phosphoramidate internucleotide linkages possessed high affinity to the TAR fragment. partially modified hexitol-containing aptamer retained high affinity to RNA target. aptamers containing ribo-, deoxyribo-, and LNA-nucleotides possessed high binding affinity. the hairpin-forming aptamers obtained during this process possessed high affinity to their targets (Kd from 4 to 297 nM) aptamers have a stem-loop structure with a 6-nt loop and binding to TAR RNA target is also provided by the formation of kissing complex. aptamers directed to non-viral targets can also be inhibited by aptamers. administration of chimeric constructs in hydroxyethylcellulose gel resulted in the effective inhibition of infection together with the longer duration of the effect. it was supposed that such siRNA\u2013aptamer chimeras could be applied for the design of locally acting drugs. DNA aptamers were able to bind to a peptide corresponding with the highly conservative region of HA, common to all influenza A viruses of H3 strain. these aptamers inhibited the HA invasion into the cells and blocked the viral infection in both tissue cultures and animal models. a novel detection system was developed using a DNA aptamer as a recognizing element. this system allowed the detection of different influenza strains in biological samples. the resulting aptasensor provided a reliable detection of the avian influenza virus in pure cultures. RNA aptamers targeting the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were obtained by Biroccio et al. (2002). the non-structural NS2 protein, which participates in the initiation of viral RNA replication, was used as a target for DNA SELEX. two bifunctional aptamers were obtained separately and then connected by a polynucleotide linker. these two aptamers inhibited protease activity of the NS3 viral protein in HeLa cell culture. in vitro inhibition of the viral genome replication system by these aptamers was also demonstrated. to date, RNA aptamers targeting the P protein of human hepatitis B virus and duck hepatitis B virus have been obtained. the same group of authors also obtained DNA aptamers that are capable of binding virus-infected eukaryotic cells. aptamer FO24 selected against infected cells could have more common cell surface targets compared with the GE54 aptamer G protein target. the same group obtained DNA aptamers against vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells. aptamers targeting SARS coronavirus (Ahn et al., 2009), Rift Valley fever virus (Ellenbecker et al., 2012) and foot-and-mouth disease virus (Bruno et al., 2008a) some of the anti-HIV-1 aptamer-based therapeutics have already been tested on animals.

(2002) DBL1 protein corresponding to the semi-conservative N-terminal domain of PfEMP1 protein of P. falciparum. colorimetric aptasensor LOD is 75\u2013100 parasites/l in blood samples. this aptasensor allowed the detection of a single CFU of target S. enterica in an assay that was close to real-time. the aptasensor was also shown to be specific, as no signal was detected from Escherichia coli or Lactobacillus casei containing samples. several modified 2\u2032-F-RNA aptamers against the outer membrane protein, OmpC, of S. Typhimurium were described in. one aptamer, I-2, possessed high affinity to the target protein (Kd = 20.27 nM) and, in contrast to the other obtained aptamers, was able to bind intact S. typhimurium cells. aptamers selected against S. typhimurium inhibited the growth of the bacteria on Petri dishes. the aptamer with the highest binding affinity (Kd = 25 nM) was applied for the development of an impedimetric biosensor. the obtained aptasensor was able to detect DPBS down to 600 CFU/ml. a DNA aptamer selected against the cells of S. paratyphi A was used as the basis for an optical detection system. a chimeric molecule made of DNA aptamer and peroxidase DNAzyme is non-covalently conjugated to the single-walled carbon nanotubes. five different 88 nt DNA aptamers were obtained by Cao et al. (2009) using whole cell SELEX procedure with counter-selection against Streptococcus (A5005) or S. epidermidis to reduce the amount of non-specific sequences. each of the selected 88 nt DNA aptamers demonstrated high affinity and selectivity of binding of S. aureus. aptamers selected against bacterial toxins are of a particular interest. aptamers -27, -33, -36, and -49 significantly inhibited -toxin-mediated cell death in Jurkat T cells. Escherichia coli is one of the most common and normally harmless bacteria found in the intestinal tract of warm blooded animals. however, some virulent strains of E. coli are dangerous food-borne pathogens. both whole bacteria and bacterial components could be used as SELEX targets. the pathogen detection limit was 1.1 103 CFU/ml in pure culture and 2.1 103 CFU/ml in biological samples. the 2\u2032-F-RNA aptamer I-1 against E. coli strain was obtained using whole bacterial cells as a target. further experiments for using the aptamer for direct pathogen detection on different samples are planned. the development of potentiometric biosensor based on aptamer covalently immobilized on single-walled carbon nanotubes was also described. the development of conceptually new therapeutic agents would enable improvements in this field. the highest target binding affinity (Kd = 870 nM) was demonstrated for the aptamer G9 and its shortened versions. the aptamer inhibited the activity of the enzyme to 50% at concentration of 39.3 nM. RNA aptamers were selected against the bacterial protein EsxG. they possessed high target binding affinity (Kd = 8.04 nM and 78.85 nM), therefore, the authors suggested that they could be used as prospective molecular probes in the functional studies of EsxG as potential tuberculosis marker. all these aptamers can potentially be used as a prospective therapeutic agent and diagnostic tools. salmonella salmonella enterica is a dangerous pathogen that can be transmitted through contaminated food and water. aptamer S-PS8.4 specifically binds type IVB pili of S. enterica serovar Typhi. aptamers were able to bind the outer membrane proteins isolated from seven (7) other serovars as well as the whole bacteria. the aptasensor was also shown to be specific, as no signal was detected from Escherichia coli containing samples. modified 2\u2032-F-RNA aptamers against the outer membrane protein, OmpC, of S. Typhimurium were described in (Han & Lee, 2013) one aptamer, I-2, possessed high affinity to the target protein (Kd = 20.27 nM) and, in contrast to the other obtained aptamers, was able to bind intact S. typhimurium cells. aptamers selected against S. typhimurium inhibited the growth of the bacteria on Petri dishes. the aptamer with the highest binding affinity (Kd = 25 nM) was applied for the development of an impedimetric biosensor. a chimeric molecule made of DNA aptamer and peroxidase DNAzyme is non-covalently conjugated to the single-walled carbon nanotubes. the aptamer binds to the target and dissociates from the surface of the nanotubes. at the final stage, after the addition of the luminol, the latter reacts with hydrogen peroxide generating a chemiluminescent signal. five different 88 nt DNA aptamers were obtained by Cao et al. (2009) using whole cell SELEX procedure with counter-selection against Streptococcus (A5005) or S. epidermidis to reduce the amount of non-specific sequences. each of the selected 88 nt DNA aptamers demonstrated high affinity and selectivity of binding of S. aureus. aptamers conjugated with up-conversion nanoparticles were applied for a specific detection of S. aureus and S. typhimurium. aptamers -27, -33, -36, and -49 significantly inhibited -toxin-mediated cell death in Jurkat T cells. virulent strains of E. coli can cause diseases such as hemorrhagic and non-hemorrhagic diarrhea, occasional kidney failure or hemolytic uremic syndrome. in order to obtain new aptamers against E. coli, both whole bacteria and bacterial components could be used as SELEX targets. a DNA aptamer against lipopolysaccharide of E. coli O111:B4 was selected. the pathogen detection limit was 1.1 103 CFU/ml in pure culture and 2.1 103 CFU/ml in biological samples. the 2\u2032-F-RNA aptamer I-1 against E. coli strain was obtained using whole bacterial cells as a target. further experiments for using the aptamer for direct pathogen detection on different samples are planned. mycobacterium tuberculosis still remains a widespread dangerous infection. the development of conceptually new therapeutic agents would enable improvements in this field. aptamer 64 selected in this work was immobilized on the surface of a polystyrol microplate. another aptamer, M64RA, was used as a reporter component. the system was tested on 77 samples of culture filtrates including M. tuberculosis and other species. the obtained aptamers G47 and G48 possessed high target binding affinity (Kd = 8.04 nM and 78.85 nM), therefore, the authors suggested that they could be used as prospective molecular probes in the functional studies of EsxG as potential tuberculosis marker. unicellular parasites Various diseases caused by unicellular parasites remain a major concern worldwide. malaria causes the death of approximately 2.7 million people per year. most known drugs for the parasites\u2019 infection treatment are not very effective and have some serious side effects. aptamer 2\u201316 pyrimidine nucleotides were replaced by 2\u2032-amino or 2\u2032-fluoro analogs. 2\u2032-aminomodification resulted in the complete loss of binding affinity. 2\u2032-fluoro-modified aptamers retained the ability to bind trypanosomes. the aptamer cl57 (Lorger et al., 2003) was covalently immobilized onto the surface of single-walled carbon nanotubes. modified 2\u2032-fluoro RNA aptamers were also obtained against trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Shagas disease. the obtained aptamer at the concentration of 387 nM (12 g/ml) caused almost complete destruction of rosettes, thus making it a potential anti-malaria drug. aptamers could be applied for direct detection of the pathogen in blood samples. aptamers selected against viral surface proteins can be applied for the inhibition of virus\u2013cell fusion as well as for the design of diagnostic systems. aptamers were also obtained to bind HIV-1 TAR RNA, which is responsible for viral transcription. the development of aptamer-based diagnostic tools resulted in the whole array of specific and sensitive biosensors for pathogen detection. there is also a number of encouraging examples of aptamers that can inhibit the infections."}
