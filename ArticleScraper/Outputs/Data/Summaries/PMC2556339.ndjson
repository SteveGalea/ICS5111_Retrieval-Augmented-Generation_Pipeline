{"summary": "a module of questions was developed and field tested on 192 adults using the new south Wales Department of Health's in-house computer Assisted telephone interviewing facility. the questions were then modified and re field tested on 202 adults. the reliability of the questions was acceptable with kappa ranging between 0.25 and 0.51. a key component of a population's response is the perception of risk or threat. a key component of a population's response is the perception of risk or threat. 33% of respondents felt the chance of an outbreak was high or very high. 45% of respondents thought they were likely or very likely to become infected. this figure varied from 32% (Denmark and Singapore) to 61% (Poland and Spain) subject matter experts and survey methodologists developed a set of 6 questions for field-testing. each proposed question was considered for clarity, ease of administration, and possible biases. a set of questions was developed for field-testing. kappa = 0.28 (0.18\u20130.38) Indicator kappa = 0.25 (0.12\u20130.38) Agreement = 39.1% Don't know = 0% Refused = 0% Q.3 Do you feel you have changed the way you live your life because of the possibility of an influenza pandemic in Australia? an emergency situation such as an influenza pandemic, government authorities might request cooperation from the public in a number of ways Please indicate how willing would you be to receive vaccination. weighted kappa = 0.45 (0.35\u20130.56) Indicator kappa = 0.51 (0.34\u20130.67) Agreement = 57.1% Don't know = 0% Refused = 0% Q.5 Isolate yourself from others if needed.
