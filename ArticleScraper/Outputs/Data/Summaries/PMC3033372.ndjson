{"summary": "bovine leukemia Virus (BLV) and human T-Cell Leukemia Virus Type-1 (HTLV-1) are related deltaretroviruses that cause aggressive lymphoproliferative disorders in a small percentage of infected hosts. retroviruses must catalyse fusion of the viral and target cell membranes to promote entry of the viral capsid into the target cell. the leash and -helical region (LHR) are structurally distinct from the prototypic extensively -helical peptide inhibitors of human immunodeficiency virus but are reminiscent of the leash regions observed in influenza haemagglutinin [20], [21], [22], [23]. this information is critical to the development of therapeutically relevant peptide or low-molecular-weight inhibitors of HTLV-1 entry. the structure of the BLV TM ectodomain was fused to the C-terminal end of maltose binding protein via a three-alanine spacer. the soluble purified protein was crystallised and the structure solved to a resolution of 2.0. preliminary lower resolution structures obtained for crystals formed in the absence of TCEP-HCL reveal an intact disulphide. these data indicate that the disulphide is not essential for constraining the chain reversal region in the folded protein. the known defects in membrane fusion associated with substitution of these cysteines are likely due to direct perturbation of the inter-subunit disulphide isomerisation step of the envelope-mediated membrane fusion process. a panel of mutants in BLV envelope are processed and expressed identically in vivo. mutants were designed to perturb key features of the trimer-of-hairpins structure. no significant differences in expression level of gp51 or cleavage of precursor protein, gp72, were observed. pRSV-Rev into syncytium formation assays with non-transfected HeLa cells as target cells. one sample was lysed for Western analysis, another stained and examined by flow cytometry. third used as effector cells in syncytium formation assays with non-transfected cells as target cells. Thr353 makes contact through one water molecule with the main-chain of Glu397 and through a separate water molecule to the side-chain of His354. in the context of envelope the T353V substitution completely abrogates envelope-mediated membrane fusion. conserved asn367 (BLV co-ordinates), Arg368 and Asp372 are shown as sticks. the green sphere represents the chloride ion. the green sphere represents the chloride ion. fusion protein ectodomains of HTLV-1 [20], MoMLV [29], Ebola [24], [30], and Syncytin-1 [31] show that the ability to coordinate chloride is retained. introducing a leucine residue at position 367 of BLV TM renders envelope entirely non-fusogenic. the introduction of the N367D mutation into pMBP-BLVhairpin produces a recombinant protein with a major peak at an elution volume consistent with the molecular weight of a tetramer rather than a trimer. the results demonstrate the importance of the chloride-interacting asparagines to the stability of the trimeric coiled coil. substitution of leu404 with alanine results in 80% loss of fusogenic activity relative to wild type. the first -helix of the BLV LHR ends at Asp406, and between the end of this helix and the beginning of the next is a three-residue linker. a conserved leucine, Leu410, docks into the start of a deep hydrophobic pocket. within the second helix is Val414, which is also conserved in HTLV-1. substitution of either Leu410 or Val414 with alanine markedly impairs the fusogenic function of envelope. 85% less effective at catalysing membrane fusion than wild-type envelope. Arg403 of the LHR projects out from one side of the -helix. arginine residue Arg345 is repelled electrostatically by N-helix residue Arg345. even without heat treatment over 50% of the R413A protein was aggregated. contrasting effects of arginine substitutions on envelope fusogenicity are directly due to changes in stability of the post-fusion trimer-of-hairpins structure. heLa cells transfected with either wild-type or R403A mutant were used as effector cells in syncytium formation assays. PBLV-391 inhibited fusion catalysed by wild-type envelope with an IC50 of 3.170.09 M. PBLV-391 only inhibited fusion catalysed by wild-type envelope with an IC50 of 3.170.09 M. PBLV-R403A inhibited envelope catalysed membrane fusion with an IC50 of 1.30.1 M, but inhibited the R403A envelope with an IC50 of >6 M. in both experiments, C34 (a peptide mimetic of HIV-1 gp41 residues Gly627 to Leu661) was used as a negative control. improving thermal stability of the trimer-of-hairpins form of a class-1 fusion alanine substitutions of Arg416 and Arg422 resulted in envelopes that are 91% and 97% less fusogenic than wild-type envelope respectively. however, Arg422 could not be functionally replaced with lysine, the R422K mutation resulted in an 88% reduction in fusogenic activity. pCDNA3.1 transfected with pRSV-Rev was used as a negative control. open green histograms show the fluorescence profile of cells transfected with the indicated envelope construct. all cells were probed for surface displayed envelope. the fusogenic index was calculated as described. the TM ectodomain, including the predicted coiled coil and LHR from Ala326 to Trp418, was fused to the C-terminal end of maltose binding protein via a three-alanine spacer. the soluble purified protein was crystallised and the structure solved to a resolution of 2.0. the overall fold of the BLV TM ectodomain is that of a trimer-of-hairpins, with the N-termin the envelope-mediated membrane fusion process begins with an extended non-helical leash followed by an eight-residue -helix. this helix is followed by a three-residue linker incorporating a single proline, allowing a sharp kink in the LHR prior to the start of a second -helix. envelope were designed to perturb key features of the trimer-of-hairpins structure. we compared each mutant with the parental \u201cwild-type\u201d envelope. no significant differences in expression level of gp51 or cleavage of precursor protein, gp72, were observed. fisogenic index represents number of nuclei in low-power light microscope field present in syncytia as a percentage of the total nuclei in the field. in the BLV trimer-of-hairpins there are two positions along this interface that harbour polar residues. Thr353 is located approximately half way up the N-helix. threonine with a non-polar residue of equivalent size completely abrogates envelope-mediated membrane fusion. the introduction of the T353V substitution into the pMBP-BLVhairpin vector yields a recombinant protein that completely fails to trimerise. alpha helices are shown as cartoons, conserved asn367 (BLV co-ordinates), Arg368 and Asp372 are shown as sticks. the green sphere represents the chloride ion, with MBP fused to the wild type or mutant BLV TM ectodomain. introducing a leucine residue at position 367 of BLV TM renders envelope entirely non-fusogenic. the substitution does not completely prevent trimerisation of the BLV coiled coil in vitro. but it significantly destabilises the trimer and a large broad peak corresponding to higher order oligomers. the interaction of the LHR with the coiled coil demonstrates the importance of the chloride-interacting asparagines to the stability of the trimeric coiled coil. a detailed view of the BLV LHR bound to the coiled coil and a sequence comparison of the HTLV-1 and BLV LHRs are shown in Fig. 1C and D. the first conserved -helical segment of the LHR ends at Asp406, and between the end of this helix and the beginning of the next is a three-residue linker. the conserved proline (BLV Pro409) of the extended non-helical linker induces a sharp kink in the LHR thereby allowing a second -helix to bind almost directly across the groove, at right angles to the rest of the LHR. substitution of either leu410 or Val414 with alanine markedly impairs the fusogenic function of envelope. arginine (Arg413) participates in electrostatic interactions with the coiled coil. arginine (Arg413) is critical to the inhibitory activity of the HTLV-1 LHR mimetic peptide Pcr-400. the substitutions R403A and R413A have very different effects on the fusogenicity of the BLV envelope, increasing activity by over two-fold and almost completely abolishing activity respectively. the difference to wild-type hairpin was significant (P0.005, t-test) by contrast, the R413A substitution resulted in aggregation of over 70% of total protein. alanine substitutions were introduced into the MBP-BLV Hairpin vector. the trimer-of-hairpins was then re-run over the column with or without heat treatment for 5 mins at 50\u00b0C. PBLV-391 antagonist of envelope fusion [17] inhibited fusion catalysed by wild-type envelope with an IC50 of 3.170.09 M. however, PBLV-391 only inhibited fusion catalysed by wild-type envelope with an IC50 estimated to be >9 M. conserved arginine (Arg413) of the HTLV-1 LHR-mimetic peptide is critical to inhibitory activity. arginine residues equivalent to leu413, Arg416 and leu419 are also of importance to the biological activity of the peptide [21], [22]. d in envelopes that are 91% and 97% less fusogenic than wild type. lysine substitution of Arg416 produced an envelope that was not significantly less fusogenic than wild type. HTLV-1 R422 adopts a near-identical conformation to BLV R413 at the C-terminal segment of the LHR. four key residues interact with the HTLV-1 coiled coil. the contact made by Arg422 is critical to the binding and functional activity of HTLV-1 peptide inhibitors. the model suggests that R422 could bind to a negatively charged ridge. the interaction of Thr353 with an array of water molecules appears to play a critical role in assembly of the coiled coil. substitution of T353 eliminates both in vitro trimerisation and in vivo fusogenicity. threonine residue is replaced by an asparagine which directly hydrogen bonds with the adjacent N-helix. u resultant from receptor binding, mediates electrostatic interactions with a chloride ion, thus driving the trimerisation of the coiled coil to yield the pre-hairpin intermediate in an event pivotal to successful fusion. results suggest that trimerisation of the N-terminus of TM is not a requirement for Env maturation and surface display of trimeric pre-fusogenic envelope. sub-optimal LHR/coiled-coil interactions have been maintained. HTLV-1 and BLV TM structures are conserved in HTLV-1. a second helical motif within the LHR of the trimer-of-hairpins is the first tryptophan. a lysine substitution of Arg413 retains only 10% of the fusogenic activity of wild-type envelope lending further support to this view. a conserved basic residue in the second helical segment of the LHR interacts with the charged rim of a deep pocket lined by non-polar residues. the importance of the pocket and surrounding charge to the assembly of the trimer-of-hairpins and the potency of C-helix-based mimetic peptides has been demonstrated for HIV [43], [44]. we suggest that such charged regions are critical to retroviral envelope-mediated membrane fusion in general. a modified fragment of the plasmid pMAL-gp30hairpin (MBP-BLV-hairpin) was PCR amplified. the fragments were ligated into a pMAL-c2 backbone digested with BglII and PstI. the cell suspension was thawed and the cells lysed by sonication. cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 9,000g for 30 min. the crude lysate was diluted 15 in column buffer and loaded onto an amylose column pre-equilibrated with column buffer. the structure was solved by molecular replacement using a truncated model of MBP-HTLV Hairpin (PDB ID 1MG1) Refinement proceeded through cycles of model building using Coot and O [50], [51] and refinement using REFMAC5 [52]. atomic coordinates and structure factors (code 2XZ3) have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank, Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics, Rutgers University, New Brunswick the peptides were purified by reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography. all peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) the concentration of peptide stock solutions was confirmed by absorbance at 280 nm in 6M guanidine hydrochloride. supernatant from murine hybridoma cell lines expressing monoclonal antibodies raised against recombinant antigen derived from BLV or HTLV-1 envelope. anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugated secondary antibody at a dilution of 110,000 in PBS containing 5% (w/v) marvel and 0.025% Triton X-100. 5.0105 cells were incubated with agitation for 1 hr at plasmids pCMV-BLVenv-RRE and pRSV-Rev have been described. the area of the peak corresponding to the aggregate was expressed as a percentage of the total area under both this peak and the peak corresponding to the trimer. cells were grown at 37\u00b0C with vigorous shaking in LB. protein expression was induced with Isopropylthio--D-galactoside (IPTG) at a final concentration of 0.5 mM for 4 h at 37\u00b0C. optimum crystallization was achieved by streak seeding with a reservoir solution composed of 24.5% (v/v) isopropanol, 13.5% (v/v) PEG-4000 and 0.1 M sodium citrate pH 5.6. diffraction data was collected at beamline BM14 at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) in Grenoble. peptides were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), the concentration of peptide stock solutions was confirmed by absorbance at 280 nm in 6M guanidine hydrochloride. peptides were used at the final concentrations indicated. -buffered saline pH 7.4 (PBS), fixed using 3% paraformaldehyde in PBS. the fraction of nuclei contained within syncytia in a 20x light microscope field was expressed as a percentage of the total number of nuclei within the field. oligomerisation states of MBP-BLV-hairpin and mutant derivatives were examined by gel filtration using a superdex 200 column equilibrated with MBP elution buffer. samples from these fractions were re-run over the column either without heat treatment or with heat treatment at the temperature specified for 5 min."}
