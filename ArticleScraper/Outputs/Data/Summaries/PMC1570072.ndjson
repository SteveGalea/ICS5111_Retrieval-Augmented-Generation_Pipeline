(1999) examined the range of health outcomes associated with the potential health impacts of blizzards. their conclusions confirm the finding that blizzards elevate the incidence of myocardial infarction (i.e., heart attacks) the authors concluded that it was uncertain how future pollutant concentrations would respond to climate change. the net effect on human health was uncertain because uncertainty exists with respect to magnitude or nature of change in one or more of these components. additional studies explored the impacts of climate change on urban heat islands and their effects on ambient concentrations of ozone. Taha (2001) projected increases in peak ozone concentrations in los Angeles and Sacramento, California. a critical data gap was the need to improve regional models of climate variability and change at a spatial scale that could be incorporated into regional/national health impact models. recent studies examining the potential impacts of climate variability and change on the risks and incidence of water- and food-borne illnesses strongly support the conclusions of Rose et al. (2001) mosquito-borne illnesses could result in population explosions and crashes that could increase disease risk. increasing average temperatures would generally reduce the population\u2019s susceptibility to epidemics, assuming increased amounts of time would be spent indoors in air-conditioned environments. the authors assumed that an increase in global average temperatures would increase the severity and frequency of heat events. this would result in a net increase in temperature-related morbidity and mortality because any ameliorating impact of increasing temperature on winter mortality rates would not be great enough to offset the projected increase in mortality attributed to heat events. a number of studies support prior conclusions regarding the existence of regional differences in the vulnerability of U.S. populations, with populations in northeastern and north-central regions at the highest risk. a number of studies support prior conclusions regarding the existence of regional differences in the vulnerability of U.S. populations. these studies can be seen as an argument that there is an adaptive trend in the united states that will minimize the future health impacts of extreme heat events. sheridan and dolney (2003) reported results contradicting the HSA\u2019s conclusion that residing in urban areas elevated one\u2019s health risks during heat events, partly because of the urban heat island effect. health effects related to extreme weather events Greenough et al. (2001) reviewed literature on potential health impacts of changes in frequency and intensity of extreme weather as a result of climate change. authors concluded that increases in frequency and severity of extreme precipitation would directly affect flooding. there was less certainty about the health impacts of changes in other extreme weather events that would be attributable to climate change. a large number of publications evaluated in the second screening step focused on the short- and long-term mental health effects of extreme precipitation events. more research has confirmed that extreme events can increase PTSD (e.g., Hajat et al. 2003) no publications that credibly challenge long-standing conclusions that increases in the concentration of airborne pollutants would increase morbidity and premature mortality. this general conclusion is consistent with the increase in the range of non-fatal outcomes that have been associated with changes in air pollutant concentrations. the divergent results reflect the strong influence in these models of assumptions about a number of factors affecting ozone formation and resulting ambient concentrations. the divergent results reflect the strong influence in these models of assumptions about a number of factors affecting ozone formation and resulting ambient concentrations. extreme precipitation events increase the loading of contaminants to waterways, and Casman et al. concluded that climate change could increase the risk of illness associated with Cryptosporidium parvum. authors noted that following current food preparation and storage recommendations could offset any climate change-induced increase in risk. the research needs identified in the HSA focused primarily on developing a better understanding of the populations of mosquitoes, ticks, and rodents. a lack of understanding of how recent and historical climate variability has affected the incidence of vector-borne diseases. only a limited number of recent studies address the potential response of vector- and rodent-borne illnesses to climate change in the united states. a new literature does not identify a change in the range of climate-sensitive health outcomes should not be surprising. the selected health outcomes have long been the focus of epidemiologic research in the united states, with associations between changes in weather factors and increased morbidity and mortality relatively well described. climate change will likely increase morbidity and mortality risks. however, the capacity of the united states to implement effective and efficient adaptation measures is assumed to remain high throughout this century."}
