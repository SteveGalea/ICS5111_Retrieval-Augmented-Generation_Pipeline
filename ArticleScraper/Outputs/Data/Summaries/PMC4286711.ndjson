{"summary": "hCV capsid (core) protein (HCVcp) is a highly demanded antigen for various diagnostic, immunization and pathogenesis studies. plants are considered as an expression system for producing safe and inexpensive biopharmaceutical proteins. no data for rapid, simple and lower-priced protein expression is available for HCVcp. the expression level of HCVcp was enhanced by 4-5 times in P19 co-agroinfiltrated plants with better outcomes for PVX. the plant-derived HCVcp (pHCVcp) could properly identify the HCVcp antibody in HCV-infected human sera compared to Escherichia coli-derived HCVcp. anticore antibodies are the first to be raised after the onset of infection, a property that has provided an important diagnostic value for this protein. anticore antibodies are the first to be raised after the onset of infection, a property that has located it among antibody-capturing antigens in commercially available serological assays. both studies addressed only the transgenic (stable) tobacco plant generation for HCVcp. but transient expression in plants, compared with transgenic plant generation, is currently the method of choice due to several advantages like simplicity and feasibility of rapid protein expression. an important example of transient expression in plants is the production of seasonal influenza vaccines in tobacco (26). coding HCVcp N-121 was used as the source of the sequence for construction of plant-based expression vectors. the plant-optimized HCVcp gene for recombinant expression in tobacco was synthesized and delivered as a clone in pUC57 plasmid by ShineGene Molecular Biotech Inc. the synthetic gene was subcloned into BamHI and SacI sites of the pBI121 vector (38) under the control of caMV 35S promoter and upstream of the nopaline synthase transcriptional terminator (NOS-Ter) in this study, the PVX-GW vector (32) was used as the PVX-based viral vector. the synthetic Tr-HCVcp gene was inserted into pBI121 through BamHI/SacI sites under the control of caMV 35S promoter. cloned into ClaI/SalI sites of PVX-GW vector under the control of duplicated PVX-coat protein subgenomic promoter. the transformed colonies were confirmed by gene-specific colony PCR. all the chemicals, culture media and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma (US) and Merck (Germany) companies. all the chemicals, culture media and antibiotics were purchased from Sigma (US) and Merck (Germany) companies. infiltrated tobacco leaves were ground into a fine powder in liquid nitrogen. 0.5-mL extraction buffer was added to each gram of powdered leaf tissue. total soluble protein (TSP) was removed from cell debris by centrifugation. the membrane was incubated with 1:8000 diluted horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibodies (Sigma, USA) for one hour. 3-3\u2019diaminobenzidine (DAB, Sigma, USA) was used for color development. the protein bands were either stained with coomassie brilliant blue (Bio-Rad) or transferred to the PVDF membrane. biotinylated anti-core polyclonal antibodies (1:1000 dilution, Abcam, UK) were immersed into the wells. incubation continued at 37\u00b0C for one hour followed by washing steps and another similar incubation with streptavidin HRP conjugate (1:4000; Sigma) codon-usage of HCVcp nucleotide sequences were considered. codon optimization according to the codon adaptation index of nuclear-encoded genes of tobacco (35), removal of (plant) mRNA destabilizing sequences from the native HCVcp coding sequence, Addition of Kozak (36) and hexahistidine (6xHis)-tag for nickel affinity purification. synthetic gene was cloned into PVX-GW vector. PCR amplified using forward primer, F-Kozak-VX: 5 -TAATATCGAGCCACCATGGCTCATCACC-3 and a reverse primer, R-core-VX: 5 -TAATGTCGACGGATCATCACC-3. the 439-bp amplicon was digested by ClaI and SalI enzymes. transformation of Agrobacterium tumefactions by Plant Expression Vectors A. tumefactions strain LB4404 was transformed with PVX-core and pBI-core vectors. transformed colonies were confirmed by gene-specific colony PCR using rifampicin (RIF) and 50 g/mL kanamycin (KAN) p19 silencing-suppressor gene was previously cloned into pCAMBIA 1304 vector (CAMBIA Co., Australia) the constructed expression vectors were co-infiltrated with Agrobacterium strain LB4404, harboring the p19 silencing-suppressor gene (42) from tomato bushy stunt virus. the total soluble protein (TSP) was removed from cell debris by centrifugation of leaf extracts for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C (14000 rpm) the E. coli-derived HCVcp (eHCVcp) and plant-derived HCVcp (pHCVcp) were purified through application of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (ni-NTA) chromatography. AGE and western blotting analyses, purified HCV core from E. coli and plant and plant crude extracts of the recombinant HCV core protein expressed by pBI121 and PVX vectors were loaded onto a 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel. by the end of electrophoresis, the protein bands were either stained with coomassie brilliant blue (Bio-Rad) or transferred to the PVDF membrane. an indirect ELISA for detection of anti-core antibodies in human sera was developed. the pooled human sera (1/20 dilution) was coated in ELISA plates. the pooled human sera (1/20 dilution) from five HCV seropositive patients and one serum negative were incubated with the plate for two hours at room temperature. Kozak (GCCACCATGGC) sequence (36) harbored the start codon (ATG) at 5\u2019, KDEL nucleotides at 3\u2032 end, the designed restriction sites and all nucleotide modifications, was properly located in the Tr-HCVcp sequence (Figure 1). the corresponding nucleotide alterations increased the CAI value from 0.65 to 0.85. dot blot analysis showed that HCV core was present in extracts of the tobacco leaves, transformed by each of the vectors (pBI-core and PVX-core), compared to negative controls with the same amount of loaded TSP. the result tentatively implied a higher level of expression for PVX-core compared with that of pBI-core construct. lane 1: 5 g concentrated plant-purified eHCVcp. Lane 3: crude protein extract from agroinfiltrated leaves with PVX-core (20 g) lane 1: positive control (700 ng purified eHCVcp) nonspecifically-bound plant proteins were eluted from Ni-NTA affinity chromatography besides a band with an electrophoretic mobility of 15 kDa. the recent band was visible on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 4 B) and was also detected using anticore polyclonal antibodies in a western blot assay. the expression levels of pHCVcp by each of the vectors were compared by ELISA. pBI-core and PVX-core were around 0.004% of TSP in the absence of P19 co-agroinfiltration. in its presence, the expression level of pBI-core and PVX-core increased to 0.019% (210 ng/g) and 0.022% (240 ng/g) of TSP fresh leaf weight. expression level of pBI-core and PVX-core were assessed by ELISA. negative control corresponds to HCV negative human sera. eHCVcp denotes plant- and E. coli-derived HCVcp. the corresponding nucleotide alterations increased the codon adaptation index (CAI) value from 0.65 to 0.85 and reduced the GC content from 62.62 to 51.05. 4.2. results of DNA sequencing indicated that the Kozak (GCCACCATGGC) sequence (36), harboring the start codon (ATG) at 5\u2019, KDEL nucleotides at 3\u2032 end, the designed restriction sites and all nucleotide modifications, was properly located in the Tr transformed Agrobacteria were screened for recombinant constructs using core-specific primers (F-Kozak-VX and R-core-VX) the transformed Agrobacteria were screened for recombinant constructs using core-specific primers (F-Kozak-VX and R-core-VX) the colony PCR assay indicated the expected 439-bp fragments. rows 2 and 1 correspond to 5 g and 25 g of TSP, respectively. Coomassie-stained 12% SDS-PAGE gel. Lane 2: 5 g concentrated plant-purified eHCVcp. the concentration of pHCVcp was 1/20 of the column-purified protein. however, none of these endogenous nonspecific plant proteins reacted with anti-HCVcp in western blotting of the protein fraction. sandwich ELISA is the assay of choice and is usual in quantification of antigen proteins. we used a specific monoclonal antibody against the core antigen and polyclonal anticore antibodies (at the bottom of the pHCVcp) in a sandwich ELISA-based protocol. we also prepared a precise standard curve by applying serial dilution (0.1-1 g/mL; data not shown) of purified eHCVcp to calculate the expression levels of pHCV expression level of pBI-core and PVX-core increased to 0.019% (210 ng/g) and 0.022% (240 ng/g) of TSP fresh leaf weight, respectively, was almost five times improvement for pHCVcp expression. leaf control denotes the tobacco leaves transformed by PVX vector alone (ie, without Tr-HCVcp) the first strategy that should be considered would be the optimization of the gene sequence for efficient codon usage by the plant (27). the plant codon-optimized BPV-1 LI gene product increased significantly in comparison to the unmodified counterpart (28) the possible deleterious splicing motif in plants \"GGTAAG\" was removed from the native HCVcp-coding sequence (nucleotides 358-363) our results indicated that the PVX-based vector provided higher expression levels of pHCVcp compared to that of pBI121 vector (53) BI121 in N. tabacum was 0.002% of TSP (56) to that of our study. the enhanced expression levels in our study should be a direct result of the codon optimization and gene silencing suppression strategies undertaken for Tr-HCVcp. the transient expression of pHCVcp in tobacco leaves could provide the proper protein for diagnostic purposes. the study was the first to address construction of a transient tobacco expression system for HCVcp. for highest possible expression efficiency, the HCVcp DNA sequence was codon optimized (based on the CAI for nuclear-encoded genes of tobacco), destabilizing the GGTAAG sequence in the native HCVcp coding sequence was altered. antigen/antibody in ELISA with precise statistical analyses and evaluation of the pHCVcp for immunization studies."}
