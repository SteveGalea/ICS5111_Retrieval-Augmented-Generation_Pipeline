{"summary": "in most patients, HEV infection induces an acute self-limiting hepatitis. but in specific vulnerable groups, the outcome of HEV infection can be much more severe. in pregnant women, HEV infection has a 20% mortality rate. a case report of chronic infection of a human by HEV7 has appeared, indicating that zoonotic transmission of this HEV genotype can occur (18). there are two surviving old-world camel species: Camelus dromedarius (dromedary or one-humped camel), which inhabit the Middle East and North and Northeast Africa. fresh fecal samples and milk samples were collected from camels from four provinces/regions in china. all samples were screened for HEV RNA by heminested reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) four of the 295 fecal samples (1.4%) were positive for HEV RNA. the 255 nt from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region in ORF1 (A) and 201 nt from the ORF2 (B), from this study. the phylogenetic tree was constructed using the general time-reversible model with gamma distribution. two cynomolgus monkeys were successfully infected with the filtered fecal sample containing BcHEV-GP. viremia, urinary and fecal shedding of virus, elevation of liver enzymes, and seroconversion to anti-HEV IgM and IgG were all detected. both monkeys were seronegative for anti-HEV and became seropositive for antibodies against HEV at 4 to 5 wpi. fecal shedding was first detected in fecal samples from the two monkeys at 1 wpi. 2 tested positive for anti-HEV IgM at 5 to 10 wpi, but M1 tested negative. anti-HEV IgG began to rise a week later for M2. detection of anti-HEV IgG started at 4 wpi and remained markedly elevated. hydropic degeneration and slight inflammatory cell infiltrates were found in liver biopsy specimens at 3 wpi for both monkeys. liver tissues were collected at 25 wpi from M1, showing focal necrosis around the central vein and lobular inflammatory cell infiltrates. ground-glass hepatocytes were also scattered in the liver. liver biopsy specimen of M1 collected preinoculation served as negative control. multiple tissues, including liver, kidney, brain, stomach, and intestine, were collected from M1 at 25 wpi. RNA was extracted from supernatants of tissue homogenates. the consensus sequences of M1 and M2 were obtained using fecal samples collected at 3 wpi. the genomes shared an almost identical sequence (99.96% to 99.99% nucleotide identities) to that of BcHEV-GP. a total of 295 fecal samples and 20 milk samples were obtained. all samples were screened for HEV RNA by heminested reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) four of the 295 fecal samples (1.4%) were positive for HEV RNA, all were from farmed camels. t from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase region in ORF1 (A) and 201 nt from the ORF2 (B), from this study. reference sequences are of orthohepevirus A genotypes 1 to 8. cynomolgus monkeys were successfully infected with the filtered fecal sample containing BcHEV-GP. viremia, urinary and fecal shedding of virus, elevation of liver enzymes, and seroconversion to anti-HEV IgM and IgG were all detected. both monkeys were seronegative for anti-HEV and became seropositive for antibodies against HEV at 4 to 5 wpi. fecal shedding was first detected in fecal samples from the two monkeys at 1 wpi. anti-HEV IgG began to rise a week later for M2 and remained positive thereafter. in the case of M1, detection started at 4 wpi and remained markedly elevated during the remaining 25 weeks until the animal\u2019s unexpected death. an acute-type HEV infection was observed in M2, and the infection spontaneously resolved within 9 weeks. hydropic degeneration and slight inflammatory cell infiltrates were found in liver biopsy specimens at 3 wpi for both monkeys. liver tissues were collected at 25 wpi from M1, showing focal necrosis around the central vein and lobular inflammatory cell infiltrates. ground-glass hepatocytes were also scattered in the liver. liver biopsy specimen of M1 collected preinoculation served as negative control. multiple tissues, including liver, kidney, brain, stomach, and intestine, were collected from M1 at 25 wpi. RNA was then extracted from supernatants of tissue homogenates. the consensus sequences of M1 and M2 were obtained using fecal samples collected at 3 wpi. the genomes of M1 and M2 shared an almost identical sequence to that of BcHEV-GP. dromedary camels and dromedary camels are the sole natural hosts of HEV7 and HEV8 respectively. the successful infection of two cynomolgus monkeys with HEV8 inocula suggests a strong zoonotic potential of HEV8. swine HEV (HEV3 and HEV4) (24), rabbit HEV (HEV3) (25, 26), and dromedary HEV (HEV7) (27, 28) successfully establishing infection in nonhuman primates were confirmed later to be able to infect humans. many experimental studies have shown that oral administration is less efficient and usually induces no detectable fecal HEV shedding. the etiology of most forms of glomerulonephritis is likely infection (43). the detection of HEV RNA and proteins in M1\u2019s kidney suggests direct viral replication in renal cells may also play a role. cynomolgus monkeys were housed in adjoining individual cages. fresh fecal samples were collected from adult camels in four different provinces/regions in china. samples were taken from domestic camels in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (25 samples), Gansu (40 samples), Hebei (200 samples from 2 farms) two 5-year-old female cynomolgus monkeys were negative for HEV RNA and anti-HEV IgM/IgG for two consecutive weeks prior to inoculation. each monkey was inoculated intravenously with 5 ml of inocula. three complete genomes of the HEV8 from the fecal sample collected from Gansu province (BcHEV-GP) and the two monkeys that were inoculated with the filtered fecal sample containing BcHEV-GP (M1 and M2) were amplified and sequenced using the RNA extracted directly from the original fecal specimens of the camel and monkeys. the optimal substitution model for each ORF was selected by MEGA 6.0 (46) the mean amino acid genetic distances (p-distance) based on the concatenated ORF1/ORF2 excluding the HVR between BcHEV-GP, M1 and M2 were calculated using MEGA 6.0 (43). biochemical analysis of blood samples from infected monkeys. Specimens were cut into 3- to 4-m serial sections. slides were stained with hematoxylin-eosin and subjected to histopathological microscopic examination. fresh fecal samples were collected from adult camels in four different provinces/regions in china. samples were taken from domestic camels in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. 20 milk samples were collected from the 40 animals in Gansu province. two 5-year-old female cynomolgus monkeys were negative for HEV RNA and anti-HEV IgM/IgG for two consecutive weeks prior to inoculation. each monkey was inoculated intravenously with 5 ml of inocula. three complete genomes of the HEV8 from the fecal sample collected from Gansu province (BcHEV-GP) and the two monkeys that were inoculated with the filtered fecal sample were amplified. the RNA was converted to cDNA by a combined random priming and oligo(dT) priming strategy. the 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the SMARTer 5 the mean amino acid genetic distances (p-distance) based on the concatenated ORF1/ORF2 excluding the HVR between BcHEV-GP, M1 and M2 and other HEV genotypes were calculated using MEGA 6.0 (43). biochemical analysis of blood samples from infected monkeys. Approximately 100 mg of the fresh tissue or organs collected was homogenized in 1 ml of TRIzol reagent. the supernatants from this centrifugation were harvested and stored at 80\u00b0C for later RT-qPCR."}
