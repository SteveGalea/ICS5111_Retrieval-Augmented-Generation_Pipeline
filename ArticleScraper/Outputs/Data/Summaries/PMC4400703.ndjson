{"summary": "in this cross-sectional study, patients aged 80 years with symptoms of ARTI were studied. Mean age of studied population was 29.9 18.5 (range: 0.2-80). symptoms such as sore throat (86.3%), coryza (68.0%) and dry cough (54.3%) were the most common symptoms in all studied groups. it is estimated that ARTIs are related to 112,900,000 disability adjusted life years and 325 million deaths. the most common causative agents of ARTIs are viruses. the aim of the present study was to determine the epidemiologic feature of ARTIs in Isfahan regarding its clinical manifestation and most common pathogens related to the disease. patients aged 80 years with symptoms of ARTI diagnosed in two pediatric and 8 general clinics affiliated to Isfahan University of Medical Sciences were enrolled. the clinics were selected from different parts of the city that have at least 40 medical visits per working shift daily. cDNA was synthesized using Expand Reverse Transcriptase. five groups of multiplex nested PCR assays targeted following respiratory viruses and bacteria, influenza virus A (IFA) and B (IFB), para-influenza virus 1-3 (PIV), human meta pneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enterovirus (EV). nucleic acid from 100 L of specimen was extracted into an elution volume of 100 L by a Magnapure LC robot. amplification was carried out in 50 L reaction volumes. positive cases and type of viruses and/or bacteria were determined by the software of the real-time PCR device. clinical presentation of ARTI includes fever, sore throat, coryza, hoarseness, dry cough, productive cough, dyspnea, red_eye, purulative discharge, sneeze, headache, otitis, diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fatigue, skeletal pain and joint pain. patients or parents with inappropriate coordination in sample collection and inadequate or improper samples were excluded from the study. za virus B (IFB), para-influenza virus 1-3 (PIV), human meta pneumovirus (hMPV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) rhinovirus (RV), enterovirus (EV) were developed. each multiplex nested PCR detected four to five viruses and/or bacteria. each multiplex nested PCR detected four to five viruses and/or bacteria. each multiplex nested PCR detected four to five viruses and/or bacteria. there was significant relationship between coryza (P = 0.002, 2 = 19.53), hoarseness (P = 0.003, 2 = 17.72) and vomiting (P = 0.04, 2 = 11.12) with PIV. there was significant relationship between fever and PIV in children aged 5 years (P = 0.03, 2 = 8.7) in our studied population, using multiplex real-time PCR method, RV was the most common cause of ARTI in patients aged 5 years and those aged >50 years. surveillance programs with appropriate laboratory methods such as molecular technologies with higher specificity and sensitivity would help us improve the ARTIs surveillance networks. multiplex real-time PCR method is a suitable and effective method for epidemiological studies in this regard due to its low cost and rapidity. the most common pathogens were RV, IBV and PIV. the overall rate of co-infection was 4.4% with a higher rate in children aged 5 years. previous studies have reported a detection rate ranging from 43% to 63% for the method. the current study has some unique aspects such as originality and being the first in our region using the sensitive method, multiplex real-time PCR for determining causative agents of ARTIs. however, there were some limitations that should be mentioned. the limitations are as follows; not evaluating recently identified viruses in this regard. all authors have read and approved the content of the manuscript and are accountable for all aspects of the work."}
