{"summary": "macrophages undergo M1 polarization, which leads to the increase of microbicidal capacity and inflammatory injury. inflammatory monocytes migrate into alveolar airspaces after lung infection and are reported to be the main effector of acute lung injury and infection-related mortality. RESULTS CD163 expression on PAM and IM cells was measured by Flow cytometry. results showed that CD163+rate of IM cells was significantly decreased compared to that of PAM cells. gray area represents surface CD163 expression levels in PAM cells (A) and IM cells (B) and white area represents the isotype control. Arg I/iNOS ratio was calculated by dividing relative amount of Arg I mRNA with relative amount of iNOS mRNA in PAM and IM cells treated with LPS versus control. results showed that the Arg I/iNOS ratio in both PAM and IM cells significantly decreased. the IL-1/HPRT relative expression (A,B), the Arg1/iNOS ratio (C,D), TIMP/MMP12 ratio (E,F) were shown in the left panel (A,C,E) and IM cells were shown in the right panel (B,D,F) the initial treatment was achieved by adding 10 ng/ml of LPS (group A), 10 ng/ml of LPS plus 20 ng/ml IFN (group B), 25 Arg I/iNOS ratio was significantly increased in IM cells after secondary treatment with IL-4 or IL-13. a similar result was found in PAM cells after initial treatment with IL-13. a significant decrease of TIMP1/MMP12 ratio was recorded after the first round treatment with LPS or LPS+IFN in both PAM and IM cells. the differential effect of TNF secretion was significantly increased in culture medium of both PAM and IM cells received treatment with LPS or LPS+IFN in both rounds of treatment. decreased production of TNF was found in PAM and IM cells in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13 in first round of the treatment. Arg I/iNOS ratio was calculated by dividing the relative amount of Arg I mRNA with the relative amount of iNOS mRNA in PAM and IM cells treated with LPS versus control. the results showed that the Arg I/iNOS ratio in both PAM and IM cells significantly decreased. plasticity of PAM cells and IM cells isolated from healthy pigs was described by the IL-1/HPRT relative expression (A,B), the Arg1/iNOS ratio (C,D), TIMP/MMP12 ratio (E,F). IM cells were shown in the left panel (A,C,E) and IM cells were shown in the right panel (B,D,F). the initial treatment with LPS or LPS+IFN induced a lower ratio of Arg I/iNOS (P0.01) compared with the control group. the secondary treatment with LPS or LPS+IFN also induced a lower ratio of Arg I/iNOS compared with that before treatment (P0.05 for LPS, P0.01 for LPS+IFN). Fig. 5 shows differential effect of TNF secretion in macrophages treated with different cytokines. decreased production of TNF was found in PAM and IM cells in the presence of IL-4 or IL-13. porcine M1-IM expressed lower CD163 level and porcine M2-PAM expressed higher CD163 level. NO production in mammalian macrophages is known to play a significant role in intracellular defense against a number of microbial infections. Arg I/iNOS ratio in IM was significantly lower than in PAM cells. i/iNOS ratio in IM cells was significantly lower than in PAM cells. i/iNOS ratio was consistent with the results of NO levels in IM cells. the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) regulate the physiological and pathological metabolism of collagen-based tissues. MMP12 is an elastase (also known as metalloelastase) that functions in the degradation of elastin. the TNF production was significantly increased (P0.01) in the initial or secondary LPS- or LPS+IFN-treated PAM and IM cells. IL-4 and IL-13 stimulation differently induced M1 and M2 polarization. pigs and inoculations were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee, Dalian University, China. the biological agents used in this study were handled as per the Institutional Biosafety Committee, Dalian University, China. the experimental pigs were seronegative for antibody to PRRSV. adherent cells were digested by trypsin, washed three times with RPMI 1640. cells were plated in 96-well culture plates or six-well culture plates. pigs were euthanized by exsanguination and pulmonary vasculature was perfusated. 105 cells/well in 96-well plates for 24 h and stimulated with different doses of LPS at 1 pg/ml, 10 pg/ml, 100 pg/ml, 1 ng/ml, 10 ng/ml, 100 ng/ml and 1 g/ml for 20 h. nitrite concentration was measured by the absorbance at 550 nm. cDNA was synthesized by an oligo (dT)15 primer and superScriptTM II reverse transcriptase reagents (Takara, China) the forward and reverse primer sequences were summarized in Table 1. The thermal cycling conditions were set as: 3 min. at 95\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 10 s, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s. the expression levels of each gene were normalized to the internal control HPRT. the biological agents used in this study were handled as per the Institutional Biosafety Committee, Dalian University, China. the lung collection and the pig euthanization were approved by the Institutional Biosafety Committee, Dalian University. non-adherent cells were removed by aspiration and adherent cells were digested by trypsin. cells were plated in 96-well culture plates or six-well culture plates. pigs were euthanized by exsanguination and pulmonary vasculature perfusated. the culture media were collected for the NO assays. NO level was measured by the detection of its stable oxidative metabolite. nitrite concentration was measured by the absorbance at 550 nm. the cells were espoused to fresh medium containing IL-4 (group A), IL-13 (group B), LPS (group C) and LPS+IFN (group D) after 24 h of treatment, the cells were espoused to fresh medium containing IL-4 (group A), IL-13 (group B), LPS (group C) and LPS+IFN (group D) the results were analyzed by the CFX96 manager software supplied with the machine. the expression levels of each gene were normalized to the internal control HPRT. the biological agents used were handled as per the Institutional Biosafety Committee, Dalian University."}
