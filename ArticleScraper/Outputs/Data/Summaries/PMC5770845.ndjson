{"summary": "the new world alphaviruses, which include eastern, western and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses, infect neurons and produce encephalomyelitis with varying fatality rates in dead-end hosts such as humans and horses. humans who survive the initial disease, particularly those infected as infants or children, have a high probability of being left with life-long physical and mental disabilities. clearance of virus requires noncytolytic mechanisms to avoid neurological damage. antibody clearance from the brain stem and spinal cord can also occur in the absence of antibodies. we used mice deficient in either IFN- (Ifng/) or IFN-R1 (Ifngr1/) and showed that lack of IFN- signalling leads to less severe clinical disease. production of IFN- in the brain and spinal cord was first examined. mRNA levels in WT B6 mouse brains and spinal cords increased sharply during SINV infection. expression then slowly decreased, but had not returned to baseline levels at 90 DPI. mRNA expression in Ifngr1/ mice was similar to WT B6 mice. ngr1/ mouse brains (a) and spinal cords (b) normalized to 0 DPI control mice of each strain. data are presented as mean picograms IFN- per gram tissuesem for 3\u201311 mice per strain per time point except for 90 DPI Ifngr1/ spinal cords. infectious virus was periodically detected in individual mice through 28 DPI. but only consistently detectable in the brains of Ifngr1/mice. this is likely due to virus reactivation, but could reflect persistence of infectious virus. body temperature was measured rectally daily, with data represented as the meansem for eight mice per strain combined from three to five independent experiments. daily feed consumption was measured for two or three mice housed per cage, with feed intake normalized first to that of mock-infected mice for each day. WT B6 mice produced the most IFN- (Fig. 3a) and IFN- (Fig. 3b), with levels peaking at 3 DPI. mRNA expression was examined by quantitative PCR and protein production by ELISA. levels were only detectable at 1 and 5 DPI in Ifng/ and Ifngr1/ brains. IFN- and IFN- signalling affected not only the amounts of IFN- and IFN- produced in brains during SINV infection, but also the time during which maximum amounts were made. expression of Tnf (Fig. 3d), Csf2 (Fig. 3e) and Il6 (Fig. 3f) mRNAs was higher in the brains of WT B6 mice than Ifngr1/ or Ifngr1/ mice. mRNA expression was also highest in Ifng/ mice at 7 DPI. anti-SINV IgM (a, c, e) and IgG (b, d, f) were measured in the serum (a, b), brains (c, d) and spinal cords (e, f) of WT B6 and Ifng/ mice. IgG levels increased in the brains of all three strains up to 14 DPI. IgG levels were higher in WT B6 spinal cords at 10 and 14 DPI. ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice had significantly lower amounts than WT B6 mice at 21, 28 and 90 DPI. SINV infection only induced production of IgG3 transiently in the brains of WT B6 mice at 14 DPI. impaired IFN- signalling during SINV infection did not affect serum antibody levels. but rather impaired IgM, IgG2a and IgG2b antibody production in the brain. the percentage of live cells at 10 DPI and absolute number of B cells at 7 and 10 DPI in the CNS were lower in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice than WT B6 mice. the percentage of live cells at 10 DPI and absolute number of B cells at 7 and 10 DPI in the CNS were lower in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice. B220+ cells in the brains of mock-infected and SINV-infected mice were examined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) at 7 DPI in WT B6 mouse brains, B220+ cells were primarily in perivascular cuffs. at 28 DPI, B220+ cells were still present in perivascular cuffs in WT B6 mouse brains. compared to CD138 B cells, few proliferating plasma cells and plasmablasts were present in the CLNs at 7 and 28 DPI. in the brain, most B cell lineage cells were also CD138 (Fig. 7g), but fewer proliferating plasma cells and plasmablasts were present in the brain at 28 DPI than 7 DPI. secreting B cells (CD19+CD38+CD138+) and plasmablasts (CD19+CD138+) as a percentage of live cells (a\u2013c, g\u2013i) or as absolute counts (d\u2013f, j\u2013l) were determined by flow cytometry. data are represented as the meansem of two or three independent experiments. baseline Cxcl9 mRNA levels were approximately 10-fold higher in WT B6 mice. comparison of the expression levels in Ifng/ and Ifngr1/ mice to uninfected WT B6 mice increased the differences in expression at 7, 10 and 14 DPI. B6 mice, BAFF mRNA expression was significantly lower in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice at 7 and 10 DPI. mRNA levels in WT B6 mouse brains and spinal cords increased sharply during SINV infection, peaking at 5\u20137 DPI. expression in Ifngr1/ mice was similar to WT B6 mice. mRNA expression of IFN- does not differ in the CNS between WT B6 and Ifngr1/ during SINV infection. impaired IFN- signalling results in either increased protein production or decreased protein consumption. data are represented as meansem for three to seven mice per strain per time point. cord Levels of infectious virus in the brains and spinal cords peaked with similar titres at 1\u20133 DPI. clearance from brain was similar, but complete clearance from the spinal cord was delayed in the absence of IFN- signalling. clinical disease in SINV-infected WT B6, Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice. data presented as proportion of mice showing clinical signs each day for 23\u201338 mice per strain combined from three to five independent experiments. by 28 DPI, Ifng/ mice were significantly heavier than the WT B6 and Ifngr1/ mice. no difference in body weights was found in mock-infected mice. WT B6 mice produced the most IFN- (Fig. 3a) and IFN- (Fig. 3b), with levels peaking at 3 DPI. production was impaired in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice, but IFN- and IFN- were produced earlier in Ifng/ mice. expression of Tnf (Fig. 3d), Csf2 (Fig. 3e) and Il6 (Fig. 3f) mRNAs was higher in the brains of WT B6 mice than Ifng/ mice at 7 DPI than either WT B6 or Ifngr1/. production indirectly followed trends in weight loss during infection. decreased TNF- protein levels corresponded with increases in body weight in WT B6 and Ifngr1/ mice. IgG levels were higher in WT B6 brains at 10 and 14 DPI. IgG levels were higher in WT B6 spinal cords at 10 and 14 DPI. IgG1 levels were higher in WT B6 mice at 14 DPI. IgG2a levels were higher in WT B6 mice at 14 DPI. IgG2b production reached higher levels in WT B6 mice at 21 DPI. the percentage of live cells at 10 DPI and absolute number of B cells at 7 and 10 DPI in the CNS were lower in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice. the percentage of live cells at 10 DPI and absolute number of B cells at 7 and 10 DPI in the CNS were lower in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice. fected mice were stained for B220 by IHC to identify infiltrating B cells. data are represented as the meansem of three to four mice per strain per time point. Activated B cells express CD38, and CD138 is expressed by plasmablasts and plasma cells. early proliferating plasma cells express CD19, but terminally differentiated plasma cells tend to be CD19. in the brain, most B cell lineage cells were also CD138 (Fig. 7g) CD138 B cells at 7 DPI and of all three cell subsets at 28 DPI tended to be lower in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice compared to WT B6 mice. non-antibody secreting B cells (CD19+CD38+CD138+) were proliferating plasma cells and plasmablasts. the peak fold increase in expression at 7 DPI was 82 rather than 458 in the brains of Ifng/mice. WT B6 mice had higher 7 DPI mRNA expression of Ccl2 compared to Ifngr1/ and Ifngr1/. WT B6 vs Ifngr1/; P0.05, ##P0.01, ####P0.001, ######P0.0001, WT B6 vs Ifng/; P0.05, P0.0001, Ifngr1/ vs Ifng/. mRNA expression of B cell activating factor (BAFF) was significantly lower in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice at 7 and 10 DPI. increased mortality is seen in Ifngr1/ or Ifng/ mice during CNS infection with viruses such as JHM strain of MHV (JHMV), lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and Theiler\u2019s murine encephalomyelitis virus. aspartate or kainic acid is the major excitatory neurotransmitter. glutamate excitotoxicity linked to local production of TNF- is implicated in SINV-induced neurologic disease. IFN- signalling significantly increased expression of several pro-inflammatory cytokine genes. levels of IFN- and IFN- were lower in the brains of Ifngr1/ and Ifngr1/ mice at 1 DPI compared to WT B6 and Ifngr1/ mice at 5 and 3 DPI respectively. differences in virus replication and immune gene expression suggest some IFN- signalling occurs in Ifngr1/ mice, either through the mutated receptor or by another mechanism. type I and II IFNs induce many overlapping ISGs. they produce synergistic antiviral effect against viruses such as LCMV, MHV, IAV and encephalomyocarditis virus. expression of several chemokine mRNAs was more upregulated in the brains of WT B6 mice than Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice. CCL2, CCL5, CXCL9 and CXCL10 all play important roles in microglial activation and leukocyte migration into the CNS during flavivirus, alphavirus and coronavirus infections and during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. mRNA expression of the chemokine CCL1 was significantly elevated in Ifng/ mouse brains during SINV infection. IFN--deficient MRL mice also have increased brain Ccl1 expression, leading to impaired infiltration of eosinophils. CNS damage observed during fatal alphavirus encephalomyelitis is primarily immune mediated, rather than directly due to the virus. different virus infections elicit diverse T cell responses via IFN- signalling. increased mortality in Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice during EAE is attributed to IFN-mediated suppression of the CD4+ T cell response. mouse mammary tumour virus infection of Ifngr1/ mice results in no difference in CD8+ or CD8+T cells in the spinal cord. macrophage recruitment in response to LCMV infection in the CNS is also affected by IFN- signalling. both BAFF and IFN--independent proliferation-inducing ligand are upregulated during some CNS infections. expression of BAFF mRNA was lower in the absence of IFN- signalling. antibody is necessary for successful clearance of several viruses. ngr1/ and Ifng/ mice were previously found to have higher serum IgG1 levels compared to WT B6 mice. the effects of IFN- signalling on antibody are likely due to differences in local B cell production of anti-SINV antibody during infection. reduced IFN- and IFN- production in brains of Ifngr1/ and Ifng/ mice adds another mechanism by which IFN- signalling can affect the humoral immune response to SINV infection. expression of chemokine mRNAs Cxcl9, Cxcl10 and Cxcl13 are all important for inducing migration and promoting survival of ASCs during neurotropic viral infections. four to six week old mice (WT B6), mice deficient in IFN- receptor 1 (Ifngr1/, strain B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Ts/J) and mice deficient in IFN- (Ifng/, strain B6.129S7-Ifngtm1Agt/J) were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory and bred in-house. mice were inoculated with 103 p.f.u. of SINV TE diluted Tissues were dissociated using a fastPrep-24 homogenizer (MP Biomedicals) at 6 m s1 for 40 s. supernatant fluids were collected and stored at 80 \u00b0C. right brain hemispheres and whole spinal cords from at least three individual mice per strain per time point were homogenized in Lysing Matrix E tubes. IFN-, IFN- and TNF- levels in 20 % w/v brain homogenates and 10 % w/v spinal cord homogenates were quantified by EIA. brain homogenates tested were diluted 1 : 2 for type I IFNs, 1 : 4 for IFN- and undiluted for the IFN- EIA. washed wells were incubated with 1 : 1000 HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG2a, IgG2b or IgG3 or 1 : 2000 HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 (Southern Biotech) for 2 h at room temperature. plates were read at 450 nm, and OD values for mock-infected mice were subtracted from the OD values of infected cell pellets were resuspended in 30 % supplemented Percoll. cells were washed and resuspended in PE buffer for counting. cells were stained with mAbs against CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD3 (clone 17A2), CD19 (clone 1D3), CD38 (clone 90) and CD138 (clone 281-2) mice were perfused with PBS followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde. brains were cut into three coronal sections using an adult mouse Brain Slicer. ten micrometre sections were deparaffinized, hydrated and boiled in 0.01 M sodium citrate for antigen retrieval. three outliers were identified in the IFN- protein brain data by the ROUT method. one data point each for WT B6 at 3 and 7 DPI and for Ifngr1/ at 21 DPI. mice were housed in groups of two or three and total feed weight was recorded daily. the amount of feed consumed per day per mouse was calculated and normalized to that of mock-infected controls. investigators were blinded to the strain and infection status of mice. 7 DPI were obtained using the Mouse Innate & Adaptive Immune Responses RT2 Profiler PCR Array (SABiosciences) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. results were analysed using a 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System. anti-SINV antibody was measured in sera, brain homogenates and spinal cord homogenates using an in-house EIA. 96-well plates were coated with 106 p.f.u. PEG-purified SINV in coating buffer (50 mM NaHCO3, pH 9.6) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. plates were blocked with PBS\u20130.05 % Tween 20 + 10 % FBS (PBST-10 % FBS) for 2 cells were pelleted by centrifugation and red blood cells were lysed using ammonium chloride (Sigma-Aldrich) remaining cells were filtered through another 70 m strainer, pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended in PBS + 2 mM EDTA (PE buffer) for counting. cells were stained with mAbs against CD45 (clone 30-F11), CD3 (clone 17A2), CD19 (clone 1D3), CD38 (clone 90) and CD138 (clone 281-2) cells were run on a BD FACSCanto II cytometer using BD FACSCanto II cytometer. mice were perfused with PBS followed by 4 % paraformaldehyde, and brains were removed 300 in PBS + 5 % NGS + 0.04 % Triton-X; Vector Labs) for 30 min. avidin\u2013biotin complex (VECTASTAIN Elite ABC kit; Vector Labs) for 40 min. brains collected from uninfected, PBS-inoculated mice at 3 and 5 DPI."}
