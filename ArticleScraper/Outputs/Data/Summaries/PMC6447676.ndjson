{"summary": "1918 flu pandemic was one of the worst catastrophes of the twentieth century. in the 100 years that have passed since the Spanish flu first besieged the world, no pandemic has approached its magnitude of fatality over such a short period. despite its track record, whether the global health system can provide effective protection against an expanding array of infectious disease threats has been called into question. to address emerging global challenges with regard to infectious disease and associated social and economic risks, we propose the formation of a multidisciplinary Global Technical Council on Infectious Disease Threats. the Council would strengthen the global health system by doing: (1) improving collaboration and coordination across relevant organizations; (2) filling in knowledge gaps with respect to (for example) infectious disease surveillance, research and development needs, financing models, supply chain logistics. pandemics, epidemics, and pandemics of the last century. 1918\u20131920 influenza (Spanish flu) Worldwide 500 million cases and 30 to 100 million deaths The Spanish flu claimed the lives of 2\u20135% of world's population, far exceeding the death toll of WWI. 2002\u20132003 SARS Originated in China, spread to 37 countries 8,098 cases and 774 deaths International business travel allowed the SARS virus to spread quickly across continents. the pork industry also suffered losses, even though eating pork products posed no risk. the top prioritization criteria considered were potential for human transmission, availability of medical countermeasures, severity or case fatality rate, the human/animal interface, other factors (not defined), the public health context of the affected area, potential societal impacts, and the evolutionary potential. no vaccine available; Ribavirin provides some treatment benefit (27) Ebola virus disease Hemorrhagic fever caused by virus transmitted from wild animals, with case-fatality rate of up to 90% (50% is average) no vaccine available; experimental vaccines are under development. cases-fatality rate is estimated at 40 to 75% and depends on local capabilities. vaccines are funded by CEPI. the WHO has developed a separate Pandemic Influenza Preparedness Framework (42). the drugs that helped produce miraculous declines in infectious disease mortality are now beginning to lose their effectiveness. the proliferation of superbugs is making the world an increasingly risky place. the global health community must acknowledge the real threat posed by the possibility of a human-caused infectious disease outbreak. in 1993, the Japanese doomsday cult sprayed anthrax spores from the top of a cooling tower in a failed attempt to start an epidemic. in 2001, an attacker with unknown motives caused terror and chaos in the united states by mailing letters laced with anthrax to the offices of two senators and multiple members of the media. in 2014, an accident involving live anthrax bacteria at the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention potentially exposed dozens of workers to the pathogen (49). as long as stores of dangerous pathogens, such as anthrax and smallpox, are maintained (for research purposes), the potential for a damaging accident or intentional attack will remain. a ban imposed by the eu on the export of beef in the united kingdom lasted for 10 years following the identification of a mad cow disease outbreak in the united kingdom. travel and tourism to regions affected by outbreaks are also likely to decline, as has happened in Brazil and several southeast Asian countries when dengue incidence spiked (55\u201358). some level of decreased productivity is almost certain to be a consequence of AMR's health impact. in some economies, reductions in livestock output due to the spread of disease in animal populations could have major repercussions. the upper bounds of existing estimates are alarming. populations of many developed countries are stabilizing or even declining in size. rapid population growth continues in regions where infectious disease outbreaks are likely to originate. the population of sub-saharan africa, for example, is increasing at a rate of 2.65% per year. globalization compounds the risks posed by the above challenges. many diseases with epidemic potential can be transmitted rapidly, both within and across countries. the proliferation and ease of international air travel and trade increase the difficulty and importance of containing outbreaks in their early phases. there are numerous economic and political challenges to implementing the measures needed to prepare for and respond to infectious disease threats. the likelihood of any single infectious agent sparking an epidemic is relatively low, even if the aggregate risk is high. the magnitude of these threats is not immediately obvious to many policymakers nor to the general public. there are established financing issues for global public goods, such as vaccines, to fight epidemics. for-profit pharmaceutical companies are unlikely to invest in R&D of a product unless it promises a substantial return on investment. there are also scientific and economic barriers specific to the development of effective responses to AMR. a number of organizations and entities are in place to help protect the world from calamity. the 2014 Ebola crisis highlighted significant gaps between the WHO's intended functions and its real-world effectiveness as a protector of global health security. a vacuum still remains when it comes to the critical role of coordination. the GHSA is a partnership of over 64 countries, international organizations, and non-governmental stakeholders. the GHSA is a welcome addition to the global health landscape. the GHSA is yet another entity focused only on a portion of epidemic disease management. there is reason to question whether CARB-X has enough funding to make a meaningful impact on the anticipated global AMR burden. research must target pathogens on the AMR priority pathogen lists established by the WHO and the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention. a standing multidisciplinary global Technical Council on Infectious Disease Threats proposes the formation of a standing multidisciplinary global technical council. the Council would focus explicitly on volatile infectious disease threats as opposed to more stable and predictable global health challenges (e.g., endemic disease) the global Technical Council on Infectious Disease Threats would be technical. it would be staffed by a multidisciplinary team of experts working full time. it would identify gaps in disease surveillance, outbreak readiness, basic research on pathogens, R&D, international law, politics, biostatistics and modeling, supply chain management and clinical trial design. the Council would foster coordination and collaboration among existing organizations. this coordinating role may be especially impactful with regard to an established but fragmented network of pandemic preparedness funds that appear to overlap in remit. the Council may advocate for innovative financing collaborations like the recently established partnership between CEPI, Gavi, the Government of Norway, and the International Finance Facility for Immunization. the need for the Technical Council; and (3) establish a comprehensive strategy for the Council's funding, structure, and initial plan of action. if housed within the WHO, the purely technical and apolitical nature of the body would bolster the legitimacy of WHO recommendations and activities with regard to infectious disease threats. author contributions All authors listed have made a substantial, direct and intellectual contribution to the work, and
