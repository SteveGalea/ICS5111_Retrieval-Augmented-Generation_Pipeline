{"summary": "a zoonotic virus reservoir has been considered a vertebrate species. it develops a persistent infection in the absence of pathology or loss of function. epidemiological significance of these observations is unclear. members of the order Bunyavirales are divided into eight families. four of them pose threats to public health and veterinary medicine. the order Bunyavirales is divided into eight families. tis daubentonii, Myotis blythii, Nyctalus noctula Unidentified species (France) Issyk-Kul (IKV) Nyctalus noctula, Myotis blythii, Vespertilio serotinus; Argasid ticks collected from Vespertilio pipstrellus, V. serotinus, Nyactulus noctula unidentified bat Anoura geoffroyi, Carollia perspicillata, Artibeus literatus [25,32] Kaeng Khoi Virus (KKV) Chaerephon plicata Taphazous theobaldi, Chaerephon plicata [21,22,48,49] Manzanilla virus (MANV) Molossus ater [25] Restan virus (RESV) Artibeus literatus, CCHFV is transmitted by ticks in genera Rhipicephalus and Hyalomma. neither live virus nor nucleic acid of CCHFV has been detected from bats. serologic evidence suggests past infection of populations of bats across a diverse geographic range. Kaeng Khoi virus has been isolated from cimicid bugs (Order: Hemiptera, Family: Cimicidae) and wrinkle-lipped bats (Tadarida plicata) in caves in Thailand. KKV has been implicated in the case of several mine workers who reported illness and were discovered to have seroconverted. the genus Phlebovirus (family Phenuiviridae) of importance to human and animal health include Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) bats of the species Miniopterus schreibersii (n = 1) and Eptesicus capensis (n = 2) were experimentally infected with RVFV and the M. schreibersii bat\u2019s urine and liver tested positive for anti CCHFV is transmitted by ticks in genera Rhipicephalus and Hyalomma. CCHFV is transmitted by ticks in genera Rhipicephalus and Hyalomma. serologic evidence suggests past infection of populations of bats across a diverse geographic range. KKV has been implicated in the case of several mine workers who reported illness. cimicids may play a role in vectoring virus between bat and human hosts. no experimental data have been generated to address this hypothesis. importance to human and animal health include Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) importance to human and animal health include thrombocytopenia syndrome virus (SFTSV) Viruses associated with family Flaviviridae that do not appear to utilize an arthropod vector are descried in Table 2. species with published results describing virus isolation, molecular evidence or seroconversion to species in genus Flavivirus (family Flaviviridae) anoura geoffroyi, Artibeus cinereus, Artibeus literatus, Carollia perspicillata, Molossus ater, Molossus molossus, Phyllostomus hastatus, Pteronotus davyi, Pteronotus parnellii, Sturnira spp., Pteropus gouldii, Molossus sinaloae, lecto, Cynopterus sphinx Rousettus leschenaultia, Taphozous melanopogon, miniopterus fuliginosus, Myotis macrodactylus, miniopterus shreibersii, Eptesicus fuscus, Genera Hipposideros and Miniopterus, Pteropus giganteus, Murina leucogaster, Megaderma lyra, Cynopterus s us pumilus, Pteropus gouldi, Pteropus scapulatus, Pteropus spp. [78,102,110,111] Ntaya virus (NTAV) Eidolon helvum, Rousettus sp. usutu virus (YFV) Rousettus leschenaultia, Rousettus aegyptiacus Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis lucifugas, Myotis septentrionalis, Eidolon helvum, Epomophorous minor, Pteropus scapulatus, Tadarida pumila.

Kading et al. detected a significant neutralizing antibody titer against YFV in one Egyptian rousette bat in 2012. it is unclear how ZIKAV could circulate in bat populations. bats from three species were assayed by PRNT using WNV, SLEV, and DENV 1\u20134, and 26 were positive for flavivirus-specific antibodies. none of the titers exceeded 80, and all samples were negative when tested for flavivirus nucleic acid by RT-PCR. experimental infections of great fruit-eating bats resulted in low levels of viremia, low rates of seroconversion, and lack of detection of viral RNA in the organs via RT-PCR. a 2017 study by Vicente-Santos and colleagues examined 12 bat species from Costa Rica and found a cumulative seroprevalence of 21.2% (51/241) by PRNT. the serum of Jamaican fruit bats (Artibeus jamaicensis) and Great fruit-eating bats (A. literatus) from Grenada (n = 50) were also tested for antibodies against DENV 1, 2, 3, and 4, and none were seropositive. experimental infections conducted to date are consistent in bats are not likely to support DENV replication and circulation to levels high enough to infect blood-feeding mosquitoes. no pathology nor viremia was appreciated when pipistrelles (Pipistrellus abramus) were infected with JBEV. epidemiological significance of these observations in the field remains unclear. 9% of wild-caught Eptesicus fuscus and Myotis lucifugus in Ohio possessed neutralizing antibodies to SLEV. viremia reached 4 log units, likely too low a titer to facilitate transmission to a blood-feeding mosquito. lucifugus appear to be resistant or only slightly susceptible to SLEV. inoculation of Eptesicus fuscus with SLEV results in infection and virus was maintained throughout hibernation (70 days), with viremia developing four days following arousal. biosurveillance testing of bats in central America for WNV have turned up negative results. two of three bats developed neutralizing antibody titer against YFV. two of three rousette bats were infected but only trace viremia was detected. yellow fever Attempts to experimentally infect vampire bats were unsuccessful. experimentally-infected brown bats were susceptible to the ZIKAV by the intraperitoneal, intradermal, intracerebral and intrarectal routes of exposure. it is unclear how ZIKAV could circulate in bat populations. Kading et al. (2018) did not detect neutralizing antibodies to ZIKAV among 292 Ugandan bats screened. a serosurveillance study in Ugandan bats identified 13.6% (85/626) had non-specific flavivirus antibodies by plaque reduction neutralization assay. 103 individuals from 9 species tested negative using pan-flavivirus NS5 primers. no evidence of human exposure exists for these orbiviruses. Bukakata (BUKV) and Fomede (FOMV) appear to be strains of the Chobar Gorge species. Viruses in genus Alphavirus (family Togaviridae) that have been experimentally examined in bats are descried in Table 4.

(Cx.) are recognized as primary vectors of WNV, Sindbis, Babanki, and Usutu viruses. mosquitoes in the subgenus Cx. (Cx.) are known to be associated with a number of medically-important arboviruses. a novel fusogenic orthoreovirus, tentatively named Mahlapitsi virus (MAHLV), was discovered in bat flies (Eucampsipoda africana) associated with Egyptian rousette bats. a novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Wolkberg virus (WBV), was isolated from the same species of bat flies in a similar geographic region [182] imex insuetus and Strcticimex parvus host the orthobunyavirus KKV. many studies have identified viruses in bats that cluster phylogenetically with other arboviruses transmitted by ticks. other isolations are indicative of bats playing a role in viruses isolated from either hard-bodied or soft-bodied ticks. hus monstrosus identified five viruses: one dicistrovirus (family Dicistroviridae, order Picornavirales), one nodavirus (family Nodaviridae), and two tombus-like viruses. they also detected a related tombus-like virus isolated from fig wasps and primitive crane flies co-habitating with bats. sixteen of 20 field-collected Ae. funereus mosquitoes had fed on Pteropus alecto bats [149] in africa, mosquito species in which bat blood meals have been identified and are known to be associated with several medically-important arboviruses. a novel orthobunyavirus, tentatively named Wolkberg virus, was isolated from the same species of bat flies in a similar geographic region [182] bartonella spp. bacteria have also been found infecting both fruit bats and the bat flies parasitizing them in Madagascar. more research is needed to elucidate the role of bat ectoparasites in spreading pathogens among individual bats. many studies have identified viruses in bats that cluster phylogenetically with other arboviruses transmitted by ticks. other isolations are indicative of bats playing a role in viruses isolated from either hard-bodied or soft-bodied ticks. tombus-like virus isolated from fig wasps and primitive crane flies co-habitating with bats. arthropod saliva has been shown to potentiate arbovirus infection. a reservoir competence index is interpreted as the relative number of infectious vectors that derive from a particular vertebrate species. cell culture also offers a viable starting point for initial assessments of viral replication in a particular host species. the aim of this review is not to vilify bats, but to analyze the existing literature and its support for bats as arboviral reservoirs. some studies have presented serologic data indicative of past exposure of free-ranging bats to arboviruses of medical and veterinary importance. the detection of viral nucleic acid in free-ranging bats does not necessarily implicate the species as an arboviral reservoir. the combination of field work and in vivo pathogenesis studies are lacking. a mosquito-bat-mosquito transmission cycle was established in the lab for JBEV [67] serological evidence from the field documenting bat exposure to JBEV, the sustained viremia in bats during hibernation, and demonstration of mosquito transmission from and to bats. experimental data are still lacking."}
