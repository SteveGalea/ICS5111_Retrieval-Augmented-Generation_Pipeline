{"summary": "a total of 10 CIC-dependent children were included in the mass spectrometry analysis (UTI = 5, UTC = 5). apolipoprotein D, alpha-amylase 2B, non-secretory ribonuclease, CD44 antigen, and prosaposin were measurable by ELISA. there is no widely accepted definition of UTI in children with neurogenic bladders. there is no defintion of UTI in these children, but clinicians rely on their assessment of symptoms to diagnose a UTI. patients with neurogenic bladders who have either UTI or UTC were eligible to participate in the original study. all eligible patients were flagged in VigiLanzTM (VigiLanz Corporation, Minneapolis, MN), a real-time lab monitoring software that sent an automatic notification via e-mail to the research team. five patients with UTI were randomly chosen from those who met these criteria. all patients with UTC were eligible to be included if they had sufficient urine for this analysis. the charts of these 5 patients with UTC were then reviewed to ensure there were no symptoms concerning for UTI. no growth group includes all patients with negative urine cultures. urine cultures grew either fungi or a mixture of unidentified organisms. no clinical symptoms were included in the initial identification of candidates. each 4-plex set contained one common control sample made from an equal protein mixture of all samples in the cohort. measuring protein ratios against a single common control then allows for cross comparison of the relative protein levels among all samples in the cohort. all data from this study is available by request from the authors. the pilot study is a secondary analysis of patients, and residual urine samples, enrolled in other work designed to determine the predictive accuracy of a single protein in diagnosing UTI. five patients with UTI were randomly chosen from those who met these criteria. all patients with UTC were eligible to be included if they had sufficient urine for this analysis. the charts of these 5 patients with UTC were then reviewed to ensure there were no symptoms concerning for UTI. adapted definition of UTI from that originally published by Madden-Fuentes and McNamara. no growth group includes all patients with negative urine cultures. no clinical symptoms included in initial identification of candidate markers. each 4-plex set contained one common control sample made from an equal protein mixture of all samples in the cohort. measuring protein ratios against a single common control then allows for cross comparison of the relative protein levels among all samples in the cohort. r operating characteristic curves were generated for the biomarkers of interest and used to select cut-off thresholds to the outcome of UTI. results five patients with UTI and 5 patients with UTC were included in the mass spectrometry analysis. 10 patients with no growth, 15 with UTC, and 15 with UTI were included in the assay analysis. more than 200 proteins were identified using mass spectrometry. 100 proteins were consistently detected and quantified in at least 3 of the 5 patients. no significant differences between normalized or non-normalized concentrations of either RNase2 or apolipoprotein D. normalized prosaposin concentrations were significantly higher in UTI compared with no growth (P =.02) and UTC (P =.05) both CD44 and prosaposin have poor sensitivity, but good specificity, for the outcome of UTI. aUCs, thresholds, sensitivity, and specificity of RNase 2, apolipoprotein 2, prosaposin, and CD44 for diagnosis of UTI. haptoglobin is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein whose main ligand is hyaluronic acid. it has been found to have multiple functions, including lymphocyte activation, cell-to-cell adhesion, hyaluron metabolism, embryonic development, cellular adhesion and migration, lymphocyte and monocyte proliferation and activation. sphingolipid transport, facilitation of sphingolipid hydrolysis,35 activation of glycosphingolipid synthesis,36 as well as development and homeostasis of the male reproductive organs. prosaposin also exists as a secretory protein and has been described in milk, cerebrospinal fluid, and seminal fluid. saposins play a critical role in activation of invariate natural killer T cells through assisting access of CD1d cells eosinophil-derived neurotoxin is a protein found in granules within eosinophils. it is upregulated by Th2-driven allergic inflammation or parasitic infection. the presence of this protein in the urine of our patients may be related to dendritic cell migration. both prosaposin and CD44 may serve as specific markers for UTI in children with neurogenic bladders. future work is needed in larger cohorts to determine appropriate cut-off and associated predictive accuracy. the lack of a validated way to differentiate UTI from colonization remains a limitation of this work. however, the lack of a validated way to differentiate UTI from colonization remains a limitation of this work."}
