{"summary": "proteins expressed in islets of enterovirus-associated fulminant type 1 diabetes (FT1DM) with extensive insulitis were identified by laser-capture microdissection mass spectrometry using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded pancreatic tissues. results Thirty-eight proteins were identified solely in FT1DM islets. anti-apoptotic protein T-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (CCT5), anti-oxidative enzyme 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PDG) and anti-viral and anti-apoptotic proteins serpin B6 (SERPINB6) and heat shock 70 kDa protein1-like (HSPA1L) were identified. we immunohistochemically validated the localization of the identified proteins in type 1 diabetic islets. the protein-protein network model presented here provides new insights that will enhance our understanding of the pathogenesis of virus-induced type 1 diabetes. LMD and protein extraction Serial 10-m-thick sections were prepared from pancreas blocks and attached onto DIRECTORTM slides. each fifth section was stained with anti-insulin antibody (DAKO, Carpinteria, CA) for LMD, the sections were de-paraffinized twice with xylene for 5 min. the LTQ was operated in the data-dependent MS/MS mode. the three most intense precursor ions for these MS/MS scans could be selected from a high-resolution MS spectrum (survey scan) previously acquired by the Orbitrap during a predefined short time window in the profile mode. peptide and fragment mass tolerances were 10 ppm and 0.8 Da respectively. up to two missed cleavages were allowed for errors in trypsin specificity. more than 95% of the islets had extensive mononuclear cell (MNC) infiltration (insulitis) [10], [11]. case 1 was a 14-year-old boy who died from diabetic ketoacidosis 5 days earlier. LC-MS LC-MS analysis of digested samples was carried out essentially as described previously. the RP-LC system consisted of an L-column Micro Trap (0.35.0 mm) and a capillary separation column. the LTQ was operated in the data-dependent MS/MS mode to automatically acquire up to three successive MS/MS scans in the centroid mode. the three most intense precursor ions for these MS/MS scans could be selected from a high-resolution MS spectrum (survey scan) previously acquired by the Orbitrap during a predefined short time window in the profile mode. peptide identifications were accepted if they could be established at a Scaffold peptide probability of >99%. identified proteins were also analyzed in terms of putative functional association networks using the STRING 9.01 Server (http://www.string-db.org). control islets included insulin, glucagon, and proteins associated with glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, oxidative phosphorylation, ribosomes, and secretory granules. glucagon was identified in FT1DM-affected islets but insulin was not, which was in agreement with previous pathological studies. se LAP3 56 kDa 12 P46940 IQGA1_HUMAN Ras GTPase-like protein IQGAP1 189 kDa 13 P61158 ARP3_HUMAN Actin-related protein 3 ACTR3 47 kDa 14 Q06323 PSME1_HUMAN Proteasome activator complex subunit 1 PSME1 29 kDa 15 O14950 ML12B_HUMAN Myosin regulatory light 1 66 kDa 27 P62847 RS24_HUMAN 40S ribosomal protein S24 RPS24 15 kDa 28 Q9Y3Z3 SAMH1_HUMAN SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 SAMHD1 72 kDa 29 O60361 NDK8_HUMAN Putative nucleoside diphosphate kinase NME2P1 16 kDa 30 O95154 ARK73_HU a protein-protein interaction network consisting of 38 proteins unique to FT1DM, and proteins previously identified immunohistochemically in inflamed FT1DM [10], [11], was constructed for FT1DM-affected pancreas tissue. there appear to be five protein-protein interactions clusters as determined by STRING analyses. LCP1 (red) was over-expressed in mononuclear cells (MNCs) that aggressively infiltrated to or around the islets. many MNCs are positive for both CD68 and LCP1 and appear yellow (arrowheads) many MNCs are positive for both CD8 and LCP1 and appear yellow (arrowheads) TYMP was over-expressed in MNCs infiltrated to islets in FT1DM tissue (I) no expression of TYMP was observed in non-diabetic control pancreas tissue (J) no expression of TYMP was observed in non-diabetic control pancreas tissue (J) STAT1 was over-expressed in cytoplasm and nucleus of islet beta cells (red), alpha cells (green), and MNCs (arrowheads) no staining for STAT1 was observed in control islet tissue (R) weak expression of HSPA1L was observed in non-diabetic control islets. positive staining for each identified protein was significantly more frequent (P = 0.048) in FT1DM-affected islets. IQGAP1 was highly expressed in infiltrating MNCs, islet beta cells, and islet non-beta cells. IQGAP1 regulates cell morphology and motility through interaction with components of the cytoskeleton. IQGAP1 expression on MNCs contributes to aggressive translocation of MNCs to beta cells in FT1DM. p115 (USO1, p115) was densely stained in alpha-cells in FT1DM-affected pancreas tissue. ATP-dependent RNA helicase DEAD box helicase 5 (DDX5) was over-expressed in the nucleus and cytoplasm of all subsets of islet cells affected by FT1DM. ribosomal proteins are vital for cell proliferation, apoptosis and survival processes. 40S ribosomal protein S24 (RPS24) and 60S ribosomal protein L15 (RPL15) were identified. TYMP is a well-known mediator induced by pro-inflammatory conditions. TYMP is a target of manipulation in oncology, suggesting it could serve as a target for interventional applications of anti-cancer agents. TYMP is a target of manipulation in oncology, suggesting that it could serve as a target for interventional applications of anti-cancer agents [29] to the treatment of type 1 diabetes. treatment with serpin family member alpha1-antitrypsin reduces insulitis and prevents diabetes in NOD mice [34] clinical trials evaluating alpha-antitrypsin are underway. 6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, decarboxylating (PGD), a key enzyme of the pentose phosphate pathway, was over-expressed in islet-cells and non-islet cells. in enterovirus-induced FT1DM, HLA class I molecules are over-expressed in islet cells. beta cells secrete CXCL10 [10], suggesting a crucial role for HLA-C in rapid beta cell destruction and regulation of virus exclusion. immunoproteasome maintains protein homeostasis against IFN-induced oxidative stress. PSME1 and 2 will act to maintain cell homeostasis and MHC class I expression. WARS expression is strongly induced by IFN-gamma. leucine aminopeptidase 3 (LAP3) was over-expressed in both MNCs and the cytoplasm of FT1DM-affected islet cells. APOL2 is stimulated by IFN-gamma and exhibits anti-apoptotic activity in cytotoxicity. in the FT1DM islets, 107 proteins (35.7%) were found only in the control islets. 155 proteins (51.7%) were found in both control and FT1DM-affected islets. most proteins have not been previously implicated in type 1 diabetes. a 9 P61313 RL15_HUMAN 60S ribosomal protein L15 RPL15 24 kDa 10 O60814 H2B1K_HUMAN Histone H2B type 1-K HIST1H2BK 14 kDa 11 P28838 AMPL_HUMAN Cytosol aminopeptidase LAP3 56 kDa 12 P46940 IQGA1_HUMAN Ras GTPase-activating-like cytoskeletal 7 KRT7 51 kDa 26 P20700 LMNB1_HUMAN Lamin-B1 LMNB1 66 kDa 27 P62847 RS24_HUMAN 40S ribosomal protein S24 RPS24 15 kDa 28 Q9Y3Z3 SAMH1_HUMAN SAM domain and HD domain-containing protein 1 SAMHD1 72 kDa 29 O60361 NDK8_HUMAN Putative FT1DM-affected islets induce innate immune responses, activates the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis, and induces massive infiltration of autoreactive T cells, dendritic cells, and macrophages. we immunohistochemically validated the presence and localization of some of the candidate proteins, as described below. three immunostaining for plastin-2 (LCP1) expression in FT1DM-affected pancreas. LCP1 was over-expressed in mononuclear cells (MNCs) that aggressively infiltrated to or around the islets. many MNCs are positive for both CD68 and LCP1. weak expression of DDX5 was observed in the nucleus of non-diabetic pancreas cells (H) TYMP was over-expressed in MNCs infiltrated to the islets in FT1DM tissue (I) no expression of TYMP was observed in non-diabetic control pancreas tissue (J) PDG was only faintly expressed in cytoplasm of non-diabetic islet cells (P) STAT1 was over-expressed in cytoplasm and nucleus of islet beta cells (red), alpha cells (green), and MNCs (arrowheads) no staining for STAT1 was observed in control islet tissue (R) strong expression of HSPA1L (brown) was observed in non-diabetic control islets (X) positive staining for each identified protein was significantly more frequent (P = 0.048) in FT1DM-affected islets than control islets. actin-related protein 3 (ACTR3) was over-expressed in the cytoplasm and nucleus of MNCs infiltrated to the islets in FT1DM-affected pancreas tissue. ACTR3 is a major constituent of the actin-related protein (ARP) 2/3 complex. IQGAP1 was highly expressed in infiltrating MNCs, islet beta cells, and islet non-beta cells. lamin B-1 (LMNB1) is expressed in the nuclei of MNCs that have infiltrated into islets in FT1DM-affected pancreas tissue. p115 (USO1, p115) was densely stained in alpha-cells in FT1DM-affected pancreas tissue. DDX5 is a member of the DEAD box family of RNA helicases. t-complex protein 1 subunit epsilon (CCT5) chaperone protein was also over-expressed in islet cells of FT1DM-affected pancreas. TYMP is a well-known mediator induced by pro-inflammatory and pro-angiogenic conditions. expression of TYMP is induced by many inflammatory mediators including IFN-gamma, IFN-alpha, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta. TYMP is a target of manipulation in oncology, suggesting it could serve as a target for interventional applications of anti-cancer agents [29] to the treatment of type 1 diabetes. SERPINB6 expression is induced by virus infection-associated IFN-gamma production and confers resistance to cytotoxic T cells and NK cells. treatment with serpin family member alpha1-antitrypsin reduces insulitis and prevents diabetes in NOD mice. clinical trials evaluating alpha-antitrypsin are underway. viral proteins (i.e., iNOS), antimicrobial proteins (i.e., iNOS), apoptosis-inducing proteins (i.e., iNOS), cytokines (i.e., MIG, CXCL10, ICAM-1, MCP-1) are constitutively expressed in almost all cells and function in cleaving peptides in a non-lysosomal pathway. the immunoproteasome degrades peptides in a ubiquitin-independent manner. in response to IFN-gamma-induced oxidative stress, PSME1 and 2 will act to maintain cell homeostasis and MHC class I expression. HSPA1L is also annotated as a protein involved in type 1 diabetes. all subsets of islet endocrine cell are involved in the inflamed milieu. eosinophil peroxidase is an enzyme that is thought to be involved in host defense in inflammation. in CD8+ T cells and CD68+ macrophages in the islets, proteins involved in cell motility and migration to target islets are over-expressed. we hypothesize that through immunological mechanisms and angiogenesis with bleeding in the pancreas, some of the identified proteins play crucial roles in the aggressive beta cell destruction.
