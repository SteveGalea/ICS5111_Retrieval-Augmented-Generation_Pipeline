{"summary": "the emergence of new diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and avian influenza, the threat of diseases external to the region such as Ebola, and recurring outbreaks of endemic diseases highlight the ongoing threat that infectious diseases pose to national, regional and international health security. the Asia\u2013Pacific region has been the global epicentre for many emerging infectious diseases. the region is one of the most diverse areas in the world in terms of socioeconomic development, geography and geopolitical influence. the region is particularly vulnerable to emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases due to several factors including increased population growth and movement, urbanization, globalization. there are three types of Internet surveillance methods for rapid epidemic detection. existing Internet-based surveillance systems and news aggregators use event-based reporting and syndromic surveillance. there are limited studies on the epidemic intelligence needs of end-users. the survey was piloted on five individuals with infectious disease experience in government and academic institutions in Australia. the final survey was offered in English, French and Bahasa Indonesia. participants were selected from the following countries and areas. the survey was e-mailed to 108 participants from Australia, 13 participants from PICTs, four from Malaysia and three from Indonesia. participants were asked to forward the survey link to relevant colleagues. a stakeholder workshop was organized by ISER in October 2017 to explore in more depth the outbreak surveillance needs of stakeholders. ethics approvals were obtained from the following committees. 96 responses to the survey and a 96% completion rate. 55% (50/91) worked in organizations based in Australia. senior decision-maker 17 34 10 37 5 36 Mid-career 28 56 9 33 5 36 Junior|| 3 6 5 19 1 7 Other 2 4 3 11 3 21 Employment type** Surveillance, monitoring and control of communicable disease 29 58 22 81 12 86 Planning, prevention and preparedness 17 34 15 56 5 36. for following global outbreak news were as an early warning for serious epidemics (91% [83/91]); to inform health system planning, preparedness and response (68% [62/91]); and to inform local surveillance needs (65% [59/91]. global outbreak news sources Fig. 1 shows the proportion of global outbreak information services used by respondents at least once a month. 64% (58/91) of respondents used mainstream media and Internet sources. 49% (45/91) relied on colleagues and 44% (40/91) on health practitioners. official sources such as national IHR Focal Points (29% [5/17] and the WHO Event Information Site (24% [4/17] were reported as other sources used by respondents in the free text option. total number of responses for each global outbreak news source was used as the denominator to calculate percentages for timeliness and sufficiency. one respondent reported timeliness and sufficiency were not relevant to their needs. 42% (38/91) of respondents said there was not enough critical appraisal. 30% (27/91) that the sources were not timely enough. 26% (24/91) that there were too many different sources and did not know which one was best. Table 1 shows the employment characteristics of survey respondents by region. the total number of respondents by country/region was used as the denominator to calculate percentages separately by country/region. 60% (55/91) reported receiving automated alerts, 18% (16/91) followed outbreak news as required, 15% (14/91) sometimes received automated alerts and 7% (6/91) never got alerts. most common reasons for following global outbreak news were as an early warning for serious epidemics. CDC = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; CIDRAP = Centre for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Michigan, USA; ProMED = Program for Monitoring Emerging Diseases; WHO = World Health Organization. 64% (58/91) of respondents used mainstream media and Internet sources that target health professionals. 49% (45/91) relied on colleagues and 44% (40/91) on health practitioners. one respondent who used these sources reported timeliness and sufficiency were not relevant to their needs. thirty-seven per cent (34/91) used the USCDC\u2019s Morbidity and Mortality Report, 35% (32/91) used the bulletin of the world health organization, 24% (22/91) used the Western Pacific Surveillance and Response journal. 20% (18/91) did not find their sources timely enough for their needs. 24 per cent (22/91) found their sources were insufficient. one respondent reported timeliness and sufficiency were not personally relevant. 42% (38/91) of respondents thought specialist Internet sources were timely enough for their needs. survey provides insight into the epidemic intelligence needs of a diverse range of stakeholders from across the Asia\u2013Pacific region. there was consensus that timely and easily accessible global outbreak notifications are essential to plan for and respond to public health risks. consumers preferred global outbreak alert systems be flexible in the way information is accessed and disseminated. timeliness of global outbreak news sources was a limitation identified by 51% of survey respondents. one study explored end-users\u2019 perceptions of attributes of seven publicly available event-based Internet surveillance systems. official sources such as WHO Outbreaks and the CDC\u2019s Current Outbreak List were more commonly used by respondents over other services such as HealthMap. limited access to the internet and computers in remote and resource-constrained areas could have affected the response rate. the study employed purposive sampling instead of probability sampling because of the small and highly specialized pool of eligible participants. we identified a need for more timely and reliable epidemic intelligence in the Asia\u2013Pacific region. more effective sources and methods to deliver user-friendly intelligence to end-users should be explored."}
