{"summary": "a communicable disease pathogen can be transported from a remote setting anywhere in the world to cities on 6 continents within 36 hours. approximately 1700 cases of malaria are reported annually in the united states. since 2015, more than 5700 cases of Zika virus have been reported in the continental United States. an analysis of infectious diseases in 219 countries found substantial increases (controlled for surveillance, communications, and geography) in the number and diversity of outbreaks. increased for diseases with human and zoonotic hosts, for vector-borne and non-vector-borne modes of transmission, and across pathogen taxonomies. 368 Indiana 34.7 182 228 Iowa 12.1 93 941 Kansas 10.2 60 121 Kentucky 29.2 143 536 Louisiana 48.3 128 623 Maine 2.9 17 568 Maryland 9.7 45 245 Massachusetts 25.9 113 181 Michigan 54.8 271 337 Minnesota 19.2 118 458 Mississippi 10.5 51 113 Missouri 13.9 84 868 Montana 1.4 13 079 Nebraska 6.4 62 670 Nevada 9.8 39 077 New Hampshire 4.1 19 334 New Jersey states at the state level depend on the amount of revenue a state generates from exports and the number of jobs supported by goods in a given state. jobs in any state may be jeopardized when a global disease outbreak disrupts economies and could lead to a decrease in demand for exported US goods. the impact of the outbreak on the entire US economy was estimated at $3.3 billion during 2014-2015. more than 48 million chickens, turkeys, and other poultry were euthanized to contain the highly pathogenic H5 avian influenza. the evere acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003 disrupted the tourism, service, aviation, and restaurant industries. in part to help reduce such threats to the US tourism industry, CDC Quarantine Stations are located at 20 US ports of entry and collaborate with partners to facilitate health screenings at more than 300 US ports of entry. the impact of the outbreak on the entire US economy was estimated at $3.3 billion during 2014-2015. the impact of the outbreak on the entire US economy was estimated at $3.3 billion during 2014-2015. the impact of the outbreak on the entire US economy was estimated at $3.3 billion during 2014-2015. the national health security preparedness index includes 140 measures from more than 60 sources. it aggregates data from national household surveys, medical records, safety inspection results, and surveys of health agencies and facilities. each domain is rated on a scale from 0 to 10, with 10 indicating the highest level of preparedness. preparedness funds to conduct mosquito studies, develop prevention messages, establish vector-control efforts, and provide personal protection. if global threats can be identified and contained before they reach the united states, the economic burden on state and local health departments will be reduced. CDC worked with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to recruit more than 30 volunteers who joined CDC responders in west africa. other professional organizations, such as the Association of state and territorial health officials, were instrumental in promoting domestic preparedness and supporting the global Ebola response. CDC\u2019s work to fulfill this global health security mandate depends on partnerships at all levels, including with state and local jurisdictions.
