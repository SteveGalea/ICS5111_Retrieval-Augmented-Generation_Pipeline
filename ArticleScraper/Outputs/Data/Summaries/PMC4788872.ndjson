{"summary": "the model ran for 37 days, simulating transport of cargo from Beijing, China to Des Moines, IA, US from December 23, 2012 to January 28, 2013. ingredients were organized into 1 of 4 batches of samples, each representing a specific segment of transport. Across control ingredients, viable PEDV was detected in soybean meal (organic and conventional) and vitamin D. viable PEDV was not detected in any samples treated with LA or MCFA. results demonstrate the ability of PEDV to survive in a subset of feed ingredients."}
