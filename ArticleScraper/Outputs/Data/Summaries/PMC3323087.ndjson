{"summary": "study Stool samples containing high concentrations of Cyclospora oocysts were collected from persons with cyclosporiasis in Haiti and the united states. informed consent was obtained from persons providing the specimens. bHousehold bleach (5.25% sodium hypochlorite) was used for disinfection. sodium thiosulfate (0.01%\u20130.1%) was used to inactivate residual bleach in the inocula. each candidate inoculum was tested for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., Campylobacter spp., Yersinia spp., Mycobacterium spp., Escherichia ovirus, Coronavirus, Astrovirus, Rotavirus, Norovirus, HIV, Clostridium difficile toxin, enterotoxin, and intestinal parasites were tested. if serum from a Cyclospora-positive stool donor tested positive for any of the above, oocysts from that person were not used in the human challenge study. this safety-testing protocol was reviewed and approved by both the University of North Carolina School of Medicine IRB and the CDC volunteers provided blood and saliva specimens weekly for 6 weeks and at weeks 8 and 16 postdosing. study results were a) shedding Cyclospora oocysts in stool; b) frequency, weight, color, and consistency of stool; and c) clinical symptoms of gastroenteritis: diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, myalgia, headache, fever, chills, or fatigue. no conclusive evidence based on clinical or parasitologic diagnostic procedures showed that any volunteers became infected. our results are consistent with other researchers\u2019 inability to establish C. cayetanensis infection in a wide variety of animal models. nucleotide sequence variability in the first internal transcribed spacer regions within C. cayetanensis from different geographic origins has been observed. the 50% infectious dose (ID50) differed (from 9 to 1,042 oocysts), depending on the isolate used in the study. differences in virulence characteristics of C. cayetanensis isolates appear not to have been a major factor in failing to establish infection. nature occurring Cyclospora oocysts may survive for extended periods in the environment. conditions necessary for Cyclospora to become infectious were probably not achieved in preparing and storing the oocysts. future studies are necessary to examine individual and combined effects of temperature, humidity, storage media, and disinfection on the survival, viability, and infectivity of stored Cyclospora oocysts."}
