{"summary": "pig global immune response analysis showed interconnected canonical pathways involved in regulation of translation and mitochondrial energy metabolism. the host specific response to PRRSV infection engendered the activation of well-defined canonical pathways in response to pathogens. the most significant transcription factor potentially involved in this analysis was HMGB1 which is required for the innate recognition of viral nucleic acids. other transcription factors like interferon regulatory factors IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 were also involved in the pig specific response to PRRSV infection. the powerful statistical approach led us to consolidate previous findings and to gain new insights into the pig immune response either to common stimuli or specifically to PRRSV infection. pigs are increasingly used as biomedical models for diseases [16]. pigs are increasingly used as biomedical models for diseases. pig immune system consists of innate and adaptive immunity [17] PRRSV is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded positive-sense RNA molecule of 14.5 kb. it encodes nine viral proteins: a membrane-spanning (M) protein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, glycoproteins (GPs) and non-structural proteins. the results of this first study determined the most common mechanisms of the pig immune response using very heterogeneous datasets. the shared mechanisms will be referred to as the pig global immune response in this report. this study elucidated possible general host-response mechanisms and specific mechanisms in response to PRRSV. we used the software Pointillist (http://magnet.systemsbiology.net/software/Pointillist[10,11]) to perform meta-analysis of pig microarray data. the software is highly suitable for integrating heterogeneous datasets. the results are the p-values of each addressed element. Pointillist classifies elements as \u201caffected\u201d if the element\u2019s p-value is below a chosen threshold alpha (0.05 in this study) or \u201cnon-affected\u201d otherwise. combining effective significances is calculated by weighting, normalizing, transforming, and combining the element\u2019s specific p-values into one single element significance using a Fisher-like transformation. meta-analyses using bioconductor \"simpleaffy\" package [36] combined with a customized R/Python to perform a co-expression clustering analysis. array elements used in this analysis were matched with the Iowa Porcine Assembly (IwPA) which consist of 140087 consensus sequences (contigs), called the Iowa Tentative Consensus (ITC), and 103888 singletons [38]. we used the default IPA \u201cuniverse\u201d which contain all genes and endogenous chemicals of the IPA library. to confirm our functional analysis, we used an additional approach in which we performed co-expression analysis of only differentially expressed genes. the software Pointillist is highly suitable for integrating heterogeneous datasets. the evidences in this meta-analysis are the p-values of each addressed element. this represents the gene expression that corresponds to probes (elements) on each microarray chip. p-values are calculated for each probe having a p-value in at least 10% of the data. the results were set by default 0.05 and 0.10 for the \u201cparametric non-weighted\u201d and the \u201cnon-parametric weighted\u201d methods. array elements used in this analysis were matched with the Iowa Porcine Assembly (IwPA) which consist of 140087 consensus sequences (contigs), called the Iowa Tentative Consensus (ITC) and 103888 singletons [38]. Array elements that mapped to the same IwPA sequence were deemed to be comparable across microarray platforms. 29 microarray datasets that corresponded to 809 chips were considered in this study. for the pig global immune response, we used 779 chips that corresponded to 29 datasets. for the pig global immune response, we used 30504 array elements across all datasets. from a total of 779 microarray datasets used in the pig global immune response a subset of 279 were connected to PRRSV infection. we carried out an additional global meta-analysis without the PRRSV datasets to figure out if the gene overlap between the global immune response gene set and the PRRSV gene set is due to an over-representation of PRRSV data. most significant biological functions identified during this meta-analysis were cell death, cellular growth and proliferation, protein synthesis, RNA-post transcriptional modification and gene expression. phosphorylation of eIF2 (p = 1.03e-66) is involved in eukaryotic protein synthesis and has a central role in stress induced translation regulation. the transcription factor X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP-1) that plays a central role in activating the UPR [46] was altered in this study. the XBP-1 transcription factor was significant (4.06E-09) and connected to forty differentially expressed gene targets. mTOR signalling mediates the phosphorylation of eIF4EBP1 and the ribosomal protein p70S6K, thereby affecting the translation of mRNA. mTOR signalling could also be linked to mitochondria dysfunction, as it acts on mitochondrial metabolism. our approach would rank genes according to their importance in the biological signal across the gene expression datasets without reporting the fold change in gene expression. the co-expression analysis corresponding to the pig global immune response revealed two clusters. the first cluster contained 884 and 359 probes, respectively. the visualisation of the two transcription factors in interactions with their target genes shows that these two transcription factors explain the modulation of three among the five top canonical pathways involved in pig global immune response. also, NFE2L2 and its target gene group explain the alteration of the oxidative stress response highly affected during the pig global immune response. this approach might shed light on specific and particular biological pathways to PRRSV that could be masked by more general and abundant pathways of the immune response. pig specific response to PRRSV infection was characterized by well-defined pathways in immune response to viral infection. TREM1 signalling, role of hyper-cytokinemia/ hyper-chemokinemia in the pathogenesis of influenza, toll-like receptor signalling, glucocorticoid receptor signalling and communication between innate and adaptive immune response. the top five molecular and cellular functions in this analysis were: Cellular movement, cell-to-cell signalling and interaction, Cell the role of hypercytokinemia/hyperchemokinemia in the pathogenesis of Influenza could reflect the similarity between PRRSV and influenza viruses in the matter of hypercytokinemia and hyperchemokinemia symptoms. glucocorticoids regulate a large number of immune processes by inducing transcription of anti-inflammatory genes and repression of pro-inflammatory gene transcription. many infections result in an activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and increased glucocorticoid release that could advantageous to both the infectious agent and the host. the host defence against pathogen infection consists of a complex interplay between components of the innate and the adaptive immune system the absence of apoptosis during PRRSV infection has been reported in MARC-145 cells [66] and HeLa cells [67]. the co-expression analysis corresponding to the pig specific response to PRRSV infection revealed eight clusters. other canonical pathways emerged in this co-expression analysis. interferon regulatory factors, IRF1, IRF3, IRF5 and IRF8 were all involved in pig specific response to PRRSV infection. NFkB, EGR1, BCL3 and PYCARD were among the top transcription factors involved in pig immune response to PRRSV infection. we used 30504 array elements across all datasets to match elements across arrays. of the 1464 (Additional file 2: Table S2-A, p 0.05) unique probes identified by Pointillist as being significantly altered. 1241 (Additional file 2: Table S2-B) were mapped to NCBI gene names and 1044 were present in the IPA knowledge database. significantly affected genes in combination between the pig global immune response (A. 1044 genes) and pig response to PRRSV infection (B. 1442 genes) the top five canonical pathways identified by IPA were EIF2 Signalling, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Regulation of eIF4 and p70S6K signaling, Mitochondrial Dysfunction and mTOR Signaling. the top biological functions protein synthesis, RNA-post transcriptional modification and gene expression reflect the translation regulation during the pig global immune response. this activates the unfolded protein response (UPR) that regulates ER protein folding and plays an important role in innate immunity. oxidative phosphorylation leads to the phosphorylation of ADP to ATP necessary to the functioning of cellular processes. infections by pathogens alter cell homeostasis and cause elevation in cellular levels of ROS. mTOR signalling mediates the phosphorylation of eIF4EBP1 and the ribosomal protein p70S6K, thereby affecting the translation of mRNA. the pig global immune response revealed two clusters. the first and second cluster contained 884 and 359 probes. four of the top canonical pathways in cluster 1 are among the top. the more heterogeneous the data are, the less common biological pathways one can identify. the more heterogeneous the data are, the less common biological pathways one can identify. this finding reflects the strong connectivity between the significant genes in this meta-analysis. illist as significantly affected by PRRSV infection, 1612 (Additional file 9: Table S7-B) were mapped to NCBI and 1442 recognised by IPA. to take in consideration only the genes specific to PRRSV infection, we removed from this list of 1442 IPA-recognized genes those genes present on the list of pig global immune response (905 genes) toll like receptors (TLRs) are transmembrane receptors that bind to specific molecular patterns in bacteria and viruses. TREM-1 has been implicated in the amplification of septic shock by enhancing the (TLR)-mediated production of proinflammatory cytokines. the involvement of TLRs in PRRSV infection is known. lymphoid tissues infected with PRRSV have significant alteration of TLRs, 2,3,4,7 and 8 gene expressions. glucocorticoids regulate a large number of immune processes by inducing transcription of anti-inflammatory genes. we found cell death as the most significant, which included 56 genes. of which 40 genes were involved in apoptosis and 16 in cell survival. this finding might suggest that the under-representation of cell death during the PRRSV infection is a strategy adopted by PRRSV to improve its infectivity. this is the first time that disparate microarray data corresponding to pig immune response challenges were combined statistically to identify common and specific genes and pathways between the general and specific immune response to PRRSV. most of the biological functions highlighted during this meta-analysis correspond to multiple aspects of translation, response to stress, as well as cell death. for the first time, we identified some transcription factors (MYCN, MYC and NFE2L2) that have been revealed to be highly significant in this analysis. the potential involvement of the HMGB1 transcription factor in the innate recognition of PRRSV nucleic acids has been reported herein. arrays datasets included in meta-analysis of pig response to PRRSV infection are indicated in the column \u201cStudies\u201d by the word \u201cPRRSV\u201d data used for co-expression clustering are indicated in the column \u201cPlatform\u201d by the symbol **. two clusters have been found, B.
