{"summary": "temperatures and humidity may independently or jointly contribute to the risk of influenza infections in a subarctic climate. a decrease in temperature and humidity during the preceding three days increased the risk of influenza episodes in a cold climate. seasonal variation of influenza outbreaks is a well-known phenomenon. studies from temperate and tropical climates have shown that low temperature and humidity increase the risk of seasonal influenza onset in the winter [5-8] low temperature and dry air was recently reported to increase influenza mortality [9] the total number of men in the intake group was 1,836 in July 2004 (participation 82%) and 1,861 in January (75%). both intake groups served part of their military training during the winter season. the study protocol was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Kainuu Central Hospital. serum samples were tested for IgG antibodies to influenza A, and B viruses by enzyme immunoassay. uninfected MDCK cells were served as control antigen. a fourfold or greater increase in antibody titers between acute and convalescent phase sera was considered significant. hazard period was defined as three days preceding the visit to the clinic for a respiratory infection. a symmetric bidirectional selection of two reference periods was used in the models. for temperature and humidity, three-day periods seven days before and after the visit to the clinic for influenza were used. conscripts were informed that participation is voluntary and that they can discontinue their participation at any time. they provided their written consent following this information. influenza A and B cases can be identified on the basis of severe symptoms. uninfected MDCK cells were served as control antigen. a fourfold increase in antibody titers between acute- and convalescent-phase sera was considered significant. average daily temperature and absolute humidity (AH) were calculated. symmetrical selection of reference periods controls temporal and seasonal confounding. mean daily temperature (\u00b0C) and mean daily absolute humidity (AH) (g/m3) during the study period. the figure demonstrates that the occurrence of influenza is preceded by decreases in both temperature and humidity. the mean temperature and AH was calculated from the three preceding days (day-3 to 0) of the onset of an influenza infection and similarly for the reference periods 7 days before and after the infection. the risk of contracting influenza was positively associated with mean temperature and AH. a decrease in both temperature and AH (maximal change) during the three days prior to seeking medical consultation increased the risk of influenza. the odds ratios were calculated per 1\u00b0C temperature and per 0.5 g /m3 absolute humidity decreases. we conducted a case-crossover study to assess the relations between daily temperature and humidity and the risk of influenza infections in subarctic climatic zone among military conscripts. guinea pigs are housed at low temperature (+5\u00b0C) conditions. low humidity may improve influenza transmission due to altered function of the host. viability of influenza A is highest when RH is below 50%. cold air causes cooling of the upper respiratory tract and results in vasoconstriction. cooling of the body surface could elicit a reflex vasoconstriction in the nose and upper airways. also inhaling larger volumes of air with low AH causes drying of the mucosal membrane [22], which can even lead to epithelial damage. a study modeling influenza-like illness and weather factors from three european countries has shown that low temperature [9] and humidity [7,9] during the prior few weeks were associated with increased wintertime influenza-related mortality. a direct comparison of the results between these studies is not possible because of the different modes of influenza transmission between tropical, moderate or cold climates. sensitivity analysis showed a similar association (not significant) after excluding the possible effect of an influenza epidemic. but larger samples from equal climatic conditions and follow-up of multiple influenza seasons would be useful to strengthen our findings. guinea pigs are housed at low temperature (+5\u00b0C) conditions and relates this to the effect of temperature on the physical barriers of the host. also low humidity may improve influenza transmission due to altered function of the respiratory tract of the host. airway epithelia favouring influenza virulence and other respiratory tract infections. cooling of the body surface could elicit a reflex vasoconstriction in the nose and upper airways and inhibit the respiratory defence. inhaling larger volumes of air with low AH causes drying of the mucosal membrane [22], which can even lead to epithelial damage. a direct comparison of the results between these studies is not possible because of the different modes of influenza transmission between tropical, moderate or cold climates. temperature and humidity could be accessory or modulating factors for example in the timing of the onset of an influenza epidemic. we conducted a sensitivity analysis which showed a similar association (not significant) after excluding the possible effect of an influenza epidemic. however, larger samples from equal climatic conditions would be useful to strengthen our findings. analyzing and interpretation of the study, drafted the manuscript.
