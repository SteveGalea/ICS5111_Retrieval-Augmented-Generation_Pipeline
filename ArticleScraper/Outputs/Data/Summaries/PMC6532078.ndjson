{"summary": "the majority of human coronaviruses cause mild disease phenotypes. however, when novel coronaviruses emerge from their animal reservoirs to infect humans, they elicit a robust and aberrant immune response. there are no effective vaccines or therapeutics to treat these CoVs. viroporins demonstrate common functional features despite differences in viral assembly and budding locations. the role of M2 in the secretory pathway is to neutralize luminal pH to protect the hemagglutinin (HA) fusion protein of influenza from premature activation (9\u201311) overexpression of M2 causes secretory pathway disruption. IBV EG3 grew to a titer 10-fold lower than that of wild-type (WT) IBV in infected vero cells. a buildup of vacuole-like compartments containing virions may explain the damage to S. two residues in the HD of SARS-CoV E, N15 and V25, have been shown to promote viral fitness during infection. mutations corresponding to the conserved HD residues of SARS-CoV E that inhibit ion channel activity are made in IBV E (T16A and A26F) transient overexpression of the IBV E protein, but not HD mutants, is sufficient to cause a significant increase in the pH of the Golgi lumen. we suggest that increased trafficking and altered cleavage of the IBV S protein may reflect the detrimental effect of normal Golgi pH on IBV S processing. pellets were subjected to SDS-PAGE, and immunoblots were probed with a monoclonal antibody that recognizes S1 (3C7B8) and a polyclonal antibody raised to the C terminus of S that detects S2 fragments. EG3 virions have significantly less S1 than do WT virions, with an increased fraction of a fragment that runs at about 65 kDa. rabbit anti-S2 followed by IRDye 800CW donkey anti-mouse IgG and IRDye 680CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG. the middle and right panels show the signal for the mouse monoclonal 3C7B8 and the rabbit anti-S C terminus antibodies (Ab) the cleavage products are indicated, as are the positions of the molecular weight markers (in kilodaltons) clonal Vero cell line stably expressed pHluorin-TGN38. cells were treated with cycloheximide for 60 min to chase newly synthesized TGN38-pHluorin from the endoplasmic reticulum. the cells were in buffers of known pH and contained ionophores to equilibrate the extracellular and luminal pH of the Golgi membrane. data from a representative flow cytometry experiment are graphed. the calibration curve was derived from data from 3 independent experiments (10,000 cells each) id encoding IBV E along with pHluorin-TGN38 or with pHluorin-TGN38 alone. transfected cells were pretreated with cycloheximide for 60 min to chase newly synthesized proteins out of the ER. transfected cells were treated with ionophores in calibrated pH buffers. we analyzed two HD point mutants of IBV E that segregate into different oligomeric states. the increase in Golgi pH correlates with the LMW pool of IBV E. the same experiment was performed with a medial-Golgi-tagged pHluorin. expression of either IBV E or IBV EA26F elicited a robust pH increase. we found that the pH of the trans-Golgi network was higher than that of the medial-Golgi (measured with GnT1-pHluorin) this was unexpected and is addressed in Discussion. despite intense efforts, we were unable to concludesively determine whether an increase in Golgi pH could rescue the deficiencies of IBV EG3. we used two different methods to neutralize acidic compartments: drugs (bafilomycin A1, monensin, or ammonium chloride) and overexpression of influenza A virus M2. however, the drugs inhibited exocytosis at all concentrations used (during short or long infections), including release of virus. we first demonstrated that when transiently overexpressed in Vero cells, IAV M2 neutralized the trans-Golgi network in the absence of the M2 inhibitor amantadine but not in the presence of 5 M amantadine. the presence of M2 in EG3-expressing cells reduced the amount IBV S at the surface of cells compared to cells transfected with the empty vector. the presence of M2 had no effect on IBV S processing in cells expressing WT IBV E or IBV ET16A. neutralizing Golgi luminal pH could reduce trafficking of IBV S to the plasma membrane and protect it from premature cleavage. both the input (IN) (10%) and surface fractions (10%) were subjected to Western blot analysis with rabbit anti-IBV SCT followed by IRDye 680CW donkey anti-rabbit IgG. the positions of the IBV S2 species are indicated, as are the molecular weight markers in kilodaltons. IBV S is aberrantly processed in EG3 virions. the protein is cleaved by a furin-like protease generating the S1 and S2 subunits during trafficking through the Golgi complex and at a second site (S2\u2032) that primes the protein for fusion with the host cell (24). purified EG3 virions were cleaved to the stub (14). we believe that the additional cleavage in the purified virus occurred during isolation, as multiple steps were performed in the absence of protease inhibitors. we believe that the additional cleavage in the purified virus occurred during isolation. IBV induces an increase in Golgi luminal pH during infection. the microenvironment of the secretory pathway is altered when the E viroporin activity is normal (15, 18, 21) but is unaltered in IBV EG3-infected cells. uninfected cells were subjected to treatment with buffers ranging from pH 5.5 to 7.5 in the presence of the ionophores monensin and nigericin prior to flow analysis. the emission ratios of the biphasic pH-sensitive pHluorin at these known pH values can then be used to construct a standard curve. the calibration curve was derived from data like those illustrated in panel B. syncytia were fragile, and this precluded flow cytometric analysis. instead, we turned to transfected cells to determine if the E protein could neutralize the Golgi lumen. transfected cells were cotransfected with a plasmid encoding IBV E. the trans-Golgi pH in HeLa cells transiently expressing pHluorin-TGN38 was assessed by determining the ratio of the pH-sensitive dual-emission spectrum. the cells were in buffers of known pH and contained ionophores to equilibrate the extracellular and luminal pH of the Golgi membrane. the calibration curve was derived from data from 7 independent experiments (5,000 cells each) we analyzed two HD point mutants of IBV E that segregate into different oligomeric states. both IBV ET16A and IBV EG3 had trans-Golgi pH measurements similar to those of the IBV M membrane protein control (pH 6.95 and pH 6.87 respectively), while IBV EA26F elicited a pH increase similar to that of the wild-type IBV E protein (pH 7.18) mutant was not completely inactive in Golgi disruption (21), and the better dynamic range of the medial-Golgi pHluorin is likely the reason why we were able to measure a significant increase at the medial-Golgi but not in the TGN. the results in transfected cells implicate the monomeric form of IBV E in neutralization of the Golgi lumen during infection and transfection. for IAV M2 transfection, we obtained 40% to 75% increases in the release of infectious IBV EG3. most experiments failed to show a reasonable overlap of transfection and infection and rescue of IBV EG3 infectivity. however, attempts to make stable lines expressing M2 did not yield lines expressing M2 at a level high enough to alter Golgi luminal pH. we therefore turned to another approach to assess the role of neutralization of the Golgi membrane by IBV there was a significant increase in the total amount of IBV S at the surface of EG3-expressing cells compared to cells expressing WT IBV E. the presence of M2 in EG3-expressing cells reduced the amount IBV S at the surface of cells compared to cells transfected with the empty vector. Influenza A virus M2 alters Golgi pH and reduces IBV S at the surface of EG3-expressing cells. some M2 is present in the Golgi region. expression levels of E and EG3 were similar by blotting. expression levels of E and EG3 were similar by blotting. expression levels of E and EG3 were similar by blotting. values for the pH reported by pHluorin-TGN38 in different cell types range from 6.2 to 6.7 (6, 27, 28) cycling of pHluorin-TGN38 is likely to be the predominant reason for a higher-than-expected TGN pH. the IBV ET16A or IBV EG3 HD mutant elicited a pH shift slightly higher than the increase observed with the WT IBV E protein. however, the IBV ET16A or the IBV EG3 HD mutant did not cause a statistically significant pH shift in the trans-Golgi lumen. neutralization of Golgi luminal pH by IBV E and IAV M2 correlates with reduced cleavage of IBV S protein. a current model for the cleavage and function of CoV S proteins suggests proteolytic processing at two cleavage sites releases the protein from its prefusion conformation. this change in conformation may also release the S1 subunits from the coV S trimer (29, 30) IBV E is likely causing secretory pathway disruption in an IBV E ion-channel-independent way. if IBV E were acting as a monomer to elicit secretory pathway disruption and alter pH, interaction of IBV E with a host protein would be necessary. the IBV E protein has been shown to induce Golgi fragmentation as an antagonist of the Arf1 GTPase involved in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi complex (38). a further study of these viroporins outside the complicated context of infection will inform our studies on the IBV E protein. the baseline of pH 6.78 in the context of transient overexpression of TGN38-pHluorin and IBV E protein in HeLa cells is similar to, although somewhat higher than, pH values reported in the literature for the TGN. values for the pH reported by pHluorin-TGN38 in different cell types range from 6.2 to 6.7 (6, 27, 28) the IBV EA26F mutant elicited a pH shift slightly higher than the increase observed with the WT IBV E protein. however, the IBV ET16A or IBV EG3 HD mutant did not cause a statistically significant pH shift in the trans-Golgi lumen. a current model for the cleavage and function of CoV S proteins suggests that proteolytic processing at two cleavage sites releases the protein from its prefusion conformation. this change in conformation may also release the S1 subunits from the S2 subunits of the CoV S trimer (29, 30). this could result in noninfectious or impaired virions. IBV E is likely causing secretory pathway disruption in an IBV E ion-channel-independent way. if IBV E were acting as a monomer to elicit secretory pathway disruption and alter pH, interaction of IBV E with a host protein(s) would be necessary. the SARS-CoV 3a protein has been shown to induce Golgi fragmentation as an antagonist of the Arf1 GTPase involved in maintaining the structure and function of the Golgi complex (38). further study of these viroporins will inform our studies on the IBV E protein. the pCAGSS IBV E, IBV EG3, IBV M, IBV ET16A, IBV EA26F, codon-optimized IBV S, M2, and empty pCAGGS-MCS plasmids have been previously described. the rabbit polyclonal antibodies recognizing the C terminus of IBV E and the N-terminal head of golgin-160 have been previously described. the mouse monoclonal antibody recognizing IBV 68-conjugated anti-mouse IgG were obtained from Invitrogen/Molecular Probes.
