{"summary": "the drugs targeting PPARs include PPAR agonists4 such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone, which are used as antidiabetic drugs. PPAR agonists such as fenofibrate and bezafibrate have shown side effects in clinical use. the polar head, linker, and hydrophobic tail of PPARs agonists could form a hydrogen bond with Tyr residue at the AF-2 region. the hydrophobic tail of PPARs agonists could bind to the residues at the active site entrance, affecting subtype selectivity. a novel class of PPAR/ dual agonistic activity was discovered. s were downloaded from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with PDB identification numbers 1I7G, 2PRG, and 2ZNP respectively. the process of preparing receptors included assigning bond orders, adding hydrogen, treating metals, treating metals, deleting waters, alleviating potential steric clashes. the original ligand was centered and redocked into the binding site to generate a docking box for molecular docking. ADMET prediction The ADMET module of Discovery Studio 3.1 was used to predict pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the compounds. the compounds as a mol2 file were imported into the ADMET Descriptors module and the Toxicity Prediction Extensible and Toxicity Prediction TOPKAT modules. core hopping is a docking algorithm that has the functions of fragment-based replacing and molecular docking. the first step of core hopping was to define the points at which the cores were attached to the scaffold. the second step was to define \u201cthe receptor grid file\u201d. the ligand binding domain of the PPARs was composed of 12-helix and 4 antiparalleled -sheet. the AF-2 region of H12 helix played an important role in the process of the activation of PPARs. the docking scores of these compounds with PPAR and PPAR were higher than the original ligand AZ242 and rosiglitazone, respectively. the docking scores of these compounds with PPAR were somewhat lower than the original ligand TIPP204. 449:1.693 Tyr464:1.758 Tyr473:2.684 Tyr473:1.769 Cpd#4 12.67 12.15 13.15 Ser280:2.085 Ser289:2.405 Thr289:1.849 Tyr314:1.951 His323:3.011 His323:1.896 His440:2.101 His449:1.753 His449:1.891 Tyr464:1.580 Tyr473:2.823 Tyr473:1.590 Cpd#5 11.61 the original ligands AZ242, rosiglitazone, and TIPP204 were used as positive control. hydrogen bond distance (N-HO and so on) is acceptable under 3.20. the docking mode of representative Cpd#1 with the active site of PPAR// receptors is shown in Figure 3. the pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the top eight compounds were predicted using the ADMET module of Discovery Studio 3.1. the molecular weight (MW), octanol\u2013water partition coefficient (AlogP98), polar surface area (PSA-2D), aqueous solubility (QplogS), number of hydrogen bond acceptors (nON), number of hydrogen bond donors (nOHNH) and mutagenicity of rosiglitazone ana 10ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed on PPARs\u2013apo, PPARs\u2013original ligand complex, and PPARs\u2013Cpd#1 complex. the final RMSD values for all the simulation systems were 0.8 nm. PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor; RMSD, root mean square deviation; RMSF, root mean square fluctuations. RMSF curve of PPARs\u2013Cpd#1 complex was similar to that of PPARs\u2013original ligand complex. similar circumstances existed just as with PPAR. core hopping and docking A total of 42,000 compounds were obtained by core hopping of rosiglitazone. these compounds were docked into PPAR (pdb 1I7G), PPAR (pdb 2PRG) and PPAR (pdb 2ZNP), respectively, screening out 23 compounds with higher docking scores and better binding poses than the original ligands. 1.934 His323:2.389 His323:1.935 His440:1.949 His449:1.981 His449:1.653 Tyr464:1.742 Tyr473:2.694 Tyr473:1.635 Cpd#3 13.08 12.26 12.49 Ser280:1.796 Ser289:1.581 Thr289:1.912 Tyr314:2.010 His323:2.253 His323:1.882 His440:2.042 His449:2.925 His449:1.6 the original ligands AZ242, rosiglitazone, and TIPP204 were used as positive control. the docking mode of representative Cpd#1 with the active site of PPAR// receptors is shown in Figure 3. The docking mode of the representative Cpd#1 with the active site of PPAR// receptors is shown in Figure 3. ADMET prediction The development of the PPAR/ dual agonist muraglitazar has been discontinued during clinical trials because of danger and mortality rate of cardiovascular events. pharmacokinetics and toxicity of the top eight compounds were predicted using the ADMET module of Discovery Studio 3.1. 10ns molecular dynamics simulations were performed on PPARs\u2013apo, PPARs\u2013original ligand complex, and PPARs\u2013Cpd#1 complex. the RMSD versus the simulation time was considered as a significant criterion to evaluate the stability of dynamic behavior. the final RMSD values for all the simulation systems were 0.8 nm (Figure 4). the molecular dynamics simulation results of PPARs\u2013Cpd#1 complex were the lowest among these three simulation trajectories.
