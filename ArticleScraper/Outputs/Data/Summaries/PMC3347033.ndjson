{"summary": "FIV is an important viral pathogen worldwide in the domestic cat (Felis catus) it induces a disease similar to AIDS in humans infected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) like HIV, FIV can be transmitted via mucosal exposure, blood transfer, and vertically either prenatally or postnatally. Efforts were made to gather and review all of the available information for each country. Table 1. Epidemiologic studies of Feline immunodeficiency virus from south America. ungulate lentiviruses cause diseases reminiscent of chronic inflammatory conditions. the rate of progression of the disease can depend on the genotype of the infecting FIV. FIV has been classified into five subtypes [30,46,60] a number that should be expected to increase as further studies reveal additional diversity. recent studies identified distinct groups of FIV isolates from the united states and new Zealand. the geneBank accession numbers, names, country and subtype for the FIV env sequences included were: M25381.1, Petaluma, United States, A; L00608.1, Dixon, United States, A; M59418.1, TM2, Japan, B; M36968.1, PPR, United States, A; X69496.1, UK8, England, A; X69494, UK2, Scotland, A; AY621093, FC1, United States (Florida phylogenetic tree of 473 \u2013bp sequences from the V3-V4 region of FIV-Fca env. subtype of the obtained sequences was determined by phylogenetic analysis. more widespread surveys of Brazilian isolates required to determine whether a single subtype of FIV predominates in Brazil. preliminary seroepidemiological studies carried out on clinical cases suggested that FIV infection is widespread in the domestic cat population of argentina. clade B viruses may be more ancient and relatively host adapted and thus may be less virulent [2,50,63]. lentiviruses in eight of these species have been detected in south America [6,10,19,20,33,55,66] the presence of antibodies against FIV in puma was found in Argentina (5 in 22, 23%), Bolivia (5 in 5, 100%), Brazil (2 in 13, 15%), Peru (1 in 5, 20%) and Venezuela (4 in 8, 50%) pol gene sequence of FIV from lions (Panthera leo), pumas (Puma concolor) and domestic cats indicated that each species has a specific strain of FIV. strains from african lions (subtype B and E) differ in their abilities to replicate in feline cell lines [59], their sensitivity to receptor antagonists [71], and their requirement for ectopic expression of CD134, the primary cellular receptor. the prevalence of FIV infection is south America has not been well evaluated. there is the potential for domestic felids to transmit this virus to naive wild felids in zoologic as well as free-range settings."}
