{"summary": "rotaviruses are nonenveloped viruses formed by a triple-layered capsid surrounding the viral genome composed of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. after entering the cell, the incoming rotavirus particle is uncoated, losing the outermost-layer proteins, VP4 and VP7. the viral RNA transcripts encode six structural and six nonstructural proteins. rotaviral RNAs, most probably highly structured viral transcripts or uncapped viral mRNAs, are exposed to cell sensors at some point during the replication cycle. dsRNA induces the oligomerization of the 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS/RNase L) pathway, which catalyzes the degradation of most RNAs, contributing to a general shutoff of the protein synthesis (11) rotavirus strain SA11 VP3 has a 2\u2032-5\u2032-phosphodiesterase (2-5-PDE) activity. ns2 and VP3 were predicted to be members of a LigT-like family of the 2H phosphodiesterase superfamily. ns2 and VP3 were predicted to be members of a LigT-like family of the 2H phosphodiesterase superfamily. the simian rotavirus strain RRV used in this work has been described previously (16) and was propagated in MA104 cells as described previously (17) prior to infection, rotavirus cell lysates were activated with 10 g/ml of trypsin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. a monoclonal antibody (MAb) to RNase L and polyclonal antibodies to OAS1 and OAS3 were obtained from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) Rabbit hyperimmune sera to rotavirus VP1 (anti-VP1), to NSP5 (anti-NSP5) and to a recombinant human vimentin (anti-Vim) were produced in our laboratory. the transfection mixture was replaced with MEM and cells were incubated for different times at 37\u00b0C before harvesting. none of the siRNAs tested were toxic for the cells. total cellular RNA was isolated at different times postinfection using the PureLink RNA minikit. equal amounts of RNA were loaded and resolved on RNA chips using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. viral dsRNA was isolated from the pellet by extraction with phenol-chloroform. the mixture was centrifuged for 18 h at 36,000 rpm in an SW55 Ti rotor. opalescent bands corresponding to DLPs, spikeless particles, and spikeless particles were collected by puncture. oligonucleotides were labeled using [-32P]ATP and. T4 polynucleotide kinase. both oligonucleotides were labeled using [-32P]ATP and. T4 polynucleotide kinase. simian rotavirus strain RRV used in this work has been described previously (16) rotavirus cell lysates were activated with 10 g/ml of trypsin (Gibco Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) prior to infection, rotavirus cell lysates were activated with 10 g/ml of trypsin for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit polyclonal and anti-mouse antibodies were purchased from PerkinElmer Life Sciences. the 5\u2032-phosphorylated 2\u2032-5\u2032-linked oligoadenylates (2-5 A) were provided by R. Silverman (Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH) infected or infected with rotavirus at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer and denatured by boiling for 5 min. blots were probed with antivimentin antibody. triple-layered particles (TLPs), DLPs, spikeless particles, and dsRNA purification were calculated using the Eukaryote Total RNA Nano software (version 2.61) to quantitate the activity of RNase L, the bands corresponding to 18S and 28S rRNAs were calculated using the Eukaryote Total RNA Nano software. the band corresponding to DLPs was diluted in TNE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA) to remove the remaining outer layer proteins of the particles. the viral particles were pelleted as described above. oligonucleotides were labeled using [-32P]ATP and T4 polynucleotide kinase. hybridizations were performed at 42\u00b0C for 19 h in ULTRAhybR-OligoHybridization buffer. the intensity of each hybridization band was quantified by densitometry using Image J. the knockdown of OAS1 and RNase L resulted in about a 2-fold increase in viral infectivity, suggesting that this pathway has a slight deleterious effect during rotavirus infection. the asterisks indicate significant differences between the infectivities of irrelevant and OAS1 and OAS3 siRNA-transfected cells. transfection of cells with poly(IC) induced a clear degradation of the 18S and 28S rRNAs. no rRNA degradation was observed in cells that were infected with different MOIs of rotavirus RRV. rRNA is not degraded during rotavirus infection. the degradation of rRNAs induced by the OAS/RNase L pathway appears to be prevented during RRV infection. these results suggest that the control exerted by the virus infection was at the level of preventing the activation of RNase L. RRV infection prevents the degradation of rRNAs induced by dsRNA or 2-5 A. cells were transfected with purified triple-layered particles (TLPs) or transfected with double-layered particles (DLPs) that lack the outer layer of the virus are competent to start a productive virus replication cycle. at the same time, cells were transfected or not with dsRNA and were then harvested at different times to determine the integrity of the rRNAs. in contrast, when the cells were only transfected with dsRNA, there was a time-dependent increase in a second mechanism activated at a later stage of virus replication seems to be operational. MA104 cells were either infected with CsCl-purified TLPs or transfected with 10 g/ml of purified rotavirus dsRNA (dsRNA) at the indicated times, the cells were harvested and total RNA was purified and analyzed on a Bioanalyzer. the entry of viral particles triggers a signal that prevents the initial degradation of rRNA, and later on, the virus has a second mechanism, which depends on the de novo synthesis of a viral component. we tested whether VP4, VP7, or both were responsible for this initial control. a neutralizing antibody that binds to trimers of RRV VP7 prevents the disassembly of viral particles but not their endocytosis. the addition to cells of MAb 159-preincubated particles prevented rRNA degradation in the initial 3 hpi, but thereafter, an increased rRNA degradation was observed. the initial control of the degradation of rRNA is mediated by an interaction of the virus particle with a cell component. RNA was purified and analyzed on a Bioanalyzer. the cleavage products of RNase L were quantitated under each condition. the arithmetic means standard deviation from three independent experiments are shown. the knockdown of VP3 was the only treatment that had an effect on the degradation of rRNAs, since in the absence of this structural protein there was a clear degradation of rRNAs. in the absence of VP3, but not of VP1, there was a significant degradation of rRNAs. this results directly demonstrate that VP3 plays a role in the control of RNase L during the infectious cycle of rotavirus. the phosphodiesterase activity of VP3 is essential for viral replication. the guanylyl-methyltransferase of the virus is the guanylyl-methyltransferase. VP3 is the guanylyl-methyltransferase of the virus (24, 25) silencing the expression of RNase L results in a 2-fold increase in virus yield. silencing VP3 and VP1 individually decreased the production of viral progeny by about 85%. the amount of infectious virus produced under these conditions was even higher than that produced in control cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA. data are expressed as the percentages of the infectivity obtained when the cells were transfected with an irrelevant siRNA (Irre) the arithmetic means standard deviations from three independent experiments performed in duplicate are shown. the arithmetic means from three independent experiments performed in duplicate are shown. when VP3 was silenced, the amount of gene 10 mRNA detected was negligible. this suggests that the PDE function of VP3 is very important for the stability of viral mRNAs. the capping activity of this protein does not seem to be essential for the production of progeny virus at least in one infectious cycle. the yield of infectious virus increases when the expression of OAS1 and RNase L is silenced. at 12 hpi, cells were lysed and the virus titer was determined by an immunoperoxidase focus-forming assay. data are expressed as the percentages of the infectivity obtained when the cells were transfected with an irrelevant siRNA (Irre) no degradation of rRNA was observed in rotavirus-infected cells. rRNA is not degraded during rotavirus infection. rRNA is not degraded during rotavirus infection. RRV infection prevents degradation of rRNAs induced by dsRNA or 2-5 A. MA104 cells were mock infected or infected with RRV (MOI of 10) and transfected with 5 g/ml of poly(IC), 10 g/ml of purified rotavirus dsRNA (dsRNA), or 2.5 M 2-5 A. at 9 hpi, the cells were lysed, and total RNA was pur particles that lack the outer layer of the virus are competent to start a productive virus replication cycle. at the same time, cells were transfected or not with dsRNA and were then harvested at different times to determine the integrity of the rRNAs. when the cells were transfected with TLPs and with dsRNA, there was a time-dependent increase in the amount of rRNA degradation observed. MA104 cells were either infected with CsCl-purified TLPs or transfected with 10 g/ml of purified rotavirus dsRNA (dsRNA) at the indicated times, the cells were harvested and total RNA was purified and analyzed on a Bioanalyzer. the outer layer proteins are involved in controlling the activation of RNase L. we tested whether VP4, VP7 or both were responsible for this initial control. these particles were purified from RRV-infected cells in which the expression of VP4 was silenced. the addition to cells of MAb 159-preincubated particles prevented rRNA degradation in the initial 3 hpi, but thereafter, an increased rRNA degradation was observed. the initial control of the degradation of rRNA is mediated by an interaction of the virus particle with a cell component that occurs during or prior to virus cell internalization. arithmetic means standard deviation from three independent experiments are shown. to evaluate the efficiency of neutralization of MAb 159, MA104 cells were mock infected or infected with the same virus-antibody mixtures. cells were labeled for 30 min with 25 Ci/ml of Easy Tag Express 35S and then lysed. in the absence of VP1 or VP3 there was a clear degradation of rRNAs. in the absence of VP3, but not of VP1, there was a significant degradation of rRNAs. these results directly demonstrate that VP3 plays a role in the control of RNase L during the infectious cycle of rotavirus. VP3 is the guanylyl-methyltransferase of the virus (24, 25). the synthesis of viral mRNA and dsRNA decreases by about 10-fold. the yield of infectious progeny virus decreases by about 80%. this assay would eliminate the deleterious effect of RNase L on the yield of infectious virus. silencing VP3 and VP1 individually decreased the production of viral progeny by about 85%. the amount of infectious virus produced under these conditions was even higher than that produced in control cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA (Irre), which represents 100% infect. rotavirus replication in the absence of VP3 is not affected. arithmetic means from three independent experiments performed in duplicate are shown. total RNA from MA104 cells transfected with the indicated siRNA was used in a Northern blot analysis to detect the presence of gene 10 mRNA (mNSP4) the mRNA level of gene 10 was normalized against the level of 18S RNA. VP3 was silenced in combination with VP1 and RNase L simultaneously. the amount of gene 10 mRNA detected was negligible. these results suggest that the PDE function of VP3 is very important for the stability of viral mRNAs. the interactions of the viral particle with any of the molecules that have been found to play a role as rotavirus receptors (namely, sialic acid; gangliosides; integrins 21, v3 and x2; the heat shock cognate protein hsc70; or JAM-A) (26) could be the trigger that prevents the early activation of RNase L or the control of its activity. transcripts synthesized in the cell are noncapped and could be recognized as RNA patterns that activate the immune signaling through the RIG-I signaling receptors. a portion of the viral transcripts synthesized in the cell are noncapped and could be recognized as RNA patterns that activate the immune signaling through the RIG-I signaling receptors. rotaviruses have evolved a way to prevent this early activation, until they reach the cytoplasmic compartment and begin to synthesize their proteins. this allows the virus to control directly and indirectly the innate immune responses of the cell."}
