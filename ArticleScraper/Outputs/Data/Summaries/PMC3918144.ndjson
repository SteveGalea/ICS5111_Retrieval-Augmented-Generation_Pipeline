{"summary": "we previously reported the prevalence of the main respiratory diseases affecting a population of homeless in Marseille, France. we investigated the prevalence of 10 respiratory viruses in a similar homeless population during 2 successive winter seasons. the prevalence of respiratory viruses was within the range of that previously described in adult asymptomatic patients outside the homeless community. in Marseille, there are an estimated 1,500 homeless persons, of which approximately 600 regularly use the 2 main shelters. in 2005, we reported on the prevalence of respiratory viruses of homeless people in shelters in Marseille, during 2 successive winter seasons. two hundred and sixty-five (108 in 2010 and 157 in 2011) homeless persons were included. demographic characteristics and disease conditions were not significantly different in 2010 and 2011. in 2 cases, 23 (8.7%) were found positive for at least one virus (16 in 2010 and 7 in 2011) three patients were positive for EV, while hMPV, hCoV-OC43, hCoV-229E and RSV B were isolated. no influenza virus was detected. 8.7% of homeless people tested positive for at least one respiratory virus. HRV was the most frequently virus identified in agreement with previous studies that investigated respiratory viruses in asymptomatic patients [9,10] Interestingly, none of the samples were positive for influenza virus despite the fact that the 2011 snapshot was conducted during the peak period of the local influenza outbreak. authors\u2019 contributions Conceived and designed the experiments: PB, SBa, SBe. performed the investigations: PB, SBa, SBe."}
