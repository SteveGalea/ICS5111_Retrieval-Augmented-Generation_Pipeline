{"summary": "bacterial pneumonia may increase the risk for pneumococcal pneumonia. coinfection with RSV and Streptococcus pneumoniae is associated with severe and often fatal pneumonia. children with viral bronchiolitis with fever are more likely to have a diagnosis of secondary bacterial pneumonia than their counterparts without fever. the study included patients ages 2 and younger who were admitted from July 1, 2015, to June 30, 2017. Pearson 2 test was used to analyze results regarding temperature ranges and pneumonia. results Of the 349 children included in the study, 178 were RSV positive. fever can be used as a marker indicating a need to investigate for secondary bacterial pneumonia in children with bronchiolitis. the literature supports the need to be wary of the possibility of bacterial pneumonia in children with bronchiolitis. literature does not elucidate any way to definitively determine the presence of bacterial pneumonia in a non-intubated child. a procalcitonin less 0.1 has been found to rule out bacterial infection; however, higher values show overlap in procalcitonin levels found in viral and bacterial sources. the data discussed could result in a change in practice for viral bronchiolitis in our young patient population."}
