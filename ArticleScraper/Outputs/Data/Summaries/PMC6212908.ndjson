{"summary": "the widely expressed family of tetraspanin proteins is composed of 33 members in humans. it has been suggested that virus entry involves specific tetraspanins such as cluster of differentiation (CD) tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151, making them putative antiviral targets. papillomaviruses (HPV) are small, nonenveloped DNA viruses infecting the skin and mucosa. high-risk HPV types are responsible for severe human cancers. high-risk HPV type 16 (HPV16) is most studied as it displays the highest onogenic potential [25,26] ntenin-1 complex formation ensures HPV trafficking to multivesicular bodies. this step is vital for viral capsid disassembly, and mediates the delivery of the viral genome to the host cell nucleus. other tetraspanins may be involved in HPV infection as it has been shown for other viruses like HCMV. peptides of CD63, CD63, CD81 and CD151 tetraspanins exhibit a moderate to potent inhibitory effect on HPV16 and HCMV infections. findings suggest that the function of the C-terminus of CD151 and CD151 but not of CD9 is of particular importance for virus entry and infection. tetraspanin siRNAs targeting CD151 and CD63 induced a significant reduction in HPV16 infection rates. tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD151 are required for HPV16 infection. error of the mean (SEM) was normalized to the mean of control siRNA treated cells (set to 100%) error of the mean (SEM) was normalized to the mean of control siRNA treated cells (set to 100%) none of the tested tetraspanin peptides affected HCMV infection. proteins comprising the LELs of CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151 have a weak inhibitory effect on HPV infection. the C-terminus of CD63 facilitates complex formation between CD63 and its direct interaction partner syntenin-1 [16], which is required for post-endocytic trafficking of HPV [40]. Moreover, HPV infection involves the C-terminus of CD151 [28], which affects integrin functions and links CD151 to intracellular pathways [51,52,53,54]. peptides comprising the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of tetraspanin CD9, CD63, CD81, CD151 or a pool of the CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151 peptides (Pool) using 0.5 M of each peptide for 1 h. the cells were infected with HPV16 PsVs and relative infection rate was assessed. 151 peptides and the peptide pool significantly reduced HPV infection rates. in haCaT cells all tested C-terminal peptides showed the strongest effects on infection rates. the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the most effective peptides, CD63 and CD151, was determined. blocking peptides of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of tetraspanins inhibit HCMV infection. blocking peptides of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of tetraspanins inhibit HCMV infection. the data is shown as mean SEM and was normalized to the mean of control peptide treated cells (set to 100%) the data is shown as mean SEM and was normalized to the mean of control peptide treated cells (set to 100%) haCaT cells were transfected with peptides, incubated with HPV16 PsVs for 7 h. peptide-treated cells showed fluorescently labeled peptides throughout the cytoplasm, matching the cellular location of CD63 cytoplasmic interaction partner syntenin-1. in CD63 or CD151, mixed with PULSin transfection reagent 1 h prior addition to the cells. the cells were incubated with HPV16 PsVs for 7 h. tetraspanin CD151 is crucial for post-endocytic virus trafficking. tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD151 are required for HPV16 infection. tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151 are required for HPV16 infection. the large extracellular loop of tetraspanin proteins is a variable functional region. it mediates tetraspanin interactions with other tetraspanin molecules or interacting partner proteins [12,13,14,29,49], thereby contributing to the formation of functional tetraspanin-enriched microdomains. cells were fixed and fraction of infected cells expressing viral immediate early antigen (IE-Ag) was determined via immunofluorescence. proteins comprising the LELs of CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151 have a weak inhibitory effect on HPV infection and no effect on HCMV infection. the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of tetraspanins inhibits HPV16 Infection. the cytoplasmic C-terminal domain of tetraspanins is a functional region required for interaction with cytoplasmic partner proteins [15,16,17,18,19]. Moreover, HPV infection involves the C-terminus of CD151 [28], which affects integrin functions and links CD151 to intracellular pathways. a new tab blocks peptides of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of tetraspanins. cells were infected with HPV16 PsVs and relative infection rate was assessed by measuring luciferase activity 24 h.p.i. the addition of the PULSin reagent increased the inhibitory effect of HPV infection rates. in haCaT cells all tested C-terminal peptides induced a significant reduction of the HPV infection rate. the IC50 was performed without any enhancers of transfection. blocking peptides of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of tetraspanins inhibit HCMV infection. blocking peptides of the cytoplasmic C-terminal tail of tetraspanins inhibit human Cytomegalovirus (HCMV) infection. the HCMV strain TB40/E and 24 h.p.i. fixed with 80% acetone. the fraction of infected cells, IE-Ag positive, was determined by immunofluorescence. we used the polyclonal L1 antibody (L1\u20137) recognizing an epitope of the HPV major capsid protein L1 that is only accessible post internalization and capsid disassembly [27,58], as well as the polyclonal L1 antibody K75 detecting all bound and internalized viral particles [27,59,60] as a control for the total amount of viral particles. T cells were transfected with 2 M of control peptide or peptides. the cells were incubated with HPV16 PsVs for 7 h and stained by immunofluorescence. tetraspanins CD9, CD63, CD81 and CD151 require tetraspanin proteins for infection. CD9-targeting siRNAs reduced the HPV infection rate to an extent similar to the siRNA directed against CD151. a significant reduction of infection by nearly 90% after CD9 depletion makes this tetraspanin an interesting target of investigation for future HPV research. cytopermeable peptides comprised the C-termini of CD63 and CD151 had a moderate to potent inhibitory effect on HPV and HCMV infections in different cell lines. this discrepancy of the consequences of cellular depletion versus treatment of cells with CD9 C-terminal peptides might imply that CD9 affects HPV and HCMV infection via a function that does not involve C-terminal dependent cytoplasmic interactions. the CD63 and CD151 peptides decreased the disassembly of HPV16 capsids which consequently inhibited infection. little is known about direct interactions facilitated by the CD151 C-terminus. the human nonvirally immortalized keratinocyte cell line HaCaT was purchased from the German Resource Centre for Biological Material (DSMZ, Braunschweig, Germany) cell lines were grown in DMEM + GlutaMAX (Life Technologies), 10% FCS and antibiotic gentamicin (100 g/mL) cells were grown in EGM-BulletKit (CC-3124), bovine brain extract with heparin, human endothelial growth factor, hydrocortisone, ascorbic acid, GA-1000 (gentamicin, amphotericin B) for passaging the culture medium was supplemented with doxycycline (2 g/mL) for passaging the culture medium was supplemented with doxycycline immediately before addition to the cells. the HPV L1-specific antibodies mouse monoclonal antibody L1-7 and rabbit polyclonal antibody K75 were described earlier [27,58,68]. anti-IE-Ag (clone E13), mouse monoclonal antibody targeted against viral immediate early antigens 1 and 2 was purchased from Argene (Verniolle, France). cells were infected with 100 luciferase vector positive HPV16 pseudoviruses per cell for 24 h. cell counts were normalized to lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to take cell viability into account.
