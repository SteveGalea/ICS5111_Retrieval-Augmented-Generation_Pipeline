{"summary": "bacterial meningitis is a life-threatening disease, predominantly caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) in children and adults, and Escherichia coli K1 in neonates. blood-borne bacteria invade and infect the brain tissue, resulting in a severe inflammatory response in the brain parenchyma and meninges. microglias reside in the brain parenchyma and are considered the immune sentinels of the brain. bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharides from Gram-negative bacteria and lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria are recognized by pattern recognition receptors on microglia. microglia can also serve as antigen presenting cells by bacterial processing. ocytic properties adjusted to the type of activating stimuli can be further divided into M1 and M2 polarized states. the M1 \u201cclassically activated\u201d phenotype is characterized by release of pro-inflammatory factors. the M2 \u201calternatively activated\u201d is associated with enhanced phagocytosis and release of anti-inflammatory and neurotrophic factors. in recent years, an extensive effort has been put into scrutinizing molecular mechanisms of microglial responses to brain pathogens. attractive targets to manipulate the microglial response include modulation of phenotype switching toward M2, enhancing phagocytic functions, blocking pro-inflammatory mediators, and protecting the BBB integrity. primary cultures of freshly isolated microglia and stem cell-derived microglia represent a better biological model than cell lines in mimicking normal physiology of microglia. ex vivo microglial response has been studied using organotypic slice cultures from mice, hamsters, rats and non-human primates. TMEM119 is the first marker discovered which is exclusively expressed by microglia in healthy and diseased states, in both mice and humans. TMEM119 is the first marker discovered which is exclusively expressed by microglia in healthy and diseased states, in both mice and humans. microglial development and survival is highly dependent on CSF-1R signaling. liposomal clodronate microinjections into selected anatomical regions of the brain have been used to selectively deplete microglia. microglia have phagocytic and anti-inflammatory properties. phenotypical shift toward M2 functions can be acquired by microglia. blockade of receptors on the blood brain endothelium prevents bacterial invasion of the brain. anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 inhibits production of inflammatory cytokines in microglia and astrocytes isolated from mice previously challenged with the Gram-negative bacteria Borrelia burgdorferi and N. meningitidis. anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 was shown to inhibit production of inflammatory cytokines in microglia and astrocytes isolated from mice. microglia express PRRs able to recognize bacterial products. NOD2, a member of the NLR family, has been shown to be crucial in propagating inflammation in response to Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. the role of the endogenous receptor for the tachykinin substance P has been described as a potent propagator of neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity. NK1 receptor antagonists have been used as antidepressant and antiemetic drugs. PEA was recently shown to mediate its effect on microglial activation via the endocannabinoid system, promoting CB2 expression on microglia. pharmacological inhibition of MMPs, in particular MMP9, have neuroprotective effects in rat models of experimental bacterial meningitis. ococcal meningitis was compromised reflected by elevated bacterial load in the blood and inability to clear the infection. in mice with experimental pneumococcal meningitis the polysaccharide capsule is one of the most potent activator of microglial pro-inflammatory responses. a current standard treatment of pneumococcal meningitis is ceftriaxone, a cephalosporin antibiotic belonging to the -lactam family. -lactam antibiotics induce lysis of bacteria, leading to release of bacterial components such as pneumolysin and pneumococcal cell wall, which in turn further augments microglial activation and neuroinflammation. many factors affect the selection of antimicrobial therapy in bacterial meningitis, type of pathogen and respective bacteriostatic/bactericidal efficiency, BBB penetration and antibiotic resistance perspectives. a growing body of evidence implicates microglia as central players in the pathogenesis and resolution of bacterial meningitis."}
