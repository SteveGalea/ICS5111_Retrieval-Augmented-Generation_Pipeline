{"summary": "domestic feline hepatozoonosis has since been recorded from Europe, Africa, Asia and America. the distinction between different species of Hepatozoon infecting domestic and wild carnivores has been unclear. the aim of this study was to carry out a survey on domestic feline hepatozoonosis. more than 340 species of Hepatozoon have been described to date in amphibians, reptiles, birds, marsupials and mammals. a parasite was reported for the first time from the blood of a domestic cat in india by Patton in 1908. domestic cat hepatozoonosis has been reported from several countries worldwide. most studies have focused on reporting the detection of feline hepatozoonosis and almost no information has been published on its pathogenesis, transmission, life cycle and epidemiology. cat survey Blood samples were collected in EDTA tubes during 2010 and 2011. included convenience sampling of cats whose Hepatozoon infection status was unknown from animal shelters in 5 cities in central Israel. cats admitted to private veterinary clinics in 5 cities and villages in central Israel. fetuses from shelter queens brought to the HUVTH for spaying were frozen at -80 C. if the queen blood was found to be positive for Hepatozoon sp. by PCR, fetal tissues were dissected using separate sterile scalpels for each tissue. DNA extraction DNA from the blood of cats was extracted using the illustra blood genomicPrep mini Spin kit\u00ae. a second PCR assay was performed in some samples positive by the Piroplasmid PCR to amplify a larger segment (approximately 1400 bp) of the 18S rRNA gene of Hepatozoon spp. the DNA products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems) and an ABI PRISM 3100 Genetic Analyzer (Applied Biosystems) Sequences were evaluated with the ChromasPro software version 1.33 and compared to sequence data available from GenBank using the BLAST 2.2.9 program. Statistical analysis Data was analyzed using the Chi-Square, Fisher\u2019s Exact and the Mann-Whitney tests. p value 0.05 was considered statistically significant. cat was a patient at the HUVTH and detected antemortally as parasitemic with Hepatozoon sp. it died with hepatitis and pancreatitis and was necropsied at the KVI pathology department. fresh tissues from multiple organs were collected from this cat at necropsy and stored at -80 C. PCR was performed using the Syntezza PCR-Ready High Specificity kit. positive H. canis control samples (5 l DNA) from naturally infected dogs positive by blood smear and by PCR and sequencing of the PCR product. negative controls were run with each PCR reaction. a PCR was performed to amplify a 529 bp fragment T. gondii repeat sequence using primers TOX4 CGCTGCAGGAAGACGAAAGTTG and TOX5 CGCTGCAGACACAGTGCATCTGGATT. the DNA products were sequenced using the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (PerkinElmer/Applied Biosystems) the sex of the cat was recorded for 146 of the 152 surveyed cats. seventy-five were males (51.4%) of which 30 (40%) were PCR+ for Hepatozoon and 71 were female (48.6%) information on access to the outdoors was available for 132 cats. ninety-two (68.7%) of the cats were outdoors or spent a part of the day outdoors. 42 (1.3%) were strictly indoor cats of which only 4 (9.5%) were PCR+. the first cat was detected antemortally at the HUVTH as being parasitemic with Hepatozoon sp. and at necropsy followed by tissue histopathology. the second cat diagnosed with feline panleukopenia had severe necrotizing enteritis and pneumonia by histopathology. Tissues from all the 3 cats positive for Hepatozoon by PCR were PCR-negative for T. gondii. all positive cats had a sequence whose closest match by BLAST was an H. felis GenBank accession. the DNA sequences similar to H. felis included those obtained from the 55 positive survey cats, sequences from all cats from which paraffin embedded or fresh frozen tissues were tested. only 2 cats had DNA sequences that matched H. canis and not H. felis. large fragment of the 18S rRNA gene was carried out for selected samples included in the phylogenetic analyses. in addition to the DNA sequences from cats, fragments of H. canis from local Israeli dogs were also amplified using the two sets of primers. a Neighbor Joining phylogenetic tree based on 345 bp from the shorter 18S rRNA fragment amplified by the Piroplasmid primers (Figure 1) indicated that sequences from 14 Israeli cats detected as infected with H. felis clustered with H. felis [GenBank:AY628681]. the H. canis sequences found in 2 cats from the study clustered together with H. canis from dogs. phylogram comparing 970 bp 18S rRNA DNA sequences from Israeli cats to other Hepatozoon GenBank deposited sequences with Isospora belli as outgroup. geneBank accession numbers, species of infected animals and country of origin from which the sequences were derived are included for each sequence. the early H. felis meronts contain amorphous material without obvious zoites. early H. felis meronts appear to have thinner capsules that widen and become thicker as the meront matures.

Maturing Hepatoon felis meront; A maturing H. felis meront in the myocardial muscle of a domestic cat. the sex of the cat was recorded for 146 of the 152 surveyed cats. seventy-five were males (51.4%) of which 30 (40%) were PCR+ for Hepatozoon and 71 were female (48.6%) of which 24 (33.8%) were PCR+. belonging to private owners, 39 (38.6%) were PCR+ for Hepatozoon. of the 51 non-privately owned cats, 16 (31.4%) were PCR+. no significant association (p = 0.475) was found between cat geographic origin and Hepatozoon positivity using the Chi square test. us and myocardial muscles were positive and sequenced. hepatozoon PCR was also positive from blood taken antemortally. the second cat diagnosed with feline panleukopenia had severe necrotizing enteritis. the third uterus contained 4 small less developed fetuses from which abdominal cavity organ material and amniotic fluid were sampled. none of the fetuses from the uterus with 3 large embryos were positive for Hepatozoon by PCR. only 2 cats had DNA sequences that matched H. canis and not H. felis. none of the amplified sequences were positive for Babesia, Theileria or Cytauxzoon spp. canis HAM-1 F and HPF-2R* KC138531 Cat 9618 H. felis HAM-1 F and HPF-2R* KC138532 Cat 8533 H. felis HAM-1 F and HPF-2R* KC138534 Dog 7243 H. canis HAM-1 F and HPF-2R* KC138533 Cat 9685 H. felis Piroplasmid-F and Piroplasmid-R** KC138536 a maximum Likelihood tree based on 970 bp from the longer 18S rRNA fragment amplified by primers HAM-1 F and HPF-2R indicated that H. felis sequences from Israeli cats clustered together with the H. felis Spain1 and Spain 2 sequences. the GenBank accession numbers, species of infected animals and country of origin from which the sequences were derived are included for each sequence. gamonts were elongated, enveloped by a visible membrane and possessed a round acentric nucleus. some gamonts contained basophilic staining granules. some gamonts contained basophilic staining granules. the H. felis meront is round to oval with a mean length of 39 m by 34.5 m. the early H. felis meronts contain amorphous material without obvious zoites. early H. felis meronts appear to have thinner capsules that widen and become thicker as the meront matures. a mature H. felis meront in the lung of a cat with pneumonia and panleukopenia. a mature H. felis meront in the lung of a cat with pneumonia and panleukopenia. study of myocardium specimens from 100 cats brought to necropsy in Israel found that 36% of cats harbored cardiac Hepatozoon-like meronts. this was the same rate of infection found in Israel almost 40 years later in the current study. studies using PCR detection from Spain have shown diverse prevalence rates. the association between infection and access to outdoors suggests the possibility of transmission by arthropod vectors, such as fleas, ticks or mites. other Hepatozoon spp. have been demonstrated to be transmitted by fleas, ticks, mites, lice, mosquitoes and sandflies. the seven cats described in a case series of feline hepatozoonosis suffered from various other infections including FIV, FeLV and hemotropic mycoplasmosis. proportionally, more FIV+ cats were infected with Hepatozoon than FIV negative cats. this could be due to the small number of samples included. phylogenetic placement of 18S rRNA Hepatozoon sequences from domestic cats revealed that both H. felis and H. canis infect cats in Israel. the phylogenetic placement of 18S rRNA Hepatozoon sequences amplified from domestic cats in this study revealed that both H. felis and H. canis infect cats in Israel. it is most likely that H. felis is the predominant species of Hepatozoon that infects domestic cats and wild felids globally. it could be due to transmission by some ubiquitous vector such as a common flea, mite or tick species, or to highly successful alternative routes of transmission.
