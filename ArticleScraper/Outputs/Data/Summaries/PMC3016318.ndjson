{"summary": "ITIS was used to measure cutaneous temperature in 1275 airline travellers who agreed to tympanic temperature measurement and respiratory sampling. the prediction by ITIS of tympanic temperature (37.8\u00b0C and 37.5\u00b0C) and of influenza infection was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. ITIS measure body surface temperature rapidly, non-invasively, and with no contact, minimising the risk of contagion. they have the potential to comply with the international health regulation's emphasis on containing the spread of disease in ways that avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic. the 'gold standard' test is applied to both test positive and test negative participants in the study. to evaluate the use of ITIS in border screening for influenza, its performance in predicting both fever and influenza infection is necessary. the nurse taking the swabs noted whether the traveller was symptomatic or asymptomatic. nine swab results were unable to be linked as their identifier had not been attached to any questionnaire. tympanic temperature 37.8\u00b0C (>100\u00b0F \u2013 the threshold used in the majority of reports) [15] tympanic temperature 37.5\u00b0C (the threshold used in the majority of reports) [12] a ROC curve was constructed. a level of ITIS temperature with sensitivity closest to 85% was chosen. three airlines agreed to have their staff distribute a screening questionnaire to travellers during flights travelling from Australian airports to Christchurch, new Zealand. questionnaires were collected by research assistants following immigration processing on arrival in Christchurch. \u2018Symptomatic\u2019 travellers were all invited to have throat and nose swabs (Copan Italia SPA, Brescia, Italy) taken. the ambient temperature in the arrivals hall was a consistent 20.5\u00b0C at all times during data collection. a multiplexed tandem polymerase chain reaction (MT-PCR) assay was employed to detect the presence of influenza A and B virus infection. nine swab results were unable to be linked. the positive predictive value of the chosen level of ITIS temperature was estimated. it is not appropriate to calculate the PPV of ITIS measures directly in this sample. prevalence of fever was combined with the sensitivity and specificity of ITIS for detecting fever to estimate the PPV in the population. table 1 shows the ability of ITIS front of face measurement to predict a tympanic temperature of 37.8\u00b0C. the prevalence of fever at each threshold in holders of marked questionnaires is also shown, as well as the estimated PPV of ITIS for fever in this population. the prevalence of influenza infection in holders of marked questionnaires was 1.9% (20/1057) most (90%; 27/30) influenza-positive participants were symptomatic, but none (0%) had a measured tympanic temperature of 37.8\u00b0C. only two (7%) had a measured tympanic temperature of 37.5\u00b0C. 39% 2.8% ITIS side of face 0.55 (0.45\u20130.65) 35.3\u00b0C 83% 24% 2.2% *These were chosen as the threshold with sensitivity closest to 85% in our data. the prevalence of fever at each threshold in holders of marked questionnaires is also shown. the area under the ROC curve; the actual sensitivity of that threshold; and its specificity. the estimated PPV of ITIS for fever in this population is also shown. most (90%; 27/30) influenza-positive participants were symptomatic. none (0%) had a measured tympanic temperature of 37.8\u00b0C. only two (7%) had a measured tympanic temperature of 37.5\u00b0C. afebrile and febrile people from the same population are tested for influenza infection. the low prevalence of fever in arriving travellers means the PPV is very low. afebrile and febrile people from the same population are tested for influenza infection. the ROC result for influenza infection shows that ITIS on their own are not much better than chance at identifying influenza-infected travellers. the prevalence of fever is high in case series of patients with confirmed influenza infection [11], [21], since often one of the criteria that is often used to determine whether testing takes place. no influenza-infected travellers had a measured tympanic temperature 37.8\u00b0C. in this study, no influenza-infected travellers had a measured tympanic temperature 37.8\u00b0C. the probability is 0.005 (0.5%) that the prevalence of fever among the population of infected travellers was greater than 18%. a third of infected travellers were infectious on or after arrival into new zealand. most people who were infected but asymptomatic on boarding will still be asymptomatic on arrival at their destination. the low PPV of ITIS measures for fever in this population means that the number of false positives who would require further investigation would be very high. the PPV of any measures of temperature for influenza infection itself was lower, at less than 3%. governments may decide to implement entry screening, including ITIS, for reasons other than to actually detect most influenza-infected arrivals. risks include the potentially very large opportunity cost of further investigating ITIS \u2018positive\u2019 travellers, including quarantine of those febrile on tympanic temperature measurement pending specimen processing. a review of volunteer challenge studies showed 30% of influenza infections asymptomatic. only 35% of those with symptoms had a measured fever >37.8\u00b0C. a tympanic temperature threshold of 36.2\u00b0C would be required to identify a high proportion of influenza-infected travellers. the prevalence of fever is by no means 100%, even among people with severe symptoms. in this study, 39% of those with confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection did not have a temperature of 37.8\u00b0C at any time during admission. the number of infected travellers was relatively small at 30. the probability is only 0.005 (0.5%) that the prevalence of fever among the population of infected travellers arriving from Australia into Christchurch at this time was greater than 18%. 25% of travel-associated cases of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection with onset in Singapore were symptomatic on embarkation. at least a third, and probably more, of the infected (and afebrile) participants in this study were infectious on or after arrival into new Zealand. most people who were infected but asymptomatic on boarding will still be asymptomatic on arrival at their destination [23] there are no other published estimates of the prevalence of influenza in arriving travellers. but it could be argued that the prevalence of infection would be higher during a pandemic, which typically infects a higher proportion of the population than seasonal influenza, than in this study. influenza-infected arrival travellers had a very low prevalence of fever. ITIS would not have identified influenza-infected travellers even though it performed moderately well."}
