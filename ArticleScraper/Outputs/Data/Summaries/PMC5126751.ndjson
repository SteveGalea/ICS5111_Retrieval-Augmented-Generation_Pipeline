{"summary": "around 10% of the world's Muslim population (176 million) reside in India. annually, 3\u20135 million of Muslims (including 0.17 million from India) embark on Hajj pilgrimage to mecca, Saudi Arabia. consensus recommendations from india and Bangladesh should be relied on before these recommendations are put into practice. most common health problems at mass gatherings are traumatic injuries, respiratory and cardiac issues, heat-related illness, alcohol or drug effects, and gastrointestinal illnesses. a million people are present in the holy places of Mecca and Madina at any given point of time. preventive measures apply for Umrah as well as the Hajj. mass gatherings allow for the intermingling of different pathogens or the subtypes of the same pathogen. as the world's population increases, so will the size of mass gatherings. strict infection control measures should become the cornerstone for limiting the spread of infectious disease. infectious diseases presenting a health risk to pilgrims and local population at all stages of the Hajj include influenza viruses, coronaviruses, pneumococcal sepsis, tuberculosis, meningococcal sepsis, polio, yellow fever, gastrointestinal infections, acute gastroenteritis (e.g., salmonella species, campylobacter species), food poisoning (e.g., salmonella species, campyl the kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) requires three mandatory vaccines. the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine is mandatory for pilgrims. the quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine is mandatory for pilgrims. around ten countries are engaged in developing or have developed recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination for Hajj pilgrims. there is a lack of consensus as to whether pneumococcal vaccination should be recommended specifically for travelers to Hajj or for all adults. around ten countries are engaged in developing or have developed recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination for Hajj pilgrims. there is a lack of consensus as to whether pneumococcal vaccination should be recommended specifically for travelers to Hajj or for all adults. there is a lack of consensus as to whether pneumococcal vaccination should be recommended specifically for travelers to Hajj. the burden of pneumococcal disease in adults is high, with age and presence of comorbidities having a significant impact on the risk of developing disease. the risk factors include smoking, age 50 years, asthma, diabetes, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD), alcohol use, HIV, and other immunosuppressive conditions. nasopharyngeal swabs were taken from 3203 Hajj pilgrims from 18 countries. the overall carriage of S. pneumoniae was 6.0%, with the carriage at the beginning and end of Hajj being 4.4% and 7.5%. a total of 51 serotypes were isolated, with serotype 3 the most common. the proportion of specimens positive for S. pneumoniae pre-Hajj was 50.0% and post-Hajj was 62.0%. of the eighty pilgrims testing positive for S. pneumoniae, 29 (36.3%) had tested negative before departing from the KSA. the phenomenon of hyporesponsiveness is seen with revaccination PPV23. PPV23 and PCV13 act differently. this could be an important consideration while making a recommendation for pneumococcal vaccination for Hajj pilgrims. on December 30, 2011, the US-FDA approved PCV13 for prevention of pneumonia and IPD caused by PCV13 serotypes among adults aged 50 years and older. the ACIP recommended PCV13 for routine use in healthy adults based on following evidence. the old ACIP recommended that PPV23 be given after 6\u201312 months after PCV13. this means that PCV13 is given first followed by PPV23 with spacing at least 1 year. if the adult above 65 years received PPV23, then he will receive PCV13 after 1 year as the older recommendation. new Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations for the use of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine and pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine 23. the ACIP voted to recommend the following: Adults of 65 years or older who have not previously received PCV13 should receive a dose of PCV13 first, followed by a dose of PPSV23 at least a month later. estimates have placed the yearly direct and indirect costs of adult hospitalizations and outpatient cases at nearly $5 billion. the ACIP decision was also based on the positive results of the largest to date efficacy trial (community-acquired pneumonia immunization trial in adults [CAPiTA] on PCV13. COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED PNEUMONIA IMMUNIZATION TRIAL IN ADULTS CAPiTA was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial of PCV13 versus placebo conducted in the Netherlands. the primary outcome was to confirm the efficacy of PCV13 in preventing the first episode of confirmed vaccine-serotype (VT) pneumococcal CAP. primary efficacy endpoint There were 139 first episodes of VT-CAP. nonbacteremia and noninvasive CAP occurred in 33 subjects in the PCV13 group. VT-IPD occurred in seven subjects in the PCV13 group. PPV23 may be offered to patients on return from their Hajj journey. this is in concurrence with the Indian recommendations for vaccination in older adults released by the Geriatric Society of India. there is a substantial economic burden involved with travel to Hajj. the meeting was sponsored by Pfizer Limited, India.
