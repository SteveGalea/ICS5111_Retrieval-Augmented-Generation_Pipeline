{"summary": "microglia are CNS-resident mononuclear phagocytic cells typified by a unique ramified shape and distinctive gene expression (1, 2). Unlike blood-derived macrophages, most microglia are derived from a yolk sac progenitor and seed the brain early in development. microglia are important for neurogenesis, synapse maintenance, and neuronal function. 90% of mice survive the acute infection, with demyelination occurring 14\u201321 days after infection in survivors (15, 16) MHV infection of the CNS results in the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines including type I IFNs (IFN-I), CCL2, TNF, and IL-6 (17\u201320) microglia may be important for limiting replication of an invading pathogen. in cases of neuroinflammation, extensive monocyte/macrophage infiltration occurs in the brain. microglia are dependent on CSF1R signaling for survival. microglia are required between days 0 and 6 p.i., with depletion at later points having no effects on survival, suggesting that they play a role predominantly in the early stages of infection. injury, infection, and neurodegeneration can lead to morphological and molecular changes typical of microglia activation. the top 4 pathways changed after infection were IFN signaling, activation of IFN-regulatory factors by cytosolic pattern recognition receptors, granulocyte adhesion and diapedesis. individual genes in these pathways that were among the most upregulated in the array are shown in Figure 1D. PLX5622, a CSF1R inhibitor previously reported to deplete microglia (34), was formulated into feed that was provided to mice. microglia were nearly completely depleted by 3 days after start of PLX5622 treatment. tCD11b+), macrophages (CD45hiCD11b+), and lymphocytes (CD45+CD11b\u2013) were isolated per brain. number of total CD45+ cells (B), macrophages (C), and lymphocytes (D) found in the brain after 7 days of PLX5622 treatment. PLX5622 was given 7 days before infection and removed 3 days p.i. all mice succumbed to infection. survival rates increased to approximately 30% if the drug was removed on the day of infection. removal of the drug 2 days before infection resulted in 60% survival. mice treated with PLX5622 had decreased time-to-death after rJ infection. microglia are critical for limiting lethality of neurotropic viruses. lack of microglia leads to increased viral replication in the brain. mice were treated with PLX5622 for 7 days prior to intracranial MHV infection. titers were determined on the indicated days p.i. by plaque assay. protein levels of IFN-1, IFN-, and IL-6 in the brain were determined 5 days p.i. images are representative of 4 to 5 mice. microglia respond to infection by upregulating pathways associated with immune activation. protein levels of IL-6 were unchanged in the absence of microglia. mice were treated with PLX5622-containing or control feed for 7 days prior to intracranial infection with 700 PFU MHV. cells from brains and DCLNs were assessed on the indicated days p.i. a combined total of 8 to 9 mice per group were detected. we measured total cell numbers after PLX5622 treatment. no significant differences in total cell numbers in the DCLNs. the changes in gene expression could be due to indirect or direct effects of PLX5622 on macrophages. macrophages were functionally altered by PLX5622 treatment. mice were treated with PLX5622 for 7 days prior to intracranial MHV infection. in PLX5622-treated mice, CD8+ T cell numbers were unaltered in the DCLNs. however, total numbers of CD4+ T cells and FOXP3+ Tregs in the DCLNs were decreased. differences between control and PLX5622-treated mice were accentuated in the brain, the site of infection. PLX5622 treatment did not affect frequency or number of IFN-expressing CD4+ or CD8+ T cells that dually expressed TNF or IL-10. mice were inoculated via intracranial injection with MHV. in A\u2013I, immune cells in the brain were assessed by flow cytometry. PLX5622-treated mice were intraperitoneally injected with rJ. this resulted in a subclinical infection but also in the generation of a virus-specific T cell response in the spleen. these results support the notion that microglia are required for an optimal protective T cell response. microglia express CX3CR1 and can be readily identified in CX3CR1-GFP mice. microglia in the olfactory bulb, a region of the brain prominently infected by MHV (38\u201340), showed increased expression of IBA1. by day 7 p.i., these cells showed a dramatic increase in IBA1 expression levels and a less macrophage-like morphology. microglia were activated and responded to viral infection of the CNS by changes in morphology and inflammation-associated gene expression. microglia were nearly completely depleted by 3 days after the start of PLX5622 treatment. most CD45+ cells isolated from the naive mouse brain are microglia. PLX5622 treatment specifically depletes microglia. no changes in the number of T cells, B cells, or neutrophils were observed. PLX5622 administration started on day 0 p.i. and continued throughout infection resulted in a 90% mortality rate. when PLX5622 was started 3 days p.i. and remained in the feed for the duration of the experiment, approximately 40% of the mice survived. survival curve is representative of 2 to 5 independent experiments, with 5 to 15 mice per group. survival curves were assessed for statistical significance by log-rank test. PLX5622-treated, rJ-infected mice had significantly shorter survival than did mice in all other groups. a lack of microglia resulted in increased viral titers by day 3 p.i. compared with those in control mice. peak viral replication occurred on day 5 p.i. in MHV-infected mice. however, in microglia-depleted mice, viral titers peaked on day 3 p.i. data in A were combined from 3 independent experiments, with a combined total of 8 to 11 mice per group. data in C are representative of 3 independent experiments, with 10 mice per group. cytokines by quantitative PCR (qPCR) showed an increase in expression of IFN-, IFN-4, and IL-6 in PLX5622-treated mice on days 3 and 5 p.i. qPCR of genomic viral RNA confirmed the increase in viral load. mRNA levels of these cytokines were positively correlated with those of viral genomic RNA on days 3 and 5 p.i. on day 3 p.i., total numbers of CD45+ cells were decreased, reflecting microglia depletion. however, by day 7 p.i., no differences were observed, indicating that blood-derived cells became predominant and that recruitment was not microglia dependent. monocytes/macrophages within the infected, microglia-depleted CNS had lower expression of MHC II and higher expression of Ly6C. by day 7 p.i., microglia depletion resulted in a compensatory increase in hematogenously derived macrophages. microglia depletion alters the CD4+ T cell response to viral infection. PLX5622 treatment decreased survival even when treatment began as late as day 3 p.i. Flow cytometric analysis showed increases in the frequency and total number of CD8+ T cells in the brains of PLX5622-treated mice. the percentage and total numbers of CD4+ T cells in the brain were decreased. IL-10 (F and I) and TNF (G and H) expression in virus-specific (IFN-+) CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were determined by IFN- ICS after stimulation with S510 peptide. data indicate mean SEM and represent combined data from 3 to 5 independent experiments. ating gene 1 (Rag1\u2013/\u2013), which lack B and T cells, died slightly more rapidly after infection than did mice given control feed containing PLX5622 prior to MHV infection. results show that microglia play nonredundant and unique roles in host survival during infection with a neurotropic virus infection. microglia potentially serve as sentinel cells able to detect invasive pathogens. infiltrating macrophages were phenotypically more immature, as evidenced by decreased MHC class II antigen and increased Ly6C expression. these cells, which might be expected to provide partial compensation for the absence of microglia, were phenotypically less potent antigen-presenting cells. PLX5622 has profound effects on microglia survival, but also on other brain-resident myeloid cells. macrophage maturation and probably function were compromised in the absence of microglia. this altered function is unlikely to be the primary cause of increased virus titers in the brain. we measured the potential effects of PLX5622 on macrophages. HC II in the brain probably contributed to the diminished virus-specific CD4+ T cell response observed in the absence of microglia. a diminished Treg response might contribute to increased effector CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses. the MHV-specific CD4+ T cell response has both protective and pathogenic roles. cell response in viral clearance was further demonstrated using MHV-infected Rag1\u2013/\u2013 mice. microglia depletion resulted in a small increase in time to death in these mice. however, these differences were minimal compared with the effects of drug treatment in immunocompetent mice. viral encephalitis tends to be a disease with sporadic incidence. sporadic incidence occurs in only a small percentage of infected patients. microglia dysfunction contributes to clinical encephalitis in the minority of patients who develop this disease after infection. 3 104 PFU rJ or N1347A, an rJ macrodomain point mutant virus (41), was inoculated into mice intranasally. brain tissue was homogenized into PBS using a manual homogenizer and frozen. after thawing, cellular debris was removed by centrifugation.
