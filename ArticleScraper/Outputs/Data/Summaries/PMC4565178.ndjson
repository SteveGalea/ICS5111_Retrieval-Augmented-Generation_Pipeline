{"summary": "the current outbreak of suspected or confirmed Ebola has been declared a public health emergency of international concern. we conducted a qualitative study with an emergent design at a tertiary hospital in Ontario, Canada. participants included physicians, nurses, respiratory therapists, and staff from infection control, housekeeping, waste management, administration, facilities, and occupational health and safety. tertiary level care and admitted about 110\u2013140 patients each month. the centre had recently been designated as an Ebola patient care site. but considerations in caring for these patients had not been made with the original construction of the unit. a highly infectious disease unit or area had not been established.

Discrepancies were resolved through group discussion. all potential cases of Ebola will be screened with the up-to-date tool. critical care hospital team members will be informed of the screening test result before any physical contact occurs. all patients admitted to the ICU who are from a high-risk area will receive appropriate ongoing screening. all hospital team members who help manage a patient with suspected or proven Ebola complete monitoring, even if there was no unprotected exposure. the most suitable rooms to manage the treatment of patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola will be selected and then redesigned and equipped if required. a clear and simple process to assemble the team required to transport the patient will be readily available at all times. hospital team members will not perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation in end-stage Ebola. team members will consider dialysis in the appropriate setting. hospital team members will be proficient in the management of sudden terminal events. there will be a clear process on how to screen visitors to the ICU and manage the treatment of any visitor who tests positive for Ebola. there will be a clear process on how to manage the treatment of anyone who has had unprotected contact with a patient with suspected or confirmed Ebola. personal protective equipment (PPE) will protect team members caring for patients with suspected or proven Ebola. the initial training included a fluid-resistant gown, 1 pair of gloves (2 if drawing blood), surgical mask, goggles and a face shield. experts from the Ottawa Hospital Infection Prevention and Control Program sourced equipment and rapidly developed a curriculum on PPE donning and doffing with the new equipment. the department recommended the use of a powered air purifying respirator (PAPR) suit when performing aerosol-generating procedures. a new room was identified that met the selection criteria. the room was redesigned and re-equipped to minimize the risk of transmission. the room was also redesigned and re-equipped to minimize the risk of transmission. the first PPE training for caring for patients with suspected or proven Ebola included a fluid-resistant gown, 1 pair of gloves (2 if drawing blood), surgical mask, goggles and a face shield. participants identified errors in the videos that were provided to enhance training, and the quality of the face-to-face training was also questioned. the infection control professionals appeared more open and engaged in listening to their comments and suggestions. they suggested that certification should reflect proficiency and not only participation in the training session. the initial PPE training for caring for patients with suspected or proven Ebola included a fluid-resistant gown, 1 pair of gloves (2 if drawing blood), surgical mask, goggles and a face shield. managements made to use dedicated footwear, a decontamination mat to clean footwear before exiting the anteroom, and an apron to be removed in the patient room before entering the anteroom. the apron was noted to be particularly important for use when caring for critically ill patients. iterative data were gathered from hospital team members to identify criteria for selection of an Ebola room. included considering the safest route of entry in the ICU, sufficient space outside the anteroom for equipment, isolation from other traffic including visitors and staff, ability to use adjacent rooms in the event of more than 1 patient. these criteria were then applied in the selection of a new Ebola room. the room was redesigned and re-equipped to minimize the risk of transmission while optimizing patient care. the room was redesigned and re-equipped to minimize the risk of transmission while optimizing patient care. the room was also redesigned and re-painted. the emergency department was identified as the most important source of patient transfers to the ICU. it was decided to first develop the transport process from the emergency department to the ICU. a transport process was iteratively developed through many walk-throughs with key stakeholders. a thorough literature review is the starting point of any standards-setting process. a single point of reference enhances communication and knowledge transfer to key individuals and throughout the organization. a collaborative, open and transparent focus with substantial opportunities for revision and improvement are inherent part of a high-quality standards-setting process. front-line hospital team members felt they were either misinformed or poorly informed regarding the preparedness planning. they described feeling that no information was being provided, and some participants believed that lack of information might have added to the anxiety of hospital team members. the results of our investigation show the need to contextualize practices to the local environment. this is well aligned with the CDC standard-setting consultations processes. many guidelines and resources exist to guide us in caring for these patients. we have been approached by individuals at other ICUs in canada. they have begun to use this matrix as the starting point for their local needs-assessment process. the results of this study are likely similar and transferable across ICUs. systematic approach to identifying gaps is an essential step in health delivery research aimed at ensuring safe practices are in place to care for patients with Ebola. systematic approach to identifying gaps is an essential step in health delivery research aimed at ensuring that safe practices are in place to care for patients with Ebola. extensive international travel across countries and a variety of highly infectious agents spread through direct contact. it is important to think beyond Ebola to be prepared for future possibilities."}
