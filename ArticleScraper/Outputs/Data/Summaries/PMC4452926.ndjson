{"summary": "negative staining electron microscopy (ns-EM) and immune-electron microscopy (IEM) have allowed the detection and identification of different viral particles in samples from several animal species. ns-EM excels in speed and \u201copen view\u201d, the ability to detect the \u201cunexpected\u201d without the need for specific reagents. convalescent sera collected from a case-patients 4\u20136 weeks after the onset of illness are powerful diagnostic reagents. if no agent has been identified by standard detection procedures, these serum samples may be used to improve the sensitivity of the EM method. convalescent sera are examined using direct ns-EM to ensure they are free from viral particles, and lipid and protein debris. grids are prepared using the airfuge method (see section 2.2 for details) and defined as clean (blank) organs (spleen, liver, kidney, lung etc.) extracts are re-suspended in 1 mL sterile distilled water. the samples are first frozen, thawed twice, and centrifuged at 5500 g for 20 min and at 12,800 g for 10 min for clarification. the second supernatant (85 L) is mixed with the same amount of each serial dilution of the convalescent sera. negative control sera were used at fixed dilutions of 1:5 and 1:50. both negative control sera were used at fixed dilutions of 1:5 and 1:50. both negative control sera were used at fixed dilutions. determination of the Optimal Dilution of Sera To achieve good results using the IAEM method, it is essential that virions and antibodies are at equal concentrations. the dilution is optimal when the immunoaggregates are of adequate size, the halo of antibodies around the virions is not too thick and the virion\u2019s morphology is not altered. dilutions in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) are tested, then appropriate intermediate dilutions (1:10, 1:50, 1:100, 1:500, etc.) are used. the observer determines the best combination of aggregate size, antibody halo and virion morphological integrity. the airfuge is fitted with an A-100/18 rotor holding six 175 L test tubes containing specific hand-made adapters with 3 mm grids. the adapters are almost identical to those provided in the past by Beckman. they are made of Plexiglas and shaped to fit perfectly into the tubes. results and discussion Some field cases of diagnosing animal diseases are representative of the results obtained by IAEM using convalescent sera to detect \u201cnew\u201d and emerging viruses, but also mixed viral infections and non-cultivable viruses. in subsequent paragraphs we describe the detection of viruses in clinical outbreaks pertaining to different species. a variety of laboratory techniques are available to establish a firm diagnosis of Group-A PoRVs. ns-EM methods, fluorescent antibody techniques, immunohistochemistry, ELISA tests and PCR are also used for group-specific typing. the detection of non-A, atypical RVs can be difficult due to the usually lower intestinal load. IAEM preparation with convalescent sera diluted 1:80. Negative staining (2% sodium phosphotungstate). TEM FEI Tecnai G2 Spirit, 85 kV. Bar = 200 nm; (C) a large group of rotavirus particles. in northern Italy, from 2002 to 2007, 1374 (38.3%) out of 3589 IAEM examinations tested positive for one or more viruses. circovirus (12%) and PED coronavirus (18.7%) represented the most common viral agents. calicivirus (0.5%), adenovirus (0.1%), parvovirus (0.1%), torovirus (0.1%) and small round fecal viruses/enterovirus-like viruses (4.4%) were not fully classified due to their undefined morphology. small 18\u201320 nm virions resembling circovirus () are grouped together with (A) a few partially destroyed and empty rotavirus particles () and (B) a large group of enterovirus-like particles (). small size (18\u201320 nm) of circovirus makes them difficult to recognize. the percentages are calculated based on the total number of cases with multiple infections (n = 45). the percentages are calculated based on the total number of cases with multiple infections (n = 45). convalescent serum 233/90 has since been systematically used in suspected cases. six more cases of PToV were identified using IAEM. one sample from 2002 was defined as a new strain of PToV. two kidney-shaped torovirus particles are visible in the middle together with several isolated fringed particles. pre-selection by IAEM or pre-screening by diagnostic RT-PCR of ToV-positive fecal specimens could allow detailed studies of the genetic diversity among ToVs. micrographs of ultracentrifuged fecal contents from pigs with diarrhea from two distinct outbreaks (A,B) the particles are visible as aggregates. small groups of coronavirus particles with well\u2013conserved surface spikes are visible. 28 strains were genetically analyzed, and 28 strains were further genetically analyzed. the practical approach for controlling PED is mainly based on active surveillance and on quick diagnoses using ELISA and PCR of fecal materials. a pool of sera, taken three weeks after a clinical episode of enteritis caused by RVs and AstVs, was obtained from convalescent turkeys. viral particles were observed in 51.4% of the examined samples and rotavirus (26.6%) and astrovirus (25.8%) mostly clumped in medium-large aggregates were the most frequently detected particles.

IAEM is no longer used as a routine diagnostic method for the detection of RHDV and EBHSV in clinical samples. the results obtained using IAEM with convalescent sera are valid proof of its importance and utility for discovering new animal viruses. porcine rotaviruses (PoRVs) are the major etiological agents of viral enteric diseases in the young individuals of several mammalian and avian species. antibody techniques, immunohistochemistry, ELISA tests and PCR are also used for group-specific typing. the detection of non-A, atypical RVs can be difficult due to the usually lower intestinal load, the lack of specific reagents for immune-enzymatic tests and the fact that characteristic single\u2014and double\u2014shelled particles may not be readily apparent during ns-EM observation.

IAEM negative control: small groups of coronavirus particles with well-conserved surface spikes are visible. sporadic outbreaks occurred between cyclic epidemic peaks. from 1994 to 2000, 296 samples tested positive using IAEM. Porcine rotaviruses (PoRVs) are the major etiological agents of viral enteric diseases in the young individuals of several mammalian and avian species. they are classified into eight Groups (A\u2013H) based on the nucleotide sequence identities of the VP6 gene, of which four (A\u2013C and E) affect swine. IAEM with convalescent sera more easily detects other viral agents, present in association with RVs. small round fecal virus/enterovirus-like particles are the most frequently present.

IAEM observation or the parallel detection of viral antigens/genomes in a multiplex format should be the most appropriate approach to obtain the correct laboratory diagnoses. the use of IAEM with anti-PCV2 convalescent sera is useful for more readily identifying multiple viral infections in which PCV2 is associated with other viruses. forty-five samples tested positive for PCV2 and it was frequently observed in association with one or more other viruses. the results confirm the lower sensitivity of IAEM compared with PCR. a higher level of PCV2 particles were detected in the caecum in comparison with the small intestine. in several occasions only the caecum contained circovirus particles. the convalescent serum 233/90 has since been systematically used in suspected cases. six more cases of PToV were identified using IAEM. one sample from 2002 was defined as a new PToV strain. RT-PCR of toV-positive fecal specimens could allow detailed studies of genetic diversity among ToVs. PEDV is a coronavirus that can infect and cause enteritis having typical clinical symptoms, including vomiting, diarrhea and dehydration, in pigs. sporadic outbreaks occurred between cyclic epidemic peaks. from 1994 to 2000, 296 out of 2072 samples tested positive using IAEM. diagnostic methods were set up as screening tools to evaluate presence and circulation of PEDV in field surveys. in turkey, RVs are often associated with astrovirus (AstV) [31] and cause, with a synergistic effect, clinical enteritis ranging from subclinical to severe. EM methods are still useful to quickly achieve a diagnosis of viral enteritis. astVs were identified when the 28\u201330 nm picornavirus-like icosahedral particles displayed the characteristic 5\u20136 pointed star-shaped surface. however, since the typical star-shaped configuration is usually visible in only approximately 10%\u201320% of the particles [34] we classified particles of this size-class as AstV if they showed a somehow structured surface. 1 2.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 1999 48 23 47.9 11 22.9 13 27.1 2 4.2 0 0.0 2 4.2 0 0.0 2 4.2 0 0.0 4 8.3 2000 41 19 46.3 14 34.1 10 24.4 0 0.0 4 9.8 1 2.4 2 4.9 1 2.4 2001 64 26 40.6 22 34.4 14 21.9 12 18.8 2 3.1 0 0.0 0 0.0 0 0.0 2002 77 46 59. immuno-aggregation electron microscopy (IAEM) preparation with convalescent sera diluted 1:40.

V causes a highly contagious and usually fatal disease of wild and domestic rabbits. the gross lesions include hyperemia, congestion and diffuse hemorrhages, liver degeneration, necrosis and splenomegaly. similarities to the existing EBHS described in brown hares (Lepus europaeus) became apparent. electron micrograph of ultracentrifuged trachea and lung extract from rabbits infected with an organ homogenate of Rabbit Hemorrhagic Disease. a few rare calicivirus particles are in the dirty and rich material, and thus, are hardly visible. smaller and thinner halos were seen using the heterologous rabbit sera. larger and thicker halos were seen using the heterologous rabbit sera. results obtained using IAEM with convalescent sera are valid proof of its importance and utility. IAEM with convalescent sera was used for identification of lagoviruses, pig torovirus and pheasant parvovirus. it was used for an easier diagnosis of non-cultivable viruses, such as non-A rotavirus, turkey astrovirus and PED coronavirus. the addition of specific controls to the IAEM reaction permits the validation and assessment of the immunoaggregation. the unique conditions that can limit the results obtained by IAEM are related to the subjectivity of the EM examination, which is highly dependent on the observer. antigen assays may fail to detect agents that differ in antigenic make up."}
