{"summary": "entry of enveloped viruses requires host cell binding and membrane fusion. some viruses utilize a single molecule as a receptor for entry into the host cell. many viruses require co-receptors localized near the receptor for complete entry. a recombinant virus system with a heterologous viral envelope gene has also been developed. we describe the properties of pseudotype or recombinant VSVs and their application to some enveloped viruses. the genome of the virus codes for five major proteins, glycoprotein (G), matrix protein (M), nucleoprotein (N), large protein (L), and phosphoprotein (P) the G protein mediates both viral binding and host cell fusion with the endosomal membrane following endocytosis. previous studies demonstrated that VSV forms a \u201cpseudotype\u201d when a cell is co-infected with VSV. up to the present, numerous types of pseudotype viruses have been constructed with heterologous viral envelope proteins. this is used in studies examining the entry of viruses, for identification of novel viral receptors, for development of neutralization tests, and as vaccine vectors. a recombinant virus system, which encodes a heterologous viral envelope gene instead of an envelope gene in its own genome, has also been made available by establishment of reverse genetics. the pseudotype virus released from the producer cells infected target cells but was not able to produce infectious progeny viruses. the recombinant VSV was able to undergo a fully productive infection generating infectious progeny viruses that could be passed into nave cells. the supernatants were replaced with 10% FBS DMEM. they were applied to 293T or BHK cells that had been transfected with pCAGVSVG 24 h previously. recovery of the virus was assessed by examining the cells for the cytopathic effects. cells were infected with the *G-complemented VSVG\u2013Env at an MOI of 5 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C and then extensively washed four times or more with serum-free DMEM. the infectious titers of the viruses were determined by evaluation of each reporter assay or a focus-forming assay. pseudotype virus systems based on VSV and retrovirus or lentivirus have been developed to study each step of HCV infection. the final determination of a true entry receptor or co-receptor capable of internalizing HCV may be made using an infection assay. the infection of Huh7 cells with pseudotype and recombinant viruses was inhibited by anti-hCD81 and anti-E2 antibodies and by sera from chronic HCV patients. these viruses, as well as pseudotype retroviruses (HCVpp) or HCVcc, were sensitive to the inhibitors of vacuolar acidification, such as ammonium chloride, concanamycin A, or bafilomycin A1. the genome consists of a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 11 kb, encoding a single large polyprotein. the envelope protein (E) is a 53-kDa glycoprotein, which is cleaved into three structural (C, PrM, and E) and non-structural (NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5) proteins. both JEVpv and JEVrv were neutralized by anti-JEV E antibodies. treatment of cells with inhibitors for vacuolar ATPase and clathrin-mediated endocytosis reduced the infectivity of JEVpv. treatment of cells with sphingomyelinase (SMase) significantly enhanced infection. efficient gene transduction into mammalian cells with lower cytotoxicity. pseudotype viruses based on retroviruses or lentiviruses bearing baculovirus envelope protein GP64 have recently been shown to exhibit efficient gene transduction into mouse organs. baculovirus GP64 is a step in the development of novel viral vectors for improved gene therapy. pseudotype viruses bearing each GPC envelope protein of various arenaviruses were generated as surrogate models for the study of viral infection or neutralization. the infection of pseudotype viruses was not completely inhibited by soluble protein or antibodies of receptor molecules. this suggests that another receptor molecule(s) might be involved in the entry of these viruses. these viruses are thought to mimic the functional properties of wild type arenaviruses."}
