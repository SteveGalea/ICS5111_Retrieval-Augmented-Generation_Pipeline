{"summary": "in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials, IFN therapy has been shown to reduce relapse rate and brain lesion development in patients with relapsing forms of MS. a subcutaneous (sc) formulation of IFN-1a (Rebif\u00ae Merck Serono S.A., Geneva, Switzerland) administered three times weekly (tiw) and an intramuscular (im) formulation of IFN-1a (Avonex\u00ae; Biogen Idec/ treatment with IFN in patients with relapsing MS has been associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) the presence of high titers of NAbs to IFN can reduce therapeutic effects of treatment. IFN-1a sc NF, 44 g (Rebif, serum-free formulation, lot number Y09B7770V, Industria Farmaceutica Serono, Rome, Italy); and IFN-1b sc, 250 g (Betaferon, lot number 1560, Bayer Schering, Berlin, Germany). assessment of antiviral activity was assessed using the A549/vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) c infection was allowed to progress for 24 hr according to time required for specific cytopathic effects to become clearly visible by optical microscopy. titration of VSV was carried out in L929 mouse fibroblast cells. the specific activities used were 32 MIU/mg for IFN-1b sc and 270 MIU/mg for IFN-1a sc. these specific activity values were provided by the manufacturers. compared the antiviral activities of each IFN formulation to the world health organization reference standard of recombinant human IFN. the following primer pair and probe \u2013 MxA (MxA F: 5\u2019-CTGCCTGGCAGAAAACTTACC-3\u2019; MxAP: 6-carboxifluorescein (FAM)-5\u2019CATCACACATATCTGTAAATCTCTCTGTTAGA3\u2019-6carboxy-tetramethylrhodamin (TAMRA)[28]) were added to the universal PCR master mix. the fold-change in IFN-induced expression of ISGs was estimated using the formula, 2(Ct), where Ct = [Ct ISG (+IFN) \u2013 Ct GUS (+IFN)] \u2013 [Ct ISG (\u2013IFN) \u2013 Ct GUS (\u2013IFN)]. IFN Formulations Antiviral activity and induction of ISG expression were evaluated for three formulations of IFN. IFN-1a sc, 44 g (Rebif, original formulation, lot number Y09B7770V, Industria Farmaceutica Serono, Rome, Italy); IFN-1a sc NF, 44 g (Rebif, serum-free formulation, lot number Y09B0227, Industria Farmaceutica Seron 12 wells were filled with 0.1 mL of medium to serve as virus and cell control. both IFN-treated and control viruses were inoculated with VSV. titration of VSV was carried out in mouse fibroblast cells. the antiviral activity of IFN was calculated from a dose-response curve. the specific activities used were 32 MIU/mg for IFN-1b sc. the specific activities used were 270 MIU/mg for IFN-1a sc. RNA was dissolved in 50 L of RNase-free water, and quantitation of ISG mRNA was performed by a real time 5\u2019 exonuclease RT-PCR Taqman assay using an ABI 7000 sequence detector. the following primer pair and probe \u2013 MxA (MxA F: 5\u2019-CTGCCTGGCAGAAAACTTACC-3\u2019; MxAP F: 5\u2019TCTGTTATTCTCTCTCTGTTAGA3\u2019 the threshold cycle (Ct) value is the PCR cycle in which the amplification plot crosses the threshold line. the amplification plot crosses the threshold line. the difference (Ct values) between the ISGs and the housekeeping gene GUS was estimated using the formula, 2(Ct) concentrations of each IFN formulation, MxA gene expression activity were measured in three replicates. a logarithmic scale was used to present the results so that they could be displayed meaningfully on the same graph. we also measured VSV yield reductions in A549 cells treated with 10 and 100 times the IC50 of each IFN formulation. at both 10 and 100 times the IC50, VSV yield reductions did not significantly differ between IFN-1a sc and either IFN-1a sc formulation. 0.05 for both comparisons using Student's t-test. VSV yield reductions in A549 cells treated with 10 and 100 times the IC50 of IFN preparations VSV yield reduction. c IC50 values measured in A549 cells infected with VSV are expressed as ng/mL (0.098 0.028 ng/mL for IFN-1b sc, 0.030 0.0077 ng/mL for IFN-1a sc, and 0.032 0.0082 ng/mL for IFN-1a sc NF) NF induced higher mRNA levels of MxA, ADAR1 and ISG56 compared with IFN-1b sc. no significant difference in ISG expression between IFN-1a sc and IFN-1a sc NF. IFN-1a sc (0.030 0.0077 ng/mL); IFN-1a NF sc (0.032 0.0082 ng/mL); and IFN-1b sc (0.098 0.028 ng/mL) formulations were compared on a weight basis. no significant difference between IFN-1a sc and IFN-1a sc NF. concentrations corresponding to 10 times the IC50 of each IFN formulation were compared on a weight basis (ng/mL) the VSV yield reductions did not significantly differ between IFN-1b sc and either IFN-1a sc formulation. c IC50 values measured in A549 cells infected with VSV are expressed as ng/mL (0.098 0.028 ng/mL for IFN-1b sc, 0.30 0.0077 ng/mL for IFN-1a sc, and 0.32 0.0082 ng/mL for IFN-1a sc NF) ISG expression differences were consistent with those observed for antiviral activity of the IFN formulations. at 10 IU/mL and 100 IU/mL, there were no significant differences between mean fold-changes in ISG mRNA expression for IFN-1a sc, IFN-1a sc NF and IFN-1b sc. at 0.5 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, IFN-1a sc and IFN-1a sc NF induced significantly higher mRNA levels of (B) MxA, (D) ADAR1 and (F) ISG56 compared with IFN-1a sc (270 MIU/mg) significantly more IFN-1b sc was required to equal the antiviral activity of either formulation of IFN-1a sc in terms of IC50. however, when concentrations corresponding to 10 times the IC50 of each IFN formulation were compared on a weight basis, VSV yield reductions were similar with each of the three IFN formulations. -1a for sc and IFN-1b showed that IFN-1a has an antiviral activity approximately 14 times greater than that of IFN-1b (0.236 ng/mL versus 3.333 ng/mL, respectively) similar differences in biologic activity between IFN-1a and IFN-1b formulations have been reported previously. the relevance of these in vitro findings to the clinical effects of the IFN formulations in relapsing MS is unknown. however, examination of in vitro biologic responses demonstrates distinct properties of these compounds."}
