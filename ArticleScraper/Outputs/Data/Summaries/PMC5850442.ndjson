{"summary": "the accuracy of procalcitonin to discriminate between viral and bacterial pathogens requires further dissection. a procalcitonin threshold of 0.1 ng/mL resulted in 80.9% sensitivity. no procalcitonin threshold perfectly discriminated between viral and bacterial pathogens. but higher procalcitonin strongly correlated with increased probability of bacterial pathogens. adult EPIC study population has been previously described. study personnel performing PCT measurements were blinded to clinical information. pathogen testing included blood culture; sputum culture (limited to high-quality specimens) urinary antigen test for Streptococcus pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila. adenovirus, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus were tested. only patients who underwent at least 1 bacterial test and at least 1 viral test described above were considered to have adequate pathogen testing and included in the final study population. analysis PCT Among Pathogen groups based on test results. patients with typical bacterial detection also categorized patients according to the type of test positive for bacteria. we then compared serum PCT concentration in patients positive for typical bacteria across these 3 different categories of positive tests. we compared patients with any bacterial pathogen, including both typical and atypical bacteria, with patients who had a viral pathogen detected. positive and negative predictive values were calculated using PCT cut-points of 0.1 ng/mL, 0.25 ng/mL, and 0.5 ng/mL [15, 28, 29]. we modeled PCT values with a restricted cubic spline function with 4 knots located at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles. the lower limit of PCT detection was 0.05 ng/mL. study personnel performing PCT measurements were blinded to clinical information. pathogen testing Each enrolled patient underwent systematic pathogen testing per study protocol [7] NP/OP swabs with CDC-developed methods for adenovirus, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and respiratory syncytial virus. only patients who underwent at least 1 bacterial test and at least 1 viral test described above were considered to have adequate pathogen testing. 0.1\u20130.24 ng/mL; 0.25\u20130.49 ng/mL; 0.5 ng/mL. the prevalence of each pathogen group within these PCT strata was calculated. we compared patients according to the type of test positive for bacteria. PCT values were highly skewed; thus, we modeled PCT values with a restricted cubic spline function with 4 knots located at the 5th, 35th, 65th, and 95th percentiles [32]. Statistical analyses were performed with Stata software version 12 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas) patients in the viral group to those in the atypical and typical bacterial groups with the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. the prevalence of each pathogen group within these PCT strata was calculated. we then compared serum PCT concentration in patients positive for typical bacteria across these 3 different categories of positive tests. this was an analysis of PCT accuracy for bacterial CAP assuming no patients with unknown etiology had undiagnosed bacterial disease. for each of these dichotomous analyses, we constructed a nonparametric receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of PCT to discriminate between bacterial CAP and the comparator group. no pathogen was detected in 1075 (62%) patients. 409 (24%) were classified into the viral group. most common pathogen in the viral, atypical bacterial, and typical bacterial groups were rhinovirus (n = 114), M. pneumoniae (n = 36), and S. pneumoniae (n = 93), respectively. Typical bacteria were more prevalent in the higher PCT strata among patients both in the ICU and general medical floor. the center of each box plot represents the median, with the box denoting the interquartile range (IQR), the whiskers representing 1.5 times the IQR, and dots showing outliers beyond the whiskers. with typical bacteria detected by blood culture (6.7 ng/mL; IQR, 0.9\u201325.8 ng/mL) than by respiratory sample (0.8 ng/mL; IQR, 0.2\u20135.4 ng/mL; P.01) or urinary antigen test (0.7 ng/mL; IQR, 0.06\u20133.4 ng/mL; P.01) Accuracy of PCT for identifying Bacterial CAP Any Bact Selected PCT cut-points (0.1 ng/mL, 0.25 ng/mL, 0.5 ng/mL, 1.0 ng/mL) are displayed. abbreviations: AUC, area under the curve; CI, confidence interval. the x-axes were truncated at a PCT of 15 ng/mL due to the small number of patients with concentrations above this level. a PCT threshold of 0.1 ng/mL identified typical bacterial pathogens with a sensitivity of 87.6% (9.6%) in patients with an undetectable PCT, the probability of a typical bacterial pathogen detection was 0.14 (95% CI,.11\u2013.17), while in patients with a PCT of 10 ng/mL, the probability of a typical bacterial pathogen increased to 0.77 (95% CI,.66\u2013.85) Interestingly, PCT was higher with Legionella detection (median, 1.1 ng/mL) than other atypical bacteria, including Mycoplasma (media no pathogen was detected in 1075 (62%) patients. 409 (24%) were classified into the viral group. most common pathogen in the viral, atypical bacterial, and typical bacterial groups were rhinovirus (n = 114), M. pneumoniae (n = 36), and S. pneumoniae (n = 93) Typical bacteria were more prevalent in the higher PCT strata among patients both in the ICU and general medical floor. the center of each box plot represents the median, with the box denoting the interquartile range (IQR), the whiskers representing 1.5 times the IQR. median PCT was also higher in patients with typical bacteria detected by blood culture (6.7 ng/mL; IQR, 0.9\u201325.8 ng/mL) than by respiratory sample (0.8 ng/mL; IQR, 0.2\u20135.4 ng/mL; P.01) or urinary antigen test (0.7 ng/mL; IQR, 0.06\u20133.4 ng/mL; P.01) Selected PCT cut-points (0.1 ng/mL, 0.25 ng/mL, 0.25 ng/mL, 0.25 ng/mL, 1.0 ng/mL) are displayed. diagnostic test Characteristics of Procalcitonin at Selected Cut-points Procalcitonin Cut-point Test Characteristic Discrimination of Bacterial From Viral and Atypical CAP. x-axes were truncated at a PCT of 15 ng/mL due to the small number of patients with concentrations above this level. the x-axes were truncated at a PCT of 15 ng/mL due to the small number of patients with concentrations above this level. the probability of a typical bacterial pathogen detection was 0.14 (95% CI,.11\u2013.17), while in patients with a PCT of 10 ng/mL, the probability of a typical bacterial pathogen increased to 0.77 (95% CI,.66\u2013.85) PCT was higher with Legionella detection (median, 1.1 ng/mL) than other atypical bacteria. PCT threshold 0.1 ng/mL was associated with 0.25 (95% CI,.22\u2013.29) probability of bacterial detection.
