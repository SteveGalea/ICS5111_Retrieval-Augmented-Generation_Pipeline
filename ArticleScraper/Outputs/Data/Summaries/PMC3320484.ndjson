{"summary": "the study We estimated the health-related impact of pandemic influenza on the Israeli population by using rates (illness, physician visits, hospitalizations, and deaths) derived from previous pandemics. we calculated direct costs to the healthcare system and overall costs to the economy. estimated 1,618,200 patients (25% of the Israeli population), 781,921 physician visits, 10,334 hospitalizations, 2,855 deaths, and 6,536,240 lost workdays. these outcomes would result in an excess of $55.4 million in health-related costs and overall costs to the economy of $523.5 million. we adjusted all cost-benefit outcomes for a conservatively estimated probability of 3 pandemics every 100 years. we applied a wide range of estimates for sensitivity analyses. sensitivity analyses used the variable ranges detailed in Table 1 proved to be robust. strat-specific vaccine, most effective tool for influenza control, will most likely not be available in the early stages of a pandemic. antiviral drugs are likely to be in short supply if not preemptively stockpiled. oseltamivir stockpiling is cost-saving to the economy over a wide range of treatment strategies. short-term prophylaxis of close contacts may require antiviral stockpiles. the risk of \"strategy failure\" due to early antiviral stockpile depletion must be considered. the probability of a pandemic has probably risen to >3 per 100 years. the economic consequences of a rapidly disseminating disease extend well beyond direct costs to the healthcare system. mitigating a pandemic could prevent extensive indirect economic losses. the conclusions of this study must be considered carefully during the planning of antiviral stockpiling. we divided the population (6,748,000 in Israel at the end of 2003) into 3 age categories: 18 years, 19\u201364 years, and 65 years (14). each age category was further grouped by low- or high-risk for serious complications of influenza infection by using the US population age-specific proportions (15). the value of lives lost made up 83% of all estimated costs of pandemic influenza. the addition of the value of lives lost increases our calculated cost-benefit ratios >6-fold. drug resistance may appear in approximately one third of patients treated with the M2 inhibitors amantadine or rimantadine (17,18) we based our calculations on a 10-year shelf life for the drug, when stored as bulk active powder, and discounting was performed by using the locally accepted annual rate of 3%. the cost-benefit ratio of each strategy was calculated by dividing strategy-specific drug costs by treatment-derived economic benefits. prophylactic strategies can be divided into long-term preexposure prophylaxis and short-term, epidemiologically directed postexposure prophylaxis. strategy 1: Therapeutic antiviral use When given therapeutically to influenza patients within 48 hours of symptom onset and if continued for 5 days, neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the duration of clinical symptoms by an average of 1 day (26), hospitalization rates by 59% (27), and antimicrobial drug use by 63% (2 we assumed a pandemic duration of 50 days (30) and calculated drug costs accordingly. a computerized search was conducted using MEDLINE and Embase databases. this search was limited to articles published in English. authors who reviewed the papers also abstracted information from each of the selected studies. all data were abstracted by using a standardized protocol and computerized report form. only 2 studies of preexposure prophylaxis were included, but no sensitivity analysis was applied. the overall protective efficacy of this intervention was 71% (95% CI 57%\u201380%) this result was used as the point estimate for the protective efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors. longini et al. have shown that these estimates are sensitive to various parameters of the population and the pandemic strain, such as population compliance, delay in treatment initiation, and the outbreak basic reproductive number (29,36) this postexposure prophylaxis strategy is less likely to lead to such early depletion of antiviral stocks when used in the first stages of the pandemic. sensitivity analyses applied a wide range of values for the parameters relating to pandemic probability, health-related pandemic outcomes, and antiviral drug efficacy. the analysis examined the effect that the modification of each parameter had on the main outcomes (cost-benefit ratios) the most important parameters were the severity of the pandemic (illness and death rates) and the annual probability of a pandemic. current events in Southeast Asia suggest that the probability of a pandemic may now be 2\u20133 times greater than our upper limit (1 every 10 years) cost-benefit ratios can be adjusted by multiplying current high-end estimates by the same factor. health-related effects of an H5N1 pandemic may be similar or worse than those seen in 1918. point estimates and ranges of health-related variables used in the base-case model are detailed in Table A1. we constructed a baseline nonintervention scenario by using age- and risk-specific rates to estimate the expected numbers of patients, physician visits, hospitalizations, deaths, and lost work days. these outcomes were then recalculated for each intervention strategy, as described in detail below, yielding the economic benefit associated with each strategy. neuraminidase inhibitor oseltamivir has been shown to be effective against H5N1 and H9N2 viruses in mice (20) only zanamivir is licensed for prophylaxis in Israel (21), the united kingdom (22), and the united states (23). zanamivir has several other major disadvantages, including higher rates of adverse effects. nonintervention The baseline scenario provides an estimate of health-related and economic outcomes that would be expected if the pandemic allowed to run its natural course. these estimates were selected to be in line with our general approach to underestimate the pandemic's effect and potential benefits provided by each of the interventions. we evaluated 2 variations of preexposure antiviral use. nonselective treatment available to all patients (strategy 1A) and selective treatment limited to use in patients at high risk (strategy 1B). we adjusted this model for treatment initiation rates. randomized, controlled, double-blind trials met all of these criteria. randomized, controlled, double-blind trials were based on intent-to-treat analysis. the authors who reviewed the papers also abstracted information from each of the selected studies. eltamivir and zanamivir are both neuraminidase inhibitors. the results of the individual studies were comparable. the protective efficacy of the interventions was calculated as 1 \u2013 RR. only 1 study (29) published to date used dynamic mathematical modeling to examine the expected effectiveness of this pandemic control measure on a population level during an influenza pandemic. the authors of that study modeled communities of 2000 people, with predefined mixing patterns between subpopulations and a relatively limited number of \"outsiders\" entering the population. clinical influenza would develop in a varying proportion of participants who received prophylaxis despite treatment (breakthrough cases) we assumed that these patients would nonetheless benefit from the neuraminidase inhibitors that they had been receiving, and they were credited with the effects of therapeutic neuraminidase inhibitor treatment. only the strategy of treating patients at high risk represented a cost savings, with a cost-benefit ratio of 1.23. when a combination of low-range estimates were assumed, the cost-benefit ratios of therapeutic treatment and postexposure prophylaxis were decreased. but these strategies remained cost-saving, with cost-benefit ratios of >2.27 and 1.47. we divided the population (6,748,000 in Israel at the end of 2003) into 3 age categories: 18 years, 19\u201364 years, and 65 years (14). each age category was further grouped by low- or high-risk for serious complications of influenza infection by using the US population age-specific proportions (15). the value of lives lost made up 83% of all estimated costs of pandemic influenza. we calculated both direct costs to the healthcare system and overall costs to the economy. the addition of the value of lives lost increases our calculated cost-benefit ratios >6-fold. we based our calculations on a 10-year shelf life for the drug, when stored as bulk active powder, and discounting was performed by using the locally accepted annual rate of 3%. the cost-benefit ratio of each strategy was calculated by dividing strategy-specific drug costs by treatment-derived economic benefits. strategies We assumed that strain-specific vaccine would be unavailable during the initial months of a pandemic. neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the duration of clinical symptoms by an average of 1 day (26), hospitalization rates by 59% (27), and antimicrobial drug use by 63% (26). we assumed a pandemic duration of 50 days (30) and calculated drug costs accordingly. we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies evaluating the protective efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors. the authors who reviewed the papers also abstracted information from each of the selected studies. all data were abstracted by using a standardized protocol and computerized report form. cases were defined as clinical influenza confirmed by isolation of influenza virus. only 2 studies of preexposure prophylaxis were included, no sensitivity analysis was applied. the overall protective efficacy of this intervention was 71% (95% CI 57%\u201380%) this result was used as the point estimate for the protective efficacy of neuraminidase inhibitors. neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the duration of clinical symptoms by an average of 1 day. neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the duration of clinical symptoms by an average of 1 day. neuraminidase inhibitors can reduce the duration of clinical symptoms by an average of 1 day (26), hospitalization rates by 59%. effects of treatment on reducing death rate have not yet been studied or quantified. effects on death rate reduction would not alter our cost-benefit calculations. effects on death rate reduction would not alter our cost-benefit calculations. randomized, controlled, double-blind trials met all criteria. randomized, controlled trials included a study sample whose participants were 18\u201369 years of age; a healthy, community-based population without specific baseline disease; and a report on intent-to-treat analysis. for each study, we calculated the RR and 95% confidence interval (CI) for influenza infection in the intervention group compared to the control group. oseltamivir and zanamivir are both neuraminidase inhibitors. only 1 study (29) published to date used dynamic mathematical modeling to examine the expected effectiveness of this pandemic control measure on a population level during an influenza pandemic. the authors of that study modeled communities of 2000 people, with predefined mixing patterns between subpopulations and a relatively limited number of \"outsiders\" entering the population. this postexposure prophylaxis strategy is less likely to lead to such early depletion of antiviral stocks when used in the first stages of the pandemic. in these first stages, longer prophylactic courses may be considered. as scale of outbreak increases, application of this strategy becomes more problematic. the most important parameters were severity of the pandemic (illness and death rates) and the annual probability of a pandemic. only the strategy of treating patients at high risk represented a cost savings, with a cost-benefit ratio of 1.23. if the annual probability of a pandemic remains >1 every 80 years, stockpiling antiviral drugs to treat patients at high risk remains consistently cost-saving. attack rates, the rates of physician visits and hospitalizations are double our upper value. the cost-benefit ratios of therapeutic treatment of all patients and postexposure prophylaxis would be 6.55 and 3.12."}
