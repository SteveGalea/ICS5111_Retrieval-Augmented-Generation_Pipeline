{"summary": "influenza viruses of subtypes H3N2 and H1N1 have been circulating in the human population since 1968 and 1977. in 1997, the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 virus emerged in china, subsequently spread across Europe and into Africa in 2004\u20132005. this pandemic has been associated uncommonly with severe viral pneumonia and excess mortality in children and young to middleaged adults 2. aims of the workshop were to describe the mechanisms of lung injury in acute influenza; to identify potential immunotherapeutic targets to mitigate influenzamediated acute lung injury. presentations covered observations on the pathology and clinical disease during severe influenza and the cellular and molecular biology of infection in humans. seroepidemiology and investigation into hospitalised cases have allowed good estimates of pandemic H1N1 2009 infection attack rates and disease severity. overall population attack rate was found to be 10.7%, but infection and mortality rates were highly age dependent. a significant proportion of patients with severe pandemic H1N1 illness had secondary bacterial infection at presentation (26\u201355% of fatal cases). Enhanced viral replication, tropism for cells in the lung and dysregulated inflammatory response are thought to contribute to lung pathology in H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 viral pneumonia. ferrets infected with H5N1 showed a reduction in weight loss and viral load. final mortality rates were the same for both treated and untreated ferrets. correlations exist between increased viral load and increased cytokine levels. the cytokines produced by the epithelial cells and macrophages represent only the start of the immune response, and their paracrine action further amplifies and broadens the host response. as infection progresses, leucocytes are recruited to the infection site, thus enabling adaptive immunity to develop. the extent of pneumonia seen in hospitalised patients with pandemic H1N1 2009 illness correlates with elevated serum cytokine levels. the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus causes more severe disease than seasonal H1N1 but generally less than H5N1 influenza infection. global gene expression profiling in infected human type I pneumocytes reenforces the similarity of the pandemic and seasonal H1N1 viruses. these differences are subtle, so host factors such as comorbidities, genetic susceptibility and preexisting immunity would appear to be the main factors that drive disease. the majority of fatal cases manifesting DAD had acute DAD (64% of cases) associated with a shorter time in hospital before death (mean, 3.4 days), compared to those with organising DAD (28% of cases; mean, 11.7 days) or fibrosing DAD (8% of cases; mean, 31.5 days), whereas fatal cases hospitalised for more than 10 days showed organising DAD. 55% of fatal pandemic H1N1 cases were positive for secondary bacterial infection, lower than reported in 1918 and 1957 pandemics. other pandemics have found lower rates of secondary bacterial infection in fatal cases with a range of 26\u201338%. the exact mechanism by which these comorbidities contribute to severe disease remains to be understood. adiponectin, an adipokine that reduces macrophage activity and proinflammatory cytokine production, is produced in decreased amounts in patients with obesity. this decrease has been postulated to contribute to increased risk of severe influenza. seroepidemiology and investigation into hospitalised cases have allowed good estimates of pandemic H1N1 2009 infection attack rates and disease severity. overall population attack rate was found to be 10.7%, but infection and mortality rates were highly age dependent. 66fold increase in fatality rates in those 5060 years of age compared with children. a significant proportion of patients with severe pandemic H1N1 illness had secondary bacterial infection at presentation. Enhanced viral replication, tropism for cells in the lung and dysregulated inflammatory response are all thought to contribute to lung pathology in H5N1 and pandemic H1N1 viral pneumonia. correlations exist between increased viral load and increased cytokine levels, 8 so that continued viral replication is a contributing factor to disease. primary human macrophages infected with H5N1 differentially express proinflammatory cytokines. ucocytes are recruited to the infection site, thus enabling adaptive immunity to develop. the virus can infect and egress from endothelial cells from either the apical or basolateral aspect, this provides a mechanism by which these viruses may spread systemically. the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus causes more severe disease than seasonal H1N1 but generally less than H5N1 influenza infection. the pandemic H1N1 2009 virus is also found at higher titres and more widely distributed in the lower respiratory tract tissue. patients with severe disease show slow viral clearance and prolonged hypercytokinaemia. current antiviral therapy may not be sufficient, and more potent antiviral regimens may be important for improving outcomes in severe pandemic H1N1 2009 and H5N1 infections. a recent macaque model of pandemic H1N1 infection has shown virusassociated damage of both type I and type II pneumocytes 37 that reinforce the reported findings of involvement of these in fatal human cases. the pathology results from inflammatory mediators released during infection of other areas of the respiratory tract. 35 Bacteria most commonly identified were Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus with one case of MRSA. other pandemics have found lower rates of secondary bacterial infection in fatal cases with a range of 26\u201338%. 11, 38 However, antibiotics might have been administered to most of these patients with H1N1 2009 illness, thereby confounding bacterial detection upon autopsy. cytokine production is produced in decreased amounts in patients with obesity. this decrease has been postulated to contribute to increased risk of severe influenza. NLRP3 is a member of the recently discovered nucleotidebinding domain. NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the innate response to a wide variety of bacterial, fungal and viral stimuli, including the influenza virus. NLRP3/ mice also fail to mount detectable serum IL18, serum or pulmonary IL1 or pulmonary MIP2 responses. the NLRP3 inflammasome response to influenza infection involves lysosomal cathepsin B and ROS that are typical of DAMP detection pathways. however, ROS also contribute to lung damage and inhibitors like Nacetyl cysteine have been used in individual cases of severe pandemic H1N1 influenza. VLA1 and VLA2 are matrixbinding integrins expressed by resident lung CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. the development of tissue memory CD8+ cells was found to be impaired after influenza infection. 46 Fewer lung CD4+ T cells express less VLA1 than lung CD8+ T cells. IL22 is a homeostatic cytokine produced by NK and CD4+ T cells. a deficiency in IL22 can leave animals susceptible to lethal lung and gut infections. IL22 levels in the lung decreased after day 2 of a primary infection. 177 host genes fell into 11 functional groups, including kinase regulated signalling, ubiquitin pathway, phosphatase activity and transcription factors. a dense interaction network containing 181 of the confirmed host proteins and influenza virus proteins was formed. this work did not detect any elevation in early viral replication. studies used the same epithelial cell line and virus strain in their experiments. the other studies use different viruses (i.e. A/PR8 or VSVG enveloped virus) and different cell lines. the expression of innate immunity genes in alveolar epithelial cells and macrophages during influenza infection in vitro has been previously established. 56 Type II pneumocytes predominantly express the 23linked sialic acid receptor which make them preferentially permissible to avian viral subtype infections. the reason for this difference is unclear as both viruses exhibited similar replication levels in this system. infected macrophages did produce TNF and IFN but lower levels of IL29. Lung surfactants can suppress and enhance inflammatory signals. the addition of an IL1R antagonist or soluble TNFR was able to block CXC chemokine secretion from the rat coronavirus (sialodacryoadenitis virus) infected alveolar epithelial cells, IL1 is partly responsible for CXC chemokine production. these observations demonstrate that alveolar type II pneumocytes are able to respond robustly to nonavian influenza virus strains and other mice were inoculated with an inactivated H5N1 virus. viral antigen was observed in lung pneumocytes and more commonly in alveolar macrophages. severity of lung injury was correlated with increased production of various proinflammatory cytokines. lipid, OxPAPC, has been found in the membranes of apoptotic macrophages. it mediates an inflammatory effect through TLR4 or MyD88. 67, 68 Antiinflammatory properties of OxPAPC have also been reported in LPSinduced sepsis and ALI. a signalling pathway through TRIFTRAF6 enables NFB activation of proinflammatory cytokine responses, particularly IL6, that contribute to ALI. some underlying risk factors for severe disease in influenza are also associated with increased oxidative stress and raised ROS levels. the cellular receptor for SARS is the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 71, 72. NLRP3 is a member of the recently discovered nucleotidebinding domain and leucinerichrepeatcontaining protein 3 (NLRP3) there are 20 NLR proteins discovered to date, but few have been characterised in depth. the NLRP3 inflammasome is involved in the innate response to a wide variety of bacterial, fungal and viral stimuli, including the influenza virus. NLRP3/ mice also fail to mount detectable serum IL18, serum or pulmonary IL1 or pulmonary MIP2 responses. mice exposed to synthetic RNA analogues, both dsRNA and ssRNA, subsequently mediated NLRP3 inflammasome IL1 production. mice exposed to synthetic RNA analogues, both dsRNA and ssRNA, subsequently mediated the inflammasome response. VLA1 and VLA2 are matrixbinding integrins expressed by resident lung CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. the development of tissue memory CD8+ T cells was found to be impaired after influenza infection. 46 Fewer lung CD4+ T cells express less VLA1 than lung CD8+ T cells. cytokine produced by NK and CD4+ T cells stimulates epithelial proliferation. a deficiency in IL22 can leave animals susceptible to lethal lung and gut infections. NK cell production of IL22 is IL23 dependent. 177 host genes fell into 11 functional groups, including kinase regulated signalling, ubiquitin pathway, phosphatase activity and transcription factors. a dense interaction network containing 181 confirmed host proteins and influenza virus proteins was formed. of the 295 host factors identified to affect viral replication, 219 were confirmed to be necessary for wildtype virus growth. the other studies use different viruses (i.e. A/PR8 or VSVG enveloped virus) and different cell lines (e.g. HBEC, Drosophila cell line) the source of the RNAi libraries may also be a contributing factor. type II pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages express sialic acid receptor. both viruses were able to infect each cell type. but only the pneumocytes were able to support virus replication. infected macrophages elicited similar innate responses to those seen in type II pneumocyte cells. in a resting lung, surfactants can help downregulate inflammation via NFB. in a damaged lung, surfactants allow the activation of NFB. FR was able to block CXC chemokine secretion from the rat coronavirus (sialodacryoadenitis virus)infected alveolar epithelial cells. addition of an IL1R antagonist or soluble TNFR reduced IL8 secretion by approximately 50%. these observations demonstrate that alveolar type II pneumocytes are able to respond robustly to nonavian influenza virus strains. mice were inoculated with an inactivated H5N1 virus. viral antigen was observed in lung pneumocytes and more commonly in alveolar macrophages. severity of lung injury was correlated with increased production of various proinflammatory cytokines. 67, 68 Antiinflammatory properties of OxPAPC have been reported in apoptotic macrophages in atherosclerosis 66. the H5N1 caused the production of ROS that converts PLs to OxPLs. oxidised PLs were also found in the lungs of both inactivated and live H5N1 virusinoculated mice. the cellular receptor for ARDS is the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 71, 72 which is a component of the reninangiotensin system. ACE2 knockout mice were protected from a productive SARS virus infection. ACE2 knockout mice were shown to have severely impaired lung function. 76 Activating molecules on alveolar macrophages include PRRs, CD40 and OX40L. the balance of both activation and dampening pathways is site specific. kinetics of a respiratory infection can be described in three stages: homeostasis, inflammation and resolution. inflammation can be triggered by direct damage to the epithelium by infecting virus. epithelial damage also leads to the loss of \u2018dampening\u2019 ligands that are found on the epithelial cells that express them. 77 During inflammation, epithelial cells are damaged leading to the loss of epithelial CD200, thereby contributing to the loss of dampening signals. an alternative therapeutic approach would therefore be to treat with exogenous CD200. the severity of the initial infection is related to an increase in CD200R after resolution, such that influenza causes more CD200R expression than RSV infections. mice infected with influenza followed by a Streptococcus bacteria up to 2 weeks postinfluenza infection show an increase in bacterial load in the lung. inoculum, greater increases in a subset of lung DCs that were Ly6chi and CD11bhi (called tipDCs) occurred in mice lethally infected with an A/H5N1 virus as compared to those infected with a nonlethal H5N1 strain. 81 Similarly, tipDCs were recruited to the lungs during influenza infection by the chemokine CCR2. the peroxisome proliferator\u2013activated receptor (PPAR) agonist pioglitazone has multiple pharmacologic actions including reducing MCP1 (monocyte chemotactic protein1 or CCL2), TNF and iNOS levels. protection was found to be correlated with reduced MCP1 and MCP3 production. cytokine and cytokine receptor knockout mice tested if specific cytokines were involved in causing severe disease. the absence of IL6, MIP1, IL1 receptor (IL1R) or IL1R had no effect on mouse morbidity, mortality or virus titres after challenge with the highly pathogenic virus. IL1R knockout mice showed increased morbidity and mortality. this did not appear to be related to virus spread. TNFR1/ mice exhibited reduced disease progression. single IL1R and TNFR1 mutant mice challenged with highly pathogenic H5N1 virus. reduced morbidity seen in triple mutant mice was not associated with any difference in lung viral titres. 84, 86, 87 Immunomodulator treatment in mice infected with influenza. cox1/ or wildtype mice showed a higher lung viral load at day 4p.i. 90 Prostaglandins have been found to affect cytokine production during an inflammatory response. celecoxib (a cox2 inhibitor) was tested in mouse models of H5N1 virus infection with and without the antiviral zanamivir given intraperitoneally. 92, 93, 94 Influenza is associated with worse outcomes in people with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, diabetes, renal disease, obesity, asthma and late pregnancy. statins are 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA) inhibitors that act to reduce cholesterol and are commonly prescribed for cardiovascular indications. 105 in the 26% of patients receiving inpatient statin treatment, a 66% relative reduction in hospital mortality was reported. other potential immunomodulatory agents that should be considered for treating severe influenza include PPAR agonists (fibrates) and PPAR agonists (glitazones) 76 Activating molecules on alveolar macrophages include PRRs, CD40 and OX40L. the balance of both activation and dampening pathways is site specific. kinetics of a respiratory infection can be described in three stages: homeostasis, inflammation and resolution. epithelial damage also leads to the loss of \u2018dampening\u2019 ligands that are found on epithelial cells that express them, e.g. CD200. 77 During inflammation, epithelial cells are damaged leading to the loss of epithelial CD. mice treated with exogenous CD200 showed reduced morbidity and lung inflammation. a CD200R agonistic monoclonal antibody showed similar beneficial effects. 78 These data indicate CD200R agonists as promising novel therapeutics. 'innate imprinting' can account for observations of increased susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections following influenza. mice infected with influenza followed by a Streptococcus bacteria up to 2 weeks postinfluenza infection show an increase in bacterial load in the lung. tipDCs were recruited to the lungs during influenza infection by the chemokine CCR2. in mice with ablated tipDC recruitment, no reduction in morbidity or protection from lethal challenge was observed. a partial reduction in tipDC recruitment was undertaken to lessen inflammation. tazone pretreatment of mice given a/PR8 virus reduced morbidity and mortality significantly without affecting viral replication. protection was found to be correlated with reduced MCP1 and MCP3 production and fewer tipDCs in the lungs after infection. cytokine knockout mice tested whether specific cytokines were involved in causing severe disease. results showed that the absence of IL6, MIP1, IL1 receptor (IL1R) or IL1R had no effect on mouse morbidity, mortality or virus titres after challenge with the highly pathogenic virus. TNFR1/ mice exhibited decreased disease progression. mortality rates were ultimately not affected and mice succumbed to infection by day eleven postchallenge. the reduced morbidity seen in triple mutant mice was not associated with any difference in lung viral titres. antiviral drug that suboptimally reduces viral titres might not produce a concurrent reduction in cytokines associated with increased lung inflammation and morbidity. virus was eventually cleared to levels seen in wildtype mice by day 6p.i. 90 Prostaglandins have been found to affect cytokine production during an inflammatory response. celecoxib (a cox2 inhibitor) was tested in mouse models of H5N1 virus infection with and without the antiviral zanamivir given intraperitoneally. 92, 93, 94 Influenza is associated with worse outcomes in people with cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, diabetes, renal disease, obesity, asthma and late pregnancy. statins are 3hydroxy3methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGCoA) inhibitors that act to reduce cholesterol. 105 in the 26% of patients receiving inpatient statin treatment, a 66% relative reduction in hospital mortality was reported. other potential immunomodulatory agents that should be considered for treating severe influenza include PPAR agonists (fibrates) and PPAR agonists (glitazones) an aerosolised bacterial lysate can completely protect mice from a lethal challenge with Streptococcus pneumoniae if administered 24 hours before challenge. 109 Lysate administered 24 hours before challenge with an H3N2 influenza virus increased mouse survival from 0% to 90%, reduced weight loss and decreased lung viral titres. FNs, IL6 and TNF 109 In influenza challenge studies, protection was also associated with a significant rise in bronchial lavage IL6 and TNF levels after lysate administration. lavage cytokine levels are much lower compared to infected mice that were not given prior lysate treatment. the role of the mucosal protein CC10 (Clara cell 10kDa protein) in respiratory infections. 111, 112 CC10 appears to have multiple functions. it acts on Clara cells to facilitate cell trafficking and protein transport. a recombinant CC10 (rhCC10) has completed phase I/II clinical trials in preterm infants with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) one randomised, doubleblind, placebocontrolled trial of 22 neonates found that a single intratracheal administration of 0, 1.5 or 5 mg/kg rhCC10 was safe and efficacious with a significantly decrease pulmonary inflammation indices. 117 polyICLC has been found to induce protection against a range of respiratory and mucosal pathogens in animal models. rhCC10 also produced less pulmonary TNF, IL1 and IL6 than rats given LPS alone. 118 PolyICLC could still be induced when LE polyICLC was administered up to 3 weeks before challenge, whereas polyICLC could be given up to 7 days before challenge. 118 polyICLC was also shown to be protective in a cotton rat model of influenza. no observational studies or clinical data have been reported to date. lysate administration also prevented mortality after challenge with a range of other bacterial or fungal pathogens. 108 Lysatetreated mice exhibit enhanced bacterial killing that is correlated with an increase in antimicrobial peptides in the BAL (e.g. lysozyme and surfactant apoprotein D), 108. only a synergistic combination of TLR ligands was able to recapitulate the protective effect of the crude bacterial lysate. a combination of TLR2 and TLR9 ligands (ODN 2395, 10101 and M362) induced protection to both bacterial and influenza virus challenge. CC10 deficiency leads to severe inflammation and airway dysfunction. it is associated with diseases such as pneumonia, ARDS, COPD, asthma and pulmonary fibrosis. none of the 11 treated infants needed hospitalisation owing to a respiratory infection. 113 in vitro RSV infections of the epitheliallike HEp2 cell line also showed that the addition of rhCC10 significantly reduced viral titres. rhCC10 suppresses airway constriction and inflammation in isolated rat lungs perfused with bacterial endotoxin. cytidylic acid (polyIC) stabilised with lLysine and carboxymethylcellulose and a liposomeencapsulated polyICLC called LE PolyICLC. the polyIC molecules activate TLR3 on epithelial cells and myeloid cells initiating innate immune signalling and cytokine production. 117 polyICLC has been found to induce protection against a range of respiratory and mucosal pathogens in animal models. ally delivered polyICLC and LE polyICLC may offer potentially effective prophylaxis or early treatment for influenza and other respiratory viruses. drugs currently in development include superoxide dismutase mimetics, OX40 antibody constructs and antiTNF therapies. the number of novel drugs that have entered clinical trials is much lower than expected. only one (activated Protein C) has been approved to date. there is very limited data on the use of protein C for the treatment of ALI. novel therapies for influenza are identified amongst drugs already licensed for the treatment of other diseases. drugs identified and pursued in this way are of little interest to large pharmaceutical companies. passive immunotherapy via convalescent blood products is proposed for treating cases of severe influenza. a growing number of publications examining the impact of various immunomodulators in experimental systems, mainly in the mouse. research is needed to further test a broader array of novel therapeutics, extend observations to other relevant animal models and to understand modes of action. studies of selected immunomodulators in uncomplicated influenza are now possible. clinical testing of candidate agents needs to rigorously assess clinical, virologic and immune measures. this is because of the safety issues raised by modulating immune responses. passive immunotherapy via convalescent blood products or immunoglobulin (Ig) has been proposed for treating cases of severe influenza. 124, 125 Convalescent blood products appeared to be beneficial during the 1918 pandemic. it will be important to determine and take into account the differential host responses that are activated by different virus strains, e.g., H5N1 versus seasonal influenza. an alternative option would also be to target the host cellular interactome of the virus. genesis in humans, understanding the limitations of these models, integrating findings from different models and identifying markers or surrogates that might predict benefit. the extension of findings in such models to other species is a key point for further study. clinical testing of candidate agents needs to rigorously assess clinical, virologic and immune measures.
