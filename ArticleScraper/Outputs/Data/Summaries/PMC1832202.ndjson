{"summary": "results InfluSim is a deterministic compartment model based on a system of over 1,000 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model by clinical and demographic parameters relevant for pandemic preparedness planning. it allows for producing time courses and cumulative numbers of influenza cases, outpatient visits, applied antiviral treatment doses, hospitalizations, deaths and work days lost due to sickness. a pandemic pandemic preparedness planning tool is designed to meet the requirements in preparedness planning. it is based on an explicit formulated dynamic system which allows addressing time-dependent factors. it is sufficiently flexible to evaluate the impact of most candidate interventions and to consider local conditions like demographic and economic factors. model is based on a system of 1,081 differential equations which extend the classic SEIR model. Demographic parameters reflect the situation in Germany in 2005, but can be adjusted to other countries. 224.25 50.75 37.52 14.96 20\u201339 34.50 34.86 50.75 75.66 49.45 25.08 40\u201359 15.83 20.61 37.52 49.45 61.26 32.99 60 + 11.47 11.50 14.96 25.08 32.99 54.23 The who-acquires-infection-from-whom matrix K a s shows the frequency of contacts (per week per person) between different age classes. a fraction of asymptomatic cases see a doctor: [11]; 50% of symptomatic cases see a doctor: [9]; hospitalizations per severe case: [9]; case fatality of hospitalized, but untreated patients calculated from [4]. the total population is divided in age classes, each of which is subdivided into individuals of low and high risk. a fraction of clinically ill cases need to be hospitalized, and an age-dependent fraction of hospitalized cases may die from the disease. the degree and duration of contagiousness of a patient depend on the course of the disease; the latter furthermore depends on the age of the patient. the last two stages of the incubation period are used as early infectious period during which the patient can already spread the disease. the peak of the pandemic wave is reached after six to seven weeks, with a daily incidence of up to 2,340 influenza patients seeking medical help. the pandemic wave proceeds relative slowly if the contagiousness does not change during the infectious period (x50 = 50%), but proceeds quickly if the contagiousness is highest after onset of symptoms. values of x50 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95% are concentrated during the first half of the contagious period. x50 = 95% means that 95% of the cumulative contagiousness is concentrated during the first half of the contagious period, see Table 6. a geographically limited spread and fairly effective control measures can imply that the epidemic affects only a small population. transmission which predominantly occurs in households or hospitals is not in agreement with the assumption of homogeneous mixing in the deterministic model cannot reliably predict the spread of infection. infected individuals are infected at a rate a(t) which depends on their age a and on time t. the last l incubation stages are regarded as early infectious period. the course of disease depends on the age a of the infected individual. a fraction ca, r(A) becomes asymptomatic (Aa), a fraction ca, r (M) becomes moderately sick (Ma), a fraction ca, r (V) becomes very sick (Xa) and the remaining fraction ca, r (X) becomes extremely sick (Xa) and need hospitalization. the rationale for distinguishing very sick and extremely sick cases is that only extremely sick cases can die from the disease and need to be hospitalized. antiviral treatment reduces patients' contagiousness by fI percent. extremely sick and hospitalized cases die at rates a, depending on their age.
