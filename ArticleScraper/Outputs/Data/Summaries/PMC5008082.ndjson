{"summary": "the expression of several IFITM genes (e.g., those encoding IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 in mice and IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 in humans (1, 2). the expression of several IFITM genes (e.g., those encoding IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 in mice and IFITM1, 2, 3, 5, and 10 in humans (1, 2). IFITM1, IFITM2 and IFITM3 appear to restrict fusion and uncoating of viruses into the cytoplasm (33, 38, 39) different IFITM proteins inhibit specific viruses in distinct membrane compartments. the precise mechanism of restriction of viral fusion has remained elusive. CD8+ resident memory T cells expressed high levels of Ifitm3 in the lung following IAV infection. Ifitm3 also reportedly has an antiviral role against respiratory syncytial virus in vivo. the study was carried out in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health. the protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Washington University School of Medicine. spleen, kidney, draining lymph node, brain, spinal cord were harvested, weighed, homogenized by bead dissociation using a MagNA Lyzer (Roche) the virus titer was determined by plaque assay on Vero cells (58, 59), or levels of viral RNA were measured by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) as described previously (49, 60). cells were analyzed on a BD LSRII flow cytometer. data were processed using FlowJo software. splenocytes were isolated and stimulated with anti-CD3. lentivirus was collected from the supernatant of cells, centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were spinoculated at 1,000 g for 30 min at 24\u00b0C. lentivirus was removed and replaced with DMEM containing 10%. transduced cells were sorted for green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. pFCIV encodes GFP under an internal ribosome entry site promoter. cells were passaged five times to confirm stable expression of GFP. a 1:1,000 dilution of mouse anti--actin (11714-1-AP; Proteintech) and rabbit anti-Ifitm3 (3700; Cell Signaling) was prepared in TBST with 4% milk. after washing, a 1:10,000 dilution of donkey anti-mouse IRDye 800 (925-32212; LI-COR) or anti-rabbit IRdye 680 (926-68073; LI-COR) was 5.1 (B6.SJL) and CD45.2 (Ifitm3/) mice were transferred adoptively by intravenous injection into 8-week-old recipient B6.SJL and Ifitm3/ mice that had been irradiated with 900 cG. Tissues were harvested 7 days after infection for viral burden and cellular immune response analysis. ifitm3/ mice were generated previously (57), backcrossed using speed congenics onto a C57BL/6J background. eight- to 10-week-old age- and sex-matched mice were used. infected mice were monitored for 21 days for viral-burden studies. anti-CD3-V500 (560711; BD Bioscience), anti-CD8- or anti-CD8-peridinin chlorophyll protein (PerCP) Cy5.5 (100734; Biolegend), anti-CD19-Alexa Fluor 700 (115528; Biolegend), anti-CD4-BV421 (100437; Biolegend), anti-granzyme B (GRB04; Invitrogen), and tetramers specific for a Db- anti-CD8-PerCP-Cy5.5 (126609; Biolegend), anti-CD19-Alexa Fluor 700 (115528; Biolegend), anti-IFN-APC (51-73-1182; eBioscience), and anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha-phycoerythrin (anti-TNF--PE; 506306l; Biolegend) antibodies were analyzed. lentivirus was collected from the supernatant of cells, centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C to remove cellular debris. transformed MEFs were seeded at 0.5 104 cells per well in a 96-well plate. cells were spinoculated at 1,000 g for 30 min at 24\u00b0C. cellular debris was removed from the sample by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the clarified supernatant was resuspended in 4 LDS sample buffer (NP0008; NuPAGE), boiled (5 min at 90\u00b0C), then electrophoresed on a 12% bis-Tris gel (NP0343BOX; NuPAGE) cells were harvested, fixed, and permeabilized using the Foxp3/transcription factor staining buffer set. cells were incubated with rabbit anti-c-Myc antibody or humanized E16 (68), a WNV E protein-specific monoclonal antibody. RESULTS Ifitm3 restricts WNV infection and pathogenesis in mice. Ifitm3 is an ISG that has been reported to restrict infection of several flaviviruses in cell culture. we inoculated 8- to 9-week-old WT and congenic Ifitm3/ C57BL/6 mice via a subcutaneous route with 102 FFU of a pathogenic strain of WNV. WNV levels in serum (B), draining lymph node (C), spleen (D), brain (E) and spinal cord (F) were measured by qRT-PCR (B and C) or plaque assay (D to F) solid lines represent the median viral titers. two or three mice were used per independent experiment,and 5 to 7 independent experiments were performed. higher viral titers were observed in the brains of Ifitm3/ mice. higher viral titers were observed in the brain and spinal cord of Ifitm3/ mice. this could reflect enhanced replication in peripheral organs and viremia. the increased CNS titers in Ifitm3/ mice were not due to direct antiviral effects in neuronal cells. eight- to 10-week-old age-matched WT and Ifitm3/ mice were inoculated via an intracranial route. spleens were harvested on day 7 (A to H) or 8 (I to N) after infection. percentage and number of bulk CD4+ and CD8+ T cells and NS4B tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells were determined. flow cytometry plots of NS4B-specific CD3+ CD8+ T cells (M) and CD3+ CD8+ that express TNF- and IFN- after peptide restimulation (N) are shown. a small decrease in the number of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the periphery of Ifitm3/ mice. Ifitm3/ mice have normal levels of immune cells in the brain after WNV infection. CNS immune responses were examined after subcutaneous inoculation of of 102 FFU of WNV. en analyzed sera from WT and Ifitm3/ mice on day 7 after infection. anti-WNV IgG response was greater in Ifitm3/ mice at day 8 after infection. no difference in inhibitory activity was detected in sera from WT and Ifitm3/ mice at day 8 postinfection. 5 mice were used per independent experiment, and 4 independent experiments were performed. Statistical significance was determined by the Mann-Whitney test (*, P 0.05) Ifitm3 controls WNV infection in some primary cells. derived M (A to C) and DCs (D to F) were infected at an MOI of 0.01 with WNV (New York 1999) in some experiments, cells were pretreated for 16 h with 0 0.1, 1 or 10 U/ml of IFN-. the results reflect at least three independent experiments. c-Myc-Ifitm3 expression was validated by Western blotting. untransduced and c-Myc-FLUC-transduced Ifitm3/ and Ifitm12356/ (locus deletion) MEFs sustained higher WNV infection. chimeric mice were infected at an older age, 16 weeks, than in other studies. chimeras with Ifitm3/ or WT radioresistant nonhematopoietic cells (WTIfitm3/ or Ifitm3/WT) had equivalent levels of virus in serum, draining lymph node, and spinal cord. Ifitm3/ mice (Ifitm3/Ifitm3/WT) sustained higher titers in the brain. s is the phenotype of enhanced WNV infection in the CNS. Ifitm3 has functions in both the hematopoietic and nonhematopoietic cell compartments to restrict WNV infection in mice. WT and Ifitm3/ mice were more vulnerable to WNV infection than WT mice, as a greater percentage succumbed to disease than the latter. the mean time to death of Ifitm3/ was shorter than that of WT mice (10.6 versus 11.8 days, P 0.05) two or three mice were used per independent experiment. dotted lines represent the median viral titers. dotted lines denote the limit of detection of the assay. the high WNV titers in the brain and spinal cord of Ifitm3/ mice could reflect enhanced replication in peripheral organs and viremia. it could be due to intrinsic antiviral effects of Ifitm3 in cells of the CNS. eight- to 10-week-old age-matched WT and Ifitm3/ C57BL/6 mice were inoculated via an intracranial route with 101 FFU of WNV. Tissues were harvested at day 3 or day 5 after infection. the number of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells, and NS4B tetramer-specific CD8+ T cells was decreased in Ifitm3/ mice after WNV infection. splenocytes from naive mice were stimulated ex vivo with an immunodominant WNV NS4B peptide and tested for cytokine production. flow cytometry plots of NS4B-specific CD3+ CD8+ T cells (M) and CD3+ CD8+ that express TNF- and IFN- after peptide restimulation (N) were shown. a small decrease in the number of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells in the periphery of Ifitm3/ mice at day 8 after infection by flow cytometry. Ifitm3/ mice have normal levels of immune cell populations in the brain after WNV infection. the percentage and total number of CD11b+ CD45lo microglia (A and B), CD11b+ CD45hi macrophages (C and D), CD4+ T cells (E and F), CD8+ T cells (G and H), CD8+ granzyme B+ T cells (I and J) and NS4B-specific CD8+ T cells (K and L) Ifitm3/ mice have reduced B cell numbers but not reduced antiviral antibody titers. anti-WNV IgG response was greater in Ifitm3/ mice at day 8 after infection. we compared multistep growth kinetics and effects of IFN- treatment in different primary cells derived from WT and Ifitm3/ mice. we did not observe statistically increased viral yields in unstimulated Ifitm3/ M (Fig. 6A) pretreatment of IFITM3/ M with low doses of IFN- to stimulate ISG production did result in marginally higher levels of virus than in similarly treated WT M (Fig. 6B and C) cells were pretreated for 16 h with 0 0.1, 1 or 10 U/ml of IFN-. lentivirus-mediated expression of Ifitm3 was validated by Western blotting. flow cytometry was used to detect expression of c-Myc-tagged proteins. ectopic expression of c-Myc-Ifitm3 reduced WNV infection in WT, Ifitm3/ (13-fold, P 0.01), and Ifitm12356/ (locus deletion) MEFs sustained higher WNV infection. Ifitm3/ or WT radioresistant nonhematopoietic cells (WTIfitm3/ or Ifitm3/WT) had equivalent levels of virus in serum, draining lymph node, and spinal cord. Ifitm3/ mice (Ifitm3/Ifitm3/WT) sustained higher titers in the brain (Fig. 7E, P 0.05), as seen with the direct gene deletions. CD45.1+ B6.SJL and CD45.2+ Ifitm3/ mice were sublethally irradiated and reconstituted with either CD45.1+ B6.SJL or CD45.2+ Ifitm3/ bone marrow (107 cells) chimeric mice were inoculated via the subcutaneous route with 102 FFU of WNV (New York 1999) tissues were harvested at day 7 after infection. survival analysis revealed that Ifitm3/ mice were more vulnerable to lethal WNV infection. this enhanced susceptibility was associated with increased viral infection in both peripheral and CNS tissues. Ifitm3/ and Ifitm12356/ mice were equally susceptible to IAV. this was associated with increased viral titers in the lung, increased lung pathology, and lymphopenia. bone marrow chimera experiments suggest that Ifitm3 expression on both radioresistant and radiosensitive cells contributes to the control of WNV infection and pathogenesis in vivo. despite a highly intricate IFN-dependent signaling cascade, the deletion of single effector genes still can impact the control of viral infection and disease outcome. study has demonstrated that Ifitm3 has an important antiviral function in vivo against WNV."}
