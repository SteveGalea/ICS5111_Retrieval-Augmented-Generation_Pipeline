{"summary": "clinical progress in 18 H7N9-infected patients was monitored and recorded. the clinical features of H7N9 infection were noted. factors associated with treatment outcomes were analyzed by univariate analyses. IAVs are classified into subtypes based on combinations of 16 hemagglutinin (HA: H1 \u2013 H16) and 9 neuraminidase (NA: N1 \u2013 N9) surface antigens, and two pathotypes (low and high pathogenicity) based on lethality for chicken. no evidence of human-to-human H7N9 virus transmission has been found to date. human infections with highly pathogenic H7 viruses generally resulted in conjunctivitis or uncomplicated influenza [3], according to report by Chinese scientists. 126 patients have been diagnosed with H7N9 infection and 24 patients have died since the first confirmed case was reported in Taiwan. all 18 patients who participated in the study were admitted to Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center and diagnosed with H7N9 infection from April 6 to April 20, 2013. their medical records were obtained and analyzed. factors analyzed for possible correlation with clinical features and treatment outcomes in patients included baseline characteristics of patients, such as age, sex, occupation, conditions, exposure to poultry and/or wild birds in the past seven days. patients were given antibiotics based on blood and/or throat-swab specimens/sputum tests for bacterial infections. some patients also received glucocorticoid therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, and TCM therapy. logistic regression models were used to evaluate possible factors contributing to different outcomes in H7N9-infected patients. results were reported as odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) multivariate analysis was not considered suitable for such a small sample study. the influenza A H7N9 clinic program was published by the national health and family planning commission of P. R. China. the guidelines included basic supporting therapy, antibiotic therapy, antiviral therapy, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) and other therapies. Yinqiao powder and Hoisting Powder were prescribed for patients with mild syndromes. yinqiao powder and yinqiao powder were prescribed for patients with mild syndromes. there were 14 males and four females in the 18 H7N9-infected patients. average ages of patients in group A and group B were 67.010.83 and 72.7512.0 years. four patients, including three from group A and one from group B, had a history of smoking.

Laboratory tests of 18 H7N9-infected patients. the univariate analysis indicated that 1 mg/l increase in C-reactive protein (P = 0.032), 1 mol/l increase in total. the univariate analysis indicated that 1 mg/l increase in C-reactive protein (P = 0.32), 1 mol/l increase in total. bilirubin (P = 0.096), 1 mol/l increase in serum creatinine (P = 0.1), 1 mg/l increase in myoglobin (P = 0.041) and 1 cell/l increase in CD3+/CD4+/CD45+ T cells were likely associated with a critical outcome (P = 0.089, 0.093, and 0.08, respectively) four females in the 18 H7N9-infected patients were in group A and eight in group B. average ages of patients in group A and group B were 67.010.83 and 72.7512.0 years respectively. four patients, including three from group A and one from group B, had a history of smoking. characteristics N = 10 N = 8 P Gender, N (%) Male 8 (80) 6 (75) 1.0 Age, years (mean SD) 67.010.83 72.7512.0 0.302 Smoking history, N (%) 3 (30) 1 (12.5) 0.588 Underlying conditions, N (%) Hypertension 5 (30) 3 (37.5) 0.664 Diabetes 0 2 (25) 0.183 Coronary heart diseases 1 (10) 2 (25) 0.559 COPD 1 (10) 2 (25) 0.559 more than half of the 18 H7N9-infected patients suffered from fever (88.9%), cough (77.8%), expectoration (55.6%), fatigue (50.0%), poor appetite (83.3%), dry month (72.2%), thirst (72.2%), dyspnea (66.7%), chest distress (66.7%), and bitter taste in month (61.1%). group B laboratory tests of 18 H7N9-infected patients. group B laboratory tests N = 10 N = 8 P Blood routine White blood cell (109/L) 4.835(1.99\u20138.74) 6.035(5.38\u201327.42) 0.374 Red blood cell (1012/L) 4.390.54 3.780.83 0.117 Hemoglobin (g/L) 137.713.46 114.523.53 0.097 Platelet cell (109/ 0.464 Renal function Blood ureanitrogen (mmol/L) 6.8753.17 9.96.72 0.298 Serum creatinine (mol/L) 76.9110.69 126.0344.63 0.04 Myocardial enzymes, (U/L) Creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme 22.712.75 23.2516.15 0.203 Myoglobin (ng/ml) 89.656.49 215.053 ine (P = 0.1), 1 mg/l increase in myoglobin (P = 0.041), and 1 cell/l increase in CD3+/CD4+/CD45+ T cells were likely associated with a critical outcome (P = 0.089, 0.093, and 0.08, respectively) these results might be limited by the small sample size in our study. anti-influenza drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors were effective against seasonal influenza and H5N1 virus infections when given early in the course of the illness. however, these drugs had not yet been used to treat H7N9 infections. four patients, including three from group A and one from group B, had a smoking history of 30 to 40 years. nearly half of the patients (8/18) had hypertension, two had diabetes, three had coronary heart diseases, and three had COPD. avoiding contact with poultry and wild birds may effectively reduce the risk of infection. the delayed diagnosis and treatment for this highly pathogenic avian influenza virus infection might have partly contributed to the poor prognosis in H7N9-infected patients. early surveillance and early diagnosis should speed up diagnosis and treatment. most H7N9-infected patients had severe conditions with one or more complications. CD45KO mice and humans who lacked CD45 expression were severely immunodeficient and had very few peripheral T lymphocytes with impaired T and B cell responses. further studies on T cell-mediated responses during H7N9 infection might provide useful information to help develop effective therapies such as H7N9 vaccines. knowledge of risk factors, clinical features, and potential complications discussed in our paper would help clinicians who triage patients with suspected or confirmed H7N9 infection determine appropriate treatment strategies. increased research and surveillance are required to further understand the pathogenesis of H7N9 infection and epidemiological factors that contribute to severe conditions."}
