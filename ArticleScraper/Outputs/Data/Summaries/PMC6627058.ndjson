{"summary": "melanin is produced in skin epidermal cells to protect the skin from ultraviolet radiation. tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) belongs to the type 3 copper protein family. it catalyzes the hydroxylation of l-tyrosine to l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA), and subsequent oxidation of l-DOPA to DOPA quinone. phlorotannins, eckol, triphlorethol-A, phlorofucofuroeckol A, and dieckol, from the edible brown alga Ecklonia stolonifera, exhibit anti-tyrosinase activity at macromolar concentrations. ethyl acetate fraction of ethanol extract of E. cava suppressed catalytic reaction of tyrosinas phlorofucofuroeckol A (4) [12], 2-O-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-6,6\u2032-bieckol (5) [17], 6,8\u2032-bieckol (6) [18], and 8,8\u2032-bieckol (7) [8] were reported to have the inhibitory activity on mushroom tyrosinase. phlorotannins, 2-phloroeckol, 7-phloroeckol dieckol, and 2-O-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-6,6\u2032-bieckol, substituted with phloroglucinol in eckol increased the inhibitory effect on tyrosinase compared to other compounds. tyrosinase inhibitors can replace phenolic compounds. phlorotannins from seaweeds have been used to develop non-competitive tyrosinase inhibitors 7-phloroeckol, dieckol, and the. compounds 3 and 5 competitively inhibited the catalysis of tyrosinase. the substrate was added into a mixture of ligand (3.1 M) that was preincubated with tyrosinase. over time, their inhibition activity increased. compounds 3 and 5 (C,D) were held by six hydrogen bonds with three amino acids. the phloroglucinol moiety of compound 3 had a \u2013 bond interaction with His85 at 9.4 distance. ethyl acetate fraction of ethanol extract of E. cava was known to suppress catalytic reaction of tyrosinase. phlorotannins, eckol, triphlorethol-A, phlorofucofuroeckol A, and dieckol were isolated from this fraction. yl acetate layer (54.9 g) was subjected to open column chromatography. the compounds were identified as triphlorethol A (1) [16], eckol (2) [8], 2-phloroeckol (3) [16], phlorofucofuroeckol A (4) [12], 2-O-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-6,6\u2032-bieckol (5) [17], 6,8\u2032-bieckol tyrosinase inhibitory activity increased in a dose-dependent fashion. compounds 2\u20135 showed inhibitory activity, with IC50 values of 7.0 0.2 to 66.4 0.1 M. the structure of compound 5 contained the moiety of compound 3. 2-phloroeckol, 7-phloroeckol dieckol, and 2-O-(2,4,6-trihydroxyphenyl)-6,6\u2032-bieckol, substituted with phloroglucinol in eckol, increased the inhibitory effect on tyrosinase compared to other phlorotannins [4,5,6,7]. tyrosinase inhibitors can replace phenolic compounds tyrosinase inhibitors 7-phloroeckol, dieckol, and phlorofucofuroeckol have been used to develop the non-competitive tyrosinase inhibitors. compounds 3 and 5 competitively inhibited the catalysis of tyrosinase and might be useful for improving whitening. the two strongest inhibitors had different slow-binding mechanisms. inhibitor 5, which has a higher molecular weight, induced a conformational state of the enzyme. the binding pose (A) of two compounds 3 and 5 into tyrosinase (orange: 3, green: 5). hydrogen bonds (B,C), hydrophobic interactions (D,E) and 9.4 - interaction (F) of inhibitor with enzyme. silica gel (Merck 60A, 70\u2013230 or 230\u2013400 mesh ASTM) and reversed-phase silica gel (YMC Co., ODS-A 12 nm S-150, S-75 m) were used for open column chromatography.
