{"summary": "cidofovir may be a consideration for non-life-threatening adenovirus-related enteritis/colitis. pharmacokinetic limitations such as poor bioavailability lead to insufficient fidelity between prescribed dose and pharmacodynamics effects. both CD3 (547 cells/l) and CD4 (180 cells/l) cell counts were low. a metabolic profile indicated acute kidney injury, with a serum creatinine level of 1.9 mg/dl. hypokalemia (2.7 mmol/liter) and mild hypomagnesemia (1.6 mg/dl) a surveillance plasma adenovirus PCR was negative 2 weeks after the conclusion of treatment. nitazoxanide was used in an immunocompromised host."}
