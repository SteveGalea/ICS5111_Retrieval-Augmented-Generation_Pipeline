{"summary": "Background Overlapping genes are common in RNA viruses where they serve as a mechanism to optimize the coding potential of compact genomes. however, such genes can be difficult to detect using conventional gene-finding software. overlapping CDSs are very short and highly conserved. overlapping CDSs are subject to a reasonable degree of purifying selection. MLOGD can provide a robust detection with just two input sequences. candidates detected by MLOGD are typically those for which only a small number of relevant sequences were available. candidates were closely inspected for a potential translation mechanism in the context of current knowledge of the gene expression strategy of the virus in question. positive values indicate that ORFX is likely to be coding. candidates marked with an '*' are indicated with 'NA' ORF1a-ORF1b fusion are translated from the genomic RNA (gRNA) while the structural polyprotein (ORF2) is translated from a sub-genomic RNA (sgRNA) [8,9]. a 112-codon AUG-initiated +1 frame ORF is present in nearly all human astrovirus sequences in GenBank. the proposed new coding sequence, ORFX, overlapping ORF2 in the +1 reading frame. for clarity, regions with alignment gaps in the arbitrary reference sequence (viz. Z25771) have been removed. the +0 frame corresponds to ORF2 and is therefore devoid of stop codons. the ORFX AUG codon is 41 to 50 nt downstream and has an 'A' at -3 and a 'G' at +4 (strong Kozak context; conserved in 149 out of 152 human astrovirus sequences with coverage of both the ORF2 and ORFX AUG codons) in all cases, there are no intervening AUG codons in any frame. seadornavirus segment 7 The seadornaviruses (family Reoviridae) are dsRNA viruses with 12 genome segments, all of which have so far been presumed to be monocistronic. these viruses are transmitted by mosquitoes and the type species, Banna virus (BAV), has been associated with fever, flu-like symptoms and encephalitis. the close proximity of the ORFX AUG codon to the VP7 AUG codon may further enhance initiation at the latter, via the translation initiation coupling mechanism described in Ref. [24]. seadornavirus segment 7 VP7 CDS and ORFX. colour coding is as follows: blue - VP7 initiation codon; green - potential ORFX initiation codon; yellow (olive) - flanking nucleotides matching the optimal (suboptimal) Kozak context. currently two other species with sequence coverage of the ORFX region. cytorhabdoviruses comprise a genus within the family Rhabdoviridae. the genomes of LNYV and LYMoV contain at least six CDSs. the genomes of LNYV and LYMoV contain at least six CDSs. the mean nucleotide identity between the two sequences within the ORFX region is only 50%. the presence of this ORF has already been noted in both viruses [27,28] (and designated P' by Ref. [28]). coronavirus genomes are among the largest of all RNA viruses. they have a monopartite positive-sense ssRNA genome encoding a large replicase polyprotein that is expressed from the genomic RNA (ORF1a and via ribosomal frameshifting), and a number of other proteins. coded structural proteins (S, E, M, N) are conserved throughout all groups. a variable number of auxilliary proteins are also encoded by sgRNAs. we have identified two new candidates - one in Group 3 coronaviruses of the proposed subgroup 3c [36] and one in certain Group 1b coronaviruses. negative scores indicate that ORFX is likely to be a coding sequence, but is subject to significantly weaker purifying selection than NS6. there are no intervening AUG codons in any frame between the NS6 AUG codon and the ORFX AUG codon. ORFX appears to be present in bat coronavirus 1B (BtCoV 1B), bat coronavirus 1A (BtCoV 1A) and bat coronavirus HKU8 (BtCoV HKU8) [39]. ORFX appears amenable to translation via leaky scanning from the same sgRNA as ORF3 since the ORF3 AUG initiation codon has a 'G' at -3 and a 'U' at ORFX has length 91-95 codons. MLOGD analysis also confirmed probable coding status of ORF3. ORF3 subject to significantly stronger functional constraints than ORFX. ORFX overlaps the 5' end of ORF2 in the +1 reading frame. an 112-codon AUG-initiated +1 frame ORF is present in nearly all human astrovirus sequences in GenBank. this region of enhanced conservation is not present in the avian astroviruses. there is also little evidence for ORFX in other mammalian astroviruses. the ORFX AUG codon generally has a 'G' at -3 and a 'G' at +4. it also appears to be positioned very close to the 5' end of an mRNA. the ORFX AUG codon is 41 to 50 nt downstream and has an 'A' at -3 and a 'U' at +4. the infectivity of a mutant astrovirus in which ORFX expression was inadvertently abolished was reduced by only 50% relative to wild-type virus. this does not imply that the putative ORFX product is not a CDS. there is greatly enhanced conservation at VP7-frame synonymous sites within the ORFX region. the 3'-extent of the conservation is much greater in segment 7 than other segments. the close proximity of the ORFX AUG codon to the VP7 AUG codon may further enhance initiation at the latter, via the translation initiation coupling mechanism described in Ref. [24]. the null model is that the sequence in the ORFX region is only coding in the +0 (VP7 CDS) frame. positive scores favour the alternative model. the VP7 CDS has two closely spaced AUG codons in one sequence. the next codon is 64 nt downstream and only heads a 42-codon ORF. cytorhabdoviruses comprise a genus within the family Rhabdoviridae. (2-4) Positions of stop codons in each of the three forward reading frames. note the conserved absence of stop codons in each of the three forward reading frames. the ORFX AUG codon has poor Kozak context ('U' at -3, 'A' or 'C' at +4; cf. [30]). a significant proportion of ribosomes can translate the P CDS via leaky scanning. a similar overlapping CDS occurs in certain paramyxovirus genera. coronaviruses are currently classified into three main groups. a core set of sgRNA-encoded structural proteins (S, E, M, N) are conserved throughout all groups. a variable number of auxilliary proteins are also encoded by sgRNAs. 73-81% of NS6 (91-108 codons) are overlapping the NS6 CDS in the +1 reading frame. the proposed new coding sequence, ORFX, overlaps the NS6 CDS in the +1 reading frame. the termination codon of the upstream M CDS overlaps the AUG initiation codon of the NS6 CDS as UAAUG; Figure 8. potential, albeit imperfect, TRSs may mean that a separate sgRNA is produced for ORFX. ORFX appears amenable to translation via leaky scanning from the same sgRNA as ORF3. there are no intervening AUG codons in any frame between the ORF3 AUG codon and the ORFX AUG codon. ORF3 is subject to significantly stronger functional constraints than ORFX. sequence data for bat coronavirus 1A/1B/HKU8 ORF3 and ORFX. colour coding is as follows: blue - ORF3 initiation codon; green - potential ORFX initiation codon; yellow (olive) - flanking nucleotides matching the optimal (suboptimal) Kozak context. geneBank and alignments were generated using standard bioinformatics software (blast [40], clustal [41] and EMBOSS [42]. the following astrovirus sequences with complete coverage of ORF2 were used for the alignment and statistics illustrated in Figure 1. the seadornavirus, cytorhabdovirus and coronavirus sequences used are listed in Figures 4, 6, 8 and 10.
