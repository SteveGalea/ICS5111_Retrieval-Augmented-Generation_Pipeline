{"summary": "helicases are complex molecular motors that use ATP to fuel nucleic acid base pair separation and/or rearrangement. some helicases grab one strand of DNA or RNA and move along it to displace its complement. some helicases grab one strand of DNA or RNA and move along it to displace its complement. non-ring helicases38 consist of two RecA-like domains covalently linked in tandem on the same polypeptide. ATP binding and hydrolysis cause a non-ring helicase to expand and contract. both ring and non-ring helicases must first load on single-stranded DNA (or RNA) before they can separate a duplex. SF3 helicases discussed below include viral DNA helicases encoded by human papillomaviruses (HPVs)53, 54 and polyomaviruses (e.g., simian virus 40 [SV40]) all SF4 helicases discussed below, as targets for new antibiotics, resemble the E. coli DnaB hexamer. pathogenic strains of E. coli cause more than 100 million gastrointestinal infections each year and about 170,000 deaths. other gram-negative pathogenic bacteria encode an SF4 DnaB-like helicase that they use to coordinate leading and lagging strand DNA replication. 62 RecA binds the 3\u2032 overhang and helps it invade a homologous duplex to form a DNA crossover to be resolved at a Holliday junction. pathogenic bacteria, such as the ulcer causing Helicobacter pylori, encode RecBCD homologues. helicase inhibitor-based drugs target an HSV helicase. papillomaviridae have a circular genome like SV40, but the papillomavirus genome is larger and more complex. more than 120 different strains of HPV infect more than 440 million people, and they cause about 250,000 deaths per year. hexamers form at each replication fork at either end of a replication bubble. the internal DNA binding hairpins form a spiral staircase. the most widely studied viral helicase is the nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) encoded by HCV. NS3 is an SF2, non\u2013ring, 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 helicase. NS3 proteases are active only when combined with another viral peptide. NS3 proteases are active only when combined with another viral peptide. cellular helicases hijack cellular helicases during viral replication. human cellular helicases DDX1, DDX3, DDX24, DDX24, DDX24, RNA helicase A (RHA) and Werner syndrome protein (WRN) have been linked to human immunodeficiency virus replication. helicase inhibitors cause DNA strand breaks that need to be repaired by homologous recombination. many of the human proteins needed for recombinational DNA repair resemble the E. coli helicase RecQ protein. helicase inhibitors that target human RecQ-like helicases could make cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy. helicase inhibitors of such helicases could be used to treat cancers. the best-studied example is the RNA helicase eIF4A, which prepares mRNA for ribosome binding by unwinding secondary structures in the 5\u2032 untranslated region. RNA interference is the main technique used to demonstrate that a helicase is a potential therapeutic target. the primary motivation to discover potent and specific helicase inhibitors is to control the ability of an organism to access genetic material. antibiotics could be developed from potent and specific inhibitors of bacterial helicases, such as the DnaB55 protein that acts at bacterial replication forks. methicillin-resistant S. aureus is resistant to penicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. the other bacterial helicase targets discussed here are the non-ring helicases that form the multifunctional RecBCD complex. virus encodes seven proteins needed for DNA replication. the origin binding protein UL9, the single-stranded DNA binding protein ICP8, and a heterotrimeric helicase-primase complex. UL5 is an SF1 helicase, and it unwinds in a 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction. the polyomavirus SF3 helicase is the large tumor antigen (TAg) TAg contains an N-terminal J-domain, which stimulates the ATPase activity of the Hsp70 chaperone. TAg forms two hexamers at the origin of DNA replication that move in opposite directions as the replication bubble opens and DNA is copied. RNA helicases encoded by viruses and cellular helicases needed for virus replication. most widely studied viral helicase is the nonstructural protein 3 (NS3) encoded by HCV. NS3 is an SF2, non\u2013ring, 3\u2032 to 5\u2032 helicase. helicases have an RNA triphosphatase activity, meaning they can cleave the terminal phosphate present at the 5\u2032-end of RNA, to prepare the genome for capping. most HCV patients are unaware because the virus destroys the liver so slowly that it causes few symptoms. s DDX1, DDX3, DDX24, DDX24, DDX24, DDX24, RNA helicase A (RHA) and Werner syndrome protein (WRN) have been linked to human immunodeficiency virus replication. all six are SF2 helicases. there are five known human RecQ-like proteins: RECQ1, WRN, BLM, RecQ4 and RecQ5. mutations in the WRN gene (RECQL2) cause Werner syndrome. mutations in the BLM gene (RECQL3) cause Bloom syndrome. RNA helicase eIF4A prepares mRNA for ribosome binding by unwinding secondary structures in the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) cells exposed to an eIF4A inhibitor show reduced expression of an oncoprotein that has been linked to breast cancer, called Mucin 1.106. RNA interference is the main technique used to demonstrate that a helicase is a potential therapeutic target. protein kinases,118 can be modified to detect helicase-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis. it is measured by monitoring either the loss of ATP or the appearance of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) or inorganic phosphate (Pi) most phosphate assays are based on the Fiske-SubbaRow method119. ATPase assays link ATP hydrolysis to either nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) reduction via pyruvate kinase and lactate dehydrogenase125 or methylthioguanosine (MESG) hydrolysis via purine nucleoside phosphorylase.122, 126 Neither coupled assay is particularly useful in HTS because many small molecules absorb in same wavelengths as NADH and ME the prototype helicase unwinding end-point assay measures the conversion of double-stranded DNA to single-stranded DNA using an isotope-labeled oligonucleotide. such assays can be adapted to HTS using GeneClean Glassmilk (MP Biomedicals, Santa Ana, CA) or by using a scintillation proximity assay (SPA), where a radiolabeled oligonucleotide is captured similar assays have been developed that monitor fluorescence polarization139 or time-resolved fluorescence instead of fluorescence intensity. in such a molecular beacon-based helicase assay, substrate fluorescence decreases when ATP activates the helicase. an MBHA has two advantages over other FRET-based assays. the BILS series stabilizes a helicase/primase:DNA complex, possibly preventing the primase recycling needed to initiate new Okazaki fragments. BILS 22 BS (CID 3010846), BAY 57-1293 (CID 491941), and ASP2151 (CID 11397521) the Bayer compounds were discovered using a cell-based high-throughput cell survival assay. ASP2151 is an oxadiazolylphenyl-containing compound that inhibits purified UL5/8/52-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (IC50 = 78 nM), primer synthesis (IC50 30 nM), and DNA unwinding (IC50 100 nM). resistance to ASP2151 is 1000 times less common than seen for acyclovir. biphenyls have been studied as inhibitors of SV40 TAg,124, 128 HPV E1,155 and DDX3,156 and triphenylmethanes have been twice studied as NS3 inhibitors. the most promising screening hit was a biphenysulfonacetic acid (CID 515118; Fig. 2A), which inhibits HPV6 E1 500 times more potently than CID 515118. illomavirus (HPV) helicase inhibitors found a potent N,N\u2032-diarylurea (CID 29766776; Fig. 2B) DDX3 helicase inhibitor (IC50 = 5 M), which also inhibits HIV-1 replication in cell-based assays (IC50 = 15 M) the team tested compounds in the NIH collection for their ability to inhibit SV40 TAg-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (AID 1909) Bisphenol A inhibits TAg with an IC50 value of 41 M. bithionol and hexachlorophene inhibit SV40 and BKV cell culture, and they are less toxic than BPA. blue HT was found to dock in the ATP binding site and inhibit NS3 in assays with an IC50 value of 40 M. ATA also inhibits human RECQ1-catalyzed DNA unwinding and the BLM helicase (AID 2528) on either side of a dihydroxychromone, the compound inhibits both Nsp13-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis (IC50 = 4 M) and DNA unwinding (IC50 = 11 M) similar compounds with only one arylmethyl or catechol group do not inhibit the SARS-CoV helicase. pticine, mitoxantrone, nalidixic acid, or netropsin have been studied as helicase inhibitors since the first studies were done with herpes UL9164 and the human RecQ-like proteins. many DNA binding pharmacophores, such as anthracyclines, acridones, tropolones, and amidinoanthracyclines, have been optimized as HCV helicase inhibitors. it may be possible to use small molecules that bind certain sequences or mimic DNA structures to target specific helicases needed in a disease pathway. porphyrins that mimic a G-quadruplex inhibit the RecQ helicase,172 and similar bismuth porphyrin complexes inhibit the SARS helicase. symmetrical benzimidazoles inhibit HCV helicase by binding in place of RNA,177. many retain ability to interact with nucleic acids,178 so they are rather promiscuous, inhibiting NS3 from flaviviruses. e group.142 their potency in helicase assays correlate with the length of the benzothiazole chain. they inhibit NS3h by preventing the protein from binding single-stranded DNA or RNA. they also displace unrelated proteins from single-stranded DNA or RNA. the compounds stain live cells harboring subgenomic HCV replicons. some derivatives decrease the amount of HCV RNA present in a hepatoma cell line with an enhanced ability to harbor HCV replicons. new inhibitors of helicase-catalyzed DNA unwinding include coumarins (5 compounds), benzothiazoles (2 compounds), rhodanines (4 compounds), triazines (2 compounds), N-phenylpyrroles (2 compounds), and three not easily classified compounds. the most promising DnaB inhibitor in this set is coumarins (5 compounds), benzothiazoles (2 compounds), rhodanines (4 compounds), triazines (2 compounds), tri the aminocoumarin scaffold has been further optimized. the compound incorporates a biphenyl moiety reminiscent of phamacophore seen in SV40 and HPV inhibitors. the NIH Chemical Genomics Center performed a quantitative high-throughput screen to measure IC50 values for more than 250,000 compounds in assays. Hits include compounds such as triphenylmethanes, biphenyls, DNA binding compounds, suramin, and anthracenediones. this project led to the development of a potent, selective BLM inhibitor that became NIH molecular probe ML216 (CID 49852229; Fig. 189 polycyclic aromatic polymers as NS3 Inhibitors Li et al.142 used the MBHA to design specific NS3 inhibitors from polycyclic aromatic polymers purified from the yellow dye primine. the basic scaffold of the primine derivatives is similar to the symmetrical benzothiazole polymers (e.g., (BIP)2B, CID 247520; Fig.3) that were first noted to inhibit HCV helicase by Vir dye primuline is composed of two major and four minor components. all are 1- to 4-unit-long benzothiazole oligomers terminating with a p-aminobenzene group. they inhibit NS3h by preventing the protein from binding single-stranded DNA or RNA. most of the primine derivatives absorb light near 360 nm and emit light near 500 nm. the compounds stain live cells harboring subgenomic HCV replicons. some derivatives decrease the amount of HCV RNA present in a hepatoma cell line. the most potent, CID 4041506, inhibits the growth of gram-positive bacteria, such as S. aureus, with an MIC of 4 g/mL. new inhibitors of helicase-catalyzed DNA unwinding include coumarins, benzothiazoles and r. the most promising DnaB inhibitor in this set is an aminocoumarin (CID 1296013; Fig. 4A) that inhibits growth of a variety of gram-positive bacteria (MIC 5 g/mL) the optimized compound incorporates a biphenyl moiety reminiscent of the phamacophore seen in SV40 and HPV inhibitors. more extensive screens have been performed with the WRN (AID 651767), RECQ1 (AID 2549) and BLM (AID 2528) helicases. the NIH Chemical Genomics Center performed a quantitative high-throughput screen to measure IC50 values for more than 250,000 compounds in assays. AID 651768) does not inhibit HCV helicase, Dengue helicase, Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase, or the E. coli DNA polymerase I, Klenow fragment polymerase. the impressive development of E1-E2 interaction inhibitors has been recently reviewed. inhibitors for the human papillomavirus (HPV) E1-E2 interaction. CHEMBL1207308, IC50 = 0.006 M206; CID 11330698, IC50 = 0.02 M.54 (B) Inhibitors for the simian virus 40 (SV40) TAg-Hsp70 interaction. Mousseau et al.192 designed an AlphaScreen to detect the interaction between the NS3 helicase and HCV core. core peptides and an indoline alkaloid-type compound disrupt the core\u2013NS3 helicase interaction. SL201 also prevents core from forming dimers, suggesting that core dimers must form in order for core to bind NS3. eIF4A inhibitors often block translation of capped RNA. but not translation initiated from an IRES, like the one used to initiate HCV polyprotein synthesis. both enzymes produce light but with different substrates. inhibitors found using assays monitoring the biological function of helicases. recBCD prevents phages lacking Chi sites in their DNA from infecting E. coli. two of the most potent of these RecBCD inhibitors are CID 1045135 and CID 2295461. in helicase assays, both compounds specifically inhibit RecBCD helicase. only a few highly potent and specific helicase inhibitors have been developed. a multidisciplinary approach that combines novel in vitro and cell-based screening methods, structural biology, and rational design will be needed. the authors declared no potential conflicts of interest with respect to the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article."}
