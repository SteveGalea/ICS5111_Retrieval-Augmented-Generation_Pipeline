{"summary": "12% of human cancers are associated with infectious agents, including parasites, bacteria, and viruses. seven different viruses have been causally linked to human oncogenesis. otide acid hybridization 1983\u20131984 Cervical carcinoma, head and neck carcinoma, anogenital cancer Durst et al., 1983; Boshart et al., 1984 Hepatitis C cDNA cloning 1989 HCC Choo et al., 1989 Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma associated herpesvirus Representational difference analysis 1994 Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, Castleman\u2019s a unique antigen was identified in MT-1 cells derived from ATL. a special exception is the X-chromosome-linked lymphoproliferative disorder (XLP) found in some EBV-infected patients. cell and animal models have the potential to provide novel insights into the biology of otherwise unculturable infectious agents and to identify the tumorigenic potential of a virus. this strategy was successfully used in acute infection with African green monkey kidney cells to identify previously uncharacterized human coronavirus. hepatitis B is caused by a virus (HBV) hepatitis B is a disease now known as hepatitis B. a randomly primed cDNA library was constructed from plasma of chimpanzees injected with serum. bacteriophage gt11 was expressed in Escherichia coli. one clone encoded antigen that showed specific seroreactivity in non-A, non-B hepatitis patients. novel virus discovery by screening recombinant expression libraries from infected tissues against patient sera represented a significant breakthrough. high-risk HPV18 was subsequently identified by low stringency hybridization with HPV 8, 9, 10 and 11-related sequences. zur Hausen\u2019s (1999) research group identified both HPV16 and 18 which together are responsible for approximately 70% of invasive cervical cancers. Virochip was invented to detect a broad spectrum of viruses in a single analysis. XMRV was found to have arisen during the passage of a human prostate cancer in mice. the resulting XMRV infected human prostate cancer cells due to its xenotropic host range. this method is commonly known as consensus sequence-base PCR or degenerate PCR. representational difference analysis (RDA) combines physical subtractive hybridization with gene amplification to detect differences between tumor genomic DNA and that of normal cells. novel viral fragments were identified in AIDS patients and further characterized as human Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma associated herpesvirus. a total of 27,840 cDNA sequences were generated and filtered against known human sequences. 10 (accounting for 0.03% of total sequences analyzed) were from EBV viruses. these results suggest that it is possible to identify viral sequences by sampling fewer than 10,000 sequences. retrovirus particles with type C morphology were observed in thin-section electron micrographs of fixed, pelleted cellular materials from two T-cell lymphoblastoid cell lines. similar type C particles were identified in MT-1 cells derived from adult T cell leukemia (HTLV-1), which is now known to be caused by HTLV-1. the robust replication of a virus often gives rise to CPE. this involves morphological changes in the host cell, such as cell rounding, disorientation, swelling or shrinking, detachment from the culture surface, and cell death. the cells being studied are a good model in which to amplify the genome of the putative virus. hypothesize a relationship between leukemia, the unknown agent, and genetic polymorphism(s) in Australia. a randomly primed cDNA library was constructed from the plasma of a randomly primed phage expression library. the cDNA library was constructed from the plasma of a chimpanzee. cDNA was inserted into the bacteriophage gt11 and expressed in Escherichia coli. expressed proteins were then screened against serum from an infected non-A, non-B hepatitis patient. one clone encoded an antigen that showed specific seroreactivity in non-A, non-B hepatitis patients. high-risk HPV18 was subsequently identified by low stringency hybridization with HPV 8, 9, 10 and 11-related sequences. Virochip was successfully used to identify a previously uncharacterized coronavirus isolated from a SARS patient during the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome. XMRV was found to have arisen during the passage of a human prostate cancer in mice. the resulting XMRV infected human prostate cancer cells due to its xenotropic host range. it is possible to combine short-primer hybridization and the power of PCR to amplify potential viral sequences. RDA combines physical subtractive hybridization with gene amplification to detect differences between tumor genomic DNA and that of normal cells. novel viral fragments were identified in AIDS patients and further characterized as human Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma associated herpesvirus. a total of 27,840 cDNA sequences were generated and filtered by computational subtraction against known human sequences, leaving 32 non-matching sequences. the results suggest that it is possible to identify viral sequences by sampling fewer than 10,000 sequences. if no viral transcript is found, the possibility of viral etiology in human cancers. expressing transcript in a given tumor can be excluded above a certain threshold level. L-SAGE libraries were constructed from BCBL1, a KSHV positive cell line and squamous cell conjunctival carcinoma (SCCC) short cDNA tags were sequenced for whole transcriptome analysis. a total of 395,734 sequences were subtracted through DTS analysis. a total of 2,395 \u2018non-human\u2019 sequences were subtracted through DTS analysis. one transcript was similar to but distinct from LPV and human polyomavirus T antigen sequences. the MCV T antigen locus encodes for three major overlapping transcripts. large T (LT), small T (sT) and 57 kT antigens encode overlapping transcripts. MCV LT has conserved N-terminus DnaJ and Rb binding domains. the panT antigen knockdown (both LT and sT) by shRNA results in G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in MCV-positive MCC tumor cells and non-apoptotic cell death. both sT and LT play critical roles in the maintenance of a tumorigenic phenotype in MCC cells. p53 null mice promoter induces high-grade tumors in spleen and liver tissues. these results are consistent with MCV being a human tumor virus encoding T antigen viral oncoproteins. among 13 known human polyomaviruses, eleven have been identified over the past 9 years. zur Hausen (1999) has proposed new criteria for defining a causal role of an infection in human cancers. despite the power of DTS in searching for viral etiologies, there are caveats that should be kept in mind: (1) DTS relies on high database quality and unique features of non-human sequences. transcriptome database generated from human cancers in the TCGA could be a direct resource for DTS. one study revealed a rare bladder cancer with BK polyomavirus integration. a novel enterovirus in colon adenocarcinoma is unlikely to be oncogenic."}
