{"summary": "rhIL-2 is a potent cytokine and FDA-approved anticancer drug. but its clinical use has been limited by severe toxicity. we hypothesize that rhIL-2 in alternate forms may exert stronger antitumor efficacy and less toxicity. pIL-2 may bypass the current limitations of rhIL-2 and serve as a more effective and tolerable anticancer drug."}
