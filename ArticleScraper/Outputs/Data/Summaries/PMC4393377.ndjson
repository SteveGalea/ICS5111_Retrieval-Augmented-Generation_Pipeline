{"summary": "organic carbamates (or urethanes) are structural elements of many approved therapeutic agents. they are widely used as a peptide bond surrogate in medicinal chemistry. this is mainly due to their chemical stability and capability to permeate cell membranes. the carbamate motif is becoming the choice for peptide bond surrogates. the carbamate motif is becoming the choice for peptide bond surrogates. the amide resonance in carbamates has been studied in detail using both experimental and theoretical methods. the amide resonance in carbamates has been shown to be about 3\u20134 kcal mol\u20131 lower than those of amides, owing to the steric and electronic perturbations due to the additional oxygen. a balanced rotamer equilibria and low activation energies render carbamates as optimal conformational switches in molecular devices. only the anti conformation would be expected in five-, six-, and seven-membered cyclic carbamates. acetic acid and 2,6-bis(octylamido)pyridine (3) perturb syn/anti ratio of carbamates 1 and 2. acetic acid moderately stabilizes double hydrogen bonding of the syn rotamer of phenyl carbamate 1. acetic acid favors donation of a hydrogen bond to the more basic pyridyl carbamate. idyl nitrogen and forms the complex shown in Figure 4B. it strongly stabilizes the syn rotamer of 2 (Figure 4D) over the anti rotamer. there is no effect on the syn/anti ratio for 1. carbamates derived from ammonia or aliphatic amines are sufficiently long-lived. an example is represented by cefoxitin (4), a second-generation cephalosporin antibiotic. the classical method for this transformation, involving the use of an alkaline solution of bromine, is unsatisfactory and unreliable. a variety of oxidants and bases have been proposed as modified agents, e.g., iodine(III) reagents such as PhI(OAc)2,47 MeOBr,48 NBS-CH3ONa,49 NBS-KOH,46 lead tetraacetate,50 and benzyltri carbon dioxide is well-known to react rapidly with amines to form carbamic acid ammonium salts. the subsequent reaction of carbamate salts with alkyl halides does not selectively provide urethanes. phosgene is the most commonly used reagent for the preparation of carbamates. several new alkoxycarbonylating agents have been developed. these methods are often used for the synthesis of carbamates in drug design. mixed carbonates with a p-nitrophenyl moiety are frequently used for the preparation of a large range of carbamates. BTBC was prepared from 6-trifluoromethyl-1-hydroxybenzotriazole and trichloromethyl chloroformate and purified by washing with dry ether. the carbonates were treated with amines in the presence of 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP), providing the corresponding carbamates (Scheme 2 and Table 2). examples of Carbamate Formation from 2-Pyridyl-Based Mixed Carbonates. we investigated the scope of N,N\u2032-disuccinimidyl carbonate (10, DSC)81 promoted alkoxycarbonylation of amines. the use of triethylamine as a promoter has a notable effect on the yield and the rate of the alkoxycarbonylation process (Scheme 2 and Table 5). more recently, Yoon and co-workers exploited 2-substituted-pyridazin-3(2H)-ones as electrophilic transfer reagents. carbon dioxide was supplied by bubbling it into the reaction suspension. the reaction conditions are convenient for purification. the reactions undergo complete conversions. TBAI helps to minimize overalkylation of the produced carbamate. urethane synthesis from an alcohol and CO2 is catalyzed by metal complexes such as dialkyltin and dialkyltin. bipyridines and phenanthrolines with strong coordinating abilities were the better choice for obtaining urethanes in high yields. it is important to note that the Ni-phenanthroline system is more active and less toxic than dialkyl(oxo)tin under the same reaction conditions. benzyl azodicarboxylate, DBAD, and tributylphosphine in a reaction with gaseous carbon dioxide. this reaction did not proceed through the isocyanate intermediate but rather through an SN2 displacement of the activated alcohol. this hypothesis is supported by the observed inversion of stereochemistry upon conversion of a chiral secondary alcohol to the corresponding carbamate. carbamoylimidazolium salts are readily prepared by the sequential treatment of secondary amines with N,N\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) and iodomethane (Scheme 9) authors envisaged that the carbamoylimidazolium salts, while relatively unreactive with alcohols, would react with nucleophlic alkoxides to produce the carbamates. KF/Al2O3 basicity stems from the formation of KOH in the initial preparation of the solid-supported material by the reaction of KF with alumina supports. hypochlorite ion is the predominant form of chlorine, reacting with the amide to form an N-chloroamide. curtius rearrangement can be promoted only at higher temperatures (40 vs 75 \u00b0C) alkyl chloroformates are the most frequently used reagents for the preparation of carbamates, although the need of an excess amount limits their usefulness. the method shows the generality for a wide variety of sterically diverse amines and alcohols. the method shows the generality for a wide variety of sterically diverse amines and alcohols. 3-Nitro-1,2,4-triazole (NT)120 could be easily removed from the reaction due to its insolubility in dichloromethane or chloroform. NT-based reagents have a series of benefits such as high stability, since they can be stored for long periods without decomposition. binuclear rhodium complex [(Ph3P)4Rh2(-OH)2]2C6H6 was employed as an effective catalyst for the reductive carbonylation of nitrobenzenes to carbamate esters. a Rh(CO)4(PPN) or Ru(CO)12 0.2 mmol, alcohol, 30 mL, PhNO2 (10.0 mmol), CO, 400 psi, 140 \u00b0C aliphatic ureas show higher reactivity compared to aromatic ureas due to their higher basicity. the basic DBTO is supposed to work as a nucleophile by attacking the carbonyl carbon of the carbonate. recently, padiya and co-workers reported a useful method for preparing carbamates in an aqueous media by the use of CDI. they found that 1,1\u2032-carbonyldiimidazole (CDI) rapidly reacts in aqueous media with amine to give good yields of the corresponding N-substituted carbonylimidazolide. the Hofmann rearrangement (Method I, Scheme 1) is well-recognized as a useful method to convert primary carboxamides to amines or carbamates. the classical method for this transformation is unsatisfactory and unreliable. curtius rearrangement (Method II, Scheme 1) is the thermal decomposition of acyl azides into the isocyanate intermediate. this method is widely used in the transformation of carboxylic acids into carbamates and ureas. the acid chloride method is not suitable for acid-sensitive functionalities. the formation of carbamates from isocyanates is fundamentally important to polyurethane industries. the readily available alkyl chloroformates are the most frequently used reagents for the preparation of carbamates. however, these reagents display major drawbacks, as a large excess of base and a long reaction time are required. examples of carbamate derivatives shown in Table 1.
