{"summary": "in the mid-1990s, the causative agent of ISA was identified as an orthomyxovirus. it targets endothelial, gill epithelial, and erythrocyte cells of fish. a single virus-encoded glycoprotein facilitates both host cell attachment and membrane fusion. a series of conformational rearrangements culminate in the formation of an energetically stable bundle of anti-parallel helical hairpins. ISAV entry is similar to other orthomyxoviruses where receptor binding to sialic acids initiates an internalization process into endosomes. however, a major difference exists in the functional organization of the key viral glycoproteins involved in entry. a crystal structure of the ISAV F core fusion protein is presented at a resolution of 2.1. this represents the first structure of any ISAV entry glycoprotein. our model clearly illustrates that the ISAV F protein fusion glycoprotein adopts a traditional class I viral fusion architecture. struct Design and Protein Production DNA corresponding to ISAV F (residues 1\u2013444) and IAV HA (residues 382\u2013519) were codon-optimized and commercially synthesized.

AV F protein and other orthomyxoviral glycoproteins with fusion activity predict similar secondary structural elements that correspond with the core fusion protein of previously annotated orthomyxoviral fusion proteins. we designed our initial E. coli expression construct within the bounds of the predicted fusion peptide at ISAV F residues 277\u2013293 and the predicted transmembrane domain at residues 413\u2013435. meric ISAV F294\u2013383 core fusion protein generates layers of hydrophobic residues followed by polar interactions. black residue labels denote hydrophobic residues, red labels correspond to negatively charged residues and green labels indicate a polar uncharged residue. ISAV is the first orthomyxovirus to our knowledge. there are two chloride coordination sites within the central core. the trimeric nature of the central coiled-coil allows the formation of two asparagine layers (Asn340 and Asn347) to coordinate the two chloride ions. fusion core was stabilized as it was subjected to an increasingly acidic environment. the IAV HA fusion core (Tm = 86.5 \u00b0C; pH 4.5) showed greater thermal stability overall than ISAV F294\u2013404. in vivo, there is an extensive conformational change that occurs between the pre- and post-fusion species of the IAV HA protein. the molar ellipticity of 12 m IAV HA383\u2013519 (A) and 20 m ISAV F294\u2013404 (B) was measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C in buffers with pH values ranging from 4.5 through 7.5. all thermal melts were performed in triplicate with independently purified recombinant protein. motif and a CX6CC motif within structured chain reversal regions (28\u201330), IAV HA, IBV HA, and ISAV F proteins all generate similar post-fusion bundles that lack an appreciable chain reversal region. however, in the ISAV F protein structure, the chain reversal region is capped by neutral polar residues, Tyr357 and Asn359, generating a polar environment. electrostatic interactions lock outer helices into core helical bundle to generate conformational rearrangement necessary for fusion. glu327 participates in a 2.6 O\u2013H\u2013O hydrogen bond with Glu329 of the neighboring helix specifically when the molecule is subjected to low pH (33, 34) incubation of ISAV F294\u2013404 with 1 m urea failed to stabilize the fusion subunit and resulted in 2 \u00b0C decrease of the apparent Tm at all pHs assayed. the molar ellipticities of recombinant ISAV F core protein constructs were measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C in buffers with pH values of 7.5, 6.5 and 5.5. all melts were performed in triplicate with independently purified recombinant protein. data are represented as mean melting temperature S.D. 0.6 \u00b0C is not discernible in the graphs. glu69:Glu74 carboxyl-carboxylate is locked in by the Glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate at the pH of fusion. the protein is locked in by strong short O\u2013H\u2013O bonds at the pH of fusion. stability assays at various pH values indicate that our protein has largely lost the stability profile associated with a pH-dependent fusion protein. extended coil region affected the stability of the protein at pH 7.5, pH 6.5, and pH 5.5. however, the relative increase in thermal stability at the pH of fusion was maintained. incubation of the truncated construct with 1 m GuHCl had the same results as with the full-length ISAV F construct. however, it is easily removed by limited tryptic or directed thrombin proteolysis. the post-fusion structure of the ISAV F294\u2013383 reported herein illustrates an apparently simpler chain reversal region when compared with other known post-fusion orthomyxoviral fusion proteins. despite the qualitative similarities of our post-fusion model to the overall fold of post-fusion IAV and IBV HA2, it is not clear whether the ISAV F gene evolved with the orthomyxoviral fusion proteins. fusion proteins including parainfluenza virus 5 F and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) and various other core structures of HIV gp41 were both used as search models. the conservation of the trimeric coiled-coil within post-fusion viral glycoproteins has been previously shown by Igonet et al. arrows point to heptad repeat stutter regions identified by Igonet et al. (41, 42) arrows point to the heptad repeat stutter regions identified by Igonet et al. (41, 42) ISAV is the only known member of the Orthomyxoviridae genera with attachment and fusion activities on disparate proteins. ISAV is the only known member of the Orthomyxoviridae genera with attachment and fusion activities on disparate proteins. paramyxoviruses present attractive mechanistic model of fusion that may apply to ISAV fusion. fusion proteins from paramyxoviruses have a large structured domain that intersects the helices that make up the prototypical post-fusion helical bundle. idue chain reversal region reported for post-fusion ISAV F294\u2013404. the ISAV fusion protein is structurally similar to the entry proteins of other orthomyxoviruses. but the ISAV F fusion core does not encode for readily ionizable histidine residues. in each viral fusion protein, a high propensity for helical secondary structure is observed for the last 120 amino acids of the primary sequence. these helices are sandwiched between two regions predicted by TMPRED (10) to be transmembrane domains. in influenza virus glycoproteins, these predicted regions have been experimentally determined to be the fusion peptide and transmembrane anchor. ISAV is the only orthomyxovirus to isolate its fusion activity from receptor binding and/or destroying activities. fusion proteins from IAV, IBV, and ICV viruses have been experimentally determined (21\u201323) ISAV F294\u2013383 is composed of an extended central coiled-coil that abruptly breaks at Tyr357, facilitating the positioning of the C-terminal helix against the neighboring protein chain. two chloride ions coordinated by Asn340 and Asn347, respectively, are shown as green spheres. the outer helix on ISAV F spirals back to pack against an adjacent ISAV chain. this is unlike the IAV hemagglutinin, which folds directly back onto itself to form a true hairpin. the trimeric nature of the central coiled-coil allows the formation of two asparagine layers to coordinate the two chloride ions. both IAV and ISAV host-viral envelope fusion events are pH-dependent. the recombinant IAV HA fusion core is stabilized as the pH is adjusted to that of viral fusion in a biological system. a conformational change occurs between the pre- and post-fusion species of the IAV HA protein. the molar ellipticity of 12 m IAV HA383\u2013519 (A) and 20 m ISAV F294\u2013404 (B) was measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C in buffers with pH values ranging from 4.5 through 7.5. data were normalized between 0 (folded) and 1 (unfolded) and fit to a nonlinear biphasic sigmoidal curve in GraphPad Prism IAV HA, IBV HA, and ISAV F proteins all generate similar post-fusion bundles that lack an appreciable chain reversal region. a single conservative point mutation (R106H) at the apex of the chain reversal region in the post-fusion conformation of IAV HA can alter the pH of glycoprotein-catalyzed fusion events. fusion occurs and the metastable fusion protein becomes an irreversible helical bundle. changes in the thermal stability of this conformation negatively correlate with the pH requirements of fusion. in class I viruses that fuse in a pH-independent fashion, multiple intra- and intermolecular electrostatic interactions lock the outer helices into the core helical bundle to generate the post-fusion conformation. the increased NaCl in the protein buffer solution only modestly increased the thermal stability of the protein by 3 \u00b0C at pH 7.5 and pH 6.5. however, there was no apparent change in the stability of ISAV F294\u2013404 at the pH of fusion. the Tm of ISAV F294\u2013404 E327A,E329A,E329A, was incubated with 0.5 m NaCl, 1 m GuHCl, or 1 m urea overnight and melted at pH 7.5, 6.5, and 5.5. the control protein melt was not incubated with any additional salts or chaotropes. IAV HA switches between the electrostatic HA1-Arg120:HA2-Glu69 to a familiar intramolecular Glu69:Glu74 carboxyl-carboxylate as the pH lowers to that of IAV HA-mediated fusion. the protein is locked in by the Glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate at the pH of fusion by strong short O\u2013H\u2013O bonds. the ablation of the Glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate destabilizes the molecule at pH 5.5 and stabilizes the molecule at near neutral pH values. our structure does not include the membrane-proximal C-terminal fragment that is visualized as an extended coil packed against the core in the post-fusion structures of IAV HA and IBV HA. however, the lack of the extended coil region affected the overall stability of the protein at pH 7.5, pH the ISAV F protein is cleaved into two subunits during viral maturation by host proteases (7). the disulfide-linked organization of processed F protein is also thought to be analogous to the influenza A hemagglutinins. however, mutation of individual cysteine residues in recombinant ISAV F294\u2013404 resulted in disulfide-mediated aggregation of our recombinant trimer. p41 heptad repeat 1 (PDB: 3UIA) comprises the central coiled-coil of the post-fusion structure. alignment yielded a Z-score of 4.9 and an RMSD of 1.3 within the aligned region. trimmed structures of these proteins were both used as search models. the trimeric ISAV F F294\u2013383 crystal structure was aligned to structures within the PDB using the Dali server. colored in blue are fragments that were not aligned by the Dali server, and fragments colored in pink were aligned.

HA, IBV HA, ICV HEF, and ISAV F proteins were used for protein secondary structure (A), transmembrane propensity (B) and coiled-coil propensity (C). fusion proteins from IAV, IBV, and ICV viruses have been experimentally determined. ISAV F294\u2013383 is composed of an extended central coiled-coil that abruptly breaks at Tyr357, facilitating the positioning of the C-terminal helix against the neighboring protein chain. the packing generates layers of hydrophobic residues followed by polar interactions. the central coiled-coil region abruptly breaks at Tyr357, forming a helical hairpin that switches back and continues for another four turns. the outer helix on ISAV F spirals back to pack against an adjacent ISAV chain. this is unlike the IAV hemagglutinin, which folds directly onto itself to form a true hairpin. ISAV F294\u2013404 and IAV HA382\u2013519 core fusion protein occluded by leu91 and Trp92. thermal stability of IAV and ISAV host-viral envelope fusion events is pH-dependent. inverse correlation between thermal stability and pH has previously been demonstrated. the molar ellipticity of 12 m IAV HA383\u2013519 (A) and 20 m ISAV F294\u2013404 (B) was measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C in buffers with pH values ranging from 4.5 through 7.5. the molar ellipticity of 20 m ISAV F294\u2013404 was measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C. the molar ellipticity of 12 m IAV HA383\u2013519 (B) and 20 m ISAV F294\u2013404 (C) was measured from 260 to 190 nm at 20 \u00b0C in buffers with pH values ranging from 4.5 through 7.5. a single conservative point mutation (R106H) at the apex of the chain reversal region in the post-fusion conformation of IAV HA can alter the pH of ISAV F294\u2013404 is 19 \u00b0C lower than that of IAV HA382\u2013519. fusion occurs and the metastable fusion protein becomes an irreversible helical bundle as modeled by the ISAV F294\u2013383 crystal structure. changes in the thermal stability of this conformation negatively correlate with the pH requirements of fusion. glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate electrostatic interaction on the ISAV F core fusion protein acts as a pH sensor. the 500 mm NaCl solution was chosen to approximate the high salinity of seawater. the increased NaCl in the protein buffer solution only modestly increased the thermal stability of the protein by 3 \u00b0C at pH 7.5 and pH 6.5. however, there was no apparent change in the stability of ISAV F294\u2013404 at the pH of fusion the molar ellipticities of recombinant ISAV F core protein constructs were measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C in buffers with pH values of 7.5, 6.5 and 5.5. the control protein melt was not incubated with any additional salts or chaotropes. glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate would generate destabilizing repulsive electrostatics in the fusion protein at neutral and near neutral pH values. this region of the ISAV F protein switches between the electrostatic HA1-Arg120:HA2-Glu69 to a familiar intramolecular Glu69:Glu74 carboxyl-carboxylate as the pH lowers to that of IAV HA-mediated fusion. thermal stability assays on ISAV F294\u2013404 E327A,E329A at pH 7.5. ablation of the Glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate destabilizes the molecule at pH 5.5 and stabilizes the molecule at near neutral pH values. however, the lack of the extended coil region affected the overall stability of the protein at pH 7.5, pH 6.5, and pH 5.5. the HA subunits are bound together via an inter-subunit disulfide bond. it is maintained from pre- to post-fusion (22, 23) unlike IAV and IBV HA, the ISAV F protein is cleaved into two subunits during viral maturation by host proteases (7). however, mutation of individual cysteine residues in recombinant ISAV F294\u2013404 resulted in disulfide-mediated aggregation of IBV HA2 post-fusion structure was not represented within the first 1000 results. the top structural neighbor to ISAV F294\u2013383 was a fragment of the HIV-1 gp41 heptad repeat 1 (PDB: 3UIA), which comprises the central coiled-coil of the post-fusion structure. this alignment yielded a Z-score of 4.9 and an RMSD of 1.3 within the aligned region. the ISAV F protein is a unique member of the orthomyxoviral fusion protein repertoire. it lends further support to a similar post-fusion fold than other orthomyxoviral structures. however, the post-fusion structure of the ICV HEF protein has yet to be described.

ISAV is the only known member of the Orthomyxoviridae genera with attachment and fusion activities on disparate proteins. the physical arrangement of the ISAV entry glycoproteins on the surface of the ISAV virion may explain this apparent strategic divergence. class I fusion proteins from paramyxoviruses have a large structured domain that intersects the helices that make up the prototypical post-fusion helical bundle (45) instead of the four-residue chain reversal region reported for the post-fusion ISAV F294\u2013404. the ISAV F fusion core does not encode for readily ionizable histidine residues. a pairwise alignment between ISAV and ICV fusion proteins results in a 26.5% identity (157 identical and 206 similar positions) in each viral fusion protein, a high propensity for helical secondary structure is observed for the last 120 amino acids of the primary sequence. the ISAV F protein uses a dissimilar primary amino acid sequence from that of its orthomyxoviral cousins to achieve similar tertiary architecture for host-viral fusion. fusion proteins from IAV, IBV, and ICV viruses have been experimentally determined. ISAV F294\u2013383 contains a naturally occurring thrombin cleavage site at residue 383, and this site was also cleaved during proteolysis. each asymmetric unit contains one ISAV F294\u2013383 molecule. the biological trimeric bundle was generated through crystallographic symmetry operators. the overall architecture of ISAV F294\u2013383 is reminiscent of previously determined post-fusion orthomyxoviral fusion proteins. it is composed of a central 14-turn extended coiled-coil with hydrophobic residues packed into the core, away from the bulk solvent. the central coiled-coil region abruptly breaks at Tyr357, forming a helical hairpin that switches back and continues for another four turns. the recombinant IAV HA fusion core is stabilized as the pH is adjusted to that of viral fusion in a biological system. the recombinant IAV HA fusion core is stabilized as the pH is adjusted to that of viral fusion in a biological system. the recombinant IAV HA fusion core is stabilized as the pH is adjusted to that of viral fusion. orthomyxoviral fusion core protein constructs represent these proteins in the post-fusion conformation as CD wavelength spectral scans are superimposable between pH 7.5 and that of fusion. the molar ellipticity of 12 m IAV HA383\u2013519 (A) and 20 m ISAV F294\u2013404 (B) was measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C. the molar ellipticity of 20 m ISAV F294\u2013404 was measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C in acetate buffers with pH values ranging from 4.5 to 5.5. data were normalized between 0 (folded) and 1 (unfolded) and fit to a nonlinear biphasic sigmoidal curve in GraphPad Prism (version 5.01). in the ISAV F protein structure, the chain reversal region is capped by neutral polar residues, Tyr357 and Asn359, generating a polar environment that can interact with the bulk solvent. the observed thermal stability of ISAV F294\u2013404 is 19 \u00b0C lower than that of IAV HA382\u2013519. a 2.6 O\u2013H\u2013O hydrogen bond with Glu329 of the neighboring helix is identified as important mediators of protein stability (36) through truncations and mutations, we hypothesized that the Glu327\u2013Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate electrostatic interaction on the ISAV F core fusion protein acts as a pH sensor. the 500 mm NaCl solution was chosen to approximate the high salinity of seawater. glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate acts as an ISAV F pH sensor. the molar ellipticities of recombinant ISAV F core protein constructs were measured at 217 nm from 20 to 95 \u00b0C in buffers with pH values of 7.5, 6.5 and 5.5. we hypothesized that the Glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate would generate destabilizing repulsive electrostatics in the fusion protein at neutral and near neutral pH values. we hypothesized that the Glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate would generate strong short O\u2013H\u2013O hydrogen bonds at the pH of fusion. stability assays at various pH values indicate that our protein has largely lost the stability profile associated with a pH-dependent class I fusion protein. also, when we performed thermal stability assays on ISAV F294\u2013404 E327A,E329A at pH 7.5, the melting curve became prostrate over an extensive temperature range. however, the ablation of the Glu327:Glu329 carboxyl-carboxylate destabilizes the molecule at pH 5.5 and the membrane-proximal C-terminal fragment lends some stability to the post-fusion conformation of the ISAV F protein. however, it is easily removed by limited tryptic or directed thrombin proteolysis. the HA subunits are bound together via an inter-subunit disulfide bond, which is maintained from pre- to post-fusion. IAV HA2 was ranked very close to the bottom of the list (rank: 637) with a 7% sequence identity, a Z-score of 2.8, and an RMSD of 4.4. the top structural neighbor to ISAV F294\u2013383 was a fragment of the HIV-1 gp41 heptad repeat 1. parallel to our Dali queries, we analyzed our structure with the program SOCKET (20) and found that a stutter region exists between Leu326 and Glu329, within the carboxyl-carboxylate pH sensor. the ISAV F protein is a unique member of the orthomyxoviral fusion protein repertoire. however, the post-fusion structure of the ICV HEF protein has yet to be described.
