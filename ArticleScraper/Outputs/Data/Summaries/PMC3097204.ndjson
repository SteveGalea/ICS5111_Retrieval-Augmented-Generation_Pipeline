{"summary": "ATP-binding cassette (ABC)-type metal transporters provide a considerable amount of different transition metals for bacterial growth. however, the function and structure of the TroA homologue from the epidemic Streptococcus suis isolates have not been characterized. the first human case of S. suis 2 infection was described in 1968. in 1998 and 2005, 240 human infections had been reported in china. this caused a total of 240 human infections and claimed 52 lives. our group, in collaboration with other groups, has sequenced genomes of the representatives of these two virulent S. suis 2 isolates. mutants defective in genes regulating metal ion uptake are able to confer significant protection against S. suis 2 infection in mice [16]. previously, we identified a global zinc-response regulator from S. suis 2 [17], unveiling its relationship with zinc homeostasis. tsA share a common structure of two (/)4 domains linked by a long helix. they share a common structure of two (/)4 domains linked by a long helix. silico analysis revealed that SsTroA is a putative lipoprotein. the conserved lipobox motif is usually characterized as L3-[A/S/T]2-[G/A]1-C+1. the metal binding site of SsTroA is very similar to Mn-specific SBPs. we cloned the mature SsTroA domain (residues 36\u2013317) and the protein was purified using GST-affinity column. a 34-kDa protein band was detected in the S. suis 2 cell lysate. the recombinant protein was subjected to a test of inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analysis. the metal contents of SsTroA as isolated or after reconstitution were shown in Table 1. metal ions Metal in SsTroAa After initial isolation Zn2+ 0.80.02 (n = 3) Mn2+ 0.960.2 (n = 3) Mn2+ 0.890.2 (n = 3) a Mean the standard error of the mean. ITC measures the heat directly released or absorbed upon an interaction triggered by mixing two components. the thermodynamic profiles for metal binding by SsTroA are not identical to those previously reported for TpTroA [31]. the binding enthalpy can become exothermic (H0) if metal binding is coupled to a protein conformational change. X-band EPR spectra of Mn2+-SsTroA at room temperature displays a typical six-line pattern. high-spin Mn2+ centers typically exhibit EPR resonances with characteristic six-line splitting patterns due to hyperfine interactions between the unpaired electrons and the 55Mn nucleus. a significant enhancement in fluorescence is probed on binding of ANS to apo-SsTroA. this fluorescence is slightly diminished in the presence of metal ions. ANS displays stronger binding to Mn2+-SsTroA than Zn2+-SsTroA. binding site, and the Mn2+ causes a greater change than Zn2+ does. decreased plots can be attributed to a more compact and ordered structure for SsTroA in the presence of metal. lidum ZnuA does undergo conformational changes when Zn2+ is loaded. far-UV CD spectra were acquired for apo-SsTroA (purple) and SsTroA in the presence of 100 M Zn2+ (green) or 100 M Mn2+ (red) the ternary protein-metal complex appears to form a compact domain organization, i.e., the metal-ligand interactions in the SsTroA protein indeed play an important role in imparting extra stability to the metal binding site of the protein. the C-terminal domain (residues 196\u2013317) is a / sandwich composed of a four stranded parallel -sheet with 2-1-3-4 linking topology. the two independent domains interact with each other across a large interface that creates the binding pocket for the metal ligand. zinc is pentacoordinated by His 76 (bond length, 2.14 ), His 139 (2.11 ), His 205 (2.18 ) and Asp 289 (2.20, 2.38. the distorted square pyramidal structure is best described as distorted square pyramidal [21] the coordinate geometry of Zn is usually tetrahedral or distorted tetrahedral (coordination number = 4) in the protein. the ion tends to prefer hard ligands such as carboxylate oxygens of aspartate or glutamate, and the carboxamide oxygens of asparagine or glutamine. glu 205 in SsTroA is replaced by Glu 205 at the homologous position in PsaA and Glu 220 in MntC. intriguingly, in the structure of SsTroA, we observed two distinctive flexible loops mainly composed of charged residues. these two flexible loops were designated as Loop 1 (Asn 126-Pro 38) and Loop 2 (Tyr 279-Glu 285) full 1H-15N spectra of SsTroA were acquired in the absence of metal and loaded with Zn2+ or Mn2+. all spectra were acquired at 25\u00b0C in 20. mM sodium acetate (pH 6.5) and spectra were recorded at a 600-MHz 1H frequency. the spectrum of Zn2+-SsTroA (green) is shown in Figure 6A. these dramatic spectral changes indicate that the binding of Zn2+ induces conformational changes, demonstrating the high affinity of the apoprotein toward Zn. silico analysis revealed that SsTroA is a putative lipoprotein. the conserved lipobox motif is usually characterized as L3-[A/S/T]2-[G/A]1-C+1. the conserved cysteine residue is absolutely conserved in all bacterial lipoproteins. SsTroA has a molecular mass of 34 kDa, in consistence with the theoretical monomer molar mass of 32 kDa. analysis of sedimentation velocity profiles using the SEDFIT program yielded the weight average molar mass of the major peak is 31.8 kDa. negative control protein (Ss1661 protein from S. suis 2) were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. a 34-kDa protein band was detected in the S. suis 2 cell lysate. metal binding stoichiometries and binding affinities were investigated. we applied isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) to monitor the energetics of Zn2+ and Mn2+ binding to the apo-SsTroA. the binding stoichiometry was determined to be 1 in both cases. the thermodynamic profiles for metal binding by SsTroA are not identical to those previously reported for TpTroA [31]. the binding enthalpy can become exothermic (H0) if metal binding is coupled to a protein conformational change. spin Mn2+ centers exhibit characteristic six-line splitting patterns due to hyperfine interactions between the unpaired electrons and the 55Mn nucleus. the Mn2+ bound protein reduces the coordination of weakfield water, increasing spin-orbit interactions and zero-field energies relative to that of Mn(H2O)6 2+. both titration traces had similar spectra but with varying intensities of the signal. a significant enhancement in fluorescence is probed on binding of ANS to apo-SsTroA. the fluorescence intensity of ANS clearly decreases in the metal bound form compared to the apo-SsTroA. ANS displays stronger binding to Mn2+-SsTroA than Zn2+. apo-SsTroA is unstable compared to the native SsTroA at room temperature, i.e., we assumed that SsTroA displays metal-dependent conformational stability of SsTroA. we applied CD spectroscopy to obtain further information on the metal sensitivity of the SsTroA. far-UV CD spectra acquired for apo-SsTroA (purple) and SsTroA in the presence of 100 M Zn2+ (green), or 100 M Mn2+ (red) data for apo-SsTroA (purple) followed by far-UV CD spectra at 223 nm. the peptide chain crosses between the two (/)4 domains only once linking the two (/)4 domains via a 33-residue kinked rigid -helical backbone that runs the full length of the molecule. the peptide chain crosses between the two (/)4 domains only once linking the two (/)4 domains via a 33-residue kinked rigid -helical backbone that runs the full length of the molecule independent domains interact with each other across a large interface that creates the binding pocket for the metal ligand. the ion bound in the metal binding pocket of recombinant SsTroA is Zn2+. N2 nitrogen atoms of His 76 and His 139 are provided by the N-terminal domain. the binding site is buried 7 below the molecule surface. the four coordinating residues are also completely buried. the ion tends to prefer hard ligands such as the carboxylate oxygens of aspartate or glutamate, and the carboxamide oxygens of asparagine or glutamine. despite their borderline hardness, the metal coordination geometry is usually square pyramidal or trigonal bipyramidal (coordination number = 5) the TpTroA and S. pneumoniae PsaA structures display a short loop compared to Loop 1 of SsTroA. it is speculated that the mobility of this loop may possess a biological function in SsTroA [26] all cross-peaks represent backbone and side chain amide group. the apoprotein (purple) maintains a similar tertiary structure compared with the metal bound proteins. this suggests that the apo-SsTroA is not randomly unfolded. the spectrum of Zn2+-SsTroA (green) shows a large number of peaks shifts. these dramatic spectral changes indicate that the binding of Zn2+ induces conformational changes, demonstrating the high affinity of the apoprotein toward Zn. this suggests that the protein regions adopt similar tertiary structures when bound to Zn or Mn. to better understand the significant role of the Tro operon for metal transition in S. suis, we screened the S. suis 2 genome [5] for orthologs of known metal-dependent enzymes and metal transporters. we identified 23 Zn-dependent proteins and three Mn-dependent proteins. S. suis does not encode orthologs of either Mn2+-specific MntH transporter or the P-type ATPase, MntA. metal-binding pocket of apo-SsTroA and other locally disordered folding adopts a loosely folded structure in solution. binding of target molecule drives disordered folding to a more ordered state. oA presents high topological identity with lipoprotein PsaA in S. pneumoniae. the latter is a surface-exposed multi-functional protein detected on all known serotypes of S. pneumoniae. there is increasing evidence that surface-related proteins are involved in bacterial pathogenesis, as exemplified by adhesion, invasion, and bacterial defense mechanisms. SsTroA is a substrate binding protein, which is anchored into the membrane via a lipid-anchor. the nucleotide binding domains hydrolyze ATP to drive the transport of the ligand through the membrane. further analysis revealed that Zn2+ and Mn2+ bind to the SsTroA in either the same site or very nearby. the PCR product was cloned into the BamHI/XhoI restriction sites of the pGEX-6P-1 expression vector (Amersham) to generate the pGEX-SsTroA plasmid. this construct was then transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown at 37\u00b0C to mid-log phase in LB broth supplemented with 100 mg/ml ampicillin. protein concentrations were determined by the BCA assay (Pierce) according to the manufacturer's protocol using bovine serum albumin as the standard. samples were grown in M9 minimal medium containing 0.1% 15NH4Cl. the other steps of protein expression and purification were the same as described above. all plasticwares were treated for >2 hours with 0.2 M EDTA. all buffer solutions were passed through chelating Sepharose resin. antisera directed against recombinant SsTroA was produced in rabbits according to the standard protocol. the structure was rebuilt and refined using COOT [62] and REFMAC5 program [63]. the crystals belong to the P43 space group. the final refined structure without water molecules was used as an initial model for the complex structure. ITC Binding of Zn2+ and Mn2+ to apo-SsTroA was determined at 25\u00b0C. metal and protein solutions were prepared in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 6.5. the data were monitored for apo-SsTroA alone and loaded with Zn2+ or Mn2+ at 223 nm with a constant heating rate of 0.5\u00b0C/min,at temperatures between 25\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C. the results analysis yielded the transition temperature (Tm) as described previously. one syringe was loaded with a Mn2+-saturated SsTroA solution. the other was loaded with 100 M ZnSO4 freshly prepared in the same buffer. the sample was incubated for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C prior to recording the EPR spectrum. the pGEX-SsTroA plasmid was cloned into the pGEX-6P-1 expression vector (Amersham) to generate the pGEX-SsTroA plasmid. the plasmid was mixed with 500 M ANS in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) the clarified supernatant was loaded onto a superdex 200 column (GE Healthcare) for 2 hours. bound proteins were cleaved from the resin by incubating with preScission Protease. the protein was verified by SDS-PAGE and high purity fractions were concentrated using a 10-kDa molecular mass cut-off. apo-SsTroA protein was dialyzed against 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) and 20 mM EDTA for 3 days. the protein was then dialyzed against EDTA-free buffers for 3 days. removal of metal was confirmed by ICP-MS. crystals were transferred to the mother liquor containing 30% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray Data were collected using a rotating-anode X-ray generator equipped with an R-AXIS IV image-plate detector. structure was rebuilt and refined using COOT [62] and REFMAC5 program [63] metal content of recombinant SsTroA samples exchanged into metal-free 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 50 mM NaCl, reconstituted SsTroA samples, and buffer controls were determined. each sample was quantified three times and averaged. the heat of dilution is collected by titration with buffer alone. the integrated data were subtracted from data obtained with apo-SsTroA present. the thermal reactions were monitored on the Jasco 810 spectropolarimeter (Jasco Inc.) three scans were collected at a microwave power of 20 mW. the center field of the scans was set to 3,500 G. samples for NMR measurements contained 0.4 mM 15N labeled SsTroA, 95% H2O/5% 2H2O in 20 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 6.5) all NMR spectra were processed and analyzed using Felix software (Accelrys Inc.) two peaks from the gel-filtration show the same SsTroA protein on the SDS-PAGE. table S1 Genome-wide search for genes with zinc- and manganese-involvement."}
