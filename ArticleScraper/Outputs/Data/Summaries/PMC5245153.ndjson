{"summary": "glucocorticoids have been widely used in clinical practice since the 1950s. it is the most common cause of non-traumatic osteonecrosis (2). for the past 40 years, researchers have investigated SANFH. however, its pathogenesis remains unclear. rabbits were bred in individual cages (20\u201330\u00b0C; 30\u201370% humidity, 12 h: 12-h light-dark cycle; free access to feed and water) the animal use protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Soochow University (Suzhou, China) anesthesia was intraperitoneally injected into the rabbits. dual-hip X-ray (V-5000; Phillips Healthcare, DA Best, The Netherlands) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were performed. rabbits were placed in the supine position, with their lower leg flexed and fixed with tape. femoral head necrosis was determined according to the pathological features of empty bone lacuna numbers and surrounding necrotic bone marrow tissues. pathological changes in bone cellular necrosis were expressed as the percentage of empty bone lacunae. the serum IGF-1 level was determined by radioimmunoassay using IGF-1 RIA kits (Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering Technology And Service Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) according to manufacturer's instructions, the serum was stored at 20\u00b0C. group C (n=14), the control group, was prepared using the same protocol as the model group, followed by oral administration of LEV (0.4 g/kg/day; Shanghai Fuda Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) all rabbits were injected with penicillin (800,000 U/per rabbit, twice per week; Harbin Pharmaceutical Group Co., Ltd., Harbin, China) in order to prevent infection. femoral head necrosis was determined according to pathological features of empty bone lacuna numbers and surrounding necrotic bone marrow tissues. pathological changes in bone cellular necrosis were expressed as the percentage of empty bone lacunae out of 50 bone lacunae. five fields were randomly selected under 400 magnification for observation. proportion of apoptotic cells in 50% of the vision field were counted. Detection of serum insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) Prior to sacrificing the rabbits at the 8th week, 2 ml of blood was harvested from the central ear artery of each rabbit. the animal use protocol was reviewed and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of Soochow University. group A (n=15), the model group, was injected with 10 g/kg LPS (Escherichia coli serotype 0111:B4; 10 mg; Sigma-Aldrich; Merck Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) through the ear vein, and 20 mg/kg MPS (500 mg/bottle; H200 rabbits were placed in the supine position, with their lower leg flexed and fixed with tape. X-ray images showed spotty, thin-thread and patchy low or high signals. femoral head necrosis was determined according to pathological features of empty bone lacuna numbers. pathological changes in bone cellular necrosis were expressed as the percentage of empty bone lacunae out of 50 bone lacunae in each field were counted to calculate the percentage of empty bone lacunae. five fields were randomly selected under 400 magnification for observation, the proportion of apoptotic cells in 50% of the vision field were counted. three weeks after MPS was injected, 50% of the rabbits in group A exhibited reduced motor activity and significant weight loss. rabbits in group B exhibited normal motor activity without any significant changes in body weight. in group A, the bilateral femoral heads exhibited cystic degeneration, were irregular, and were mildly collapsed. in group B, the density of the femoral bone was uniformly increased, with visible or sclerotic bone. the subchondral bone plate of the femoral head and the bone trabeculae became thinner, the continuity was interrupted, more bone cellular nuclei exhibited karyopyknosis, and the nuclei were deeply stained. the changes in the subchondral bone marrow area included: large bone marrow fat tissues exhibited steatosis and dissolved. the empty bone lacuna rates of the femoral heads of each group are shown in Table I. group B exhibited moderate apoptosis, while group C exhibited minimal apoptotic bone cells. empty bone lacuna rate positively correlated with AI. coefficient r=0.74 (P0.01), regression equation =30.77+4.39x. -hip X-ray showed a normal femoral head with uniform bone density. bone density was uniformly increased without cystic degeneration or 'crescent sign' at the 8th week, the majority of femoral heads exhibited a normal appearance without collapse. hip magnetic resonance coronal scanning images of rabbits with necrosis of the femoral head. femoral heads exhibited thin thread-like low signals in the T1-weighted image. high signal in the gradient echo short time inversion recovery image. empty bone lacunae was 33.868.38%. the average rate of empty bone lacunae was 25.976.29%. the average rate of empty bone lacunae was 25.976.29%. apoptosis detection Specimens in group A exhibited the highest rate of apoptosis of the bone cells. group B exhibited moderate apoptosis, whereas group C exhibited minimal apoptotic bone cells. the differences were statistically significant (F=20.5558; P0.01) comparison between groups A and C exhibited no statistically significant difference (P=0.058) the serum IGF-1 content of group B was significantly higher than that of groups A and C (P0.01). in group A, the bilateral femoral heads exhibited cystic degeneration, were irregular, and were mildly collapsed. the bone trabeculae was partially disrupted. the joint space was normal. the subchondral bone plate of the femoral head and the bone trabeculae became thinner, the continuity was interrupted, more bone cellular nuclei exhibited karyopyknosis, and the nuclei were deeply stained. the changes in the subchondral bone marrow area included: large bone marrow fat tissues exhibited steatosis and dissolved; necrosis was aggravated. group A exhibited the highest rate of apoptosis of the bone cells. group B exhibited moderate apoptosis, while group C exhibited minimal apoptotic bone cells. the empty bone lacunae rate was positively correlated with AI. in group A, the empty bone lacunae rate was positively correlated with AI. patients with alcoholism-induced NFH showed less apoptotic cells. no apoptotic cells were detected in cases of NFH induced by apoptosis. glucocorticoids were recognized as one of factors that may contribute cellular apoptosis. the findings of the present study indicated that apoptotic bone cells were detected in the three groups, and the number of these apoptotic cells was significantly increased in group A compared with groups B and C. glucocorticoids may also affect the functions of osteoblasts, thus delaying bone formation and resulting in bone loss. receptors to increase the level of norepinephrine inside the hypothalamus would excite the -receptor and promote the release of growth hormone releasing factor. GH promotes the secretion of IGF-1 and other factors; IGF-1 is able to promote the synthesis of DNA and RNA in cartilage cells. the results of the present study showed that the animals in group B exhibited a more typically shaped femoral head with no collapse on dual-hip X-ray at the 8th week. the bone density was uniformly increased, which was distinct from the group A. rotic areas."}
