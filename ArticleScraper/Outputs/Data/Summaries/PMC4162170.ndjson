{"summary": "eukaryotes effectively eliminate these proteins via a series of conserved pathways called ER-associated degradation (ERAD) these pathways use multiple factors to recognize misfolded proteins and retrotranslocate them into the cytoplasm where they are ubiquitinated by the ubiquitin ligase Hrd1 and degraded by the proteasome. the mannosidase Htm1 modifies substrate glycans (8) to reveal a terminal 1,6-linked mannose that is subsequently recognized by the ER-resident lectin, Yos9 (3, 9\u201311). this signal glycan is subsequently recognized by the ER-resident lectin, Yos9. s9 has been proposed to have additional roles in which it retains misfolded proteins in the ER (19, 20) and facilitates degradation of nonglycosylated proteins (21). we hypothesize that Yos9 may contribute to the integration of both signals required for ERAD. Yos9(22\u2013421) was purified as described previously (3). the gel filtration was done in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. samples contained 0.05 mg/ml Yos9(22\u2013421) in 0.1 m sodium phosphate. the HA epitope (on CPY*) was detected using a 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) at 1:1000. the peptide array (W1007 B) was made by the MIT Biopolymers Laboratory. the arrays were processed according to a protocol described previously (24) with some modifications. changes in fluorescence anisotropy were measured on a Spectramax-M5 plate reader using a protocol described previously (24). Increasing concentrations of Yos9 were added to 50 nm FAM-labeled peptides in 20-l reactions. ANS-labeled 131 data sets, anisotropy (r) values were calculated from Equation 1, where [Yos9] is the concentration of Yos9; n is the Hill coefficient (assumed to be 1 for the case of Yos9 at low concentrations) the variables rfree and rbound were fixed to the anisotropy of the peptide alone and the maximum anisotropy observed in presence of Yos9. the laser is a 55-milliwatt laser and 826.6 nm; detection angle is 90\u00b0. samples were prepared in 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. the laser power was 100%. the mass of the predominant cleavage product was confirmed to be 45,401\u201345,403 Da. the mass of the predominant cleavage product was confirmed to be 45,401\u201345,403 Da. the gel filtration was done in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. the HA epitope (on CPY*) was detected using a 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) at 1:1000. a larger tiled array was used that included sequences from CPY*, mouse insulin, myelin protein zero, protein 8ab from SARS-CoV virus and peptides known to bind BiP. peptides were labeled with fluorophore fluorescein amidite (FAM). changes in fluorescence anisotropy were measured on a Spectramax-M5 plate reader. values are reported as an average of four readings. 131 was expressed beginning with a 20-ml overnight starter culture in LB that was spun down and resuspended in 1 liter of M9 minimal growth media. HSQC data of 131 in buffer (25 mm MES, 150 mm NaCl, pH 6) were acquired using a fast HSQC pulse sequence from Mark Kelly (University of California at San Francisco) 131 assignments were transferred from a previously published study. the laser is a 55-milliwatt laser and 826.6 nm; detection angle is 90\u00b0. samples were prepared in 10 mm Hepes, 100 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 10 mm MgCl2, pH 7.4. the mass of the predominant cleavage product was confirmed to be 45,401\u201345,403 Da. the mass of the predominant cleavage product was confirmed to be 45,401\u201345,403 Da. for comparison, Yos9(22\u2013421) is calculated to be 45,407 Da. the yJW1759 strain (yJW1759) was constructed via a URA3 intermediate. it retains both the endogenous promoter and terminator. the HA epitope (on CPY*) was detected using a 12CA5 monoclonal antibody. fluorescence anisotropy Synthetic peptides were purified to >90% purity. Increasing concentrations of Yos9 were added to 50 nm FAM-labeled peptides in 20-l reactions. IAEDANS-labeled 131 was donated by the Agard laboratory. values are reported as an average of four readings. m 131 was acquired followed by HSQC after serial additions of Yos9(22\u2013421) data were processed with NMRPipe (28) and peak height analysis was performed with the ccpn analysis software. the mass of the predominant cleavage product was confirmed to be 45,401\u201345,403 Da. for comparison, Yos9(22\u2013421) is calculated to be 45,407 Da. the gel filtration was done in 10 mm Hepes, 150 mm NaCl, pH 7.4. myces cerevisiae S288C strain with a genomic copy of either Yos9 (wild type) or Yos9(22\u2013421) strain (yJW1759) was constructed via a URA3 intermediate and retains both the endogenous promoter and terminator. the HA epitope was detected using a 12CA5 monoclonal antibody (Roche Applied Science) at 1:1000. fluorescence anisotropy Synthetic peptides were purified to >90% purity. the identities were confirmed by mass spectrometry. increasing concentrations of Yos9 were added to 1.25 m 131. values are reported as an average of four readings. 131 was donated by the Agard laboratory. an initial HSQC of 143 m 131 was acquired followed by HSQC after serial additions of Yos9(22\u2013421) data were processed with NMRPipe (28) and peak height analysis was performed with the ccpn analysis software. we identified a well defined 45-kDa fragment that corresponded to residues 22\u2013421 (Fig. 1, A and B) this fragment does not include the signal sequence or C-terminal residues that are part of a region predicted to be disordered by FoldIndex (31). recombinant Yos9(22\u2013421) also behaved similarly to the full-length protein. no consensus in literature regarding the oligomeric state of Yos9. previous work hypothesized that Yos9 exists as a trimer (3). this was based on its volume of elution from a size exclusion column. the authors confirmed this interaction via solution measurements in vitro. we quantified the observed binding pattern by averaging Yos9 binding intensities for each amino acid along the sequence of CPY*. we found that Yos9(22\u2013421) exhibited a binding signature highlighting four regions of enhanced affinity. this signature also appears to be specific as Ire1, the luminal sensor for the unfolded protein response (UPR) EspP is a 24-amino acid peptide derived from a signal sequence that is \u201cmoderately hydrophobic but unusually basic\u201d (32) the solubility imparted by the basic residues has made it useful for studying binding by both the signal recognition particle (32) and the UPR sensor Ire1 (24). 131 is a 131-residue fragment of staphylococcal nuclease (149 residues in full length) it is globally unfolded but compact (27, 29, 33) it is a 131-residue fragment of staphylococcal nuclease (149 residues in full length) as we added Yos9(22\u2013421), peaks on the 131 spectrum uniformly lost intensity. the simultaneous loss of peak intensity along the entire sequence of 131 is consistent with either multiple nonspecific contacts between Yos9(22\u2013421) and 131. the aggregation is highly cooperative, as we did not observe oligomers of intermediate sizes with a range of Yos9 and 131 concentrations. Yos9 also aggregated in the presence of EspP, which may explain the inability of EspP to compete EspP-FAM off of Yos9 in anisotropy experiments. we assessed the degree with which Yos9 and 131 form aggregates that can be cleared by centrifugation. the aggregates were composed of both proteins in all cases, but 131 was more abundant than Yos9 in the pelleted fraction. this was observed at concentrations as low as 1 m. in vitro, recombinant Yos9(22\u2013421) appeared folded by circular dichroism. recombinant Yos9(22\u2013421) behaved similarly to full-length protein. previous studies hypothesized that Yos9 exists as a trimer (3). we determined the molecular weight of both full-length and Yos9(22\u2013421) in solution using size exclusion chromatography multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) the weights were constant over a range of concentrations (8\u2013116 m), but it is possible that a low affinity dimer could dissociate within the SEC column producing the observed results. peptides rich in leucine, arginine, and lysine preferentially bind peptides rich in leucine, arginine, and lysine. the predilection for basic residues may be informative but should be interpreted with caution. the affinity of Yos9 for EspP-FAM was greater than that of BSA for the peptide (Kd = 3.53 1.25 m) the affinity of Yos9 for EspP-FAM was greater than that of BSA for the peptide (Kd = 3.53 1.25 m), and the latter interaction was weakened substantially by the addition of detergent. 131 is a 131-residue fragment of staphylococcal nuclease (149 residues in full length) it has been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy. due to its well dispersed HSQC spectrum, one can readily map regions of 131 that interact with binding partners. olar ratios are as follows: gray, 1:0; navy, 1:0.26; purple, 1:0.53; red, 1:0.78. peak height was calculated as a fraction of that for 131 alone. samples of Yos9(22\u2013421) and 131 alone or mixed were centrifuged and split into pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions. changes in solution conditions such as salt, pH, magnesium (which stabilizes 131), and calcium (which stabilizes some ER-resident proteins) did not impact aggregation. we also used available structural data for a portion of Yos9 to probe the effect of targeted mutations on aggregation. we identified a well defined 45-kDa fragment that corresponded to residues 22\u2013421 (Fig. 1, A and B) this fragment does not include the signal sequence or C-terminal residues that are part of a region predicted to be disordered by FoldIndex (31). this fragment does not include the signal sequence or C-terminal residues that are part of a region predicted to be disordered by FoldIndex (31). Yos9(22\u2013421) binds fluorescently labeled mannotriose with an affinity similar to that of the full-length protein. previously, there is no consensus in the literature regarding the oligomeric state of Yos9 (3, 30) previous work hypothesized that Yos9 exists as a trimer (3), but this was based on its volume of elution from a size exclusion column. we quantified the observed binding pattern by averaging Yos9 binding intensities for each amino acid along the sequence of CPY*. we found that Yos9(22\u2013421) exhibited a binding signature highlighting four regions of enhanced affinity. this signature appears to be specific as Ire1, the luminal sensor for the unfolded protein response (UPR) peptide EspP is a 24-amino acid peptide derived from a signal sequence that is \u201cmoderately hydrophobic but unusually basic\u201d (32) the solubility imparted by the basic residues has made it useful for studying binding by both the signal recognition particle (32) and the UPR sensor Ire1 (24). anisotropy of Yos9 titrated into 1.25 m IAEDANS-labeled 131. 131 is a 131-residue fragment of staphylococcal nuclease. it is globally unfolded but compact (27, 29, 33) HSQC spectra of 15N-131 with the addition of increasing amounts of Yos9(22\u2013421) peaks on the 131 spectrum uniformly lost intensity. the simultaneous loss of peak intensity along the entire sequence of 131 is consistent with either multiple nonspecific contacts. Yos9(22\u2013421), and 131 did not aggregate when alone in solution. but when mixed at or above concentrations of 1 m they reproducibly formed large aggregates. the aggregation is highly cooperative, as we did not observe oligomers of intermediate sizes with a range of Yos9 and 131 concentrations. we found that both aggregated in a manner indistinguishable from wild type Yos9. we assessed the degree with which Yos9 and 131 form aggregates that can be cleared by centrifugation. 131 was more abundant than Yos9 in pelleted fraction. recombinant Yos9(22\u2013421) appeared folded by circular dichroism in accordance with previous studies. previous work hypothesized that Yos9 exists as a trimer (3), but this was based on its volume of elution from a size exclusion column. we determined the molecular weight of both full-length and Yos9(22\u2013421) in solution using size exclusion chromatography multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) the molecular weights were constant over a range of concentrations (8\u2013116 m), but the low affinity dimer could dissociate within the SEC column producing the observed results. an analysis of the amino acid composition of the peptides bound suggested that Yos9 preferentially binds peptides rich in leucine, arginine, and lysine. the predilection for basic residues may be informative but should be interpreted with caution because the isoelectric point of Yos9 is 4.79. Yos9 bound EspP-FAM with an affinity of Kd = 0.94 0.26 m. the truncated version Yos9 also bound EspP-FAM. the affinity of Yos9 for EspP-FAM was greater than that of BSA for the peptide. 131 is a 131-residue fragment of staphylococcal nuclease (149 residues in full length) it is globally unfolded but compact (27, 29, 33), and its residual structure has been extensively characterized by NMR spectroscopy. the chaperone Hsp90 recognizes 131 via a single region (26) 131:Yos9(22\u2013421) molar ratios are as follows: gray, 1:0; navy, 1:0.26; purple, 1:0.53; red, 1:0.78. peak height was calculated as a fraction of that for 131 alone. samples of Yos9(22\u2013421) and 131 were centrifuged and split into pellet (P) and supernatant (S) fractions. changes in solution conditions such as salt, pH, magnesium (which stabilizes 131) and calcium (which stabilizes some ER-resident proteins) did not impact aggregation. we recombinantly expressed two Yos9 variants with mutations in conserved residues in either the dimer interface or the hydrophobic groove (Y318A/L329A/I377A) truncated variant characterized here may facilitate further structural studies that address all functions of Yos9 without potential issues incurred by conformational flexibility of the C terminus. truncated variant characterized here is compact, ordered, and fully functional in the degradation of CPY*. s9 preferentially binds sequences rich in hydrophobic and basic amino acids. but the role of basic residues may not be as readily apparent. the ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP (Kar2 in yeast) is known to bind regions rich in both basic and hydrophobic residues. the interaction of Yos9 with Hrd3 (13, 16, 38) may facilitate transfer of information from Yos9 to the Hrd1 complex. oligomerization plays a central role in the regulation of another key pathway involved in responding to misfolded proteins, the UPR."}
