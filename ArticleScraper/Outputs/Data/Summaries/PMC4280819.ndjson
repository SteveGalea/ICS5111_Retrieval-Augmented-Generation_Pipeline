{"summary": "the most natural ex vivo culture system was used to enable replication of respiratory viruses. the most natural ex vivo culture system was used to enable replication of respiratory viruses. the method relies on virus culturing combined with state-of-the-art sequencing techniques. in the 20th century, virus research and identification were limited to those agents that could be cultured in conventional cell lines. the downside is that without a virus culture, it is not possible to formally fulfill the Koch's postulates. in all three cases, the virus could be cultured, detected with the patient's own antibodies, and identified with VIDISCA-454. we propose immunostaining with convalescent serum collected from the same patient a few weeks after the respiratory infection. normal primary human bronchial epithelial cells (HBEpC) were isolated from patients (>18 years old) who underwent bronchoscopy and/or surgical lung resection in their diagnostic pathway for any pulmonary disease. this was carried out in accordance with local regulations from the Academic Medical Center, the Netherlands. medium was renewed every 2 or 3 days, and the apical surface was washed every 2 days. cultures were maintained at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 incubator. the apical and basolateral sides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by fixation with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; FormaFix) for 30 minutes at room temperature. confocal staining buffer (PBS supplemented with 50 mm NH4Cl, 01% saponin and 2% BSA (IgG-free) was added to both sides. virus harvests were centrifuged for 10 min at 10 000 g. rRNA-blocking oligonucleotides were added to prevent amplification of ribosomal RNA. reverse transcription reaction with Superscript II (Invitrogen) was performed. purified DNA was quantified with the Quant-it dsDNA HS Qubit kit (Invitrogen) and diluted to 107 copies/l. samples were pooled and Kapa PCR (Kapa Biosystems, Wilmington, MA, USA) was performed to determine the quantity of amplifiable DNA. sample S2705 was collected from a patient in Bialystock (Poland), I2125 from Lodz (Poland) and E1517 from Mataro (Spain) bronchial epithelial cells were isolated from patients who underwent bronchoscopy and/or surgical lung resection. a total of 8 104 cells were seeded on type IV collagen (Sigma)-coated 12-well ThinCerts with a 04-m pore size (Greiner Bio-One, Frickenhausen, Germany) medium was renewed every 7 days, and the apical surface was washed every 2 days with HBSS. apical and basolateral sides were rinsed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), followed by fixation with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; FormaFix) for 30 minutes at room temperature. confocal staining buffer (PBS supplemented with 50 mm NH4Cl, 01% saponin and 2% BSA) was added to both sides. cell washed with confocal staining buffer followed by incubation with Donkey-derived Dylight 488-labeled anti-mouse IgG(H+L) and Dylight 594-labeled anti-human IgG(H+L) for 1 hour at RT. cells are washed with confocal staining buffer and finally with PBS to remove saponin. Adaptors with different Multiplex Identifier sequences (MIDs) were ligated to the digested fragments. a 28-cycle PCR with adaptor-binding primers was performed. samples were pooled and Kapa PCR was performed. the contig sequences and the unassembled reads were compared with available sequences in Genbank via the BlastN tool using default settings. the blast output was used to create a taxonomic classification of the reads with Megan software version 4.70.4. three respiratory samples were used to inoculate human airway epithelial (HAE) cells. the cells were fixed 96 or 120 hours post-inoculation with 4% PFA. the difference in intensity of tubulin staining represents experimental variation in differentiation (S2705 versus E1517). sequence reads in respiratory samples upon human airway epithelial culturing Sample name Total number of sequence reads Reads of viral origin (%) Virus identified Genome coverage (%) S2705 3227 108% HCoV-OC43 516% I2125 2686 132% Inf-A (H3N2) 575% E1517 3211 885% Inf-B 818% Influenzavirus B replication The replication characteristics are noteworthy. cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody against a ciliated cell-specific marker (\u00df-tubulin IV) to identify ciliated cells. for all three cultures, infected cells could be visualized by confocal microscopy. each sample contained a different respiratory virus: human coronavirus OC43 (sample S2705), influenzavirus A H3N2 (sample I2125) or influenzavirus B (sample E1517) the number of reads was substantial for each virus (in all cases more than 10% of the total reads) the discovery of a novel human virus should preferably be accompanied by serology. ideally a virus culture system as the first requirement in fulfilling the Koch's postulates. three clinical samples were used to evaluate the combined culture-virus-discovery tool. the sequence reads provide a high genome coverage. advanced intestinal epithelial culture systems have been developed. this could be combined with staining and virus discovery to identify only those viruses that infect human cells in the intestine. a false-positive staining cannot result in a false-positive virus identification or discovery. the method may not work if the staining with convalescent serum yields no signal. the only response to an infection occurs in the mucosa via IgA. the population yet have not been discovered. this was the case for rhinovirus C, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-NL63, human bocavirus, etc."}
