{"summary": "the chicken MHC has allowed the discovery and/or study of phenomena that have been more difficult to discern in the complex MHC biology of humans and other typical mammals. the human MHC does have many strong genetic associations with autoimmune disease, but the reported associations with infectious disease are much weaker 2, 12. a long list of viruses, bacteria, and even parasites have significant associations with the BF-BL region 4, 5, 17, 18. the BF-BL region of chickens (also called the \u2018classical MHC\u2019 or the \u2018core MHC\u2019) is compact, simple, and arranged differently. the monomorphic DR-like class II A gene (BLA) is located some 5 cM away [29]. polymorphic classical class I and class II B genes are in strong linkage disequilibrium with polymorphic peptide-loading genes. the BF1 gene has suffered deletions and insertions leading to far less expression at the RNA and protein levels than the BF2 gene 36, 37. the dominantly expressed BF2 molecule can explain the immune response to certain economically important viruses and vaccines. the antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes are located in the class II and extended class II regions, far from the class I genes that they serve. however, alleles of antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes that were advantageous for any particular class I allele would relatively rapidly be switched by recombination. compared with mammals, the major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) of chickens has strong genetic associations with resistance to infectious disease. a multigene family in the human MHC can encode multiple fastidious class I molecules each of which has a chance to find a protective peptide. comparison of a fastidious allele with a promiscuous allele in chickens may give strong genetic associations. xenopus frogs have a single classical class I gene along with the TAP (apparently at least oligomorphic) and tapasin genes located together, with this region having a strong genetic association with resistance to at least one economically important virus 50, 51. the organization originally discovered for chickens is likely to be the ancestral one. a genomic inversion can lead to the class III region moving between the single dominantly expressed class I gene and the rest of the MHC. the close linkage within the class I region leads to a single dominantly expressed class I gene (red) whose peptide motif reflects the specificities of the polymorphic antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes. antigen-processing and peptide-loading genes are selected to support any class I allele that might appear due to recombination. this would then allow duplication within an MHC haplotype to give a multigene family encoding class I molecules with different peptide motifs (red, green, blue), as is found in typical mammals. BF2 molecules from resistant haplotypes can bind an exceedingly large variety of peptides and might be called promiscuous. the molecule BF2*21:01 remodels the binding site to accommodate three anchor residues, at peptide positions P2, Pc-2, and Pc. peptide repertoire with resistance to Marek\u2019s disease was unexpected. inverse correlation of peptide repertoire with cell-surface expression was unexpected. inverse correlation of peptide repertoire with cell-surface expression was unexpected. inverse correlation of peptide repertoire with cell-surface expression was unexpected. peptide binding for 27 HLA-A and HLA-B alleles was shown to vary inversely with peptide repertoire. assays with transfected cDNA clones for 27 HLA-B alleles showed a wide range of peptide repertoires. peptide repertoire, lower cell-surface expression level, longer TAP binding, and faster HIV progression for HLA-A and HLA-B alleles seem to be broadly (but not perfectly) correlated the highly promiscuous chicken class I molecule BF2*04:01 requires the binding of relatively rare acidic amino acids in each of three pockets 37, 56, 66. the presence of a multigene family of human class I molecules means that the selective pressure for extremely promiscuous and fastidious molecules is lower than in chickens. several features of the HLA-C gene contribute in a complex way to cell-surface expression. the differences include: promoter sequence and transcription; miRNA sites in the 3\u2032 UTR sequences and RNA stability; 2m association, peptide motif, and peptide repertoire; and TAP residency and translocation to the surface 67, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76. promiscuous BF2 alleles protect chickens against a range of common infectious diseases. the fastidious human class I alleles HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*27:05 confer protection against the dangerous zoonotic pathogen HIV. low-expression promiscuous class I alleles function as generalists. high-expression fastidious alleles act as specialists 57, 63. one evolutionary hypothesis would be that low-expression promiscuous class I alleles function as generalists while high-expression fastidious alleles act as specialists. color indicates fastidious molecules encoded by genes that arise by mutation. one of the generalist molecules confers protection against the first pathogen. one of the specialist molecules confers protection against the second pathogen. another of the specialist molecules confers protection against the third pathogen. us peptide motifs similar to HLA-B*57:01 and HLA-B*27:05. a promiscuous molecule may be able to protect against a new and virulent pathogen. a potential advantage might arise from bundling together alleles that are promiscuous or fastidious, allowing greater statistical power in genetic association studies. the chicken MHC again has provided a simple model to discover phenomena that have been difficult to discern in both the more complicated MHC of typical mammals and the less well-characterized MHC of wild species. if this is not the case for human HLA-C, why? these studies should be easier in mice and primates where a significant literature is available but are largely relevant across the animal kingdom (e.g., farm and sport animals, farmed fish)."}
