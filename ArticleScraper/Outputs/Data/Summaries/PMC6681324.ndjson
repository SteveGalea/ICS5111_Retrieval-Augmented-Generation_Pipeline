{"summary": "traditional and complementary medicine (T&CM) can be defined as a set of healthcare modalities (local or imported products and practices) that are historically located outside the dominant model of healthcare [1,2]. in africa, T&CM may include traditional healthcare products and practices (herbal medicine or products and traditional bone setting) and imported complementary medicine (acupuncture and massage therapy, yoga naturopathy) two dominant sets of interpretations have been proposed to explain the reasons why many people around the globe use T&CM. the first set of interpretations can loosely be referred to as pull factors, which focused on those features, and factors around T&CM that are attractive to users (pull factors) the second interpretation relates to people who are dissatisfied with what conventional medicine can offer (push factors) studies may also serve to identify \u2018push\u2019 and \u2018pull\u2019 factors that can help design more responsive health services for Ebola survivors. to fill this significant research gap, our study evaluates Ebola survivors\u2019 attitudes towards the use of T&CM in Sierra Leone. the required sample of 351 Ebola survivors was determined using the formula for cross-sectional study (N = z2pq/d2) the perceived prevalence (p) assumed to be 50% since no previous research on T&CM use among Ebola survivors has been conducted so far. a sample of Ebola survivors was approached to take part in the study via telephone. initial verbal consent was obtained via telephone. a participant information sheet that explains the purpose and scope of the study was given or read (for illiterate participants) participants signed or thumbprint the consent form. 2.6. Statistical Analysis Data analysis was conducted using SPSS Statistics version 24. we used a backward stepwise binary logistic model to determine the attitude statements that are significant predictors of T&CM use. all attitude statements were entered into the model, and a backward stepwise elimination process was conducted until we obtained the most parsimonious model. these five districts are based on the epidemiological profile of the total confirmed Ebola cases and because they are host to the highest number of Ebola survivors in Sierra Leone. Survivors who were randomly selected were approached to participate in the study via telephone. the required sample of 351 Ebola survivors was determined using the formula for cross-sectional study (N = z2pq/d2) a sample of survivors was approached to take part in the study via telephone. initial verbal consent was obtained via telephone. a participant information sheet was given or read (for illiterate participants) participants before asked to sign or thumbprint the consent form. some Ebola survivors filled the questionnaire in the presence of a data collector or were interviewed by a data collector at the Ebola survivor regional office. some Ebola survivors filled the questionnaire alone in their homes at their own time and later sent the filled questionnaires to their regional offices. n (%) Age Group 18\u201333 years 194 (54.2) 34\u201349 years 134 (37.4) 50 years 30 (8.4) Sex Male 135 (37.7) female 223 (62.3) Educational Status Non-formal education 147 (41.1) Primary 44 (12.3) Secondary 126 (35.2) Tertiary 41 (11.5) Religious Affiliation Christianity 92 (25.7) Islam 266 (74.3) Marital Status Single 100 (27.9) Married/Cohabitating 171 more than two thirds of participants (n = 257, 71.8%) believe that T&CM is \u2018natural\u2019. more than half (n = 218, 60.9%) did not perceive T&CM as having fewer side effects. my immune system/resistance 114 (31.8) 44 (12.3) 200 (55.9) T&CM has fewer side-effects than conventional medicine 82 (22.9) 58 (16.2) 218 (60.9) T&CM promotes a holistic approach to health 100 (27.9) 55 (15.4) 203 (56.7) T&CM gives me more control over my health/body 120 (33.5) 78 (21.8) 160 (44.7) Knowledge about the evidence of T&CM is important to me as T&CM has fewer side-effects than conventional medicine (p 0.001) are associated with T&CM use. no statistical difference was observed between T&CM users and non-users. 71 (36.4) my personal experience of the effectiveness of T&CM is more important than clinical evidence Disagree 19 (11.7) 140 (71.8) 0.001 Neutral 11 (6.7) 25 (12.8) Agree 133 (81.6) 30 (15.4) T&CM is a better preventative measure than conventional medicine Disagree 87 (53.4) 163 (83.6) 0.001 Neutral 24 (14.7) 26 (13.3) Agree 52 (31.9) 6 (3.1) T&CM needs survivors who agreed with the statement that T&CM has fewer side effects than CM were 5.03 (95%CI: 1.92\u201313.19, p = 0.001) times more likely to use T&CM than those who disagreed. survivors who believe that T&CM gives them more control over their health/body were 4.15 (95%CI: 1.74\u20139.89, p = 0.001) times more likely to be T&CM users. the appeal of T&CM to boosting immunity among users may be explained in that, an individual\u2019s health is a function of his/her immune status. this is in line with T&CM philosophies that disease should be managed by challenging the body to heal itself rather than focusing on symptomatic treatment. the assumption that T&CM treatments are natural and therefore non-toxic has been found to be associated with people\u2019s decisions to use T&CM in multiple studies in multiple conditions. some T&CM products and practices are considered natural and organic as opposed to conventional medicine, which is often thought of as artificial and/or synthetic. the safety of T&CM in general is still a debatable area. clinical research examining the safety and efficacy of commonly used T&CM in Sierra Leone is lacking. it is imperative that robust efficacy and safety studies are conducted on commonly used T&CM in Sierra Leone that will inform personal and clinical decision making. the sense of fear, vulnerability and perceived loss of control over their health may be a source of attraction toward T&CM. the majority of users and non-users amongst the Ebola survivors agreed that medical doctors should be able to advise their patients about T&CM. the expectation of Ebola survivors for conventional medicine practitioners to be able to provide advice on T&CM illustrates a potential need for healthcare providers to routinely initiate and incorporate discussions about T&CM. findings are not necessarily representative of perceptions and experiences of Ebola survivors in other countries. we excluded Ebola survivors with conditions that limit their ability to accurately provide information or participate in the study."}
