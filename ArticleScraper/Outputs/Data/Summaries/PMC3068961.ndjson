{"summary": "a small number developed a more severe clinical syndrome. for most infected individuals, symptoms were mild and self-limited. but a small number developed a more severe clinical syndrome. hospital mortality ranging from 10 to 30%. trial registration number ISRCTN45190901 Background Influenza and Swine Origin Influenza A/H1N1 Infection (H1N1) On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared that infection with the Swine Origin Influenza A/H1N1 virus had reached pandemic proportions. seasonal influenza is responsible for more than 50,000 deaths per year in the united states. a small percentage of infected individuals developed profound respiratory failure. there is little excess capacity to care for critically ill patients in most developed countries, and minimal capacity in developing countries. statins are associated with reduced inflammatory morbidity in critically ill patients receiving them [20] and reduced mortality in patients with influenza and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients with multiple organ dysfunction syndrome. statin use is independently associated with a reduced risk of death. rosuvastatin differs from other HMG CoA reductase inhibitors. a dose-related increase in liver transaminases and creatinine kinase (CK) has been observed in small numbers of patients taking rosuvastatin. the 1918 pandemic was the largest in recent history and caused between 40 and 50 million deaths worldwide. experts believe further pandemics will certainly occur, but are uncertain about when. there is little excess capacity to care for critically ill patients in most developed countries. there is little excess capacity to care for critically ill patients. there is little excess capacity to care for critically ill patients in most developed countries. pre-treatment with statins attenuates the severity of acute lung injury (ALI) following intestinal ischemia-reperfusion [27] and the inflammatory response to intravenous lipopolysaccharide challenge in human volunteers [28]. statins are associated with reduced inflammatory morbidity in critically ill patients receiving them [20] and reduced mortality in patients with influenza and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) patients. a dose-related increase in liver transaminases and creatinine kinase (CK) has been observed in small numbers of patients taking rosuvastatin. the overall occurrence of clinically significant transaminase increases is low ( 1%) and similar across rosuvastatin doses ranging from 5 mg/day to 40 mg/day. ence to the medication administration regimen outlined in the study protocol. the number of patients who receive open-label statins. the number of consent withdrawals. d. CK exceeds 5,000 U/L or ALT exceeds 8 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). d. CK exceeds 5,000 U/L or ALT exceeds 8 times the upper limit of normal (ULN). d. severe chronic liver disease (Child-Pugh Score 11-15) consent algorithm will direct the consent process at sites where the local REB has not approved a waiver of consent. in this trial, we will request that patients be enrolled in the study, and consent be deferred to the patient. in the event that patients die before providing consent, we request permission from REBs to include data collected during study participation. first study drug dose (rosuvastatin or placebo) will be administered within 4 hours of randomization as a loading dose of 40 mg unless subject is of Asian descent, age 18 years or has serum creatinine greater than or equal to 248 umol/L (2.8 mg/dL) subsequent doses of 20 mg will be administered at 22:00 hrs daily (+/- 4 hours) starting on the next calendar day (study day 2) as a maintenance dose. 2.8 mg/dL are not on renal replacement therapy (loading 20 mg and daily 10 mg), and by 75% for patients: d) who have at least one parent of Asian descent and/or age 18 years. serum creatinine is greater than or equal to 248 umol/L (loading 10 mg and daily 5 mg) sporine, gemfibrozil, lopinavir, ritonavir, oral contraceptives or estrogen 7. attending physician or intensivist or SDM request to stop treatment. decision regarding continuation or discontinuation of antiviral treatment will be left to the discretion of the attending physician or intensivist. nasopharyngeal (NP) swab AND either an endotracheal (ET) aspirate or bronchoalveolar (BAL) for gram stain, culture and sensitivity (C & S) Repeat tests (PCR and viral culture) from the site that was positive previously (i.e., ET or BAL or NP swab) send repeat ET aspirate specimen at day 7 and at weekly intervals thereafter. study drug will be discontinued if hypersensitivity is suspected. the study data safety and monitoring board will review all patients withdrawn from the study, safety data, and deaths. at day 60 patients remaining on the ventilator will be deemed ventilator dependent. the forms will document baseline characteristics, enrolment into concurrent influenza research studies, co-morbidities, illness severity. the forms will document baseline characteristics, enrolment into concurrent influenza research studies, co-morbidities, illness severity (see Additional File 4), vaccination status, co-interventions, feasibility outcomes and clinical outcomes. all analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. feasibility data from the pilot study will be analyzed by the DSMB at the end of the study. clinical outcomes will remain blinded by study group assignment with a view to include them in the planned larger trial. if clinically important and unexpected adverse experiences occur, they will be recorded on an adverse event case report form. the ability to recruit the desired patient population under pandemic conditions (i.e., the proportion of eligible patients enrolled in the CHAT Pilot Trial) the ability to collect the required primary and secondary endpoints for the planned full CHAT trial. receiving niacin, fenofibrate, cyclosporine, gemfibrozil, any protease inhibitor (including but not limited to lopinavir and ritonavir) or planned use of oral contraceptives or estrogen therapy during the ICU stay. eligible patients will be randomized centrally to the research pharmacies of participating centres. a waiver of consent is preferred option for participant enrollment given the context of a global pandemic. in this trial, we will request that patients be enrolled in the study, and consent be deferred to SDMs or to the patient. the ability to safely take oral medications will be determined by the patient's primary care team. the first study drug dose (rosuvastatin or placebo) will be administered within 4 hours of randomization as a loading dose of 40 mg unless the subject is of Asian descent, age 18 years or has serum creatinine greater than or equal to 248 umol/L (2.8 mg/dL) serum creatinine is greater than or equal to 248 umol/L (2.8 mg/dL) who are not on renal replacement therapy (loading 20 mg and daily 10 mg), and by 75% for patients. if patients are liberated from mechanical ventilation they will be advanced to day 10 of study drug administration. subsequent doses of 20 mg will be administered at 22:00 hrs daily (+/- 4 hours) starting on the next calendar day (study day 2) as a maintenance dose. if the patient is of Asian descent, is 18 years, or serum creatinine is greater than or equal to 248 umol/L (2.8 mg/dL) dose adjustments will be required according to the dose adjustment algorithm. if patients are liberated from mechanical ventilation they will be advanced to day 10 of study drug administration. if patients remain in the ICU for observation then study drug administration will NOT be advanced to day 10 until they are discharged. clinicians will be encouraged to continue study medication despite negative H1N1 testing due to the potential for false negative results. decisions regarding continuation or discontinuation of antiviral treatment will be left to the discretion of the attending physician or intensivist. aspirate or bronchoalveolar (BAL) (or sputum if not intubated) for (a) influenza polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and (b) viral culture; and 2. Endotracheal aspirate (or sputum if not intubated) for gram stain, culture and sensitivity (C & S) Repeat testing (for patients with one positive test) to verify adequate absorption of rosuvastatin, we will draw venous blood for peak and trough plasma rosuvastatin concentrations on day 7 (+/- 1 day) trough level specimen will be drawn prior to day 7 (+/- 1 day) dose. peak concentration specimen will be drawn 3 to 5 hours after dose of study drug is administered. d from the ICU and requiring readmission and re-initiation of mechanical ventilation (invasive or non-invasive) will be treated according to usual practice and will not be randomized on a second occasion to this study. data forms developed for the Influenza A H1N1 (Swine Flu) ICU study. we developed 13 additional forms including an (i) eligibility and randomization form, (ii) severity of illness form, (iii) consent form, (iv) drug level (serum) specimen collection form, (viii) 60 day and 90 day outcomes form, (ix) comments and end of study investigator sign off, (xii) serious adverse event form. less than 10% of medication doses will fail to be administered in the absence of meeting one of the medication discontinuation criteria. no more than 10% of enrolled patients will be withdrawn prematurely due to open label use of statins or withdrawal of consent. if clinically important and unexpected adverse experiences occur, they will be recorded on an adverse event case report form. despite the potential virulence of the illness, little is known about how severe disease develops or what treatments may confer benefit to critically ill patients. the burden of severe H1N1 disease falls prominently on the ICU [8,38] rosuvastatin is attractive as adjuvant treatments amidst emerging reports of oseltamivir resistance and threatened drug supply shortages. the ability to administer and test the efficacy of an adjuvant agent remains to be established. the pilot trial is designed to evaluate the feasibility of implementing a randomized controlled trial of adjuvant rosuvastatin. the conduct of an RCT during an evolving pandemic poses unique challenges not encountered during other forms of clinical research. the scope and duration of the pandemic is unknown and unpredictable. the practicalities of conducting clinical research during a pandemic are unknown. authors' contributions All authors contributed to conception and design of the CHAT Pilot Trial. drafted and revised the manuscript for important intellectual content. the CHAT Pilot Trial is funded with grants from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Physician Services Incorporated Foundation, and the Public Health Agency of Canada. the funding sources had no role in the study design, data collection, analysis, interpretation or manuscript preparation."}
