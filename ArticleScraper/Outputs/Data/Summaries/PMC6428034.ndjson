{"summary": "bats have high metabolic rate during flight and low metabolic rate in the day during their shallow torpor. this has been thought to play a role in their ability to cope with infections. study of the bat immune system has been hampered by lack of tools and resources available. innate immunity in bats has been studied in several species mostly at genome and transcriptome levels. common innate immune defense mechanisms are found in bats such as toll-like receptors (15, 16) common innate immune defense mechanisms are found in bats such as toll-like receptors (TLRs) transcripts of IgM, IgE, IgA, and several IgG subclasses were also detected. IgG antibodies were found in abundance in maternal lacteal secretions. presence of IgD in some microbats but not in megabats also reported. foxide (DMSO) and 90% fetal bovine serum (FBS) were frozen overnight at 80\u00b0C in a sandwich box. only bats testing negative by qPCR for Hendra virus (HeV) and lyssavirus were included in the study. mouse I-A/I-E MHC class II (clone 2G9, BD), anti-mouse CD21 (clone M1/70, eBioscience), anti-human CD21 (clone B-ly-4, eBioscience), anti-mouse CD27 (clone LG.7F9, eBioscience), and anti-mouse NK1.1 (clone PK136, Biolegend) each antibody was titrated to cells were incubated with a live fixable viability dye (eBioscience), then fixed and permeabilized according to manufacturer's instructions. analysis was done using a calcium sensor dye, Indo-1 AM (eBioscience, USA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C + 5% CO2. cells were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (25, 50, 75, 95, and 100%) followed by critical point drying with CO2. t-test was performed on the control, LPS treated and Poly I:C treated bat groups and on B, T and myeloid cell subsets. only bats testing negative by qPCR for Hendra virus (HeV) and lyssavirus were included in the study. the procedures performed on P. alecto bats were approved by the Queensland Animal Science Precinct. anti-mouse CD27 (clone LG.7F9, eBioscience), and anti-mouse NK1.1 (clone PK136, Biolegend) incubation with non-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-bat Ig (Novus Biologicals, NB7237) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C followed by incubation with fluorescently labeled anti-goat IgG secondary antibody (ThermoFisher) Fluor 647-labeled CD19 mRNA oligo probes (1 M final concentration for each oligo) analysis was done using a calcium sensor dye, Indo-1 AM (eBioscience, USA) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C + 5% CO2. unbound Indo-1 has a peak emission at 475 nm. cells were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanol (25, 50, 75, 95, and 100%) followed by critical point drying with CO2. Dried specimens were sputter coated with gold, with a BALTEC SCD005 evaporator. single, live cells from the leukocyte population were gated and analyzed by flow cytometry. some of these antibodies (e.g., CD4 RM44) were excluded due to non-specific binding. some of these antibodies (e.g., CD4 RM44) were excluded due to non-specific binding. anti-Mouse CD3 21.70 15.60 Anti-Human MHC-II (I-A/I-E) 23.50 66.30 Anti-Mouse The limited number of true cross-reactive antibodies that were identified in this study further supports our previous findings that surface markers of adaptive immune cells are not well conserved. spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were analyzed by flow cytometry. spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were identified as T cells. spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were identified as T cells. greater than 85% of this population is MHCII+. comparable percentages of these cells were obtained with surface staining only vs. intracellular staining only. this suggests that this population is truly a sIg+ B cell population. P. alecto's spleen contains greater percentages of T cells and lower percentages of B cells compared to human PBMC. the reverse is seen in bat PBMC, which typically consist of about 3\u201315% B cells and 40\u201360% T cells. group of three wild-caught P. alecto bats were injected subcutaneously with LPS, poly I:C or left untreated. their bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes (LN) and PBMC were harvested. single cells suspensions were prepared and subjected to flow cytometry analysis using the selected cross-reactive antibody panel. the bone marrow (BM), spleen (SPL), blood (PBMC) and lymph nodes (LN) were harvested 5 h after sc. injection with either LPS or Poly I:C, and analyzed by flow cytometry. three distinct populations were clearly obtained based on CD11b and MHC-II staining. single cell suspensions prepared from BM, spleen (SPL), PBMC and lymph nodes were incubated with a calcium sensor dye, Indo-1 which has a peak emission at 475 nm that shifts to 410 nm when bound to calcium. a calcium release assay was conducted to further assess the functionality of bat B cells. the strongest signals were detected with B cells from SPL and LN. this observation may be explained by the fact that these lymphoid organs harbor a greater proportion of mature B cells compared to the bone marrow. cross-reactive antibody panel was applied on E. spelaea bone marrow and spleen samples. this finding implies a certain sequence conservation of adaptive immune cell surface markers amongst bat species. less than 10% of NK cells in the bone marrow and spleen of E. spelaea were indeed seen in the spleens from E. spelaea, vs. 10\u201316% in P. alecto bats. discrepancies may be attributed either to inherent differences in the immune system between E. spelaea and P. alecto bats. the choice of these 83 antibodies was based on their ability to identify B cells, either directly through binding to B cell surface markers or indirectly through binding to non-B cells. single, live cells from the leukocyte population were gated and analyzed by flow cytometry. some of these antibodies (e.g., CD4 RM44) were excluded due to non-specific binding. anti-Mouse Ig 37.80 39.40

cross-reactive antibodies that were identified in this study further supports our previous findings that surface markers of Flow cytometry analysis of P. alecto immune cells using cross-reactive antibodies and Flow-FISH. spleen, bone marrow and peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) were identified as T cells. greater than 85% of this population is MHCII+. comparable percentages of these cells were obtained with surface staining only vs. intracellular staining only. the percentages of NK cells in the four bats ranged between 10 and 16% in spleen and between 5 and 11% in bone marrow. compared to mice that harbor 30\u201335% T cells and 45\u201350% B cells in their spleen, P. alecto's spleen contains greater percentages of T cells. groups of three wild-caught P. alecto bats were injected subcutaneously with LPS, poly I:C (a TLR3 agonist with no known B cell activation properties) or left untreated. all nine animals were sacrificed 5 h later. their bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes (LN) and PBMC were harvested. cells from the bone marrow (BM), spleen (SPL), blood (PBMC) and lymph nodes (LN) were harvested 5 h after sc. injection with either LPS or Poly I:C. lymphocytes were gated based on forward and side scatter distribution. increase in bat B cell population could be observed as early as 5 h post-LPS treatment, while LPS-induced murine B cell proliferation is observed after several days of stimulation. a calcium release assay was conducted to further assess the functionality of bat B cells. the strongest signals were detected with B cells from SPL and LN. this latter observation may be explained by fact that these lymphoid organs harbor a greater proportion of mature B cells compared to the bone marrow. cross-reactive antibody panel was applied on E. spelaea bone marrow and spleen samples. the antibody panel can be used for flow cytometry analysis of adaptive immune cell populations in different bat species. the percentages of NK cells in the bone marrow and spleen of E. spelaea were rather different from those seen in P. alecto bats. these differences may be attributed either to inherent differences in the immune system between E. spelaea and P. alecto bats. a panel of cross-reactive antibodies contributes significantly to the limited toolbox currently available to study bats adaptive immune system (34) the limited cross-reactivity observed in this study suggests that the adaptive immune cells in bats have diverged from other mammals such as humans and mice. identifying cross-reactive antibodies allows for much quicker and cost-effective ways of studying bat immune cell populations. the percentage of T cells in the spleen was about 10%, which is significantly 30% we previously reported. the differences may stem from a different immune status between the two batches of wild caught bats, which were obtained from two different trips at different time of the year. the predominance of T cells in bats does however not exclude a role for B cells. our work suggests that bat B cells are functional and are capable of responding to LPS stimulation. however, the predominance of T cells in bats does not exclude a role for B cells. author contributions PP: designed experiments; PP, PH, JC, IB, SS, PS, and YH: performed experiments; AI, MB, and GC: provided materials; PP, JC, and SA: performed data analysis; C-AD, KF,
