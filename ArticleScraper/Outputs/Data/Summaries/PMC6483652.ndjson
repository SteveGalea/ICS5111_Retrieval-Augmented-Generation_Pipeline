{"summary": "the introduction Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreaks have been reported in more than 50 countries and territories since 2015. more than 3,000 confirmed infections in fetuses have been reported. the virus can transmit via mosquito vectors, sexual contact, and blood transfusion. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRA) is an endogenous molecule present in amniotic fluid and cord blood. IRA circulates systemically at higher levels in pregnant compared with nonpregnant women (22) treatment during pregnancy with exogenous IRA can protect against placental and neurodevelopmental defects induced by in utero inflammation. immunocompetent dams were infected in utero with ZIKV to systematically evaluate the impact of ZIKV on the placental inflammatory responses. IRA treatment inhibits microglial activation in the perinatal brain both directly and indirectly. pregnant CD-1 mice received an intrauterine injection of 106 TCID50 units of the 2015 Brazil, 2015 Puerto Rico (PR), or 1968 Nigeria ZIKV, or vehicle (mock) at E10, pregnant CD-1 mice received an intrauterine injection of 106 TCID50 units of the 2015 Brazil, 2015 Puerto Rico (PR), or 1968 Nigeria ZIKV. infection with diverse strains of ZIKV significantly reduced fetal viability 48 hpi. placental ZIKV RNA copies, however, did not correlate with fetal survival. a subset of dams was allowed to carry to term. the mRNA expression of 96 immune-related genes was upregulated in the placenta 6 hours after in utero ZIKV inoculation. at 6 hpi, the concentration of IL-1 was also significantly increased in placentas as compared with placentas from mock-inoculated dams. placentas were collected 6 hours after inoculation (6 hpi; ZIKV: n = 4) mRNA expression of proinflammatory cytokines was quantified. pregnant dams were treated daily with either an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IRA) or PBS until tissue harvesting. the ZIKV-induced reduction in fetal viability was reversed by coadministration of IRA. maternal IRA administration preserves placental development during intrauterine ZIKV infection. IRA administration during ZIKV infection significantly improved the migration of trophoblasts into the mesometrial triangle. IL-1 receptor antagonism during intrauterine ZIKV infection improves trophoblast invasion and vascular remodeling. pregnant dams were treated daily with either an IRA or PBS. IRA administration to ZIKV-infected dams reversed behavioral abnormalities in pups. IL-1 receptor antagonism during intrauterine ZIKV infection reverses behavioral abnormalities and neuroinflammation in the pups. IHC for Iba-1, a marker of microglia, was used to assess neuroinflammation in the brains of pups at P5. IRA treatment reduced neonatal neuroinflammation as well as placental inflammation. IRA treatment reduced neonatal neuroinflammation as well as placental inflammation. treatment of ZIKV-infected cultures with IRA at all concentrations reversed this phenotype. IRA treatment can directly reduce neuroinflammation. primary microglial cell cultures were generated from brain tissues collected from neonatal mice at P5. trophoblast invasion into the mesometrial triangle (P 0.05, 1-way ANOVA, Figure 1, B and C) decreased vimentin expression in placental villi (P 0.05, 1-way ANOVA, Figure 1, D and E) at E10, pregnant CD-1 mice received an intrauterine injection of 106 TCID50 units of the 2015 Brazil, 2015 Puerto Rico (PR), or 1968 Nigeria ZIKV, or vehicle (mock) infection with diverse strains of ZIKV significantly reduced fetal viability 48 hpi. placental ZIKV RNA copies did not correlate with fetal survival. developmental abnormalities were quantified in pups through postnatal day P8. mRNA expression of 96 immune-related genes was upregulated in the placenta 6 hours after in utero ZIKV inoculation. IL-1 concentration was significantly increased in placentas as compared with placentas from mock-inoculated dams. dams were inoculated with inactivated ZIKV and placentas were collected 6 hpi. in utero exposure to ZIKV increases placental IL-1. blocking IL-1 receptor signaling with IRA increased ZIKV copies in placenta. fetal viability was significantly reduced in ZIKV- compared with mock-inoculated dams 48 hpi. viability of fetuses from IRA-treated ZIKV-infected dams significantly improved. ZIKV infection reduced the appearance of trophoblasts in the spiral arteries. treatment of ZIKV-infected dams with IRA increased the amount of trophoblast cell invasion into the decidual spiral arteries. placental vascularity, as measured by the density of vimentin staining, was increased by IRA administration to ZIKV-infected dams. maternal IRA administration mitigates the behavioral consequences of ZIKV and inhibits microglial expression in neonatal brains. neurological behavioral tests were performed at P5 and P9. IHC was performed to quantify the concentration of microglia (a measure of neuroinflammation) in the hippocampus of pups from ZIKV- compared with mock-inoculated dams (C). neuroinflammation can contribute to neurocognitive deficits in neonatal mice (42\u201344) more than 90% of microglia were infected with ZIKV 24 hpi. quantification of ZIKV RNA copies revealed no effect of IRA on total viral burden. the contribution of placental immune responses to ZIKV has been ignored. the maternal inflammatory response represents an environmental factor that is known to increase the risk for childhood and developmental diseases. IL-1 receptor blockade with IRA decreases activation of neuronal NOS (nNOS), cortical neuronal cell death, and perinatal brain injury. intraperitoneal injections of murine recombinant IL-1 (rIL-1) during gestation result in neurologic sequelae (62), consistent with ZIKV. essential to the development of the placenta is sufficient invasion of trophoblasts. ZIKV can infect many cell types in the placenta and fetus. fetal microglia, endothelial cells, and neural progenitor cells. inflammatory responses, including IL-1 secretion, are involved in placental dysregulation. despite a lack of replicating virus in the neonatal brain, neurologic abnormalities are observed into adolescence. microglia are a target for ZIKV (13, 82) and express the IL-1 receptor (83). in vitro, IRA treatment improved the proliferation of primary microglia exposed to ZIKV in utero. future studies must examine inflammatory immune responses during pregnancy. IRA provides opportunities for clinical translation in the treatment of congenital Zika syndrome and other fetal developmental sequelae associated with infections during pregnancy.
