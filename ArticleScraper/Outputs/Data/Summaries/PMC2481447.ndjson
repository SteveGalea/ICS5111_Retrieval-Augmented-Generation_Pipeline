{"summary": "animal studies of acute lung injury suggest nebulised heparin may limit damage from fibrin deposition in the alveolar space and microcirculation. no human studies have been undertaken to date. 190,600 cases of ALI develop in the united states each year. it is associated with 74,500 deaths and 3.6 million hospital days. there is currently no method to prevent or treat ALI. heparin infusion reduced evidence of pulmonary microvascular thrombosis [21]. we undertook the present trial to assess the feasibility, safety and potential anticoagulant effects of nebulised heparin in mechanically ventilated patients with ALI. hypoxemia predominantly due to a cause other than ALI. congestive heart failure, pulmonary embolism, chronic obstructive airways disease or asthma. systemic anticoagulation (including activated protein C), potential need for haemofiltration and therefore anticoagulation. prothrombin fragments (PTF) and tissue plasminogen activator levels in bronchoalveolar lavage were assessed at baseline and following the final nebulisation. the alveolar dead space fraction was measured with the Cosmo Plus Respironics monitor (Novametrix Medical Systems, Wallingford, CT, USA) the inclusion criterion was the initiation of mechanical ventilation for acute respiratory dysfunction characterised by a PaO2/FiO2 ratio 300 mmHg. the acute respiratory dysfunction was primarily due to a direct or indirect inflammatory insult to the lung. hypoxemia predominantly due to a cause other than ALI. the alveolar dead space fraction was measured with the Cosmo Plus Respironics monitor. previous studies have suggested this variable may reflect the extent of microvascular thrombosis in ALI. analysis of variance used to compare effect of heparin dose on paO2/FiO2 ratio, lung compliance, alveolar dead space fraction, APTT, the TCT and intrapulmonary PTF and t-PA levels. data are reported as the mean standard deviation. chronic health evaluation II score 22.3 6.0 21.8 8.7 18.3 10 20.0 3.4 20.6 7.0 Subcutaneous heparin 4 3 4 3 14 (88) Lung compliance (ml/cmH2O) 30 7 19 5 37 21 22 14 26 14 Alveolar dead space fraction 0.15 0.04 0.3 0.10 0.17 0.07 0.24 0.1 0.23 0.1 Creatinine (mol/l) 80 45 56 14 130 154 97 45 91 80 Activated partial a patient in the 400,000 U/day group developed blood-stained respiratory secretions after the seventh dose. the blood staining resolved following withdrawal of nebulised heparin. last dose of heparin was given at 36 hours for all groups except the 400,000 U/day group. it was administered at 42 hours (mean levels; P = 0.06, comparison of 46-hour and 58-hour timepoints in the 400,000 U/day group) the last dose of heparin was given at 36 hours for all groups except the 400,000 U/day group. comparison of tissue plasminogen activator levels in bronchoalveloar fluid. levels were assessed at baseline and following the final dose of nebulised heparin (mean and standard deviation) patient characteristics Sixteen patients were enrolled. no statistically significant differences were found for the dosage or for the interaction between dosage and time. changes in arterial to inspired oxygen ratio with nebul were similar for all doses studied. a patient in the 400,000 U/day group developed blood-stained respiratory secretions after the seventh dose. this was not associated with any deterioration in lung function. the blood staining resolved following withdrawal of nebulised heparin. APTT at baseline and following the final dose of nebulised heparin. the last dose of heparin was given at 36 hours for all groups except the 400,000 U/day group. the t-PA levels were similar to baseline levels for all doses following the final nebulisation. levels were assessed at baseline and following the final dose of nebulised heparin (mean and standard deviation) levels were assessed at baseline and following the final dose of nebulised heparin. nebulised heparin limited coagulation and increased fibrinolysis in the lungs. previous trials in patients with ventilated-associated pneumonia also found a doubling of coagulation levels in BAL fluid over the first few days. four patients in each group would provide adequate power to detect a major anticoagulant effect. previous studies in animal models of ALI demonstrated significant improvements in pulmonary function with inhaled heparin. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions BD designed the study, collected the data, performed the statistical analysis and drafted the manuscript."}
