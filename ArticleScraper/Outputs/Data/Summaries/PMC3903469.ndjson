{"summary": "population-based descriptive study was carried out between 2007 and 2010 with RTI patient records from the Fifth Center Hospital of Tianjin. results People between the ages of 16 and 55 were the most likely to suffer RTIs. floating migrants had a different age distribution, severity of injuries, diseases, inpatient duration and hospitalization cost compared to local resident patients. rural-urban migration poses significant challenges for china's welfare system. without local household registration, the floating migrants are not entitled to some of the benefits that local people enjoy. they face daunting problems with access to healthcare, adequate housing, employment opportunities, pension plans and school enrollment for their children. from 1991 to 2005, the proportion of all injury deaths due to traffic accident increased from 15.00% to 33.79% clearly showing a rising trend. a sampling survey of injury deaths in Chinese people also found that, from 1991 to 2005, the proportion of all injury deaths due to traffic accident increased from 15.00% to 33.79% clearly showing a rising trend. all emergency patients were treated at best regardless of their household registration. traffic accidents sufferers who died before arriving at the hospital were not included, because the persons dead at the scene were not transferred to hospital. all the emergency patients were treated at best regardless of their household registration. traffic accidents sufferers who died before arriving at the hospital were not included, because the persons dead at the scene were not transferred to hospital. there were 1,295 local resident patients and 929 floating migrant patients. the proportion of floating migrant patients was 42.8%, 42.1%, 44.1% and 37.5% for each year of the study. the average risks of RTI over the four years for local residents and floating migrants were 0.632 and 1.005 per thousand people. the peak number of local and floating migrant patients emerged between the ages of 46 and 55. that of floating migrant patients occurred between the ages of 16 and 45. the proportion of floating migrant patients was also calculated for each month. in the head injury group, the proportions of floating migrant patients classified as mild, moderate and severe were 40.1%, 48.4% and 50% respectively. in the multiple body regions injury group, these proportions were 39.3%, 42.1% and 46.3% respectively. there were 326 local resident patients and 406 floating migrant patients that had open injuries. the amounts of floating migrant patients were more than those of local resident patients in each of the open injuries except open wound of thigh and elbow. the results showed that floating migrant patients were more vulnerable to open injuries. fractures that appeared in at least 20 cases were sifted out. ribs and clavicle are the most vulnerable parts of body to fracture. ribs and clavicle are the most vulnerable parts of body to fracture. migrant patients were 42.8%, 42.1%, 44.1% and 37.5% for each year of the study. the average risks of RTI over the four years for local residents and floating migrants were 0.632 and 1.005 per thousand people. between the ages of 16 and 45. Figure 3. Age distribution of local and floating migrant RTI patients from 2007 to 2010. the number of patients each month was counted and the sum over 12 months was calculated. in the multiple body regions injury group, these proportions were 39.3%, 42.1% and 46.3% respectively. figure 4. Area of the body injured, as a proportion of total RTIs, from 2007 to 2010. the amounts of floating migrant patients were more than those of local resident patients in each of the open injuries except open wound of thigh and elbow. local patients Migrant patients RTIs T N A* STD* N A* STD* Prop. the ribs and clavicle are the most vulnerable parts of body to fracture. the ribs and clavicle are the most vulnerable parts of body to fracture. the average, median, 25% percentile, 75% percentile and standard deviation of inpatient duration and total cost distribution were calculated. floating migrant patients accounted for 41.6% of RTIs during the four years. male patients made up the majority of traffic accident sufferers, likely because men are generally the main laborers in society. pre-school children had a higher accident incidence compared to school-children under the age of 16. float migrant patients had a higher accident incidence between ages 16 and 45. local resident patients had a higher accident incidence between ages 46 and 55. floating migrant patients accounted for 34.6% and 37% of all patients in a traffic accident. the proportion of floating migrant patients increased as the severity of injury increased. floating migrants are more vulnerable to severe RTIs compared with local residents. floating migrant patients were more vulnerable to open injuries. fractures with larger proportions were usually associated with high-energy crashes. but fractures with smaller proportions were usually associated with low-energy crashes. the unit of A, M, Q, 3Q and S is years old. the unit of A, M, Q, 3Q and S is years old."}
