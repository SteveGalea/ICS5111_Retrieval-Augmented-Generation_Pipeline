{"summary": "acute exacerbation (AE) is a frequent episode during the prolonged chronic course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which entails significant morbidity and mortality. the common aetiological factors of AECOPD are bacterial, viral infection and air pollutants. the amplification efficiency of LAMP is higher than PCR, because there is no time loss for thermal change based on its isothermal reaction. amplification efficiency of LAMP is higher than PCR, because there is no time loss for thermal change based on its isothermal reaction. using of two additional loop primers accelerates LAMP reaction, but also further improves kinetics and sensitivity of the LAMP reaction. 46 healthy controls were defined as healthy individuals residing in Jiangxi Province, who were COPD negative, had no clinical symptoms related to respiratory infections. each patient collected two sputum specimens which used for routine culture and LAMP assays. male/female 74/46 31/15 Duration of acute symptoms, d* 10.3 (6.1) Smoking, n/N (%) Nonsmokers 46 (38.3) 5 (10.9) Current smokers 17 (14.2) 29 (63) Respiratory rate/min* 19.7 (3.3) 17.6 (3.8) Pulse rate/min* 83.9 (12.4) 79.1 (13.7) Temperature > 37.5\u00b0C, n/N 18/120 Leukocytes > primer sequences used for amplification of pathogenic bacteria DNA by LAMP assay Species Gene GenBank No. Primer Sequence S. pneumoniae lytA AJ243399 F3 CTGGAGGAAGCACACAGA B3 GTCTGGTTTGAGGTAGTACC FIP CACCTTCTTCGTACCA-CTGGTTTTTCTAAGTCCAGG BIP GACAGGCTGGTAATGATTGG BIP AGGACCGAAGCAAC-GCGGATT ATCTGG BIP TCTTGCCCGATATTCACACC-CGAAAATGCCGGAAGAGGTA LF GCAGGCGCCATGGTC LB AGCCAGCTGGTGGTCG P. aeruginosa oprI M25761 F3 CTGGATATTTTTTTTGAACAAACGA B3 GTTCATCATTATCCTTA FIP TAAACTGACCAAGCGCAAGCGCAATC LF AGCAACTTTTTTTTTAGTCCCC data from sputum cultures were purchased from Biochip Beijing National Engineering Research Center. the standard bacteria strains were diluted by 10-fold gradient to establish a standard curve of bacterial titers. the titers in sputum specimens would be calculated based on the obtained Ct values. reaction mixture (25.0 L) containing 12.5 L Isothermal Master Mix, 1.6 M of each inner primer (FIP and BIP), 0.2 M of each outer primer (F3 and B3), 0.8 M of each loop primer (LPF and BPF), 8 U of Bst DNA polymerase, 0.8 mM of dNTPs, 0.8 M betaine, 8 mM MgSO4, 0.3 mM EvaGreen and 2 ng template DNA. sputum cultures were considered positive (proving bacterial infection) if significant bacterial growth was present as defined by the number of bacteria (higher than 105 colony forming units14cfu) in a representative sample. 46 healthy controls were defined as healthy individuals residing in Jiangxi Province, who were COPD negative, had no clinical symptoms related to respiratory infections. each patient collected two sputum specimens which used for routine culture and LAMP assays. /120 Lung function* FEV1, L 1.6 (0.4) 3.1 (0.8) FEV1, % pred 43.1 (7.7) 83.5 FVC, L 2.3 (0.6) 3.7 (0.7) FVC, % pred 59.4 (6.2) 95.6 FEV1/FVC 68.3% (15.3) 83.8 Dyspnea, n/N (%)# Mild 9 (7.5) Moderate 64 (53.3) Severe 47 (39.2) LF AGCGATTTTCTTCCAGCC LB CTTAGACGCTAAAGAAGGCG S. aureus femA BA000033 F3 TGAATCATGATGGCGAGAT B3 CGTGTTTCTCTAAGTCCA FIP ATGGAATCCAGTATGTTTTCAAATCCT-AGGTGTTAGA E. coli phoA U00096 F3 CGCGGTTATCAGTTGG B3 CCCGGTTACACTG data from LAMP assays and sputum cultures Groups Brands Sputum culture Total P (+) Healthy controls LAMP (+) 2 3 5 > 0.1 (-) 5 36 41 Total 7 39 46 AECOPD patients LAMP (+) 20 53 73 0.027 (-) 5 42 47 Total 25 95 120 Standard bacterial strains. standard concentration of bacteria Standard Streptococcus pnuemoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pnuemoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, and Haemophilus influenzae were purchased from Biochip Beijing National Engineering Research Center. the reaction was performed at 65\u00b0C for 45 min in a loopamp real-time turbidmeter (LA-200; Teramecs) and then heated above 80\u00b0C for 2 min to terminate the reaction. negative controls (double distilled water and genomic DNA in serum of AECOPD patients) were included in each run. the FEV1/FVC value less than 60% is considered positive. the relatedness with results of bacterial titers was analyzed by Fisher\u2019s exact and McNemar\u2019s tests. results Sensitivity and specificity of the LAMP assay. a total of 25 sputum specimens (20.8%) were detected positive bacteria by sputum culture. 73 sputum specimens (60.8%) were detected positive bacteria by LAMP assay. 7 sputum samples (15.2%) in 46 healthy controls were detected positive bacteria by sputum culture. LAMP assay was more sensitive than sputum culture in detecting sputum pathogenic bacteria. showed that LAMP assay was more sensitive than sputum culture in detecting sputum pathogenic bacteria. culture (-) 15 LAMP (-) 1 H. influenzae Culture (+) 9 17.5% LAMP (+) 9 7.5% 35.250 0.001 Culture (-) 12 LAMP (-) 0 Relatedness between FEV1/FVC values and bacterial titers results. bacterial titers results of sputum culture were consistent with FEV1/FVC value of these patients (P > 0.1) both LAMP products and melting curves of DNA in sputum samples and serum samples were used to analyze the specificity of the LAMP assay. the results demonstrated that partial sputum DNA samples from AECOPD patients can be detected positive, but all DNA samples from the negative controls showed no positive products. 5 sputum samples (10.9%) were detected positive bacteria by LAMP assay. results showed that the positive rate of LAMP assay for AECOPD was significantly higher than that detected by sputum culture. putum culturing methods strains LAMP Sputum Culture 2 P Positive Number Positive Rate Positive Number Positive Rate S. pnuemoniae Culture (+) 9 22.5% LAMP (+) 9 8.3% 24.438 0.001 Culture (-) 18 LAMP (-) 1 S. aureus Culture (+) 4 10.8% LAMP (+) 4 3.3% 19.026 0.001 Culture (-) 9 LAMP (-) 0 E. coli Culture (+) 3 7.5% L the result from Fisher\u2019s exact and McNemar\u2019s tests showed that positive bacterial results of sputum culture were inconsistent with FEV1/FVC value of these patients. 45 sputum specimens (3.3%) with positive FEV1/FVC value which lower than 60%, but could not detect positive bacteria by sputum culture. sensitivity and accuracy of LAMP results are susceptible to be affected by the effect of sequence mutations on pathogenic bacterium. however, it is still possible that clinical strains harbor mutations on sequences where primers are designed. sputum culture only detects all living bacterial cells grown in the medium. um culture results were consistent with FEV1/FVC value of patients. bacterial titers results by LAMP assay were more consistent with sputum culturing method."}
