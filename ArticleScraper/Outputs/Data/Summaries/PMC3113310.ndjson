{"summary": "splice-spliced introns were introduced into crucial gene-expression units of adenovirus vector and alphavirus DNA/RNA layered vectors. their effects on the viral gene expression, replication and/or release of infectious genomes were studied in cell culture. this approach represents a novel, universal and powerful method for controlling gene expression, replication, viral spread and, by extension, virus-induced cytotoxic effects. the ability to use and control these processes is at the origin of virus-based gene-technology applications, such as the delivery of transgenes or the use of viruses for vaccinal or vaccine-carrier purposes. gene expression, replication, virion formation and cytotoxicity are dependent on the E1A proteins expressed via a constitutively active promoter. alphaviruses (family Togaviridae) represent one of the most promising candidates for vaccine and anticancer vectors. replicon vectors lack the region coding for viral structural proteins. splicing patterns can be regulated by antisense splice-switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) [25-28] created novel possibilities for regulating viral gene expression and replication. however, the insertion of introns into their cDNA sequences is often used for the construction of corresponding DNA/RNA layered vectors. luciferase reporter Luc7 contains a second intron from the human beta-globin gene with a thalassemic T705G mutation. for Luc6+7, the mutation C654T (IVS2654) [36] was added; for Luc0, the intron was deleted. luciferase reporter Luc7 contains a second intron from the human beta-globin gene. the sequences of LucWT, Luc7 or Luc6+7 reporters were PCR amplified and cloned into the pShuttle-CMV vector using the restriction sites KpnI and NotI. adenovirus stocks were propagated by one passage in HEK293 cells; virus particles were collected, purified and titrated using an endpoint-dilution method. the luciferase gene with an intron was inserted into the cDNA region corresponding to the SFV nsP4 gene. if the primary transcript remains unspliced or aberrantly spliced, these introns interrupt the reading frame encoding for viral replicase, resulting in a lethal defect. the designs of all the SFV DNA/RNA layered vectors are shown in Figure 1. the plasmid backbone of the vector is not shown. the nsP1-4 region corresponding to ns-proteins of SFV is not shown. OMe RNA oligonucleotides designated as ON705 (5'-CCUCUUACCUCAGUUACA-3'), ON654 (5'-GCUAUUACCUUAACCCAG-3') were obtained from GE Healthcare (Little Chalfont, UK) oligonucleotides were used in transfection mixtures at a final concentration of 100 nM. the same reagent was also used to deliver the plasmid vectors RNA purification and reveres-transcription (RT) PCR analysis Total RNA from transfected or infected cells was purified using TriZol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) cDNA was synthesized using first Strand cDNA synthesis kit (Fermentas; Vilnius, Lithuania), purified and used as a template for PCR amplification with primers SF (5'-TGAAGAAGAGCTGTTTTTACGATCCCTTCA-3 all other luciferase reporters were created by site-directed mutagenesis. to obtain LucWT, the T705G mutation was reverted; for Luc6+7, the mutation C654T (IVS2654) [36] was added; for Luc0, the intron was deleted. cells were infected with virus stock at 0.5 PFU/cell in 200 l serum-free IMDM media. cells were incubated for an additional 24 h at 37\u00b0C. luciferase activity was then measured using a Luciferase assay system. sequence encoding for EGFP was placed under control of the SFV promoter. variants from all replicon vectors were prepared by a frame-shift mutation (4 b insertion) into the replicase region (at position 6,138) of SFV. oligonucleotides were used in transfection mixtures at a final concentration of 100 nM. the same reagent was also used to deliver the plasmid vectors to the cells. ICA with replication-competent SFV DNA/RNA layered vectors. a modified ICA protocol was used to estimate the infectivity of replication-competent DNA/RNA layered vectors for HeLa cells when SFV isolates failed to form distinctive plaques. the cells were electroporated with vector DNA using a Bio-Rad (hercules, CA, USA) Gene Pulser II (one pulse at 220 V/975 F) luciferase expression by Luc6+7 was approximately thirty-fold lower than LucWT. this result demonstrates the strong inhibitory effect of the artificial intron. both aberrantly spliced introns reduced luciferase expression more than fifty-fold. this demonstrates the strong inhibitory effect of the artificial intron. marker by AdenoLuc705 and AdenoLuc654+705 was activated three-fold and thirteen-fold respectively. luciferase activities from both series (ONINV and ON654+ON705 transfected cells) were normalized to the activities obtained for AdenoLucWT infected cells, which were defined as 100%. mRNAs produced from AdenoLuc654+705 were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. this assay revealed that the mRNAs from the Luc6+7 reporter were efficiently spliced because no product corresponding to unspliced RNA was detected. only small amounts of correctly spliced products were observed and, surprisingly, no use of the incorrect splicing site at position 705 was detected. introns in LucWT, Luc7 or Luc6+7 reporters are not correctly removed by splicing, the reading frame of the SFV replicase is disrupted. the presence of an intron with a T705G mutation in an A2 vector resulted in less than a 50% reduction of luciferase expression compared to the A1 vector. intron with two mutations in an A3 vector resulted in a nearly four-fold the EGFP signal appeared in cells transfected with wt or aberrantly spliced introns. the FS mutation reduced luciferase expression approximately ten-fold. the intron with the T705G mutation reduced marker expression approximately two-fold. the intron with two mutations reduced marker expression approximately eight-fold. mRNAs resulting from aberrant splicing express only P123 polyprotein. luciferase activities in HeLa cells at 24 h after transfection with vectors B1, C0, D0 and E0 are represented on the vertical axis. left panel, results for DNA/RNA layered replicon vectors. luciferase expression was reduced by 30% by aberrant splicing. the EGFP expression by C0, D0 and E0 vectors was not abolished. but expectedly failed to reveal any significant effect of the intron in nsP4 region on expression. the combination of these introns resulted in inhibitory effects similar to those observed for FS vectors containing a single aberrantly spliced intron in the luciferase-reporter region. insertion of aberrantly spliced introns reduces infectivity of SFV DNA/RNA layered replication-competent vectors. insertion of one or two wt introns from the human beta-globin gene had no insertion of two aberrantly spliced introns caused more pronounced effects. the effect of an aberrantly spliced intron or introns was greater in HeLa than in BHK-21 cells. this may result from the fact that introns with the IVS2705 and IVS2654 mutations had a human origin. luciferase activity can also be used to accurately estimate the infectivity of the corresponding DNA/RNA layered replication-competent vectors. effect caused by the insertion of aberrantly spliced introns can be reversed through the use of SSOs with plasmid vectors in transfected cells or in stable cell lines. the activity of an E3 replicon was analyzed in the presence of ON705 or/and ON654. despite the presence of target sites for both SSOs, they were found to be unequally efficient. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the splicing pattern of the intron in the E3 vector, as well as the effects of SSOs on this pattern were identical to those observed with an adenovirus vector. layered replicon vectors by ON654, ON705 or their combination were transfected with the indicated SSOs at final concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 40, 100 or 200 nM 24 h prior to transfection with E3 vector. luciferase activity produced by the vector at 24 h post-transfection is represented on the vertical axis. error bars represent standard deviations; the results of one of three reproducible experiments are shown. the magnitude of activation was over twenty times for the D2 and C2 vectors. the biggest activation was observed for the E3 vector, where its activity was restored to a level comparable to that of the B1 vector. these results imply that mutants with even greater defects can be efficiently rescued with an appropriate mixture of SSOs. luciferase expression by Luc6+7 was approximately thirty-fold lower than LucWT. this result demonstrates the strong inhibitory effect of the artificial intron. both aberrantly spliced introns reduced luciferase expression more than fifty-fold. this demonstrates the strong inhibitory effect of the artificial intron. effects of insertion of aberrantly spliced intron and SSOs on adenovirus vector. expression of luciferase in both series (ONINV and ON654+ON705 transfected cells) were normalized to the activities obtained for AdenoLucWT infected cells, which were defined as 100%. 5 were analyzed by semiquantitative RT-PCR. this assay revealed that the mRNAs from the Luc6+7 reporter were efficiently spliced because no product corresponding to unspliced RNA was detected. in the absence of SSOs, the intron containing two thalassemic mutations was dominantly spliced using the splicing site at position 654. introns in LucWT, Luc7 or Luc6+7 reporters are not correctly removed by splicing, the reading frame of the SFV replicase is disrupted. luciferase marker can be expressed from correctly spliced transcripts produced by the transcription of the vector plasmid in the cell nucleus and from replicating replicon RNAs produced in the cytoplasm. introns with an FS mutation reduced luciferase expression approximately ten-fold (A1FS compared to A1) and abolished any EGFP expression. replication is important, but not the sole factor responsible for the relatively small differences in luciferase expression between the vectors. luciferase activities in HeLa cells at 24 h after transfection with vectors B1, C2, D2 and E3 are represented on the vertical axis. left panel, results for DNA/RNA layered replicon vectors. right panel, results for DNA/RNA layered replicon vectors. luciferase expression was not abolished but slightly delayed. insertion of one aberrantly spliced intron was clearly insufficient to suppress release of autonomously replicating transcripts. SFV DNA/RNA layered replicon vectors containing two introns were constructed and analyzed. insertion of aberrantly spliced introns reduces infectivity of SFV DNA/RNA layered replication-competent vectors. pCMV-SFV4 contains a wt intron from the rabbit beta-globin gene. however, it was found that the insertion of one or two wt introns from the human beta-globin gene had no effect on the efficiency of infectious virus rescue from the corresponding constructs. ICA was performed with HeLa cells, only the constructs lacking an aberrantly spliced intron produced plaques. this may result from the fact that the introns with the IVS2705 and IVS2654 mutations had a human origin and therefore the mutations had less effect in rodent cells. the difference may originate from the different efficiency of the alphavirus DNA/RNA layered vector in different cell lines. luciferase activity can also be used to accurately estimate the infectivity of the corresponding SFV replication-competent vectors. the effect caused by the insertion of aberrantly spliced introns can be reversed through the use of SSOs with plasmid vectors in transfected cells or in stable cell lines. activity of an E3 replicon was analyzed in the presence of ON705 or/and ON654. despite the presence of target sites for both SSOs, they were found to be unequally efficient. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the splicing pattern of the intron in the E3 vector, as well as the effects of SSOs on this pattern, were identical to those observed with an adenovirus vector. cells were transfected with the indicated SSOs at final concentrations of 0, 10, 20, 40, 100 or 200 nM 24 h prior to transfection with E3 vector. open columns represent activities obtained in the presence of ON705, gray columns represent activities obtained in the presence of ON654 and black columns represent activities obtained in the presence of both SSOs. the presence of these SSOs or their combination resulted in up to a two-fold activation of rescue and/or subsequent replication of the B the biggest activation was observed for the E3 vector, where its activity was restored to a level comparable to that of the B1 vector. these results imply that mutants with even greater defects, for example a larger number of defective introns, can probably be efficiently rescued with an appropriate mixture of SSOs. this method may have potential as a new therapeutic approach against viruses that are difficult to target by conventional means. but in general, this method would be unlikely to have advantages over the inhibition of viral gene expression and replication using conventional antisense oligonucleotides or siRNAs that target viral RNAs for degradation. an alternative possibility is to use splice-switching technology to control the release, gene expression, replication and virus-induced pathologies for genetically modified viruses. RNA layered vectors of SFV resulted in increased effect and suppressed release of infectious RNA. transfection is not nearly as effective as natural RNA delivery in infection. RNAs made in the nucleus are intrinsically less efficient in replication initiation than those delivered by a natural infection route. data obtained for vectors with FS mutations indicates aberrant splicing did not negatively affect the transport of mRNA from the nucleus or its stability. however, these mRNAs did contain the correct cis-elements required for replication and transcription, accumulated in transfected cells. it is also known that the alphavirus replicase complex, when provided in trans, is capable of replicating such templates [18,22] splice-switching is feasible for the construction of conditionally activated systems of different viruses. splice-switching can be easily combined with other techniques used for the construction of regulated viral vectors. the method is straightforward and can be easily combined with other techniques used for the construction of regulated viral vectors. authors' contributions LV performed experiments with replication-competent virus vectors, GH performed experiments with adenovirus and SFV replicon vectors. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
