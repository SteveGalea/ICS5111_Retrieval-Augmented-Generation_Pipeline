{"summary": "HCV is a small and enveloped RNA virus belonging to the Flaviviridae family. it contains a single-stranded positive-sense RNA of approximately 9.6 kb. the polyprotein precursor is then cleaved into at least 10 distinct proteins. STATs act as signal messengers and transcription factors. actives downstream target genes (20, 40), including c-Fos, cyclin D1 (CCND1), cell division cycle 25A (CDC25A), c-Myc, proviral integration site 1 (Pim1), and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) (5). the Bcl-2-related genes regulate cell death and are considered to correlate with the pathogenesis and progression of cancers. members of the suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) family play key regulatory roles in many cellular processes. these kinases can be activated by phosphatidylserine (PS) and diacylglycerol (DAG) in a Ca2+-dependent manner and also by tumor-promoting phorbol esters such as phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) the ERK, JNK, and PKC signaling pathways are involved in the upregulation of STAT3 activity in response to HCV infection. we also discuss the mechanism underlying the role of HCV NS4B in controlling multiple signaling pathways. HCV genotype 1b/genotype 3b NA 13/7 a All HCV-positive individuals were confirmed to be negative for HBV, HDV, and HIV-1.

RNA was retrotranscribed with primers specific for the 5\u2032 untranslated region of HCV. nested PCR was performed using two different primer sets. gels were stained with 0.5% Coomassie G250 (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA) in methanol-acetic acid-H2O. cells were washed twice with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) they were then harvested and incubated in 2 volumes of buffer A (10 mM HEPES, pH 8.0, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 10 mM KCl, 0. blots were analyzed using a luminescent image analyzer. cells were washed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, washed three times with PBS, and blocked with 4% bovine serum albumin for 1 h at room temperature. the cells were visualized by confocal laser microscopy. the experiments were reproducible, and each set was repeated at least three times with similar results. the relative mRNA levels of MMP-2 and Bcl-2 were increased in HCV-positive individuals compared to HCV-negative individuals. these results demonstrate that HCV activates STAT3. nested PCR analyses showed that HCV plus-strand RNA was detected in the PBMCs of 12 of the 20 patients. 7.5.1 cells were infected with JFH-1 at different titers for 6 days. protein levels were monitored to ensure that HCV was replicating in the cells. the mechanism involved in the activation of STAT3 by HCV infection was investigated in vitro. l-2, p-ERK, and p-JNK proteins were enhanced in cells infected with HCV in a dose-dependent fashion. levels of the ERK, JNK, and -actin proteins were relatively unchanged during HCV infection. the NS4B protein of HCV activates MMP-2 and Bcl-2 expression by repressing SOCS3 production. pCMV-core, pCMV-E1, pCMV-E2, pCMV-P7, pCMV-NS4A, pCMV-NS4A, pCMV-NS4B, pCMV-NS5A, or pCMV-NS5B expressing the HCV proteins. luciferase activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods. Huh7 cells were transfected with pCMV-NS4B or control vector for 48 h. after fixation, the cells were immunostained with antibody for STAT3. NS5A is known to activate STAT3, interact with Bax, and inhibit apoptosis in hepatocellular carcinoma. p-STAT3, MMP-2, and Bcl-2 proteins were increased in a dose-dependent manner, while the STAT3 protein was slightly increased by 1.45-fold. further investigation revealed that the level of the STAT3 protein was slightly affected by NS4B in whole-cell lysates. NS4B protein may play a role in stimulating STAT3 translocation from the cytosol to the nucleus. mRNA and protein levels were not affected by si-STAT3. results suggest that overexpression of STAT3 upregulates MMP-2 and Bcl-2. knockdown of STAT3 downregulates MMP-2 and Bcl-2. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with pCMV-NS4B or pCMV-Flag2A. p-STAT3 and -actin proteins were measured by Western blot analysis. Huh7 cells were transfected with pCMV-NS4B and treated with pCMV-NS4B. results indicate levels of STAT3, MMP-2, and Bcl-2 mRNA were enhanced by NS4B but repressed by SP600125 and U0126. roles of ERK and JNK in the activation of STAT3 mediated by NS4B were further evaluated by introducing three dominant kinase-inactive mutants. NK proteins were significantly enhanced by NS4B. the levels of the ERK, JNK, and -actin proteins were unaffected by NS4B. NS4B plays a role in the activation of the ERK and JNK signaling pathway. p-JNK, p-ERK, p-STAT3, and Bcl-2 proteins were stimulated by NS4B. they were repressed by si-PKC, si-PKC, and si-PKC. these results suggest that PKC, PKC, and PKC are involved in the NS4B-mediated activation of STAT3. Huh7 cells were transfected with pCMV-NS4B and treated with si-JNK or si-Ctrl at different concentrations. levels of p-STAT3, STAT3, MMP-2, Bcl-2, and -actin proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. the activity of STAT3 was significantly reduced when cells were transfected with both si-JNK and si-ERK (40 nmol) the activity of STAT3 was significantly reduced when cells were transfected with both si-JNK and si-ERK (40 nmol) the NS4B CTD is sufficient for the activation of STAT3, JNK, ERK, MMP-2, and Bcl-2. NS4B protein mutated into expression vector to yield four plasmids. pCMV-NS4BC1, pCMV-NS4BCTD, pCMV-NS4BCTD, and pCMV-NS4BCTD. Huh7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing NS4B protein or its mutants. the relative levels of MMP-2 and Bcl-2 mRNA were measured at 48 h posttransfection using real-time PCR. the effects of these mutant NS4B proteins on the regulation of MMP-2, Bcl-2, STAT3, ERK, and -actin proteins were determined by Western blot analysis. NS4B CTD is sufficient for activation of STAT3, ERK, and JNK. a series of NS4B point mutations was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. amino acids 228D, 237L, 239S, 241T, 245L, and 250H were replaced by 228A, 237E, 239W. PBMCs were isolated from HCV-positive individuals (n = 20) and HCV-negative individuals (n = 20) real-time RT-PCR showed that the relative mRNA levels of STAT3 were approximately 3-fold higher in HCV-positive individuals compared to HCV-negative individuals. PBMCs were isolated from 20 patients with HCV infection. mRNA levels of MMP-2, Bcl-2, and STAT3 were measured using real-time PCR. nested PCR was used as an internal reference. levels of the p-STAT3, MMP-2, and Bcl-2 proteins in infected cells were increased in a time-dependent manner. levels of STAT3 proteins were slightly increased by 1.17-fold at 6 days postinfection. phosphorylation of STAT3 is regulated by the JNK and ERK signaling cascade. luciferase activity assay showed that STAT3 promoter activity was activated by NS4B or NS5A. other proteins had a slight or no effect on the STAT3 promoter. luciferase activity was measured as described in Materials and Methods. Huh7 cells were transfected with pCMV-NS4B or pCMV-Flag2A. protein levels in whole-cell lysates, the cytoplasm, and the nucleus were determined by Western blot analysis using antibodies to STAT3. RT-PCR results showed that STAT3, MMP-2, and Bcl-2 mRNAs were stimulated by NS4B but SOCS3 (a suppressor of STAT3) mRNA was repressed by NS4B. STAT3 is activated by phosphorylation, which induces translocation from the cytosol to nucleus to regulate target genes. NS4B activates the phosphorylation of STAT3 and promotes translocation of STAT3 from the cytosol to the nucleus in the presence of NS4B. ERK, JNK, and SOCS3 play critical roles in the regulation of STAT3 signaling mediated by NS4B. Huh7 cells were transfected with pCMV-NS4B or pCMV-Flag2A. p-STAT3 and -actin proteins were measured by Western blot analysis. p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, JNK, and -actin proteins were determined. pCMV-NS4B treated with si-SOCS3 or si-Ctrl at different concentrations. results indicate that p-STAT3, STAT3, MMP-2, and Bcl-2 proteins were enhanced in the presence of si-SOCS3 in dose-dependent fashion. p-STAT3, STAT3, STAT3, MMP-2, and -actin were not affected by si-SOCS3. Huh7 cells were cotransfected with pCMV-NS4B V12. p-STAT3 protein was activated by NS4B and V12 but repressed by mERK1, mERK2 and mJNK in a dose-dependent manner. p-ERK and p-JNK proteins were significantly enhanced by NS4B. PKC activates ERK, JNK, and p38 to regulate the myogenic program in human rhabdomyosarcoma cells. siRNA molecules specific to each of the PKC isozymes were designed and used previously. results showed that MMP-2 and Bcl-2 mRNA levels were increased in presence of NS4B. Huh7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing si-PKC, si-PKC, si-PKC, si-PKC, si-PKC, or si-Ctrl. similar vector (pSilencer 2.0) containing irrelevant sequence does not have significant homology to any human gene. Huh7 cells were transfected with pCMV-NS4B and treated with si-ERK (80 nmol), si-JNK (80 nmol), or si-ERK (40 nmol) and si-JNK (40 nmol) the protein levels of p-STAT3, STAT3, MMP-2, Bcl-2, and -actin were determined by Western blot analysis. the NS4B CTD is sufficient for the activation of STAT3, JNK, ERK, MMP-2, and Bcl-2, and amino acids 237L, 239S, and 245L of NS4B are crucial for this regulation. the NS4B CTD is located on the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER membrane) Huh7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing NS4B protein. relative levels of p-STAT3, STAT3, MMP-2, Bcl-2, p-ERK, ERK, p-JNK, and -actin proteins were determined. NS4B, NS4B CTD, and NS4BC3 were activated by NS4B, NS4B CTD, and NS4BC3 but not by NS4BC1 or NS4BC2. results also showed that the p-STAT3, MMP-2, Bcl-2, p-ERK, and p-JNK proteins were upregulated by NS4B, NS4B CTD, and NS4BC3 but not real-time PCR showed that MMP-2 mRNA and Bcl-2 mRNA were activated by NS4B, D228A, T241A, and H250E but not by L237E, S239W, and L245D. these results suggest that amino acids 237L, 239S, and 245L play critical roles in the regulation of STAT3, ERK, and JNK, while amino acids 228D, 241T, and 250 the presence of the replicative form of HCV in PBMCs suggests that these cells can be a virus reservoir capable of reinfecting the liver in transplant patients or in subjects treated with IFN (56, 57). this lymphotropism may explain the association between this virus and certain lymphoproliferative disorders (LPDs) (51). STAT3 is involved in transduction of cellular signals and induction of gene expression in response to cytokine receptor stimulation (20, 40) the primary function of MMP-2 is to degrade proteins in the extracellular matrix. the mechanism by which HCV regulates STAT3, MMP-2, and Bcl-2 was investigated. NS4B activates MMP-2 and Bcl-2 expression by stimulating STAT3 signaling and repressing the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS3) expression. NS4B is a poorly characterized hydrophobic protein that may play a role in cell transformation and tumorigenesis. the cytosolic CTD plays an important role in HCV genome replication. NS4B is sufficient for the activation of STAT3, ERK, and JNK. the last 24 amino acids (residues 227 to 250) of NS4B play a critical role in regulation of STAT3 signaling pathways. signaling cascade, represses SOCS3 expression, and enhances STAT3 activity. stimulates MMP-2 and Bcl-2 expression, resulting in control of cell transformation, apoptosis, and tumorigenesis."}
