{"summary": "Johne\u2019s disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gastrointestinal tract of ruminants with granulomatous lesions that is caused by mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (MAP) the disease can be divided into four stages depending on the clinical signs and MAP shedding levels including the silent, subclinical, clinical, and advanced clinical stage. biomarkers indicating early stages of MAP-infection were proposed by analyzing gene expression profiles of blood in cattle with experimental MAP infection [17, 18] host biomarkers discovered using transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics have been proposed as alternative diagnostic methods for paratuberculosis. experimental design and animals About 300 Holstein cattle were raised on the national farm in Cheonan city. the cattle were regularly tested for absence of JD two times per year using fecal PCR and serum ELISA. detection was performed four times with a 6-month interval to enable accurate classification of infection status. n (%) 23 (52.3) 11 (100) 12 (100) 0 (0) 0 Fecal PCR Positive, n (%) 25 (56.8) 11 (100) 0 (0) 14 (100) 0 (0) 0 (0) 14 (100) 0 (0) Selection of biomarker candidates Nine genes that were significantly up-regulated in MAP infected macrophages, mice, and cattle were selected for use as diagnostic biomarkers. 0.0548 NM_174137 Serpin peptidase inhibitor Extracellular space 1.9 0.0041 1.6 0.0183 2.6 0.0009 NM_005143.3 Hp Haptoglobin Extracellular space 2.3 0.0031 3.2 0.0001 3.3 0.0003 NM_174471.3 Timp1 Tissue inhibitor of metallopeptidase 1 Extracellular space 1.7 0.0001 1.4 0.0002 0.5 0.415 NM_001324544.1 the combination showing the highest fluorescence value was tested at three different concentrations of the probe. real-time PCR Total RNA was employed to prepare cDNA with random primers using a QuantiTect\u00ae Reverse Transcription Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) the 2-Ct method uses the housekeeping gene, -actin, as a reference. target gene Primer sequence(5\u2019 to 3\u2019) PCR product size(base pair) reference.

RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis was performed. real-time PCR was highly sensitive to detect low level of gene expression of biomarker genes. negative control sample with no template DNA showed no increasing of fluorescence. fecal PCR and serum ELISA conducted three times with a 6 month interval. four genes (Tfrc, Hp, Serpine1, and Mmp9) were up-regulated in all infected groups. three genes (Timp1, Defb1, and Defb10) were up-regulated in the PN group and the NP group. gene expression level of biomarker genes in cattle infected with mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis compared to non-infected cattle. the most accurate biomarker in the PN group was Timp1, with an AUC value of 0.985. the most accurate biomarker in the PP group was S100a8, with an AUC value of 0.896. in the NP group, Timp1 showed the most accurate diagnostic performance, with a sensitivity of 92.9% and a specificity of 90.9%.

MAP0403 is kind of serine protease which served as a key element of the stress response network in intraphagosomal survival of MAP. Mmp9 is a matrix metalloproteinase related to leukocyte migration to infection sites and tissue destruction if it is secreted in excess amounts. the level of Mmp9 was regulated by Timp1, which inhibits the activity of MMP9 [45]. -defensins exhibit antimicrobial functions, providing first protection against pathogens while playing an immune-modulation role [47] the inconsistent gene expression levels between S100a8 and S100a9 might be related to the presence of the homodimer form. an ideal biomarker for diagnosis of JD should be able to discriminate between infected and non-infected animals with high sensitivity and specificity. a real-time PCR method was developed based on eight biomarkers. this could be used for diagnosis of JD, especially in subclinical stage animals. a real-time PCR method was developed based on biomarkers."}
