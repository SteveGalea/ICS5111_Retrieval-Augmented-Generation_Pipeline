{"summary": "PDCoV is a newly emerged swine enteropathogenic coronavirus. it can cause acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and mortality in pigs. PDCoV was first discovered in the rectal swab of pigs in 2012. multiple types of coronaviruses have evolved different strategies to evade cell innate immune response either by inhibiting the production of I-IFN or by disrupting I-IFN-involved innate immune signaling pathways. SARS-CoV has gained widespread attention since it first emerged as a huge threat to humans in 2002. MHV N protein inhibits the synthesis of IFN- by interacting with the protein activator of protein kinase R (PACT), which can bind to RIG-I and MDA5, promoting the production of IFN- [17]. as an avian coronavirus, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) escapes innate immune response by cleaving the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) microRNAs are a group of short noncoding RNAs known as gene regulators. miRNAs can modulate extensive bioprocesses by repressing expression of target genes at translation level and/or mRNA level. some of the host cell endogenous miRNAs play important roles in modulation of innate immune response affected by coronavirus. there has been no research into the host cell endogenous miRNAs. this study investigated the global gene expression profiles of PK-15 cells at 0, 24, 36 h post infection (hpi) via RNA sequencing. PDCoV infected PK-15 cells with 0.01 multiplicity of infection (MOI) and uninfected PK-15 cells in 96-well plates were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), then fixed with 100% ethanol for 30 min. cell wash was done in the same fashion as above. qRT-PCR Relative expression levels of 5 randomly selected genes were examined at 0, 24, and 36 hpi by qRT-PCR using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer. mRNAs with poly(A) in 3UTR were synthesized using a Magnesium RNA Fragmentation Module kit (NEB) high-quality cDNAs with insert sizes ranging from 250 to 300 bp were selected for further quantification via qRT-PCR. RNA sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeqTM 4000 platform (Novogene Corp.) threshold for differentially expressed gene screening was established to be a value of |log2(fold change in a comparison group)| > 1 and a false discovery rate (FDR, or padj) 0.05. pathway enrichment was analyzed based on the KEGG database (https://www.kegg.jp/kegg/kegg1.html) PK-15 cell culture PK-15 cells were cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (HyClone) and 1% penicillin and streptomycin. piglets were raised in a swine farm in a county under Tianjin municipal administration. cells were incubated with rabbit antiserum (against PDCoV N protein) at 1:200 dilution. reaction was kept at 37\u00b0C incubation for 1 h followed by 6 times of washing with PBS. cell wash was done in same fashion as above. the relative gene expression levels of the 5 genes were normalized to GAPDH expression using the 2-CT method. qRT-PCR reactions were performed on an ABI7500 StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) cDNA library preparation and sequencing The mRNAs with poly(A) in 3UTR were enriched from the total RNA using magnetic beads Oligo(dT) then disrupted into short fragments using a Magnesium RNA Fra RNA sequencing was performed using an Illumina HiSeqTM 4000 platform (Novogene Corp.) clean reads filtering and quality control High-quality clean reads were screened from raw reads by removing reads with sequencing adapters or unknown nucleobases. the FPKM (expected number of Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Million base pairs sequenced) of each gene was calculated and used to represent the gene expression value. GO function and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis were performed using GO software based on GO. pathway enrichment was analyzed based on the KEGG database. PDCoV-infected PK-15 cells inoculated with PDCoV at 0.1 MOI developed cytopathic effects (CPE) within 36 hpi. PDCoV induced CPEs on PK-15 cells was aggressively increased along with the increasing of PDCoV infection time. a total of approximately 1.6 billion raw reads were initially generated through sequencing. the reads with ambiguous nucleotides, and the reads of low quality, a total of nearly 156.2 million clean reads remained, with approximately 7.8 G bases per sample. the expression of all identified genes obtained through RNA sequencing was compared for the group of uninfected PK-15 cells and cells at 24 hpi. for INF_24h versus NC, there were 3,762 DEGs, with 2,660 genes upregulated and 1,102 genes downregulated in INF_24h. deGs upregulated in INF_36 h compared to INF_24 h, the same color coded dots as (A) 156 and 23 swine innate immune genes were differentially expressed in INF_24h versus NC. innate immune-associated genes of DEGs in INF_24h versus NC (A) and INF_36h versus INF_24h (B) were illustrated in heatmaps that were created based on the expression of each DEG. genes with upregulated tendencies in INF_24h comparing to NC were displayed in red while genes with downregulated tendencies were shown in blue. GO function enrichment analysis The DEGs in the 2 comparison groups were annotated by the Gene Ontology (GO) function database. the number of DEGs in the INF_24h versus NC comparison fell into each Gene function classification were higher than the number of DEGs in the INF_36h versus INF_24h comparison. genes which were upregulated in cells at 24 hpi were enriched in 99 terms of BP, 3 terms of CC, and 9 terms of MF. most of these genes were associated with response against viruses, host defense response, and immune response. most of these genes were associated with response against viruses, host defense response, and immune response.

TGEV, PEDV, and PDCoV are coronaviruses causing most severe swine enteric disease problems. however, even in the absence of TGEV and PEDV, PDCoV has high pathogenicity. PDCoV was the only pathogenic factor among these three viruses. ST, LLC-PK and IPI-2I were permissive to PDCoV in this study. but the degree of CPE in PK-15 cells from 24 hpi to 36 hpi showed an increasing tendency, but cells at 12 h different post infection (pi) time yielded a similar virus titer. genes which regulated by PDCoV for suppression of I-IFNs production or I-IFN response at 36 hpi were different. GO function and KEGG signaling pathways which enriched in two comparison groups were distinct. five innate immune-associated signaling pathways which were commonly enriched in 2 comparison groups are primarily affected during the alteration of innate immune response. receptor signaling pathway and Jak/STAT signaling pathway are located upstream and downstream of I-IFN respectively. other innate immune-related signaling pathways that are affected by PDCoV infection against the host cell innate immune response also deserve attention and should be explored further in the future.
