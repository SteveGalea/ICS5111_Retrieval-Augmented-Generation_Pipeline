(2) Objective 2 To identify the lessons learned from entry and exit screening referring to travelers at points of entry worldwide by using the evidence found in the literature and reports published by competent authorities or international organizations. exit screening is part of the international and domestic policies of competent authorities to control disease spread. it is part of the international and domestic policies of competent authorities to control disease spread and to minimize impact on travel and trade. to identify the relevant grey literature the following websites were searched: WHO (headquarters, regional offices), European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Public Health Agencies and Surveillance Centers of EU/EEA countries. a detailed list of all websites searched is included in appendix A. websites of WHO and national public health institutes were searched to identify publicly available surveillance data about the number of cases of the diseases targeted by screening measures. screening carried out on a routine basis or on an ad hoc basis after a public health event has occurred. the applied diagnosis protocol (laboratory and clinical examination) Number of cases identified, and total numbers of travelers screened for a specific timeframe. percentage of persons positive to screening that were diagnosed with the targeted disease. two researchers extracted independently data from the eligible articles. the following data were extracted from the papers/reports that fulfilled the inclusion/exclusion criteria of the review. results of the scoping search identified 82 scientific articles, six documents/reports from public health agencies of countries and 26 guidelines/reports from international organizations. 114 identified documents of scoping research can be categorized into categories. Influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 Screening cannot detect incubating or asymptomatic travelers I [24] SARS False declarations by passengers about exposure and disease signs and symptoms S [8,9,13,23] Entry screening measures did not detect any confirmed SARS cases in Australia, Canada, and Singapore. traveler passing through screening points to facilitate health monitoring and prompt referral for care if they became ill E [6] Maintaining confidence that air travel is safe E [6] Enabling humanitarian and public health organizations to sustain travel to affected areas by regular commercial airline flights. EVD-affected countries laid the foundation for future reconstruction efforts related to borders and travel. data from the scoping search were used to develop the algorithm for making evidence-based decisions in implementing entry and exit screening measures. no general conclusions about the impact of entry or exit screening for all infectious diseases could be drawn. the results of studies reviewed including type of screening, point of entry (airports, ports, ground crossings), infectious disease targeted, and country of measure implementation. all other screening measures were implemented as part of routine, long-term public health measures. airports Australia implemented entry and exit screening measures at airports to prevent EVD [31], Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases [20] and SARS [8]. in canada, entry and exit screening was applied for SARS [9] and entry screening for EVD at airports [22]. in china, entry screening took place for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [32]. in china, entry screening took place for EVD at airports [40] two-level program was applied at australia\u2019s seaports for SARS. the public health authorities of Belgium implemented entry screening for EVD at seaports located in priority areas [27] in Guinea, liberia, and Sierra Leone exit screening for EVD included temperature checkpoints, followed by emergency medical response, on-site isolation and use of personal protective equipment. entry screening measures were not part of WHO temporary recommendations for the outbreaks of EVD in West Africa, Poliovirus, EVD outbreak in DRC, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Yellow fever, Zika virus disease, Plague and the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 [5]. entry screening measures were not part of WHO temporary recommendations for the outbreaks of EVD in west africa, MERS, yellow fever, Zika virus disease, Plague and the Influenza Pandemic (H restrictions on travel and trade with Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone (29/3/2016) MERS 9 July 2013/ongoing, latest report on 3 September 2015 No IHR Emergency Committee concerning Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus No o international travel or trade restrictions (17/6/2015, ongoing, latest report on 3 September 2015) Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 25 April 2009/10 August 2010 Yes (25/4/2009) IHR Emergency Committee concerning Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 No entry screening was applied for Zika virus disease for a total of 10 months (january to October 2016) only Taiwan implemented entry screening on a routine basis for all inbound travelers for dengue and Chikungunya. in new Zealand, the Ministry of Health and the Auckland Regional Public Health Service were responsible for decision-making regarding the Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009, Zika virus disease and Dengue fever screening measures. a traveler contact information form collected contact details and information on location of stay that all inbound passengers were asked to fill in before arrival, when implementing entry screening for SARS [9]. Upon landing, all forms were collected from passengers by Health Canada personnel and retained for possible contact tracing if a health Canada monitored the spread of SARS via the WHO-Health Canada Global Public Health Intelligence Network and regular communications with other international and Canadian public health agencies. information of suspected cases was delivered to the local health bureaus via the Internet Information System for subsequent follow-up [33] in china information was entered into an internet-based surveillance system; all community hospitals were authorized to access the system. airport screening by airport clinicians Questionnaire Visual checks on board and at the terminal and temperature screening Infrared cameras Interview, questionnaire In-person assessment Ear thermometer Risk communication (video), information about seeking medical assistance Dengue NS1 antigen rapid test (at airport), blood and urine samples sent to the CDC\u2019s laboratory (flaviviruses) the large polymerase gene is targeted with an Altona commercial kit by diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany - Japan/airport/entry/Ebola virus disease/2014-2015 [38] At quarantine station, by immigration control officers Interview Questionnaire and temperature screening Ear thermometer - - - Information about seeking medical assistance.

Fujita et al. noted that during the incubation period, patients have no symptoms or high fever, it is almost impossible to identify patients by quarantine officers. ineffectiveness of screening measures to the high proportion of asymptomatic infected travelers, incubation of infections acquired before or during a flight, limitations of case definitions, and limitations of thermal scanning [21]. the annual cumulative number of Dengue importations identified at the airports (X) and the number of dengue importations reported from community clinics (Y) the number of dengue importations reported from community clinics (Y) has increased the proportion of imported cases identified by active surveillance, 48 (65.8%) of 73. Enhanced surveillance identified 812 individuals, 141 (18%) of whom had a history of international travel. 24 these 141 passengers picked up by enhanced surveillance had been developing symptoms on entry and were missed at screening. screening cannot detect incubating or asymptomatic travelers [24]. the prevalence of disease targeted by screening is very low among travelers. positive predictive values and the sensitivity of screening measures are expected to be very low for the diseases targeted through screening. the list of documents identified through the scoping search can be found in thematic sections and in alphabetical order. twenty-four articles in Appendix D were also identified through the systematic bibliographic review search. the de facto point of entry into the healthcare system for travelers with serious infectious diseases was found to be the in-country, acute care facilities (hospitals, clinics, and physicians\u2019 offices) the de facto point of entry into the healthcare system for travelers with serious infectious diseases was found to be the de facto point of entry into the healthcare system. ill persons from traveling by air S [25] Preserving public confidence S [8,9,29] Help avoiding major economic, social and international impact which even a single imported SARS case may have S [23] EVD May give to the public a false sense of security E [30] Investing in screening measures reduces the resources from other effective measures S [9,23]. results of systematic bibliographic review were used to develop algorithm for making evidence-based decisions in implementing entry and exit screening measures (Appendix E). results of systematic bibliographic review After full-text review the eligibility criteria were fulfilled by 27 articles (24 identified through databases searched and three after checking the reference lists of full-text articles). figures 2\u20134 summarize the results of studies reviewed including type of screening, point of entry (airports, ports, ground crossings), infectious disease targeted, and country of measure implementation. screening measures for dengue fever and Chikungunya infection were implemented as part of routine public health measures. all other screening measures were implemented on an ad hoc basis in response to public health emergencies. EVD [38] and Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 at airports [24,26,39]. Singapore applied entry screening for EVD at airports [36] and for SARS at airports, seaports and road entry points [23,29]. entry screening for dengue [7,10,11,15] and Chikungunya [7] were implemented as routine measures at airports. in the land borders of Guinea, liberia, and Sierra Leone, simple exit screening measures were applied for EVD [16] due to sparse, understaffed, and under-resourced official border points of entry, land borders were characterized as \u201cporous\u201d and it was not possible to apply measures similar to airports. it Screening (Timeframe of Implementation) On Travel Restrictions (Timeframe of Implementation) Ebola outbreak in Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) 10 May 2018/25 July 2018 No IHR Emergency Committee regarding the Ebola outbreak in 2018 Exit screening at airports (Mbandaka, Kinshasa) no countries should not close borders or restrict international traffic and trade.

61,118/1,249 [7] Taiwan 2003 to 2007 - - - 4119/539 [11] Taiwan July 2003 to June 2004 8,000,000 22,000 passengers were identified as fever patients. six out of 46 suspected cases identified through entry screening measures for SARS were diagnosed with atypical pneumonia or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with secondary infection or bronchopneumonia in Taiwan [35]. in australia, four hospitalized persons were ultimately given an alternative or undetermined diagnosis other than the initial targeted SARS [8]. five out of 21,083,404 inbound screened passengers were laboratory-confirmed cases of Zika virus disease. 130 cases of dengue fever and four cases of Chikungunya infection were found. none of the 27 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria systematically conducted a cost-effectiveness analysis for entry or exit screening measures. the cost of identifying dengue virus infections with airport fever screening is similar to that of other surveillance methods. the method is a cost-effective means of identifying imported Dengue cases. 77 out of 36,000 screened travelers were identified and denied boarding. health monitoring was performed for passengers arriving from affected countries. an entry card was given to all arriving passengers instructing them to consult with staff at public health centers in event of developing symptoms while in Japan. the authors of the 27 articles fulfilling the eligibility criteria attempted to assess the impact of screening measures or commented on the impact. the authors of the 27 articles fulfilling the current review attempted to assess the impact of screening measures or commented on the impact. the annual cumulative number of dengue importations identified at the airports (X) and the number of dengue importations reported from community clinics (Y) the number of dengue importations reported from community clinics (Y) has increased the proportion of imported cases identified by active surveillance, 48 (65.8%) of 73. health monitoring identified 8 infected individuals, 141 of whom had a history of international travel. 24 these 141 passengers picked up by enhanced surveillance had been developing symptoms on entry. self-reporting of exposure and symptoms in questionnaires relies on honesty of responder, language barriers exist, and fever symptoms can be concealed by antipyretic drug use. screening cannot detect incubating or asymptomatic travelers [24] and planning and resources are needed for possible high demand of laboratory tests. EVD is a disease with high pathogenicity and a very low number of asymptomatic cases. it is likely that additional cases would have been exported through air or sea travel without being detected by surveillance systems in the destination non-affected countries. the 2014/2015 outbreak spread through the population movement in the land borders of Guinea, liberia, and Sierra Leone. the primary objective of entry screening measures is to prevent or delay introduction of ill or incubating cases to a country. the primary objective of entry screening measures is to prevent or delay introduction of ill or incubating cases to a country. all countries should have the capacity to implement exit screening measures at points of entry. a survey conducted by WHO showed an aggregate rate of 4 confirmed cases per 1,000,000 screened travelers for Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in 10 countries. for EVD, no case was identified through entry screening measures [6,27,28,31,34,37,38], therefore the positive predictive value of entry screening is expected to be close to zero [9]. in japan, 6.6% (10/151) of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases were identified by airport entry screening [39]. the detection rate of dengue fever and Chikungunya infection was higher than that of influenza. entry screening for vector-borne diseases in Taiwan has been implemented on a routine basis for long periods of time. crossing land borders for sick, symptomatic persons may be easier than moving through air or sea means of transport. the density of populations crossing land borders can be very intense or not at all from place to place. countries where many official and unofficial crossing points exist may not be well prepared to respond. the inability of entry screening measures to identify cases of SARS in the 2003 outbreak was known during the public health emergencies that occurred the following years. decision-making during the influenza pandemic (H1N1) 2009 and the EVD epidemic in west africa in 2014/2015 seemed to be based on other reasons. study modeled the number of expected Ebola infected travelers exiting affected countries, the potential effect of air travel restrictions, and the efficiency of airport-based traveler screening at international points of entry and exit [55]. exit screening measures at three airports in the affected countries would be successful in assessing all potentially exposed or Ebola-affected travelers. entry screening should be part of a broader set of measures and different stakeholders need to cooperate. other issues for consideration are the identification of targeted travelers or itineraries at ports, airports, and ground crossings. 4.7. Limitations of the Bibliographic Review Research questions were answered based on published information. only articles in English, Dutch, German, and Greek were included in the review. bias could occur from the fact that most of the literature is about entry screening measures, rather than exit screening. EVD is a disease with high pathogenicity and a very low number of asymptomatic cases. an assessment of the impact of exit screening measures at ground crossings is much more challenging than at airports and seaports. it was not possible to apply at ground crossings the same protocols that were applied at airports and seaports. exit screening measures at borders may have played a role in discouraging ill or exposed persons from attempting to leave the affected countries. it is unknown how many cases would have been exported if exit screening measures at the points of entry of the affected countries would not have been implemented. all countries should be prepared to deal with unexpected events as laid down in the IHR 2005. entry screening measures for dengue fever and Chikungunya infection were implemented on a routine basis. the detection rate ranged from 0.01 to 2.2 confirmed cases per 10,000 screened travelers. EVD, no case was identified through entry screening measures. 12 out of 59 imported cases of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 were detected through entry screening within 54 days of entry screening. in japan, 6.6% (10/151) of Influenza Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases were identified by airport entry screening. the ECDC suggests that entry screening at airports in combination with exit screening could be of value, if exit screening measures are questionable and if the timeframe between departure and arrival at the destination country is long. the density of populations crossing land borders can be very intense or not at all from place to place. this fact should be considered by policy makers for preparedness planning. screening measures may have been implemented to relieve political and social pressure. countries should have the capacity to implement such measures. a mathematical model showed how different factors of six disease and outbreak characteristics and human behavior can affect screening measures\u2019 effectiveness. study modeled the number of expected Ebola infected travelers exiting affected countries, the potential effect of air travel restrictions, and the efficiency of airport-based traveler screening at international points of entry and exit [55] exit screening measures at three airports in the affected countries would be successful in assessing all potentially exposed or Ebola-affected travelers. pacities for entry and exit screening should be decided at airports. exit screening should take place before travelers deliver luggage at terminal. additional resources include capacities for laboratory diagnosis, quarantine, isolation, and treatment. the CDC evaluated the performance of NCITs, showing a sensitivity of 80\u201399% and a specificity of 75\u201399%. equipment calibration and accuracy checks according to manufacturers\u2019 instructions are essential during screening measure implementation. many other countries had implemented entry screening measures in response to the 2009 influenza pandemic on the European region. the current review suggests that there are difficulties in assessing the impact of border screening measures. the decision about the implementation of screening measures should be examined case-by-case. the decision about the implementation of screening measures should be examined on a case-by-case basis."}
