{"summary": "Clostridium difficile is an anaerobic, Gram-positive, spore forming rod shaped bacterium that can cause disease with a wide variety of symptoms, ranging from mild diarrhea to severe forms of pseudomembranous colitis [1]\u2013[3]. since 2004, numerous countries have reported outbreaks in health-care facilities caused by hypervirulent Type 027 [1]\u2013[6]. virulence factors of the enteropathogenic C. difficile are the two large clostri hypervirulent Types 027 and 078 have been shown to contain mutations in the tcdC gene, encoding the putative negative regulator of toxin gene transcription. the exponential growth phase of C. difficile has been reported to be associated with a high transcription level of the tcdC gene and low transcription levels of tcdR and the toxin genes. the stationary growth phase is associated with a low transcription level of the tcdC gene and high transcription levels of two studies have found increased levels of tcdC transcription in time. there is a great variability in toxin expression levels among (hyper) virulent strains. therefore, a minor role for TcdC in regulation of toxin expression was proposed. TY broth does not contain glucose and no cysteine was added. we verified that in TY broth earlier and higher expression of toxins was achieved. we successfully disrupted the tcdC gene in the region coding for the repressor domain using ClosTron technology. the primer EBS universal and tcdC2 generated a PCR product of 302 bp for the wild type and the CT::tcdC mutant. western blot analysis of TcdC production in wild type and CT::tcdC strain 8 hours post inoculation. the growth kinetics of the wild type and CT::tcdC strains showed no significant differences in various media tested. in TY broth, the wild type strain and the CT::tcdC strains showed an exponential growth phase in the first 8 hours post inoculation and after 12 hours post inoculation both strains entered into the stationary growth phase. the transcription levels of tcdR increased approximately 100-fold between 6 and 24 hours post inoculation. expression levels of tcdB, tcdE, tcdA and tcdC were on average 1.5-fold, 2.5-fold, 1.4-fold and 1.7-fold higher in the CT::tcdC strains compared to the wild type. this difference was not statistically significant (Figure 2A, all p values 0.088). the disruption of the tcdC gene does not result in a consistently and significantly increased transcription level of the PaLoc genes. we determined toxin levels using two independent assays. but found no consistent difference between wild type and mutant cells. total toxin amounts were quantified by using two independent assays. the supernatants were incubated in a ten fold dilutions series on vero cell monolayers. after 24 hrs the cytotoxic effects were quantified by determing the toxin end point titer. cdC gene in the region coding for the repressor domain using ClosTron technology. disruption was confirmed with conventional PCRs using the tcdC2 primer and the EBS universal primer. sequence analysis confirmed that the disruption was in the proposed repressor domain of the tcdC gene at the expected site. arrow indicates location of TcdC protein based on MW. cross-reaction of TcdC antibody with a protein of similar MW was also observed in Carter et al. [30]. the disruption of the tcdC gene had remained intact during our growth curves experiments. we compared the relative transcription levels of the PaLoc genes of wild type and CT::tcdC strains by reverse transcriptase quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) we found comparable transcription levels of all PaLoc genes in wild type and CT::tcdC strains. the transcription level of tcdB in the CT::tcdC1 strain is significantly higher compared to wild type level at 8 hours post inoculation. however, no significant differences are found between the wild type and CT::tcdC strains at any of the other time points. filter sterilized bacterial supernatants were incubated on a vero cell. after 24 hrs the cytotoxic effects were quantified by determing the toxin end point titer. supernatants of 12 and 24 hours post inoculation were 10 times diluted. the supernatants of 48 hours post inoculation were diluted 10 and 100 times. in the exponential growth phase (5 and 8 hours post inoculation) no toxins were detected. a frame shift mutation (117 bp) in tcdC, that results in a non-functional protein, is associated with increased toxin production in certain (hyper)virulent strains [15], [22]. a functional tcdC gene from a high toxin-producing strain that lacks any of the hyper virulence associated tcdC mutations (VPI10463, PCR ribotype 087) can reduce toxin expression levels and moderate the disruption of the tcdC gene did not affect the growth kinetics compared to the wild type strain. the rpsJ gene was selected for normalization, since rpsJ was overall the highest ranked reference gene regarding gene expression stability. the disruption of the tcdC gene resulted in an on average 1.7 fold higher transcription level of tcdC in time compared to the wild type strain. the disruption of the tcdC gene resulted in a slightly higher transcription level of the other PaLoc genes, although this was generally not significant. Clostridium difficile strain 630Erm is a derivative of the clinical isolate 630 [34], [35], a PCR ribotype 012 strain. PCR ribotypes 012 strains constitute 4% of the clinically isolated toxinogenic isolates in Europe [7] Clostridium difficile and Escherichia coli strains were grown anaerobically in a microaerobic cabinet at 37\u00b0C in pre-reduced 3% Bacto Tryptose (Difco), 2% Yeast extract (Difco) and 0.1% thioglycolate (pH 7.4) medium (TY) or Brain Heart Infusion broth (Oxoid) were serially diluted and pre-cultured (overnight) in samples for Western blot detection of TcdC were taken at 8, 12, 24 and 48 hours post inoculation. we routinely monitored the purity of the C. difficile cultures by culturing on appropriate agar plates. dC gene in the wild type strain 630erm was cloned using ClosTron technology. the retargeted intron was cloned using restriction enzymes BsrGI and HindIII into plasmids pMTL007C-E2. the verified plasmid (pDB001) was transformed to E. coli CA434. tcdC623as TGAACGCAAGTTTCTAATTTCGATTATAACTCGATAGAGGAAAGTGTCT This study EBS universal Intron mutagenesis/Control PCR/CGAAATTAGAAACTTGCGTTCAGTAAAC TGAACGTTTCTAATTTCTTTTTTTTT. tcdA probe Multiplex 1/FAM-ATCACTGACTTCTCCACCTATCCATACAA-BHQ-1 This study tcdC4 Multiplex 1/GGATATGATACTGGTATTACTTATGAC This study rspJ Forward GATCACAAGTTTCAGGACCTG This study oWKS-1131 AAAGCGATGCCGAGAATCTG This study Sal-R1 ATTACTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGT DNA was transferred onto a Hybond N+ filter (Amersham) in 10x saline sodium citrate (SSC) solution. the filter was washed in 2x SSC and baked at 80\u00b0C for 2 hours. prehybridization of the filter was done for 2 hrs at 60\u00b0C. bacterial pellets were centrifuged at low speed (3 min, 1000g, 4\u00b0C) to remove unbroken bacterial cells. pelleted membrane associated proteins were resuspended in 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4) and 5 mM EDTA. 1 ml Tri-pure was added to the lysed bacterial pellets and incubated for 5 min at 37\u00b0C. per 1 ml Tri-pure, 200 l chloroform was added and carefully shaken by hand for 3 min. RNA was precipitated by mixing the aqueous phase with 500 l isopropanol, followed by an incubation of 10 min at room temperature. random hexamers were used to convert 750 ng RNA into cDNA. synthesized cDNA was treated with RNase (Qiagen) for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and stored at 20\u00b0C. real-time qPCR to quantify reference gene rpsJ contained 25 l Hotstar mastermix (Qiagen), forward and reverse primers (80 nm each primer), 2.5 mM MgCl2, 100 nM of each probe and 2 l synthesized cDNA. real-time qPCR protocol included an enzyme activation step for 15 min at 95\u00b0C, followed by 50 cycles of amplification. a 2-fold dilution of each tested time point (5, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hpi) was pre-incubated with a 1/100 diluted anti-toxin (Techlab) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the incubated bacterial supernatants were aspirated off after one hour and replaced with 100 l cell culture medium. se (Difco), Yeast extract (Difco) and 0.1% thioglycolate (pH 7.4) medium (TY) were supplemented with 0.5% yeast extract and 0.01% L-cysteine (Sigma) (BHIS) when required, the broths were supplemented with appropriated antibiotics. the broths were serially diluted and pre-cultured (overnight) in pre-reduced TY broth. tcdC negative, tcdC negative, PaLoc negative, LincomycinR, tcdC623as. retargeted intron was cloned using restriction enzymes BsrGI and HindIII into plasmids pMTL007C-E2. the verified plasmid was transformed to E. coli CA434. phenicol (Sigma; 10 g/ml) and C. difficile selective supplement (Oxoid) followed by several rounds of subculturing on pre-reduced BHIS agar supplemented with lincomycin (Sigma; 20 g/ml) and C. difficile selective supplement (Oxoid) this study tcdR probe Multiplex 1/TEX-TATGACCTGAACCTTCTCCATTCTCC-BHQ-2 This study tcdB forward Multiplex 1/TEX-TATGACCTGAACCACCTTCTCC-BHQ-2 This study tcdE Forward Multiplex 2/AAATATACATGCTATCATTGCTAC This study tcdE probe Multiplex 2/FAM-TGATTCCTCCATCTCTATTCCAAAACTAGAA- complemented mutant strains are expected to be comparable to wild type and tcdC mutant strains. complemented mutant strains are expected to be comparable to wild type and tcdC mutant strains. Western blots antibodies against TcdC were generated by immunizing rabbits with a synthetic peptide (CQLARTPDDYKYKKV) this epitope is located before the Clostron insertion site, and would therefore also be expected to detect truncated TcdC protein. membranes were probed with the pre incubated TcdC antibody and an antibody against the subunit of the E. coli F0F1 ATPase that cross reacts with the homologous protein in C. difficile [20], [43] the probed membranes were analyzed using secondary anti-mouse horse radish peroxidase conjugated antibodies (Dako), a chemiluminescence detection kit and a Typhoon 9410 scanner. the precipitated RNA was collected by centrifugation (12,000g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in 100 l DNase/RNase free water. the re-precipitated RNA was washed once with 80% ethanol and dissolved in 50 l DNase/RNase free water. real-time multiplex qPCR amplification of the PaLoc and reference genes was performed on a CFX96 real-time PCR detection system. the efficiencies of the PaLoc and reference genes were determined using serially diluted genomic DNA (standard curve) the manually calculated efficiencies and the reference gene rpsJ were used to normalize the expression levels of the PaLoc genes. the supernatants of culture samples (1 mL) were collected after centrifugation (30 min, 3000g, 4\u00b0C), filter sterilized (0.45 M cellulose acetate membrane) and stored at 4\u00b0C. a 2-fold dilution of each tested time point (5, 8, 12, 24 and 48 hr) was pre-incubated with a 1/100 diluted anti-toxin (Techlab) for 1 hr at 37\u00b0C and 5% the end-point titer was defined as the first dilution at which the Vero Cell morphology was indistinguishable from the neutralized 2-fold diluted supernatants. an independent sample t-test was employed to compare the strains at different time points."}
