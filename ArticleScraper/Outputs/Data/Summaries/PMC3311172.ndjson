{"summary": "the first cohort comprised 2,562 specimens sent during 1998\u20132008. the second cohort comprised 3,960 specimens collected during 1982\u20132008. the third cohort comprised 348 specimens from hospitalized children with clinical meningitis or encephalitis. in 1 of 10 myocardium specimens, hCV was detected by nested RT-PCR. results of quantitative real-time RT-PCR were negative. no histopathologic alterations could be observed in myocardial tissue from the same patient. the closest known relative to both viruses was a strain obtained in the Netherlands in 2008. the closest relative of both viruses was a strain obtained in the Netherlands in 2008. formal and final virus typing is pending because VP1 regions could not be sequenced from 2 viruses. an enterovirus was co-detected by real-time RT-PCR in CSF and feces. a rhinovirus was co-detected at low concentrations (real-time RT-PCR threshold cycle value >40), most compatible with shedding after previous respiratory infection. a low detection rate in CSF does not contradict a general potential of these viruses to cause meningoencephalitis. the high human seroprevalence against hCV (12) will complicate epidemiologic studies. but investigations of links between hCV and SIDS are highly justified."}
