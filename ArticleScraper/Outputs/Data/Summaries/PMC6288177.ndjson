{"summary": "the genus Flavivirus within the Flaviviridae virus family comprises almost 70 reported species including the most studied yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus (DENV), Zika virus (ZIKV), West Nile virus (WNV), Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and tick-borne TBEV. the only available vaccine shows limited efficacy against all DENV serotypes and safety concerns have recently arisen in the Philippines. flavivirus vRNA is an exciting and excellent model for investigating the spatiotemporal regulation of RNA metabolism. vRNA is composed of a 5\u2032UTR, one single open reading frame and a 3\u2032UTR. vRNA encodes an endoplasmic reticulum-associated transmembrane polyprotein. in local pseudoknots and long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions, vRNA translation, synthesis and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in time and space. vRNA translation, synthesis and encapsidation must be tightly coordinated in both time and space. flaviviruses, like the vast majority (if not all) of positive-strand RNA viruses, induce massive rearrangements of ER membranes to create a replication-favorable microenvironment. they are believed to spatially segregate the different steps of the viral life cycle. however, there remains a knowledge gap regarding the fate of the vRNA in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. the viral 5\u2032UTR and 3\u2032UTR have been demonstrated to engage in interactions with both host and viral proteins. the 3\u2032UTR can be sub-divided into three sub-domains: (1) a highly variable region located immediately after the stop codon, which is implicated in viral adaptation to the host. for efficient genome replication, the genome adopts a circularized structure. iral genome contains a cap structure at the 5\u2032 end which enables translation through canonical translation initiation. addition of the cap is mediated by NS5 protein\u2019s methyltransferase activity in combination with the nucleotide triphosphatase activity of NS3. NS3 removes a phosphate from the 5\u2032 terminus of the vRNA and NS5 catalyzes the addition of guanosine monophosphate (GM mRNA containing the DENV2 5\u2032UTR, the first 72 nt of capsid coding sequence and the 3\u2032UTR in a dose-dependent manner. this suggests that PABP/3\u2032UTR interaction mimics the role of mRNA poly-A tail and presumably stimulates translation initiation. however, the 3\u2032SL structure independently influences translation after cap binding by the small 40S ribosomal subunit. cleotide sequences PK1 and PK2 downstream of each DB. similar structures have also been reported for other flaviviruses. TL1 and TL2 are important for flavivirus translation. expression knockdown of eIF4E in hamster BHK-21 or monkey Vero cells led to 60% decrease in total cellular protein synthesis. DENV NS5 protein levels decreased by just 10%. no IRES has been identified for flaviviruses. stresses can induce translational arrest associated with polysome disassembly. formation of SGs requires phosphorylation of eIF2 by protein kinase R (PKR) eIF2 inhibits global protein translation by reducing levels of the eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet ternary complex. eIF2-specific SG components T cell internal antigen-1 (TIA-1) and TIAR are diverted by flaviviruses to regulate replication. these host factors colocalize with viral proteins and dsRNA within the replication complex. vRNA replication is the core step leading to virus amplification and consists of de novo RNA synthesis. NS5 synthesizes first one molecule of negative-strand intermediate RNA. NS5 requires both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs to initiate negative-strand RNA synthesis. NS5 interacts with the top loop of the 3\u2032SL which is highly conserved across the Flavivirus genus. vRNA-bound NS5 molecules would be transferred from neosynthetized vRNA to the 3\u2032 end of the negative-strand. this is consistent with a study that indicated a greater affinity of NS5 for the 3\u2032 end of the negative-strand RNA than for vRNA 3\u2032UTR. other RNA secondary structures in the 3\u2032UTR have also been reported to influence replication. NS3 helicase activity is most likely involved in vRNA synthesis from the negative strand. neosynthesized positive-strands can be translated or packaged into assembling viral particles. vRNA shows a high structural plasticity with ample evidence. evidence of individual molecules of circularized DENV vRNA has been provided in vitro. they are composed of 8 or more nucleotides located in the 5\u2032 region of the capsid-coding sequence and in the 3\u2032UTR. CSs were first identified in WNV and have been demonstrated to be essential for flaviviral replication in BHK-21 cells. the 5\u2032 region of the genome (5\u2032DAR) is involved in DENV replication and possibly also RNA cyclization. the 3\u2032DAR sequence mapping to the 5\u2032 stem of sHP is complementary to the 5\u2032DAR. sHP harboring mutations in the stem of this structure replicates less efficiently than wild-type virus. changes in the dCS sequence composition affects the formation of the 5\u2032-3\u2032 long range RNA-RNA interactions. dCS and DCS-PK contribute to the function of the cyclization unit containing 5\u2032UAR, 5\u2032CS, 5\u2032DAR, and cHP. a structure present downstream SLA in the 5\u2032UTR has been identified as an important riboswitch. the circularization of vRNA induced a decrease in affinity of NS5 for the 5\u2032UTR. this would favor NS5 transfer to the 3\u2032UTR. this would properly positioning the polymerase for negative-strand RNA synthesis. in mammalian cells, their diameter is approximately 90 nm and they are connected to the cytoplasm by a 10 nm-wide pore. in the case of WNV and TBEV, vesicles within the same ER cisternae are also connected to each other by pore-like openings suggesting that they exchange material. vRNA is proposed to exit VPs through a pore to be directly encapsidated. vRNA is partially degraded by cellular XRN1 which generate sfRNA. sfRNA regulates several host responses including innate immunity at the levels of signal transduction and ISG translation. transmembrane proteins NS1, NS4A and NS4B are believed to be implicated in the formation of RFs. NS1 was shown to alter liposome membrane in vitro. NS3 helicase domain associates with cytosolic loop of NS4B transmembrane protein. NS4B mutants that lose the capacity to interact with NS3 are defective in replication. NS4B was shown to promote the dissociation of NS3 from single-stranded RNA. NS4B homodimerizes and interacts with both NS1 and NS4A. AUF1 destabilizes SLB and the 3\u2032 SL thereby exposing the UAR circularization elements. this illustrates that host factors are able to impact viral genome plasticity and to regulate important riboswitches in the flavivirus life cycle. dechtawewat et al., 2015; Phillips et al., 2016 hnRNP D/AUF-1 ZIKV/DENV/WNV Proviral Replication 5\u2032UTR (SLB) + 3\u2032UTR (3\u2032SL) Friedrich et al., 2018 hnRNP G/RBMX DENV Proviral Translation/replication\" vRNA replication relies on RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of flaviviral NS5 protein, through an asymmetric process. vRNA replication relies on the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity of flaviviral NS5 protein, through an asymmetric process. NS5 requires both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032UTRs to initiate negative-strand RNA synthesis. the vRNA must adopt a circularized panhandle-shaped structure. NS5 interacts with the top loop of the 3\u2032SL. vRNA-bound NS5 molecules would be directly transferred from neosynthetized vRNA to the 3\u2032 end of the negative-strand. this is consistent with a study that indicated a greater affinity of NS5 for the 3\u2032 end of the negative-strand RNA than for vRNA 3\u2032UTR. other RNA secondary structures in the 3\u2032UTR have also been reported to influence replication. NS3 helicase activity is most likely involved in vRNA synthesis from the negative strand. it is unclear which exact step of vRNA synthesis it regulates in infected cells. neosynthesized positive-strands can be translated or packaged into assembling viral particles. evidence of individual molecules of circularized DENV vRNA has been provided in vitro using atomic force microscopy. one of the main cyclization elements involved in this process is the \u201cconserved sequences\u201d (CS) they are composed of 8 or more nucleotides located in the 5\u2032 region of the capsid-coding sequence and in the 3\u2032UTR. the 3\u2032DAR sequence mapping to the 5\u2032 stem of sHP is complementary to the 5\u2032DAR. sHP has been demonstrated to be implicated in long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions, with a major contribution from the UAR-containing stem. mutations in the 3\u2032 DAR sequence would rather influence the stability and/or the formation of sHP. an RNA motif termed \u201cdownstream of 5\u2032 CS pseudoknot\u201d (DCS-PK) also enhances replication in BHK-21 cells by regulating circularization. this tertiary interaction localizes to the capsid-coding region and appears to be constituted by a three-stem pseudoknot structure. the circularization of vRNA induced the melting of the UFS structure. this led to a decrease in affinity between NS5 and the 5\u2032UTR. this would favor NS5 transfer to the 3\u2032UTR, hence properly positioning the polymerase for negative-strand RNA synthesis. the determinants of both types of pores are completely unknown. VPs contain dsRNA, the replication intermediate as well as several viral non-structural proteins absolutely required for replication. however, it remains unclear if VPs are absolutely required for replication. vRNA is proposed to exit VPs through a pore to be directly encapsidated. vRNA is partially degraded by cellular XRN1 which generate sfRNA. sfRNA regulates several host responses including innate immunity at the levels of signal transduction and ISG translation. only NS5 and NS3 possess enzymatic activities. the transmembrane proteins NS1, NS4A and NS4B are implicated in the formation of RFs. NS4B was shown to promote the dissociation of NS3 from single-stranded RNA. it would indirectly stimulate the recruitment of the helicase toward newly formed replication intermediates. NS4B homodimerizes and interacts with both NS1 and NS4A. AUF1 destabilizes SLB and the 3\u2032 SL thereby exposing the UAR circularization elements. host factors are able to impact viral genome plasticity and to regulate important riboswitches in the flavivirus life cycle. Phillips et al., 2016 hnRNP D/AUF-1 ZIKV/DENV/WNV Proviral Replication 5\u2032UTR (SLB) + 3\u2032UTR (3\u2032SL) Friedrich et al., 2014; Friedrich et al., 2018 hnRNP G/RBMX DENV Proviral Translation/replication. vRNA packaging During virus assembly, the vRNA genome must be encapsidated. only vRNA is encapsidated while cellular RNA and viral negative-strand intermediate RNA must be excluded from the capsid. the highly basic viral capsid protein binds with high affinity to the negatively charged vRNA in what is presumed to be a rather non-specific manner. capsid molecules far outnumber the copies of vRNA in the virion, vRNA packaging must be regulated to achieve optimal vRNA intraviral stoichiometry. a contribution of CCR1 in vRNA packaging was ruled out by the authors. a putative reduction of vRNA packaging may have been masked by the presence of non-encapsidated newly synthesized vRNA in the cell supernatants. a possible role of CCR1 in vRNA packaging should likely be re-evaluated. cellular YTHDF proteins that inhibit infectious particle production correlate with redistribution of YTHDF proteins to lipid droplets. this did not influence the vRNA replication process. this strongly suggests that N6A methylation specifically regulates virus assembly. flaviviral C protein accumulation on lipid droplets is important for the generation of infectious virus particles. but this pool of structural proteins may represent a storage compartment for assembly competent capsid rather than the actual site of genome selection and particle assembly. vRNA replication and packaging processes are coordinated in time and space. the newly synthesized positive-strand genome molecule would exit the VP through the pore and be directly encapsidated into budding virions. this implies that the replication process and/or the presence of VPs would be required for vRNA encapsidation and envelopment by the ER membrane. a fraction of DENV NS1 is associated with virions. mutants of the NS1 -ladder domain lost their ability to indirectly associate with capsid while their interaction with glycoproteins E and prM was maintained. NS2A also has an influence on both RNA replication and viral particle production. case domain was shown to possess an RNA annealing activity in vitro. this suggests that through specific interactions with the vRNA, NS3 might promote the exposure of a putative packaging motif. this regulation might also involve a contribution of assembling virions since NS3 possesses an RNA chaperoning activity in vitro. hnRNP K, DDX6 or DDX3 were reported to also associate with the genome of HCV. some of them have been reported to regulate the equilibrium between HCV RNA replication and the production of infectious viral particles. flaviviruses hijack the function of several host RNA-binding proteins during vRNA encapsidation. flaviviruses control genome selection for encapsidation. flaviviral RNA can be sensed as foreign RNA by the cell. this first line of defense involves RNA sensors that trigger a signaling cascade leading to the production of interferons. TLR3 knockout mice are more susceptible to lethal WNV infection. RIG-I belongs to the RIG-I-like receptor (RLR) family. it targets specifically dsRNA and the 5\u2032 tri/diphosphate moiety of short structured uncapped RNAs. cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS)/stimulator of IFN genes (STING) pathway is activated upon RNA virus infection (including DENV and WNV) and induces type I IFN production. the relevance of this pathway to flavivirus infection is highlighted by several evidence that DENV NS2B and NS3 are able to counteract the functions of cGAS and STING. vRNA modification may confer the vRNA with the ability to be marked as \u201cself\u201d and evade recognition by host sensors of foreign RNA. vRNA methylation and innate immunity Interestingly, several studies have shown that vRNA modifications may confer the vRNA with the ability to be marked as \u201cself\u201d and evade recognition by host sensors. the pathogenicity of this mutant virus in vivo was restored in mice harboring a deficiency in type I interferon signaling. this strongly supports the idea that 2\u2032-O-methylation is crucial to evade the type I IFN-dependent antiviral response. mutant and wild-type viruses induce comparable levels of IFNs. overexpression of IFIT1 in 293-DC-SIGN cells only partially inhibited the replication of DENV2 2\u2032-O MTase mutant. this highlights that the 2-O-methylation of vRNA allows evasion from innate immunity. role of virus-mediated 2\u2032-O-methylation as a countermeasure against innate immunity has also been recognized in mouse and human coronaviruses. sfRNA Against Innate Immunity During the infection, the accumulation of viral genome generates several by-products which do not encode viral proteins. sfRNA is a highly structured 0.3\u20130.7 kb-long non-coding RNA (sfRNA) it is well established that sfRNA is produced by an incomplete 5\u2032-3\u2032 degradation of the viral genome by the cellular XRN1/Pacman exonuclease. XRN1 is stalled at the 3\u2032UTR extremity, more precisely at stem-loops/pseudoknots of the highly variable region upstream the DB structures causing the accumulation of different species of sfRNA. sfRNA contributes to viral cytopathicity both in cellulo and in vivo. mutations inhibiting sfRNA production lead to a decrease in the viral replication in cells that possess functional type I IFN responses. a recent study shows that DENV sfRNA negatively impacts IFN induction through the inhibition of TRIM25. the determinants of the viral genome governing the abundance of sfRNA appear to be the same in insect and mammalian cells. however, in mosquitos, the sfRNA causes disruption of the innate immune response by inhibiting the Toll receptor pathway. this appears to be mediated by the association of sfRNA with Dicer and Ago2, two essential proteins of the RNAi machinery. amplification, flaviviral RNA can be sensed as foreign RNA by the cell. it triggers antiviral innate immunity in mammalian cells. ISGs are antiviral effectors that may be secreted as proinflammatory cytokines. cytosolic PRR targets specifically dsRNA and the 5\u2032 tri/diphosphate moiety of short structured uncapped RNAs. it also has affinity for the polyuridine tract of HCV 3\u2032UTR. treatment of cells or mice with U-rich 5\u2032ppp-based agonists protect from infection with variety of viruses. vRNA most likely replicates within VPs, constituting a confined environment providing limited access to cytosolic vRNA sensors. deNV NS2B and NS3 are able to counteract the functions of cGAS and STING. this also implies an adaptation from the pathogens in order to evade innate immunity. modifications may confer the vRNA with the ability to be marked as \u201cself\u201d and evade recognition by host sensors of foreign RNA. NS5 also possesses a 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase activity. modifications occur specifically at the 2\u2032-OH position of adenosine residues. the pathogenicity of this mutant virus in vivo was restored in mice harboring a deficiency in type I interferon signaling. mutant and wild-type viruses induce comparable levels of IFNs suggesting that WNV vRNA sensing by RLR or TLR3 is not involved in this evasion strategy. 2\u2032-O MTase-deficient viruses induced a stronger type I IFN response. coronaviral replication was restored upon suppression of IFNAR or cytosolic RNA sensor MDA5 expression suggesting that 2\u2032-O methylation of the coronavirus RNA directly evades early RNA sensing by MDA5. the action of sfRNA Against Innate Immunity During the infection, the accumulation of viral genome generates several by-products which do not encode viral proteins. three classes of non-coding RNAs have been described to date: viral small RNAs (vsRNAs), defective interfering genomes (DIGs) XRN1 is required for sfRNA production, but sfRNA is also able to sequester this cellular protein and to inhibit its endogenous functions. in 293T cells, this results in the accumulation of uncapped cellular mRNAs in the cytosol. despite its high levels in the cytosol, sfRNA does not appear to play a direct role in replication. a recent study shows that DENV sfRNA negatively impacts IFN induction through the inhibition of TRIM25, an E3 ubiquitin ligase required for RIG-I activation. the decrease in IFN induction is consistent with an impairment in TRIM25-mediated polyubiquitylation and subsequent activation of RIG-I. sfRNA plays an important role in flaviviral life cycle and dissemination in infected insects. determinants of the viral genome governing abundance of sfRNA appear to be the same in insect and mammalian cells. sfRNA downregulates the RNA interference (RNAi) machinery, the main mediator of innate immunity in insects. deficient viruses are severely attenuated and do not properly spread in cell lines that possess a functional IFN response system. pathogenicity of this mutant virus in vivo was restored in mice harboring a deficiency in type I interferon signaling. this strongly supports the idea that 2\u2032-O-methylation is crucial to evade the type I IFN-dependent antiviral response. methylation-dependent antiviral effect was attributed to IFN-induced proteins with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) replication and pathogenicity of WNV E218A mutant virus was rescued and comparable to wild-type virus in Ifit1 knockout mice. suppression of type I IFN receptor (IFNAR) or cytosolic RNA sensor MDA5 expression suggests that 2\u2032-O methylation of the coronavirus RNA directly evades early RNA sensing by MDA5. a recent study has demonstrated that a DENV E216A 2\u2032-O MTase-deficient mutant induced an early innate immune response after just a few hours of infection. sfRNA is a highly structured 0.3\u20130.7 kb-long non-coding RNA. sfRNA is produced by an incomplete 5\u2032-3\u2032 degradation of the viral genome by the cellular XRN1/Pacman exonuclease. XRN1 is required for sfRNA production, but sfRNA is also able to sequester this cellular protein and to inhibit its endogenous functions. in 293T cells, this results in the accumulation of uncapped cellular mRNAs in the cytosol. the consequences of such inhibition are still unclear and remain to be further deciphered. the decrease in IFN induction is consistent with an impairment in TRIM25-mediated polyubiquitylation and subsequent activation of RIG-I. sfRNA overexpression in infected cells inhibits IRF3 phosphorylation and its nuclear translocation. sfRNA plays a role in ISG expression at the post-transcriptional level. sfRNA downregulates the RNAi machinery, the main mediator of innate immunity in insects. mutants in DENV and WNV decreasing the production of sfRNA showed an impairment in RNAi suppression. this appears to be mediated by the association of sfRNA with Dicer and Ago2. flavivirus-induced cytopathic effects rely on the modulation of these signaling cascades. mice infected with full length sfRNA-deficient WNV all survive in contrast to the usual 100% mortality rate with wild-type WNV. this did not correlate with defects in virus dissemination in the brain and spleen confirming that sfRNA is crucial for pathogenicity in vivo. vRNA methylation on specific nucleotides impacts vRNA tertiary structure formation, cyclization and/or affinity for host RNA-binding proteins, and vice-versa. a precise understanding of the dynamic control of vRNA in the flavivirus life cycle will hopefully identify potential therapeutic targets for development of antivirals.
