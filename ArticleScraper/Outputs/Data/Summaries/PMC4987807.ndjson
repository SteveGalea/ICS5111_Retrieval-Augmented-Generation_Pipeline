{"summary": "the first outbreak was reported in the region of Ash Sharqiyah in April to May 2013 followed by an outbreak in Riyadh in July to September 2013. the largest outbreak in March to May 2014 principally affected Makkah region (mostly Jeddah) and Riyadh. a cluster is defined as a group of cases who were treated, diagnosed, and/or tested in the same hospital. within-cluster reproduction number at a point in time is a declining function of the cumulative number of cases that have accrued in the cluster by that time. we estimate that, after 10 cases, the within-cluster reproduction number is on average 47% (95% CI: 34%, 63%) of its initial value. from 0.5 (95% CI: 0.2, 0.8) reported cases per week infected by the animal reservoir in early 2013 to 2.1 (95% CI: 1.0, 3.6) in mid-2014. the model satisfyingly reproduces the distribution of the number of cases (Fig. 3A), of the number of clusters (Fig. 3B), and of the size of these clusters (Fig. 3 C\u2013F). Fig. 4 shows the time series of the reconstructed cumulative number of cases by source of infection. it suggests that infections from the reservoir have occurred repeatedly over the study period. within-cluster infections are concentrated in time during three substantial outbreaks that occurred in May 2013, September 2013 and March to May 2014. we studied the spatiotemporal clustering of MERS-CoV cases in the country that has been the most affected by MERS-CoV. the framework we developed made it possible to analyze all surveillance data in a coherent and integrated manner. the analysis has resulted in a more holistic characterization of MERS-CoV epidemiology in KSA. a majority of MERS-CoV cases (88%) reported during this time period were due to human-to-human transmission. one can perform thorough epidemiological investigations of MERS-CoV patients to ascertain their likely source of infection. one can perform thorough epidemiological investigations of MERS-CoV patients to ascertain their likely source of infection. seven sequences isolated during the 2014 Riyadh outbreak were found to be largely homogeneous, all falling within a single clade (4). the analysis of surveillance data makes it possible to get a more comprehensive picture of MERS-CoV transmission across KSA for an 19-mo time period. evolutionary theory suggests pathogens that are most at risk for evolving high levels of transmissibility are those that are already moderately transmissible. our approach, like other methods that reconstruct the transmission tree from case data, can quantify trends in the effective reproduction number. however, more detailed models and data are needed to decipher mechanisms explaining these trends. we modeled temporal variations in introductions from the reservoir with a Poisson distribution that had a time-varying mean. however, introductions may occur in clumps. we found this had little impact on our estimates. 102 cases from the hospital with the largest number of cases were excluded from the hospital with the largest number of cases. parameter estimates for the baseline analysis and an analysis that excludes 102 cases from the hospital. 59%) Within region 23% (20%, 27%) 26% (21%; 30%) Between region 5% (2%, 8%) 5% (0.2%, 10%) Reservoir 12% (9%, 15%) 13% (10%, 16%) Table S3. Parameter estimates for the baseline analysis where the daily number of introductions follows a Poisson distribution. in a number of nosocomial outbreaks, a large proportion of cases had comorbidities (3, 5) that have been suggested to increase susceptibility to infection or disease severity. another possibility is that certain aerosolizing medical procedures in hospitals facilitate spread. region RR 0.24 (0.19, 0.29) 0.22 (0.17, 0.29) Between region RO 0.05 (0.02, 0.09) 0.04 (0.004, 0.09) Risk of introduction from reservoir Nb at start of study period (weekly) 0.5 (0.2, 0.8) 0.4 (0.2, 0.7) Nb at end of study period (weekly) 2.1 (1.0, 3.6) 2.4 (1.2, 3.9) Exponential growth rate (daily) 0.003 ( 0.2 (0.2, 0.7) Nb at end of study period (weekly) 2.1 (1.0, 3.6) 2.1 (1.1, 3.6) Exponential growth rate (daily) 0.003 (0.001, 0.005) 0.003 (0.001, 0.005) Source of infection, % Within cluster 60% (57%, 63%) 56% (53%, 59%) Within region 23% (20%, 27%) 26% (21%; 30%) Between region 5% (2%, 8%) 0.003 (0.001, 0.005) 0.002 (0.000, 0.004) Source of infection, % Within cluster 60% (57%, 63%) 60% (57%, 63%) Within region 23% (20%, 27%) 24% (20%, 28%) Between region 5% (2%, 8%) 6% (3%, 9%) Reservoir 12% (9%, 15%) 10% (7%, 13%) Materials and Methods Data. a cluster is defined as a group of cases who were treated, diagnosed, and/or tested in the same hospital, with a time lag between two consecutive cases of at least 21 d. the cluster is defined as a group of cases who were treated, diagnosed, and/or tested in the same hospital. the data are available in Dataset S1. Modeling the Risk of MERS-CoV Infection. the reproduction number R (i.e., the mean number of secondary cases generated by a human case) is decomposed into mutually exclusive categories arising from within-cluster transmission (RC), from within-region transmission (RR, i.e., transmission to other clusters of the region) and from between-region transmission (RO, i.e., transmission to clusters of other regions) we denote s the proportion of secondary cases with onset date s days after the onset date of the infecting case. we assume the serial interval has a Gamma distribution with a mean and SD that are estimated from the data. we assume that the within-cluster reproduction number at the start of the cluster R C c ( 0 ) is drawn from a Gamma distribution with mean R C and SD C that are estimated from the data. this decay could be due to control measures and/or other factors such as the natural depletion of susceptible individuals. we assume that the within-cluster reproduction number varies from cluster to cluster. we assume that the within-cluster reproduction number depends on the cumulated number of cases in the cluster. if case n was infected by a human case, s n is equal to the ID of the infector; otherwise, s n = 0. with this information, the number of secondary cases of the different types is known for each case n. the first line gives the probability of the number of secondary cases. the second line gives the probability a secondary case will end up in a given hospital. the third line gives the density of the generation time distribution. a standard Metropolis Hastings step is performed to update parameters on the log scale (22). Update of the source of infection of case i is implemented. each possible source n is allocated the weight. c i = c i c n, q i = q n ( s i = n ), R O, n = i : q i q n ( s i = n ), where ( s i = n ) = 1 if s i = n and 0 otherwise. second line gives probability a secondary case will end up in a given hospital. the likelihood is as follows: L = L cluster t L t intro n L n trans. in practice, the source of infection s n of case n is unobserved. the proposal probability that the source of case i is source n is as follows: p n = w n / j w j. Implementation. the algorithm is run for 100,000 iterations with a burn in of 5,000. one run with 100,000 iterations takes about 30 min on a desktop. the algorithm is run for 100,000 iterations with a burn in of 5,000. one run with 100,000 iterations takes about 30 min on a desktop. analysis is restricted to the n = 495 cases detected through passive surveillance. in the main analysis, we consider n = 681 human MERS-CoV infections detected in KSA through passive (n = 495) and active surveillance (n = 186) analysis is restricted to the n = 495 cases detected through passive surveillance and distributed across 89 hospitals. analysis is restricted to the n = 495 cases detected through passive surveillance and distributed across 89 hospitals. the first line of the spreadsheet provides the ID of the hospital. the second line of the spreadsheet provides the region of the hospital. each cell contains the number of cases with onset in a specific hospital."}
