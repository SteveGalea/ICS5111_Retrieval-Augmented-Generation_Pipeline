{"summary": "the outermost layer is composed of two proteins: VP7, which forms the smooth surface of the virus, and the spike protein VP4. VP4 is cleaved by trypsin into two subunits, VP8 and VP5, and this cleavage is required for the virus to enter the cell (3\u20137) the switch from Rab5 to Rab7 occurs via formation of hybrid endosomes that carry both Rab GTPases in separate domains. these endosomes also involve the presence of intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are formed by the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery. the maturation process of late endosomes also involves a drop in the luminal pH and calcium concentration. docytic compartments from EEs have been defined as early-penetrating (E-P) viruses. those that reach LEs have been defined as late-penetrating (L-P) viruses. a collection of UK RRV reassortant viruses differ in the endocytic mechanism employed for cell internalization. rhesus monkey epithelial cell line MA104 and the murine fibroblast L929 cell line (ATCC) were grown in advanced Eagle's minimal essential medium (MEM; Invitrogen) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. RRV variant Nar3 and its revertants, clones 14 and 18 (revertant Nar3-14 [rNar3-14] and revertant Nar3-18 [rNar3-18]) were RV WI-61 (clone 3; G3P[2]) was obtained from F. H. Clark (Wistar Institute, Philadelphia, PA) through M. K. Estes. porcine strain YM (G11P[7]) was isolated in our laboratory. hyperimmune sera to purified RV particles (anti-TLPs), RV nonstructural protein 5 (anti-NSP5) and purified reovirus particles (anti-Reo) were produced in our laboratory. paraformaldehyde (PFA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), Triton X-100, and cathepsin B inhibitor (CA-074) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO) plasmids expressing vacuolar protein sorting 4 homolog A (VPS4A) and DN CFP-VPS4A-E228Q were purchased from Dharmacon-Thermo Scientific (Pittsburg, PA) the indicated plasmids were transfected into MA104 cells as previously described (38, 40) the plasmid transfection efficiency was about 50%. cell monolayers were subsequently fixed, and infected cells were detected as described previously (36). the detection of viral antigen was optimal at these times postinfection with the immunochemical staining used. both immunoperoxidase and immunofluorescent assays gave essentially the same results when the infectivity of the viruses was determined. 80% of infected cells were lipofected with the indicated siRNAs. confluent cells were then washed twice and incubated with MEM for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cell monolayers were fixed at 14 or 16 hpi (for RV or reovirus infection, respectively), cells were washed with MEM. none of the cell treatments with protease inhibitors were cytotoxic. cells were lysed in Laemmli sample buffer and denatured by boiling for 5 min. the cell lysate samples were then subjected to SDS-PAGE. the membranes were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) or phosphate-buffered saline containing 5% nonfat dry milk before they were incubated. the RRV strain (G3P[3]), BRV UK strain (G6P[5]) and UK RRV reassortants used in this work were donated by Y. Hoshino (NIAID, NIH, Bethesda, MD) monoclonal antibodies were used for detection of cellular proteins. Rab5a, EEA1, and Rab7a antibodies were purchased from abcam. mouse monoclonal antibody against LBPA was purchased from Molecular Probes. plasmids encoding Cdc42 (cell division control protein 42 homolog), Cdc42N17, and Cdc42V12 proteins fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) were a gift from F. Sanchez-Madrid (Universidad Aut\u00f3noma de Madrid, Madrid, Spain) plasmids expressing cyan fluorescent protein (CFP)-labeled hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate ( at 72 hpt, the cells were washed twice with MEM and subsequently infected with the indicated RV strain. none of the assayed siRNAs was cytotoxic at the concentrations used. infection was determined by either immunoperoxidase or immunofluorescence focus-forming assays. infected cells were fixed at 6 h postinfection (hpi) and prepared for immunofluorescence. infected cells were detected by incubation for 1 h at room temperature. coverslips were mounted on glass slides using fluorescence microscope. cells were washed twice, incubated at 37\u00b0C in MEM for 6 h. cells were mock treated for assays with leupeptin and cathepsin inhibitors. indicated virus was then adsorbed for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in presence of the inhibitor. primary antibodies (monoclonal antibodies to EEA1, Rab7, or Rab9 or anti-TLP antibodies) and secondary antibodies were incubated as previously described (40). ESCRT protein HRS was fused to CFP for its detection. each colocalization assay was performed in duplicate cover glasses. the VP6 RV gene was amplified using forward and reverse primers. the sequences of forward and reverse primers were 5\u2032-CTGGTAGCAGATGGCTGTGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-ACTGAGGCTGGACA-3\u2032 respectively. RESULTS Rotavirus strains UK and RRV enter different endocytic compartments during cell infection. all siRNAs against the three isoforms of Rab5, the early endosomal antigen (EEA1) and the GTPase Cdc42 decreased BRV UK infectivity. in contrast, in cells transfected with transcriptionally active BRV UK DLPs, the same siRNAs did not have a significant effect on virus replication. however, unlike RRV, BRV UK seems to reach EEs after entering the cell via clathrin-dependent MA104 cells were transfected with the indicated siRNA and then infected with BRV UK at an MOI of 0.02 or lipofected with BRV UK DLPs. at 14 hpi, the cells were fixed and the virus was detected by an immunoperoxidase assay. data are expressed as the percent infectivity of the virus compared to that observed in cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA (Irre) the participation of Cdc42, Rab5 and Rab7 in BRV UK infectivity was confirmed by overexpressing constitutively active (CA) and dominant negative (DN) mutants of these proteins (49) decreased the infectivity of BRV UK by more than 60% percent compared to that of the wild-type or CA Cdc42 V12 protein (Fig. 1C) BRV UK dependence on Rab7/Rab9 is associated with the VP4 capsid protein. reassortants 9, 19, and 20, which contained the VP4 protein from BRV UK origin, decreased significantly in both Rab7a- and Rab9a-silenced cells. reassortants 25 and 85, which had the VP4 protein derived from RRV, behaved like the parental strain RRV. BRV UK genetic background was not available for testing. arithmetic means standard deviations of three independent experiments performed in duplicate are shown. BRV UK infectivity correlates with the presence of the spike protein VP4. VP4 is also associated with the CD-M6PR-dependent infectivity of BRV strain UK. RRV reassortant viruses bearing the VP4 protein of BRV UK were also dependent on the activity of this receptor. the level of the negative strand observed at 0 min was higher than that observed at 60 min. all these data strongly suggest that the dependence of BRV UK on CD-M6PR is associated with the virus spike protein VP4. data are expressed as the percent infectivity of each virus compared to the level of infectivity of cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA. a single amino acid change in VP4 is associated with the late penetration phenotype of rotavirus. a single amino acid change in VP4 is associated with the late penetration phenotype of rotavirus. a single amino acid change in VP4 is associated with the late penetration phenotype. a single-residue change in VP4 associates with the late-penetrating phenotype of RV. the role of GTPases Rab7a and Rab9a and CD-M6PR on the infectivity of Nar3 was evaluated. the infectivity of Nar3 decreased by 50 to 60% when the cells were previously transfected with siRNA to Rab7a or Rab9a. MA104 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the wild-type form of Rab7 and the mutant versions of GTPases Rab5a (Rab5Q79L and Rab5S32N) and Rab7a (Rab7125N) at an MOI of 0.02. at 14 hpi, the cells were fixed and immunostained as described in Materials and Methods. MA104 cells were treated with siRNAs targeting the proteins HRS, TSG101, and VPS24. these siRNA treatments had no effect on the infectivity of lipofected, transcriptionally active DLPs. this suggests that the ESCRT machinery participates in BRV UK infection at the cell entry level. at 24 and 48 hpt, respectively, the cells were infected with BRV UK or Nar3 (MOI = 5), and at 6 hpi, the cells were fixed, prepared for immunofluorescence assay, and analyzed by confocal microscopy. data are expressed as the percent infectivity of BRV UK compared to the level of infectivity of cells incubated with a control isotype antibody. infection with both viruses decreased infectivity of the Nar3 and UK viruses by more than 70%. antibody blocking LBPA inhibited infectivity of BRV UK by more than 60% compared to that of cells exposed to a control IgG. ESCRT formation of ILVs is required to enter cells. RV mutant Nar3 reached endosomal compartments earlier than the BRV UK strain. the colocalization of the UK and Nar3 viruses with the proteins HRS, EEA1, Rab7a, and Rab9a supports the participation of these proteins in virus entry. the infectivity of all RV strains tested was significantly decreased in cells with knocked down expression of Rab5a. of interest, the infectivity of RV strains Wa, WI61, DS-1, and YM was also significantly decreased in cells transfected with siRNAs against Rab7a. the infectivity of the clathrin-independent simian strain SA11-4S (37) remained unaffected. independent experiments performed in duplicate are shown. the asterisks indicate significant differences between the infectivities of each virus in siRNA-transfected cells. cathepsin-specific inhibitors decreased infectivity of BRV UK and ReoT3D to about the same level (40%), while infectivities of RRV, Nar3 and the revertant virus were not affected. the inhibitor of cathepsin L had the same effect on all RV strains as the inhibitor of cathepsin B, but it had a much pronounced effect on the infectivity of ReoT3D. at 14 hpi, cells were fixed and immunostained as described in Materials and Methods. data are expressed as the percent infectivity of each virus compared to their infectivity in cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA. asterisks indicate significant differences between the infectivity of each virus under control and experimental conditions. MA104 cells were either infected with BRV UK-TLPs or lipofected with BRV UK DLPs. the level of gene silencing by the siRNAs used was evaluated by Western blotting or by qRT-PCR. all siRNAs used had a silencing efficiency of 80% or more. all siRNAs against the three isoforms of Rab5, the early endosomal antigen (EEA1) and the GTPase C CD-M6PR is involved in the transport of proteins from the TGN to LEs. infectivity of RRV was not affected by the siRNA against CD-M6PR. that of BRV UK was decreased by this treatment. BRV UK infectivity in cells expressing mutant versions of the indicated GTPases was obtained by normalizing against the infectivity observed in cells transfected with the empty plasmid. the participation of Cdc42, Rab5, and Rab7 in BRV UK infectivity was confirmed by overexpressing constitutively active (CA) and dominant negative (DN) mutants. the expression of the DN mutant of Rab7, Rab7N125I, defective in guanine nucleotide binding (48) decreased by more than 60% the infectivity of BRV UK compared with that of its wild-type counterpart. the inhibition of BRV UK infectivity by Rab9a suggests the transit of CD-M6PR cargo from the TGN to endosomes is needed for cell entry of this RV strain. ssortant 19, whose infectivity was sensitive to Rab7a/Rab9a silencing, is a single-gene reassortant virus that contains the BRV UK VP4 gene in an otherwise RRV genetic background. reassortant 85, which had the BRV UK VP1 and VP7 genes in an otherwise RRV genetic background (including VP4), behaved like the parental strain RRV. black bars, RRV and reassortants bearing RRV VP4; white bars, BRV UK and reassortants bearing BRV UK VP4. the arithmetic means standard deviation of three independent experiments performed in duplicate are shown. the CD-M6PR dependence of BRV UK infectivity correlates with the presence of the spike protein VP4. BRV UK internalization was not reduced under these conditions. the level of the negative strand observed at 0 min was higher than that observed at 60 min. all these data strongly suggest that the dependence of BRV UK on CD-M6PR is associated with the virus spike protein VP4. asterisks indicate significant differences between cells treated with NA and mock-treated cells. a single amino acid change in VP4 is associated with the late penetration phenotype of rotavirus. resistant mutant of RRV is responsible for the neuraminidase resistance phenotype. reversion of arginine 187 to lysine conferred to the revertant Nar3 virus its neuraminidase sensitivity to virus infection (43) this amino acid change was also found to be associated with the endocytic pathway followed by RRV infection of cells. MA104 cells transfected with an siRNA against either Rab7a (siRab7a) or Rab9a (siRab9a) were infected with Nar3 or its revertant viruses at an MOI of 0.02. at 14 hpi, the cells were fixed and immunostained as described in Materials and Methods. ESCRT and the formation of ILVs are important for cell entry of late-penetrating rotaviruses. the involvement of ESCRT and the formation of ILVs in the cell entry of RV strains RRV, Wa, and DS-1 was recently reported. in this work we also evaluated if this complex is required by the L-P RV strains UK and Nar3. at 6 hpi, the cells were fixed and processed for an immunofluorescence assay. data are expressed as the percent infectivity of the virus compared to that observed in cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA. MA104 cells expressing mutant version of ESCRT proteins TSG101 and VPS4A showed a 45% decrease in infection with both viruses. overexpression of the functionally impaired mutant, VPS4A-E228Q (50), decreased the infectivity of the Nar3 and UK viruses by more than 70%. HRS was detected directly in cells that were transfected with a plasmid encoding a fusion of HRS and the cyan fluorescent protein (HRS-CFP) both viruses were found to colocalize with all the cellular molecules assayed. data represent the percent viral colocalization with the indicated cellular markers at the corresponding time points. most rotavirus strains behave as L-P viruses. the vesicular traffic of SA11-4S, Wa, WI61, DS-1, and YM, all of which enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis (37), was evaluated. RNAs against Rab5a (A), Rab7a (B), Rab9a (C), or CD-M6PR (D) were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 0.02. data are expressed as the percent infectivity of each virus compared to the level of infectivity of cells transfected with an irrelevant siRNA, which represents 100% infectivity. we used reovirus type 3 Dearing (ReoT3D) since its infectivity depends on the activity of cathepsins B, L, and S (56, 57) leupeptin inhibited the infectivity of BRV UK by 40%, while it did not affect the infectivities of RRV, Nar3 and the revertant virus. MA104 cells were treated or mock treated with leupeptin (A), the cathepsin B (CTS-B) inhibitor CA-074 (B) or the cathepsin L (CTS-L) inhibitor Z-FF-FMK (C) at 14 or 16 hpi, cells were fixed and immunostained as described in Materials and Methods. data are expressed as the percent infectivity of each virus compared to their infectivity in cells transfected with an irrelevant the infectivity of RV strains UK (bovine), YM (porcine), Wa, WI61, and DS-1 (human) and Nar3, the NA-resistant variant of RRV, depends on the expression of this GTPase. this late endosomal compartment likely provides the optimal environment for the Rab7-dependent strains to enter the cytosol. however, all RV strains that reach LEs also require a functional Rab9a GTPase to in ESCRT machinery components are already present in EEs. all RV strains are delivered to EEs independently of the endocytic route of entry. stability and function of LEs depend on arrival of cellular factors. two types of M6PRs have been described, the 46-kDa cation-dependent CD-M6PR and the 300-kDa cation-independent M6PR (CI-M6PR) both types of M6PRs bind lysosomal enzymes, but they can also selectively transport other cargoes, such as insulin-like growth factor II. the endolysosomal processing by cathepsins is essential for delivery of viral material into the cytosol (61) the GP1 subunit of the virus spike glycoprotein by cathepsins reveals a putative binding domain for the endolysosomal cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick type C1 promotes virus fusion with the limiting membrane of LEs (62). inhibitors of cathepsin L also prevent severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus entry the infectivity of Nar3 was not affected either by knockdown of expression of cathepsins B, L, and S or by treatment with cathepsin inhibitors. the finding that Rab9a is also required affects the retrograde transport of the CD-M6PR and, ultimately, the arrival to LEs of other components. preventing endosomal acidification with NH4Cl and other weak bases does not block the infection of RRV (36, 38, 68, 69), but it reduces the infectivity of RVs UK and Wa (36, 38, 68, 69), as well as the infectivity of those UK RRV reassortants bearing BRV UK VP4. RRV uncoats and likely reaches the cytosolic compartment from MEs. BRV UK has to reach LEs, where the calcium concentration is even lower, before its exit to the cytoplasm. findings suggest that RV uncoating in infected cells is an event more complex than that observed in vitro. vesicular traffic of nonenveloped viruses has been less characterized. mouse polyomavirus, simian virus 40, human papillomavirus, human rhinovirus, canine parvovirus, reovirus, and bluetongue virus have been reported to reach LEs."}
