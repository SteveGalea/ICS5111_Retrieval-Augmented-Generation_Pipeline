{"summary": "CHIKV, a mosquito-borne alphavirus in the family togaviridae, was first isolated in Tanzania in 1952. it recently reemerged in Kenya in 2004 (1, 2, 3). CHIKV has since spread to the Indian Ocean region, South Asia, and Southeast Asia. the region encoding the polyprotein E3-E2-6k-E1 was inserted into an expression vector to produce the pCAGGS-CHIKV E vector. cells were transfected with an empty expression vector or pCAGGS-CHIKV E. CHIKV infection causes fever, rash, myalgia, and arthralgia. lentiviral vector technology has proven to be a safe, efficient, and powerful gene delivery system. lentiviral vectors show tropism based on the expressed glycoprotein. a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with CHIKV should show the same cell tropism. four cell lines used in this study were incubated at 37\u00b0C under a 5% CO2 atmosphere. four female mice were immunized three times at 2-week intervals with formalin-inactivated CHIKV. NIH Thailand confirmed the reactivity of all serum samples by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by a hemagglutination inhibition test. the genome from CHIKV strain 37997 (GenBank accession no. EU224270) was used for plasmid construction. PCR product was inserted into a pCAGGS.MCSII eukaryotic expression vector (24) to construct pCAGGS-CHIKV E. expression was confirmed by transfecting 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies/Gibco) the supernatant containing the pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was harvested, filtered through a 0.45-m syringe filter, and stored in aliquots at 85\u00b0C. the lentiviral vectors were normalized based on the amount of HIV-1 Gag p24 protein present as measured by an HIV-1 p24 antigen capture assay. the lentiviral vectors were titrated by 4-fold serial dilutions starting with 200 ng/ml of p24. one day prior to infection, 3 104 cells were seeded per well in a 24-well plate. after overnight incubation, the cells were incubated for two more days. luciferase activity in cells treated with a mixture of pseudotyped lentiviral vector and control healthy serum diluted at the same ratio. the experiments were independently repeated three times, each with a single sample per dilution. the optical density (OD) was measured with a multiskan FC microplate photometer. infectivity and percent cell viability were calculated relative to untreated cells. the experiments were independently repeated three times, each with a single sample per dilution. equal amounts of CHIKV (100 CCID50/well) and serum solutions were mixed and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. for each sample, two wells were used per dilution. the cells were examined under the microscope to look for cytopathic effects. 100 l of SureBlue Reserve TMB microwell peroxidase substrate 1 (KPL) was added to each well. stop solution (0.6 N H2SO4) was then added (100 l per well) the antibody (Ab) dilution at a cutoff value (OD = 0.100) was calculated using a multiskan FC microplate photometer. a total of 23 human serum samples were collected in Thailand from chikungunya (CHIK)-positive individuals. nine samples were collected in 2009 (NIH Thailand codes: 13-52-20882, 13-52-20883, 13-52-20968, 13-52-21029, 13-52-21080, 13-52-22440, 13-52-23199, 13-52-23346, 13-52-24798) DNA sequences encoding the structural polyprotein E3-E2-6k-E1 were optimized for expression in human-derived cells. the PCR product was inserted into a pCAGGS.MCSII eukaryotic expression vector (24) to construct pCAGGS-CHIKV E. the expression was confirmed by transfecting 293T cells using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent. the supernatant containing the pseudotyped lentiviral vectors was harvested, filtered through a 0.45-m syringe filter. the supernatant was layered onto 7.5% (wt/vol) OptiPrep (iodixanol) medium (Invitrogen) and concentrated by centrifugation at 50,000 g for 1.5 h in an SW 32 Ti rotor (Beckman Coulter, Indianapolis, IN) CHIKV E2 and E1 proteins and the lentiviral vector component, Gag p24, were detected by Western blot analysis using mouse anti-CHIKV (mouse no. 3, prepared by ourselves by immunization) and rabbit anti-p24 (BioAcademia, Ibaraki, Japan) sera. one day before infection, 3 104 cells were seeded per well in a 24-well plate. the lentiviral vectors were diluted to 24 ng/ml of p24 and mixed with a 4-fold serial dilution of serum samples from mice and humans beginning at a dilution of 1:200. the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 1 to 2 h and then added to the cells in each well. the experiments were independently repeated three times, each in triplicate per dilution. cells were treated with ammonium chloride or chloroquine as above. no pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were added to the cells. the optical density was measured with a multiskan FC microplate photometer. serum samples were 2-fold serially diluted with medium (FBS reduced to 2%), starting at a 1:20 dilution to a 1:2,560 dilution (eight dilutions) for mouse sera and human control sera, the starting dilution was set at 1:2. equal amounts of CHIKV (100 CCID50/well) and serum solutions were mixed and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. goat anti-human IgG (H+L; KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) diluted to 1:32,000 with 1% skim milk was added. 100 l of SureBlue Reserve TMB microwell peroxidase substrate 1 (KPL) was added to each well. stop solution (0.6 N H2SO4) was then added. Western blot analysis revealed that the CHIKV proteins E2 and E1 cofractionated with the HIV-1 capsid protein Gag p24. lentiviral vectors were produced by transfection with empty pCAGGS.MCSII vector instead. a negative-control lentiviral vector was produced by transfecting empty pCAGGS.MCSII vector instead. a VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector served as a positive control. the negative-control lentiviral vector produced by transfection with an empty expression vector did not infect cells. pH dependence of cell entry was calculated relative to control cells without chemical treatment. the transduction rates of both the CHIKV- and VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors decreased in a dose-dependent manner when treated with either chemical. cell viability was not significantly affected by either ammonium chloride or chloroquine. CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were normalized to a p24 level of 24 ng/ml. the mixture was added to cells and luciferase activity was measured. the percent inhibition rate by CHIKV-immunized mouse sera was calculated relative to healthy mouse serum. luciferase assay NT titers were compared with those determined by a conventional NT assay. the NT assay using the CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector is likely to be as reliable as the conventional assay. the NT assay using the CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector is likely to be as reliable as the conventional assay. luciferase assay NT titers were compared with antibodies titers. luciferase activity was dose dependent. luciferase activity was dose dependent. the percent inhibition rate was calculated relative to pooled healthy human serum plotted in the normal sample group. CHIK-positive sera, gray circles; control sera, white circles. control sera, gray circles; control sera, white circles. Western blot analysis revealed that the CHIKV proteins E2 and E1 cofractionated with the HIV-1 capsid protein Gag p24. a negative-control lentiviral vector was produced by transfecting empty pCAGGS.MCSII vector instead. a luciferase reporter assay was performed. CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were serially diluted and added to cells. transduction rate was determined by measuring luciferase reporter gene activity (luminescence) negative-control lentiviral vector produced by transfection with an empty expression vector did not infect cells. pH dependence of cell entry was calculated relative to control cells without chemical treatment. -pseudotyped lentiviral vectors decreased in a dose-dependent manner when treated with either chemical. cell viability was not significantly affected by either ammonium chloride or chloroquine. cell entry is pH dependent, as has been demonstrated with native CHIKV. CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vectors were normalized to a p24 level of 24 ng/ml. the mixture was added to cells and luciferase activity was measured. luciferase activity was measured relative to healthy mouse serum. luciferase assay NT titers were compared with those determined by a conventional NT assay. the NT assay using the CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector is likely to be as reliable as the conventional assay. a relatively strong correlation among the four serum samples (y = 0.81x 4.13, r2 = 0.98), suggesting that the ratio of neutralizing antibodies to all CHIKV antibodies was fairly constant among lentiviral vector was incubated with the highest dilution of CHIK-positive serum (1:51,200) luciferase activity was dose dependent. luciferase assay NT titers were compared with antibody titers. CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector system allows for the investigation of CHIKV-host interactions without the danger of exposure to the highly pathogenic native CHIKV. CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector system allows for the investigation of CHIKV-host interactions. the CHIKV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector transduced three cell lines that are permissive for CHIKV infection. the transduction was less efficient than that with a VSV-pseudotyped lentiviral vector. some viruses, such as CHIKV and VSV, infect cells in a pH-dependent manner. assay NT titers obtained with serum samples from infected human patients correlated well with those obtained by conventional NT assay or CHIKV antibody ELISA. this high degree of correlation supports the reliability of the NT assay system that was developed for this study. chronic arthralgia is a hallmark of CHIKV infection and causes significant burden to patients. current endemic CHIKV strains can also cause severe symptoms, such as neurological complications or even death."}
