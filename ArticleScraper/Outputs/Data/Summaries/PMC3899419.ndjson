{"summary": "the first known outbreak of 2009 H1N1 in a train occurred in china in 2009. a retrospective epidemiologic investigation was conducted to collect information from passengers, crew members, contacts, and health care providers. all cases were confirmed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction testing. 9teen confirmed 2009 H1N1 cases were identified. global distribution of the pandemic prompted the world health organization to declare the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century in June 2009. the first confirmed case of 2009 H1N1 infection was identified on 11 May 2009 in mainland China. a suspected case of 2009 H1N1 was defined as a person with ARI and 1 of the following symptoms: rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, or cough. a confirmed case was defined as a patient with ARI. a confirmed case was defined as a patient with ARI. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol and tested by rRT-PCR following the US CDC protocol. assays were performed in provincial centers for disease control and prevention and confirmed by the national Influenza Center of the China CDC. routine surveillance and reporting of suspected cases are done through the National Notifiable Disease Reporting System. the announcements requested passengers and staff to present themselves to local public health authorities for evaluation. respondents who had a history of ARI or who had been in the train car with a confirmed case-patient were investigated. the infectious period for a confirmed case-patient was defined as the time period from 1 day before illness to either 7 days after illness onset or resolution of symptoms, whichever was longer. a chi-square (2) test was used for testing statistical significance. a P value less than 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. all service personnel worked 8-hour shifts alternating with 8-hour breaks. the windows remained closed in first class (car 11) and the crew car (car 18) because those cars were air-conditioned. the windows could be opened in other cars (2\u20139, 10, 12, and 14\u201317) crew 12 Liupanshui 5 Female/21 6-10-09 11:30 AM Passenger 12 Guangzhou 6 Male/49 6-10-09 11:30 AM Passenger 12 Guangzhou 7 Female/23 6-10-09 4:00 PM Crew 11 Chengdu 8 Female/27 6-10-09 9:00 PM Crew Supervisor Chengdu 9 Female/23 6-11-09 12:00 PM Passenger 14 Liuzhou 11 Male/40 6-12-09 12:00 PM Passenger 11 Dujun 12 Male/22 6-12-09 the median incubation period was estimated at 3 days (range: 0\u20133) of the 19 cases identified, the estimated median interval was 2 days from the first to the second generation. of the 19 cases identified, the median interval was 2 days from the first to the second generation (range: 1\u20134), the second to the third generation (range: 1\u20133), and the third to the fourth generation (range: 2\u20133). the average temperature was approximately 23\u00b0C at night and 30\u00b0C during the day in the 4 provinces through which the train passed. the attack rate in car 12, where the index case travelled, was higher (7.14%) than in car 11, which was air-conditioned (5.13%). 3 (0.87%) developed 2009 ARI (third generation) among the 13 confirmed first- and second-generation case-patients, another 3 developed ARI (fourth generation) 3 asymptomatic cases were also identified during medical observation. service personnel worked 8-hour shifts and walked through their car at least once every 30 minutes. the windows remained closed in first class (car 11) and the crew car (car 18) because those cars were air-conditioned. a total of 19 confirmed cases were identified through surveillance. anshui 5 Female/21 6-10-09 11:30 AM Passenger 12 Guangzhou 6 Male/49 6-10-09 11:30 AM Passenger 12 Guangzhou 7 Female/23 6-10-09 4:00 PM Crew 11 Chengdu 8 Female/27 6-10-09 9:00 PM Crew Supervisor Chengdu 9 Female/25 6-12-09 12:00 PM Passenger 14 Liuzhou 11 Male/18 6-13-09 12:00 PM Passenger 11 Dujun 15 Female/38 6-14-09 12:00 PM Passen the median incubation period was estimated at 3 days (range: 0\u20133) of the 19 cases identified, the estimated median interval was 2 days from the first to the second generation (range: 1\u20134) of the 19 cases identified, the median interval was 2 days from the first to the second generation (range: 1\u20133) and the third to the fourth generation (range: 2\u20133). the average temperature was approximately 23\u00b0C at night and 30\u00b0C during the day in the 4 provinces through which the train passed. the attack rate in car 12, where the index case travelled, was higher (7.14%) than in car 11, which was air-conditioned (5.13%). the index case-patient in car 12 was infected while on board and transmitted the virus to the crew, who then spread it to other passengers and crew members. the long distance and duration of the trip (41 hours) as well as close contact in the train may have increased the probability of communicable disease transmission. asymptomatic cases were also identified during medical observation. the longer the time spent on the train, the higher the risk of infection. the longer the time spent on the train, the higher the risk of infection. the longer the time spent on the train, the higher the risk of infection. there was only 1 case of 2009 H1N1 infection on a transportation vehicle. this might constitute overreaction to the event in relatively mild pandemics. establishing and maintaining a surveillance system for ARI among train passengers might help in determining baseline levels of illness. longer quarantine would burden the health system and would not be cost-effective. we identified 22 cases of 2009 H1N1 infection associated with train 1223. close contact and longer time on board may have contributed to the transmission of pandemic influenza H1N1 virus in the train."}
