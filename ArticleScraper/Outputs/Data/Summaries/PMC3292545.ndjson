{"summary": "a continuous threat is posed by newly emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. the global effort to meet this challenge has resulted in an enhanced ability to identify and genetically fingerprint the causative agent, often with extraordinary speed. the speed at which we acquire genetic information on the causative agents of newly emerging infectious diseases is not matched by the speed at which we can develop suitable treatments. Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) viruses are two closely related, recently emerged, causative agents of zoonosis. both viruses have re-emerged several times with recent outbreaks showing well documented person-to-person transmission. there are no vaccines available for either virus, although both protein [13], [14] and DNA [15] vaccination approaches appear to be potentially effective. vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infected the transfected cells with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) lacking the gene for the entry glycoprotein G, but pseudotyped with VSV G. we subsequently assessed antiviral agents for their ability to inhibit viral spread. this method has several advantages. the pseudotyped virus is prepared with a VSV background, using VSV delta G pseudotyped with VSV G. this enables virus entry mediated by VSV G, but does not result in subsequent rounds of infection by VSV. a Z\u2032 value 1.0 is considered to be perfect, and assays with a value above 0.5 are required. the Z\u2032 value for the multicycle replication as compared to the uninfected control was 0.83. 293 T cells transfected with NiV F/G concomitantly with Venus-YFP were infected with pseudotyped NiV. infection was measured 48 hrs post infection by reading intensity of RFP expression. anti-HeV G antibodies gave a better dose response than anti-HeV F antibodies. five rats were immunized with pCAGGS-NiV G. serum from five rats was collected and tested for inhibition of infection. monoclonal antibodies from three rats had much stronger neutralizing properties. immunization with high concentrations of Ebola GP did not induce neutralizing antibodies [25], [27]. to validate our strategy for live Nipah and Hendra viruses we performed a in vitro neutralization assay. the neutralizing capacity of the polyclonal rabbit and monoclonal rat antibodies that we generated was compared to that of the murine mAb anti-NiV F. validation of modified pseudotyped virus assay. compared results of two rat polyclonal antibodies raised against NiV. but effectiveness in modified assay was lower compared to inhibition obtained when pseudotyped NiV was used for infection. pseudotyped NiV (A) or pseudotyped VSV (B) in presence of rat anti-NiV antibodies, Rat 2 (circles) or Rat 5 (squares) were measured after 48 hrs. the modified assay is adaptable to other enveloped viruses. a new tab Cells were transfected with plasmids encoding glycoproteins from Lujo (A), Junin (B), VSV (C) or the influenza glycoprotein HA (D) then infected with pseudotyped VSV (triangles) transfected cells were also left uninfected as a control (squares) the pseudotyped virus is prepared with a VSV background, using VSV delta G pseudotyped with VSV G. this enables virus entry mediated by VSV G, but does not result in subsequent rounds of infection by VSV. the Z\u2032 value for multicycle replication as compared to the uninfected control was 0.83 (table 1). cDNA immunization of rabbits to generate polyclonal antibodies. polyclonal antibodies from all 4 rabbits inhibited infection in our original pseudotyped viral entry assay format. infection was measured 48 hrs post infection by reading intensity of RFP expression. anti-HeV G antibodies, especially from rabbit D, gave a better dose response than anti-HeV F antibodies. infection was measured 48 hrs after infection. polyclonal antibodies from three rats had relatively low neutralizing activity. monoclonal antibodies were also generated by immunizing rats with pCAGGS-NiV G. antibody-mediated neutralization of live Nipah and Hendra viruses compared to that of the murine mAb anti-NiV F, Gip21, previously reported to neutralize both NiV and HeV. both rabbit polyclonal anti-HeV F antibodies neutralized HeV, and one neutralized HeV as well. lative neutralization titer is presented as a reciprocal dilution of antibody samples that completely inhibited either NiV or HeV cytopathic effect. compared the results of two rat polyclonal antibodies raised against NiV G using the assay described above and our modified MCR assay. but the effectiveness in the modified assay was lower compared to the inhibition obtained when pseudotyped NiV was used for infection. 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding the surface glycoproteins of Lujo virus (Fig. 6A), Junin virus (Fig. 6B) or VSV (Fig. 6C) concomitantly with YFP (yellow fluorescent protein) to allow visualization of the transfection. cells transfected with the control plasmid were also infected with the pseudotyped virus (single cycle) transfected cells were left uninfected as a control (squares) and cells transfected with control empty plasmid were also infected with pseudotyped VSV (triangles) henipavirus multicycle replication effectively blocked the VSV assay as expected. cDNA immunization of rats using cDNA corresponding to the surface glycoproteins of viruses effectively generates monoclonal antibodies whose activity and specificity can be tested using a platform adaptable to a broad range of viruses. cDNA immunization of rats is particularly suited for the generation of antibodies against membrane proteins. eliciting anti-F antibodies, at least for the cDNA immunization, may lead to more broadly neutralizing antibodies [18]. the use of passive immunotherapy has the advantage of generating immunity immediately in the patient. evaluating the neutralizing activity of potential therapeutic antibodies requires infection of cells with the virus of interest. a human monoclonal antibody against Nipah G has shown partial protection in the ferret animal model [16]. the strategy described in this manuscript would allow for the direct identification of neutralizing human monoclonal antibodies without intermediate steps. we propose that the system could be designed as a kit that includes the genetic material for the VSV-G-RFP [36], ultimately requiring only the specific viral cDNA to be mixed together. 293 T cells were transfected with plasmid encoding VSV-G or NiVF/G. 293 T cells were transfected with plasmid encoding VSV-G or NiVF/G. supernatant fluid containing pseudotyped virus was collected 18 h post-infection. VSV-G glycoproteins were pseudotyped onto VSV-G\u2013RFP. the resulting pseudotyped viruses were used to infect viral glycoprotein(s)-expressing cells. the wells were read by excitation at 535-nm and emission at 579-nm. antibodies were incubated with virus for 60 min at 37\u00b0C in DMEM. 96-well plates were incubated for 4 days at 37\u00b0C. a total of 2.5104 Vero cells were then added to each well. seudotyped viruses were generated using VSV-G-RFP. 293 T cells were transfected with plasmid encoding VSV-G or NiVF/G. supernatant fluid containing pseudotyped virus was collected 18 h post-infection. the wells were read by excitation at 535-nm and emission at 579-nm. for the detection of YFP expression, the wells were read by excitation at 510-nm and emission at 535-nm. for the modified multicycle replication assay, VSV-G glycoprotein was pseudotyped onto VSV-G\u2013RFP. anti-NiV G antibodies 293 T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding NiV G/F and YFP. the cells were infected with VSV-G pseudotyped virus or with NiV F/G pseudotyped virus."}
