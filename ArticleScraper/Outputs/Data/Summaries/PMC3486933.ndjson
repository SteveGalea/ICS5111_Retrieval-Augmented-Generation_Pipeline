{"summary": "three hundred and twenty clinical specimens were tested with the AdvanSure RV real-time PCR kit and conventional multiplex reverse transcription (RT)-PCR assay. the one-step AdvanSure RV real-time PCR kit was compared with the conventional multiplex RT-PCR assay. the limit of detection was 1.31 plaque-forming units (PFU)/mL for human rhinoviruses (hRVs), 4.93 PFU/mL for human coronavirus HC infectious respiratory diseases in humans may be caused by several pathogens, including viruses and bacteria that produce very similar clinical symptoms. an effective diagnostic assay for these pathogens in individual samples is urgently needed [5] clinical virology laboratories have used methods such as direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) and virus culture. the one-step AdvanSure multiplex real-time PCR assay can simultaneously detect up to 14 different RVs. specific target pathogens for this assay are 12 types of RNA viruses, i.e.,- several human coronaviruses. swabs (NS) and 5 throat swabs (TS) were stored at -70\u00b0C before nucleic acid extraction and multiplex PCR assays. all 320 specimens were analyzed by using the one-step multiplex real-time Advan Sure RV real-time PCR kit. OC43 (KBPV-VR-8), PIV-1 (KBPV-VR-44), PIV-2 (KBPV-VR-45), FluB (KBPV-VR-34), hRSV-A (KBPV-VR-41), and hRVs (KBPV-VR-39) were purchased from the Korea Bank for Pathogenic Viruses. sensitivity of the AdvanSure RV real-time PCR assay was determined for each of the human T-lymphotropic virus (HTLV)-I and/or II-positive human plasma (DR1191), cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG-positive human plasma (DV1030), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgG-positive human plasma (DV1053), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) I and/or II-IgG positive human plasma (DV1081), Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-positive the RNA or DNA of supplied samples was extracted and assayed with the AdvanSure RV real-time PCR kit adhering to the same procedures used for sample processing. all 320 specimens which were used in the one-step multiplex real-time PCR and conventional multiplex RT-PCR assay were tested using the Seeplex RV12 Detection Kit (Seegene) simultaneously. PCR reactions were cycled in the following sequence 40 times. the final cycle was followed by an extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. the amplified PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel. the nested PCR was performed using 10 L of HS Taq premix (Genetbio, Nonsan, Korea), 5 L of inner primer and probe set. 30 cycles of 3-step PCR were performed (15 sec at 95\u00b0C, 30 sec at 53\u00b0C, and 30 sec at 60\u00b0C) the fluorescent signals were detected as part of real-time signal monitoring. 5 L of extracted nucleic acids were added in an AdvanSure RV real-time PCR reaction tube containing 5 L of primer probe mixture and 10 L of one-step RT-PCR premix. the mixture was incubated at 50\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 10 cycles of PCR. the sensitivity of the AdvanSure RV real-time PCR assay was determined for each of the viruses using 5-fold serial dilutions of virus suspensions in Microtest M4RT multi-microbe media. the sensitivity was quantified in terms of plaque-forming units (PFUs) per milliliter (PFU/mL) the sensitivity was quantified in terms of plaque-forming units (PFUs) per milliliter. cytomegalovirus (CMV) IgG-positive human plasma (DV1030), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) IgG-positive human plasma (DV1053), Herpes simplex virus (HSV) I and/or II-IgG positive human plasma (DV1081), Varicella zoster virus (VZV)-positive human plasma (DR1093) were supplied by Trina Bioreactives AG (Pembroke Pines, FL samples were extracted and assayed with the AdvanSure RV real-time PCR kit adhering to the same procedures used for sample processing. all 320 specimens which were used in the one-step multiplex real-time PCR and conventional multiplex RT-PCR assay were tested by conventional multiplex RT-PCR assays. multiplex RT-PCR targeted genes for 11 types of RVs were as follows: HCoV-229E/NL63, HCoV-OC43, PIV-1, PIV-2, PIV-3, FluA, FluB, hRSV-A, hRSV-B, hRVs and ADVs. gene sequencing was performed by Geno-Tech (Daejeon, Korea) the PCR products, purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen) were used as template DNA for bidirectional sequencing. the PCR for sequencing was performed using BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing and analyzed with an ABI 3100 Prism Automated DNA sequencer. the assay sensitivity was also compared with that of several previously reported US FDA-approved commercial RV test kits. FluB and hRSV-B exhibited higher LOD values in our assay, compared to other compared commercial RV test kits. 4 samples that were identified as positive by the AdvanSure assay were identified as negative samples by the conventional RT-PCR assays. 2 clinical samples that were negative in the AdvanSure multiplex real-time PCR assay were identified as positive by the conventional RT-PCR assay. detection of hRVs was the most sensitive among the 11 targeted standard viruses. the LODs of fluB, PIV-1, PIV-2, and hRSV-B showed decreased sensitivity compared to the LODs of the other viruses. sensitivity was also compared with that of several previously reported US FDA-approved commercial RV test kits. results were negative and no non-specific positive reaction was observed. comparison of the one-step AdvanSure RV multiplex real-time PCR assay and conventional multiplex RT-PCR assay were performed on 320 clinical samples simultaneously. a variety of clinical diagnostic assays have been reported, but cell culture is still considered the \"gold standard\" cell culture is still considered the \"gold standard\" however, this method has drawn criticism for difficulties such as maintaining cell cultures, instability of cultured cells and a long turnaround cycle. the one-step AdvanSure assay provides a faster turnaround time. it minimizes the possibility of contamination as it eliminates the need for additional post-PCR processing of the samples. sensitivity of the AdvanSure assay demonstrated its clinical potential. the sensitivity of the conventional multiplex RT-PCR was 44.06% (141/320), while the sensitivity of the AdvanSure assay was 44.68% (143/320). the main advantage of the assay is the ability to identify 2 additional RVs not detected by the conventional RT-PCR assay, including hMPVs and HBoV. direct antigen tests or virus cultures cannot be completely replaced by multiplex PCR assays. the conventional multiplex RT-PCR kit used in this study featured a dual priming oligonucleotide system, but still yielded higher false-positive results."}
