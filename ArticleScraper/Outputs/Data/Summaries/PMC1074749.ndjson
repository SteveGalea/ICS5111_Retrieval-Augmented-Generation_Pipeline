{"summary": "the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was controlled after the identification of the causative agent coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (1). standard genomic walking techniques are used to extend the known sequence. sequences of some viruses, such as SARS-CoV, have altered during transmission, and this may prevent the detection of the virus by a PCR method. cDNA RDA can be applied to total RNA without interference with ribosomal RNAs. the selection of poly(A)+ RNA by using an oligo(dT) column followed by oligo(dT) priming can eliminate the influence of ribosomal RNAs on cDNA synthesis. a total of 96 hexamer patterns were synthesized and mixed for use as an RT primer. a total of 96 hexamer patterns were synthesized and mixed for use as an RT primer. hexanucleotide patterns of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides are aligned according to the probabilities in ribosomal RNAs. the 10 highest and lowest frequent patterns are listed in the table. a MySQL table included sequence data of viral genomes. the table included EMBL ID, title, annotation and sequence as fields. the annotation field included taxonomic classification of the origin of the data. sequences of mammalian viruses were divided into groups according to their species presented in the taxonomic table. the resultant 1791 viral sequences were inserted into a table titled \u2018Genomic sequence of viral species\u2019. the viral infection was established in the cells with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 10. the work with SARS-CoV was performed in accordance with the rules for infectious pathogens that have been notified by the National Institute of Infectious Disease. cDNA RDA First-strand cDNA was synthesized from the mixed RNA with non-ribosomal hexanucleotides. the total RNA was diluted to 1 g per l and mixed with dNTPs, the non-ribosomal hexanucleotides, 5 reaction buffer, 0.1 M DTT and an RNase inhibitor. l of the ligation solution was diluted with Taq mixture (10 l of 10 Taq buffer, including 15 mM MgCl2 and 0.2 mM each of dNTPs) the mixture was preheated to 72\u00b0C, and then, Taq polymerase (Promega) was added. after amplification, amplicons were redigested with Dpn II and purified with a silicon-membrane-based purification kit. uninfected cells without a linker were amplified by a denaturation step (94\u00b0C for 2 min) and 20 cycles of PCR (94\u00b0C for 1 min and 72\u00b0C for 3 min) RNAs extracted from virus-infected cells were subjected to cDNA RDA as described above, by using amplicons synthesized from RNA obtained from uninfected cells. cDNA RDA-derived fragments were purified, labelled with DIG and independently hybridized using a slit of the nylon membrane blotted with amplicons derived from SARS-CoV-infected cells. cloning and sequence analysis The cDNA RDA-derived fragments were respliced with Dpn II, separated on agarose gels. hexanucleotide frequency analysis of ribosomal RNAs was selected. genome sequences of AY291315) and bovine parainfluenza virus 3 (BPI3, NC_002161) were also selected as representatives of RNA virus (11). we created three programs, GREG, GAS and OSC. hexanucleotide patterns of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides are aligned according to the probabilities in ribosomal RNAs. the 10 highest and lowest frequent patterns are listed in the table. if Motif Motif Motif Motif Motif Motif GATATC GATACT

included taxonomic classification of the origin of the data. we then selected EMBL IDs of mammalian viruses with any of the viral family names listed in Table 5. sequences of mammalian viruses were divided into groups according to their species presented in the taxonomic table. fetal bovine serum (v/v) maintained at 37\u00b0C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2. the cells were split once in 25 cm2 flasks and cultured until they reached 100% confluence. the virus infection was established in the cells with a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i) of 10. the entire molecule of pCIneo plasmid was transcribed in vitro from a promoter. the synthesized 5.4 kb RNA was treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega), extracted with phenol/chloroform, precipitated with ethanol. the test and control RNAs were mixed to estimate the sensitivity of cDNA RDA in various conditions. digested cDNA was ligated with RBam24 and RBam12 linkers. aliquot of 1 l was diluted with Taq mixture (10 l of 10 Taq buffer, including 15 mM MgCl2, and 0.2 mM each of dNTPs) the mixture was preheated to 72\u00b0C, and then, Taq polymerase (Promega) was added. after amplification, amplicons were redigested with D amplicons from normal cellular RNA with a linker included in the test amplicons were hybridized with those from uninfected cells without a linker. after hybridization, the reaction mixture was diluted to 100 l with reaction buffer of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega) as described above. amplicons having the linker sequence at both ends were amplified by a denaturation step (94\u00b0C for 2 min) and 20 cycles of PCR (94\u00b0C amplicons derived from SARS-CoV-infected cells were identical to SARS-CoV. PCR products were purified, labelled with DIG and independently hybridized using a slit of the nylon membrane. ribosomal and satellite sequences were determined for hexanucleotide frequency analysis. we synthesized cDNA from RNA extracted from normal bovine cells, synthesized amplicons by using random primers, spliced them with Dpn II and finally subcloned them into pSPORT1. ribosomal and satellite sequences were selected as representatives of RNA viral sequence. 8 hexanucleotides did not exist and over 90 hexanucleotides were rare in the ribosomal sequence. the probabilities of hexamer patterns in ribosomal RNA and satellite repeat were calculated. the hexamer patterns were then realigned in ascending order according to the sum of probabilities. hexanucleotide patterns were aligned according to their probability in the ribosomal RNAs. the rarity of non-ribosomal hexanucleotides was confirmed in reported sequences of mammalian ribosomal RNAs. pre rRNA gene M.musculus 22 118 281 6.35 897 20.28 974.8 22.04 M11188 18S rRNA gene.
