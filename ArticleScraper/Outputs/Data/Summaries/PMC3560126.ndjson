{"summary": "liquiritin, isoliquiritin, liquiritinapioside, glabridin, glycyrrhetic acid and glycyrrhizic acid (GA) is a major triterpene saponin found from the roots of Glycyrrhizaglabra. it has wide spectrum of medicinal applications which includes hepato-protective, anti-inflammatory, antidotal, anti-allergic, immuno the eluent is monitored at 254 nm following an isocratic elution. a c18 column is used with a mobile phase consisting of either methanol or acetonitrile as organic component along with an aqueous phase containing either an acid modifier like acetic acid or phosphoric acid. system control and data acquisition was carried out using Empower 2 software (Waters, USA) the separation was carried out in reverse phase Kromasil C18 column (125 mm 4.0 mm, 5 ; Akzonobel, USA) the mobile phase was a mixture of 65%, 5.3 mM phosphate buffer (pH = 3.0) and 35% acetonitrile which was filtered through 0.45 m millipore filter paper. the ESI was operated at Ion spray voltage 5500 V. the source temperature was 200\u00b0C. the cone voltage was 50 V, focusing potential 200 V and entrance potential 10 V. the robustness of the method was determined by making slight changes in chromatographic conditions like composition (5%) and pH (0.1%) of mobile phase. the results were represented as mean S.D. values for three to six replicate injections. rile was filtered through 0.45 m Millipore filter paper. the flow rate was 1.0 ml/minute and the column was maintained at ambient temperature. for identity confirmation the analysis was carried out on a LC-MS/MS. each dilution of the stock was injected in triplicates. the least square method was used. the sample solution was prepared by diluting the sample cough syrup to a dilution range 100 g/ml. the LC-DAD analysis revealed the peak to be pure and spectrally homogenous with peak purity angle 0.357. this was less than the peak purity threshold 0.438. a reasonable resolution between the GA peak and the closely eluting peaks was observed in the sample. specificity A HPLC method was considered to be specific if it ensures that the measured peak was only due to the substance being analyzed. in all cases the purity angle was less than the peak purity threshold indicating the absence of any co-eluting peaks. repeatability was measured on the basis of six replicate injections of the 124 g/ml GA solution on the same day. the intermediate precision was obtained by triplicate injection of the sample solution on three different days. the intra-day and inter-day precision values were calculated from the linearity curve and the observed % RSD value was found to be 2.0. maxima in case of LC-DAD analysis was observed at 252 nm. peak purity angle 0.357 was less than peak purity threshold 0.438. a reasonable resolution between the GA peak and the closely eluting peaks was observed in the sample. if the measured peak was due to the substance being analyzed, it was free from potential impurities or co-eluting components. the purity angle was less than the peak purity threshold indicating the absence of any co-eluting peaks. the sample solution was spiked at three levels and the recovery was 99.99%, 99.84% and 99.97% respectively. the average recovery was 99.93 0.26% respectively."}
