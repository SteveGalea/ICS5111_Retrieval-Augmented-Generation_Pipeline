{"summary": "CHIKV is a medically important human alphavirus known to cause distinctive polyarthritis or polyarthralgia. common clinical features include fever, maculopapular rash, myalgia,2. severe complications such as encephalitis and mortality may occur in immunocompromised individuals. virion surface architecture, E1 and E2 participate complementarily in CHIKV entry. as a type-I fusion protein, E2 first mediates CHIKV attachment to the cellular receptor by interaction with surface-exposed regions on domain A and B. currently, there are no licensed vaccine or effective antiviral for CHIKV disease. a panel of CHIKV-specific mouse IgMs was generated and characterized for their neutralizing efficacy and antigenicity in vitro. two purified mAbs, 3E7b and 8A2c, neutralize CHIKV infection potently with IC50 of 4\u20135 ng/ml. b escape mutants identified 3 distinct mutations that are solvent-accessible and sequence-conserved on CHIKV E2 protein. however, further studies through reverse genetics identified only E2-N218 as critical for 3E7b binding and neutralization. findings can be projected for a rationale epitope vaccine design. 4 clones, 3E7b, 8A2c, 8D3d and 10C5b, were shown to neutralize CHIKV infection. at least 90% of cells were stained negatively for CHIKV antigen. 3E7b and 8A2c clones were purified and identified as IgM mAbs. the results indicate 3E7b and 8A2c IgMs are highly specific to CHIKV antigen, particularly to the native E1 or E2 protein exposed on the surface of CHIKV. the results indicate 3E7b and 8A2c IgMs are highly specific to CHIKV antigen. mice ascites or purified IgMs were serially-diluted in sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) before each dilution was incubated with 100 plaque-forming units (PFU) of CHIKV. the mixture was then added to confluent BHK-21 cells. a post-PRNT was performed to determine if the neutralization efficacy is maintained when 3E7b was added after CHIKV has bounded to the cell surface. this suggests that 3E7b-mediated neutralization of CHIKV requires a pre-incubation of the mAb with CHIKV. this leads to ineffective CHIKV attachment when the mixture is added to BHK cells. the standard PRNT was performed by incubating 3E7b with 100 PFU of CHIKV Ross strain. SINV is a representative member of the Sindbis serocomplex. RRV shares the same Semliki Forest Virus serocomplex with CHIKV. this suggests that 3E7b is specific in CHIKV neutralization. CHIKV/PBS 1a and CHIKV/IgM 1a clones were susceptible to 3E7b neutralization with IC50 of 0.12 g/ml and 0.17 g/ml. however, CHIKV/3E7b 1a clone was not neutralized by 3E7b at 2.5 g/ml, the highest concentration used earlier for the generation of escape mutation. 7b clones showed 3 single point mutation in E2 gene that results in ED at residue 24 (E24D), ND at residue 218 (N218D) and DG at residue 223 (D223G) in the E2 protein. none of the escape clones, represented by CHIKV/3E7b 3a and 7a clones, as well as CHIKV/IgM 4a and CHIKV/PBS 1a control clones CHIKV/3E7b 1a clone shows 3 single base A substitution in CHIKV E2 gene. ED, ND and DG amino acid mutation at position 24, 218 and 233 of E2 protein, respectively. no mutation was identified in CHIKV/PBS 1a, CHIKV/IgM 1a and 4a clones. mapped the 3 identified escape mutations onto this model. E24 is found to be located on the N-terminal hairpin of domain A. N218 and D223 are both located on the outermost tip of domain B. both are spatially closer to each other, with a proximity of 13.0. all CHIKV mutant clones showed similar growth kinetic profile to CHIKV-IVT and CHIKV-WT virus controls. cDNA clone-generated CHIKV displayed higher replication efficacy relative to CHIKV-WT control. CHIKV-E24D and CHIKV-D223G retained strong binding efficacy to 3E7b similar to CHIKV-WT and CHIKV-IVT controls. only 2.1% of the cells infected with CHIKV-N218D were positively stained with 3E7b relative to 95.3% and 99.5% binding. signal of 3E7b binding is expressed as a percentage over 594 signal that represents the number of infected cells, n, quantitated. one-way ANOVA followed by a post-Dunnett test, with statistical significance defined as ***p 0.001. IC50 values of 3E7b from neutralization of CHIKV-IVT, CHIKV-E24D and CHIKV-D223G are at least 2.6-fold higher. overall neutralization trend was similar among CHIKV-WT, CHIKV-IVT and mutant clones except for CHIKV-N218D. sequences flanking the mutation were aligned with all existing CHIKV structural polyprotein and E2 sequence neonate mouse model showed clinical features similar to those reported in CHIKV-infected patients. neonate mice developed high viremia and viral loads in various tissues including the hind limb muscles, liver, spleen and brain. mice showed poor survival (40%) at day 14 p.i.. but mice pre-treated with 3E7b were able to overcome CHIKV-induced lethality. dose-dependent protection is highly significant by log-rank test. infected mice were subjected to the same treatment and infection regimen as described. mice were harvested at day 2 p.i and quantitated by CHIKV titer. mice that were mock-infected or pre-treated with 3E7b were sacrificed on day 7 p.i. and harvested for their limbs. limb muscles were paraformaldehyde-fixed, decalcified and processed according to the standard procedures for hematoxylin & eosin staining. neonate mice were CHIKV-infected as described and post-treated with 20 g of 3E7b at 4 h p.i. at day 2 p.i., serum and various tissues were harvested and quantitated for CHIKV titer. histological analysis of mice limb muscles at day 7 p.i. revealed partial protection. some areas retained healthy morphology while others were necrotized with infiltration of inflammatory cells. this suggests the protective effect of 3E7b against CHIKV infection could have helped to overcome CHIKV-induced lethality. a 35-38 kD band, suggestive of CHIKV capsid protein was strongly detected by all mice sera 1 to 4. a weak band of 52\u201355 kD likely to be E1 or E2 protein was recognized by mice sera 1 to 4. the spleen of mouse 1 was harvested for the production of anti-CHIKV mAbs. purified CHIKV was coated onto ELISA plate and a range of mAbs was added. 3E7b and 8A2c binding to CHIKV is close to saturation at higher than 25 ng of IgM. results suggest 3E7b and 8A2c IgMs are highly specific to CHIKV antigen. CHIKV were coated onto 96-well plate and incubated with anti-CHIKV IgMs, IgM isotype antibody or mouse anti-CHIKV E2 8A4 IgG mAb positive control at a range of 0.1 to 100 ng. negative control consists of wells not coated with CHIKV. purified mice ascites and purified IgM were 2-fold serially diluted in PBS before incubating with 100 PFU of CHIKV. both 3E7b and 8A2c are strongly neutralizing against 100 PFU of CHIKV across the wide range of mAb concentration tested. 3E7b failed to block CHIKV replication after virus-host cell attachment occurred. this suggests 3E7b-mediated neutralization of CHIKV requires a pre-incubation of the mAb with CHIKV. this leads to ineffective CHIKV attachment when the mixture is added to BHK cells. non-linear regression analysis of 3E7b against CHIKV Ross strain is performed and best-fitted to dose-dependent inhibition curve. however due to wide variability, the derived IC50 is not applicable. Error bars are representative of SEM where at least 3 independent sets in duplicates were performed. both CHIKV/PBS 1a and CHIKV/IgM 1a clones were susceptible to 3E7b neutralization with IC50 of 0.12 g/ml and 0.17 g/ml. however, CHIKV/3E7b 1a clone was not neutralized by 3E7b at 2.5 g/ml, the highest concentration used earlier for the generation of escape mutation. all 7 representative CHIKV/3E7b PRNT was performed to investigate the escape ability of CHIKV/3E7b clone to mAb 3E7b. 2.5 g/ml of 3E7b, 5 g/ml of IgM isotype control or PBS was evaluated against a representative clone CHIKV/3E7b 1a diluted to 1000 PFU. E24, N218 and D223, are presented as stick structures that show carbon and hydrogen atoms (white), oxygen atom (red) and nitrogen (blue). Various studies have demonstrated that an escape mutation on viral envelope protein represents a critical mAb epitope for virus neutralization. reverse genetics technique was employed to generate full-length infectious CHIKV clones that contained a single mutation of E24D, N218D or D223G. CHIKV-IVT (CHIKV generated from in vitro transcribed-infectious clone cDNA template) and CHIKV-WT (wildtype CH122508 strain), they were evaluated for their replication competency in BHK cells. CHIKV E2 binding to 3E7b was tested by co-staining of viral-infected cells with 3E7b IgM and anti-CHIKV E2 IgG positive control. CHIKV-E24D and CHIKV-D223G retained strong binding efficacy to 3E7b similar to CHIKV-WT and CHIKV-IVT controls. cells were infected with CHIKV-WT, CHIKV-IVT, CHIKV-E24D, CHIKV-N218D or CHIKV-D223G clones at MOI 10. the difference in binding was visualized with goat anti-mouse IgM FITC and anti-rabbit IgG 594 secondary antibodies. FITC signal of 3E7b binding is expressed as a percentage over 594 signal CHIKV-N218D mutants were neutralized effectively over the tested range of 3E7b concentration from 3.81 pg/ml to 0.25 g/ml. the overall neutralization trend was similar among CHIKV-WT, CHIKV-E24D and mutant clones except for CHIKV-N218D. these escape mutations were found to be 100% identical with >178 published sequences. 3E7b was tested in a neonate mouse model of CHIKV infection. this model showed clinical features similar to those reported in CHIKV-infected mice. this suggests that neonate mouse is an ideal in vivo model for recapitulating CHIKV pathogenesis. the prophylactic efficacy of 3E7b was assessed over a mAb dose range of 0.2, 2, 20 or 200 g per mouse that was given intraperitoneally at 24 h and 8 h prior to infection with 4 105 PFU of CH6708 strain. all control mice that received PBS succumbed to lethal CHIKV infection by day 9 p.i. five-day oldBALB/c mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with PBS, IgM isotype or mAb 3E7b at 24 h and 8 h prior to infection with CHIKV of 4 105 PFU via i.p. injection route. infected mice were monitored daily for their (A) survival and other clinical symtoms of CHIKV disease. hind limbs were harvested at day 7 p.i, paraformaldehyde-fixed and procesed for hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. the skeletal muscles of 3E7b-treated mice showed extensive necrosis with loss of striations. 6-day old mice were infected with 4 105 PFU of CHIKV prior to receiving a single 20 g dose of 3E7b at 4 h or 8 h p.i. for mice post-treated with 3E7b at 8 h p.i., survival was improved to 50% (p 0.05) however, when given at 4 h p.i., 3E7b was significantly effective (p 0.01), protecting all mice against CHIKV- allis test was performed across all treatment followed by a Dunn's post test to PBS infected control. 3E7b was significantly effective (p 0.01) in reducing viral loads in the serum (Fig. 8B), liver (Fig. 8E) and spleen (Fig. 8F), while a lower significance is observed in the brain (Fig. 8D) we inoculated live CHIKV in mice to generate envelope protein-specific mAbs that could confer strong neutralization potency. the most potent anti-CHIKV mAb previously described, CHK-152 IgG, has an in vitro IC50 of 1\u20133 ng/ml in vero and mouse fibroblast cells. escape mutant CHIKV, namely, E24D, N218D and D233G, were generated from 10 neutralization rounds under 3E7b selective pressure. they collectively localized to surface-exposed regions on CHIKV E2 ectodomain with high solvent accessibility. the role of IgM in CHIKV neutralization has yet to be reported in other CHIKV-specific IgG studies. however, the residue might be an important antigenic determinant involved in alphavirus neutralization. 3E7b was found to cross-react with CHIKV Ross strain at a lower neutralization potency. the lack of neutralization efficacy against RRV and SINV could be due to sequence differences in E2 antigenicity that involved other neutralizing epitopes. es infection has revealed the potential usefulness of IgM as a diagnostic tool especially during endemics. there are no prior studies done on understanding the use of CHIKV-specific IgM as an immunotherapy in patients and animal models. mice showed healthy limb muscle morphology, contrasting necrosis and inflammation. a single dose of 20 g at 3E7b was administered at 4 h or 8 h after CHIKV challenge. a single dose of 20 g at 3E7b was administered to the mice at 4 h or 8 h. 3E7b protects mice from CHIKV disease, including CHIKV-induced myalgia. fab fragments of 3E7b can be derived for use in antibody docking on cryo-EM map of CHIKV to better elucidate the neutralization mechanism. CHIKV Ross (GenBank Accession number: AF490259) and RRV (ATCC) were also used in the PRNT. confluent C6/36 cells were infected with local CHIKV strains, CHIKV Ross, RRV or SINV. all animal experiments were reviewed and approved by IACUC. ascites production was performed according to the protocol approved by IACUC. all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering and euthanasia was performed using an overdose of carbon dioxide. purified mAb was isotyped with isostrip mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping kits. final mAb purity and yield were analyzed by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis and BCA assay. wells were washed with PBST buffer (PBS with 0.01% Tween-20) and anti-CHIKV IgG buffer was added. mouse mAb anti-CHIKV IgG was added to each well. antibody staining was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-CHIKV E2 IgG at 1:300 dilution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. goat anti-mouse IgG FITC at 1:500 dilution for the next 1 h. CHIKV (CH122508 strain) was mixed with equal volume (1:1) of mAb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after infection, cells were overlaid with 1% carboxymethylcellulose. after 72 h p.i., cells were stained with crystal violet dye containing 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma-Aldrich, 158127) RRV-infected cells were crystal violet dye-fixed at 72 h p.i. and SINV-infected cells were fixed after 48 h p.i. post-binding neutralization assay BHK-21 cells of 100% confluency were prechilled to 4\u00b0C. cells were then gently washed twice with cold PBS, followed by incubation with mAb 3E7b or IgM isotype at 0.25 g/ml diluted supernatant was harvested from the wells with the highest dilution of virus that showed extensive CPE of 80-100%. at every 2 to 3 consecutive passage, viral supernatant was incubated with increasing concentration of 3E7b at 0.5 g/ml, 1 g/ml or 2.5 g/ml. after the 10th passage, the harvested viral supernatant was plaque-purified in BHK cells. Purified PCR products were sequenced at CHIKV E1 or E2 gene. resulting sequences were analyzed using seqTrace software. computational analyses of neutralization epitopes CHIKV E1/E2 protein structure of CH122508 strain predicted based on published CHIKV mature glycoprotein complex. transformed culture was spread onto LB agar supplemented with 30 g/ml kanamycin (MP Biomedicals, 0219453105) and incubated overnight at 30\u00b0C. positive clones were DNA sequenced using CHIKV E2 forward primer to confirm the presence of desired mutation. gene sequencing of entire length of CHIKV mutant cDNA clone was performed using a set of optimized CHIKV-specific primers established previously. 5-day old neonate mice were pre-treated with 0.2 g, 2 g, 20 g or 200 g of anti-CHIKV 3E7b or a purified mouse IgM isotype diluted in sterile PBS or mock-treated with PBS. mice were monitored and scored daily for sign and symptom of CHIKV disease. a clinical score of 6 or death was determined as endpoint of the study. at the end of 2 weeks, the number of survivals were noted. n = 5 or 6 mice used in our study are determined to have sufficient statistical power to detect at a significant level of 0.05. chikungunya virus SGEHICHD122508 (GenBank Accession number: FJ445502) or named as CH122508 was used in mice experiments because this virus strain produced better clinical manifestations of CHIKV infection compared to CH122508 strain. confluent C6/36 cells were infected with local CHIKV strains, CHIKV Ross, RRV or SINV and maintained for 72 h to 96 h post-infection (p.i.) a large pool of CH122508 strain was grown up from 10 T75 flasks of C6/36 cells. three-week old female BALB/c mouse (n = 5) were intraperitoneally injected with 800 l of CH122508 strain (5 107 PFU) for 3 times consecutively at 1-week interval. mouse spleen was harvested and splenocytes were fused with myeloma cells according to the instructions in ClonaCell-HY Hybridoma Cloning kit. cells on coverslips were infected with CHIKV CH122508 strain or single mutant CHIKV clones at MOI 10. cells were fixed with methanol at 20\u00b0C, washed extensively with PBS and stained with mouse anti-CHIKV IgM, 3E7b or 8A2c at 1:100 dilution. wells were washed twice with PBST and anti-CHIKV IgM diluted to 0.1, 5, 10, 25, 50 or 100 ng. mouse mAb anti-CHIKV E2 8A4 IgG or mouse IgM isotype clone GC323 (Millipore, MABC008) was added to each well. OD values were read at 450 nM using Tecan plate reader. cells were fixed with methanol at 20\u00b0C and stained with mouse anti-CHIKV IgM, 3E7b or 8A2c at 1:100 dilution in PBS. secondary antibody staining was performed with goat anti-mouse IgM FITC (Pierce, 31992) or anti-rabbit DyLight 594 conjugate at 1:300 or 1:500 dilution. concentration of CHIKV IgM was pre-quantitated by BCA assay. wells were washed with a final round in PBST for 3 times. negative controls consisting of \u201cIgM + no CHIKV antigen coated\u201d and blank wells consisting of \u201cno IgM + no antigen coating\u201d were included. primary antibody staining was performed using mouse monoclonal anti-CHIKV E2 IgG at 1:300 dilution for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. goat anti-mouse IgG FITC (Pierce, 31992) at 1:500 dilution for the next 1 h. cells were stained with crystal violet dye containing 4% paraformaldehyde. CHIKV Neutralization was calculated by expressing plaque number per mAb dilution as a percentage of plaques formed in PBS diluent. cells were washed with PBS twice and maintained in RPMI with 2% FCS. at 72 h p.i., cells were fixed with crystal violet dye and scored for plaques. CHIKV infection was carried out at 37\u00b0C for 1.5 h. CHIKV (CH122508 strain) of 100 PFU was mixed with equal volume (1:1) of mAb for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. after 72 h p.i., cells were stained with crystal violet dye containing 4% paraformaldehyde. CHIKV Ross- and RRV-infected cells were crystal violet dye-fixed at 72 h p.i., while SINV-infected cells were fixed after 48 h p.i. post-binding neutralization assay BHK-21 cells of 100% confluency were prechilled to 4\u00b0C. cells were then gently washed twice with cold PBS, followed by incubation with mAb 3E7b or IgM isotype at 0. viral supernatant was incubated with increasing concentration of 3E7b at 0.5 g/ml, 1 g/ml or 2.5 g/ml. after the 10th passage, the harvested viral supernatant was plaque-purified in BHK cells. after 48 h to 72 h p.i, visible plaques were isolated individually. PCR products were electrophoresed, gel extracted and spin-column purified according to manufacturer's protocol (Qiagen, 28106). purified PCR products were digested using long PCR enzyme mix (ThermoScientific, K0181) transformed culture was spread onto LB agar supplemented with 30 g/ml kanamycin (MP Biomedicals, 0219453105) and incubated overnight at 30\u00b0C. positive clones were DNA sequenced using CHIKV E2 forward primer. 2508 full-length genomic DNA pSMART-LCKan vector (Lucigen, 40821-2; GenBank Accession number: AF532106) were constructed. each pair of forward and reverse primer contains the desired single-base escape mutation in E2 (E24D, N218D and D223G) PCR products were digested by Dpn-I (NEB, R0176S) at 37\u00b0C for 6 h. plasmid was subjected to IVT reaction using mMESSAGE mMACHINE T7 transcription kit (Life Technologies, AM1344). the transcribed RNA was recovered using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, 74106) and quantitated at 260 nm. neonate mice were given CHIKV by i.p injection, followed by administration of 3E7b, IgM isotype or PBS at 8 h or 4 h p.i. mice were sacrificed at 48 h p.i. by CO2 overdose and whole blood, brain, spleen, liver and muscle of the hind limbs were harvested for quantification of CHIKV titer by virus plaque assay. sample size (n) required in time to event occurrence is calculated using the following equation:66 n = C p c q c + p e q e d 2 + 2 d + 2 Here, pc is defined as the estimated proportion of mice in the control group that will succumb to CHIKV infection. d is given as pc\u2013qc and C is 10.51 given a significance level of 0.05 and confidence level of 90%. b-07-06-1083664-s001.docx (1.2MB)"}
