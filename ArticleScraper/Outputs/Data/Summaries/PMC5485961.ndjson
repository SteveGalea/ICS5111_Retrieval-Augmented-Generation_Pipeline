{"summary": "introduction 2.1. Origin of Oxidation: The Importance of Natural Antioxidants Vegetables and fruits are an important source for therapeutic products. a free radical is a species which contains one or more unpaired electrons, which makes them very reactive as they need another electron to fill the orbital and become more stable. antioxidants scavenge free radicals by capturing metal ions, reducing hydroperoxides, hydrogen peroxide and quenching superoxide and singlet oxygen. a second line of defence is formed by vitamin C and vitamin E which scavenge radicals and so prevent propagation reactions. natural antioxidants are found, above all, in vegetables, herbs, berries, spices, tea, coffee and cocoa. the most used synthetic antioxidants in the food industry are: butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate (PG) and di-tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) rose hips are rich in vitamins, especially, vitamin C, as well as phenolic compounds, carotenoids, tocopherol, bioflavonoids, tannins, volatile oils and pectins. the pseudo-fruits from the plants of the Rosa genus in the Rosaceae family have been used both for alimentation and for medicinal purposes. vitamin C/Kg of dry fruit was found in Rosa canina rose hips. this concentration was six times higher than those found by demir et al. [15] in Rosa canina. quercetin was a potent melanogenesis inhibitor in mouse melanoma cells. the inhibition of melanogenesis by quercetin was due to the inhibition of both tyrosinase activity and of the protein expression. authors of this study concluded native rose genotypes are extremely rich in phenols and ascorbic acid. they found that the greatest amount of phenolic compounds corresponded to Rosa dumalis subsp boissiere (52.94 mg gallic acid/g dry weight) the rest showed very similar concentrations of around 30 mg gallic acid/g dry weight. denev et al. studied the concentration of major polyphenol and anthocyanin contents of fruit extract and the antioxidant properties of six fruits. rose hip extract showed the highest antioxidant activity via Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC), Total Peroxyl Radical Trapping Potential (TRAP) and Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity (HORAC) assay. a similar study was carried out by barros et al. [43] in which they made an evaluation of the antioxidant properties of Rosa canina hips seed, petals, flowers and galls. they found that galls proved to have the greatest antioxidant activity, ripen hips showed the highest content of tocopherols and -carotene, unripe hips gave the highest levels of ascorbic acid. fromm et al. [51] studied seed oils from different Rosaceae species. it was found that qualitative and quantitative composition of tocopherols and carotenoids differed significantly between different genera and also among cultivars of the same species. tocopherol content and vitamin E activity varied depending on date of harvesting, species and year. rose hip seed oil has been used in cosmetics because of its therapeutic effect on skin disorders. unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid) were extracted to a maximum of 35.9\u201354.7% using microwave. some galactolipids were isolated from Rosa canina hips. glyceroglycolipid 1,2-di-O--linolenoyl-3-O--d-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol was found in vitro and in vivo to be a potent nitric oxide (NO scavenger) dLGG treatment inhibited both mRNA and protein expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX the extracts of rose hips were found to be very active against an enteric coronavirus. the extracts of Rosa nutkunu and Amelunchier alnifoliu were found to be very active against a coronavirus. different factors could influence the content of phytochemicals in rose hips. a range of variability could be due to the ascorbic acid instability. many factors could affect vitamin C content of rose hips. frost stimulates the formation of -carotene and lycopene in Rosa canina hips. but it reduces the concentration of ascorbic acid and some quercetin glycosides. antioxidant ability decreased in frostbitten rose hips. the formation of lipid hydroperoxides was 2.5 times higher in the control canola oil compared to the fortified sample with Rosa woodsii extract. the addition of Rosa rubiginosa shell extract gave great stability to canola oil. a free radical is a species which contains one or more unpaired electrons. many of these radicals in vivo are produced by incomplete transfer of electrons on O2. the superoxide radical (O2\u2022), which is very active, is formed when a single electron is added to the ground state molecule. antioxidants scavenge free radicals through different mechanisms like Hydrogen Atom Transfer (HAT), Single Electron Transfer followed by Proton Transfer (SET or ET-PT) and the Sequential Proton Loss Electron Transfer (SPLET) mechanism. each one of these mechanisms presents different kinetics. the most used synthetic antioxidants in the food industry are butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT), propyl gallate (PG) and di-tert-butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) the most used synthetic antioxidants in the food processing industry are: butylhydroxyanisole (BHA), butylhydroxytoluene (BHT) and propyl gallate (PG) Rosa genus contains around 100 species which are widely spread across Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North America. the pseudo-fruits from Rosa species have been used both for alimentation and for medicinal purposes thanks to their high level of bioactive compounds. phenolic compounds are synthesized in plants through carbohydrates. they are generally produced as a defence mechanism of plants against pathogens. they are characterized by at least one aromatic ring with one or more hydroxyl groups attached. Rosa canina extracts includes two phenolic compounds derivatives of kaempferol (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and kaempferol-7-O-glucoside) the highest total phenolic content corresponded to Rosa canina (96 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight) and Rosa pulverulenta (923 mg ascorbic acid/100 mL) the authors found a high concentration of catechin, procyanidin B2 and epicatechin gallate in Rosa dumalis subsp boissiere. they found that the major phenolic compounds of Rosa woodsii fruit extracts were gallic acid, catechin and quercetin. rose hip extract showed the highest antioxidant activity via Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC), Total Peroxyl Radical Trapping Potential (TRAP) and Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity (HORAC) assay. blueberry extract was the most potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. highest content of tocopherols and -carotene, unripe hips gave the highest levels of ascorbic acid. petals had the highest concentration of sugars. lipid-soluble antioxidants are also found in Rosa species. d ranged from 597.7 mg/kg from one sample of quince to 1099.9 mg/kg of rose hip. tocopherol content and vitamin E activity varied depending on the date of harvesting, species and year. phenolic compounds are synthesized in plants through the carbohydrates. they are generally produced as a defence mechanism of the plants against pathogens and as a protection against an excess of ultraviolet radiation. the compounds are characterized by at least one aromatic ring. Rosa canina extracts includes two phenolic compounds derivatives of kaempferol (kaempferol 3-O-glucoside and kaempferol-7-O-glucoside) the highest total phenolic content corresponded to Rosa canina (96 mg gallic acid equivalents/g dry weight) and Rosa pulverulenta (94 mg ascorbic acid equivalents/g dry weight) authors found a high concentration of catechin, procyanidin B2 and epicatechin gallate in Rosa dumalis subsp boissiere. they found that the major phenolic compounds of Rosa woodsii fruit extracts were gallic acid, catechin and quercetin. this coincides with the results of Abdel-Hameed et al. [38] in Rosa damascena extracts. rose hip extract showed the highest antioxidant activity via Oxygen Radical Absorbance Capacity (ORAC), Total Peroxyl Radical Trapping Potential (TRAP) and Hydroxyl Radical Averting Capacity (HORAC) assay. blueberry extract was the most potent inhibitor of lipid peroxidation. ripe hips gave the highest levels of ascorbic acid and petals had the highest concentration of sugars. lipid-soluble antioxidants in Rosa species are also lipid-soluble antioxidants such as carotenoids and tocopherols. carotenoids act as provitamin A and can prevent certain chronic diseases and even cancer. andersson et al. studied the concentration of tocopherol and tocotrienol in four different species of Rosa (Rosa dumalis, Rosa rubiginosa, Rosa spinosissima, Rosa pimpinellifolia) and only found - and -tocopherol in the fleshy parts of the rose hips. tocopherol content and vitamin E activity varied depending on the date of harvesting, species and year. unsaturated fatty acids (oleic, linoleic and linolenic acid) were extracted to a maximum of 35.9\u201354.7% using microwave and polyunsaturated fatty acid (linoleic and linolenic acid) were found between 60% and 90% in the recovered oils. some galactolipids were isolated from Rosa canina hips. bioactive glyceroglycolipid 1,2-di-O--linolenoyl-3-O--galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol was found in vitro and in vivo to be a potent nitric oxide (NO) scavenger. dLGG treatment inhibited both mRNA and protein expression of inducible NO synthase and cyclooxygenase-2 ( extract and fractions obtained from earlier extracts of Rosa canina L. fruits. nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium contents varied from 19.039 to 28.076 ppm (N), from 553 to 1080 ppm (P), and from 1142 to 2945 ppm (K) iron, manganese, zinc, copper, magnesium, and calcium were also analysed. dried rose hips had less ascorbic acid content than fresh rose hips. more recently, Baiano and del Nobile concluded that the quantity of vitamin C in vegetables depends on several factors such as the plant variety, soil condition, climate, the length of time since it had been picked. the addition of Rosa canina rose hips as a functional ingredient in porcine frankfurters acts as a partial substitute for sodium nitrate. phenolic compounds of rose hip are useful for preventing or delaying oxidation in very saturated oils. the addition of a phenolic-rich dog rose extracts (Rosa canina L.) inhibited the formation of AAS, AAA and had an antioxidant effect on tryptophan oxidation. rose hip is an interesting therapeutic option for those disorders which involve oxidative stress and/or a pro-inflammatory status. the role of rose hip in cancer treatment has been widely tested among a wide variety of cancer cell lines. the antitumor potential of rose hip is supposed to be a consequence of its phytochemical composition, which may vary attending to the factors described above. the anticancer properties of Rosa canina have been evaluated in various cancer cell lines as shown in Table 1 [14,21,85] the therapeutic use of Rosa canina may be limited to glycolytic cancer and should be avoided in oestrogen-dependent tumours. some phytochemicals contained in Rosa canina could mimic the mechanism of action of 1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D3 an. alogues tested against myeloid leukaemia found that Rosa rugosa extracts inhibited human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP growth due to its anti-histone acetyltransferase activity. androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-dependent transcription factor which acts as a key molecule for prostate cancer proliferation. crude polysaccharides extracted from Rosa roxburghii induced strong cytotoxicity on epithelial ovarian cancer A2780 cell line. incubation with crude polysaccharides led to a decreased expression of matrix metalloprotease-9 (MMP-9) a proteolytic enzyme upregulated in certain tumours, including ovarian cancer, and it is associated with poor prognosis due to its capacity in degrading some components of the extracellular matrix. different combinations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) and biologic agents are used for the treatment of symptoms. but new drugs are needed since some patients do not respond successfully and the traditional treatments cause serious side effects in others. NF-B related inflammatory response Phytosterols -sitosterol Attenuation of NF-B phosphorylation Choi et al. [115] Gallic acid Reestablishment IB and NF-B association Choi et al. rose hips have been shown to reduce chemotaxis of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes. rose hips have been shown to reduce the production of several key pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-, IL-1, IL-6, (IFN-, IL-12) and chemokines CCL5 (RANTES), IP-10 (CXCL10) NF-B regulates a wide variety of biological processes including immunity, inflammation, and apoptosis. in RA, imbalanced production of pro-inflammatory mediators and oxidative damage promote a chronic activation of NF-B pathway. rose hip extract inhibits activation of NF-B mediated by RANKL. NF-B could constitute bioactive molecule against bone destruction in RA. osteoporosis is a common disease characterized by a decrease in bone mass and strength. antioxidants contained in blueberries reduced femoral mRNA levels of alkaline phosphatase, collagen type I, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and the levels of serum mRNA of osteocalcin. this treatment also reduced loss of whole-body BMD and prevented the loss of tibial and femoral BMD [124] diabetes mellitus is the most common endocrine disorder and its incidence is rising year by year. hyperglycemia induces overproduction of superoxide by the mitochondrial electron-transport chain, which increases hexosamine pathway flux, enhances the formation of advanced glycosylation end products and activates protein kinase C. Rosa canina extract with the concentration of 0.001 mg/mL significantly increased proliferation of TC6 cell line compared with control cells. the results were supported by Orhan et al. [133] who found that R-H2O fraction of Rosa canina fruits reduced blood glucose level significantly in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats. rose hip extracts down regulated the hepatic lipogenic program, resulting in a reduction of >50% of the hepatic lipids. the mechanisms underlying these effects remain unknown and further investigations are needed. acetone extracts from the fruit (50 mg/kg/day and seeds) of Rosa canina significantly reduced plasma triglyceride (TG) and free fatty acid (FFA) levels. trans-tiliroside increased the expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR-) levels in liver tissue 24 h after single oral administration. the oil from the seeds of rose hip contains polyunsaturated fatty acids -3 and -6 which decrease plasma TG levels. polyunsaturated fatty acids prevent the binding of the LXR/RR heterodimer to the regulatory regions LXREs contained in SREBP-1c promoter. adipocytes dysfunction results in increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. anti-obesity properties of trans-tiliroside (kaempferol 3-O-(6\u2032\u2032-p-coumaroyl)--glucoside) also found to increase after trans-tiliroside administration. trans-tiliroside anti-obese effects are related to an increase in lipid metabolism linked to a decrease in adipogenesis. this decrease in ROS levels seems to be related to an increase in certain redox enzymes including superoxide dismutase or glutathione peroxidase. nephropathy (DN) is one of the most common diabetes-associated injuries. treatment with Rosa laevigata reduced reactive oxygen species levels via increasing superoxide dismutase levels-like Zhao et al. [155] observed-, which eventually resulted in an ameliorative effect from renal injury. all data collected by Tayefi-Nasrabadi et al. show the potential therapeutic role of Rosa canina in prevention and even treatment of nephrolithiasis. hepatotoxicity Liver plays a key role in metabolism, detoxification and energy storage in animals. Rosa damascena is one of the most promising medicinal plants for Alzheimer treatment. flavonoid myricetin has shown the most relevant anti-Alzheimer potential. flavonoid supplementation has been confirmed as a therapeutic tool for epileptogenesis. the anticonvulsant and neuroprotective effects from Rosa damascena were resumed by Homayoun et al. [171] using a rat model. dark neurons are commonly observed in brain-related diseases. their apparition seems to be linked to oxidative stress, so the neuroprotective effect of Rosa damascena may be caused by its antioxidant activity. anti-AD activity of Rosa multiflora seems to be related to its anti-inflammatory properties. application of extracts reduced mRNA levels of inflammatory mediators cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase (iNOS) melanin is responsible for the pigmentation of human skin, hair and eyes. but its excessive biosynthesis leads to skin disorders like age spots or melanoma. the key enzyme in this process is tyrosinase and quercetin from Rosa canina was found to be capable of inhibiting its activity. antioxidant compounds and poly-unsaturated fatty acids are the major contributors to the anti-aging effect of rose hip. PPAR- is involved in inflammatory processes, since its activation leads to an inhibition of pro-inflammatory genes expression like matrix metalloproteases (MMP) the normal function of MMP has been described earlier, which includes degrading components of extracellular matrix [96] despite advances of modern medicine, the world health organization encouraged studies for the treatment and prevention of diarrheal diseases depending on traditional medical practices. in vivo studies showed that the methanol extract Rosa canina had a significant antidiarrhoeal activity mediated by an antisecretory mechanism that induce a fluid accumulation comparable to that obtained with the standard drug, diphenoxylate. treatment with Rosa canina prevented gastric mucosa erosion and avoided haemorrhagic ulcer formation. they propose that the antioxidant activity of rose hip extracts was responsible for the results obtained. lipid peroxidation and ROS production are highly involved in gastric damage. antibacterial effect of some Rosa species displayed as percentage of growth inhibition. Rosa Species Bacteria Strain MIC (mg/mL) reference R. canina E. coli 8110 0.1 Kumarasamy et al. lycopene prevents oxidative stress-induced DNA damage in infected gastric cells and consequently inhibits apoptosis. lycopene prevents oxidative stress-induced DNA damage in infected gastric cells and consequently inhibits apoptosis. urease normal function consists of urea hydrolysis to ammonium and carbon dioxide. this results in pH alkalization that promotes calcium crystals and magnesium ammonium phosphates stones formation. phenolic content of Rosa indica are the most likely urease inhibitor agents. tannins from Rosa rugosa did not alter bifidobacteria or lactobacilli growth. the antiviral effect of rose hip has been less investigated. but some interesting research has also been performed in this field. antiretroviral therapies are a combination of two or three drugs. they include nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, protease inhibitors, chemokine receptor 5 antagonists and/or fusion inhibitors. therapy does not completely eradicate HIV and virus mutations are an additional complication. Rosa Species Yeast Strain % Inhibition Reference R. damascena C. albicans 98.87 Talib et al. [192]. \u00e9nez et al. [21] showed that antiproliferative effects of Rosa canina extracts were mainly due to their phenolic content. non-anthocyanin phenolic compounds enriched extracts showed greater antioxidant activity and provided higher GI50 values than anthocyanins enriched extracts. the therapeutic use of Rosa canina may be limited to glycolytic cancer. antiproliferative effects of extracts from rose hip were observed on myeloblastic leukaemia cell model (HL60 cells) and to a lesser extent on myelomonocytic leukaemia model (U937 cells), alone or combined with other plant extracts. this synergy effect demonstrates that Rosa rugosa extracts may have a promising future in therapy alone or as an adjuvant. it is still unclear if this anti-histone acetylation activity is due to the action of a particular compound, as yet unidentified. rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic systemic disease that affects 22.7% of the adult population. it is most commonly seen between the ages of 20 and 50. prevalence is higher in women (23.9%) than in men (18.6%) olenoyl-3-O--d-galactopyranosyl-sn-glycerol-sn-glycerol Reduction in peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes, neutrophils and monocytes migration Reduction in the levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) rose hip powder has been shown to reduce symptoms associated with rheumatoid inflammation in clinical trials. this effect is related to its high content in anti-inflammatory molecules. rose hip powder has been shown to reduce symptoms associated with rheumatoid inflammation in clinical trials. inflammatory process triggered by RA has been associated with increased generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) antioxidant nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids, polyphenols and antioxidant enzymes could play a significant role in the protection against the damaging effects of ROS/RNS produced in RA. osteoclast differentiation is dependent on cytokines and membrane-bound factors expressed by T cells. aqueous extract of rose hip has been found to inhibit the activation of NF-B mediated by RANKL and slow down osteoclastogenesis. antioxidant supplementation can contribute to restoring Bone Mineral Density (BMD) by regulating levels of oxidative stress. blueberries reduced femoral mRNA levels of alkaline phosphatase, collagen type I, tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase and the levels of serum mRNA of osteocalcin. antioxidants play a key role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. AA can potentially bind putative antioxidant-responsive elements (ARE) contained in osteoblastic and osteocitic genes, such as osterix, and induce their expression. no study has yet showed this activity by Rosa spp. extracts. gene damage activates the nuclear enzyme poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase. depletion of NAD+ slows the rate of glycolysis, electron transport, and ATP formation. these processes result in acute endothelial dysfunction that also contributes to the development of diabetic complications. rose hip extract was not able to modify glucose uptake in the hepatic cell line HepG2. in diabetes, hyperglycaemia is also associated with more glycogenesis. rose hip extracts down regulated the hepatic lipogenic program. the inhibition of -amylase is lower than the repression on -glucosidase activity. as -glucosidase activity is highly repressed, rapid glucose release to bloodstream is prevented, contributing to the regulation of blood sugar level. the results were confirmed by Taghizadeh et al. (2016) who found that the administration of Rosa canina extract in rats at a dose of 250 mg/kg body weight significantly decreased the levels of serum triglycerides. serum cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein, and high-density lipoprotein levels were not modified. phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase or diacylglycerol catalyses phosphatidate to DG and DG to TG. polyunsaturated fatty acids can also inhibit the synthesis and release of decrease hepatic lipoprotein (VLDL)-TG. on the other hand, polyunsaturated fatty acids can suppress the expression of hepatic lipase and Apo CIII. lipid metabolism was found to increase after trans-tiliroside administration. PPAR decreases lipid levels, as its activation promotes fatty acids oxidation. PPAR is implicated in lipid homeostasis and insulin sensitivity control. the previously described antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of rose hip make it an interesting therapeutic option for AKI. the previously described antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of rose hip make it an interesting therapeutic option for AKI. calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis is a polygenic disorder whose incidence is rising worldwide every day. despite its importance, hepatic diseases are lacking in effective treatments nowadays. herbal medicines are one of the main options for prevention and therapy. hepatic injury is turned into increased serum levels of ALT, AST and ALP proteins. treatment with the fruit extract of Rosa canina at 500 and 750 mg/kg doses restored the levels of these marker enzymes in a model of hepatic injury induced by CCl4. flavonoid myricetin has shown the most relevant anti-Alzheimer potential. it is able to avoid amyloid formation and has certain tau-antagonist activity. oxidative stress is linked to other neurodegenerative diseases such as epilepsy. high antioxidant content of rose hip makes it a potential and powerful help for treatment of depression. atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory disorder that affects children. anti-AD activity of Rosa multiflora seems to be related to its anti-inflammatory properties. the most likely candidate to act against AD is the condensed tannin RM-3. RM-3 is the most abundant phytochemical in Rosa multiflora root extract. the previously discussed antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties of rose hip make it a promising aid in reducing these skin aging signs. rose hip powder reduced the depths of crow\u2019s-feet wrinkles, increased moisture content of forehead and improved skin elasticity. the anti-aging effects of Rosa canina are related to its antioxidant properties. vitamin C might have a dual role in skin protection since as well as its antioxidant effect. rose hip oil inhalation resulted in a decrease in transepidermial water loss. methanol extract Rosa canina had antidiarrheal activity mediated by an antisecretory mechanism that induce a fluid accumulation comparable to that obtained with diphenoxylate. anti-ulcerogenic effect from Rosa canina extracts was first discovered by G\u00fcrb\u00fcz et al. [190] by inducing ulcerogenesis on rat models. treatment with Rosa canina prevented gastric mucosa erosion and avoided haemorrhagic ulcer formation. the antibacterial effect of some rose hip species was roughly investigated in Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria strains [192,193,194,195,196] results from Olech et al. [195] focus on the correlation between antioxidant capacity from rose hip extracts\u2014due to their phenolic content\u2014and their antibacterial potential.

Rosa genus is a natural source of antioxidants with a potential use in disease prevention and treatment. it stands out for its high content in polyphenols (such as garlic acid, catechin and quercetin), vitamins C, E, B and carotenoids (-carotenoid, lycopene -cryptozanthin, rubizanthin, zeazanthin and lutein) rose hip extracts have shown a protective effect in other disorders associated with a disruption in redox balance such as AKI, DN, hepatotoxicity or peptic ulcer disease. antioxidants and vitamin E contained in rose hip extracts could ameliorate secondary complications of this disease. ascena extracts, especially the flavonoid myricetin, avoid amyloid formation and hence they can be neuroprotective in Alzheimer. antioxidants and essential oils found in Rosa damascena proved its potential in depression managing. phenols contained in rose hip extracts have an antibacterial activity, being able to increase membrane permeabilisation and nutrient deprivation. chemical Disease of Application Mechanism of Action References Ascorbic acid Cancer Anti-inflammatory effect Contribution to skin and collagen formation Phetcharat et al.
