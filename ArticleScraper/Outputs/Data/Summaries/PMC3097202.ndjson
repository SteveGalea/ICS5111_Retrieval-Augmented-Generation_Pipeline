concentrations of PAHs are reported in Tables 3, 5 and 6. the total lack of haplotype diversity among samples collected within the Mediterranean Sea implies some degree of population isolation, small effective population size or perhaps a reduction in maternal lineages brought on by a recent bottleneck event [20], [21]. the low levels of haplotype variability found in this investigation was also reported in previous studies [22]. the tissue isotopic variability observed in this study can account for differences in short- and long-term diet, due to a different cellular turnover. sperm whales are known to have a wide habitat range on the offshore part of the continental slope, albeit having a very specialized diet on cephalopods. the only relevant anomaly reported by the marine data archives was the increased sea superficial temperature in November and December along the Hellenic Trench and Eastern part of the Adriatic Sea. this may have been a thermal front in which upwelling and/or downwelling could have been favorable to the development of cephalopod populations. tric cavities are in open contrast with the feeding habits and daily intake typical of the species [36], thus suggesting a starvation period of at least 3 to 7 days [11], [36], an amount of time compatible with the traveling time. foreign bodies (including fishing gears and hooks, ropes, and plastic objects) were found in all the examined stomachs, with an incidence higher than those reported for other mass strandings. an impairment of the immune response was strongly suspected on the basis of the prominent lymphoid cell depletion in several lymph nodes. the primary cause of lymphoid depletion remains uncertain. the lack of pathological changes in all tissues examined supports the hypothesis of a recently acquired infection. previous studies on harbor porpoises confirmed the existence of a relationship between lymphoid cell depletion in lymphatic tissues and elevated persistent organic pollutant body burdens. the direct impact of acoustic sources or a seaquake that could have caused the onset of the \u201cgas and fat embolic syndrome\u201d was considered as another possible cause of death. this suspicion was ruled out, since the three fully examined whales showed no evidences of lipid and gas emboli. this process can result in gas entering the pulmonary veins and lymphatic vessels. this leads progressively to general hypoxia and cardio-pulmonary hypertension and failure. the second option suggests that the large and unexpected journey of these deep diving whales could enable free gas offloading from tissues, worsened by stranding. mercury enters the blood circle and spreads to all main target organs. low protein diet feeding, particularly with low sulfur amino-acids, are suspected to decrease urinary Hg excretion and simultaneously increase the retention of MeHg metabolite in renal cells. the deposition of inorganic mercury as black auto-metallograpic positive granules within the cytoplasm of macrophages residing in the enlarged, brown to black-pigmented prescapular lymph nodes sperm whales swam northward toward a dead end and soon found themselves starving. the cetaceans swam northward toward a dead end and soon found themselves starving. toxicological investigations on the main persistent organic pollutants (POPs) showed increased levels of PCBs and DDT metabolites. sperm whale pods stranded along the Adriatic Sea coastline in the past. the sperm whale pods were stranded on the Gargano Promontory. a detailed postmortem investigation was carried out on sperm whales. a complete sampling of all organs and tissues was performed by the Necropsy Unit for later microscopic examinations. extensive samplings were performed on all the seven animals for age determination, genetic analyses and stable isotope analyses. the total number of GLGs in each of the seven tooth sections was determined in three sessions by four independent readers. genetics Skin samples were collected from ten Mediterranean sperm whales. the best photos of each of the seven stranded whales were compared with all the available photos from three sperm whale photographic databases. the total number of known individuals in the Mediterranean Sea is relatively small (few hundreds) three whales underwent a full necropsy were formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded, cut into 5 m thick sections and stained with hematoxylin and eosin for routine light microscopic evaluation. periodic acid Schiff, Gram and Giemsa stainings were also performed to assess the evidence of any biological agent within the tissues. macro-parasites were collected, stored in 70% ethanol, and morphologically studied by light microscope and stereomicroscope. DNA extracts were subjected to a nested PCR specific for the B1 gene of Toxoplasma gondii. successful PCR products were purified directly and sequenced using a Taq DyeDeoxyTerminator cycle sequencing kit in an ABI-PRISM model 377 sequencer. Accuracy was achieved by two-directional sequencing and all electropherograms were manually checked and edited. biotoxins Lipophilic (okadaic acid, dinophysistoxins, pectenotoxins, yessotoxins, adriatoxin and azaspiracids) bio was studied on livers, kidneys and muscles of whales no. 5, 6 and 7, prescapular lymph nodes and brainstem of no. 6 by isolating it from tissues with the addition of HCl, followed by extraction with toluene. lipid content of the extracted organic material was determined by gravimetry. samples of blubber, liver and muscle (about 2 g) were lyophilized in an Edwards freeze drier for 2 days and extracted with n-hexane for gas chromatography (Merck) each sample was spiked with surrogate compound (2,4,6-trichlorobiphenyls - IUPAC number 30) before extraction. the extract was then purified with sulphuric acid to obtain a first lipid sedimentation. Capillary gaschromatography revealed op\u2032- and pp\u2032- isomers of DDT and its derivatives DDD and DDE, and about 30 PCB congeners. total PCBs were quantified as the sum of all congeners. a multidisciplinary and wide range investigation was performed to assess any possible causes reported as temporally and spatially associated to mass strandings of sperm whales. a multidisciplinary and wide range investigation was performed to assess any possible causes reported as temporally and spatially associated to mass strandings of sperm whales. the INGV also provided us with information on past seaquakes and geomagnetic field abnormalities (www.earthquake.rm.ingv.it), while information on solar activity and cycles was obtained from the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. historical data sets on cetacean strandings along the southern Adriatic Sea coastline were obtained from the Italian Stranding Database. the best photos of each of the seven stranded whales were compared with all the available photos from three sperm whale photographic databases. the total number of known individuals in the Mediterranean Sea is relatively small (few hundreds) otope ratio mass spectrometer (DeltaPlus XP) interfaced in continuous flow to a Thermo Scientific Elemental Analyzer (EA 1112) Isotopic values were expressed in notation as parts per thousand () differences from international standards. analytical precision was 0.2 and 0.1 for 15N and 13C, respectively. s stain was used to evaluate the presence of lipofuscin pigments. post-fixation of lung samples stored in buffered formalin in osmium tetroxide (OsO4) was employed to detect fat emboli. of 10 min at 95\u00b0C, 35 cycles, each of 60 sec at 94\u00b0C, 60 sec at 50\u00b0C (first step) or 54\u00b0C (second step), 60 sec at 72\u00b0C, with a final extension of 10 min at 72\u00b0C. conditions for the second step mixture were identical to those for the primary PCR. total mercury (TotHg), Se and Cd, was evaluated using an atomic absorbance spectrophotometer in muscles of all the animals. the solution obtained was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy. organic mercury (in particular methyl-mercury, MeHg) was studied on livers, kidneys and muscles of animals no. 5, 6 and 7. initial gradient was 60% acetonitrile and increased to 100% over 20min. Flow-rate was 1 ml/min. the external standard consisted of 16PAHs from Supelco. each sample was spiked with surrogate compound (2,4,6-trichlorobiphenyls - IUPAC number 30) [76] prior to extraction. the extract then underwent liquid chromatography on a column containing Florisil. this further purified the apolar phase of lipids that could not be saponified, including steroids like cholesterol. total PCBs were quantified as the sum of all congeners. these congeners constituted 80% of the peak area of PCBs in the samples. the results were expressed in ng/g lipidic weight (ng/g lwt) f. hydrophilic (paralytic shellfish poisoning, domoic acid and brevetoxins) biotoxins were assessed by high performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) analysis in livers of whales no. 5, 6 and 7 and in the brainstem of no. 6 according to the procedures detailed the EU legislation regulating the detection of marine toxins in seafood. blubber, liver and muscle (about 2g) were lyophilized in an Edwards freeze drier for 2 days. samples were concentrated to 1 ml in acetonitrile. initial gradient was 60% acetonitrile and increased to 100% over 20min. whatman\u00ae cellulose thimbles (i.d. 25 mm, e.d. 27 mm, length 100 mm) to be used for extraction were preheated for about 30 min to 110\u00b0C. each sample was spiked with surrogate compound (2,4,6-trichlorobiphenyls - IUPAC number 30) [76] prior to extraction. this further purified the apolar phase of lipids that could not be saponified, including op\u2032- and pp\u2032- isomers of DDT and its derivatives DDD and DDE were calculated in all samples. total PCBs were quantified as the sum of all congeners. these congeners constituted 80% of the total peak area of PCBs in the samples. a multidisciplinary and wide range investigation was performed to assess any possible causes reported as temporally and spatially associated to mass strandings of sperm whales. weather and marine data were obtained from different national and international meteorological archives. previous surveys reported solar activity and lunar cycles among those natural factors potentially causing and/or influencing sperm whale mass stranding events. www.mammiferimarini.unipv.it/"}
