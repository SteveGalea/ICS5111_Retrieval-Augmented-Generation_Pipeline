{"summary": "influenza A virus infections remain a global problem, with only partially effective vaccines and therapeutics available for combating them. many aspects of influenza A virus infection at both the cellular and organismal level remain unclear. in this review, we will focus on the process of host shutoff, the global reduction of host gene expression by influenza A virus. protein NS1 and PA-X, a protein that is generated through a non-canonical translational mechanism, was thus only discovered in 2012. the purpose of such varied mechanisms of host shutoff in viral replication and immune evasion, their strain and species specificity, and how these mechanisms interact with each other are all questions that are under active investigation. a classical modality of host shutoff is the widespread degradation of host mRNAs. the most well known viral factors that mediate this type of host shutoff are vhs from herpes simplex viruses [6], and the SOX protein from Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [7]. early studies showed that influenza A virus also uses this modality of host shutoff. a separate collinear protein encoded from the same genome segment as PA was responsible for host RNA destabilization. in 2012, jagger et al. reported the surprising finding that a separate collinear protein encoded from the same genome segment as PA, which they termed PA-X, was responsible for host RNA destabilization. the ribosome stalls at a specific decanucleotide sequence in the PA mRNA. two main variants of PA-X exist: a more common 252-amino acid (aa) variant (191-aa N-terminal RNase domain and 61-aa C terminus) and a 232-aa variant (191-aa N terminal RNase domain and 41-aa C terminus) mainly found in swine and canine strains and in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain. the activity of host exonucleases appears to be required to complete RNA degradation after PA-X has fragmented RNAs. vhs associates with target RNAs via translation initiation factors. however, there are unique key aspects of the activity of PA-X. -X interacts with cellular proteins involved in RNA transcription. other RNases access targets based on translation. mRNAs and genomic vRNAs are automatically spared from PA-X activity. the role of the unique X-ORF in host shutoff is less clear-cut. cations impair host shutoff (Table 1) [19,29]. fusing the RNase domain of PA-X from Cal pH1N1 to a classical SV40 nuclear localization signal only partially restores host shutoff activity. Bavagnoli et al. showed that in vitro WSN PA and PA-X have greater RNase activity than the WSN PA/PA-X N-terminus alone, but did not distinguish whether this is due to increased RNA binding. one possibility is that the X-ORF is responsible for interactions between PA-X and cellular cofactors that guide its association with RNA. ation to A or E prevents nuclear import and activity (WSN, Cal, PR8) [19,22,29] [18,23] 204 N S 221 R Q 229 L S 57 R Q Amino acid differences responsible for higher shutoff activity of pH1N1 vs. WSN [18] 62 I V 65 S L 4 F na Important for PA-X shutoff activity. shorter 252-aa equine PA-X isoforms have slightly higher host shutoff activity in reporter assays than shorter 232-aa canine isoforms. however, the converse experiment elongating the X-ORF of the canine PA-X did not only increase PA-X activity unless additional mutations were also introduced. expressing the C-terminal 20 amino acids of the longer PA-X isoform alone could decrease gene expression. the 252-aa WSN PA-X has lower host shutoff activity than 232-aa Cal PA-X [18] Xu et al. highlighted how the X-ORF has become truncated over time in swine influenza isolates. the 41-aa variant is better at supporting viral replication and transmission in pigs and swine cells. the influenza RdRp acts on nascent RNAs [38] rather than fully processed ones like Bunyaviruses. the interaction between the Pol II and the RdRp has consequences for pol II activity. the association inhibits elongation by Pol II, which reduces the amount of cellular RNA transcribed. mNET-seq showed that cells infected with influenza A strains display signs of transcriptional dysregulation. transcription termination defect was still seen in cells infected with NS1-deficient Udorn or WSN [42] pol II degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. a reduction in host transcription occurs at the same time as Pol II degradation. degradation is secondary to reduced loading. the principal function of NS1 is to reduce activation of early type I IFN-mediated responses to infection. NS1 shutoff is accomplished through the inhibition of host mRNA 3\u2032 end processing. this inhibition is accomplished through interactions between the effector domain of NS1 and one of the components of the cellular cleavage and polyadenylation factor complex, CPSF30. NS1 variants with phenylalanine at aa 103 and methionine at aa 106 bind CPSF30 efficiently. NS1 variants with other amino acids at these positions do not bind CPSF30. a single amino acid change at position 186 is responsible for the lack of CPSF30 binding in the canine H3N8 NS1 [66] specific residues that affect the host shutoff activity of NS1 refer to naturally occurring variants with strong/weak CPSF30 binding. \u201cna\u201d in \u201cweak activity\u201d column is indicative of residues that were identified as important for host shutoff based on loss of activity. 3N2 strains reduce CPSF30 binding and host shutoff activity in 1918 H1N1 NS1 [69,70] 180 V A 96 E na Mutation causes temperature sensitive mRNA cleavage phenotype. transfection of CPSF30-binding NS1 variants down-regulates expression of unrelated co-transfected reporters. tail targeted high-throughput sequencing methods would interrogate changes in polyadenylation and isolate the effect of NS1 from those of other host shutoff factors. NS1 can also directly interact with several components of type I IFN signaling (reviewed in [51]) and inhibit the inflammasome [76,77]. poliovirus protease cleavage of translation initiation factors is dispensable for poliovirus translation. a similar type of shutoff may occur during influenza infection, and there is selective translation of mRNAs bearing the 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of influenza A virus mRNAs during infection. influenza NS1 proteins from WSN, A/Victoria/3/1975 H3N2 and PR8 have been proposed to promote selective translation of viral mRNAs. the translational effect of NS1 could be mediated through interactions with eIF4GI and the cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein. however, viruses lacking NS1 can replicate in cells that do not induce type I IFN like Vero cells [49]. viral factors that mediate this type of host shutoff are vhs from herpes simplex viruses [6], and the SOX protein from Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma-associated herpesvirus [7]. early studies showed that influenza A virus also uses this modality of host shutoff because the degradation of host RNAs is accelerated in influenza A virus-infected cells. cap snatching refers to the cleavage of host RNA polymerase II (Pol d PA-X was responsible for host RNA destabilization [12,13]. the ribosome stalls at a specific decanucleotide sequence in the PA mRNA. this stall results in a shift in the codon reading frame, thus generating the X-ORF [13]. a more common 252-amino acid (aa) variant (191-aa N-terminal RNase domain and 61-aa C terminus) and a 232-aa variant (191-aa N terminal RNase domain and 41-aa C terminus) mainly found in swine and canine strains and in the 2009 pandemic H1N1 strain. RNA degrading activity of PA-X results in relocalization of cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein to the nucleus and reduction in stress granule formation. vhs associates with target RNAs via translation initiation factors. however, there are unique key aspects of the activity of PA-X. removing the X-ORF abolishes the activity of PA-X in cell-based assays in various strains, including PR8, A/WSN/1933 H1N1 (henceforth WSN) and Cal pH1N1 [19,22,29]. this result suggests that shorter X-ORFs are non-functional. 1N1 viruses carrying a truncated PA-X with a 16-aa X-ORF caused an intermediate phenotype in terms of immune activation. this suggests that there is an evolutionary pressure to retain a full-length X-ORF. the X-ORF functions as a non-canonical nuclear localization signal. Bavagnoli et al. showed that in vitro WSN PA and PA-X have greater RNase activity than the WSN PA/PA-X N-terminus alone. but did not distinguish whether this is due to increased RNA binding, better protein stability or changes in enzymatic activity. the X-ORF is responsible for interactions between PA-X and cellular cofactors that guide its association with RNA. 204 N S 221 R Q 229 L S 57 R Q Amino acid differences responsible for higher shutoff activity of pH1N1 vs. WSN [18,23] 62 I V 65 S L 4 F na Important for PA-X shutoff activity presumably by allowing nuclear import (WSN) the longer 252-aa equine PA-X isoforms have slightly higher host shutoff activity in reporter assays than the shorter 232-aa canine isoforms. the shorter 252-aa equine PA-X isoforms have slightly higher host shutoff activity in reporter assays than the shorter 232-aa canine isoforms. Xu et al. highlighted how the X-ORF has become truncated over time in swine influenza isolates. the 41-aa variant is better at supporting viral replication and transmission in pigs and swine cells. many aspects of its biology and mechanism of action remain unknown. the interaction between the Pol II and the RdRp has consequences for pol II activity. the association inhibits elongation by Pol II, which reduces the amount of cellular RNA transcribed. the heptapeptide phosphorylation follows a stereotypical pattern during transcription. transcription termination defect was still seen in cells infected with NS1-deficient Udorn or WSN [42]. transcription termination defect is triggered by degradation of uncapped fragments of RNAs by Xrn2 and subsequent interactions between Xrn2 and Pol II [44]. pol II degradation is mediated by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. a reduction in host transcription occurs at the same time as Pol II degradation. degradation of Pol II starts several hours after infection. NS1 shutoff has no effect on viral mRNAs, because their poly(A) tails are generated via the stuttering of the RdRp rather than through cleavage and polyadenylation of the RNAs. NS1 shutoff has no effect on the viral mRNAs, because their tails are generated via the stuttering of the RdRp. mutating residues 103 and 106 can turn a non-CPS30 binding NS1 into a CPSF30-binding variant [54,64,65] there are some exceptions, as there are a few NS1s that do not bind CPSF30 despite having F103/M106. NS1s from the original pH1N1 strains and circulating canine H3N8 strains. \u201cna\u201d in \u201cweak activity\u201d column is indicative of residues that were identified as important for host shutoff based on loss of activity when the residue is experimentally mutated. residues identified as important for host shutoff based on loss of activity when the residue is experimentally mutated. NS1-mediated polyadenylation block can reduce expression of type I interferons. transfection of CPSF30-binding NS1 variants down-regulates expression of unrelated co-transfected reporters [52,53,54,55,56,57] NS1 interacts with the nuclear poly(A) binding protein PABPN (or PABII) [78]. this interaction reduces the elongation of the poly(A) tail beyond 10 residues, a process that requires PABPN stimulation of the poly(A) polymerase [78] early studies suggest that a similar type of shutoff may occur during influenza infection. a reporter fused to the 5\u2032 UTR of segment 5 (NP segment) from the WSN strain is translated in WSN-infected strains, while a reporter with a control 5\u2032 UTR is not. this finding is consistent with previous observations that eIF4E activity is reduced in WSN-infected cells. influenza NS1 proteins from WSN, A/Victoria/3/1975 H3N2 and PR8 have been proposed to promote selective translation of viral mRNAs. the translational effect of NS1 could be mediated through interactions with eIF4GI and the cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein. however, viruses lacking NS1 can replicate in cells that do not induce type I IFN like Vero cells [49]. the induction of innate immune chemokines and cytokines would block the initial cell-intrinsic protective responses, as well as the recruitment of circulating immune cells like macrophages, neutrophils, B and T cells. however, mutations in the PA and PB2 residues that allow RdRp to trigger Pol II degradation affect the virulence of influenza A strains. NS1 blocks type I IFN signaling at downstream steps by interactions with double-stranded RNA. this prevents the activation of two anti-viral ISGs, protein kinase R (PKR) and 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligo A synthetase (OAS) the CPSF30 binding capability of NS1 in isolation vs. in the context of the native virus may differ. mutations in the CPSF30 interaction site (aa 184\u2013188, Table 2) reduce the ability of the Udorn strain to replicate in MDCK cells. adaptation to humans may select for CPSF30 binding. CPSF30 binding promotes viral replication in cells and/or animal models. this is likely due to improved control of the production of innate immune and inflammatory cytokines. however, restoration of CPSF30-binding via targeted mutations reduces morbidity and mortality in mice. NS1 from equine H3N8 strains have acquired mutations that abolish host shutoff activity (i.e. CPSF30 binding) the strain-specific discrepancies likely arise from a combination of factors, including the biology of the host and the level of cytokines. phenotype of 1918 PA(fs) viruses is paradoxical. phenotype of 1918 PA(fs) viruses is paradoxical. mutations in frameshifting site increase host responses to infection. there are discrepancies in the literature when it comes to the overall effect of PA-X in morbidity and mortality during infection. some studies have reported no change in titer, increased immune activation and increased mortality [12], others have reported higher titers, increased immune activation and increased mortality [20,102,103,105], and yet others have reduced titers, increased immune activation and reduced mortality [21,106]. studies purportedly using very similar strains have obtained opposite results. there is currently no evidence for substantial differences in molecular function among PA-X variants that could give rise to different effects on virulence. a potential role of the X-ORF truncation could be adaptation to particular species. Xu et al. suggested shorter isoforms support better viral replication and immune evasion in swine cells and pigs. mutating the frameshifting site reduced plaque size and accumulation of a subset of viral proteins, without alterations in viral mRNA levels. mutations in PA-X do not generally reduce viral titers in MDCK cells [12,20], and in some cases promote replication in the human epithelial A549 cells and in mouse lung tissue [20,105]. the unprotected 5\u2032 ends of cellular Pol II transcripts generated by cap snatching could be the trigger for removal of Pol II from the body of genes. at least for NS1 and PA-X, the host shutoff is a deliberate effect of the proteins, with important immunomodulatory functions in context of in vivo infections. host shutoff also reduces the induction of innate immune chemokines and cytokines. NS1 (Section 2.3) is a well-known blocker of type I IFN induction. this block is not solely due to interactions with CPSF30 and inhibition of mRNA processing. NS1 blocks type I IFN signaling at downstream steps by interactions with double-stranded RNA. many avian isolates of H6, H9 serotypes also have residues at NS1 aa 103 and 106 that suggest their NS1 cannot bind CPSF30 and interfere with polyadenylation. CPSF30 binding capability of NS1 in isolation vs. in the context of the native virus may differ; other viral proteins may facilitate NS1-CPSF30 binding. between 1997 and 2004, these residues changed in H5N1 isolates. NS1 from current circulating pH1N1 strains has accumulated six mutations. this NS1 isoform is more efficient at reducing gene expression in reporter assays. NS1 variant from circulating pH1N1 strains was more effective in dampening induction of cytokines, like IFN, TNF, and CXCL10, and of ISGs like IFIT2 [68]. however, this increased ability to modulate host responses did not cause changes in viral titers in cell culture or mouse lung tissue [68]. in vivo studies with the PA(fs) viruses have provided extensive evidence that PA-X down-regulates innate immune and pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection. this role in innate immune evasion was shown with 1918 H1N1, pH1N1 and H5N1 strains, in which reduced PA-X expression resulted in increased induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines. 1918 H1N1 influenza strain garnered attention in part because the phenotype of 1918 PA(fs) viruses is paradoxical [12]. mutations in the frameshifting site increase host responses to infection. but they do not compromise the ability of viruses to replicate in vivo. the phenotype of PA-X mutant strains is influenced by other characteristics of the strain background. in strains that already induce strong immune activation losing PA-X may increase the inflammation to pathological levels. in strains that induce poor innate immune responses the increase may boost clearance. this explanation would not resolve all the conundrums in the field. the truncation to a 41-aa X-ORF appeared independently in two influenza A subtypes that infect dogs, suggesting this change may be of functional significance. a potential role of the X-ORF truncation could be adaptation to particular species. a corollary of this model is that it could \u201cerase\u201d the natural host gene regulation of the cell to allow for the selective expression of genes that are beneficial for viral replication. this model, however, is very hard to prove, and has only been clearly described in the herpesviral vhs host shutoff [108] rase activity may be a result of lack of frameshifting, which could change the stability and translation of the PA mRNA. a third possibility is that some of the decrease in host gene expression is an accidental consequence of viral processes. this idea was the basis for the original model of RNA destabilization as a by-product of cap snatching. influenza A virus may need a wide range of mechanisms to overcome host responses. this may arise from different host biology, so that one mechanism may not prove as efficient in one species as it is in another. NS1 and PA-X may not work at all in some species without prior adaptation. a cold-adapted vaccine with both active PA-X and CPSF30-binding NS1 is attenuated relative to the viruses with only one active host shutoff protein. this may prevent optimal viral replication, as it may reduce the expression of host proteins needed for viral replication or cause cell death. more work is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms of host shutoff in influenza A virus infection and its role in virulence and pathogenesis."}
