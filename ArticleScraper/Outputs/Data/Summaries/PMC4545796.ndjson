{"summary": "HFMD is an infectious disease that usually affects infants and young children under 5 years of age worldwide. the clinical manifestations are ulcerations in the oral cavity, buccal mucosa (enanthema) and tongue with peripherally distributed cutaneous lesions and vesicular rash (exanthema) other parts of the limbs including knees, elbows and buttocks may also be affected. HFMD in tropical climate countries, such as Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, typically showed years-round activity with no discrete epidemic periods. peaks during the rainy and winter seasons were also detected depending on season, year, and geographic regions. HFMD has shown an upward trend in the last five to six years. metagenomic has become an important strategy for virus discovery in human and animal diseases [28\u201330]. this technique circumvents some of the limitations of virus isolation, serology, and the amplification of only known conserved genomic regions [31]. 140 l of fecal supernatant from 29 HFMD patient samples were mixed into three pools, designated as HFMD-lib01 (10 samples), HFMD-lib02 (10 samples), and HFMD-lib03 (9 samples). the pooled supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-m membrane (Millipore, MA, USA) to remove eukaryotic- and bacterial-cell-sized particle and to enrich for viral contents. 1,244 Saffold virus 788 Bocaparvovirus 1,291 Coxsackie virus A10 433 Astrovirus 10 Coxsackie virus A16 17 Calicivirus 7 Enterovirus 71 3 Reovirus 30 HFMD-lib02 Picornaviruses 1,784 Rhinovirus C 1,772 Calicivirus 11 Coxsackie virus A8 6 Adenovirus 3 Saffold virus 4 Coxsackie virus A21 1,334 Astrovirus 1, the assembled contigs and singlet sequences longer than 100 bp were queried against non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases. sequences were classified according to their closest BLAST match if they were found to have 80% sequence coverage with a stringent e-value 1E-5. potential recombination event was considered if the subsequent event from two or more analyses were found with statistically significant support. the detection of rhinovirus was performed using a primer targeting 5\u2032UTR through the VP2 gene as previous described [38]. phylogenetic analysis To evaluate the genetic relationship between the virus-related sequences within the same species and/or family, phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method. bootstrap resampling with 1,000 replicates and bootstrap value of 70% was used as the cut-off. 140 l of fecal supernatant from 29 HFMD patient samples were mixed into three pools, designated as HFMD-lib01 (10 samples), HFMD-lib02 (10 samples), and HFMD-lib03 (9 samples). the pooled supernatants were filtered through a 0.45-m membrane (Millipore, MA, USA) to remove eukaryotic- and bacterial-cell-sized particle and to enrich for viral contents. Virus Read List of Virus Read HFMD-lib01 Picornaviruses 1,244 Saffold virus 788 Bocaparvovirus 1,291 Coxsackie virus A10 433 Astrovirus 10 Coxsackie virus A16 17 Calicivirus 7 Enterovirus 71 3 Adenovirus 9 Enterovirus 68 3 Reovirus 30 HFMD-lib02 Picornaviruses 1,784 Rhinovirus C 1,772 Calicivirus 11 Cox sequences longer than 100 bp were queried against non-redundant nucleotide and protein databases. sequences were classified according to their closest BLAST match if they were found to have 80% sequence coverage with a stringent e-value 1E-5. potential recombination event was considered if subsequent event from two or more analyses were found with statistically significant support (P-values 1E-5) enteroviruses were detected using concensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers specific towards the VP1 gene according to a previously described amplification protocol. the detection of rhinovirus was performed using the primer targeting 5\u2032UTR through the VP2 gene as previous described [38]. the sequences could be classified into nine viral families and 12 species including six families of RNA viruses: Picornaviridae, Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Paramyxiviridae, Reoviridae, and Picobirnaviridae. the family Picornaviridae consists of 29 ICTV-approved genera. enterovirus consists of nine enterovirus species (designated species A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, and J) and 3 rhinovirus species. only enterovirus species A to D and rhinovirus are human viruses. EV-like sequences could be characterized abundantly in the pooled clinical samples. phylogenetic analysis showed that EV68-lib01clustered with the previous reported strain identified from many countries worldwide with more than 92% nucleotide identity. the numbers of reads when the nucleotide sequence alignment showed e-value 1E-5 were indicated. HFMD-lib02 (HRV-lib02) accounting for 45.2% of the enterovirus reads. sequences of human rhinovirus, saffold virus, bocavirus, and astrovirus displayed at least 96% nucleotide identity to the respiratory tract-derived HRV isolate. phylogenetic analyses of the viral capsid genes VP4/VP2 and VP1 and 5\u2032UTR suggest that the HRV-related sequence strain formed a unique branch with HRV-Cc subspecies. the recombination analysis of these HRV-related sequences showed no evidence of recombination. two contigs (5,405 nt and 524 nt) and a singlet (176 nt) were recovered from a sample pool. these sequences spanned approximately 75% of the entire genome. BLAST searches of full-length sequences suggest these samples contained a genotype similar to the strain JPN404 from Japan. the SAFV-like sequence shared 93.8% nucleotide identity to SAFV3 in the P1 region (p 0.05) these similarity patterns were also observed for the strain JPN404. HAstV-like sequence fragments identified from HFMD-lib01 pool covered approximately 18% of the genome. HBoV belongs to the genus Bocavirus (subfamily Parvovirinae, family Parvoviridae) and can be classified into 4 genotypes designated as HBoV1 to HBoV4 by the structural VP1 sequence-based phylogenetic tree. HBoV1 and HBoV3 have been re-categorized into the group of bocaparvovirus 1. HBoV2 and HBoV4 are members of bocaparvovirus 2. sequences could be assembled into single long contig covering 5\u2032UTR to partial 3\u2032UTR (5,271 nt) with 99% nucleotide sequence identity. sequence reads consisting of 98.5% (710/721) and 1.5% (11/721) of SaV-related and NoV-related reads were found in the pool HFMD-lib01 (7 reads) and HFMD-lib03 (703 reads) nucleotide identity to the known strains of SaV varied between 94% to 99% for alignments covering between 114 nt to 1,032 nt. human rotavirus group A human rotaviruses (RVA) are contagious viruses responsible for acute gastroenteritis and severe watery diarrhea. they are found at high prevalence in infants, young children and immunocompromised individuals. study of enteric virus infections in infants showed that HPBV was one of the most common viruses frequently detected over a period of time. the sequence we recovered was relatively distant from previously reported HPBV sequences, and its classification was unclear. accumulating evidence suggests that BKV can also be detected in the stool samples of hospitalized children and from gastroenteritis patients as well as healthy adults. HFMD-lib01, HFMD-lib02, and HFMD-lib03 tested each sample for the type-specific enterovirus identified from the most frequent virus reads found in each pool. s constituted the majority of the virome sequences, accounting for 55.5% (4,706/8,482) of the HFMD eukaryotic viral sequences. most picornavirus sequences in the HFMD pools were from the genus Enterovirus [83.2% (3,914/4,706)], including enterovirus and rhinovirus species. three nucleotide sequences from the lib01 pool were assigned to EV species D type 68 VP1 gene. phylogenetic analysis showed that EV68-lib01clustered with the previous reported strain identified from many countries worldwide with more than 92% nucleotide identity. a total of 1,772 HRV-like sequences were recovered from HFMD-lib02 (HRV-lib02), accounting for 45.2% of the enterovirus reads. these sequences could be assembled into one long contig spanning 6,892 nucleotides (nt) representing 96% of the HRV genome (KP242035) 99% Virus type or strain was assigned based on the BLAST analysis. nt, nucleotide; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase Recombination is known to occur frequently among picornaviruses. some HRV-C strains appear to originate from recombination between the ancestors of HRV-A and HRV-C in 5\u2032UTR. SAFV replicates efficiently in the alimentary tract and is transmitted through oral-fecal route. infections by SAFV might also contribute to more severe symptoms in children such as HFMD-associated encephalitis, acute flaccid paralysis, myocarditis, and aseptic meningitis. a scan of the full reference set of completed and nearly completed genome sequences of eleven SAFV genotypes (41 sequences) and theilovirus-like members (13 sequences) using a suite of recombination detection program in RDP4. results showed that the SAFV-like sequence appeared to result from intertypic recombination between SAFV2 (major parent: EU681176) and SAFV3 (minor parent: EU681178) HAstV-like sequence fragments identified from HFMD-lib01 pool covered approximately 18% of the genome. HAstV-lib01 and HAstV-lib03 clustered within the new classified lineage of HAstV MLB1 and MLB2 respectively. HBoV belongs to the genus Bocavirus (subfamily Parvovirinae, family Parvoviridae) and can be classified into 4 genotypes designated as HBoV1 to HBoV4 by the structural VP1 sequence-based phylogenetic tree. HBoV plays a role in RTI and enteropathogenesis and may be associated with neurologic complications. the virome of the HFMD comprising viruses in the family Caliciviridae accounts for 8.5% (721/8,482) of the sequence reads consisting of 98.5% (710/721) and 1.5% (11/721) of SaV-related and NoV-related reads, respectively. nucleotide identity to the known strains of SaV varied between 94% to 99% for alignments covering between 114 nt to 1,032 nt. the amplified fragments were between 120 nt and 280 nt in length. they covered several parts of the genome including the U exon. all of the contigs and singleton reads were homologous to AdeV species C, commonly associated with RTI and gastroenteristis. the HFMD-lib03 pool contained 29 reads which could be assembled into 3 contigs (208 nt, 307 nt, and 531 nt) with 62%-77% amino acid identity to the RdRp gene of HPBV. the 2 singleton reads (121 nt and 163 nt) showed the best hit to the capsid protein genes of the different HPBV strains. BKV is a non-enveloped virus with a circle dsDNA genome that belongs to the Papovaviridae family. it can establish latent infection of the kidneys and causes neuropathy and nephropathy in immunosuppressed transplant patients. it has been suggested that the gastrointestinal tract is the latency site for BKV [76] picornaviruses are non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with single-stranded RNA segments (ssRNA) of positive polarity that typically range in size from 7 to 9 kb. most picornavirus sequences in the HFMD pools were from the genus Enterovirus [83.2% (3,914/4,706)], including enterovirus and rhinovirus species. the CV-A21 sequences identified in this study shared 80%-97% nucleotide identity to previous strains in the GenBank database. other EV species A related sequences included 24.1% CV-A10 (433), 0.9% CV-A16 (17), 0.3% CV-A8 (6), and 0.2% EV71 (3). a total of 1,772 HRV-like sequences were recovered from HFMD-lib02 (HRV-lib02), accounting for 45.2% of the enterovirus reads. these sequences displayed at least 96% nucleotide identity to the respiratory tract-derived HRV isolate LZY101 from China (JF317017) 2 5'UTR to RdRp 96% 96% SAFV-lib01 SAFV3 792 L protein, VP2 to 3C, 3C to 3'UTR 75% 98.6% HAstV-lib03 MLB2 1,479 Serine protease to RdRp, Capsid proteins 93% 99% HBoV-lib01 HBoV4 1,291 5\u2032UTR to partial 3\u2032UTR 99% Virus type human saffold viruses (SAFV) are members of the genus Cardiovirus, family Picornaviridae. first identified in 2007 from a child with febrile illness. SAFV replicates efficiently in the alimentary tract and is transmitted through oral-fecal route. the overall nucleotide identity in the partial polyproteins 1 (P1) and P2 regions to other SAFV genotypes were 66.3%-68.9% and 72.2%-90.6%, respectively. genome identity to SAFV3 were highest in VP2 (206 nt; 70%-99.5%) and lowest with VP1 (813 nt; 62%-99.2%). astrovirus-related sequences in HFMD-lib01 and HFMD-lib03 were the second most abundant viral reads in the HFMD virome. the relative ratio of HAstV-like sequences to the total number of virus reads was 35.9% in HFMD-lib03. HBoV belongs to the genus Bocavirus (subfamily Parvovirinae, family Parvoviridae) and can be classified into 4 genotypes designated as HBoV1 to HBoV4. HBoV-like sequences were found in the HFMD01 pool (HBoV-lib01), constituting 15.2% (1,291/8,482) of total virus reads in HFMD. nucleotide identity to the known strains of SaV varied between 94% to 99% for alignments covering between 114 nt to 1,032 nt. noV-like sequences shared at least 80% and 87% nucleotide identity to the known strains in ORF1 and ORF2 respectively. infection by HAdV is associated with a wide spectrum of clinical diseases including RTI, gastroenteritis, and keratoconjunctivitis. seven HAdV species, designated A to G, are formally recognized. the RVA-like strain were clustered within lineage 1 (G1-I1-C1-M1-A1-N1 genes constellations) with nucleotide sequence identity 98%-99% to the references in GenBank. the virus has been found in human feces as environmental contaminants as well as a pathogen in outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis and diarrhea. 2 contigs of 5 reads (195 nt and 257 nt) and 1 singlet (158 nt) were identified as BK polyomavirus (BKV) with approximately 99% nucleotide similarity to previous sequences. BKV can establish latent infection of the kidneys and causes neuropathy and nephropathy in immunosuppressed transplant patients. study characterized virome in fecal samples of pediatric HFMD patients during a 2012 widespread outbreak in Thailand. we used high-throughput next-generation sequencing to better understand the viruses present in HFMD patients who tested negative for enterovirus species A EV-71 and CV-A16/A6. a study in china cited a high incidence rate of CV-A21 infection in adults with RTI [82]. EV68 is unusual among EV in that it shares phenotypic properties of both enterovirus and rhinovirus. this virus was associated with RTI including pneumonia and bronchiolitis with greater severity in infant and school-aged children. these may reflect inactivated particles in swallowed respiratory secretions or actual replication in the digestive tract. the second most abundant viral sequences identified belonged to astroviruses. MLB1 was initially sequenced from the fecal samples of a child with diarrhea. a subgroup of adenovirus and enterovirus were isolated from three fatal cases [108]. it is conceivable that co-infection could precipitate or aggravate HFMD symptoms. future studies to examine viral profile in individual clinical samples are warranted. next generation sequencing to detect viruses from clinical specimens may be present below the limit of detection by conventional PCR assay. HFMD will require the study of larger populations, including epidemiologically matched healthy controls."}
