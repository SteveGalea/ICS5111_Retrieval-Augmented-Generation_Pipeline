{"summary": "the global health movement has the potential to reshape medical and health sciences, including research and education, as well as medical and public health practice. the concept of global health first appeared in the literature after world war II in the 1940s. the global health and innovation conference is recognized as the world\u2019s leading and largest global health conference. a better understanding of what drives the current global health movement could inform higher education decision-makers on how to better direct the development of medical and health sciences. a better understanding of what drives the global health movement could inform higher education decision-makers on how to better direct the development of medical and health sciences. significant differences can be observed in patterns of morbidity, mortality, life expectancy, and quality of life among people living in different countries across the globe. glaring inequities are compelling to philanthropists and segments of the industrialized world, resulting in substantial investment in global health. increasing awareness of health disparities fueled the drive of people in the less developed nations to improve their health conditions. awareness of differences in unevenly paced health development by the general public becomes a second driving force. rapid development in technologies for long distance commuting has greatly facilitated cross-country movement of persons across the globe. the global health movement has the potential to reshape medical and health sciences, including research and education, as well as medical and public health practice. the movement has the potential to reshape medical and health sciences, including research and education, as well as medical and public health practice. the 2013 Global Health Conference of CUGH held in washington, d.c. attracted more than 1,500 leaders, researchers, and innovators. a total of 314 grants were funded in the 2012-13 fiscal year alone. a better understanding of what drives the current global health movement could inform higher education decision-makers on how to better direct the development of medical and health sciences. a better understanding of the driving force for the global health movement may inform the governmental, non-governmental, and philanthropic organizations on how to better invest in health. the first factor is the rapid development of information technology in the past 1 to 2 decades, including the Internet, wireless technologies, and social media. the first factor is the influence of non-governmental organizations, particularly philanthropic organizations that are fueling the global health movement. global health movement will reshape our values on health and economic development. it will reshape the role of governmental and non-governmental organizations in dealing with medical and health issues. global health considers health of a locality, an individual, a group or a nation as an integral part of the whole globe. the ultimate purpose is to optimize resource allocation so that health disparities will be minimized. there is no consensus on the definition of global health to date. how to scientifically conceptualize global health remains a challenge to many theorists and other scientists interested in global health. the GHIC, initiated by Yale in 2011, has attracted more than 2,000 attendees every year. defining global health as a guiding principle will be ideal to promote global health development. this definition has the least boundary and the broadest inclusiveness. global health science can be defined as a new branch in medical and health sciences, and it will achieve its goal of health for all through global descriptive, etiological, and intervention research. global descriptive epidemiology is needed to depict, understand, and comprehend the global health status, including morbidity and mortality of all medical and health conditions and the corresponding socioeconomic and health care systems across the globe. global health intervention research will focus on optimization of health resources allocation to maximize intervention effect and minimize health inequalities across countries and regions in the globe. the establishment of the global health discipline is necessary for institutionalized education to recruit and train faculty and students. many schools in developed countries now offer graduate degree programs in global health. global health can first be considered a guiding principle. any effort to improve people\u2019s health, either locally or across national borders can be considered as global health. defining global health as a guiding principle will be ideal to promote global health development. this definition has the least boundary and the broadest inclusiveness. the door to global health will be widely open with this definition. evidence obtained through global etiological research is the foundation supporting the development of intervention strategies to deal with medical and health issues. global intervention strategies, including therapeutic, preventive, and promotion strategies, are to be developed, tested, and implemented to tackle any local health issues that will be of global significance if not appropriately managed. global health academic journals have been established, including Global Health Action, Global Public Health, and Global Health Promotion. a number of schools in industrialized countries started to establish global health institutions for research and education through collaboration with schools in low- and middle-income countries. medical and health status at the population level across the globe. such information may include but is not limited to health status, including morbidities, mortalities, life expectancies, major causes of diseases and deaths. such information would serve as the fundamental materials supporting the development of a global health perspective. global health teaching for etiological research should therefore emphasize systems science; 2) computer simulation; and 3) system modeling techniques. systems theory will guide us in our investigation of complex global medical and health issues, aided by a global perspective. training for global health intervention The ultimate goal of global health is to prevent and treat diseases and promote better health through global strategies. many international and global intervention programs developed by individual countries across the globe provide enriched experiences and data supporting the development of global intervention sciences. a number of programs for diffusion and dissemination of evidence based interventions are also models for global health interventions. medical and health education must first emphasize training to enhance global health perspectives. the approach to achieve this goal would be to provide adequate information regarding the medical and health status at the population level across the globe. such information may include but is not limited to: health status, morbidities, mortalities, life expectancies, major causes of diseases and deaths. global epidemiology must cover GIS technology - the most efficient method for global spatial and geographic mapping. teaching for global health etiology is to understand the etiology of medical and health conditions with a global perspective. natal Health, the Global School-Based Student Health Survey and the Global Youth Tobacco Survey have been used in empirical research to address global health issues. social media, including facebook, twitter, weChat, and QQ have been used in addressing large-scale significant issues in political sciences and economics [40,41]. training for cross-cultural competence has been addressed by all global health programs that have been established [5,30] inspired by programs for economic globalization, a number of related subjects are included in the global health training curricula."}
