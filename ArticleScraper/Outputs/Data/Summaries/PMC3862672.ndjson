{"summary": "vacuolating cytotoxin A (VacA) is one of the major toxins produced by H. pylori that may trigger molecular changes in gastric epithelial cells. VacA contains amino-terminal 33.4-kDa (p33) and carboxy-terminal 54.8-kDa (p55) domains. it is believed that p33 is responsible for the assembly of VacA into stable hexamers that form an VacA is also known to cause apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. it is now accepted that VacA targets mitochondria to mediate cell death. the unresolved question has been whether VacA induces cytochrome c release by directly targeting mitochondria. failure of the ER's capacity to resolve stress results in induction of the unfolded protein response (UPR) ER stress transducers in mammalian cells are PKR-like ER-localized eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2)- kinase (PERK), inositol-requiring enzyme 1(IRE-1) and Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). VacA-induced mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death stimulated by ammonia. ER stress and its downstream effectors during VacA-induced cell death remain to be defined. a human gastric cancer cell line was used in the study. globulin G (IgG) antibody column equilibrated with RX buffer. VacA was subsequently eluted with 50 mM glycine-HCl buffer (pH 1.0) VacA concentration was measured using a bead enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. amidine-2\u2032-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells with the characteristic nuclear changes of chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation were considered apoptotic. apoptosis was also confirmed biochemically by immunobloting for cleaved PARP. rabbit anti-Bim, rabbit anti-PERK (catalog # 3129S), rabbit anti-cleaved PARP (catalog # 5625S) and rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2- (catalog # 9721) antibodies were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA) on the following day, membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies. PERK targeting nucleotides were obtained from SIGMA and Ambion. the target sequences were (PERK siRNA: 5\u2032-CACAAACUGUAUAACGGUUUA-3\u2032), and (PERK siRNA #2: 5\u2032-GUGACGAAAUGGAAGA-3\u2032), respectively. mice were imaged by confocal microscopy with excitation and emission wavelengths of 488 and 507 nm. upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in Nagasaki University Hospital. patients were considered positive for H. pylori infection when all test results were negative. immunohistochemistry was performed with the streptavidin-biotin-peroxidase-complex method. sections were reacted for 20 min with 5% albumin. p values 0.05 were considered statistically significant. cells A human gastric cancer cell line was used in the study. VacA was precipitated from the culture supernatant with 50% saturated ammonium sulfate. VacA concentration was measured using a bead enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. to activate VacA, 0.2 v/v 300 mM HCl was added to VacA preparations. cells were treated with VacA in the presence of 5 mM NH4Cl. immunoblot analysis Whole cell lysates were directly lysed for 15 min. on ice using a commercially available cell lysis reagent from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL) nuclear extracts from whole cell lysates were resolved by 4\u201315% SDS-PAGE, transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membranes were incubated with appropriate horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Biosource International, Camarillo, CA) on the following day, membranes were incubated with chemiluminescent substrate (SuperSignal\u00ae West Pico Chemiluminescent, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL) for 5 min and was visualized with a chemiluminescent imaging system (FluorChem\u00ae FC2, Alpha Innote PERK targeting nucleotides were obtained from SIGMA and Ambion. the target sequences were (PERK siRNA: 5\u2032-CACAAACUGUAUAACGGUUUA-3\u2032), and (PERK siRNA #2: 5\u2032-GUGACGAAAUGGAAGA-3\u2032), respectively. upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed in Nagasaki University Hospital. endoscopies were performed for medically indicated reasons. written informed consent was obtained prior to enrollment. sections were washed in 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and incubated for 20 min with 10 mg/mL biotinylated antiserum. sections were then stained with 0.02% 3,3\u2032-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride. VacA induced a mild increase in the number of apoptotic cells. cell death was significantly enhanced when cells were incubated with NH4Cl. intoxication with VacA alone triggered weak expression of CHOP protein. expression of CHOP mRNA increased by 13 fold in cells treated with NH4Cl compared to untreated cells. XBP-1 mRNA existed in both spliced and un-spliced form in untreated cells. up-regulation of ATF-6 mRNA was also not observed following VacA treatment. VacA in the presence of NH4Cl is capable of inducing ER stress. VacA induces CHOP expression and phosphorylation of eIF2-. cells were treated with either vehicle (control), 5 mM NH4Cl, 120 nM VacA, or 5 mM NH4Cl plus 120 nM VacA for 8 hr. AZ-521 cells were transfected with siRNA targeted to CHOP. inhibition of transcriptional expression was assessed by real-time PCR. in response to treatment with both VacA alone and VacA plus NH4Cl, cells with knockdown of CHOP showed significant suppression of apoptosis. apoptosis was assessed by morphological changes after 30 min of DAPI staining. the data represent the mean SEM for n = 3 studies each performed in triplicate. PERK contributes to CHOP activation and cell death. cells were treated with either non-specific siRNA or PERK siRNA for 48 hr. data represent mean SEM for n = 3 studies. cells were treated with 5 mM NH4Cl plus 120 nM VacA for 24 hr. expression of Cleaved PARP was assessed by immunoblotting followed by densitometry. VacA induces expression of Bim via activation of ER stress. cells were treated with either vehicle (control), 5 mM NH4Cl, 120 nM VacA, or 5 mM NH4Cl plus 120 nM VacA for 8 hr. mRNA expression was assessed by real-time PCR. expression of Bim was assessed by immunoblotting followed by densitometry. differences between groups were compared by using an unpaired two-tailed t-test. expression of CHOP mRNA was unaltered in pylori-infected gastric mucosa. expression of BH3-only proteins in pylori-infected and uninfected human mucosa was compared. ER stress markers and BH3-only proteins are up-regulated in human mucosa. pylori-infected gastric mucosa (a lower GRP78 signal throughout the epithelium) original magnification was 40. mRNA was extracted from the biopsy specimen of H. pylori-negative and -positive gastric mucosa. difference between groups were compared by using an unpaired two-tailed t-test. intoxication with VacA alone triggered weak expression of CHOP protein. expression of mRNA was also increased by 13 fold in cells treated with VacA plus NH4Cl compared to untreated cells. eIF2-, which can cause transcriptional induction of CHOP downstream of ER-stress sensor PERK, was phosphorylated by incubation of cells with VacA plus NH4Cl. the data represent the mean SEM for 4 independent experiments. data was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni method. data was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni method. PERK-CHOP Pathway Regulates VacA- Induced Apoptosis in AZ-521 cells. PERK knockdown decreased apoptosis and production of cleaved PARP. PERK siRNA attenuated ER stress induced by VacA plus NH4Cl treatment. ER stress leads to PERK-mediated CHOP induction followed by mitochondrial dysfunction. the data represent the mean SEM for n = 3 studies each performed in triplicate. data was assessed by two-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni method. cells were treated with either vehicle (control), 5 mM NH4Cl, 120 nM VacA or 5 mM NH4Cl plus 120 nM VacA for 24 hr. differences between groups were compared by using an unpaired two-tailed t-test. VacA induces Bim expression in VacA-treated cells downstream of PERK. ER stress-mediated apoptosis can be executed via activation of BH3-only proteins. data was assessed by one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni method. p0.05, control vs NH4Cl plus VacA-treated cells. PCR was performed to assess Bim mRNA expression. the data represent the mean SEM for n = 3 studies. differences between groups were compared using an unpaired t-test. a group of ER stress markers and BH3-only proteins are elevated in human H. pylori-infected-gastric mucosa. mRNA was extracted from the biopsy specimen of H. pylori-negative and -positive gastric mucosa. VacA, one of the most important virulence factors of H. pylori, induces vacuolation and apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. ER stress is responsible for induction of pro-apoptotic BH3-only protein Bim. thapsigargin-induced apoptosis is attenuated in cultured guinea-pig gastric mucosal cells expressing a dominant-negative form of CHOP. VacA-mediated activation of CHOP, at least in part, contributes to apoptosis in gastric epithelial cells. some ER stress markers including ATF-6 up-regulation and enhanced XBP-1 splicing were not altered by VacA treatment. this suggests that VacA in combination with NH4Cl does not broadly activate ER stress signals but rather specifically enhances PERK-CHOP signaling pathways. however, gastric cells may try to adapt to a toxic environment by increasing the content of chaperone proteins including GRP78. ER stress-mediated signaling pathways are coupled to activation of several death signaling molecules, which promote mitochondrial dysfunction [25]. VacA was reported to reduce expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins that antagonize the activation of BH3-only proteins [49], and wei et al. have shown that BH3-only proteins are up-regulated in H. pylori-infected gastric epithelial cells.
