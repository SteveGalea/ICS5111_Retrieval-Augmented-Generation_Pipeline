{"summary": "in the u.s. there are more than 110 million ED visits per year. in the u.s. there are more than 110 million ED visits per year. the proportion of critically ill patients presenting to the ED has also risen. APACHE II score is one of the first physiologic scoring systems developed as a mortality prediction model. it predicts outcome accurately in a variety of medical illnesses, including pancreatitis [9], cirrhotic liver disease [10], infective endocarditis [11], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [13], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [13], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [13], chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [ APACHE II has been shown to be superior to the American Society of Anesthesiologists classification in preoperative prediction of postoperative mortality. other scoring systems such as the SAPS II [21], Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score [22], Multiple Organ Dysfunction score [23], Mortality Probability Models [24,25], and the Pediatric Risk of Mortality score [26,27] have been shown to be beneficial in predicting resource utilization, resource utilization, organ failure, and mortality in patients such as those with cardiovascular the three individual component scores of GCS have similar areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to that of the total GCS score for predicting ED intubation, neurosurgical intervention, brain injury, and mortality [40]. the therapeutic intervention Scoring System (TISS) evaluates the need in staffing, monitoring, and therapeutic intervention rather than stratifying severity of illness. physiologic scoring systems are applicable upon ICU admission and throughout the first 24 hours after ICU admission. authors used existing physiologic scoring systems to determine effectiveness of ground versus air transport for major trauma victims. study used three physiologic scoring systems to assess impact of ED intervention on morbidity and in-hospital mortality. the study reemphasizes the significant impact that ED intervention has on critically ill patients. existing scoring systems such as APACHE II either are limited to their original design or need to be recalibrated to include physiologic parameters in the ED [51] physiologic scoring systems developed and implemented in the emergency department setting ED scoring system Reference Objectives and method Summary results Application MEDS [61] Prospective cohort study in ED patients at risk for infection using multivariate analysis to identify independent predictors of death. the areas under the ROC curve were 0.82 for the derivation set (n = 2070) and 0.78 for the validation set (n = 1109) MEDS accurately identifies correlates of death in ED patients at risk for infection and predict their mortality MEES was found to be an efficient and effective method for determining the impact of ED intervention (n = 356) MEES is a reliable method for assessing prehospital intervention SARS. Previously developed SARS screening scores were examined in 239 patients with fever. a prediction model was developed based on independent multivariate predictors of death, including terminal illness, tachypnea or hypoxia, septic shock, platelet count below 150,000/mm3, band proportion above 5%, age above 65 years, lower respiratory infection, nursing home residence. the mortality in the study patients of 5.3% is exceedingly low compared with the more familiar sepsis mortality range (16\u201380%) emergency medicine score (REMS) is a modification of RAPS, with age and peripheral oxygen saturation added to the RAPS score. the area under the ROC curve is 0.85 for REMS, as compared with 0.65 for RAPS (P 0.05) a clinician can easily expand a REMS score into the full APACHE II score. pediatric risk of admission score includes nine physiologic variables, three medical history components, three chronic disease factors, two therapies, and four interaction terms. this score provides a probability of admission from the ED for pediatric patients. it was shown to be reliable in predicting admission and providing a measure of illness severity. physiologic scoring systems are typically developed to provide estimates of outcome for a group of patients, and not to predict individual patient outcome. most EDs are staffed for short-term stabilization of critically ill patients. physiologic scoring systems should not be used to make end-of-life decisions in emergency situations.
