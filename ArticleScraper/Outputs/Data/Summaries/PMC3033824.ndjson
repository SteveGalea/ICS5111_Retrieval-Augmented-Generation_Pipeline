{"summary": "contradictory results have been published concerning their surface expressed molecules and the T lymphocyte responses in mixed lymphocyte cultures. the use of either AECII cell line or fresh cells could explain the observed discrepancies. alveolar epithelial cells are being by far more numerous than macrophages. AECII are in contact with a huge amount of lymphocytes, the cells involved in the development of specific immune responses. the number of lymphocytes in the lung interstitium has been reported to be 1010. phenotypic analysis of human AECII compared the human tumor cell line A549 to freshly isolated human AECII. results were published in each paper focusing on a limited amount of phenotypic markers. AECII were isolated from macroscopically tumor free regions of lung tissues obtained following lobectomy or pneumectomy for lung cancer. cells reached confluence after 24 or 48 hours. purity averaged 85.78% (81.78% - 90.03%) for nine independent AECII isolations. gG anti-human DC-LAMP-PE (CD208) was used to identify AECII in the cell suspension as DC-LAMP is constitutively expressed by AECII [29,30] all reagents were obtained from BD Biosciences (Erembodegem, Belgium), except the antibody to DC-LAMP. non-labelled cells were plated in 48 wells flat-bottomed plates. cells were stimulated with human recombinant IFN- (100 ng/ml), human recombinant TNF- (50 ng/ml) or a combination of the two cytokines (IFN- 50 ng/ml and TNF- 25 ng/ml) value of P 0.05 was considered significant. all results were obtained with the GraphPad Prism version 4.00 for Windows. AECII isolation was adapted from a previously described technique. cells were stained with antibodies directed to surface molecules not expressed by AECII. anti-human CD19-FITC (clone 4G7, mouse IgG1 kappa), CD45-PerCp (clone 2D1, mouse IgG1 kappa), CD11b-APC (clone D12, mouse IgG2a kappa), CD14-APC (clone MphiP9, mouse IgG2b k Flow cytometric analysis was performed using a FACSCanto II (Becton Dickinson) and the FlowJo software. both the percentages of positive cells and the median of fluorescence intensity (MFI) were evaluated for each triplicate. seven and four independent experiments were performed in triplicate for A549 cell line and AECII respectively. the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test was applied to compare phenotypic markers expression of A549 versus AECII in resting conditions. study of fresh AECII showed almost no expression of CD80 (7.22%, 4.26% - 10.14%), a low expression of CD86 (28.93%, 11.74% - 44.13%) and of ICOS-L (4.82%, 8.32% - 16.76%) compared to fresh AECII in resting conditions. 49 cells (98.54%, 97.70% - 98.89%) and on a lower percentage of freshly isolated cells (58.99%, 52.07% - 73.23%) (P 0.01) the presence of alternative co-stimulatory molecules was highlighted for the two cell suspensions. the presence of alternative co-stimulatory molecules was highlighted. the phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry. the horizontal bars represent the medians of the results from seven independent experiments. the phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry. phenotypic differences were observed on freshly isolated AECII. the percentages of type II AEC expressing HLA-DR were not different after incubating the cells with IFN- and/or TNF- when compared to the resting cells. phenotypic markers density of fresh AECII by inflammatory cytokines. results were obtained from the same samples as those presented in Figure 4. relative medians of fluorescence intensity were analyzed. the study of the fresh AECII showed almost no expression of CD80 (7.22%, 4.26% - 10.14%), a low expression of CD86 (28.93%, 11.74% - 44.13%) and of ICOS-L (4.82%, 8.32% - 16.76%). these results indicate the constitutive surface expression of HLA-DR on freshly isolated AECII and the low expression of this molecule on the A549 cell line. the presence of alternative co-stimulatory molecules was highlighted for the two cell suspensions, as well as the very low or even absent expression of the B7 family molecules. the cells were incubated during 24 hrs with human recombinant IFN- and/or TNF- (in percentage) the phenotype was analyzed by flow cytometry. the horizontal bars represent the medians of the results from seven independent experiments. kines The effect of IFN- and/or TNF- on the expression of phenotypic markers were also evaluated on freshly isolated AECII. the percentages of type II AEC expressing HLA-DR or the different co-stimulatory molecules investigated here were not different after incubating the cells with IFN- and/or TNF-. phenotypic markers density of fresh AECII by inflammatory cytokines were obtained from the same samples as those presented in Figure 4. a value of P 0.05 was considered to be significant. freshly isolated AECII have a high constitutive surface expression of HLA-DR molecules. the expression of MHC-II molecules was even not modulated by IFN- and TNF-. this suggests further the potential of these cells to present antigens to CD4+ T lymphocytes. a lack of expression of CD80 (B7-1) and a low expression of CD86 (B7-2) both on the A549 cell line and on the freshly isolated AECII. only a slight increase in the densities of CD80 and CD86 and in the number of CD86 expressing cells on the A549 cell line was noted in the presence of IFN- and TNF-. alternative co-stimulatory signals have been reported allowing the stimulation in the absence of B7/CD28 interaction. both the A549 cell line and the freshly isolated AECII expressed CD54 and CD58 with a higher level of expression of CD54 and lower expression of CD58 on the AECII. authors' contributions VC made substantial contributions to the analysis and interpretation of the data, and wrote the manuscript.
