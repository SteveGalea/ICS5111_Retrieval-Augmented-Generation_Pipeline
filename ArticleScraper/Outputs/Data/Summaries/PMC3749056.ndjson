{"summary": "at least 32 % of amphibian species were categorized as threatened by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. two emerging pathogens, a chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) and a virus (ranavirus) have been implicated in this ecological crisis. ranaviruses are emerging pathogens, meaning amphibian populations have only recently been affected due to increased incidence, geography or host range. there is significant evidence for host switching of ranaviruses between vertebrate classes. host switching is thought to occur via a series of steps that involve geographical movement of viruses. ranavirus genomes have diverged in sequence and are known to have acquired several new genes that are not found in the broader family of the Iridoviridae. these new genes may have been acquired via the processes of horizontal gene transfer or recombination. the presence of several ranavirus genes without corresponding cellular homologues suggests that recombination is also a significant source of new genes. ranavirus genomes encode approximately 100\u2013140 putative gene products. genes that are involved in host-pathogen interactions exhibit episodes of intense positive selection during the process of establishing a new host species. absence of positive selection does not necessarily mean genes are not key factors in host range and immune evasion. dN/dS>1, dN/dS = 1 and dN/dS1 are inferred to reflect positive selection, neutral evolution and purifying selection respectively. the availability of several genomes of members of the family Iridoviridae provides the opportunity to assess the prevalence of positive selection within specific genes and across the ranavirus phylogeny. ten of these are ranaviruses, and represent viruses isolated from bony fish, salamander, frog and turtle species. these viral genomes vary somewhat in length and gene content. the genes examined in this analysis were identified previously as orthologues via a whole-genome comparative analysis. viral species/strain Genus Host species GenBank accession no.

Branches with incalculable dN/dS values >1 are shown in bold. if the ratio of N : S was greater than or equal to 4 : 0. Genes with an asterisk were also found to exhibit signatures of positive selection under site-based tests. median and mean dN/dS values for each gene group were compared. for each branch, we performed a Kruskal\u2013Wallis (K-W) test ( = 0.05) to compare the median dN/dS values for each gene group. on four of the 13 branches, significant differences were noted. the trend of higher mean and median values for the F/A/R gene group for three of the branches is consistent with the idea that F/A/R genes are involved in ranavirus host switching. the inset phylogenies show the significant branches in bold. boxplots for statistically significant branches are shown. these genes have been recently acquired and are unique to a single genus where host switching is evident. conservation of core genes may indicate that, in general, these genes are essential to the viral life cycle and that they are subject to purifying selection pressures. at least one codon with a posterior probability of >0.80 was identified for each gene. we then mapped the amino acid sites onto the secondary structure to determine whether any of the residues resided in areas of conformational flexibility. unstructured regions of proteins may be more tolerant to conformational and adaptive changes. the previous test for selection identified specific codons that had dN/dS>1. each gene was assigned a global dN/dS value along every branch of the tree. these included three genes from the RV and core gene groups. non-synonymous and synonymous (N : S) mutations predicted to have occurred along each branch (in parentheses) Branches with values of dN/dS>1 are shown in bold. if ratio of N : S was greater than or equal to 4 : 0. Genes indicated with an asterisk were also found to exhibit signatures of positive selection. genes from the F/A/R group (67 %) exhibit a relatively higher percentage of genes with elevated dN/dS values. results are consistent with selection in ranaviruses having been biased towards viral genes that are new to this clade. we also detected a significant difference in the medians for the TFV branch (P = 0.0381) using the K-W test. however, the ANOVA was not significant (P>0.05) higher dN/dS values for the ranavirus-specific gene groups along branches A and B could indicate selection acting prior to a potential host switch between amphibians and reptiles. this interpretation might also apply to the ATV branch. the phylogeny of viruses in the family Iridoviridae is consistent with extensive host switching by these viruses. the adaptation of a virus to a novel host species is often paired with intense episodes of positive selection acting on genes that increase the compatibility between the virus and host. we conducted a genome-wide scan for genes and lineages under positive selection to gain further insights into ranavirus host switching. genomes of members of the family Poxviridae and the order Herpesvirales have revealed the presence of virus-encoded homologues of cellular cytokines that have evolved to modulate the host immune response. the gene ORF26R (-subunit of eukaryotic initiation factor 2) is a virus-encoded cellular homologue (Eaton et al., 2007). a recent study of the adaptive evolution of influenza viruses showed that elevated adaptive evolution was associated with the establishment of avian influenza viruses in swine populations. this situation is unique from these other examples because the cross-species transmission of these viruses appears to have coincided with the addition of new genes to the viral genome. sequences for 75 ORFs from 15 complete vertebrate Iridoviridae genomes were downloaded from GenBank. these ORFs were placed into specific gene groups based on the genomic analysis of Eaton et al. (2007). genes from viral genomes not analysed by Eaton et al. were identified via blast searches and analyses conducted by the authors of the published genome sequences. codonTest was used to determine the best nucleotide substitution model for the remaining 71 alignments. a total of 25 ORFs with significant evidence of recombination were split based on the location of the recombination breakpoints. each component was tested individually in subsequent analyses. the resulting eight-taxon phylogenies were accepted based on the criteria of a fully resolved topology and bootstrap support values. a total of 25 ORFs that did not meet these requirements were excluded from the analyses. the remaining core (18), RV (11), F/A/R (six) and \u2018other\u2019 (11) ORFs were further analysed. model was run for each ORF under the f61 codon frequency models. sites that fell into positively selected classes were then subjected to a Bayes empirical Bayes analysis, which calculates a PP of a site fitting into a dN/dS>1 class. the null model was then compared with the alternative model. we compared both the median and mean dN/dS values for each group. branches with observed N : S ratios greater than 1 : 0 and less than 4 : 0.. sequences for 75 ORFs from 15 complete vertebrate Iridoviridae genomes were downloaded from GenBank (Table 1). these ORFs were placed into specific gene groups based on the genomic analysis of Eaton et al.

(2007) were identified via blast searches and analyses conducted by the authors of the published genome sequences. the first group, the core gene group, included 26 ORFs that have orthologues in all members of the family Iridovirdae (including the two invertebrate genera Iridovirus and Chlorididovirus) the third group, the RV gene group, included six ORFs that have orthologues only found in a total of 25 ORFs with significant evidence of recombination were split based on the location of the recombination breakpoints. phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for individual ORF alignments using the rapid bootstrap command in RAxML. resulting eight-taxon phylogenies were accepted based on the criteria of a fully resolved topology and bootstrap support values. a total of 25 ORFs that did not meet these requirements were excluded from the analyses. the remaining core (18), RV (11), F/A/R (six) and \u2018other\u2019 (11) ORFs were further analysed. sites that fell into positively selected classes were then subjected to a Bayes empirical Bayes analysis. the free-ratio model allows a unique dN/dS value to be calculated for each branch in the phylogeny. the dN/dS values of several branches were undefined due to zero observed synonymous changes along the branch (dN/0) branches with observed N : S ratios greater than 1 : 0 and less than 4 : 0 are not uninformative with respect to selection; they are likely to be evolving near neutral if N is small, and under positive selection if N is large. each test involves the comparison of a null model (M8a) with a model that incorporates positive selection (M8) sites that fell into positively selected classes were then subjected to a Bayes empirical Bayes analysis. the sites detected were reported as being under positive selection if they had a PP of >0.80. the dN/dS of the target branch was fixed at 1 and the likelihood was calculated. the null model was then compared with the alternative model, which fixed the target branch at the dN/dS value calculated under the free-ratio model. the positively selected sites identified by the NSsites methods were then mapped onto the predicted secondary structure of the protein."}
