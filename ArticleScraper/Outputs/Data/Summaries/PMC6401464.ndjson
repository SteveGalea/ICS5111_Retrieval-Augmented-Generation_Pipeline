{"summary": "norovirus is a nonenveloped single-stranded RNA virus within the Caliciviridae family. the genome contains three open reading frames (ORFs) where ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins, ORF2 encodes the major capsid protein (VP1) and ORF3 encodes the minor capsid protein (VP2) each human genogroup is further subdivided into numerous genotypes. studies have indicated that norovirus may interact with HBGAs prior to cell attachment (9) and/or bind particles on cell surfaces (10). human monoclonal antibodies targeting the GI.1 HBGA pocket inhibited norovirus VLPs from binding to HBGAs by steric interference with the HBGA pocket (11) in the current standard treatment guidelines for HIV infections, three synergistically acting drugs are used. these compounds are from different drug classes and target distinct stages of the virus life cycle to suppress virus proliferation (21\u201323) a combination of either Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2\u2032FL improved HBGA binding inhibition. RESULTS Nanobody binding interactions with the GI.1 P domain and GI.1 VLPs were confirmed using a direct enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the three GI Nanobodies bound to the P domain in a dose-dependent manner and with a comparable cutoff dilution. all three Nanobodies bound to 5 g/ml of GI.1 VLPs. the maximum OD490 signal was approximately 2-fold lower than those for Nano-62 and Nano-94. the cutoff levels were comparable, at 0.39 g/ml (Nano-7), 0.2 g/ml (Nano-62) and 0.2 g/ml (Nano-94) ITC was performed to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between GI.1 P domain and Nanobodies. all three Nanobodies exhibited nanomolar binding affinities (subnanomolar for Nano-7) and 1:1 stoichiometry. all binding reactions were characterized with an exothermic type of reaction. data collection Space group P21 C2 C2 Cell dimensions a, b, c 59.17, 140.90, 92.15 172.24, 89.64, 61.92 94.89, 111.06, 122.46,, (\u00b0 90, 91.81, 90 90, 107.80, 90 90, 99.81, 90 Resolution range () 47.53\u20131.58 (1.63\u20131.58) 46.67\u20132.09 (2.16 crystal structure of GI.1 P domain\u2013Nano-7 complex was solved to 1.58- resolution. nano-7 interacted with P1 and P2 subdomain residues as well as both P domain monomers. this finding was likely related to the subnanomolar affinity of Nano-7. the asymmetric unit contained one P domain dimer (gray) and two nano-7 molecules (green) nano-7 bound to the side of the P domain. the P domain hydrogen bond interactions included side-chain and main-chain interactions from both monomers. structure of GI.1 P domain\u2013Nano-62 complex was solved to 2.09- resolution. nano-62 bound on the side of the P domain and in the grove between two P domain monomers. compared to Nano-7, fewer direct hydrogen bonds were observed. direct hydrogen bonds were formed with P domain chain A-Nano-62, P464-G105 and D465-R52. chain B, Q449-R99, E313-G26, G278-R27, T280-R27, R275-Y115, D273-R101, and Q449-F102. all binding residues, except one (Asp102), were located on the P2 subdomain. the nano-94 binding pocket was in close proximity to the GI.1 HBGA pocket. nano-94 bound to the top of the P domain. the nanobody binding residues were all located in regions of the P domain. this finding corresponded well with the lack of nanobody cross-reactivity among other GI genotypes. this finding corresponded well with the lack of nanobody cross-reactivity among other GI genotypes. nano-62 and nano-94 blocked the binding of GI.1 VLPs to PGM in a dose-dependent manner, with IC50s of 0.43 g/ml and 9.23 g/ml, respectively. the experiments were performed in triplicate. nano-94 treatment caused particle aggregation compared to GI.1 VLPs alone (black) nano-7 (green) and Nano-62 (cyan) treatment did not affect the particle sizes. EM analysis of untreated and nanobody-treated VLPs. s were preincubated with nano-7 or nano-94 combined with a constant 2\u2032FL concentration (10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mM 2\u2032FL) the combination of Nano-7 or Nano-94 with 2\u2032FL led to enhanced inhibition, indicating that no adverse effects occur between Nanobodies and 2\u2032FL. the extent of inhibition enhancement correlated with increasing 2\u2032FL concentrations, suggesting a synergistic effect. each graph shows normalized inhibition of GI.1 binding to PGM through Nano-7 alone (green line), 2\u2032FL alone (dashed black line), or a combination of nano-7 and 2\u2032FL (blue line) for Nano-7, the observed inhibition of the combinations ranging from 100 to 1.6 g/ml Nano-7 combined with 10 to 50 mM 2\u2032FL closely matched the expected value for addition of the two single effects. each graph shows normalized inhibition of GI.1 binding to PGM by Nano-85 alone (pink line), 2\u2032FL alone (dashed black line), or a combination of Nano-85 and 2\u2032FL (blue line) the expected values for additivity according to the Bliss model (black line) were calculated for each graph. nanobody binding to GI.1 capsid was detected with serially diluted Nanobodies. Experiments were performed in triplicate and the cutoff was set at 0.15 (dashed line) all three Nanobodies were capable of detecting 10 g/ml of GI.1 P domain in a dose-dependent manner. the maximum OD490 signal was approximately 2-fold lower than those for Nano-62 and Nano-94. ITC was performed to evaluate the thermodynamic parameters of the interaction between GI.1 P domain and Nanobodies. all binding reactions were characterized with an exothermic type of reaction. the structure of Nanobodies in complex with the GI.1 P domain was determined using X-ray crystallography. the overall structure of the P domains in all Nanobody complex structures was reminiscent of the unbound P domain (12). the electron densities for all Nanobodies were well resolved and had the typical immunoglobulin fold. the binding sites of nano-62 were similarly located on the side of the P domain. the crystal structure of the GI.1 P domain\u2013Nano-7 complex was solved to 1.58- resolution. nano-7 interacted with P1 and P2 subdomain residues as well as both P domain monomers, which included both main and side chains. the nanobody clashed with the S domain as well as neighboring P domains. this result suggested that the neighboring P domains and/or the S domain would need to move in order for Nano-7 to bind to intact particles. asymmetric unit contained one P domain dimer (gray) and two nano-7 molecules (green) X-ray structure of GI.1 P domain and nano-7 complexes fitted into X-ray structure of the GI.1 VLP (PDB ID 1IHM) the VLPs are shaded light gray (P domain) and dark gray (S domain), while the GI.1 P domain and Nano-7 are colored blue and green respectively. several GII Nanobodies were shown to bind in occluded regions on the capsid (13, 20) however, in the case of the GII VLPs, the P domain was raised off the S domain. the asymmetric unit contained one P domain dimer and two Nano-62 molecules (cyan) nano-62 bound to the side of the P domain. the structure of GI.1 P domain\u2013Nano-94 complex was solved to 2.31- resolution. nano-94 bound on the top of the P domain and interacted with one P domain monomer. all binding residues, except one, were located on the P2 subdomain. hydrophobic interactions involved P domain chain A-Nano-94, P382-F107, H381-Y98, P379-W106, and I392-I105. the nanobody binding residues were all located in regions of the P domain, which included both conserved and variable residues. this finding corresponded well with the lack of nanobody cross-reactivity among other GI genotypes. GI.1 residues interacting with nano-7 (green), nano-64 (cyan) and nano-94 (orange) are colored accordingly. the asterisks mark conserved amino acids. the asterisks mark conserved amino acids. nano-62 showed weak inhibition, with a maximum inhibition of 15%. the experiments were performed in triplicate. VLP structural integrity upon Nanobody treatment. the untreated VLPs exhibited a single peak, indicating a homogenous sample with VLP diameter of 42 nm. incubation of GI.1 VLPs with Nano-94 dramatically increased the heterogeneity and led to a peak shift to 1,000 nm. a combination of GI Nanobody and 2\u2032FL inhibited GI.1 VLPs from binding to PGM, with an IC50 of 50 mM (12). a combination of Nanobody and 2\u2032FL led to enhanced inhibition, indicating that no adverse effects occur between Nanobodies and 2\u2032FL. the differences between expected additivity and the observed synergistic values were statistically significant (P 0.05) each graph shows normalized inhibition of GI.1 binding to PGM through Nano-7 alone (green line), 2\u2032FL alone (dashed black line), or a combination of nano-7 and 2\u2032FL (blue line) the combination of Nano-85 and 2.5, 5, and 10 mM 2\u2032FL inhibited the attachment of VLPs to PGM to a greater extent than with Nano-85 or 2\u2032FL alone, indicating a positive cooperative effect. for most combinations, the observed effects matched the expected additivity. only two human norovirus VLP structures have been determined at a resolution that can clearly distinguish the P and S domains. the major difference between the GI and GII VLP structures was how the P domains were resting on and raised (15 ) off the S domains. GI nanobodies nano-7 and nano-62 bound to occluded epitopes. nano-7 also showed efficient inhibition of VLP attachment to PGM. binding of nano-7 to lower region of the P domain induces a conformational change of the capsid. only minor rearrangements of the P domain loops were observed. the binding was characterized by positive enthalpy change. however, fitting of nanobody-P domain complexes in all possible positions on the GI.1 VLP structure revealed sterical clashes on the capsid. a nanobody and 2\u2032FL combination therapy may result in an increased inhibition of norovirus infection. a study showed that the oral administration of a rotavirus-specific-Nanobody was effective in treating rotavirus-induced diarrhea in an animal model. expression was induced with 0.7 mM isopropyl thio-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) for 18 h at 22\u00b0C. cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication on ice. the cleaved P domain protein was purified from a Ni column. nanobodies were subcloned into a pHEN6C expression vector. expression was induced with 1 mM IPTG at an OD600 of 0.9. nanobodies were eluted from a Ni column after washing steps. the reaction was stopped with 6% (vol/vol) HCl. a cutoff limit was set at OD490 of >0.15, which was 3 times the value of the PBS negative control (3, 47) crystals were grown in mother solution containing 0.17 M ammonium acetate, 0.085 M sodium citrate (pH 5.5) and 20% (wt/vol) polyethylene glycol 3000 (PEG-3000) prior to flash-freezing in liquid nitrogen, single crystals were transferred to a cryoprotectant with or without 30% ethylene glycol. the VLPs and Nanobodies (10 l/10 l) were incubated for 10 min at room temperature, diluted in 1 ml of distilled water, and then measured. the grids were washed 30 times with distilled water and stained with 1% uranyl acetate. 100 l of each VLP-Nanobody mixture was added to triplicate wells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated streptavidin monoclonal antibody was added to the wells and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the GII.10 VLPs were detected using polyclonal anti-GII.10 rabbit antibodies (1 h at room temperature) and polyclonal anti-rabbit-HRP conjugate (1 h at room temperature) Bliss independence was employed for data analysis of the HBGA-blocking assays. the GI.1 P domain was cloned into a modified expression vector. expression was induced with 0.7 mM isopropyl thio-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG) cells were harvested by centrifugation and disrupted by sonication on ice. sion no. AB078335, strain Funabashi258), GI.2 (GenBank accession no. L07418, strain Southampton), GI.3 (GenBank accession no. BD011871, strain Kashiwa645), GI.4 (GenBank accession no. AB042808, strain Chiba407), and GI.11 (GenBank accession no. AB058547, strain #8) were expressed in insect cells (45, 46) nanobodies were detected with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated monoclonal antibody against polyhistidine (Sigma) at a dilution of 1:4,000 in PBS. the reaction was stopped with 6% (vol/vol) HCl, and absorption at 490 nm (OD490) was measured. the GI.1 P domain was mixed separately at a 1:1.4 molar ratio with the nano-7, nano-62, and nano-94. each complex was purified by size-exclusion chromatography using a superdex-200 column and concentrated to 4.6 mg/ml. the complex structures were refined in multiple rounds of manual model building in Coot (50) and refined with Phenix (51) the PDBePISA server was used to determine binding interfaces and calculate the surface area. the binding interactions were analyzed using Accelrys Discovery Studio. the plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.4) containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS-T) and then blocked with 5% skimmed milk in PBS for 1.5 h at room temperature. after washing, 100 l of each VLP-Nanobody mixture was added to triplicate wells. all experiments with PGM binding were performed in triplicate. a similar approach was performed, except that the serial dilutions of Nano-7/Nano-94 were combined with constant concentrations of 2\u2032FL. in a similar assay, blocking of GII.10 attachment to PGM was examined. a comparison of the calculated expected additive effect to the observed results demonstrates how the drugs interact with each other. if the observed combination values are 20% above the expected additivity values, synergistic effects are implied, and antagonism is implied."}
