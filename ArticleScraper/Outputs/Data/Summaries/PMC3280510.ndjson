{"summary": "millions of people living in tropical and subtropical regions of the world are infected by DENV each year. the deNV complex consists of 4 distinct but related viruses designated as serotypes. people who have recovered from primary DENV infections develop robust antibody responses that cross react with the 4 serotypes. each virus particle has 180 monomers of E that are organized into 90 tightly packed dimers that lie flat on the surface of the viral membrane. each virus particle has 180 monomers of E that are organized into 90 tightly packed dimers that lie flat on the surface of the viral membrane. dengue virions are assembled on the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the virus buds into the lumen of the ER as immature virions. the surface of immature particles has a jagged appearance because prM and E proteins are initially assembled as trimeric spikes that protrude away from the envelope. mouse MAbs that bind to E protein react with more than one serotype of DENV. the lateral ridge epitope interacts with serotype-specific strongly neutralizing MAbs. the lateral ridge epitope interacts with serotype-specific strongly neutralizing MAbs. mouse antibodies have also been used to explore mechanisms of dengue neutralization. there are 180 potential binding sites on the virion for an antibody that binds to E protein. however, as indicated above all 180 molecules are unlikely to be bound by antibody because of steric effects and limited accessibility of some epitopes. flaviviruses are only neutralized after the number of antibodies bound to the virion exceeds a critical threshold. a lower affinity antibody may neutralize if many epitopes are accessible to binding. a lower affinity antibody may neutralize if many of the epitopes are accessible to binding. early studies on the durability of the immune response following deNV infection were conducted by Sabin (1952) the subjects were protected up to 18 months from re-infection with the same serotype. when challenged with a heterologous serotype, cross protection only lasted 2\u20133 months after the first infection. the rapid and elevated response is caused by the stimulation of memory B-cells from the primary infection. the first antibodies that appear following a secondary infection neutralize the serotype responsible for the primary infection better than the second virus. serum IgG titers are much higher in secondary compared to primary infections. in secondary dengue the IgM response is variable, and some cases undetectable. studies have been done with dengue immune sera and human MAbs. fusion loop antibodies are unlikely to be the target of serotype-specific, potently neutralizing antibody. EDIII epitopes are present at low levels in human immune sera and Crill and co-workers observed a correlation between levels of EDIII antibody and neutralization potency of immune serum samples. studies with dengue immune sera also indicate that only 5\u201335% of serum antibodies bind to the ectodomain of E expressed as a recombinant antigen. the majority of human MAbs produced have been weakly neutralizing and serotype cross reactive. hMabs are rare indicating that only small fraction of the total antibody response is responsible for virus neutralization. the structure of one of the antibodies (CR4354) bound to the west Nile virion showed that the antibody bound to a complex epitope that spanned EDI/II and EDIII from adjacent dimers. these antibodies appear to block infection by cross linking E proteins on the virion and blocking conformational changes required for viral entry. prM antibodies cross reacted with all 4 serotypes and their neutralization capacity ranged from poor to moderate at best. despite this genetic variability, it is widely assumed that neutralizing antibody epitopes are conserved among strains belonging to the same serotype. laboratory based studies show that intra-serotype variation can lead to large differences in antibody neutralization titer. in a study of pediatric dengue cases in Thailand, investigators observed significant differences in the ability of sera to neutralize reference and clinical strains of DENV3 [63]. antibodies can also harness cellular mechanisms such as phagocytosis and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity to control deNV infection. some studies have reported on a strong correlation between in vitro neutralization potency and in vivo protection both with monoclonal antibodies and polyclonal sera. a number of human flavivirus antibodies recognize epitopes preserved on the intact virion but not recombinant E protein is intriguing as such antibodies may be produced by the multivalent virus particle directly activating B-cells without any T-cell help [17,52,57]. deNV infection also inhibits type I interferon responses and suppresses antigen presentation by myeloid cells. this effect is likely to influence the quality of the adaptive immune response, including antibody production. ADE activity of pre-illness undiluted sera did not correlate with the severe disease severity or viral load following secondary infections. studies with non-human primates have demonstrated that animals treated with subneutralizing levels of antibody develop higher serum viremia compared to untreated animals. the disease was characterized by elevated level of cytokines (TNF, IL-6, and IL10), and thrombocytopenia, which is similar to severe DENV illness in humans. antibody can enhance viral replication and induce host cytokines responses that lead to clinical outcomes similar to DHF/DSS. antibody mediated infection leads to a suppression of the antiviral state within the infected cell and the release of a greater quantity of infectious virions by each infected cell compared to cells infected by antibody-independent entry. a recent study showed a quantitative difference in the ability of primary immune sera to enhance a homologous versus heterologous serotype. a heterologous serotype was enhanced at high serum concentrations. the actual target(s) of antibodies in human immune sera that enhance DENV infection have not been identified. the field will evolve rapidly as we learn more about the human B-cell response and we develop better animal models for dengue. the study characterizes human B-cell responses following primary and secondary dengue infection."}
