{"summary": "severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome is an emerging infectious disease with a high fatality rate of 12 to 30%. the disease was originally suspected to be human granulocytic anaplasmosis (59) but its causative agent, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, were not isolated from clinical samples. it was not until recently that a novel Bunyavirus genome was identified in most patient sera. NSs of RVFV is located in fibrillar structures in the nuclei of infected cells (53), but NSs of Uukuniemi virus is distributed throughout the cytoplasm (39). NSs of RVFV can target cellular TFIIH transcription factor (25), block interferon (IFN) production through various mechanisms (4, 41, 46), and contribute to viral pathogenesis. NSs can infect human monocytic THP-1 cells, in which the virus replicated efficiently but no cell death occurred. NSs and N proteins inhibited IFN signaling, but NF-B signaling facilitates SFTSV replication. the sequences of the viral L, M, and S segments have been deposited at GenBank, National Center for Biotechnology Information. the accession numbers are JQ317169, JQ317170, and JQ317171, respectively. plasmid containing full-length nucleotides of S gene was synthesized by PCR. NSs and N cDNA cloning and expression were synthesized by PCR. plasmid pRK5 was subcloned into plasmid pRK5 with flag or hemagglutinin tag. hek293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 105 cells per well. cells were transfected with pRK5 control plasmid or the plasmids expressing NSs or N, along with pGL3-IFN-Luc or pGL3-IFN-Luc or pRL8-SV40. hek293T cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 2.5 105 cyanine 3-CTP-labeled cRNA probes were generated from 1 g of total RNA following Agilent one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis. each microarray experiment was performed with technical duplicates for infected or uninfected control samples. cells were permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 on ice for 10 min, followed by three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were then incubated with an anti-SFTSV serum collected from a patient. the cells were then stained with 1 g of DAPI/ml at room temperature for 5 min. a two-tailed Student t test was used to evaluate the data by SPSS software (IBM SPSS, Armonk, NY) an 2 analysis was used to calculate significant differences of the data, with a probability of 0.05 considered a significant deviation. human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) cells were grown in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM; Gibco) with 8% serum and antibiotics. all viral aliquots were stored at 80\u00b0C. anti-pro-caspase-3, caspase-6, caspase-7, NF-B, TBK1, MAVS, MyD88, phosphor-p65, phospho-NF-B, and anti-IB- antibodies were purchased from cell signaling technology (Danvers, MA) the full length of the S segment cDNA of the SFTSV virus was synthesized by PCR. NSs and N were amplified by PCR procedures and subcloned into a plasmid pRK5 with either a flag or hemagglutinin tag for mammalian expression under a cytomegalovirus promoter. washes, BCIP (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolylphosphate)/nitroblue tetrazolium or enhanced chemiluminescence reagents (Invitrogen) were used for signal development. the -actin levels were detected as an input control. cells were incubated with the anti-Flag antibody at 4\u00b0C overnight. cyanine 3-CTP-labeled cRNA probes were generated from 1 g of total RNA following Agilent one-color microarray-based gene expression analysis. human 4x44K slides (Agilent) were used for hybridization and scanning with an Agilent scanner (G2565BA) each microarray experiment was performed with technical duplicates for infected or uninfected control samples. cells were incubated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG(H+L) at a 1:200 dilution at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and then stained with 1 g of DAPI/ml at room temperature for 5 min. cells were washed and resuspended in PBS, smeared on a glass slide. cytopathic effect was observed at 18 and 38 hpi. monocytes appeared to respond to the infection. THP-1 cells were mock infected or infected with the virus. the numbers of positive cells rose to 30 and 50% at 24 and 48 h, respectively, when the cells were infected with 0.1 multiplicity of infection (MOI) the culture media of the infected THP-1 cells were also used to inoculate Vero cells. the infection of Vero cells was used thereafter for infectious virus titration (TCID50) culture media of infected THP-1 cells were taken at 8, 18, and 28 hpi. total RNA were extracted from either control or infected THP-1 cells at 8, 18, and 28 hpi. no cleavage/activation of caspase-3 occurred in SFTSV-infected cells. lysates of infected cells were analyzed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 hpi for pro-caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels. the results showed that no cell death or apoptosis was induced by SFTSV infection in monocytes. antiviral host responses were mounted, but levels were moderate in monocytes. we also measured the transcripts of MDA-5, a member of RLR. involved in IFN responses and innate immunity. some inducible proteins have important roles in positive feedback of IFN responses. others, such as SOCS1, may provide a negative-feedback signal. adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) was moderately upregulated. TP was used to calculate relative fold changes of genes involved in IFN and NF-B responses. log ratios are depicted in red (upregulated) or green (downregulated) fold changes of IFN-inducible genes induced at 8, 18, and 28 hpi in human monocytes. all fold changes were 1.5 except for underscored values.

Activating kinase IKBKB (IKK, 0.68 to 1.00) was upregulated up to 4-fold, binding to TANK-binding kinase 1. the inhibitors of NF-B signaling, IB (NFKBIA, 7.10 to 7.18) and IB (NFKBIB, 1.86 to 2.72), both IB inhibitor proteins, were upregulated. NFKBIE (2.18 to 2.35) and NFKBIZ (7.42 to 8.64), which inhibit NF-B signaling. NF-B signaling was activated in both canonical and noncanonical ways. upregulated TLR, tumor necrosis factor alpha, growth factors, and BAFF activated these pathways through similarly upregulated MyD88, Ras, CD40, and TRAF2/3/5/6. a number of proteins were downregulated, including those in the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway. downstream kinases and regulators, including IKK, CYPB, TANK, and IRF7, were critical to IRF3/7 pathway activation. downregulation of MAVS from 18 hpi, which was negatively regulated by upregulated IFN-inducible ISG15 as a negative feedback, may restrain further induction of IFN at later stages of infection. cells were fected with the reporter plasmids, along with pRK5-Flag-NSs. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were stimulated with 50 g of synthetic poly(IC) dsRNA/ml or with the avian influenza virus H9N2 at an MOI of 0.5. lysates were subjected to lysis and the lysates were measured for luciferase activities. NF-B signaling is suppressed by NSs and N proteins. NSs protein suppressed Ig promoter activity down to 25% of the basal level in response to poly(IC) stimulation. luciferase activities were analyzed as RLU (A) and activation fold (B) transcript expression levels of FasL in infected cells were determined by real-time RT-PCR. we searched cellular proteins critical in innate immunity, IRF, and NF-B signaling pathways. THP-1 cells were pretreated with inhibitors of NF-B (100 nM) or IKK (10 M) for 1 h. at 24 hpi, total RNA was prepared for reverse transcription. cDNA were subjected to real-time PCR for quantifying S gene copies in the infected cells. increased expression of the inhibitors such as IB, including NFKBIA, NFKBIB, NFKBIE, and NFKBIZ, may contribute to decreased activation of NF-B. increased expression of the inhibitors such as IB, including NFKBIA, NFKBIB, NFKBIE, and NFKBIZ, may contribute to decreased activation of NF-B. SFTSV replicates in human monocytes without inducing apoptosis. no obvious cytopathic effect was observed at 18 and 38 hpi. however, monocytes appeared to respond to the infection. infected monocytes were stained positively at 18 or 28 hpi. we quantified the percentage of the THP-1 cells that were positive in the IFA. within the initial 8 hpi only 10% of the cells were positive. the oligonucleotide primers specific for viral S gene are listed in Table 1. the cellular genes used in the present study are listed in Fig. 2. to confirm that no apoptosis was initiated, we analyzed lysates of infected cells at 3, 6, 9, 12, 24, and 36 hpi for pro-caspase-3 and cleaved caspase-3 protein levels. the results showed that the level of pro-caspase-3 was not decreased and the cleaved form of caspase-3 was not detected, indicating that no apoptosis was induced by SFTSV infection in monocytes ylate synthetase 1 (OAS1) in THP-1 cells infected with the virus at an MOI of 1. Mild induction of antiviral MX1 and OAS1 was detected up to 8- and 22-fold at 8 and 28 hpi. the levels were moderate in SFTSV-infected monocytes, suggesting that the responses may be somehow restrained. more IFN-inducible proteins were detected upregulated, including IFI35, IFI44, IFI44L, IFI6, IFIT1, IFIT3, IFIT5, IFITM1, IRF1, IRF9, ISG15, MX2 and OAS2. some inducible proteins have important roles in positive feedback of IFN responses, such as STAT1 and STAT2. total RNA from noninfected and infected cells at 8, 18, and 28 hpi were prepared. cRNA was labeled with Cy3-CTP before they were subjected to hybridization on A4x44 microarray slides. log ratios are depicted in red (upregulated) or green (downregulated) 002198.2 1.87 2.21 3.72 IRF9 NM_006084.4 2.26 2.15 2.52 ISG15 NM_005101.3 10.14 14.12 27.40 JUN NM_002228.3 5.57 4.82 5.16 MX1 NM_002462.3 13.91 21.48 27.96 MX2 NM_002463.1 5.88 7.77 12.53 OAS1 NM_002534.2 9.17 14.42 22.58 OAS 14314.3 7.71 13.41 23.71 IFIH1 NM_022168.2 6.80 10.03 11.77 IFIT2 NM_001547.4 5.64 17.50 47.01 IFNAR1 NM_000629.2 1.63 1.88 2.13 IFNAR2 NM_207585.1 1.21 1.21 1.63 IFNB NM_002176.2 2.28 12.36 31.96 IKBKB NM_001556.2 1.00 \u20131.45 \u2013 TBK1 NM_004180.2 2.02 2.05 2.50 TBK1 NM_013254.3 1.39 1.27 1.29 TNF NM_000594.2 20.86 17.71 21.60 TNFSF10 NM_003810.3 1.55 4.96 14.06 TNFAIP3 NM_145725.2 1.35 1.68 1.27 TRAF6 NM_145803.2 \u20131.05 \u20131.22 \u20131.23. binding to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1, 1.27 to 1.39), to form a complex (34) important in activation of both IFN and noncanonical NF-B signaling. NF-B signaling, IB (NFKBIA, 7.10 to 7.18) and IB (NFKBIB, 1.86 to 2.72), both IB inhibitor proteins, were upregulated. pathway analysis in human monocytes using IPA platform. NF-B was activated in both canonical and noncanonical ways. also upregulated were NF-B1 and NF-B2, which are processed to become p50 or p52 and translocated into the nucleus after binding to RelA. induced downstream kinases and regulators, including IKK, CYPB, TANK, and IRF7, were critical to IRF3/7 pathway activation. downregulation of MAVS from 18 hpi, which was negatively regulated by upregulated ISG15 as a negative feedback, may restrain further induction of IFN. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with the reporter plasmids, along with pRK5-Flag-NSs or a control plasmid. at 24 h posttransfection, the cells were stimulated with 50 g of synthetic poly(IC) dsRNA/ml or with the avian influenza virus H9N2. 5-N plasmid, pGL3-IFN-Luc and pRL8 for 24 h followed by stimulation with 50 g of poly(I:C)/ml. lysates were measured for luciferase activities. NF-B signaling is suppressed by NSs and N proteins. cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing NSs or N, followed by stimulation with 50 g of poly(I:C)/ml or 0.5 MOI of the avian influenza virus. the results of luciferase activities were analyzed as RLU (A) and activation fold (B) transient phosphorylation and activation of NF-B p65 (RelA) and NF-B2 were observed. cell lysates at various time points postinfection were prepared from noninfected or infected cells. increased phosphorylation of NF-B p65 (RelA) and NF-B2 were both observed. phosphorylated NF-B p65 and NF-B2 decreased at a later stage of infection. increased expression of the inhibitors such as IB, including NFKBIA, NFKBIB, NFKBIE, and NFKBIZ may contribute to decreased activation of NF-B. infectious virus titration also confirmed that virus titers in NF-B inhibitor-treated THP-1 cultures were significantly lower than those in nontreated cells. NF-B is critical to virus replication. SFTS poses a serious public health concern because it causes high mortality and its transmission routes are not entirely clear. production of type I IFNs is one of the defense mechanisms of the host innate immune system against virus infection (21, 42) there were almost no detectable levels of IFN observed in patients' blood serum (28), indicating that IFN production may be suppressed, especially at a later stage of the infection. TNFAIP3 and ISG15 were all upregulated and acted in a negative-feedback manner. the nonstructural protein, NSs of SFTSV, might be implicated in the suppression of the IFN induction. well-known IFN antagonists are the NS1 protein of influenza A virus. NSs of RVFV can suppress IFN production by targeting the upstream component of the signaling pathway, in this case, PKR. NSs of another sandfly fever Sicilian virus, and Orthobunyavirus La Cross virus, do not have this function. an apparent IFN induction occurred in THP-1 cells after infection. the suppression of IFN and NF-B responses by NSs and nucleoproteins is complete in the infected human monocytes. however, the presence of a large portion of the cells was in fact stimulated in response to signaling from the infected cells. NF-B2 at the early stage of infection indicates the activation of NF-B signaling. despite the transcriptional upregulation of IKK, we failed to detect the activation of IKK/. NF-B signaling may be activated through other mechanisms, such as activating TBK1/TRIF through TLR signaling. infected cells will eventually be targeted by specific CD8+ T cells. free viruses will be cleared by neutralizing antibodies if patient survives. more study is needed to ascertain molecular events involved in viral pathogenesis."}
