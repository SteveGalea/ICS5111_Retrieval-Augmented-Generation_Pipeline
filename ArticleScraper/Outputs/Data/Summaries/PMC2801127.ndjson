{"summary": "IBV is an enveloped virus and has a positive-sense, single-stranded, RNA genome. the virion has three major structural proteins namely the nucleocapsid (N) protein, the membrane (M) protein, and the spike (S) glycoprotein. the S1 subunit, located on the outside of the virion, is responsible for the fusion between the virus envelope and the host cell membrane. the objective of this study was to characterize IBV field isolates in the recent outbreak of the disease in Thailand by analyzing the S1 gene and comparing them with those published previously. chickens showed respiratory symptoms including gasping, coughing, sneezing, and tracheal rales. first amplification reaction was carried out with one-step RT-PCR. primer sets of FOR1 (5'-CTT TTG TTT GCA CTA TGT AG-3') and RE3 (5'-TAA TAA CTC TGA GCT GT-3') Purified RT-PCR products were sequenced in a forward direction using primer FOR1 and in a reverse direction using primer RE3. Sequencing reactions were run on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. sequences of the S1 gene of the Thai IBV isolates were compared with published IBV sequences deposited in the GenBank database. thirteen poultry farms in the eastern part of Thailand had an outbreak of a mild-to-moderate respiratory disease. chickens showed respiratory symptoms including gasping, coughing, sneezing, and tracheal rales. the reaction was performed with AccessQuick RT-PCR System (Promega, USA) the first amplification reaction was carried out with one-step RT-PCR using the primer sets of FOR1 (5'-CTT TTG TTT GCA CTA TGT AG-3') and RE3 (5'-TAA TAA CTC TGA GCT GT-3') purified RT-PCR products were cut from the gel and purified using the Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up system (Promega, USA) according to manufacturer's protocol. sequences were run on an ABI Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer. sequences of the S1 gene of the Thai IBV isolates were compared with published IBV sequences deposited in the GenBank database. a 400-bp fragment of the S1 gene was amplified in all 13 samples tested. a segment of 878-bp of the S1 gene was obtained. a phylogenetic tree was constructed from the nucleotide sequences of S1 genes. group I Thai IBV isolates had nucleotide and amino acid sequence identities between 99100% with each other. they had nucleotide sequence identities less than 85% and amino acid sequence identities less than 84% with IBVs published in the GenBank database. group II consisted of eight isolates including THA30151, THA 70151, THA 80151, THA100151, THA110351, THA120351, and THA130551, which had a close relationship with Chinese IBV isolates. nucleotide and amino acid sequence comparison The S1 gene of the thirteen IBV isolates was sequenced to characterize the isolates. IBV isolates in group I could not be detected with the primer set and PCR method described by Gelb et al. to overcome this problem, the new primer sets were designed and the nested RT-PCR was developed. the region amplified by the outer primer covering the HVR of the S1 gene could represent the grouping method based on the whole S1 gene. IBV isolates in group I were genetically related to Chinese strains. new serotypes or variant strains can emerge as a result of only a few changes in the amino acid composition of S1 gene."}
