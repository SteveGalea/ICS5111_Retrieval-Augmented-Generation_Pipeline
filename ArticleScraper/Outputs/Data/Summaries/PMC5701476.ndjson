{"summary": "HCoV-229E is one of the causative agents of the common cold. it is increasingly associated with more severe respiratory infections in children, elders, and individuals with underlying medical conditions. the presence of HCoV-229E within clinical samples is typically confirmed by molecular (e.g., reverse transcription-PCR [RT-PCR] targeting of virus-specific genes) HCoV-229E viral genomic RNA (vRNA) was detected using a GenMark multiplex PCR eSensor XT-8 respiratory viral panel. its identity was supported by the generation of correct-sized PCR amplicons using RT-PCR assays targeting HCoV-229E-specific genes (12\u201314) next-generation sequencing (NGS) with a cDNA library prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA library prep kit. complete genome sequence of HCoV-229E strain 229E/Haiti-1/2016 has been deposited in the GenBank database."}
