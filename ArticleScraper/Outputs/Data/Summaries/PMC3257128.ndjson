{"summary": "hypertension is one of the striking factors inducing diseases like heart failure, stroke, myocardial infarction and arterial aneurysm. chymase catalyzes the production of angiotensin II in vascular tissues even when ACE is blocked. the rate of this conversion by chymase is approximately four fold higher than ACE. hamster chymases cleave the angiotensin I at Phe8-His9 peptide bond. both TGF- and MMP-9 are involved in tissue inflammation and fibrosis, resulting in organ damage. inhibition of chymase is likely to divulge therapeutic ways for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, allergic inflammation, and fibrotic disorders. 3-diazetidine-2,4-dione derivatives [16], methyllinderone derivatives [17], 1-oxacephem derivatives [19], 3-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-phenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives [19], and 3-(phenylsulfonyl)-1-phenylimidazolidine-2,4-dione derivatives [20] have been reported previously a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study is a helpful approach to quantitatively understand the relationships between molecular structures of inhibitors and their biological activities. a 3D-QSAR study is a helpful approach to quantitatively understand the relationships between molecular structures of inhibitors and their biological activities. an exclusive computational strategy is applied by using various QSAR model building techniques such as pharmacophore modeling, molecular docking, and density functional theory (DFT) the results of this study are expected to explore the crucial molecular features contributing to binding specificity and be useful for understanding the molecular mechanism by which these compounds act. hypotheses were generated using a training set of 20 compounds. the hypotheses are generated with cost functions and correlation values. the fixed cost, total cost and null cost values are calculated by hypoGen module during the hypotheses generation. the configuration cost value of 16.601 was obtained for this pharmacophore generation calculation. seven of the 10 hypotheses were made of five pharmacophores. the HY-AR was the common feature among all hypotheses. nine of the 10 hypotheses had Hydrogen-bond acceptor (HBA), three hypotheses had ring aromatic (RA) and only one hypothesis was made of hydrogen bond donor (HBD). hypo1 consists of two HBA and three HY-AR features. the estimated activity values of most and least active compounds of the training set were 0.27 and 4800 nM, respectively. the estimated activity values of most and least active compounds of the training set were 0.27 and 4800 nM. most active compound 1 could map all the features of the best pharmacophore model, Hypo1 with a fit value of 9.04. all three phenyl rings present in this most active compound mapped over three HY-AR features. the most active compound maps hypo1 with a fit value of 4.79 missed two HY-AR features as compared to compound 1. ++++ ++ 71 550 491.7 1.0 ++ ++ ++ 22 1 1.00 1.0 ++++ ++ ++ 71 550 592.4 1.0 ++ ++ ++ 23 2 65.84 32.9 ++++++ +++ 72 580 579.668 1.0 ++ ++ ++ 73 600 601.005 1.0 ++ ++ 73 600 601.005 1.0 ++ ++ 73 600 601.005 1.0 ++ ++ ++ 87 1400 552.461 2.5 ++ ++ 39 50 50.85 1.0 +++ +++ 88 1650 1645.71 1.0 +++ +++ 89 1650 551.849 2.9 ++ ++ 41 58 56.72 1.0 +++ +++ 90 1700 524.94 3.2 ++ ++ 42 70 71.11 1.0 +++ +++ 91 1800 1821.04 1.0 ++ ++ 43 70 70.25 1.0 +++ +++ ++ 105 3000 2980.04 1.0 + + 57 250 249.79 1.0 ++ 106 3100 3021.26 1.0 + + 57 250 249.79 1.0 ++ 106 3100 3021.26 1.0 + + 58 270 40.16 6.7 ++ ++ 107 3200 3351.54 1.0 + + 59 300 546.21 1.8 ++ ++ 108 3300 3370.61 1.0 + + + 60 300 521.0 eight out of nine of the most active compounds were estimated in the same activity scale. the ninth compound was predicted as moderately active. seventeen out of 26 moderately active compounds were estimated in the same activity scale, whereas the remaining nine were estimated as less active compounds. 67 11 101.143 72.068 1.593 0.894 12 116.666 74.077 1.959 0.834 13 114.356 69.48 1.97 0.834 14 98.277 77.638 1.433 0.913 15 108.878 72.047 1.753 0.872 16 117.228 78.041 1.961 0.831 17 102.183 78.085 1.359 0.926 18 113.597 77.563 1.891 0.843 19 the 49 compounds of Chembridge database and 23 compounds from Maybridge database have satisfied the Lipinsiki\u2019s rule of five for a drug-like compound. these 72 hit compounds that satisfied the Lipinsiki\u2019s rule of five from a total of 181 hits were subjected to molecular docking. the most active compound of training set scored a docking score of 66.6. compound 1 also showed hydrophobic interactions with Y215 and L99 amino acids. a third hit, JFD00311, with the estimated activity value of 4.661 nM and GOLD fitness score of 74.51. the benzene rings and oxygen atoms of the benzenesulfonic acid moieties in this hit compound overlaid the HY-AR and HBA features of \u201cHypo1\u201d respectively. the mapping of these top three database final hits on hypo1 and their 2D molecular structures are depicted in Figures 8 and 9 respectively. Fukui first recognized the importance of frontier orbitals as principal factors governing the ease of chemical reactions and the stereoselective path. parr and Yang demonstrated that most frontier theories can be rationalized from DFT. a clear trend between the inhibitory activity (IC50) data and LUMO energy of all compounds was also revealed. for all compounds, LUMO energy ranged between 0.631 and 2.275 eV. HOMO and LUMO sites are plotted onto molecular surface of most active (1) and least active (20) compounds. the HOMO plot is scattered on 2-methoxyphenol group and dihydroquinazolin moiety. the six membered ring part of dihydroquinazolin group is involved in important interactions with the side chain imidazole ring of his57 amino acid. phosphate nucleotide rapidly toward the bottom of the internal cavity of membrane-protein mitochondrial ADP/ATP carrier by forming a privileged passageway [65]. Considering these discoveries comprehensively, we assumed that the electrostatic potential of the inhibitor also played a significant role in the binding and interaction with chymase together with orbital energy. in the case of the least active compound 20, most negative potentials due to sulfonyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms are missing. however, in the case of the least active compound 20, most negative potentials due to sulfonyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms are missing. hypotheses are generated with cost functions and correlation values. the fixed cost is the lowest possible cost representing a hypothetically simplest model that fits all data perfectly. the null cost value is equal to the maximum occurring error cost.

LUMO energy ranged between 0.631 and 2.275 eV. least active compounds 19 and 20 showed LUMO with lowest energies. HOMO and LUMO sites are plotted onto the molecular surface of most active (1) and least active (20) compounds. HOMO plot is scattered on 2-methoxyphenol group and dihydroquinazolin moiety. LUMO and LUMO are composed of methoxybenzene, benzoindazole moieties, and oxadiazole substituted pyridine moiety. overlay of HTS on \u201cHypo1\u201d and its docking with the protein also speculated the involvement in key interactions with the active site of protein. the 3D isosurface maps of MESP were interpolated on the electron density surfaces of constant electron charge density (0.0004 e/au3) the electrostatic potential is defined as the interacted energy of a positively remote charge point with the nuclei and the electrons of a molecule. the 3D plots of electron density (ED) and the MESP for compounds 1, 20, BTB and HTS are shown in Figure 12. localized negative potential regions located at the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl and sulfonyl groups and nitrogen of the pyridine ring are consistent with the docking results. one more prominent localized negative charged region protruding over the oxadiazole group was oriented adjacent to Gly193 to be recognized as a hydrogen bond acceptor. the frontier orbitals HOMO and LUMO of a chemical species are very important in defining its reactivity. Fukui recognized the importance of frontier orbitals as principal factors governing the ease of chemical reactions and the stereoselective path. a clear trend between the inhibitory activity (IC50) data and LUMO energy of all compounds was also revealed. for all compounds, LUMO energy ranged between 0.631 and 2.275 eV. most active compounds 19 and 20 showed LUMO with lowest energies. methylbenzenesulfonamide group in hit compounds BTB showed hydrogen bonding interactions with important amino acids Gly193 and Ser195 at the active site of the enzyme. the six membered ring part of dihydroquinazolin group is involved in important interactions with the side chain imidazole ring of his57 amino acid. the 3D isosurface maps of MESP were interpolated on the electron density surfaces of constant electron charge density (0.0004 e/au3) the electrostatic potential is defined as the interacted energy of a positively remote charge point with the nuclei and the electrons of a molecule. most negative potentials due to sulfonyl and carbonyl oxygen atoms are missing. appearance of localized negative potential regions located at the oxygen atoms of the carbonyl and sulfonyl groups and nitrogen of the pyridine ring are consistent with docking results. experimentally known inhibitory activity (IC50) data was compiled from literature such as life science journals [14\u201320,55,66\u201368] to form a training set, 20 compounds with distinctive structural motif and wide activity range (0.46 to 5900 nM) were selected. for all compounds in the training set, energy minimization process was performed with CHARMM forcefield. the top 10 hypotheses which were returned by the hypotheses generation process were selected for further calculations. the generated quantitative pharmacophore model was validated to find out whether it is competent enough to identify the active structures and estimate their activity values precisely. the validation process was performed based on test set prediction and Fischer randomization methods. independent dataset test and subsampling test cannot avoid arbitrariness. results obtained by jackknife cross-validation are always unique for a given benchmark dataset. independent dataset test and subsampling test can exclude the arbitrariness. a molecule must fit all the features of the pharmacophore hypothesis. the hits obtained through database screening were further filtered using Lipinsiki\u2019s rule of five in order to carry only drug-like compounds in further studies. the GOLD fitness score is calculated from the contributions of hydrogen bond and van der Waals interactions between the protein and ligand, intramolecular hydrogen bonds and strains of the ligand. the protein\u2013ligand interactions were scrutinized by DS. 3.3. a set of 117 structurally distinct compounds reported as chymase inhibitors with their diverse experimentally known inhibitory activity (IC50) data was compiled from literature such as life science journals [14\u201320,55,66\u201368]. to form a training set, 20 compounds with distinctive structural motif were selected. hypogen algorithm implemented for the pharmacophore hypothesis generation process is executed in three phases. hypotheses showing best correlation in the 3D arrangement of features in a given training set compounds with the corresponding pharmacological activities are formed and ranked. the jackknife test can exclude the \u201cmemory\u201d effect or bias. a model or predictor achieving a higher success rate might fail to keep so when tested by another independent testing dataset. a subsampling test can exclude the arbitrariness. a test set comprising 97 compounds with experimentally known chymase inhibitory activity values was used in test set prediction method. Ligand Pharmacophore Mapping protocol running with BEST/Flexible conformation generation option was applied on training set compounds. a pharmacophore is only useful as a predictive model in finding novel, potential leads suitable for further development only if it is able to detect new potential leads. poling algorithm was applied to generate 255 diverse conformations with the energy threshold of 20 kcalmol1 above the calculated energy minimum for every compound in the dataset. the method ensures the best coverage of conformational space by performing a more rigorous energy minimization in both torsional and cartesian space. independent dataset test, subsampling test, and jackknife test are deemed the most objective. a test method unable to yield a unique outcome cannot be deemed a good one. a test method unable to yield a unique outcome cannot be deemed as a good one. the benchmark dataset will be singled out one-by-one and tested by the model or predictor trained by the remaining samples. the jackknife cross-validation is always unique for a given benchmark dataset. the independent dataset test and subsampling test can be avoided. docking is a useful vehicle for investigating the interaction of a protein receptor with its ligand and revealing their binding mechanism. a series of studies have shown that docking plays a significant role in predicting binding orientation and affinity of small molecule drug candidates to their protein targets with known 3D structures. DFT is most likely one of the best methods to study medium-size or larger molecular systems and appropriate for QSAR study. a useful kind of net atomic charges, called electrostatic potential (ESP)-fitting charges, were derived from the DFT calculated molecular electrostatic potential distribution using CHelpG method. the formatted checkpoint files of the compounds generated by the geometric optimization computation were used as input for CUBEGEN program interfaced with Gaussian 03 program to compute the MESP. the MESP isopotential surfaces was produced and superimposed onto the total electron density surface (0.0004 e/au3) the electrostatic potential of the whole molecule is finally obtained by superimposing the electrostatic potentials upon the total electron density surface of the compound. web-servers represent the future direction for developing practically more useful models or predictors [91]. the results of this study will be helpful, not only in the development of new potent hits for chymase, but also in providing a better understanding of the interaction between the chymase and inhibitors."}
