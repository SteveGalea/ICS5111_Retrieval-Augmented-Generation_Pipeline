{"summary": "introduction of IAV of the H1N1, H2N2 and H3N2 subtypes has caused pandemics in 1918, 1957 and 1968 respectively. more recently, H1N1 viruses of swine origin caused the first pandemic of the 21st century, which started in Mexico in March 2009 [1], [2]. avian influenza viruses of the H5N1 subtype cause infections of humans relatively frequent. adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) inhibit the proton-channel function of the Matrix2 (M2) protein. this protein functions as an ion-channel and plays a role in the uncoating of the genetic material which is an essential step in the virus replication cycle. the other class of antiviral drugs comprises the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir. SP-D belongs to the collectin family, which is an important class of innate immunity proteins involved in the early response against pathogens. they can neutralize a variety of respiratory pathogens including bacteria and viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza virus, adenoviruses and adenoviruses. pSP-D has a higher affinity to IAV than human or rat SP-D. it was shown with pSP-D isolated from porcine bronchoalveolar lavage. it remains unknown what range of IAV strains can be neutralized by pSP-D and hSP-D. avian swine and human IAV of the H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 subtypes are listed in table 1. all the viruses were propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK, ATCC CCL-34) cells. the culture supernatants of the infected MDCK were clarified by low speed centrifugation. native pSP-D (NpSP-D) was isolated from pig lungs. the basic cleavage site in the HA protein was deleted. the basic cleavage site in the HA protein was deleted by site-directed mutagenesis. hSP-D expression plasmids were transfected into HEK293-EBNA1 cells. expression media were harvested after 5 days, a solution of CaCl2 was added. eluted SP-D was separated by size exclusion chromatography. tination units (HAU) of the respective viruses diluted in PBS-CM were added. after 1 h, 25 l of 1% turkey erythrocytes were added. as a negative control, the experiment was performed in PBS without CaCl2. FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody preparation (AbD Sigma-Aldricht) for 30 minutes at room temperature. 100 l of various concentrations of RpSP-D or peanut agglutinin were incubated with 100 l of the respective virus preparations containing 3000TCID50 diluted in PBS-CM for 1 h at room temperature. the cells were washed once with PBS-CM and twice with PBS FITC-labeled virus was incubated with the tissue sections. binding of virus was detected using a peroxidase labeled rabbit anti-FITC antibody preparation (DAKOCytomation, Glostrup, Denmark) dilutions were made in PBS-CM. the tissue sections were incubated with FITC-labelled virus for 1 h. after washing the slides with PBS containing 5 mM of EDTA and 0.05% Tween they were further developed. mM KH2PO4 pH 6.6, 4% butanol to 400 mM KH2PO4 pH 6.6, 1% butanol. equilibrated with 50 mM MES pH 6.6, 5% glycerol, 8 mM CaCl2. neuraminidase inhibition assay was adapted from the WHO protocol. 7.1 g anhydrous sodium sulfate and 100 ml H2O were added and mixed to the rest until the brown color disappeared. the mixtures were transferred to micronic tubes, 200 l of Warrenhoff reagent was added and each tube was vortexed. an ethical assessment is not mandatory for secondary purpose use of tissues or organs collected from carcasses. Viruses Thirty viruses were selected based on their subtype and species of origin and included avian swine and human IAV of the H1N1, H3N2 and H5N1 subtypes. the characteristics of these strains are listed in table 1. an A/mallard/Netherlands/15/05 M/NL/15/05 A/mallard/Netherlands/24/06 M/NL/06 A/white fronted goose/Netherlands/1/07 WFG/NL/07 A/common teal/Netherlands/10/00 CT/NL/00 Swine A/swine/Oedenrode/7C/96 S/OR/96 A/swine/Netherlands/849/93 S/NL six months old surplus pigs were used that were euthanized for other purposes. in short, NpSP-D was isolated from lung lavage by affinity purification method. eluted SP-D was separated by size exclusion chromatography into differently assembled forms. nin was made using Dulbecco's phosphate buffered saline containing PBS containing 1 mM of CaCl2 and 0.5 mM of MgCl2, PBS-CM. to 100 l of the diluted SP-D, 2 hemagglutination units (HAU) of the respective viruses were added. after 1 h, 25 l of 1% turkey erythrocytes were added. the cells were incubated with a monoclonal antibody directed to pSP-D diluted 1100 in PBS-CM for 30 minutes at room temperature. the cells were incubated with a FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse IgG antibody preparation (AbD Sigma-Aldricht) for 30 minutes at room temperature. the cells were washed twice with cytoperm (BD Biosciences, San Diego, CA) and incubated with a monoclonal antibody specific for the viral nucleoprotein. after washing with P2F, the cells were analyzed by flow-cytometry using the DIVA software. FITC-labeled virus was incubated with the tissue sections and binding was detected using a peroxidase labeled rabbit anti-FITC antibody preparation. tyramide signal amplification system (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA) dilutions made in PBS-CM. tissue sections were incubated with 3% H2O2 for 10 min. tissue sections were incubated with FITC-labelled virus for 1 h. the aquous phase, containing NA, was adjusted to 5 mM KH2PO4 pH 6.6, 4% butanol. the column was eluted using a linear gradient of 5 mM KH2PO4 pH 6.6, 4% butanol to 400 mM KH2PO4 pH 6.6, 1% butanol. the column was eluted using a linear gradient of 5 mM KH2PO4 pH 5 l of periodate reagent (4.28 g of sodium meta-Periodate in 38 ml H2O) was added. 25 l of arsenite reagent (10 g sodium arsenite, 7.1 g anhydrous sodium sulfate and 100 ml H2O) was added and mixed to the rest. s were tested against 15 H1N1 and 12 H3N2 IAV of swine, human and avian origin. HI assays were performed three times independently. the activity of both preparations was shown to be dependent on the presence of calcium ions. panel A shows the results of individual H1N1 (B) and H3N2 (C) viruses. the average concentrations obtained in six independent experiments are shown. the results obtained in four independent experiments are shown. human IAVs of the H1N1 subtype were susceptible to the inhibitory activity of RpSP-D. on average, 17 ng/100 l was already sufficient to fully inhibit hemagglutination against the human H1N1 IAVs. the classical swine virus Swine/Iowa/15/30 was not susceptible to inhibition by RpSP-D at the maximum concentration tested (>500 ng/100 l) multimers inhibit IAV more efficiently than trimers HEK293 cell-derived RpSP-D and RhSP-D preparations. the inhibitory capacity of both forms was compared with the respective viruses in the HI assay. on average, 39.8 ng/100 l of RpSP-D multimers was required to inhibit hemagglutination. species in the HI assay using a panel of altogether 27 of H1N1 and H3N2 IAVs. it was found that RpSP-D inhibited IAV of the H1N1 subtype more efficiently than RhSP-D. the minimal inhibitory concentration of RpSP-D ranged from 4 ng/100 l to 318 ng/100 l. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids from which the HA and NP genes of influenza virus A/Netherlands/178/95 (H3N2) were expressed. without RpSP-D, no fluorescence was observed confirming the specificity of the staining. pSP-D antibody and goat anti-mouse FITC labeled antibody were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. no binding of RpSP-D was detected in cells transfected with a plasmid encoding the NP gene, which was included as negative control. cells expressing the HA gene bound RpSP-D. at the highest concentration tested, on average 77.7% inhibition was observed for the pandemic 2009 H1N1 viruses, 47.2% for the classical swine viruses, 24.9% for the avian-like swine viruses and 68.5% for the human seasonal H1N1 viruses. at the highest dose tested, 84.9% inhibition was achieved for the swine H3N2 viruses, 72.9% for the human and 29.6% with the human H1N1 viruses enzymatic activity of neuraminidase derived from IAV strains A/crested eagle/Belgium/01/2004 (N1) (A) and A/Victoria/3/75 (N2) (B) was determined after overnight incubation in presence of various doses of peanut agglutinin (open square), ConA (open circle), oseltamivir (closed circle) or RpSP-D (closed triangle) FITC-labeled virus prevented binding at a minimal dose of 0.1 g for the H1N1 virus and 10 g for the H3N2 virus. a dose of 1 g did not prevent the binding of the H3N2 virus completely. the inhibition of virus attachment was dependent on the presence of Ca2+-ions. two control lectins, peanut agglutinin and pokeweed mitogen, failed to prevent virus attachment. in contrast, ConA blocked virus attachment at a concentration of 1 g/150 l. we also tested the effect of RpSP-D on virus attachment using human trachea tissue. the minimum inhibitory concentration of RpSP-D and NpSP-D required to inhibit the hemagglutination by all 27 IAVs was assessed (A) the horizontal line indicates the average of the minimal inhibitory concentration for both preparations which did not differ significantly. each symbol in panels A and B represent an individual IAV strain. the H3N2 viruses tested are NL/09 (closed diamond), S/NL/1/87 (closed triangle), NJ/76 (closed square), NL/06 (open square), NL/08 (open circle), NL/03 (open triangle), NL/93 (closed triangle), M/Sweden/03 (closed circle), M/NL/08 (closed circle), M/Sweden/03 (closed circle), M/NL/07 (closed square) all viruses of the H5N1 subtype tested, HongKong/156/97 (clade0), VietNam/1194/04 (clade1) and Indonesia/5/05 (clade2.1) were not in particular susceptible and high concentrations of RpSP-D were required to prevent the hemagglutination by these viruses. on average, 39.8 ng/100 l of RpSP-D multimers was required to inhibit hemagglutination by all influenza A influenza A/swine/Netherlands/1/87 was not inhibited by the trimers of RpSP-D at the minimal concentration tested (1600 ng/100 l) also for the inhibition of all the influenza A/H3N2 viruses tested the minimal inhibitory concentration of multimers was significantly lower than that of the trimers (8.7 ng/100 l 124 ng/100 l respectively) in panel C, the minimal inhibitory concentrations of RhSP-D multimers (black bars) and trimers (white bars) were compared. the data represent the average of three independent experiments. a similar pattern was observed for the inhibition of the all A/H3N2 viruses tested. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA or NP genes derived from influenza virus A/Netherlands//178/95 (H3N2) without RpSP-D, no fluorescence was observed confirming the specificity of the staining. without RpSP-D, no fluorescence was observed confirming the specificity of the staining. swine H3N2 (A), human H3N2 (B), avian H3N2 (C), 2009 pandemic H1N1 (D), avian-like swine H1N1 (E), classical swine (F), human H1N1 (G), avian H1N1 (H) and H5N1 (I) were grouped by subtype and origin. a reduction of infection of 45.6% was observed with the human H3N2 viruses and 29.6% with the human H1N1 viruses. the viruses of the H5N1 subtype were poorly inhibited even when a high concentration of RpSP-D was used. oseltamivir inhibited enzymatic activity the NA of A/crested eagle/Belgium/01/2004 (H5N1) by 85% and the activity of A/Victoria/3/75(H3N2) by 75%. both viruses bind to epithelial cells of ferret trachea which is visible as red precipitate. attachment of virus in absence or presence of RpSP-D was studied by virushistochemistry. sections of ferret trachea (A) or human trachea (B) were incubated with FITC-labeled IAV A/Netherlands/35/05 (H1N1) and A/Netherlands/231/03 (H3N2) in the absence or presence of various doses of RpSP-D. the antiviral activity of RpSP-D was assessed against a wide range of IAV strains. the biochemical properties of the recombinant protein need to resemble those of the native protein. the biochemical properties of RpSP-D were characterized in detail. wine IAVs of the H1N1 subtype were inhibited inefficiently. at least 100-fold more RhSP-D than RpSP-D was required. only viruses of the H5N1 subtype were inhibited inefficiently. highly assembled RpSP-D neutralizes IAV better than trimeric form. most likely multimerisation increases the avidity of the SP-D molecules. another potential viral target that could be bound or inhibited by RpSP-D is the NA of IAV. binding of human IAV H1N1 and H3N2 viruses to paraffin-embedded tissues may not reflect the virus-tissue interaction in vivo exactly. binding patterns of various influenza viruses to respiratory tract tissue correlate with pathogenesis and transmissibility of these viruses."}
