{"summary": "viral mutation, drug resistance, and viral reemergence pose problems for global control and eradication efforts. there are no treatments, licensed vaccines, or antiviral drugs for acute EBOV infection. there are other gaps in the armamentarium against global viral infections. ethyl 6-bromo-4-[(dimethylamino)methyl]-5-hydroxy-1-methyl-2-(phenylsulfanylmethyl)indole-3-carboxylate;hydrate;hydrochloride has broad-spectrum antiviral activity. ARB was developed in Russia to combat influenza virus (8). the university of washington used the nonclinical and preclinical services program offered by the national Institute of allergy and infectious diseases. for HHV-8, BCBL-1 cells were induced to undergo lytic replication by the addition of 100 ng/ml phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate. one hour later, activated cells were seeded in 96-well plates containing 5-fold dilutions of ARB. working dilutions were made in complete minimal essential medium (MEM) supernatants were harvested at 96 h postinfection and diluted in most instances at least 100-fold prior to titration on vero E6 cells. this dilution step reduced the concentration of carryover ARB to less than 0.1 g/ml, which does not inhibit EBOV. replication by 50% (EC50) and concentration of compound that causes 50% cytotoxicity (CC50) were calculated using PRISM 4.0. the ratio of antiviral EC50 to CC50 was used to calculate a selectivity index (SI) (CC50/EC50) t tests were performed to compare differences between controls and doses of ARB. the replicated DNA was then isolated and quantified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) using methods reported previously (13). the replicated DNA was then isolated and quantified using qPCR. the resultant titer data are reflective of ARB suppression of EBOV replication in HepG2 cells. titer data are reflective of ARB suppression of EBOV replication in HepG2 cells. RESULTS ARB inhibits early stages of Ebola virus infection. cells were pretreated for 24 h with 0 to 18.8 M ARB before infection with wild-type EBOV. at the highest dose of 18.8 M ARB, more than a 4-log inhibition of EBOV was observed. titers were determined on vero E6 cells. light micrographs of the mock- and EBOV-infected cells. images were captured at 120 h postinfection. compared to control treated cells, ARB caused significant suppression of EBOV infection at all tested doses when added before, during, or immediately after infection. higher doses of ARB (i.e., 2.35 and 4.7 M) failed to inhibit EBOV. however, higher doses of ARB still showed significant suppression. supernatants were harvested at 24 h postinfection, and titers were determined on naive vero cells. values represent mean viral titers, and error bars represent the standard error of the mean for triplicate cultures. ARB inhibits HHV-8 replication to a similar extent as cidofovir. human BCBL-1 cells were treated with ARB or CDV. HHV-8 DNA was quantified by reverse transcription-PCR. cell viability was measured by cell Titer Glow assay. the experiment was performed three independent times. the replicates are designated cytotoxicity 1, cytotoxicity 2, and cytotoxicity 3. Error bars are standard deviation. ARB was added to cells 24 h before, at the same time as, 1 h after, or 24 h after virus adsorption. compared to control treated cells, ARB caused significant suppression of EBOV infection at all tested doses when added before, during, or immediately after infection. supernatants harvested at 96 h postinfection were determined by viral plaque assay. error bars represent the standard error of the mean for triplicate cultures. recombinant VSV expressing the GP from the Zaire isolate inhibited virus replication. poliovirus, HHV-8, Tacaribe virus, and HBV were inhibited by ARB. the primary hits against poliovirus, HHV-8, and HBV were confirmed in secondary testing by NIAID. ARB inhibited HHV-8 replication to a similar extent as cidofovir. EBOV and HHV-8 also enter cells by macropinocytosis (32\u201336) it will be important to discriminate actions of ARB on clathrin versus macropinocytic routes of entry. the other herpesviruses not inhibited by ARB, including herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) (37), HSV-2 and human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) (38), and Epstein-Barr virus (39) the HHV-8 assay derives from induction of lytic replication from latently infected BCBL-1 cells. the HSV-1 assay deploys live virus in an acute-infection setting. further studies are required to sort out these possibilities. ARB may be considered for prophylactic use in hemorrhagic fever outbreaks. it could also limit the deadly spread of filoviruses and arenaviruses."}
