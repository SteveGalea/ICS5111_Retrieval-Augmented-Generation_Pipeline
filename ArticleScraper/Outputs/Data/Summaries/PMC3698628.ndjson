{"summary": "astrobiology is a relatively new field of study, so it is not an area many teachers would have encountered during their training. astrobiology outreach programs engage students' interest and give them an insight into how science is actually done. these programs demonstrate to students many aspects of the nature and processes of science that may not be apparent. students use Thinkspace to plan a rover mission to Mars and execute it in the Mars Yard. they also consider the evidence for the origins of life on earth and the relationship to looking for the geological and environmental evidence for the possibility of past or present life on Mars. students who subsequently \u201cself-identify\u201d as being interested in further exposure to the project are offered the opportunity to undertake a NASA student research project run by the Mars Education team. the purpose of this study is to examine the effects of these activities on students' understandings and attitudes. the research specifically profiles students taking part in the study to place the findings in context of the type of student undertaking these programs. study by Lyons and Quinn suggests primary school is not the influencing factor but student experiences in science in Years (Grades) 9 and 10. 66% of students who chose to end their science study in Year (Grade) 10 did so because they could not picture themselves as scientists. the data suggested that science did not fit with the identities of many of these students, particularly the girls. a large body of research shows that school students' understanding of the nature of science is generally poor. the major theme emerging from these interviews was of the creative aspect of science, a result that challenges the popular view of creativity and science as incompatible. the Choosing Science report (Lyons and Quinn, 2010) recommends strategies to improve links between school science and working scientists in order to give students authentic, research-based science experiences. the report recommends emphasizing the cross-disciplinary nature of science and integrating the principles and practices that scientists follow in their work into the science curriculum. 63% of students in science careers had started thinking about a career in science before the age of 14. a study by the royal Society found that by the time students reach the age of 14 they have already decided whether to continue their study of science. the majority (65%) reported their interest in science began before the end of primary school. the image of science portrayed in the classroom and the transmissive approach to teaching science are at odds with scientific practice. the image of science portrayed in the classroom and the transmissive approach to teaching science are at odds with scientific practice. students' perception of a mismatch between the culture of science and their self-image has been investigated by Kessels and Taconis (2011). they found that it was more important for students choosing to study science at a university to identify with the perceived culture of the field than it was for students choosing other fields of study. a student's image of science culture is often based on his or her image of a typical science teacher. methodology 2.1. Sampling Our sample consisted of 230 science students 15 to 16 years old attending either the Pathways to Space or the Mission to Mars programs. each program is essentially structured as a 1-day science excursion or field trip for Year 9 and 10 students accompanied by a teacher. Subscales Construct/Subscale Explanation/Description Observations and Inferences Observations are open to multiple valid interpretations. social and cultural influence on science culture determines what and how science is conducted, interpreted, and accepted. responses to be coded with numerical values, with a score of 1 representing the least informed view and a score of 5 representing the most informed view. a body of literature asserts the robustness of parametric analysis of Likert-type responses. the SUSSI questionnaire was developed and tested for reliability and validity over a number of years (Liang et al., 2005, 2008). Kind et al. (2007) derived their individual scale items from existing attitude scales and subjected their scale to rigorous testing. survey instruments A survey instrument was used in this research due to the relatively large sample size and the resources available. fixed-response instruments can be used with large numbers but allow more limited expression of views. the use of self-report data is also a limited form of program evaluation. both parametric and nonparametric methods of data analysis were used in this study. results are presented from surveys completed by 230 students, 121 attending Pathways to Space and 109 attending mission to Mars in 2011. the results are presented from surveys completed by 230 students. significant results from Paired Samples t Test Paired differences 95% Confidence interval of the difference Mean Std. deviation Std. error mean Lower Upper t df Sig. (2-tailed) Pair 1 Imagination and Creativity in Scientific Investigations pre - Imagination and Creativity in Scientific Investigations post. the median differences between Observations and Inferences pre and Observations and Inferences post equals 0. Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank test 0.021 Reject the null hypothesis. the dotted line indicates the \u201cNot sure\u201d point (3), with means above this indicating increasing agreement. the error bars indicate two standard errors above and below the mean value, which corresponds approximately to a 95% confidence interval. the lowest mean values show that the students generally have a negative attitude to any future science study. in the Choosing Science study, 15% of students agreed with the statement \"I would like to become a scientist when I leave school\" the percentage agreeing with the statement \"I would like to become a scientist\" in the current study, 17.3% of boys agreed that they would like to become a scientist compared with 11.4% of girls. the mean value for the concept of Imagination and Creativity in Scientific Investigations was still below the midpoint. the survey responses were all measured on the same 5-point Likert scale. responses to the Nature of Science scale items and the Attitudes to Science items may be viewed differently. 64.4% of students understood that observations are open to multiple valid interpretations, compared with 63.4% post-visit. stepwise linear regression analysis was carried out on the pre-visit data. the construct that contributed most was the Science outside of school construct. the results indicate that the students showed more awareness in the post-visit survey, that scientists use their imagination and creativity throughout their investigations. the students' awareness that scientists' observations are open to multiple valid interpretations showed a statistically significant decrease on the post-visit survey. the median differences between Observations and Inferences post equals 0. Related-Samples Wilcoxon Signed Rank test 0.021 Reject the null hypothesis. the lowest mean values, for Future participation in science, show that the students generally have a negative attitude to any future science study. the students do not view science more negatively than other school subjects, as shown by a comparison of the mean values of the Learning science in school and Attitude to school subscales. in the future participation in science subscale, relating to students' intentions to become scientists, has been used in previous research studies. 15% of students agreed with the statement \"I would like to become a scientist when I leave school\" the percentage agreeing with the statement \"I would like to become a scientist\" in the current study, 17.3% of boys agreed that they would like to become a scientist compared with 11.4% of girls. the mean value for the concept of Imagination and Creativity in Scientific Investigations was still below the midpoint. the survey responses were all measured on the same 5-point Likert scale. however, responses to the Nature of Science scale items and the Attitudes to Science items may be viewed differently. 64.4% of students understood that observations are open to multiple valid interpretations, compared with 63.4% post-visit. stepwise linear regression analysis was carried out on the pre-visit data. two constructs had standardized regression coefficients that were significant at the 95% confidence level. 45.2% of all students (40.4% of girls and 48.9% of boys) agree with the statement to some extent. this compares with only 30% of all students (more boys than girls) in the Choosing Science study. half chose not to study science after Year 10. the results of this study are in keeping with research indicating that many aspects of the Nature of Science are not well understood by school students. the role of creativity in science was not well understood by the students in this study, with almost 70% believing imagination and creativity are not part of a scientist's work. this result supports the findings by Masnick et al. (2010) that students see creativity and science as opposites. this was confirmed by parametric and nonparametric tests. a similar 1-day-long intervention conducted in 2008 did not reveal any change in student views. this result would have been more significant had there been a control group for comparison. astrobiology outreach can give students the opportunity to experience the way that science is actually done. it also shows that outreach activities can generate meaningful data to gauge their effectiveness and add to the understanding of how to build better projects in the future."}
