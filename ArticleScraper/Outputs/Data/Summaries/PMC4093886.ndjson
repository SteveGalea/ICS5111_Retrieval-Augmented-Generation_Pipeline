{"summary": "coronaviruses are positive-stranded enveloped RNA viruses with some of the largest viral genomes. they target a myriad of distinct animal hosts and cause disease in a number of organs, such as the brain, liver and lung. over 160 proteins have been identified as targets of ISG15. retinoic acid-inducible gene 1 (RIG-1), signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT-1), Janus-activated kinase-1 (JAK-1) and MxA (12\u201314) a balance of ISGylation and USP18 isopeptidase activity requires further elucidation. the role of ISGylation in viral life cycles is specific to the virus involved. it can exert an antiviral pressure against some infections but can also stimulate viral replication. a 60-fold higher affinity for ISG15-conjugated than Ub-modified substrates (18, 30) however, it is unknown whether targeting PLP2 activity in an in vitro cell culture system or in vivo will inhibit coronavirus replication. however, it is unknown whether targeting PLP2 activity in an in vitro cell culture system or in vivo will inhibit coronavirus replication. mice infected with MHV-3 were sacrificed at humane endpoints. animals were given chow and water ad libitum. the isolation of peritoneal exudative macrophages was previously described. the liver was perfused with solution 2 (0.02% collagenase IV [Sigma-Aldrich] with calcium and magnesium in HBSS) at 37\u00b0C and a rate of 7 ml/min using an infusion pump for 3 min. the liver was then carefully harvested into a petri dish containing DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS and 1 107 M insulin. cells were counted on a hemocytometer, and viability was determined by trypan primary hepatocytes were infected with MHV-3 (MOI of 1) and viral titers were assayed using a standard plaque assay. a time course of N protein production coincides with decreased N protein production in USP18/ hepatocytes. MHV-3 titers were assessed on monolayers of L2 cells. mice were infected with 50 PFU of MHV-3 and housed under sterile conditions. animals were monitored daily and sacrificed at a humane endpoint. the kit for IFN- was purchased from BioLegend, Inc. (San Diego, CA, USA) ELISAs were performed according to the manufacturers' instructions. mice were infected with MHV-3 and sacrificed on the indicated day(s) mouse glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) forward primer, 5\u2032-ACAACTTTGGCATTGTGGAA-3\u2032; mouse gAPDH reverse primer, 5\u2032-GATGCAGGGATGATGTTCTG-3\u2032; MHV-3 PLP2 forward primer, 5\u2032-AAATGTGGCTTGATGC-3\u2032; and MHV-3 PLP2 reverse primer, 5\u2032-CCTTCGCTAAGACCAAGG data are represented as means SD (***, P 0.001; **, P 0.01; *, P 0.05). mRNA expression of both type I and type II IFN is inhibited in USP18/ mice. mRNA was harvested from livers of USP18+/+ or USP18+/+ mice. onset of PLP2 expression is delayed in USP18/ mice. mRNA expression coincides with increased viral expression. mRNA was extracted on the indicted days. mouse monoclonal antibody (Sigma), anti-mouse ISG15 rabbit polyclonal antibody, anti-mouse Ube1L goat polyclonal IgG antibody. corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibodies were used: sheep anti-mouse IgG (GE Healthcare), donkey anti-rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) Isolated PEM were generated in-house according to Ratia et al. (34). cells were harvested at 9 h p.i., run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. results with a P value below 0.05 were considered significant. mice were injected with 2 ml of sterile 3% thioglycolate. animals were sacrificed after 3 days, and PEM were retrieved. DMEM supplemented with 15% FBS and 1 107 M insulin. cells were washed two times with DMEM plus insulin. viability was determined by trypan blue exclusion. hepatocytes were inoculated at an MOI of 1 and harvested at the indicated time points. N protein production is a marker of viral replication. the blot is representative of two independent experiments. sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin using standard protocols. sections were scored in a blinded fashion by an experienced liver pathologist. blood was harvested by cardiac puncture and incubated for 10 min. a microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed using a first Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit. the reverse transcriptase reaction was run as per the manufacturer's specifications. usP18/ mice showed delayed morbidity and death following MHV-3 infection. survival curve was prolonged up to 10 days, with a median survival of 8 days compared to 4 days for control mice. photomicrographs at day 4 and day 7 for USP+/+ and USP/ mice show confluent necrosis of the liver. mRNA was harvested from livers of USP18+/+ or USP18/ mice infected with 50 PFU of MHV-3 and sacrificed at day 3 p.i. mRNA expression of both type I and type II IFN is inhibited in USP18/ mice. real-time PCR was performed on an ABI Prism 7900H (Applied Biosystems) using a 96-well plate format. samples were normalized to HPRT and GAPDH. Isolated primary hepatocytes were plated at a density of 1 105 cells/ml in DMEM. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in 0.5% CO2, whereupon cells reached 60 to 80% confluence. DMEM including 10% fetal bovine serum was added. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software, version 5. survival curves were calculated using a log rank (Mantel-Cox) test. results with a P value below 0.05 were considered significant. MHV-3 infection of USP18/ mice did gradually lead to widespread liver damage. increased liver histology, viral titers, and liver function in USP18/ mice were improved at all time points compared with those in USP18+/+ mice. MHV-3 infection of USP18+/+ mice induced strong mRNA and protein expression of IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- in the liver and serum respectively. MHV-3 infection did not induce type I or type II IFN induction in USP18/ primary hepatocytes. titers increased in USP18/ hepatocytes with slower kinetics than in USP18+/+ mice, with nearly a log decrease in MHV-3 titers at almost all time points. in vitro results support the in vivo finding that MHV-3 viral titers are suppressed in the presence of increased ISGylation. d proteins are markedly higher in USP18/ hepatocytes than in USP18+/+ hepatocytes at all time points following MHV-3 infection. expression of viral nucleocapsid (N protein) is detectable by WB starting at 6 h p.i. in USP18+/+ hepatocytes, overall N protein accumulation is decreased and is delayed compared to that in USP18+/+ hepatocytes. MHV-3 infection decreased ISGylation in both USP18+/+ and USP18/ mice. however, decreased ISGylation was observed only following treatment with IFN- which strongly induces ISGylation. USP18+/+ PEM infected with MHV-3 showed strong expression of N protein at 9 h p.i. treatment with GRL0617, the PLP inhibitor with the highest binding capacity (34), resulted in the greatest decrease in viral N protein production. ISGylation exerts an antiviral pressure on MHV-3 coronavirus replication. however, this antiviral pressure is overcome as the virus replicates and expresses the deubiquitinase protein (DUB PLP2) as before, USP18+/+ mice became moribund and were euthanized. MHV-3 infection induces a fulminant hepatitis with hepatocellular necrosis, sinusoid thrombosis, and strong cytokine induction. USP18+/+ mice (C57BL/6) survived up to 10 days p.i., with a median survival of 8 days. the absence of USP18 confers an early antiviral advantage against MHV-3 infection. however, USP18/ mice ultimately succumbed to infection. MHV-3 infection does not induce type I IFN in mice. the decrease in MHV-3 replication and mortality following infection of USP18/ mice is not due to increased type I IFN or type I IFN signaling. we asked whether decreased MHV-3 replication and mortality were due to increased levels of ISGylation (21) first, we examined whether decreased proliferation of MHV-3 in USP18/ cells in vivo could be replicated in primary hepatocytes. MHV-3 viral titers in USP18/ hepatocytes are suppressed in the presence of increased ISGylation. this is similar to the extended survival seen in USP18/ mice as these mice ultimately succumb to MHV-3 infection. Ube1L is the unique activating enzyme of the ISG15/USP18 pathway. it forms an ATP-dependent thioester bond with ISG15 (11, 35) Ube1L knockdown in primary USP18+/+ murine hepatocytes decreased Ube1L protein and attenuated the increase in ISGylation. there is an observed decrease in ISGylation in USP18/ cells following MHV-3 infection. we then asked whether the MHV-3 PLP2 protein is the mechanism through which MHV-3 ultimately escapes the effect of host ISGylation. we treated MHV-3-infected cells with synthetic PLP inhibitors. viral titers were decreased in presence of PLP2 inhibitors in both USP18+/+ and USP18/ PEM. similar data were obtained for hepatocytes. these results suggest that MHV-3 proliferation and evasion from the cellular antiviral ISGylation milieu are dependent on PLP2 activity. study shows that ISGylation has antiviral activity in a model of severe coronavirus infection. the antiviral activity associated with ISGylation is dependent on conjugation of ISG15 to target proteins. cellular ISGylation is permissive against Sindbis virus (42) however, we have demonstrated that cellular ISGylation is necessary for the efficient replication of hepatitis C virus (25, 45) we expect that any IFN- produced upon exposure to MHV-3 would stimulate IFN- production in a positive feedback loop (53). however, we observed an almost complete absence of type I IFN production in response to MHV-3. lack of IFN production in USP18/ mice raises possibility of confounding immune effects. lack of IFN signaling thus allows us to attribute our results to ISGylation as opposed to IFN signaling in USP18/ mice. the nonspecific ISGylation of the nascent subset of each protein population present in the cell has been suggested to disrupt viral proliferation through a dominant negative effect. this is consistent with our finding that the effect of ISGylation blunts viral replication but does not abrogate it altogether. we have previously shown that increasing ubiquitination exerts an antiviral effect on coronavirus replication (28), and in this study we have shown that ISGylation exerts a similar effect. both DUB functions of PLP2 would favor MHV-3 replication although PLP2 has more affinity for ISGylated proteins than for ubiquitinated proteins."}
