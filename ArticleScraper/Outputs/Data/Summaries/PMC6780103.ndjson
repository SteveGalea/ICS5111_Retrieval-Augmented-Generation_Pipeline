{"summary": "adenoviruses are small, non-enveloped viruses with a linear, double-stranded DNA genome of approximately 36 kilobase pairs. the most severe adenovirus infections of the ocular surface are associated with HAdVs of species D (HAdV-D) [10], the species with the largest number of described viruses. the term \u201cocular surface\u201d broadly refers to the cornea and the conjunctiva. the conjunctiva is the mucus membrane that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the globe. it consists of an outer three to five cell layers thick epithelium thick epithelium of stratified squamous and columnar epithelial cells interspersed with goblet cells. it also contains blood vessels, lymphatic channels, and numerous immune cells, including T and dendritic cells. acute membranous keratoconjunctivitis and delayed-onset subepithelial corneal infiltrates are common clinical manifestations of epidemic keratoconjunctivitis (EKC) SEIs occur in approximately one-third of all EKC cases and may persist or recur for months to years following infection. expenses associated with medical visits and diagnostic testing are currently no specific antiviral therapies for adenovirus ocular infections. the elucidation of the immunopathogenesis of infection and its relationship with the virus replication cycle is crucial to the potential development of future immunomodulatory therapies. rapid trafficking adenoviruses replicate more efficiently, but may not stimulate host cytokine responses as effectively as a virus that enters and traffics more slowly. this review will focus broadly on the mechanisms of adenoviral entry and trafficking, the immune responses to adenovirus infection of the ocular surface. the binding of the RGD motif induces conformational changes in the integrins, which mediate downstream intracellular signaling to promote viral entry into the host cell. the fiber knob amino acids and the availability of the necessary cellular receptors and integrins determine the tropism of HAdVs for the ocular surface. HAdV-C2 and -5 entry studies have supported clathrin-mediated endocytosis. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the best elucidated route for viral entry, including for adenovirus [64,68,69,70,71] cells were washed with PBS, fixed in a fixative solution for 1 hour. cell pellet was further fixed for 1.5 hours in 2% aqueous OsO4. micrographs of infected tert-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells show HAdV-D37 can enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis. dynamin 2 is expressed in most cell types. it functions as a microtubule binding protein and as a negative regulator of microtubule stability. the binding of dynamin 2 to microtubules activates its GTPase function, resulting in endosome migration along the cytoskeletal network. dyamin 2 knockdown in corneal fibroblasts resulted in greater delivery of adenoviral DNA into cell nuclei. in parallel experiments, overexpression of dynamin 2 resulted in the opposite effects, including reduced nuclear entry of viral DNA. caveolin-Mediated Endocytosis Caveolae-dependent cell entry of adenovirus is controversial. HAdV-D37 enters human keratocytes in vitro using caveolae [42]. non-cornea tropic HAdV-C2 fails to infect keratocytes altogether. caveolin-rich endosomal fractions were found to contain higher levels of viral DNA compared to fractions rich in LAMP1. macropinocytosis is an endocytic process that begins with interactions between a ligand and its host cell receptors. these ruffles enclose the cargo, forming a large (>250 nm) vesicle known as a macropinosome near the plasma membrane, which then releases the cargo into the cytosol [112,113] if clathrin-mediated endocytosis is blocked, macropinocytosis becomes macropinocytosis of HAdV-B35 requires dynamin for entry into the parental HeLa-Kyoto clonal derivation, but not into the parental HeLa-ATCC cells or Wi-38 cells. macropinocytosis is regulated by p21-activated kinase (Pak), a serine/threonine kinase, and pretreatment with the Pak inhibitor IPA-3 reduced viral gene expression in clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the best elucidated route for viral entry, including for adenovirus [64,68,69,70,71]. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the best elucidated route for viral entry, including for adenovirus. tert-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells were infected with cesium chloride purified HAdV-D37 for 1 hour at room temperature. electron micrographs of infected tert-immortalized human corneal epithelial cells showed that HAdV-D37 can enter via clathrin-mediated endocytosis (i) or macropinocytosis (ii) caveolae (black arrows) associated with HAdV-D37 (white arrows indicate virus) factors beyond just the clathrin-coated pit are required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis. dynamin, a 100-kDa GTPase, plays a critical role in the fission of newly formed vesicles without which clathrin-mediated endocytosis does not occur. dynamin 2 knockdown in corneal fibroblasts resulted in increased microtubule acetylation, closer proximity of microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs) to cell nuclei. dynamin 2 knockdown in corneal fibroblasts resulted in greater delivery of adenoviral DNA into cell nuclei. caveolin-Mediated Endocytosis Caveolae-dependent cell entry of adenovirus is controversial. caveolin-1 and -2 are found in most cell types, while caveolin-3 is present only in myocytes. caveolae fuse with other caveolae to form larger structures called caveosomes. caveolae have been implicated in potential entry pathways for a variety of viruses. infected cells found multiple flask-shaped vesicles resembling caveolae and caveosome-like structures both contain HAdV-D37 virions. these virus-containing invaginations were also found to express caveolin-1 (Figure 3b) mice were found to accumulate virus on the cell membranes of corneal stromal cells and exhibit delayed viral entry compared to wild type mice. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the predominant entry pathway for HAdV-C2 and -5. if clathrin-mediated endocytosis is blocked, macropinocytosis becomes the primary entry mechanism. if clathrin knockdown is blocked, macropinocytosis becomes the primary entry pathway. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the dominant pathway in corneal epithelial cells, with macropinocytosis playing a secondary role. additional studies are needed to define molecular entry mechanisms of HAdV-D37 and other EKC-associated adenoviruses into ocular surface cells. the viral core particle binds to the nucleoporin Nup214 at the nucleus. this leads to kinesin-1 mediated disassembly and enabling the viral genome to enter the nucleus. all cells are capable, at least to some degree, of stimulating local innate immune and antiviral responses. HAdV-C5 was shown to move relatively quickly (within 1 hour of infection) from early endosomes to the cell nucleus. virions in late endosomes in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were associated with higher expression of IFN2, IL-1, IL-6, MIP-1, and TNF. the connection between entry, trafficking, and immune responses has not been specifically addressed in the cell types present on the ocular surface. the connection between entry, trafficking, and immune responses has not been specifically addressed in the cell types present on the ocular surface. adenovirus-infected corneal stroma is more than just a bystander or mere target of corneal inflammation. in vitro, cultured keratocytes resemble fibroblasts and have been shown to produce broad spectrum of cytokines. this is consistent with similar studies performed on corneal epithelial cells with human alphaherpesvirus 1. keratocytes are often more potent producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines than corneal epithelial cells. in vitro, adenoviral infected keratocytes express the pro-inflammatory chemokines IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, and MCP-1/CCL2. however, during natural infection of the eye, it has not yet been demonstrated if adenovirus is capable of reaching the corneal stroma. group D adenoviruses are internalized via Src-dependent, caveolin-mediated endocytosis. adenovirus stimulates cell surface TLR2 and endosomal TLR9. MyD88 activates Src, which then mediates multiple downstream kinases. p85 subunit of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activates AKT to drive translocation of NFB p65 to the nucleus. this pathway inhibits caspase 3/7-dependent apoptosis and promotes cell survival. it is not known if PI3K activation is dependent on FAK or is directly activated. inhibitors of cREL protein binding decrease cREL protein binding to MCP-1 promoters and reduce MCP-1 expression at 4 hours post-infection. IL-8 and MCP-1 are therefore mediated by two distinct pathways, explaining why MCP-1 expression occurs later in infection compared to IL-8 [181,182]. adenovirus is a chemoattractant for inflammatory monocytes. it is thought to be the chemokine responsible for the delayed migration of monocytes in the adenovirus infected cornea. keratocytes are also known to upregulate adhesion molecules following infection, including ICAM-1/CD54. it is not known why SEIs can persist and/or recur for months to years following infection. other PRRs, viral ligands, and cytokines are likely critical to corneal inflammation after adenoviral infection. mice showed reduced immune cell infiltration and reduced myeloperoxidase expression, if which is a correlate for neutrophil infiltration [209]. despite strong evidence for the role of corneal stromal cells in the pathogenesis of adenovirus keratitis in the mouse model, an understanding of their participation in adenovirus keratitis remains incomplete. conjunctiva appears to be more susceptible to adenovirus infection than the cornea. many adenoviruses cause conjunctivitis, while only a limited number cause keratitis. adenoviruses can infect and replicate in the cells of the human conjunctiva. HAdV-D37 replicates efficiently in the acinar epithelial cells of the lacrimal gland in vitro. it is now known that this cell line was established via HeLa contamination. a few studies have focused on the conjunctival immune responses to adenovirus infection. anti-microbial peptide (defensin)-like role for CXCL10 and CXCL11 was demonstrated against HAdV-B3 and HAdV-C5, but not against HAdV-D8 or HAdV-D64. it has been suggested that ocular-tropic adenovirus types have evolved immune evasion strategies to avoid host defensins. non-species adenoviruses, such as HAdV-C3, -E4 and -C5, were unable to induce these responses. this dampening of antiviral responses likely enables enhanced virus replication in the conjunctiva and, thus, subsequent spread to other ocular surface cells. conjunctival goblet cells are important for proper tissue homeostasis. HAdV-D19, which is not associated with EKC, was unable to cleave MUC16. this suggests specific HAdV-D types have evolved in capacity to penetrate the mucin layer to infect the eye. few studies have examined the cytokine responses of corneal epithelial cells to ocular adenoviruses. one study showed that IL-1 secreted by HAdV-D37 infected epithelial cells can enhance ICAM-1 expression on endothelial cells to promote lymphocyte entry into the infected cornea. this is consistent with similar studies performed on corneal epithelial cells with human alphaherpesvirus 1. adenoviral infected keratocytes express pro-inflammatory chemokines IL-6, IL-8/CXCL8, and MCP-1/CCL2, which promote subsequent immune cell infiltration to the cornea. however, during natural infection of the eye, it has not yet been demonstrated if adenovirus is capable of reaching the corneal stroma. adenoviruses are internalized via Src-dependent, caveolin-mediated endocytosis. adenovirus stimulates cell surface TLR2 and endosomal TLR9. MyD88 synergistically activates Src, which then mediates multiple downstream kinases. Src is a central signaling molecule in keratocytes in response to adenovirus infection. it appears to be phosphorylated within minutes of infection by at least two mechanisms. downstream signaling via IRAK1/4 and TRAF6 can also lead to the activation of the same downstream signaling pathways and pro-inflammatory responses. kinase phosphorylates the p38 MAPK kinase, leading to p65/p50 translocation and IL-8 expression within 1 hour post-infection. inhibitors of JNK decrease cREL protein binding to MCP-1 promoters and reduce MCP-1 expression at 4 hours post-infection. corneal epithelial cell-derived interleukin-1 alpha (IL-1) promotes the expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 on endothelial cells following infection. this allows for transendothelial leukocyte migration and recruitment to the infected cornea. keratitis does not require active viral replication. HAdV-D37 viral DNA played only a minor role in innate immune responses. it implicated capsid penton base RGD in the onset of clinical keratitis. adenovirus does not replicate in the mouse cornea, further supporting the notion that intact virus is not required for inflammation. limbus and corneal periphery contain mature and immature Langerhans cells. these resident cells stimulate the recruitment of systemic innate (neutrophil, macrophage, and natural killer cells) and adaptive (T-cells) immune responses to the eye [201,203,204,205,206,207]. corneal epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to different stimuli. cytokine responses of corneal epithelial cells to ocular adenoviruses. cytokine induction failed to identify elevation of commonly studied cytokines. keratocytes are the major cell population of the stroma. in vitro, cultured keratocytes resemble fibroblasts. keratocytes are often more potent producers of pro-inflammatory cytokines than corneal epithelial cells. work from our laboratory has defined the signaling pathways by which these cytokines are stimulated in keratocytes. the PRRs TLR2 and TLR9 were shown to mediate cytokine responses to adenoviruses. MyD88 activates Src, which then mediates multiple downstream kinases, leading to NFB activation. this culminates in the inhibition of apoptosis and expression of pro-inflammatory genes. similar signaling pathway in human corneal epithelial cells has yet to be elucidated. PI3K activation induces expression of IL-8 and MCP-1 by activating mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs), including p38, JNK, and ERK1/2. this results in translocation of the p65 and p50 subunits of NFB to the nucleus. inhibitors of JNK decrease cREL protein binding to promoters and reduce MCP-1 expression at 4 hours post-infection. IL-8 is a well-described and highly potent neutrophil chemoattractant. its expression in the adenovirus infected cornea closely correlates to the rapid infiltration of neutrophils. heparin sulfate is a reservoir of chemoattractant for subsequent leukocyte infiltration. keratitis does not appear to require active viral replication. UV-inactivated virus was found to be sufficient to induce keratitis. heat denatured capsid was unable to induce keratitis. transcriptome sequencing of non-ocular cell types infected with different adenovirus types has defined robust changes in innate immune responses. these included the TLR signaling, cell cycle progression, apoptotic, RNA binding and processing, and NFB signaling pathways. it is not known if other cell types present on the ocular surface respond to adenovirus infection in similar fashion. mice showed reduced immune cell infiltration and reduced myeloperoxidase expression, the latter if which is a correlate for neutrophil infiltration. despite strong evidence for the role of corneal stromal cells in the pathogenesis of adenovirus keratitis in the mouse model, an understanding of their participation in adenovirus keratitis remains incomplete. junctiva appears to be more susceptible to adenovirus infection than the cornea. conjunctivitis typically precedes keratitis. ocular-tropic adenoviruses can infect and replicate in the cells of the human conjunctiva. the infection of conjunctival epithelial cells with adenovirus initiates signaling that would be expected to drive the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells to the site of infection. this suggests that the infection of conjunctival epithelial cells with adenovirus initiates signaling that would be expected to drive the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, NK cells respond rapidly to viral infection by killing virus infected cells. cytokines promote crosstalk between dendritic cells and T cells. NK cells are replaced by CD56Bright, immature NK cells. ocular surface mucins have complex O- and N-glycans with sialyated cores. sialic acid residues on the GD1 ganglioside are one of the primary receptors for cornea-tropic HAdV-Ds. the potential for sialic acids present in the normal tear film has not been evaluated to our knowledge. ocular-tropic adenoviruses can infect and replicate in the cells of the human conjunctiva. HAdV-C5 is able to infect and replicate in the acinar epithelial cells of the lacrimal gland, possibly contributing to its detection in the tear film. epithelial cells with low multiplicities of infection of HAdV-C5 resulted in upregulation of CXCL2, CXCL5, CXCL10, CXCL11, and several interferon induced signaling molecules. this suggests that the infection of conjunctival epithelial cells with adenovirus initiates signaling that would be expected to drive the recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes/macrophages, T cells, NK cells, and the number of conjunctival lymphocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, and monocytes increases significantly during the acute phase of the infection. NK cells respond rapidly to viral infection by killing virus infected cells and producing cytokines which promote crosstalk between dendritic cells and T cells. NK cells are replaced by CD56Bright, immature NK cells. mucins are high molecular weight, heavily glycosylated proteins. ocular surface mucins have complex O- and N-glycans with sialyated cores. sialic acid residues on the GD1 ganglioside are one of primary receptors for cornea-tropic HAdV-Ds. lococcus aureus infection, conjunctival goblet cells produce both mucins and IL-1, the latter of which is dependent on the NLRP3 inflammasome. adenoviruses enter host cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis, uncoat within endosomes, and rapidly traffic to the nucleus for subsequent replication. differential entry of adenoviruses to ocular surface cells dictates immune responses. the entry mechanisms of ocular-tropic HAdVs would need to be defined across a multitude of cell types. it will be important to determine whether ocular-tropic HAdVs can productively replicate."}
