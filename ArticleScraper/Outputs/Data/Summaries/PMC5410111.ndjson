{"summary": "infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious respiratory disease of chickens. the virus belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is composed of an enveloped virion encapsulating a 27.6 kb positive-sense ssRNA genome. the genome encodes four structural proteins, 15 non-structural proteins. studies of purified coronavirus and related nidovirus virions have shown that nsps such as the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase nsp12 are associated with the virus particle. there is relatively little crossover between the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) proteome and host proteins that are upregulated during infection. IBV Beau-R was grown in the allantoic membrane of 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. Virus or 1 BES medium (mock) was inoculated into the allantoic cavity. the embryos were sacrificed and the allantoic fluid harvested. the low number of proteins identified in uninfected eggs showed the proteome of allantoic fluid is dominated by a few key proteins. allantoic fluid (100 g protein) from 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were analysed by SDS-PAGE using 4\u201320 % Tris/glycine/SDS gels. a total of 354 proteins were detected in uninfected and mock-infected allantoic fluid. 420 proteins were detected in mock-infected allantoic fluid. lists of proteins identified in each sample were analysed using the panther classification system. the list of proteins present in each sample was then compared with each other. the presence of IBV proteins in purified virions and mock samples was analysed by Western blotting using an anti-IBV antibody. no bands were seen in the purified mock sample by Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE. the total number of proteins identified in each preparation was 399, 289 and 273, respectively. the list of 35 host proteins in common between the three experiments was submitted to PANTHER.db to determine the biological functions and process that these proteins belonged to. ribosomal protein S17 5, 6, 2 P09206 Tubulin 3 chain 14, 3, 2 P09244 Tubulin 7 chain 16, 8, 3 P09652 Tubulin 4 chain 11, 1, 1 P09654 VIM Vimentin 6, 32, 12 P0C1H5 H2B-VII Histone H2B 7 12, 2, 2 P0CB50 PRDX1 Peroxiredoxin-1 3, 16, 9 P11501 HSP90AA1 Heat-shock protein HSP FP1 EIF4A2 Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-II 4, 15, 5 Q90705 EEF2 Elongation factor 2 5, 41, 10 Q90835 EEF1A Elongation factor 11 8, 44, 18 Q98953 S100A6 Protein S100-A6 4, 3, 3 * Proteins previously reported to be associated with the IBV virion by Kong et al. (2010). analysis of IBV-infected allantoic fluid IBV Beau-R was grown in the allantoic membrane of 10-day-old specific-pathogen-free, Rhode Island Red embryonated chicken eggs. Virus or 1 BES medium (mock) was inoculated into the allantoic cavity and grown for 24 h, before the embryos were sacrificed. allantoic fluid (100 g protein) from 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs were analysed by SDS-PAGE using 4\u201320 % Tris/glycine/SDS gels. proteins identified in the proteomes of uninfected and mock-infected allantoic fluid were analysed by the panther classification system (Mi et al., 2013) lists of proteins identified in each sample were analysed using the panther classification system (Mi et al., 2013) to identify classes of protein function. the lists of proteins present in each sample were then compared with each other to generate a Venn diagram (Fig. 1b) the majority of the overall protein classes identified were shared between both uninfected and mock-infected allantoic fluid. no bands were seen in the purified mock sample by Coomassie blue-stained SDS-PAGE (data not shown) the presence of IBV proteins in purified virions and mock samples was analysed by Western blotting using an anti-IBV antibody. total number of proteins identified in each biological replicate was 399, 289 and 273, respectively. list of 35 host proteins in common between the three experiments was submitted to PANTHER.db to determine the biological functions and process that these proteins belonged to. somal protein S17 5, 6, 2 P09206 Tubulin 3 chain 14, 3, 2 P09244 Tubulin 7 chain 16, 8, 3 P09652 Tubulin 4 chain 11, 1, 1 P09654 VIM Vimentin 6, 32, 12 P0C1H5 H2B-VII Histone H2B 7 12, 2, 2 P0CB50 PRDX1 Peroxiredoxin-1 3, 16, 9 P11501 HSP90AA1 Heat-shock protein HSP 90 13, 11, proteins identified in association with the IBV virion described in Table 1 were analysed by panther (Mi et al., 2013) to identify classes of protein function, using the default settings. preparations 2 and 3 showed more similarity to one another in the proteins identified. 35 host proteins were observed to be repeatedly associated with egg-grown IBV Beau-R virions. three viral proteins were also detected; S, M and N. growth of IBV in embryonated eggs is an established technique to produce large quantities of high-titre virus. three viral proteins could be identified that were associated with the IBV virion. none of these proteins was found in the purified IBV preparation. this was further evidenced by the lack of proteins present in mock-infected preparations of allantoic fluid. the number of groups that were represented in all three preparations was much smaller than the number of groups present in the individual preparations. some of the proteins identified were subunits of whole proteins, resulting in reduced overlap between individual preparations. the host proteins identified could be split into 17 functional groups. annexin A2, destrin, S100 proteins and T-complex protein 1 are known to interact with cytoskeletal proteins. ribosomal subunits of the 60S ribosome are associated with the virion. coV double-membrane vesicles were not found in those of IBV. other interesting proteins have not been reported previously in association with other nidovirus virions. allantoic fluid was oculated with IBV into the allantoic cavity. at 24 h, eggs were sacrificed by refrigeration and allantoic fluid was harvested. purified IBV virions were negatively stained using methylamine vanadate. analysis of purified virus was mixed with sample buffer and heated. no proteins were found to be present in the sample. trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) was reconstituted in 50 mM acetic acid to a concentration of 0.2 g l. samples were digested by the addition of 10 l trypsin to the sample. peptide mixtures were analysed by online nanoflow liquid chromatography. analysis of purified IBV was performed on three biological replicates. peaks were picked by the software using default settings. spectra were exported for peptide identification using Mascot version 2.3. Viruses and cells IBV Beau-R was propagated in 10-day-old, specific-pathogen-free Rhode Island Red chicken eggs. eggs were sacrificed by refrigeration and allantoic fluid was harvested. purifications of mock-infected allantoic fluid from eggs inoculated with 1 BES IBV growth medium were performed in the same way. however, unlike IBV-infected fluid there was no cloudy white band present. analysis of purified virus by electron microscopy. samples were reduced by the addition of DTT to a final concentration of 3 mM and heating at 60 \u00b0C for 10 min. samples were digested by the addition of 10 l trypsin to the sample, followed by incubation at 37 \u00b0C overnight. the top 20 most intense ions from the MS1 scan (full MS) were selected for tandem MS by collision-induced dissociation. all product spectra were acquired in the LTQ ion trap. the MS proteomics data have been deposited in the ProteomeXchange Consortium (Vizcano et al., 2014) via the PRIDE partner repository."}
