{"summary": "most cases reported outside the Arabian Peninsula have a direct or indirect link to the Arabian Peninsula. cases reported outside the Arabian Peninsula have been reported to have a direct or indirect link to the Arabian Peninsula, mostly through recent travel. the annual mortalities associated with MERS-CoV are lower than many other viruses that induce acute viral infections, e.g., seasonal influenza, 250000 to 500000 deaths[4]; rotavirus, 453000 child deaths[5]; measles, 145700 deaths[4]; rabies, 55000 deaths[6]; yellow fever virus, 30000 deaths (mostly in Africa)[4]; dengue fever virus, 25000 deaths (mostly in Africa)[7 the ancestral virus strain may have been experienced mutations during this long period, which have rendered it able to cross the species barrier. it is not clear whether the currently circulating virus strains have acquired additional mutations which have rendered them able to be easily transmissible from human to human. in the Arabian Peninsula, Eastern Africa and Asia, are needed to explore the exact morbidity rate of MERS-CoV. major genetic differences have not yet been recorded among human cases. elucidation of the genetic diversity of MERS-CoV strains from camels should be undertaken as a matter of urgency."}
