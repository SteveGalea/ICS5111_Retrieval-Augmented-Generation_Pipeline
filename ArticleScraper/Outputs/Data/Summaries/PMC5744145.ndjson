{"summary": "a set of 15 HPV \u201chigh-risk\u201d types are associated with cervical, anogenital, and oropharyngeal cancers. a successful HPV infection requires that the viral genome be transported from an extracellular encapsidated state (i.e., viral particles) to a free unencapsidated state within the host cell nucleus. L2 is thought to be physically complexed to the vDNA within viral particles. it is responsible for the intracellular transport and nuclear accumulation of the vDNA during infection. the structural nature of the L2/vDNA complex within the actual virion remains poorly understood. virion binding to extracellular heparin sulfate proteoglycans induces conformational changes in both the L1 and L2 capsid proteins of the viral particle. endocytosis of the virion occurs through an actin-dependent process with similarities to macropinocytosis. retromer binding is important for EE to LE/MVB transport. cleavage occurs in a furin-, cyclophilin- -sec-, and pH-dependent manner. cleavage occurs C-terminal to the final arginine residue of a conserved consensus site. RG-1 epitope exposure was initially believed to be a convenient marker for furin cleavage. cyclophilins were believed to control furin accessibility and susceptibility to furin. but recent work disfavors this idea, as furin cleavage still occurs despite PPI inhibition of RG-1 exposure. a fraction of the L1 capsid, in form of conformationally intact pentamers, accompanies the complex to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) the complex then traffics to the trans-Golgi network (TGN) in a retromer-dependent manner [23,47,48], where it resides until the onset of mitosis [49,50,51]. retrograde trafficking of L2/vDNA to more distal compartments has not been well established. retromer and Sorting Factors The retromer is a trimer of Vps26, Vps29, and Vps35. retromer is a cytosolic sorting adaptor complex that binds to peptide motifs. SNX17-L2 interaction likely promotes retention/recycling of the L2/vDNA complex within the endosomal compartment. SNX17 uses its FERM domain to bind to cargo harboring the NPxY motif. SNX27 does not interact with L2 through the conserved NPxY motif. SNX17 and SNX27 have been implicated in retrograde trafficking through the retromer [59,63] the retriever consists of three subunits-DSCR3, C16orf62, and Vps29, a subunit in common with the retromer [64], suggesting a role for this novel pathway in HPV infection. sensitivity to -sec inhibition was the most conserved feature among the 29 alpha and 5 beta HPV types tested. inhibition of -sec activity results in a failure of L2/vDNA to reach the TGN in the absence of -sec activity. -sec inhibition has no effect on post-TGN trafficking of vDNA. pathway used by HPV involves retromer and SNXs. the catalytic PS1/2 subunit of -sec are known to modulate protein trafficking, lysosomal maturation, and Ca2+ homeostasis independently of -sec-activity. but direct connections to retrograde trafficking pathways are scant. translocation\u2014L2/vDNA exits vesicular compartments, passing across the limiting membrane to establish infection within the cell nucleus. a conserved \u201cmembrane destabilizing peptide\u201d near the C-terminus of L2 was identified as having a role in the endosomal escape of L2. the Sapp laboratory has demonstrated that L2 uses this TMD to span intracellular vesicular membranes with residues C-terminal of the TMD being cytosolic. additional data from the Sapp laboratory suggest the vDNA remains lumenal within these intracellular vesicles. the nature of any cleavage-induced conformational changes will remain elusive. if structural data on L2 is obtained, the nature of any cleavage-induced conformational changes will remain elusive. the TMD itself may play a role in the initial insertion of L2 into membranes. -sec activity could be required for L2 to initially insert into membranes to achieve membrane protrusion. failure to insert and protrude through the membrane would be expected to block TGN localization, and may instead cause trafficking away from EEA1 positive early endosomes into a degradative lysosomal pathway. if L2 is not a substrate for -sec then how does -sec catalysis affect trafficking so drastically\" endosomal protein stannin restricts HPV infection by rerouting virions away from the TGN to degradative compartments. stannin appears to block association of L2 with retromer to prevent retrograde trafficking of L2/vDNA. this is in contrast to retromer knockdown or mutation of retromer binding sites in EEA1-positive endosomal compartments. this is contrary to other non-enveloped viruses, like reoviruses and adeno-associated viruses, which depend on these endosomal proteases for uncoating [97,98]. this is contrary to other non-enveloped viruses, like reoviruses and adeno-associated viruses. vDNA-containing vesicles migrate along microtubules, clustering around the centrioles during progression from G2/M to prometaphase. these vesicles eventually make their way to the condensed chromosomes. infection of both daughter cells is favored at an MOI > 2. the Sapp laboratory concluded that vDNA became cytosolic sometime during G1 after mitosis. in this model, L2/vDNA would reside within these unique mitotic transport vesicles, bound to chromosomes for an extended period of time. in this model, vDNA became cytosolic sometime during G1. biotinylation of GFP-BAP could result from cytosolic exposure of just the C-terminus of L2. the earliest biotinylated signal was detected at or just before mitosis. this timing of L2/vDNA translocation would be consistent with the visual \u201cjump\u201d of vDNA from a punctate pericentriolar distribution in prometaphase to being chromosome-bound by metaphase. interaction between L2 and mitotic chromatin is indirect, requiring a prometaphase-specific factor, or that L2 is post-translationally modified during prometaphase to somehow activate its chromatin binding ability. the striking correlation between the ability of L2 to bind chromatin and to translocate during infection supports a model where translocation of L2/vDNA out of the mitotic vesicles occurs. immunofluorescence staining with mAbs specific for L2 epitopes flanking the TMD suggest a type-I topology for L2 protrusion. the N-terminal 45 residues are lumenal, a 25 residue TMD, and the C-terminal 400 residues are cytosolic. translocation studies with PsV encapsidating the L2-BirA fusion are suggestive of a different topology for L2 both models are consistent with published L2 immunofluorescence and trypsin susceptibility data. the N-terminus remains lumenal with all 400 residues downstream of the TMD being cytosolic to recruit sorting factors. L2-BirA would not be expected to biotinylate substrate as observed. PML bodies are small nuclear structures, organized by the PML protein for which they are named. these dynamic domains are present in most cells, and are assembled and remodeled in response to a variety of cellular stresses. the PML protein, which has many different isoforms, is critical to the assembly of PML bodies and recruitment of host proteins to these foci. SUMOylation and SUMO-SIM networks are believed to be important to PML assembly and dynamics. PML bodies have been shown to be important for efficient infection from reporter-expressing HPV16 pseudoviruses, as well as authentic BPV virions. ectopically expressed L2 can localize to PML bodies, remodeling them through recruitment of Daxx and depletion of Sp100. PML bodies show increased dynamics and disperse into the cytosol during open mitosis. only after exit from mitosis and reformation of the nuclear envelope are PML bodies assembled de novo. if the L2/vDNA complex is targeted to newly formed PML bodies in early G1 remains to be determined. the visual association of vDNA with mitotic chromosomes represents full translocation of L2/vDNA across limiting membranes, or simply vDNA-filled post-Golgi vesicles bound to chromosomes. more work is needed to identify the nature of the post-Golgi vesicles in which L2 resides upon entry into mitosis. the precise role of virion-derived L2 in the remodeling of PML bodies, establishment of infection, initial viral gene expression, and potential immunoevasion represent exciting avenues of future endeavors."}
