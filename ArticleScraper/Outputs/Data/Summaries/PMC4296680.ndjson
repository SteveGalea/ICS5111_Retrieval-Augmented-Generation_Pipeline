{"summary": "the advent of electronic health records and the development of automated methods for encoding and classifying electronic narrative data offer an opportunity to identify potentially better methods. a random sample of MUHC patients will be used to develop the automated detection algorithms (cohort 1, development set) the most accurate algorithms will then be applied to a second random sample of MUHC patients (cohort 1, validation set), and their accuracy will be assessed using a reference standard assessment of the medical chart."}
