{"summary": "a number of reports have implied a direct role of RNAi in regulating viral infections in mammalian cells. mutations in components of RNAi machinery enhanced replication of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), influenza virus, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in mammalian cells. human viruses encode suppressor proteins or RNAs that block or modulate the RNAi pathway. the best-studied mammalian VSRs are Ebola virus VP35, VP30, and VP40 proteins. a few functional motifs, such as double-stranded-RNA (dsRNA)-binding properties, have been demonstrated for some VSRs. the vast majority of mammalian viral proteins have not been assessed for potential RNA silencing suppressor (RSS) activities. dengue virus (DV) is the causative agent of dengue fever, the most prevalent arthropod-borne viral illness in humans, with 50 to 100 million individuals infected annually worldwide. NS4B is one of the DV proteins with RNAi suppression activity. this activity is independent of the interferon (IFN) inhibition functions of NS4B. NS4B protein failed to bind dsRNA but interfered with dicing activity. primers 2k-ns4b forward (5\u2032-GAA ATG GAA TTA ACA CCC CAA GAT AAC CAA TTG-3\u2032) and 2k-ns4b reverse (5\u2032-GTC GAC TCT TCT TGT GTT-3\u2032) NS4B sequences from the remaining serotypes of dengue virus were amplified by using the primers listed in Table 1. ns4b gene was amplified by using primers ns4b forward (5\u2032-GGA TCC GGA AAC GAG ATG GGT-3\u2032) and ns4b reverse (5\u2032-GAG CTC TCT TCT TGT-3\u2032) and cloned into plant binary vector pBI121. cloned fragments mobilized into mammalian expression vector pCDNA 3.1+. RNA was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol. lysed in TRIzol (invitrogen, NY, USA) for RNA isolation. the unique reads were matched to miRBase v19 and mapped to known human miRNAs. sequences that perfectly matched the reported human miRNA sequences were considered for subsequent analysis. alanine scan mutants were constructed using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) PCR was performed on the wild-type (wt) ns4b gene cloned into a pIB-V5/His-TOPO vector using primer pairs with the corresponding mutation. 104A TCA CAA GTC AAC GCC ATA ACT CTC ACA (For) TGT GAG AGT TAT GGC GTT GCT TGA (Rev) T108I CCC ATA ACT CTC ATA GCA GCT CTT TTC (For) GAA AAG AGC TGC TAT GGG (Rev) T108A CCC ATA ACT CTC ATA ACT CTC ATA ACT CTC ATA GCA GCT the cells were transfected with 1 g each of the pSIREN-RetroQ, pSIREN-RetroQ-shRNA gfp, and pSIREN-RetroQ-shRNA gfp vectors. the cells were transfected with 1 g each of the pSIREN-RetroQ, pSIREN-RetroQ-shRNA gfp, and pSIREN-Retro the cells were allowed to transiently express NS4B and/or its deletion as well as substitution mutants. the cells were allowed to transiently express NS4B and/or its deletion as well as substitution mutants. plasmids encoding wt NS4B, 2K-NS4B, and domain BC/NS4B were transfected with poly(IC) (20 g/ml) the cells were lysed 7 h after the poly(IC) treatment. the protein was localized in inclusion bodies, which were isolated. the substrate, gfp dsRNA, was prepared by using the Riboprobe Combination System-SP6/T7 RNA polymerase. at the end of the reaction, the substrate was subjected to RNase-free DNase I digestion and purified on an Illustra MicroSpin G-25 column. gfp probe was labeled with [-32P]ATP by 5\u2032-end labeling. membrane was washed three times in 6 SSC (1 SSC is 0.15 M NaCl plus 0.015 M sodium citrate) and once in 6 SSC with 0.2% SDS at 42\u00b0C. dsRNA was digested into siRNA (22 bp) by recombinant human Dicer. ed with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin G sodium, and 100 g/ml streptomycin sulfate and nonessential amino acids at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. DV2 (P23085 INDI-60) was obtained from the National Institute of Virology, Pune, India. to express NS4B in the leaves of Nicotiana xanthi, the ns4b gene was amplified by using primers ns4b forward (5\u2032-GGA TCC GGA AAC GAG ATG GGT-3\u2032) and ns4b reverse (5\u2032-GAG CTC TCT TCT TCT TGT GGT TGT-3\u2032) the cloned fragments were mobilized into the plant binary vector pBI121. the knockdown studies were performed by transfecting 10 nM siRNA duplex Huh 7 cells by using a reverse transfection protocol with Lipofectamine 2000. the virus was diluted in DMEM containing 2% FBS, and cells were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C on a rocker. total RNA of the uninfected and infected cells was extracted by using TRIzol according to the manufacturer's protocol. the PCR products of the library were considered and sequenced by using a parallel sequencing technology. PCR was performed on the wild-type (wt) ns4b gene cloned into a pIB-V5/His-TOPO vector using the QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit. PCR was performed using primer pairs with the corresponding mutation. oligonucleotides used for site-directed mutagenesis are shown in Table 3. the PCR mixture was treated with DpnI enzyme to remove methylated parental DNA prior to transformation into Escherichia coli XL1B cells. the plasmid from each colony was isolated and sequenced to confirm the incorporation of the desired mutation. the line was transfected with 1 g of plasmid pIB-V5/His-TOPO. after 4 h, the serum-free medium was replaced with serum-containing medium. NS4B was transiently expressed by agroinfiltrating a recombinant pBI121 vector harboring the ns4B gene into plant tissues of N. xanthi. HEK293T cells were seeded into 12-well plates in modified Eagle's medium. the cells were transfected with 1 g each of the pSIREN-RetroQ, pSIREN-RetroQ-shRNA gfp, and pSIREN-RetroQ-shRNA gfp vectors with NS4B/pCDNA3.1+ or NS4B deletion/substitution mutants. analysis was performed by using Cellquest software (Becton, Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) all experiments involving quantification of GFP-fluorescing cells by FACS analysis were carried out three times. the results were determined by the use of Student's t test. protein was lubilized in 50 mM 3-(cyclohexylamino)-1-propanesulfonic acid (CAPS) buffer (pH 11.0) containing 1.5% N-lauryl sarcosine and 0.3 M NaCl for 30 min. protein was separated by centrifugation (10,000 g for 30 min) the binding buffer contained 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 1.5 mM MgCl2 and 4% glycerol in a final volume of 30 l. the RNA-protein complex was resolved on a 6% acrylamide nondenaturing gel (prerun for 1 h at 4\u00b0C) in 1 Tris-borate-ED dsRNA of 900 bp of the GFP gene was transcribed in vitro by using the Riboprobe Combination System-SP6/T7 RNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) dsRNA was digested into siRNA (22 bp) by recombinant human Dicer (Genlantis) either in the absence or in the presence of decreasing amounts of recombinant protein NS4B, F112A we further assessed the effect of DV infection on the host RNAi pathway by measuring the mRNA levels of these components in DV-infected cells. this suggests a negative regulation of RNAi machinery by DV infection. these data support the notion that downregulation of RNAi factors helps dengue virus multiplication. RNAi machinery modulates dengue virus replication in mammalian cells. the pattern may be conserved among flaviviruses. miRNAs have been shown to play an important role(s) in cellular development, metabolism, and proliferation. hsa-miR-125a-5p, hsa-miR-148a-3p, and hsa-miR-375 performed stem-loop qRT analysis. similar reductions in miRNA levels were observed compared to changes in miRNA profile upon dengue virus infection. NS4B was selected based on its previously demonstrated role in alpha/beta interferon signaling inhibition (22, 23, 35) to assess the RNAi suppressor function of NS4B, we used a previously established Sf21 RNAi sensor line (experimental line 1) that was used to screen RNAi suppression properties of FHVB2 (16) this cell line is particularly useful in discriminating between the interferon response and the RNAi pathway. the bicistronic vector Retro-Q was cotransfected with either a plasmid containing NS4B (pCDNA-NS4B) or the empty vector alone. no such reversal was observed when only the empty control plasmid without any suppressor gene was used. the empty vector was used as a mock control, while FHVB2 was used as a positive control in the assay. the tested NS4B protein showed positive reversal of silencing. recombinant NS4B F112A proteins run on 12% SDS-PAGE gels. purified dsRNA could be a mixture of dsRNAs of various sizes. average size of diced siRNAs was 22 bp. NS4B proteins of all serotypes showed similar RNAi suppressor activities. we compared the RNAi suppressor activities of NS4B and 2K-NS4B in the HEK293T sensor line. 2K-NS4B in HEK293T cells represented on the x axis. percentage of cells expressing GFP represented on the y axis. data shown in panels B and D are means standard deviation from three independent experiments. deletion of the extreme C-terminal region (aa 191 to 248) of NS4B slightly affected its RNAi suppressor activity. together, the results of the deletion mutant analysis showed that the TMD3 and TMD5 regions of NS4B are required for the RNAi suppressor activity. the domain for the interferon response is distinct from that for the RNAi suppression activity of NS4B. the results from a previous study (38) and the present study together suggest that the F112A substitution in the TMD3 region affects RNAi suppressor activity as well as viral replication. pTMD refers to the predicted transmembrane domain. luciferase expression was induced by poly(IC) as a positive control. transfection with 2K-NS4B resulted in a small but consistent reduction in the luciferase expression level. the luciferase gene was expressed from a spliced transcript. the relative luciferase expression level corrected for the internal Renilla control (firefly/Renilla) is shown. NS4B does not bind dsRNA. many VSRs have been shown to cause RNAi suppression. the level of expression of the mutant NS4B protein was similar to that of the wt NS4B protein. in vitro processing of long dsRNA substrates by dicer in the presence of recombinant NS4B F112A proteins with increasing concentrations. however, this processing was inhibited by NS4B in a dose-dependent manner (lanes 5 to 8). qRT-PCR of the corresponding mRNAs in transfected cells. a 6-fold increase in DV genomic RNA levels was observed in the cases of Drosha, Ago1 and Ago2 knockdowns. a nearly 2-fold increase was seen in the case of Dicer at 48 h postinfection. the # symbols indicate a statistically significant difference in terms of the P value. similar results were observed in the case of west Nile virus (WNV) replication upon siRNA knockdown of RNAi components. a few of the downregulated miRNAs are displayed in Fig. 2Ai to iv. these results were once again confirmed by stem-loop qRT-PCR analysis. similar reductions in miRNA levels were observed compared to changes in the miRNA profile upon dengue virus infection. dengue virus NS4B is a viral RNAi suppressor protein. plants have been shown to suppress the RNAi/miRNA pathway by producing virus-encoded RNAi suppressor proteins. NS4B was selected based on its previously demonstrated role in alpha/beta interferon signaling inhibition. b gene into plant binary vector pBI121 carried out reversal of silencing. infiltrated leaves showed a good amount of reversal of GFP activity at 8 days postinfiltration. empty control vector failed to show such a reversal. bar graph representation of the FACS results for NS4B in HEK293T cells. percentage of cells expressing GFP represented on the y axis. data shown in panels A, C, and D are means standard deviation. NS4B inhibits the processing of shRNA/dsRNA into siRNAs in vivo and in vitro. hek293T cells transfected for a GFP reversion assay and Northern blot analysis of GFP siRNAs in transfected cell lines (HEK293T) Western analysis for expression check of NS4B and its F112A mutant in reversal-of-silencing assays in HEK293T cells. four serotypes of DV (DV1 to DV4) have been identified so far. NS4B proteins of all serotypes showed similar RNAi suppressor activities. bar graph representation of the FACS results for different deletion mutants of NS4B in HEK293T cells, represented on the x axis. bar graph representation of the FACS results for different deletion mutants of NS4B in HEK293T cells. deletion mutant B, consisting of the TMD3 and TMD4 regions, and deletion mutant C, consisting of the TMD5 region, showed RNAi suppressor activities similar to those of wild-type NS4B. this observation is noteworthy, as the N-terminal region (aa 191 to 248) of NS4B slightly affected its RNAi suppressor activity. acid change of F112A caused a significant reduction (40%) of RNAi suppressor activity of NS4B, while a change of F112L did not. the other four substitution mutations, P104L/A and T108I/A, did not change the RNAi suppression activities of NS4B significantly. a firefly luciferase expression plasmid was transfected with a spliced transcript. the luciferase gene was expressed from a spliced transcript. transfection with 2K-NS4B resulted in a small but consistent reduction in luciferase expression level. NS4B does not bind dsRNA. many VSRs have been shown to cause RNAi suppression by binding to dsRNA/siRNA. NS4B inhibits Dicer processing of dsRNA into siRNA. in order to explore other mechanism of RNAi suppression mediated by NS4B, we performed Northern analysis for gfp siRNA in GFP reversion assays with expression of either NS4B or its F112A mutant. the level of expression of the mutant NS4B protein was similar to that of the wt NS4B protein (not shown) plant RNAi was shown to act as a systemic antiviral defense against cytoplasmic RNA and nuclear DNA viruses. as in plants, the defense function of the RNAi pathway was also shown in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. a number of studies of mammalian cells have advocated the possible role of RNAi pathways against animal viruses. similar results were previously observed in the cases of equine encephalitis virus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza virus (46\u201348). a number of studies have reported the role of RNAi machinery in the replication of flaviviruses, especially dengue virus, in insect cells (30, 31, 37) NS4B was selected because it inhibits alpha/beta interferon signaling. a number of recent reports suggest a link between the IFN response and RNAi machinery in regulating viral replication in mammalian cells. the NS4B deletion mutants retaining pTMD3 and -5 reversed RNA silencing to a level similar to that shown by wild-type NS4B. this observation is significant because the NS4B anti-IFN function is mediated by the pTMD1 and -2 regions of NS4B (35). two substitution mutations, P104L and F112L, attenuated the growth of wild-type dengue virus serotype 1 in vero cells in a previous study, did not have a substantial effect on the RNAi suppressor activity of NS4B. however, a substitution mutation, F112L, resulted in a considerable loss of RNAi suppression activity. this results are consistent with previous findings that suggested that NS4B contributes to the adaptation of DV NS4B suppresses RNAi by interfering with dicer activity. it is possible that NS4B might interact with another host RNAi factor(s) and inhibit biochemical activities of the factor."}
