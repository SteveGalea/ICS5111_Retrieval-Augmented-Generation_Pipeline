{"summary": "there were 425 million diabetes mellitus patients in 2017 worldwide. that number is expected to increase to 629 million by 2045.1. abnormally high blood glucose caused by insulin insufficiency or insensitivity can lead to severe complications. it has been observed that DPP-4 inhibitors can exert a similar efficacy in reducing blood glucose levels without severe adverse effects such as hypoglycemia as compared with sulfonylurea. however, various adverse side effects associated with the current DPP-4 inhibitor can still be observed that, in turn, can severely limit their practical application. al.12 Sodium/glucose transporter inhibitors Dapagliflozin, Canagliflozin, Empagliflozin Reduce urine glucose re-absorption Urinary and genital tract infection Lupsa et al.13 Overview of DPP-4 DPP-4 and its biological function. sDPP-4 stimulates inflammation in smooth muscles from blood vessel through activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)/ERK/NF-B signaling pathway, increasing proinflammatory cytokine release and finally stimulating smooth muscle cell proliferation. however, sDPP-4-induced smooth muscle inflammation is not always good to the body. sDPP-4 inhibition can improve success rate of transplantation after analyzing relationship between sDPP-4 activity and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. the known substrates include numerous homeostatic hormones such as GLP-1, NPY, glucagon, peptide Y, and secretin, which accurately regulate blood sugar homeostasis. serum sDPP-4 activity can be an indicator of physiological or immunological stages. rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis patients have lower serum sDPP-4 activity than healthy people. sDPP-4 activity can be associated with the progress of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. mDPP-4 plays a positive role in asthma progress through promoting T-cell activation. mDPP-4 acts on both endothelial and epithelial cells in regulation of blood vessel function. mDPP-4 has been considered a potent target in treatment of transplantation and autoimmune disease. Xu et al. have pointed out that mDPP-4 inhibition can reverse diastolic left ventricular dysfunction via inhibiting mDPP-4/SDF-1 related angiogenesis. mDPP-4 inhibition can reverse diastolic left ventricular dysfunction via inhibiting mDPP-4/SDF-1 related angiogenesis. high serum sDPP-4 levels can be referred to elevated glycation end products. high serum sDPP-4 levels also indicate worse drug response to DPP-4 inhibitor and hyperglycemia. secreted sDPP-4 acts as myokine, which stimulates inflammation in smooth muscles from blood vessel through activating protease-activated receptor 2 (PAR2)/ERK/NF-B signaling pathway. sDPP-4 may cause microvascular endothelial dysfunction, which is the cause of chronic kidney disease in elders, through the same signaling with smooth muscle inflammation. the role of sDPP-4 in chemotaxis regulation is related to the degradation of chemokine. sDPP-4 inhibition can improve success rate of transplantation after analyzing the relationship between sDPP-4 activity and hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. sDPP-4 is essential for maintaining immune activity and chemotaxis. serum activity of sDPP-4 can be an indicator of physiological or immunological stages. rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis patients have lower serum sDPP-4 activity than healthy people,47,48. the pathological correlation between sDPP-4 activity and MPM prognosis is still veiled. the pathological correlation between sDPP-4 activity and MPM prognosis is still veiled. mDPP-4 levels are 11-fold higher in psoriatic skin than normal skin. mDPP-4 plays a positive role in asthma progress through promoting T-cell activation. mDPP-4 acts on both endothelial and epithelial cells in regulation of blood vessel function. mDPP-4 inhibition can reverse diastolic left ventricular dysfunction. sitagliptin was adopted to treat slowly progressive type 1 DM (SPTIDDM) and latent autoimmune diabetes adult (LADA). high serum sDPP-4 levels also indicate worse drug response to DPP-4 inhibitor and hyperglycemia, which are the indicators of poor glycemic control and advanced disease progress. Deng et al.88 docked a series of synthesized triazole-based uracil derivatives into the linagliptin-DDP4 co-complex structure using the standard precision (SP) Glide (Schr\u00f6dinger, Inc.) to dock synthesized pyrazolo inhibitors into the quinazolinone-DDP4 co-complex structure (PDB code: 2ONC) the corresponding amino acids of the DDP4 substrate peptide designated by P1, P\u20191, P2, P\u20192, etc. from the nearest to the farthest cleavage point can bind as shown in Figure 1,92 and S2. the corresponding amino acids of the DDP4 substrate peptide designated by P1, P\u20191, P2, P\u20192, etc. from the nearest to the farthest cleavage point can bind as shown in Figure 1,92 and S2. molecular dynamics (MD) can be used to address the flexibility of DDP4 as illustrated by the study of Liu et al.98. however, the lengthy MD calculation will substantially increase computational time and expense, making it impractical to be carried out in a high-throughput fashion. gly-pro-p-nitroanilide will be released from peptides and the amount is determined by optical absorption at 405 nm at noninhibition state. the minimum changes within direct enzymatic assay cannot be directly translated into the actual bioactivity in cells and animals. the results of cell-based assay can be an authentic representative of the realistic situation mainly due to the fact that they do not consider in vivo pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic factors. however, direct action upon target cells can be very helpful in detailing intracellular dynamics prior to clinical or animal tests. autoimmune animal model becomes a platform for testing in vivo efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors in long-term administration. the most predominant subclasses of DPP-4 inhibitors are terpenoids, peptides, phenolics, and flavonoids. these findings have implicated that alkaloids are not suitable as DPP-4 inhibitors or their applications in DDP4 inhibition have not been well explored. natural DPP-4 inhibitors from different origins compared with clinical medicines. vivo investigations to confirm therapeutic values compared with clinical medicines. iana Enzymatic Lin et al.138 (\u2013)-Vitisin B Syringic Acid 4-O--D-Glucopyranosyl-(15)--L-Rhamnopyranoside, Eight phenolic glycosides, Two phenolic acids Magnolia officinalis Enzymatic Yan et al.139 Sterol Stigmasterol Fagonia cretica Enzymatic Saleem et al.140 Terpenoids 16-hydroxycle the role of DPP-4 inhibition in cancer treatment is inconclusive. but it is certain that DPP-4 inhibition in tumorigenesis and progression should be considered. the development of hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and celiac disease are inversely correlated with DPP4 levels. flammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a general term for Crohn\u2019s disease and ulcerative colitis. it is caused by opportunistic infection or immune cell infiltration. flammatory bowel disease (IBD) is caused by opportunistic infection.
