{"summary": "bacterial infections are the most common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations. if serum inflammatory markers can differentiate bacterial from virus infection in patients with COPD exacerbation requiring emergency department visits. viral infections have been detected in up to 78% of patients with COPD exacerbations. bacteria are considered the major cause of COPD exacerbations. the link of viral infections to COPD has been mentioned in recent studies. all the patients were current smokers or ex-smokers with a smoking history of greater than 20 pack-years. postbronchodilator spirometry prior to the ED visit that demonstrated a ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV1) to forced vital capacity (FVC) of 70% was documented. patients with a history of bronchial asthma or with abnormal chest radiographs indicating other respiratory diseases were excluded. a positive bacterial culture was defined as moderate to heavy growth of bacteria in the semiquantitative culture. oropharyngeal swab specimens were inoculated onto MK2, MRC-5, and MDCK cells to isolate the viruses. the cells were incubated at 35\u00b0C for 2 weeks. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using the SPSS (SPSS 18 for Windows, SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) statistical package and Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA) Differences between subgroups were compared by using the 2 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test when the expected number of events was less than 5. Ethics This study was conducted in accordance with the amended Declaration of Helsinki. prior corticosteroid use was defined as having had a corticosteroid prescribed at 10 mg or more of prednisolone per day for more than 30 days within 1 year before the ED visit. anthonisen criteria were defined as the presence of one of three symptoms, including increased dyspnea, increased sputum volume and increased sputum purulence. the RT-PCR mixture used in the assay was the SuperScript\u00ae III One-Step RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen; Life Technologies Corp, Carlsbad, CA, USA) each reaction contained the following kit reagents: 0.2 M probe, 0.4 M primer, 12.5 L of 2 ABI Master mixture (containing 0.4 mmol/L of each deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate [dNTP] and 2.4 mmol/L MgSO the mean FEV1 was 0.860.32 L (40.12%15.70% of predicted value) baseline characteristics of 72 COPD patients, including age, sex, BMI, FEV1% predicted, FVC% predicted, GOLD stage, pack-years of tobacco use, previous inhaled or oral medications, peripheral blood WBC counts, and serum CRP and PCT levels. n (%) 14 (19.44) oral antibiotics, n (%) 7 (9.7) Oral methylxanthines, n (%) 52 (72.22) Anthonisen criteria 2, n (%) 52 (72.22) WBC, 109/L 10.524.19 CRP, mg/mL 0.20120.4315 Abbreviations: BMI, body mass index; COPD, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CRP, C-reactive protein; FEV1, a larger proportion of the virus-positive patients had been previously treated with oral corticosteroids than had the virus-negative patients. the viral-positive groups presented with more sore throat symptoms than did the viral-negative groups (62.5% versus 33.9%) (P=0.04) sputum culture of one patient grew Staphylococcus aureus and Acinetobacter baumannii. no patients were positive for mycoplasma by PCR. no statistically significant differences between bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative patients. the results indicated that an increased sputum volume during the COPD exacerbation was independently associated with a higher risk of a recurrent exacerbation during the subsequent year. the percentage of patients free from readmission to the EDs in 1 year was not significantly different between the bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups. bacterial infections were confirmed in 41.7% of patients with COPD exacerbations requiring ED visits. the most commonly identified virus was PIV3 and the most commonly found bacterium was H. influenzae. the positive rates of viral identification in patients with COPD exacerbations requiring hospitalization varied in different publications. in a recent systematic review, the rates of detection of viruses associated with COPD exacerbations were highest in Europe. biomarkers are commonly used to differentiate infective or noninfective causes of COPD exacerbations. biomarkers are commonly used to differentiate infective or noninfective causes of COPD exacerbations. in a retrospective cohort study, up to 85% of patients hospitalized for COPD exacerbations were treated with antibiotics. there was no difference in sputum purulence between bacteria-positive and bacteria-negative groups. ation was the only independent risk factor for recurrent exacerbations in the subsequent 1-year period. the techniques used in this study cannot distinguish acute infection from colonization. this study was conducted in a 3,300-bed tertiary teaching hospital."}
