{"summary": "malaria is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in tropical and subtropical countries. malaria is caused by the hematoprotozoan parasite of the genus Plasmodium with five different species (i.e., P. falciparum, P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, and P. knowlesi) infecting humans. the pathogenesis of malaria is complex and multigenic. MBL interacts with MBL-associated serine proteases (MASP-1, -2, and -3 and Map19) and activates the membrane attack complex or complement-mediated phagocytosis (9, 11, 13) and regulates the release of proinflammatory cytokines (14). alleles have been designated as O haplotype, whereas the normal MBL2 allele has been designated as A haplotype. these six SNPs (L/H, X/Y, P/Q, MBL2*D, MBL2*B, and MBL2*C) form eight common \u201csecretor haplotypes\u201d (8, 25, 32) these secretor haplotypes regulate the serum levels of functional MBL molecule. 434 ethnically matched case-control samples included asymptomatic individuals (n = 157, mean age of 29.7 19.62 years, and a male/female ratio of 2:65), mild malaria (n = 101, mean age of 30.24 15.71 years, and a male/female ratio of 67:34), and patients with severe malaria (n = 176, mean age of 26.13 12.32 years, and a male/female ratio of 103:73 malaria is defined by a parasitemia of 1,000 to 50,000/l on admission, no schizontemia, circulating leukocytes containing malarial pigment at 50/l, nonhomozygous for hemoglobin S, hemoglobin level at >80 g/liter, platelets at >50/nl, leukocytes at 12/nl, lactate at 3 mmol/liter, and blood glucose at >50 mg/dl. artesunate (2.4 mg/kg of body weight) was the main antimalarial treatment given intravenously. all mild malaria cases recovered with treatment uneventfully. all samples were checked for the HbS phenotype. thermal cycling parameters consisted of an initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 45 s at 93\u00b0C, 25 s at 66\u00b0C, and 9 min at 68\u00b0C. only the upstream promoter and first exonic regions (1.4 kb) were resequenced for population samples. variances were identified by assembling DNA sequences with the reference sequence using AutoAssembler software (Applied Biosystems) variances were validated and reconfirmed in a subset of samples by resequencing and visual confirmation of electropherograms. risk estimates of severe and mild malaria were derived by comparison to the asymptomatic control group. patient samples were collected from 32 socially, linguistically, and geographically diverse endogamous populations of India. the samples were clinically characterized according to WHO 2010 guidelines (41) and as described previously (42, 43). mild malaria is defined by a parasitemia of 1,000 to 50,000/l on admission, no schizontemia, circulating leukocytes containing malarial pigment at 50/l, nonhomozygous for hemoglobin S, hemoglobin level at >80 g/liter, platelets at >50/nl, lactate at 3 mmol/liter, and blood glucose at >50 mg/dl. the asymptomatic control samples were collected from the same region where malaria is b CM, cerebral malaria; ARF, acute renal failure; IVH, intravascular hemolysis. ethical committees approved the study. genome sequencing was isolated from whole blood according to a previously described protocol. only the upstream promoter and first exonic regions (1.4 kb) were resequenced for population samples. exo-SAP-treated amplicons were sequenced directly by using a BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit. the data were analyzed using intercooled Stata v9.1 and the level of significance was set to a P value of 0.05. the allele and genotype frequencies were analyzed by simple allele/genotype counting and an expectation-maximum algorithm.

YO/YO, XA/XA, and XA/YA were significantly low in frequency in the group with mild malaria (P = 0.033) compared to asymptomatic individuals. the reconstructed MBL2 secretor haplotype distributions were corrected for multiple comparisons by Bonferroni's method. we observed that the low-serum MBL2 haplotype MBL2*LXPA was significantly more frequent in the group with mild malaria compared to the asymptomatic group (P = 0.0045) 2*LXPA 68 (21.65) 70 (34.65) 106 (30.11) 1.9 (0.3\u20132.9) 0.0045 1.56 (1.1\u20132.2) 0.042 NS MBL2*LYPB 18 (5.73) 9 (4.45) 32 (9.09) NA NS NA MBL2*HYPD 4 (1.27) 2 (0.99) 8 (2.27) NA NA High vs low High 210 (66.88) 119 (58.91) 175 (49.71) the frequency of allele 221X was significantly higher in patients with severe malaria compared to the asymptomatic control (after multiple corrections) the heterozygous genotype GA (MBL2*AB) was observed significantly at high levels (P = 0.03) compared to asymptomatic controls (Table 2). the secretor haplotypes that lead to a high level of functional MBL (HYPA + LYQA + LYPA + HYQA) made up one group, and those that lead to a low level (LXPA + LYPB + LYQC + HYPD + HYQC + LXPB + LYQB) made up another. the high-MBL-producing haplotypes were significantly less frequent (P = 0.00002) in the group with severe malaria compared type MBL2*LYPA was lower in cases of severe malaria than in mild-malaria group (P = 0.02) this suggests that the exon1 structural variant that affects the oligomerization increases the risk of severe malaria. we extended our study to 830 individuals from 32 socially, linguistically, and geographically diverse endogamous populations of India. b 550C>G 221G>C +4C>T MBL2*D MBL2*B MBL2*C CC/CG/GG GG/CG/CC CC/CT/TT CC/CT/TT CC/CT/TT GG/AG/AA GG/AG/AA 1 Thapa Caste Tibeto-Burman Nepal Nepal 32 12:18:02 16:16:00 15:14:03 31:01:00 24:08:00 30:0 Munda Tribe Austro-Asiatic Jharkhand CI 30 15:13:02 12:15:03 15:13:02 30:00:00 24:06:00 28:02:00 11 Santhal Tribe Austro-Asiatic Jharkhand CI 41 23:15:03 17:17:07 20:14:07 41:00:00 33:08:00 37:04:00 12 Rajgond Tribe Indo-European Madhya Pradesh CI 26 5:14 ATP Tibeto-Burman Nagaland NE 19 3:12:04 12:06:01 17:02:00 19:00:00 15:04:00 19:00:00 15:04:00 19:00:00 15:04:00 19:00:00 15:04:00 19:00:00 15:04:00 19:00:00 15:04:00 19:00:00 20 Nagaseema Tribe Tibeto-Burman Nagaland NE 24 7:12:05 12:10 andamanese ATP Andaman Andaman Andaman 13 1:02:10 6:05:02 13:00:00 11:02:00 13:00:00 13:00:00 Total 830 a AP, Andhra Pradesh; CI, central India; NI, north India; NE, northeast India; WI, west India; WB, west Bengal. b Genotype distributions were in HW equilibrium at 0.05 level. BL2 allele is designated as A. DISCUSSION Mannose-binding lectin (MBL) is a soluble innate immune pathogen recognition protein that plays a vital role in defense during the early phase of infection. the clinical significance of MBL2 variants varies with the disease context in different world populations (21, 47\u201349) the low-serum-MBL genotype is a risk factor for malarial infection (5, 9, 32, 51); however, a study performed in Gambia failed to replicate this association. the genotype YA/YA was significantly less common in mild-malaria cases compared to asymptomatic subjects. haplotypes MBL2*HYQA, MBL2*HYQC, MBL2*LXPB, and MBL2*HXPA have also been reported in Bakola Pygmy and Moroccan Berber populations. compared with structural variants, we did not observe any other variations that were statistically significant between the severe- and mild-malaria groups. the MBL2*D/B/C (>20%) and MBL2*Y (>75%) variants were observed at higher frequencies in lambadi, Rajgond, Birhor, Subba, Sherpa, Bhootia, and Puma populations. we investigated whether MBL2 functional variants can modulate or alter serum MBL levels."}
