{"summary": "rotavirus is one of the leading pathogens that cause severe gastroenteritis. there is widespread interest in using natural products as antiviral agents. licorice derived from Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract exerted antiviral properties against several viruses. group A rotaviruses (RVAs) are the leading cause of gastroenteritis, malnutrition, and diarrhea in young children and animals. in humans, RVAs are estimated to cause 453,000 deaths per year in children under 5 years of age, mostly in developing countries. compounds found in human milk and soy infant formulation were isoflavones. genistin and mixtures of isoflavones can inhibit rotavirus infection by modulating virus attachment and post-binding step. high levels of antiviral activity were found to be related with mucin found in the human milk [12] polyphenol compounds from the roots of Glycyrrhiza uralensis exert in vitro anti-RVA activity by inhibiting both viral absorption and viral replication. however, there is little evidence whether this compound inhibits RVA infection in the animal models. piglets treated with 400 mg/ml GUE showed decreased fecal consistency score at DPI 7 and diarrhea was cured at DPI 8 or 9 (Figure 1). the piglets treated with 400 mg/ml GUE showed decreased fecal consistency score. the mock-inoculated group showed long and slender villi with short crypts of the small intestine. virus-inoculated piglets had marked villi atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. piglets receiving 400 mg/ml of GUE showed gradual improvement of lesion changes. 0.08*** 1.54 0.02*** 1.50 0.05*** a The intestinal changes are scored according to the average villi/crypt (V/C) ratio plus the grade of epithelial cell desquamation. asterisk indicate significant differences (*p0.05;*** p0.001) compared to the positive control. Piglet treated with 200 mg/ml GUE shows moderate improvement of lesion changes in the duodenum (G), jejunum (H) and ileum (L) m-O Piglet shows markedly restored villi and crypt in the duodenum (M), jejunum (N) and ileum (O) the piglets treated with GUE alone showed the basal levels of p38, JNK, and NF-kB expression in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and splenocytes. the normal or mock-inoculated and GUE-treated groups (100-400 mg/ml) showed the basal levels of p38, JNK, and NF-kB expression in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and mock-treated piglets after RVA diarrhea had higher mRNA levels of IL8, IL10, IFN-, IFN-, and TNF-, compared to normal piglets. however, the mock-treated piglets had higher mRNA levels of IL8, IL10, IFN-, IFN-, and TNF-, compared to the normal piglets. all piglets treated with 100 mg/ml and 200 mg/ml GUE showed diarrhea at day post-inoculation (DPI) 2. diarrhea persisted to the termination of the experiment. the piglets treated with 400 mg/ml GUE showed decreased fecal consistency score at DPI 7. piglets given 100 mg/ml or 200 mg/ml of GUE showed gradual improvement of lesion changes (Figure 3M-O) the mock-inoculated group showed long and slender villi with short crypts of the small intestine. virus-inoculated piglets had marked villi atrophy and crypt hyperplasia. 91 0.01*** 2.83 0.01 2.77 0.03* Virus-inoculated + 400 mg GUE treated 1.58 0.08*** 1.54 0.02*** 1.50 0.05*** a The intestinal changes are scored according to the average villi/crypt (V/C) ratio plus the grade of epithelial cell desquamation. Piglet treated with 100 mg/ml GUE exhibits slight improvement of lesion changes in the duodenum (G), jejunum (H) and ileum (I) piglet treated with 200 mg/ml GUE shows markedly restored villi and crypt in the duodenum (M), jejunum (N) and ileum (L) piglets treated with GUE alone showed basal levels of p38, JNK, and NF-B expression in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and splenocytes. a significant linear effect of GUE in reducing the mRNA expression of p38, JNK, and NF-kB was observed. mock-treated piglets after RVA diarrhea had higher mRNA levels of IL8, IL10, IFN-, IFN-, and TNF- compared to the normal piglets. however, the mock-treated piglets had higher mRNA levels of IL8, IL10, IFN-, IFN-, and TNF- compared to the normal piglets. a number of studies have been conducted using neonatal pig model in studying vaccines, passive antibody (Ab) treatments and development of immune response to rotavirus infection. colostrums-deprived piglets obtained from sows by hysterectomy and maintained in isolator units were used as a RVA animal model. polyphenol compounds isolated from the roots of G. uralensis had inhibitory effects of RVA activities in cultured cells. this inhibity activity may result in marked reduction of virus excretions from the infected cells into small intestinal lumen. rotavirus strains down-regulate NFB activity through the functions of nonstructural protein NSP1. inflammatory responses, which are the most important host defense mechanism against pathogens, can be detrimental and are often more harmful to the hosts than the inciting pathogens. glycyrrhizin and other compounds in the GUE may exert anti-inflammatory effects in animal models. anti-oxidants had been already found to interfere with virus-induced pro-inflammatory gene expression. the anti-inflammatory and antiviral effects of GUE can be attributed to the interaction of the different active components of GUE. piglets were fed every 6 hours with a diet consisting of sterilized milk. piglets were negative for rotavirus antibodies prior to RVA exposure. each group contained three piglets. three mock-inoculated groups were treated four times daily with 100 mg/ml, 200 mg/ml, or 400 mg/ml of GUE for 7 days. at 5 days of age, three groups were mock-inoculated and mock-treated. a starting volume of 200 l of centrifuged 10% fecal suspensions was used for RNA extraction by an AccuPrep\u00ae Viral RNA Extraction Kit. sample collection All piglets were immediately necropsied after euthanasia or death. a one-step real-time RT-PCR assay based on SYBR Green detection was carried out to quantify the RNA of RVA in the fecal samples. the reaction mixture was composed of 5 l RNA, 12.5 l SensiMix one-step mixture, 1 l each of 0.5 M forward and reverse primer, 0.5 l of 50SYBR Green solution, 0.5 l of RNase inhibitor (final concentration: 10 units), 0.5 l of mRNA expression levels of p38, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor-kappa B (NFkB), interleukin (IL)8, IL10, interferon-beta (IFN-), IFN- and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-) in spleen, duodenum, jejunum, and ileum Sample preparation of spleen and each part of small five L real-time PCR reactions were carried out using SensiMix one-step RT-PCR with SYBR Green (Quantace, London, UK) the relative gene expression was assessed by 2-2-Ct, where Ct = Ct of target genes (NF-B, IL8, IFN-, TNF-) - Ct of internal control gene (-actin) 100 mg/ml, 200 mg/ml, and 400 mg/ml were made by diluting the stock. piglets were fed every 6 hours with a diet consisting of sterilized milk. each group contained three piglets. piglets were mock-inoculated and mock-treated four times daily. the antiviral effects of GUE were evaluated on the basis of diarrhea score, histopathological lesions in the small intestines, quantitation of fecal virus shedding, and expressions of different transcription factors and cytokines. each part of small and large intestines was sampled and fixed with 10% buffered formalin solution. histological evaluation was performed on coded samples. a comparison was made with sections from mock-inoculated and mock-treated controls. total RNA extracted from each fecal sample was processed using a Corbett Research Rotor-Gene Real-Time Amplification System (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Australia) the reaction mixture was composed of 5 l RNA, 12.5 l SensiMix one-step mixture, 1 l each of 0.5 M forward and reverse primer, 0.5 l of 50SYBR Green solution, 0.5 l of RNase inhibitor (final concentration: 10 units), 0.5 l of Mg mRNA expression levels of p38, JNK, NFB, IL8, IL10, IFN-, IFN- and TNF- were quantified by real-time PCR assay using Rota-gene 6000\u00ae (Corbett Research, Sydney, NSW, Australia) qPCR conditions were performed as described elsewhere [38,39] Statistical analysis The data gathered from this experiment were written as mean standard deviation (SD) to compare between groups, means of the different parameters were analyzed for variance."}
