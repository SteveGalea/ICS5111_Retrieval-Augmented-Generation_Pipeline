{"summary": "LSECs are first in contact with portal-delivered antigens and thus act as a sieving barrier in expressing highly efficient sentinel and scavenger functions. they also tightly control blood-parenchyma exchanges via a dynamic regulation of the sinusoidal blood flow in releasing vasoactive factors such as NO. LSECs play a major role in liver tolerance in displaying a restricted Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated activation profile to hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections are serious health problems affecting over 350 million and 170 million people worldwide. most liver damage in HBV/HCV infections is attributed to an exuberant immunopathological response triggered by viral infection rather than direct injury caused by viral replication. evidence suggests that an exacerbated hepatic inflammatory response during acute infection may predispose to the development of a fulminant he MHV3 infects LSECs, hepatocytes, Kupffer cells (KCs) and Ito cells. all of which express the carcinoembryonic antigen 1a (CEACAM1a) viral receptor. LSECs play an important role in the resistance of A/J mice to MHV3 infection by controlling viral replication. the absence of vascular thrombosis combined with efficient recruitment of mononuclear cells favors hepatic clearance of YAC-MHV3 and full recovery of infected mice within 15 days (32) these improved clinical outcomes in mice infected by the attenuated variants support the hypothesis that preservation of the structural and functional integrity of LSECs may be one determining factor in the severity of hepatitis. MHV3 is a cloned pathogenic substrain isolated from the livers of infected DBA2 mice. MHV3 induces a rapid mortality in C57BL/6 mice within 3 to 4 days postinfection (p.i.) this variant induces a delayed mortality (5 to 9 days p.i.) HBSS\u201310 nM HEPES (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was excised, injected several times with digestion buffer. the cell suspension was passed through sterile 70-m and 40-m nylon mesh filters successively. LSECs were then purified using the positive-selection phycoerythrin (PE kit) histopathological analysis of liver was done by hematoxylin-eosin-safranin staining. immunolocalization of IL-33 and caveolin-1 (CAV-1) was performed on liver sections fixed in paraformaldehyde. LSECs were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 7.5 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. cells were then infected with infectious MHV3, YAC-MHV3 or 51.6-MHV3 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and incubated at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2 for 24 to 72 h depending on RNA from in vitro-infected LSECs was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA II kit (Macherey-Nagel, Bethlehem, PA) one microgram of RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Ambion, Austin, TX) real-time PCR amplification was carried out on 25 ng cDNA using the hotStart-IT green qPCR master mix HPRT 5\u2032-GAAAGACTTGCTCGAGATGTCATG-3\u2032 IL-6 5\u2032-TCGGAGGCTTAATTACACATGTTC-3\u2032 IL-33 5\u2032-GCTGCGTCTGTTGACACATTG-3\u2032 IL-33 5\u2032-GCTGCGTCTGTTGACACATTG-3\u2032 IL-33 5\u2032-GCTGCGTCTGTTGACACATTG-3\u2032. the liver suspension was kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 rpm. levels of nitric oxide (NO) were quantified using the Griess reagent assay. inflammatory cells were enriched using 35% Percoll gradient (Sigma-Aldrich) red blood cells were lysed with a Tris-buffered ammonium chloride solution. one million (106) leukocytes were incubated with anti-CD16/32 antibodies. in vitro studies were performed with Student's t test comparing uninfected (control) to virus-infected cells or virulent to attenuated MHV3 infections. multiple-group analyses were conducted for in vivo studies. cloned substrain produced in persistently infected YAC-1 cells. variant causes no mortality and induces efficient recruitment of innate immune cells. all viruses were passaged fewer than three times onto L2 cells. LSEC purity was analyzed by cytometry before each experiment. groups of 6 or 7 wild-type (WT) C57BL/6 or TLR2 KO mice were intraperitoneally (i.p.) infected with 103 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of MHV3, 51.6-MHV3, or YAC-MHV3. secondary horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated rabbit anti-goat antibody (Dako, Markham, Ontario, Canada) or OmniMap anti-rabbit\u2013HRP (RUO) for 16 min. double-immunofluorescence stainings of IL-10 or IL-33 and CAV-1 were conducted on liver cryosections fixed in paraformaldehyde. LSECs were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 7.5 105 cells/ml in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) and antibiotics. cell culture supernatants were collected for enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. total RNA was extracted for quantitative reverse transcription-PCR analysis. amplification was carried out using the hotStart-IT SYBR green qPCR master mix (USB Corporation, Cleveland, OH) on an ABI 7300 system (Applied Biosystems) the primer sets used are listed in Table 1. Threshold cycle values were collected and used for CT analysis. the liver suspension was kept on ice for 30 min and centrifugated. the suspension was kept on ice for 30 min and centrifugated. determination of IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) in liver lysates and/or LSEC culture supernatants was carried out by ELISAs. levels of nitric oxide (NO) were quantified using the Griess reagent assay. myeloid cells, gated by high side scatter, were assessed for CD11b and Gr1 to enumerate macrophages (CD11b+ Gr1inter) and neutrophils (CD11b+ Gr1high) lymphocytes were further gated to allow determination of CD4+ and CD8+ subpopulations. hepatitis induced by parental virulent MHV3 strain 24, 31. we first aimed to compare evolution of damage, inflammatory infiltrates, and viral replication in the livers of mice infected by virulent and attenuated MHV3 strains. infection with 51.6-MHV3 revealed delayed occurrence of inflammatory foci at 48 h p.i. with barely detectable hepatic damage. 6 C57BL/6 mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1,000 TCID50 of MHV3, 51.6-MHV3, or YAC-MHV3. inflammatory and necrotic foci are indicated by arrows. arrows indicate occurrence of necrotic and inflammatory foci in livers. a direct association between capillarization (lack of fenestrations) of LSECs in livers from HCV-infected patients and overexpression of caveolin-1 (CAV-1), a key component of LSEC fenestrations, was recently reported (34). mRNA levels for CAV-1 and Fgl2 in livers from all infected groups of mice were also localized by immunohistochemical staining. mRNA expression for caveolin-1 (A), Fgl2 (C), and IL-33 (D) genes was evaluated by qRT-PCR. levels of production of IL-33 at 72 h p.i. in the liver of each mouse were quantified. mRNA expression, production, and localization of IL-33 increased only in the livers of MHV3-infected mice. expression of IL-33 was induced only in the liver of MHV3-infected mice. expression of IL-33 was induced only in the liver of MHV3-infected mice. Virulent MHV3 infection leads to an imbalance of pro- over anti-inflammatory mediators in the liver. dysfunction of LSECs in MHV3-infected mice may favor the induction of a proinflammatory state in the liver. infected mice were induced in the parenchyma and in venous and sinusoidal ECs. occurrence and intensity of IL-10 staining were weaker in MHV3-infected mice. groups of 5 or 6 mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1,000 TCID50 of MHV3, 51.6-MHV3 and YAC-MHV3-infected mice. values represent fold change in gene expression relative to that in mock-infected mice. production levels of CXCL1 (B), CCL2 (D) and CXCL10 (F) at 72 h p.i. in the liver of each mouse were quantified by ELISA. the kinetics of surface TLR2 and -4, endosomal TLR3 and -7, and helicase RIG-1 and MDA-5 gene expression in the livers of infected mice were compared by qRT-PCR from 24 to 72 h p.i. expression levels of the TLR3, TLR4, RIG-1, and MDA-5 genes were increased equally or more during MHV3 infection than during 51.6- or YAC-MHV3 infection. values represent fold change in gene expression relative to that in mock-infected mice. higher levels of inflammatory mediators in the livers of MHV3-infected mice may be associated with preferential and higher induction of PRRs, especially TLR2. macrophages (CD11b+ Gr1int), B cells (CD19+), and T cells (CD8+ and CD4+) were analyzed by cytofluorometry. percentages of NK-T cells transiently decreased in the livers of MHV3-infected mice. NK cell percentages increased more in MHV3- than in 51.6- and YAC-MHV3-infected mice. intrahepatic mononuclear cells were isolated from groups of 5 or 6 mock-infected or MHV3-, 51.6-MHV3-, or YAC-MHV3-infected C57BL/6 mice at 24 and 48 h p.i. percentages of NK-T cells (NK1.1+ CD3+) (A), NK cells (NK1.1+ CD3) (B), neutrophils (Gr1hi CD11bhi) NK-T cells decreased only in the livers of MHV3-infected mice. total NK cells were not altered in all infected groups. number of neutrophils increased at 24 h p.i. in MHV3-infected mice. 87 to 91% of isolated cells expressed endothelial markers CD146, CD54 (ICAM-1), and CD31 (PECAM-1) but not the macrophage marker F4/80. LSECs were characterized by cell lysis and rounded cells instead of typical MHV-induced giant syncytial cells. viral replication as well as CPE were monitored from 24 to 120 h p.i. LSECs were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with MHV3, 51.6-MHV3 and YAC-MHV3. the evolution of cytopathic effects in LSEC cultures was noted up to 5 days p.i. (B) all experiments were conducted in triplicate. LSECs were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with MHV3, 51.6-MHV3, and YAC-MHV3. RNA and supernatant from LSECs infected with each viral strain were collected at 24, 48, or 72 h p.i. IL-33 (A), Fgl2 (C), and caveolin-1 (E) fold changes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. MHV3-infected mice showed a higher inflammatory response in the liver than mice infected by attenuated strains. mRNA expression and production levels of anti-inflammatory (IL-10 and TGF-) and proinflammatory (IL-6 and TNF-) cytokines produced by infected LSECs were determined. IL-10 levels increased rapidly or progressively higher in 51.6-MHV3- and YAC-MHV3-infected LSECs than in MHV3-infected LSECs up to 72 h p.i. (P 0.05 to 0.001) TGF- expression, however, was not induced or was slightly induced in cells infected by the attenuated strains (P 0.05 and 0.01) production levels of IL-10 (B), TGF- (D), IL-6 (F) and TNF- (H) in supernatants were quantified by ELISA at 24 h p.i. production levels of IL-10 (B), TGF- (D), IL-6 (F) and TNF- (H) in supernatants were quantified by qRT-PCR. IL-6 mRNA expression reached higher levels in cells infected by virulent MHV3 than in those infected by attenuated strains only at 24 h p.i. (P 0.05 to 0.001) LSECs were also reported to secrete chemokines upon infection by dengue virus and to enhance their production in chronic inflammatory liver disease. we first sought to determine whether MHV3 increased TLR2 expression on LSECs. levels of TLR2 mRNAs were significantly higher in cells infected by MHV3 than in those infected by attenuated strains at 24 h p.i. RNA from infected LSECs was extracted and mRNA expression levels for the TLR2 gene were determined by qRT-PCR. mRNA expression levels of MHV nucleoprotein (MHV-N) (B), IL-6 (C) and CXCL1 (D) were determined by qRT-PCR. histopathological analysis of the liver revealed fewer and smaller necrotic foci in MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice than in WT mice. comparable and barely detectable hepatic damage was noted in TLR2 KO and WT mice infected with 51.6-MHV3. TLR2 activation by virulent MHV3 decreases IL-10 and increases inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression. hepatic levels of IL-6 and TNF- were reduced in MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice in comparison to C57BL/6 mice. this suggests a role for TLR2 in MHV3-induced release of inflammatory factors. a double immunohistochemistry staining of IL-10 and CAV-1 on liver sections revealed expression of IL-10 in ECs was effectively higher in livers from MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice. expression of IL-10 in ECs was effectively higher in livers from MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice than in those from WT mice. livers were fected with 1,000 TCID50 of MHV3 or 51.6-MHV3. mRNA fold changes for several genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. values represent fold change in gene expression relative to that in mock-infected mice after normalization to HPRT expression. we first aimed to compare the evolution of damage, inflammatory infiltrates, and viral replication in the livers of mice infected by virulent MHV3 strains. virulent MHV3-infected mice were i.p. infected with either MHV3 or attenuated viruses for 24 to 72 h. blood and liver samples were collected for clinical, histopathology, and viral titer analyses. group of 5 or 6 mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1,000 TCID50 of MHV3, 51.6-MHV3, or YAC-MHV3. arrows indicate necrotic and inflammatory foci in livers from infected mice at 24, 48, and 72 h p.i. a prothrombinase expressed by LSECs correlated with MHV3-induced fulminant hepatitis. a direct association between capillarization (lack of fenestrations) of LSECs in livers from HCV-infected patients and overexpression of caveolin-1 (CAV-1), a key component of LSEC fenestrations, was recently reported. mRNA expression for caveolin-1 (A), Fgl2 (C), and IL-33 (D) genes was evaluated by qRT-PCR. levels of production of IL-33 at 72 h p.i. in the liver of each mouse were quantified by immunohistochemistry. mRNA expression, production, and localization of IL-33 increased only in the livers of MHV3-infected mice. expression of IL-33 was induced only in the liver of MHV3-infected mice. expression of IL-33 was localized mostly in LSECs and to a lesser extent in hepatocyte nuclei. MHV3 infection leads to an imbalance of pro- over anti-inflammatory mediators in the liver. dysfunction of LSECs in MHV3-infected mice may favor the induction of a proinflammatory state in the liver. mRNA expression levels and production of IL-10 were markedly increased in the livers of 51.6-MHV3-infected mice compared to MHV3-infected mice. IL-10 expression in livers from 51.6-MHV3-infected mice was induced in the parenchyma and in venous and sinusoidal ECs. occurrence and intensity of IL-10 staining were weaker in MHV3-infected mice. groups of 5 or 6 mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1,000 TCID50 of MHV3, 51.6-MHV3 and YAC-MHV3. mRNAs of CXCL1 (A), CCL2 (C), and CXCL10 (E) were analyzed by qRT-PCR. values represent fold change in gene expression relative to that in mock-infected mice. production levels of CXCL1 (B), CCL2 (D) and CXCL10 (F) at 72 h p.i. in the liver of each mouse were quantified by ELISA. the kinetics of surface TLR2 and -4, endosomal TLR3 and -7, and helicase RIG-1 and MDA-5 gene expression in the livers of infected mice were compared by qRT-PCR from 24 to 72 h p.i. expression levels of the TLR3, TLR4, RIG-1, and MDA-5 genes were increased equally or more during MHV3 infection than during 51.6- or YAC-MHV3 infection. values represent fold change in gene expression relative to that in mock-infected mice. values are means and standard errors of the means. higher levels of inflammatory mediators in the livers of MHV3-infected mice may be associated with preferential and higher induction of PRRs. neutrophils (CD11bhi Gr1int), macrophages (CD11b+ Gr1int), B cells (CD19+) and T cells (CD8+ and CD4+) were analyzed by cytofluorometry. NK cell percentages increased more in MHV3- than in 51.6- and YAC-MHV3-infected mice. intrahepatic mononuclear cells isolated from groups of 5 or 6 mock-infected or MHV3-, 51.6-MHV3-, or YAC-MHV3-infected mice at 24 and 48 h p.i. percentages of NK-T cells (NK1.1+ CD3+) (A), NK cells (NK1.1+ CD3) (B), neutrophils (Gr1hi CD11bhi) (C), macrophag NK-T cells decreased only in the livers of MHV3-infected mice. total NK cells were not altered in all infected groups. number of neutrophils earlier but transiently increased at 24 h p.i. in MHV3-infected mice. 87 to 91% of isolated cells expressed the endothelial markers CD146, CD54 (ICAM-1), and CD31 (PECAM-1) but not the macrophage marker F4/80. LSECs were then infected by the MHV3 strains, and viral replication as well as CPE were monitored from 24 to 120 h p.i. LSECs were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with MHV3, 51.6-MHV3 and YAC-MHV3. the evolution of cytopathic effects in LSEC cultures was noted up to 5 days p.i. (B), and the kinetics of MHV infections were monitored. LSECs were infected at an MOI of 0.1 with MHV3, 51.6-MHV3 and YAC-MHV3. RNA and supernatant from LSECs infected with each viral strain were collected at 24, 48, or 72 h p.i. IL-33 (A), Fgl2 (C), and caveolin-1 (E) fold changes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. infected cells and not in 51.6-MHV3- or YAC-MHV3-infected cells (P 0.01) NO production was reported to be negatively regulated by CAV-1 through inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) activity. MHV3-infected mice showed a higher inflammatory response in the liver than mice infected by attenuated strains. IL-10 levels increased rapidly or progressively higher in 51.6-MHV3- and YAC-MHV3-infected LSECs than in MHV3-infected LSECs up to 72 h p.i. (P 0.05 to 0.001) TGF- expression, however, was not induced or was slightly induced in cells infected by the attenuated strains (P 0.05 and 0.01) production levels of IL-10 (B), TGF- (D), IL-6 (F) and TNF- (H) in supernatants were quantified by ELISA at 24 h p.i. production levels of CXCL1 (A), CCL2 (C), and CXCL10 (E) mRNA were analyzed by qRT-PCR. IL-6 mRNA expression reached higher levels in cells infected by virulent MHV3 than in those infected by attenuated strains only at 24 h p.i. (P 0.05 to 0.001) LSECs were also reported to secrete chemokines upon infection by dengue virus and to enhance their production in chronic inflammatory liver disease. in livers from MHV3-infected mice, we aimed to investigate whether MHV3 increased TLR2 expression on LSECs. levels of TLR2 mRNAs were significantly higher in cells infected by MHV3 than in those infected by attenuated strains at 24 h p.i. mRNA expression levels of MHV nucleoprotein (MHV-N) (B), IL-6 (C) and CXCL1 (D) were determined by qRT-PCR. mRNA expression levels of MHV nucleoprotein (MHV-N) (B), IL-6 (C) and CXCL1 (D) were determined. histopathological analysis of liver revealed fewer and smaller necrotic foci in MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice than in WT mice. comparable and barely detectable hepatic damage was noted in MHV3- and 51.6-MHV3-infected C57BL/6 (WT) and TLR2 KO mice. TLR2 activation by virulent MHV3 decreases IL-10 and increases inflammatory cytokine and chemokine expression. it was previously reported that hepatic levels of IL-6 and TNF- were reduced in MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice in comparison to C57BL/6 mice. this suggests a role for TLR2 in MHV3-induced release of inflammatory factors. expression of IL-10 in ECs was effectively higher in livers from MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice than in those from WT mice. expression of IL-10 in ECs was effectively higher in livers from MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice than in those from WT mice. or TLR2 KO mice were intraperitoneally infected with 1,000 TCID50 of MHV3 or 51.6-MHV3. at 72 h p.i., livers were collected from mock- and virus-infected mice. mRNA fold changes for several genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. in vitro infection of LSECs by the virulent MHV3 resulted in earlier cell damage and disorders in inflammatory and vascular factors. we showed that the higher replication rate and proinflammatory activity of MHV3 in LSECs was associated with its specific activation of TLR2 signaling in LSECs. the consequence of LSEC infection in inflammatory liver diseases such as viral hepatitis has never been investigated. MHV3 replicates more rapidly in Kupffer cells (KCs) than in LSECs in vitro. replication of the attenuated 51.6- and YAC-MHV3 variants was delayed to 96 or 120 h p.i. and was associated with barely detectable CPE, reflecting their weaker tropism for LSECs. 51.6-MHV3 infection resulted in lower viral replication, transaminase levels, and liver damage than MHV3 infection. the nonpathogenic YAC-MHV3, also with a low ability to replicate in LSECs, induced light and transient hepatic lesions. in vitro MHV3 infection promotes a proinflammatory activation of LSECs. IL-10 staining was significantly lower in ECs from the livers of mice infected by MHV3 than in those of mice infected by attenuated strains. importance of IL-10 production by LSECs in suppression of proinflammatory cytokine release by Th1 and Th17 cells was recently shown to be more efficient than KCs in tolerizing autoreactive Th1 cells via IL-10 (2). a proinflammatory profile was pointed out as a critical component of intrahepatic inflammation in hepatic fibrosis (40). differences in the LSEC cytokine profile according to infection by pathogenic or attenuated MHV3 strains may reflect differential PRR induction and activation by viral fixation and/or replication. IL-10 levels were significantly higher in MHV3-infected TLR2 KO mice. IL-10 expression was significantly upregulated in in vitro-MHV3-infected LSECs treated with siTLR2, suggesting an inhibitory effect for TLR2 on IL-10 induction by MHV3. preliminary in vitro results revealed that production of inflammatory mediators and viral replication in MHV3-infected hepatocytes and macrophages were enhanced by TLR2. chemokine levels induced by pathogenic and attenuated MHV3 strains may explain the differences in recruited intrahepatic leukocyte subsets. the constitutive expression of NO by LSECs is essential for the regulation of intrahepatic sinusoidal blood flow. impairment of NO release by LSECs has been associated with hepatic microvascular dysfunction and portal hypertension in pathological liver conditions. we have demonstrated that reduced NO levels in LSECs correlated with a concomitant upregulation of CAV-1. MHV3 infection increased IL-33 production in both LSECs and hepatocytes. a high IL-33 serum level was associated with liver damage in HBV and HCV infections. this suggests a novel virus-promoted mechanism of hepatic inflammation. the importance of LSECs, over that of other hepatic cells, in tolerance/inflammation imbalance during acute viral infection. RNA from HCV was recently shown to induce the expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in human microvascular endothelial cells via TLR3 activation. core proteins could also promote proinflammatory activation of LSECs via TLR2, aggravating hepatic inflammation."}
