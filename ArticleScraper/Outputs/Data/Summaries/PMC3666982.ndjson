{"summary": "many models incorporate sophisticated parameterization and validation techniques, economic analyses and the behaviour of individuals. results We found that many influenza pandemics models rely on parameters from previous modelling studies. models are rarely validated using observed data and are rarely applied to low-income countries. modelling is one of the only suitable methodologies to enable multiple hypothetical pandemic preparedness and mitigation scenarios to be assessed. epidemiological, economic, and individuals\u2019 behavioural questions have been supported by empirical findings that have echoed previous modelling predictions. for epidemic models to produce reasonable predictions on the course of the epidemic, we need to be confident that the model captures the essential mechanisms that drive the epidemic dynamics [15] models are widely used in epidemic modelling and can be represented by systems of differential or difference equations or stochastic rates. basic compartmental models assume perfect mixing between homogeneous individuals but can be expanded to account for different transmission rates between ages. agents-based models These models simulate interactions and decisions at the individual level. Optimal control and stochastic programming models aim to find the optimal way to control a system over time. these models are different to the other models that assume a level of control that is independent of the state of the system. by contrast, these models allow control to very depending of the final outcome or the state of the system. guide the reporting of these aspects together with model construction would help modellers and policy makers compare and evaluate models. we reviewed and classified models for influenza pandemic preparedness from January 2000 to September 2011. 91 articles were selected for the analysis. trends in parameterization and validation, incorporation of economic aspects and host behaviour. we evaluated capacity of the models to answer epidemiological questions. behavioural questions: would changes in the behaviour of the individuals during the pandemic influence the effectiveness of the interventions. predictive validation requires that the model predicts accurately data that were not used in its construction. it has also been argued that the credibility of a model might be provided by the credentials of the model building techniques, that sometimes involve contrary-to-fact principles that increase the reliability of the results. the articles were categorized according to the type of model used (Table 1), population heterogeneity level considered, parameterization procedure, consideration of economic impacts, inclusion of human behaviour and performance of validation or sensitivity analysis. the protocol builds upon previous protocols to describe ABMs [31] and retains the description of technical aspects of the models that facilitate its understanding. data is the model informed by data from previous pandemics. if so, what are the main sources of data in the model. how is stochasticity modelled\" interventions. model parameterization Describe which parameters were parameterized from previous pandemic modelling studies.

Sensitivity analysis can vary one parameter at a time (univariate) or multiple (multivariate) the comparison of the model predictions with the baseline parameter values gives an idea of how sensitive the model is to a certain parameter. Particle filtering is a parameterization technique based on the simulation and weighting of a sample of parameter values according to their consistency with the observed data. the algorithm is used to parameterize Bayesian models in which variables that cannot be observed are inferred by the model through connection in a Markov chain. sensitivity analysis, verification and validation aspects protocol (CCPV protocol) for influenza pandemic model reporting Categories Questions General characteristics Aim of the model What questions is the model trying to address. is the model aimed at generating predictions for future pandemics used to inform policy making. model is run without assumptions about pandemic-related changes to behaviour. how do results differ from the model considering such changes. sensitivity and uncertainty analysis have been undertaken. the prevalence of modelling for pandemic influenza has increased dramatically since 2000 (Figure 1B). out of the 91 articles included in the review, more than half of the models were compartmental. studies not focusing on high-income economies were scarce. the majority of studies were not intended to study impact in specific, localised settings. a few exceptions concentrated on the effects of school closures. real-time pandemic modelling articles involved sophisticated methods of parameterization using observed case data, such as maximum likelihood estimation [9] or sequential particle filtering within a Bayesian framework [43] real-time nature enabled the possibility of continuous open validation regarding the prediction of pandemic characteristics. the risk that this approach may perpetuate faulty parameterisations from previous studies may run the risk of overfitting or non-identifiability. it may be most credible to inform model parameters using a combination of field or laboratory studies data (e.g. to fit or even directly inform parameters such as recovery rates) and epidemic case data. software such as openBUGS [53] and JAGS [54] are making the use of MCMC algorithms accessible to non-specialists. parameterization becomes more difficult for large-scale simulation models like ABMs because they present many more parameters to be fitted but also because they make it harder to derive an explicit likelihood function making impossible the use of MCMC. structural and predictive validation may be easier to establish for compartmental models as they are (usually) based on epidemic theory for which results have been derived analytically. modellers may use these analytically soluble models to generate qualitative insights rather than quantitative predictions to inform policy. predictive validity is established by comparing model predictions to independently observed outcomes during a pandemic. complex models, such as ABMs, will only be more realistic than compartmental models provided there are data to support their added realism. comparisons of ABMs with their simplified compartmental \u2018analogue\u2019 will demonstrate whether the added realism of the ABM is justified by improved predictive power. useful to detect anomalies in the models [62] (\u201cmodel verification\u201d, Table 3. Implications for CCPV protocol Reporting the underlying assumptions governing the model, as well as their justification, would help model users evaluate the structural validity of the model. validation processes will show if the models are oversimplified and do not capture the salient features of the pandemic. fected or dying were commonly used to evaluate the effectiveness of any interventions considered. but only a minority of studies sought to address economic questions. this may be because epidemiological modellers lack the expertise to identify and model economic aspects. models were integrated in cost-effectiveness analysis of antiviral prophylaxis and vaccination. QALYs were lost and economic costs due to pandemic influenza. QALYs were obtained from clinical trial data. the integration of economic and epidemic models for pandemic preparedness does not yet appear to have explored all possible model combinations, with a large scope for modelling innovation. the review did not identify any study that combined such models with dynamic epidemic models in a way that both models feedback on to each other. not allowing feedback is reasonable if job absenteeism can be approximated as a sudden shock to the production systems. most pandemic models represent individuals as entities whose behaviour remains invariant. but in reality, human behaviour might hinder or foster pandemic mitigation efforts. new insights have been obtained by integrating compartmental models with game theory. the extent to which human behaviour can affect model predictions is poorly understood. behavioural assumptions, including homogeneity, in the model systematically and how the incorporation of individuals\u2019 behaviour affects model predictions with respect to the model without behaviour. data availability is also a major obstacle for the incorporation of human behaviour to models. a standardised ODD protocol for documenting ABMs has been published in the same journal. guidelines exist in the fields of health economics. authors declare no conflict of interests.
