{"summary": "dengue virus (DENV) is a mosquito-borne flavivirus responsible for serious disease and mortality in the tropics and subtropics. the mosquito ubiquitin protein Ub3881 (AAEL003881) was specifically and highly down-regulated. the protein has several antiviral functions in the mosquito. aedes aegypti is the main mosquito vector responsible for transmitting DENV to humans. aedes aegypti is the main mosquito vector responsible for transmitting DENV to humans. the mosquito is well-adapted to live in areas of human habitation. gypti study identified a number of mosquito genes that had significantly altered expression during flavivirus infection. one of these genes encoded a ubiquitin (Ub) protein (SeqID AAEL003881) was significantly down-regulated at all time-points examined in Ae. aegypti during infection with DENV. both herpes simplex virus type 1 and human papillomavirus are able to direct the tumor suppressor protein p53 for proteasomal degradation. inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system has also been shown to block various steps in the replication of several viruses. a comprehensive picture of the role of ubiquitin and individual ubiquitin pathway proteins during DENV infection in the mosquito transmission vector is still lacking. b3881 plays during DENV infection in the mosquito vector. the cells were grown at 30 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 in DMEM. the cells were supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum. qRT-PCR analysis RNA was isolated from infected Ae. aegypti mosquitoes on days 1, 2, 7 and purified using RNeasy kit. the quantitative RT-PCR analysis was done using the QuantiFast kit according to manufacturer's instructions. immunofluorescence analysis Aag2 Ae. aegypti cells were infected with DENV at an MOI of 0.1. at 24 h post-infection, infected cells and control cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 20 min at RT, washed with PBS() and stained for infection using antibodies against Ub3881, Imd or Relish proteins. plasmids were made from pAc5.1/V5-His A vector (Invitrogen, CA) and cloning was done using PCR along with gene-specific primers as previously described. we used the Qiagen mini-prep kit to isolate DNA from bacterial cultures. gel and Western blot analysis was done using the antibody against Ub3881. antibodies against Ub3881 and mosquito Imd proteins were used to precipitate proteins out of deNV-infected mosquito lysate. mosquitoes were briefly washed in 70% ethanol and then rinsed in sterile PBS. organs were stored in PBS with protease inhibitors for protein assays. qRT-PCR analysis RNA was isolated from infected mosquitoes. the siRNA was dissolved in sterile PBS and injected into the thorax. the membrane was blocked with 5% milk in 1% TBST for 1 h at RT. the membrane was incubated with the appropriate primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C. the protein blots were incubated with ECL substrates (Amersham, NJ) for 5 min at RT. expression plasmids were made from pAc5.1/V5-His A vector. cloning was done using PCR along with gene-specific primers. mosquito proteins were identified via amino acid sequence identity. antibodies against Ub3881 and mosquito Imd proteins were used to precipitate proteins out of deNV-infected mosquito lysate. results 3.1. mosquitoes were infected with DENV via blood feeding and at 1, 2 and 7 days post-infection, mosquitoes were homogenized and cell. qRT-PCR analysis was done to measure expression of ubiquitin genes. western blot analysis was done using the antibody against Ub3881. we orally infected Ae. aegypti with DENV and dissected MG and SG on 1, 2 and 7 dpi. the coding regions for Ub3881 and the representative ubiquitin gene Ub6511 were cloned into the insect expression vector pAc5.1/V5-His (Life Technologies, CA) the expression vectors were transfected into an Ae. aegypti mosquito cell line, Aag2, and the cells were infected with DENV. the overexpression of either protein had no significant cytotoxic effect on the cells. infection was down 10-fold in the mosquito MG and reduced up to 10-fold in the mosquito SG during Ub3881 overexpression. the reduction occurs in both MG and SG, the organs involved in acquisition and transmission of virus. we used RNA interference (RNAi) to block expression of Ub3881 with siRNA molecules designed against the Ub3881 gene. the standard insect RNAi method of injecting dsRNA transcribed from the target gene could not be performed due to the potential of non-specific knock-down. the siRNA was intrathoracically injected according to previous methods. we used the supernatant in a plaque assay on uninfected Vero cells. the supernatant from cells overexpressing Ub3881 resulted in a lower number of plaques than the supernatant from the control cells. this indicated that there is less infectious virus in cells overexpressing Ub3881. we performed qRT-PCR analysis to quantify DENV infection over time in the original Aag2 cells. the cells that had Ub3881 transfected showed significantly lower DENV infection, especially at later timepoints. together, this data suggest that Ub3881 expression results in less infectious dengue virions produced in the cells. Ubiquitin can regulate Imd immune signaling via attachment to the Imd protein. this may result in the transcription of innate immune genes, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). antibodies against Ub3881 and mosquito Imd proteins were used to precipitate from deNV-infected Ae. aegypti lysates. a portion of the solution was run on an SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot analysis was done. the solutions were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot analysis was done using antibodies against Ub3881 and mosquito Imd protein to localize the proteins in the cells. images were taken at 20. ubiquitin in insects is the initiation of cellular apoptosis, for example through the ubiquitination of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein [47], [48]. the antibody against human caspase-3 recognizes the cleaved (active) protein in insect cells. Fig. 4E presents 3 mosquito cells, as indicated by DAPI blue fluorescence. only the single green cell, indicating overexpression of Ub3881, also had red fluorescence. we then did Western blot analysis on the cell lysates using the same antibody against cleaved caspase-3. a group of control cells were not infected (Lane 1). Western blot analysis was done on cell lysates with antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 as a marker for apoptosis. the antiviral effects of Ub3881 are not blocked by proteasomal inhibition. b3881 overexpression with proteasomal inhibition over time found no significant changes within the first 96 h of infection. previous research has shown that the proteasome pathway may be required for flavivirus replication [35], thus the reduction of proteasomal activity may have directly caused the inhibition of DENV infection seen here. cells were transfected with the Ub3881 expression vector or a control GFP vector. qRT-PCR analysis was done using antibodies against the 19S proteasome and Ub3881. mock (uninfected) cells were used as controls. lysines K88, K157 and K163 contain 3 putative ubiquitination sites. this indicates that the ubiquitination of DENV E by Ub3881 is likely. the lysine at position 157 is the most likely to be involved. we also used DENV E protein to pull out E from the infected eluate as a control. we found that Ub3881 colocalized with the envelope protein in the infected cells. together, these results indicate that Ub3881 binds DENV E. against Ub3881 and DENV E proteins were used to precipitate proteins out of deNV-infected mosquito lysate. western blots were run with corresponding amounts of protein per lane as loading control. ubiquitin was the only mosquito ubiquitin in our screen to have significantly altered expression during DENV infection. qRT-PCR analysis was done to quantify levels of ubiquitin gene expression. we confirmed that Ub3881 is significantly down-regulated during DENV infection of Ae. aegypti at all time-points analyzed. other ubiquitin genes did not have significantly altered gene expression. at 1, 2 and 7 days post-infection, mosquitoes were homogenized. western blot analysis was done using the antibody against Ub3881. 3.2. Ub3881 gene expression and regulation during infection is tissue-specific. the coding regions for Ub3881 and the representative ubiquitin gene Ub6511 were cloned into the insect expression vector pAc5.1/V5-His. the expression vectors were transfected into an Ae. aegypti mosquito cell line, Aag2, and the cells were infected with DENV. the overexpression of either protein had no significant cytotoxic effect on the cells. qRT-PCR analysis was done to measure DENV infection levels. the overexpression of Ub3881 inhibits DENV infection in Ae. aegypti. qRT-PCR analysis was done to measure DENV infection. we used RNA interference (RNAi) to block the expression of Ub3881 with siRNA molecules designed against the Ub3881 gene. we used the supernatant in a plaque assay on uninfected Vero cells. the supernatant from cells overexpressing Ub3881 resulted in a lower number of plaques than the supernatant from the control cells. this indicated that there is less infectious virus in cells that are overexpressing Ub3881. supernatants were used in qRT-PCR analysis to quantify DENV infection over time in the original Aag2 cells. the cells that had Ub3881 transfected showed significantly lower DENV infection, especially at later timepoints. together, this data suggest that Ub3881 expression results in less infectious dengue virions produced in the cells. Ubiquitin can regulate Imd immune signaling via attachment to the Imd protein. the imd pathway was recently shown to be involved in antiviral immunity in insects. quantification of AMP expression levels was analyzed at 48 hpi. we identified both Aedes Imd protein and several 26S proteasome proteins as putative Ub3881 interactors. we used the antibodies we had made against each protein to precipitate them from deNV-infected Ae. aegypti lysates. results show that Ub3881 protein was pulled out with both the Ub3881 antibody and the antibody against mosquito Imd protein. antibodies produced against Ub3881 and mosquito Imd proteins were used to precipitate proteins out of deNV-infected mosquito lysate. the solutions were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot analysis was done using antibodies against Ub3881 and mosquito Imd protein. ubiquitin in insects is the initiation of cellular apoptosis, for example through the ubiquitination of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) protein [47], [48]. we transfected Aag2 cells with Ub3881 and/or infected cells with DENV. pase-3 recognizes the cleaved (active) protein in insect cells [49], [50]. only the single green cell, indicating overexpression of Ub3881, also had red fluorescence. we then did Western blot analysis on the cell lysates using the same antibody against cleaved caspase-3. a group of control cells were not infected (Lane 1). Western blot analysis was done on cell lysates with antibodies against cleaved caspase-3 as a marker for apoptosis. antiviral effects of Ub3881 are not blocked by proteasomal inhibition. no significant changes within the first 96 h of infection. previous research has shown that the proteasome pathway may be required for flavivirus replication. this may have directly caused the inhibition of DENV infection seen here. qRT-PCR analysis was done using antibodies against the 19S proteasome and Ub3881. cells expressing Ub3881 had much lower levels of all viral proteins than the control cells. the cells expressing Ub3881 had much lower levels of all viral proteins. lysines K88, K157 and K163 are putative ubiquitination sites. this indicates that the ubiquitination of DENV E by Ub3881 is likely. the lysine at position 157 is the most likely to be involved. antibody against DENV E protein was pulled out of mosquito lysate by Ub3881 protein. we also used DENV E protein to pull out E from the infected eluate. results indicate that Ub3881 binds DENV E and marks it for destruction. antibodies against Ub3881 and DENV E proteins were used to precipitate proteins out of deNV-infected mosquito lysate. the solutions were run on an SDS-PAGE gel and Western blot analysis was done using the antibody against DENV envelope protein. a ubiquitin ligase may mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of the core protein [54]. this is notable in light of our findings that the mosquito Ub3881 can bind and mark DENV envelope protein for degradation. alterations in host protein expression and levels of components of the ubiquitin-proteasome system have been associated with DENV infection in vivo and in vitro. ubiquitin protein ligase Parkin has been reported to target substrates for both autophagic and proteosomal degradation. a role in autophagy would be an interesting avenue to investigate. a role in autophagy would be an interesting avenue to investigate. mosquito ubiquitin Ub3881 has lysines at position 6, 27, 29 and 48. but not K11, K33 or K63. an inserted alanine at position 19 shifts the position of downstream lysines by one position. we found that increased amounts of Ub3881 caused increased apoptosis. this may suggest an intriguing role for Ub3881 in cell death during DENV infection. ubiquitination via a lysine other than K63 may be the mechanism behind the interaction. the action of DENV on Ub3881 expression might be enough to prevent any antiviral effects. the loss of Ub3881 function did reduce the level of apoptosis during DENV infection. the protein may also function as part of the innate immune response. more strategies involving the elimination of infection in the transmission vector could serve as strong complement vaccine approaches. understanding the effects of dengue infection on the mosquito, responses both common and unique to individual flaviviruses, will aid in developing broadly applicable methods to treat and prevent infection of the mosquito vector. lysines K88, K157 and K163 were putative ubiquitination sites. the sites are highlighted in red."}
