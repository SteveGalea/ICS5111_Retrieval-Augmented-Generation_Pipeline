{"summary": "hepatitis virus is a positive-sense RNA virus of the coronaviridae family. MHV-,A59 replicates in the brain, spinal cord and liver. inflammatory demyelination peaks in the spinal cord at approximately one month post-infection. mice lacking mature B- and T-cells exhibit more severe demyelination than immunocompetent mice. this is likely due at least in part to persistence of infectious virus. cytokines have been studied in the context of MHV-induced demyelination. two of these genes, TREM2 and DAP12, were among the most highly induced during MHV-induced demyelinating disease. the increased expression of genes that directly affect bone resorption and osteoclasts during demyelinating disease leads to the intriguing possibility that osteoclasts and microglia may have parallel roles. Isolation of primary murine cells Bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM) were generated from the hind limbs of B6 mice. macrophages were differentiated into macrophages by growth in L929 fibroblast secreted M-CSF. macrophages were seeded after 6-7 days in vitro. oligodendrocyte cultures were derived from a mixed population of cells isolated from the forebrains of 1- to 3-day-old neonatal C57/BL6 mice. when confluent, the oligodendrocyte-lineage cells were purified using a modified wash down procedure to remove astrocytes. a portion of the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for fifteen minutes. 350 ng of total RNA (from cells or tissue) was transcribed into cDNA using the superscript III reverse transcript kit (Invitrogen) 2 l of cDNA was combined with 12.5 l of iQ5 SYBR green mix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA), 6.5 l of DEPC-treated water. DNA was amplified using an iQ5 iCycler (Bio-Rad) the library was purified on a 6% TBE gel (Invitrogen) the quality of the library was verified prior to Illumina sequencing by cloning into Zero Blunt TOPO (Invitrogen) the library was analyzed by standard sequencing to determine a) the presence of adapters, b) appropriate size selection, c) abundance of ribosomal RNA, and d) the diversity of the library products. four-week-old mice were inoculated intracranially with 2000 plaque-forming units (pfu) of MHV-A59 [7] or an equal volume of uninfected cell lysate (mock infected) in 25 L of PBS containing 0.75% BSA. Tissues were flash frozen for later RNA isolation, fixed in phosphate buffered formalin for tissue embedding. confluent mixed glial cultures were shaken on day 4-7 in vitro to dissociate the loose top layer of microglia. the remaining adherent cells, mostly astrocytes, were trypsinized and re-plated at a 1:2 dilution. the medium was replaced after 30 minutes to remove contaminating astrocytes. a portion of the supernatant was removed and centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for fifteen minutes. twenty microliters of this supernatant was then injected into each of 3-5 nave four-week old B6 mice. these mice were observed for clinical symptoms of disease, and their brains, spinal cords, and livers were harvested at the indicated dpi. poly-A-containing mRNA was selected from 20 g of RNA pooled from 5 mice using the Dynabeads mRNA direct kit (Invitrogen) the mRNA was fragmented, a 5\u2019 phosphate was added using T4 polynucleotide kinase (Invitrogen), and the library was size-selected (60-200 nucleotides) on a 15% TBE-urea gel. reads were aligned to the mm9 genome using the v1.5 pipeline. differential expression was analyzed using DESeq [40] in the R statistical environment. pathway analysis was also performed using DAVID [42] MHV titers peaked 5 days post infection (dpi), and by 10-14 dpi infectious virus was no longer detectable in any of the organs as assayed by standard plaque assay. by 10-14 dpi, the mice began regaining weight and resume their normal grooming habits and activity levels. viral genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs persisted in the brain and, to higher levels, in the spinal cord. qRT-PCR was performed to quantify relative abundance of MHV-A59 genomic and subgenomic RNA mRNA7. data are plotted as means with SEM of 5-8 mice. to investigate whether very low levels of infectious virus are produced during the demyelinating phase of MHV infection. brain lysate from donor mice was injected into nave four-week old recipient mice. brains were harvested from these mice on indicated day post infection. cytopathic effects include syncytia, cell death, and rounding. MHV-induced demyelinating disease alters the transcriptome of host spinal cord tissue. total RNA was extracted from spinal cords of both mock- and MHV-infected mice sacrificed 33 dpi. resulting library subjected to 50-bp Illumina Solexa GAII sequencing. transcripts expressed exclusively on myeloid or lymphoid cells (24 genes), cytokines (5 genes), lysosomal components (3 genes), granzyme B, apolipoproteins C-II and C-IV, and a complement component (Cfb) the transcripts for which expression was significantly upregualted (894 transcripts) were analyzed using the functional annotation tool in DAVID.

MHV infection induced major changes in the transcription of genes involved in many facets of lipid metabolism and transport. expression levels of 22 genes involved in lipid transport, including apolipoproteins E, C1, C2, and C4, were also upregulated. eicosanoids, lipid-derived mediators of inflammation, are synthesized in response to a variety of stimuli. expression levels of ten other genes upstream of or involved in eicosanoid metabolism were upregulated in the MHV infected CNS. a subset of lipid processing genes that have increased expression in infected tissue include several genes known to be involved in human neurodegenerative diseases. encoding proteo-lipid protein 1 (PLP1), MBP, myelin oligodendrocyte protein (MOG), myelin-associated protein (MAG) and other structural protein components of the myelin sheath were expressed at similar levels in mock and infected tissue. increased expression of genes with roles in osteoclast development and function, including TREM2 and DAP12 is associated with MHV chronic CNS disease Microglia are CNS-resident macrophag characterized by late-onset demyelination in the CNS and osteopetrosis. increased expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (Acp5), bone sialoprotein (spp1), osteopontin and oncostatin M receptor was associated with chronic MHV induced CNS disease. in the uninfected mouse, TREM2 is expressed at high levels in the brain and spinal cord, but at minimal levels in the liver. expression of TREM2/DAP12 mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR. expression of basal levels of TREM2/DAP12 mRNA was determined by qRT-PCR in RNA from primary cell cultures. MHV genome and mRNA, but not infectious virus, persist in the central nervous system (CNS) of infected B6 mice. by 10-14 dpi, the mice began regaining weight and resumed their normal grooming habits and activity levels. viral genomic RNA and subgenomic mRNAs persisted in the brain and, to higher levels, in the spinal cord. by 60 dpi, all mice had completely recovered to similar weights as uninfected animals and exhibited normal hindlimb movement. brain lysates from the above infected (donor) mice were injected into nave four-week-old recipient mice. the recipient mice that were inoculated with brain lysates of donor mice sacrificed 5 or 14 dpi, but not from donor mice sacrificed 33 or 44 dpi, exhibited clinical symptoms of MHV disease. mice that were inoculated with 5 dpi donor mouse extract experienced minimal weight loss and clinical signs. fected intracranially with 2000pfu of MHV-A59 and brains were harvested from these mice on indicated day post infection. titers, if there were assayed, are indicated here. cytopathic effects include syncytia, cell death, and rounding. we used the DESeq package (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/DESeq/) to analyze changes in the host transcriptome during the demyelinating phase of MHV-A59 infection. found 909 transcripts for which expression was significantly altered (894 upregulated, 14 downregulated) only 2,502 transcripts were not expressed at all in either mock-infected or MHV-infected spinal cord. the 50 most highly differentially expressed transcripts are representative of the functional categories in Figure 2. the transcripts for which expression was significantly upregualted (894 transcripts) were analyzed using the functional annotation tool in DAVID. the most significant and non-redundant categories are represented here. -31 NM_007654 Cd72 6.36344867 5.95E-21 NM_008534 Ly9 6.437381518 5.53E-20 NM_144539 Slamf7 6.979726259 1.10E-19 NM_013706 Cd52 5.404143569 1.87E-19 NM_009850 Cd3g 6.89889651 4.92E-18 NM_009857 Cd8a* 7.247316069 5.82 53 Cd68* 5.132714539 1.32E-18 NM_031254 Trem2* 4.734450912 1.35E-18 NM_009690 Cd5l 7.137739453 3.80E-17 NM_031195 Msr1* 5.445227457 1.24E-15 NM_011426 Siglec1 6.552776952 2.08E-15 NM_008147 Gp49a* 8.808431827 6.92 the top 50 differentially expressed genes as determined by DESeq are represented. fold change values are log2 transformed. the common gene symbol and the associated NCBI accession number are both listed. the RNA-seq results were validated technically by qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR was used to detect expression of 4-5 genes in each category. fold changes of mRNA transcripts in infected mice were determined relative to mock infected. qRT-PCR data plotted are means with SEM of 5 mice. expression levels of genes encoding several cytokines/chemokines were upregulated in the spinal cords of infected mice harvested 33 dpi. the increased expression levels of MHC alleles H2-Eb1 and H2-D1, CD74 and cathepsin Z were confirmed by qRT-PCR using the spinal cord of MHV-infected animals. expression levels of 22 genes involved in lipid transport, including apolipoproteins E, C1, C2, and C4, were also upregulated. expression levels of ten other genes upstream of or involved in eicosanoid metabolism were upregulated in the MHV infected CNS. a subset of lipid processing genes that have increased expression in infected tissue include several genes known to be involved in human neurodegenerative diseases. 36 genes involved in differentiation, maturation, and function of myeloid-lineage cells showed increased expression in the 33-dpi MHV-infected spinal cord. these genes are involved in scavenging (CD68, MSR1), signaling (Ms4a7, Tyrobp, TREM2, Gp49a, and AIM [61-66]) and pathogen destruction (Lgals3 [67]) osteopontin and oncostatin M receptor were associated with chronic MHV induced CNS disease in humans. we studied expression levels of TREM2 and DAP12 mRNA expression levels in the brain, spinal cord, and liver in 33-dpi infected and mock-infected animals. in the uninfected mouse, TREM2 is expressed at high levels in the brain and spinal cord, but at minimal levels in the liver. mRNA induced levels were determined by qRT-PCR in RNA from spinal cord, brain, and liver of infected mice, 33 dpi. MHV genome RNA persists in the CNS for the lifetime of the mouse despite the inability to detect infectious virus during MHV chronic disease. the role of oligodendrocytes in supporting MHV persistence has been disputed. previous studies have shown that MHV persists selectively in oligodendrocytes. oligodendrocytes in the MHV infected brain are not apoptotic. antigen presenting cells activate and recruit lymphocytes to sites of infection and this pathway remains upregulated during MHV-induced demyelinating disease. the host is continuing to mount a cell-mediated immune response to the virus, as previously suggested. the CD8T-cell response to viral antigen is known to continue in the CNS. the sustained activation of lymphocytes, which is associated with sustained antigen presentation, is established not just for MHV-induced demyelination [1,43,107-112], but also for EAE [87,113,114] and multiple sclerosis [115-117] apolipoprotein E, apoE4, is a genetic risk factor for Alzheimer\u2019s disease. the expression levels of both CD36 and ABCA1 are also upregulated in demyelinating spinal cord tissue from mice with EAE. genes involved in the eicosanoid production pathway are also upregulated in the demyelinating CNS. polymorphisms in either of these genes found in individuals with, Nasu-Hakola disease cause demyelination and osteopetrosis, presumably resulting from defects in microglia and osteoclasts respectively. other myeloid-specific genes that were upregulated during MHV induced chronic disease are also important for osteoclast differentiation and function. these genes are more highly induced at 33 dpi in the spinal cord. this is consistent with studies suggesting that MHV persistence as well as demyelination is to a greater extent in the spinal cord than in the brain. osteoclasts and microglia may have several parallel functions. this study provides the first transcriptome-wide description of gene expression in the spinal cord of mice with MHV-induced demyelination. this includes understanding the pathways contributing to demyelination and/or perhaps remyelination, defining the cell types in which the expression of each of these classes of genes is induced. further studies will also focus on assessing the influences of translational and post-translational mechanisms that likely constitute another level of the host response to chronic MHV qRT-PCR primers were used to detect the level of expression of oligodendrocyte specific gene transcripts in spinal cords recovered from mock or MHV-A59 infected mice. none of the genes had significantly altered expression in infected mice compared to mock.
