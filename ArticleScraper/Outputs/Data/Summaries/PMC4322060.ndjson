{"summary": "MERS-CoV was isolated from a 60-year-old patient in the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. two of those three initial cases died, raising questions about the potential public health implications of this new virus 3. the virulence of the pathogen, as distinct from its transmissibility, remains uncertain. it is unclear whether CFR was elevated in the context of the spring 2014 outbreak. public reporting on MERS cases by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been limited. the list does not contain an additional 113 cases and 92 deaths announced on June 3 that were retrospectively identified by the Saudi Ministry of Health. the list does not contain an additional 113 cases and 92 deaths announced on June 3. the model is parameterized in terms of epidemic generations rather than calendar time. we performed model fits for both Riyadh and Jeddah using 6-, 7- and 8-day serial intervals. initial fits were performed using data as. 113 previously unreported cases and 92 previously unreported deaths were accounted for in the line list. as of June 2, 2014, 590 cases and 116 deaths were accounted for in the line list. as of June 2, 2014, 590 cases and 116 deaths were accounted for. simulated deaths from march 2012 to June 2014 were set to sum at 117 for each of the 1000 runs (simulated outbreaks) for each month, the mean number of simulated deaths was calculated using randomly generated data from all 1000 runs. this variable was then used to calculate mean estimates of pre-outbreak and through-outbreak CFR for each simulation. comorbidity (e.g., diabetes) and 17.1% of cases in women were reported as healthcare workers. one third (35.5%) of cases in women were reported as mild or asymptomatic, compared with 24.1% in men. both R and d are higher for jeddah, denoting a more explosive outbreak in jeddah, with correspondingly more intensive and effective control efforts. the estimated Re for the Riyadh and Jeddah outbreaks, over time, are plotted in Figure 3. color coding denotes 6-, 7-, or 8-day serial intervals as identified in figure legends. curves generated by fitting to the full outbreak time series differed little from those generated by fitting to only the initial 6 or 8 generations of data. IDEA fits accurately predict the full extent of high R0 outbreaks only when time series up to and including peak incidence and subsequent decline are used for fitting 12. the dark blue curve is generated using an IDEA model fit to the entire time series. the red and green curves represent IDEA models fit using only 4 or 6 outbreak generations. colored bars represent mean values for fatal (red) and non-fatal (blue) cases by month over 1000 runs. in all 4 simulations, 171 non-attributable deaths were randomly distributed across different periods of time. simulation 1 is an appropriate mean estimate of non-attributable deaths. if assumption is true, the CFR among Saudi cases during the spring 2014 outbreak may have been substantially less than in months prior (51%) simulated imputations of non-attributable deaths suggest that this may not have been the case during the spring 2014 MERS outbreak. this suggests that cases during the outbreak may have been characteristically different with respect to mortality risk factors from cases that occurred prior to the outbreak. the development of treatment protocols for those infected with MERS-CoV has limitations. the limitations include data quality, assumptions necessary for model building, and the potential impact that under-recognition of mild and asymptomatic cases may have had on our epidemiological estimates."}
