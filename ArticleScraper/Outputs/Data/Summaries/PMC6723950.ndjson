{"summary": "mannose-, galactose-, N-acetyl-glucosamine-, fucose- and sialic acid-binding lectins are not inhibited by simple sugars. griffithsin, a man-specific lectin isolated from the red alga Griffithsia sp., recognizes some of the high-mannose N-glycans exposed at the surface of gp120. thsin, other man-specific lectins belonging to different groups of algae have been identified and characterized, particularly with respect to their anti-HIV properties. the present review presents an exhaustive overview on the structure-function relationships of man-specific lectins from seaweeds. cloning and structural information have become available for a few seaweed lectins. brown algae OAAH-like Agardhiella subulata ASL-1, -barrel [8] ASL-2 -barrel Eucheuma amakusaensis EAA-1 -barrel [9] EAA-2 -barrel EAA-3 -barrel Eucheuma cottonii ECA-1 -barrel [10] ESA-2 -barrel Kappaphycus alvarezii KAA-2 mannose-specific lectins from seaweeds belong to four distinct structural scaffolds corresponding to monomeric structures that occur as single carbohydrate-binding modules or subsequently arrange in homodimeric structures. complex proteins with different functions occurring in seaweeds contain a lectin domain corresponding to a carbohydrate-binding module with man-specificity. griffithsin monomer (PDB) code 1LL2) is a mannose-binding seaweed lectin. a triangle at the edges of the -prism domain makes the two domain-swapped lectins an hexavalent man-specific lectin. the ribbon diagram shows the -prism-I organization of strands of -sheet. the OAAH family comprises the ASL-1 and ASL-2 lectins from Agardhiella subulata [8], EDA-2 and ESA-2 from Eucheuma denticulatum [10], and E. serra [11,12], KAA-2 and KSA-2 from Meristiella echninocarpa [8], MPA-1 and MPA-2 from Meristotheca papulosa [8], and SfL-1 and SfL-2 -sandwich jelly roll scaffold found in legume lectins (Fabaceae) also occurs in various man-specific lectins from different algae species including the green alga Ostreococcus tauri OtL [17], the brown alga Hydropuntia fisheri HfL, the yellow brown alga Nannochloropsis gaditana NgL [16] and the red alga Porphyra umbilicalis viciae lectins have two identical mannose-binding sites. they differ from the single-chain legume lectins. other man-specific lectins resemble the -sandwich monomeric structure. legume-related lectins, some of the amino acid residues forming the CBS also serve to coordinate a Ca2+ cation in close proximity. the amino acid sequences of proteins share 27.5% identity and 72.5% similarity, and a RMSD between 176 pruned atom pairs were 0.908 and 2.576. surface electrostatic potential (electronegatively and electropositively charged surfaces colored in red and blue, respectively; neutral surfaces colored grey) of BCA are indicated. mannose residues anchored to the CBSs of the lectin are colored cyan. lectins with carbohydrate-binding specificities similar to griffithsin have been isolated and characterized from bacteria, e.g., cyanovirin-N (CV-N) from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum [44], and fungi, e.g., actinohivin (AH) from the Actinomycete Longispora albida [45], which both displayed anti- the man-specific lectin from the red alga Griffithsia sp. was among the first man-specific lectins isolated and characterized from seaweeds. the lectin consists of a single polypeptide chain of 122 amino acids which contains three putative N-glycosylation sites 46NLS, 72NIS and 105NGS. the ribbon diagram shows the -barrel organization of strands of -sheet. Surface electrostatic potential is shown in transparency. ASL-1 and OtL lectins were modelled with YASARA. OAAH scaffold consists of a single polypeptide chain formed by two repeats of five -strands. two -barrels associate perpendicularly to build up the complete molecule. three CBSs occurring at both ends of the OAAH scaffold make all these man-specific red algae lectins with two tetravalent lectins. e chain organized in two antiparallel -sheets of six and seven strands, respectively, to form a -sandwich structure. red algae lectins differ from other homodimeric two-chain lectins of the viciae tribe of Fabaceae. unlike other viciae lectins, they possess two identical mannose-binding sites. legume-specific lectins resemble the -sandwich monomeric structure found in the canine ViP36 lectin (PDB code 2DUR) and the rat p58/ERGIC-53 lectin (PDB code 1GV9) [41]. in all of these lectins, some of the amino acid residues forming the CBS also serve to coordinate a Ca2+ cation in close proximity. -prism-II scaffold consists of three bundles of four -strands arranged into a flattened -prism structure around a central pseudoaxis. the man-specific lectin BCA from the brown alga Boodlea coacta exhibits a similar scaffold. docking experiments performed in silico suggest that both CBSs of the lectin are fully active and readily accommodate a mannose residue. lectin consists of three -harpins which adopt a triangular disposition to form a sort of -trefoil structure. other man-specific lectins have been isolated and characterized from other alga species, e.g., cyanovirin-N (CV-N) from the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum [44], and fungi, e.g., actinohivin ( inovirin lectin domain exhibits a -trefoil architecture (PDB code 3A07). the accommodation of high-mannose glycans by both lectins closely resembles that found in griffithsin and other man-specific seaweed lectins. an oligosaccharide-binding specificity allows the lectins to simultaneously accommodate several sugar units of a complex N-glycan, e.g., high-mannose glycans. the binding of simple sugars (Man, Glc, GlcNAc), dimannoside ( 1,6-mannobiose, maltose) and tri-branched high-mannose glycan (Man9GlcNAc2) to asp70 and Gly90 of CBS II, Asp109, Tyr110 and Asp112 of CBSIII accommodate the simple sugar in the monosaccharide-binding pocket of the three CBSs located at the top of the griffithsin domain. aromatic Tyr28, Tyr68 and Tyr110 residues also participate in stacking interactions with the pyranose ring of the mannose residues, that reinforce the binding of mannose to the CBS. the binding of disaccharides, 1,6-mannobiose (PDB code 2HYQ) and maltose (PDB code 2HYR) to the griffithsin CBS [53] reveals a very similar binding scheme with a single sugar unit anchored to the monosaccharide-binding pocket via a similar network of hydrogen-bonds. no interaction occurs between the second sugar unit of the disaccharide and the CBS. no contact occurs between other sugar units of the complex glycan and the griffithsin domain. this multisite binding scheme readily differs from that observed in other plant, algal and fungal lectins. griffithsin uses similar binding scheme to accommodate both simple sugars, dimannosides and complex high-mannose glycans. haride-binding pocket exhibits strong electronegative character. stacking interactions occur between tryptophan residue Trp10 and a pyranose ring of the ligand. mannose units of the disaccharide bind to amino acids located in and close to the monosaccharide-binding site via a network of hydrogen bonds. additional stacking interactions occur between the pyranose ring of the mannose units and two aromatic Phe112 and Phe114 residues. seaweed lectin BCA from the brown alga Boodlea coacta accommodates mannose at the CBS II via a network of hydrogen bonds linking the O2, O3 and O4 of mannose to residues Gln66, Asp68 and Glu70 forming the monosaccharide-binding pocket of the lectin. the clusters of terminal 1,2-linked mannose units are shown in red bold letters in both oligosaccharidic structures. the exclusive specificity for the clusters of terminal 1,2-linked mannose units groups BCA apart from other man-specific seaweed lectins 4.5. a stacking interaction occurs between phenylalanine residue Phe165 and the pyranose ring of the ligand. a stacking interaction occurs between phenylalanine residue Phe165 and the pyranose ring of the ligand. the mannose-binding pocket of the closely-related bacterial lectin cyanovirin-N [49] and fungal lectin actinohivin plays a key role in the accommodation of high griffithsin 2GUC, 2GUD (Man) [51,52] 2HYQ ( 1,6-mannobiose), 2HYR (maltose) [53] 3LL2 (9ManGlcNAc2) A network of seven hydrogen bonds between O3, O4, O5 and O6 of mannose and Ser27, Tyr28, Asp30 and Gly44 of CBS I, Asp67, Tyr68, Asp70 and Gly90 of CBS II, As Stacking interactions occur between tyrosine residues Tyr28 (site I), Tyr68 (site II) and Tyr110 (site III) and the pyranose ring of mannose ligands. water-mediated H-bonds that participate in the binding of mannose to the CBSs are not represented. the accommodation of more complex sugars by griffithsin, e.g., a tri-antennary high-mannose glycan chain Man9GlcNAc2 (PDB code 3LL2) [54], reveals a multisite interaction between the glycan and CBS II and CBS III of the lectin. only two mannose units located at both ends of the complex high-mannose glycan chain, readily interact with the monosaccharide OAAH lectins Docking of a pentamannosyl glycan to the CBS of the modelled lectins reveals an oligosaccharide-binding scheme very similar to those found in plant lectins. a mannose unit anchors to the monosaccharide-binding pocket while other mannose units interact with amino acid residues located in the vicinity. the binding of pentamannosyl glycan to the CBS is not represented. Coulombic charges (electronegative, electropositive and neutral regions are colored red, blue and white, respectively) at the molecular surface of EDA-2. the monosaccharide-binding pocket displays a pronounced electronegative (acidic) character. some of the amino acid residues involved in the H-bond network also serve as ligands for a Ca2+ cation. this contributes to improve the affinity of the legume lectin-like HFA for mannose and high-mannose glycans. displaying 1,2-linked mannose at the non-reducing terminus [18] can explain the higher affinity of BCA for 1,2-mannose clusters comprising three terminal 1,2-linked mannose units. clusters of terminal 1,2-linked mannose units are shown in red bold letters in both oligosaccharidic structures. an additional stacking interaction occurs between the pyranose ring of mannose and the pyranose ring of the ligand. the surface around the monosaccharide-binding pocket exhibits an electronegative (acidic) character. seaweed lectins display amino acid sequences with some degree of conservation. griffithsin shares 25% identity and 70% homology with jacalin-related lectins from higher plants. the jacalin-related -prism I domain is widespread distributed in all the living organisms. phylogenetic tree built from multiple amino acid sequence alignment of jacalin-related lectins from red algae (red boxes), plants (green boxes), fungi (orange boxes), and bacteria (blue boxes) lectins from unicellular ciliates are not boxed. the degree of conservation of the man-specific seaweed lectin domains is extremely variable. biomedical applications of man-specific seaweed lectins were especially applied in two directions. the tandem association of three gp120 molecules with three gp41 molecules forms the HIV-1-envelope spike. the tandem association of gp120 to gp41 results from the processing of the precursor gp160 by the host cell proteases. the fully accessible high-mannose glycan chains that decorate the gp120 units are rendered as cyan colored sticks. the high-mannose N-glycan chain decorating gp120 are rendered as cyan colored sticks. lectins which specifically bind to the high-mannose N-glycans exposed at the surface of gp120 interfere with the recognition of gp120 by the coreceptors of the CD4+ T lymphocytes. interaction of griffithsin with gp120 prevents gp120 from interacting with its co-receptors, like e.g., DC-SIGN [64] that inhibits the DC-SIGN-mediated capture and transmission of HIV to CD4+ T-lymphocytes. griffithsin is considered an efficient and safe anti-viral agent [63,68,76], the smaller 18-mer peptide derived from griffi several man-specific seaweed lectins have been investigated for their cytotoxic activity against various human and mouse cancer cell lines. several man-specific seaweed lectins have been investigated for their cytotoxic activity against various human and mouse cancer cell lines. ESA from Eucheuma serra provoked the apoptotic cell death of Colo201, HeLa and MCF-7 cells via the induction of the caspase-3-dependent pathway. the recognition of the altered high-mannose glycans associated to the cancer cells by marine algal lectins led to programmed cell death. miscellaneous biomedical properties of the Man-specific seaweed lectins were investigated, including their anti-bacterial and anti-nociceptive properties. an anti-depressant-like effect was also reported in mice for the man-specific lectin from the red alga Solieria filiformis. the tandem association of gp120 to gp41 results from the processing of the precursor gp160 by the host cell proteases. the fully accessible high-mannose glycan chains decorate the gp120 units are rendered as cyan colored sticks. bind to the high-mannose glycans exposed at the surface of gp120 interfere with the recognition of gp120 by the CD4+ T-lymphocytes. EC50 is in the range between 0.1 nM and 1.8 nM, depending on differences in methods used to quantify the anti-HIV activity of griffithsin in vitro. griffithsin possesses three CBSs in each monomer of the dimeric structure. multiple interactions occurring between the lectin and the high-mannose glycans of gp120 favor the stability of the gp120-DC-SIGN complex. griffithsin is considered an efficient and safe anti-viral agent. several man-specific seaweed lectins have been investigated for their cytotoxic activity against various human and mouse cancer cell lines. several man-specific seaweed lectins have been investigated for their cytotoxic activity against various human and mouse cancer cell lines. the recognition of the altered high-mannose glycans associated to the cancer cells by marine algal lectins led to programmed cell death. at a concentration of 1.2 g mL1, ESA from Eucheuma serra provoked the apoptotic cell death of Colo201, HeLa and MCF-7 cells via the induction of the caspase-3-dependent pathway. alga Phylum Alga Species Lectin Biomedical Property Ref.
