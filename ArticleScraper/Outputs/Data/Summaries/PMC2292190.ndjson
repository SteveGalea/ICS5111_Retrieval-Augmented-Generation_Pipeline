{"summary": "a large difference in HA incidence between Canada and HA-endemic countries has made travel an important contributor to hepatitis A prevalence in Canada. the volume of travel by Canadians to the US is many times higher than travel volume to endemic countries. travel to the US may constitute a source of low to moderate risk for Canadian travelers. hepatitis A (HA) is a non-endemic, low-incidence disease in the us and Canada. the average reported HA incidence in the us was 6.3 per 100,000 per year from 1980 to 1994. the average reported HA incidence in the us was 10.5 per 100,000 per year from 1980 to 1999. in the united states, the reported incidence had declined to 3.7 per 100,000 per year by 2001 [14,15] the true incidence of infection has been underestimated by approximately 8-fold in Canada and 10-fold in the US. there also exists an incidence differential between the two countries, with the US having somewhat higher incidence. hepatitis A is transmitted mostly by person-to-person contact, by the fecal-oral route [10] unlike most developing countries, hepatitis A is transmitted mostly by person-to-person contact, by the fecal-oral route [10]. age-structured model stratifies individuals according to epidemiologic status. exposed individuals enter the infectious compartment at per capita rate g i U S. vaccinated individuals lose their immunity at per capita rate f, re-entering the susceptible compartment. from 1998 to 2004, there were 4.6 times as many person-trips made within Canada as between Canada and the US [17]. Demographic and epidemiologic parameters are from the pre-vaccine era, 1980\u20131994. number of susceptible individuals in the united states at a given time t in age class i N/A (not applicable) N/A E i U S Number of exposed (infected but not yet infectious) individuals in the united states at a given time t in age class i N/A N/A N/A R i U S Number of recovered individuals in the united states at a given time t in age class i N/A N/A N/A V i U S Number g i U S Rate at which a susceptible person in age class i becomes vaccinated Varies according to scenario N/a N i U S Population size of age class i 20, 20, 40, 40, 40, 40, 60, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40, 40 (millions) YC is the incidence in the US (resp. endemic countries, Canada) where i U S (resp. i e n d) is the average duration of stay by travelers in the US (resp. endemic countries), and where i U S (resp. i e n d ) is the average duration of stay by travelers in the US (resp. endemic countries) Variable/Parameter Definition Values Reference S i C Proportion of exposed individuals in Canada at a given time t in age class i N/A (not applicable) N/A E i C Proportion of exposed individuals in Canada at a given time t in age class i N/A (not applicable) the age-structured model for Canada has identical structure to the US model. the term in the age-structured model takes the form of T i, U S C S i C, where T i, U S C = i, U S C j = 1 7 I j U S j = 1 7 I j U S, 1980 94. the function T i, U S C reflects our assumption that when the number of infected individuals in the US increases (resp. decreases), the number of Canadian individuals becoming infected due to travel in the US also increases (resp. decreases) the demographic and epidemiological parameter values for Canada are listed in Table 2. adjusted HA incidence in the 0\u20134 age class in the us decreases significantly. universal vaccination in the us at 70% coverage in the 0\u20134 age class causes a 21% decline in the adjusted Canadian incidence. the adjusted incidence is the reported incidence adjusted for asymptomatic infection. universal vaccination is implemented in the united states by vaccinating 70% of individuals in the 0\u20134 age class. adjusted incidence is the reported incidence adjusted for asymptomatic infection and under-reporting. the effect of an instantaneous 50% increase in the US adjusted incidence in 1995 is soon reflected in a 10% increase in Canadian incidence. the \"X\" denotes the actual volume of travel to the us in 1995. the travel axis ( i U S ) is the weighted average of the i U S for all the age classes. the plot indicates that both a reduction in travel to the US and an increase in vaccination levels in the US cause a decrease in HA incidence in Canada. a significant proportion (22%) of HA incidence in the mid 1990's, before vaccination was introduced, may have been attributable to travel in the US. some of the declines in HA incidence observed after 1994 may partly be due to the start of universal vaccination in the higher-incidence regions of the US in the mid-1990s. the dynamic model will overpredict the average population incidence before and after vaccination, and overpredict the percentage reduction in incidence due to vaccination. social heterogeneity in countries in risk factors and transmission patterns may be important for modelling certain aspects of disease transmission. the present model is the first to incorporate transmission of hepatitis A between countries. the worldwide SARS coronavirus outbreaks exemplified how a public health problem can quickly become a problem in others. the decline of hepatitis A in Canada may partly be attributable to universal vaccination in the us. entire countries can also \"free-ride\" by benefiting from vaccination programmes. vaccination policies and public health policies in one country will become increasingly important to other countries. in the future, multi-country or multi-regional models may come into more common usage. the possibility of such a connection is also supported by other evidence. d S i U S d t = S i U S j = 1 7 i j U S I j U S N j i, e n d U S i U S + f V i U S d i U S d i U S d i U S d i U S d i U S d t = i I i U S + E i U S d i I a0S0 = bN to represent recruitment into the youngest age class through birth, and a7 = 0. The simulations took as initial conditions S0 = E0 = R0 = V0 = 0 and I0>0. the number of births in the us in 1994 was approximately 4,000,000. the ageing parameter, ai, is simply the inverse of the time spent in each age class. the death rates are obtained by balancing the inflow and outflow for each age class. the mean duration of the infectious period, 1/, is approximately 2 weeks [27,28,36] the longer durations in younger age classes reflect the fact that virus is shed for longer in children than adults. i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S + a i 1 E i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i U S i to estimate the number infectious at any given time during the year, I i U S, we adjust the reported incidence per year per 100,000 in age class i, y i U S, for subclinical infection and under-reporting. this is then modified using the typical duration of infectiousness to obtain I i U S. the incidence in each age class is then divided by the probability of jaundice by age class Pi. I 1 U S = 10, 456, I 2 U S = 6, 590, I 3 U S = 3, 491, I 4 U S = 4, 560, I 5 U S = 3, 016, I 6 U S = 1, 750, I 7 U S = 1, 167 We make additional assumptions about the i j U S values. g 1 U S = g 3 U S =... = g 7 U S = 0.70 i = 2 7 N i U S = 0.70 i = 2 7 N i U S = 0.70 i = 2 7 N i U S = 7/15 year-1. the average number of births per year during this time was approximately 400,000. the total force of infection in Canada is i C = i, e n d C + i, U S C + j = 1 7 i j C I j C N j C i, e n d C i, e n d C i, e n d C i, e n d C i, e n d C i, e n d C i, e d 33,000 2 U S 542,000 2 e n d 33,000 3 U S 767,000 3 e n d 83,000 4 U S 1,553,000 4 e n d 246,000 5 U S 2,627,000 5 e n d 360,000 6 U S 5,559,000 6 e n d 757,000 7 U S 3,061,000 7 e n d 404,000 The average duration of travel to the US and to endemic regions are i U S = the actual coverage rates across age classes under the current targeted policy may be dissimilar, but the available data do not allow us to stratify the vaccine coverage rates by age. we assume the same vaccination rate applies to each age class. i N i U S = a i + 1 N i + 1 U S + d i + 1 U S = 1...6 Solving these equations using the above values for bUS, N i U S, and ai yields d 1 U S = d 2 U S = d 3 U S = d 4 U S = d 5 U S = 0, d 6 U S = 1 / 60 year 1, d 7 U S = 3 / 40 i U S = i U S + j = 1 7 i j U S I j U S N j U S N j U S = i U S i U S. This is substituted into Equation B2 at equilibrium with no vaccination (i.e. gi = 0, f = 0) in 1995, 4.8% of infected HA cases in the us acquired the disease through international travel [13]. in 1995, 4.8% of infected HA cases in the us acquired the disease through international travel [13]. the available age-specific number of cases for 2001 were adjusted for population sizes. y 4 U S = 18.5, y 5 U S = 12.2, y 6 U S = 4.7, y 7 U S = 4.7. the incidence in each age class is then divided by the probability of jaundice by age class Pi. we must modify Y i U S once again since it represents the number of cases per 100,000 per year. g 1 U S = 11 U S, 2 U S = 12 U S = 22 U S = 21 U S, 3 U S = 13 U S = 23 U S = 32 U S = 31 U S, 4 U S = 14 U S = 24 U S = 34 U S = 44 U S = 43 U S = 42 U S = 41 U S, etc. i = 2 7 V i U S = 0.70 i = 2 7 N i U S = 0.70 i = 2 7 N i U S = 7/15 year-1. average number of births per year during this time was approximately 400,000. the average duration of travel to the US and to endemic regions is i U S = 7.20 nights and i e n d = 18.30 nights respectively. the incidence per 100,000 per year in the US, Canada and endemic countries, adjusted for under-reporting and subclinical infection, are estimated as YUS = 215.56, YC = 156.83, YEnd = 1250.00 [16]. all these values are substituted into Equation 2 to obtain the values appearing in Table 5. i j C is found using the same methods as for the US model, yielding values for i C (see Table 5). prepub Acknowledgements AW and CTB were supported by Discovery Grants from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada."}
