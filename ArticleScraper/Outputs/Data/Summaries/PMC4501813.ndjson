{"summary": "spray dried porcine plasma is a protein source used in pig feed. plasma is separated from red blood cells by centrifugation, concentrated and submitted to a thermal process of >80\u00b0C throughout its substance. SDPP is a safe product, but the introduction of redundant safety features to the manufacturing process is prudent. weaned pigs fed diets with UV-C processed SDPP were housed in compliance with the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European parliament and of the council of 22 September 2010. the animal experimental procedure was approved by the animal experimentation ethics committee of IRTA and no specific permit was required. only 9 s are required for 10 L of product to pass through the system once at a flow rate of 4000 L/h. one pass of the product through the system is equivalent to a UV-C dose of 22.95 J/L or 23.40 mJ/cm2. plasma was derived from whole blood collected from a spanish slaughter facility. animals were inspected and approved to be slaughtered for human consumption. blood was collected into stainless steel pans containing anticoagulant. experiment 2 Porcine plasma was derived from whole blood collected from a spanish inspected abattoir. animals were inspected and approved to be slaughtered for human consumption. blood was collected into stainless steel pans containing anticoagulant.

UV-C irradiation has been shown to inactivate microorganisms in turbid liquids like fruit juices and wine [4,23] and milk [24]. in experiment 1, UV-C irradiation was very effective for inactivating PPV, thus indicating successful reduction of a model virus inoculated in liquid bovine plasma. UV light inactivates all waterborne viruses, bacteria and protozoa studied. results of the pig feeding experiment indicated that dietary SDPP improved pig performance compared to pigs fed the control diet without SDPP. chemical treatment of SDPP with formaldehyde is not allowed in many countries including the EU. pigs were fed diets with UV- irradiated plasma compared with non UV irradiated plasma diets. the results are in agreement with the reported values indicated by DeRouchey et al. [30,31] and Groesbeck et al."}
