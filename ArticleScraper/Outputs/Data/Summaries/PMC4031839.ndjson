{"summary": "all patients admitted to the intensive care unit between may 2009 and December 2010 with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia caused by the influenza A H1N1 virus were included in the study. the data of 45 patients were evaluated. CAP is the leading cause of death from infectious diseases. mortality rates are approximately 1% for outpatients and as high as 14% for hospitalized patients. the 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic had significant morbidity. METHODS Retrospectively and prospectively collected data from adult patients admitted to the hospital de base de so Jos\u00e9 do Rio Preto. data were collected between May 2009 and December 2010 from patients with a diagnosis of severe pneumonia caused by the influenza A virus H1N1 (H1N1). the results were expressed as the mean and standard deviation or median and 25th -75th percentiles. the statistical analysis used Student's t test to compare two groups of normally distributed continuous variables. mechanical ventilation (86.7% versus 13.3%; p0.05) and mortality rate were higher in the H1N1 group than in the CAP group (53% versus 20%, respectively; p=0.056) days of hospitalization 8.0 (5.0-15.0) 8.0 (6.0-11.0) 8.5 (2.7-24.0) 24 (15.7-28.2) 27.0 (19.2-9.5) 18.0 (9.0-3.7) CAP - community-acquired pneumonia; S - survivor; NS - nonsurvivor; CVD - cardiovascular disease; COPD - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; CRF - chronic renal failure; ICU - intensive care unit. 5,981 versus 14,1306,514; p0.05 for both) and significantly lower serum PCR levels. inflammatory parameters during first week of hospitalization for the two groups, H1N1 and community-acquired pneumonia survivors and nonsurvivors. 9,5304,873 (N=6) 96,007,379 (N=6) 12,6367,792 (N=28) 13,0708,513 (N=23) 10,6402,285 (N=5) Leukocytes D5 10,6915,657 (N=11) 9,9336,868 (N=6) 11,6004,375 (N=5) 13,1798,180 (N=28) 13,6658,826 (N=23) 10,9403,95 19.410.1 (N=6) CRP D4 11.38.1 (N=11) 5.66.8 (N=5) 16.15.5 (N=9) 16.910.3 (N=24) 15.711.2 (N=5) CRP D5 6.77.0 (N=11) 3.23.4 (N=6) 10.88.2 (N=5) 12.39.8 (N=28) 12.710.6 (N=23) 10.55.3 (N=5) CRP D6 5.37.2 (N=9) 2.52.3 H1N1 CAP total S NS Total S NS P/F D1 12192 (N=5) 16594 (N=3) 5443 (N=2) 20594 (N=30) 20893 (N=24) 192106 (N=6) P/F D2 145113* (N=6) 2834 (N=2) 7646 (N=4)# 24690 (N=25) 25092 (N=19) 23491 (N=6) P/F D1 1.230.3 (N=12) 1.20.37 (N=6) 1.2 0.33 (N=6) 1.390.6 (N=29) 1.340.64 (N=23) 1.620.43 (N=5) Creatinine (mg/dL) D3 1.390.5 (N=10) 1.060.27 (N=5) 1.720.59 (N=5)# 1.220.7 (N=29) 1.320.84 (N=4) 1.150.39 (N=4) compared with patients who were admitted with bacterial CAP, the H1N1 group had younger patients and a higher prevalence of obesity. significant differences were observed in the leukocyte count, CRP and oxygenation profiles. studies have demonstrated the utility of serial CRP measurements as a tool for diagnosis and monitoring of the response to CAP and nosocomial pneumonia treatment. kinetics of serum CRP levels in patients with severe H1N1 pneumonia remain unknown to date. the mortality rate in this series was 53% for patients with H1N1. the mortality rate in this series was 53% for patients with H1N1. a homogeneous population with severe forms of pneumonia supports the findings."}
