{"summary": "HIV-1 is transferred to uninfected cells most efficiently if infected and uninfected cells directly contact each other. such transmission requires successful assembly and release of viral particles from infected (producer) cells followed by their entry into adjoining uninfected (target) cells. cytoskeleton-interacting proteins regulate cortical actin and aid in the recruitment of CD4 and coreceptors to the site of viral attachment and entry. disruption of actin dynamics using drugs has been reported to have only small effects on HIV-1 assembly and release (25, 28, 29), suggesting that these steps are not dependent on the cytoskeleton. however, these analyses do not allow one to make predictions about whether these cytoskeletal structures are important for virus dissemination via cell-cell contacts. phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) is essential for Gag targeting to the plasma membrane. ezrin is required for proper microcluster mobility in both T and B cells. kinase ZAP-70 is positioned at the IS by ezrin. previous studies examining ERM proteins in the target cell have documented both positive (8, 49) and negative (50\u201352; also our unpublished results) roles for these proteins during the early phase of the HIV-1 replication cycle, as well as during the early phase of other viruses (53). here, we focused our investigations on the potential importance of ERM proteins in producer cells by evaluating how these proteins contribute to (or counteract) successful cell-to-cell transmission. reagent was obtained from John Moore and Catherine Spenlehauer through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. primary CD4+ cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS and 25 units/ml IL-2, activated with 5 g/ml phytohemagglutinin (PHA) for 24 h, washed, and infected as described below. rabbit anti-ezrin (catalog no. 3145) and rabbit anti-moesin (catalog no. 3150) were used for detection of C-terminal phosphorylation of ERM proteins. mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control when needed. oligos were annealed and ligated into PBS-hU6-1 using BbsI and XhoI restriction sites in order to obtain a Pol III promoter. this vector was digested with XbaI and XhoI and ligated into the FG12-Puro vector described above. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min, washed, and resuspended in complete medium. cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min, washed, and resuspended in RPMI plus 10% FBS medium. in cases when spinoculation was not used, cells were incubated for 4 h. two days later, infected producer cells were mixed with 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (invitrogen)-labeled target cells (either CEMss or primary CD4+ cells) at a 1:1 ratio (infected:target) on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated MatTek plates. after 2 to 3 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min, blocked and random fields were imaged at a magnification of 20 using the Nikon Eclipse Ti-E setup described above. images were then imported into FiJi, infected and uninfected cells were circled using differential interference contrast (DIC) the mean fluorescence was then recorded in the desired channel (either total ERM or pERM) two similar-sized, non-VS zones of the same cell were also measured for the mean intensity of pERM or CD81 channel. a total of 55 synapses were analyzed using shScramble cells as producers and 53 synapses using shEzrin cells as producers pooled from three independent experiments. infected shScramble or shEzrin cells were spinoculated with 10 ng VSV-G pseudotyped NL4-3 iGFP. two days later, infected producer cells were counted and mixed with 7-hydroxy-9H-(1,3-dichloro-9,9-dimethylacridin-2-one) (DDAO; Invitrogen)-labeled CEMss target cells. three million shScramble or shEzrin cells were spinoculated with 5 ng VSV-G pseudotyped NL4-3 as described above. two days later, equal numbers of cells from each condition were mixed with CEM-luc cells with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), zidovudine (AZT; 10 M); or plerixafor (AMD3100; 500 nM) g and CMAC were counted as syncytia, and the percentages of infected cells forming syncytia over three separate experiments were quantified. GraphPad Prism 5 showed the percentages of infected cells forming syncytia. e inhibitor cocktail (catalog no. P834D; Sigma), loading buffer was added. protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-FL; Millipore), blocked with Li-Cor blocking buffer (Li-Cor), and probed with primary antibodies. samples were analyzed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer. primary CD4+ cells were cultured in RPMI medium containing 10% FBS and 0.8 mg/ml G418 (Cellgro) primary CD4+ cells were purified using a Ficoll separation of whole blood isolated from healthy donors. reagents were obtained through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH. rabbit anti-ezrin (catalog no. 3145) and rabbit anti-moesin (catalog no. 3150) were used for detection of C-terminal phosphorylation of ERM proteins. mouse anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as a loading control when needed. oligos were annealed and ligated into PBS-hU6-1 using BbsI and XhoI restriction sites in order to obtain a Pol III promoter. this vector was digested with XbaI and XhoI and ligated into the FG12-Puro vector described above. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min, washed, and resuspended in complete medium. cells were then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 45 min, washed, and resuspended in RPMI plus 10% FBS medium. in cases when spinoculation was not used, cells were incubated for 4 h. two days later, infected producer cells were mixed with 7-amino-4-chloromethylcoumarin (invitrogen)-labeled target cells (either CEMss or primary CD4+ cells) at a 1:1 ratio (infected:target) on poly-l-lysine (Sigma)-coated MatTek plates. after 2 to 3 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min, blocked and random fields were imaged at a magnification of 20 using the Nikon Eclipse Ti-E setup described above. images were then imported into FiJi, infected and uninfected cells were circled using differential interference contrast (DIC) the mean fluorescence was then recorded in the desired channel (either total ERM or pERM) two similar-sized, non-VS zones of the same cell were also measured for the mean intensity of pERM or CD81. an area devoid of cells was measured to calculate the background intensity value for each channel. the VS \u201cenrichment factor\u201d of pERM or CD81 was calculated by dividing the VS signal intensity by the non-VS signal intensity. infected shScramble or shEzrin cells replicated for 6 days. supernatants were harvested and p24 content was measured by ELISA. TZM-bl cells were plated in a 96-well format, and 0.1 ng of virus produced from either shScramble or shEzrin cells was added per well. three million shScramble or shEzrin cells were spinoculated with 5 ng VSV-G pseudotyped NL4-3 as described above. two days later, equal numbers of cells from each condition were mixed with CEM-luc cells with either dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), zidovudine (AZT; 10 M), or plerixafor (AMD3100; 500 nM), and luciferase activity was measured 24 h ed as syncytia, and the percentages of infected cells forming syncytia over three separate experiments were quantified. GraphPad Prism 5 showed the percentages of infected cells forming syncytia over three separate experiments. protein was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-FL; Millipore), blocked with Li-Cor blocking buffer (Li-Cor), and probed with primary antibodies. samples were analyzed on a BD LSR II flow cytometer. pERM and HIV-1 Gag colocalize in T cells. we infected infected CEMss or primary CD4+ T cells with NL4-3. pERMs are localized to polarized HIV-1 assembly sites. pERMs accumulated at the HIV-1 VS in the majority of conjugates examined in both CEMss and primary CD4+ T cells. comparable localization of pERMs at the VS was observed when Jurkat cells were used as producers. ezrin seemed to be the predominant ERM protein at the synapse. cells were mixed with autologous uninfected T cells, fixed, and stained for Gag and either total ERM or pERM. the mean fluorescence intensity of total ERM or pERM was calculated per cell. shMoesin cells failed to recover during selection phase, suggesting moesin expression is essential for continued growth of CEMss cells. however, when ezrin levels in these shEzrin cells were assessed by Western blotting (Fig. 3A), immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B) and flow cytometry (Fig. 3C), the average ezrin reduction in multiple (independently generated) cell lines was never more than 50%. to measure infectivity, we harvested supernatants from infected cultures. equal amounts of p24 from supernatants of either shScramble or shEzrin cells were then added to TZM-bl reporter cells. after 48 h, -galactosidase production was. infected shScramble or shEzrin cells were cocultured with CMAC-labeled CEMss cells, fixed, and stained for Gag and pERM. the relative enrichment of pERM proteins at the VS was 10-fold in shScramble producer cells but was reduced to 5-fold in shEzrin cells. infected shScramble or shEzrin cells formed synapses with target cells. pERM intensity was measured at the synapse and compared to a non-synapse area of the same cell. representative images (A) and quantification of all synapses (B) pooled from three independent experiments. luciferase signal was found to be 2-fold higher when shEzrin cells were used as producers than when shScramble cells were used. luciferase signal was found to be 2-fold higher when shEzrin cells were used as producers. ezrin knockdown does not affect viral transfer to target cells. iGFP-infected shScramble or shEzrin cells were either fixed and stained for Gag (A) or cocultured with DDAO-labeled targets. luciferase signal can be the result of either \u201ctrue\u201d viral infection derived from cell-to-cell transmission. shEzrin cells show elevated levels of HIV-1-induced cell-cell fusion. the outline of a cell-to-cell transmission assay shows how luciferase production in this assay can be stimulated by newly synthesized Tat (upper half) and/or by Tat that can transfer into target cells upon cell-cell fusion. luciferase production in infected shCEMss cells was measured 24 h and 48 h later. luciferase activity was measured 24 h and 48 h later. luciferase signal was largely sensitive to treatment with reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT. luciferase signal at 24 h results from cell-cell fusion and not productive transmission. AZT treatment inhibited productive transmission in the coculture assay only 3.5-fold at the 48-h time point. AZT treatment of free virus inhibited transmission about 11-fold. individual infected cells and products of cell-cell fusion events, i.e., syncytia, were identified by the presence of either just Gag (individual cells) or Gag and CMAC (syncytia) a 50% ezrin depletion in producer cells leads to a doubling of HIV-1-induced syncytium formation. levels of CD81 at the virological synapse and overall levels of F-actin synapses were identified by the polarization of Gag toward the target cell. CD81 intensity was measured at the synapse and compared to a non-synapse area of the same cell to calculate the relative enrichment. data are representative of multiple independent cell lines per technique. pERM and HIV-1 Gag colocalize in T cells. uninfected CEMss cells were stained for pERM and imaged. pERM levels are diminished in HIV-1-infected T lymphocytes. kat cells were used as producers. ezrin seemed to be the predominant ERM protein at the synapse. in primary CD4+ T cells, ezrin seemed to be the predominant ERM protein at the synapse. pERM accumulates at the HIV-1 virological synapse. pERMs accumulated at the VS, overall, unconjugated HIV-1-infected cells seemed to express far less pERM than their uninfected counterparts. we mixed infected CEMss or primary CD4+ T cells with uninfected CMAC-labeled autologous T cells and stained them for Gag and either total ERM or pERM. levels of ezrin were determined in shScramble and shEzrin cells via Western blotting (Fig. 3A), immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 3B), and flow cytometry (Fig. 3C) levels of ezrin were determined in multiple (independently generated) cell lines. levels of ezrin were determined in shScramble and shEzrin CEMss cells. tted for gp120 and p24 for statistical analysis. mean was considered significantly different if the P value was 0.05. we first examined whether (partial) ezrin depletion in producer cells alters HIV-1 assembly and release. comparable levels of virion-associated gp120 were found in particles released from shScramble and shEzrin cells. pERM depleation decreases relative amount of pERM proteins at the VS. infected shScramble or shEzrin cells were cocultured with CMAC-labeled CEMss cells. a representative blot (C) and quantification of three independent infections (D) are shown. to measure transmission, we mixed infected shScramble or shEzrin cells with CEM-luc cells and measured luciferase 48 h later (E) shScramble and shEzrin cells were spinoculated with NL4-3 iGFP. they were then either fixed and stained for Gag or mixed for DDAO-labeled target cells. se signal was 2-fold higher when shScramble cells were used as producers. ezrin knockdown does not affect viral transfer to target cells. iGFP-infected shScramble or shEzrin cells were either fixed and stained for Gag (A) or cocultured with DDAO-labeled targets with the indicated antibodies for 3 h, trypsinized, and fixed (B). DDAO target cells that are GFP positive are indicative of viral transfer. cell-to-cell transmission assay shows how luciferase production can be stimulated by newly synthesized Tat (upper half) and/or by Tat that can transfer into target cells upon cell-cell fusion. luciferase activity was measured 24 h and 48 h later. luciferase signal was largely sensitive to treatment with reverse transcriptase inhibitor AZT. luciferase production in infected cells can result from transmission of viral particles followed by integration and subsequent transcription of the viral genome. luciferase signal should appear at 24 h and be insensitive to AZT, yet sensitive to AMD-3100. AZT treatment inhibited productive transmission in the coculture assay only 3.5-fold at the 48-h time point. AZT treatment of free virus inhibited transmission about 11-fold. results consistent with recent data showing that cell-to-cell transmission of HIV-1 is more resistant to treatment with reverse transcriptase inhibitors than cell-free infection (60). a 50% ezrin depletion leads to a doubling of syncytium formation. levels of CD81 at the virological synapse and overall levels of F-actin are reduced in shEzrin cells. a known interaction partner of ezrin, CD81, is also present at the virological synapse. phalloidin levels were visualized and measured based on phalloidin staining using immunofluorescence (C) and flow cytometry (D). data are representative of multiple independent cell lines per technique. scale bars = 10 m. pERMs were present at assembly sites, but these proteins only partially colocalized with Gag. localization of ERM proteins at the VS is consistent with data which documented that HIV-1 assembly takes place at the uropod of T lymphocytes. despite being specifically enriched at the VS, pERM levels, overall, were clearly decreased in infected cells, a finding that was also confirmed by flow cytometry (data not shown). since HIV-1 typically alters the expression of specific cellular proteins to ensure that viral replication can proceed unhindered, it seems likely that the virus benefits from pERM downregulation. nt cells express all three ERM proteins, possibly explaining the different outcomes. we first examined synapses using immunofluorescence and found that phosphorylated ezrin (p-ezrin) is the predominant pERM protein at the VS. we also measured a significant increase in luciferase signal derived from production. the finding that ezrin regulates cell-cell fusion at the VS is reminiscent of a recent report demonstrating that this ERM protein can also regulate non-virus-induced membrane fusions in vivo. it seems reasonable to assume that this ERM protein does not directly interfere with conformational changes in viral or cellular fusogens required for membrane fusion. ezrin depletion correlated with decreased CD81 levels at the cell-cell contact site, indicating that the fusion inhibition mediated by these two proteins may be mechanistically linked. tetraspanin overexpression blocks syncytium formation at a posthemifusion stage (86), suggesting that both ezrin and CD81 may be involved in the pore opening phase of fusion. the VS by regulating the fusion of producer and target cells."}
