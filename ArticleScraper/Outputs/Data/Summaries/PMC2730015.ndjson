{"summary": "no clear relationship has been found between the occurrences of these four bases in an individual strand of a gene sequence. the author considered the GC content of DNA sequences of organisms and mutations of GC base pairs to AT base pairs. the model is useful for pairwise distance measures and phylogenies. but a relationship defining base composition in a DNA sequence is not clearly realised. the optimal model can be chosen based on the amount of information contained or lost. a purine-pyrimidine sequence map provided a visual rendition of the growth of purine and pyrimidine numbers in a DNA sequence, which was interpreted by the authors as indicative of an inherent fractal nature in the purine-pyrimidine structure of the DNA sequences. the first graphical representation of a DNA sequence was proposed by Hamori et al. a 2D representation was proposed by Gates [10] and rediscovered independently by Nandy [11] and Leong & Morgenthaler [12] with different axes identifications for the four bases. these were followed subsequently by many different approaches to render a visual representation of the DNA sequences. these applications have been found to be very useful in elucidating different characteristics of DNA sequences that are not easily accessible in other ways. one approach using geometrical mapping proposed by Raychaudhury and Nandy [20] has been found to be useful for several calculations based on the 2D graphical representation. the other approach is to use matrix methods by forming ratios of graph theoretic and Euclidean distances between nodes of the graphical plots. sequences [25] and mass Spectra outcomes of proteins and/or protein serum profiles in parasites [26], toxicoproteomics and diagnosis of cancer patients [28]. quantitative structure-activity Relationship (QSAR) models may be used to study sequence-sequence similarity but also to predict unknown entries. structure here refers not only to drug structure but also to DNA sequence, RNA sequence or secondary structure, and protein sequences or 3D structure. the method to plot a DNA sequence is to start at the origin and take a step in the positive x-direction for a guanine base, in the negative x-direction for an adenine, positive y-direction for a cytosine and the negative y-direction for a thymine. this way a succession of bases in the original DNA sequences is represented by a succession of points in the 2D plot. a plot of the human beta globin gene complete cds generated using the above algorithm. a random distribution of the a,g,c,t along the sequence could be expected to generate a random walk. a random distribution of the a,g,c,t along the sequence could be expected to generate a random walk. 2D graphical representations of three histone H4 sequences: wheat (brown), maize (pink) and chicken (blue) the three plots can be seen to have similarities in shape. the 2D graphical plot of the randomised human beta globin gene. the sequences of the conserved genes, both intronless and with-introns, have close similarities. the general nature of the DNA walks on the 2D representation as per the Nandy prescription [11] shown in the above figures is directional and curvilinear. a simple 2nd degree polynomial produces reasonable fits. hsp70G PHHSP70G AT-rich 0.2847 4.00E-06 0.846 C elegans hsp16C CEHSP16C AT-rich 1.1824 0.0002 0.9848 D pseudobscura hsp82 DPHSP82 AT-rich 1.4998 0.0041 0.9097 Soyabean hsp 26-A SOYHSP AT-rich 0.6283 0.0009 0.9473 Human alpha glob 00409 GC-rich 0.9817 0.0049 0.7268 Oppossum beta globin beta-M OPOHBBB AT-rich 0.5623 5.00E-05 0.9431 X tropicalis larval beta globin Y00501 AT-rich 1.5184 0.0013 0.9493 H5N1 neuraminidase genes. other plots from a sample of over 600 sequences of the H5N1 neuraminidase show similar quadr chicken beta globin gene with intron sequence representation in the 2D framework gives a very poor fit for the quadratic function (R2 = 0.06) but much better statistics with a cubic polynomial (R2 = 0.98) some sequences where significantly large segments are at variance with the overall pattern too cannot be put into such slots. in the case of the human beta-globin gene a polynomial of the third degree yields better statistics (R2 = 0.94) than the second degree (R2 = 0.81), for the human delta globin gene the statistics for the quadratic and cubic fits are R2 = 0.87 and R2 = 0.98 respectively. the origin of such a relationship as in equations 1 and 2 could be traced to mutational changes in a sequence. mutation event of cytosine to thymine in strand 1 can be considered to change the intra-pyrimidine difference, nC-T, in strand 1 and trigger a change in the intra-purine difference, nG-A, in strand 2. the two changes can be related by (4) where the first term on the right relates to the probability of the G to A change in strand 2 and the second term to the probability of the third type of response. Equations 16 and 17 are similar to equations 1 and 2 and conform to the general shapes of the sequence plots. this shows that the path traced out by the nucleotide sequence of a gene follows some pattern that can be ascribed to the accumulated effects of spot mutations over evolutionary time scales. re-establish the cytosine or replace the guanine with a thymine, or add a CG base pair to the DNA thus elongating it. this will reduce the nC-T(1) by 1 unit and also reduce the nG-A(2) by 1 unit as well as have a small probability of adding an extra guanine in strand 2 by virtue of the additional base pair. homologous sequences of conserved genes of the intronless or with-introns varieties have similar describing equations. the coefficients of the variables have similar order of magnitude values. this would seem to indicate that these gene sequences have inherent characteristics that are expressed by the parameters of the describing equations. the authors hypothesize that a template-directed restoration of ancestral DNA passed on in an RNA cache could underlie the mechanism of such reversion. the existence of such a mechanism that lies outside the DNA genome could lead to the high-frequency modification of DNA sequences in a template-directed manner. this could be indicative of the monitoring process hypothesized above also functioning irrespective of whether the sequences are intronless or intron-rich. the introns may have a role to play such as maintaining the structure of base arrangements so that the restrictions implied by the equations 16, 17 can continue to apply. if sustained, such a hypothesis could lend support to the intron late theory. the 2D plots of intra-purine versus intra-pyrimidine differences in conserved gene sequences exhibit an apparent pattern in base distribution. this is found over a wide cross section of sequences, from e.g., the members of the globin family, the histones, tubulins and heat shock proteins. this may arise from the non-symmetrical mutation repair mechanism where e.g., a cytosine mutating to thymine in a are extendible further to genomic sequences then it would imply that not all genetic modifications would be sustainable."}
