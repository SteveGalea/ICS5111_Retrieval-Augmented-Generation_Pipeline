{"summary": "hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a small, enveloped positive-sense RNA virus of the Flaviviridae family (Hepacivirus genus) since its discovery in 1989, HCV has been revealed as a primary cause of chronic hepatitis, end-stage cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) worldwide, an estimated 200 million persons (approximately 3% of the global population) are chronically infected many miRNAs regulate a wide range of biological processes, including development [10], cell differentiation [11], proliferation, and apoptosis [12]\u2013[14]. miR-21 was found to be more strongly expressed in HCC specimens than in non-tumorous tissues [23], and participates in HCC development by regulating the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten (PTEN) gene. miR-21 is upregulated upon RNA virus infection and acts as a negative regulator of type I IFN signaling. the mechanism involved in the regulation of miR-21 by HCV infection is still unknown. a random non-HCV-related miRNA (miR-93) was analyzed after HCV infection. human hepatocytes were infected with or without HCV for 12 h. expression of miR-21 was determined by qPCR. results are standardized to 1 in uninfected cells. the NS3/4A complex and NS5A protein exert the most stimulatory effects on the activation of the miR-21 promoter. qPCR analysis also showed that the NS3/4A complex and NS5A protein can enhance the expression of miR-21. the phosphorylation and total protein levels of c-Jun and c-Fos were determined by Western blot. all experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. AP-1 elements in miPPR-21 are crucial for NS5A and NS3/4A inducibility. mutations in the binding sites (f11\u2013f14) in miPPR-21 showed no significant effects. c-Jun and c-Fos were activated by NS5A in a time-dependent fashion. NS5A and NS3/4A proteins of HCV stimulate miR-21 expression through AP-1. but NS5A regulates miR-21 mainly through c-Jun and NS3/4A mediates miR-21 mainly through c-Fos. kinases regulate transcription factors that are important in regulation of AP-1 activation and expression. the results from luciferase activity assays showed that the miR-21 promoter activity induced by NS5A decreased significantly in the presence of SP600125 and GF10203. also, the miR-21 promoter activity up-regulated by NS3/4A was clearly repressed by U0126, PD98059, and GF10203. miR-21 expression was measured by qPCR (lower panel) cells were co-transfected with miPPR21 and dominant-negative mutants of ERK1 (mERK1), ERK2 (mERK2), JNK (mJNK) or control vectors at different concentrations. the role of ERK and JNK in the NS5A- and NS3/4A-mediated activation of miR-21 was further examined. the levels of phosphorylated JNK or phosphorylated ERK1/2 increased in a time-dependent fashion in the presence of NS5A or NS3/4A protein (Figure 4E) the levels of ERK1/2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by PD98059, U0126, and GF109203. the phosphorylation and total protein levels of c-Jun (C) and c-Fos (G) were determined by Western blot (upper panel), and miR-21 expression was measured by qPCR (lower paned) all experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. the PKC family has been shown to be involved in signal transduction associated with a wide range of biological responses. Western blot analyses were used to detect the phosphorylation or total protein levels of c-Jun or c-Fos induced by NS5A (Figure 4C, upper panel) or NS3/4A (Figure 4G, upper panel), respectively. the results confirmed the reduction seen in the corresponding luciferase reporter assays. miR-21 inhibitor is a synthetic oligonucleotide with exact sequence complementarity to miR-21. such inhibitor oligonucleotides have been shown to sequester intracellular miRNAs and to inhibit their activity in the RNA-interfering pathway. results are standardized to 1 in control cells. IFN- mRNA levels were determined by qPCR. the effects of pFL-J6/JFH5\u2032C19Rluc2AUbi on the induction of miR-21 and IFN- were equivalent to that of the JFH-1 HCV strain. the results showed that miR-21 overexpression reduced IFN- mRNA and protein levels in HCV-exposed cells. miR-21 regulates a range of responses to HCV infection in hepatocytes. hepatocytes were transfected with miR-21 and then infected with HCV (MOI = 1). miR-21 stimulates HCV replication and attenuates the HCV response to IFN- treatment. intracellular HCV RNA replicates (E) were quantified by qPCR. cells were transfected with miR-21 inhibitors or control inhibitor (ctrl) after 48 h, cells were infected with HCV (MOI = 1) for 2 h. qPCR, RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses elucidate the effects of miR-21 on IFNAR1/IFNAR2 expression. the antiviral IFN- response is downregulated by miR-21 in hepatocytes. hepatocytes were transfected with miR-21 mimics or control. the cells were treated with recombinant human IFN- (100 U/ml) or infected with Sendai virus (SeV) after 12 h, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2 mRNA and protein expression was determined by qPCR (A, B), RT-PCR (C) and Western blot analysis (D), respectively. miR-21 regulates the expression of components of the toll-like receptor 7 signaling cascade. the endosomal single-stranded RNA receptor uses the MyD88 adaptor protein to initiate IFN- synthesis via interleukin-1-receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) 1, IRAK4, tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor (TRAF6) and the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) 7 transcription factor. IRAK1, IRAK4, and TRAF6 mRNA levels were determined by qPCR (A, B, C, and D) and RT-PCR (E and F), respectively. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. IRF-7 promotes the expression of various IFN subtypes. miR-21 mimics decreased luciferase expression, whereas miR-21 inhibitors increased luciferase expression. miR-21 mimics also downregulated GFP gene expression when the 3\u2032-UTR of MyD88 or IRAK1 was cloned into the 3\u2032-UTR region of GFP. miR-21 regulates expression of MyD88 and IRAK1. hepatocytes were co-transfected with pGL3-Basic, pGL3-MyD88 3\u2032 UTR, or pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid. after 48 h, firefly luciferase activity was determined and normalized to Renilla luciferase activity. myD88 and IRAK1 protein levels were determined by Western blot and normalized to -actin (top panel); MyD88 and IRAK1 mRNA levels were determined by qPCR and normalized to -actin (bottom panel) similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. besides, HCV alone does, indeed, downregulate MyD88 and IRAK1 expression. virally induced miR-21 regulates IFN signaling through suppression of endogenous MyD88 and IRAK1. after 24 h, myD88 and IRAK1 mRNA levels were determined by qPCR. after 48 h, Huh7 hepatocytes were co-transfected with miR-21 mimic or control RNA and siRNA against MyD88 or IRAK1. production through the toll-like-interleukin-1 receptor domain-containing adaptor (TRIF) plays a crucial role in mounting an antiviral response against HCV. TRIF or IRF was knocked down in Huh7 cell lines. the level of IFN- protein was decreased by miR-21 and this regulation was not affected by treatment with TRIF or IRF3 siRNA compared to the control. the results from the luciferase assays showed that HIV-1 transcription was induced in the presence of miR-21. miR-21 counteracted the IFN- anti-HIV activity (Figure 11B, right panel) RD cells were infected with EV71 (MOI = 1) for 6 h. PBMCs were transfected with pNL-luc-E-R+ plasmids for 48 h. miR-21 expression was determined by qPCR. the results from quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) analysis showed that miR-21 levels were increased in human Huh7 hepatocytes 1 h after infection HCV strain JFH-1. this response was dose-dependent (Figure 1B) to understand the kinetics of miR-21 induction in HCV infection. qPCR showed that miR-21 levels were significantly reduced in the presence of si-HCV. the NS3/4A complex and NS5A protein exert the most stimulatory effects on the activation of the miR-21 promoter. Huh7 cells were co-transfected with miR-21-luciferase reporter plasmid (miPPR-21) and the plasmids encoding each of the 11 HCV proteins. the activity of the miR-21 promoter was measured by luciferase activity assays. nuclear factor I (NFI), signal recognition particle (SRP), the p53 transcription factor (p53) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) were fused to the 5\u2032 end of the firefly luciferase gene. full-length miPPR-21 displays clear NS5A or NS3/4A inducibility, which is decreased by truncations of this promoter region. blot analysis was used to determine expression levels of c-Jun and c-Fos. levels of both phosphorylated and total c-Jun, but not c-Fos, were activated by NS5A in a time-dependent fashion. results suggested that the NS5A and NS3/4A proteins may stimulate the miR-21 expression through the same AP-1 element site. MAPK family regulate transcription factors that are important in the regulation of AP-1 activation and expression. NS5A-regulated activation and NS3/4A-regulated activation of miR-21 required c-Jun and c-Fos respectively. we investigated the roles of kinases and the molecular mechanisms underlying this event. phosphorylation and total protein levels of c-Jun and c-Fos were measured. corresponding decrease in expression level of miR-21 stimulated by NS5A or NS3/4A. kinase-inactive mutants of ERK or JNK (mERK1, mERK2, and mJNK) were co-transfected with pCMV-NS5A or pCMV-NS3/4A, miPPR-21, and each of the three kinase mutants. reporter gene expression, measured as luciferase activity, was reduced by the ERK or ERK mutants in cells transfected with K1/2 phosphorylation was significantly reduced by PD98059, U0126, and GF109203. phosphorylation induced by the two HCV proteins is dependent on the PKC transduction pathway. all experiments were repeated at least three times with similar results. NS5A and NS3/4A-activated ERK and JNK were dependent on PKC. we extended our study to identify specific isozymes of PKC involved in the activation of miR-21. blot analysis showed that phosphorylated JNK levels stimulated by the NS5A protein were significantly decreased upon treatment with PKC-specific siRNA (PKC RNAi) all of these results suggested that PKC is the upstream kinase involved in NS3/4A-induced ERK/c-Fos activation. miR-21 suppresses HCV-triggered type I IFN production in hepatocytes. the miR-21 mimics increased miR-21 expression significantly in Huh7 hepatocytes, whereas miR-21 inhibitors decreased miR-21 expression. time course analysis revealed that IFN- was rapidly induced, reaching peak concentrations within 12 h. the cells were transfected with pFL-J6/JFH5\u2032C19Rluc2AUbi (0.1 g) after 48 h. the effects of pFL-J6/JFH5\u2032C19Rluc2AUbi were equivalent to that of the JFH-1 HCV strain. miR-21 overexpression reduced IFN- mRNA and protein levels in HCV-exposed cells. miR-21 inhibitors caused a modest but reproducible enhancement of IFN- expression. miR-21 inhibits the production of type I IFN. Huh7 hepatocytes were transfected with control RNA (miR-ctrl) or miR-21 mimics. after 48 h, cells were infected with HCV (MOI = 1) for 2 h. after 72 h, intracellular HCV RNA replicates were quantified by qPCR. cell culture medium, and supernatant HCV replicates (D) were quantified by qPCR using qPCR using GAPDH as internal control. similar results were obtained in three independent experiments. qPCR, RT-PCR, and Western blot analyses were used to elucidate the effects of miR-21 on IFNAR1/IFNAR2 expression. the antiviral IFN- response is downregulated by miR-21 in hepatocytes. signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins are transcription factors that are important in IFN signaling. genetic defects in STAT-1 result in death by viral disease at an early age. mRNA levels of myD88, IRAK1, IRAK4 and TRAF6 were decreased by miR-21 overexpression and increased by miR-21 inhibition. we also evaluated the gene expression of TLR7 in the same experimental samples using qPCR and reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. miR-21 mimic could not activate TLR7 signaling as ssRNA. qPCR (Figure S5A) and RT-PCR (Figure S5B) results showed that levels of IRF-7 mRNA were decreased upon treatment with miR-21 and increased upon treatment with miR-21 inhibitor. results suggest that miR-21 mediates host antiviral responses by suppressing expression of genes involved in the TLR signaling cascade. luciferase reporter plasmids were co-transfected with pGL3-Basic, pGL3-MyD88 3\u2032 U. miR-21 mimics decreased luciferase expression, whereas miR-21 inhibitors increased luciferase expression. miR-21 mimics also downregulated GFP gene expression. firefly luciferase reporter plasmids (80 ng) and pRL-TK Renilla luciferase plasmid (40 ng) were co-transfected with GFP control, GFP-MyD88 3\u2032 UTR, or GFP-IRAK1 3\u2032 UTR plasmid (400 ng) after 48 h, GFP expression was analyzed by FACS. regulation of IFN signaling by miR-21 is mediated by MyD88 and IRAK1. small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) effectively inhibited MyD88 and IRAK1 expression in Huh7 cells. knockdown of MyD88 or IRAK1 significantly decreased levels of IFN- mRNA and protein. Huh7 hepatocytes were co-transfected with miR-21 mimic or control RNA and siRNA against MyD88 or IRAK1. after 48 h, Huh7 cells were transfected with FL-J6/JFH5\u2032C19Rluc2AUbi (0.1 g) for the indicated time, and IFN- expression and secretion were determined by qPCR and ELISA. miR-21 enhances the replication and production of other viruses by hampering the antiviral activity of IFN- because miR-21 disrupts antiviral function by inhibiting type I IFN-. miR-21 effectively stimulated viral VP1 mRNA and protein levels. PBMCs were co-transfected with pNL4-3.luc.R-E- and miR-21 mimics or control RNA for 24 h and treated with or without IFN- (100 U/ml) after 24 h, cells were infected with VSV (MOI = 1) for 2 h and washed before treatment with or without IFN- (100 U/ml) miR-21 activates replication of EV71, HIV-1, and VSV by suppressing the antiviral activity of IFN-. qPCR results indicated that the levels of miR-21 were induced significantly by both HIV-1 and VSV. inhibition of miR-21 also increases cell growth in other cancer types [49] and exerts anti-apoptotic effects in glioblastoma and cholangiocarcinoma [51], [51]. AP-1 is at least partially responsible for the upregulation of miR-21. AP-1 is essential for NS5A and NS3/4A protein-induced miR-21 expression. mutations in AP-1 binding sites eliminated the protein-induced activation of miR-21 promoter activity. results suggest ERK, JNK, and PKC were all involved in the activation of miR-21 by the two proteins. miR-21 attenuated expression of the IFN-stimulated genes PKR, Mx, and OAS. miR-21 decreased STAT1/STAT2 phosphorylation, but had little effect on total STAT protein levels. miR-21 overexpression reduced IFNARs expression. suppression of myD88 and IRAK1 by inducible miR-21 attenuates antiviral immunity and renders the immune response less effective. measles virus and respiratory syncytial virus inhibit TLR7-dependent and TLR9-dependent IFN signaling stimulated by resiquimod and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides. miR-21 expression may not be required after EV71 infection. the host response is the first line of immune defense against viral pathogens. a single miRNA might fine-tune the protein synthesis of thousands of genes directly or indirectly. the functional mechanism of miR-21 action through MyD88 and IRAK1 could be another mechanism independent pathway of the TRIF pathway for impairing the type I IFN-associated antiviral response during HCV infection. the virus is first recognized by TLRs and RIG-1, which in turn activates MyD88 and IRAK1 to initiate IFN-synthesis. the two subunits (c-Jun and c-Fos) of AP-1 join together to recognize the miR-21 promoter and activate the expression of miR-21. reduction in myD88 and IRAK1 causes a reduction of type-I IFN production and ISG expression that might contribute to viral pathogenesis and virus propagation. 2, H-89, Sp600125, U0126, PD98059, SB203580, MG132 and GF10203 were purchased form Tocris Bioscience (Tocris Bioscience, Missouri, USA) ALL of the inhibitors were dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO; Sigma, Abitibi belt, Canada) the RNAi vectors were constructed by ligating the pairs of oligonucleotides to pSilencer 2.0 (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, USA) based on the sequences described by Storz et al. stock virus was prepared by collecting and filtering the cell culture supernatant.
