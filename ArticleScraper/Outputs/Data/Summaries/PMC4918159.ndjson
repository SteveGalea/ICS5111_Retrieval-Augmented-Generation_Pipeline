{"summary": "strategies for potential use of MERS-CoV medical countermeasures MERS-CoV infection could theoretically be prevented by vaccination, pre- or postexposure antiviral chemoprophylaxis, or passive immunoprophylaxis of persons in affected countries. therapeutic drugs with specific activity against MERS-CoV could be used for treatment of human illness caused by MERS-CoV infection or for pre- or postexposure prophylaxis. studies in mice, both dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4 or cluster differentiation 26) transduced and transgenic, and in rabbits, hamsters, and ferrets have been reviewed elsewhere (16,20,21) these small animal models have been used for screening potential MERS-CoV medical countermeasures. NIAID Rocky Mountain Laboratories Marmoset Wild-type MERS-CoV spike protein binds wild-type marmoset DPP4\u2019 multiple routes of infection used. common marmosets appear to be better suited than rhesus macaques for therapeutic studies. virology and immunology of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries, a natural host, has been reported in Qatar (28) major gaps for animal models include lack of consensus and availability of the optimal animal model to replicate severe human illness from MERS-CoV infection. competition for funding, laboratory space, availability of animals and expertise with emerging or reemerging infectious diseases. the CDC made this test available to multiple US public health laboratories, the US Department of Defense, and WHO laboratories worldwide. it is limited in terms of the CDC\u2019s ability to scale up the supply of reagents to support a surge in MERS-CoV cases in the united states and in other countries where the test has been made available. the lack of commercial development of MERS-CoV assays may be partly related to the limited availability of clinical specimens and MERS-CoV isolates from infected patients. serologic tests can be used to confirm MERS-CoV infection when viral shedding is not detectable.

Ongoing assessment of antigenic evolution of circulating MERS-CoV strains is essential for informing vaccine a concern that must be addressed in the development of MERS-CoV vaccines is the potential for causing antibody-dependent enhancement of disease upon virus challenge. the lack of a precedent of coronavirus vaccines for humans poses another challenge for the evaluation of MERS-CoV vaccines for humans. a modified vaccinia virus Ankara vaccine that expresses the MERS-CoV spike protein was administered intranasally and intramuscularly to dromedaries. vaccinated dromedaries had fewer signs of respiratory infection and lower MERS-CoV titers in the upper respiratory tract compared with unvaccinated dromedaries. alpacas (New World camelids) are being investigated as a suitable proxy for camels most candidate vaccines are still being evaluated in animal models. they have generally targeted the spike protein of MERS-CoV and are recombinant virus, subunit, DNA, or virus-like vector vaccines. one live-attenuated MERS-CoV candidate vaccine is in early development (66) a concern that must be addressed in the development of MERS-CoV vaccines is the potential for causing antibody-dependent enhancement of disease upon virus challenge. the lack of a precedent of coronavirus vaccines for humans poses another challenge for the evaluation of MERS-CoV vaccines for humans. a major challenge to this approach is that dromedaries can be reinfected with MERS-CoV. a study by Farag et al. found no correlation between MERS-CoV RNA levels and neutralizing antibodies in camels. a camel vaccination strategy may require multiple dosing and booster vaccination. the most appropriate approval pathway is likely to be product-specific and will require consideration of existing product data. the most appropriate approval pathway is likely to be product-specific and will require consideration of existing product data, proposed intended use and population for use. an emergency use authorization can be obtained through sources such as investigational new drug clinical trials. the current emergency use authorization pathway serves as a fast approach to make products available for emergency public health purposes. the current emergency use authorization pathway serves as a fast approach to make products available for public health purposes. clinical data on some MERS-CoV patients has been published in case series (58,78,79) there is a need for much more epidemiologic, clinical, virologic, and immunologic data to improve the limited understanding of the pathogenesis of MERS-CoV infection in humans. WHO and the international severe acute Respiratory and Emerging Infection Consortium are collaborating in adapting protocols for controlled clinical trials for MERS-CoV (82). there is uncertainty in estimating timelines for the development of potential MERS-CoV medical countermeasures because of the need to further characterize existing and new animal models. capabilities in areas where the virus is endemic among dromedaries are critical elements of effective MERS-CoV medical countermeasures development. results of substantial progress in establishing the infrastructure and platforms for preclinical and advanced clinical development of countermeasures can serve as a model."}
