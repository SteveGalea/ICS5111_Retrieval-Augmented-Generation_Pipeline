{"summary": "interleukin (IL)-10 maintains this balance by dampening aspects of both innate and adaptive immunity [1]\u2013[4] IL-10 blocks the production of proinflammatory cytokines during the resolution period of infection. IL-10 also alters the function of antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells and macrophages by limiting expression of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules. cytopathic herpesvirus replicates at high levels in the spleen and liver. early acute MCMV infection induces rapid mobilization of NK cells and monocyte/macrophages into infected liver sites. NK cell cytotoxicity and production of antiviral cytokines limits MCMV infection in the liver. further work has described a role for IL-10 in reducing systemic IFN- production, CD4+ and CD8+ T cell cytokine responses and viral elimination in the spleen during MCMV infection. NK cells have been implicated as sources of IL-10 in MCMV-infected perforin-deficient mice and have been suggested to restrain exaggerated CD8+ T cell responses. conditioned media were prepared from liver leukocytes isolated from mice uninfected or infected with MCMV. IL-10 protein levels were slightly increased on day 3 but peaked significantly at day 4 after infection. by days 5 and 7 post infection, the levels of IL-10 produced were reduced as compared to day 4. liver leukocytes from uninfected tiger mice marginally expressed IL-10/GFP. after infection, 10%1% of the gated leukocytes were IL-10/GFP+. IL-10/GFP+ liver leukocytes were then characterized by their expression of NK1.1 and TCR. characterization of IL-10/GFP+ TCR+ cells demonstrated that these T cells were comprised of both CD8+ and CD4+ cells. these results demonstrate that during acute MCMV infection, several cell types contribute IL-10 in the liver, most of which are mature and activated NK cells. cytokine and chemokine production is amplified in absence of IL-10 during MCMV infection. effects of IL-10 deficiency on systemic and local production of key inflammatory mediators during this infection were evaluated. ELISA was used to assess the levels of IFN-, TNF-, and CXCL9 proteins in liver leukocyte conditioned media supernatants prepared from uninfected or MCMV-infected mice. cytokine production by liver leukocytes during MCMV infection is similarly augmented in the absence of IL-10. IL-10 deficiency enhances the accumulation of inflammatory effector cells in the liver during MCMV infection. the effects of IL-10 in the liver appear limited to suppression of IFN- and CXCL9. the findings in Figure 3 show that IL-10 deficiency results in increased local proinflammatory cytokine production. the mean cell numbers per gram liver SE for (B) NK cells (NKp46+ TCR), (C) macrophages (F4/80+ CD11b+), (D) CD4+ T cells (CD4+ TCR+) and (E) CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TCR+) were performed for time points indicated. the numbers of CD8+ T cells found in IL-10/ livers were comparable to WT. the numbers of macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells in IL-10/ livers were still higher. IL-10 regulates the persistence of effector cells in the liver. e of MCMV, an H-2Db viral peptide derived from the MCMV M45 protein [41]\u2013[43]. the frequencies and total numbers of antigen-specific IFN- and TNF- producing CD8+ T cells were determined by intracellular staining for these cytokines. IL-10/ mice exhibited decreased frequencies of both IFN-+ and TNF-+ CD8+ T cells on day 7 post infection. results show frequencies total numbers of CD8+ T cells expressing (A and B) IFN- or (C and D) TNF-. data are combined from three independent experiments. IL-10 deficiency increases hepatic immunopathology during MCMV infection. inflammatory foci were quantified in a 400 m2 total liver area from 8 fields of view (FOV), each with a square area of 50um2 at a magnification of 200. data were combined from at least three independent experiments with n = 4\u201311 mice per group. PAS staining has been used as an indicator of liver function or glycogen storage. on day 4 post infection, both WT and IL-10/ livers had comparable reductions in PAS staining. however, the extent of positive PAS staining in liver sections from day 7 infected IL-10/ and WT mice were comparable. uninfected or (C, D, G, H, I, J, K, L) infected with MCMV for 5 days were harvested, paraffin embedded, and sectioned for PAS staining. inflammatory foci (arrows, C, D, G & H), necrosis (asterisks, G and I), councilman bodies (black arrowheads, H), are marked. IL-10 minimizes immunopathology during acute MCMV infection without affecting viral clearance in the liver. results shown are the means SE of cumulative data from two independent experiments (n = 4\u20139 mice per group for each time point tested) conditioned media were prepared from liver leukocytes isolated from mice uninfected or infected with MCMV. IL-10 protein levels were slightly increased on day 3 but peaked significantly at day 4 after infection. by days 5 and 7 post infection, levels of IL-10 produced were reduced as compared to day 4 after infection. liver leukocytes from uninfected tiger mice marginally expressed IL-10/GFP. after infection, 10%1% of the gated leukocytes were IL-10/GFP+.

NK1.1TCR+ (frequency and numbers), NK1.1+ TCR+ vs. NK1.1 TCR+ (frequency and number) and NK1.1 TCR+ (frequency only) effects of IL-10 deficiency on systemic and local production of key inflammatory mediators during MCMV infection were evaluated. ELISA was used to assess the levels of IFN-, TNF-, and CXCL9 proteins in liver leukocyte conditioned media supernatants prepared from uninfected or MCMV-infected mice. cytokine production by liver leukocytes during MCMV infection is similarly augmented in the absence of IL-10. IL-10 deficiency suppresses the production of systemic inflammatory cytokines during MCMV infection. effects of IL-10 in the liver appear limited to suppression of IFN- and CXCL9. cytokine response could be attributed to presence of inflammatory effector leukocytes in infected IL-10 deficient livers. Flow cytometry of effector cell populations was performed for time points indicated. the mean cell numbers per gram liver SE for (B) NK cells (NKp46+ TCR), (C) macrophages (F4/80+ CD11b+), (D) CD4+ T cells (CD4+ TCR+) and (E) CD8+ T cells (CD8+ TCR+) were shown. the numbers of CD8+ T cells found in IL-10/ livers were comparable to WT. the numbers of macrophages, CD4+ T cells, and NK cells in IL-10/ livers were still higher. IL-10 regulates the persistence of effector cells in the liver. IL-10/ mice showed decreased frequencies of both IFN-+ and TNF-+ CD8+ T cells on day 7 post infection. despite these differences on day 5, the numbers of both IFN-+ and TNF-+ CD8+ T cells in IL-10/ livers were comparable to those in WT. results show frequencies total numbers of CD8+ T cells expressing (A and B) IFN- or (C and D) TNF-. data are combined from three independent experiments. IL-10 deficiency increases hepatic immunopathology during MCMV infection. inflammatory foci in MCMV infected C57BL/6J and IL-10/ livers. days post MCMV infection No. of foci counted a No. of nucleated cells per focus b WT IL-10/ WT IL-10/ 0 - - - - - 4 92 121 - - 5 112 231a 414 >60c. PAS staining has been used as an indicator of liver function or glycogen storage. on day 4 post infection, both WT and IL-10/ livers had comparable reductions in PAS staining. however, the extent of positive PAS staining in liver sections from day 7 infected IL-10/ and WT mice were comparable. infected IL-10/ mice were harvested, paraffin embedded, and sectioned for PAS staining. inflammatory foci (arrows, C, D, G & H), necrosis (asterisks, G and I), councilman bodies are marked. extent of liver damage in infected IL-10/ mice was also assessed. IL-10 minimizes immunopathology during acute MCMV infection without affecting viral clearance in the liver. results shown are the means SE of cumulative data from two independent experiments (n = 4\u20139 mice per group for each time point tested) IL-10 is produced in the liver during acute MCMV infection. the absence of IL-10 during acute infection results in inflated proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine production and accumulation of inflammatory cells in infected livers. these unrestrained inflammatory responses promote the development of liver injury, but do not enhance viral elimination at this site. MCMV-specific, effector CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells contribute IL-10 in the liver during this infection. further studies are necessary to delineate IL-10+ cells within the NK1.1 TCR population and the TCR+ population. this may also contribute to the regulation of inflammation in the liver during infection. studies have associated liver production of IFN- and CXCL9 with recruitment of MCMV-specific CD8+ T cells to the liver during MCMV infection. increased cellular accumulation in IL-10/ livers may also reflect the broad immunosuppressive impact of IL-10 on cellular activation and proliferation [1]\u2013[5]. IL-10 dampens macrophage proliferation and T cell priming [1], [4], [6], [7], and during acute MCMV infection, IL IL-10 suppresses MCMV elimination in the spleen and salivary glands. lack of improved clearance in IL-10 deficient livers could be attributed to activity of other immunoregulatory mechanisms such as programmed death-1(PD-1)-PD-L1 (PD ligand-1) or Tim-3-galectin-9. IL-10 and cellular sources of IL-10 protect liver from damage due to infection induced inflammatory responses. all animal work was approved by the Brown University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. all mice were maintained in pathogen-free mouse facilities at Brown University. Plaques were counted to calculate viral titers as previously described. isolated leukocytes were plated without additional stimulation in round-bottom microtiter plates at 106 cells/well in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) all antibodies, except for anti-F4/80 (AbD Serotec), were obtained from BD Biosciences or eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA), unless otherwise noted. all antibodies, except for anti-F4/80, were obtained from BD Biosciences or eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) leukocytes were stained with PE-Cy7- or PerCP-conjugated anti-CD8. cells were incubated with PE-conjugated anti-mouse IFN- (clone XMG1.2), APC-conjugated anti-TNF- (clone MP6-XT22), or isotype control IgG1 (BD Biosciences). the number of nucleated cells per inflammatory focus was determined by counting cells within 20 random foci per representative H&E stained liver section at a magnification of 400. images were photographed with a DP70 digital camera and software (Optical Analysis Corporation, Nashua, NH, USA) IL-10-internal ribosome entry site (IRES) green fluorescence protein knockin (GFP) knockin (IL-10-IRES-GFP) reporter tiger mice were generated as described in [65] and bred in pathogen-free mouse facilities at Brown University. age- (6\u20138 week old) and sex-matched mice were used in all experiments. fetal calf serum was supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Atlanta Biologicals) after 24 h of incubation at 37\u00b0C, cell free supernatants were collected and stored at 20\u00b0C until further use in cytokine analyses. all antibodies, except for anti-F4/80 (AbD Serotec), were obtained from BD Biosciences or eBioscience (San Diego, CA, USA) where indicated, GFP expression in leukocytes from tiger mice was analyzed in the FITC/FL1 channel. anti-TNF- (clone MP6-XT22), or isotype control IgG1 (BD Biosciences), were used to correct for background fluorescence and set analysis gates. cells were acquired and analyzed using FACSCalibur and CellQuest-Pro software. p values of 0.05 were considered significant and denoted with a \u201c#\u201d for multiple comparisons. differences between IL-10 and IL-10/ groups in cell number, cytokine levels for serum and liver leukocyte conditioned media, foci number, and serum ALT levels were determined by Student's T tests."}
