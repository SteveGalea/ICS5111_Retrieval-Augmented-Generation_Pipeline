{"summary": "Query raised in clinics Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes pulmonary thromboembolism (PE) and deep venous thrombosis (DVT) the incidence of genetic VTE is relatively low, while most of the VTEs are acquired VTEs. both can be called symptomatic VTE, when hard to be distinguished. the vast majority of the population will not develop VTE in the same conditions. acute arterial thrombus is white thrombus, while acute venous thrombus is red thrombus. venous thrombosis can autolyze, while arterial thrombosis cannot. acute venous thrombosis is red thrombus, which is composed of red blood cells, platelets, white blood cells and fibrinogen. reversible combinations between fibrinogen and their ligand proteins explain that acute venous thrombus is easy to autolyze, delayed thrombolysis is effective. in the same group, the subunit is identical, but the subunit is distinct. at rest, the subunit is covered by the subunit and thus the integrin is unable to bind to ligands. the subunit mediates the specific and reversible binding between integrins and their ligands. ligand includes fibrinogen, fibronectin, vitronectin, vWF and thrombospondin. immunohistochemistry showed dark-brown integrin 1 was expressed on the lymphocytes. no expression of laminin, fibronectin, collagen-I and collagen-II was observed on the lymphocytes. people invented different types of artificial vena caval filter used in clinics. the mechanism is preventing the genesis of PE by blocking the deep venous thrombi flowing back to pulmonary arteries through the filter. the construction of intravenous biological filter is the result of self-regulation of human body. the human body needed to build a new intravenous defense line. the immune system existed inside human body is the immune system. it is the function of immune system that removing all the foreign agents inside human body. phagocytes, NK cells, complement system and cytokine related gene expressions in both PE group and control group were compared. mRNA expressions of pattern recognition receptors (TLR2, TLR4, CD14, MYD88, MRC1L1, MRC2, MSR1, SCARA5, SCARB2, SCARF1 and SCARF2) and opsonic receptors (CR1, FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR3A and FCGR3B) seven genes of the complement late components were detected. expression levels of genes encoding IFN5, IFN6, IFN8, IFN14, IFN, IFN1 and IFN1 were significantly lower than those detected in PBMCs from controls. of 12 genes were downregulated specifically IL1A, IL9, IL17B, IL19, IL23A and IL25 (P0.05), IL2, IL3, IL13, IL22, IL24 and IL31 (P0.01) in the PE patients, mRNA expression levels of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl6, Cxcl13 and Cxcl14 were significantly upregulated. eight genes associated with transforming growth factor (TGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were detected. the mRNA expression levels of TGF1, TGF 1-induced transcript 1, EGF and VEGF were significantly upregulated (P0.01) in PE patients compared with controls. integrins 1 and 2 mRNAs expressions were upregulated in the PE group. mRNA expressions of 82 genes involved in B cell activation were detected. mRNA expressions of LYN, CD22, SYK, BTK, PTPRC and NFAM1 were significantly higher. expressions of genes including CR1, LILRB4 and VAV1 were significantly up-regulated in PE patients compared with the control group. expressions of genes including CR1, LILRB4 and VAV1 were significantly higher, whereas expression of SLAMF7 was significantly lower than those in the control group. hyaline thrombus (thick arrow), mixed thrombus (thin arrow) and red thrombus (open arrow) HE100; D. Renal interstitium: mixed thrombi (arrow) composed of fibrin, platelets and red blood cells. decreasedCD3 and CD8 levels, and increased CD4/CD8 ratio, were similar to those in acute PE [29] VTE and hemorrhage serve as inevitable products in proliferation of cancer cells and disruption of surrounded veins and arteries. Necrotic region in poorly differentiated gastric carcinoma presented with exudation of a large number of red blood cells. integrin 2 expression in thrombi increased significantly in patients with acute infection, malignancy and autoimmune diseases. however, no same elevation of protein expression was found in patients with different risk factors (acute infection, malignancy and autoimmune diseases, trauma/surgery group) sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value of integrin 1 were 80.3%, 83.7%, 71.1% and 89.3%, respectively. integrin 2 78.6%, 73.7%, 59.4% and 87.6%, respectively. core proteins in acute venous thrombus are integrin 1, integrin 2 and integrin 3. integrin 1 is the characterized expression in people with risk factors of VTE. however this increased expression of integrin 1, 2, 3 was not found in patients following trauma or surgery calling into question that such patients may have no VTE risk. reversible combinations between fibrinogen and their ligand proteins explain that acute venous thrombus is easy to autolyze, delayed thrombolysis is effective, and it is easy to lyse the thrombus through interventional fragmentation. subunits 1, 2 and 3 in integrins were the core proteins of thrombus. integrin is a transmembrane heterodimer composed of subunits and at a ratio of 1:1. at rest, the subunit is covered by the subunit and thus the integrin is unable to bind to ligands. immunohistochemistry showed dark-brown integrin 1 was expressed on lymphocytes. no expression of laminin, fibronectin, collagen-I and collagen-II was observed on the lymphocytes. dark-brown integrin 3 was expressed on platelets which aggregated to be thrombotic skeleton and coral-like structure. thrombi, integrin 2 and 3, bind their ligand fibrinogen to construct mesh structure. mesh structure becomes a nest-like filter in thrombi. author found biological filter in veins of sigmoid colon adenocarcinoma tissues. the immune system can be divided into innate immune system and adaptive immune system. the adaptive immunity is acquired after birth with a characteristic of having memories, which can specifically attack the same invasive foreign agents. the adaptive immunity is also named specific immunity, which functions mainly through T and B lymphocytes. phagocytes, NK cells, complement system and cytokine related gene expressions in both PE group and control group were compared. mRNA expressions of pattern recognition receptors (TLR2, TLR4, CD14, MYD88, MRC1L1, MRC2, MSR1, SCARA5, SCARB2, SCARF1 and SCARF2) and opsonic receptors (CR1, FCGR2A, FCGR2B, FCGR3A and FCGR3B) expression levels of all the seven genes mRNAs were up-regulated. expression levels of 12 genes were downregulated specifically IL1A, IL9, IL17B, IL19, IL23A and IL25 (P0.05), IL2, IL3, IL13, IL22, IL24 and IL31. mRNA expression levels of Cxcl1, Cxcl2, Cxcl6, Cxcl13 and Cxcl14 were significantly upregulated (P0.05), and Cxcl10 mRNA expression levels were significantly downregulated compared with controls (P0.01) mRNA expression levels of CC chemokines were significantly lower in PE patients than controls. GF1, TGF 1-induced transcript 1, EGF and VEGF were significantly upregulated (P0.01), whereas TGF 3 mRNA was significantly downregulated (P0.05) in PE patients. the expression of mRNAs located on leukocytes and platelets was significantly upregulated. mRNA expressions of 82 genes involved in B cell activation were detected. mRNA expressions of LYN, CD22, SYK, BTK, PTPRC and NFAM1 were significantly higher, whereas expressions of FYN, FCRL4 and LAX1 were significantly lower than the control group. expressions of genes including LTA and IL10 were significantly higher. expressions of IFNA5, IFNA6, IFNA8, IFNA14, IL2, IL13 and IFNG were significantly lower than those in the control group. the risk for DVT was increased by 1.91 folds within two weeks to six months after acute infection. malignancy is one of the leading causes of death in patients with malignancy. prevalence of VTE in patients with malignancy is 4-7 times higher than that of patients without malignancy. cell is the key of immune cells, which regulate the cellular immunity, humoral immunity, and phagocyte functions in innate immunity through Th1, Th2 and Th17. different immune functioning status, including normal, decreased and disturbed immune functioning status, decides different body status. the collapse of the balancing functions of immune cells indicates that immune cells in the innate and adaptive system have a state of no function or dysfunction. integrin 2 expression in patients with different risk factors was not significantly different. compared with control group, the integrin 3 expression in VTE group was elevated. integrin 2, 3 are the protein to distinguish patient with VTE from patient with risk factors. integrin 2 78.6%, 73.7%, 59.4% and 87.6%; integrin 3 68.4%, 71.2%, 54.3% and 81.8%. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 84.6%, 90.8%, 81.7% and 92.0% respectively. integrin 1 is the characterized expression in people with risk factors of VTE. however this increased expression of integrin 1 was not found in patients following trauma or surgery calling into question that such patients may have no VTE risk. trauma or surgery may be not the \u201ctrue\u201d risk factor for VTE."}
