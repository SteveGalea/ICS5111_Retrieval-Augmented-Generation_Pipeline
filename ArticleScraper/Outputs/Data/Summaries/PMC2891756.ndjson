{"summary": "76.5% of the respondents currently avoided going out or visiting crowded places or hospitals. 15% felt much worried about contracting H1N1 and 6% showed signs of emotional distress. women, older respondents, those having unconfirmed beliefs about modes of transmissions were more likely to adopt some avoidance behaviors. as of June 27, 2009, there are 629 confirmed cases in Hong Kong. no H1N1-related death was recorded and as of february 10, 2010 there were 67 H1N1-related deaths. a loss of HK$15 billion in spending on goods and services was attributable to the epidemic. community responses to the H1N1 pandemic are likely to be country-specific, possibly determined by previous experiences of epidemics such as SARS, the health system, risk communication patterns and even culture. a few other studies have investigated community's attitudinal and behavioral responses toward the early phase of the H1N1 pandemic in countries such as the united states. the first local community-infected case with an unknown source of infection was reported on June 11, 2009. random telephone numbers were selected from an up-to-date telephone directory. over 95% of households in Hong Kong have a fix-line telephone at home. 'avoided going out', 'avoided visiting crowded places' and 3) 'avoided visiting hospitals', and exhibition of negative psychological responses. 'panicking very much' or 'felt much depressed' due to H1N1. proportions of male and female of age 18-60 in Hong Kong were respectively 46.02% and 53.98%. proportions of the 4 age groups in Hong Kong (30, 30-39, 40-49, and 50-60) were respectively 24.75%, 23.78%, 27.33%, and 24.14%. #Less than 0.5% missing cases exist for the listed variables. overall average evaluation score 5 10.7% >5 - 8 69.1% >8 20.2% Perceived availability of treatment There is no effective drug for the treatment of H1N1 38.9% Risk perception Perceived severity of H1N1 High fatality 20.6% Severe irreversible body damages 18.9% Perceived chance of having a large scale H1N1 outbreak in Hong Kong in the future year. random telephone numbers were selected from an up-to-date telephone directory and the last two digits of the selected telephone number were randomized to include some unlisted telephone numbers. over 95% of households in Hong Kong have a fix-line telephone at home. 1,621 eligible households were invited to join the study. 95 (5.9%) could not be contacted after 3 attempts. 525 (32.4%) refused to join or withdraw from the study. 999 (61.6%) participated in the study. %# Socio - demographic characteristics Gender Male 43.4% Female 56.6% Age 30 25.0% 30 - 39 20.1% 40 - 49 27.1% 50 - 60 27.7% Education level Form 3 or below 18.5% Form 4 - matriculation 46.4% College or above 35.1% Marital status Single 33.5% Married/cohabited 65.0% Divorced/widowed 1.5% Full-time employed No 44.0% Yes 1.9% *Basing on end-2008 local health system do not have enough vaccine for preventing H1N1 36.2% Hospitals in Hong Kong do not have enough personal protection equipments for preventing H1N1 30.2% Any one of the above 52.6% Perceived ability to control the epidemic Hong Kong will be able to control a large-scale H1N1 outbreak 79.5% Any one of the above 92.3% Evaluation of governmental performance. 63.4% Any of the above 76.5% Negative psychological responses Worry for contracting H1N1 Respondent worrying himself/herself would contract the disease 11.7% Respondent worrying his/her family members would contract the disease 15.3% Emotional distress Feeling much in panic 4.4% Feeling much depressed 2.2% Feeling much emotionally disturbed 3.4% Any of the above 6.0% #Less than 2% missing cases exist for the listed variables. 8% of the respondents correctly knew that H1N1 is transmittable via droplets, touching the body of infected person or contaminated objects. about 60.3% were correct in all these three items (Table 2). Evaluation of governmental preparedness and performance in dealing with H1N1 Around 30-40% of all respondents believed that the local health system did not have enough medication (36.2%), vaccine (41.1%) or personal protection equipments (30.2%) to deal with the H1N1 epidemic. around 15% (15.8%) of the respondents were worried either they or their family members would contract H1N1. 6.0% showed signs of emotional distress (i.e. panicking very much or felt much depressed or were very much emotionally disturbed due to H1N1) Factors Associated with avoidance behaviors Females, older respondents, those with >= 1 unconfirmed beliefs about modes of H1N1 transmission. 1.00 1 - 30 - 39 53.7 1.89** 1.81 (1.22 - 2.69)** 44.8 2.00*** 2.17 (1.41 - 3.33)*** - - 40 - 49 55.9 2.07*** 2.14 (1.48 - 3.10)*** 42.8 1.85** 2.09 (1.41 - 3.11)*** - - 50 - 60 70.0 3.81*** 3.90 (2.67 - 5.70)*** 58.3 3.46*** 3. 1 37.9 1.00 1 59.2 1.00 NS All items being correct 59.2 1.56** 1.42 (1.08 - 1.87)* 47.9 1.51** 1.43 (1.08 - 1.88)* 66.3 1.35* Evaluation of governmental preparedness and performance in dealing with H1N1 Inadequacy of government preparation (health system) None - - - 40.5 1.00 NS - - - At least one of the three items the disease could be airborne across a long distance (e.g. from one building to another one); transmitted via water sources (e.g. reservoirs); transmitted via insect bites; transmitted via well-cooked pork. the disease could be transmitted via droplets (e.g. sneeze); transmitted via touching body of infected person; transmitted via touching contaminated objects. an average score was calculated for the 6 item scores. females, older respondents, those with >= 1 unconfirmed beliefs about modes of H1N1 transmission. those who knew that H1N1 could be transmitted 'via droplets', 'bodily contact with infected person' or 'touching contaminated objects' those who believed H1N1 would cause severe irreversible bodily damage were more likely to be worried that either they or their family members would contract H1N1. those who believed either the general public and/or the local government would be able to control a large scale local H1N1 outbreak were less likely to show the worry (multivariate OR = 0.51). risk perception Perceived severity of H1N1 High fatality Disagree/unsure 14.4 1.00 NS 5.1 1.00 1 Agree 20.9 1.57* 9.3 1.93* 1.94 (1.08 - 3.49)* Severe irreversible bodily damages Disagree/unsure 13.8 1.00 1 5.5 1.00 NS High or very high 37.2 3.70*** 3.31 (2.02 - 5.42)*** 11.6 2.26* Family members Low/very low inadequacy of government preparation (health system) was assessed by 3 items: local health system do not have enough medication for treating H1N1; local health system do not have enough vaccine for H1N1; Hong Kong government will be able to control a large-scale H1N1 outbreak. 61.8% held at least one of the unconfirmed beliefs that H1N1 could be transmitted through airborne spread across long distance. 97.5%, 74.2% and 77.8% correctly knew that H1N1 is transmittable via droplets, touching the body of infected person or contaminated objects. about 60.3% of the respondents correctly knew that H1N1 is transmitted via droplets, touching the body of infected person or contaminated objects. close to 10% of the respondents perceived a high or very high chance for himself/herself (8.6%), his/her family members (8.7%) or the general public (12.5%) to contract H1N1 in the next year. unconfirmed beliefs and correct knowledge about modes of transmission of H1N1 Of all respondents, 61.8% held at least one of the unconfirmed beliefs that H1N1 could be transmitted through airborne spread across long distance. 39% (38.9%) of the respondents believed there was so far no effective drug available to treat H1N1 (Table 2). Risk perceptions Around 20% of the respondents believed that H1N1 is highly fatal (20.6%) or could cause severe irreversible bodily damages (18.9%; Table 2). Respectively, 7.1% and 47.6% believed that Hong Kong has a higher or lower chance of having a large scale H1N1 outbreak in the future year.
