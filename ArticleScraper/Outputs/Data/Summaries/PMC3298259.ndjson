{"summary": "166 blood samples were obtained from 41 patients (68% female) 11\u201380 years of age. 7 of the 41 patients were tested for SARS-CoV by reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in a study previously described. 4 patients had positive results. 293T cells were transfected by using lipofectamine 2000 and selected with G418, and a bulk ACE2-positive, G418-resistant population was grown. each plate of 293T cells was transfected with 1 g gag/pol construct, 1.5 g of enhanced GFP reporter construct, and 1.5 g envelope-expressing construct. 166 blood samples were obtained from 41 patients, 11\u201380 years of age. none of these patients died of the infection. all cell lines were cultured in DMEM with Glutamax and high glucose. the gene encoding the receptor for human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was cloned from a human primary kidney cDNA library. the gene encoding the receptor for SARS-CoV was cloned from a human primary kidney cDNA library. Fifty PFU of SARS Frankfurt strain were added to serum dilution and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. we added 5 104 Vero E6 cells per well to the virus and serum mix. mixture was incubated in 96-well plates for 4 days, after which neutralization was assessed by cytopathic effect. retroviral particles pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S were made by cotransfection of an S-expressing plasmid, pCAGGS-S. culture supernatants were used to infect human TE671, 293T, and quail QT6/ACE2 cell lines. MLV(VSV) and HIV(VSV) pseudotypes infected all 3 cell lines tested. infection titers are given as infectious units per milliliter (IU/mL) Arrow indicates that infection titer was less than the detection limit, 102 IU/mL. blinded panel of 50 samples comprising sera from healthy persons, patients infected with other human coronaviruses. correlation of neutralizing antibody titers measured by plaque reduction assay with titers measured with pseudotype assay. LV, neutralizing antibody titer by using replication-competent severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (live virus); PV, neutralizing antibody titer by using pseudotype virus. severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) neutralizing antibody\u2013positive rate by time of blood sample collection. black bars represent the number of patients tested for neutralizing antibodies (Nab+) samples are considered positive for Nab if the 90% neutralizing antibody titer determined by using murine leukemia virus (SARS) pseudotypes is >10. the highest titer (3.5 105 IU/mL) was obtained with the combination of QT6/ACE2 cells and MLV(SARS), so this system was employed for all subsequent assays. titers were given as infectious units per milliliter (IU/mL) logarithmic plots of pseudotype versus live virus neutralization titers are shown in Figure 2. Correlation coefficients for pseudotype IC90 and IC50 titers versus live virus neutralization titers were 0.69 and 0.78 respectively. MLV(VSV) infection was not substantially inhibited by sera from healthy persons or from persons with human coronavirus OC43 and 229E antibodies. titers peaked during week 4 (mean titers 28\u2013640) but persisted in some patients for >200 days after onset of fever. black bars represent the number of patients tested for neutralizing antibodies (Nab+) new tab Neutralizing antibodies to severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013associated coronavirus spike protein in sequential blood samples from 4 representative patients. lines represent profiles of individual patients; Filled black symbols represent geometric mean titers at individual time points. IC90, 90% inhibitory concentration. rapid detection of neutralizing antibodies seen in this study suggests localized vaccination with an effective vaccine is likely to help control the spread of SARS-CoV during an outbreak. a broad spectrum of longitudinal profiles is seen in patients with SARS by using blood samples collected at serial time points (up to day 287) this test is expected to be equally applicable to animal sera."}
