{"summary": "the number of antibiotic-resistant pathogens is increasing, the level of resistance to standard antibiotics is increasing, and the percentage of isolates with resistance to multiple antibiotics has risen dramatically in recent years. most of the new antibiotics that have been approved for use in the united states in the past 40 years are not new classes of antibiotics but are simply chemical derivatives of the same antibiotic classes. repeated peptide motif with one cationic residue followed by either one or two hydrophobic residues may be an important feature for efficient membrane penetration. more recently, we have compared a variety of membrane-penetrating peptides for their abilities to enhance the efficacy of peptide phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers. mutants that are resistant to (RFF)3RXB-AcpP were selected by growth in Mueller-Hinton II or LB broth. transformants with pSE380myc-luc (11) were grown in LB medium supplemented with 50 g/ml ampicillin. PPMOs were synthesized at AVI BioPharma, Inc. (Corvallis, OR) the base sequence of all PPMOs targeted to acpP (AcpP) is 5\u2032-CTTCGATAGTG-3\u2032, that of all PPMOs targeted to luc (Luc) is 5\u2032-AACGTTGAGIG. all antibiotics except bleomycin were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. an overnight culture was diluted to 1 104 CFU/ml in LB medium and divided into 20 1-ml aliquots. each aliquot was grown overnight at 37\u00b0C with aeration. colonies were enumerated. PCRs were run on a 1605 air thermocycler (Idaho Technology, Idaho Falls, ID) the acpP allele from each strain analyzed was amplified by PCR (18) the PCR products were gel purified using a Qiagen MinElute PCR purification kit (Valencia, CA) and sequenced using the same primers shown above. mutants that are resistant to the PPMO (RFF)3RXB-AcpP were selected by growth in Mueller-Hinton II broth supplemented with 8 MIC of (RFF)3RXB-AcpP. agar was used for growth on solid medium. PPMOs were synthesized at AVI BioPharma, Inc. (Corvallis, OR) the base sequence of all PPMOs targeted to acpP (AcpP) is 5\u2032-CTTCGATAGTGTTC-3\u2032. that of all PPMOs targeted to luc (Luc) is 5\u2032-AACGTTGAGIG. cpP-resistant mutants were made chemically competent and transformed as described previously (29) with pSE380myc-Luc (11) overnight cultures were grown aerobically at 37\u00b0C in LBA and then diluted 2 102 into LBA with or without various concentrations (8, 20, and 50 M) of (RFF)3RXB-Luc or (RFF)3RXB-Scr and grown aerobically at 37\u00b0C for 7 h. insertion mutations from PPMO-resistant mutants were sequenced by rescue cloning as described previously. PCR mixtures contained chromosomal DNA extracted from bacteria using a commercial kit. PCRs were run on a 1605 air thermocycler (Idaho Technology, Idaho Falls, ID) RESULTS Spontaneous resistance was apparent from growth that occasionally occurred in some cultures that included (RFF)3RXB-AcpP at concentrations above the MIC. growth above the MIC was never observed in cultures that included other AcpP PPMOs with different peptides attached to the same PMO. MICs for different AcpP PPMOs were measured using strains PR200.1 and W3110 as indicators. all of the AcpP PPMOs tested had the same base sequence but had different peptides attached. the attached peptides differed not only in their amino acid compositions but also in the pattern of repeating sequences of cationic and nonpolar residues. the results show that PR200.1 was resistant to every AcpP PMO with the C-N-N peptide motif tested but fully susceptible to the (RX)6B-AcpP PMO and (RXR)4XB-AcpP. PR200.1 was resistant to (RFR)4XB-AcpP, which shares the C-N-C motif with (RXR)4XB-AcpP but contains phenylalanine instead of 6-aminohexaonoic acid. resistance to (RFF)3RXB-AcpP in PR200.1 increased the MIC 16-fold. the scrambled-base-sequence control had no effect on the growth of either W3110 or PR200.1. a plasmid that expresses luciferase had been transferred into PR200.1. the scrambled-base-sequence control did not inhibit luciferase in either strain. there were no differences in growth (optical density) of any of the cultures. cultures were treated for 7 h without PPMO (no PPMO) or with 3 concentrations of a PPMO. MIC of (RFF)3R-AcpP (NG-05-0200) using oligopeptide transport mutants E. coli strain Mutation/phenotype MIC M g/ml Morse 2034 Wild-type oligopeptide transport 5 28 PA0183 opp knockout, oligopeptide permease deletion 5 28 PA0333 dpp and opp knockout, PA0183 plus dipeptide permease deletion 5 28 PA06 the MIC of (RFF)3RXB-AcpP was the same (2 M, or 11 g/ml) using either the dctA or eptA knockout strain or the parent strain. the MIC of (RXR)4XB-AcpP was measured using the sbmA-knockout strain as an indicator. RR3 was about 4-fold resistant to each of the peptide antibiotics bleomycin and phleomycin. PR200.1 was also 4-fold resistant to bleomycin and phleomycin. RR3 was 32-fold more resistant to (RFF)3RXB-AcpP and 8-fold more resistant to (RXR)4XB-AcpP. pSbma fully restored the susceptibility of RR3 to the PPMO. the rate of spontaneous resistance to (RFF)3RXB-AcpP was measured and found to be 4 107 mutations/cell generation. the target of the PMO, acpP, was sequenced in PR200.1 and W3110. MICs for different AcpP PPMOs were measured using strains PR200.1 and W3110 as indicators. all of the AcpP PPMOs tested had the same base sequence but had different peptides attached. the attached peptides differed not only in their amino acid compositions but also in the pattern of repeating sequences of cationic and nonpolar residues. coli Motif, PPMO no.a Conjugated peptideb MIC (M [g/ml]) W3110 PR200.1 Motif 1 (C-N-N) NG-05-0200 RFFRFFRFFRXB 2.5 (14) 40 (222) NG-05-0653 DRDFDFDRDFDFDRXB 2.5 (14) 40 (222) NG-23-248 RXXRXXRXXRXB 20 (102) resistance to (RFF)3RXB-AcpP in PR200.1 increased the MIC 16-fold. PR200.1 was also resistant to the d-isomeric form of (RFF)3RXB. the scrambled-base-sequence control had no effect on the growth of either W3110 or PR200.1. stationary cultures of W3110 or PR200.1 were diluted to 5 105 CFU/ml in Mueller-Hinton broth and divided in three. the scrambled-base-sequence control (RFF)3RXB-Scr showed no detectable MIC (>160 M) the scrambled-base-sequence control (RFF)3RXB-Scr showed no detectable MIC. MIC of (RFF)3R-AcpP (NG-05-0200) using oligopeptide transport mutants E. coli strain Mutation/phenotype MIC M g/ml Morse 2034 Wild-type oligopeptide transport 5 28 PA0183 opp knockout, oligopeptide permease deletion 5 28 PA0333 dpp and opp knockout, PA0183 plus dipeptide permease deletion 5 28 PA06 the MIC obtained using the sbmA knockout strain was 32 M (179 g/ml) the MIC of (RXR)4XB-AcpP was measured using the sbmA knockout strain as an indicator and found to be 2 M (11 g/ml), the same as that for its isogenic parent strain. RR3 was about 4-fold resistant to each of the peptide antibiotics bleomycin and phleomycin. PR200.1 was also 4-fold resistant to bleomycin and phleomycin. RR3 was 32-fold more resistant to (RFF)3RXB-AcpP and 8-fold more resistant to (RXR)4XB-AcpP. pSbma fully restored the susceptibility of RR3 to the PPMO. the rate of spontaneous resistance to (RFF)3RXB-AcpP was similar to the rate of spontaneous mutation for individual genes in E. coli. this suggests that there are few genes which, when mutated, can give rise to the PPMO-resistant phenotype. resistance to the PPMO is not caused by a change in physiology that might result in resistance to antibiotics in general. the mutation in PR200.1 is specific for (RFF)3RXB-AcpP or PPMOs with similar peptide moieties. oligopeptide transport mutants were just as susceptible to (RFF)3RXB-AcpP. resistance in PR200.1 was not caused by a mutation in the known oligopeptide transporters that were tested. transposome mutant RR3 was resistant to both (RFF)3RXB-AcpP and (RXR)4XB-AcpP. this differs from the result for the spontaneous mutant PR200.1 and the strain with the sbmA deletion. this suggests that in RR3 a polar effect on the gene downstream from sbmA (yaiW) may be responsible for resistance to (RXR)4XB-AcpP sbmA mutants seem to be more resistant to PPMOs with more F. sbmA homologs are widely conserved among bacteria. substrate specificity of SbmA is flexible enough to accommodate polypeptides without thiazole, oxazole, or proline. if SbmA is transporter of (RFF)3RXB-AcpP, specificity of SbmA is not limited to thiazole, oxazole, or proline. PPMOs may be able to cross the plasma membrane by passing through the lipid bilayer in the same manner that they cross the outer membrane. the latter possibility is suggested by the ability of PMOs to inhibit gene expression in strains with porous outer membranes that allow passage of large oligomers."}
