{"summary": "the spike protein (S) of SARS Coronavirus mediates entry of the virus into target cells, including receptor binding and membrane fusion. this was investigated using the previously described SARS pseudotyped particles system (SARSpp) and fluorescence-based cell-cell fusion assays. transmembrane domains (TMDs) or amino acid residues adjacent to the TMDs of viral fusion proteins, play a role in this process. it is very likely that the transmembrane domains (TMDs) or amino acid residues adjacent to the TMDs of viral fusion proteins, play a role in this process. spike protein consists of three domains: 1) a highly conserved N-terminal aromatic (tryptophan) rich stretch, 2) a hydrophobic core sequence and 3) a C-terminal cysteine rich domain. these domains are highly conserved in all coronaviruses. aromatic and cysteine domains are conserved between coVs. mutagenesis of the aromatic domain of SARS S Previously, the aromatic domain of HIV gp41 has been shown to be important for the entry of HIV into target cells [8] by creating mutant SARO. the membrane interfaciality of amino acids has been ranked 16. tryptophan scores highest on this WW-index. second in this ranking is phenylalanine. aromatic domain mutants were incorporated efficiently into SARSpp. they were able to trimerize and trimerize. tryptophan residues have been implicated in the process of fusion pore dilation. tia induced by SARO/C27 and SW123A/C27 contained only a few cells. cells seemed to form small groups, but with a different morphology than the positive controls, indicating that the cell-fusion mediating activity was altered. results were confirmed by mixing L-ACE2 cells with 293T cells transiently expressing S or S mutants. double staining of a cell indicated full cell cell fusion. pore formation does not result in dye exchange. previously, cells expressing aromatic-mutants of HIV-1 GP41 molecules have been shown to be unable to induce syncytium formation. the supposed TMD domain of SARS S is quite long. the N-terminal lysine (pos. 1193) is located in the aromatic domain, whereas the C-terminal lysine is located between cys box 1 and cys box 2 (pos. 1227) the number of amino acids between these two lysines is 33, whereas a typical TMD consists of approximately 16-20 amino acids. glycine 1201 was replaced for a lysine residue (SG1201K). alanine was inserted at the same position (Sins1202K) to check whether this phenotype was the result of the charge of the lysine. alanine was inserted at the same position (Sins1202A) we propose that the membrane spanning domain of SARS S starts at F1202 and ends at S1224. aromatic domain of HIV gp41 has been shown to be important for the entry of HIV into target cells [8], in particular for the dilation of fusion pores [7]. the membrane interfaciality of amino acids has been ranked 16. tryptophan scores highest on this WW-index. second in this ranking is phenylalanine. aromatic domain mutants were incorporated efficiently into SARSpp. aromatic-domain is involved in pore dilation Tryptophans play an important role. in particular, tryptophan residues have been implicated in fusion pore dilation. syncytia induced by SARO/C27 and SW123A/C27 contained only a few cells and had an irregular shape compared to SWT or SC27 induced syncytia. cells seemed to form small groups, but with a different morphology than the positive controls, indicating that the cell-fusion mediating activity was altered. double staining of a cell indicated full cell cell cell fusion. double staining of a cell indicated full cell cell cell fusion. cells expressing aromatic-mutants of HIV-1 GP41 molecules shown to induce fusion pore formation. the supposed TMD domain of SARS S is quite long. the N-terminal lysine (pos. 1193) is located in the aromatic domain. the C-terminal lysine is located between cys box 1 and cys box 2. the number of amino acids between these two lysines is 33. introducing a lysine directly downstream of the aromatic domain yielded two fundamentally different outcomes. glycine 1201 was replaced for a lysine residue (SG1201K) mediated entry was 60% compared to entry mediated by SWT. alanine was inserted at the same position (Sins1202A) to check whether this phenotype was the result of the charge of the lysine. the membrane spanning domain of SARS S starts at F1202 and ends at S1224. lysine scanning mutagenesis showed that at position 1201 a charged residue could be tolerated, indicating that the aromatic domain is located outside the membrane. a lysine is present between the aromatic domain and the transmembrane domain. the more tryptophans are lacking in the aromatic domain, the less active the spikes are in their entry-mediating capacity. the more tryptophans are lacking in the aromatic domain, the less active the spikes are in their entry-mediating capacity. a single mutant would exhibit residual activity, as compared to double or triple mutants. fusion peptide and the TMD function as a hydrophobic sheet to allow lipid flow between the two fusing membranes. tryptophan residues have been shown to interact with cholesterol in the membrane, thereby modulating membrane curvature, possibly supporting lipidic intermediates during membrane fusion. both the HIV GP41 and SARS CoV S also contain a so-called CRAC motif. insertion of one amino acid resulted in a block of entry (Sins1202K and Sins1202A) this suggests that the positioning of the aromatic domain relative to the hydrophobic domain is crucial for membrane fusion activity. we propose a mechanism in which the lateral flexibility of the aromatic domain, the TMD domain and the cys box 1 domain are pivotal for entry (membrane fusion activity) of SARSpp and most likely also SARS CoV. aromatic domain oligomerizes and consequently the S proteins cluster. oligomerization also results in a clustering of cholesterol in the membrane. glycines present in the hydrophobic central domain of SARS CoV S also play an important role during entry [34]. mutants that do not have tryptophans in the aromatic domain are unable to support entry of SARSpp, yet are capable of initializing membrane fusion. the aromatic domain of HIV GP41 has been suggested to be involved in dilation of the fusion pore. cys box 1 does not need to enter a hydrophobic environment. tryptophanes are involved in sequestering of multiple GP41 molecules to establish a proteinaceous ring thereby promoting the formation of a fusion pore. peptides representing the aromatic domain (of SARS CoV or HIV) are membrane active and are capable of altering the biophysical properties of membranes [21,23-25] phenotypic features of mutants lacking tryptophan residues. insertion of one amino acid resulted in a complete block of fusion. this suggests that positioning of the aromatic domain relative to the hydrophobic domain is crucial for membrane fusion activity. aromatic domain oligomerizes and consequently the S proteins cluster. aromatic domain oligomerization also results in a clustering of cholesterol in the membrane, thereby inducing bending of the membrane with a negative curvature. the presence of the aromatic domain and the cysteine rich domain ensures a lateral flexibility of the S protein within the membrane, that is necessary for induction of membrane fusion. the presence of the aromatic domain and the cysteine rich domain ensures a lateral flexibility of the S protein within the membrane. the percentage of GFP positive cells was determined by FACS analysis on a FACS Calibur (Becton-Dickinson) the basis for all assays was the same, only the read-out was different. for the immunofluorescence and dye transfer assay, 293T cells were transfected using lipofectamine 2000. calcein (Molecular probes, Invitrogen) was added to the ACE-2 expressing cells to a final concentration of 2 M and CMAC (Molecular probes, Invitrogen) was added to the ACE-2 expressing cells to a final concentration of 2 M. cells were incubated for 45 minutes at 37\u00b0C, while being resuspended every 15 minutes. transfection of 293T cells with a set of retroviral Gag Pol expression constructs, a GFP reporter plasmid and the SARS CoV spike mutant was carried out using a caCl2 transfection kit (Clontech) two days after transfection supernatants were harvested and used to transduce VeroE6R cells. cells were incubated with goat anti ACE-2 antibody (R&D systems) then incubated with rabbit-anti spike antibody (a kind gift from Dr. Eickmann) and Cy5 conjugated Rabbit-anti goat antibody. cells were washed, mounted, and studied using a fluorescence microscope (Zeiss) the ratio of cells was 1 to 3 (S cells to ACE-2 cells, respectively) after 24 hours incubation, cells were fixed with 3.5% paraformaldehyde and analyzed by fluorescence microscopy. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
