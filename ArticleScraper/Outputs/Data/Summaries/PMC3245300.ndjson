{"summary": "the first global pandemic of the 21st century was announced by the world health organization (WHO) in 2009. more than 214 countries have reported laboratory confirmed cases. more than 18,449 deaths have been recorded. a major challenge in influenza vaccine development is the rapid evolution of influenza viruses, causing vaccines to be easily outdated and reformulation necessary each year [31]\u2013[33]. oseltamivir-resistant viruses with neuraminidase mutation (such as H275Y) have been reported [34], [35]. computational docking is important for investigating ligand-protein interactions. 81 native TCM compounds docked into both H1 and N1 and were used for de novo evolution. de novo compounds with dual binding capacities to H1 and N1 were ranked by combined DockScore. Xylopine_2, Rosmaricine_14 and Rosmaricine_15 have in common a pyridinium addition to their native structure. the pyridinium addition could be the main explanation for higher DockScores of these three derivatives compared to their native compounds. Xylopine_2 interacts with Asp151 via a protonated amino group. Tamiflu forms H-bond interactions with Arg156, Arg293 and Arg368, but not with Asp151 or Glu228. the correlation between observed and predicted activities of the 27 ligands is shown in Figure 4A. all values were within the 95% prediction bands and the r2 value = 0.8043. the SVM model was constructed using identical molecular descriptors and ligands. ligand RMSDs of four complexes ranged between 1.4\u20131.7. Xylopine_2 stabilized after 15 ns, and total energy of the complex equilibrated at 19,000 kcal/mol. ligand RMSD was observed in Tamiflu\u00ae for the first 5 ns. cis conformations are less stable than trans- counterparts. Xylopine_2 can easily form H-bond at Glu119 and Glu228, with high occupancy rates of 98.63% and 96.05%. Rosmaricine_15 forms H-bonds with Arg368 (82.50%) and Arg156 (57.33%) despite the low occupancy rates, the bond distance profiles suggest that Tyr402 is an important N1 binding site for Rosmaricine_15 and Tamiflu\u00ae. despite the low occupancy rates, the bond distance profiles suggest that Tyr402 is an important N1 binding site.

H-bond distance profile between N1 and TCM candidates can be discerned from MD simulation. the increase in bond distance from Arg293 starting at 3 ns was due to Arg293 intermolecular H-bond formation between the O atom and NH2 residue. however, all H-bonds were maintained throughout the MD simulation. the mechanism for stability of Rosmaricine_14 is similar to that of Rosmaricine_14. the torsion angles of flexible bonds in each candidate are summarized in Figure 8. the fluctuations could be attributed to the attraction between the amine group H atoms and Asp 103. b was the primary location for torque changes in Xylopine_2. amino acids involved in hydrophobic interactions included pro82, Asp103, Asn104, Cys107, Cys153, and Pro154. more stabilizing interactions including H-bonds and hydrophobic interactions were observed in the N1 binding site. CoMFA and CoMSIA models were built and validated using 27 neuraminidase inhibitors listed in Table S2. the model was generated using both steric and electrostatic fields and yielded a non-cross validated r2 value of 0.924. the optimal CoMSIA model consisted of steric and hydrophobic fields, H-bond acceptors and donors. +E+H+D+A 5 0.561 0.946 0.331 62.823 ONC: Standard error of estimate.

Observed and predicted activities of 27 neuraminidase inhibitors by CoMFA and CoMSIA models. the validated CoMFA and CoMSIA maps were used to assess ligand bioactivity. Contour of the de novo compounds at 20 ns MD simulation to the relative spatial positions of CoMFA and CoMSIA feature maps are shown in Figure 11. CoMFA models of Xylopine_2 (A, B), Rosmaricine_14 (C, D), Rosmaricine_15 (E, F) and Tamiflu (G, H) are given. Contours in CoMFA represent the following features: favors bulky substituent (green), disfavors bulky substituent (yellow), favors electropositive groups (blue), and disfavors electropositive groups (red) the TCM de novo derivatives docked into the H1 binding site and formed critical interactions at Glu83 and Asp103 without losing contour to the CoMFA and CoMSIA maps. these results suggest that biological activity was also predicted in both binding sites, thus it is possible to develop dual-targeting drugs from the selected derivatives. Xylopine_2, Rosmaricine_14, and Rosmaricine_15 are the top three de novo derivatives exhibiting binding affinity to H1 and N1. key binding locations of the de novo derivatives include Glu83 and Asp103 for H1, and Glu228 and Arg292 for N1. Mutations currently attributed to oseltamivir resistance are located at H275 and N295S of the NA [103] the de novo derivatives do not bind to amino acids in H1 or N1 that are prone to mutation. multiple bond formations observed in MD provide additional insurance against possible mutations at key binding residues.

Docking of the de novo derivatives back to the receptor provides insights to modifications that can be made to modulate or enhance molecular properties. Xylopine_2 interacts with Asp151 via a protonated amino group and has pi and hydrogen bond (H-bond) interactions with Trp179 and Glu228, respectively. the MLR model established for the neuramindase inhibitors is: Correlation between observed and predicted activities (pIC50) of 27 neuraminidase inhibitors using different prediction models. the predicted activity of Tamiflu\u00ae using the generated MLR model is similar to observed bioactivity values reported in the literature. ligand RMSDs of four complexes ranged between 1.4\u20131.7. Xylopine_2 stabilized after 15 ns, and total energy of the complex equilibrated at 19,000 kcal/mol. no changes were observed in ligand RMSD for the first 5 ns.

Xylopine_2 can easily form H-bond at Glu119 and Glu228. the bond distance profiles suggest that Tyr402 is an important N1 binding site for Rosmaricine_15 and Tamiflu\u00ae. despite the low occupancy rates, the bond distance profiles suggest that Tyr402 is an important N1 binding site for Rosmaricine_15 and Tamiflu\u00ae. glu228:OE2 34.00% H-bond_4 H64 Thr226:O 45.95% H-bond_5 H55 Thr226:O 26.50% H-bond_6 H27 Tyr402:OH 7.13% Tamiflu\u00ae H-bond 1 O3 Arg368:HH22 82.50% H-bond 2 O10 Arg118:HE 8.90% H-bond-3 O10 Arg156:HH12 57.33% H-bond_4 H the multiple attachment points anchor both the aminopyridine moiety and the rosmaricine moiety. the increase in bond distance from Arg293 starting at 3 ns was due to Arg293 intermolecular H-bond formation between the O atom and NH2 residue. the mechanism for stability of Rosmaricine_14 is similar to that of Rosmaricine_14. the ability of the de novo derivatives to form stable H1-ligand complexes has also been assessed. the fluctuations could be attributed to the attraction between the amine group H atoms and Asp 103, the key binding sites on H1. H1-ligand interactions following MD are illustrated for (A) Xylopine_2, (B) Rosmaricine_14, (C) Rosmaricine_15, and (D) Tamiflu\u00ae. hydrophobic interactions also played a role in stabilizing ligands within H1 and N1 binding sites during MD. ligand RMSDs of four complexes ranged between 1.4\u20131.7.

Rosmarcine_15 and Tamiflu\u00ae did not form high occupancy H-bonds with Tyr402. despite the low occupancy rates, the bond distance profiles suggest that Tyr402 is an important N1 binding site for Rosmaricine_15 and Tamiflu\u00ae. bond 2 H48 Asn344:OD1 78.10% H-bond-3 H53 Glu228:OE2 34.00% H-bond_4 H64 Thr226:O 45.95% H-bond_5 H55 Thr226:O 26.50% H-bond_6 H27 Tyr402:OH 7.13% Tamiflu\u00ae H-bond 1 O3 Arg368:HH22 82.50% H-bond 2 O10 Arg118:HE 8.90% H Rosmaricine_14 bound to Glu119, Glu228, and Arg293 through 6, 7, and 8 respectively. the multiple attachment points anchor both the aminopyridine moiety and the rosmaricine moiety, reducing strain on the molecular structure. the mechanism for stability of Rosmaricine_14 is similar to that of Rosmaricine_14. the stability of Tamiflu as a result of these binding anchors is reflected in the low total energy profile (Figure 5) and small H-bond distance fluctuations (Figure 7D) the ability of the de novo derivatives to form stable H1-ligand complexes has also been assessed [92]. H1-ligand interactions following MD are illustrated for (A) Xylopine_2, (B) Rosmaricine_14, (C) Rosmaricine_15 and (D) Tamiflu\u00ae. amino acids involved in hydrophobic interactions also played a role in stabilizing ligands within H1 and N1 binding sites during MD. coMFA and CoMSIA models were built and validated using 27 neuraminidase inhibitors listed in Table S2. the optimal CoMSIA model (r2 = 0.937, q2 = 0.673, ONC = 5) consisted of steric and hydrophobic fields, H-bond acceptors and donors. 925 0.401 34.912 S+H 6 0.565 0.977 0.223 119.225 S+H+D 5 0.570 0.906 0.435 34.000 H+D+A 6 0.528 0.957 0.304 62.855 S+H+D+A* 5 0.673 0.937 0.357 53.360 S+E+H+D+A 5 0.561 0.946 0.331 62.823 ONC: Optimal number of components.

Contours in CoMFA represent the following features: favors bulky substituent (green), disfavors bulky substituent (yellow), favors electropositive groups (blue), disfavors electropositive groups (red) indirect support was provided by assessing the ability of de novo derivatives to maintain contour to the N1 CoMFA/CoMSIA maps. the TCM de novo derivatives docked into the H1 binding site and formed critical interactions at Glu83 and Asp103 without losing contour to the CoMFA and CoMSIA maps. this results suggest that biological activity was also predicted in both binding sites. potential inhibitors for N1 should have salt bridge and/or H-bond formation at Glu228 and interactions with Asp293. these features can be used to identify or design novel drugs for H1 and/or N1. each compound could structurally fulfill the requirements of both H1 and N1 binding sites, thus supporting their potential as dual-targeting compounds. mutations currently attributed to oseltamivir resistance are located at H275 and N295S of the NA. derivatives do not bind to amino acids in H1 or N1 that are prone to mutation. a single point mutation will remain bound to the H1 and N1 sites through another key residue. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - de novo derivative generation, and molecular dynamics simulation were performed using Discovery Studio Client v2.5.0.9164. the two-dimensional and three-dimensional structures of TCM compounds were generated using ChemBioOffice 2008 (PerkinElmer Inc., Cambridge, MA) de novo products that docked into both H1 and N1 proteins were selected and ranked by the sum of their respective H1 and N1 DockScore. top ten compounds with the highest DockScore were selected for further structure-based analysis. ns using NVT canonical ensemble and trajectory frames were saved every 20 ps. time step was set to 2 fs for all MD stages. temperature coupling decay time was set to 0.4 ps. de novo products that docked into both H1 and N1 proteins were selected. top ten compounds with highest DockScore were selected for further structure-based analysis. Molecular descriptors of compounds were calculated using Calculate Molecular Properties in DS 2.5. the GFA was used to select the best representative molecular descriptors. the complexes were created with a 10 solvation shell of TIP3 water around the protein. Sodium cations were added to each system for neutralization. the optimal number of components was obtained from leave-one-out method to yield the highest r2 and q2 values in non-cross validation and cross-validation respectively."}
