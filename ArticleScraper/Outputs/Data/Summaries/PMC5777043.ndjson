{"summary": "CV-A24v can bind Sia, but Sia was not found to initiate uncoating. soluble receptor domains (VLDL-R) or antibodies targeting various known enterovirus receptors (ICAM-1, DAF, integrin 2, PVR, CAR, integrin v3 and PSGL-1) blocked CV-A24v infection. biolayer interferometry and CV-A24v neutralization pointed to a direct interaction between CV-A24v and ICAM-1. several CV-A24v clinical isolates, the nonvariant prototype strain Joseph, and a nonvariant clinical isolate all require ICAM-1 for infection. ICAM-1KO transfected with plasmid encoding ICAM-1 cDNA exposed to virus. yields of infectious virus were measured after a single replication cycle. the global resolution of the EM density is 3.9 (Fig. S2 A\u2013D), the resolution of the viral capsid proteins is 3.6\u20133.8, and that of the capsid-interfacing region of ICAM-1 D1 is 3.7 (Fig. S2 E\u2013H) the surface of an enterovirus particle is composed of 60 copies of the structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3 (Fig. 2A) a hydrogen bonding network tethers the DE loop of ICAM-1 D1 (Arg49, Asn47 and Pro45) to VP1 (Tyr230) and VP2 (Ala138, Lys139 and Thr140) many of these residues are conserved among other ICAM-1\u2013binding viruses belonging to the enterovirus C species, suggesting a conserved mode of interaction with ICAM-1 (18). surface representation of the EM-derived atomic model for the quasi-threefold axis of CV-A24v (gray) and ICAM-1 D1 (pink), with residues forming salt bridges labeled and colored according to charge. the surface of ICAM-1 D1 that interacts with CV-A24v is gray. sia removal from HCE cells incompletely inhibited CV-A24v infection. knockout of ICAM-1 completely blocked CV-A24v infection. sia plays a role in cell attachment of CV-A24v. viral RNA levels were determined by qPCR either directly (E) or after a single replication cycle (D). levels of radioactively labeled CV-A24v 110390 bound to NA-treated primary conjunctival cells with expanded lifespan (HC0597) on ice (0 \u00b0C) or at 37 \u00b0C. lectins such as coronavirus hemagglutinin-esterases (20) and influenza NAs (19) acquired capsid residue that enhances Sia binding. dsRNA antibody (green) and nuclei with DAPI (blue) staining of infected cells with dsRNA antibody (green) RNA (green) and nuclei (blue) denote mean SEM of four technical and two biological replicates. images shown in A and F are representative confocal micrographs. Error bars represent mean SEM of three biological replicates. a genetic change could result from a population bottleneck that variant strains may have undergone when invading a new target tissue. however, the absence of this residue in the \u201cancestral\u201d strain EH24/70 suggests that Tyr250 was not present during the initial tropism switch but was adopted by its pandemic descendants. v can bind Sia, but sia was not found to initiate uncoating. soluble receptor domains (VLDL-R) or antibodies targeting various known enterovirus receptors (ICAM-1, DAF, integrin 2, PVR, CAR, integrin v3 and PSGL-1) were used. only the antibody against ICAM-1 blocked CV-A24v infection (Fig. 1A) several CV-A24v clinical isolates, the nonvariant prototype strain Joseph, and a nonvariant clinical isolate all require ICAM-1 for infection. soluble ICAM-1 ectodomain in primary conjunctival cells showed a direct interaction between CV-A24v and ICAM-1. ICAM-1KO transfected with plasmid encoding ICAM-1 cDNA exposed to virus. yields of infectious virus were determined after a single replication cycle. biolayer interferometry of virus binding to either ICAM-1 or negative control receptor LAMP-1. the global resolution of the EM density is 3.9 (Fig. S2 A\u2013D), the resolution of the viral capsid proteins is 3.6\u20133.8. the surface of an enterovirus particle is composed of 60 copies of the structural proteins VP1, VP2 and VP3. a depression encircling each fivefold axis of symmetry forms the so-called canyon. a hydrogen bonding network tethers the DE loop of ICAM-1 D1 (Arg49, Asn47 and Pro45) to VP1 (Tyr230) and VP2 (Ala138, Lys139 and Thr140) many of these residues are conserved among other ICAM-1\u2013binding viruses belonging to the enterovirus C species. only VP1 Asp238 and VP3 Asp181 are present in ICAM-1\u2013binding rhinoviruses the surface of CV-A24v (gray) and ICAM-1 D1 (pink) are labeled and colored in respect to their interacting partners. residues forming salt bridges are colored according to charge (red is negative, blue is positive). sia removal from HCE cells incompletely inhibited CV-A24v infection. knockout of ICAM-1 completely blocked CV-A24v infection. sia plays a role in cell attachment of CV-A24v. PCR either directly (E or after a single replication cycle (D) levels of radioactively labeled CV-A24v 110390 bound to NA-treated (V. cholerae 10 mU/mL) primary conjunctival cells with expanded lifespan (HC0597) on ice (0 \u00b0C) or at 37 \u00b0C. Error bars represent the mean SEM of three (A, B, D, and E) or eight (F) biological replicates pandemic CV-A24v strains have acquired capsid residue that enhances Sia binding. rases (20) and influenza NAs (19) acquired capsid residue that enhances sia binding. rases (20) and rases (20) denote mean SEM of three replicates. a phylogenetic tree of all available complete CV-A24 VP1 sequences. 189 of the 226 strains belong to the variant clade. a comparison of amino acid frequencies in the sia. binding site revealed that most nonvariant strains, as well as the first AHC strain EH24/70, have a phenylalanine at VP1 position 250. however, the absence of this residue in the \u201cancestral\u201d strain EH24/70 suggests that Tyr250 was not present during the initial tropism switch but was adopted by its pandemic descendants. emergence of pandemic CV-A24v may have been promoted by the acquisition of VP1 Tyr250. however, it remains unknown what has caused the initial adaptation of CV-A24 to the eye. the identification of ICAM-1\u2013binding residues in CV-A24v may help future studies investigating whether changes in ICAM-1 binding have contributed to the earliest manifestation of AHC. a sample was left to adsorb for 30 s before most of the sample was blotted away manually. 2,643 exposures were recorded using a FEI Falcon III direct electron detector. each exposure movie had a total exposure of 1 s and contained 40 frames. each exposure movie had a total exposure of 1 s and contained 40 frames. cDNA was generated using the NucleoSpin RNA Isolation Kit (740955.250; Macherey-Nagel) cDNA was generated using the TaqMan Reverse Transcription Reagents kit (740955.250; Macherey-Nagel) all available CV-A24(v) sequences spanning the entire VP1 protein were downloaded from GenBank (January 1, 2017) and aligned using the ClustalW (1.6) algorithm implemented in MEGA version 7. a phylogenetic tree of VP1 sequences was constructed using the neighbor-joining method. a total of 2,643 exposures were recorded using a FEI Falcon III direct electron detector operating in linear mode. each exposure movie had a total exposure of 1 s and contained 40 frames. images, model building, and refinement are described in SI Materials and Methods.
