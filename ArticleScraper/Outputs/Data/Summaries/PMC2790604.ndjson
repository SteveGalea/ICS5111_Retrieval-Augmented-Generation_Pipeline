{"summary": "dengue recombinant subviral particles produced in cells with either modified or chimeric proteins but not using native forms of prM and E. a stable HeLa cell line expressing DV1 prME was established (HeLa-prME) dengue virus is one of the most important vector-borne viral diseases in humans. but the interaction between dengue virus and host cells is only partly understood. there is an urgent need to develop new tools to gain insight into the viral journey through host cells. prM and E proteins from flaviviruses, such as yellow fever virus [11], japanese encephalitis virus [13], west Nile virus [14] and tick-bone encephalitis virus [15], [16] can cleavage into subviral particles in the absence of any other viral component. subviral particles could be a valuable tool for research on cell biology of DVs. optimization was first applied to the DV1 prME gene. we found that this experimental approach could efficiently increase the intracellular expression level of the E glycoprotein in human cells. we have established a DV1 RSPs producing stable cell line (HeLa-prME) d1d [24] strain contained the signal sequence of vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) envelope glycoprotein inserted in frame upstream of the prME cDNA. expression of dengue E protein was monitored by flow cytometry on permeabilized transfected cells with the 4E11 anti-E monoclonal antibody against dengue E protein. FITC-conjugated secondary antibody and analyzed by flow cytometry. a HeLa cell line that stably expresses DV1 prM and E envelope proteins was then established by transducing HeLa cells with a retroviral vector pCHMWS-prMEopt-IRES-Hygromycin. culture of HeLa-prME cells in the absence of hygromycin resulted in a significant reduction of prME expression. the DV1 E glycoprotein is efficiently expressed and enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum in the HeLa-prME stable cell line. DAPI staining was used to label cell nuclei (blue) to confirm that these structures contain viral proteins, we labeled thawed cryosections with the 4G2 antibody that recognizes the E protein. we found antibody binding for the E protein present in the lumen of cisternae, where it is localized to electron lucent, round particles and tubular structures. in addition, E protein is also found on amorphous, electron dense material present in these cisternae. label for the E protein is also found in the Golgi stack (G) and on vesicles in the Golgi area. expression of prM and E DV1 envelope proteins induces the formation of RSPs in an ER-derived compartment. a 50 kDa monomeric form of the E glycoprotein was predominantly observed in CL samples. a significant proportion of E protein is present as a homodimer in non-treated RSPs compared to the DTSSP treated. detection of E monomers most likely results from partial dissociation under the denaturing conditions of electrophoresis. secretion of DV RSPs was altered by incubation of cells at 15\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C. brefeldin A treatment inhibits exit from ER and induces fusion of Golgi membranes with ER. homodimerization of E, acquisition of complex sugars and efficient cleavage of prM indicate that prM and E viral proteins have correctly assembled in the ER into RSPs which have trafficked through the secretory pathway. SN and CL samples were treated with PNGase F (panel F) or EndoH (panel G) and subjected to Western blot analysis using 4E11 antibody. secretion of DV1 RSPs Assembled from newly synthesized proteins Requires 8 hours. prM was detected at the 24 hours time point, indicating that most secreted RSPs are mature. newly synthesized proteins need 8 hours to be translocated through secretory pathway and released into the supernatant as mature RSPs. we have obtained preliminary evidence that DV1 RSPs and DV1 viral particles isolated from HeLa-prME and mammalian infected cells, respectively, sediment at similar densities on 10\u201360% continuous gradient of sucrose. the supernatant from HeLa-prME cells was concentrated and resuspended in PBS or 0.5% Triton-X 100 containing PBS. the DV1 RSPs produced by HeLa-prME cell line CLDB was first used to estimate the RSPs yield from heLa-prME cell line. we found that the concentration of E protein in supernatant was around 500\u20131000 ng/ml under the culture condition used for siRNA transfection. non-targeting siRNA (NT) and siRNA targeting DV1 prME were added as controls. the three dynamins show a 2 to 4 fold increase in dengue RSPs secretion. these proteins are involved in the budding process or in the transport of vesicles. such an enhancement might have been due to a blockade in the re-internalization of secreted RSPs by HeLa-prME cells. anti-E 4E11 monoclonal antibody or a mixture of sera from four patients infected by all dengue serotypes. monomeric and dimeric forms of the DV1 E protein could be readily detected. weaker signals were observed for the other three serotypes. RSPs of DV1, DV2, DV3 and DV4 were concentrated in fractions containing 20% to 30% sucrose. the strategy of codon optimization was successful in leading to the production of RSPs of all serotypes of DV. prME gene optimization significantly improves viral protein expression in mammalian cells. we first transfected HeLa cells with native DV1 prME gene. it contained the signal sequence of vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) envelope glycoprotein inserted in frame upstream of prME cDNA. transfected cells were permeabilized, stained with the 4E11 anti-E monoclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated secondary antibody. a HeLa cell line that expresses DV1 prM and E envelope proteins was then established by transducing HeLa cells with a retroviral vector pCHMWS-prMEopt-IRES-Hygromycin. culture of HeLa-prME cells in the absence of hygromycin resulted the DV1 E glycoprotein is efficiently expressed and enriched in the endoplasmic reticulum in the HeLa-prME stable cell line. DAPI staining was used to label cell nuclei (blue) the scale bar represents 10 m. aligned particles are similar to the stacked viral particles described in cisternae of the rough ER in infected insect and mammalian cells. we labeled thawed cryosections with the 4G2 antibody that recognizes the E protein. antibody binding for the E protein is localized to electron lucent, round particles and tubular structures. label for the E protein is also found within the Golgi stack (G) and on vesicles in the Golgi area. expression of prM and E DV1 envelope proteins induces the formation of RSPs in an ER-derived compartment. the SN were incubated in the presence or absence of a cross linker. the SN were then subjected to Western blotting using the anti-E 4E11 antibody. these data indicate that, in SN, a significant proportion of E protein is present as a homodimer. detection of E monomers most likely results from partial dissociation. brefeldin A treatment inhibits exit from ER and induces fusion of Golgi membranes with ER. secretion of DV RSPs was altered by incubation of cells at 15\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C. brefeldin A treatment inhibits exit from ER and induces fusion of Golgi membranes with ER. the prM protein, prM protein and M protein could be observed with silver staining in supernatant from SN but not in parental HeLa cells. SN and CL samples were treated with PNGase F (panel F) or EndoH (panel G) and subjected to Western blot analysis using 4E11 antibody. a band corresponding to the molecular weight of M but not prM was detected at the 24 hours time point. newly synthesized proteins need 8 hours to be translocated through the secretory pathway and released into the supernatant as mature RSPs. in triton-X100 treated samples, E protein was solubilized and detected in fractions at the top of the gradient. these data further confirm that the RSPs formed in HeLa-prME are secreted into culture medium from which they can be easily purified by ultracentrifugation. concentration of RSPs from cell supernatant on PVDF membranes was around 500\u20131000 ng/ml. we then screened a siRNA library that consisted of 122 genes. non-targeting siRNA (NT) and siRNA targeting DV1 prME were added as controls. some genes whose down-regulation enhanced levels of DV RSPs in the supernatant are involved in endocytosis. these proteins are involved in the budding process or in the transport of vesicles. such an enhancement might have been due, at least in part, to a blockade in the re-internalization of secreted RSPs by HeLa-prME cells. DV4 RSPs were first produced in 293T cells by transient expression of prME genes. the codon usage of DV2, DV3 and DV4 prME genes differed substantially from that of mammalian cells. the codon usage of DV1 was optimized as described for DV1. supernatants from parental 293T and HeLa cells were used as controls. cleavage of prM was much more effective in RSPs from the HeLa-prME cell lines. results show efficacy of maturation is cell type dependent. DVs were centrifuged in a 20 to 60% sucrose gradient at 28,000 rpm for 2.5 hours in 4\u00b0C. the percentage of E protein in each fraction is displayed on the Y axis. previous studies had reported the production of DV RSPs in which the glycoproteins were mutated. cleavage was sensitive to NH4Cl treatment, which inhibits acidification of the trans-Golgi compartment. newly synthesized E proteins first form heterodimers with prM proteins in the ER of host cells. rearrangement from heterodimer to homodimer was first thought to require cleavage of prM by furin. saturating signals in the ER would mask its detection in other compartments along the secretory pathway. analysis of cell sections by transmission electron microscopy revealed that E proteins in the ER are associated with both round particles and tubular structures. tubules could either be intermediate forms of RSPs assembly or result from accumulation of prM and E proteins in the ER. a number of genes involved in the secretory pathway resulted in reduced release of RSPs in the cell supernatant. a number of genes involved in the secretory pathway resulted in reduced release of RSPs in the cell supernatant, whereas other factors were associated with an opposite effect. pCHMWS-prME-opt-IRES-Hygromycin, pcDNA-VSV-G and p8.71 (modified HIV provirus coding for gag and polymerase) plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells. two days after infection, cells were selected in culture medium containing 500 g/ml of hygromycin for two weeks. cells were then washed and incubated for 30 minutes with a goat anti-mouse IgG (H+L) fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated secondary antibody (1200; ZYMED). cell lines were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with anti-DV human sera (1200) and anti-Erp72 Rabbit polyclonal Ab (1200, stressgen bioreagents, Ann Arbor, MI, USA. ultrathin sections were cut with a leica Ultramicrotome UCT (Leica Microsystems; Vienna, Austria) sections were stained 45 minutes with 4% aqueous uranyl acetate and 5 minutes with lead citrate. for immuno-EM, cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). supernatants were then concentrated by ultracentrifugation at 28,000 rpm for 2.5 hours. pellets were then resuspended in 100 l of Phosphate buffered saline. pcDNA constructs containing optimized prME genes were transfected separately. proteins were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride membranes. membrane was blocked overnight in 5% milk in PBST solution. then incubated with anti-e antibody (4E11, 11000) for 1 hour. membrane was visualized using Western blot detection reagents.
