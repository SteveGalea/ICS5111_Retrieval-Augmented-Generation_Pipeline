{"summary": "two commonly-used conjugation approaches for generation of ADCs result in heterogeneous preparations and possible adverse effects on antigen binding and other physicochemical properties. most human IgG molecules have four interchain disulfide bonds and variations in solvent-exposure of cysteines. enzymatic method of bio-conjugation via glycan chains of the antigen-targeting antibody J591 with the positron-emitting 89Zr was previously described. recently this enzymatic method of bio-conjugation via glycan chains of the prostate specific membrane antigen-targeting antibody J591 was used for detection of tumors in nude mice. the fully degalactosylated IgG1 contains four GlcNAc residues per IgG1 molecule. the chemically reactive C2-keto-gal sugar handle is used to conjugate the drug molecule AF via a non-cleavable linker. five different Fabs showed specific binding activity to recombinant HER2 ectodomain. m860 Fab could not be competed by Trastuzumab at 20g/ml. m860 IgG1 at the same concentration potently outcompeted the binding of m860 Fab to HER2. oligosaccharides released after the PNGase F treatment showed two main peaks at m/z 1484 and 1648 corresponding to the G0F and G1F glycoforms. incubation for 24 h of 5 mg/ml1 of IgG1 m860 with 50 mU units of the galactosidase in 50 l incubation mixture completely converted the N-glycans on IgG1 m860 into G0F glycoform. mutant enzyme 1,4Gal-T1-Y289L and UDP-2-keto-Gal were used as sugar donor. a peak at 1889 corresponds to the G2F glycoform. a peak at 3637 m/z corresponds to conjugated glycan with both arms. the keto-containing m860 IgG was synthesized and attached to the AF. the heavy chain of the ADC has a mass 1747 Da larger than the keto group carrying IgG1 m860 heavy chain. this corresponds to the mass of two drug molecules with linker (nAF) per heavy chain. biacore analysis was performed to measure binding affinities of m860ADC and IgG1 m860 to FcRIIIa and FcRI. binding activity of IgG1 m860 to HER2 on SK-BR-3 was not affected by the drug conjugation to N-glycans attached to Fc. m860ADC potently killed SK-BR-3 cells, but only moderately killed MCF-7 cells at relatively high concentrations. the free drug with linker killed both SK-BR-3 cells and MCF-7 cells with similar potency. both m860ADC and T-DM1 can kill target cells with similar potency. the free drug with linker alone shows significant cytotoxicity to MCF-7 cells (IC50 0.26nM) m860ADC can still potently kill JIMT-1 cells (IC50 0.087nM), while the IgG1 m860 alone has little effect on the cells. the results indicate that there was no activity loss or specificity change after 30 d incubation in human serum (Fig. 7E and 7F). if there was free drug released from the ADC and not associated with serum proteins it would have had toxicity. IgG1 m860 is a three-dimensional molecular model of the m860-nAF ADC. heavy and light chains of IgG1 m860 are shown in yellow and cyan. four nAF molecules are shown as red spheres. mass spectrometry analysis of glycans in native and -galactosidase-treated IgG1 m860 showed two main peaks at m/z 1484 and 1648 corresponding to the G0F and G1F glycoforms. the degree to which the glycans were degalactosylated was confirmed by MALDI-TOF analysis of the N-glycans after PNGase F treatment. mU units of the galactosidase in 50 l incubation mixture completely converted the N-glycans on IgG1 m860 into G0F glycoform. MALDI-TOF analysis of N-glycans released by PNGase F treatment of native IgG1 m860. the transfer of the UDP-keto-Gal by the mutant enzyme 1,4Gal-T1-Y289L to both arms of the G0F glycoform was observed as a main peak at m/z 1889. peak at 1889.6 m/z corresponds to modified G2F glycoform carrying the keto groups. tized AF (3 mM) in 100 mM sodium acetate buffer, pH 4.5, at 37 \u00b0C for 60 h, followed by purification with a size exclusion column. the heavy chain of the ADC has a mass 1747 Da larger than the keto group carrying IgG1 m860 heavy chain. this corresponds to the mass of two drug molecules with linker (nAF) per heavy chain. biacore analysis was performed to measure binding affinities of m860ADC and IgG1 m860 to FcRIIIa and FcRI. their affinity constants of binding to FcRIIIa and FcRI are similar before and after the N-glycan-specific conjugation. the binding activity of IgG1 m860 to HER2 on SK-BR-3 was not affected by the drug conjugation to N-glycans attached to F m860ADC specifically kills HER2-overexpressing cancer cells. m860ADC potently killed SK-BR-3 cells, but only moderately killed MCF-7 cells at relatively high concentrations. the free drug with linker killed both SK-BR-3 cells and MCF-7 cells with similar potency. m860ADC can still potently kill JIMT-1 cells (IC50 0.087nM) the IgG1 m860 alone has little effect on the cells. the IC50s for m860ADC and T-DM1 are respectively 0.038nM and 0.095nM. we did not purify the ADC from drug released from the ADC. the rationale is that the free drug is bound to serum protein and cannot exert the same level of toxicity. therefore, if there was free drug released from the ADC it would have had toxicity. 0 are shown in yellow and cyan, respectively, and four nAF molecules are shown as red spheres. amino acids critical for binding to m860ADC have been studied for decades. chemistry-based oxidation of oligosaccharides is hard to control. mannose-only glycans, i.e., antibodies without drug molecules, should be less than 1%. the mechanism of the off-target toxicities for ADC biotherapeutics is at least in part driven by the carbohydrates, specifically agalactosylated glycans, such as G0F. acids identified as critical from previous studies including the residues S239, D265, D270, E293, Y296 and N297 which when altered can abrogate or reduce the ability of IgG1 to bind to FcRIIIa. the binding of the C1q subunit to the Fc region is the first step of complement activation. m860ADC model suggests drug conjugation may not disrupt the secondary effector and complement function. mAb-based ADC could also have potential as a cancer therapeutic.
