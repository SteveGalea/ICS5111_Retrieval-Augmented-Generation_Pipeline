{"summary": "all five administrative regions of Brazil were chosen as local of study because they present different socioeconomic and environmental patterns which may influence virus circulation. the climate in the Midwest region (14,993,194 inhabitants) is predominantly tropical, with a rainy season between November and March (monthly rainfall between 13.1-255.6 10-3 m) the surveillance units record at least five samples of nasophar- yngeal secretions weekly from patients with influenza-like illness. samples are processed by using indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) including tests for influenza A and B; parainfluenza 1, 2 and 3; adenovirus; and RSV. the hospitalisation rates were calculated by dividing the number of admissions of infants less than 5 years old (under the aforementioned causes) by the annual population in the same age range, estimated by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics. plots were made to visualise time parameters and seasonal trends. statistical analysis was performed using SPSS v. 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL) software. the plots were constructed using Microsoft Office 2013 (Microsoft Corporation) indirect immunofluorescence assays of samples of nasopharyngeal secretions collected by the SIVEP-GRIPE between 2005 and 2012 in infants less than 5 years old. nasopharyngeal secretions were collected between 2005 and 2012 in infants less than 5 years old. the timescale on the left represents the time in years in an algorithmic scale of base 2.

(b) global wavelet spectrum (black line) with a significance limit of alpha = 5% (pink). the RSV peak occurred in the North and Midwest regions in the second week of April (peak = 4.4), in the Northeast in the first week of May (peak = 5.1), in the Southeast in the beginning of April, and in the South in the first week of June (peak = 6.2; Table II). the month with the largest number of positive samples (median) for each region of Brazil during 2005-2012. the most appropriate dates for starting immunoprophylaxis with palivizumab for each region of Brazil are compared with the recent indication by Brazilian Ministry of Health. there are differences in the months suggested for the beginning of therapy with palivizumab in the five regions of Brazil. the use of syndormic surveillance enables identification of underreporting or a delay in reporting, through observation of trends in the occurrence of the disease. the secondary peaks do not seem to be artifacts. the readjustment of the immunisation schedule with palivizumab aims to ensure the protection of higher risk children. scheduling of other non-pharmacological interventions can interfere with the transmission of RSV. some limitations of this study can be indicated. the hospitalisation rates for bronchiolitis respiratory diseases associated with RSV can be considered an indicator that indirectly reflects the risk of circulation of RSV in the community. there is no laboratory confirmation of these clinical conditions in the routine of hospital care in the country."}
