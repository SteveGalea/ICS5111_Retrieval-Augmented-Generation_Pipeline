{"summary": "this review is about viral infections in animals. it aims first to give an idea of the enormous complexity and diversity of existing infectious agents. it focuses on how environmental changes occurring in recent times have precise effects on the emergence and evolution of infectious diseases. the complexity of viruses of plants, bacteria, fungi, and parasites is not lower than that of animal viruses. the complexity of viruses of plants, bacteria, fungi, and parasites is not lower than that of animal viruses. this gives a rough idea of the real complexity of the virus world in which only a small part is known. the term emerging infectious diseases applies to diseases in which any of the following situations is applicable: (1) a known infection spreading to a new geographic area or population, (2) a new infection that occurs as a result of evolution or change of an existing pathogen. factors determining the emergence of an infectious disease are largely unknown, although they are related to the adaptation of infectious agents to new species. avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 of Asian origin (H5N1 HPAIV) is present on three continents. it affects severely different species of domestic poultry, causing enormous losses to poultry industry. but transmission of H5N1 HPAIV between individuals in mammal species is not effective at all. in recent years an increase in fatal cases by these viruses in humans and livestock (pigs and horses) has been observed, but an inefficient transmission between individuals of these species has prevented further spread. in 2003, the first cases of what appeared to be a new disease entity with fatal consequences for affected humans, were diagnosed in Hong Kong. the way a virus survives in the environment is the result of an adaptation that largely determines how it is transmitted. the progress of a viral infection in a population is a multifactorial process, depending on a range of both biotic and abiotic factors. arthropod vectors are distributed necessarily in areas where populations of competent vectors are abundant enough. this is particularly important for arthropod-borne diseases, where environmental changes can influence both their geographic range and the risk of introduction. global change comprises not only impacts on climate, but also on the water cycle, land use, biodiversity loss, invasion of alien species into new territories, etc. environmental changes largely determine evolution of many emerging infectious diseases, mostnotably arthropod-borne ones. intercontinental transport by air makes it possible to move persons and goods thousands of miles away within few hours. for a person who has just acquired an infection it is possible to arrive to destination even within the incubation period, and develop (and transmit) the disease upon arrival. this occurs similarly as a result of trade of live animals and their products. tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus) is a competent vector of many pathogens, including dengue, yellow fever, chikungunya, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, and WNF. a growing human population is demanding more resources necessary for its supply and welfare. irrigation plans, construction of dams, etc. have a direct effect on the abundance of competent vectors for transmission of various arboviruses. the new irrigation in northwestern Australia seem to be the main cause of the recent expansion of Murray Valley fever in that country. BVDV is highly prevalent in cattle and certain variants remain unnoticed in cell cultures. some batches of fetal calf serum from BVDV-infected animals were used inadvertently, resulting in viral diarrhea in vaccinated cattle. regulatory agencies have modified their safety requirements to control specifically the risk of contamination by animal pestiviruses. table 2 summarizes the most marked trends for Europe in the next 100 years. the study suggests there will be more droughts, more wildfires, heat waves will be more frequent, and all this will be particularly noticeable in southern Europe. winters will become milder, and this will occur more rapidly in northern latitudes. long-term climatic trends in Europe will be based on data from PRUDENCE*. the consequences of global warming are expected to be diverse and highly variable in different geographical locations. a significant decline in economic activity could lead to a decrease in population, food demand, and hence livestock. even in specific cases a disease may be exacerbated transiently and disappear later. disuse and neglect could favor the accumulation of organic matter in certain points of these infrastructures, turning them into optimal habitats for breeding of vectors. the number of existing mammalian herpesvirus species would be huge, probably in the range of thousands. there are also herpesviruses specific for birds, reptiles, amphibians, etc., so the above number would be increased consequently with the number of other vertebrate species. the term emerging infectious diseases applies to diseases in which any of the following situations is applicable. there are viruses with a wide range of hosts, for example, west Nile virus (WNV), capable of infecting hundreds of species of birds, as well as many species of mammals, reptiles, and amphibians. avian influenza virus subtype H5N1 of Asian origin (H5N1 HPAIV) is present on three continents. the pathogen completes its cycle and survives normally in a given species. this occurs in a number of zoonoses, causing disease in these hosts. swine vesicular disease virus is closely related genetically to a human enterovirus. current evidence suggests that it arose as a result of a relatively recent adaptation from human to swine. other viruses that have recently emerged to affect new species are several variants of the genus Henipavirus. the environment of viruses is constituted essentially by the cells they infect. outside cells, viruses lack of activity, although to allow transmission to another individual they need to survive outside the cell. the way a virus survives in the environment is the result of an adaptation that largely determines how it is transmitted. the progress of a viral infection in a population is a multifactorial process. a particular case of this type of transmission is represented by the fecal\u2013oral route. a particular case of this type of transmission is represented by the fecal\u2013oral route (often water, food, or objects are contaminated by fecal waste) a particular case of this type of transmission is represented by the fecal\u2013oral route (often water, food, or objects are contaminated by fecal waste) environmental changes are driven by both abiotic and biotic factors. impact caused by humans has gained importance as the human population has risen. global change comprises not only impacts on climate, but also on water cycle, land use, biodiversity loss, invasion of alien species into new territories, introduction of new chemicals in Nature, etc. ranked by the number of pathogen species associated with them (most to least) intercontinental transport by air makes it possible to move persons and goods thousands of miles away within few hours. ranked by the number of pathogen species associated with them (most to least) two mountain hawk eagles (Spizaetus nipalensis) were found to be infected with the virus. illegal trafficking of animals, including exotic species, must also be considered as a relevant factor in importation of transboundary diseases. a good example was given in 2003 by the occurrence of monkeypox in humans in the united states. deforestation and biodiversity loss are often cited as causes of increased incidence of emerging infections in certain regions. changes in water use are, nevertheless, one of the factors most clearly related to the modification of eco-epidemiological patterns accompanying emerging infectious diseases. the construction of dams may have caused an important impact on the recent emergence of Murray Valley fever in East Africa. BVDV is highly prevalent in cattle and certain variants of the virus remain unnoticed in cell cultures. some batches of fetal calf serum from BVDV-infected animals were used inadvertently, resulting in viral contamination of vaccines. the rise in average surface temperature of the earth observed in the last decades. the impact of global warming on the environment is the subject of numerous recent studies, based on predictive modeling scenarios depending on the level of emissions. the study suggests there will be more droughts, more wildfires, heat waves will be more frequent, and all this will be particularly noticeable in southern Europe. winters will become milder, and this will occur more rapidly in northern latitudes. extreme temperatures (both cold and heat) will become more frequent. torrential rains, especially in summer, will become more common in southern Europe. extreme wind events (hurricanes, cyclones) will also be more frequent. a significant decline in economic activity could lead to a decrease in population, food demand, and hence livestock. a significant decline in economic activity could lead to a decrease in population, food demand, and hence livestock. a significant decline in economic activity could lead to a decrease in population, food demand, and hence livestock. BLUETONGUE THE VIRUS AND THE DISEASE Bluetongue is a non-contagious infectious disease of ruminants. BT is an economically important disease for livestock and is subject to strict regulations regarding the trade of animals and their products. clinical manifestations range from subclinical infection to acute illness that can be fatal. transmission is through the bite of midges of the genus Culicoides. 26 serotypes of BTV have been described, with no cross-protective immunity. viremia is transient, starting at 3\u20135 days after infection in sheep. serogroup-specific antibodies are directed primarily to the VP7 protein of the virus capsid. the presence of specific antibodies in serum samples is another common diagnostic test. there are live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, which are specific for each serotype. the distribution and abundance of Culicoides species involved in BTV transmission matches with the distribution of the disease in endemic areas. seasonality strongly influences vector populations throughout the year, and this determines periods of occurrence of disease cases. in temperate zones of the northern Hemisphere most cases of disease occur between August and November. wind blows can drag swarms of Culicoides midges, and bring them hundreds of kilometers away. this form of dispersal is the most likely way BTV has reached the shores of southern Europe from Africa in many occasions in the last years. for the transmission to occur the virus must replicate in the host to reach a minimum level of viremia. the role of wild ruminants in the eco-epidemiology of BTV is less known. BT burst into the Iberian peninsula from Africa, causing major losses in sheep. in 1956, BT burst into the Iberian peninsula from Africa. between 1998 and 2001, BT outbreaks were declared in the territories of Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, Macedonia, Serbia, Croatia, Montenegro, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Albania, Italy, France, and Spain. four of them (1, 2, 4, 9, and 16) came from the East (Middle East), and two more introductions from the South (Africa) involved serotypes 2 and 4. even during this period the disease showed some expansion to the North, breaking the northern limit of the the epidemic of BTV8 in Europe was unusual not only because of the latitude in which it occurred, immediately suggesting that vectors involved in transmission should be different from those \u201cexpected\u201d and more common in southern Europe (C. imicola) the virus was adapted to midge species more common in northern Europe, such as those of the C. obsoletus complex (Wilson and Mellor, 2008). new incursions of different BTVs continue threatening Europe, a continent that will no longer be considered out of reach of BT. some important trends observed in this period are: (1) a major increase in the frequency of BTV incursion events in Europe, (2) a geographic expansion of the disease, reaching latitudes close to parallel 55\u00b0N. some authors have not observed expansions of this vector in Italy in recent years. other likely competent vector species for BT present in Europe are C. obsoletus, C. pulicaris, C. scoticus, and C. dewulfii. climate change alone is insufficient to explain the whole picture. this \u201cgap\u201d indicates clearly that more sequence data are needed to draw any conclusion about the origin of the European BTV-8 strain. the trade of animals and animal products, as well as of wildlife (either legal or illegal) may be behind many accidental introduction of infectious diseases. cattle included in the list of notifiable diseases to the OIE. expression of BT disease reflects a variety of virus, host, and vector factors. sheep include pyrexia, tachypnea, nasal discharge, and lethargy. viremia is transient, starting at 3\u20135 days after infection in sheep. the duration of viremia is variable, depending on the species affected. viremia occurs between 1 and 2 weeks after infection. the presence of specific antibodies in serum samples is another common diagnostic test. there are live attenuated and inactivated vaccines, which are specific for each serotype. to be transmitted, BTV must infect a competent Culicoides vector. the optimal range of temperature lies between 13 and 35\u00b0C. excessively high (above 40\u00b0C) or low (0\u00b0C) temperatures are lethal in a short period of time. winter survival is favored by mild, frost-free, winters. a wide range of wild ruminant species are susceptible to the infection, but only a few suffer from severe disease. the role of wild ruminants in the eco-epidemiology of BTV is less known. the role of wild ruminants in the eco-epidemiology of the disease is less known. regions with suitable conditions for incursions of BT were the south of the Iberian and Italian Peninsulas and some islands of the Aegean Sea. BT burst into the Iberian Peninsula from Africa, causing major losses in sheep. in 1956, BT burst into the Iberian Peninsula from Africa, causing major losses in sheep. BT was the first occurrence of this serotype in Europe in 2006. the disease has since spread with unprecedented speed and virulence. the number of outbreaks produced by this BTV8 in Europe since its first detection in 2006 is 89,136. recent occurrence of BT in Europe has not been limited to the, otherwise outstanding, BTV8 epizootic. other serotypes have reached the shores of the southern european countries and caused severe harm to livestock. some studies indicate that the distribution of C. imicola, the principal vector of BTV in southern Europe, has undergone a geographic expansion. some studies indicate that the distribution of C. imicola, the principal vector of BTV in southern Europe, has undergone a geographic expansion, reaching areas where it had never been observed. climate change alone is insufficient to explain the whole picture regarding the current rise of BT in Europe. the wind can drag swarms of infected Culicoides, spreading the disease to considerable distances, and that is likely route of entry of BT in southern Europe. the most similar strain found is a strain from sub-Saharan Africa (Nigeria) isolated in 1982. bluetongue is no longer a tropical disease, exotic, typical of warm countries, but has come to stay in Europe. this radical change cannot be understood without taking into account global changes that are taking place in the world. current knowledge indicates that this climatic change will become increasingly intense in the future. so-called \u201cnon-structural\u201d play important roles in intracellular processes of replication, morphogenesis, and virus assembly. E protein contains the major antigenic determinants of the virus. two main genetic variants or lineages can be distinguished, namely lineages 1 and 2. west Nile fever/encephalitis is a disease transmitted mainly by mosquitoes, while wild birds are its natural reservoir. birds were considered less susceptible to the disease until the recent epidemic of WNV in north America made to re-examine this concept. advanced age is considered a risk factor for developing severe WNV infection or death. the mortality rate calculated for the recent epidemic of the disease in the united states is 1 in every 24 human cases diagnosed. the virus has been shown to infect frogs (Rana ridibunda), which in turn are bitten by mosquitoes. the existence of an enzootic cycle in these amphibians is postulated. guinea pigs, rabbits, and adult rats are resistant to infection. in epidemiological surveillance it is useful to detect the presence of WNV in mosquitoes. specific antibodies against the virus are detectable in blood few days after infection. the fight against this disease is not straightforward because there are no vaccines licensed for human use. in north America the virus has been found infecting 284 different species of birds and 59 species of mosquitoes. of these not more than 10 have a relevant role as vectors. transovarial transmission of the virus has been shown to occur in at least some Culex species. iatrogenic (through transfusions and transplants) are well documented. birds are the natural reservoirs of WNV. once infected, they are able to replicate the virus in sufficient quantity. based on circumstantial evidence, such as the discovery of an infected flock of storks in Israel in summer 1998 on their migration back to Africa from central Europe. phylogenetic studies between isolates from recent outbreaks in Europe and isolates from central africa suggest that birds that migrate between continents may act carrying the virus. however, its frequency does not seem to be as high as to explain every WNV outbreak found in Europe. between 1962 and 1965 there were several outbreaks of severe illness due to WNV in the Camargue, France. between 1962 and 1965 there were several outbreaks of severe illness due to WNV in the Camargue, France. after that, WNV in Europe remained silent for almost three decades. sporadic outbreaks have occurred in the same locations in consecutive years. since the late 1990s sporadic outbreaks have occurred in the same locations since 2000 or before. virus is genetically different from the variant affecting central Europe. virus has been able to remain endemic and spread in the area during all these years. in fact there are more countries affected than ever in Europe. the number of clinical cases is higher in the present epidemic wave. WNV is now considered endemic in North America, after continuous circulation for 12 consecutive seasons and in its southward advance has produced sporadic disease cases in central America and the Caribbean. in south America the virus has remained unnoticed, except for an outbreak in horses in Argentina in 2006. the reason why WNV circulates with such great intensity in North America, currently has no explanation. several seasons (1997\u20132002) with extremely hot summers followed by mild winters, the circulation of WNV was enhanced. two upcoming harsh winters disrupted this circulation and caused that lineage 1 WNV ceased its activity and extinguished. this time the virus circulating did not belong to the classic lineage 1, but to a newly introduced variant, which was identified as lineage 2. emergence of new virus phenotypes, more virulent and/or more transmissible and/or more adapted to their hosts and/or vectors, could play an important role. other factors related to globalization, such as increase of transport, animal movements, etc., are likely to be involved in the observed geographical expansion of WNV. three proteins (C, E, and M) form part of the structure of the virion. the rest (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, NS4a, NS4b, and NS5) are so-called \u201cnon-structural\u201d and play important roles in the intracellular processes of replication, morphogenesis. west Nile fever/encephalitis is a disease transmitted mainly by mosquitoes. wild birds are its natural reservoir. WNV is capable of infecting a wide range of bird species. advanced age is considered a risk factor for developing severe WNV infection or death. the mortality rate calculated for the recent epidemic of the disease in the u.s. is 1 in every 24 human cases diagnosed. WNV has been isolated from camels, cows, and dogs in enzootic foci. the virus has been shown to infect frogs, which in turn are bitten by mosquitoes. the existence of an enzootic cycle in these amphibians is postulated. the virus is evidenced by virological (virus isolation) or molecular (RT-PCR-conventional and real-time, NASBA) techniques. it is useful to detect the presence of WNV in mosquitoes. specific antibodies against the virus are detectable in blood few days after infection. west Nile virus is maintained in nature in an enzootic cycle between its natural reservoirs, wild birds, and ornithophilic mosquitoes acting as vectors. in north America the virus has been found infecting 284 different species of birds and 59 species of mosquitoes. this wide host and vector ranges probably facilitate the colonization of vast areas. birds are the natural reservoirs of WNV. once infected, they are able to replicate the virus in sufficient quantity. this is not the case of mammals, in general poorly effective as hosts for the virus. long distance geographic dispersal of WNV by migrating birds is a hypothesis based mainly on circumstantial evidence. this hypothesis is supported by molecular phylogenetic studies between isolates from recent outbreaks in Europe and isolates from central Africa. however, its frequency does not seem to be as high as to explain every WNV outbreak found in Europe. WNV was associated to severe cases of encephalitis, some fatal, in the first epidemic of WNV outside Africa. the virus circulated in Egypt in the same period, where the first eco-epidemiological studies on WNV were carried out. between 1962 and 1965 there were several outbreaks of severe illness due to WNV in the Camargue, France, affecting both horses and humans. this new wave of WNV in Europe differed from the former in several aspects. since the late 1990s sporadic outbreaks have occurred in the same locations in consecutive years. sporadic outbreaks have occurred in the same locations since 2000 or before. all the viruses isolated since 1996 from western Mediterranean countries have a close phylogenetic relationship. a single introduction in the area of a virus which has been able to remain endemic and spread in the area during all these years. in fact there are more countries affected than ever in Europe. only in the united states the virus has caused about 30,000 clinical cases in humans of which more than 1,000 were fatal. the disease incidence peaked in 2004 and since then a slow decline in clinical cases has been observed. the reason why WNV circulates with such great intensity in North America, currently has no explanation. abnormally dry and hot summers favor WNV circulation, while extremely cold winters break WNV cycle and disrupt its transmission. a prolonged drought after a heavy rainy season promotes the habitat of Culex vectors by enhancing accumulation of organic matter in suspension in standing water. a prolonged drought after a heavy rainy season promotes the habitat of Culex vectors by enhancing accumulation of organic matter. emergence of new virus phenotypes, more virulent and/or more transmissible and/or more adapted to their hosts and/or vectors, could play an important role. some arboviral animal diseases such as BT and WNF have undergone significant changes in their known epidemiology, gaining unprecedented importance in the past 15 years. d as potential conflict of interest."}
