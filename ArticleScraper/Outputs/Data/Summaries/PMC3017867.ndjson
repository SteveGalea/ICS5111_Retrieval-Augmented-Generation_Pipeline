{"summary": "Array-based methods have proven utility to detect in a single assay any microbe from the thousands that have been sequenced. the array has broader coverage of bacterial and viral targets and is based on more recent sequence data. microbial genomes are difficult and time-consuming to characterize when they have no similarity to known sequences. microbial detection arrays can tell what organisms are present, while functional arrays can tell what capabilities those organisms might possess. microbial genomes are difficult and time-consuming to characterize when they have no similarity to known sequences. Arrays can also be applied to study clinical samples for which PCR diagnostics have been uninformative. arrays can assist in uncovering co-infections with more than one organism. arrays can also be used to check isolate stocks and vaccines for adventitious contaminants. oligo technology limits the number of probes that can be included on one array. a subset of 72 probes targeting the coronavirus, flavivirus, and enterovirus families against pure cultures of six species. the array was designed using the Agilent ink-jet system. ed death performed less well with bacterial samples, because probes against the 16S rRNA variable regions frequently cross-hybridized across taxa. Array design to fit all probes to span an entire kingdom requires substantial investment in probe selection algorithms. we designed arrays with larger numbers of probes per sequence than previous arrays having only 2-10 probes per target. the large number of probes per target was expected to improve sensitivity, an important consideration given possible amplification bias in the random PCR sample preparation protocol. the algorithm is designed to enable quantifiable predictions of likelihood for the presence of multiple organisms in a complex sample. the results are more robust in the presence of noisy data, since the outcome variable is a probability rather than the actual intensity. log2 intensities for target-specific probes either cluster with the control and nonspecific probes. this occurs because detection array probes are designed for high sensitivity to low target concentrations, so that probe intensities approach the saturation level whenever a probe has significant similarity to a target in the sample. a dashed line with the resulting slope and intercept is shown in the plot. the figure shows that the trimer entropy is an excellent predictor of the non-specific positive signal probability. the target-specific signal probability depends on the probe sequence only. the likelihood maximization algorithm is an iterative process. in each subsequent iteration, we select the target that explains the largest part of the signal not already explained by the first target. the process continues until a maximum portion of the observed probe signals are explained. clinical fecal sample 2_2, provided by the DeRisi lab at UCSF, analyzed on MDA v.2. the larger \"expected\" score is obtained by summing the positive signal probabilities for all probes. the smaller \"detected\" score is derived by limiting this sum to probes having positive signals. the highest scoring targets in the single virus experiments were adenovirus, BVDV, vaccinia and human herpesvirus 6B. human endogenous retrovirus K113 was also detected in two of the three mixtures, possibly from host cell DNA. e negative error rates were estimated for MDA v.1 from experiments with sequenced viruses. all 128 selected probes had signals above the 99th percentile detection threshold, yielding zero false negative error rate. genome sequences for these were not included in the probe design because they became available only after we designed the microarray probes or because they were not classified into a bacterial taxonomic family. these sequences were included in the analysis database, since this database included sequences not classified as to bacterial family. unpublished assays developed by colleagues at LLNL and tested by LLNL colleagues at Plum Island that specifically detect VSV NJ. there were 7 probes from the ViroChip corresponding to VSV NJ that were detected. 141 probes were detected in a majority of arrays hybridized to a wide variety of sample types. a small number of these probes were found to have significant BLAST hits to the human genome. the vast majority of sticky probes were not explained by cross-hybridization. a strong signal indicating the presence of hepatitis B virus was detected in sample 1_5 (Figure 7) in all the remaining samples, signals were detected for a mixture of viruses and bacteria. a strong signal indicating the presence of hepatitis B virus was detected in sample 1_5 (Figure 7) we designed arrays with larger numbers of probes per sequence than previous arrays having only 2-10 probes per target. the large number of probes per target was expected to improve sensitivity, an important consideration given possible amplification bias in random PCR sample preparation protocol. DA v.2 was designed using both viral and bacterial probes. low levels of sequence similarity were allowed selectively. the algorithm is designed to enable quantifiable predictions of likelihood for the presence of multiple organisms. the threshold was typically calculated as the 99th percentile of the intensities of random control probes on the array. the results are more robust in the presence of noisy data, since the outcome variable is a probability rather than the actual intensity. ization occurs more often with probes having low sequence complexity. we selected data from nine MDA v2 arrays for which all sample components had known genome sequences. we grouped probes with no BLAST hits to any of the known targets. the best combination included three covariates: predicted melting temperature, computed as described in Methods. the best combination included three covariates: the predicted melting temperature, computed as described in Methods. we performed leave-one-out validation to find the combination with the strongest predictive value. MDA v2 results for spiked mixture of vaccinia virus and HHV6B. many of the same conserved probes that hybridize to BVDV match classical swine fever virus. analysis of each array identified the known virus as the highest scoring target. adenovirus type 7, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV], and bovine viral diarrhea virus [BVDV] were hybridized to MDA v.1 arrays. analysis of each array identified the known virus as the highest scoring target. the LLNL probes identified the correct Gomen strain of human adenovirus type 7. the ViroChip probes identified the correct species but the incorrect NHRC 1315 strain. false negative error rates were estimated for MDA v.1 from experiments. a mixture of vaccinia Lister and HHV 6B were correctly identified to the species level. Virus sequences selected as likely to be present were highlighted in red. several organisms that were unlikely to be present were predicted. ten of 11 of the species predicted by the MDA were confirmed by Dr. Tesh. endogenous retroviruses were also detected in 7 of the samples. vesicular stomatitis virus, NJ (VSV NJ) was present in the sample. CTF Colorado tick fever virus TVP-11184 Cache Valley genome RNA for N and NSs proteins TVP-11185 Ilheus Ilheus virus TVP-11186 EHD-NJ Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus isolate 1999_MS-B NS3 TVP-11187 SF Sicilian Sandfly fever Sicilian virus TVP-11189 VSV-NJ Not detected TVP-11189 Ross River virus Detection of viruses and bacteria from clinical samples. samples tested on the array were either human clinical samples or were grown in vero cells (an African green monkey cell line) the frequent high signals for these few probes can be explained by the presence of primate DNA in the sample. sticky probes had smaller entropies and more negative free energies. in a genus have similarly high log-odds ratios, suggesting that a member of that genus is likely to be present. we expect that this pattern could arise in cases where a novel unsequenced isolate from the genus is present. conservation at the genus level is sufficiently high that the conserved probes do not provide species discrimination. the MDA v.2 has higher probe density and larger phylogenetic representation of viral and bacterial sequenced genomes than other published array designs. it can be applied to problems in viral and bacterial detection from pure or complex environmental or clinical samples. the p-values for the positive probes associated with each taxon are multiplied. candidate taxa are ranked by the aggregate p-value. the method depends heavily on the assumption that probe intensities are independent measurements. the MDA is a tool to identify viral and bacterial organisms present in simple or complex samples. we have demonstrated the capability of the array and our statistical methods to identify multiple bacteria and viruses in clinical samples. the length of longest perfect match (PM) is a strong predictor of hybridization intensity. for probes at least 50 nt long, PM 20 bp have signal less than 20% of that with a perfect match over the entire length of the probe. for each target family we eliminated regions with perfect matches to sequences outside the target family. candidate probes with unsuitable G's or Tm's were excluded as described in [2]. fewer than a minimum number of candidates per target sequence passed all the criteria, then those criteria were relaxed to allow a sufficient number of probes per target. the v.1 array contained probes representing all complete viral genomes or segments associated with a known viral family. it did not include unclassified targets not designated under a family. each viral genome or segment was represented by at least 50 probes. gene sequences of length up to 4 the protein length were downloaded from the NCBI nucleotide database based on the EMBL ID number. we designed 2,600 random control sequences that were length and GC% matched to the target probes on MDA v.1 or v.2. purified DNA from human herpesvirus 6B (HHV6B) and vaccinia virus strain Lister (Poxviridae) were purchased from the national veterinary lab. 11 blinded viral culture samples were received from LLNL in presence of Trizol reagent. the labeled samples were hybridized to NimbleGen arrays. PCR primers were designed using either the KPATH system [30] or based on the probes that gave a positive signal for the organism identified as present. the BLAST bit score Bij and the probe alignment start position Qij were extracted directly from the BLAST output. the melting temperature Tij was computed according to the formula Tij = 69.4\u00b0C + (41 NGC - 600)/L. the entropy Si of the probe sequence trimer distribution was computed by counting the numbers of occurrences nAAA, nAAC,..., nTTT of the 64 possible trimers in the probe sequence we performed an exhaustive BLAST search for every probe on the array. we then computed the covariates Bij, Tij, and Qij for each target on the array. the conditional probe signal probabilities are then combined to compute a likelihood function for the presence of a particular target. X j = 1 1 1 + e a 0 + a 1 S i + a 2 T i j + a 3 B i j + a 4 Q i j. the algorithm is initialized by placing all candidate targets in an \"unselected\" list U, and creating an empty \"selected\" list S. the selected list S will be empty, so the log-odds score for target j will not be conditioned on the presence of any other targets. we store the value of this \"final\" score j(f) for each target in S. the result of this analysis is an ordered series S of target genomes predicted to be present. the length of longest perfect match (PM) is a strong predictor of hybridization intensity. for probes at least 50 nt long, PM 20 bp have signal less than 20% of that with a perfect match over the entire length of the probe. for each target family we eliminated regions with perfect matches to sequences outside the target family. long probes improve hybridization sensitivity, alleviate sequence-dependent variation in hybridization, and improve the capability to detect unsequenced microbes. candidate probes with unsuitable G's or Tm's were excluded as described in [2]. probes detecting more targets in the family were chosen preferentially. a target was considered to be represented if a probe matched it with at least 85% sequence similarity over the total probe length. a perfectly matching subsequence of at least 29 contiguous bases spanned the middle of the probe. viral probes (50 probes/seq from each taxonomic family) replicates 12342 nonConforming viruses (not associated w/ taxonomic family, 40 probes/seq) 7864 bacterial probes (15/seq) 20736 ViroChip probes 1278 human viral response genes 2651 random controls. sample preparation and microarray hybridization DNA microarrays were synthesized using the NimbleGen maskless Array Synthesizer at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. purified DNA from human herpesvirus 6B (HHV6B) and vaccinia virus strain Lister (Poxviridae) were purchased from Advanced Biotechnologies (Maryland, VA) PCR primers were synthesized by Biosearch Technologies Inc (Novato, CA) 1 L of Round B material was re-amplified for 25 cycles. 2 L of the PCR product was used in a subsequent PCR reaction containing Platinum Taq polymerase (Invitrogen) the threshold was typically calculated as the 99th percentile of the intensities of the negative control probes. the probability of observing Yik = 1 given the presence of a specific microbial target in sample k. the linear predictor combines both nonspecific and target-specific terms: P ( Y i k = 1 | target j present ) = 1 1 + exp [ ( a 0 + a 1 S j + a 2 T i j + a 3 B i j + a 4 Q i j ) (4) where the individual probe-target signal probabilities are given. the algorithm is initialized by placing all candidate targets in an \"unselected\" list U, and creating an empty \"selected\" list S. the algorithm is then iterated until the algorithm terminates. j is the log of the ratio of likelihood of the data, if target j is added to S, to its likelihood if j is not added. the selected list S will be empty, so the computed log-odds score for target j will not be conditioned on the presence of any other targets.
