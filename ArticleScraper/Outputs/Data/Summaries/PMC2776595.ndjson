{"summary": "a particular subtype of verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) O157:H7 has been found to cause the majority of reported human infections in the past 15 years. this subtype is better adapted to colonise cattle, and thus may be excreted in greater concentrations and for longer periods than other VTEC subtypes. this subtype, VTEC O157:H7 (PT4;vtx2;vtx2c), is frequently isolated from Swedish cattle. in most calves, inoculated with a representative strain of this specific subtype, the numbers of shed bacteria declined over the first two weeks. one calf could be classified as a high-shedder, excreting high levels of the bacterium for a prolonged period. studies have shown that the prevalence of VTEC O157:H7 in faecal samples collected from cattle at slaughter is 3.4% [12]. the prevalence in cattle is highest in southwestern Sweden [13,14]. there is an ongoing discussion in Sweden about how to prevent the spread of VTEC O157:H7. the aim of this study was to investigate the magnitude and duration of faecal excretion in calves experimentally infected with VTEC O157:H7. faecal samples were tested for coronavirus and rotavirus (21 and 13 days pre inoculation), Cryptosporidium sp. (13 days pre inoculation), Salmonella spp calves were housed in a bio-containment level 3 facility at the National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala, Sweden. they were randomly assigned to three groups, housed under loose conditions in three separate stalls. they were given identification numbers I-VII; calves I, II, III in stall A, calves IV, V, VI in stall B and calf VII in stall C as a negative control. strain CCUG 53931 was cultivated at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours in nutrient broth. four inocula were prepared by transferring 1.0 ml of broth to 25 ml. samples from the pharynx were collected twice a week. all samples were collected in the afternoon and stored in refrigerated state. the analyses were started within 24 h of sampling. Isolation and typing of VTEC O157 VTEC O157:H7 was isolated from faeces by immunomagnetic separation (IMS) the detection limit by this method was estimated to 1 102 cfu/g faeces. results from samples deemed culture-positive by IMS, but negative by the quantitative analysis, were considered positive by IMS, while samples culture negative by IMS were deemed negative. faecal samples were tested, with negative results, for coronavirus and rotavirus. experimental design and housing facilities The study was performed during a 2-month period and throughout the experiment the calves were housed in a bio-containment level 3 facility. they were randomly assigned to three groups, housed under loose conditions in three separate stalls, and were given identification numbers I-VII. each stall had a floor area of 12 m2, individual floor drain and separate ventilation system. strain CCUG 53931 was cultivated at 37\u00b0C for 18 hours in nutrient broth. four inocula were prepared by transferring 1.0 ml of broth to 25 ml. samples from pharynx were collected twice a week for the remainder of the experiment. Isolation and typing of VTEC O157:H7 from swab samples was effected by pre-enriching each swab in 5 ml pre-warmed (37\u00b0C) BPW for 6-8 h at 37\u00b0C. PFGE was carried out on altogether 28 isolates. the detection limit was estimated to 1 102 cfu/g faeces. results from samples deemed culture-positive by IMS, but negative by the quantitative analysis, were considered positive by IMS, while samples culture negative by IMS were considered negative. calf VI was inoculated for the first time on day 42. samples negative on counting but culture-positive on IMS are denoted as IMS positive. samples culture-negative on IMS are denoted as IMS negative. the calves were euthanised after the last shown result of sampling. experimental animals All calves remained healthy throughout the study period and maintained a normal appetite, normal rectal temperature, were alert and responsive. Isolation of VTEC O157:H7 in faeces All 4 inoculated calves were culture positive for VTEC O157:H7 strain CCUG 53931 in faeces within 30 h pi. the 2 remaining calves were culture-negative for 8 and 10 consecutive samplings respectively. both calves were culture-positive the next day (43 pi) the shedding rate decreased quickly and on day 54 pi both calves were negative. the strain was chosen as a representative of the VTEC O157:H7 (PT4;vtx2;vtx2c) subtype. it was isolated from cattle on a farm previously linked to direct transmission of infection to man. there have been two larger human outbreaks of VTEC O157:H7 in Sweden. re-infection of calves with homologous strain led to humoral response. calf VI exhibited no shedding pattern indicative of protective immunity. this is consistent with results obtained by et al. all calves in this experiment shed the bacterium following oral administration in numbers indicative of proliferation. it is difficult to determine if this is equivalent with colonisation. but the shedding pattern observed in calf II indicates that this calf was successfully colonised. VTEC O157:H7 was recovered in satisfactory numbers. the background flora was suppressed so that the colonies became prominent. a close correlation between VTEC O157:H7 and the formation of pink-coloured colonies on ChromO157 plates has been described earlier. this subtype, VTEC O157:H7 (PT4;vtx2;vtx2c), is frequently isolated from Swedish cattle. it has also been found to cause the majority of reported human infections in Sweden during the past 15 years. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. the authors wish to thank the Swedish Research Council forMAS, the Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research, the Swedish Board of Agriculture and Sandbergska Stiftelsen. the authors also wish to thank Lisa Lindberg, Lennart Lindberg, Per Karlsson, Barbro H\u00f6gberg and the staff at the department of Bacteriology at the National Veterinary Institute, Uppsala."}
