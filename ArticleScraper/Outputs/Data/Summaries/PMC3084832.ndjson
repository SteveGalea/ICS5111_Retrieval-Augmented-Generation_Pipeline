{"summary": "melanoma is the most fatal form of skin cancer. it occurs from malignantly-transformed melanocytes in the basal layer of the epidermis. an urgent need exists for novel therapies and earlier diagnosis. antibodies for the treatment of melanoma aimed at enhancing key pathways of T cell activation (Cytotoxic T Lymphocyte-Associated Antigen 4, e.g. Ipilimumab), targeting tumor vasculature (e.g. Bevacizumab), or tumor-associated antigens (e.g. high Molecular Weight-Melanoma Associated Antigen, HMW-MAA) have demonstrated promise in clinical studies. serological analysis of cDNA expression libraries has led to the discovery of the human testis antigen HOM-MEL-40. many of these antigens are primarily intracellular, making them less attractive targets as monoclonal antibodies. serological screens may also be limited by the temporal dynamics of sera antibodies. we screen for tumor-reactive and tumor-specific IgG antibodies produced by patient and healthy individual B cell cultures. this allowed characterization beyond phenotype of the circulating B cell repertoire of individuals with melanoma. we also provide examples of clinical correlations of mature humoral responses and disease progression. melanoma cells can detect the antigen at 30 g/mL (top left), 200 ng/mL (top middle) and 20 ng/mL (top middle) no binding to melanocytes was seen (bottom left) using cell-based ELISA, we detected tumor-specific antibodies at concentrations as low 10 ng/mL. a humanized antibody specific for HER2/neu was specifically detected compared to an equal amount of a control IgG. we first established B cell cultures from the peripheral blood of melanoma patients to study antibody responses to cancer. 80% of the cells in these cultures were IgG positive. a significant (P0.0001) increase was also seen in the mean reactivity of patient-derived antibodies to primary and metastatic melanoma cells compared to healthy volunteers. reactivity of antibodies derived from melanoma patient B cells to primary and metastatic melanoma cells is compared to healthy volunteers using the cell-based ELISA. patients with local (non-metastatic, stages I and II) disease had a significantly (P0.0001) higher mean antibody response (2.6 fold increase, 95% CI = 2.4 to 2.8) compared to those with confirmed metastatic disease (stages III and IV, 1.7 fold increase, 95% CI = 1.7 to 1.8) the highest mean antibody response was observed in patients 5 and 6 diagnosed with stage II and III melanoma. patients from each stage group had B cells with antibodies that recognized tumor cells. a significant reduction in the proportion of tumor-reactive antibody cultures as a function of disease progression, patients from each stage group had B cells with antibodies that recognized tumor cells. fold increases were calculated by dividing optical density of B cell culture supernatants by optical density of a non-specific IgG negative control using a cell-based ELISA. % of cultures with absorbance values greater than 75% of a positive control antibody using a cell-based ELISA. anoma cells were selected as a positive control because of comparable binding across melanoma cell lines and melanocytes. previous studies have selected wells greater than the mean negative control optical density (OD) + three standard deviations as criteria for positive tumor-reactive antibodies. compared antibodies produced by B cells to a positive control antibody. anoma cells were estimated by limiting dilution analysis for Patient 15. the frequency of B cells producing antibodies reactive to the cells of interest was approximated according to Poisson distribution. the number of B cells at which 37% of the cultures were non-reactive was approximated according to Poisson distribution. one out of 1,790 peripheral blood B cells produces antibodies that bind to A-375 melanoma cells. for this same patient, the frequency of antibodies that react with melanocytes was also evaluated at the same B cell densities as melanoma cells. for this same patient, the frequency of antibodies that react with melanocytes was also evaluated at the same B cell densities as melanoma cells. screening for tumor-specific antibodies and selection of a Patient-derived monoclonal antibody with In Vitro Cytotoxicity against melanoma cells. we then selected patient-derived, tumor-specific antibodies based on stringent criteria (OD > 75% positive control antibody), using the cell-based ELISA. multiple antibody cultures from one patient were screened against 3 melanoma cell lines (A-375, SK-MEL-2 and WM-115) and primary melanocytes using the cell-based ELISA. fold increase values represent optical density (OD) values relative to a negative control antibody. monoclonal antibodies our B cell culture supernatants tested melanoma-cell specificity. a tumor-reactive culture from a stage III patient was sub-cloned. a monoclonal antibody 6_2G3 was selected and evaluated on live cells. two monoclonal antibodies were evaluated in vitro using a live cell imaging assay. 6_2G3 clone bound to A-375 cells compared to melanocytes. 6_2D10, a clone also from Patient 6 did not, served as a negative control antibody. images of U-937 movement in tumor cell cultures treated with 6_2G3. movement indicated by tracking lines (red to yellow) from original position of cells at t = 0 to t = 2 hours (magnification 20x, Scale bar: 50 m) after 2 hours in culture, 18% (95% CI = -5 to 41%) of tumor cells given the melanoma-specific antibody were viable. a patient-derived tumor-specific antibody is capable of engaging immune effector cells in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against tumor cells. these data suggest that systemic melanoma-specific mature B cell responses may be present in patients with melanoma and harbor the potential to be activated against cancer cells. IgG from 5% human serum did not bind to A-375 cells. Flow cytometry analysis demonstrates specific binding of the HMW-MAA antibody to melanoma cells at 30 g/mL (dashed line), 200 ng/mL (dotted line) and 20 ng/mL (solid line) but not to melanocytes (30 g/mL HMW-MAA antibody). melanoma-reactive antibodies are more prevalent in melanoma patients than healthy volunteers. we first established B cell cultures from the peripheral blood of melanoma patients to study antibody responses to cancer. 80% of the cells in these cultures were IgG positive. antibody cultures (n = 600) to metastatic melanoma cells (2.5 fold increase, 95% CI = 2.4 to 2.6) compared to antibodies from healthy volunteers. reactivity of antibodies derived from melanoma patient B cells to primary and metastatic melanoma cells is compared to healthy volunteers using cell-based ELISA. antibody reactivity against melanoma cells was quantified relative to a non-specific human IgG control. patients with local (non-metastatic, stages I and II) disease had a significantly (P0.0001) higher mean antibody response (2.6 fold increase, 95% CI = 2.4 to 2.8) compared to those with confirmed metastatic disease. stage patient ID* Age Sex Ethnicity Mean fold increase over negative control 95% CI of mean Maximum fold increase over negative control % Mean reactive cultures I 9 51 F Caucasian 1.1 1 to 1 2.8 2 II 4 75 M Caucasian 2.7 2.6 to 3 4.2 38 II 5 70 M Caucasian 6.1 5.4 to 7 17 63 II 7 69 M Caucasian 1.6 1.4 to 2 4.8 3 II 15 49 F Caucasian 2.6 2.5 to 3 6.2 22 antibody reactivity was determined using a cell-based ELISA. % of cultures with absorbance values greater than 75% of a positive control antibody using a cell-based ELISA. previous studies have selected wells greater than the mean negative control optical density (OD) + three standard deviations as criteria for positive tumor-reactive antibodies. we chose more stringent criteria for antibody screening, by comparing antibodies produced by B cells to a positive control antibody (> 75% OD of positive control) from 21 patients, each arising from 500 B cells, produced antibodies that recognized metastatic melanoma cells, compared to 2% of cultures derived from 10 healthy volunteers. frequency of melanoma-reactive B cells was estimated to be 1 in 1,790 melanoma cells (Patient 15) and 1 in 2,430 B cells (Patient 21) from our patient cohort, we estimate the frequency of melanoma-reactive antibody-producing B cells in melanoma patients. lanocytes were also evaluated at the same B cell densities as melanoma cells. we did not observe a comparable patient antibody response to melanocytes. this suggests a much lower frequency of antibodies that bind to the primary melanoma line WM-115. antibody cultures were selected based on stringent criteria (OD > 75% positive control antibody), using the cell-based ELISA. tumor specificity of antibody cultures was evaluated by comparing binding of antibodies from these cultures against multiple melanoma cells. cell culture supernatants were observed to have a higher degree of binding to melanoma cells compared to melanocytes. a monoclonal antibody was further assessed for specificity to 6 melanoma cell lines, melanocytes and fibroblasts. the antibody had no reactivity against primary human dermal fibroblasts. a selected tumor-reactive culture from a stage III patient was sub-cloned. a monoclonal antibody 6_2G3 was selected and evaluated on live cells. we wished to assess whether a patient-derived antibody has potential cytotoxic activity against tumor cells. two monoclonal antibodies were evaluated in vitro using a live cell imaging assay. 6_2G3 clone bound to A-375 cells compared to melanocytes. 6_2D10, a clone also from Patient 6 did not, served as a negative control antibody. after 2 hours in culture, 18% (95% CI = -5 to 41%) of tumor cells given the melanoma-specific antibody were viable, compared to 95% (95% CI = 86 to 104%) of the tumor cells given the non-melanoma specific antibody (P0.0001). results highlight the potential of a patient derived tumor-specific antibody to kill tumor cells by antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity. melanoma-specific mature B cell responses may be present in patients with melanoma. this strategy has the potential to be applied to any type of cancer. findings provide added insight into the mature systemic B cell response to melanoma. ELISA is an attractive tool to evaluate broad responses to any naturally-expressed antigens on the surface of melanoma cells and melanocytes. this screening methodology has additional potential advantages. cell lines provide a promising alternative source of multiple tumor antigens in the absence of multiple well-defined, highly expressed, and readily available recombinant antigens. we measured a reduction in the peripheral blood memory B cell compartment of metastatic melanoma patients compared to healthy volunteers. we showed a high prevalence of melanoma patient-derived antibodies produced by circulating B cells in cancer patients that recognize melanoma cell lines. melanoma patients had a high percentage of melanoma-reactive antibody-producing B cell cultures. dilution analyses of reactivity against melanoma cells versus normal melanocytes provided further evidence in support of the presence and frequency of tumor-reactive B cells in patient blood. findings provide further insight by demonstrating the presence of a circulating long-term mature B cell response to cancer at all disease stages. adsorption of antibodies into tumors in advanced disease setting may also explain these reductions. it is possible that our observations may reflect reactivity to antigens present in primary disease. this reduced reactivity to melanoma may imply weakened immune responses. melanoma-reactive mature memory B cells and their antibody repertoires may help identify correlations between disease progression and melanoma-reactive mature memory B cells. future studies may help identify particular components of the humoral response which may hold clinical relevance. an important question therefore relates to whether patient-derived mature B cell responses have any functional capability to potently activate immune effector cells against cancer. 2G3 clone is capable of mediating ADCC in vitro. it additionally measured the restricted movement of monocytic effector cells once in contact with tumor-specific antibody-coated tumor cells. this suggests that a potentially active mature B cell response against melanoma may be present in patients. zumab against the HER2/neu antigen expressed on 20\u201330% of breast cancers. antibodies that bind to a portion of cell lines may merit further characterization. future evaluations of clone 6_2G3 will include sequence analysis and expression cloning. B cells were plated at 500 cells per well on 96 well U-bottom microplates. plated at 1 cell/well in presence of 3x104 autologous PBMCs. the human metastatic melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 were grown in Eagle\u2019s Minimum Essential Medium. the human metastatic melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 were grown in RMPI-1640 medium. Detection of antibodies bound to cells by immunocytochemistry was performed by centrifugation of 2105 cells at 300g using a Shandon Cytospin\u00ae 4 Cytocentrifuge. cells were fixed in 0.5% formalin and antibodies, such as those recognizing the human High Molecular Weight Melanoma-Associated Antigen (anti-HMW-MAA clone LHM2) were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C and detected following a 2 hour incubation at antibodies to cells were compared to an excess of isotype control IgG1 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch, west Grove, PA) the binding of antibodies to cell surface proteins was detected following a 45 minute incubation with a goat anti-human horseradish peroxidase-labeled F(ab)\u20192 Fc-specific antibody. the color reaction was developed for 15 minutes with OPD (Sigma) and OD was measured in an ELISA reader (BMG Labtech, Offenbury, Germany) each plate contained triplicate wells of a positive control antibody, Trastuzumab (Genentech, south San Francisco, CA) and a negative control antibody, non-specific human IgG1 (Jackson Immunoresearch) at a concentration of 250 ng/mL both diluted in RPMI-16 75% of the OD of the positive control antibody was normalized against the positive control. the mean positive control OD was assigned a relative absorbance of 1 for each plate. culture wells with relative absorbance values greater than 0.75 to melanoma cells were selected. U-937 monocytic cells expressing Fc receptors were used as immune effector cells at a ratio of 3:1. monocytes were incubated with the 6_2G3 or 6_2D10 antibody for 30 minutes. images were captured every 5 minutes for two hours in a humidified temperature controlled chamber. a two-sided Student\u2019s t test was used to compare antibody-mediated tumor cell killing between tumor-specific and non-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from the same patient. a two-sided Student\u2019s t test was also employed to compare the movement of immune effector cells in contact with tumor cells to the movement of immune cells not in contact with tumor cells. B cells were plated at 500 cells per well on 96 well U-bottom microplates. we plated 3x104 cells per well of irradiated autologous PBMCs. cells were grown in RPMI-1640 medium obtained from Gibco (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the human metastatic melanoma cell lines SK-MEL-2 and SK-MEL-28 were grown in RMPI-1640 medium. primary human melanocytes (ATCC, PCS-2000-012) were grown in Dermal Cell Basal Medium (ATCC) and supplemented with the Melanocyte Growth Kit (HER2/neu) MAA clone LHM2, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-IgG Fc-specific antibody (1:100 dilution in Tris Buffered Saline, Sigma, Dorset, UK) slides were stained with DAB chromogenic substrate (DAKO, Ely, UK) for 5 minutes, washed and counterstained with Mayer\u2019 plates were grown in a monolayer at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 to 80-100% confluence. cells were then lightly fixed in 0.5% formaldehyde/Hank\u2019s Buffered Salt Solution. plates were thawed for 30 minutes, washed 3 times with PBS and then blocked with a 5% non-fat milk/PBS solution for 2 hours. a total of 250 ng/mL were diluted in RPMI-1640 media supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. OD values for the negative non-specific human IgG control antibody formed the criteria for inclusion of readouts in the study. the percentage of non-reactive cultures was calculated for different patients and cell lines as a way to approximate the frequency of B cells producing melanoma-reactive antibodies using Poisson distribution. the tumor-killing potential of 2 patient-derived monoclonal antibodies was assessed. a two-sided Student\u2019s t test was used to compare antibody-mediated tumor cell killing between tumor-specific and non-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from the same patient. a two-sided Student\u2019s t test was used to compare antibody-mediated tumor cell killing between tumor-specific and non-specific monoclonal antibodies derived from the same patient.
