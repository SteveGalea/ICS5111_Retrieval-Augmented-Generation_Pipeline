{"summary": "candidate vaccine immunogens must be capable of eliciting broadly neutralizing antibodies (bnAbs) that inhibit viruses from different genetic subtypes. characterization of epitopes of the bnAbs could help design vaccine immunogens that would be able to elicit these bnAbs. studies show human IgM antibodies play important roles in shaping humoral immunity against HIV-1 but also in inducing cell-mediated response. a human anti-HIV-1 gp41 IgM monoclonal antibody blocked the transcytotic route of HIV mucosal transmission in vitro. phage-displayed Fab library (designated m21) was constructed from peripheral blood B cells of 22 healthy donors, spleens of 3 healthy donors, and lymph nodes of 34 healthy donors. pZYD-N1 was synthesized and briefly described previously. 44 clones were randomly selected from the library and sequenced. Fab R3H1m specifically bound with relatively high affinity to gp140R2 (EC50, 60 nM) and the gp140 of a clade C isolate, GXC44 (gp140GXC44) (EC50, 100 nM) five unique clones were identified that contained exclusively lambda light chains. they bound to gp140R2 and gp14014/00/4 with EC50 ranging from 2 to 80 nM. no significant binding to an unrelated antigen, bovine serum albumin (BSA), was observed. a positive control antibody, m36 [17], showed efficient neutralization and a negative control antibody, 1A1 did not affect entry. m19d enhanced infection by another clade B primary isolate, JRFL, at high concentrations. the in vitro activities of the selected mAbs against HIV-1 infection in a pseudovirus/cell line neutralization assay. the ability of m19Fc to modulate HIV-1 infection in vitro was further tested with six additional clade B isolates and an isolate each from clade A and clade C, respectively. enhancement was observed with JRCSF (clade B, R5) at very low m19Fc concentration and the enhancement was decreased with an increase in antibody concentration. it neutralized the clade B X4 isolates IIIB and NL4-3. gp120Bal-CD4 complex (gp120Bal-CD4) [20] with threefold higher affinity (EC50, 2.5 nM) than to gp120Bal (EC50, 10 nM) alone. the antibody did not react with sCD4 suggesting that the antibody targeted a structure on gp120 that was outside the CD4-binding site (CD4bs) v b12 has binding surface larger than that of CD4 [22]. the epitope of m19Fc is in very close proximity to the CD4bs and the coreceptor-binding site (CORbs) which overlap with CD4i epitopes on gp120 (a) and gp140Con-S (b) no apparent interaction was observed with scFv m19gem when several Envs that bound the original m19 were tested. previous studies showed that the binding activity of an antibody in the form of Fab or scFv could be increased up to thousands of times when it is converted to dimeric formats such as an IgG. however, the m19 corresponding germline antibody did not show measurable binding to the Env with or without sCD4. the phagemid used for library construction, pZYD-N1, was synthesized and briefly described previously. 44 clones were randomly selected from the library and sequenced. no identical sequences of heavy and light chains were found; more than 80% of the clones are productive. the amino acid sequences of heavy (a) and light (b) chains of the selected mAbs are indicated according to the corresponding germlines of human antibody V genes. we hypothesized that the binding activity of R3H1m should be attributed mainly to the heavy chain of the antibody. bovine serum albumin (BSA), was observed. m19 and possibly the other selected antibodies target conserved epitopes on gp120. the selected antibodies did not neutralize, neutralize weakly or enhanced HIV-1 infections. the antibodies in Fab format were tested against two clade B primary R5 isolates, Bal (a) and JRFL (b), and a clade B lab-adapted X4 isolate, IIIB (c). a CD4i human antibody domain (dAb), m36, was used as a positive control and an irrelevant human dAb targeting the human insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF-2), 1A1 was used as a negative control. enhancement was observed with JRCSF (clade B, R5) at very low m19Fc concentration. it conferred slight enhancement of infection by JRFL (clade B, R5) and 92UG037.8 (clade A, R5) at about 200 nM antibody concentration. it neutralized the clade B X4 isolates IIIB and NL4-3. m19Fc showed comparable binding to gp140Con-S with or without sCD4. m19Fc strongly competed with the CD4bs bnAb, scFv b12, which has binding surface larger than that of CD4 [22]. epitope of m19Fc is in very close proximity to the CD4bs and the coreceptor-binding site (CORbs) which overlap with CD4i epitopes on gp120Bal (a) and gp140Con-S (b) in the absence or absence of CD4. an irrelevant human antibody, 1A1, was used as a negative control. the binding activity of an antibody in the form of Fab or scFv could be increased up to thousands of times when it is converted to dimeric formats such as an IgG. however, the Fc-fusion protein of scFv m19gem (m19gemFc) did not show measurable binding to the Envs with or without sCD4. these results suggest that significant somatic diversification is required for the m19 corresponding germline antibody to achieve recognition analysis of the structures of Envs shows that most of their surface is hidden from humoral immune responses by glycosylation and oligomeric occlusion. one strategy focuses on the use of modified Envs, in which the variable loops have been deleted [26\u201329] or glycosylation removed [30,31] or both [32] in order to increase the exposure of the neutralizing epitopes. another strategy focuses on preservation or re-construction of the functional trimeric En in this study, we describe the identification and characterization of several high-affinity human IgM-derived mAbs against HIV-1 from phage-displayed naive human antibody libraries constructed from healthy donors. the antibodies selected in this study target highly conserved regions on gp120 which are in very close proximity to the CD4bs and the CORbs. this could further divert the immune system from responses to neutralizing epitopes. m19Fc partially reversed the neutralization by a CD4i antibody, m36 [17]. this results further support previous propositions to reduce the immunogenicity of unwanted epitopes when gp120/gp140 is used as an immunogen. we observed similar lack of binding of germline-like b12, 2F5 and 2G12 to Envs. gp120s also bind to a small population of human antibodies containing products of mainly VH3 gene family. the core motif of the superantigen-binding site (SBS) on gp120 is a discontinuous structure spanning the V4 variable domain and the amino-terminal region flanking the C4 constant domain. the determinants on the antibody VH domains critical for gp120 binding are not clear yet. antibodies derived from combinatorial libraries are likely to represent in vivo pairings, leading to high affinity antibody fragments mimicking the binding of serum autoantibodies to TPO. the antibodies we selected were originated from large families of genes \u2013 heavy chain from VH3 and light chain from VL1 (Figure 1). other cell lines and plasmids used for expression of various HIV-1 Envs were obtained from the National Institutes of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (ARRRP). gp120Bal and the single-chain fusion protein gp120Bal-CD4 were provided by T. Fouts. a naive human Fab library was panned sequentially with two gp140s from different clades. antigens were alternated with 5 and 2.5 g of gp14014/00/4 during the second and fourth round. the full-length original or germline scFv gene fragment was synthesized (GenScript, Piscataway, NJ) the bacterial pellet was collected after centrifugation at 5,000 g for 10 min. it was centrifuged at 25,000 g for 25 min at 4 \u00b0C. the supernatant was used for purification of scFv and Fab by immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography. the mixture was added to 1.5 104 HOS-CD4-CCR5 or HOS-CD4-CXCR4 cells grown in each well of 96-well plates. gp120, gp140, and antibodies were obtained from the National Institute of Health AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program (ARRRP) 5, 5, 2.5 and 1 g of gp140R2 were used in the first, second, third and fourth round of panning. a light chain-shuffling Fab library (3 107 members) was further constructed based on the heavy chain of R3H1. scFv gene fragment was digested with SfiI and cloned into pComb3X. to generate scFv protein, the scFv gene was PCR amplified. the new scFv products appended with SfiI and ApaI restriction sites were digested. Pseudotyped viruses were obtained after 48 h by centrifugation and filtration of cell culture through 0.45 m filters. for neutralization, viruses were mixed with different concentrations of antibodies for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. for neutralization, viruses were mixed with different concentrations of antibodies for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. candidate vaccine immunogens elicit potent neutralizers of early transmitted virus."}
