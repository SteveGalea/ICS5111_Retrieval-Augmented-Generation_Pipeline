{"summary": "chemokine receptor 2 (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) is a chemoattractant for monocytes, T cells, and other cells that express chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2) is a chemoattractant for monocytes, T cells, and other cells that express chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 2 (CCR2). in the central nervous system, CCL2-mediated leukocyte recruitment promotes tissue transgenic CCL2 expression in pancreatic islets in nonobese diabetic mice suppressed diabetes development. induced CCL2 expression in the CNS exacerbated the severity of ischemic brain injury. it diminished the severity of EAE by downregulating a TH1-associated gamma interferon (IFN-) response (4, 6, 18) mice infected with MHV-JHM develop acute and chronic infections of the CNS. infection with attenuated variants of MHV-JHM, J2.2-V-1, or its recombinant form rJ2.2 results in nonlethal acute and chronic encephalomyelitis. rJ2.2 is oligodendrocyte-tropic, and immune-mediated demyelination occurs during virus clearance. g mice developed exacerbated acute encephalomyelitis, with the majority succumbing to an otherwise nonlethal CNS infection. this resulted from a previously unappreciated ability of CCL2 to dysregulate the immune response. nontransgenic littermates and wild-type C57BL/6 mice were used as controls. anti-CD16/32 (2.4G2) were all from BD Pharmingen, anti-CD11b (M1/70), anti-Foxp3 (FJK-16S), anti-IFN- (XMG1.2), anti-TNF (MP6-XT22), anti-IL-2 (JES6-5H4), and anti-CD80 (16-10A1) were all from eBioscience. rJ2.2-infected cells were detected using mouse antibody specific to MHV nucleocapsid protein (monoclonal antibody 5B188.2, provided by M.

RESULTS Composition of cellular infiltrates in the brains of naive (uninfected) CCL2 Tg mice. b+ Ly6G were the most prominent population (55%) present in CCL2 Tg brains. transgenic CNS expression of CCL2 resulted in 600-fold (7.2 106 0.9 106 versus 1.2 104 0.4 104 cells) and 7.5-fold (1061.1 1 106 versus 1.4 105 0.5 105 cells) in the brain relative to non-Tg controls. frequency and absolute number of regulatory Foxp3+ CD4+ T cells (Tregs) were significantly increased in CCL2 Tg brains. these results indicate that constitutive expression resulted in a heterogeneous leukocyte infiltrate primarily rich in macrophages and microglia but also consisting of neutrophils. CD45+ CD11c+ CD11bhi and CD45+ CD11c+ CD11b/inter cells. ND, not determined (too few cells were detected in naive non-Tg brains for further analysis) the infection was uniformly nonlethal in the non-Tg controls. in contrast, the infection was uniformly nonlethal in the non-Tg controls. infected mice showed histological signs of severe immunopathology. virus titers were higher rather than diminished in CCL2 Tg brains. increased numbers of macrophages and microglia present in CCL2 Tg brains provided an additional reservoir for virus replication. rJ2.2 can infect macrophages and microglia. rJ2.2-infected CCL2 Tg mice show greater accumulation of brain-derived macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils than non-Tg controls. rJ2.2-infected CCL2 Tg mice show greater accumulation of brain-derived macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils. the data are from two to three separate experiments (n = 6 to 9 mice/group/time point) and are presented as the means the SEM. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001; ***, P 0.001. CCL2 Tg and non-Tg mice had similar frequencies (40%) and numbers of CD8+ T cells specific to the immunodominant S510 epitope. the frequencies and absolute numbers of IFN-producing M133-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were equivalent between the groups of mice. values for IFN-, TNF, and IL-2, which reflect protein levels, were equivalent between the groups of mice. differences in cytolytic function might contribute to delayed virus clearance in CCL2 Tg mice. the percentages of IFN--producing epitope-specific CD8+ (F) and CD4+ T cells (G) that coexpress TNF or IL-2 are shown in the left or right panels. the data are representative of three separate experiments (n = 8 to 10 mice/group/time point) brain-derived leukocytes were isolated from infected non-Tg and CCL2 Tg mice at days 5 and 7 p.i. and analyzed for frequencies (A) and total numbers (B) of CD4+ T cells expressing Foxp3. the data are representative of three separate experiments (n = 8 to 9 mice/group/time point) the data are representative of four individual experiments. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001. myeloid cells with suppressor function, including M2 macrophages, have been shown to impair effective immunity against certain intracellular infections and tumors. mRNA were equivalent between CCL2 Tg and control mice. naive and rJ2.2-infected mice showed augmented YM-1 expression. mRNA was extracted from brains of naive and infected non-Tg and CCL2 Tg mice at the indicated time points. photomicrographs were taken at original magnifications of 4 (E to H) and 10 (I and J) BMDM were treated in triplicate with CCL2 alone or IL-4 and IL-13, or in combination for 20 h. RNA was extracted from the cells and analyzed individually for Arg-1 and YM-1 expression by qRT-PCR. mRNA levels of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 were detected at similar low levels in brains of naive and non-Tg mice. RNA was extracted from brain-derived macrophages/microglia at day 5 p.i. microglia from naive non-Tg mice showed a bimodal distribution of DAF-FM-DA fluorescence, reflecting minimal NO production. macrophages and microglia in infected CCL2 Tg brains relative to non-Tg controls showed greater NO production on a per cell basis. macrophages and microglia with a mixed M1/M2 phenotype contributed to the dysregulated inflammatory milieu present in the brains of infected CCL2 Tg mice. the data are representative of two separate experiments (n = 3 to 4 mice/group/time point) and are shown as. histological analysis of naive (uninfected) CCL2 Tg mice revealed extensive meningeal and perivascular infiltrates. previous studies showed that Tg expression of CCL2 by oligodendrocytes induced leukocyte infiltration of perivascular spaces. but not the brain parenchyma. 1061.1 1 106 versus 1.4 105 0.5 105 cells increased in the brains of CCL2 Tg mice relative to non-Tg controls. two populations (CD45+ CD11c+ CD11b/int and CD45+ CD11c+ CD11bhi cells) of cells expressing CD11c were present in high numbers in CCL2 Tg brains. ukocytes infiltrate primarily rich in macrophages and microglia. ukocytes consisting of neutrophils, DCs, and CD8+ and CD4+ cells. naive and rJ2.2-infected CCL2 Tg mice infected. ND, not determined (too few cells were detected in naive non-Tg brains for further analysis) the data are from two independent experiments and presented as the means the SEM (n = 3 to 6 mice per group) infected non-Tg (n = 6) and CCL2 Tg mice (n = 11) were weighed daily (A) and monitored for survival (B) the data are presented as the means the SEM. a dotted line indicates the limit of virus detection of the plaque assay. rJ2.2 can infect macrophages and microglia. the increased numbers of macrophage and microglia present in CCL2 Tg brains provided an additional reservoir for virus replication. rJ2.2 has a strong tropism for oligodendrocytes. g mice show greater accumulation of brain-derived macrophages, microglia, and neutrophils than non-Tg controls. we isolated mononuclear cells from infected brains and analyzed them. the absolute numbers of CD45+ cells did not increase appreciably in the brains of CCL2 Tg mice upon infection. the data are from two to three separate experiments (n = 6 to 9 mice/group/time point) and are presented as the means the SEM. numbers of CD11c+ CD11b/int cells were 7-fold greater at day 5 p.i. in the CCL2 Tg brains relative to non-Tg controls but were similar in magnitude between the two groups at day 7 p.i. CCL2 Tg and non-Tg mice had similar frequencies (40%) and numbers of CD8+ T cells specific to the immunodominant S510 epitope. we also measured the magnitude and functionality of the MHV-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response by stimulating brain-derived leukocytes directly ex vivo. CD107a/b levels on CD8+ T cells after S510 peptide stimulation were similar when CCL2 Tg and control mice were compared. T cell effector function is not impaired in the brains of rJ2.2-infected CCL2 Tg mice. brain-derived leukocytes were isolated from non-Tg and CCL2 Tg mice at days 5 and 7 p.i. Tregs are present in both greater frequency and greater number in virus-infected CCL2 Tg brains. impaired effector T cell function seemed unlikely to explain delayed virus clearance and numbers of Foxp3+ Tregs were elevated. macrophages from CCL2 Tg mice display reduced surface levels of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II) and costimulatory molecules. phenotypic activation/maturation of brain-derived macrophages and microglia. myeloid cells with suppressor function have been shown to impair effective immunity against certain intracellular infections and tumors. genes associated with AAM, such as arginase-1 (Arg-1), YM-1, and resistin-like molecule alpha (Relm/Fizz-1) (40), were upregulated in infected brain tissue using qRT-PCR. RNA was extracted from brains of naive and infected non-Tg and CCL2 Tg mice at the indicated time points. levels of YM-1, Arg-1, and Fizz-1 mRNA were measured by qRT-PCR. the data are from two separate experiments (n = 6 mice/group/time point) the data are from one of two separate experiments and are shown as the means the SEM. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01; **, P 0.001. mRNA levels of two genes associated with classically activated macrophages were similar in CCL2 Tg and non-Tg mice. mRNA levels of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-10 were detected at low levels in brains of naive and rJ2.2-infected mice. RNA was extracted from brains of naive or infected non-Tg and CCL2 Tg mice at the indicated time points. ns, not significant; *, P 0.05. microglia from naive non-Tg mice showed a bimodal distribution of DAF-FM-DA fluorescence, indicating some cells produced elevated levels of NO even in the absence of infection. microglia from naive non-Tg mice showed a bimodal distribution of DAF-FM-DA fluorescence, reflecting minimal NO production. brain-derived leukocytes were isolated from naive or infected non-Tg and CCL2 Tg mice. we selected the positive gate based on microglia exhibiting high levels of DAF-FM-DA fluorescence (naive CCL2 Tg mice, dashed line) a dysregulated immune response developed in these mice, resulting in ineffective virus clearance and significant mortality. previous studies using CCL2 or CCR2 null mice revealed that during MHV infection CCL2 and CCR2 promoted the recruitment and influx of macrophages and T cells into parenchymal tissue to facilitate virus clearance (20, 21) subsets of monocytes and Tregs express CCR2 under baseline conditions. some of the first cells entering the MHV-infected CNS of wild-type mice are Tregs. however, their numbers are quickly overwhelmed by the virus-specific T effector cell response, resulting in efficient virus clearance. mice infected with rJ2.2 largely functioned in draining lymph nodes. Tregs, including virus-specific Tregs, are also detected in the brain and spinal cord. augmented numbers of these cells in brains of CCL2 Tg mice likely contribute to delayed virus clearance. macrophages/microglia from CCL2 Tg brains expressed elevated levels of YM-1. YM-1 is a secreted lectin expressed by macrophages but lacks chitinase activity. overexpression of YM-1 by macrophages has been associated with progressive crystalline pneumonia in mice."}
