{"summary": "studies of pneumonia frequently report low levels of pathogen identification. improved knowledge of pneumonia aetiology is essential for development of targeted management and effective public health strategies such as vaccination. cohort of 2001\u20132002 study was a proportion of children with pneumonia seen at these recruitment sites as part of a previously published regional epidemiological survey [11]. they consented and were enrolled in the aetiological study. ions and auscultatory findings included crackles, bronchial breathing or reduced breath sounds. exclusion criteria included residing outside north east England. bronchiolitis, hospitalisation in the preceding 3 weeks or normal chest radiograph after formal reporting by a radiologist. the nature of the collected samples were standardised across all ages. recovery of bacterial pathogens from nasopharyngeal secretions, sputum or by urinary pneumococcal antigen was not considered evidence of definite infection. however, only positive results that were classified as likely causative pathogens of pneumonia according to defined diagnostic criteria are presented and discussed. tests were performed in the microbiology laboratory, Newcastle upon Tyne Hospitals NHS Trust and the health protection agency. samples from Middlesbrough were transported to Newcastle upon Tyne via daily transport services. antistreptolysin O titre was assayed in both studies using a Rheumajet ASO kit. Detection rates of pathogens are categorised as proportions of those tested. children in the 5 years age group should have been vaccinated with PCV. cohort of 2001\u20132002 study was a proportion of children with pneumonia seen at these recruitment sites as part of a previously published regional epidemiological survey [11] they consented and were enrolled in the aetiological study with an extended panel of investigations. all chest radiographs were reviewed by second consultant radiologists. radiological findings were categorised into lobar, patchy or perihilar. valency of PCV was obtained from parents. any positive results from the potentially colonised above-mentioned sites were added together separately. rates were grouped among \u201cunknown causes\u201d in figure 1 for the reader\u2019s information. samples from Middlesbrough were transported to Newcastle upon Tyne via daily transport services. pneumococcal isolates from blood and respiratory secretions were serotype-specific Streptococcus pneumoniae antigens. antistreptolysin O titre was assayed in both studies using a Rheumajet ASO kit. Detection rates of pathogens are expressed as proportions of those tested. age group classification was under or above 5 years, as by the start of post-vaccine study. figure 1 summarises the aetiological and radiological classifications and table 2 lists the results of the diagnostic tests performed. a likely causative pathogen was established in 61% of children post-vaccination, compared to 48.5% pre-vaccination. 41 children were not eligible for the PCV due to age criteria. its uptake was 94% (112 out of 119) among eligible children. 83 received age-appropriate doses (57 had full schedule) post-vaccination, acute viral serological assays were only positive in seven patients with influenza A virus infection. post-vaccination, acute viral serological assays were only positive in seven patients with influenza A virus infection. pre-vaccination, combined acute and convalescent serology identified eight patients with RSV infection, eight patients with adenovirus and one with Epstein\u2013Barr virus. adenovirus 11 2 13/213 (6.0) 7 4 11/149 (7.4) Adenovirus 11 2 13/213 (6.0) 10 0 10/145 (6.9) Parainfluenza 1\u20134 5 0 5/158 (3.2) 5 1 6/141 (4.3) Coronavirus (type OC43) not tested 2 1 3/121 (2.5) Total 103 44 147 100 42 142 Data are presented as n, unless otherwise stated. hMPV was not detected in any of the 48 pre-vaccination respiratory samples tested, but was identified in one child in the post-vaccine study. hMPV was not detected in any of the 48 pre-vaccination respiratory samples tested. the rate of detected mycoplasma infection was higher pre-vaccination (12.5%) when paired acute and convalescent samples were available, with 7% (nine out of 128) in those aged 5 years and 27% (13 out of 48) in those aged >5 years. study 2009\u20132011 study 5 years 5\u201316 years n/N (%) 5 years 5\u201316 years n/N (%) Bacterial Streptococcus pneumoniae 28 7 35/238 (14.7) 14 10 24/138 (17.4) Mycoplasma pneumoniae 9 13 22/176 (12.5) 2 6 8/81 (9.9) Group A Streptococcus 5 9 14/202 (7.0) 6 8 14/133 (10.5) Staphylococcus aureus 3 n represents the total number of performed tests with positive results classified as definite/probable infections. 71 (50%) viruses were detected among those aged 5 years. hMPV was not detected in any of the 48 pre-vaccination respiratory samples tested. a serotype was identified in 75% (18 out of 24) in the post-vaccine study. the rate of positive blood culture post-vaccination was almost double (5.6%) that pre-vaccination (3.2%) compared to 16.7% (13 out of 78) during the first year of PCV13 vaccination. rates of infections were 22.4% bacterial, 22.4% viral and 10.5% mixed. there was no difference between the rates of viral infection before and after the introduction of PCV13. pneumococcal pneumolysin DNA can also be detected in non-pneumococcal streptococci. the pneumolysin gene can also be detected in non-pneumococcal Viridans-group streptococci, particularly S. pseudopneumoniae and S. mitis. pneumococcal serotyping was possible, with the majority being identified from pleural fluids. all serotypes recovered were non-PCV7 but included in PCV13. despite lack of comprehensive serotype data, this suggests PCV13 could substantially reduce invasive pneumococcal disease. viral screening was expanded to include eight viruses with subgroups. bocavirus, coronavirus and hMPV highlight the minimal contribution of these viruses to the aetiology of pneumonia in children in the UK. lack of serotype data of the identified pneumococci from the pre-vaccine study limits the true comparison with the serotype profile after the conjugate vaccine. the difference between the two studies in the diagnostic methods used and the pathogens investigated."}
