{"summary": "Background Coronavirus membrane (M) proteins are capable of interacting with nucleocapsid (N), spike (S), membrane (M) and envelope (E) proteins. Whether E can release from cells or E/N interaction exists to contribute to enhanced VLP production is unknown. coronavirus E is a small integral membrane protein consisting of approximately 76 to 109 amino acids and containing a hydrophobic domain. two or three cysteine residues are located on the carboxyl side of the hydrophobic domain in coronavirus E proteins. MHV and IBV E proteins are capable of release from cells as vesicles [5,24] implying a relationship between E release and its contribution to virus production. results indicate no correlation between SARS-CoV E capacity to release or interact with N, or its ability to promote VLP production. cloned PCR product digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech) the resultant construct was then digested with BamHI and Not1. the resultant construct was fused to carboxyl terminus of GST. cells were transfected with 20 g of plasmid DNA. for each construct, cells were transfected with 20 g of plasmid DNA. unless otherwise indicated, 10 g of each plasmid was used for co-transfection. -cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), collected in IPB plus 0.1 mM PMSF, microcentrifuged at 4\u00b0C for 15 min at 13,700 x g. supernatant and cell samples were mixed with equal volumes of 2X sample buffer (12.5 mM Tris\u2013HCl [pH 6.8], 2% SDS, 20% glycerol, 0.25% bromphenol blue) and 5% -mer samples were incubated with the primary antibody for 1 h. primary antibody concentrations were anti-HA at a dilution of 1:500. rabbit anti-mouse rhodamine-conjugated antibody at a 1:100 dilution served as the secondary antibody. all reactions took place at 4\u00b0C overnight on a rocking mixer. immunoprecipitate-associated resin or bead-bound complexes were pelleted, washed tree times with lysis buffer, two times with PBS, eluted with 1X sample buffer, and subjected to SDS-10% PAGE as described above. cloned PCR product digested with BamHI and SalI and ligated into pDsRed-Monomer-N1 (Clonetech) the cloned N-DsRed was digested with NheI and BamHI and ligated into pEGFP-N1 (Clonetech), yielding construct N-EGFP. GST-M was constructed by fusing SARS-CoV N coding sequences to culture supernatant and cells were harvested for protein analysis 2\u20133 d post-transfection. supernatant from transfected cells was collected, filtered, and centrifuged through 2 ml of 20% sucrose in TSE. cells were rinsed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. membrane-bound M, M-FLAG, HA-E, E-FLAG or GST proteins were immunodetected using a rabbit anitserum, anti-HA, anti-FLAG or anti-GST(Sigma) monoclonal antibody at a dilution of 1:5,000. primary antibody concentrations were anti-HA at a dilution of 1:500. supernatants from transfected 293 T cells were collected, filtered, and centrifuged through 2 ml sucrose cushions. iodixanol density gradient fractionation Supernatants from transfected 293 T cells were collected, filtered, and centrifuged through 2 ml sucrose cushions. a FLAG tagged at the SARS-CoV M carboxyl terminus (M-FLAG) significantly inhibits N packaging into VLPs. we co-expressed N with M-FLAG in the absence or presence of SARS-CoV E tagged with either HA at the amino terminus (HA-E) or with FLAG at the carboxyl terminus (E-FLAG) pBlueScript SK added to maintain a plasmid DNA level of 20 g. supernatants and cells were collected and prepared for protein analysis. SARS-CoV N and E were detected with a mouse anti-N, anti-HA, or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. 293 T cells were co-transfected with E tagged with either a FLAG or HA and N, M or S expression vectors. culture supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection and subjected to Western immunoblotting. HA-E or N was co-expressed with GST tagged at the N amino terminus. E or N association with GST-N was assessed using a GST pull-down assay. RNase treatment significantly reduced levels of co-pulled-down N. 293 T cells were co-transfected with SARS-CoV HA-E and indicated GST-N fusion construct. cells and supernatants were collected at 48 h post-transfection, prepared, and subjected to Western immunoblot analysis. each GST fusion construct was transiently co-expressed with E. substitution mutations for cysteines-the palmitoylation targets in MHV E can reduce virus yields, implying their importance for MHV virus production [14,17]. EC3A denotes alanine replacement of all three cysteine residues at E (C40, C43 and C44) EC3A produced VLPs as efficiently as wt when co-expressed with both M and N. this suggests that SARS-CoV E cysteines are not involved in E release, E/N interactions, or VLP assembly. ileucine motif 74-LL-75 replaced with alanines. a positive correlation exists between release levels of co-expressed N and E74LL/AA. 74-LL-75 was not functionally involved in E release, E/N interaction, or promotion of VLP production. 74LL/AA indicates alanine substitutions for two leucine residues at the E carboxyl tail (74-LL-75) 76V denotes a deletion of the last carboxyl-terminal residue V76 from E. supernatant and cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. 76V mutants largely localized in the Golgi area. a fraction of N co-localized with E76V in the perinuclear area. this staining pattern was barely distinguishable from that of cells co-expressing HA-E and N-EGFP. this implies that even though E76V may associate with N to a certain extent, the association is insufficient for enabling E76V co-precipitation with GST-N. a FLAG tagged at the SARS-CoV M carboxyl terminus significantly inhibits N packaging into VLPs. we co-expressed N with M-FLAG in the absence or presence of SARS-CoV E tagged with either HA at the amino terminus (HA-E) or with FLAG at the carboxyl terminus (E-FLAG) N that was barely detectable in medium became readily detected following co-expression with HA-E. SARS-CoV N and E were detected with a mouse anti-N, anti-HA, or anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. as expected, N was readily detected when co-expressed with HA-E or with M, but barely detectable in medium when expressed alone or co-expressed with S. 293 T cells were co-transfected with E tagged with either a FLAG or HA and N, M or S expression vectors. culture supernatants were collected 48 h post-transfection and subjected to Western immunoblotting. HA-E or N was co-expressed with GST tagged at the N amino terminus. GST by itself was not capable of pulling down HA-E or N. the same RNase condition did not reduce the amount of co-pulled-down HA-E. 293 T cells were co-transfected with SARS-CoV HA-E and indicated GST-N fusion construct. cells and supernatants were collected at 48 h post-transfection, prepared, and subjected to Western immunoblot analysis. a set of GST-N fusions containing multiple N coding sequences fused to the GST carboxyl terminus were analyzed. substitution mutations for cysteines-the palmitoylation targets in MHV E can reduce virus yields, implying their importance for MHV virus production [14,17]. EC3A denotes alanine replacement of all three cysteine residues at E (C40, C43 and C44) EC3A produced VLPs as efficiently as wt when co-expressed with both M and N. this suggests that SARS-CoV E cysteines are not involved in the E release process. a positive correlation exists between release levels of co-expressed N and E74LL/AA. 74-LL-75 was not functionally involved in E release, E/N interaction, or the promotion of VLP production. a possible explanation is steric hindrance during VLP assembly. 74LL/AA indicates alanine substitutions for two leucine residues at the E carboxyl tail. 76V denotes a deletion of the last carboxyl-terminal residue V76 from E. supernatant and cells were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. when co-expressed with EGFP-tagged N, a fraction of N co-localized with E76V. this staining pattern was barely distinguishable from that of cells co-expressing HA-E and N-EGFP. this implies that even though E76V may associate with N to a certain extent, the association is insufficient for enabling E76V co-precipitation with GST-N. iodixanol density gradient fractionation analyses suggest that released E vesicles and E-N VLPs exhibit slightly higher densities compared to those of M-E-N VLPs. this suggests that N is incapable of associating with S, and supports the idea of specific E/N interaction. blocking MHV E palmitoylation results in significantly impaired VLP assembly. this suggests that EC3A is not required for SARS-CoV E protein release or VLP assembly. despite a higher release level compared to wt E, EC3A is released more efficiently than wt E in medium. mutants exhibit 100- to 1,000-fold reductions in virus yields. the contribution of SARS-CoV E to efficient VLP production is also independent of its release capacity."}
