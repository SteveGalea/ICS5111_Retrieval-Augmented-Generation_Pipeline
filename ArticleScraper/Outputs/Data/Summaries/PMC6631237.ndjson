{"summary": "the avian leukosis virus subgroup J (ALV-J) is a member of the a-retrovirus genus of retroviridae, causing tumor disease, immunosuppression, and other secondary diseases in chicken. the prevention and control of ALV-J is mainly through eliminating infected chickens due to lacking effective vaccines and drugs. chicken cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (chCH25H) inhibited viral entry by production of 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC) previously, it has been reported that CH25H broadly inhibited viral entry by production of 25-Hydroxycholesterol (25HC) 25HC also acts as an amplifier of inflammation via AP-1. chicken PBMC were Treated with ALV-J and IFN- PBMC were treated with chicken IFN- (chIFN-) for 6 h. PBMCs could respond to IFN [12], and chicken PBMCs could be infected with ALV-J [13] s were filtered by removing adapter-containing reads, low-quality bases and low-quality reads with more than 50% of low quality bases (Q-value 20) the remaining reads were mapped to the chicken genome assembly (Gallus_gallus-5.0) using topHat2. chCH25H was selected to further explore its anti-ALV-J function and mechanism in DF1 cells. DF1 cells were treated with chIFN- (1000 U/mL) and ALV-J (104 TCID50/0.1 mL) after 24 h and 48 h, chCH25H expression was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. the first nucleotide before the chCH25H coding region is numbered 1. the different dual luciferase reporter vectors are named PGL3- p2077(2077/1), p1000 (1000/1), p500 (500/1), p250 (250/1), p125 (125/1) and p75 (75/1), respectively. DF1 cells were transfected with chCH25H plasmid by lipofectamine 3000 reagent. at 24 h post-transfection, transfected DF1 cells were infected with ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06. RNA, cell supernatants and total protein samples were collected at 24 and 48 hpi to detect replication of ALV-J. the expression of chCH25H in chCH25H knockout cell line was detected by qPCR. these chCH25H knockout cells were infected with SCAU-HN06 strain. cell supernatants collected from DF1 cells transfected with empty vector were uesed as control. the methods of ALV-J infection are the same as the related experiments of 25HC. Western Blot Analysis Western blotting was performed with mouse anti-flag monoclonal antibody JE9. results were visualized and analyzed with an Odyssey FC infrared imaging system. results are presented as means SEM. chicken PBMC Were Treated with ALV-J and IFN- PBMC were treated with chicken IFN- (chIFN-) for 6 h. total RNA for RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was isolated from these samples. mRNA was enriched by Oligo(dT beads. electrophoresis, PCR amplified, and sequenced using Illumina HiSeqTM 2500 by Gene Denovo Biotechnology Co. (Guangzhou, China) the raw reads were filtered by removing the adapter-containing reads, low-quality bases including reads with more than 10% unknown nucleotides and low-quality reads with more than 50% of low quality bases (Q-value 20). chCH25H was selected to further explore its anti-ALV-J function and mechanism in DF1 cells. DF1 cells were treated with chIFN- (1000 U/mL) and ALV-J (104 TCID50/0.1 mL) chCH25H expression was measured by real-time quantitative PCR. pig (XM_005671263.3), duck (XM_005029425.3), monkey (NM_001198699.1), and chicken (NM_001277354.1) were truncated into 6 segments to construct different dual luciferase reporter vectors. the first nucleotide before the chCH25H coding region is numbered 1. feron stimulated response elements (ISRE) consensus 5\u2019 A/GGTTTCN(1\u20132)TTTCC/T3\u2019 or its reverse complement, and the common gamma activated sequence (GAS) consensus 5\u2019 TTNCNNNAA3\u2019 were screened at upstream of chCH25H according to previous studies [23]. overexpression of chCH25H and Measurement of ALV-J Replication in DF-1cells. DF1 cells were transfected with the Cas9/gRNA recombinant plasmid of chCH25H. DF1 cells were screened with 2.5 g/mL puromycin in DMEM. total DNA was extracted from these cells and was used as template. qPCR and ELISA were used to determine the effect of 25HC on ALV-J replication at 24 hpi and 48 hpi. same treatment is repeated in chCH25H knockout DF1 cell line. ELISA for chicken IFN-, IFN- and IFN- determination were obtained from Shanghai Enzyme-Linked Biotechnology Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China) the experiments were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s specifications. compared to untreated PBMC, DEGs were identified from ALV-J-infected group and IFN--treated group by RNA-Seq. the intersection of chicken type I ISGs and up-regulated expression DEGs induced by ALV-J were considered as potential anti-ALV-J ISG candidates. -regulated DEGs were identical in ALV-J-infected PBMC and IFN-treated PBMC. 23 DEGs were up-regulated in IFN--treated PBMC cells. expression of chCH25H is upregulated by ALV-J infection and IFN- treatment in DF1 cells. qPCR showed that chCH25H is induced by both chIFN- treatment and ALV-J infection in DF1 cells at 24 hpi and 48 hpi. results showed that chCH25H of each species were located on different chromosomes, and only the chCH25H located on chromosome 6. bp in presumed promoter region all significantly increased the relative luciferase activity compared to the empty pGL3-basic vector in DF1 cells. these results indicated that the core promoter region of chicken CH25H was located within 75/1 sequence. the upstream regions of chCH25H analysis showed that 7 GAS located in these regions. qPCR, ELISA, and western blot all demonstrated that overexpression of chCH25H could inhibit expression of ALV-J p27 and envelope protein in DF1 cells at 48 hpi. results indicated that chicken CH25H significantly inhibited ALV-J replication. knockout efficiency of the chCH25H-knockout cell line was 95%. knockdown of endogenous chCH25H could significantly enhance ALV-J replication. qPCR results showed that knockdown of endogenous chCH25H could significantly enhance ALV-J replication. chCH25H produces a soluble antiviral factor in DF1 cells. DF1 cells were pretreated with the cell supernatants collected from DF1 cells overexpressing chCH25H. no chIFN including IFN-, IFN- and IFN- were significantly induced by overexpressing chCH25H. the treatment of DF1 cells with different concentrations of 25HC for 24 h showed that 1 M of 25HC is the highest concentration that is not toxic to cells. 25HC, a product of chCH25H, inhibits ALV-J replication in DF1 cells. DF1 cells and chCH25H-knockout DF1 cells pretreated with ethanol were used as control (NC) the expression of ALV-J gp85 mRNA and p27 protein was detected by qPCR (E and ELISA) at 24 and 48 hpi. 152 up-regulated DEGs were identical in ALV-J-infected PBMC and IFN-treated PBMC. 23 DEGs were up-regulated in IFN-treated PBMC cells but down-regulated in ALV-J-infected PBMC. expression of chCH25H is upregulated by ALV-J infection and IFN- treatment in DF1 cells. DF1 cells were infected with ALV-J strain SCAU-HN06. chCH25H expression was significantly increased at 24 and 48 hpi. chCH25H located on chicken chromosome 6. all of the CH25H locus in compared species is flanked with LIPA gene. bp, 500 bp, 1000 bp and 2077 bp in presumed promoter region all significantly increased relative luciferase activity compared to the empty pGL3-basic vector in DF1 cells. overexpression of chCH25H could inhibit expression of ALV-J p27 and envelope protein in DF1 cells at 48 hpi. qPCR results showed that knockdown of endogenous chCH25H could significantly enhance ALV-J replication. chCH25H expression in chCH25H knockout cells was significantly decreased. chCH25H produces a soluble antiviral factor in DF1 cells. chCH25H produces a soluble anti-ALV-J factor that is not chicken type I and II IFN. no chIFN including IFN-, IFN- and IFN- were significantly induced by overexpressing chCH25H. 25HC, the product of chCH25H, has anti-ALV-J activity. the treatment of DF1 cells with different concentrations of 25HC for 24 h showed that 1 M of 25HC is the highest concentration that is not toxic to cells. DF1 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate and treated with ethanol. different concentrations of 25HC (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8 M) for 24 h. expression of ALV-J gp85 mRNA and p27 protein detected by qPCR. more than 100 chicken ISGs have been identified by microarray and RNA-seq in primary chicken embryo fibroblast (CEF) there are still many chicken ISGs that need to be identified. in this study, 897 genes significantly up-regulated by chIFN- in chicken PBMC were considered to be chicken type I ISGs. chCH25H is a conserved ISG in mammals, but lacks enough description in the chicken. chIFN- and ALV-J induced expression of chCH25H in chicken PBMC and DF1 cells. chCH25H is an interferon-stimulated gene in chicken. chCH25H can be used as a new strategy to control ALV-J. 25HC could be used as an anti-ALV-J therapeutic as it has in vitro activity against ALV-J."}
