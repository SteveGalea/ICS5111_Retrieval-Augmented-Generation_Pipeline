{"summary": "the first outbreak of C. auris infection involving 12 patients was reported from India between 2009 and 2012 [16], followed by the first in Europe involving 50 patients in London, between April 2015 and July 2016 [17]. in the united states, the first seven cases of C. auris occurred between May 2013 and January 2016 reported retrospectively [19]. we describe the first nosocomial outbreak of C. auris with genetically related environmental and clinical isolates in Sohar city, Oman. the outbreak occurred in a secondary care regional (363-bed) hospital with different medical and surgical units. the intensive care unit (ICU) is an open multi-bed space that can accommodate up to 6 ventilated patients (medical and surgical cases), and the coronary care unit (CCU) first set of environmental samples were collected on 9 October 2018, just before conducting cleaning using a chlorine-based disinfectant. another set of swabs were collected after cleaning and decontamination of the ICU on 16 October 2018. a total of 140 environmental swabs were collected for screening purposes. DNA extraction was performed by the Quick CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) extraction method. a total of 10 L Proteinase K were added and mixed on a moBio vortex. extracted DNAs were stored at 20 \u00b0C until use. PCR was performed in an ABI PRISM 2720 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) amplifications were performed as follows: 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles consisting of 94 \u00b0C for 45 s, 52 \u00b0C for 45 s and 72 \u00b0C for 2 min. the ML trees were constructed with MEGA v. 6.2. maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was done with RAxML-VI-HPC v. 7.0.3. DNA was extracted and purified with the MagNA Pure LC instrument. the outbreak occurred in a secondary care regional (363-bed) hospital in Oman (Sohar Hospital) with different medical and surgical units. the intensive care unit (ICU) is an open multi-bed space that can accommodate up to 6 ventilated patients (medical and surgical cases), and the coronary care unit (CCU), which has capacity for 8 patients in single rooms. first set of environmental samples were collected on 9 October 2018, just before conducting cleaning using a chlorine-based disinfectant. a total of 140 environmental swabs were collected for screening purposes. hand swabs were also collected from 35 health care workers in intensive care and high dependency areas. DNA extraction was performed by the Quick CTAB (cetyltrimethylammonium bromide) extraction method. a total of 10 L Proteinase K were added and mixed on a moBio vortex. extracted DNAs were stored at 20 \u00b0C until use. PCR reactions mixture contained 1 L template DNA (50 ng), 1.25 L 10 PCR buffer, 1 L dNTP mix, 0.5 L of each primer (10 pmol), 0.2 L Taq polymerase (Biotaq, Bioline, Germany) (5 U/L), BSA 0.5 L, and water to complete the final volume of 12.5 L. PCR products were visualized by electrophoresis on a 1% (w/v) agarose gel. maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was done with RAxML-VI-HPC v. 7.0.3 with non-parametric bootstrapping using 1000 replicates. DNA was extracted and purified with the MagNA Pure LC instrument and the MagNA Pure DNA isolation kit III. a total of 32 patients were identified (25 infected and 7 colonized) with C. auris from April 2018 to April 2019. the affected age group ranged from 14\u201388 years with a median of 64 years. antibacterial usage prior to diagnosis was reported for 16 (50%) patients. 20 (63%) patients had been admitted to the ICU prior to diagnosis. 11 (34.4%) were in other medical or surgical wards. out of 32 infected patients 17 died (53.1%), 12 (37.5%) recovered, and 3 (9.3%) were still admitted. 32 cases of C. auris were found to be positive after removing duplicates from the same patient. seven patients recovered from more than one site during their stay in the hospital. isolates from Oman clustered with Indian isolates in the south-Asia clade 1. isolates from south africa, Japan/Korea, Venezuela, and Iran each clustered in the other four major C. auris clades.

Elective admissions to the hospital were postponed, restricting visitors to isolated patients. ITS gene possessed enough polymorphisms and was an excellent marker with 99%\u2013100% accuracy for the identification of Candida species to be C. auris. the reported clinical isolates were C. auris and were found to be identical to many other clinical strains of C. auris from all over the world. the highest non-susceptible MICs were recorded for fluconazole (MIC50,90 > 64 mg/L) and amphotericin B (MIC90 2 mg/L) the highest non-susceptible MICs were recorded for fluconazole (MIC50,90 > 64 mg/L) and amphotericin B (MIC90 2 mg/L) auris C. auris 2.22 1 8 0.016 0.063 0.031 0.063 CHL 2830 (C) auris C. auris 2.28 2 >64 0.25 0.5 0.063 0.125 0.016 0.063 0.063 CHL 2982 (C) auris C. auris 2.39 1 8 0.016 0.063 0.16 0.016 0.063 0.063 CHL 3182 (C) auris among the health care workers; training all involved units on standard and contact isolation precautions; involving an administration and infection control committee. implementing screening for C. auris on routine admission to the ICU and all contacts of positive cases; and ensuring proper terminal cleaning of rooms and bed spaces. the 30-day crude mortality rates with C. auris infection have been variable in different geographical regions. in the united kingdom no deaths were directly attributable to C. auris infection. the high crude mortality maybe a reflection of the comorbidities within the infected population. Candida auris can persist on different types of surfaces, including moist, dry, and plastic surfaces. the success of environmental decontamination was variable in the literature. the same protocol without UV light was used in our setting twice. this failed to have impact on the incidence of new C. auris cases. high mortality rates, challenging environmental decontamination, and high levels of antifungal resistance have highlighted the importance of rapid containment of the spread of this public health pathogen. auris has developed rapid and accurate diagnostic tools at the point of care [20,44] and investing in infection control and antimicrobial stewardship programs."}
