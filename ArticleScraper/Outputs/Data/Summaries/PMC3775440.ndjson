{"summary": "mAb-based immunotherapy is becoming important in infectious diseases because of widespread resistance to drugs among pathogens, immunocompromised hosts, and theemergence of new pathogens. passive immunotherapy could be used to provide protection in the periods of high-exposure risk. chimeric antibody has been successfully produced and tested for specific binding activity in many previous studies. a human-mouse chimeric antibody generated from mAb against hepatitis E virus (HEV) capsid proteins E2 still maintains binding activity similar to the original mAb. different primer sets have been developed for amplifying the variable domains. different primer sets have been developed for amplifying the variable domains. the one from Novagen is also commercially available. mAb 1A9 is an antibody generated in mice against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike protein. both the mouse 1A9 and chimeric 1A9 are able to bind to spike protein in HEK 293-FT cell lysates. extract RNA from hybridoma cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) Suspend cells in 350 L lysis buffer by vortexing and pass through QIAshredder spin column for RNA extraction. 10 white or light blue colonies in LB broth containing 100 g mL1 ampicillin for up to 16 hours at 37\u00b0C. keep bacteria in LB broth at 4\u00b0C for short-term storage. pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk plasmids and PCR-amplified V L separately using the same FastDigest restriction enzymes (e.g., EcoRI and BsiWI for V L, Note 5) pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 with V H on LB agar plates containing 25 g mL1 zeocin and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk with V L on LB agar plates containing 50 g mL1 blasticidin S HCl overnight at 37\u00b0C. ulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) add 2 g of each recombinant plasmid (pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 with V H and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk with V L) and 12 L Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) to separate tubes containing 100 L Opti-Mem (Invitrogen) extract RNA from hybridoma cells using RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN) Suspend cells in 350 L lysis buffer by vortexing and pass through QIAshredder spin column. ligated products into competent TOP10 cells by heat shock method. add transformed bacteria onto LB agar plates containing 100 g mL1 ampicillin (Sigma) and 40 L X-gal solution. grow bacteria from at least 10 white or light blue colonies in LB broth. pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 and PCR-amplified V H separately using the same FastDigest restriction enzymes (e.g., EcoRI and BsiWI for V L, Note 5) it is important to ensure no frameshifting after the V H or V L is ligated into pFUSE vectors. Clone V H into pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 and V L into pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk. transform plasmid after ligation step into DH5- competent cells by heat shock method. antibody expression and Purification Seed 1.5 million of human Embryonic Kidney 293-FT cells (HEK 293-FT) in 6 cm dish. add 2 g of each recombinant plasmid (pFUSEss-CHIg-hG1 with V H and pFUSE2ss-CLIg-hk with V L) 3\u20135 eluted fractions with the highest protein concentration on 12% SDS-PAGE and stain gel with coomassie blue dye to visualise Ig heavy and light chains. decrease the annealing temperate by steps of two degrees if many non-specific PCR products are found. ss-CLIg-hk in the 5\u2032 to 3\u2032 direction, including EcoRI, AgeI, BstEII, NcoI, and BsiWI. hek 293-FT cells should be around 80\u201390% confluent for optimal transfection."}
