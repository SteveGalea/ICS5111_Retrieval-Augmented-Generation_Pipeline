{"summary": "in 2007 australia experienced its first outbreak of highly infectious equine influenza. government disease control measures were put in place to control, contain, and eradicate the disease. these measures included movement restrictions and quarantining of properties. the study is the first to collect psychological distress data from an affected population during such a disease outbreak. it has potential to inform those involved in assessing the potential psychological impacts of human infectious diseases such as pandemic influenza. the windborne virus can be spread for distances up to eight kilometres. high levels of movement control and monitoring were maintained throughout outbreak. infected areas were quarantined, and high levels of disease monitoring were maintained. the disease outbreak peaked in late September/early October 2007. a range of government financial support and assistance was available to those affected within a short time of outbreak onset. the current study was conducted to gain additional complementary data to assess the impacts of EI on the social and emotional health and well-being of those affected. the full study covered many other aspects, such as adherence to biosecurity requirements, effects of social isolation due to quarantine and the consequences of restricted horse movement and related activities. in the uk higher 'caseness' as indicated by the GHQ(G) was found in farmers from 'badly infected' areas, although higher psychological morbidity generally was reported in farmers from both badly infected and unaffected areas. in a study of Dutch dairy farmers around half of those whose animals were culled suffered from severe post-traumatic distress, with this reducing to one in five for those where severe restrictions were imposed. recognizing the mental health aspects of the animal-human bond is an important factor in public health approaches to disaster. it follows that in an animal-centred disease outbreak, such as EI affecting horses, the potential disruption of the animal-human bond could have significant implications for the mental health and resilience of those affected. distress of 5% reported in one study [25] and 13.4\u201313.8% for combined 'high'/'very high' psychological distress in another [26]. findings are of relevance in the current study as it would be expected that horse-ownership would be linked to rural and peri-urban residency. high levels of movement control and restriction were maintained throughout outbreak. infected areas were quarantined, and high levels of disease monitoring were maintained. study was conducted to gain additional complementary complementary data to assess the impacts of EI on social and emotional health and well-being of those affected. the full study covered many other aspects, such as adherence to biosecurity requirements, effects of social isolation due to quarantine and restricted horse movement and related activities. there does not appear to be any published studies of the human response or impacts to EI or the containment strategies used to control this disease. around half of those whose animals were culled suffered from post-traumatic distress. higher levels of symptoms were reported for older respondents and those with lower levels of education. differences in stress, psychological marginalization, and depression were reported for different disease control areas. affecting horses, the potential disruption of the animal-human bond, and the impact of policies restricting animal-human activities could have significant implications for the mental health and resilience of those affected. the main outcome measure in this study is non-specific psychological distress, as measured by the Kessler 10 (K10) [14]. the K10 was selected because it is a well-established and validated measure that is used widely in population research in Australia. 8,000 addressees registered on the HECD; most were individuals, but also included industry associations, pony clubs, and horse groups that would forward information to their own memberships nationally. a small group of public health professionals in NSW Health had been involved in aiding the NSW DPI in disease control management. the main outcome measure reported in this paper is non-specific psychological distress as measured by the K10. the measure comprises 10 questions that ask respondents how often they have experienced certain symptoms during the preceding four weeks. a minimum score is 10, indicating no psychological distress, and a maximum score is 50, indicating the most severe level of psychological distress. 8,000 addressees registered on the HECD;

recreational, equestrian, and breeding/stud sectors. 20.0 17.8 100 2 42.4 23.5 20.4 13.8 100 3 42.0 27.7 16.0 14.3 100 4+ 44.2 30.8 19.2 5.8 100 Educational qualifications None 32.7 23.6 25.5 18.2 100 0.161 School certificate 34.7 26.4 21.7 17.2 100 HSC 39.7 24.6 22.1 13.6 100 TAFE/Vocational 40.4 27.4 17.1 15.2 100 University/Tertiary 40.1 27.7 20.6 11.6 100 Australian State/ 0.001 No 42.4 27.7 18.1 11.8 100 The chi-square test was used to estimate p-values The greatest prevalence of'very high' psychological distress was reported for those respondents in the 16\u201324 age group (21.2%) the lowest prevalence was reported by those in the 55\u201364 age group and those under 16 (8.6% and 7.4%, respectively) the highest prevalence of'very high' psychological distress was recorded for those who were female, those with one child, and those with no formal educational qualifications. - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - those with school certificate as the highest level of formal education were 1.63 times more likely to have high psychological distress than those with university qualifications. but this result did not reach a level of statistical significance (p = 0.08) respondents in red zones (unadjusted: OR = 2.01, 95% CI: 1.58\u20132.55;

p 0.001) and amber zones (adjusted: OR = 1.83, 95% CI: 1.36\u20132.45; p 0.001) were at greater risk of high psychological distress. the most salient finding was the extremely high prevalence of high psychological distress in horse owners and those involved in the horse industry during a serious horse disease epidemic. the prevalence of'very high' psychological distress in this sample was approaching five times the level reported in recent population health data for NSW [24]. there is geographical overlap and co-linearity of the Australian State/Territory and EI control zone variables in the analysis. in the backward stepwise multiple logistic analyses excluding one made the other a significant factor. the high levels of psychological distress reported in Victoria were 1.57 times more likely to experience high psychological distress. the general population psychological distress is generally found to peak around middle age (40s\u201350s) the study findings would suggest that younger people were particularly vulnerable and were coping less well with the consequences of EI. research literature suggests that younger people form stronger emotional attachments to animals and are also less likely to be resilient or practised, generally, when it comes to coping with adversity. study focuses on risk perception and compliance with protective behaviours. it is likely that psychological distress would be far greater, since these present a threat to human health and possibly death. the target population is a complex, disparate, and unknown population. the high proportion of women in the sample may be due to greater interest and participation in studies of this nature. but the gender bias may reflect a gender bias in the main industry sub-populations in our data. it is not possible to explain why there was an absence of a gender difference in the data. the use of an online survey imposes potential limitations. it is likely that the study findings under-represent the responses of those in certain demographics, e.g. those who are less educated, those less affluent, and older respondents. not all horse owners would have access to the internet. enduring psychological distress is of critical importance given the increased prevalence of high psychological distress in young people in this study. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
