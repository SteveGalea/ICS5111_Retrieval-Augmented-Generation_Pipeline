{"summary": "MERS-CoV has been shown to cause severe acute respiratory illness. as of march 1, 2016, 1638 laboratory-confirmed cases (587 deaths; 36% case fatality rate [CFR]) have been reported to the world health organization. many secondary and tertiary cases of transmission occurred during the outbreak. the importance of characterizing viral populations as swarms with similar variants has led several groups to use next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies on clinical samples to explore the complexity of the spectrum of mutant viruses, including HIV-1 and hepatitis B virus. previous studies that recovered whole MERS-CoV genome sequences from dromedary camels revealed the existence of intrahost single-nucleotide variants (5%) 164, and 169 were HCWs and fourth-generation case patients who had been exposed to Patient 135.

Specimens from patients 50, 77, and 135 were obtained before and after respiratory failure. the sequence from Patient 14 in this study differed from the sequence from a previous study at two positions (Seong et al. 2016). the differences between the consensus sequences may have arisen from small technical variations in measurement.

Specimens from patients 50, 77, and 135 were obtained before and after respiratory failure. sequences of MERS-CoV isolates from the outbreak in south Korea were 100% identical to the previously described MERS-CoV isolates from the outbreak in south Korea. the sequence from Patient 14 in this study differed from the sequence from a previous study at two positions. /T C/G C/T A/G C/T A/G C/T A/G C/T A/G C/T A/G C/T A/T T/C T/C Amino acid change (reference/alternative) N/S S S/F A/P A/V S/F R/M S/G A/V L R T/S G H/Y S/R R/C D/G I/T V/L V I Q KT029139 was reported in Kim et al. 2015 and KT374057 were in Kim et al. 2016a. all sequences were aligned with the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) reference sequence (NC_019843.3) a significant number of nucleotide sites had mixed bases. we analyzed nucleotide variants present at a frequency greater than the sequencing error rate. errors introduced during reverse transcription and PCR amplification can significantly distort estimates of allele frequencies. a total of 16 positions displaying intrapatient heterogeneity were identified through statistical testing. the results from seven specimens were validated using Sanger sequencing. the double mutant carrying D510G and I529T is rare. the frequency of the double mutant was only 1.4% 0.3%. the single mutants and the wild type were present at 87.7% 1.9% and 6.5% 1.7%. of each single mutant, the combined frequency of both single mutants was consistently high in most samples. at the same time, the frequency of the wild type was no more than 10% in most samples. this suggests there was strong selection pressure favoring the variants of the spike glycoprotein with reduced affinity for the host receptor. we first selected 16 non-consensus variant candidates with frequencies significantly higher than those from technical noise. after removal of the two nonvalidated candidates, we ultimately listed a total of 14 non\u2013consensus variants, expecting an 89% validation rate. this suggests technical artifacts were highly unlikely to have generated such non\u2013consensus variants. a subset showed either C or T alone with little intrapatient heterogeneity. a subset showed either C or T alone with little intrapatient heterogeneity to Patient 14. we could not find significant differences in genetic variants based on disease severity group. 11 of those genomes had an I529T mutation in RBD, and one had a D510G mutation. authors suggested that adaptation during human-to-human spread might be driven by host immunological pressure such as neutralizing antibodies. characterization and quantification of neutralizing antibodies in patients over time is required to determine their association with the mutants. characterization and quantification of neutralizing antibodies in patients over time is required to determine their association with the mutants and to validate the hypothesis. MERS-CoVs were detected using real-time reverse transcription (rRT)-PCR. extracted RNAs were screened by targeting the upE region. positive results were confirmed by amplification of orf1a using a powerChek MERS real-time PCR kit. five microliters of viral RNA from each sample was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using a Superscript III First-Strand Synthesis System (Life Technologies) equal amounts of cDNA product were used to perform PCR with a Herculase II Fusion DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) a set of 60 primers was used to generate fifteen 2.5-kb overlapping amplicons. SAMtools v0.1.19 (Li et al. 2009), GATK v2.4-7 (McKenna et al. 2010) and Picard v1.93 were used for sorting SAM/BAM files, local realignment, and duplicate markings. consensus sequence was determined from the most commonly expressed nucleotide at each position. if the total depth was 100 at a given ijr, we treated it as missing. each variant allele frequency was tested by Z with a mean of E j b = ( i = 1 n N i j b ) / n and a variance of V j b = ( n 1 ). extracted RNAs were screened by targeting the upE region. positive results were confirmed by amplification of orf1a using a powerChek MERS real-time PCR kit. ten et al. (2013a) were used with minor modifications for efficient amplification. a set of 60 primers was used to generate fifteen 2.5-kb overlapping amplicons. primers and nucleotides were removed from the final PCR products using a miniElute PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) the consensus sequence was determined from the most commonly expressed nucleotide at each position. a phylogenetic analysis was performed after aligning the sequences using MUSCLE. a total of 30,130 aligned nucleotides were input into MEGA 7.0. each variant allele frequency was tested by Z with a mean of E j b = ( i = 1 n N i j b ) / n and a variance of V j b = ( i = 1 n ( N i j b E j b ) 2. replicates were available for only n samples.
