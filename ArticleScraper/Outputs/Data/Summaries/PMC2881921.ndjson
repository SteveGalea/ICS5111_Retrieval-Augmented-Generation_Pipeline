{"summary": "MT-PCR is a potentially powerful tool for the differential diagnosis of influenza-like illness in the clinical diagnostic laboratory. a relatively non-specific presentation means that influenza cannot be reliably distinguished from other ILI presenting in the autumn and winter seasons. direct immunofluorescence tests are widely available for influenza and RSV. they take only about 15-30 minutes to perform, but their sensitivity is lower than nucleic acid testing (NAT) this is not generally available in any rapid methods. anti influenza A and B, RSV, adenoviruses, and hPIV1-3 on acetone-fixed smears of material from respiratory tract specimens.

PIV-1, hPIV-3, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus OC43, hMPV, enterovirus EV-68, adenovirus type 3 and adenovirus type 4) were tested using Influenza Profile 1 (INF-A, INF-B, RV, RSV, H1, H3, H5) in blinded fashion in the lab at which the assays were developed. signals were all normalised against an internal control value one haemagglutinin type gave a greater than 100-fold fluorescence signal than another after normalization against the internal control. only 2 l of eluate (equivalent to the same concentration of virus if extraction efficiency was 100%) was used for analysis (5 l is recommended for extracted nasal pharyngeal samples) cells 10-1 a63904 - 67191 H1 Cells 10-2 4856 - 8362 H1 Cells 10-3 2492 - - 3023 H1 Cells 10-4 188 - - 231 H1 H3N2 (A/Fijian/114/2002-like) Cells 10-1 66 33064 - 4734 H3 Cells 10-2 - 6456 - 931 H3 Cells 10-3 - 1570 - 9234 7055 H5 Cells 10-6 (10-1/l) 9 - - 234 (INF-A) a values obtained after normalisation against internal control; b copies of virus per l in each original sample. MT-PCR recognised all of the known positive INF-A samples, with normalised values of 136-2379 and 4306-264304 respectively. s from the same patients had been positive for INF-A in another four cases. these additional INF-A detections were all low-level (normalised result 100) but all had correct-sized discrete second-stage amplicons as determined on Bioanalyzer (Agilent, SantaClara, CA) influenza profile 3: INF-A, INF-B, H1, H3, RSV, RV, hPIV-3) tested this profile independently in two clinical laboratories. previous result MT-PCR resulta IF CIDM (total) 276 INF-A (unspecified) 38 35 (H3 n = 28) INF-B 1 1 RSV 15 15 hPIV-3 3 3 total +ve 56 73 (53 +INF-A n = congruent results were obtained in 53/56 IF-positive specimens. three of the 38 INF-A specimens were not detected by MT-PCR. two of these three could not be confirmed by RT-PCR for INF-A. serial INF-A values alone may be misleading if the number of cells in the sample varies significantly. expressing the INF-A value as a function of the normalised value of the human NONO (non-POU domain containing, octamer-binding) gene. Combined nose and throat swabs collected at the centre for infectious diseases and microbiology in the southern hemisphere winter of 2006 and 2007 were used for initial assay validation at the Centre for Immunology at St Vincents Hospital in Sydney. mrs irradiated MDCK-tissue culture extracts with known amounts of Indonesian (Indo 05, Indonesia \"clade 2\") strains of H5N1 influenza A virus were provided Australia-wide as control templates. a nested reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to detect influenza A and B and other respiratory viruses. DNA sequences of all PCR amplicons were determined as needed by cloning into pGEM-T for M13 dye primer sequencing. the melt temperature, with a range of 1.5\u00b0C either side of predicted Tm, was deemed acceptable if the melt curve was normal sigmoidal.

INF-A/NONO ratios in Table 5 were derived from assays of serial samples of patients treated with oseltamivir for influenza A during the course of management of an institutional outbreak. a 6.7 92.8 61.9 b 139.8 43.3 6.4 c 900.0 666.7 0 d 21.2 4.2 0 e 26523.8 90.9 0 f 26.7 315.3 0 g 200.7 9.61 0 h 335. the MT-PCR method is essentially a nested RT-PCR. it would therefore be expected to be more sensitive than a conventional PCR or direct antigen detection system. the MT-PCR method is essentially a nested RT-PCR. MT-PCR correctly identified 141 (97.9%) of 144 clinical specimens found positive by standard methods. IF detected a significant pathogen in 56/73 (77%) and in-house RT-PCRs detected 87/88 (99%). IF and MT-PCR were entirely congruent in clinical specimens tested for INF-B (n = 17), RSV (n = 44) and hPIV-3 (n = 14). RT-PCR was 58/64 (91%). human Influenza virus replicates throughout the respiratory tract. viral loads normally peak at 24-72 hours after onset of symptoms. RNA targets are likely to be both host- and strain-specific. influenza A/H1N1/09 pandemic caused a significant number of intensive care admissions and deaths in this country. results in the Australian 2009 influenza season appear comparable to a nested RT-PCR specifically optimised for A/H1N1/09 only [9,10] multiplexed tandem (MT)-PCR is comparable to target-specific RT-PCR. this method simultaneously subtypes Influenza A, identifies multiple pathogens and co-infections in a single specimen. multiplexed method also facilitates recognition of co-circulating viruses. JI conceived the project, obtained the funding, oversaw the assays in CIDM in conjunction with KM and DD, analysed the data with KS, ES, KT and DD. all authors have read and approved the final manuscript."}
