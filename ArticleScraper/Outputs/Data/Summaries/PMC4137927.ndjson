{"summary": "whole cell bacterins for parenteral delivery (4) and single component (5) and combination (6) intranasal (IN) vaccines containing modified-live Bb were developed to protect dogs from disease associated with Bb infection. a similar pathogen, Bordetella pertussis (Bp), in the prevaccination era was one of the major killers in childhood (8). study examined antibody responses stimulated in dogs by the current parenterally delivered acellular vaccine. the dogs had been subjects in unrelated nutrition experiments, but were not being used at the time of this study. all dogs had been vaccinated parenterally for canine \u201ccore\u201d antigens. client-owned dogs were vaccinated with a whole-cell Bb bacterin (Coughguard-B; Pfizer Animal Health, Kirkland, Quebec), or single component intranasal Bb vaccine (Nasasguard B, Pfizer Animal Health) in previous experiments were used for comparison (Group C) the client-owned dogs were bled with the consent of the owners. e ELISA at Vx \u2014 units of IgG in B. bronchiseptica ELISA. f inhibition \u2014 % increased inhibition of bacterial growth. 1 of the commingled adult beagles was an unvaccinated contact control. the bacterial antigen was prepared from confluent 24-h cultures of the Regina-1 isolate (7). bacteria were suspended in saline solution, and aliquots were frozen at 70\u00b0C until use. the optimal dilution of antigen was determined in a standard checkerboard design. blank wells containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 0.2% gelatin were also used. a cut-off value was previously determined to indicate seropositivity for Bb (3). the OD at 570 nm was measured using the microplate reader and the commercial software. aqueous bulk antigen preparation of the acellular vaccine was obtained from the WCVM. separated proteins were compared to those in 5 L of a prestained protein ladder. separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membrane strips were rinsed 3 times in PBS-T containing 1% skim milk. study populations 8 adult 2- to 3-year-old clinically normal male and female beagle dogs were group housed at the Western College of Veterinary Medicine. dogs had been subjects in unrelated nutrition experiments, but were not being used at the time of this study. all dogs had been vaccinated parenterally for canine \u201ccore\u201d antigens. the client-owned dogs were vaccinated and bled with the consent of the owners. all dogs were maintained and handled using procedures consistent with, and approved by, the Canadian Council of Animal Care. e ELISA at Vx \u2014 units of IgG in B. bronchiseptica ELISA. f inhibition \u2014 % increased inhibition of bacterial growth. 1 of the commingled adult beagles was an unvaccinated contact control. the optimal dilution of antigen was determined in a standard checkerboard design. the wells were filled with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution containing 0.05% Tween 20 and 1% gelatin. plates were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and washed. OD values were converted to ELISA units that were derived as a percentage of the OD values of test wells. a \u201ccut-off\u201d value > 15 units was previously determined to indicate seropositivity for Bb (3). the OD at 570 nm was measured using the microplate reader and the commercial software. controls included the assessment of Bb growth in wells containing no serum and no complement and growth in fetal calf serum. sensitivity of the assay is 0.1 ng/mm2 (18) for immune blots, separated proteins were electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose membranes. membrane strips were rinsed 3 times in TBS-T and washed 3 10 min in TBS-Tsm. all 8 adult beagle dogs in group A had prevaccination (baseline) IgG ELISA units 15. all of the vaccinated beagles had variably increased concentrations of Bb-reactive IgG antibodies in serum after the first dose of the acelluar vaccine. 5 of the 7 vaccinated beagle dogs had variable increases in Bb-reactive IgA antibodies in serum that were less pronounced than in the IgG responses. seven dogs were vaccinated on days 0 and 14, and serum was collected for ELISA on days 0 and 14. one commingled dog (*) was not vaccinated. prevaccination antibody levels and serologic responses to 1 injection of acellular vaccine were more variable in client-owned dogs in group B. bacterial killing/inhibition by the serum (antibodies) was not associated with vaccination for Bb or changes in amounts of Bb-reactive antibody as indicated by the ELISA. in control microcultures, bacterial growth was reduced by approximately 1/3 compared to similar microcultures with no complement. client-owned dogs in group B recognized or had increased binding to an approximately 68-kD protein. a second protein of approximately 220 kD was less consistently recognized by antibodies in the same serum samples. these responses were similar to those found in dogs that had received the whole cell bacterin or modified-live intrasal vaccines in group C. all 8 adult beagle dogs in group A had prevaccination (baseline) IgG ELISA units 15. all of the vaccinated beagles had variably increased concentrations of Bb-reactive IgG antibodies in serum after the first dose of the acelluar vaccine. 5 of the 7 vaccinated beagle dogs had variable increases in Bb-reactive IgA antibodies in serum that were less pronounced than in the IgG responses. seven dogs were vaccinated on days 0 and 14, and serum was collected for ELISA on days 0 and 14. one commingled dog (*) was not vaccinated. prevaccination antibody levels and serologic responses to 1 injection of acellular vaccine were more variable in client-owned dogs in group B. bacterial growth was reduced by approximately 1/3 in microcultures containing no serum, either Bb-seronegative canine serum, or fetal calf serum. bacterial growth was reduced by approximately 1/3 compared to similar microcultures with no complement. group B recognized or had increased (greater intensity of staining on western blots) binding to an approximately 68-kD protein. a second protein of approximately 220 kD was less consistently recognized by antibodies in the same serum samples. these responses were similar to those found in dogs that had received the whole cell bacterin or modified-live intrasal vaccines in group C. the acellular Bb vaccine stimulated systemic antibody responses in most dogs that received a single dose of the product upon entry to a humane society (3). the results of this study confirm and extend those observations in 2 populations of dogs in which we were better able to exclude natural exposure to Bb as contributing to the responses. 3 dogs from 2 suburban households had high concentrations of Bb-specific antibodies 6 to 9 mo after IN vaccination. the results demonstrate the marked variation in exposure and extant response to Bordetella spp. antigens that can occur in dogs in a representative veterinary practice. bacterial killing assay is an in vitro model of IgG and complement mediated \u201cimmune elimination\u201d (24) it is likely that antibodies that bind to the 68-kD protein (pertactin) are responsible for bactericidal activity (25,26) a similar consetellation of antigen specific responses occurs in dogs after exposure to Bb antigens. pertactin appears to be immunodominant in vaccinated or infected dogs. antibody responses against p68 have disease sparing effects in infected pigs. the current acellular Bp vaccines confer a shorter duration of immunity than did the previously used whole cell bacterins (33). the latter phenomenon is thought to derive, at least in part, from the altered immunogenicity and immunodominance of constituents in the current vaccines, inducing antibody responses that apparently drive bacterial evolution. 35,36"}
