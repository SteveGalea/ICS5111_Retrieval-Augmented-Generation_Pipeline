{"summary": "pathogenic studies focusing on hand, foot and mouth disease have shown that enterovirus 71 (EV71) is one of the major pathogens responsible for human cases of HFMD. multiple clinical and pathological studies focusing on the fatal cases of HFMD suggest that the brainstem encephalitis caused by EV71 infection of the central nervous system (CNS) and subsequent neurogenic heart and lung failure ultimately contribute to the severe pathogenesis in these human patients. the pathogenic process did not result in severe neurogenic heart failure or pulmonary edema. however, there was remarkable alveolar inflammatory effusion and partial destruction of the alveolar wall, among other pathological changes. microaary analysis can harness the systematic gene expression profile and its variability between tissues or cells with specific response states. the EV71 virus (sub-genotype C4) was originated from an epidemic in china, 2008. the virus was grown in vero cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) and harvested for freezing at 20\u00b0C. the animals were bred separately in a large room (BSL-2 conditions) nine health rhesus monkeys infants (40 to 50-days-old) with weights ranging from 250 g to 350 g were divided into the following two groups. all infants were kept with their own mothers in single stainless steel cages during the entire experimental period. all live animals were monitored daily for clinical signs under anesthesia twice a day. body temperature was measured by inserting a soft probe attached to an Omron electronic digital stick thermometer into the rectum 2 cm from the anal margin for one minute. immunohistochemical examination for the immunohistochemical analysis. tissue samples were embedded in an optimal cutting temperature compound. frozen tissues were then cut into 4 m sections, placed on glass slides. transcript of conserved housekeeping gene GAPDH was used to normalize the samples because the GAPDH expression level is relatively constant. total RNA was collected from the PBMCs using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) the extracted RNA was temporarily frozen in 95% ethanol. slides were scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent) and normalized using the quantile algorithm with Gene Spring 11.0 (Agilent) the raw data were obtained using the Feature Extraction Software 10.7 (Agilent) and normalized using the quantile algorithm. the EV71 virus was originated from an epidemic in china, 2008. the virus was grown in vero cells (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) the animals were kept in DMEM (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) nine health rhesus monkeys infants (40 to 50-days-old) with weights ranging from 250 g to 350 g were divided into the following two groups. all infants were kept with their own mothers in single stainless steel cages during the entire experimental period. daily examination of the animals All live animals were monitored daily for clinical signs under anesthesia twice a day. body temperature was measured by inserting a soft probe attached to an Omron electronic digital stick thermometer into the rectum 2 cm from the anal margin for one minute. the tissue samples were embedded in an optimal cutting temperature compound (Miles Inc., Elkhart, Ind.) and frozen in liquid nitrogen. frozen tissues were then cut into 4 m sections, placed on poly-L-lysine-coated glass slides and fixed in 3.7% paraformaldehyde. the endogenous peroxidase activity of the tissues was inhibited by treatment with hydrogen peroxide (2.5%) the total RNA was collected from the PBMCs using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) and purified using an RNeasy Mini kit. the extracted RNA was temporarily frozen in 95% ethanol. slides were scanned using an Agilent Microarray Scanner (Agilent) the raw data were obtained using the Feature Extraction Software 10.7 (Agilent) and normalized using the quantile algorithm with Gene Spring 11.0 (Agilent). the systemic bioinformatic analyses of microarrays test were processed by Novel Bioinformatics Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China). more than 1000 genes were up- or down-regulated to varying degrees. expression of 85 genes was altered at all 3 time points tested. expression of 55 genes that varied on day 4 p.i. was restored to their original levels on day 7 p.i. and again on day 10 p.i. gene ontology analysis of the differential genes in the PBMCs from infected and un-infected infants during 4, 7 and 10 days p.i. the values are shown on a log2 P-value scale. the results suggest clear changes in the gene expression profile of PBMCs. expression of genes associated with cellular metabolism and structure was up-regulated 74-fold compared to baseline [26]. expression of genes associated with cellular metabolism and structure was gradually down-regulated. expression of genes associated with the NOD-like receptor or the NF-kappa B signaling pathway was gradually down-regulated. a clear up-regulation in the expression of more than 50 genes associated with the immune inflammatory responses during the period of 4 to 10 days p.i. the expression of interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-4, and so on, tended to be up-regulated (Fig. 3a). cytokines were up-regulated during the progression of viral infection. however, the up-regulation of cytokines was asynchronous in serum and CSF. expression levels of 2 particular genes were interesting. the y-axis indicates the relative quantity of the IL-17 mRNA in the samples compared with the control (Y = 1). the samples were collected at days 4, 7 and 10 p.i.. individual detection was performed in triplicate. Error bars are presented as the meanSD. TAC1 is transiently over-expressed in PBMCs and consistently up-regulated in the CNS. this gene encodes substance P and neurokinin A, which functions crucial neurotransmittors and specific neuromodulators of the immune system. peptides also play significant roles in neuron-inflammatory events, including the generation of blood vessel anapetia. a histochemical examination using an anti-substance P monoclonal antibody revealed a high expression of substance P, encoded by the TAC1 gene, in the thalamus and the posterior horn of the spinal cord. a product of the TAC1 gene, specifically substance P, might play a crucial role in the initiation of the pathogenic events during the progression of EV71 infection. this type of cytokine is usually produced either by the Th17 subtype of T lymphocyte IL-17A expression may have pathological significance in EV71 infection. this effect may be attributed to its role in the immune response. the EV71 infection process is associated with the modulation of gene expression in PBMCs. the colors indicate the number of significantly modulated genes at day 4 (red), 7 (purple) and 10 p.i. (yellow) different sets show the number of modulated genes at different time point. routine blood measurements indicated a clear increase in the lymphocyte population, similar to other viral infections. a marked up-regulation of over 20 genes associated with cellular transcriptional regulation was up-regulated 74-fold compared to baseline [26]. color scale indicates levels of gene expression from low (green, blue and purple) to high (red, pink and yellow). modulation of expression levels of genes required for pro-inflammatory events in EV71-infected rhesus infants. color scale indicates levels of gene expression from low (green, blue and purple) to high (red, pink and yellow) all cytokine levels were measured with a Th1/Th2 cytokine cytometric bead array kit. expression levels of 2 particular genes were interesting. color scale indicates levels of gene expression from low (green, blue and purple) to high (red, pink and yellow) levels of TAC1 gene expression in the thalamus and spinal cord from the EV71-infected rhesus monkey infants were measured by real-time qPCR. the y-axis indicates the relative quantity of the TAC1 mRNA in the samples compared with the control (Y = 1). the expression of IL-17 in lung tissues was measured by an immunohistochemical assay. the samples were tested with an anti-IL17A antibody and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG antibody. the expression was normalized to the endogenous GAPDH expression level. qRT-PCR and immunohistochemical assays were performed to detect the expression of substance P in the CNS and lung tissues from EV71-infected rhesus infants at 4, 7 and 10 days p.i. qRT-PCR analyses showed that the TAC1 gene was up-regulated 18-, 12- and 9-fold in the CNS on days 4, 7 and 10 days p.i., respective to non-infected controls. a study of the potential function of IL-17A in the pathological injury demonstrated that IL-17A is a crucial factor in the mechanism of the lung host defense and the associated pathogenic damage [44], [45]. a study of the potential function of IL-17A in the pathological injury demonstrated that IL-17A is a crucial factor in the mechanism of the lung host defense and the associated pathogenic damage. no IL-17A expression was noted in the CNS tissues (data not shown) a close correlation exists between the mechanism of EV71 pathogenicity and an abnormal immune response. the significant functional genes associated with immune activity displayed in the gene expression profile of PBMCs in the EV71 infected animals imply that there is an integral systemic immune response. the up-regulation of some pro-inflammatory cytokines was observed. tachykinins most likely showed a more important constricting effect on the smaller bronchi and microvascular of the bronchi and alveoli in asthmatic subjects [53], [54], [55], [56]. IL-17 also plays a crucial role in the inflammatory processes, which could lead to autoimmunity and host defense. the expression level of IL-17A in the lungs of EV71-infected animals showed a sustained increase compared with the control group. this suggests a positive feedback cycle in which the allergic effects could be amplified by the increased neutrophil recruitment by IL-17A. bars represent the mean SD.
