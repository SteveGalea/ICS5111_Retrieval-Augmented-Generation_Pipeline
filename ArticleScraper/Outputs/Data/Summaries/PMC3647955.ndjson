{"summary": "the diagnosis of pulmonary invasive aspergillosis poses a significant challenge in clinical practice due to the fact that symptoms and signs of it are neither sensitive nor specific (1, 2). this also holds for conventional chest X rays and cultures of sputum and/or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens. computed tomography of the lungs is a sensitive but nonspecific test (3). exhaled air is known to contain thousands of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) derived from various metabolic pathways (10) these VOCs can be used as biomarkers of lung disease, as has been demonstrated for bronchial carcinoma, infectious diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prospective proof-of-principle study. patients excluded if they were previously diagnosed with invasive mycosis. patients excluded if they were previously diagnosed with invasive mycosis. every prophylactic, diagnostic, and treatment-related procedure was performed according to standard care. each patient received 500 mg amphotericin B orally every 6 h. the workup consisted of (i) analysis of sputum specimens (using direct microscopy and culture), (ii) high-resolution CT of the thorax and (iii) in the case of abnormalities on the high-resolution CT scan consistent with invasive pulmonary mycosis, bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) the workup consisted of (i) analysis of sputum specimens (using direct microscopy patients were asked to breathe through a mouthpiece for 5 min with their nose clipped. through a three-way nonrebreathing valve, this mouthpiece was connected to an inspiratory VOC filter (A2; North Safety, Middelburg, The Netherlands) a deep inspiratory capacity maneuver was followed by exhalation of a vital capacity volume. the discriminant function was chosen to distinguish best between categories. cross-validation using the leave-one-out method was used to calculate the cross-validated accuracy. the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the exact binomial test. in the event of no possible, probable, or proven aspergillosis, the patient qualified as a case. exhaled breath analysis was performed only once for each patient. patients with possible aspergillosis might truly have invasive aspergillosis. from the start of neutropenia, cultures of the throat, nose, rectum, and, if possible, sputum specimens were performed weekly. both procedures were continued until the peripheral neutrophil count exceeded 0.5 109 neutrophils/liter. a complete diagnostic workup was performed in the case of a number of standardized indications for a diagnostic workup. a virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, enterovirus, enterovirus, adenovirus, herpes simplex virus, and cytomegalovirus were performed. a throat gargle specimen was examined using PCRs for the above-mentioned respiratory viruses. every diagnostic workup was followed by exhaled breath analysis, as described previously. data reduction by principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to reduce the original data from the 32 sensors to a nonpredefined number of principal components. t tests were used to assess which PCA factors discriminated between the two groups. a categorical division was made using linear canonical discriminant analysis, assuming equal chances of being a member of one of the two groups. sensitivity and specificity were 100% (95% CI, 48% to 100%) and 83.3% (95% CI, 36% to 100%), respectively. 2.2% of the 100,000 random classifications resulted in cross-validated accuracy of 90.9%. no No 5 51 F AML Induction N 0.2 n.p.
