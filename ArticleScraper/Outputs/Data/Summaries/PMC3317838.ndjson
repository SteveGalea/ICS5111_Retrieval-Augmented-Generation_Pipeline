{"summary": "human hepatoma cell lines have been evaluated for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection in vitro. so far only Huh7 cells have been found to be highly permissive for infectious HCV. a panel of hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines assessed their ability to support HCV infection. between 130 and 170 million individuals are chronically infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a positive-strand RNA virus that infects the liver. 80% of patients fail to clear the virus resulting in a chronic infection associated with the development of significant liver disease. despite this obvious public health burden, there is no vaccine to prevent infection. to identify other cell lines suitable for HCV infection studies, we assembled a panel of hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines and assessed their permissiveness for HCVcc infection. a comprehensive analysis of the permissiveness of human hepatic and non-hepatic cell lines for HCVcc infection has yet to be reported. cells were infected with pseudotyped lentiviruses encoding a luciferase reporter and bearing the glycoproteins E1 and E2 of HCV genotype 2a (JFHpp), HCV E1 and E2 of genotype 1a (H77pp) or the VSV G glycoprotein (VSVGpp). at 72 h post infection, pseudoparticle entry was assessed by luciferase activity as previously described. indicated cell lines were infected with HCVcc at an MOI of 2.0 FFU/cell. intracellular RNA was collected 72 h p.i. and HCV RNA is displayed as HCV RNA copies/g total cellular RNA. Caco-2 cells have previously been reported to support suboptimal HCVcc infection [35]. the low levels of HCV RNA (p value > 0.05) measured in these infected cultures are likely due to receptor-bound HCV similar to that of the non-permissive parental HepG2 cell line. hepatoma-derived hepatoma-derived cells lines share similar hepatocytes-like characteristics with Huh7 cells. these lines also share permissiveness for both HCVpp and HCVccc infection albeit to different degrees. expression of HCV entry factors on hepatoma cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis or IF. total RNA was extracted from Huh7, PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells. mRNA copies were determined by RTqPCR using standard curves. we transiently transfected PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells with vectors expressing the four known human HCV receptors. expression of HCV entry factors in trans individually (Figure 3) or in combination (data not shown) did not enhance HCVpp or HCVcc (Figure 3D-F) infectivity of PLC, Hep3B or HepG2-CD81 cells. 65% less luciferase activity generated when cells were ino /g total cellular RNA SD for triplicate samples determined 72 h p.i. both PLC and Hep3B cells support equivalent levels of HCV RNA replication. reduced permissiveness for HCVcc infection compared to Huh7 cells may be due to defects in HCV RNA replication. RTqPCR analysis revealed relatively similar levels of HCV sg2a RNA replication in all three cell lines. no significant difference in mean HCV RNA copies/g intracellular RNA was observed between Huh7, PLC and Hep3B clones. the cumulative efficiency of HCVccc entry plus subsequent RNA replication is relatively equivalent in PLC, Hep3B, and Huh7 cells. we cured fl2a clones by IFN-treatment and re-assessed their permissiveness for HCVcc infection. HCV RNA is displayed as mean HCV RNA copies/g total cellular RNA SD for each clone. the early events in HCV infection are equivalent or only marginally reduced in PLC and Hep3B respectively compared to Huh7 cells. HCV RNA levels began to decline at undetectable levels by day 7 p.i. in hep3B-infected cells, following a 1-2 log increase in HCV RNA levels during the first 72 h p.i., HCV RNA reached and maintained a low steady-state level of 2.1 103 6.9 102 copies/g RNA. analysis of HCV-positive cells by immunocytochemical staining of HCV E2 protein 5 days p.i indicated that only a small percentage of cells in the PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cultures were infected. we quantified the level of infectious HCVcc secreted into each infected cell line over the course of 7 days. increased infectious HCVcc levels were detected in the supernatant of HCV-infected Huh7 cells. however, at no time p.i. did we detect infectious HCVcc in the culture supernatants from HCV-infected PLC cells. supernatants were treated with S7 Micrococcal nuclease, RNA extracted and HCV genome copies quantified by RTqPCR. high levels of infectious HCVcc and nuclease-protected HCV RNA were detected in intracellular lysates from HCV-infected Huh7 cells. low levels of nuclease-protected HCV RNA were detected in intracellular lysates. the dashed line represents the lower limit of detection of the assay (101 FFU/ml) for extracellular RNA analysis, culture supernatant samples were treated with S7 Micrococcal nuclease prior to RNA purification. mRNA levels were not up-regulated in HCV-infected cells. induction of ISG56 was observed in the other three human hepatoma cell lines. the highest and most significant induction of ISG56 was observed in HCV-infected PLC cells. hepatoma cells were infected with JFH-1 HCVcc at an MOI of 1.0 FFU/cell. intracellular RNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR, normalized to GAPDH and is displayed as ISG56 mRNA copies/g total RNA. cells were infected with pseudotyped lentiviruses encoding a luciferase reporter and bearing the glycoproteins E1 and E2 of HCV genotype 2a (JFHpp), HCV E1 and E2 of genotype 1a (H77pp) or the VSV G glycoprotein (VSVGpp) at 72 h post infection (p.i.) pseudoparticle entry was assessed by luciferase activity as previously described. acellular RNA was collected 72 h p.i. and HCV RNA is displayed as HCV RNA copies/g total cellular RNA (means SD for triplicate samples) significant increases in HCV RNA levels compared to CHO cells are denoted as * p value 0.001. PLC cells and Hep3B cells were less permissive for HCVpp. they contained 10-fold higher HCV RNA levels (3.9 104 2.6 103 copies/g RNA) 72 h after infection with HCVcc compared to Huh7 cells. we first assessed the expression of the known HCV entry factors in these cells by measuring CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 and OCLN mRNA levels. when compared to Huh7, no significant difference in mRNA expression for the four known HCV entry factors was observed among the four cell lines. cell surface expression of HCV entry factors on Huh7, PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells was determined by flow cytometric analysis or IF. cells were trypsinized and stained with mouse anti-CD81 or anti-SR-BI monoclonal antibodies and an anti-mouse PE-conjugated secondary antibody. HCVpp and HCVcc infection in PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells exogenously over expressing HCV entry factors. HCVpp and HCVcc infection in PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells exogenously over expressing HCV entry factors. HCV sg2a replicons could be readily established in both cell lines. however, the ratio of colony formation to g of in vitro-transcribed RNA was considerably lower in both cells compared to Huh7 cells. levels of HCV sg2a RNA replication in all three cell lines. no significant difference (p value > 0.05) in mean HCV RNA copies/g intracellular RNA observed between Huh7, PLC and Hep3B clones. we cured fl2a clones by IFN-treatment and re-assessed their permissiveness for HCVcc infection. none of the fl2a clones showed enhanced permissiveness for HCVcc infection compared to their parental control. the 1.5 and 3 log reduction in HCVcc permissiveness is likely attributable to a defect(s) in a post replication step, such as assembly and/or egress of de novo HCVcc. to monitor multiple rounds of HCV infection and spread, we performed a kinetic analysis of HCV infection over the course of 7 days in Huh7 cells after infection with HCVcc at a low MOI. hepG2-CD81 cells were infected with JFH-1 in vitro-transcribed RNA. a similar profile of RNA expansion and kinetics was observed. we quantified the level of infectious HCVcc secreted into the supernatants of each infected cell line over the course of 7 days. infectious HCVcc was undetectable in the culture supernatant of HCV-infected PLC cells even at day 2 when the PLC cultures amplified a higher level of intracellular HCV RNA than the Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells. culture supernatants from infected PLC cells were treated with nuclease. extracellular nuclease-protected HCV RNA was detected in culture supernatant harvested from HCV-infected Huh7 cells. levels exponentially increased over the course of infection. increasing levels of infectious HCVcc and nuclease-protected HCV RNA were detected in intracellular lysates from HCV-infected Huh7 cells over the course of infection. in HCV-infected PLC cells, low levels of infectious HCVcc were detectable only on days 3 and 4 p.i. dashed line represents the background of the assay (101 HCV RNA copies/g carrier RNA) for intracellular infectivity titer and RNA analysis, cells were pelleted, re-suspended in complete 10% cDMEM and lysed via multiple freeze/thaws. ISG56 mRNA levels were not up-regulated in HCV-infected cells. induction of ISG56 was observed in the other three human hepatoma cells. the highest and most significant induction was observed in HCV-infected PLC cells. intracellular ISG56 mRNA was analyzed by RT-qPCR, normalized to GAPDH and is displayed as ISG56 mRNA copies/g total RNA. all non-hepatic cell lines were either refractory or marginally permissive for HCVpp and HCVcc infection. HCVpp infectivity was 65% lower in PLC cells compared to HCVpp-infected Huh7 and Hep3B cells. however, this level of HCV entry should be sufficient to support robust HCVcc infection. expression of four essential HCV entry factors (i.e. CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 and OCLN) by RTqPCR, flow cytometric and immunofluorescence analysis (Figure 2). Interestingly, no obvious differences in mRNA level or cell surface expression of CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 or OCLN was observed in PLC, Hep3B or HepG2-CD81 cells. 88, 77 and 52 G418-resistant colonies were formed in Huh7, PLC and Hep3B cultures. similar levels of intracellular HCV RNA replication were achieved in all three cell lines. iii. spread and infectious HCVcc production. HCV E2 staining on day 5 post-HCVcc infection revealed that the vast majority of Huh7 cells were HCV-positive while little to no spread was evident in the PLC, Hep3B or HepG2-CD81 cell cultures. however, only Huh7 cells appeared to support efficient viral spread. analysis of HCVcc present within the cell revealed low to undetectable levels of intracellular infectious virions. low levels of encapsidated HCV RNA suggest virion assembly is restricted at or before genome encapsidation. reduced ability of PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cell cultures to support robust steady-state infection levels. a more recent publication by marukian et al. shows a correlation between innate antiviral gene induction and impaired HCV replication and spread in primary liver cells. the differences in ISG induction observed between these cells lines may keep HCV replication lower on a per cell basis and successfully inhibit viral replication in the infected cells sufficiently to contribute to clearance of the infection. fatty acid metabolism and lipogenesis shown to be necessary for HCV replication, assembly and secretion. lack of adequate miR122 may also contribute to reduced HCV permissiveness of certain cell lines. clones generated in this study add to current repertoire of sub-genomic and full-length HCV replicons already available. reagents and cell lines amendable for the study of HCV should advance our understanding of the HCV viral life cycle and the cellular determinants involved. the perception that Huh7 cells are relatively unique in their ability to support HCV infection [34,46], we were surprised that HCVcc infection and replication could be readily detected in both Hep3B and PLC cells. the results from our initial screen (Figure 1) indicated that PLC and Hep3B cells are indeed permissive for both HCVpp and HCVcc infection. however, differences in permissiveness compared to Huh7 cells do exist. a systematic analysis of PLC and Hep3B permissiveness for HCVcc infection. expression of HCV entry factors in trans can enhance HCVpp and HCVccc entry in cells where HCV permissiveness is low. over-expression of CD81, SR-BI, CLDN1 or OCLN individually or in combination did not significantly increase HCVpp or HCVccc entry in any of the hepatoma cell lines. HCV RNA replication were achieved in all three cell lines. similar levels of intracellular HCV RNA were achieved in sg2a replicon cell clones. we measured infectious HCVcc in the supernatant of infected cultures. low steady-state levels of intracellular HCV RNA and infectious virus production in the Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells could result from a defect/bottleneck. induction of innate immune signaling can have negative affects on multiple steps in the HCV lifecycle. we assessed the ability of PLC, Hep3B and HepG2-CD81 cells to mount an innate immune response against HCV infection by measuring ISG56 mRNA induction, as a representative ISG, following HCVcc infection. interferon produced by the infected cell may be sufficient to signal to/activate adjacent nave cells rendering them resistant to infection. differences in ISG induction observed between these cells lines may keep HCV replication lower on a per cell basis. many positive determinants required for efficient HCV replication have also been identified. a panel of human hepatoma and non-hepatoma cells for HCVcc permissiveness tested new cell lines capable of supporting authentic HCVcc infection. the permissiveness of PLC and Hep3B cells for HCVcc infection is clearly less robust than that achieved in the highly HCVcc-permissive Huh7 cell lines. the clones generated in this study add to the current repertoire of sub-genomic and full-length HCV all human cell lines were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) all human cell lines were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Hyclone, Logan, UT) all human cell lines were cultured in complete Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) pseudotyped viruses were generated by co-transfection of DNA vectors encoding HCV or vesicular stomatitis virus. supernatants were collected 48 h post transfection, filtered through a 0.45 m-pore-size filter. for infections, cells were seeded 24 h prior to infection in 96-well plates. each cell line was seeded 24 h prior to infection in 96-well plates. cell confluence at the time of infection was 90%. triplicate wells were infected with JFH-1 HCV at an MOI of 0.01 FFU/cell. guanidine thiocyanate (GTC) was isolated using 1.6 GTC containing 2 g of murine total liver RNA. one g of purified RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using the TaqMan reverse transcription reagents. thermal cycling consisted of an initial 10 min denaturation step at 95\u00b0C followed by 40 cycles of denaturation (15 s at 95\u00b0C) TTC AG-3' (antisense), human CD81 [25] 5'-ACC TGT ATC TGG AGC TGG-3' (sense) and 5'-TTG GCG ATC TGG TGG TTG-3' (anti-sense), human SR-BI [25] 5'-TCG CAG GCA TTG GAC AAA CT-3' (sense) and 5'-CTC CTT ATC CTT TGA GCC CTT TT-3' (anti cells stained with irrelevant mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody and respective PE-conjugated secondary antibody served as negative controls. cells were washed three times, fixed in FACS buffer containing 4% (w/v) PFA. immunofluorescence analysis was performed as previously described [36] infected cells were diluted 1:500, seeded in 100 mm tissue culture dishes. colonies were expanded to establish replicon cell lines. infectivity titers were determined as described below. cell cultures were washed three times with 1 PBS, triedpsinized for 5 min at room temperature and cells resuspended in 1 ml of 10% cDMEM. cells were pelleted at 1,400 RPM for 5 min at 4\u00b0C, frozen and then thawed three times using a 95% ethanol:dry ice bath. media was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone), 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 mg/ml streptomycin, 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco Invitrogen) and in case of HCV replicon cells 500 g/ml G418 (Invitrogen) supernatants were collected 48 h post transfection, filtered through a 0.45 m-pore-size filter (BD Biosciences), aliquoted, frozen and titered using the QuickTiter Lentivirus Titer Kit (Cell Biolabs, Inc., San Diego, CA) for infections, cells were seeded 24 h prior to infection in 96-well plates. triplicate wells were infected with JFH-1 HCV at an MOI of 0.01 FFU/cell.
