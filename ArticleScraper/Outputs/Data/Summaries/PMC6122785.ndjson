{"summary": "the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) virus emerged from genetic segments from the human influenza virus, avian influenza virus, and swine influenza virus. in April 2009, preventive actions were initiated to delay entry of the virus to Brazil. the first cases of H1N1 influenza in Brazil were imported from countries that already had sustained transmission of the disease. the study modeled the spatiotemporal evolution of the 2009 influenza A (H1N1) epidemic in Paran\u00e1. the model was further used to identify the most-likely starting points of H1N1 diffusion into the state of paran\u00e1. the study area is Paran\u00e1 State in the southern region of Brazil. epidemiological data In paran\u00e1, active surveillance of suspected cases of influenza was initiated in April 5, 2009. any medical doctor diagnosing a suspected case should notify to the National Notification System, SINAN [8]. the proportion of mild cases remained high throughout the epidemic. altitude data (in meters) were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and are reported for the seat of each municipality. all stations had some missing meteorological data, for reasons such as malfunction of measuring instruments, reorganization of station networks, or occasional interruption of automatic stations. to address this problem, we used the regEM method (regularized EM algorithm) described in Suhaila et al. [9]. population density, pendular migration, and means of transportation were obtained through IBGE. information regarding means of transportation was extracted from the 2009 Basic Municipal Information Survey. cases were absent in about 70% of all observations. are confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) 0, if there are no confirmed cases, and the number of cases reported as y i t = omitted, if there are no cases of influenza A (H1N1) total number of cases, if they occurred. the likelihood of this model can be written by the combination of two likelihoods, given by a binomial distribution and a Poisson distribution truncated to zero (ZAP- Zero-Altered Poisson) for the random effect reflects the intuitive notion that the structure of temporal and spatial dependence in a given municipality depends on the spatiotemporal pattern of neighboring municipalities. i t = i, t - 1 + i t, where | | 1. is the number of municipalities bordering the municipality i, i j indicates that i and j are neighbors and 1 is the indicator function. the conditional variance is inversely proportional to the number of neighbors. i t = i, t - 1 + i t, where 0 z is the intercept that quantifies the average chance of disease occurrence in the municipalities of Paran\u00e1. the coefficients z and t z quantify the effects of covariates. the probability of influenza occurrence is given by the estimate of it/1 it. migration can increase the occurrence of flu since it favors the disease dissemination. population density and bus transportation are potential factors to increase the intensity of transmission. also, the density of physicians is supposed to impact the intensity of the disease. the most common approach is to make inference through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. in complex models, this method can be computationally expensive and difficult to assess the convergence. effective distance is defined based on the logarithm of the transition probability. we can define the effective length () of an ordered path = c1,..., cF as the sum of the effective distance between each step of the path. j represents the most likely sequence of paths from root municipality j to other municipalities. the arrival times in each municipality were defined as the first epidemiological week in which the probability of having an excess chance of influenza was greater than 0.90. the correlation coefficients between the effective distances and the times of arrival of the epidemic were calculated. this approach should result in greater correlation when a particular municipality j represents the starting point of the epidemic. epidemiological data In paran\u00e1, active surveillance of suspected cases of influenza was initiated in April 5, 2009. any medical doctor diagnosing a suspected case should notify to the National Notification System, SINAN [8]. Suspected cases were subsequentely confirmed or discarded. altitude data (in meters) were obtained from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) and are reported for the seat of each municipality. all stations had some missing meteorological data, for reasons such as malfunction of measuring instruments, reorganization of station networks, or occasional interruptions of automatic stations. influenza notification data were obtained through the Ministry of Health. population density, pendular migration, and means of transportation were extracted from the microdata of IBGE\u2019s 2010 census. occurrence of cases will be defined as z i t = 1, if there are confirmed cases of influenza A (H1N1) 0, and the number of cases reported as y i t = omitted, if there are no cases of influenza A (H1N1) total number of cases, if they occurred. quantifies the effect of L covariates x = (x(1),..., x(L)) and t y = ( 1 t y,..., P t y = ( 1 t y, y) quantifies the effect of P covariates w = (w(1), w(P)), which are assumed to vary in time according to a random first order process defined as p t y | p t 1 y Normal. j, se i j, (2) where ni is the number of municipalities bordering the municipality i, i j indicates that i and j are neighbors and 1 is the indicator function. the conditional variance is inversely proportional to the number of neighbors. z w i t = i, t - 1 + i t = i, t - 1 + i t = i, t - 1 + i t, where 0 z is the intercept that quantifies the average chance of disease occurrence in the municipalities of Paran\u00e1. the coefficients z and t z quantify the effects of covariates. impact the chance of occurrence, since they facilitate the displacement of people between municipalities. population density and bus transportation are potential factors to increase the intensity of transmission. also, the density of physicians is supposed to impact the intensity of the disease. s are assigned to the prior distributions of hyperparameters. log((1 + )/(1 ) Normal(0, 6.67), log() logGamma(1, 0.0005), log( z ) logGamma ( 1, 0.00005), log(/(1 )) Normal(0, 2.22) and Normal(1, 0.10). effective distance is defined based on the logarithm of the transition probability. we can define the effective length () of an ordered path = c1,..., cF as the sum of the effective distance between each step of the path. j represents the most likely sequence of paths from root municipality j to other municipalities. the arrival times in each municipality were defined as the first epidemiological week in which the probability of having an excess chance of influenza was greater than 0.90. for each candidate city, the correlation coefficients between the effective distances and the times of arrival of the epidemic were calculated. pendular migration, presence of air transport, and HDI significantly contributed to increase the chance of influenza. the effect of the covariate maximum lagged temperature of one week (lag 1) was assumed to vary over time, and therefore is omitted from Table 1. the mitigation phase began in EW 29 (07/19) in 2009, a period that preceded the declaration of sustained transmission of the virus. the actions recommended for this phase were aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality due to the disease through the early diagnosis and treatment of cases that presented greater risk for severe outcomes. there was high chance of influenza A in the capital Curitiba in the first week of April (EW 14) outbreaks began to spread, concentrating mainly on sites that were geographically distant but important from a socioeconomic perspective. from EW 24 (06/14 to 06/20), outbreaks began to spread, concentrating mainly on sites that were geographically distant but important from a socioeconomic perspective. two of the most populous municipalities in the western region of Paran\u00e1 maintained a high risk. from EW 32, there was a slow and progressive reduction of the risk of influenza A (H1N1) study aimed to characterize the spatiotemporal distribution of the influenza A pandemic in the Brazilian state of Paran\u00e1 from the introduction of the H1N1 virus until the end of the epidemic period in 2009. intervention with a focus on municipalities with greater flow and density of people, especially those with higher HDI and the presence of municipal air and road transport, could play an important role in mitigating the impact of future influenza pandemics. Xiao et al. analyzed the spatiotemporal spread of influenza A (H1N1) in Changsha, china in 2009. they showed that the regions with the highest incidence rates were concentrated in more economically developed areas, such as cities and economic districts. high population density in the district of Iztapalapa contributed to the spread of the influenza A (H1N1) epidemic in china. a study by Fang et al. [34] also indicated that population density contributed to the spread of the epidemic. a significant increase in the risk of influenza transmission was associated with a drop in temperature from weeks 21 to 28. the study also found a negative correlation between temperature and the prevalence of influenza A (H1N1) in a semi-arid region in india. a common limitation in ecological studies is the inability to control for effects of confounding factors at the individual level. a second limitation is probable sources of information bias, including under-reporting in asymptomatic persons, infected persons that do not seek medical help.
