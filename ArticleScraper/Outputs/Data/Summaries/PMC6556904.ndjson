{"summary": "proteases selectively cleave the peptide bonds between amino acids in specific protein or peptide substrates. this process is controlled by proteases that selectively cleave the peptide bonds between amino acids in specific protein or peptide substrates. proteases can precisely regulate a myriad of biological processes across all living organisms. current experimental methods for proteolytic cleavage characterization include one-dimensional and two-dimensional gel-based methods [12], N-terminal peptide identification methods (for identifying both substrates and cleavage sites) despite advances of these experimental methods, they are labor intensive, expensive and time-consuming, and are often limited to the investigation of one protease each time. iProt-Sub is a bioinformatic tool for predicting substrate cleavage sites for 23 proteases. it is the first comprehensive server capable of predicting cleavage sites of multiple proteases within a single substrate sequence. the server has attracted >25 000 unique users worldwide and has processed >60 000 job submissions since its inception. the cleavage site prediction models are trained and optimized to achieve best-performing prediction by performing a 5-fold cross-validation test. iProt-Sub is accessible through a user-friendly web application available at http://iProt-Sub.erc.monash.edu/. the new iProt-Sub web server provides a more user-friendly and interactive interface that enhances user experience. there are four major stages during the development of iProt-Sub. there are 11 types of extracted features. we removed sequence redundancy in the retrieved data set, so that any two sequences in the benchmark data set and independent test data set have a sequence identity of 70%. we ended up with 38 proteases with a total of 3688 substrates and 6637 cleavage sites. 89 9 M10.001 Matrix metallopeptidase-1 21 52 28 S01.251 Kallikrein-related peptidase 4 78 80 10 M10.002 Matrix

optimize parameters of machine learning algorithms, train the prediction model and evaluate model performance in an n-fold cross-validation manner. none of the substrate sequences in this constructed independent test data set appeared in the benchmark data set, which ensures that a fair assessment of model performance can be achieved. negative and negative samples greatly dominate the number of the positive samples (i.e. non-cleavage sites) sequence encoding schemes We formulate cleavage site prediction as a classification problem and solve it using machine learning techniques. each potential cleavage site is represented by a feature vector x with D-dimensional feature components x1,..., xD. the y will be defined as \u20181\u2019 if the site is a cleavage site for a protease, and \u20180\u2019 otherwise. a local window size of 16 amino acid residues was used to extract the features. one of the most challenging problems in computational biology is how to express a biological sequence with a discrete model or a vector. a protein sequence can be formulated as: P = [ 1 2 u ] T, (1) where T is a transpose operator, while the subscript is an integer and its value as well as the components u ( u = 1, 2, ) depend on the way to extract the desired information from the amino acid sequence of P. the concept of PseKNC (pseudo K-tuple nucleotide composition) [79, 80] was developed for generating various encoding reflects short-range interactions of residues within sequence surrounding potential cleavage sites. a feature vector can be defined as: ( N A A N t o t a l, N A C N t o t a l, N Y Y N t o t a l,..., N Y Y N t o t a l. the similarity score between two peptide sequences P 1 and P 2 is defined as: S c o r e = i = 1 n S ( P 1, i, P 2, i ), (3) S ( a, b ) = B L O S U M 62 ( a, b ), i f ( B L O S U M 62 ) 0, (4) where P is the peptide with n amino acids, i is the amino acid AAindex [63] is a database of amino acid indices and amino acid mutation matrices. in the current version of the AAindex database, 566 amino acid indices can be retrieved. a feature vector based on 11 types of features described above was generated using a sliding window of 16 amino acids. features that were assigned with higher ranking by mRMR were considered as having a better trade-off between their maximum relevance and minimum redundancy. the second step is to apply the FFS method to sequentially select the most representative subset of optimal features from the 100 OFCs identified above. a feature subset that resulted was then recognized as the optimal feature set. the SVR classifier is able to find a linear discriminative function of the form: f ( x ) = W T ( x ) + w 0, (6) where is a basis function that maps the D-dimensional feature vector to a higher dimension. the best discriminative function is the one that represents the largest separation or margin between the two classes of samples. a set of four intuitive metrics was derived [106, 107] based on the Chou\u2019s symbols introduced in the study of protein signal peptides. the above four metrics are not easy-to-understand for biologists, particularly the MCC. based on the definition of Equations (11)\u2013(14), the meanings of Sn, Sp, Acc and MCC have become much more intuitive and easier to understand. the meanings of Sn, Sp, Acc and MCC have become much more intuitive and easier to understand. overall workflow of iProt-Sub represents an advanced version of PROSPER [29] iProt-Sub represents an advanced version of PROSPER. iProt-Sub can be used to predict protease-specific substrates and cleavage sites for 38 different proteases. only experimentally verified substrate sequences and cleavage sites were retrieved. the annotations of experimentally verified cleavage sites and the corresponding proteases that cleave the target substrates were extracted from MEROPS. cleavage sites Number MEROPS ID Protease name Number of substrates Number of cleavage sites 1 A01.009

and negative samples, we used a local sliding window approach. the overall size of the sliding window was 16 sites. the sequence-encoding scheme plays a crucial role in determining the predictive performance of the machine learning-based model. we analyzed the relative predictive performance to identify effective combinations of features that could lead to the overall best predictive performance for a given protease. we also integrated evolutionary, physicochemical properties and predicted structural features. avalanche of protein sequences generated in post-genomic era is how to express a biological sequence with a discrete model or a vector. a vector defined in a discrete model may completely lose all sequence-pattern information. a powerful web server called \u2018Pse-in-One\u2019 [91] and its updated version \u2018Pse-in-One2.0\u2019 [92] have been established that can be used to generate any desired feature vectors for protein/peptide and DNA/RNA sequences according to the need of users\u2019 studies. this includes: Binary sequence profile feature (termed as BINARY), which refers to the encoding of amino acid sequences using the 21-bit (20 amino acid types plus a 21-th the amino acid pair AA is equal to n divided by the total number of 0-spaced amino acid pairs ( N t o t a l ) in the local sliding window of cleavage site. the value of N t o t a l is L\u2014(k + 1). aAC is based on the calculation of the occurrence frequency of each of the 20 natural amino acids in a local window. the frequencies of all 20 natural amino acids (i.e. \u2018ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY\u2019) can be calculated as: f (a) = N (a ) L, a A, C, D,..., Y, (5) where N (a ) is the number of occurrences of amino acid a, while L is each candidate cleavage site was represented by feature vector x with 4562 feature components x1,..., x4562. avalanche of protein sequences generated in post-genomic era is how to express a biological sequence with a discrete model

amino acid pair AA appears n times in the sequence, the composition of the amino acid pair AA is equal to n divided by the total number of 0-spaced amino acid pairs ( N t o t a l ) in the local sliding window. i f ( B L O S U M 62 ) 0, (4) where P is the peptide with n amino acids, i is the amino acid position in the sequence and b is the corresponding element value for amino acids a and b in the BLOSUM62 matrix. in this study, we set K = 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9% of the total numbers of positive and negative samples. the BLOSUM62 matrix [62] is used to represent the sequence information surrounding a potential cleavage site, which reflects the similarity of two sequence fragments. we also incorporated structural information predicted from protein sequences. each candidate cleavage site was represented by a feature vector x with 4562 feature components x1,..., x4562. the feature subset that resulted was then recognized as the optimal feature set. we obtained 38 protease-specific SVM models optimized by this two-feature selection strategy based on the benchmark training substrate data set for each protease. the best discriminative function is the one that represents the largest separation or margin between the two classes of samples. for implementation of the SVR algorithm, we used the LibSVM software package [102] with the regression mode. the model performance was fully evaluated by using 5-fold cross-validation and independent tests. TP, TN, FP and FN denote the numbers of true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives respectively. a set of four intuitive metrics was derived [106, 107] based on the Chou\u2019s symbols introduced in the study of protein signal peptides [104, 105], which are given below. based on the definition of Equations (11)\u2013(14), the meanings of Sn, Sp, Acc and MCC have become much more intuitive and easier to understand. the meanings of Sn, Sp, Acc and MCC have become much more intuitive and easier to understand. iProt-Sub models trained using different encoding schemes and their combinations for cleavage site prediction of eight proteases on the 5-fold cross-validation test. the \u2018mRMR-FS\u2019 model achieved the overall best performance, after the two-step feature selection, compared with other models for the MMP cleavage site prediction. the performance of cleavage site prediction with the MMP family is much worse in terms of the AUC score. the CKSAAP model only achieved an AUC of 0.502 and 0.581 for the cleavage site predictions of MMP-2 and MMP-3 respectively, compared with that of 0.914 and 0.922 for the cleavage site prediction. the sequence logos in Figure 3 show conserved sequence motifs or distinctive sequence patterns surrounding protease-specific substrate cleavage sites. a predominant characteristic of substrate cleavage sites of caspases is the requirement of Asp residue at the P1 position. granzyme B (human) has a more complicated preference favoring a number of residue types across different positions surrounding the cleavage sites. mRMR algorithm combines mRMR algorithm with FFS to characterize a subset of optimal features that contributed the most to the prediction of substrate cleavage sites of each protease. the feature selection curve in stepwise feature selection describes the performance change as a function of the number of gradually increased OFCs. the three most important types of features are KNN features with a contribution percentage ranging from 6.67% (for caspase-8) to 98.55% (for caspase-7), AAC features with a contribution percentage ranging from 1.45% (for caspase-7) to 54.54% (for caspase-6), and BINARY features with a contribution percentage ranging from 1.45% (for caspase-7) performance comparison between iProt-Sub and other general prediction tools. we performed an independent test and compared the performance of iProt-Sub with three tools that can be used to predict substrate cleavage sites for multiple proteases. poPS is one of the most popular bioinformatics tools for modeling and predicting substrate specificity. it creates a simple matrix-based specificity model with different weights for amino acid residues at different positions. the specificity model can be used to score, predict and rank likely cleavage sites within a given substrate sequence. iProt-Sub is able to provide a competitive predictive performance of substrate cleavage site prediction when compared with three existing prediction tools. iProt-Sub Web server was designed with a user-friendly interface and modern data visualization functionality. the prediction task will generally take approximately 3 min to calculate the features and return the final prediction results. a step-by-step guideline of how to use the iProt-Sub Web server can be found at http://iProt-Sub.erc.monash.edu.au/help.html. iProt-Sub is the most comprehensive server capable of predicting substrate cleavage sites of multiple proteases within a single substrate sequence. features include 11 previously mentioned feature encoding schemes. iProt-Sub offers advantages over existing prediction servers in its ability to identify potential substrates. the statistics for the predicted substrate proteins and cleavage sites are shown in Table 3. a complete list of the predicted substrates for each protease and their corresponding substrate cleavage sites is available from the iProt-Sub website. BP terms \u2018Cell adhesion\u2019 and \u2018Biological adhesion\u2019 and \u2018adenyl ribonucleotide binding\u2019. similar tendencies can also be observed between the MMP-2 and MMP-3 substrates. calpastatin (calcium-dependent cysteine protease) inhibitor is encoded by the CAST gene in humans. it consists of an N-terminal domain and four repetitive calpain-inhibitory domains. all three experimentally verified cleavage sites were on top-ranking list of hits. iProt-Sub is a machine learning-based approach and as such, its predictive power derives from the machine learning models that are trained based on different forms of sequence encoding schemes. the first limitation is that iProt-Sub is a machine learning-based approach and as such, its predictive power derives from the machine learning models. the second limitation is that iProt-Sub only used the SVR algorithm to build the probabilistic cleavage site prediction models. the fourth limitation is that most of the substrate cleavage sites used for training the prediction models of iProt-Sub were identified by high-throughput mass spectrometry methods. iProt-Sub models trained using different encoding schemes and their combinations for cleavage site prediction of eight proteases on the 5-fold cross-validation test. the \u2018mRMR-FS\u2019 model achieved the overall best performance, after the two-step feature selection, compared with the other models for the MMP cleavage site prediction. the CKSAAP model only achieved an AUC of 0.502 and 0.581 for the cleavage site predictions of MMP-2 and MMP-3, respectively, compared with that of 0.914 and 0.922 for the cleavage site prediction of caspase-3 and caspase-7, respectively. future studies should investigate incorporation of other relevant features that might prove useful for improving the predictive performance of cleavage sites. sequence logos in Figure 3 show conserved sequence motifs or distinctive sequence patterns surrounding protease-specific substrate cleavage sites. a predominant characteristic of substrate cleavage sites of caspases is the requirement of Asp residue at the P1 position. for certain caspases, there is also a lesser selectivity for Asp residue at the P4 position, thereby constituting the canonical DXXD motif. mRMR algorithm combines mRMR algorithm with FFS to characterize a subset of optimal features that contributed the most to the prediction of substrate cleavage sites of each protease. the feature selection curve describes the performance change (in terms of AUC) as a function of the number of gradually increased OFCs. feature types are KNN features with a contribution percentage ranging from 6.67% (for caspase-8) to 98.55% (for caspase-7), AAC features with a contribution percentage ranging from 1.45% (for caspase-7) to 54.54% (for caspase-6), and BINARY features with a contribution percentage ranging from 1.45% (for caspase-7) performance comparison between iProt-Sub and other general prediction tools. we performed an independent test and compared the performance of iProt-Sub with three state-of-the-art tools that can be used to predict substrate cleavage sites for multiple proteases.
