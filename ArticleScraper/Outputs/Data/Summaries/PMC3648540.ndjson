{"summary": "BUNV is the type species of both the family Bunyaviridae and the genus Orthobunyavirus. BUNV itself is of low pathogenicity ([1]) but the recent outbreak of Schmallenberg orthobunyavirus in Europe ([2]) underscores the pathogenic potential of the orthobunyaviruses and the economic damage they can cause. proteins are targeted for proteasomal degradation by covalent attachment of multiple ubiquitin molecules (ubiquitylation) at lysine residues. the three-step ubiquitylation reaction involves the E1 activating enzyme, an E2 conjugating enzyme and an E3 ligase complex. viruses have evolved mechanisms either to block these signals or to subvert the UPS to cause degradation of anti-viral factors. degradation of NSs is proteasome-mediated and lysine-dependent. NSs protein levels increased up to 12hpi and then decreased to below detection limits by 24hpi. NSs protein levels reached a plateau from approximately 12hpi. cells were mock-infected with wtBUNV, rBUN4KR, or rBUN-K1, -K2, -K3 and -K4. m = mock-infected; wt = wtBUNV; 4KR = rBUN4KR. mutant virus called rBUN4KR and mutant protein NSs4KR. four recombinant mutant viruses were created in which the four arginine residues in rBUN4KR were individually mutated back to lysine. the NSs protein containing a lysine residue at position 49 (rBUN-K3) was only partially degraded after 24 hours, indicative of slower processing. this would agree with structure predictions that place this lysine residue in a less solvent-accessible position in the protein. NEDD8-activating enzyme (NAE) can be blocked by using the inhibitor MLN4924 ([37]). however, treating BUNV-infected cells with MLN4924 did not stabilise NSs. this excluded the possibility that NSs degradation is mediated by the Med8-containing E3 ligase. ubiquitylation assays failed to show the generation of any higher molecular weight species of NSs. in vivo ubiquitylation was investigated using an A549-derived cell line expressing 6His-tagged ubiquitin, A549-6His-Ub. the presence of ubiquitylated NSs was investigated by passing cell lysates over Ni2+-resin. anti-NSs antibody of lysates of infected BHK, A549, or A549-6His-Ub cells. degradation of NSs was found to be dependent on an active UPS. but it was not possible to confirm ubiquitylation of NSs directly. 4KR or a nonrelated protein (GFP) were added to a minireplicon assay expressing the viral minigenome (expressing Renilla luciferase), viral polymerase and nucleoprotein. values represent Renilla luciferase activity over firefly luciferase activity, normalised to the control reaction. wtBUNV, rBUNdelNSs2 and rBUN4KR viruses were serially wtBUNV, rBUN4KR and rBUNdelNSs2 were serially passaged in BHK cells. after 8 passages the RNA was extracted from pelleted virions. rBUN4KR and rBUNdelNSs2 had accumulated relatively larger amounts of DI RNAs than wtBUNV. the relative levels of full-length L segment of these viruses were below the detection limit. rBUN4KR and rBUNdelNSs2 viruses grew to titres in range 106\u2013107 PFU/ml at P9/P8. despite the presence of large amounts of DI RNAs at P8/P7 all viruses grew to titres in the range 106\u2013107 PFU/ml at P9/P8. increased and prolonged presence of NSs in rBUN4KR conferred a growth advantage in IFN competent cells. at this temperature, rBUN4KR and wtBUNV displayed similar growth characteristics in both BHK and A549 cells. poly(IC) treatment and rBUNdelNSs infection induced about twice as much IFN at 37\u00b0C as at 33\u00b0C. but virus infection appeared to be a much stronger inducer than the dsRNA analogue. when cells were infected with either wtBUNV or rBUN4KR, no IFN could be detected in the supernatant. Strain 129 mice were infected with 1000 PFU of wtBUNV or rBUN4KR virus. the mice were monitored twice daily and sacrificed when moribund. mutations in rBUN4KR that prevented degradation of NSs did not seem to affect replication in a negative way in mammalian cells or in mice. both viruses produced easily detectable levels of N protein by 24 hpi. detection of NSs protein by WB was more difficult in mosquito cells. NSs protein levels peaked at 24 hpi, and were barely detectable by 76 hpi. high-multiplicity infection of BHK cells with wtBUNV, NSs protein levels increased up to 12hpi and then decreased to below detection limits by 24hpi. NSs protein levels reached a plateau from approximately 12hpi. treatment with proteasome inhibitor MG132 prevented degradation. this led to considerable accumulation of NSs to similar extent as with MG132 treatment. cells were mock-infected or infected with wtBUNV, rBUN4KR, or rBUN-K1, -K2, -K3 and -K4. m = mock-infected; wt = wtBUNV; 4KR = rBUN4KR. proteasomal protein degradation is regulated through ubiquitylation of the substrate at lysine residues. the NSs protein containing a lysine residue at position 49 (rBUN-K3) was only partially degraded after 24 hours, indicative of slower processing. this would agree with structure predictions that place this lysine residue in a less solvent-accessible position in the protein and thus less available for modification. MG132 treated BUNV-infected cells with MLN4924 did not stabilise NSs. this excluded the possibility that NS degradation is mediated by the Med8-containing E3 ligase. cells were infected at 5 PFU/cell and harvested at the indicated times post infection. in vitro ubiquitylation assays failed to show the generation of any higher molecular weight species of NSs. in vivo ubiquitylation was investigated using an A549-derived cell line expressing 6His-tagged ubiquitin, A549-6His-Ub. the presence of ubiquitylated NSs was investigated by passing cell lysates over Ni2+-resin, but no bound NSs was detected. mutant NSs4KR mutations on known functions of NSs. rBUNdelNSs2 was shown to be a potent inducer of programmed cell death. infected cells showed some degree of DNA laddering compared to mock-infected cells. wtBUNV, rBUNdelNSs2 and rBUN4KR viruses were serially passaged at a fixed volume in BHK cells. virions from the virus stock (P0) and passage 8 (P8; or P7 for rBUNdelNSs2) were pelleted and their extracted RNA was analysed by Northern blotting. rBUNdelNSs2 and rBUNdelNSs2 were serially passaged in BHK cells. the RNA was extracted from pelleted virions and analysed with an L segment-specific probe. rBUN4KR and rBUNdelNSs2 viruses had acquired smaller L-segment-derived RNA species. despite the presence of large amounts of DI RNAs at P8/P7 all viruses grew to titres in the range 106\u2013107 PFU/ml at P9/P8. rBUNdelNS2 had retained its K-to-R mutations and no mutations were found in the wtBUNV S segment. wtBUNV and rBUN4KR showed similar growth characteristics in both cells. multicycle growth kinetics of wtBUNV and rBUN4KR were compared. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C. virus infection appeared to be a much stronger inducer than the dsRNA analogue. when cells were infected with either wtBUNV or rBUN4KR, no IFN could be detected in the supernatant. so, while wtBUNV was capable of overcoming the IFN response at either temperature, this appeared to come at a slight fitness cost at 37\u00b0C. rBUN4KR grew with equal efficiency at both temperatures. aedes albopictus-derived C6/36 and U4.4 cells were infected with wtBUNV or rBUN4KR at 0.01 PFU/cell. lysine residues in NSs may be important for some aspect of the virus replication cycle in mosquito cells. detection of NSs protein by WB was more difficult in mosquito cells. NSs protein levels peaked at 24 hpi, and were barely detectable by 76 hpi. NSs4KR protein seemed to peak at the same time during infection, but at lower levels than wt NSs. successful detection of NSs by Western blotting depends on the multiplicity of infection and the time post infection that the samples are taken. the levels of viral proteins appeared to be overall lower in A549 cells than in BHK cells. it would be expected that proteasome inhibition would lead to detection on Western blots of higher molecular-weight species corresponding to ubiquitylated NSs. however, these have not been observed. treatment of infected cells with MLN4924 did not stabilise NSs. the proteasome inhibitors MG132, epoxomicin and PYR-41 were added at 5\u20138 hpi. when added from the start of infection, the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the E1 inhibitor PYR-41 significantly delayed onset of N protein production. this is an indication that BUNV requires an active UPS during the early stages of infection mutant virus with stabilised NSs had a slight growth advantage over wt virus at 37\u00b0C. arginine substitutions did not impair the interferon antagonist function of NSs. in mice, both viruses were equally virulent, killing the mice in 4\u20136 days. the levels of NSs4KR expressed during infection were significantly lower than those of wt NSs. the levels of mRNA produced by the two viruses were similar. the only difference between the S segment-derived mRNAs is the four nucleotides in the middle of the coding region that change the four lysine residues to arginines. lysine mutations did not appear to affect the assayable functions of NSs in mammalian cells. further studies are in progress to determine whether rBUN4KR shows any phenotype in live mosquitoes. further studies are in progress to determine whether rBUN4KR shows any phenotype in live mosquitoes. stocks of wtBUNV, rBUNdelNSs2 and rBUNNSs4KR were prepared as described earlier. recombinant viruses expressing single-lysine mutants of NSs, rBUNK1, rBUNK2, rBUNK3 and rBUNK4 were not plaque-purified. a similar procedure was used to generate the related plasmids expressing NSs-K1 (primers ivk86 and ivk87), -K2 (primers ivk88 and ivk89), -K3 (primers ivk90 and ivk91) and -K4 (primers ivk92 and ivk93) constructs. Virus rescue Viruses were rescued as described before. 60 mm dishes of subconfluent BSR-T7/5 cells were transfected. transfected cells were incubated at 33\u00b0C until CPE was observed. for growth curves the supernatants were harvested, clarified by centrifugation at 500g for 5 min, and stored at 80\u00b0C before titration by plaque assay. the medium on the cells was replaced at 5\u20136 hpi by medium containing 10 M MG132 (Calbiochem) or 200 nM Epoxomicin (Sigma) ilutions of the medium were applied to fresh A549-NPro cells for 24 h. cells were fixed with formaldehyde and stained with Giemsa stain to monitor development of CPE. the relative IFN units (RIU) are expressed as 2N. pTM1-derived plasmids were transfected with NSs, NSs4KR, or GFP as a negative control. the total amount of DNA transfected was kept constant by the addition of empty TM1 vector. values were normalised to the control reaction where no NSs protein was expressed. iAmp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen) yields varied considerably but were not directly related to the level of signal of the viral RNA segments. the amount of RNA to be loaded on the gel was determined empirically and ranged from 0.8 to 3.8 g per lane. the RNA was separated by electrophoresis on a 1.5% agarose/TAE gel, followed by capillary transfer in 10xSSC to a positively charged nylon membrane. old mice were anaesthitised and inoculated intracranially with 20 l PBS containing 1103 PFU wtBUNV or rBUN4KR virus. cells and viruses Vero-E6, BHK, BSR-T7/5 ([45]; kindly provided by K.

Randall) pTM1-NSs and pT7ribo-BUNS(+) were mutated to change the 4 lysine residues in NSs to arginine residues by Quickchange PCR mutagenesis to create the 4KR versions. the plasmids were amplified using KOD polymerase (Novagen) and primers ivk69 and ivk70. ivk01 S-Fw mut 1\u201346* AGTAGTGTACTCCACCTAAAACTTATGCTATTGTTG ivk02 S-Rv mut 936\u2013912* CAGTTCTCGAGCATCAAATAATATAATGTTGTG ivk20 NSs-start Fw 104\u2013126* GGGAAACGTCTCaCATGATGTCGCTGCTAACACCAG ivk55 3\u2032UTR Rv 892 ACC ivk93 K4-R 278\u2013250 GGTTAAGTGTAACtTCTC * primers with internal mismatch or 5\u2032 tail that did not interfere with PCR amplification. transfected cells were incubated at 33\u00b0C until CPE was observed. the NEDD8 E1 activating enzyme inhibitor MLN4924 was used at 50 M and added at 5\u20136 hpi. plaque assay The plaque phenotype of viruses and the titres of growth curve and passaging assay samples were determined by plaque assay. atant was harvested when clear signs of CPE were observed. new flasks were infected with a fixed volume of 0.3 ml virus per flask. the supernatants were collected, clarified, and stored at 80\u00b0C. Western blotting (WB) Detection of proteins by Western blotting was performed as described previously ([44]) for RNA analysis of passaged viruses, the virions were pelleted from 1 ml of supernatant by centrifugation in a benchtop microfuge at 20,000g for 1.5 h at 4\u00b0C. the pellets were resuspended in 140 l of PBS. cDNA to the S segment was synthesised using MMLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) with primer ivk01, followed by PCR amplification using KOD polymerase (Novagen) with primers ivk01+ ivk55 and ivk02+ ivk20. mice were monitored twice daily for up to two weeks and euthanized when showing 4 or more of the predefined moderate severity signs."}
