{"summary": "colorectal cancer is the second and third most prevalent cancer among males and females in the united states. the 1-year and 5-year relative survival rates for patients suffering from colorectal cancer are 83.2% and 64.3%, respectively. development of resistance to chemotherapy also represents a critical issue for which simultaneous treatment with various classes of therapeutics has yielded some success. metal complexes have been extensively used in clinics for centuries. they have attracted numerous inorganic chemists to analyze them. copper is an essential trace element with an oxidative nature and bioessential activity in human metabolism. cancer cells and CCD 841 normal human colon epithelial cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) the cells were plated at a fitting density in tissue culture flasks (Corning, USA) according to each experimental scale, cell viability was measured by a conventional MTT reduction assay. HT-29 cells (5 104 cells/mL in a 25 mL culture flask) were plated, treated with Cu(BrHAP)2 (2 g/mL) or DMSO (negative control) for 24 h. the live cells were incubated with BrdU and Phospho-Histone H3 dyes for 30 min. HT-29 cells (5 104 cells/mL) were treated with Cu(BrHAP)2 for 24 h. after incubation, cells were spun down at 1800 rpm for 5 min. then fixation of a cell population for flow cytometry analysis was carried out to restore integrity. fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 538 nm every 2 min for 2 h. HT-29 cells (1 104 cells/mL) were seeded overnight in white-walled 96-well plates and treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP)2 and DMSO (negative control) for 24 h. the active caspases from apoptotic cells caused the cleavage of aminoluciferin-labeled synthetic tetrapeptide. the active caspases from apoptotic cells caused the release of substrate for the luciferase enzyme. HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP)2 for 3 h. solutions of tested compounds were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and stored at 20\u00b0C, protected from the light. HT-29 human colon cancer cells and CCD 841 normal human colon epithelial cells were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA) HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP)2 and Triton X-100 (positive control) for 48 h. the supernatants of the untreated and treated cells were transferred to a new 96-well plate for LDH activity analysis. HT-29 cells (1 104 cells/well in 96-well plate) were supplemented with Cu(BrHAP)2 (2 g/mL) or DMSO (negative control) for 24 h. the live cells were then incubated with BrdU and Phospho-Histone H3 dyes for 30 min. the experiment was performed in a black 96-well microplate with 25 L of compound, blank (solvent/PBS), standard (trolox), or positive control (quercetin) the plate was supplemented with the working fluorescein solution (150 L), followed by a 5 min incubation at 37\u00b0. fluorescence intensity was measured at an excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wavelength of 538 nm every 2 min for 2 h. HT-29 cells (1.0 104 cells/well) were seeded overnight in white-walled 96-well plates and treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP)2 for 24 h. the active caspases from apoptotic cells caused the cleavage of aminoluciferin-labeled synthetic tetrapeptide. the results were presented as the mean standard deviation (SD) of the number of experiments shown in the legends. an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was carried out using the prism statistical package. -29 cells treated with Cu(BrHAP)2 compound for 48 h showed cytotoxicity at 6.25 and 12.5 g/mL concentrations compared to the control cells. the results showed that the Cu(BrHAP)2 compound induced morphological features of apoptosis. chromatin condensation was observed after 72 h of treatment with Cu(BrHAP)2. cu(BrHAP)2 treatment caused no cell cycle arrest at the S/M phases. HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP)2 for 24 h and stained with DHE dye to determine the influence of the Schiff base compound on ROS production. HT-29 cells were incubated with DMSO or Cu(BrHAP)2 for 24 h. nuclear condensation emerged in some cells after treatment with Cu(BrHAP)2. permeability of treated cells was also elevated. me c release and a marked reduction in mitochondrial membrane potential. elevation in ROS production associated with a collapse in MMP may lead to the activation of the caspase cascade. ated NF-B in HT-29 treated cells, and TNF--stimulation led to NF-B translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. cu(BrHAP)2 treatment caused no changes in TNF-induced NF-B translocation in HT-29 cells. cytotoxicity of Cu(BrHAP)2 was tested on HT-29 and CCD 841 cell lines. the cytotoxicity of the Cu(BrHAP)2 compound was quantified on HT-29 cells treated with various concentrations of the Schiff base compound for 48 h. the results showed that the Cu(BrHAP)2 compound induced morphological features of. untreated HT-29 cells showed normal structure without prominent apoptosis or necrosis. early apoptosis features, including blebbing and chromatin condensation, were observed after 72 h of treatment with Cu(BrHAP)2. the lack of cell cycle arrest in the S/M phases suggested possible cell cycle arrest in the G1/G2 phases. HT-29 cells were treated with different concentrations of Cu(BrHAP)2 for 24 h. the fluorescence intensities of DHE oxidization by ROS were quantified using a fluorescence microplate reader. exposure to the Schiff base compound caused a significant elevation in the ROS levels of treated HT-29 cells at the 6.25 g/mL concentration. Cu(BrHAP)2 induced a noteworthy elevation in membrane permeability and cytochrome c release. increased cell permeability reduced MMP and increased cytochrome c release in treated HT-29 cells. elevation in ROS production associated with a collapse in MMP may lead to the activation of caspase cascade. cu(BrHAP)2 Schiff base compound did not exhibit any inhibitory effect on translocation of TNF-stimulated NF-B in HT-29 treated cells. TNF-stimulation led to NF-B translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. discussion Carcinogenesis is a multistage process in which unregulated cell proliferation and a reduction in apoptosis incidence serves as initial characterization for its progression. HT-29 cells have recently been characterized as a suitable model for colon cancer studies. the Cu(II) complex used in this study exhibited significant inhibition of HT-29 cell growth. the nontumorigenic colon cell line (CCD 841) showed no cytotoxicity after treatment with the compound. cell cycle results from the BrdU and Phospho-Histone H3 double staining assay indicated no significant changes in the number of cells in the S/M phases. the results showed significant cell cycle arrest at G1 after 24 and 48 h of treatment, suggesting proliferative suppression via induction of apoptosis. mitochondria have the crucial role in mediating apoptosis through metal-induced ROS. the intrinsic or mitochondrial-dependent signaling pathway involves different factors of nonreceptor-mediated stimuli that act on the mitochondrial-initiated events. these signals act on the mitochondrial-initiated events. excessive ROS production is a negative signal that can result in the failure of suppression of antiapoptotic factors. extrinsic pathway, apoptosis is mediated by death receptors. caspase-8 activation cleaves and activates downstream executioner caspases. there was no activation of caspase-8, suggesting that the apoptosis induced in HT-29 cells was mediated via the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway."}
