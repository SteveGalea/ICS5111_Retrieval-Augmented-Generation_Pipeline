{"summary": "our objective was to evaluate the effects of these infections on general health and reproduction parameters measurable on herd level. a pooled milk sample from five primiparous cows from 79 Swedish dairy herds in September 2006 was analysed for immunoglobulin G antibodies to BCV and BRSV. negative herds had a higher BMSCC compared with negative herds. bovine corona virus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) are two worldwide distributed viruses. BRSV causes diarrhoea in calves, winter dysentery in adults and various degrees of respiratory symptoms. BRSV is regarded as one of the most important causes of respiratory tract disease, especially in young calves. studies have been carried out to determine the relationship between herd health, reproduction efficiency and milk production and seropositivity to other viruses, for example bovine viral diarrhoea virus and bovine leukemia virus. we used 10-ml test tubes containing 1.5 mg of the preservative agent Bronopol. the milk samples were stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis. the same batch was used for all analyses. early and late calf mortality was calculated as the mean of 12 monthly IR; each monthly IR was calculated as number of calves dead at birth or within 24 hours divided by number of calvings. incidence of UDS 6 was calculated as a daily mean, i.e. number of cases with UDS 6 divided by number of cow days. t-test used to compare breed and AI strategy between NEG and POS herds. results variables mastitis, treatment for fertility problems, number of calves dead between one day and three months and diseases in young stock had more than 10% missing values. the natural logarithmic scale (ln) was transformed by taking the square root before analysis. the predictor variables were tested for collinearity by pair-wise Spearman rank correlation test. a test result of 0.6 was considered negative i.e. no strong correlation. pol (2-bromo-2-nitropropane-1.3-diol) milk samples were stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis. antibody detection and cut off The samples were not diluted or centrifuged. early and late calf mortality was calculated as the mean of 12 monthly IR. each monthly IR was calculated as number of calves dead at birth or within 24 hours divided by number of calvings. incidence of UDS 6 was calculated as a daily mean, i.e. number of cases with UDS 6 divided by number of cow days. data type Explanatory variables1 Milk yield Continuous Linear a, b, n BTMSCC2 Continuous Linear a, b, n, p, i Calving interval Continuous Linear a, b, n, p, i Number of AI3 Continuous Linear a, b, n, p, i Dead calves 0-24 hours Binomial Logistica, b, n Culling Binomial Logistica, b a test result of 0.6 was considered negative i.e. no strong correlation. there were no collinearities found between the explanatory variables. of 79 Swedish dairy herds, stratified by antibody-status to bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) as measured by an ELISA test in pooled milk samples of 5 primiparous cows sampled in September-October 2006. no other significant (P > 0.05) differences were found between NEG and POS herds. BRSV or BCV or both, measured by an ELISA test in pooled milk samples from five home-bred primiparous cows, collected in September-October 2006. the proportion of antibody positive herds did not differ significantly between the two areas under study for both BCV and BRSV. 79 Swedish dairy herds stratified by antibody-status to bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) as measured by an ELISA test in pooled milk samples of 5 primiparous cows sampled in September-October 2006. 104 Number of AI2 1.7 1.5-2.3 1.8 1.6-2 Dead calves3 0-24 h 0.040 0.033-0.052 0.047 0.028-0.093 Culling3 0.26 0.23-0.39 0.36 0.26-0.42 UDS3,4 6 1.3 0.97-1.4 1.7 1.2-2.3 Comparison between 10 Swedish dairy herds antibody negative (NEG) to bovine coronavirus (BCV) and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BR despite the difficulties to evaluate causality in cross-sectional studies, the medians for all analysed variables were consistently in favour of the NEG herds. one explanation for the lower BMSCC in NEG herds may be that an outbreak of BCV or BRSV increases the susceptibility to clinical or subclinical udder infections. a typical 50-cow AIT herd in study area 1 and 2 has two AI-technician visits per week. each AI-technician in these areas visits approximately six herds per day. an explanation could be that technicians educate the farmers continuously in how to protect their herd against contagious diseases. well managed herds with high biosecurity are also better in reporting. it is possible that well managed herds with high biosecurity are also better in reporting. this study was supported by the Swedish Farmers' Foundation for Agricultural Research."}
