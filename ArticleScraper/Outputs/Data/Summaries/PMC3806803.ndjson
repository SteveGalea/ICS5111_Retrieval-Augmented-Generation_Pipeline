{"summary": "antigenic properties are used to classify HA and NA of influenza strains into subtypes (HA: H1-17 and NA: N1-9) with some strains posing enormous threats to human health. despite improved vaccination efforts and better treatments, seasonal influenza is still responsible for more than 250,000 deaths per year worldwide. in all cases, HA is synthesized as a precursor (HA0), which is then cleaved to form a non-covalent complex. HA undergoes a series of binding and pH-induced conformational changes that result in binding of the virus to the plasma membrane, entry of the virus into the endosome, exposure of the HA fusion peptide fusion, and finally release of the viral RNA into the cytoplasm [1]. the recombinant HAs are full length, prepared in cell culture, and glycosylated. TBHQ was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and monoclonal antibody F49 was obtained from Takara Bio (Mountain View, CA) with 1% penicillin-streptomycin, the pseudovirions were seeded to 2104 cells/well of a 24 well cell culture plate in a volume of 0.5 mL. after approximately 3\u20135 hours, the virus was aspirated and replaced with A549 medium. the cells were allowed to rest for another 40 hours. protein 1H were saturated with a train of 50 msec pulses at 100 Hz power for 1 sec with \u201con\u201d resonance saturation at 1 ppm and \u201coff\u201d resonance saturation at 30 ppm. spectra were processed by NMRPipe with a 5 Hz line broadening function and analyzed by NMRDraw. TBHQ was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) and monoclonal antibody F49 was obtained from Takara Bio (Mountain View, CA) the inhibitory properties of TBHQ were tested in a pseudovirus entry assay. pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- and pNL4-3.Luc.R-E- were co-transfected into 293T cells. the medium was harvested and filtered through a 0.45 micron filter. the following day, 500 L of the virus stock was added to each of the wells. periments NMR experiments were performed on a Bruker 900 MHz AVANCE spectrometer equipped with a cryogenic triple resonance probe. experimental conditions were 0.5 M HA and 50\u2013100 M TBHQ in 20 mM PO4/pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl in 90% 1H2O, 10% 2H2O (WaterLOGSY) or 100% 2H2O (STD) at 25\u00b0C in 3 mm NMR tubes. 10 M H7 HA was pre-incubated in the presence of 330 M TBHQ for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the buffered solution was then incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the buffered solution was then incubated with 2 g of trypsin for 30 min. we first tested the inhibitory properties of TBHQ using pseudovirions containing H3 HA. TBHQ inhibits H3 HA-mediated entry with an IC507 M (purple triangles) this is in accordance with the previously reported IC50 for inhibition of H3 influenza infection. TBHQ binds to the stem loop of H3 HA by x-ray crystallography [23]. TBHQ was shown to bind to the stem loop of H3 HA by x-ray crystallography [23]. the addition of monoclonal antibody F49 significantly decreases binding of TBHQ. TBHQ binds to the H3 and H7 HA stem loops. waterLOGSY NMR of TBHQ binding to H3 HA in the presence of monoclonal antibody F49. TBHQ stabilizes the neutral pH conformation of H7 HA. the curves correspond to fits using [H+]mp = 1.30105 and n = 1.6 in the absence of TBHQ and [H+]mp = 2.83105 and n = 1.8 in the presence of TBHQ. TBHQ inhibits the entry of H3 and H7 HA. TBHQ inhibits H7 HA-mediated entry with an IC506 M (black squares) the toxicity of TBHQ was determined to be CC50>100 M. TBHQ Binds to the Stem Loops of H3 and H7 HA WaterLOGSY NMR has previously been shown to be useful for the detection of small molecule interactions. TBHQ binds to the H3 and H7 HA stem loops. the tert-butyl methyl 1H exhibit significantly less STD intensity. TBHQ binds to the H3 and H7 HA stem loops. TBHQ Stabilizes the Neutral pH Conformation of H3 and H7 HA. the low pH of the endosome triggers a large, irreversible conformational change in HA, which is necessary for membrane fusion. the curves correspond to fits using [H+]mp = 1.30105 and n = 1.6 in the absence of TBHQ and [H+]mp = 2.83105 and n = 1.8 in the presence of TBHQ. TBHQ acts by stabilizing the neutral pH conformation, thereby delaying conformational changes necessary for fusion of the virus and endosome membranes."}
