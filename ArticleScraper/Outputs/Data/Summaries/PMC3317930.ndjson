{"summary": "dengue virus is a flavivirus with four related but antigenically distinct serotypes (DENV1-4) it infects approximately 50\u2013100 million people each year, of which 500,000 people exhibit the life-threatening form of severe dengue \u2013 dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) the current lack of treatment or licensed vaccine means dengue poses a serious public health threat [2]. the four serotypes of DENV were sequentially screened with a non-immunized human Fab phage display library. the Fab with highest affinity, D29 Fab-IgG, was converted into full-length human IgG1 format for thorough characterization. the antibody cross-reacted with E protein \u2013 fine mapping and site-directed mutagenesis studies localized the epitope to the DI/DII junction of E. this suggests the possibility that strategies HEK293 T cells (ATCC) was cultured in modified Eagle\u2019s medium (DMEM) (GIBCO, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37oC in 5% CO2. antibodies and Proteins Mouse monoclonal antibodies 3H5 (m3H5), 4G2 (m4G2) and 2H2 (m2H2) are specific to EDIII of DENV2, EDII of flaviviruses and prM Virus titer was determined as genome containing particles (GCP)/ml. direct binding ELISA was performed using standard ELISA methods. results were fitted to a one-site binding hyperbola using Prism 5.03. cells were mounted with MOWIOL (Sigma) and images were captured using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus) preparation of dengue lysate and Western Blot deNV-infected Vero cells were harvested 5 days post-infection. an equal volume of 5 loading dye was added to the cell lysate before 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. m4G2 or m2H2 for 1 hr at RT before applying to blocked membranes for 30 min at RT. anti-Human IgG-Fc secondary antibody was applied to detect bound D29 for 45 min at RT after 4 washes with PBST. lysate from infected cells was incubated with 1.25% SDS for 30 min at 4oC. inhibition ELISA was carried out to test whether isolated peptide phage inhibits binding of D29 to its natural epitope. 10-fold serially diluted peptide phage (starting at 1012 pfu/ml) or 2105 pfu DENV2 was incubated with D29 Fab-IgG for 1 hr before applying to deNV2-coated plate for 5 min. amino acids residues of predicted epitopes, P3 and P9, were mutated by site-directed mutagenesis using Quikchange Multi Site-directed Mutagenesis kit. PCR reactions and subsequent cloning steps were carried out according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. HEK293 T cells (ATCC) were grown in 199 medium (M199) (GIBCO, Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% FBS at 37oC in 5% CO2. antibodies and Proteins Mouse monoclonal antibodies 3H5 (m3H5), 4G2 (m4G2) and 2H2 (m2H2) are specific to EDIII of DENV2, EDII of flaviviruses and prM of DENV Virus titer was determined as genome containing particles (GCP)/ml. direct binding ELISA against dengue virus was performed using standard ELISA methods. cells were mounted with MOWIOL (Sigma) and images were captured using a fluorescent microscope (Olympus) preparation of dengue lysate and Western Blot deNV-infected Vero cells were harvested 5 days post-infection. an equal volume of 5 loading dye was added to the cell lysate before 12% SDS-PAGE and transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes. Fab-IgG D29 was incubated with m3H5, m4G2 or m2H2 for 1 hr at RT. antibody was applied to blocked membranes for 30 min at RT. lysate from infected cells was incubated with 1.25% SDS for 30 min at 4oC. inhibition ELISA was carried out using MSI WebLab ViewLite (Accelrys) to test whether isolated peptide phage inhibits binding of D29 to its natural epitope. PCR reactions and subsequent cloning steps were carried out according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. Mutants were expressed in HEK293-T cells and harvested 48 hr post-transfection for immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitation experiments. ADE assay performed as described previously [20]. D29 Fab-IgG reacted with infected cells from DENV1-4 without cross-reaction to the non-infected cell controls. binding specificity and affinity of D29 Fab-IgG was detected by anti-human-IgG-FITC. the amino acid sequence of its CDRs was found to have little deviation from germline. however, the amino acid sequence of its CDRs was found to have little deviation from germline. this suggests that antibodies like D29 can be generated in the early immune response against DENV. serially diluted h3H5, h4G2 or m2H2 was incubated with immobilized DENV2 (2107 pfu/ml) for 1 hr at RT. 1.5 g/ml of HRP-conjugated m2H2 was used to compete against m2H2. h4G2 detected the 55 kDa E protein of all 4 serotypes. m2H2 detected the 20 kDa prM of all 4 serotypes. binding was abolished in the presence of reducing agent. dissociation of the heterodimer with 1.25% SDS was performed prior to the assay. identity of the precipitated proteins was verified by non-reducing Western blot analysis with h3H5 and m2H2 respectively. inhibition ELISA was carried out using synthetic 20 mer linear peptides covering DENV2 prM [25] and a library of short 15-mer overlapping linear peptides (Mimotope) none of the linear peptides were able to significantly inhibit the binding of D29 Fab-IgG to DENV2. clones were randomly selected from the second, third and fourth round of panning. nes selected Sequence Cluster P1 WSVKLPVWPINH 1 GWPGKLPLWNWD 1 P2 YKQPLWPNQISW 1 P4 KPADVGELGKLY 1 YKQPLWPNQISW 1 P8 AKTMPWDLLFLL 2 AKTMPGTYYSYW 2 P5 WTLKLPQWLNST 2 P6 NHQHKIPLWNSW 3 P7 KLPMWENWANYT 3 P7 es predicted by pepitope server are displayed on the prM-E heterodimer crystal structure at neutral pH. the binding specificity of peptide-phages to D29 Fab-IgG was tested in a direct ELISA format with 10 g/ml of D29 Fab-IgG. nine representative clones were selected (Table 1) and assessed for their ability to bind D29 Fab-IgG. no cross-reaction by these peptide-phage clones with control antibodies was observed. clone P3 (Cluster 1) and P9 (Cluster 2) significantly competed by 30% and 70%. two mutants, M1 (P56L-A, P58Q-G, P59N-G) and M2 (E246K-A, E247K-A) were generated. their reactivity with D29 Fab-IgG was tested by Western blot analysis. mutation at the prM residues in M1 was almost completely abolished. both control antibodies were able detect their respective protein targets for all mutants. binding of h4G2 to E of M4 also appeared to be affected. binding of h4G2 to E of M4 also appeared to be affected. antibody-dependent Neutralization and Enhancement Previous studies with anti-prM antibodies have shown that while the antibodies are generally non-neutralizing [9], [25], they are capable of rendering non-infectious immature DENV (imDENV) particles infectious through an FcR-mediated process. infection of virtually non-infectious imDENV was significantly enhanced by D29 Fab-IgG to a level similar to m2H2. enhancement of imDENV infection by h3H5 was similar to that observed for DENV2. h4G2 failed to enhance imDENV2 infection in K562 cells. Binding of D29 Fab-IgG was detected by anti-human-IgG-FITC. non-infected cells (CC) were included as control. competition ELISA used humanized versus parental murine antibodies for 3H5 and 4G2 and HRP-conjugated m2H2 versus non-conjugated for m2H2. no significant competition was observed between D29 Fab-IgG and m3H5, h4G2 or non-DENV specific control antibody. Western blot analysis carried out with deNV1-4 (D1-D4) infected Vero cell lysate and 0.5 g of recombinant DENV2 E protein (ecto-domain) (rE) separated on 12% SDS-PAGE in (B) non-reducing, (C) reducing conditions followed by detection with 1 g/ml of h3H5, h4G2, m2H2 and D29 Fab-IgG h3H5 and h4G2 did not compete with D29 Fab-IgG for epitopes in the Western blot format. incubation with m2H2 abolished binding to prM but not to E protein. immunoprecipitation was carried out with deNV2-infected BHK cell lysate. lysate of deNV2-infected BHK cells incubated with media supplemented with 250 Ci/ml 35S-methionine before lysis. precipitated prM and E proteins were verified by (anti-prM) HRP-conjugated m2H2 or (anti-E) h3H5 respectively. no linear peptides were able to significantly inhibit binding of D29 Fab-IgG to DENV2. clones were randomly selected from the second, third and fourth round of panning. binding specificity was confirmed by direct binding ELISA against D29 Fab-IgG. the peptides with the KXPXW motif could mostly be mapped to the highest scoring cluster 1 located at the prM/EDII interface. clusters of conformational epitopes predicted by Pepitope server are displayed on the prM-E heterodimer crystal structure at neutral pH. peptide-phages (1012 pfu/ml) were incubated with D29 Fab-IgG for 1 hr at RT. the percentage of inhibition of D29 Fab-IgG binding by the peptide-phages shown is the average of three experiments. clone P3 (Cluster 1) and P9 (Cluster 2) significantly competed by 30% and 70%. inhibition of binding to both prM and E was also observed on Western blot for P9. reactivity with D29 Fab-IgG was tested by Western blot analysis. all antibodies reacted with their respective protein targets for the prM-E protein. binding of m2H2 and m2H2 to the prM protein was almost completely abolished by mutation at the prM residues in M1. binding of D29 Fab-IgG to the E protein of M3, M5 and M6 mutants was severely affected. binding of prM for all these mutants was not affected at all. together these results confirm epitopes identified through peptide-phage display. the specific infectivity of the viruses was established by qPCR and plaque assay to be 8.5105:1 for imDENV2. serially diluted anti-DENV antibodies were incubated with (B) DENV2 or (C) imDENV2 at MOG 25 for 1 hr at 37oC before infection of 2104 cells for 2 days. h4G2 failed to enhance imDENV2 infection in K562 cells possibly be due to the occlusion of its epitope by the pr peptide [29], [30], and indicated by the immunoprecipitation protein profile. a cross-reactive antibody fragment \u2013 D29, from a non-immune human Fab-phage library shows near germline sequence. two peptide phage clones, P3 (Cluster 1) and P9 (Cluster 2), showed significant inhibition of D29 Fab-IgG binding to immobilized DENV2 by ELISA. P9 was also able to significantly block the binding of D29 Fab-IgG in a non-reducing Western blot analysis. predicted residues were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the predicted residues. most current dengue vaccines consist of both prM and E proteins [12], [13], [35]; studies performed with tick-borne encephalitis virus indicate proper folding of E requires the chaperone function of prM [36]. however, prM-specific antibodies are able to restore and enhance infectivity of imDENV and partially mature DENV. the amino acid sequence of D29 Fab-IgG was aligned with the germline sequence using the on-line program IgBlast. 10 g/ml of synthetic peptides corresponding to prM (A and E) was incubated with D29 Fab-IgG. u/ml of DENV2 or imDENV2 was included as control antigen. u/ml of deNV2 or imDENV2 was included as control antigen."}
