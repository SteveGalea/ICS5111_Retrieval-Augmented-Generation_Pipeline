{"summary": "extracellular protein-protein interactions (ePPIs) are key for information processing and coordination of virtually all processes in a living organism. despite these proteins being encoded by approximately one-fourth of the human genes, at least two-thirds of the existing drugs target either secreted or membrane-bound proteins. ePPIs are underrepresented in available large-scale datasets. pathogens have evolved a myriad of elegant and often complex strategies to invade the host and commandeer host immune responses. many cell surface molecules serve as entry receptors for initial host cell invasion, and concerted responses to the pathogenic challenge critically rely on cell functions mediated by receptors and secreted proteins. biochemical and biophysical approaches are particularly suitable for detection of high affinity host-pathogen interactions, such as those mediated by a viral capsid protein and a host cell surface receptor. immunoprecipitation and MS approaches fail to detect weak interactions, which often characterize ePPIs, particularly those that take place on the cell surface. the gHgLgO trimer is involved in the infection of fibroblasts. the gHgLUL128L pentameric complex is required for entry into endothelial, epithelial, and myeloid cells. both the trimeric and the pentameric CMV protein complexes were generated as recombinant products and used as baits to perform binding experiments. nal antibodies CD4 identified as the receptor for most rhinovirus serotypes. nal antibodies CD4 identified as the common entry receptor for most rhinovirus serotypes. cDNA libraries CD81, Claudin-1, and Occludin as cell surface binding partners. adenovirus and coxsackievirus B monoclonal antibodies and cDNA libraries CAR identified as a common entry receptor for adenovirus 2/5 and coxsackievirus B [40] Sindbis virus siRNA screens NRAMP as cell surface receptor for entry into Drosophila cells [41] Murine norovirus CRISPR/Cas9 CD300lf identified as a cell surface receptor that determines virus tropism [42] Bacterial bacterial protein Fap2 binds to receptor TIGIT and downregulates NK-mediated killing of tumor cells [52] AVEXIS, Avidity-based extracellular interaction screen; NAPPA, nucleic-acid programmable protein array; MPA, microfluidic-based comprehensive protein array; CRISPR clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat; MS, mass spectrometry; PPI, protein-protein interaction. ePPIs biophysical techniques have not been exploited for large-scale ePPI discovery. these approaches require previous knowledge of pathogen-encoded proteins responsible for binding and the ability to produce such proteins as recombinant reagents. however, alternative methods have been used in those cases where there is no previous knowledge of the pathogen proteins required for interaction with the host cells. protein microarrays offer the unique advantage of requiring minimal consumption of protein reagents, fast readouts, and relatively more affordable instrumentation. most existing microarray-based methodologies rely on multimerization of the bait protein for increased avidity and detection of weak ePPIs. AVEXIS has been used for medium-scale screens, allowing detection of weak interactions between human receptors with low false-positive rates. the authors compiled a library of most secreted or cell surface-expressed proteins in erythrocytes. AVEXIS was miniaturized making this approach compatible with the protein microarray format, thus permitting more comprehensive and lower resource-intensive screenings. ed in the generation of a comprehensive human protein library. secreted proteins or the ECD of single-transmembrane receptors were fused to different affinity tags. subsequently purified from cell culture supernatants by size-exclusion chromatography. adenovirus- (HAdV-) encoded immunomodulatory proteins show substantial diversity in their ECDs across and within viral species. despite increasing relevance of HAdV as both pathogens and therapeutic vectors, information on the interaction of these viruses with the host immune system remains scarce. the full-length protein (secreted proteins) or the ECD (transmembrane-containing proteins) is fused to a tag for subsequent expression in the heterologous system of choice followed by affinity purification. a multimerization strategy based on the coupling of Fc-tagged baits to fluorescent protein A microbeads is shown. unbiased, microarray-based study of immunomodulatory proteins represented the first large-scale analysis of the PPI landscape of a collection of extracellular immunomodulators encoded by viruses. y functions during the immune response (as defined by the presence of intracellular immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory motif, ITIM), including LILRB1 [81, 82], LAIR1 [83], and MPZL1 [84]. new data support the utility of NAPPA as a useful tool for the study of bacterial proteins. the authors used the bioinformatics approach to predict the Pseudomonas aeruginosa proteins that reside in the outer membrane of the bacteria or are secreted to the extracellular environment of the infected cell. bacterial proteins of interest were tagged with a HaloTag. a modified haloalkane dehalogenase covalently binds to synthetic Halo-ligands (haloalkanes) that can be fluorescently labeled. this allows more robust detection of bait protein binding to interactors. a library of 2,700 human genes encoding for membrane proteins was built and subsequently used to screen the large-form delta antigen (L-HDAg) encoded by the hepatitis delta virus (HDA) and whole viral particles of the simian virus 40 (SV40), a nonenveloped human pathogen. this is the first study to assess ePPIs using a comprehensive human protein library and whole viral particles (SV40) as baits. AVEXIS consists of the expression of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the bait of interest as a recombinant protein, which retains its binding properties while removing the insoluble transmembrane region of the protein. AVEXIS consists of the expression of the extracellular domain (ECD) of the bait of interest as a recombinant protein. AVEXIS was miniaturized making this approach compatible with the protein microarray format. this approach should allow for high throughout and sensitive determination of ePPIs. this approach has not yet been applied to elucidation of pathogen-host interactions. extracellular protein microarrays have successfully identified counterreceptors for a number of human molecules. adenovirus- (HAdV-) encoded immunomodulatory proteins show substantial diversity in their ECDs across and within viral species and constitute one of the most divergent regions of the HAdV genome [75, 76]. most of the E3 immunomodulators were identified as multifunctional proteins. this suggests that viruses have evolved proteins capable of interfering with several cellular functions. so far few examples of widespread targeting in the extracellular environment have been reported. unbiased, microarray-based study of immunomodulatory proteins represented first large-scale analysis of the PPI landscape of extracellular immunomodulators encoded by viruses. unbiased, microarray-based study of immunomodulatory proteins represented the first large-scale analysis of the PPI landscape. new data support the utility of NAPPA as a useful tool for the study of bacterial proteins. new data support the utility of the microarrays to detect immune responses against membrane proteins encoded by pathogens. several groups have developed microarrays composed of pathogen-encoded proteins. such arrays have so far been exploited mainly for diagnosis purposes. their inherent high throughput and compatibility with multivalent bait approaches makes them a powerful tool for ePPI discovery. this is the first study to assess ePPIs using a comprehensive human protein library. a library of 2,700 human genes encoding for membrane proteins was built and subsequently used to screen the large-form delta antigen (L-HDAg) encoded by the hepatitis delta virus and whole viral particles of the simian virus 40. this platform provides an extended version of the NAPPA approach that focuses on mammalian ePPIs. the protein microarrays have represented one of the most fruitful approaches for unbiased determination of ePPIs, including host-pathogen interactions. however, any discoveries made using these platforms are limited to the proteins present in each array. several studies have exploited MS-based techniques to gain insights into the extracellular protein composition of bacterial pathogens. the surface proteome of the tick-borne intracellular pathogen Anaplasma marginale contained a novel protein, which the authors hypothesized to play a function in human cell invasion. this suggests a remodeling of the bacteria surface proteome during the transition between mammalian and arthropod hosts. moonlighting is in line with the hypothesis that pathogens have evolved multifunctional proteins as a prominent strategy for efficient use of limited genomic resources. bacterial protein moonlighting is in line with the hypothesis that pathogens have evolved multifunctional proteins. TRICEPS is a chemoproteomic reagent that consists of three moieties. one that binds the ligand of interest through its amino groups. another that binds glycosylated receptors on the cell surface. biotin tag for purifying receptor peptides for subsequent identification by MS. Xia group analyzed 190 viral and bacterial pathogens. they found that pathogen-encoded proteins preferentially interfere with host molecules that control critical cellular processes, such as cell death or nuclear transportation. more extensive analyses encompassing other human viruses and bacterial pathogens may reveal general strategies of immunomodulation. bioinformatics analysis of virus-host interactions suggests virus-mediated targeting of host proteins is characterized by signatures of pleiotropy, economy, and convergent evolution. ePPIs amenable to therapeutic intervention may reveal novel ePPIs. characterization of extracellular proteins is constrained by the fact that commonly used prediction algorithms fail to correctly predict the location of several proteins. hypothesis suggests a remodeling of the bacteria surface proteome during the transition between mammalian and arthropod hosts. some studies have pursued the identification of the proteins present in viral particles utilizing MS. bacterial proteins, predicted cytoplasmic by consensus, can be found in the extracellular environment of the cell, where they may play alternative functions. bacterial protein moonlighting is in line with the hypothesis that pathogens have evolved multifunctional proteins as a prominent strategy for efficient use of limited genomic resources. bacterial protein moonlighting, excellently revisited by Henderson and Martin [111], is a thought-provoking phenomenon that suggests a much more complex extracellular landscape than anticipated. downregulation of five out of the seven candidates using short interfering RNA reduced VACV infection by 40\u201360%, supporting the functionality of the interactions identified, at least in vitro. bioinformatics offers an in silico systems biology approach that reveals a global perspective on host-pathogen interactions. bioinformatics analysis of virus-host interactions suggests virus-mediated targeting of host proteins is characterized by signatures of pleiotropy, economy, and convergent evolution. bioinformatics analysis of virus-host interactions highlights significant differences between virus-host and within-host interactions. cDNA libraries have proven extremely successful in identifying viral receptors through a gain-of-function approach, upon transduction of the cDNA library from a susceptible cell line into nonpermissive cell lines. the use of cDNA libraries is not reviewed in detail here in the interest of a more comprehensive revision of relative newer genomics-based approaches. RNAi screens have provided tremendous insights into host-pathogen interactions. inefficient gene depletion and off-target effects are important limitations of this methodology. high throughput CRISPR/Cas9 screens for genome-wide studies have already displayed remarkable results. sulfation and fucosylation of cell surface components were identified as host determinants of T3SS1- and T3SS2-mediated cytotoxicity. authors hypothesize that interactions between sulfated cell surface molecules act as facilitators of T3SS1 activity. fucosylated glycans on the surface may serve as receptors for T3SS2 components necessary for insertion of the complex. haploid cell line is derivative of chronic myeloid leukemia cell line (CML) with a haploid karyotype except for chromosome 8. gene-trap approach was successfully used to identify host factors essential for the functions of distending toxins or CDTs, potent virulence factors secreted by a number of pathogenic bacteria. authors propose novel mechanism of entry by which Ebola virus is internalized into the endocytic pathway. endosome fusion, mediated by the HOPS complex, would allow interaction with NCP1 containing endosomes. such redundancy in receptor usage likely explains why these receptors were not identified in the haploid cell screen [47] the authors elegantly demonstrated that at a neutral pH, the Lassa virus glycoprotein was bound to DAG1. upon exposure to lower pH, a receptor switch occurred leading to strong association with the lysosomal-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) [48]. this suggests the virus would be incorporated into the endocytic pathway after interaction with its surface receptor DAG1. a number of haploid cell lines have been generated in mammals. it will be important to generate additional haploid cell lines. this will broaden the range of pathogens and pathogen-derived molecules that can be studied using these genetic tools. the generation of phagemic and transposon library-based screenings has also represented an important tool for deciphering PPIs. pathogen-encoded molecules are expressed as fusions with phage envelope proteins, a method known as phage display that has been widely exploited to identify peptides with specific binding properties. the authors identified 19 genes with homology to known bacterial adhesin proteins, along with genes with uncharacterized functions. authors identified F. nucleatum as the bacterial protein that directly interacted with TIGIT. this led to inhibition of NK cytotoxicity and downregulation tumor-infiltrating T lymphocytes activation. transposon-based mutant libraries are readily available for other pathogenic bacteria. cDNA libraries have proven extremely successful in identifying viral receptors through a gain-of-function approach, upon transduction of the cDNA library from a susceptible cell line into nonpermissive cell lines. the use of cDNA libraries is not reviewed in the interest of a more comprehensive revision of relative newer genomics-based approaches.
