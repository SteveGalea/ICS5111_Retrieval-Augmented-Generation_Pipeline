{"summary": "a sudden outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) occurred in 2003. more public health emergencies such as the H1N1 flu epidemic in 2009 and the H7N9 avian flu epidemic in 2013 had serious impacts on China\u2019s politics, economy, trade, and people\u2019s health. the practice of the health emergency management assessment system should focus on the application of health supervision agencies, schools, and other institutions. the development of china\u2019s health emergency research has played an important role in promoting the development of global health emergency systems. research that only mentions the word \u201cindicators of health emergency assessment\u201d has no specific evaluation index content or only partial evaluation indicators. there is no valid content literature, or the original language is from non-Chinese literature.

Quality Evaluation Criteria The two reviewers independently screened the literature and conducted a literature quality evaluation. each evaluation indicator corresponds to a score; three \u201c*\u201ds indicate high quality research, two \u201c*\u201ds indicate medium quality research, and one \u201c*\u201d indicates low quality research performed. in the research field, there were 39

of public health emergency response in a province/autonomous region/municipality directly under the central government (National) health emergency assessment was conducted at all levels of government

referred to laws, regulations, systems, or other standards during the emergency assessment system construction process. one study (3.7%) on a social vulnerability assessment system for major infectious diseases. one study (3.7%) on an early warning system for influenza outbreaks. the types of assessments vary according to different classification criteria such as the purpose, the object, and the content of the assessment as well as the work status [10] research clearly indicates that there are a multitude of assessments in china. first, assessments are divided according to purpose, i.e., formative and summative assessments. health emergency management assessment is a process of formulating objective judgments on assessment targets based on specific criteria. the health emergency management evaluation system weight analysis and application falls more in the domain of the Delphi method, while analytic hierarchy process, entropy weight, rank sum ratio, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation. health emergency management assessment dimensions and indicators are complex. they represent a specific aspect of health emergency management work. these elements support health emergency management work and are the foundation for the smooth implementation. the main laws and regulations used in the process of constructing a health emergency assessment system included the Emergency Regulations for Public Health Emergencies, the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Emergency Response, the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Prevention and control of Infectious Diseases. the research in reference to laws, regulations, systems, or other standards is still marginal. there persists a lack of detailed studies on legal, regulatory, and policy bases for health emergency management assessment before the establishment of the National the types of application institutions are predominantly from disease prevention and control institutions, medical and health institutions, government and health administrative departments, and military and border ports. 4.7. Limitations and Strengths The study solely included Chinese research, and this arguably limits the ecological validity of the findings. a preliminary discussion on the early warning index system for influenza outbreaks, the construction of an evaluation index system for hospital nurses\u2019 public health emergency response capacity, and the evaluation of emergency drill activities in county-level disease control institutions in Nanchang City are examples of pre-assessment. social vulnerability assessments and analyses of significant factors associated with major infectious diseases are concerned with the assessment of the nature, the type, the extent, and the factors of public health emergencies. the health emergency management evaluation system weight analysis and application falls more in the domain of the Delphi method. analytic hierarchy process, entropy weight, rank sum ratio, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation, and matter-element extension methods are relatively new methods for health emergency assessment. in the future, more comprehensive, targeted, and operational public health events, social security incidents, natural disasters, and accident disasters related laws and regulations will likely be gradually developed. the study found that the main Chinese environmental laws and regulations utilized in the process of building a health emergency assessment system included the Emergency Regulations for Public Health Emergencies, the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on Emergency Response, the Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China on the Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases. study found that most research is narrowly focused on particular topics. but it is rare to explore the interrelationships and the causal paths among the various elements of the evaluation system. specific problems should be found in the health system, and relationships and mechanisms of system elements should undergo in-depth analysis. for more than ten years, the health emergency management assessment has prioritized the evaluation of staged and key management work. there is still a lack of research across all processes related to the health emergency management evaluation system. china should emphasize research and application of health emergency assessment in central and western regions. the dimensions of health emergency management assessment are also complicated. the evaluation indicators mainly include management ability, improvement ability, exercise ability, and reporting ability. the practical application of the health emergency management assessment system needs to be further explored and improved."}
