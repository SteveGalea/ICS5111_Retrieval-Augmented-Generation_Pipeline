{"summary": "influenza virus is a widespread respiratory pathogen in humans and other animals. infection is acute, peaking roughly on the third day of exposure. this leads to antigenic shift and antigenic drift, turning all attempts of vaccine and antiviral design into a never-ending battle. influenza is a self-limiting acute disease that lasts 7\u201310 days. common symptoms include high fever, headache, weakness, cough, sore throat, runny or stuffy nose, and body ache. influenza can also invite opportunistic pathogens, leading to secondary infections such as bacterial pneumonia. the influenza viruses are currently classified into three types: A, B, or C. neuraminidase (NA) and the M2 ion channel protein are the targets for the fda-approved influenza antiviral drugs. dicer products are commonly known as short interfering RNA or siRNA. the antisense strand of the siRNA is recruited into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) the key catalytic component of which is the \u201cslicer\u201d RNase, Argonaute 2 (Ago2). the RISC engages the complementary target mRNA, which is then sliced and destroyed by Ago2. the high mutability of RNA viral genomes in general and the reassortment of genome segments in segmented viruses have generated many strains and subtypes of influenza virus. the influenza A virus boasts 15 HA and nine NA subtypes. mRNA sequences target viral mRNAs [10] shown in Table 1. Validated siRNA sequences targeting influenza viral mRNAs [10] are shown in Table 1. small molecules that bind to the HIV coreceptors (CXCR4, CCR5) have shown promise as effective HIV antivirals [16]. throughput siRNA screening was performed in surrogate Drosophila cells [17] and then in human origin [18,19] to identify cellular genes needed for influenza virus growth. these studies revealed essential roles of dozens of cellular genes in influenza replication. some gene products may be partially dispensable, at least for a short term. knockout mice are fully viable and fertile, with virtually no phenotype. both proteins, as well as profilin, were found to be essential for the morphogenesis of respiratory syncytial virus. knockdown of VASP, Zyxin, or profilin by siRNA strongly inhibits progeny virus synthesis. siRNAs that strongly inhibited influenza virus production in cultured cells also inhibited virus production in chicken embryos [10,12,13,30] siRNA that show potency against influenza virus in cell culture is then tested in the mouse model. siRNAs were target-specific, did not activate interferon, and were effective in both prophylaxis and therapy. intranasal anti-influenza siRNA can match the virus in speed, tissue specificity, and broad-spectrum potency. the previously mentioned Zanamivir is applied via a hand-held nasal inhaler. but its side-effects may include exasperation of asthma, bronchospasm, coughing, dizziness, headache, nausea, sinus inflammation, sore throat, stuffy nose and facial swelling. in a recent study, a non-pairing uridine bulge in the \u2018passenger\u2019 strand was introduced in a siRNA against semliki forest virus (SFV) the modified siRNA resembled the micro-RNA (miRNA) family of short RNA, naturally found in normal cells. in another study, the residual part of the mRNA following siRNA-mediated cleavage was shown to translate shorter, N-terminal protein fragments. both approaches can be easily tested and adopted for influenza viral targets. there is significant optimism that an anti-influenza siRNA drug may be in clinical trial in short order."}
