{"summary": "rRNA degradation in pIC-transfected OAS1-KO and OAS2-KO cells was similar to that in pIC-transfected WT cells. cleavage of rRNA was restored by stable expression of Flag-tagged OAS3 in the OAS3-KO cells. OAS3-KO cells showed much higher levels of rRNA degradation at pIC concentrations as low as 250 ng/mL (RIN = 8.1) rRNA degradation was barely detectable in pIC-KO cells (at 20 g; RIN = 8.1). rRNA degradation was barely detectable in pIC-KO cells (at 20 g; RIN = 8.1) the italicized bold type designates the sgRNA sequences. the italicized bold type designates the sgRNA sequences. sgRNA constructs were delivered by transfection or electroporation or by Western blotting. all knockouts were confirmed by Western blotting. the DNA fragments were amplified and sequenced and compared with the reference sequences of the genes; ND, not determined. OAS3-KO cells and OAS3-KO cells in which OAS3 expression was restored were transfected with pIC (1 g/mL) or were mock-infected or infected with IAVNS1 (MOI = 10) or VACVE3L (MOI = 1). cells were lysed at 4 (pIC) or 24 (virus) hpi, and total RNA was isolated. is virus (VSV), the paramyxovirus Sendai virus (SeV) and the arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) all failed to generate detectable levels of RNase L-mediated rRNA cleavage in A549 cells. four other viruses from diverse groups, including three RNA viruses and one DNA virus, were able to activate RNase L in A549 cells. 2-5A accumulated to similar levels in OAS1-KO, OAS2-KO, RNase L-KO, and WT cells. but 2-5A failed to accumulate in OAS3-KO cells, suggesting minimal OAS activity during SINV infection in cells lacking OAS3. titers in cells lacking OAS1, OAS3 or RNase L were 30-fold higher in OAS3-KO cells than in parental A549 or OAS2-KO cells. infections with SINV or IAVNS1 induce up-regulation of OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3 gene expression in A549 cells. cells were lysed at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hpi, and RNA was isolated. intracellular 2-5A levels increased in infected WT, OAS1-KO, OAS2-KO, and RNase L-KO cells at 24 hpi. rRNAs were intact in infected WT, OAS1-KO, and RNase L-KO cells at 24 hpi. a dependence on OAS3 expression for RNase L activation was observed. we carried out similar infections with influenza A virus (IAV), a negative-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome, and vaccinia virus (VACV), a poxvirus with a large DNA genome. for these experiments we used an NS1 mutant of IAV (the mouse-adapted H1N1 strain A/PR/8/34), which activates the OAS\u2013RNase L pathway in A549 cells. fected with IAVNS1 (MOI = 1 pfu per cell) and at 24 hpi infectious virus in the supernatants was titered by plaque assays. the data are from three biological replicates and are expressed as means SD. the data are from three biological replicates and are expressed as means SD; **P 0.01. Activation of RNase L in HT1080 Cells That Express OAS1 p46 Is Also Dependent on OAS3. we wanted to determine if the p46 isoform of OAS1 was similar to the OAS1 p42 in its relative lack of effect as compared with OAS3 during viral infections. the levels of rRNA degradation in cells lacking OAS1 or OAS2 were similar to those in parental HT1080 cells. the viral titers from OAS3-KO HT1080 cells were ninefold higher than those from parental HT1080 cells. the loss of OAS1 or OAS2 had no detectable effects on the activation of RNase L. HT1080 cells were transfected with 500 ng/mL (A) or HME cells were transfected with 1 g/mL (B) of pIC. at 4 h (HT1080 cells) or 3 h (HME cells) post transfection RNA was purified from cell lysates and analyzed on a bioanalyzer. synthetic dsRNA than do OAS1 p42, OAS p46, or OAS2 are consistent with a prior report (25). a similar experiment was carried out using IFN treatment to up-regulate endogenous OAS proteins. biotin bound proteins were carried out and probed by immunoblotting with antibodies against OAS1, OAS2 and OAS3. rRNA degradation in pIC-transfected cells also remained intact in pIC-transfected cells lacking OAS3. OAS3 is largely responsible for the RNase L-mediated degradation of rRNA in response to pIC. we then determined the minimal amount of pIC required to induce enough 2-5A for RNase L-mediated degradation of rRNA. at very high concentrations (5\u201320 g/mL) of pIC, rRNA degradation was barely detectable.

Activation of RNase L in HT1080 Cells That Express OAS1 p46 Is Also Dependent on OAS3. the levels of rRNA degradation in cells lacking OAS1 or OAS2 were similar to those in parental HT1080 cells. the viral titers from HT1080 cells were ninefold higher than those from parental HT1080 cells. the loss of OAS1 or OAS2 had no detectable effects on the activation of RNase L. HT1080 cells were transfected with 500 ng/mL (A) or HME cells were transfected with 1 g/mL (B) of pIC. at 4 h (HT1080 cells) or 3 h (HME cells) post transfection RNA was purified from cell lysates and analyzed on a bioanalyzer. a similar experiment was carried out using IFN treatment to up-regulate endogenous OAS proteins. proteins in complexes were separated by denaturing gel electrophoresis. a trace amount of OAS1 also was evident. pIC-biotin bound proteins were carried out and probed by immunoblotting. input levels of proteins were also shown. pIC-biotin bound proteins were used for pull down compared with input protein on the immunoblot. triadenylate 2\u2032,5\u2032-p3A3 but not the diadenylate 2\u2032,5\u2032-p3A2 because only the former of these two compounds activates RNase L (17). this finding was not restricted to A549 cells because a similar dependence on OAS3 expression was observed in two other human cells. overexpression of OAS3 restricted replication of Chikungunya virus (like SINV, an alphavirus) in HeLa cells (28), consistent with our finding that SINV replicated to a higher titer in OAS3-KO cells. overexpressed OAS1 may produce enough 2-5A to activate RNase L during virus infection. similar data were obtained with HME cells (encoding OAS1 p42) OAS3 was the dominant enzyme for the activation of RNase L in three cell types tested. the levels of OAS1 and OAS2 might be high enough to produce enough 2-5A to activate RNase L even in the absence of OAS3. cells were lysed 4 h post transfection or 24 hpi, and RNA integrity was assessed. at 36 hpi supernatants were harvested and titered for infectious virus. differential subcellular localization has been reported among the OAS proteins. a study that included the crystal structure of the N-terminal enzymatically inactive 2-5A synthetase domain of OAS3 (hOAS3.DI) in complex with 19-bp dsRNA indicated that this domain I subunit has high affinity for the binding of long (>50 bp) dsRNA. WNV and SINV show enhanced replication in OAS1-KO and OAS2-KO cells at some time points. there may be similar or additional effects in other cell types. further investigation of the RNase L-dependent and possible RNase L-independent activities of OAS1 and OAS2. human HT1080 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) FBS, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 g/mL streptomycin.
