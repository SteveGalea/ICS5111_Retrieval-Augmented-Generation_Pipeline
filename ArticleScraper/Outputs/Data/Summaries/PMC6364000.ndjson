{"summary": "dengue is an arthropod-borne viral disease caused by any of the four dengue virus serotypes (DENV1 to DENV4) that are transmitted by Aedes mosquitoes (1). the risk of dengue virus infection and its public health burden are hard to estimate, but dengue currently is endemic to at least 100 countries (2). hexameric form of NS1 shows open barrel form filled with lipids and cholesterol, resembling the lipid composition of the HDL particle (6). secretion of NS1 in vertebrate cells follows the classical Golgi pathway (9) caveolae are made up of interlocking heteropolymers of a family of small proteins (caveolin-1 [CAV-1] to -3) and a second family of accessory structural proteins. peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase is an 18-kDa peptidylprolyl cis-trans isomerase. it is known to play a role in the intracellular trafficking of hetero-oligomeric forms of the steroid hormone receptors. NS1 secretion is not affected by drugs that disrupt early steps. no significant cytotoxicity was observed under 30 M GCA in any of the three cell types. no significant cytotoxicity was observed under 30 M GCA in any of the three cell types. treatment of infected C6/36 or Aag2 cells with nontoxic concentrations of Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion while significantly affecting virion release. results indicated that DENV2 and DENV4 RNA replication was not significantly affected by BFA, GCA, and Fli-06 treatments. NS1 secretion with inhibition of classical secretory pathway in C6/36 cells. NS1 secretion with inhibition of classical secretory pathway in Aag2 cells. cells were washed 3 times and treated with DMSO. luciferase were treated with DMSO and 27 M GCA for 24 h. pAc5-mCherry-GLuc-neo was constructed by cloning GLuc into the XbaI-HindIII sites of pAc5-STABLE 2-Neo. mCherry, Gaussia luciferase, and NeoR were separated by a T2A peptide. luciferase reporter is secreted in both mosquito and vertebrate cells. NS1 secretion is dependent on the CCC. previous data from our work indicated that NS1 secretion was dependent on CAV-1. NS1 secretion is inhibited in mosquito cells treated with CsA. cell toxicity of cyclosporine (CsA) in C6/36, Aag2 and BHK-21 cells. deNV NS1 in supernatants was measured using Platelia NS1 Ag (Bio-Rad) and represented as percentage of NS1 secreted compared to the control level (DMSO) total DENV RNA copies in 105 cell lysates were measured by real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan technology. a significant reduction in NS1 of about 20% secretion was observed. the effect of the HSP90 inhibitor geldanamycin (GA) in NS1 release from deNV-infected C6/36 cells was not affected after GA treatment. LD were counted in maximum projection images in at least 20 treated cells. median count differences were compared using Student's t test. NS1 was measured after 48 h posttransfection using Platelia NS1 Ag (Bio-Rad) cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA targeting Cy40 or with negative-control siRNA. LD count in C6/36 cells silenced for Cy40 expression. negative-control knockdown were measured by LD staining with Nile red. this decrease is similar to that observed in mosquito cells treated with methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD) or subjected to serum starvation. these data endorse the role proposed for the CCC in lipid traffic and homeostasis in vertebrate cells (12, 14) the effect of dengue virus infection on CCC protein levels was evaluated. the infection of BHK-21 cells run in parallel showed no changes in the expression of any of the proteins associated with the CCC. a 1.6-fold increase in CAV-1 expression levels was observed in C6/36 cells treated with MCD for 24 h. in vertebrate cells, NS1 secretion is independent of the CCC. the use of siRNAs significantly reduced expression levels of targeted proteins. NS1 secretion is not affected in vertebrate cells transfected with CAV-1, FKBP52, or Cy40 siRNAs. BHK-21 cells were transfected with 50 nM siRNA targeting FKBP52 or with allStars negative-control siRNA. LD count in BHK-21 cells silenced for cyclophilin 40 expression. DENV NS1 colocalizes with the CCC in mosquito cells. we evaluated the association between NS1 and CAV-1, FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA in mosquito cells. nuclei were stained with DAPI (in blue) in merged fluorescent images of DAPI. inset panels show magnifications of the detected spots corresponding to the colocalization. the images were analyzed using an LSM 800 confocal microscope. the bars represent means standard errors from at least 20 independent confocal cell images. fluorescent images, with red and green channels, are shown. the images were analyzed using an LSM 800 confocal microscope. PCC were used to analyze the degree of colocalization with laser sections (0.41 m) NS1 interacts with chaperone caveolin complex in mosquito cells. colocalization results suggest that NS1 interacts with CAV-1 and the chaperones of the CCC in deNV-infected cells. deNV NS1 interacts with proteins of the CCC in mosquito cells. immunoprecipitation assays with anti-NS1 and anti-CAV-1 antibodies. eluted protein complexes were analyzed for the presence of CAV-1, NS1, FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA. a positive signal (green dots) was detected in deNV-infected mosquito cells stained for both NS1 and CAV-1. positive signals were detected between NS1 and each of the chaperone proteins of CCC, Cy40, FKBP52, and CyA. no fluorescent spots were detected in mock-infected cells incubated with anti-NS1 in the absence of anti-NS1. we tested the secretion properties of ZIKV and YFV NS1 in infected C6/36 and vero E6 cells. the secretion of YFV NS1 was found to be sensitive to BFA and GCA treatment in both mosquito and vertebrate cells. the secretion of YFV NS1 was reduced in mosquito, but not in vertebrate, cells treated with the CyA inhibitor CsA. no colocalization of ZIKV or YFV NS1 with CAV-1 was observed in the vertebrate cell line. all the data taken together suggest that, like DENV NS1, ZIKV NS1 is secreted from mosquito cells by following an unconventional secretory route in association with CAV-1 and the CCC. a classical secretory route is followed for ZIKV NS1 secretion in vertebrate cells. copies were measured by real-time RT-PCR using TaqMan technology. secreted YFV NS1 amount was evaluated by Western blotting. densitometric measuring was changed to percentage of NS1 secreted. supernatants were harvested at 48 hpi, and supernatants were collected 72 hpi. secreted NS1 represented as percentage of secreted NS1 compared to the level for DMSO. energy binding obtained for FKBP52, Cy40, or CyA. lower energies obtained for binding of NS1 with the other chaperones. NS1 secretion is not affected by drugs that disrupt early steps of the classical secretion pathway. no significant cytotoxicity was observed under 30 M GCA in any of the three cell types. no significant cytotoxicity was observed under 30 M GCA in any of the three cell types. with nontoxic concentrations of Fli-06 showed no effect on NS1 secretion while significantly affecting virion release. results indicated that DENV2 and DENV4 RNA replication was not significantly affected by the drug treatments. experiments with Fli-06 were not carried out in BHK-21 due to high drug toxicity. NS1 secretion with inhibition of classical secretory pathway in C6/36 cells. NS1 secretion with inhibition of classical secretory pathway in Aag2 cells. cells were washed 3 times and treated with DMSO. pAc5-mCherry-GLuc-neo was constructed by cloning GLuc into the XbaI-HindIII sites of pAc5-STABLE 2-Neo. mCherry, Gaussia luciferase, and NeoR, each separated by a T2A peptide, are shown. luciferase reporter is secreted in both mosquito and vertebrate cells.

NS1 secretion was not affected after GA treatment. effect of geldanamycin (GA) in NS1 release from deNV-infected C6/36 cells was tested. expression of Cy40 was significantly knocked down at 48 h after siRNA transfection. LD were counted in maximum projection images in at least 20 treated cells. median count differences were compared using Student's t test. NS1 was measured after 48 h posttransfection using Platelia NS1 Ag (Bio-Rad) LD count in C6/36 cells silenced for Cy40 expression. negative-control knockdown was measured by LD staining with Nile red. LD count was measured in maximum projection images in at least 20 treated cells. cells treated with methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD) or subjected to serum starvation (Fig. 5B) these data endorse the role proposed for the CCC in lipid traffic and homeostasis in vertebrate cells (12, 14), FIG 5. Cholesterol metabolic stress modifies lipid droplets, and DENV NS1 does not colocalize. the effect of dengue virus infection on CCC protein levels was evaluated. the infection of BHK-21 cells run in parallel showed no changes in the expression of any of the proteins associated with the CCC. the infection of BHK-21 cells run in parallel showed no changes in the expression of any of the proteins associated with the CCC. in vertebrate cells, NS1 secretion is independent of the CCC. the use of siRNAs significantly reduced the expression levels of targeted proteins. NS1 secretion is not affected in vertebrate cells transfected with CAV-1, FKBP52, or Cy40 siRNAs. secreted DENV NS1 was measured after 48 h posttransfection of siRNA using Platelia NS1 Ag (Bio-Rad) LD count in BHK-21 cells silenced for FKBP52 expression. DENV NS1 colocalizes with the CCC in mosquito cells. we evaluated the association between NS1 and CAV-1. all cells were infected with DENV4 at an MOI of 3 and fixed at 18 hpi. nuclei were stained with DAPI (in blue) in merged fluorescent images of DAPI, red and green channels are shown. inset panels show magnifications of the detected spots corresponding to the colocalization. the images were analyzed using an LSM 800 confocal microscope. the images were analyzed using an LSM 800 confocal microscope. PCC were used to analyze the degree of colocalization with laser sections (0.41 m) the colocalization results suggest that NS1 interacts with CAV-1 and the chaperones of the CCC in deNV-infected cells. deNV NS1 interacts with proteins of the CCC in mosquito cells. eluted protein complexes were analyzed for presence of CAV-1, NS1, FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA. a positive signal (green dots) was detected in deNV-infected mosquito cells stained for both NS1 and CAV-1. positive signals were detected between NS1 and each of the chaperone proteins of CCC, Cy40, FKBP52, and CyA. NS1 follows CAV-1-dependent unconventional secretion in mosquito cells. other mosquito-borne flaviviruses, like yellow fever virus, secrete NS1 (25) YFV NS1 was found to be sensitive to BFA and GCA treatment in both mosquito and vertebrate cells. the secretion of YFV NS1 was found to be insensitive to BFA and GCA treatment in both mosquito and vertebrate cells. colocalization data support predictions derived from presence of conserved caveolin binding domain in ZIKV (and DENV) but not in YFV NS1. all the data taken together suggest that, like DENV NS1, ZIKV NS1 is secreted from mosquito cells by following an unconventional secretory route in association with CAV-1 and the CCC. on the other hand, YFV NS1 seems to be secreted by a classical secretory pathway secreted YFV NS1 amount was evaluated by Western blotting. densitometric measuring was changed to percentage of NS1 secreted. cells were probed for CAV-1, viral NS1 and nuclei stained with DAPI. supernatants were harvested at 48 hpi, and for YFV infection, 72 hpi. secreted NS1 represented as percentage of secreted NS1 compared to the level for DMSO. lower energies were obtained for the binding of CAV-1 with the other chaperones of the CCC than for the binding of NS1 with those same chaperones. we predict a model of interaction of NS1 with the CCC proteins in which FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA are directly bound to CAV-1. NS1 is associated with the chaperone caveolin complex (CAV-1, Cy40, FKBP52, and CyA) and that the integrity of this complex is necessary for the secretion of NS1 in infected mosquito cells. additional data suggest that in virus-infected cells, ZIKV NS1, but not YFV NS1, also associate with CAV-1. the secretion of luciferase was significantly affected after treatment with GCA and BFA. these data indicate the existence of a robust classical secretion pathway in mosquito cells. NS1 lacks a KDEL signal, yet presents a conserved and well-exposed caveolin binding domain (CBD) ER chaperones have been reported to be necessary for the secretion of recombinant proteins expressed in insect cells using a baculovirus system. the NS1 and CCC interactions in infected cells was validated by colocalization, coimmunoprecipitation, and proximity ligation assays. the capture with anti-NS1 antibodies indicated that FKBP52, Cy40, and CyA interact with NS1 in infected cells. an approximated in silico model for NS1 and complete CAV-1 interaction showed very favorable energy binding. the molecular docking also allows measuring the energy binding and distances between both crystals. however, the model predicts all these proteins interact at the same domain in NS1. a virus, Arteriviridae viruses, and hepatitis C virus have a minor effect on DENV replication (37\u201340) however, our results indicate that HSP90 is not associated with NS1 secretion but indicate the requirement of FKBP52 for NS1 exit in mosquito cells. CyA inhibition by cell treatment with CsA also resulted in diminished NS1 secretion in other viruses, such as coronaviruses, hepatitis C profound changes in lipid homeostasis have been observed in deNV-infected cells. levels of CAV-1 and FKBP52 were found to increase during DENV infection in mosquito, but not in vertebrate, cells. lipid cargo indicates high requirements of cholesterol and triglycerides in infected cells. NS1 presents a CBD (XXXxXX, where is an aromatic residue and X is any amino acid) that is well conserved among the 4 DENV serotypes and is also conserved in the ZIKV but not in the YFV NS1. a T-to-F substitution is found in the first aromatic residue. mosquito cells could be defective in a protein necessary to direct NS1 to the ER-Golgi intermediate and then follow classical secretion (28), as is suggested by the insensitivity of NS1 secretion to FLI-06 and GCA treatment. the affinity of DENV NS1 for mosquito CAV-1 may be higher for the CAV-1 of vertebrate cells, as is suggested by the predicted interaction energies for both proteins. the NS1-CCC complex is detached from ER exterior membrane by unknown mechanisms, bypassing the ERES. NS1 does not interact with LD during trafficking. a similar pathway appears to exist for the ZIKV NS1. cells from Aedes albopictus (CRL-1660; ATCC) and Aag-2 cells from Aedes aegypti (kindly provided by Fidel de la Cruz from CINVESTAV-IPN) were grown at 28\u00b0C in Eagle\u2019s minimum essential medium (EMEM) (30-2003; ATCC), supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin. serial dilutions of viral stocks or supernatants of experiments were diluted in serum-free medium and added to cell monolayers in 96-well plates.
