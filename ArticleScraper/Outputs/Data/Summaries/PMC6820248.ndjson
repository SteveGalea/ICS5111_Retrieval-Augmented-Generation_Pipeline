{"summary": "antibiotics are used to treat bacterial infections through either inhibiting or killing the target bacteria. the first antibiotic was discovered by Alexander Fleming in 1928, called penicillin. but the discovery of penicillin was preceded by the management of microbial infections in Egypt, Greece and ancient China. cathelicidins have a variety of sizes (12\u201380 amino acids) and have a wide range of structures. the molecular mechanism of antimicrobial peptides has been investigated. stem cells have shown good potential in the field of therapy. antimicrobial peptides are one of the main candidates in the treatment of bacterial diseases. properties include rapid killing and a wide range of activity that perform antimicrobial action by pore-forming the cell membrane. using peptides with a wide range of lethality and low side effects can help cure bacterial infections. phenotype M1 suggests that this peptide has an important role in the development of macrophages and cytokine production [20] other chemical properties of LL-37 are as follows: migration of neutrophils and eosinophils through the formyl-peptide receptor. transactivation of epidermis growth factors by the peptide causes the migration of keratinocytes, which results in wound healing. LL-37 is active in physiological responses to eukaryotic cells, which is essentially an antimicrobial peptide. this peptide is effective in people whose immune system is low, so that through transactivation of EGFR and angiogenesis by FPRL1 receptor and chemotaxis causes cell migration. hepcidin is rich in cysteine, the precursor of which is secreted by the liver. this peptide was discovered in 2000 and was called LEAP 1. after a while due to presence in the liver, the peptide was named \"hepcidin\" hepcidin is transmitted into the macrophage and is destroyed by lysozyme. ferritin is present in the cell membrane, allowing the release of iron. iron oxide is rapidly oxidized by ceruloplasmin, a copper-rich ferroxidase. hepcidin is bound to plasma alpha-2 macroglobulin (alpha 2M) Defensin alpha 1 Neutrophil Defensin 1 Primarily expressed in neutrophils. alpha 1B alpha 1 alpha 3 Neutrophil Defensin 3 alpha 4 Neutrophil Defensin 4 alpha 5 Defensin-5 alpha 6 Defensin-6 - Defensin 1 Secreted by leukocytes and epithelial cells of many kinds. the mRNA manages to denote the theta defensin, but the mutations cause the end codon to stop peptide production. defensin exerts other functions that include chemical absorption for monocytes, cytokines production by monocytes and epithelial cells, angiogenesis activity and response to hormones. antibiotic resistance is one of the biggest treatment problems with antibiotics. the number of resistant are constantly circulating in the communities. an emerging approach to treat infections is the use of antimicrobial peptides produced from various cells, including MSCs. mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have the ability to differentiate into mesenchymal tissues such as cartilage, bone, muscle and fat. MSCs have been obtained from bone marrow, umbilical cord, blood, placenta, skeletal muscle and adipose tissue. the peptide is specifically secreted in the secondary granules of neutrophils. it is also produced by many types of cells, including macrophages, natural killer cells, epithelial cells of the skin, airways, eyes and intestinal tract. the expression of the peptide LL-37 is controlled by inflammatory pathways. -37 peptide has different activities, all of which lead to antimicrobial activity. this includes regeneration and angiogenesis, which is done by the formyl-peptide receptor-like 1 expressed on the endothelial cells [23]. LL-37 peptide induces many cytokines and induces the production of antibodies. the expression of transgenic LL-37 leads to a significant increase in proliferation of corpuscular cells in haCaT and HEK 293 [33] with the presence of lymph node metastases in estrogen-receptor positive or ER positive cancer, clinical trials have shown an increase in peptide LL-37 activity. this peptide also interacts with P2X7 purinoceptor. hepcidin prevents iron absorption from the small intestine and releases iron from reticuloendothelial cells. macrophages and bacteria compete to absorb iron by bacteria. factors that cause hepcidin production are increased in bone marrow and anemia. hepcidin is cleansed through degradation along with ferritin. ferritin is transmitted to the macrophage and is degraded by lysozyme. role of these peptides is to defend host against bacteria, fungi and viruses. Defensin 106A 106B -Defensin 106B 107A -Defensin 107 110 -Defensin 110 136 -Defensin 136 - Defensin 1 pseudogene Not expressed in humans Have been found only in the leukocytes of the rhesus macaque and the olive baboon, Papio anubis, being vestigial in humans and other primates. defensin has weaker anti-microbial activity in Gram-positive bacteria. peptidoglycan layer thick in Gram-positive bacteria. defensin has weaker anti-microbial activity in Gram-positive bacteria. the antimicrobial peptide LL-37 is effective against Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli bacteria. the effect of -defensin peptide on the bacteria of Escherichia coli has been proven. it is better to use mesenchymal stem cells in treatment if the treatments are no longer effective. funding statement This research did not receive specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. the authors declare no conflict of interest."}
