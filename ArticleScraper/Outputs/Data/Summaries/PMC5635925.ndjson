{"summary": "MERS-CoV virions caused agglutination of human erythrocytes. the spike glycoprotein is the only surface projection of clade C beta-CoVs. however, no hemagglutination was seen for MERS-CoV S1-Fc protein. hemagglutination was scored after 2 h of incubation at 4 \u00b0C. mixing of erythrocytes with blocking buffer was used as a negative control. wells positive for hemagglutination are encircled. the mass of the main elution peak was close to that of the predicted 60-meric state of the nanoparticle (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). ELISA (SI Appendix, Fig. S4) confirmed Binding of Fc-tagged S1 subunits to the pA domain on pA-LS nanoparticles. nanoparticle-displayed MERS-CoV S1 exhibited hemagglutination activity. multivalent presentation of S1-Fc appeared critical for hemagglutination phenotype. erythrocytes were mock-treated (PBS) or NA-treated. hemagglutination was scored after 2 h of incubation at 4 \u00b0C. conditions lacking either pA-LS or MERS-CoV S1-Fc protein were used as a negative control. experiments performed at least two times. hemagglutination activity resides in domain A of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit. nanoparticle-displayed MERS-CoV S1A-Fc was capable of mediating hemagglutination. hemagglutination assay was performed at least two times. glycan array analysis was performed using NA-treated MERS-CoV S1A-loaded nanoparticles against a library of 135 glycans. a recombinant Fc-tagged HA ectodomain of a human H1N1 IAV showed no binding on the glycan array. ERS-CoV spike protein domain A predominantly bound to short, sulfated, 2,3-linked mono-sialotrisaccharides as well as to long, branched, 2,3-linked di-Sia and tri-Sia glycans with a minimum extension of 3 Gal1\u20134GlcNAc1\u20133 (LacNAc) tandem repeats. no or low binding was observed to 2,6-linked sialosides. MERS-CoV S1A-Fc nanoparticles show specific binding toward several 2,3-linked Neu5Ac glycans (salmon, 11\u201377) and some 2,6-linked Neu5Ac glycans (blue, 78\u2013130). pA-LS nanoparticles show specific binding toward several 2,6-linked Neu5Ac glycans. nonmodified Neu5Ac sialosides suggest that sia 9-O-acetylation is not a prerequisite for binding. we used a bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM)-based ELISA. no binding of MERS-CoV S1A and IAV HA was observed upon pretreatment of BSM with NA. MERS-CoV S1A comprises a sia binding preference for 2,3-coupled, 5-N-acetylated neuraminic acid. both 5-N-glycolylation and 9-O-acetylation are not tolerated. pA-LS nanoparticles were detected by ELISA with HRP-conjugated StrepMAB antibody. LS nanoparticles were detected as described in A. the experiment was performed in triplicate and repeated at least two times. a representative experiment is shown. sialoglycans are abundant in the camel nasal respiratory epithelium and the alveoli of the human lung. dromedary camels coincide with the site of MERS-CoV replication in these mammals. sialylated proteins or glycolipids on the surface of human airway epithelial cells can be used as an attachment receptor by MERS-CoV. the results provide direct evidence that sialylated proteins or glycolipids on the surface of human airway epithelial cells can be used as an attachment receptor. we performed classical hemagglutination assays commonly used to detect virus\u2013Sia interactions. unlike SARS-CoV but similar to influenza A virus (IAV), MERS-CoV virions caused agglutination of human erythrocytes. hemagglutination was scored after 2 h of incubation at 4 \u00b0C. wells positive for hemagglutination are encircled. we selected the 154-residue-long lumazine synthase (LS) protein. the mass of the main elution peak was close to that of the predicted 60-meric state of the nanoparticle (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). ELISA (SI Appendix, Fig. S4) confirmed Binding of Fc-tagged S1 subunits to the pA domain on pA-LS nanoparticles. nanoparticle-displayed MERS-CoV S1 exhibited hemagglutination activity. multivalent presentation of S1-Fc appeared critical for hemagglutination phenotype. no hemagglutination was observed with human erythrocytes desialylated. hemagglutination was scored after 2 h of incubation at 4 \u00b0C. conditions lacking either pA-LS or MERS-CoV S1-Fc protein were used as a negative control. conditions lacking either pA-LS or MERS-CoV S1-Fc protein were used as a negative control. hemagglutination activity of the MERS-CoV S1 subunit resides in its domain A. MERS-CoV S1-mediated sia-binding activity resides in its domain A. glycan array analysis was performed using NA-treated MERS-CoV S1A nanoparticles against a library of 135 glycans. a recombinant Fc-tagged HA ectodomain of a human H1N1 IAV showed no binding on the glycan array. nanoparticle-displayed MERS-CoV S1A did not agglutinate erythrocytes that exclusively contain Neu5Gc sialoglycans. the PEDV S1 protein that can bind to Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc (42) did agglutinate erythrocytes of horse origin. MERS-CoV S1A-Fc nanoparticles show specific binding toward several 2,3-linked Neu5Ac glycans (salmon, 11\u201377) and some 2,6-linked Neu5Ac glycans (blue, 78\u2013130). pA-LS nanoparticles show specific binding toward several 2,6-linked Neu5Ac glycans. a bovine submaxillary mucin is rich in 9-O-acetylated Sias. a bovine submaxillary mucin (BSM) is rich in 9-O-acetylated Sias. pretreatment of BSM with sialate\u20139-O-acetylesterase enabled its interaction. no binding of MERS-CoV S1A and IAV HA was observed. MERS-CoV S1A comprises a sia binding preference for 2,3-coupled, 5-N-acetylated neuraminic acid. both 5-N-glycolylation and 9-O-acetylation are not tolerated. pA-LS nanoparticles were detected by ELISA with HRP-conjugated StrepMAB antibody. MERS-CoV S1A Is Suited to Bind Human Mucin. 2,3-linked Sias Colocalize with Site of M. amurensis lectin II. 2,3-linked sialoglycans are abundant in the camel nasal respiratory epithelium and the alveoli of the human lung. dromedary camels coincide with the site of MERS-CoV replication in these mammals. sialylated proteins or glycolipids on the surface of human airway epithelial cells can be used as an attachment receptor by MERS-CoV. vero and Calu-3 cells were treated with or without NA and inoculated with MERS-CoV or IAV. clade A betacoronaviruses, alphacoronaviruses TGEV, PEDV, and FeCV interact with sias via their spike domains. despite structural conservation, the observation that genetically distant CoVs comprise Sia-binding activity implies that this feature has independently evolved several times throughout CoV history. reversible interaction with Sia by viruses lacking a receptor-destroying enzyme is governed by binding equilibrium (57) only nanoparticle-based assays proved sensitive enough to detect the direct interaction between MERS-CoV S1 and sialoglycans. the findings provide formal evidence that sialoglycans may serve as an attachment receptor for virus particles, and thereby aid viral entry. high-affinity binding to proteinaceous receptors by MERS-CoV, TGEV, and MHV appears sufficient for entry in cultured cells. zoonotic MERS-CoV has evolved a binding site of low affinity but high selectivity for Neu5Ac that excludes Neu5Gc. the high sequence identity of spike-interacting residues on dromedary and human DPP4 facilitates cross-species transmission without the need for adaptive mutations (17, 67) the reported differential receptor distribution in the respiratory tract may account for the observed dissimilar MERS-CoV\u2013induced pathology in dromedaries and humans. genes encoding the 6,7-dimethyl-8-ribityllumazine synthase (LS) of A. aeolicus and domain B of pA were synthesized using human-preferred codons. the cysteine at position 37 and asparagine at position 102 of LS were mutated to alanine and glutamine respectively. expression medium was replaced with 293 SFM II-based expression medium (Gibco Life Technologies) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2. expressed proteins were stored at 4 \u00b0C until further use. plasmids encoding the CoV-S1 subunit (or a domain thereof) were generated. pA-tagged proteins were purified from tissue culture supernatants 5\u20136 d posttransfection by pA affinity chromatography (17-0780-01;
