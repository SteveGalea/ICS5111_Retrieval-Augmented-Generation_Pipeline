{"summary": "human infections with avian influenza H5N1 virus were first observed during largescale poultry outbreaks in Hong Kong in 1997. 306 laboratoryconfirmed human H5N1 cases have been reported from Asia, Europe and Africa of whom 185 have died. the influenza virus surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) is the most important antigenic determinant for virusneutralizing antibodies generated during natural infection. retroviral and lentiviral pseudotypes have been used in lieu of replicationcompetent virus to study neutralizing antibody responses to viral infection. 5, 6, 7 These pseudotypes encode reporter genes and bear foreign viral envelopes of interest. the transfer of marker genes to target cells depends on the function of the envelope protein. HAs of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses (HPAI) can be cleaved by ubiquitous host proteases resulting in lethal systemic infection. HA has glutamine at position 226 and glycine at position 228 (human viruses have leucine at 226 and serine at 228). 20 cell lines were cultured in DMEM with Glutamax and high glucose. each plate of 293T cells was transfected with 1 g gag/pol construct. each plate was transfected with 1 g gag/pol construct, 1.5 g of Luc reporter construct, and 1.5 g HA or VSVGexpressing construct. sera hyperimmune sheep sera raised against recombinant HA from different influenza subtypes. HIV(HA) was not tested on porcine cells. sera hyperimmune sheep sera raised against recombinant HA from different influenza subtypes. sera against these viruses were produced in specific pathogenfree white leghorn chickens by intramuscular inoculation with viruses (inactivated by betapropiolactone if HPAI virus) grown in embryonated eggs and challenged 3 weeks later with the same virus. heparineanticoagulated plasma was obtained 8\u201327 weeks after illness onset. all HI and MN assays were performed against NIBRG14 except those shown in bold where the homologous virus was used. titers were obtained using the GFP reporter. HI assays performed using horse erythrocytes except for those against A/Vietnam/CL26/2004 virus which were performed with guineapig erythrocytes. MLV(HA) titers were obtained using the GFP reporter. a pUC-based plasmid was amplified by PCR and cloned into expression vector pI.18. the luciferase (Luc) reporter construct MLVLuc has been described. 20 cell lines were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified eagle medium. quail QT6, canine MDCK, porcine PK15 and STIOWA cells are presented as infectious units (IU) per milliliter. quail QT6, canine MDCK, canine PK15 and STIOWA cells are presented as infectious units (IU) per milliliter. avian sera raised against the H5 viruses, H5N1 (C1: A/Chicken/Scot/59(Wilson) and H5N2 (C3: A/Ost/Den/72420/96), H5N3 (C4: A/Tern/South Africa/61), H5N7 (C5: AV1356/03) and H5N9 (C6: A/TKY/ONT/7732/66) were MLV(HA) HI (horse) MN C1: H5N1 (1959) 800\u20131600 128 128\u2013256 191\u2013194 C2: H5N1 (2005) 3200 256 512 253\u2013270 C3: H5N2 (1996) 1600 256 64 61\u201378 C4: H5N3 (1961) 3200 128 512 497 C5: H5N7 (2003) 800 512 32 55\u201361 C6: HI and MN assays performed with NIBRG14 virus except for those where the virus used is shown in brackets. the NIBRG14 virus contains the HA (with the polybasic cleavage site removed) and NA of the wildtype antigen donor strain. IC90neutralizing antibody titers were determined as the highest serum dilution resulting in a 90% reduction of infection compared with a pseudotype virus only control. for Luc, titers 100 are designated negative; for r 2 correlation plots, the geometric mean titers were used. HI assay Hemagglutination inhibition assays with horse erythrocytes were conducted at the health protection agency (Colindale, UK) using methods described previously. 2, 22 Briefly, 25 l of a twofold serial dilution series from 1:8 to 1:1024 of RDEtreated serum samples were incubated for 1 h at room temperature with an equal volume of the NIBRG14 virus dilution, followed by the addition of 25 l of the guinea pig erythrocytes were used as horse erythrocytes were unavialable. the antigen used in the assays was NIBRG14 virus. MN titers less than 20 were considered undetectable. iter of MLV(HA)Luc on 293T cells was 1.6 107 RLU/ml. all neutralization assays were performed using the MLV(HA) pseudotype assay. a broad range of IC90neutralizing antibodies was observed in these seras. correlations of NIBRG14 horse HI and MN assay titers with MLV(HA) titers for the H5 positive sera and 50 agestratified sera are shown in Figure 2a. an additional panel of 50 human sera from healthy subjects also tested negative by the MLV(HA) assay for neutralizing antibodies against H5. turkey HI titers for ferret FA (infected with A/HK/489/97 H5N1) and ferret FB (infected with A/HK/213/03 H5N1) were 240 and 640 respectively. the titer range was 50\u20133200 for GFP and 100\u20133200 for Luc. all HI and MN assays were performed against NIBRG14 except those shown in bold where the homologous virus was used. all chicken sera except serum from the H5N9 immunized chicken (serum C6) were tested for neutralizing antibody responses against A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA. sheep sera had positive singleradial haemolysis (SRH) titers against their respective antigens. all sheep sera had positive singleradial haemolysis titers against their respective antigens. HA retroviral (MLV) and lentiviral (HIV) vector particles pseudotyped with Influenza A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA were made by cotransfection of an HAexpressing plasmid, pI.18/VN1194 HA, with plasmids encoding gagpol and GFP or Luc vector genome in 293T cells. culture supernatants were used to infect human 293T cells as a representative a panel of 50 agestratified sera with HI titers was screened by NIBRG14 MN, NIBRG14 horse HI and by MLV(HA) assay. all sera tested negative for antibodies against H5. no false positive results were observed in the sera from older individuals. HI and MN assays performed against NIBRG14 virus. total number of sera assayed is 56 (six positive for antibodies against H5 and 50 H5 negative control sera) lines were fitted to the data by using Microsoft Excel 2003. sera from ferrets infected with influenza B viruses (F7A and F7B) and from uninfected ferrets were negative for the presence of antibodies to A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA. er range was 50\u20133200 for GFP and 100\u20133200 for Luc. titers were obtained using the GFP reporter. all chicken sera except serum from the H5N9 immunized chicken (serum C6) were tested for neutralizing antibody responses against A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 HA. HI and MN assays were performed against NIBRG14. serum from sheep S5, immunized with an H7 virus was also assayed against the reverse genetics RED3 H7 virus. high titer sera raised in sheep against H3, H7 and H9 viruses failed to neutralize the MLV(HA) pseudotype. sera from ferrets infected with influenza B viruses and a panel of 50 agestratified human sera negative for H5 antibodies by NIBRG14 MN and horse HI were also negative. the pseudotype assay is significantly more sensitive than the turkey erythrocyte HI and at least as sensitive as the horse erythrocyte HI and MN for the detection of antibodies to H5 HA. sera from ferrets infected with live influenza A/Viet Nam/1194/2004 that had weak turkey HI titers against this virus have high levels of antibodies. antisera to an avian H5N1 strain isolated in 1959 could neutralize the VN1194 pseudotype at high titer. only chickens immunized with A/TKY/ONT/7732/66 (H5N9) did not produce high neutralizing antibody titers against the homologous virus. crossclade neutralization studies have shown that there is often poor antigenic crossreactivity between viruses belonging to the Indonesian (clade 2) and Vietnamese (clade 1) sublineages. a need to study the seroprevalence of influenza H5N1 in countries where outbreaks of H5N1 have occurred in humans. this assay is well placed to assess protective neutralizing immunity in sera from experimentally immunized animals. further development of galbased pseudotype assays will allow wider application as an ELISAtype assay in laboratories without specialized equipment. this study was funded by the medical research council, the Wellcome Trust and the health protection agency. the study was funded by the medical research council, the wellcome trust and the health protection agency.
