{"summary": "the disaster prevention and protection organizational structure can be divided into 3 levels: the central government, the county (or city), and the township. response centers at each level can be activated based on the scale of the disaster and other pertinent factors. the response center determines policy, allocates resources, and supports the first line response. the government set up a disaster prevention and control framework and response process based on the emergency response experiences in the united states and Japan since 2000. the framework regulates work details and roles in pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis disaster stages. when a disaster strikes, the Ministry of Health and Welfare will set up a transit center and provide relief resources. in 2003, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) occurred in Taiwan. response efforts were too slow, resulting in an inability to control the epidemic. the government decided to incorporate biological disasters into the Disaster Prevention and Protection Organizational Framework. national science and technology center for disaster reduction (NCDR) has played a role in disaster prevention and control technology development, disaster information analysis, and the provision of situational awareness. the national science and technology center for disaster reduction (NCDR) has also invested in transparently providing information in real time to policymakers and the public. the framework regulates work details and roles in pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis disaster stages. if a disaster strikes, the ministry will set up a transit center and provide relief resources. the ministry will also support medical or human resource allocation, emergency medical services, patient referral, and environmental clearance. the central emergency operation center (CEOC) is operated by the Executive Yuan. the CEOC executes disaster surveillance and risk assessment. in an emergency, depending on the disaster severity, type, affected area, the CEOC may be activated. each authority will dispatch representatives to the CEOC. the NHCC connects with the CEOC in similar ways. compared with other EOCs, the structure of CECC is more flexible. NHCC provides information integration and command in response to public health emergencies. the central Epidemic Command Center (CECC), the Biological Pathogen Disaster Command Center, and the bioterrorism Attack Response Command Center (CMEOC) the commander can adjust the response structure when the CECC is activated. the command structure of CECC is designed to be very flexible in order to dispatch the department's resources efficiently and meet response needs appropriately. however, some response staff may not have a clear understanding of their duties or appropriate responses, which may reduce the efficiency of response operations during emergencies. public health authorities in Taiwan should learn and implement the incident command system (ICS) through well-established procedures, CECC response staff will fully understand their duties during response. in the united states, it is common to conduct full-scale or tabletop exercises. the united states has adopted an \u201call-hazards approach\u201d. it has already established a doctrine (National Incident Management System, NIMS) and framework (National Response Framework, NRF) that provides each department with disaster management principles and duties to follow during any type of disaster. CDC held a bioterrorist threat exercise in Georgia. public health authorities in Taiwan already hold regular exercises and training. partnerships between departments and agencies can be strengthened prior to an incident occurring."}
