{"summary": "Background Trimethoprim/sufamethoxazole (TMP/SMX) is the recommended treatment for Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP). however, the efficacy and safety of alternative salvage treatments are less guarauteed especially when patient experiences treatment failure and/or an adverse drug reactions (ADR). the overall outcomes of P. jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in HIV-infected patients have improved. mortality associated with PCP is still as high as 20 \u2013 30% in non-HIV-infected patients. patients with compatible symptoms and radiological findings confirmed as PCP by a immunohistochemical stain using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens from January 2013 through July 2015 were identified. patients younger than 16 years old, patients who were transferred to another hospital within 7 days of diagnosis were excluded from the analysis. AL fluid containing 103 cells was centrifuged at 500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature. a medical laboratory technologist counted cells and a laboratory medicine specialist verified it. a standardized volume of 2 ml was extracted. crit, platelet, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, total bilirubin, aspartate/alanine aminotransferase, and C-reactive protein were assessed. Vasopressor usage and oxygen requirement were used to categorize initial PCP severity as mild (partial pressure of arterial oxygen [PaO2] >70 mmHg or alveolar-arterial oxygen difference [AaDO2] 35), moderate (PaO2 70 mm continuous variables were analyzed by the Mann-Whitney U test. binary logistic regression models for multivariate analyses were constructed using the stepwise forward method. cii was performed with a commercially available mouse monoclonal antibody. antibody reacts with human and rodent pneumocystis cysts and trophozoites. adenovirus was cultured by standard techniques. the Ct value was defined as the cycle number during which the fluorescence generated by a reaction crossed the fluorescence threshold [15]. clinical data and definitions All medical records were reviewed retrospectively. treatment failure was defined as clinical deterioration during the first 5 days of therapy or lack of improvement after 7 or more days of treatment. patients who required salvage regimens owing to treatment failure or ADR were categorized as the case group, while others who responded to TMP/SMX were categorized as the control group. patients with hematologic malignancy included those with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (13, 14.3%), acute myeloid leukemia (4, 4.4%), acute lymphoblastic leukemia (3, 3.3%), adult peripheral T-cell lymphoma (2, 2.2%), T-lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma (2, 2.2%), angioimmunoblastic lymphoma (1, 1.1%), angioimmunoblastic lymphom twenty-one patients had CMV viremia. median time from symptom onset to start of treatment was 7 days. risk factors associated with TMP/SMX treatment failure. solid organ transplantation as an underlying condition, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil as immunosuppressants, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and chronic heart failure as co-morbidities. glomerular filtration rate (GFR) 50 mL/min in laboratory findings, and consolidation as a radiographic finding were frequently found in the case group. or ADR were 17.1% (95% CI, 6.6\u201333.7%), 100% (95% CI, 92.9\u2013100%), 100% (95% CI, 54\u2013100%), and 63.3% (95% CI, 51.7\u201373.9%), respectively. none of the patients with all three risk factors died within 30 days.
