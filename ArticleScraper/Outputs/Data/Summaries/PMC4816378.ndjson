{"summary": "NNIDSS covered 37 infectious diseases, which were classified into 3 categories (A\u2013C), in a descending order according to disease severity; scarlet fever belonged to category B. each clinical case of scarlet fever reported in Beijing was followed for 3 weeks after the onset of disease. patients with scarlet fever or pharyngitis from whom GAS was isolated were identified as confirmed GAS patients. the isolates were immediately spread onto 5% sheep blood agar plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. ion Thirteen superantigens (speA\u2013speC, speF\u2013speM, smeZ, and ssa) were detected by subjecting each GAS isolate to real-time PCR. specific PCR primers were used to amplify the gene of each superantigen. NNIDSS covered 37 infectious diseases, which were classified into 3 categories (A\u2013C), in a descending order according to disease severity. each clinical case of scarlet fever reported in Beijing was followed for 3 weeks after the onset of disease. collaborating district laboratories isolated and identified pharyngeal swab strains. the isolates were immediately spread onto 5% sheep blood agar plates. they were then incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. superantigen Detection Thirteen superantigens were detected by subjecting each GAS isolate to real-time PCR. specific PCR primers were used to amplify the gene of each superantigen in a 40-L real-time PCR reaction system. superantigen profiles were investigated for various emm types of GAS isolates. the annual number of scarlet fever cases in Beijing during 2006\u20132010 ranged from 1,193 to 2,264. annual incidence rates ranged from 7.0 cases to 14.3 cases/100,000 population. peak monthly incidence rates in 2011 were 2.9\u20136.7 times those in 2006\u20132010. emm subtypes and superantigens emm12 type accounted for 76.4% (494/647) of all GAS isolates. the leading emm subtypes were emm12.0 (65.7%), emm1.0 (16.8%), emm12.19 (5.7%), and emm12.1 (2.5%) patients, by clinical diagnosis p value Total, n = 647 5 y, n = 246 >5 y, n = 401 Male, n = 402 Female, n = 245 Scarlet fever, n = 430 Pharyngitis, n = 217 emm type 12 203 (82.5) 291 (72.6) 0.004 303 (75.4) 191 (78.0) 0.453 331 (77.0) 163 (75.1) 0.599 87 299 (74.4) 194 (79.2) 0.164 326 (75.8) 167 (77.0) 0.747 493 (76.2) SpeI 190 (77.2) 302 (75.3) 0.578 301 (74.9) 191 (78.0) 0.373 327 (76.0) 165 (76.0) 1.000 492 (76.0) SpeJ 47 (19.1) 92 (22.9) 0.249 87 (21.6) 52 (21.2) 0.900 99 (23.0) 40 (18 25 profiles of superantigens were found in the GAS isolates. of the 494 emm12 isolates, 411 (83.2%) had the following superantigen profile. resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin was found in 96.1%, 93.7%, and 79.4% of the isolates. the odds of having a red rash was higher for participants infected with an emm1 versus emm12 type strain (OR 1.63, 95% CI 1.01\u20132.62; p = 0.046) and for participants 5 years of age (OR 2.52, 95% CI 1.74\u20133.65; p0.001). 5.1) Ref 57 (72.2) 437 (76.9) Ref 43 (68.9) 451 (77.2) Ref 1 51 (17.4) 60 (16.9) 1.03 (0.68\u20131.58), 0.884 83 (19.3) 28 (12.9) 1.63 (1.01\u20132.62), 0.046 20 (25.3) 91 (16.0) 1.80 (1.02\u20133.16), 0.043 18 (28.6) 93 (15.9) 2.15 (1.17\u20133.93), the annual number of scarlet fever cases in Beijing during 2006\u20132010 ranged from 1,193 to 2,264. annual incidence rates ranged from 7.0 cases to 14.3 cases/100,000 population. in 2011, scarlet fever cases peaked twice yearly. a cluster of scarlet fever was defined as onset of >2 clinical cases within a 7-day period in a school or kindergarten. 37\u2013131 clusters (85\u2013316 cases) occurred during 2006\u20132010 in Beijing. 401 clusters (1,116 cases) occurred during 2011. emm type or SAg No. (%) patients, by age p value No. (%) patients, by sex p value No. (%) patients, by clinical diagnosis p value Total, n = 647 5 y, n = 246 >5 y, n = 401 Male, n = 402 Female, n = 245 Scarlet fever, n = 430 Pharyngitis, n = 217 emm type 12 203 (82.5) 1.000 401 (99.8) 244 (99.6) 1.000 429 (99.8) 216 (99.5) 1.000 645 (99.7) SpeG 246 (100.0) 399 (99.5) 0.528 400 (99.5) 245 (100.0) 0.529 428 (99.5) 217 (100.0) 0.554 645 (99.7) SpeH 192 (78.0) 301 (75.1) 0.387 299 (74.4) 194 (79.2) 0.164 326 (75 a total of 25 profiles of superantigens were found in the 111 emm1 isolates. 93 (83.8%) had the following superantigen profile. resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin was found. the percentage of emm1 and emm12 strains resistant to clindamycin (87.4% vs. 77.9%, respectively; p = 0.025) but not between the percentage of those resistant to erythromycin (99.1% vs. 96.4%, respectively; p = 0.134) or tetracycline (97.3% vs. 93.1%, respectively; p = 0.097) p value Yes, n = 430 No, n = 217 OR (95% CI), p value Yes, n = 63 No, n = 584 OR (95% CI), p value emm type 12 232 (79.2) 262 (74.0) Ref 331 (77.0) 163 (75.1) Ref 57 (72.2) 437 (76.9) Ref 43 (68.3) 451 (77.2) Ref 1 51 (17.4) 60 (16.9) emm12 was the predominant type among the circulating GAS strains. resistance to erythromycin, tetracycline, and clindamycin was high among the isolates. the winter peak in 2010 was higher than the summer peak. this implies that this epidemic of scarlet fever started at the end of 2010. two previously unreported genomic insertions were identified in emm12 strains isolated during the 2011 scarlet fever outbreak. ssa became the primary superantigen of emm1 and emm12 isolates. ssa became the primary superantigen of emm1 and emm12 isolates. all GAS isolates from the 2011 Beijing epidemic harbored speC. the 2011 scarlet fever epidemic in Beijing was characteristic of other scarlet fever epidemics. the level of resistance to clindamycin was lower than that to erythromycin."}
