{"summary": "infections of the respiratory tract are the most common types of acute infections in children and adults (1). young children have on average 6 to 8 respiratory viral infections per year, while adults have 2 to 4 infections per year (2). a large number of respiratory infections can be divided into upper respiratory tract infections (URTI) and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) samples from immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed patients tested by multiplex PCR assay in our institution. we also noticed the high incidence of coronaviruses, their epidemic potential, and their low impact on respiratory health. tracheal aspirates (n = 152), sputum samples (n = 89), pleural effusion (n = 59) and pulmonary biopsy (n = 24) samples were transported to the laboratory within 4 h. nucleic acid extraction was performed using the QIAamp viral RNA minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) fourteen respiratory viruses were detectable by this technique. adenovirus (AdV), human rhinovirus/enterovirus (HRV/EV), HCoV-229E, HCoV-HKU1, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63, HMPV, influenza virus types A and B, PIV 1 to 4 and RSV. additional specimens were obtained either from mixed medical departments of Strasbourg University Hospital or from other regional institutions. samples included were nasopharyngeal swabs (Sigma Virocult, Medical Wire and Equipment; n = 2,953), bronchoalveolar lavage fluids (n = 1,348), oropharyngeal aspirates (n = 947), tracheal aspirates (n = 152), sputum samples (n = 89 is, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, dyspnea, acute respiratory distress syndrome, wheezing, or indicative chest X-ray abnormalities were classified as URTI. all samples were collected and tested via methods that conform to the ethical legislation in place. the median age of patients was 20.1 years (range, 1 day to 93.9 years) no respiratory virus was detectable in the remaining 56.3% of specimens. HRV/EV were the most frequently detected viruses (48.81%) among overall positive respiratory samples. data include all respiratory viruses detected in monoinfected samples. the number of samples included in the immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed groups was 831 and 5,078, respectively. median age in this group was 22.8 years. HCoVs were the second most commonly detected viruses in immunosuppressed patients. HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 were the most frequently detected subtypes among overall samples. HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 were the most frequently detected subtypes among overall samples, followed by HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43. Detection frequencies of HCoV subtypes over the 4-year study period Respiratory virus No. of positive samples (%) in patient groupa P valueb All Immunosuppressed Nonimmunosuppressed HCoV-229E 120 (33.80) 21 (37.50) 95 (32.65) NS HCoV-HKU1 115 (32.39) 17 (30.36) 96 (32.99) NS, not significant. 63 was significantly higher in immunosuppressed patients (P = 0.04). HCoV-OC43 predominated in nonimmunosuppressed patients (P = 0.01). the impact on respiratory health due to HCoV infection remains poorly understood. associations observed between HCoV and nonviral pathogens are described in Table S2 of the supplemental material. however, we failed to observe any episode of LRTI in immunosuppressed patients that was exclusively explained by a single HCoV infection. HCoV infection in immunosuppressed patients predominately results in URTI. a total of 379 (6.3%) respiratory samples were shown to harbor more than one virus. HRV/EV, HCoV, and RSV were the most frequently observed viruses. we found that 49.8% (177/355) of all detected HCoV was in coinfected samples. this proportion reached 57.1% (32/56) when we restricted the analysis to immunosuppressed patients. HCoV infections are frequently associated with other respiratory viruses. 365 dual-infected specimens were assessed using univariate analysis. a unique and highly significant positive association was observed between HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 (OR, 3.50; 95% CI, 1.75 to 6.89; P = 0.0002).

HRV/EV were the most frequently detected viruses. the number of samples included in the immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed groups was 831 and 5,078, respectively. the median age in this group was 22.8 years. the frequencies of HRV/EV and HCoV were significantly higher in immunosuppressed patients than in nonimmunosuppressed patients. HCoVs were the second most commonly detected viruses in immunosuppressed patients. HCoVs were the most frequently detected subtypes among overall samples. HKU1 were the most frequently observed coronaviruses in children over 3 years. some variation occurred in the percentage of each subtype between the different age groups. there was no significant difference in the detection frequencies between immunosuppressed and nonimmunosuppressed groups. acute URTI and LRTI were documented in 52% (n = 26) and 28% (n = 14) of samples. the 20% (n = 10) of remaining HCoV-positive samples were obtained either during prolonged cough investigations or from systematic solid organ transplantation follow-up, without specific acute URTI or LRTI symptoms. associations observed between HCoV and nonviral pathogens are described in Table S2 of the supplemental material. however, we failed to observe any episode of LRTI in immunosuppressed patients that was exclusively explained by a single HCoV infection. however, HCoV was the only detected pathogen in 58% of URTI in immunosuppressed patients. 52.9) 2 (50.0) 10 (76.9) Cough 23 (46.0) 7 (36.8) 12 (70.6) 2 (50.0) 4 (30.8) Fever of >38\u00b0C 14 (28.0) 9 (47.4) 3 (17.6) 0 (0.0) 4 (30.8) Pneumonia 7 (14.0) 5 (26.3) 1 (5.9) 1 (25.0) 0 (0.0) 1 (7.7) Acute bronchitis 3 (6.0) 1 (5.3) 2 (11.8) HCoV, and RSV were the most frequently observed viruses in total collected samples. the HCoV frequency was significantly higher in immunosuppressed patients than in nonimmunosuppressed patients (P = 0.002) the proportion of HCoV was in coinfected samples. a total of 365 dual-infected specimens was assessed using univariate analysis. we observed a unique and highly significant positive association between HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1.

HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-OC43 infections occurred more frequently in early childhood than infections due to the HCoV-229E and HCoV-HKU1 subtypes. authors suggested that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 might elicit a protective immunity against the subsequent infections by HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E. the pattern of negative associations with such a DNA virus in our survey argues in favor of a more general activation of viral sensing and innate defenses during respiratory viral infections. the detailed analysis of HCoV subtypes led us to observe variations in the preferential associations between viruses within the HCoV family.
