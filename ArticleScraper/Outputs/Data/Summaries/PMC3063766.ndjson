{"summary": "the term encephalomyelitis refers to inflammation in the brain and spinal cord that results from the immune response to virus infection. in humans, the viruses most commonly identified as causes of viral encephalomyelitis are herpesviruses and RNA viruses in the enterovirus (e.g., polio, enterovirus 71), rhabdovirus (e.g., rabies), alphavirus (e.g., eastern equine, Venezuela infections with encephalitic viruses are initiated outside the CNS. most viruses that can cause encephalitis more often cause asymptomatic infection or a febrile illness without neurologic disease. encephalomyelitis is an uncommon complication of infection. infection through the exposed end processes of neurons in the nasal olfactory epithelium followed by transport of the virus to the olfactory lobe within the CNS. in humans this pathway may be important only in rare cases of aerosol exposure to a neurotropic virus [8]\u2013[10]. in tissue culture systems most of these viruses can infect many types of cells. many viruses cause more severe CNS disease in the young. immature neurons support more efficient virus replication and greater virus-induced cell death than mature neurons. equine encephalitis and La Crosse viruses cause symptomatic neurologic disease almost exclusively in children. the ability to control inflammation through induction of regulatory T cells and suppression of lymphocyte function by infected neurons can be an important determinant of outcome [22], 23]. a noncytolytic immune mechanism for virus clearance can be employed to control or eliminate infection. if infected cells are allowed to survive, the clearance of virus must include mechanisms for inhibiting intracellular synthesis of virus nucleic acid and protein. IFN- acts through a Jak/STAT signaling pathway to activate an antiviral response that suppresses virus replication in motor neurons without toxicity. antibody to the E2 viral glycoprotein present on the surface of infected neurons suppresses virus replication in all populations of neurons through a pathway that requires bivalent antibody. noncytolytic virus clearance results in viral nucleic acid in the CNS. a need for long-term local immune responses to prevent reactivation of infection and progressive disease."}
