{"summary": "changes in temperature can affect both host and parasite biology, leading to complex and difficult to predict outcomes. a successful host shift relies on a number of stages occurring. a pathogen must be able to replicate sufficiently to infect the novel host. changes in temperature may allow differential production and survival of parasite transmission stages, and changes in replication rates, generation times, infectivity and virulence. temperature is also known to impact vector-borne disease transmission through multiple effects on vector life cycles and transmission behaviours [20,34\u201337]. viral load is used as a measure of DCV\u2019s ability to persist and replicate in a host, which has previously been shown to be tightly correlated to host mortality. we also examine how proxies for thermal optima and cellular function relate to virus susceptibility across temperatures, as increasing temperatures may have broad effects on both host and parasite. two vials of 0\u20131 day old male flies were randomly assigned to one of three potential temperature regimes. flies were anesthetized on CO2 and inoculated using a 0.0125 mm diameter stainless steel needle. the bent tip of the needle was dipped into the DCV solution and pricked into the pleural suture on the thorax of the flies. the order that the fly species were infected was randomized each day. each block contained a day 0 and day 2 replicate for each species. of the 45 species, 42 had 3 biological replicates. qRT-PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus system. replicates were distributed across plates in a randomised block design. each qRT-PCR plate contained four standard samples. individual flies were placed in 4 ml glass vials (ST5012, Ampulla, UK) each 2 days flies were tipped onto fresh food every 2 days. temperature was controlled using a heated/cooled circulator (TXF200, Grant Instruments, Cambridgeshire, UK) flies were held in 10ml-3 airtight plastic chambers constructed from Bev-A-Line V Tubing. all measures were carried out during the day inside a temperature controlled incubator. the set up followed that of Okada et al. (2011)[60]. volume of CO2 was calculated as VCO2 = FR (Fe CO2 \u2013Fi CO2) / (1-Fi CO2). the order in which flies were assayed (chamber order) was corrected for statistically. wing length was measured as a proxy for body size. phylogeny was constructed using the BEAST program (version 1.8.4,[64]. genes were partitioned into three groups each with their own molecular clock models. the three partitions were mitochondrial (COI, COII); ribosomal (28S); and nuclear (Adh, SOD, Amyrel, RpL32). i n h 4 + C T m x h 5 + u p : h t + e h i t Where y is the change in viral load of the ith biological replicate of host species h, for temperature t (high, medium or low) up are the random phylogenetic species effects and e the model residuals. we excluded D. pseudoobscura from the full model as data for BMR was not collected, but included it in models that did not include any fixed effects. the exceptions were the residual variances for which an inverse-gamma prior was used with shape and scale equal to 0.001. experimental infections We used Drosophila C virus (DCV) clone B6A. the virus was prepared as described previously [57]. the virus was grown in Schneider\u2019s Drosophila line 2 cells. oral inoculation has been shown to lead to stochastic infection outcomes in D. melanogaster [55] both oral and pin-pricked infections follow a similar course, with both resulting in the same tissues becoming infected with DCV. qRT-PCR was performed using quantitative Reverse Transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) total RNA was extracted from the Trizol homogenised flies, reverse-transcribed with Promega GoScript reverse transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamer primers. qRT-PCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems StepOnePlus system. Ct is the difference between the cycle thresholds of the DCV qRT-PCR and the endogenous control gene (RpL32) for each species the viral load of day 2 flies relative to day 0 flies was calculated as 2-Ct; where Ct = Ctday0 \u2013Ctday2. group of 10, 0\u20131 day old male flies from 44 species were acclimatised at the three experimental temperatures for 5 days. this was repeated in three blocks in order to get three repeat measures of metabolic rate for each of the species, at each of the three experimental temperatures. the temperature of knock down was ascertained by a disturbance method. the first chamber was left empty as a reference cell, to acquire a baseline reading for all subsequent chambers at the start and end of each set of runs. air was flushed into each chamber for 2 minutes, before reading the previous chamber. readings were taken every second for 10 minutes by feeding the exiting air through a LiCor LI-7000 infrared gas analyser. genes were partitioned into three groups each with their own molecular clock models. the three partitions were mitochondrial (COI, COII); ribosomal (28S); and nuclear (Adh, SOD, Amyrel, RpL32). the BEAST analysis was run twice to ensure convergence for 1000 million MCMC generations sampled every 10000 steps. the MCMC process was examined using the program Tracer (version 1.6, [65] to ensure convergence and adequate sampling. the constructed tree was then visualised using FigTree (version 1.4.3, [66]). the phylogenetic covariance matrix, Vp, describes the inter-specific variances in each trait and the inter-specific covariances between them. the residual covariance matrix, Ve, describes the within-species variance that can be both due to real within-species effects and measurement or experimental errors. results were not sensitive to the choice of prior by fitting models with inverse-Wishart and flat priors for the variance covariance matrices. all confidence intervals (CI\u2019s) reported are 95% highest posterior density intervals. both models were run with wing length as a proxy for body size. the host phylogeny explains a large proportion of the inter-specific variation in viral load across all three temperatures. we also calculated the proportion of between species variance that can be explained by the phylogeny as vp/(vp+ vs) [71]. d the inter-specific variance into that explained by the host phylogeny under a Brownian model of evolution (vp), and a species-specific variance component that is not explained by the phylogeny (vs). vp is the variance in between-species effects, which are structured by the phylogeny, and vr is the variance in within species effects. the responses of individual species show that some species have increasing viral load as temperature increases. however, this seems unlikely as at 2 days post infection at the medium temperature (22\u00b0C), viral load peaks and then plateaus. neither CTmax nor CTmin were found to be significant predictors of viral load. the host phylogeny explained a large proportion of the variation in thermal maximum (CTmax: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.84, 1) and thermal minima (CTmin: 0.98, 95% CI: 0.92, 0.99, see S1 Text Fig C) a series of measurement error models gave a slope of -9.8 but with very wide credible intervals (-62.5, 42.6) susceptibilities of different species responded in different ways to changes in temperature. there was a strong phylogenetic correlation in viral load across the three experimental temperatures. but the variance in viral load increased with temperature, whereas the mean viral load did not show the same trend. temperature is an important abiotic factor in many cellular and physiological processes. previous studies that found phylogenetic signal in host susceptibility were carried out at a single experimental temperature [9,41] therefore, the patterns observed could be explained by some host clades being assayed at sub-optimal thermal conditions. temperature is just one of the potential environmental factors that will influence the different stages of a host shift event. a controlled method of viral inoculation allows us to standardize inoculation dose so we can ask, given equal exposure, how does temperature affect the ability of a pathogen to persist. understanding how environmental factors might affect broader taxonomic groups of hosts and pathogens requires further study if we are to better understand host shifts."}
