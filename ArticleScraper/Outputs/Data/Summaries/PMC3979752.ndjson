{"summary": "trivalent vaccine strains have been developed and are used for the influenza virus protection. the most acceptable current available strategy is the intramuscular administration of inactivated vaccines produced by egg-based manufacturing systems. levels of antibody induced by the inactivated vaccine have been observed to decrease by 75% over an 8-month period. unized mucosally with an M2 or virus like particles (VLPs) adjuvanted with cholera toxin (CT) demonstrated better protection compared to mice subjected to parenteral immunization. investigators have attempted to identify nontoxic subunits with adjuvanticity by removing either subunit A or subunit B [16] lactic acid bacteria (LAB) presenting influenza virus antigens have been studied [3], [18], [19]. our target antigens, sM2 and CTA1, were displayed on the surface of Lactobacillus casei. the oral or intranasal administration of recombinant L. casei induced systemic and mucosal immune responses that have the potential to protect against lethal challenges of divergent influenza subtypes. 2 groups received 1010 CFU of pgsA-sM2/L. casei or pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei. the remaining two groups received the same concentration of pKV-pgsA/L. casei or PBS in 100 l orally. narcosis-anesthetized mice were intranasally infected with 10 times the MLD50 of challenge viruses in 20 l of PBS. six mice in each group were sacrificed on 3 and 5 dpi to check virus titer in lungs. mice were humanely euthanized using CO2 inhalation for 5 minutes. a gene encoding the consensus sequence of M2 was generated. the sequences were synthesized and used as templates for the construction of the plasmids pgsA-sM2/L. casei and pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei. plasmids were transformed into pKV-pgsA-CTA1-sM2 competent cells. plasmids were confirmed by restriction endonuclease digestion and DNA sequencing. cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the rabbit anti-pgsA and rabbit anti-M2 antibodies used in this experiment were generated by the i.m. inoculation of KLH-conjugated pgsA or M2 peptide in rabbit. the membranes were reacted with a 110,000 dilution of anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (IgG HRP) ELISA antibody titers were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) using serum or mucosal samples from vaccinated mice. first, 96-well immunosorbent plates (Nunc) were incubated with 300 ng/well purified sM2 or CTA1 proteins at 4\u00b0C overnight. the wells were blocked with 10% skim milk for 2 hours in RT. vaccinated mice were isolated aseptically and added at 5104 cells/well. plates were treated with biotinylated anti-mouse IFN- and IL-4 antibodies. titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose. the viral titer of each sample was expressed as 50% tissue infected doses using the Reed-Muench method. tissues were fixed in 10% formalin containing neutral buffer. slides were stained using an antibody (rabbit anti-M2, 1500) the mice were managed with pelleted feed and tap water ad libitum. all efforts were made to minimize suffering following approval from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Bioleaders Corporation. avian influenza viruses A/EM/Korea/W149/06(H5N1), A/Puerto Rico/8/34(H1N1), A/Aquatic bird/Korea/W81/2005 (H5N2), A/Aquatic bird/Korea/W44/2005(H7N3), and A/Chicken/Korea/116/2004(H9N2) used in this study. mice from one set were humanely euthanized using CO2 inhalation. all the survived mice were humanely euthanized for 5 minutes. all challenge tests were conducted inside an approved BSL-3+ facility. modified genes were ligated into the T Easy Vector (Invitrogen, Seoul, Korea) genes were then digested with Kpn I-Sal I for sM2 and BamH I-Kpn I for CTA1. the digested sM2 was ligated to the plasmid vector pKV-pgsA-CTA1-sM2. 6,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C followed by washing two times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline. cell wall and cytoplasmic fractions were separated by centrifugation at 12,000g for 20 minutes at 4\u00b0C for 2 hours. recombinant L. casei were grown in 30\u00b0C for 48 hours in the MRS broth. bacteria were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000g for 10 minutes at 4\u00b0C. washed three times with sterile phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.01% Tween-20. cells were treated with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. goat anti-mouse IgG HRP (11000, sigma) or anti-mouse IgA was added to each well and incubated for an additional 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. after another round of washing, the plates were reacted with the substrate solution containing tetramethylbenzidine and H2O2. after adding the stop solution 2N-H2SO4, the optical density was measured at 450nm using an ELISA autoreader. the lungs were collected aseptically, and virus titers were determined by 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) the titer of each sample was expressed as 50% tissue infected doses. slides were stained using an immunoperoxidase method with an antibody (rabbit anti-M2, 1500) directed against the matrix protein-2 of influenza A virus. a Goat-anti-rabbit IgG HRP (12000, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) was used as the secondary antibody. west blot analysis of recombinant pgsA-sM2/L. casei and pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei expression using anti-pgsA (top), anti-M2 (middle) and anti-CT (bottom) polyclonal antibodies. Lanes 1 and 2 show pgsA-sM2 and pgsA-CTA1-sM2 respectively. mice were grouped as mentioned in materials and methods and received oral or nasal administrations. pgsA/L. casei, pgsA-sM2/L. casei or pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei cells were immunized. samples from the lungs and intestines were collected at day 28. fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunofluorescence labeling of the cells were used to verify the localization of the fusion pgsA-sM2 and pgsA-CTA1-sM2 protein on the surface of L. casei. recombinant bacteria harboring pgsA-sM2 or pgsA-CTA1-sM2 immunostained positive for sM2 and CTA1 but this was not found as a negative control, mice were immunized with L. casei harboring the parental plasmid pKV-pgsA (pgsA/L. casei) and PBS. comparatively low levels of serum IgG were detected both in the i.n. and orally immunized group. the absorbance of the IgG antibodies specific to the sM2 protein in the lungs and intestines in the intranasal (top) and oral (bottom) groups. serum IgG, lung IgA and intestinal IgA were investigated by ELISA and measured at an absorbance of 450nm. splenocytes from vaccinated mice were stimulated with 10 g/ml of recombinant sM2 protein or M2 peptide. cells from the mice immunized i.n. with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei showed significant levels of IFN- in response to stimulation with either sM2 protein or M2 peptide. highly conserved sM2 can induce M2-specific IFN- and IL-4 secreting T cell responses, while mucosal delivery through CTA1 conjugation with sM2 enhanced the cell mediated immunity. splenocytes were stimulated with sM2 proteins and M2 peptides of the intranasally and orally immunized groups. viruses used in this study contain 0\u20138 mismatched amino acids. mice immunized orally with pgsA-sM2/L. casei and pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei showed 40 and 60% protection respectively. none of the unimmunized mice survived after lethal infection. five-week-old female BALB/c mice (5 per group) were vaccinated with PBS, pgsA/L. casei, pgsA-sM2/L. casei or pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei. mice were infected with 10 LD50 of mouse-adapted divergent influenza subtypes. mice vaccinated with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei exhibited a higher level of protection than orally immunized groups. mice immunized by the i.n route exhibited a higher level of protection than orally immunized groups. mice immunized with pgsA-sM2/L. casei lost up to 40% of their body weight. mice immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei lost approximately 10% of their body weight. mice immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei lost approximately 10% of their body weight. mice immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei showed higher protection efficacies. mice immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei showed lower morbidity than mice immunized with pgsA-sM2/L. casei. body weight and survival were observed for 13 dpi. mice were immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei and challenged with the H5N2, H1N1, H9N2, or H7N3 influenza subtypes. mice were sacrificed randomly from each group, and their lung virus titers were measured using the TCID50 method. titers in lung tissues were determined by TCID50 in the MDCK cell line at 3 and 5 dpi after challenge with divergent influenza subtypes. reduced number of viral antigen were detected in lungs of mice vaccinated with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei or control revealed features of severe pneumonitis. the asterisk indicates a significant difference between pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei and other groups. at 5 dpi, lungs were randomly collected from each group of one set, fixed and stained with eosin before being examined under a light microscope. casei showed no remarkable pulmonary inflammation compare to the pgsA-sM2/L. casei-treated mice. sM2 and pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei Vaccination induced long-lasting cross protection. sM2 vaccine conferred protection against a lethal infection 6 months after the final immunization. ELISA was performed in triplicate using the coated sM2 protein to confirm the long-lasting antibody levels of both IgG and IgA. Mice were challenged with lethal doses of A/Aquatic bird/Korea/W81/2005(H5N2) virus 6 months after the final vaccination. gsA-expressing vector was used to construct plasmids containing the highly conserved consensus sM2 gene. plasmids were transformed into L. casei cells. expression levels of pgsA-sM2 and pgsA-CTA1-sM2 were monitored by immunoblotting using anti-pgsA, anti-M2 or anti-CT polyclonal antibodies. the cells were reacted with either rabbit anti-sM2 or anti-CT antibodies. the cells were treated with anti-M2 or anti-CT and then FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibodies. the mice were grouped as mentioned in materials and methods. pgsA-sM2 and pgsA-CTA1-sM2 fusion proteins were detected by anti-pgsA, anti-M2 or anti-CT polyclonal antibodies in the membrane. bands representing the size of the fused proteins pgsA-sM2 and pgsA-CTA1-sM2 were detected, while during the reactions with anti-M2 or anti-CT antibodies, no other bands were detected. inant L. casei could effectively display the sM2 and CTA1-sM2 fusion proteins on the surface, using pgsA as a membrane anchor protein. a preliminary experiment was conducted to determine the doses and schedule of pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei vaccine candidate. a significant level of anti-CTA1 antibodies was detected in both the nasal and oral vaccinations. the nasally immunized group showed higher levels of serum IgG specific to both sM2 and CTA1. mice were immunized orally or intranasally with pgsA/L. casei. pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei induced significantly increased levels of sM2-specific mucosal IgA compared to the pgsA-sM2/L. casei and control groups. however, as expected, higher levels of antibody titers were detected at the site of inoculation than at the remote site. pgsA-sM2/L. casei and pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei showed detectable levels of IL-4 secreting splenocytes following stimulation with either sM2 protein or M2 peptide. iFN- and IL-4 secreting cells were also observed in mice immunized orally with pgsA/L. casei. pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei and PC denote negative controls. PC denotes positive controls, the cells stimulated with mitogen. asterisk indicates significant difference between pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei and other groups. mice that received i.n. immunization with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L lost 20% of their initial body weight. mice that received i.n. immunization with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L recovered by day 13. five-week-old female mice (5 per group) were vaccinated with pgsA/L. casei, pgsA-sM2/L. casei or pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei at 0 to 3, 7 to 9 and 21 days i.n. or 0 to 3, 7 to 9 and 21 to 23 days orally. Vaccinated mice were infected i.n. with 10 LD50 of mouse- sets of vaccinated mice were challenged with 10 MLD50 of the H1N1 virus. mice immunized by the i.n route showed a significantly higher level of protection compared to mice immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei. mice immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei showed lower morbidity than mice immunized with pgsA-sM2/L. casei. none of the unimmunized mice survived, whereas 100% and 80% of the mice immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei via the i.n. and oral routes survived. unimmunized mice lost as much as 30% of their body weight than mice immunized with pgsA-sM2/L. casei and pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei. mice immunized with pgsA-sM2/L. casei through the i.n route showed significantly higher level of protection against the H7N3 influenza virus than the other groups. reduced viral replication at 5 dpi compared to mice immunized with pgsA-sM2/L. casei or the control groups at the same time. reduced viral titers in the lungs were observed in groups of mice immunized via the i.n route relative to the mice immunized via the oral route. these reduced titers may be due to routes of vaccination and challenge being the same. reduced number of viral antigen were detected in lungs of mice vaccinated with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei or control mice. both showed features of severe pneumonitis with increase virus antigen. mice immunized with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei developed immune responses that are strong enough to inhibit virus replication. pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei Vaccination induced long-lasting cross protection. -sM2/L. casei showed negligible body weight loss, which was recovered by 13 dpi. 80% survived in the i.n. immunized group, 60% survived in the orally immunized group. sM2 mucosal vaccine conferred protection against a lethal infection 6 months after the final vaccination. pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei was significantly better protected than PBS, pgsA/L. casei, pgsA-sM2/L. casei after lethal challenge with A/Aquatic bird/Korea/W81/2005(H5N2) the mucosal immune system is the first immunological barrier against the pathogens that invade the body via the mucosal surface. sM2 of consensus sequence has 0\u20138 mismatches among the subtypes used in this study. extracellular domain particularly (aa, 1-13) is highly conserved among the influenza virus subtypes. sM2 of consensus sequence has 0\u20138 mismatches among the subtypes used in this study. CTA1 retains adjuvant function of CT without its toxic side effects. it has been reported that the consensus sM2 fragment may induce broad protective immunity against divergent subtypes of influenza virus. pgsA gene used in this study is an anchor for display on surface of LAB. vaccination with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei was able to induce a significantly higher level of sM2-specific serum IgG (Fig. 2A and B) and mucosal IgA (Fig. 2C and D) compared to pgsA-sM2/L. casei. i.n. administration was superior to the oral route of vaccination, which is consistent with other observations. the cellular immune response plays an important role in controlling viral replication. we examined the Th1-type (IFN-) and Th2-type (IL-4) responses by the ELISPOT assay. significantly higher levels of IFN- were detected in response to stimulation with both the sM2 protein and M2 peptide. we evaluated the immunogenicity of the recombinant LAB vaccine on the basis of other parameters, such as the reduction of pathological lesions and virus shedding. in this study, low titers of the challenge virus were titrated from the lungs after vaccination with pgsA-CTA1-sM2/L. casei. recombinant L. casei expressing consensus sM2 mucosal vaccine may be a promising vaccine candidate for influenza pandemic preparedness."}
