{"summary": "patients with AGWs suffer both physical (burning, bleeding, itching and pain) and psychosocial stress (anxiety, decreased self-esteem, and negative emotional and sexual impact) the recurrence of AGWs is common, with the rate ranging from 6% to 77%. the administration of HPV vaccines containing HPV 6 and 11 antigens is the highly effective approach for preventing AGWs. a significant decline in diagnosed AGWs at the population level has been reported in Australia,16, 17 Denmark18, 19, 20 and the united states. a recent ecological study in England has shown a reduction in the rates of AGW diagnoses in males and females. biopsy samples were obtained to be tested for HPV DNA. kits tested for 13 oncogenic HPV types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59 and 68) and 3 non-oncogenic HPV types (HPV 6, 11 and 66) the cases were diagnosed according to the Diagnostic Criteria and Principles of Management of Condyloma Acuminatum (WS235\u20132003) the data of AGWs in Liuzhou City from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2015 from the NNDRS were analyzed. the national surveillance system The incidence rates of AGWs by sex were calculated by using the total number of cases during the annual period divided by the local annual population at the time at risk. the annual percentage change (APC) was used to express the trends, and the Z-test was used to assess whether the APC was significantly different from zero. biopsy samples were obtained to be tested for HPV DNA. kits tested for 13 oncogenic HPV types (HPV 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56,

attend three scheduled visits at 6-month intervals for 1 year to investigate the natural history of AGWs. the national surveillance system monitors 36 notifiable and non-notifiable diseases in china.

Liuzhou City from 1 January 2006 to 31 December 2015 from the NNDRS were analyzed. participants who were free of AGWs at baseline and who had at least one follow-up visit were included in the analysis. the national surveillance system The incidence rates of AGWs by sex were calculated by using the total number of cases during the annual period divided by the local annual population at the time at risk. the annual percentage change (APC) was used to express the trends, and the Z-test was used to assess whether the APC was significantly different from zero. the proportion of volunteers who had self-reported AGWs during a lifetime was also estimated. based on the age at first diagnosis of AGWs, the Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to calculate the cumulative age-specific incidence. and the full cohort were comparable for most of the demographic and behavioral characteristics, excluding birth cohort and marital status. the full cohort were comparable for most of the demographic

STD diagnosis the average age-specified incidence rate of AGWs was highest for 20\u201324-year-old females. the rate peaked at a slightly older age of 25\u201329 years in males. most of the AGW cases in the NNDRS were reported from the People\u2019s Hospital and the Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital of Liuzhou. 17% of the AGW cases were reported to the NNDRS. the missing report rate can probably be explained by the following factors. patients with AGWs may not seek health care or select private clinics. 20\u201325-year-old females and 25\u201330-year-old males had the highest incidence rate. this may be due to sexual mixing patterns, where younger women tended to have sex with older men. females had a shorter incubation period of HPV 6 or 11 than men. study may underestimate the incidence of AGWs in men. the incidence of AGWs in china is as high as that in developed countries. the data based on the national surveillance system seriously underestimate the real disease burden."}
