{"summary": "bovine coronavirus (BCoV) belongs to a family of microbes that is etiologically associated with enteric and respiratory disease across a wide range of mammalian and avian species. the role of BCoV in the bovine respiratory disease complex (BRDC) has been controversial, and the recent increased application of molecular diagnostics to BRDC cases has further muddied the waters. coronaviruses are spherical to pleomorphic enveloped RNA viruses. they have distinctive club-shaped 20-nm peplomers or \u201cspikes\u201d protruding uniformly from the envelope. coronaviruses are spherical to pleomorphic enveloped RNA viruses (1\u20135) the larger spike is a heterodimeric glycoprotein comprising 2 subunits, S1 and S2 (1,2,5). it interacts with sialic acid-containing receptors on the target cell membrane. it is involved in fusing infected cells; it contains epitopes that are targets for antibodies. coronaviruses are in the Order Nidovirales (from the Latin nidus, nest) which refers to their complex replicative scheme, involving \u201cnests\u201d of subgenomic RNAs (1). first, part of the +stranded RNA genome acts as messenger RNA for the synthesis of an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. this enzyme guides cellular machinery in the cytoplasm of the infected cell to transcribe a full length the relative ease and low cost of sequencing, together with the discovery of more coronaviruses, have complicated the taxonomy of coronaviruses. these viruses are currently divided into 4 genera based on the partial nucleotide sequences of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase: alpha, beta (contains 4 subgroups A to D), gamma, and delta. reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-based methods have largely supplanted culture in identifying BCoV in clinical samples. the increased sensitivity, however, could lead to false positives in the likely case that a certain threshold of viral growth is necessary. high antibody titers to BCoV, most likely resulting from exposure prior to weaning, can have a respiratory disease-sparing effect. the data do not rule out that calves with a broad range of immunological experience may have less BRD simply because they also have antibodies and other immune responses to the pathogen(s) which is the true cause of the observed disease. in the last decade, 1 investigation of outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in intensively reared beef calves showed a series of good quality gross and histological lesions. this included tracheal petechiation, mucopurulent discharge and bronchointerstitial pneumonia with intra-bronchiolar syncytial cells in an affected airway. there was no apparent attempt to directly associate BCoV with the histological lesions. bovine coronavirus-positive epithelial cells were demonstrated in nasal turbinates and/or tracheas of 11 of 12 infected calves. there was no associated inflammation reported or evident in pictures of immunohistochemically stained tissues. no BCoV was similarly identified in lungs of any calf. all calves developed diarrhea of variable severity and duration. there was no examination of any tissues from the respiratory tract to determine sites of infection. authors did not exclude the possibility of some inhalation of the inocula during administration. two studies reported reproduction of some level of respiratory disease (47\u201349) 7 ( 7-day-old) calves, 5 CD, 2 colostrum fed, were infected with a tracheal-organ culture supernatant containing BCoV. a few scattered areas of atelectasis were observed in lungs of 3 calves; changes in tracheas and nasal turbinates were not reported. there were no images of lesions or immunological staining during the attempts to reproduce respiratory disease with inocula containing BCoV. this unintended outcome provides some of the best evidence of the still-debated idea that the BCoVs that cause enteric and respiratory disease in cattle are the same. in the trachea, BCoV infection has been associated with mild clinical signs consistent with tracheal disease. this infection has apparently not been associated with severe clinical tracheitis and extensive necrotizing, so-called \u201cstove-pipe\u201d lesions. in the trachea, BCoV has been associated with mild clinical signs consistent with tracheal disease. the first study implicating BCoV as a respiratory pathogen (10) provided evidence of this probable necessity and alluded to the problem of reproducing disease with a monoculture of BCoV. this difficulty in reproducing dramatic respiratory disease is also an impediment to having a BCoV vaccine with a label claim for respiratory disease from a regulatory perspective. mebus et al (6) observed a corona-like virus in diarrheic feces and conducted transmission experiments in gnotobiotic calves. they then cultured the virus, determined which cell types would support growth, attenuated the virus, and performed initial protection experiments (7). in the next decade BCoV was recognized as a common cause of calfhood diarrhea (8). coronaviruses are spherical to pleomorphic enveloped RNA viruses (1\u20135) they have distinctive club-shaped 20-nm peplomers or \u201cspikes\u201d protruding uniformly from the envelope. some coronaviruses, including BCoV, have a secondary fringe of smaller 5-nm spikes (1\u20135) a group of 4 to 8 (depending on the particular coronavirus) nonstructural \u201caccessory\u201d proteins have been best characterized in the emergent bat coronaviruses, but have not been thoroughly examined in BCoV. a major function of these proteins is to inhibit innate (interferon) responses. coronaviruses were divided into 3 groups based on genetic and serologic properties. group 1 included feline infectious peritonitis virus and transmissible gastroenteritis virus, and lacked the hemaglutinin-esterase. group 2 included BCoV and the human \"cold\" virus, and had the HE. Isolation of BCoV in cell culture can be problematic because it is fastidious. the latter usually preferentially grow in primary or very low passage cell cultures. reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR-based methods have largely supplanted culture. qPCR has been used in a small number of calves to correlate amount of nasal shedding with transmissibility. no direct link was found, but this study suffered the confounding variable of developing immunity. more data correlating BCoV load with disease would be an obvious theoretical and practical advancement. the presence of a microbe in nasal secretions and other respiratory samples has long been taken as evidence of pathogenicity/causality in BRD cases. the presence of a microbe in nasal secretions has long been taken as evidence of pathogenicity/causality in BRD cases. shedding has been documented in the absence of other recognized, or tested for, respiratory pathogens (27,28), and more frequently as an apparent co-conspirator with other respiratory pathogens in clinical specimens (18,22,27\u201331). the presence of BCoV in the nasal secretions of healthy cattle does not necessarily mean it is a pathogen, based on presence alone. titers on entry to feedlot or other situations of exposure are less likely to develop the BRDC. vaccination before entry to feedlot and/or antibody titers > 20 were associated with decreased risk of treatment for BRDC. in the absence of specific etiologic diagnosis, preferably visualization of BCoV in lesions may indicate an association and not a causal relationship. in the last decade, 1 investigation of outbreaks of acute respiratory disease in intensively reared beef calves showed a series of good quality gross and histological lesions. these included tracheal petechiation together with mucopurulent discharge and bronchointerstitial pneumonia with intra-bronchiolar syncytial cells in an affected airway. there was no apparent attempt to directly associate BCoV with the histological lesions. bovine coronavirus-infected nasal and/or tracheal epithelial cells were detected in 16 of the 18 calves. colostrum-deprived calves developed diarrhea by 2 to 4 d after infection. none had clinical signs of respiratory disease. 1 CD calf was mock infected with 40 mL of uninfected HRT-18 cell culture supernatant. despite the report of no clinical signs of respiratory disease in the infected calves, there were significant lesions described throughout the respiratory tract. there was associated interstitial pneumonia and hyperplasia of type II pneumocytes. bovine coronavirus positive cells were visualized by immunofluorescence in the lungs of 2 calves. no histological examination of respiratory organs was reported. this was the result of a draconian, unnatural challenge method involving both intranasal and transtracheal inoculation of 10 mL of supernatant. it is not known why respiratory disease caused by BCoV has been so difficult to reproduce. it could involve strain differences, host factors, or environmental co-factors. this may be as conceptually and practically simple as how the BCoV inoculum is propagated. trachea has been associated with mild clinical signs consistent with tracheal disease. this infection has apparently not been associated with severe clinical tracheitis and extensive necrotizing, so-called \"stove-pipe\" lesions. the first study implicating BCoV as a respiratory pathogen (10) provided evidence of this probable necessity. vaccines for the 2 recognized paramyxoviral respiratory pathogens of cattle, BRSV and bovine parainfluenza virus-3 (BPIV-3) were in the case of BRSV (51), and are in the case of BPIV-3 (52), licensed on the basis, essentially, of reduced nasal shedding (of the viruses) alone."}
