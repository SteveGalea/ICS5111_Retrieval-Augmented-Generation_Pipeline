{"summary": "bovine coronavirus (BCV) is associated with respiratory infections in cattle of all ages. however, a temporal study to evaluate the effect of BCV immunity on virus shedding and bovine respiratory disease (BRD) incidence in pre-weaned beef calves has not been reported. the role of antibodies in protection must still be further defined. an ELISA for the detection of total reactive antibodies against BCV was compared with the VNT using 60 plasma or serum samples."}
