{"summary": "the isolation and characterization of the Ab repertoire produced by antigen-specific B cells has acquired a central importance in the last decade. both memory B cells (MBCs) and plasmablasts (peaking at day 8 after vaccination) have been used to generate naturally derived antigen-specific mAbs. most studies on HCMV have focused on the viral glycoproteins gB or gHgL as targets of NAbs. by screening mAbs from an immune donor based on their capacity to neutralize infection in vitro, a panel of potent NAbs was identified. a pentamer-based vaccine was reported to elicit very high NAb titers in mice. RSV-specific human B cells transduced with Bcl-6 and Bcl-xL were used as a source to identify Abs that effectively neutralized the virus. the most potent NAbs recognize the prefusion form of the F antigen, suggesting that the prefusion protein could be considered as the most effective vaccine antigen. cloning and expression of human mAbs could be achieved through the recovery of the Ig sequences from single B cells derived from the bone marrow and blood of healthy donors. cloning and expression of human mAbs could be achieved through the recovery of the Ig sequences from single B cells. novel recombinant and soluble HIV-1 envelope proteins have been used as baits to identify and capture Env (gp160)\u2013specific B cells. single-cell Ab cloning techniques have successfully generated hundreds of HIV-specific Abs and, among them, dozens of new extremely potent next-generation bNAbs. a modified high-throughput approach has been developed based on isolation of PBMCs and expansion in vitro without the need for activated T cell supernatants. the main advantage of this technique is provided by the possibility of directly characterizing the Abs produced by individually cloned B cells without the need for cloning and expression of all the recombinant mAbs. new antigen can be developed with the best formulation or delivery system to then be tested in humans. the figure was inspired by Fig. 3 from an earlier paper (Burton, 2002) one approach is to computationally search the total repertoire data for ab sequences that are shared among individuals exposed to the same antigen through infection or vaccination. only a small subset of Abs are usually expressed and investigated after the exhaustive interrogation of the repertoire. the anti-TT serum IgG repertoire is composed of a limited number of Ab clonotypes (80\u2013100), whereas the B cell receptor repertoire diversity in the memory and plasmablast compartments is orders of magnitude greater than that of the serological repertoire (Lavinder et al., 2014). this observation suggests that most peripheral B cell\u2013encoded Abs are unlikely to be present in detectable amounts as soluble proteins. mAb b12 required up to 25 g/ml for neutralization of most HIV strains in the united states. in more recent analyses, b12 neutralized only 30\u201360% of diverse HIV strains. findings again led researchers to believe that Ab-based therapies and vaccines would be useless for HIV control. the ability to use single-cell technologies allowed for identification of several hundred anti-HIV human mAbs. some were bNAbs with a median IC50 as low as 0.02 g/ml, >1,000-fold better than the recombinant b12 Ab isolated in 1994. the new Abs also showed remarkable therapeutic effects in vivo. the immunological and structural information available is being used to design vaccine antigens. the emerging class of recombinant Env SOSIP (soluble gp140 stabilized by disulphide bridges and by an Ile to Pro mutation) immunogens stabilized in native-like conformations and able to induce NAbs against neutralization-resistant (tier 2) HIV. initial attempts to design an immunogen comprised of a scaffold protein presenting this F epitope with the observed helix-turn-helix conformation were only partially successful. after immunization, conformation-specific anti-F Abs were elicited but lacked the ability to neutralize RSV. however, careful manipulations to properly present a structurally optimized form of a single well-defined protective epitope resulted in the generation of the desired immune response. the trimeric F protein of RSV undergoes a major conformational change from a relatively compact meta-stable prefusion state to a more elongated highly stable postfusion state. the spontaneous conversion of recombinant prefusion F to the post-fusion state discouraged initial efforts in this direction. a new prefusion antigen was able to elicit much higher levels of RSV-neutralizing activity compared with the postfusion F antigen in mouse and NHP models. this work provides an elegant preclinical demonstration of the feasibility of a structure-based vaccine strategy driven by the analysis of the human protective immune response. a vaccine containing a prefusion-stabilized F protein would induce a response protective against RSV infection in humans. the circulating flu strains match the HA in the vaccine strains. this is because the latter circulates among avian populations. there is the risk that zoonosis to humans may trigger a deadly pandemic infection. a universally protective flu vaccine should generate high titers of bNAbs. the native HA is a meta-stable membrane glycoprotein that undergoes large conformational changes. the HA\u2013ferritin polypeptide spontaneously self-assembled into 24-mer nanoparticles. each displaying eight trimeric H1 subtype HA \u201cspikes\u201d projecting off the ferritin nanoparticle scaffold. this elegant multivalent immunogen presenting structurally intact HA trimers was effective in eliciting higher titers of NAbs compared with the identification of human mAbs able to bind conserved epitopes can be considered the first step toward the discovery of an ideal immunogen for a universal flu vaccine. these Abs are precious tools that can be used both for cocrystal structure studies to precisely identify the neutralizing epitopes in the HA stem region and for binding assays to isolate the most appropriate immunogen. new structural studies by x-ray crystallography and cryoelectron microscopy informed an iterative design pathway that resulted in seven generations of H1 subtype HA-stabilized stem immunogens. the last designed form presenting the desired trimeric structure and the epitope recognized by the broadly neutralizing human mAbs. a lead candidate, mini-HA #4900, raised broad and protective immune responses, completely protecting mice in lethal heterologous and heterosubtypic challenge models. this immunogen elicited higher Ab titers against homologous as well as heterologous and heterosubtypic strains that bound HA in the stem-neutralizing epitope and triggered potent Ab-dependent cellular cytotoxicity activity. mAb b12 from a combinatorial Fab phage display library was shown to neutralize 50\u201375% of primary HIV isolates tested. mAb b12 showed a very limited effect in controlling viremia in vivo, even when combined with 4E10, a distinct bNAb with similar potency. two more potent human mAbs targeting a broadly neutralizing epitope were described as able to neutralize 70\u201380% of the tested HIV strains with an IC50 50 g/ml and 50\u201360% with an IC50 1 g/ml. one of them was found able to neutralize up to 90% of HIV isolates at an IC50 50 g/ml and 70% at an IC50 1 g/ml. the new Abs also showed remarkable therapeutic effects in vivo. in rhesus monkeys chronically infected with pathogenic simian\u2013human immunodeficiency virus SHIV-SF162P3 they were able to rapidly reduce plasma viremia to undetectable levels. the quest for an RSV vaccine has met many challenges that have inspired research breakthroughs. the quest for an RSV vaccine has met many

RSV. a new structure-based approach for the computational design and optimization of improved biophysically robust scaffold proteins. the prefusion structure was an obvious candidate vaccine antigen. but the spontaneous conversion of recombinant prefusion F to the post-fusion state discouraged initial efforts in this direction. an alternative study by magro et al. (2012) found that Abs targeting the prefusion F protein accounted for most of the RSV-neutralizing activity. the study provides an elegant preclinical demonstration of the feasibility of a structure-based vaccine strategy. a vaccine containing a prefusion-stabilized F protein would induce a response protective against RSV infection in humans. human immunology is in the search for broadly protective vaccine antigens to protect against influenza. a universal flu vaccine should ideally induce an immune response against one or more conserved epitopes in the viral proteins to prevent infection or disease from all or nearly all possible circulating strains of the flu virus. the HA stem region is highly conserved among different strains and subtypes of influenza virus, but this region is poorly immunogenic when in the full-length HA protein contained in conventional flu vaccines. mer nanoparticles exhibited eight trimeric H1 subtype HA \u201cspikes\u201d projecting off the ferritin nanoparticle scaffold. this multivalent immunogen presenting structurally intact HA trimers was effective in eliciting higher titers of NAbs compared with a similarly adjuvanted trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) in both mice and ferrets, providing broader coverage against unmatched H1N1 viruses. two groups have taken advantage of such anti\u2013HA stem Abs and epitope mapping information to rationally design and screen novel immunogens. the design strategy was driven by prior human immunology studies and detailed structural knowledge that showed that the immunogenically subdominant stem region of HA contains highly conserved protective conformational epitopes recognized by human mAbs. recombinant antigen was fused to ferritin. it assembled on nanoparticle surfaces (termed H1-SS-np) which were confirmed to possess the desired antigenic features. in preclinical studies, H1-SS-np induced a higher Ab response against the HA stem compared with the classical trivalent inactivated flu vaccine. compared with TIV, this immunogen elicited higher Ab titers against homologous and heterosubtypic strains that bound HA in the stem-neutralizing epitope. however, the capacity of lead mini-HA candidates to reduce fever in NHPs after sublethal challenge with a heterologous H1N1 strain was only comparable to that of TIV. however, no reduction of tracheal viral load could be observed in mini-HA\u2013immunized rare, naturally occurring anti-Env bNAbs are characterized by a large number of somatic mutations arising from multiple rounds of selection. it was then found that germline Ab precursors of these HIV bNAbs have only very low affinity for most of the native heterologous Env variants. an alternative step-wise vaccination strategy has been proposed based on priming with an engineered antigen designed to target the germline precursors of HIV bNAbs. the selected protein, eOD-GT6, was fused to a linker from a bacterial lumazine synthase to allow the formation of a 60-mer virus-like protein nanoparticle. eOD-GT8 was able to expand B cells expressing human transgenic heavy chain combined to a mouse light chain with a five\u2013amino acids\u2013long CDR3 resembling naturally occurring light chains of human VRC01. ers triggered a robust cross-neutralizing Ab response through the selection of appropriate mouse light chains. they suggest that a germline targeting antigen should prime naive B cells encoding the germline precursors of HIV bNAbs. native-like HIV Env antigens are required to select and expand B cells expressing cross-neutralizing Abs."}
