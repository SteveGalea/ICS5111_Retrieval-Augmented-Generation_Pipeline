{"summary": "WT and Ifnar/ NK cells were cotransferred into Ly49H-deficient mice. NK cells are unable to recognize the virus-encoded glycoprotein m157 during MCMV infection. NK cells are unable to recognize the virus-encoded glycoprotein m157. WT and Ifnar/ NK cells were cotransferred into a Ly49H-deficient host. the percentage of surviving mice is shown for each group. the role of STAT1 in the NK cell response to MCMV infection was determined. WT and Stat1/ NK cells were cotransferred into a Ly49H-deficient host. CD27 versus CD11b and KLRG1 expression are shown for WT and Stat1/ NK cells at day 7 PI. Ifnar/ NK cells produced more IFN- than WT NK cells at day 1.5 PI. STAT1 phosphorylation was completely ablated in NK cells that cannot sense type I IFNs. findings demonstrate ability of type I IFNs to directly impact expression of key effector molecules in NK cells. Ifnar/ NK cells were unable to expand as robustly as their WT counterparts. mixed chimera-derived NK cells also showed a marked defect in expansion after MCMV infection. Ifnar/ NK cells proliferate normally but undergo greater apoptosis during viral infection. type I IFN protects NK cells from fratricide via perforin- and NKG2D-dependent mechanism. LCMV infection revealed a predominance of transferred WT NK cells. NKp46Cre R26DTA hosts revealed a higher percentage of Ifnar/ NK cells compared with WT NK cells after infection. type I IFN protects against perforin- and NKG2D-dependent NK cell fratricide during viral infection. NK cells from WT:Ifnar/ chimeric mice were labeled with CTV and transferred into WT or Ncr1gfp/gfp hosts followed by LCMV infection. bar graph shows percentages of transferred cells for each group in spleen at day 3 PI. NKp46 has been suggested to promote NK cell\u2013mediated killing of CD8+ T cells unable to sense type I IFNs. equal numbers of WT and Ifnar/ NK cells were cotransferred into WT and Ncr1gfp/gfp hosts infected with LCMV. LCMV infection of WT:Ifnar/ bone marrow chimeras, Ifnar/ NK cells expressed significantly higher amounts of NKG2D ligand. type I IFN acts to combat NK cell\u2013mediated fratricide that is dependent on NKG2D triggering. NK cells from WT:Ifnar/ chimeric mice were cotransferred into Rag2/ Il2rg/ hosts. Percentages of Ly49H+ NK cells in peripheral blood are shown for the indicated time points. naive naive WT or Ifnar/ NK cells were transferred into separate neonatal mice and then challenged with MCMV. all mice receiving WT NK cells succumbed to infection by day 15 postinfection. NK cells were cotransferred into a Ly49H-deficient host and infected with MCMV. Stat1/ NK cells exhibited a striking defect in expansion during the immune response to MCMV infection. NK cells have a defective expansion during MCMV infection. Ifnar/ NK cells produced more IFN- than WT NK cells at day 1.5 PI. STAT1 phosphorylation was completely ablated in NK cells that cannot sense type I IFNs. cells at day 1.5 PI are shown, and bar graph plots mean fluorescent intensity (MFI) per centages of Ly49H+ NK cells are shown. data are mean SEM and representative of three independent experiments with at least n = 3 biological replicates per condition. NK cells from WT:Ifnar/ chimeras were labeled with CTV. they were transferred into a Ly49H-deficient host and infected with MCMV. NK cells showed a modest increase in proliferation when compared with WT NK cells. type I IFN protects NK cells from fratricide via perforin- and NKG2D-dependent mechanism. LCMV infection elicits a strong type I IFN response. but does not drive the antigen-specific proliferation of Ly49H+ NK cells observed during MCMV infection. NKp46Cre R26DTA mice express the Cre recombinase under the control of the NKp46 promoter and possess a loxP-flanked stop cassette followed by a diphtheria toxin A. LCMV infection revealed a predominance of transferred WT NK cells compared with Ifnar/ NK cells. WT:Ifnar/ chimeric mice were directly infected with LCMV. expression of NKG2D ligands is shown at day 2 PI. equal numbers of WT and Ifnar/ NK cells were cotransferred into WT hosts that received a nondepleting neutralizing anti-NKG2D\u2013blocking antibody. however, in the PBS-treated control mice, a similar persistence between WT and Ifnar/ NK cells was observed. Ifnar/ (CD45.2) NK cells from mixed chimeric mice were transferred into Rag2/ Il2rg/ hosts. recipients mice were then infected with MCMV. Ifnar/ NK cells were nearly identical to WT NK cells. NK cells are known to provide a crucial line of early defense against viral infections in both humans and mice. in more recent years, NK cells have been described to possess many features of adaptive immunity. however, the molecular mechanisms behind these adaptive responses are not well understood. study demonstrates that type I IFN acts directly on NK cells to promote their long-term survival by protecting them from elimination via NK cell\u2013mediated fratricide. previous studies have found conflicting roles for type I IFN in the induction of NK cell proliferation after MCMV infection. Ifnar/ NK cells were found to undergo more apoptosis than WT NK cells. a perforin- and NKG2D-dependent fratricide mechanism plays a major role in the increased cell death observed in Ifnar/ NK cells during viral infection. further survival mechanisms may be lacking in these cells. Ifnar/ NK cells showed a modest reduction (15\u201330%) in MHC class I expression after MCMV infection. NK cells are known to tolerate target cells that express a wide range of MHC class I surface levels. rejection only occurs when target cell MHC class I expression falls below 20% of the host levels. the proinflammatory cytokine IL-12 and downstream signaling components STAT4 and Zbtb32 are critical for the clonal-like proliferation of Ly49H+ NK cells during MCMV infection. the expansion defect in Ifnar/ NK cells is nearly as pronounced as that of the Il12rb/ NK cells. inelli et al., 2011), B2m/ (Taconic), Rag2/Il2rg/ (Taconic), Ncr1gfp/gfp (Gazit et al., 2006), Prf1/ (The Jackson Laboratory), and R26DTA (The Jackson Laboratory). NKp46Crex R26DTA mice were generated at MSKCC. s, NK cells were labeled with 5-M CTV (Invitrogen) before transfer. labeling was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s protocol (Invitrogen) chimeric mice were infected by i.p. injections of 7.5 103 PFU of MCMV. newborn Ly49H-deficient mice were infected with 2 103 PFU of MCMV. LCMV infection was performed as described previously. NKp46Crex R26DTA mice were generated at MSKCC. mice used in adoptive transfer studies were infected with 7.5 103 PFU of MCMV. in vivo blockade of MCMV signaling was accomplished by injection of anti-NKG2D (clone CX5; 200 g/mouse) on day 0 of LCMV infection. blockade of NKG2D signaling was accomplished by i.p. injection of anti-NKG2D."}
