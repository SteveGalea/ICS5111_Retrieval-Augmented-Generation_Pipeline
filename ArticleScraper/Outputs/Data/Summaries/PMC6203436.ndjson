{"summary": "mRNA decay is a critical stage of gene expression that regulates the abundance and lifespan of cellular mRNAs. many viruses including alpha and gammaherpesviruses, influenza A virus, and SARS coronavirus accelerate host mRNA degradation through the use of viral proteins that trigger endonucleolytic cleavage of mRNAs in the cytoplasm. each of these viral proteins bypasses the rate-limiting deadenylation step of the basal accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA degradation does not lead to a compensatory increase in mRNA synthesis, as might be predicted by the homeostatic model. accelerated cytoplasmic mRNA degradation decreases cellular RNAPII promoter recruitment, thereby amplifying the restrictive gene expression environment. mammalian cells contain hundreds of RBPs that bind polyadenylated mature mRNAs. a new role for cytoplasmic poly(A) binding protein (PABPC) in mediating mRNA decay-driven repression of RNAPII promoter recruitment. mRNA levels exert significant influence on mRNA localization. results suggest select RBPs transmit mRNA abundance information from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to broadly influence gene expression. proteins from nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were labeled with isobaric tandem mass tags. three biological replicates of control, WT, and D219A muSOX expressing cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. trypsin-digested proteins from each fraction were differentially TMT labeled prior to LC/MS-MS. RNA binding proteins are translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus. 5994 total quantifiable nuclear proteins (detected in all replicates) 123 showed significant nuclear enrichment in WT muSOX expressing cells relative to the D219A mutant. these filtering steps yielded a final list of 67 proteins that were differentially enriched in the nucleus under conditions of accelerated mRNA decay. the binding state of poly(A) tail associated proteins could theoretically serve as a readout to distinguish the overall abundance of mRNA over other forms of RNA in the cytoplasm. however, nuclear relocalization of PABPC has been observed during infection with multiple viruses that promote mRNA decay. Xrn1 Xrn1 is the major 5\u20193\u2019 exonuclease in mammalian cells. it is responsible for the degradation of 3\u2019 RNA fragments generated upon cleavage by muSOX. muSOX-induced repression of RNAPII promoter occupancy does not occur. a total of 75 GFP-muSOX WT cells and 80 GFP-muSOX Xrn1 KO cells were counted. a total of 75 GFP-muSOX WT cells and 80 GFP-muSOX Xrn1 KO cells were counted. Western blots showing levels of Xrn1 or the GAPDH loading control in WT or Xrn1 KO HEK293T cells were subjected to ChIP using antibodies to RNAPII or IgG. Purified chromatin was quantified by qPCR. Xrn1 knockout leads to subcellular redistribution of proteins functionally associated with RNA. there were 149 and 158 proteins differentially expressed in the absence of Xrn1 in the nucleus or cytoplasm. both the oligosaccharyltransferase complex and RBPs were significantly overrepresented among the set of differentially expressed proteins in each compartment. Xrn1 knockout leads to subcellular redistribution of proteins functionally associated with RNA. the number of proteins that are differentially expressed in KO cells from the nucleus (149) and the cytoplasm (158) mRNA levels from WT and Xrn1 KO HEK293T cells were measured by RT-qPCR. Graphs display individual biological replicates as dots, with the mean and SEM. the majority of known Xrn1 protein partners were expressed at normal levels in the absence of Xrn1. this increase in GW182 abundance was independently validated by western blot analysis. we measured steady-state mRNA expression for each of these factors by RT-qPCR. in each case, the mRNA abundance was increased in Xrn1 knockout cells compared to WT cells. the GO term analysis examined the relocalization mechanism for one of the PABPC interacting proteins, LARP4. we reasoned that if LARP4 relocalization involved direct interactions with the nuclear import machinery then it should relocalize in muSOX-expressing cells in a PABPC independent manner. if it was \u2018escorted\u2019 into the nucleus via its interaction with PABPC, then its relocalization should be blocked by PABPC depletion PABPC depletion abrogates the muSOX-driven decrease in RNAPII promoter occupancy. we tested whether depletion of several of these factors individually altered RNAPII occupancy using chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. HEK293T cells treated with siRNAs targeting PABPC1 and 4 (A), LARP4 (B) or non-targeting scramble siRNAs were transfected with either empty vector or muSOX. Western blots showing protein levels of PABPC1, PABPC4 and Larp4 after siRNA depletion are shown in the lower panels. HEK293T cells were treated with siRNAs targeting CHD3 (A), MSI1 (B), or TRIM32 (C), or non-targeting scramble siRNAs. purified chromatin was quantified by qPCR. Western blots showing levels of CHD3 and MSI1 after siRNA depletion are shown below. RNAPII levels were further reduced in muSOX expressing cells after depletion of LARP4, MSI1, CHD3 and TRIM32. however, knockdown of these factors may lead to broad impacts on cellular function, in ways that directly or indirectly influence transcription. X-induced transcriptional repression was restored in Xrn1 knockout cells upon transfection of FLAG-PABPC1. nuclear translocation of this RBP plays a central role in connecting cytoplasmic mRNA decay to RNAPII promoter recruitment. mRNA decay-induced translocation of PABPC selectively impacts early stages of transcription. the level of Ser2P RNAPII was determined by dividing the Ser2P values over the total RNAPII values within the same region of the gene. ChIP was performed as described in (B), but using antibodies to the POLR3A subunit of RNAPIII or IgG. mRNA decay-induced PABPC1 translocation impacted RNAPII initiation or elongation in addition to promoter recruitment. mRNA decay-induced PABPC1 translocation impacted RNAPII initiation or elongation in addition to promoter recruitment. the primary defect is in promoter recruitment, and there are not independent impacts on downstream events. r occupancy by RNA polymerase III (RNAPIII) was unaltered in cells expressing muSOX or FLAG-PABPC1 compared to control cells. mRNA decay-driven nuclear accumulation of PABPC1 reduces PIC assembly selectively at the promoters of RNAPII transcribed genes. three biological replicates of control, WT, and D219A muSOX expressing cells were separated into nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. trypsin-digested proteins from each fraction were differentially TMT labeled prior to LC/MS-MS.

RNAPII levels were further reduced in muSOX expressing cells after depletion of LARP4, MSI1, CHD3 and TRIM32. we hypothesize that knockdown of these factors may lead to broad impacts on cellular function. however, PABPC appeared to be selectively involved in suppressing RNAPII occupancy during enhanced mRNA decay. muSOX-induced transcriptional repression was restored in Xrn1 knockout cells upon transfection of FLAG-PABPC1. nuclear translocation of PABPC plays a central role in connecting cytoplasmic mRNA decay to RNAPII promoter recruitment. mRNA decay-induced translocation of PABPC selectively impacts early stages of transcription. the level of Ser2P RNAPII was determined by dividing the Ser2P values over the total RNAPII values within the same region of the gene.

RNAPII levels are reduced at both promoters and in the gene body. a nuclear role for MSI1 has recently been uncovered during mouse spermatogenesis. in the cytoplasm, MSI1 negatively regulates the translation of its target RNAs by competing with eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G for binding to PABPC. this interaction promotes mRNA poly(A) tail lengthening and stabilization in the nucleus. in yeast it appears to operate as a compensatory mechanism to maintain optimal mRNA abundance. reduced mRNA decay results in reduced transcription, and vice versa. a unicellular eukaryote \u2018buffers\u2019 its overall gene expression for continued maintenance of the organism. ne stably expressing Cas9 alone with no guide RNA. ne stably expressing Cas9 alone with no guide RNA. antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-LYRIC Abcam ab124789 Western (1:1000) antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-RRBP1 Bethyl A303-996A-T Western (1:1000) antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-LIN28B Abcam ab71415 Western (1:1000) antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-PNN Life Technologies PA533172 Western (1:1000) antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-TRIM32 Abcam antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-RNAPII phospho S5 Abcam ab5131 ChIP (10 mg) Antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-POLR3A Abcam ab96328 ChIP (10 mg) Sequence-based reagent (H. sapiens) siPABPC4 PMID:20823266 Custom siRNA.

RNAPII levels are reduced at both promoters and in the gene body. a nuclear role for MSI1 has recently been uncovered during mouse spermatogenesis. in the cytoplasm, MSI1 negatively regulates the translation of its target RNAs by competing with eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4G for binding to PABPC. this interaction promotes mRNA poly(A) tail lengthening and stabilization in the nucleus. in yeast it appears to operate as a compensatory mechanism to maintain optimal mRNA abundance. reduced mRNA decay results in reduced transcription, and vice versa. a unicellular eukaryote \u2018buffers\u2019 its overall gene expression for continued maintenance of the organism. ne stably expressing Cas9 alone with no guide RNA. ne stably expressing Cas9 alone with no guide RNA. antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-LYRIC Abcam ab124789 Western (1:1000) antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-RRBP1 Bethyl A303-996A-T Western (1:1000) antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-LIN28B Abcam ab71415 Western (1:1000) antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-PNN Life Technologies PA533172 Western (1:1000) antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-TRIM32 Abcam antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-RNAPII phospho S5 Abcam ab5131 ChIP (10 mg) Antibody Rabbit polyclonal anti-POLR3A Abcam ab96328 ChIP (10 mg) Sequence-based reagent (H. sapiens) siPABPC4 PMID:20823266 Custom siRNA.
