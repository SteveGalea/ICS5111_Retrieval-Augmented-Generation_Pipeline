{"summary": "ser hydroxyl group is not strongly nucleophilic and enzymes must supply a general base to facilitate its deprotonation. the traditional residue for this role is His, although other residues are also used. evolution has selected for many different residues to activate the nucleophile. but the cooperative interactions that engender reactivity are effectively \u201ctuned\u201d differently for each individual enzyme. this principle was first tested by the chemical swapping of the hydroxyl nucleophile of subtilisin for a thiol and observing loss of proteolytic activity. ggered rotamers are denoted according to whether the OH is gauche or trans to its peptide NH. all but one clan of Ser proteases (23) use an amide NH flanking the nucleophile to stabilize the oxyanion hole. the identity of the oxyanion hole is not determined by the handedness of the catalytic triad. the molecular basis for this relationship is simple: only the backbone NH that is adjacent to the nucleophile can be used to facilitate catalysis. the rotamers of the -atom are named g+, g, or t. cat cat oxy Reference PA Elastase 3HGN Hemiketal g (43, 140) S-H-D N re 131 125 32 (68) SB Sedolisin 1GA4 Ester g (62, 24) S-E-D N re 147 108 18 (69) SE D-Ala-D-Ala peptidase 1MPL Phophonate g (72, 0) S-Y-K N re the only exception to this correlation is clan SH, which does not use the local oxyanion hole. we hypothesized that constraints introduced by the reactive rotamer and oxyanion hole combine to severely limit the catalytically viable location of the base. cat 116\u00b0 because the O of the nucleophile is sp3 hybridized during the concerted deprotonation and nucleophilic attack that initiates catalysis (27). this is inherent to proteolysis with Ser, all such proteases must converge on this geometry. cat is always negative for the si-face\u2013attacking enzymes. cat is always positive for the si-face\u2013attacking enzymes. only the g+ and t rotamers are used to support re-face attack. proteases of clan SH do not use the local backbone in oxyanion hole formation. they attack into the re face of the scissile bond and have cat and oxy values similar to those of other re-face attackers (23). this prompted us to consider whether some additional mechanistic factor might preclude alternative geometries. this important distinction from the Ser proteases allows the acid to be preorganized for protonation of the leaving group and not activation of the nucleophile. thiol of Cys is intrinsically more reactive than the hydroxyl of Ser and the structural constraints for efficient catalysis are less stringent.

Currently, efforts to develop new therapeutics are often focused on optimizing interactions within the binding pocket that are distinct from the catalytic center itself. acylation mechanism of a ser protease is shown in Fig. 1. evolution has selected for many different residues to activate the nucleophile. but cooperative interactions are effectively \u201ctuned\u201d differently for each individual enzyme. the extent of active site variation among different proteases has not been systematically explored. there are three staggered rotamers of Ser and they are denoted according to whether the OH is gauche or trans to its peptide NH. the identity of the oxyanion hole is not determined by the handedness of the catalytic triad, but is correlated with the reactive rotamer. the molecular basis for this relationship is simple: only the backbone NH that is adjacent to the nucleophile can be used to facilitate catalysis. oxyanion hole is a ser protease with each reactive rotamer. dashes represent hydrogen bonds between the nucleophile and the base and the protein backbone and substrate (orange) the identity of the reactive rotamer is tightly correlated with the location of the base, as indicated by cat. the only exception to this correlation is clan SH, which does not use the local oxyanion hole. a partial explanation may be attributed to the protein backbone flanking the nucleophile. a second constraint on the location of the base is the angle defined by the basic atom, nucleophile, and electrophile. cat is always negative for the g+ and t rotamers and negative for the grotamer. the location of the base is further defined by the requirements that |cat| > 90\u00b0 and cat 116\u00b0. cat > 90\u00b0 is predetermined for each reactive rotamer/oxyanion hole pair. the substrate carbonyl points toward the local backbone for stabilization with a local oxyanion hole. when cat > 90\u00b0, the opposite holds. only a re-face attack is viable for enzyme acylation and a si-face attack leads to an inactive complex. each of the 11 structurally characterized clans of Cys proteases uses the local oxyanion hole and |oxy| 90\u00b0. the relationship between the reactive rotamer and the face of attack is identical. thiol of Cys is intrinsically more reactive than the hydroxyl of Ser. the stereochemistry of catalysis is absolutely conserved. we report that divergent evolution may change the substrate specificity or the identity of the catalytic triad. members of clan CD do not use the same general base for activation of the nucleophile and protonation of the leaving group. the structure 2HWK crystallized with the base in an inactive state and 2WP7 has a ligand covalently bound to the nucleophile. a clash with a hypothetical -methyl was observed for all Ser proteases. evolution always selects against a Thr nucleophile in all clans of Ser proteases. a similar clash is observed for signal peptidase I with a -lactam inhibitor (PDB ID: 1B12). evidence clearly supports the use of a Thr nucleophile in a Thr-Tyr-Glu catalytic triad. removal of the phenolic OH of the Tyr base has a relatively small 100-fold reduction on kcat. however, removal of the phenolic OH of the Tyr base has a relatively small reduction on kcat. the proteasome -subunit (PS) was established as the first member of the \u201cThr proteases\u201d (11, 40, 41) the resultant Ntn harbors an -amine that acts as the proton transfer catalyst, analogous to the role played by His in the canonical catalytic triad. a thorough explanation of Ntn function should also account for the fact that mutational removal of the -methyl decreases the activity of PS (20) reactive rotamer effect (RRE) is a phenomenon known as the reactive rotamer effect. the -methyl accelerates catalysis by intrinsically favoring the reactive g rotamer. this is precisely the situation presented by ThrSer mutation of PS and related enzymes. the Thr -methyl shifts the rotamer distribution toward a reactive state, which increases kcat. these effects are intrinsic to Ntn structure and may contribute to the evolutionary selection of a Thr nucleophile. a g+ rotamer has a strong steric repulsion with the N 1 carbonyl. the nucleophile is always preceded by a -strand that leads into a helix. the nucleophile is always preceded by a -strand that leads into a helix. a reactive g+ rotamer has a loop at its N-terminal direction. a reactive g+ rotamer has a loop at its N-terminal direction. a reactive g+ rotamer has a loop at its N-terminal direction and a helix at it C-terminal end. the -lactam antibiotics inhibit penicillin-binding proteins responsible for the final cross-linking step in bacterial cell wall biosynthesis (59), a reaction that occurs through a re-face attack. a -lactam\u2013based SPase inhibitor was successfully generated when the bridgehead stereochemistry of a penicillin-like molecule was inverted. uralide features a -lactone\u2013-lactam core that occludes the re face of the eletrophilic carbonyl. this inhibitor scaffold is effective only against si-face\u2013attacking enzymes. similar properties may be attributed to the salinosporamides (63), vibralactone (64), and avibactam (65). we advocate division of proteases into two classes according to the stereochemistry of their nucleophilic attack. by understanding the active site constraints imparted by proteolysis through an acyl-enzyme mechanism, we accounted for the selection against a Thr nucleophile."}
