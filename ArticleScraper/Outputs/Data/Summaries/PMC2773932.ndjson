{"summary": "the fulminant atypical pneumonia emerged as a regional and global threat in 2002\u20132003 with a high mortality rate resulting from acute lung failure. the disease causing agent has been identified as a novel coronavirus termed as SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [2], [3]. the virus is an enveloped virus containing a single stranded, positive-sense RNA genome which encodes 14 putative open reading frames encoding bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) residing at the bronchoalveolar duct junction of adult lungs. these cells have been identified and characterized as CD34+ Sca-1+ CD45- PE-CAM cells expressing both cytoplasmic Clara cell secretion protein (CCSP) and prosurfactant protein-C proteins. miRNA-mediated RNA interference is reported to be an essential tool to understand the regulatory pathways at molecular level that underlie infection biology elucidation of miRNA-mediated regulatory mechanisms could provide new avenues to explore the underlying mechanisms of SARS infection. the entry of SARS-CoV into cells is mediated through interaction between spike (S) glycoprotein of the virus and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor of SARS-CoV on the host cell. the state of cell differentiation and ACE2 expression levels are important determinants of the susceptibility of human airway epithelia to infection. in this work, we have proposed the role of miRNA in modulating the expression of ACE2 along with the stage specific cellular differentiation at the site of infection initiation. we have tried to focus on the role of SARS-CoV which dictates these events for its successful transmission and replication. effective antiviral agent against SARS might unravel some of the effective therapeutic measures against the deadly disease in future. the entry of SARS-CoV into cells is mediated through interaction between spike (S) glycoprotein of the virus and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the primary receptor of SARS-CoV on the host cell. a small number of Oct-4-expressing cells have been observed at the bronchoalveolar junction of the neonatal lung. we have investigated miRNA-mediated modulatory role on Oct-4+ BASCs and have correlated their contribution to SARS infection. this study develops a complex interaction map between disease-related factors, miRNAs and BASCs in SARS disease pathway. describe the role of BASCs as the target cells of SARS infection. show how a repertoire of BASC miRNAs act as molecular switches to contribute to this host-pathogen interaction. avirus Sino1-11 AY485277 SARS coronavirus ShanghaiQXC2 AY463060 SARS coronavirus LLJ-2004 AY595412 Primary site of SARS infection Which is the primary site of SARS infection - is a pertinent question which prevails and is a debated issue. Sca-1+ CD34+ CD45 Pecam populations at BADJ are enriched for BASCs. clonal colony formation, these cells exhibited extensive self-renewal in culture. Oct-4+ colony cells (Sca-1+ CD34 SSEA-1+ cytokeratin+) are not the prime target cells for SARS-CoV infection. thereby, it is evident that these Oct-4 cells are not the prime target cells for SARS-CoV infection. miRNAs are widespread agents of post-transcriptional gene silencing. they exhibit a high degree of stage- and tissue-specificity. it is important to scan profiling data for those miRNAs that operate during the narrow windows of development of a SARS+ cell. significantly expressed mh\u2013miRNAs in bronchio-alveolar stem cells. mouse Accession No. miR-142-3p MIMAT0000155 MIMAT0000434 miR-19a MIMAT0000651 MIMAT0000073 miR-144 MIMAT0000156 MIMAT0000436 miR-374 MIMAT0003727 MIMAT0004955 miR-7a MIMAT0000677 MIMAT0000252 miR-186 MIMAT0000215 MIMAT0000456 MIMAT0000223 MIMAT0000459 miR-151-5p MIMAT0004536 MIMAT0004697 miR-93 MIMAT0000540 MIMAT0000093 miR-101b MIMAT0000616 MIMAT0000099 miR-127 MIMAT0000139 MIMAT0000446 miR-483 MIMAT0004782 MIMAT0004761 miR-574-5p MIMAT0004893 MIMAT0004795 miR-21 MIMAT0000530 MIMAT0000076 miR-200 MIMAT0003711 MIMAT0003711 MIMAT0003322 miR-210 MIMAT0000658 MIMAT0000267 miR-18a MIMAT0000528 MIMAT00072 miR-361 MIMAT0000704 MIMAT0000703 miR-152 MIMAT0000162 MIMAT0000438 miR-24 MIMAT0000219 MIMAT0000080 miR-148a MIMAT0000516 MIMAT0000243 let-7g MIMAT0000121 MIMAT0000414 miR-19b 143 MIMAT0000247 MIMAT0000435 miR-195 MIMAT0000225 MIMAT0000461 miR-145 MIMAT0000157 MIMAT0000437 let-7c MIMAT0000064 mh-miRNAs- mouse miRNAs having complete homology with human miRNAs. mh-miRNAs functions class A SCA1 (ATXN1) miR-101miR-19bmiR-200amiR-106amiR-93m class C ACE2 miR-186miR-93miR-200b Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is the primary receptor of SARS-CoV on the host cell. it is a negative regulator of the rennin-angiotensin system (RAS) in the setting of acute lung injury and in response to pulmonary infection. -574-5p and -214 targets all the four viral virulent proteins. miR-148a has its target in ORF1a, E, S and M respectively. miR-223 and miR-98 has an exclusive correlation with their targets within the 3\u2032 UTRs of N and S respectively. human infecting single-stranded RNA viruses are enriched for target sequences of human miRNAs. it is very likely that rapidly evolving virus take advantage of slowly evolving host miRNAs to increase their survival in the host. rapid mutation in SARS-CoV is supported by the fact that SARS-CoV lack proof reading activity in their polymerases. miRNA expression profiles of three miRNAs-17*, -574-5p and -214 targeting S, N, Orf1a, M and E show that they are upregulated within uninfected BASCs. the exclusive miRNAs viz. miR-223 and -98 for N and S protein respectively are highly downregulated (8.7 fold and 5.6 fold respectively) in host. RNA transcription and protein synthesis occurs in a SARS-CoV infected cells. the multifunctional protein plays pivotal roles in the biology and pathogenesis of SARS-CoV. it has been shown that S protein mediates viral infection by binding to cellular receptor ACE2 and thus induces membrane fusion. host miRNA and SARS-CoV interactions can explain the features of viral pathogenesis. this figure illustrates how the host miRNA and SARS-CoV interactions can explain the features of SARS-CoV pathogenesis. the role of S protein as a transcription factor has obliged us to think that they might play a role to activate the promoters of ACE2. the common miRNAs, miR-214,-574-5p and -17* have targets in N protein are upregulated in BASCs. but miR-223, the unique miRNA targeting N-protein is highly downregulated. this means that the N-protein targets corresponding to miR-223 is going to escape miRNA-mediated downregulation at the onset of infection. the expression levels of these inflammatory chemokines were increased by viral infection of the lung [33] it has been shown that CCR1 play an essential role in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis in lung-injury models. previous work suggests that antagonism of signaling via the chemokine receptor CCR1 is a potent strategy that attenuates leukocyte recruitment in response to severe respiratory virus infection. ARS-CoV encodes the target of miR-223 to escape the RNAi mediated silencing at the onset of infection. but the controlled expression of target CCR1 in an uninfected cell suggests that there must be a cascaded fine tuned interaction masterminded by the virus. it is known that N protein activates NF-KB in vero E6 cells. the proposed host miRNA-dependent mechanism acts in concert with the host and viral factors for establishing a strong infection. the proposed host miRNA-dependent mechanism probably acts in concert with the host and viral factors for establishing a strong infection. the proposed host miRNA-dependent mechanism probably acts in concert with the host and viral factors for establishing a strong infection. boosting the level of host virus-specific miRNAs could lead to viral replication. increasing the level of miRNAs exclusive for the N and S protein might also block viral entry. further silencing of miRNAs with antagomirs specifically within the infected cell could become another therapeutic strategy. the presence of SARS+ cells within multiple cell types makes it difficult to isolate SARS+ cells. some of the SARS+ cells remains overlapped with adjacent cytokeratin+ cells which might be mistakenly interpreted as colocalized cells. colony cells which are Sca-1+ CD34 SSEA-1+ cytokeratin+ were shown to be succeptible to SARS-CoV infection. cytokeratin+ cells do not express the functional receptor ACE2. phagocytosis is a common mode of virus entry within surrounding cells. miRNAs are widespread agents of post-transcriptional gene silencing. they exhibit a high degree of stage- and tissue-specificity. the virus exploits the host-miRNA milieu to foster their own agenda of evading the host immune system, thereby establish a consistent infection. the list of the miRNAs targeting the potential stage specific factors of BASCs has also elucidated the mh-miRNAs targeting ACE2. the target factors have further been mapped with the expression levels of their corresponding miRNAs within BASCs which shows their integrated correlation contributing towards each developmental stage of BASCs. miR-146b MIMAT0003475 MIMAT0002809 miR-20a MIMAT0000529 MIMAT00075 miR-301a MIMAT0000379 MIMAT0000688 miR-148b MIMAT0000580 MIMAT0000759 miR-15a MIMAT0000526 MIMAT0000068 miR-218 MIMAT0000663 MIMAT0000275 miR-17 MIMAT0000649 MIMAT0000070 miR-106b MIMAT0000386 MIMAT0000680 MIMAT0004825 MIMAT0004748 miR-17* MIMAT0000650 MIMAT00071 miR-671-5p MIMAT0003731 MIMAT0003880 miR-126-3p MIMAT0000138 MIMAT0000445 miR-125a-5p MIMAT0000135 MIMAT0000443 miR-92b MIMAT0004899 MIMAT0003218 let-7d MIMAT0000384 MIMAT0004484 miR-27a MIMAT0000537 MIMAT0000084 mi mh-miRNAs functions class A SCA1 (ATXN1) miR-101miR-19bmiR-200amiR-106miR-93miR-150 Stem Cell Antigen-1. it acts as a master switch in differentiation by regulating cells that have pluripotent potential. recently, it has been found to be expressed in pulmonary cells. class B SP-C (SFTPC) miR-331-3p Marker protein of alveolar type-2(AT2-like) cells which is a subset of the differentiated BASC population. Hence is quiescent in normal lung but proliferate in response to bronchiolar and alveolar epithelial injury [30], [31]. host miRNA targets in viral genome We have searched for the host miRNA targets within the virulent genes of SARS-CoV. miRNAs-17*, -574-5p and -214 targets all the four viral virulent proteins. miR-17*miR-223 promotes tissue fibrosis [19]N protein inhibit cell cycle progression [38], [39] ORF1a miR-574-5pmiR-214miR-17*miR-148a Encodes viral replicase proteins [40], [41]. RNA virus co-opt host-miRNAs to suppress their own replication. miRNA sequence conservation helps the virus to escape the antiviral effect of host-miRNAs after successful transmission within the host. miRNA expression profiles of three miRNAs-17*, -574-5p and -214 targeting S, N, Orf1a, M and E shows that they are upregulated within uninfected BASCs. interaction ACE2-S has been shown that proinflammatory and fibrogenic cytokine pathways are activated within the first 24\u201348 hr following pulmonary insult resulting from SARS-CoV infection. high initial levels of these activities are associated with persistent pulmonary damage and increased risks of subsequent pulmonary fibrosis. ACE2 mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity is severely decreased in pulmonary fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV infection. ANG II is a profibrotic peptide in an uninfected state. its target corresponding to highly downregulated miR-98 escapes miRNA-mediated host RNAi defense at the onset of infection and interferes with ACE2 expression. the question remains regarding the molecular mechanism by which this S-protein represses the expression of ACE2. miR-146b-5p is seen to target Oct-4 in normal BASCs. the downregulated expression of this miRNA explains for the uninterrupted expression of Oct-4 resulting its normal function in an infected cell. the common miRNAs, miR-214,-574-5p and -17* having targets in N protein are upregulated in BASCs. ACE2 mRNA, protein and enzymatic activity is severely decreased in pulmonary fibrosis resulting from SARS-CoV infection. studies have also been performed which support that differential regulation of host cell mRNA transcription and protein synthesis occurs in a SARS-CoV infected cells. onset of infection and interferes with ACE2 expression. the question remains regarding the molecular mechanism by which this S-protein represses the expression of ACE2. miRNAs are central to viral pathogenesis. the common miRNAs, miR-214,-574-5p and -17* have targets in N protein are upregulated in BASCs. but miR-223 the unique miRNA targeting N-protein is highly downregulated. this means that the N-protein targets corresponding to miR-223 is going to escape downregulation at the onset of infection. chemokine receptor CCR1 acts as receptors for CCL3 and CCL5. expression levels of inflammatory chemokines increased by viral infection of the lung. there has been a subsequent increase in inflammatory cytokines related to innate immune response in response to viral infection. miR-223 is known to promote granulocyte differentiation. it is a part of a regulatory loop that involves C/EBP and NFI-A. the virus encodes the target of miR-223 to escape the RNAi mediated silencing at the onset of infection. the proposed host miRNA-dependent mechanism acts in concert with the host and viral factors for establishing a strong infection. the proposed host miRNA-dependent mechanism probably acts in concert with the host and viral factors for establishing a strong infection. this will help us transform our knowledge from SARS to other emerging viral diseases. the potential therapeutic effect of modulating host-miRNA levels is also worth considering. this emerging picture of miRNA regulation in infected individual will make the host-virus interaction far richer and more complex than the crisp linear pathways of the previous decade. increasing the level of host virus-specific miRNAs would result in promotion of viral replication. the results represent a closer approach to mimic the molecular mechanisms that underlie disease pathway behaviors and response in a human host. further the overall miRNA expression profile of mouse and human lungs are similar. a maximum of only one GU base pair between 2 and 7 position of the miRNA is allowed. perfect seed pairing centered on nucleotides 2\u20137 is considered the most important criteria for prediction reliability. miRNAs with P-values below a critical P-value (typically 0.01) are the differentially detected signals and were selected as our global miRNA expression profile data set (of mouse BASCs) from the BASCGAP sequence data of 116 miRNAs. mRNA targets We have considered the developmental stage specific marker proteins of BASCs, which includes the transcription factor Pou5f1; ACE2-the most important receptor of SARS-CoV. annotated UTR sequences of the target genes were retrieved from UTRdb [63] for our investigation. miRNA\u2013mRNA enrichment analysis For bantam miRNAs, good minimum free energies (MFEs) can occur frequently by chance. the longer a putative target sequence, the better such random energies will be. consortium sequences to predict miRNA-mRNA pairs involved in SARS pathogenesis."}
