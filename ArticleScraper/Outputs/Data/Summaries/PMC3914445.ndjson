{"summary": "strains of highly multidrug resistant organisms (MDRO) have quadrupled in the past decade. this has other insidious negative repercussions including lengthening of hospital stay and increase in social and medical costs due to the emergence of MDRO. there are likely to be myriads of factors that contribute to rising tide of nosocomial infections. present proliferation of different strains of multidrug resistant organisms is limited to overuse in humans. there are no feasible strategies to reduce antibiotic-resistant organism from entering the food chain. the country is classified by the world bank as a \u201chigh-income economy\u201d among emerging economies. ESBLs from Oman have high resistance profiles against piperacillin/tazobactam and ciprofloxacin. other studies in the regions have also pointed out the emergence of multidrug resistant organisms. this study aims to address the monthly cumulative frequencies and prevalence rates of hospital-acquired multidrug resistant organisms during the year of 2012. it also aims to describe the distribution of hospital-acquired MDRO by site of infection and types of bacteria. the lowest prevalence rate was observed in June (4.0; 95% CI 2.0, 7.2), while the highest prevalence rate was observed in October (17.7; 95% CI 12.9, 23.9). results Table 1 shows the cumulative frequencies and rates of hospital-acquired MDRO among patients and isolates at SQUH, Oman, 2012. the prevalence rates of MDRO patients and isolates were relatively steady throughout the period from January to August 2012. in September, there was an abrupt increase in the prevalence rates which continuously elevated until the end of the year. Acinetobacter baumannii was the most prevalent MDRO among the isolates (32.4%). E. coli comes next with a percentage of 18.4% followed by methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL) the colonization of MDRO tends to have an unexpectedly high rate of morbidity and mortality. the social, economic, and medical cost of nosocomial infections mount to a huge financial cost. preliminary studies indicating that healthcare-associated infections constitute a global challenge in the GCC countries [27] increased prevalence of MDRO has been linked to antimicrobial use, inadequate antimicrobial therapy, and long antimicrobial exposures that may trigger emergence of resistance in a bacterium. there is strong evidence suggesting that contaminated healthcare workers' hands or environmental surfaces may play a role in exacerbating MDRO [30] MRSA, Klebsiella pneumonia, carbapenemase producing Gram-negatives, Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii. the most common MDRO were those related to Enterobacter species, Acinetobacter baumannii. a multisite study would be essential in order to lay groundwork for comparison between different healthcare settings. not all clinical specimens may represent active infections from the patients."}
