{"summary": "inappropriate antibiotic therapy in ambulatory care, especially for upper respiratory tract infections, has been cited to have a major influence on the occurrence of antibiotic resistance. a comprehensive search for relevant original articles and systematic reviews has been done with a focus on the situation prevailing in the region. the international classification of primary care (ICPC-2)3 provided the following rubrics for six clinical conditions that some researchers would consider as URTI. others limit the \u201cURTI\u201d only to presumed viral infection of the upper airways (rubric R74 in ICPC-2) in clinical practice, infections commonly affect two or more contiguous areas of the upper airways. shikh et al. reported a Streptococcus pyogenes isolation rate of 37% among children with pharyngitis and 12% among healthy children. none of the included studies were from the Asia-Pacific region. the isolation rates from the patients with URTIs vary from 0 to 28%. recent surveillance of Streptococcus pyogenes in the region revealed that the resistance of this bacterium to penicillin is non-existent but there is an increasing trend of resistance to erythromycin. the most frequently used clinical prediction rule is based on a combination of five features. rates for URTI in the Asia-Pacific countries are highly variable. the reported rates are not directly comparable between countries. the available prescribing data suggest antibiotic over-prescribing in many countries, particularly in china, Thailand and Korea. biotic choices: macrolide 61%, penicillin 36% (penicillin V 0.4%) new Zealand Kljakovic, 200543 246 GP clinics 335 61 10506 records from 246 GPs. in malaysia, it has been estimated that around 50% of all antibiotics used in primary care could be due to URTI. the effect was greatest in the month immediately after treatment but may persist up to 12 months. only a few Asia-Pacific countries have tested some of these interventions. none from Asia-Pacific region Point-of-care C-reactive protein testing Significantly reduced antibiotic prescribing. the systematic review by Faden et al.61 identified more than 60 studies from low and medium income countries assessing the impact of health insurance system on inappropriate medicine utilisation. there is still a paucity of evidence showing its positive impact on appropriate medicine utilisation."}
