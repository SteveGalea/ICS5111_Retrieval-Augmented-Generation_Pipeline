{"summary": "influenza is estimated to cause 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness and 250,000 to 500,000 deaths each year. 5%\u201310% of adults and 20%\u201330% of children are infected with the influenza virus worldwide. Vaccination is a cost-effective way to reduce the public health and economic impacts caused by influenza. study used four-year continuous surveillance data to compare influenza epidemiological and virological characteristics of influenza virus between ILI and SARI cases in Zhejiang province. the ILI surveillance in Zhejiang province was initially launched in 2001. as to 2009, the surveillance has expanded into 16 sentinel hospitals. a patient 5 years old is defined as having SARI if, upon or during admission, presenting with acute onset of cough or dyspnea. at least one of the following six signs or symptoms: tachypnea (respiratory rate >60/min for ages 2 months, respiratory rate >50/min for ages 2 to 12 months, and respiratory rate >40/min for ages 1 to 5 years) regional CDC laboratory tested influenza using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay following the standard protocols. Specimens tested as positive for influenza A were further tested for subtypes (i.e., A(H1N1), A(H3N2), A(H1N1)pdm09, and A(H7N9)) a two-sided p-value was considered statistically significant if found less than 0.05. for children aged under 15 years old, verbal consent was obtained from at least one parent or legal guardian. the definition of ILI is varied by ages. a patient 5 years old is defined as having SARI if, upon or during admission, presenting an acute onset of elevated temperature (axillary temperature 38 \u00b0C) and cough or sore throat, as well as tachypnea (respiratory rate 25/min) or dyspnea (difficulty breathing) swabs were required to collect from all of SARI cases and 5\u201315 ILI cases of each sentinel hospital on every week. a standardized case report form containing demographic and sample information was also required to complete among whose biological samples had been collected. seasonality and circulation of influenza types/subtypes among SARI and ILI cases were defined from week 11 to 21, 22 to 38, 39 to 48, and 49 to 10 of the next year respectively [22]. children aged 0\u20134 years old were the largest group of ILI and SARI patients. the median age of the tested patients was 15 years (IQR: 3\u201334) and the median age of the tested patients was significantly older than it of SARI patients (p 0.001). most identified influenza virus was influenza A virus (61.97% among ILI and SARI patients. most identified influenza virus was influenza A virus (61.97% among ILI and SARI patients) ILI, and 63.05% among SARI), followed by influenza B virus (37.92% among ILI, and 36.95% among SARI), mixed type virus (0.11% among ILI; 0.00% among SARI), with no statistical significance between the two groups. influenza virus was found in the specimen of 8601 of 52,293 (16.44%) all patients, with 8260 of 46,868 (17.62%) ILI patients and 341 of 5425 (6.06%) ILI cases were significantly higher than that among SARI cases across different groups of age, sex and season. the p-value is for the comparison of the influenza positivity between ILI and SARI patients across each stratum. the weekly number of samples tested has increased since the week 14 of year 2013. the weekly number of all ILI patients remained at similar level from year 2011 to 2014. the seasonal patterns of influenza virus were shown in Figure 5. The winter-spring peaks were observed in each study year for ILI. seven influenza viruses (five in the ILI group and two in the SARI group) were detected during the early year of 2014. the weekly percentage of influenza virus types/subtypes among all the identified influenza cases were significantly correlated between SARI and ILI patients. a total of 944,370 ILI and 5425 SARI cases were reported to Zhejiang province\u2019s surveillance system. age distributions shows that children aged 0\u20134 years old were the largest group of ILI and SARI cases. enrolled in the winter (34.14% for SARI versus 28.32% for ILI) than those of ILI patients (Table 1).

ILI percentage and ILI Influenza-Positive Rate, SARI percentage and SARI Influenza-Positive Rate Table 4 shows the results of Spearman correlation analysis among influenza virus positive rate and percentage of people with ILI or SARI. the percentage of ILI cases and ILI influenza-positive rate was statistically significantly the correlation between the weekly influenza positive rates and percentages of patients meeting the definition of ILI and SARI is higher among ILI patients than it among SARI patients. this difference might be caused by the different behaviors when a child or an adult is found to be sick. compared to adults, children are more likely to be taken to hospital, especially for SARI cases. the comparison between ILI patients and SARI patients shows no statistically significant difference in detecting influenza virus type and influenza A virus subtype. the correlation of weekly percentage of influenza virus type/subtypes accounted for all the positive numbers between SARI and ILI patients was corresponded. the findings are essential for planning influenza vaccination programmes for those severe cases given recommendations for strain inclusion within the vaccine are based on the ILI surveillance system. the detection rate of A(H7N9) virus in the SARI patients was higher than that in the ILI patients because this strain frequently cause severe syndromes. the rapid detection of emerging novel influenza strains or outbreaks of respiratory disease calls for other surveillance with standardized methodology [5]. identify the novel virus, detect pandemics at early stage, and then improve the understanding of the etiology of ILI and SARI."}
