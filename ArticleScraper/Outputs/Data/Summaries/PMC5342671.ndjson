{"summary": "herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 are among the most prevalent human pathogens worldwide. both HSV-1 and HSV-2 are neuroinvasive and become latent in neurons. some infected individuals experience sporadic viral reactivations. there is no cure or vaccine for HSV infection. the activation of the p38 MAP kinase cascade induced by these viruses facilitates the viral lytic cycle or serves as a defense mechanism of the host cells. the activation of the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway is considered universally important for viral infection or cell survival. this is the first report on the anti-viral activity of BX-795. this is the first report on the anti-viral activity of BX-795. this study may facilitate the identification of new anti-HSV targets. antibodies for gD-1/2, ICP0-1, ICP27-1, p65, p38, p-p38, ERK1/2, p-ERK1/2, JNK2, p-JNK1/2, c-Jun, p-c-Jun, GAPDH, -catenin and -actin and RIPA lysis buffer were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, USA). HSV-1 (HF) and HSV-2 (G) were propagated and titrated on Vero cells as previously described20. in vitro cytotoxicity of BX-795 was measured using a commercial CCK-8 kit. monolayers were seeded onto 10 mm glass coverslips in 24-well plates. the plate was rinsed with PBS-T buffer and immediately scanned by the LI-COR Odyssey Infrared Imager. the cells were then cultured for 24 h and treated with inhibitors. the cells were washed twice, exposed to the complete medium, and then frozen and thawed for three cycles. the viral titration was determined using the Vero-ICP10-promoter luciferase reporter system. cDNA was synthesized using a ReverTra Ace qPCR RT kit. Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS for Windows Release 18.0, SPSS Inc) Reagents, cell lines, plasmids and viruses LY294002, rapamycin, SB203580, SP600125, PD98059, BAY11-7082, phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA), pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) and MG132 were obtained from Pro antibodies for Akt, p-Akt and p-PI3K were obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, USA) antibodies for IB-, p-MKK4 and p-ATF-2 were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, USA). human TNF- was obtained from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, USA). 2104 cells per well were dispersed into 96-well plates. plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. cell viability was plotted as the percent viable cells. cell transfection and luciferase assay HEC-1-A, Vero or 293T cells were seeded into 96-well plates. when reaching 90% confluence, the cells were transiently transfected with 100 ng AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid alone or co-transfected with 50 ng NF-B or AP-1 luciferase reporter plasmid. real-time PCR was performed in triplicate on an ABI Prism 7300 Sequence Detection System using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO), according to the manufacturer's protocol. Statistical analysis was performed with a two-tailed Student t-test, using SPSS 18.0 software (SPSS for Windows Release 18.0, SPSS Inc). cytotoxicity BX-795, initially developed as a PDK1/TBK1 inhibitor, was used to investigate the effect of TBK1/IRF-3 and downstream factors on HSV-2 replication. we analyzed HSV glycoprotein D (gD) expression in the presence of serial concentrations of BX-795 in HEC-1-A cells. the same inhibitory activity of BX-795 was also demonstrated in Vero cells. the cells were treated with BX-795 prior to HSV-2 infection (moi=1) the virus was released by three freeze-thaw cycles of the infected cells. the viral titers were determined on vero-ICP10-promoter cells. the cytotoxicity of BX-795 was investigated on two cell lines used in the inhibitory activity analyses. confluent HEC-1-A cells were exposed to serial concentrations of BX-795 prior to infection with HSV-1 (moi=1). the levels of ICP0-1/2, ICP27-1/2 or gD-1/2 mRNA were quantified by qPCR analysis as described. BX-795 inhibited HSV replication but not through its PDK1 inhibitory activity. we analyzed whether BX-795 acts by inhibiting PDK1 activity. ly294002, a potent PI3K inhibitor, and rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, failed to exhibit any effect on HSV replication. BX-795 inhibition of HSV replication not mediated by its PDK1 inhibitory activity. HEC-1-A cells infected with HSV-2 (moi=1) were collected at the indicated time points and lysed. evidence has shown that JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways were also stimulated by HSV-1 infection. HSV-2 infection increased the phosphorylation of JNK and p38 but reduced ERK phosphorylation 8 h postinfection in human genital epithelial cells. gD expression was determined 24 h postinfection. BX-795 inhibited HSV-2-induced activation of JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways. c-Jun and p-ATF-2 were determined 12 h postinfection. AP-1 activity was determined by luciferase assay using an AP-1-luc reporter plasmid. the results indicated that only SB203580 and SP600125, but not PD98059, inhibited viral replication in both HEC-1-A and Vero cells in a dose-dependent manner. BX-795 inhibited AP-1 activation mediated by other stimuli was investigated. the effect of p38/JNK overexpression on viral replication is dependent. the results indicated that inhibition of HSV replication by BX-795 can be at least partially rescued by overexpression of p38/JNK. p38 MAP kinase acted upstream of JNK and p38, but not ERK. evidence has shown that HSV-1 infection leads to SEK1/MKK4 activation17. expression of ICP0 has been reported to stimulate intracellular AP-1 and NF-B activation37,38. BX-795 impeded HSV-1 and HSV-2 ICP0-induced AP-1 activation in HEC-1-A, Vero and 293T cells. but BX-795 did not inhibit ICP0-mediated NF-B activation. luciferase activities were measured 24 h post-treatment. HSV-1 infection causes persistent activation of NF-B. p65 translocation assay also confirmed that HSV-2 infection induced p65 nuclear translocation. HEC-1-A cells were either mock-infected or infected with HSV-2 (moi=1) in the presence of DMSO or BX-795 or PGA1. p65 translocation was determined by immunofluorescence assay 24 h postinfection. BX-795 inhibited HSV gD expression and viral replication. cytotoxicity of BX-795 was investigated on two cell lines used in inhibitory activity analyses. 80% of both cells remained viable at BX-795 concentrations up to 100 mol/L. effect of BX-795 on HSV immediate-early (IE) gene expression HSV lytic infection involves temporally regulated expression of three classes of viral genes. expression of IE genes, ICP0 (Figure 2A), ICP4 (Figure 2B) and ICP27 (Figure 2C) was significantly inhibited by BX-795 in a dose-dependent manner. the results were consistent with a decreased gD expression, which is a late gene product that is regulated by IE genes. cells were pretreated with BX-795, ICP0 and ICP27 mRNA transcription of HSV-1 and HSV-2 (Figure 2E) increased in a dose-dependent manner at an early stage of viral infection (6 h pi, particularly the enhancing effect for ICP0 at 6 h pi) BX-795 exhibited an inhibitory effect on the expression of not only these two IE genes but also on the late gene (gD) in a dose-dependent manner. ly294002, rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, failed to exhibit any effect on HSV replication. gD expression was minimally affected by even high concentrations of the inhibitors used. therefore, BX-795 does not seem to inhibit HSV-1 and HSV-2 replication through its anti-PDK1 activity. the experiment was carried out three times and the representative results are shown. BX-795 inhibition of HSV replication by blocking JNK/p38 pathway. evidence has shown that JNK and p38 MAP kinase pathways were also stimulated by HSV-1 infection. ERK, JNK, p38 MAP kinase, c-Jun and their phosphorylated forms and p-ATF-2 were determined by Western blot. confluent HEC-1-A cells were infected with HSV-2 (moi=1) in the presence of serial concentrations of SB203580, SP600125 or PD98059. ining 2 h post-treatment with PMA or 12 h post-infected with HSV-2. the cells were either mock-infected or infected with HSV-2. AP-1 activity was determined by luciferase assay. c-Jun nuclear translocation induced by both HSV-2 infection and PMA. it was also found that BX-795 inhibited AP-1 activation in a dose-dependent manner as determined by a luciferase assay using an AP-1-luc reporter plasmid. AP-1 activity was determined by BX-795 inhibition on HSV replication attenuated by overexpression of p38/JNK. gD-2, the phosphorylation level of p38 MAP kinase, JNK and their substrates were determined via Western blot. p-MKK4 was analyzed 12 h postinfection. BX-795 inhibited ICP0-mediated AP-1 activation. expression of ICP0 has been reported to stimulate intracellular AP-1 and NF-B activation. HEC-1-A cells were co-transfected with pcDNA3-ICP0-1/2-GFP or pcDNA3 and NF-B luc reporter plasmid. cells were either mock-treated or treated with BX-795 (25 mol/L), PDTC (10 g/mL), PGA1 (10 g/mL) or MG132 (20 mol/L) HEC-1-A cells were either mock-infected or infected with HSV-2 (moi=1) in the presence or absence of BX-795 or PGA1. p65 translocation was determined by immunofluorescence assay 24 h postinfection. BX-795 is a PDK1-inhibitory pyrimidine with an IC50 of 111 nmol/L in the cell-free system22. but the results with the specific PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, and an inhibitor of downstream mTOR, rapamycin, suggested that the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway did not affect viral late gene expression. the presence of SB203580 in HSV-1-infected cell culture attenuated 85%\u201390% virus yield11. the activation of JNK/p38 MAP kinase may stimulate viral gene transcription via downstream AP-1 activation. some HSV proteins are known to induce JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathways. the virion transactivator protein VP16 was both necessary and sufficient for the activation of JNK/p38 pathways even in the absence of any other viral context17. X-795 inhibited the JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathway by interfering with upstream MLK1-3. TBK1 is a kinase that activates IRF-3 and NF-B in the innate immune response48. BV13, encephalomyocarditis virus30, vaccinia virus31 and HBV/HCV15,16 have also been reported to activate JNK/p38 MAP kinase pathways. these pathways are important for viral replication7,27,28. the identification of the anti-HSV activity of BX-795 raises the possibility that BX-795 may also possess biological activity against other viruses."}
