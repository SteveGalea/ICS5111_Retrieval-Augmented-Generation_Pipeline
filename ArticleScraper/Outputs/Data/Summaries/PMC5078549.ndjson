{"summary": "global broiler meat production has shown a steady increase and is expected to overtake pig meat production in 2020. viral respiratory diseases are leading causes of economic losses in the poultry industry worldwide due to increased mortality. the most severe losses in terms of mortality are caused by very virulent viruses, mainly Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and avian influenza virus (AIV) (7\u20139) multiplex real-time RT-PCR (mRT-PCR) assays involve simultaneous amplification of more than one infectious agent, using more than one primer pair. the advantage of such mRT-PCR is that it eliminates the need for testing clinical samples separately for each virus. in the present study, we describe an established high-throughput assay facilitating reliable recognition of four avian respiratory viruses. we have designed and validated a rapid identification method combining one-tube multiplex RT-PCR with Luminex xMAP bead hybridization and detection technology to simultaneously identify four clinically important avian respiratory viruses. virulent pathotype of avian paramyxovirus-1 was isolated during an outbreak investigation in 1994. isolated virus was characterized as strain M41 based on cross-neutralization tests with type-specific antisera and partial S1 gene sequencing. virus belonged to low-pathogenic (LP) Eurasian lineage of AIV based on amino acid sequence of proteolytic cleavage site of hemagglutinin protein. throughput DNA suspension microarray assay was designed, allowing rapid and accurate detection and differentiation in a single test. quadruplex assay was adapted from previously published monoplex TaqMan real-time PCR assays targeting the matrix gene for AIV (20), the polymerase gene of NDV (19), the 5\u2032-untranslated region of IBV (28) and the infected cell protein 4 (ICP4) gene of ILTV (58) Luminex probes were synthesized with a 5\u2032-amino modification and a 12-carbon methylene linker. the primers and probes are listed in Table 1. Virus detection using monoplex real-time RT-PCR. real-time RT-PCR was performed on the Rotor-Gene Q system (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) with a one-step RT-PCR (AgPath-ID one-step RT-PCR reagents; Applied Biosystems) at 45\u00b0C for 10 min, initial denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 40 PCR cycles of denaturation of 95\u00b0C for 10 min, and annealing and extension at 60\u00b0 asymmetric PCR produces an excess of one of the strands. the amplicon was digested using the following reaction mixture. the reaction volume was 15 l using 13.2 l of PCR product, 1.5 l of 10 Lambda buffer and 3 units of Lambda exonuclease. the microspheres were washed by adding 0.5 ml of 0.02% Tween 20 and mixed gently by inverting the tube several times. the coupled beads were pelleted (8,000 g for 2 min) and resuspended to a concentration of 50,000 beads/l in Tris-EDTA (TE [pH 8.0]) buffer. about 40 l of supernatant was carefully discarded without destroying the pellet to eliminate unbound PCR products. the reaction plates were placed in a Luminex 200 instrument (Luminex Corporation, Austin, TX) at 55\u00b0C for bead enumeration and phycoerythrin fluorescence quantification. a positive signal was set as twice the MFI value of the background fluorescence NTC. the detection limit was defined as the dilution containing the fewest copies of viral genome that still gave a positive result for all replicates. the specificity of the assay was theoretically assessed by evaluating the primers and probes for relevant homologies using the BLAST tool. multiplex Luminex assay used time RT-PCR and MFI values. if = 0, there is no correlation between the two variables; if = 1 (or = 1), it was concluded that the two variables are perfectly proportionally correlated (or inversely proportionally correlated, respectively) strains used in the present study were characterized as follows. a virulent NDV strain was isolated from a laying hen flock. samples showed hemagglutinating activity were subjected to a conventional HI test. oligonucleotide probes for real-time RT-PCR and Luminex assays. target genes, amplicon sizes, labels, and sequences of primers and probes used in multiplex Luminex assay. primer and probe sequences were chosen after being thoroughly analyzed with the Premier Biosoft software. the software allowed the incorporation of existing proven primer and probe sequences together with new sequence targets. available options for predesign analyses, including melting temperature (Tm), G+C content, repeat run length, and variety of alignment rules were determined. all Luminex probes were synthesized with a 5\u2032-amino modification and a 12-carbon methylene linker (C12) for bead conjugation. one primer was labeled with biotin (Btn) and the other was phosphorylated on the 5\u2032 end (44). the primers and probes are listed in Table 1. primer concentration, annealing temperature, and DNA polymerase amount were optimized. all individual primer pairs allowed amplification of each of the four target viral genomes in a single PCR. all primer pairs were mixed together in a multiplex reaction. the beads were pelleted at 8,000 g for 2 min and resuspended in 50 l of 0.1 M 2-morpholinoethane sulfonic acid (pH 4.5) and aminated oligonucleotides (0.1 nmol) were added to the bead suspension. the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 30 min in the dark. bead stocks (50,000 beads/l) were diluted in 1.5 tetramethylammonium chloride (TMAC) hybridization buffer. 375 of each probe-coupled bead were present in each sample well. hybridization reactions were carried out in a total volume of 50 l/well. a positive signal was set as twice the MFI value of the NTC. the detection limit was defined as the dilution containing the fewest copies of viral genome that still gave a positive result for all replicates. triplicates of one mixture of dilutions of the DNA/RNA standards of the four virus strains were tested in three independent reactions over separate days. the variability of the MFI values was assessed by analysis of variance. positive samples categorized as positive, false positive (FP) was the number of negative samples categorized as negative. true negative (TN) was the number of negative samples categorized as negative. sensitivity of the Luminex DNA microarray system was investigated and compared to monoplex real-time RT-PCR. negative Spearman's values indicated that as CT values increase, MFI values decrease, meaning that the two variables are inversely proportional. b A minus sign in this column means that the value is greater than 40 and considered negative. biotin-labeled PCR products of the various viruses tested were hybridized with the multianalyte bead-based suspension array. all four avian respiratory viruses were detected using the multiplex DNA suspension microarray with 100% specificity.

DNA suspension array-based assay provides an alternative high-throughput molecular diagnostic platform for specific and sensitive detection of several major viruses commonly seen as important causes of viral respiratory diseases in poultry. the method is modular, and certain virus tests could be removed if the laboratory does not expect these avian viruses to be absent."}
