{"summary": "membrane remodeling is required for critical cellular processes including endocytosis, formation of multivesicular bodies, retrograde trafficking, and exosome formation. understanding the mechanisms of viral budding and the forces that drive this process would advance our fundamental understanding of viral lifecycles. the importance of preformed capsids in alphavirus assembly is of particular interest. the presence of a capsid in the particle is not necessary for production of infectious particles. the traditional view is that alphaviruses follow the preassembled NC budding pathway. we perform molecular dynamics simulations on a coarse-grained model for GPs, the NC, and a lipid bilayer membrane to elucidate the forces driving enveloped virus budding. the first set of simulations includes model GPs and a preassembled NC, thus allowing for NC-directed budding. in the presence of a preassembled NC, there is a threshold strength of NC-GP interactions above which pathways transition from GP-directed to NC-directed budding. in both pathways, assembly proceeds rapidly until budding is 2/3 complete, after which negative Gaussian curvature of the membrane at the neck of the bud imposes a barrier to subunit diffusion. trimers are modeled as rigid bodies comprising three cones. each cone is formed by six pseudoatoms of increasing diameter. each cone is represented by an array of six beads of increasing diameter. each cone consists of a linear array of six beads of increasing diameter. two nearby cones experience repulsive interactions, mediated by a repulsive lennard-Jones potential. each of the four inner beads experiences an attractive interaction with its counterpart in the neighboring subunit, modeled by a Morse potential depth gg. we model the nucleocapsid as an isotropic sphere of radius similar to that estimated from cryoelectron microscopy (CryoEM) experiments. complete NCs have significantly higher rigidity than lipid membranes or GP-coated vesicles. simulations in software HOOMD-blue, v. 1.3.1 (61) make use of GPUs to accelerate molecular simulations. we set the diameter of the lipid head as dhead =, so that considering a 5-nm-thick bilayer leads to 0.9 nm. model GPs are designed to roughly match triangular shape, dimensions, and aspect ratio of Sindbis virus GP trimers. each cone is represented by an array of six beads of increasing diameter, following the model described by Chen and Glotzer (51). membrane is represented by solvent-free model presented by Cooke et al. (52) nucleocapsid model Motivated by recent observation that alphavirus nucleocapsids do not require icosahedral symmetry (53) to be infectious, we model the NC as infinitely rigid. alphavirus GPs E1 and E2 are required for dimerization in the cytoplasm. it has been proposed that the GPs interconvert between assembly active and assembly active conformations. the two conformations have identical geometries, but only assembly active conformations experience attractive interactions to neighboring subunits. additional simulations performed to estimate parameter values and evaluate the effect of assumptions within the model. we estimated the membrane bending modulus mem as a function of interaction parameters by analyzing the membrane height-height fluctuation spectrum. to model NC-directed budding, we studied the same system, but initialized with an NC placed 7 nm below the membrane. we chose this initialization because within the NC-directed hypothesis the NC assembles completely in the endoplasmic reticulum and is transported by the secretory pathway to the budding site. assembly and membrane deformation proceed rapidly until the GP shell is 2/3 complete. the neck acts as a barrier that impedes subunit diffusion to the growing shell. the neck continues to narrow as additional GPs assemble until it becomes a tether connecting the bud and membrane. most frequent end-product obtained as a function of GP-GP interaction strength. bulk simulations exhibit shell assembly for gg > 0.97 at trimer concentration 3D = 3.4 105 3 (see Fig. S4 a, and see the Supporting Material), well below the effective concentration of trimers on the membrane 2Deff = 0.0013. a similar configuration was observed during simulations of assembly and budding of a 12-subunit capsid on a membrane (41), suggesting it is a generic feature of assembly and budding. however, assembly never proceeded past the partially assembled state for any parameter set on a homogeneous membrane. for stronger interactions, we observe complete budding. for ng 0.4, we observe an intermediate regime in which the NC promotes nucleation but fails to act as a perfect template. the result is an asymmetric shell that is partially attached to the NC; with a typical size of 95 subunits, it is smaller than a GP-particle but considerably larger than the intrinsic preferred shell size. Fig. S8 compares the total energetic contributions from GP-GP and NC-GP interactions for budded GPNC-particles. GP-GP interactions account for the majority of the attractive energy stabilizing the shell, with the NC-GP providing as little as 10\u201320% of the total energy. the theoretical prediction (Eq. 1) shows the average number of subunits in GP-shells as a function of GP-GP affinity, for GP-directed budding () and NC-directed budding with ng = 4.5 kBT. the data includes different sets of simulations in which either mem or shell is maintained constant. mem and shell are the membrane and shell bending moduli. the preferred GP-particle size is determined by the ratio mem/shell. only in the limit where the shell rigidity dominates, mem/shell 0, will GP-particles exhibit the size observed in bulk simulations. Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate that an NC can dramatically change the morphology of a GP shell by acting as a template over a broad range of interaction strengths. the observed monodispersity in GPNC-particles can be understood from Eq. 1 by noting that the NC is modeled as a perfectly rigid sphere. the relevance of this approximation to enveloped viruses is considered in the Conclusions. the endocytosis timescale is estimated from the time required for membrane receptors to diffuse to the enveloped particle (71, 72) the timescale for GPs to diffuse is given by l2/D, with Dsub = 2/0 as the GP diffusion constant in our simulations, and l 45 as the radius of the region around the budding site initially containing 80 trimers. assembly and membrane deformation proceed rapidly until the GP shell is 2/3 complete. the neck acts as a barrier that impedes subunit diffusion to the growing shell. the neck continues to narrow as additional GPs assemble until it becomes a tether connecting the bud and membrane. assembly in the absence of an NC is unfavorable. bulk simulations exhibit shell assembly for gg > 0.97 at trimer concentration 3D = 3.4 105 3. assembly and budding stalls at the constricted neck intermediate described above. a similar configuration was observed during simulations of assembly and budding of a 12-subunit capsid on a membrane (41), suggesting it is a generic feature of assembly and budding. however, assembly never proceeded past the partially assembled state for any parameter set on a homogeneous membrane. an NC allows assembly to occur at a lower gg as evidenced by obtaining complete shells even for gg as low as 0.9. these particles are usually not perfectly symmetric, containing 81\u201383 GP subunits. this result can be explained as in case of holey GP-particles described above. Fig. S8 compares the total energetic contributions from GP-GP and NC-GP interactions for budded GPNC-particles. GP-GP interactions account for the majority of the attractive energy stabilizing the shell. morphology of budded shells significantly differs between both mechanisms. given here is the average number of subunits in GP-shells as a function of GP-GP affinity, for GP-directed budding () and NC-directed budding with ng = 4.5 kBT. the solid green line gives the theoretical prediction (Eq. 1) for the estimated capsid rigidity shell = 25.66gg. n0 is the number of subunits in the equilibrium configuration in the absence of a membrane. mem and shell are the membrane and shell bending moduli. only in the limit where the shell rigidity dominates, mem/shell 0, will GP-particles exhibit the size observed in bulk simulations. Figs. 4 and 5 demonstrate that an NC can dramatically change the morphology of a GP shell by acting as a template over a broad range of interaction strengths. the observed monodispersity in GPNC-particles can be understood from Eq. 1 by noting that the NC is modeled as a perfectly rigid sphere in our simulations. mem/shell 0, will GP-particles exhibit the size observed in bulk simulations. this leads to a range of shell bending rigidities of 40\u2013250 kBT. this range coincides with bending rigidity values measured in AFM experiments on virus capsids. the NC is modeled as a perfectly rigid sphere in our simulations. it corresponds to the limit shell if it acts as a perfect template for the GP shell. comparing assembly dynamics in the presence of the NC can still reveal qualitative information about its effect on assembly timescales. this estimate yields 24000, which is reasonably close to the typical timescale for stage 1 observed in the simulations, 10000. the curved neck region imposes a barrier to subunit diffusion that increases as the particle nears completion. GP conformational changes avoid kinetic traps. the number of GPs in GP-particles (containing no NC) varies by >50% over the range of interaction parameters in which we observe successful budding. a variation of 5% for GPNC-particles (containing an NC) was qualitatively consistent with the simulation results. a recent study of herpes simplex virus nuclear egress complex (NEC) found that NEC particles budded in the absence of capsid are smaller than native viral particles (76) in our model, this observation would require that the intrinsic spontaneous curvature radius of the NEC complex is smaller than that of the capsid. most viruses actively drive scission by either recruiting host cell machinery, such as the ESCRT protein complex in the case of HIV (79), or encoding their own machinery, such as the M2 protein in Influenza (80). in alphaviruses specifically, the scission machinery has not been identified, though it is known that alphavirus budding is independent of ESCRT proteins (81). s are 10 times stiffer than bare membranes, mem/shell 0.1. the immature HIV particle consists of a gag polyprotein capsid. cleavage softens particles by an order of magnitude. budding identified by our results is variability of the budded particle size and morphology. the presence of the core directs the morphology of the particle, which may have direct consequences on particle stability during transmission and conformational changes that occur during particle entry into a new host cell. a recent study of herpes simplex virus nuclear egress complex (NEC) found that NEC particles budded in the absence of capsid are smaller than native viral particles (76) in our model, this observation would require that the intrinsic spontaneous curvature radius of the NEC complex is smaller than that of the capsid. spontaneous scission is a rare event because there is no ESCRT. most viruses actively drive scission by either recruiting host cell machinery. ESCRT-directed scission occurs before assembly completes, leaving 40% of the shell incomplete. matrix coats are 10 times stiffer than bare membranes, mem/shell 0.1. Kol et al. (55) investigated the effect of HIV maturation on its mechanical properties. all authors wrote the manuscript."}
