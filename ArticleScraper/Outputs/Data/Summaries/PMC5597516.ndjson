{"summary": "influenza vaccines are formulated, and annual vaccination is recommended by the CDC for everyone 6 mo or older for the 2016\u20132017 flu season. despite the availability of these seasonal vaccines, annual estimated mortality from 1977 to 2007 from influenza ranged from 3349 to 48,614 deaths. this was an unmet need in the 2014\u20132015 influenza season, in which the circulating influenza A (H3N2) strain was a drift variant of the seasonal vaccine strain. the cytosolic RNA helicase RIG-I has an important role in recognition. the protein NS1 is capable of antagonizing RIG-I-dependent signaling. NS1 is capable of antagonizing RIG-I\u2013dependent signaling. oxidized phospholipids, HMGB1, and S100A9 have all been shown to signal through TLR4 [16, 21, 22]. oxidized phospholipids, HMGB1, and HMGB1 have all been shown to signal through TLR4 [16, 21, 22]. the TLR4-specific antagonist Eritoran blocked lethality and clinical symptoms caused by PR8 infection. RCs can effectively prevent in vitro infection of human cell lines with either HIV [35, 38] or influenza A virus [39]. RCs are protective in vitro against HSV-1/2 through binding to its surface glycoprotein [40]. RCs may also have a key regulatory role in limiting tissue-damaging inflammation. the peptide was purified by reversed-phase HPLC to homogeneity (>98% purity) and verified by electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. the final product, shown in Supplemental Fig. 1, was analyzed by reversed-phase HPLC on a Waters (Milford, MA, USA). Rabbit-specific polyclonal Ab against RC-101 has been previously described. all other primary and secondary Abs used in the study have been previously described. peritoneal Ms were isolated from WT C57BL/6J (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, USA), TLR4/, TRIF/, and IRAK4KDKI. mouse and human Ms were matured from elutriated PBMCs of healthy donors as previously described. in vitro infection with PR8 was performed as previously described [20, 23] 1 g of total plasmid was mixed with SuperFect at a 1:7 ratio. cells were allowed to incubate in growth medium for 48 h before monitoring transgene expression. cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed. supernatants were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 10% gel and transferred to a polyvinyl difluoride membrane. beads were harvested by centrifugation and washed 5 times with binding buffer (0.1 M phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl; pH 7.2) mice were monitored daily for survival, clinical score, and weight loss. clinical scores ranging from 0 (no symptoms) to 5 (moribund) included piloerection, hunched posture, ruffled fur, audible lung crackling, and lethargy. the observed molecular mass of 1889.7 Da is within the experimental error of the expected value of 1890.4 Da. RC-101 was solubilized in PBS before use. mouse mAb were used to visualize TLR4 proteins with the tags FLAG and eCFP. the LAL Chromogenic Endotoxin Quantitation Kit (88282; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions to measure the ability of RC-101 to antagonize the biologic activity of LPS at doses higher than 1 EU/ml. mouse and human Ms were matured from elutriated PBMCs of healthy donors. in vitro infection with PR8 was performed as previously described. qRT-PCR reactions were monitored using the 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR system. cells were allowed to incubate in growth medium for 48 h before monitoring transgene expression. cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS and lysed (20 mM HEPES, 0.5% Triton X-100, 150 mM NaCl, and 1 mM PMSF) RC-101 were incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the presence or absence of excess, unlabeled E. coli K235 LPS. beads were harvested by centrifugation and washed 5 times with binding buffer. mice were euthanized as soon as they became moribund to prevent suffering of the animal. the numerical values obtained from those assays were analyzed with either a 1-way or 2-way ANOVA. survival curves of mice were analyzed with a log-rank test. IFN- is considered a MyD88-independent gene induced downstream of the TLR4\u2013TRIF pathway [56, 58] expression of those MyD88-dependent genes was analyzed. both LPS-dependent TNF- and IL-1 were inhibited by RC-101. the data represent the means sd for experimental conditions performed in duplicate. significance is compared with LPS treatment alone (0 g/ml RC-101) decreased LPS-dependent cytokine gene expression from RC-101 treatment correlated with a RC-101\u2013mediated block in activation-induced phosphorylation of the TLR4-proximal signaling elements. a representative blot from 3 independent experiments is shown. the biologic activity of LPS was measured in the LAL assay in the presence or absence of RC-101. the dose of LPS used in the cell-free LAL assay represents a 1000-fold lower dose of LPS than used for M TLR4 stimulation. RC-101 was recovered upon pulldown of biotinylated LPS with streptavidin beads. excess unlabeled LPS prevented the pulldown of RC-101 with biotinylated LPS. RC-101 is an antagonist of LPS biologic activity. RC-101, RC-101, and Pam3CSK4-biotin were incubated in the indicated combinations for 30 min before pulldown with streptavidin-coated beads. a representative pulldown from 3 independent experiments is shown. RC-101 fails to destabilize the ligand-independent TLR4 oligomerization in HEK293T cells. mouse Ms were stimulated with increasing doses of LPS for 60 min. arrow represents the dose of LPS used throughout the study. inhibition of signaling is not restricted to agonists that RC-101 can bind directly. RC-101 failed to inhibit cytokine gene induction in response to either recombinant TNF- or DMXAA. DMXAA is a potent inducer of TBK1-dependent IFN- in mouse Ms. RC-101 protects mice therapeutically from lethal infection with PR8. treatment of mice with other TLR4 antagonists, such as RC-101, may also protect against lethal influenza infection. HMGB1 is a DAMP that has been shown to be released during influenza infection in mice and humans [17, 18]. RC-101 suppressed cytokine gene induction in response to HMGB1. RC-101 suppressed cytokine gene induction in response to HMGB1. mice were infected with PR8 (LD90) and given 5 daily i.v. injections of RC-101. RC-101 treatment of mice also protected from PR8-induced lethality. this latter significant decrease in clinical symptoms suggests that RC-101 is not merely delaying the time to death because the survivors were typically healthy at the end of 2 wk. RC-101 inhibits TLR4-mediated cytokine expression in human and mouse Ms RTDs. we hypothesized that RC-101 would antagonize TLR4-mediated signaling. RC-101 inhibited LPS-induced IFN- in a dose-dependent manner. RC-101 inhibits TRIF- and MyD88-dependent cytokine gene expression in response to LPS stimulation. expression of IFN- mRNA (A and B), TNF- mRNA (C) and IL-1 mRNA (D) was determined by qRT-PCR. expression of the following human cytokines was determined using qRT-PCR. TBK1 phosphorylation remained decreased at 60 min after LPS treatment in the presence of RC-101. phosphorylation of MAPK and NF-B was increased at that time point. RC-101 blockade of TLR4 only delays signal transduction at that dose of LPS. dose of RC-101 represents a 1000-fold lower dose of LPS. RC-101 strongly inhibited the biologic activity of all LPS doses tested. RC-101 also inhibited the LAL activity of biotinylated LPS at doses ranging from 1 to 100 ng/ml. RC-101 is an antagonist of LPS biologic activity. Increasing doses of RC-101 were incubated with 1 endotoxin U/ml (0.1 ng/ml) of LPS for 10 min at 37\u00b0C. each dot represents the mean biologic activity calculated from 2 or 3 independent experiments. RC-101 fails to destabilize the ligand-independent TLR4 oligomerization in HEK293T cells. the arrow represents the dose of LPS used throughout the study. the data represent the means sd for experimental conditions performed in duplicate. whole-cell lysates were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted for transgene expression (input) or immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG\u2013specific Abs. Same as (C), except RC-101 (30 g/ml) was added where noted 30 min before harvesting of the whole-cell lysates. RC-101 inhibits TLR2 signaling but is not a global inhibitor of innate signaling pathways. expression of IFN- and TNF- at 30 min after DMXAA treatment or IL-1, and TNF- at 30 min after DMXAA treatment was determined by qRT-PCR. PR8-infected TRIF/ or IRAK4KDKI Ms induced similar amounts of IL-1 and TNF- mRNA in response to PR8. this suggests that the DAMPs that activate TLR4-dependent or other TLR-dependent signaling in vivo are likely not present in our in vitro model. peritoneal Ms from WT mice were stimulated with recombinant HMGB1 (2.5 g/ml) immediately after treatment with RC-101 (30 g/ml) or mock control. cells were harvested and analyzed for expression of IL-1 and TNF- mRNA. RC-101 treatment of mice also protected from PR8-induced lethality. this latter significant decrease in clinical symptoms suggests that RC-101 is not merely delaying the time to death because the survivors were typically healthy at the end of 2 wk. RC-101 and other -defensins are strong candidates for future human clinical trials. oxidative stress in the lung during PR8 infection has been linked to the development of oxidized phospholipids [20] and other DAMPs that mediate TLR4 signaling-dependent acute lung injury. mortality can be prevented by inhibiting oxidized phospholipid formation by administering the antioxidant N-acetyl cysteine [64] RC-101 could both bind LPS in in vitro pulldown assays and inhibit a broad range of LPS bioactivity in cell-free LAL assays. however, the dose of LPS used to stimulate Ms was in the saturation range, where only strong antagonists would be expected to have significant effect on cytokine gene expression. the MD-2 protein is a crucial part of the LPS recognition complex [68]. it is also possible that MD-2, and not TLR4, might be the primary target of RC-101 in this pathway. this suggests that RC-101 has the capacity to act in more ways than solely by ligand sequestration. secretion of proinflammatory genes at 24 h postinfection with PR8 has been shown to be MyD88-dependent in bone marrow\u2013derived and peritoneal Ms. but the difference in cytokine production mediated by a lack of MyD88-dependent signaling is not due to a defect in transcriptional up-regulation of myD88-dependent genes. RC-101 was tested in a mouse model of influenza infection. treatment with RC-101, starting 2 d postinfection, was shown to lessen severity of PR8-associated disease, resulting in a highly significant increase in survival. RC-101 could act in vivo, at least partially, through TLR4 antagonism. a mouse-adapted severe acute respiratory syndrome\u2013coronavirus limited the potentially overexuberant cytokine response occurring in the lung [77] AUTHORSHIP D.P. designed and coordinated the experiments in the study, performed and analyzed the experiments, and wrote the manuscript."}
