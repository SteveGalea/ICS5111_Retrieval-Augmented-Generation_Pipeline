{"summary": "the development of live vaccines using the food-grade lactic acid bacterium, Lactococcus lactis, is an attractive alternative and a safer vaccination strategy against B. abortus. despite the low secretion efficiency of GroEL, secretion seems to be the best way to achieve both production and protein yields. current brucellosis vaccines are composed of live attenuated B. abortus strains. most of them present major drawbacks that limit the control of brucellosis. they are pathogenic for humans; they cause abortion when administered to pregnant females; and (iii) they interfere with the diagnosis of infected animals. lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are promising candidates for the development of new, safe, mucosal vaccines. different from attenuated pathogenic bacteria, they are food-grade, non-invasive and non-pathogenic organisms. we have been particularly interested in the development of a new mucosal vaccine against brucellosis using the model LAB as a delivery vector. two expression vectors were initially constructed, pCYT:groEL and pSEC:groEL. pCYT:Nuc harbors a transcriptional fusion between the ribosome-binding site (RBSusp45) of the usp45 gene [37] and the DNA sequence encoding the mature part of the staphylococcal nuclease, NucB [38]. expression vector containing the fusion rbsUsp45::spUsp45::nucB under control of PnisA [34] pSEC:LEISS:Nuc pWV01/Cmr. plasmid containing the fusion rbsUsp45::spUsp45::LEISS::groEL, under the control of PnisA. the groEL gene was PCR amplified from pMal-GroEL. the oligonucleotides were: i) SCFgroEL for the coding strand: 5'- GGATGCATGCTGCAAAAGACGTA -3' in which the NsiI site is underlined. the resulting amplified product was treated with NsiI and EcoRI. plasmid constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. pCYT:groEL and pSEC:groEL were first obtained in E. coli TG1. all constructions were confirmed by DNA sequencing. lactococcal strains engineered to produce cytoplasmic protein forms had a reduced growth rate. lactococcal strains produced a secreted form of GroEL in the cytoplasm. analysis of induced and non-induced NZ(pSEC:groEL) cultures revealed only one band in the C fraction, with an expected size of 60 kDa. oEL may undergo rapid folding right after their synthesis. the secretion efficiency was estimated to be 3\u20135%. a similar effect was observed in a strain designed to produce a secreted form of bovine rotavirus nonstructural protein 4 (NSP4). induced L. lactis NZ9000 (pSEC:groEL) and (pSEC:LEISS:groEL) strains were prepared from cell (lanes C) and supernatant (lanes S) fractions and were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GroEL antibodies. the secreted GroEL seems not to be a target for the unique L. lactis housekeeping extracellular protease. synthetic propeptide LEISSTCDA (hereafter called LEISS) does not enhance secretion efficiency of GroEL Previous studies showed that the synthetic propeptide LEISSTCDA (hereafter called LEISS) can enhance SE of heterologous proteins in L. lactis. we examined whether LEISS could improve SE of heterologous proteins in L. lactis. two expression vectors were initially constructed, pCYT:groEL and pSEC:groEL. pCYT:Nuc harbors a transcriptional fusion between the ribosome-binding site (RBSusp45) of the usp45 gene [37] and the DNA sequence encoding the mature part of the staphylococcal nuclease, NucB [38]. expression vector containing the fusion rbsUsp45::spUsp45::LEISS::groEL, under the control of PnisA [34] pSEC:LEISS:Nuc pWV01/Cmr. plasmid containing the fusion rbsUsp45::spUsp45::LEISS::groEL, under the control of PnisA. the groEL gene was PCR amplified from pMal-GroEL. the oligonucleotides were: i) SCFgroEL for the coding strand: 5'- GGATGCATGCTGCAAAAGACGTA -3' in which the NsiI site is underlined. the resulting amplified product was treated with NsiI and EcoRI. pCYT:groEL and pSEC:groEL were first obtained in E. coli TG1. pCYT:groEL and pSEC:groEL were then transferred into L. lactis NZ9000. cloned in a foreign host, a chaperone may interact with the host proteins. lactococcal strains engineered to produce cytoplasmic protein forms had a reduced growth rate. lactococcal strains engineered to produce cytoplasmic protein forms had a reduced growth rate. the inefficiency in B. abortus GroEL secretion was previously reported by Leclerq et al. (2002; [17]) the ratio of mature protein secreted in the supernatant as a fraction of intracellular content was estimated to be 3\u20135%. isin-induced L. lactis NZ9000 (pSEC:groEL) and (pSEC:LEISS:groEL) strains were prepared from cell (lanes C) and supernatant (lanes S) fractions and were analyzed by Western blotting using anti-GroEL antibodies. the migration positions of precursor- and mature-GroEL forms are indicated by arrows. synthetic propeptide LEISSTCDA (hereafter called LEISS) does not enhance secretion efficiency of GroEL Previous studies showed that the synthetic propeptide LEISSTCDA (hereafter called LEISS) can enhance SE of heterologous proteins in L. lactis. we examined whether LEISS could improve SE of heterologous proteins in L. lactis. lactococcal strains produce a stable form of GroEL into the extracellular medium. despite concerns about the low SE of GroEL, secretion seems to be the best way to achieve both production and protein yields. this new strain has potential for oral immunization trials. plasmid constructions target the B. abortus GroEL either to the cytoplasm or to the extracellular medium. unless otherwise indicated, DNA restriction and modification enzymes were used as recommended by the suppliers. cultures were incubated for one hour before performing cell fractionation and protein extractions. protein samples were prepared from 2 ml of cultures, except for the introduction of protease inhibitors and mild precipitation procedures. plasmids pCYT:Nuc, pSEC:Nuc and pSEC:LEISS:Nuc were used to control expression of the B. abortus groEL. unless otherwise indicated, DNA restriction and modification enzymes were used as recommended by the suppliers. nisin promoter induction of recombinant strains harboring pCYT:groEL, pSEC:groEL or pSEC:LEISS:groEL. cultures were incubated for one hour before performing cell fractionation and protein extractions. 12 percent sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and Western blot, using anti-GroEL antibodies [17] were performed. blots were compared to known amounts of purified GroEL [38].
