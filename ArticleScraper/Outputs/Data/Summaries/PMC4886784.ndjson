{"summary": "interferon signaling drives the expression of multiple interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) which mediate viral clearance. ISGs can also be induced by other factors, including inflammatory stimuli such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-) (2). inflammatory responses are induced by and play a role in the control and clearance of multiple viral infections of the liver (10, 11) the association between liver macrophages and hepatocytes raises the question of how the hepatocytes react to the cytokines produced by the macrophages (and other inflammatory cells) inflammatory stimuli, e.g., endotoxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), have been shown to upregulate USP18 in peritoneal exudate macrophages. if similar stimuli lead to increased USP18 expression in hepatocytes, then this pathway could represent a novel link between inflammatory and innate immune responses. enhanced USP18 expression was associated with decreased IFN-stimulated expression of p-STAT1 and ISGs. hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury induced USP18 mRNA expression in liver and enhanced lymphocytic choriomeningitis replication. findings lend new knowledge to our understanding of how inflammation can modulate hepatic innate immune responses. mice between 6 and 8 weeks were used for experiments. mice were anesthetized by a 100-mg/kg intraperitoneal injection of pentobarbital. liver was then perfused with liver digestion medium. hepatocytes were plated at 106 cells/ml in DMEM with 10% FBS on a six-well plate for 4 h. the medium was replaced with serum-free DMEM supplemented with 20 nM insulin (Sigma), 5 g of transferrin (Sigma)/ml, and 100 nM dexamethasone (Sigma) cells were fixed, permeabilized, and stained with mouse anti-human USP18 polyclonal antibody (Abnova) the cells were acquired using a FACSCalibur cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) the experiments were repeated four times. a protein kinase inhibitor (31); a protein kinase kinase kinase inhibitor (32); a silibinin inhibitor (33); and wortmannin, a phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase inhibitor (34). the concentrations, sources, and main targets of these inhibitors are described in Table 1. the reverse transcription reactions of the extracted RNA were performed with a first-strand cDNA synthesis kit (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) according to the manufacturer's instructions, 1 g of extracted RNA was added in a total volume of 15 l of combined cDNA reaction reagents. mo sapiens IFN-2b (IFNA2b; AY255838) forward primer (5\u2032-GCTTGGGATGAGACCCTCTCCTA) and reverse primer (5\u2032-CCCACCCCCTGTATCACAC); homo sapiens actin, beta-like 2 (ACTBL2; NM_001017992) forward primer (5\u2032-GTCTGCCTTTTTTTTTTTTTTCTCT) hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) was simulated as before (35) control animals underwent anesthesia and laparotomy alone. mice were infected with 2 106 PFU of LCMV WE by intravenous tail vein injection. expression is upregulated by TNF- and LPS. RNA was harvested and real-time PCR was performed. error bars represent the standard errors of the mean (SEM) hepatic ischemia/reperfusion induces USP18 expression and enhances LCMV replication. a hepatic ischemia/reperfusion model was used to examine the in vivo effect of an inflammatory stimulus on USP18 expression. inflammatory stimuli included TNF- at 20 ng/ml (24) (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, MN), LPS from Escherichia coli at 100 ng/ml (25) (Sigma, Oakville, Ontario, Canada), IL-6 at 100 ng/ml (26) (Akron Biotech, Boca Raton, FL), IL-10 at 10 ng/ml (26) (Akron Biotech), and human IFN- at 100 IU the liver was then perfused with liver digestion medium (0.02% collagenase IV; Sigma) at the same pressure. the liver was then placed in DMEM and 20 nM insulin (Sigma) the cells were washed three times and viability was confirmed on a Vi-Cell XR 2.03. al anti-actin (Sigma) antibodies followed by anti-mouse or anti-rabbit IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA) an enhanced chemiluminescence detection kit was used to determine the levels of protein expression. primary mouse hepatocytes were incubated with the following inhibitors for 30 min prior to 6 h of stimulation with LPS or TNF-. the concentrations, sources, and main targets of these inhibitors are described in Table 1. RNA isolation and quantitative real-time PCR analysis were obtained from Sigma. total RNA was prepared from cells using the TRIzol reagent. mouse hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT; NM_013556) forward primer (5\u2032-TCAGTCAACGGGGGGGACATAAA) and reverse primer (5\u2032-GGGGCTCTCTTAACCAG); homo sapiens actin, beta-like 2 (ACTBL2; NM_001017992) forward primer (5\u2032-TCGGTAACTGACTTGAATGTCCA) real-time PCR conditions were as follows: 10 min at 95\u00b0C followed by 45 cycles of 15 s at 95\u00b0C and 15 s at 60\u00b0C monitor fluorescence in SYBR channel during a 60\u00b0C annealing/extension step. experimental hepatic ischemia/reperfusion injury (HIRI) was simulated as before (35). control animals underwent anesthesia and laparotomy alone. the impact of HIRI on LCMV replication was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey's post hoc test. the impact of HIRI on LCMV replication was evaluated by one-way analysis of variance with the Tukey's post hoc test. hepatic ischemia/reperfusion induces USP18 expression and enhances LCMV replication. mice were infected with 2 106 PFU of LCMV WE. RESULTS USP18 is induced in hepatocytes by LPS and TNF- but not by IL-6 and IL-10. we have previously shown that USP18 can modulate the type 1 IFN response (14) the degree of mRNA expression did not correlate completely with mRNA expression. inflammatory stimuli such as TNF- and LPS block IFN- signaling in hepatoma cells. the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of LPS (100 ng/ml) or TNF- (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. the cells were either left untreated or treated with IFN- (100 IU/ml) for 2 h. expression of pSTAT1, STAT1, and ISG15 conjugates was detected by Western blotting. knockdown of USP18 reversed this effect and augmented the effect of IFN-. the data from this experiment are consistent with those obtained with human hepatocytes. so, the ability of TNF- and LPS to block IFN signaling is seen in both primary and immortalized hepatocytes. to look at the role of USP18 in the IFN- refractory state induced by inflammatory stimuli, we examined the induction of STAT-1 phosphorylation. the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of IFN- for 6 h (IFN- Final) mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR and normalized to the expression of the HPRT housekeeping gene. mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR for 6 h. however, neither the presence nor the relative absence of ISG15 conjugation impacted the ability of TNF- and LPS to block IFN- signaling. results consistent with there being no role for ISGylation. expression of free ISG, ISG15 conjugates, UBE1L, and actin proteins measured by Western blotting. mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR and normalized to the expression of the HPRT housekeeping gene. primary murine hepatocytes were treated with IFN- (100U/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF- (20 ng/ml) for 6, 12,18, or 24 h. neither IFN-, LPS, nor TNF- induce much, if any, hepatocyte expression of IFN- or IFN-. ischemia/reperfusion induces USP18 expression and enhances LCMV replication. HIRI alone induced USP18 mRNA expression in whole livers by >10-fold that of untreated animals. in vivo liver inflammation leads to increased USP18 expression at the organ level. we preincubated primary mouse hepatocytes for 30 min with various inhibitors of LPS and TNF- signaling. we measured their impact on USP18 induction, while simultaneously measuring expression of proinflammatory cytokine IL-1 mRNA. however, only two inhibitors potently (>80%) inhibited USP18 expression as well as IL-1 mRNA expression in response to LPS stimulation. hepatocytes were stimulated with 100 U of IFN-/ml for 6 h. mRNA expression levels were evaluated by PCR and normalized to the HPRT housekeeping gene expression prior to determining the fold increase. treatment of hepatoma cells with TNF- or LPS induced expression of USP18 in 74.1% 8.9% and 70.5% 5.2% respectively. the degree of protein expression did not correlate completely with mRNA expression, a finding consistent with many genes in the liver. a 6-h exposure to IFN- strongly induced Mx1 expression. a 24-h exposure to TNF- and LPS did not. both TNF- and LPS pretreatment inhibited the effect of 6 h of exposure to IFN- signaling in Huh7.5 hepatoma cells. USP18 siRNA or control siRNA were treated with LPS (100 ng/ml), TNF- (20 ng/ml), and/or IFN- (100 IU/ml) for 24 h or pretreated with LPS (100 ng/ml) or TNF- (20 ng/ml) for 2 h. expression of pSTAT1, STAT1, and ISG15 conjugates was detected by Western blotting. mx1 ISG mRNA expression was measured by qPCR. knockdown of USP18 reversed this effect and augmented the effect of IFN-. the data from this experiment are consistent with those obtained with human hepatocytes. primary murine hepatocytes from USP18+/+ mice were isolated, transfected with anti-USP18 siRNA or control irrelevant siRNA, and pretreated with IFN- (100 IU/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF- (20 ng/ml) after being washed, the cells were cultured in the presence or absence of IFN- for 6 h. hepatocytes transfected with UBE1L siRNA or control siRNA were stimulated with TNF- (20 ng/ml) and LPS (100 ng/ml) for 24 h and then restimulated with IFN- (100 IU/ml) for 6 h. neither the presence nor the relative absence of ISG15 conjugation impacted the ability of TNF- and LPS to block IFN- signaling. usP18+/+ murine hepatocytes were transfected with anti-UBE1L siRNA or control irrelevant siRNA were stimulated with IFN- (100 IU/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF- (20 ng/ml) for 24 h. expression of free ISG, ISG15 conjugates, UBE1L, and actin proteins were measured by Western blotting. STAT1 phosphorylation shows distinct activation profiles with IFN- stimulation compared to TNF- or LPS stimulation. primary murine hepatocytes were treated with IFN- (100U/ml), LPS (100 ng/ml), or TNF- (20 ng/ml) for 6, 12,18, or 24 h. hepatic ischemia/reperfusion induces USP18 expression. HIRI alone induced USP18 mRNA expression in whole livers by >10-fold that of untreated animals. in vivo liver inflammation leads to increased USP18 expression at the organ level. induction of USP18 impairs LPS and TNF- stimulated USP18 induction. hepatocytes were preincubated for 30 min with various inhibitors of LPS and TNF- signaling. only two inhibitors potently (>80%) inhibited USP18 expression. inhibition of NF-B activation impairs LPS- and TNF-stimulated USP18 induction. hepatocytes were stimulated with 100 U of IFN-/ml for 6 h. inflammatory stimuli, including IL-10 and IL-6, are able to induce the expression of USP18. in vivo, hepatic inflammatory stress led to increased hepatic USP18 gene expression that was associated with poor control of LCMV infection. hepatic inflammatory milieu modulates USP18 expression. this mechanism directly impacts the hepatocellular innate immune response. recent work has demonstrated that USP18 has the ability to deubiquitinate the transforming growth factor-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complexes required for NF-B activation in T cells. overexpression of USP18 leads to decreased nuclear activation and impaired formation of TAK1 complexes. inflammation leads to increased hepatocyte USP18, which makes the liver more susceptible to infections targeting the hepatocyte. this mechanism may explain the clinical observation that HCV infection of a transplanted, HCV-naive liver graft is more aggressive than the original infection. however, we have also found that USP18 is necessary but not sufficient on its own to induce an IFN- refractory state (53) hepatic USP18 expression is modulated by inflammatory stimuli. HIRI-induced upregulation of USP18 could lead to worsened outcomes posttransplant, including a quicker, more aggressive reinfection of the new organ."}
