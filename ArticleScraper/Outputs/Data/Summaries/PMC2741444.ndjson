{"summary": "VV is an enveloped, DNA virus with a genome of 192 kb encoding about 200 proteins. it causes major changes in host cell machinery shortly after infection. cytopathic effects are observed several hours after infection with VV. HeLa cells, MDCK cells, HuH7 cells and Con1 cells with full-length HCV genome were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/ml streptomycin. Vaccinia virus WR strain was used to infect HeLa cells in this study following previously published procedures for virus amplification and plaque assay. DNA fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (EcoRI/XbaI) and cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5-His A (linearized by EcoRI/XbaI) this expression plasmid was verified by sequencing. an exgen 500 kit was used to transfect DNA into HeLa cells following manufacturer's instructions. RNAi reagents were obtained from the national RNAi Core Facility. cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin and 400 g/ml G418. Vaccinia virus WR strain was used to infect HeLa cells. gene fragment was digested by restriction enzymes (EcoRI/XbaI) and cloned into expression vector pcDNA3.1-V5-His A (linearized by EcoRI/XbaI) ddRT-PCR Total RNAs were extracted from HeLa cells 21 hr after VV infection (MOI = 1). RNAi experiments were performed using the lentiviral expressing system http://rnai.genmed.sinica.edu.tw. ddRT-PCR assay was performed to examine expression levels of mRNAs from mock-infected and infected HeLa cells. ND4 expression (marked by an arrow) was analyzed by Western blotting. ERK2 protein was served as a loading control. ND4 up-regulated in HuH7 cells after vaccinia virus infection. the ND4 protein is indicated with an arrow while non-specific bands are indicated by thin lines. ERK2 protein was used as a loading control. analysis of several nuclear genes encoding mitochondrial electron transport chain proteins. oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP generation, reduced the production of vaccinia virus. intracellular ATP concentration was significantly increased after VV infection. oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP generation, reduced the production of vaccinia virus. 4.5 M oligomycin was used to evaluate the effect of increased ATP generation on viral protein expression and virus production. the number of intracellular mature virions was reduced to 28% (P = 0.01162) and extracellular enveloped virions to about 66% of control (P = 0.022722) 13 hrs after virus infection. both the intracellular and extracellular vaccinia viruses were reduced 13 hr after virus infection in the presence of 4.5 M oligomycin. western blotting analysis was used to examine whether Bcl-2 expression is involved in the elevated ATP production after VV infection. different shRNA clones against Bcl-2 were used to knock-down its expression in HeLa cells. western blotting analysis of ND4 protein in vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells stably transfected with different shRNA clones against Luc or Bcl-2. ERK2 protein was used as a loading control. four DNA fragments differentially expressed after virus infection were cloned. two fragments were VV genes while the other two were mitochondrial genes ND4 and COII. ND4 protein expression in HeLa cells increased 10 hr after vaccinia virus infection. apigenin (45 uM) significantly reduced the amount of ND4 expression up-regulation induced by VV infection. ara C (40 g/ml) blocked the increase in ND4 expression induced by VV infection. expression of -actin gene or ERK2 gene, no significant differences were observed after VV infection. roman numbers represent the respiratory complex in which the gene participates. intracellular ATP generation increased after vaccinia virus infection. intracellular ATP concentration was significantly increased after VV infection. oligomycin, an inhibitor of ATP generation, reduced the production of vaccinia virus. treatment with 4.5 M oligomycin at 4.5 M reduced the ATP level in virus-infected cells to that of mock-infected cells 13 hr after infection. oligomycin has been used to block ATP production at a concentration greater than 20 M. the intracellular ATP concentration of cells treated with 25 to 35 M oligomycin was reduced to about 50% that of non-treated cells. the intracellular ATP concentration of vaccinia virus infected was measured 13 hrs after virus infection in the presence of 4.5 M oligomycin. expression is involved in the elevated ATP production after VV infection. there was no up-regulation of Bcl-2 in a comparison of mock-infected and virus-infected cells. different shRNA clones against Bcl-2 were used to knock-down its expression in HeLa cells. expression of Bcl-2 was not elevated during vaccinia virus infection. analysis of ND4 protein in vaccinia virus-infected HeLa cells with shRNAs against Luc or Bcl-2. ERK2 protein was used as a loading control. experiments were performed three times in duplicate. up-regulation of mitochondrial-encoded proteins involved in mitochondrial electron transport chain could increase ATP generation. this may suggest that mitochondrial-encoded proteins are rate-determining proteins in ATP generation. this may suggest that increased ATP production is essential for efficient VV production. induction of ND4 protein and increased ATP generation are still occurred after VV infection in HeLa cells with reduced amount of Bcl-2 protein. neither host ND4 nor COII genes were up-regulated by N1L protein. further studies are needed to clarify mechanism(s) of up-regulation of genes involved in ATP production after VV infection. DNA samples in different lanes represent the outcomes of different sets of primers for ddRT-PCR products. samples were prepared from VV-infected HeLa cells, influenza A virus-infected MDCK cells, HCV replicon cells (with sub-genomic HCV RNA), con1 cells (with full-length HCV RNA) and 1.3 ES2 cells (with HBV genome) western blotting was performed 24 hr after oligomycin treatment. ERK2 protein was served as a loading control. lysates from HeLa cells 28 hr after vaccinia virus infection was used as a positive control. ERK2 protein was used as a loading control. RNAi reagents were obtained from the national RNAi Core Facility."}
