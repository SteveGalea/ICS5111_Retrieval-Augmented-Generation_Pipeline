{"summary": "the AP complexes bind both clathrin and various sorting signals. some studies suggest that PSAC sequences bind directly to the medium-sized subunit of the AP complexes (8, 9), a compelling notion. peripheral membrane protein formed a cooperative ternary complex with the cytoplasmic domain (CD) of the class I MHC chain and the subunit of AP-1 (1), a clathrin adaptor involved in transport within the endosomal system (10\u201312). the interaction of acidic residues both in Nef and in the MHC-I CD with basic regions on 1 was critical to the formation of this complex. the acidic cluster on Nef contains no serines. a 1 protein in which this basic region is mutated failed to affect the trafficking of furin, a result attributed to the presence of additional, potentially redundant sorting signals in the CD of the protein (20). if so, whether the furin CD bound 2 was not tested. the physiologic relevance of this specificity is not yet clear. but it might provide the opportunity to inhibit the interaction of viral proteins such as Nef and Vpu with the subunits without inhibiting the interaction of at least some cellular proteins. HIV-1 Vpu is a type I transmembrane protein whose PSAC sequence is EDSGNESE (17) potential additional AP-binding motifs are also present in Vpu and furin (17, 25\u201327) peptides and serine-threonine (ST) phosphorylation are indicated. phosphorylation of the CDs of Vpu and furin and L10 of Serinc3 detected by Phos-tag staining. serines 380 and 383 are part of the putative PSAC. we analyzed phospho-GST-Serinc3 loop 10 by LC/MS. each was phosphorylated by CK-II. Fig. 2 shows a reversed pulldown design in which the C-terminal two-thirds of 2 is used as the bait. serines 356, 359, 367, and 371 are dispensable. the interaction between Serinc3-L10 and 2 requires the acidic residues DEED within the putative PSAC. binding of GST-Serinc3-L10 or related mutants to MBP-1 was quantified by band densitometry in triplicate experiments. values are expressed relative to WT phospho-Serinc3-2, which was set at 100%. we used size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) to analyze equimolar mixtures of the GST fusion proteins containing the CDs of Vpu or furin or Serinc3 loop 10 and MBP-2. each of these CDs forms stable complexes with 2, indicated in each case by the peak in the elution profile designated P1. we immobilized polyhistidine-tagged MBP-2 on a Ni-NTA chip surface. we used the GST-CD fusion proteins at different concentrations as the analytes. derived on/off rates and the KD values for each interaction are shown in Table 1. 0.39) 104 (4.0 0.09) 103 Furin-2c 0.46 0.12 (1.44 0.25) 104 (6.1 0.10) 103 Serinc3-2d 0.2 0.041 (3.4 1.08) 104 (0.79 0.4) 103 Serinc3-S380N/383N mutant-2e 100 77 (2.3 1.5) 10 (1.15 0.22) 103 a Values are the mean S.E. b Values are from the binding runs shown in Fig basic region 1 of 2 contains a lysine analogous to arginine 225 of 1. basic region 2 of 2 consists of only two lysine residues. residues analogous to Lys-274 and Arg-303 of 1 are not present. white asterisks, positions of residues constituting basic regions 1\u20132 of 1. Secondary structures are indicated by arrows (-stands) and coils (-helices) above the sequence. red boxes indicate strict identity. binding of loop 10 of Serinc3 required basic region 4. none of the five basic regions on 2 were critical for interacting with the furin. we tested the possibility that residual binding was due to the YXX sequence upstream of the furin PSAC. of the 36 nonsynonymous substitutions we detected at these sites, 32 involved substitutions to or from a serine. positions 380 and 383 tend to co-evolve (probability = 0.999 in the Bayesian graphical model), favoring a model in which the amino acid at site 383 is conditionally dependent on the amino acid at site 380. the serinc3 PSAC is dispensable for antiviral activity and for counteraction by HIV-1 Nef. the protein reduces the amount of Serinc proteins in virions in a clathrin\u2013 and AP-2\u2013dependent manner, thereby counteracting the negative effect of the Serincs on infectivity. p24 capsid antigen is a cellular protein used as a loading control. p24 is the virion-capsid antigen; p24 is the virion-capsid antigen. p24 is the virion-capsid antigen; p24 is the virion-capsid antigen. more than 25% of surface protein internalized after 10 min. clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a major regulator of surface expression. serinc3 contains a potential PSAC-sorting signal. the transmembrane proteins HIV-1 Vpu, furin, and Serinc3 bind directly to the subunits of AP-1 and AP-2. the transmembrane proteins are numbered N-terminally to C-terminally as L1\u2013L12. GST or GST-Vpu proteins expressed in E. coli either with or without CK-II were tested for binding to 1 and 2. proteins co-expressed with CK-II are denoted by p for presumed phosphorylation. fusions of the C-terminal two-thirds of 1 or 2 to maltose-binding protein (MBP; a solubility-enhancing tag) were used in pulldown assays. the CD of furin and loop 10 of Serinc3 each bound to 1 and 2 in a CK-II\u2013dependent manner. Fig. 2F shows that the interaction between Serinc3 loop 10 and 2 requires the acidic residues DEED within the putative PSAC. this might be due to the loss of net negative charge and/or the loss of a sequence recognized by CK-II. binding of GST-Serinc3-L10 or related mutants to 2 was quantified by band densitometry in triplicate experiments. values are expressed relative to WT phospho-Serinc3-2, which was set at 100%. GST-Serinc3-L10 and GST-Serinc3-L10 were fractionated by SEC either alone (P2; blue) or after mixing in equimolar amounts with MBP-2 (P3; green). top, protein absorbance values versus elution volume for the three independent SEC experiments. the KD of the furin CD\u20132 interaction was 0.46 0.12 m, substantially less than the published KD of the interaction of a phosphorylated furin peptide with 1. this could reflect differences between 1 and 2; the use of a relatively short peptide in the studies of 1 rather than the entire CD as used here. d Values are from the binding runs shown in Fig. 3 plus a second set of runs using the same protein preparations. basic regions 1 and 2 are each required for the binding of the Vpu CD to either 1 or 2. we extended this analysis to the interactions of 2 with the furin CD and loop 10 of Serinc3. the pulldown data indicate that neither basic region 1 nor 2 of 2 is required for binding. basic region 4 (BR-4) is required for binding Serinc3-L10. phosphorylation-independent binding of the furin CD to 2 contributes minimally to the binding of the phosphorylated furin CD. three additional basic regions on the surface of 2, designated 3, 4 and 5 are dispensable. a phylogeny of eutheria based on serinc3 mRNA sequence is shown in Fig. 5. position 383 of Serinc3 has alternated between serine, asparagine, and glycine during eutherian evolution. of the 36 nonsynonymous substitutions we detected, 32 involved substitutions to or from a serine. cladogram of placental mammals depicting the coordinated evolution at codon position 380 and 383 of the Serinc3 loop 10. blue branches indicate amino acid substitutions at site 380, red branches indicate amino acid substitutions at site 383, and purple branches indicate amino acid substitutions at both sites. Western blotting indicated that all of the Serinc3 proteins were detected in partially purified preparations of virions. each of the Serinc3 proteins was excluded from virions by Nef. the serinc3 PSAC is dispensable for antiviral activity. serinc3 protein intensity was normalized to loading controls. data are expressed relative to the WT HIV-1, WT Serinc3 control. this observation could be consistent with a reduced rate of Serinc3 endocytosis in the absence of the PSAC. basic regions on 1 and the analogous basic regions on 2 (the subunit of AP-2) are required for interaction with the cytoplasmic domain of the HIV-1 immunomodulatory protein Vpu (17). we found that the CD of furin binds to 1 and 2 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. furin and Vpu encode potential YXX and EXXXL signals at different distances from their PSACs. the binding site for YXX signals in the same CD is plausibly exemplified by the HIV-1 Nef\u2013MHC-I chain CD\u20131 complex. basic region 1 of 2 appeared to contribute modestly to binding of the furin CD to 2. but its role in binding loop 10 of Serinc3 was much more striking. at least two binding sites for AP2 on AP-2 have been described. the AP2 core is shown in an \u201copen\u201d conformation (PDB code 2XA7). a peptide derived from TGN38 and bound to the YXX-binding pocket of 2 is shown by green spheres. the TMs of Serinc3 and furin are shown schematically. the ability of Serinc3 to bind 2 via the PSAC in loop 10 appears to wax and wane over the phylogeny of placental mammals. this function is provided by the transmembrane protein glycoGag in murine leukemia virus and by the S2 protein in equine infectious anemia virus (34, 35) endogenous Serinc3 is endosomal and its endosomal distribution is modulated by AP-4, an AP family member with relatively poorly characterized function. a haploid cell genetic screen using a gene-disrupting retrovirus and a fusion protein of CD8 and the CD of furin revealed that 1 is a target of the PSAC in furin (20) the interaction of the furin CD with 2 is a key determinant of furin trafficking. this scenario offers the potential to inhibit the interaction of viral proteins such as Nef and Vpu with specific basic regions on the subunits. expression plasmids encoding pBJ5-SERINC3 were transferred to a pBJ5 expression vector by restriction digestion and ligation using NotI and EcoRI sites. the plasmids were generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit. s 158\u2013423) and 2 (residues 159\u2013435) in the pMAT9s vector. the GST tag was added to the C terminus of a previously created MBP-2CTD construct with a tobacco etch virus protease cut site between 2CTD and GST in the pMAT9s vector. lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 37 \u00b0C. the urea concentration was adjusted to 2 m by the addition of 7.75 l of water. samples were then enzymatically digested with 2.0 g of trypsin. peptides were eluted with 0.1% TFA, 80% acetonitrile. MS was acquired in profile mode over the 300\u20131,700 m/z range. data-dependent spectra were acquired in centroid mode on top 20 precursors per MS scan. phosphorylation of Vpu, furin, and Serinc3 was checked using the vendor-provided protocol. equal amounts of proteins expressed either with or without CK-II were run on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel. the gel was imaged using a 300-nm UV transilluminator. the resin was extensively washed with 4 750 l of GST binding buffer. the eluting protein was detected by UV absorbance at 280 nm. the CDs of Vpu, furin, and Serinc3 each fused to GST were assessed as free analytes in solution (PBS at pH 7.4) for measurement of the kinetic parameters, the analytes were serially diluted to five different concentrations. the data were analyzed using a global fit 1:1 model, yielding the association (kon), dissociation (koff), and affinity constants (kd) for each interaction. infectivity was determined by infecting 2 104 HeLa cells in a 48-well plate. the cells were fixed and stained for -gal activity, and the number of infectious centers was measured by computer-assisted image analysis. the data are expressed as the number normalized to the concentration of HIV capsid antigen (p24) cells were maintained in modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum, penicillin/streptomycin, and 1 g/ml puromycin. the proviral plasmids pNL4-3 and pNL4-3Nef have been described previously (39\u201341) loop 10 of Serinc3 (residues 354\u2013404) is predicted to be cytoplasmic. by sequence inspection it contains a potential PSAC motif. we cloned this loop into the pGEX4T1 vector. MBP-1, MBP-2, and MBP-2-GST proteins were co-expressed with the pGro7 chaperone vector. cells were resuspended in appropriate binding buffers and lysed either by a french press homogenizer or by micofluidization. in-solution protein digestion Samples (95 g in 5.0 l of Tris buffer including 2 mm DTT) were denatured by the addition of 5.0 l of 8 m urea, 0.4 m ammonium bicarbonate. the proteins were reduced by the addition of 1.0 l of 45 mm DTT (Pierce Thermo Scientific) and incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min.
