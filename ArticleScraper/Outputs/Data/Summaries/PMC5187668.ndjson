{"summary": "mice in which Zeb2 is conditionally deleted in cells expressing Cre recombinase driven by the Itgax promoter (CD11c-Cre) showed substantially decreased pDC frequency in the spleen and skin-draining LN but not in the BM. pDCs were ablated in vivo 7\u20139 d after two treatments with poly(I:C), and this ablation persisted for at least 1 y. shown are representative two-color histograms comparing spleen populations (Top) and a plot displaying frequency of pDCs as a proportion of all singlet lymphocytes (Bottom) numbers at the top indicate percentage of cells within the indicated gate; dots at the bottom each represent a distinct biological replicate. short-term inducible deletion and CD11c-Cre\u2013driven conditional deletion of Zeb2 do not change spleen or BM cellularity. samples prepared from the spleen and BM and harvested from mice of the indicated genotypes are compared for cell count. 4-OHT treatment eliminated pDC development in Flt3L-treated cultures of Zeb2fl/fl;R26iCre/iCre BM. we analyzed the development of CD19Ly-6GKithiFlt3+ progenitors in the presence of Flt3L and 4-OHT, mixing CD45.2+ Zeb2fl/fl/fl;R26iCre/iCre cells with congenically marked CD45.1+ s of whole BM isolated from WT or Zeb2+/ mice were mixed with congenically marked (CD45.1+ CD45.2) single-cell suspensions of whole BM isolated from mice of the indicated genotypes were cultured in the presence of Flt3L. shown is proportion of cells expressing CD45.2 (blue) or not expressing CD45.2 (orange) among progeny within the indicated subsets. Zeb2-sufficient and Zeb2fl/fl/fl;Mx1-Cre(tg) progenitors diverted progenitors toward CD24+ cDC development. this action of Zeb2 was cell-intrinsic because Zeb2-sufficient cells contributed exclusively to pDC development. BM Kithi Flt3+ progenitors isolated from mice of the indicated genotypes were cultured in the presence of Flt3L (FL) and IFN we examined targets of Zeb2 regulated during DC development by gene expression microarray analysis of WT and CD11c-Cre\u2013driven Zeb2-deficient splenic Sirp-+ cDCs. expression of Lyz2 (encoding lysozyme) decreased more than twofold and that of Csf1r was halved in Zeb2-deficient Sirp-+ cDCs compared with WT. deficient sirp-+ cDCs express more abundant Id2 mRNA. compared to changes in gene expression between WT CD24+ cDCs and WT Sirp-+ cDCs. both axes are logarithmic, and probe sets with less than 1.9-fold changes in expression are omitted for clarity. Ifi204 encodes a protein known to antagonize the function of Id2 by cytoplasmic translocation. expression of Ifi204 induced no significant change in the frequency of pDCs or cDCs. two-color histograms comparing pDC and cDC frequency among transduced cells 6 d after transduction. shown are two-color histograms comparing pDC and cDC frequency among transduced (GFP+) cells 6 d after transduction. monocytes were restored to pretreatment frequencies within 3 d in mice. Zeb2 was expressed in all LinM-CSFR+ cells in the BM. Zeb2 is required for monocyte development in the spleen and BM. shown are representative two-color histograms. BM and spleen from poly(I:C)-treated mice of the indicated genotypes are compared for monocyte (mo.) frequency 7\u20139 d after treatment. shown are two-color histograms for representative samples (Left) and plots displaying frequency of the indicated subsets as a proportion of all singlet lymphocytes (Right) Ltf (encoding lactotransferrin), Mmp9 (encoding matrix metallopeptidase 9), and Camp (encoding cathelicidin antimicrobial peptide) were more abundantly expressed in Zeb2-deficient Ly-6Chi monocytes and in WT neutrophils. Zeb2-deficient Ly-6Chi monocytes also showed increased expression of several genes characteristic of the GMP (43) and not highly expressed in neutrophils. sets are more abundantly expressed in Zeb2-deficient monocytes but not in Zeb2-sufficient neutrophils (solid green), or more abundantly expressed both in Zeb2-deficient monocytes and in Zeb2-sufficient neutrophils (solid red) numbers in each outlined region indicate absolute probe set count. deletion of Zeb2 resulted in loss of M-CSFR expression in the BM and in the long-term ablation of Ly-6Chi monocytes. we describe an action of Zeb2 in promoting M-CSFR expression and repressing expression of neutrophil genes in favor of monocyte development. derepression of Id2 due to Zeb2 deficiency alters balance between Id2 and E2-2, increasing cDC1 output and decreasing pDC output. previously, the similarly incomplete abrogation of pDC and cDC2 development resulting from CD11c-Cre\u2013driven Zeb2 deletion suggested a role for this transcription factor in commitment to both lineages (18). genitors with type I IFN diverted nearly all progenitors to the cDC1 fate. this observation is not explained by selective death of pDCs and cDC2s. pDC development requires cell-intrinsic Zeb2 expression and is not compensated by type I IFN signaling. data were analyzed using FlowJo software (FlowJo) all gating strategies incorporated size and doublet discrimination based on forward and side scatter parameters. antibodies purchased from BD Biosciences, BioLegend, eBioscience, or Tonbo Biosciences were used to detect surface markers by flow cytometry. anti-CD3 (17A2) conjugated to eFluor (eF) 450; anti-CD3e (145-2C11) conjugated to biotin or PE; anti-CD4 (RM4-5) conjugated to PE-Cy7 or PerCP-Cy5.5; anti-CD8a (53-6 anti-CD45.2 (104) conjugated to APC, APC-eF780, PE, or PerCP-Cy5.5. anti-CD64 (X54-5/7.1) conjugated to AF647; anti-Thy1.1 (OX-7) conjugated to PE; anti-CD103 (2E7) conjugated to PE; anti-CD105 (2E7) conjugated to PE; anti-Kit (ACK2) conjugated to APC-eF780, biotin, Brilliant anti-fcRI (MAR-1) conjugated to PE; anti-IgM (11\u201326) conjugated to PE; anti-IgM (11\u201326) conjugated to PE; anti-IgM (11\u201326) conjugated to PE; anti-Ki-67 (B56) conjugated to PE; anti\u2013Sca-1 (D7) conjugated to biotin, PerCP-Cy5.5, or PE-Cy7; anti\u2013Ly-6C (AL-21) gene deletion in cultures of Zeb2fl/fl;Mx1-Cre(tg) cells was induced by i.p. injection of 100\u2013150 g poly(I:C) (Sigma-Aldrich; 1.0 mg/mL stock solution dissolved in saline) either once (Fig. 5A) or twice within 36\u201372 h (all other experiments) single-cell suspensions of whole BM were diluted to a concentration of 2 106 cells/mL and cultured in the presence of Flt3L for 9\u201310 d. a sequence encoding FLAG-tagged Smad7 was amplified from the pBabe Flag Smad7 plasmid.
