{"summary": "METHODS Literature Review We conducted a literature review to identify studies with pneumonia etiology data in children under five years old. titles and abstracts were screened to identify potential studies with pneumonia etiology data. iology results or methodology details, longest surveillance period, or the oldest reference, as the \u201cmain publication\u201d if publications referred to a particular surveillance network that included sites in multiple countries, we included a result for the entire surveillance network and individual results for each country if they were published separately. literature review We conducted a literature review to identify studies with pneumonia etiology data. all searches were conducted using the PubMed database and entering search terms that were key words, MeSH terms, synonyms or truncations. the publication with the most comprehensive etiology results or methodology details, longest surveillance period, or the oldest reference, was designated the \u201cmain publication\u201d when publications referred to a particular surveillance network that included sites in multiple countries, we included a result for the entire surveillance network and individual results for each country if they were published separately. RESULTS Literature Review Of 2511 titles and abstracts reviewed, 2311 were excluded because they did not meet eligibility criteria. the full text of 200 publications was reviewed, and 88 studies with child pneumonia etiology results were included. studies ranged in size from 12 to 27 778 pneumonia patients (median 780 patients) there were 16 countries that reported multiple studies. among the 65 pneumonia etiology studies, 41 countries were represented. study was not a pneumonia etiology study, the study did not include children less than five years of age or multiple responses were received describing the same study. among the 65 pneumonia etiology studies, 41 countries were represented. there were few studies identified in Latin America (outside of Brazil, Chile and Argentina), in west and particularly central Africa, and in the Middle East. this gap may be due in part to our English language inclusion criterion. it is important to have data from places where child pneumonia mortality is the highest. studies in community-based settings, health centers or outpatient wards may find different ranges of etiologies than referral hospitals. a simple clinical case definition based on tachypnea (eg, nonsevere pneumonia defined by the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness) may also identify relatively more viral infections. the use of PCR as a diagnostic tool was higher in the studies reported on the survey (68%) than in those already published in the literature (46%). the findings of PCR testing of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs will need to be interpreted judiciously. as PCR use increases, strategies must be used to help interpret these findings. PERCH will create a reference standard for the design, conduct and analysis of pneumonia etiology studies. this will provide evidence for the utility of certain body fluid specimens and laboratory tests. PERCH will also contribute to a refinement of the case definition of pneumonia. this work was supported by grant 48968 from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. this article was published as part of a supplement sponsored by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to the PERCH Project of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, Baltimore, Maryland."}
