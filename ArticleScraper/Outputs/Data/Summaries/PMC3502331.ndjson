{"summary": "previous studies suggest that BHV-1 may induce apoptosis in MDBK cells via a mechanism only involving caspases and p53. however, the mechanism for BHV-1-induced MDBK cell apoptosis still requires more research. bovine herpes virus type 1 (BHV-1) causes severe respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, abortion, vulvovaginitis, balanopostitis, and systemic infection in neonate calves. BHV-1 causes severe respiratory infection, conjunctivitis, abortion, vulvovaginitis, and systemic infection in neonate calves. BHV-1 infection induced apoptosis in MDBK cells. BHV-1 infection appears to activate caspase-8 by Fas-dependent mechanism. BHV-1 infection also activates caspase-9 by mitochondria-initiated pathway. the reduction in cell viability at 2 MOI appeared about 24 h p.i. compared with mock-infected cells. cell viability changes of BHV-1-infected MDBK cells increased in a time-dependent and MOI-dependent manner. mock-infected and BHV-1-infected MDBK cells were examined for characteristic signs of apoptosis using fluorescent microscope, agarose gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry. BHV-1-infected cells showed typical apoptotic features with chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation. pase-3 were cleaved by caspase-3. their activated form showed a time- and dose-dependent increase upon BHV-1 infection. no cleaved PARP was detected in mock-infected cells. the activity of caspase-3 was measured by colorimetric assay kit. the relative caspase-3 activity was calculated after the activity of caspase-3 in cells treated with BHV-1 or inhibitors subtracted the background value. BHV-1 infection induces apoptosis by binding its receptor, Fas Ligand (FasL) [11] caspase-8 was activated within the BHV-1-infected MDBK cells. BHV-1 infection provokes apoptosis via Fas/FasL pathway. it is known that activated caspase-8 is able to cleave full-length Bid to tBid. this is important in crosstalk between the death-receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway in some cell types. tBid was detected in BHV-1-infected cells but not in mock-infected cells. pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax or Bak activated upon apoptosis signals results in outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL can prevent this occurrence [13] Bcl-2 and Bax protein expression in cells mock-infected or BHV-1-infected (2 MOI) for indicated hours or different MOI for 48 h. data are mean SD from three independent experiments. interaction between virus replication and cell apoptosis. caspase-3 inhibitor could increase virus replication dramatically. caspase-8 caspase-9 inhibitor did not show dramatic effects. NH4Cl treatment decreased viral titer and attenuated BHV-1-induced apoptosis. BHV-1 was inactivated by exposing to a 30 W UV germicidal light at a distance of 30 cm for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. BHV-1 infection induced apoptosis in cells infected with UV-inactivated BHV-1. infection with amounts as low as 0.0032 MOI of BHV-1 had almost no impact on cell viability. reduction in cell viability at 2 MOI appeared about 24 h p.i. compared with mock-infected cells. BHV-1-infected cells showed typical apoptotic features with chromatin condensation and nuclear fragmentation to different extent after AO/EB staining. the percentage of apoptotic cells were detected in BHV-1-infected MDBK cells at 24 h p.i. full-length procaspase-8, procaspase-9 and procaspase-3 were cleaved. their activated form showed a time- and dose-dependent increase upon BHV-1 infection. no cleaved PARP was detected in mock-infected cells. values are mean SD, * p 0.05, ** p 0.01 versus BHV-1 infection alone without inhibitors. cells were incubated with 20 M of each caspase inhibitors for 2 h prior to infection with BHV-1 at 2 MOI for 48 h. ic and intrinsic pathways are involved in caspase-3 activation and BHV-1-induced apoptosis. the extrinsic apoptosis pathway depends on regulating expression of Fas. caspase-8 was activated within the BHV-1-infected MDBK cells. caspase-9 activity was measured by a colorimetric assay kit. it is known that activated caspase-8 is able to cleave full-length Bid to tBid. this is important in crosstalk between the death-receptor pathway and the mitochondrial pathway in some cell types. BHV-1 infection regulates the expression of the Bcl-2 family of proteins. pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax or Bak activated upon apoptosis signals results in outer mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bcl-2 or Bcl-XL can prevent this occurrence. apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) was up-regulated in dose- and time-dependent manner. results suggest that Bax and Bcl-2 might play roles in regulating mitochondria. the pan caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) increases virus yield approximately 2 fold in MDBK cells. the pan caspase inhibitor (Z-VAD-FMK) increases virus yield approximately 2 fold in MDBK cells. iters are shown as lg TCID50/ml. cells infected with NH4Cl were infected with 2 MOI BHV-1 for 48 h. DNA fragmentation in the presence of NH4Cl infected cells was examined. anatid herpesvirus type 1 (AHV-1) infection induces apoptosis in duck embryo fibroblast cells. the attachment of BHV-1 virions to cells induces apoptotic cell death in PBMC cells and bovine BL-3 (B lymphoma cells) BHV-1 induces apoptosis in BHV-1-infected MDBK cells, involving caspase-8-dependent pathways. this suggests an extrinsic pathway was involved in the BHV-1-induced apoptosis. however, just how Fas expression is regulated by BHV-1 remains unclear. apoptosis is strictly controlled by Bcl-2 family members. some viruses encode proteins homologous to Bcl-2 to inhibit apoptosis. apoptosis is a result of crosstalk between extrinsic and intrinsic pathways. blocking caspase-8 activity does not completely abrogate caspase-9 activation. this suggests that caspase-9 is activated not only by caspase-8 activation but also by other upstream apoptotic signals. BHV-1 needs to penetrate MDBK cells to trigger cell death. BHV-1 induces cell death in a cell-type-dependent fashion. this is probably because novel virus-host interactions are important for BHV-1-initiated apoptosis in different cell types. BHV-1 infection activities caspase-8 through a death receptor pathway by regulating Fas/FasL expression. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated secondary antibody was purchased from Pierce (Pierce, Rockford, IL, US). the BHV-1 Shaanxi strain was isolated and characterized in 2009. h p.i. cells were stained with acridine orange (AO, 200 g /ml) and ethidium bromide (EB, 200 g /ml) and then washed with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) after that, slides were covered with cover slips and observed under a fluorescence microscope (Nikon Inc, Japan) Flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis was performed by analyzing the reduced fluorescence of the DNA binding dye propidium iodide (PI) in the apoptotic nuclei. cells were seeded in 6-well plastic tissue culture plates and mock infected with BHV-1. cells were fixed and permeabilized by suspension in 70% cold ethanol and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. Western blot analysis Cells were harvested and treated with ice-cold RIPA (Radio Immunoprecipitation Assay) lysis buffer with 1 mM phenylmethyl sulfonylfluoride (PMSF) Isolation of mitochondrial and cytosolic proteins was performed using the Mitochondria/cytosol Fractionation Kit. the relative quantification of gene expression was analyzed by the two-ddCt method [38]. the relative quantification of gene expression was analyzed by the two-ddCt method. the BHV-1 Shaanxi strain was isolated and characterized in 2009. cells were infected with BHV-1 at different MOI (50, 10, 2, 0.4, 0.008, 0.016, and 0.0032 MOI) the normal cells and early apoptotic cells can be stained by AO to appear bright green fluorescence. late apoptotic cells can be stained by EB to appear orange fluorescence. DNA fragmentation assay Mock-infected cells or BHV-1-infected cells were harvested, washed and incubated with lysis buffer (20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 0.8% SDS) cell pellet was resuspended at room temperature in hypotonic solution. cell pellet was resuspended at room temperature in hypotonic solution. at least 10,000 events were acquired for each sample. quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol agent (Invitrogen, California, USA) and 2 g each RNA sample was reverse-transcribed using First-strand cDNA synthesis kit (invitrogen, California, USA) the expression of apoptotic regulating genes was quantified using a quantitative real-time PCR assay (qRT-PCR) CCCGAGAGGTCTTTTT TGATGGTCCTGATCAACTCG 151 XM_003585205.1 Bcl-2 ATGTGTGTGTGTGTGTCGTCAA CTAGGGCCATACAGCTCCAC 146 NM_001166486.1 GAPDHF ATGCTGGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGCTCCAC 151 XM_003585205.1 GAPDHF ATGCTGTGTGCTAT 293 XM_001252511."}
