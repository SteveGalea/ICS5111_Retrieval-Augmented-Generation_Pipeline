{"summary": "antiviral immunity may play an important role in the pathogenesis of asthma. TBK1, kinase inactive mutant TBK1 (K38A) and IFN reporter were generous gifts from K. Fitzgerald (University of Massachusetts). primary airway tracheobronchial epithelial cells were established as described elsewhere. monolayered primary cells (mainly basal cells) were used in the study to achieve high viral infection. IFN-1 Forward: GGACGCCTTGGAAGAGTCACT; reverse: AAAGCCATGATGCAATCTCC IL-6 Forward: GTAGTGGAACAAGCCAGAGC; reverse: TCAGGGGTGTGTGTGTGTGCAGTT; reverse: GCTCTGTGTGTGTGCAGTT; reverse: GCTCTGTGTGTGTGCAGTT; reverse: GCTCTGTGTGTGTGTGCAGTT; reverse: TCAGGGGTGTGTGTGTGTGT significance was assessed with the Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-ranks test. titer was determined based on previous published protocol. monoclonal antibody targeting RV16 coat protein was generated as described elsewhere. monolayered primary cells (mainly basal cells) were used in the study to achieve high viral infection. each experiment involving primary cells was repeated on at least three independent donors. cells were transfected with IFN luciferase reporter plus TBK1 or plus TBK1 (K38A) at 24 hours after transfection, the cells were treated with or without Alt for 3 hours and lysed with passive lysis buffer. Alt significantly enhanced productions of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by RV infection. IL-6 concentration was 115, 253, 795 pg/ml in samples of RV infection alone (RV), Alt exposure alone (Alt) and the combined treatment (RV+Alt), respectively. IL-8 was 746, 856, and 2,089 pg/ml, respectively. Alt repressed RV-induced IFN expression and enhanced RV replication in epithelial cells. cells were infected with RV 16 and treated with Alt individually. RNA was collected 24 hours later and was analyzed by real-time PCR. the gene expression was significantly elevated at 3 hours, peaked at 6 hours, and then decreased at 24 hours. dsRNA treatment also induced the expression of type I (Figure 3E) and III IFN (Figure 3F) both IFN\u2019s gene expressions peaked at 3 hours, rapidly decreased at 6 hours, and almost completely fell back to the control level at 24 hours. IL-6 (A, C), IL-8 (B, D), IFN- (E) and IFN-1(F) expression was determined. dsRNA-treated samples at later time points were compared with the control. the cells were treated with dsRNA for 3 hours. dsRNA or Alt individually activated NF-B (increased P\u2013I-kappa B) and MAPKs (increased p-ERK, P38, and JNK) as expected, the combined treatment of dsRNA and Alt further enhanced the activation of these pathways. dsRNA and Alt enhanced ds-activated cellular signaling in epithelial cells. Alt significantly repressed TBK1-IRF3 activation, causing a decreased level of p-IRF3. the antagonistic effect of Alt on dsRNA-induced IFN expression appeared to be mediated. heat-inactivated Alt lost the repressing effect on IFN expression. protease inhibitor treatment had no effect on dsRNA-induced IFN expression. separate fungal components were responsible for the opposite effects of Alt on virus-induced airway epithelial immunity. Alt significantly enhanced productions of IL-6 and IL-8 induced by RV infection. IL-6 concentration was 115, 253, 795 pg/ml in the samples of RV infection alone (RV), Alt exposure alone (Alt) and the combined treatment (RV+Alt), respectively. IL-8 was 746, 856, and 2,089 pg/ml, respectively. repressed RV-induced IFN expression and enhanced RV replication in epithelial cells. cells were infected with RV 16 and treated with Alt individually or in combination. RNA was collected 24 hours later and was analyzed by real-time PCR. dsRNA treatment also induced the expression of type I (Figure 3E) and III IFN (Figure 3F) both IFN\u2019s gene expressions peaked at 3 hours, rapidly decreased at 6 hours, and almost completely fell back to the control level at 24 hours. dsRNA-treated samples were compared with the control. dsRNA-treated samples were compared with dsRNA for 3 hours. dsRNA-treated samples were compared with the control. dsRNA or Alt individually activated NF-B (increased P\u2013I-kappa B) and MAPKs (increased p-ERK, P38, and JNK) as expected, the combined treatment of dsRNA and Alt further enhanced the activation of these pathways. Alt significantly repressed TBK1-IRF3 activation, causing a decreased level of p-IRF3. so, the antagonistic effect of Alt on dsRNA-induced IFN expression appeared to be mediated by its repression of the TBK1-IRF3 pathway. heat-sensitive, protease-dependent fungal components appeared to be responsible for the Alt-induced proinflammatory cytokine production and its synergism with dsRNA. but protease inhibitor treatment had no effect on dsRNA-induced IFN expression. a single adaptor protein, TICAM1 (or TRIF), is responsible for these two responses via separate protein domains (44). TICAM1 (or TRIF) is responsible for these responses via separate protein domains (44). NF-B and AP-1 are key factors driving the transcription of proinflammatory cytokines. an additional adaptor, NAP1, is required to activate TBK1-IKK. we have found that Alt represses virus-induced IFN production by a protease-independent mechanism. a recent report on the repression of IFN by Alt in dendritic cells (52) supports this notion. this area has not been elaborated in the fungal infection/exposure. these filtrates have been successfully used in a mouse model to generate many bona fide asthma-like pathologies (62) the degree to which they coexist in the human airway is unclear. persistent exposure to Alt may permanently alter the epithelial antiviral immunity."}
