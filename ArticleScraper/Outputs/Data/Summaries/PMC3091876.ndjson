{"summary": "the world health organization (WHO) has identified more than 1100 epidemic events worldwide in the last five years alone. this infectious disease threat, combined with a concern over man-made biological or chemical events, spurred WHO to update their IHR in 2005. the new 2005 IHR significantly expanded the scope of reportable conditions and are intended to help prevent and respond to global public health threats. the current SAGES initiative leverages the experience gained in the development of ESSENCE. this paper will describe the key features and potential uses of the SAGES product in developing or resource-limited settings. this paper will describe the key features and potential uses of the SAGES product. ESSENCE collects, processes, and analyzes non-traditional data sources. the data can be queried, analyzed, and visualized both temporally and spatially by the end user. the current SAGES initiative leverages the experience gained in the development of ESSENCE. the SAGES tools are built in a modular nature, which allows the user to select one or more tools to enhance an existing surveillance system. each locality can select tools from SAGES based on their needs, capabilities, and existing systems to create a customized electronic disease surveillance system. the SAGES web-based application and the desktop application are both freely-available tools that provide similar functionality to countries with limited public health resources. all ESSENCE applications contain alerting algorithms developed by JHU/APL and the Early Aberration Reporting System (EARS) algorithms developed by the u.s. centers for disease control and prevention (CDC) users also have the ability to add additional algorithms as desired. all graphs and charts products may be exported into common graphic formats. communications SAGES tools can facilitate compliance with 2005 IHR reporting requirements. dissemination of this type of information may aid in the interpretation of regional events. surveillance is to direct expenditure of limited public health resources. only those diseases with the highest burdens on the population should be followed. SAGES does not include tools for the automated evaluation of surveillance systems. the suite for automated global electronic biosurveillance (SAGES) is a collection of modular, flexible, freely-available software tools for electronic disease surveillance in resource-limited settings. one or more SAGES tools may be used in concert with existing surveillance applications or the SAGES tools may be used en masse for an end\u2013to-end biosurveillance capability. ESSENCE Desktop Edition is a single-user stand-alone analysis and visualization tool that can be installed on most computers. the web-based tool, known as OpenESSENCE, is a multi-user network accessible data entry, analysis, and visualization tool that enables an epidemiologist to monitor the population's health. infoShare allows each user to determine role-based access to public health information. the data are collected and stored only by the user, and remain under the sole control of the user at all times. data acquisition is arguably the most challenging aspect of establishing a successful electronic disease surveillance system. the approach should allow customizable data collection, enable multiple data streams collected in different ways, and be scalable based upon needs. the enterprise ESSENCE system requires a high speed internet connection and relies on automated data streams. openESSENCE is a multi-user network accessible data entry, analysis, and visualization tool that enables an epidemiologist to monitor the population's health from any computer connected to that network. available analyses for both tools depend on the nature of the data ingestion, but may include demographic characterizations, temporal and spatial analyses. infoShare allows each user to determine role-based access to public health information. data are collected and stored only by the user, and remain under the sole control of the user at all times. the phone calls needed for IVR are very expensive in the Philippines while SMS text messages cost very little. an existing paper-based fever surveillance system was modified to allow basic information (age, sex, clinic, and symptoms) on patients presenting with fever to be sent daily via SMS using a standardized texting protocol. the SMS messages are received by a cell phone attached to a computer located at the health department. the correct formatted messages are copied to a database that is then analyzed in EDE. some clinics quickly adapted to the SMS protocol, while others have found it more difficult to send error-free messages. we have combined electronic disease surveillance tools developed at JHU/APL with other freely-available, interoperable software tools to create SAGES. this suite of tools will facilitate local and regional electronic disease surveillance, regional public health collaborations, and international disease reporting. opportunities for collaboration are currently being discussed in central and east africa sites as well."}
