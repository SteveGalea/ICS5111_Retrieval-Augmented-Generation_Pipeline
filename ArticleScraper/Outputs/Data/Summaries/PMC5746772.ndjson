{"summary": "biosensor technologies based on Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), Surface Plasmon Resonance Imaging (SPRi) and Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) have proven the practicality and effectiveness of monitoring molecular interactions. RT-LF biosensor techniques are very powerful and useful for the characterization of molecular interactions during most stages of vaccine production and development. the assay begins with an initial baseline using an assay buffer, followed by a ligand molecule immobilization on the surface of the biosensor (loading), then finalized with dissociation in the presence of buffer only. the binding response is measured and reported in real time in the form of a sensorgram trace. affinity measures how strong the interaction is and is depicted when binding reaches an equilibrium. BLI technology combines high-throughput characteristics of a 96-well or 384-well plate format with improved precision, reproducibility, and ease of use. other biosensor technologies like SPR require extensive instrument maintenance, buffer/sample treatments, and microfluidics maintenance that add time and cost of operations. the global vaccine market is increasingly demanding as populations grow and microbe adaptability increases. a short summary enlisting different diseases is presented on Table A1 (Appendix A) the incredible diversity of microbes and their ability to adapt require constant investigation of the molecular interactions. the following examples show different applications and strategies employing BLI technology in the field of vaccine studies. mutated recombinant L1 proteins were immobilized onto Ni-NTA biosensors. authors compared binding kinetics of WT-L1 (wild type), N27A, Q31A, and D35A against mAbs. no significant effect on binding affinity was observed with other L1 mAbs. the epitope is immobilized to the biosensor first, and the mAb antibodies in solution are allowed to bind to the epitopes. this approach is useful for site-directed mutagenesis research because BLI assists in testing the modified peptides for their affinity and binding characteristics. the selected epitope scaffolds were transiently expressed in cells, purified, and their affinities tested on an BLI Octet instrument. the authors used a BLI instrument to show binding affinity between HCV epitope scaffolds to the neutralizing antibodies. the use of label-free biosensors has contributed to several case studies reported for influenza [11], RSV [12], and HIV [13]. biosensor technologies provide affinity and kinetics binding information that is crucial for characterization studies. the resulting four clones were further characterized using BLI technology. two of the remaining clones showed similar binding profile as a previously characterized KP3 antibody. ELISA may distort molecule conformation, miss information on low affinity antibodies pairs, and limit the ability to troubleshoot the assay due to its limited end-point, label-dependent technology. ELISA is traditionally used for sandwich and premix assays. HTX can reliably measure kinetics of mAb-antigen interactions. authors studied the L1 epitopes to understand the protective mechanism of the anti-L1 antibody. they compared the binding kinetics of WT-L1 (wild type), N27A, Q31A, and D35A against mAbs. no significant effect on binding affinity was observed with other L1 mAbs. site-directed mutagenesis was used to alter L1 residues. BLI was used to test their affinity to anti-L1 mAbs. mAb antibodies in solution are allowed to bind to epitopes. epitope scaffolding makes use of computational design for grafting an epitope of interest onto a heterologous protein scaffold [8,9] this epitope-focused vaccine design strategy can be very successful in improving vaccine potency or finding an effective vaccine target. characterization of Hepatitis C viral epitope scaffolds (magenta) generated from antigenic sites of the HCV envelope glycoproteins E1 and E2. the antibodies are bound to a preexisting IgG on the surface of the biosensor. the epitope scaffolds in solution are allowed to bind to the secondary antibody. the authors screened and characterized epitopes by panning single-chain variable fragment (scFv) antibody phage libraries against the recombinant MrkA protein. they used a biotinylated antigen captured on the BLI streptavidin biosensors. BLI Octet instruments are accepted as a complimentary tool for epitope binning. they enable the parallel analysis of 96 independent analyte/ligand pairs. classical sandwich and in-tandem formats are used for crude monoclonal antibody supernatants. kinetics screening using RT-LF biosensor technologies provide rapid selection of potential candidates. HTX can reliably measure kinetics of mAb-antigen interactions for a wide range of binding affinities. greater advantage of BLI over other RT-LF biosensor technologies include reduced hands-on time, reduced assay time, and higher throughput. bornholdt et al. [24] were able to identify a mAb targeting the GP1/GP2 interface and GP stalk region. this showed great progress in the identification of mAbs for the next generation of EBOV immunotherapeutics. the approach used in this case takes advantage of a preexisting antihuman IgG bound to the AHQ biosensor. asokan et al. characterized bispecific antibodies targeting different epitopes of the HIV1 envelope protein. increased broad and potent neutralization was observed with a bispecific antibody containing arms that bind to the different regions of HIV virus. the bispecific antibody was bound to the second antigen. this way it has augmented neutralizing abilities because it recognizes two different sites of the HIV virus. the ability to test a multitude of targets is crucial for vaccine development. the approach used in this case takes advantage of a preexisting antihuman IgG bound to the AHQ biosensor to immobilize the human IgGs in large quantities. this approach shows the versatility of BLI in delivering fast and high-throughput results. the reliability and high-throughput of BLI platforms can assist in a multitude of vaccine research and immunotherapeutics applications. the authors developed four different bispecific antibodies combinations. increased broad and potent neutralization was observed with a bispecific antibody containing arms that bind to the different regions of HIV virus. the authors used an Octet RED system with an amine reactive biosensor. authors used human mAb against CHIKV immobilized on an AR2G biosensor and then used purified CHIKV VLPs to bind to the mAbs. mAbs were captured on the surface of the AR2G biosensor and the Chikungunya (CHIKV) VLPs allowed to bind to the mAbs. the Kd(virus) was then calculated as a function of the relative sugar loading for values ranging 0.05 to 0.95. the dip-and-read capability of BLI tends to favor whole virus and VLP applications over SPR instrumentations because BLI is not prone to some SPR-specific limitations. KV immobilized on an AR2G biosensor and then used purified CHIKV VLPs to bind to the mAbs. mAbs were captured on the surface of the AR2G biosensor and the Chikungunya (CHIKV) VLPs allowed to bind to the mAbs. the dip-and-read capability of BLI tends to favor whole virus and VLP applications over SPR instrumentations. some of the SPR specific-limitations include mass-transport limitations and artifacts caused by chemical microheterogeneity of the surface of the biosensor. aptamer pool enrichment is traditionally accessed by radio-labeling aptamers with either ATP [ 32P] for in vitro transcription or ATP [ 32P] for 5\u2032 end labeling. aptamers can bind to viral proteins to inhibit or block fusion, penetration, or replication. BLI technology has greatly assisted with vaccine research and development in recent years. it is possible to obtain detailed information from binding kinetics, specificity/affinity, immune responses, epitope mapping and vaccine titer and concentration. this makes BLI a very powerful technique to be adopted in any laboratory involved in the development and production of vaccines."}
