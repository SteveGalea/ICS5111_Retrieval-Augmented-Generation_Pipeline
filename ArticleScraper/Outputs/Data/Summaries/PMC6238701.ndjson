{"summary": "the African penguin (Spheniscus demersus) is considered an endangered species (BirdLife International 2015) there has been more than a 60% decrease in the population between 2001 and 2009. levels of breeding success were deemed inadequate to sustain the African penguin population. several parasites have been recorded from the african penguin. only the trematode Cardiocephaloides physalis has caused mortality in the penguin. bled on admission for rehabilitation to SANCCOB (Cape Town, Western Cape) collected from various Namibian colonies in 2009 and from areas in the western Cape from 2010 to 2013. bled on admission for rehabilitation to SANCCOB (Cape Town, Western Cape) all penguins sampled at breeding colonies were adults, with exception of 11 chicks and 1 juvenile sampled in the Western Cape 2007\u20132008 group. samples collected from penguins in the Namibia 2009 group were obtained within the first 3 days of admission to the centre. 186 male penguins (51%) and 179 female penguins (49%). serum clot activator tubes were centrifuged and transferred into separate eppendorf tubes. blood smears were prepared, air-dried, fixed in methanol and stained with modified Wright\u2013Giemsa stain. all slides were examined for blood parasites for 10 min using a 50 oil immersion lens with a 10 eyepiece. ovirus (ARV), infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), MG and MS were used to test different subsets of samples. a limited number of samples were submitted to Agrilabs (Pioneerfoods [Pty] Ltd, Malmesbury, South Africa) to be tested for infectious laryngotracheitis virus (ILTV), also known as gallid herpesvirus 1) through indirect ELISA. tested Not tested 0.00 37 Not tested Not tested Not tested Not tested 0.00 36 0.00 73 Newcastle Disease Virus HIA 2.04 98 3.00 100 0.00 67 0.00 21 0.00 153 1.14 439 Mycoplasma gallisepticum SPA 5.26 95 22.64 53 Not tested Not tested Not tested 2.50 40 0.00 65 Not tested Not tested 0.00 84 0.53 189 Mycoplasma synoviae SPA 9.47 95 1.72 58 Not tested Not tested Not man-whitney tests were used to compare haematological results between reference values and individuals that were seropositive for other pathogens. haematological results of individuals seropositive for other pathogens were not included in this analysis because of insufficient sample size.

DNA from coronaviruses has been detected in the tissues of beachcast carcasses of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) in Brazil. however, it is unclear whether these viruses were associated with disease. Coronaviruses such as IBV cause respiratory, intestinal and reproductive diseases in both domestic and wild birds. avian reovirus (Reoviridae) Antibodies against ARV were detected in wild african penguins sampled in Namibia and the western Cape. the birds were seronegative to the one-way neutralisation test, and it was unclear what role the virus played in their deaths. IBDV serotype 1 is endemic and widespread in Antarctic birds. no clinical signs of disease have been observed in any of the seropositive penguin species in the wild. wild african penguin chicks have presented herpesvirus-like respiratory infections. previous studies on other penguin species have failed to identify antibodies against this virus. SANCCOB stopped routinely marking all penguins before release into the wild in august 2005, but routinely vaccinated for NDV up until august 2008. there is no literature, to our knowledge, that determines how long the vaccination antibodies remain detectable in a penguin. mycoplasma sphenisci was described in an african penguin showing signs of upper respiratory tract disease in a North American aquarium. M. lipofaciens was identified from the lungs of a Fiordland penguin (Eudyptes pachyrhynchus) on the other hand, M. sphenisci and other Mycoplasma spp. have been detected in the faeces of apparently healthy penguins in Antarctica morphology was consistent with Babesia peircei and relapsing fever Borrelia. the prevalence of Babesia sp. in wild african penguins is similar to that observed in previous studies. higher serum levels of creatinine kinase and lower serum levels of uric acids and albumin indicate impairment of hepatic function. overall seroprevalence was relatively low (2.9%). aEV has been documented in domestic birds in south Africa. coronaviruses have been detected in the tissues of beachcast penguin carcasses of Magellanic penguins (Spheniscus magellanicus) in Brazil. the significance of this infection in penguins is unclear. s at lower latitudes conducted to date have failed to demonstrate exposure to AIV. however, this is unlikely to result from an absence of circulation of these viruses. antibodies against AIV subtypes other than H5 and H7 would have gone undetected. antibodies against IBDV have been demonstrated in penguins by studies using ELISA in Brazil and virus neutralisation tests in Crozet Archipelago. studies using agar-gel diffusion tests have failed to obtain positive results in south America. there were no positive samples in serology testing for ILTV (also known as gallid herpesvirus 1) despite previous evidence that African penguins are susceptible to herpesvirus-like infections. previous studies on other penguin species have also failed to identify antibodies against this virus. SANCCOB stopped routinely marking all penguins before release into the wild in 2005, but routinely vaccinated for NDV up until August 2008. there is no literature, to our knowledge, that determines how long the vaccination antibodies remain detectable in a penguin following vaccination. MG and MS potentially cause respiratory disease, sinusitis, conjunctivitis and synovitis in domestic and wild birds. mycoplasma sphenisci was described in an african penguin showing signs of upper respiratory tract disease in a North American aquarium. great white pelicans are known to feed on avian offal in agricultural areas. they could play a key role in spreading pathogens such as Mycoplasma spp. from domestic animals to seabirds. morphology was consistent with Babesia peircei and relapsing fever Borrelia. higher white blood cell counts in Babesia-infected penguins indicate an active inflammatory response to the parasite and/or a stress response. higher serum levels of creatinine kinase and lower serum levels of uric acids and albumin indicate impairment of hepatic function. disease is yet another significant threat to the species.
