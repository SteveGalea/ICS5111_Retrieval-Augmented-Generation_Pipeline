{"summary": "clusters of fatal pneumonia in adults were determined to be caused by a novel lineage C betacoronavirus (2c CoV) this was the first 2c CoV known to cause disease in humans and at the time of its discovery was most closely related to two known bat coronaviruses (2). epidemiologists identified an association between MERS infections in patients and their contact with dromedary camels. derived protein is responsible for host receptor recognition and membrane fusion (16) the S1 subunit contains the receptor binding domain and therefore has a specific role in defining host tropism (17) other processes are also important, such as the activation of the spike protein by host proteases (18) but the ability of S1 to bind with a host receptor is a critical step in the emergence pathway. a bat (identifier [ID] OTBA03-20130220) was trapped on 20 February 2013 in the Nkuringo area of Kisoro district, in southwestern Uganda. this area is an established settlement of villages comprising approximately 15,000 inhabitants. communities include subsistence farmers growing small crops, with some members working inside the national park or supporting tourism-related businesses. the oral swab and blood were negative. the near-full-length genome was assembled from 100-nucleotide (nt) Illumina single-end reads at an average depth of 26. only the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions were left incomplete. pairwise amino acid sequence identity of subunit 1 of spike protein of 2c CoVs Accession no. and/or isolate % identity for subunit 1. % identity for receptor binding domain. 3.4) 56.7 (61.1) 61.4 (61.2) KF186567, Al-Hasa1 43.5 (40.3) 44.4 (41.0) 43.9 (47.8) 61.4 (65.6) 61.2 (64.1) 56.5 (63.4) 56.7 (61.1) 61.4 (61.2) 99.9 (99.2) KJ477102, NRC-HKU205 43.7 (39.6) 44.4 (40.3) 43.8 (47.0) 43.9 (47.0) 61.1 (64.9) 6 0 68.3 98.4 98.4 EF065509, BatCoV HKU5-1 71.2 71.2 70.9 74.3 73.6 66.9 66.6 79.6 79.6 79.1 EF065512, BatCoV HKU5-5 71.7 71.7 71.4 74.5 73.9 66.9 66.6 79.9 79.4 97.9 KJ473821, SC2013 73.5 73.5 73.2 72.5 7 maximum likelihood phylogenetic reconstructions of 2c coronaviruses show that PREDICT/PDF-2180 and NeoCoV are consistently basal to, or form sister clades with, MERS-like CoV (human/camel strains) except in subunit 1 of the spike protein. the interaction between DPP4 Y322 and MERS D510 is abolished in the PREDICT/PDF-2180 prediction, where D510 is replaced by K510. this is a charge change from negative to positive. a change from R511 in MERS to D511 in PREDICT/PDF-2180 facilitates a potential interaction with Y322 to replace the hydrogen bond lost with K510. sg spike mRNAs confirmed replication of the recombinant virus. however, subsequent passages by supernatant transfer failed to reproduce the infection. the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike protein is unable to mediate cell entry in vero cells. viral RNA expression analysis indicated no evidence of viral replication following infection with the PREDICT/PDF-2180 chimeric virus. wild-type MERS-CoV induces robust replication as measured by plaque assay and viral-leader-containing transcripts. the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike is not likely to efficiently replicate in the human airway without further adaptation. the sampled bat weighed 3.0 g and had a forearm length of 25 mm. it was identified as Pipistrellus cf. hesperidus based on 95% sequence identity in the cytochrome b (Cytb) gene. the cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (CO1) was also sequenced. the hexanucleotide transcription regulatory sequence (AACGAA) was conserved and found in the same position as both MERS and NeoCoV upstream of each predicted ORF. Across the full genome, the sequence had 86.5% amino acid identity to MERS-CoV and 91% to NeoCoV.

ND, none detected; ND, none detected; WT, wild type. group C betacoronaviruses have now been identified in bats. the spike protein of this virus is distinct from the MERS-CoV spike. it appears unable to enter cells that express the functional receptor used by MERS-CoV. failure to assemble and release viral particles from the initial infection could also explain our results. the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike does not use DPP4 and is seemingly not competent for human infection. there is also evidence of positive selection in the bat DPP4 that would indicate the existence of a large diversity of (as-yet-unknown) DPP4-competent strains. no single correlate of pathogenicity or virulence has been determined for any viral family (50, 51) the approach used here is an important tool in characterizing the zoonotic potential of viral sequences detected in wildlife. it will also provide critical information on host and geographic variation in key viral traits, like potential host tropism. two broadly reactive consensus PCR assays targeting partial and nonoverlapping regions of the coronavirus ORF1b (containing the RdRp) were performed (53, 54) bands of the expected size were excised from 1% agarose, cloned into Strataclone PCR cloning vector, and sequenced to confirm detection. genome of PREDICT/PDF-2180 was mapped with Bowtie2 against the filtered data set to visualize depth and coverage in Integrated Genomics Viewer. genome of PREDICT/PDF-2180 was mapped with Bowtie2 against the filtered data set. we first aligned the amino acid sequences for 4KR0 (28) and the Uganda spike using Clustal Omega (60) we then used MODELLER (61) to create predicted structural coordinates for the Uganda spike based on the coordinates of 4KR0. the plasmids were sequence verified prior to the assembly of full-length recombinant DNAs. the MERS A to F inserts were restriction digested, resolved on 0.8% agarose gels, visualized, excised, and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit. full-length T7 transcripts were generated in vitro as described by the manufacturer. cDNA was reverse transcribed with a primer at the 3\u2032 end of the genome. cDNA was isolated for PCR using a reverse primer located in ORF5 and a forward primer located in the leader RNA sequence at the 5\u2032 end of the genome. cDNA was separated and visualized in 0.8% agarose gels. a bat (ID OTBA03-20130220) was caught with a mist net (3.8-mm mesh; Avinet, Inc.) according to established protocols and was released unharmed postsampling. standard morphometric measurements (weight and forearm length) and photographs were obtained to aid species identification. the resulting double-stranded cDNA was sheared to 200-bp (average) fragments using a Covaris focused ultrasonicator E210. the final library was quantified using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100. full genome and individual gene sequences were aligned with ClustalW. maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were constructed in PAUP*. nucleotide sequence similarity between MERS-like viruses was assessed. plasmids were ordered synthetically (Bio-Basic) to contain the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike ectodomain. the first 20 amino acids of the spike were retained and the PREDICT/PDF-2180 spike coding for amino acids 24 to 1298 was fused downstream of the MERS-CoV S glycoprotein signal peptidase domain. full-length T7 transcripts were generated in vitro as described by the manufacturer (Ambion; mMessage mMachine) with certain modifications (63) for MERS-CoV N transcripts, 1 g of plasmid DNA containing the N gene was transcribed by SP6 RNA polymerase with a 4:1 ratio of cap analog to GTP. cDNA products were separated and visualized in 0.8% agarose gels. wild-type and chimeric CoVs were cultured on vero E6 cells. human lungs were procured under university of North Carolina institutional review board-approved protocols."}
