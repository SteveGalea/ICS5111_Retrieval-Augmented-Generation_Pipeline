{"summary": "the complexities of +RNA Virus Cell Biology Positive-strand viruses replicate in the cytoplasm of the host cell in association with cytoplasmic membranes. they must enter cells, institute cytoplasmic replication factories, replicate genome RNA, express their genomes, sort and traffic proteins and RNA. to determine the mechanisms by which +RNA viruses navigate these steps may necessitate an understanding of cell biology processes as diverse as cytoplasmic organelle structure and membrane biogenesis. RCs of +RNA viruses are more akin to factories than molecular machines. +RNA genomes must function in RCs as templates for translation, minus-strand synthesis, and packaging into progeny virions. RCs also likely contain multiple cellular proteins. spherules appear to obey relative rules of size and protein and RNA content consistent with predictions based on immuno-EM and biophysical measurements. the spherules have open necks to the cell cytosol predicted to be sufficient for movement of RNA molecules. this power is derived from the fact that FHV expresses the single multifunctional Protein A. the study is important for the coV and +RNA virus cell biology field for several reasons. it suggests more common mechanisms between coronaviruses and other +RNA viruses, such as the Flaviviridae. the integration of novel approaches for high-resolution reconstruction of +RNA RCs is an exciting evolution of viral cell biology. the integration of novel approaches for high-resolution reconstruction of +RNA RCs is an exciting evolution of viral cell biology. e organizing centers have been implicated in formation and functions of pericentriolar sites of virus assembly and replication. the level of resolution and understanding of +RNA RC formation and function is rapidly increasing. new technologies are being developed to understand how \u201csimple\u201d +RNA viruses can usurp and transform the intracellular architecture in a rapid and comprehensive manner."}
