{"summary": "the study was performed to determine whether asymptomatic or mild infection attributable to SARS-CoV was common in HCWs in this outbreak at Prince of Wales Hospital. a screening clinic was instituted to care for hospital staff with symptoms suggestive of or suspected to be SARS. asymptomatic staff or those without compatible symptoms were also invited to participate in this study. assay was successfully used for serodiagnosis of SARS in patients in our hospital. titers of >320 developed in acutely ill SARS patients 4 weeks after onset of illness. the mean age of these HCWs was 40 years (range 20\u201360), and 75% were female. the current global outbreak of SARS is associated with a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which is phylogenetically distinct from other known members of the virus family (Coronaviridae) and genus (6\u20138). the full clinical spectrum of this novel infection in humans has not yet been defined. a large proportion of the population remains susceptible. a major outbreak may occur when the virus is introduced by highly infectious sources."}
