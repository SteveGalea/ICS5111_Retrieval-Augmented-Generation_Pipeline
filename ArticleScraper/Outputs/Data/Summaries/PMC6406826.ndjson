{"summary": "oncolytic adenoviruses (Ad) are a family of non-enveloped DNA viruses. the viral capsid is an icosahedron composed of hexon and penton base proteins. initial binding of these viruses to cells is mediated through interactions between the viral fiber protein and various cell receptors. the effectiveness of oncolytic adenoviral therapy is greatly dependent on the binding domains of these viral vectors. the majority of conventional Ad-based vectors utilize the human Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) serotype. the majority of conventional Ad-based vectors utilize the human Adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) serotype. human adenovirus can effectively transduce a wide range of non-human cell lines. human adenovirus tends to produce productive viral progeny in human cells only. these animals have been studied extensively and are known to support Ad5 replication. this model has enabled the evaluation of Ad behavior in situ with natural host immune responses. hamsters have been used for conducting pre-clinical toxicity studies for many Ad5-based adenoviral vectors. in vivo studies in immunocompetent Yorkshire pigs confirmed that the pig is a valid preclinical model for evaluating performance of both Ad5 and Ad5/3 replication competent vectors. the pig is a valid preclinical model for evaluating performance of both Ad5 and Ad5/3 replication competent vectors. porcine cells and human cell controls showed opposite trend of Ad5/3 superiority. binding with Ad5/3 virus in murine Pan02 and Hepa1-6 was approximately 40-fold and 65-fold lower respectively when compared to human A549. pig cells showed stronger binding of Ad5/3 vectors than Ad5/3 vectors. Murine Pan02 and Hepa1-6 showed significantly lower levels of transgene expression. hamster HapT1 and HP1 cell lines showed very poor gene transfer. all four rodent cell lines had negligible luciferase activity with Ad5/3 vectors, nearly 4 orders of magnitude lower than in A549. the cells were infected with low titers (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 viral particle/cell) for 8 days to allow at least a few cycles of virus replication. the surviving cells were stained with crystal violet. iter of 100 vp/cell and incubated for 4, 6, and 10 days. no significant cytolysis in murine cells after Ad5/3 infection. canine cells showed no significant cell death with either viral vector. rodent and porcine cells were infected with Ad5 and Ad5/3 viruses. Luc activity was determined on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 post infection. only porcine cells showed time-dependent increase in Luc activity. Luc activity reached relatively low levels when these same cells were infected with Ad5/3 viruses (HP1 100 vp; Day 1\u2013909 RLU, Day 4\u2013213,239 RLU) porcine PK15 cells demonstrated replication-dependent gene expression after infection with both Ad5 and Ad5/3 viruses. the percentage of NIS-positive PK15 cells after Ad5/3 infection was 4-fold greater than that observed after Ad5-fiber unmodified infection (p 0.05). these in vitro experiments are the first to demonstrate the ability of porcine cells to support replication-dependent gene expression associated with Ad5/3-retargeted vectors. pigs were injected with a single dose of Ad5E3-Luc or Ad5/3E3-Luc at 3 1012 vp via ear vein. Luc activity was detected in lungs and spleen. no significant replication-dependent Luc expression was observed in liver tissues. tol dehydrogenase (SDH) showed mild elevation at day 7 in the Ad5 group. no microscopic changes in the kidney or liver were seen upon necropsy 7 days post infection. this pneumonia was observed in both experimental and control groups. 54 Total protein (g/dL) 5.3 5.6 5.5 5.6 4.5 5.1 5.3 5.6 5.5 5.1 5.6 5.6 7.9\u20138.9 Albumin (g/dL) 3.5 3.7 3.7 3.7 4 3.5 3.3 3.6 3.7 3.7 4 3.5 3.3 3.6 3.7 1.9\u20133.3 Urea N (mg/dL) 10 14 9 9 7 11 7 9 6 12 8 8 10\u201330 Creatinine (mg/d 2.4 2.5 2.8 2.6 2.3 2.5 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.9 0.37\u20130.51 Urea/Creat ratio 11.1 15.6 12.9 11.3 11.7 18.3 14 12.9 7.5 15 13.3 13.3 N/A ALP (VALKP) (U/L) 221 205 195 187 259 190 164 203 250 167 190 197 118\u2013395 ALT (GPT) (U/L) 59 61 70 75 viral binding was quantified using a virus-cell binding assay. cells were infected with virus and then incubated at 4 \u00b0C to prevent internalization. total cell DNA was analyzed with PCR. the porcine cells supported the highest levels of Ad5/3 binding. mouse, hamster, and canine cells showed superior binding with Ad5 vectors versus Ad5/3. porcine cells and human cell controls showed the opposite trend of Ad5/3 superiority. mouse, hamster, canine, and porcine cells were infected with replication-deficient Luciferase expressing vectors. chimeric Ad5/3 fiber (Ad5/3CMV-Luc) was used to infect the cell lines. then Luc activity was used as a measure of gene transfer. the cells were infected with low titers (0.01, 0.1, 1, and 10 viral particle/cell) for 8 days to allow at least a few cycles of virus replication. the cells were stained with crystal violet (Figure 3). porcine PK15 cells (1\u201310 vp/cell) and human controls (0.01\u201310 vp/cell) all cell lines were plated and infected with Ad5 and Ad5/3 vectors at a titer of 100 vp/cell and incubated for 4, 6, and 10 days. MTS cell viability assay was then performed to quantify cell death. hamster and porcine cells were infected with replication-competent vectors. expression of the reporter transgene follows a late profile due to control by the major late promoter. Luc activity was determined on days 1, 2, 3 and 4 post infection. Luc activity reached relatively low levels when these same cells were infected with both Ad5 and Ad5/3 viruses (HP1 100 vp; Day 1\u2013174 RLU, Day 4\u201349,432 RLU) however, Luc activity reached relatively low levels when these same cells were infected with both. in vitro experiments, we injected immunocompetent pigs with 3 1012 vp of fiber-unmodified (Ad5-E3-Luc) or Ad5/3-modified (Ad5/3-E3-Luc) Luc expressing replicative virus. adenoviral DNA was detected in the pigs\u2019 lung and spleen (>1000 AdE4 copy/g DNA) adenoviral vectors can replicate in live swine after systemic administration. pigs were injected with a single dose of Ad5E3-Luc or Ad5/3-E3-Luc at 3 1012 vp via ear vein. ferase (AST) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) showed some elevation in the Ad5/3 group on day 4. the liver damage marker sorbitol dehydrogenase (SDH) showed mild elevation at day 7. no microscopic changes in the kidney or liver were seen upon necropsy 7 days post infection. 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.1 0\u20131 Cholesterol (mg/dL) 91 71 78 88 72 83 89 80 102 106 110 94 36\u201354 Total protein (g/dL) 5.3 5.6 5.5 5.6 4.5 5.1 5.3 5.6 5.5 5.1 5.6 5.6 7.9\u20138.9 Albumin (g/d 1.8 1.9 1.6 1.6 1.2 1.4 1.6 1.6 2 1.8 2 1.9 5.3\u20136.4 A/G Ratio 1.9 1.9 2.4 2.5 2.8 2.6 2.3 2.5 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.8 1.9 0.37\u20130.51 Urea/Creat ratio 11.1 15.6 12.9 11.3 11.7 18.3 14 12.9 7.5 15 13.3 13.3 N/A ALP (U/L) 0.0 10.4 9.7 9.1 9.8 9.8 11.5 9.7 10.9 11.0 11.0 10.4 10.1 10\u201316 Hematocrit (%) 32.7 32.5 29.7 28.7 31.8 34.8 31.1 35.2 36.8 33.0 32.1 30.6 32\u201350 Platelets (103/L) 17.5 20.9 15.0 15.5 11.2 14.0 10.7 11.0 14.0 20.6 14.5 13.2 11\u201322 Neutrophils (103/L) 6.7 11.9 7.4 toxicology studies require adenovirus replication-permissive animal models. we have performed a comparative analysis of the replication properties of chimeric Ad5/3 vector in various non-human cell lines. the tropism modified viruses uniformly underperformed their wild type counterparts in both of these species. hamster cells infected with Ad5/3 showed 40 to 80-fold lower virus biding and at least 5000-fold lower transduction efficiency. the functional binding assay provides the most accurate evaluation of the binding ability of Ad5/3 vectors in non-human species. infected porcine cells were significantly more efficient at expression of replication dependent NIS expression in the Ad5/3 vs. Ad5 cells. human adenoviruses possess an intrinsic selectivity for replication in cancer tissues and tend to show an increase in virus infectivity towards malignant cells. liver biopsies were taken from pigs to analyze both viral DNA and replication-driven luciferase expression. no liver toxicity was observed in pigs despite a very high dose (3 1012 vp) of systemically administrated virus. human lung adenocarcinoma (A549), pancreatic adenocarcinoma, Pan02 and hepatoma, Hepa1-6; Syrian hamster pancreatic cancers, HP1 and HapT1. all human and non-human cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 under humidified conditions. all human and non-human cells were cultured in EMEM. adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) and the chimeric vectors with the Ad5/3-modified fiber (Ad5/3) were used in this study. the chimeric vectors had a chimeric fiber composed of the Ad5 shaft and the Ad3 knob. in vitro analysis of Ad5 and Ad5/3 Binding Ability Cells (5.0 104 cells/well) grown in 24 well plates and infected with replication-deficient Ads expressing luciferase. PCR using primers for the AdE4 gene was used to determine the bound virus in total DNA. infection medium was removed, and infected cells cultured in appropriate growth medium. human, mouse, hamster and porcine cells were infected at (0, 0.01, 0.1, 10, 100 vp per cell) for 7\u201312 days. cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 10 minutes. the data is represented as relative light units (RLU) for quantitative analysis of NIS gene expression, we used a replication competent Ad5E3-NIS, and identical counterpart Ad5/3E3-NIS. unbound virus was washed away, and infection media replaced. cells were analyzed on a BD 8-color Flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) the data is expressed as the % of NIS expressing cells in 10,000 events. chemistry analysis was performed on blood serum at Marshfield laboratory (Madison, WI, USA) the clinical pathology and histopathology analyses were performed by an independent Board-Certified Veterinary Pathologists (Experimental Surgical Services, Surgery Department, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA) all human and non-human cells were cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. growth medium was supplemented with 5\u201310% fetal bovine serum, 1% penicillin-streptomycin. adenovirus type 5 (Ad5) and the chimeric vectors with the Ad5/3-modified fiber (Ad5/3) were used in this study. we used replication-competent wild type Ad5 (Ad5Wt) and its retargeted counterpart with the Ad5/3-modified fiber (Ad5/3Wt) in vitro analysis of Ad5 and Ad5/3 Binding Ability Cells (5.0 104 cells/well) grown in 24 well plates. infected with replication-deficient Ads expressing luciferase (Ad5CMV-Luc and Ad5/3CMV-Luc) at 500 vp/cell for 2 h. infection medium was removed, and infected cells cultured in appropriate growth medium. human, mouse, hamster and porcine cells were infected at (0, 0.01, 0.1, 10, 100 vp per cell) for 7\u201312 days. cells were fixed in 10% buffered formalin for 10 minutes and stained with a 1% crystal violet in 70% ethanol. porcine cells were cultured in chamber slides (25,000 cells per well) and infected with Ad5- and Ad5/3E3-NIS at 10 vp/cell for 24 h. unbound virus was washed away, and cells fixed in 4% Paraformaldehyde Solution. stained cells were analyzed on a BD 8-color Flow cytometer. the data is expressed as the % of NIS expressing cells in 10,000 events. the clinical pathology and histopathology analyses were performed by an independent Board-Certified Veterinary Pathologists (Experimental Surgical Services, Surgery Department, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, MN, USA). results with a two-tailed p-value 0.05 were considered statistically significant. we hope that these data will help to foster clinical translation of oncolytic adenoviruses including those with retargeted tropism."}
