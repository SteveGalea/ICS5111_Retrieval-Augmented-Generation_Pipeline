{"summary": "four hundred forty-nine samples of nasopharyngeal secretions from children under 3 y of age with LRTIs were analysed by a quantitative HCoV-NL63-specific real-time PCR. the samples were collected from hospitalised patients and outpatients from December 1999 to October 2001. the viral RNA was more prevalent in samples from outpatients (7.9%) than from hospitalised patients. respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus (INF), parainfluenza virus (PIV) and human metapneumovirus are among the most frequent diseases in the first years of life. none of the known pathogens is detected in a substantial number of cases. HCoV-NL63 is circulating among humans with respiratory disease in the Netherlands. a subset of the PRI.DE samples were analysed by a HCoV-NL63-specific quantitative real-time RT-PCR. patients from Hamburg, Bochum, Freiburg, and Dresden are included from paediatric practices (outpatients) or hospitals (inpatients) RNA was extracted from 220 l of NPS using the Qiamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in 50 l of preheated RNase free water (80 \u00b0C) for 5 min. the remaining RNA was stored in a 70 \u00b0C freezer. of the total of 3,654 NPSs that were collected within the PRI.DE study, half were randomly assigned to this study. randomisation was performed via bars represent the percentage of HCoV-NL63-positive samples per month. RNA (5 l) was reverse-transcribed in a final volume of 20 l for 20 min at 50 \u00b0C followed by denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min. a PCR product of HCoV-NL63 was cloned in plasmid TOPO PCR II. RNA was in vitro transcribed using the ampliScribe T7 high Yield Transcription Kit. the synthesised RNA was analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis. odds ratios present probability of croup in children infected with HCoV-NL63. odds ratios present probability of croup in children not infected with HCoV-NL63. RNA was extracted from 220 l of NPS using the Qiamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and eluted in 50 l of preheated RNase free water (80 \u00b0C) for 5 min. the remaining RNA was stored in a 70 \u00b0C freezer. of the total 3,654 NPSs that were collected within the PRI.DE study, half were randomly assigned to this study. the only period from which only a few samples were analysed was December 1999 to March 2000. written informed consent was obtained from the parents of all participants. bars represent the percentage of HCoV-NL63-positive samples per month. a PCR product of HCoV-NL63 was cloned in plasmid TOPO PCR II using the TA-cloning kit of Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California, United States) RNA was in vitro transcribed using the AmpliScribe T7 High Yield Transcription Kit (Epicentre Technologies, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) following the manufacturer's instructions. two independently transcribed RNA samples were adjusted to 109 260 RNA copies per RT-PCR reaction correspond to a viral load of approximately 104 RNA copies/ml NPS. 104 copies/ml was taken as the lower limit for accurate quantification. odds ratios present probability of croup in children infected with HCoV-NL63. the ages of the HCoV-NL63-infected children ranged from 0 to 2.9 y. the ages of the HCoV-NL63-infected children ranged from 0 to 2.9 y. peaks were observed in December 2000 (14% of patients positive) and February 2001 (12% of patients positive). HCoV-NL63 co-infections with PIV3 were exclusively present in the outpatient group (16%). the RNA load of HCoV-NL63 differed considerably from less than 225 copies/ml (but detectable) to 9 107 copies/ml aspirate. the median viral load in the two groups is indicated (in red) together with the p-value. onset of disease was 2 d, whereas the median interval was 6 d for the group with the lower viral load. difference between high and low viral load group was not statistically significant. in 20 of the 49 HCoV-NL63-positive samples no other virus (RSV, PIV, or INF) could be detected. more HCoV-NL63 infections were found in the outpatients (31 patients, 7.9%) than in hospitalised patients (18 patients, 3.2%, p = 0.003) the ages of the HCoV-NL63-infected children ranged from 0 to 2.9 y. HCoV-NL63 co-infections with RSV-A and PIV3 were apparent in 29 of the 49 HCoV-NL63-positive samples. double infections were observed in the hospitalised patients with HCoV-NL63. the HCoV-NL63 load in the singly infected group (n = 20) was on average high, although there were a few samples with a load below 10,000 copies/ml (n = 6) for the group with a high viral load (>10,000 copies/ml), the median time of sampling after onset of disease was 2 d, whereas the median interval was 6 d for the group with the lower viral load. HCoV-NL63 was detectable in 17.4% of all samples from croup patients. the chance of croup is estimated to be 6.6 times higher in HCoV-NL63-positive LRTI patients than in HCoV-NL63-negative LRTI patients. HCoV-NL63 is more frequently found in the outpatient group with LRTI (7.9%) than among hospitalised patients (3.2%). HCoV-NL63 infection seems to be less pathogenic than RSV infection. a preferential occurrence in boys has been described for other respiratory diseases including asthma [13], and human coronavirus infections have previously been associated with exacerbations of asthma [14] it will therefore be of interest to study this link for HCoV-NL63. results from the PRI.DE study indicated that co-infections with multiple respiratory viruses are rare (1.5% of all samples tested; [8]) the HCoV-NL63 load was found to vary with respect to the time of sampling relative to the time of disease onset. this most likely reflects viral clearance by the immune system. an initial HCoV-NL63 infection may set the stage for a subsequent RSV infection. the HCoV-NL63 infection may already be under control by the immune system. HCoV-NL63 is a human respiratory virus that should be added to the list of pathogens that can cause numerous LRTIs in young children. most infections are caused by viruses, the best known of which are respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza virus (INF). researchers looked at 949 samples taken from children with lower respiratory infections in Germany between 1999 and 2001. they found that the virus HCoV-NL63 was more common in outpatients than inpatients, and that 40% of children infected with only this virus had croup compared with around 6% of children who did not carry the virus. this virus may be the third most common cause of lower respiratory infections in this group. a new virus known as HCoV-NL63 has been discovered. it is a human coronavirus (SARS is another coronavirus) this virus was present in a child with bronchiolitis. researchers wanted to know whether the virus was associated with other respiratory diseases."}
