{"summary": "infected individuals who succumb to filovirus infection exhibit dysregulated immune responses. this appears to result from several factors, including viral mediated impairment of early innate immune responses. a well-regulated cytokine response early in the course of the infection may be critical to the outcome of the disease. the first reported MARV outbreak occurred in Germany and Yugoslavia in 1967. it was caused by infected african green monkeys imported from Uganda. recent outbreaks of MARV in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in 1998\u20132000 and in angola in 2004 were associated with fatality rates up to 90%. there has been renewed interest given the potential for using filoviruses in bioterrorism attacks. a single stranded non-segmented RNA genome of filoviruses is of negative polarity and contains seven monocistronic genes. it is associated with four viral proteins, the nucleoprotein NP which enwraps the viral RNA, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L, the polymerase cofactor VP35, and the transcription factor VP30. the precursor preGP is cleaved in the trans Golgi network by furin or a furin-like protease resulting in two disulfide-linked subunits, GP1 and GP2 [37]. EBOV genomes encode an additional protein, the nonstructural soluble form of the glycoprotein, sGP. sGP is not incorporated into viral particles, but is secreted from infected cells. infected hepatocytes and adrenal cortical cells can be detected a day or two after finding infected macrophages. secondary target cells include fibroblasts and endothelial cells. the presence of these cell types in virtually all organs may account for the observed filovirus pantropism. the structure of sinusoids and sinuses in the liver and spleen allows for the direct migration of filoviruses from the blood stream. migration of infected monocytes from blood vessels may deliver the virus into connective tissue where it infects fibroblasts, which then spread progeny viruses by their protrusions to sites far from the main body of the infected cell. the single stranded non-segmented RNA genome of filoviruses is of negative polarity and contains seven monocistronic genes. it is associated with four viral proteins, the nucleoprotein NP which enwraps the viral RNA, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase L, the polymerase cofactor VP35, and the transcription factor VP30. the four nucleocapsid proteins are required for replication and transcription of the EBOV genomes encode an additional protein, the nonstructural soluble form of the glycoprotein, sGP. sGP is encoded by the fourth gene, but is translated from non-edited mRNA species, while the membrane-bound GP is the result of mRNA editing during transcription. sGP is not incorporated into viral particles, but is secreted from infected cells. guinea pigs can be detected within 24 h after intraperitoneal infection. infected hepatocytes and adrenal cortical cells can be detected a day or two after finding infected macrophages. secondary target cells also include fibroblasts and endothelial cells. filoviruses are able to infect multiple cell types in vivo and in cell culture. migration of infected monocytes from blood vessels may deliver the virus into connective tissue where it infects fibroblasts. this then spreads progeny viruses by their protrusions to sites far from the main body of the infected cell. some cells are more susceptible to infection than others, and some are not permissive to infection. a number of cellular proteins have been implicated in filovirus entry. the folate receptor has been suggested to be a significant filovirus receptor. T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain 1 (TIM-1) has been suggested as a receptor for EBOV and MARV GP. TIM-1 is not expressed by the primary targets of filoviruses, macrophages and DCs, but is expressed on mucosal epithelial cells. fusion of the viral and cellular membrane is mediated by the fusogenic cleavage product GP2 [98] to initiate fusion, the proteolytic cleavage of GP1 by the endosomal proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L is mandatory [99\u2013101]. Interestingly, the cathepsin dependence of virus entry seems to be cell-type specific. amplification of the viral genome and assembly of newly synthesized nucleocapsids occur in highly organized regions in the cytoplasm, the viral inclusions. the appearance of granular material of average electron density in the cytoplasm of the infected cells at 12 h (MARV) and 9 h (ZEBOV) post infection is the first morphological sign of viral replication. the morphological characteristics of filovirus replication in animal cells in vivo are identical to those observed in cell culture. the morphological characteristics of filovirus replication in animal cells in vivo are identical to those observed in cell culture. MARV-infected guinea pig shows an infected macrophage (B) and an infected hepatocyte (C). arrows show vacuolization of endoplasmic reticulum cisterns in cells undergoing non-apoptotic cell death. a recent electron tomography study of MARV-infected cells convincingly reconciled the results into a single model. the formation of such long filamentous particles (700\u2013900 nm or more) is certainly challenging for the infected cells. the release of infectious filamentous MARV from cultured cells has been reported to peak at early time points post infection (1\u20132 days p.i.) a number of cellular proteins have been implicated in filovirus entry. it is not clear whether there is a \u201cprimary\u201d receptor for these viruses. a number of cellular proteins have been implicated in filovirus entry. TIM-1 is not expressed by the primary targets of filoviruses, macrophages and DCs. it is expressed on mucosal epithelial cells, whose role in infection is not clear yet. the TAM receptor Axl serves as a co-receptor for EBOV entry. fusion of the viral and cellular membrane is mediated by the fusogenic cleavage product GP2 [98] to initiate fusion, the proteolytic cleavage of GP1 by the endosomal proteases cathepsin B and cathepsin L is mandatory [99\u2013101] the cathepsin dependence of virus entry seems to be cell-type specific. amplification of viral genome and assembly of newly synthesized nucleocapsids occur in highly organized regions in the cytoplasm, the viral inclusions. the appearance of granular material of average electron density in the cytoplasm of the infected cells at 12 h (MARV) and 9 h (ZEBOV) post infection (p.i.) is the first morphological sign of viral replication. the morphological characteristics of filovirus replication in animal cells in vivo are identical to those observed in cell culture. the morphological characteristics of filovirus replication in animal cells in vivo are identical to those observed in cell culture. infected macrophage (B) and an infected hepatocyte (C). NP and matrix protein VP40 accumulate in the viral inclusions. filoviral VP40 protein is the major player in viral budding. a recent electron tomography study of MARV-infected cells reconciled the results into a single model. the formation of such long filamentous particles (700\u2013900 nm or more) is certainly challenging for the infected cells and may lead to membrane perturbation in the cells. different types of cell death, including apoptosis, necrosis and autophagy, can be described by different morphological and biochemical characteristics. apoptosis is characterized by shrinking of the dying cell, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and final fragmentation of the cell in apoptotic bodies. apoptosis is characterized by activation of caspases. characteristic features of non-apoptotic cell death, such as vacuolization, swelling, and lack of chromatin condensation can be seen in Figures 3E,F. some studies describe apoptotic cell death in filovirus infection. infected cells, including macrophages, DCs, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells, do not undergo apoptosis [47\u201350,55,60,62,63,69,138]. infected cells, including macrophages, DCs, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells, do not undergo apoptosis [47\u201350,55,60,62,63,69,138]. infected hepatocytes develop necrosis not related to the formation of inflammatory foci. the liver is a major target organ for filovirus infection. necrotic hepatocytes appear 3\u20134 days p.i. in numbers that depend on the infectious dose. infected apoptotic cells reported in most studies raises the question if filoviruses manipulate signaling pathways involved in apoptosis or cell survival. a recent study showed that EBOV entry leads to the activation of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway very early in infection, resulting in the activation of Rac1, a regulator of endocytosis and vesicular trafficking. viral response is initiated by a cellular detection process mediated by various cellular pattern recognition receptors that specifically recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) a prominent filovirus PAMP are the 5\u2032triphosphate ends of the genomic RNA which can be sensed by RIG-I. however, in cells infected with EBOV, the induction of the type I IFN response via RIG-I activation is blocked by the polymerase cofactor VP35. antiviral protein dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) senses dsRNA and is a main regulator of IFN signaling and apoptosis. dsRNA is formed during replication and transcription of multiple RNA and DNA viruses. it is considered to be a major PAMP in viral infection. a recent study by leung et al. suggests that cells expressing EBOV GP are less prone to the inhibitory effects of VP35 EBOV than cells relying on RIG-like signaling pathways. the cytopathic domain within GP1 has been mapped to the so-called mucin-like domain, which is sufficient to cause detachment and downregulation of cellular surface proteins. a recent study has questioned the involvement of dynamin in GP-induced CPE. GP has also been shown to modulate the ERK/MAPK signaling cascade by reducing ERK2 activation. it has been suggested that ERK2 signaling cascades are involved in GP-mediated cytopathic effects. GP has been shown to induce a specific form of apoptosis, anoikis, in primary human cardiac microvascular endothelial cells. THP-1 cells, a human monocyte\u2013macrophage-derived cell line, did not undergo cell death upon GP expression. another group has shown that GP-induced cell death is non-apoptotic. apoptosis of non-infected lymphocytes is not unique to filoviruses. the apoptosis of non-infected lymphocytes is not unique to filoviruses. apoptosis of non-infected lymphocytes is not unique to filoviruses. cytopenia brought about bystander apoptosis is thought to contribute to the generalized immunosuppression that accompanies some viral infections. the best known example of bystander lymphocyte apoptosis in viral infections is in CD4 T cells during HIV infection. however, extrinsic and intrinsic pathways appear to be involved. EBOV-infected cells may secrete TRAIL and increased levels of soluble Fas have been detected in some EBOV-infected non-human primates. this could trigger conventional extrinsic pathways of apoptosis in susceptible cells, including T cells. co-inhibitory molecules such as programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) are upregulated on infected DCs. programmed death 1 (PD-1) may be upregulated on CD8 T cells in EBOV infections. the interaction of these molecules could lead to apoptosis. cell death is characterized by shrinking of dying cell, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and final fragmentation of the cell in apoptotic bodies. apoptosis or programmed cell death is characterized by shrinking of dying cell, plasma membrane blebbing, nuclear condensation, and final fragmentation of the cell in apoptotic bodies. autophagy is a conserved pathway of eukaryotic cells for recycling cellular components. extensive cellular stress can lead to autophagic or type II cell death. cell culture, filovirus infection leads to a clear cytopathic effect (CPE) the severity of the observed CPE is dependent on the virus species and the cell line used. some studies describe apoptotic cell death for isolated primary human macrophages infected with ZEBOV or Bundibugyo [136,137] apoptosis of hepatocytes has been observed in a lethal mouse model for ZEBOV. it is not clear if the apoptotic hepatocytes were infected. apoptosis of hepatocytes has been observed in a lethal mouse model for ZEBOV. changes in the host cells coincident with changes in the progeny virus morphology and infectivity. the striking lack of infected apoptotic cells reported in most studies raises the question if filoviruses manipulate signaling pathways involved in apoptosis or cell survival. filteroviruses are known to interfere with antiviral signaling pathways. innate immune response to filovirus infection and viral countermeasures are the main subject of another review article in this issue. antiviral protein dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) senses dsRNA and is a main regulator of IFN signaling and apoptosis. PKR is not activated in ZEBOV-infected cells, and VP35 actively block PKR activation. EBOV VP35 was found to interfere with the maturation of DCs induced by lipopolysaccharide, an agonist of TLR4 [168] VP35 also inhibits the induction of IFN in murine DCs after treatment with CpG DNA, an agonist for TLR9 [169]. a recent study by leung et al. suggests that cells utilizing TLR-mediated antiviral pathways are less prone to the inhibitory effects of VP35 mucin-like domain is a highly O- and N-glycosylated serine-threonine-rich region of about 150 amino acids in length. it is sufficient to cause detachment and downregulation of cellular surface proteins. GP-induced cytotoxic effects are caused by the interaction of GP with the GTPase dynamin. there is some debate over the ability of GP to induce cell death. some groups reported that expression of GP does not lead to cell disruption. others observed cell death [171,175,179] VP35 is able to block various signaling pathways involved in antiviral response to viral infection. it is conceivable that VP35 also interferes with cellular signaling pathways involved in GP-induced cellular stress. it remains puzzling that MARV GP does not seem to be cytotoxic when expressed in the absence of other viral proteins, although it is as highly glycosylated as EBOV GP. the temporal modulation of PI3K activation during viral infection is critical. PI3K activation during entry leads to the activation of Rac1. late in infection, PI3K activation prevents the induction of premature apoptosis. antiviral protein dsRNA-dependent protein kinase R (PKR) senses dsRNA and is a main regulator of IFN signaling and apoptosis. PKR phosphorylates the translation initiation factor eIF2 leading to translational arrest and apoptosis. VP35 has been shown to block PKR activation in EBOV-infected cells. it is not known if inhibition of PKR in EBOV-infected cells blocks apoptosis. toll-like receptors are another important group of PRRs. expression of GP leads to a general downregulation of cell surface proteins. GP expression in explanted blood vessels resulted in endothelial cell loss. cytopathic domain within GP1 is cleaved in two subunits, GP1 and GP2. ectopically expressed GP containing the mucin-like domain accumulates in the ER. GP lacking the mucin-like domain is distributed throughout the cell. it also induces cytopathic effects by enhancing the permeability of the plasma membrane. the membrane-anchored full-length GP is synthesized from an edited version of the GP mRNA. the mutant was significantly more cytopathogenic than wild-type virus. VP35 is able to block various signaling pathways involved in GP-induced cellular stress. apoptosis of non-infected lymphocytes is not unique to filoviruses. it has been reported in a number of viral infections, including lymphocyte choriomeningitis virus [189], human immunodeficiency virus [190], human herpesvirus 6 [191] and Vaccinia virus infections [192,194]. despite years of study, the mechanisms of depletion remain controversial. the majority of lymphocytes that are depleted are uninfected. both viral proteins released from infected cells and host-derived proteins have been suggested to contribute to CD4 T cell death. it is unclear which of these mechanisms account for the majority of apoptosis during HIV infection. increased expression levels of TRAIL and Fas mRNA have been observed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells of infected non-human primates. these could trigger conventional extrinsic pathways of apoptosis in susceptible cells, including T cells. cell proliferation and recent findings suggest this may be due to induction of apoptosis via PD-L1 binding. this mechanism is unlikely to explain the generalized lymphopenia observed during filovirus infection. a 17-mer in filovirus GPs has been reported to induce lymphocyte death and suppression of cytokine responses. we remain ignorant in our understanding of the mechanisms that impact the innate and adaptive immune system and modulate inflammatory responses during infection. these avenues of inquiry will be crucial for us to have a more complete understanding of the pathogenesis of filoviral disease."}
