{"summary": "pigs, which serve as \u2018mixing vessels\u2019 because of their susceptibility to infection by both human and avian influenza viruses, may be a pandemic threat to public health. vaccines may not be effective in preventing against diverse viral strains, manifesting as less immunogenic, or acting with inadequate speed, to combat newly-emerging seasonal or potentially pandemic strains. traditional protein-based immunization has difficulty in generating mAbs against conformation-sensitive targets. native proteins can be expressed in vivo when delivered in form of DNA as an immunogen, which does not require the process of protein production or purification. e/Guangdong/LM/2004 (SW/GD/04) (H1N1) and A/Swine/Harbin/2009 (SW/HRB/09) (H1N1) the viruses were propagated in 10-day-old specific-pathogen free (SPF) embryonated chicken eggs or in Madin\u2013Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) plasmid pCIneo-HA was cloned into pCI-neo using specific primers. the resulting plasmid was purified using a Qiaminiprep kit (Qiagen) the extracted plasmid was identified by using a double digest of Nhe I and Xho I. Isotypes of the obtained mAbs were determined by using a mouse immunoglobulin isotyping kit. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) test was performed to evaluate mAbs reactivity against SW/GD/04 as described previously. Western blot was used to examine whether anti-HA mAbs recognize the HA protein. 1 g of purified SW/GD/04 virus was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE or native PAGE. the membranes were probed with different mAbs, followed by a secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody. a total of 40 six-week-old SPF BALB/c mice were used to evaluate the protective efficacy of mAb 8C6. mice were pretreated intramuscularly with mAb 8C6 (two group) or negative ascetic fluids (two group) at a dose of 20 g per mg of mouse body weight before the viral challenge. mice were intranasally challenged with homologous virus SW/GD/04 or heterologous virus SW/HRB/09 MDCK cells were cultured in Dulbecco\u2019s modified essential medium (DMEM) containing 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (Hyclone, UT, USA) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C and in a 5% (v/v) CO2 atmosphere. each dilution was done in five repetitions. plasmid pCIneo-HA was purified using a Qiaminiprep kit (Qiagen) the resulting plasmid was identified by using a double digest of Nhe I and Xho I. plasmids were transformed into TOP10 competent cells. hemagglutination inhibition test was performed to evaluate mAbs reactivity against SW/GD/04. 25 L of serial two-fold dilutions of the purified ascetic fluids were mixed with four HA units of virus in hemagglutination plates and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min. each mAb was repeated three times. GD/04 virus was subjected to 10% SDS-PAGE or native PAGE. the membranes were probed with different mAbs, followed by a secondary HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD, USA) the ascetic fluids produced from the injection of SP2/0 myeloma cells were used as a negative control. mice were intranasally challenged with homologous virus SW/GD/04 or heterologous virus SW/HRB/09. three mice per subgroup were euthanized on day 3 post-challenge. samples were collected for virus titration in eggs. five mAbs against HA were selected for subcloning at least three times. positive hybridomas were used to produce mAbs in mice. concentrations of immunoglobulin ranged from 8.5 to 265.8 g/mL. five mAbs showed strong specific reactions to SW/GD/04-infected MDCK cells. no immuno-reactivity was observed in normal MDCK cells. mAbs 9D6, 8C4, 8A4, 8C6, and 8B1 reacted strongly with the 70 kDa HA proteins of SW/GD/04-infected MDCK cells. fected MDCK cells showed no reaction to HA proteins of SW/GD/04 infected cells. mAbs detected by mAbs 8C4, 8C6, 9D6, 8A4, and 8B1. mAb 8C6-treated mice showed no obvious clinical symptoms after challenge. challenge Viruses Weight-Loss (%) at 14 dpi Virus Titer (log10 EID50/mL) at 3 dpi 8C6-treated Untreated Lung Nasal Spleen/Kidney 8C6-treated Non-mAb-treated SW/GD//04 \u2013 12.3 0.5 0.5 0.5 4.88 3.29 0.5 SW/HRB/09 1.50 15.7 1.65 1.36 0.5 5.12 4.39 0.5 pre-treated mice showed detectable virus replication in the lungs and one mouse displayed detectable virus replication in the nasal turbinates with mean titers of 1.65 and 1.36 log10 EID50. the virus was detectable in all non-mAb-treated mice with titers of 5.12 and 4.39 log10 EID50. five mAbs against HA were selected for subcloning at least three times. positive hybridomas were used to produce mAbs in mice. concentrations of immunoglobulin ranged from 8.5 to 265.8 g/mL. on of Native HA Protein by Immunohistochemistry Assay SW/GD/04-infected MDCK cells were used to assess whether the obtained mAbs recognize the native-form HA protein by immunohistochemistry (IH) assays. five mAbs showed strong specific reactions to SW/GD/04-infected MDCK cells. no immuno-reactivity was observed in normal MDCK cells (as the negative control) GD/04-infected MDCK cells run in SDS-PAGE detected by mAbs 8C4, 8C6, 9D6, 8A4, and 8B1 respectively. the protective efficacy of the mAb 8C6 was evaluated in mice with two different H1N1 strains (the HA gene of SW/GD/04 showed 90% identities to that of SW/HRB/09) 3 dpi 8C6-treated Untreated Lung Nasal Spleen/Kidney Lung Nasal Spleen/Kidney 8C6-treated Non-mAb-treated SW/GD//04 \u2013 12.3 0.5 0.5 0.5 4.88 3.29 0.5 SW/HRB/09 1.50 15.7 1.65 1.36 0.5 5.12 4.39 0.5 0.5 Indicate that no virus was detected from the undiluted sample. each titer was calculated the virus was detected in all non-mAb-treated mice with titers of 5.12 and 4.39 log10 EID50. no virus was detected in the spleen/kidney of mAb 8C6 pre-treated or non-mAb-treated mice after challenge with SW/GD/04 or SW/HRB/09. mAb 8C6 has the highest HI and NT titers. we examined the protective efficacy in mice by challenging homologous and heterologous strains of H1N1 SIV (SW/GD/04 and SW/HRB/09) mAb 8C6 could provide a complete protection against the homologous and heterologous virus. further studies should be conducted to understand the antigenic properties of the H1N1 virus."}
