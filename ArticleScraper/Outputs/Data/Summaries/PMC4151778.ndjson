{"summary": "results We expressed and purified the S1 domains of four viruses (HKU4, HKU5, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV) and DPP4 ectodomain from two species (human and bat) using procedures described previously (14, 22) the two bat species from which HKU4 and HKU5 were isolated belong to the same family. hDPP4 was more efficient than bDPP4 at pulling down the MERS-CoV S1 domain from solution. neither hDPP4 nor bDPP4 pulled down the HKU4 S1 domain efficiently. this indicates that the HKU4 S1 domain and MERS-CoV-spike-packaged pseudoviruses compete for the same DPP4 receptor on HEK293T cell surface. hDPP4 or bDPP4 was incubated with each of the Fc-tagged coronavirus S1 domains. hDPP4 or bDPP4 was precipitated with nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid beads. hek293T cells expressing hDPP4 or bDPP4 were infected. pseudotyped with HKU4 spike failed to mediate pseudovirus entry into HEK293T cells exogenously expressing either hDPP4 or bDPP4 on their surface. however, when treated with trypsin, HKU4-spike-packaged pseudoviruses entered both hDPP4- and bDPP4-expressing HEK293T cells efficiently. pseudovirus entry efficiency was characterized as luciferase activity accompanying the entry. further confirmation that DPP4 is the receptor for HKU4 spike came from an examination of whether anti-hDPP4 polyclonal antibodies could competitively block interactions between HKU4 and hDPP4. mERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, can be partially processed in virus-producing cells by human endogenous proteases. the processing may be achieved potentially by human proprotein convertases. mERS-CoV- and HKU4-spike-mediated pseudovirus entry. MERS-CoV-spike-mediated entry was significantly inhibited by both NH4Cl and E-64d. these inhibitors showed little effect on HKU4-spike-mediated entry. mERS-CoV spike, but not HKU4 spike, can be processed by human cellular proteases from three different stages of virus infection. huh-7 cells were preincubated with endosomal acidification inhibitor NH4Cl or endosomal protease inhibitor E-64d at the indicated concentrations. the cells were infected by retroviruses that had been pretreated or not with 100 g/mL trypsin. the pseudovirus entry efficiency was characterized as luciferase activity accompanying the entry. es pseudotyped with HKU4 spike (A), MERS-CoV spike (B) or no spike (mock) (C) were incubated with gradient concentrations of trypsin and used to enter Tb1-Lu bat cells. the pseudovirus entry efficiency was characterized as luciferase activity accompanying the entry. MERS-CoV spike binds hDPP4 with significantly higher affinity than it binds bDPP4. HKU4 spike slightly prefers bDPP4 over hDPP4 as its receptor is consistent with a recent finding. hDPP4 spike has evolved to use hDPP4 efficiently. te efficient pseudovirus entry into bat cells suggests that cellular proteases can process both MERS-CoV and HKU4 spikes. these findings provide critical insight into the current MERS-CoV infections and raises concerns over potential future bat coronavirus infections in humans. K293T (human embryonic kidney), MRC-5 (human lung) and Tb1-Lu (Triatoma brasiliensis bat lung) cells were obtained from ATCC. kindly provided by Charles M. Rice at Rockefeller University and Chien-Te K. Tseng. hDPP4 ectodomain (residues 39\u2013766; GenBank accession no. NP_001926.2) and bDPP4 ectodomain (residues 36\u2013760; GenBank accession no. KC249974) were expressed and purified using the same procedure as for His6-tagged coronavirus S1 domains. the DPP4 and coronavirus S1 domains were separated by SDS/PAGE and detected by anti-His6 and anti-human IgG4 Fc antibodies. the membranes were dried completely and blocked with 5% skim milk at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. HEK293T cells transiently expressing hDPP4 or bDPP4 were preincubated with gradient concentrations of each of the purified coronavirus S1 domains for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. after incubation for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C, medium was changed and cells were incubated for an additional 60 h. HEK293T cells expressing hDPP4, bDPP4, or no DPP4 were preincubated with 0, 2 g/mL, or 20 g/mL goat anti-hDPP4 polyclonal antibodies (R&D Systems) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h and then infected by equal amounts of MERS-CoV-spike-pseudotyped retroviruses with no trypsin treatment or HKU4 Huh-7 cells were preincubated with 8 or 40 mM NH4Cl (Sigma-Aldrich) or 4 or 20 M E-64d (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. they were then infected by HKU4- or MERS-CoV-spike-pseudotyped retroviruses. coronavirus S1 domains containing an N-terminal honey bee melittin signal peptide and a C-terminal His6 tag were expressed and purified as previously described. hDPP4 ectodomain (residues 39\u2013766; GenBank accession no. NP_001926.2) and bDPP4 ectodomain (residues 36\u2013760; GenBank accession no. KC2499 each of the Fc-tagged coronavirus S1 domains at 3 nM final concentrations was mixed with 100 nM His6-tagged hDPP4 or bDPP4 in 1/2 AreaPlate. the mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 1 h and protected from light. HEK293T cells transiently expressing hDPP4 or bDPP4 were preincubated with gradient concentrations of each of the purified coronavirus S1 domains for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. the membrane was then washed five times with phosphate-buffered saline with Tween-20 (PBST) and washed five times with PBST. retroviruses pseudotyped with MERS-CoV spike, HKU4 spike, or no spike (mock) were incubated with gradient concentrations of trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) for 10 min at 25 \u00b0C. trypsin-treated pseudoviruses were then used to spin-infect HKE293T cells. retroviruses pseudotyped with MERS-CoV spike, HKU4 spike, or no spike (mock) were incubated with gradient concentrations of TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma-Aldrich) for 10 min at 25 \u00b0C, and 100 g/mL soybean trypsin inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich) was then added to stop proteolysis reactions. retroviruses pseudotyped with no spike (mock) were used as control."}
