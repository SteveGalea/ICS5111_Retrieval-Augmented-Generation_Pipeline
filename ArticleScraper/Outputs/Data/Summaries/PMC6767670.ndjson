{"summary": "studies on exoskeletons have been carried out to overcome these problems. examples by Lokomat [1], Rewalk [2], and Ekso [3] are used to rehabilitate subjects affected by spine cord injury. exoskeletons such as the hybrid assistive limb (HAL) [4] provide muscle strength support for people with age-related weakness. the proposed exoskeleton has the structure which measures the change of the center of rotation. the exoskeleton can be equipped to actual wearer because the sensor is attached inside the exoskeleton. the exoskeleton is designed using various types of actuators. some studies have used an encoder or an inertia measurement unit (IMU). the encoder is used to measure the angle of the joint and the length between the knee center of rotation and the ankle (LBKA) NN is used for intention detection. the exoskeleton is designed in a modular form to assist the knee. the exoskeleton is designed with three sections, a torque output section, a driving section, and a variable ankle section. each component of the exoskeleton is described in Section 2.1, Section 2.2, and Section 2.3. the range of motion of the human knee joint is 140\u00b0. the exoskeleton does not limit the wearer\u2019s range of motion. the driving section applies the torque generated by the motor to the wearer\u2019s knee. weight reduction is important because the driving section is directly attached to the wearer\u2019s leg. an acrylonitrile butadiene styrene copolymer resin is used as the main material. the tibia, and lower part of the knee joint is the femur. extension and flexion account for most of the movement of the knee joint. the knee joint is rotated by moving the elliptical femur bone on the plane of the tibia bone. figure 6 shows how the self-alignment structure of the exoskeleton works. to prevent sagging of straps, a sag prevention part is attached to a flexible strap in order to make the strap stiff. exoskeleton has a length margin of l v _ s. when straightened, the exoskeleton has a length margin of l v _ s. when the wearer bends the knee, length of lower frame decreases by l t c. the exoskeleton is designed with three sections, a torque output section, a driving section, and a variable ankle section. the angle of the knee,, is measured using the encoder of the motor. the exoskeleton has a flexion/extension DoF, whose angle is indicated by. the motors have high gear ratios, so they do not have back-drivability. to measure this load, springs are inserted into the Bowden cables. the displacement of the spring is proportional to the applied force. the driving section is composed of an upper frame and a lower frame. the lower frame is bound to the ankle using a strap. the lower frame is connected to the upper frame through a bearing. the lower frame is rotated along the axis determined by the upper frame. to measure the change of the LBKA, a sliding variable resister is installed in the lower frame pipe. the ankle part rotates freely along the lower frame pipe, but the sliding variable resister can only move prismatically. to prevent this, the prismatic part is connected to the sliding variable resister to move prismatically along the lower frame pipe. the length of lower frame when the wearer bends the knee l j _ b is obtained as follows: l j _ b = l t a + l t c _ b (2) l t c _ b = l t c _ s l t c (3) where l t c _ b. is the length between the tibia plane and the center of rotation when the knee is bent friction compensation and NN for intention detection are described in section 3.1. controller for friction compensation is explained in terms of the mechanism and structure of the controller in Section 3.1. the motor has high gear friction and the Bowden cables have internal friction. the wearer and the exoskeleton are calculated as follows: = f d, f = k e (5) In this equation, k and d are the spring constant and the distance from the center of the knee to the point where the tension is applied, respectively, and e is the displacement of the spring on the motor. the friction compensation is performed through motor control to make the displacement of the spring zero. neural network is trained for four states of motion: stair ascending, stair descending, walking, and exceptions. the first trained state is stair ascending. the second trained state is stair descending. in all three states, the weight of the wearer acts on the knee, which requires a lot of torque on the knee. the result from the trained neural network is the probability of each state. this output does not indicate a definite state, so it cannot be used in practical uses such as torque generation. in the proposed exoskeleton, the lower frame can rotate without the motor moving because the spring is compressed and tensioned. the force changes spring length, and this change can be used to measure the force. this force can be regarded as a load which the wearer feels because of the friction of the motor. neural network is used for intention detection. it is easy to use and shows good performance in pattern recognition. NN is used because NN is easy to apply to intention detection. the intention is detected by training the pattern when the knee is completely extended in the walking motion. in all three states, the weight of the wearer acts on the knee, which requires a lot of torque on the knee. the friction compensation test was performed by repeatedly moving the knee while wearing the exoskeleton. a torque graph calculated using the measured sensor data shows that the load felt by the wearer is less than 0.33 Nm. the LBKA sensor measures the change of LBKA caused by the movement of the internal joint, so there is no delay. table 1 shows how much faster the change of LBKA is compared with the motor encoder value by averaging the experimental data. the performance graph of the trained neural network shows that the error of the trainset decreases after the 43rd epoch. this means that overfitting occurs after the 43rd epoch. training was correctly performed by selecting 43 epochs that have the best performance in both the test set and training set. experiment to see if the intention detection works properly when the experiment is performed at different periods. Figure 18. Mixed stair descending experiment with fast period. Figure 19. Similar pattern input experiment. a torque graph calculated using the measured sensor data shows that the load felt by the wearer is less than 0.33 Nm. this value is small enough that a person cannot feel the load. this value is small enough that a person cannot feel the load. the friction compensation works well, and the wearer can move without friction. the error is added to the measured value because of the weight of the exoskeleton. but it does not affect the overall tendency to detect intention. each of the three states used 40 training datasets and 200 training datasets. training set, validation set, and test set were evaluated. the 43rd epoch neural network was used. Figure 14 shows the ROC curve used for measuring the performance of the neural network. experiment to see if the intention detection works properly when the experiment is performed at different periods. we entered sensor data that could be confused with other states by wearer bending the legs repeatedly. the direction of the body between the two states is reversed. LBKA value is measured by self-alignment structure. it is measured without delay unlike the encoder of a motor. intention detection works well in all cases when different motions are mixed."}
