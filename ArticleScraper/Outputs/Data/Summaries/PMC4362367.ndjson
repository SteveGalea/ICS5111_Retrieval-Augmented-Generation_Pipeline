{"summary": "major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are heterodimeric glycoproteins composed of a polymorphic heavy chain and an invariant 2-microglobulin (2m) they bind naturally processed antigenic peptides, and present them to CD8+ CTLs for immune surveillance. the discovery of a peptide-binding groove in the MHC class I molecule1 was a major breakthrough in immunology. the mutant is located in the 1 helix in the peptide-binding groove. it could be useful for the efficient induction of HLA-A*02:01-restricted, peptide-specific CTLs. however, there was no appropriate method of verifying this hypothesis at that time. HHD mice have been used as a versatile preclinical animal model for the study of HLA-A*02:01-restricted CTL responses in HHD mice. a simple point mutation in the MHC class I heavy chain of the SCT molecule induces enhancement of both in vivo CTL priming and antitumor protection. the expression level of the H74L mutant molecules on RMA-H74L cells was almost equivalent to that of the HHD molecules on RMA cells expressing the WT HHD (RMA-HHD) the expression level was almost equivalent to that of the HHD molecules on RMA cells expressing the WT HHD (RMA-H74L) CTL lines were examined for killing activities against RMA, RMA-HHD and RMA-H74L in the presence of a peptide. data are shown as the mean SD of triplicate wells. the efficiency of peptide loading on the HHD molecule was significantly increased by the H74L mutation. a series of amino acid substitutions at position 74 of the HHD molecule were also tested for their effects on the peptide presentation in the FMP58-66-specific CTL response. the molecule comprises an epitope, human 2m and HHD with the H74L mutation (SCT-H74L) the molecule comprises an epitope, human 2m and HHD with the H74L mutation (SCT-H74L) FITC-labeled goat antimouse IgG antibody generated a recombinant adenovirus expressing either SCT-HHD (Ad-SCT-HHD) or SCT-H74L (Ad-SCT-H74L) in vivo priming. FMP-specific CTLs were induced in all mice immunized with 1.6 108 TCID50 of either Ad-FMP, Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-SCT-H74L. at an inoculation dose of 1.6 107 TCID50, percentages of CTL-positive mice were diminished to 60 and 80% in mice vaccinated with Ad-FMP and Ad-SCT-HHD respectively. mice infected with either Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-SCT-H74L gave the highest specific lysis of FMP58-66-pulsed splenocytes, while Ad-FMP-injected mice revealed slightly lower killing activity. in vivo detection of enhanced FMP-specific cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) killing activities in Ad-SCT-H74L-immunized mice. after 1 week following immunization, in vivo CTL assays were performed. infection with either Ad-FMP or Ad-SCT-HHD induced high percentages of IFN--producing CD8+ T cells. at a 10-fold lower dose, however, any of the mice that had been injected with either Ad-FMP or Ad-SCT-HHD did not show significant percentages of IFN--producing CD8+ T cells. the HHD molecule significantly improves the efficacy of SCTs for priming peptide-specific CTLs in vivo. we next performed tumor challenge experiments with either Ad-WT, Ad-FMP, Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-SCT-H74L. all Ad-WT-infected mice died by day 29, whereas many of Ad-SCT-H74L-immunized mice survived for over 60 days after tumor inoculation. vaccination with 1.6 106 TCID50 of either Ad-FMP or Ad-SCT-HHD did not induce sufficient protection against i.v. challenge. spleen cells were prepared and stained with PE-conjugated anti-H-2Db mAb. after 12\u201314 hours, spleen cells were prepared and stained with spleen cells. mice were immunized with 1.6 105 TCID50 of Ad-SCT-H74L. at this inoculation dose, neither Ad-SCT-HHD nor Ad-FMP induced detectable FMP-specific CTL responses in mice. 51Cr-release assays were then performed at various effector to target cell ratios. the mutant HLA-A*02:01 molecule with the H74L mutation possessed the unique ability to enhance the presentation of exogenously loaded peptides to peptide-specific CTLs. to confirm these results, we firstly constructed a mutant HHD gene that could generate this mutation in the HHD molecule (HHD-H74L) virus (HTLV)-tax (HTLV-tax11-19) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-pol (HIV-pol476-484) showed that this phenomenon was not peptide-specific as described in previous studies. peptide-binding studies were conducted using the transporter associated antigen processing-2 (TAP-2) deficient cell line, RMA-S19 expressing HHD (RMA-S-HHD) or HHD-H74L (RMA-S-H74L) in the HHD system is likely to be equal to that of the mutant HLA-A*02:01 with the H74L mutation.6,9,20 The SCT polypeptide comprises three MHC class I components including an antigenic peptide, 2m and the MHC class I heavy chain attached sequentially with flexible linkers. molecule comprises an epitope, human 2m and HHD with the H74L mutation. molecule comprises an epitope, human 2m; 1, 2, 3: 1, 2, 3 domains. expression of SCT-H74L on surface of RMA-S cells. HHD mice were immunized once with either Ad-SCT-HHD, Ad-SCT-H74L, Ad-FMP or WT adenovirus (Ad-WT) at various doses ranging from 1.6 108 to 1.6 104 TCID50/mouse. after 2 weeks following immunization, spleen cells were prepared, stimulated in vitro with FMP58\u201366, and then examined for their FMP58\u201366- Ad-WT at any doses tested did not elicit FMP-specific CTLs in mice. spleen cells were stimulated once with FMP58-66. spleen cells were examined for their FMP-specific killing activities. with either Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-SCT-H74L gave the highest specific lysis of FMP58-66-pulsed splenocytes, while Ad-FMP-injected mice revealed the slightly lower killing activity. in contrast, any mice infected with the low doses of either Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-FMP did not generate FMP-specific CTL responses. splenic lymphocytes of the immunized mice were prepared and cultured with FMP58-66. cells were then stained for their surface expression of CD8 and peptide-induced intracellular expression of IFN-. infection with either Ad-FMP or Ad-SCT-HHD induced high percentages of IFN--producing CD8+ T cells in several mice tested as well. splenic lymphocytes were prepared and stimulated with (+) or without () FMP58\u201366 for 5 hours. cells were then stained for their surface expression of CD8 and their intracellular expression of IFN-. each symbol represents an individual mouse. vaccination with Ad-SCT-H74L gave significantly higher clearance of RMA-HHD-FMP tumor cells expressing endogenous FMP58-66 in mice. after immunization with 1.6 106 TCID50, mice were challenged intravenously (i.v.) with 5 106 cells/mouse of RMA-HHD-FMP cells. immunization with Ad-SCT-H74L induces strong antitumor protection in HHD mice. mice were vaccinated with Ad-WT, Ad-FMP, Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-SCT-H74L at various doses. mice (ten per group) were challenged i.v. with 5 106 RMA-HHD-FMP cells. after 1 week, mice were challenged subcutaneously with 5 104 RMA-HHD-FMP cells/mouse. spleen cells were prepared, stimulated in vitro twice with peptide-pulsed syngeneic spleen cells. 51Cr-release assays were then carried out at various E:T ratios. labels 1, 2, 3 indicate data from three different representative mice. a number of mutational analyses for MHC class I molecules have been performed by multiple groups. these findings resulted from the data of CTL responses abolished or impaired by the introduction of a single amino acid substitution at a particular position into the MHC class I heavy chain of the SCT. position 74 is an aspartic acid or a tyrosine (Y) two different groups found that CTL recognition presented by H74D was slightly impaired. the same group showed that H74Y did not display an increase in CTL recognition. the H74L mutant stimulated FMP-specific CTLs in HHD mice at lower viral doses than Ad-SCT-HHD or native HHD molecules. these data strongly suggest that SCT-H74L molecules are more stable at the cell surface than SCT-HHD or native HHD molecules. a peptide with the high binding affinity may be little affected by this disruption. a mutation from tyrosine to alanine at position 84 of a heavy chain (Y84) was introduced into the SCT comprises H-2Kb heavy chain, 2m, and an ovalbumin peptide (SCT-Y84A) it was speculated that Y84A would partially open the binding groove to allow a better fit of the C-terminal linker-attached peptide. ELISPOT analysis showed the predominance of SCT-Q115E over its WT counterpart at in vivo priming peptide-specific CTLs in mice. however, the introduction of the Y84A mutation, the disulfide trap and/or the Q115E mutation into SCT-H74L might generate a synergistic effect on the in vivo priming of peptide-specific CTLs. the capacity of SCT-H74L to bind and present low affinity epitopes remains to be investigated. however, preliminary data showing that the mutation enhanced binding and CTL recognition of tumor peptides including tumor epitopes. mice were housed in appropriate animal care facilities at Saitama Medical University. peptides HLA-A*02:01-restricted epitopes used were as follows: FMP58\u201366 (sequence: GILGFVFTL),31 HPV-E629\u201338 (sequence: TIHDIILECV),32 HTLV-tax11\u201319 (sequence: LLFGYPVYV),33 and HIV-pol476 spleen cells of immunized mice were prepared, pulsed with 10 mol/l of an appropriate peptide for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C, and irradiated at 20 grays. after 2 weeks, spleen cells of immunized mice were prepared, and stimulated twice or three times with peptide-pulsed, irradiated syngeneic spleen cells. inverse PCR-based site-directed mutagenesis35 was performed using KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) two back-to-back primers oriented in the reverse direction to amplify the entire plasmid. one of the primers contained a nucleotide change that caused a single amino acid substitution at position 74. a gene encoding the whole FMP of influenza A virus was synthesized by Operon Biotechnologies. this gene consists of the leader sequence of human 2m followed immediately by the FMP58\u201366 sequence and then a linker of 15 residues ((G4S)3). this first linker is followed by the human mature 2m sequence, the second linker of 15 residues ((G4S)3), and then the HHD sequence. RMA-S cells were also electroporated with pcDNA3.1-H74L, pcDNA3.1-SCT-HHD, or pcDNA3.1-SCT-H74L. after selection with G418 (Nakarai Tesque) at a final concentration of 1.2 mg/ml, transfectants were analyzed for their surface HHD expression by flow cytometry. the expression of mutant HHD molecules on each transfectant was almost equivalent to that of R pShuttle-CMV-SCT-H74L was inserted into the XhoI-HindIII sites of pShuttle-CMV vector (pShuttle-CMV-SCT-HHD) the construct was confirmed by DNA sequencing (Operon Biotechnologies) the shuttle vector, pShuttle-CMV-SCT-HHD or pShuttle-CMV-SCT-H74L, was linearized with PmeI mice were injected intraperitoneally (i.p.) once with either 1.6 104, 1.6 105, 1.6 106, 1.6 107 or 1.6 108 TCID50 of adenovirus in 0.5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline. 51Cr-release assay 51Cr-release assays were carried out as described before. % specific lysis = [(cpmsample cpmspontaneous)/(cpmmaximum cpmspontaneous)] 100. maximum release represents radioactivity released by target cells lysed with 5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) naive spleen cells were prepared and split into two populations. one population was pulsed with 10 mol/l of FMP58\u201366 and labeled with 2.5 mol/l of CFSE. the other population was just labeled with 0.25 mol/l of CFSE. % specific lysis = [1 (number of CFSElow cells in normal mice)/(number of CFSEhigh cells in normal mice)/(number of CFSEhigh cells in immunized mice). a total of 1 107 cells was injected i.v. into each mouse that had been immunized with adenovirus 1 week previously. mice were inoculated subcutaneously with 5 104 TCID50 of either Ad-WT, Ad-FMP, Ad-SCT-HHD or Ad-SCT-H74L. tumor volume was measured every 2\u20133 days using a caliper in the two perpendicular diameters. cell lines Mouse lymphoma cell lines, RMA (H-2b) and TAP-2-deficient RMA-S (H-2b),19 were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) with 10% FCS (Sigma-Aldrich) (R-10) peptide-pulsed cells were then adopted i.v. into mice (2 107 cells/mouse) spleen cells of immunized mice were prepared and stimulated twice or three times with peptide-pulsed, irradiated syngeneic spleen cells. after the second stimulation, human recombinant IL-2 (Cetus, Barkley, CA) was added to the culture media at a final concentration of 100 U/ml. peptide-specific killing activities of CTL lines were checked prior to experiments. single amino acid substitution at position 74 in the 1 domain of HHD. plasmid DNA was digested by DpnI that recognizes the Gm6ATC sites of plasmid DNA purified from ordinary host E. coli. the indigested PCR product containing a nucleotide substitution was then recircularized by T4 polynucleotide kinase and ligase. the SCT gene was subcloned into the XhoI and HindIII sites of the expression vector, pcDNA3.1 () (Invitrogen). a nucleotide substitution that causes the H74L mutation in the 1 domain of HHD was then created in pcDNA3.1-SCT-HHD (pcDNA3.1-SCT-H74L) using the KOD-Plus mutagenesis kit (Toyobo) transfectants expressing positive peaks were cloned by limiting dilution. expression of mutant HHD molecules on each transfectant was almost equivalent to that of RMA-HHD or RMA-S-HHD cells. cells were cloned and confirmed for their expression of GFP-fused FMP by flow cytometry. uttle-CMV-SCT-HHD or pShuttle-CMV-SCT-H74L was linearized with PmeI. plasmids were digested with PacI and transfected into Ad-293 cells. after 10\u201314 days following transfection, adenoviruses were released from the cells by three cycles of rapid freezing and thawing. 51Cr-release assays were carried out as described before. spleen cells of immunized mice were stimulated once with gamma-irradiated, syngeneic spleen cells. at the second stimulation, human recombinant IL-2 (Cetus) was added to the culture media at a final concentration of 100 U/ml. responses against various RMA-HHD mutant cells were standardized as the percent relative lysis by the following formula: % relative binding = [(% specific lysis against RMA-HHD mutants % specific lysis against RMA)/(% specific lysis against RMA-HHD % specific lysis against RMA)] 100. cells were incubated with 10 mol/l of FMP58\u201366 for 5 hours at 37 \u00b0C. after blocking Fc receptors, cells were stained with FITC-conjugated antimouse CD8 smonoclonal antibody (mAb) followed by the staining of intracellular IFN- with PE-conjugated anti-IFN- mAb. a total of 1 107 cells were injected i.v. into each mouse that had been immunized with adenovirus 1 week earlier. after 12\u201314 hours, spleen cells were prepared, treated with anti-Fc receptor mAb (BioLegend), and stained with PE-conjugated anti-H-2Db mAb (BioLegend) tumor volume = (D d2)/2, where d is the smaller of the two diameters. Mice were killed when the tumor volume grew up to 800 mm3."}
