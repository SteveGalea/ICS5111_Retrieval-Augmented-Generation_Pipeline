{"summary": "cells were grown in T25 culture flasks and maintained in RPMI-1640 medium (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS) (Eurobio, Les Ulis, France), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco, Auckland, New Zealand), 1.5 g/L sodium bicarbonate, 10 mM HEPES and 1 mM pyruvate (all from Gibco) infected astrocyte cultures were kept for three weeks before obtaining trypomastigotes for astrocyte infection assays. confluent cells were infected with 5 x 106 trypomastigotes for 48 h. at least 1 x 104 PI-negative cells (live cells) were acquired in each experimental condition and gated based on cell size and granularity. cells with the same size and granularity as controls were considered uninfected cells. the rabbit polyclonal antibody 30532 (0.8 mg/mL) was incubated with 10 L of a 1:100 dilution of each primary antibodies for 20 min at RT. the cells for the intracellular epitope were fixed with 4% formaldehyde and permeated with 0.1% Tween 20. arithmetic mean, standard deviation and percentages were calculated. SPSS v.18 was used to perform the calculations (IBM, Somers, NY, USA) astrocytes infection with Trypanosoma cruzi. a: mean and standard deviation (SD) of the T. cruzi infected cell percentages. number of amastigotes increased with time as well (n = 5) cells from uninfected wells showed similar numbers of astrocytes at each day p.i. mortality was slightly higher in infected cells compared with the cells from uninfected wells. cells from the parasite-infected wells showed a different HLA class I pattern. the larger cells had a higher HLA class I MFI at day 6 p.i. at day 2 p.i., CCL2 was lower in supernatants of the supernatants from infected wells than control wells (1880.12 pg/mL 295.2) this trend was also seen at day 4 p.i., in which the CCL2 concentration in the infected wells was 1972.24 pg/mL 367.29 compared with 5560.67 pg/mL 927.7 in control wells. 77.84% 10.82% of cells pre-incubated with the cell-surface LDLr antibody were infected with T. cruzi at day 3 p.i. the number of amastigotes per infected cell was not determined. vero and BESM (bovine muscle) cells are less susceptible to T. cruzi infection. compared with reports on human cell lines, cell lines differ in susceptibility to T. cruzi. astrocytes can act as antigen-presenting cells and activate CD4+ helper T cells. this mechanism could explain the devastating progress of T. cruzi CNS infection in AIDS patients. mice infected with T. cruzi in the CNS display tissue infiltration at day 42 p.i. and by some neutrophils at day 30. astrocytes showed CXCL8 upregulation, an important factor for neutrophil chemotaxis. incubation with an LDLr antibody recognised the cell-surface epitope did not decrease the percentage of infected cells. astrocytes are highly susceptible to T. cruzi infection."}
