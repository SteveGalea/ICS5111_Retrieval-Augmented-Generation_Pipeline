{"summary": "a retrospective study was performed at the ED of a regional teaching hospital with 226 acute-care beds in Taiwan (22\u00b0N 120\u00b0E) a four-year (2005\u20132008) data set was used to construct the forecasting model. the ED visits were classified as trauma, nontrauma, or pediatric. the ED visits were classified as trauma, nontrauma, or pediatric. nontrauma patients classified as pediatric and nonpediatric nontrauma patients. average monthly temperature ranges from 18.6 to 28.7 degrees Celsius. average monthly humidity ranges from 60% to 81%. ARIMA time series model is designed to examine sequentially lagged relationships for relationships that may not be apparent in data collected periodically. the model was subjected to box-Cox transformation [10]. a retrospective study was performed at the ED of a regional teaching hospital with 226 acute-care beds in Taiwan (22\u00b0N 120\u00b0E) a four-year (2005\u20132008) data set was used to construct the forecasting model. the ED visits were classified as trauma, nontrauma, or pediatric. the total number of investor accounts reached 15,143,707 in 2009. the total number of investor accounts reached 15,143,707 in September, 2009. this represents 82.42% of the Taiwan adult population (18,374,613). the transformed series was then differentiated at the nonseasonal level and mean corrected to induce stationarity. the final model obtained after several iterations of the identification, estimation, and checking processes met the conventional criteria for model adequacy. minimum temperature ranged from 8.90\u00b0C to 25.22\u00b0C. monthly relative humidity was 62.96%\u201391.18%. monthly rainfall was 18.73 mm to 568.93 mm with maximum rainfalls observed in June and September. .37, 0.53)** 1 month 0.31 (0.23,0.38)** 1 month Mean minimum temperature 0.45 (0.51, 0.39)** 1 month 0.41 (0.31, 0.52)** 1 month 0.33 (0.45, 0.22)* 1 month 0.38 (0.45, 0.32)** 1 month Relative humidity 0.48 (0.40, 0.56)** 0 month 0.52 (0.70, 0.35)* 1 month 0.23 (0.20, 0.57)* 1 month Accumul parameters from autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model (1, 0, 0) for ED revenue (January, 2005\u2013December, 2008).
