{"summary": "the current literature focuses on identifying potential risk factors for introduction and transmission of enteric disease. but does not examine why these risk factors happen, how the risk is understood and managed by the staff of regulated CCCs, or what challenges they experience responding to enteric illness. over 98% of child care centre staff were female and 45% were under the age of 30. the national average hourly rate was $11.62 for a teacher and $9.59 for an assistant. only 74% of staff reported paid sick days, which averaged 7.6 days/year. staff of regulated centres in southern Ontario were identified as an important group to consult with regarding the development of consistent guidance. qualitative research approaches were selected as the most suitable tool to gather this information. focus groups are a mechanism for collecting data. participants provided written, informed consent Study Participants. a purposive sampling approach was used to recruit participants from regulated CCCs in southern Ontario. centres were selected by the researchers and contacted by phone. focus groups were conducted in a CCC or public location and lasted between 45 and 60 minutes. the principal investigator moderated all groups and a co-facilitator assisted by taking detailed notes. notes pertained to group participation, how questions were responded to, interesting features of the discussion, and considerations for future groups. participants from regulated CCCs in southern Ontario were recruited by the researchers and contacted by phone. study information and requirements were sent to each centre for their further consideration. participants were defined as those who provided daytime care for an entire day to a group of children. focus groups were conducted in a CCC or public location and lasted between 45 and 60 minutes. the principal investigator moderated all groups and a co-facilitator assisted by taking detailed notes. all groups were audio-taped using a digital recorder and transcribed verbatim. five major themes emerged from the data. the following is a description of the themes and text based examples. staff ensured health and safety through observation and the creation of an informal surveillance system. staff monitored the health and safety of the children by collecting information on various forms. there was no standardardization of forms, although in some jurisdictions standard forms may have been recommended by public health officials. staff relied on the supervisor to identify centre-wide health concerns and inform all staff. staff: it's just a lot cleaner in the sense that you Virox cleaners more often and more often and more often and more often and more often. staff spoke easily and frequently about their type of cleaning they did during an outbreak. staff described two reasons for this uncertainty: 1) Diarrhea could be child specific. the definition of diarrhea could vary between staff members and often was considered a \"judgment call\" staff discussed their need for standard definitions for both diarrhea and outbreak. staff had different forms of education and varying experiences. experienced staff indicated their personal judgments of diarrhea. new or inexperienced staff required training by more experienced staff to assist with decision-making. staff were pressed for time to find ways to incorporate this demand into an already busy schedule and maintain a high level of care. during outbreaks we are disinfecting every surface, every toy, like every half day to every day. staff: it's a lot, on top of all the stuff with parents and the kids. staff said it was difficult for them to take time off from work when they were sick. if a substitute staff member worked in a centre during an outbreak they were not allowed to work concurrently. if a substitute staff member worked in a centre during an outbreak, they may choose to work. ratios between staff and children are regulated and must be maintained in a centre at all times. when staff became ill, or when an ill child needed to be segregated from the larger group, the maintenance of ratios between staff and children could be compromised. staff balanced variables such as how ill the child was, how long they had already been in the centre, and the number of available staff. staff recognized their inability to monitor the child and ensure proper hygiene. they relied on the parent's honesty regarding their child's health status. staff felt conflicted between balancing the needs of the parents and what they deemed best for the centre. staff ensured health and safety through observation and the creation of an informal surveillance system for any illness among the children. staff reported an intimate knowledge of the behaviour and health status of each child they cared for, including indicators of enteric illness such as bowel movements. staff monitored the health and safety of the children by collecting information on various forms. there was no standardardization of forms, although in some jurisdictions standard forms may have been recommended by public health officials. staff relied on the supervisor or director of the entire centre to identify centre-wide health concerns and inform all staff. staff: it's just a lot cleaner in the sense that you Virox cleaners more often and more often and more often and more often and more often. staff spoke easily and frequently about their type of cleaning they did during an outbreak, how often they did it, and how it became a habit they integrated into their day. staff described two reasons for this uncertainty: 1) Diarrhea could be child specific. the definition of diarrhea could vary between staff members and often was considered a \"judgment call\" staff said there were a number of ways in which they determined when an outbreak was occurring. staff had different forms of education and varying experiences. experienced staff indicated their personal judgments of diarrhea. new or inexperienced staff required training by more experienced staff to assist with decision-making. staff were pressed for time to find ways to

and what they deemed best for the centre. money Most centres identified that on a regular basis they used bleach and water to clean and disinfect. use of these products was considered important for making the environment safe for the children. staff described that they were always pressed for time, and in certain circumstances, additional responsibilities could require changes to routines in child care that may not be feasible. staff used forms related to the group they cared for (e.g. attendance) and each individual child. forms related to enteric illness were only some of the records staff kept. staff said it was difficult for them to take time off from work when they were sick. staff balanced variables such as how ill the child was, how long they had already been in the centre, and the number of available staff. sometimes we just don't have the staff or ability to segregate a child. staff: sometimes we just don't have the staff or ability to segregate a child. staff recognized their inability to monitor the child and ensure proper hygiene. they relied on the parent's honesty regarding their child's health status. staff felt conflicted between balancing the needs of the parents and what they deemed best for the centre. staff described difficulty in defining both \"diarrhea\" and \"outbreak\" staff adapted their actions to ensure appropriate care, even if it meant modifying recommendations provided by public health officials. a study of this nature has not been done. a purposive sampling approach ensured that participating centres represented a range of care settings available in southern Ontario. the major themes, experiences and perspectives that the staff spoke of were the same regardless of what type of centre they worked in. decision-making process is informal and relies on intuition and judgment of the decision-maker. decision-making relies heavily on using judgment and experience to make decisions and modify plans to meet the needs of the situation in a workable and timely manner. a consistent understanding of \"diarrhea\" and \"outbreak\" indicated a need for this guidance. it is important for public health officials and management of CCCs to work together. it remains an important task to continue to clarify procedures and activities with all staff. policy and procedures staff were proud of the impact they had on children's development and education. the intrinsic value placed on child care is significant, but staff often felt that their work was undervalued. staff should not be penalized financially for taking time off when sick. the relationship between staff and parents is important as it relates to monitoring and preventing enteric illness in CCCs. an intervention study could be conducted to test the effectiveness of the recommendations in reducing the amount of illness. an intervention study could be conducted to test the effectiveness of the recommendations in reducing the amount of illness. information collected on the forms is invaluable in illness surveillance for the entire centre. enhancing awareness and communication among staff could ensure rapid implementation of preventative measures such as increased cleaning throughout the centre. staff expressed the desire for tools that would make the process of cleaning easier. relationship between staff, parents and public health is essential to ensuring proper response and management of enteric illness. the relationship between staff and parents is important as it relates to monitoring and preventing enteric illness in CCCs. results from this qualitative assessment will be useful to public health officials responsible for developing tools and resources to further support or better inform current knowledge and practices for preventing and managing enteric disease. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
