{"summary": "croup is an acute, potentially life-threatening illness that can present with sudden onset of stridor and respiratory distress resulting from thick membranous secretions within the trachea. the most frequently isolated bacterial pathogen is Staphylococcus aureus. epiglottitis presents with an abrupt onset of dysphagia, drooling, anxiety and fever, but the barky cough typical of croup is absent. the child prefers to sit in an upright posture to maintain the airway in an optimal \u201csniffing\u201d position. angioedema can occur at any age with the rapid onset of upper airway obstruction and stridor, along with other signs of allergy including urticarial skin rash. underlying causes of airway obstruction can worsen during a viral infection, and stridor can become more prominent, mimicking croup. croup is reliably determined by history and physical examination in most cases. radiographs can be used to support an alternate diagnosis, but a normal-appearing film does not necessarily rule out alternate diagnoses. methods to objectively assess severity of respiratory distress in children have been proposed and examined, but are not practically applicable in acute care setting. the absence of stridor at rest is the key feature that distinguishes mild from moderate respiratory distress, the absence of sustained agitation mainly distinguishes moderate from severe distress. the absence of lethargy or cyanosis on room air mainly distinguishes severe distress from impending respiratory failure. the most practical method of oxygen administration is via plastic tubing held by the parent to within a few centimetres of the child\u2019s nose and mouth. corticosteroids benefit children with symptoms of croup that range from mild to severe. corticosteroid treatment reduced endotracheal intubation by fivefold. corticosteroid treatment reduced length of hospital stay by one-third compared with placebo. two randomized controlled trials compared the 2 most commonly used oral corticosteroids. a single oral dose of dexamethasone was found to be superior to prednisolone in reducing the rate of return to medical care. the other study compared oral dexamethasone with oral prednisolone. sonide with either oral or intramuscular dexamethasone did not find a difference in duration of hospital stay (13 h for budesonide v. 12 h for intramuscular dexamethasone, nonsignificant),35 rate of admission to hospital (35% for budesonide v. 17% for intramuscular dexamethasone, p = 0.18)36 or clinical croup score at 4 hours (p = 0.70) studies of nebulized epinephrine treatment of croup have used both racemic and L-epinephrine. one small trial found that nebulized epinephrine was as effective and safe as racemic epinephrine. at 2 hours, L-epinephrine showed a small but significant reduction in croup score compared with racemic epinephrine. other pharmacotherapies suggest frequent use of several other pharmaceutical agents including salbutamol and antibiotics to treat croup. corticosteroids benefit children with symptoms of croup that range from mild to severe. corticosteroid treatment decreased endotracheal intubation by fivefold. corticosteroid treatment reduced length of hospital stay by one-third compared with placebo. two randomized controlled trials compared the 2 most commonly used oral corticosteroids, dexamethasone and prednisolone. the standard dose of dexamethasone is 0.6 mg/kg, but doses as low as 0.15 mg/kg have been studied in 4 randomized trials. three randomized clinical trials have shown that intramuscular dexamethasone does not provide benefit over oral corticosteroid in either change in clinical croup score at 4 hours (p = 0.18),45 resolution of croup symptoms at 24 hours (2% for intramuscular v. 8% for oral administration, nonsignificant) nebulized administration could be considered in the rare case of a patient with sustained vomiting. 5 prospective cohort studies included a total of 253 children who received epinephrine and dexamethasone. 12 (5%) children returned for care within 48\u201372 hours after discharge. 6 (2%) were subsequently admitted to hospital and none had any other adverse event. epinephrine is now widely used in place of racemic epinephrine. other pharmacotherapies suggest frequent use of salbutamol and antibiotics to treat croup in children. a randomized placebo-controlled trial included 720 children with mild croup seen in an emergency department. corticosteroid treatment reduced return medical visits by half (7% v. 15%, p 0.001), resulted in less stress and loss of sleep by parents. a meta-analysis of 6 studies on children admitted to hospital with croup found higher doses of corticosteroid were associated with a higher proportion of children showing clinical improvement. the route of administration of corticosteroid (oral, nebulized or intramuscular injection) has received extensive study. nebulized administration could be considered in the rare case of a patient with sustained vomiting. no published studies have compared effectiveness of single-dose to multiple-dose corticosteroids. children with longer-lasting symptoms who are admitted to hospital may achieve benefit from further doses. studies of nebulized epinephrine treatment of croup have used both racemic and racemic epinephrine. one small trial found that L-epinephrine was as effective and safe as racemic epinephrine (0.5 mL, 2.25%) the Toward Optimized Practice guideline suggests that children with no stridor or chest wall indrawing at rest may be safely discharged home. children with persistent stridor and chest wall indrawing more than 4 hours after treatment with corticosteroids should be admitted to hospital. croup is the second most common cause of respiratory distress in children. corticosteroids reduce the severity and duration of respiratory distress. croup is the second most common cause of respiratory distress in children."}
