{"summary": "severe CAP was defined as an acute lower respiratory tract infection with fever or hypothermia, cough, or dyspnea acquired outside the hospital. the presence of pneumonia was confirmed by chest radiography. all patients fulfilled the criteria for severe sepsis [19] pleural fluid, empyema, and alveolar edema were registered. the sum of Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) [23], CURB-65 (confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure) score [24] and minor criteria for SCAP [2] were also calculated. length of ICU and hospital stays and ICU, hospital, and 28-day mortalities were analyzed. a microorganism was considered a definite cause of SCAP if cultured from blood. a bacterium was considered as the etiology of SCAP only if it grew from good-quality bronchial aspirates or BAL (cutoff 104 CFU) nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchial aspirates and BAL samples were analyzed by PCR. a multiplex PCR test kit was used to detect adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, bocavirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, and OC43. medians with 25th\u201375th percentiles were used, and counts (%) were used. the probably pure viral group was excluded from statistical comparisons due to the small number of cases. bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples were stained and quantitatively cultured for bacterial pathogens and fungi. a microorganism was considered a definite cause of SCAP if it was cultured from blood. a bacterium was considered as the etiology of SCAP only if it grew from good-quality bronchial aspirates. all nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchial aspirates and BAL samples were analyzed by PCR. a multiplex PCR test kit was used to detect adenovirus, influenza A and B viruses, parainfluenza virus types 1\u20134, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, bocavirus, coronaviruses 229E, NL63, and OC43. a microorganism was considered a definite cause of SCAP if cultured from blood. a bacterium was considered as the etiology of SCAP only if it grew from good-quality bronchial aspirates or BAL. the NP swabs and 2 samples of BAL fluid or bronchial suction aspirates were sent for analysis of respiratory viruses to the Virus Diagnostics Laboratory, University of Turku. a definite diagnosis of a viral cause of SCAP required a positive PCR result in the lower respiratory tract specimens. a pure bacterial etiology was defined in 45 (92%) cases. a pure bacterial etiology was defined in 45 (92%) cases. Pneumococcus was the sole pathogen in 15 cases. of 28 patients, S. pneumoniae was cultured in 16 (57%) patients in the blood and 16 (57%) patients in the bronchial aspirate. pneumococcal antigen was positive in the urine of 25 cases (89%) pneumoniae + + F 47 +a F 55 S. pneumoniae + + M 83 S. pneumoniae + + NA M 56 S. aureus + M 68 S. pneumoniae + + F 24 +a NA F 49 S. pneumoniae + + F 73 S. pneumoniae + + M 48 S. pneumoniae + + + NA M 49 +a Probably pure viral group (n =5) F 84 Coronavirus + NA F 40 Influenza A virus + NA F 48 Rhinovirus + M 44 A influenzae M. catarrhalis + Rhinovirus + F 69 S. pneumoniae + + Coronavirus + NA F 59 +a Rhinovirus + NA M 43 S. pneumoniae + + Adenovirus + NA F 54 S. pneumoniae + + + Rhinovirus + NA F 44 S. pneumoniae + + + +a Enterovirus + + NA F 44 S. pneumoniae + + Rhinovirus + + + F 75 S. pneumoniae + + Rhinovirus + a viral etiology of SCAP was diagnosed in 24 patients (49%) of 26 viruses identified, 21 (81%) were detected from bronchial specimens, 5 (19%) were detected from NP swabs only, and both NP and bronchial PCR were positive in 7 cases. rhinovirus was detected 11 times from bronchial specimens and 4 times from nasopharyngeal swabs. two patients (8%) had 2 positive viral tests. five patients had a probably pure viral SCAP. the most common combination was S. pneumoniae and rhinovirus. alcoholism 3 (14) 5 (26) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0).44 Duration of symptoms before pneumonia diagnosis, d 2 (0\u20134) 3 (1\u20134) 2 (0\u20132) 4 (1\u20135).81 Antibiotics before hospital admission 7 (33) 7 (37) 3 (60) 1 (25) >.9 Antibiotics before blood cultures 6 (29) 8 (42) 2 (40) 1 (25) the pure viral infection group, with 5 patients, had the lowest PCT values. the bacterial\u2013viral group, with 5 patients, had the lowest PCT values (1.4 [1.0\u20131.4]) ICU mortality 0 (0) 3 (15.8) 0 (0) 0 (0).1 28-day mortality 1 (5) 4 (21) 0 (0) 0 (0).17 Hospital mortality 2 (10) 4 (21) 0 (0) 0 (0) 0 (0).4 Values are presented as No. (%) or median (25th\u201375th percentile) SAPS II 45 (38\u201357) 40 (33\u201347) 35 (33\u201339) 47 (40\u201351). APACHE, Acute Physiology and chronic health evaluation. CURB-65, confusion, urea, respiratory rate, blood pressure. the etiology of SCAP was defined in 92% of cases, which is one of the highest rates of diagnosis reported thus far. one-third of the SCAP patients were on antibiotics when etiological examinations were performed, and they therefore had positive blood cultures 2.8-fold less often than patients without previous antibiotics. the use of viral PCR was 1.8-fold higher in lower respiratory tract specimens than in NP swabs. in the present study, 11 of 15 (73%) of the rhinovirus findings were detected in lower respiratory tract samples. a commercial PCR test would have missed 53% of the rhinovirus SCAP cases compared with our in-house virus test. experimental studies have shown that in cases of respiratory bacterial\u2013viral coinfections, the eradication of bacteria did not prevent fatal outcomes as a result of influenza infection. this neutral finding has been shown among CAP patients as well [10, 18] this neutral finding has been shown among CAP patients as well. a viral etiology is more common in SCAP than has been reported so far. the presence of viral etiology does not appear to affect the outcomes of SCAP patients."}
