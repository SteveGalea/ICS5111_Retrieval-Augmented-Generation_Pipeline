{"summary": "METHODS Between March and June 2014, we invited volunteers from 2 Internet PS panels in the Netherlands to complete Internet-based surveys focusing on upper respiratory tract infections. participants could invite contacts via e-mail, by providing their own e-mail address and receiving 4 invitations for forwarding (indirect invitations), or by providing e-mail addresses of contacts with whom they had had face-to-face contact in the preceding 2 weeks. individuals were able to opt out and provide reasons for not participating participants were referred to a research Web site displaying the latest results. participants were asked to provide the number of contacts with whom they had interacted during 1 full day (\u201cyesterday\u201d). those with symptoms were asked for day of onset, symptom duration, presumed disease. data analysis We excluded participants living outside the Netherlands. we compared sociodemographic characteristics of PS participants, individuals who volunteered in our survey (seeds) and individuals recruited via respondent-driven detection. we compared symptomatic contacts recruited by symptomatic seeds and symptomatic contacts recruited by asymptomatic seeds with respect to whether they had \u201cat least one symptom\u201d or whether they had a common cold, fever, and ILI. we also compared incidence rates based on regular surveillance by the Dutch Sentinel Network (NIVEL15) statistical analysis of demographic characteristics of the general population was obtained from Statistics Netherlands. we plotted seeds and total samples separately at the 4-digit postal code level. we defined ILI as a combination of fever and at least headache or muscle pain. we excluded 288 responses for the following reasons: multiple participation (19), residence outside the Netherlands (115), and incomplete information (154; appendix A). the age distributions of both panels differed from that of the general population in that they were shifted toward older age groups. 57.4.001 66.5.001 64.8.001 57.6.023 Age, y 40.2 (23.0) 52.0 (16.2).. 53.0 (14.8) 55.0 (12.6) Educational level, bachelor\u2019s degree or higher 18.9c 56.1.001 58.9.001 43.2.001 50.6.001 Single-member household 16.7d 19.5.001 26.2e.001 17.8.238 20.7e.095 e Forty ASeedRec participants and 6 BSeedRec participants did not provide information on household members and were assumed to live alone. h Panel B volunteers were asked about hay fever and allergy. participants reporting symptoms were 6.1% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.4%, 6.9%) more likely to invite contacts to take part than were participants without symptoms. a total of 1802 invitations were sent out via the recruitment page. Recruits in ARec responded, on average, within 2.1 days. in the ARec group, 141 (36.6%) members had the same postal code. 565 (48.0%) participants reported at least one symptom. 59.5% of participants reported that they knew at least one contact person with similar symptoms. symptomatic participants mostly identified similar symptoms among household members, family members, and colleagues. the proportion in panel A by a factor of 10.4 and higher than the proportion in NIVEL by a factor of 68.8.17 TABLE 2\u2014 Detection of Symptoms in Network Chains of Seeds in the ASeedRec sample: The Netherlands, 2014 Seedsa (A) Recruits by Seeds with Symptoms (B) Recruits by Seeds Without Symptoms (C) Pb Symptom Category, No. (%) Seeds With Symptoms Seeds Without participants in ASeedRec reported a total of 22 204 contacts. proportions were higher by a factor 1.8 relative to panel A and by a factor of 11.8 relative to NIVEL. recruitment via panel B A total of 223 seeds were enrolled via panel B. BSeed had a high mean age of 52.4 years, indicating BSeed\u2019s recruitment from a younger age group. a total of 1802 invitations were sent out via the recruitment page. a total of 1802 invitations were sent out via the recruitment page. Recruits in ARec responded, on average, within 2.1 days (SD = 4.1); 43.1% did so on the day of the invitation. in the ARec group, 141 (36.6%) members had the same postal code as their recruiter. ASeedRec had crude attack rates of 7.5% for common colds and 2.5% for ILI. we estimated corresponding secondary attack rates of 29.7% and 43.2%. the incidence between weeks 5 and 8 of 2014 exceeded 51 per 100 000 population.

BSeedRec had overall attack rates of 8.9% for common colds and 1.1% for ILI. recruitment of peers by symptomatic participants led to higher rates of detection of other symptomatic patients. this is supported by the fact that symptomatic participants seemed more likely to invite contacts than participants who did not report symptoms. the majority responded within 1 week after being invited. less than half of all seeds in the 2 samples invited a contact person, a proportion not sufficient to generate long recruitment chains. a slightly higher recruitment rate was observed in this group than in BSeedRec. only 8 of the 28 seeds with ILI actually invited a recruit. only 12 recruits completed the questionnaire. motivation and participation might be much higher during the increasing phase of an influenza season. the proportion of ILI in our sample increased as a result of the participation of a select group of PS volunteers with ILI symptoms. the probability of identification of disease through respondent-driven detection depends on numerous factors, especially the type of disease being assessed, the incidence of the disease, and methodological aspects."}
