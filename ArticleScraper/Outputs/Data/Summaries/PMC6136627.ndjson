{"summary": "clinical symptoms of rickettsioses may vary depending on the rickettsial species involved. rickettsioses are among the leading causes of treatable acute febrile illnesses. rickettsioses are considered endemic in Malaysia. the patient reported onset of symptoms four days prior, having high fever (over 39 \u00b0C), headache, dry cough, sweating, diarrhoea, joint and muscular pain, appetite loss, nausea, confusion and light-headedness. he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU). he was haemodynamically stable, his lungs were clear and there was no evident hepatosplenomegaly. meropenem 1 g tds and azithromycin IV 500 mg o.d. were started on D3 and D4 post-admission for four and seven days respectively. intravenous doxycycline, the preferred choice for this case, is not available in Malaysia. ase, u/L 35 36 154 112 68 54 55 C-reactive protein, mg/L N/T 93.99 35.34 2.55 N/T >=5 * Admission day. X-rays upon admission (D1) and subsequent day (D2). multiplex PCRs were outsourced by JMC to a laboratory in west Malaysia. additional throat, nasal, and rectal swabs, and urine were collected for PCRs. a PCR product was obtained from the enterovirus protocol [24]. SFGR members R. honei (IgM 1:40, IgG 1:20), R. australis (IgM 1:40, IgG 1:40), R. conorii (IgM 1:40, IgG 1:40), R. felis (IgM 1:20, IgG 1:20), R. massiliae (IgM 1:20, IgG 1:20), indicated cross-reaction amongst the the patient was from a non-SFGR endemic region. the relatively modest IFA titers may be consistent with a primary infection. the sample was collected 15 days post-admission to hospital and 20 days post-onset of fever. et al. reported highest rickettsial seropositivity in Nabawan. 84.8% were SFGR (R. honei, then TT118 strain) and 40% of seropositive patients were agricultural workers. serology, in particular (micro)immunofluorescence assay, remains a gold standard for diagnosis. it has been suggested that this technique should only be considered in areas with previously established seroprevalence [1,33], something that has not been done in Sabah. doxycycline remains the standard treatment for spotted fever rickettsiosis. typhus and typhus-like diseases must be included in the early differential diagnosis of nonspecific fevers in Sabah. a culture of preserving acute and convalescent samples for repetition of tests to confirm diagnoses must also be encouraged."}
