{"summary": "porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) is one of the most important swine viral pathogens. it has caused significant economic losses to the swine industry worldwide. genetic variation increases the difficulty of developing effective vaccines. major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I restricted cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can kill virus-infected cells and eliminate potential sources of new virus. there is limited knowledge of the specific PRRSV-derived peptides targeted by T-cells. cDNAs were amplified based on the complete open reading frames (ORFs) of PRRSV M and murine ubiquitin (Ub) genes Total RNA was extracted from the PRRSV CH-1a strain and the spleens of BALB/c mice. the full length cDNAs were cloned into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) the expression of a truncated PRRSV M gene represents the Kozak motif or the linker sequence. a truncated M protein (85-174aa) was expressed and purified using a prokaryotic expression system. pGEX-M was transformed into E.coli BL21 (DE3). the Ub and M genes were amplified from pMD-U and pMD-M with the primer pairs Ub-F and Fusion-M-Ub-R and Fusion-M-Ub-F and M-R respectively. the fusion gene product, referred to as Ub-M, was amplified from the purified PCR products with Ub-F and M-R and inserted into the eukaryocyte expression vector pVAX1. recombinant virus recombination was performed by lipofectin-mediated co-transfection of the transferring plasmid pSC11-M and the WR strain vaccinia virus into 80% confluent TK-143 cells cultured in MEM medium containing 25 g/ml BrdU (Sigma) the viruses were collected after the appearance of cytopathic effect (CPE), and recombinant vaccinia virus was purified according BHK-21 cells were infected with either rWR-PRRSV-M or the vaccinia virus WR strain when the cells reached 70-80% confluence in a 24-well plate. the sequences of M were screened using a fluorescence microscope (LEICA DM IRE2).

IFA confirmed expression of M protein following transfection of BHK-21 cells. ELISA M protein-specific serum antibody increased steadily from the second to the fourth DNA vaccination. rWR-PRRSV-M elicited a further increase in PRRSV-specific antibody. the frequency and number of CD3+CD8+ T cells produced IFN- following stimulation with peptides derived from PRSSV M protein was enumerated using ICS and ELISPOT assays. using these approaches, we identified two peptides from PRSSV M protein that elicited IFN- production from the splenocytes of vaccinated mice. two M protein peptides stimulate IFN+ production in immunized mice. splenocytes from immunized mice were (A) stimulated with PMA and ionomycin. splenocytes from mice vaccinated with pVAX1-Ub-M responded strongly to \"K93FITSRCRL\" and \"F57GYMTFVHF\" at all time points tested following the booster vaccination with rWR-PRRSV-M. statistically significant differences were noted for the peptides \"K93FITSRCRL\" and \"F57GYMTFVHF\" the same pattern of reactivity on days 3, 5 and 12 after boosting with rWR-PRRSV-M within each vaccination group were analyzed. the numbers 1-27 represent different peptides derived from M protein of PRRSV Ch-1a strain; number 28 is an irrelevant peptide control; PC is an unstimulated negative control; BC is a background control. in some cases, specific peptide epitopes are known to be recognized by cytotoxic T cells. for example, the core region of HCV contains an epitope that is recognized by cytotoxic T cells of both mice and humans [19] further research on the role of these peptide epitopes in different species is ongoing in our laboratory. the recombinant vaccinia virus rWR-PRRSV-M drove expression of an M protein with the expected molecular weight when transfected into BHK-21 cells. the eukaryotic expression plasmid pVAX1-Ub-M coding sequence was fused in-frame with the PRRSV M coding sequence. the recombinant vaccinia virus rWR-PRRSV-M drove expression of an M protein with the control mice vaccinated with pVAX1-Ub-M generated significantly higher M protein-specific antibody titers compared to mice vaccinated with pVAX1 or PBS. rWR-PRRSV-M amplifies the protective effects of DNA vaccination and reveals the advantage of this priming-boosting strategy. peptides K93FITSRCRL and F57GYMTFVHF elicited IFN- production from splenocytes of vaccinated mice. peptides K93FITSRCRL and F57GYMTFVHF elicited IFN- production from splenocytes of vaccinated mice. in contrast, unstimulated splenocytes and splenocytes exposed to an irrevelant two M protein peptides stimulate IFN+ production in splenocytes from immunized mice. the peptides \"K93FITSRCRL\" and \"F57GYMTFVHF\" were stained with antibodies to identify IFN production in CD8+ T cells. statistically significant differences were noted for the peptides \"K93FITSRCRL\" and \"F57GYMTFVHF\" when compared to the other peptides tested among mice vaccinated and boosted with pVAX1-Ub-M and rWR-PRRSV-M respectively. no difference between the stimuli was observed with mock-vaccinated (pVAX1) mice and nave mice. the ELISPOT assay assesses the number of IFN-+ cells among all splenocyte cell types. each method clearly identified K93FITSRCRL and F57GYMTFVHF as the only two peptides from a panel of 27 that elited significant IFN- production from splenocytes. -2Kd and H-2Dd restricted CTL epitopes, respectively. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
