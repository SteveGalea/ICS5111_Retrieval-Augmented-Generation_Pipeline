{"summary": "many animal welfare agencies use relocation programs to decrease shelter euthanasia rates across the country. however, there are few and sometimes conflicting guidelines for either minimum standards or best practices. concerns about the frequency of infectious diseases are commonly raised in the context of animal relocation. URI in relocated cats should be proactively managed by animal welfare agencies. cats account for 3.2 million of these animals, approximately 26.9% of which are euthanized [1]. companion animal relocation programs have been developed across the country. study was performed at a privately operated animal shelter in the state of washington from May 2016 to November 2016. URI, FPV and dermatophytosis in cats transported through an established relocation program in the state of washington are linked to stress. URI in shelters has specifically been linked to stress. cats originating from outside of the state required a certificate of veterinary inspection (health certificate) the majority of cases followed these relocation criteria, with exception of 9 individual kittens that were not FVRCP vaccinated prior to relocation. the first date of development of illness consistent with the case definition was recorded for each cat if pertinent. URI, FPV and dermatophytosis were calculated and reported as the number of relocated cats meeting the case definition divided by the total number of relocated cats. a mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to examine factors associated with URI while accounting for potential similarities among cats from the same source agency. study was performed at a privately operated animal shelter in washington. total cat intake for the shelter in 2016 was 1461, with a cat adoption rate of 91%. study data were collected from all 430 cats admitted to the shelter via the relocation program during the study period in 2016. the first date of development of illness consistent with the case definition was recorded for each cat if pertinent. additional information was collected for each cat including age, source agency, time in transport (hours spent in travel), outcome at destination (adopted, died or euthanized) and length of stay at destination (total days spent within destination agency) URI, FPV and dermatophytosis were calculated and reported as the number of relocated cats meeting the case definition divided by the total number of relocated cats. a mixed-effects logistic regression model was used to examine factors associated with URI while accounting for potential similarities among cats from the same source agency. 430 relocated cats entered the destination agency from 18 source agencies. the average age of cats was 1.6 years (range: 1 week to 15 years) there were 199 kittens (46.3%), defined as younger than five months of age, and 231 adult cats (53.7%) five months of age or older. 91 cats diagnosed with URI had known outcomes, average length of stay at destination agency averaged 8.4 days. sixty-nine were adopted (97.8%), 1 died (1.1%) and 1 was euthanized (1.1%). variable category OR (95% CI) p-Value Age (n = 430) 5 months Referent --- 5 months 0.7 (0.5\u20131.1) 0.1 Time in transport (n = 430) N/A 1.0 (1.0\u20131.1) 0.0 * Length of stay at destination agency 7 days Referent --- 8\u201314 days 3.3 (1.4\u20137.8) 0.0 * 15\u201321 days 6.5 (2.8\u201315.2) 0.0 * 22 days 12.1 (5.9\u201324 430 relocated cats entered the destination agency from 18 source agencies. the average age of cats was 1.6 years (range: 1 week to 15 years) of the 398 relocated cats with known outcomes, the average length of stay at the destination agency was 18.1 days. none of the 111 cats diagnosed with FPV were diagnosed with URI or dermatophytosis. five-nine affected cats (53.2%) were kittens and 52 (46.9%) were adults. time to URI diagnosis after intake at the destination agency averaged 8.4 days. only one cat had an available date of diagnosis, 14 days post-intake at the destination agency. all four cats diagnosed with dermatophytosis were adopted from the destination agency, with an average length of stay of 36 days. URI was the most common feline infectious disease of those tracked at the destination agency after relocation. URI was the most common feline infectious disease of those tracked at the destination agency after transport. URI prevalence varies widely due to different environmental, management and population-based factors, including feline housing, population density, sanitation practices and vaccination protocols. one study documented that 45% of cats start re-shedding feline herpesvirus after incurring a stressful event such as entering a new shelter or being rehoused [18] the prevalence of FPV within shelter populations is undocumented. sporadic FPV cases and outbreaks are still seen throughout american shelters. the prevalence of FPV within shelter populations is undocumented. report on the prevalence of dermatophytosis within shelter populations is sparse. the lower prevalence of dermatophytosis (0.9%) noted in the current study may be explained by geographical differences in sampling or may be related to the disease course itself. more than half (53.2%) of the 111 cats affected with URI in this study were kittens younger than five months of age. their average time to URI diagnosis was six days (range: 0 to 22 days) URI in kittens, who are perhaps less likely to be latently infected compared to older cats, is possibly reflective of infections acquired as a result of novel exposure in the shelter. studies have documented this as a risk factor for URI in shelter populations [15,16,25] requiring longer lengths of stay increases the URI incidence in shelters due to the pathophysiology and clinical nature of URI in shelter populations. minimizing shelter length of stay is critical for URI management from an individual animal perspective. this is the first study on infectious disease prevalence surrounding feline relocation to provide data-based insights on otherwise anecdotal concerns regarding animal relocation. the study design did have limitations: first, no information was available on feline health status, environmental factors or average length of stay of cats at the source agencies. infectious disease incidence rate at the destination agency was not calculated. it would have provided a contrasting view of the infectious disease risk for relocated cats versus other cats in the destination agency. this study did not investigate all potential factors that might contribute to shelter URI within the destination agency. the development of URI in shelters is a predictable concern when relocating cats. factors associated with URI in cats following transport include younger age, longer time in transport and increased length of stay at the destination agency."}
