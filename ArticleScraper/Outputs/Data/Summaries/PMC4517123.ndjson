{"summary": "the establishment of an antiviral state in cells has resulted in the discovery of interferons (IFNs) the antiviral activities of IFNs are mediated by the induction of IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) products. rhabdoviruses are pathogens with a particularly broad host range among a great variety of organisms including plants, insects, fish, mammals, reptiles and crustaceans. zoonosis still accounts for 50,000 deaths per year worldwide despite the availability of effective vaccines. rhabdovirus virions have a bullet-like shape, conical at one end and flat at the other, with a diameter of 75 nm and a length of 100\u2013300 nm. onucleoprotein (RNP) is enwrapped in a lipid bilayer, which is acquired from host cell membrane. the matrix protein (M) and the glycoprotein (G) are membrane-associated proteins. the G protein is an integral transmembrane protein involved in viral entry. the life cycle of rhabdoviruses is entirely cytoplasmic. the nascent antigenome and the genome are encapsidated by the N protein. specific transfer of the N protein to viral RNAs is mediated by the P protein. the neo-synthesized genomic RNPs serve either as templates for additional rounds of transcription and/or replication. NF-B is composed of homo- and heterodimeric complexes of members of the Rel family. most common and best-characterized form of NF-B is the p65/p50 heterodimer. TLR3 detects double-stranded (ds) RNA, while TLR7 and TLR8 recognize single-stranded (ss) RNA and TLR9 recognize unmethylated DNA with CpG motifs. most other cell types also recognize viral RNA through RLRs. TLR3-deficient mice were as capable as wild-type to clear VSV infection [18]. however, TLR3-deficient mice showed reduced susceptibility to a pathogenic RABV strain [19], which could be attributed to the involvement of TLR3 in the formation of viral Negri bodies rather than its implication in IFN response. IFNs include IFN, IFN, IFN, IFN and IFN. a single gene encodes each Type I IFN, with the exception of IFN. a single gene encodes each Type I IFN, with the exception of IFN. expression of IFNLR1 is largely restricted to epithelial cells. a large number of cell types respond very poorly or have no response at all to Type III IFNs. microRNAs (miRNAs) induced by IFNs emerged as novel regulators of viral infection. kinase (PKR) and the 2\u2032-5\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetases function through RNase L. IFN treatment induces the expression of hundreds of ISGs. but only a selection of their products have been demonstrated to be responsible for the inhibition of VSV replication. ISG20, a 3\u2032-5\u2032 exonuclease, degrades single stranded viral RNA [37], PML inhibits secondary transcription [41,42], PKR [47] and IFIT [38] proteins inhibit viral translation. the effect of the other human antiviral mediators on RABV is still unknown. IFITM proteins belong to the CD225 protein superfamily. mice have two other IFITM genes: IFITM6 and IFITM7. early observation of IFITM proteins controlling viral infection was reported in 1996 [57], where overexpression of IFITM1 was shown to inhibit VSV replication. however, IFITM3 is the most potent IFITM family member in restricting viral replication in cell culture [61] 25HC-mediated virus inhibition is not specific to a particular structural class of viral fusion proteins. inhibition is not linked to either pH-dependent or pH-independent fusion processes. authors do not exclude that the Ch25h protein may have additional antiviral mechanisms to 25HC. cytoplasmic forms inhibit VSV and other RNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus such as influenza virus. cytoplasmic forms inhibit VSV and other RNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus such as rabies virus. the variability of the C-terminal region is important for the specific function of each PML isoform. PML confers resistance to RNA and DNA viruses from different families. this has been shown in cells stably expressing individual PML isoforms or in cells depleted for PML by RNA interference. PMLIV exerts intrinsic anti-VSV activity by interacting with a viral or cellular protein required for VSV replication. this anti-RABV effect exerted by PMLIV is independent of IFN production. further investigations are needed to elucidate mechanism of action of PMLIV against RABV. IFN and many inducers that activate IRFs induce expression. strongest IFIT inducers are Types I and III IFNs. IFIT1 inhibits viral translation by two different mechanisms (eIF3 and cap-RNA binding) it uses its N-terminal and central region to bind to RNA, whereas its C-terminal binds eIF3. overexpression of IFIT3 in vero cells results in a 1 log decrease of virus titer. GBP1 There are at least two forms of IFN-induced Guanylate Binding Proteins in human and murine cells. they belong to the dynamin superfamily of large GTPases characterized by an oligomerization-dependent GTPase activity. overexpression of human GBP-1 inhibits 0.5 log VSV production. PKR/, RNaseL/, Mx1/ MEFs IFN still inhibits VSV replication revealing the existence of other pathways. p53/ mice Are more sensitive to VSV compared to parental mice. resistance to VSV conferred by Ifit2 was restricted to neurons. both Tetherin/ and parental mice have similar tissue viral burdens after systemic infection with VSV. the binding of Type II IFN to its receptor, IFNGR, results in the phosphorylation of STAT1 by JAK1 and JAK2. STAT1 homodimers migrate to the nucleus and bind to a DNA element called GAS (gamma-activated sequence) ISG products exhibiting antiviral activity are encoded by ISGs. they act cooperatively to confer viral resistance by inhibiting various stages of viral replication. these factors are highly constitutively expressed and are able to exert an intrinsic antiviral activity independently of IFN. oligoadenylate synthetases have been shown to be implicated in antiviral defense. ectopic expression and gene silencing experiments have identified many novel ISGs with antiviral activity against viruses from various families [26,44]. IFI35 negatively regulates RIG-I activation and mediates its proteasomal degradation through ubiquitination [53]. Whether the requirement of IFI35 is specific to VSV infection is still unknown. ducible transmembrane (IFITM) genes are enhanced by cell treatment with IFNs since they contain the ISREs in their promoter. in humans, there are at least four functional members of IFITM proteins. mice have two other IFITM genes: IFITM6 and IFITM7. the cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) has been identified as a broadly antiviral ISG through a systematic functional screen. it has been shown that Ch25h inhibits growth of VSV and a wide-range of enveloped viruses through the production of a soluble antiviral factor that is not IFN. the viral restriction mediated by 25HC occurs at an early stage. Mx proteins are classified as large dynamin-like GTPases due to their similarities to dynamins. dynamins share structural and functional aspects including domain organization, GTPase activity and homo-oligomerization capacity. the human MxA and MxB proteins [35] are cytoplasmic, while the Mx1 protein has a speckled nuclear localization in both mouse and rat cells. tif protein 19 belongs to the TRIM family that comprises over 70 members whose functions span a broad array of physiological processes. PML NBs recruit a growing number of proteins implicated in different cellular processes including apoptosis, senescence, protein degradation and antiviral defense [73,74,75,76]. PMLIII and PMLIV exert their intrinsic anti-VSV activity by interacting with a viral or a cellular protein required for VSV replication. resistance to VSV exerted by PMLIV occurs via two independent mechanisms. ISG20 is transcriptionally induced by both Types I and II IFNs. it is strictly dependent upon the activation and binding of IRF1 to a specific ISRE on the ISG20 promoter. ISG20 overexpression in HeLa cells reduces VSV mRNA and protein synthesis. this anti-VSV activity of ISG20 is reduced in cells expressing the inactive exonuclease mutant form of the protein. three members are expressed in mice, ifit1 (also named ISG56), ifit2 (also named ISG58) and ifit3 (also named ISG49) the cognate members of two species have distinct sequences. for example, human IFIT2 and mouse Ifit2 are only 62% homologous. expression of Tetherin in HEK293 cells confers resistance to VSV. Tetherin impairs a late step in the VSV replication cycle. IFITM proteins belong to the CD225 protein superfamily, which can be found in nearly every domain of life, ranging from bacteria to invertebrates to primates. in humans, there are at least four functional members of IFITM proteins. mice have two other IFITM genes: IFITM6 and IFITM7. the cholesterol-25-hydroxylase (Ch25h) has been identified as a broadly antiviral ISG through a systematic functional screen. it has been shown that Ch25h inhibits growth of VSV and a wide-range of enveloped viruses through the production of a soluble antiviral factor. human Mx1 and Mx2 gene products are MxA and MxB. they are classified as large dynamin-like GTPases due to their similarities to dynamins. PML/TRIM19 PML belongs to the TRIM family that comprises over 70 members whose functions span a broad array of physiological processes. PML NBs recruit a growing number of proteins implicated in different cellular processes including apoptosis, senescence, protein degradation and antiviral defense. PML is covalently conjugated to small ubiquitin modifier (SUMO) PMLIII and PMLIV exert their intrinsic anti-VSV activity. resistance to VSV exerted by PMLIV occurs via two independent mechanisms. PMLIII is able to inhibit VSV replication in an IFN-independent manner. PMLIV is also able to positively regulate IFN synthesis. ISG20 is transcriptionally induced by both Types I and II IFNs. induction by IFN is strictly dependent upon the activation and binding of IRF1 to a specific ISRE on the ISG20 promoter. ISG20 overexpression in HeLa cells reduces VSV mRNA and protein synthesis resulting in a 0.5 log inhibition of viral production. members have been characterized, IFIT1 (also named ISG56), IFIT2 (also named ISG54), IFIT3 (also named ISG60) and IFIT5 (also named ISG58) three members are expressed in mice, ifit1 (also named ISG56), ifit2 (also named ISG54) and ifit3 (also named ISG49) expression of Tetherin in HEK293 cells confers resistance to VSV. Tetherin impairs a late step in the VSV replication cycle. PKR/ mice are more susceptible to VSV infection and die from acute infection of the respiratory tract. IFN/ is unable to rescue PKR/ mice from VSV infection. fibroblasts derived from PML knockout mice, PML/ MEFs, exhibited enhanced VSV and RABV multiplication. p53/ mice were more susceptible to VSV compared to parental mice. RABV replicates slowly and requires the host cell to remain intact. the matrix protein (M) plays a major role in viral assembly and budding. the VSV M protein is also responsible for the cytopathic effects associated with VSV infection. mutation of critical residues M51, E213, V221 and S226 in VSV M have been shown to abolish the ability of M to inhibit host RNA synthesis and thereby IFN production. this inhibition is done by inactivating the basal transcription factor TFIID, subsequently inhibiting polymerase II-mediated transcription of host genes. the RABV-P gene encodes a full length (P1) and four N-terminally truncated isoforms (P2-P5) from the initial and subsequent internal, in frame Met codons at indicated residues. RABV-P protein contains three functional domains separated by two intrinsically disordered regions. CE(NiN) induced the expression of the IFN gene less efficiently than in the parental Ni-CE strain. this suggests that such a deficiency in the N protein contributes to the defective pathogenicity of the Ni-CE strain. RABV-P is not the only protein derived from the P gene acting as an IFN antagonist. the P gene encodes the full length P protein, as well as four N-terminally truncated protein isoforms (P2\u2013P5). RABV-P has a mechanism to inhibit IFN signaling. RABV P neither induces STAT1 degradation nor interferes with STAT1 phosphorylation. last 30 residues of P are required to bind STAT. retention of STAT proteins in the cytoplasm is mediated by P1 and P2 proteins. RABV P isoforms P3 inhibits STAT nuclear translocation and IFN signaling. pSTAT1 homodimers migrate to the nucleus and bind to the GAS. pSTAT1 homodimers migrate to the nucleus and bind to the GAS. binding and sequestration of pSTAT1 in either subcellular compartment inhibits the interaction of pSTAT1 with ISRE promoter elements in the DNA. the ability of the P protein to target pSTAT1 in both compartments thus appears to be another demonstration of the functional efficiency of this protein. RABV infection before IFN treatment abolishes the capacity of this cytokine to induce the expression of ISGs [123] the anti-VSV and anti-RABV properties of PMLIV require its localization within the NBs. the matrix protein (M) plays a major role in viral assembly and budding. the VSV M protein is responsible for the cytopathic effects associated with VSV infection. nucleoporin Nup98 and Rae are ISGs. inhibition of nuclear export by M may affect aspects of the cellular IFN response. RABV phosphoprotein P (40 kDa) plays a central role in viral and host protein interactions. a small region of the P protein, within residues 176\u2013186, has been shown to be important for the IRF blocking activity of RABV P. this region is also involved in viral pathogenicity in vivo, although the precise molecular interactions involved remain to be resolved. the RABV N protein (50 kDa) encapsidates the genomic RNA [113] and thus is essential for the replication of the genome. the N protein does not act as an independent antagonist of IFN signaling. the activation of RIG-I was severely inhibited in cells infected with the Nishigahara and CE(NiN) strains. this suggests that the inhibition of the NF-B pathway is crucial for early IFN expression. RABV-P is not the only protein derived from the P gene acting as an IFN antagonist. the P gene encodes the full length P protein, as well as four N-terminally truncated protein isoforms (P2\u2013P5). RABV P interacts with STAT1 and STAT2 and blocks IFN signaling. the last 30 residues of P are required to bind STAT. the retention of STAT proteins in the cytoplasm is mediated by P1 and P2 proteins. the interaction of Type I IFN with IFNAR leads to the activation of the JAK tyrosine kinases (Tyk2 and JAK1). ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of ISGs that harbor an ISRE. pSTAT1 homodimers migrate to the nucleus and bind to the GAS. different viral proteins colocalize with PML on NBs before disrupting them. RABV infection reorganizes PML NBs, causing them to become larger and appear as dense aggregates. reorganization of PML NBs analogous to that observed in RABV infected cells. new antiviral ISGs have been identified and characterized for their contributions to intrinsic and innate immune antiviral activities. they encode distinct proteins with a diverse range of biological functions that directly block various stages of the viral life cycle. particular ISGs have also been implicated in innate immunity, by positively regulating IFN production, thus reinforcing viral resistance."}
