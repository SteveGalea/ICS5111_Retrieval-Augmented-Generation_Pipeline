Flow cytometry data were analyzed using FlowJo cytometry analysis software. a mammalian expression plasmid for receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) was transfected into HEK 293T cells. transductions were normalized to transduce into TIM-1-transfected cells. protein expression was determined by immunoblotting with goat anti-TIM-1 antisera (R&D Systems) and RAGE antisera (Abcam l--Phosphatidylcholine (PtdChl) and l--phosphatidyl-l-serine (PtdSer) liposomes were generated as previously described. lipids were dissolved in chloroform, dried, resuspended in PBS, and sonicated for 5 min on ice. HEK 293T cells were seeded into a 48-well plate and transduced supernatant aliquots were collected and stored at 80\u00b0C. infections with vero cells were performed similarly in the presence or absence of ARD5 (1 g/ml) ARD5 was also added to fresh medium for wells infected with ARD5. a mouse was infected intranasally with 2 107 infectious units of GP-VSV in 1% methylcellulose. organs were homogenized in 1 PBS using a tissue tearer. supernatants were serially diluted and incubated with or without ARD5. plates were washed thoroughly between steps with 1 TBS+. absorbance was read at 450 nm. HA- and HIS-tagged recombinant annexin V was purified from DH5 cells. soluble HA-tagged TIM-1, TIM-4, and Axl were generated by replacing the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with an HA tag sequence and stop codon. ELISAs using inhibitors of TIM-1 binding were performed as described above using 1 l of concentrated TIM-1 supernatants per well. EBOV GP pseudovirions were added at an MOI of 2.25. enough No GP pseudovirions were added to achieve similar fluorescence. cells were washed 3 times with 1 PBS plus 5% FBS. EBOV, full-length EBOV, and MARV GP pseudovirion transductions into mutant TIM-1- and WT TIM-1-expressing HEK 293T cells in the absence of ARD5 were normalized to TIM-1 expression. expression was determined by flow cytometry as described above and measured as a percentage of antibody-positive cells. empty vector and N114A and D115A constructs were calculated from the fitted curve to be 7.57 107, 8.10 104, 3.42 104, and 4.25 104 respectively. H3 cells are a clonal population of HEK 293T cells that stably express TIM-1 due to integration a transfected TIM-1 expression plasmid (20. MARV and EBOV FL pseudotyped virions were concentrated by centrifuging supernatants at 5,380 g overnight at 4\u00b0C. pellet was resuspending in 500 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.5. reaction solution was dialyzed using 10,000-molecular-weight-cutoff. no GP VP40-GFP VLPs were generated by transfecting HEK 293T cells with a plasmid expressing EBOV VP40 fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) to produce FIV pseudovirions, HEK 293T cells were transfected with three plasmids as previously described (20, 38) aliquoted or concentrated 200-fold by 16-h centrifugation at 5,380 g at 4\u00b0C. recombinant, replication-competent VSV expressing the EBOV GP with the mucin domain deleted and EGFP in place of the G glycoprotein (EBOV GP-rVSV-EGFP) was produced as previously described (20) the predicted TIM-1 IgV structures were generated by threading the TIM-1 amino acid sequence on the murine TIM-1 (mTIM-1) (2OR8) (40), mTIM-3 (2OYP) (41), or mTIM-4 (3B19) (28) crystal structures were manipulated and rendered using the PyMOL software program (43).

EGFP expression was assessed 24 h later by flow cytometry. hek 293T cells were seeded into a 48-well plate and transduced with pseudovirions in the presence or absence of PtdChl or PtdSer liposomes at various concentrations. cells were reseeded into 6-well plates pretreated with poly-l-lysine (Invitrogen) cells were infected 48 h after transfection with an MOI of 0.001, 0.01, or 0.1 for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed 3 with 1 PBS and refreshed with medium. images were processed to detect total cells by counting nuclei and infected cells by GFP expression. data are expressed as the percentage of infected cells in the total cell population compare to that for untreated cells. ELISA plates were precoated overnight with 5.2 106 transducing units of concentrated EBOV pseudovirions or PtdSer or PtdChl liposomes (50 M) diluted in 1 TBS+ (150 mM NaCl, 25 mM Tris, and 10 mM CaCl2, pH 7.2) plates were blocked for 2 h at 4\u00b0C with 1 TBS+ with 2% bovine serum albumin (BSA), incubated supernatants were collected 48 h after transfection, filtered through 0.2-m filters, aliquoted, and stored at 80\u00b0C. HA-tagged TIM-1, TIM-4, and Axl were generated by replacing transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains with an HA tag sequence and stop codon. FITC-labeled EBOV GP- or No GP-VSV pseudovirions were added at an MOI of 2.25. cells were washed 3 times with 1 PBS plus 5% FBS. ARD5 (2 g/ml) or PtdSer or PtdChl liposomes (25 M) were also added as needed. a 0.36-g amount of EBOV GP-VLPs and 0.48 g No GP-VLPs were added per 10,000 cells. some cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 30 min to allow internalization. the EBOV GP-rVSV curves had r2 values of 0.9708 (WT), 0.9577 (empty vector), 0.9889 (N114A construct), and 0.9737 (D115A construct) the 50% infective doses (ID50) for the WT, empty vector, and N114A and D115A constructs were calculated from the fitted curve to be 7.57 107, 8.10 104, 3.42 104, and 4.25 104. the human TIM-1 IgV sequence threaded on the mTIM-1 structure strongly resembled mTIM-1, with the PtdSer binding pockets being comparable (Fig. 1B) the human TIM-1 IgV sequence threaded on the mTIM-1 structure strongly resembled mTIM-1, with the PtdSer binding pockets being comparable (Fig. 1B) transfected cells were transduced with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudovirions that express EGFP as a reporter molecule in place of native G (VSVG) VSV was pseudotyped with either EBOV GP that has a deleted mucin domain or as a control, Lassa virus (LASV) GPC. most TIM-1 mutations had no deleterious effect on transduction. mutation of TIM-1 PtdSer binding pocket also reduced transduction of EBOV FL GP or MARV GP pseudovirions. at 48 h, transfected cells were transduced with EBOV GP-VSVG (A), LASV GPC-VSVG (B), MARV GP-VSVG (C), or full-length EBOV-VSVG (C) pseudovirions. TIM-1 mutants were evaluated for their ability to support a recombinant, infectious VSV/GFP (rVSV) that encodes and expresses EBOV GP (EBOV GP/rVSV) findings from these infections were similar to the transduction studies with N114A and D115A TIM-1 mutants, providing little to no increased infection above that with the empty vector. competition studies were performed in HEK 293T cells stably expressing TIM-1 (20), in the presence of increasing concentrations of PtdSer or phosphatidylcholine (PtdChl) liposomes. similar liposomes have been used previously to inhibit HIV-1 infection. EGTA in PBS plus 10% FBS was incubated on Vero cells for 1 h before pseudovirions were added for 4 h. medium was replaced, and transduction was assessed after 24 h. HEK 293T supernatants containing HA-tagged soluble Axl were incubated with ELISA plates prebound with EBOV pseudovirions. anxV is a cellular protein that binds to PtdSer (52) and detects PtdSer on the surface of apoptotic cells. anxV bound to EBOV pseudovirion-coated ELISA plates in a dose-dependent manner but not to plates lacking pseudovirions. HA-tagged soluble TIM-1 in HEK 293T cells bound to virus and PtdSer liposomes. anti-TIM-1 MAbs ARD5 and A6G2, PtdSer liposomes, and EGTA, all of which dramatically inhibited TIM-1 binding to pseudovirions. these included the anti-TIM-1 MAbs ARD5 and A6G2, PtdSer liposomes, and EGTA, all of which dramatically inhibited TIM-1 binding. TIM-1 enhances entry of VSVG pseudotyped with a wide range of viral GPs. we hypothesize that if TIM-1 enhancement was dependent on PtdSer binding, TIM-1 should enhance entry of VSVG pseudotyped with other viral GPs. TIM-1-enhanced transduction of RRV, GP64, and CHIKV pseudovirions was inhibited by PtdSer liposomes. inhibition of LASV is likely an off-target effect for LASV. EBOV GP FIV was more modestly enhanced by TIM-1 than EBOV VSV. vector, ND115DN mutant of TIM-1, or WT TIM-1. MOIs were determined in untransfected HEK 293T cells. percent inhibition is calculated relative to no-antibody control. data are shown as means SEM for at least three replicates. for panels A and B, significance was calculated using a two-sample student t test with equal variance. for panels C and G, significance was calculated using one-sample t-test comparison. TIM-1 enhanced SINV pseudovirion transduction through a PtdSer-dependent mechanism. the ability of TIM-1 to enhance transduction of pseudovirions lacking an intact RBD suggests that TIM-1-mediated enhancement is independent of receptor binding by the glycoprotein RBD. FITC-labeled EBOV and No GP pseudovirions (B and C) or VP40-GFP VLPs (D and E) were added at 4\u00b0C to vero cells that were prebound with or without ARD5 (2 g/ml) or PtdChl or PtdSer liposomes (25 M) ARD5 and PtdSer liposomes inhibited internalization of both viruses. TIM-1 enhances the entry of replication-competent EBOV, EBOV GP/rVSV, and dengue virus (DV) RRV and AcMNPV infection is enhanced by TIM-1 expression. titers were determined by endpoint dilution on vero cells. TIM-1 expression increased entry of baculovirus by 6-fold. TIM-1+ H3 cells with recombinant baculovirus expressed -Gal at an MOI of 0.003 as determined from titers on HEK 293T cells. after 48 h of incubation with virus, cells were lysed and -Gal activity was assessed using the Galacto-Light system. EBOV GP/rVSV was obtained from lung, spleen, and kidney homogenates of an interferon-/ receptor knockout mouse 4 days after intranasal infection. ARD5 inhibited virus infection at all dilutions regardless of the organ of origin. HEK 293T cells were transfected with TIM-1 mutants in parallel with wild-type (WT) TIM-1 and an empty-vector control. all mutants but one had >70% of WT surface expression as assessed by surface staining of transfected cells with four different anti-TIM-1 MAbs. VSV was pseudotyped with either EBOV GP that has a deleted mucin domain or as a control, Lassa virus (LASV) GPC. this construct confers the same tropism as full-length Ebola virus GP and produces higher pseudovirus titers (35, 48, 49) transfected cells were transduced with EBOV GP-VSVG (A), LASV GPC-VSVG (B), MARV GP-VSVG (C), or full-length EBOV-VSVG (C) pseudovirions. at 48 h, transfected cells were transduced with mutant TIM-1 constructs. mutagenesis of two additional residues, Y38 and D99, decreased EBOV transduction but not surface expression of TIM-1. mutagenesis of these residues may alter the IgV domain structure without altering the overall stability of the protein. similar liposomes have been used previously to inhibit HIV-1 infection (51) and uptake of apoptotic cells and virus by TIM-1 (26, 33) transduction was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by the presence of PtdSer liposomes, with a 2.5 M concentration abolishing transduction. HEK 293T supernatants containing HA-tagged soluble Axl, mSAP, TIM-1, TIM-4, or mutants of TIM-1, N114D or D115N were incubated with ELISA plates prebound with EBOV pseudovirions. data are shown as means SEM for at least three replicates. anxV is a cellular protein that binds to PtdSer (52) and detects PtdSer on the surface of apoptotic cells. anxV bound to EBOV pseudovirion-coated ELISA plates in a dose-dependent manner but not to plates lacking pseudovirions. HA-tagged soluble TIM-1 in HEK 293T cell supernatants bound to virus and PtdSer liposomes. the ability for TIM-1 and TIM-4 to bind pseudovirions may suggest that all PtdSer binding receptors may enhance EBOV entry. the receptor for advance glycation end products (RAGE) did not enhance EBOV transduction into HEK 293T cells. VSVG virions were pseudotyped with the alphavirus Ross River virus (RRV) GP or Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) env or baculovirus Autographa californica nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcMNPV) GP64. transduction of these pseudoviruses into 293T cells and TIM-1+ H3 cells was evaluated in parallel with that of EBOV GP and LASV GPC transduction of LASV is unaffected by TIM-1 expression in HEK 293T cells. inhibition is likely an off-target effect for LASV. EBOV GP FIV was more modestly enhanced by TIM-1 than EBOV GP VSV. Pseudovirions were plotted on the x axis based on fold enhancement of transduction in H3 cells over that in HEK 293T cells. -Gal expression in lysates was assessed using the Galacto-Light system. anxV substitutes for the TIM-1 IgV domain. the chimeric construct (AnxVIgV-TIM-1) was expressed in transfected cells at levels equivalent to that of WT TIM-1 as detected by a TIM-1 polyclonal antiserum. the TIM-1 domain-specific MAb ARD5 does not bind to AnxVIgV-TIM-1. the ability of TIM-1 to enhance transduction of pseudovirions lacking an intact RBD suggests that TIM-1-mediated enhancement is independent of receptor binding by the glycoprotein RBD. FITC labeled both EBOV GP-VSV pseudovirions and VSV pseudovirions without an envelope GP (No GP) some cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 30 min, whereas others remained on ice. some cells were shifted to 37\u00b0C for 30 min, whereas others were on ice. dChl liposomes demonstrated that enveloped virus is internalized into TIM-1-expressing cells in the absence of a viral glycoprotein. TIM-1 enhances replication-competent EBOV, EBOV GP/rVSV, and dengue virus (DV) expression in either HEK 293T or H3 cells increased entry of baculovirus by 6-fold. EBOV infection was sensitive to inhibition by PtdSer liposomes. RRV and AcMNPV infection is enhanced by TIM-1 expression. vero cells were preincubated for 1 h with the indicated concentrations of PtdSer or PtdChl liposomes or medium alone. cells were then challenged in the presence of the liposomes with replication-competent EBOV encoding GFP. after 24 h, the GFP from one round of infection can be detected. ARD5 inhibited virus infection at all dilutions, regardless of the organ of origin. TIM-1 enhances infection of a variety of unrelated enveloped viruses by binding to virion-associated PtdSer, leading to virus internalization. mutagenesis studies initially focused on identifying TIM-1 residues that impact filovirus infection. we identified eight residues critical for EBOV infection that line and surround the PtdSer binding pocket of the TIM IgV domain. a subset of these residues is critical for PtdSer binding (28) jemielity et al. found that TIM-1 mediates infection of a broader range of viruses than previously appreciated through a PtdSer-dependent mechanism. however, not all pseudovirion data, such as those for CHIKV, have been confirmed with WT virus. TIM-1 mediates virus uptake through binding of virion-associated PtdSer. it is a second cellular receptor that mediates virus entry in a PtdSer-dependent manner. apoptosis may contribute to the accumulation of PtdSer on the surface of virions, since many viruses induce this type of cell killing. we are able to detect PtdSer in LASV GPC pseudovirions. TIM-1 ectopic expression on DG/ cells may reveal that TIM-1 is able to enhance LASV entry. however, contrary to these possible explanations, expression of TIM-1 did not enhance transduction of SARS coronavirus isolates. glycan cloud that is only removed once the virus has internalized into endosomes (8, 9) the role of the receptor binding domain of the viral GP may relegate the role of the receptor binding domain to endosomal functions. for filoviruses, these functions would include intracellular binding of NPC1 and subsequent fusion events. a recent study using VSV G found that proteinaceous receptors are not necessary for fusion (68), suggesting that once virions are internalized, endosomal conditions are sufficient to drive viral GP/cell membrane association and fusion. however, internalization of enveloped viruses independent of a GP would suggest that this second receptor is also a PVEER. hepatitis A virus was recently shown to cloak itself in host-derived membranes. the presence of TIM-1 on these membranes might explain the use of hepatitis A virus as a receptor."}
