{"summary": "we studied 60 episodes of respiratory symptoms in 71 lung transplant patients. almost half of these episodes were of unknown infectious etiology. despite this rigorous testing, a considerable number of episodes of respiratory symptoms remain unresolved. specific treatment is available for most bacterial and fungal pathogens and some viruses. a rapid confirmation reduces unnecessary diagnostic steps. excluding potential transmissible pathogens as source of the etiology is therefore equally important as their confirmation. the ethics committee of the canton of Zurich approved the study and written informed consent was obtained from all participants. none of the transplant donors were from a vulnerable population and all donors or next of kin provided written informed consent that was freely given. 125 mg on postoperative day 1 and 2). Maintenance immunosuppression included mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone and a calcineurin inhibitor, primarily cyclosporine. all prophylactic regimens were usually prescribed lifelong. Throat swab samples were collected in 3 ml virus transport medium. samples were centrifuged at 1500 rpm for 5 min and the supernatant filtered through a 0.45 m filter. RNA and DNA were amplified in two separate workflows. both workflows were pooled in equal amounts for library construction with NexteraXT. reads were quality-filtered and cleaned from non-viral reads. reads were aligned with STAR [23] against human, bacterial, bovine, and canine genomes. study was performed at the university of Zurich, Switzerland. 83.8% of asked individuals consented. patients listed for lung transplantation and patients with prior lung transplant have been asked for participation in the study. routine immunosuppression included basiliximab (20 mg on day of surgery and post-operative day 4) and methylprednisolone (1 g given during operative procedure, 125 mg on postoperative day 1 and 2). maintenance immunosuppression included mycophenolate mofetil, prednisone and a calcineurin inhibitor, primarily cyclosporine. CMV and EBV were tested in blood samples using specific PCR [18, 19]. Routine cultures for bacteria and fungi were performed for all samples sent to the microbiology laboratory. both workflows were pooled in equal amounts for library construction with NexteraXT. reads were quality-filtered and cleaned from non-viral reads by aligning with STAR [23] against human, bacterial, bovine, and canine genomes. PCR Rhinovirus, TTV and HHV-7 were detected with specific real-time PCR as described [27\u201329] for TTV and HHV-7, copies/l were calculated using plasmid-based standards. 71 lung transplant recipients participated in this study. baseline enrollment 29 (40.9%) Indication enrollment 42 (59.1%) aChronic obstructive pulmonary disease Fig 1.

Overview of visits of lung transplant cohort. no symptoms in green, airway infection in red, diarrhea in yellow, fever in blue, other symptoms (including dyspnea and decrease in FEV1) in purple, death of the patient in black. the resulting contigs were genotyped as expected to the corresponding human rhinovirus A and B. for all four cases of rhinovirus detection, between 2 and 11 contigs were assembled that were genotyped as expected to the corresponding human rhinovirus A and B. the most frequently recorded reference sequence reported by the pipeline was used to analyze the genome coverage. the most frequently recorded reads were distributed over several locations of the genome, giving confidence that the reads originate from sequencing a full-length virus. human rhinovirus A21 strain ATCC VR-1131 (FJ445161.1) for gkc048, Human rhinovirus A46 (DQ473506.1) for lpt371, human coronavirus HKU1 strain N5P8 (DQ339101.1) for fyc360. all five patients were previously checked by multiplex PCR for the presence of respiratory viruses during routine testing but were diagnosed as negative. rhinovirus could not be detected by PCR in patient nrk011 (09/14) (44 reads detected, Table 2). Frequent detection of non-respiratory viruses and bacteriophages. reads for human herpes virus 7 (HHV-7) in 18 and Torque teno virus (TTV) in 9 of the 29 samples, respectively. we measured TTV and HHV-7 levels in all available throat swabs and blood samples of the study participants. HHV-7 was only detected in throat swabs and could not be detected in blood, suggesting a localized reactivation of HHV-7. we did not see a difference in TTV and HHV-7 virus loads between symptomatic visits and symptom-free visits. HHV-7 virus loads increased under immunosuppressive therapy in the early post transplantation phase. patients with baseline enrollment are grouped into those that never developed symptoms and those that developed at least one symptom (airway infection or dyspnea or decrease in FEV1) during the first 15 months after transplantation. metagenomic analysis detected viral pathogens in samples in which the prior routine multiplex PCR test was negative, the later confirmatory simplex PCR though positive. this was likely due to a low specificity of the PCR for the given virus strains which can occur particularly with multiplex assays. a drawback of metagenomic analysis remains its relatively low sensitivity compared to specific simplex PCR. a reliable metagenomics analysis must provide convincing evidence that the identified virus reads indeed indicate presence of the postulated viruses. the number of virus-specific reads, the depth of the coverage and the percent or locations of the genome covered are main parts of this information. no appropriate thresholds have been established in literature so far. the virus genome covered at several different locations provided plausible indication that the detected reads indeed indicated the presence of the postulated viruses. a careful evaluation and confirmation is necessary before treatment decisions can be solely based on NGS findings."}
