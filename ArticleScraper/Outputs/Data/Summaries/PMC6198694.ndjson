{"summary": "Hantavirus infections in humans present as two distinct clinical forms: hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus pulmonary syndrome (HPS) recent studies have also reported the emergence of Hantaviruses in india. urea was 18.7 mg/dL (n = 16.6\u201348.5), creatinine: 0.81 mg/dL (n = 0.7\u20131.2), aspartate aminotransferase: 21 U/L (n = 0\u201341), aspartate aminotransferase: 39 U/L (n = 0-40), aspartate aminotransferase: 375 U/L (n = 0\u2013308), and C-reactive protein: 59.5 there was no pulmonary embolism, however, bilateral extensive infiltrations and bilateral pleural effusion were detected. clinical exacerbation was thought to be related to impaired pulmonary ventilation due to infective process. line IgM test is reported to be 91.4% for IgM and 84.5% for IgG. the specificity 86% for IgM and 95.1% for IgG by the manufacturer. hantavirus infection is characterized by interstitial edema and alveolar disease with central or bibasilar involvement. the absence of prominent renal involvement offers a challenge to the clinician to make the diagnosis."}
