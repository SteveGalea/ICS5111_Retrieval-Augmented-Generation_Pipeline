{"summary": "access to decentralized molecular diagnostic testing can enable faster diagnostics, treatments, and subsequent control of infectious diseases. a large segment of the population in need of these advances resides in low-resource settings that offer extremely limited laboratory infrastructure [3, 4]. thermos thermal cycler (TTC) uses a very simple design that performs PCR amplification based on the \u201carchaic\u201d method of hand-transferring reaction tubes through a series of water baths. the automation of the PCR reactions by an Arduino microcontroller is performed so that the PCR tubes are mechanically transferred by the actions of servomotors in order to carry out PCR steps. de-identified clinical urine specimens were collected from patients who signed a written consent form from an earlier IRB approved study. original written consent forms were stored in a binder in a locked filing cabinet with access provided to study team coordinator only. both the consent process and study protocol were written in accordance with approved guidelines set forth by Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and Institutional Review Board protocols. thermal cycles need 10 to 12 s to switch between 95 and 60\u00b0C. commercial thermal-block-based PCR runs were performed in a CFX96 Touch real-time thermal cycler (Bio-Rad) and SimpliAmp thermal cycler (Life Technologies) target (PCR amplicon sizes) PCR components Human KCNE1 (45 bp) 10 L 2x PrimeSTAR Max mix or iTaq Universal SYBR PCR mix 1 L For primer (5\u2019 CCC ATT CAA CGT CTA CAT CGA GTC 3\u2019) 1 L Rev primer (5\u2019 TCC TTC TCT TGC CAG GCA T 3\u2019) 2 L SpeedSTAR HS polymerase 4 L nuclease-free water 2 L template Total GGC TAC ACT AGA AGA AAT GAT GAC AGC AT 3\u2019) 1 L Rev primer (5\u2019 GCT CAT TGC TTC AGC CAA AAC TCT TGC 3\u2019) 0.5 L Probe (5\u2019 AGT AGG AGG ACC CGG CCA TA 3\u2019) 2.5 L nuclease-free water 4 L template Total volume 25 L Gel electrophoresis analysis After amplification by the TTC or the commercial unit, the PCR the resulting gel images were captured using a cell phone camera. the typical ladder sizes used in the gel were 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 800, and 1500 bp. a 45-bp fragment of the single-copy gene KCNE1 was amplified from human genomic DNA by the TTC. commercial PCR reactions were performed with the following conditions: 5 min of hot-start at 95\u00b0C, followed by 35 cycles of 95\u00b0C (30 s), 65\u00b0C (30 s), and 72\u00b0C (45 s). the total run time was 84 min. eight TTC-based reactions were performed simultaneously using three water baths. the first water bath was for denaturation, while the second water bath was for denaturation. the PCR amplicon (165 bp) was checked with gel electrophoresis. the progress of the real-time PCR using the TTC can also be monitored by using blue LEDs for dye excitation and digital or cellphone camera. cDNA was amplified with 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C (5 s) and 60\u00b0C (15 s) this 300s/30s/45x reaction took 45 min to complete. the shortest protocol we tried was 300s/30s/45x(5s/10s) RNA from recombinant virus (AccuPlex rEbola GP/NP, SeraCare) was obtained for RT-PCR. the synthetic constructs were designed targeting the glycoprotein gene (GP), nucleoprotein gene (NP) and VP24 of Ebola Zaire isolate. the capped RNA was introduced into baby hamster kidney cells. new test will help diagnose dengue within the first 7 days after symptoms of the illness appear. RNA samples were amplified by a commercial cycler and the TTC. commercial RT-PCR condition is listed in Table 1. polypropylene plastic tubes are commonly used in most commercial thermal cycles. but they are not ideal for achieving a fast PCR reaction time because of the slow heat transfer between the plastic and the heating element. a room-temperature bath (RTB) lowered the temperature of the reagents inside the PCR tubes from 90\u00b0C to just above 60\u00b0C in 2.5 s. primer concentrations were 10 M and were diluted to a final concentration of 500 nM after the master mixes were prepared. the sample volume for glass capillary tubes was 17 L. 0.5 L Probe (5\u2019 AGA ATC TTT CGC AAT GGA CG 3\u2019) 5.5 L nuclease-free water 2 L template Total volume 20 L HIV gag (85 bp) 10 L 2x One Step RT-PCR buffer III 0.5 L PrimeScript RT enzyme mix II 0.5 LTakara Ex Taq HS 1 L For primer (5\u2019 GGC TAC ACT AGA AGA AAT GAT GAC AGC AT 3\u2019) 1 L the resulting gel images were captured using a cell phone camera. the typical ladder sizes used in the gel were 50, 100, 150, 200, 300, 500, 800, and 1500 bp. commercially available multiplexed PCR kit (Isohelix DQC Kit) was purchased. the positive control human DNA template was used in PCR reactions. eight TTC-based reactions were performed simultaneously using three water baths. eluted DNA templates were prepared in premix ex Taq (Probe qPCR) polymerase master mix (Takara/Clontech) and amplified in glass capillary tubes with a TaqMan hydrolysis probe assay. commercial PCR reactions were performed with the following conditions: 30 s of hot-start at 95\u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C (5 s) and 60\u00b0C (15 s). this took 43 min to complete 40 cycles. qRT-PCR used a superscript III Platinum One-Step Quantitative RT-PCR system. a commercial thermal cycler was used to perform real-time RT-PCR. the cDNA was amplified with 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C (5 s) and 60\u00b0C (15 s) RNA from recombinant Ebola virus (AccuPlex rEbola GP/NP, SeraCare) was obtained for RT-PCR by the TTC. the capped RNA was introduced into baby hamster kidney cells. the recombinant virus was cultured and purified, heat-inactivated, and then diluted into defibrinated human plasma. the CDC has recently developed a new diagnostic test, \"CDC DENV-1-4 Real Time RT PCR Assay,\" for the detection and serotype identification of dengue. this is the first FDA-approved molecular test for dengue that detects evidence of the virus itself. this new test will help diagnose dengue within the first 7 days after symptoms of the illness appear. gel electrophoresis shown in Fig 2b confirms that the correct amplicons were produced with both the 5.5- and 7.5-min protocols using glass capillary tubes. this results confirm that the performance of our TTC was very impressive in terms of the cost-to-build and the speed with which reaction can be achieved using the TTC. the 28-min reaction time needed by the TTC to perform 35 cycles is much shorter than the protocol performed with a commercial thermal cycler. Lane 1: ladder. Lanes 2 and 3: amplicons produced by the TTC using a 180s/35x(15s/2.5s/20s) protocol. commercial PCR reactions took 45 min to complete a 40-cycle reaction. Fig 4. PCR amplification of Chlamydia trachomatis DNA template. Lanes 7 to 10 contain the same samples as Lanes 2\u20135 but were only amplified for 35 PCR cycles (10.5 min) using a three-bath system and before optimizing the run protocol for speed, we amplify and detect recombinant Ebola RNA in glass capillary tubes in under 32 min. the gel data show that the amplification produced the correct product, and the yield is similar to commercial PCR runs. commercial PCR thermal cyclers showed that RT-PCR can be completed in about 84 min with a Cq of 35 in a 50-cycle reaction using the TTC. the denaturation bath dropped from 97.4\u00b0C to 92.7\u00b0C, while the annealing/extension bath dropped from 61.6\u00b0C to 59.2\u00b0C. the next two samples (Lanes 4 and 5) are amplicons from a 45-cycle TTC RT-PCR run using a protocol of 330s/10s/45x(15s/30s) the next two samples (Lanes 4 and 5) are amplicons from a 45-cycle RT-PCR run using a protocol of 330s/20s/45x(15s/30s) a 45-cycle reaction performed by the commercial cycler took 74 min. the PCR tubes that had undergone 45 cycles of RT-PCR were visualized using a cell phone camera. the top two tubes are HIV positive samples, while the bottom two tubes are the same mix that did not go through the RT-PCR process. the commercial RT-PCR used a protocol of 300s/10s/45x(8s/16s) which took 53 min to complete and had a Cq of 33.4. the commercial RT-PCR used a protocol of 300s/10s/45x(8s/16s) which took 53 min to complete and had a low template concentration (Cq of 33.4 from a commercial run) the fluorescence signal from the TTC and the commercial run was plotted against the reaction time. it is very clear that the TTC signal rose above the background signal much faster (1068 s, or 17.8 min, after RT started) than the commercial run. we also tested the TTC\u2019s water baths\u2019 ability to maintain temperature by placing them inside a refrigerator and in the cargo space of an SUV under a hot sun for 1 hr. when placed inside a hot SUV, the temperature of the denaturation and annealing/extension baths dropped only 3.5 and 1.0\u00b0C in 60 min. Fig 2a is an image of the glass capillary tubes after 30s/40x(4s/6s) PCR reactions (total run time of 7.5 min) the capillary tube on the left did not undergo PCR, while the two tubes on the right show reactions after TTC-PCR. it is clear that the fluorescent signal at the conclusion of PCR was higher due to the hydrolysis of the probes. the gel photo in Fig 3 shows that the TTC can produce multiplexed amplicons with the correct sizes. the yield is similar to a three-step reaction performed in the commercial cycler with same number of PCR cycles. the 28-min reaction time needed by the TTC to perform 35 cycles is much shorter than the protocol performed with a commercial thermal cycler. y tubes after each cycle can be recorded to monitor the progress of increasing green fluorescence in tubes with positive target template. commercial PCR reactions took 45 min to complete a 40-cycle reaction. commercial PCR reactions took 45 min to complete a 40-cycle reaction. polypropylene tubes can be used for reverse transcription, denaturation, annealing, and extension. annealing and extension steps can be combined, so users can perform reverse transcription in one thermos, followed by denaturation in another thermos, and then use a third thermos for annealing/extension. this helps speed up the reactions due to faster heat transfer. RT-PCR can be completed in about 84 min with a Cq of 35 in a 50-cycle reaction using the TTC. the two upper tubes contain target RNA, while the bottom two tubes are samples that did not go through the reactions. the denaturation bath dropped from 97.4\u00b0C to 92.7\u00b0C. annealing/extension bath dropped from 61.6\u00b0C to 59.2\u00b0C. the temperature drops were not severe enough that they affected PCR results severely. the protocol was reduced to 300s/10s/45x with a total run time of 16.4 min for a 45-cycle RT-PCR reaction. amplicons were still being produced, even though overall efficiency seems to have dropped slightly. a 45-cycle reaction performed by the commercial cycler took 74 min. dengue virus RNA amplification Next, we used the TTC to demonstrate possible dengue diagnostics by RT-PCR using the RNA extracted from inactivated dengue in human serum. similar to the amplification of RNA from HIV and recombinant Ebola virus, the TTC can carry out effective dengue RNA amplification in both plastic and glass capillary PCR tubes. gel electrophoresis data of a series of 300s/10s/45x(8s/16s) reactions showing the amplicons at cycle 0, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, and 45. it is clear that the amplicon gel band did not show up until the cycler number reached 35. it is very clear that the TTC signal rose above the background signal much faster (1068 s, or 17.8 min, after RT started) than the commercial run. the heat released by the near-boiling water quickly warms the air mass inside of the box. the temperature of the denaturation and annealing/extension baths dropped only 3.5 and 1.0\u00b0C in 60 min. the smaller temperature drop was expected due to the smaller thermal gradient between the water and the environment. we demonstrated that our innovative TTC can deliver high-speed and sensitive PCR and RT-PCR without any active temperature control during the reactions. a 6-s per cycle PCR is feasible without using high concentrations of PCR reagents to speed up the reactions, thus making it one of the fastest and most economical thermal cycling units reported in literature. this is a gif file showing the progress of real-time PCR in glass capillary tubes. the left tube has the highest template concentration (1X), the second tube has 1/10 diluted template, the third tube has 1/1000 diluted template."}
