{"summary": "the financial burden to healthcare systems is also alarming. a decade ago the annual economic cost of nosocomial infection in the us was determined to be in the region of $6.7 billion [1]. the cost of implementing strategies to prevent nosocomial infection is likely much less than the value of resources consumed in treatment of these infections once they occur. the mainstay employed in controlling hospital infection is cleansing using biocides (antiseptics and disinfectants), such as quaternary ammonium compounds (QACs), halogen-releasing agents, and phenolics. there is also concern that intensive exposure of nosocomial pathogens to biocides may allow for the selection of biocide resistant/tolerant bacterial strains [8]\u2013[12]. photosensitizers have been used clinically in photodynamic therapy of malignancies [25]\u2013[27] and have potential application in photodynamic antimicrobial chemotherapy (PACT) of malignancies. photosensitizers are capable of reacting in the presence of visible light to produce cytotoxic effects. biofilm provides an environment where antimicrobial penetration is hindered, genetic exchange and resistance transfer are facilitated, and a change in physiological state are a significant factor in the resistance to anti photodynamic, infection-resistant material may find broad application as coatings or covers for various inanimate objects commonly found in a hospital environment. photodynamic, infection-resistant material may find broad application as coatings or covers for various inanimate objects commonly found in a hospital environment such as handrails, high-tech medical equipment. materials and Methods Materials High-density poly(ethylene) (LDPE) was obtained from Q-Chem Ltd, Doha, Qatar (Marlex HHM TR-144, BN. 11100464) cationic 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis(1-methyl-4-pyridinio)porphyrin tetra(p-toluenesulfonate) >97% (TMPyP) was obtained from TriPor the extruder was pre-heated to 230\u00b0C along the screw and at the die. pure HDPE was extruded initially in order to ensure the correct conditions had been obtained. the chill roll was maintained at 110\u00b0C and roller speed was 1.2 metres per minute. all images captured were 20482048 pixels, with a line average of 16. the microscope pinhole was set at a 5.89 airy (600 m) diameter. reflectance images were recorded by setting the excitation beam wavelength to 488 nm and detecting emission in the range 480\u2013500 nm. the dimensions of the narrow portion of the dumb-bell (width and thickness) were measured using a digital micrometer. the samples were secured between the mobile upper and lower clamps of the texture analyzer. the upper clamp was raised at a speed of 50 mm.min1 until sample fracture occurred. photosensitizer-incorporated samples (7550 mm) were cut and wiped 50 times with a medical wipe moistened in a 1% (w/v) solution of non-ionic surfactant, Tween 20, as a model for typical hospital surface cleaning products. drops of bacterial inoculum (60 L \u2013 approx. 1.6104 cfu/cm2) were placed into a sterile petri dish. each drop was covered with a single sensitizer-loaded or control sample. samples were removed from dishes and placed in 10 mL PBS. materials High-density poly(ethylene) (LDPE) was obtained from Q-Chem Ltd, Doha, Qatar. cationic 5,10,15,20-Tetrakis (1-methyl-4-pyridinio)porphyrin tetra(p-toluenesulfonate) >97% (TMPyP) was obtained from TriPorTech GmbH, L\u00fcbeck, Germany. the required weights of HDPE and sensitizer were mixed together. the extruder was pre-heated to 230\u00b0C along the screw and at the die. the chill roll was maintained at 110\u00b0C and roller speed was 1.2 metres per minute. confocal laser scanning microscopy was performed using a leica DM RE upright microscope in conjunction with a Leica TCS SP2 system. all images captured were 20482048 pixels, with a line average of 16 and were the average of 16 individual scans. the microscope pinhole was set at a 5.89 airy (600 m) diameter. the measurements of the narrow portion of the dumb-bell were measured using a digital micrometer. in order to test the sample, the upper clamp was raised at a speed of 50 mm.min1 until sample fracture occurred. photosensitizer-incorporated samples were cut and wiped 50 times with a medical wipe moistened in a 1% (w/v) solution of non-ionic surfactant, Tween 20, as a model for typical hospital surface cleaning products. drops of bacterial inoculum (60 L \u2013 approx. 1.6104 cfu/cm2) were placed into a sterile petri dish. each drop was covered with a single sensitizer-loaded or control sample. samples were sonicated for 10 minutes in order to remove adherent bacteria. a two-tailed student\u2019s t-test was carried out using a two-tailed student\u2019s t-test, p0.05. Statistical significance was determined against dark HDPE control. optical microscope images of (A) PE, (B) 0.05% MB-PE, (C) 0.40% MB-PE, (D) 0.05% MB-PE, (D) 0.05% TBO-PE, and (E) 0.40% TMPyP-HDPE revealed incomplete mixing of the photosensitizer with the material, at both the 0.05% and 0.40% concentrations. phenothiazine incorporated films, the transmittance of low concentration materials (0.05% TBO and MB) was approximately 46% and 44%, respectively. samples containing 0.40% MB exhibited transmittance of 28%. 0.40% TBO reduced transmittance to 14%. incorporation of TMPyP at concentrations of 0.05% causes a statistically significant reduction in the yield strength of the material. TBO at either concentration causes a significant reduction on the yield strength of PE (31.11.47 MPa vs. 27.92.27 (0.05%) and 27.81.94 (0.40%) addition of 0.05% TMPyP produces no significant change in the Young\u2019s modulus from that of PE (66545 MPa (PE) vs. 61910 (0.05%) and 63742 (0.40%) however inclusion of 0.05% TMPyP in PE sheets results in significant reduction in Young\u2019s modulus (57613 MPa) use of TBO produces significant increases in elongation, with increasing concentration, from that of PE (56348% vs. 75642 (0.05%) and 84047% (0.40%) leaching behaviour Touch testing was performed on samples containing TPP, TMPyP, TBO, and MB. RSA were taken forward to testing against Gram-negative E.coli. Gram-negative bacteria are widely considered to be more tolerant to photoinactivation than their Gram-positive counterparts [29], [36]. HDPE containing 0.4% TMPyP showed excellent anti-bacterial and anti-adherent characteristics, with no viable organisms detected after light irradiation. MB 0.4% and TBO 0.4% did not perform as favourably, resulting in a 0.75 and a 0.47 log-cycle reduction in adherence. 0.40% and 0.05% TPP loading, an even fluorescence signal was observed on the surfaces of the samples. however, fluorescence imaging of the surface of TMPyP incorporated HDPE revealed incomplete mixing of the photosensitizer with the material, at both the 0.05% and 0.40% concentrations. the transmittance of low concentration porphyrin-incorporated materials (0.05% TPP and TMPyP) was approximately 49%. samples containing 0.4% TMPyP exhibited transmittance of 37%. 0.4% TPP reduced transmittance to 33%. incorporation of MB at either concentration causes no significant effect on yield strength of PE. TBO at either concentration causes a statistically significant reduction in yield strength of PE. in a similar manner, the presence of a 0.05% loading of TBO results in a significant reduction in ultimate tensile strength. adding of TPP produces no significant change in the Young\u2019s modulus from that of PE (66545 MPa (PE) vs. 61910 (0.05%) and 63742 (0.40%) 0.05% TMPyP results in no significant changes in elongation (81646%) use of TBO produces significant increases in elongation, with increasing concentration from that of PE (56348% vs. 75642 (0.05%) and 84047% (0.40%) log CFU/cm2 adhered bacteria were enumerated on control materials (HDPE without photosensitizer), and test samples in both dark and light-irradiated conditions. only lead materials that showed good antibacterial activity against Gram-positive MRSA were taken forward to testing against Gram-negative E.coli. HDPE containing TPP 0.4% showed the least anti-microbial activity. MB 0.4%, TBO 0.4% and TMPyP 0.4% showed a 1.39, 2.30, and 3.62 log-cycle reduction against MRSA adherence. MB 0.4% and TBO 0.4% did not perform as favourably. sion process was successful in incorporating photosensitizer into HDPE films. homogeneity of photosensitizer distribution appears to vary depending on the film used. other sensitizers used, TMPyP, TBO and MB, all show some evidence of photosensitizer aggregation and incomplete mixing. antimicrobial testing showed that the most effective photosensitizer for incorporating into antimicrobial HDPE films was TMPyP at the high concentration of 0.40%. this material displayed a 3.61 log-cycle reduction in viable MRSA, and 1.51 log-cycle reduction in E. coli after two hours light irradiation at 1340 W/cm2 per sample. the halogen bulb light source is inexpensive and representative of lighting conditions found in typical artificially-illuminated indoor environments. specialized lighting could be installed to emit at higher intensity, and at a wavelength specific for the excitation of the photosensitizer employed, for efficient generation of ROS and the resulting bactericidal effects. this study builds upon previous work in the development of photo-activated, antimicrobial polymers for the prevention of medical device associated infection. the cotton-based fabrics documented in their study showed up to 5 log-cycle reductions in viable S. aureus, but only an approximate 1 log-cycle reduction in E.coli [39]. these figures are comparable to those obtained in our present work."}
