{"summary": "four influenza virus pandemics have occurred in humans, resulting in widespread disease and severe loss of life. the 1918 Spanish influenza virus (H1N1; estimated 50 million deaths), 1957 Asian influenza virus (H2N2; estimated 2 million deaths), 1968 Hong Kong influenza virus (H3N2; estimated 1 million deaths), and most recently the 2009 swine-derived H1N1 influenza virus (H3N2; estimated 1 million deaths) studies in these models have yielded important discoveries about viral pathogenicity determinants and key host response events contributing to pathogenic mechanisms. however, the available data do not permit a complete understanding of the course of viral pneumonia, from the initial exposure phase through recovery. two animals per time point were euthanized under anesthesia and necropsies were performed. the remaining macaque (mock infected) was inoculated with 4 ml of PBS intratracheally and euthanized at 6 h p.i. tissue samples were thawed, weighed, and homogenized in 1 ml PBS. resulting homogenates were centrifuged at 2,000 rpm for 10 min. then serial dilutions of suspensions were inoculated into 10-day-old embryonated chicken eggs for virus titration. cDNA was generated for equal amounts of total RNA from infected macaque lungs using the QuantiTect reverse transcription (RT) kit. levels of hemagglutinin subtype 5 (H5 HA) and matrix (M) gene viral RNAs were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR. primary gene expression data are available at http://viromics.washington.edu. correlated temporal gene expression patterns were identified from differentially expressed genes. gene clusters were further analyzed for representative functions using gene ontology. all experiments using the virus were performed in a biosafety level 3+ containment laboratory approved by the Chinese Ministry of Agriculture. all animal studies were approved by the Review Board of Harbin Veterinary Research Institute, the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences. a, brain (cerebellum, cerebrum, and brain stems were collected separately) tonsils, liver, spleen, kidneys, heart, and colon were either stored at 80\u00b0C for virus titration. tissue samples were thawed, weighed, and homogenized in 1 ml PBS (containing 1,000 units/ml penicillin and 1,000 g/ml str. cDNA was generated for equal amounts of total RNA from infected macaque lungs. cDNA was generated for equal amounts of total RNA from infected macaque lungs. cDNA was generated for equal amounts of total RNA from infected lungs. tinin subtype 5 (H5 HA) and matrix (M) gene viral RNAs were determined by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase PCR (qPCR) using an ABI 7500 PCR system and TaqMan chemistry. differences in gene expression were represented as log10 relative quantity (RQ), relative to a calibrator and normalized to a reference. gene expression patterns were identified from differentially expressed genes by hierarchical clustering according to Eisen's method (14). gene clusters were further analyzed for representative functions using Gene Ontology (GO) and required a P value of 0.01 for identification of significant molecular function (MF), biological process (BP) or cellular component (CC) GO annotations. RESULTS Rhesus macaques infected with influenza A/Anhui/2/2005 (H5N1) display symptoms consistent with sublethal viral pneumonia. TB measured 24 h before the start of the experiment revealed a range of values among the macaque cohort. however, infected animals exhibited a uniform spike in TB (i.e., fever) at 1 to 2 days p.i., a subsequent retraction in TB, and a hematological analyses indicated early (2-day) and late (12-day) peripheral granulocytosis. serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assays indicated the production of influenza virus-specific antibodies by day 12. most macaques infected with anhui/2 exhibited some loss of appetite and/or reduced mental status through day 6 p.i. replication was efficient both in the upper respiratory tract (trachea and bronchus) and in all lobes of the lung, and virus titers peaked from 12 to 24 h p.i. no virus could be detected at any time points in any other tissues except for tonsils. 4.8 4.05 1.98 1.5 4.5 4.5 6 6.5 3 days M8 2.5 4.63 5.55 2.46 3.23 5.3 3.8 4.8 M9 2.98 2.98 1.28 3.8 1.5 4.3 6 days M7 4.05 2.98 2.98 2.8 4.8 3.98 2.28 M10 3.98 4.05 3.73 4.05 2.8 3.55 3.55 3.55 3.55 3.55 14 days M11 M12 a M0 was a mock-infected animal. comprehensive pathological evaluation of anhui/2-induced pneumonia in rhesus macaques. macaque lungs were examined at both the gross level and microscopically using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical detection of influenza virus antigens. despite the lack of gross pneumonic lesions at 6 h p.i., we observed minor biological reactions at the microscopic level. we also observed eosinophilic bronchitis and perivascular infiltration of eosinophils. prominent detection of viral antigens in multiple cell types between 12 and 24 h p.i. indicates efficient early viral replication. significant gross pneumonic lesions were observed, roughly more proximal than distal to the trachea and bronchi. scant viral antigens persisted only in alveolar type I pneumocytes. mitotic epithelial cells were frequently observed, and peribronchial lymph follicles were enlarged. rhesus macaques exposed to anhui/2 were actively infected and showed progressive pneumonia until 3 days p.i. rhesus macaque lung was first infected at 6 h p.i. (1,894 genes), peaked at 3 days p.i. (5,235 genes), and exhibited a reduction at the remaining time points. differentially expressed genes were first observed at 6 h p.i. (1,894 genes), and exhibited a reduction at the remaining time points. we detected 16 unique clusters, and the function of each cluster was interrogated by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis. the average gene expression pattern for each cluster is shown in Fig. 4 along with representative GO annotations. several wave pattern clusters showed strong reactions at 12 h p.i. (2, 8, 9, and 10) all except for cluster 8 were upregulated. cluster 9 exhibited upregulation that peaked at 12 h p.i. chemokine involved in recruitment of monocyte/macrophages and lymphocytes. PPBP and PF4 (in cluster 9) have potent chemoattractant activity directed toward neutrophils. this is consistent with abundant viral replication in the lung at 12 to 24 h. abundant, late expression of mitosis-related genes points toward a mitotic T lymphocyte population in the alveolus during the late stage of infection. this cluster was enriched for antigen processing and presentation, consistent with host recovery from disease at this time point. inflammatory molecules tended to be upregulated in a biphasic pattern (at 1 to 2 days and at 6 days) by day 14 p.i., cytokines and chemokines in both lung and peripheral blood were mostly below the limit of detection. four lung tissue samples from same mock-infected control macaque were homogenized in PBS. resultsant supernatants containing equal protein concentrations were subjected to the bead array assay. cytokine/chemokine concentrations for individual macaques are indicated by differentially shaded gray bars at each time point. a prominent increase in expression of a neutrophil-specific marker (FCGR3B) (8) in parallel. FCGR3B increased in expression at 12 h and 1 day, peaked in expression on day 3. these data firmly suggest that neutrophils are abundant first responders during Anhui/2 infection of the lung. cytotoxic (CD8) and regulatory (CD25) T cells consistently showed an initial peak at day 1 p.i. followed by a second more prominent peak on day 6. it is conceivable that the decrease in expression of T cell markers on day 3 is a result of dilution due to prominent increases in neutrophil and macrophage populations. however, increased T cell marker expression directly coincides with lymphopenia. PTGS2/COX2, TNF, IFNG, IL1A, and IL1B all exhibited upregulation at the mRNA level by 12 h p.i. PTGS2/COX2, TNF, IFNG, and IFNG all exhibited upregulation at the protein level by 12 to 24 h in lung. systemically all three exhibited a protein-level peak at 2 days. rhesus macaques infected with influenza A/Anhui/2/2005 (H5N1) display symptoms consistent with sublethal viral pneumonia. TB measured 24 h before the start of the experiment revealed a range of values among the macaque cohort. however, infected animals exhibited a uniform spike in TB (i.e., fever) at 1 to 2 days p.i., a subsequent retraction in TB, and a second fever at lymphopenia has been observed in cynomolgus macaques infected with influenza virus (2). hematological analyses indicated early (2-day) and late (12-day) peripheral granulocytosis and increased platelet numbers. serum neutralization and hemagglutination inhibition assays indicated the production of influenza virus-specific antibodies by day 12. serum from two macaques (no. M11 and M12) was assayed for hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer (HI) and neutralization antibody titer (NT) titers were isolated from respiratory tissues (i.e., trachea, bronchus, and lung) from 6 h through 6 days p.i. the highest viral load was carried in the lungs. influenza virus infection predisposes infected individuals to bacterial superinfection by multiple species (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus species) this can cause combined viral/bacterial pneumonia or postviral pneumonia (47). macaque lungs were examined at both the gross level and microscopically using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and immunohistochemical detection of influenza virus antigens. at 6 h (A), 12 h (B), 1 day (C), 3 days (D), 6 days (E) and 14 days (F) p.i., macaque lungs were examined at both the gross level and microscopically. in panels Cii and Dii, the inset shows viral antigen staining in alveolus. a graphical summary of pathological observations is shown in panel iii. despite the lack of gross pneumonic lesions at 6 h p.i., we observed minor biological reactions. by 24 h p.i., the inflammatory reaction increased. antigen-positive cells were present in bronchiole-alveolar junctions. viral antigen was detected in both type II and type I pneumocytes. rhesus macaques exposed to anhui/2 were actively infected and showed progressive pneumonia until 3 days p.i. some consolidation was apparent in the peribronchiolar alveolus (Fig. 3Eii) scant viral antigens persisted only in alveolar type I pneumocytes. anhui/2-induced pneumonia began to regress, concurrent with diminished viral replication and the appearance of some signs of immune response resolution. by day 6 postinfection, anhui/2-infected pneumonia began to regress, concurrent with diminished viral replication. by 14 days p.i., some immune cells were retained in the infected regions. hierarchical clustering was used to identify groups of differentially expressed genes exhibiting similar global expression profiles (referred to as \u201cwave patterns\u201d). the average gene expression pattern for each cluster is shown in Fig. 4 along with representative GO annotations. four wave pattern clusters (4, 11, 15, and 16) showed increased gene expression at 6 h p.i. GO analysis revealed enriched annotations for cytokine receptor activity (e.g., IL1R1, IL1R2, IL7R, IL6ST, IL8RA, IL8RB) and a few cytokines and antiviral molecules (e.g., IL28A/B, interleukin 29 [IL-29], clusters 2 and 3, both exhibiting sustained upregulation starting from 12 to 24 h, contained additional cytokine genes and a signature for GO processes related to antiviral signaling functions (e.g., STAT2, TLR3, MYD88, DDX58, and ZC3HAV1/ZAP) and apoptosis (e.g., STAT2, TLR3, MYD88, DDX58, and ZC3HAV1/ZAP) cluster 1 was heavily enriched for GO annotations related to mitosis. GO annotations were limited among genes that exhibited upregulation primarily at day 14 p.i. (cluster 14) but this cluster was enriched for antigen processing and presentation. IL1B, IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1/CCL2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) exhibited the earliest consistent upregulation in the lung. inflammatory molecules tended to be upregulated in a biphasic pattern (at 1 to 2 days and at 6 days) cytokine/chemokine concentrations (pg/ml) for individual macaques are indicated by differentially shaded gray bars at each time point. recruitment of specific immune cell subtypes during anhui/2-induced pneumonia was estimated by expression levels of cell type-specific transcripts in the lung. a prominent increase in the expression of a neutrophil-specific marker (FCGR3B) (8) in parallel. the upregulation of both PF4 and PPBP (neutrophil chemoattractants) at the same time point, we observed a prominent increase in the expression of a neutrophil-specific marker (FCGR3B) T lymphocyte markers showed a biphasic pattern of expression, suggesting biphasic recruitment to the lung in response to anhui/2 infection. a general marker for multiple T lymphocyte populations (CD3) consistently showed an initial peak at day 1 p.i., followed by a second more prominent peak on day 6. PTGS2/COX2, TNF, IFNG, IL1A, and IL1B all exhibited upregulation at the mRNA level by 12 h p.i.. PTGS2/COX2, TNF, IFNG, IL1A, and IL1B all exhibited upregulation at the protein level by 12 to 24 h in lung. IFNG mRNA and protein expression exhibited a second peak on day 6 in lungs. it seems likely that the second peak is largely regulated by IFNG and/or other factors (e.g., TNF or IL-6) anhui/2 virus targeted cells deep within the lungs, causing pneumonia with marked exudation of proteinaceous edema fluid and severe alveolar damage. however, the number of infected cells decreased over time, inflammation eventually receded, and all animals recovered from acute pneumonia. transcriptional analyses also revealed upregulation of neutrophil-attracting chemokines (e.g., PF4/CXCL4 and PPBP/CXCL7) as early as 6 h after influenza virus exposure. PF4 and PPBP are highly transcriptionally upregulated in human bronchial epithelial cells infected with an HPAI H5N1 virus. this is the first study to replicate pneumonia-associated biphasic fevers in an animal model of influenza virus infection. a more specific understanding of the mechanisms regulating this disease process is essential in the strategy for controlling human mortality associated with pandemic viruses."}
