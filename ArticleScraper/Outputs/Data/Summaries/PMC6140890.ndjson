{"summary": "the two most frequent diseases are diarrhea and respiratory disease. umbilical infection is the third most common disease during the first few months of life. the economic losses resulting from calf diseases may also include increased mortality. a network of 75 Charolais herds recruited from the regions of Burgundy and Vend\u00e9e. the breeders recorded data on herd performance and transmitted it to the French Charolais breeding society during two successive birth campaigns, from august 2013 to July 2015. all 16 herds were managed according to a standard suckler herd production system. in which calves were reared by their dams until 6 to 8 mo of age. the animals were indoors between late November and April and pastured outside. breeder was asked to record the date of occurrence, the suspected disease, and the treatment administered to the calf. to be considered as a health event, treatment was not preventive but only given in response to calf illness. the first 4 h after birth with a score ranging from 1 (very vigorous calf standing, walking and reaching for the udder within the first hour after birth) and 3 (weak calf needing more than 4 h to reach the udder) survival was defined as a binary trait (0 = dead; 1 = alive), based on whether the calf was still alive at 30 d of age. the frequency of navel illness between 21 and 30 d of age (Umb3) was too low to estimate genetic parameters. the incidence risk of diseases was calculated as the number of calves treated for the first time for a disease before 1 mo of age divided by the number of calves eligible for treatment. y = X b + Z u + Q m + W c + e where y is the vector of observations, b is a vector of fixed effects, and u, m, c, and e are random vectors representing direct genetic breeding value, maternal genetic breeding value, common maternal environmental effects. sex effect was significant with respect to calf BW, CE, NV, umbilical infection and survival at 30 d. classes 6, 7, and 8 corresponded to third parity cows aged 4, 5, and 6 yr. classes 9, 10, and 11 corresponded to fourth and more parity cows aged 5, 6, and more than 6 yr old. analysis was performed using a BLUP multitrait animal model. the breeders recorded data on herd performance and transmitted it to the French Charolais breeding society during two successive birth campaigns. data on the 30-d survival of all single newborn calves were extracted from the french national database which is used for on-farm genetic evaluations. the final research dataset included data on 2,740 calves produced by 2,044 dams and 252 sires in 16 connected herds.

(2011) estimated the heritability of umbilical (14%) and respiratory (9%) diseases in a large-scale study of german Holstein calves monitored from birth to 2 mo of age. our results revealed the importance of accurately describing both diarrhea and umbilical infections (in terms of age ranges) and accounting for both maternal genetic and environmental effects. phenotypic trends previously observed in Brahman (Riley et al., 2004) and Holstein (Barrier et al., 2012) calves. however, this trend could only be due to environmental factors. we also estimated correlation values between direct genetic effects and between environmental (both common maternal and residual) effects for CE and CE. the correlation between maternal genetic effects involved in early (Umb1) and later (Umb2) umbilical infections was clearly negative (0.68), indicating that maternal genetics may have opposing effects on disease resistance in the two age ranges. future studies should also examine the correlation between the direct genetic effects for Umb1 and maternal genetic effects for Umb2. calving management and feeding, calf immunity, herd size, and environmental stress or contamination are the most important enteropathogens associated with diarrhea in calves younger than 1 mo. genetic resistance to diarrhea at early, intermediate and later ages seems to be moderately, but favorably, correlated, selective breeding may constitute an effective means of preventing some diarrhea outbreaks. selection on both maternal and direct genetic resistance to early umbilical infection (Umb1) could potentially improve resistance to early umbilical infection and early and late diarrhea. the only exception to this was the maternal genetic correlation between BW and Diar1, which tended towards 1. conflicting results depend on the type of effects (direct genetic, maternal genetic, or common environmental) and the age range affected by the diarrhea outbreak. maternal genetic effects for Surv and NV were unfavorably linked to those improving resistance in any of the three diarrhea traits. lower direct genetic survival was not only associated with lower genetic susceptibility to Diar2 but also, to a lesser extent, with lower genetic susceptibility to Umb1. maternal genetic effects that improved calf survival were unfavorably linked to the maternal genetic effects involved in any disease resistance traits. calving events not requiring assistance were 11 points below the rate of 68% observed at a national scale. the proportion of caesarians was close to the national average (4%). no health events were recorded for 1,947 of the 2,740 calves in the analyzed dataset. the frequency of umbilical infections between 21 and 30 d of age (Umb3) was too low to estimate genetic parameters. this was also the case for other diseases (including respiratory diseases) recorded in the 2 yr of data. cryptosporidiosis is one of the major causes worldwide of moderate-to-severe diarrhea in both humans and livestock. no drug therapy is yet available and the high resistance of oocysts to a range of environmental conditions and chemical treatments make cryptosporidiosis difficult to control.
