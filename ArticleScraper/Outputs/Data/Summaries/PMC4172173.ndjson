{"summary": "some anticancer drugs are gonadotoxic, with infertility becoming a major concern for women undergoing cancer treatments. the key basis for the adverse effects on the ovary is the limited supply of oocytes contained within the ovarian follicles, which are formed before birth. the reproductive lifespan of a woman ceases when the number of primordial follicles becomes too low (less than around a thousand), leading to the menopause. DOC plasma concentrations in patients are highly variable, with different regimens of 40 mg m2 administered weekly or 100 mg m2 administered every 3 weeks. the effects of DOC are particularly controversial, with other work showing that patients treated with taxanes restore normal menstrual cyclicity more frequently. drug-specific damage therefore needs to be characterized to define toxicity. so far this approach has been explored only by laboratory studies. thyroid hormones have been hypothesized to minimize the impact of taxanes on ovarian functionality. mice were housed in a 14 h light-10 h dark cycle, with food and beverage provided ad libitum. ovaries were dissected out and placed in pre-warmed leibovitz L-15 medium. ovaries were transferred into a 24-well plate (Grenier Bio-one, Stonehouse, UK) ovaries were cultured as above but exposed to 0.1% ethanol-vehicle (CONTROL), 107 M of T3 (T3), 0.1 M of DOC (LOW-DOC) or a combination of 107 M T3 and 0.1 M DOC (T3+LOW-DOC) the culture continued to the end of Day 6. serial sections (5 m thick) were collected and every sixth section stained with haematoxylin and eosin and photomicrographed. total number of follicles per ovary was estimated from counts of follicles with a visible germinal vesicle in the section. counts then corrected using the Abercrombie formula (Abercrombie, 1946) slides were microwaved in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH6; Fisher Chemical, Loughborough, UK) and blocked in 20% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Fisher Scientific UK Ltd, UK) slides were then incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit anti-CC3 and mouse anti-MVH (1:100; Abcam, UK) antibodies. endogenous peroxidase was blocked in 3% H2O2 and 10% methanol. then microwaved in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH6; Fisher Chemical, Loughborough, UK) and blocked in 20% normal goat serum in PBST, and 5% BSA. slides were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rabbit monoclonal antibody anti-CC8 (1:500; Cell Signalling Technology, USA) 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 2 and 3 were added to two ovaries, then homogenized and centrifuged. ovaries (n = 20), after freezing, underwent a process for the separation of mitochondria and cytosol components (Mitochondria Isolation kit for cultured cells, Thermo Scientific, Rockford, USA) normal distribution was assessed using a non-parametric test of distribution. one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests were applied to normally distributed data. Kruskal\u2013Wallis followed by Dunn post hoc tests were applied to data not normally distributed. doses of DOC were chosen to cover the range of concentrations found in the plasma of patients undergoing cancer treatments. on day 3, all ovaries were transferred into fresh control medium. half of the medium was replaced on Day 5 with the culture continued to the end of Day 6. ovaries in the T3 and T3+LOW-DOC groups were also exposed to T3 during Days 3\u20135, but not to DOC after Day 2. ovaries were fixed in Bouin's fluid and embedded in paraffin wax. IHC for cleaved caspase 3 (CC3) and mouse vasa homologue (MVH) used fluorescent secondary antibodies. IHC for cleaved caspase 8 (CC8) used an avidin-biotin visualization system. slides were microwaved in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH6); blocked in 20% normal goat serum in phosphate-buffered saline. apoptotic GCs and/or oocytes were counted only when a MVH-positive oocyte was visible in the section. CC8 One or two middle sections per ovary were de-waxed and rehydrated through a graded series of ethanol and water. image analysis was performed with ImageJ software, with the assessor blind to treatments. the degree to which apoptotic cells were present in the ovaries was assessed by measuring the area of DAB-positive (CC8-expressing) stained cells. slides were microwaved in 10 mM sodium citrate (pH6; Fisher Chemical, Loughborough, UK) and blocked in 20% normal goat serum. MVH-positive oocyte with a DAPI-positive nucleus was visible in the section. the degree to which apoptotic cells were present in the ovaries was assessed by measuring the area of CC3 stained cells in the section relative to the area. ovaries were washed in ice-cold PBS and frozen on dry-ice. 20 micro-litres of lysis buffer containing 50 mM HEPES, 50 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktails 2 and 3 were added to two ovaries. after freezing, ovaries underwent a process for the separation of mitochondria and cytosol components. blots were incubated with Alexa Fluor 750 goat anti-rabbit (1:5000; Invitrogen, UK) for 1 h at room temperature. normal distribution was assessed using a non-parametric test of distribution; the Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. docetaxel affects the number and health of early growing but not primordial follicles in mice. whole mouse ovaries were maintained in vitro for 6 days. DOC significantly decreased the number of primary follicles only. only 5 1 primary follicles were left in these ovaries (Fig. 1A-iv and B-iv) docetaxel primarily affects follicles of early growing follicles. follicles were markedly affected by DOC exposure even at the lowest drug concentration. follicles of ovaries exposed to LOW-DOC dose showed signs of pyknosis. primary cell type affected by DOC exposure is the GCs of growing follicles. all unhealthy follicles were further classified as being unhealthy. ovaries used in three independent experiments showed increased DOC doses. one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests were applied. follicles containing CC3-positive cells were analysed manually or semi-automatically. total of ovaries used in three independent experiments: CONTROL= 5, LOW-DOC = 5, MID-DOC = 5 and HIGH-DOC = 4. CC3-expressing area of somatic (granulosa and stromal) cells within a section was measured and analysed relative to total section area. the degree of activation of programmed cell death of follicles detected by CC3 expression thus reflected the degree of damage observed by morphological observation. docetaxel activates caspase 8 (CC8: brown) to illustrate degree of apoptosis. ovaries used in three independent experiments. a total of six ovaries were used for each treatment group in five independent experiments. for cPARP, a total of 10 ovaries were used for each treatment group. for cPARP, a total of 10 ovaries were used for each treatment group in five independent experiments. Thyroid hormone (T3) does not mitigate DOC damage on mouse ovary. significant increase in the percentage of unhealthy follicles in ovary after culture did not decrease when exposed to DOC. whole mouse ovaries were treated with Docetaxel (DOC) for 24 h on day 2. DOC significantly decreased the number of primary follicles only. a lower percentage of unhealthy primary follicles in the HIGH-DOC than in the LOW- and MID-DOC groups. this may reflect the marked depletion of that follicle stage. the percentage of follicles with unhealthy oocytes, GCs only or both oocyte and GCs was determined. the primary cell type affected by DOC exposure is the GCs of growing follicles. all unhealthy follicles were further classified as being unhealthy due to the presence of (i) unhealthy oocyte only; (ii) unhealthy GCs only; (iii) both unhealthy oocyte and GCs (OO+GCs) one-way ANOVA followed by Bonferroni post hoc tests were applied. data are mean SEM. P 0.05 (*), P 0.01 (**), P 0.001 (***) for DOC versus CONTROL. total of ovaries used in three independent experiments: CONTROL= 5, LOW-DOC = 5, MID-DOC = 5 and HIGH-DOC = 4. Kruskal\u2013Wallis followed by Dunn post hoc tests were applied. ability of DOC to induce activation of the intracellular apoptotic pathway in the mouse ovary was tested by analysing expression of the following programmed cell death markers. area of somatic (granulosa and stromal) cells within a section was measured and analysed relative to total section area. degree of activation of programmed cell death of follicles detected by CC3 expression thus reflected the degree of damage observed by morphological observation after DOC treatment. ovarian sections exhibited little sign of CC8-positive apoptotic cells. sections were counterstained with Haematoxylin (blue). exposure to DOC increased expression of CC8 relative to section area. a total of six ovaries were used for each treatment group in three independent experiments. for cPARP, a total of 10 ovaries were used for each treatment group. for cPARP, a total of 10 ovaries were used for each treatment group in five independent experiments. a significant increase in the percentage of follicles that were unhealthy after exposure to LOW-DOC did not decrease when the ovaries were also exposed to T3. total of ovaries used per each group in four independent experiments: CONTROL = 7, T3 = 8, LOW-DOC = 6 and T3+LOW-DOC = 10. in vitro exposure of ovaries to clinically relevant doses of cisplatin induced a similar degree of damage to that observed in the present study. chemotherapeutic doses of DOC may well induce moderate levels of ovarian toxicity. some have suggested a marked effect of DOC. taxane administration in combination with other chemotherapy agents does add to the treatment's ovarian toxicity. there are some in vivo studies testing the effect of the first generation taxane, paclitaxel on primordial follicles in adult mice. the burnout model showed that immature, early growing follicles are severely affected by DOC, in both their number and quality, even at low DOC concentrations. the burnout model is also in accordance with the observations of others using high doses of paclitaxel on mice in vivo. doxorubicin is an anthracycline agent used in cancer treatment. stromal tissue is the first target, probably due to its contact with the circulatory system. stromal tissue is the first target, probably due to its contact with the circulatory system. oocyte death would follow as a downstream consequence of GC damage. DOC activates the intrinsic, mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic pathway in the somatic compartment of the ovary, inducing expression of key cell death markers. pro-caspase 8 is thought to be the first intracellular cysteine protease activated upon binding of a cell death receptor. GCs then activate the intrinsic, type II mitochondrial-dependent apoptotic cascade. thyroid hormone (T3) has been proposed to prevent paclitaxel-induced apoptosis in a rat GC line. DOC binds tubulin with higher affinity than paclitaxel and is capable of direct induction of apoptosis via bcl-2 phosphorylation. zacappa et al. (2012) is almost 30 times higher than the serum concentration of T3 in healthy people. the study in mice shows clear evidence of ovarian toxicity of DOC at clinically relevant concentrations. DOC was demonstrated here to cause loss of primary follicles, but with no evidence of direct effects on primordial follicles."}
