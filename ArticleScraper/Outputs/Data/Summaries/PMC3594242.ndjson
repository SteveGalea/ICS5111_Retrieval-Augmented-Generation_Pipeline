{"summary": "swine influenza pandemic highlighted sporadic human infections with avian H5N1 influenza viruses. antigenic changes in influenza virus, primarily in the surface antigens hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are called antigenic shift (subtype changes by reassortment) and antigenic drift (mutation) this variability among influenza viruses hinders vaccination efforts. the influenza A matrix (M) gene encodes two highly conserved proteins. an ion channel protein, M2, and the capsid protein, M1 are not a major protective antigen in the mouse. recombinant adenovirus vectors express the influenza antigens and focus immunity on these targets. novel adenovirus strain was identified in a study of more than 1000 adenoviruses isolated from chimpanzees and bonobos. we have generated a replication incompetent panAd3 vector deleted of E1 and E3 regions and expressing a fusion protein of the NP and M1 antigens of influenza A. the vaccine was tested for induction of antibody and T cell responses in the systemic and mucosal compartments in mice. denovirus type 3 (PanAd3) was isolated from a bonobo (Pan paniscus) the panAd3 isolate was amplified and the virus genome was then cloned in a plasmid vector and fully sequenced. the virus genome was then cloned in a plasmid vector. protein sequences were chosen from different subtype strains isolated between 1990 and 2009 that caused infection in humans worldwide. the NP consensus sequence was derived by alignment of all non-identical sequences (H1N1: 88 of 629 sequences, H1N2: 5 of 26, H3N2: 244 of 1557, H5N1: 50 of 121) using the majority rule. the panAd3 vectors were produced in Procell 92 cells. they were derived from the HEK 293 cell line originally banked at the university of leiden in 1973. the protocol for generating the Procell 92 cell line followed that published by Matthews et al. [37] vp measurements of adenovirus stocks were made by measurement of absorbance at 260 nm as described [39] an MHC-I restricted peptide of adenovirus DNA-binding protein (Dbp419\u2013427: FALSNAEDL), present in panAd3 [40] and recombinant M1 (rM1) protein from strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) were purchased from Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) mice were immunized at 10 weeks of age with indicated doses. some groups were challenged 4 weeks post-immunization with 104 TCID50 (100 LD50) of A/FM. mAb R4\u20136A2 (BD Pharmingen) followed by incubation with alkaline phosphatase\u2013labeled streptavidin (KPL, Gaithersburg, MD) Spots were counted with an ELISPOT reader (Zeiss; Thornwood, NY) antibody analysis Antibody levels in serum and BAL were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) chemiluminescent substrate (CSPD) was removed and replaced with 10% FCS. light emission (relative light units, RLU) was monitored 45 minutes after the addition of the CSPD substrate, using the Phospha-LightTM kit. panAd3 is a member of adenovirus species C, closely related to species C human and chimpanzee adenoviruses already used in preclinical and clinical trials (human Ad5, ChAd3). homologous recombination between pIX genes, right ITR DNA sequences present at the ends of linearized panAd3-EGFP shuttle. the NP sequence used in the panAd3 vaccine lacks the Nuclear Localization Signal residing in aa 6\u20138. NP and M1 sequences were spaced by a flexible linker (GGGSGGG) the resulting NPM1 sequence was codon-optimized for expression in eukaryotic cells. HEK 293 cells were transfected with an expression vector encoding the Tet repressor under control of the human phosphoglycerate kinase-1 (PGK) promoter. single clones were selected by growing the transfected cells in the presence of 1 mg/ml G418 in culture medium. an MHC-I restricted peptide of adenovirus DNA-binding protein (Dbp419\u2013427: FALSNAEDL), present in PanAd3 [40] and recombinant M1 (rM1) protein from strain A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) were purchased from Genscript (Piscataway, NJ) extracts were prepared 48 hours after infection using TEN buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl mucosal sampling Mice were euthanized and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and lung cells obtained as in Price et al., 2009. lungs were flushed with 1 ml phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) Lung cells were isolated by gradient centrifugation of minced and collagenase-digested lung tissue. etrazolium was used as the developing substrate (KPL) antibody analysis Antibody levels in serum and BAL were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) as in benton et al. [43]. Western blot analysis of the extracts was performed using a mouse hyperimmune serum raised against the NPM1 antigen. the 80 kD band was also detected if the Western blot was developed with a monoclonal antibody to NP. antibody responses Sera from individual mice 4 weeks after immunization were tested for antibodies to NP. reagent control provided by BAL from A/NP+M2-rAd5 immunized mice showed that the assay could detect IgA antibodies if present. ELISA for IgA antibodies to rNP in the BAL. results for three mice per group are reported as number of IFN- secreting cells per 106 cells. black bars, stimulation with NP147\u2013155 peptide. gray bars, stimulation with SARS209\u2013221 peptide. mice were immunized with doses of 109,107, or 105 vp per mouse. antibody responses Serum and BAL were analyzed for IgG antibodies to NP. at the highest vaccine dose, 109 vp per mouse, strong IgG responses were seen for PanAd3-NPM1. at a dose of 109 vp, PanAd3-NPM1 induced a strong T cell response in the lungs to the dominant NP147\u2013155 epitope. both panAd3-NPM1 and the PanAd3-RSV control induced modest responses to the adenovirus peptide Dbp419\u2013427. survival of the PanAd3-NPM1 group at the dose of 109 vp differs significantly (p0.05) from the PanAd3-RSV control group. cross-neutralization by human antibodies to Ad5 and PanAd3 are closely related viruses, both belonging to adenovirus group C [34] antibody responses Sera from individual mice 4 weeks after immunization were tested for antibodies to NP. anti-NP IgG antibodies were induced by i.n. but not i.m. immunization. three mice per group are reported as number of IFN- secreting cells per 106 cells. bars show mean SEM of pooled group triplicates, not individual animals. no response to NP was seen in mice immunized with constructs containing. antibody responses Sera from individual mice 4 weeks after immunization were tested for antibodies to NP. similar IgG responses to NP were detected in serum responses to PanAd3-NPM1 given either i.m. or i.n. at a dose of 109 viral particles (vp) ELISA for IgG antibodies to rNP in the BAL. ELISPOT for IFN- T cell responses. results for three mice per group are reported as number of IFN- secreting cells per 106 cells. mice were immunized with doses of 109,107, or 105 vp per mouse. antibody responses Serum and BAL were analyzed for IgG antibodies to NP and M1. both panAd3-NPM1 and the panAd3-RSV control induced modest responses to the adenovirus peptide Dbp419\u2013427. a hundred-fold lower dose of PanAd3-NPM1 induced little response to either NP147\u2013155 or Dbp419\u2013427. survival of the PanAd3-NPM1 group at the dose of 109 vp differs significantly (p0.05) from the PanAd3-RSV control group. cross-neutralization by human antibodies to Ad5 and PanAd3 are closely related viruses. ELISA for IgG antibodies to rM1 in the serum and BAL. the antibody response to PanAd3-NPM1 was undetectable in serum and marginal in BAL. the antibody response to the M1 component of PanAd3-NPM1 did not include IgA. mice were challenged with influenza virus A/FM at a dose of 104 TCID50 (100 LD50) per mouse. survival of the panAd3-NPM1 group at the dose of 109 vp differs significantly from the panAd3-RSV control group. chimpanzee adenoviruses have the potential advantage that humans have no prior exposure to them. in tests of Ad5 and four chimpanzee adenovirus vectors, prior immunization with a GFP-expressing construct blocked subsequent responses only for homologous vector. antibodies to NP can also contribute to protection [12]. the fusion protein of NP with M1 expressed by the panAd3 vaccine has the advantage of including another major target of human immunity. using multiple target antigens may invoke different immune mechanisms, reduce the likelihood of generating escape mutants."}
