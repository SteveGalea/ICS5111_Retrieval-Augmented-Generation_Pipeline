{"summary": "imDCs migrate from the blood into tissues, where they detect foreign antigens. they are activated and migrate to lymph nodes, where they present antigen-derived peptides to naive T lymphocytes. they induce an effective immune response (2\u20134). DC-SIGN is a tetrameric transmembrane protein, with each subunit comprising a long extracellular part with a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD), a 7.5 tandem repeat of 23 amino acids forming the neck region, and a transmembrane part followed by a cytoplasmic tail containing recycling and internalization motifs. the neck configuration is likely to play a significant role in pathogen capture (23). DC-SIGN nanocluster formation and/or stability do not require interactions with the cortical cytoskeleton (27) or association with tetraspanins (27). however, it is not clear whether the nanoclustering capacity of DC-SIGN also requires the presence of the CRD. 50,000 cells were incubated with 50 g/ml Alexa647-mannan in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 and 1% BSA (TSA buffer) the percentage of cells that had bound mannan was detected by flow cytometry using the FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer. the percentage of CHO cells that had acquired an FITC+ signal was quantified by flow cytometry. CHO cell lines stably expressing DC-SIGN wild type were incubated with anti-DC-SIGN mAb hD1 (5 g/ml) in serum-free medium for 20 min on ice. CHO transfectants allowed to adhere and spread on glass coverslips covered by a thin layer of Formvar for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. after two washing steps with PBS and blocking buffer, the samples were incubated for 30 min with primary antibodies (DCN46 Ab) for DC-SIGN-wt, -CRD, and -35 or anti-AU1 Ab (Covance) for DC-SIGN-Rep. anti-neck Ab DCN46 was applied to label all DC-SIGN molecules except the -Repeat mutant (31, 32) no significant differences in the nanoclustered organization of this receptor were observed. digital TEM images were processed by custom-written software based on Matlab. Fab fragments and monovalent antibodies were biotinylated and linked to streptavidin-coated quantum dots (Qdot655, Invitrogen) samples were imaged using a custom-made single molecule epimicroscope. films were recorded on upper side of the cell membrane at 30\u201360 Hz frame rates. Binding was determined by measuring the percentage of cells that have bound fluorescent beads by flow cytometry. CHO transfectants were incubated with FITC-labeled zymosan particles in the absence or the presence of mannan (100 g/ml) or anti-DC-SIGN mAb AZN-D1 (20 g/ml) in TSA buffer. cells were placed back on ice for 15 min to stop internalization. the other half was shifted to 37 \u00b0C for 15 min to induce internalization. unbound Abs were washed away, and cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde. anti-AU1 as well as anti-DC-SIGN AZN-D1 and DCN46 antibodies have been used for labeling and comparing DCSIGN wild type and the different mutants. anti-AU1, AZN-D1 and DCN46 antibodies were used to label all DC-SIGN molecules except the -CRD mutant. secondary ab labeling was performed with 30 nm Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse Ab (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. washing steps were performed with cold PBS buffer (1). Isotype controls were performed in every experiment in order to rule out nonspecific Ab binding. 50,000 cells were incubated with 50 g/ml Alexa647-mannan in 20 mm Tris, pH 8.0, containing 150 mm NaCl, 1 mm CaCl2, 2 mm MgCl2 and 1% BSA (TSA buffer) the percentage of cells that had bound mannan was detected by flow cytometry using the FACSCaliburTM flow cytometer. CHO transfectants were incubated with FITC-labeled zymosan particles in the absence of mannan (100 g/ml) or anti-DC-SIGN mAb AZN-D1 (20 g/ml) in TSA buffer. the percentage of CHO cells that had acquired an FITC+ signal was quantified by flow cytometry. the samples were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (to detect mAb) for 30 min on ice. anti-AU1 as well as anti-DC-SIGN AZN-D1 and DCN46 antibodies were used for labeling and comparing DCSIGN wild type and the different mutants. anti-CRD Ab AZN-D1 was used to label all DC-SIGN molecules except the -Repeat mutant (31, 32) no significant differences in the nanoclustered organization of this receptor were observed when anti-AU1, AZN-D1 and DCN46 labeling were compared for the DC-SIGN wild type. the Fab fragments and the monovalent antibodies were biotinylated and linked to streptavidin-coated quantum dots (Qdot655, Invitrogen) samples were imaged using a custom-made single molecule epimicroscope. films were recorded on the upper side of the cell membrane at 30\u201360 Hz frame rates. the values represent the mean S.D. of duplicates of one representative experiment of three. Binding to gp120 beads was performed as already reported (11) unbound Abs were washed away, and cells were fixed in 1% formaldehyde. the percentage of internalized mAb was calculated by flow cytometry. the samples were incubated with rabbit anti-mouse IgG (to detect mAb) for 30 min on ice. a final incubation with 10-nm diameter gold-labeled Protein A was performed. anti-AU1 as well as anti-DC-SIGN AZN-D1 and DCN46 antibodies have been used for labeling and comparing DCSIGN wild type and different mutants. the cells were stained with 30 nm DCN46 Ab (Pharmingen) or anti-AU1 Ab (Covance) for 30 min at room temperature. secondary ab labeling was performed with 30 nm Alexa Fluor 488-labeled goat anti-mouse Ab (Invitrogen) for 30 min at room temperature. DC-SIGN mutants are denoted as CRD (lacking the CRD domain), Rep (lacking the tandem repeat in the extracellular neck region), and 35 (lacking the first 35 amino acids from the N terminus in the extracellular tail) the mutants are denoted as CRD (lacking the CRD domain), Rep (lacking the tandem repeat in the extracellular neck region), and 35 (lacking the first 35 amino acids from the N terminus in the extracellular tail) gp120-coated fluorescent nanobeads (40 nm in diameter) and micrometer-sized FITC-zymosan (D) were measured by FACS. specificity was determined by measuring binding in the presence of anti-DC-SIGN blocking Ab (AZN-D1) or Ca2+-chelating agent EDTA or soluble non-fluorescent mannan. lower binding of DC-SIGN-35 in all cases is due to its lower expression level as compared with -wt, -CRD, and -Rep. binding of DC-SIGN and its mutants to soluble ligands and large particles occurs with similar efficiency. the neck region of DC-SIGN is crucial to ensure binding of small virus-sized particles. the cytoplasmic tail of DC-SIGN is crucial for clathrin-dependent endocytosis. the neck region has no major influence on internalization. CHO cells stably transfected with DC-SIGN constructs were incubated with anti-DCSIGN mAb hD1 at 4 \u00b0C, washed, and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. TEM images of immunogold-labeled DC-SIGN-wt showed a non-homogeneous receptor distribution over the cell membrane. similar nanoclustered organization was found for the CRD and the 35 mutants. the large majority of the DC-SIGN-Rep nanoclusters contain at the most 2\u20133 particles (Fig. 3C) the distribution of cluster sizes decays very rapidly, significantly overlapping with that of simulations of random organization. the probability of finding clusters of four particles is nearly 6-fold lower in case of DC-SIGN-Rep. TEM shows the presence of DC-SIGN nanoclustering on CHO cells. steric hindrance between Abs and/or gold beads can induce non-saturated receptor labeling, potentially leading to an underestimation of nanoclustering. significantly weaker florescent spots were retrieved when performing STED imaging of DC-SIGN-Rep on CHO cells. the physical size of the spots was determined from multiple superresolution images by directly measuring their full width at half-maximum. fluorescent spots of DC-SIGN-wt on CHO cells and endogenous DC-SIGN on imDCs exhibited similar average sizes (180 nm) superresolution optical nanoscopy confirms loss of nanoclustering for DC-SIGN-Rep. insets highlight increased resolution of STED compared with diffraction-limited confocal microscopy. images were obtained on a CW-STED system (Leica Microsystems) images were obtained on a custom-built NSOM/confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert) images were obtained on a custom-built NSOM/confocal microscope (Zeiss Axiovert) DC-SIGN nanoclusters are freely mobile on CHO cells and imDCs. a sample time series of DC-SIGN-Qdots were performed using a custom single-molecule sensitive epifluorescence microscope. each histogram contains at least 100 trajectories taken from >50 cells. D2\u20134 values of DC-SIGN-wt nanoclusters varied from 103 to 101 m2/s. the distribution of DC-SIGN-rep was significantly narrower and shifted to larger D2\u20134 values. the higher D2\u20134 values observed on DC-SIGN-Rep are entirely consistent with nanocluster dissolution. the average D value of DC-SIGN is higher than that of DC-SIGN-wt. the immobile fraction (D 6 104 m2/s) of DC-SIGN in the three cases accounted for 10% of all trajectories analyzed. the complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf) is obtained and plotted versus n. the ccdf value for a given n represents the probability that at least n receptors are accessible to the pathogen at the moment of membrane contact. the larger the number of accessible receptors, the more likely it is for ligands on the pathogen surface to engage specific bonds with the membrane receptors. a slight increase in clustering percentage from 60 to 80% already produces a 5-fold probability enhancement. a change from random distribution to 80% clustering induces at most a 5-fold increase in the ccdf (n = 30), and a significant change is only observed in the case of total clustering for n > 40. clust = 5 and finally overlapping with the ccdf simulated for nclust = 8. the heterogeneity experimentally observed for the molecular density of DC-SIGN nanoclusters might serve to effectively broaden its binding capabilities to a variety of viruses. lateral mobility of nanoclusters, as observed in our experiments, will then further virus capture by increasing the probability of encountering events. mutated DC-SIGN forms are functional but have impaired virus-binding capacity. the black histogram represents the isotype control, and the red histogram indicates the specific staining with anti-DC-SIGN Ab (anti-AU1) binding of soluble fluorescent Alexa647-mannan (B), gp120-coated fluorescent nanobeads (40 nm) (C) and micrometer-sized FITC-zymosan (D) was measured real HIV-1 virus particles were bound by CHO cells expressing DC-SIGN-wt and not by DC-SIGN-Rep. this was confirmed by using nanobeads as virus-like particles. cytoplasmic tail (DC-SIGN-35) significantly reduced internalization. the cytoplasmic tail of DC-SIGN is crucial for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, whereas the neck region has no major influence on internalization. the cytoplasmic tail of DC-SIGN is crucial for clathrin-dependent endocytosis. the neck region has no major influence on internalization. cells were kept on ice (0 min at 37 \u00b0C) or shifted for 10 min at 37 \u00b0C to induce endocytosis (10 min at 37 \u00b0C) after fixation and permeabilization, clathrin (green) was labeled. the sample was analyzed by confocal microscopy on a leica DMRA fluorescence microscope equipped with a COHU CCD camera. the large majority (80%) of receptors are organized in nanoclusters. this percentage drops to 60% for DC-SIGN-Rep. the cluster probability distributions are similar for DC-SIGN-wt, -CRD, and -35. CHO cells expressing DC-SIGN-wt and DC-SIGN-Rep. anti-AU1 mAb and 10-nm gold particles were used to specifically stain DC-SIGN. results are representative of multiple cells in several independent experiments. confocal and STED images of DC-SIGN-wt on the membrane of fixed CHO cells are shown in Fig. 4, A and B. similar results were obtained when imaging DC-SIGN on monocyte-derived imDCs using a combined single molecule confocal/NSOM set-up at an optical resolution of 90 nm. anocluster value reduced to 1.8 (S.D. = 0.8) in case of DC-SIGN-Rep. intermolecular interactions mediated by the neck region regulate different hierarchical levels of receptor spatial organization on the cell membrane. the inset shows the corresponding intensity of spots found on glass. shown are 266 and 198 spots of DC-SIGN-wt and -Rep, respectively, from multiple STED images. mobility of DC-SIGN-wt nanoclusters and DC-SIGN-Rep was observed on CHO cells and imDCs. a sample time series of DC-SIGN-Qdots were performed to illustrate the mobility of DC-SIGN-wt nanoclusters. each histogram contains at least 100 trajectories taken from >50 cells. at least 250 trajectories/histogram from >40 cells in multiple experiments were analyzed. D, cumulative mean squared displacement plots of DC-SIGN-wt (black), DC-SIGN-Rep (blue), and DC-SIGN on imDC. immobile fraction (D 6 104 m2/s) of DC-SIGN in the three cases accounted for 10% of all trajectories analyzed. the results confirm lateral mobility of DC-SIGN nanoclusters within the cell membrane and further evidence a faster diffusion of DC-SIGN-Rep fully consistent with nanocluster dissolution at the cell membrane. pathogens are approximated as spheres of radius r and the membrane as a flat square region with lateral size L r. the number of DC-SIGN receptors (n) within the area projected by the pathogen is counted. the complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf) is obtained and plotted versus n. ccdf decays at higher n, indicating an increased probability of having more accessible receptors around the virus contact point. a slight increase in clustering percentage from 60 to 80%, similar to what is observed in the TEM images for DC-SIGN-Rep and -wt, already produces a 5-fold probability enhancement. the cluster size depends linearly on the number of receptors per cluster. the presence of clusters formed by a larger number of receptors progressively shifted the ccdf decay toward larger n. ccdf initially follows the same behavior as that simulated for nclust = 3, to then decay similarly as nclust = 5 and finally overlapping with the ccdf simulated for nclust = 8. DC-SIGN-wt, -Rep, and -35 bind to fluorescent soluble mannan. lack of the CRD expectedly prevents binding. results confirm that DC-SIGN-wt, -Rep, and -35 are all functional on CHO cells. to investigate the DC-SIGN capability for virus docking, we carried out binding assays to gp120-coated nanobeads (40 nm in diameter; Fig. 1C) having a size comparable with HIV-1 (35). Interestingly, significant binding is only observed on DC-SIGN-wt and -35. tail impacts on DC-SIGN clathrin-dependent internalization. cytoplasmic tail of DC-SIGN is crucial for clathrin-dependent endocytosis. neck region has no major influence on internalization. CHO cells stably transfected with DC-SIGN constructs were incubated with hD1 at 4 \u00b0C, washed, and incubated for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C to induce endocytosis. after staining with a fluorescent secondary Ab, the samples were analyzed by flow cytometry. the percentage of internalization was calculated as indicated in the supplemental Methods. TEM images of immunogold-labeled DC-SIGN-wt showed a non-homogeneous receptor distribution over the cell membrane. similar nanoclustered organization was found for the CRD and the 35 mutants (supplemental Fig. S2). the probability of finding clusters of four particles is nearly 6-fold lower in DC-SIGN-Rep. deletion of the neck region severely reduces the aggregation state of DC-SIGN at the nanoscale. results are representative of multiple cells in several independent experiments. TEM shows the presence of DC-SIGN nanoclustering on CHO cells. steric hindrance between Abs and/or gold beads can induce non-saturated receptor labeling, potentially leading to an underestimation of nanoclustering. fluorescent spots of DC-SIGN-wt on CHO cells and endogenous DC-SIGN on imDCs exhibited similar average sizes (180 nm) and comparable size distributions. this value reduced to 1.8 (S.D. = 0.8) in case of DC-SIGN-Rep. images were obtained on a CW-STED system (Leica Microsystems) with a 100/1.4 numerical aperture oil immersion objective (Zeiss) the average spot sizes are 186 nm (55 nm) and 108 nm (24 nm) for DC-SIGN-wt and -Rep. the inset shows the spot sizes obtained from individual Abs nonspecifically attached to glass. the inset shows the corresponding intensity of spots found on glass. DC-SIGN nanoclusters are mobile on CHO cells and imDCs. Experiments were performed using a custom single-molecule sensitive epifluorescence microscope equipped with a 63/1.2 numerical aperture water immersion objective (Olympus) and an EM-CCD camera. each histogram contains at least 100 trajectories taken from >50 cells in multiple experiments. the distribution of DC-SIGN-Rep was significantly narrower and shifted to larger D2\u20134 values, with a median value of D2\u20134 = 1.23 101 m2/s. to validate our results on CHO cells, we performed single Qdot tracking of endogenous DC-SIGN nanoclusters. these results confirm lateral mobility of DC-SIGN nanoclusters within the cell membrane and further evidence a faster diffusion of DC-SIGN-Rep fully consistent with nanocluster dissolution at the cell membrane. we wished to understand the impact of receptor organization and, in particular, the role of DC-SIGN nanoclustering on viral binding. the larger the number of accessible receptors n, the more likely it is for ligands on the pathogen surface to engage specific bonds with the membrane receptors. ccdf for having a given number of receptors at the pathogen-cell interface for two pathogen radii (50 and 500 nm) a change from random distribution to 80% clustering induces at most a 5-fold increase in the ccdf (n = 30), and a significant change is only observed in the case of total clustering for n > 40. a mechanistic explanation for the distinct binding capabilities of DC-SIGN by correlating pathogen size with DC-SIGN spatial organization. Mutated DC-SIGN forms are functional but have impaired virus-binding capacity. mutants are denoted as CRD (lacking the CRD domain), Rep (lacking the tandem repeat in the extracellular neck region) and 35 (lacking the first 35 amino acids from the N terminus in the cytoplasmic tail) soluble fluorescent Alexa647-mannan (B), gp120-coated fluorescent nanobeads (40 nm) (C) and micrometer-sized FITC-zymosan (D) were measured by FACS. binding of soluble fluorescent Alexa647-mannan (B), gp120-coated fluorescent nanobeads (40 nm) (C) and micrometer-sized FITC-zymosan (D) to CHO cells high binding was retrieved for DC-SIGN-wt and all mutants, except for DC-SIGN-CRD, in similar fashion as found for the soluble ligand. the lower binding of DC-SIGN-35 in all cases is due to its lower expression level as compared with -wt, -CRD, and -Rep. triggering of endocytosis by shifting temperature to 37 \u00b0C for 10 min induced significant colocalization with clathrin for DC-SIGN-wt and DC-SIGN-Rep but not for DC-SIGN-35. cytoplasmic tail of DC-SIGN is crucial for clathrin-dependent endocytosis, whereas neck region has no major influence on internalization. TEM images of immunogold-labeled DC-SIGN-wt showed a non-homogeneous receptor distribution over the cell membrane. similar nanoclustered organization was found for the CRD and the 35 mutants (supplemental Fig. S2). the cluster probability distributions are similar for DC-SIGN-wt, -CRD, and -35. the cluster probability distributions are similar for DC-SIGN-wt, -CRD, and -35, indicating that the CRD and the cytoplasmic tail of DC-SIGN do not play a role in DC-SIGN nanoclustering. the results are compared with simulations of random organization with similar surface density as in the experiments. a t test was used to compare the data of DC-SIGN-wt with DC-SIGN-CRD data and to compare DC-SIGN-35 data with DC-SIGN-Rep data. similar results were obtained when imaging DC-SIGN on monocyte-derived imDCs using a combined single molecule confocal/NSOM set-up at an optical resolution of 90 nm. in contrast, significantly weaker florescent spots were retrieved when performing STED imaging of DC-SIGN-Rep on CHO cells. superresolution optical nanoscopy confirms loss of nanoclustering for DC-SIGN-Rep. insets highlight increased resolution of STED compared with diffraction-limited confocal microscopy. inset shows spot sizes obtained from individual Abs nonspecifically attached to glass. NSOM confirms DC-SIGN nanoclustering on imDC. insets highlight increased resolution of NSOM compared with diffraction-limited confocal microscopy. images were obtained on a custom-built NSOM/confocal microscope. clear mobility of DC-SIGN-wt nanoclusters and DC-SIGN-Rep was observed on CHO cells and imDCs. each histogram contains at least 100 trajectories taken from >50 cells in multiple experiments. at least 250 trajectories/histogram from >40 cells were analyzed. the inset shows the percentage of trajectories with D2\u20134 6 104 m2/s and classified as immobile. to quantify the degree of mobility of DC-SIGN, we built individual trajectories from multiple movies and generated plots of the mean squared displacement as a function of time lag. lags for DC-SIGN-wt, DC-SIGN-Rep on CHO and DC-SIGN on imDCs. the average D value of DC-SIGN-rep is higher than that of DC-SIGN-wt. the immobile fraction (D 6 104 m2/s) of DC-SIGN in the three cases accounted for 10% of all trajectories analyzed. the complementary cumulative distribution function (ccdf) is obtained and plotted versus n. the ccdf value for a given n represents the probability that at least n receptors are accessible to the pathogen at the moment of membrane contact. the larger the number of accessible receptors n, the more likely it is for ligands on the pathogen surface to engage specific bonds with the membrane receptors. a slight increase in clustering percentage from 60 to 80% produces a 5-fold probability enhancement. a change from random distribution to 80% clustering induces at most a 5-fold increase in the ccdf (n = 30), and a significant change is only observed in the case of total clustering. ccdf initially follows same behavior as that simulated for nclust = 3, to decay similarly as nclust = 5 and finally overlapping with the ccdf simulated for nclust = 8. the heterogeneity experimentally observed for the molecular density of DC-SIGN nanoclusters might serve to effectively broaden its binding capabilities to a variety of viruses. our binding assays show that the CRD of the neck-truncated mutant is fully available for binding to both soluble ligands and micrometer-sized objects. the impaired binding to virus-like particles is mostly due to the lack of nanocluster spatial organization of DC-SIGN. this results thus reflect different functional properties of DC-SIGN directly related to its molecular structure. nascent clathrin-coated pits are likely to appear as immobile features at the observed time scale. homophilic interactions mediated by the neck region of DC-SIGN are essential to coordinate its spatiotemporal organization on the cell membrane. DC-SIGN binds with equal efficiency to viruses of different sizes (from dengue (50 nm) to HIV (100 nm) and measles virus (200\u2013300 nm) real HIV virus cannot bind to DC-SIGN-Rep. GN."}
