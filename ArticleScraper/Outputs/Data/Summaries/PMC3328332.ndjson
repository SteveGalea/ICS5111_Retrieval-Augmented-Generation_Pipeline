{"summary": "the most common therapy for chronic hepatitis C consists of pegylated interferon- (IFN) and ribavirin administration which results in viral clearance in 43\u201346% (genotype 1) to 80%, (genotype 3) of treated patients. interferon will continue to be a major component of new direct acting antivirals for treatment of HCV [2]. the extent of cell proliferation in the thymus can be measured in patients through estimating the ratio between the frequency of signal joint T-cell receptor excision circles (sjTREC) produced during the excision of the TCR locus prior to TCR chain rearrangement. increased proliferation between DN3 and DP leads to the reduction of DJTREC frequency in RTEs as compared to sjTREC frequency. IFN and ribavirin therapy induce a substantial reduction of circulating sjTRECs in HIV/HCV co-infected patients. recombinant interleukin (IL)-7 therapy more than abrogated deleterious effects of IFN therapy [30] nave CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell counts were significantly reduced in chronically HCV-infected patients. similar effect was also observed in most co-infected patients. nave T-cell counts were only barely affected in acutely-HCV infected patients. central memory CD4+ T-cells (CD45 RA- CCR7+; TCM) showed 38% and 28% decrease in HCV and HIV/HCV patients respectively. effector memory (CD45RA CCR7\u2013; TEM) CD4+ T-cell counts declined by 45% and 10% in same groups. the proportion of CD31hi cells in nave CD4+ (CD45RA+ CCR7+) T-cells was significantly reduced by M1 in acutely HCV-infected patients. chronically HCV-infected patients demonstrated lower absolute numbers of CD31hi nave T-cells by M1. IFN therapy in acutely HCV-infected (left panels), chronically HCV-infected (central panels) and HIV/HCV co-infected (right panels) patients demonstrated more stable sjTREC/mL values that eventually declined at M4. as early as one month following treatment initiation, IFN induces stronger alterations of nave T-cell subsets. we thus analyzed the evolution of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation, peripheral T-cell cycling, IL-7 plasma concentration and IL-7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) expression. IFN therapy leads to major impairment of thymic function. the sj/TREC ratio was already low in HIV-infected patients. acutely HCV-infected patients showed higher than normal sj/TREC ratio. sj/TREC ratio was already low in HIV-infected patients. IL-7 plasma concentrations significantly decreased in both groups of HCV-infected patients. only patients with the highest IL-7 plasma levels showed a reduction in the concentration of this cytokine. IL-7 plasma levels were quantified in peripheral blood cells from acutely HCV-infected patients. decreased plasma IL-7 concentrations could be a consequence of reduced IL-7 production, increased consumption by T-cells or sequestration by soluble IL-7 receptor (sCD127) in both HCV-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients, neither sCD127 plasma concentration (Figure 4C) nor CD127 expression by CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells (Figure 4D) significantly changed during IFN therapy. IL-7 plasma levels also correlated with changes in the proportions (%Ki-67+ in CD4+RTEs; r = 0.806, p = 0.0002; Figure 5C) of cycling RTEs in acute and chronic HCV infected patients and with %Ki-67+RTE counts in co-infected patients. IL-7 concentration was associated with reduced thymopoiesis and RTE proliferation. changes in IL-7 plasma levels during IFN therapy directly impact the homeostasis of RTEs. patients were enrolled at the beginning of IFN therapy. nave T-cell counts were only barely affected in acutely-HCV infected patients under IFN therapy. central memory CD4+ T-cells (CD45 RA- CCR7+; TCM) showed 38% and 28% decrease in HCV and HIV/HCV patients respectively. effector memory (CD45RA CCR7\u2013; TEM) CD4+ T-cell counts declined by 45% and 10% in same groups. the proportion of CD31hi cells in nave CD4+ (CD45RA+ CCR7+) T-cells was significantly reduced by M1 in acutely HCV-infected patients. chronically HCV-infected patients demonstrated lower absolute numbers of CD31hi nave T-cells by M1 (p0.05 at M1 and M4) sjTREC content was in the range of age matched healthy individuals at baseline (figure 2A) but declined significantly in both subgroups of HCV-infected patients by one month following treatment initiation. sjTREC content was in the range of age matched healthy individuals at baseline (figure 2A) we thus analyzed the evolution of intrathymic precursor T-cell proliferation, peripheral T-cell cycling, IL-7 plasma concentration and IL-7 receptor alpha chain (CD127) expression. IFN therapy leads to major impairment of thymic function. the sj/TREC ratio was already low in HIV-infected patients. acutely HCV-infected patients showed higher than normal sj/TREC ratio. sj/TREC ratio was already low in HIV-infected patients. IL-7 plasma concentrations significantly decreased in both groups of HCV-infected patients. only patients with the highest IL-7 plasma levels showed a reduction in the concentration of this cytokine. IL-7 plasma levels were quantified in peripheral blood cells from acutely HCV-infected patients. decreased plasma IL-7 concentrations could be a consequence of reduced IL-7 production, increased consumption by T-cells or sequestration by soluble IL-7 receptor (sCD127) in both HCV-infected and HIV/HCV co-infected patients, neither sCD127 plasma concentration (Figure 4C) nor CD127 expression by CD4+ or CD8+ T-cells (Figure 4D) significantly changed during IFN therapy. IL-7 plasma levels correlate with evolution of RTE. production. correlations between variations in IL-7 plasma levels (IL-7) and variations in (A) total (CD4+ + CD8+) nave T-cell counts (nave T-cell counts), (B) RTE defined as CD31hi nave CD4+ T-cells (RTE CD4 counts), (C) the sj/TREC ratio (sj/TREC ratio), (D) the frequency of Ki- IL-7 concentration was associated with reduced thymopoiesis and RTE proliferation, lower consequently leading to limited circulating RTE and nave T-cell counts. iFN-based therapy leads to major lymphocytopenia in nave T-cell compartments, in particular in the RTE subset. no major change in cell survival (Bcl-2 expression) or T-cell activation (CD25 and CD69 expression) was observed during the first month of therapy. asis (cycling, survival/apoptosis, homing) is a marker of the intrathymic proliferation history of RTEs. further cell cycling after TCR chain rearrangement does not modify the sj/TREC ratio. however, the decline of the sj/TREC ratio observed during the first months of IFN therapy defines changes in thymocyte proliferation, thus in thymic output. the correlation between decline in IL-7 plasma levels under IFN therapy and both thymic dysfunction and reduced nave T-cell and RTE counts in rhesus macaques. this effect was accompanied by a 30\u201340% decrease in IL-7 plasma levels in these animals and could be counteracted by injection of recombinant simian IL-7 [30]. increased IL-7 plasma levels in lymphopenic individuals is likely due to reduced consumption [46] yet augmented production to counteract lymphopenia cannot be excluded [33] the recent identification of the liver as an IL-7 producing tissue upon TLR stimulation makes it tempting to speculate that HCV-infection can also stimulate IL-7 production by the liver. a substantial reduction in thymic export was observed in HCV-infected patients, during the first months of IFN therapy. this effect directly paralleled IFN-induced lymphocytopenia and decreased IL-7 plasma levels, initially high in HCV-infected patients. IL-7 production by the liver was reduced while patients controlled HCV viremia. patients included in the acute phase of HCV infection were treated with pegylated IFN/ribavirin treatment (IFN-2a: Pegasys, 180 g weekly, Ribavirin: Copegus, 800 mg to 1000 g daily) patients from the HIV-HCV groups were followed at the H\u00f4pital Henri Mondor, Creteil, France.
