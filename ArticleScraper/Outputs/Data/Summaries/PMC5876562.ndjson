{"summary": "the poultry industry is of high importance to the region, not only in relation to the production of locally consumed food, but also for the production of poultry products for trade and export. the production and trade of poultry and poultry products are substantial contributors to gross domestic product (GDP) for many Caribbean countries. this review aims to collate and summarize the information and data available on the occurrence of eight priority viruses of poultry within the Caribbean region. the review provides important information related to the presence/absence of these viruses in Caribbean countries. it highlights knowledge gaps from a pathogen and a country perspective for targeting surveillance activities. information related to the notification and monitoring of disease status information was obtained from the world organisation for animal health (OIE) in some instances, information was also sourced from and confirmed by relevant poultry and veterinary officers in the various countries. relevant reports and publications related to the eight priority viruses in any Caribbean country were considered for inclusion in the review. all reports/publications describing the detection of viruses and outbreaks of disease in both vaccinated and unvaccinated poultry were reviewed. when information pertaining to vaccination history was given in the relevant report/publication, this information was included. the virus can cause severe infection with high mortality rates. due to its segmented RNA genome, AIV is prone to reassortment. this feature is often implicated in the spread of infection to poultry dwellings. the LPAI virus from the DR showed 95.5% similarity to a strain that had been circulating in the USA since 1994. the LPAI virus from the DR showed 95.5% similarity to a strain that had been circulating in the USA since 1994. a serological study found that 18.8% of backyard poultry had antibodies to AIV; however, in a subsequent study, no viral antibodies were detected in commercial layers and broilers on the island. there have been only limited number of reports of AIV from Caribbean island states, but the potential always exists for AIV to emerge and circulate on these islands. some countries across the Caribbean carry out routine vaccination against IBV to prevent significant economic losses from outbreaks of clinical disease. there is regional evidence that the field circulating viruses are in some cases evading vaccination. of the mainland CARICOM countries, Belize and Guyana have reported the presence of IBV in their poultry. the circulating IBV viruses were not identified and characterized in the studies from Grenada and T & T. it is currently unknown whether field or vaccine strains of IBV are circulating on these islands. Newcastle disease (ND) is considered endemic in many countries worldwide. in the Caribbean island states, a severe outbreak of ND was reported in the DR in 2008. both the virus isolates from Belize and the DR were found to be virulent NDV strains based on intracerebral pathogenicity index scores, clinicopathological assessments, fusion protein cleavage site analysis. ILTV is a highly contagious virus of poultry that can cause severe respiratory disease. the virus persists in infected birds for life. there have been multiple reports of ILTV outbreaks in various south american countries. aMPV is an important respiratory virus of poultry, causing severe disease in turkeys and to a lesser extent in chickens. clinical signs were not reported in the antibody positive flocks in both studies and birds were not vaccinated against the virus. the virus has been reported to be present in nearby Brazil and Venezuela. infectious bursal disease Virus IBDV causes a highly contagious disease of young chickens known as infectious bursal disease. it weakens the immune system leaving birds highly susceptible to secondary infections. there are no reports of IBDV circulation in the Caribbean region. in 1996 alone, 245,921 poultry deaths by IBDV were reported in the year 2000. poor vaccine dosage administration and issues with cold storage of the vaccines were thought to be the main causes for the apparent vaccine failure. otypes of FADV Gp1 are available, but are not widely used in the Caribbean. avian adenoviruses are not widely reported to be present in the Caribbean. avian adenoviruses are not widely reported in the Caribbean region. avian adenoviruses are circulating in T & T, but they are not necessarily causing clinical disease in infected birds. avian adenoviruses may suppress the immune system of infected birds, making them more susceptible to other potential pathogens. active surveillance in response to outbreaks of disease is carried out in many of the larger poultry-producing countries of the Caribbean. limited levels of passive surveillance is carried out in most Caribbean states."}
