{"summary": "hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver-related death and the prime indication for liver transplantation worldwide. chronic hepatitis C is a leading cause of liver-related death and the prime indication for liver transplantation. a recent study showed infection, replication and de novo virus production in an inbred mouse strain engineered to express human HCV entry factors in the liver and carrying a targeted lesion within innate immune signalling genes. this landmark study shows that HCV can be propagated in mice and raises the hope that more robust models ultimately with fully functional innate and adaptive immune system can be developed. the Flavivridae family consists of three other genera: flaviviruses including yellow fever and dengue virus. pestiviruses include bovine viral diarrhea virus and classical swine fever virus and the recently assigned pegivirus genus. despite substantial sequence variation, all genotypes share the same genome structure. the single open reading frame (ORF) is flanked by two highly conserved untranslated regions (UTRs) the prevalence of HCV genotypes differs significantly in different parts of the world. phylogeny was generated using 54 nucelotide sequences encoding a 534-bp fragment at the N-terminus of the NS3 gene. phylogeny was generated using the maximum likelihood method implemented in MEGA5. values assigned to deep internal nodes within the phylogeny represent bootstrap supports for groupings. a number of novel hepaciviruses have been identified in different host species. the virus was independently sequenced from dogs with a respiratory illness from two different outbreaks of respiratory disease in the united states. no healthy animals were found to be infected. the viral genome of CHV encodes a 2942 amino acid (aa) polyprotein. it is predicted to be cleaved into 10 mature viral proteins. this is similar to that described for HCV5. ancestor between the HCV genotypes and CHV was estimated to be between 500 and 1000 years before present (Ybp) reference cartoons depict locations of homologous protease cleavage sites. coordinates located above each cartoon represent the first residue of each encoded protein. the authors tentatively termed these viruses NPHV. the authors tentatively termed these viruses NPHV. the original CHV variants showed a very high similarity (maximum of 0.35% divergence) to one of the eight NPHV variants, whereas the eight horse-derived NPHV sequences themselves had moderate genome sequence diversity from each other. the structural region showed a greater divergence than the non-structural region. the newly discovered hepaciviruses, host species, sequence accession number and isolate designation. the newly discovered hepaciviruses, host species, sequence accession number and isolate designation. GHV-1 BWC05 KC551802 GHV-2 BWC04 a Only viruses listed whose near full-length genomes were generated. the group of Simmonds and colleagues analyzed NPHV in domestic horses in the united kingdom. the organ tropism of NPHV has yet to be elucidated. further studies on viral associated pathogenesis, the course of clinical disease and likely mode(s of transmission are required to fully understand the nature of NPHV infection in horses. a putative miR-122 seed site was apparent in the 5\u2032 UTR. it suggests a possible dependence on miR-122 of these novel viruses. the polyprotein is predicted to encode 10 proteins similar in predicted size to those of HCV and other hepaciviruses. the identity of the novel rodent viruses to HCV averaged in the structural proteins between 15.1% and 31.3%. in the non-structural proteins from 16.3% to 42.2%. all RHV clades were slightly more related to GBV-B than to HCV. the group of Quan and colleagues15 identified bats as a major natural reservoir for hepaciviruses and pegiviruses. the group used an unbiased high-throughput sequencing approach to enhance the knowledge of viral diversity in bats. the group was able to identify 83 bat-derived viruses, which potentially represent 22 novel viral species. single ORF, flanked at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end by non-translated regions, encoding a polyprotein precursor of about 2901 to 3024 aa. most conserved regions were the NS3 and NS5B proteins, with aa sequence identities of 39.2%\u201353.3% in the NS3 gene and 35.3%\u201346% in the NS5B gene. the first hepacivirus infecting a wild non-human primate was the black-and-white colobus (Colobus guereza), an old world monkey from Uganda. the virus, named gnereza hepacivirus (GHV), was shown to share a common ancestry with GBV-B. GHV NS5B shares the highest sequence similarity with BHV. cross-species transmission and ancient recombination may have contributed to the evolution of GHV. hepaciviruses have been identified in different host species. the viral genome of CHV encodes a 2942 amino acid (aa) polyprotein. it is predicted to be cleaved into 10 mature viral proteins. the virus displayed approximately 50% nucleotide sequence divergence from HCV. the binding site for miR-122 in the 5\u2032 UTR could not be identified in the CHV sequence. the mean time to the most recent common ancestor between the HCV genotypes and CHV was estimated to be between 500 and 1000 years before present (Ybp) geneBank accession numbers for representative strains are HCV-1a: NC_004102, NPHV: JQ434008, CHV: JF744991, CHV: JF744991, CHV: JF744991, CHV: JF744991, CHV: KC815310, RHV-1: KC411777, RHV-2: KC411784, RHV-3: KC796077 and BHV-D: antibodies in sera from different animals detected immunoreactivity against CHV NS3 in 36 samples of 103 horses (3%), with eight horse sera also carrying viral RNA. 80 dogs, 14 rabbits, 81 deer and 84 cows were seronegative, with one intermediate positive sample from a cow. only 22% of horses showed co-presence of IgG antibodies and viral genomes. this could be indicative for either an acute infection or would suggest that possibly the majority of equine hosts are able to clear NPHV infection. oct70 RHV-3 KC411806 SAR-3 KC411807 SAR-46 Bata BHV clade A KC796090 PDB-452 KC796091 PDB-445 BHV clade D KC796078 PDB-491.1 KC796074 PDB-829 Old World monkey GHV KC551800 GHV-1 BWC08 37 KC551801 GHV-1 BWC05 KC55 repeated samplings from one horse four and five months after the initial sampling revealed a persistent infection. the horse remained viremic, but the viral load decreased between the fourth and fifth months from the initial 4.8107 copies/mL to 2.1105 and 7.1104 copies/mL respectively. the complete genome of one RHV variant (RHV-339) and the nearly complete genome of another variant (RHV-098) were acquired from plasma samples originating from two different deer mice. the genome is predicted to encode a polyprotein of 2748 aa flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. the polyprotein is predicted to encode a polyprotein of 2748 aa flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs. the five sequenced genomes were predicted to encode a typical hepacivirus polyprotein comprising three structural and seven non-structural proteins of comparable size to those previously described for other hepaciviruses. the minimum aa identity of the novel rodent viruses to HCV averaged in the structural proteins between 15.1% and 31.3% and in the non-structural proteins from 16.3% to 42.2%. the Myodes hepaciviruses revealed the presence of antibodies against the NS3 antigens of these viruses in only some of the animals. RNA and antibodies were found in 3 of 57 (5.3%) PCR-positive bank vole sera. this low co-occurrence could indicate that bank voles might be able to clear hepacivirus infections in majority of cases. BHV serum levels ranged from 1.07105 to 3108 RNA copies/mL. BHV genomes encode a single positive-stranded RNA genome containing a single ORF, flanked at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 end by non-translated regions. most conserved regions were the NS3 and NS5B proteins. many different zoonotic viruses have been found to originate in bats. new research could shed new light on the role of these mammals as carriers of members of the Flaviviridae. hepaciviruses were all identified in non-primate species. a canonical miR-122 binding site was present in both GHV subtypes. the predicted cleavage sites of the GHV polyprotein are similar to other hepaciviruses. theses hepaciviruses contain their unusually long NS5A gene (882\u2013883 aa), approximately twice the length of any other known NS5A within the Flaviviridae. titers in most of the infected horses ranged from 107 to 108 genomes/mL. the viral genome contained a single ORF encoding a polyprotein of 3189 aa flanked by a 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR. the virus shares 35.5% aa identity with GBV-D, 20.5% identity with HCV (genotype 1) and 20.4% identity with NPHV. transmission between horses appears to be low as virus was undetectable. subclinical cases showed significantly elevated liver enzymes in serum. a slightly higher proportion of asymptomatic TDAV-positive animals were observed. sequence alignments revealed the divergence of EPgV from other pegiviruses. the most conserved regions were the NS3 and NS5B genes. highest sequence diversity can be found in the glycoproteins E1/E2 and NS4B.
