{"summary": "participants aged 65 and over completed interview-based questionnaires about chronotype, insomnia, depression, and anxiety. a small subset of subjects completed a 7-day sleep diary and actigraphy measurements. results were significantly negatively correlated with midpoint of sleep on free days assessed by the MCTQ. chronotype is defined as the sleep-wake time preference based on the individual\u2019s circadian rhythm. previous studies have found that an overall strong preference for eveningness tendencies is associated with higher severity of depression, insomnia and anxiety in all age groups [12-14]. previous studies have found that MSFsc is associated with DLMO [20,21], the melatonin secretion cycle [22], and MEQ scores [21,23,24]. in particular, Zavada et al. [23] found that the MCTQ is more accurate in examining the sleep-wake cycle than the MEQ. a small subset of participants (n=8) agreed to also complete sleep diaries and wear the actigraph for 7 days. participants were administered the Korean version of mini-Mental State Examination for dementia screening (MMSE-DS) [35] to screen for cognitive impairment. the ISI is a 7-item index developed by Bastien et al. [38] and assesses the severity of insomnia, satisfaction with current sleep, and worries about sleep problems during the last two weeks. a Korean version of the ISI has been validated in Korean samples [39]. all times measured by the Actiwatch2 were recorded in 2-minute epochs. data was processed automatically by Philips Actiware 6.0.5 (Philips Healthcare, Bend, OR, USA) software program. Statistical analysis Characteristics of demographic and clinical variables were analyzed. the subjective health status was scored from 1 (very healthy) to 5 points (very unhealthy), and the medical illness status was answered with disease or no disease. the Korean MCTQ measures various sleep parameters such as bed time (BT) and lights off (LO) on weekdays and free days. the ISI total score ranges from 0 to 28, with higher scores reflecting higher severity of insomnia symptoms. a Korean version of the ISI has been validated in Korean samples. the internal consistency in this sample was 0.83. the Korean MCTQ measures various sleep parameters such as bed time (BT) and lights off (LO) on weekdays and free days. participants who answered \u201cno\u201d to this question completed only to the free days portion on the MCTQ. the SGDS is a 15-item questionnaire that measures depressive symptoms in the elderly. total scores range from 0 to 15 and higher scores reflect higher depression severity. it measures state anxiety and consists of 20 items. operating characteristic curve analysis was conducted to propose a cut-off score for the MCTQ using MEQ scores. the mean age of participants was 72.314.58 (age range 65\u201388) years, with 75.1% (n=133) of the sample being female. -2.339* Subjective health status 2.580.98 2.72 0.79 -0.897 Medical illness status Yes 115 (65.7) 25 (14.3) 0.837 No 31 (17.7) 4 (2.3) BMI 23.332.79 23.032.77 -0.459 MSFsc 2.081.03 2.961.21 -4.335 ISI 5.825.02 8.934.60 -3.474* SGDS 3.213.23 3.893.39 -1.214 STAI 33 subjects who responded that they have a regular schedule on weekdays were analyzed in (B) MSW (2.530.75) distributions were normal in all variables, (A) MEQ_total (Z=1.153, p=0.140), (B) MSW (Z=0.842, p=0.478), (C) MSF (Z=0.896, p=0.398), and (D) MSFsc (Z=1.067, p=0.205), respectively MCTQ: Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, MSFsc: midpoint of sleep on free days corrected for sleep debt accumulated through weekdays. MSF was significantly correlated with ISI (r=0.27, p0.01), SGDS (r=0.27), and STAI-S (r=0.18, p0.05) scores. the optimal score of MSF and MSFsc was 2.83, the Youden\u2019s index of MSF was 0.44, and the Youden\u2019s index of MSFsc was 0.45, with 62.07% sensitivity and 83.11% specificity. we used MSF and MSFsc in ROC analysis to suggest a cut-off score of the MCTQ for the elderly. the mean age of participants was 72.314.58 (age range 65\u201388) years, with 75.1% (n=133) of the sample being female. 83.6% morning types (n=148) and 16.4% other types (n=29) in the current sample.

Pearson correlation analyses were conducted between MEQ scores and MCTQ parameters. a small group of participants (n=8), mid-sleep time on weekdays and free days (MSW, MSF) and MSFsc were calculated using sleep diaries and actigraphy. results indicated that MCTQ parameters were correlated with MSFsc of sleep diaries and actigraphy parameters. MCTQ: Munich ChronoType Questionnaire, MSFsc: midpoint of sleep on free days corrected for sleep debt accumulated through weekdays. MSFsc was significantly correlated with ISI (r=0.27, p0.01), SGDS (r=0.27), and STAI-S (r=0.18, p0.05) scores. the optimal score of MSF and MSFsc was 2.83, the Youden\u2019s index of MSF was 0.44, and the Youden\u2019s index of MSFsc was 0.45, with 62.07% sensitivity and 83.11% specificity. we used MSF and MSFsc in ROC analysis to suggest a cut-off score of the MCTQ for the elderly. this is consistent with previous studies that show that evening types are more common in younger adults, but there is a larger proportion of morning types in the elderly as sleep patterns are advanced with aging [26,47,48]. Specifically, decreased sensitivity of the retina and weakening of the suprachiasmatic nucleus lead to a decrease in light acceptance and changes in circadian rhythm [10,49,50] the correlation between the MCTQ and MSW was not significant in the MCTQ for Korean older adults. however, the correlation between the MEQ and MSW was not significant in the MCTQ for Korean older adults. some individuals grouped into other types in our study may have more eveningness tendencies than their counterparts with morning type, but display advanced sleep patterns due to sleep changes with aging. the current sample included the elderly who visit local community elderly centres. they engage in daily activities and have more social support, which may serve as a buffer against depression. decreased sensitivity of the retina and weakening of the suprachiasmatic nucleus lead to a decrease in light acceptance and changes in circadian rhythm. melatonin secretion and the amplitude of circadian rhythm decrease, many elderly report various sleep problems [11,51-53]. the correlation between the MEQ and MSW was not significant in the MCTQ for Korean older adults. we also sought to evaluate construct validity of the MCTQ with insomnia, depression, and anxiety. however, eveningness tendencies are still important and indicative of sleep and psychological disturbance. the current sample included the elderly who visit local community elderly centres. the elderly group requires clinical interventions for other types (intermediate and evening) compared to morning types."}
