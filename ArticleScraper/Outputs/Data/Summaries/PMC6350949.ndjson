{"summary": "participants were screened for signs of current illness or fever. no participants included in the current analysis reported ever having been infected with EBOV. 565 HCWs were consented and enrolled in the study. \u201cdirect contact\u201d was defined as any HCW who had direct contact with sick patients and included doctors, nurses, and traditional healers. \u201cUnlikely contact\u201d was defined as any HCW who had contact with sick patients and included positions such as hospital guards and administrators. a sample was classified as mildly reactive if the serum antibody concentration was >1.0 units/mL control calibrator, and reactive if the titer was >2.5 units/mL. VP40 Reactivity via Luciferase Immunoprecipitation System. EBOV GP\u2013bearing human immunodeficiency virus pseudotype viruses were generated as described previously [33], and pseudotype virus neutralization assays were performed [31, 34, 35]. serum from the patients had to at least neutralize approximately 50% of virus at a dilution of 1:50 compared to appropriate control. study included a sociodemographic and epidemiologic questionnaire and sample collection. blood specimens frozen, stored and tested were obtained from consenting participants by venipuncture into red-top Vacutainer tubes. after processing, aliquots of serum were frozen and stored at the Institut national de recherche biomedicale in Kinshasa.

VP40 reactivity was determined if the relative luciferase signal postimmunoprecipitation was at least 3 standard deviations greater than the background signal. a sample was classified as mildly reactive if the serum antibody concentration was >1.0 units/mL control calibrator, and reactive if the titer was >2.5 units/mL. for analysis, we only include those who were considered reactive (>2.5 units/mL). VP40 reactivity was determined if the relative luciferase signal postimmunoprecipitation was at least 3 standard deviations greater than the background signal. 370 (65.5%) were male and 195 (34.5%) were female. median age of HCWs was 40 years (interquartile range, 31.8\u201350 years) patient contact Direct 279 (50.1) 57 (20.4) 30 (10.8) 29 (10.4) 9 (6.3) 11 (7.7) 2 (1.4) 35\u201344 166 (29.6) 30 (18.1) 20 (12.0) 17 (10.2) 4 (2.4) 45\u201354 115 (20.5) 18 (15.7) 16 (13.9) 11 (9.6) 4 (3.4) 55 91 (16.2) 16 (17.6) 9 (9.9) 9 (9.9) 2 (2.2) males had a higher seroprevalence compared with females regardless of the test. males had a higher seroprevalence compared with females regardless of the test. males showed a significant difference for GP reactivity. cross workers had the highest VP40 seroprevalence and neutralizing capacity. those classified as having unlikely contacts with patients had the highest GP seroprevalence and neutralizing capacity. 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) Unlikely Driver 5 (5.2) 0 (0.0) 1 (20.0) 1 (20.0) 0 (0.0) Guard 21 (21.9) 6 (28.6) 2 (9.5) 0 (0.0) Maintenance 9 (9.4) 0 (0.0) 0 (0.0) GP and NP reactivity was determined as >2.5 units/mL. more than half (363 [64.2%]) of participants worked in a health facility, including the general hospital, health centers, and health posts. 61 (10.8%) reported working in other facilities. 141 (25.0%) did not identify working in any facility. hospital 92 (16.3) 11 (12.0) 7 (7.6) 6 (6.5) 3 (3.3) None 141 (25.0) 32 (22.7) 13 (9.2) 19 (13.5) 6 (4.3) Other 25 (4.4) 5 (20) 2 (8.0)a 5 (20.0)a 0 (0.0) Patient contact Direct 279 (50.1) 57 (20.4) 30 (10.8) 29 (10.4) 9 (3.2) Indirect 177 (31.8) 29 (16.4) 21 (11.9) 12 (6.8) 4 ( 8 of those who demonstrated neutralizing capacity (n = 16) presented both NP and VP40 reactivity (50.0%). only 3 HCWs were seroreactive for all 4 assays. 0 (0.0) Midwife 42 (15.3) 11 (26.2) 6 (14.3) 5 (11.9) 1 (2.4) Nurse 155 (56.4) 24 (15.5) 14 (9.0) 13 (8.4) 4 (2.6) Pastor 24 (8.7) 6 (25.0) 3 (12.5) 3 (12.5) 2 (8.3) Traditional healer 22 (8.0) 8 (36.4) 3 (13.6) 3 (13.6) 0 (0.0) Indirect communication 6 (3.1) 1 (16.7) 0 (0.0) 0 antibody titers measuring reactivity to EBOV nucleoprotein using ELISA. GP, glycoprotein; NP, nucleoprotein; VP40, Ebola virus matrix protein. serological survey conducted during EBOV outbreak found prevalence of 2.2% among health workers. ebolavirus entry lends itself to highly specific, but possibly insensitive detection of prior ebolavirus infection. 16 (2.8%) of HCWs who never reported infection were seroreactive for at least 1 serologic test. this includes 3 individuals who were seroreactive on all tests. we attempted to make our study population as diverse as possible by enrolling participants in both formal and informal settings. participants in both formal and informal settings may have been displaced from their normal facility to support the outbreak response. there may have been some misclassification of specific HCW occupations."}
