{"summary": "in 2015, the world health organization (WHO) recorded more than 150 outbreak reports from 36 countries across all the continents with Zika virus and MERS-CoV as the most commonly reported infections. the international health regulations (IHR) were designed to help the international community deal with the risk posed by emerging and reemerging infectious diseases. the country's disease surveillance systems have generally been passive, and managed by vertical programs. TB surveillance is paper based, data are collected by health-care providers and aggregated in monthly reports. disease surveillance has been a functional part of the public hygiene division of MSPP since 1975. between 1988 and 1991, MSPP implemented a Sentinel Surveillance Network, mainly for vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) the network was then expanded to cover all departments. specialized epidemiologic surveillance officers send weekly reports on the number of cases for 47 conditions, 14 of which are immediately reportable. cases are aggregated by sex, age group ( 5 years, 5 years), and morbidity/mortality status. theria probable Dengue suspect Neonatal tetanus Food poisoning Diabetes Other conditions Maternal death Epilepsy Pertussis suspect Measles/rubella suspect Febrile jaundice syndrome Prostate cancer Meningitis Fever of unknown origin Sexually transmitted diseases Plague suspect HIV confirmed Tetanus Vaccine-related event Human rabies Tuberculosis positive Hypertension HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. from 2010 to 2015, the yearly cumulative reported number of cases of all diseases under surveillance has steadily increased from just over 200,000 to more than 1.6 million. on average, 60% of reported cases of all diseases are female and 30% are 5 years of age. twelve new assistant epidemiologists were hired to oversee VPD surveillance and work closely with surveillance officers and the departmental epidemiologists. significant progress has been made in meeting performance indicators as required for the ongoing certification of measles and congenital rubella elimination. daily reports of new cases, hospitalized cases, and deaths aggregated by age groups were sent from cholera treatment facilities all over the country. from October 2010 to December 2015, there were 763,842 suspected cholera cases, of which 107,192 were in children less than 5 years old. influx of resources postearthquake and introduction of cholera also helped MSPP in April 2012 launch laboratory-enhanced surveillance. the national laboratory played a critical role from the onset of the cholera epidemic by identifying Vibrio cholerae within a few days of the first case report. cholera was the main cause of diarrhea among sampled patients 5 years or older and under 5 years old. rotavirus was the second most common pathogen in children under 5 with diarrhea. 2014 2015 Acute respiratory infections 28,019 (13.0%) 49,769 (7.3%) 65,974 (7.5%) 89,886 (8.4%) 112,690 (8.2%) 126,336 (7.5%) Fever 45,730 (21.3%) 84,364 (12.4%) 116,808 (13.3%) 138,107 (12.8%) 194,601 (14.1%) 162,042 (13.2%) Diarrhea 21,023 (9.8%) PRESEPI 2012\u20132015 Specimen Test Received Tested Positive Haemophilus influenzae Streptococcus pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis CSF PCR 139 139 26 (18.7%) 11 (7.9%) 15 (10.8%) 0 (0.0%) Stool Culture Cholera Shigella Salmonella 5 3,596 704 214 (30.4%) 202 (29.0%) 9 (1.3%) 3 (1.2%) 5 2,423 2, since 2012, data on the etiology and pathogen-specific burden of key infectious disease syndromes have enabled MSPP and other public health policy decision-makers to set evidence-based priorities for optimal use of limited resources. these data will be useful for the evaluation of public health interventions such as the introduction of the rotavirus vaccine in 2014, the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, scheduled for 2018. the national laboratory has already developed partnerships with the relevant regional laboratory (Caribbean Public Health Agency) and reference laboratories (e.g., CDC-Atlanta) the national laboratory is working on implementing in-country regional laboratories that will greatly improve the laboratory component of the surveillance system. since 1975, MSPP has implemented surveillance systems in the country. fluctuating donor funding and lack of substantial governmental financial investment have always threatened, and sometimes disrupted, the stability of these systems."}
