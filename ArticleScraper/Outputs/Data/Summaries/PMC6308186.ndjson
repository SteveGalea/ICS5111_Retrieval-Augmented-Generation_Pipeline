{"summary": "acute lung injury (ALI) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in critically ill patients. neutrophil quantification and pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations were markedly reduced in the lung-protective ventilatory strategy. the influenza virus infection recruits large amounts of neutrophils. NETs may also be linked to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) NETs are single-stranded viruses. dsRNA virus-associated ALI was involved in the TLR3/p38 MAPK signaling pathway and the aberrant expression of claudin-5. NETs may be potential targets in the therapy of dsRNA virus-associated ALI. mice were anesthetized with an intraperitoneal injection of a mixture of ketamine and xylazine (10 mg/kg) a DNase I (Roche, 11284932001), MPO inhibitor (4-ABH, sigma, A41909), TLR3 inhibitor (Merck, 614310) or p38 inhibitor (SB203580, Selleck) was dissolved in DMSO and administered via an IP injection, 2 h before the inoculation of poly I:C. a catheter was inserted into the trachea by way of an injected opening located in the cervical part the cells in the BALF were blocked with anti-CD16/CD32 (BioLegend, 101302) to reduce non-specific binding at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. anti-Gr-1 conjugated with APC (BioLegend, 108412), anti-F4/80 conjugated with FITC (eBioscience, 11-4801-81), and anti-CD4 conjugated with PE (eBioscience, 12-0042-85) were added to label neutrophils, macro amplification conditions were 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, followed by 40 cycles of thermal cycling at 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 45 s. quantitative PCR assays were conducted in triplicate for each sample and performed using the 2-Ct method. slides were blocked with 5% goat serum (Gibco, 16210-064) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. sections were washed with PBS and stained with myeloperoxidase antibody. sections were rinsed again and mounted with glycerol. western blotting The lower right lung lobes were removed and stored in liquid nitrogen for protein analysis. the protein concentration in the supernatants was measured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. all experimental animals used in this study were maintained under a protocol 1709011 and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Nanjing Medical University. the acute lung injury model was established as described previously. DMSO administration was set as the treatment control. mice were anesthetized via an IP injection of a mixture of ketamine (200 mg/kg) and xylazine (10 mg/kg) a catheter was inserted into the trachea by way of an injected opening located in the cervical part. the airways were washed three times with a total of 1.0 ml PBS. anti-CD4 conjugated with PE were added to label neutrophils, macrophages and CD4+ lymphocytes at 37\u00b0C for 30 min in darkness. amplification conditions were 1 cycle at 50\u00b0C for 2 min, 1 cycle at 95\u00b0C for 30 s. 40 cycles of thermal cycling at 95\u00b0C for 5 s and 60\u00b0C for 45 s. primer sequences shown as follows: IL-1, upper: 5\u2032-AGCTCTCCACCTCAATGGA-3\u2032; lower: 5\u2032-TTGCTTGGGATCCACACTCT-3\u2032; IL-6, upper: 5\u2032-GACTGATGCTGGTGACAACC-3\u2032; (3) TNF-, upper: 5\u2032-GGTGAGCAAGAGATTG-3\u2032; (3) T anti-Histone H3 (citrulline R2 + R8 + R17) at 4\u00b0C overnight in darkness. the sections were gently washed with PBS, followed by incubation with the secondary antibodies. the sections were rinsed again and mounted with glycerol. supernatants were measured using a bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Beyotime) equal amounts of protein were loaded in 10% SDS\u2013PAGE. then the proteins were transferred to polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. after washing with PBST, the membranes were finally incubated with the appropriate secondary antibody for 1 h at room temperature. poly I:C induced NETs in ALI may be associated with elevated inflammatory cytokines, aberrant claudin-5 and the p38 MAPK pathway. flow cytometry analysis indicated that neutrophils, but not macrophages, were significantly increased in the BALF. neutrophils were the major producer of extracellular traps in poly I:C induced acute lung injury. neutrophils rather than macrophages were the major producer of extracellular traps in poly I:C induced acute lung injury. infiltration of inflammatory cells and interstitial edema in the lung lobe was reduced in the ALI model mice with neutrophil depletion, bar = 100 m; (B-1) cells were counted in the BALF, p 0.05; (B-2) protein concentration in the BALF, p 0.05; (C) flow cytometry analysis of the BALF cells, p 0.05; (D) inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and infiltration of inflammatory cells and interstitial edema in the lung lobe was reduced in the ALI model mice upon DNase treatment, bar = 100 m; (B-1) cells were counted in the BALF, p 0.05; (B-2) protein concentration in the BALF, p 0.05; (B-3) neutrophil elastase (NE) activity was evaluated in the BALF, p 0.05; (C) flow cytometry analysis of the BA 4-ABH almost eradicated the NETs, suggesting the pivotal role of MPO in poly I:C-induced NETs. infiltration of inflammatory cells and interstitial edema in the lung lobe decreased in the ALI mice treated with an MPO inhibitor. DPI significantly reduced neutrophils infiltration and IL-1 in the lung. the role of poly I:C-induced NETs in ALI was NADPH dependent. the role of poly I:C-induced NETs in ALI was NADPH. NET formation in the BALF was almost eradicated upon TLR3 inhibitor administration. the levels of neutrophil infiltration in the BALF and IL-1 in the lung were significantly decreased. the role of poly I:C-induced NETs in ALI was TLR3 dependent. mice were treated with the p38 inhibitor SB203580. the p38 inhibitor reduced the production of NETs in the BALF. p38 inhibitor partially recovered the expression of claudin-5. elastase activity was increased in the BALF for the mice inoculated with poly I:C. addition of poly I:C led to an increase in the inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in the lung. inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in the lung were quantified using qRT-PCR. NETs were observed and quantified in lung tissues from mice administered poly I:C. neutrophils were the major producer of extracellular traps in poly I:C. infiltration of inflammatory cells and interstitial edema in the lung lobe was reduced in the ALI model mice with neutrophil depletion, bar = 100 m; (B-1) cells were counted in the BALF, p 0.05; (B-2) protein concentration in the BALF, p 0.05; (B-3) neutrophil elastase (NE) activity was evaluated in the BALF, p 0.05; (C) flow cytometry analysis of DNase I treatment significantly reduced the formation of NETs. infiltration of inflammatory cells and interstitial edema in the lung lobe was reduced in the ALI model mice upon DNase treatment. IL-1 in the lung was significantly decreased in the 4-ABH treated mice. 4-ABH almost eradicated the NETs (Figure 4E) protein concentration and NETs in the BALF were significantly decreased. the role of poly I:C-induced NETs in ALI was NADPH dependent. inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in the lung were quantified. NET formation in the lung was almost eradicated upon TLR3 inhibitor administration. NET formation in the BALF was almost eradicated. NET formation in the lung was significantly reduced. p38 inhibitor SB203580 decreased production of NETs in the BALF. also reduced neutrophil infiltration in the BALF and suppressed NETs in the lung. p38 inhibitor partially recovered expression of claudin-5. influenza virus (H1N1 (Narasaraju et al., 2011), H5N1 (Sun et al., 2012), H9N2 (Li et al., 2016) may even induce deadly ALI and ARDS. it is not clear if viral replication or viral components (nucleic acids or proteins) are responsible for ALI and ARDS. degrades DNA, was indicated to be effective at eradicating NETs in vivo. we injected DNase I via the tail vein to break pulmonary NETs. tracheal instillation with excessive liquid and air could cause pulmonary edema and emphysema. p38 MAPK is one of the downstream molecules of the TLR3 signaling pathway. p38 inhibitor reduced the formation of NETs and increased expression of tight junction protein claudin-5. roles of p38 and its inhibitor were controversial in swine influenza virus-induced ALI. the experiments were conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
