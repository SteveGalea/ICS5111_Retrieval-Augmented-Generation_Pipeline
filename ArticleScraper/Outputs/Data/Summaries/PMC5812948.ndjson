{"summary": "EMS personnel are up to seven times more likely to sustain a physical or mental injury in the workplace than national averages (1, 2). health care-associated infections (HAIs) are infections acquired within a health care setting that affect approximately 7% of hospitalized patients in developed countries. review highlights efficacy of cleaning practices for mitigating pathogen spread. review highlights need for more rigorous investigation of pathogen biosafety risks. EMS pathogen monitoring studies. i) Study designs and methodologies. studies vary significantly in their scope and sampling strategies in terms of number (and type of vehicles) examined, the location of sampling areas, the total number of samples collected, and the frequency of sample collection. some studies examined pathogen persistence at a single time point (8) or over one or more weeks (7), months (21), or an entire year (22). coliforms, Corynebacterium sp., Corynebacterium sp., Micrococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Staphylococcus aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus viridans 1.4%, S. aureus; 2.7%, S. viridans; 61%, various bacteria 2003 22 Germany 89 transportation events MRSA 8/89 transportation events ( phylococcus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Escherichia coli, Aspergillus sp., Bacillus sp. 6/7 samples (86%), Staphylococcus sp.; 2/7 samples (29%), Pseudomonas sp. 2006 7 Australia 2 helicopters (5 areas) MSSA, S. epidermidis 19/60 samples (32%), MSSA (no potential pathogens or opportunistic pathogens are in bold. number of vehicles or samples testing positive for contamination/total number of samples tested (%), or % of total samples.

PCR (11, 27), pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (13, 18, 20), and/or mass spectrometry techniques (27) were also employed to provide additional strain information and/or determine antibiotic resistance status. all studies identified similar environmental (nonpathogenic) bacterial flora. only two studies have specifically investigated air ambulances for pathogen contamination. one study identified several opportunistic pathogens in a rotor wing air ambulance, including Pseudomonas sp., Aspergillus, and E. coli (7). a second study of EMS helicopters detected only MSSA and nonpathogenic skin flora. in all published reports, more than 50 locations have been examined for the presence of pathogens within or on ambulance vehicles or equipment. however, not all sampling locations were examined or available for testing in all studies. commonly touched areas on medical devices, such as blood pressure cuffs (10, 24), cardiac monitors (10, 14) and intravenous equipment (10, 14) also showed elevated levels of MRSA. no significant differences were observed in the composition of the detected microbe community between the inside and outside of the ambulance. total bacterial and fungal counts increased slightly but significantly (P = 0.005 to 0.030) during patient transport events. the increase in total bacterial and fungal counts in air samples was positively correlated with an increase in surface swab counts. strains that were genetically related to samples collected from EMS facilities included both HA-MRSA and CA-MRSA (USA300) isolates. additional studies are needed to determine whether these findings are representative of EMS personnel in other countries. cleaning practices and pathogen mitigation strategies vary in their adopted cleaning practices for managing biological hazards. septic produced moderate to heavy growth of S. aureus at most sampling locations and occasional light growth of E. coli, Pseudomonas spp. and Gram-negative Bacillus spp. health care uniforms have been implicated as a fomite for HAI transmission in hospitals. one study investigated bacterial colonization rates of 30 EMS personnel uniforms before and after cleaning with detergents containing acetic peroxide (26) the hands of health care workers are also thought to be the most prominent mechanism for the transmission of HAIs (41). culture conditions are biased and permit the detection of only one or a few organisms (16, 21, 23) culturing methods also have long turnaround times for results (48 to 96 h), limiting the time frame in which microbial contamination may be detected. extensive biochemical testing, microscopy, and use of selective media may still misidentify microbes (42) or provide only coarse-grained identification. PCR is the most widely used DNA amplification technique. it uses specific oligonucleotide primers to exponentially amplify one or more gene sequences of interest from a DNA sample. the ability of PCR-based methods to detect pathogens depends largely on target gene(s) chosen for amplification. amplicon sequencing is the direct analysis of the PCR-amplified DNA (i.e., 16S rRNA gene), providing taxonomical and phylogenetic insight into the diversity of the microbial community present. the information gained by amplicon sequencing is defined by the preceding PCR and therefore is subject to the limitations and biases described above. if implemented, LFIAs could enable rapid and inexpensive detection of pathogens in EMS environments with turnaround times as low as $1.00 per test. DNA sequencing and paper-based detection approaches could be combined to create a powerful two-part pathogen detection system. the two-step approach would enable customizable and site-specific monitoring of pathogens in the EMS workplace. no single disinfection method is expected to eliminate all biological hazards or is suitable for all types of surfaces. achieving optimal decontamination of EMS vehicles depends on complex combination of factors. additional technologies that rapidly identify pathogens and quantitate biological loads are needed. ambulances (7, 21), EMS stations (17\u201319), EMS medical devices (12, 28), uniforms (26), or EMS personnel (11, 13, 15, 16, 18, 20) for pathogen colonization. some studies examined pathogen persistence at a single time point (8) or over one or more weeks (7), months (21), or an entire year (22).

also, Danish, Saudi Arabian, and most Asian studies reported no incidence of MRSA (27, 28, 30, 32). the united states is predicted to have a greater burden of MRSA than some northern European countries (35). an Arizona study found approximately 7% (11/160) of sampled sites at an EMS facility tested positive for MRSA (17), and two other studies conducted in Washington also showed similar MRSA contamination frequencies of 4.1% (44/1,060 samples) and 8% (52/653 samples) (18, 19) 106 air samples and 452 surface swabs were taken from 30 ground ambulances in Thailand. the increase in total bacterial and fungal counts in air samples was positively correlated with an increase in surface swab counts. most studies report MRSA colonization frequencies for EMS personnel that are approximately three to four times higher than that reported for the general population (1.5%) (37), suggesting that EMS workers are at greater risk for infection during an epidemic (38) and that pathogen risk exposure may be exacerbated by improper workplace practices or patient handling. an initial set of swab samples was collected after removing loose material with a cloth and applying Staphene or KleenAseptic. samples taken after subsequent cleaning with Virkon showed only light growth for one sampling location (stretcher) (7). some sites showed increased contamination by the opportunistic pathogens S. aureus and Pseudomonas sp. after cleaning, suggesting that the employed cleaning practices were insufficient for decontamination. the practice of effective decontamination procedures may also differ in different EMS operating modes. implementing mandatory hand washing practices for EMS personnel is likely a simple but effective measure to reduce HAI risks in the EMS environment. no study has reported on the prevalence of many other clinically important pathogens in the EMS environment. culture-based detection can demonstrate viability, antibiotic resistance, and hemolytic capability. turing step may be circumvented by sequencing DNA from environmental samples. additional strain information from sequencing can be used to identify patterns of pathogen spread and/or reservoirs within and outside the health care framework (47). portable DNA sequencing technologies, such as the MinION device, are particularly interesting, as they can allow DNA sequencing to be performed on-site in EMS vehicles. amplicon sequencing is the direct analysis of the PCR-amplified DNA (i.e., 16S rRNA gene), providing taxonomical and phylogenetic insight into the diversity of the microbial community present. metagenomic sequencing involves the shearing of all collected DNA into small fragments, which are then independently sequenced (50). however, due to the volume and complexity of the data collected, the metagenomic analysis is computationally intensive. paper-based tests, such as lateral flow immunoassays, are another alternative for on-site identification of pathogens. lateral flow immunoassays (LFIAs) use specific antibodies or nucleic acid probes to detect one or more molecules or organisms in a sample. if implemented, LFIAs could enable rapid and inexpensive detection of pathogens in EMS environments with turnaround times as low 15 to 30 min for as little as $1.00 per test. only approximately 25 published studies have investigated pathogen prevalence and efficacy of cleaning practices within the EMS framework. no data on pathogen prevalence in EMS exists from most other developed countries, including Canada and Mexico. the issue of insufficient time or resources for adequate vehicle cleaning is a recurring theme.
