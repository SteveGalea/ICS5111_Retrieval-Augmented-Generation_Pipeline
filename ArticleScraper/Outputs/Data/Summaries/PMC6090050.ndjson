{"summary": "HRV-A and HRV-B were discovered in the 1950s. HRV-C was identified using molecular techniques in 2006. a total of 168 HRV genotypes (80 HRV-A, 32 HRV-B and 56 HRV-C) are recognized. HRV-C is more frequently associated with wheezing episodes, asthma exacerbations, and lower respiratory tract infections compared with HRV-A and -B (Linsuwanon et al., 2009; Gern, 2010; Bizzintino et al., 2011). however, there is no relationship between disease severity and HRV species. the criteria of hospitalized patient inclusion were: sudden onset of fever >38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat and difficulty breathing. additional criteria were a normal or low leukocyte count, or lower chest wall indrawing. all NPA samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. all PCR products of 15 common respiratory viruses were confirmed by sequencing. age, maximum body temperature, laboratory parameters, clinical features, and HRV prevalence were compared by 2-test or Fisher\u2019s exact test for categorical variables. the criteria of hospitalized patient inclusion were: sudden onset of fever >38\u00b0C and cough or sore throat and difficulty breathing. additional criteria were a normal or low leukocyte count, or lower chest wall indrawing. metapneumovirus (hMPV), human bocavirus (HBoV) and human coronavirus 229E/OC43/NL63/HKU1 were confirmed by sequencing. all PCR products of 15 common respiratory viruses were confirmed by sequencing. human rhinovirus infected significantly more males than females. the detection frequency of HRV-A was significantly lower in patients aged 5\u20139 years (P = 0.008). HRV-B was detected year-round at similar frequencies in all seasons. Detection of HRV-untyped peaked in summer and spring 2014 and was at a low level thereafter. clinical characteristics of patients with HRV infections in the study. 131 (46.8%) were co-infected\u2014102 with one other virus, 21 with two other viruses, and 8 with three other viruses. the patients with co-infections did not have more serious disease. 2 Virus (N = 102) 3 Viruses (N = 21) 4 Viruses (N = 8) HRV+ADV 36 HRV+ADV+HBoV 7 HRV+ADV+HBoV+HCoV 2 HRV+HBoV+hRSV 3 HRV+PIV+HBoV+ENV 1 HRV+hRSV 16 HRV+ADV+hRSV 2 HRV+PIV+ADV+ENV 1 HRV the median age was 1 year (range: 10 days to 15 years) HRV was detected in 280 (27.9%) of 1,003 specimens. the detection rates of HRV-A and -B differed significantly (P 0.001). human rhinovirus infected significantly more males than females. HRV-B was not detected in those aged 3\u20134 years. the detection frequency of HRV-A was significantly lower in patients aged 5\u20139 years. clinical characteristics of patients with HRV infections are listed in Table 2. fever, cough, gasping, cyanosis, and diarrhea were the most common symptoms. there was no significant difference in clinical symptoms according to HRV species. 131 (46.8%) were co-infected\u2014102 with one other virus, 21 with two other viruses, and 8 with three other viruses. most such co-infections involved AdV, HBoV, and RSV. 280 (27.9%) were positive for HRV (HRV-A, 50.0%; HRV-B, 7.5%; HRV-C, 20%; and HRV-untyped, 22.5%). this prevalence of HRV-untyped is higher than in a recent study in Chongqing (13%) we detected 77 HRV genotypes in Shanghai from 2013 to 2015. the predominant HRV-A genotypes were A-78, A-12, A-89, and A-61. those of HRV-B were B-70, B-86, and B-97. the predominant HRV-C genotypes were C-2, C-6, C-24, and C-16. human rhinovirus circulated throughout this 2-year study with peaks in winter 2013 and autumn 2014. HRV-A was detected most frequently in those 5 years old, while the frequency of detection of HRV-B and -C did not differ by age. nearly half (46.8%) of the HRV-positive patients were co-infected with other respiratory viruses, most frequently ADV, HBoV, and hRSV. further research is necessary to demonstrate the dominant virus by qPCR positive with CT value and impact on disease severity."}
