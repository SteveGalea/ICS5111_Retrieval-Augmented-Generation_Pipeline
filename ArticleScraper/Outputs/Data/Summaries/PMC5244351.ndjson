{"summary": "palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of a 16-carbon fatty acid via a thioester bond primarily to a cysteine residue side chain of a protein. the increased hydrophobicity resulting from palmitoylation promotes the association of a protein with lipid membranes. cellular proteins use palmitoylation as a mechanism to regulate their localization and function (3\u20136) the polyprotein CP-E3-E2-6K-E1 is translated, and the E1 protein is not translated. the 6K and TF proteins have identical N-terminal domains but unique C-terminal domains. TF is predominantly incorporated into released virus particles. recombinant viruses lacking both 6K and TF (6K) or only TF (6K only or TF) or unpalmitoylated mutants negatively impact the infectious and total virus output from infected host cells compared to the wild type (WT) the Cys mutants were able to produce infectious virus. but examination of the virions showed that the Cys mutants had morphological abnormalities. we propose a model for the role of TF palmitoylation in alphavirus budding. the 6K and TF proteins and their Cys residues were mutated. in 5C, the five shared Cys residues in the portion of 6K and TF were mutated. the blue regions are sequences shared between both 6K and TF isoforms. the TF Cys mutants 9C, 4C, and 5C are shown below the WT sequence. the blue regions on the left are sequences shared between 6K and TF isoforms. the red regions to the right are unique to the C terminus of TF. TF and 6K protein expression in infected cells were analyzed by Western blotting at 8 and 16 hpi, using the virus CP protein as a loading control. the 6K protein was also detected by Western blotting with antibodies directed against an N-terminal epitope called anti-6K/TF. the 9C and 4C mutants have a ratio of 6K to TF much closer to 1. 5C has an elevated level of 6K compared to that of TF. only the N-terminal Cys residues of TF are palmitoylated. a significant enrichment of palmitoylated protein was observed in virus-infected samples. the CP protein which is known not to be palmitoylated, there was no enrichment of biotinylated protein. a comparison of the left and right panels of Fig. 3A indirectly addresses TF palmitoylation and suggests that palmitoylation occurs in the shared N-terminal residues common between the WT and 4C rather than on the C-terminal Cys residue. the uppermost band is present in all samples, including the mock-infected sample Identical experiments were performed at 8 hpi, with similar results. if 6K is palmitoylated, it is palmitoylated at very low levels. infected BHK cells were labeled with palmitic azide from 12 to 16 hpi. infected BHK lysates were treated with hydroxylamine (HA) to remove palmitoyl moieties. a representative blot from at least three repetitions is shown. we used dual-color detection to probe for palmitoylation and TF simultaneously. the 9C and 5C TF bands shifted their migration to a lower molecular weight, confirming that they were palmitoylated. the hydroxylamine-treated WT and 4C TF bands did not shift upon hydroxylamine treatment, indicating that there is no palmitoylation in the C terminus of TF. we did not detect any lower-molecular-weight bands that might correspond to the unmodified TF protein in the WT or the 4C our work is consistent with previous studies suggesting that TF is palmitoylated at residues at the N terminus (which includes C35, C36, and C39) the observation that the Cys mutants have different steady-state levels of 6K and TF over time. in the presence of cycloheximide, TF and 6K protein levels in 4C and the WT decreased at similar rates. the decreasing levels of TF are most likely explained by degradation via the proteasome or proteases. however, the level of the CP protein, which is budded from the cell at a higher ratio per particle, did not substantially decrease within the same time frame. infected-cell fractions at 16 hpi were probed by Western blotting for virus proteins. similar results were obtained at least three times. the bars represent the signal in the plasma membrane fractions. the TF doublet was maintained both in the organelle membrane protein fraction and at the plasma membrane. 9C and 5C TFs were detected at very low levels at the plasma membrane despite being present in the organelle membrane fraction. the highest level of detection was found for 4C 6K. a representative graph with two biological replicates is shown. we purified the virus and probed for the glycoproteins, CP, TF, and 6K. the TF protein, but not the 6K protein, was detected in virions by Western blotting. the 9C and 4C mutants produced 1 log unit less infectious virus than the WT at all times. the 5C mutant produced 2 log units less infectious particles than the WT until 12 hpi. by 24 h, all the host cells were dead, 5C produced the same number of infectious particles as the WT. in 9C, 4C, and 5C, all nine Cys residues in the Sindbis virus TF protein were mutated. in 5C, the five shared Cys residues in the portion of 6K and TF prior to the slip site were mutated. the protein length is given in amino acids. the blue regions are sequences shared between 6K and TF isoforms. the dark blue and red regions are unique to the C terminus of TF. mutations made for constructing the TF Cys mutants 9C, 4C, and 5C are demonstrated below the WT sequence. the 5C TF protein band migrates at the same position as 9C. a single palmitoyl moiety is 250 Da. other small posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation, are commonly detected as shifted bands by gel electrophoresis. the ratio of total 6K to TF protein in the cell has a ratio close to 10:1. the 9C and 4C mutants have a ratio of 6K to TF much closer to 1, and 5C has an elevated level of 6K compared to that of TF. only the N-terminal Cys residues of TF are palmitoylated. lysate proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and probed separately for the biotin-palmitic azide modification and viral proteins via Western blotting. for the CP protein which is known not to be palmitoylated, there was no enrichment of biotinylated protein. this method specifically labels palmitoylated proteins. if the signal in the biotin blot corresponds to 6K, there should be a higher-intensity band for WT, 4C, and 6K* infections but not for mock, 9C, or 5C infection. if 6K is palmitoylated, it is palmitoylated at very low levels. infected lysates were treated with hydroxylamine (HA) to remove palmitoyl moieties. in the WT and the 4C mutant, there is a biotin signal that exactly corresponds with the position of TF migration in the dual-color channel overlay. amine catalyzes the hydrolysis of the thioester linkages between the Cys residue and the palmitate group. treatment with hydroxylamine will result in a downward shift in the migration of 6K and TF on a gel. the 9C and 5C TF bands did not shift upon hydroxylamine treatment, indicating that there is no palmitoylation in the C terminus of TF. previous work showed that in Sindbis virus, residues C35, C36, and C39 in 6K are palmitoylated in chicken embryo fibroblasts (20, 23) the authors of that study also identified another smaller 4.2K band that was not palmitoylated. protein turnover does not account for higher levels of 6K or TF. 4C TF protein levels increased, but the amount of 4C TF was larger at all times measured, consistent with the data shown in Fig. 2A. in contrast, the 6K protein signal in the WT did not change dramatically over the period of treatment with only the DMSO vehicle. in the presence of cycloheximide, TF and 6K protein levels in 4C and the WT decreased at similar rates. Western blots on mock-infected cell lysates probed for virus proteins. similar results were obtained at least three times. localization of TF to the plasma membrane is dependent on its N-terminal palmitoylation. the KDEL signal is a retrieval motif found in ER-resident proteins. it is enriched in the organellar fraction but not in the plasma membrane fraction. at both times, the WT TF doublet was maintained both in the organelle membrane protein fraction and at the plasma membrane. the main defect observed was striking internal staining indicative of particles that had compromised structural integrity. TEM purified the virus and probed for the glycoproteins, CP, TF, and 6K. TF proteins were not present at high levels at the cell surface, nor were they detectable in virions. the palmitoylation state of TF modulates its transport to the plasma membrane, thereby indirectly affecting the amount of TF that is incorporated into the released virion particle. hepatitis C virus relies on palmitoylation for association with ER membranes. a driving force behind this study was to characterize the regulatory mechanisms governing the functions of proteins that participate in budding. all sequenced alphavirus species encode the small membrane protein isoforms 6K and TF, which are palmitoylated and positively affect budding (70, 71). Initially, we hypothesized that alternative palmitoylation states between 6K and TF would provide a physical explanation for how the TF protein, and not 6K, is usually incorporated into alphavirus particles at low stoichiometric levels (20, 24, 26, 30, 31) in 5C, the C terminus can still theoretically regulate palmitoylation levels. but there are no Cys residues to be modified, so 5C is not transported to the plasma membrane. in other alphaviruses lacking these C-terminal Cys residues, there are likely other features of the cytoplasmic tail or alternate regulatory mechanisms. TF synthesis can be investigated by using mutants with altered levels of TF. the original studies that investigated the 6K protein were reported in the early 1990s (20, 23) it has been inferred that the 4.2K protein band corresponds to the 6K protein. in the past, 6K was best resolved on high-percentage-acrylamide gels with urea (23) the TF protein is present as two populations of differentially palmitoylated proteins. the TF doublet is maintained even in the presence of reducing agent, ruling out alternate disulfide bonding between Cys residues. 6K and TF proteins localize differently, with TF localizing to the plasma membrane and in a position to participate in budding. in vivo experiments using tissue culture showed that 6K and TF mutants cause disease that is less severe than that caused by the WT. cytoplasmic and transmembrane structural proteins use palmitoylation as a mechanism to achieve or enhance membrane association during budding. in hepatitis C virus, palmitoylation in the core protein that encapsulates the genome has been reported to increase its association with ER membranes. model where palmitoylation regulates TF localization, controlling its participation in budding. all sequenced alphavirus species encode the small membrane protein isoforms 6K and TF, which are palmitoylated and positively affect budding. palmitoylation on TF targets the protein to the plasma membrane, where it participates in the assembly and budding of WT particles. in 4C, TF is shuttled to the plasma membrane, because N-terminal Cys residues are palmitoylated. in 5C, the C terminus can still theoretically regulate palmitoylation levels, but there are no Cys residues to be modified. TF is still targeted to the plasma membrane by N-terminal palmitoylation, as in 4C and 9C. another possible role for the TF C-terminal domain is self-feedback that regulates its own frameshifting rate. a double mutant was mutated at Cys39, and another virus was mutated at Cys39. it is important to note that the presence of TF (which has 4 additional Cys residues) was not known at the time of those studies. some studies on 6K and TF have been difficult to pursue for other alphaviruses. 6K migrates as a single band in the WT and not a doublet like TF. size of the 6K protein also becomes smaller in the 5C and 9C mutants. there is no clear signal for modified 6K with palmitic azide labeling. 6K is a virus with three silent nucleotide mutations at the frameshift slip site (U UUU UUA to G UUC CUA) that abolish frameshifting and, hence, TF production. the three Cys mutant strains are 9C, with mutations of all 9 Cys residues to Ser residues. TF C46S causes an A46L mutation in the 6K/TF reading frame. TF C59S causes an A4L mutation in the E1 reading frame. oligonucleotides in this study were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) two peptides were synthesized, with the sequences ETFTETMSYLWSC and RLPGEGRRLRTC. the full peptides were created according to typical solid-phase synthesis procedures and techniques. oc-protected amino acid, DEPBT, N,N-ethyldiisopropylamine and dimethyl fluoride were added to the growing peptide chain. after all amino acids were added, the peptide chain was washed with DMF and dichloromethane (DCM) the peptides were purified via lyophilization. infectious viruses were generated from a cDNA clone, similar to previous descriptions.
