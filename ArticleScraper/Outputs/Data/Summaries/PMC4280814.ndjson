{"summary": "the 3rd isirv Antiviral Group conference on influenza and other respiratory virus infections: Advances in Clinical Management. attracted 188 clinicians, public health specialists and medical scientists from 34 countries to present their recent research. the programme focused on the latest advances in the mitigation and clinical management of influenza and other respiratory virus disease. as of may 22, 2014, there have been 446 confirmed H7N9 cases in china resulting in 163 deaths. the cases have occurred mainly during two waves (weeks 8\u201318, 2013 and week 40, 2013 \u2013 week 20, 2014) of which 85% had prior exposure to poultry or contaminated live poultry markets. the median time from poultry exposure to disease onset was 5 days. pre-existing medical conditions occurred in >60% of these cases. the prominent clinical features on admission were those of a severe influenza syndrome with fever, cough, fatigue and dyspnoea. two patients with severe H7N9 infection requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) also received systemic corticosteroid treatment leading to treatment failure and a poor clinical outcome. replication and transmission of H7N9 viruses containing the R292K NA mutation have been shown to be comparable to those of wild-type H7N9 viruses in guinea pigs. early initiation of oseltamivir was particularly effective in reducing mortality in H5N1 patients without respiratory failure. those requiring ventilatory support at the time of oseltamivir initiation were more likely to die. one human case of avian H5N6 was recently detected in china. a prospective cohort study in 2013\u20132014 found that influenza-like illness (ILI) was detected in 179% of pregnant women, of whom the majority tested positive for influenza A, with substantially lower influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus infection. the influenza burden in children in a rural Indian community was found to be substantial with 116% of ILI cases being caused by influenza A or B viruses. zanamivir and laninamivir each represented 40% of NAIs used. zanamivir (15%) and peramivir (5%) use was considerably less. zanamivir and laninamivir each represented 40% of NAIs used. a late 2013 cluster of H1N1pdm09 viruses containing the H275Y substitution was detected in 38 (39%) of 97 H1N1pdm09 viruses from community patients not receiving NAIs in Sapporo, Japan. this reminiscent of a similar cluster of oseltamivir-resistant H1N1pdm09 viruses in community patients in australia in 2011. a range of new adamantane derivatives have good antiviral activity in vitro and in animal models against H1N1pdm09 and H3N2 viruses that contain the S31N M2 ion channel substitution that confer resistance to amantadine. Favipiravir is a novel pyrazinamide molecule that inhibits replication of various RNA viruses, including influenza types A, B and C. fludase (DAS-181) is a host-targeted therapeutic agent that removes sialic acid from cellular receptors in the respiratory tract. a single administration 7 days pre-infection resulted in the protection of 80\u2013100% of mice from lethal H7N9 challenge. studies have used the control test negative design approach to estimate IVE during early and late influenza seasons. IVE estimates range from 40% to 60% each season. future studies will investigate IVE with respect to the type of influenza vaccine used. the first human cases of H7N9 infection in severely ill patients with pneumonia were detected in february 2013. as of may 22, 2014, there have been 446 confirmed H7N9 cases in china resulting in 163 deaths. multiple family clusters have been reported, but no sustained human-to-human transmission. studies show a very low detection of virus or specific antibody in close contacts. majority of patients hospitalised with H7N9 infection were older men. all H7N9 viruses are amantadine-resistant due to the S31N substitution in the M2 ion channel protein. emergence of oseltamivir resistance has been associated with poor clinical outcomes. two of these patients with severe H7N9 infection requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) also received systemic corticosteroid treatment leading to treatment failure and a poor clinical outcome. clade 1.1.2 and the internal genes from clade 2.3.2.1 emerged during 2013 and was associated with the highest number of cases (n = 26) and deaths (n = 14) in Cambodia. globally since 2003 there have been 650 confirmed H5N1 cases and 386 deaths reported in humans. china detected the first human cases of H7N9 infection in severely ill patients with pneumonia. as of may 22, 2014, there have been 446 confirmed H7N9 cases in china resulting in 163 deaths. the cases have occurred during two waves (weeks 8\u201318, 2013 and week 40, 2013 \u2013 week 20, 2014) of which 85% had prior exposure to poultry or contaminated live poultry markets. the most striking clinical features on admission were those of a severe influenza syndrome with fever, cough, fatigue and dyspnoea. high cytokine levels have been observed in patients and such excessive cytokine responses may contribute to the clinical severity of H7N9 infection. two of these patients with severe H7N9 infection requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) also received systemic corticosteroid treatment leading to treatment failure and a poor clinical outcome. the replication and transmission of H7N9 viruses containing the R292K NA mutation have been shown to be comparable to those of wild-type H7N9 viruses in guinea pigs. early initiation of oseltamivir was particularly effective in reducing mortality in H5N1 patients without respiratory failure. those requiring ventilatory support at the time of oseltamivir initiation were more likely to die. study identified age, per capita government health expenditure and delay from symptom onset to hospitalisation as key parameters. influenza-like illness (ILI) was detected in 179% of pregnant women, of whom the majority tested positive for influenza A, with substantially lower influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. influenza burden in children in rural Indian community was found to be substantial with 116% of ILI cases being caused by influenza A or B viruses. influenza-like illness (ILI) was detected in 179% of pregnant women, of whom the majority tested positive for influenza A, with substantially lower influenza B and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection. influenza burden in children in rural Indian community was found to be substantial with 116% of ILI cases being caused by influenza A or B viruses. 40% of NAIs used, while zanamivir (15%) and peramivir (5%) use was considerably less. reduced effectiveness against influenza B viruses was also observed in zanamivir33,35 and laninamivir35 trials. 38 (39%) of 97 H1N1pdm09 viruses containing the H275Y substitution were detected in 38 (39%) of 97 H1N1pdm09 viruses from community patients not receiving NAIs in Sapporo, Japan. both sets contained permissive NA mutations (V241I and N369K) that have been shown in ferret studies to offset the destabilising and negative effect of the H275Y NA mutation. oseltamivir and laninamivir each represented 40% of NAIs used. zanamivir (15%) and peramivir (5%) use was considerably less. reduced effectiveness against influenza B viruses was also observed in zanamivir and laninamivir35 trials. 275Y confers resistance to oseltamivir and peramivir, but not to zanamivir and laninamivir. a late 2013 cluster of H1N1pdm09 viruses containing the H275Y substitution was detected in 38 (39%) of 97 H1N1pdm09 viruses from community patients not receiving NAIs in Sapporo, Japan. intravenous formulation of zanamivir showed both virological and clinical effectiveness without safety concerns in patients hospitalised with influenza in japan. zanamivir is a novel pyrazinamide molecule that inhibits replication of various RNA viruses, including influenza types A, B and C. trials will target hospitalised influenza patients requiring oxygen and compare the combination of the monoclonal antibody with oseltamivir to oseltamivir monotherapy (NCT01980966) other broadly neutralising antibodies against multiple clades of H5N1 have been generated by glycan masking of key HA antigenic residues. IVE estimates range from 40% to 60% each season. in 2013/14, IVE for influenza A in children aged 1\u20135 years averaged 72% (95% CI 64\u201379), dropped to 48% (95% CI 31\u201361) in children aged 6\u201312 years. the number of confirmed cases of MERS-CoV has exceeded 830. the majority of cases have involved patients with comorbidities (76%) and are predominately males (63%) with a median age of 47.63,64 Fewer than 25% of patients have reported contact with animals including dromedary camels. more than 25% of the infections have been in healthcare workers. on +/ ribavirin, cyclosporine A, mycophenolic acid, chloroquine and lopinavir are reasonable choices for testing in controlled clinical trials. the early use of virus-specific neutralising antibodies in the form of convalescent plasma and monoclonal neutralising antibodies has the highest likelihood of clinical benefit. palivizumab prophylaxis of premature infants of 6 months of age has been shown to reduce hospitalisation due to RSV by 55%. treatment with neutralising monoclonal antibodies does not appear to reduce virus load or disease severity in hospitalised infants. a picornavirus-specific antiviral, vapendavir, was found to reduce symptom scores, lower bronchodilator puffer use and reduce viral load in asthma patients with an URTI due to HRV. the majority of cases have involved patients with comorbidities (76%) and are predominately males (63%) with a median age of 47.63,64 Fewer than 25% of patients have reported contact with animals including dromedary camels many agents have shown inhibitory effects against MERS-CoV in cell culture including interferon +/ ribavirin, cyclosporine A, mycophenolate, chloroquine and lopinavir. the early use of virus-specific neutralising antibodies for treatment of MERS-CoV has the highest likelihood of clinical benefit. palivizumab prophylaxis of premature infants of 6 months of age reduced hospitalisation due to RSV by 55%. treatment with neutralising monoclonal antibodies does not appear to reduce virus load or disease severity in hospitalised infants. a picornavirus-specific antiviral, vapendavir, was found to reduce symptom scores, lower bronchodilator puffer use and reduce viral load in asthma patients with an URTI due to HRV. Almost all children will have been infected with RSV by their 2nd birthday. nal antibodies have shown that they do not achieve superiority compared to palivizumab. treatment with neutralising monoclonal antibodies does not appear to reduce virus load or disease severity in hospitalised infants. alternative options include inhaled nanobodies, aerosolised peptides, nucleoside analogues and RNA-interference molecules. V.81 Diagnosis and treatment of respiratory infections Diagnostics Point-of-care tests that can deliver a result in 15 minutes have been available in many countries for the last decade. but while having good specificity, the sensitivity has typically been poor, ranging from 10% to 80% compared to PCR or culture. newer immunofluorescence-based tests with improved sensitivity are being developed. treatment with NTX 600 mg also led to a shorter time to alleviation of symptoms in comparison to placebo (884 versus 1057 hours, P = 002) SC increased the risks of mortality and morbidity in severe infection due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 especially with delayed antiviral therapy. a prospective study of 112 lung transplant recipients found the virus infection rates upon screening, routine and emergency visits were 14%, 15% and 34%. infections were associated with transient lung function loss and high calcineurin inhibitor blood levels. the hospitalisation rate was 50% for influenza and PIV and 169% for other viruses. treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was associated with a trend towards prolonged virus shedding. antiviral therapy initiated to treat upper respiratory tract infection (URTI) was associated with fewer cases of LRTI (OR, 004; 95% CI, 0\u201302; P 001) new or progressive bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome at day 90 was significantly reduced in 16 patients who received a small interfering RNA against the RSV N-gene. treatment with ALN-RSV01 showed a greater than eightfold reduced risk in developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome at day 180. patients with VR had longer survival than those without VR. sensitivity has typically been poor, ranging from 10% to 80% compared to PCR or culture. PCR remains the gold standard for virus diagnostics with an ability to be rapid, sensitive, specific and to identify a wide range of pathogens via different assays. treatment with NTX 600 mg twice daily for 5 days was associated with a reduction in the duration of symptoms in participants with acute uncomplicated influenza. treatment with NTX 600 mg also led to a shorter time to alleviation of symptoms in comparison to placebo (884 versus 1057 hours, P = 002) treatment with NTX 600 mg also led to a shorter time to alleviation of symptoms in comparison to placebo (884 versus 1057 hours, P = 002) SC increased the risks of mortality and morbidity in severe infection due to influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 especially with delayed antiviral therapy. a higher risk of avascular necrosis and prolonged virus shedding were observed in patients who had received high-dose SC therapy. a prospective study of 112 lung transplant recipients found the virus infection rates upon screening, routine and emergency visits were 14%, 15% and 34%. infections were associated with transient lung function loss and high calcineurin inhibitor blood levels. the hospitalisation rate was 50% for influenza and PIV and 169% for other viruses. treatment with high-dose corticosteroids was associated with a trend towards prolonged virus shedding. antiviral therapy initiated to treat upper respiratory tract infection was associated with fewer cases of LRTI (OR, 004; 95% CI, 0\u201302; P 001) and fewer hypoxaemia episodes. treatment with ALN-RSV01 showed a greater than eightfold reduced risk in developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome at day 180.110 Adenovirus (AdV) is a serious, often fatal infection in immunocompromised patients. the annual incidence of AdV infections in HSCT recipients ranges from 5% to 50%. influenza immunocompromised patients exhibit more complications, longer virus shedding and more antiviral resistance. influenza viraemia may serve as a marker for overall poor outcome with increased risk of progression to LRTI, hypoxaemia, respiratory failure and death. therapy of influenza in lung transplant recipients is associated with a reduced risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. therapy of influenza in lung transplant recipients is associated with a reduced risk of developing bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome. brincidofovir (BCV; formerly CMX-001) provides high intracellular concentrations of CDV diphosphate with a long intracellular half-life (up to 4\u201365 days) BCV is 65-fold more potent against AdV than CDV in vitro with a low risk of myeloid \u2013 or nephro-toxicity."}
