{"summary": "the current gold standard for molecular diagnostics, the quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), requires significant technical expertise and expensive and cumbersome equipment. however, isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests have been developed that rival PCR in sensitivity, cost far less, and do not necessarily rely on complex instrumentation. oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes were triggered by strand exchange reactions with transiently single-stranded stem-loop sequences. this led to the exquisitely sensitive detection of LAMP amplicons without interference [14]. toehold switch RNA sensors have also been used to link iNAATs with in vitro reporter protein translation. resulting target sequence variations can prevent recognition of assay primers and probes, leading to test failure and false negative readouts. most mismatched alleles were common among all outbreak samples and had likely appeared prior to entry of ZIKV into the Americas, but new mutations were also found. oligonucleotide strand exchange probes ensure signal specificity. gBlock double stranded DNA surrogates of ZIKV sequences were designed to include a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. gBlock double stranded DNA surrogates were designed to include a T7 RNA polymerase promoter. gBlocks were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector by Gibson assembly. plasmids were selected and maintained in an E. coli Top10 strain. all gBlock inserts were verified by Sanger sequencing at the Institute of Cellular and Molecular Biology Core DNA Sequencing Facility. 89 mM Boric acid, 2 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) containing 0.04% ammonium persulphate and 0.1% TEMED (N,N,N\u2032,N\u2032,N\u2032-Tetramethylethylenediamine) an equal volume of 2 denaturing dye (7 M urea, 1 TBE, 0.1% bromophenol blue) was added to the RNA samples. d, NS1, NS3 and NS5 genes were chosen for primer design. primer design was constrained to include at least a 40 base pair (bp) gap between the F1 and F2 as well as between the B1 and B2 priming sites. '-end of fluorophore-labeled strands were designed to be 10 or 13 nucleotides long. all 3\u2019-OH ends were blocked with inverted deoxythymidine (dT) to prevent extension by DNA polymerase. polymorphic loci in all four OSD probes were substituted with appropriate degenerate bases. ling 6 M of N5N1.2GO.Q oligonucleotide with 8 M of the quencher-labeled N5N1.2GO.Q oligonucleotide and 2 M of the fluorophore-labeled N5N1.2GO.FAM oligonucleotide. excess annealed 2GO probes were stored at 20 \u00b0C. merase and 7.5 units of RTx reverse transcriptase (NEB) were appended with 2.4 M each of a single type of FIP and BIP primer. NS5 assay used 4.8 M BIP, 1.2 M of the corresponding loop primer, 1.2 M of the corresponding stem primer, and 0.6 M each of the corresponding F3 and B3 primers. multiplex assays read using the complete bipartite signal transducer contained 100 nM each of both CAN3.2GO and N1N5.2GO probes. assays read using 4GO probes were also supplemented with 50 mM trehalose along with 80 nM of the fluorophore-labeled strand annealed. two cut-to-fit layers of inexpensive >500 nm bandpass orange lighting gel sheets placed on the observation window filter the fluorescence for observation and imaging. the following ZIKV templates were analyzed by LAMP-OSD, LAMP-2GO, and LAMP-4GO assays. standard curves were prepared using a ten-fold dilution series of 105 to 10 copies of a synthetic RNA template. these templates were subjected to one-step qRT-PCR in 10 L reactions containing 800 nM each of forward (Zika4481_F) and reverse (Zika4552c_R) primers. mosquitoes were starved for a period of 24 hours and then offered a sheep blood meal containing 106 virions. after 14 days, mosquitoes were collected and immediately frozen at 80 \u00b0C. each mosquito was heated for 10 min at 60 \u00b0C in order to inactivate the Zika virus. all oligonucleotides and gene blocks were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT), Coralville, IA, USA. gBlock double stranded DNA surrogates of ZIKV sequences were designed to include a T7 RNA polymerase promoter at their 5\u2019-ends. purified linear, double-stranded DNA transcription templates were transcribed using the HiScribe T7 High Yield RNA synthesis kit (NEB) the transcription reactions were incubated with 2 units of DNase I (NEB) at 37 \u00b0C for 30 min to degrade the template DNA before RNA gel purification. RNA pellets were washed once in 70% ethanol. dried pellets of purified RNA were resuspended in 0.1 mM EDTA. nucleic acid circuit design software NUPACK [40] was used to design four OSD probes, each specific to one of the four ZIKV amplicons. unique, fluorophore-labeled OSD strands were designed to bind between B1 and B2 sequences of NS5 and NS3 amplicons and between F1 and F2 sequences of NS1 and capsid amplicons. the CAN3.2GO probe was assembled by annealing 4 M of CAN3.2GO.Gate oligonucleotide with 6 M of the quencher-labeled CAN3.2GO.Q oligonucleotide. the mixture was then slowly cooled at the rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s to 25 \u00b0C. all oligonucleotides were mixed in 1 isothermal buffer supplemented with 8 mM MgSO4. the mixture was then slowly cooled at the rate of 0.1 \u00b0C/s to 25 \u00b0C. excess annealed 4GO probes were stored at 20 \u00b0C. multiplex assays read using OSD reporters received 200 nM of the fluorophore-labeled strand annealed with a five-fold excess of the complementary quencher-labeled strand. assays read using 2GO probes were supplemented with 50 mM trehalose and 100 nM of the fluorophore-labeled probe strand annealed with the remaining four strands of the 4GO probe. loop-mediated assays intended for visual readout and smartphone imaging were assembled in 0.2 mL optically clear thin-walled tubes with low auto-fluorescence. reactions were imaged at room temperature using an unmodified iPhone 6 and an ultraSlim-LED transilluminator. negative controls included (i) assays without any templates; (ii) assays with non-specific templates including synthetic RNA, DENV genomic RNA, and CHIKV genomic RNA. standard curves were prepared using a ten-fold dilution series of 105 to 10 copies of a synthetic RNA template (Supplementary Table S4). virions were diluted in TE 10:0.1 buffer prior to being directly added to LAMP-based and qRT-PCR reactions. mosquitoes were starved for 24 hours and then offered a sheep blood meal containing 106 virions using a hemotek membrane system. each macerated mosquito was re-suspended in 100 L water. both primer-containing and primer-free assays were used as templates. the NS3 LAMP primer set had the lowest degeneracy with only 10 positions varying between two nucleobases. the NS5 primer set was the most degenerate with 15, 6, and 1 positions varying between two, three, or four bases. the OR Boolean logic processing two-input strand exchange transducer, 2GO, is composed of two labeled strands, SI and SII, and a third bridging strand SIII. the 4GO probe is denoted in terms of lettered domains (a\u2013g) each represents a short fragment of DNA sequence in an otherwise continuous oligonucleotide strand. erate reverse transcription LAMP-OSD assays was optimized in individual amplification reactions containing different amounts of synthetic target RNA derived from ZIKV genomic sequences. all four assays could detect a few hundred copies of synthetic target RNA within 60 min without producing spurious signal. degenerate RT-LAMP-OSD assays were capable of lineage-independent ZIKV detection without cross-reaction with or interference from non-target nucleic acids. the capsid and NS3 assays recognized only Asian lineage and one of the two African lineage ZIKV genomes. NS5 assay recognized both the African lineage genomes while failing to give a signal with any Asian lineage ZIKV. all 21 LAMP primers and 4 hemi-duplex OSD reporters were combined in a single reaction. despite co-mingling of multiple degenerate primers and OSD probes, no spurious signals were observed in the absence of specific templates. RNA mixtures containing indicated copies of each of the four ZIKV synthetic RNA templates were amplified using multiplex LAMP-OSD assays. OSD fluorescence signals measured in real-time during LAMP amplification are depicted as blue (10,000 copies each of CA, NS1, NS3 and NS5). the x-axis depicts the duration of LAMP amplification. real-time OSD fluorescence signals are depicted as blue (Asian), red (African), black (CHIKV) and green (DENV) traces. the x-axis depicts the duration of amplification. the 4GO probe was composed of 5 oligonucleotides (S1\u2013S5) with a total of 19 degenerate loci that varied between two nucleobases. the strand acted as a scaffold for 4GO probe assembly. the 4GO probe would transduce the presence of one or any combination of the four ZIKV amplicons into a single-channel endpoint fluorescence that could be easily read at ambient temperature. multiplex reverse transcription LAMP reactions containing all 21 degenerate primers and the degenerate 4GO probe (multiplex LAMP-4GO) were spiked with a single type or a combination of all four of the ZIKV synthetic RNA templates. 4GO probe fluorescence, measured in real-time at 37 \u00b0C after 90 min of LAMP amplification, is depicted as red (10,000 template copies), blue (1,000 template copies), yellow (100 template copies) and black (non-specific LAMP primers with 105 copies of its target RNA) x-axis depicts duration of endpoint signal measurement. the 4GO probes were also able to specifically identify all nine Asian and both African ZIKV strains tested without cross reaction with related viruses. a previously reported Asian ZIKV NS2b gene-specific TaqMan qRT-PCR assay was able to detect only Asian lineage viral genomes while failing to amplify African lineage genomic RNA. a fluorimeter was necessary for assay readout due to the relatively high background noise of the 4GO probe. to reduce probe degeneracy, we engineered a bipartite four-input signal processor. each 2GO probe was comprised of three degenerate oligonucleotides (SI\u2013SIII) that were partially complementary to each other. fluorescence of CAN3.2GO probe increased only in assays containing CA or N3 amplicons. the N1N5.2GO probe was activated only in the presence of non-specific LAMP amplicons. both probes remained quenched in the presence of non-specific LAMP amplicons. degenerate multiplex LAMP-2GO probes and 106 copies of all four synthetic ZIKV RNA and a non-specific LAMP assay (\u201cNon\u201d) containing its cognate RNA. the reaction without any ZIKV RNA contained a non-specific RNA and its cognate LAMP primers. 2GO probe fluorescence signals measured at amplification endpoint using a cellphone. dilutions of an African ZIKV genome and non-specific DENV genomes were amplified using multiplex LAMP-2GO assays. mosquitoes tested positive by NS2b TaqMan qRT-PCR assay. only a 1/33 fraction of each mosquito was used for a LAMP test. results suggest that the LAMP-based assays were able to generate a readily discernable bright visible fluorescence starting from as few as 190 copies of ZIKV genomic material embedded in crude virus-infected matrix. NS1 LAMP-OSD assays and multiplex LAMP-2GO assays of the remaining half of the ZIKV-fed mosquitoes remained as dark as primer-less assays. the results suggest an absence of detectable infection in these mosquitoes, which is consistent with previously reported infection rates [46,47,48,49,50] degenerate LAMP-OSD Assays for Detection of ZIKV Zika virus has an 10 kilobase RNA genome encoding a polyprotein that is cleaved into ten structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. the Asian and African lineages of ZIKV show 0.2% to 10.6% intra-lineage and 4.5% to 12.1% inter-lineage nucleotide variation. twelve positions in the NS1 LAMP primer set varied between two nucleobases. the NS5 primer set was the most degenerate with 13, 6, and 1 positions varying between two, three, or four bases. the NS5 primer set was the most degenerate with 15, 6, and 1 positions varying between two, three, or four bases. the 4GO probe is denoted in terms of lettered domains (a\u2013g) each represents a short fragment of DNA sequence in an otherwise continuous oligonucleotide strand. to ensure readout specificity, individual hemiduplex OSD probes [14] were designed for each of the four ZIKV LAMP amplicons. indicated copies of capsid (A), NS3 (B), NS1 (C) and NS5 genes were amplified by degenerate LAMP-OSD assays specific to each template. OSD fluorescence signals measured in real-time during LAMP amplification are depicted as red (105 template copies), blue (104 template copies), orange (103 template copies), gray (100 template copies), and black (106 non-template RNA) traces. degenerate RT-LAMP-OSD assays were capable of lineage-independent ZIKV detection without cross-reaction with or interference from non-target nucleic acids. the capsid and NS3 assays recognized only Asian lineage and one of the two African lineage ZIKV genomes. the NS5 assay recognized both the African lineage genomes while failing to give a signal with any Asian lineage ZIKV. multiplex assays were supplemented with all 21 degenerate primers. despite co-mingling of multiple degenerate primers and OSD probes, no spurious signals were observed in the absence of specific templates. brightly fluorescent assays containing only a few hundred copies of ZIKV templates could be readily distinguished from dark ZIKV-negative reactions by simple visual examination. OSD fluorescence was imaged after 90 min of amplification using a cellphone. OSD fluorescence signals measured in real-time during LAMP amplification are depicted as blue. real-time OSD fluorescence signals are depicted as blue (Asian), red (African), black (CHIKV) and green (DENV) traces. the x-axis depicts the duration of LAMP amplification. strand exchange between 4GO probe and any one or more of the ZIKV amplicons would separate the fluorophore-bearing S2 from quencher-labeled S3. by binding S1, the NS1 amplicons would destroy the three-way junction between S1, S2 and S5. duplicate reactions were assembled using a non-specific RNA template and its cognate LAMP primers that would lead to generation of non-specific LAMP amplicons. 4GO probe fluorescence was found to be elevated in all reactions containing even a few hundred copies of at least one of the ZIKV templates. this ZIKV-specific signal remained consistently above noise generated in the absence of specific amplicons. 4GO probe fluorescence, measured in real-time at 37 \u00b0C after 90 min of LAMP amplification, is depicted as blue (Asian), red (African) and green (DENV) traces. same amount of viral genomic RNA as was used in panel F were amplified. Asian or African lineage ZIKV genomic RNA were consistently elevated above background noise in assays containing non-specific DENV genomes. a previously reported Asian ZIKV NS2b gene-specific TaqMan qRT-PCR assay [41] failed to amplify African lineage genomic RNA. multiplex LAMP-4GO assays could readily detect a few hundred copies of viral genomes. bipartite signal processor composed of two OR gated strand exchange modules (2GO) each 2GO probe was comprised of three degenerate oligonucleotides (SI\u2013SIII) that were partially complementary to each other. the 5\u2019-ends of both SI strands were labeled with the same type of fluorophore while the 3\u2019-ends of SII strands were labeled with corresponding quencher molecules. amplicon-specific 2GO probe fluorescence could be readily distinguished from non-specific noise simply by direct visual examination of assay tubes or their cellphone images. cellphone image depicts endpoint 2GO probe fluorescence of multiplex degenerate RT-LAMP assays containing primers. the complete multiplex assay system (multiplex LAMP-2GO) containing 21 degenerate LAMP primers and the bipartite signal processor (CAN3.2GO + N1N5.2GO) was tested using different amounts of a synthetic RNA mixture containing all four ZIKV templates. assays containing only a few hundred copies of ZIKV RNA produced bright fluorescence that could be readily captured using unmodified smartphone camera. fluorescent signals measured at amplification endpoint using lightCycler 96 real-time PCR machine are depicted as blue (Asian ZIKV), red (African ZIKV) and black (DENV) markers. indicated copies of an Asian lineage ZIKV genome, indicated dilutions of an African ZIKV genome, and non-specific DENV genomes were amplified. only a 1/33 fraction of each mosquito was used for a LAMP test. results suggest that the LAMP-based assays were able to generate a readily discernable bright visible fluorescence starting from as few as 190 copies of ZIKV genomic material embedded in crude virus-infected mosquito matrix. iNAATs have potential as POC diagnostics but often lack the versatility and intelligence to deal with genetically variable and rapidly evolving targets. iNAATs have potential as POC diagnostics but often lack the versatility and intelligence to deal with genetically variable and rapidly evolving targets. strand exchange nucleic acid computation has allowed analysis of repetitive DNA targets of greater than 500 nucleotides in length with single nucleotide specificity. strand exchange nucleic acid computation has allowed analysis of repetitive DNA targets of greater than 500 nucleotides in length with single nucleotide specificity. strand exchange nucleic acid computation has allowed analysis of repetitive DNA targets of greater than 500 nucleotides in length with single nucleotide specificity. the assay enhances the programmability and signal processing capability of LAMP-based tests. iNAATs lack design considerations for design considerations. iNAATs lack design considerations. strand exchange modules are compatible with preparation of lyophilized LAMP assay mixes [15]. strand exchange modules are compatible with preparation of lyophilized LAMP assay mixes [69,70,71,72,73] strand exchange modules should minimize device intricacies, and in turn reduce cost. molecular probes can be configured to capture current and future fast-evolving targets, such as zika viruses."}
