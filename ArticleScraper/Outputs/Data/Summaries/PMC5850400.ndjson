{"summary": "human coronavirus is one of six known human coronaviruses that cause respiratory disease in humans. it is the first highly pathogenic human coronavirus to emerge since the global scare caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003. the first 5\u2032 two-thirds of the genome consist of the replicase complex (ORF1a and ORF1b) the remaining 3\u2032 one-third encodes the structural proteins spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as five accessory proteins (ORF3, ORF4a, ORF4b, ORF5 and ORF8b) studies with MERS-CoV deletion-mutants of ORFs 3 to 5 are attenuated for replication in human airway-derived (Calu-3) cells [19], and deletion-mutants of ORFs 4a and 4b are attenuated for replication in hepatic carcinoma-derived (Huh-7) cells [16,20]. evasion of host innate immunity through IFN antagonism is a critical component of viral pathogenesis. MERS-CoV accessory protein ORF4a, ORF4b, and ORF5 inhibit type I IFN induction and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. dsRNA binding protein potentially acts as antagonist of the antiviral activity of IFN via the inhibition of both the interferon production (IFN- promoter activity, IRF-3/7 and NF-B activation) median time from illness onset to hospitalization is approximately four days. 65% of patients are males. median time from illness onset to death 11.5 days. the majority of patients who are hospitalized with MERS-CoV infection had chronic co-morbidities such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular diseases or end-stage renal disease. about 75% of patients testing positive for MERS-CoV have at least one co-morbid disease; fatal cases are more likely to have an underlying condition (86% among fatal cases vs. 42% among recovered or asymptomatic cases) MERS-CoV infected patients requiring mechanical ventilation also exhibited a similar co-infection profile with nosocomial bacterial infections including Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter species and Candida species. the mechanisms by which viruses promote these superinfections are diverse and replete [66]. MERS-CoV can be detected in respiratory tract secretions. tracheal secretions and broncho-alveolar lavage specimens containing a higher viral load than nasopharyngeal swabs. the virus has also been detected in feces, serum and urine. rtRT-PCR 1 Sensitivity for upE is 3.4 copies per reaction. no cross-reactivity was observed with coronaviruses OC43, NL63, 229E, SARS-CoV. RT-LAMP 1 Capable of detecting as few as 3.4 copies of MERS-CoV RNA. sensitivity similar to that of MERS-CoV real-time RT-PCR. no cross-reaction to other respiratory viruses including HCoVs. protein microarray 1 Highly sensitive assay using protein microarray technology to detect IgG and IgM antibodies 2 No cross reactivity with other respiratory pathogens observed in vitro and in silico. limit of detection found to be 1.53 nM 2 Cross reactivity with other CoVs was not evaluated 3 Primers and probes that target the conserved spike S2 region of SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and their related bat CoVs were used. a positive real-time RT-PCR assay, targeting at least two different genomic regions, is used to confirm MERS-CoV infection. a single positive assay result, confirmed by gene sequencing, can also be considered positive for MERS-CoV infection. conventional RT-PCR typically generates lower quality sequence-ready templates. studies have shown that rabbits [106], ferrets [107], hamsters [108] and wild-type mice are not suitable as models of MERS-CoV infection. in the first, a modified adenovirus expressing human DPP4 (huDPP4) is introduced intranasally to mice, which results in the expression of huDPP4 in all cells of the lung. in the second model, a transgenic mouse was produced that expresses rhesus macaques infected with MERS-CoV via intra-tracheal inoculation show clinical signs of disease, virus replication, histological lesions and neutralizing antibody production. common marmoset reproduces several, but not all features of MERS-CoV infection, and can potentially be used to evaluate novel therapies for human use. multi-spectrum antimicrobials, antivirals, interferon-2b and antifungals can be used to minimize the risk of co-infection with opportunistic pathogens. combination treatment with ribavirin and interferons inhibits MERS-CoV replication in vitro. however, this treatment in the rhesus macaques was initiated very soon after viral challenge (8 h) resveratrol downregulated apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV. resveratrol downregulated apoptosis induced by MERS-CoV. adverse effects have been reported, including increasing viral RNA replication. inhibitors of enterovirus 3Cpro showed antiviral activity by downregulating viral protein production in cells, as well as reducing release of infectious viral particles into culture supernatants. the inhibitors showed antiviral activity by downregulating viral protein production in cells, as well as reducing release of infectious viral particles into culture supernatants. inactivated viruses could be used in the production of first-generation vaccines. this is an easy first-response approach since it is relatively simple to produce whole killed virus particles. current MERS-CoV vaccines provide effective protection in few animal models. mice developed progressive pneumonia with virus replication detected in airways Preclinical: in vivo, efficacy stage [110,159] Subunit vaccines RBDs rRBDs RBDs-Fc rNTDs S/S1protein with various amino acid residues Active -hDPP4-transgenic-Ad5-hDPP4 mice Rabbit NHPs High mucosal and humoral immune response. more than 2000 cases of MERS have been reported worldwide. the disease carries a worryingly high fatality rate of >30%. the pattern of MERS-CoV lineages is more consistent with the movement of infected livestock or animal products [171] epidemiological evidence suggests that it is periodically introduced into human populations [172,173], which increases the risk for various future pandemics. this manipulation of the virus genome also provides a reverse genetics platform that could lead to the future development of MERS-CoV-based vector vaccines [181]."}
