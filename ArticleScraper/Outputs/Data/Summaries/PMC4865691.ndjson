{"summary": "rats were singly housed in static microisolation cages with ALPHA-dri paper bedding. they had unlimited access to commercial food and water purified by reverse osmosis. rats were free of rat Theiler virus, rat coronavirus, rat parvovirus, rat minute virus, Toolan H1 virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, murine adenovirus types 1 and 2, reovirus type 3, the group sizes varied due to the removal of data outliers from the study. each rat was estimated to receive 5 mg/kg carprofen daily. CG cups were weighed before placement and after removal to monitor gel consumption. anesthesia was induced in rats by using 3% to 5% isoflurane inside an induction chamber followed by maintenance by using mask delivery of 1% to 2% isoflurane and 100% oxygen. a 1-cm longitudinal skin incision was made in the left hindpaw, beginning 0.5 cm from the tibiotarsus and extending 1 cm distally. rats underwent behavioral testing of mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity 1 d prior to surgery to acquire baseline data and then daily beginning 1 d after surgery for 4 consecutive d. rats were given 15 min to acclimate in their home cage after being transported to the behavioral testing laboratory. each rat's right (contralateral) hindpaw served as its control. blood samples were collected by terminal cardiocentesis into heparinized tubes at 1, 2, 3 and 4 d after the initial administration of each analgesic (at 0900) Sentinel rats were free of rat Theiler virus, rat coronavirus, Kilham rat virus, rat parvovirus, rat minute virus, toolan H1 virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, reovirus type 3, sendai virus, pneumonia virus of mice, Mycoplasma pulmonis, and endo- and ectoparasites. rats were weighed daily after completion of behavioral testing (at 1200) each rat was estimated to receive 5 mg/kg carprofen daily. the group sizes varied due to the removal of data outliers. rats were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 4 treatments (n = 12 per treatment) each rat was placed in dorsal recumbency and the plantar surface of the left hindpaw was aseptically prepared and draped. a 1-cm longitudinal skin incision was made in the left hindpaw, beginning 0.5 cm from the tibiotarsus and extending 1 cm distally. the muscle was identified, elevated, and incised longitudinally without disrupting the muscle attachments. each stimulus was administered for 1 s on a different location on the plantar surface. the pads, toes, and heels were excluded from stimulation. mechanical hypersensitivity was defined as a significant increase in paw withdrawal frequency caused by application of focal mechanical stimuli. all samples were centrifuged, and plasma was stored at \u201380 \u00b0C. Meloxicam and carprofen concentrations were analyzed by liquid chromatography. data were analyzed by using repeated-measures ANOVA. group but not the Bup HCl rats decreased significantly (P 0.05) between day \u20131 and days 1 (0.3 0.2 and 0.0 0.0, respectively), 2 (0.2 0.2 and 0.0 0.0, respectively), 3 (0.5 0.3 and 0.8 0.4, respectively), and 4 (0.5 0.2 and 0.6 0.2, respectively) the Bup HCl group showed no withdrawal of the contralateral hindpaw on days 1 and 2. thermal hypersensitivity in the ipsilateral hindpaw of rats that received Melox-SR increased significantly (P 0.05) from day \u20131 (12.2 0.9 s) to days 1 (7.3 1.7 s), 2 (6.8 1.4 s), 3 (10.2 0.6 s), and 4 (8.4 0.9 s) oxicam in the Melox-SR group peaked at day 1 (18.5 2.5 g/mL) this value differed significantly from the concentrations on days 2 (5.9 1.0 g/mL), 3 (2.9 1.0 g/mL), and 4 (2.4 1.9 g/mL) the plasma concentration of carprofen in the CG group was similar on days 1 (16.5 1.9 g/mL), 2 (21.4 1.2 g/mL) but decreased significantly 2 oz of product, rats received 3.1 0.6 mg/kg carprofen on day \u20132, with a significant increase in dose by day 2 (4.5 0.4 mg/kg; Figure 6). CG consumption (%, and estimated carprofen dose (mg/kg), Figure 6. CG consumption (%, and estimated carprofen dose), and CG consumption (%, and mg/kg, respectively) mechanical hypersensitivity in the ipsilateral hindpaw did not differ between days \u20131 (0.6 0.2 and 0.7 0.3, respectively), 1 (2.7 1.0 and 2.9 1.0, respectively), and 2 (1.6 0.8 and 2.6 0.9, respectively) hindpaw of rats that received Melox-SR increased significantly (P 0.05) from day \u20131 (12.2 0.9 s) to days 1 (7.3 1.7 s), 2 (6.8 1.4 s), 3 (10.2 0.6 s), and 4 (8.4 0.9 s) ipsilateral hindpaw increased significantly (P 0.05) from day \u20131 (11.9 0.6 s) to days 1 (6.2 0.7 s), 2 (7.9 0.9 s), 3 the plasma concentration of carprofen in the CG group was similar on days 1 (16.5 1.9 g/mL), 2 (21.4 1.2 g/mL), and 3 (22.4 3.5 g/mL) but decreased significantly (P 0.05) on day 4 (1.3 0.1 g/mL; Figure 5). in a rat incisional pain model, Bup HCl (0.05 mg/kg SC BID for 2 d) or Bup-SR (1.2 mg/kg SC once) attenuated mechanical\u2014but not thermal\u2014hypersensitivity. in all treatment groups, rats maintained their body weight throughout the study period. 0.3 or 1.2 mg/kg Bup-SR attenuated postoperative mechanical and thermal hypersensitivity for at least 48 h. only the plasma concentrations of Bup HCl and Bup-SR on days 1 and 2 were maintained close to the reported effective plasma concentration threshold of buprenorphine in mice37 and rats. we found that Melox-SR and CG attenuated mechanical hypersensitivity for at least 48 h in this model. this is similar to previous studies in which several NSAID reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and tactile allodynia in the rat incisional pain model. s of meloxicam (20 mg/kg PO) and carprofen (10 mg/kg PO) in mice were reported to be 16.7 and 20.3 g/mL. rats consumed less CG on the first day of exposure and on the day of surgery. CG consumption steadily increased on subsequent days. meloxicam and carprofen provide alternatives to opioids for postoperative analgesia. a multimodal analgesic approach should be adopted when considering the use of NSAID to provide effective postoperative analgesia. a financial analysis of the drugs revealed minor differences in cost. we only investigated sustained-release and gel formulations in the current study. other types of long-lasting analgesics in the veterinary market should be investigated by using the same model or other pain models. different classes of analgesics should be considered depending on the type of research performed."}
