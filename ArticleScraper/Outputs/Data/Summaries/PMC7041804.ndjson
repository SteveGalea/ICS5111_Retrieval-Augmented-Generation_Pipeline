{"summary": "lectins are a diverse family of carbohydrate-binding proteins that recognize and bind to glycans with sugar-specificity. lectins are found in organismal proteomes and secretomes across all kingdoms of life, and have a variation of ligand selectivity that rivals\u2019 that of antibodies. a mannose-binding lectin from red-algae has no deleterious effects on human immune cells and rodent animal models. a mannose-binding lectin from red-algae has nanomolar inhibitory activity against HIV, hepatitis C, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and Ebola viruses. a mannose-binding lectin from red-algae has nanomolar inhibitory activity against HIV lectins (highlighted yellow) found in root systems of plants and trees elicit a diverse array of functions. these include defense against pathogens, as well as support for mutualists and symbiotes.

ML6 has only 39% overall amino acid identity to known proteins. recombinant ML6 is predicted to possess a -sheet rich globular structure (Fig 2B) with a central \u201cC\u201d cup fold (Fig 2C) typical of many lectins. ML6 exhibits a number of unique and important differences. ML6 is unusual in its ecological and taxonomic origin, monomeric composition, and diversity of mannose-binding domain sequences. lectins isolated from the plant Clematis montana showed potent antineoplastic activity towards human breast, ovarian, and liver cancer cell lines. toxicity of ML6 against a panel of human cancer cells and normal cell lines. morphologic changes were not observed for the ML6-insensitive MCF-7 cell line treated under similar conditions. ML6 avidly interacts with monosaccharide mannose haptens, suggesting binding to mannose residues on cell surface glycans is a prerequisite for ML6-mediated anticancer activity. data defining the healthy cell population from those in early and late apoptosis, or necrosis, as a function of lectin incubation time. all of the ML6-sensitive cell lines represent human epithelial cancer cells derived from mucosal tissues (e.g. lung, ovarian, cervical, bladder and colon) abnormal expression of mucins is a common phenotype of epithelial malignancies. ML6 (IC50 = 4 x 108 M) is >106 times more active than Dox (IC50 = 0.2 M) this potent and selective anticancer activity suggests that ML6 is capable of distinguishing altered expression of glycans on malignant mucosal cells. confocal microscopy studies show ML6 localized to the membrane of the lectin-sensitive A549 cell line before being internalized. this decoration of the cell surface by lectins did not result in significant cell-cell agglutination. results suggest stepwise progression of ML6 penetration into lectin-sensitive tumor cells and interaction with the nuclear envelope. normalized cellular fluorescence after 24 hours of incubation with ML6. to test the cell-specificity of ML6 binding we performed similar microscopy experiments using the insensitive cancerous and non-cancerous cell lines. this study showed that ML6 preferentially localizes to the lectin-sensitive cell line (A549) compared to in-sensitive controls (MCF-7, NL20), with a >3-fold increased avidity (Fig 4D) ML6 did not bind to glycans with identical carbohydrate backbones, but were terminated with sialic acid. glycans derived from a similar carbohydrate backbone did not show ML6-specific recognition. a diverse library of >80 novel lectins. species-rich rainforest root communities [17][21] comprise mutualists, saprophytes, pathogens [22] and even predators (fungi that use lectins to trap and eat nematodes [23]. ML6 has only 39% overall amino acid identity to known proteins. the additional 80 lectins in our library have 60% amino acid identity. this low identity suggests ML6, along with other lectins in the library, come from species fairly distant from taxa. recombinant ML6 possesses two mannose-binding domains in the monomer. ML6 is unusual in its ecological and taxonomic origin, monomeric composition, and diversity of mannose-binding domain sequences. mannose-binding lectins, particularly those of the GNA family, have been reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cells [32]. lectins isolated from the plant Clematis montana showed potent antineoplastic activity towards human breast, ovarian, and liver cancer cell lines. ML6 elicits picomolar toxicity toward five of the tested cell lines. ML6 anticancer activity and mechanism of action. curves were fit using a non-linear regression analysis to calculate IC50 values. x10-7 3.93 908 Caco-2 Colorectal Cancer 6.7 x10-7 23.93 149 MCF-7 Breast Cancer NA - Jurkat Lymphocytes NA NA - HDF Human Dermal Fibroblasts NA NA - HUVEC Human Umbilical Vein Endothelium NA NA - NL20 Normal Lung Epithelium NA NA - aSelectivity index, SI = Max. tested conc. in healthy cells/IC50, ML6 (IC50 = 4 x 108 M) is >106 times more active than Dox (IC50 = 0.2 M) and >105 more toxic than Ptx (IC50 = 0.01 M). this potent and selective anticancer activity suggests that ML6 is capable of distinguishing altered expression of glycans on malignant mucosal cells. fluorescent micrographs of lectin-sensitive cells before (UNT) and after treatment with ML6 for 1 hour and 24 hours. white and yellow arrows highlight punctate regions of ML6 localized to either the cell or nuclear membrane. ML6 localizes to the lectin-sensitive cell line (A549) compared to in-sensitive controls. ML6 elicits its cytotoxic action against certain cell lines tested in our panel. we then used a glycan microarray to characterize the lectin\u2019s saccharide specificity. this analysis revealed high-specificity of the lectin towards five short, mannose-rich N-glycans. lcNAc units on nave and incomplete glycans produced by mis-regulated glycosylation pathways in tumors. ML6 did not bind to a short glycan in which mannose disaccharides are joined through an 6-linkage. a similar backbone with 3-linked subunits was a target for the lectin. formatic analyses, oligonucleotide synthesis, and recombinant protein production can greatly increase the ease of discovery and testing of novel lectins and other useful proteins. ML6 occupies several extra- and intra-cellular domains in lectin-sensitive cell lines, including at the membrane, dissemination in the cytoplasm, and localization to the nuclear envelope. elicits its cytotoxic effects at extremely low concentrations (Table 1) and induces apoptosis in cells over a time period. ML6 specifically binds to mannose-rich polysaccharide intermediates central to the eukaryote N-glycan biosynthesis pathway.
