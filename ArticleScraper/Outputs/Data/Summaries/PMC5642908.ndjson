{"summary": "the Na/K-ATPase signaling pathway worsens obesity, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and atherosclerosis. oxidative stress imbalance is central to the pathophysiology of chronic disorders, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular diseases. Na/K-ATPase belongs to the type-II class of P-type ATPases. the A domain consists of the N-terminus and the first cytoplasmic loop connects to transmembrane helices M2 and M3. both enzymes appear to have the same two -helix motifs. the Na/K-ATPase-Src complex appears to function similar to a receptor tyrosine kinase. it appears that there is a critical binding of the tyrosine kinase domain of Src. this binding inhibits the tyrosine kinase function of Src. several studies have challenged Xie\u2019s model of direct interaction of c-Src and the 1 subunit as this interaction is critical to CTS induced signaling. in recent years, several studies have challenged Xie\u2019s model of direct interaction of c-Src and the 1 subunit. GST pulldown assays demonstrated direct interactions between the 1 subunit and Src. they further dissect which domains of Src interact with Na/K-ATPase. c-Src activation is due to an ATP-sparing effect based on cell-free sytem. ase corroborated a direct caveolin 1 and Na/K-ATPase interaction in renal membranes [13]. they were unable to show a oubain induced interaction between c-Src and 1 by immunoprecipiration assays in human breast tumor and non-tumorigenic cells [14]. the Na/K-ATPase-Src complex appears to function similar to a receptor tyrosine kinase. it appears that there is a critical binding of the tyrosine kinase domain of Src. this binding inhibits the tyrosine kinase function of Src. Xie\u2019s model of direct interaction of c-Src and the 1 subunit provides the ligand binding site and the associated c-Src functions as the kinase moiety. c-Src and the 1 subunit were co-enriched in caveolar fractions in different types of cells. GST pulldown assays demonstrated direct interactions between the 1 subunit and Src. they further dissect which domains of Src interact with Na/K-ATPase. they found that the Src SH2 domain binds to 1 CD2 domain and the Src kinase domain associate with the 1 N domain. contradictory results to Xie were by Clifford et al. who were unable to show a oubain induced interaction between c-Src and 1 by immunoprecipiration assays in human breast tumor and non-tumorigenic cells [14]. there are noticeable differences in experimental design(different cell lines and animal models used at the very least. increase in ROS can oxidize the Na/K-ATPase / subunits and its independent regulator FXYD proteins. oxidation inhibits its activity and promotes its susceptibility to degradation by proteasomal and endosomal proteolytic pathways. S-nitrosylation of Cys46 in the -subunit of Na/K-ATPase was reported to cause a 20% decrease in Na/K-ATPase activity upon exposing cardiomyocytes to hypoxia. in vivo studies have demonstrated that both, CTS and glucose oxidase-induced H2O2, stimulates direct 1 subunit carbonylation of Pro222 of the actuator(A domain) ser36 and ser68 detaches PLM inhibition from Na/K-ATPase. the enzyme also contain cysteine residues that may undergo reversible S-glutathionylation. 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) is another oxidative stress byproduct. pNaKtide is not specific for ouabain or other CTS stimulated pathways. other c-Src kinase inhibitors include quinolinones, which have potencies for in vitro c-Src inhibition at 500 nM. other c-Src kinase inhibitors include iminochromenes with a potency of 2 M. pNaKtide is effective in disrupting the formation of the Na/K-ATPase/Src receptor complex in a dose-dependent manner. pNaKtide blocks ouabain-induced activation of Src, ERK, and hypertrophic growth in cardiac myocytes. PP2 produces more inhibition on basal Src activity than that of pNaKtide in both LLC-PK1 and cardiac myocytes. studies have shown that fat accumulation (obesity) is correlated with systemic oxidative stress in both humans and mice. well-known oxidative injury markers have been positively correlated with obesity in human clinical studies. ase/Src signaling pathway engage in a positive feedback loop to produce more ROS, in a setting of limited antioxidant capacity. adipocyte mitochondrial dysfunction is also proposed as one of the reasons there is increased ROS production in obesity. adipocytes have low levels of total antioxidants characterized by lower levels of serum vitamins A, E, C and -carotene, as well as glutathione. the subpar ROS scavenging system might exacerbate the high levels of ROS produced by hypertrophied adipocytes. we propose that visceral adipocytes create systemic oxidant stress through the feed-forward oxidant amplification loop of Na/K-ATPase-Src-EGFR signaling. CVD is the leading cause of mortality in western countries, with approximately 30% of deaths in the united states attributed to it. oxidative stress affects transcription factors (such as NF-xB), which is inactivated by antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents. oxidative stress affects transcription factors (such as NF-xB), suggesting that atherosclerosis is an inflammatory process, which is strongly affected by oxidative stress. xanthine oxidase, and NAPDH oxidase (Nox4 gene upregulation) activity is increased, are sources of ROS. patients with compromised heart function have total Na/K-ATPase concentrations decreased by 40%, and at the subunit level, the 1-, 3-, and 1-proteins levels are reduced in human heart failure. oxidative stress is associated with glomerular damage, proteinuria, sodium and volume retention, and nephron loss, all of which are important in the development of hypertension [73,74]. coordination of two major ion transporters, the basolateral Na/K-ATPase and the apical NHE3, has been implicated in high salt intake (volume expansion) mediated blood pressure increase."}
