{"summary": "receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) regulates normal lung physiology, cell motility, and inflammatory reactions. ligands (HMGB1, S100A8/S100A9, and amyloid -peptide) bind to proteoglycans on the cell surface. these interactions regulate the ligand binding and signaling of the receptor. intravenous glycyrrhizin downregulates serum aspartate aminotransferase and alanine transaminase levels and reduces the occurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. glycyrrhizin has anti-viral effects in vitro and it dampens inflammatory reactions in various animal models. HMGB1 binding to heparan sulphate proteoglycan (HSPG) type cell surface receptors is a prerequisite to it promoting activity of tissue emigration of cells in vivo. it has been unclear whether interactions of HMGB1 with HSPGs can be inhibited by glycyrrhizin. peptide 1\u201342 was from American Peptide (Sunnyvale, CA, USA) K5 carbohydrates, chondroitin sulphate, and dermatan sulphate were from Iduron (Manchester, United Kingdom) salt concentrations in glycyrrhizin and glucose stock solutions were equalized. transfection of phGLuc\u2013RAGE plasmids (100 ng of DNA per well) was performed after 24 h. detection of PCA signal was measured 48 h post-transfection. at least four replicate wells per condition were analyzed. sRAGE\u2013Ig protein (0.1 g/mL) was incubated in wells in presence of various amounts of glycyrrhizin. sRAGE\u2013Ig protein (0.1 g/mL) was incubated in wells in presence of various amounts of glycyrrhizin. affinity chromatography of HMGB1 was carried out as previously described using PBS as a chromatography buffer. HMGB1 or thrombin were loaded onto the column in the presence of different concentrations of glycyrrhizin, the column was washed with PBS, and bound protein was eluted with PBS containing 1.5 M NaCl. HMGB1 was diluted with PBS (25 g/mL) and divided to 100 L aliquots. one-hundred microliters of 50% heparin\u2013Sepharose slurry in PBS was added to aliquots. AGE-BSA was produced as described [35]. chondroitin sulphate and dermatan sulphate were made in 1% ethanol, pH 7.5. monomeric fluorescent protein A coated beads were incubated with 10 g/mL of different sRAGE\u2013Ig forms. plasmids containing complementary fragments of humanized Gaussia (hGLuc) luciferase and livecell protein-fragment complementation assay were cloned. transfection of phGLuc\u2013RAGE plasmids (100 ng of DNA per well) was performed after 24 h. yloid 1\u201342 peptide (20 nM, American Peptide, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) or biotinylated HMGB1 (20 nM) were bound to the wells in the presence or absence of inhibitors. the color was developed using o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride peroxidase substrate (Sigma-Aldrich) HMGB1 was loaded to the column in the presence of different concentrations of glycyrrhizin, the column was washed with PBS, and bound protein was eluted with 1.5 M NaCl. HMGB1 in elution fractions was detected with an anti-HMGB1 immunoblot [32], and thrombin was detected in a dot blot assay using Coomassie blue staining. heparin\u2013Sepharose was pelleted and washed with PBS. samples were incubated in rotation at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. heparin\u2013Sepharose was pelleted and washed with PBS. wei et al. have described non-covalent homophilic interactions occur between V1-domains and dimerization by covalent homophilic bonding via interchain disulphide bridge between C2-domains. we studied whether the homophilic interactions of recombinant sRAGE occur in low protein concentrations using bead aggregation assay. the images are taken after 60 min of bead aggregation. Nt and N0 are the total number of particles at incubation times t and 0, respectively. extent of bead aggregation is represented by the index Nt/N0. Xu et al. have shown that sRAGE dimerization is enhanced by heparin. dimerization at the cell surface is inhibited by heparanase treatment. soluble heparin may interfere with cell surface RAGE\u2013heparan sulphate interactions. sulphated oligosaccharides inhibit RAGE binding to amyloid -peptide and HMGB1 Heparin. oligosaccharides derived from chondroitin and dermatan sulphates did not inhibit RAGE\u2013ligand binding. glycyrrhizin has a high content of sulphated L-iduronic acid units. Sulphated K5 polysaccharides inhibit receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE)\u2013ligand binding. binding of soluble biotinylated ligands to full length extracellular human RAGE (sRAGE) coated plastic microwells was analysed. glycyrrhizin inhibited full-length luciferase activity in cells. glycyrrhizin inhibited full-length luciferase activity in cells. this is preventing further studies with glycyrrhizin in the PCA assay. glycyrrhizin inhibits AGE binding to advanced glycation end product bovine serum albumin (AGE-BSA) the binding was inhibited by glycyrrhizin and heparin. heparin-binding sites of HMGB1 are located at the linker sequence between A- and B-boxes and at the amino terminal part of the A-box. this suggests that HMGB1 binding to HSPGs might be necessary to RAGE\u2013HMGB1 complex signaling. this suggests that glycyrrhizin can inhibit heparin binding in heparin\u2013Sepharose chromatography. glycyrrhizin inhibits binding of both the full-length HMGB1 and the full length HMGB1. binding to heparin is inhibited by millimolar concentrations of glycyrrhizin. it is tempting to speculate that glycyrrhizin might inhibit RAGE signaling via interfering HMGB1\u2013heparan sulphate interactions. glycyrrhizin inhibits binding of full-length HMGB1 and HMGB1 A-box to heparin\u2013Sepharose. precipitated HMGB1 was detected with Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE. recombinant sRAGE\u2013Ig protein and Ig-fragments bearing RAGE domains used in this study are dimeric proteins. sRAGE\u2013Ig and V1\u2013Ig induced bead aggregation in protein-A coated bead suspension. the lack of C2-domain in recombinant protein resulted in a diminished oligomerisation. sRAGE\u2013Ig fusion protein lacking V1-domain, open circle curve represents sRAGE\u2013Ig fusion protein lacking C2-domain. cross curve represents sRAGE\u2013Ig fusion protein lacking C2-domain, and close square curve represents Fc control protein coated beads. this is the first time that it has been shown that RAGE self-association in the living cells can be inhibited by heparin. cells were transfected with full length RAGE\u2013cytoplasmic hGLuc fragment chimeras. hDLuc fragment chimeras of APP served as a positive control of homodimerization. hGLuc self-association was partially inhibited by heparin. the minimum size of oligosaccharides required for strong inhibition was 3100\u20135800 Da. sulphated disaccharides derived from chondroitin and dermatan sulphates did not inhibit RAGE\u2013ligand binding. glycyrrhizin and Heparin Inhibit AGE\u2013RAGE -Interactions Glycyrrhizin has two non-sulphated D-glucuronic acids in its structure. the inhibition is mainly due to binding of glycyrrhizin to HMGB1. glycyrrhizin interferes HMGB1 binding to CXCR4, toll-like receptor 2 and toll-like glycyrrhizin inhibited RAGE binding to AGE-BSA coated microwells. the effect of glycyrrhizin on RAGE\u2013AGE interactions was also tested in cell adhesion assay. PC3 cells adhered to RAGE V1-domain, but not to C1- or C2-domains. glycyrrhizin and heparin inhibit cell surface AGE-mediated adhesion of PC3 prostate cancer cells to RAGE V1-domain. microwells were coated with RAGE V1\u2013Fc, type I collagen, laminin, or fibronectin (10 g/mL) heparin\u2013Sepharose column bound HMGB1 was eluted with the same NaCl concentration (0.7 M) as full-length HMGB1. this suggests that the A-box lacking heparin binding cationic amino acid residues in a linker sequence is still able to bind to heparin. glycyrrhizin inhibited binding of both the full-length HMGB1 and the full length HMGB1 HMGB1 in phosphate buffered saline was loaded to a heparin\u2013Sepharose column in the presence of 0\u20133 mM glycyrrhizin. bound protein was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 280 nm. HMGB1 A-box binds to heparin and binding is inhibited by glycyrrhizin. ated A-box was detected with anti-HMGB1 Western blotting. Optical densities of protein bands were measured. error bars represent SD; * = p 0.05 when compared with glucose control."}
