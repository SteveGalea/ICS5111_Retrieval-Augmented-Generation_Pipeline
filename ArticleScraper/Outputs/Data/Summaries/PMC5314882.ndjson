PECAM-1 inhibits tyrosine-based inhibitory motifs (ITIMs) on function of the platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule-1 (PECAM-1).96 PECAM-1 is a dual ITIM-containing receptor of the Ig superfamily that is capable of inhibiting immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-induced activation of B cells, T cells, and mast cells. RS domains of SR proteins can range from 50 to over 300 residues in length. SRPK1 phosphorylates the prototype SR protein, serine/arginine-rich splicing factor 1 (SRSF1). this protein contains 6 AiBSs, residues 34\u201343, 75\u201387, 123\u2013129, 144\u2013177, 186\u2013197, and 221\u2013245. the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITM) 1, 2, and 3 that inhibit the replication of multiple pathogenic viruses are among the products of such interferon-stimulated genes. the entry of the viruses relies on the specialized fusion proteins. the longest NTD of IFITM10 contains 3 AiBSs, residues 8\u201329, 51\u201364, and 71\u201382. the longest NTD of IFITM10 contains 3 AiBSs, residues 8\u201329, 51\u201364, and 71\u201382. mouse ryanodine receptors (RyRs) are the largest tetrameric Ca2+ release channels (2.2 MDa) of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in the electrically excitable cells. the -trefoil fold of this domain is rescued by the transformation of the part of the preceding region of unknown structure into the missing -strand. this -helix undergoes structural transformation to a -strand, thereby rescuing the -strand deleted in the RyR2A3 due to the removal of 3 in the RyR2 gene. this newly discovered 2-helix corresponds to the region of missing electron density in the earlier crystal structures of the protein, is rather dynamic. 119 to a highly extended open form in a complex with other subunits of the bacterial F1 complex. ability of the subunit to undergo large conformational change associated with binding to the F1 complex is determined by the presence of long IDPR at the C-terminal region. activity of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) is regulated via binding of ancillary subunits, the cyclins,121 which also participate in targeting the kinase to specific substrates. a yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) CDK Pho85 can bind up to 10 different Pho85 cyclins. sirtuin-2 is a member of a large family of protein-modifying enzymes, NAD+-dependent deacetylases, which are highly conserved throughout bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes. in humans, there are 7 sirtuin homologues with distinct cellular locations. isoforms contain a leucine-rich nuclear export signal (NES) within their N-terminal region which mediate their cytosolic localization139 where they have numerous functions. a recent finding a new isoform-5 with the predominant nuclear localization helped resolve an apparent contradiction between the predominant cytosolic localization of this protein and the existence of multiple nuclear functions. the ANCHOR analysis15,16 of the human sirtuin-2 revealed that this alternative splicing event removed 2 AiBSs (located at the residues 1\u201315 and 36\u201349 of the isoform-1). therefore, functionality of siruin-2 is modulated by alternative splicing that remove potential binding sites from the disordered region of this protein. bioinformatics analysis revealed that the analyzed sequence (WDQKKPRNRR) is a part of long intrinsically disordered tail that spans over the last 100 residues of human semaphorin-3. this is an important contribution since it adds a crucial structural information on osteocalcin. modified and non-modified osteocalcin from different sources are mostly disordered. the explanation for this apparent contradiction can be derived from the analysis of conditions used for the 3 Glu-OCN crystallization. this approach allowed better realization of the high anionic charge in the helical regions of osteocalcin. cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) is the cAMP-regulated transcription factor that has been shown to stimulate target gene expression often via the associating with the coactivator paralogs P300 and CREB binding protein (CBP). 160-162 Complex formation between CREB and CBP/P300 requires protein kinase A (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of CREB at Ser-133.160 NF-Y is known to interact with a CCAAT box NF-B is a common transcription factor present in almost all cell types. NF-B is a homo- or heterodimeric complex formed by the Rel-like domain-containing proteins RELA/p65, RELB, NF-B1/p105, NF-B1/p50, REL and NF-B2/p52. the high levels of functional intrinsic disorder is a \u201cfamily signature\u201d of the transcription factors in general. intrainsic disorder propensities are evaluated by PONDR\u00ae FIT (green lines), PONDR\u00ae VLXT (gray lines), PONDR\u00ae VSL2B (blue lines), and PONDR\u00ae VL3 (red lines) phosphorylation sites in melanopsin are critical for mediating deactivation of the photopigment melanopsin. -defensins are small (29\u2013129 amino acids) cationic, amphipathic polypeptides with a predominantly -sheet structure stabilized by 3 disulfide bonds. search of UniProt for human defensins produces about 40 hits, of which 6 entries were -defensin. fensins are produced in a form of proprotein containing a signal peptide and/or a propeptide. it is likely that the presence of noticeable disordered tails plays a role in the maturation of defensins. Burke et al. investigated the roles of the phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein (RbC) in interaction of Rb with the E2F transcription factor. phosphorylation of S788, S795, S807 and S811 weakens the direct association between the RbC and the marked-box domains of E2F. the longest disordered region is the C-terminal tail (residues 7\u201320, 41\u201349, 57\u201364, 830\u2013840, 844\u2013860, 872\u2013881, and 891\u2013919. the fact that phosphorylation sites of the RbC are located within the disordered region is in agreement with the general trend. s of the Frmpd1 fragment were clearly resolved adopting an extended conformation that occupied most of the concave channel formed by the 8 TPR motifs. the noticeable exceptions were the 11 residues in the loop connecting the A and B of TPR3 (amino acids 153\u2013163) and the 6 residues at the C terminus (amino acids 345\u2013350) in the LGN-TPR. human LGN protein is involved in a wide range of protein-protein interactions, clearly serving as an important hub protein. a short fragment of Frmpd1 (amino acids 901\u2013938) was shown to bind to the 8 TPR motifs of AGS3.200. a 50-residue fragment of Frmpd1 was shown to bind to LGN with a Kd1 M.188,194 Curiously, besides mentioned regions of missing electron density in the the term ANCHOR-indicated binding site (AiBS) is used to identify a region of a protein suggested by the ANCHOR algorithm to have significant potential to be a binding site for an appropriate but typically unidentified partner protein. this analysis revealed that there are 10 AiBSs in LGN (residues 370\u2013379, 436\u2013452, 491\u2013499, 508\u2013513, 531\u2013537, 545\u2013553, 5 uin-1catalytic domain (residues 234\u2013510) in complex with its C-terminal regulatory segment (CTR, residues 641\u2013665).203 In this structure, the catalytic domain adopts the canonical sirtuin fold, whereas CTR forms a -hairpin structure complementing the -sheet of the catalytic domain. human sirt1 is implicated in a wide range of human diseases due to the fact that this enzyme plays multiple roles in cellular processes ranging from energy metabolism to cell survival via it ability to deacetylate a wide range of substrates. 209 both termini of human sirt1 are predicted to be mostly disordered, whereas the central catalytic domain is mostly ordered. the endosome-associated deubiquitinase AMSH Davies et al. performed a systematic mutational analysis to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of activation of AMSH. the mutations AMSH were implemented in microcephaly capillary malformation (MIC-CAP) syndrome in children211 further reiterate the importance of this study. AMSH contains a long IDPR (residues 90\u2013250) that is located in the close proximity to the known STAM-binding motif of this protein. ANCHOR analysis shows that AMSH contains a disorder-based binding site at position 205\u2013213. the dimer formed by the truncated periplasmic domain of TonB protein (residues 150\u2013239) is a highly intertwined and elongated structure with noticeable domain swapping. residues 39\u2013157 and 236\u2013239 are not seen in the resulting structure. the disordered N-terminal and C-terminal tails clearly have functional importance. the structure of the human DNAJA1 J-domain consists of 4 -helices, residues 17\u201321 (1), 29\u201342 (2), 52\u201365 (3), and 68\u201375 (4). the structure of the human DNAJA1 J-domain consists of 4 -helices, residues 17\u201321 (1), 29\u201342 (2), 52\u201365 (3), and 52\u201365 (3). Pur and Pur are members of a small family of nucleic acid-binding proteins that interact with purine-rich ssDNA or RNA sequences homologous to the so-called PUR element described in eukaryotic gene flanking regions. tetherin is a type II transmembrane protein that contains both an N-terminal transmembrane region and a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. it is believed that tetherin-caused viral retention relies on this unusual architecture, where one transmembrane anchor may remain in the cellular plasma membrane. the scaffolding protein p21 is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1, UniProt ID: P38936) is predicted to be mostly disordered. there are 5 AiBSs in this relatively small protein, residues 36\u201341, 68\u201379, 100\u2013105, 109\u2013123 and 145\u2013164. human and mouse apolipoproteins A-I analyzed mechanistic peculiarities of the interaction between the high density lipoprotein (HDL) particles and human or mouse apolipoprotein A-I (ApoA-I) the authors established that the C-terminal domains (CTDs) of human and mouse ApoA-I proteins are the major players facilitating interactions of these proteins with HDL. mouse ApoA-I proteins are predicted to be mostly disordered. there are 3 AiBSs in both proteins (residues 15\u201321, 158\u2013164, and 221\u2013230 in human protein, and residues 13\u201318, 173\u2013204. human MAVS (UniProt ID: Q7Z434) is involved in a wide array of protein-protein interactions. it contains multiple alternatively spliced isoforms, sites of posttranslational modifications. ANCHOR analysis15,16 revealed that it contains 8 AiBSs located at the residues 123\u2013148, 156\u2013268, 277\u2013290, 194\u2013325, 338\u2013377, 397\u2013410, 416\u2013449, and 463\u2013479. protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) serves as a RhoA/ROCK effector. it regulates dynamic reorganization of the cytoskeleton crucial for cell motility. phosphatase-1 (PP1) is expected to be intrinsically disordered. longest disordered region covering 72% of protein length. some bacteria are able to form endospores in response to adverse growth conditions. 242,243 Spores formed as a result of such sporulation process are extremely resistant to various environmental insults. this awakening is controlled by the specific nutrient sensors, cognate germinant receptors (GRs) located in the inner membrane of the spore. structure of the individual chains can be superimposed on each other except to the loosely packed H8 helices. helices H1\u2013H7 in each GerD60-180 chain twist around the central axis to form 2 complete turns of a right-handed supercoil. asome Forer et al. investigated the interaction between the prokaryotic ubiquitin-like protein (Pup), the proteasome regulatory subunit Mpa (mycobacterium proteasome ATPase) and proteasome accessory factor A (PafA), an enzyme that forms an isopeptide bond between the -carboxylate of a glutamate at the C-terminus of Pup and the -amine of a substrate lysine the nucleolar PICT-1/GLTSCR2 protein Borodianskiy-Shteinberg et al. studied self-association of the human protein interacting with carboxyl terminus-1 (PICT-1) it was suggested that PICT-1 might act as a potential tumor suppressor, being involved in interaction with the C-terminal region of the tumor suppressor phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) recognition of modified tRNA by the HIV-1 nucleocapsid protein p7.251. p7 recruits htRNALys3UUU from the host cell by binding to and remodeling the tRNA structure. p7 is a 55-residues-long protein. p7 binds single-stranded nucleic acids nonspecifically. it coats the genomic RNA protecting it from nucleases. p7 also serves as an RNA chaperone that enhances several nucleic acid-dependent steps of viral life. readers will find this new series useful, since it might increase the awareness of the scientific community about importance of intrinsic disorder for protein function. we hope to see submissions from readers who found some important intrinsic disorder overlook in published articles."}
