{"summary": "of the 213 viruses, 31 (15%) were identified in nonhuman vertebrates and 27 (13%) in arthropod vectors before being incriminated as human pathogens. the gap between the two cumulative trends represents the lag in years (1\u201377 y) between discovery and incrimination. by 1950 half (51%) the viruses now known to be pathogenic were arboviruses. nonarbovirus discovery remained consistent at approximately two new viruses yearly from the mid-1950s through 2010. only 2% (2 of 83) of pathogenic arboviruses were discovered during the last 30 y of the study period (1981\u20132010) all of the arboviruses are known or presumed zoonoses. even the few transmitted between humans by vectors, such as those causing dengue, have sylvatic transmission cycles (15) there are a number of instances of single nucleotide polymorphisms contributing to arbovirus epidemics. lead scientists working for 82 institutions were responsible for the discovery of the 130 nonarboviruses, compared with 25 institutions for the 83 arboviruses. the RF established field stations in Brazil, Nigeria, Colombia, and Uganda as part of a strategy to eliminate yellow fever virus transmission. in 1937-1950, RF scientists working at the yellow fever stations in Uganda, Colombia, and Brazil documented six previously unknown arboviruses. more than 120 confirmed or probable arboviruses have been isolated from arthropods or vertebrates. the sharp decline in discovery of human arboviruses was presaged by the predetermined end of the 15-y RF program in the mid-1960s. the RF pioneered modern arbovirus research, provided short-term study grants, developed and disseminated new methods. no human arboviruses were isolated at any of the former RF supported field stations after 1970. no human arboviruses were isolated at any of the former RF supported field stations after 1970. the arboviruses were predominately discovered in North America and Europe. the discovery of nonarboviruses in the tropics has lagged as well. the development of faster, more sensitive methods for virus identification will continue to be important in discovering new pathogens. but strategy, support, and commitment for looking in the right places in the right ways will be critical to their most effective use. serological surveys indicating past exposure to a virus without evidence for pathogenicity were discounted. 185 of the 213 listed viruses, 185 were listed as species in the ninth international committee on taxonomy of Viruses report."}
