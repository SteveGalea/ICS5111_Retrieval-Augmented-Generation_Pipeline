{"summary": "multiplex PCR is a highly sensitive, highly specific test for the detection of viral nucleic acids in respiratory secretions. if PCR reveals the presence of RNA derived from respiratory syncytial virus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus, or influenza virus then an acute infection caused by the corresponding pathogen is likely present. RSV causes apnea in neonates and young infants, even if patients had received prophylactic treatment with palivizumab (e4) bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis with respiratory failure and obstruction of the small airways. neuraminidase inhibitors are at best of moderate effectiveness (27) patients with immunosuppression and acute pulmonary deterioration may also benefit from stringent flu diagnostics. neuraminidase inhibitors could also be defined more generously. 5\u20136% of all cases of pneumococcal pneumonia are associated with flu. HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 were discovered as early as the 1960s. as a rule they cause benign disorders of the upper respiratory tract (28) bronchiolitis is a clinical diagnosis with respiratory failure and obstruction of the small airways. many study authors recommend refraining from routine diagnostic evaluation in children with bronchiolitis. these impose physical stress and lead to unnecessary inpatient admissions and treatment. only 58% of inpatients and 7% of outpatients with influenza were tested for this pathogen (24) in the us in every flu season, there are 0.5\u20133.8 deaths per 1 000 000 children and adolescents (25) half of the children who die from flu do not have any of the well-known risk factors. MERS is caused by HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1. coronaviruses can also cause febrile convulsions (28) nucleic acids from rhinoviruses (32) and coronaviruses (33) can persist for weeks and months. this is observed particularly in hypogammaglobulinemia (34) the molecular confirmation of these four pathogens should always raise suspicions of infections in the more distant past. the cost then incurred for PCR diagnostics, of 330.78 Euro/specimen, has been reduced since then (37). atypical bacterial pathogens. the prevalence of mycoplasma in this study in 2010 was up to 58%. fewer than 2% of infections with Legionella spp. manifest in childhood or adolescence. the Robert Koch-Institute attests extraordinarily high sensitivity to PCR techniques for the confirmation of legionella bacteria from respiratory secretions and tissues. patient population Pathogen Particular relevance Notes First months of life Influenza Trigger of apnea, oseltamivir treatment if required (27) *1, *2 RSV (human respiratory syncytial virus) Trigger of apnea, preventing further, superfluous diagnostics and therapy. hMPV, influenzavirus, parainfluenza virus enables conclusions about the causative pathogen. a clinical evaluation, hopefully aided by quantitative PCR techniques, is needed in order to distinguish acute infections from subclinical events with nucleic acid persistence."}
