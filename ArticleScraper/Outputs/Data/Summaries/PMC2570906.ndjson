{"summary": "field work was conducted at 8 sites in a 7,834-km2 area northwest of one of the most important winter roosts of bats in central Europe. the town is located in Schleswig-Holstein, the northernmost federal state of Germany. the limestone cave shelters >20,000 bats of up to 8 vespertilionid bat species during hibernation. RT-PCR was performed exactly as described previously. a core region of 334 bp as covered by most GenBank entries was used for analysis. sequences from northern german bat coronaviruses can be retrieved from GenBank under accession nos. EU375853\u2013EU375875. no virus growth could be confirmed by RT-PCR. all pond bats (M. dasycneme) were marked with aluminum bands for tracking during an ongoing survey and protection program established by the Schleswig-Holstein Federal Ministry of Environment. a radio transmitter (Holohill, Ontario, Canada) was used for bat tracing. all analyses on the 334-bp fragment were repeated with the complete 440-bp fragment for validation. results are therefore not shown. all statistical procedures were done with the Statgraphics V 5.1 software package (Manugistics, Dresden, Germany) pygmaeus 57 (3) 36 15/0/21 6 10 1, 2, 4, 5 *Name/ type of habitat /geographic coordinates: location 1, Westensee/ f /9\u00b058\u203217\u2032\u2032E/54\u00b016\u203244\u2032\u2032N; 2, Achterwehr/ f /9\u00b057\u203244\u2032\u2032E/54\u00b018\u203255\u2032\u2032N; 3, Methorst/m /9\u00b049\u203257\u2032\u2032E/54\u00b016\u203250\u2032\u2032N; detection rates were not equally distributed but correlated significantly with the location in which bats were caught. similar observations were made for 3 other virus-positive species. s between foraging and swarming sites were not significant (p = 0.609) northern german viruses clustered in 1 large monophyletic clade containing no other previously known virus. in a sister relationship was a clade of viruses from Chinese bats with prototype strains. lineage 1 was associated with M. dasycneme, lineage 2 with P. nathusii, lineage 3 with P. pygmaeus, and lineage 4 with M. daubentonii. within the same lineage was 1 coronavirus from an M. dasycneme bat that had been sampled at a different site and at a different time. the lowest degrees of nucleic acid distances were observed between mouse hepatitis virus, human CoV HKU1 and the hCoV-OC43/bovine CoV pair, at 16%\u201318%. the 2 established lineages within CoV group 2b (SARS-like CoV, bat-SARS CoV HKU3) were 10% distant. male bats avoid maternity colonies because they have at least partial immune protection because of infection earlier in life. study could propose a scenario in which the young provide a susceptible population, amplifying the virus and transmitting it to adult females in maternity colonies. the palearctic Myotis virus would form a distinct coronavirus species with German and Chinese subspecies. a continuous virus population might thus coexist with a continuous palearctic Myotis population. a continuous virus population might coexist with a continuous palearctic Myotis population. this could be a correlate of independent adaptations to P. nathusii and P. pygmaeus. targeted eradication of bats is technically impossible and ecologically detrimental."}
