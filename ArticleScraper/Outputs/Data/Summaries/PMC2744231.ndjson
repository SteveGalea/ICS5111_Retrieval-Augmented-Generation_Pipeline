{"summary": "wild bird species from which oropharyngeal swabs and fecal samples were collected and screened for coronavirus RNA, England. samples were collected from 441 individual wild birds of 42 species, including both migratory and resident species. fecal samples and oropharyngeal swabs were collected from live birds that had been caught primarily for ringing purposes (8). ler Anas clypeata 1 Eurasian wigeon Anas penelope 33 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common teal Anas crecca 18 Common uelis spinus 5 Viral RNA was extracted from pooled fecal samples and pooled oropharyngeal swabs by using a QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Crawley, UK) the primers UTR41+ (5\u2032-ATGTCTATCGCCAGGGAAATGTC-3\u2032) and UTR11- (5\u2032-GCTCTAACTCTATACTAGCCTA-3\u2032 targeted the 3\u2032 un phylogenetic trees were drawn to scale; branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances were used to infer the phylogenetic tree. animal-level prevalences and confidence limits were estimated by using a pooled prevalence calculator (www.ausvet.com.au/pprev) Whooper swan Standing fresh water Adult M Whooper swan Standing fresh water Adult M Whooper swan Standing fresh water Adult M Whooper swan Standing fresh water Adult F 2 Teal Estuarine salt marsh Juvenile F Anas/UK/p20/2005 Mallard Estuarine salt marsh Unknown M Mallard Estuarine salt marsh Unknown M Wigeon Estuarine salt marsh Unknown F Mallard Estuarine salt marsh salt marsh Unknown F Wigeon Estuarine salt marsh Unknown F Wigeon Estuarine salt marsh Unknown M *Cov, coronavirus; RT-PCR, reverse transcription\u2013PCR. phylogenetic analyses were based on a final usable sequence of 146 nt after removal of primer sites. coronavirus sequences detected in red knots clustered with a previously described goose coronavirus. divergence at the nucleotide level was 2.0%. coronavirus RNA was detected only in wildfowl and waders. the detection of coronaviruses that appear to be related to IBV in wild migratory birds raises questions as to their role in the transmission, dissemination, and evolution of IBV strains."}
