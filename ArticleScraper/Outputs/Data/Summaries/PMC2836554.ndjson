{"summary": "eukaryotic 1 PRF requires two in cis RNA elements within the mRNA. the optimal distance between stimulator and slippery site will then position the A- and P-site tRNAs on the slippery site (13\u201315). RNA pseudoknot is a hairpin-type RNA pseudoknot in which nucleotides from a hairpin loop form base pairs with a single-stranded region outside the hairpin. it leads to a quasi-continuous RNA double-helical structure with a topology featuring two helical stems of the base-pairing region (stems 1 and 2) connected by two single-stranded loops (loops 1 and 2). no high-resolution structural information is available for this class of pseudoknots. the other group of pseudoknots includes mouse mammary tumor virus pseudoknot (MMTV-PK), beet western yellow virus (BWYV-PK) and simian retrovirus pseudoknot (SRV-PK), has a short stem 1 of 7 bp in length (16) a DU177 mutant lacking most of the triple interactions identified in DU177 has essentially no frameshift activity but still adopts a pseudoknot conformation. a non-coding RNA may act in-trans to stimulate 1 PRF on targeted mRNAs by specific intermolecular triplex formation. all mutants were constructed using the quick-change mutagenesis kit from Stratgene. RNA synthesis and enzymatic structure probing RNA transcripts were generated by in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase. the purified RNAs of desired length were then dephosphorylated by calf intestine alkaline phosphatase. all reactions were incubated at 20\u00b0C for 10 min unless specified. the reactions were terminated by addition of gel loading dye. gel was run at a constant voltage of 150 V for 8 h at room temperature. Oligonucleotides containing slippery sequence (TTTAAAC), spacer (GGGTT) and stimulator sequences were synthesized. they were amplified by forward and reverse primers containing BsrGI and BsaAI sites. a 1-frame stop codon was inserted into the p2luc reporter. hydrolysis RNA ladders were obtained by incubation of RNA in the hydrolysis buffer at 100\u00b0C for 2 min unless specified. the reactions were terminated by addition of gel loading dye, and the cleavage products were resolved by a 20% denaturing gel and visualized by phosphorimagery. reticulocyte lysate system (Progema) was used to generate the shifted and non-shifted protein products. a total of 5 l reaction containing 250 ng of capped reporter mRNA, 2.5 l of reticulocyte lysate and 0.2 l of 10 Ci/l 35S-labeled methionine (NEN) was incubated at 30\u00b0C for 1.5 h. the samples were then resolved by 12% SDS polyacryl DU177 possessed substantial 1 PRF activity in vivo. the high 1 PRF activity and the well-resolved structure of DU177 make it a good model molecule for dissecting the structural determinants within a pseudoknot for the stimulation of 1 PRF. the common AACAA sequences are highlighted by gray shadow. a negative control without insertion of a pseudoknot only showed background 1 PRF activity. a structural feature found in several 1 PRF pseudoknot stimulators was also identified in DU177 (33) the residues 166\u2013168 of DU177 were thus mutated, and the resulting mutants (C166U, A167C, A168U and L2-UU in Figure 2A) still possessed substantial 1 PRF activities ranging from 50% to 30%. base\u2013triple interactions were shown to be important for 1 PRF activity in several pseudoknots. we disrupted the three major-groove triples and the two minor-groove triples by making mutations on loops 1 and 2 of DU177 respectively. the enzymatic probing data are shown and summarized in Figure 3B\u2013E. both RNAs possess signature V1 cleavage for the quasi-continuous helical region corresponding to the 3\u2032-portion of stem 1 and the 5\u2032-portion of stem 2. this suggests that the other mutants containing more base triples should also adopt the pseudoknot conformations. assay results for DU177 and CCC/GU RNA analyzed by 20% native gel. enzymatic cleavage results resolved in a 20% sequencing gel. the first and eighth wells represent alkaline hydrolysis ladder and control. mutants U100C, U101C, A171G and A172U have a 1 PRF efficiency of 33%. the stem\u2013loop interactions from the distal third major-groove triple (U113-A176U102) are less important. both DU177 and L1-ACA have similar 1PRF efficiencies. mutation on the stem base pair of the distal third major-groove triple, 176W, has less impact on 1 PRF activity than that of DU177. mutating the U of C\u2013G U triple (174W or 175W) to the C, thus forming a C\u2013G C triple (174T or 175T) can restore frameshift efficiency to the level of DU177. we used a similar bimolecular pesudoknot approach to examine the contribution of pseudoknot topology to the 1 PRF activity of DU177. the 5\u2032-hairpin portion of DU177 was used to replace the DU177 pseudoknot in the reporter mRNA to form the hTR-5\u2032hp construct. an in-trans hTR3\u2032ss RNA corresponding to the loop 2 and the 3\u2032 portion of stem 2 in DU177 was constructed separately 174T3\u2032ss RNA can stimulate 1 PRF activity on 174T5\u2032hp reporter only, but not on hTR5\u2032hp or hTR5\u2032hp-L1c reporter. an intermolecular triplex mimicking the triplex structure spanning the helical junction of DU177 can stimulate 1 PRF activity. both pseudoknot topology and triplex structure are required for high-efficiency of 1 PRF. results of 1 PRF assays of intermolecular minor-groove base triple analysis. the designated asterisk indicates the estimated molecular ratios between the in-trans RNA and the mRNA reporter. the translated proteins corresponding to the 0-frame and 1 frame products are also labeled. 1 PRF efficiency stimulated by DU177 was comparable with that of the minimal IBVm-PK. this value was higher than those of MMTV-PK (24%) and the other two AACAA-containing pseudoknots, BWYV-PK and SRV-PK (21% and 34%, respectively) in addition, DU177 possessed substantial 1 PRF activity in vivo. a negative control without insertion of a pseudoknot only showed background 1 PRF activity. a structural feature found in several 1 PRF pseudoknot stimulators was also identified in DU177 (33) the residues 166\u2013168 of DU177 were thus mutated, and the resulting mutants (C166U, A167C, A168U and L2-UU in Figure 2A) still had substantial 1 PRF activities ranging from 50% to 30%. the calculated frameshift efficiencies are listed at the bottom of the gel and are the average of at least three repeated experiments. a p2luc reporter, with a stop codon inserted into the 1 frame of the N-terminal region of firefly luciferase, was used in these experiments and will thus generate a premature 1 frame protein product. enzymatic probing data are shown and summarized in Figure 3B\u2013E. DU177 and CCC/GU RNAs have cleavage patterns by ribonuclease T2. the distributions of cleavage patterns by RNase V1 can be localized to the two predicted stem regions for both RNAs. gel-mobility assay results for DU177 and CCC/GU RNA analyzed by 20% native gel. electrophoretic analysis of the enzymatic probing data of DU177. a dramatic reduction of 1 PRF activity to 10% can be observed for mutants U100C, U101C, A171G and A172U. the stem\u2013loop interactions flanking the helical junction are crucial for efficient 1 PRF activity. the stem\u2013loop interactions from the distal third major-groove triple are less important. mutations on the stem base pair of the distal third major-groove triple, 176W, has lower 1 PRF activity than that of DU177. mutating the U of C\u2013G U triple (174W or 175W) to the C, thus forming a C\u2013G C triple (174T or 175T) can restore frameshift efficiency to the level of DU177. we used a similar bimolecular pesudoknot approach to examine the role of pseudoknot topology in the 1 PRF activity of DU177. in this approach, the 5\u2032-hairpin portion of DU177 was used to replace the DU177 pseudoknot in the reporter mRNA to form the hTR-5\u2032hp construct. an in-trans hTR3\u2032ss RNA corresponding to the loop 2 and the 3\u2032 portion of stem 2 in DU 174T3\u2032ss RNA, designed to form a C\u2013G C triple with 174T5\u2032hp mRNA reporter, can stimulate significant 1 PRF activity on 174T5\u2032hp reporter only, but not on hTR5\u2032hp or hTR5\u2032hp-L1c reporter. an intermolecular triplex mimicking the triplex structure spanning the helical junction of DU177 can stimulate 1 PRF activity. luciferase generated as the 1 frame product was used in this experiment. results of 1 PRF assays of intermolecular minor-groove base triple analysis. the designated asterisk indicates the estimated molecular ratios between the in-trans RNA and the mRNA reporter. the role of junction-proximal stem\u2013loop interactions in modulating the 1 PRF activity of DU177. there may be more than one way to interfere with the helicase activity of a translocating ribosome. the impact on frameshift efficiency depends on their relative position to the helical junction. a single-molecule unfolding analysis of a set of DU177 variants, with 1 PRF efficiency ranging from 50 to 0%, reveals a correlation between pseudoknot mechanical stability and frameshift efficiency. the stimulation of 1 PRF activity by a bimolecular pseudoknot mimicking DU177 suggests an enhancement role for the pseudoknot topology in 1 PRF activity. loops can be efficiently generated by the junction-flanking stem\u2013loop interactions. this restricts the rotational flexibility between stems 2 and 1. adenine stacking interactions described above can be put in place easily. however, the bimolecular pseudoknot construct maintains one loop. the bimolecular pseudoknot provides a workable platform to explore the possibility of specific stimulator-ribosomal helicase interaction during 1 PRF. however, the regulation of 1 PRF in-trans shown here raises the possibility that non-coding RNA may use a similar mechanism to regulate gene expression. junction-proximal stem\u2013loop interactions in modulating the 1 PRF activity of DU177. there may be more than one way to interfere with the helicase activity of a translocating ribosome. the impact on frameshift efficiency depends on their relative position to the helical junction. interactions will provide extra restraints during the unwinding of stem 1 by ribosome. both the helical geometry of a pseudoknot and its ability to against deformation by a ribosome can be affected by the stem\u2013loop interaction in a position-dependent way. loop 2 to stem 1 adenine stacking interactions can be efficiently generated by the junction-flanking stem\u2013loop interactions. this restricts the rotational flexibility between stems 2 and 1 as proposed in the torsional restraint hypothesis (18). removing one loop-closure constraint from DU177 can reduce 1 PRF efficiency dramatically, and thus underscores the importance of pseudoknot topology in 1 PRF. the bimolecular pseudoknot provides a workable platform to explore the possibility of specific stimulator-ribosomal helicase interaction during 1 PRF. the regulation of 1 PRF in-trans shown here raises the possibility that non-coding RNA may use a similar mechanism to regulate gene expression."}
