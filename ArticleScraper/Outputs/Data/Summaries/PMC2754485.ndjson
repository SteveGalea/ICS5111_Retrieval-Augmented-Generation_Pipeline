{"summary": "the highest PCT (PCTmax) levels were less than 0.1 g/L in 3/32 (9%) patients and greater than 0.25 g/L in 22/32 (69%) patients. the highest PCT levels were less than 0.1 g/L in 3/32 (9%) patients. pneumonia is a common cause of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. bacterial etiology is only found in approximately 50% of cases. bacterial etiology is only found in approximately 50% of cases. pneumonia severity index (PSI) was used to estimate severity. sputum aspirates were bacteriologically processed if less than 1% of the observed field contained squamous epithelial cells. a serological diagnostic for antibodies to Legionella pneumophila was performed. patients were classified into three groups based on probability of bacterial infection according to the highest procalcitonin level measured (PCTmax) the groups were group 1, PCTmax 0.1 g/L indicating an a low probability of a bacterial infection; group 2, PCTmax > 0.1 and 0.25 g/L indicating an unlikely or possible bacterial infection infection. a systematic search for bacteria with standard methods and for viruses with sensitive methods (i.e., PCR and RT-PCR methods) were performed. sputum or tracheal aspirates were bacteriologically processed if less than 1% of the observed field contained squamous epithelial cells. PCT was measured sequentially at ICU admission (PCT-H0), after six hours (PCT-H6) and after twenty fours (PCT-H24) hours in ICU. patients were classified into three groups based on probability of bacterial infection according to the highest procalcitonin level measured (PCTmax) twenty three patients (68%) had severe or very severe COPD. eleven patients had received antibiotics within the 24 hours preceding ICU admission. invasive mechanical ventilation in 20 (58%) patients. 6 [4-10] 6 [411] 6 [4-10] Comorbidities, no (%) Current smokers, 11(32) 0 4(57) 7(32) Chronic alcohol abuse 8(24) 2(66) 1(14) 4(18) Obesity 12(35) 3(100) 2(29) 5(23) Coronary artery disease 14(41) 1(33) 3(43) 9(41) Hypertensive heart disease 17(50) 1( ICU admission, no (%) Dyspnea 34(100) 3(100) 7(100) 22(100) Cough 11(32) 1(33) 3(43) 7(32) Sputum 16(47) 2(66) 3(43) 11(50) Rales 15(44) 1(33) 1(14) 12(55) Wheezing 16(47) 2(66) 6(86) 7(32) Body temperature, \u00b0C 37.3 PCT-H0 levels were not different in patients who had received antibiotics within the month or 24 hours prior to ICU admission. no association was found between PCT-H0 levels and presence or absence of sputum and cough. PCTmax levels and bacterial findings Figure 1 depicts bacterial findings according to PCTmax levels. the dynamics of PCT measurements and bacterial findings are shown. bacterial co-infection was detected in 3 cases. patients and baseline characteristics During the study period, 80 COPD patients were admitted to the ICU, 34 had pneumonia. baseline characteristics of the pneumonic AECOPD patients are shown in Table 1.

PCTmax levels and bacterial findings Figure 1 depicts bacterial findings according to PCTmax levels. Fifteen (44%) patients had microbiologically-confirmed pneumonia. study examined microbiological findings and PCT levels in critically ill COPD patients admitted for pneumonia. PCT level 0.1 g/L could indicate a low probability of bacterial infection in approximately 10% of patients (3/32) bacteria were detected in more than half of patients with PCT levels. this suggests a PCT level cut-off > 0.1 g/L rather than > 0.25 g/L may be more appropriate for initiating antibiotics in a PCT based antibiotic strategy in critically ill COPD patients. 0.1 g/L suggests a low probability of a bacterial infection. a subset of patients with PCT levels between 0.1 and 0.25 g/L had a documented bacterial infection. a procalcitonin-based antibiotic strategy should have only a limited impact on the decision to initiate antibiotics in this setting. the authors thank the nursing staff of the Lemi\u00e8re and Babinski units for their important contributions during the conduction of this study. this study was funded by an academic unrestricted grant from the Caen C\u00f4te de Nacre University hospital."}
