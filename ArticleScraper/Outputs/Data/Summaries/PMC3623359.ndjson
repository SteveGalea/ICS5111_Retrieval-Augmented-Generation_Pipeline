{"summary": "the Flaviviridae family comprises a group of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses that contain three genera. the genus contains several important human pathogens, including dengue virus (DENV), west Nile virus (WNV), japan encephalitis virus (JEV), yellow fever virus (YFV) and tick-borne TBEV. the spread of dengue disease is thought to be due to many factors, including population growth, urbanization, migration, international transportation DF has often been referred to as breakbone fever due to the aches and pain associated with the disease. recovery can be associated with depression and prolonged fatigue (5, 6). cases of severe disease are referred to as dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA is cleaved into three structural and seven nonstructural proteins. the structural proteins, capsid (C), membrane (M) and envelope (E) are primarily involved in viral particle formation (18), while the nonstructural proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5 are involved in viral RNA replication and viral assembly. Vero, A549, BSC40, BHK, C6/36, HeLa, L929, MDCK, and MDBK cells were acquired from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) Huh-7 cells were obtained from Japan Health Sciences Foundation (Tokyo, Japan) bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) strain NADL (VR-534), modoc virus strain M544 (VR-415), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 (VR-764), influenza virus A strain A/PR/8/34 (VR-1469), Sindbis virus strain AR-339 (VR-1585) and herpes simplex virus strain KOS (VR-1493) were obtained from ATCC. absorbance measured at 595 nm on an Envision multilabel reader (PerkinElmer) dilutions prepared in DMSO were added at eight different concentrations. final DMSO concentration in all samples was 0.5%. cell monolayers with compound were infected with DENV-2 at a MOI of 0.1. the plates were incubated overnight (28\u00b0C with 5% CO2 for C6/36 cells) and then incubated with various concentrations of ST-610 for 48 h (96 h for MDBK cells). Resazurin (470 M) was added at 10% of the total assay volume and incubated for 5 to 6 h, after which absorbance was read on an EnVision multilabel reader at 570/600 nm. the plates were incubated for 5 days for Modoc virus, 7 days for DENV-2 and DENV-4, and 10 days for DENV-1 and DENV-3. cells were seeded at 1 105 cells/well, infected at a MOI of 0.01, and incubated. the cells were fixed and stained as described above. the plates were incubated for 1.6 (Sindbis virus), 2 (HSV and vvGFP), or 4 (BVDV) days. the cells were fixed and stained as described above. the ELISA was performed using a 1:100 dilution of mouse monoclonal antibody. vero cells were seeded in 24-well plates at 3 104 cells per well. the virus inoculum was replaced with MEM supplemented with 1% FBS. at 48 hpi, the supernatant was harvested and plaque titrated. bacterial tester strains TA-98, TA-100, TA-1535, and TA-1537 were tested. bacterial tester strains were purchased from Molecular Toxicology, Inc.

ATP hydrolysis was measured by quantifying the release of free phosphate using a malachite green assay. reaction mixtures were prepared in phosphate-free reaction buffer (25 mM MOPS, 0.2% Tween 20, 0.1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin [BSA]) e buffer to known phosphate concentrations in duplicate was used to extrapolate the molar concentration of released phosphate in each sample. all studies involving vertebrate animals were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of Oregon State University. LC was performed with a Phenomenex Synergi JAX-RP column (4-m particle size; 50 mm by 2 mm) at a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min with a mobile phase containing 20% acetonitrile and 80% 10 mM ammonium formate (pH 3.5) in water. mice were housed in labeled cages (4 mice per cage), identified by ear notching. RESULTS ST-610 is a potent inhibitor of DENV in vitro. a high-throughput screening (HTS) assay was developed to identify inhibitors. ST-610 inhibited DENV replication in multiple cell lines. ST-610 produced a dose-dependent decrease in the steady-state level of viral RNA at 48 hpi. the culture medium was collected at 48 hpi, and the viral titers were determined by plaque assay. the data are mean values standard deviations (SD) for 3 independent experiments. ST-610 selectively inhibits flaviviruses. the antiviral potency and selectivity of ST-610 was measured against a panel of viruses representing different virus families. ST-610 did not inhibit viruses from families outside Flaviviridae. red Sindbis virus Togaviridae +ssRNA >25 CPE Venezuelan equine encephalitis virusb Togaviridae +ssRNA 10.1 Neutral red Influenza virus Orthomyxoviridae ssRNA >25 CPE Vaccinia virus Poxviridae dsDNA >25 CPE a +ssRNA, positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus; ssRNA, minus-sense single ST-610 was added at a concentration of 25 M to DENV-2-infected Vero cells. virus yield was quantified by plaque assay at 48 hpi. five separate drug-resistant virus isolates were selected and further characterized. a single point mutation (A263T) in the NS3 gene in each isolate correlated with reduced compound susceptibility. a plaque reduction assay was conducted with wild-type virus and the drug-resistant virus variants in the presence and absence of ST-610. a single nucleotide change was observed in five resistant virus genomes. the mutation was responsible for conferring resistance to ST-610. the mutation was reengineered back into a wild-type DENV-2 cDNA. Purified DENV NS3 helicase was incubated with duplex substrate in the presence and absence of various concentrations of ST-610, ST-246, or (BIP)2B. the reaction mixtures were incubated for 5 min at room temperature, and helicase activity was initiated by the addition of ATP. the unwinding activity did not reach completion based on the fluorescence intensity of reaction mixtures containing top strand 5\u2032TYE665-labeled RNA fluorescence intensity values were measured in arbitrary units (a.u.) deNV helicase with various concentrations of ST-610 (A), ST-246 (B), or (BIP)2B (C) data are mean values of four independent experiments. in the presence of ST-246, the decrease in fluorescence intensity was similar to that of DMSO-treated samples. the ATPase activity of the DENV NS3 helicase was not inhibited by ST-610 in the presence or absence of PolyU (15 M), consistent with published results. the compound does not appear to have a measurable effect on the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of the DENV NS3 protein. -610 at 100 mg/kg of body weight in strain 129 mice generated peak plasma drug concentrations of 5,170 and 8,390 ng/ml. the area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve was greatest in mice administered ST-610 via the i.p. route. the absolute oral bioavailability of ST-610 was 7%.

ST-610 is a potent and relatively specific inhibitor of DENV replication. peak plasma drug levels were 64-fold above in vitro EC50s. peak plasma drug concentrations were 15-fold higher relative to oral delivery of ST-610. alanine-to-threonine change at position 263 appeared to correlate with reduced compound susceptibility. a threonine residue at position 264 has been purported to hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl of the ribose moiety of the RNA substrate (35) ST-610 appeared to have a dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the RNA unwinding activity, but not the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of purified NS3. a benzimidazole-phenyl-carboxamide compound, (BIP)2B, partially inhibited both DENV NS3 helicase unwinding and ATPase activity."}
