{"summary": "hepatitis is the leading cause of human morbidity and mortality worldwide. patients develop acute hepatitis, which may progress to fulminant hepatic failure (FHF) in a small number of patients or chronic end stage liver disease and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) despite major advances in the development of anti-viral therapy for HCV, 40\u201350% of patients remain nonresponsive to treatment. studies have shown that patients with chronic HBV disease have elevated plasma levels of FGL2 and increased expression of fgl2 mRNA in their livers [16], [19]. Previously we demonstrated that patients with chronic HBV disease have elevated plasma levels of FGL2 and increased expression of fgl2 mRNA in their livers. fgl2 / mice were maintained on a C57BL/6 background. female fgl2 / mice and fgl2+/+ littermate controls were infected intravenously with 2106 PFU of LCMV WE. LCMV peptides, GP33\u201341 H2-Db (KAVYNFATC), NP396\u2013404 H2-Db (FQPQNGQFI) and GP61\u201380 I-Ab (GLNGPDIYKGVYQFKSVEFD) were synthesized by Anaspec, Inc. (San Jose, CA) with a purity of >95%. Isolation of Lymphocytes from Spleens and Lymph Nodes Spleens was removed asceptically and immersed in Hanks Balanced Salt Solution (HBSS) cells were treated with RBC lysis buffer (Ebioscience, San Diego, CA) for 5 min on ice and washed before further processing. the tissue was digested at 37 \u00b0C for 40 min and was subsequently filtered using a 70 m nylon mesh. aminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) was isolated by density centrifugation on Lympholyte-M (Cedarlane Laboratories, Toronto, ON) the supernatant containing nonparenchymal mononuclear cells was collected and the cells were washed 2 times. 8+ cells were expressed as a percent of total infiltrating mononuclear cells. Flow Cytometry Antibodies were purchased from Ebioscience, San Diego, CA. cells were surface stained with antibodies and LCMV-specific tetramers. cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. CD16/CD32 were used to block FC-mediated binding to FC-receptors. cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 1% Saponin. intracellular expression of IFN was assessed by flow cytometric analysis. LCMV peptides GP33\u201341 H2-Db (KAVYNFATC), NP396\u2013404 H2-Db (FQPQNGQFI) and GP61\u201380 I-Ab were synthesized by Anaspec, Inc. (San Jose, CA) with a purity of >95%. mouse serum IFN measurements were performed using a veriKine Mouse Interferon- ELISA Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. spleens and lymph nodes were isolated and minced in a petri dish containing serum free RPMI 1640 containing 1 mg/ml Collagenase D. the reaction was terminated by the addition of iced cold serum free RPMI 1640 containing 1 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) the supernatant containing nonparenchymal mononuclear cells was collected and the cells were washed 2 times. number of CD8+ cells was quantified by morphometric analysis using Spectrum V.10.2.2.2317 (Aperio Technologies Inc., Vista, California, USA) the number of CD8+ cells was expressed as a percent of total infiltrating mononuclear cells. cell staining Mononuclear cells isolated from spleen, inguinal, axillary and brachial lymph nodes and livers were washed and suspended in FACS buffer (PBS containing 1% FCS and 1 mM EDTA) cells were surface stained with antibodies and LCMV-specific tetramers. LCMV neutralizing antibody titers were quantified in mouse plasma by a plaque-reduction assay [23], [26] the neutralizing antibody titer was defined as the dilution that neutralized 50% of the plaques formed by the incubating 200 PFU of virus with control plasma from uninfected mice. FGL2 is highly induced in the plasma of fgl2+/+ mice. heparinized blood was collected from fgl2+/+ mice at various time-points. levels of FGL2 were significantly elevated compared to the naive (uninfected) mice until day 14 post-infection (P0.05). expression levels of CD80 and MHC class II on DC from fgl2 / mice were significantly higher compared to fgl2+/+ mice. targeted deletion of fgl2 leads to enhanced maturation of DC. mononuclear cells were isolated from the spleen and lymph nodes of LCMV-infected fgl2 / and fgl2+/+ mice on day 8 pi. fgl2 leads to enhanced anti-viral CD8+ T cell responses in the spleen and lymph nodes of LCMV-infected mice. hepatic mononuclear cells were isolated from the liver of fgl2+/+ or fgl2 / mice on day 8 pi. targeted deletion of fgl2 increased number of virus-specific CD8+ T cells for both LCMV epitopes. cells were isolated from fgl2+/+ or fgl2 / mice on day 8 post-infection. Flow plots are representative of at least 4 different mice per group. data represent the meanSEM of 5 mice per group at each time point. total anti-LCMV antibody responses were greater in fgl2 / mice compared to fgl2+/+ mice at all time-points post LCMV infection. fgl2 / mice developed clinically significant titers of neutralizing antibodies towards LCMV WE. liver inflammatory biomarker ALT levels were significantly higher in fgl2 / mice compared to fgl2+/+ mice at all time points. liver sections from fgl2 / mice showed a mild periportal inflammation, which persisted until day 12 pi. by day 12 pi, fgl2 / mice displayed normal liver architecture coincident with clearance of virus. fgl2+/+ mice developed periportal inflammation on day 10 pi. hepatic necrosis (N) and inflammatory infiltrates were seen within the liver lobule which resolved on day 12 pi. fgl2+/+ mice developed periportal inflammation on day 10 pi. targeted deletion of fgl2 leads to enhanced anti-viral T cell immunity upon LCMV WE re-challenge. targeted deletion of fgl2 increases early LCMV WE viral replication. but viral replication is markedly reduced after the induction of adaptive immunity. LCMV WE was not detected in either fgl2+/+ and fgl2/ mice. fgl2+/+ mice were infected with 2106 PFU of LCMV WE. LCMV NP was markedly increased in the fgl2 / compared to fgl2+/+ mice. peak of 7.80.5 ng/ml on day 8 pi and remained elevated at all time points studied (up to day 50) when compared to uninfected (naive) mice. levels of FGL2 were significantly elevated compared to the naive (uninfected) mice until day 14 post-infection (P0.05). gl2/ mice were infected with 2106 PFU of LCMV WE. plasma levels of IFN were measured at day 1 pi by ELISA. targeted deletion of fgl2 leads to enhanced innate immune responses. a similar increase in IFN producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was seen in lymph nodes of fgl2 / mice compared to fgl2+/+ mice. a similar increase in IFN producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells was seen in lymph nodes of fgl2 / mice. targeted deletion of fgl2 results in augmented anti-viral T cell responses in the liver. hepatic mononuclear cells were isolated from the liver of fgl2+/+ or fgl2 / mice on day 8 pi and stained for MHC class I tetramers specific for the viral peptide epitopes GP33\u201341. infected mice were analyzed for the presence of CD8+ T cells by immunohistochemistry. digital images were recorded within a specified Aperio Spectrum database. data represent the meanSEM of 5 mice per group at each time point. deletion of fgl2 enhances anti-viral B cell responses following LCMV WE infection. data represent meanSEM of 5 mice per group and are representative of 2 independent experiments. data represent meanSEM of 5 mice per group. l2+/+ mice showed a mild periportal inflammation, which persisted until day 12 pi. liver sections from fgl2 / mice showed lobular lymphocytic infiltrates as early as day 8 pi. by day 10 pi marked hepatic necrosis (N) and inflammatory infiltrates were seen within the liver lobule which resolved on day 12 pi. fgl2 / mice showed higher frequency and number of virus-specific CD8+IFN+ T cells compared to fgl2+/+ mice at all time points examined. targeted deletion of fgl2 leads to enhanced anti-viral T cell immunity. effect of FGL2 on the generation of anti-viral T cell responses was next examined. ens of infected mice were stimulated in vitro with class I peptides GP33\u201341 or NP396\u2013404 to assess for anti-viral CD8+IFN+ T cell responses. targeted deletion of fgl2 increases early LCMV WE viral replication, but viral replication is markedly reduced after the induction of adaptive immunity. fgl2/ and fgl2+/+ mice were infected with 2106 PFU of LCMV WE. viral titers were assessed in liver tissues harvested at various time-points post-infection. data represents meanSEM of at least 3 mice infected and sacrificed at each time-point. Enhanced anti-viral immunity in fgl2/ mice was associated with increased levels of serum ALT, hepatic necrosis and inflammation following LCMV WE infection. targeting FGL2 leads to enhanced anti-viral innate DC and adaptive T & B cells responses. increased viral titers on day 4 pi in the liver of LCMV WE infected fgl2/ mice prior to development of adaptive T and B cell immune responses. defects in macrophage function are associated with widespread dissemination of LCMV and subsequent immune mediated pathology. GL2 mediates its regulatory effects through binding to the inhibitory FCRIIB receptor, which is expressed on DC and B cells [20]. in the absence of FCRIIB, the suppressive effects on immune responses are abrogated [20]. infection of mice with LCMV WE results in an acute viral infection. increased frequencies of intrahepatic CD8+ T cells and virus-specific CD3+CD8+GP33+ and CD3+CD8+NP396+ T cells were found in fgl2/ mice which had been infected with LCMV WE. loss of FGL2 enhanced IFN responses of both CD8+ CTL and CD4+ T-helper cells. enhanced adaptive immunity seen in fgl2/ mice on day 6\u20138 pi may have been secondary to the early enhanced viral replication. the enhanced viral replication seen here is in agreement with data from our laboratory and others that have shown that FGL2 as part of the early innate immune response that limits viral replication and spread."}
