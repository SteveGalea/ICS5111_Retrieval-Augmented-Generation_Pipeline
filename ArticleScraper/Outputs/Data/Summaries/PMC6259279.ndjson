{"summary": "in this review we will focus on strategies aimed at inhibiting the cell entry step of enveloped viruses. the penetration of an enveloped virus into its target cell is the first step of the viral replication cycle. each stage could constitute a potential target for an inhibitor. fusion proteins are defined as three classes, mainly depending on structural features. fusion proteins adopt a similar overall \u2018hairpin\u2019 conformation. structural information is still missing to identify and classify their membrane fusion proteins. prefusion stalk conformation allows the fusion peptide to be exposed and eventually inserted into the membrane of the target cell. in the final stage of membrane fusion, the pre-hairpin spontaneously collapses into the post-fusion structure. this results in membrane merging and formation of a stable fusion pore. the HA hemagglutinin of the influenza virus anchors the virus to its target cells by attachment to sialic acid-rich receptors. the virus then enters the cell by clathrin-dependent endocytosis. in the acidic environment of the endosomes, the low pH of the endosome activates the M2 ion channel to bring protons across the viral envelope. thereafter acidification of the viral nucleocapsid allows genome release a hinge region is located between domains I and II. a hydrophobic pocket is important during conformational changes promoting fusion. blocking this pocket or impairing flexibility around the hinge region could impede the fusion reaction. the study of HCV cell entry has been largely hampered until the development of two functional models, namely HCV pseudotyped particles (HCVpp) in 2003 and HCV grown in cell cultures (HCVcc) in 2005 [23,25]. fusion proteins of the third viral class (class III) display a combination of alpha-helical and beta-structures. mAb is a humanized humanized mAb that binds to the second domain of the CD4 receptor. mAb is 18-fold more potent than palivizumab. phase I studies of ibalizumab showed promising activity but resistance emerged after 9 weeks of administration. this mAb in combination with an antiretroviral regimen significantly reduced plasma HIV-1 RNA compared to the background regimen alone. Pro-140 is currently in phase II clinical testing. combination of two antibodies abXTL68 and abXTL65 is being evaluated in an ongoing study to assess the safety, tolerability and antiviral activity of increasing single and multiple doses in patients with chronic HCV infection. the combination of both antibodies, HCV-AB6865, was characterized biochemically in vitro and functionally in vivo using the HCV-Trimera mouse model. pro-542 bound HIV-1 gp120 with nanomolar affinity and neutralized HIV-1 regardless of genotype. it was also well tolerated in phase I and II trials in patients with advanced HIV disease. authors suggest that EB may lead to a conformational change in HA. EB may also interact with or near the receptors, blocking this site or causing steric hindrance during HA/receptor docking. a smaller peptide binds to HA and prevents cell attachment of the influenza virus. AH is endowed with broadly neutralizing activity against laboratory-adapted HIV strains and a variety of X4 and/or R5 HIV-1 clinical clade isolates. other carbohydrate-binding agents, plant lectins and the antibiotic pradimicin A specifically inhibited HCV and HIV entry. molecular mechanisms of action of terfenadine and derivatives could inhibit HCV E2/CD81 interaction. terfenadine displayed moderate HCV inhibition, with only 27% of inhibition of CD81/E2 interaction at 50 M. Ibalizumab (TNX-355) is a humanized IgG4 mAb that binds to the second domain of the CD4 receptor. it does not prevent gp120 binding to CD4, but is thought to decrease the flexibility of CD4. this hinders access of CD4-bound gp120 to CCR5 and CXCR4. monoclonal antibodies directed against claudin-1, another receptor of HCV, were developed [40]. they exhibited efficient inhibition against HCV infection in culture cells and primary hepatocytes, with an IC50 in the nanomolar range. these antibodies may restrain virus spread in chronically infected patients. fibrosis was studied on biopsies. mAbs directed against the domain III of DENV E protein potently neutralized infection in a mouse model of lethal dengue fever. the EB peptide (for entry blocker) developed by Jones et al. against influenza viruses exhibits a broad-spectrum antiviral activity. this 20-residue peptide does not induce significant cytotoxicity until 50 M, and exhibits an IC50 in the low M range. the protective activity of EB was demonstrated in vivo in mice. AH is endowed with broadly neutralizing activity against laboratory-adapted HIV strains and a variety of X4 and/or R5 HIV-1 clinical clade isolates. soluble chondroitin sulphate E (CSE) inhibited DENV infection and virus binding to host cells through interaction with the E protein. the association of EWI-2wint with CD81 may induce conformational rearrangements in CD81, rendering it less accessible for HCV E2 interaction. terfenadine and derivatives could inhibit HCV E2/CD81 interaction. soluble proteins acting as molecular decoys could inhibit virus attachment. s in plasma HIV-1 RNA levels were observed in patients with advanced HIV disease. pro-542 bound HIV-1 gp120 with nanomolar affinity and neutralized HIV-1 regardless of genotype. small molecules such as azaindole derivatives also inhibited the interaction. the lectin cyanovirin-N (CV-N) is a protein isolated from an aqueous extract of the cyanobacterium Nostoc ellipsosporum. it targets the glycans of HCV envelope proteins and blocks the interaction between E2 and CD81. soluble chondroitin sulphate E (CSE) inhibited HCV and HIV entry. soluble chondroitin sulphate E (CSE) inhibited virus binding to host cells. soluble chondroitin sulphate E (CSE) inhibited virus binding to host cells. 81/E2 interaction at 50 M, and its derivatives inhibited up to 69% of CD81/E2 interaction at the same concentration. these molecules, tested at concentrations ranging from 0.5 to 5 M in an HCVcc infectivity assay, displayed a good inhibitory effect. these molecules could interact with an additional target involved in viral infection. a class of thia-4-azaspiro [4,5] decan-4-yl) carboxamide molecules is sensitive to a class of N-(1-thia-4-azaspiro [4,5] decan-4-yl) carboxamide molecules. these molecules are not efficient against other influenza viruses such as H1N1, H5N1, H7N2 or B viruses. they predicted the position of a potential 4c binding pocket in the HA trimer. several teams, using in silico screening, discovered inhibitors targeting this pocket, active against DENV, YFV, WNV and JEV. this was not due to alteration of the endosomal pH, but the precise mode of action remains to be determined. the molecule could be a promising target for antivirals. peptides corresponding to domain III of either the alphavirus E1 protein or the flavivirus E protein inhibited alpha- or flavi-virus infection [75,76]. peptides bind to the trimeric postfusion conformer but not to the prefusion dimer, and inhibit infectivity by blocking viral fusion. a clinical evaluation started in 2007 to test a PS-ON (REP 9AC) in HCV/HBV co-infected patients. the development of molecules targeting a specific conformation or region of the envelope proteins is severely hampered by the lack of 3D structure of these proteins. maraviroc was shown to interact with a tyrosine residue in the third TMD and a glutamate residue in the seventh TMD of CCR5. the transmembrane pocket is nearby but distinct from the extracellular domains of CCR5 recognized by gp120. but since it targets CCR5, it cannot inhibit the entry of HIV strains using CXCR4. rapamycin is a macrolide antibiotic already in clinical use for the prophylactic treatment of renal graft rejection. this drug decreases CCR5 expression in normal T cells and macrophages. it inhibits the in vitro replication of HIV-1 strains using CCR5. DAS181 is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the sialidase (neuraminidase) catalytic domain derived from Actinomyces viscosus. it is a recombinant fusion protein composed of the sialidase (neuraminidase) catalytic domain fused with a cell-surface-anchoring sequence. new HCV receptors were recently discovered (claudin-1 [25] and Occludin [26]) but their role and interaction with HCV are not well characterized yet. another strategy is to target host proteases involved in the maturation of viral envelope proteins. the peptide reduces intracellular cholesterol and blocks the organization of lipid rafts in the cellular membrane, ultimately preventing HIV fusion. in 2005 and 2006, two randomized phase II trials aimed at testing safety and efficacy of SP01A administered orally as a monotherapy treatment in HIV-infected patients. the amphipathic -helical structure is necessary but not sufficient for its virocidal activity. however, due to its propensity to interact with lipids, it may interact with several hydrophobic molecules, thereby interfering with host metabolism. peptides must be administered intravenously, which could limit bioavailability due to interactions with serum proteins. Enfuvirtide (Enf) was the first fusion inhibitor approved for clinical use in HIV infection. it corresponds to the amino acid residues 127\u2013162 of the viral glycoprotein gp41. it blocks its interaction with HR2 by competitively binding to the hydrophobic grooves of the HR1 trimer. C34-Chol showed dramatically increased antiviral potency. IC50 value 50-fold lower than C34 (4 pM vs 250 pM, respectively) addition of cholesterol group could create enrichment of peptide in lipid microdomains. yl-tagged version of pre-S1 completely inhibited HBV infection at 10 nM. more than 10 M of the untagged version of pre-S1 are necessary for a complete infection inhibition. lipophilic drugs targeting cellular receptors have also been developed against influenza virus infection. amantadine is one of the most studied inhibitors of the influenza A virus M2 proton channel. it is used as an anti-influenza drug in clinics since 1966, and also in Parkinson\u2019s disease. several experiments suggest that amantadine is significantly more soluble in lipid bilayers than in aqueous solution. in clinical use for more than 15 years, no Arb-resistant viruses have been isolated so far, a major advantage of Arb over adamantanes. clinical trials conducted in more than 10,000 patients and more than 15 years of experience with Arb in Russia revealed that Arb is well tolerated with no or minor side effects. lipids and tryptophan residues of membrane proteins are in the same range as the IC50 of HCV membrane fusion (7\u201310 M) the resulting complexation would reduce the overall speed of the fusion reaction rather than block a specific protein conformation, leading to inhibition of the expected HCV conformational changes required during the membrane fusion process. SM is another plant extract obtained from the seeds of milk thistle from Silybum marianum [120]. the extract contains multiple flavonolignans including silybin, silychristin, silydianin and other phenol compounds. it is thought to have antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antitumor effects. a clinical trial studied the safety and efficacy of silibinin in HCV-infected patients non-responders to pegylated-IFN/ribavirin. a substantial antiviral effect against HCV in non-responders was observed. a successful suppression of early HCV reinfection after liver transplantation with a 14-day course of silibinin monotherapy was reported. legalon-SIL showed a much more potent inhibitory effect on HCV fusion than silibinin (IC50 11 M vs ca. 50 M, respectively) this could lead to stabilization of membranes which would in turn become less prone to fusion."}
