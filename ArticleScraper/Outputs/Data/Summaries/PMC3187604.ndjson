{"summary": "one group of positive-sense RNA viruses are classified as positive-sense RNA viruses due to their genome structure. the group is composed of one or more single-stranded RNA molecules that in many respect resemble cellular mRNAs. the virosphere is large, complex, and continually expanding due to its genome structure. the conclusion that cellular membranes are essential host factors in viral RNA replication is based primarily on four sets of observations. first, positive-sense RNA virus replication is associated with dramatic intracellular membrane rearrangements. pharmacologic or genetic disruption of lipid metabolism has been shown to modulate positive-sense RNA virus replication. in this review, we will discuss three potential roles that lipid constituents of host cell membranes play in positive-sense RNA virus genome replication. these include: (i) providing a scaffold for targeting and assembly of RNA replication complexes; (ii) inducing alterations in membranes structure to potentially shield viral RNA replication intermediates from cellular innate antiviral pathways. positive-sense RNA virus replication complexes have been found associated with cellular membranes derived from a number of intracellular organelles. however, individual viruses show a particular membrane selectivity. this selectivity suggests a specific \u201creceptor\u2022ligand\u201d-type interaction between viral replicase proteins and intracellular membrane components. positive-sense RNA viruses induce a number of distinctive membrane structures, which include the \u201cmembranous webs\u201d of hepatitis C virus [24], the clustered vesicles of picornaviruses [27,29], the double-membrane vesicles of coronaviruses [27,29]. membrane-induced structures have been examined using tomographic electron microscopy to provide unprecedented detail. similar tomographic models have also been described for dengue virus [23] and SARS-coronavirus [20], two positive-sense RNA viruses that extensively modify endoplasmic reticulum membranes. protein modifications that induce membrane curvature include internal and external protein scaffolding by peripheral membrane proteins. for positive-sense RNA viruses, replicase proteins with amphipathic helices have also been described. expression of specific viral proteins alone, in the absence of active viral RNA replication, can frequently induce intracellular membrane structures reminiscent of those induced by viral infections. positive-sense RNA viruses have multiple mechanisms to evade innate immune system activation. virus-induced membrane structures shield viral products that have the potential to activate innate immune pathways. virus-induced membrane structures shield viral products that have the potential to activate innate immune pathways. de novo synthesis of functional RNA replication complexes in cell-free extracts has been accomplished for both poliovirus and several related plant viruses. despite these difficulties some progress has been made. positive-sense RNA virus replication complexes can be recovered from infected cells by density gradient centrifugation and the isolation of membrane fractions. phospholipids have also been shown to influence alphavirus replicase protein activity [44,87] lipids may also play important functional roles to maximize replication complex activity. individual viruses show a particular membrane selectivity (Table 1). this selectivity suggests a specific \u201creceptor\u2022ligand\u201d-type interaction between viral replicase proteins and intracellular membrane components. only a limited number of cellular membrane components have been shown to be important in viral RNA replication complex targeting and assembly. Arteriviridae Equine arteritis virus Endoplasmic reticulum [15,16] Bromoviridae Alfalfa mosaic virus Brome mosaic virus Vacuole Endoplasmic reticulum [17,18] Coronaviridae SARS-coronavirus Endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi [19\u201321] Flaviviridae Hepatitis C virus Dengue virus West Nile virus Mitochondr membrane-induced structures, termed virus-induced \u201cmini-organelles\u201d, have been examined using tomographic electron microscopy to provide unprecedented detail. similar tomographic models have also recently been described for dengue virus [23] and SARS-coronavirus [20], two positive-sense RNA viruses that extensively modify endoplasmic reticulum membranes. cellular clathrin and calveolin, insertion of proteins with amphipathic helices, and oligomerization of transmembrane proteins have been described. expression of specific viral proteins alone, in the absence of active viral RNA replication, can frequently induce intracellular membrane structures reminiscent of those induced by viral infections [16,24,29]. positive-sense RNA viruses replicate almost exclusively within the cytoplasm of cells. virus-induced membrane structures shield viral products that have the potential to activate innate immune pathways. the replication of positive-sense RNA viruses involves the formation of dsRNA intermediates that serve as templates for genome amplification. lipids can serve as functional co-factors for viral replicase proteins. lipids can be disrupted by altering either virus-encoded targeting signals or host membrane-specific signals. phospholipids represent a prominent component of all intracellular membranes. positive-sense RNA virus replication complexes can be recovered from infected cells by density gradient centrifugation and the isolation of membrane fractions. replicase activity is stimulated by specific phospholipids. phospholipids have also been shown to influence alphavirus replicase protein activity."}
