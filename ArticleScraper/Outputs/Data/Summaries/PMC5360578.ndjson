{"summary": "many viruses cause acute respiratory illness including human rhinovirus (HRV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza. influenza alone causes 25 to 50 million infections annually in the u.s. influenza alone causes several hundred thousand hospitalizations and 20\u201340,000 deaths. pathogen detection assays are only capable of detecting a limited subset of microorganisms. categorizing infection based on host response provides additional insights into the mechanisms of infection and disease response, and may offer new targets, pathways, or strategies for therapeutic intervention. asopharyngeal lavage (NPL) would reflect the in situ host response and serve as a potential target for diagnostic development. the NPL protein fraction represents an accessible sample matrix, providing a highly tractable diagnostic analyte class. a description of methods used in each challenge study can be found in Supplementary materials and have been described previously. volunteers underwent extensive pre-enrollment health screening and were excluded for positive baseline antibody titers of the strain of virus used in each challenge study. this modified Jackson score requires subjects to rank 8 symptoms of upper respiratory infection (headache, sore throat, rhinorrhea, rhinitis, sneezing, coughing, myalgia, malaise) on a standardized scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 3 (high symptoms) symptom scores were tabulated for each study participant to assign symptom status as symptomatic or asymptomatic. NPL = Nasopharyngeal lavage. Sx = symptomatic; asx = asymptomatic; mean Sx and Asx time T represents the average time of maximum self-reported symptoms. sample collections for subjects in H3N2 cohort #1 and HRV cohort #2 have been described previously. unbiased proteomic discovery analysis was performed using nano-scale Capillary UPLC-MS/MS as described in Supplementary materials. unbiased proteomic discovery analysis was performed using nano-scale Capillary UPLC-MS/MS as described in Supplementary materials. individual samples were subjected to a targeted MRM assay as detailed in Supplementary materials. up to five unique peptides were selected from each candidate protein based on average precursor ion intensity. the initial MRM assay was optimized to choose three transitions from the two most robust peptides per protein. eighty subjects from the four viral challenge studies were assayed. four subjects had insufficient NPL material at one time point. four peptides with > 2 missing values were excluded from analysis. study design All pathogen exposures were approved by the relevant Institutional Review Boards and conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki. a description of methods used in each challenge study can be found in Supplementary materials and have been described previously. symptom scores were tabulated for each study participant to assign symptom status as symptomatic or asymptomatic. a symptomatic subject shedding virus was labeled as \u201cinfected\u201d. Asymptomatic non-shedders were \u201cuninfected\u201d. four experimental ARV challenge cohorts are described, including adjudicated phenotype summary data for each. individuals with discordanta symptom and shedding labels, i.e. symptomatic non-shedders, or asymptomatic shedders, are shown. NPL = Nasopharyngeal lavage. Sx = Symptomatic. Asx = Asymptomatic. Time T represents the time of maximal symptoms. unbiased 2D-LC-MS/MS samples were processed for proteomic analyses. the pooled 2D-LC-MS/MS discovery analysis was performed using nano-scale Capillary UPLC-MS/MS as described in Supplementary Materials. peptide quantities across all ten 2D-LC fractions were summed. the final quantitative dataset for NPL was based on 3285 peptides. all individual samples were subjected to a targeted MRM assay. an equal portion of each patient's SIL spiked NPL sample was used to generate a QC pool. all samples were spiked with five SIL peptides from yeast_ADH. eighty subjects from the four viral challenge studies were assayed. the datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request. the datasets generated and analyzed during the current study are available from the author on reasonable request. a two-phase biomarker discovery strategy was used to identify and characterize candidate protein biomarkers of ARV infection from participants in four experimental ARV challenge cohorts. the initial and three additional independent challenge cohorts were assayed by targeted MRM. a total of 3285 peptides corresponding to 438 unique proteins were identified at a 1.0% peptide-level false discovery rate (FDR) a total of 3285 peptides corresponding to 438 unique proteins were identified at a 1.0% peptide-level false discovery rate (FDR) 25 proteins were selected for subsequent MRM assay development. 13 had increased and 12 had decreased expression in infected participants. a total of 51 unique peptide MRM assays were designed to target two unique peptides. retinoic acid receptor responder protein TIG1 was measured across three unique peptides in the pooled discovery data set. an average fold change from uninfected to infected time T of 3.3-fold. in the H3N2 #1 challenge cohort were measured by (A) LC/LC-MS/MS unbiased discovery methods in sample pools. targeted MRM analysis of unique peptides are expressed as relative ratio (endogenous \u201clight\u201d peptide to spiked SIL \u201cheavy\u201d peptide) rows represent the 26 host NPL proteins for which MRM assays were developed. plasma protease C1 inhibitor 8 6.4 1.8 1.0 2 1.3, 1.8 (0.089, 3.9e 4) c A1AT | Alpha-1-antitrypsin 100 5.1 2.1 1.3 2 1.7, 1.7 (7.8e 4, 5.0e 4) A1AG1 | Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein 1 19 4.1 2.6 1.1 2 1.8, 1.8 (3.9e 4, 3.9e 3) ALB | Albumin 805 2.4 1.4 CASPE | Caspase-14 10 3.8 2.1 2.2 2 3.1, 2.7 (6.7e 4, 1.0e 3) APOA4 | Apolipoprotein A-IV 7 11.4 1.1 1.0 2 2.2, 2.0 (1.3e 3, 1.4e 3) c AMY1 | Alpha-amylase 1 7 2.4 2.9 1.7 2 2.1 (2.9e 3) VMO1 | Vitelline membrane outer layer prot 1 3 2.0 2.9 1.4 2 proline-rich protein 4 66 2.6 2.0 2.3 2 1.1 (0.802) GSTA2 | Glutathione S-transferase A2 3 9.1 4.2 1.6 2 1.0 (0.902) FILA | Filaggrin 2 7.3 3.8 3.9 1 1.6 (0.061) differentially expressed in either the H3N2 or HRV cohorts are highly correlated (r = 0.871) between viral groups. this finding provided a basis for investigating the utility of these protein assays in a multi-analyte classification model of ARV infection. we used LASSO sparse logistic regression to build a list of potential logistic regression models. CV yielded an AUROC of 0.8623 (95% CI: 0.7538\u20130.9315, bootstrapped 10 K samples) baseline samples from the asymptomatic cohort were withheld from model training. applying the model to these 37 samples revealed only one misclassification error (2.7%) 97.46% TPR, with the confusion matrix and peptide weights shown in Table 3A and B. average peptide length is 11.8 amino acids. negative weight values indicate down-regulation upon infection. four of the seven sham controls reported symptoms sufficient to be classified as symptomatic, despite receiving no HRV inoculum and showing no microbiological evidence of infection. all four subjects were classified as negative by NPL MRM analysis. influenza A/H3N2 and human Rhinovirus Challenge Cohorts Four independent viral challenge studies were conducted (Table 1). two challenges with influenza A/H3N2 and two with HRV were described previously. the first phase used pooled NPL samples from a single H3N2 challenge for in-depth MS-based discovery proteomics to assist in identification and prioritization of candidate biomarkers. a total of 3285 peptides corresponding to 438 unique proteins were identified at a 1.0% peptide-level false discovery rate. 107 proteins increased at least two-fold, while 61 proteins decreased at least two-fold from baseline to time T. the second criterion was greater than two-fold difference between infected and time-matched uninfected subjects. a total of 51 unique peptide MRM assays were designed to target two unique peptides for each of the 25 prioritized candidate biomarker proteins. two proteins yielded only a single peptide that was suitable for an MRM assay. a third protein, Calcyphosin, yielded a third suitable peptide assay. 1 peptides showed average increased expression of 2.3- and 2.0-fold when assayed in individual H3N2 #1 samples by MRM. a 3.6-fold increase for the summed 24-peptide CFAB protein composite assayed in the pooled H3N2 #1 discovery dataset. colored circles represent Uninf-BL (blue), Uninf-T (red), Inf-BL (yellow), and Inf-T (purple) rows represents the 26 host NPL proteins for which MRM assays were developed. d TIG1 | Retinoic acid receptor responder prot 1 3 3.3 4.2 5.7 2 2.3, 2.0 (6.2e 4) LCN15 | Lipocalin-15 6 2.5 3.7 2.9 2 3.2, 3.3 (1.1e 3, 1.1e 3) TBA1B | Tubulin alpha-1B chain 3 2.8 2.6 2.2 2 1.8, 1.9 (1.0e 3, 8.6e 4) APOA1 | Apolipoprotein A-I 2.0 2.9 1.4 2 2.2, 2.6 (0.016, 8.7e 3) ANXA2 | Annexin A2 8 2.0 2.0 1.6 2 1.5, 1.6 (5.7e 3, 4.7e 3) CAYP1 | Calcyphosin 4 7.5 2.5 2.1 3 2.6, 2.7, 2.4 (2.9e 3, 1.6e 3, 2.4e 3) GGCT | Gamma-glutamylcyclotransferase 2 4.6 2.0 independent verification in additional viral challenge cohorts. d Included due to potential biological significance. d Included as potential endogenous control. classifier was trained to discriminate samples from infected individuals at time T (Inf-T) from paired baseline measures (Inf-BL) and from uninfected individuals at time T (Uninf-T) the classifier was trained to discriminate samples from infected individuals at time T (Inf-T) and from uninfected individuals at time T (Uninf-T) a 10-peptide classification model was fit to discriminate Inf-T from Inf-BL and Uninf-T. the model was fit to discriminate Inf-T from Inf-BL and Uninf-T. othersa 77 2 Inf at T 10 30 aInf-BL and Uninf-T; Confusion matrix based on LOOCV using 10 peptide (9 protein) classification model. four of the seven sham controls reported symptoms sufficient to be classified as symptomatic. the new classifier tested in Fig. 4 includes only 9 unique proteins. we repeated the analysis using a more relaxed variable selection parameter. a subset of proteins is capable of accurately classifying the infected state of the individual. analysis of differentially expressed NPL proteins in infected individuals demonstrates involvement in several biological pathways critical to mounting a host defense to virus infection. the inclusion of three members of the complement system is particularly consistent with an innate immune response. IC1 is a peptidase inhibitor belonging to the serpin superfamily. it has an important role in innate immunity through modulation of the classical complement pathway. complement control proteins must tightly regulate activation. notably absent from this NPL protein analysis are proinflammatory cytokine and chemokine gene products. the inclusion of \u201csham\u201d infected participants in the HRV #2 cohort provided an important opportunity to assess the accuracy of standard clinical symptom assessments in the diagnosis of ARV infection. despite the apparent presence of symptoms of infection, MRM analysis classified all seven individuals as uninfected suggests this NPL biomarker assay has a lower false positive rate in diagnosing HRV infection. targeted assays measuring peptides involved in this response allow classification of ARV infection with a high degree of accuracy. this signature may have utility in rapid screening for emerging infections, avoidance of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy, and more rapid implementation of appropriate therapeutic and public health strategies. authors declare that they have no competing interests. conflict of interest The authors declare that they have no competing interests. a provision patent application has been filed pertaining to the results presented in this article."}
