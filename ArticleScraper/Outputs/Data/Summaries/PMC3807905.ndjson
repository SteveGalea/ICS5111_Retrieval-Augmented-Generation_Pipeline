{"summary": "enterovirus consists of 12 species (1, 2), including the notable members poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus (CV), and enterovirus 71 (EV71) EV infections have a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations, ranging from mild febrile illness to potentially fatal multisystem disorders. EVs are the most frequent etiological agents of central nervous system infections, which lead to aseptic meningitis and encephalitis. CVB mutants with mutations due to 5\u2032-terminal deletions in the genome persist in host tissues. RNAs of such variants can be stably detected from human cases of myocarditis (9, 23) it has been observed that CVB RNA can persist for dozens of months in skeletal muscle or the CNS through the formation of a stable double-stranded RNA complex. three established human brain cell lines, CCF-STTG1, T98G, and SK-N-SH, retained numerous physiological properties. only CCF-STTG1 human astrocytoma cells support a persistent and productive coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) infection, an outcome not previously demonstrated for CVB3 in human brain cells. human coxsackievirus A9 (CVA9) strain Griggs (provided courtesy of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering), CVB3 strain Nancy (provided courtesy of Z. Q. Yang from Wuhan University) and CVB3 strain AH30 were grown on 80 to 90% confluent monolayers of Vero cells. rhabdomyosarcoma (RD; a human rhabdomyosarcoma cell line; ATCC CCL-136) all media were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 100 U ml1 penicillin, and 100 mg ml1 streptomycin. culture medium was changed every 4 days if the cell density was not sufficient for. cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. cell culture samples were collected at the time points indicated below for viable cell counting (trypan blue staining) samples of supernatants were harvested at various times for later determination of the TCID50. cell monolayers grown on glass slides were infected with CVB3 Nancy or CVB3 AH30 at an MOI of 1 for 24 h. cell monolayers were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde\u2013PBS for 15 min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100\u2013PBS for 10 min, blocked in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at RT the slides were rinsed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h with the secondary antibodies FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG and Texas Red-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG. cells were visualized under a PerkinElmer UltraVIEW VoX live-cell imaging system. PCR products were synthesized from RNA extracted from a CVB3 stock solution using an EZNA viral RNA kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc., GA) primer pairs Pos-Fwd/Pos-Rev and Neg-Fwd/Neg-Rev were used to obtain positive- and negative-strand amplicons. in vitro transcription and RNA isolation were performed using a MEGAscript kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions ATACGACTCACTATAGGTCTGTTACCCCGGACTGAGT 173\u2013192 Pos-Rev TCTGTTACCCCGGACTGAGT 653\u2013634 Neg-Rev TCTGTTACCCCGGACTGAGT 173\u2013192 Tag-FP CGGTCATCATGGTGTGGCGAATAACAGACATGGTGTGCT 407\u2013427 Tag-RP CGGTCATGGTGTGCGAAGAGTCT 407\u2013427 Probe FAM-TAGTCCTCCG cells were detached with trypsin-EDTA, followed by filtration through a 70-m-pore-size cell strainer (BD Biosciences, NJ) after two washes with PBS containing 2% FBS, 105 cells were incubated with 0.5 g anti-human DAF MAb (Biolegend, CA) or anti-CAR MAb clone RmcB (Millipore, MA) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C in the dark. permissive HeLa cells were seeded into 96-well plates and incubated with anti-DAF or anti-CAR antibodies for 1 h at RT. total inhibitory effects were observed with the combination of anti-DAF and anti-CAR antibodies at an MOI of 1. 103 cells/well overnight, washed with digestion buffer (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM CaCl2, 0.1% BSA) cells were then washed and inoculated with CVB3 at an MOI of 0.1 for 60 min in 50 l of Opti-MEM I medium at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. uninfected and CVB3-infected cells were cultured with recombinant human beta interferon (IFN-; 2,000 IU/ml; Millipore) or poly(IC) for an additional 36 h. cells incubated with IFN- or poly(IC) alone were used to measure the direct cytotoxicity of each treatment. the target protein levels were determined by plotting optical densities. the nucleotide acid sequence of CVB3 AH30 was deposited in the GenBank database. CVB3 strain AH30 was isolated from a patient with encephalitis complications. titers were determined as the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) in vero cells using the Reed-Muench formula. cells were seeded into 6-well plates and incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed once with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and infected with enteroviruses at the multiplicity of infection (MOI) indicated below in serum-free medium. inoculated cell cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h, before being washed twice with PBS. the relative viability of the infected cultures was calculated as a percentage versus the viability of uninfected parallel cultures. subconfluent monolayers of CCF-STTG1 cells grown in 24-well plates were inoculated with CVB3 Nancy, CVB3 AH30, EV71 BrCr, and CVA9 Griggs at an MOI of 1. s were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde\u2013PBS for 15 min at room temperature (RT), permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100\u2013PBS for 10 min, and blocked in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 5% normal goat serum for 1 h at RT. cells were then incubated with the specific mouse anti-CVB3 MAb MAB948 (Chemicon International, CA) at RT for 45 103 cells were seeded on HeLa cell monolayers. the cultures were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then overlaid with 0.6% agar. the monolayers were stained with 2% crystal violet and virus plaques were counted. RP or Tag-FP primer endowed with a 5\u2032 nonenterovirus Taq sequence to quantify the positive- or negative-strand viral RNA copies. cDNAs used in the generation of the standard curve in the real-time PCR were stored at 20\u00b0C until use. the nonenterovirus Taq sequence is indicated in italics. the nonenterovirus Taq sequence is indicated in italics. cells were incubated with 1 g/ml propidium iodide (Sigma, NY) for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. cells were then subjected to flow cytometry using a flow cytometer. a single cell population was identified by light scatter properties. heparan sulfate (HS) and chondroitin sulfate (CS) were solubilized in resuspension buffer containing 20 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 50 mM NaCl, 4 mM CaCl2 and 0.01% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cells were seeded in 96-well plates at 7.5 103 cells/well overnight, washed once with digestion buffer (20 mM the full-length CVB3 cDNA was added to the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the DNA segment. in vitro transcription was carried out to generate viral genomic RNA. the presence of CVB3 in these cells and the supernatants was determined at the time points indicated below. the concentrations of IFN-, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1) were measured using commercialized enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kits. cells were infected with CVB3, EV71, or CVA9 as described above. cytopathic effects were observed for SK-N-SH and T98G cells as early as 48 h p.i. but little, if any, cytopathicity was observed for CCF-STTG1 cells up to 7 days p.i. all three enteroviruses tested replicated efficiently in CCF-STTG1 cells. the highest titers were detected after 24 to 48 h p.i., followed by the plateau effect. the highest titers were detected after 24 to 48 h p.i., followed by the plateau effect. cCF-STTG1 human astrocytoma cells support CVB3 replication. they do not display significant cytolytic changes usually associated with enterovirus infection in vitro. the viabilities of CVB3-infected CCF-STTG1 cells presented at steady-state levels ranging from approximately 81% to 97% over all time points p.i. these data indicate that the vast majority of CVB3-infected CCF-STTG1 cells escape from cell lysis and remain intact and viable up to 60 days p.i. the results of one representative experiment out of three are shown. the percentage of CVB3-infected CCF-STTG1 cells was determined by both IFA and IC assay at the indicated times p.i. CVB3-infected cells were costained with antibodies against CVB3 and the astrocyte-specific marker GFAP at various days p.i. both green signals (indicating the presence of CVB3 antigen) and red signals (indicating the presence of GFAP) were recognized in the cytoplasm, confirming that persistent CVB3 infection did not alter the astrocyte lineage of CCF-STTG1 cells. d for 8 days, the cell-free supernatant and cell lysate were negative for both infectious virus and viral RNA. we did not detect virus or viral RNA after completion of antibody treatment. 1 cells do not express CAR and DAF or express very low levels of these receptors. the levels of expression of CAR and DAF on the cell surface were analyzed using flow cytometry. HS and CS were enzymatically cleaved with heparinase and chondroitinase. neither CSase nor HSase significantly inhibited or enhanced EV71 and CVA9 replication in CCF-STTG1 cells. CS is important for CVB3 infection of CCF-STTG1 cells and that alternative receptor usage probably confers a low rate of infection for CVB3. TG1 cells, high percentages of cells (40%) were found to be CVB3 antigen positive by IFA. an extensive cytopathic effect was observed in the cultures on day 1. significant levels of virus replication were also evident. CVB3 infection blunts IFN- release in CCF-STTG1 cells. production of innate antiviral mediators by host cells may contribute to the initiation of CVB persistence. CCF-STTG1 cells inoculated with CVB3 Nancy or CVB3 AH30 for 6 h were cocultured with IFN- (e) or poly(IC) for an additional 36 h. uninfected (a) and CVB3-infected (d) cells were set as negative and positive controls, respectively. treatment of CCF-STTG1 cells with IFN- (Fig. 7Cb) or poly(IC) elicited a modest impact on cell morphology, causing sporadic cell death. however, CVB3 inoculation plus treatment with IFN- (Fig. 7Ce) or poly(IC) augmented the effect of cell death, with cells exhibiting signs of clustered cell shrinkage and detachment. the levels of VCAM-1, IL-6, IL-8, and MCP-1 in cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. the release kinetics of VCAM-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in cell culture supernatants were measured by ELISA. CVB3 infection induces secretion of chemokine and cytokine proteins in human progenitor-derived astrocytes. further experiments were conducted using human progenitor-derived astrocytes. all three proteins tested were synthesized and secreted into the culture supernatants of CVB3-infected HPDAs. the pattern of induction was virtually identical to that seen in CVB3-infected CCF-STTG1 cells. SK-N-SH, CCF-STTG1, and T98G cells were infected with CVB3, EV71, and CVA9 at an MOI of 5 for 48 h p.i. cytopathic effects, such as cell rounding and detachment, were observed at 48 h p.i. in all three cell lines infected with EV71 or CVA9. culture supernatants were analyzed for the release of the cytosolic enzyme LDH to measure cytotoxicity. EV71 or CVA9 infection remarkably induced cell damage in SK-N-SH or T98G cells. CVB3 infection also remarkably induced cell damage in SK-N-SH or T98G cells. a relatively lower level of increase in virus abundance was detected. this suggests that CVB3 exhibited a host cell-specific, lower replication rate in CCF-STTG1 cells than SK-N-SH and T98G cells. both SK-N-SH and T98G cells were infected at a higher rate. gen was detected by IFA using the specific mouse anti-CVB3 MAb MAB948, followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. the results of one representative experiment out of three are shown. the levels of viral RNA replication dynamics of both positive and negative polarity were determined in persistently infected CCF-STTG1 cells by strand-specific real-time PCR. the results are presented as the means standard deviations of triplicate measurements. 106 0.55 106 and 1.76 105 0.13 105 copies per g cellular RNA detected. levels of positive- and negative-strand RNA were approximately 3- and 8-fold lower. the levels of positive- and negative-strand RNA were approximately 3- and 8-fold lower than they were at day 2 p.i. 6% of CCF-STTG1 cells scored positive at day 1 p.i., and the percentage of virus-producing cells remained at a level of about 3% in the persistent phase thereafter. we did not detect virus or viral RNA after completion of antibody treatment. CF-STTG1, T98G, SK-N-SH, HeLa, A549, and 293T cells expressed lower levels of both CAR and DAF than HeLa, A549, and 293T cells. it is reasonable to conclude that CCF-STTG1 cells do not express CAR and DAF or express very low levels of these receptors. CVB3 infection of CCF-STTG1 cells is mediated by interactions between the virus and cell surface molecules other than CAR and DAF. HS and CS were enzymatically cleaved with heparinase and CSase. transfection of CVB3 genomic RNA results in significant cell death in CCF-STTG1 cell monolayers. we examined the impact of virus infection on cells by direct genomic RNA transfection. high percentages of cells were found to be CVB3 antigen positive by IFA. supernatant were harvested and virus titers were determined. no significant cytopathic effect was observed within 7 days p.i. of note, about 5% of cells were found to be viral antigen positive. CVB3 curtails host IFN- induction in CCF-STTG1 cells. cells were infected with CVB3, EV71, or CVA9 for indicated times. expression kinetics of IFN- in cell culture supernatants measured by ELISA. titers were measured in persistently infected cells treated with recombinant human IFN-. bars represent means standard deviations of three independent experiments. ND, not detectable. the 2,000-IU/ml IFN- regimen was able to eliminate infectious virus as early as 8 days posttreatment. cell lysates were negative for viral RNA thereafter. persistent CVB3 infection modulates secretion of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines in CCF-STTG1 cells. chronic production of chemokines and cytokines in CCF-STTG1 cells persistently infected with CVB3. the release kinetics of VCAM-1 (A), IL-6 (B), IL-8 (C) and MCP-1 (D) were measured by ELISA. further experiments were conducted using human progenitor-derived astrocytes. HPDAs infected with CVB3 showed an increase in infectious progeny virus, with a peak in virus titer of 107.6 TCID50s/ml at day 2 p.i. and then with a plateau at between approximately 107.4 and 107.5 TCID50s/ml for the remaining observation period (day 4). to test whether CVB3 infection would lead to the synthesis and secretion of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines HPDAs were infected with CVB3 at an MOI of 0.01, and the production of infectious virus particles was tested by the TCID50 assay at the indicated times p.i. bars represent the means standard deviations of three independent experiments. EV71 strains BrCr and HN2 were also capable of inducing acute cytopathic effects in all three brain-derived cell lines. infection of T98G or SK-N-SH cells by CVB3 was productive and cytopathic, suggesting the fully permissive nature of these two cell lines during acute cytolytic virus infection. however, cells of the human astrocytoma cell line CCF-STTG1 seem to be refractory to CV al cells (57), lymphoid cell line (58), myocardial fibroblasts (18, 20) and a murine cardiac myocyte cell line (22) of great interest, persistent CVB3 infection of CCF-STTG1 cells appeared to involve an entry pathway distinct from that of acutely infected cells, such as HeLa cells. however, there was no inhibition of CVB3 infection of CCF-STTG1 cells by MAbs against the CAR and DAF molecules. removal of HS did not abolish CVB3 infection, implying there might be additional receptor molecules involved in CVB3 entry in this system. enzymatic removal of CS did not abolish CVB3 infection. astrocytes are the most abundant cell type in the CNS (72) chemokines and cytokines may also be directly toxic to neuronal and glial cells. EV71 or CVA9 infection also stimulated the production of VCAM-1, IL-6, and IL-8 in astrocytes."}
