{"summary": "asthma is a common disorder of the airways characterized by airway inflammation. the estimated prevalence of asthma in the united states is approximately 8.6% for adults and 8.3% for children in 2016.1 in the united states, the prevalence of asthma is estimated as 3.1% of adults in 2017,2 and 5.3%\u20139.1% of children in 2010. a normal pattern of lung-function growth in childhood is characterized by a normal steep increase during adolescence, a plateau in early adulthood and a gradual decline at old ages. abnormal trajectories include 1) reduced lung function growth (i.e. do not attain normal adult lung function) (23% of childhood asthmatics), 2) normal lung function growth and an early decline in lung function (26% of childhood asthmatics), and 3) reduced lung function growth and an early decline in lung function (2 these findings underscore the interaction of genetic and environmental factors in childhood asthma and environmental factors such as tobacco smoke in contributing to decline in lung function. over 100 genes have been linked to the development of asthma, but the most reproduced asthma-associated genes include IL33, IL1RL1, IL13, TSLP, HLA, GATA3, SMAD3 and genes localized to chromosome 17q12-21. 1,047 Caucasian general population Poon/201414 rs612709 C/T TT homozygotes had a significant excessive decline in FEV1 of 9.6 mL/yr (P = 0.021) 1,390 Dutch general population van Diemen/200513 PLAUR rs2356338 G/T TT homozygotes had more rapid annual FEV1 decline (34.8 mL/yr vs. 22.2 mL/yr, P age 5 and 8, G allele carriers had significantly lower FEV1 (P = 0.030, MAAS cohort) at age 22, G allele carriers had significantly lower FEV1/FVC (P = 0.010, TCRS cohort) rs4711750 A/T rs4711750 was associated with FEV1/FVC (P = 0.010) in CAMP. TT homozygotes had persistent decline of FEV1/FVC over 4.5 years. 141494 G/A AA genotype was associated with decreased FEV1% compared to GG genotype (P = 0.004, 87.9% vs. 99.6%) 390 well-controlled asthmatics in Japan Abe/201833 TSLP rs2289278 C/G C allele was associated with decreased FEV1/FVC in adult asthma (P 0.001) 641 adult asthmatics and 376 controls in Japan Harada/201137 GSDMB rs2305480 male AA homozygotes had excess decline of FEV1 compared to GG homozygotes (P = 0.020) 200 asthma probands and their families in Netherlands Vonk/201055 rs3742879 A/G AA homozygotes had lower FEV1% compared to G allele carriers (P = 0.013) 200 asthma probands and their families in Netherlands Vonk/201055 CHI3L1, chitinase 3-like 1; FEV /G AA homozygotes had higher serum YKL-40 levels in SARP cohort (P 0.01) and higher sputum YKL-40 levels in YCAAD cohort (P = 0.043) 259 individuals from YCAADand 919 individuals from SARP Gomez/201532 *Serum YKL-40 Serum YKL-40 levels were well correlated with the thickness of the subepithelial basement membrane (r = 0.51, P ADAM33 is expressed in lung structural cells, such as bronchial smooth muscle cells, suggest a potential mechanism for ADAM33 to contribute to airway remodeling. previous studies have investigated the contribution of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the ADAM33 gene to asthma outcomes including decline in lung function in asthma. uPA and uPAR have been associated with several inflammatory diseases. in asthmatics, airway eosinophils express significantly more uPA and uPAR protein compared to peripheral blood eosinophils. studies have investigated the contribution of SNPs in the VEGF gene to asthma outcomes including decline in lung function in asthma. there was a significant association between VEGF-A SNP rs3025028 and lower lung function measured over a 20-year period from birth throughout childhood with the effect persisting into adulthood in the general population. CHI3L1 promoter influence YKL-40 serum levels and these SNPs are associated with asthma, AHR and decreased lung function. CHI3L1 genetic polymorphisms are associated with decreased lung function. CHI3L1 genetic polymorphism modulated expression of YKL-40 in the airway and contributed to lung function in asthma. however, longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether YKL-40 levels correlate with other features of airway remodeling. gene polymorphisms and childhood-onset asthma have been demonstrated in many studies. human GSDMB gene belongs to the gasdermin gene family. it is highly expressed in bronchial epithelial cells and T cells. the importance of TGF-1 and its signaling through the Smad-3 pathway in airway remodeling has been demonstrated in Smad-3 deficient mice. eosinophil expression of TGF-1 is suggested in studies of asthmatics treated with anti-IL-5 to deplete eosinophils. there has been only 1 study of 419 asthmatics investigating whether TGFB1 genetic polymorphisms are associated with decline in lung function. periostin is a member of the matricellular family of proteins that are highly expressed at the site of injury or inflammation. periostin is encoded by the POSTN gene, located on chromosome 13q13.3. the POSTN SNP rs9603226 minor A allele has been associated with a rapid decline in FEV1 of 30 mL or greater per year. ARG has 2 isoenzymes, ARG1 and ARG2, and SNPs in these genes have been studied in relation to asthma. but none of the investigated SNPs in ARG1 and ARG2 showed a significant association with FEV1 decline in longitudinal observation for 10.3 years. rs528557 CC homozygotes had an excess annual decline in FEV1 compared to GG homozygotes. subjects with ADAM33 homozygous minor alleles had a significant decline in FEV1 of 9.6 mL/year. PLAUR genetic polymorphisms, including SNPs rs2356338, rs4802189 and rs4803648 SNPs, are associated with a rapid decline in FEV1 in asthmatics. these genetic polymorphisms are associated with the features of airway remodeling, including basement membrane thickness, collagen III deposition and basal epithelial proliferation. the VEGF genetic polymorphism rs4711750 minor T allele was associated with decreased FEV1/FVC (P = 0.01) in an analysis of 968 children and 1,518 of their parents. no published studies have investigated whether VEGF genetic variants are associated with features of airway remodeling. CHI3L1 genetic polymorphisms are associated with decreased lung function. the CHI3L1 SNP rs4950928 C allele was significantly associated with lower FEV1% (P = 0.046), FEV1/FVC (P = 0.002) and presence of AHR. limited studies of airway remodeling, serum YKL-40 levels have correlated with the thickness of subepithelial basement membrane in bronchial biopsy specimens. TSLP is an epithelial cell-derived cytokine that triggers Th2- inflammatory responses and is highly expressed in airway epithelial cells during allergic inflammation. in vitro overexpression of human GSDMB in human bronchial epithelial cells upregulates several genes associated with airway remodeling (i.e. TGF-1, 5-LO and MMP-9). at present no published human studies have investigated whether GSDMB genetic variants are associated with features of airway remodeling in asthma. no published human studies have investigated whether GSDMB genetic variants are associated with features of airway remodeling in asthma. the GSDMB SNP rs2305480 was associated with early-onset asthma and its minor allele was associated with decreased lung function. the importance of eosinophil expression of TGF-1 is suggested in studies of asthmatics treated with anti-IL-5 to deplete eosinophils. the importance of eosinophil expression of TGF-1 is suggested in studies of asthmatics treated with anti-IL-5 to deplete eosinophils. no studies have reported whether TGFB1 SNPs are linked to airway remodeling. periostin is a member of the matricellular family of proteins that are highly expressed at the site of injury or inflammation. no studies have reported whether POSTN SNPs are linked to airway remodeling. 2 ESR1 SNPs (rs2077647 and rs9340799) were significantly associated with the rapid decline of FEV1 (15.7 mL/year for TT of rs2077647 and 16.1 mL/year for AA of rs9340799. no studies have reported whether ESR1 SNPs are linked to airway remodeling. matrix metalloproteinases (MMP)-9, cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLTs) as well as IL33 and its receptor IL1RL1 are discussed in greater detail below. cytokines and pathways to induce airway remodeling in asthma are discussed in greater detail. studies have focused on the role of MMP-9 (gelatinase B) in airway remodeling. MMP-9-deficient mice have slightly less peribronchial fibrosis compared to wild type mice. studies have also investigated whether SNPs in genes regulating enzymes in the CysLT pathway are associated with lung function. previous studies have investigated the effect on lung function of SNPs in 5-lipoxygenease (encoded by ALOX5) as well as SNPs in 5-lipoxygenase activating protein also known as FLAP (encoded by ALOX5AP) studies in asthma have focused on the role of MMP-9 in airway remodeling. there are no studies of SNPs in MMP-9 and their effect on decline in lung function or airway remodeling in asthma. the genase activating protein also known as FLAP (encoded by ALOX5AP) has been associated with lower FEV1% levels (84% vs. 91%, P = 0.017) and higher urinary LTE4 levels (P = 0.0134) in 270 children with poorly controlled asthma. no studies have investigated whether IL33 or ILRL1 genetic variants are associated with features of airway remodeling in asthma. asthma exacerbations may trigger a step-wise decrease in lung function in asthma over time in a subset of genetically predisposed individuals. severe asthma exacerbations predicted an excess decline in FEV1 such that 1 severe asthma exacerbation per year was associated with a 30.2 mL greater annual decline in FEV1.67. inhaled corticosteroid-treated group of asthmatics, decline in lung function was significantly greater in those who had severe asthma exacerbation (2.44% of FEV1%) decline in lung function was much less in those who had severe asthma exacerbation (2.48% of FEV1%) than in the placebo-treated group of asthmatics (6.44% of FEV1%) the associations of 17q21 variants with asthma were restricted to children who had rhinovirus wheezing illnesses. the expression levels of ORMDL3 and GSDMB were significantly increased in rhinovirus-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. further studies are needed to determine whether children harboring 17q21 variants and exposed to rhinovirus have an accelerated decline in lung function or increased airway remodeling. corticosteroids are currently the most effective anti-inflammatory therapy in asthma as they reduce asthma symptoms and the frequency of rescue 2-adrenergic agonist inhaler use. corticosteroids are also effective in improving pulmonary function and in reducing AHR. asthmatics with frequent asthma exacerbations had a significantly larger annual decline in FEV1 compared to those with infrequent asthma exacerbations. severe asthma exacerbations predicted an excess decline in FEV1, such that 1 severe asthma exacerbation per year was associated with a 30.2 mL greater annual decline in FEV1.67. inhaled corticosteroid-treated group of asthmatics, decline in lung function was much less in those who had severe asthma exacerbation (2.48% of FEV1%) than in the placebo-treated group of asthmatics (6.44% of FEV1%). adequate asthma treatment with inhaled corticosteroids may reduce not only the frequency of asthma exacerbations, but also decline in lung function. studies are needed to determine whether children harboring 17q21 variants and exposed to rhinovirus have an accelerated decline in lung function. tobacco smoking affects asthma severity, airway inflammation, accelerated decrease in lung function and impaired responses to corticosteroid therapy. corticosteroids are the most effective anti-inflammatory therapy in asthma. they reduce asthma symptoms and the frequency of rescue 2-adrenergic agonist inhaler use as well as prevent asthma exacerbations and deaths from asthma. corticosteroids are also effective in improving pulmonary function and in reducing AHR. rhinoviral infections are an important trigger of asthma exacerbations. children harboring chromosome 17q21 variants were predisposed to develop rhinovirus wheezing illnesses in early life. studies of asthmatic airway biopsies have identified mediators, cytokines, and pathways associated with airway remodeling."}
