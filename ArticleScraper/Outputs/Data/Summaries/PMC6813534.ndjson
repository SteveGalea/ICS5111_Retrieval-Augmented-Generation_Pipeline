{"summary": "as of 27 September 2017, a total of 1 564 laboratory-confirmed H7N9 cases, including at least 612 deaths, have been documented globally[2]. the virus has been in continual variation and highly pathogenic strains have emerged[4], which poses a severe threat to the poultry industry. the losses of the poultry industry were estimated to reach RMB 11.43 billion (US$ 1.83 billion) in Chinese mainland from February to May in 2013 alone[7]. data collection Laboratory-confirmed H7N9 human infection cases were reported through a national system for notifiable infectious diseases in china[13]. Demographic, epidemiological and clinical information of patients with H7N9 infection were collected and investigated by local Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) staff or trained clinicians in Jiangsu were included in this study. DALY is an objective quantitative measure of disease burden. it considers both premature mortality (years of life lost, YLL) and living with disability (years lived with disability, YLD) caused by a certain disease[17] is widely used in the assessment of global disease burden[18]. the total direct medical cost of all H7N9 cases was the cost per hospitalization plus the cost before hospitalization. 1 2 A traditional human-capital approach was used to estimate the indirect cost of reported H7N9 cases (equation 3), multiplying DALYs by the per-capita GDP (gross domestic product) of Jiangsu in 2015 (p) was taken to be RMB 87 995 (US$ 14 128)[22\u201323], and weight of productivity capability ( all patients infected with H7N9 from March 2013 to September 2017 in Jiangsu were included in this study. a probabilistic multiplier model was used to estimate the total number of human H7N9 infections in Jiangsu from March 2013 to September 2017. the DALY calculation kit was developed by the world health organization (WHO)[19]. it was used to compute the DALYs of all reported human H7N9 cases at the individual level in Jiangsu from March 2013 to September 2017. YLLs and YLDs of reported H7N9 cases were calculated by age groups. the per-capita GDP of Jiangsu in 2015 (p) was taken to be RMB 87 995 (US$ 14 128)[22\u201323], and the following weights of productivity capability (w) were used. the total indirect cost was estimated by multiplying the number of total H7N9 cases by the average indirect cost per reported case. 81 patients (median, 90% probability range: 1 320\u201321 390) were hospitalized and 1 161 patients died. each reported non-hospitalized H7N9 case might represent 50.0 (median, 90% probability range: 23\u2013320) total non-hospitalized cases. most estimated hospitalizations occurred in the age group of 50\u201364 years. total DALYs of the 250 reported H7N9 cases in Jiangsu till September 2017 were 1 401.49 years, with an average of 5.61 years for each case. YLLs accounted for an overwhelming majority (1 398.66 years, 99.80%), compared with YLDs (2.83 years). total DALYs were estimated to be 16 548.74 years, with an average of 3 677.50 years per year and a rate of 4.98 years per 100 000 population per year. DALY rate was adjusted to be 3.50 years per 100 000 population per year after standardization using a global population[24]. 89 38.20 1.07 528.77 529.85 37.81 5.95 37 299 111 (5 988 554) 51.59 60\u201369 59 45.76 0.55 255.42 255.97 18.26 4.34 2 252 450 (361 642) 3.12 70\u201379 35 60.00 0.31 115.64 115.95 8.27 3.31 1 020 340 (163 820) 1.41 80+ 12 66.67 0.04 21.87 1.56 1. the total indirect economic cost of H7N9 cases was estimated to be RMB 190 923 959 or US$ 29 546 430. the cost of hospitalization and before hospitalization was estimated to be RMB 190 511 860 (US$ 29 480 276) and RMB 412 099 (US$ 66 154), respectively. the total indirect cost of each H7N9 case was RMB 289 192 (US$ 46 431). each reported non-hospitalized H7N9 case might represent 50.0 (median, 90% probability range: 23\u2013320) total non-hospitalized cases. each reported hospitalized H7N9 case might represent 10.9 (median, 90% probability range: 5.4 \u201386.6) total hospitalized cases. most estimated hospitalizations occurred in the age group of 50\u201364 years. the total DALYs of the 250 reported H7N9 cases in Jiangsu till September 2017 were 1 401.49 years, with an average of 5.61 years for each case.
