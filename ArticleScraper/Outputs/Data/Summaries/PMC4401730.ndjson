{"summary": "the IBDV genome is formed by two dsRNA segments, A and B. the VP5 ORF overlaps the 5\u2032 end region of the polyprotein ORF. the presence of VP5 orthologs only in genomes from viruses belonging to two. avibirnavirus and aquabirnavirus suggests that this ORF was generated late during birnavirus evolution. VP5 knockout mutants are strongly attenuated, thus failing to induce clinical signs of disease and sizable bursal lesions [4,10] this indicates that VP5 is a major IBDV virulence factor playing a key role in viral pathogenesis. the IBDV protein arsenal is quite narrow, encompassing only five mature polypeptides (VP1-5) DF-1 (spontaneously transformed chicken embryo fibroblasts, ATCC number CRL-12203), BSC40 (quail muscle myoblasts, ATCC number CRL-2761) and QM7 (quail muscle myoblasts, ATCC number CRL-1962) were grown in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with penicillin (100 U/ml), streptomycin (100 mg/ml) and 5% fetal calf plasmids expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP)-VP5 fusion proteins Plasmid pEGFP/VP5 were generated by cloning a DNA fragment generated by PCR using the oligonucleotides 5\u2019-GCGCGCGCGAATTCTATGGTTTTTTCCTTGGAAGGTC. this fragment was digested with EcoRI/BamHI and cloned into pEGFP-C1 digested with the same enzymes pVOTE.2/FVP5M1, pVOTE.2/FVP5M2, pVOTE.2/FVP5M3 and pVOTE.2/FVP5M4 were generated following a similar cloning strategy. mutant VP5 sequences were generated by gene synthesis (GeneScript) generation of recombinant VACVs was performed by infecting BSC40 cells with the VT7LacOI virus [15], followed by transfection with the corresponding pVOTE.2 plasmid derivatives. expression and purification of flag-tagged VP5 recombinant proteins Recombinant FVP5, FVP515, and FVP5M1 genes were excised by digestion with NdeI and BamHI. supernatants were subjected to a second round of centrifugation at 100,000xg for 1 h. resulting supernatants were subjected to affinity purification using anti-FLAG M1 agarose affinity gel (Sigma) pT7-SA-Rz/VP5KO, pT7-SA-Rz/VP53CT, pT7-SA-Rz/VP510CT, pT7-SA-Rz/VP514CT, respectively. plasmids were used to obtain and amplify the IBDV VP5KO, VP53CT, VP510CT and VP514CT mutants using a previously described reverse genetics protocol. samples were visualized by epifluorescence using a leica TCS-Sp5 microscope confocal system. fluorescent signals detected by CLSM were recorded separately by using appropriate filters. images were captured using the LAS-AF v.2.6.0 software package (Leica Microsystems) membranes were thoroughly washed with PBS, incubated with goat anti-mouse Ig-Peroxidase conjugate or rabbit anti-VP5 diluted in blocking solution. membranes were blocked for 90 min at RT in blocking buffer (BBF; PBS supplemented with 5% lipid-free BSA, 0.1% Tween-20, 3 mM CaCl2), and then incubated for 1 h with a mouse anti-FLAG mAb monolayers were fixed with methanol-acetone (1:1) for 2 min at -20\u00b0C. monolayers were incubated with rabbit anti-VP2 serum [17] diluted in PBS. after gentle wash, monolayers were incubated with 3,3,9-diaminobenzidine (Sigma) substrate solution. cultures were mock-infected or infected with different viruses diluted in DMEM to the indicated multiplicity of infection (MOI) derivatives of the IBDV Soroa strain, a cell-adapted strain, generated by reverse genetics were propagated. pEGFP-C1 was digested with EcoRI/BamHI and cloned into pEGFP-C1 digested with the same enzymes. oligonucleotides 5\u2019-AATTCAAAGCACACCAGCTGGTGTGGAGGCTGTGCACCAAGAG and 5\u2019-GATCCTCTCTTTTTTTATGGTGTGTGCTTTGTC. plasmids pVOTE.2/FVP5, pVOTE.2/FVP55, pVOTE.2/FVP510 and pVOTE.2/FVP515 were digested with the same enzymes. mutant VP5 sequences were generated by gene synthesis (GeneScript) all plasmids were subjected to nucleotide sequencing. generation of recombinant VACVs was performed by infecting BSC40 cells with the VT7LacOI virus [15] followed by transfection with the corresponding pVOTE.2 plasmid derivatives. expression and purification of flag-tagged VP5 recombinant proteins Recombinant FVP5, FVP515, and FVP5M1 genes were excised from the corresponding pVOTE.2 derivatives. supernatants were subjected to centrifugation at 15,000xg for 1 h. resulting supernatants were subjected to affinity purification using anti-FLAG M1 agarose affinity gel (Sigma) cells seeded onto glass coverslips were infected with indicated viruses or transfected with plasmids expressing different GFP fusion proteins. coverslips were washed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma) for 30 min, and then permeabilized by incubation with PBS containing 5% FCS. samples were incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-FLAG (OriGene) or anti-GFP mono the anti-VP5 serum was obtained by immunizing new Zealand rabbits with affinity-purified Flag-tagged VP5. cells showing more than 70% of the total VP5-specific signal at either compartment were scored as having a predominantly plasma membrane (P) or cytoplasmic (C) distribution. membranes were blocked for 90 min at RT in blocking buffer. membranes were washed with BBF and incubated for 1 h with mouse anti-FLAG mAb. membranes incubated with different proteins were washed for the same length of time. monolayers were incubated with rabbit anti-VP2 serum [17] for 90 min at RT. monolayers were washed twice with PBS and incubated with goat anti-rabbit Ig-Peroxidase conjugate antibody in PBS 3% FCS for 1 h. inspection of the VP5 sequence revealed the presence of a polycationic C-terminal region spanning amino acid residues 132\u2013143. a comparison of VP5 sequences from classical and very virulent serotype I and avirulent serotype II IBDV strains indicates that this region is fairly well conserved. a wide variety of cellular proteins employ surface exposed positively charged domains to interact with anionic lipids anchored to the inner PM leaflet [24] avirulent serotype II 23/82 (AF362773) and OH (IBU30818) strains were transfected to preconfluent HeLa cells. at 12 h post-transfection cultures were fixed and processed for IF using a mouse anti-GFP mAb. a mouse anti-GFP mAb followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse coupled to Alexa-488. nuclei were stained with DAPI. presenting images correspond to confocal sections showing the overlay. positively-charged amino acid residues at the C-terminal are highlighted in blue. samples from cells infected with recombinant VACVs expressing different proteins were subjected to Western blot analysis using an anti-Flag mAb. the recombinant gene lacks the three cationic clusters. the recombinant gene lacks the 132KR133, the 136KRR138 or the 142RK143 cluster. VT7/FVP5, expressing the full length Flag-tagged VP5 protein was used as a control for these experiments. a flag-tagged version of the wild type protein (WT) was used as control. more than 70% of the total Flag-specific signal at the plasma membrane or the cell cytoplasm were scored as having a predominant plasma membrane (P) or cytoplasmic (C) distribution. the remaining cell fraction was considered as exhibiting a mixed (Mx) plasma membrane/cytoplasmic distribution. the positively charged VP5 C-terminal domain is required for binding to PIPs. the wild type (FVP5) and C-terminal mutant proteins used for this analysis were expressed in E. coli. membranes spotted with a concentration gradient of all eight phosphoinositides were incubated with FVP5. a weak binding to PI(4,5) bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and PI(3,4,5) trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3) was also detected. recombinant VP5 genes expressed in heterologous context abolish VP5 PM localization in IBDV-infected cells. three IBDV mutants, namely IBDV_VP53CT, IBDV_VP510CT, and IBDV_VP514CT, expressing truncated versions of the VP5 polypeptides lacking 3, 10, and 14 VP5 C-terminal residues, respectively, were generated by reverse genetics. diagram depicting the configuration of the C-terminal tails of the different mutants. diagram depicting the VP5 proteins expressed by IBDV mutants lacking 3 (3CT), 10 (10CT) and 14 (14CT) residues used in this analysis. wild type virus (WT) and a VP5 knockout mutant (KO) were used as controls. the viruses were used to infect monolayers of DF1 cells at a multiplicity of infection of 3 plaque forming units/cell. cultures were either harvested to assess the expression of the VP5 and VP3 IBDV-encoded proteins by Western blot or processed for IF using anti-VP5 serum. the different VP5 mutant proteins showed the expected electrophoretic mobility differences. lysis plaques formed by the VP5 knockout mutant (IBDV_VP5 KO) are smaller (over 14xfold) than those observed in cells infected with the wild type virus. the three VP5 C-terminal truncation mutants also exhibited conspicuous reductions, ranging from 1.7\u20133.1xfold, on the average. plaque size reductions observed with the VP510CT and VP514CT mutants are statistically significant (p0.001). a. Plaque assays. QM7 cell monolayers were infected with the VP5 knockout mutant (KO) virus and the wild type (WT) virus. a fraction of abnormally small (5xfold smaller than the corresponding average size) plaques was found with all tested viruses. intriguingly, plaque assays performed with either normal or \u201csmall\u201d plaques showed the presence of the both described plaque populations. two servers, i.e. TM pred [18] and TopPred [19], led us to hypothesize that VP5 might behave as a type II transmembrane polypeptide [12] however, subsequent topological predictions performed with programs using updated algorithms failed to identify the presence an amphipathic -helix that might act as a transmembrane region. this contradicting information led us to analyze other alternatives to explain the PM targeting of this polypeptide. deduced VP5 sequence corresponding to the IBDV Soroa strain. positively charged amino acid residues at the C-terminal are highlighted in blue. plasmids encoding GFP (GFP), GFP fused to the VP5 ORF (VP5/GFP) or GFP fused to the 24 VP5 C-terminal residues (GFP/CT122-145) at 12 h post-transfection cultures were fixed and processed for IF using a mouse anti-GFP mAb followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse coupled to Alexa-488. a cartoon depicting the structure of the described constructs is shown in Fig 3A. A. C-terminal deleted VP5 polypeptides. versions of the protein lacking either 5 (5CT), 10 (10CT) or 15 (15CT) a total of over three hundred single cells were infected with recombinant VACVs. at 6 h p.i. IPTG was added to cell media to trigger the expression of recombinant FVP5 genes. cultures were maintained for 12 h and then either harvested and used for Western blot analysis or visualized by CLSM. the recombinant gene lacks the 132KR133, the 136KRR138 or the 142RK143 clusters. the described constructs were used to generate inducible recombinant VACVs. the resulting viruses were employed to infect HeLa cells. mouse anti-Flag mAb followed by incubation with goat anti-mouse coupled to Alexa-488 (Green). nuclei were stained with DAPI (Blue). images correspond to confocal sections showing the overlay of the two fluorescence signals. idylinositol (PI) and its seven phosphorylated derivatives (phosphoinositides, PIP), lysophosphocholine (LPC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), phosphatidylcholine (PC), sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), phosphatidic acid (PA) and phosphatidylserine (PS PI(3,4)P2, PI(3,4) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphate, PI(4,5) bisphosphat significant binding to PI(3,5P)2, PI(4,5)P2 or PI(3,4,5)P3 was only found at higher (25 pmols/spot) lipid concentrations. interaction with either PI(3,4)P2 or PI was negligible. expressing an unmodified VP5 version of the IBDV Soroa strain (WT) and a VP5 knockout mutant (IBDV_VP5 KO) were also generated by reverse genetics. images correspond to confocal sections showing the overlay of the fluorescence signals. cells showing more than 70% of total VP5-specific signal at plasma membrane or cell cytoplasm were scored as having a predominant plasma membrane (P) or cytoplasmic (C) distribution. the remaining cell fraction was considered as exhibiting a mixed (Mx) plasma membrane/cytoplasmic distribution. the recombinant protein encoded by IBDV_VP514CT accumulates almost exclusively at the cell cytoplasm (Fig 6C and 6D) the recombinant protein was found to accumulate almost exclusively at the cell cytoplasm (Fig 6C and 6D), thus mirroring what had been previously observed with the FVP515CT recombinant protein lacking the 15 C-terminal residues. KO are remarkably smaller (over 14xfold) than those observed in cells infected with the wild type virus. the three VP5 C-terminal truncation mutants also showed conspicuous reductions, ranging from 1.7\u20133.1xfold, on the average plaque diameter. a fraction of abnormally small (5xfold smaller than the average size) plaques was found with all tested viruses. the effect of the VP5 C-terminal truncations on extracellular virus yields was determined by titration of cell medium samples collected at different times p.i. the VP5 C-terminal tail is well conserved amongst IBDV strains. a comparison of VP5 sequences from IBDV strains showed the existence of only one conserved amino acid substitution, R133W. VP5-PIP interaction Data presented here show that excluding PI(3,4)P2, VP5 efficiently binds PIPs, exhibiting a higher affinity for the three monophosphate species. this suggests that in addition to the electrostatic charge, the structure of the VP5 C-terminal domain plays a critical role for PIP interaction. VP5 polypeptides bound to the cytosolic PM leaflet might act as docking platforms for PI3K via its interaction with the p85 subunit. this would provide the means to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the absence of other stimuli. this would restrict a possible competition for PI3K substrates, thus further facilitating the activation of this pathway. binding domain deletions exhibit significant plaque size reductions indicate that the VP5-PIP interaction(s) is an important element for efficient IBDV propagation. there is growing evidence that a variety of naked viruses use alternative mechanisms affording efficient non-lytic cell-to-cell spreading before cell membrane obliteration takes place. ant Flag-tagged VP5 versions harboring C-terminal deletions or amino acid substitutions. the reduction of the net electropositive charge of the C-terminal domain weakens or abolishs the interaction of the protein with the PM. a comparison of VP5 sequences from IBDV strains showed the existence of only one conserved amino acid substitution, R133W. VP5 polypeptides bound to the cytosolic PM leaflet might act as docking platforms for PI3K via its interaction with the p85 subunit of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase. this would provide the means to activate the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway in the absence of other stimuli. ivity of VP5 for monophosphate PIP species would restrict competition for PI3K substrates, thus further facilitating the activation of this pathway. this might explain our previous observation that expression of VP5 from recombinant VACV vectors alters cell morphology, promotes membrane ruffling, increases cell motility and eventually leads to cell lysis [12]. plaque size and virulence observed with VP5 KO viruses."}
