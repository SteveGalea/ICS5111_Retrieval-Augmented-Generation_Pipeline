{"summary": "severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has emerged in the middle east. the virus is highly pathogenic, with 7 of the 13 identified cases having a fatal outcome. hCoV-EMC appears to be highly pathogenic, with 7 of the 13 identified cases having a fatal outcome. coronaviruses HKU4 and HKU5 and isolation of hCoV-EMC-related viruses in bats from ghana and the u.s. (11) there is no evidence for efficient interindividual transmission of hCoV-EMC (9) however, a few adaptive amino acid changes might be sufficient to allow hCoV-EMC to spread rapidly within the human population. hCoV-EMC mediated transduction of a broad range of human target cells when the protein was incorporated into lentiviral particles. transduction was inhibited by serum from an hCoV-EMC-infected patient, indicating that S-protein-specific neutralizing antibodies are generated in context of hCoV-EMC infection. the promonocytic cell line THP-1 was grown in RMPI 1640 medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics. adherent cells were resuspended in monocyte differentiation medium (X-Vivo 10 medium [Lonza] supplemented with 1% human fibrin-depleted plasma. plasmid encoding the transmembrane proteases TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4, TMPRSS3, TMPRSS6 and HAT were published earlier (24, 32\u201334) an expression plasmid encoding EMC-S (EMC-S FLAG) with a C-terminal FLAG tag was generated by reverse transcription. plasmid was used as a template for amplification of the EMC-S open reading frame without a plasmid p96ZM651gag-opt was encoding human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag. plasmid p96ZM651gag-opt was coexpressed with either empty plasmid as a control or plasmids encoding the S proteins of SARS-CoV and hCoV-EMC. the integrity of all PCR-amplified nucleotide sequences was verified by automated lentiviral pseudotypes were generated and harvested from the culture supernatants of transfected 293T cells. the supernatants were harvested, passed through 0.45-m-pore-size filters, and stored at 80\u00b0C. target cells were pretreated with the inhibitors for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. the inhibitor-containing medium was replaced by fresh culture medium without inhibitor at 8 h postransduction. most adherent cell lines were maintained in DMEM supplemented with 5 to 10% fetal calf serum (FCS; Biochrom) adherent cells were resuspended in monocyte differentiation medium (X-Vivo 10 medium [Lonza] supplemented with 1% human fibrin-depleted plasma and 1% penicillin-streptomycin sulfate) they were seeded into 96-well plates at a density of 7.5 104 cells/well. all cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. plasmid was used as a template for amplification of the EMC-S open reading frame without a tag. the resulting plasmid expresses EMC-S with a sequence identical to that deposited under GenBank accession number AFS88936. the integrity of all PCR-amplified nucleotide sequences was verified by automated sequence analysis. active monoclonal antibody was obtained from Invitrogen. an hCoV-EMC-reactive serum was isolated from a blood sample. normalization of viral p24 capsid protein content was performed using a commercially available HIV-1 p24 immunosorbent assay (ELISA) the neutralizing activity of serum obtained from an hCoV-EMC-infected patient treated in Essen, Germany, was measured by preincubation of lentiviral pseudotypes. after 72 h, the reduction in transduction efficiency was measured by quantifying luciferase activities in cell lysates. Western blot analysis of 293T cells transfected to express EMC-S revealed two prominent bands, of 170 and 100 kDa, and a minor band, of 60 kDa. detection of two bands is consistent with cleavage of the S protein (170 kDa) into an N-terminal (not detected) and a C-terminal (100 kDa) subunit by host cell proteases. transfected cells were lysed, and the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using tag-specific monoclonal antibodies. transfected cells were lysed, and the lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using tag-specific monoclonal antibodies. EMC-S facilitated transduction of Caco-2 (colon), HOS (osteosarcoma), Huh-7 (liver) and MRC5 (lung) cells. RPE (retina), U373 (glioblastoma), EA-hy (endothelium) and A549 (lung) cells were not susceptible to EMC-S-mediated transduction. THP-1 monocytic cells were nonsusceptible to EMC cells were incubated with pseudotypes for 8 h, followed by replacement of the infection medium with fresh culture medium. after 72 h, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for luciferase activity. the results are representative of three (A) or two (B) experiments performed in triplicate. 293T cells were transfected with empty plasmids or plasmids expressing the indicated coronavirus receptors. the cells were then transduced with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes. the cells were then transduced with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes. we used ammonium chloride and MDL28170 to determine which host cell factors trigger EMC-S for virus-cell fusion. the murine leukemia virus envelope protein (MLV-Env) is triggered by receptor engagement for membrane fusion. transduction mediated by MLV-Env was not blocked by any of the agents tested. TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein of human coronavirus EMC. cleavage activates SARS-S for cathepsin B/L-independent host cell entry. similar results obtained in another experiment using different pseudotype preparations. western blot analysis of EMC-S bearing VLPs revealed that EMC-S cleavage products were incorporated into the viral membrane. thus, the EMC-S fragments of 170 and 100 kDa detected in control VLPs were partially replaced by prominent fragments of 40 and 90 kDa in VLPs generated in cells coexpressing HAT and TMPRSS2 respectively. ved EMC-S forms into lentiviral particles was assessed by coexpression of EMC-S (with a C-terminal V5 tag) with the indicated proteases and HIV-1 Gag. luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured at 72 h postinfection. incubation of empty plasmid-transfected target cells with TMPRSS2 alone reduced transduction efficiency. incubation of empty plasmid-transfected target cells with TMPRSS2 alone markedly reduced transduction efficiency. TMPRSS2 can activate EMC-S for cathepsin B/L-independent entry. a combination of camostat and MDL28170 was required to reduce transduction efficiency to background levels. the serum from a human coronavirus EMC-infected patient contains neutralizing antibodies. the generation of neutralizing antibodies might be important for the control of hCoV-EMC infection. retroviral particles pseudotyped with S proteins have been used successfully to characterize the host cell entry of coronaviruses. the detection of two bands is consistent with cleavage of the S protein (170 kDa) into an N-terminal (not detected) and a C-terminal subunit by host cell proteases. transfected cells encoding EMC-S with a C-terminal tag were transfected into 293T, HeLa, and BHK-21 cells. lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using tag-specific monoclonal antibodies. efficiency was determined by quantifying luciferase activities in transduced cells. Pseudotypes bearing VSV-G were able to robustly transduce all cell types tested. signals measured upon transduction with particles bearing no glycoprotein were within the background range. VSV or EMC as well as pseudotypes bearing no glycoprotein (pCAGGS) were normalized for equal p24 capsid protein content and used for transduction of the indicated human cell lines (A) or unstimulated and PMA-stimulated THP-1 cells. cells were incubated with pseudotypes for 8 h, followed by replacement of the infection medium with fresh culture medium. after 72 h, cell lysates were prepared and analyzed for lucifera 293T cells were transfected with empty plasmids or plasmids expressing the indicated coronavirus receptors. the cells were then transduced with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes. the cells were then transduced with infectivity-normalized pseudotypes. somotropic agents such as ammonium chloride block entry of viruses which require cathepsin B/L activity for entry. protease inhibitors such as MDL28170 specifically block activation of viruses which require cathepsin B/L activity for entry but do not inhibit viruses which are activated by low pH alone. TMPRSS2 activates the spike protein of human coronavirus EMC for cathepsin B/L-independent host cell entry. cleavage activates SARS-S for cathepsin B/L-independent host cell entry (25\u201327) TMPRSS2 activates EMC-S for cathepsin B/L-independent entry into target cells. cleavage fragments of 15, 35, and 40 kDa differ from those produced by TMPRSS2. TMPRSS2 activates EMC-S for cathepsin B/L-independent entry into target cells. in, and lysates were analyzed by Western blotting using a V5 antibody or a -actin antibody as a loading control. luciferase activities in cell lysates were measured at 72 h postinfection. cleavage results were observed in two independent experiments. we performed inhibition analyses with MDL28170 and camostat mesylate (camostat), an inhibitor of cathepsin B/L (22), and a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 (28). incubation of empty plasmid-transfected target cells with MDL28170 alone reduced transduction efficiency. a combination of camostat and MDL28170 was required to reduce transduction efficiency to background levels. TMPRSS2 and cathepsin B/L can activate EMC-S for entry into naturally susceptible cells. the serum from a human coronavirus EMC-infected patient contains neutralizing antibodies. the outbreak of hCoV-EMC in Saudi Arabia raises concerns that a SARS-like pandemic might be about to unfold. a broad panel of human cell lines is susceptible to EMC-S-driven transduction, suggesting that the viral receptor is broadly expressed. pseudotyping has been used successfully in the past to study host cell entry of highly pathogenic viruses. hCoV-EMC was efficiently incorporated into lentiviral particles. pseudotypes bearing EMC-S were able to readily transduce a panel of human cell lines, including cells derived from the colon, liver, kidney, and lung. coronavirus S proteins characterized so far are class I membrane fusion proteins. a characteristic of class I membrane fusion proteins is their need for proteolytic activation (40) the proteins are synthesized as inactive precursors which transit into an active state only upon proteolysis. transmembrane serine proteases TMPRSS2 and HAT also activate SARS-S. activation by TMPRSS2 renders SARS-S-mediated entry cathepsin B/L independent. the nature of the responsible proteolytic activity and biological relevance of cleavage are unknown at present. serum from an hCoV-EMC-infected patient specifically neutralized EMC-S but not VSV-G or SARS-S. the simple detection of neutralizing activity present in human serum suggests that this tool might prove useful in determining the frequency of hCoV-EMC infection in patients."}
