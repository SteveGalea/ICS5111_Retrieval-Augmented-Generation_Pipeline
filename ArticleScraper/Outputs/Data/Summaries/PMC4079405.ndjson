{"summary": "idiopathic pulmonary lesions characterized by lymphohistiocytic interstitial pneumonia with prominent lymphoid perivascular cuffs in laboratory rats. lymphohistiocytic nature and eventual resolution of the lesions indicated an infectious etiology. the pulmonary lesions were reproduced in rats inoculated with the cultured cells. previous studies have provided convincing evidence that Pneumocystis carinii (P. carinii) causes infectious interstitial pneumonia in immunocompetent laboratory rats (7,8). inflammatory lesions have been observed in the lungs of immunocompetent laboratory rats. Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 250\u2013260 g were obtained from Samtako Bio Korea, Inc. (Osan, Korea) no antibodies were found to the Theiler\u2019s meningoencephalitis virus group. colony naive rats were introduced into a rat colony positive for RRV-type lesions. the colony was negative, prior to and following the duration of the study, for all the pathogens listed previously for the naive rats. the colony was positive for all the pathogens listed previously for the naive rats. each group of rats was anesthetized with 50 mg/kg sodium pentobarbital (Hanlim Pharm. Co., Ltd., Seoul, Republic of Korea) after laparotomy, the bilateral lungs were removed from the thoracic cavity and immediately preserved in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., LLC, St. Louis, MO, USA) virus of mice, rat coronavirus, rat minute virus, rat parvovirus, rat parvovirus, rat parvovirus, sendai virus, Toolan\u2019s H-1 virus, reovirus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, rat adenovirus, cilia-associated respiratory bacillus, Mycoplasma pulmonis and Clostridium piliforme. naive rats were introduced into a rat colony positive for RRV-type lesions. the colony was negative, prior to and following the duration of the study. the colony was negative for all the pathogens listed previously for the naive rats. the bilateral lungs were removed from the thoracic cavity and immediately preserved in 10% neutral-buffered formalin solution (Sigma-Aldrich, Co., LLC, St. Louis, MO, USA) after 48 h of formalin fixation, the lung tissue samples were embedded in paraffin and processed for routine HE staining. the adjacent alveolar spaces and septa were minimally infiltrated with lymphocytes and macrophages. by week 5, dense lymphoid cuffs surrounded the blood vessels. by week 5, dense lymphoid cuffs surrounded the blood vessels. by week 7, the lymphoid perivascular cuffs were more frequently identified. stis cysts were resolved in half of the rats by week 14. no pathological abnormality was observed in the control animals. the rats exhibited variable retardation in weight gain. by week 10, two rats showed moderate dyspnea and severe weight loss. none of the rats showed severe respiratory distress or marked changes in behavior during the experiments. a substantial increase in perivascular lymphocytes and macrophages formed thick leukocytic cuffs encircling the blood vessels adjacent to the areas of alveolar septal thickening and leukocytic infiltrates. a few foci, foamy eosinophilic exudates characteristic of PCP were also identified. trated by lymphocytes and macrophages and thickened alveolar septa were observed. thick bands of lymphocytes and macrophages encircled the blood vessels. a number of GMS-positive Pneumocystis cysts (inset) were identified in the same areas as the interstitial pneumonia. the observations support previous data that demonstrated the transmissibility of the condition. widespread presence of P. carinii has been documented in clinically-healthy, commercially-produced immunocompetent rats. lesions in rats were first observed at week 3, most severe at week 5 and resolved by week 7. the reason for this difference in lesion onset, progression and resolution is unknown. immunocompetent rats can be subclinically infected with Pneumocystis spp. P. carinii and P. wakefieldiae are the two Pneumocystis spp. that have been documented to infect rats used in biomedical research. at least three other provisional Pneumocystis spp. have been identified in wild rats. fected with P. carinii may provide a possible animal model for P. jirovecii infection in immunocompetent humans. the data are merely compilations of results from the sample stream passing through the laboratory and were not selected as representative samples from entire populations."}
