{"summary": "interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) encoded by a variety of vertebrates have been shown to restrict cellular infection by specific viruses. IFITMs inhibit viruses that fuse within cellular endosomes [7,8] by preventing the formation of the viral fusion pore [9,10], but the molecular mechanisms by which IFITMs exert their antiviral functions remain unknown. despite having roughly 20% amino acid identity with human or mouse IFITM3, we found that two divergent mycobacterial IFITMs each provided measurable inhibition of influenza virus infection of human cells. we speculate that the functional homology between mycobacterial IFITMs and vertebrate IFITM3 may be utilized to better understand the evolutionary path of human IFITM3. sequences were inserted into the pCMV-HA vector in frame with the HA tag via restriction sites. phylogenetic tree analysis of the mycobacterial IFITMs and alignments were performed using Clustal Omega software. hek293T cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. for imaging experiments, cells were grown on sterilized glass coverslips in 12-well plates. for biochemical experiments, 2 ug/well of each plasmid was transfected into cells grown in 6-well plates. cells were infected by replacing cellular media with 400 uL warm media containing virus. infections allowed to proceed for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were lysed with 1% Brij Buffer (50 mM triethanolamine, 150 mM NaCl, 1% BrijO10 (Sigma), pH 7.4) cells were stained with the anti-HA or anti-myc antibodies described above. they were directly labeled with Alexafluor 488 or 555 using 100 ug antibodies. slides were mounted with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent containing DAPI from Life Technologies. mEmerald-Cathepsin B was a kind gift from Michael Davidson via Addgene. human codon-optimized DNA sequences were generated from the amino acid sequences for MAV IFITM (UniProt A0QLS9) and MAB IFITM (UniProt B1MKV5) cells, Transfections, Palmitoylation Assay, and Virus Infections HEK293T cells were obtained from the ATCC and were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for imaging experiments, cells were grown in 12-well or 6-well plates. influenza viruses strains A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (H1N1, known as PR8) and the PR8 H3N2 reassortant virus strain X-31 were grown in 10-day embryonated eggs for 48 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were infected by replacing cellular media with 400 uL warm media containing virus. infections allowed to proceed for 6 h at 37 \u00b0C before collection of cells. Western blotting was performed with anti-HA antibody (Covance, Dedham, MA, USA, HA.11, 1:1000) or anti-myc antibody (Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank, Iowa City, IA, USA, 9E10, 1:1000) cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X100 in PBS for 10 min, and blocked with 2% FBS in PBS for 10 commonalities and differences between IFITM3 and mycobacterial IFITMs Evolutionary studies of the IFITM gene family have identified numerous IFITM genes in different vertebrates. one study also identified more than 40 IFITM-related genes encoded by bacteria, and proposed that eukaryotic IFITMs derived from a horizontal gene transfer from bacteria to a single-celled ancestor of metazoans. the amino acid conservation between IFITM1 and MAB IFITM was only 19.2% and only 21.9% for MAV IFITM. the mycobacterial IFITMs lack a Yxx motif in the N-terminus of the mycobacterial IFITMs. cysteines in MAB and MAV IFITMs are shaded red. the di-basic KRGY endocytic motif of hIFITM1 is shaded orange. phenylalanines in the first hydrophobic domain are shaded blue. phenylalanine within their first hydrophobic domains in positions similar to IFITM3. despite the low amino acid identity between mycobacterial IFITMs and IFITM3, their domain architecture is conserved along with several specific residues that are particularly critical for IFITM3 antiviral activity. a small percentage of HEK293T cells express detectable levels of endogenous IFITM3. both HA-IFITM3 and IFITM3 were able to significantly inhibit infection by influenza A virus (IAV) H1N1 strain PR8 as measured by anti-IAV nucleoprotein staining. results are representative of more than 5 similar experiments. NS, not significant by Student\u2019s t test. HA-MAB IFITM and HA-MAV IFITM were each able to inhibit infection by the IAV H3N2 strain X31. we then examined the specificity of this antiviral response by measuring the effect of these proteins on Sendai virus (SeV) this fuses at the cell surface and is not strongly inhibited by the endolysosomal perturbations induced by IFITM3. cells transfected as in B were infected with IAV H1N1 strain PR8 at an MOI of 2.5 or IAV H3N2 strain X31 or SeV at an MOI of 5.0. cells were then collected and stained with anti-HA and anti-IAV nucleoprotein antibodies. average percent infection for vector control cells was set to 1 for each infection. low palmitoylation signal suggests that it is only weakly palmitoylated. HA-MAV IFITM possesses a di-cysteine motif at amino acid positions 37 and 38 that is homologous to known S-palmitoylation sites on IFITM3. mycobacterial IFITMs are modestly S-palmitoylated when expressed in human cells. HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with the indicated murine HA-IFITM3 constructs or with empty vector control. cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-HA antibody. both phenylalanines conserved within IFITM3\u2019s first hydrophobic domain. mutation of both residues eliminated dimerization and decreased antiviral activity. both phenylalanines serve a redundant purpose and that IFITM dimerization promotes antiviral activity. Western blotting of the cell lysates confirmed the equal input amounts of HA-MAV IFITM and the presence of myc-IFITM3. anti-HA staining provided visualization of the mycobacterial IFITMs while anti-myc staining allowed visualization of IFITM3. we examined the co-localization of IFITM3 and mycobacterial IFITMs with mEmerald-tagged cathepsin B. as expected, IFITM3 showed extensive co-localization with cathepsin B. but these IFITMs also localized to cathepsin B-negative compartments. plasmid encoding human HA-IFITM3, HA-MAB IFITM, or HA-MAV IFITM along with plasmid expressing mEmerald-Cathepsin B. DAPI staining was used to visualize nuclei. error bars represent standard errors of the means. mycobacterial IFITMs share minimal sequence identity with human IFITM3. human IFITM1 possesses a shortened N-terminus as compared to human IFITM3. however, the amino acid conservation between IFITM1 and MAB IFITM was only 19.2% and only 21.9% for MAV IFITM. mycobacterial species and corresponding UniProt accession number for each IFITM are denoted with blue text and an asterisk. yxx motifs of hIFITM3 and mIFITM3 are shaded purple. phenylalanines in MAB and MAV IFITMs are shaded blue. most vertebrate IFITMs also possess S-palmitoylated cysteines. the di-cysteine motif is conserved within MAV IFITM, but not within MAB IFITM. both MAB and MAV IFITMs have at least one phenylalanine within their first hydrophobic domains. HA-tagged and untagged human IFITM3 expressed from the same vector for their ability to inhibit influenza virus infection of HEK293T cells. HEK293T cells robustly expressed both HA-IFITM3 and IFITM3 as examined by Western blotting. 293T cells were transfected with empty vector, or vector expressing human HA-IFITM3 or untagged human IFITM3. cell lysates were examined by Western blotting with anti-IFITM3 antibodies. blue numbers indicate average of triplicate samples +/ standard deviation. negative controls we used empty pCMV-HA vector and overexpression of murine HA-IRGM1 as a positive control. HA-IRGM1 had no effect on infection as compared to the vector control. HA-IFITM3 dramatically lowered the rate of infection. HEK293T cells were transfected overnight with equal amounts of empty vector or vector expressing human HA-IFITM3, HA-MAB IFITM3 or HA-MAV IFITM. lysates were analyzed by Western blotting with anti-HA antibody staining and anti-GAPDH staining as a loading control. cells were then collected and stained with anti-HA and anti-IAV nucleoprotein antibodies. both HA-MAB IFITM and HA-MAV IFITM showed a fluorescent palmitoylation signal above that of the vector control and a non-palmitoylated mutant of HA-IFITM3. both of the mycobacterial IFITMs showed lower palmitoylation signal than HA-IFITM3, and its low palmitoylation signal suggests that it is only weakly palmitoylated (Figure 4A). mutant of IFITM3 lost a significant portion of its antiviral activity compared to wild type IFITM3. non-palmitoylated mutant also partially lost antiviral activity. this suggests a common mechanism of antiviral action between MAV IFITM and IFITM3. cells were infected for 6 h with IAV strain PR8 at an MOI of 2.5. the average percent infection of triplicate samples was graphed. error bars represent standard errors of the means. HA-MAB IFITM and HA-MAV IFITM co-localize with myc-IFITM3 in cells as visualized by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. the ability to interact may be a conserved aspect contributing to the functional homology between mycobacterial IFITMs and IFITM3. the strong localization of IFITM3 to endolysosomes is due in large measure to the presence of a Yxx motif within its N-terminus that interacts with endocytic adaptor complexes. this motif is highly conserved in vertebrate IFITMs [29], but is not present in the mycobacterial IFITMs. mycobacterial IFITMs localize to lysosomes less efficiently than IFITM3. this localization phenotype may contribute to reduced antiviral activity of the mycobacterial IFITMs. the exact evolutionary origin of vertebrate IFITMs is unknown. an IFITM with a splicing pattern is conserved in all metazoans. this may suggest that IFITMs emerged in a common ancestor of metazoans and Monosiga brevicollis. the precise mechanism of antiviral action of IFITMs is currently unknown. the precise mechanism of antiviral action of IFITMs is also currently unknown. the precise mechanism of antiviral action of IFITMs is currently unknown. IFITM3 may directly alter fluidity of endolysosomal membranes [9,10,49] through the insertion of its intramembrane domain. two, IFITM3 may alter membrane cholesterol levels by interacting with VAPA, a protein involved in cholesterol homeostasis."}
