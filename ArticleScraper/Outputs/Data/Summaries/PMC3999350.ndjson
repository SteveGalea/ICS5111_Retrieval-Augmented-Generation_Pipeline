{"summary": "NNPDS is a diarrhoeic syndrome affecting piglets within the first week of life. it is not caused by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), Clostridium perfringens (C. difficile), rotavirus A, coronavirus, Cystoisospora suis, Strongyloides ransomi or Cryptosporidium spp. study showed significant dissimilarities in the course of diarrhoea between the herds, and one herd was considerably more affected than the others. a microbiological study was carried out in the same four herds having a long history of unexplained neonatal diarrhoea. 989 piglets were ear tagged at birth. During the study period, 110 piglets were euthanized. five were excluded due to hermaphroditism or missing data. a total of 229 piglets (26%) were diarrhoeic on the day of birth. within this group, 50% were diarrhoeic on the day of birth exclusively. in herd 1, nearly half the piglets were diarrhoeic for more than one day. the duration of diarrhoea differed according to the parity of the sow. one third of the piglets born by first parity sows were diarrhoeic for >1 day. this was observed for one fifth of the piglets born by mature sows only. all clinical signs were more prevalent in pigs suffering from diarrhoea for more than one day. the general clinical picture of piglets suffering from diarrhoea was that of failure to thrive and wasting. primary diagnoses at necropsy in 43, 15, 13 and 9 piglets from herd 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. piglets were emaciated and stomachs and intestines were empty. weight gain Results of the mixed linear model are presented in Table 4. four herds

1.8 Birth weight (per 100 g increase) NNPDs is a debilitating syndrome, significantly affecting the well-being of piglets. the negative effects of diarrhoea estimated in this study were comparable to the -8 g per day estimated in a previous study involving the whole suckling period. many piglets (26%) were diarrhoeic on the day of birth and those (50%) that were only diarrhoeic on the day of birth were not negatively affected on ADG. the diarrhoea seen on the level of litters was the most important type of diarrhoea in terms of disease. diarrhoea was four times higher than mortality among non-diarrhoeic ones. in other herds, mortalities were lower at all levels of diarrhoea. piglets from 70 herds had increased losses during the suckling period. the most prevalent diagnoses assigned at necropsy were miscellaneous and starvation. in the last herd, diarrhoea affected more piglets, and many piglets were affected for a longer period of time. approximately 30 piglets per herd were taken out for microbiological examination. the tests indicated that the herds did not suffer from known infectious causes of diarrhoea. microbiological testing was not performed on piglets in the study. the presence of hollow flanks, protruding ribs, dull hair coats and dehydration (sunken eye-balls and loss of skin-elasticity) was registered on the fifth day of life as clinical signs of failure to thrive due to diarrhoea. four levels of diarrhoea were defined based on the duration and timing. these levels were introduced to distinguish between diarrhoea at the day of birth and diarrhoea of different duration. on the litter-level, the variable \u201cDiarrhoeal Status of Litter\u201d was introduced, in order to dichotomise litters into mildly affected litters. both models were fit in R [15] using the lme4 package. a linear mixed-effect model was used, whereas a generalised linear mixed-effect model was used. clinical examinations and weighing were carried out with consideration to the welfare of the pigs by a skilled person (HK). study was an observational cross-sectional study with follow-up, carried out in four Danish sow herds. non-antibiotic oral supplements were allowed to be used according to individual herd routines. piglets were weighed at birth and at ten days of life. each piglet rectal swabs were evaluated on a daily basis. diagnosis of starvation was assigned if the piglet was emaciated, stomach and intestines were empty and no other findings were obvious. all procedures in the herds were carried out by the corresponding author. piglet was diarrhoeic for one day during the second to fifth day of life > 1 day. severely affected Less than 50% of the piglets in the litter were diarrhoeic for one or more days (the day of birth did not count) both models were fit in R [15] using the lme4 package. all secondary risk factors and all possible two-way interaction terms with diarrhoea were included in the initial models. model reduction was carried out using stepwise backwards elimination, removing variables with p > 0.05. explanatory variables addressed in the models on ADG and mortality Explanatory variable Level Interpretation of levels Primary Diarrhoea None The piglet was not diarrhoeic at any day 1 day (during day 1) The piglet was not diarrhoeic for one day during the second to fifth day of life > 1 day The piglet was diarrhoeic for more than one day during the five day study-period Secondary Litter level Parity weight at the log odds scale for mortality in the generalised linear mixed model was assessed by transforming birth weight into a categorical variable based on quartiles. in the models, herd of origin was included as a fixed effect. all secondary risk factors and all possible two-way interaction terms with diarrhoea were included in the initial models."}
