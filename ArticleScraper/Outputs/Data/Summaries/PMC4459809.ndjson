{"summary": "the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003 which resulted in 775 human deaths was caused by SARS coronavirus (CoV) in recent years. the discovery of these two previously unknown CoVs and other CoVs related to them in animals has greatly broadened our knowledge about the distribution, diversity, and significance of CoVs in both humans and animals. newly identified CoVs are assigned to a genus based on pair-wise evolutionary distances for the seven conserved replicase domains in replicase polyprotein pp1ab: ADP-ribose-1\"-phosphatase. this 90% identity threshold serves as the sole species demarcation criterion [8] feces samples were collected from the fresh feces in the ground. the drinking-water samples were collected from the water trough for a group of birds. the coronaviruses dominant in chickens and ducks were designated as chicken-dominant CoV (CdCoV) and duck-dominant CoV (DdCoV) RT-PCR products were purified with an agarose gel DNA extraction kit. the amplicons were purified using an agarose gel DNA extraction kit. positive clones were sequenced by the ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer. the swab samples were stored in 1.5 ml phosphate-buffered saline (pBS, pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol. the feces and drinking-water samples were stored in 3.5 ml PBS (pH 7.2) containing 10% glycerol. the samples were stored at 4\u00b0C and detected in three days after collection. RNA in feces and drinking-water samples or in allantoic fluids was extracted using a conserved RT-PCR assay. the assay amplifies a 545-nucleotide region in the viral 1ab gene. the assay amplifies a 545-nucleotide region in the viral 1ab gene. IC score is assumed to describe the substitution pattern the best. bootstrap values were calculated out of 1000 replicates [20, 22] only the potential recombination events identified by all these five methods with greater than 99% certainty (99% bootstrap support in case of Bootscan) were accepted. the feces samples, drinking-water samples and swab samples from poultry farms, backyard flocks and live bird markets were all collected with permission. the feces samples, drinking-water samples and swab samples from poultry farms, backyard flocks and live bird markets were all collected with permission. the whole genome of DdCoV/GD/2014 was amplified through RT-PCR with a series of primers. the primers were designed according to conserved regions in the genomes of the CoVs in genus Gammacoronavirus. RT-PCR products were purified with an agarose gel DNA extraction kit. 3583 samples were collected from 28 live poultry markets, 14 duck farms, and two backyard flocks in may and June of 2014. the swab sample was collected through taking smears at both cloacal and oropharyngeal tracts of a bird. the drinking-water sample was collected through taking approximately 3.5 ml drinking-water for a group of birds. the samples were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 5 min. all the hemagglutination-positive allantoic fluids of live embryos and the allantoic fluids of all dead eggs were investigated by RT-PCR for detection of avian influenza virus and Newcastle disease virus. they were also examined further by a conserved RT-PCR assay for detection of CoVs. the assay amplifies a 545-nucleotide region in the viral 1ab gene. denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 60 s followed by 30 cycles at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, 50\u00b0C for 30 s and 72\u00b0C for 1 min. RT-PCR products were purified with an agarose gel DNA extraction kit (Sangon, Shanghai, China), and sequenced directly using the ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer. gene sequences of 11 randomly selected CdCoVs used for sequence identity analysis and recombination analysis are DQ834384, FJ888351, AY641576, NC010800, NC001451, JQ977698, JQ977697, JQ088078, DQ646405, KF574761, and FN430415. previously reported genomic sequences of Bacillus cereus, Streptomyces purpureus, CdCo the 3\u2032-proximal genes code the structural proteins S, E, M, and N. the repeat is 115 aa residues long and rich in aa residues of E (n = 30), K (n = 25), P (n = 19), Q (n = 14), T (n = 14), and V (n = 10). ic with 56 (48.7%) charged aa residues, and of the net charge of 4.0 at pH 7.0. only three aa residues and five nucleotide residues are different among the five copies of the tandem repeat. no hits homologous to the copy of the viral repeat or the whole repeat were found through Megablast in NCBI optimized for search of highly similar nucleotide sequences. indels occurred in the 1ab gene of DdCoV/GD/2014. these frameshifts all occurred in pairs with 5\u201325 nucleotide intervals. identity between three DdCoVs reported herein is 85.2\u201388.8% with the mean of 86.4% 1.1%. phylogenetic relationships of 12 CoVs based on sequences of seven conserved domains in their genomes. the first tree was based on sequences of the seven domains combined together. the remaining trees were based on the sequences of each of the seven domains. these two potential recombination events were the same as suggested. phylogenetic analysis of the conserved RT-PCR amplicons suggested that these 419 viruses could be classified into two lineages corresponding to CdCoVs (n = 371) and DdCoVs (n = 48), respectively. the positive percentage of CdCoVs in the samples of chickens was significantly higher than that in the samples of ducks. DdCoVs were found in 80.0% (4/5) of the provinces, 46.43% (13/28) of the LPMs, 7.14% (1/14) of the 14 duck farms, and none of the backyard flocks where the samples were collected. both CdCoVs and DdCoVs are prevalent in LPMs in some regions in china. the 3\u2032-proximal genes code the structural proteins S, E, M, and N. there are six potential accessory genes (3a, 3b, ORFx, 5a, 5b, and ORFy) of these 12 ORFs, 10 have 1\u201311916 overlapping nucleotides. there is a 1 ribosomal frameshift within ORF1ab. the repeat is hydrophilic with 56 (48.7%) charged aa residues. only three aa residues and five nucleotide residues are different among the five copies of the tandem repeat. no hits homologous to the copy of the viral repeat or the whole repeat were found through Megablast in NCBI optimized for search of highly similar nucleotide sequences. the identity between three DdCoVs and 11 randomly selected CdCoVs is 85.2\u201388.8% with the mean of 86.4% 1.1%. corresponding aa identity is 94.5\u201399.2% with the mean of 96.0% 0.9% among the 11 CdCoVs. the three DdCoVs and the 11 CdCoVs belong to different lineages based on each of these seven conserved domains. these two exceptions suggest that the two genes of DdCoV/GD/2014 likely originated from CdCoVs through genomic recombination. the major part of nsp16 65\u2013695 a The nucleotides involved in the recombination were numbered from the first coding nucleotide of the genes. phylogenetic analysis of the conserved RT-PCR amplicons suggested that these 419 viruses could be classified into two lineages corresponding to CdCoVs (n = 371) and DdCoVs (n = 48), respectively. CdCoVs were found in 80.0% (4/5) of the provinces, 82.14% (23/28) of the LPMs, 46.43% (13/28) of the 14 duck farms, and 7.14% (1/14) of the 14 duck farms. both CdCoVs and DdCoVs are prevalent in LPMs in some regions in china. tandem repeats in both DdCoVs and HKU1 CoVs are located at highly variable regions in the PL1pro domain of nsp3. tandem repeats may be of little importance for the virus replicating in cultured cells. as tandem repeats have not been identified in any known vertebrate RNA viruses except in two species of CoVs. onavirus covering IBVs in chickens and related CoVs in birds has become questionable. some CoVs in wild birds have been identified to be members of another genus Deltacoronavirus. the designations allow that these CoVs may also circulate in turkeys, geese, peafowl, or other birds at a relatively low prevalence. indels in aligned sequences of the 1ab genes of two CdCoVs and one DdCoV terminated at sites 20006, 20079, and 20076, respectively. deleted nucleotides at the indel gaps were shown with \"-\""}
