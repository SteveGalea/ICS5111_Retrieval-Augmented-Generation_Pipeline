{"summary": "hypodermic needles are used for most biotherapeutic and vaccine injections,1 providing a low-cost, rapid, and direct way to deliver almost any type of molecule into the body. hypodermic needles are used primarily in the clinic or at home by patients who have received special training and safe needle disposal2 and other issues such as transportation are problems. microneedles are needle-like structures with diameters in the size order of microns and lengths up to 900 m. these structures are used to pierce the upper layer of the skin to enhance transdermal drug delivery by enabling the transport of a host of molecules that cannot be delivered across the skin by passive diffusion alone. microneedles are mostly applied for the transdermal delivery of drugs and vaccines that may require long exposure. under the stratum corneum lies the dermis, which is about 2,000 m thick and contains nerves, blood vessels, nociceptors, lymph vessels, hair follicles, and sweat glands. the epidermal or epithelial layer is a covering carried in the superficial dermis or superficial lamina in the superficial plexus. in the deep dermal layer, the deep plexus is carried. gomaa et al21 found that when 600 m-long microneedles were applied to the dermal side of skin, the transepidermal water-loss measurements remained at baseline levels. this is explained by the fact that typically only 10%\u201330% of the needle length actually penetrates tissue. however, increasing microneedle density introduced complex effects. sulforhodamine release from carboxymethyl cellulose microneedle patches exhibited an initial lag time of a few hours, followed by steady release for approximately 1 day. similar behavior was seen for microneedle patches made of amylopectin. the application of an electric current significantly increased the extent of macromolecular delivery from the poly(methyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride) microneedle array. ito et al29 reported a similar finding, wherein transdermal permeation of high-molecular-weight compounds through microneedle-induced channels could be increased. hydrogel particles absorbed water quickly, resulting in the cracking of the microneedles. the swollen particles caused the microneedles to completely break down. arrowhead microneedles featured micron-size sharp tips mounted on blunt shafts. rapid separation of the arrowhead tips from the shafts within seconds can be carried out rapidly. polymer microstructures have high aspect ratios required to manufacture microneedle systems. room temperature and aqueous-based micromolding allow for bulk loading of these microneedle structures. controlled release of a model drug is achieved by adjusting postprocessing conditions of the microneedle structures. deMuth et al37 reported an approach for rapid implantation of vaccine-loaded polymer films carrying DNA, immune-stimulatory RNA, and biodegradable polycations. microneedles coated with releasable polyelectrolyte multilayers promoted local transfection and controlled the persistence of DNA and adjuvants in the skin from days to weeks. the viable epidermis is located below the stratum corneum, and has a thickness of 130\u2013180 m. below the epidermis lies the dermis, which is about 2,000 m thick. it contains nerves, blood vessels, nociceptors, lymph vessels, hair follicles, and sweat glands. microneedle arrays with lower needle densities (2,000 needles/cm2) were more effective in enhancing drug flux. noh et al20 measured skin irritation using microneedles of 500 m depth. redness was generally maintained until 30 minutes. sulforhodamine release from carboxymethyl cellulose microneedles exhibited an initial lag time of a few hours, followed by steady release for approximately 1 day. polymeric dissolving microneedles delivered 83% of the encapsulated theophylline into porcine skin within 24 hours. application of current and gradual decrease with termination of current, and current density and time could be used appropriately to program a desired drug-delivery profile. it has been shown that the application of an electric current significantly increased the extent of macromolecular delivery from the poly(methyl vinyl ether maleic anhydride) microneedle array. biodegradable microneedles must be inserted and remain in the skin for several days to utilize the degradation property of biodegradable polymer effectively. nanoneedles must be inserted and remain in the skin for several days to utilize the degradation property of biodegradable polymer. in vitro release of calcein and bovine serum albumin from three different encapsulation formulations was measured over time, and was shown to be controlled by the encapsulation method to achieve release kinetics ranging from hours to months. microneedle delivery of nucleic acids, in particular plasmid DNA (pDNA) to the skin represents a potential new approach for the clinical management of genetic skin diseases and cutaneous cancers. DNA vaccines have many potential benefits, but have failed to generate robust immune responses in humans. microneedle-fabricating methods are determined by the desired property of the microneedles. harsh fabrication methods (ie, using high temperature or organic solvent) may damage temperature-sensitive drugs. PLGA microparticles were applied to the surface of the mold in an aqueous suspension and compacted into the mold cavities through centrifugation. excess microparticles were then removed, and the microparticle-loaded mold was allowed to dry. a solid PLGA-poly(acrylic acid) microparticle matrix was obtained. dissolved or degraded matrices have side effects if microneedles are used frequently. polymer microneedles for controlled-release delivery are constrained by needle mechanical properties when main matrix is PLGA or carboxymethyl cellulose. dissolving and biodegradable microneedle technologies have a bright future for transdermal sustained delivery of drug and vaccine. future studies will focus on the incorporation of other bioactivity-enhancing methods including ITP components into polymeric microneedle devices."}
