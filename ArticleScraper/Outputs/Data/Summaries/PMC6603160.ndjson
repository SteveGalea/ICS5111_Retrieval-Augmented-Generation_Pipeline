{"summary": "innate immune interferons are key in regulating antiviral immunity, antitumor activity, and cell proliferation (1\u20136) in mammals, intronless type I IFNs have evolved through a subtype expansion resulting in at least nine subtypes, which include IFN-, IFN-, and IFN-. porcine type I IFN gene loci contain 57 predictable IFN-coding genes spanning nearly 1 Mbp genomic region. single IFN-like genes are identified in reptiles and birds. multi-gene IFN- subtypes are present in most ungulate and bat species. we have characterized family-wide porcine innate immune IFNs for their functional spectrum and therapeutic potential (9, 10, 13, 14), which was profiled against two RNA viruses: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and influenza A virus in swine, also threatens public health (13, 16). samples of tissues and primary cells used for gene expression and activity assays were cryopreserved samples from a previous study. samples of various tissues and primary cells were collected, immediately snap frozen and stored in liquid nitrogen until used for nucleic acid or protein extraction (9, 13, 21). cell lines used for cell proliferation and antiviral assays were purchased from ATCC or transferred from collaborators at Kansas State University. cell lines used include porcine testis cells (ST, ATCC\u00ae CRL-1746TM), porcine kidney cells (PK15, ATCC\u00ae CCL-33TM), human intestinal epithelial cells (A549, ATCC\u00ae CRM-CCL-185TM), mouse fibroblast cells (Mode-K), and monkey kidney cells (MARC-145) (10, 13 the IFN genes were predicted and extracted from genomic sequences. they span the regions having translated frames significantly similar to identified IFN sequences or consensuses. program interactively used for gene prediction include GenomeScan and FGENESH. cDNA was reverse transcribed from total RNA pools extracted from different tissues with a superScript III first-strand synthesis system and random primers (Invitrogen) coding regions of IFNs were amplified from this cDNA pool for transcription confirmation and building expression constructs. gene-specific primers were designed and validated using porcine gene annotation. Viruses All experiments using infectious viruses were conducted in the laboratories covered by effective licenses and handled according to restrictive regulations specified. Viruses tested include a PRRSV P129 strain, and influenza strains of A/(H1N1)/pdm09 (pH1N1), A(H1N1)/WSN/1933 (WSN), and H1N1A/swine/Kansas/77778/2007 (KS07). s was tested on the cell/virus systems including: MARC-145/PRRSV, porcine M/PRRSV, A549/pH1N1, PK-15/pH1N1, Mode-K/WSN, NIH3T3/WSN, Mode-K/KS07, and NIH3T3/KS07. cells were seeded in flat-bottom 96-well plates and grown to >95% confluence. cells were treated with or without IFN peptides for 24 h. cells were lysed with Glo lysis buffer and quantified by Promega. cell growth was determined by a MTS-salt. blood (20 ml/pig) was collected by jugular venipuncture from anesthetized pigs. cubes of 0.5 cm3 were dissected from lung or other indicated tissues. samples were placed on ice and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages were isolated from the heparinized blood samples. is cells (ST, ATCC\u00ae CRL-1746TM), porcine kidney cells (PK15, ATCC\u00ae CCL-33TM), human intestinal epithelial cells (A549, ATCC\u00ae CRM-CCL-185TM), mouse fibroblast cells (Mode-K), and the monkey kidney cells (MARC-145) (10, 13). Resultant IFN homologs in each species were further used as query entries to inspect other more diversified IFN homologs. sequence alignments were generated using the programs MUSCLE and ClustalW through EMBL-EBI port (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/) and other sequence management was conducted using programs at the Sequence Manipulation Suite (http://www.bioinformatics.org/). porcine IFN stimulated genes (ISGs) into tunable or robust subgroups were referred to human or mouse ISGs. gene-specific primers were designed and validated using porcine gene annotation. PCR conditions were optimized and validated using confirmed IFN plasmids. all experiments using infectious agents were conducted in the laboratories covered by effective licenses and handled according to restrictive regulations specified. procedures for viral infections were conducted in cells as previously described (9, 10, 13) antiviral activity of IFNs was calculated using the Reed\u2013Muench Method to normalize TCID50 and expressed as U/g/ml. one unit (U) is the highest dilution that reduced cell number by 50%. five-hundred cells in 100 L volume were added to each well of a flat-bottom 96-well plate in triplicate. cells were treated with or without IFN peptides at the indicated concentrations (1:10 serially diluted from 2 ng/ml) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 72 h. we have genome-wide examined IFN genes across the genome sequences of nearly 120 representative species of vertebrates. we identified the emergence and expansion of intronless IFNs in amphibians (10\u201312) in two Xenopus genomes, 13\u201316 intron-containing IFN genes (of both type I and type III IFNs) exist that retain intron-containing gene structure as fish IFN genes, and 24\u201337 intronless IFN genes. genome-wide definition of IFN genes in vertebrate species determined previously unknown molecular complexity of IFN expansion in Amphibian (10), Chiroptera, Rodent (except the two moles) and domestic ungulate species especially pigs and cattle (2, 8\u201310) this revises the linear-increasing pattern of IFN molecular evolution as previously proposed along amniotic evolution (12). in mammals, intronless type I IFNs have evolved through a subtype expansion resulting in at least nine subtypes. subtypes include IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- commonly found in most mammalian species. pigs (and cattle) have the largest expansion of type I IFNs (7\u20139) cross-species examination of IFN- genes indicated that single IFN-like genes are identified in reptiles and birds. multi-gene IFN- subtype are present in most ungulate and bat species. the evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method. the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. extensive sequencing of IFN genes isolated from the DNA pool of 400 pig blood samples allowed us to identify 3\u20137 SNP of each IFN- functional gene. the IFN-5 gene having the maximum 7 SNP identified in that DNA pool (14). these several porcine IFN-5 polymorphic isoforms showed dramatic activity differences (Figure 3), which only differ from each other by few residues. IFN- molecules from one species are phylogenically closer to the orthologs from other species of the same Family/Genus than those from the same species. phylogenic analysis indicated that IFN- molecules from individual Order or Genus might share one common progenitor. IFN- molecules from individual Order or Genus may share a common progenitor. it was also common to observe that IFN- molecule from a species is phylogenically closer to the orthologs from other species of the same Family/Genus than those from the same species. innate immune IFN expression is not restricted to antiviral responses but is extensively involved in immune homeostatic regulation in epithelial mucosa. innate immune IFN expression is not restricted to antiviral responses but is extensively involved in immune homeostatic regulation in epithelial mucosa. n = 3 PCR repeats of tissue samples from 3 to 5 pigs. sub-optimal stimulation of porcine type I IFNs in PRRSV-exposed fetal lungs and alveolar macrophages. incubation of IFN peptides in acidic buffer caused almost no loss in antiviral activity against PRRSV infection. high temperatures at 42, 56, or 63\u00b0C for 5 h removed all activity of the IFN- peptide. however, IFN-5 retained much activity even when treated at 56 or 63\u00b0C for 5 h. porcine IFN-1 and -5 showed higher anti-proliferative activity in porcine monocytes. compared with classical IFN-1 and IFN-, porcine IFN-1 and -5 showed higher anti-proliferative activity in porcine monocytes. induction of IFN stimulated genes confer antiviral and immunomodulatory roles. most robust ISGs are involved in antiviral responses. tunable ISGs are more broadly modulatory for immune and developmental regulation. IFN-s, particularly IFN-5, exerted higher activity in stimulation of IRF7 and Mx1 expression, but are similar to IFN-1 for the effect on IRF3 promoter. porcine IFN-subtypes, especially the highly antiviral IFN-5, potentially signal ISG expression to exert antiviral immunity differently from the classical IFN-1 and IFN- subtypes in both porcine and human cells. n = 3 replicates of 2\u20133 independent assays, a, b, and c: p 0.001, 0.01, and 0.05, respectively, compared to control. data are means SE; n = 3; *p 0.05 relative to the control. porcine IFN-1, IFN-1, and IFN-5 exerted the highest antiviral activity. other subtypes, including IFN-2, exerted the highest antiviral activity. concentrations of IFN-peptides were subjected to gel electrophoresis. bands of most IFN-/ subtypes, IFN-1, and IFN-5 are smeared. signal peptides of swine and bovine IFN peptides were examined using prediSi. this indicates that these \u201coutliers\u201d may represent a group of IFNs that mediate IFN responses via a newly identified intracellular pathway (10, 37), or a non-canonical IFN signaling pathway to mediate some unknown functions (10, 37\u201339). genome-wide examined IFN genes across the genome sequences of nearly 120 representative species of vertebrates. we identified the emergence and expansion of intronless IFNs in amphibians (10\u201312) in two Xenopus genomes, 13\u201316 intron-containing IFN genes (of both type I and type III IFNs) exist that retain intron-containing gene structure as fish IFN genes, and 24\u201337 intronless IFN genes. cross-species and genome-wide definition of IFN genes in vertebrate species determined previously unknown molecular complexity of IFN expansion in Amphibian (10), Chiroptera, Rodent (except the two moles) and domestic ungulate species especially pigs and cattle (2, 8\u201310) this revises the linear-increasing pattern of IFN molecular evolution. in mammals, intronless type I IFNs have evolved through a subtype expansion resulting in at least nine subtypes. subtypes including IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- have further diversified into multi-gene sub-clusters (7\u20139, 27) pigs (and cattle) have the largest expansion of type I IFNs (7\u20139). cross-species examination of IFN- genes indicated single IFN-like genes are identified in reptiles and birds. multi-gene IFN- subtype are present in most ungulate and bat species. porcine IFN- isoforms are orthologous to most, if not all, IFN- gene products identified in mammalian species. the evolutionary history was inferred using the bootstrap method. the tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. extensive sequencing of IFN genes isolated from the DNA pool of 400 pig blood samples allowed us to identify 3\u20137 SNP of each IFN- functional gene. several porcine IFN-5 polymorphic isoforms showed dramatic activity differences. plots among protein sequences of all identified IFN- orthologs across genome sequences of about 60 representative vertebrate species. we detected segregation of IFN- subtype in birds, but the definitive formation of multi-gene IFN- was detected in the genomes of mammals from all Orders except Monotremes. IFN- peptides from animals of different Genus/Family contain IFN- peptides from different Genus/Family, such as the ungulate-mix (Alpaca, Camel, and Bioson) and the RBH-mix (Rhino, Bat, and horse) clusters. innate immune IFN expression is not restricted to antiviral responses but is extensively involved in immune homeostatic regulation in epithelial mucosa. basal expression of IFN genes was normalized against Ct values of a housekeeping gene. n = 3 PCR repeats of tissue samples from 3 to 5 pigs. sub-optimal stimulation of porcine type I IFNs in PRRSV-exposed lungs and alveolar macrophages. incubation of IFN- and IFN- peptides in acidic buffer caused almost no loss in antiviral activity against PRRSV infection in MARC-145 cells. high temperatures at 42, 56, or 63\u00b0C for 5 h removed all activity of the IFN- peptide; however, IFN- peptides showed better thermal stability. porcine IFN-1 and -5 showed higher antiproliferative activity in porcine monocytes. compared with classical IFN-1 and IFN-, porcine IFN-1 and -5 showed higher antiproliferative activity in porcine monocytes. induction of IFN stimulated genes confer antiviral and immunomodulatory roles. tunable ISGs are more broadly modulatory for immune and developmental regulation (35, 36) interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) 3, IRF7 and myxovirus resistance protein 1 (Mx1) genes are other representative ISGs that play key roles in IFN auto-regulation. interferon-regulatory factor (IRF) 3, IRF7 and Mx1 genes are other representative ISGs that play key roles in IFN auto-regulation. t values of the genes were normalized against Ct values of a housekeeping gene (beta-actin) amplified from the same RNA samples to obtain 2Ct. data are means SE; n = 3 replicates of 2\u20133 independent assays. in porcine and monkey cells, most IFN- peptides showed high antiviral activity on average (9, 13) Interestingly, most IFN- peptides exert broad antiviral activity. other subtypes, including IFN- and most IFN- induced much lower antiviral activity (9, 13) IFN peptides were collected and partially purified using centricon\u00ae centrifugal filters. bands of most IFN-/ subtypes, IFN-1, and IFN-5 are smeared. porcine IFN-1, -2, and -2, as well as bovine IFN-4 (Bb), -6 (Bt), -14 (Bb), -22 (Bt) show less sequence identity (80%) overall to other members of the same IFN subtypes. we also detected that these \u201coutliers\u201d of the unconventional IFN subtypes generally do not contain signal peptides for extracellular secretion of the mature IFN peptides. intronless type I IFNs in amphibians were ascribed to cope with dramatic environmental changes during terrestrial adaption (10, 12), we interpret that most species-dependent evolution surges or retreats in IFN gene numbers are related to increased or decreased chances in pathogenic exposure (particularly intracellular ones like viruses) in their ambient habitat. amphibians like Xenopus have diversified 20\u201330 of intronless IFN molecules. these amphibian IFNs seem to have evolved independently and share little molecular phylogeny (45%) to IFN subtypes in mammals (2, 10, 12) we have identified many polymorphic isoforms across the porcine type I IFN gene family (14, 29) the polymorphism (IFN-5-2, Figure 3) has much higher antiviral activity broadly in all our analyses including seven different virus-cell systems (14, 19) both species-specific and cross-species IFN activity are two sides of the same coin. phylogenic and cluster analyses of cross-species IFN- molecules at protein levels imply that mammalian IFN- subtype was diverted from a common IFN ancestor gene during the evolution of reptiles or birds (2). expression patterns of porcine IFN- genes liken to unconventional IFN subtypes such as IFN-//. however, the porcine IFN- genes showed their own pattern of induced expression during viral infection. the current data imply the necessity for gene-specific (at least subtype-specific) expression and activity analysis for IFN- subtype. induction of ISGs with IFN-/, we detected the expression of six ISGs representing both robust antiviral genes and tunable immunomodulatory genes across porcine, human, monkey and mouse cells. we hypothesize that this differential activity in induction of ISGs contributes to the superior antiviral activity of the IFN-5 peptide. however, which ISGs play a critical role will require future mechanistic studies using the knock-out/-in models (35, 41 recent studies of the multi-functional property of unconventional IFNs also propose that IFNs can mediate immune or other physiological responses via non-canonical signaling pathways. this includes that by intracellular IFN-signaling independent of membrane-bound IFNAR and through MAPK- and PI3K-mediated pathways independent to STAT transcription factors. the discovery of their differential biological responses in antiviral, anti-proliferation, and ISG induction imply this possibility. several well-studied subtypes and calls for mechanistic studies of the non-canonical IFN signaling pathways (4, 37\u201341) data Availability The datasets generated for this study can be found in NIH Short Read Archive linked to a BioProject with an accession number of SRP033717.
