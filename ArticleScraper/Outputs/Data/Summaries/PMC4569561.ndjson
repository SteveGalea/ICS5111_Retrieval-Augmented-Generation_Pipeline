{"summary": "influenza A(H7N9) virus has caused two major epidemics of human infections since emerging in early 2013. the first epidemic occurred in the spring of 2013 in eastern china [1, 2], while the second epidemic occurred over the winter of 2013\u201314 in eastern and southern China. more than 80% of confirmed H7N9 cases reported exposure to live poultry or a live poultry market prior to symptom onset. the virus has low pathogenicity in poultry, unlike highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) virus. it is challenging to control the transmission of H7N9 from poultry to humans. permanent closure of LPMs has been proposed in some of the cities affected by H7N9. izability of the study, we used mobile phone surveys in Guangzhou and door-to-door surveys in zijin. we investigated human exposure to live poultry or LPMs, risk perception, psychological and behavioral responses to the outbreak, and attitudes towards control interventions on the H7N9 epidemic. demographic characteristics were analyzed for each survey and compared with chi-squared tests. population levels of anxiety, exposure to live poultry or LPMs, perceived risk of infection with H7N9, behavioral responses to H7N9, and attitudes towards LPM closure were compared. urban respondents in the first survey reported purchasing an average of 36.5 live poultry in the past year. respondents in the second survey reported an average of 26.7 live poultry purchased in the past year. the proportion of respondents who would always touch live poultry declined considerably from 50.2% in the first survey to 20.6% in the second survey. survey 1 (N = 500), n (%) Survey 2 (N = 549), n (%) p value Survey 1 (N = 308), n (%) Survey 2 (N = 300), n (%) p value Mean STAI scores 1.8 2.0 0.01 1.9 1.7 0.01 Worry about H7N9 1 3.8 4.8 0.01 4.2 5.7 0.01 Perceived absolutesusceptibility 2 0.07 0.01 High 9 (2.6) 23 (4.3) 1 (0.3 116 (37.6) Relative severity of H7N9 6 Compared to seasonal flu 319 (65.6) 304 (51.9) 0.01 181 (56.8) 204 (71.9) 0.02 Compared to H5N1 avian flu 163 (32.5) 237 (42.5) 0.01 112 (34.1) 163 (60.2) 0.01 63 (19.4) 34 (10.8) 0.01 Knowledge towards H7N9 transmission Contact poultry in LPMs 404 (80.8) 382 ( subjects who answered worried about it all the time/worried a lot/worried a bit to the question \"Did you worry about H7N9 in the past week\" were categorized as \"Less\" in the table. frquency of LPM visits Relative risk (95% CI) Touching poultry during purchase Odds ratio (95% CI) Support closure of LPMs Odds ratio (95% CI) Change purchase behavior Odds ratio (95% CI) Change purchase behavior Odds ratio (95% CI) Survey 1 Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference Survey 2 -22.5 (-34.2, -10.8) -12.2 (-22.3, -2.1) 0.3 (0.2, 0.6) 1.0 (0.7, ary or above 1.2 (-21.6, 24.1) -25.6 (-47.3, -3.9) 0.7 (0.3, 1.9) 1.8 (0.8, 4.3) 1.5 (0.6, 3.4) Anxiety level (STAI Score) 1st tertile Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference 2nd tertile -0.7 (-13.2, 11.7) -9.3 (-20.2, 1.7) 0.9 (0.5, 1.5) 1.2 (0.8, 1.8) 1.2 (0.8, seasonal influenza Low Reference Reference Reference Reference Reference High 1.1 (-10.3, 12.6) -5.7 (-15.6, 4.2) 0.9 (0.6, 1.5) 0.9 (0.6, 1.3) 1.6 (1.1, 2.4) Compared with H5N1 influenza Low Reference Reference Reference Reference High 6.4 (-5.5, 18.2) -2.0 (-12.0, 8.1) 1.2 (0.7, 1.9) 1.4 (0.9, 2.0) 1.0 (0.7, 1.5) 0.9 (0.6, 1.3) respondents were more likely to support closure of LPMs if they were female, had greater worry about H7N9, higher perceived susceptibility, greater ILI symptom-induced worry, or lower perceived severity of H7N9 relative to H5N1. the impact of two epidemics caused by H7N9 virus was different in mainland China during spring 2013 and winter 2013\u201314 epidemics. rural subjects were probably aware that most detected H7N9 cases exposed to urban LPMs/live poultry instead of backyard poultry. change in raising backyard poultry in the rural area was different from patterns observed in the urban area on live poultry exposure in both waves. live poultry exposures were common in urban and rural areas of Guangdong province. exposures declined in urban residents during winter 2013\u201314, at least partly due to the H7N9 epidemic. a minority of urban respondents supported permanent LPM closure."}
