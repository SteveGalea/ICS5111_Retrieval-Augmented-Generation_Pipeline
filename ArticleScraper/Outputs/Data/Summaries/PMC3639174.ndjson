{"summary": "triggering sensors activates signaling cascades that lead to the expression of host defense genes necessary to fight off infection. viral IFN antagonists constitute a major class of security proteins [4], [5] viral IFN antagonists can be further distinguished based on their ability to i) inhibit the virus-dependent signaling necessary for the production of IFNs and other cytokines. nsp1, nsp3, nsp7, nsp15, ORF3a, ORF3a, ORF3b, ORF6, M and NP have been identified. nsp1 inhibits host gene expression by decreasing translation efficiency. nsp1 expression inhibits the three virus-dependent signaling pathways. nsp1 decreases the levels of STAT1 phosphorylation. nsp1 coding regions were cloned into pcD\u00dfAF3m1 downstream of a triple flag-tag sequence. all nsp1 coding regions were cloned into pcD\u00dfAF3m1 downstream of a N-terminal triple flag-tag sequence. all proteins were expressed from the Cytomegalovirus enhancer. transfection efficiency is routinely >95% as determined by in situ lacZ staining or eGFP expression. luciferase activity is expressed as relative light units (RLU) all extracts for -galactosidase activity were diluted 10-fold. activity is expressed in absorbance units at 405 nm that results from the release of ortho-nitrophenol from ortho-nitrophenyl-galactoside. the quantity of IRF3 dimer was divided by the quantity of IRF3 monomer plus the dimer for each time point. all experiments and measurements are replicated a minimum of three times. the nsp1 coding regions were cloned downstream of a triple flag-tag sequence. all proteins were expressed from the Cytomegalovirus enhancer. transfections consisted of either ISREx3-CAT reporter or pcD\u00dfA-STAT1 or pcD\u00dfA-IRF3. transfection efficiency is routinely >95% as determined by in situ lacZ staining. luciferase activity is expressed as relative light units (RLU) all extracts for -galactosidase activity were diluted 10-fold. activity is expressed in absorbance units at 405 nm that results from the release of ortho-nitrophenol from ortho-nitrophenyl-galactoside. IRF3 dimer was divided by the quantity of IRF3 monomer plus the dimer for each time point. all experiments and measurements are replicated a minimum of three times. if true, the prediction would be that individual residues in nsp1 would differentially affect the ability of nsp1 to inhibit host activities. luciferase, -galactosidase, eGFP, and a reporter plasmid were co-transfected into 293T cells along with plasmids expressing the CAT gene under the control of a virus- and IFN-inducible ISRE, ISREx3-CAT. expression of the reporter is stimulated by both IFN treatment and SeV infection and coexpression of SARS-CoV nsp1-wt luciferase and -galactosidase assays were used as a proxy to measure level of nsp1 inhibition of gene expression. CAT gene under the control of three ISRE copies was used as a proxy for nsp1 inhibition of interferon- and virus-dependent signaling. eight nsp1 variants were generated (nsp1-m1 through nsp1-m8) nsp1 is a small 180-residue protein whose structure has been solved by NMR for residues 13\u2013129. surface residues would be important for interaction between nsp1 and host target protein(s) that would mediate the inhibitory effects of nsp1. -galactosidase activity corresponds to released ortho-nitrophenol absorption at 405 nm using extracts diluted 10-fold. nsp1-m5 exhibited attenuated inhibition of host IFN- and virus-dependent signaling (C); P-values for nsp1-m5 are indicated in figure, significance for other mutants is listed in Table 1. # 111 * 20 *# 17 # 0.66 41 169 30 26 m21 E91R, M92A, D93H, I95A, Q96H i 33 *# 111 * 15 # 19 # 0.57 58 194 26 34 m22 S100R, G101R i 33 *# 205 *# 30 *# 36 * 1.05 31 195 29 35 m37 K141D, S142Q i 110 * 158 *# 93 * 112 * E36K, E37K iii 177 * 66 # 35 *# 35 *# 2.56 69 26 13 14 m16 D33R, E36R, E37R, S40R iii 58 * 61 13 # 17 # 0.92 63 67 14 19 m23 V111D, G112D, T114A iv 80 * 80 324 * 400 * 1.28 63 63 254 314 m24 A117E, # 375 *# 631 *# 1.66 103 122 380 m31 Q63R v 73 * 99 34 * 68 * 0.35 208 284 97 194 m33 Q63R, E65R v 98 * 167 *# 30 *# 44 * 0.48 203 345 61 91 m15 L27D, V28D vi 138 * 94 * 219 * 275 * 2.03 68 46 108 136 m20 nsp1-m14, -m15, -m23 inhibited the virus- and IFN-inducible CAT reporter more strongly than nsp1-wt. mutants nsp1-m16 and nsp1-m17 were not significantly different from nsp1-m5 in their ability to inhibit the CAT reporter stimulation by IFN or SeV. p1-m16 exhibited a complete loss of inhibition of antiviral signaling. mutations introduced in the intrinsically disordered C-terminal segment of nsp1 expressed relatively poorly or barely at all. arginine residues were substituted to test the possibility that the lack of nsp1-m8 expression was due to ubiquitination of those lysines. mutant nsp1-m16 had completely lost its ability to inhibit host IFN- and virus-dependent signaling (A), while retaining wildtype levels of inhibition of -galactosidase expression (C) nsp1-m14 consistently exhibited stronger inhibitory effects than nsp1-wt in all assays. mutants -m35 through -m39 affected residues in the intrinsically disordered C-terminus of nsp1. mutants -m27 through -m30 had a very different phenotype than nsp1-m5 or -m16 from which they were derived. nsp1-m27 and -m30 inhibited the IFN- and virus-inducible CAT reporter and both -galactosi nsp1 mutants have lost the ability to inhibit antiviral signaling. nsp1 mutants were able to isolate a putative set of residues involved solely in the inhibition of host IFN- and virus-dependent signaling. expression of nsp1-m16 resulted in no decrease in either STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF3 dimerization. expression of nsp1-m16 resulted in no decrease in either STAT1 phosphorylation or IRF3 dimerization. nsp1-m14, -m27 and -m30 showed increased inhibition of antiviral signaling. cell extracts were separated by native-PAGE and probed for levels of active phosphorylated STAT1 (P-STAT1) and total STAT1 (STAT1) (A) nsp1-m16 had indeed lost its ability to strongly inhibit both the phosphorylation of STAT1 and the dimerization of IRF3 after cells had been stimulated. luciferase expression was not considered as it was only reduced 1.6-fold by nsp1-wt. group A mutant showed partial attenuation of both gene expression and antiviral signaling. group B mutants had loss most inhibition of both gene expression and antiviral signaling. group C mutants showed differential effects on gene expression and signaling. nsp1-wt exhibits multiple inhibitory effects on host functions. if true, the prediction would be that individual residues in nsp1 would differentially affect the ability of nsp1 to inhibit host activities. if untrue no such mutations would be identified. plasmids expressing luciferase, -galactosidase, eGFP, and a reporter plasmid were co-transfected into 293T cells. luciferase and -galactosidase assays were used as proxy for an nsp1 mutant\u2019s ability to inhibit host gene expression. inhibition of luciferase activity by nsp1-wt is mild (40 nsp1-wt mutants were cotransfected into 293T cells with reporter plasmids. luciferase and -galactosidase assays were used as a proxy to measure level of nsp1 inhibition of gene expression. nsp1-m5 phenotype of partial inhibition of antiviral signaling. nsp1 is a small 180-residue protein whose structure has been solved by NMR for residues 13\u2013129. surface residues would be important for interaction between nsp1 and host target protein(s) that would mediate the inhibitory effects of nsp1. nsp1-m5 exhibited attenuated inhibition of host IFN- and virus-dependent signaling (A) while maintaining wildtype inhibition of -galactosidase (C); P-values for nsp1-m5 are indicated in figure, significance for other mutants is listed in Table 1.

amino acids were color-coded as in (H\u2013J); the boxed sequence correspond to the putative amphipathic -helix displayed in (K). a recent two-hybrid screen identified a large number of host proteins interacting with SARS-CoV a mutant such as nsp1-m16 lacks any ability to inhibit antiviral signaling while maintaining inhibition of gene expression. the levels of nsp1 necessary to inhibit a signaling target will be reached earlier during the replication cycle than those necessary to inhibit translation. a specific inhibition of the IFN genes as opposed to a general inhibition of gene expression is expected to alter the immune response. sp1 inhibitory effects on antiviral signaling and its stimulatory effect on the Calcineurin/NFAT pathway are thought to account at least in part for SARS-CoV morbidity and mortality [42], [43], [45], [36] long-term replication of a virus in a host population may result in evolution towards decreased virulence. several human coronaviruses (HCoVs) have an established niche in humans and cause no or mild disease in healthy adults onism and such mutations may have been part of adaptation to the human population if it not been eradicated by public health measures."}
