{"summary": "4 experimental groups were established to evaluate the hypothesis. the first 2 groups were told they would be observing the anesthesia of rats or mice (rats\u2013anesthetized, mice\u2013euthanized) the second 2 groups were told they would be observing the euthanasia of rats or mice (rats\u2013euthanized, mice\u2013euthanized) mouse colonies were screened quarterly for reovirus 3, Sendai, ectromelia, lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and mouse cytomegalovirus. all mice had previously been used in other noninvasive studies and then transferred to this study for euthanasia. i virus, transmissible murine encephalomyelitis virus, and endoparasites and ectoparasites were euthanized for each of the 4 methods of euthanasia. the induction chamber was a rat cage (43 cm 35.6 cm 22.9 cm; Tecniplast, West Chester, PA) with a volume of approximately 35 L. a series of compact discs were created for the execution of this study. each disc had a single species with recordings of all 4 of the methods of anesthesia (A through D) for both the mice and rats, the recordings for the pentobarbital and 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide were approximately 60 s, as was the recording of the mouse and rat anesthetized with 30%/min VDR carbon dioxide. participants were assigned to either rat or mouse and either anesthesia or euthanasia. at least 5 packets of paperwork and compact discs were prepared in stacks before each session. participants were directed to a dedicated computer where they could observe their assigned videos alone. questions 5 through 15 were repeated for each of the 4 videos that the participants watched. each scoresheet was identified with a code that communicated the species, order in which the videos were watched, and treatment group. the population of people available for this study was anticipated to be small because our laboratory had earlier performed a similar study that enrolled more 1000 people. prior to initiation of the study, we determined that we would set significance at P 0.1000 and ensure that we reported the actual P values. mice were screened quarterly for mouse rotavirus, mouse coronavirus, mycoplasma pulmonis, mouse parvovirus, minute virus of mice, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus 3, sendai virus, transmissible murine encephalomyelitis virus, endoparasites, and ectoparasites. mice were screened quarterly for Clostridium piliforme, ectromelia virus, lymphocytic chor rats were provided rodent chow (LabDiet) and tap water without restriction. temperature and humidity were maintained at 72 \u00b0F (22 \u00b0C) and at least 30%, respectively. mice were screened quarterly for mouse rotavirus, mouse coronavirus, mycoplasma pulmonis, pneumonia virus of mice, rat coronavirus, reovirus 3, rat parvovirus, sendai virus, transmissible murine encephalomyelitis virus, pulmonis, mouse parvovirus, minute virus of mice, pneumonia virus of mice, reovirus 3, sendai virus, transmissible murine encephalomyelitis virus, endoparasites, and ectoparasites. mice were screened quarterly for Clostridium piliforme, ectromelia virus, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, Hantaan virus, mouse adenovirus, and coronavirus, reovirus 3, rat parvovirus, sendai virus, transmissible murine encephalomyelitis virus, and endoparasites and ectoparasites. at the time of this study, the facility was free of all of the listed pathogens. all rats had previously been used in other noninvasive studies and then transferred to this study for euthanasia. a series of compact discs were created for the execution of this study. each disc had a single species with recordings of all 4 of the methods of anesthesia (A through D) for both the mice and rats, the recordings for the pentobarbital and 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide were approximately 60 s. the recordings of the mouse and rat anesthetized with 30%/min VDR carbon dioxide were approximately 4 min. the study was reviewed and approved prior to the initiation of the study. participants were assigned to either rat or mouse and either anesthesia or euthanasia. at least 5 packets of paperwork and compact discs were prepared in stacks. participants were directed to a dedicated computer where they could observe their assigned videos alone. questions 5 through 15 were repeated for each of the 4 videos that the participants watched. each scoresheet was identified with a code that communicated the species, order in which the videos were watched, and treatment group. the population of people available for this study was anticipated to be small because our laboratory had earlier performed a similar study that used a similar format and enrolled more 1000 people. prior to initiation of the study, we determined that we would set significance at P 0.1000. results Mice. the box indicates responses where the participant reported that the animal exhibited no escape behaviors. responses did not differ between the 2 groups for the mice exposed to pentobarbital (X21, 10 = 0.483, P = 0.4870), isoflurane (X21, 10 = 0.000, P = 1.0000), 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X21, 10 = 0.483, P = 0.4870) the group told that the mouse was being anesthetized was significantly more likely to say \u2018yes\u2019 for the mouse representing isoflurane. responses did not differ between groups for the mouse representing pentobarbital (X21, 10 = 5.487, P = 0.0192) for the mouse representing 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X21, 10 = 3.72, P = 0.0702) and the 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X21, 10 = 5.487, P = 0.0702). those who were told they were watching euthanasia were more likely to say \u2018yes\u2019 for the mouse representing 70%. median scores did not differ between groups for pentobarbital (Z = 0.0000, P = 1.000), isoflurane (Z = \u20130.80000, P = 0.4237), 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = 0.0000, P = 1.0000) and 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = \u20131.34164, P = 0.1797) the ranges and medians of scores for each anesthetic are provided in Figure 10. Figure 10. Distribution of scores for escape behavior by number of respondents observing a rat anesthetized with the various anesthetic methods. responses did not differ between groups for pentobarbital (X21, 10 = 1.752, P = 0.1856), isoflurane (X21, 10 = 0.934, P = 0.3338), and 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X2 (1, 10) = 0.760, P = 0.3834) median scores of other distress did not differ between groups for pentobarbital (Z = \u20131.20394, P = 0.2286), isoflurane (Z = \u20130.79715, P = 0.4254), 30% per minute VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = \u20131.05396, P = 0.2919), and 70% per minute VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = 1.53796, P = 0.1241) 0.0000, P = 1.000), isoflurane (Z = \u20130.64774, P = 0.5172), 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = 0.43183, P = 0.6659), and 70% per minute VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = 0.26684, P = 0.7896) the ranges and medians of scores for each anesthetic are provided in Figure 14. Distribution of scores of appropriateness by number of respondents observing a rat anesthetized participants told they were observing euthanasia, 4 who observed mice provided feedback, and only the isoflurane treatment triggered comments. one participant commented on 30% VDR of CO2: 2 indicated that this rat was much more distressed. 2 participants observing mice provided feedback. one indicated that isoflurane took much longer than the other 3 methods. the other indicated that isoflurane took a very long time. the ranges and medians of scores for each anesthetic are provided in Figure 5. Figure 5. Distribution of scores for fear behavior by number of respondents observing a mouse anesthetized with various anesthetic methods. participants who were told that the mouse was being anesthetized were significantly more likely to say \u2018yes\u2019 for the mouse representing isoflurane (X21, 10 = 3.278, P = 0.0702) responses did not differ between groups for the mouse representing pentobarbital. participants were asked whether the mouse exhibited other distress during the induction, responses did not differ between the group told they were observing anesthesia as compared with those told they were observing euthanasia for the mouse representing isoflurane. those who were told the mouse was being anesthetized were more likely to say \u2018yes\u2019 for the mouse representing 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X21, 10 = 3.72, P = 0.0702) but more likely to say \u2018no\u2019 for mice representing pentobarbital (X21, 10 = 0.00000, P = 1.0000), isoflurane (X21, 10 = 1.498, P = 0.2210) and 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X21, 10 = 0.0000, P = 1.0000), and 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X21, 10 = 0.00000, P = 1.0000) median scores of the rankings of escape behavior did not differ between groups for pentobarbital (Z = 0.14699, P = 0.8831), isoflurane (Z = \u20130.60830, P = 0.5430), 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = \u20131.45302, P = 0.1462) and 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = \u20131.15154, P = 0.2495). rat representing pentobarbital (X21, 10 = 1.752, P = 0.1856), isoflurane (X21, 10 = 0.934, P = 0.3338), and 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X2 (1, 10) = 0.760, P = 0.3834) pentobarbital (X21, 10 = 1.185, P = 0.2764), isoflurane (X21, 10 = 0.393, P = 0.5308), 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X21, 10 = 2.486, P = 0.1149) and 70%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (X21, 10 = 0.760, P = 0.3834). median scores did not differ between groups for the rats representing pentobarbital (Z = 0.0000, P = 1.000), isoflurane (Z = \u20130.64774, P = 0.5172), 30%/min VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = 0.43183, P = 0.6659), and 70% per minute VDR of carbon dioxide (Z = 0.26684, P = 0.7896). 4 (11%) 4 (11%) 8 (11%) Bachelor degree (BA, BS) 16 (46%) 11 (29%) 27 (37%) Master degree (MA, MBA, MS) 3 (9%) 2 (5%) 5 (7%) Doctoral degree (PhD, DVM, VMD, MD) 9 (26%) 17 (45%) 26 (36%) Which best describes your position\" one participant commented on 70%/min VDR of CO2, indicating it was rapid and appeared to be good for the rat. the third participant indicated that although the procedure took a long time, the rat did not seem overly distressed. the scientific community continues to pursue studies that evaluate the distress experienced by the animal during euthanasia. the majority of the participants were young, with at least an Associate's degree level of education. most of the participants were female, and more than half were actively engaged in research. the findings suggest that a perception bias was present in the persons sampled. each rat and mouse likely experienced some distress with the procedure. the study assessed their interpretation of these signs rather than the actual wellbeing of the rodents being euthanized."}
