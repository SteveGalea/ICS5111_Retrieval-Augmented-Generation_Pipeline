{"summary": "multiSite GatewayTM system allows combining multiple genetic fragments in one single reaction. this technology has not been accessible in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. this technology allows combining multiple genetic fragments in one reaction. multisite GatewayTM uses modified recombination sites to allow the combination of multiple DNA segments in one single in vitro recombination reaction. the segments are joined in a pDEST in a predefined order and orientation, maintaining the reading frame and with low risk for mutations. existing pENTR collections include ORFeomes from multiple prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Schematic overview of (MultiSite) GatewayTM cloning and properties of the constructed destination vectors. GOI, POI and TOI indicate gene, promoter and tag of interest. CmR, AmpR and KmR indicate chloramphenicol, ampicillin and kanamycin resistance. multiple-fragment multisite gatewayTM vectors have been described. the vector set features the four most commonly used auxotrophic markers for selection of yeast transformants. the presence of the CYC1 terminator in these vectors allows construction of any promoter::ORF:tag combination. pAG vectors contain ampicillin resistance gene for selection in E. coli. the pAG vectors contain an ampicillin resistance gene for selection in E. coli. the pAG vectors contain an ampicillin resistance gene for selection in E. coli.

Tagged plant proteins were expressed in yeast under the control of the constitutive GPD or ADH1 promoters. some ORFeome collections contain entry clones with and without stop codon. other ORFeomes in which the GOI is cloned without a start and without a stop codon are not compatible with our current promoters. the value of the vector set was exemplified by a yeast three-hybrid experiment. we investigated the formation of the ternary protein complex by the Arabidopsis JAZ3, NINJA, and TPL proteins. we have proposed that the adaptor protein NINJA bridges the JAZ proteins to TPL proteins and thereby forms a repressor complex. pGBKT7 (Clontech) are designed so that the bait and prey fusion proteins are targeted to the same subcellular compartment (i.e. nucleus) and are equipped with an epitope tag, HA and c-myc, respectively, allowing easy confirmation of expression through immunoblot. we used the multisite GatewayTM vector pMG426 (Table 1) that carries the URA3 auxotrophic marker that is often still available in yeast strains used for s contain an ampicillin resistance gene for selection in E. coli, one of four different auxotrophic selection markers (HIS3, LEU2, TRP1, and URA3). we did not succeed in creating the Integrating vector with the HIS3 autotrophic marker (Table 1). we cloned two constitutively active promoters (pGPD/TDH3 and pADH1) and a galactose-inducible promoter (pGAL1) into pDONR P4-P1R (Invitrogen) the inducibility of the promoter was verified by expression in yeast of a heterologous Arabidopsis gene fused to a NLS-FLAG-HIS tag using the pMG416 vector transformed yeasts were spotted in 10-fold and 100-fold dilutions on control medium and selective medium (4: SD-Leu-Trp-Ura) gene constructs in pGBKT7 and pGADT7 vectors carry the DNA-binding domain or the transcription activation domain. total protein extracts were obtained and the expressed proteins were visualized through immunoblot analysis. the (NLS)FLAG-HIS tag is particularly suitable when protein purification under denaturing conditions is needed. entry vectors containing the GOI should be cloned with a start codon and without a stop codon. other ORFeomes in which the GOI is cloned without a start and without a stop codon are not compatible with our current promoters. the compatibility of available pENTR collections should always be corroborated either in silico before assembling the different sequences into expression vectors or through epitope tag detection in immunoblots. the N-terminal domain of TPL contains the LisE and CTHL domains and was previously shown to be essential for binding the EAR motif in Aux/IAA proteins [37]. therefore we cloned this part (denominated TPL-N) as a bait protein for Y2H. commonly used Y2H vectors such as pGADT7 and pGBKT7 (Clontech) are designed so that the bait and prey fusion proteins multiSite gatewayTM cloning of multiple genetic segments in one single reaction is accessible in one of the most widely used experimental models in molecular biology. cloning of two constitutive and one inducible yeast promoter in appropriate pENTR vectors and constructed three novel epitope tags, each including a NLS. multiSite GatewayTM cloning was carried out according to manufacturer's guidelines. BP reactions were performed in a total volume of 5 l containing 1 l enzyme. attB2R-attB3 sites were designed to clone the ORF corresponding to TPL-N with and without STOP codon. the entry vectors were introduced into pDONR P2R-P3 through a BP reaction. the resulting entry vectors were transformed into E. coli and sequence verified. E. coli strains used were either the ccdB resistant strain DB3.1 (Invitrogen) or the ccdB sensitive strain DH5. both were grown at 37\u00b0C in LB broth medium with appropriate antibiotics. multiSite LR reactions were performed in 10 L total volume. PCR products were purified with the GeneJET Gel Extraction kit (Fermentas) BP reactions were performed in a total volume of 5 l containing 1 l enzyme, 300 ng pDONR P4-P1R (Invitrogen) and 30 ng of PCR product. incubation and subsequent treatments were the same as those for MultiSite LR reactions. the entry clones pEN-L4-GPD-R1, pEN-R2-NLS-3xFLAG-6xHis-L3 and pEN-L1-NINJA-L2 were recombined by MultiSite GatewayTM LR reaction with pMG426 as destination vector. the y2H and Y3H were selected on SD-Ura-Trp-Leu."}
