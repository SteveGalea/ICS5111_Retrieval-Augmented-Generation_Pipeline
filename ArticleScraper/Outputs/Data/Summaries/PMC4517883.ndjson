{"summary": "fourteen patients presented with respiratory tract infection symptoms; 12 with abnormal pulmonary function and two with normal pulmonary function. the change in pulmonary function at one year post discharge was not significantly correlated with the severity of H1N1 influenza. 1N1 was performed in 48 of the 102 patients diagnosed with mild influenza A virus subtype H1N1 at the First Hospital, Jilin University, china in 2009. each patient was diagnosed by a physician according to the inclusion criteria of influenza A Virus Subtype H1N1 Diagnosis and Treatment Protocol. sex, disease duration, or degree of pulmonary function excluded. subjects excluded from the study. written informed consent obtained from each subject. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) Numeration data were expressed as the incidence rate, a chi-square test was used, data were expressed as mean standard deviation. subjects A one-year pulmonary function follow up of was performed in 48 (48%, 26 men and 22 women) of the 102 patients diagnosed with mild influenza A virus subtype H1N1 at the First Hospital, Jilin University, China in 2009. 45.1%) patients were not re-examined due to practical problems. based on the data from 2009, these 46 patients did not differ from the 48 re-examined patients. patients with chronic respiratory system disease were excluded. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) subjects\u2019 nave pulmonary function tests were normal by routine blood test and physical examination at the one-year follow-up test, chest X-rays showed no significant change. of the 26 patients tested to have abnormal pulmonary function, 12 had respiratory tract infection systems and 14 had decreased ability to perform general physical activities. patients with abnormal pulmonary function had a slightly, but not significant, greater influence on daily activities than normal pulmonary function. no significant differences in pulmonary function and ARDS scores between patients with abnormal pulmonary function and patients with normal pulmonary function. correlation between pulmonary function one year post-hospital discharge and hospitalization indices of patients infected with influenza A virus subtype H1N1. study to assess long term effects of mild influenza A virus subtype H1N1. half of patients recovering from H1N1 influenza had abnormal pulmonary function. one third had diffusion dysfunction, a third had small airway obstruction and another third had decreased ventilation function."}
