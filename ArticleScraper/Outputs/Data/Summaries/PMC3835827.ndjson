{"summary": "132 laboratory-confirmed cases of human infection with avian influenza A (H7N9) virus have been reported, 37 of whom have died. the novel virus infection is associated with severe clinical symptoms characterized by rapidly progressive pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiorgan failure. sporadic human infections with H7N9 virus to date raise more important questions that whether this virus will persistently evolve for better adaption to humans. real-time RT-PCR has become the most popular molecular diagnostic approach in clinical laboratories owing to its simplicity, high sensitivity and specificity. real-time RT-PCR assays are usually carried out with the use of hydrolysis probe (Taqman) or SYBR green fluorescence dye. a total of 7 clinical samples (5 throat-swabs, 1 sputum and 1 tracheal aspirate) from H7N9-infected patients were collected and stored at 70\u00b0C until further analysis. a H7N9 virus isolate (A/Nanjing/1/2013) was used as the reference virus. a base close to the 3\u2032 end of each primer would be substituted by a mixed base to ensure full complementation of several bases close to the 3\u2032 end of each primer with the templates as possible. the number of mixed base sites within each primer was not allowed more than three positions as a general rule. real time quantitative RT-PCR assays were performed using superscript III Platinum SYBR Green One-Step qRT-PCR kit. the amplified HA and NA gene segments were then in-vitro transcribed with T7 RNA polymerase (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) the synthesized RNA transcripts were purified, quantified and mixed with equal-molar amounts. a total of 7 clinical samples (5 throat-swabs, 1 sputum and 1 tracheal aspirate) from H7N9-infected patients were collected and stored at 70\u00b0C until further analysis. RNA Extraction Viral RNA was extracted from 200 l of cell culture supernatants or respiratory specimens using QIAsymphony Virus/Bacteria Mini Kit. based on the first three genomic sequences of the emerging H7N9 virus (A/Anhui/1/2013, A/Shanghai/1/2013 and A/Shanghai/2/2013) deposited in the GISAID EpiFlu database, using the software Primer3 version 4.0. all real time RT-PCR reactions were conducted in triplicate on the ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System. the RT-PCR amplicons were subjected to capillary electrophoresis analysis on the QIAxcel System (Qiagen, Germany) to confirm their specificity. specificity of the assay developed to detect H7N9 virus was evaluated on viral RNA from known genetically and clinically related influenza A viruses including seasonal H1N1 (A/Nanjing/4/2009), H1N1 pdm09 (A/Jiangsu/S61/2009), H3N2 (A/Nanjing/1/2009), H5N1 (A/Jiangsu/1/2007) and H9N2 (A/swine primer sequences were listed in Table 1. primer sequences used for detection of influenza A H7N9 virus. nucleotides identical to those of A/Shanghai/1/2013 are indicated as dots. the RT-PCR amplification segments were then confirmed with a length of 103 bp for H7 and 81.200.17\u00b0C for N9. the detection limit was determined based on serial ten-fold dilutions of in-vitro transcribed viral RNA ranging from 106 to 100 copies. the standard curves of H7 (C) and N9 (F) assays were constructed upon the Ct values against the amount of RNA copy number. amplification signals were obtained in both assays for several known subtypes of human influenza A virus, including seasonal H1N1, H1N1 pdm09, H3N2, H5N1 and H9N2 viruses. real time RT-PCR results showed positive signals were produced in all of the samples for both H7 and N9 examinations. the Ct value obtained from H7 assay was well comparable with that obtained from N9 assay for each individual patient. primer alignments were conducted between primers and 135 H7 and 36 N9 subtype full-length viral gene sequences from NCBI\u2019s influenza virus resource database. nucleotides identical to those of A/Shanghai/1/2013 (H7N9) strain are indicated as dots. Detection limit and standard curve based on serial ten-fold dilutions of in-vitro transcribed viral RNA. the detection limit was determined based on serial ten-fold dilutions of in-vitro transcribed viral RNA ranging from 106 to 101 copies/l. negative amplification signals were obtained in both assays for several known subtypes of human influenza A virus, including seasonal H1N1, H1N1 pdm09, H3N2, H5N1 and H9N2 viruses. there were also no positive amplification signals produced when the assays were applied in the detection of other human respiratory viruses. human infections with influenza A virus are generally confined to 3 HA subtypes (H1, H2 and H3) and 2 NA subtypes (N1 and N2). human infections with influenza A virus are generally confined to 3 HA subtypes (H1, H2 and H3) and 2 NA subtypes (N1 and N2) a rapid molecular diagnostic assay is the top priority in public health laboratories. we developed a green-based real time RT-PCR assay for rapid identification of this novel virus. the assay was found to detect H7 and N9 genes with a detection limit of 10 copies per reaction. the specificity of the assay was established through testing a panel of previously known influenza A virus subtypes. no specific amplification signals were observed in all reactions with the viruses above as the templates. the present SYBR green-based real time RT-PCR assay proved to be a powerful tool for rapid, sensitive and specific detection. it could provide a simple and economic alternative approach for high throughput screening of suspected samples from humans, animals and environments."}
