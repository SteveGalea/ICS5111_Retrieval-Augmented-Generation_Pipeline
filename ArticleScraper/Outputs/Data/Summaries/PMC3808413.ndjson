{"summary": "the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase - protein kinase B - mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-Akt-mTOR) pathway regulates cell growth and proliferation. the deregulation of the pathway underlies oncogenic transformations and its modulation by anti-neoplastic treatments affects their outcome. inhibition of mTOR leads to increased phosphorylation of eIF2. this leads to increased phosphorylation of eIF2 - a subunit of eIF2. in mammalian cells eIF2 is phospho. the catalytic subunit of phospho-protein phosphatase 1 (PP1c) dephosphorylation is conducted in complex with specific regulatory subunits. it interferes with the association of PP1c and its regulatory subunits, leading to increased eIF2 phosphorylation. the molecular outcome and physiological relevance of increased eIF2 phosphorylation has been extensively studied during endoplasmic reticulum. agents such as doxorubicin or histone deacetylase inhibitors also led to increased phosphorylation of eIF2. the drug-induced increase in eIF2 phosphorylation is protective against cell death. but an excessive and sustained eIF2 phosphorylation may be as harmful as its total abrogation. the development of drugs that increase eIF2 phosphorylation may provide additional means for enhancing the sensitivity to established anti-neoplastic therapies. our results suggest that the development of drugs that increase eIF2 phosphorylation may provide additional means for enhancing the sensitivity to established anti-neoplastic therapies and/or circumventing resistance to drugs that target upstream components of the PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway. an experimentally determined surviving fraction that is lower than the calculated one indicates that the two agents have an enhanced rather than an additive inhibitory effect on cell survival. the cellular fraction in percent that does not survive treatment is equal to: [1-surviving fraction] x100 and the theoretical additive inhibitory effect of agents a and b on the size of killed cellular fraction in percent. to BRCA1 (clone D9) and to CD2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. (Dallas, TX) Characterization of epithelial specific antigen (ESA) expression by FACS analysis Control and salubrinal treated cells were detached with non-enzymatic cell dissociation solution (Sigma, Israel) 7-aminoactinomycin D (7AAD, eBiosciences, San Diego, CA) served as viability dye. cells were co-transfected with I-SceI expressing vector and pDsRed2-N1 at a ratio of 10:1. transfection was performed with LT1 DNA transfection reagent (Mirus Bio LLC.) transfection was performed in 10 cm culture dishes. 10 g plasmids were incubated in 6 ml growth medium without antibiotics for 24 hours before adding 0.5 ml medium. expression of reporter protein was monitored in Western blots with anti-CD2. surviving fractions were performed in triplicates as described before [28] unless otherwise noted, colonies were fixed, stained and counted 8-10 days following plating. the theoretical additive effect, of combined anti-neoplastic treatments, on cell-survival was calculated according to the following formula: 100 x SFa x SFb (SFa = surviving fraction of cells treated with agent 'a') radiograms were obtained with Image J NIH software. antibodies that recognize either p-eIF2 or both the phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated eIF2 were from Cell Signaling Technologies (Boston, MA) antibodies to BRCA1 (clone D9) and to CD2 were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc. the cells were a gift from Dr. dahm-Daphi, university of Hamburg and the U2OS were a gift from Dr. Scully, Harvard Medical School [32,34] the assay was performed essentially as described by Moyal et al. and Seluanov et al. [34,35] except that cells were treated with 4.5 M salubrinal 6 hours prior to transfection with plasmids expressing I-SceI (or transfection of cells with plasmids coding for eIF2 variants heIF2 S51A and heIF2 S51D in pcDNA3.CD2 [36,37] were a gift from Dr. Ron's laboratory New York, NY. rapamycin led to increased phosphorylation of eIF2 in both MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells. increased level of p-eIF2 as well as increased ratio of p-eIF2 to eIF2 was sustained through 48 hours post-irradiation. in some experiments a decrease in the total level of eIF2 in irradiated cells was noted. eIF2alpha (e), p-eIF2 (p) and ratio of p-eIF2/eIF2 (p/e) in irradiated cells. analysis for MCF-7 at 24 hours post-irradiation with 1.5 and 9.5 Gy represents 2 and 3 separate determinations respectively and at 48 hours 3 separate determinations for each dose. inal alone suggests that irradiated cells are more susceptible to increased eIF2 phosphorylation than non-irradiated cells. sensitivity to radiation was also noted in salubrinal treated MCF-7 cells. inal on cell death at 9 and 16.5 M was significant (p0.05). eIF2 S51D did not affect survival relative to eIF2 S51A. radiation-induced increase in phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2. phosphomimetic eIF2 variant increases clonogenic death in irradiated cells. phosphomimetic eIF2 variant increases clonogenic death in control and irradiated cells. the experiment was reproduced twice with similar results. differences between control and irradiated groups as well as between the two groups of irradiated variants were significant p0.05. salubrinal increases activity of senescence-associated -Galactosidase. cells were plated for colony survival assay. salubrinal inhibits repair of I-SceI-induced. increased eIF2 phosphorylation in irradiated cells abrogated radiation-induced increase in cellular BRCA1. lower panels: cells transfected with 10 g/ml of the S51A and S51D variants or with transfection reagents alone. combining low concentrations of salubrinal and Vorinostat, at concentrations that individually hardly affect eIF2 phosphorylation, resulted in increased phosphorylation of eIF2. this once again was associated with increased clonogenic death. KU-0063794 is a specific mTOR inhibitor which competes with ATP binding for the catalytic site of the enzyme. it leads to increased eIF2 phosphorylation in rapamycin resistant breast cancer cells. eIF2 is a downstream target of rapamycin and irradiation At nM concentrations rapamycin led to increased phosphorylation of eIF2 which was much more pronounced in MCF-7 than in MDA-MB-231 cells. in some experiments a decrease in the total level of eIF2 in irradiated cells was noted. a. MCF-7 and b. MDA-MB-231 cells were irradiated with the indicated radiation dose and processed for analysis of eIF2 phosphorylation at the noted time post-irradiation. Mean SEM of fold change relative to control of eIF2alpha (e), p-eIF2 (p) and the ratio of p-eIF2/eIF2 (p/e) in irradiated cells. salubrinal and 1.5 Gy, phosphorylation of eIF2 was similar to that obtained in cells treated with salubrinal alone. irradiated cells are more susceptible to increased eIF2 phosphorylation than non-irradiated cells. irradiated cells are more susceptible to increased eIF2 phosphorylation. the effect of salubrinal on cell death at 9 and 16.5 M was significant (p0.05). the effect of salubrinal on cell death at 9 and 16.5 M was significant. radiation-induced increase in phosphorylation of endogenous eIF2 was similar in eIF2 S51A and eIF2 S51D expressing cells. similar to salubrinal the deleterious effect caused by expression of eIF2 S51D results from an increased cellular level of inhibited eIF2 i.e. eIF2 S51D. the experiment was reproduced twice with similar results. differences between control and irradiated groups and between the two groups of irradiated variants were significant p0.05. we counted these cells in colonies formed following exposure to 1 Gy, to 4.5 M salubrinal to the combination of radiation and salubrinal and in untreated controls. however, combined treatment of 4.5 M salubrinal and 1 Gy did not lead to enhanced clonogenic death. plasmids for NHEJ and HRR respectively showed that salubrinal inhibited repair of I-SceI-induced DSB via both mechanisms. increased eIF2 phosphorylation in irradiated cells abrogated radiation-induced increase in cellular BRCA1. combining low concentrations of salubrinal and Vorinostat at concentrations that individually hardly affect eIF2 phosphorylation resulted in increased phosphorylation of eIF2. this once again was associated with increased clonogenic death. mTOR catalytic inhibitor KU-0063794 leads to increased eIF2 phosphorylation in rapamycin resistant breast cancer cells. it competes with ATP binding for the catalytic site of the enzyme. increased concentrations of Ku-0063794 (Ku) were treated with increasing concentrations of Ku-0063794 (Ku) differences between all experimental groups as well as between each experimental group and control were significant p0.05. inhibition of mTOR does not affect phosphorylation of eIF2 [12,16]. it remains to be determined if the phenomenon we demonstrated in our study e.g. increased eIF2 phosphorylation following inhibition of mTOR by rapalogues or by Ku-0063794. excessive and sustained phosphorylation of eIF2 may aggravate cell damage by interfering with activation of stress response and consequently with fatty acid oxidation. decreased survival of these cells is taken as a proof for the protective role played by eIF2 phosphorylation. however, this interpretation does not take into account the possibility mentioned above that a regulated phosphorylation may be protective. eIF2 phosphorylation leads to proteasomal degradation of cyclin D1. radiation increased ER stress leading to activation of PERK. it remains to be determined if radiation and rapamycin inactivate mTORC1 functions.
