{"summary": "a meta-analysis from 2013 showed that this group were actually at lower risk of death and hospitalisation, but higher risk of developing pneumonia [2]. indigenous ethnicity has been described as a risk factor with an elevated mortality rate or hospitalisation rate compared to European descendants in a study conducted in Canada [12], [13], [14], [15], [16]. in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, overall, more women than men were hospitalised. this may be indicative of the fact that women generally mount higher immune responses to viruses compared to men. however, it is more likely a result of immunocompromise during pregnancy. in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, overall, more women than men were hospitalised. this may be due to the fact that women generally mount higher immune responses to viruses compared to men [18], but it is more likely a result of immunocompromise during pregnancy, as many of the hospitalised female patients were pregnant [22]. feron Regulatory Factor 7 (IRF7) gene showed a severely impaired antiviral response with reduced expression of type I and III interferons. anti-viral factor MXA (Mx1 in mice) also shows some natural genetic variance. it has been shown that MXA restricts influenza A virus infection in a strain-specific manner. this interaction may be more dependent on viral variance rather than host genetics. SNPs in antimicrobial genes Surfactant Protein A2 (SFTPA2) and Galectin-1 have been implicated as risk factors for severe influenza infection. these proteins are found in the airways, and can directly interact with influenza virus, limiting its replication. a genome wide association study found only one risk variant. IFITM3 has been shown to restrict cytomegalovirus [53] and Sendai virus [54] through restriction of cytokine production, mechanisms independent of direct viral restriction. this is interesting due to the finding that hypercytokinemia in influenza infection can lead to more rapid progression of disease in both humans [55] and mice [42]. IFITM3 rs12252 is a synonymous SNP within the first exon of IFITM3. it has been associated with increased severity in influenza infection, as well as faster progression to AIDS with HIV-1 infection. this SNP is common in Asian populations (MAF = 0.528) but rare in European populations (MAF = 0.041) model experiments using 21-IFITM3 showed that this truncated version of the protein was mostly translocated to the plasma membrane. it did not restrict viral infection by influenza or HIV-1 as well as its full length counterpart. this suggests that a truncated version of the protein is unlikely to lead to the differences in viral restriction previously seen. a more recent study suggests that IFITM3 only functions to block release of viral particles post-hemifusion but prior to pore formation. the mechanism by which it achieves this is still unclear. IFITM3 protein characteristics IFITM3 is one of five IFITM genes found in humans. the exact topology of IFITM3 is unknown due to its highly hydrophobic nature. there are three models currently considered: an intramembrane helix with a C-terminal transmembrane helix and an intramembrane protein with both termini cytoplasmic. poly-ubiquitination on lysine amino acids led to a reduction in antiviral activity of IFITM3, most likely due to an increase in protein degradation. the phosphorylation of the tyrosine at position 20 of IFITM3 (Y20) was described as necessary for the co-localisation of IFITM3 with late endosomes and lysosomes. IFITM2/3 co-localised with the late endosomal marker Rab7 and the lysosomal markers LAMP1, LAMP2 and CD63 [50], [67], [85]. Using a haemagglutinin tag (HA) to IFITM3, yount et al showed co-localisation with the endoplasmic reticulum (Calreticulin) and early endosomes (Rab5) [78]. in mice, constitutive expression of IFITM3 has been demonstrated in the lung upper and lower airways, visceral pleura and tissue-resident leukocytes. for humans, the protein atlas database shows data suggesting that both protein and RNA levels of IFITM3 are variable across cell types. the effect of Type III IFN stimulation has not been widely studied. one mouse study stated that type III IFN did not induce IFITM3 expression while types I and II did. the differential response of the IFITM3 gene to IFN stimulation may be a reflection of differences in IFN receptor expression on these cells. the distribution of the major (G) and minor (A) alleles of IFITM3 rs34481144 is shown according to their distribution worldwide. the distribution of the major (T) and minor (C) alleles of IFITM3 rs34481144 is shown according to their distribution worldwide. lack of association is likely due to the very low number of rs12252-CC patients included and the fact that most patients were from Caucasian, European populations. a recent meta-analysis confirmed the association between rs12252-CC and influenza severity [63]. a more recent study suggests that IFITM3 only functions to block release of viral particles post-hemifusion but prior to pore formation. the mechanism by which it achieves this is still unclear. IFITM3 protein characteristics IFITM3 structure IFITM3 is one of five IFITM genes found in humans. the exact topology of IFITM3 is unknown due to its highly hydrophobic nature. the hydrophobic region of IFITM3 adopts a topology containing two short intramembrane -helices followed by a long transmembrane -helix [81]. poly-ubiquitination on lysine amino acids led to a reduction in antiviral activity of IFITM3. the phosphorylation of the tyrosine at position 20 of IFITM3 (Y20) was described as necessary for the co-localisation of IFITM3 with late endosomes and lysosomes and its antiviral function [64], [67], [85]. IFITM3 co-localised with the late endosomal marker Rab7 and the lysosomal markers LAMP1, LAMP2 and CD63 [50], [67], [85]. mice embryonic fibroblasts also exhibited co-localisation between IFITM3 and LAMP1 [82]. in differentiated cells expression of ISGs such as IFITM3 is low or non-existent constitutively but strongly induced by IFN stimulation. in mice, constitutive expression of IFITM3 has been demonstrated in the lung upper and lower airways, visceral pleura and tissue-resident leukocytes. IFITM3 is induced by cytokines such as IL-6 [87] but predominantly by interferons through the two IFN stimulated response elements (ISRE) and one gamma-interferon activation site (GAS) directly upstream of the promoter and enhancer regions. the effect of type III IFN stimulation has not been widely studied. the exact topology of IFITM3 is unknown due to its highly hydrophobic nature. the hydrophobic region of IFITM3 adopts a topology containing two short intramembrane -helices followed by a long transmembrane -helix [81]. these short helices are predicted to induce membrane curvature. poly-ubiquitination on lysine amino acids led to a reduction in antiviral activity of IFITM3. the phosphorylation of the tyrosine at position 20 of IFITM3 (Y20) was described as necessary for the co-localisation of IFITM3 with late endosomes and lysosomes and its antiviral function [64], [67], [85].
