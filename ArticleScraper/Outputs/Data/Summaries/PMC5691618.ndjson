{"summary": "mammalian orthoreovirus is widely studied as an anti-cancer agent. it has the natural preference to replicate in and lyze tumor cells. an antiviral response in normal cells hinders virus replication and cytolysis. reovirus induces the full autophagic flux in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. reovirus induces the full autophagic flux in immortalized mouse embryonic fibroblasts. a productive reovirus infection facilitates autophagy. Buffers Rapamycin (Rapa) and Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) stock solutions were stored at 20 \u00b0C. atg3 and Atg5 genes were reintroduced in the immortalized knock-out MEFs by lentiviral or retroviral transductions. all MEFs were cultured in DMEM plus pen-strep and 10% FBS. a concentration of 5.95 109 pfu/mL in MEM supplemented with pen-strep. UV inactivation was achieved by exposure to shortwave UV light for 15 min. absence of infectious virus was confirmed by plaque assay on 911 cells. primary 4F2 mouse anti-reovirus 3 was obtained from the developmental studies Hybridoma Bank. eGFP-LC3 fusion orf from plasmid Addgene #11546 was cloned downstream of the internal CMV promoter of plasmid pLV-CMV-IRES Puro expressing a puromycin-resistance cassette. the coverslips were incubated in anti-fade reagent (ProLong Gold with DAPI, Cell Signaling Technology, Leiden, The Netherlands) after the antibody stainings, the coverslips were incubated in anti-fade reagent (ProLong Gold with DAPI, Cell Signaling Technology, Leiden, The Netherlands) the next day. Reagents and Buffers Rapamycin (Rapa) and Bafilomycin A1 (BafA1) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA) Stock solutions were stored at 20 \u00b0C. atg3wt, atg3/, and atg3+/+ genes were reintroduced in the immortalized knock-out MEFs by lentiviral or retroviral transductions. all MEFs were cultured in DMEM plus pen-strep and 10% FBS. all experiments were performed with CsCl-purified virus stocks. the absence of infectious virus was confirmed by plaque assay on 911 cells (10 pfu/mL) primary 4F2 mouse anti-reovirus 3 was obtained from the NICHD. eGFP-LC3 fusion orf from plasmid Addgene #11546 was cloned downstream of the internal CMV promoter of plasmid pLV-CMV-IRES Puro expressing a puromycin-resistance cassette. a647-coupled anti-mouse antibody was used as a secondary antibody. the coverslips were incubated in anti-fade reagent (ProLong Gold with DAPI, Cell Signaling Technology, Leiden, The Netherlands) and imaged the next day using a leica DM6B fluorescence microscope and home-made ColourProc software. microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is recruited to autophagosomal membranes. to determine whether reovirus induces autophagy, the localization of LC3 was examined. mouse embryonic fibroblasts were transduced with the GFP-LC3 lentivirus and infected with jin-3 reovirus. reovirus infection triggers microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) puncta in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) reovirus infection triggers microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) puncta in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. reovirus infection induces atg5-Atg12 conjugation, LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, and p62 degradation in MEFs. protein lysates were prepared in Giordano lysis buffer 48 h post infection (hpi) atg3wt, Atg3/, and Atg3+/+ MEFs were infected with R124 or jin-3 at an MOI of 0.1 or 10. after 72 h, protein lysates were prepared in Giordano lysis buffer. total amount of infectious virus particles in the 24-wells plate well was determined by plaque assays. protein lysates were prepared in Giordano lysis buffer and analyzed for the expression of 3, Atg13, and Actin. cells were collected in the supernatant, lyzed by three freeze-thaw cycles, and the total amount of infectious virus particles in the 24-wells plate well was determined by plaque assays. the question remains whether the same holds true for human cell lines. reovirus infection induces autophagy in human glioblastoma cells. reovirus infection induces atg5-Atg12 conjugation, LC3-I to LC3-II conversion, and acidic vesicular organelles in glioblastoma cells. enlarged orange-to-red vesicles were clearly visible in the U87-MG cells. reovirus induces the formation of autophagolysosomes. acidic vesicles were detected in U251-MG upon Rapa treatment. cells were fixed, dehydrated, embedded, and ultrathin cell sections were analysed by electron microscopy. scale bars represent 4.6 m (left panel), or 920 nm (right panel, 5 zoom of left panel cell) AV, autophagic vacuoles; VP, viral particles. the reovirus genome is dispensable for the induction of autophagy. p62 levels were decreased only upon infection with replication-competent R124. a productive R124 infection is not strictly necessary, but a productive R124 infection strongly stimulates the induction of autophagy. reovirus infection triggers microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) puncta in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. jin-3 was obtained through serial passaging of the reovirus on glioblastoma cells that lack the expression of the reovirus receptor junction adhesion molecule A (JAM-A) clei are visible in blue (DAPI), and GFP-LC3 in green. reovirus induces Atg5-Atg12 conjugation, p62 Degradation, and LC3 Lipidation in MEFs Autophagy. jin strain seems to be a more potent inducer of autophagy than R124. the complete autophagic flux is induced by reovirus, p62 expression was determined. a clear decrease in p62 levels could be detected, indicating that the full flux of autophagy was induced. we used SV40 transformed MEF cells with a knock-out for a specific autophagy-related gene: Atg3, Atg5, or Atg13. cells were collected in the supernatant, lyzed by three freeze-thaw cycles. total amount of infectious virus particles in the 24-wells plate well was determined by plaque assays. atg5wt, Atg5/, and Atg5+/+ MEFs were infected with R124 or jin-3 at an MOI of 1. reovirus induces autophagy in human glioblastoma cell lines. glioblastoma cell lines U251-MG and U87-MG were infected with R124 or jin-1. jin-1 was the first mutant reovirus we isolated from reovirus-infected glioblastoma cells. autophagic vacuoles fuse to lysosomes, resulting in the formation of enlarged acidic vesicles. acridine orange was used to study the degree to which acidic vesicles are present in cells upon reovirus infection. autophagosomes can be observed in mock-treated U87-MG cells. cells were infected with R124 or treated with 400 nM Rapa. the results revealed the presence of viral replication factories upon R124 infection. UV-inactivated reovirus particles were exposed to the corresponding replication-competent virus. the absence of infectious virus was confirmed by plaque assay on 911 cells (10 pfu/mL) the MOI of UV-inactivated reovirus particles is based on the infectious titer prior to UV inactivation, and is referred to as MOI*. U87-MG cells were infected with R124 at an MOI of 10, or UV-inactivated R124 particles at an MOI of 10, 200, or 1000. after 48 h, protein lysates were made in RIPA lysis buffer and analyzed for the expression of Atg5, 3, p62, LC3 and Actin. avian reovirus p17 non-structural protein has been shown to trigger autophagy. studies on rotavirus have revealed that its viroporin NSP4 activates autophagy by stimulating the release of calcium from the ER into the cytoplasm. this process relies on the activity of PI3K, Atg3 and Atg5. this process relies on the activity of PI3K, Atg3, and Atg5. no virions were detected inside autophagosomal structures. an increase in LC3-II can also be the result of a delay or a block in autolysosomal degradation. it is crucial to assess whether reovirus induces the full autophagic flux. a subset of autophagy-related proteins seems to facilitate reovirus replication. this raises the question as to whether the formation of LC3-II rather than the process of autophagy facilitates replication of reovirus. reovirus entry relies on the maturation of endosomes, raising the possibility that entry of the virus is hindered in the absence of Atg3 [42,43]. research on non-canonical roles of Atg5 has demonstrated that the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate can alternatively function to inhibit type I IFN production by directly interacting with RIG-I. exposure of cells to a much higher MOI* (200 or 1000) of UV-inactivated virus is able to induce autophagic features. it could be speculated that a specific reovirus capsid protein is involved in the induction of autophagy."}
