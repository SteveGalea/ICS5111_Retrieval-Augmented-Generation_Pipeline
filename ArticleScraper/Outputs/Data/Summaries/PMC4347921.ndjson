{"summary": "the tick surveillance was undertaken at 14 fixed points and in 5 wild boars in Kyoto City from May to September 2011. we chose 14 surveillance points located on the mountainsides of the northern (A to E in Fig. 1A and Table 1), western (F to K) and eastern (L to N) parts of Kyoto City. the vegetation at these locations consisted mostly of short grasses. we then re-constructed the tick population graphs for each geographical area, I, II and III (D). a circle representing a population size of fifty ticks is shown in the box in panel D. icornis 0 0 0 26 26 (71 m) H. flava 0 0 0 47 47 I (Haikata) 31 Aug H. longicornis 0 0 0 166 166 (392 m) H. flava 0 0 0 0 51 51 J (Jyurin-ji) 31 Aug H. longicornis 0 0 0 0 0 (114 m) H. flava 0 one hundred and ninety four ticks (96.5%) were identified as H. longicornis. twenty four, 30 and 140 ticks were male, female and nymph. of these, 21 ticks were captured from 5 wild boars. 30 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 60 sec, annealing at 60\u00b0C for 60 sec and extension at 72\u00b0C for 60 sec were followed. the final extension was performed at 72\u00b0C for 7 min. species No. of ticks examined Total number 24 31 146 201 143 125 a) Number of ticks which were positive in the PCR using at least one primer pair, Rj5 and Rj10. a total of 3,198 ticks belonging to 5 species of 3 genera were collected from 12 of the 14 sampling points in Kyoto City. the dominant species among the ticks collected in this study were H. longicornis and H. flava. almost all the ticks captured were H. longicornis. in the western mountains, H. longicornis and H. flava were the dominant species. in the eastern mountains, A. testudinarium was the second common species after H. longicornis. phylogenetic tree of SFG rickettsiae isolated from ticks in Kyoto, japan derived from sequences of PCR fragments of the 17K antigen gene. the tree was constructed with the neighbor joint method. the tree was constructed with the neighbor joint method. 71.1% of ticks present near the central city of Kyoto were found to be positive for rickettsial DNA by PCR. rickettsial DNA was detected at all the 8 surveillance locations where H. longicornis was collected. rickettsial DNA was detected in 12.6% of ticks using the same primer pairs as used in this study. 62.2% of the ticks appeared to be positive for PCR using Rj5 and Rj10 as the primer set for R. japonica in the present study. the proportion of ticks obtained from wild boars harbored rickettsial DNA (5/21, 23.8%) was less than that of ticks sampled in the plants (138/180, 76.7%). the proportion of ticks obtained from wild boars that harbored rickettsial DNA was less than that of ticks sampled in the plants."}
