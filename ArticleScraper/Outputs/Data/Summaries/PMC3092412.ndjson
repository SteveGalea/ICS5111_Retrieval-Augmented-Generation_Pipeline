{"summary": "two landmark institute of medicine (IOM) reports outlined these vulnerabilities. the first of two IOM reports, released in 1992, highlighted the potential role of doD overseas laboratories in addressing emerging infectious diseases. in 2008, AFHSC-GEIS became a division of the Armed Forces Health Surveillance Center (AFHSC) by direction of the deputy secretary of defense. this move centralized doD-wide healthcare surveillance initiatives with domestic and overseas laboratory surveillance efforts. ninety-two countries were impacted with either active surveillance, capacity-building initiatives or participation in training exercises.

AFHSC-GEIS surveillance provides baseline infectious disease risk data that directly influences priorities and viable geographic locations. the involvement of doD partners throughout the world in this work can clearly be seen as serving a global health diplomacy role. international relations are improved and trust is developed. other doD organizations work in this broad field of health diplomacy, but less directly in active biosurveillance. the center for strategic and international studies commented that with expanding efforts, agencies should leverage existing successful programs. each year, more than 1.6 million people die from diarrheal disease, 800,000 from malaria and 20,000 from dengue fever. emerging infections, whether naturally occurring or the result of human introductions, can result in social unrest and instability on a scale quite out of proportion to the level of risk they introduce. a total of 198 proposals were received and evaluated by an internal review board of AFHSC staff. each proposal was evaluated based on potential to fill a critical gap in public health programs, b) likelihood of tri-service or doD-wide benefits, d) responsiveness to critical operational theater or regional needs, e) quality of epidemiology and science, f) leveraging existing strengths, and g) accessibility of nonfiscal resources needed for execution. GEIS does not archive extensive data sets from partners or host countries. analysis and interpretation is largely done by the partner conducting the work, in collaboration with the host country. the value added to these two organizations by the GEIS network is clear in the examples of the WHO reference laboratory status of Naval Medical Research Unit 3 (NAMRU-3) in Cairo, Egypt, and U.S. Army Medical Research Unit-Kenya (USAMRU-K) both laboratories were highly leveraged in training and laboratory capacity building during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [24]. this global DoD surveillance network should not and does not operate in a vacuum. 71 percent (37 of 52) were identified or confirmed at doD partner laboratories funded by AFHSC-GEIS. detected first four cases of novel A/H1N1 through two partner laboratories. supported diagnostic confirmation of first novel A/H1N1 cases in 14 countries. biosafety-level 3 laboratories were commissioned in 2009 at NHRC in San Diego, Calif., and AFRIMS in Bangkok, Thailand. AFRIMS published the first report of clinically significant Plasmodium falciparum malaria resistance to the potent artemisinin antimalarial drug class, spurring WHO, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and host national malaria control officials. the first laboratory-confirmed cases of leptospirosis in the border areas of Thailand and Myanmar were reported by AFRIMS. AFRIMS provided timely outbreak response services to the Nepali National Public Health laboratory. nearly 6,000 cases of multidrug-resistant typhoid fever originating from a single point source were reported. 112 manuscripts associated with projects partly or wholly supported by AFHSC-GEIS were published in 2009. the number of poster sessions and presentations at various public and private conferences was far higher. the number of publications in peer-reviewed journals and presentations was far higher. the new guidelines changed from specific diseases of concern to any event that could be considered a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d the regulations acknowledge and encourage countries and organizations that are able to assist resource-poor countries in their compliance process. the international health regulations (2005), or IHR (2005), were adopted by the WHO 58th World Health Assembly on may 23, 2005. the focus of these new guidelines changed from specific diseases of concern to any event that could be considered a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern\u201d the regulations acknowledge and encourage countries and organizations that are able to assist resource-poor countries in their compliance process. a unique niche that U.S. uniformed officers across the world can and should expand engagement is with their global uniformed counterparts. despite political agendas, remarkable progress in facilitating open lines of communication can occur when two researchers or public health professionals establish mutual rapport for a mutual interest: optimal health of their uniformed service members. surveillance & EID lab capability Peru Electronic disease surveillance EID and influenza laboratory Influenza & EID lab capability capacity & training; disease reporting capability Poland Influenza surveillance & EID lab capability Influenza & EID reporting capability Thailand Unit-based electronic surveillance EID and influenza laboratory Influenza surveillance & disease surveillance Standardization of laboratory procedures (QA/QC) surveillance is an ongoing process, not one that is implemented only in times of public health emergency. the right mix of empowering surveillance activities with capacity building is important to mitigate perceptions of taking but not giving. authors wish to thank individuals who perform global surveillance as part of the AFHSC-GEIS network."}
