{"summary": "the most frequent infectious diseases in humans are usually transmitted via droplets during close proximity interactions. such infectious diseases include influenza, common colds, whooping cough, and many others. it is critical to identify the group of individuals who are in close contact with the diagnosed patient. ity Interaction proposes a novel framework to evaluate the infection risk of identified individuals. our method effectively addresses the problem of infectious disease prevention, greatly reducing labor and time costs. researchers use wearable devices to analyze the contact patterns among a group of individuals. the typical device is RFID-based and proves to be useful in a variety of scenarios. re-identification is a long-standing and significant problem. it aims at re-identifying the person of interest from a collection of images or videos taken by multiple non-overlapping cameras over a prolonged period. two types of solutions are proposed to address these problems. horizontal pyramid matching approach is proposed by Fu et al. (2018). metric learning approaches are exploited such as cross-view quadratic discriminant analysis (Liao et al., 2015), relative distance comparison optimization (PRDC algorithm). single person pose estimation is based on the assumption that the person dominates the image content. the case of a single person in one captured image seldom happens. state-of-the-art approaches built on CNN can be divided into two categories. Cascaded Pyramid Network (CPN) takes two steps to cope with overlapping or obscured keypoints. Faster RCNN (Ren et al., 2015) is the person detector and the fully convolutional ResNet to predict heatmaps and offsets. researchers explored the use of transfer learning to tackle the problem of dynamic multi-objective optimization. this method can significantly speed up the evolutionary process by reusing past experience and generating an effective initial population pool. the method directly applies to real-world scenarios to identify potentially-infected subjects. researchers compared the two methods of reporting with paper diaries and recording with wearable sensors. they found that reporting was notably incomplete for contacts 5 min. participants appear to have overestimated the duration of their contacts. two types of solutions are proposed to address these problems. one is to learn a distinctive feature representation to make a trade-off between recognition accuracy and generalization ability. the other is to leverage the Siamese neural network and triplet loss to minimize the loss of images with the same identity and maximize that with different identities. Siamese CNN (S-CNN) for person re-identification was presented in Yi et al. (2014) and Li et al. (2014). improvements such as Gated Siamese aimed at acquiring finer local patterns for discriminative capacity enhancement. metric learning approaches are exploited for similarity measurement. cross-view quadratic discriminant analysis (Liao et al., 2015), relative distance comparison optimization (PRDC algorithm), locally-adaptive decision functions (LADF) and etc. 2.2.2. state-of-the-art approaches built on CNN can be divided into two categories: bottom-up and top-down approaches. Deepcut (Pishchulin et al., 2016) casts the problem in the form of an Integer Linear Program (ILP) and proposed partitioning and labeling formulation jointly solve the task of detection and pose estimation. the latest work based on Mask-RCNN (Ren et al., 2015) extends Faster RCNN to predict human keypoints by combining the human bounding box and the corresponding feature map. Deepcut (Pishchulin et al., 2016) adopts the strategy of detecting all key points in the image first and then matching poses to individuals. globalNet for easy recognized keypoints and RefineNet for hard one. the recent work based on Mask-RCNN extends Faster RCNN to predict human keypoints by combining the human bounding box and the feature map. researchers explored the use of transfer learning to tackle the problem of dynamic multi-objective optimization (Jiang et al., 2018). this method can significantly speed up the evolutionary process by reusing past experience and generating an effective initial population pool. we describe our method as two main stages: (1) identifying the potentially-infected group, (2) modeling close proximity interaction. 3.1. Identifying the contact Graph The first step of our method is to identify the potentially-infected group of subjects. ximity Interaction We model the principle of close proximity interaction by extracting contextual knowledge from surveillance videos. the knowledge includes personal identity (acquired from the previous stage), spatial and temporal information. the latter two components describe the movement trajectories of individual persons in the 3D space. the risk R indicates the average distance of joints on the potentially-infected subject to J m * on the patient. we iterate this process for all identifiable subjects in the image. we use a graph representation to model the contact network. each edge E is a sequence involving two subjects SA, SB as the graph nodes. two subjects can be connected with multiple edges since two subjects can encounter each other at multiple locations. we compute the infection risk as: R = 1 N j i = 1 N j D ( J i, J m * ), i, j = 1,, N j (2) where Nj is the number of joints. risk R indicates the average distance of all joints on the potentially-infected subject to J m * on the patient. the task of person re-identification achieved 88.24% top-1 accuracy. mAP = 70.68% only with softmax loss. we use Adam Optimizer with the learning rate of 0.1, the batch size of 32, and the stride of 2. Dropout strategy is adopted to avoid the over-fitting problem. the drop rate is set to be 0.5. the HDA dataset is originally constructed for person re-identification. 18 cameras recorded simultaneously during 30 min in a typical indoor office scenario at a busy hour involving more than 80 persons. the cameras are located on three floors, and 13 cameras have been fully labeled. the relative size of the skeleton varies greatly, which is prone to influence the results of risk ranking. however, through the robust method combining depth and posture estimation, risk ranking results are satisfactory. participants were invited to the lab and conducted this experiment. they were instructed to rank the infection risk of all detected individuals in each video, given the diagnosed subject. they were not aware of the purpose of this study. in terms of time cost, our method requires far less time (3 s) to process one image. this is consistent with the high degree of consensus in the candidate selection. we believe this shows the advantages of our method in accuracy and efficiency. the model is trained on COCO dataset for 160k iterations starting from a learning rate of 0.02 and reducing it by 10 at 60k and 80k iterations. in RPN network, we use 5 scales with box area of the square of 32, 64, 128, 256 and 512 pixels for anchors. the increase in the number of people leads to greater time consumption. the time cost of multi-person pose estimation based on OpenPose is 0.8 s for 4,032 3, 024 pixels' image. thus, the total time cost of our method is no more than 3 s, far below the average time required by labor. the predicted distance between the two subjects is consistent with the perception in the real world. it shows that our method can reliably capture the interaction within close proximity. three typical scenarios are considered: a bus station, a bus compartment, and a hospital. Considering the pose information we use is two dimensional, it is difficult to determine the exact distance between people. written informed consent for the publication of this image was obtained from the identifiable persons. participants were invited to the lab and conducted this experiment. they were instructed to rank the infection risk of all detected individuals in each video, given the diagnosed subject. each participant spent 20 min to complete the study. the results show that the ranking order of infection risk is consistent between our method and human subjects. for the examples of both the bus station and the hospital, all participants identified the person closest to the diagnosed patient as the top candidate of infection risk. participants agreed that it is more difficult to decide since more than one candidate is located at a similar distance with the diagnosed patient. but since the rest of the candidates are not exposed to the high infection risk, their significance to infection control deserves less attention. the results show that the ranking order of infection risk is consistent between our method and human subjects. for the examples of both the bus station and the hospital, all participants identified the person closest to the diagnosed patient as the top candidate of infection risk. participants agreed that it is more difficult to decide since more than one candidate is located at a similar distance with the diagnosed patient. but they also mentioned that since the rest of the candidates are not exposed to the high infection risk, their significance to infection control deserves less attention. 5.1. Failure Case Analysis The building blocks critically determine the success of inferring the close proximity interaction in the upstream workflow. the state-of-the-art methods in person re-identification still face significant challenges in a complicated environment. the current accuracy of re-identification in our method is 88%. in selected scenarios, the method fails to identify the same person in two different camera views. this is caused by the relative perspective between the person in the view and the camera perspective. Object detection and tracking techniques will help to locate these objects. it is challenging to accurately determine whether a person is in direct contact with an object. if the object is sheltered from persons or multiple objects overlap each other, the visible part of the object is insufficient. deploying our method in an in-the-wild study could validate the effectiveness of our method in the real world. one potential scenario is to predict the absentee statistics of the childcare center, given the surveillance camera videos. this could offer advice to parents and administrators regarding the status of the disease infection on both individual and group levels."}
