{"summary": "infection control has not yet been achieved at a sufficient level. avian influenza [1], severe acute respiratory syndrome [2], and ebola hemorrhagic fever [3], many problematic diseases of tropical origin remain poorly controlled. a representative pathogenic virus, influenza virus, sometimes undergoes a process of discontinuous mutation. in this review, we outline strategies for the prevention and treatment of infections of the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts as representative infectious diseases. it is widely acknowledged that the main prophylactic measures against these infectious diseases are vaccinations and everyday hygienic behaviors such as gargling and hand-washing. vaccines are promising prophylactics against influenza infection. but their efficacy is limited by the frequent and fast mutation of RNA viruses including the influenza virus. rotavirus and norovirus are representative gastrointestinal pathogens that are highly infectious and cause severe diarrhea. commensal intestinal bacteria have been investigated for their ability to modulate the host immune system. they regulate regulatory T cells, type 3 innate lymphoid cells, and T helper 17 cells. probiotics act on both the innate and acquired immune systems and have the potency to decrease the severity of infections in the gastrointestinal [30] and upper respiratory tracts. ovirus (CMV) Healthy athletes Reduced plasma CMV and EBV antibody titers [34] Upper respiratory tract infection Elderly people No significant difference in the incidence of norovirus infection in elderly people [36] Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG Experimentally induced Rhinovirus infection. [45] Incidence of common infectious diseases Children aged 3\u20136 years Significantly lower incidence rate of common infectious diseases in DN-114 group. Lactobacillus plantarum L-137 Upper respiratory tract infection Healthy adults with high psycological stress Significant decrease in the incidence of upper respiratory tract infections. significant increase in IFN--inducible antiviral factor, interferon-stimulated gene 15 [56] Influenza-like illness and immunological response to influenza virus Healthy adults Significant decrease in the cumulative incidence days of cold-like symptoms. a potential mechanism was reported wherein LcS was found to modulate the activity of natural killer cells. a significant increase in serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels post-intervention was observed in children with gastroenteritis who were positive for either rotavirus or Cryptosporidium species in stool. a significant increase in serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels post-intervention was observed in children with rotavirus-induced diarrhea. lactobacillus paracasei MCC1849 (MCC1849) non-viable MCC1849 did not show significant effects on immune parameters involved in the response to influenza vaccination in elderly people with immunosenescence. the incidence and frequency of diarrhea were significantly reduced by supplementation with DN-114 as compared with the control group. the percentage change from baseline of the concanavalin A-induced proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) was significantly greater in the HK L-137-treated group than in the control group. serum IFN- production was not significantly different between these groups. idobacterium lactis B94 significantly shortened diarrheal period in acute rotavirus gastroenteritis children (5 months to 5 years old), compared with control oral rehydration alone. plasmacytoid dendritic cells play a crucial role in antiviral immunity through the production of large amounts of IFNs. in two separate studies, the expression of IFN- and the mRNA level of ISG15 in PBMCs were significantly higher in groups treated with L. lactis JCM 5805 as compared to the corresponding control groups. the effects of oral L. lactis JCM 5805 on systemic and mucosal immunological parameters of healthy volounteers in winter (common cold season in Japan) a significant increase in serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels post-intervention was observed in children with rotavirus-induced diarrhea who received LGG. yoghurt fermented with R-1 augmented NK cell activity and reduced the risk of catching the common cold in elderly individuals. L. casei 431 was demonstrated to modulate the immune system using a vaccination model in healthy subjects. increased from baseline in the titers of vaccine-specific IgG, IgG1 and IgG3 in plasma as well as that of vaccine-specific secretory IgA in saliva were significantly greater in both probiotic groups. the incidence of URTIs was significantly lower in the HK L-137-treated group than in the control group. in addition to the incidence of URTIs, the severity and duration of medication showed significant negative correlation with the duration of HK L-137 intake. anti-poliovirus-specific IgA and anti-rotavirus-specific IgA were assessed. Bb12 significantly increased anti-poliovirus-specific IgA, but not anti-rotavirus-specific IgA, although it showed the tendency of increase (P =0.056). the expression of IFN- and the mRNA level of ISG15 in PBMCs was significantly higher in groups treated with L. lactis JCM 5805 as compared with the control group. the effects of oral L. lactis JCM 5805 on systemic and mucosal immunological parameters of healthy volounteers in winter (common cold season in Japan) dendritic cells are subdivided into pDCs, myeloid DCs, and CD8+ dendritic cells. pDCs are a rare and critical subset that acts as a \u201ccontrol tower\u201d during viral infections. pDCs use certain TLRs to detect the presence of bacteria and viruses. direct activation of DCs by L. lactis JCM 5805 was found to be induced efficiently. however, IFN- production was completely abolished in dendritic cells obtained from TLR9 or MyD88 knockout mice. influenza virus (mPIV1) was inoculated intranasally to mice fed with L. lactis JCM5805. in the intestinal pDCs from the mice treated with L. lactis JCM 5805, type 1 IFN expression was significantly elevated. IFN- production by virus-stimulated pDCs markedly increased the cytotoxic activity of NK cells [73]. it is also possible that pDCs compete for viral receptors on the surface of target cells, produces antimicrobial and potentially antiviral substances, and stimulates host-cell immune defense systems. the phagocytosis of L. lactis JCM5805 by pDCs plays an important role in activating pDCs and stimulating IFN production via TLR9/MyD88 signaling. pDCs stained with anti-B220 (purple) are in the process of phagocytosing fluorescein isothiocyanate-stained L. lactis JCM5805 [55] type 1 IFN family includes IFN- and IFN-, which serve as components of the first-line defense against infection by blocking viral replication [65]. pathogenic bacteria including probiotics used in food preparation have been less intensively studied regarding their ability to stimulate DC-mediated IFNs induction [67]. L. lactis JCM 5805 was specifically taken up by pDC. phagocytosis played an important role in activating pDCs. cross-talk or direct contact between mDCs and pDCs was considered necessary. d2 (radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2) was observed upon treatment with L. lactis JCM 5805. oral treatment resulted in a strong resistance against parainfluenza virus infection in vivo. pDCs use certain toll-like receptor families to inactivate viruses. pDCs also use TLR9 for the recognition of microbial nucleic acids. the activation of pDCs by ligand binding to TLRs leads to type 1 IFNs. the effectiveness of probiotics and paraprobiotics is hindered by the large number of viral species and their subtypes as well as the high mutation rate of viruses. there have been several clinical reports regarding the use of probiotics or paraprobiotics for the prophylaxis or treatment of infectious diseases."}
