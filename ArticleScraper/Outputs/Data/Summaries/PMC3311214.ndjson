{"summary": "most cases in this study were pediatric cases reported to CDC through the Influenza-associated pediatric Mortality Surveillance system. a total of 442 influenza-associated deaths among children (18 years old) and young adults (18\u201340 years old) residing in the united states were reported to CDC for the 1998\u201399 through 2007\u201308 influenza seasons. 105 cases with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection had sufficient tissue specimens available for DNA extraction. DNA quality was assessed with a human RNase P real-time PCR in 25-L volumes by using Agilent Brilliant II QPCR Master Mix. each genotype consisted of 12.5 L of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) for MBL2, we examined 5 SNPS, 3 in the coding region of exon 1 and 2 in the promoter region. the wild-type is A (7,8); these variants are typically pooled and designated as the O allele. BL producers were combined into 1 group and compared with MBL low-producers. prevalence of genetic variants among cases was compared with population-based prevalence estimates for the same genetic variants. the 12\u201319-year age group is the youngest age group available in the NHANES DNA bank. the null hypothesis was that there was no difference in minor allele frequency between the groups and the reference sample. a priori group examined included previously healthy case-patients, case-patients 5 years old, case-patients with invasive bacterial co-infection, and case-patients with sudden death. 105 cases with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection had sufficient tissue specimens available for DNA extraction. a total of 442 influenza-associated deaths among children (18 years old) and young adults (18\u201340 years old) were reported to CDC for the 1998\u201399 through 2007\u201308 influenza seasons. s were used to genotype each SNP (protocols, primers, and probes available at http://snp500cancer.nci.nih.gov). each 25-L real-time PCR consisted of 12.5 L of TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix, 900 nmol of assay-specific primer, 200 nmol of assay-specific probe, and 5 L of DNA. promoter polymorphisms at positions 550 (H/L variant, rs11003125) and 221 (X/Y variant, rs7096206) encode variants that mediate MBL2 expression. case-patients homozygous or compound heterozygous for any of the 3 variant structural alleles and case-patients with a variant structural allele on 1 chromosome were categorized as low MBL producers. the 12\u201319-year age group is the youngest age group available in the NHANES DNA bank. cases were stratified by presence or absence of chronic medical conditions in patients known to increase the risk for influenza-associated complications. data were obtained only from deceased case-patients. 105 cases had available autopsy specimens with sufficient DNA for genotyping. there were no significant differences in the distribution of influenza types by season between cases and the national pattern of types found in the US viral surveillance system. influenza season 1998\u201399 1 (1) 0 0 2000\u201301 1 (1) 0 1 (1) 2001\u201302 2 (2) 0 2 (1) 2002\u201303 10 (10) 0 10 (2) 2003\u201304 33 (31) 121 (36) 154 (35) 2004\u201305 7 (7) 44 (13) 51 (12) 2005\u201306 6 (6) 42 (12) 48 (11) 2006\u201307 22 (21) 60 (18) 82 (19) 2007\u201308 23 (22) 70 (21) 93 (21) Influenza type A 81 (77) a 2 test of difference in proportion was used to test differences in proportion between genotyped and ungenotyped cases except for patient age, season, and length of illness. 442 possible or confirmed influenza-related deaths among children (18 years old) and young adults (18\u201340 years old) were reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from 1998\u201399 through 2007\u201308. differences in these characteristics are difficult to interpret because genotyped case-patients were less likely to have received medical care for their illnesses. n = 105 White, n = 64 Black, n = 18 Asian. allele 0.052 0.023 0.194 0 rs5030737 (D variant) 34CC 95 (90) 55 (86) 17 (94) 7 (100) 34CT 9 (9) 8 (13) 1 (6) 0 34TT 1 (1) (1) 1 (2) 0 0 T allele 0.052 0.078 0.028 0 rs7096206 (X/Y variant) 221CC 71 (68) 43 (67) 14 (78) 4 (57) 221CG high 57 (54) 36 (56) 7 (39) 5 (71) *Cases include 16 patients with missing/unknown or other race. low producers included truncated haplotypes O/O and XA/O. the minor allele frequency of rs5030737 was significantly less common among case-patients 5 years old than in the reference sample. low-producing MBL2 genotypes also associated with an approximate 3-fold increased risk for bacterial co-infection in general and with S. aureus infection overall.

MBL has been shown to strongly bind S. aureus (31) and susceptibility to fatal S. aureus infection due to MBL deficiency has been convincingly demonstrated in murine models (32). Phase I clinical trials of MBL replacement therapy indicate that this therapy is well tolerated and effective at improving MBL deficiency in healthy persons (33). the study cohort is the largest sample of fatal influenza cases in children and young adults. we had access to limited information about racial and ethnic background of case-patients. despite these shortcomings, the possibility that specific variants of the MBL2 gene known to influence serum MBL levels appear to be associated with severe bacterial co-infection is an intriguing finding. no evidence suggesting low-producing MBL genotypes are associated with increased risk for asthma (40), this finding may be worth further exploration in future studies. an obvious next step is examination of all functional variants of the MBL2 gene in conjunction with gene expression."}
