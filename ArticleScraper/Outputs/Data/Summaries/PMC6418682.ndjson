{"summary": "nanoparticles, with the size range from 10.0 to 100.0 nm in diameter, have unique features including high surface area, quantum property as well as adsorption and releasing properties. nanoparticles have unique features including high surface area, quantum property as well as adsorption and releasing properties, exhibiting great potential in multifunctional applications. polysaccharides are considered as the most promising hosts in the synthesis of polysaccharide based metallic nanoparticles (PMNPs) with guest metallic ion and hydrophobic chemical drugs such as doxorubicin, levofloxacin, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, and ciprofloxacin. polysaccharides can also act as good reducing and stabilizing agents to regulate the physical properties of PMNPs during synthesis a basic introduction of the utilization of natural polysaccharides as guest molecules, conjugated with the host molecules metal ions or MNPs to form PMNPs is given. the potential toxic risks are demonstrated with both in vitro and in vivo evaluation. the selection of synthesis approach is crucial in achieving the appropriate properties of nanoparticles [30] bottom-up synthesis (self-assembly) is the most frequently chosen approach in the preparation of PMNPs. a metallic precursor is either decomposed or reduced to zero-valent state to form the building blocks (smaller entities), followed by the nucleation and nanocrystals growth. the stereogenic centers of polysaccharides will also benefit for the anchoring of the MNPs. electrochemical synthetic techniques were considered to have great potential in the regulation of PMNPs synthesis. other techniques that could control the synthesis of PMNPs such as microemulsion and photoinduced reduction also need to be attempted in further study. TEM is introduced in the characterization of nanoparticles. it can be used to determine particle size, dispersion and aggregation in aqueous environment with a high spatial resolution. TEM can provide more details at the atomic scale such as crystal structure. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the primary tool for the determination of the crystal property of PMNPs such as crystallite size and lattice strain [59] small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) can provide the information of the crystalline and amorphous PMNPs. the crystallite size of the PMNPs is not exactly the same as the particle size due to the polycrystalline aggregates of nanoparticles. applications of PMNPs are introduced in wound healing, targeted delivery, biosensing, catalysis and agents with antimicrobial, antiviral and anticancer capabilities. the poor effectiveness and overuse of these agents has led to growing drug resistance of pathogenic bacterial and fungi strains, especially multidrug resistance strains. AgNPs stabilized by different polysaccharides have effective antimicrobial effects on both Gram-positive bacteria, such as S. epidermidis, S. aureus, S. subtilis, B. subtilis, B. fermentum, E. faecium, B. licheniformis, B. cereus, B. rhizophila, S. pyogenes, Actinomycetes, Staphylococcus, S. pneumoniae it has been reported that the binding of Ag+ to oligonucleotides would cause changes in the fluorescence excitation and emission spectrum. 3D fluorescence spectroscopy was introduced to investigate the interaction between Ag+ and DNA of bacteria. minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is widely applied to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of PMNPs against bacteria and fungi that cultured in liquid medium. astragalus membranaceus root Crude polysaccharides Ag 65.1 Spherical S. aureus, E. coli, S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa [69] - Pullulan Ag 2.0\u201330.0 Spherical/ oval-shaped E. coli, K. pneumoniae, L. monocytogenes, P. aeruginosa, Aspergillus spp., Penicillum spp trastromatica Fucoidan Ag 17.0 Spherical B. subtilis, Bacillus sp.
