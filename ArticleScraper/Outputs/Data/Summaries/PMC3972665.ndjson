{"summary": "HSV-2 is responsible for recurrent genital ulcers, cold sores, herpetic stromal keratitis and fatal encephalitis. it contributes to morbidity seen in immunocompromised individuals and neonates with severe infection. development of a prophylactic vaccine to achieve sterilizing immunity is highly desirable. cell control of HSV-2 is not well understood, however emerging data has highlighted the importance of CD8+ T cell control in HSV-2 reactivation. tegument protein specific T cells may play an important role in controlling HSV-2 infection and provide attractive opportunities for immune intervention. VP22 and VP13/14 we sought to identify epitope sequences in a preclinical mouse model using a combination of computational prediction, ELISpot and flow cytometry methods. responses to VP22 and VP13/14 have also been demonstrated in humans [22] the peptides derived from ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 were identified based on the ability to bind Kd, Dd, Ld and HLA-A*02 MHC molecules using the Immune Epitope Database [24]. the sequence from ICP27(318-326) has previously been shown to elicit strong T cell responses in preclinical experiments.

T2 cells were used to determine the affinity index of peptides able to bind and stabilize HLA-A*02 MHC molecules. four peptide sequences, ICP27(314-322),VP22(146-154),VP22(173-181), VP13/14(242-250) were able to reach an AI > 1.5 (high affinity) LA-A2 restricted Flu matrix M1(58-66) (GILGFVFTL) peptide was used as positive control at the same concentration as the HSV-2 test peptides. peptide binding affinity was calculated from the formula: AI = (MFI1\u2013 MFI0)/(MFI2 \u2013 MFI0) and the dotted line represents an AI of 1.5 (high affinity) table 3 summarizes the HLA-A2 epitopes identified in this study. the set threshold for high affinity binding peptides was given an AI of 1.5. for intermediate affinity peptides was given an AI of 1.25\u20131.5.

CD8+ T cells degranulating in response to VP13/14 and VP13/14 peptide stimulation after VP13/14 DNA immunization were present at a modest frequency of 1.3% of total CD8+ T cells. mice immunized with a mock antigen and pulsed with ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 peptides. potential role of ICP27 in protection against HSV challenge. vaccinated mice showed a trend towards lower clinical scores. ICP27 vaccinated (closed triangle), mock vaccinated (open rhombus) and naive (closed squares) groups at each day for fourteen days post-infection. additional work using T cell lines and clones sorted from HSV-2 patients in transwell and migration experiments may allow better understanding. mice infected with HSV-2 also showed a greater coverage of epitope specific responses than with DNA vaccination. further work is required to dissect the proportion of HSV-2 pentamer/tetramer specific CD8+/CD107a+ cells capable of mounting IFN-+, IL-2+ and TNF-+ responses. based on the ability to bind Kd, Dd, Ld and HLA-A*02 MHC molecules using the Immune Epitope Database [24]. the sequence from ICP27(318-326) has previously been shown to elicit strong T cell responses in preclinical experiments and was included as a positive control.

HLA-A2+ donor (1185) with % sequence homology to HSV-1. set threshold for high affinity binding peptides given AI of 1.5. intermediate affinity peptides given AI of 1.25\u20131.5. two papers were published that described peptide selection, pre-clinical efficacy and phase I clinical trial data for a polyvalent anti-HSV-2 vaccine. they included a single 35 amino acid peptide from ICP27 (amino acids 410-444), but did not include any peptides from VP22 or VP13/14. the aim of those studies was to generate both CD4+ and CD8+ cellular immunity. gold particles containing 2 g of DNA were given as a single actuation to the shaved abdomen of BALB/c mice without adjuvant. mice were then given a second booster vaccine 29 days after the primary immunization. topes, VP22(46-54), VP22(171-179) and VP22(200-208) were present at a modest frequency of 1.3% of total CD8+ T cells. BALB/c mice (n = 6) were immunized using the DNA prime-boost regimen. vaccinated mice showed a trend towards lower clinical scores than unvaccinated counterparts. a DNA vaccine against ICP27 was used to immunize mice prior to challenge with HSV-2 in intravaginal and intranasal. CD8+ T cell recruitment to sites of infection has recently been shown to depend heavily upon CXCR3+ CD4+ T cell induced mobilization through the CXCL9 and CXCL10 gradient. this important finding suggests that vaccines should be designed to induce both CD8+ T cells with CD4+ T cell help. SV-2 showed a greater coverage of epitope specific responses than with DNA vaccination which skewed ICP27 and VP22 specific responses to ICP27(318-326), ICP27(500-508) and VP22(200-208) epitopes. further work is required to dissect the proportion of HSV-2 pentamer/tetramer specific CD8+/CD107a+ cells capable of mounting IFN-+, IL-2+ and TNF-+ in total, 44 peptides were selected with theoretical IC50 values ranging from 21.5 to 45487.2 nM spanning selected regions of ICP27, VP22 and VP13/14 proteins. overlapping amino acid sequences of differing IC50 values spanning 15-mer sequences were included to assess the impact of residue modifications on the extent of immunogenicity. the control group (n = 2) were given PBS by the intravaginal route. mice were monitored for 14 days and their health was checked daily using a clinical score system. splenocytes were harvested by mechanical disruption and washed twice in serum free cell culture media. the splenocytes were then resuspended in R10 and plated out on PVDF (polyvinylidene difluoride)-backed microplate (Millipore), at a concentration of 5 105 cells/well. 174 CEM.T2) mutant hybrid cell line derived from the T-lymphoblast cell line CEM was obtained from the ATCC.
