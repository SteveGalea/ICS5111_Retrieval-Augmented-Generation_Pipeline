{"summary": "the total outbreak size is now estimated at 29 000 documented cases. early model projections forecasted more than 1 million cases. many online transmission stories events recounted online. METHODS Between august and October 2014, we conducted a human search and review of publicly available Internet resources to find and record person-level accounts of Ebola transmission in west africa. our preferred (sought out) online sources were those that had records of reporting as news organizations for the populations in the affected areas. 'now' in Utah, USA is different than 'now' in Lagos, Nigeria. the gamma distribution was chosen for consistency in comparing our results to those derived from world health organisation (WHO) data. RESULTS We accessed a total of 5340 web pages from 293 unique web domains. from our internet search, a final set of 116 online news stories were used to build the transmission chain segments. we used the simpler likelihood function above to reduce computational time required to perform sufficient bootstrapping. each news source had the potential to confirm or refute facts. each news source had the potential to open additional paths for investigation through new clues. table 1 provides a classification of these 116 online sources by type of epidemiological information gleaned and by origin of the online source. three major sections of the chain included Ebola transmission involving an herbalist who seeded one of the major Sierra Leone chains. a chain comprised of two large clusters stemming from a single Ebola case (the left-most line in Fig. 1). we estimate that a low-resolution chain could have been constructed by mid-September 2014. the final resolution with reliable parameters would have required a further 3\u20134 weeks (mid-to-late October) for the information to be available from the online sources we used. based on the maximum likelihood fit of the gamma distribution, we estimated the mean incubation period to be 125 days (95% CI 106\u2013145 days) the 5th percentile incubation period result was 63 days (48 the estimates in Van Kerkhove et al. are based on a review of other published estimates, including those listed here as WHO 2014, WHO 2015, and Faye et al. DISCUSSION We have demonstrated that reviewing news reports and online sources originating primarily within the countries ravaged by Ebola in West Africa yielded details sufficient to create transmission trees of infection. unpopular details may include politically/culturally unpopular events that might not be found in official reports. a paper by Majumder et al. [14] involved assembly of an extensive list of MERS-CoV cases from a 2014 outbreak in Saudi Arabia. Cleaton, Majumder, and Chowell papers reported successful builds of 104 clusters of Ebola virus disease using WHO reports, situational reports, and \u2018online authoritative media outlets\u2019. compared with the MMWR report, our first-generation case disease onset times tended to be nearly 1 week. both transmission trees show 13 cases linked to the index case. the branches related to port Harcourt secondary and tertiary cases are in agreement. a professional contact to the index case fled to port Harcourt. incubation time data from Ebola patients collected from online sources produced estimates of both the mean and 95th percentile. remarkably similar to those produced by WHO 2014 study [5], which required detailed investigation of thousands of patients by workers in the affected countries. internet sources can be used to derive reasonably accurate estimates of useful incubation statistics. the bulk of the transmissions happened after the hospital's medical director fell ill but was wrongly declared Ebola negative. about 5 days before this test, the medical director had direct contact with a symptomatic Ebola patient. after the initial negative test result, many of those caring for the medical director believed he was suffering with malaria. 'epidemiologic theory reminds us that our work has a context, and that this context is human society' sometimes informants speculate, descriptions of people and events can be ambiguous. stories may be updated without highlighting that corrections were made. the true extent of the outbreak would likely not be known from newspaper reports. it is likely that we could reproduce this strategy for another cluster of cases in the recent Ebola outbreak or another public health crisis. the key factor is the availability of person-level details."}
