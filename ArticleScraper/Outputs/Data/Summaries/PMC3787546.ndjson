{"summary": "the world health organization estimates that asthma accounts for 1 in every 250 deaths worldwide. prevalence of asthma in developed countries is approximately 10% in adults and even higher in children. in developing countries, the prevalence is lower but increasing rapidly. airway inflammation in asthma is characterized by allergic phenotypes, such as dense infiltration of eosinophils and T helper type 2 lymphocytes. that of COPD is mainly accumulation of neutrophils, CD8-positive cytotoxic T cells, and activated macrophages. inflammation affects predominantly small airways, while in COPD, inflammation affects predominantly small airways and the lung parenchyma. asthma COPD Age at onset At any age (usually 40 years) Usually >40 years Smoking history Possible Usually between 2 and 6 am Gradual increase Sputum production Infrequent Common Allergy (eczema or allergic rhinitis) Common Infrequent Airway inflammation Main portion Large airways Pathophysiology Basement-membrane thickening Fibrosis of small airways Increased airway smooth muscle Destruction of alveolar walls Bronchial biop overlap syndrome accounts for about 15\u201325% of obstructive airway disease. it shows more frequent or severe exacerbations and higher mortality than COPD alone. it is crucial to recognize and understand the clinical features of asthma and COPD patients. rhinovirus (HRV) in asthmatic (10.1%) and healthy participants (8.5%) were similar. there is little evidence that treating or preventing the infection may cure or prevent an exacerbation. there is no clear consensus definition for asthma exacerbation. asthma exacerbations are acute or subacute episodes of progressively worsening shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. a joint task force of the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society has recently defined asthma exacerbations as events characterized by a change from the patient\u2019s previous status. virus most commonly implicated in asthma exacerbations appears to be HRV. other respiratory tract viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumoviruses (HMPVs), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses (AdVs) and bocaviruses, have all been detected in subjects with asthma exacerbations. sensitivity rates for oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and nasopharyngeal washings (NPW) were 54.2, 73.3, and 84.9% respectively. bronchoalveolar lavage cells were positive for HRV RNA during infection in 80% of samples, whereas nasal lavage fluid was positive in 100%. the most important viruses relevant to asthma development are RSV and HRV. by 1 year of age, 50\u201365% of children will have been infected with this virus. by 2 years of age nearly 100% has been infected. HRV is the most important virus type associated with exacerbations of asthma leading to hospital admission in both adults and children. HRV is the most common and important cause of exacerbation in both children and adults. AdVs are associated with up to 7% of virus-related asthma exacerbations. it has been demonstrated that 94% of children with refractory asthma has detectable AdV antigens compared with 0% of controls. have reported mycoplasmal infection in up to 25% of children with wheezing or identified it in 20% of exacerbations in asthmatic children requiring hospitalization. other specific pathogens have been shown to increase mucus secretion, which is recognized in asthma or COPD. respiratory virus infection induces production of various cytokines or chemokines. this inflammatory process may be amplified by intrinsic factors. studies show a deficiency in interferon (IFN)- and IFN- production in response to HRV inoculation in airway epithelial cells cultured from asthmatic versus normal subjects. chlamydial acute upper respiratory infections were associated with mean decreases in peak expiratory flow of > 50 L/min. chlamydial acute upper respiratory infections was associated with mean decreases in peak expiratory flow of >25 L/min. respiratory pathogens were implicated in almost half of most severe asthma exacerbations with a > 50 L/min mean decrease in peak expiratory flow. palivizumab treatment in healthy preterm infants reduced wheezing days during the first year of life. several therapeutic strategies would need to be taken early in the course of infection to maximize the effects of treatments such as systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics if necessary. the term virus-induced exacerbation of asthma is not uncommon, but only a small number of such studies were prospective. there is little evidence that treating or preventing an exacerbation may cure or prevent an exacerbation. asthma exacerbations are acute or subacute episodes of progressively worsening shortness of breath, cough, wheezing, and chest tightness. a joint task force of the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society has recently defined asthma exacerbations as events characterized by a change from the patient\u2019s previous status. virus most commonly implicated in asthma exacerbations appears to be HRV. other respiratory tract viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumoviruses (HMPVs), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses (AdVs) and bocaviruses, have all been detected in subjects with asthma exacerbations. sensitivity rates for oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and nasopharyngeal washings (NPW) were 54.2, 73.3, and 84.9% respectively. bronchoalveolar lavage cells were positive for HRV RNA during infection in 80% of samples, whereas nasal lavage fluid was positive in only 37%. the most important viruses relevant to asthma development are RSV and HRV. by 1 year of age, 50\u201365% of children will have been infected with this virus. by 2 years of age nearly 100% has been infected. HRV is the most important virus type associated with exacerbations of asthma. it is the most common and important cause of exacerbation in both children and adults. HRV is the most common and important cause of exacerbation in both children and adults. denoviruses are associated with up to 7% of virus-related asthma exacerbations. they cause diarrhea, keratoconjunctivitis, and hemorrhagic cystitis. it has been demonstrated that 94% of children with refractory asthma has detectable AdV antigens. ABPA is a unique form of asthma caused by colonization of the LRT. it is caused by an exaggerated T helper type 2 response to the ubiquitous mold Aspergillus spp., by which colonization leads to allergic and/or asthma symptoms. respiratory virus infection induces production of various cytokines or chemokines. this inflammatory process may be amplified by intrinsic factors. studies show a deficiency in interferon (IFN)- and IFN- production. respiratory pathogens were implicated in almost half of most severe asthma exacerbations with a > 50 L/min mean decrease in peak expiratory flow. patients should be aware of decreased peak expiratory flow, URT, or LRT symptoms associated with viral infections. palivizumab treatment in healthy preterm infants reduced wheezing days during the first year of life. several therapeutic strategies would need to be taken early in the course of infection to maximize the effects of treatments such as systemic corticosteroids and antibiotics if necessary. a joint task force of the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society has recently defined asthma exacerbations as events characterized by a change from the patient\u2019s previous status. moderate exacerbations were defined as the status of an asthmatic patient who required a prompt change in treatment due to being outside the patient\u2019s usual range of day-to-day asthma variation. virus most commonly implicated in asthma exacerbations appears to be HRV. other respiratory tract viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumoviruses (HMPVs), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), adenoviruses (AdVs) and bocaviruses, have all been detected in subjects with asthma exacerbations. sensitivity rates for oropharyngeal swabs (OPS), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) and nasopharyngeal washings (NPW) were 54.2, 73.3, and 84.9% respectively. bronchoalveolar lavage cells were positive for HRV RNA during infection in 80% of samples, whereas nasal lavage fluid was positive in only 37%. the most important viruses relevant to asthma development are RSV and HRV. by 1 year of age, 50\u201365% of children will have been infected with this virus. by 2 years of age nearly 100% has been infected. HRV is the most important virus type associated with exacerbations of asthma leading to hospital admission in both adults and children. the detection rates of HRV in asthmatic (10.1%) and healthy participants (8.5%) were similar. AdVs are associated with up to 7% of virus-related asthma exacerbations. they cause diarrhea, keratoconjunctivitis, and hemorrhagic cystitis. most asthma studies describe relatively low levels of influenza viruses. ABPA is a unique form of asthma caused by colonization of the LRT. it is caused by an exaggerated T helper type 2 response to the ubiquitous mold Aspergillus spp., by which colonization leads to allergic and/or asthma symptoms. respiratory virus infection induces production of various cytokines or chemokines. this inflammatory process may be amplified by intrinsic factors (susceptibility gene, family history of atopy, lung development) or environmental factors (respiratory virus infection, allergen exposure, smoking, and air pollutants, etc.) respiratory pathogens were implicated in almost half of most severe asthma exacerbations with a > 50 L/min mean decrease in peak expiratory flow. the latter effect can persist for several weeks after infection, presenting as LRT symptoms. term infants born at a gestational age of 33\u201335 weeks reduced wheezing days during the first year of life. several therapeutic strategies would need to be taken early in the course of infection to maximize the effects of treatments such as systemic corticosteroids, antibiotics if necessary, and short-acting -agonist inhalers. tiotropium improved lung function and reduced the chance of rescue inhaler (SABA) in patients with overlap syndrome. in-hospital mortality rate of patients admitted to the hospital with exacerbations of COPD was 8%, increasing to 23% after 1 year of follow-up. in-hospital mortality rate of patients admitted with exacerbations of COPD was 8%, increasing to 23% after 1 year of follow-up. a subgroup of COPD patients appeared to be susceptible to exacerbations. other factors for exacerbations were environmental factors, such as seasons or inhalation of harmful substances. exacerbations are predominantly caused by bacterial and viral respiratory infections. the major viruses associated with exacerbations of COPD were HRV (3.1\u201326.6%), RSV (0.7\u201340.5%), and influenza virus (2.0\u201322.4%) the major viruses associated with exacerbations were HRV (3.1\u201326.6%), RSV (0.7\u201340.5%), and influenza virus (2.0\u201322.4%) HRV human rhinovirus was the most detected virus during exacerbations of COPD. other viruses, such as PIV, human metapneumovirus, and coronavirus, were also noted. lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a key pro-allergic cytokine that has recently been linked to asthma. TSLP may contribute to exacerbations of the pathogenic effects of HRV infection via a toll-like receptor (TLR)3-dependent pathway. greenberg et al. investigated viral infections with or without COPD in a longitudinal cohort study. they demonstrated that annual symptomatic documented respiratory viral infection rates were similar for COPD and age-matched controls. however, the COPD patients had more office visits and hospitalization than controls. changes in neutrophil counts during exacerbations in both sputum and peripheral blood have been found to be related to the FEV1.0 value. levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8 in sputum were associated with neutrophilic inflammation. inflammatory cytokines in sputum during exacerbations have been found to be elevated regardless of whether the infection is viral or bacterial. tiotropium (LAMA)-treated group had lower exacerbation rate than salmeterol (LABA)-treated group. combination LAMA/LABA therapy improved pulmonary function (FEV1.0) and respiratory symptoms better than LAMA therapy alone. treatment with macrolide antibiotics has been reported to prevent COPD exacerbations. steroid treatment did not affect viral load or shedding, and humoral immunity may be diminished by steroid treatment. steroid treatment may inhibit HRV and RSV infections by reducing levels of intercellular adhesion molecule-1. exacerbations of COPD are neither defined consistently nor matched in individual studies. in the INSPIRE study, the annual rate of event-based exacerbations of COPD was 0.85\u20131.30 per patient per year. the rate of symptom-based exacerbations was about two times as high as that of event-based exacerbations. bacteria (H. influenzae, S. pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and P. aeruginosa) and respiratory viruses (HRV, RSV, influenza virus, HMPV, coronavirus, and AdVs) were recognized during exacerbations. the role of atypical respiratory pathogens, such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae, in exacerbations of COPD is poorly recognized. viral detections accounted for 22\u201357% of exacerbations of COPD in recent studies. major viruses associated with exacerbations were HRV (3.1\u201326.6%), RSV (0.7\u201340.5%), and influenza virus (2.0\u201322.4%) tymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is a key pro-allergic cytokine that has recently been linked to asthma. TSLP may contribute to exacerbations of the pathogenic effects of HRV infection via a toll-like receptor (TLR)3-dependent pathway. RSV detection in stable COPD patients might be associated with insidious airway inflammation and accelerated decline in FEV1.0. but this was not confirmed by another study (Falsey et al., 2006a). influenza vaccination prevented exacerbations in COPD patients. patients hospitalized with COPD exacerbations had lower serum levels of rhinovirus-specific antibodies than those not hospitalized with COPD exacerbations. TSLP may contribute to exacerbations of the pathogenic effects of HRV infection via a toll-like receptor (TLR)3-dependent pathway. a meta-analysis showed that influenza vaccination prevented exacerbations in COPD patients. anti-viral treatment such as neuraminidase inhibitors may reduce severity of disease. pathological features of COPD are fibrosis around small airways. fibrosis around small airways involving several different cells. changes in neutrophil counts during exacerbations in both sputum and peripheral blood have been found to be related to the FEV1.0 value. serum C-X-C motif chemokine 10 (CXCL10) is implicated as a more potent predictive maker for virus-associated exacerbations. it is known as IFN-induced protein 10. TREATMENT OF STABLE AND EXACERBATION STATES LAMA and LABA are the main pharmacological therapies in stable COPD patients. exacerbations of COPD include SABAs, short-course systemic glucocorticoids, and antibiotics. treatment for influenza appears appropriate in patients with COPD. it is doubtful that systemic corticosteroid treatment affects the clinical course of respiratory viral infections. conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
