{"summary": "reassortment between a wild-type (wt) IAV and a genetically tagged variant (var) of the same strain is measured (12) this system avoids genetic incompatibility between coinfecting viruses and thereby facilitates detection of virus-extrinsic effects on reassortment efficiency. reassortment is highly efficient in a coinfected host. human seasonal IAVs can replicate in epithelial cells derived from multiple sites throughout the human respiratory tract (13\u201315) zoonotic IAVs derived from avian hosts may favor the LRT over upper respiratory tract sites (25\u201329) this feature of infection likely contributes to severe disease in human cases of subtype H5N1 and H7N9 IAV infection. reassortment is highly efficient in intranasally coinoculated ferrets. reassortment is highly efficient in intranasally coinoculated ferrets. reassortment is severely restricted when viruses are introduced at distinct anatomical sites. approximately 20 plaque isolates derived from each time point were genotyped by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) followed by high-resolution melt analysis. the results of this genotyping assay are displayed in Fig. 1 for NL/09wt plus NL/09var virus coinfections and in Fig. 2 for pan/99wt plus pan/99var virus coinfections. infectious titers of nasal swab samples are plotted as a function of time postinoculation. the diversity of viral gene constellations detected is represented for each ferret, with days p.i. indicated in grayscale. each sample's Simpson index value was converted to a corresponding Hill number to derive its effective diversity. swab titers of NL/09 wt/var-coinfected ferrets tended to be higher than the swab titers of pan/99 wt/var-coinfected animals on d1 postinoculation (P = 0.088, t test), suggesting a more rapid expansion of the NL/09-based inoculum (see panel B in Fig. 1 and 2). the sites targeted by these two routes of inoculation are shown in Fig. 3. the intranasal (IN) and intratracheal (IT) inoculations were performed at the same time. these experiments were performed with wt/var virus pairings in the NL/09 background and in the Pan/99 background. both intranasal (I.N.) and intratracheal (I.T.) inoculations led to productive viral infection in ferrets coinfected with pan/99wt plus pan/99var virus. infectious titers in tissue homogenates were determined by TCID50 assay. the limit of detection for infectious virus was 1.5 log10TCID50/ml. most plaque isolates retained parental genotype of the virus instilled intranasally. the limit of detection for a given viral genotype is relatively high, at 5%. low levels of reassortment (5%) could be important in a natural context. wt virus intratracheally was inoculated with 1 105 TCID50 of Pan/99wt and 1 105 TCID50 of Pan/99wt and Pan/99wt virus intratracheally. nasal swabs were collected and virus therein analyzed to generate the data shown. red bars indicate segments derived from the pan/99wt virus. turquoise bars show segments derived from the pan/99var virus. reassortment in upper respiratory tract samples was rare. ferrets were inoculated with 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09wt and 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09var viruses. Throat swabs were collected and virus therein analyzed to generate the data shown. red bars indicate segments derived from the pan/99wt virus. turquoise bars show segments derived from the pan/99var virus. titers of throat swab samples plotted as a function of time postinoculation. approximately 20 plaque isolates derived from each time point were genotyped by reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) followed by high-resolution melt analysis. the results of this genotyping assay are displayed in Fig. 1 for NL/09wt plus NL/09var virus coinfections and in Fig. 2 for pan/99wt plus pan/99var virus coinfections. infectious titers of nasal swab samples are plotted as a function of time postinoculation. the diversity of viral gene constellations detected is represented for each ferret, with days p.i. indicated in grayscale. each sample's Simpson index value was converted to a corresponding Hill number to derive its effective diversity. swab titers of NL/09 wt/var-coinfected ferrets tended to be higher than the swab titers of pan/99 wt/var-coinfected animals on d1 postinoculation (P = 0.088, t test), suggesting a more rapid expansion of the NL/09-based inoculum. reassortment is restricted when infection is initiated at distinct anatomic anatomical sites accessed for (A) inoculation, (B) swab collection, and (C) tissue collection are shown schematically in Fig. 3. in each animal, the virus instilled intranasally strongly predominated in the nasal turbinates. both intranasal (I.N.) and intratracheal (I.T.) inoculations led to productive viral infection in ferrets coinfected with pan/99wt plus pan/99var virus. infectious titers in tissue homogenates were determined by TCID50 assay. the limit of detection for infectious virus was 1.5 log10TCID50/ml. the majority of plaque isolates retained the parental genotype of the virus instilled intranasally. the limit of detection for a given viral genotype is relatively high, at 5%. low levels of reassortment (5%) could be important in a natural context. t virus intratracheally in nasal swab samples. nasal swabs were collected and virus therein analyzed. titers of nasal swab samples are plotted as a function of time postinoculation. the diversity of viral gene constellations detected is represented for each ferret, with days p.i. in grayscale. ferrets were inoculated with 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09wt and 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09var viruses. Throat swabs were collected and virus therein analyzed. red bars indicate segments derived from the pan/99wt virus. turquoise bars show segments derived from the pan/99var virus. white bars indicate segments where the genotyping result was not clear. ferrets inoculated with pan/99-based wt and var viruses resulted in robust viral replication in the lower respiratory tract (21, 35, 36) reassortment efficiency in vivo was performed in a guinea pig model using wt and var viruses. earlier work revealed high levels of reassortment under 'baseline' conditions of simultaneous, intranasal coinoculation (12, 34) the lack of viral spread from the LRT to the URT may be the result of an active exclusion of superinfection at the level of the tissue. a simpler mechanism in which virus fails to travel up the trachea to the URT may be responsible. this mechanism is consistent with previous observations regarding the time window within which Pan/99 virus superinfection can be achieved in the upper respiratory tract of guinea pigs. noculation is an earlier time point than that at which virus was first detected in the URT in ferrets inoculated only via the IT route (40, 41). the site of inoculation strongly influences the site of subsequent viral replication and is therefore likely to impact the probability of reassortment in nature. avian IAV infections of humans are often characterized by viral growth in the lungs. large respiratory droplets at >20 m in diameter are likely to be deposited within the upper respiratory tract, with essentially no penetration beyond the trachea. a significant proportion of droplets that are 5 m in diameter penetrate all the way to the alveolar region (32, 49), thus, viruses transmitted via differing modes may be less likely to meet within a coinfected host. the NL/09var virus carries a single synonymous mutation per segment relative to the pH1N1wt virus. these silent mutations act as genetic markers for determining the parental origin of gene segments following isolation of progeny viruses from coinfected ferrets. the NL/09-based viruses were cultured in 9-to-11-day-old embryonated chicken's eggs incubated at 33\u00b0C. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) 1 h after inoculation. were cultured in infection media, consisting of serum-free supplemented EMEM containing 20 g/ml trypsin (Lonza) three days after inoculation, supernatants of cell cultures were tested for agglutinating activity. male male ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09wt virus and 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09var virus in a 40-l volume. four ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09var virus in a 40-l volume, with 20 l instilled in each nostril. two ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 1 105 TCID50 of Pan/99wt virus (20 l in each nostril) and intratracheally with 1 ml containing 105 TCID50 of Pan/99var virus (ferrets F15 and F16). Throat and nose swabs were collected daily for 7 days and were stored at 80\u00b0C in transport medium. RNA was extracted from agar plugs using a high pure RNA isolation kit. cDNA was used as the template in qPCRs with the appropriate primers. qPCR and melt analyses were carried out in a CFX384 real-time PCR detection system. a fragment of 265 nucleotides was sequenced using a Roche 454 GS Junior sequencing platform. the fragment library was created for each sample according to the manufacturer's protocol. the sequence reads were trimmed at 30 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends to remove all primer sequences. each sample's Simpson index value was converted to a corresponding Hill number to derive its effective diversity. Hill's N2 allows a more intuitive comparison between communities. a community with N2 = 10 species is twice as diverse as one with N2 = 5) and is suitable for statistical analysis by basic linear regression methods. NL/09wt and NL/09var viruses were cultured in 9-to-11-day-old embryonated chicken's eggs incubated at 33\u00b0C. the NL/09-based viruses were passaged twice in MDCK cells following rescue. infectious virus titers were calculated from four replicates each of the homogenized tissue samples by the method of Reed and Muench. confluent MDCK cells were washed with PBS and then inoculated with 10-fold serial dilutions of ferret swab samples. four ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09wt virus and 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09var virus in a 40-l volume. four ferrets were inoculated intranasally with 1 105 TCID50 of pan/99 virus and 1 105 TCID50 of NL/09var virus in a 40-l volume. culated intranasally with 1 105 TCID50 of Pan/99var virus (20 l in each nostril) and intratracheally with 1 ml containing 105 TCID50 of Pan/99var virus intratracheally. ferrets were euthanized at day 3 (F14 and F15), at day 4 (F16), or at day 5 (F13) cDNA was used as the template in qPCRs with appropriate primers. qPCR and melt analyses were carried out in a CFX384 real-time PCR detection system. data were analyzed using Precision Melt Analysis software (Bio-Rad) the fragment library was created for each sample according to the manufacturer's protocol. sequence reads from the GS Junior sequencing data were trimmed at 30 nucleotides from the 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 ends to remove all primer sequences. a community with N2 = 10 species is twice as diverse as one with N2 = 5) and is suitable for statistical analysis by basic linear regression methods (58)."}
