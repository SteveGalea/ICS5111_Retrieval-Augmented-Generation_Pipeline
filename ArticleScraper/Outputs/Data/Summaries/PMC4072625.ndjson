{"summary": "herbal formula was first described in \u201cDan Xi Xin Fa\u201d by Zhu Danxi. YPFS exerts antiviral effects including influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus [1]\u2013[5], as well as curative effects in inflammation-associated diseases. YPFS suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines in a lipopolysaccharide-induced chronic inflammation model. YPFS stimulated the production of immunoglobulin after antigens were directly injected into the body. YPFS suppressed immunoglobulin production when external antigens were infused in the nasal mucus. a reduced expression of IALP in IBD patients was shown to be closely correlated with gut inflammation [21], [22]. in TCM clinics today, YPFS is widely used in treating IBD; however, the underlying mechanism of YPFS remains poorly understood. we chose 2 specific cellular models: macrophages and enterocytes. the maximum dose of all extracts could be at 3 mg/mL in the following experiments. YPFS inhibits LPS-induced enzyme expression Abnormal up regulation of iNOS and COX-2 is commonly involved in several inflammation-induced diseases. cultured macrophages were treated with herbal extracts for 3 hours. after which LPS (1 g/mL) was applied to the cultures for 24 hours to mimic chronic inflammation. expression level of iNOS protein was examined using western-blotting analysis. YPFS suppresses LPS-induced expression of COX-2 in cultured macrophages. treatment with SR led to 18% and 30% reductions in expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein. the levels of COX-2 mRNA were determined using RT-PCR and normalized relative to the GAPDH signal. the levels of COX-2 mRNA were determined using an antibody specific for COX-2. expression of IALP mRNA expression was induced. yPFS stimulates IALP expression and activity in Caco-2 cells. IALP activity in Caco-2 cells was measured by mixing samples with 5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate. treatment with YPFS induced iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner. this induced a 25-fold increase in IALP activity after 7 days of treatment. yPFS induces pro-inflammatory enzymes. cultured macrophages were treated with 1 mg/mL of the single herbal extracts and YPFS (inset) for 24 hours. expression of iNOS protein was determined using RT-PCR. yPFS treatment increased COX-2 mRNA and protein. expression in a dose-dependent manner, with maximum levels reaching 3 and 17 folds, respectively. in the case of treatment with single herbal extract, AR and SR increased COX-2 mRNA expression nearly 2 and 20 folds, respectively. iNOS expression partially blocked the induction of COX-2 expression in macrophages. results in (C) and (D) were calculated using the western blots shown in (B) values were normalized using the internal control GAPDH and are expressed as fold-increases relative to basal reading. mean SD are shown, n = 5, each with triplicate samples. regulation of iNOS and COX-2 is commonly involved in several inflammation-induced diseases, e.g. IBD. we determined the inhibitory effects of YPFS on expression of iNOS in cultured macrophages. when the cells were treated with YPFS for 3 hours before applying LPS, the expression of iNOS mRNA was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner. expression levels of mRNAs encoding iNOS were determined using real-time PCR (RT-PCR), performed with GAPDH serving as an internal control for normalization. the expression of iNOS protein was examined using western-blotting analysis. YPFS suppresses LPS-induced expression of COX-2 in cultured macrophages. treatment with AR and AMR extracts suppressed, relative to control, LPS-induced expression of COX-2 mRNA and protein by nearly 55%. YPFS stimulates IALP expression and activity in Caco-2 cells. yPFS stimulates IALP expression and activity in Caco-2 cells. IALP mRNA levels were quantified using RT-PCR. cells were harvested on various days as in (A) and extracts were prepared using a lysis buffer. IALP activity in Caco-2 cells was measured by mixing samples with 5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate. sodium butyrate served as the positive control. treatment with YPFS induced iNOS expression in a dose-dependent manner. effects were 2- and 40-fold of increase measured for mRNA and protein levels. SR robustly induced iNOS mRNA and protein expression, almost 40 and 350 folds. macrophages were treated with 1 mg/mL of the individual herbs (AR, AMR, and SR) for 24 hours after first incubating the cells for 3 hours with or without the NF-B-specific inhibitor BAY 11-7082 (5 M) results in (C) and (D) were calculated using the western blots shown in (B) the treatment with BAY 11-7082 partially blocked the induction of COX-2 expression. the herbal extracts used in this study might stimulate COX-2 expression through the NF-B signaling pathway. a systematic approach to study YPFS has been successfully developed using distinct methods based on chemical and biological assessments. systematic approaches were applied in this study on YPFS to uncover the underlying mechanism in cultures by which YPFS functions in clinical treatment of IBD. the gastrointestinal tract is the largest and most complex immune environment in the body. YPFS contains AR, AMR, and SR, and the activities of these 3 herbs have been reported. in macrophages, AR extracts stimulated the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, and TNF) whereas AR extracts or AR fraction can also suppress the expression of these pro-inflammatory cytokines. ursolic acid exhibits contrasting anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory bioactivities in vitro and in vivo [36]\u2013[40] effects that are similar to those of YPFS. studies on ursolic acid could offer valuable clues. the antibody against glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was obtained from Amersham Biosciences. penicillin, streptomycin, and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies were purchased from Invitrogen Technologies. raw 264.7 cells were cultured in 6-well plates at a density of 250,000 cells/well. cells lysates were then prepared and subjected to western-blotting analyses. 50,000 cells/well were cultured in 12-well plates and treated with herbal extracts. real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green Master mix and ROX reference dye according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the primers were 5\u2032- AAC GGA TTT GGC CGT ATT GG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- CTT CCC GTT CAG CTC TGG G-3\u2032 for human IALP (269 bp; NM_001631.3). gel electrophoresis and melting curve analysis were performed to confirm the specific amplification of PCR products. cells were collected in a low-salt lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES), 250 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 mM PMSF, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM Na3VO4, and 10 mg/mL each of aprotin dilutions used were 110,000 HRP-conjugated anti-mouse antibody to detect iNOS induction and suppression. 12,500 and 110,000 HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody to detect COX-2 induction and suppression. protein concentrations were determined in 96-well microtiter plates using a kit from Bio-Rad Laboratories (Hercules, CA) dilutions of BSA standard were used in the tests and samples were assayed in triplicate. raw materials were purchased from medicinal herbal markets. no special permissions were required for visiting the collection sites or conducting activities related to collecting the raw materials. 80,000 Raw 264.7 cells/well were cultured in 12-well plates and treated with reagents for 24 hours. cells lysates were then prepared and subjected to western-blotting analyses. we investigated the effects of herbal extracts on expression of the IALP gene. 5\u2032- GCC CTG CTT TGT CAG -3\u2032 and 5\u2032- GCA CCT GGA ACA GCA CTC TCT TG -3\u2032 for murine iNOS (254 bp; NM_010927.3); 5\u2032- GGT TGC TGG GGG AAG AAA TGT GCC -3\u2032 and 5\u2032- GAC GTT TTT ATT GG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032- CTT CCC GTT CAG CTC TGG the cell lysates were vortexed for 10 min and the insoluble cell debris were removed by centrifugation. the cells were boiled in a gel-loading buffer (20% glycerol, 10% -mercaptoethanol, 6% SDS, 125 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 6.8, 0.005% Bromophenol Blue; 15) at 95\u00b0C for 10 min. intestinal alkaline phosphatase assay Caco-2 cells (50,000/well) cultured in 12-well plates were treated with reagents every day starting 24 hours after plating. cells were harvested on days 1, 6, 11, 16, and 21.
