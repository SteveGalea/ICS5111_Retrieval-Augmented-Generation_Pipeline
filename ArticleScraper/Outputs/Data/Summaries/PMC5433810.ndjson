{"summary": "Efforts to combat HIV, tuberculosis and malaria in sub-saharan africa in the past decade have underscored the inadequacy of laboratory systems in most African countries. laboratory testing is required for the diagnosis and management of these diseases and many other communicable and non-communicable diseases endemic to the region. the Polio Laboratory Network in africa has played a critical role in diagnosing poliovirus disease (poliomyelitis) and the detection of poliovirus transmission. many countries in africa have been declared free of polio. in west africa, there is a great need for a gap analysis assessment of current laboratory systems in africa. a laboratory network assessment tool, the LABNET scorecard, was developed to assist countries in assessing the development of their networks. the global health security agenda was launched in February 2014 by a group of nations working collaboratively to promote global health security as an international priority. five-year target is real-time biosurveillance with a national laboratory system. it is expected that the laboratory system will reliably conduct testing on at least five of the 10 core tests on specimens transported to accredited laboratories from at least 80% of the districts in the country. there is a need to establish functional national laboratory networks for various reasons. each country must develop its own plan as it will be unique to its existing medical, laboratory and regulatory structure. as part of strategic planning, leadership will determine priorities for strengthening the national laboratory network system and develop a vision, goals, objectives, expected results and strategies for the next three to five years to achieve the desired results. budget should be adequate to cover capital and operating expenses of the laboratory network. national laboratory standards are developed that apply to all laboratories operating in the country. national laboratory standards are developed that apply to all laboratories operating in the country. the test menu available at each level of a tiered national laboratory network would depend on infrastructure available and testing needs for patients. the number of tiers in the laboratory system and the test menu performed at each level may vary depending on service level needs, priority diseases, geographic coverage, referral capabilities. coccus Antigen and/or India Ink GeneXpert Rapid TB testing Gram Stain and Primary Culture Type and Cross-match Urine pregnancy test Wet mounts Viral Load

EQA HIV Malaria Haematology Microbiology Chemistry CD medical and public health laboratory services are a critical component of national health systems and are central to disease diagnosis, treatment, prevention, surveillance and outbreak investigations. in africa, laboratory testing influences medical decision making in nearly half of the cases presenting to primary healthcare facilities. the first objective is that the quality of health services should be good enough to improve the health of those receiving services. the third objective is that people should be protected against financial risk. countries must define how a primary healthcare laboratory package should be formulated to contribute to universal health coverage in africa. the working group would suggest which testing can be performed in the tiered network within the country and which testing must be sent to sub-regional, regional or global reference laboratories. the group would also ensure the contribution of laboratory services to universal health coverage at all levels of the national health system. network must be integrated with surveillance and public health activities of the country. the network must be fully integrated into public health outbreak response protocols and surge capacity must be available. current laboratories must be assessed for the adequacy of their physical infrastructure. supply chain management systems must exist at the central procurement and laboratory facility levels. the director in the division of Laboratories must actively collaborate with and inform procurement and central medical stores, so that laboratory needs are met. supply consumption and forecasting systems must be developed. equipment management plan should be developed that lists equipment required for each tier of the laboratory network. equipment should be harmonised and appropriate for the complexity of the laboratory at each tier in order to reduce the training, maintenance, and supply chain burdens for the country. standard operating procedures should be developed by the quality unit at the central level for all laboratories in the network. standard documents can serve as templates for all laboratories and be modified to meet the needs of individual laboratories. a document control system must be in place for all laboratory documents. a plan for accreditation of laboratories within the network should exist. national reference laboratories should try to achieve international accreditation. a timeline and roadmap for accreditation activities would be developed by the quality unit. Laboratories require adequate computer systems, internet access, and other electronic devices to transmit reports and data within the country. a hospital information system with a laboratory component may be desirable to transmit laboratory orders and results electronically. the ability to meet patient care needs, integrated disease surveillance needs and laboratory testing/reporting with one health sector computer system will be most efficient and cost-effective. biosafety guidelines should be developed to establish safe work practices and containment levels for all laboratories. biosafety guidelines should address all aspects of safety in the laboratory, including personal protective equipment, engineering controls, phlebotomy safety, sharps precautions, post-exposure prophylaxis. an initial risk assessment would be performed by laboratory management and scientific staff to determine the level of biosecurity measures needed based on the country\u2019s needs. a distinction must be made between specimens and materials that require additional biosecurity measures and those that will be tested on a one-time basis, stored briefly then destroyed by the laboratory. national laboratory network laboratories should be able to conduct testing to support integrated disease surveillance for at least 10 priority infectious diseases. this requires an integrated, tiered laboratory network with modern diagnostic capabilities and real-time surveillance capabilities. laboratory-based surveillance must be fully implemented with a national reporting system for antimicrobial resistance. each country must develop its own plan as it will be unique to its existing medical, laboratory and regulatory structure. as part of strategic planning, leadership will determine priorities for strengthening the national laboratory network system and develop a vision, goals, objectives, expected results and strategies for the next three to five years. all activities in the implementation plan for the first three years, at a minimum. budget should be adequate to cover capital and operating expenses of the laboratory network. national laboratory standards are developed that apply to all laboratories operating in the country, including public, private, and mission-based laboratories. testing would be referred up the pyramid of laboratories with communications going up and down. the number of tiers in the laboratory system and the test menu performed at each level may vary depending on service level needs, priority diseases, geographic coverage, referral capabilities, and resources available. ine CSF/Body Fluid and urine microscopy Cryptococcus Antigen and/or India Ink GeneXpert Rapid TB testing Gram Stain and Primary Culture Type and Cross-match Urine pregnancy test Wet mounts Viral Load (Point of care) All tests listed in for Levels 1 and 2 In addition: Complete Chemistry Panel Microbiology Culture, full ID and AST Hepatitis B and C Antibody National Health Laboratory (Tier 4) All tests listed in for Levels globin Meter RDTs (Malaria, HIV, Ebola, Syphilis...)
