{"summary": "paediatric anaesthesiologists need to develop protocols and guidelines to manage the perioperative blood loss. a complete blood count must be done in infants 12 months of age to evaluate Hb levels, haematocrit (Hct) and the reticulocyte count. normal values for haemoglobin concentration and MCV in infancy and childhood will vary according to age, Hgb level and other factors. infants of more than 4 months of age require red blood cells transfusion if Hgb 12 g/dl in first 24 h of life Hct is20% with symptoms of anaemia with low reticulocyte count Hct. intraoperative monitoring and management Need for intraoperative transfusion will depend on rapidity and amount of blood loss, assessment of patient's blood volume, pre-operative haematocrit, general medical condition including presence of cardiac/lung disease. Adequate and appropriate replacement of blood losses is essential to reduce mortality and morbidity in paediatric surgical patient. the volume of blood to be transfused must be estimated to achieve the target haematocrit. an average of 1 ml/kg of packed RBCs increase the haematocrit by upto 1.5%. tests to evaluate coagulation should be performed when major surgery is contemplated. normal values for haemoglobin concentration and MCV in infancy and childhood. intraoperative monitoring and management Need for intraoperative transfusion will depend on rapidity and amount of blood loss, assessment of patient's blood volume, pre-operative haematocrit, general medical condition including presence of cardiac/lung disease. Adequate and appropriate replacement of blood losses is essential to reduce mortality and morbidity in paediatric surgical patient. the volume of blood to be transfused must be estimated to achieve the target haematocrit. an average of 1 ml/kg of packed RBCs increase the haematocrit by upto 1.5%. fresh frozen plama Fresh frozen plasma may be used in cases of coagulation factor deficiency. the recommended dose is 1-2 units/10 kg or 10-15 ml/kg. the recommended dose is 1 unit/10 kg or 10-15 ml/kg. fresh frozen plama Fresh frozen plasma may be used in cases of coagulation factor deficiency. the recommended dose of FFP is 1 unit/10 kg or 10-15 ml/kg. it may alternate with equal volumes of packed RBCs. the degree of hypocalcaemia depends on the rate of transfusion and the state of liver function. this is more with administration of FFP since it exhibits a higher concentration of citrates per unit of volume. this depends on the rate of transfusion and the state of liver function. ide 20 mg/kg or calcium gluconate 60 mg/kg may be used to treat hyperkalaemia causing arrhythmias. use of intravenous dextrose insulin, hyperventilation and sympathomimetics can be useful. aemia depends on the rate of transfusion and the state of liver function. this is more with administration of FFP since it exhibits a higher concentration of citrates per unit of volume. neonates are particularly vulnerable to deleterious effects of hypocalcaemia. halogenated anaesthetics administered can prevent hypocalcaemia. hypomagnesaemia due to rapid blood transfusion can result in ventricular tachycardia or fibrillation. calcium treatment is ineffective but responds to management with IV magnesium sulphate administered at 25-50 mg/kg. antithrombolysis Tranexamic acid has been found to be as effective as aprotinin in reducing perioperative bleeding after major paediatric surgery. the recommended dose of tranexamic acid as bolus is 20 mg/kg IV bolus followed by an infusion at 10 mg/kg/h. desmopressin is effective for up to 10 h after an IV injection in keeping the serum levels of factor VIII and VWF elevated. prothrombin complex contains factor II, VII, IX and X as well as anticoagulant factors. it can be used in the management of perioperative bleeding refractory to FFP, platelets and cryoprecipitate. the recommended dose of prothombin complex is 20-30 IU/kg. fibrinogen concentrate may be used in doses of 30-50 mg/kg in bleeding diathesis in cases of congenital or acquired hypofibrinogenaemia. prothrombin complex contains factor II, VII, IX and X as well as anticoagulant factors viz., protein S, protien C and traces of heparin. pre-operative autologous transfusion, acute normovolaemic haemodilution circulatory manipulations have been tried in paediatric cardiac surgery, liver transplantation, craniosynostosis and scoliosis."}
