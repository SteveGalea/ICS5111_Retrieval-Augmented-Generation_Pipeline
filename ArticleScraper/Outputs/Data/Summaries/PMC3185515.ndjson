{"summary": "HCoV-NL63 was identified in 2004 in a child with bronchiolitis in the Netherlands. worldwide screenings revealed that the virus can be detected across the globe in children and adults with respiratory tract infections [2\u20138] the chance to develop larynchotracheabronchitis (croup) is high. a sudden rise in coronavirus antibody titers is a strong indication for a coronavirus infection. we have shown this for children who acquire their first HCoV-NL63 infection during their first years of life. at later ages repeated infections with human coronaviruses can occur [14] depending on the levels of protective antibodies. NL63-protein on the ELISA plate suggests antibodies are directed to an HCoV-NL63-like virus. on the X-axis, the antibodies are directed to an HCoV-NL63 virus. longitudinal serum samples were available of three rhesus macaques with the highest antibody levels to HCoV-NL63 (numbers 5, 10 and 17) these monkeys had been sampled on a regular basis, with on average one serum sample every one or two years. in all three animals a sudden rise in antibody titers was noticed. a second rise occurred after the winter of 2006/2007. the animals were all checked for antibodies to HCoV-229E. for none of the three monkeys reactivity was detected. this is in accordance with the first screening of the animals. the images represent the cell nucleus (blue) and rhesus macaque antibodies (green) signals. one can conclude that it was infections with HCoV-NL63. it can never be excluded that there is a coronavirus infecting these rhesus monkeys that is closely related to HCoV-NL63. rhesus macaques have been infected with HCoV-NL63. it is not necessary to sacrifice monkeys by experimental infecting. a well-designed follow up with serum and respiratory samples would be sufficient to unravel the potential of the human respiratory viruses. isolated but remained in a breeding colony and were not used for immunization with antigens or adjuvant, or any other study. all serum specimens were stored at 80\u00b0C and heat-inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes prior to analysis. the proteins were diluted in 0.1 M carbonate buffer pH 9.6. unspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS + 0.1% Tween20 (PBST) supplemented with 5% skim milk. after washing, alkaline Phosphatase conjugated anti-monkey antibody (Sigma Aldrich) diluted (1:40,000) in 1% skim milk PBST was added. 12well plates at a density of 0.32 106 cells / well and cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium. cells were infected with HCoV-NL63 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.007 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. cells were fixed with 3.7% PFA in PBS for 30 minutes at room temperature. the recombinant HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E recombinant carboxyl-terminal nucleocapsid proteins were either imported or born in the Netherlands. the animals have not been isolated but remained in a breeding colony. ELISA ninety-six-well plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 3 g/ml of expressed recombinant N protein of HCoV-NL63 or HCoV-229E. unspecific binding sites were blocked with PBS + 0.1% Tween20 (PBST) supplemented with 5% skim milk (Fluka) for one hour at room temperature. cells were seeded on coverslips in 12-well plates at a density of 0.32 106 cells / well and cultured at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 in minimal essential medium. cells were infected with HCoV-NL63 at a multiplicity of infection of 0.007 and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. no animal model system has been described for HCoV-NL63. there are clear signs that Rhesus macaques acquire natural infections with HCoV-NL63, or a serologically very closely related coronavirus."}
