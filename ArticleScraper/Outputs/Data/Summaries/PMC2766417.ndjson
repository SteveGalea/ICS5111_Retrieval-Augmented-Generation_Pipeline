{"summary": "despite recent research supporting the use of metered dose inhalers with spacer devices (MDI/spacers) in pediatric emergency departments, uptake of this practice has been slow. the aim of this study was to determine the barriers and supports to implementing MDI/spacer research and to identify factors associated with early and late adoption of MDI/spacers. there are two main methods of delivering bronchodilators to children in the ED. the evidence has been well established that MDI/spacers are as effective (and in many ways superior) to nebulisers for mild to moderate asthma treatment in the ED. a comparative case study design was used within the EDs of nine Canadian pediatric tertiary-care teaching hospitals. the EDs were classified into one of three categories based on stage of MDI/spacer implementation: 'early adopters,' 'adopting,' and those 'yet to adopt' participants included all PED physicians, ED registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and medical and nursing directors in each of the departments. an information letter outlining the details of the study was sent to the PERC-affiliated research nurse or physician in each site. participants were assured their responses would remain confidential and anonymous. a court reporter, an individual trained in verbatim recording of the spoken word, was used to record the individual interviews. both electronic and print copies of the transcribed interviews were produced. all interview transcripts were checked for accuracy and completeness using line-by-line comparison between audio recordings and written transcripts. a comparative case study design was used within the EDs of nine Canadian pediatric tertiary-care teaching hospitals. the phenomenon of interest was the adoption of MDI/spacers for the treatment of asthma, and the unit of analysis was the individual PEDs. the EDs were classified into one of three categories based on stage of MDI/spacer implementation: 'early adopters,' 'adopting,' and those 'yet to adopt' participants included all PED physicians, ED registered nurses, respiratory therapists, and medical and nursing directors in each of the departments. an information letter outlining the details of the study was sent to the PERC-affiliated research nurse or physician in each site. interview participants were assured their responses would remain confidential and anonymous. a court reporter, an individual trained in verbatim recording of the spoken word, was used to record the individual interviews. a digital recording device was used to record the individual interviews, which were later transcribed. all interview transcripts were checked for accuracy and completeness using line-by-line comparison between audio recordings and written transcripts. results There were nine tertiary level pediatric EDs comprising 150 participants. three sites were already routinely using MDI/spacers in the ED. two sites were in the adoption process, and the remaining four sites had not yet adopted the innovation. the site-specific barriers and facilitators identified by participants are summarized in Table 2.

'adoption' of MDI/spacers is actually an institutional or department decision. participants at non-adopting sites expressed positive attitudes towards research. participants at non-adopting sites expressed positive attitudes towards research. staff shortages and the 'downloading' of tasks previously performed in inpatient units contributed to a busy environment in the ED where there were many competing priorities. staff shortages and the 'downloading' of tasks that were previously performed in inpatient units contributed to a busy environment. participants in adopter sites perceived that the presence of a professional (or professionals) within the department willing to champion the practice change was one of the most significant factors influencing in the adoption of the MDI/spacer. participants in adopter sites perceived that the presence of a professional (or professionals) within the department willing to champion the practice change was one of the most significant factors influencing in the adoption of the practice. participants from early adopting sites acknowledged that parents were sceptical about the use of a treatment they had already used at home and had presumably 'not worked' parents associated the use of the nebuliser with the administration of oxygen, and consequently doubted that any treatment without oxygen would be helpful. early adopting sites identified the same barriers and supports to MDI/spacer adoption. lack of consensus among staff and lack of a research champion were the biggest barriers to adoption in late adopting sites. staff attended organized educational sessions, educational materials were prepared for patients and their families. participants believed there were other priorities within the department that were more deserving of a portion of the limited available resources. sites that had successfully adopted the MDI/spacer were able to recognize the unique characteristics of the innovation, adopters, and practice environment at their particular ED and successfully use these attributes to facilitate adoption. x x Practice Environment Language barrier (parents) x x x x Concerns about overtreatment at

x x x x x participants in only one (early adopter) site thought both treatment modalities took approximately the same amount of time, citing that the shorter time required for preparation and administration of the MDI/spacer made up for the time spent doing patient education. many participants from the yet to adopt sites felt that using MDI/spacers were 'as good as if not better' than using nebulisation. clinicians from the sites participating in this study exhibited a range of knowledge, attitudes, and skills regarding the MDI/spacer. the majority of participants were aware of the results of research concerning the effectiveness of MDI/spacers, with physicians and respiratory therapists in general being more knowledgeable than nurses. respiratory therapists were considered a valuable resource in the five locations where they were permanent members of the ED team. only two of the sites that either had adopted or were adopting MDI/spacer use did so without any RT support. similarities among the sites were also found. sites where the MDI/spacer was part of a written guideline were used more often and more consistently, with the exception of the one where physicians were able to choose between nebulisers and MDI/spacers on the asthma guideline. participants expressed frustration at the amount of time and energy required to make modifications in clinical practice (policy changes) early adopting sites expected parents to initially be resistant to the use of MDI/spacers in the ED. parents and children who were frequent ED visitors were perceived to be the most fervent in their resistance. participants from early adopting sites acknowledged parents were sceptical about the use of a treatment they had already used at home and had presumably 'not worked' early adopter/adopting sites perceived an increase in patient empowerment and confidence. the severity of a patient's asthma had a bearing on which method of treatment was used with'mild' and'moderate' patients receiving medication via MDI/spacer, and'severe' patients receiving nebulisation. staff at one early adopter site were convinced that MDI/spacer administration actually took less time than nebulisation. the final major barrier to MDI/spacer adoption was cost. some participants argued that 'doubling up' on equipment would be wasteful. early adopter sites reported having many of the same barriers that sites that had yet to adopt the innovation had. identified barriers and facilitators related to: attributes of the innovation (MDI/spacer), such as perceived ease of use, clear advantages of MDI/spacers and cost. attributes of the individual clinicians working within the EDs including elements such as entrenched ideas and scepticism. adopting MDI/spacers is a multi-level institution or department decision. clarity over who is going to bear the cost of the MDI/spacer and harnessing the support of leadership and a champion were critical forces in garnering adoption. findings complement the work of Osmond and colleagues [6] who surveyed Canadian multidisciplinary ED healthcare professionals. early adopter sites shared some of the barriers to MDI/spacer adoption. but early adopter sites created/generated support and leadership to overcome the barriers. authors must be mindful of individual perspectives acquired. participants in sites where adoption had taken place may have unintentionally justified their present practice by 'glossing over' the main barriers they had experienced in the past. however, through focus groups, we believe that this limitation is minimized through the garnering of multiple perspectives on the process. despite strong research evidence that MDI/spacer can produce results equivalent to nebulisers, adoption of MDI/spacers for the treatment of mild and moderate asthma has been slow. despite strong research evidence that MDI/spacer can produce results equivalent to nebulisers, adoption of MDI/spacer has been slow. study demonstrates the value of assessing the unit-specific barriers and facilitators prior to planned implementation change initiatives. authors declare that they have no competing interests. children's
