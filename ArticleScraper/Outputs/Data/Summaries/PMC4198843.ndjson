{"summary": "the specialty of CLP was initially launched in the united states and adopted worldwide, but its development in China has not been a smooth one. the concept of CLP has become more widely accepted by medical professionals and administrators. clinical services include the provision of psychiatric consultations for non-psychiatric medical staff and promotion of the psychosocial perspective of care. research component includes training basic psychiatric concepts and the psychosocial perspective of care to medical students, residents and other care providers in non-psychiatric departments. despite the increased CLP presence, a large proportion of general hospitals in the country still lack psychiatric support so they make neurologists responsible for psychological problems. psychiatrists from specialty hospitals are only called in if it proves impossible to control a patient's behavior. the psychiatric hospitals were subscribing to a median of four academic journals. 19% had no residency training program and those that did have a training program lacked a uniform method and curriculum for training clinical psychiatrists. this shows the poor overall status of psychiatric services and training in the country. the limited CLP services available at the hospitals with departments of psychiatry are single case-based consultations. there are no full-time CLP psychiatrists who regularly participate in routine clinical care in non-psychiatric departments. only 22.4% of the general hospitals in Wuhan offered mental health services (77% of which were high-level tertiary hospitals) only 15.4% of the staff at these outpatient mental health departments were trained psychiatrists (48.7% were other physicians and 25.6% had degrees in psychology).

consultation rates (ranging from 0.02 to 3.6%) and only 14 of the studies reported the diagnostic criteria used to make the diagnosis. organic mental disorder was the most frequent reason for consultation, accounting for 24 to 87% of all referrals. the department of psychosomatic medicine at the university of Freiburg, Germany, and the department of psychiatry at Tongji Hospital in Shanghai launched a national continuing medical education project. a subsequent collaborative \u2018Asia-Link\u2019 project between the University of Freiburg, tongji University and other institutions in Australia, Vietnam, and Laos enabled Asian psychiatrists and other physicians to receive training in the basic skills of psychosomatic medicine. the quality of life of internal medicine outpatients is closely associated with the severity and duration of concurrent anxiety and depressive symptoms. despite a relatively large number of mental health studies related to transplants conducted in recent years, the quality of most such studies is quite low. post-disaster mental health intervention offered by psychiatrists to families of the victims in the 2002 \u2018Northern Airlines Crash\u2019 was the first post-disaster mental health intervention in china. during the wenchuan earthquake in 2008, there was a surge of research relating to CLP services. general hospitals are usually cautious in their use of psychotropic drugs, preferring to have them administered by psychiatrists. all the main psychiatric medications are available in general hospitals but are typically used at lower doses than in specialty psychiatric settings. the prevalence of depression and dysthymia was 4.0% and 0.6%. other less common conditions included neurasthenia, generalized anxiety, somatoform disorders, alcohol dependence, depressive neurosis, panic disorders and phobic disorders. the psychiatric consultation rate was very low, the highest reported rate in general medical wards was 1.78%. there was no genuine consultation between psychiatrists, non-psychiatric clinicians and patients. there was no research about developing an appropriate China-specific model of CLP. mental health clinicians at general hospitals should be composed of psychiatrists (with 5-year medical degrees) and well-trained psychotherapists, and their numbers should increase from the current 100 individuals to at least 1000 individuals. the results for the 20 articles identified[12]\u2013[31] are shown in Table 1. the results for the 20 articles identified[12]\u2013[31] are shown in Table 1.

increase in the adoption of psychiatric theories and practices by other departments. \u2018Psycho-cardiology Medicine\u2019 Cardiovascular expert Professor Dayi Hu proposed the concept of \u2018Psycho-cardiology Medicine\u2019 [36] in 2006. this approach integrates an understanding of the many biomedical risk factors for heart disease with an understanding of the psychological characteristics that are needed for individuals to effectively reduce their risk of heart disease. studies on the psychological status of patients following treatment for malignant tumors suffer from the same limitations. however, studies on the psychological status of patients following treatment for malignant tumors suffer from the same limitations. a well-designed study on nursing of patients with malignant tumors has been conducted by a psychiatrist. atric intervention and medical treatment in general hospitals differs from mainstream psychiatry in several ways. in most psychiatric services the patient presents himself or herself to the psychiatrist for management of a perceived psychiatric problem whereas in CLP the psychiatrist approaches the patient. a simplified version of the guidelines for the treatment of anxiety disorders is also available. the Consensus of Experts on the Diagnosis and Treatment of Nervous System Disease Associated with Depression and Anxiety Disorders[54] and the Consensus Expert Panel on the Definition, Diagnosis and Drug Treatment of Insomnia[56] are suitable for use by clinicians in general hospitals. a recent volume entitled

LP in other countries is based on the accumulated experience of the last two decades and the continuing support of the government it will ultimately grow and prosper. Chinese CLP physicians are, asposited by Lipowski, part of the small number of health care professionals in the country."}
