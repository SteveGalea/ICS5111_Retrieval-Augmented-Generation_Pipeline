{"summary": "the protocol was rapidly and effectively instituted by teamwork training. phase 1 was a curriculum design of a SARS-specific cardiac arrest protocol. a single person can do a PPS worn for the patient in 1 1/2 minutes. a case report suggested that intubation of patients produced a high risk for transmission of SARS to healthcare workers (HCWs). the lack of literature, uncertainty about treatment, and fear of the disease caused great concern among HCWs. modified protocol was designed and referred to as 'Code Blue Special' (CBS) the critical care department convened committee meetings involving experts representing the disciplines involved in the treatment of cardiac arrest (anesthesia, cardiology, critical care, emergency medicine, nursing, and respiratory therapy) the maximum number of HCWs for each session was eight. the group then observed two educators describing and demonstrating the dress-up and dress-down method for the PPS. subsequent simulations involved only basic cardiopulmonary resuscitation and intubation because hospital policy mandates defibrillation by physicians only. a modified ACLS protocol was designed and referred to as 'Code Blue Special' the goal of Phase 2 was to train the on-call cardiac arrest teams in CBS. we acquired a dedicated training area in the hospital consisting of five adjoining rooms with computer and internet access. the team members were on call during the next two days. six anesthesia residents, six medical residents and six medical residents were trained. the rest of the group managed a different simulation. the group was chosen to mimic the arrest team. there was no evidence that the person defibrillating needed to don a PPS. we changed the protocol so that any physician on the ward could defibrillate, even if not part of the arrest team. there was uncertainty about the mode of transmission of the SARS virus. a portable end-tidal CO2 detector was used as the initial method to confirm tracheobronchial placement of the endotracheal tube. a second person was allowed to place the stethoscope earpieces under direct vision. we noted ergonomic limitations when wearing the PPS. education and infection control team simulated every step of the dressing and undressing to ensure safety and clarity. they then scripted and photographed the process. ward nurses were trained as dressing assistants. teachers checked individual and team performances of trainees in the cardiac arrest protocol, as well as the infection control policy. mistakes in infection control practice by HCWs were noted and corrected. removing the PPS always posed a great danger of self-contamination. the cart was easily portable and allowed four HCWs to access it simultaneously. it also had numbered equipment labels allowing HCWs to follow the dress-up procedure visually without memorizing the steps. there was concern about the delay to defibrillation. multifunction defibrillation electrodes capable of both pacing and defibrillation were applied to the chest. the machine could be placed about 2 m from the patient when multifunction electrodes were used. the buttons on the machine could be pressed for defibrillation. s to the virus, patients received a neuromuscular blocker before intubation. in situ intravenous access was added to the protocol to expedite drug delivery. no drugs were permitted via the endotracheal tube. the first protocol required a PPS for everyone entering the patient's room as part of the arrest team. it took between 3 1/2 and 5 1/2 minutes for the fastest team member to dress, even with assistants aiding verbally and physically. this time seemed to be due to HCWs and assistants talking at the same time to request equipment, and reaching across each other for equipment. available resources did not permit a defibrillator in each room. the defibrillator machine could be placed about 2 m from the patient. there was uncertainty about the mode of transmission of the SARS virus. ACLS modifications Positive-pressure ventilation was permitted only by HCWs wearing the PPS. patients received a neuromuscular blocker before intubation. no drugs were permitted via the endotracheal tube. training sessions were held on Monday to Friday. the largest group to train was the 225 ICU nurses. the program was evaluated by the trainees. mistakes in infection control practice by HCWs were noted and corrected. removing the PPS always posed a great danger of self-contamination. there were no known instances of self-contamination of HCWs in our institution. the need for educators to have dedicated time freed from regular duties. the need for night training sessions for staff who work only night shifts. the limited time available to HCWs to attend the teaching sessions precluded this. high-fidelity simulations of infectious disease protocols can be an invaluable asset for staff and patient safety. a written protocol can be developed and simulated, and core groups of people can be trained in the protocol before the crisis occurs.
