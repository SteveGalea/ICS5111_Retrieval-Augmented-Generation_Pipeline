{"summary": "sensitivity of fever for detecting H1N1-2009 cases was estimated to be 22.2% (95% confidence interval: 0, 55.6) among nine confirmed H1N1-2009 cases. 55.6% of the H1N1-2009 cases were under antipyretic medications upon arrival. entry screening measures at international airports and other border control measures during the early stages of the 2009 pandemic. many countries adopted entry screening measures to some extent during the early stages of the 2009 pandemic. entry screening tends to start with a search for febrile international passengers, and such fever screening tends to start with a search for febrile international passengers. infrared thermoscanners are used to monitor and screen for febrile passengers. despite high diagnostic accuracy and NPV, the readings of infrared thermoscanners are known to be influenced by several confounding factors. the validity of fever screening in relation to its theoretical rationale should be assessed in practical settings. 87,000 international flights per year (i.e. 240 flights per day) through which approximately 18 million passengers per year enter Japan (i.e. 40,000-50,000 passengers per day) the first dataset contained the limited number of confirmed cases infected with H1N1-2009 or other influenza viruses whose diagnosis took place at the airport during the early stages of the 2009 pandemic. the second dataset contained non-randomly sampled passengers. a total of 1,903 commercial aircrafts landed at Narita International Airport from the three countries. a total of 805 persons underwent rapid diagnostic testing, and 15 tested positive. a total of 18 cases were confirmed as having influenza. a total of eight TVS-500 infrared thermoscanners were placed near the quarantine station. the infrared sensors optically scanned the surface of each passenger. the temperature distributions were recorded as two-dimensional thermal images. these subjects were selected based on the above-mentioned criteria. the axillary temperature of the subjects was measured once using a thermistor. the temperature was displayed at approximately 90 seconds after the insertion. the temperature was displayed at approximately 90 seconds after the insertion. among 1,049 screened passengers, we measured associations of hyperthermia with age, gender, place of embarkation, age, gender and history of medications. we also measured the associations of hyperthermia with age, gender, place of embarkation, self-reporting (dichotomous) and satellite of measurement. UC used logit transformation using logit transformation of the AUC [26]. a demographic variable appeared to be a potential confounding factor of hyperthermia (i.e. age) we also measured the above-mentioned diagnostic performances of the thermoscanners in identifying fever among the sample. a total of 1,903 commercial aircrafts landed at Narita international airport. a total of 18 cases were confirmed as having influenza. a total of 9 cases with H1N1-2009 and 7 cases with other influenza viruses were evaluated. a total of 9,140,435 passengers arrived at Narita International Airport from 1 September 2009 to 31 January 2010. a total of 9,140,435 passengers were screened by infrared thermoscanners. a total of eight TVS-500 infrared thermoscanners were placed near the quarantine station. the airport has two discrete terminals. a total of four infrared thermoscanners were placed in each terminal. terminal 2 is mostly used by alliance A, while terminal 1 is roughly divided into two groups. we calculated the exact 95% confidence interval (CI) of the sensitivity. we also examined the associations of hyperthermia with age, gender, place of embarkation. among the 1,049 screened passengers, we measured the associations of hyperthermia with age, gender, place of embarkation. sensitivity and specificity were computed using normal approximation to the binomial distribution. the calculations of the 95% CIs of the PPV and NPV were based on the Wald method with the PPV and NPV variances determined by the delta method [25]. for calculation of the 95% CI of the AUC, we employed the Wald method using logit transformation of the AUC [26]. males accounted for 9 cases (56.3%), and gender was not significantly associated with H1N1-2009 (p = 0.13) a total of 13 cases (81.3%) were under medications upon arrival. five of the 9 cases (55.6%) had taken commercially available cold/cough medications containing antipyretic substances. one child case among the remaining four cases took an antibiotic (azithromycin) prior to arrival. the sensitivities of fever for detecting influenza were 16.7% (95% CI: 3.0, 56.4) and 33.3% (95% CI: 6.1, 79.2) among those with and without medications. age and gender were not significantly associated with the proportion of hyperthermia cases. ages were 30.3 (18.5) and 29 (20-42) years respectively. males accounted for 653 persons (62.7%). ages were 30.3 (18.5) and 29 (20-42) years respectively. \u00b0C, 38.0\u00b0C and 38.5\u00b0C were 51.9% (95% CI: 48.8, 54.9), 37.0% (95% CI: 34.1, 40.0) and 23.5% (95% CI: 21.1, 26.2) no confirmatory diagnoses of H1N1-2009 were made among the total screened passengers. satellite was associated with the proportion of hyperthermia (p 0.01 for all cut-off levels) but the significant association disappeared after adjustment for age using a multiple logistic regression. a comparison of the axillary temperatures and the surface temperatures measured by the infrared thermoscanners was estimated to be 0.44 (p 0.01). the age-adjusted AUC ranged from 74.0-75.9%. the adjusted coefficients of determination, R2, were estimated to be 0.196 and 0.296 for the data shown in (A) and (C), respectively. negative predictive value 68.0 (64.7, 71.3) 61.9 (57.5, 66.4) 37.3 (34.5, 40.2) Negative predictive value 61.1 (58.3, 63.8) 73.9 (71.8, 75.9) 87.5 (85.3, 89.7) AUCunadj 70.5 (67.7, 73.2) 72.4 (69.6, 75.0) 73.1 (70.4, 75.7) AUCadj 74.0 (71.3, 76.6) 75.2 (72.4, values in parentheses are the 95% confidence intervals. we also measured the diagnostic performances of the infrared thermoscanners in correctly detecting fever among only the self-reporting passengers. sensitivity and PPV were also higher than those of the total screened subjects. the axillary temperature of the cases with the other influenza viruses ranged from 36.6-38.5\u00b0C with a mean (SD) of 37.2\u00b0C (1.5\u00b0C) the sensitivities of hyperthermia for detecting influenza were estimated to be 22.2% (95% CI: 0, 56.0) for H1N1-2009 and 42.9% (95% CI: 14.3, 85.7) for the other influenza viruses. the proportion of hyperthermia cases was smaller among those with medications for the cut-off levels of 37.5\u00b0C and 38.0\u00b0C. the sensitivities of fever for detecting influenza were 16.7% (95% CI: 3.0, 56.4) and 33.3% (95% CI: 6.1, 79.2) among those with and without medications (including antibiotics), respectively. 285 people (27.2%) self-reported some symptoms. 930 persons (88.7%) were detected by an infrared thermoscanner. 185 people were self-reported by an infrared thermoscanner. 28 people were diagnosed with malaria, 30 and 15 were diagnosed with dengue virus infection and chikungunya virus infection. the axillary temperature tended to be higher among younger passengers. there was no gender-specificity in the proportion of hyperthermia for the cut-off levels. the Pearson's correlation coefficient was estimated to be 0.44 (p 0.01). Using the three cut-off levels for hyperthermia, the surface temperatures measured by the infrared thermoscanners were significantly higher. the sensitivities were estimated to be 58.3%, 50.8% and 70.4%. the PPV and NPV ranged from 37.3-68.0% and 61.1-87.5%, respectively. the straight line represents a fitted line by means of a least squares regression. the adjusted coefficients of determination, R2, were estimated to be 0.196 and 0.296 for the data shown in (A) and (C), respectively. panels A and B show the data for all the screened passengers (n = 1,049), while panels C and D show the data for self-reporting passengers only (n = 285) 72.4 (69.6, 75.0) 73.1 (70.4, 75.7) AUCadj 74.0 (71.3, 76.6) 75.2 (72.4, 77.7) 75.9 (73.2, 78.4) Self-reporting (n = 285) Positive fraction 46.3 (43.3, 49.3) 46.3 (43.3, 49.3) 21.4 (18.9, 23.9) Sensitivity 75.8 (68.4, 83.1) 81.1 (74.4, 87.7) 73.8 the estimated sensitivity and PPV were also higher than those of the total screened subjects. the specificity and NPV were only partially significantly different compared with those for the total screened passengers. the expected AUC values were as low as 79.5-82.9%. sensitivity and AUC for the cut-off level of 38.0\u00b0C in the present study were as low as 50.8% and 72.4%, respectively. the actual PPV will be as low as 37.3-68.0%, implying more false-positive passengers during mass screening if one relies on infrared thermoscanners. the proportion of febrile cases among confirmed H1N1-2009 cases was reported to be 94% in the united states [34] no direct comparison can strictly be made because the fraction of febrile cases at an international border is different from that among a total number of confirmed cases in a community. but that figure of 94% and 22.2% obtained in our study indicate that the antipyretic medications taken by our study participants potentially reduced the risk of fever by 76.4%. infrared thermoscanners improve the detection of fever. they are especially useful in settings where the PPV and NPV do not matter. our estimates of the diagnostic performances must be interpreted with caution. the readings of infrared thermoscanners are known to be influenced by other confounding factors, most notably by age and outdoor temperature. age was shown to be a confounding factor, even among the suspected fraction of passengers. there are two plausible explanations for these findings: physiological reasons including age-dependent vascular reactivity. infrared thermoscanners are non-invasive and may detect a small portion of febrile influenza cases among the total passengers. the PPV of the infrared thermoscanners for detecting fever was shown to be insufficient to actively detect febrile influenza cases among the total passengers. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions KK and HN conceived the study."}
