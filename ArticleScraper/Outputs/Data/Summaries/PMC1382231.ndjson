{"summary": "we have previously developed a test for the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) based on the detection of the SARS-coronavirus RNA in serum by real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) we evaluated the feasibility of automating the serum RNA extraction procedure in order to increase the throughput of the assay. 84 percent of infected individuals were shown to be positive by the test on the first day of hospital admission with no false-positive results. the serum SARS-CoV RNA concentration detected upon admission has also been shown to be predictive of the requirement for subsequent intensive care [4]. the approach has been demonstrated to be useful for serial monitoring of treatment efficacy. ic acid large volume isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics) is recommended for use with the MagNA Pure LC instrument. the former kit processes 200 L of serum and is compatible with an external lysis protocol. the latter kit processes 1000 L of serum and no external lysis protocol had been predefined. 450 L of lysis buffer was added to 690 L of specimen in a biosafety cabinet. the instrument was then activated to run as per the standard protocol. the externally-added lysis buffer amounts to a total of 860 L of lysis buffer for 690 L of specimen. aliquots of transport medium containing inactivated SARS-CoV ranging from 102 to 107 copies/mL were introduced. the modified large volume protocol was selected for further comparison with the performance of the column-based manual method. 2 kits, the MagNA Pure LC total nucleic acid isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics) and the MagNA Pure total nucleic acid large volume isolation kit (Roche Diagnostics) are recommended for use with the MagNA Pure LC instrument for the extraction of viral DNA or RNA from serum or plasma. the main differences lie in the starting sample volume and whether an external lysis protocol is available. 310 L of lysis buffer was first added to 690 L of specimen in a biosafety cabinet to make up a final volume of 1000 L. the instrument was then activated to run as per the standard protocol. all viral RNA preparations were quantified using a real time quantitative one-step RT-PCR assay targeting the nucleic acid-gene of the SARS-CoV. aliquots of transport medium diluted to contain 10, 102 and 103 copies/mL of inactivated SARS-CoV. five replicate extractions were performed for each concentration. the detection rate at each concentration was compared amongst the two methods. 103 and 105 copies/mL of inactivated SARS-CoV were found. the mean and coefficient of variation were determined and compared. the results were comparable to that of the standard large volume protocol. ed positive detection in all five replicates, while viral RNA extractions from the total nucleic acid kit was only positive in one replicate. the modified protocol of the large volume kit has comparable performance with the total nucleic acid kit for the extraction of samples containing high SARS-CoV concentration. the slope of the regression line being less than 1 suggests there is a proportional negative bias in serum SARS-CoV concentration extracted by the automated method. the slope of the regression line being less than 1 also suggests the presence of a proportional negative bias in serum SARS-CoV concentration extracted by the automated method. RNA extractions were repeated 10 times for serum aliquots containing SARS-CoV concentration well above the detection limit of the assay, namely 103 and 105 copies/mL. the assay coefficient of variation was 45.3% and 76.9%. modified large volume protocol yielded 4.92 108, 5.20 108 and 5.48 108 copies/mL. results were comparable to that of the standard large volume protocol. negative samples were tested negative regardless of the magnitude of the SARS-CoV concentrations in the adjacent wells. the modified protocol of the large volume kit was selected for further evaluation for SARS-CoV RNA extraction from serum. a similar comparison was performed for serially diluted SARS-CoV mixture in pooled sera. the slope of the regression line being less than 1 also suggests the presence of a proportional negative bias in serum SARS-CoV concentration extracted by the automated method. RNA extractions by each protocol were repeated 10 times for serum aliquots containing SARS-CoV concentration well above the detection limit of the assay. for serum SARS-CoV concentration at 105 copies/mL, the overall assay coefficient of variation was 45.3% and 76.9% when RNA extractions from manual and automated methods were quantified. the automated extraction method was compared with the quantitative performance of a previously described manual viral RNA extraction method based on the use of the QIAamp viral RNA mini kit (Qiagen) the manual method also contributed to better overall analytical precision as evident by the lower coefficients of variation. list of abbreviations SARS, severe acute respiratory syndrome; SARS-CoV, SARS-coronavirus, RT-PCR, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. competing interests Patent applications covering aspects of the quantitative RT-PCR test have been filed by The Chinese University of Hong Kong."}
