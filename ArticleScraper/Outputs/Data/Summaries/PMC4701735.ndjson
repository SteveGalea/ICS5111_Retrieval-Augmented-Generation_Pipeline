{"summary": "the widespread use of FQs has led to contaminating residues in foodstuffs derived from treated animals. antibiotics released into the natural ecosystem can modify the local environmental microbiota by changing the composition or activity. conventional methods such as liquid chromatography coupled to various detectors are used for detection of drug residues. previous studies have indicated the usefulness of nanoparticles for identification of pathogenic bacteria in DNA-microarrays, isolating target organisms from food matrices and screening metal ions in water [8,17,26]. a rapid purification method was used using monoclonal antibodies against mycotoxin and MNPs. experimental animals Five female BALB/c mice (6-week old) were purchased from Orient Bio Incorporated. the animal room was maintained at 22 2\u00b0C (relative humidity, 50% 10%) and illuminated using a 12-h day/12-h night cycle. initial injection of ENR-KLH conjugate was administered in equal volume of Freund's complete adjuvant. the following four injections were administered using Freund's incomplete adjuvant. spleen cells were mixed with SP2/O myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche, Germany) after overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C, plates were washed three times with washing buffer and blocked with 1% casein in PBS (w/v, 250 L/well), after which they were incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. each well was washed with washing buffer and 100 L of anti-mouse IgG- HRP conjugate (dilution 1: 1000 in 1% skim milk) was added and incubated for 1 h. a total of 3 mg of an amine-functionalized MNP suspension (100 L) was washed three times using a magnet in coupling buffer (0.01 M pyridine, pH 6.0), after which a 1 mL solution of 5% glutaraldehyde was added. the mixture was then rotated at 94 g overnight at room temperature, after which the MNP-mAb conjugates were washed with coupling buffer (500 L) dissociated enrofloxacin Enrofloxacin separated by MNP-mAb conjugates was detected via HPLC using an XTerra RP18 column (Waters, Ireland) the chromatographic column was then equilibrated with a mixture of water-acetonitrile-methanol (800 : 170 : 30; v/v/v/v) the flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.2 mL/min. experimental animals Five female BALB/c mice (6-week old) were purchased from Orient Bio Incorporated (Korea) the animal room was maintained at 22 2\u00b0C (relative humidity, 50% 10%) and illuminated using a 12-h day/12-h night cycle. experiments were performed in accordance with the Code of laboratory animal welfare ethics, national research and quarantine service, Korea (NVRQS). spleen cells were mixed with SP2/O myeloma cells using polyethylene glycol 1500 (Roche, Germany) the ratio of spleen cells from the immunized mouse fused with SP2/O myeloma cells was about 5. after 14 days, the ascites fluid was collected and monoclonal IgG from ascites was purified using protein chromatography (GE Healthcare) each well was washed with washing buffer and 100 L of TMB solution. color development was halted by adding 100 L of 2N H2SO4, and the absorbance at 450 nm was measured using a microtiter plate reader. MNP coupling to mAbs A total of 3 mg of an amine-functionalized MNP suspension (100 L) was washed three times using a magnet in coupling buffer (0.01 M pyridine, pH 6.0), after which a 1 mL solution of 5% glutaraldehyde was added. the mixture was then rotated at 94 g overnight at room temperature, after which the MNP-mAb conjugates were washed with coupling buffer (500 the chromatographic column was then equilibrated with a mixture of water-acetonitrile-methanol (800 : 170 : 30; v/v/v/v) the flow rate of the mobile phase was 1.2 mL/min. the eluate was monitored for ENR using a fluorescence detector. cross-reactivity levels of mAb to ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, sarafloxacin, pefloxacin and norfloxacin were 60, 52, 23, 14 and 8% respectively. IC50 was calculated as the concentration of a competitor that caused a 50% reduction in binding of the antibody to the coating antigen. Recoveries for ENR were observed in the range of 72.9 to 113.16%. the coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 2.42% to 10.11%. mAb-MNP conjugates could remove matrix components from animal meat. anti-ENR mAb (130 g) were coupled with 3 mg of MNP (n = 3) recovery rate (%) = (amount of purified ENR/amount of spiked ENR) 100. cross-reactivity levels of the mAb to ciprofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, difloxacin, sarafloxacin, pefloxacin and norfloxacin were 60, 52, 23, 14 and 8% respectively. IC50 values and cross-reactivity of anti-ENR toward selected fluoroquinolones using the optimized ELISA format. Recoveries for ENR were observed in the range of 72.9 to 113.16%. the coefficient of variation (CV) ranged from 2.42% to 10.11%. mAb-MNP conjugates could remove many matrixes. anti-ENR mAb (130 g) were coupled with 3 mg of MNP (n = 3) recovery rate (%) = (amount of purified ENR/amount of spiked ENR) 100. an analogous comparison of ciprofloxacin to norfloxacin results from alkyl substitution on the piperazinyl ring and cyclopropyl group replaced by a fluorophenyl group or ethyl group. this results indicate the possibility that anti-ENR strongly recognizes the cyclopropyl group and the ethyl group in the piperazinyl ring. a covalent anti-ENR mAb binding to the MNP surface was developed based on the reaction with the amino group of the antibody molecule in an MNP concentration-dependent manner [10]. the recoveries in our study ranged from 75.16 to 86.36%, while the CV values ranged from 5.08 to 11.53%."}
