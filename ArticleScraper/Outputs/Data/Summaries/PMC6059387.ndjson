{"summary": "study examines factors that influence when individuals transition from a negative to positive test (acquisition) to a positive to negative test (loss) of rhinovirus (HRV) and other respiratory tract viruses in 26 households followed weekly for one year. results Acquisition of HRV was less probable in older individuals and those infected with a coronavirus. study uses longitudinal data on a set of Utah households to detect host heterogeneity in susceptibility, transmission potential, and duration of infection. these infections are probably the most common symptomatic infections experienced by people in developed nations [1, 2], with human rhinovirus (HRV) generally the most common cause both in North America [1, 3, 4] and in the tropics and the southern hemisphere [5]. studies have documented patterns of HRV shedding. children have been implicated in numerous ways through higher prevalence in younger children [1, 4, 5, 24\u201326], in households with children [1, 26] and in parents [4]. study uses longitudinal data on 26 households tracked weekly over a year to measure host heterogeneity in susceptibility, transmission potential, and duration of HRV infection. larger households and households with younger children will have a higher prevalence of HRV, transmission will be lower from asymptomatic individuals. we use this simulation to test the effects of inclusion or exclusion of different factors on patterns of prevalence. we focus on the extent to which removal or simplification of age-dependent susceptibility and transmission would be predicted to change the prevalence and distribution of HRV in simulated populations with different average household sizes. we broke infected individuals up by age, sex, presence of symptoms, or combinations thereof. the households were not spatially clustered or otherwise connected. the households were not spatially clustered or otherwise connected. generalized additive models with a general function of week rather than a parametric form to test whether this absorbed any apparent signal of intrahousehold or interhousehold transmission. models were compared with the AIC, and tested with mixed effect and generalized additive models as above. logistic regression to find the logit for infection acquisition or loss. we manipulate the simulation model in three ways to quantify their effects on patterns of HRV prevalence. we use the observed households in the BIG-LoVE study. 1-4 with probabilities 0.081452, 0.260122, 0.346232, 0.312194 respectively. the simulation computes the probability of acquisition or loss from the current state of each individual and the number of infections within or outside the household in that week. for individuals with consecutive weekly nasal samples, we recorded acquisition of HRV for a given week if the test changed from negative in that week to negative in the next. we recorded loss of HRV if the test changed from positive in that week to negative in the next. to characterize households, we found the youngest other household member (excluding the focal individual, but set to the age of that individual in households of size 1). covariate range Week 1-52 Week2 12 522 Day length 9.68 14.56 Age (in years) 0\u201457 Age group 1\u20144 Sex Household size 1\u20148 Youngest 0\u201452 Health care worker 0 or 1 Day care 0 or

positive outside household simulation model based on a simplified version of the final logistic regression model. the probability of acquisition depends on four factors: week, age group, infections from within the household, and infections from outside the household. the probability of loss depends only on reinfections from within the household. the full model with age-dependent susceptibility, specific infection classes for intrahousehold and interhousehold transmission serves as a baseline. we used the observed households in the BIG-LoVE study. the simulation computes the probability of acquisition or loss from the current state of each individual. in the first 51 weeks of the study, we observed loss of HRV in 321 (43.8%), maintenance of HRV in 371 (50.6%), and no data in 285 (7.7%). in weeks with data to characterize HRV acquisition or loss, we observe 144 positive tests for coronavirus, 66 for paramyxovirus, 47 for influenza, and 188 for bocavirus. 1.171-1.830 0.0001 HRV

reinfection. prevalence in a household increases by 2% for each additional household member. this slope is reduced by 1.25% by neglecting age-dependent susceptibility. prevalence in a household increases by 2% for each additional household member. a simulation model of this community replicates and quantifys several previously identified patterns of susceptibility, transmission, reinfection and virus interaction. we find no evidence for transmission by adults, and transmission by individuals with symptoms is higher within households. our estimate of interhousehold transmission is based on treating the 26 households as a representative sample of the full population. the study is uncontrolled, so we cannot fully remove the effects of unmeasured covariates even with random effect models. results can be embedded into a larger scale long-term model that includes aging, births, and other changes in household structure. studies combine long-term tracking of individuals with detailed information on viral serotypes and immune status."}
