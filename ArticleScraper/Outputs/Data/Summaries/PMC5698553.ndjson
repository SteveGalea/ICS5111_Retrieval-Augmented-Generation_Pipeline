{"summary": "Coronaviruses, members of the order Nidovirales, have the largest known positive stranded RNA genomes, ranging from 26 to 33.5 kb (5\u20137). the 5\u2032-proximal two-thirds of the genome contains the replicase gene. replicase polyproteins are co- and post-translationally processed into 15 or 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp\u2019s) by two or three ORF1a-encoded proteases (9 the region downstream of nsp4 is cleaved by the 3C-like cysteine protease or main protease (Mpro) located in nsp5. the expected cleavage of the nsp3/nsp4 junction by PLpro is indicated. the epitope tags used at the termini of the constructs are indicated with ovals. nsp4 bands in the nsp3 IP were fuzzy likely due to the relatively high hydrophobicity of the protein. nsp3 was detected with anti-SARS-CoV-nsp3 serum. nsp4 was detected with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody. nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6 subunits of the coronavirus replicase are prime candidates for directing RO formation. each of these proteins spans the membrane multiple times (2, 4, and 6 times, respectively), and they have 1, 2, and 3 luminal loops. nsp4s of both MHV and SARS-CoV contain sites (2 and 1, respectively) for N-linked glycosylation in the first luminal loop of nsp nsp6 are nonconventional transmembrane proteins in the sense that they are derived from a polyprotein and do not contain N-terminal signal sequences for cotranslational membrane insertion. nsp2, nsp3, and nsp5 of the distantly related arteriviruses can be considered equivalent to coronavirus nsp3, nsp4, and nsp6, in terms of their relative position in the replicase mERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 coexpressed from separate plasmids or expressed as a self-cleaving polyprotein fragment (nsp3-4) are essential and sufficient for the formation of DMVs that assemble into an RVN. nsp3-4 polyprotein processing was prevented by mutagenesis. this blocked the formation of DMVs while membrane pairing did still occur. we expressed nsp3 and nsp4 from a CAG promoter (43) either by cotransfection of cells with plasmids encoding individual proteins or by transfection with a single plasmid encoding a self-cleaving nsp3-4 polyprotein fragment. the constructs were transfected into 293T cells to verify protein expression and processing. nsp4-V5 was coimmunoprecipitated when nsp4-V5 was present (right panel) these findings demonstrate that these two MERS-CoV proteins interact. this is a common feature of coronaviruses. MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 are required and sufficient to induce DMV formation. the next step was to determine whether nsp3 and nsp4 could induce the formation of double-membrane structures similar to those observed during infection. HuH-7 cells expressed either individual nsp\u2019s (C and D) or both nsp3 and nsp4, following either cotransfection with two plasmids (nsp3 + nsp4) or expression of a self-cleaving precursor (nsp3-4) (E and F), analyzed using EM at 24 h posttransfection. expression of SARS-CoV nsp4 did not result in changes in intracellular membrane morphology (42), in contrast to our present observations following MERS-CoV nsp4 expression. a combination of circular double-membrane profiles (red asterisks) and paired membranes (red arrows) was present in both cases, suggesting that the combined expression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 is sufficient to induce DMV formation a quantitative analysis was carried out on samples of cells expressing MERS-CoV nsp3-4. approximately 40% of the transfected cells were positive for expression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4. around 19% of the cell sections (n = 288) contained double-membrane structures. putative DMVs (circular profiles) and zippered ER clustered together in the cells. in each image, two of the visible putative DMVs are marked with red asterisks. the red arrows point at zippered ER stretches. a new tab induces the formation of DMVs that are organized in an RVN. HuH-7 cells were cotransfected with constructs expressing nsp3 and nsp4. some of the fully reconstructed closed DMVs are indicated with red asterisks. the tomograms corroborated the structural similarity between the membrane structures induced by cotransfection with nsp3 and nsp4 constructs. the paired membranes were often continuous with ER cisternae (Fig. 3B, red asterisks) such structures have not been observed in coronavirus-infected cells. paired membranes in which the zippered ER seemed to transform into a nascent DMV could readily be observed in the tomograms. nsp3-4-expressing and MERS-CoV-infected cells are sufficient to trigger all the membrane-remodeling steps required for inducing DMV formation. nsp3-5-GFP-6 polyprotein was processed into four separate nsp\u2019s and GFP. nsp3-5-GFP-6 polyprotein was processed into two copies of the nsp5/6 cleavage site. nsp3-5-GFP-6 polyprotein was processed into four separate nsp\u2019s and GFP. 293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids and labeled with [35S]methionine-cysteine from 4 to 20 h posttransfection. the 130-kDa band in samples precipitated with anti-HA serum is the same as the one observed when only nsp3 was expressed. nsp4 bands and putative nsp4- and nsp6-containing precursor bands were fuzzy. cubic membranes (49) can result from overexpression and/or misfolding of ER proteins. the average size of these DMVs (146 nm) was comparable to that of DMVs induced by nsp3-4 expression (148 nm) however, none of these regions contained CM or spherules. we transfected cells with plasmids encoding nsp3-4 carrying either a mutated nsp3/nsp4 cleavage site (GG>AA) or a catalytic site mutation in the nsp3 PLpro domain (C1592A) that inactivates the protease (50). in both cases, only the uncleaved nsp3-4 precursor was observed. 293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids. nsp3 was detected with anti-SARS-nsp3 serum. nsp4 was detected with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody. nsp4 was detected with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody. nsp3 and nsp4 of either virus differ in their ability to induce DMV formation in the absence of nsp6. we coexpressed nsp3 and nsp4 using the same experimental setup previously used for SARS-CoV by angelini et al. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4. red asterisks indicate all the DMVs in this virtual slice that were fully reconstructed in the tomogram. MOVIE S4 Three-dimensional reconstruction of the membrane structures induced by coexpression of SARS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4. the movie progresses first along the z axis of the reconstruction through consecutive virtual slices (1.67 nm thick) and then loops back. nsp3 and nsp4 colocalize in the perinuclear region of the cell. the transmembrane nsp\u2019s of MERS-CoV are able to induce DMV formation. the constructs were transfected into 293T cells to verify protein expression and processing. nsp4-V5 was coimmunoprecipitated when nsp4-V5 was present. nsp4-V5 was coimmunoprecipitated when nsp4-V5 was present. nsp3 was coimmunoprecipitated when nsp4-V5 was present. nsp3 and nsp4 are required and sufficient to induce DMV formation. the next step was to determine whether nsp3 and nsp4 could induce the formation of double-membrane structures similar to those observed during infection. HuH-7 cells were infected with MERS-CoV (A) or mock infected (B) and analyzed at 10 h p.i. using EM. several DMVs are indicated with red asterisks, and several spherules are indicated with red arrows. the expression of nsp4 did not result in changes in intracellular membrane morphology. a combination of circular double-membrane profiles (red asterisks) and paired membranes (red arrows) was present in both cases, suggesting that the combined expression of MERS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4 is sufficient to induce DMV formation. one hundred profiles were measured for each condition and plotted as a box-and-whisker plot. the boxes show the 25th to 75th percentile, and the whiskers show the total range of the measurements. these membrane modifications were frequently found in all the samples analyzed. HuH-7 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding MERS-CoV nsp3-4. the images display areas with double-membrane structures in different cells. putative DMVs (circular profiles) and zippered ER clustered together in the cells. we found no openings connecting the DMV interior and the cytosol. some of the fully reconstructed closed DMVs are indicated with red asterisks. some of the fully reconstructed closed DMVs are indicated with red asterisks. MOVIE S2 Three-dimensional reconstruction of membrane structures induced by coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 as a self-cleaving precursor. some of the DMVs that were fully reconstructed (i.e., originally contained in the cell section) are indicated with green dots. paired membranes were often continuous with ER cisternae. they resembled the zippered ER that has also been observed in betacoronavirus-infected cells. structures in which the zippered ER seemed to transform into a nascent DMV could readily be observed in tomograms. nsp4/nsp5 and nsp5/nsp6 junctions should be processed by the nsp5-based Mpro. the kinetics of MERS-CoV polyprotein processing in cell-based assays have not been documented in any detail. 293T cells were transfected with indicated plasmids and labeled with [35S]methionine-cysteine from 4 to 20 h posttransfection. nsp4 bands and putative nsp4- and nsp6-containing precursor bands were fuzzy, likely due to their relatively large hydrophobic domains. nsp3- or nsp4-expressing cells consisted of double membranes. cubic membranes (49) can result from overexpression and/or misfolding of ER proteins, leading to protein and membrane aggregation. the average size of these DMVs (146 nm) was comparable to that of those induced by nsp3-4 expression (148 nm) plasmids encoding nsp3-4 carried either a mutated nsp3/nsp4 cleavage site (GG>AA) or a catalytic site mutation in the nsp3 PLpro domain (C1592A) that inactivates the protease (50). in both cases, only the uncleaved nsp3-4 precursor was observed. cleavage of MERS-CoV nsp3/nsp4 junction is essential for DMV formation. nsp3 was detected with anti-SARS-nsp3 serum. nsp4 was detected with anti-V5 monoclonal antibody. angelini et al. coexpressed nsp3 and nsp4 of either virus. nsp3 and nsp4 led to formation of MLBs very similar to those observed by Angelini et al. (42), with areas of zippered ER often clustered as regularly spaced profiles, and circular double-membrane profiles. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids encoding SARS-CoV nsp3 and nsp4. red asterisks indicate all the DMVs in this virtual slice that were fully reconstructed in the tomogram. the movie progresses first along the z axis of the reconstruction through consecutive virtual slices (1.67 nm thick) and then loops back, marking with green dots all the DMVs that were fully reconstructed. the movie is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 of either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV was required and sufficient to trigger the formation of ER-derived DMVs. the 3D architecture of these membrane structures was similar to what has been observed during betacoronavirus infection. nsp2 and nsp3 were found to be required and sufficient for DMV formation. these proteins share a number of features like the presence of multiple membrane-spanning domains and a papain-like protease in the upstream protein that cleaves the junction between the two subunits. these functional similarities and the potential to trigger DMV formation may thus be shared by these proteins of all coronaviruses and arteriviruses. membranes would first pair or \u201czipper\u201d and then curve and finally form a closed DMV after a membrane fission event (18, 55). the frequent observation of zippered ER after coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4 and multiple EM images in which zippered ER seemed to wrap into a DMV suggest that this structure is a DMV precursor. a truncated nsp3 lacking the region upstream of TM1 coexpressed with nsp4 was sufficient to induce membrane pairing. this suggests that the TM1 region (together with nsp4) may be sufficient to induce membrane pairing. however, we found no major differences between DMVs induced by expression of self-cleaving nsp3-4 and those induced by coexpression of nsp3 and nsp4. the proximal (and largest) luminal loop of nsp4 contains an N-linked glycosylation site (N2985 in MERS-CoV) similar to the glycosylation site(s) in SARS-CoV and MHV (34, 37, 40) analysis of the use of that site in proteolytically processed nsp4 could provide insight into the sequence of events leading to the membrane insertion of MERS-CoV nsp4. CM are mostly formed relatively late in infection (19, 21, 24) when viral proteins or polyprotein fragments accumulate. this could lead to aggregation, misfolding, and/or impaired polyprotein processing. there could be a link between the status of polyprotein processing in the nsp4-6 region and the membrane structures formed. onavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) is a gamma- and an alphacoronavirus. a rabbit serum recognizing SARS-CoV-nsp3 cross-reacts with MERS-CoV nsp3 has been previously described. human codon-optimized coding sequences of MERS-CoV nsp3-6 were designed using GeneArt. the nsp4 construct included the 21 C-terminal aa of nsp3 to prevent the n-terminal hydrophobic region of nsp4 from acting as a signal sequence. cells were lysed in 2 Laemmli sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, 4% [wt/vol] sodium dodecyl sulfate [SDS], 20 mM dithiothreitol, 0.02 mg/ml bromophenol blue) and separated by electrophoresis on SDS-polyacrylamide gels. 293T cells were labeled with 100 Ci/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. cells were lysed at 18 h posttransfection in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.6), 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (wt/vol) deoxycholic acid, 1% (vol/vol) nonidet P-40, and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS. glutaraldehyde in 0.10 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) for 1 h at room temperature. cells were scraped and stained with 1% (wt/vol) tannic acid. samples were embedded in epoxy resin (LX-112; Ladd Research) and after polymerization, 100-nm sections were placed on mesh-100 copper EM grids covered with a carbon-coated Pioloform layer. colloidal gold particles of 10 nm were applied to both sides of the EM grid to serve as fiducial markers for alignment. FEI Tecnai 12 BioTwin (HuH-7 samples) or a Twin (293T samples) electron microscope operated at 120 kV, with the grids mounted on a 2040 Fischione tomography holder. a rabbit serum recognizing SARS-CoV-nsp3 cross-reacts with MERS-CoV nsp3 has been previously described (21, 22) a polyclonal rabbit serum was used against a combination of two MERS-CoV nsp5 peptides, SGLVKMSHPSGDVEAC (amino acids 3248 to 3263 of pp1a) and CPADQLSDPNYDALLI (amino acids pCAGGS-SARS-nsp4 was described previously (42). 293T cells were transfected using a Nucleofector 2b device (Lonza) in 6 106 cells and 12 g of plasmid DNA per transfection. cells were lysed in 2 Laemmli sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 6.8, 20% [vol/vol] glycerol, 4% [wt/vol] sodium do 293T cells were labeled with 100 Ci/ml [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine. lysates were diluted in immunoprecipitation buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.6], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (wt/vol) deoxycholic acid, 1% (vol/vol) nonidet P-40, and 0.1% (wt/vol) SDS. transfected cells were fixed 24 h posttransfection in 0.10 M cacodylate buffer. cells were scraped and stained with 1% (wt/vol) tannic acid in milli-Q water. samples were embedded in epoxy resin (LX-112; Ladd Research) one hundred circular profiles were measured for each condition. electron tomography. sections of 150-nm thickness were cut from resin-embedded blocks of transfected cells."}
