{"summary": "acute exacerbations adversely affect chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) prognosis by accelerating loss of lung function. it is important to know microorganisms that commonly cause exacerbations in the patient groups classified according to clinical and functional characteristics. studies have shown that patients with severe or very severe air flow limitation tend to be at high risk of exacerbations. higher exacerbation rates are associated with a faster loss of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) and greater worsening of overall health status. a significant relationship between low FEV1 and frequency of various organisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacteriaceae, was shown. however, there have not been similar studies that have included symptom scores and exacerbation frequency in the groups classified according to the new GOLD staging system. CAT and a pulmonary function test were provided to the patients. all pulmonary function tests were performed by the same technician after the administration of 400 g salbutamol while the patient was stable. the combined COPD assessment scaling was applied according to GOLD 2011 criteria. mycoplasma pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter cloacae bacteria were done with an RDB 2245/RDB 2246 BAC HOSPITAL (Gen ID\u00ae; Autoimmun Diagnostika GmbH) multiplex PCR kit according to the experts\u2019 suggestions. patients were divided into four groups, GOLD A, B, C, and D. Sputum samples were taken from patients to a sterile container after rinsing the mouth and throat. all patients were informed about the study. their written consent was taken. 114 patients, whose ages ranged from 39 years to 86 years, were included in the study. there was no difference in terms of age, sex, and smoking. there was no difference in terms of age, sex, and smoking. single or multiple bacteria were observed for 66.6% of the patients. most frequent bacteria were Gram-positive cocci with 33.3%. 2 Staphylococcus aureus 2 (1.7) 1 1 Acinetobacter baumannii 1 (0.9) 1 Bacterial isolation total (%) 36.8 28.5 36.6 31 43.9 PCRa Negative 40 (35.1) 6 11 11 12 S. pneumoniae 18 (15.8) 4 4 5 5 H. influenzae 18 (15.8) 3 4 5 6 S. pneumoniae + H. influenzae 8 (7) 2 2 4 M. catarrhalis 7 (6.1) 1 3 1 0.159 18.5 16.0 0.301 Exacerbations (mean) 1.5 1.0 0.083 1.43 0.84 0.002 GOLD class (n, groups A/B/C/D) at least one bacterial agent was obtained for 65% of the patients (Table 2). there was no significant relationship between PPB isolation and exacerbation frequency (P=0.002) the PCR method detected bacteria in 40 out of 42 patients with positive cultures. there were only two patients who had positive cultures but did not have bacteria according to the PCR results. culture results At least one bacterial growth was detected in 42 (36.8%) patients\u2019 culture. 1 1 Acinetobacter baumannii 1 (0.9) 1 Bacterial isolation total (%) 36.8 28.5 36.6 31 43.9 PCRa Negative 40 (35.1) 6 11 11 12 S. pneumoniae 18 (15.8) 4 4 5 5 H. influenzae 18 (15.8) 3 4 5 6 S. pneumoniae + H. influenzae 8 (7) 2 2 4 M. catarrhalis 7 (6.1) 1 3 1 2 K. pneumoniae 7 (6.1) 1 3 1 3 E in PCR, there was a significant difference between PPB isolation and exacerbation frequency (P=0.002) in PCR, there was a significant difference between PPB isolation and exacerbation frequency (P=0.002) as in culture, quantity and diversity of bacteria in group D were higher. the PCR method detected bacteria in 40 out of 42 patients with positive cultures. there were only two patients who had positive cultures but did not have bacteria according to the PCR results. there was a significant difference between culture and PCR methods in terms of detection rates of multiple pathogens. culture, while P. aeruginosa, E. coli, and A. baumannii were isolated only in patients with a 50% FEV1 value. there was no significant difference between GOLD stage and culture results of the patients. PCR was more discriminatory than culture in 40 of 42 patients with positive cultures. mixed infections, which cannot be found in culture, were detected by PCR (n=19) mixed infections, which cannot be found in culture, were detected by PCR (n=19) patel et al26 observed 29 patients with COPD for 529 days. found a significant relationship between exacerbation frequency and increased colonization. however, lower airway bacterial colonization seems to be more frequent. most commonly rhinoviruses followed by metapneumovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, corona-virus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus were isolated from patients with severe COPD. mixed infections are more frequent in patients with severe COPD. we propose the necessity of prospective studies that are based on long-term monitoring, contain groups with lower FEV1 scores, and are conducted with wide patient populations."}
