{"summary": "influenza virus is a highly transmissible respiratory pathogen, resulting in >200,000 hospitalizations in the united states annually. ocular complications have been documented following seasonal, 2009 H1N1 pandemic, and avian H5N1 virus infections in humans [7]\u2013[13]. ocular exposure to influenza virus can manifest in both ocular and respiratory disease. it is clear from epidemiological and laboratory data that ocular exposure to influenza virus can manifest in both ocular and respiratory disease. but the properties that contribute towards ocular tropism of select influenza virus subtypes are not well understood. ferret corneal epithelial sheets with biotinylated lectins specific for 2\u20133 and 2\u20136 sialic acids revealed a predominance of 2\u20133-linked sialic acids with relatively weak expression of 2\u20136 sialic acids on the epithelial surface. to assess the pathogenicity of influenza viruses of multiple subtypes following ocular inoculation in

no ferrets survived until day 9 p.i. the incidence of nasal discharge was reduced following i.o. inoculation with all influenza viruses tested, and sneezing was less frequent in ferrets following infection with human influenza viruses. ocular inoculation with all H7 influenza viruses tested resulted in elevated peak mean viral titers in NW samples. all seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses evaluated were detected at high titer in both NW and CW samples. i.o. inoculation with mex/4108, Brisbane, and Panama viruses, along with the H7N7 NL/230 virus, resulted in the highest peak mean titers in CW samples. avian and human influenza viruses were capable of mounting a productive infection in ferrets following i.o. inoculation i.n. inoculation with the H7N7 viruses tested in this study results in high virus titers throughout the respiratory tract of ferrets. a similar pattern of virus dissemination following i.o. inoculation was observed when ferrets were inoculated by the i.n route using a 100 l and not 1 mL inoculation volume. i.n.e 5.8 0.6 (3/3) 6.90.3 (3/3) 2.9 (1/3) 2.2 (1/3) ND 4.31.3 (3/3) ND NL/219 i.o. 5.01.6 (4/6) 4.90.5 (2/2) 3.4 (1/2) 3.2 (1/2) 2.10.8 (4/6) 4.01.0 (2/2) ND

sporadic viral titers from both left and right eye and conjunctival tissue were detected following both i.n. or i.o. inoculation routes. virus was also detected in left and right conjunctival tissue. flu virus antigen was detected in epithelial cells in the conjunctiva and the ciliary processes in the eye. the route of virus inoculation in ferrets can affect the extent of virus dissemination in respiratory tract tissue, but extra-pulmonary spread, notably to ocular tissue, is present regardless of the point of entry once an infection is established. ferrets were euthanized 15 minutes following virus inoculation. fluorescent-labeled A/NL/219/03 virus (NL219-FL) was administered to ferrets by the ocular route. each ferret was euthanized 15 min following virus inoculation. administration and organs were collected for ex vivo imaging. an increasing fluorescence signal is indicated by brightness from red to yellow. percentages represent the mean maximum relative efficiency for each tissue (n = 3) above levels in corresponding nave tissue. titers 100.98\u20132.25 EID50) and NL/230 contact ferrets had detectable infectious virus in CW (3/3 ferrets, peak titers 100.98\u20132.25 EID50) and RS (2/3 ferrets, peak titers 101.98\u20132.75 EID50) samples. these results indicate that virus transmission in the presence of direct contact can occur following exposure to ferrets which exhibit a respiratory infection generated by i ferrets inoculated by the ocular route with either Brisbane or Panama only transmitted virus by respiratory droplets to 1/3 contact ferrets. despite high titers of virus in NW samples, the respiratory infection resulting from inoculation of ferrets with a reduced volume, by either ocular or intranasal inoculation routes, is distinct from that following traditional i.n. inoculation. ferret model is frequently used to model the kinetics and severity of respiratory disease following administration of human and avian influenza viruses by the intranasal route [23], [25]. to determine if this homology extends to ocular tissue, we examined the composition of sialic acids on the ferret cornea, which represents a potential site of influenza virus replication following ocular inoculation. 106 EID50 ocular inoculation in ferrets Virus Name in study Subtypea # ferrets infectedb # ferrets survived % mean max wt

as early as day 1 p.i. the duration of virus shedding from NW samples and transient fever and weight loss generally mirrored that seen following intranasal (i.n.) inoculation for each virus [26]\u2013[29]. sneezing was less frequent in ferrets following infection with human influenza viruses. all seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses evaluated were detected at high titer in both NW and CW

inoculated by the ocular route succumb to a similar course of disease as intranasally inoculated ferrets. however, following i.o. inoculation there is a delay in both the kinetics of virus dissemination and the development of neurological signs and severe disease. sporadic viral titers from both left and right eye and conjunctival tissue were detected following HPAI H7N7 virus infection by both i virus was also detected in left and right conjunctival tissue following i.n. or i.o. inoculation of the H1N1 virus Brisbane. virus was only detected in CW samples collected from the eyes of ferrets inoculated by the ocular route. the route of virus inoculation in ferrets can affect the extent of virus dissemination in respiratory tract tissue. ferrets were euthanized 15 minutes following virus inoculation. the majority of virus was deposited in the nasal turbinates and lungs. the majority of virus was deposited in the nasal turbinates and lungs. eled A/NL/219/03 virus (NL219-FL) was administered to ferrets by the intranasal or ocular route. each ferret was euthanized 15 min following virus administration. an increasing fluorescence signal is indicated by brightness from red to yellow. high titers of virus in the NW of contact ferrets, NY/107 contact ferrets with detectable virus in CW samples also had detectable infectious virus in CW samples. all NL/230 and NY/107 DC contact ferrets seroconverted by the end of the observation period. these results indicate that virus transmission in the presence of direct contact can occur following exposure to ferrets which exhibit a respiratory infection generated by i.o. inoculation. ferrets inoculated by the ocular route with either Brisbane or Panama only transmitted virus by respiratory droplets to 1/3 contact ferrets. a nave ferret was placed in an adjacent cage with modified side walls, so that air exchange was permitted between inoculated and contact ferrets in the absence of direct or indirect contact. the ferret has proved essential for the study of influenza virus pathogenesis and transmission. the use of the ferret to examine alternate inoculation methods has been limited [32], [35]\u2013[38]. a previous study in ferrets reported mild conjunctival inflammation following i.o. inoculation with an H7N3 virus. virus was consistently detected in CW samples from ferrets inoculated by the intranasal or ocular route. levels of viral M1 RNA generally correlated with the magnitude of virus isolation. ferret model supported virus replication of both human and avian influenza viruses following i.o. inoculation [20]. the ferret model supported virus replication of both human and avian influenza viruses following i.o. inoculation [20]. ocular lacrimal sac to the nasal meatus could serve as a conduit for virus-containing fluid exchange between ocular and respiratory tract tissue. i.n. inoculation with human or avian influenza viruses has not been observed previously in the ferret and only sporadically reported in the mouse. ocular lacrimal sac to the nasal meatus could serve as a conduit for virus-containing fluid exchange between ocular and respiratory tract tissue. i.o. and i.n. inoculation using a 100 l volume resulted in detection of virus at high titers in upper and not lower respiratory tract tissues day 3 p.i. the delay in high virus titer recovery from i.o. inoculation and the delay in onset of severe disease is likely due to replication-dependent spread (and not deposition) of virus to the lower respiratory tract. despite efficient replication of seasonal H1N1 and H3N2 viruses in the upper respiratory tract of ferrets following i.o. inoculation, these viruses did not result in frequent detection of sneezing and nasal discharge. infrequent sneezing is commonly observed among influenza viruses which do not transmit efficiently by respiratory droplets. the majority of human cases of conjunctivitis following i.o. inoculation are self-limiting [50] further study evaluating the shedding of virus into the environment will shed light on potential differences in transmission dynamics independent of virus subtype. the diversity of potential exposures to influenza virus underscores the importance of studying the establishment of influenza virus respiratory disease. fluorescent-tagged virus (NL/219-FL) was generated using formalin-inactivated NL/219 virus and a SAIVI Antibody Alexa Fluor 680 Labeling kit (Invitrogen) per manufacturer's instructions. all experiments with HPAI viruses were conducted under biosafety level 3 containment. any ferret which lost >25% of pre-inoculation body weight or exhibited neurological dysfunction was euthanized. i.n. or i.o. inoculation, three ferrets per group were inoculated with indicated viruses and euthanized 3 days p.i. for postmortem examination and collection of tissues for virus titration. aliquot of each virus stock used to characterize transmissibility in previous publications by the i.n.
