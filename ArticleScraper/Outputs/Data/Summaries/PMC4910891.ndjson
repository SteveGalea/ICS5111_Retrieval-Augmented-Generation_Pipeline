{"summary": "studies using wild-type and attenuated influenza strains have shown increases in the density of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus in the nasopharyngeal mucosa. there is no experimental evidence on this subject in humans. participants and Randomization Children aged 2\u20134 years were eligible to participate. only children for whom the vaccine was contraindicated were excluded. at enrollment, children were individually randomized 1:1 within nurseries. the child was seated comfortably with the head slightly extended. the swab was inserted horizontally until resistance was met when the swab was retracted with a slight twisting action along the axis of the shaft. rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza (types 1\u20133), parechovirus, coronavirus (229E, OC43, and NL63) and enterovirus were performed using methods described previously (4, 18) an assay for coronavirus HKU1 (see table E1 in the online supplement) was used. random effects (intercept) for nurseries and children to allow for repeated measures in the same individuals and between-nursery variability. we modeled the effect of the vaccine from one visit after the vaccine was administered. analyses were undertaken using the GLLAMM program in Stata (19\u201321) data for the second LAIV dose relate only to the group that received vaccine at visits 1 and 3. Table 2. Arithmetic mean ratio (95% CI) of carriage density adjusted by months of age, sex, smoker in the home, number of siblings, presence of viral nucleic acid, and time. too few children carried Staphylococcus aureus for statistical analysis. a cohort stepped wedge study of an LAIV containing three (two A and one B) influenza strains in children at 10 day care centers in Bristol, UK. participants and Randomization Children aged 2\u20134 years attending the DCCs were eligible to participate. only children for whom the vaccine was contraindicated were excluded. a fine-tip pediatric NP swab (Peel Pouch Dryswab; Medical Wire and Equipment, Corsham, UK) was taken. the child was seated comfortably with the head slightly extended. the swab was inserted horizontally until resistance was met. the cycle threshold (Ct) value used to define detection was set at less than or equal to 35 cycles. qPCR assays for adenovirus, bocavirus, influenza (A and B), respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza (types 1\u20133), parechovirus, coronavirus, and enterovirus were performed using methods described previously (4, 18) random effects (intercept) for nurseries and children to allow for repeated measures in the same individuals and between-nursery variability. we also estimated the odds ratios of carriage after one and two doses of LAIV (i.e., children contributed measurements before and after their vaccination) data for the second LAIV dose relate only to the group that received vaccine at visits 1 and 3. Table 2. Arithmetic mean ratio (95% CI) of carriage density adjusted by months of age, sex, presence of smoker in the home, number of siblings, presence of viral nucleic acid. 125 children completed the vaccination protocol, and 120 completed all visits. the number of subjects recruited in each DCC ranged from 4 to 29. the median durations after the second vaccine dose were 7 days. male sex 35/74 (47.3) 37/77 (48.1) 0.93 Mean number of siblings 0.69 (0.77) 1.04 (1.02) 0.02 Underlying medical condition 11/74 (14.9) 17/77 (22.1) 0.25 Parental smoking 6/73 (8.2) 5/74 (6.8) 0.74 National vaccination schedule not complete 2/73 (2.7) 1/77 (1.3) 0.53 Given influenza vaccine in previous two seasons. at baseline, carriage prevalence was high for S. pneumoniae, M. catarrhalis, and H. influenzae (68.3%, 77.6%, and 57.8%, respectively) there was no evidence to suggest a difference between the two study groups in the detection of these bacterial species. a sixfold higher mean bacterial density was found in children positive for carriage in the vaccinated group. there was no evidence to suggest a difference in mean bacterial density between the study groups at baseline (V1) and 7 days (V2) after vaccination. there was no evidence of a difference at either V2 or V3 (7 or 28 d after vaccination) for M. catarrhalis or H. influenzae. there was a trend toward higher density carriage in vaccinees. arithmetic mean ratio allows for clustering by nursery. too few children carried Staphylococcus aureus for statistical analysis. 42 of these children tested positive for carriage of S. pneumoniae. there was also evidence of vaccine-associated increases in M. catarrhalis density in carriers, with a more than doubling observed after the first vaccine dose. the relationship between nasal discharge score and bacterial density was investigated by including nasal discharge scores in the S. pneumoniae model. catarrhalis, and H. influenzae (68.3%, 77.6%, and 57.8%, respectively) and lower for S. aureus (10.6%) there was no evidence to suggest a difference between the groups. there was no evidence to suggest a difference between the groups. a sixfold higher mean bacterial density was found in children positive for carriage in the vaccinated group. there was no evidence of a difference at either V2 or V3 (7 or 28 d after vaccination) for M. catarrhalis or H. influenzae. a trend toward higher density carriage in vaccinees (Figure E1). Table 5. Carriage Density of Bacterial Species in Early Vaccine and Control Groups, in Individuals who Were Carriage Positive at Baseline Streptococcus pneumoniae Moraxella catarrhalis Haemophilus influenzae Mean Carriage Density* (GC/ml [SD]) Mean Ratio (95% CI) P Value Mean Carriage Density* arithmetic mean ratio allows for clustering by nursery. too few children carried Staphylococcus aureus for statistical analysis. the relationship between nasal discharge score (Symptoms of Nasal Outflow Tally score) and bacterial density was investigated by including nasal discharge scores in the S. pneumoniae model. evidence was found for an independent positive association with pneumococcal density (Table E3). children aged 2 years and older without any safety signals that one might attribute to higher bacterial density such as otitis media, pneumonia, or bacteremia. one might expect evolutionary pressures to select for bacteria that exploit the ubiquitous respiratory viral infections of early childhood to promote colonization and transmission while minimizing serious pathology in their hosts. s in density at V3 (28 d) apparently similar to those seen for S. pneumoniae (Figure E1), observations that are concordant with those made in animal models (15). the size of the effects seen was sufficiently large to allow for possible biological effects on transmission rates. if cultures were done, doubtless some PCR-positive, culture-negative individuals would have been found. however, it represents a footprint of recent bacterial presence. it will be important to perform follow-up confirmatory studies and to elucidate how the bacterial density measurements relate to efficiency of transmission between colonized children. the authors thank the european Society for pediatric infectious diseases and AstraZeneca for funding support. the authors also thank Darryl Hill, Caroline Trotter and Jolanta Bernatoniene for advice on study design."}
