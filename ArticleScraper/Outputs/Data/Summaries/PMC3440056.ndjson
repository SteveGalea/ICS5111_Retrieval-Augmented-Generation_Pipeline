{"summary": "the presence of IR is an important component of metabolic syndrome (MS) in human patients. there is now evidence that EMS-affected horses can be further characterized by demonstrating upregulated markers of inflammation19,20 and a propensity to develop arterial hypertension. laminitis is a common, painful equine condition in which lameness results from abnormalities of growth and degenerative changes in the hoof lamellar interface. laminitis represents the most common clinically important chronic disease for which identification of EMS contributes increased risk. equine hyperlipemia syndrome is similar to nonalcoholic steatohepatosis. secondary DM (type S), impaired glucose tolerance, and gestational diabetes are other categories of classification that are described in the human literature. equine veterinary literature concerning DM includes several references to the development of IR, attributable to hyperadrenocorticism. a few cases of bona fide DM have been reported to develop in adult horses. DM may have resulted from coronavirus infection, which has been identified as a cause of pancreatic damage in other species. the clinical utility of HbA1c and fructosamine has not been extensively evaluated in horses because DM is rare in this species. the clinical utility of HbA1c and fructosamine has not been extensively evaluated in horses. the euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp technique and the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test have been adopted for use in horses as the \u201cgold standard\u201d tests for IR. however, these methods have been used mostly in research settings. clinically practical dynamic tests for IR in horses include the combined intravenous glucose\u2013insulin test (CGIT) and an orally administered sugar test. the CGIT results are characterized by a two-phase curve with positive (hyperglycemic) and negative (hypoglycemic) portions. the equine species is characterized by a highly developed \u201cflight\u201d response. a serum insulin concentration of >60 mU/ml at that time is supportive of the presence of IR. the clinical administration of dynamic endocrine testing may therefore yield false positive results for IR if the patient is affected by stress. veterinary clinical recognition of EMS primarily serves to facilitate prevention of laminitis in EMS-affected horses and ponies. when EMS is diagnosed before painful laminitis has occurred, the application of increased physical activity is not possible because it leads to the worsening of damage in the hoof-lamellar interface. the optimal diet for management of DM in horses is unknown. a low glycemic ration characterized by high fiber content, low NSCs, and added calories in the form of fat is regarded as a logical choice. pioglitazone hydrochloride, a thiazolidinedione, has efficacy to reduce obesity-associated inflammation in humans. preliminary studies have not demonstrated an insulin-sensitizing action for pioglitazone when administered to horses. further investigations into the dose requirements for this species are being undertaken."}
