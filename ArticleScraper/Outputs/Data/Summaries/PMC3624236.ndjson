{"summary": "HBoV1 is one of the etiological agents of acute respiratory tract infections (ARTI), especially those causing wheezing in young children (3\u201314). the pseudostratified and well-differentiated primary human airway epithelium (HAE) culture model is the best in vitro model of the human airway epithelium (15, 16) polarized primary HAE cultures were made by growing isolated human airway epithelial cells at an ALI. apical washes of purified HBoV1-infected primary HAE culture were applied to the apical chamber. the apical surface was washed three times with 0.4 ml of phosphate-rich phosphate-rich. the production of progeny virions following apical infection was monitored daily by collecting samples from both the apical and basolateral chambers of the ALI culture. a yield of 108 VGC/l was consistently detected in infections at MOIs from 100 to 0.1 VGC/cell. an aliquot of 200 l PBS was added to the apical chamber of the HAE culture. the basolateral chamber of the HAE culture was incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. aliquot of 100 l of medium was also collected and replaced with 100 l of fresh ALI medium. thelium and the presence of cilia, correlated with the MOI of input viruses. at 12 days p.i., the flattening of the HAE inoculated with an MOI of 100 VGC/cell resembled what was observed for HAE inoculated with MOIs of 0.1 to 0.001 VGC/cell at 26 to 28 days p.i. the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) was measured by using an epithelial volt-ohm meter (Millipore) on the indicated days p.i., the HAE culture membranes were sectioned, fixed, and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. images were taken with a Nikon 80i fluorescence microscope at a magnification of 60. HBoV1 apical infection of primary HAE was persistent. progeny virions were secreted from both the apical and basolateral surfaces. however, whether HBoV1 infects primary HAE remains elusive. HBoV1 infects polarized primary HAE from the basolateral surface of the HAE culture. TEER was measured every 2 days using an epithelial volt-ohm meter. images were taken with an Eclipse C1 Plus confocal microscope. basolaterally inoculated HAE dropped gradually and reached values of 400 cm2 at 15 days p.i., a level which was seen slightly earlier (13 days p.i.) this result is consistent with the viral release kinetics. HBoV1 infection disrupts the epithelial barrier. HBoV1 infects polarized primary HAE at a low MOI at both the apical and basolateral surfaces. mature and uninjured airway epithelia are mitotically quiescent (1% of cells dividing) (31\u201333) we also observed a nondividing status of the polarized primary HAE and the HBoV1-infected cells in it. HBoV1 progeny virions were collected from apical washes of purified ALI-infected primary HAE culture. the cultures were incubated at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2 for 2 h. the production of progeny virions was monitored daily by collecting samples from both the apical and basolateral chambers of the HAE culture. an HBoV1 stock was prepared by collecting apical washes of HBoV1-infected HAE. an aliquot of 200 l PBS was added to the apical chamber of the ALI culture. apical washes and collected basolateral medium were quantified for virus production. the final TEER of all of the inoculated HAE cultures had declined to a value of less than 400 cm2, an 2- to 3-fold decrease compared to that of the mock-infected HAE. the degree of airway epithelial damage at the end of infection, shown as the thickness of the epithelium and the presence of cilia, correlated with the MOI of input viruses. orescence analysis showed disassociation of the tight junction protein zona occludens-1 (ZO-1) (30) and (iii) staining showed nucleus enlargement at late infection (Fig. 3, DAPI [4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole] staining. early following infection, NS1-expressing cells predominantly contained little or no -tubulin IV. nuclei stained with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI; blue). HBoV1 is capable of infecting primary HAE from the basolateral surface. progeny virions were secreted from both the apical and basolateral surfaces. apical viral secretion increased slowly but reached a peak of 5 107 VGC/l. progeny virions were also released from the basolateral surface following the basolateral inoculation but at a level of 1 log less than the amount released from the apical surface. HBoV1 infection of HAE from the basolateral surface is persistently productive, similar to what was observed following apical infection. infected HAE on the membrane were fixed and costained with anti-HBoV1 NS1 and anti-tubulin IV antibodies or with anti-HBoV1 NS1 and anti-ZO-1 antibodies. at 22 days p.i., we performed a histology analysis of basolaterally inoculated HAE. the infected HAE also showed nuclear enlargement at late-stage infection. basolateral infection is persistently productive, causes loss of the cilia, and ultimately disrupts the tight junction barrier of the epithelium. basolateral infection suggests that HBoV1 viremia (8, 11) may facilitate viral infection over the entirety of the lung airways in patients."}
