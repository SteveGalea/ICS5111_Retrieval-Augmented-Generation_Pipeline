{"summary": "VSV is an enveloped, bullet-shaped virus with a negative, single-stranded, single-stranded, 11,161-bp RNA genome encoding 5 proteins. recombinant VSV can accommodate large or multiple foreign gene inserts in its genome. recombinant VSV can accommodate large or multiple foreign gene inserts in its genome. a single case of encephalitis in a Panamanian boy associated with VSV Indiana infection has been documented [17]. research objectives have shifted towards developing VSV with decreased virulence for use as a human vaccine vector [7,8,21\u201324] these attenuated VSV can undergo a single or multiple rounds of infection and viral transcription, however, possibly inducing neurotoxicity. pUbEm, pCMV-R8.91 and pMD.G were provided by Dr. Yasuhiro Ikeda. influenza viruses and reverse genetics H1N1 influenza viruses A/Puerto Rico/8/34 (PR8) and A/Nonthaburi/102/2009 were prepared from embryonated chicken eggs. pVSV-P was constructed by inserting the mCherry gene from pmCherry-C1 into XhoI and NheI sites. pVSV-P-HN, pVSV-P-HA1 and pVSV-P-HA7 were generated by insertion of HN (amplified from NDV strain LaSota), pdm/09 H1 HA (amplified from A/Nonthaburi/102/2009 mCherry gene was replaced by HN, H1 or H7 HA to generate VSV-P-HN, VSV-P-HA1 and VSV-P-HA7 respectively. clone expressing emerald fluorescent protein was examined by fluorescence imaging. percentages of infected cells were calculated from the ratios of mCherry-expressing cells to total cell number. mCherry-expressing cells were infected with either VSVs or VSV-Ps at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. gene (forward primer 5\u2019 CAGCTCTTCTGCTCAGATCCACCAG 3\u2019) and beginning of the M gene (reverse primer 5\u2019 TTCAGACCGAGAGAATCTTCTTTAAGGAACTC 3\u2019) were detected using specific primers. in vivo studies All procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee, Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University, Thailand. microneutralization assay Sera from immunized mice were serially diluted in 96-well plates before being mixed with 100 TCID50 of each influenza virus. the virus\u2013antibody mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and added to monolayers of MDCK cells seeded in 96-well plates. plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h then washed, and media with 2 g of TPCK-trypsin HK-P were grown in DMEM (Pan Biotech, Germany) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) pUbEm, pCMV-R8.91 and pMD.G were provided by Dr. Yasuhiro Ikeda (Mayo Clinic, USA) pVSV-P was constructed by inserting the mCherry gene from pmCherry-C1 into XhoI and NheI sites. pVSV-P-HN, pVSV-P-HA1 and pVSV-P-HA7 were generated by insertion of HN (amplified from NDV strain LaSota), pdm/09 H1 HA (amplified from A/Nonthaburi/102/2009 mCherry gene was replaced by HN, H1 or H7 HA to generate VSV-P-HN, VSV-P-HA1 and VSV-P-HA7 respectively. clone expressing emerald fluorescent protein was examined by fluorescence imaging. cells were harvested, fixed in 4% formaldehyde and subjected to flow cytometry analysis using the Cytomics FC 500 MPL (Beckman Coulter, USA) percentages of infected cells were calculated from the ratios of mCherry-expressing cells to total cell number. cDNA synthesis were designed to bind to the end of N gene (forward primer 5\u2019 CAGCTCTTCTGCTCAGATCCACCAG 3\u2019) and beginning of the M gene (reverse primer 5\u2019 TTCAGACCGAGAGAATCTTCTCTAAGGAACTC 3\u2019 as the forward primer and 5\u2019 ATGCTAGCTTATATACAAATAATAGTGCACC 3\u2019 as the reverse primer) virus neutralization titer was defined as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum which completely inhibited the agglutination of red blood cells. microneutralization assay Sera from immunized mice were serially diluted in 96-well plates before being mixed with 100 TCID50 of each influenza virus. the virus\u2013antibody mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h then washed. the genome to prevent virus replication would impair the virus\u2019 ability to induce neurotoxicity. to first engineer the attenuated VSV, we excised the P gene from the VSV genome with EcoRV. three of the fragments, minus the P gene fragment, were self-ligated and the mCherry gene was inserted between the G and L genes. the plaques were detected 48 h post-infection compared to 24 h post-infection for VSV. these data indicated that the P-gene deletion substantially impaired virus growth in vitro. the survival rate of mice injected with VSV-P was significantly greater. all mice injected with VSV-P survived and showed no outward signs of neurovirulence. all mice injected with VSV-P survived. BHK-P cells were infected with VSVs at an MOI of 0.01. supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points for plaque assays. values are averages of triplicate wells with error bars showing SD. VSV-HA7 and VSV-P-HA7 contained the HA gene in their viral genomes. incorporation of foreign glycoproteins on the viral surface suggested that the presence of HN or HA did not block viral assembly. -HA1 or VSV-HA1 generated virus neutralizing antibody titers at 160\u2013640 and HAI titers at 1,280\u20132,560 and 640\u20132,560, respectively, against the pdm/09 strain A/Nonthaburi/102/2009 (H1N1) however, cross-reactivity was not observed against heterologous influenza viruses such as PR8 and H7N9. immunization with VSV-P expressing HA induced anti-HA IgG, neutralizing antibodies and HAI titers to the corresponding HA. the absence of P and the presence of G which might interfere with the immune induction, did not affect HA immune induction efficacy. emerald (BHK-P cells) and mCherry (VSV-P-infected cells) proteins exhibited impaired replication in normal cells with less than 0.05% fluorescent cells detected among infected cells. in contrast, almost 100% of BHK-P cells were infected. intracranial injection showed decreased neurovirulence of VSV-P. mice were intracranially injected with 1104 pfu of the VSVs. mice injected with VSV-P had no significant weight loss. VSV and VSV-P expressing HN incorporated HN on their viral surface. NA activity was detected as early as 24 h post-infection. supernatants were harvested at indicated time points. ified VSVs subjected to RT-PCR using primers specific for the N/M fragment or H7 HA genes. supernatants were harvested at the indicated time points for plaque assays. values are averages of two independent experiments with error bars showing SD. A.U., arbitrary units. immunization with VSV-P expressing HA did not disrupt viral replication compared to the respective parental strain. these viruses expressed foreign glycoproteins on the viral surface. this is relevant for eliciting immune responses to the foreign antigen HA. pdm/09 H7N9 PR8 VN HAI VN HAI VN HAI VSV-P 0 0 0 VSV-P-HA1 160\u2013640 1280\u20132560 0 0 0 VSV-P-HA1 160\u2013640 640\u20132560 0 0 0 VSV-P-HA7 0 0 160\u2013320 320\u2013640 0 0 VSV-HA7 0 0 320\u2013640 640 the P gene encodes a multifunctional protein that plays a major role in polymerase activity by protecting L from proteolytic degradation [31], supporting efficient nascent RNA encapsidation by binding to newly synthesized N [32], and promoting viral RNA synthesis by interacting with the terminal sequence of the viral genome [33]. the generation of VSV-P has been previously reported. VSV-P replicated efficiently in BHK-P cells, but its yield was still lower compared to its VSV counterpart. this difference was expected, as levels of P expression in the cell line were likely lower compared to its counterpart. VSV-P-HA was shown to express H1 HA on the viral surface by Western blot analysis. however, we could not observe the hemagglutination activity of VSV-P-HA. this was also observed in a previous study using VSV expressing HA of WSN influenza virus. VSV-P-HA expresses HA on its surface but is unable to replicate in normal cells. it behaves similar to a virus-like particle except for the presence of an RNA genome. activation of TLR3 and/or TLR7 could have enhanced maturation of dendritic cells and cytotoxicity of natural killer cells."}
