{"summary": "IBDV is a nonnveloped, icosahedral virus with a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome consisting of two segments, segment A (3.2 kb) and segment B (2.8 kb) VP4 inhibits the expression of type I interferon (IFN) by binding to the glucocorticoid-induced leucine zipper (9). so far, three putative IBDV receptors on host cells have been identified. IgM in chicken B lymphocytes (11), integrin in mouse NIH 3T3 cells (12) and HSP90 (heat shock protein 90) in chicken fibroblasts (13). surface HSP90, a highly conserved molecular chaperone, can be present inside the cell. c-Src kinase is a multifunctional nonreceptor tyrosine kinase involved in regulating a diverse spectrum of biological activities. a number of viruses, including herpes simplex virus 8 (human herpesvirus 8 [HHV8]), japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) and bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) stimulate c-Src phosphorylation to facilitate c-Src is phosphorylated at Y416 and Y527 (27) under basal conditions, c-Src is phosphorylated at Y527. intermolecular autophosphorylation of this site promotes kinase activity. IBDV activates c-Src kinase via an integrin pathway but not HSP90. c-Src Y416 phosphorylation/activation in a virulence-dependent manner. c-Src kinase is characterized by the intermolecular autophosphorylation of tyrosine 416 in the activation loop. c-Src expression and its tyrosine phosphorylation at the activation-related Y416 site were examined by Western blotting of the IBDV-infected c-Src y416 phosphorylation induced by heat-inactivated IBDV. chickens were challenged with two IBDV strains, a very virulent strain (vvIBDV) and an attenuated IBDV strain (aIBDV) the strains were harvested and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. in aIBDV-infected BFs, c-Src Y416 phosphorylation started to decline at 2 dpi. histological sections of BFs were subjected to immune staining using specific antibodies against VP3 and chicken c-Src-phosphorylated Y416, followed by confocal image analysis. western blot analysis was performed by using antibodies against phospho-c-Src (Y416), VP3 and total c-Src. DF-1 cells were mock infected or incubated with live IBDV. BFs were collected for Western blotting to analyze the phosphorylation level of c-Src. c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation leads to decreased internalization, but not adhesion, of IBDV. DF-1 cells were either mock treated or pretreated with the c-Src inhibitor AZD0530 for 1 h, prior to IBDV infection for 1 h. c-Src kinase inhibition by AZD0530 treatment led to a reduction of c-Src phosphorylation in a a significant decrease in IBDV internalization by AZD0530 treatment occurred by as early as 1 h postinfection. the effect of c-Src inhibition by treatment with AZD0530 on IBDV entry was assessed by immunofluorescence staining of the IBDV structural protein VP3. a c-Src dominant negative (DN) mutant led to a 60% reduction in virus internalization. DF-1 cells pretreated with either DMSO or different concentrations of AZD0530 were mock infected or infected with IBDV for either 1 h or 4 h. western blot analysis was then performed using anti-VP3. treated with either DMSO or 20 M AZD0530 were infected with IBDV for either 1 h, 4 h, 12 h, or 24 h. the viral titer under each condition was then measured by a viral plaque assay. integrin and HSP90 are two major IBDV binding receptors (12, 13) we screened for effective short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) by Western blotting. we confirmed the effect of shRNA knockdown of the integrin 4 or 1 subunit or HSP90 by qRT-PCR. knockdown of either the integrin 4 or 1 subunit but not HSP90 significantly reduced IBDV adhesion and internalization. IBDV-induced c-Src phosphorylation and activation are dependent on host cell surface integrin 41. lentivirus-mediated expression of integrin ITG4 shRNAs, integrin ITG1 shRNAs, HSP90 shRNA, and nontargeting EGFP shRNA as a control. shRNA-ITG4#2 (a, lane 3), shRNA-ITG1#3 (b, lane 8), and shRNA- DF-1 cells with stable expression of c-Src were infected with IBDV for 1 h. phosphorylation of c-Src was examined by Western blotting. analysis of Akt phosphorylation at S473 in IBDV-infected DF-1 cells. treatment with c-Src inhibitor AZD0530 significantly reduced Akt phosphorylation at S473. c-Src y416 phosphorylation occurs earlier than IBDV-induced Akt activation. the ratio between GTP-RhoA and RhoA was quantified from three independent experiments. DF-1 cells pretreated with the indicated inhibitors and then infected with IBDV at an MOI of 50 for 1 h. the values plotted in the bar chart were normalized to 1 for the mock treatment control. we measured the activity of RhoA GTPase by Western blotting and a G-LISA assay. a result was confirmed by a G-LISA showing that RhoA activity was upregulated by nearly 3-fold in DF-1 cells upon IBDV infection compared to that in mock-treated cells. actin rearrangement also plays a role in IBDV infection. the amount of internalized IBDV was reduced significantly in DF-1 cells pretreated with either the c-Src inhibitor AZD0530 or LY294002 prior to IBDV infection. pretreatment of host DF-1 cells with a cellular actin dynamic inhibitor, either cytochalasin D (34) or jasplakinolide (35), inhibited IBDV internalization in a dose-dependent manner. c-Src, a t c-Src kinase phosphorylation was plotted by Western blotting of the DF-1-infected or mock-infected chicken fibroblast cell line. c-Src phosphorylation at Y416 showed a rapid increase, peaked at 1 h postinfection (hpi) and decreased thereafter (Fig. 1A, middle). infected BFs were harvested and subjected to hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining and Western blot analysis of c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation at Y416. both the vvIBDV and aIBDV strains induced significant and comparable increases in c-Src phosphorylation at Y416. c-Src Y416 phosphorylation was also much more abundant in vvIBDV-infected BFs than in aIBDV-infected BFs. the intensity of c-Src kinase phosphorylation appears to correlate with the extent of virus dissemination and pathogenicity of IBDV strains. western blot analysis was performed by using antibodies against phospho-c-Src, VP3 and total c-Src. BFs were collected for Western blotting to analyze the phosphorylation level of c-Src at Y416. DF-1 cells were either mock treated or pretreated with the c-Src inhibitor AZD0530 for 1 h, prior to IBDV infection for 1 h. effect of c-Src kinase inhibition by treatment with AZD0530 on IBDV adhesion and internalization was assessed by various methods. the effect of c-Src inhibition by treatment with AZD0530 on IBDV entry was assessed by immunofluorescence staining of the structural protein VP3. in the cells at 1 hpi, VP3 was derived mostly from internalized parent IBDVs rather than from the newly synthesized progeny viruses. transfection of c-Src DN mutant led to 60% reduction in virus internalization. c-Src phosphorylation at Y416 and activation are required for IBDV entry into cells. DF-1 cells pretreated with either DMSO or 20 M AZD0530 were mock infected or infected with IBDV for either 1 h or 4 h. the effects of AZD0530 treatment on IBDV entry and IBDV binding to target cells were further assessed in parallel by using a plaque assay (F) and qRT-PCR analysis of the 5\u2032 UTR of segment A (E) the effect of the expression of c-Src DN on IBDV binding and internalization was measured in parallel by using qRT-PCR (G) and a plaque assay (H) knockdown of either the integrin 4 or 1 subunit but not HSP90 significantly reduced IBDV-enhanced c-Src Y416 phosphorylation. knockdown of either the 4 or 1 subunit of integrin led to 50% decrease in IBDV internalization. shRNA-ITG4#2 (a, lane 3), shRNA-ITG1#3 (b, lane 8), and shRNA-HSP90 (c, lane 10) effectively suppressed the expression of Flag-tagged ITG4, shRNA-ITG1 and HSP90. the knockdown of the integrin subunits chITGA4 and chITGB1 or HSP90 in the stable line was confirmed by qRT-PCR. IBDV particle adhesion and internalization assays were performed by using DF-1 cells with stable expression of shRNA against HSP90 or EGFP. all the data are presented as means SDs from three independent experiments. treatment with the Akt inhibitor LY294002 inhibited only IBDV-induced Akt phosphorylation at S473 (Fig. 4A, lane 6 versus lane 2) but had little effect on IBDV-induced phosphorylation of c-Src at Y416 (Fig. 4A, lane 6 versus lane 2). These results suggest that IBDV-induced c-Src phosphorylation is an event that occurs earlier than IB DF-1 cells pretreated with the indicated inhibitors and then infected with IBDV at an MOI of 50 for 1 h. cytoskeleton actin inhibitors cytochalasin D and jasplakinolide were then used for measuring IBDV binding and internalization. we stained cytoskeleton actin with tetramethyl rhodamine isocyanate (TRITC)-labeled phalloidin in DF-1 cells that were mock infected or infected with IBDV. this result was confirmed by a G-LISA showing that RhoA activity was upregulated by nearly 3-fold in DF-1 cells upon IBDV infection. pretreatment of host DF-1 cells with a cellular actin dynamic inhibitor inhibited IBDV internalization in a dose-dependent manner. thus, IBDV induces cellular cytoskeleton actin rearrangement for its internalization. inhibition of cytoskeleton actin rearrangement also prevents c-Src activation-mediated IBDV internalization. heat-inactivated IBDV failed to induce an increase in c-Src y416 phosphorylation. this suggests that the infectious ability of IBDV is required for its induction of c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation. this was supported by the finding that the highly pathogenic IBDV strain induced a higher level of c-Src y416 phosphorylation than did the attenuated lowly pathogenic strain there have been three reported putative IBDV receptors on host cells. they are HSP90 in chicken fibroblast (13), integrin in mouse NIH 3T3 cells (12) and IgM in chicken B lymphocytes (11) shRNA downregulation of either the 4 or 1 subunit of surface integrin but not HSP90 disrupted IBDV-induced c-Src tyrosine phosphorylation. the decrease in IBDV internalization by AZD0530 treatment occurred by as early as 1 h postinfection. however, AZD0530 treatment also yielded an even more significant decrease in virus internalization at 24 h postinfection than at 12 h postinfection. actin rearrangement can mediate membrane ruffling and blebbing and create protrusions that encompass viral particles for endocytosis. c-Src-PI3K/Akt\u2013RhoA\u2013actin signaling may have an impact on IBDV endosomal penetration to promote the release of IBDV particles from endosomes. heat-inactivated IBDV lost the ability to induce c-Src kinase phosphorylation. it is most likely that the induction of c-Src y416 phosphorylation may involve multiple components of IBDV. the major effects on the entry of IBDV into cells were attributed previously to the process of Akt phosphorylation and downstream cytoskeleton rearrangement. actin rearrangement driven by c-Src-PI3K/Akt-RhoA GTPase may also have an impact on IBDV endosomal penetration. our model favors the possibility that IBDV activates integrin-mediated c-Src kinase by specifically inducing Y416 phosphorylation of c-Src kinase. the very virulent strain and the attenuated strain of IBDV were propagated in SPF chicken embryos and DF-1 cells. all propagated virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation. all propagated virus was concentrated by ultracentrifugation. mmunoprecipitation assay (RIPA) buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.4], 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min followed by centrifugation at 12,000 g at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. blots were developed with ECL Prime Western blotting detection reagent (Amersham) the full-length cDNA of c-Src was amplified from DF-1 cells by two-step RT-PCR. the c-Src dominant mutant (39) was generated by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis using Flag\u2013c-Src as the template. shRNA targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA was used as a negative control. a shRNA targeting enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) mRNA was used as a negative control. mRNA level of chITGA4, chITGB1 or chHSP90 in knockdown DF-1 cells was further validated by qRT-PCR. monolayers of DF-1 cells in 6-well plates were mock treated or treated with chemical inhibitors for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the cells were washed 3 times with ice-cold PBS, and 2 ml serum-free DMEM was added to each well. DF-1 cells in chamber slides were incubated for 24 h with DMEM without serum at 37\u00b0C and then incubated at 37\u00b0C for another 1 h with DMSO or the chemical inhibitors AZD0530 and LY294002. the cells were fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution in PBS for 30 min, permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS after extensive washing, and stained with 50 g/ml mixed to extract the whole lysate for use as the negative control. 4 pieces of negative BFs at each time point were mixed to extract the whole lysate. the remaining BFs were fixed in a 4% formaldehyde solution. mouse anti-Flag monoclonal antibody was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.
