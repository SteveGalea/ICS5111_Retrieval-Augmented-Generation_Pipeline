{"summary": "NIH, the biomedical research arm of the federal government, should receive increased funds specifically designated for this foundational work. the administration should prioritize development and procurement of MCMs to address antimicrobial resistance, including nontraditional MCMs. the administration should continue to encourage federal scientists to identify nontraditional antimicrobials that qualify for fast-track approval, priority review, or accelerated approval pathways under the GAIN Act. the new administration should also encourage Congress to increase base funding for FDA to strengthen its Medical Countermeasure Initiative. these funds would enable the agency to grow and train its product review workforce. the administration could help bridge these late-stage gaps by increasing biodefense-related MCM funding through PAHPRA and Project BioShield. building public-private biosecurity partnerships could further strengthen research and development efforts at every point in the MCM value chain. the US government should create new opportunities for private-sector pharmaceutical companies to work with doD and NIAID to translate basic research findings into investigations, diagnostics, and prophylactics. the administration should encourage Congress to invest additional funds in creating and strengthening the infrastructure needed to conduct clinical trials efficiently during acute public health emergencies. the united states is an important donor of MCMs during international public health emergencies, but often faces a myriad of legal, logistical, and financial barriers."}
