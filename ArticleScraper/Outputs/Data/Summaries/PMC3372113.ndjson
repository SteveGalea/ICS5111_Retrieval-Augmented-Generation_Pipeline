{"summary": "the viral nucleic acids and core proteins are enclosed in an icosahedral capsid, along with the major capsid protein, hexons, and pentons. since the first isolation of adenovirus from children's tonsils in 1953, at least 51 other human serotypes have been identified. adenoviruses can cause a wide range of infections, mainly in the respiratory tract, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract and bladder, eyes, liver most of these cases were found in foreign military populations (45). in the united states, Ad14 was a rarely reported but emerging adenoviral serotype. in the united states, Ad14 was a rarely reported but emerging adenoviral serotype. cases were found by active searches by local public health doctors and passive reports from teachers, clinicians, and patients. the second section had an exposed population of 8,063, including 7,163 teaching staff and students who had close contacts with patients. 900 swimmers took part in training in the same swimming pool within 6 days (incubation, 3 to 6 days) after the first case report in the febrile respiratory disease outbreak. all patients with a clinical illness from 4 May to 31 July 2011 were required to see hospital doctors in the local children's hospital for a physical examination, X-ray scan, and blood test. the diagnosis of adenovirus infection was directly confirmed by viral isolation or PCR assay of the hexon gene. junctival fever cases from different areas were used for subtyping. 30 pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from healthy parents and from the teaching staff. nested PCR was used to detect the hexon gene of adenovirus. hexon gene type-specific primers for amplification of Ad serotype 3 were 5\u2032-GGTAGAGATGCTGTTGCAGGA-3\u2032. the reverse primer sequence was 5\u2032-CCCATCCATTAGTGTCATCGGT-3\u2032. the amplification size was 502 bp (52) the first section had a total of 505 patients ranging in age from 7 to 15 years. cases were found by active searches by local public health doctors and passive reports from teachers, local clinicians, and patients. the second section had an exposed population of 8,063, including 7,163 teaching staff and students. all patients with a clinical illness from 4 May to 31 July 2011 were required to see hospital doctors in the local children's hospital for a physical examination, X-ray scan, and blood test. the diagnosis of adenovirus infection was directly confirmed by viral isolation or PCR assay of the hexon gene. all available medical records were reviewed by 10 clinicians. a total of 15 representative swab specimens from 371 respiratory cases and 10 representative specimens from 134 pharyngoconjunctival fever cases were used for subtyping. a total of 30 pharyngeal swab specimens were collected from healthy parents and from the teaching staff. a total of 20 pharyngeal swab specimens that were Ad DNA positive were further cultured in HEp-2 cells maintained in Eagle's medium at 37\u00b0C for 14 days. the cell cultures were observed for 3 to 4 weeks. as of 31 May 2011, there were a total of 127 confirmed cases in Hangzhou. the first case was reported on 4 May 2011. the outbreak experienced three stages: the first stage was a sporadic period from 4 to 10 May. the second stage was a sustained-increase period beginning on 11 May. ang Province has 13 districts/counties, including the 8 districts of Shangcheng, Xiacheng, Jianggan, Gongshu, Xihu, Xiaoshan, and Yuhang and the 5 counties of Jiande, Fuyang, Lin'an, Tonglu, and Chun'an. the outbreak occurred in 13 of 70 schools (18.57%, 13/70) across 5 towns. a total of 371 cases were confirmed from the exposed population of the two indoor swimming pools were standard pools that were 50 m by 25 m with a depth of 2 m. the water cannot be exchanged between these two pools. no cases were found among indoor swimming pools users. population distribution in pharyngoconjunctival fever outbreak. 134 cases consistent with case definition. no professional athletes, staff, or teachers working with patients became infected. a total of 15 patients (11.81%, 15/127) were hospitalized for persistent fever. another 112 cases (88.19%, 112/127) did not need hospitalization. the ratio of hospitalized cases versus those treated but not admitted was 1:7.5 (15/112) all pharyngeal swabs were used to detect the hexon gene of adenovirus DNA. the positive rates of detection were 66.67% (10/15) and 0% (0/30) the difference between the two groups was statistically significant (2 = 22, P 0.01). adenovirus type 7 isolated from adenovirus surveillance; pink, adenovirus type 3 isolated from two outbreaks. 20 positive pharyngeal swab specimens were inoculated into HEp-2 cell cultures. the typical CPE characteristics of adenovirus were observed under an inverted microscope. the percent ILI in the entire city fluctuated approximately 2.58%. the urban ILI (2.00%) was higher than that of the suburbs. from week 17 the rate of influenza-like illness sharply increased from 0.99% to 4.95%. the outbreak attained a high peak from 7 to 10 July. there were 93 confirmed cases, accounting for 69.40% of all the cases. regional distribution in acute respiratory infection outbreak. cases in 5 towns from Chun'an County from 4 to 31 May 2011 and outbreak of 134 pharyngoconjunctival fever cases in the Xihu District of Hangzhou from 1 to 15 July 2011. all 134 patients that were positive for Ad type 3 were trained using the outdoor swimming pool. the oldest cases were 15 years old, and the youngest were 7 years of age. the age distribution was as follows: 7 years old, 0.79% (1/127); 8 years old, 11.81% (15/127); 9 years old 27.56% (15/127); 10 years old, 23.62% (30/127); 11 years old, 15.75% (20/127); 12 years old, 5.51% (7/127); 13 years old, 2.36% (3/127); 14 years old, 11.02% (14/127); the most common symptoms included fever (100.00%, 127/127), headache (46.51%, 59/127), fatigue (36.43%, 46/127), tonsillitis (30.23%, 38/127), sore throat (26.36%, 33/127), cough (20.93%, 33/127), muscle aches (3.88%, 5/127), conjunctivitis (3.10%, 4/127), and diarrhea (2.33%, 3/127). all pharyngeal swabs were used to detect the hexon gene of adenovirus DNA. the positive rates of detection were 66.67% (10/15) and 0% (0/30) in pharyngoconjunctival fever and healthy students. 98.7% to 100% nucleotide identity to a representative strain from serotype 11 was only 65.7%. samples from the two outbreaks were also tested for other pathogens known to cause acute respiratory diseases (ARDs) the rates of adenoviral DNA-positive individuals with influenza-like illness (ILI) were 44.44% (8/18), 7.69% (2/26), 0% (0/15), 17.64% (3/17), and 0% (0/14) in June, July, August, September, and October 2011, respectively. the urban ILI (2.00%) fluctuated approximately 2.58%. the dominant serotypes were Ad3a2, with occasional outbreaks of Ad3a4, Ad3a5, and Ad3a6 occurring in China between 1962 and 1988 (29). they were associated with recruits from different regions of China that were housed together for long periods of time during intense training at military training centers. however, a small number of outbreaks were reported among 15- to 25-year-old students in educational environments. most cases showed mild-moderate clinical symptoms with acute, persistent high fever and respiratory signs. laboratory testing showed that the white blood cell count was not significantly elevated during the early period, but the leukocyte and neutrophil counts increased later in 3.1% (4/127) of patients coinfected with bacteria. further PCR diagnosis from throat swabs is needed to confirm the type of virus outbreak. 70% to 80% of children under 5 years of age had antibodies against more than one adenovirus subtype. but were rarely positive for Ad types 3, 4 and 7 (1). government undertook a series of measures to protect public health. adenovirus type 3 is the major epidemic strain in Hangzhou City. adenovirus type 3 has been reported in other cities in china. adenovirus can infect humans, poultry, cattle, dog, dogs, pigs, and monkeys. adenovirus in china is not a statutorily reportable infectious disease. the virus has not been incorporated into the monitoring system. adenovirus subgroup vaccine of a different subtype has been used in the united states and other countries."}
