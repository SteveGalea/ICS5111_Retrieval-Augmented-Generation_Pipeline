{"summary": "emergency nurses are situated in the forefront of the healthcare system in combating EID outbreaks. they act as the gatekeeper of the healthcare system by identifying suspected and confirmed patients with EID infections. this task involves offering appropriate quarantine arrangements for suspected and confirmed patients in ED and allocating potential infectious patients to appropriate destinations. more than 40% of emergency nurses were not complying with the guidelines in the use of personal protective equipment. almost one-fourth of the nurses in the study (23%) had demonstrated hand hygiene practices that fell below standard. risk appraisal and perception is considered the essential constituent that mediates attitude change and navigates decision making. a significant knowledge gap exists in the understanding of emergency nurses\u2019 perceptions regarding the risk appraisal of the threat of epidemic events. the present study is part of a PhD project regarding the understanding of how emergency nurses are involved in the management of emerging infectious diseases. the qualitative descriptive approach is a research method. it aims at exploring the experiences, perceptions, and inclinations of individuals within a particular phenomenon. the qualitative descriptive design is used to generate a comprehensive summary that depicts and elicits these constituents in an explicit manner. participants who agreed to take part in the study were asked to sign an informed consent form on the date of data collection. a summary of the demographic data of the participants was presented in Table I. thematic analysis strategy consists of six primary phases: familiarizing with data; developing initial codes; identifying possible themes; (5) refining preliminary themes; (5) finalizing relevant themes; and (6) producing a scholarly report. thematic analysis strategy consists of six primary phases: (1) familiarizing with data;

(Wise et al., 2011) reported that nurses were significantly susceptible to influenza infection during the H1N1 pandemic in 2009. over half of the infections occurred in nurses, despite the fact that they had previously been trained in infection prevention. the current global phase of pandemic alert (WHO) only reflects the severity and progress seen in an influenza pandemic. there is an absence of a consensual categorization system for other EIDs, which has resulted in uncertainty and discrepancies in assessing risk and seriousness of non-influenza EID events. the findings shed some light on the importance of maintaining an optimal level of risk perception and crisis awareness among nurses during an EID event. the major limitation of the present study is that the risk appraisal of emergency nurses can only be considered as one of the factors that would affect emergency nurses\u2019 behaviours. the present study was approved by the human ethics committee of the Hong Kong polytechnic university. participants were fully informed about the background of the study and the nature of their involvement before the commencement of their participation. their consents to take part in the study and being audio-recorded were clearly solicited."}
