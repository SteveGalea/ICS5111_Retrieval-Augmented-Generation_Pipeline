{"summary": "the likelihood that amyloidosis would actually occur under physiological conditions depends largely on the amino acid composition of a protein. results The average accuracy based on leave-one-out (LOO) cross validation of a Bayesian classifier generated from 143 amyloidogenic sequences is 60.84%. the average classification accuracy for the holdout test set obtained using a decision tree is 78.64%. ered antibodies are used in a number of therapeutic procedures such as target-specific anti-cancer therapy, immunosuppression, and purging prior to bone marrow transplants. most of those antibodies are of nonhuman origin, and their administration often results in the generation of adverse immune responses. current humanization strategies include the retention of variable domains or the specificity-determining residues (SDR) only. naive Bayesian and decision tree classification methods predict amyloidogenic propensities of antibody sequences. 143 amyloidogenic antibody sequences derived from twelve different germlines were used. 158 corresponding non-amyloidogenic derivatives were used for generating the classifiers. all alignments used in this paper are hand-annotated. a holdout test set consisting of 103 amyloidogenic sequences and 28 non-amyloidogenic sequences for eight of the twelve germlines was used. the naive Bayesian method yields a prediction accuracy of 60.84% for amyloid-formers.

Decision tree was constructed in order to evaluate the contribution of a mutation to amyloidogenicity. each path leads to one of eight terminal nodes, defined as the product of the weights (in italics) along the path leading to it. an analysis of paths taken by amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic derivatives of different germlines indicated that different pairs of terminal nodes may be used to provide maximum separation between these derivatives. values were obtained by substracting the percentage of mutations in non-amyloidogenic derivatives from the percentage of mutations in non-amyloidogenic derivatives terminating in a given leaf. minimum and maximum values per germline set were shown in italics and boldface, respectively. a direct implementation of the Naive Bayesian method results in prediction accuracies between 60.84% and 81.08%. the average accuracy from this validation was at 60.84 35.96% for classifying amyloidogenic sequences, with 25.95% of the non-amyloidogenic sequences being misclassified.

N.A. non-conservative mutations account for 0.6 - 0.79 of the total mutations in V sequences, while 0.4 - 0.59 account for the mutations in V sequences. it is implied that the position of mutations plays a more important role in light chain amyloidogenic propensity, based on studies on patients with very low light chain levels. a Naive Bayesian classifier vNB is defined as: (1) where vj is one of a set of V classes and ai is one of n attributes describing an event. this approach is attractive for the current problem, where there are only two possible outcomes. prediction accuracy for derivatives of the germline X72813 did not improve significantly even after the augmentation of the data set. most of the derivatives of X72813 are implicated in light chain deposition disease. non-amyloidogenic probabilities are calculated in a similar manner, but with the use of pNAM instead of pAM. a product of the probabilities is subsequently taken; if the product of the probabilities is higher, the test sequence is classified as amyloidogenic. 'yes'/'no' paths are followed throughout the classification process. in biology, it has been used in Parkinson's disease management [40], disease severity profiling [41,42], toxicity analysis [43], large-scale proteomic studies [44,45], microarray data classification [46] and phylogenetic analysis. algorithms have since been developed for optimal tree creation [36-38] a decision tree was created to approximate the contribution of each mutation to the overall amyloidogenicity of a sequence. these results are consistent with predictions using other methods. this consistency may be viewed as a validation of our observations. the naive Bayesian method may be used for \"yes\"- or \"no\"-type predictions on the amyloidogenicity of a sequence. a caveat for both methods is the possibility of overfitting. overfitting is the description of random error, instead of true correlations. 143 amyloidogenic and 158 non-amyloidogenic derivatives of the germlines were obtained from the national center for biotechnology information. resulting alignments were manually annotated. the non-amyloidogenic derivation sets were constructed from randomly chosen derivatives of each germline. the probability p of a mutation occurring at position x was quantified for both amyloidogenic (pAM) and non-amyloidogenic (pNAM) derivatives of the same germline. raw values of pAM and pNAM can take the value of 0; to avoid this, we used the Laplace correction method. FR residues are generated for alignments of amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic derivatives, based on the algorithm described in [22]. exposure information was generated for each alignment using structural homologues of the germline sequence. a binary matrix containing mutations exclusive to amyloid-formers was also generated. tracing the path through the tree that describes each mutation yields a score, s, calculated as the product of the weights along the path. mutations from amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic derivatives of a single germline are organized into separate matrices that factor in location, exposure and sheet-forming propensity into account. s corresponds to scores of individual mutations and n corresponds to the number of mutations in a sequence. amyloidogenic sequences are expected to have higher AMseq values. cross-validation was performed on the holdout test set. the probability p of a mutation occurring at position x was quantified for both amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic derivatives of the same germline. the probability p of a mutation occurring at position x was quantified for both amyloidogenic (pAM) and non-amyloidogenic derivatives of the same germline. mutation matrices are generated for alignments of amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic derivatives. exposed residues were defined as residues having 25% accessible surface. exposure information was generated for each alignment using structural homologues of the germline sequence. a binary matrix containing mutations exclusive to amyloid-formers was also generated. tracing the path through the tree that describes each mutation yields a score, s, calculated as the product of the weights along the path. mutations from amyloidogenic and non-amyloidogenic derivatives of a single germline are organized into separate matrices that factor in location, exposure. s corresponds to scores of individual mutations, and n corresponds to the number of mutations in a sequence. s is amplified in certain paths, amyloidogenic sequences are expected to have higher AMseq values."}
