{"summary": "the role of CXCL10 in viral pneumonia has not been thoroughly characterized. evidence suggests it is important for the migration of NK cells, macrophages, T cells, neutrophils and plasmacytoid dendritic cells into the lung. synergistic induction of CXCL10 has been described with IFN in conjunction with HIV-1 in human astrocytes and macrophages. this marked variety of pro-inflammatory molecules that elicit a synergistic response of CXCL10 in a wide variety of cell types is indicative of a highly conserved and likely biologically important cellular response. protease-dissociated HBE cells were plated on Transwell\u00ae chambers. they were maintained in immersed culture conditions until they reached confluence. cells were maintained at ALI for 7 days and were placed in basal media devoid of additives. mice were used at 8\u201310 weeks of age. all protocols described were approved by the university of California, Davis and University of Arizona. mice were anesthetized with isoflorane in dorsal recumbancy. dsRNA and/or 5 g of recombinant murine IFN in 50 l of LPS free PBS was deposited and breathed in. lungs were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA isolation. the primer sequences for human and murine CXCL10 were purchased from SA Biosciences. the primer sequences for human beta actin are as follows: forward: TCCTCCACCTTTGACGCTG and reverse: CCCTCTCTGTGTAGCC. cells were plated onto 12 well plates at 80\u201390% confluency. the next day, cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM (Invitrogen) before transfection. transfected cultures were treated with 50 ng/ml IFN and/or 25 g poly I:C. no tissues from patients diagnosed with lung-related diseases were used. all those lungs were either autopsy leftovers or were rejected for transplant. no identity link to the actual patient can be identified. mice were purchased from Charles Rivers Laboratories and used at 6\u20138 weeks of age for intra-tracheal instillations. the wild-type controls mice were C57BL/6J. all protocols described were approved by the University of California, Davis and University of Arizona. cells were treated with 50 ng recombinant murine IFN and/or 25 g dsRNA for 24 hours. mice were anesthetized with isoflorane in dorsal recumbancy. lungs were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen for subsequent RNA isolation. the purity of the amplified product was determined as a peak of the dissociation curve. there was no observable fluctuation in the Ct values of the housekeeping genes from different treatment conditions. primers to human and murine CXCL10 were purchased from SA Biosciences. pRL-TK was used as the internal control for normalizing transfection efficiency. cells were plated onto 12 well plates at 80\u201390% confluency. cells were washed twice with Opti-MEM before transfection. well differentiated HBE cells showed significant synergistic induction of CXCL10 mRNA following influenza virus infection and treatment with IFN. CXCL10 induction was significantly elevated following the combined treatment of MEM and IFN treatment as compared to the treatment with IFN alone. dsRNA, IFN and dsRNA in HBE cells showed synergistic induction of CXCL10 mRNA in a time dependent manner starting as early as 3 hours after treatment. treatment resulted in significant synergistic induction of CXCL10 mRNA levels. triplicate wells were used for each experiment and experiments were repeated at least three times using cultures derived from different donors. p0.05 compared to either IFN or dsRNA treatment alone. synergistic stimulation of CXCL10 gene by IFN and dsRNA is independent of the type I interferon pathway. dsRNA is known to induce the type I interferon pathway. we isolated MTE cells from IFNAR null mice. monoclonal neutralizing antibody IFNAR (Grey bar) for one hour prior to the addition of 50 ng/ml IFN and/or 25 g/ml dsRNA for 24 hours. RNA was isolated followed by qPCR. NS: not significant. CXCL10 promoter-reporter gene activity in response to 50 ng/ml IFN and/or 25 g/ml dsRNA (dsR) for 24 hours. no synergism was observed despite activation of STAT1A and STAT1B. NFB-dependent signaling is responsible for the synergism between IFN and dsRNA (dsR) well differentiated primary HBE cells were treated with 50 ng/ml IFN and/or 25 g/ml dsRNA for 24 hours. RNA was isolated followed by qPCR. influenza virus in combination with IFN synergistically induces CXCL10 mRNA and protein production from primary human airway epithelial cells. well differentiated primary HBE cells were treated with 50/ml IFN and/or 1200 HAU MEM influenza virus for 24 hours. significant levels of CXCL10 were also released basally. the levels were much lower than the apical secretions. synergy between influenza infection and IFN treatment may be caused by the interaction between dsRNA- and IFN-mediated signaling pathways. IFN and dsRNA treatment together synergistically induced CXCL10 mRNA 54 fold in mouse lung. results demonstrate synergistic induction of CXCL10 protein in vivo. induction of CXCL10 by dsRNA alone was significantly impaired in the MTE cells from IFNAR null mice. dsRNA-induced CXCL10 appeared to depend on the type I interferon receptor, suggesting that the synergy may be mediated via a different pathway. synergy occurred at transcriptional level by transfection of the HBE cells with a CXCL10 promoter/luciferase chimeric construct containing 735 bp of the upstream regulatory region of CXCL10. synergistic stimulation of CXCL10 was mediated by NFB pathway because both sites were present in this cloned CXCL10 promoter region. the combined treatment resulted in much greater degradation of IB. despite the activation of STAT1A and STAT1B by these treatments, no synergism was observed. the synergism of IFN and dsRNA on CXCL10 expression was mediated. airway epithelial lining is the first defense against respiratory viral infection. this is the first report documenting the observation and mechanism underlying the synergism between IFN and viral infection (or dsRNA treatment) keratinocytes, macrophages, endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells induction of CXCL10 in a variety of systems [7], [8], [9], [12]. Several studies have demonstrated that the transcription factor, NF-B, is involved in CXCL10 induction in a variety of systems [7], [8], [9], [12].. dsRNA was used extensively as a synthetic dsRNA to model viral infections. but it can also be involved in synergistic induction of CXCL10 in airway epithelial cells. this fact could be an important consideration in the treatment of patients with pre-existing diseases such as viral infections. study has been carried out to demonstrate the involvement of NFkB, but not STAT1 in this synergism. this capacity for airway epithelial cells to up-regulate CXCL10 likely has important consequences for CD8+ T cell migration to the airway epithelial microenvironment following influenza virus infection."}
