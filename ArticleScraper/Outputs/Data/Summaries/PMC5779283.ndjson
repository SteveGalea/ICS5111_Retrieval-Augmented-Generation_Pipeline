{"summary": "1, 2 Antigenic and genetic analysis of influenza A (H3N2) viruses indicate that influenza viruses continually circulate in Southeast Asia via a network of temporally overlapping epidemics that seed viruses in temperate regions. 5, 6, 7 Influenza surveillance systems with laboratory confirmation provide data to improve global antigenic forecasting and vaccine strain selection. 8, 9, 10 Access to rapid and accurate influenza laboratory diagnostics is essential to identify new influenza virus strains with pandemic potential. the public health infrastructure in Laos is in poor condition and annual health spending per capita was $85 in 2006. 17 Generally, Laos has a subtropical climate but the northern provinces and higher elevations bordering China and Myanmar are more temperate. 18 Influenza vaccination is not routinely available in public health care facilities in Laos. influenzalike illness was defined using the WHO case definition of fever 38\u00b0C, plus cough and/or throat pain. surveillance hospitals are centrally located and the catchment population is mainly urban residents of Vientiane. the system aimed to collect specimens from four ILI patients per hospital per week. respiratory swab specimens were collected from all eligible cases in the internal medicine, pediatric, and intensive care ward 7 days per week. patients were screened for signs and symptoms of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) in children aged 14 years, the ALRI case definition was fever 38\u00b0C on admission and cough with dyspnea, tachypnea or shortness of breath. the RVP assay uses a single primer pair targeting a conserved region of 5\u2032UTR to detect viruses of the closely related enterovirus and rhinovirus genera. the surveillance hospitals are centrally located and the catchment population is mostly urban residents of Vientiane. the number, age and gender of patients seeking outpatient care were recorded each week in the participating wards of the three sentinel hospitals. the number, age and gender of patients presenting with ILI symptoms were summarized. the data allowed monitoring overall trends in ILI activity for 2008. age and gender of patients admitted to the Internal Medicine and Pediatric wards with a preliminary diagnostic assessment suggest lower respiratory infection were recorded each day. the RNA underwent a single freezethaw cycle during analysis. a total of 541 respiratory swab specimens from ILI outpatients were received. positive specimens, 46 (511%) were influenza type B positive in 2007 and 46 (708%) were type B positive in 2008. the H3 subtype was predominant in 2007 (41/90; 456%) while the H1 subtype was more common in 2008 (17/65; 262%). coinfections with two or more viruses were found in 32% (17/526) of ILI patients. there was one coinfection of influenza A/H1 with HPMV and one coinfection with influenza B and coronavirus. 13 (72%) 3 (50%) 222 (42%) Total 127 (100%) 42 (100%) 151 (100%) 199 (100%) 18 (100%) 6 (100%) 543 (100%) all ALRI patients with influenza were 5 years of age or older. two of the influenza positive cases were from children aged 5\u201317 years. one case was also HIV positive. 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) Negative 7 (18%) 2 (29%) 2 (13%) 7 (33%) 4 (33%) 0 (0%) 22 (23%) Total pathogens detected exceed the total number of patients enrolled (n = 79) due to mixed infections. 90 (441%) of ILI patients tested positive for influenza and in 2008, 65 (202%) were influenza positive (Table 1). Among influenza positive specimens, 46 (511%) were influenza type B positive in 2007 and 46 (708%) were type B positive in 2008. influenza was detected in 9% of the 0\u20132 year age group. coinfections with two or more viruses were found in 32% (17/526) of ILI patients. there was one coinfection of influenza A/H1 with HPMV and one coinfection with influenza B and coronavirus. acute lower respiratory infection From august to December 2008 respiratory swab specimens were obtained from 88 hospitalized ALRI patients. Specimens from nine patients were excluded due to improper storage or delays in transport. four cases of triple infection with enterovirus\u2013rhinovirus and human metapneumovirus plus either adenovirus or an influenza virus. all ALRI patients with influenza were 5 years of age or older. five representative influenzapositive clinical specimens from 2007 were sent to the WHO Influenza Collaborating Center in Tokyo for viral culture, molecular and antigenic analysis. two H1N1, two H3N2 viruses and one type B virus were isolated. influenza was confirmed in 126% of hospitalized pneumonia patients. the findings are consistent with reports from elsewhere in East and Southeast Asia 5, 23, 24. ledgements support for influenza surveillance activities in Lao PDR comes from the world health organization, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, US Navy Medical Research UnitJakarta, Asian Development Bank and the Institute Pasteur. the contribution of JE Bryant was supported by Agence fran\u00e7aise de d\u00e9veloppement, SISEA/ Pasteur Project.
