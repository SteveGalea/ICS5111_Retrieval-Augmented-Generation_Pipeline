{"summary": "bioinformatic data can be used in phylogenetic analysis, as it is used in most branches of biology, such as phylogenetic trees for paralog genes [4], population analysis [5], evolution, epidemiology [6], [7], and genomic and metagenomic sequence comparison [8]. phylogenetic inference at species level is presented in the Tree of Life (ToL) Web Project. Tollip binds directly to interleukin-1 receptor-associated kinase-1 (IRAK-1) by inhibiting autophosphorylation. overexpression of Tollip leads to inhibition of TLR2, TLR4 and IL-1R signaling, confirming a modulatory role of Tollip in immune responses. anolis carolinensis acs 100562725 4.99 31238.86 54.21 79.6 0.295 Anopheles gambiae aga AGAP003615 5.37 30424.6 42.29 85.57 0.319 Apis mellifera ame 552034 5.63 31855.55 55.02 79.36 0.334 Ailuropoda melanoleuca aml 100463737 4.75 35361.18 49 85.37 0.226 Homo sapiens hsa 54472 5.68 30281.81 54.72 82.19 0.243 Ixodes scapularis isc ISCW002962 6.79 21534.59 24.65 92.49 0.073 Macaca mulatta mcc 702587 5.68 30311.83 54.72 81.82 0.252 Monodelphis domestica mdo 100011810 5.04 30174 locentrotus purpuratus spu 756664 5.61 33741.14 60.18 68.27 0.494 Tribolium castaneum tca 664056 5.9 29687.86 42.98 85.75 0.339 Taeniopygia guttata tgu 100220909 5.03 30394.82 46.29 79.34 0.268 Trichinella spiralis tsp 3457 4.78 27893.53 36.6 Tollip protein sequences previously aligned at Clustal W2 [45] were back-translated at BioEdit [46] package using standard genetic code, to normalize the codon frequencies and bring/make the comparison more accurate. tollip protein sequences previously aligned at Clustal W2 [45] were back-translated at BioEdit [46] package. the recombination was assessed using a recombination cost \u2018\u2018delta dirac\u2019\u2019 and mutation cost \u2018\u2018Hamming\u2019\u2019, implemented in the Recco program [49]. the gap extension cost was fixed to 0.2 and the statistical significance of the analysis was obtained after 1000 permutations. the evolutionary history of ToL (A), complete Tollip protein (B) and G-block cured Tollip protein (C) are shown. trees B and C are drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. the analysis involved 36 amino acid sequences. the separated groups, based in the Tollip sequence, reinforce evolutionary relatedness constructed in the ToL project. group I suggests a characteristic function of the protein in order of higher levels of organisms complexity, requiring a less stable molecule for the modulation of information. tollip participates in several immune pathways, mediated or not by Myd88 [18], [19], modulating the responses and the loss or reduction of its affinity to molecular complexes made between it and several other compounds, like IRAK-1 [20]\u2013[23], could trigger an exaggerated response of the immune system, leading to death in some cases. cular weight showed a statically significant correlation coefficient with aliphatic index. another character showed correlations between the aliphatic index and the instability index (p0.001; r = 0.5829), and between GRAVY and the aliphatic index (p0.001; r = 0.5829). protein conserved residues are disposed at (B), with variable positions as \"\" these positions reflect some essential molecular arrangement to Tollip function. the variability of sequence lengths implies a complex organization of Tollip function. the tollip has sites for ubiquitination [22], which considerably reduces its life-time. the protein contacts with G69-D74-D121-E122-R123 residues. ligand 768 contacts with E118-I131-A132-W133-L154 residues. ligand 768 is related with inhibition of calcium-dependent membrane binding activity. ligands are shown arranged at lateral chain of the right residues, Ca2+ (C) and 768 (D) ligands are shown arranged at lateral chain of the right residues, Ca2+ (C) and 768 (D) ligands are shown arranged at lateral chain of the right residues, Ca2+ (C) and 768 (D) at least 3 breaking-points with statistical significance (p0.001, KH test) were supported by Recco analysis with 1000 bootstraps and by at least four different algorithms at RDP software. the most probable hypothesis to support our findings is the horizontal transfer mediated by viruses or bacteria. oaa fca_101095614 (95.2% similarity) Unknown (api_100167693) 194\u2013528 3.2411021 (GENECONV) 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 - - 1 Figure 5. Recombinational events involved with Tollip evolution. null hypothesis of equal evolutionary rate throughout the trees was rejected at a 5% significance level (P0.05) the analysis involved 36 amino acid sequences. all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) of the tollip sequence is correlated to AD. we could infer that amino acid exchanges of A (Ala) to S (Ser) occur at residue 222. it suffers a strong positive selection, through Selecton analysis. a study involving tuberculosis and tollip [71] reveals some synonymous polymorphisms or some that occur at non-coding regions could trigger different levels of risk of TB. another SNP (rs3750920) was associated with increased levels of Tollip mRNA, providing protection to the organism against TB. in/del trends were seen as very frequent. the three dimensional structure analysis revealed the modular characteristic of this protein and the necessity of Ca2+ to keep the correct pocket of C2 domain. positively selected residues were found in almost all domains."}
