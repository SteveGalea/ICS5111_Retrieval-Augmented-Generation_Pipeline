{"summary": "the health authority has established an integrated dengue control program. the primary objective is to prevent the introduction of new dengue viruses into Taiwan. suspected cases must be reported within 24 hours of clinical diagnosis in Taiwan. more than 8,000,000 inbound travelers passed through the 2 international airports from July 2003 to June 2004. a panel of diagnostic tests, including tests for pathogens of dengue, malaria, enteric bacteria, and other diseases (such as yellow fever, plague) were performed for selected fever patients. airport fever screening picked up 40 (83.3%) of 48 of all imported cases identified by the active surveillance system. 8 imported cases were identified by other active surveillance methods. the average length between the onsets of dengue symptoms to the time of diagnosis was 4.15 days for the 40 case-patients identified at the airport. most of the confirmed cases (33 of 40) identified by airport fever screening were viremic (real-time PCR positive, IgM and IgG negative) the other 7 case-patients tested positive for dengue-specific IgM or IgG antibody, although they were febrile at the time of testing. the method requires an infrared thermal camera, which costs approximately U.S. $43,000 for each set of instruments. the reporting procedure and clinical and laboratory diagnoses are similar to those of surveillance methods. the method is cost-effective means of identifying imported dengue cases. include viral hepatitis, flavivirus infections, and rickettsial diseases."}
