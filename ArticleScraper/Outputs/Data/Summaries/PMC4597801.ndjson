{"summary": "all human cases of H7N9 virus infection were reported to the chinese center for disease control and prevention. a subset of cases reported single dates of exposure of 7, 8, 9 or 10 days prior to symptom onset. an exact date of exposure at 7 days actually indicated exposure at some uncertain time in the previous week. an incubation period between 0 and 7 days was estimated using interval-censored data. we explored the sensitivity of estimated incubation period distributions by extending the potential period of infection from 0 days to 3 days after the single-exposure date. this approach may lead to overestimation of the incubation period distribution, which tends to be right-skewed (14). all analyses were conducted using R, version 3.1.1 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) and the \u201cinterval\u201d and \u201csurvival\u201d packages in R. all human cases of H7N9 virus infection were reported to the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. an exact date of exposure at 7 days actually indicated exposure at some uncertain time in the previous week. the most basic approach to dealing with interval-exposure data is to impute the infection date as the midpoint of any exposure interval. however, this approach may lead to overestimation of the incubation period distribution, which tends to be right-skewed. a total of 438 laboratory-confirmed cases of H7N9 were reported in mainland china. of these cases, 229 patients had available data on exposure dates. the median age of the 229 patients was 58 years; 68% were male. weibull 3.4 3.0, 3.7 6.5 5.9, 7.1 8.0 7.3, 8.8 326 Gamma 3.3 2.6, 5.9 8.8 7.0, 15.1 12.8 10.4, 21.7 328 Lognormal 3.2 2.9, 3.6 7.2 6.4, 7.9 10.8 9.5, 11.9 336 Log-logistic 3.4 3.0, 3.9 7.7 6.8, 8.5 13.4 11.6, 15.3 347 Exponential 3.2 3.0, 4.9 8.9 the best-fitting parametric distribution was the Weibull distribution (AIC = 326). the gamma distribution had a very similar fit (AIC = 328), followed by the lognormal (AIC = 336) and log-logistic (AIC = 347) distributions. the midpoint approximation led to overestimation of the incubation period distribution compared with the nonparametric Turnbull estimate and the Weibull model. the mean of the empirical distribution under the midpoint approximation was 5.5 days, with a 95th percentile of 6.0 days. studies estimated the incubation period distributions indirectly, via the delay in the impact of live poultry market closures on incidence of human infections in urban areas during the first wave of the epidemic in 2013 and the second wave in 2013\u20132014. DISCUSSION Using all available data on exposures from 229 patients with laboratory-confirmed virus infection, we estimated that the mean incubation period was approximately 3.4 days. 95% of infections led to symptoms within 6.5 days. this latest estimate of the incubation period distribution is consistent with some previous estimates based on exposure data. similar observations between midpoint imputation and parametric estimates were previously observed in the case of influenza A(H5N1). despite the small number of available data, Huai et al. (26) reported an overall median incubation period of 5 days (range, 2\u20139.5 days) for a cohort of 24 patients using midpoint imputation."}
