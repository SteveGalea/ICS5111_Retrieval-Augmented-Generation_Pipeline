{"summary": "the genomes of all viruses in this superfamily are characterized by the presence of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), chymotrypsin-like protease, superfamily 3 helicase (S3H) and genome-linked protein (26). among the families in this superfamily, Dicistroviridae and Picornaviridae are two families of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses with similar gene contents but different genome organizations and hosts dogs are well-recognized reservoirs of viruses from at least seven families (42), including highly fatal viruses that can be transmitted to humans. no picornaviruses had been reported in dogs until 2011 (24, 36) RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs, fecal swabs, and urine. the RNA was eluted in 60 l of RNase-free water. RT-PCR of the 5\u2032 UTR of picornaviruses was performed using conserved primers and DNA sequencing. for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min in an automated thermal cycler. the PCR products were subjected to gel purification using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAgen, Hilden, Germany) the sequences of the PCR products were compared with known sequences of the 5\u2032 UTR of picornaviruses. the 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a SMARTer RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) the nucleotide sequences of the genomes and the deduced amino acid sequences were compared to those of other picornaviruses. a bicistronic plasmid was constructed on the backbone of pSP-FL+NF and pRL-CMV. firefly luciferase was used as the test reporter and Renilla luciferase as the control reporter. putative IRES sequences in the 5\u2032 UTR (5\u2032 IRES) and intergenic region (IGR IRES) were amplified. pRluc-IGR IRES-Fluc, intergenic region of CPDV inserted into pRluc-Fluc backbone. in vitro transcription of capped RNA was synthesized using a mMESSAGE mMACHINE kit. the pGL3-enhancer vector lacks a promoter but contains a simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer located downstream of a firefly luciferase gene. plasmid-encoded Renilla luciferase was used as an internal control to normalize variations between transfection replicates. 1 g of pGL3-enhancer experimental plasmids was independently transfected into MDCK cells with 10 ng of Renilla luciferase reporter vector as a cotransfection control. cell lysates were incubated with firefly and Renilla luciferase-specific substrates following manufacturer's instructions. the reaction mixture was subjected to thermal cycling at 50\u00b0C for 2 min and 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 55\u00b0C for 1 min. a 0.2-g volume of the amplicon was mixed with 2 l each of ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, 10 reaction buffer, and enzyme mix. a total of 368 dogs were captured from 38 different locations in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) during 22 months. RNA was extracted from nasopharyngeal swabs, fecal, urine, and blood samples. the RNA was eluted in 60 l of RNase-free water. the mixtures were amplified in 40 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 1 min, 60\u00b0C for 1 min, and 72\u00b0C for 1 min and a final extension at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. standard precautions were taken to avoid PCR contamination. the cDNA was converted to cDNA by a combined random-priming and oligo(dT) priming strategy. the 5\u2032 ends of the viral genomes were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) using a SMARTer RACE cDNA amplification kit (Clontech) the average evolutionary divergence for each coding region over the three strains of CPDV was estimated by the overall mean distance with p-distance method in MEGA 5 (50). a bicistronic Renilla/firefly dual-luciferase reporter plasmid was constructed on the backbone of pSP-FL+NF and pRL-CMV (Promega, Madison, WI) pRluc-Fluc, backbone and negative control; pRluc-HCV 5\u2032 IRES-Fluc, positive control; pRluc-5\u2032 IRES-Fluc, 5\u2032 IRES of CPDV inserted into pRluc-Fluc backbone; pRluc-IGR IRES-Fluc, intergenic region of CPDV inserted into pRluc-Fluc backbone. the bicistronic construct containing encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) IRES was used as a positive control. each IRES element was excised from the bicistronic constructs. the pGL3-enhancer vector lacks a promoter but contains a simian virus 40 (SV40) enhancer. for each IRES construct, cells were transfected in triplicate in wells of a 12-well plate. for RNA transfection, cells were transfected in triplicate in wells of a 6-well plate. 1 g of pGL3-enhancer experimental plasmids was independently transfected into MDCK cells. quantitative RT-PCR was performed on 38 positive fecal and 9 positive urine samples. reaction mixture was subjected to thermal cycling at 50\u00b0C for 2 min and 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 50 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 55\u00b0C for 1 min. the synthesized RNA was purified by lithium chloride precipitation. the concentration of purified RNA was quantified by UV light absorbance. the size of the purified RNA was assessed by running an aliquot of the purified RNA on an agarose gel. the genomes of all three strains of CPDV contain two putative IRES elements and two open reading frames (ORFs) there is 72% nucleotide identity between the 3\u2032 92 bases of 5\u2032 UTR and the 3\u2032 89 bases of IGR (from position 3864 to 3952) IRES structures of the 5\u2032 UTR (A) and the IGR (B) in CPDV are underlined. the P1 of CPDV possessed the highest amino acid identity (25.1%) to that of feline picornavirus (34).

CPDV is more related to other picornaviruses than to members of other families of viruses. phylogenetically, CPDV is more related to other picornaviruses than to members of other families of viruses. the presence of two IRES elements is genuine instead being due to artifacts. two IRES elements were observed in all three sequenced strains of CPDV. both CPDV IRESs are functional and could promote translation of structural and nonstructural polyprotein precursors from the genomic mRNA. CPDV could represent a missing link between dicistroviruses and picornaviruses. s of dicistroviruses possess two functional IRES elements, one at the 5\u2032 UTR upstream from P2 and the other upstream from VP4. the genomes of picornaviruses possess only one IRES element at the 5\u2032 UTR upstream from VP4. however, multiple steps of translocation and IRES deletion should be required for dicistroviruses to evolve to become picornaviruses."}
