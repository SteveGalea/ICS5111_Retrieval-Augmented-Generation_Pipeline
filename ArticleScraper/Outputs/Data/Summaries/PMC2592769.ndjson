{"summary": "association studies are the main tool for exploring common genetic variations underlying ALI susceptibility and/or outcome in adults. results We conducted a broad PubMed literature search from 1996 to June 2008 for original articles in English supporting a positive association (P 0.05) of genetic variants contributing to all-cause ALI susceptibility and/or outcome. hypoxemia under mechanical ventilation (arterial partial pressure of oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen [PaO2/FiO2] of less than or equal to 300 mm Hg for ALI and PaO2/FiO2 of less than or equal to 200 mm Hg for ARDS), diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiographs, and reduced lung compliance. ALI and ARDS remain a major health problem worldwide. association studies compare two groups of samples for statistical differences in the frequency of variants at one or more sites of the genome. currently, association studies in ALI have exclusively used a candidate gene approach, in which one or several genes \u2013 known to be etiologically involved in the disease \u2013 are studied. study quality \u2013 rather than significance value \u2013 was reviewed based on current recommendations. a checklist of all issues to consider in association studies would require more than a single article. each of these criteria was scored as 1 if present or 0 if absent. adequacy of case groups was considered if demographical and clinical data were reported in sufficient detail in the text and/or a table. LD must have been explored for polymorphism selection and/or for the interpretation of results. amplification primer pairs and flanking sequences were scored as present. studies designed to confirm previously associated polymorphisms were not considered acceptable for this category. studies that included experiments providing evidence of functionality for associated variants were scored as adequate. the sole reference to previous publications providing the functional evidence of the associated polymorphism was scored as absent. a reported association could have a maximum score of 14 points for case-control studies if more than one polymorphism was analyzed. a maximum of 13 points if reporting a case-control study for a single polymorphism (multiple testing adjustment not needed) or for a cohort with more than one polymorphism analyzed. scores were then transformed to a 0- to 10-point scale. testing of Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was scored as present even when significant P values were reported for any of the groups. adequate studies performed an interpretation of results blind to the clinical status of samples. this category was not scored if a single polymorphism was assessed. most studies were carried out exclusively in populations of European descent (defined as 'Whites' or Caucasians) a minority of studies were performed in East Asians (7%) and the remaining 20.7% of studies included populations of both European and African descent.
