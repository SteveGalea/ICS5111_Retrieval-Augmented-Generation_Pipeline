{"summary": "HIV entry, the first phase of the viral replication cycle, begins with the adhesion of virus to the host cell and ends with the fusion of the cell and viral membranes. virions must bind to the target cell, with this being mediated either by the viral envelope (Env) protein or host cell membrane proteins incorporated into the virion with any one of a number of different cell attachment factors. Env is a heavily glycosylated trimer of gp120 and gp41 heterodimers. gp120 contains five relatively conserved domains (C1\u2013C5) and five variable loops (V1\u2013V5) each loop is comprised of a loop structure formed by a disulfide bond at its base. coreceptor binding is widely thought to be the trigger that activates the membrane fusion potential of Env. there is no compelling evidence that coreceptors other than CCR5 and CXCR4 play important roles in supporting infection of HIV-1 in vivo. only R5 and R5X4 viruses are transmitted between individuals. a fourth step of virus entry is movement of the virus particle to the site where productive membrane fusion occurs. some viruses have been shown to \u201csurf\u201d along the cell surface, moving from distal sites of attachment to more proximal regions of the cell body where virus entry occurs. formation of the 6HB is driving force that brings opposing membranes into close apposition, resulting in the formation of a fusion pore. coreceptor binding unlocks the potential energy of the gp41 fusion complex resulting in the formation of a fusion pore. if one or multiple HIV Env trimers are needed for complete membrane fusion is not yet clear. in 1993, CD26 was reported as the elusive HIV coreceptor. in 1995, Feng and colleagues identified CXCR4 as a major HIV coreceptor. ccr532 has an allelic frequency of 10% in Caucasians. several 32 homozygotes have been infected with X4 viruses. enfuvirtide is a 36-residue-long peptide whose sequence is based on that of the HR-C in gp41. enfuvirtide is a highly specific and effective membrane fusion inhibitor. maraviroc is a small-molecule allosteric inhibitor that binds within the CCR5 transmembrane cavity. similar CCR5 small-molecule inhibitors are in various stages of testing. increased structural detail continues to provide insight into the HIV entry process. both chemokines and Env have been reported to engage CCR5 and CXCR4 in a two-site model with the chemokine receptor amino terminus as site one and the extracellular loops as site two. the crystal structure provides high-resolution insight into the ECL2 binding site. all five structures portray CXCR4 as a homodimer. gp120 has two key interactions with coreceptor. the base of the V3 loop binds to the amino-terminal domain of the coreceptor. the tip of the V3 loop binds to the second extracellular loop. the structure of the CXCR4 dimer is from coordinate file 3ODU. many viruses require delivery by the host cell into an acidic, intracellular compartment. the fact that HIV does not require low pH does not imply that fusion occurs at the cell surface. miyauchi et al. tracked the location of virus membrane fusion in HeLa cells overexpressing CD4, CCR5 and CXCR4. they found that content mixing only occurred in intracellular perinuclear compartments and thus concluded that complete fusion requires endocytosis. the site of entry is more likely to have an impact on the likelihood of a productive infection actually occurring. in vivo, newly produced virions may encounter an immediately adjoining, uninfected cell. in some cases, transfer of virus from one cell to another is a specialized process, as in the case of dendritic cells (DCs) that are professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) that scavenge the periphery, sampling antigen. each DC can bind up to several hundred virions, most likely via a C-type lectin. after binding, the virions are endocytosed into a trypsin-resistant compartment. after DC binding to a T cell, internalized virus migrates to the DC:T-cell interface. 47 integrin has been reported to bind gp120; induce activation of LFA-1 (L2 integrin), which contributes to formation of the immunologic synapse. it is a heterodimeric protein comprised of an 4 and 7 subunit that when expressed on CD4+ T cells facilitates homing to the gut and other mucosal tissues. the structure of CD4 alone and in complex with a gp120 core fragment has been solved for HIV (Kwong et al. 1998; Huang et al. 2005) the structure of the postfusion 6HB in gp41 has also been determined. WHIM syndrome is characterized by warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis (retention of neutrophils in the bone marrow) the identified homodimer interface may represent a novel CXCR4 or potentially CCR5 drug target. further structural studies are needed to better define the precise interactions of Env and coreceptor. your browser is not supporting the HTML5 video> element.

HIV can actively surf along the cellular membrane from filopodia or microvilli to the cell body. this actin-dependent process requires receptor engagement and serves to enhance infection efficiency. it may bring the virus to a membrane region that has higher levels of coreceptor or downstream signaling molecules. DCs capture and concentrate virions in trypsin-resistant compartments. CD4+ T cells, containing membrane protrusions, bind DCs. each DC can bind up to several hundred virions. each DC can bind up to several hundred virions. new advances in electron microscopy have enabled 3D (three-dimensional)-structural studies of the infectious synapse that have shed light on this mechanism. integrin has been reported to bind gp120; induce activation of L2 integrin; and then augment infection efficiency in vitro. 47 is thought to bind an LDV tripeptide motif on the second variable loop (V2) of gp120, with this resulting in lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) activation. blockade of 47 with monoclonal antibodies or a peptide delays replication of HIV in vitro. recruitment of the Src-family protein tyrosine kinase Lck to the immunological synapse results in phosphorylation of immunoreceptor-tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR- subunit recruit the Syk-family protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, which in turn phosphorylates the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76. HIV gp120 was able to arrest the migration of primary activated CD4+ T cells in the presence of ICAM-1. signal transduction through CD4 and Lck was subsequently found to be responsible for depletion of cortical F-actin underneath the virological synapse. these studies suggest that Env signaling through CD4 may play a role in HIV entry under physiological conditions. chemokine mutants abolished the ability to mobilize intracellular Ca2+. neither of these interventions blocked the ability of HIV to enter cells. signaling was dispensable for viral infection and replication in target cells. a second series of experiments from Harmon and colleagues (2010) showed that HIV also signals through the Gq subunit. Rac and the tyrosine kinase Abl then become linked to the Wave2 complex through the adapter proteins Tiam-1 and IRSp53. these experiments suggest a critical role for envelope-coreceptor signaling-induced actin remodeling during HIV entry. recruitment of the Src-family protein tyrosine kinase Lck to the immunological synapse results in phosphorylation of immunoreceptor-tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR- subunit recruit the Syk-family protein tyrosine kinase ZAP-70, which in turn phosphorylates the scaffold proteins LAT and SLP-76.
