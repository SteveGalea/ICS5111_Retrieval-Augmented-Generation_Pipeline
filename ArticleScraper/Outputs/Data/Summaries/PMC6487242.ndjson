{"summary": "we collected 300 tissue specimens, including the trachea, bronchi, lungs, and kidneys from some four commercial chicken farms. we tested these tissue specimens by the real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and gel-based PCR. we selected some PCR positive samples for isolation in the embryonated chicken eggs. the virus is a highly contagious respiratory viral disease of chickens of all ages. the virus belongs to the order Nidovirales, family Coronaviridae, and genus Gammacoronavirus. the virus is a positive sense RNA molecule with a high tendency to frequent changes and recombination. many IBV strains and serotypes have emerged since its discovery. the misuse of the vaccines complicates the evolution and emergence of new IBV strains. study aimed for isolation and molecular characterization of the IBV circulating strains of the IBV in al-Hasa in the eastern region of Saudi Arabia. this region is one of the major hubs for intensive poultry production in Saudi Arabia. this region is one of the major hubs for intensive poultry production in Saudi Arabia. no Type Date of collection Age/days Signs Number of chicken Organs Farm No. 1 B 10/2015 14-21 RS 40 Lu, T, K 4 2 B 11/2015 14-21 RS 15 Lu, T, K 10 3 L 2/2016 14-21 RS 25 Lu, T, K 9 Total 100 300 B=Broiler, L=Layer, RS=Respiratory signs, Lu=Lung, T=Trachea, K=Kidney Isolation of IBV through eluted viral RNAs were stored at 80\u00b0C for further testing. the positive control was processed in parallel to each batch of specimens. the reactions were conducted as per the kit\u2019s instructions. reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) reaction mixture consists of 10 l of 5reaction buffer, 2 l of each primer, 2 l of enzyme mixture, 2 l of dNTP mixture, 3 l of the RNA template, and 4 l of RNase-free water. electrophoresis of 10 l of each PCR product was performed on 1% agarose gel. phylogenetic analysis We constructed the tree based on the obtained partial IBV-ORF1-a, IBV-N, and S1 gene sequences. we constructed the tree using the multiple alignments of these sequences with other IBV sequences retrieved from the GenBank done using the mega-7 package. phylogenetic analysis was done by the maximum likelihood method using the best-fit model determination and at least 500 bootstrap replicates as previously described. we used 9-11 days\u2019 chicken embryos from native breeds (non-IBV vaccinated) and proved to be IBV-negative antibodies by ELISA. the inoculum was prepared as follows; tissue suspensions were centrifuged for 15 min. any early deaths within 24 h post-inoculation were excluded due to non-specific trauma-related death. the total viral RNAs were extracted from tissue using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen cat. NO. 52906 Qiagen, Germany) the nucleotide sequences of the used IBV-N gene are IBV-NF (5\u2019-CGCTGGAGAATTTCCTCTCTTG-3\u2019) and the IBV-NR (5\u2019-CTAGTCCCTAGCAGCCATGC-3\u2019) the reaction mixture consists of 10 l of 5reaction buffer, 2 l of each primer, 2 l of enzyme mixture, 2 l of dNTP mixture (400 M of each dNTP), 3 l of the next-generation sequencing We processed a confirmed PCR-ECE-P3-IBV isolate for sequencing by the Illumina next-generation sequencing approach. phylogenetic analysis We constructed the phylogenetic tree based on the obtained partial IBV-ORF1-a, IBV-N, and S1 gene sequences. we used the best-fit model determination and at least 500 bootstrap replicates as previously described. chicken trachea shows congestion and hemorrhage of the tracheal mucosa and presence of hemorrhagic plug at the tracheal lumen. chicken infected with IBV showed congestion, swollen, and distinct lobos on the necropsy examination. we investigated four IBV outbreaks across the al-Hasa province by the RT-PCR. 11 tracheal tissue specimens of 20 were positive, 6 lung specimens of 20 were positive. meanwhile, only two specimens from the kidneys were positive. isolation from inoculated kidney tissues from farm no. 3 was not successful. the IBV-infected tracheal specimen caused death and induced some pathological changes in two embryos from the inoculated embryos in the three passages. the IBV-infected lung tissue specimens showed that only one embryo was affected per each passage. results show that 6/9 (66.67%) of the three tested specimens representing embryonated eggs passages 1-3 were positive. three specimens from selected IBV specimens were positive, as shown in Figure-2. phylogenetic tree of the obtained partial Saudi IBV-ORF-1a gene isolated from al-Hasa region 2015-2016. the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was based on the partial IBV-N gene. the bootstrap is 1000. the reported local IBV sequences clustered together with other IBV strains from the UK. enetic analysis based on the generated IBV-S1 sequences of our isolates confirmed the blast results. a pairwise distance analysis of partial S1 gene for the circulating IBV strains in some chicken farms in al-Hasa region 2015\u20132016. 0.28 0.29 0.25 0.22 0.21 0.27 0.13 0.27 0.19 0.19 GI.21/Spain/DQ064806 0.27 0.28 0.25 0.28 0.28 0.21 0.21 0.21 0.22 0.24 0.27 0.27 0.27 0.19 0.19 0.19 GI.21/Spain/DQ064806 0.27 0.28 0.25 0.28 0.21 0.21 0.21 0.22 0.24 0.27 0.28 0.36 0.35 0.27 GI.25/ IBV infection in chickens produces a wide range of clinical syndromes. some birds showed respiratory manifestation in terms of. edema of the lungs, cloudy or fibrinous inflammation of the air sacs, occasionally contains a yellow caseous exudate. postmortem lesions of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)-infected chickens in al-Hasa region 2015-2016. only two specimens from poultry farm on the farm no: 9 were positive of 15 tested specimens (13.33%) RT-PCR tested samples from chickens across al-Hasa 2014-2016. tracheal tissue specimens of 20 were positive, 6 lung specimens of 20 were positive. the second specimen was collected from positive IBV-RT-PCR lungs from chicken farm no. 7 area. isolation from the inoculated kidney tissues from farm no. 3 was not successful. RT-PCR amplification for three representative specimens from the ECE passages P-1-3. we already included six original specimens from the IBV-suspected outbreaks. we already included the vaccine as a positive control of the reaction. phylogenetic tree based on the partial IBV-S1 genes revealed that these strains were closely related to other IBV strains from Taiwan and Italy. the evolutionary relationship analysis based on the generated IBV-N gene sequences confirmed the S1-based analysis. the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was based on the partial IBV-N gene. the bootstrap is 1000. the reported local IBV sequences clustered together with other IBV strains from Taiwan and China.
