{"summary": "Molecular diagnostics enable sensitive detection of respiratory viruses. but their clinical significance remains unclear in pediatric lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI) the primary outcome was life-threatening disease. four rural, periurban, and urban hospital sites enrolled children in 3 provinces in south africa from february 2009 through December 2013. 2 sites were added in a fourth province (Northwest) in June 2010. a total of 24 pediatric intensive care unit beds were available across all sites. PCR data were semiquantitative and specimens with a cycle threshold (Ct) value 37 were considered positive. blood cultures were not systematically performed on all patients. HIV testing was performed on whole blood specimen or dried blood spot. results were expressed as odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) multivariate logistic regression was performed by using the manual forward stepwise procedure. a nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) in 4 mL of normal saline and a blood sample were collected from the child, ideally within 24 hours of admission but up to 7 days after onset of symptoms. children were followed up to hospital discharge. PCR data were semiquantitative and specimens with cycle threshold (Ct) value 37 were considered positive. quality control for Molecular Diagnostics external quality assessments for all viruses in the panel were performed as well as annual panels for influenza alongside live and post hoc data quality checks. results The primary outcome of this study, life-threatening disease, was defined as a composite outcome of mechanical ventilation or ICU admission. sensitivity analysis was performed using STATA/SE software, version 13.1. a separate analysis was performed for the HIV-infected population due to elevated mortality rate. coinfection was found among 23.5% of children aged 6 months and 26.4% of children aged 6 months. followed by RSV-ADV coinfection (8.3% and 23.2% in children aged 6 months and 6 months, respectively; P.001) and RSV-EV coinfection (5.6% and 11.5% in children aged 6 months and 6 months, respectively; P.001) we compared the prevalence of viruses in the presence (n = 2404) or absence of RSV (n = 7447) in the RSV-negative population, 19.3% of children hospitalized for LRTI had 2 or more viruses detected in the respiratory tract. median age for RSV monoinfection was 4.2 months (IQR, 1.9\u20139.6 months), and 6.6 months (IQR, 3.0\u201314.7 months) for RSV with any viral coinfection. 6 mo 6 mo RSV Monoinfection (n = 824) Any Coinfectiona (n = 463) P Value RSV Monoinfection (n = 506) Any Coinfectiona (n = 529) P Value Demographics Age, mo, median (IQR) 2.4 (1.3\u20133.8) 2.8 (1.9\u20134.0) 14.0 (9.0\u201322.7).05 Female sex 354/824 (43.0) 199/463 (43.0) 199/463 (43.0 underlying conditions included asthma, chronic renal failure, splenectomy/asplenia, autoimmune disease, seizure disorders, malignancy, chronic lung disease, heart failure, organ transplant, diabetes, kwashiorkor/marasmus, prematurity, valvular heart disease, immunosupressive therapy, burns, nephrotic syndrome, obesity. underlying conditions were not more prevalent in viral coinfection than in RSV monoinfection. 26 children (1.1%) were admitted to the ICU, 21 children (0.90%) needed mechanical ventilation, and 8 children died. seventeen of the 21 children (81%) who received mechanical ventilation were admitted to the ICU. we identified an increased odds of our secondary outcome for RSV-influenza when compared to influenza alone (aOR, 2.1; 95% CI, 1.0\u20134.4; P =.04) no other viral coinfections showed increased odds of severe disease compared with RSV monoinfection. all factors with P.20 were entered into the multivariate model. multivariate analysis: only factors with P.05 are shown. primary outcome data were missing for 45 RSV\u2013infected children. all factors with P.20 were entered into the multivariate model. multivariate analysis: only factors with P.05 are shown. secondary outcome was missing for 31 RSV\u2013infected children. in the HIV-infected population, 6.3% (n = 5) of children had life-threatening disease. mean RSV Ct value was significantly lower in the HIV-infected population than the HIV-uninfected population. the prevalence of any respiratory viral coinfection was more common among children aged 6 months (529 [51.1%]) compared with those aged 6 months (463 [36.0%]) the prevalence of RSV-PIV1, RSV-PIV2, and RSV-PIV3 coinfection was 1%. we compared the prevalence of viruses in the presence (n = 2404) or absence of RSV (n = 7447) in the RSV-negative population, 19.3% of children hospitalized for LRTI had 2 or more viruses detected in the respiratory tract, with the most prevalent viruses being RV and ADV. the median age for RSV monoinfection was 4.2 months (IQR, 1.9\u20139.6 months), and 6.6 months (IQR, 3.0\u201314.7 months) for RSV with any viral coinfection. age was associated with RSV and any viral coinfection in both children 6 months of age (P.001) and aged 6 months (P =.05; Table 2).
