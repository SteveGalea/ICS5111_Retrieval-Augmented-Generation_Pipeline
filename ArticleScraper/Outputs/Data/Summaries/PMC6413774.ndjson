{"summary": "asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the lung characterized by airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness and airway remodeling. however, a cellular mechanism underlying the asthmatic inflammation is not fully understood. defects in Treg generation and/or function are closely associated with uncontrolled lymphoproliferative diseases (4). mice deficient in IL-27 receptor (IL-27R) have normal Treg development (14, 17), suggesting that IL-27 plays little role in Treg homeostasis under steady state conditions. IL-27 promotes T-bet and CXCR3 expression in Tregs that are specialized in controlling Th1-mediated immunity. depleted mice fully restored IL-27\u2013mediated inhibition of allergic inflammation. IL-27 induces the lymphocyte activation gene 3 (Lag3) in Tregs (19), and Lag3 expression in Tregs was required for IL-27 to inhibit allergic inflammation. Treg-specific Il27ra\u2013/\u2013 mice develop severe allergic inflammation that is not attenuated by systemic IL-27 administration. IL-27 treatment diminished IL-4 secretion in the BALF. IL-13 is the major driver of AHR in experimental allergic airway disease. IL-13 is acting independently of IL-4 on smooth muscle and epithelial cells. mice were intranasally challenged for 4 consecutive days with CA alone or together with IL-27. starting at day 14, mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last challenge. Tregs were depleted by diphtheria toxin (DTX) injection 1 day prior to and on the first day of CA challenge. DTX-injected B6 WT mice were used as negative controls to ensure that any effects seen following DTX injection were not due to adjuvant effects of DTX. mice received 2 106 in vitro-generated Foxp3+ Tregs 2 days before antigen challenge. IL-4 and IL-13 secretion in the BALF was determined by a CBA assay. each symbol represents an individually tested animal. alone without IL-27 treatment was sufficient to reduce inflammatory CD4 T cell accumulation in the lung, cytokine secretion in the BALF, and lung inflammation. therefore, these results demonstrate that Tregs are critical players during IL-27\u2013mediated inhibition of allergic airway inflammation, raising the possibility that Foxp3+ Tregs may be the essential targets of IL-27 in vivo. transfer of WT Tregs into Il27ra\u2013/\u2013 mice diminishes allergic airway inflammation after IL-27 treatment. results suggest that Foxp3+ Tregs alone can mediate inhibitory effects of IL-27. TregIl27ra and TregWT control mice were induced for allergic airway inflammation. infiltration of inflammatory cells in the BALF was significantly elevated in TregIl27ra mice compared with that in TregWT mice. IL-27 signaling in Foxp3+ Tregs is essential for Treg function to control allergic airway infiltration. IL-27 inhibits effector T cell proliferation via Tregs. a potential mechanism by which Tregs control inflammatory responses is to suppress effector T cell proliferation. ICOS, Nrp1, CD39, and CD73 remained unchanged by IL-27 treatment. IL-27 regulates Treg functions by a mechanism independent of these molecules. IL-27 inhibits effector T cell proliferation via Treg. the proportion of proliferating CD4 T cells in the lung was comparable between WT and Il27ra\u2013/\u2013 mice. IL-27 administration did not affect T cell proliferation in Il27ra\u2013/\u2013 mice. however, adoptive transfer of WT iTregs was sufficient to downregulate CD4 T cell proliferation. lag3 expression on lung-infiltrating Foxp3+ Tregs was substantially lower in TregIl27ra compared with that in TregWT mice. IL-10 expression on lung-infiltrating effector CD4 T cells expressed comparable levels of Lag3 (Figure 6C) therefore, lag3 expression on Tregs appears essential for IL-27 to control allergic inflammation via Tregs. all the experiments were repeated more than twice. each symbol represents an individually tested animal. IL-27 stimulation of Tregs is essential for Treg functions. different susceptibility to IL-27\u2013induced STAT phosphorylation was not due to IL-27 receptor expression level. the level of the receptor expression was comparable between the groups, regardless of T cell types. however, pSTAT1 upregulation in female patient Tregs was lower when compared with that in female or male controls. IL-27 administration attenuates CA-induced allergic airway inflammation. mice were sensitized with CA in alum adjuvant and intranasally challenged with CA in the presence or absence of IL-27. cellular infiltration determined 24 hours after the last challenge. IL-27 treatment substantially diminished inflammation and mucus production. flexivent experiment further supported the IL-27\u2013mediated attenuation of the inflammation. IL-27 administration attenuates the development of allergic airway inflammation. muc5a and muc5b mRNA expression in the lung was determined by qPCR analysis. flexivent experiments measured airway resistance. each symbol represents individually tested animal. intranasal IL-27 treatment had no impact on downregulating inflammatory cell infiltration into the airways. similar treatment effects were also found in IL-4 and IL-13 secretion in the BALF (Figure 2D), as well as in lung inflammation. the failure of IL-27\u2013mediated inhibition in this condition is dependent on Tregs. in vitro generated Foxp3+ WT Tregs were adoptively transferred 1 day prior to Treg depletion. both IL-4 and IL-13 secretion in the BALF, as well as lung inflammation, were dramatically reduced. IL-27R\u2013deficient (Il27ra\u2013/\u2013) mice developed severe CA-induced lung inflammation. infiltration of inflammatory cells in the BAL and accumulation of CD4 T cells expressing inflammatory cytokines in the lung were substantially elevated in Il27ra\u2013/\u2013 mice. mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last challenge. BAL cells were examined for Ly6G and Siglec F expression. intracellular cytokine expression was determined. IHC analysis further confirmed substantial Treg accumulation in the lung of TregIl27ra mice. IL-27 treatment significantly reduced the numbers of lung-infiltrating inflammatory CD4 T cells in TregWT but not in TregIl27ra mice. these results strongly suggest that IL-27 signaling in Foxp3+ Tregs is essential for Treg function to control allergic airway infiltration. IL-27 inhibits effector T cell proliferation via Tregs. a potential mechanism by which Tregs control inflammatory responses is to suppress effector T cell proliferation (25, 26). IL-27 inhibits effector T cell proliferation via Tregs. ICOS ligand on CD11c+CD11b+ and CD11c\u2013CD11b+ cells in the lung remained unchanged by IL-27 stimulation. IL-27 inhibits effector T cell proliferation via Treg. lag3 expression on Tregs is necessary for IL-27 to suppress inflammatory responses via Tregs. IL-27 induces Treg expression of Lag3, a CD4-like molecule implicated in Treg functions. IL-27 administration significantly diminished inflammatory cell recruitment in the airway of WT Treg recipients. mice were sensitized with CA in alum and intranasally challenged. DTX was injected 1 day before and on the day of first Ag challenge. DTX was injected 1 day before and on the day of first Ag challenge. mice were sacrificed 24 hours after the last challenge. IL-27\u2013induced STAT1 and pSTAT3 phosphorylation in patient Tregs was significantly reduced compared with that in control donor Tregs. pSTAT1 upregulation in female patient Tregs was lower when compared with that in female or male controls. Tregs from asthmatic patients exhibit intrinsic defects of STAT1 and STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-27 stimulation. PBMCs collected from controls and asthmatic patients were ex vivo stimulated with or without IL-27. IL-27 signaling plays an important role in Tregs during myelin antigen\u2013reactive Th17 type autoimmune inflammation. IL-27 intranasally administered during allergen challenge greatly diminished the development of allergic airway inflammation. this unexpected finding was corroborated by the fact that the failure of IL-27 to inhibit allergic inflammation in these conditions was fully restored. the total number of lung-infiltrating Tregs was reduced after IL-27 administration. the reduction in total cell numbers may account for antigen-induced Tregs generated in vivo. both thymus-derived Tregs and in vitro\u2013generated iTregs responded to IL-27 stimulation in vitro. IL-27 induces IL-10\u2013producing Foxp3\u2013 Tr1 cells, and Tr1 cells are implicated in immune tolerance. IL-27 treatment increases the generation of IL-10+ CD4 T cells in vivo. if IL-27 is equally capable of doing so in vivo is less clear. IL-27 signals in the airways during respiratory infection, but not in effector T cells, are the main pathway through which IL-27 mediates its function in vivo. delayed production of IL-27 limits immunopathology and dampens Th1/Th17 immune responses via IL-10\u2013dependent and \u2013independent pathways. however, these reports did not identify the precise target cells of IL-27 for the protective functions. pSTAT3 axis has previously been shown to be critical for IL-27-induced proliferation (30), PD-L1 expression (32), and inhibition of inducible Treg development (31). pSTAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-27 stimulation was somewhat diminished in conventional CD4 T cells and Tregs from asthmatic patients. we are currently examining the precise source of IL-27 during CA-induced airway inflammation. our findings highlight a role of Tregs in mediating regulatory functions of IL-27 in downregulating allergic inflammatory responses.
