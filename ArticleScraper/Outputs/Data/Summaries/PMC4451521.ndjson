{"summary": "current standard care therapy for hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection consists of two regimes, namely interferon-based and interferon-free treatments. the treatment through the combination of ribavirin and pegylated interferon is expensive, only mildly effective, and is associated with severe side effects. the predicted p7 protein molecule of HCV from GT3 and GT4 provides a general avenue to target structure-based antiviral compounds. this structure-guided drug design for both GT3 and GT4 can lead to the identification of drug-like natural compounds. fda and eMEA have approved two direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) namely boceprevir and telaprevir; these NS3/4A protease inhibitors have shown promising sustained virologic response in phase III clinical trial. some combination therapies of some oral drugs have been also licensed by FDA during 2013 and 2014. the three-dimensional structure of the hexamer was generated using computational methods [18]. the recent advances in computational techniques have enabled us to build small protein molecules and portions of larger protein molecules with reasonably good resolution. p7 protein plays a crucial role in viral assembly and envelopment processes. absence of clinical efficiency with current p7 inhibitors has cast doubt over their precise antiviral effects. p7 ion channel activity has been reported in vitro with hexamethylene chloride, adamantine, as well as long chain imino sugars. present interferon-based therapy for HCV infected patients is insufficient. p7 mediates cation conductance, and is inhibited by adamantine, long alkyl chain imino sugar and amiloride in vitro. p7 is known to precisely interact with the non-structural NS2 protein, indicating that its channel activity can be regulated [30, 40]. for HCV GT3 (4 strains) are Q81495, Q81258, Q81487 and Q68801; for GT4 (7 strains) are O39929, M1VKT9, A2CJ00, Q1ZZ56, A0A023JCC8, A8S500 and A8S507; for GT5 (2 strains) are O39928 and O91936; and for HCV GT6 (5 strains) are Q5I2N3, isolate HC-JT 1b Q9WMX2 Europe Homo sapiens (Human) 747\u2013809 63 >isolate Con1 1b Q03463 Japan Homo sapiens (Human) 747\u2013809 63 >isolate HC-J1-1bALENLVILNAASLAGTRGLVSFLVFFCFAWYLKGRWVPGAAYALYGMWPLLLLLLALPPRAYA isolate HCR6 1b O9297 LVFFCAAWYIKGRLVPGATYALYGVWPLLLLLLALPPRAYA isolate BK 1b P29846 Taiwan Homo sapiens (Human) 747\u2013809 63 >isolate Taiwan-1b|P29846|747-809ALENLVVFNAASVAGMHGTLSFLVFFCAAWYIKGRLVPGATYALYGVWPLLLLLLALPPRAYA isolate BK 1b P26660 Japan Homo sap 751\u2013813 63 >isolateBEBE1-2c|Q68749|751-813ALEKLVILHAASAASSNGLLYFILFFVAAWCIKGRAVPMVTYTLLGCWSFVLLLMALPHQAYA isolate HC-J8 2c Q9QAX1 POLG_HCVVA Homo sapiens (Human) 751\u2013813 63 >isolateVAT96-2k|Q9QAX1|751-813ALE 747\u2013809 63 >isolateA2CJ00-4d|747-809LANLITINAVSVAGIHGFWHAILLICIAWHVKGRFPAAATYAACGLWPLLLLVLMLPERAYAF isolateA0A023JCC8 4d A8S500 A8S500_9HEPC Homo sapiens (Human) 747\u2013809 63 >isolateA8S500-4f|747-809EAALTNLININA -4f|747-809AALANLITINATAAVGTHGFCYAILFICVVWYIKGRGPAAAAYAACGMWPLLLLLLLLALPERAY isolateA8S507 4f O39928 New Zealand Homo sapiens (Human) 748\u2013810 63 >isolateEUH1480-5a|O39928|748-810TCKNVIVLNAAAAAGNHGFFWGLLVVCLAWHVKGRLVLVLV PRALINE multiple sequence alignment was done on the FASTA format of p7 ion channel for all genotypes by using IBIVU server. alignment was done on the FASTA format of p7 ion channel for all genotypes by using p7 ion channel. Phylogenetic tree was constructed and visualized by PhyML 3.0 and TreeDyn 198.3 programs. the approximate likelihood ratio test (aLRT) method was implemented in PhyML 3.0 and TreeDyn 198.3. superPose version 1.0 was used to analyze energy criteria of modeled proteins for genotype 3 and 4 with 3D template structure. charMM force field was applied for energy minimization to obtain a convergence gradient by using CHARMM Boundary Potential Builder [56] VEGA-QSAR models first summarize a theoretical relationship between chemical structures and biological activity in a data-set of chemicals. a virtual model for property evaluation of chemicals within global architecture-quantitative structure-activity relationship (VEGA-QSAR) program was used to analyze selected ligands. docking simulation searches for optimal binding modes to the binding site. a maximum of 10 binding modes of ligands for each p7 protein were generated by using default parameter of CLC drug discovery. the score mimics the potential energy change, when the protein and ligand come together. phylogenetic analysis The Phylogeny.fr platform [46] was used to generate phylogenetic tree of all HCV genotypes in order to find out the evolutionary relationship between them. the processing steps of multiple alignment and refinement were done by using programs called MUSCLE 3.7 and Gblocks 0.91b. the energy minimization of the modeled proteins was done by using ModRefiner [52]. the first step builds the backbone for the available C-alpha and performs energy minimization to improve the quality followed by the second step. the second step adds side chain atoms from a rotamer library. QSAR models first summarize a theoretical relationship between chemical structures and biological activity in a data-set of chemicals. a virtual model for property evaluation of chemicals within global architecture-quantitative structure-activity relationship (VEGA-QSAR) program was used to analyze selected ligands. the VEGA-QSAR models were initially derived from CAESAR models. the used input formats were SMILES and SDF files. the docking simulation searches for optimal binding modes to the binding site. p7 ion channel of GT1 shows closer similarity within different strains of subtype b. p7 from subtypes GT4 and GT5 are predicted to have maximum likeness. p7 from subtypes GT4 and GT5 are predicted to have maximum likeness. strain (isolate6a33) clustered outside, compared to subtype 6a (isolateEUHK2) and 6b (isolateTh580) GT6 subtypes are genetically very diverse, are distributed throughout the tree, and tended to be found at the base of the HCV GT4 and GT5 branches. thereby, the phylogenetic analysis of HCV p7 genotype isolates from different strains and reference strains from various other parts of the world divulg we observed less variation in residues at the C-terminal region of p7 compared to the loop region and N-terminal region in GT4 sequences. each subtype of GT4 was consistently mutated at 39 positions which could be considered novel. the BLASTp search revealed several sequences homologous to ion channel p7 GT3a and GT4a p7. the measles virus phosphoprotein (PDB code 3ZDO) was chosen as the best template for modeling the GT3 and GT4 p7 models. Fig 5 denotes the three-dimensional structure of both the GT3 and GT4 types p7 protein models. the RMSD value was calculated between the main-chain atom of the model and template, indicating close homology and ensure reliability of the p7 model. different models were tested against antiviral compounds. the selected compounds had both positive and negative predictions. the fathead minnow LC50 was predicted to be less than 6.0 [-log (mol/L)] for all selected compounds. non-mutagen Mutagen Mutagen Mutagen Carcinogenicity model Non-carcinogen NON-Carcinogen NON-Carcinogen NON-Carcinogen NON-Carcinogen NON-Carcinogen NON-Carcinogen Developmental Toxicity model Toxicant Toxicant BCF modellog(l/kg) 1.48 2.02 0.07 0.67 Ready biodegradability model NON Ready biodegradable NON Ready Biodegradable NON Ready Biode QSAR predicted values for phenol compounds used for docking analysis. the \u2018create interacting atoms group\u2019 option was used to generate a custom. atom group consisting of protein residues and molecules having at least one heavy atom within 5 of a ligand heavy atom. the loop region includes residues from 25 to 45 and the terminal regions include residues from 1\u201313 and 50\u201363 respectively. NB-DNJ formed maximum H-bonds with both GT3 and GT4 and exhibited the highest binding affinities. the best interaction observed by docking studies of NB-DNJ was with GT4 p7 residues Gly34, His31 (2), and Trp30 (2). both the C-terminal and N-terminal side regions of p7 contain potential drug interacting sites. the known antiviral drugs such as amantadine may have less binding affinity compared to BIT225 and NB-DNJ. p7 ion channel models from p7 GT3 and p7 GT4 show the interactions of flavonoids and phenols. b) BIT225, c) Hexamethylene chloride, and (d) N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin. in the GT3 p7 model, EGCG had the lowest binding energy due to binding interactions with ser44 (2), leu45 (2), Gly46, Val32, and Lys33 (2). this strong binding of EGCG may be assumed to inhibit the cell to cell spread of the virus to block the ion channeling process of p7 protein. flavonoidCompounds HCV p7 GT 3 HCV p7 GT4 Docking Score(kcal/mol) No of H bonds Interacting proteins Docking Score(kcal/mol) the docking score is lower for honokiol which formed 3 HBonds with Leu45, Ser44 (2) and Trp30 (2). nobiletin formed a higher docking score of -48.32 kcal/mol. no interaction was observed at the N- and C-terminal regions of the GT3 p7 and GT4 p7 models. interaction of p7 model between GT3 and GT4 with phenolic compounds. hydrogen bonds have been shown as blue dashed lines. current p7-based antiviral strategies p7 plays a vital role in viral assembly and discharge of mature viral particles. amantadine derivative like rimantidine for treating prophylaxis is not proposed in the country like USA [70] but studies have failed to approve the positive effect of both the interferon therapy and with IFN-/ribavirin. there is still a hope for amantadine as it inhibits p7 function in artificial membranes. the study of cell toxicity with varying drug concentrations is required in cell culture. to achieve p7 inhibition precludes a strong decision regarding the inhibitory influence of amiloride on infectious virus particle synthesized from tissue culture system. glucose-derivatives (DNJ), such as N-nonyl-DNJ, and N-butyl-DNJ, are effective inhibitors against ER -glucosidases both I and II when experimente the drug has been credited targeting p7 ion channel activity. p7 from subtypes GT4 and GT5 are predicted to have maximum likeness. p7 from subtypes GT4 and GT5 are predicted to have maximum likeness. strain (isolate6a33) clustered outside, compared to subtype 6a (isolateEUHK2) and 6b (isolateTh580) GT6 subtypes are genetically very diverse, are distributed throughout the tree, and tended to be found at the base of the HCV GT4 and GT5 branches. thereby, the phylogenetic analysis of HCV p7 genotype isolates from different strains and reference strains from various other parts of the world divulg 7, isolateA8S500, isolateA0A023JCC8, isolateQ1ZZ56, and isolateA2CJ00 varied between 73% and 77%. each subtype of GT4 was consistently mutated at 39 positions which could be considered novel. measles virus phosphoprotein (PDB code 3ZDO) was chosen as the best template for modeling the GT3 and GT4 p7 models. the atomic structure of the stable domain of the measles virus phosphoprotein had 56% identity to both the targets with query coverage of 100%. achandran plot determined that both models had approximately 95% of AAs in the favored region. less than 5% of the residues in the allowed region and 0.0% of the residues in the disallowed region. the predicted models are highly reliable for further computational studies.

NB-DNJ formed maximum H-bonds with both GT3 and GT4 and exhibited the highest binding affinities. the highest interaction energy value obtained was -45.80 kcal/mol, formed by hexamethylene chloride, due to a larger number of H-bonds formed within the carbonyl backbone and its flexible side chains. the best interaction observed by docking studies of NB-DNJ was with GT4 p7 residues Gly34, His31 (2), and Trp30 (2).

Molecular docking study of GT3 p7 model and selected drugs. p7 ion channel models from GT3 and GT4 show interactions of both flavonoids and phenols involved in inhibition. two main factors are critical to the success of a ligand-protein docking study. only apigenin and luteolin interacted with the residues in the N-terminal site of GT3 p7, forming H-bonds with protein residues Ala10 and Gly18. ladanein and naringenin exhibited high binding energy values and few interactions with the modeled HCV p7 protein. the docking score is lower for honokiol which formed 3 HBonds with Leu45, Ser44 (2) and Trp30 (2). nobiletin formed a higher docking score of -48.32 kcal/mol forming interactions with Leu45 (2), Trp30 and Ser44 (2). p7-based antiviral strategies p7 plays a vital role in viral assembly and discharge of mature viral particles. current p7-based antiviral strategies p7 plays a vital role in viral assembly and discharge of mature viral particles. some p7 inhibitors exhibiting antiviral activity in cell culture have been reported. these inhibitors include amantadine, known to inhibit the influenza A virus M2 channel [66\u201369], hexamethylene amiloride, known to inhibit HIV-1 vpu ion channel [66] and long-alkyl-chain iminosugar derivatives. amiloride categorized itself in guanidium group of compounds containing pyrazine derivative. it functions by blocking the sodium channel present in the epithelial tissue. it renders sodium reabsorption in kidney, resulting in depletion of sodium from the body without losing potassium. a new compound called NN-DNJ (UT-231B) has entered the clinical phase II study but the antiviral efficacy is not yet confirmed. BIT225 was capable to block the Vpu ion channel function by disrupting the HIV assembly with the host white blood cells. the drug has been credited targeting both HCV and HIV infection. studies have failed to approve the positive effect of both the interferon therapy and with IFN-/ribavirin [72, 73]. there is still a hope for amantadine as it inhibits p7 function in artificial membranes as well as in cell-based assay. glucose-derivatives (DNJ), such as N-nonyl-DNJ, and N-butyl-DNJ, are effective inhibitors against ER -glucosidases both I and II. compounds comprising of a DNJ header group along with long alkyl side chain are known to have dual roles inhibiting the activity of ER -glucosidases and becoming a barrier for p7 channel function. the p7 ion channel protein from HCV was modeled in the absence of any complete p7 structure. it is still assumed that the p7 folds is characterized as a hairpin. it remains indistinct regarding rearrangements of the protein structure between the monomer and hexamer forms. current advances in the field of science will hopefully pay result in the discovery of more natural compounds for use in the laboratory and clinical trials with lesser side effects. deeper biochemical knowledge of the complex p7 nature will help to describe the molecular mechanisms of ion channel."}
