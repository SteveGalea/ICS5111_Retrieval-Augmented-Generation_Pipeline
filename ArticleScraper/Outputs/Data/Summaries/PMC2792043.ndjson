{"summary": "influenza strains resistant to currently available anti-influenza drugs are increasingly isolated. this necessitates the exploration of novel anti-influenza therapies. ATA is a potent anti-influenza agent by directly inhibiting the neuraminidase. new infectious strains responsible for annual epidemics associated with significant morbidity and mortality. recent infections of humans with the highly pathogenic avian H5N1 [3] and swine-origin H1N1 [4] influenza viruses reinforce the notion that the emergence of novel virus strains is unpredictable. current vaccines are not ideal because they must be developed and validated annually [6], have lengthy manufacturing and distribution times [7] and short shelf lives [8]. resistance to both M2 blockers and NA inhibitors has been reported to be extensive [5], [14]\u2013[16]. ATA has been shown to inhibit replication of human immunodeficiency [19], [20] and vesicular stomatitis [17] viruses. ATA inhibits influenza neuraminidase, possibly elucidating its anti-influenza mechanism of action. all viruses were amplified and titrated in MDCK cells. oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was made by reverse genetics. plates were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. ATA, amantadine hydrochloride, and N-acetyl-2,3-dehydro-2-deoxyneuraminic acid were from Sigma. a neutral red assay kit was used to assess the cytotoxicity and antiviral potential of ATA according to manufacturer's instructions. DMSO concentration was the same in all treatments. incorporated dye was solubilized in 1 ml of 1% acetic acid in 50% ethanol. ATA and/or AH protection results were presented as percentage of absorbance of ATA-treated cells relative to that from untreated controls. the first step consisted of 10 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 sec, annealing at 58\u00b0C for 30 sec and elongation at 68\u00b0C for 45 sec. the second step consisted of 18 cycles under the same cycling conditions, with 5 sec added to the elongation step in each cycle. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 1 N H2SO4 prior to absorbance reading at 450 nm using a SynergyTM 2 Multi-Mode Microplate Reader. one HA unit is equal to the quantity of virus required to completely aggregate erythrocytes in an HA assay (100 l of 0.25% v/v) supernatants and lysates were incubated with 1 ml of supernatant or lysate at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. the inoculum was removed, cells were washed with PBS. cells were stained with 0.01% neutral red directly or fixed with 10% formaldehyde. cell pellets were scraped off wells and centrifuged at 1600g for 5 min. medium was discarded and cells were incubated with ice-cold fixative. cell pellets were re-suspended in 0.5 ml fixative then rinsed twice for 10 min. mixtures were incubated at 37\u00b0C with gentle agitation for 30 min. reactions were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min with gentle agitation. chemiluminescent signal measured at a rate of 1 sec/well. all viruses were amplified and titrated in MDCK cells. oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was made by reverse genetics. BS and incubated with viruses at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.001 in MEM for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were washed twice with PBS and incubated with post-adsorption medium. cells were incubated for 48 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. confluent MDCK monolayers in 24-well plates were washed twice with PBS then exposed to ATA in 1 ml post-adsorption medium for 48 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. DMSO concentration was the same in all treatments. after 48 h, neutral red dye was added to the medium in each well at a concentration of 0.033% and incubated for 2 h. RNA was amplified from 200 ng RNA in a total reaction volume of 50 l using the forward and reverse primers 5\u2032-ACTCACATGATGATCTGG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CTGCATTGTCTCTCCGAAGA-3\u2032 respectively. after an initial denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 2 min, two amplification steps were performed. ized monoclonal antibody directed against influenza A nucleoprotein (NP) washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20. wells were washed four times and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. inoculums were aspirated, cells were washed twice with PBS and treated with 1% DMSO, 100 g/ml ATA, 100 g/ml AH or 100 g/ml NAA for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. supernatants were transferred to a new tube, then cells were lysed by 2 cycles of freezing and thawing. the virus-ATA mixture was transferred to confluent cell monolayers in 6-well plates. cells were inoculated with PR8 virus for 2 h at 37\u00b0C for 2 h. cells were incubated with DMSO, 100 g/ml ATA, 100 g/ml AH. s of ATA, AH and NAA ranging from 2000 g/ml to 0.002 g/ml were prepared in NA-Star assay buffer. 25 l of each drug dilution was combined with 25 l diluted viruses. dilutions were double the final concentration. IC50 calculations were determined using nonlinear curve fit in GraphPad Prism. IC50 calculations were determined using either one-way or two-way ANOVA. ATA protects MDCK cells from influenza A strains PR8, NY or NC. MDCK cells were treated with ATA for 48 h at the indicated ATA concentrations (g/ml) cell viability was determined by neutral red assay by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. ATA reduces the level of influenza NP RNA detectable in MDCK cells. ATA reduces viral release from infected cells into the media. ATA reduces viral release from infected cells into the media. ELISA measures both infectious and non-infectious particles. cells were exposed to ATA or other previously established anti-influenza agents, AH, an M2 blocker or NAA, a neuraminidase inhibitor. ATA treatment significantly reduced both the cell-associated and extracellular virus yields when compared to either AH or NAA. cytopathic effect induced by influenza A viruses in MDCK cells reduced significantly by concomitant treatment with ATA and AH. co-treatment with ATA and AH virtually abolished H1N1 and H3N2 virus production in the media. the columns represent the means of 6 replicates and error bars represent standard deviations. not all statistically significant differences are shown. ATA inhibits influenza A and B viruses. ATA inhibited NA activity from influenza PR8, NC, NY and B viruses with IC50s of 7.2 g/ml, 16.6 g/ml, 16.4 g/ml and 6.3 g/ml. ATA significantly inhibited the enzymatic activities of two recombinant NA proteins, N1 and N4. ATA inhibits enzymatic activity of NA (A) derived from PR8, NC, NY and B viruses, (B) recombinant N1 and N4 proteins. ATA inactivates influenza WSN and H274Y viruses. 274Y viruses were pre-incubated with ATA (0, 50, 100 g/ml) for 30 min. then the virus-ATA mixture was transferred to confluent cell monolayers. ATA inhibits enzymatic activity of NA derived from WSN and H274Y viruses. ATA protects MDCK cells from infection with influenza A strains PR8, NY or NC. MDCK cells infected with influenza A viruses (MOI 0.001) were treated with ATA for 48 h. cell viability was determined by neutral red assay by measuring the absorbance at 540 nm. ATA is a potent anti-influenza agent with relatively low toxicity in tissue culture. the level of influenza nucleoprotein RNA isolated from PR8-infected MDCK cells was determined by reverse-transcription PCR. ATA reduces the level of influenza NP RNA detectable in MDCK cells. ATA reduces viral release from infected MDCK cells into the media. MDCK cells were inoculated with influenza A viruses (MOI 0.001) then treated with ATA for 48 h. media were collected and released viruses were quantified by ELISA. ATA and AH protect MDCK cells from influenza infection by reducing viral replication and release. cytopathic effect induced by influenza A viruses in MDCK cells reduced significantly by concomitant treatment with ATA and AH. the columns represent the means of triplicates and error bars represent standard deviations. not all statistically significant differences are shown. ATA inactivates influenza A and B viruses. virus, MDCK cells infected with PR8 and treated with ATA or AH, were examined by election microscopy. ATA treatment was found to induce viral aggregation on the cell surface. findings are similar to previous observations by investigators working with NA inhibitors or NA-defective particles. ATA inhibits NA enzymatic activity of NA (A) derived from PR8, NC, NY and B viruses, (B) recombinant N1 and N4 proteins. ATA inhibits replication of both WSN and H274Y viruses in a dose-responsive fashion. ATA inactivates influenza WSN and H274Y viruses. ATA inhibits enzymatic activity of NA derived from WSN and H274Y viruses. rimantidine and NA inhibitors oseltamivir and zanamivir can reduce the duration of flu symptoms. but a single mutation can render influenza viruses resistant to antiviral drugs such as M2 blockers or NA inhibitors [36] and drug-resistant influenza strains have been isolated from patients receiving antiviral treatment [15], [16], [37]\u2013[39]. these findings necessitate the exploration of novel anti-influenza agents. ATA has complicated the elucidation of its antiviral mechanism. we present evidence suggesting that the antiviral activities of ATA could be attributed to the inhibition of the viral neuraminidase. ATA substantially inhibited the enzymatic activities of both viral and recombinant NA. the IC50 and selective index are higher than those reported by Hung et al. [45] but we suspect that such discrepancies might be due to differences in experimental conditions. inhibition of influenza by ATA and AH is mediated by two distinct mechanisms, but not surprising that we observed additive effects upon simultaneous treatment with both compounds. infusion of ATA was well tolerated in a dose of up to 1 mg/kg/hour for 2 weeks. a single ATA dose of 340 mg/kg in NMRI mice was associated with LD50. mice had a median life span of 18 days upon intra-peritoneal administration of 31 mg/kg/day."}
