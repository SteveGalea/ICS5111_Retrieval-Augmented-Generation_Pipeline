{"summary": "the virologic and clinical features of HCoV infection in immunocompromised children have not been compared to those in nonimmunocompromised children. the prevalence of LRTD and severe LRTD did not differ greatly between the immunocompromised and nonimmunocompromised patients. a copathogen and host factors, including an immunocompromised state, were associated with increased risk for severe LRTD. HCoV was identified in clinical nasal samples using a multiplex respiratory PCR assay. the patients underwent respiratory viral testing as clinically indicated at the time of their evaluation. nonimmunocompromised children could have other types of underlying disorders. any virus or bacteria in nasal samples detected by multiplex respiratory PCR at presentation was considered to be a respiratory copathogen. study design We retrospectively identified all pediatric patients who presented to Seattle Children\u2019s Hospital for acute care. HCoV was identified in clinical nasal samples using a multiplex respiratory PCR assay. the patients underwent respiratory viral testing as clinically indicated at the time of their evaluation. in immunocompromised children, the highest daily steroid doses and lowest cell counts in the 2 weeks before HCoV infection were recorded. logistic regression modeling was used for exploratory analyses to investigate associations between viral strain and primary outcomes. RESULTS Patient and Viral Characteristics We identified 1308 patients with a first episode of HCoV infection. after excluding 71 patients whose respiratory viral tests were performed after hospitalization, 1237 patients were included in the final analyses. of these, 85 were immunocompromised and 1152 were nonimmunocompromised. 0 (0) 18 (2) Reason for immunocompromised state Solid organ transplant 16 (19) \u2014 Hematopoietic cell transplant 16 (19) \u2014 Hematologic malignancy/ solid tumor 43 (51) \u2014 Chronic use of immunosuppressive agents 10 (12) \u2014 Primary immunodeficiency 6 (7) \u2014 Initial treatment location Emergency department 70 (82) 798 (69) Urgent care center 1 (1) 200 (17) Clinic 5 (6) 43 (4) Outside hospital 9 (11) 111 (10) Clinical presentation the number of patients (1237) did not equal the sum of detections for each human coronavirus strain (1272) at the time of presentation, 2 strains were detected in 31 patients, and 3 strains were detected in 2 patients. at the time of presentation, no respiratory symptoms were noted in 140 (11%) children. upper respiratory tract infection was the most common diagnosis in immunocompromised (36%) and nonimmunocompromised (46%) children. risk factors for LRTD and Severe LRTD Younger age, male sex, presence of an underlying pulmonary disorder, and detection of a respiratory copathogen were associated with an increased likelihood of LRTD or severe LRTD. es and Demographic and Clinical Covariates (N = 1237) Covariates Children With LRTD Children With Severe LRTD % of LRTD (95% CI) OR (95% CI) P % of severe LRTD (95% CI) OR (95% CI) P Age.01.55 1 y (reference) 29 (25\u201333) 10 (8\u201313) 1\u20135 y 28 (24\u201332) 1.0 (0.7\u20131.3) 12 (5\u201327) 1.3 (0.4\u20133.7) Respiratory copathogen(s)a.01.01 HCoV only (reference) 19 (16\u201322) 8 (6\u201310) RSV present 62 (54\u201369) 6.9 (4.8\u20139.9).01 29 (22\u201336) 4.8 (3.1\u20137.4).01 Copathogens other than RSV 30 (24\u201336) 1.8 (1.3\u20132.6) in unadjusted logistic regression models, the risks of LRTD and severe LRTD did not differ among the children with different HCoV strains. the prevalence of LRTD was consistently higher for non-HCoV patients coinfected with a non-HCoV respiratory pathogen regardless of HCoV strain. the second of these deaths was of a 7-year-old boy with a history of severe asthma who suffered from cardiopulmonary arrest. a white blood cell count was ordered for 77 of the immunocompromised patients in the 2 weeks before HCoV detection. cell counts were not associated with LRTD or severe LRTD in the multivariable model. patients with a hematologic malignancy or solid tumor made up the largest proportion of immunocompromised children. patients with a hematologic malignancy or solid tumor made up the largest proportion of immunocompromised children.

LRTD and severe LRTD were not associated with a particular HCoV strain. we did find marked seasonality of the HCoV strains. the overall seasonality trend is consistent with that shown in other reports. the presence of HCoV does not necessarily indicate its etiologic role in clinical symptoms. however, testing bias by the attending physician was still possible. a testing bias would be unlikely to alter our interpretation of the role of the immunocompromised state."}
