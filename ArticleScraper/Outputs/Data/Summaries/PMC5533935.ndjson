{"summary": "high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) belong to seven groups of viruses known to date. the most common oncogenic genotype is an obligatory intracellular virus. the exact infectious uptake of HPV16 into epithelial cells remains controversial. furin-precleaved viral particles were found to bind directly to the secondary non-HSPG entry receptor(s), thereby bypassing the necessity of HSPG interaction. a number of secondary, predominantly L1-specific receptors have been proposed that may mediate infectious uptake. vimentin is a type III intermediate filament (IF) protein and the major IF of mesenchymal cells and cells adapted to tissue culture as well as transformed cell lines. vimentin is expressed on the cell surface and in the extracellular space in several cell types. bacteria interact with surface vimentin to mediate cellular attachment. surface-expressed vimentin is a binding protein for both furin-precleaved and uncleaved HPV16-PsVs. the extracellular events preceding HPV uptake into host cells are well understood. pgsD677 cells were infected with furin-treated and untreated HPV16-PsVs. the virions were preincubated with either of the neutralizing antibodies H16.V5 and H18.J4. pgsD677 cells were virtually noninfectible by HPV16-PsVs. furin cleavage of the particles led to an approximately 40-fold increase in infection as measured by luciferase reporter gene activity. infection of CHO-K1 wild-type cells also resulted in a more robust (approximately 30-fold) increase in the presence of FPC particles. Alexa Fluor 488 succinimidyl ester (AF488)-labeled HPV16-PsVs to pgsD677 cells for 1 h at 4\u00b0C was found to be almost completely removed by treatment with trypsin-EDTA but not with lidocaine hydrochloride-EDTA. internalization of the particles was well detected when cells were subsequently shifted to 37\u00b0C for 30 min and treated with trypsin-EDTA. vimentin received the highest protein significance score, 139. it was considered an attractive candidate involved in HPV recognition and binding due to its involvement in the attachment and uptake of several other viruses and bacteria when expressed at the cell surface. pgsD677 surface proteins bound to FPC HPV16-PsVs pulled down by the HPV16-L1-specific antibody CamVir1. pgsD677 cells were not incubated with HPV16-PsVs before immunoprecipitation. proteins were detected by Western blotting using the antibody CamVir1. surface vimentin colocalizes with HPV16-PsVs and affects viral uptake by pgsD677 cells. only a small percentage of cells presented detectable vimentin at the surface. surface vimentin modulates uptake of HPV16-PsVs by pgsD677 cells. surface vimentin modulates uptake of pgsD677 cells. 78.7% (35.1%) of uncleaved particles colocalized with vimentin. AF488-conjugated HPV16-PsVs were pretreated with soluble human vimentin protein or BSA before infection of pgsD677 cells. internalization of viral particles was assessed by flow cytometry and quantified using quadrant statistics. a Binding of the indicated virus preparations (with or without furin treatment) to approximately 50 cells per cell line was analyzed by confocal microscopy in two independent experiments. a value of 0 indicates no colocalization, and a value of 1 indicates maximal colocalization. we preincubated both untreated and FPC HPV16-PsVs with soluble human vimentin protein before infection. this led to a significant reduction in viral internalization as determined by flow cytometry. however, infectivity as measured by luciferase activity was not affected. pgsD677 cells are nonhuman and nonkeratinocytes. binding of HPV16-PsVs to HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells was found to be much higher over the entire cell population. binding of untreated and FPC HPV16-PsVs occurred at comparable extents for the individual cell systems. however, individual vimentin-positive cells showed comparable particle-binding patterns. AF488-conjugated HPV16-PsVs were pretreated with soluble human vimentin protein or BSA before infection of HeLa, HaCaT, and NIKS cells. internalization of viral particles was assessed by flow cytometry and is presented as percent change in mean fluorescence intensity of AF488-positive cells. furin pretreatment did not influence virion internalization (Fig. 4D) however, infectivity was not affected for the reasons mentioned above. we therefore altered vimentin expression in HeLa and NIKS cells by either small interfering RNA (siRNA) knockdown or overexpression. western blot of HeLa cell lysates prepared 72 h after transfection with increasing concentrations of vimentin siRNA. total vimentin was detected by the antivimentin antibody V9; glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase served as a loading control. significance was calculated by means of the two-tailed Student t test. a P value of 0.05 (*) was regarded as statistically significant. surface vimentin acts as a viral restriction factor in HPV16-PsV. identifying cell surface vimentin as a binding protein for HPV16-PsVs is widely debated. the extracellular events preceding HPV uptake into host cells are relatively well understood (4\u201313, 18\u201320) the nature of the specific entry receptor is still widely debated. pgsD677 cells and their corresponding wild-type CHO-K1 cells were infected with furin-treated or untreated HPV16-PsVs. the virions were preincubated with either of the neutralizing antibodies H16.V5 and H18.J4. Luciferase activity of the cell lysates was measured 48 h postinfection and normalized against total protein concentration. furin cleavage had a substantial functional impact on infection of the HSPG-deficient cell line pgsD677. pgsD677 cells were practically noninfectible by HPV16-PsVs. furin cleavage of the particles led to an approximately 40-fold increase in infection as measured by luciferase reporter gene activity. furin pretreatment of the viral particles affected infectivity of pgsD677 cells. this increased FPC HPV16-PsV internalization as measured by flow cytometry using AF488-labeled virions. these data confirmed that FPC HPV16-PsVs can bypass the requirement for HSPG engagement during infectious uptake, thereby permitting direct binding to the still elusive secondary receptor (17). Western blots were performed to validate the involvement of pgsD677 cell surface vimentin in FPC HPV16-PsV binding. no such protein was precipitated in the absence of FPC HPV16-PsVs. unspecific binding of the vimentin V9 antibody to the HPV16-L1 protein was excluded in appropriate control experiments. pgsD677 cells were not incubated with HPV16-PsVs before immunoprecipitation. protein bands were excised from the gel and identified by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry analysis. the leftmost lane shows molecular mass markers in kilodaltons. surface vimentin colocalizes with HPV16-PsVs and affects viral uptake by pgsD677 cells. the expression pattern of surface vimentin agrees with the literature. only a small percentage of cells presented detectable vimentin at the surface. initial (30 min) internalization of HPV16-PsVs was increased compared to untreated particles. surface vimentin modulates uptake of HPV16-PsVs by pgsD677 cells. AF488-conjugated HPV16-PsVs were used in all qualitative and quantitative assessments of infectious internalization. a subpopulation of cells (indicated by Hoechst nuclear stain, blue, column 3) (a) and colocalization analysis of cells stained with Hoechst to indicate presence of cells. signal overlays in column 4 indicate colocalization of the viral particles with cell surface vimentin as white pixels. haCaT (+HPV16-PsVs) 0.014 (0.013) 0.319 (0.195) 0.43 (0.22) HeLa (+HPV16-PsVs) 0.013 (0.011) 0.387 (0.099) 0.49 (0.19) NIKS (+HPV16-PsVs) 0.011 (0.012) 0.361 (0.105) 0.66 (0.23) NIKS (+HPV16-PsVs) 0.018 ( vimentin modulates uptake of HPV16-PsVs in epithelial cells. pgsD677 cells are nonhuman and nonkeratinocytes. pgsD677 cells are nonhuman and nonkeratinocytes. V16-PsVs occurred at comparable extents for the individual cell systems. this cell line-specific trend was also reflected at the level of luciferase activity being a readout for infectivity. however, individual vimentin-positive cells showed comparable particle-binding patterns of both untreated and FPC HPV16-PsVs. AF488-conjugated HPV16-PsVs (with or without prior furin cleavage) were pretreated with soluble human vimentin protein or BSA. internalization of viral particles was assessed by flow cytometry. this treatment led to a substantial reduction in viral internalization in all cell systems. vimentin employs toward infectious HPV particles, or by interference of vimentin with viral binding to the still-unknown entry receptor. reduced vimentin expression upon knockdown by vimentin-specific siRNA led to an increase in HPV16-PsV binding and internalization which was independent of prior furin treatment. quadrant analysis of dot plots of three independent experiments performed in triplicate is presented as x-fold change relative to the mean fluorescence intensity of cells transfected with control (scrambled) siRNA. luciferase activity was measured and was normalized against total protein concentration and is presented as x-fold change relative to cells transfected with control (scrambled) siRNA. quadrant analysis of dot plots of three independent experiments performed in triplicate is presented as percent change relative to mean fluorescence intensity of control cells infected with either furin-treated or untreated particles. the cells were transfected with 1 g of pCMV3-vim for 14 h and exposed to furin-pretreated or untreated HPV16-PsVs. virions are unable to bind to their entry receptor until they have undergone an HSPG-dependent conformational change and subsequent furin cleavage (8). virions are unable to bind to their entry receptor until they have undergone an HSPG-dependent conformational change and subsequent furin cleavage. vimentin was not found to aid in viral internalization but rather functioned as an inhibitory molecule. the presence of vimentin was not found to aid in viral internalization, but rather functioned as an inhibitory molecule. the functional significance of vimentin during natural HPV infection still needs to be elucidated. surface-expressed vimentin appears to interfere with crucial steps in the HPV16 pseudovirus infection process. vimentin is associated with several integrins, such as 6 integrin (62) vimentin is known to be associated with several integrins, such as 6 integrin (62) vimentin may act as a viral restriction factor preventing HPV16-PsV infection. the prophylactic vaccines that target certain HPV types show great efficacy (64), but they are too costly for general use worldwide. there is limited vaccine efficacy in people already infected by HPV. the spontaneously immortalized human keratinocyte cell line NIKS (ATCC CRL-12191) (58, 68, 69) was grown and maintained in F medium. all cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2\u201395% air humidified atmosphere. the protein content of the HPV16-PsV stock was quantified using a Pierce silver stain kit (Thermo Scientific) the protein content of the HPV16-PsV stock was quantified with a Pierce bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit. ischarged carbon-coated copper grid washed with 2 drops of deionized water. stained with 2 drops of 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. virions were incubated with recombinant human vimentin protein (rhVim;
