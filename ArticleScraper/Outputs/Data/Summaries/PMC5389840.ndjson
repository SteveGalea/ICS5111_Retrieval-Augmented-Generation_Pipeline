{"summary": "a self- and mutual- exciting process model was fitted to the data. results Comparable copycat effects were found on both CB and non-CB suicide news. media effects were not limited to new suicide method or celebrity suicide. media effects were observed under certain conditions, such as when the news was about celebrity suicide [3, 5], and when the news viewers shared a similar profile as the person in the suicide news [6\u20138]. the other condition is that when a new suicide method was reported in detail and portrayed as painless or being used by a celebrity, more people would kill themselves using the same method [10\u201311]. a new method by burning charcoal in a sealed room (CB suicide) was rapidly spreading in the region. in November 1998, a woman\u2019s CB suicide was reported as the first-ever publicized suicide using this method. within two years, this method became the second most frequently used suicide method in HK and raised serious public health concerns. the method was further spread to Taiwan, Japan, Korea, Singapore, and other countries. it has accounted for more than 5000 deaths up to date. no quantitative study has been done to examine the media effects in this case in HK. we first used suicide-related keywords, such as \u201csuicide\u201d and various suicide methods, to search the four newspapers\u2019 archives during Sept 1, 1998 and Dec 31, 2005. the downloaded articles were further reviewed by three trained coders to exclude those articles that are not news report of HK resident\u2019s suicide death. however, the WiseNews dataset includes neither Oriental Daily before Jan 1, 2000 nor Apple Daily before Jan 1, 1999. the following analysis was performed on each imputed dataset. the analyses were then combined to produce a final analysis using Rubin\u2019s rule. the finite order of the suicide rates and reporting intensities were estimated. ive Poisson or negative binomial regression model was not used in the present study. the self-exciting process model was also fitted to the data from three stages. previous studies found that the vast majority cases in this code are caused by charcoal burning. the WiseNews dataset includes neither Oriental Daily before Jan 1, 2000 nor Apple Daily before Jan 1, 1999. each of the articles was classified by whether or not the suicide death was reported as using the charcoal burning method. the study took into consideration some major socio-economic factors. methods and the reporting intensities by different newspapers on suicides and non-CB suicides were estimated using a nonparametric intensity estimator [26\u201328]. the analysis aimed to examine any temporal patterns of the suicide rates and reporting intensities and any relationship among those patterns. results During the study period, a total of 6958 suicide deaths occurred. 6308 suicide news articles were published, of which 23.1% were CB suicide news. overall trends of suicide rates and suicide news reporting intensities during the study period are illustrated in Fig 1. estimates of the parameters of the self- and mutual exciting process model fitted to data in whole study period and three stages. effects on Whole period Onset Stage (1998\u20132001) Peak Stage (2002\u20132004) Post-peak Stage (Post 2004) CB suicide (intercept) 1.354 (0.096) *** 1.287 (0.165)*** 1.371 (0.142)*** 1.278 (0.291)*** Unemployment rate -0.023 (0.015) -0.018 (0.020) -
