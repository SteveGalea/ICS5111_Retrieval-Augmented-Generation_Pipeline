{"summary": "RESULTS A genetic modifier locus/loci regulates B cell AICD and CD5 expression Spleen B cells from an inbred B6/129 founder line (CD22/[inbr]) and their WT littermates (WT[inbr]) mice developed into blasts at normal frequencies and proliferated similarly after ex vivo BCR ligation. spleen B cells purified from B6 (WT[B6], CD22/[B6]) or inbred B6:129 (WT[inbr], CD22/[inbr]) mice were cultured in medium alone or containing F(ab\u2019)2 anti-IgM Abs. after 48 h, the cells were analyzed for viability (7-amino-actinomycin d [7AAD] exclusion) and cell size ( spleen B cells from IgTg or IgTgsHEL mice were cultured alone or with F(ab\u2019)2 anti-IgM Abs. after 18 h, the cells were analyzed for c-Myc expression. bar graphs represent the mean (SEM) percentage of c-Myc+ B cells compared with unstimulated cultures from three mice. CD22/[F1] B cell blast development after BCR stimulation was intermediate between B cells from CD22/[B6] and CD22/[inbr] mice. CD22/[F1] and CD22/[B6] mice were subsequently crossed to generate genetically distinct CD22/[N1] littermates due to independent chromosomal segregation and crossovers between regions of heterozygous B6:129 genomic DNA. results are representative of those obtained from >40 CD22/[N1] littermates assessed in 10 independent experiments. each value represents a single mouse, with dashed boxes distinguishing between CD22/[N1] littermates having B cells sufficient in blast development (top box), or insufficient in blast development (bottom box). representative genotypes of parental CD22/[B6] and CD22/[inbr] mice are shown at the right, with green squares indicating regions of 129 homozygosity. a genetic locus regulates AICD of B cells from CD22/[N1] mice. a single locus with high logarithm of odds (LOD) scores (P 106) on the distal end of chromosome (Chr) 15 (Fig. 2 D), with four consecutive SNPs spanning the region from 68\u201391 megabase pairs (Mbp, Fig. 2 E) the increased LOD score at 91 Mbp resulted from two mice. genome and observed phenotypes were 98% (101/103) concordant in the mice. additional crossovers were observed in CD22/[N1] mice #21 and 64. a single gene was differentially expressed between mouse lines. EndoU is a gene within the Chr 15 locus that encodes a novel ssRNA binding protein. a single gene, EndoU (arrows), was differentially expressed by B cells from CD22/[B6] and CD22/[inbr] (open bars) mice. a nonspecific band (n.s.) is present in all lanes that is also observed when the secondary detection Ab is used alone as a control for total protein loading. bar graphs indicate relative B cell EndoU band densities (SEM) from three each CD22/[B6] and CD22/[inbr] mice assessed in independent experiments. bar graph shows binding of in vitro transcribed, [32P]-labeled c-Myc mRNA by recombinant EndoU protein bound to magnetic beads without EndoU (Carrier) bar graphs represent means (SEM) from three binding assays per group. results represent one of two experiments producing similar results. endoU levels were modest in activated spleen T cells from CD22/[B6] and CD22/[inbr] mice. oU overexpression required a homozygous B6:B6 EndoU locus in CD22/[B6] and IgTgsHEL mice that correlated with their characteristic AICD phenotypes. highly conserved EndoU orthologs are found in many advanced and primitive species. endoU did not cleave poly(U) ssRNAs, even in presence of Mn2+. this condition was favorable for XendoU endonuclease activity. endoU orthologs are conserved among diverse species. the region of mouse Chr 15 containing the entire EndoU locus was analyzed against the human genome using the VISTA Browser whole genome comparative analysis tool. c-Myc mRNA interactions with EndoU were examined, but mRNA cleavage was not detectable. endoU expression is low in WT and CD22/[inbr] B cells after BCR ligation. chimeric mice were then bred onto a B6 genetic background to generate EndoU/[B6] mice that were homozygous B6:B6 throughout the 93.3\u201398.3 Mbp Chr 15 region. endoU/[B6] mice do not express EndoU protein. a targeting vector was generated that contained a neomycin-resistance gene (neor) introduced into two unique BsmBI restriction sites, which introduced an in-frame termination codon. endoU protein from CD22/[inbr] and CD22/[inbr] thymocytes generates a double band (lane 4) the presence of a nonspecific band (n.s.) as also described above is indicated. endoU deficiency eliminates the anergic phenotype of CD22/[B6] B cells. all mice were homozygous (B6:B6) within the Chr 15 locus. oU/CD22/[B6] B cells from the indicated genotypes were labeled with CFSE and cultured with F(ab\u2019)2 anti-IgM Abs. after 72 h, CFSE dilution was assessed by flow cytometry analysis. values represent mean (SEM) numbers of divided cells out of 100,000 live cells analyzed for each genotype in three independent experiments. cells from both CD22/[B6] and EndoU/CD22/[B6] mice shared a surface IgMlow phenotype (Fig. 5 F) the characteristic CD5highHSAhigh phenotype of CD22/[B6] B cells was normalized in EndoU/CD22/[B6] B cells (Fig. 5 F), and CD5. 22/[B6] mice have a normal ratio of mature to immature/transitional peripheral B cells. elevated cell surface CD5 and HSA densities were phenotypic indicators for B cell AICD after BCR ligation. defining feature of IgTgsHEL mice is the paucity of anti-HEL auto-Ab production. endoU deficiency promotes auto-Ab production in IgTgsHEL mice. augmented-responder littermates were independently compared statistically with IgTg and EndoU/IgTg littermates lacking the sHEL transgene. littermate EndoU/IgTg mouse assessed at these ages (connected circles) and a WT control mouse assessed at 12 wk (diamond) are shown for comparison. 9-wk-old high-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL littermate mice (HR) are shown for comparison. endoU deficiency normalizes the phenotype of IgTgsHEL mice. high-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL mice had a marked increase in B cell blast development and c-Myc expression after BCR ligation. augmented-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL mice were phenotypically similar to IgTgsHEL mice. a-lowCD5highHSAhigh phenotype of augmented-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL B cells suggests differential sensitivities to auto-Ag exposure. blood B220+ cells isolated from IgTg and high-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL mice expressed relatively high surface IgMa levels and bound fluorescently labeled HEL protein at similar high levels. top panels show dot plots for HEL and B220 staining in the lymphocyte gate. results represent one of two independent adoptive transfers producing similar results. results represent one of two independent transfer transfers producing similar results. phenotypic similarities between CD22/[B6] and IgTgsHEL mice suggest shared genetic and signaling programs regulated B cell AICD. CD22/[B6] B cells are phenotypically similar to anergic IgTgsHEL B cells. /[B6] or CD22/[inbr] mice were measured by [3H]-thymidine incorporation. values represent mean (SEM) cpm for triplicate wells from one of three independent experiments producing similar results. bar graphs represent mean percentage of c-Myc+ B cells in BCR-stimulated cultures compared with unstimulated cultures from three mice. CD22/[inbr] mice were maintained as syngeneic brother/sister pairings for >8 yr, with genetic loci homozygous for either B6 germline DNA (B6:B6) or 129 germline DNA. B cells from CD22/[N1] mice underwent AICD (Fig. 2 B, top dot plots) or developed into blasts at substantial levels. these results confirmed the existence of a genetic modifier locus/loci that regulates BCR-induced AICD and CD5 expression. each value represents a single mouse, with dashed boxes distinguishing between CD22/[N1] littermates having B cells sufficient in blast development (top box) and CD22/[inbr] B cells (viable, gray circles) shown for comparison are the parental mouse B cells assessed in each assay as controls. all 103 mice (55 with viable B cells and 48 with apoptotic B cells) were then assessed at 0.25\u20131 Mbp resolution by PCR-based SNP genotyping within the proximal (93.3 Mbp) to distal (98.3 Mbp) region of Chr 15. a genetic locus regulates AICD of B cells from CD22/[B6] mice. a forward genetic linkage analysis was used to identify the gene locus/loci responsible parental CD22/[B6] mice were homozygous B6:B6 within the identified locus. CD22/[inbr] mice were homozygous 129:129. primary genetic element responsible for CD22/[B6] B cell AICD was located within a 24 Mbp region. 23 additional SNPs within this region at 1 Mbp intervals were genotyped in the original 44 N1 mice. bp region encodes 17 pseudogenes and 38 known genes. a single gene was differentially expressed between mouse lines. 4.4-fold higher EndoU levels in CD22/[B6] B cells compared with CD22/[inbr] B cells. values represent mean (SEM) fold changes in EndoU expression with Cd20 expression as the internal control gene in B cells from three mice of each genotype. all values were normalized relative to WT[129] B cells after BCR stimulation (dashed line) bar graphs indicate mean EndoU band densities from three each IgTg and IgTgsHEL mice as assessed in two independent experiments producing similar results. results represent one of two experiments producing similar results. shown are representative histogram overlays of immunofluorescence staining of intracellular c-Myc protein in reporter-positive cells. the percent decrease in and p-value for the reduction of mean c-Myc MFI values in EndoU-transfected cells (EndoU) relative to control-transfected cells (Vector) from four independent experiments are indicated. endoU transcripts are abundant in glucocorticoid-sensitive thymocytes undergoing apoptosis. highly conserved EndoU orthologs are found in many advanced and primitive species. endoU and representative vertebrate orthologs were extracted from Ensembl or NCBI databases. the consensus sequence at the bottom shows residues conserved in six out of seven species. asterisks indicate conserved residues within similar functional groups. c-Myc expression is reduced in CD22/[B6] and IgTgsHEL B cells. c-Myc mRNA interactions with EndoU were examined. ectopic EndoU expression in mouse NIH-3T3 fibroblasts significantly reduced c-Myc protein levels. the absence of EndoU protein in homozygous gene-targeted mice was confirmed by Western blot analysis. endoU from CD22/[B6] B cells and thymocytes migrated more slowly on SDS-PAGE gels (50 kD band) than EndoU from CD22/[inbr] thymocytes (48 kD band), due to a nonsynonymous SNP present within EndoU exon 2 endogenous 7.5 kb HindIII digested genomic DNA fragment into 8.5 kb fragment as assessed by Southern blot. results show amplification of genomic DNA from WT, heterozygous and homozygous offspring. endoU/[B6] and CD22/[B6] mice were crossed to generate double-deficient (EndoU/CD22/[B6]) progeny. c-Myc expression was also normalized in B cells from EndoU/CD22/[B6] mice with normal BCR-induced blast development. all mice were homozygous (B6:B6) within the Chr 15 locus. AICD was assessed (7AAD vs. FSC) for spleen B cells from WT[B6], EndoU/[B6], CD22/[B6], and EndoU/CD22/[B6] mice. purified spleen B cells from the indicated genotypes were cultured alone or with F(ab\u2019)2 anti-IgM Abs. after 18 h, the cells were analyzed for c-Myc or PCNA expression. the percentage of positive cells (above the dashed line) in each histogram is indicated. endoU-deficient IgTgsHEL mice produce auto-Abs. a defining feature of IgTgsHEL mice is the paucity of anti-HEL auto-Ab production. anti-HEL auto-Ab levels in high-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL mice were even greater than the levels of spontaneous anti-HEL Ab produced in IgTg mice. high serum anti-HEL auto-Ab levels developed in most high-responder mice after 5 wk of age and were maximal by 9\u201312 wk of age. high-responder littermates (HR) were independently compared statistically with IgTg and EndoU/IgTg littermates lacking the sHEL transgene. augmented-responder littermates were independently compared with IgTg mice. Means represent 3 mice assessed for each genotype in all assays. IgTgsHEL mice were compared against littermate IgTg mice. augmented-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL mice remained phenotypically similar to IgTgsHEL mice. some B cells in augmented-responder mice showed surface IgMa levels comparable to high-responder and IgTg B cells. but otherwise their B cells had reduced IgMa expression, modest blast development and c-Myc expression. Dye-labeled spleen B cells from high-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL mice maintained an IgMa-low phenotype and did not bind labeled HEL protein. there was a dramatic reduction in IgM levels and HEL-binding capacity for high-responder B cells recovered from sHEL recipients. DISCUSSION EndoU was identified in a gene modifier screen as a unique and potent regulator of B cell AICD. in WT[B6] mice, EndoU transcription and protein expression were suppressed by the balance between tonic BCR signals and their modulation by CD22. heightened BCR signals in peripheral B cells of CD22/[B6] mice drove EndoU overexpression. endoU levels remain low in WT[B6] B cells, allowing robust c-Myc expression and cell cycle progression after BCR ligation. endoU levels remain low in WT[B6] B cells, allowing robust c-Myc expression and cell cycle progression after BCR engagement. in augmented-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL mice, some B cells expressed normalized phenotypes. this suggests some B cells escape from an AICD phenotype with age to generate higher anti-HEL auto-Ab levels than IgTgsHEL mice. endoU gene has an ancient origin, with conserved orthologs found in vertebrates and invertebrates. endoU transcripts expressed in mouse B cells encoded a protein of 454 amino acids. XendoU apparently generates snoRNAs through the cleavage of pre-mRNAs encoded within introns. endoU is unique to the nidovirus family of ssRNA viruses. specific Nsp15 substrates appear to exclude the viral genome itself. mouse hepatitis virus is also a member of the nidovirus family. endoU likely regulates c-Myc and other crucial ssRNA transcripts. endoU overexpression has evolved as a checkpoint protein within the complex pathway that keeps potentially pathogenic B cells at bay through deletion via AICD. a thymidine kinase (tk) gene was inserted at the 5\u2032 end of the EndoU targeting sequence. the targeted allele generated an expected 8.5 kb band compared with the WT 7.5 kb fragment. purified spleen B cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. intracellular protein staining used either c-Myc Ab (IgG1 clone 9E10; BioLegend), followed by IgG1 secondary Abs (SouthernBiotech), or PCNA Ab (FITC-conjugated mouse PC10; eBioscience). CD22/[F1] mice were backcrossed to CD22/[B6] mice to generate syngeneic F1 progeny (CD22/[F1]). cDNA was synthesized and hybridized to GEArray NF-B signaling pathway gene arrays (SABiosciences) for real-time PCR analysis, cDNA was synthesized using random primers and analyzed using a lightCycler instrument. cDNA was quantified using EndoU exon 5 (forward) 5\u2032-CGTCAACGAGAAG-3\u2032 and EndoU exon 6 (reverse) 5\u2032-CCACATTTCAAATC polyclonal antiserum reactive with EndoU was generated using purified recombinant EndoU protein fused at the C terminus with a 6-His tag. blots were stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal ERK2 Ab (C-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to ensure equivalent sample loading. ssRNA substrates for XendoU (Laneve et al., 2008) were generated in vitro using dsDNA template oligonucleotides. full-length [32P]-labeled c-Myc mRNA was transcribed in vitro. serum anti-HEL Ab levels in mice expressing the IgTg transgene were measured using serum diluted 1:100 in Tris-buffered saline containing 1% BSA as previously described. spleen B cells (15 106) from high-responder EndoU/IgTgsHEL mice were labeled with eFluor 670 cell tracking dye. an 8 kb DNA fragment containing exons 1\u20137 was isolated from a B6 genomic BAC clone (RP24-169P4) to disrupt the EndoU gene by homologous recombination. a thymidine kinase (tk) gene was inserted at the 5\u2032 end of the EndoU targeting sequence. analysis of cell surface Ags performed by flow cytometry using fluorochrome-conjugated Abs. purified spleen B cells were cultured for 18 h in the presence or absence of F(ab\u2032)2 anti\u2013mouse IgM Ab. intracellular protein staining used either c-Myc Ab (IgG1 clone 9E10; BioLegend), followed by RPE-conjugated goat anti\u2013mouse Ig independent experiments were pooled to reduce variability between mice and experiments. CD22/[N1] mice B cell blast frequencies >1 SD above the mean percentage blasts were considered viable, while B cell blast frequencies 1 SD below the mean were considered nonviable. cDNA was synthesized using random primers and analyzed using a LightCycler Instrument (software version 3) and FastStart DNA MasterPLUS SYBR Green I kit. EndoU expression was quantified using the REST program (version 2). polyclonal antiserum reactive with EndoU was generated using purified recombinant EndoU protein fused at the C terminus with a 6-His tag. the blots were stripped and reprobed with a polyclonal ERK2 Ab (C-14; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) to ensure equivalent sample loading. the blots were reprobed using either polyclonal ERK2 Ab or polyclonal Lck Ab (2102, Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.) control-transfected reporter-positive NIH-3T3 cells were generated independently using the pECFP-N1 expression vector backbone (Takara Bio Inc.) cells with stable plasmid incorporation were selected for appropriate reporter expression in the presence of 1 mg/ml Geneticin. endoU/CD22/[B6] mice were produced by breeding EndoU/ mice with CD22/[B6] mice. they crossed heterozygous F1 animals to generate homozygous mice. IgTg and sHEL transgenes were as previously described. purified spleen B cells were analyzed by flow cytometry for blast development after 48 h of culture with F(ab\u2032)2 goat anti\u2013mouse IgM Abs. Alternatively, B cell proliferation during 72-h cultures was assessed by CFSE labeling and dilution as previously described.
