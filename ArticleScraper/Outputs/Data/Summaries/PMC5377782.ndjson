{"summary": "IFN activates hundreds of effectors, collectively known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs),2 to combat pathogen invasion (1, 2). Upon viral infection, IFN is induced, which activates hundreds of effectors, collectively known as interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs),2 to combat pathogen invasion (1, 2). LY6E expresses a higher level of LY6E in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared with healthy individuals (12\u201314) LY6E down-regulates the CD4/TLR4 signaling pathway. this partly explains its regulatory function in the immune response to pathogen infection. we examined whether HIV-1 infection in human PBMCs can induce type I IFN production and LY6E expression. we infected PBMCs with HIV-1 NL4.3 bearing VSV-G for a period of 48 h. we quantified the mRNA levels of LY6E and representative ISGs by qRT-PCR. PBMCs not infected with HIV-1 were set as a negative control. the mRNA copy number of each gene at time point 0 was set to 1. results are the means S.D. of three independent experiments. knockdown of LY6E decreased intracellular p24 level of HIV-1 by 30\u201350%. similar extents of decrease of HIV-1 infection were observed in ly6e knockdown cells. same virus stocks with equivalent amounts were also used to infect HeLa-TZM cells. p24 staining (B and C) or by RT assay (D) 55 h post-infection was determined by infecting indicator HeLa-TZM cells with equal amounts of viral stocks produced from different cell samples. results are the means SDs of three independent experiments. knockdown of LY6E shifted the HIV-1 infection peak from 7 days to 11 or 13 days post-infection. knockdown of LY6E in SupT1 cells diminishes HIV-1 spreading. ly6E protein levels in these cells are shown in Fig. 4E. entry of infectious HIV-1 bearing NL4.3 Env or VSV-G was determined by using the pLenti-puro-GFP vector. in both cases, SupT1 cells stably expressing shRNA control or LY6E were used as target cells for infection. similar results were obtained in a single-round assay using an HIV-1 lentiviral vector encoding GFP (pLenti-puro-GFP) bearing NL4.3 Env or VSV-G. we then treated SupT1 cells with phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), a chemical known to cleave GPI-anchored proteins on the plasma membrane. the inhibitory effect of LY6E knockdown on HIV-1 expression levels of CD4 and co-receptor CXCR4 on the surfaces of these target cells were examined. ly6E does not affect the Env-CD4 interaction on the cell surface. cells were spinoculated with HIV-iGFP virions at 4 \u00b0C for 1 h. they were switched to 37 \u00b0C to initiate infection. at the indicated time points, cells were trypsinized and subjected to flow cytometry. cell-cell fusion was quantified by measuring the firefly luciferase activity. despite the relatively low knockdown efficiency of LY6E in HeLa-TZM cells, we observed a 2- to 3-fold reduction in Env-mediated cell-cell fusion. LY6E Enhances HIV-1 Gene Expression To determine possible post-entry steps of HIV-1 infection that are affected by LY6E, we used an Env-defective NL4.3-based HIV-1 vector (NL4.3-KFS) (28), which allows measurement of single-round infection and gene expression when pseudotyped with VSV-G. similar results were obtained by using another luciferase-based HIV-1 vector, HIV-LTR-Luc (Fig. 6D). LY6E up-regulates HIV-1 gene expression in addition to promoting viral entry. ly6E promotes the Replication of HIV-1 AD8 in THP-1 Cells. THP-1 is a monocyte cell line that expresses a high level of LY6E (15) we then applied a lentiviral vector transduction strategy and established two stable THP-1 cell lines expressing shRNA against LY6E. the knockdown efficiency of LY6E in these THP-1 cells was similar to that observed in SupT1 cells. ly6E inhibits RT activity and viral infectivity of AD8 virus in both shRNA LY6E cell lines. the extent of the inhibitory effect of LY6E knockdown on AD8 virus was more pronounced than its effect on viral production. the up-regulation of IFN-, LY6E, and ISG15 correlated with the expression of HIV-1 Gag in infected cells. to confirm this latter effect, we treated PBMCs with interferon receptor-neutralizing antibody (-IFNRA1) for 24 h (10 g/ml) the expression of IFN-, ISG15, and LY6E induced by HIV-1 infection was completely abolished. no deleterious effect on cell proliferation was observed in LY6E shRNA-transduced cells compared with control shRNA. knockdown efficiency of LY6E was confirmed by flow cytometry using an anti-LY6E antibody. both shRNA clones reduced LY6E expression in the cell. inhibition in shRNA LY6E knockdown cells suggests LY6E does not change the HIV-1 infectivity in human PBMCs. ly6E knockdown efficiency in PBMCs was measured by flow cytometry using an anti-LY6E antibody in the presence or absence of IFN-. ly6E expression in both cell lines was reduced, i.e. 20% and 60% for C1 and C2 respectively. we infected these cells with NL4.3 bearing VSV-G and observed an 70\u201380% decrease in HIV-1 production by LY6E knockdown. knockdown of LY6E shifted the HIV-1 infection peak from 7 days to 11 or 13 days post-infection. the knockdown efficiency of LY6E protein levels in these cells is shown in Fig. 4E. the ly6E protein levels in these cells are shown in Fig. 4E. the effect of PI-PLC on entry of pLenti-puro-GFP bearing HIV-1 Env or VSV-G was determined by measuring the GFP signals of infected cells. results are the means S.D. of three independent experiments. the surface expression of LY6E is critical for this functional effect. we infected the SupT1 cells with NL4.3 and measured the Env binding to soluble CD4 on the cell surface. HIV-iGFP virions were allowed to bind to SupT1 cells expressing shRNA control or shRNA LY6E at 4 \u00b0C for 2 h. after extensive washes, GFP-positive cells were quantified by flow cytometry. 0.5 mm CPZ was applied to cocultured cells, and cell-cell fusion efficiency was determined. results are mean S.D. of three independent experiments. ly6E impedes HIV-1 uptake and Env-mediated Membrane Fusion. based on qPCR, we observed a 2- to 3-fold reduction in Env-mediated cell-cell fusion, particularly for shRNA-C2 HeLa-TZM cells. the results indicate that HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion is impaired in LY6E knockdown cells. the results indicate that hemifusion of HIV-1 Env is impaired in LY6E knockdown cells. expression of HIV-1 Gag and Env in clone 2 (LY6E-C2) decreased. knockdown of LY6E resulted in a 2- to 3-fold reduction in luciferase activity. similar results were obtained by using another luciferase-based HIV-1 vector, HIV-LTR-Luc. LY6E knockdown on luciferase gene expression was measured 48 h post-infection. an HIV-LTR-Luc vector was transfected into SupT1 cells together with HIV-1 Tat and pRLTK. cells were lysed, and firefly luciferase activity was measured 48 h post-transfection. triple knockdown of IFITM1, 2, and 3 (shRNA IFITMs) increased the RT activity and infectivity, consistent with our previous report as expected (Fig. 7B) LY6E knockdown on AD8 infectivity was more pronounced than its effect on viral production. we examined whether HIV-1 infection in human PBMCs can induce type I IFN production and LY6E expression. we observed that HIV-1 infection up-regulated the expression of IFN-, LY6E, and ISG15 after 24 h of infection. HIV-1 infection induces LY6E expression in human PBMCs. IFN- (A), LY6E (B), ISG15 (C), CXCL10 (D) and HIV-1 GAG (E) mRNA expression levels were examined. PBMCs not infected with HIV-1 were set as a negative control. treatment of cells with IFN-2b modestly up-regulated LY6E expression in PBMCs (20% increase based on geometric mean measurements) knockdown of LY6E decreased intracellular p24 level of HIV-1 by 30\u201350%. similar extents of decrease of HIV-1 infection were observed in IFN--treated LY6E knockdown cells. the fluorescence intensities of tested samples were as follows: second Ab alone, 1088; shRNA control, 3950; shRNA LY6E-C1, 1477; shRNA controlIFN, 4071; shRNA LY6E-C2, 1518; shRNA LY6E-C2, 1518; shRNA controlIFN, 4071; shRNA LY6E-C2, 1522. the viral infectivity was determined by infecting indicator HeLa-TZM cells with we infected these cells with NL4.3 bearing VSV-G. we observed an 70\u201380% decrease in HIV-1 production by LY6E knockdown. knockdown of LY6E shifted the HIV-1 infection peak from 7 days to 11 or 13 days post-infection. 5 ng of NL4.3 was used for infection, and cell supernatants were collected every 2 days, with viral production monitored by measuring the absolute RT activity. ly6E does not affect HIV-1 Binding to target cells We interrogated possible steps of HIV-1 infection that are affected by LY6E. ly6E knockdown cell lines expressing shRNA LY6E were infected with NL4.3 Env or VSV-G. flow cytometry was carried out to quantify viral uptake. similar results were obtained in a single-round HIV-1 infection assay. we infected the SupT1 cells with WT NL4.3 and measured the Env binding to soluble CD4 (CD4-Ig) on the cell surface. however, we did not observe significant differences between control and shRNA LY6E-expressing cells in HIV-iGFP virion binding. anti-CD4 and anti-CXCR4 antibodies were used as primary antibodies for flow cytometry. E, effect of LY6E knockdown on HIV-1 entry kinetics. cells were examined for GFP signals of internalized viral particle by flow cytometry. we then performed a cell-cell fusion assay to determine whether HIV-1 fusion is influenced by LY6E. despite the relatively low knockdown efficiency of LY6E in HeLa-TZM cells, we observed a 2- to 3-fold reduction in Env-mediated cell-cell fusion. CPZ largely rescued HIV-1 Env-mediated cell-cell fusion in LY6E knockdown cells. we used an Env-defective NL4.3-based HIV-1 vector (NL4.3-KFS) (28), which allows measurement of single-round infection and gene expression when pseudotyped with VSV-G. knockdown of LY6E resulted in a 2- to 3-fold reduction in luciferase activity. similar results were obtained by using another luciferase-based HIV-1 vector, HIV-LTR-Luc. LY6E promotes the replication of HIV-1 AD8 in THP-1 cells. the results presented so far were mostly from human primary PBMCs or CD4-positive T cell lines with CXCR4-using NL4.3 HIV-1. it would be interesting to determine whether the effects of LY6E can also be observed in monocytes and/or macrophages. cells were infected with NL4.3 bearing VSV-G (A and B) or with NL4.3 (AD8) (C and D) cell expressing shRNA IFITMs served as a positive control. RT activity and viral infectivity of AD8 virus decreased. -1 NL4.3-bearing VSV-G was used to infect activated human PBMCs for different periods of time. we quantified the mRNA levels of LY6E and representative ISGs by qRT-PCR. we observed that HIV-1 infection up-regulated expression of IFN-, LY6E, and ISG15 after 24 h of infection. the mRNA copy number of each gene at time point 0 was set to 1. results are the means S.D. of three independent experiments. Knockdown of endogenous LY6E Impairs HIV-1 Infection. knockdown of LY6E decreased HIV-1 production by 20\u201350% compared with cells expressing control shRNA. same virus stocks with equivalent amounts were also used to infect HeLa-TZM cells. ly6E does not appear to change the HIV-1 infectivity, at least in human PBMCs. ly6E expression in both cell lines was reduced, i.e. 20% and 60% for C1 and C2 respectively. we infected these cells with NL4.3 bearing VSV-G and observed 70\u201380% decrease in HIV-1 production by LY6E knockdown. knockdown of LY6E in supT1 cells decreases HIV-1 entry. ly6E knockdown is implying endogenous LY6E promotes HIV-1 spread. the effect of PI-PLC on the expression of LY6E on the cell surface was determined by flow cytometry. ly6E is a GPI-anchored protein and is expressed on the plasma membrane. phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC) is known to cleave GPI-anchored proteins on the plasma membrane. the inhibitory effect of LY6E knockdown on HIV-1 entry disappeared. we infected the SupT1 cells with WT NL4.3 and measured the Env binding to soluble CD4 (CD4-Ig) LY6E does not affect the Env-CD4 interaction on the cell surface. the result showed that LY6E does not affect the Env-CD4 interaction. HIV-1 Tat and the indicated Env plasmids were co-transfected into 293T cells. cocultured cells were lysed, and their firefly luciferase activities were measured. effect of CPZ treatment on cell-cell fusion effected by LY6E knockdown. NL4.3, or AD8 strains into HEK293T effector cells. cocultured these cells with target HeLa-TZM cells stably expressing shRNA LY6E or control shRNA for 16 h. cell-cell fusion was quantified by measuring the firefly luciferase activity. we observed a 2- to 3-fold reduction in Env-mediated cell-cell fusion. v-defective NL4.3-based HIV-1 vector (NL4.3-KFS) (28) allows measurement of single-round infection and gene expression when pseudotyped with VSV-G. knockdown of LY6E in SupT1 cells resulted in decreased RT activity. similar results were obtained by using another luciferase-based virus, HIV-LTR-Luc. HIV-1 NL4.3-KFS (Env-deficient) pseudotypes bearing VSV-G were used to infect SupT1 cells expressing shRNA control or shRNA LY6E. viral release was determined by measuring the RT activities. shRNA-LY6E-C2 showed higher efficiency compared with shRNA-LY6E-C1. we first tested infection of HIV-1 NL4.3 bearing VSV-G in these shRNA LY6E cells. triple knockdown of IFITM1, 2, and 3 (shRNA IFITMs) increased the RT activity and infectivity. LY6E is a positive modulator of HIV-1 infection in primary human PBMCs, immortalized CD4+ T lymphoid cells, and macrophages. LY6E promotes HIV-1 entry into host cells and up-regulates viral gene expression. ly6E is a GPI-anchored protein that is predominantly expressed on the plasma membrane. ly6E does not modulate the expression levels of CD4 and CXCR4 on the cell surface, nor does it alter their interactions with HIV-1 Env. more experiments are needed to determine how exactly LY6E promotes HIV-1 fusion and entry. LY6E protein has been shown to promote infection by HIV-1, measles virus, hepatitis D virus, and equine infectious anemia virus (1, 43\u201345) ly6E can also increase HIV-1 gene expression through association with the LTR and Rev response element regions of the lentiviruses. ly6E could negatively regulate host innate immunity and prevent type I IFN-induced inflammation. the results from this study should facilitate new avenues of investigation that will lead to a better understanding of the role of LY6E in AIDS pathogenesis and other viral infections. the results from this study should facilitate new avenues of investigation that will lead to a better understanding of the role of LY6E in AIDS pathogenesis and other viral infections.
