{"summary": "the study Fecal specimens (n = 40, from 40 patients 1\u201327 days after symptom onset) and urine specimens (n = 133, from 101 patients 2\u201357 days after symptom onset) were collected from hospitalized patients without SARS. the presence of serum immunoglobulin (Ig) G against SARS-CoV was confirmed by an immunofluorescence assay (4). mar test studied the correlation between optical density values at 450 nm (OD450) of the 2 ELISAs and log10 viral concentrations, as determined by real-time qRT-PCR. the cutoffs of the polyclonal antibody\u2013based ELISA have been determined previously, with specificities of 96% and 99% for fecal and urine specimens. qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. qRT-PCR, quantitative reverse transcription\u2013polymerase chain reaction; qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR can detect SARS-CoV in fecal specimens obtained on days 1 to 27 after onset of symptoms and in urine specimens obtained on days 9 to 45. qRT-PCR can detect SARS-CoV earlier in fecal specimens. the detection of SARS-CoV beyond this time may be due to prolonged shedding of nonviable viruses in these patients. higher detection rates by both ELISAs were found in specimens with higher viral concentrations. the correlation between viral load and ELISA OD450 values in fecal specimens tested with the polyclonal antibody\u2013based ELISA was not significant. however, there was a trend for such a correlation (Pearson correlation 0.229, p = 0.078) fecal and urine samples were used because they are easier and safer to obtain and more readily available."}
