{"summary": "TB is an airborne bacterial infection caused by the organism Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) it has surpassed HIV/AIDS as the leading cause of death due to a single infectious organism worldwide. TB attacks the lungs but can also infect other areas of the body. an estimated 10.4 million people developed active TB disease in 2015. the time between a and c is the serial interval; the time between b and c is the incubation period. TB disease can be caused by de novo infection, reactivation of the same bacterial strain as a previous infection [5, 21] or by infection with a bacterial strain different from. there has been no systematic review of methods to estimate the serial interval and reproductive number for TB. this complicates estimation of the serial interval, unless molecular techniques are used to distinguish reinfection and reactivation [21]. titles and abstracts of publications referenced in the articles we found were reviewed for inclusion for either parameter. TB and reproductive number (\u2018tuberculosis\u2019[MeSH] OR \u2018Mycobacterium tuberculosis\u2019[MeSH] OR \u2018tuberculosis\u2019[TI]) and (\u2018serial interval\u2019[tiab] or \u2018serial distribution\u2019 [tiab] or \u2018secondary cases\u2019 [tiab] or \u2018 titles and abstracts of the publications referenced in the articles we found were reviewed for inclusion for either parameter. for the SI, as limited number of publications met our inclusion criteria, we also reviewed the titles and abstracts of publications that cited the serial interval articles we included in a full-text review. the most frequent time to develop disease was estimated at between 20 and 30 years due to reinfection for those infected in the first year of life. between 10 and 14 years due to reinfection for those infected at age 10 and those infected at age 40. the probability of observing both the infector and the infected person depended on the time interval between isolates. one source of infection for each infected cluster 0.57 years (95% CI 0.44\u20130.73) Borgdorff [25] Same as [24] NA Median: 1.44 years (95% CI 1.29\u20131.63) Brooks-Pollock [26] Estimate the relative contributions of household and community transmission, the serial interval and the immunity afforded by a previous TB infection Descriptive approach on RFLP data. 24 articles used either a mathematical model fit with empirical data or a descriptive/regression approach on empirical data. the estimates range from as low as 0.26 for the Netherlands in 1993\u20132007 to as high as 4.3 in China in 2012. aandahl et al. [32] in 2014 reconciled the two methods by specifying an informative prior for two parameters in [30] and improving the convergence performance of the MCMC sampler in [31]. the reconciled estimates were 2.1 (95% CI 1.54\u20132.66) for the approximate method in [30] and 2.05 (95% CI 1.55\u20132.63) for the exact method in [31]. twenty-four articles analysed the reproductive number with empirical data. seventeen articles reported explicit estimates, with five estimating the effective reproductive number and 12 estimating the basic reproductive number. the majority of these articles used mathematical compartmental models with different variations in structure and parameterisation. 1993\u20132011 Surveillance and RFLP data Determine if mycobacterial lineages affect infection risk, clustering and disease progression among mycobacterium tuberculosis cases Descriptive and regression approach. genetic matching accurately reflects transmission patterns Effective Range: 0.17\u20131.04 Narula [37] India, 2006\u20132011 Quarterly reported data from Central TB Division Estimate basic R0 for TB Compartmental model with Bayesian melding technique.

TB incidence in San Francisco peaked between 1991 and 1993 due to the TB/HIV co-epidemic, which is consistent with the higher estimated reproductive number in [30\u201332]. in [38], compartments \u2018exposed\u2019, \u2018infectious and hospitalised\u2019 and \u2018infected\u2019 were included; in [42], compartments \u2018latent\u2019, \u2018infected\u2019 were used for two sub-populations: drug-sensitive and multidrug-resistant. the model parameters were also different specified: in [38], some parameters were assumed while others were estimated using a root-mean-squared error method while others were assumed. the majority of the existing publications use mathematical compartmental models, which are not often ideal for statistical inference and estimation due to strong assumptions for the model structure and parameters used to run the models. complexity of the natural history of TB and important factors such as HIV and drug resistance complicate these models and require additional parameters for which the data are sometimes not available. a limited number of studies have yielded explicit estimates for the serial interval and reproductive number of TB. a limited number of studies have yielded explicit estimates for the serial interval and reproductive number of TB. serial interval of TB can be used to determine how long one must monitor contacts of an infectious TB case to see if they will develop symptoms. the effective reproductive number can be used to monitor the efficacy of interventions in reducing transmission. as interventions decrease transmission, estimates of the reproductive number should correspondingly decrease. infected people can develop long after the end of studies, and interval censoring can fall during long intervals between two observed time points. patients may not seek medical assistance immediately after symptoms develop and diagnosis may require lab-processing time which causes delay in establishing the diagnosis [24] ambiguity exists due to the inconsistent availability of genetic typing of strains to link cases. further uncertainty exists due to the further uncertainty about how to best link strains when genetic information is available. in developed countries, the reproductive number was sometimes estimated to be well below 1. in developing countries, the reproductive number was as high as 4.3 in china in 2012 [38] and 3.55 in southern India from 2004 to 2006. in the Netherlands, the reproductive number has been consistently estimated at well below one, ranging from 0.24 [49] to 0.48 [39] the ratio of secondary cases and source cases was used to estimate the reproductive number. divergent results indicate the need for the use of whole genome sequencing (WGS), which can be used to effectively link source and secondary cases. model structure varies substantially from study to study, with no generally agreed upon approach to model TB and estimate parameters. some models often require assumptions about parameters used to run the models, which are likely to differ by country and time period. estimates for TB are very divergent \u2013 in reality, we would expect different results in different parts of the world, reflecting diversity in TB epidemics geographically. a limited number of studies have yielded explicit estimates for the serial interval and reproductive number of TB. TB burdens such as the former Soviet Union are not included in these papers. there was only one estimate from a high TB and high HIV burden country. the lack of estimates could be because incidence and mortality rates are currently used to monitor TB control."}
