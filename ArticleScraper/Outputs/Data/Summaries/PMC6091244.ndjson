{"summary": "Resveratrol (3,5,4\u2032-trihydroxy-trans-stilbene) is a stilbenoid compound found in numerous plants. it has also shown the potential for antiviral (Abba et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2017a,b) xins have regained a major role as last-resort agents for these infections. also polymyxin resistance has emerged and is now increasingly reported. in vitro activity of resveratrol, alone and in combination with colistin, against a collection of colistin-resistant pathogens of different species. ia was arbitrarily based on the high-level colistin MIC (i.e., 32 mg/L) as compared with the colistin MIC distribution for the species. for some strains, the mechanism of colistin resistance had been previously characterized. study n.d.d 32 4 2* 1* 0.5* 0.125* 0.125* E. cloacae CIP6085 \u2013 COL-R n.d. 128 128 32* 8* 0.5* 0.25* 0.125* K. pneumoniae KKBO-1a Blood MDR/COL-S ST258 Cannatelli et al., 2013 IS5-like at nt.75 of mgrB 64 64 64 16* 8* 4 these strains were the COL-S precursors of COL-R K. pneumoniae KKBO-4, K. pneumoniae KPB-2, and K. pneumoniae KK207-2 strains, respectively.
