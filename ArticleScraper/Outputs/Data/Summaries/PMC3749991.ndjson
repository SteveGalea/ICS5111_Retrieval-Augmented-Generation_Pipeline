{"summary": "cholera epidemics have not been seen in high income countries since the early 20th century. cholera epidemics have not been seen in high income countries since the early 20th century. cholera epidemics have not been seen in high income countries since the early 20th century. medical professionals tended to deride those who suggested cholera might be contagious as superstitious and unsophisticated. despite nearly two centuries of study by epidemiologists, the fundamental dynamic properties of cholera remain poorly characterized. the book also includes quantitative appendices containing data that can be used to reconstruct epidemic curves. we used Brigham\u2019s data to parameterize simple mathematical models of cholera transmission.
