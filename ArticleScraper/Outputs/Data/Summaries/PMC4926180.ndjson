{"summary": "the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the largest cellular organelle. it is the most commonly hijacked \u201cniche\u201d during viral infection. the ER was one of the last large cell organelles to be discovered. a coiled-coil protein forming oligomers bridging across the luminal space of the sheets that are studded with ribosomes. reticulon/DP1/Yop1p proteins stabilize the sheets, forming wedges inside the bilayer and arc-like scaffolds around the edge. the models in (B) and (C) are adapted from [8,9]. ER sheets are a series of flat cisternae which, save for the edges, have low membrane curvature [8,17,18] and can be studded with ribosomes [19,20] the structure of sheets is governed by integral membrane proteins such as CLIMP63 (cytoskeleton-linking membrane protein of 63 kDa; formally p63) ER membrane-bound microtubules may stabilize the rough ER by physically limiting the lateral mobility of polysomes. ribosome and microtubule binding also bind ribosomes to create a platform for high-rate protein synthesis. ER sheets are connected by a motif that is characterized by a flat membrane surface. ules tubules radiate from the NE and from ER sheets and interconnect. tubules differ from sheets mainly by their higher membrane curvature. tubules have a lower ribosome density than sheets and are built mainly of smooth ER membranes. different RTN isoforms might be specialized for distinct trafficking functions. DP1 (defective in polyposis 1), TB2 or REEP5 (receptor expression enhancing protein 5) and the yeast ortholog Yop1p (yeast homolog of the polyposis locus protein 1) also involved in maintaining ER tubule structure. two ER-enriched Rab GTPases (Rab10 and Rab18) were found recently to be involved in regulating ER dynamics (reviewed in [6]) and ER-ER tubule fusion ([52,53], respectively. their role in determining the ER shape has been suggested to occur via their interaction with molecular motors during ER sliding that would facilitate rapid ER-ER fusion. ER tubules may also be involved in lipid synthesis. tubulation of the ER network might provide a simple, yet effective, mechanism for partitioning of the ER during mitosis. ER is a highly dynamic cytoplasmic membrane system composed of two structurally distinct subdomains: the nuclear envelope (NE), enclosing the nucleus, and a polygonal network called the peripheral ER. the ER is a highly dynamic cytoplasmic membrane system composed of two structurally distinct subdomains: the nuclear envelope (NE), enclosing the nucleus. the ER network comprises the nuclear envelope (NE) and the peripheral ER. the peripheral ER is composed of stacked sheets, studded with ribosomes, and tubules extending the reticular network to the plasma membrane. a double membrane separates the intranuclear space from the cytoplasmic compartment. interactions of the INM proteins with chromatin and the lamin and of the ONM with nuclear pores and the cytoskeleton are required for the maintenance of the NE structure. this double membrane separates the intranuclear space from the cytoplasmic compartment. ribosomes and large polyribosomes preferentially localize to ER sheets. the high density of ribosomes (1000 ribosomes/m2) on ER sheets may regulate their shape. ER membrane-bound microtubules may stabilize the rough ER by physically limiting the lateral mobility of polysomes. ER tubules tubules are highly dynamic structures, constantly forming and rearranging and interconnecting at three-way junctions. they radiate from the NE and from ER sheets and interconnect all together, reaching various parts of the cells. tubules differ from sheets mainly by their higher membrane curvature, with a higher surface-to-volume ratio in comparison to sheets. yeast cells have two RTN genes (RTN1 and RTN2), each encoding for a single protein. mammals have four (RTN1, RTN2, RTN3, RTN4/Nogo) encoding eleven isoforms. DP1 (defective in polyposis 1), also known as TB2 or REEP5 (receptor expression enhancing protein 5), is also involved in maintaining ER tubule structure. atlastins regulate ER shape in a GTP-dependent manner. fusion occurs upon dimerization of two atlastins residing in neighboring membranes. two ER-enriched Rab GTPases (Rab10 and Rab18) were found to be involved in regulating ER dynamics. Molecules up to 9 nm in diameter can passively diffuse through their inner channel [15], while molecules up to 39 nm in diameter in most cases require active nuclear import/export. ER sheets are a series of flat cisternae which, save for the edges, have low membrane curvature [8,17,18] and can be studded with ribosomes [19,20]. two microtubule-binding proteins are enriched in ER sheets, CLIMP63 [26] and p180, which also bind ribosomes to create a platform for high-rate protein synthesis. their edges owe their curvature to the presence of wedge-shaped proteins, called reticulons (RTNs) that are also involved in shaping ER tubules [8] tubules radiate from the NE and from ER sheets and interconnect all together. tubules differ from sheets mainly by their higher membrane curvature. tubules have a lower ribosome density than sheets and are built mainly of smooth ER membranes. ER tubules can be generated and maintained when only 10% of the surface of the ER tubules is occupied by hairpin-forming membrane proteins [34]. the current fusion model assumes that atlastins regulate ER shape in a GTP-dependent manner. two ER-enriched Rab GTPases (Rab10 and Rab18) were found to be involved in regulating ER dynamics (reviewed in [6]) and ER-ER tubule fusion ([52,53], respectively. their role in determining the ER shape has been suggested to occur via their interaction with molecular motors (e.g., kinesin-1 and dynein) during ER sliding. ER tubules may also be involved in lipid synthesis. tubulation of the ER network might provide a simple, yet effective mechanism for partitioning of the ER during mitosis. tubulation may be linked to translation activity on ER membranes. overexpression of RTN4a eliminated sheet structures from the interphase ER. the ER can adopt a wide range of organizations to adapt to different functions. in general, cells involved in synthesis and secretion of large amounts of protein possess many ribosome\u2013studded sheets [7,19], whereas poorly secreting cells contain an abundant tubular network [7,70]. in this section we will describe the different strategies used by viruses to modify ER membranes. a comprehensive summary of virus groups remodeling this compartment is given in Table 1. a comprehensive summary of virus groups remodeling this compartment is given in Table 1.

[95] ET IEM Langat Virus (LGTV) [96] TEM, ET IF Single-me transient interactions of DNA and RNA Viruses with the Nuclear Envelope (NE) have to pass the NE to deliver the viral genome to the site of viral genome amplification [112] in many cases, this delivery follows the classical nuclear entry pathway via the NPC. in some cases, this delivery follows the classical nuclear entry pathway via the NPC. envelopment/de-envelopment strategy is developed to cross the NE. it starts with budding of the nucleocapsid at the INM to form an enveloped particle within the PNS. a similar strategy is used by baculoviruses [126,127,128] the single internal membrane bilayer of these viruses is generated through an unusual mechanism, comprising the generation of membrane sheets by rupture of ER cisternae. there the single bilayers interact with capsid proteins to generate crescents and eventually pre-capsids. these factories have an ordered organization, with a preference to accumulate the viral genomes in the factory center to facilitate continuous generation of virus progeny. in reovirus-infected cells, filled and empty virions (Reoviridae) are embedded in a membranous inclusion of cellular origin. both ER elements and virus particles are in contact with the cytosolic face of the plasma membrane. Zippered ER membranes are found in CK cells infected with the gammacoronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), 16 hpi. membranes fold to form individual spherules with a channel connecting the cytosol (yellow arrows) membranes fold to form individual spherules with a channel connecting the cytosol. ER membranes labeled with protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and viral proteins were found close to crescents arguing that they originate from the ER. the current model proposes that fragmentation of the ER membrane precedes crescent formation. as a result, crescents consisting of a single-membrane bilayer, derived from fragmented ER, and an external protein scaffold are formed towards the ER lumen. the viral factories of PBCV-1 (family Phycodnaviridae) [79] are very different. the central region consists of a network of single-membrane bilayers acting as scaffold for capsid formation. the viral genomes localize to the periphery of the factories and are excluded from the membrane-containing cores. ER invaginations A strategy frequently used by positive-strand RNA viruses to remodel ER membranes is the induction of membrane invaginations towards the ER lumen. one well-studied example is brome mosaic virus replicating its RNA on ER-derived spherules (60 nm diameter) in close proximity to the nucleus. another bromovirus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, also induces the formation of spher multiple ER-originated vesicle packets (VPs) were connected to each other via tubules. positive-strand RNA viruses infecting animals and humans also induce ER invaginations as part of their RF. VPs have a diameter between 80\u2013150 nm. elongated vesicles or tubules (up to 800 nm in length) were found that were much more abundant in persistently than in acutely infected cells. the function of these tubules is not known, but the absence of pores suggests that the tubules might represent aberrant RFs resulting from incorrect membrane remodeling or an antiviral cellular defense mechanism restricting infection. vacuoles enclosing vesicles of various sizes have been found in bovine viral diarrhea virus-infected cells [158]. pestiviruses appear to use a different strategy to form their RF. single-membrane tubular clusters are transformed into smaller irregularly shaped single-membrane structures. late in infection, they are replaced by vesicles with a much more complex structure. the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis coincides with the predominance of single-membrane tubules, suggesting that these structures are involved in viral RNA replication. enterovirus infection causes a strong inhibition of the anterograde ER-Golgi transport [175,176] and treatment with Brefeldin A, a well-known inhibitor of the secretory pathway, abrogates enterovirus replication [177,178] the findings, together with the reported role of COPII [174,179] and COPI vesicles [180] and the ERES [184] argue that membranes from multiple cellular sources, mostly from ER and Gol s are formed remains enigmatic. they might originate from a single-membrane vesicle or tubule budding from its donor organelle. a \u201cpre\u2013DMV\u201d structure has not yet been proven to exist in the case of HCV. the most striking structures induced by IBV are zippered ER membranes [107] that distinguish this virus from the members of the genus Betacoronavirus, e.g., MHV, SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV. the zippered ER was associated with 60\u201380 nm diameter spherules (Figure 2D and Figure 3E) CMs appear to have a distinct lipid composition, most notably high amounts of cholesterol. cisternae were found in contact with reovirus inclusions [80] reminiscent to rubella virus RFs. reoviruses are non-enveloped, the ER might be used as a membranous scaffold to facilitate virus particle trafficking to the cell periphery, thus bypassing the Golgi apparatus. in many cases, this delivery follows the classical nuclear entry pathway via the NPC. in some cases, this delivery follows the classical nuclear entry pathway via the NPC. nucleocapsids of herpesviruses are too large (120 nm) to pass through the NE. envelopment/de-envelopment strategy is used by baculoviruses. other viruses such as polyoma- and papillomaviruses leave the nucleus by disrupting the NE. ments giving rise to nucleus-like structures designated viral factories (VFs) these elaborate structures enable a spatio-temporal coordination of viral replication and assembly of new virions. some DNA viruses replicate their genomes in the cytoplasm in close association with ER-derived membranes. IBV induces zippered ER membranes comprising tethered spherules. IBV also induces DMVs, albeit to low numbers. ER-derived convoluted membranes are also found in cells infected with members of the Coronaviridae and Flaviviridae. invaginations of ER membranes are known as vesicle packets (VPs) these vesicles remain connected to the cytosol through 10 nm diameter pores (yellow arrow) some of them remain connected to their source organelle, the ER (yellow arrow); others remain connected to their source organelle, the ER (yellow arrow); others remain connected to their source organelle, the ER (yellow arrow); mimivirus Acanthamoeba polyphaga (family Mimiviridae) acquires its inner membrane from open membrane intermediates that correspond to crescents. fusion of multiple ER\u2013derived vesicles (70 nm diameter) is initiated by fusion of multiple ER\u2013derived vesicles (70 nm diameter) the resulting membrane structures subsequently rupture to form large, open, single-layered membrane sheets from which viral membranes are generated. the visualization of cell membranes studded with ribosomes at the periphery of the VF. the fact that mimivirus infection is accompanied by massive redistribution of ER markers suggest that mimivirus membranes are derived from the ER. isternae serve as precursors for viral membranes and are recruited to the VFs. they are ruptured into a dense network of open, single-bilayer membrane sheets. these open sheets interact with the capsid protein to form pre-capsids. these data reveal a common principle of all members of the NCLDV clade. vesicles with a diameter between 80\u2013150 nm have been found in the lumen of ER sheets of mammalian cells infected with dengue virus. this is the case of red clover necrosis mosaic virus (RCNMV, Tombusviridae) that also induces invaginations at the NE [84] beet black scorch virus (BBSV; Tombusviridae) inducing distinct cytopathological changes typical of dsRNA, a presumed replication intermediate, and viral replicase proteins in these vesicles may be the site of RNA replication. the presence of 10 nm wide pores (e.g., [88,92,95] linking the vesicle interior to the cytosol ensures efficient exchange of cellular and viral components. structures morphologically reminiscent to those induced by flaviviruses were also found in cells infected with pestiviruses. pestiviruses appear to use different strategies to form their RFs. two recent publications suggest that these distinct membranous structures are induced in a time-dependent manner in poliovirus and coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3)-infected cells. early in infection, single-membrane tubular clusters that are transformed into bigger irregularly shaped single-membrane structures predominate. membranes from multiple cellular sources, mostly from ER and Golgi, are used by picornaviruses to build up their RFs [98] the source of membrane rearrangements may be a general property of the Picornaviridae family members. similar DMVs have also been found in cells infected with hepatitis C virus. flaviviruses (e.g., DENV and TBEV) induce RFs with a very different morphology. a \u201cpre\u2013DMV\u201d structure has not yet been proven to exist in HCV-infected cells. s found in arterivirus- and coronavirus-infected cells are not connected to the cytosol. in the case of HCV, only 10% of DMVs have an opening towards the cytosol. this is the case for infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), an important poultry pathogen belonging to the genus Gammacoronavirus. CMs are physically linked with ER-containing invaginations and contain NS3. CMs appear to have a distinct lipid composition, mostnotably high amounts of cholesterol. CMs are absent in cells of insects that are cholesterol auxotrophs. brome mosaic virus (BMV, family Bromoviridae) replicating its RNA on ER-derived spherules (60 nm diameter) in close proximity to the nucleus. another bromovirus, cowpea chlorotic mottle virus, also induces the formation of spherules in the lumen of the perinuclear and peripheral ER. VPs may be the site of RNA replication (e.g., [87,92,95,96,147,151]. presence of 10 nm wide pores (e.g., [88,92,95] linking the vesicle interior to the cytosol ensures efficient exchange of cellular and viral components. in TBEV\u2013infected tick cells, elongated vesicles or tubules (up to 800 nm in all members of the genus Flavivirus use the ER as membrane source for the formation of their RFs. assembly of progeny virions seems to occur via budding into the ER lumen in close proximity to the VPs. structures morphologically reminiscent to those induced by flaviviruses were also found in cells infected with pestiviruses. two recent publications suggest that these distinct membranous structures are induced in a time-dependent manner in poliovirus and coxsackievirus-infected cells. early in infection, single-membrane tubular clusters that are transformed into bigger irregularly shaped single-membrane structures predominate. the exponential phase of viral RNA synthesis coincides with the predominance of single-membrane tubules. membranes from multiple cellular sources, mainly from ER and Golgi, are used by picornaviruses to build up their RFs [98] the source of membranes used by these viruses to build up their RFs is a matter of debate. the findings, together with the reported role of COPII and COPI vesicles, are a matter of debate. DMVs were found in cells infected with equine arterivirus (EAV) [100,101], mouse hepatitis virus [185,186], severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-coronavirus [102,103] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [187]. similar DMVs have also been found in cells infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV, family Flaviviridae) [104, the exact localization of the replicase remains unclear. it might be localized on the surface or in its interior. in the latter case, newly synthesized viral RNA has to be released from these double\u2013sheltered organelles. positive-strand RNA viruses form a continuous network with the VPs induced by DENV [92] or with the DMVs induced by SARS-CoV [103] CMs are frequently connected with the ER [92], most likely smooth ER. CMs may correspond to storage sites for proteins and lipids required for replication and assembly. a recent study identified membranes within the inclusions that appear to be derived from ER, Golgi or from an as yet undefined cellular source. rough ER cisternae were found in contact with reovirus inclusions [80] reminiscent to the architecture of rubella virus RFs. positive-curving RTNs appear to play a role in the formation of negative curvature invaginations induced by BMV on ER membranes. depletion of RTNs results in the formation of smaller vesicles. in the case of enteroviruses these interactions enhance viral replication. Rab18 is involved in the interaction of fatty acid synthase (FASN) with NS3. this recruitment is thought to promote fatty acid biosynthesis. a critical role of ER-resident proteins has also been reported. dylinositol 4-phosphate (PI4P)-cholesterol flux is mediated by several proteins. the ER-associated PI4P phosphatase Sac1, hydrolyzing PI4P, and the PITPb transfer protein beta (PITPb), shuttling PI. the findings suggest that HCV exploits VAPs and OSBP to remodel ER membranes. many aspects of how viruses usurp ER function to promote these different steps are poorly understood. double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) are the most predominant membranous structures detectable in hepatitis C virus-infected cells. questions require a comprehensive strategy that combines biochemical and cell biological approaches with cutting-edge imaging methods. combining these methods with the use of ER-dependent viruses as sensitive and targeted probes will provide new and important insights into ER biology."}
