{"summary": "a cross-sectional study was conducted in Thailand to assess rabies-related knowledge and practices among persons regularly exposed to bats and bat habitats. participants were asked to describe actions they would take in response to a bat bite as well as actions for a bite from a potentially rabid animal. rabies is an exceptionally fatal encephalitis caused by rhabdoviruses in the Lyssavirus genus. transmission typically occurs when broken skin is contaminated with saliva from an infected mammal. the most well-known and ubiquitous lyssavirus is the rabies virus (RABV), which circulates in New World bats and both Old and New World terrestrial mammals. no human cases of rabies linked to lyssaviruses other than canine-associated RABV have been reported in Thailand or the rest of SE Asia. interest in bats and their role in lyssavirus transmission has increased in the region. in the last 10 years, evidence of lyssavirus maintenance has emerged from surveillance in Cambodia, Thailand, Bangladesh, and the Philippines. rabid vampire bats are a major cause of human mortality in south America's Amazon region [21] rabies awareness in SE Asia is lacking in Asia. rabies postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) for bat bites and scratches is highly effective in preventing cases of bat-borne rabies. individuals are most at-risk of bat exposures in Thailand. we surveyed persons who regularly come in contact with bats or bat dwellings through occupational activities and other practices. we sought to elucidate gaps in knowledge that potentially have bearing on rabies prevention. questionnaire was developed in English and translated and reviewed by native Thai speakers employed by the office of the U.S. CDC, International Emerging Infections Program in Bangkok. questionnaire was developed based on socio-ecological reasoning about gaps in rabies knowledge that potentially lead to failed prevention on the individual level. participants were asked to describe the severity of rabies. only responses that emphasized death or profound suffering were considered evidence that the participant recognized rabies as being severe. awareness of other diseases that humans can get from bats was also elicited. engagement in at least one of these activities within the last 5 years was inclusion criteria for participation. participants were classified based on proximity to bat caves and/or mass bat roosting sites. a similar method was employed to locate bat hunters/trappers in communities where fruit farms are known to attract flying fox bats. questionnaire was designed to be administered in Thai via face-to-face interviews. responses entered in PDAs using geoAge FAST software. data collected on demographics, primary bat-associated activity and years of experience. questions that were specifically asked about bats preceded all questions asked about rabies to minimize reporting bias. participants were asked open-ended questions to minimize the interviewer's influence on responses. a majority of participants reported having little or no knowledge of rabies. no statistically significant differences between activity groups with respect to rabies vaccination. only 68% of guano miners indicated animal bites as a mechanism of transmission compared to 90% of non-guano miners (p = 0.03) when asked to identify which animals are sources of rabies, only 11 (10%) participants named bats. dogs were named by 80 (76%), cats were named by 41 (39%) twenty-eight (26%) participants expressed that they would seek medical care or rabies PEP for a bat bite or scratch. a significantly higher proportion (95%) advocated these actions if the bite came from a potentially rabid animal (p = 0.0001) a history of transdermal bat exposure (bite or scratch) was reported by 29 (27%) participants. a history of transdermal bat exposure (bite or scratch) was reported by 29 (27%) participants. guano miners reported the highest frequency of transdermal bat exposures, were the least knowledgeable about rabies, and were the least likely to say they would respond to bat exposures in a manner that would ensure rabies prevention. guano miners reported the highest frequency of transdermal bat exposures, were the least knowledgeable about rabies. the effectiveness of any bat-borne rabies prevention strategy may hinge on how well it diffuses into communities where guano mining regularly occurs. research shows a need to raise public awareness of the potential risk of rabies associated with bat exposures. there have been no reported cases of human rabies cases associated with bats in Thailand. nearly a third of all participants reported a history of rabies vaccination. this may help account for why bats have yet to be linked to any human rabies cases in the country. however, immunity levels could change if PEP use becomes more conservative in the future. sample size of 200 persons was arbitrarily determined given the lack of reliable estimates for the study population size. failure to meet this number was largely due to the difficulty in finding willing participants who engaged in bat hunting and guano mining. however, we minimized the influence that geography might have imparted on the associations we observed. s, particularly in regions of the world where outbreaks of severe zoonoses have occurred. questions remain regarding reservoirs for such diseases."}
