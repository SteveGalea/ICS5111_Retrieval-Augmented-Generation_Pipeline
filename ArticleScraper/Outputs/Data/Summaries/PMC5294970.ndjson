{"summary": "astroviruses are small, nonenveloped, RNA viruses that are a major cause of gastroenteritis in infants, immunocompromised people, and the elderly. despite the disease burden, little is known about the immune response to astrovirus infection. recent work using small animal models and cell culture systems has revealed an important role in the innate immune response. the structural proteins encoded in the third ORF (ORF2) are expressed from the subgenomic RNA. new astrovirus particles have been observed on double membranes. the progeny virions exit the cell through a non-lytic mechanism promoted by caspase activation. the adaptive immune response contains two arms: the humoral, or antibody-mediated/B cell response, and the cell-mediated response. early studies in the turkey poult model found little adaptive immune responses after TAstV-2 infection. studies using the newly emerging mouse model and clinical studies in humans demonstrate that the adaptive immune response is key in controlling astrovirus infection and disease. a complete understanding in the adaptive immune response, and how it limits astrovirus replication, cannot be determined. studies have found astrovirus antibodies against astroviruses of other animal species in the absence of disease. astrovirus isolates have been identified as potential causes of encephalitis in immunocompromised human patients. astrovirus has been detected in nasopharyngeal secretions and serum and plasma of severe immunodeficiency (SCID) patients after HSCT [32], and detection of astrovirus in the blood has been associated with fever [33] few studies have demonstrated a role for T cell-mediated control of astrovirus infection. replication is not needed to induce iNOS in macrophages. iNOS induction occurs during astrovirus infection of epithelial cells. TAstV-2 infection stimulates nitrite production, which limits viral replication. treatment with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitors increased TAstV-2 replication in vitro and in vivo. infection induced a small, but significant increase in IFN- mRNA and protein levels at 24 hpi [62,63] transcription factor IFN regulatory factor (IRF)-3 was located in the cytoplasm in infected cells at 12 hpi but was localized in the nucleus at 24\u201348 hpi. HAstV-4 infection did not block polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (polyI:C)-induced type I IFN levels. astrovirus infection has been shown to increase epithelial permeability. HAstV-1 infection in the presence of an IFN- neutralizing antibody saw increased levels of flux compared to isotype control. signaling in astrovirus replication, clearance, and barrier permeability have been examined in vivo using IFNaR-/- knockout mice. the viral titers shed in the stool of wild-type mice peaked at 6 to 11 dpi. wild-type mice titers rapidly decreased after 11 dpi and cleared the infection by 53 dpi. astroviruses have been found in macrophages of lambs and described in calves. but whether these cells are activated in response to astrovirus infection have yet to be determined. a study in mice found a role for the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) transcription factor. stV2 had watery diarrhea by 24 h post infection (hpi), this diarrhea was not associated with inflammation and pathology. only mild destruction of the villi was observed with few observations of dying enterocytes [19,58] studies by Koci et al. demonstrate that TAstV-2 infection stimulates nitrite production, which limits viral replication. astrovirus infection induced a small, but significant increase in IFN- mRNA and protein levels at 24 hpi [62,63] both groups pretreated the human intestinal adenocarcinoma cell line Caco2 with recombinant type I IFN before astrovirus infection. marvin et al. pretreated Caco2 cells with increasing amounts of IFN-. they also saw a 2-fold increase in viral RNA and infectious virion levels. the amount of IFN- produced during astrovirus infection is sufficient to decrease infectious progeny virion levels. the effects of type I IFN signaling in astrovirus replication, clearance, and barrier permeability have been examined in vivo using IFNaR-/- knockout mice. the viral titers shed in the stool of wild-type mice peaked at 6 to 11 dpi. studies of Guix et al. and Marvin et al. demonstrate that the type I IFN system can limit astrovirus replication in vitro and in vivo and protects against astrovirus-induced barrier permeability. how astrovirus replication induces type I IFN production and why induction is only seen late in infection and at low levels remains unknown. type I IFN signaling leads to STAT1-mediated transcription of antiviral proteins that can inhibit astrovirus replication. astrovirus may evade the immune system by preventing complement activation. astrovirus inhibition of complement activation is a key player in evading the immune system. studies in turkey poults suggest that astrovirus infection suppresses the immune system, making the host more susceptible to subsequent infections. astrovirus infection in vitro reduced macrophage viability and intracellular killing of a subsequent Escherichia coli challenge compared to uninfected macrophages. the development of a mouse model will be invaluable in understanding the viral replication kinetics and innate and adaptive immune responses to astrovirus infection in mammals. a full understanding of the immune response to astrovirus infection is necessary if we are to control and prevent astrovirus diseases."}
