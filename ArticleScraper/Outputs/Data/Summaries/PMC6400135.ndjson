{"summary": "study aims to assess the prevalence and clinical prognosis of GBS among pediatrics admitted with acute paralysis. children (14 years old) admitted to the hospital complaining of acute paralysis and later diagnosed with one form or variant of GBS. male gender could be a determinant of rapid progression to maximum paralysis. older age group in pediatrics is expected to endure residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset. the most common types of preceding infections were upper respiratory tract infections of viral etiologies, followed by gastrointestinal infections. the most common types of preceding infections were upper respiratory tract infections of viral etiologies, followed by gastrointestinal infections. in one prospective study, 96% of children were either asymptomatic or had minor residual symptoms during the recovery phase. a systematic review of GBS in 2014 described the findings of three studies conducted in Saudi Arabia. a systematic review of GBS described the findings of three studies conducted in 2014. a retrospective cross-sectional study based on a thorough review of medical records between 2005 and 2015 at the largest tertiary healthcare facility in Riyadh. the estimated annual rate of pediatric visits to the emergency department is 205,800. clinical outcomes included duration of progression to maximum paralysis (cutoff set at 2 weeks), residual paralysis set at 60 days, and prevalence of recurrent vs relapsed GBS. a concurrent infection with GBS or vaccine occurred in 34 (69.4%) cases. minimal seasonal variation in GBS admissions was observed between the summer and winter seasons, 44.9% in colder seasons vs 55.1% in warmer seasons. patients and abnormal spine MRI (ie, intense enhancement of the terminal nerve roots, significant thickening of the anterior spinal nerve root in the conus medullaris and cauda equine) in 4 (26.7%) Cerebrospinal fluid analysis showed high protein levels in 15 (62.5%) patients in the sample, with a high white blood cell level in 4 (10.2%) cases. plasmapheresis 4 (8.2) Intravenous immunoglobulin 40 (81.6) Intravenous immunoglobulin and steroids 5 (10.2) Intensive care unit

2=1.7 a total of 100 pediatric cases were admitted to the emergency department complaining of acute paralysis. the 10-year prevalence of GBS among cases with acute paralysis was 49%. males constituted 29 (59.2%) of the sample, whereas 20 (40.8%) were females. no 15 (30.6) Season of incident Fall/winter 22 (44.9) Spring/summer 27 (55.1) Clinical management and outcomes Almost half of the sample (n=27, 55.1%) complained of back or limb pain. 7 (14.3%) complained of limb paresthesia/numbness. patients who exhibited a progression to maximum paralysis in 2 weeks numbered 34 (69.4%), while 15 (30.6%) had a progression to maximum paralysis in >2 weeks. three patients suffered from recurrent GBS and one case from a relapse. all cases complaining of respiratory problems exhibited a progression to maximum paralyses in 2 weeks, compared to those with no respiratory problems, P=0.027. residual paralysis at 60 days post disease onset was highly associated with GBS patients aged 8\u201314 years (n=15, 65.2%), compared to younger patients (n=8, 30.8%), P=0.016. 23 (67.6%) 11 (32.4%) 18 (52.9%) 16 (47.1%) No 11 (73.3%) 4 (26.7%) 5 (33.3%) 10 (66.7%) 2=0.158, P=0.691 2=1.607,

models showed that males were 5.69 times more likely to exhibit progression to maximum paralysis in 2 weeks compared to females, adjusted P=0.034. older patients with age 8\u201314 years were 3.9 times more likely to sustain residual paralysis at 60 days. prevalence of AIDP in two far Eastern settings was 20/30 (66.7%)26 and 324/661 (49%),27 much higher than that reported in this setting as 18/49 (17.9%) a 10-year study showed that 2.1/100,000 acute paralysis cases were GBS, of which the male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1.24. autonomic dysfunction and cranial nerve involvement were significantly associated with shorter time duration to maximum paralysis or nadir. plasmapheresis conducted at early stages of the disease (within 7 days) has been proven to be a leading factor in shortening the duration to maximum paralysis. 1%\u20136% of patients who have had GBS will experience a recurrent attack. this makes the prevalence of recurrent cases in this setting at the upper limits. reoccurrence or relapse of GBS is not uncommon. this study has not reported the population incidence of GBS during the 10-year period, but rather limited its interest to the prevalence of GBS among acute paralytic cases. last but not least, Zika virus has been reported to be a potential preceding trigger of GBS,14,15 yet no positive cases for Zika virus have so far been reported in Saudi Arabia. multicenter pooling of GBS-related data is crucial to boost the sample representativeness of the population. a national GBS database will also aid in better understanding the various GBS variants with their distinctive clinical characteristics."}
