{"summary": "the equation is given below, where I(t) is the cumulative number of infected cases at time t in days. tm = ti+ (lna)/r is equal to the inflection point ti when a = 1. we can show mathematically that ti is the only inflection point ti when a = 1. the multistage Richards model procedure requires 5 steps. first, fit the Richards model to cumulative cases on successive days by using a standard least-square routine. if estimated parameters remain convergent until no more new cases are detected, the outbreak has only 1 phase. the best fitting Richards model, ending on April 26 and 28, yields the parameter values given in bold letters. the estimated value for the turning point ti during this phase is computed from the estimates for r, a, and tm by using equation (2). model fitting gives an estimate of K = 140.53 (95% CI 115.88\u2013165.17) that is, given case data at the time of the outbreak, we could estimate the cumulative case number in the first phase accurately (Figure 3) 10 days after the turning point on March 25 and 22 days before the end of the first phase. this estimate also is the cumulative case number assuming no subsequent waves of infection. the index patient for the second phase had onset of respiratory symptoms, fever, and diarrhea on April 19 (11), 3 days before the turning point pinpointed by this procedure. our result also corroborates the assessment of Health Canada, which pinpointed April 21 as the start of second phase of the outbreak in Toronto. index patient of the second phase stayed, 78 had exposures that occurred before May 23 (11). This estimate is obtained by using data that end just 11 days after the turning point on May 24 giving an accurate prediction of the actual cumulative case number. we can pinpoint retrospectively the 3 key turning points for the spread of disease during the 2-phase outbreak in Toronto area. the first turning point for the spread of SARS occurred on March 20 when the first wave of infections leveled off. the third and final turning point for the infections occurred on May 19, when the spread of disease finally leveled off. the data from April 28 to June 4 give a good estimated 95% CI of the cumulative cases of 246.67\u2013251.25, 8 days before onset of the last case. from Table 1, r = 0.146 for the first phase. we also assume the duration of infectiousness T to be 8.4 days. the accuracy of predictions depends heavily on the assumption that no stochastic events occur in the remaining days that could significantly alter the course of the current phase of an outbreak. detecting a second turning point or start of a second phase is especially useful as it allows us to recognize early that an epidemic is worsening."}
