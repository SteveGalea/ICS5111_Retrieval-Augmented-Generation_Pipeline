{"summary": "a long-standing paradigm defined memory B cells as IgM-IgG+ isotype switched cells. in mice, populations of CD19+IgM+ able to mount secondary responses have been identified. the biological properties that ensure the long-term persistence of memory and efficient secondary antibody responses have not been completely established. IgG+ cells that could rapidly respond upon challenge did not persist long, while IgM+ cells could generate a second wave of germinal center responses allowing persistence of memory. new therapy strategies may require the adoptive transfer of high-affinity memory B cells, ready to respond and able to persist. purified nave B cells from the SWHEL.AID/YFP.Rag2-/- mice were transferred into adoptive hosts together with monoclonal OVA-specific CD4+ T cells from transgenic mice. Upon immunization with OVA-HEL complexes, we obtained a significant number of persistent HEL-specific IgM+IgG-YFP+ and IgG+YFP+ memory B cells. mice were purified from spleens and lymph nodes by flow cytometry sorting. single-cell suspensions containing 5104 B cells and 106 T cells were transferred intravenously into B6.Rag2-/- recipient hosts. purity of sorted cells was above 98%. monoclonal antibodies conjugated to pacific blue, Qdot-655, Brillant Violet 605, allophycocyanin, peridinin chlorophyll protein\u2013cyanine 5.5, phycoerythrin-cyanine7. cells were also stained with HEL (Sigma) coupled with AF594 using Alexa Fluor\u00ae 594 Protein Labeling Kit from Life technologies. the purity of the sorted populations varied from 90\u201395%. ELISA and ELISpot assay Sera HEL-specific Ig concentrations were quantified by ELISA. plates were coated with HEL and saturated with PBS-5% Milk. confocal microscopy Spleens from 14 day-immunized mice were initially fixed with paraformaldehyde and embedded in 4% low-gelling-temperature agarose. samples were saturated with PBS supplemented with 10% of fetal calf serum, then were labeled with primary antibodies anti-B220-APC (clone RA3-6B2) and anti-IgD-PE (clone 11-26c.2a) euthanasia of the mice was performed by cervical dislocation. the general status of the mice was controlled daily by monitoring the appearence of obvious pain, distress or suffering (prostration, respiratory issues, loss of weight) in this case, experiment was stopped and the animals were euthanized. suspensions containing 5104 B cells and 106 T cells were transferred intravenously into B6.Rag2-/- recipient hosts. the purity of sorted cells was above 98%. 24 h after transfer, mice were immunized with 1 mg of OVA-HEL. mice were injected with 50 mg/kg of BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) for proliferation assay. mice were injected with 50 mg/kg of BrdU (Sigma-Aldrich) and were killed 24 or 72 hours later. plates were incubated for 12 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2 atmosphere. revealing substrate was added (2,3 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate diluted in 2-amino-2-methyl-1-proprenolol buffer) we have devised an experimental system that permits the comparison between nave and memory B cells expressing the same antigen receptor. for that purpose we used SWHEL transgenic mice in a Rag2-deficient background holding a single population of monoclonal B cells. a fraction of the HEL-specific B cells underwent class switch recombination. at day 14 we recovered both IgM+IgG-AID/YFP+ and IgG+AID/YFP+ cells. two weeks after antigenic challenge we observed the formation of germinal centers in the spleen of the host mice. splenic B cells from SWHEL.AID/YFP.Rag2-/- naive donor (upper panels), immunized mice reconstituted only with B cells (middle panels) and immunized mice reconstituted with both B and T cells 14 days after immunization (lower panels), for expression of YFP (middle panels), and IgM and IgG (right panels) from two weeks onwards the total number of B cells contracted. at four weeks we recovered about 2-4x106 cells, number that remained stable up to week 20. a population of cells secreting HEL-specific Igs was present in the spleen. we have also compared the patterns of gene expression (RNAseq) by nave, activated (YFP- cells of immunized mice) and both populations of YFP+ memory cells. the data shows a clear discrimination of nave and activated/memory cells. the % of apoptotic splenic B cell was assessed by flow cytometric analysis of active caspase 3 level 8 weeks after immunization. mRNA was isolated from sort-purified Nave (CD19+HEL+YFP-IgM+) IgM+IgG- or IgM-IgG+HEL+ memory B cells from spleen of different recipient mice. memory B cells are actively dividing cells Late in the immune response persistent B cell numbers were kept by active cell division as a significant fraction of the cells were Ki67+. the frequency of BrdU+ cells was higher among the AID/YFP- cells (15%) than in the major AID/YFP+ memory population (3%). the amplitude of the immune response was measured by measuring the serum titers of HEL-specific IgG antibodies and enumerating the number of HEL-specific B cells recovered. the levels of the HEL-specific IgGs (Fig 4A) and of memory YFP+ B cells recovered did not correlate to the number of antigen specific nave B cells initially transferred. 5x104 cells of either IgM+ or IgG+ memory B cells were transferred with an excess helper OTII CD4+ T cells into secondary Rag-deficient hosts. in the absence of immunization antibody levels were undetectable. three weeks after transfer recovery of both memory B cell subsets was about 10\u201320% of the initial cell input. cross-reactivity of the BCR transgene with environmental antigens may allow signaling sufficient to maintain nave and memory cell survival in a significant fraction of the memory B cells generated have a reduced expansion capacity being programmed for rapid differentiation for effector functions. these data suggest that a significant fraction of the memory B cells generated have a reduced expansion capacity being programmed for rapid differentiation for effector functions. memory B cells must maintain functional activity in the absence of nominal antigen to be fully effective. to test this we used an alternative approach where memory cells were parked in secondary Rag-deficient hosts for 30 days. ive cell transfer strategy to study the ability of the monoclonal B cell to reconstitute response in immune-deficient hosts. purified nave B cells from the SWHEL.AID/YFP.Rag2-/- mice were transferred into Rag2-deficient mice together with monoclonal OVA-specific CD4+ T helper cells from OTII.Rag2-/- transgenic mice. splenic B cells were injected intravenously with naive SWHEL.AID/YFP.Rag2-/- B cells together with naive CD4 T cells. immunized mice were immunized 24 hours later and B cell response analyzed 7, 14 days and 8 weeks after. left panel shows the % of Gl7hi CD95+ cells among AID/YFP- and AID/YFP+ (black bar) splenic B cell subsets from 14 day-immunized mice. data (mean SEM) are shown for one experiment representative of 3, with 4\u20135 mice per group. compared to nave B cells, AID/YFP+ cells expressed higher levels of CD80 and MHC class II and down-regulated expression of CXCR5. these findings indicate that post-germinal center AID/YFP+ cells express an activated phenotype [5, 21], have increased antigen-presenting capacity [22], but may loose the ability to re-enter primary follicles being CXCR5low [23] mRNA was isolated from sort-purified Nave (CD19+HEL+YFP-IgM+) or IgM-IgG+HEL+ CD19+YFP+ memory B cells from different recipient mice. mRNA quality and concentration were assessed using RNA 6000 Pico LabChips with a 2100 Bioanalyzer. g) was converted into a library of template molecules of known strand origin using the TruSeq Stranded total RNA sample preparation kit (Illumina) the validated libraries were then subjected to DNA sequencing. the analysis is performed using the R software, Bioconductor packages including DESeq2 and the PF2tools package. the number of memory B cells is independent the number of nave B cell progenitors. it is not yet known whether the number of antigen-experienced memory B cells correlated to the number of nave B cells. the number of splenic AID/YFP+ memory B cells recovered 8 weeks after immunization and the level of anti-HEL specific IgG in the serum are shown. the AID/YFP+IgM+ and AID/YFP+IgM-IgG+ antigen-experienced (memory) B cells persisting at late time points could mount secondary IgG responses. gM antibodies, little IgG antibodies, did generate GL7+ B cells more efficiently than the IgG+ memory B cell population. gM+ subset may contain precursors able to generate a secondary germinal center reaction and a new progeny of IgG+ effectors. the % of splenic Gl7 hi B cells in secondary hosts transferred with YFP+ IgM+ (white) or YFP+ IgG+ (black) B cells was analyzed by Flow Cytometry 3 weeks after immunization. in another settings, the different secondary hosts were immunized either 1 day (black circles) or 30 days (white circles) after transfer. we found the same high rate of proliferation for IgM+ and IgG+ memory B cells. compared life spans among heterogeneous memory B cells. a single clone the number of precursor naive B cells present in the peripheral B cell pool does determine neither the intensity nor the final number of memory B cells in response to an optimal dose of antigen. the limited niche for memory cells will imply strong competition among clones resulting in the selection of best fit (high affinity) cells. in our settings, the transgenic memory B cells are likely to counter select any new mutant clones since they express a very high affinity BCR selected in the course the maturation of follicular dendritic cells and the organization of lymphoid follicles may also modify their immediate environment. we recovered the memory B cell pool size present in the original donor mice. it is possible to fully reconstitute a primary response and the establishment of antibody memory in immune deficient mice. the recall responses were more efficient if the transferred memory cells were given the required time to adapt to their new environment. this suggests that a period of accommodation is necessary before the transferred cells are fully capable to respond."}
