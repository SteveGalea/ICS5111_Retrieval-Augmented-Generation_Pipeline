{"summary": "cryptosporidium parvum is a major cause of enteric disease, which is sometimes fatal, in calves and humans (1, 2). in Ireland, the parasite has been identified in over 25% of diarrheic calves examined in the Regional Veterinary Laboratories (3). since 2004, there has been a high incidence rate of cryptosporidiosis among humans in Ireland (5). e is best studied using multilocus subtyping techniques (11) the combined results obtained with polymorphic micro- and minisatellite markers are highly discriminatory for studying transmission dynamics. the main objective of the present study was to assess the transmission dynamics of C. parvum in Irish calves using gp60 gene sequencing and a multilocus subtyping approach. herd type (dairy, mixed, or beef), herd movement (number of calves bought in and sold from each herd during the year of testing, number of adult cattle bought in and sold from each herd during the same year) and location of parcels of land used by the farmer. the microscopic results from 2003 and 2004 were not available. a total of 5 l of diluted amplicon (diluted 1:50 using DNase-RNase-free water) was mixed with 5 l of a solution of a standard ladder (ET900-R size standard; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, United Kingdom), which was diluted with formamide (1:20). a total of 5 l of diluted amplicon was mixed with 5 l of a solution of a standard ladder (ET900-R size standard; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, sts at the RVLs were analyzed with STATA/MP (version 10.0) software (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX) for variables that may be associated with the presence of cryptosporidiosis in a herd. those with P values of 0.2 were considered for inclusion in the multivariable model. panmixia, where random mating occurred, leading to free genetic exchange. clonality, where there is relative genetic isolation leading to limited genetic exchange. clonality, where there is relative genetic isolation leading to limited genetic exchange. population subdivision was further analyzed without a priori definition of subpopulation boundaries by estimating the pairwise shared allele distance (DSA) between individual C. parvum MLSs. population structure was investigated using a multidimensional scaling plot. nucleotide sequences generated by multilocus subtyping were deposited in the GenBank database under accession number JX441324. each spring (March to April) from 2003 to 2005, fecal samples from neonatal diarrheic calves submitted to the RVLs for routine diagnostic purposes were examined for enteric pathogens. microsporidium species were identified using a nested PCR that amplified a segment of the small subunit rRNA gene followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) sequences were aligned with reference sequences from GenBank using lasergene software. a total of 5 l of diluted amplicon was mixed with 5 l of a solution of a standard ladder (ET900-R size standard; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, United Kingdom) the size of each amplicon was determined by separation on a capillary-based sequencer (MegaBACE 377; Applied Biosystems) each allele was purified using the ExoSAP-IT reagent (Affymetrix UK Ltd., United Kingdom) the multivariable model was built keeping variables with P values of 0.05 in the final model. the model fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic. a comparison between the parameters of models with 7 and 20 quadrature points was done (21). the presence of linkage disequilibrium across loci for each (sub)population was assessed using the Monte Carlo method with 10,000 allele randomizations (25) the index of association has a value of 0 for panmixia and a positive value if linkage disequilibrium is detected. the adegenet (version 1.3-4) package (propShared function) was implemented in R software. these pairwise distances were visualized using a classical multidimensional scaling plot. at least one animal positive for Cryptosporidium oocysts was detected in 29% of 944 herds from which fecal samples were examined. prevalence of cryptosporidiosis was the highest (35%) in the midwest of Ireland and was the lowest (18%) in the southeast. the sequencing of 14 randomly selected amplicons confirmed 100% sequence identity with the sequence with GenBank accession number AB441687. four samples collected in 2005 were identified as C. bovis (100% sequence identity with the sequence with GenBank accession number AY741305) one sample was identified as C. ryanae (100% sequence identity with the sequence with GenBank accession number AY587166) the mean size of the herds with cryptosporidiosis in at least one calf was higher than calf bought in 0.479 0.027a 0.053 0.905 Month of sampling 0.476 0.001a 0.203 0.749 Southeast vs southwest 0.242 0.425 0.836 0.352 Northwest vs southwest 0.945 0.007a 0.261 1.630 Midwest vs southwest 1.183 0.002a 0.428 1.937 Northeast vs southwest 0.308 0.367 0.361 0.976 North vs southwest 0.672 0.067 the majority (58%) of the samples were subtyped as IIaA18G3R1. 5% of the samples were identified as subtypes IIaA15G2R1, IIaA20G3R1 and IIaA19G3R1 respectively. one subtype, IIaA23G3R1, was identified for the first time. the gene diversity of the samples collected in the north (n = 2) was not included on account of the small sample size. the six spatial subpopulations comprise those from the northwest, midwest, southwest, southeast, northeast. 11 of the 205 herds had calves harboring different MLSs. d Analysis of IAS with inclusion of one MLS per (sub)population. e significant linkage disequilibrium (P 0.05) and VD > L. single-locus variant eBURST network for Cryptosporidium parvum population in Ireland (IE) each MLS is represented by a dot. the dot diameter is proportional to the number of isolates. values are given in the upper triangle and the P values are given in the lower triangle. c Significant at the 5% level following Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. the distribution of Cryptosporidium-negative () and -positive () Irish herds detected by microscopic assay in 2005 and the apparent prevalence (Pr) for each region are shown. a total of 283 of the 338 samples positive for Cryptosporidium spp. were also tested for other common neonatal enteropathogens. 1,323) and 60 cattle (SD, 69; range, 1 to 663), respectively. a higher mean number of herds with bought-in calves was observed in the east than in the other regions. the risk of cryptosporidiosis was the lowest in the southwest. the average nearest-neighbor analysis, the herds subtyped in 2005 (n = 56) were randomly distributed on the island. the spatial clustering analysis identified a cluster of four herds with MLS IE46 with a radius of circa 25 km. 6 herds infected with the C. parvum MLS IE46 and 50 herds infected with other MLS subtypes were included in the population genetics analysis. the remaining 245 samples had been collected from 205 herds. the number of alleles at each locus ranged from 1 for MS5 to 10 for GP15. the lowest genetic diversity was obtained in the northwest, and the highest value was obtained in the northeast. 0.036 0 MS5 1 0 0 0 Mean 0.291 0.310 0.307 0.307 0.322 0.392 a The gene diversity of the samples collected in the north was not included on account of the small sample size. the population of C. parvum in Ireland had a pan. eBURST network with star-like phylogeny showed a central founder (MLS IE32; bootstrap confidence = 89%) and 18 linked single-locus variants. five MLSs (IE02, IE32, IE32, IE39, IE46, and IE50) were represented in 45% of the samples. the overall for the entire data set was low (0.005) after the Bonferroni correction, the pairwise analysis indicated a low but significant genetic differentiation between the northeast and the western regions. similar results were obtained with or without samples with biallelic profiles. the gp60 sequencing increased the discriminatory power compared with that obtained by the gp15 sizing method. all the analyses were repeated with gp60 (instead of gp15) in the MLS and showed similar results (not presented) the sample of the C. parvum population collected from Irish neonatal calves presented a panmictic structure, suggesting random mating regardless of genetic or environmental factors. a high prevalence of more than one strain of the parasite on the island would increase the likelihood of coinfection with genetically heterogeneous parasites and recombination. however, it was surprising to find a smaller number of mixed infections than in other European studies (13, 19, 32) this might be due to the geographical isolation of Ireland. inbreeding occurs in regions with high rates of transmission, while inbreeding predominates in areas with low rates of transmission (38). the spatial cluster of MLS IE46 detected in county Limerick may be explained by its topographic isolation, being surrounded by a river and mountains. the high prevalence of C. parvum in calves and the predominance of subtypes identified in humans in Ireland indicated that there is a risk of zoonotic transmission. however, both humans and animals can contribute to the contamination of surface waters and continuously infect each other."}
