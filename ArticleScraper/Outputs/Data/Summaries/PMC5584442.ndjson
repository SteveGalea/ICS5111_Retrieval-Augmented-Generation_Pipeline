{"summary": "we engineered variants based on previously determined structure of the trimeric S protein from the lineage A betacoronavirus HCoV-HKU1 (18) proline substitutions in the loop between the first heptad repeat (HR1) and the central helix restrict premature triggering of the fusion protein and often increase expression yields of prefusion ectodomains. helix-turn-helix between heptad repeat 1 and the central helix. the residues colored red are those mutated to proline to retain S2 in the prefusion conformation. each protein was produced from a 1-L transfection. each protein was produced from 500 mL FreeStyle 293-F cells. to investigate the effect of the 2P substitutions on S protein function, MERS-CoV pseudoviruses were generated with WT or 2P-containing S proteins. MERS-CoV pseudoviruses encoding a luciferase reporter gene were generated with WT (S WT, blue) or 2P (S-2P, red) S proteins. infectivity in Huh7.5 cells was determined by measuring RLU. MERS S-2P elicited significantly more robust neutralizing activity than S1 against four of the six homologous MERS-CoV pseudoviruses tested. the vaccination also elicited greater neutralization than S WT against three of the six homologous MERS-CoV pseudoviruses tested. the cryo-EM density maps were less well-resolved in regions of the S1 NTD, as was the case in the recently determined structure of the SARS-CoV S protein (20). both of these X-ray structures were used in further refinement of the cryo-EM\u2013derived models. ryo-EM data collection Microscope FEI Titan Krios Voltage, kV 300 Detector Gatan K2 Summit Recording mode Counting Magnification (including postmagnification) 49,020 Movie micrograph pixel size, 1.02 Dose rate, e/[(camera pixel)*s] 10 No. of frames per movie micrograph 35 Frame exposure time, ms 200 Movie micrograph exposure time, s 7 Total dose, e/2 66 De 127 111 43 111 93 75 94 129 81 Structure building and validation N/A N/A N/A No. of atoms in deposited model 28,863 31,077 31,085 32,916 27,981 32,916 33,798 32,835 S1 4,010 5,655 5,655 5,655 5,655 5,655 5,642 S2 3,535 3,535 3,535 3,535 3,535 3,535 3,535 3,535 3,535 3,535 3,5 the structure of the MERS-CoV S1 NTD can be separated into top, core and bottom regions (86) the two -sheets of the NTD core are colored green and magenta, and the rest of the NTD is colored cyan.

G4 recognizes a variable loop in the S2 connector domain. Residues 1171\u20131187 of MERS S-2P are shown as a ribbon. side chains of interacting residues are shown as sticks. the exposed loop is variable in sequence and length, even among lineage C betacoronaviruses. the variability in this loop is reminiscent of the variable loops found in HIV-1 gp120, which arise as a result of pressure exerted by the host antibody response. G4-escape data identify a variable loop in S2 that is likely under immune pressure and can be removed to potentially avoid virus-specific antibodies in a vaccine antigen designed to elicit protection against multiple coronaviruses. we identified a small subpopulation of cryo-EM data (5.4%) in the tightly packed \u201cclosed\u201d conformation. the 2P substitutions do not interact with the RBD and allow Arg1057 in HR1 to maintain its interaction with Tyr577 in the RBD. MERS-CoV S assumes both open (DPP4-accessible) and closed (DPP4-inaccessible) conformations. a small fraction of the data (5.4%) exists in an open conformation characterized by having at least one RBD \u201cout\u201d the model posits that all three RBDs are in a state of equilibrium. DPP4 binding acts as a molecular ratchet that locks the RBD in the \u201cout\u201d conformation until all three RBDs are bound. this open conformation of the trimer is unstable and the S1 subunits ultimately dissociate from S2. s at residues V1060 and L1061 (hereafter referred to as \u201c2P\u201d) resulted in a >50-fold improvement in yield (Fig. 1C and Fig. S1A) the 2P variant maintained prototypic prefusion morphology (Fig. 1D) two-dimensional class averages of negative stained MERS S-WT, MERS S-2P, SARS S-WT, and SARS S-2P. for the 2P mutants only the prefusion conformation is observed. reactivity of polyclonal sera and conformation-dependent antibodies was assessed by flow cytometry. cells expressing the RBD fused to a transmembrane domain only reacted with the polyclonal sera and D12 antibody. all three antibodies also bound to the recombinant MERS-CoV S protein ectodomains containing the 2P substitutions. MERS S-2P trimer elicited neutralizing antibodies to the autologous England1 strain of MERS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner. each of the immunogens elicited neutralizing antibodies to the autologous England1 strain of MERS-CoV in a dose-dependent manner. the geometric mean IC90 titer (GMT) of each group is represented by (A) symbols or (B) bars. the limit of detection for the assay is represented by dotted lines. for sera below the limit of detection a reciprocal IC90 titer of 10 was assigned. a single protomer of the trimeric S protein is shown in ribbon representation. the two remaining protomers are shown as molecular surfaces and colored white and gray.

Arg1179 is critical for G4 binding, as it forms a cation\u2013 interaction with HCDR2 Tyr53 as well as a salt bridge with HCDR1 Asp31. a majority of the data (69.6%) contained two G4 Fabs bound to the MERS S-2P spike (A) and the remaining data (30.4%) contained three bound G4 Fabs (B). the loop is variable in sequence and length, even among lineage C betacoronaviruses. G4 circumvents the glycan mask via its angle of approach. this allows G4 to recognize the membrane-proximal face of the loop. this allows G4 to avoid the glycan moieties attached to Asn1176. requirement for this constrained approach likely comes at a cost to binding affinity. ITC data for binding of G4 Fab to MERS S-2P (A), deglycosylated MERS S-2P (B), and variable-loop-mutated MERS S-2P (C) red lines represent best fit of the data to a single-binding-site model. 5W9N 5W9O 5W9H 5W9K EM data processing No. of movie micrographs 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 813 No. of molecular projection images in map 37,180 37,180 8,496 9,333 8,133 11,218 11,218 1, 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (0.01%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 0 (0%) 2 (0.01%) Bond angles 93 (0.52%) 147 (0.73%) 136 (0.68%) 126 (0.63%) 142 (0.67%) 75 (0.42%) 108 (0.51%) 127 (0.60%) 122 (0.57%) Ramachandran plot Favored, % 95.0 94.7 96.1 95.9 95.4 94.5 73.0\u20131.57 (1.59\u20131.57) Unique reflections 31,250 (2,595) 128,598 (4,250) Rwork/Rfree, % 19.1/22.2 18.2/21.5 No. of atoms Protein 2,703 6,573 Ligand/ion 157 6 Water 411 953 B-factors, 2 Protein 25.7 25.8 Ligand/ion 44.0 35.0 Water 35.5 38.3 Rmsd Bond lengths, 0.004 0.006 Bond the 2P substitutions do not interact with the RBD and allow Arg1057 in HR1 to maintain its interaction with Tyr577 in the RBD. in the remaining three subpopulations of our cryo-EM data, \u201copen\u201d trimers are observed with one, two, or three RBDs in an \u201cout\u201d conformation. MERS-CoV S assumes both open (DPP4-accessible) and closed (DPP4-inaccessible) conformations. a small fraction of the data (5.4%) exists in an open conformation characterized by having at least one RBD \u201cout\u201d. a new tab posits that all three RBDs are in a state of equilibrium. DPP4 binding acts as a molecular ratchet that locks the RBD in the \u201cout\u201d conformation until all three RBDs are bound. this open conformation of the trimer is unstable and the S1 subunits ultimately dissociate from S2. proline substitution has found broad use in subunit vaccine development. for HIV-1 Env, the I559P substitution in gp41 helped to produce a stable ectodomain trimer designated \u201cSOSIP\u201d (32), which facilitated the high-resolution structural analysis of this critical vaccine target. the fusion peptide of HIV-1 Env (47, 48) is relatively conserved among coronaviruses. an antibody that recognizes this region of the S2 stem may neutralize diverse coronaviruses. an antibody that recognizes this region of the S2 stem may broadly neutralize diverse coronaviruses. a single RBD was observed in the receptor-accessible \u201cout\u201d conformation (20, 18) all three RBDs were shown to be in a tightly packed, closed configuration (17, 18) the MHV spike may not need to transiently expose the RBDs since it binds to its protein receptor CEACAM1 via the S1 NTD (53\u201355), and this interaction is thought to be sufficient for entry (56). a mammalian-codon-optimized gene encoding MERS-CoV S residues 1\u20131291 with a C-terminal T4 fibritin trimerization domain, an HRV3C cleavage site, an 8xHis-tag and a Twin-Strep-tag was synthesized and subcloned into the eukaryotic-expression vector pH. kifunensine was added to a final concentration of 5 0.5\u20131 L FreeStyle 293-F cells were transfected. three hours after transfection, kifunensine was added to a final concentration of 5 M. protein was purified from the supernatant using a supernatant. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S-2P proteins were diluted with Tris-buffered saline as necessary and then stained with 1% uranyl acetate. grids were imaged in a Tecnai T12 Spirit with a high tension of 120 kV. each micrograph was collected in counting mode at 29,000 nominal magnification. a dose rate of 10 e per (camera pixel) per s was used. each movie frame was captured from an exposure time of 200 ms. resulting local RBD density projection images were subjected to RELION 3D classification using the homogeneous density map (no density in the RBD area that is to be classified) the original raw projection images were then recompiled into four conformationally clean data classes corresponding to three RBD \u201cin\u201d or the \u201cout\u201d position. each of the four classes was individually refined against a reference map at 60 simulated from our MERS S-2P coordinate build. X-ray structures for MERS S1 NTD and MERS S1 RBD (PDB ID code 4KR0) were used to substitute the respective regions. the resulting models were then iteratively refined and manually rebuilt against their respective density maps. the supernatant was passed over a Protein A agarose column. after 12 h, the column was washed with PBS and the NTD was eluted. the NTD was further purified using a superdex 75 column. crystals were soaked in reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the SSRL beamline BL14-1. a molecular replacement solution for the G4 Fab data was obtained. folic acid is thought to have copurified with the NTD from the mammalian expression medium. folic acid has a physiological role in the MERS-CoV infection cycle remains unknown. female mice aged 6\u20138 wk were immunized with MERS S1, MERS S WT, or MERS S-2P protein at 0 and 3 wk. protein (0.1 g, 1 g, or 10 g) was mixed 1:1 with 2 Sigma Adjuvant System. HEK293T cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. to produce MERS-CoV pseudoviruses, CMV/R-MERS-CoV spike plasmids were produced by omitting the MERS-CoV S plasmid. eight dilutions were mixed with various pseudovirus strains. titers were calculated considering uninfected cells as 100% neutralization. cells transduced with only virus as 0% neutralization. -2P, or variable-loop-deleted MERS S-2P were performed using a PEAQ isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) at 25 \u00b0C. protein concentrations in the sample cell were 3.0\u20133.7 M, whereas the concentration of G4 Fab in the injection syringe was 57.5 M. RT-PCR using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) and Easy-A high-fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies) were subjected to dideoxy sequencing using S gene-based primers. reads were aligned to the native EMC/2012 S-gene sequence (GenBank accession no. JX869059.2) using MacVector. protein-bound resin was boiled and loaded per lane. similar strategies were used to generate and test proline-substituted variants. 0.5\u20131 L FreeStyle 293-F cells were transfected. MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV S-2P proteins were diluted with Tris-buffered saline as necessary. grids were imaged in a Tecnai T12 Spirit with a high tension of 120 kV and a complementary metal-oxide semiconductor camera at 52,000 magnification. each micrograph was collected in counting mode at 29,000 nominal magnification. a dose rate of 10 e per (camera pixel) per s was used. each movie frame was captured from an exposure time of 200 ms. three masks each encompassing both the \u201cin\u201d and the \u201cout\u201d configuration at respective RBD positions were created. subtraction of the homogeneous density region from raw projection images was then obtained by projecting the homogeneous density map according to the projection image Euler directions already obtained from refinement. an initial model of MERS S-2P was obtained from the MODELLER homology modeling tool (66) in UCSF Chimera (67) using HCoV-HKU1 S (PDB ID code 5I08) as a template. significant manual remodeling as well as de novo building of the S2 domain that connects the central helix with HR2 was performed in coot (68) kifunensine was added to a final concentration of 5 M. after 6 d, the supernatant was passed over a Protein A agarose column. after 12 h, the column was washed with PBS and the NTD was eluted. crystals were soaked in reservoir solution supplemented with 20% (vol/vol) glycerol and frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the SSRL beamline BL14-1 (Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource, SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory) folic acid is thought to have copurified with the NTD from the mammalian expression medium. folic acid has a physiological role in the MERS-CoV infection cycle. female mice aged 6\u20138 wk were immunized with MERS S1, MERS S WT, or MERS S-2P protein at 0 and 3 wk. protein (0.1 g, 1 g, or 10 g) diluted in PBS was mixed 1:1 with 2 Sigma Adjuvant System. HEK293T cells were obtained from ATCC and cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM glutamine, and 1% penicillin/streptomycin at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2. to produce MERS-CoV pseudoviruses, CMV/R-MERS-CoV spike plasmids were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. dilutions of mouse sera (1:40, fourfold, eight dilutions) were mixed with various pseudovirus strains, which were previously titered to target 50,000 RLU. 90% neutralization (IC90) titers were calculated considering uninfected cells as 100% neutralization. s of G4 Fab into MERS S-2P, deglycosylated MERS S-2P, or variable-loop-deleted MERS S-2P were performed using a PEAQ isothermal titration calorimeter (ITC) at 25 \u00b0C. protein concentrations in the sample cell were 3.0\u20133.7 M, while the concentration of G4 Fab in the injection syringe was 57.5 M. two overlapping cDNA amplicons encompassing the entire S gene were generated by RT-PCR using SuperScript III RT (Invitrogen) and Easy-A high-fidelity thermostable DNA polymerase (Agilent Technologies). reads were aligned to the native EMC/2012 S-gene sequence (GenBank accession no.
