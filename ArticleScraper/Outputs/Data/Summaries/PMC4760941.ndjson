{"summary": "traditional (first-generation) smallpox vaccines are inoculated into vaccine recipients by scarification of the skin surface. rare but severe adverse reactions caused by these vaccines limit the use of these vaccines for routine preventative vaccination of the general population in the absence of any immediate risk of exposure to variola virus. recombinant MVA vectors expressing heterologous proteins of different human pathogens are at various phases of clinical development. some of the MVA-vectored vaccines in clinical trials include those expressing human immunodeficiency virus antigens [22,23, 24], mycobacterium tuberculosis 85A antigen [25,26,27], malaria antigens [28,29,30], human papilloma virus antigens [31], recombinant vaccinia virus is inoculated into subjects via intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes. a relatively large inoculum volume of 0.05 to 0.10mL and 0.5 to 1mL of MVA or recombinant MVA is typically used in small animal models and in non-human primates/humans. this often results in local reactions at the site of inoculation, including muscle ache, pain, and tenderness. ko virus conferred comparable levels of protection on mice as those vaccinated with a clonal isolate of Dryvax, DV-3. percutaneous inoculation of recombinant MVA elicited protective immune responses against lethal intranasal challenge with the Western Reserve (WR) strain of vaccinia virus. recombinant MVA expressing the hemagglutinin (H5) of influenza virus rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) (MVA-HA) was constructed by homologous recombination of the H5 gene into the deletion III region of MVA [53]. expression of the influenza H5 is driven by the vaccinia H5R promoter. partially purified viruses were obtained by passing infected cell lysates through mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1x avertin. the inoculum was diluted in sterile endotoxin-free phosphate-buffered saline. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1x avertin (20 L per gram body weight), followed by inoculation of the challenge virus in a total of 20 L suspension into the nares. mice that lost 25% of their initial body weight were considered to have reached the study endpoint. plates were washed with phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.5% Tween-20 (PBST) plates were then blocked with PBST containing 10% fetal bovine serum for 2 hours. testing of antisera for the neutralization of influenza A virus rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was performed using a microneutralization assay as previously described. a p value 0.05 indicates statistically significant differences between treatment groups. recombinant MVA expressing the hemagglutinin (H5) of influenza virus rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was constructed by homologous recombination of the H5 gene into the deletion III region of MVA. partially purified viruses were obtained by passing infected cell lysates through a 36% sucrose cushion. the attenuated influenza virus rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 (H5N1) was grown in the allantoic cavity of embryonated eggs and titrated on MDCK cells. mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 1x avertin (20 L per gram body weight), followed by inoculation of the challenge virus in a total of 20 L suspension into the nares (10L per naris) we previously determined this dose to be lethal in our influenza virus challenge model. ELISA for vaccinia-specific antibodies was performed using psoralen/UV-inactivated vaccinia virus (Dryvax) as the antigen. HSV-2 gD-specific IgG ELISA was performed using partially-purified HSV-2 glycoproteins (50 ng/well) as the antigen, and HSV-2 neutralization assay were performed in 96-well Immulon 2HB plates. control group was vaccinated with 107 pfu of MVA. mice were euthanized, spleens were collected from dissected mice. lymphocytes were isolated from spleen homogenates as previously described. groups of mice were vaccinated with 105 pfu of the licensed smallpox vaccine. an untreated group was included as a control. the untreated mice and all mice in the MVA intramuscular group had no detectable IgG. mice in the MVA percutaneous group recovered more quickly. average peak weight loss was 8.8% (day-5), 7.7% (day-6) and 6.2% (day-6) mice in groups of five were vaccinated with 103 pfu or 105 pfu of MVA. each virus was administered via intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC) or percutaneous (PC) routes. a mouse with below detection level of IgG was assigned a titer of 1.0 (log10). -gD2 elicits HSV-2-specific immune responses MVA is an attractive vector being used for the expression of transgenes. preclinical and clinical evaluation of MVA-vectored vaccines in development has relied predominantly on intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes of MVA delivery. the mean IgG titers (log10) after the priming vaccinations were 1.60 (0.82 standard deviation (SD), 2.08 (0.66 SD), and 2.81 (0.21 SD) in the three dosage groups vaccinated via the percutaneous route, mean IgG titers (log10) of 2.02 (0.62 SD), 2.44 (0.49 SD), and 2.56 (0.25 SD) were obtained. groups of mice were vaccinated with MVA-gD2 at doses of 105, 106 or 107 pfu. antisera obtained from mice 3 weeks after first vaccination (week 3) and 3 weeks after second vaccination (week 6) were tested for HSV-2 gD-specific IgG by ELISA.

IgG levels between subcutaneous and percutaneous cohorts were not statistically significant, although mean IgG titers were slightly higher in the subcutaneous cohort. all mice in the MVA group succumbed to infection and all mice vaccinated with MVA-HA survived with varying degrees of morbidity. neutralizing antibody was below detection in post-prime antisera, except in the 107 pfu subcutaneous group where a titer of 10 was obtained. all treatment groups had detectable levels of neutralizing antibody that increased with increase in vaccine dose. neutralizing antibody titers were 15, 60, 80, and 104, 105, and 106 pfu. the levels of neutralizing antibody were similar to the subcutaneous group at the same MVA-HA dosage, in spite of slightly higher total H5-specific IgG levels in the subcutaneous cohort. all mice vaccinated with 103 pfu MVA-HA in this prime/boost schedule survived. in the 102 pfu MVA-HA group, 2/5 and 1/5 survived in the subcutaneous and percutaneous groups. control groups received 104 pfu of MVA subcutaneously or percutaneously. none of the mice vaccinated with MVA survived in the 102 pfu, 103 pfu and 104 pfu vaccination groups. groups of mice were vaccinated with a single dose of MVA-HA. all mice were challenged with influenza rgA/Viet Nam/1203/2004 virus three weeks after vaccination and weighed daily for 2 weeks. each data point is the average of two independent experiments. US-licensed second-generation smallpox vaccine, ACAM2000, is also administered by skin scarification, a procedure that is believed to be partly responsible for the success of the global eradication of smallpox by provoking robust innate and adaptive immune responses. despite the severe attenuation of MVA, clinical investigations of MVA-vectored vaccines have mostly used intramuscular [23,34,35,36] and intradermal routes. vaccine delivery through the skin takes advantage of the abundant presence of skin-resident antigen-presenting cells, including dendritic cells and Langerhans cells. data suggest both live and subunit vaccines can be administered through the skin, with successful immunization outcomes [67\u201371, 73,74] compared the antibody response elicited in response to MVA and two recombinant MVAs. the intramuscular route elicited higher geometric mean titers of antibody. the difference may be due to differences in experimental procedures and assay methods. -gD2 may be more effective than subcutaneous inoculation in eliciting HSV-2 neutralizing antibodies at lower vaccine doses. recombinant MVA vectors expressing influenza antigens have been shown to elicit protective immune responses in animal models. a more comprehensive investigation of the clinical benefit of delivering MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines through the skin is necessary. microneedle delivery of vaccines by skin scarification has been shown to be effective in eliciting robust immune responses against malaria [90]. at four weeks post-vaccination, mice were challenged with 25 LD50 of VV-WR, intranasally. the percentages of surviving mice are shown (B)."}
