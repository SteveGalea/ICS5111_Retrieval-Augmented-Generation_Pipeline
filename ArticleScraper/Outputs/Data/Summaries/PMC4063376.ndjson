{"summary": "anti-rabies equine immunoglobulin is defunct, precipitating a worldwide shortage of anti-rabies immunoglobulin. this has particularly impacted developing countries since concerns about the safety of animal-derived products have been raised. a shortage of vaccines and immunoglobulins has put rabies patients in danger. plant genetic engineering can be applied to express valuable recombinant biopharmaceutical proteins on an industrial scale. the advantages of plant expression systems include large-scale production capacity, lack of animal pathogen contamination, and low cost of biomass production. multiple monoclonal antibodies can be expressed in a single plant via cross-fertilization between individual transgenic plants that express different target-binding monoclonal antibodies. chimeric IgG1/IgA and Fab and single-chain variable fragment (scFV) genes have been successfully expressed in plants. recombinant therapeutic antibodies for the treatment of infectious diseases and cancer have been produced in transgenic plant systems. glycosylation modifies biological activities of antibodies by regulating stability, CDC, and ADCC. e Nicotiana tabacum Yusibov et al., 1997 Rabies virus peptide CPDrg24 Spinacea oleraceae Modelska et al., 1998 Rabies glycoprotein and nucleoprotein Nicotiana benthamiana Yusibov et al., 1998 Hepatitis B antigen Lupinus luteus Kapusta et al., 1999 Hepatitis B antigen Lactuca s smallpox B5 antigenic domain (pB5) Nicotiana tabacum Golovkin et al., 2007 Smallpox B5 antigenic domain (pB5) Brassica oleracea Golovkin et al., 2007 Tumor-associated colorectal cancer antigen Nicotiana tabacum Brodzik et al., 2008 Hepatitis B core protein Nicotiana tabacum Bandurska, 2008 Diphtheria-Tet recombinant vaccines are achievable through harmonization of plant genetic engineering with molecular immunology. there are two administration strategies: intravenous use of recombinant vaccine protein purified from plant biomass and oral administration of the edible part of plants expressing recombinant vaccine protein without downstream purification processes. plant-derived recombinant virus-like particles carrying the chimeric hybrid tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) coat protein and a 13 amino acid sequence of the murine zona pellucida ZP3 protein induced an immune response to the ZP3 epitope in mice. several concerns need to be addressed, including loss of immunogenicity or degradation in the gastrointestinal microenvironment. plant-specific paucimannosidic type N-glycans are considered to be typical vacuolar N-glycans. they are modified oligosaccharides containing only an (1,3)-Fuc linked to the GlcNAc and/or a (1,2)-Xyl attached to the -Man residue of Man3GlcNAc2 or Man2GlcNAc2. the global pharmaceutical market is estimated to grow to $1.3 trillion by the most terminal glycan residues of mammalian glycoproteins are sialic acids linked to terminal (1,4)- or (1,3)-Gal residues. a knock-in strategy can be applied to express human (1,4)-galactosyltransferase for elongation with (1,4)-galactose in plants. lycan residues from several therapeutic recombinant proteins improve half-life and biological activity. second approach is to retain recombinant proteins in the ER before transferring them to the Golgi complex where plant-specific glycan structures mature. oligomannose-type N-glycans are commonly found in both plants and mammals. arabidopsis thaliana mutant deficient in the glycosyltransferase I can accumulate mainly oligomannose structures Man5GlcNAc2 carrying terminal GlcNAc residues on both (1,3)- and (1,6)-linked Mans without the allergenic and immunogenic plant specific (1,3)-Fuc and (1,2)-Xyl. research supported by grants from the Korea Institute of Planning and Evaluation for Technology of Food, Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries. author has no financial interests to disclose."}
