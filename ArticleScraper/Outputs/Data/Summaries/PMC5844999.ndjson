{"summary": "in humans, coVs were recognized as typically causing colds and pneumonia until the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2002 and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012 from zoonotic sources (1, 2). Efforts to treat SARS patients with existing antivirals did not conclusively provide a clinical benefit. previously tested nucleoside analogues have been incapable of potently inhibiting CoV replication. some previously tested nucleoside analogues have demonstrated poor selectivity indexes (20, 21) coV resistance to the mutagens 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and ribavirin (RBV) in vitro is attributed to their removal by the proofreading ExoN (22) side GS-441524 resulted in phenotypic resistance associated with two nonsynonymous mutations in the predicted fingers domain of the nsp12 RNA polymerase. the engineered mutations in the MHV cloned background closely recapitulated the partial resistance phenotype and restored RNA levels in the presence of GS-5734. however, resistant viruses could not compete with WT MHV during in vitro coinfection passage in the absence GS-441524 is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of GS-441524. change in viral titer of MHV compared to vehicle control after treatment with GS-5734. data represent the results from 4 independent experiments, each with 3 replicates. treatment with increasing concentrations of GS-5734 resulted in up to a 6-log10 decrease in viral titer. GS-5734 inhibited MHV more potently than GS-441524. GS-5734 inhibited MHV more potently than GS-441524. EC50 values for both viruses were 0.86 M for GS-441524 and 0.074 M for GS-5734. delaying addition of GS-5734 until 24 hours postinfection resulted in decreased viral titer in HAE cultures. culturesa GS-441524 GS-5734 EC50 (M) CC50 (M) EC50 (M) CC50 (M) MERS 0.86 0.78 >100 0.074 0.023 >10 SARS 0.18 0.14 >100 0.069 0.036 >10 a Values represent the average (mean SD) from at least three donors. increasing concentrations of GS-5734 resulted in decreased viral RNA levels that correlated with the decrease in titer we observed. these results suggest that GS-5734 inhibits CoVs early after infection by interfering with viral RNA replication. the data represent the results from 2 independent experiments, each with 3 replicates. exoN() MHV demonstrated up to a 100-fold greater reduction in viral titer at 0.25 M GS-5734 compared to WT virus. the calculated EC50 for exoN() virus in this experiment was 0.019 M, a 4.5-fold decrease compared to the WT EC50 of 0.087 M. this increased sensitivity of GS-5734 is similar to that of other nucleoside analogues and suggests that GS- three lineages of MHV were serially passaged in the presence of increasing concentrations of GS-441524. GS-441524 and GS-441524 are both metabolized to the same active triphosphate metabolite (27) but GS-441524 provided a larger working range of concentrations. recombinant MHV containing either F476L or V553L individually was less sensitive to GS-5734 than WT MHV. MHV encoding both F476L and V553L showed a resistance pattern comparable to p23. compared to p23 virus population, MHV showed 2.4-fold resistance to GS-5734. mutations in the predicted fingers domain of the nsp12 RdRp, F476L and V553L, arose after 23 passages in the presence of GS-441524. mutations in the predicted fingers domain of the nsp12 arose after 23 passages in the presence of GS-441524. these residues are completely conserved across CoVs. change in RNA levels of WT, F476L, V553L, and F476L + V553L MHV normalized to vehicle control after treatment with GS-5734. data represent results from 2 independent experiments, each with 3 replicates. GS-5734 resistance mutations impair competitive fitness of MHV. we first determined the replication capacity of recombinant MHV carrying the F476L, V553L, and F476L + V553L mutations. each of these viruses replicate similarly to WT MHV. WT SARS-CoV demonstrated dose-dependent inhibition by GS-5734. the recombinant virus was inhibited by GS-5734, with an EC50 of 0.06 M. these results support the conclusion that conserved residues across divergent CoVs reflect conserved functions impaired by GS-5734. GS-5734-resistant SARS-CoV is attenuated in vivo. the data are representative of the results from 2 independent experiments. asterisks represent SEM. if GS-441524 inhibited the model -2a CoV, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), we infected delayed brain tumor (DBT) cells with MHV and treated them with increasing concentrations of drug. we observed a dose-dependent reduction in viral titer with up to a 6-log10 decrease at 11.1 M GS-441524. GS-441524 and GS-5734 potently inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in HAE cells. primary human airway epithelial cell cultures are among the most clinically relevant in vitro models of the lung. previous results have demonstrated that GS-5734 inhibits the viral titer of multiple CoVs. EC50 and CC50 values of GS-441524 or GS-5734. values represent the average (mean SD) from HAE cultures from at least three donors. GS-5734 acts at early times postinfection to decrease viral RNA levels. GS-5734 was added between 2 h preinfection and 2 h postinfection. inhibition was detected when GS-5734 was added between 4 and 6 h postinfection. no inhibition was observed when GS-5734 was added after 8 h postinfection. the data represent the results from 2 independent experiments, each with 3 replicates. asterisk bars represent SEM compared to DMSO-treated samples. GS-5734 is incorporated into viral RNA and can be removed by ExoN. a change in viral titer of WT and ExoN() viruses normalized to vehicle control after treatment with GS-5734. the data represent the results from 2 independent experiments, each with 3 replicates. the nsp13 helicase (A335V), the ns2 2\u2032,5\u2032 phosphodiesterase (Q67H), the spike glycoprotein (A34V and I924T) and the nsp12 RdRp (F476L and V553L) both the F476 and V553 residues reside within the predicted fingers domain of the conserved right-hand structure of the RdRp (Fig. 5C) MHV, the F476L virus showed 2.4-fold resistance to GS-5734, and V553L virus demonstrated 5-fold resistance to GS-5734. combined mutations mediated 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734 based on EC50 values. results are consistent with a mechanism of action of GS-5734. the data represent the results from 2 independent experiments, each with 3 replicates. asterisks: *, P 0.05; **, P 0.01. Statistical significance compared to WT at each concentration was determined by one-way ANOVA. GS-5734 resistance mutations confer up to 5.6-fold resistance to GS-5734 in MHVa Virus EC50 (M) Fold resistance WT 0.024 0.011 1 F476L 0.12 0.06 5.0 F476L + V553L 0.13 0.06 5.6 a Mean EC50 values SD and fold resistance of GS-5734-resistant viruses. mutations identified in GS-5734-resistant MHV confer resistance in SARS-CoV. mutations confer resistance and are attenuated in GS-5734. mutations identified in GS-5734-resistant MHV also confer resistance in SARS-CoV. data from panel A presented as the percentage of vehicle control. this EC50 value was calculated as 0.01 M for WT and 0.06 M for F480L + V557L virus. the data are representative of the results from 2 independent experiments. by 4 days postinfection, lung viral titers were significantly reduced (P 0.05) in mice infected with F480L + V557L SARS-CoV. together, these data demonstrate that GS-5734-resistant SARS-CoV is attenuated in its ability to cause disease. GS-5734 has been reported to cause premature termination of nascent RNA transcripts by the purified RSV polymerase. but the mechanism of inhibition of other viral polymerases has not been fully explored. GS-5734 is 3 to 30 times more active than GS-441524 in all of the coVs we tested. MHV and SARS-CoV strains lacking the proofreading activity of ExoN [ExoN()] were more sensitive to 5-FU and RBV, underscoring the role of exoN-mediated proofreading in resistance to inhibition by these compounds (22). this resistance to potent inhibition by RBV and 5-FU has been attributed to the CoV nsp14 proofreading exoribonuclease. previous studies have assessed inhibition by GS-5734 in multiple viruses. none have reported resistance mutations during treatment. a similar level of resistance was observed for homologous F476L and V553L substitutions in SARS-CoV. in vitro biochemical system demonstrating polymerase and exoribonuclease activities suggests it may be possible to define specific effects of GS-5734 resistance mutations on polymerase and RNA proofreading activities. it will be important to determine if other proteins contribute to resistance, as well as using GS-5734 as a probe to define protein interactions and functions within the viral replicase. recombinant MHV containing both F476L and V553L replicated similarly to WT in parallel cultures failed to compete with WT MHV during coinfection. fitness impairment was further evidenced in vivo by attenuation of F480L + V557L virus in a mouse model. this fitness impairment may be due to alterations in RNA replication, fidelity, nucleotide incorporation, or protein stability. GS-5734 has been reported to cause premature termination of nascent RNA transcripts by the purified RSV polymerase. but the mechanism of inhibition of other viral polymerases has not been fully explored. GS-5734 is 4.5 times more active against MHV lacking the proofreading activity of ExoN. exoN-mediated proofreading in resistance to inhibition by these compounds (22) suggests that to effectively inhibit CoVs, nucleoside analogues would need to inhibit ExoN directly, be incorporated so efficiently that the 5\u2032-3\u2032 elongation reaction is much faster than the ExoN cleavage reaction. this mechanism has been proposed for sensitivity of herpes simplex virus (HSV) to acyclovir. a similar level of resistance was observed for the homologous F480L and V557L substitutions in SARS-CoV. the mechanism of resistance to GS-5734 remains to be determined. a similar level of resistance was observed for the homologous F480L and V557L substitutions in nsp12 core polymerase-coding region. recombinant MHV containing the F476L and V553L mutations recapitulated the GS-5734 resistance phenotype of passage 23 virus population. however, these results do not eliminate the possibility that other potential pathways to GS-5734 resistance may exist. GS-5734 resistance is associated with a fitness cost in vitro and attenuation in vivo. resistant virus suffers a loss of competitive fitness in vitro and attenuation in animals. these mutations will not favor disease emergence and are likely to be poorly maintained in nature, particularly during acute infections. the results argue strongly for the continued clinical development of GS-5734. human tracheobronchial epithelial cells were obtained from airway specimens resected from patients undergoing surgery. primary cells were expanded to generate passage 1 cells, and passage 2 cells were plated at a density of 250,000 cells per well. all work with MHV was performed using the recombinant strain MHV-A59 (GenBank accession no. AY910861) ability was determined using a Veritas microplate luminometer (Promega) values normalized to those of untreated cells. MHV sensitivity to GS-441524 and GS-5734 was measured. cells were infected with the indicated virus at a multiplicity of infection. fully mature HAE cultures were obtained from the UNC Tissue Core. at 48 h prior to infection the apical surface of the cultures washed with 500 l 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C, and the cultures were moved into wells containing fresh air-liquid interface (ALI) medium (56) cultures were harvested at 48 h post-drug treatment, which was 72 h postinfection. subconfluent monolayers of DBT cells were infected with the indicated virus at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. lineages 2 and 3 were lost after p17 and p20, respectively. lineage 1 demonstrated an increase in visible CPE. lineage 1 was carried to passage 23. RNA was harvested from infected cell monolayers. a 1,450-bp cassette encoding resistance substitutions (F480L and V557L) was synthesized by bioBasic, Inc. the cassette was then cloned into the SARS-CoV D infectious cDNA plasmid. the subsequent selected clone was sequence verified across the cassette. mice were anesthetized with ketamine-xylazine and intranasally infected with either 104 or 103 PFU/50 l wild-type mouse-adapted SARS-CoV expressing nanoluciferase. animals were weighed daily to monitor virus-associated weight loss. human lung epithelial cell line Calu-3 (clone 2B4) was donated by C. T. Tseng (University of Texas Medical Branch) and maintained in DMEM (Gibco), 20% fetal bovine serum (HyClone), and 1 Gibco antibiotic-antimycotic solution. human airway epithelium cultures were generated by provision of an air-liquid interface (ALI) for 6 to 8 weeks to form well-differentiated, polarized cultures DBT cells were infected with the indicated virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.01 PFU per cell for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cell supernatants were harvested 24 h postinfection. EC50 values and curves were generated with the nonlinear regression curve fit in GraphPad Prism software. fully mature HAE cultures were obtained from the UNC Tissue Core. at 48 h prior to infection, 500 l of PBS was added to apical surface of the cultures. cultures were moved to ALI medium containing GS-5734 concentrations. cultures were harvested at 48 h post-drug treatment, which was 72 h postinfection. supernatant was harvested 12 h postinfection, and the viral titer was determined by plaque assay. in triplicate in increasing concentrations of GS-441524, ranging from 1 to 12 M. supernatant was harvested and frozen when the cell monolayer demonstrated 80% cytopathic effect (CPE) or after 24 h. a constant volume of 16 l was used to initiate subsequent passages. a 1,450-bp cassette encoding resistance substitutions was synthesized by bioBasic, Inc. the cassette was then cloned into the SARS-CoV D infectious cDNA plasmid. the subsequent selected clone was verified across the cassette. supernatants and cell monolayers in TRIzol were collected from each passage. RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed using SuperScript III. results represent the combined frequency of F476L and V553L mutations."}
