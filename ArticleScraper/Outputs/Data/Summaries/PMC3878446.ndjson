{"summary": "the ongoing human outbreak of avian H7N9 in china highlights the need for increased surveillance and control in these live-bird markets. discussion Closure of retail markets rapidly decreased human cases to rare, sporadic occurrence. but little attention has been paid thus far to the role of upstream elements of the poultry distribution chain such as wholesale markets. rLBMs can be isolated at high rates from other holdings that form the supply chain for rLBMs. incubation periods for AIVs in poultry can be up to 2 days when birds are inoculated with doses less than or equal to 103. if the average stay-time of birds in rLBMs is 2 days, there is not time for exponential growth of prevalence. direct transmission in rLBMs should be limited by interplay of stay-times and incubation periods. retail LBMs are also thought to foster persistence of AIVs in the environment. the importance of an environmental factor in viral persistence has been shown in an experiment that monitored AIV isolation rates before and after days that the market was disinfected. time is increased from 1\u20132 days (Figure 1A) it slows for stay-times greater than 3 days. bans on overnight poultry storage in live-bird markets in Hong Kong have been so effective at eliminating AIVs. quail and other minor poultry may remain longer due to lower demand. difference between mean prevalence of the \u2018reference\u2019 scenario (no disinfection routine) and mean prevalence under each treatment, divided by the reference and expressed as a percent. Efficacy of disinfection (i.e. 100, 90 and 50%) is indicated in the legend with a stay-time of 3 days. the model results are calibrated with surveillance data for H9 subtypes in a major wLBM and nine rLBMs in Shantou, china. average prevalence in rLBM is roughly twice as high as prevalence in wLBM. one monthly sample from the wholesale market was unusually high at 44%. the plot is truncated between 22 and 44%. prevalence in wholesale markets may be as much as 50% that in retail markets. 2 strain [2] validates predictions from surveillance data and emphasizes the need to understand the multi-host epidemiology of H9N2 viruses. it may be appropriate to list these strains under the OIE definition for high-risk strains so that more extreme measures can be used to control their re-introduction. direct transmission in rLBMs should be limited by interplay of stay-times and incubation periods. retail LBMs are also thought to foster persistence of AIVs in the environment. the importance of an environmental factor in viral persistence has been shown in an experiment that monitored AIV isolation rates before and after days that the market was disinfected. rise in prevalence highlights why bans on overnight poultry storage in live-bird markets in Hong Kong have been so effective at eliminating AIVs. longer stay-times for quail could partly explain why they have been implicated as intermediate hosts in the emergence of novel strains. difference between mean prevalence of the \u2018reference\u2019 scenario (no disinfection routine) and mean prevalence under each treatment, divided by the reference.

Medians for each set of parameters are indicated as small circles. PCC indicates partial correlation coefficients for mean daily prevalence and the value of a particular parameter."}
