{"summary": "the catalyst (C1) sequence was designed as a selected 29-mer fragment within ORF1A region of MERS-CoV virus gene (MRES-1A, Fig. 2A)31,33. the reaction followed a classic four-step pathway9 shown in Fig. 1A. the calculation was made on open-access online software, NuPack34. the buffer condition was set to contain 200 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2. HT-CHA responses at 55 \u00b0C with and without C1 represent formamide. HT-CHA could lose some catalytic efficiency at cooler temperature due to slower dissociation of C1 from H1-H2-C1 complex. this loss was more attributed to the undesirable secondary structures in C1 and fragment 4*-3*-2*-5*-6* formed at around 20 \u00b0C. formamide could decrease duplex melting temperature at a rate of 6.5 \u00b0C/volume fraction (100) formamide. meanwhile, formamide is likely to just soften but not destroy a base pair through forming a base-formamide-base intermediate. formamide-enhanced structure-buffering and thermo-buffering abilities could be generalized to any one step strand exchange reaction and CHA circuit. the effect of formimade on an ideal (no self-folding) strand exchange or CHA reaction would not be definitely positive at desired functional temperatures or above. F5 was quenched by the Quencher on Q5. the experiments were carried out at 25 \u00b0C. the highest necessity of using formamide sits. the more the temperature was lower than 47 \u00b0C, the more formamide was required to achieve satisfied promotion. but at any situation formamide should be controlled less than 50%. otherwise over amounted formamide would seriously destabilize expected H1, H2 and reporter duplexes. the new OHT-CHA (OHT-CHA2) again showed a significant performance surge at room temperature of 17 \u00b0C (Fig. 5A, 55 \u00b0C shown in Figure S12) using one other target (C3 here) to open a hairpin transducer, the unlocked C1 could then trigger the OHT-CHA1 efficiently at 25 \u00b0C. this success further generalized OHT-CHA to those sequences non-relevant to its components. accumulated Loop 3 (C1) would initial OHT-CHA1 (without formamide) at 55 \u00b0C. addition of formamide allowed same OHT-CHA1 executing end-point detection on fluorescence (FL) facilities with no temperature control. primers in reactions with different amount templates have been consumed in a short given time. similar to other powerful isothermal amplifications, LAMP with different samples might randomly produce unrepeatable side amplicons. this could affect the accurate quantification of correct amplicons. OHT-CHA to detect LAMP amplicons of Zaire Ebolavirus synthetic DNA templates (ZEBOV)33. products from both PI and PII could generate OHT-CHA fluorescence curves. gel pictures and kinetic curves in Fig. 8 could show different patterns and slopes whenever the experiments are repeated. the catalyst (C1) sequence was designed as a selected 29-mer fragment within ORF1A region of MERS-CoV virus gene (MRES-1A, Fig. 2A)31,33. each of the numbered domains contains 10\u201315 mer short sequence. HT-CHA at 55 \u00b0C with and without C1 represents formamide. C1mis1 and C1mis2 represent mismatched C1 with T-to-A and G-to-C single point mutation. HT-CHA could lose catalytic efficiency at cooler temperature due to slower dissociation of C1 from H1-H2-C1 complex. this was more attributed to the undesirable secondary structures in C1 and fragment 4*-3*-2*-5*-6* formed at around 20 \u00b0C. this assumption could be confirmed by observing gradually recovered catalytic activities along with heating-up the reaction. formamide is likely to just soften but not destroy a base pair through forming a base-formamide-base intermediate. a detection limit of 50 pM C1 was gotten at 25 \u00b0C (Figure S4), as sensitive as that gotten from a suppressed HT-CHA functioning at its desirable high temperature15. the effect of formimade on an ideal (no self-folding) strand exchange or CHA reaction would not be definitely positive at desired functional temperatures or above. the advantage of using formamide in a circuit would be especially dramatic, much more obvious compared with in a one-step strand exchange reaction. duplex solution without (B) and with (C) 25% formamide. the three catalysts hold the same Clinear sequence that can trigger the CHA reaction at 37 \u00b0C. the segment in red was the toehold binding domain, partly blocked in Cstructured1 and Cstructured2 at different degrees. formamide provided the highest signal-to-background ratio for OHT-CHA1. under equal amount formamide provided the highest signal-to-background ratio. amide could also increase detection selectivity of a circuit at low temperature. the pathway for this strategy was shown in Fig. 5C. this success further generalized OHT-CHA to those sequences non-relevant to its components. the pathway for this strategy was shown in Fig. 5C. accumulated Loop 3 (C1) would initial OHT-CHA1 (without formamide) at 55 \u00b0C. addition of formamide also allowed the same OHT-CHA1 executing end-point detection on fluorescence (FL) facilities with no temperature control. LAMP with different samples might randomly produce unrepeatable side amplicons. this could affect the accurate quantification of correct amplicons. products from both PI and PII could generate OHT-CHA fluorescence curves. both samples contained correct amplicons and were ZEBOV positive. the gel pictures and kinetic curves could show different patterns and slopes. formamide was not encouraged being added into the real-time detection at as high as 60 \u00b0C. it may do harm to the DNA polymerase and delay the LAMP reaction. formamide could also inhibit enzymes in serum that could degrade CHA components. the introduction of formamide to smooth undesired structures in strand exchange and CHA reactions was suggested for the first time. the as-named OHT-CHA may boost the usage of nucleic circuitry in detecting diseases at somewhere there is poor temperature control. a reaction mixture contained 50 nM H1 (or H3, or H5), 200 nM H2 (or H4, or H6) and 50 nM Reporter duplex. each CHA mixture was recorded every 1 to 3 min at different temperatures. concentrations of CHA components, operating temperatures, inputs, amide concentrations, and instruments were also listed in Table S2 for convenient reading. transcription templates cloned in a pCR2.1-TOPO vector were amplified by PCR using Phusion DNA polymerase. final PCR products (MERS-1A and ZEBOV) were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis and then purified using the Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-up system. electrophoresis was performed in a fume-cupboard completely separate from the normal laboratory space. standard real-time and end-point LAMP-HT-CHA and LAMP-OHT-CHA detection End-point A total 17 L liquid containing certain volume of formamide, certain volume of 10Iso buffer, certain volume of 100 mM MgCl2 and 3 L concentrated CHA component mixture were added into every 25 L standard LAMP products. Fluorescence reading on deNovix DS-11 + FX spectrophotometer and HG-2 Portable Fluorescent Detector used a 42 L final reaction mixture instead of 17 L. kinetic data points for each sample were manually collected separately. each CHA mixture was recorded every 1 to 3 min at different temperatures. concentrations of CHA components, operating temperatures, inputs, amide concentrations, and instruments used for each Figure of this paper were also listed in Table S2 for convenient reading. final PCR products were verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. then purified using the Wizard SV gel and PCR Clean-up system. Synthetic M. tuberculosis rpoB gene segment was generated from commercial genomic DNA of the virulent strain H37Rv. standard real-time and end-point LAMP-HT-CHA and LAMP-OHT-CHA detection End-point A total 17 L liquid containing certain volume of formamide, certain volume of 10Iso buffer, certain volume of 100 mM MgCl2 and 3 L concentrated CHA component mixture were added into every 25 L standard LAMP products. deNovix DS-11 + FX spectrophotometer and HG-2 Portable Fluorescent Detector used a 42 L final reaction mixture instead of 17 L. kinetic data points for each sample were manually collected separately. nM H2, 200 nM Reporter duplex and 200 nM Reporter duplex were used instead. fluorescence signal of 17 L each final reaction mixture was recorded every 1 to 3 min on a lightCycler\u00ae 96 real-time PCR system.
