{"summary": "a well-studied example is the ability of positive-sense single-stranded RNA viruses (+RNA) to induce cellular membrane rearrangements upon expression of viral proteins. this reorganization of cellular membranes is a critical step in the viral replication cycle. viruses generally cause proliferation of membranes, forming structures. avirus (MERS-CoV), mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are found in cells infected with the Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses. the virus induces little CM and instead induces membrane zippering to form zippered endoplasmic reticulum. nsp4 of MHV has been shown to be important for the normal function and stability of DMVs. mutations in nsp4 resulted in attenuated virus and impairment of DMV formation. expression of two nsps (nsps2 and 3) was able to produce DMVs [32,33,34] several strains of IBV cause disease that varies in severity from mild respiratory problems to virulent strains that can cause nephropathology and reproductive organ pathology. in this study, we compared the membrane rearrangements induced by viral proteins from two different strains of IBV, the pathogenic M41 and the apathogenic BeauR. however, M41 produces a low spherule phenotype when compared with other strains of the virus. RNA was extracted from virus-infected cells using an RNAeasy kit. PCR was carried out on cDNA using primers specific for each gene. pcDNA3.1(-) was modified by insertion of a 3xFLAG motif between the KpnI and HindIII sites to generate pcDNA3.1(-)-3xFLAG. cell lysates were heated with 4 sample buffer (Bio-rad Laboratories, Watford, UK) membranes were washed with PBS-T and incubated with IRDye conjugated secondary antibodies (LI-COR, Cambridge, UK) membranes were incubated with primary antibodies to detect GFP (Biolegend, London, UK), mCherry (Abcam, Cambridge, UK), or FLAG. cells were transfected with a total of 500 ng plasmid with a DNA:lipofectamine 2000 ratio of 1:2. after 24 h, cells were fixed for 20 min in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS. cells were then permeabilized in 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 10 min. cells were washed once in 0.9% saline and scraped into saline buffer. DF1 cells were then rinsed three times in 0.1 M sodium cacodylate. cells were embedded in 2% uranium acetate aqueous for 2 h at 4 \u00b0C. data was recorded on a FEI Tecnai 12 TEM (FEI, Cambridge, UK) used at 100 kV with a TVIPS F214 digital camera. sections of 80 nm were cut, collected on hexagonal 200 thin bar copper grids, and stained with 2% uranyl acetate and lead citrate. tagged nsps derived from either the apathogenic strain BeauR or the pathogenic strain M41 were generated to produce pEGFP-N1-M41 nsp3, pmCherry-N1-BeauR nsp4, pmCherry-N1-M41 nsp4, pcDNA3.1(-)-BeauR nsp6-3xFLAG, and pcDNA3.1(-)-M41 nsp cells were transfected with a total of 1000 ng plasmid using lipofectamine 2000. cells were lysed in cell lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% v/v Triton-X100, 5% v/v glycerol, 1 HALT protease inhibitor complex) after 24 h, membranes were washed DF1 cells seeded onto glass coverslips were transfected with pEGFP-N1-M41 nsp3, pmCherry-N1-BeauR nsp4, pcDNA3.1(-)-BeauR nsp6-3xFLAG, and pcDNA3.1(-)-M41 nsp6-3xFLAG alone or in combination using lipofectamine 2000. after 24 h, cells were fixed for 20 min in fresh 1 BES medium (MEM, 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth, 0.2% bovine serum albumin, 20 mM N,N-Bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-2-aminoethanesulfonic acid (BES), 0.21% sodium bicarbonate, 2 mM l-glutamine, 250 U/mL nystatin, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 U/mL streptomycin) cells were ected with BeauR and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. cells were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 1 h, incubated in 1% aqueous osmium tetroxide solution for 1 h, then dehydrated in increasing concentrations of ethanol. cells were embedded into Agar 100 resin and sections of 80 nm were cut, collected on hexagonal 200 thin bar copper grids. IBV induces Typical Membrane rearrangements in DF1 cells. membrane rearrangements include DMVs, zER, and spherules. DF1 cells were infected with bronchitis virus (IBV) BeauR. nsps4 and 6 from apathogenic BeauR and nsps3, 4, and 6 from pathogenic M41 were tagged with fluorescent or epitope tags. it was not possible to generate a plasmid expressing nsp3 from BeauR due to presumed toxic sequences, as has been found in other coronaviruses. nsp4 was found in small and large puncta in cells where the level of nsp4 expression was higher. DF1 cells were transfected with either the plasmid expressing nsp3-GFP alone or plasmids expressing nsp4 or 6 together with pYFP-ER. after 24 h, cells were fixed and labelled with anti-FLAG- and nsp3-expressing cells with anti-protein disulphide DF1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing nsp4-mCherry and nsp6-3xFLAG from BeauR, and nsp3-EGFP, nsp4-mCherry, and nsp6-3xFLAG from M41 together with YFP-ER. after 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged. co-expression of nsps3, 4, and 6 resulted in relocalization of all three proteins to cytoplasmic puncta. nsps4 and 6 derived from either BeauR or M41 exhibited the same pattern of localization. this demonstrates that co-expression of IBV nsps in the absence of any other viral components can result in their relocalization within the cell. DF1 cells were transfected with tagged nsp3, 4, and 6 derived from BeauR or M41 alone and in combination. after 24 h, cells were chemically fixed, embedded in resin, and visualized using an electron microscope. phenotype common to all transfected cells was small, tight whorl-like structures which stained more strongly than other structures. expression of IBV nsp4 induces pairing of cellular membranes with no additional role for nsp3. the effect of co-expression of nsp3 with nsp4 on cellular membranes was investigated. expression of nsp3 with nsp4 had no effect on membrane pairing ability of nsp4. membrane rearrangements appeared comparable to cells expressing nsp4 alone, i.e., paired membranes connected to the ER and lacking ribosomes. this data confirms that IBV nsp4 alone is the main driving factor in membrane pairing. DF1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing nsp6-3xFLAG from BeauR. cells expressing nsp6 formed disordered membranes while those expressing M41 nsp6 did not. co-expression of nsp6 with either nsp3 or 4 disrupts this mechanism. all three nsps was the paired membranes induced by expression of nsp4 alone. in cells co-expressing nsp3, 4, and 6 derived from M41, no DMV-like vesicles were found in 489 cell sections. nsp6 is unlikely to be the additional nsp required for IBV formation. DF1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either BeauR nsp4 or BeauR nsp4 with M41 nsp3. after 24 h, cells were fixed and processed for ET. paired membranes produced by nsp4 expression were found to form sheet-like structures with sections of paired membranes dilating in several places. in vero cells, primary chicken kidney cells (CKCs) and tracheal organ cultures (TOCs) these membrane rearrangements include DMVs, zER, and spherules. DF1 cells were infected with bronchitis virus (IBV) BeauR. nsps4 and 6 from apathogenic BeauR and nsps3, 4, and 6 from pathogenic M41 were tagged with fluorescent or epitope tags. it was not possible to generate a plasmid expressing nsp3 from BeauR due to presumed toxic sequences. DF1 cells were transfected and after 24 h cells were lysed and proteins separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Western blot. DF1 cells were transfected with either the plasmid expressing nsp3-GFP alone or plasmids expressing nsp4 or 6 together with pYFP-ER. cells were fixed and labelled with anti-FLAG- and nsp3-expressing cells with anti-protein disulphide isomerase (PDI), a resident ER protein. colocalization between YFP-ER or PDI was observed. DF1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing nsp4-mCherry and nsp6-3xFLAG from BeauR, and nsp3-EGFP, nsp4-mCherry, and nsp6-3xFLAG from M41 together with YFP-ER. after 24 h, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and imaged. nsps4 and 6 derived from either BeauR or M41 exhibited the same pattern of localization. co-expression of IBV nsps results in their relocalization from the ER to cytoplasmic foci. DF1 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing nsp4-mCherry and nsp6-3xFLAG from BeauR. DF1 cells were transfected with tagged nsp3, 4 and 6 derived from BeauR or M41 alone and in combination. after 24 h, cells were chemically fixed, embedded in resin, and visualized using an electron microscope. phenotype common to all transfected cells was small, tight whorl-like structures which stained more strongly than other structures. 31 out of 235 cell sections contained piled membranes. expression of nsp4 induces pairing of cellular membranes with no additional role for nsp3. DF1 cells were transfected with empty vectors: GFP, mCherry, and 3xFLAG. membrane rearrangements appeared comparable to cells expressing nsp4 alone. paired membranes connected to the ER were found covering large and smaller areas of the cytoplasm. nsp6 induces the formation of disordered Membranes Coronavirus nsp6. disordered membranes were only found in cells co-expressing BeauR nsp6 but none when co-expressing M41 nsp6. expression of nsp6 alone induces the formation of piled, disordered membranes. no DMV-like vesicles were found in 489 cell sections. only nsp4-associated paired membranes were detected. co-expression of IBV nsps 3, 4 and 6 may be sufficient for formation of DMVs. paired membranes produced by nsp4 expression were found to form sheet-like structures with sections of paired membranes dilating in several places (arrowheads) expression of nsp4 alone results in the formation of paired ER membranes with no additional role for nsp3. the formation of membrane rearrangements is a well-conserved mechanism used by these viruses in order to provide a site for viral RNA synthesis. some light has been shed in recent years on the specific viral proteins involved in the formation of these structures. nsp3 and 4 were co-expressed, nsp3 and 4 were co-expressed. nsp3 and 4 were colocalized as seen before but some puncta contained nsp6 alone. expression of nsp3 from either SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV results in the production of disordered membrane bodies likely derived from the ER. nsp3 from MHV A59 shows only 13.4% homology and 25.9% similarity. differences in the mechanism of their formation might reasonably be expected. expression of nsp6 alone did not appear to induce microtubule organizing center vesiculation as seen upon expression of nsp6. nsp4-induced paired membranes were observed as both small regions throughout the cytoplasm and also in extensive areas of paired membranes. this reflects the lack of other viral proteins making up the replication complex. this is the first time for any coronavirus that, regardless of mechanism, a membrane pairing function for nsp4 alone has been described. the reason for this difference is not clear. we used separate plasmids to express nsp3 and 4 but this strategy was also used in previous work. the protein expression strategy is unlikely to be the reason that DMVs were not formed. nsp6 does not appear to be the IBV protein required to induce DMVs and other viral proteins must play a role. we were unable to clone nsp3 from BeauR due to toxicity problems in Escherichia coli. cloning the C-terminal part of nsp3 from BeauR may provide further insight into the role of nsp3 in membrane modifications. the precise molar ratio of nsps to one another, as well as the presence of cleavage intermediates, is critical for spherule formation. spherule formation by IBV may require expression of additional nsps, including those required for RNA synthesis. the mechanisms behind the formation of virus-induced membrane rearrangements required for replication organelle formation are doubtlessly complex. the identity of the IBV proteins required for both spherule and DMV formation remain unknown."}
