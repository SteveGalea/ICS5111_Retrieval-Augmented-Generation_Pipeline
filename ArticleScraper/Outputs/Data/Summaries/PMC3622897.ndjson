{"summary": "closteroviruses explore the upper size limit for the RNA-based genomes. the relatively large genetic capacity of these viruses likely requires higher fidelity of RNA replication than is typical for RNA viruses. closteroviral vectors are available and show strong potential for application in functional genomics and pathogen control. closterovirus vectors fill very important niches that are inaccessible to most other plant virus vectors. closterovirus vectors fill very important niches that are inaccessible to most other plant virus vectors. these niches include fruit-producing specialty crops such as citrus and grapevine. closteroviridae includes three approved (Closterovirus, Crinivirus, and Ampelovirus; Karasev, 2000) and one proposed (Velarivirus; Al Rwahnih et al., 2012) genera. despite the large, up to 19.3 kb size of their genomes, closteroviruses are rank-and-file members of the Alphavirus-like superfamily. a large central portion of this polyprotein is less conserved, but is functionally important because several alanine-scanning mutations introduced into this region decreased or abolished RNA amplification. it seems plausible that this region contributes to the relatively high fidelity of RNA replication required for the reproduction of RNA viruses with the largest genomes. extensive database searches failed to identify significant sequence similarity between the central parts of closterovirus polyproteins and any other proteins. proteolytic gene expression cassette with -glucuronidase ORF fused in frame to papain-like, self-cleaving domain of potivirus HC-Pro. dual expression cassette including native BYV promoter, green fluorescent protein ORF (GFP) and heterologous BYSV promoter. p21 is a strong suppressor of RNAi that non-specifically binds and sequesters double-stranded form of the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and micro RNAs (miRNAs; Reed et al., 2003; Chapman et al., 2004). p21 is a strong suppressor of RNAi that non-specifically binds and sequesters double-stranded form of the small interfer sgRNA synthesis in BYV is regulated both quantitatively and temporally by several early and late promoters. the promoter controlling production of the major capsid protein (CP) directs gene expression early in the replication cycle and to the highest level. the flexuous filamentous virions of closteroviruses are the longest currently known, reaching the length of 2,000 nm. the overall morphology of the virions is similar to that of the other filamentous viruses in the families -, -, and -Flexiviridae (Martelli et al., 2007), and Potyviridae (Adams et al., 2012), all of which encode homologous CP virions of closteroviruses contain at least two more structural proteins. the third one is a 60-kDa protein (p64 in BYV) whose C-terminal domain is yet another divergent duplicate of the CP. analysis of the BYV tail morphology and composition indicated that p20 most likely forms the pointed tip segment of the three-segment tail. the closteroviruses possess a conserved dedicated movement protein of 6-kDa (p6 in BYV) that is targeted to ER via its N-terminal transmembrane domain. tails guide viral genomes to and through plasmodesmata to allow directional transport. virion tip component p20 is required for long-distance transport of BYV through the phloem. it is not clear if these viruses also encode the analogous long-distance transport factors. the pace of systemic infection for closteroviruses that infect woody plants is even slower, reaching 1 month or longer. the genome organization and molecular biology of closteroviruses are of paramount importance for the vector design. replacement of any gene will result in a loss of replication or systemic infectivity. the larger CTV genome contains genes that are required for infection of some citrus species but not others. the mechanisms whereby Alphavirus-like viruses including closteroviruses express their proteins involve proteases and expression of sgRNAs. closteroviruses encode RNAi suppressors that are among the strongest characterized so far. closteroviruses encode RNAi suppressors that are among the strongest characterized so far. closteroviruses encode RNAi suppressors that are among the strongest characterized so far. a more advanced vector capable of expressing recombinant protein has become a prototype for the subsequent designs of vectors based on other closteroviruses. in this vector, the recombinant ORF encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) was inserted downstream from the native CP sgRNA promoter, whereas a heterologous CP promoter derived from a closely related Beet yellow stunt virus was used to express the BYV CP. the resulting agroinoculation procedure remains the method of choice for introducing RNA viral vectors back to plants. in general, transient expression of recombinant genes via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is highly efficient because the leaf infiltration procedure delivers large numbers of gene transfer-competent bacteria per each plant cell. agroinfiltration is used to deliver the viral vector, only very few cells become infected. gRNA promoter was inserted upstream from BYSV promoter to allow simultaneous production of the monomeric red fluorescent protein (mRFP) targeted to nucleus and the ER-targeted GFP. alternative vector design included a proteolytic expression cassette introduced downstream from L-Pro. this cassette encompassed a fusion of GUS to the proteolytic domain of the potyvirus helper component-protease. cyclic virion transfer in protoplasts initially transfected with RNA transcripts was developed. this procedure was also adapted for slash-inoculation of citrus trees. a short variant of the BYV CP sgRNA promoter was used to drive GFP expression. the ability to propagate CTV-derived gene expression vectors in a herbaceous host matches that in citrus. it will be interesting to determine if genetic stability of the CTV vectors in a herbaceous host matches that in citrus. this potential might be jeopardized by the concerns due to the concerns due to the CTV transmission by its natural insect vectors, aphids. a cDNA clone was obtained using N. benthamiana-propagated GLRaV-2. this clone was readily launched to this host plant via agroinoculation. this clone exhibited primarily phloem-limited systemic distribution as one would expect. inoculation of grapevine roots, young seedlings, or micropropagated plantlets. propagation of vLR2-GFP in N. benthamiana could result in loss of infectivity in grapevine. cDNA fragments derived from a consensus sequence of an isolate were used. vLR2-GFP is genetically stable: only some of the infected plants exhibited deterioration of the insert after 1 year-long propagation in grapevine. the most unexpected and important ability of vLR2 was to elicit powerful systemic VIGS despite the fact that GLRaV-2 encode a strong RNAi suppressor. two endogenous grapevine genes involved in chlorophyll metabolism as VIGS targets. these genes were phytoene desaturase (PDS) and subunit I of magnesium-protoporphyrin IX chelatase (ChlI); nucleotide sequences derived from each of the corresponding ORFs were inserted into vLR2-GFP in the positive or negative orientations. each of these vector variants was inoculated to grapevine and each closterovirus vectors provide unique tools for citrus and grapevine biotechnology. the VIGS capability of vLR2 is an excellent example of the power of closterovirus vectors. this vector is immediately applicable to the functional genomics of grapevine. vLR2-based VIGS vectors target mildew-causing fungi, phylloxera, mealybugs, and glassy-winged sharpshooters. vLR2-based VIGS vectors transmit viruses causing leafroll disease and bacterium Xylella fastidiosa causing Pierce's disease. elucidation of the molecular mechanisms behind this high replication fidelity remains an interesting challenge for further work on closteroviruses. elucidation of the molecular mechanisms behind this high replication fidelity remains an interesting challenge for further work on closteroviruses."}
