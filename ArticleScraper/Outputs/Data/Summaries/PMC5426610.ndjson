{"summary": "the annual influenza epidemics claim up to 500,000 lives, with children, the elderly and patients with compromised immune system being mainly affected. Currently available vaccines protect only against seasonal influenza and need to be reformulated annually while antivirals are the only defense against pandemic FLUAV. 17 TTSPs were identified in humans and several of them, including TMPRSS4 and HAT, were shown to be expressed in lung and to activate HA upon directed expression in cell culture [20\u201327]. a recent study showed that H3N2 viruses might be able to exploit TMPRSS4 jointly with TMPRSS2 for spread in the host. the macaque model has been successfully used for vaccine-, treatment- and pathogenesis-studies. TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT of NHP origin can cleave and activate FLUAV HA of the H1 subtype. spread of FLUAV (H1N1 subtype) in human, macaque and marmoset lung tissue can be blocked by a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2. amburg/04/2009 (H1N1) were propagated in the chorioallantoic cavities of 10-days-old embryonated hen eggs for 48 h at 37\u00b0C. the focus formation assay was performed exactly as previously described [22,36].

Diaminobenzidin (Ventana/View DAB, Detection Kit, Roche) was applied as chromagen according to the supplier s instructions. slides were counterstained with hematoxylin and bluing reagent before examination by light microscopy. all animal work was conducted according to relevant national and international guidelines. animals were euthanized by an authorized veterinarian for animal welfare reasons. animals were deeply anaesthetized using a combination of ketamine and xylazine. h after inoculation with virus, eggs were euthanized by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. the eggs were euthanized by an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C. experiments conducted before the last third of the development of the animal begin. the NHP encoded TMPRSS2 orthologues shared 86.0 (common marmoset), 87.8 (rhesus) or 88.0% (cynomolgus) sequence identity with human TMPRSS2 on the amino acid level. rhesus and cynomolgus HAT both shared 92.3% amino acid sequence identity with the human protein. the NHP orthologues of TMPRSS4 were to 95.9% expression of TMPRSS2 proteins was more robust than expression of TMPRSS4 and HAT proteins. TTSPs are synthesized as inactivate precursors, zymogens. expression of human TMPRSS2 and its NHP orthologues was somewhat reduced compared to its macaque orthologues. TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT of non-human primate origin cleave and activate influenza virus hemagglutinin. treatment of HA expressing cells with trypsin resulted in the cleavage of the HA precursor, HA0. the indicated proteases were expressed in 293T cells and the cells infected with FLUAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) at an MOI 0.01 and treated with either trypsin or PBS. the average of three to five independent experiments is shown; error bars indicate standard error of the mean. n color was robustly expressed in bronchiolar epithelial cells and subepithelial alveolar macrophages. Camostat is a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 [40]. it was given the opportunity to investigate whether FLUAV spread in human and non-human primate PCLS depends on serine protease activity. human, rhesus macaque, cynomolgus macaque or common marmoset lung were infected with 3 x 104 ffu of FLUAV A/Hamburg/04/2009 (H1N1, human PCLS) at 48 h post infection, the viral titers in the supernatants were tested using focus formation assay. similar results were obtained in three to five independent experiments. rhesus and cynomolgus HAT both shared 92.3% amino acid sequence identity with the human protein. TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT are conserved between humans and non-human primates. protein alignment was performed by using Vector NTI AlignX. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids encoding TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 or HAT. expression of -actin was determined as a loading control. expression of TMPRSS2 proteins was more robust than expression of TMPRSS4 and HAT proteins. TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT of non-human primate origin cleave and activate influenza virus hemagglutinin. TMPRSS2, TMPRSS4 and HAT of non-human primate origin cleave and activate the influenza virus hemagglutinin. the indicated proteases were expressed in 293T cells and the cells infected with FLUAV A/PR/8/34 (H1N1) at an MOI 0.01 and treated with either trypsin or PBS. at 48 h post infection, the virus titers were determined by focus formation assay. TMPRSS2 is expressed in macaque respiratory epithelium and serine protease activity is required for influenza A virus spread in respiratory epithelium of human and non-human primate origin. TMPRSS2 was robustly expressed in bronchiolar epithelial cells and subepithelial alveolar macrophages. camostat is a serine protease inhibitor active against TMPRSS2 [40] SS2 in precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) of rhesus macaque origin was analyzed using immunohistochemistry with an antibody raised against human TMPRSS2. the antibody cross-reacts with the rhesus macaque orthologue. macaques and marmoset orthologues of TMPRSS2 cleave and activate HA. TMPRSS2 is expressed in rhesus macaque respiratory epithelium. macaques may be suitable to model TMPRSS2 usage by FLUAV in humans. TMPRSS2 is coexpressed with 2,6-linked sialic acid, the major receptor determinant of human FLUAV. expression was detected in human bronchiolar epithelium [13] and the present study indicates substantial levels of TMPRSS2 are also produced in bronchiolar epithelial cells of rhesus macaques. however, potential differences in the cell type specificity of TMPRSS2 expression can at present not be excluded. AV spread in PCLS of human, macaque and marmoset origin without inducing cytotoxic effects. camostat inhibits FLUAV replication and cytokine production in cultures of human and NHP tracheal epithelial cells."}
