{"summary": "inTRODUCTION japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is a mosquito-transmitted, enveloped virus belonging to the genus Flavivirus within the family Flaviviridae. it also includes dengue virus (DENV), west Nile virus (WNV), yellow fever virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus (26) it is an important human-pathogenic virus, causing approximately 50,000 acute encephalitis cases annually in humans. flavivirus endocytosis has been done with WNV and DENV. the functional entry of WNV is cholesterol dependent (43), whereas in C6/36 cells, it uses clathrin-mediated endocytosis (12). this entry route differs from the clathrin-mediated pathway for DENV-2 to infect A549 cells. contrasting results have been reported about the role of membrane cholesterol in JEV entry in mouse neuroblastoma cells and BHK-21 cells (34). the aim of this study was to elucidate the internalization mechanism of JEV in B104 rat neuroblastoma cells. cells were washed with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 45 min at 4\u00b0C. proteinase K was inactivated with 2 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) in PBS with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cells were washed with PBS\u20130.2% BSA by low-speed centrifugation.
