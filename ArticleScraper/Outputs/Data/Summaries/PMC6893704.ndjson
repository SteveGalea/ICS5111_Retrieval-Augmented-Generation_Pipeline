{"summary": "the feline coronavirus (FCoV) occurs in two distinct pathotypes that can be distinguished by their biological behavior, but not by their morphology. the feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) is highly prevalent in multi-cat environments. infection is mostly asymptomatic or only causes mild and transient diarrhea. ante mortem diagnosis of FIP is especially difficult in cats without significant effusion. specificity is always the most important diagnostic value to consider. hyperglobulinemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia and potentially, depending on organ involvement. hyperglobulinemia in cats with FIP can occur either alone or in combination with hypoalbuminemia or hyperproteinemia. gamma-globulin concentrations can be either polyclonal (more common) or monoclonal as differentiated by serum protein electrophoresis. increased concentrations of APP can also be found in cats with various other inflammatory conditions, neoplasia or even in healthy FECV-infected cats [25,26,27,29,30,31,32]. APP can only be helpful when interpreted together with other abnormalities in order to provide an index of suspicion of FIP in an individual cat [28]. the Rivalta\u2019s test is a cheap and quick test that can easily be performed on effusions in clinical practice. it has good sensitivity for excluding FIP (91\u2013100%), meaning that whenever it is negative, other potential causes for effusion are much more likely than FIP. CSF cytology often reveals a mixed or suppurative inflammation. mononuclear infiltration can be seen as well. unremarkable cytology can also occur in cats with other neurologic diseases. lymphopenia, observed in about 50% of cats with FIP, is reported only rarely in cats without effusion. hyperglobulinemia, hyperglobulinemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperbilirubinemia, azotemia and potentially, depending on organ involvement, can be present. the most common abnormality reported is hyperglobulinemia. if a cat presents with any of the aforementioned clinicopathologic abnormalities in routine practice, these always have to be interpreted in conjunction with other clinical, laboratory or imaging findings. they might only support a suspicion of FIP if other abnormalities consistent with FIP are present as well and FIP should never be diagnosed solely on the basis of hematological or biochemical parameters. the Rivalta\u2019s test is a cheap and quick test that can easily be performed on effusions in clinical practice. it has good sensitivity for excluding FIP (91\u2013100%), meaning that whenever it is negative, other potential causes for effusion are much more likely than FIP. the ratio between both channels, the TNC, is higher in cats with FIP than in healthy cats. higher cut-offs of 2.5 or 3.4 even increased specificity to 100%. cytology often reveals a mixed or suppurative inflammation. aqueocentesis can provide aqueous humor for cytological and clinicopathological testing. however, cytology is often non-diagnostic or more useful to diagnose lymphoma. detecting anti-FCoV antibodies leads to the production of specific antibodies, independently of the development of FIP [53,54,55]. antibodies can be detected in the serum of cats that were vaccinated against FCoV. a large proportion of the cat population (up to 80% and more, especially in multi-cat households) has serum antibodies against FCoV. but most of these cats never develop FIP [54,60,70,70,71,72,73,74] a large number of antibodies is most likely bound by the high virus load in end-stage FIP [81,82,83], and thus, cats with FIP without effusions can have negative serum anti-FCoV antibody titers. the results of studies evaluating the performance of antibody tests for diagnosing FIP are summarized in Table 1. IFAT 30\u201379% 64\u201398% Histopathology Diseases other than FIP [87] FIP (n = 97) IFAT 85% 57% Histopathology Diseases other than FIP [87] FIP (n = 88) IFAT 100% n. d.

Approximately 10% of cats with FIP do not have serum antibodies. studies evaluating sensitivity and specificity of the detection of serum antibodies in comparison to either histopathology, a combination of diagnostic tests or clinical suspicion of feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) control groups consisted of healthy cats or cats with diseases other than FIP (with or without clinical signs consistent with FIP) antibody detection can be performed to screen cats that are about to be newly integrated into a group. cats without detectable antibodies most likely do not shed FCoV with their feces. but fecal shedding has been observed in experimentally infected cats. Detection of anti-FCoV antibodies had a sensitivity of 84%. the fact that 18 cats without detectable antibodies were positive for FCoV RNA in their effusion demonstrated that anti-FCoV antibody detection alone has only limited diagnostic value. antibody detection in effusion is not more useful for diagnosis of FIP than antibody detection in serum. control groups consisted of only cats with any kind of neurologic disease [45] or of a combination of cats with neurologic and non-neurologic disorders. a recent study included cats with neurological signs suggested to be caused by FIP, although the diagnosis was not confirmed by histopathology.

IHC can only be performed post mortem because ante mortem tissue sample collection via laparotomy or laparoscopy is an invasive procedure that bears several risks. many different organs have to be sampled due to the fact that FCoV antigen is variably distributed within the FIP-induced tissue lesions. a false positive immunocytochemical result was found in a mesenteric lymph node sample, resulting in a specificity of only 91%. a possible explanation could be inadequate material obtained for analysis due to cellular damage. a possible explanation for this could be inadequate material obtained for analysis due to cellular damage. only one study reported a sensitivity of 100% for the detection of FCoV antigen in effusion by immunofluorescence staining [128]. a decreasing sensitivity could be observed with increasing time interval between sampling and analysis. study sample material Number of Samples Assay Sensitivity Specificity Reference Standard for FIP Control Cats. IFA 95% 100% Histopathology Diseases other than FIP. topathologically and IHC was negative in all cats. sensitivity surprisingly decreased to 78%, whereas specificity slightly increased to 88%. sensitivity was 91% and specificity only 50%. the results of the only prospective study that evaluated ICC in aqueous humor in cats with immunohistochemically confirmed FIP and control cats with similar clinical signs. the technique only has a moderate sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of FIP, and therefore, it cannot be used as a single confirming diagnostic test. IHC was shown to have excellent sensitivity of 97\u2013100% in cats with histopathologically confirmed FIP [115,116] and also specificity of up to 100% to exclude FIP in control cats with other diseases diagnosed by histopathology [115] ICC 53% 91% Histopathology/IHC of other organs Diseases other than FIP FNA = fine-needle aspirate; ICC = immunocytochemistry; n. d. = not determined; TCB = Tru-cut biopsies. a false positive immunocytochemical result was found in a mesenteric lymph node sample, resulting in a specificity of only 91% [118] fluorescein-conjugated antibodies are used to detect FCoV antigen in effusions. this test was reported to have an excellent specificity of 100%. but more recent investigations also showed positive results of immunofluorescence or ICC in cats with effusions caused by other diseases than FIP. samples were analyzed within 24 hours after collection [128]. longer intervals between sampling and analysis could result in decreasing sensitivities. FCoV antigen could still be detected for at least two days in samples stored at 4 \u00b0C or room temperature [128] FIP [128] Ascites or pleural effusion FIP (n = 10) Controls (n = 7) IFA 100% 71% Histopathology Diseases other than FIP.

RT-PCR is frequently used to amplify FCoV RNA in different materials. cat with FIP exhibit much higher viral loads than healthy FECV-infected cats. cat with FIP exhibit much higher viral loads than healthy FECV-infected cats. a relative FCoV copy number was assigned to a relative copy number of 1. a relative copy number was then calculated for each RT-PCR-positive sample. a positive RT-PCR result with a high viral load is at least very suggestive for FIP [138] histopathology/IHC Diseases other than FIP [119] FNA of mesenteric lymph nodes FIP (n = 20) Controls (n = 26) RT-qPCR 90% 96% Histopathology or diagnostic algorithm Healthy or diseases other than FIP [139] Various tissues FIP (n = 32) Controls (n = 41) Real-time RT-PCR 96% 78% Histopathology/IHC Diseases other than FIP [140] FNA of various studies using RT-PCR to target FCoV RNA in tissue samples are summarized in Table 9. in cats with FIP, real-time RT-PCR was positive in the spleen in 60% of cases, in mesenteric lymph nodes in 87% and in the bone marrow in 67% of cases. in healthy FECV-infected cats, FCoV RNA was found in the spleen in 38%. RT-PCR is more specific for FIP than healthy FECV-infected cats. it was hypothesized that this RT-PCR would only detect FIPV from cats with FIP but not FECV from healthy FECV-infected cats. ric lymph node FNA can be a sensitive and specific method to diagnose FIP. RT-PCR was initially developed using primers for the highly conserved 3\u2019-untranslated region (3\u2019-UTR) of the FCoV genome in order to detect all known FCoV isolates. RT-PCR could not differentiate between FECV and FIPV, nor could it distinguish FCoV isolates. studies evaluating the use of RT-PCR in serum, plasma or whole blood confirmed this finding of possible FCoV viremia in cats without FIP. none of the healthy cats that tested positive for genomic or replicating FCoV developed FIP or clinical illness within six months of testing. study sample Material Number of Samples RT-PCR Assay Sensitivity Specificity Reference Standard for FIP Control Cats [143] Serum, plasma FIP (n = 17) Controls (n = 15) RT-nPCR 56\u201375% 75\u201388% Histopathology Healthy or diseases other than FIP [145] Plasma FIP (n = 42) Controls (n = 141) RT-nPCR 71% 89% Histopathology Healthy or diseases other than FIP [106] Histopathology/IHC Healthy [149] Serum, PBMC FIP (n = 43) Controls (n = 49) Real-time RT-PCR 15\u201329% 100% Histopathology or detection of FCoV antigen in effusion Diseases other than FIP [155] Whole blood FCoV-positive(n = 4) FCoV-negative (n = 5) RT-LAMP 25\u201350% 100% RT-nPCR Diseases other than FIP [156] study included 63 serum samples from 62 cats with abdominal clinical signs. sensitivity and specificity could not be determined. one of these cats survived for almost three years after examination. a RT-PCR amplifying FCoV mRNA has been developed in order to increase specificity of RNA detection in blood. this assay really did not detect FCoV mRNA in any of the control cats with clinical signs indicative of FIP but other confirmed diseases. however, subsequent studies also identified FCoV mRNA, and thus replicating FCoV in 0.5\u201352% blood samples from healthy cats. RT-nPCR was used as reference standard in cats with suspected FIP. sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 100% in all materials; sensitivity was only low to moderate. sensitivity of RT-LAMP was 100% in all materials; sensitivity was only low to moderate.

RT-PCR already detects small amounts of viral RNA, which can potentially leak from blood into effusion in cats without FIP. FIP was confirmed by histopathology or detection of FCoV antigen and control groups consisted of cats with diseases other than FIP (either only neurologic or also non-neurologic diseases with clinical signs consistent with FIP) the blood-brain barrier has not specifically been examined in cats with FIP yet, it can be assumed that it is impaired secondary to the inflammation caused by FIP [163. FECV could pass the blood-brain barrier in cats with neurologic diseases other than FIP. one study detected a correlation between high anti-FCoV antibodies and positive RT-PCR in the CSF. however, the aqueous humor was not confirmed in the cats in this study. IHC and control groups either consisted of cats with diseases other than FIP or cats euthanized due to behavioral conditions. studies using RT-PCR to target FCoV RNA in tissues are summarized in Table 9. FCoV RNA was identified in 88% cats with clinically suspected FIP. 100% of experimentally infected cats tested positive for FCoV mRNA. however, the detection of FCoV RNA in tissue is not specific for FIP. in cats with FIP, real-time RT-PCR was positive in 60% of cases. mesenteric lymph nodes (100%), spleen (88%), lung (86%), liver (75%), bronchial lymph nodes (67%), kidneys (63%) and intestine (60%). recent studies evaluated the use of a quantitative RT-PCR (RT-qPCR) to detect FCoV RNA in FNA samples of the mesenteric lymph nodes. RT-PCR was initially developed using primers for the highly conserved 3\u2019-untranslated region (3\u2019-UTR) of the FCoV genome in order to detect all known FCoV isolates. however, it was assumed only FIPV would be detectable in blood. however, it has been shown that FCoV RNA could also be detected in the blood of asymptomatic cats and cats with diseases other than FIP. most studies used histopathology as reference standard [16,80,106,143,145,148,149]. one study also used the detection of FCoV antigen in macrophages in effusion [149] RT-nPCR 53% 88% Histopathology Diseases other than FIP [148] PBMC FIP (n = 81) Controls (n = 17) RT-PCR for mRNA 93% 100% Histopathology Healthy or diseases other than FIP [151] Whole blood FIP (n = 1) Controls (n = 25) RT-PCR for mRNA 100% 48% Clinical suspicion Healthy [150] Whole blood FIP (n = 10) Controls (n = 40) RT-nPCR 14% 100% Histopathology or IHC Diseases other than FIP [15] Whole blood FIP (n = 8) Controls (n = 8) RT-nPCR 75% 100% Histopathology/IHC Diseases other than FIP [147] Buffy coat Controls (n = 205) RT-qPCR for mRNA n. d. 99.5% None Healthy [141] Buffy coat, serum or whole blood FIP (n = 20) FCoV viremia can be detected by RT-PCR in up to 80\u201390% of FECV-infected cats without FIP [106] RT-PCR in blood samples should not be used to confirm a diagnosis of FIP. RT-PCR had better sensitivity when peripheral blood mononuclear cells were used compared to serum [149]. RT-PCR based on primer-probe energy transfer detecting and quantifying subgenomic FCoV mRNA showed a very good sensitivity and specificity in one study. RT-LAMP (RT-LAMP) has been used to amplify FCoV RNA in cats with suspected FIP in a recent study. one study included 27 cats with a suspicion of FIP, of which only 13 had histopathologic confirmation of the disease. another study examined 61 effusion samples from cats with suspected FIP based on effusion feature criteria established by the European Advisory Board on Cat Diseases in 2009 [88]. the diagnosis was, however, not confirmed by reference standard methods in any of the cats.

CSF All studies evaluating RT-PCR for the detection of FCoV RNA have reported specificities of 100%. the control groups consisted of cats with neurologic diseases only [45] or also included cats with non-neurologic diseases but clinical signs consistent with FIP [135,162] real-time RT-PCR 42% 100% Histopathology or detection of FCoV antigen in effusion Diseases other than FIP [135] CSF FIP with neurological and/or ocular signs (n = 7) Controls with neurological and/or ocular signs (n = 3) Real-time RT-PCR 86% 100% Histopathology or detection of FCoV antigen in effusion Diseases other than FIP. cats with low, but in 100% of samples from cats with high CSF antibody titers. FCoV RNA was not amplified in any of the antibody-negative cats. however, FIP was not confirmed in the cats in this study. multiple individual mutations occur during each cycle of viral replication. it is hypothesized that specific mutations then lead to the development of the virulent pathotype FIPV and trigger the tropism switch from enterocytes to macrophages as a key event in FIP pathogenesis. two single nucleotide polymorphisms were found that only were present in the FCoV from cats with FIP but not in the FCoV from healthy cats. the detection of one of the SNP allowed differentiation between FCoV from cats with FIP and healthy cats in 96% of the examined FCoV. both SNP led to the substitution of methionine by leucine at amino acid position 1058 within the putative fusion peptide of the S protein. a number of studies subsequently investigated the prevalence of the mutations in tissue samples from cats with and without FIP [185] Sensitivity and specificity from different studies evaluating the detection of feline coronavirus spike (S) gene mutations in tissue samples. real-time RT-PCR 71% 100% Histopathology/IHC Diseases other than FIP [141] Real-time RT-PCR 15\u201350% n. d.

RT-nPCR was negative in all of the blood samples from cats without FIP. specificity of the sequencing step could not be determined from that study.
