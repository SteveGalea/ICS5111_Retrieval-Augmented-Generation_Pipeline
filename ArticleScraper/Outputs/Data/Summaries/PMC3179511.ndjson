{"summary": "the capsid protein open reading frame 2 (ORF2) induces endoplasmic reticulum stress in ORF2 expressing cells. the pro-apoptotic gene CHOP is an important trigger to initiate endoplasmic reticulum stress induced apoptosis. the viral genome has three open reading frames called ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3. the nonstructural proteins required for virus replication and protein processing are encoded by ORF1 and ORF2. in insect cells, the truncated 56 kDa ORF2 protein can self-assemble to form virus-like particles. ER stress can lead to an activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). it is mediated by inositol requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1), activating transcription factor (ATF6) and PKR-like ER kinase (PERK). different viruses use the three branches differentially. Hsp72 is known to inhibit the stress induced c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway [23], cytochrome release [24], and Bax translocation to mitochondria. ORF2 protein up-regulates the chaperones Hsp72 and Hsp70B' as well as the co-chaperone Hsp40. luciferase reporter construct was driven by the full-length 954 bp CHOP promoter. pcDNA3.1 or pcDNA-HEV ORF2 was transfected into hepatoma derived human lung cancer cells. similar findings were also observed in the non-hepatic cell line H1299. H1299 cells were transfected with 0.1 g of pGL3CHOP promoter luciferase reporter plasmid and 1.0 g of pcDNA3.1-Chikungunya virus capsid. the samples were processed and analyzed as shown in (a) luciferase reporter tested effects of promoter constructs with deletions. ERSE and AP1 elements of the CHOP promoter were only weakly activated by the capsid protein. ORF2 activates PERK mediated eIF2 phosphorylation during ER stress. cells were transduced with Ad-GFP and Ad-ORF2 for 48 hours. phospho eIF2 signals were normalized to total eIF2 levels. thapsigargin efficiently induced apoptosis as detected by FACS analysis. no signs of apoptosis were found in ORF2 expressing cells. the heat shock family of proteins prevents the irreversible aggregation of unfolded proteins. the presence of ORF2 protein leads to the coordinated regulation of chaperones as well as the co-chaperone in response to protein damaging stress. expression levels were normalized to Ad-GFP transduced cells as control. Error bars indicate mean S.D. of three independent experiments. ORF2 interacts with Hsp72 HEV ORF2 protein. ORF2 protein was detected from immunoprecipitates by Western blotting. the major heat shock protein Hsp72 is well known for its critical role in cell survival. ORF2 activates the CHOP promoter Processing of hepatitis E virus proteins leads to the accumulation in the ER of the viral capsid protein ORF2. the ER resident chaperones GRP78 and GRP94 as well as the protein disulfide isomerase have been shown to be up-regulated in ORF2 expressing cells. the specificity of CHOP activation by ORF2 was confirmed by the inability of ORF2 to activate a non-UPR gene promoter. thapsigargin treated cells served as a positive control compared to untreated cells. pcDNA3.1-HEV ORF2 protein expression at 48 hours post-transfection was verified by Western blot analysis. ORF2 activates both the AARE and ERSE elements of the CHOP promoter. ORF2 activates the phosphorylation of eIF2. it is well established that ER stress leads to activation of the three signaling branches of UPR. overexpression of CHOP leads to decrease in the B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 protein level. under normal conditions Bax is located in the cytoplasm. thapsigargin efficiently induced apoptosis as detected by FACS analysis. qRT-PCR experiments confirmed the microarray results. ORF2 overexpression caused approximately 4-fold, 3-fold, and 20-fold up-regulation of Hsp40, Hsp72 and the co-chaperone Hsp40. expression profiles of host genes significantly regulated (1.7 fold; p value0.05) at 60 hours post infection of Huh7 cells with Ad-ORF2 versus Ad-GFP. expression levels were normalized to Ad-GFP transduced cells as control. the best fit model scores a global energy (GE) value of 71.90, attractive and repulsive van der Waals force (Avwf) of 45.23, repulsive van der Waals energy (Rvdw), 21.10 and atomic contact energy (ACE)-17.66. the model indicates docking with the C-terminal or P domain of HEV ORF2 as shown before for its interaction with GRP78 [46]. Huh7 cells infected with Ad-ORF2 or Ad-GFP showed ORF2 protein promotes nuclear accumulation of Hsp72. Hsp72 was mostly detected in the nuclear fraction of ORF2 expressing cells. ER stress response in mammalian cells involves the two major phases of adaptation and apoptosis. ER stress is induced by three different pathways that are mediated by PKR-like ER kinase PERK, ATF6a and b as well as IRE1a and b as well as IRE1a and b. eIF2 leads to a general attenuation of protein synthesis. this promotes translation of certain mRNAs such as the mRNA encoding the transcription factor ATF4 which also binds to the AARE regulatory sites of the CHOP promoter. otic conditions and translocates to mitochondria in response to apoptotic stimuli. this clearly suggests that activation of CHOP by ORF2 protein did not execute the apoptotic markers like Bax translocation events. findings are in agreement with recent data of dengue virus infection. induction of ER stress caused by ORF2 protein also induced nuclear accumulation of Hsp72. exposure to toxicants like dimethylarsinic acid also causes nuclear accumulation of Hsp72. this in turn may protect the host cells from ER stress mediated apoptosis during HEV infection. plasmid constructs and antibodies H1299 and HEK293 cells were obtained from ATCC and Huh7 cells from R. Bartenschlager, university of Heidelberg, Germany. cells were maintained in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (PAA) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (Biochrom), 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PAA) and 0.5% amphotericin (PAA) at 37\u00b0C. primary antibodies used were mouse anti-Hsp72 (Stressgen Biotechnologies), rabbit anti-His probe, rabbit anti-Bax N-20 (Santa Cruz), rabbit anti-eIF2, rabbit anti-phospho-eIF2/Ser51, rabbit anti-COX IV (Cell Signaling Technology), and mouse anti-Actin (Sigma) secondary antibodies were: peroxidase-conjugate anti-mouse IgG, (GE Healthcare), anti-rabbit Ig microarray analysis Gene expression microarray analysis was performed using Ad-ORF2 with Ad-GFP transduced Huh7 cells. total RNA was isolated 60 hours post transduction using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) five micrograms of total RNA were used to prepare biotinylated cRNA probes. expression levels of Hsp40/DNAJ4 were detected by using the specific TaqMan probe.
