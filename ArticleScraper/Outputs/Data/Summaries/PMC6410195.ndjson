{"summary": "proteases play an important role in the activation of precursor proteins to mature forms, the recycling of proteins, and other essential functions in the body. most proteases recognize specific sequences of amino acids in their substrates and cleave the peptide bond between the P1 and P1\u2019 residues. a disintegrin and metalloproteinase domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), -secretase, -secretase 1, and MMP-24; (3) inflammation (arthritis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, Crohn\u2019s disease, inflammatory bowel disease, colitis, diverticulitis, chronic liver disease) there are physiological protease inhibitors in the body which help to maintain a protease\u2013protease inhibitor balance commercially available synthetic protease inhibitors targeting host proteases include thrombin and Factor Xa inhibitors for coagulation. commercially available synthetic protease inhibitors targeting host proteases include thrombin and Factor Xa inhibitors for coagulation. the functional HIV protease is formed by two identical monomers of 99 amino acids. each protease monomer contributes one catalytic aspartic acid (25 and 25\u2019 Asp) in the active site. a hydrophobic amino acid at P1 is required for efficient cleavage by HIV-1 protease. avir, nelfinavir, amprenavir, fosamprenavir, lopinavir, atazanavir, tipranavir, and darunavir are peptidomimetic inhibitors that target the active site. most commercially available drugs use a noncleavable hydroxyethylene or hydroxyethylamine moiety as the basic core [8]. HCV encodes an NS2-3 autoprotease and a NS3-4A serine protease. NS3 is comprised of protease (N-terminal, 200 aa) and helicase domains (C-terminal), and forms a heterodimer with NS4A (54-residue protein) the S1 pocket of NS3 protease prefers small, hydrophobic residues (such as cysteine) at the P1 position of its substrates [17]. HCV NS3-4A is known to have a shallow binding pocket requiring an extended subtrate spanning 10 amino acid residues (P6 to P4\u2019) for efficient enzyme activity. the macrocyclic compounds, shown in Figure 6, display significantly improved EC50 values over Telaprevir and Boceprevir, the first-generation protease inhibitors [20]. both boceptrevir and Telatrevir contain an -ketoamide warhead, a small residue at the P1 position and a Pro or Pro surrogate at the P2 position. norwalk virus (NV) is the first known norovirus, and serves as a prototype strain. GII.4 and newly emerging GII.17 strains are primarily responsible for most infections and outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis. most common routes of virus transmission are fecal\u2013oral, food- or waterborne, aerosol and person-to-person. morbidity is high in immunocompromised individuals, young children, and the elderly. the active sites of norovirus 3CLPro from diverse noroviruses and related caliciviruses are well-conserved [30] the mechanism of action of norovirus 3CLPro is similar to that established for related cysteine proteases where Cys139 acts as a nucleophile. the efficacy of each inhibitor was evaluated using norovirus 3CLPro from GI and GII strains [36], NV replicon harboring cells [31] and MNV-1 [32]. the inclusion of a glutamine surrogate at the P1 position was found to be crucial for efficient inhibitory activity. a latent aldehyde warhead, such as an aldehyde bisulfite adduct, reverts to the precursor aldehyde under physiological conditions. the pharmacological activity of the bisulfite adducts of peptidyl aldehydes was shown to be comparable to those of the precursor aldehydes. cyclohexyl ring is positioned tightly, optimally filling the hydrophobic S2 subsite of NV Pro. m-chlorophenyl ring occupies a hydrophobic pocket near Ile109 and Val168. EC50 values against MNV-1 were also well correlated with EC50 values in NV replicon harboring cells. yl group in the cap allows for interactions with hydrophobic residues in S4. 4.3. Prodrug Approach The prodrug approach has been highly successful in improving the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME)/PK characteristics of HIV and HCV protease inhibitors. prodrugs showed lower or low cytotoxicity, increased stability in liver microsomes and reduced plasma protein binding. peptidyl transition-state mimic in a -strand conformation suitable for binding to the active site of a protease. this invariably increases affinity by reducing the loss of entropy upon inhibitor binding. macrocyclization generally enhances drug-like characteristics [43]. three different classes (A\u2013C) of macrocyclic inhibitors were synthesized. the P2 position and the length and nature of the linker were examined for optimal efficacy against the enzyme. similar tripeptidyl compounds with acyclic amides [50] or a 6-membered lactam ring [51] at the P1 position were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-norovirus effects. however, their efficacy was lower than that of NPI52 in enzyme- or cell-based assays [49,50,51]. drug-like small-molecule inhibitors (GC376-like molecules) of coronaviruses and noroviruses can serve as potential antiviral therapeutics. we have synthesized dipeptidyl and tripeptidyl compounds containing a glutamine surrogate at the P1 position. TS mimics such as -hydroxyphosphonates and -hydroxyesters were also investigated. a latent aldehyde warhead, such as an aldehyde bisulfite adduct, reverts to the precursor aldehyde under physiological conditions was used [37]. a large conformational change occurs in a nearby active site loop to accommodate inhibitor binding [30]. RET assay using 3CLPro of GI and GII noroviruses (IC50) and cell based assays (EC50) revealed that replacing Leu at R2 with cyclohexylalanine (GC543) increased potency significantly. the substitution of R2 with a m-Cl substituent further increased potency (IC50 100 nM and EC50 20 nM) the synthesized compounds showed high potency in inhibiting norovirus replication in cells. increased potency is correlated to interactions between the S4 subsite and the cap residue. the m-Cl benzyl group in the cap allows for interactions with hydrophobic residues in S4. macrocyclic norovirus 3CLPro inhibitors are known to recognize their ligands in the -strand conformation [40]. this invariably increases affinity by reducing the loss of entropy upon inhibitor binding. macrocyclization increases cellular permeability, especially when the design includes the formation of an intramolecular hydrogen bond. X-ray co-crystallization with macrocyclic compounds showed that the number of hydrogen bonds between NV 3CLPro and the inhibitors decreased in comparison with the non-macrocyclic dipeptidyl compounds. three different classes (A\u2013C) of macrocyclic inhibitors were synthesized. the P2 position, and the length and nature of the linker were examined for optimal efficacy against the enzyme and viral replication. tripeptidyl compounds were highly effective in the FRET and cell-based assays. similar compounds with acyclic amides or a 6-membered lactam ring at the P1 position were synthesized and evaluated for their anti-norovirus effects. GC376 (bisulfite adduct of corresponding aldehyde GC373) potently inhibits feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cell culture. we determined the efficacy of GC376 against FIP in cats as a proof-of-concept study using experimentally-infected pathogen-free cats."}
