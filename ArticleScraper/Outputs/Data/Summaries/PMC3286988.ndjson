{"summary": "conditional targeting of E2-2 causes constitutive loss of pDCs. the development and maintenance of pDCs is controlled by transcription factor E2-2 (gene symbol Tcf4), whose global deletion leads to specific loss of pDCs. x-Cre littermate controls (Ctrl) shows the pDC population in CKO mice. shown are staining profiles of total splenocytes with the CD11chi MHC class II+ (MHCII) cDC subset highlighted. adult E2-2 CKO mice manifest phenotypic and functional loss of peripheral pDCs. innate control of MHV requires TLR7, IFN-I signaling, and the presence of pDCs, which secrete IFN-I to protect cDCs. the precise role of pDCs in the early innate control of viral infections varies in different viruses and infection models. however, pDCs appear to be absolutely essential for IFN-I\u2013mediated protection against MHV, a prototypical acute cytopathic coronavirus. LCMV Armstrong was fully cleared from all organs by day 8. pDCs are dispensable for the control of acute LCMV infection. mice were infected with a relatively high dose (105 pfu) of persistent LCMV strain Docile. CKO mice or littermate controls were infected with 105 pfu of LCMV Docile. LCMV-specific T-cell responses were analyzed on days 7 and 30. splenocytes were stained with LCMV peptide-MHC class I tetramers. the frequency of CD4+ T cells producing IFN- in response to LCMV peptide gp61 was severely reduced on day 7. this reduction was not the result of increased regulatory T-cell expansion in CKO mice. pDCs are required for optimal differentiation of IFN-\u2013producing CD4+ T cells during chronic LCMV infection. pDC deficiency impairs CD4+ T-cell response to chronic LCMV infection. the indicated mice were infected with 105 pfu of LCMV Docile. the absence of pDCs impairs the induction of CD4+ T-cell response. IFNAR-deficient (Thy1.1 Ly5.1+) SM1 T cells were transferred into LCMV-infected control or CKO mice. a 1:1 mixture of wild-type and IFNAR-deficient SMARTA T cells was transferred into control or CKO. IFNAR-deficient T cells were barely detectable in control and CKO mice. pDC-deficient animals show defective induction of an antiviral CD4+ T-cell response. pDC deficiency causes a qualitative impairment of an LCMV-specific adaptive response. the number of pDCs used for adoptive transfer (5 103) was much higher than the estimated number of endogenous gp33-specific T cells (41) this number supported reproducible transfer and detection of T cells (42) and circumvented the need for endogenous CD4+ T-cell help. LCMV peptide gp33-specific P14 TCR transgenic CD8+ T cells were analyzed on day 1. shown is the fraction of transferred T cells among the splenic CD8+ T-cell population in control or CKO mice. conditional targeting of E2-2 causes Constitutive Loss of pDCs. null and one LoxP-flanked E2-2 allele (Itgax-Cre+ Tcf4flox/), Cre recombination occurred primarily in cDCs and pDCs. the pDC population was reduced significantly in the bone marrow. the control and CKO animals were on a homogeneous (B6 129)F1 background and therefore were suitable for functional studies. the increase of the cDC fraction in cKO spleens is significant (P = 0.006) the B220+ CD8+ cDC-like cells arising from E2-2\u2013deficient peripheral pDCs (28) could not be detected reliably in CKO mice. innate control of MHV requires TLR7, IFN-I signaling, and presence of pDCs, which secrete IFN-I to protect cDCs and macrophages. two days after MHV infection, CKO mice showed reduced serum IFN- levels (Fig. 2A) and up to 1,000fold elevated viral load in the liver and spleen. mice were infected with 50 pfu MHV A59 and analyzed 48 h later. pDCs produce IFN-I early upon LCMV infection. pDC depletion did not affect systemic IFN-I production. CKO mice or littermate controls were infected with 105 pfu of LCMV Docile. viral titers in blood were determined at the indicated time points postinfection. LCMV-specific T-cell responses were analyzed on days 7 or 30. splenocytes highlighting gp33-specific CD8+ T cells and gp33-responsive IFN-\u2013\u2013producing CD8+ T cells. data shown are mean SD of 8\u201311 mice pooled from three independent experiments. p.i., postinfection. pDCs are required for Helper T-Cell Response to Persistent LCMV infection. transgenic CD4+ T cells expressing the TCR specific for the LCMV peptide gp61 (SMARTA T cells) were adoptively transferred into recipient mice that had been infected with LCMV Docile 1 d before the transfer, and their expansion was measured 7 d later. a 1:1 mixture of wild-type (Thy1.1+ Ly5.1) and IFNAR-deficient (Thy1.1 Ly5.1+) SM1 T cells was transferred into LCMV-infected control and CKO mice. a 1:1 mixture of wild-type (Thy1.1+ Ly5.1) and IFNAR-deficient (Thy1.1 Ly5.1+) SM1 T cells was transferred into LCMV-infected control or CKO recipients. SM1 T cells were transferred into LCMV-infected control (MT:WT) or pDC-specific MHC class II knockout (MTPIII+IV-KO:WT) mice. the results are shown as in E (mean SD; n = 4). ficiency causes a qualitative impairment of an LCMV-specific adaptive response rather than a mere delay in LCMV clearance. we used mice that lack MHC class II expression selectively in pDCs. these mice harbor targeted mutation of the cell type-specific promoters III and IV of the MHC class II transactivator. expanded T cells showed normal expression levels of PD-1 and BTLA. pDCs are not required directly for CD8+ T-cell expansion. absence of pDCs does not directly affect CD8+ T-cell response to chronic LCMV infection. transgenic CD8+ T cells were transferred into LCMV-infected control and CKO mice on day 8 (mean SD) the absence of pDCs is detrimental and could not be compensated by other cell types in two virus infection models, acute MHV and chronic LCMV Docile. pDCs facilitate antiviral T-cell responses through a direct effect on CD4+ T cells. only CD4+ but not CD8+ LCMV-specific T cells were dependent on presence of pDCs in adoptive recipients. pDCs were required to induce the clonal expansion of virus-specific CD4+ T cells. mice carrying the conditional Tcf4flox allele with dendritic cell-specific Itgax-Cre deleter transgene (C57BL/6 background) and mice carrying the Tcf4 germline null allele (129SvEvTac background) were intercrossed to generate CKO (Tcf4flox/ Itgax-Cre+) and sex-matched littermate control (Tcf4flox/+ Itgax p33-41 (P14) Thy1.1+ (40) and P14+ IFNAR/ Ly5.1+ were provided by M.
