{"summary": "hmatopoietic stem cell transplantation is increasingly used worldwide for definitive treatment of hematologic malignancy and other conditions. patients undergo high dose conditioning chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy with a view to eradicate their immune system along with any residual malignant cells. HSCT may be autologous (where the donor stem cells are the patient\u2019s own) or allogeneic (where the donor stem cells are from an appropriately matched donor) a substantial number of patients present with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates. the underlying etiology is often not known at the time of presentation. the principles of ARDS management and prevention are equally valid in this population. patients should be evaluated for possible etiologies for their presentation. these can be divided broadly into infectious and non-infectious causes. bacterial pneumonias most commonly occur in the early transplant period. antibacterial agents should be broadened to cover nosocomial pathogens. pneumoniae is 30 times more prevalent in HSCT recipients compared to the general population. sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim is the treatment of choice and response to therapy is typically robust. allotransplants receiving grafts from seropositive donors and those with graft-versus-host disease are at increased risk of HSV. low-grade HSV reactivation and viral shedding is not uncommon in critical illness. low grade CMV shedding is not uncommon in critical illness. enza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus can occur during the entire post-transplant period. enza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus can occur during the entire post-transplant period. monotherapy with isavuconazole or voriconazole is preferred first-line treatment. recurrent hemoptysis may be considered for surgical evaluation. lung resection is highly morbid and associated with significant mortality in this population. there is limited guidance and no consensus on which patients outside of HIV-positive individuals should receive prophylaxis. graft-versus-host disease, delayed engraftment and a prolonged period of neutropenia should be suspected. encapsulated organisms are a concern late after HSCT. ideally, microbiological sampling from bronchoalveolar lavage is preferred. mycobacterial pneumonia is rare, but can occur in the late post-transplant period, and typically presents one year after HSCT. incidence of mycobacteria tuberculosis among HSCT recipients is higher in endemic areas and those receiving allogeneic grafts are similar to that of the general population. the epidemiology of post-HSCT CMV pneumonitis may change if novel CMV prophylactic agents are routinely administered[36]. the community-acquired respiratory viruses (CARV), including influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus can occur during the entire post-transplant period[37-39]. risk factors include allogeneic transplant, unrelated donors, prolonged neutropenia, immunosuppressant use for graft-versus-host disease, and CMV infection. most common findings radiologically include pulmonary nodules with or without halo sign, ground glass opacities, and an air crescent sign from necrotic tissue in advanced cases[47-49]. patients with PCP typically die due to refractory hypoxemia from severe respiratory failure. adjunctive corticosteroids are typically administered in individuals with HSCT who develop PCP. PERDS is a pulmonary subset of the engraftment syndrome. risk factors include female gender, blood product administration, rapid engraftment, and HSCT for the POEMS syndrome. treatment consists of short courses of high-dose corticosteroids, most commonly 1 to 2 mg/kg methylprednisolone twice daily for 3 d, followed by a rapid taper[65,67]. one study showed improved survival in 8 patients treated with anti-fibrinolytic aminocaproic acid[70], a subsequent larger study failed to show benefit[75]. further, even in the presence of thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusion did not affect morbidity or mortality in DAH[68]. etanercept was added to corticosteroid therapy, though findings were not replicated when a randomized controlled trial design was applied. further studies are needed to better phenotype what IPS truly represents. PVOD should be suspected in those who are dyspneic, have evidence of pulmonary hypertension in the absence of left heart failure. pulmonary toxicity syndrome (DPTS) is a constellation of interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis occurring in the late transplant period. DPTS occurs late following HSCT and can present several years after HSCT. symptoms are non-specific and include dyspnea, fevers, and nonproductive cough. COP is responsive to corticosteroid therapy and typical regimens include 1 mg/kg prednisone daily with an extended taper up to 6 mo[94,95,97] cases fatality rates are reported up to 20%, and are usually due to respiratory failure in the setting of relapsed, steroid-refractory disease[97,98]. post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) is a rare form of malignancy secondary to EBV-infected B lymphocytes occurring in the first six months following allotransplant. risk factors include T-cell depleted donors, HLA donor mismatch, T-cell depleting therapies including antithymocyte globulin and anti-CD3 antibodies, and CMV antigens. focused studies of PERDS patients found an incidence of nearly 5% in autotransplants. risk factors include female gender, blood product administration, rapid engraftment, and HSCT for the POEMS syndrome. radiographic changes consistent with lung injury precede neutrophil engraftment. treatment of IPS consists of high-dose corticosteroids, most commonly 500 to 1000 mg methylprednisolone per day for 5 d[70,72,74-76]. a subsequent larger study failed to show benefit[75]. further, even in the presence of thrombocytopenia, platelet transfusion did not affect mortality in DAH[68]. preliminary retrospective studies have shown promise with increased response rates and improved overall survival when TNF- inhibitor, etanercept, was added to corticosteroid therapy[80,81]. further studies are needed to better phenotype what IPS truly represents, and whether any therapies can be effective. delayed pulmonary toxicity syndrome (DPTS) is a constellation of interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis occurring in the late transplant period. symptoms are non-specific and include dyspnea, fevers, and nonproductive cough. DPTS occurs late following HSCT and can present several years after HSCT. COP occurs in up to 10% of HSCT recipients and typically presents late following transplant. risk factors include cyclophosphamide conditioning, total body irradiation, male allotransplants with a female cell donor, presence of graft-versus-host disease, and HSCT for leukemia. COP is responsive to corticosteroid therapy and typical regimens include 1 mg/kg prednisone daily with an extended taper up to 6 mo[94], despite extrapolated use from solid organ transplant patients, macrolides have shown to worsen airflow decline-free survival in HSCT recipients. other therapies with inconclusive utility include inhaled corticosteroids, intravenous immune globulin, TNF- inhibitors, cyclosporine, and tacrolimus. complications are differentiated by key distinguishing features and their time-course following transplantation. routine use of best-practice lung-protective strategies is recommended even once the explanation for the respiratory failure is identified."}
