{"summary": "mammarenaviruses comprise 35 currently recognized species that are classified into two main groups, Old World (OW) and New World (NW) viruses are divided into Clade A, Clade A-recombinant (Clade D), Clade B, and Clade C, according to their phylogenetic relationships. OW mammarenaviruses include the prototypic lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), of worldwide distribution, and other arenaviruses are enveloped viruses with a negative-sense RNA genome. the S segment encodes the nucleoprotein (NP) and the precursor of the envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC), while the L segment encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) and a matrix protein (Z) that is involved in virus assembly and budding. NP interacts with the Z matrix protein and contributes to the packaging of viral particles during virion morphogenesis [14,15,16]. NP contains a basic crevice, initially proposed to be an m7GTP cap binding site and later reported to function in binding RNA [17,18]. NP harbors a functional 3\u2032-5\u2032 exoribonuclease activity of the DExD/H-box protein family that has been shown to oppose the host type I interfer dystroglycan (-DG) is the principal receptor for LASV Entry Arenaviruses. DG is found in the extracellular compartment, where it binds components such as laminin. DG is expressed in most cell types, but its expression patterns and glycosylation levels differ depending on the tissue. -DG receptor requires a specific type of glycosylation for efficient virus attachment. like-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (LARGE) is required for the attachment of ligand-binding moieties to phosphorylated O-mannose on -DG. the encounter of cellular -DG with LASV GP induces tyrosine phosphorylation of -DG\u2019s cytosolic domain as well as it triggers -DG\u2019s dissociation from the cytoskeletal adaptor utrophin. this later step of detachment of virus-bound DG from the actin-based cytoskeleton may ease subsequent endocytosis of the virus\u2013receptor complex. TAM receptors have been shown to play a role in virus entry of several RNA viruses such as Ebola (EBOV), dengue (DENV) and Zika. this mechanism involves recognition of PtdSer exposed on the viral surface, incorporated from the cellular lipid bilayer during the budding process, as a signal for virus uptake [57,58,59]. cin I (TIM-1) has been recently identified as a PtdSer receptor for LASV entry [63] TIM receptors are cell surface glycoproteins that display an extracellular immunoglobulin variable-like domain (IgV), bearing a structural pocket with high affinity for PtdSer. this behavior resembles that of Axl, suggesting a similarity between the entry route promoted by TAM and TIM receptors. both DC-SIGN and LSECtin enhanced the susceptibility of cells to infection by LASV GP-pseudotyped lentivirus. none of these alternative receptors showed higher efficiency than properly modified -DG, the principal portal of entry for LASV [51] -binding receptors (TAM; TIM) and C-type lectin receptors (DC-SIGN; LSECtin) can mediate -DG-independent entry. TIM directly binds PtdSer molecules exposed on the viral envelope membrane. glycans on the LASV glycoprotein interact with glycans on the GP. haploid genetic screening in -DG-deficient cells pinpointed the lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) as a late endosomal co-receptor specifically required for efficient LASV entry. it is hypothesized that the acidic pH of the late endosome destabilizes the high affinity interaction between LASV GP and -DG, resulting in a \u201creceptor switch\u201d to LAMP1. mutations in ST3GAL4 yielding a specific deficiency in sialylation of LAMP1 totally abrogate its ability to interact with LASV GP to take place. this highlights the strict requirement of a specific glycosylated version of LAMP1 for the biochemical interaction with GP to take place. DG is expressed as a precursor and proteolytically cleaved to generate mature and subunits that together serve as a molecular bridge between the extracellular matrix and the cytoplasm. DG is found in the extracellular compartment, where it binds components such as laminin, and requires O-glycosylation to perform its biological functions. the GP ectodomain engages matriglycan via multiple contacts. it is reasonable to conceive that LASV would mimic the behavior of different host ECMs that normally interact with glycosylated membrane receptors to gain access to the cell. post-translational modification of -DG is required for both efficient LASV infection and laminin binding. TAM family members are tyrosine-kinases which expose tandem immunoglobulin-related domains to the extracellular matrix. these domains interact with host protein S (ProS) and growth arrest-specific gene 6 (Gas6), which are serum proteins that bind the negatively charged phospholipid phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) initial studies using a lentiviral vector pseudotyped with LASV GP showed no enhancement of LASV (or LCMV) entry upon overexpression of Axl in human embryonic kidney (HEK-293T) cells [61] and hypothesized that LASV internalization via -DG may be preferred over PtdSer receptors. TIM-I mediates entry of vesicular stomatitis virus pseudovirions bearing LASV GP, either in the absence DC-SIGN and LSECtin Lectin Receptors can Mediate LASV Cell Entry Two additional receptor candidates were identified in the cDNA screening studies. DC-SIGN and LSECtin lectin receptors were more effective at enhancing virus infection than TAM receptors, but none of these alternative receptors showed higher efficiency than properly modified -DG. dritic cells (MDDCs) lack expression of Axl and Tyro3. upregulated expression of DC-SIGN correlate with enhanced virus attachment. DC-SIGN and LSECtin may facilitate LASV entry into dendritic cells. OW arenaviruses enter the host cell by a clathrin-independent endocytic process followed by transport to late endosomal compartments. sodium hydrogen exchangers (NHEs) have been identified as host factors for LCMV and LASV, implicating macropinocytosis in arenavirus entry. a series of biochemical studies demonstrated that LAMP1 directly interacts with LASV GP in a pre-fusion configuration. the strength of this interaction is modulated by pH conditions, where a drop in pH can destabilize LASV GP affinity for -DG, thereby inducing potent binding to LAMP1. a drop in pH can destabilize LASV GP affinity for -DG. interactions involved in LASV entry disclose the diverse spectrum of mechanisms implemented by the virus to efficiently fulfill its internalization and fusion. the ability to utilize entry strategies alternative to -DG receptor (such as PtdSer or lectin receptors) provides the virion with versatility to enlarge its cell tropism and promotes access to selected cell-targets. DDX3 is a novel interacting partner of the OW LCMV and the NW JUNV NPs. lentiviral-mediated reconstitution of DDX3 gene has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in virus yields of LASV, LCMV or JUNV in cell culture. DDX3 is known to be involved in multiple steps of RNA metabolism. arenavirus mRNA analog was unaffected in DDX3-deficient cells. the pro-arenaviral activity of DDX3 strongly depends on DDX3\u2019s ability to promote viral RNA synthesis. however, alternative roles have been ascribed to DDX3 in the context of different viral infections. colocalization experiments have revealed the association of the NW arenavirus TCRV replication\u2013transcription complexes (RTCs) where NP accumulates, with G3BP1 and a non-canonical collection of ribosomal proteins, including the ribosomal proteins RPS6 and RPL10a. in this regard, the finding that JUNV infection inhibits SG formation might be related to the NP-mediated sequestration of DDX3 and other SG-related the LCMV L protein and the NP of LASV, LCMV, and/or JUNV have been confirmed as interactors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of other RNA viruses. DDX5 has been shown to interact with the C-terminal region of HCV NS5B, and has been suggested to be part of the HCV replicase complex. NPs of LASV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and/or Junn virus (JUNV) are depicted in green. a key question that needs to be addressed is how the polymerase switches from one mode to the other. a conformational transition of the polymerase from a monomeric state during transcription to an oligomeric state during replication might be hypothesized. the association with cellular partners may additionally modulate the switch from the transcriptase to the replicase mode of the arenavirus polymerase. DDX3 is the sole NP and L protein interactor for LASV or any other arenavirus. depletion of hnRNP A1 and A2 caused a strong inhibition of virus yield. hnRNP K, an LCMV and JUNV NP binding partner, has also been reported as a necessary host factor required for JUNV multiplication. hnRNP K has been shown to regulate the trafficking of HIV-1 genomic RNA. a recent proteomics approach based on JUNV Z has pinpointed a number of targets that were incorporated to Z virus-like particles (VLPs) and purified JUNV particles. this includes common interactors of the L and NP proteins, such as DDX3, DDX5, DHX9, hnRNPA2/B1, and PABP. DDX3 is a novel interacting partner of the OW LCMV and the NW JUNV NPs. lentiviral-mediated reconstitution of DDX3 gene has been shown to lead to a significant reduction in virus yields of LASV, LCMV or JUNV. DDX3 is known to be involved in multiple steps of RNA metabolism. DDX3 is considered an antiviral factor given it is involved in the innate immune response against some viruses such as HIV-1, DENV and HCV [105,106,107]. DDX3 is known to be an essential component for stress granule (SG) assembly, and to interact with other SG proteins, such as eIF4E. colocalization experiments have revealed the association of NW arenavirus TCRV replication\u2013transcription complexes (RTCs) where NP accumulates, with G3BP1 and a non-canonical collection of ribosomal proteins, including the ribosomal proteins RPS6 and RPL10a. in this regard, the finding that JUNV infection inhibits SG formation might be related to the NP-mediated sequestration of DDX3 and other SG-related proteins the dexD/Hbox protein family have been identified as potential overlapping targets of the LCMV L protein and the NP of LASV, LCMV, and/or JUNV. DDX5 has been shown to interact with the C-terminal region of HCV NS5B. DHX9 interacts with the viral genomic RNA and non-structural protein 3 (nsP3) within active replication complexes in Chikungunya virus (CHIKV)- hnRNPs identified among binding partners of LCMV, lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus, and/or Junn virus. targets common to the LCMV L polymerase are depicted in green. it is intriguing whether this is a consequence of conserved conformational structure shared among proteins from different families of viruses. a conformational transition of the polymerase from a monomeric state during transcription to an oligomeric state during replication might be hypothesized. it is probable that the association with cellular partners may additionally modulate the switch from the transcriptase to the replicase mode of the arenavirus polymerase. DDX3 is the sole NP and L protein interactor for LASV or any other arenavirus that has been demonstrated to contribute in viral RNA synthesis. depletion of hnRNP A1 and A2 caused strong inhibition of virus yield. hnRNP K, an LCMV and JUNV NP binding partner, has also been reported as a necessary host factor required for JUNV multiplication. studies from different groups have similarly ascribed relevant functions to hnRNPs in other viral infections. a recent proteomics approach based on JUNV Z has pinpointed a number of targets that were incorporated to Z virus-like particles (VLPs) and purified JUNV particles. this includes common interactions of the L and NP proteins, such as DDX3, DDX5, DHX9, hnRNPA2/B1, and PABP. studies on virus\u2013host interactions have also improved our understanding of the mechanisms driving LASV replication. a recent series of proteomic approaches oriented to the analysis of the interactome of arenavirus NP, L, and Z proteins in human cells singled out several host factors, such as DExD/H-box helicases."}
