{"summary": "studies have identified known respiratory viruses as the main causes of respiratory infections. a large proportion of respiratory illness remained undiagnosed because of a lack of widely used, accurate, and cost-effective diagnostics. recent advances in molecular biology have led to the development and availability of standardized diagnostic tests. in 2004, van Elden and others10 demonstrated the role of HCoVs as respiratory pathogens. HCoV-229 and/or HCoV-OC43 were detected in 11% of patients with respiratory tract infections compared with 0.4% in control subjects. however, there is still debate about the pathogenic role of HCoVs in upper and lower respiratory diseases. ILI was defined as fever (temperature 38\u00b0C) and either cough and/or sore throat in adults, adding runny nose in children. a questionnaire on potential risk factors and burden of disease was administered to all cases and a nasopharyngeal (NP) swab was collected for testing for influenza virus by real time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (real time RT-PCR) cases were followed for 15 days after symptom onset to record full clinical evolution and economic HCoVs were identified in 7 males and 4 females and were mostly children. there were three adults (31, 32, and 59 years old) no coinfection with HCoV and other viruses were noted. ten of the 11 persons with ILI in which HCoVs were identified had been sick between April and July. HCoVs are widely distributed across the country and circulate in urban as well as rural areas and at varied altitudes and conditions of temperature and humidity. this seasonal pattern could dilute the importance of these types of infections when examining only the yearly occurrence of this infections."}
