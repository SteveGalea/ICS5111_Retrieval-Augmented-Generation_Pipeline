{"summary": "exon skipping via splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) to bypass the mutated exons of dystrophin gene has shown great promise (4\u20136). this approach targets the splice sites of dystrophin pre-mRNA, induce exon skipping and enable the restoration of an open reading frame. studies were conducted with the arginine-rich (RXR)4 peptide (20,21) and later with its (RXRRBR)2 (B-peptide) derivative (22,23) both allowed exon skipping and dystrophin rescue at much lower doses than free SSOs in skeletal muscles. in parallel, a R6-Penetratin conjugate (R6-Pen) conjugate (25) was proposed and further modified to improve serum stability and biological activity profile unaided cellular uptake of PMO is thought to be dependent on increased sarcolemmal membrane permeability. lack of dystrophin renders the cellular membrane prone to mechanical stress-induced disruptions, making them leaky. unlabelled Pip6a-PMO was synthesized as previously described. cell culture Murine H2k mdx myoblasts were cultured in gelatin (0.01%)-coated flasks at 33\u00b0C, under 10% CO2, in Dulbecco\u2019s modified Eagles medium (DMEM PAA laboratories) primary cardiomyocytes were isolated from the ventricles of 1- to 2-day-old newborn wild-type C57BL/6 J mice (Charles River) or mdx mice (provided by M. Wood) by enzymatic digestion with type-4 collagenase (Serlabo Technologies) and pancreatin (Sigma-Aldrich), as described previously (31) freshly isolated cells were seeded in T25 flasks to allow selective adhesion of cardiac fibroblasts transfections were carried out in a final volume of 500 (12-well plate) or 2000 l (microscopy) for 4 h in OptiMEM or complete medium. cells were washed twice with PBS and lysed with 300 l GLB buffer. two microliters of the RT-PCR product was used as a template in secondary nested PCR using amplitaq gold DNA polymerase kit (Invitrogen Life Technology) products were fractionated by electrophoresis in 2.5% agarose gels (100 V for 1 h) 3 105 cells/dish of cardiomyocytes were seeded on gelatin (0.01%)-coated dishes. cells were then transfected with Pip6a-PMO-CF (1 M) or PMO-CF (1 M) for 1 h or 4 h. 10 l of trypan blue solution (Invitrogen Life technology) were added to each dish. peptide-PMO conjugates Pip6a (Ac-RXRRBRRXRYQFLIRXRBRXRB-OH, with B = -alanine and X = amino hexanoic acid) synthesis of peptide-PMO conjugates Pip6a (Ac-RXRRBRRXRYQFLIRXRBRXRB-OH, with B = -alanine and X = amino hexanoic acid) eomycin antibiotic mixture (PSN, Gibco) and 3 pg/l -interferon (PeproTech) were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% heat inactivated FBS (PAA laboratories) and 1% PSN. cells were seeded in gelatin (0.01%)-coated 24-well plates at a density of 4 105 cell/ml and left for 2 days at 33\u00b0C, 10% CO2, before being used as undifferentiated myo cardiomyocytes remaining in the supernatant were seeded in well culture plates coated with 0.01% gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich) the 8 104 cells/ml of cardiomyocytes were seeded on gelatin (0.01%)-coated 24 well-plates and grown until beating was observed (2\u20133 days. cells were incubated with 3\u2032-fluorescein-labelled Pip6a-PMO, unlabelled Pip6a-PMO or 3 RNA was extracted using a Nucleospin kit (Macherey-Nagel) from each single well for the 24 h treatment or by Trizol extraction (TRI Reagent\u00ae RNA Isolation Reagent, Sigma-Aldrich) RT-PCR and nested PCR The 400 ng of RNA template was used in a 2-step RT-PCR reaction using gene-specific primers. is in 2.5% agarose gels (100 V for 1 h) and quantified for percentage of exon skipping (%ES) by densitometric analysis (BioRad) 4 104 cells/ml were seeded on gelatin (0.01%)-coated 24-well plates and grown for 2 days before differentiation. 3 105 cells/dish of cardiomyocytes were seeded on gelatin (0.01%)-coated dishes and grown until cells were beating (2\u20133 days) cells were then transfected with Pip6a-PMO-CF (1 M) or PMO-CF (1 M) for 1 h or 4 h. 10 l of trypan blue solution (Invitrogen Life technology) were added to each dish. in vitro differentiated H2k mdx myotubes were treated with increasing concentrations of Pip6a-PMO. an EC50 value (i.e. concentration required to achieve 50% exon 23 skipping) of 41 nM was calculated when transfections were carried out in serum-free medium (-S) experiments were carried out in parallel in serum-supplemented transfection medium (+S) the presence of serum did not have any impact on Pip6a-PMO\u2019s exon-skipping activity. an even slightly lower EC50 value of 30 nM was registered. exon-skipping efficiency measured 24 h post-treatment was slightly lower in differentiated C2C12 myotubes as compared with H2k mdx myotubes. a 4 h post-treatment time point was found optimal to generate a strong fluorescence signal (Supplementary Figure S4). dose-dependent uptake with Pip6a-PMO corroborated well with exon skipping levels in both H2k mdx and C2C12 myotubes. no significant difference in exon skipping was found between H2k mdx and C2C12 myotubes at 4 h post-treatment. myoblasts and myotubes were treated in the same conditions with varying concentrations of Pip6a-PMO. a similar trend was observed in normal C2C12 myoblasts and myotubes. this difference in cellular trafficking and exon-skipping activity is not due to a higher nuclei density in myotubes. in myoblasts, Pip6a-PMO had a mostly cytoplasmic punctate distribution pattern. longer incubation periods (6 h or 8 h) as well as 4 h post-treatment time-lapse experiments (12 h) clearly demonstrated that this dotted Pip6a-PMO pattern did not change over time. a 2-fold increased uptake in myotubes and a stronger nuclear accumulation in myotubes than in myoblasts. pharmacological inhibitors of the major endocytic pathways are involved in the trafficking of Pip6a-PMO in the H2k mdx myotubes. effects of energy depletion and endocytosis inhibitors on the uptake of Pip6a-PMO (at 250 nM) in H2k mdx myotubes at 4 h post-treatment as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy (n 4) (%ES calculated as described in Figure 1). treatment with inhibitors was started 30 min before the treatment with Pip6a-PMO. caveolae-mediated endocytosis had a pronounced effect on both uptake and exon skiping activity of Pip6a-PMO. CPZ and EIPA, inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, had only negligible effects on cellular delivery and exon skiping activity. similar data were obtained in undifferentiated H2k mdx myoblasts. primary mdx and wild-type cardiomyocytes were treated with Pip6a-PMO for 4 h. intracellular distribution was analysed by fluorescence microscopy. this type of distribution pattern is similar to the one seen in undifferentiated H2k mdx. normal and mdx cardiomyocytes were treated with Pip6a-PMO at various concentrations, ranging from 125 to 1000 nM. exon 23 skipping was evaluated 24 h post-treatment. in mdx cardiomyocytes, similar effects were seen. effect of endocytosis inhibitors on pip6a-PMO uptake at 4 h post-treatment. effect of energy depletion and endocytosis inhibitors on the uptake of Pip6a-PMO (at 1000 nM) in wild-type cardiomyocytes. in vitro differentiated H2k mdx myotubes were treated with increasing concentrations of Pip6a-PMO, ranging from 15 to 500 nM. exon skipping was evaluated after 24 h treatment by nested RT-PCR. on-skipping values were derived from densitometric analysis. for each experiment, percentage of exon skipping (%ES) is calculated on the densitometric value of the 23 band related to the other bands (full length + 23 + 23 + 22) with n 4. The delivery potential of most CPP-based vectors is often negatively influenced by presence of serum proteins. exon-skipping efficiency measured 24 h post-treatment was slightly lower in differentiated C2C12 myotubes. differentiated mouse H2k mdx and C2C12 myotubes were treated with increasing Pip6a-PMO concentrations, ranging from 125\u20131000 nM. dose-dependent uptake with Pip6a-PMO corroborated well with exon skipping levels in both H2k mdx and C2C12 myotubes. no significant difference in exon skipping was found between H2k mdx and C2C12 myotubes at 4 h post-treatment. myoblasts and myotubes were treated in the same conditions with varying concentrations of Pip6a-PMO. it was more efficiently taken up by H2k mdx myotubes than by H2k mdx myoblasts (Figure 2A), in line with exon-skipping activity (Figure 1). in myoblasts, Pip6a-PMO had a mostly cytoplasmic punctate distribution pattern reminiscent of association with endocytic vesicles. longer incubation periods (6 h or 8 h) as well as 4 h post-treatment time-lapse experiments (12 h) clearly demonstrated that this dotted Pip6a-PMO pattern did not change over time. a 2-fold increased uptake in myotubes and stronger nuclear accumulation in myotubes than in myoblasts. differentiated H2k mdx myotubes were pre-treated with the inhibitors for 30 min. pharmacological inhibitors of the major endocytic pathways are involved in the trafficking of Pip6a-PMO in the H2k mdx myotubes. the experiments were carried out at 4\u00b0C under conditions where energy-dependent processes are greatly slowed down. effect of energy depletion and endocytosis inhibitors on the uptake of Pip6a-PMO (at 250 nM) in H2k mdx myotubes at 4 h post-treatment as measured by fluorescence spectroscopy. caveolae-mediated endocytosis only nystatin had a pronounced effect on both uptake and exon skiping activity of Pip6a-PMO. the involvement of caveolae-mediated endocytosis was confirmed with additional caveolae inhibitors, such as Filipin III and Genistein. CPZ and EIPA, inhibitors of clathrin-mediated endocytosis and macropinocytosis, had only neglig primary mdx and wild-type cardiomyocytes were treated with Pip6a-PMO for 4 h. intracellular distribution was analysed by fluorescence microscopy. we also confirmed limited or no signal from the cells treated with PMO. normal and mdx cardiomyocytes were treated with Pip6a-PMO at various concentrations, ranging from 125 to 1000 nM. exon 23 skipping was evaluated 24 h post-treatment. in mdx cardiomyocytes, similar effects were seen. effect of endocytosis inhibitors on pip6a-PMO uptake at 4 h post-treatment. effect of energy depletion and endocytosis inhibitors on the uptake of Pip6a-PMO (at 1000 nM) in wild-type cardiomyocytes at 4 h post-treatment. the exon-skipping activity of Pip6a-PMO in skeletal H2k mdx myotubes is remarkably efficient at low concentrations, reaching a half-maximal effect (EC50) at 41 nM. the exon-skipping activity of Pip6a-PMO in skeletal H2k mdx myotubes is much more effective in exon skipping than naked PMO. we studied the behaviour of Pip6a-PMO conjugate and naked PMO in differentiated myotubes with a DMD (i.e. H2k mdx cells) or a normal (C2C12 cells) phenotype. the uptake and intracellular distribution of Pip6a-PMO follow a similar pattern in H2k mdx and C2C12 myotubes (Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S5C) the internalization of Pip6a-PMO is significantly lower in myoblasts than in myotubes (both in H2k mdx or C2C12 cells) the intracellular trafficking of Pip6a-PMO is completely different in myoblasts, where Pip6a-PMO is mostly confined in endocytic vesicles. however, this is not due to different densities of nuclei, as equal amounts were found in myo Pip5e and Pip6a differ only by inversion of the central 5 amino acid core. no direct comparison of a Pip-PMO in cardiac muscle cells has been reported before. no significant difference was found in exon 23 skipping activity of Pip6a-PMO. the lower exon-skipping activity of Pip6a-PMO in myoblasts is not due to differences in the uptake pathway. the lower exon-skipping activity of Pip6a-PMO in myoblasts is not due to differences in the uptake pathway. pip6a-PMO uptake in cardiomyocytes occurs mainly through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. this suggests that the caveolae-mediated pathway is more favourable to promote the delivery of Pip6a-PMO to the nuclear compartment. this could explain the higher exon-skipping activity in skeletal as opposed to cardiac muscles. work in the laboratory of B.L. was partly funded by the Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS); the EU-Lifelong Learning Programme (ERASMUS Placements) supported (to S.G.)."}
