{"summary": "visitor behaviour at stalls displayed and sold animals, mainly amphibians and reptiles, to assess potential contamination risk from zoonotic pathogens. we noted initial modes of contact as \u2018direct\u2019 (handling animals) as well as \u2018indirect\u2019 (touching presumed contaminated animal-related sources) there are around 200 zoonoses3 and approximately 40 of these are associated with amphibians and reptiles. captive reptiles are routinely identified as reservoirs of infectious bacteria, for example, Salmonella,4 and all reptiles should be presumed to harbour Salmonella. significant zoonotic episodes arise from indirect contact with an animal. the presumed primary transmission route for amphibian- and reptile-borne potential pathogens is via faecal\u2013oral ingestion. the aim of this investigation was to assess public behaviour in the context of potential contamination threats at close-quarters in a probable zoonotic pathogen rich environment. each event involves a substantial number of stalls that collectively sell thousands of exotic animals directly to the public. Several hundred such events occur annually throughout Europe. a total of 813 public visitors were observed as they attended vendor stalls. 29 (3.6%) made direct contact with an animal and 222 (27.3%) made indirect contact with a presumed contaminated source. the proportion of visitors to vendors at each market making subsequent modes of contact was 18.7% hand to mouth (H1). the patterns of contact were similar between each of the larger events (Terraristika and Expoterraria); however, at the IHS Show, during the five-minute observation periods, no direct contact with animals was seen. a shorter static observation period may have been informative. a longer static observation period may have been informative. the general throughput of the public arriving at, inspecting and leaving each seller stall frequently occurred within a five-minute period. the situating of pet markets in venues often used for general public purposes constitutes a potential public health hazard that realistically may endure for days, weeks or months following the conclusion of the pet market. some bacteria, such as Salmonella, persist on surfaces in the general environment. the study involved entirely noninvasive observations of anonymous members of the public at open public events Guarantor CW Contributorship. the authors gratefully acknowledge the assistance of Katie Timmins, Elise Geissler and Lia Richter. eurogroup for wildlife and laboratory animalss acknowledges funding support from the directorate-general for the Environment of the European Commission. the comments were helpful and appreciated by reviewer Ray Greek, Julia Greig."}
