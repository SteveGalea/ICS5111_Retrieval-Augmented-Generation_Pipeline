{"summary": "aspirin-induced asthma is also known as aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) it features nasal obstruction, rhinorrhea, and acute asthma attacks with airway constriction. hypersensitivity to NSAIDs and these causative substances is known as aspirin intolerance. women are affected twice as often as males, but other factors have no influence. asthma attacks triggered by aspirin intolerance can be serious. 40% of patients receiving emergency treatment for asthma have AERD. differences between AERD and FDEIA may indicate that the type of allergy (atopic or non-atopic) is not important, or may suggest that non-atopic immune activation underlies the atopic characteristics of FDEIA. hypersensitivity to NSAIDs is known as aspirin intolerance. 5-10% of adult asthma patients and 3.6-7.8% of pediatric asthma patients have AERD. females are affected twice as often as males, but other factors such as the family history, ethnicity, or geographic region have no influence. asthma attacks triggered by aspirin intolerance can be serious. 10% of patients develop asthma attacks with exercise several hours after intake of a causative food. 10% of patients develop asthma attacks with exercise several hours after intake of a causative food, but they have no symptoms if they do not exercise. this suggests that non-atopic immune activation underlies the atopic characteristics of FDEIA. cysteinyl leukotrienes (cysLTs) were originally discovered as slow reacting substance of anaphylaxis (SRS-A), which was extracted from lung tissues of antigen-sensitized guinea pigs. cysteinyl LTs were found to constrict airway smooth muscle from these animals more potently, slowly, and continuously than histamine. target of aspirin/NSAIDs and Mechanism of AERD Aspirin is an anti-inflammatory analgesic agent that has been marketed since 1899. in the 1970s, it was found that the mechanism of action of aspirin and other acidic NSAIDs involves inhibition of PG production. in the 1990s, the molecular mechanism of aspirin was finally revealed to be irreversible acetylation of Ser-530 on COX [46], with inhibition of both CO the enzyme phospholipase A2 releases fatty acids from cell membrane phospholipids. it is metabolized into various substances, including prostaglandins (PGs), leukotrienes (LTs) and thromboxanes (TXs), thought to make a major contribution to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. specific COX-2 inhibitors were developed to avoid the side effect of gastrointestinal ulceration. it was revealed that selectivity is due to difference in tertiary protein structure between COX-1 and COX-2. cysLT inhibitors are reported to be safe and effective for AERD patients. selective COX-2 inhibitors have been reported to be safe for AERD patients [48-51], indicating the pivotal involvement of COX-1 in the mechanism of AERD. most of the research performed has been clinical because useful animal or cellular models do not exist. cell line We have tried to develop a cellular model of AERD based on inhibition PG production by NSAIDs. we choose indomethacin (3 M, Fig. 1b) as the NSAID to avoid unexpected protein acetylation by using aspirin. NSAIDs increase cysLT production by Mast Cells. 0.1 M of indomethacin slightly, but significantly increased production of LTC4 and LTE4. togo et al. reported that aspirin and salicylate increased LTC4 production. interleukin (IL)-33, a type 2 helper T (Th2) cytokine released from necrotic cells as \u201calarmin\u201d [64], was highly expressed in the lung epithelium of mPGES-1 knockout mice pretreated with mite extract. it was reported that IL-33 is produced by mast cells and that it increases the production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6 by bone marrow-derived murine mast cells. cPGES-null mice undergo perinatal death with low body weight, hypoplastic skin changes, and alveolar collapse in the lungs at 18.5 days post-coitum. cPGES-null mice seemed normal, apart from the cPGES protein level. they did not provide information about the effect of NSAIDs on cPGES knockout animals. usative substances of AERD may not strongly inhibit COX-1-dependent PG synthesis. we previously observed that the ligands of two well-known nuclear receptors, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) and, independently reduced cysLT release from stimulated RBL-2H3 mast cell line. this may suggest the possibility of a role of some unknown target(s) of NSAIDs. salicylic acid is secreted by plants in response to pathogens. salicylate receptors in plants are nonexpressors of PR gene 1 (NPR1). it is a homolog of IB in mammals and has NPR1-like proteins 3 and 4 as paralogues. treatment with indomethacin at concentration up to 3 M did not cause dose-dependent changes of cysLT production, while there was almost 90% inhibition of PGD2 production. adding aspirin (up to 5 mM) doubled LTB4 production while inhibiting PGE2 production approximately 60%. togo et al. [62] reported that aspirin and salicylate increased LTC4 production by the RBL-2H3 mast cell line and mouse bone marrow-derived mast cells. the mechanism involved calcium influx following activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2. IL-33 is produced by mast cells and increases production of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-6. it was also reported that the IL-33 receptor (ST-2) is expressed by mast cells after atopic stimulation. another class of ST-2 positive memory-type Th2 cells was recently proposed to have a role in inflammatory diseases including asthma. auranofin, a gold compound for rheumatoid arthritis, induced a COX-1-dependent increase of PGE2 production without significant induction of COX-1 protein within 4 h after inflammatory treatment of rat peritoneal macrophages. it was also reported that auranofin induces p23, a co-chaperone of heat shock protein 90 that was later identified as cPGES. phospholipase A2 [71] is the enzyme that liberates arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. aspirin and other NSAIDs are also reported to affect various mitochondrial enzyme complexes. authors suggest damage to mitochondrial respiration-related proteins may exacerbate inflammation. twenty of 36 genes have human orthologs, and some are not known to be related to pain sensation. pain sensation may be related to cough in asthma patients."}
