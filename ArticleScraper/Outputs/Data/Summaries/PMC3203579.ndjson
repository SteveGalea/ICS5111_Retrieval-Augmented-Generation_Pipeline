{"summary": "fibrillarin is a 33\u201336 kDa nucleolar protein involved in multiple aspects of RNA biogenesis. it is a major protein in the fibrillar regions of the nucleolus where early pre-rRNA processing take place (1,2) it is also found in subnuclear dynamic particles that contain distinct components involved in RNA transcription and editing. glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domain is also found in fibrillarin from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Xenopus laevis and Tetrahymena thermophila. the GAR domain is responsible for interactions with various cellular (14,15) and viral proteins (16,17) the conserved GCVYAVEF octamer is indicated with vertical lines. the positions of AtFib2 deletion mutants are indicated. the central part of the protein contains 90 amino acid residues. the infection of cells with IBV has been shown to disrupt nucleolar architecture (24) and cause arrest of the cell cycle in G2 and failure of cytokinesis (23,25,26) plant viruses are also able to recruit fibrillarin to facilitate different stages of infection including virus movement, assembly of virus-specific RNP particles and possibly to combat host defence responses. VPg of potato virus A (the genus Potyvirus) (30) and 2b silencing suppressor protein of cucumber mosaic virus (the genus Cucumovirus) (31). this suggests that interaction with fibrillarin may be a general property of various virus proteins from different taxonomic groups. fibrillarin plays an important role in various processes in normal cells and during virus infections. some reports show that fibrillarin binds directly and specifically to snoRNAs in the absence of additional factors. others suggest that this interaction requires other cofactors such as yeast Snu13p (15.5 kDa in human) expression and purification of the proteins The BL21 expression strain of Escherichia coli was transformed with the various plasmids encoding AtFib2 or its mutants. protein expression induced by 1 mM IPTG was carried out for 4 h at room temperature. urea was removed by dialysis of 0.1 ml protein sample against milli-Q purified water for 1.5 h. pGEM7-derived RNA was transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase (Fermentas T7 transcription kit K0411) and labelled with [a-32P]UTP. gels containing radiolabelled RNA were dried and exposed to a Phosphoimager (Fujifilm Fla-300) negative RNA fragments (nucleotides 1\u2013300) derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene were synthesized using T7 promoter-driven transcription from pGEM7 plasmid constructs. tRNA was supplied by Boehringer (ingelheim, Germany). mutant variants of AtFib2 (16,28) were cloned into the expression plasmid PGEX-KG (50), which was modified by the addition of a sequence encoding 6 histidines. the resulting proteins therefore contained a GST (glutathione S-transferase) tag fused to the N-terminus of AtFib2 and 6 histidines at its C-terminus. RNA and protein were mixed at various molar ratios in RNA binding buffer (20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5; 1 mM DTT; 3 mM MgCl2; 50 mM NaCl), incubated for 15 min on ice and loaded onto Tris\u2013acetate agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. the average Kd values and standard errors were determined. RNA substrates Arabidopsis thaliana snoRNA and U1 snRNA were transcribed by T7 RNA polymerase (Amersham Life Science) pGEM7-derived RNA, positive or negative RNA fragments (nucleotides 1\u2013300) derived from green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene were synthesized using T7 promoter-driven transcription from pGEM7 plasmid constructs. agarose gels containing ethidium bromide were prepared with two parallel rows of wells with a distance of 2\u20133 cm between the wells. total RNA was extracted from Nicotiana benthamiana leaves as described (54) and loaded into the first row of wells along with the molecular weight markers. agarose electrophoresis tested its ability to interact with RNAs that fibrillarin is associated with during rRNA biogenesis. the absence of partially shifted bands suggests that most of the RNAs are either coated with fibrillarin or are not bound to fibrillarin at all. EMSA of AtFib2 binding to snoRNA (A), rRNA (C) and viral RNA (E) also imply that RNA-binding by fibrillarin occurs in a co-operative manner (Figure 2B, D and F). the percentage of RNA involved in complex with the protein is plotted versus the protein concentration in the sample. the protein was incubated with [P32]-labelled U3 snoRNA in the presence of equal amount (1) or 10-fold (10) excess of the following unlabeled competitors. AtFib2 was able to bind both RNA substrates in a way similar to U3 snoRNA. the apparent Kd values were 0.13 M for U1 snRNA and 0.16 M for PGEM7 RNA. the protein:RNA molar ratios that resulted in total RNA inclusion into the complex with AtFib2 protein was 6:1 for U1 snRNA and 10:1 for pGEM-7 RNA. no No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No AtFib2R 33:1 2.5:1 0.7 0.08 2.0 0.2 700:1 350:1 2.0 0.03 2.3 0.3 AtFib2R-Ala 41:1 12:1 3.4 0.25 1.2 0.2 870:1 650:1 3.7 0.41 1.3 0.3 AtFib2R138\u2013179 58:1 5:1 1.4 0.12 1.8 0.3 900:1 the full RNA binding was observed at the protein:RNA molar ratio of 80:1 for 18S rRNA and 150:1 for 26S rRNA. the 50% of RNA binding was achieved at the protein:RNA molar ratio of 6:1 for 18S rRNA and 10:1 for 26S rRNA. several well-studied silencing suppressors (p19, p21 and HC-Pro) inhibit the intermediate step of RNA silencing via binding to siRNAs (58). some recent indications that fibrillarin may be involved in the process of suppression of gene silencing induced by viruses (30) prompted us to probe its ability to interact with siRNAs. it remains unclear why ss siRNAs show lower maximum binding than double-stranded siRNAs. it cannot be ruled out that a portion of ss siRNA molecules (20%) may have a conformation unfavourable for binding by fibrillarin. arin proteins (70% similarity) (9) allowed us to make the schematic representation of the AtFib2 molecule on the basis of a slightly modified scheme suggested by Aris and Blobel (7) for the human fibrillarin. this scheme shows the three main regions of the protein (indicated above the protein scheme) atFib2R-Ala, AtFib2R138\u2013179, AtFib2R138\u2013187 and AtFib2R188\u2013225. it was suggested previously that the conserved octamer in the R-region could provide the RNA-binding function of fibrillarin. at the same time, both the R region (AtFib2R) and the -rich region (AtFib2-rich) bound RNA in a similar manner. this effect could be partly due to the smaller size of the molecules of the mutant proteins compared to full-length fibrillarin. the apparent Kd values were 3.4 M and 3.7 M versus 0.7 M and 2 M for U3 snoRNA and TMV RNA, respectively. the full retardation ratios were 40:1 for U3 snoRNA and 870:1 for TMV RNA. the C-terminal part of the -rich region (AtFib2R188-224) did not show RNA-binding activity at all. the binding of viral RNA (TMV RNA) was similar for both AtFib2-rich and AtFib2-rich225-281. snoRNA is one of the fibrillarin-associated snoRNAs (240 nt in length; 32,33) and 18S and 26S rRNAs. interaction with \u2018non-specific\u2019 RNAs was also tested. RNA-binding data are given as EMSA images (protein:RNA molar ratios are indicated) EMSA of AtFib2 binding to snoRNA (A), rRNA (C) and viral RNA (E) increased amounts of AtFib2 were incubated in buffer for RNA binding. lane marked \u2018RNA\u2019 is the probe with no protein added. the amount of free U3 snoRNA released from complex was determined by electrophoresis. the excess of the competitors is indicated by white (1) or stroked (10) columns. the apparent Kd for U3 snoRNA binding by AtFib2 was estimated to be 0.17 M. ratiob Apparent, Kd (M) n (Hill constant) AtFib2 8:1 0.6:1 0.17 0.01 2.5 0.18 300:1 100:1 100:1 0.57 0.04 3.0 0.3 AtFib2-Ala 8:1 0.65:1 0.18 0.02 2.4 0.2 300:1 100:1 0.57 0.57 0.05 3.0 0.2 AtFib2GAR 8:1 0.6:1 0.17 0.02 2.3 0.3 300:1 100 atFib2-rich 32:1 3:1 0.8 0.06 2.0 0.3 700:1 350:1 2.0 0.18 2.5 0.2 AtFib2-rich258\u2013281 36:1 17:1 3.9 0.4 1.0 0.15 780:1 400:1 2.3 0.2 1.5 0.2 AtFib2-rich282\u2013320 no No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No No atFib2 has slightly lower affinity for viral RNAs than for rRNAs. however, the viral RNA-binding characteristics of fibrillarin were similar to those of viral movement proteins that form RNP complexes with these viral RNAs. a radiolabelled U3 snoRNA can be released from the complex with AtFib2 by TMV RNA, 18S rRNA and 26S rRNA. ss or double-stranded RNAs was bound by fibrillarin. full retardation ratio for double-stranded siRNA was 20:1. binding of AtFib2 to 300-nt long dsRNA or ssRNA fragments was not achieved. EMSA results suggest that fibrillarin binds RNA with no or little sequence or structure specificity. some RNAs show some differences in the affinity to fibrillarin. the RNA-binding activity of At2Fib mutants was analysed using U3 snoRNA (240 nt) and genomic TMV RNA (6400 nt) as substrates. Figure 4 describes the dependence of U3 snoRNA binding by the protein variants on the concentration of the protein in the sample. the substitution of the GCVYAVEF octamer with alanines had no effect on RNA binding to U3 snoRNA by the full-length AtFib2 protein. however, the deletion of any of three previously predicted domains (7) also did not lead to reduction of RNA-binding activity (Figure 4A and Table 1). both the R region (AtFib2R) and the -rich region (AtFib2-rich) bound RNA in a similar manner. the binding parameters of these mutants differed from that of the full-length protein. the apparent Kd values were 0.7\u20130.8 M for U3 snoRNA and 2 M for TMV RNA. parts of the R and -rich regions were expressed, purified and tested for RNA-binding activity. the N-terminal part of the R region upstream of the conserved octamer showed reduced RNA-binding activity. the apparent Kd for TMV RNA did not change. the C-terminal part of the -rich region (AtFib2-rich-282-320) did not show RNA-binding activity with any RNA substrate (Figure 4C and Table 1). AtFib2 possesses two RNA-binding sites in the central (138\u2013179 amino acids) and C-terminal (225\u2013281 amino acids) parts of the protein, respectively, both of which exhibit low sequence specificity of RNA-binding activity in vitro. the octamer is located in the central region comprising 138\u2013179 amino acid residues and the other in the C-terminal -helix region comprising 225\u2013281 amino acid residues. the deletion of either of the RNA-binding regions had no effect on the parameters of RNA-binding of the protein. snoRNP complex is directed to the site of methylation by sequence-specific duplex formation between guide snoRNA and pre-rRNA. Fibrillarin is the only core component of snoRNP that showed no specificity in RNA-binding (41). the tertiary structure of Rossmann-fold MTases is in agreement with the suggested dimeric nature of the MTase domain (62). the divalent cations are often essential for polynucleotide binding. these data also might reflect the existence of two independent binding sites for RNA in fibrillarin. the amino acid residues that were shown to interact with the SAM analogue in human fibrillarin are shown in purple. a homology model of AtFib2 based on the structure of human fibrillarin was built using MODELLER 9v7 with the graphic interface Easy Modeller 2.0. both of the RNA-binding sites identified in this work are spatially separated and primarily exposed on the surface of the molecule. amino acid residues of the MTase catalytic triad of AtFib2, K138/D231/K260 reside within the R- and -rich- (D231 and K260). the lack of stringent specificity in RNA binding may account for interactions of fibrillarin with a wide range of guide (snoRNAs, scaRNAs) and substrate (rRNA, snRNAs). this may suggest novel, unexpected natural functions for fibrillarin that are hijacked or affected by viruses at different stages of infection for needs of the viruses."}
