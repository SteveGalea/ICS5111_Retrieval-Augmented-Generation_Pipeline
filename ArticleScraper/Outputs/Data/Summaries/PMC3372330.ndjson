{"summary": "fetal allograft is exposed to the maternal immune system at the placenta and fetal membranes. the placenta and membranes enclose the fetus and are derived entirely from fetal tissue. fetal syncytiotrophoblast cells directly contact maternal blood for nutrient exchange. humoral immunity is essential for controlling intracellular pathogens. the bacteria become coated in antibodies, which then mediate uptake of pathogens by phagocytic cells. the humoral immune response is augmented by T-helper type II (Th2) lymphocytes. macrophages present at maternal-fetal interface release predominantly Th2-stimulating cytokines and contribute to overall dominance of humoral immunity during pregnancy. this phenomenon is often referred to as the Th1-Th2 shift of pregnancy and is thought to contribute to maternal tolerance of the fetus by suppressing antifetal cell-mediated immunity. pregnant women in malaria-endemic regions are at risk of becoming infected with Plasmodium falciparum. the increased incidence and severity of malaria may occur especially in primiparous women. parasite density is highest in nonimmune women during their first pregnancy. a cross-sectional study of 2,242 women in Brazil showed that previous pregnancy was a risk factor for serologic evidence of prior infection with toxoplasmosis. pregnant women who were seronegative for Toxoplasma were more than twice as likely as nonpregnant women to seroconvert. acute infection developed in 8.6% of pregnant women (12) influenza infections cause more severe illness and higher mortality rates for pregnant women. pregnant women with varicella pneumonia are more likely to die than nonpregnants with varicella. the mortality rate for nonpregnant women with varicella is 11% (24). emerging infectious diseases include novel pathogens that have newly emerged, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pathogens that could potentially be used as biologic weapons. pregnancy is associated with an increased smallpox case-fatality rate. unvaccinated pregnant women were 3 times more likely to die than nonpregnant women and men admitted to the hospital during the same time period. Pneumocystis jiroveci (formerly P. carinii) has long been identified as a cause of pneumonia in immunocompromised persons. a mild or asymptomatic form of Pneumocytis pneumonia occurs in immunocompetent hosts. 75\u2013100 cases of psittacosis occur each year in the united states. only 14 cases of psittacosis have been reported in pregnant women. changes in immune function during pregnancy alter a pregnant woman's susceptibility to certain infectious diseases."}
