{"summary": "MERS-CoV has claimed 77 lives (42.8%) among the 180 laboratory-confirmed cases reported to the world health organization as of 27 January 2014. most cases originated from the Middle East, but human-to-human transmission, hospital outbreaks, and family clusters have been found. the pathogenic course of MERS-CoV resembles that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), another coronavirus in lineage B of the same genus. the pathogenic course of MERS-CoV resembles that of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RIG-I-like receptors RIG-I and MDA5 are cytoplasmic sensors of virus-derived RNAs. Optimal activity of RIG-I and MDA5 also requires PACT, a cellular dsRNA-binding protein which binds to RIG-I and MDA5 to activate IFN production. binding sensor proteins RIG-I, MDA5, and PACT were examined. pIFN-Luc, provided by Takashi Fujita, contains the entire promoter region of the IFN- gene. Viral RNA was extracted from MERS-CoV-infected Calu3 cells. bCoV-HKU4-infected alimentary specimens of lesser bamboo bats. bCoV-HKU5-infected alimentary samples of japanese pipistrelle bats. the expression vector for 4a proteins was based on pCAGGS. the same vector has successfully been used to express other coronaviral proteins (35, 41, 42) poly(IC)-coated agarose was incubated for 4 h with cell lysates. binding buffer contained 1 mM EDTA, 100 mM NaCl, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 1% NP-40, and protease inhibitors. RNA (1 g) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers. pIFN-Luc contains the entire promoter region of the IFN- gene. the expression of firefly luciferase is driven by three tandem IRF3-binding sites derived from the human IFN- promoter (29, 38). the expression vector for 4a proteins was based on pCAGGS. the same vector has successfully been used to express other coronaviral proteins. the dsm mutant was verified by DNA sequencing of the entire coding region. the poly(IC) pulldown assay, dual-luciferase assay, quantitative reverse transcription-PCR, and coimmunoprecipitation were carried out as previously described. RNA (1 g) was reverse transcribed into cDNA using random hexamers. RESULTS MERS-CoV 4a protein is a dsRNA-binding protein. MERS-CoV 4a protein is a dsRNA-binding protein. the alignment was generated with the ClustalW program. the most conservative residues mutated in the dsm mutant are identified with arrows. a substantial amount of PACT in the cell lysate was found to be bound to poly(IC) but not to poly(C) the resulting dsRNA-binding-defective mutant was no longer capable of binding to poly(IC) transcription in cultured HEK293T cells suppressed poly(IC)-induced activation of IFN- expression in a dose-dependent manner. similar results were obtained with a luciferase reporter construct driven by the human IFN- promoter. cells were harvested at 12 h postinfection. expression of IFN- mRNA was normalized to that of pTK-RLuc (B, D, and F) expression of 4a protein in selected groups was verified by Western blotting. the suppressive effect of MERS-CoV 4a protein was not cell type specific. this suggests that the suppressive effect of MERS-CoV 4a protein was not cell type specific. dsRNA binding influenced the IFN- promoter activity activated by poly(IC) or Sendai virus. dsRNA binding was specific to MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU5 4a proteins. ERS-CoV 4a protein stimulated IFN- promoter activity using RIG-I, MDA5 and three downstream effector proteins, MAVS, TBK1 and IRF3. if MERS-CoV 4a protein fails to suppress its activity, it should affect an upstream inducer. if MERS-CoV 4a protein fails to suppress its activity, it should affect an upstream inducer. ator plasmid was transfected into HEK293T cells grown in 12-well plates. no statistically significant difference was found between the tested groups. results are representative of those from three independent transfections. dsm is the K63A/K67A mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein defective in dsRNA binding. dsm is the K63A/K67A mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein. data are presented as fold activation and means SDs derived from triplicate groups in one transfection. differences between bars 4 and 7 in panel A (P = 0.00032), between bars 4 and 6 in panel B (P = 0.00052), between bars 4 and 7 in panel C (P = 0.00041), as well as between bars 4 and 6 in panel D (P = 0.00041) were statistically not significant (n.s.) dsRNA-binding-defective mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein, nor bCoV-HKU4 4a protein were capable of interacting with PACT. coimmunoprecipitation was carried out at 48 h posttransfection with 0.5 g of mouse anti-FLAG or anti-V5 (-V5). the amount of MERS-CoV 4a protein detected in the PACT precipitate was diminished when 1 U of RNase A was added. MERS-CoV 4a protein completely disappeared from the PACT precipitate when the dose of RNase A was increased to 5 U. dsRNA was effectively degraded by 1 U of RNase A in our experimental setting. a single dsRNA-binding domain, as defined by Pfam, was found in 4a protein. the 4a protein has 109 amino acid residues, and the dsRNA-binding domain is in residues 3 to 83. dsm, 4a protein mutant in which the dsRNA-binding domain is disrupted by replacing K63 and K67 with A; pC, poly(C); pIC, poly(IC). cellular dsRNA-binding protein PACT was included as a positive control. the 4a proteins of MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU5 but not the 4a protein of bCoV-HKU5 are dsRNA-binding proteins. the dsRNA-binding activity of MERS-CoV 4a protein prompted us to examine whether it might perturb the sensing of dsRNA by the innate immune system. at 24 h posttransfection, cells were transfected with 1 g/ml of poly(IC) samples were collected after an additional 12 h. similar results were also obtained from HeLa cells. results are representative of those from three independent transfections. we assessed the impact of MERS-CoV 4a protein on the induction of IFN- by Sendai virus. 4a proteins of MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU5 significantly mitigated the poly(IC)- and Sendai virus-induced activation of the IFN- promoter. however, neither the dsm mutant of MERS-CoV nor the bCoV-HKU4 4a protein defective in dsRNA binding influenced the IFN- promoter activity activated by poly(IC) or sendai virus. results are representative of those from three independent transfections. MERS-CoV 4a protein has recently been shown to antagonize the function of MDA5. MERS-CoV 4a protein does not affect IFN production induced by RIG-I (A), MDA5 (B), MAVS (C), TBK1 (D) or IRF3 (E) the same trend of inhibition was observed for MERS-CoV and bCoV-HKU5 4a proteins. neither the dsm mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein nor bCoV-HKU4 4a protein was capable of suppressing PACT. similar results were obtained when we repeated experiments using a reporter construct driven by IRF3-binding enhancer elements. HEK293T cells grown in 12-well plates were transfected with pIFN-Luc or the pIRF3-Luc reporter. dsm is the K63A/K67A mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein defective in dsRNA binding. dsRNA-dependent association of MERS-CoV 4a protein with PACT. bCoV-HKU5 4a protein migrated more slowly in the SDS-polyacrylamide gel. dsRNA-binding mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein was not capable of interacting with PACT. dsRNA of about 1 kb was in vitro transcribed and annealed. it was then incubated with 1 U RNase A for 15 min. coimmunoprecipitation experiments were repeated in presence of RNase A. a closely related 4a protein encoded by bCoV-HKU4 had no IFN-antagonizing activity. this effect was highly specific, as a closely related 4a protein encoded by bCoV-HKU4 had no IFN-antagonizing activity. this is generally consistent with two recent reports on IFN antagonism of MERS-CoV 4a protein. bCoV-HKU4 4a protein and the dsm mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein were unable to suppress IFN production. the binding of VP35 and Us11 to PACT impedes the interaction of PACT with RIG-I and MDA5. the interaction between bCoV-HKU4 4a protein and dsm point mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein was mediated by dsRNA. both bCoV-HKU4 4a protein and the dsm point mutant of MERS-CoV 4a protein were defective in dsRNA binding. analysis of dsRNA-bound MERS-CoV 4a protein and MERS-CoV 4a protein-PACT complex bound to dsRNA might shed new mechanistic light on some of the issues mentioned above. one recent report suggests that MERS-CoV 4a protein antagonizes IFN production by targeting MDA5. the differences in the analysis of MDA5 activity remain to be determined. it will be of great interest to see whether and how 4a protein might counteract PACT, RIG-I, and MDA5 in MERS-CoV-infected Calu3 and THP-1 cells. bCoV-HKU4 4a protein did not bind to poly(IC) or PACT. it remains to be understood whether bCoV-HKU5 and MERS-CoV 4a proteins lost the ability to bind dsRNA and suppress PACT during evolution."}
