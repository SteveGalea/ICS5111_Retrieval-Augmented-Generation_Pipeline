{"summary": "the 2014\u20132016 epidemic has caused the death of more than 11 000 of the people infected by the virus. many more fell ill or died as a consequence of the disruption of health services in the most affected countries. on 11 august 2014, the director general of the WHO convened a panel of experts to consider the pressing ethical questions raised by the existence of potentially effective but untested biomedical interventions. questions put to the WHO panel represented predictable but unresolved challenges to established ethical and regulatory norms of clinical research. some ethicists expressed serious criticisms about procedural issues, such as the process of the meeting, the scientific legitimacy of the panellists9 or the legitimacy of international ethical guidance in general. defining boundaries of \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 would be imperceptive to oppose the \u2018individualistic\u2019 perspective of medical care against more encompassing public health interests. the exact definition of \u2018exceptional circumstances\u2019 is also important to specify to what extent an Ebola epidemic departs from other, less urgent but equally catastrophic situations. the question is central to therapeutic development and challenges the current canons of clinical research ethics in several respects. the question is central to therapeutic development, and it challenges the current canons of clinical research ethics in several respects. the fda approval process for novel therapeutic agents appears more flexible than expected, relying on evidences of variable quality. the catastrophic situation created by the Ebola epidemic could justify efficacy trials with candidate drugs. a possible mapping scheme of risks/benefits is shown. acceptable combinations were considered for two situations: (i) treatment of confirmed cases or post-exposure after high risk events (shaded area) and (ii) post-exposure after low risk events (bordered area) the vertical axis shows if evidence of efficacy exists from: E1, human compassionate use; E3, in vivo, non-primate; and E5, other in vitro assays. the appraisal of preclinical data is a complex exercise, which ethically imposes the highest standards of scientific expertise. even if drugs are known for their high therapeutic index and direct harms are unlikely, the conduct of futile trials would have an opportunity cost, at the expense of more credible interventions. if the ultimate goal of clinical trials is to benefit the medical care of future patients, current patients should primarily enrol in therapeutic trials for the sake of advancing collective knowledge, and for the benefit of future generations of patients. in clinical trials the physician\u2013patient relationship should not interfere with the relationship between physician\u2013investigator and patient\u2013subject. the clustering of EVD inside households illustrates this kind of dilemma. unless dictated by scarcity, randomisation adds unnecessary burdens to the management of EVD patients, and additional risks of nosocomial accidents. collective equipoise is more important than the individual preferences of attending clinicians. a clinical trial is justified when there exists 'an honest, professional disagreement among expert clinicians about the preferred treatment' scientists have piloted methodological innovations departing from conventional trial designs. the first idea is to look exclusively for large size effects. adapted trial designs allow for accruing information to be taken into account. 'emergency','special' or'restricted' access programmes exist in several countries to regulate off trial use of unregistered interventions. 'emergency','special' or'restricted' access programmes are generally bound to the legal obligation to collect data on adverse events. the use of unregistered and experimental intervention' (MEURI) is meant to represent an exceptional decision about distinct individuals. a misinterpretation would be to recruit in a systematic way serial cases under MEURI protocols to circumvent, for example, too conservative or unfit regulatory restrictions. the complex issues examined in this essay illustrate how the Ebola epidemic has stripped conventional research ethics from its veil of comfort. the current convention of phased clinical trials needs to be adjusted to actual risks, benefits, evidences and emergency circumstances. a minority of scientists have argued that, in the face of a highly lethal disease such as EVD, anything plausibly efficacious should be tested by clinicians."}
