{"summary": "attitudes toward suicide among medical staff members have been associated with appropriate therapeutic responses to suicidal individuals. the aim of this study was to examine the effects of parental bonding on attitudes toward suicide among medical college students in japan. negative attitudes toward suicide such as anger could affect nontherapeutic reactions to suicidal individuals. a belief that suicide is a personal right was negatively related to suicide intervention skills. no study has evaluated the association between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide among medical college students in Japan. the care dimension of the PBI reflects parental warmth and involvement in contrast to rejection and indifference. the overprotection dimension of the PBI reflects parental overprotection and control in contrast to the encouragement of autonomy. the data collection for this study was approved by the ethics committee of the Hirosaki University School of Medicine. subjects provided written informed consent before participating in the project. the data were analyzed using the PASW Statistics software program for Windows, version 18.0. Results The mean age of the subjects was 25.24.0 years old. Table 1 presents the items included in the six factor ATTS with their descriptive data. 71.9% (115/160) Common occurrence Item 14 Could kill myself out of loneliness 35.6% (57/160) 8.1% (13/160) 56.2% (90/160) Item 15 Most people have thought about suicide 43.1% (69/160) 18.1% (29/160) 38.7% (62/160) Item 17 Could talk about my suicide wish without meaning it 35.6% (57/160) 8.8% (14/160) 55.6% (89/160) Item 28 Do Item 10 Suicide is carried out after long-term consideration 30.0% (48/160) 48.1% (77/160) 21.9% (35/160) Item 22 Suicide occurs, without prior warning 13.1% (21/160) 26.9% (43/160) 60.0% (96/160) Abbreviation: PBI, Parental Bond. multiple regression analysis of the ATTS sub-scales with the PBI scores. maternal care approached a statistically significant association with the right to suicide. there were no other significant relationships between parental bonding and attitudes toward suicide. 0.174 0.862 Unjustified behavior Age 0.019 0.038 0.041 0.507 0.613 Sex 0.484 0.335 0.117 1.446 0.150 Paternal Care 0.28 0.024 0.110 1.182 0.239 Protection 0.17 0.033 0.049 0.520 0.604 Maternal Care 0.18 0.026 0.062 0.689 0.492 Protection 0.01 0.032 0.002 0.025 0.980 Preventability/readiness to help Age previous studies have investigated the attitudes of medical students toward suicide. the scores for \"right to die\" and \"normality\" were higher in japanese students. the results showed that those for \"aggression\" were higher in american students. studies of parental bonding among medical staff supported our results. a low level of maternal care predicted severe depressive symptoms and partially mediated low self-esteem. early maternal attachment and neuroticism were found to heavily affect mental health during life-threatening stress."}
