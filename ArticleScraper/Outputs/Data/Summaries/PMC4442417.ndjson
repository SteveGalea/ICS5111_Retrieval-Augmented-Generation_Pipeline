{"summary": "a novel beta coronavirus was isolated from a patient with a fatal viral pneumonia in 2012. the disease is now designated Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and the causative virus is MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) so far 971 confirmed cases have been reported to the world health organization. dromedaries are recognized as a natural host of MERS-CoV. however, the modes of transmission to humans remain unclear. the apparent case fatality of MERS appears to be high. convalescent-phase human plasma is being considered for emerging infectious diseases (e.g., MERS, influenza, and Ebola) the limited number of patients surviving MERS who are fit to donate plasma has constrained its use in MERS. dromedaries in the Middle East and in parts of africa have high seroprevalence, and many of them have very high neutralizing antibody titers. a panel of sera was selected to represent a range of MERS-CoV antibody titers found in dromedaries sampled in the field. sera from Egypt (no. 1 to 6) had reciprocal antibody titers of 1:160 to 1:1,280, while sera from Australia (no. 21 and 23) were, as expected, anti-MERS-CoV antibody negative. antibody from MERS immune camels was protective if 200 l was delivered to immunocompetent mice 1 day prior to infection with 1 105 PFU MERS-CoV. serum from camel 2 could be diluted 4-fold without loss of ability to effect virus clearance by day 3 p.i. a 200-l portion of camel serum 2 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was transferred into Ad5-hDPP4-transduced 6- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice 1 day after intranasal infection with 1 105 PFU MERS-CoV. mice were monitored daily for mortality (there was none) and weight loss. decreased amounts of perivascular and peribronchial inflammatory cell infiltration, hemorrhage, and edema were apparent on histological examination of infected lungs. decreased severity of histological changes in MERS-CoV infected mice after therapeutic treatment with sera from convalescent camels. nonhuman primates and rabbits can be infected with MERS-CoV. none, except perhaps marmosets, develop severe clinical disease. a single strain of MERS-CoV is likely to be neutralized. recombinant camelid antibodies can be expressed and multimerized, which results in enhanced avidity, and humanized to reduce the risk of hypersensitivity. recombinant camelid antibodies can be expressed and multimerized, which results in enhanced avidity, and humanized to reduce the risk of hypersensitivity. serum samples were collected from dromedaries in Egypt (collected in 2013) and australia (collected in 2014) as previously described (17, 18) samples from Egypt contained antibody to MERS-CoV, while sera from Australian camels served as negative controls. if the human dipeptidyl peptidase receptor (hDPP4) is supplied exogenously, we showed previously that transduction with an adenovirus vector expressing hDPP4 sensitizes mice to subsequent challenge with the MERS-CoV strain EMC/2012 (16). six- to 10-week-old immunocompetent mice lose minimal amounts of weight and show no signs of clinical disease. however, mice lacking expression of the type 1 interferon receptor (IFNAR/ mice mice were then challenged intranasally with 1 105 PFU of MERS-CoV. a 200-l portion of camel serum 2 diluted in phosphate-buffered saline was transferred intraperitoneally into Ad5-hDPP4-transduced IFNAR/ mice 1 day after intranasal infection. mice lacking expression of the IFN-/ receptor (IFNAR/) are more susceptible to MERS-CoV than immunocompetent mice. treatment with undiluted serum accelerated the kinetics of virus clearance. mice showed less weight loss than untreated mice. nonhuman primates and rabbits can be infected with MERS-CoV, but none, except perhaps marmosets, develop severe clinical disease (19, 20) no mutations are detected in the receptor binding domain, most important site of neutralization. dromedary camel serum reduces virus titers when delivered prophylactically or therapeutically. high titers of anti-virus antibody are believed to reflect repeated infection of camels, perhaps during the birthing season. recombinant camelid antibodies can be expressed and multimerized. recombinant camelid antibodies can be expressed and multimerized. recombinant camelid antibodies can be expressed and multimerized."}
