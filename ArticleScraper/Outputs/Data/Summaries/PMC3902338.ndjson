{"summary": "the presence of PVL in S. aureus is associated with primary skin infections and necrotising pneumonia in young immunocompetent patients. the presence of PVL in S. aureus is associated with the production of PVL. bacteriological results of microscopic examination of the BAL revealed the presence of Gram-positive cocci with 105 polymorphonuclear neutrophils/mL without epithelial cells. the quantitative culture yielded a monobacterial species S. aureus at 104 cfu/mL of BAL identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility tests of this strain were obtained using the VITEK 2 system. the strain was resistant only to penicillin G and tetracycline. the detection of the upE and ORF1b regions of the coronavirus genome by RT-PCR was negative. the microscopic examination after Giemsa and Ortho Toluidin Blue staining of BAL and the culture of BAL on chromogenic medium CHROMagar and Sabouraud medium with antibiotic did not reveal any mycological element. PVL-positive S. aureus strain was associated with the ST 152, infrequently found in Europe. etiology is often considered with delay by physicians. the association of PVL-positive methicillin-resistant S. aureus and A and B influenzaviruses has been previously reported. this is the first report of a PVL-positive methicillin-susceptible S. aureus and A/H1N12009 influenzavirus coinfection."}
