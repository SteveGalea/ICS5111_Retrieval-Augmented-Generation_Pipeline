{"summary": "in total, 127,539 and 53,559 deaths from diarrhea and RV infection respectively, were reported among children younger than 5 years old in china. RV-induced acute diarrhea is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in piglets [14] Regardless of two epidemics of severe diarrhea near Lanzhou and Jinzhou in 1982 and early 1983. the first licensed RV vaccine, RotaShield, was withdrawn. there was no effective RV vaccine for pig gastroenteritis. resveratrol can inhibit duck enteritis virus replication in vitro. cells, virus and drugs MA-104 cells were purchased from the China Center for Type Culture Collection (CCTCC, GDC041) and grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, HyClone) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100U/ml penicillin, 0.1mg/ml streptomycin. the titer of the virus was expressed as 50% tissue culture infectious dose per milliliter (TCID50/ the mock infected group (MI) was orally administered 4 ml DMEM. at 4 days post-infection, all animals sacrificed following fasting for a period of 12 hours. the liver was harvested and samples (5 g) from all animals in each group were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80\u00b0C until further analysis. FITC anti-pig IgG2a (for anti-CD8), respectively. flow cytometry analysis was performed on a BD FACSCaliburTM (BD Biosciences, USA) 2.7 Statistical analysis All data were entered into Excel spreadsheet and imported into SPSS 22.0 for Windows (IBM corporation) for data analysis. all values in the tables are expressed as arithmetic means standard deviation (M SD), or mean standard error of the mean (M SEM) in the figures. the piglets were divided into five groups (six piglets for each) at 32 days, the piglets in three resveratrol-treated groups were administrated with RDS through adding into basal diet at doses of 3 (RDSL), 10 (RDSM) and 30 (RDSH) mg/kg/d. at 53 days, the piglets in four groups, including untreated with resveratrol but treated with RV group (RVC, Rotavirus Control) diarrhea index = summary of diarrhea scores animal number in the group number of days of trials 2.4 Determination of the peripheral blood T cell subsets. the concentration was diluted to 1.0 106 cells/ml with PBS. the optical densities of each index were recorded using a spectrophotometer (UV-2800A, UNICO, China) the concentrations of cytokines in serum and liver were assayed by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assay kits. no diarrhea in piglets of MI group was found. parameters RVC RDSL RDSM RDSH MI Diarrhea index 2.39 1.39 0.72 0.50 0.00 Diarrhea score 2 (number of piglets) 2dpi 4/6 2/6 1/6 0/6 0/6 3dpi 6/6 3/6 2/6 1/6 0/6 4dpi 5/6 4/6 1/6 0/6 0/6 4dpi 5/6 4 RDSL, low dose of resveratrol dry suspension group (3mg/kg/day); RDSH, high dose of resveratrol dry suspension group (10mg/kg/day); MI, mock infected group. no statistically significant difference between RDSH and the MI group on the MDA level. x activities in RDSM and RDSH groups were higher (p 0.05) than that in the RVC group. there was no significant difference between the RDSH group and the MI group. the IFN- level in the RVC group was significantly higher (p 0.05) in comparison with that in the MI group. the concentration of TNF- in the RDSH group was significantly increased (p 0.05) compared with that in the MI group. no diarrhea in piglets of MI group was found. parameters RVC RDSL RDSM RDSH MI Diarrhea index 2.39 1.39 0.72 0.50 0.00 Diarrhea score 2 (number of piglets) the results of antioxidative levels in serum and livers were shown in Fig 1. there was no statistically significant difference between the RDSH group and the MI group on the MDA level. RDSH-Px activities in RDSM and RDSH groups were higher (p 0.05) than that in the RVC group. there was no significant difference between the RDSH group and the MI group. the concentrations of IFN-, TNF-, IL-4 and IL-10 in serum were detected. the results were shown in Fig 2. The levels of IFN-, TNF-, IL-4 and IL-10 in serum were significantly higher (p 0.05) in comparison with that in the MI group. resveratrol could improve coxsackievirus-induced myocarditis in mice. it could inhibit enterovirus 71 replication through blocking IKKs/NF-B signaling pathway. previous study showed that resveratrol significantly attenuated dextran sulphate sodium-induced diarrhea in mice. RV infection increases the IFN- concentration in the RVC group. TNF-, a proinflammatory cytokine, could cause damage to the body. lower TNF- level could protect the organism from inflammatory injury. atrol supplement increased the amount of CD4+ in rat [57] and the CD4+/CD8+ ratio in chicken [58]. previous study has declared that the CD4+/CD8+ showed a strong correlation with CD8+ count, but not with CD4+ count."}
