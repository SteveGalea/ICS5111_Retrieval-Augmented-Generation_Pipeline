{"summary": "OBJECTIVE Our primary objective was to determine the utility of procalcitonin (PCT) in detection of bacterial coinfection in children 5 years admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit with a viral LRTI. the PCT threshold concentrations of 0.9, 1, 1.4, and 2 ng/mL were found to be statistically significant in determining the presence of a bacterial coinfection. an estimated 14% of viral LRTI admissions require pediatric intensive care unit level of care or mechanical ventilation. an estimated 14% of patients admitted to the PICU with a viral LRTI require an increased level of care. retrospective electronic medical record review of data between January 25, 2010 and September 28, 2015. patients were initially screened on the basis of a database of patients admitted to a critical care unit for acute bronchiolitis. inclusion criteria were a diagnosis of a viral LRTI, age 5 years, and at least 1 PCT value obtained upon presentation and/or during the acute LRTI admission. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated for each of the PCT concentrations. the utility of serial PCT values in influencing treatment decisions was also evaluated. if the opposite occurred, these cases were coded as an appropriate intervention. total cohort of 75 patients was composed of 49 males (65%) and 26 females (35%). median age was 9 months with an age range of 1 month to 4.5 years. median age was 12 months with a range of 2 months to 4.5 years. seventy-one of 75 patients (95%) tested positive for a virus. adenovirus was present in 19 of 61 patients (31%), parainfluenza type 3 in 10 of 61 patients (16%), adenovirus in 6 of 61 patients (9.8%), coronavirus in 3 of 61 patients (5%), parainfluenza 4 in 2 of 61 patients (3%), and parainfluenza 2 in 1 of 61 patients (1.6%). bacterial cultures were obtained from 71 of 75 patients (95%) and 21 of 71 patients (30%) had a positive bacterial culture. no patient had a bronchoalveolar lavage culture positive for a bacterial organism. in the single PCT group (n = 50), the median PCT value was 0.66 ng/mL (IQR, 0.19\u20130.98 ng/mL) the median PCT value for those without evidence of bacterial infection was 0.85 ng/mL (IQR, 0.17\u20132.35 ng/mL) median PCT value for those diagnosed with bacterial infection was 1.22 ng/mL (IQR, 0.55\u20134.54 ng/mL) median PCT value for those without evidence of bacterial infection was 0.69 ng/mL (IQR, 0.26\u20134.36 ng/mL). sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values of PCT in predicting the presence or absence of a bacterial coinfection were analyzed for the combined 75-Patient PCT Cohort in the utility of a second PCT value obtained within 24 hours from the first PCT value was evaluated regarding its influence on treatment decisions. a second PCT value correctly influenced treatment decisions in 44% of cases. a threshold concentration of 1.4 ng/mL showed the best utility of the PCT concentrations tested with a combined specificity of 83% and a negative predictive value of 76%. the negative predictive value for a threshold concentration of 1.4 ng/mL is similar to that reported in a recent study performed by Cies and Chopra. a study by Laham et al6 in 2014 showed a specificity of 100% in predicting bacterial infection in patients with bronchiolitis. other studies have shown high false-negative rates approaching 13% to 18%. some of the highest PCT values were observed in patients with no confirmed bacterial infection. this could be a result of the lack of a good \u201cgold standard\u201d methodology for diagnosing bacterial pneumonia. serial PCT concentrations have been recently studied in the pediatric population in regard to sepsis. they suggested that patients with confirmed viral infections demonstrated rising PCT concentrations. the trend in PCT concentrations could not accurately be used to predict the presence or absence of bacterial infection. our preliminary data indicate serial PCT measurements may help further influence correct treatment decisions. the small sample size of the serial PCT patients limits the usefulness of the data obtained from this subgroup."}
