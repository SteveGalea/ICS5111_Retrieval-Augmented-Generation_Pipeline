{"summary": "studies of the underlying causes of disease emergence may assist in forecasting or predicting future emergence of novel pathogens (8\u201311) drivers of disease emergence usually represent multidecadal temporal shifts in the underlying environmental or demographic state. analysis suggests air travel is the most significant risk for future spread (14) the emergence of Nipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic paramyxovirus lethal to humans. it first emerged in 1998 during an outbreak that caused more than 100 human deaths. the initial spillover occurred on a pig farm in which fruit trees were planted next to pigsties as a source of additional revenue. the pattern of infection in fruit bats was examined over a 5-y period. it was shown that NiV antibodies were widespread, suggesting that the virus was regularly transmitted among bats. satellite telemetry showed regular bat movement between Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia (25), suggesting the range distribution of the bat host. this case study illustrates the difficulty in testing complex hypotheses on disease emergence. it required empirical approaches at different scales, from the laboratory to the field, and multidecadal data on hypothesized drivers of emergence. the study required commitment of resources to multidisciplinary teams for several years. climate change has been hypothesized as an underlying driver of disease emergence in a number of cases, including directly transmitted pathogens (e.g., hantavirus, Ebola virus, NiV) and vector-borne or water-borne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, and cholera (12, 34\u201338). only 22.7% (76 of 335) of EID events identified from 1940 to 2006 were vector-borne, with 77.3% (259 of 335) being directly transmitted. applying climate models to directly transmitted pathogens may provide a useful strategy to predict future emergence risk. correlative ecosystem modeling (ENM) is a widely used tool to investigate potential distributions of species under scenarios of environmental change. ENM was first used to make ecological predictions of the distribution of wildlife species from occurrence data. this has been applied to some wildlife diseases (53) and is increasingly used to estimate the current distribution of human pathogens based on climate, other environmental parameters and reported human cases of infection. the identities of potential mammal reservoir hosts for Ebola and Marburg viruses in africa were deduced by intersecting mammal distributions with an ENM of the two pathogens. efforts to forecast future disease emergence should include a component that investigates the potential expansion or contraction of host species distributions.

(ii) predictive modeling of how these drivers will promote or shape future EID emergence potential and/or risk. these approaches are inherently multidisciplinary and are still in early stages of their development as disciplines."}
