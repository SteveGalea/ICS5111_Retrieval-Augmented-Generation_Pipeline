{"summary": "Licensed vaccines can be divided into viral and bacterial vaccines. a whole panel of different cell lines has been used for vaccine production processes. diploid cell lines have a finite lifespan and in these cell lines the chromosomes are paired. the first continuous cell line approved for the production of vaccines was the Vero cell line. it has been described that vero cells at passages 140 to 165 are not tumorigenic in immunocompromised mice. a major advantage of Vero cells is that the cells are sensitive to infection with many different viruses. the current repertoire of cell substrates is inadequate for the manufacture of certain types of (new) vaccines. fda.gov/downloads/AdvisoryCommittees/CommitteesMeetingMaterials/BloodVaccinesandOtherBiologics/VaccinesandRelatedBiologicalProductsAdvisoryCommittee/UCM319573.pdf. currently several tumor cells lines are being explored for their capacity to propagate viral vectors. this is most likely due to the development of techniques that can detect adventitious viruses five human tumor cell lines were selected, HL60, K562, KG1, and u937. all different cell lines originate from blood cells that were abrogated in their development at different promonocytic stages. poliovirus, as representative of Picornaviridae family, can be propagated in the human suspension cell lines. the vero cell line was taken along as a positive control cell line. CHO suspension cells were cultured in ex-cell 302 medium (Sigma) in shaker flasks (Corning) gently rotating at 50\u2013100 rpm in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. in the last infection round, 1 107 cells in a T175 flask were infected. samples were harvested at day 3 (VERO and U937) or day 6. this was repeated for 4 times to allow the virus to adapt to the new cell lines. dilutions were prepared from cellular lysates or supernatant from hematopoietic cells infected with Sabin poliovirus type 1 in serum-containing M199 medium. 50 L of these dilutions was added to 6 separate wells. the virus titer was determined by end-point titration. a mixture of a mouse monoclonal antibody and an HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody were added for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. after four washing steps, the signal reagent HighLite was added and the emitted light was detected with a luminometer. o cell line was taken along as a positive control cell line. CHO suspension cells were cultured in ex-cell 302 medium (Sigma) in shaker flasks (Corning) gently rotating at 50\u2013100 rpm at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. the susceptible tumor cell lines were infected with Sabin poliovirus type 1 from the parental virus or virus that was passaged for 5 times on the hematopoietic cell lines at MOI 1 or MOI 0.01. samples of the supernatant and cellular lysates were harvested at different time points. after centrifugation, the supernatant was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 4 minutes to remove cells floating in the medium that did not release their pro adherent Vero cells were seeded at a concentration of 1 104 cells/100 L in 96-well flat plates in M199 medium containing 10% serum. dilutions were prepared from cellular lysates or supernatant from hematopoietic cells infected with Sabin poliovirus type 1 in serum-containing M199 medium. 50 L of these dilutions was added to 6 separate wells. specific mouse monoclonal antibody and an HRP-labeled goat anti-mouse antibody were added for 30 minutes at 37\u00b0C. after four washing steps, the signal reagent HighLite was added and the emitted light was detected with a luminometer. FITC- or PE-labeled IgG1 antibodies were used as controls. replication was efficient in the control cell line Vero, grown in serum-free medium, yielding high titers of more than 1 107 CCID50/mL in all 5 passages. this is most likely due to the fact that cells were not washed after primary infection, suggesting that the virus titer is the result of virus that remained present in the culture medium, which was unable to infect the cells. titer in CCID50 value (a) or D-antigen level (c) of Sabin poliovirus type 1 per mL during serial passaging of Sabin poliovirus type 1 in hematopoietic tumor cell lines. for the first infection, cells were infected with an MOI of 1, and cells together with supernatant were harvested after 3\u20136 days. after freeze-thawing of the material, half of it was used to reinfect fresh 155, the receptor for poliovirus, on the surface of the different hematopoietic cell lines correlated with the capacity to propagate Sabin poliovirus type 1. all hematopoietic cell lines, as well as Vero cells, express CD155. vero, U937, and K562 had the highest level of expression, whereas expression level of THP-1, KG1 and HL60 cells was lower. the titers in the supernatant are comparable between the parental and the passaged viruses in vero, U937 and K562 cells. in KG1 cells the virus titer induced higher titers at days 1 and 2 after infection while the original virus needed 4 days to achieve comparable titers in the supernatant. this suggests that the virus titer in the supernatant at day 1 is slightly higher if cells are infected with the passage cells were infected with an MOI of 0.01 of passaged Sabin poliovirus type 1. supernatant and cellular lysates were harvested separately at day 4 and day 7. the total viral titer in these samples was determined at day 4. the total amount of plaque forming units in these samples was determined. the total amount of plaque forming units in these samples was determined. the mean SD from 3 independent experiments is shown. 1.2 106 cells/mL and samples of the supernatant were taken daily. the mean SD from 3 independent experiments is shown. 3.6. surface expression of CD54, CAR, and CD81. natant were harvested at day 3 (for all virus passages in Vero cells and for passages 3\u20135 on U937 cells) after infection, half of the supernatant was used for the reinfection of new cells. replication was efficient in the control cell line Vero, grown in serum-free medium, yielding high titers of more than 1 107 CCID50/mL. cells infected with virus from passages 3, 4 and 5 were harvested after 3 days of culture. in K562 cells, clear cpe was visible at day 6 after infection. the amount of virus produced after replication of the passaged virus did seem to increase after the first passage. passaged virus had a D-antigen level per virus that was slightly lower compared to replicated in vero cells. all hematopoietic cell lines, as well as Vero cells, express CD155. expression levels of CD155 thus cannot fully predict the capacity of Sabin poliovirus type 1 to replicate in these cell lines. titers in the supernatant are comparable between parental and the passaged viruses in vero, u937 and K562 cells. in KG1 cells the virus titer in the supernatant at day 1 is slightly higher if cells are infected with the passaged virus compared to control virus. titer in the supernatant was determined at different time points after infection. the total amount of plaque forming units in these samples was determined. the mean SD from 3 independent experiments is shown. the virus titer of the passaged virus at day 2 in the supernatant is comparable to the virus titer obtained 2 days after replication of Sabin poliovirus type 1 in vero cells. infection of vero, K562, KG1, or U937 at an MOI of 0.01 results in a high virus titer in the supernatant after 4 or 7 days. after infection, both cells (black) and supernatants (grey) were harvested at day 4 and day 7. the total amount of plaque forming units in these samples was determined. a large variation in the D-antigen level between the 3 experiments was observed at day 3, suggesting that not all viruses expressed D-antigen yet. however, at days 4, 5, and 6 after infection, D-antigen levels were high and comparable in all three experiments. eradication of smallpox virus, rinderpest, and the polio eradication program have helped prevent many infectious diseases. the capacity to develop vaccines that induce efficient immune responses in a short period of time is thus essential to prevent viral outbreaks or further spread of viruses. cell lines consist of tumor cells that are grown in serum-containing medium. they are currently not qualified as suitable vaccine substrates. studies can be used to gain knowledge about the interaction of cell lines with viruses. well-differentiated human blood cell lines are more susceptible to cytopathic effects of poliovirus than the less-differentiated blood cell lines. poliovirus replicated less efficiently in both K562 and U937 cells, yielding a 20-fold and a 50-fold reduced virus output. et al. compared adherent and suspension cell lines for the capacity to replicate Sabin poliovirus types 1, 2 and 3. only the CAP cell line was capable of propagating Sabin type polioviruses. PER.C6 is an immortalized human cell line capable of supporting replication of a number of viruses, like influenza virus and West Nile virus. a new combination of cell line and virus should therefore always be analyzed thoroughly, before the new cell line can be used for the production of viral vaccines. a new combination of cell line and virus should thus always be analyzed thoroughly, before the new cell line can be used for the production of viral vaccines. d Sabin poliovirus type 1 replicated more rapidly than control virus. infection of K562, KG1 and U937 resulted in high viral titers in the culture medium after 4 days."}
