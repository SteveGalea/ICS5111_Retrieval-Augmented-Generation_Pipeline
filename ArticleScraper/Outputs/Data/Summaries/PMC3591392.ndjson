{"summary": "real- or near real-time monitoring of pre-diagnostic data requires automated classification of records into syndromes\u2013syndromic surveillance. results High performance (F1-macro = 0.9995) was achieved through the use of a rule-based syndrome classifier, based on rule induction followed by manual modification during the construction phase. focus has shifted to earlier detection of pathogen introduction in human or animal populations, leading to the implementation of new techniques using data sources upstream to those typically used in traditional surveillance [2]. surveillance systems using this information target general groups of diseases, or syndromes, and are therefore often referred to as syndromic surveillance [5]. decision trees are a third type of classification algorithm recommended when results must be delivered to a broader audience, such as health workers. other machine learning algorithms used in the medical field include: Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) [14]; and Support Vector Machines (SVM) [15]. animal data have been incorporated into a few surveillance systems for human populations. the electronic surveillance system for the early notification of community-based Epidemics (ESSENCE) [22], the North Dakota Electronic Animal health Surveillance System [23] and the Multi-Hazard Threat Database (MHTD) [24] have investigated the value of animal health data as sentinels for public health. the number of unique veterinary clients currently in the laboratory database (2008 to 2012) is 326. a common case code (submission number) is given to all samples from the same herd on any given day, allowing identification of samples related to the same health event. date Sample ID* Client Sample ID Sample Type Diagnostic test

syndromes was based only on the type of diagnostic test requested, and the type of sample submitted, which allowed identification of the organ system targeted for diagnosis. an initial list of syndromic groups was compiled and then reviewed by a pathologist, a bacteriologist and a clinician. all historical data were manually classified into syndromic groups to serve as training examples for the machine learning algorithms. each submitted case could have multiple types of samples and/or multiple diagnostic tests requested. observations where test code was not associated with any mapping rule were assigned \u201cUnknown\u201d as the syndromic group at this stage in the processing. a text mining process was used to separate all words found in the fields describing the sample type (client sample ID and sample type, Table 1) in the three years of available data. the minimum size for split was set at 4, minimal leaf size 2, minimal gain 0.1, maximum depth 20, confidence 0.25, and up to 3 pre-pruning alternatives. the XML code of the models used, as well as the set of customised rules for classification, are available upon request from the first author. the number of unique veterinary clients currently in the laboratory\u2019s database (2008 to 2012) is 326. a common case code (submission number) is given to all samples from the same herd on any given day, allowing identification of samples related to the same health event. samples from the same submission are represented in the table with consecutive rows in the same shading. sample of the data available, restricted to the fields relevant for syndrome classification. the field containing Submission ID was removed to ensure confidentiality, and omitted in the Sample ID shown. a syndromic group was defined as a group of test requests that are related to diseases from the same organ system. despite the absence of clinical information, the sample description allows identification of abortion cases through keywords such as \u201cplacent. a\u201d or \u201cfetus\u201d is the only syndromic group defined based on a clinical syndrome, rather than using the three criteria listed above. all historical data were manually classified into syndromic groups to serve as training examples for the machine learning algorithms. each submitted case could have multiple types of samples and/or multiple diagnostic tests requested. a given case could be associated with multiple syndromes by virtue of clues relating to multiple organ systems found in the same submission. observations where test code was not associated with any mapping rule were assigned \u201cUnknown\u201d as the syndromic group at this stage in the processing. a text mining process was used to separate all words found in the fields describing the sample type (client sample ID and sample type, Table 1) in the three years of available data. the learner requires no parameters settings other than an indication of whether a Laplace correction should be used to prevent high influence of zero probabilities. the minimum size for split was set at 4, minimal leaf size 2, minimal gain 0.1, maximum depth 20, confidence 0.25, and up to 3 pre-pruning alternatives. three years of historical data contained 23,221 cases (samples from the same herd on a given day), consisting of a total of 218,795 individual test requests from cattle (i.e. bovine, dairy or beef animals of any age) the syndromic groups listed in Table 2 were defined based on an evaluation of these three years of historical data. the final number of \"syndromic cases\" in the historical dataset was 30,760. there were 23,221 initial herd investigations, this implies an average of 1.32 recorded syndromes per case. the distribution of syndromes per case is shown in Figure 1. specific\u201d contain a greater variety of test names, including \u201cBacterial culture\u201d (18%), \u201cHistology\u201d (27%) and \u201cNecropsy\u201d (18%). Figure 2. Percentage of test requests classified by direct mapping and automated classification. the rule induction algorithm failed to learn 3 classes, and the decision tree 11 classes. the results were based on the results of a manual review of the rules created by the RIPPER algorithm. the result was failure of the algorithm to establish good decision rules. the classifier based on Decision Trees performed reasonably well in the micro score (F1-micro score of 0.923) however the classifier failed to learn 9 classes, which are biologically relevant, despite accounting for only 2% of the unmapped instances. this type of data lacks specificity not only because it precedes diagnostic results, but also due to the limited amount of clinical information provided by veterinarians. this type of data lacks specificity not only because it precedes diagnostic results, but also due to the limited the rule-based algorithm used manually modified rules was considered the most suitable algorithm for the classification of the animal laboratory dataset at hand. it was noted that the main relationships that the rule induction had failed to capture involved: Sampling of multiple organs. the observation of samples from both organs in the same test request should be classified as \"Systemic\" the top 10 performing systems, rule-based approaches were the most successful in the textual task, which required classification based on documented information [12]. their main disadvantage is the knowledge acquisition bottleneck, in the case where rules are manually created, limiting portability and flexibility. the rule-based classifier is based on an active review of test orders and diagnostic specimens submitted. the lack of clinical information is expected to reduce the precision and recall of the system in comparison to the actual syndromes observed by the veterinarians. induced rules were manually modified during construction phase, but resulted in clear interpretability of decisions and resulting classification. implementation of similar systems making use of other sources of laboratory data should be easier facilitated as standardized languages are more widely adopted in animal health laboratories. the use of a custom rule set limits the potential for automatic revision of the classification model. further research is required to establish internal validation rules."}
