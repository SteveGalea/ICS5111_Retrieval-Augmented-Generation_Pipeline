{"summary": "disease ranges across tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world. global incidence of dengue has increased 30-fold in recent decades. 50\u2013100 million dengue infections occur each year and almost half of the world\u2019s population lives in countries where dengue is endemic. the gold nanoparticle-based immunochromatographic assay has drawn much attention as a promising tool for the development of a biosensor for early and rapid detection of the disease. the discovery of variable domain heavy-chain antibodies (VHH antibodies or nanobodies) of the Camelidae family launched a new era providing valuable ligands for diagnosis, imaging and therapy that are better than monoclonal antibodies. the aim of the present study is to screen and purify nanobodies against recombinant NS1 protein of DENV type 2 from a non-immune llama (Lama glama) library. the phage displaying peptides library can provide the information of fragments binding with the targets [23] gene was ligated into the NdeI and SalI sites of the expression vector pET-30a (+)-NS1. the plasmid pET-30a (+)-NS1 was transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) the rNS1 protein was expressed as inclusion bodies and then purified using a previously described method. a 96-well microtiter plate was coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with rNS1 antigen and malarial LDH recombinant protein. the plate was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and washed three times with PBST. conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (ZSGB-BIO, Beijing, China) diluted 110,000 was added (100 l/well) for detection and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine solution with hydrogen peroxide was used as the substrate after washing the plate three times and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 10 min in the dark. Immuno Maxisorp tubes (Fisher Scientific) were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with different concentrations (10, 5, 2.5 and 1 g/ml) of target rNS1 antigen for rounds 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. reaction was blocked with 2% BSA for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and added to the immunotubes coated with antigen. culture supernatant was added to the ELISA microplate (100 l/well) coated with rNS1 antigen (1 g/ml) and blocked with 3% BSA. bound phages were detected with HRP-conjugated anti-M13 mouse monoclonal antibody. positive clones were selected by OD492-tested clone/OD492-negative control >2.1. the lysate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 4\u00b0C for 10 min. the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) superflow sepharose column. the antibody was eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazol) monoclonal antibody and VHH antibody against DENV type 2 rNS1 developed in this study were immobilized on the nitrocellulose (NC) membrane as capture antibodies to give the test line (T line), which was the most important part of the strip. the whole assembled board was cut into 3-mm wide strips. the concentration of coating antibodies (VHH and monoclonal antibodies) gradually decreased in the second and third panning cycles (50 g/ml and 25 g/ml, respectively) the concentration of Tween20 in TBS increased from 0.1% to 0.5% in the second and third panning cycles. rNS1 gene was ligated into the NdeI and SalI sites of the expression vector pET-30a (+) (Novagen,Madison, WI) in the open reading frame and downstream of the His-tag coding sequence. the identity of the rNS1 protein was confirmed by western blot analysis. four to 5-week-old female mice were immunized subcutaneously with 100 g rNS1 emulsified with complete Freund\u2019s adjuvant. three booster doses of 50 g antigen (rNS1) emulsified with incomplete Freund\u2019s adjuvant at 10-day intervals. a booster dose of 100 g rNS1 in saline was injected intravenously every day. a positive control of anti-DENV2-rNS1 mouse monoclonal antibody was provided by Wondfo. the plate was then incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h and washed three times with PBST. the reaction was stopped by 2 M H2SO4 (50 l/well) stock was incubated at 37\u00b0C, 220 rpm until the OD600 reached 0.5. it was then amplified overnight with the addition of kanamycin (50 g/ml) and IPTG (0.1 mmol/l) at 30\u00b0C, 220 rpm. pellet was resuspended in 5 ml TE buffer after centrifugation. 96 colonies were randomly picked and cultured in 2YTAG medium. colonies were infected with 20-fold M13K07 and amplified overnight. positive clones were selected by OD492-tested clone/OD492-negative control >2.1. negative control was a blank. coli BL21 (DE3) was incubated at 37\u00b0C, 220 rpm for 4\u20135 h. cells were harvested and the pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer. the supernatant was loaded onto a superflow sepharose column. 0.3 M NaCl, 3.4 mM EDTA, 0.05% Tween) flowed for 500 s, followed by the regeneration of the three dimensional chip using 1000 l of 10 mM NaOH. colloidal gold was prepared by following a previously reported method with slight modifications. sensitivity and specificity of the two types of strips were determined by using dengue positive viral culture supernatants and clinical serum samples of different endemic diseases. phage peptide library kit displays 12-residue peptides with random sequences fused with the N terminus of the minor coat protein (pIII) of M13 phage. ELISA data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and means were compared by the Student\u2013Newman\u2013Keuls test [28]. clinical data were expressed with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as suggested by Tjitra et al. the dashed line represents denatured protein with a peak at 355 nm. solid line represents refolded protein with a peak at approximately 340 nm. the emission spectrum was recorded from 300 nm to 420 nm. 20 positive clones were selected for sequencing. sequence alignment and analysis revealed that most of the clones have sequence homology. four different strains of VHHs were analyzed for CDR and framework regions according to the IMGT unique numbering system. ant proteins were produced at high levels within a range of 5\u20138 mg/l from bacterial culture. P2 and P13 VHHs were expressed as inclusion bodies while P9 and P10 VHHs were expressed in soluble form. the KD value for the 3B3 monoclonal antibody was 2.7910\u20138 M (Table 1), which was within the range of KD values of most VHHs for their target antigens [33]\u2013[35], while P10 and P13 had lower binding affinities. both of antibodies did not display cross reaction with other His-tagged HIV-p24 recombinant proteins. dengue type 2 viral culture supernatants, non-dengue serum specimens and serum from a healthy human were used for the evaluation of VHH antibodies and monoclonal antibodies immobilized kits. different dilutions of rNS1 (75 ng/ml, 37 ng/ml, 18 ng/ml, 9 ng/ml and 4.5 ng/ml) were tested on both types of strips to determine the limit of detection. detection levels based on color of the T line were observed for dilutions 110 and 120, but the level gradually became weaker for other dilutions. the native NS1 detection level of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit was consistent with that of the commercial kit. but for the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit, the end point dilution was 1200. the specificity (95% CI) of the VHH immobilized rapid diagnostic strip was 99.50% (95% CI: 97.25% to 99.92%) with one false positive result. the monoclonal antibody immobilized strip showed a higher specificity than the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit. clonal antibody was selected for epitope mapping and compared with 3B3 MAb. phage clones were isolated by incubating the 12-mer linear random peptide library with the monoclonal antibody (3B3) and VHH antibody (P2) after three rounds of bioscreening. a total of 20 phage clones were picked. rNS1 amino acids 224\u2013232 (C-terminal region) sequences aligned with the motif 224\u2013232 of rNS1 that had the consensus motif HWxxxxxxxxW with strongly conserved histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan residues. all selected binding peptides were homologous to the 224HWPKPHTLW232 amino acid region of rNS1. expression, Purification and Refolding of rNS1 The DENV2 NS1 gene was cloned into the expression vector pET-30a (+) in the correct open reading frame. the transformed BL21 (DE3) bacterial cells expressed a high level of rNS1 protein as inclusion bodies. the inclusion bodies were dissolved in denaturation buffer and purified rNS1 protein was obtained using a HiTrap Ni2+ column. the recovery rate of recomb the dashed line represents denatured protein with a peak at 355 nm. the solid line represents refolded protein with a peak at approximately 340 nm. the emission spectrum was recorded from 300 nm to 420 nm. 20 positive clones were selected for sequencing. sequence alignment and analysis revealed that most of the clones have sequence homology. the four VHHs were analyzed for CDR and framework regions according to the IMGT unique numbering system [30] recombinant proteins were produced at high levels within a range of 5\u20138 mg/l from bacterial culture. P2 and P13 VHHs were expressed as inclusion bodies while P9 and P10 VHHs were expressed in soluble form. the KD value of the 3B3 monoclonal antibody was 2.7910\u20138 M. this was within the range of KD values of most VHHs for their target antigens [33]\u2013[35], while P10 and P13 had lower binding affinities. both of antibodies did not display cross reaction with other His-tagged HIV-p24 recombinant proteins. dengue type 2 viral culture supernatants, non-dengue serum specimens and serum from a healthy human were used for the evaluation of VHH antibodies and monoclonal antibodies immobilized kits. the test lines for every concentration of antigen in the VHH antibody immobilized strips were a little darker than those in the monoclonal antibody immobilized kits. strong detection levels based on the color of the T line were observed for dilutions 110 and 120. but the level gradually became weaker for other dilutions. the native NS1 detection level of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit was consistent with that of the commercial kit. test strip based on VHH Test strip based on MAb Sensitivity (viral culturesupernatant dilutions) Color of T line Color of T line 110 ++++ +++ 120 +++ ++ 1100 ++ + 1150 + 1200 Specificity (95% CI) (non-dengue samples) 99.50% (97.25 to 99.92) 95.24% (91.41 to 97.69) phage clones were isolated by incubating the 12-mer linear random peptide library with the monoclonal antibody (3B3) and VHH antibody (P2) after three rounds of bioscreening. the peptide sequences of the epitopes and the rNS1 protein sequence of DENV2 were aligned and their homology compared. peptide sequences for the seven different clones were similar to the sequence of rNS1 amino acids 224\u2013232 (C-terminal region) sequences aligned with the motif 224\u2013232 of rNS1 that had the consensus motif HWxxxxxxxxW with strongly conserved histidine-tryptophan-tryptophan residues. residues is substituted by proline in M5 and V5, which display the consensus motif WPxxxxxW. all of the other clones (M4, V4, V6 and V7) have a strongly conserved histidine-tryptophan pair. rNS1 is highly conserved for both kinds of antibodies with similar antigenic binding epitopes. the fast, user-friendly and cost-effective immunochromatographic assay provides opportunities for point-of-care diagnosis. the selection of well characterized antibodies is crucial for the development of biosensors based on immunoassay. the frequency of dengue infection has increased because of warmer weather conditions and frequent international travel. the sensitivity of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit was consistent with that of the commercial kit with a 1150 dilution limit for detection of native NS1 in DENV2 culture supernatant. the specificity of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit was higher (99.50%) than that of the monoclonal antibody immobilized kit (95.24%) and the commercial kit (98.04%). s were identified by biopanning of a commercially available phage display peptide library (Ph.D 12 kit) using P2 and 3B3 antibodies as targets. there was only one rNS1 epitope residue (corresponding to residues 224\u2013232), which was identical for all clones in both antibodies. a phage display technique proved to be very successful within 4 weeks. compared to hybridoma technology, this protocol requires less time and no animal immunization. selection and screening of positive VHH clones are also accurate and fast."}
