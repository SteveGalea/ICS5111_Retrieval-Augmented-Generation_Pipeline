{"summary": "participation in predisposition genetic testing to assess disease risk is increasingly common. at-risk patients vary widely in the decision to undergo testing once a test becomes available. the most potent predictor of uptake is the availability of effective and acceptable preventive and therapeutic interventions. study seeks to expand the framework for understanding coping responses to genetic testing by focusing on determinants and effects of participation in testing as a form of behavioral coping with distress. most studies of predisposition testing have concentrated heavily on two broad groups of disorders, cancer and neurological disorders. the risk of cancer, for example, evokes complex responses in the united states, ranging from fear to battle cries and solidarity. mutations in BMPR2 are only approximately 20% penetrant. mutations in this gene are also found in some apparently \"sporadic\" cases. participants were recruited in one of four ways: in person at the Pulmonary Hypertension clinic at Vanderbilt University; through written correspondence with members of one Southeastern PAH support group; or in person at the 2006 Pulmonary Hypertension conference held in Minneapolis, Minnesota. all respondents were offered $25 for their participation and provided copies of written informed consent. IES is a 15-item self-report questionnaire that has been widely used to assess levels of distress. eight IES items assess avoidance, while seven address intrusion. possible IES scores range from 0 to 35 on Intrusion, 0 to 40 on Avoidance and 0 to 75 on Total Distress. a suggested cutoff for identifying moderate-to-severe PTSD on the IES Total Distress Scale is > 26. both the IES and TFA scales have been independently validated. both the IES and TFA scales have been independently validated. from January 2006 to May 2007, 119 adults diagnosed with or at risk for developing PAH completed the first interview. from august 2007 to September 2008, attempts were made to conduct a follow-up interview. IES is a 15-item self-report questionnaire that has been widely used to assess levels of distress. possible IES scores range from 0 to 35 on Intrusion, 0 to 40 on Avoidance, and 0 to 75 on Total Distress. a cutoff for identifying moderate-to-severe PTSD on the IES Total Distress Scale is > 26. both the IES and TFA scales have been independently validated. average age 50 50 White 104 (87) 62 (89) Married 90 (76) 54 (77) Any children 98 (82) 57 (81) Some college 79 (66) 53 (77)a Income 35k 34/114 (30) 14 (21) 35\u201350k 22/114 (19) 11 (16) >50k 58/114 (51) 42 (63)a Insured 115 (97) 68 (97) a difference is statistically significant at p0.05. eighty percent (n=42) were PAH\u2013sporadic and 23% (n=16) were FPAH\u2013diagnosed. most of the respondents were female (which is not surprising since this disease disproportionately affects women), white, married, and had children. four individuals who had been tested had received their test results and two had not. by the follow-up interview, four individuals had received their test results and two had not. by the follow-up interview, four individuals had received their test results and two had not.
