{"summary": "many aspects of their health have not been studied before the emergence of the Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in 2012. the possibility of spreading known and unknown zoonotic pathogens from camels to humans or other animals represents major public health and economic concerns. influenza viruses in dromedary camels are phylogenetically related to equine influenza A viruses, suggesting possible interspecies transmission. previous studies provided limited serological evidence of circulation of all influenza types (A, B, C, and D) in several african countries. viral RNA was screened for influenza A virus RNA by one-step reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using single-step 2X QuantiFast RT-PCR Master Mix kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) Viral RNA from known influenza A isolates as well as no template controls were included in each run as positive and negative controls. Sanger Sequencing Extracted RNA from positive samples was used for one-step conventional RT-PCR using the Superscript III One-step RT-PCR High Fidelity kit. the resulting amplicons were analyzed on 1% agarose gel and bands with expected size (100 bp) were purified and sequenced using cycle sequencing on an ABI 3500 Automatic Sequencer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using infA primers and the Bigdye Termin high-quality reads with a minimum quality score of 20 on 90% of the bases and 80 bp read length from each sample were aligned to the Influenza Virus Database. reads with a minimum alignment of 85% sequence identity, an E-value of 1 10\u20135, a bit score of 35, and an alignment length of 80 nucleotides were subsequently assembled using Geneious Prime 2019.1.1 software. viral RNA was screened for influenza A virus RNA by one-step real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using single-step 2X QuantiFast RT-PCR Master Mix kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) Viral RNA from known influenza A isolates as well as no template controls were included in each run. samples with cycle thresholds (Ct) values 40 were considered positive. precautions were taken to avoid cross-contamination of samples. amplicons were analyzed on 1% agarose gel and bands with expected size (100 bp) were purified and sequenced using cycle sequencing on an ABI 3500 Automatic Sequencer. paired-end sequencing reads were filtered for quality using the fastq_quality_filter command line from the Fastx-toolkit version 0.0.13. high-quality reads with a minimum quality score of 20 on 90% of the bases and 80 bp read length from each sample were aligned to the Influenza Virus Database. these results were confirmed for 5 samples by conventional RT-PCR using the same primers used in the real-time RT-PCR targeting a conserved 100 bp fragment in the M gene of all influenza A viruses. the obtained sequences were identical for samples SPC00384, SPC00394, and SPC00401 collected from Djibouti in march 2017. male 4\u20135 Y Djibouti 27.Mar.2017 SPC00401 Influenza A/camel/Djibouti/401/2017 35.67 Male 4\u20135 Y Djibouti 27.Mar.2017 SPC00455 Influenza A/camel/Sudan/455/2017 36.26 Female 4\u20135 Y Sudan 02.Apr.2017 SPC00666 Influenza A/camel/Djibouti/666/2017 a total of 16 179 out of 38 584 598 and 16 094 out of 33 491 558 high quality reads that matched influenza A sequences were obtained from samples SPC00384 and SPC00394 respectively. the PB2 contig (134 bases) from both samples were identical and matched a fragment in the PB2 gene corresponding to the region between nucleotide 2208 to 2341 with >97% identity. the de novo assembled reads from segment 8 of SPC00394 sample resulted in 2 contigs (92 and 111 nucleotides) that matched regions corresponding to 1\u201392 and 790\u2013900 in the NS1 gene of influenza A viruses. the second contig (111 nucleotides) showed >99% identity match to 52 H1N1, 39 H1N2 and 3 H3N2 strains. s from different camels arriving from the same origin on the same day reduces the possibility of environmental contamination or simple respiratory exposure to infected humans or animals. more studies are needed to confirm whether the detected viruses in camels are a result of a natural self-sustained infection or cross-species spillover from humans or pigs. our data suggests that influenza A virus could cause a sustained infection in these animals. dromedary camels need enhanced field surveillance for influenzas viruses and other pathogens."}
