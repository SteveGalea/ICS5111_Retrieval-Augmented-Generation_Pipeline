{"summary": "Morpholino oligos are steric-blocking antisense molecules which bind to RNA and get in way of cellular processes. they do not require the activity of RNase-H, Argonaute, or other catalytic proteins for their activity. a longstanding barrier to applying Morpholino antisense techniques in adult animals has been overcome. unmodified Morpholino oligos are manufactured from ribosides. the base and the morpholine nitrogen are protected and the subunit is activated with a dimethylamino phosphoro-dichloridate. the activated subunits are added to a synthesis resin with washing, deprotection and activation steps for each activated base added. nucleic acids have a 5\u2019-methylene hydroxyl (often phosphorylated) at one end and a 3\u2019-ring hydroxyl at the other end. the morpholine nitrogen is designated as the 3\u2019 end of a Morpholino subunit and the morpholine nitrogen is designated as the 3\u2019 end. endocytosis and the barrier to entry into the cytosol/nuclear compartment Unmodified Morpholino oligo PPMOs and Vivo-Morpholinos may have an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide linked to either the 3\u2019 end or the 5\u2019 end of the Morpholino oligo. the arginines have guanidinium moieties as part of their side chains, and the presence of these guanidiniums have been shown to increase cellular uptake of conjugated materials. studies on PPMOs have shown that uptake of the oligos is by endocytosis. a fraction of endocytosed PPMOs escape from the endosome. intraperitoneal injection or intranasal administration of PPMOs to mice have inhibited viral replication. vo-Morpholinos have been shown effective in mice [27,28] and are being tested in rats, adult zebrafish and various organ explants. the scaffold that will hold the guanidinium groups is added to the morpholine nitrogen at the 3\u2019-end of a Morpholino oligo while the oligo is still bound at its 5\u2019 end to the synthesis resin. unmodified Morpholino antisense oligos have been used for research into a broad range of diseases as well as several clinical trials (AVI BioPharma, Inc.) unmodified Morpholino oligos are currently in clinical trial for treatment of DMD. nucleic acids have a 5\u2019-methylene hydroxyl (often phosphorylated) at one end and a 3\u2019-ring hydroxyl at the other end. the morpholine nitrogen is designated as the 3\u2019 end of a Morpholino subunit and the morpholine nitrogen is designated as the 3\u2019 end of a Morpholino subunit. PPMOs and Vivo-Morpholinos may have an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide linked to either the 3\u2019 end or the 5\u2019 end of the Morpholino oligo. the arginines have guanidinium moieties as part of their side chains, and the presence of these guanidiniums have been shown to increase cellular uptake of conjugated materials. PPMOs are energy-dependant and temperature-dependant process that can be prevented using endocytosis inhibitors. a fraction of endocytosed PPMOs escape from the endosome, entering the cytosol and nuclear compartment where they can block mRNA translation and modify pre-mRNA splicing. Vivo-Morpholinos have been shown effective in mice [27,28] and are being tested in rats, adult zebrafish and various organ explants. the scaffold that will hold the guanidinium groups is added to the morpholine nitrogen at the 3\u2019-end of a Morpholino oligo. work has been done on viral targets such as ribosomal entry sites [3] and cyclization sequences [30]. exotic targets have also been explored, such as binding to slippery sites to trigger ribosomal frameshifting [32] or binding to ribozymes to prevent catalytic cleavage of RNA. splice modification involves binding Morpholinos to targets on a pre-mRNA (an unspliced mRNA) to redirect the spliceosome to a new pattern of splicing. splice modification involves adding a 5\u2019 cap, splicing out introns and ligating together exons, and adding a 3\u2019 poly-A tail. the activity of splice-modifying oligos is typically assayed by RT-PCR from primers that bind on either side of the altered sequence. if the altered splice leaves downstream sequence in-frame, the RT-PCR product will appear at a different location on an electrophoretic gel. if the altered splice leaves downstream sequence in-frame, the RT-PCR product will appear at a different location. resulting short double-stranded RNA is loaded onto a protein complex called the RNA-induced silencing complex. a protein in the Argonaute family binds to one strand, called the guide strand, and cleaves the other strand. the cleaved strand dissociates and diffuses away, leaving an active miRNA-RISC complex. a small subunit of a ribosome binds to the 5\u2019 cap of an mRNA and forms an initiation complex. the initiation complex moves along the 5\u2019 untranslated region (UTR) of the mRNA until a start codon is reached. these Morpholinos block the journey of the ribosomal initiation complex from the 5\u2019-cap to the start codon. Morpholinos are bound to mostly-intronic targets at the boundaries between exons and introns. these targets prevent the binding of molecules that direct the spliceosome to splice sites. splice modification may produce an mRNA that is expressed as an altered protein. splice site can result in an RT-PCR fragment of unexpected size. nonsense-mediated decay of the modified RNA causes nonsense-mediated decay. miRNA is a short strand of RNA bound to a protein complex. Morpholinos can bind to the miRNA guide strand on RISC, preventing the guide strand from recognizing its targets on mRNAs. a typical strategy is to design a 25-base Morpholino to bind the entire guide strand sequence (around 21 bases) and slightly into the loop sequence. a procedure for solution-phase conjugation of Morpholino antisense oligos to arginine-rich peptides has been published [21]. the literature of PPMO therapeutic applications has been reviewed recently. the cell-penetrating peptide (RXRRBR)2XB- was effective at correcting IVS2-654 splicing in heart, diaphragm and quadriceps. it did not cause toxicity at 12 mg/kg daily for four days. this PPMO modified splicing in smooth muscles of the gut.

PPMO with the RXRRBR2XB- peptide on a Morpholino targeting dystrophin exon 23 in the mdx mouse was compared with an unmodified Morpholino of the same sequence. PPMO induced strong dystrophin expression in 85% of the fibers of the TA while the Morpholino induced dystrophin expression in 14% of TA fibers. 72% of dystrophin mRNA lacking exon 23 and strong dystrophin protein expression comparable to normal heart. no damage to kidney or liver was detected by histological exams after PPMO treatment. no overt signs of tissue damage were revealed in haematoxylin and eosin stained tissues. levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) did not change with PPMO treatment. no significant liver or kidney toxicity were detected in PPMO-treated mice compared to saline-treated mice by standard biochemical tests. no significant liver or kidney toxicity were detected in PPMO-treated mice by standard biochemical tests. globin reached about 1-5% of the total hemoglobin in treated mice by day 19 [45]. the highest antiviral efficacies are achieved with pre-infection administration of the PPMO followed by a series of post-infection doses. PPMOs are far more effective in vivo. AG219 mice were treated by ip injection with daily doses of 380 g of scramble-sequence Morpholino oligo (about 19.1 mg/kg) or 240 g of scramble-sequence PPMO (about 12.1 mg/kg) for two days. the same dosing regimen was used with oligo sequences targeting Dengue virus but between the two oligo doses the mice were infected with 106 p 'CS 22mer extended life eight days on average and treatment with 5\u2019SL 22-mer extended life seven days on average. other treatments did not extend life by statistically significant periods compared to the 14 day survival of PBS-treated infected controls. PPMOs used cell-penetrating peptide moieties, including (RXR)4XB-, (RX)8B- and (RB)8B-. PPMOs were shown to have higher efficacies than PMO+ or unmodified Morpholinos against ebola virus. PPMOs have (RX)8B- peptide conjugated to Morpholinos targeting the start codon of the VP24 transcript gave 100% protection at 50 g per dose. unmodified Morpholinos did not prevent death of the mice when used in this experiment at 50 g per injection. PPMO-treated mice showed no significant weight loss compared to saline-treated mice. no significant differences were noted from histopathological examination of lung tissue. mice were compared with mice dosed similarly with unmodified Morpholinos. mixed PB1-AUG and MP-V3\u2019 PPMO caused slight but not significant decrease in viral titer compared to scramble PPMO. tests compared pre-infection treatment versus post-infection treatment. RRBR2XB- was effective at correcting IVS2-654 splicing in heart, diaphragm and quadriceps, important target muscles for duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) treatment. splice correction decreased from 100% at 2-3 weeks after treatment to 10%-40% at 12 weeks. in quadriceps, splicing was 100% corrected at 12 weeks. PPMO with (RXRRBR)2XB- peptide on 3\u2019 end [24], 12 mg/kg iv tail vein, daily for 4 d Dystrophin mRNA with exon 23 skipped Dystrophin protein concentration Heart: Heart: 70%, 1d post-treat; 30% dystrophin 2-3wk post-treat; 50%, 2wk post-treat; 15% dystrophin 7wk post-treat.

AG219 mice were treated by ip injection with daily doses of 380 g of scramble-sequence Morpholino oligo (about 19.1 mg/kg) or 240 g of scramble-sequence PPMO (about 12.1 mg/kg) for two days, followed by monitoring over 35 days. no ill effects were observed and the animals maintained their weights. treatment with a combination of 5\u2019SL 22-mer and 3\u2019CS 22mer extended life eight days on average. other treatments did not extend life by statistically significant periods compared to the 14 day survival of PBS-treated infected controls. PPMOs used cell-penetrating peptide moieties, including (RXR)4XB-, (RX)8B- and (RB)8B-. the PPMOs were shown to have higher efficacies than PMO+ or unmodified Morpholinos against ebola virus. PPMOs have (RX)8B- peptide conjugated to Morpholinos targeting the 5\u2019-terminal end of the VP24 transcript were an effective treatment as doses of 50 g or 5 g kept all treated mice alive. unmodified Morpholinos gave 15% protection at 50 g per dose. intranasal delivery to the lung tissue was shown effective using a scrambled-sequence PPMO conjugated with fluorescein. PPMO-treated mice showed no significant weight loss compared to saline-treated mice. mice were compared with mice dosed similarly with unmodified Morpholinos. mixed PB1-AUG and MP-V3\u2019 PPMO caused slight but not significant decrease in viral titer compared to scramble PPMO. study of antiviral efficacy of Morpholinos and PPMOs against dengue virus. mice were treated by ip injection with daily doses of 380 g of scramble-sequence Morpholino oligo (about 19.1 mg/kg) or 240 g of scramble-sequence PPMO (about 12.1 mg/kg) the animals increased in mass by an average of 1 g over the 35-day study. treatment with a combination of 5\u2019SL 22-mer and 3\u2019CS 22mer extended life eight days on average. other treatments did not extend life by statistically significant periods compared to the 14 day survival of PBS-treated infected controls. PPMOs were shown to have higher efficacies than PMO+ or unmodified Morpholinos against ebola virus when tested in cell-free translation systems. some unmodified Morpholino sequences blocked translation in cell-free translation systems. mice were treated twice with PPMOs having (RX)8B- peptide conjugated to Morpholinos targeting the 5\u2019-terminal end of the VP24 transcript. lethal challenges of 1000 pfu ebola virus were delivered ip and the mice were tracked for 15 days. etrating peptides were administered intranasally to balb/C mice. one oligo targeted the start site of viral polymerase subunit PB1-AUG. another targeted the 3\u2019 end of the NP virion RNA (NP-V3\u2019) mice were compared with mice dosed similarly with unmodified Morpholinos. the mixed PB1-AUG and MP-V3\u2019 PPMO caused slight but not significant decrease in viral titer compared to the scramble Morpholino. potent antisense effects were observed in a wide range of tissues in animals injected with Vivo-Morpholinos at dosages that did not produce detectable toxicity. Vivo-Morpholinos provide powerful tools for gene regulation studies in animals with an efficient synthesis designed for high-throughput production protocols. recent studies have shown that Vivo-Morpholinos achieve delivery in a wide variety of tissues in normal adult mice. no detectable delivery of unmodified Morpholino was achieved at the same dosage. oligomers do not cause antisense activity in cells. intravenous injection is the most efficient route to deliver Vivo-Morpholinos to the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles. intravenous injection is the most efficient route to deliver Vivo-Morpholinos to the muscles near the injected sites. a single intravenous injection of 6 mg/kg Vivo-Morpholinos spliced out the defect of the dystrophin gene in more than 50% of the skeletal muscle fibers of mdx mice. a single intravenous injection of 6 mg/kg Vivo-Morpholinos spliced out the defect of the dystrophin gene in more than 50% of the skeletal muscle fibers of mdx mice. unmodified Morpholino oligomers have been widely used in cell cultures and in embryos of zebrafish, frogs, tunicates, chicks and sea urchins. activity of unmodified Morpholino oligos in adult animals has been reported primarily in leaky tissues such as the damaged muscles in animal models of DMD [9,10,51]. however, the delivery efficiency is highly variable within tissues and inefficient in some tissues including the heart and Vivo-Morpholinos have shown potent antisense effects in body-wide muscles. they have been tested by local injection in a mdx mouse model. both local and systemic delivery methods have been tested in adult mice. intravenous injection is the most efficient route to deliver Vivo-Morpholinos to the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles. systemic delivery was achieved in most tissues including liver, small intestine, colon, skeletal muscles, spleen, lung, heart, skin, stomach and kidney but not brain. multiple injections of Vivo-Morpholinos did not stimulate an adaptive immune response in mice. the potent antisense effect in animals and lack of obvious toxicity at the effective dosage make Vivo-Morpholinos good research reagents for modifying gene expression."}
