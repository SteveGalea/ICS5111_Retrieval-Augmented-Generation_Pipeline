{"summary": "three adopted feral flea-infested cats became acutely anorexic, lethargic and febrile. tests for feline leukemia virus, feline immunodeficiency virus, toxoplasma gondii and feline coronavirus antibodies were negative. the owner, a veterinary technician, worked for a veterinarian who systematically pursued an infectious disease diagnosis. there was consistency in preventive healthcare (vaccines and parasiticides), diagnostic testing, and the dose and duration of azithromycin administration. case 2 was mildly anemic and had neutrophilia but was neutropenic when febrile illness reoccurred. unique sequential temperature data in case 1 documented a fluctuating febrile pattern prior to illness onset. it is possible that fleas were unknowingly introduced into the household with case 3. bartonella clarridgeiae, B henselae and bartonella koehlerae are natural reservoir hosts. a study from Switzerland found a statistical correlation between seroreactivity and stomatitis. the strains most often isolated from healthy, non-clinical cats are not the genetic strains most often found in humans with bartonellosis. the strains most often isolated from healthy, non-clinical cats are not the genetic strains most often found in humans with bartonellosis. some clinicians have abandoned serology in favor of vector-borne disease molecular diagnostic panels. both modalities are recommended for diagnosis of feline vector-borne diseases, including bartonellosis. doxycycline and orbifloxacin induced resolution of clinical abnormalities by day 5 of treatment. cats inoculated with doxycycline-infected blood remained culture positive despite treatment with 2 or 4 weeks of doxycycline. a combination of doxycycline and pradofloxacin (as used in case 2) eliminates B henselae infections. no studies have investigated antimicrobial resistance in cat and human B henselae isolates obtained from azithromycin-treated cats. combination therapy is recommended for culture or PCR confirmed cases. combination therapy is not proven to eliminate bartonella species bacteremia in cats."}
