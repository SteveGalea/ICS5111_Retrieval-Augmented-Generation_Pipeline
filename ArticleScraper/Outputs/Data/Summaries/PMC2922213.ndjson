{"summary": "a cross-sectional survey questionnaire was completed by 942 students at a university campus in Suwon, Korea, between December 1 and 8, 2009. the survey included questions regarding individual perceptions, motivating factors, and behaviors associated with hand washing. female students were more likely to practice more frequent hand washing. women also perceived the effectiveness of hand washing to be lower. a total of 4,293 cases and 3 deaths were confirmed by the end of September 2009. by the end of the month, approximately 9,000 new cases of influenza were confirmed each day. hand hygiene was considered the easiest and most effective measure [6] to prevent the spread of influenza. a cross-sectional survey model was used to assess hand-washing behaviors. subjects were recruited by convenience sampling from a public university. subjects were recruited from university residence halls and campus library during a one-week period. participants were asked if any acquaintances (e.g. family members, friends, etc.) were currently experiencing flu-like symptoms. matched questions in the questionnaire Variables Questions Answer category Daily hand washing frequency during the past month How many times per day did you wash your hands with soap during the previous month. chi-squared tests and multiple logistic regression models were used to identify factors related to the frequency of hand washing. chi-squared tests were also used to evaluate the relationship between recent hand washing frequency and recent flu-like symptoms by gender. the questionnaire was amended to ensure the validity of the questionnaire content. the questionnaire was designed to assess recent hand-washing behaviors, changes in hand-washing behaviors, information encountered regarding hand washing, perceived effectiveness of hand washing in preventing infection with H1N1 influenza, perceived severity of H1N1 influenza, and recent flu-like symptoms. recent hand washing frequency, changes in hand washing frequency, information encountered about hand washing, perceived effectiveness of hand washing, perceived illness severity, and perceived illness susceptibility. chi-squared tests were used to evaluate the relationship between recent hand washing frequency and recent flu-like symptoms by gender. a total of 942 participants were enrolled, of which 78.3% were male. male students were more likely to live in university residence halls. female students were more likely to have acquaintances with flu-like symptoms. more than 300 (31.9) 673 (91.2) 193 (94.6) Perceived effectiveness Negligible 40 (4.3) 32 (4.3) 8 (3.9) 0.006 More or less 300 (31.9) 216 (29.3) 84 (41.2) Substantial 600 (63.8) 488 (66.3) 112 (54.9) Perceived severity Mild symptoms like common cold 526 (56.1) 439 (59.7) 87 (42.9) 0.001 Substantial limitation in daily life 2 men were more likely to perceive hand washing as an effective preventive measure (P = 0.006). 56.1% of subjects believed that infection with H1N1 influenza would produce mild symptoms similar to those of the common cold. women were found to wash their hands more frequently than men. women were found to wash their hands more frequently than men. no significant relationships were identified between hand washing frequency and the following variables. 1.13-2.03 1.39 0.99-1.97 Have severe consequences 1.18 0.54-2.54 0.87 0.34-2.25 May die from it 2.32 1.46-3.67 1.77 1.00-3.12 Perceived susceptibility Very low 1 -
