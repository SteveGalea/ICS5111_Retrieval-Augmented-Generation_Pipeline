{"summary": "new cases of diarrhea may represent evolution of known pathogens or the emergence of new infectious agents. the traditional epidemiological approach to understanding infectious diseases is to place disease within the context of the epidemiological triangle. the number of farming operations in Canada has been in decline since 1941 (1). the study was designed to examine the occurrence and age distribution of neonatal diarrhea (calf scours) and other important calf-hood diseases in western Canadian beef herds that are serviced by veterinarians. the final objective was to determine if management practices were associated with neonatal and calf-hood morbidity and mortality rates. the survey questionnaire was divided into 4 parts. part 1 examined the frequency and timing of neonatal diarrhea (scours) in the herd. generalized estimating equations with logit link function and binomial distribution were used to examine a series of simple unconditional associations between management factors and measures of disease frequency. chi-square was used to look for differences between the likelihood of vaccinating cows and heifers with clostridial and scour vaccines. a stratified random sample of 122 veterinary clinics was chosen using a 2-step process. at the interprovincial level, the number of practices chosen from each province was proportional to the total number of beef cows reported by Statistics Canada (7). clinics in high density cattle regions were then invited to participate in the survey. only herds in which > 90% of the calves were born before April 1 included in the calculation of disease occurrence for calves from 1 to 3 mo of age. generalized estimating equations were used to examine the association between the start of calving date and the length of the intensive calving period and herd size. d size (total number of cows calving); time of calving (month when 10% of the calves were born); use of scours and/or clostridial vaccines; whether the vaccines were administered in the fall or spring of the year; and veterinary services usage. backwards elimination was used to establish a model with factors that were statistically significant (P 0.05) or important confounders. the average number of cows and heifers calving per herd (n = 304 herds) was 200 ( 232 SD), 14.7% of which were heifers with their 1st calf. median herd size was 136 with 25% of herds having 220 bred females. calves treated for injuryc 301 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.3% 1.8% Percent of calves treated with no specific diagnosisc 302 0.0% 0.0% 0.0% 0.4% 1.4% 5.8% Type of treatments reported Percent of calves treated with oral antibioticsc 298 0.0% 0.0% 2.0% 6.9% 18.3% Percent of calves treated with injectable antibioticsc 298 0.0% 0.0% 2.0% 6.9% 18.3% Percent of calves treated before April 1st were included in this calculation. 42 producers (14%) reported treating 10% of calves for neonatal diarrhea in 2010. the average percent of calves treated for all diseases with oral antibiotics was 5.5% ( 11.0% SD); parenteral antibiotics, 8.9% ( 17.2% SD); and oral electrolytes, 2.2% ( 5.5% SD) colostrum was commercial powders (53.2%, 165/310), dairy-derived colostrum (7.1%, 22/310), and other (1.9%, 6/310). most commonly administered injections given within the first few days of birth were supplemental selenium (42.8%, 131/306) and vitamins A and D (38.1%, 117/307). producers with > 220 pregnant dams were more likely to vaccinate for scours. there was no association between scours vaccination and proportion of calves treated for scours. producers were more likely to vaccinate their cows or heifers for clostridial diseases. herd owners who sought veterinary advice were more likely to report a higher frequency of both scours (OR: 1.86; 95% CI: 1.20 to 2.91; P = 0.01) and pneumonia (OR: 2.52; 95% CI: 1.55 to 4.11; P = 0.01) than those who did not seek advice. 62.7%, 192/306) consulted with a veterinarian for treating sick calves. nearly 50% (151/305) of producers had a veterinarian pregnancy test their cows and heifers in the fall of 2009. 60.3% (184/305) had a breeding soundness examination performed on 1 bull in the spring of 2010. small producers were 5.0 times more likely to have had a veterinarian pregnancy test their bred females in the fall of 2009. 27 surveys were returned from 5 of 8 clinics; Alberta, 161 surveys were returned from 29 of 51 clinics; and Saskatchewan, 95 surveys were returned from 22 of 42 clinics; and Manitoba, 27 surveys were returned from 6 of 16 clinics. the percentage of farms that began their intensive calving seasons in each month were as follows: December 2009, 0.3% (n = 1); January, 13.2% (n = 41); February, 23.9% (n = 74); March, 38.7% (n = 120); twins 302 0.0% 1.2% 2.3% 3.9% 6.6% Percent of calves born dead or within the first hour of birth 303 0.0% 0.8% 1.6% 2.9% 5.7% Percent of calves born alive but died within the first hour of birth 303 0.0% 0.0% 0.2% 1.1% 2.7% Percent of calves that died between 4 d and 1 mo after birtha 272 0.0% 0.0% 0.5% 1.2% 3.0% Total percent of calves that died from birth to 1 moa 272 0.0% the mean percentage of calves treated in 2010 for neonatal diarrhea was 5.5% ( 11.1% SD), pneumonia 2.7% ( 7.7% SD), navel ill 1.3% ( 2.4% SD), injury 0.4% ( 1.0% SD), and no specific diagnosis 1.3% ( 2.6% SD). the most common source of colostrum was commercial powders (53.2%, 165/310), followed by colostrum derived from the producer\u2019s own herd (44.5%, 138/310), dairy-derived colostrum (7.1%, 22/310), and other (1.9%, 6/310). the most commonly administered injections were supplemental selenium (42.8%, 131/306) and vitamins A and D (38.1%, 117/307). the most commonly used vaccines were for clostridial diseases (84.6%, 259/306); BVDV and infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (55.6%, 170/306); and \u201cother\u201d respiratory pathogens (32.0%, 98/306). a small percentage of producers (12.1%, 37/306) treated their calves with Ivomec, long-acting antibiotics, anthrax vaccines, pinkeye vaccines, parenteral vitamin A and D for scours (E. coli, rotavirus, or coronavirus) there was no difference in the proportion of producers who vaccinated their heifers (51.3%, 159/310) versus their cows (47.7%, 148/310) for clostridial diseases prior to calving. more producers administered a clostridial vaccine to their cows (37.1%, 115/310) and heifers (42.9%, 133 a veterinary clinic and 1 calf from 2.6% (n = 8) of herds were treated with IV fluids. 9.8% (30/305) of producers had a veterinarian perform a postmortem examination on 1 calf in 2010. 5.2% (n = 16) had veterinarians submit tissues or biological samples to a diagnostic laboratory. producers with large herds were 2.2 times more likely than the small herd producers to seek veterinary advice. odds of having to treat > 10% of calves at least once in the past 3 y decreased by 1.40 times (95% CI: 1.07 to 1.83; P = 0.015) for every month calving season was delayed. every additional 50 cows in herd size reduced odds of having to treat > 10% of calves for scours by 1.28 times (95% CI: 1.06 to 1.54; P = 0.015) large herds were 5 times more likely than small herds to pregnancy test. large herd producers were 3.5 times more likely to use a scour vaccine. large herds were 7 times more likely to have had a veterinarian necropsy dead calves. large herds were no more likely to have had a veterinarian submit samples to a diagnostic laboratory. the study avoided asking producers to diagnose causes of death in their calves. half of all producers reported treating at least 2.4% of their calf crop for scours. 5% treated > 17.6% of their calves for scours in at least 1 of the last 3 years. only 5.3% and 5.5% of american beef producers vaccinated their cows for rotavirus/coronavirus and E. coli, respectively (14), and these rates were essentially unchanged from 1993. a study conducted in 1988 found that E. coli and viral diarrhea vaccines did not significantly decrease the odds of high mortality due to diarrhea in calves 30 d of age. vaccinating pregnant females 124 d prior to calving provided protective antibody titers in the larger herd producers are more intensive users of herd level veterinary services than their smaller counterparts. there was no association between vaccinating for scours and the number of calves treated for this condition."}
