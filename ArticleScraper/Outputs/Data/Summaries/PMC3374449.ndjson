{"summary": "swabs and aspirates submitted to the clinical virology laboratory at Yale\u2013New Haven Hospital from December 16, 2001 to December 15, 2002. Specimens originated from the emergency department, inpatient wards, intensive care units, and the hospital-affiliated primary care outpatient clinic. RT-PCR Screening RNA from each respiratory specimen was extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) amplicon corresponds to nucleotides 15409\u201315848 of the HCoV-HKU1 replicase 1B gene. sequence was performed on an Applied Biosystems 3730 XL DNA Analyzer. RT-PCR Screening RNA from each respiratory specimen was extracted with the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) each cDNA was subsequently screened for the presence of HCoV-HKU1 by polymerase chain reaction with hotStar Taq polymerase (Qiagen) 1,048 respiratory specimens from 851 children tested positive for HCoV-HKU1. the most common clinical findings were rhinorrhea (100%), cough (67%), fever (67%) and abnormal breath sounds on auscultation (44%). patient no. (sex) Age (mo) Specimen collection date Length of hospitalization (d) Diagnosis Underlying illness Signs/symptoms Chest radiographic findings 1 (M) 4 Dec 18 1 New onset seizures RAD Rhinorrhea, cough Not obtained 2 (M) 12 Dec 20 4 Pneumonia Cystic fibrosis Fever, rhinorrhea, cough, wheezing, rhonchi, retractions, two respiratory specimens tested positive for human coronavirus HKU1. one patient (patient 1) was hospitalized for new-onset seizures. a second patient (patient 7) was hospitalized with hepatitis. no HCoV-HKU1\u2013positive isolates were detected in specimens collected in the remainder of the study period. the weekly distributions of HCoV-HKU1 isolates are shown as gray bars. the total number of samples collected by week are indicated by black bars. all HCoV-HKU1\u2013positive specimens were collected from December 2001 to February 2002, which implies a winter distribution. the study by Sloots et al. also detected HCoV-HKU1 predominantly in the winter. HCoV-HKU1 is circulating in new Haven, Connecticut, and is associated with both upper and lower respiratory tract disease and perhaps extrapulmonary disease. the genetic variability of HCoV-HKU1 is unknown. if this newly recognized pathogen is responsible for a substantial proportion of respiratory tract disease in children remains to be determined."}
