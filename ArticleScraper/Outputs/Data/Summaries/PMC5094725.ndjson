{"summary": "introduction MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was initially identified in a 60-year-old male with severe progressive fatal pneumonia in jeddah, Saudi Arabia in June 2012. as of July 24th, 2016, 1,782 patients have been confirmed with MERS-CoV infection globally with 634 fatalities. transmission between humans can occur within family or health care settings, some of these leading to hundreds of infections. the clinical features and outcomes of all patients meeting the case definition for MERS were compared. the clinical features and outcomes of those virologically confirmed to be MERS-CoV positive and negative were compared. the molecular epidemiology of a subset of these patients has been previously reported [7]. bronchoalveolar lavage was collected from patients meeting the clinical case definition of MERS. all samples were tested at the MOH laboratories. RT-PCR diagnosis was based on WHO recommendations, testing the upstream and using Orf1a for confirmation. the medical city serves as a tertiary referral centre for patients from across the kingdom. a confirmed case of MERS was defined by the Ministry of health, Saudi Arabia as a febrile patient with ARI who tested positive for MERS-CoV infection. patients meeting the clinical case definition during the same time frame who were MERS-CoV negative served as controls. the study was approved by the King Fahad Medical City Institutional Review board. forty eight of the patients were confirmed to be MERS-CoV RT-PCR positive while 111 were negative in MERS-CoV RT-PCR tests. p-value (1 vs 2) p-value (2 vs 3) n (%) n (%) n (%) Age group, in years 0.01 0.04 0.01 0\u201320 0 (0%) 1 (4%) 34 (31%) 21\u201330 3 (13%) 3 (12%) 13 (12%) 31\u201340 12 (52%) 3 (12%) 16 (14%) 41\u201350 4 (17%) 1 (4%) 9 (8%) 51\u201360 3 (13%) 5 (20%) 14 (13%) >60 1 value (1+2 vs 3) N (%) n (%) Travel history 0 (0%) 1 (5%) 14 (15%) 0.48 0.30 0.04 Exposed to a health care setting* 23 (100%) 21 (95%) 58 (62%) 0.98 0.01 0.01 Exposure duration >0.99 0.04 0.01 0-4hr 6 (26%) 5 (23%) 45 (50%) > = 5hrs 17 (74%) 17 (77%) 45 (50%) negative cases (N = 111)* p-value (1 vs 2) p-value (2 vs 3) p-value (1+2 vs 3) n (%) n (%) Sign & Symptoms Fever 20 (87%) 24 (96%) 90 (81%) 0.54 0.13 0.15 Sore throat 7 (32%) 9 (45%) 18 (21%) 0.58 0.05 0.06 Cough 14 (64%) 20 (83%) 91 (86%) 0.24 >0 3 (13%) 14 (58%) 38 (37%) 0.01 0.10 >0.99 HIV/other immune deficiency disease 0 (0%) 8 (35%) 16 (16%) 0.01 0.07 0.92 Steroid use 0 (0%) 1 (5%) 3 (3%) 0.98 >0.99 0.99 Hypertension 5 (22%) 15 (62%) 37 (37%) 0.01 0.04 0.61 Heart disease 0 (0%) 11 (46%) 31 (31%) 0.01 0.24 0.47 Asthma 4 (17%) 3 Lymphocyte 28.8 (23.9, 33.6) 21.6 (13.9, 29.3) 21.9 (19.1, 24.7) 0.16 0.93 0.29 Neutrophils 58.9 (50.5, 67.4) 69.6 (61.0, 78.3) 67.3 (63.6, 71.0) 0.09 0.60 0.49 Creatinine 70.0 (50.1, 90.0) 170.1 (78.3, 261.9) 103.1 (83.5, 122.7) 0.07 0.03 0.34 Creatine-k only 4 of 23 (17%) required ICU admission and 1 of 23 (4.35%) died. non-HCW MERS-CoV positive patients were more likely to be admitted to ICU (21 of 25; 84%) than MERS-CoV negative patients (62 of 111; 23%) (p = 0.02) factors that remained associated with a decreased risk of death were younger age and being a HCW. p-value Age (yr) 53.8 (46.7, 61.0) 39.5 (34.5, 44.5) 0.01 Age (median, range) 60 (12, 77) 36 (22, 64) 0.01 WBC (x109/L) 7.5 (6.0, 9.0) 6.3 (4.6, 7.9) 0.29 Lymphocytes (x109/L) 19.2 (14.0, 24. survival was shown to be significantly different in patients with MERS-CoV infection (taken together) in comparison with MERS-CoV negative patients (p = 0.003) survival analysis confirmed than MERS patients without co-morbidities had markedly better survival than those with diabetes (p = 0.01). log rank test group 1 vs. group 2 p = 0.003; group 2 vs group 3 p = 0.45; group 1 vs group 3 p = 0.45. survival analysis was carried out to ascertain impact of co-morbidities on survival in patients with MERS-CoV infection. 25% of patients had normal chest radiographs at initial presentation. 15% never developed an infiltrate on computerised tomography scans. this was reminiscent of the radiological presentation of SARS. the age of the HCW with MERS-CoV infection ranged between 28\u201356 years with only one of them having underlying co-morbidity. only 4 (17%) required ICU admission and one (4%) died. the overall clinical presentation and outcomes in HCW and non-HCW MERS patients is markedly different. be reliably distinguished from patients who were MERS negative by clinical, demographic or epidemiological criteria. this highlights the need for a high index of suspicion, early isolation and early laboratory testing to identify infected patients."}
