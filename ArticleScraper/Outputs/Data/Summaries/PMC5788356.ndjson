{"summary": "the Coronaviridae family comprises two subfamilies as Coronavirinae and Torovirinae. Coronavirinae can be subdivided into four groups, the alpha, beta, gamma and delta coronaviruses by phylogenetic clustering. in humans, coronaviruses (HCoV) are proved to cause respiratory tract infection, most frequently common cold, but can also cause severe respiratory illness. in 2012, a novel group 2c -coronavirus coronavirus was first identified in Saudi Arabia. it caused severe lower respiratory tract infection with high morbidity and mortality (approaching 50% in individuals over 60 years of age) known as SARS. by now, there is no anti-viral therapeutics that specifically target human coronaviruses. the study involving human participants was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of Zhongshan School of Medicine, Sun Yat-sen University. written informed consent was obtained from each participant or the guardian. among the patients, 38.45% were infants and toddlers younger than 3 years of age.

HCoV and the 6 species (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1, SARS and MERS) used real-time PCR. real-time PCR was conducted for 95\u00b0C for 5min, followed by 45 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30s, 55\u00b0C 15s, 60\u00b0C for 1min. all the real-time PCR reactions were performed on an ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA) 3 pairs of primers were designed by the Primer Premier 5.0 software to bind relatively conserved regions of S gene. the reference sequences used to design the primers included 15 representative strains from different regions of the world and years available in GenBank database. their GenBank accession numbers are: NC_005147.1, AY585229.1, AY585228.1, KF5300. PCR products for sequencing were purified by agarose gel DNA purification kit (Takara, Dalian, China), and cloned into PMD19-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China) all PCR products used for sequencing were from three independent PCR reactions. phylogenetic analysis for HCoV-OC43 The amplified S gene sequences of 15 strains of HCoV-OC43 from 2013\u20132014 in Guangzhou were comparatively analyzed with reference sequences of 33 representative HCoV-OC43 strains. these sequences were aligned by the GenBank database (including HCoV-OC43 reference sequence NC_005147, and sequences from different countries and different years) Specimens were only taken from individuals with 3 days of fever (temperature 37.5\u00b0C) and with cough, sputum, throat sore, dyspnea and/or other acute respiratory tract infection symptoms. 7974 male (61.11%) and 5074 female (38.89%) patients. male to female ratio of patients was 1.57:1. 88(5.89) 51(3.42) 45(3.01) 19(1.27) 140(9.38) 8(0.54) 74(4.96) Adults 2366 819(34.62) 46(1.94) 24(1.01) 19(0.80) 20(0.85) 61(2.58) 10(0.42) 166(7.02) Inpatient 8518 854(10.02) 409(4.80) 1276(14.98) 234(2.74) 251(2.95) 460(5.40 all the specimens were tested for human coronaviruses (HCoV) and 12 other common respiratory viruses, including influenza virus types A and B (Flu-A and Flu-B), parainfluenza 1, 2, 3 and 4 (PIV-1, 2, 3 and 4), respiratory syncytial virus A and B (RSV-A and RSV-B), human metapneumovirus (adV), human rhinovirus (HRV) and human bocavirus (HBo HCoV and the 6 species (OC43, 229E, NL63, HKU1, SARS and MERS) used real-time PCR. all the real-time PCR reactions were performed on an ABI 7500 Real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems, USA). real-time PCR primers and probes for HCoV and species screening. target gene PCR product (bp) HCoV-F1 GGTGGYTGGGAYGATATGTTACG Replicase 100bp HCoV-F2 GCTRAGCATCATGATTTCTTTTTTTTTTAGTTAGTTAGTTAGTAGACA HCoV-probe1 FAM-KRTTTGGCATAGCACGATCACA-BHQ HC 3 pairs of primers were designed by the Primer Premier 5.0 software to bind relatively conserved regions of HCoV-OC43 S gene. the reference sequences used to design the primers included 15 representative strains from different regions of the world and years available in GenBank database. the primers were synthesized by Invitrogen Co., Shanghai, China. PCR products for sequencing were purified by agarose gel DNA purification kit. cloned into PMD19-T vector (Takara, Dalian, China) all PCR products used for cloning and sequencing were from three independent PCR reactions. virological surveillance of HCoV and 7 common respiratory viruses Specimens from a total of 13048 patients were collected and analyzed over a 5-year-period from July 2010 to June 2015 in Guangzhou, south China. the surveillance results showed that 5127 (39.29%) were found positive for at least one virus and 4727 (36.22%) were infected by more than one virus. influenza virus was the most commonly detected respiratory virus. it showed its peak of detection rate in August and another lower peak in February. HBoV was mainly prevalent in spring and autumn. infection rate of pediatric patients was higher than adult patients (P0.05) except influenza virus, which tended to infect young children and mostly detected in age group 15\u201335 years. HCoV mainly infected children under 15 years old (2.81% in 0\u20133 years infants and toddlers and 2.71% in 7\u201315 years elder children) the odds of infection with HCoV resulting in severe disease (or admission) were 3.17 (95% CI 2.29\u20134.39). most of the HCoV positive patients were young children not in nursery (156 out of 294 HCoV positive cases, 53.06%) the most prevalent HCoV in Guangzhou from 2010 to 2015 was OC43. from the month distribution of total HCoV, we can see that HCoV-OC43 was mainly epidemic in winter and spring. HCoV-OC43 can be detected throughout the year, and its detection rate was relatively higher in spring (April and May), but lower in winter. the 5 year distribution of total HCoV and the detected species from 2010 to 2015 in Guangzhou was shown in Fig 4 and S1. the sample numbers and detection rate of total HCoV and detected species in each year was shown in Table 4. the infection rate dramatically increased in 2011 and from then on, kept a relatively higher prevalence. sample numbers and detection rate of total HCoV and detected species in each year during 2010\u20132015. year* Collected samples Positive samples and detection rate of total HCoV and detected species in each year during 2010\u20132015. age distribution of total HCoV and the 4 detected species was shown in Fig 5. the detection rate (%) of total human coronavirus (HCoV) and the four detected HCoV species in different age groups were shown. 91 cases (91/101, 90.20% of the co-infected patients) were double infection and 10 cases (10/101, 9.80%) were triple infection. HCoV+Flu 30 (29.70%) HCoV+RSV 23 (22.77%) HCoV+PIV 12 (11.88%) HCoV+HRV 10 (9.90%) HCoV+HMPV 7 (6.93%) HCoV+HBoV 3 (2.97%) HCoV+RSV+Flu+PIV 1 (0.99%) HCoV+RSV+HRV 2 (1.98%) HCo 15 HCoV-OC43 positive samples of 2013\u20132014 were selected for RT-PCR amplification and sequencing of S gene. Totally 2524 nt of OC43 S gene were successfully amplified and sequenced. the partial S gene sequences of 15 strains of 2013\u20132014 in Guangzhou were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KX447776. Phylogenetic analysis of 15 HCoV-OC43 strains detected in Guangzhou from 2013\u20132014 based on partial S gene sequence. tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method. HCoV was detected in 294 samples (2.25%, with median age 40 years) by real-time PCR. the monthly distributions of HCoV and 7 other common respiratory viruses tested in patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms from July, 2010 to June, 2015 were shown in Fig 1. the total infection rate of common respiratory virus in children is 46.59% (4008/8602), as compared to that of 32.91% (1463/4446) in adults. for most of the screened respiratory viruses, the infection rate of pediatric patients was higher than adult patients (P0.05) except influenza virus, which tended to infect adults and mostly detected in age group 15\u201335 years. metapneumovirus (HMPV); human rhinovirus (HRV); human bocavirus (HBoV); human coronavirus (HCoV) among the 13048 cases, 2.25% (294 cases) were detected as HCoV positive, including 192 males (2.41%) and 102 females (2.01%). no significant difference existed between detection rates of male and female. there was 1 case (22 years old female) detected as coinfected by both HKU1 and OC43. there was no evidence that co-infection resulted in more severe symptoms. the most prevalent HCoV in Guangzhou from 2010 to 2015 was OC43. the number of positive patients and the monthly detection rate of total human coronavirus (HCoV) and the four detected HCoV species were shown. the 5 year distribution of total HCoV and the detected species from 2010 to 2015 in Guangzhou was shown in Fig 4 and S1. total HCoV, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1 positive case number and detection rate of each year during 2010\u20132015. the age distribution of total HCoV and the 4 detected species was shown in Fig 5. HCoV-229E more likely infected elder children of 7\u201315 years. HCoV-NL63 more likely infected adults of 35\u201350 years. aged people of >65 years also high risk group to infect. there was no significant difference in the co-infection rates between emergency/outpatients and inpatients (P>0.05), and between male and female (P>0.05). among the 101 HCoV co-infection cases, 58 was diagnosed as lower respiratory tract infection, not statistically higher than that of HCoV single positive patients. human rhinovirus (HRV) and human bocavirus (HBoV) were screened during 2010\u20132015 in Guangzhou, china. of the 294 HCoV positive cases, 101 cases were co-detected by other common respiratory viruses, with 91 double infection cases and 10 triple infection cases. partial S gene sequences of 15 strains of 2013\u20132014 in Guangzhou were deposited in GenBank under accession numbers KX447776- KX447790. trees were constructed using the maximum-likelihood method based on sequences of partial S genes of 2524nt. the high pathogenicity of SARS- and MERS-CoV brought renewed interest and concerns in this virus family. further research on the origin of SARS- and MERS-CoV revealed the possibility of coronavirus variation and transmission from animal hosts to human beings. however, there is very limited report of HCoVs molecular epidemiology in Guangzhou. HCoV infection resulting in admission or severe disease was 3.17. the higher sensitivity of real-time PCR method may contribute to the higher detection rate of HCoV. HCoV detection rate varies in different regions and countries. similar phenomena could be found in the study of Dare RK et al [36] but there was only 2 years of data in that study. further analysis found that this trend mainly came from OC43 year distribution, and secondly, 229E distribution. in 2012 and 2014, when the detection rates of OC43 and 229E were relatively low, the infection rates of NL63 and HKU1 were high. NL63 more likely infected middle aged adults of 35\u201350 years. but HKU1 tended to infect elder people of 50\u201365 years. these epidemiological characteristics may help to understand the pathogenicity of HCoV and prevent HCoV infection. 3 strains were closer to genotype B, but the remaining 12 strains were more close to the newly defined genotype G in the phylogenetic trees (Fig 6B). Traditionally, 4 genotypes (A, B, C and D) have been identified based on the viral genome and the phylogeny of the main structural genes. totally 13048 throat/nasal swabs from patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms were screened for HCoVs by real-time RT-PCR. four HCoVs as OC43, 229E, NL63 and HKU1 were detected. the number of positive patients and the monthly detection rate (% of monthly detected cases) were shown."}
