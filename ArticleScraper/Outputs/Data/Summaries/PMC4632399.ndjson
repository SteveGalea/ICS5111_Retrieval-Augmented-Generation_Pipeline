{"summary": "the PEDV belongs to genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae. it is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus with a genome of about 28 kb. since 1995, bi-combined killed or attenuated vaccines have been used to combat PED and transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) the genomes of the classical virulent and corresponding attenuated vaccine strains, such as CV777 and DR13, have been deposited in the GenBank. virulence/attenuation phenotype data coupled with genome changes during the process of Vero cell adaptation have not yet been reported. cytopathic effect (CPE), reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) infected cells were incubated with 1:100 dilution of FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG in the dark. infected cells were inoculated with PEDV strains, YN1. cells in 12 well plates were inoculated with YN1, YN15, YN60 and YN144 at a MOI of 0.1. samples were collected at intervals of 6 h to produce one-step growth curves. all the piglets were negative for PEDV, TGEV and RV. RT was performed by using random primers and TaKaRa RNA PCR Kit (AMV) Ver.3.0 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. genome sequences of different passages were assembled using the next-generation sequencing method. Statistical analysis was performed using Origin Pro 8 (Northampton, MA, USA) and SPSS statistics 17.0 (Chicago, IL, USA) software. two-sided probability values 0.01 were considered to indicate statistical significance. YN1 Strain, Virus Titration, and Virus Growth Characteristic of YN1, YN15, YN60 and YN144 Vero cells were cultured for nearly 24 h to 80% confluence. the cells were inoculated with PEDV strains, YN1 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 and incubated with serum-free DMEM containing 8 g/mL trypsin (In piglets in different groups were orally administrated with 2 mL YN15 and 2 mL YN144 with the same titer of 106. tissues from intestinal tract were fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin wax by standard methods. gene sequences of parental YN1 strain, YN1-derived strains, the virulent DR13 strain and attenuated DR13 strain aligned by the MEGA v5.05 (K. Tamura, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, USA) the multiple nucleotide and amino acid sequence divergences were generated by Jotun Hein methods. the viral titers were about 4.2 log10, 6.8 log10, 7.2 log10, and 7.6 log10 PFU/mL for YN1, YN15, YN60 and YN144. the viral titers were about 4.2 log10, 6.8 log10, 7.2 log10, and 7.6 log10 PFU/mL at 12 hpi. piglets infected with YN15 showed watery diarrhea and significantly emaciated body. the PEDV was detected in rectal swabs of YN15 group at day 1 and 5 post inoculation by RT-PCR. the necropsies and immunohistochemical (IHC) results were observed to identify the virulence difference and infection characteristics of YN15 and YN144. the YN144 group were as normal as those in the control group (Figure 2B,C) the IHC score of tissue of YN15-infected pig was 9.25 0.75, 3.25 0.375 and 0, respectively. the clinical symptoms, necropsies and IHC assay results of the pig infection experiment showed that the YN15 is a virulent PEDV strain and YN144 is an attenuated PEDV strain. in 33 aa changes in the YN144, there were only 6 changes (21.2%, 7/33) in non-structural protein open reading frames (ORF)1a/b, which accounted for 72.6% of the genome. in structural proteins, S protein had the highest change rate, about 36.4% (12/33) - - - - - 145 G G - - - - 372 Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y Y the genome sequence homologies between cell-adapted virulent virus YN15 and its attenuated counterparts were 99.9% at nucleotide and aa level. from passage 15, all vero cell-adapted passages were consistently terminated early in ORF3 and had one aa deletion at 1197 aa of S protein. non-structural genes, NSP2, NSP4-7, NSP10, NSP12, NSP13 had no nucleotide or amino acid change. other non-structural genes, NSP1, NSP3, NSP9, NSP11 were less conserved. highly variable regions During the serial passages on the Vero cells, the genome mutations mainly occurred in the structural proteins regions. similarity plot of different passage viruses with parental strain YN1 was constructed using the two-parameter (Kimura) distance model. in ORF3, 1\u20133 aa changes in E, M and N protein (Table 3) and some nucleotide sequences\u2019 synonymous mutations are not identical. some aa changes in ORF1a/b, S, and ORF3 are not same, whereas the aa change numbers in these proteins are similar. the viral titers of YN1 and YN144 were about 4.2 log10, 6.8 log10, 7.2 log10, and 7.6 log10 PFU/mL for YN1, YN15, YN60 and YN144. the viral titers of YN60 and YN144 peaked at 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 hpi. log10 PFU/mL at 30 hpi, 6.8 log10 PFU/mL at 30 hpi, 7.2 log10 PFU/mL at 24 hpi, and 7.6 log10 PFU/mL at 18 hpi respectively. YN15, YN60 and YN144 were cell culture adapted compared to the original YN1 strain. necropsies and immunohistochemical (IHC) results were observed to identify the virulence difference and infection characteristics of YN15 and YN144. the intestines of four pigs infected with YN15 showed typically fluidic, distended, and yellow water-like content. however, pigs in the YN144 group were as normal as those in the control group (Figure 2B,C). YN144 (B) as well as control group (C) are indicated. arrows indicate positive signal of IHC assay in the intestinal tissue. the amino acid (aa) variation of non-structural and structural proteins during the serial passage (the mutated amino acids are underlined) in the other three proteins, i.e., E, M and N, there were 2 changes (Table 1). genome sequence homologies between cell-adapted virulent virus YN15 and its attenuated counterparts were 99.6% to 99.8% at nucleotide and 99.7% to 99.9% at the nucleotide level. all vero cell-adapted passages were consistently terminated early in ORF3 and had one aa deletion at 1197 aa of S protein.

Discussion Currently, PED caused by a variant strain is a severe problem for the global pig industry [9,10,11,12,13,14] the comparison of genomic sequences of passages of YN15 and YN144 could shed some light on the molecular mechanic of PEDV adaptation. the virulence evaluation experiment of YN15 and YN144 showed that the YN15 is a virulent PEDV strain and YN144 is an attenuated PEDV strain. cleotide and aa changes of YN1 were compared after 14 passages in cell culture with two isolates, ISU13-19338E and ISU13-20338. after 9 passages in cell culture, none of the nucleotide or aa changes were observed to be the same. virulence/attenuation phenotype data of different passages were not presented in their study. YN15, YN30, YN60, YN60, YN90, YN144, and YN200 were collected for sequencing. in the early passage\u2014YN15\u2014only the nucleotide sequences change of NSP11, S, ORF3 and M were noted. the variation of ORF3 during the cell culture adaptation process resulted in the virulence decrease of the PEDV. the early termination of ORF3 was more important for virus cell culture adaptation than virus attenuation. aa deletion at about 144 aa of S protein could be attenuation marker for the PEDV. fecal virus shedding could be detected but no microscopic lesions or IHC staining could be observed in early stage of infection. the YN144 is an attenuated PEDV strain which cannot cause the damage of the intestinal epithelial cells. this is because viruses are colonized in intestinal epithelial cells. the PEDV attenuation was associated with 9\u201326 aa changes in ORF1a/b and S, early termination in ORF3, 1\u20133 aa changes in E, M and N protein and some nucleotide sequences\u2019 synonymous mutations."}
