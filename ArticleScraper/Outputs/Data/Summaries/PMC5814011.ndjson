{"summary": "the major clinical symptoms of PED are severe enteritis, vomiting and watery diarrhea. the intestinal microbiota is an important barrier against invaders entering via the gastrointestinal route. many studies have shown that commensal microbiota can prevent pathogenic invasion by competing for receptors and enteric nutrients. the saliva of sows and piglets was collected in five farrowing houses of the commercial swine farm. each day, the saliva on the cotton threads was squeezed into collecting pipes to ensure that the sows and piglets could touch different cotton threads. the saliva on the cotton threads was squeezed into collecting pipes and replaced with new ones. all of the suckling piglets were slaughtered at seven days of age. the contents of their small intestines from the duodenum to the ileum were collected and stored at -20\u00b0C until analysis. the sequences used in the subsequent analysis (effective tags) were obtained by successively splicing raw sequence reads using FLASH (version 1.2.7) software [16], filtering raw tags using QIIME (version 1.7.0) software [17]. representative sequences showing 97% identity were then clustered as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UPARSE (version 7.0.1001) unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances were calculated using QIIME (version 1.7.0) software. the samples were clustered based on the unweighted or weighted UniFrac distance matrix using the unweighted Pair-Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) implemented in QIIME (version 1.7.0) the saliva of sows and piglets was collected in five farrowing houses of the commercial swine farm from the third to the eighth day after the piglets were born. each day, the saliva on the cotton threads was squeezed into collecting pipes, followed by replacement of the cotton threads with new ones. the presence of pseudorabies virus (PRV), classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and PEDV in the saliva milk samples were thawed and heated to 37\u00b0C in a water bath. the milk components, including protein, fat, total solids (TS), lactose and acidity, were then analyzed using a MilkoScan FT120 instrument. the 16S rRNA gene sequencing of the small intestine microbiota was qualified and quantified. the sequences used in the subsequent analysis (effective tags) were obtained by successively splicing raw sequence reads using FLASH (version 1.2.7) software [16]. repetitive sequences were removed from the effective tags to acquire representative sequences. representative sequences showing 97% identity were then clustered as operational taxonomic units (OTUs) using UPARSE. unweighted and weighted UniFrac distances were calculated using QIIME (version 1.7.0) [22]. the samples were clustered based on the unweighted or weighted UniFrac distance matrix using the unweighted Pair-Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) implemented in QIIME (version 1.7.0) [16] the samples were clustered based on the unweighted or weighted UniFrac distance matrix using the unweighted Pair-Group Method with Arithmetic Mean (UPGMA) implemented in QIIME. the sequences were clustered into OTUs using a closed-reference approach and the Greengenes 13.5 database at 97% similarity using QIIME. taxonomic analysis revealed that the most abundant phylum in the small intestinal microbiota of uninfected suckling piglets was Proteobacteria (49.1%) at the genus level, Escherichia (21.4%) was dominant, while the other nine genera had relatively low abundances. the numbers after the taxonomic ranks are the relative abundances of the corresponding taxa at each taxonomic rank within the total species or selected species. the area of the sector represents the relative abundance of the sample in the taxonomic ranks. the samples of the uninfected group fell into two clusters. only one sample from the infected group was located outside of these three clusters. a clustering tree of the samples was constructed. the taxonomic analysis indicated that the most abundant phylum in the small intestinal microbiota of uninfected suckling piglets was Proteobacteria (49.1%) at the genus level, Escherichia (21.4%) was dominant. abundance of Firmicutes (35.96%) was higher in infected suckling piglets than in uninfected ones (24.66%); abundance of Bacteroidetes (8.37%) was lower in infected piglets than in uninfected ones (22.78%; Fig 1). the samples of the uninfected group fell into two clusters. only one sample from the infected group was located outside of these three clusters. small intestinal microbiota of uninfected piglets was simple and dominated by Proteobacteria (49.1%) at the phylum level. diversity of microbiota confers functional redundancy, which contributes to defense against pathogens. in the intestinal microbial ecosystem, many functions of microorganisms are performed in cooperation with bacteria. however, changes in the relative abundances of prevotella, Pasteurella, Moraxella, Lactobacillus, Veillonella and Actinobacillus may result in decreases in functions associated with energy metabolism. the present findings can help identify new preventive measures for treating and controlling PEDV. the present findings can help identify new preventive measures for treating and controlling PEDV."}
