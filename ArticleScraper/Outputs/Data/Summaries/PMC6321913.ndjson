{"summary": "since 2010, highly virulent PEDV variants have emerged in swine farms in Asia, North America, and Europe. the mature PEDV virion consists of four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. the ERRS in the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coV promotes the interaction between S and M proteins in the Golgi region (16) inactivation of the ERRS in the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coV (SARS-CoV) impaired its incorporation into virus-like particles when coexpressed with the M in the cells (15). lysine residue of the TGEV KxHxx motif was replaced by methionine (YEPIEK VHVH to YEPIEM VHVH; change is in bold type and Yxx and KxHxx motifs are underlined) for IBV, the role of the Yxx motif in S protein intracellular transport is controversial. one group reported that this motif is not an endocytosis signal (11) plasmids expressing M protein or mCherry-tagged S proteins. mChy, mCherry gene; mChy, mCherry gene; A25, 25-nucleotide poly(A) tail; hepatitis D virus ribozyme; BGH, bovine growth hormone terminator. two types of Yxx motif exist in the CTs of S proteins among PEDV genotypes. classical strains (G1a) and some highly virulent Asian strains (G2a) contain a YEAF motif. highly virulent North American strains (G2b), S insertion and deletion (indel) strains (G1b) and some G2a strains harbor a YEVF motif. Virulent NA NAe (6) G1a SM-98 CRGPRLQP YEA. attenuated No KM887144 (NA) G1a CHM2013b CRGPRLQP YEA. to determine the roles of the two motifs in the intracellular sorting of S proteins, we constructed 12 plasmids bearing a wild-type S gene (of PC22A) or an S gene with different mutations in the CTs. the dispensable 197-aa region (residues 34 to 230) in domain 0 of each S protein was replaced by fluorescent protein mCherry (236 aa) we observed distinct sorting patterns among the 12 recombinant S proteins. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC) values of the S and ERGIC signals in each cell were shown in. the boxes indicate interquartile ranges in different groups. the lines in the boxes represent median values, and the whiskers show the range of a group of values excluding the outliers. fusion, a syncytium induction assay, was performed by culturing the transfected cells in medium containing trypsin. the syncytia induced by the eight mutants (10aa, YA, YA-A, 9aa, 7aa, HD, MK-P10, and MK-P10-V) contained significantly more nuclei than those induced by the two wild types (WT1 and WT2) surface S/total S fluorescent intensity ratios (AF488/mCherry) were calculated based on 50 individual cells of each sample. at 6 h after transfection with the plasmid DNA, vero cells were cultured in medium containing trypsin (10 g/ml) for an additional 6 h. GP17-bound S proteins (red) were labeled after incubation and fixation without permeabilization. a large portion of the GP17-bound S proteins (green) of WT1, WT2, MK-P10, MK-P10-V, 5aa and 5aa-A formed puncta in the cells. this was further confirmed when we compared the PCC values between the GP17-bound S protein signal and total surface S protein signal of each S protein at 24 h after transfection with the plasmid DNA, vero cells were incubated with guinea pig anti-S1 antiserum GP17 at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. another set of cells was kept at 4\u00b0C for 30 min as the control group. surface S proteins were stained with mouse anti-S2 monoclonal antibody SD129-5 and goat anti-mouse AF647-conjugated secondary antibodies (red). GP17 was probed using AF488-conjugated secondary antibodies (green) the fluorescent intensities of surface (AF488) to total S ratios were measured in 20 to 25 individual cells. values of the same sample cultured at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C were analyzed by Student\u2019s t test. antibody-S protein uptake assays were performed at 24 hpt for the two wild-type S proteins (WT1 and WT2) and the four mutants, 5aa, 5aa-A, MK-P10, and MK-P10-V, that formed puncta. cells were incubated with guinea pig antiserum GP17 at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. piglets infected with ic10aa shed significantly lower titers of PEDV RNA and infectious virus in feces than pigs in the other three PEDV-inoculated groups. the villous atrophy was quantified by measuring villus height to crypt depth (VH/CD ratio) of each piglet. lesions of ic10aa-infected piglets were the least severe in all three small intestinal regions (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum) the virulence of ic10aa was milder than that of icPC22A- and ic5aa-infected piglets. the ic5aa maintained virulence similar to that of icPC22A. a pig with an FC score of 2 was defined as having diarrhea. an FC score of 3 was considered to indicate severe diarrhea. dpi, days postinfection; ND, not detected. the three PEDV mutants had significantly lower peak titers than icPC22A at 12 hpi. replication of PEDV induces dramatic membrane rearrangements. one-step (MOI = 5) growth curves of the four recombinant PEDVs in vero cells. Statistically significantly different peak titers (P 0.05) are indicated as different letters. recombinant PEDVs lacking an intact Yxx motif formed larger syncytia than the wild-type virus. we measured multistep growth kinetics (MOI = 0.001) of the four recombinant PEDV in vero cells. surface S proteins of ic5aa-infected cells were distributed in a pattern similar to that of icPC22A but showed less intense staining. lack of both the Yxx and KVHVQ motifs impairs S proteins from being incorporated into PEDV virions. virions of ic10aa PEDV with an S protein lacking the Yxx and KVHVQ motifs contained less S protein projections. TEM images of purified virions of icPC22A, ic10aa, ic5aa, and icYA were evaluated. each image contained about 20 to 60 virions. s or transfected with the S plasmid alone measured the ratios of fluorescent intensities of surface S to total S. expression of M significantly decreased surface S protein levels in the same cell compared with those in the cells transfected with only S plasmid. values in the group coexpressing S and M and the S-only group in each plasmid DNA are shown as means SDs. to determine the roles of the two motifs in the intracellular sorting of S proteins, we constructed 12 plasmids bearing a wild-type S gene (of PC22A) or an S gene with different mutation in the CTs. pairs of mutants (YA and YA-A, 5aa and 5aa-A, and MK-P10-V) were generated. transiently transfected Vero cells were fixed with methanol at 12 h posttransfection (hpt) and stained with an antibody against ERGIC marker ERGIC-53. twenty to 25 individual cells in each sample were selected randomly. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (PCC) values of the S and ERGIC signals in each cell are shown in the box-whisker plot. YA-A, 9aa, 7aa, HD, MK-P10, and MK-P10-V expressed higher levels of S proteins than the two wild-type S proteins on the cell surface. syncytium induction assay was performed by culturing transfected cells in medium containing trypsin. almost no syncytia were induced by the two wild types (WT1 and WT2). GP17 against PEDV S1 followed by Alexa Fluor 488 (AF488)-conjugated goat anti-guinea pig IgG. total S proteins were measured under the mCherry channel. GP17-bound surface S proteins (green) were endocytosed after incubation at 37\u00b0C. both the GP17-bound S proteins (green) and surface S proteins (red) were labeled after incubation. a large portion of the GP17-bound S proteins (green) formed puncta in the cells. MK-P10-V, 5aa, and 5aa-A mutants had significantly lower ratios at 37\u00b0C than at 4\u00b0C. the other six mutants (10aa, YA, YA-A, 9aa, 7aa, and HD) had similar PCC values at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C. these results indicate that the mutants without an intact Yxx motif were defective in endocytosis. GP17 signals in 20 to 25 cells cultured at 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C for 30 min were plotted. GP17 was probed using AF488-conjugated secondary antibodies (green) an intact Yxx motif in the CT is necessary for endocytosis of the S protein from the cell surface to early endosome. cells were incubated with guinea pig anti-S1 antiserum GP17 at 4\u00b0C for 10 min. values of the same sample cultured in 4\u00b0C or 37\u00b0C were analyzed by Student\u2019s t test. we generated three recombinant PEDVs by introducing the 10aa, 5aa, and YA mutations into the CT of the PEDV infectious cDNA clone of strain PC22A. the villous atrophy in the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum was quantified by measuring villus height to crypt depth (VH/CD) ratios of each piglet. virulence of ic10aa was milder than that of icPC22A- and ic5aa-infected pigs. icYA 4 100 A 1.25 0.29 5.47 0.90 A ic5aa 4 100 A 1.00 0.00 6.53 0.08 A icPC22A 5 100 A 1.10 0.22 6.23 0.81 A Mock 2 0 C ND 0.00 0.00 C a Fecal consistency (FC) was scored as follows: 0, solid; 1, pasty; 2, semiliquid; and 3, liquid. groups with statistically significant differences (P 0.05) are indicated with different letters. the alphabetical order reflects groups with median values from high to low. yxx and KVHVQ motifs are dispensable for PEDV replication. lack of either the Yxx or KVHVQ motif in the CT of the S protein alters PEDV replication efficiency and syncytium formation in vero cells. the absence of either motif alters PEDV replication efficiency and syncytium formation in vero cells. the boxes indicate interquartile ranges, the lines in the boxes represent median values, and the whiskers show the range of a group of values excluding the outliers. values in panels A, D, and G were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. surface S proteins of ic5aa-infected cells were distributed in a pattern similar to that of icPC22A. virions with or without S protein projections could be those that lack enough S proteins on the surface or whose S projections were lost during sample preparation for TEM. the ic10aa PEDV contained significantly fewer S projections than icPC22A, ic5aa, and icYA (P 0.05). these data suggest that the deletion of both the Yxx and KVHVQ motifs from the S protein impairs the incorporation of S proteins into PEDV virions. the expression of M significantly decreased the surface S protein levels in the same cell compared with those in the cells transfected with only S plasmid. the total S proteins (mCherry, red), M proteins (green) and cell surface S proteins (cyan) were visualized. surface S/total S fluorescent intensity ratios (AF647:mCherry) were calculated based on 10 to 20 individual cells for the cells coexpressing S and M or transfected with S alone. values in panel B are shown as means SDs and were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. the mutants YA, YA-A, MK-P10, and MK-P10-V had the highest level of surface S proteins. this is probably due to the inactivation of the endocytosis signal. the mutants 5aa and 5aa-A had significantly lower levels of surface S proteins. Detailed mechanistic studies are necessary to answer this question. the endocytosis role of the Yxx motif in PEDV S intracellular sorting. the conserved location of the Yxx and KxHxx/KKxx motifs in the CT implies that the S protein sorting mechanisms may be similar among different CoVs. in this study, we did not detect the colocalization of endocytosed S protein puncta and lysosomal marker LAMP1 in WT1-, WT2-, 5aa-, 5aa-A, MK-P10- and MK-P10-V-pUC19-sgRNA transfected cells. we hypothesize that the internalized PEDV S proteins are transported back to the virion assembly sites rather than being degraded in the lys the virulence of ic10aa was significantly reduced compared with that of the parental virus, icPC22A. no statistically significant differences were observed in the virulence between icPC22A and the ic5aa mutant, which lacks the KVHVQ motif. ic5aa does not cause significant syncytium formation. the third reason may be the altered interaction between S and M proteins in the virion assembly site. sgRNA 3 levels in the ic10aa- and icYA-infected cells were about 3 log10 and 2 log10 lower than that in the icPC22A-infected cells. sgRNA 3 expresses the accessory protein ORF3. however, due to the lack of effective antibodies against PEDV ORF3 and E proteins, we could not confirm these results at the protein level. mCherry-tagged S proteins caused larger syncytia than wild-type S proteins. loss of the two motifs may facilitate rapid spread of those PEDV variants between cells through enhanced syncytium formation. the number of nuclei in a PEDV S protein-induced syncytium correlates with the amount of S proteins on the cell surface. the KVHVQ motif retains the S proteins in the ERGIC, limiting its transport to the cell surface. the Yxx motif decreases the amount of surface S proteins via endocytosis. we hypothesized that the loss of the entire KVHVQ motif in the CT altered the intracellular sorting of S proteins. a similar endocytosis enhancement effect was reported for the Yxx motif of TGEV when its KxHxx motif\u2019s conformation was changed due to the K-to-M mutation. genomic RNA (sgRNA) and PEDV 3\u2032untranslated region (UTR) enhanced the translation. however, it is possible that their efficiencies may vary. in the future, more advanced quantitative approaches could be used to determine their affinities for binding to cellular factors. simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) attenuated the corresponding virus and enhanced the T cell responses in vivo. host antibodies that have already bound to cell surface S proteins would be endocytosed into the cytoplasm, to evade antibody-dependent cell lysis. ic10aa may generate the highest level of defective virions among the four PEDVs, causing attenuation in vivo. lack of both sorting signals renders more ic10aa S proteins to be transported onto the cell surface, decreasing its level in the virus assembly site, ERGIC. sgRNA 3 levels in the ic10aa- and icYA-infected cells were about 3 log10 and 2 log10 lower than that in the icPC22A-infected cells. however, due to the lack of effective antibodies against PEDV ORF3 and E proteins, we could not confirm these results at the protein level. yxx and KVHVQ motifs from the S protein could not completely attenuate a highly virulent PEDV strain in piglets. the ablation of the two motifs was probably not the only determinant of the reduced virulence for those attenuated/mild PEDV variants (FL2013, SM-98, CHM2013, PC22A-P120, and KNU-141112) guinea pig polyclonal antibody (pAb) GP17 against PEDV S1 was cloned into pFUSE-hIgG1-Fc2 vector. guinea pigs were first immunized with the purified S1 subunit mixed with Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant. serum was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) of the Ohio State University. mouse monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) SD129-5 against PEDV S2 (residues 747 to 774) (44) and SD17-103 against PEDV N proteins were kindly provided by Ying Fang. DV replication (32), was replaced with an mCherry gene and cloned into pUC19-sgRNA. the full-length M gene of icPC22A was also cloned into the pUC19-sgRNA vector. other S mutants were generated by mutating the CT of the constructs. vero cells were transfected with equal molar ratios of plasmids encoding the S and M proteins. at 12 hpt, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min. the nuclei in each syncytium were counted. the nuclei in each syncytium were counted. the fluorescent intensity of individual cells was measured by ImageJ software. the channel of a specific fluorescent signal was separated from composite fluorescent images. the total intensity of a single cell was determined by multiplying the cell area by the mean gray value of this area. with 100 PFU/pig of icPC22A (n = 5), ic10aa (n = 4), ic5aa (n = 4), icYA (n = 4), or PBS (mock treatment; n = 3) all the piglets were euthanized at 52 hpi to evaluate histopathological lesions at the acute phase of infection. the diameters of individual plaques were measured by using an agarose-MEM mixture containing 10 g/ml of trypsin. recombinant PEDV-infected Vero cells (MOI = 5) were cultured in trypsin-free medium for 12 h. the data in Fig. 2B, 3B to E, 7D to F, 8G, and 10B are shown in box-whisker plots. the outliers were the values 3/2 greater than the upper quartile or 3/2 smaller than the lower quartile (52). comparisons of means of groups in these figures were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey\u2019s multiple-comparison test. the production of guinea pig serum was approved by the IACUC. mice monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) SD129-5 against PEDV S2 (residues 747 to 774) (44) and SD17-103 against PEDV N proteins were provided by Diego Diel and Eric Nelson at south Dakota State University. the N-terminal 197-aa region in domain 0 of the S1 subunit was replaced with an mCherry gene and cloned into pUC19-sgRNA. this construct (WT1) was subsequently cloned into the expression vector pUC19-sgRNA and designated pUC19-sgRNA-S-WT1. other S mutants were generated by mutating the CT of the constructs using an NEbuild ea pig anti-PEDV S1 GP17 followed by the secondary antibody AF488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG serum. at 12 hpt, the cells were fixed with 4% formaldehyde for 15 min. the cells were permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 for 20 min. if images of the syncytia were captured with an Olympus IX-70 fluorescence microscope. the nuclei in each syncytium were counted. the fluorescent intensity of individual cells was measured by ImageJ software. the channel of a specific fluorescent signal was separated from composite fluorescent images. the colocalization analysis was performed using the Coloc2 plugin of ImageJ software. piglets in different groups were randomly selected and orally inoculated with 100 PFU/pig of icPC22A (n = 5), ic10aa (n = 4), ic5aa (n = 4), icYA (n = 4), or PBS (mock treatment; n = 3) all the piglets were euthanized at 52 hpi to evaluate histopathological lesions at the acute phase of infection. the cells were overlaid with an agarose-MEM mixture containing 10 g/ml of trypsin. the diameters of individual plaques were measured by using an IX-70 fluorescence microscope. recombinant PEDV-infected Vero cells (MOI = 5) were cultured in trypsin-free medium for 12 h. the data in Fig. 2B, 3B to E, 7D to F, 8G, and 10B are shown in box-whisker plots. comparisons of means of groups in these figures were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance."}
