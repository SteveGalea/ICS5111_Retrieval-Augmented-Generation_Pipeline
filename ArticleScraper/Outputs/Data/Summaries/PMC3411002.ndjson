{"summary": "infection of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 requires a fusion reaction between the viral and cellular membranes. this process is mediated by the viral envelope glycoprotein (Env), a trimeric complex consisting of three transmembrane gp41 subunits and three non-covalently attached gp120 surface subunits (1\u20134) the gp41 subunit is responsible for attachment to the target cells, which initiates the entry process by binding to the CD4 receptor and the 6-HB structure is involved in the fusion mechanism of many enveloped viruses (1, 3, 10\u201312). peptide or small molecule-based fusion inhibitors act by competitive binding to the exposed NHR or CHR, thus blocking the 6-HB formation dominant negatively (5, 13\u201315). a series of more potent and stable peptide fusion inhibitors has been developed. we engineered CP621\u2013652 into CP32M (Fig. 1), which shows very strong inhibition on HIV-1 with different genotypes and phenotypes, especially T20-resistant viruses (25). shown are the residue numbers of each region corresponding to their positions in gp160 of HIV-1HXB2. all peptides were acetylated at the N terminus and amidated at the C terminus. they were purified by reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography. concentrations of the peptides were determined by UV absorbance. reporter cell line stably expresses high levels of CD4, CCR5, and CXCR4. cells were maintained in dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (dMEM) growth medium (Invitrogen) all cell lines were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in humidified air containing 5% CO2. the peptides were prepared with 10 series dilutions in a 3-fold stepwise manner, mixed with 100 TCID50 viruses. the mixture was added to TZM-bl cells (104/well) and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 48 h. luciferase activity was measured using luciferase assay regents. chimera containing the N-terminal His6 tag, HIV-1 gp41 NHR546\u2013588, linker \"SGGRGG\" was synthesized and inserted into expression vector pETH. the chimera was overexpressed in Escherichia coli strain B834(DE3) the peak corresponding to the 6-HB size (39 kDa) was used for crystallization trials. the final concentration of NHR546\u2013588/CP32M was 10 m in PBS buffer, pH 7.2. crystal form 2 crystallized using reservoir buffer containing 0.2 m MgSO4 and 20% PEG 3350. trypsin was added to the sample prior to the crystallization trails. crystal form 1 belonged to space group P321, contained one-third of a 6-helix bundle. the distance between the positively charged atom of the basic residue (Lys or Arg) and the negatively charged atom of the acidic residues (Glu or Asp) is 4.

CP32M and its NHR counterpart form a typical 6-HB structure. three CP32M helices wrap around the outside of the coiled coil trimer. the N-terminal QIWNNMT motif of the parental peptide CP621\u2013652 was engineered to VEWNEMT in CP32M (25) the conserved residues Met-626 and Thr-627 fold into a M-T hook structure similar to that observed in CP621\u2013652 (26). this exceptional structure suggests that the M-T hook could be another possible conformation for the VEWNEMT motif of CP32M. the VEWNEMT motif of the CP32M peptide is largely disordered. the conserved residues Met-626 and Thr-627 adopt the M-T hook-like structure similar to that found in the crystal structure of CP621\u2013625 (26) a single CP32M peptide interacts with two NHR helices simultaneously. a single CP32M helix is able to salt bridge two NHR helices simultaneously. the VEWNEMT motif extends the -helical conformation by two turns. the side chains of Glu-622, Trp-623, Glu-625, and Met-626 face the exterior of the 6-HB. the targeting region on the NHR trimer involves a part of the hydrophobic pocket. the side chain of Asn-624 is close to the side chain of Gln-575. the distance from the N of Asn-642 to the O of Glu-575) ranges from 3.5 to 4.5 in both crystal forms. the molecular dynamic approach may be employed to further investigate the interaction between Asn-624 and the residues on the hydrophilic ridge. the view is from the bottom of the 6-HB. three NHR helices and one CP32M helix are shown as helical wheel projections. the color code for the residues is: black, hydrophobic; orange, uncharged; blue, positively charged; red, negatively charged. the VEWNEMT domain of CP32M and its NHR counterparts form an additional layer of the 6-HB structure. the side chain of Thr-627 stabilizes the hydrophobic pocket on the NHR trimer. the side chain of Thr-627 is in close contact with a hydrophilic ridge. asn-553 on the NHR helix does not interact with CP32M. the negatively charged side chain of Asp-553 could then form a salt bridge with the positively charge Arg-557, neutralizing the charge on Arg-557. this is likely due to the presence of the uncharged Ser-644 in the parental sequence, which is unable to form a salt bridge. glu-648 and Lys-644 form an intrahelical salt bridge on CP32M. glu-648 forms another interhelical salt bridge with Arg-557 on the NHR helix. assumed salt bridge disrupts interhelical salt bridge between Arg-557 and Glu-648 on CP32M. recent studies have identified the mutations of Gln-64, Glu-66, and Asn-113 of gp41 as related to drug resistance against a number of HIV-1 fusion inhibitors such as T2635, C34, and CP32M. these residues are involved in the interactions between the VEWNEMT motif of gp41 and its targeting sites on NHR. CP32M has great potential to serve as a unique anti-HIV drug for treatment of HIV variants that are resistant to the first generation fusion inhibitor T20. CP32M has potent inhibitory activity against diverse HIV-1 variants that are currently circulating in china. CP32M possesses broad inhibitory activity on the diverse HIV-1 mutants. CP32M-targeting site does not contain T20- and C34-resisant hot spots. a number of new generation peptide inhibitors with improved antiviral activity have been developed. the structure of CP621\u2013652 reveals key motifs and residues responsible for its stability and anti-HIV activity (26). the peptide of CP32M is highly flexible, but the residues Met-626 and Thr-627 form a unique hook-like structure (termed the M-T hook) that plays important roles in 6-HB stabilization and antiviral activity (26). the novel layer involving residues in the VEWNEMT motif of CP32M presents another unique layer. Gln-575, Gln-577, Arg-579, and Glu-584 form the hydrophilic ridge, severing the C-terminal wall of the hydrophobic pocket. the novel layer can benefit the NHR binding stability of CP32M and thus confer antiviral activity. the distance between the extreme N terminus of CP32M and its NHR counterpart is out of range of any type of molecular force (7\u20138 ). this idea was tested by our mutagenesis experiments showing that the CP32M peptide, missing two N-terminal residues, does not suffer significant losses in antiviral activity. the analogous WNNET motif in SIV gp41 core appeared to be folded into a helical structure, whereas the amino acid sequence difference in the first and second generation HIV-1 fusion inhibitors can easily induce drug resistance by single or multiple mutations at the inhibitor binding site. mutation positions 575 and 553 are located around the N- and C-terminal edges of the CP32M binding site on the NHR helices. this suggests that these residues may play key roles during the docking of CP32M. interhelical salt bridge between Arg-557 and Glu-648 on CP32M contributes significantly to the binding affinity of CP32M. mutant outside of the inhibitor binding site can indirectly influence the binding of the inhibitor to its target on the NHR trimer."}
