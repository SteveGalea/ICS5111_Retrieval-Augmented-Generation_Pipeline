{"summary": "the major viral agents of ARI include influenza A, B, and C viruses (FLU), respiratory syncytial virus (FLU), parainfluenza virus (PIV), adenovirus (ADV), human metapneu-movirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (HCoV), and Rhinovirus (HRV). etiology of respiratory diseases is multifactorial and includes interactions between genetic predisposition and environmental factors (3). study characterized viral spectrum and pattern of ARIs in children from children's hospital \u2018Santobono Pausillipon\u2019 which centralizes pediatric diseases of the entire Naples province. aim of this study was to determine the association between respiratory viruses types, patients features (sex, age, season of disease occurrence) and geographical origin. the research use only version of the filmArray RP system reported a cycle threshold for each positive PCR assay (11) Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 13.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) P0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. Array RP cartridge is designed for the simultaneous detection and identification of following viruses and bacteria of the upper respiratory tract. the filmArray RP system reported a cycle threshold for each positive PCR assay (11) the filmArray RP cartridge is designed for the simultaneous detection and identification of following viruses and bacteria of the upper respiratory tract. most of the patients (319) were 5 years old while 36 were >5 years old. the total rate of detection of all seven viruses was 78% (278/356) of patients. HRV viruses were detected in 44% of patients, followed by ADV viruses (18%), RSV viruses (13%), and PIV (12%). a lower incidence has been highlighted for FLU (7%), HCoV (4%) and HMPV (2%). 1 HRV + FLU 1 HRV + HCoV + PIV + ADV + HCoV 1 HRV + RSV + HMPV 1 FLU, influenza A, B, and C viruses; RSV, respiratory syncytial virus; PIV, parainfluenza virus; ADV, adenovirus; HRV (50/86, 58.13%) are better represented in female patients. HMPV was detected prevalently in 0\u20132 year-old children. the rates of detection were more heterogeneous during the different seasons. groups according to origin from the metropolitan of Naples and neighboring municipalities appear different with a prevalent distribution in extra-urban areas. most of the patients (319) were 5 years old while 36 were >5 years old. double co-infections were detected in 69/256 (26.9%) patients. triple in 17/256 (6.6%) and quadruple infections only in 1 patient. more frequent association was detected between HRV and PIV viruses 19/87 (21%), followed by HRV and ADV viruses 15/87 (17.24%) and HRV and RSV viruses 9/87 (10.3%) s (18/34, 52.9%), while FLU (10/14, 71.4%), HMPV (3/4, 75%) and HRV (50/86, 58.13%) are better represented in female patients. HCoV (5/7, 71.4%) and RSV (18/25, 72%) are better represented in female patients. ADV infection was prevalent in summer (20/34, 58.8%) and spring (10/34, 29.4%) seasons, FLU was prevalent in spring (7/14, 50%) and winter (4/14, 28.5%), HMPV in winter (2/4, 50%), HCoV in autumn/winter (3/7, 42.8%), HRV in autumn (34/86, 39.5%) and summer (34/86, 34.8%), PIV in summer (13/24, 34.8%) and R in detail, 163 patients were female (45.78%) and 193 were male (54.21%). most of the patients (319) were 5 years old while 36 patients were >5 years old. ADV + HCoV 3 ADV + FLU 3 RSV + HCoV 2 HRV + HCoV 2 HRV + RSV + HMPV 2 HRV + RSV + PIV 2 FLU + PIV 1 HRV + HCoV 1 HRV + HCoV 1 HRV + HCoV 1 HRV + HCoV 1 HRV + HCoV 1 HRV + HCoV 1 HRV + RSV + HMPV 1 the detection rate for respiratory viruses was lowest in 2\u20135 years patients. the same trend was highlighted for HCoV, PIV, HRV and RSV. geographic distribution The pediatric patients were divided into two main groups according to origin from the metropolitan of Naples and neighboring municipalities. detection rates for the two areas appear different with a prevalent distribution in extra-urban areas. this appears more evident especially for ADV, HRV and RSV viral infections. HRV (including Rhinovirus and Enterovirus) are RNA viruses related to Picornavirus family (16) the Enteroviruses are categorized into four species, which include a total of 89 serotypes associated with different clinical manifestations (16,17) the more frequent co-infections are between HRV and PIV viruses and HRV and ADV viruses. hMPV belong to the Paramyxoviridae family and the infection in newborns and young children is commonly associated with bronchiolitis. the short-term respiratory effects of air pollution include decreases in pulmonary function (36), increases in inflammatory biomarkers and respiratory symptoms (37), infections (38), and respiratory mortality (39). the environmental risk factors may have an impact on children's respiratory health, above all in urban areas."}
