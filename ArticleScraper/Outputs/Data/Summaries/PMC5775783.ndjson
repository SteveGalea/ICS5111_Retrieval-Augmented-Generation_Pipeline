{"summary": "rarely, reactivation can present as meningitis with or without dermatomal rash making it a diagnostic challenge. absence of preherpetic neuralgia further adds complexity of the condition. the patient was afebrile and his vitals were stable. he appeared weak and in mild distress because of his pain. no oropharyngeal rash was seen. PCR was positive for varicella zoster virus. patient was also tested for adenovirus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43. s were stopped after PCR came positive for varicella. patient was discharged on famciclovir 500 mg every 8 hours for 5 days. rash cleared up without development of postherpetic neuralgia. atypical presentation and unavailability of testing, diagnosis requires high index of suspicion. Isolated neurological symptoms presenting without dermatomal rash can be easily missed once HSV meningitis is ruled out and can result in premature cessation of antivirals. absence of dermatomal rash or preherpetic neuralgia does not exclude varicella meningitis. intravenous acyclovir therapy should be started empirically."}
