{"summary": "the need for the rapid detection of diseases is becoming crucial to prevent the loss of life. it is often too late to take action if the disease diagnosis is performed as early as possible. there are many factors that can cause diseases, such as autoimmune disorders, disruption of the balance in the human body system. dept. is the movement of particles by a trapping force in a non-uniform electric field when the particles and surrounding medium have different polarizabilities. the polarization of the charged or neutral particles is induced by an electric field generated from alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) potentials. polarization of the charged or neutral particles is induced by an electric field generated from alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) potentials. DEP technique manipulates particles in non-uniform electric field. in electrophoresis the particles respond to the uniform direct current (DC) voltage to energize the electrode and attract particles. the movement of particles in DEP is based on the difference in polarizability between the particles and the surrounding medium. p-DEP effect occurs when the cell travels toward high electric field gradient. n-DEP effect occurs when the cells travel toward the low electric field gradient. both of these phenomena depends on Clausius-Mossotti factor. the dep force becomes zero at a specific frequency and the particles do not move. this phenomenon takes place when the real part of the effective polarisabilities of the particle and the surrounding medium equal each other (i.e., Re[K()] = 0) electrode geometry is important factor to ensure stable and sufficient DEP forces being applied to the induced particles. factors such as overheating by the electric field may cause dehydration, membrane disruption and death to the cells. the inhomogeneous electric field required for iDEP platforms is induced when the cross-sectional area of the microchannel is \u201cpinched\u201d by the presence of electrically insulating structures between external electrodes. it has been reported that the polarization of the post (obstacles) depends on the ratio of the medium\u2019s and the post\u2019s permittivity ratio from unity. the electrodes precisely controlled the translational movement of microscopic particles by DEP. in [44], the cells were characterized by measuring the DEP force by varying the applied frequencies. researchers in [46] have replaced the common interdigitated electrode plate by cylindrical interdigitated electrode array. the response is called positive DEP (p-DEP), while if the particles move away of the electrode edge, then the response is called negative DEP (n-DEP) [31] in DEP the particles itself carry electrical potential, and respond uniquely to the different frequencies. electrophoresis of positive charged particles (cations) is called cataphoresis, while electrophoresis of negatively charged particles is called anaphoresis. DEP force applied to homogeneous sphere of a radius r in a suspension medium of a relative permittivity m can be demonstrated by: F D E P = 2 r 3 o m Re [ K () ] E 2 (1) where is the angular frequency of the applied field, E denotes the electric field gradient. CM factor (K()) is expressed as p * m * p * + 2 m *, where p * is the material two main cases govern the relationship between applied signal frequency and Re[K()] with respect to the particle and surrounding medium permittivity and conductivity. the first case occurs when p m and p > m; making Re[K()] negative at low frequencies and negative at high frequencies. the second case occurs when p > m and p > m; then Re[K()] becomes positive at low frequencies and negative at high frequencies. iDEP is a particle confining technique based on the movement of matter in inhomogeneous electric fields that employs insulating structures embedded in a microchannel to produce electric field gradients [36,37,38,39] it has been reported that the polarization of the post depends on the ratio of the medium\u2019s and the post\u2019s permittivity [36]. iDEP showed that particles\u2019 size and the shape of microelectrode have significant effects on the magnitude, location, and shape of the DEP trapping regions. in [39] the researchers were able to segregate certain bio-particles by using asymmetric shaped insulating posts coupled with low-frequency electric potentials. the microarray dot electrode used in [18] was chosen because of the confined area for the DEP manipulation. induced cells were either collected at the dot center in the case of n-DEP, or travel toward the dot edge in the case of p-DEP. the circular electrode provided high separation efficiency without enlarging the device size. many techniques and disciplines have been implemented to help medical researchers and scientists diagnose and assess diseases and patient medical conditions. research in the medical field requires in depth understanding of multidisciplinary fields with more innovative research programs to develop better solutions for healthcare problems. dep techniques are being used in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. somes and peroxisomes, microtubules, mitochondria, and histones for DNA wrapping. prokaryotes possess much simpler cell structures with a smaller ribosome size. cell membrane is also known as the plasma membrane; in eukaryotic cells, the membrane is selectively permeable, enabling only certain compounds to pass through the membrane layer. the membrane is made of a phospholipid bilayer, while the proteins are bound to the membrane surface and within the membrane layer. oncology research oncology is the study targeted on the diagnosis and treatment of cancer. the aim of oncology research is to detect cancer as early as possible through screening and to identify the cancer stages. cancer is an abnormal malignant cell growth that has metastasized and travelled to nearby tissues or other parts of the body. method [80] Osteosarcoma (Bone cancer cells) Identification and monitoring of tumour heterogeneity Label-free cancer subset characterization [81] Prostate cancer Rare cancer cell isolation from blood Improve immunocapture performance [82] cancer cells are hard to detect and isolate from normal cells because genes are mutated and differentiated into subsets. mitotically active precursor cells enables the manipulation of stem cells to pose distinct developmental potential and alternative growth. stem cells can be used in the treatment of wound healing, cell therapy, and drug therapies and have the potential to be developed into artificial organs [92,93,94,95]. dep are a powerful technique to monitor, interrogating, characterizing, trapping and sorting the stem cells even in mixed cultures. it provides rapid, label-free progenitor cell enriched tissue fractions for on-demand tissue preparation in the clinical practices. facilitated diffusion occurs when the drugs diffuse across a cell membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration. the diffusion rate depends on the concentration gradient. most drugs are weak organic acids or bases, while certain drugs are lipid soluble. DEP can be applied as a new in vivo technique to monitor drug toxicity, delivery, development, and screening at the single\u2013cell level. the microelectrode arrays in [112] have generated weak electro-thermal vortices that support efficient drug mixing. Viruses are very small organisms at the nanometer size. most viruses or virions (virus particles) have three main parts\u2014nucleic acid, capsid and envelope. the envelope structure is only present on certain viruses to protect the nucleic acid. iDEP has shown promising results in detecting, concentrating and discriminating between virally-infected and healthy cells by measuring the electrical properties of the cells. researchers have started trapping and detecting viruses using dielectrophoretic impedance measurement (DEPIM) method [122,127] the hydrogel coated microelectrode was used to isolate nanoscale particles to high and low electric field gradient regions. the cells\u2019 dielectric properties were quantified by analyzing the light intensity shift within the electrode\u2019s dot region. this technique avoids using complex labeling and imaging techniques. DEP investigations of bacteria have been practiced in many pathology laboratories from local to central and specialized laboratories. techniques such as staining, chromogenic agar, differential media, enzyme-based reaction or biochemical reaction methods are time effective, accurate and sensitive. the method conducted in [138] is based on g-iDEP microchannel which separates similar bacteria strains of a single species. the separations were based on the characteristic of electrokinetic properties based on local electric field strength measurements. a quadrupole electrode design was used to create the dielectric force. deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is built on the simpler units of the nucleotides cytosine, guanine, thymine, and adenine. it stores biological information and carries the genetic materials for growth, development, body function and reproduction of all known living organisms and some viruses. a common electroporation instrument such as an optical tweezer will damage the cell membrane during the transfection. DEP techniques have circumvented the research impediment by providing a high resolution of isolation and separation of target bio-particles directly from the whole blood and other biological fluid samples. many diseases due to protein deficiencies in the body. deficiencies in protein C and protein S may cause abnormal blood clotting. patients who have cachexia face muscle atrophy, weakness and extreme fatigue. eukaryotic cells have complex membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and peroxisomes, microtubules, mitochondria, and histones for DNA wrapping. eukaryotic cells have complex membrane-bound organelles such as the endoplasmic reticulum, lysosomes and peroxisomes, microtubules, mitochondria, and histones for DNA wrapping. the electrophysiology of the cell is being manipulated to serve different purposes such as trapping, sorting, isolation and separation of cells or microorganisms. techniques such as immunohistochemistry that need antibody and fluorescence labelling do have high sensitivity and specificity. for their operation, a specific antibody, a fluorescent dye, and a dark-field microscope are needed. plasma membrane with the ion/particle flow into and out of the cells. some ion/particles can simply pass through the plasma membrane by diffusion. others need to pass through the protein channel or carrier protein. dep techniques are being used in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells. eukaryotic cells possess a smaller ribosome size and single circular chromosomes. dep techniques are label free, fast and inexpensive. cell membrane is also known as the plasma membrane; in eukaryotic cells, the membrane is selectively permeable, enabling only certain compounds to pass through the membrane layer. active transport allows the molecules to move against the concentration gradient, consuming energy. a cell is mostly determined by the physicochemical properties of the plasma membrane. the dep technique can differentiate the healthy and pathological states of cells by exploiting cell dielectric properties. each cell at a certain pathological state features a certain crossover frequency. conductivity of the suspending medium can be adjusted in a very narrow AC frequency band [19,79]. a particular medium conductivity, can be adjusted in a very narrow AC frequency band [19,79]. Stem cells are a class of undifferentiated cells that can differentiate into specialized cell types. it can be found in embryos (embryonic stem cells), during the blastocyst phase of embryological development and in adult tissue [87,88,89]. adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells found among differentiated cells in a tissue or organ. hMSCs (hMSCs) and differentiation progenies (osteoblasts) by multiple DEP force. mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) and skeletal muscle myoblasts fractionated in a suspension using DEP field flow. hydrogel was able to organize the cell patterning; resembling the actual in vivo cell environment compared to conventional two dimensional tissue culture method. it provides rapid, label-free progenitor cell enriched tissue fractions for on-demand tissue preparation in the clinical practices. passive diffusion occurs when the drugs diffuse across a cell membrane from a high concentration to a low concentration. the diffusion rate depends on the concentration gradient. most drugs are weak organic acids or bases, while certain drugs are lipid soluble. active transport requires energy to transport the drugs into the cell.

P technique was successfully used to trap a single DNA molecule with a silicon nanotweezers. n-DEP accumulation and trapping a single DNA molecule with a silicon nanotweezers. nakano and Ros have extensively reviewed DEP applications in proteins [185]. they indicated that protein immobilization is an obstacle in DEP due to Brownian diffusion. however, in 2015 this problem has been resolved by Laux et al. by using higher spatial atomic force that enables the visualization of the protein distribution on single nanoelectrodes. DEP techniques have shown to be promising diagnostic tools by manipulating the dielectric properties of the cell cytopathic effect in infection [18,196] the DEP techniques also provide a great advantage by preserving the correlation of specificity and sensitivity forcing the compromise of high-throughput and highly specific isolation of target bio- particles with minimal sample preparations. DEP techniques are economically wise, but first thing that needs to be considered is the user\u2014for example, the doctors, the clinical laboratory scientists, the medical researchers and the laboratory technicians. the dep technique needs to be educated, promoted and demonstrated. the DEP technique is an accurate, label-free and rapid technique for cell sorting, differentiation, trapping and purification. it has the potential to unbound the research laboratories from the bulky and complex machines. it does not require highly trained personnel for operation. a few 3D microelectrodes have been widely used to induce DEP effects. however, these microelectrodes were fabricated via complex processes using expensive machineries. 3D DEP electrodes may be fabricated using polymer precursors before pyrolyzing them in an inert atmosphere to become carbon [203] dep techniques offer many advantages in isolating, trapping, separating, concentrating and fractionating bioparticles down to the nanoscale dimension. it is hoped that the frontier gap between biomedical sciences and engineering can be closed and progress to create better technology and improve human health."}
