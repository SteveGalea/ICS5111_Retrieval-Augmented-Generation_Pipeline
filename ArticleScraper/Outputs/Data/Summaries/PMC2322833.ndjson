{"summary": "viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the central enzyme of this \u2018replication/transcription complex\u2019 (RTC), but it also may include other viral non-structural proteins (nsps) and host factors that cooperate to synthesize viral RNA. these membrane-bound RTCs are the molecular machines that drive the RNA synthesis and evolution of +RNA viruses. the viral replicase/transcriptase is of unprecedented size and complexity. it is produced by translation of the partly overlapping open reading frames (ORF) 1a and 1ab. expression of the latter requires a -1 ribosomal frameshift near the end of ORF1a. newly synthesized RNA and several nsps colocalize in perinuclear foci in SARS-CoV-infected cells [8], [14], [25]\u2013[27] electron microscopy established the presence of typical paired membranes, membrane whorls, and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs) the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) was identified as the most likely membrane donor [26] and recent electron tom protease and nuclease protection experiments indicated that viral RNA and nsps were protected by membranes. this further substantiated the functional connection between SARS-CoV RNA synthesis and virus-induced membrane structures. we developed an in vitro RNA synthesis assay (IVRA) to study their activity in vitro. manganese could not replace Mg2+ as IVRAs containing Mn2+ yielded a ladder of small radiolabeled RNA molecules with aberrant sizes. addition of ionic (SDS and deoxycholate) or non-ionic detergents to the post-nuclear supernatant abolished the accumulation of radiolabeled viral RNA. a membrane containing immobilized RNA probes of positive (3\u2032-TR(+) or negative polarity (3\u2032-TR(-)) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled RNA products of an IVRA. a strong hybridization with the positive strand-specific probe became visible, but a similar signal was observed with the negative control RNA. in vitro synthesized negative-stranded RNA was very small (less than 2% of the total RNA), which is in line with the large excess of positive over negative strands. protein synthesis is not required for RTC activity in vitro. radiolabel was visualized by phosphorimaging of the dried gel. PNS from either uninfected or SARS-CoV-infected cells was used. a 10,000g supernatant fraction (S10) showed no RTC activity. almost all replicative activity was lost, while transcription was only 2- to 3-fold decreased, in the P10 fraction depleted of the host factor. the activity of isolated RTCs is dependent on a cytoplasmic host factor. the activity of isolated RTCs is enriched for. electron micrographs of the P10 fractions of infected cells. distribution of newly synthesized RNA between the RTC-containing P10 and cytoplasmic S10 fractions was analyzed by fractionation of PNS after an IVRA. the levels of the five most abundant RNAs in P10 and S10 fractions were quantified. the signals for RNA4 and RNA6-8 were too low to be quantified reliably. the distribution between the cytoplasmic S10 fraction and the RTC-containing P10 fraction was analyzed. ps between the cytoplasmic S10 fraction and P10 fraction was analyzed. a standard 100-min IVRA was performed, followed by treatment with the nuclease Bal31. newly made viral RNA in the cytoplasmic S10 fraction was completely degraded upon nucleas. RNA associated with the RTC was protected by membranes. the latter products only became susceptible to nuclease treatment upon addition of 0.5% TX-100. the replicating RNA is enclosed by membranes. cytoplasmic nsp3 in S10 and pelleted nsp3 in P10 were susceptible to protease treatment. both forms of nsp8 were susceptible to protease in the presence of a non-ionic detergent (TX-100) both forms of nsp8 were resistant to protease treatment. TP into viral RNA was analyzed in a mixture containing NTPs, Mg2+, an ATP-regenerating system, and an inhibitor of cellular transcription. the RTC activity in cytoplasmic extracts produced a set of 32P-labeled RNA molecules with sizes corresponding to those of the SARS-CoV genome and all eight sg RNAs. these products were not detected when using mock-infected cell lysates. in vitro RNA synthesizing activity of SARS-CoV RTCs. in vitro RNA synthesizing activity of sARS-CoV RTCs. in vitro RNA synthesizing activity of infected RNAs. a membrane containing immobilized RNA probes of positive (3\u2032-TR(+)) or negative polarity (3\u2032-TR(-) was hybridized with the 32P-labeled RNA products of an IVRA. a strong hybridization with the positive strand-specific probe became visible, but a similar signal was observed with the negative control RNA. lysate contained large amounts of sg mRNAs encoding these proteins. protein synthesis was completely inhibited when the translation inhibitors cycloheximide or puromycin were present during the IVRA. this did not affect in vitro RTC activity since the quantity of radiolabeled RNA products was unchanged. the activity of isolated RTCs depends on a cytoplasmic host factor. a 10,000g supernatant fraction (S10) showed no RTC activity. a trace amount of the original activity was recovered in the 10,000g pellet fraction. supernatant (S10) fractions were analyzed as described in legend to Fig. 1. group of vesicles (with diameters between 100 and 350 nm) were observed. membrane structures immunoreactive for nsp3 or nsp4 were not detected in a control P10 fraction prepared from mock-infected cells. the bulk (76%) of newly made genomic RNA was recovered from the P10 fraction, suggesting it remained associated with the heavy membrane structures. newly synthesized sg RNAs were, depending on their size, more abundant in S10, suggesting their release from the RTC. the distribution between the cytoplasmic S10 fraction and the RTC-containing P10 fraction was analyzed. the bulk of nsp3 was in the P10 fraction and nsp5 was found almost exclusively in the P10 fraction. nsp5 was found almost exclusively in the P10 fraction. nascent RNA and replicase subunits reside in a membrane-protected RTC. a standard 100-min IVRA was performed, followed by treatment with the nuclease Bal31, a non-specific nuclease that degrades both single- and double-stranded RNA. newly made viral RNA in the cytoplasm was completely degraded upon nuclease treatment. clease Bal31 (lanes 3-6) in the presence (lanes 5 & 6) and absence (lanes 3 & 4) of 0.5% TX-100. the presence of in vitro synthesized radiolabeled viral RNA in the fractions was analyzed. the presence of nsp3, nsp5 and nsp8 in these fractions was analyzed. e-resistance of nsp5 is not due to lack of proteinase K activity. both nsp3 and a host protein cross-reacting with the nsp5 antiserum were completely degraded in this same sample. nsp8 in the P10 fraction was resistant to protease treatment. the newly developed IVRA will allow us to obtain more insight into the architecture and function of the SARS-CoV RTC as a whole. this is to our knowledge the first description of a robust in vitro system for coronavirus RNA synthesis that produces the full spectrum of viral mRNAs (both genomic and sg RNAs) generated in infected cells. a potential complication may be the inability of exogenous templates to enter the membrane-protected RTC. a cytoplasmic host factor is required for SARS-CoV RNA synthesis. the nature of this host factor is currently being analyzed. all of the nsp5 main proteinase copurified with RTC activity in the P10 fraction. it remains to be investigated whether this finding is directly related to the site of replicase polyprotein processing. nsp12-RdRp has been postulated to work in concert with a unique second RdRp activity recently identified in nsp8. non-ionic detergents rendered SARS-CoV RNA susceptible to nuclease digestion. this again signifies the importance of intact membrane structures for viral RNA synthesis. the bulk of newly synthesized SARS-CoV genome remained associated with the heavy membrane structures. crosstalk between cytoplasm and RTC-containing membrane structures must occur, e.g. via channels that may facilitate transport across membranes. all procedures involving live SARS-CoV were performed in the biosafety level 3 facility at Leiden University Medical Center. cells were resuspended in 2 ml hypotonic buffer (20 mM HEPES, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgOAc2, 1 mM DTT,
