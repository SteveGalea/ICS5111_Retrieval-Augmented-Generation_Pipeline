{"summary": "blind, protected brushings were obtained from 20 healthy controls and 24 children with PBB. DNA was extracted, quantified using a 16S rRNA gene quantitative PCR assay. results showed that blind brushings are a valid means of accessing the airway microbiota. reoccurrences are frequent and if not treated successfully may lead to bronchiectasis [1\u20134]. a growing body of evidence suggests that the healthy airways have a resident microbiota which can vary between individuals [5\u20137] and can alter significantly as a result of respiratory diseases such as cystic fibrosis, COPD and asthma [8]. the study subjects were all 17 years of age or younger. written informed consent was taken from parents or legally acceptable representatives of children aged 15 years and younger. none of these subjects had an identified significant immunodeficiency or other conditions. quantitative PCR assay targeting the V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. primers 520F, 5\u2019- AYTGGGYDTAAAGNG and 820R, 5\u2019-TACNVGGGTATCTAATCC were used to target the previously quantified V4 region. BAL was collected from all children with PBB for routine bacterial, fungal and viral screening. DNA extractions DNA was extracted from both swabs and brushes using the MPBio FastDNATM spin kit for soil as per manufacturer\u2019s instructions. analysis was used to identify OTUs significantly associated with PBB. results Twenty four children with PBB and 20 healthy controls were successfully recruited into the study. samples are ordered by a bray-Curtis dissimilarity hierarchical cluster shown by the top plot. the samples are ordered by a bar chart of the top 20 OTUs present in both the blind and non-blind brushings. samples are ordered by a Bray Curtis dissimilarity hierarchical cluster. key to colours used for each genus is included. patient numbers are detailed in the lower plot. seventeen (70.83%) of the 24 patients cultured Haemophilus influenzae. only 9 (52.94%) of the same patients were found to be Haemophilus dominated by sequencing. no significant difference was observed between patients with and without wheeze. samples were rarefied to 1,154 reads using both nose and throat swabs. bacterial abundance was significantly higher in throat swabs compared to nasal swabs. bacterial abundance was significantly higher in throat swabs compared to nasal swabs. neither nose or throat swabs of mothers were found to have significantly different bacterial richness compared to child communities. bacterial communities present in the throat swab of the mother and the blind brush from the child of family 34 were found to have in common a high abundance of Streptococcus. 16S rRNA gene sequencing A total of 146 samples were sequenced on the Illumina MiSeq. these included mock communities, PCR negative controls, kit controls and bronchoscopy brush controls. samples above 1,000 read cut off recommended by QIIME were rarefied to 1,067 reads. samples are ordered by a Bray Curtis dissimilarity hierarchical cluster. key to colours used for each genus is included. patient numbers indicate samples were taken from the same individual. DESeq2 was used to identify OTUs significantly associated with PBB. Haemophilus and Neisseria OTUs were identified as being significantly increased in patients with PBB. control group had 35 OTUs significantly associated, 9 of which were included in the top 20 most abundant OTUs. no significant difference was observed between patients with and without wheeze (R2 = 0.048, P = 0.34) no control patients were diagnosed with wheeze. impact of respiratory virus on bacterial composition was tested. samples from the same mother did not cluster together (S6 Fig) no significant difference in Shannon-Weiner (Z = -0.44, P = 0.7) or Simpson\u2019s reciprocal (Z = -1.24, P = 0.24) diversity was observed between the two groups of samples nose versus throat swabs. bacterial communities present in the throat swab of the mother and the blind brush from the child of family 34 were found to have in common a high abundance of Streptococcus. the bacterial communities present in the throat swab of the mother and the blind brush from the child of family 34 were found to have in common a high abundance of Streptococcus. DESeq2 and indicator species analysis showed that only a Haemophilus and a Neisseria OTU were significantly associated with PBB. this is likely to be due to the number of patients dominated in this particular sample set. however, culture failed to identify Neisseria in any patients. nose and throat samples were collected from mothers of children under 2 years old and compared with the results from the lower airways of their offspring. previous studies have shown that unlike the nose the bacterial community from the throat is more similar to that of the lower airways. the bacterial community within the lungs of children with PBB shows a significantly lower diversity than that observed in healthy children. this is due to the high levels of dominance of Haemophilus, Neisseria, Streptococcus and Moraxella. in many cases the dominant organisms by sequencing were not those identified by culture. 0.001), Simpson\u2019s reciprocal (W = 76, P 0.001) and evenness (W = 65, P 0.001) were observed between the two groups. colours indicate OTUs with P > 0.001 compared to controls. significant OTUs showed a more than 2.5 fold increase in abundance compared to controls. missing data 25 (Mother of Patient 25 throat) and 29 (Mother of patient 29 nose) samples had DNA concentrations below detection limit of the qPCR assay."}
