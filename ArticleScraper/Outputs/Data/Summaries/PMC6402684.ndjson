{"summary": "since 2010, a new PEDV variant belonging to Genogroup 2 has spread across the united states and across multiple Asian countries. a 40.5% premises-level incidence of PEDV caused the deaths of more than 8 million newborn piglets in a single year. one of the most notable PEDV outbreaks occurred in south Korea in late 2013 [14], more than a half million pigs died from PEDV infections in Japan between 2013 and 2016 [16] the S2 domain (aa 735\u20131383) serves as an anchor for viral membrane and fusion activity. PEDV is believed to infect pigs by both direct and indirect fecal-oral routes. the rapid regional spread of the disease raises the possibility of airborne transmission. phylogeographic and temporal data were collected from 92 animal lab reports of PEDV viral infections involving 8,557 pig farms, 37 pig feed mills, 57 slaughterhouses, and 5,806,237 animals. a total of 48 global PEDV whole genome sequences and 49 Taiwan partial S1 gene sequences were downloaded from GenBank. the best-fit model, as determined using jModelTest 2.1.7 [30], had a gamma distribution (GTR+G+I) to ensure topological consistency, phylogenetic trees were constructed using maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian methods (MEGA version 6.0 and BEAST v1.8.2, respectively) annotated MCC trees were converted into a keyhole markup language (KML) file using SPREAD3 (v0.9.6) the KML file can be visualized with an open-access Earth map downloaded from natural Earth. sample collection Epidemiological and geographic data were collected from 92 animal lab reports of PEDV viral infections involving 8,557 pig farms. gene sequences for the 49 global PEDV whole genomes and 49 Taiwan PEDV partial S1 gene sequences were downloaded from GenBank. the best-fit model, as determined using jModelTest 2.1.7 [30], had a gamma distribution (GTR+G+I) bootstrap values >75% were considered as belonging to the same monophyletic group. FigTree (v1.4.2) was used to generate presentation figures. Bayes factor (BF) tests were conducted to build statistical support for transmission routes among geographic locations using SPREAD3 (v0.9.6; BF cutoff = 3). an interior branch test (1,000 replicates) was performed to determine internal node reliability. monophyletic groups were identified as having bootstrap values >75%. Strains shown in box were collected in Taiwan. all 49 partial S gene sequences determined from the Taiwan PEDV samples were used for phylodynamic data analyses. four clusters (A, B, C and D) exhibited statistically significant posterior probabilities (>0.8), including 9 viral strains on 4 monophyletic branches. the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) was traced to July 2013. map was produced from partial S gene sequences identified from the 2013\u20132014 outbreak, constructed using SPREAD3 [32], and visualized using QGIS (v3.2.3) pig feed industry risk map shown was created to assist in the identification of significant risk factors associated with infections. results from our GIS system analysis of positive cases indicate correlations between PEDV infection transmission and both pig farm size (number of pigs, not physical size) a correlation was determined between this cluster and the Genogroup 2 originally identified in the US. some of the viruses collected and identified in 2014 were strongly correlated with one another. others were mixed with viral strains collected in other countries at different times, suggesting multiple transmission events. uan B 2014 0.94 647/648 (99%) KM246693 Sinpi KM246726 Daliao KM246728 Jiouru C 2013.98 0.93 646/648 (99%) KM246713 Jiouru KM246715 Jiouru D 2014. four clusters (A, B, C and D) exhibited statistically significant posterior probabilities (>0.8), including 9 viral strains on 4 monophyletic branches. phylogeographic tree representations of potential transmission routes Results from our phylogeographic analysis were matched to a map of the country to specify the geographic boundaries of the Taiwan outbreak. map was produced from partial S gene sequences identified from 2013\u20132014 outbreak, constructed using SPREAD3 [32], and visualized using QGIS (v3.2.3) correlation data for numbers of PEDV cases and pig farm size, number of feed mills, and number of pig slaughterhouses. phylogenetic analysis of PEDV viruses associated with the Taiwan outbreak confirm independence. phylogenetic and coalescent data show only 9 of the Taiwanese viruses were significantly clustered. clustering was limited to 3 counties in southern Taiwan (Wanluan, Jiouru and Daliao) since that time period, no evidence has been found indicating outbreaks involving multiple virus strains. the highest concentration of PEDV cases was identified in a multi-county section of southern Taiwan characterized by a large number of pig farms with high animal densities. results indicate positive correlations between the number of cases and both slaughterhouse number and pig farm size, and a negative correlation with number of feed mills. supporting information S1 Table. list of 49 PEDV whole genome sequences.
