{"summary": "lynx samples were collected as part of a large study assessing the health of the free-ranging lynx population in Sweden from 1989 through 1999. the study provided baseline data on diseases and parasites of the free-ranging lynx. the main causes of death were traffic accidents and sarcoptic mange (27) 263 lynx (Lynx lynx) collected in Sweden during 1995\u20131999. PCR was amplified by PCR from 24 animals (9%; red circles) light blue areas represent sparsely populated (5 inhabitants/km2) mountainous counties; medium blue areas represent more densely populated counties. dark blue areas represent counties with the highest human population densities (>50 inhabitants/km2) numbers of males and females were equal in the juvenile and adult age classes. within subadults there were more males (n = 68) than females (n = 27). PCR, Electrophoresis, and Sequencing From each sampled lynx, 25 mg lung (n = 262), 25 mg kidney (n = 263), and 10 mg spleen (n = 261) were cut in small pieces. PCR was performed with a Gene Amp PCR System 9700. 5 L of the DNA eluate from the lynx tissue, 1 L of each primer (25 M), 4 L dNTP (10 mmol/L), 5 L MgCl2 (25 mmol/L), 5 L GeneAmp 10X Gold Buffer (Applied Biosystems), 2.5 U AmpliTaq Gold polymerase (Applied Biosystems) and 19 L water. two microliters EDTA (125 mmol/L), 2 L sodium acetate (3 mol/L), and 50 L of ethanol were added to the 20 L sequencing product. the phylogenetic tree was generated with the neighbor-joining method by using MEGA 3.1.

PCR primers from the thymidine kinase gene (tk) were used as described. five L of the DNA eluate was used as template for the PCR. PCR amplicons were analyzed by using the Gibco BRL Horizon 11-14 Gel Electrophoresis System. the gels were run in TAE buffer at 150 V for 1.5 h. the gels were examined by using a gel Doc 2000 documentation system. the phylogenetic tree was generated with the neighbor-joining method by using MEGA 3.1. the reliability of the phylogenetic relationship in the tree topology was statistically evaluated from 1,000 bootstrap replicates. animals with sarcoptic mange were emaciated (other orthopoxvirus-positive animals except no. 213 were in normal condition) no macroscopic lesions in the skin or lungs could be ascribed to a cowpox virus infection. lynx, 18 were in normal body condition, 1 showed no visible signs of disease except for otodectic otoacariasis and being in poor condition. most diseased and emaciated lynx had sarcoptic mange. difference in prevalence was most significant between those with (33.3%, 95% CI 11.8%\u201361.6%) and without (7.7%, 95% CI 4.7%\u201311.7%; p = 0.007) phylogenetic analysis of the OPV tk gene sequences revealed that they clustered with the tk gene of cowpox virus No.H1 and cowpox virus GRI (30) but separated from that of cowpox virus isolates from Sweden (Swe.H1and Swe.H2) and from CPXV-BR. the tk gene sequences of 2 fowlpox viruses (genus Avipoxvirus) were used to root the tree. only bootstrap values >60 are shown. scale bar represents distances in substitutions per site. isolates from 1 person (No.H1) and 1 felid (No.F1) from Norway. clade containing OPV tk sequences from lynx diverged from that of some other cowpox virus isolates. none of these 4 clinical cases occurred near the sites in which the lynx were sampled. wild rodents such as bank voles, wood mice, and field voles have been suggested as the main cowpox virus reservoirs in Finland (23), great Britain (19,22), and Norway (in addition to lemmings and common shrews). domestic cats may also act as source of infection for lynx, as a potential prey species. sarcoptic mange is a zoonosis, capable of being transmitted from rodents to humans, often by domestic cats. cowpox virus infection is a zoonosis, capable of being transmitted from rodents to humans. but it sometimes spreads and causes secondary lesions and complications. x cases in humans have been recorded from Sweden (16,26) carnivores that prey on OPV reservoir species can be used as indicator species for the presence of such viruses in the ecosystem. this finding may be relevant for vaccination strategies (39), especially when considering the use of OPVs as vectors in genetically recombinant vaccines."}
