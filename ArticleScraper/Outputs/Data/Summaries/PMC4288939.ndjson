{"summary": "the virus primarily targets macrophages and dendritic cells. the membrane-associated glycoprotein (GP) in the virus can bind to endothelial cells. symptom of bleeding appears when the virus gains entry into hepatocytes. NK: natural killer; TNF: tumor necrosis factor; IL: interleukin; M-CSF: macrophage colony-stimulating factor; MCP: macrophage inflammatory protein; NO: nitric oxide; sGP: soluble virus glycoprotein 1.2. inhibition of the IFN alarm seems to be one of the most important aspects in the pathogenesis of Ebola. infected DCs do not produce proinflammatory cytokines or costimulatory molecules, their ability to support T-cell proliferation is thus impaired. impaired APCs function and lymphocyte apoptosis contribute to the failure of specific immune responsiveness. the virus primarily targets macrophages and dendritic cells. the membrane-associated glycoprotein (GP) in the virus can bind to endothelial cells, causing cell death and vascular permeability. the latter allows the virus to spread to vital organs. feron belongs to cytokines used for communication between cells to trigger protective defenses of the immune system that help eradicate pathogens. the virus primarily antagonizes both the IFN- and IFN- responses in target cells, especially macrophages, monocytes, and DCs. macrophages play a critical role in non-specific defense. in most patients, Ebola viral burden elevates by time and triggers an extremely strong immune attack. cytokine storm leads to exaggerated inflammatory responses that contribute to lymphoid cell apoptosis and sepsis. the virus eventually disables the vascular system and causes blood leakage. some patients have a delayed and prolonged inflammatory response that leads to a cytokine storm characterized by extremely high circulating levels of numerous pro-inflammatory cytokines. the average levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines in these patients\u2019 blood have been found to be 5\u20131000 times higher than those in the patients who recovered from the viral infection. innate immune responses to Ebola seem to be important to the resolution of infection. humoral immunity is more important at the acute stage for halting viral spread. cellular immunity is more important for eliminating virus-infected cells. a strong depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and plasma cells was found in fatal cases. a strong depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and plasma cells was found in fatal cases. a strong depletion of both CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and plasma cells was found in fatal cases. Survivors tend to have a short-lived, balanced pro- and anti-inflammatory responses characterized by the presence of IL-1, IL-6, and TNF- in the early clinical course. no IFN- was detected in either survivors or non-survivors. asymptomatic individuals produced specific IgM and specific IgG within 2\u20133 weeks after initial exposure to viral sources. the viral titers in the plasma were undetectable during the incubation period, whereas the virus load was similar between fatalities and survivors during the first days of the symptom stage. a strong depletion of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes and plasma cells was found in fatal cases. there is neither precaution for the incubation period nor effective medication for the terminal stage. we propose that an immunomodulatory strategy for the terminal stage may reduce the consequent virus burden. recombinant IFN-2b (200 IU/ml) can suppress Ebola replication by 100-folds in vero cells in vitro. early treatment of cynomolgus with recombinant IFN-2b delayed onset of viremia and death by several days. the outcome highly depends on two cellular-level competing mechanisms. the apoptosis of endothelial cells executed by autoimmune attacks and vascular regeneration by stem cells. the fatality rate was up to 94% in those over the age of 45 years. MSCs reduce inflammation by shutting down the TNF- pathway for immune cell activation and prevent a cytokine storm by inhibiting or disabling T-cell response. MSCs reprogram macrophages, neutrophils, NK cells, DCs, T lymphocytes, and B lymphocytes. non-specific treatment is an essential strategy against viral diseases in the foreseeable future. there has been no specific therapy for even the most common human viral infection such as HBV, HCV, HIV, HPV, and avian influenza. incubation period may render a beneficial outcome Type I IFNs are cytokines secreted by infected cells. they induce cell-intrinsic antiviral states in infected cells. they also modulate innate immune responses in a balanced manner. mesenchymal stromal cell therapy during the terminal stage may prevent cytokine storm, massive cell apoptosis, and septic shock. this fact suggests that appropriate immune responses can help the body heal itself. the outcome highly depends on two cellular-level competing mechanisms. the therapeutic effects of MSCs may depend on the capacity of MSCs to regulate inflammation and tissue homeostasis via an array of immunosuppressive factors. MSCs reduce inflammation by shutting down the TNF- pathway for immune cell activation and prevent a cytokine storm by inhibiting or disabling T-cell response. graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and sepsis can be successfully treated by MSCs. there are no effective therapeutic or prophylactic interventions available to prevent this infection. there has been no specific therapy for even the most common human viral infection such as HBV, HCV, HIV, HPV, and avian influenza. the non-specific treatment is an essential strategy against viral diseases in the foreseeable future."}
