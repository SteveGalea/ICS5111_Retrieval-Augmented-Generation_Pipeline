{"summary": "in the united states, the annual prevalence of ONFH in the year of 1995 is about 10,000 to 20,000 cases. in the united states, the annual prevalence of ONFH in the year of 1995 is about 10,000 to 20,000 cases. steroid and alcohol abuse are well-known causes for non-traumatic ONFH. chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, cation transportation, and mobilization synthesis are involved in the pathogenesis of ONFH. the present study identified the expression profiles of collagens in patients with glucocorticoid-induced ONFH by using this technique. peptides were labeled with Tandem mass tag (TMT), then the TMT labeled peptides were dried by evaporation and desalted onto an Empore C18 47-mm Disk (3 M, USA) a linear gradient from 4% to 30% buffer B (buffer A, 0.1% formic acid in ddH2O; buffer B, 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile) was used for peptide separation. hBMSCs were passaged at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. cells at the three to six passages were used for further experiments. the study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Shanghai Jiao Tong University Affiliated Sixth People\u2019s Hospital (Shanghai, China) hBMSCs were seeded in 24-well plates at 70-80% confluence. culture medium was replaced with osteogenic differentiation medium. alkaline phosphatase (ALP) staining was performed on days 3 and 6. the expression of mRNAs was calculated by the 2-Ct method. -actin was used as the reference gene. the experiments were performed in triplicate. femoral heads were scanned using a micro-CT scanner (Brooke, Germany) at a volex of 9 m, and 2-D images were analyzed by CTAn software. the morphologic changes of femoral heads were measured by micro-CT scanning. data analyses were performed using PASW Statistics 21 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA) a two-tail p value less than 0.05 was considered statistical significant. participants A total of four steroid-induced ONFH patients were included from April 2014 to February 2015. a volume of 1 cm3 of the anterior femoral heads in the necrotic area and adjacent normal area were grinded, lysed and the supernatant was precipitated by acetone for digestion. the precipitated protein was digested to peptides by trypsin and dried by lyophilization. a linear gradient from 4% to 30% buffer B (buffer A, 0.1% formic acid in ddH2O; buffer B, 0.1% formic hBMSCs were cultured at a density of 5.0105 cells/flask in -modified minimum essential medium (-MEM; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosphere containing 5% CO2. forty-eight hours later, the medium was changed to remove non-adherent cells cell proliferation was conducted by cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8; Beyotime, Nantong, China) according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. hBMSCs were seeded in 24-well plates. when reaching 70-80% confluence, culture medium was replaced with osteogenic differentiation medium. the expression of COL5A2, Runx2, Osteocalcin (OC) and ALP at the mRNA level was measured by RT-PCR. the procedures for RT-PCR were: 95\u00b0C for 30 s; 34 cycles at 95\u00b0C for 10 s and at 58\u00b0C for 30 s. the femoral heads were harvested, decalcificated, embedded in paraffin and sectioned at a thickness of 5 m in the coronal plane. the expression levels of OCN, Runx2, and CD31 were detected by immunohistochemistry. the morphologic changes of femoral heads were measured by micro-CT scanning as previously described. the bone mineral density (BMD), bone volume per tissue volume (BV/TV), trabecular thickness (Tb.Th) and trabecular number (Tb.N) pertaining to trabecular bone parameters were quantified. the results suggest that COL5A2 was downregulated in the development of steroid-induced ONFH. the results of proteomic analysis Protein IDs Protein names P-value Q0D2M2 HIST1H2BC protein 0.641317 A0A0A0MS07 Ig gamma-1 chain C region (Fragment) 0.129329 A0A0G2JN06 Ig gamma-2 chain C region (Fragment) 0.108559 P02452 Collagen alpha-1 (I) chain 0.536247 P02458 Collagen alpha-1 isolated cells showed typical characteristics of hBMSCs. MP inhibited hBMSCs proliferation in a dose dependent manner. expression of COL5A2 was significantly downregulated post-MP incubation. incubation in the osteogenic medium of MP treated hBMSCs. expression of COL5A2 decreased during the process of MP induced ONFH in rats. micro-CT scan showed a large amount of bone loss compared to control group. morphogenic changes showed typical ONFH signs post-MP treatment. he staining of the coronal sections of representative femoral heads. arrow indicates empty bone lacuna. COL5A2 in the necrotic area was significantly lowered than that in the normal tissues (P0.05). these results suggest that COL5A2 was downregulated in the development of steroid-induced ONFH. MP inhibits hBMSCs proliferation, osteogenic differentiation and decreases COL5A2 expression in vitro. hBMSCs showed high expression of CD44, CD90, and CD29 and low expression of CD39 and HLA-DR. expression of COL5A2 (A), Runx2 (B), OC (C) and ALP (D) was decreased during the process of MP induced ONFH in rats. micro-CT scan showed a large amount of bone loss compared to the control group. negative staining signals were found in the osteonecrotic area. less positive staining signals were detected in the surviving trabeculae. osteoblast interaction with the bone ECM plays an important role for osteoblasts anchorage, proliferation, differentiation, and function. COL5 is synthesized and deposited in the ECM, where it crosslinked with COL1, 3 and COL6, to form the collagenous tissue scaffold. glucocorticoids have detrimental effects on osteoblasts, osteoclasts, and osteocytes. glucocorticoids decrease the vessel volume and blood supply of femoral heads. a recent study found that COL5a2 inhibited the proliferation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. a heterozygous mutation in COL5a2 gene could lead to connective tissue hyperelasticity. further studies using transgenic COL5A2 BMSCs are needed to unveil the potential role of COL5A2 in ONFH. findings suggest steroid-induced reduction in COL5A2 may attribute to the progression of osteonecrosis."}
