{"summary": "SFVs are exogenous complex retroviruses of the Spumaretrovirinae subfamily (15) they are widespread in various species, including nonhuman primates (NHPs), felines, bovines, and equines. transmission of SFVs occurs via infected body fluids, mainly through biting (6, 38), as the virus replicates in the NHP oral mucosa (22, 51, 52) some groups reported genetic modifications in SFVs infecting humans compared to sequences of reference SFV strains that infect NHPs. these changes include deleterious mutations in bet (9), deletions in tas (62) and polymorphism in the U3 region (65). can these findings be generalized, and do these genetic changes have an impact on FV fitness in humans? a simple clinical examination was performed when requested by participants in the study. none of the SFV-infected persons were ill at the time of specimen collection. all participants received detailed information about the study and gave consent. 1 million to 10 million PBMCs were placed in 10% SVF-containing RPMI medium for coculture experiments. PBMCs were maintained for 2 days in RPMI medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, antibiotics, and phytohemagglutinin (PHA) at 3 g/ml. after 2 days of stimulation, PBMCs were cocultivated with BHK-21 cells (ratio, 10:1) in DMEM. 5 to 6 PCR products from 1 kb to 3.5 kb were then generated and purified. three hundred to 500 ng of each PCR product was sent to MWG Operon (Courtaboeuf, France) for direct sense and antisense sequencing thanks to specific internal primers. DNA from buffy coat or PBMCs (500 ng) was analyzed using the online server Coils Server (www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS_form.html) sequences used were those of prototypic foamy virus (PFV; GenBank accession number Y07725.1; Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii; isolated from a human) a gap opening cost of 10 and a gap extension cost of 1 were performed. the phylogenetic tree was performed using the neighbor-joining method. 100 replicates of bootstrap analysis were done for each tree. PBMCs were isolated on a Ficoll-Hypaque gradient (30 min, 1,800 g) no SFV-infected persons were ill at the time of specimen collection. all subjects provided written informed consent. PBMCs were cocultivated with BHK-21 cells (ratio, 10:1) in DMEM with 10% SVFs in the presence of IL-2 for 7 days. after 2 days of stimulation, PBMCs were removed and BHK-21 cells were passed 1/10 every 3 days. bet stop codon polymorphism was investigated with seminested PCR. DNA from buffy coat or PBMCs (500 ng) was used. DNA from buffy coat or PBMCs (500 ng) was used. the sequences used were those of prototypic foamy virus (PFV; GenBank accession number Y07725.1; Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii; isolated from a human), chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) SFV (SFVcpz; GenBank accession number U04327.1); gorilla (Gorilla gorilla) SFV (SFVggo; GenBank accession number HM245790.1 the five new complete SFV genomes are published in GenBank. the AG15 genome under GenBank accession number JQ867462, the BAD327 genome under GenBank accession number JQ867463, the BAK74 genome under GenBank accession number JQ867464 and the AG16 genome under GenBank accession number JQ867466. for SFV infection in 5 inhabitants of rural south Cameroona Participant Yr of sample collectionb Age (yr) of contact/collection Wound location Animalc LTR/Pol PCR result (buffy coat) Length of coculture (days) the five SFV strains were sequenced by the AG15 and AG16 SFV strains. the new strains shared 95 to 99% similarity at the nucleotide level. the phylogenetic tree prepared with all known complete sequences of SFVs from Old World primate species is shown in Fig. 2. 68 to 94% nucleotidic similarity with SFVagm (Chlorocebus aethiops) AG16 Pol and Env were the most conserved proteins. all proteins were highly conserved (>97% amino acid similarity) SFVcpz Genome N 86.6 86.7 95.1 88.8 80.7 U3 LTR N 85.7 50.6b 79.3 R of LTR N 97.3 97.3 93.3 98.9 93.8 U5 LTR N 94.2 93.5 93.3 95.8 86.2 gag N 85 85.1 96.6 98.7 76.5 Gag P 88.1 87.9 97.4 98.3 80.1 pol N 84.9 95.2 98.2 92 we compared the sequences of the SFV integrase product before and after virus cultivation using DNA from PBMCs and virus-infected BHK-21 cells. we found 99.8% nucleotide identity for AG15 and 100% identity for BAD327, BAK74, BAD468, and AG16. PFV which is believed by several groups to be a lab contaminant. acid sequences of the Gag, Pol, Env, Tas, and Bet proteins compared to the nonzoonotic published strains. we compared the sequences for the presence and location of predicted coiled-coil domains previously reported in FV Gag (74) and found same molecular patterns in AG15 and BAD327 versus SFVcpz, BAK74 and BAD468 versus SFVggo, and AG16 versus SFVag the corresponding SFV Gag region was sequenced and analyzed using genomic DNA of PBMCs from three humans (Ag15, Bad327, and Pyl149) and three chimpanzees living in the surrounding area (X21, X11, and Bel) (1, 7). all these sequences harbored an arginine residue instead of a lysine residue at position 319. the Pol proteins show a conserved protease DT/SGA active center (23). the reverse transcriptase (RT) active center YVDD is conserved (37), as are the residues required for RNase H activity (2). the RT-IN cleavage site YVVN/XNXX is partially conserved (20) the region of Tas from residues 192 to 226 always includes two basic segments required for PFV Tas nuclear localization. the bet protein is a highly expressed and often immunodominant FV protein which is generated from a multispliced mRNA containing coding exons from the first and second accessory open reading frames. the premature stop codon was found in Ag15 and Bad327 PBMCs. it was conserved in all Pan troglodytes troglodytes isolates. this indicates that the premature stop codon is a natural polymorphism. as-specific primers for each species (cpz, agm, ggo), we found that Ag15 had both the SFVtas and the full-length SFV forms as the major strain in PBMCs. Bak74, Bad468, Ag16, and, to a lesser extent, Bad327, had the nondeleted SFV form as the major strain in PBMCs. to further investigate tas polymorphisms, we studied the PBMC DNA of 12 additional SFV-infected individuals enrolled in a previous study (1). we detected SFV in 10/12 samples and did not detect SFVtas (data not shown) thus, SFVtas is present in Ag15, who reported the longest period of infection (43 years), suggesting a role of SFVtas genomes in the long-term maintenance of SFV full-length U3 species were exclusively detected in infected individuals Ag15, Bad327, and Ag16. using leukocyte DNA, we found the L and S2 forms in the sample from Bak74. nucleotide repeats were found in the regions encompassing the deletions. the sequenced PCR products of the long (L) and short (S1, S2) forms are indicated by arrows. the nucleotide regions around the 501-bp and 574-bp deletions are indicated in blue and green letters, respectively, and nucleotide repeats are underlined. showed the presence of FV particles with several envelope spikes and a spherical central core, most of them budding from membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Similarly, BHK-21 cells were infected by two other strains (AG15 and AG16) previously isolated. syncytia in BAD327, BAK74, and BAD468 SFV-infected cultures observed under a light microscope. cells with a clear FV seroreactivity in BAD327, BAK74, and BAD468 SFV-infected cultures determined by using an immunofluorescence assay with rabbit anti-foamy virus serum. AG16, a Cercopithecus nictitans strain (48), displayed 68 to 94% nucleotidic similarity with SFVagm (Chlorocebus aethiops), followed by Bet, Env, and Tas. BAK74 displayed 86 to 99% nucleotide similarity with SFVggo. SFVagm (Chlorocebus sp.), SFVmac (Macaca mulatta), SFVspd (spider monkey), and the five new sequences obtained in this study. each nucleotide (N) or protein sequence of the 5 new isolated strains was compared to the published sequence for SFVcp. z (Gorilla gorilla; GenBank accession number U04327.1), SFVggo (Gorilla gorilla; GenBank accession number HM245790.1), and SFVagm (Chlorocebus sp.; GenBank accession number NC010820.1) isolated from animals. low similarity due to 501-bp deletion in SFVggo LTR. an Env-Bet fusion protein has also been described to be a product of an Env splicing variant (26, 40) we found that the donor and acceptor splicing sites were also conserved. we then compared the sequences for the presence and location of predicted coiled-coil domains previously reported in FV Gag. the paucity of lysines in PFV Gag proteins may be a consequence of prevention of proteasomal Gag degradation (44). in PFV, the unique lysine at position 396 plays a key role in viral replication in primary cells (44). the terminal nucleotide sequence of the bet gene is presented. the pol proteins show a conserved protease DT/SGA active center. the reverse transcriptase (RT) active center YVDD is partially conserved. a high degree of homology of the bipartite NLS is found among new isolates. a high degree of homology of the bipartite NLS is found among the new isolates. a high degree of homology of the bipartite NLS is found among isolates. we sequenced a 401-bp SFV fragment containing the bet stop codon in Ag15 and Bad327 PBMCs before the long-term coculture used for viral isolation. the premature stop codon was found in all Pan troglodytes troglodytes isolates, indicating that the premature stop codon is a natural polymorphism. no other deleterious mutations were detected in bet. nested PCR using tas-specific primers for each species. we found that Ag15 had both the SFVtas and the full-length SFV forms as the major strain in PBMCs. Ag15 was presumably infected for the longest period of time. DNA from PBMCs (Bak74, Bad327, Bad468) or buffy coat (Ag15, Ag16) was analyzed by nested PCR using the tas primers. the expected sizes of the SFVcpz, SFVggo, and SFVcni tas PCR products (765 bp, 762 bp, and 589 bp, respectively) and tas PCR products (464 the size of U3 in the prototypic SFVggo strain is 501 bp shorter. full-length U3 species were exclusively detected in infected individuals Ag15, Bad327, and Ag16. using leukocyte DNA, we found the L and S2 forms in the sample from Bak74. the expected sizes of the SFVcpz and SFVcni U3 PCR products (953 bp and 874 bp, respectively) and U3 PCR products are indicated by arrows. the nucleotide regions around the 501-bp and 574-bp deletions are indicated in blue and green letters. a high degree of similarity between human isolates and published NHP isolates without a unifying zoonotic molecular pattern. genetic changes could be involved in the maintenance of SFV long-term infection in humans (9, 14, 61, 62, 65) genetic changes could be involved in the maintenance of SFV long-term infection in humans. the SFVs from local chimpanzees also displayed an arginine in this position. the absence of genetic conservation does not mean the absence of functional conservation, due to redundancy and compensation mechanisms (5, 30) PFVtas genomes were found in 5/5 experimentally infected rabbits. genomes harboring this deletion may interfere with wild-type virus expression, likely contributing to initiation or maintenance of FV latency (47). characterization of viral cross-species transmission includes characterization of viral genotypes that circulate early and later after infection. intersubspecies genetic variations as well as interindividual SFV polymorphism found to be potentially linked with SFV persistence. a strain directly submitted to geneBank showed a high degree of conservation of the genetic elements previously described in the literature to be important for FV replication. some regions were only partially conserved, but no mutation was found specifically in the zoonotic strains. residue K396, which is important for PFV replication in primary cells, is replaced by a glutamine in the new isolates. tas polymorphism was investigated by Saib et al. (62) PFV genomes lacking the bet intron (PFVtas genomes) were found in 5/5 experimentally infected rabbits. tas polymorphism was investigated by Saib et al. a short form of bet was also found in two individuals and three chimpanzees infected by the SFVcpz Pan troglodytes troglodytes strain. this indicates that natural polymorphism of SFV strains does exist at both the intersubspecies level (gag, bet) and the interindividuals level (U3, tas), with certain SFV forms potentially linked with persistence."}
