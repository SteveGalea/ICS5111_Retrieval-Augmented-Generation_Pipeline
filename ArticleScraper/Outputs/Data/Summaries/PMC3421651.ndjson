{"summary": "henipaviruses (16, 58), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (43) and filoviruses (41) were found in horseshoe bats. a lack of permissive cell lines has been considered one of the contributing factors. betaherpesvirus genome sizes range from 143 kbp for HHV-6 (31) to 241 kbp for chimpanzee CMV (CCMV) prototype strain of human CMV encodes 164 to 167 genes (21), of which about 70 are conserved in all betaherpesvirus genomes. a single clone with typical CPE was picked to propagate in MsKi cells grown in 4 150-cm2 flasks. the infected culture medium was clarified at 2,000 g for 5 min and ultracentrifuged at 55,000 rpm for 1 h in a Beckman SW 55Ti rotor. aliquots were stored at 80\u00b0C and titrated using endpoint dilutions. l calf serum (FCS) were seeded in 35-mm plates and incubated overnight. cells were washed four times in PBS, collected by centrifugation, and stored at 20\u00b0C. the same volume of total DNA was used to detect MsHV genomic DNA by real-time PCR. de novo assemblies of the 454 sequencing output were performed independently with the Roche GS De Novo Assembler (Newbler) and CLC Genomics Workbench v4.8 (CLC Inc., Aarhus, Denmark) software programs. contigs ranging from 2 kb to 75 kb were assembled using the seqman module of the software program Lasergene DNASTAR 9 Core Suite (DNAStar, Madison, WI) ORFs that contained canonical start and stop codons were BLASTed against the local protein database of betaherpesviruses. hits with an E-value of less than e3 were used to annotate the MsHV genome. analysis of the repeats in the genome was performed using the software program Tandem Repeats Finder. protein sequences were aligned pairwise with the homologues of THV, HCMV, and RCMV with the program ClustalW. 78 435 UL24 (30.5) R24 (33.1) US22 family;

HCMV UL84 (98) and UL112-113 (60) contribute to the initiation of lytic DNA replication. MCMV, RCMV, and other betaherpesviruses lack a homologue of UL37x1. the structure of the HCMV virion has been divided into three components: nucleocapsid, tegument, and envelope. the nucleocapsid is composed of at least five proteins: UL86 (major capsid protein), UL85 (minor capsid protein), UL46 (minor capsid binding protein), and UL80. more than 27 HCMV proteins were reported to be tegument proteins. of these the most abundant are the product of UL83 (pp65, lower matrix protein), with 15% of virion mass, and 9% (each) for UL82 (pp71, upper matrix protein and virion transactivator), UL32 (pp150, large matrix phosphoprotein), and UL48 (largest tegument protein). some betaherpesviruses encode multiple MHC class I homologues, such as UL18 and UL142 of HCMV (24) and CCMV (21), m144 of MCMV (64), R144 of RCMV (89), and gp147, gp148, and gp149 of GPCMV (72) a rodent gammaherpesvirus, rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP), was reported to encode three OR HCMV UL18 and MCMV m144 have been reported to modulate natural killer cells. RCMVr144 shows restricted replication in salivary glands and spleen of neonatal rats (3, 40) these proteins have no significant homology to any mammalian proteins (55) RCMV r127 (89) and HHV-6 U94 (83) were reported to be the only herpesvirus homologues of the parvovirus NS1 or Rep protein. RCMV r127 (89) and HHV-6 U94 (83) were reported to be the only herpesvirus homologues of the parvovirus NS1 or Rep protein. b139.2 is only 112 amino acid residues long with a truncated N terminus. most have a potential signal peptide at the N terminus and a transmembrane domain at the C terminus. a sequence alignment revealed more than 10 conserved cysteine residues. different betaherpesviruses carry different numbers of US22 family members. the exception is the THV genome, where the two clusters of US22 family tandem repeats are both located at the left end (2). the genome encodes 18 members of the US22 family. several predicted proteins in MsHV have no homologue in GenBank. one of these, protein b43.1, is a protein predicted to span the membrane seven times. two others, proteins b158 and b160, have 28% identity with each other. MV from guinea pig and Apodemus flavicollis cytomegalovirus 3 from yellow-necked mouse were clustered closer to MsHV and THV than the muromegaloviruses. they form a branch distinct from but related to cytomegalovirus and muromegalovirus. porcine cytomegalovirus consistently groups with the roseoloviruses rather than cytomegalovirus (30, 95) cells were infected with sHV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1. the same CPE locus is shown at 8, 13, and 17 dpi. the amount of viral DNA detected increased with time. cells in 35-mm plates were infected with 1,000 IU and sampled at 0, 2, 4 and 7 dpi. MsHV viral DNA in the cells was detected using real-time PCR. errors represent standard deviations (n = 2). four regions, labeled L1, L2, L3, and L4 in Fig. 3A, had the lowest coverage, 5-, 34-, 11- and 14-fold respectively. the sequence assembly across these regions was further confirmed by PCR with flanking primers. the L1 region could be amplified only with an appropriate amount of GC enhancer buffer. RP1, located at nucleotides 431 to 734, contains 4 repeat units, 3 of which overlap each other. RP6, RP7, and RP8 have 2 overlapping units. RP4 is located between the genes B57 and B69.

HCMV UL84 (98) and UL112-113 (60) contribute to the initiation of lytic DNA replication. THV, THV, and RCMV encode the homologues of UL69 and UL122 but not UL123 or US3. UL82 (pp71) homologue was also found, which is the recently recognized viral transcriptional activator that activates viral immediate-early gene (IE1) expression in HCMV-infected cells. amorphous tegument is located between the virion capsid and envelope. more than 27 HCMV proteins were reported to be tegument proteins. UL83 is the most abundant protein of the virion, but shares very low identity. the identities between the counterparts of MsHV and HCMV follow the same order. some betaherpesviruses encode multiple MHC class I homologues. a rodent gammaherpesvirus, rodent herpesvirus Peru (RHVP), was reported to encode three ORFs. b149.22 was predicted to be a type II transmembrane protein. HCMV UL18 and UL142 and MCMV m144 have been reported to modulate natural killer cells. RCMVr144 shows restricted replication in salivary glands and spleen of neonatal rats. b156 and b163 share an identity of 39%. b162 and b163 have a sequence identity of 29% (Table 2). a transmembrane domain was predicted at the N-terminal end for all of these homologues. the MsHV C-type lectin family shows a 24% sequence identity with its homologue in the English isolate of RCMV. the proteins encoded by this gene family vary in length from 219 to 330 amino acid residues. most of them have a potential signal peptide at the N terminus and a transmembrane domain at the C terminus. a sequence alignment revealed more than 10 conserved cysteine residues. different betaherpesviruses carry different numbers of US22 family members. the exception is the THV genome, where the two clusters of US22 family tandem repeats are both located at the left end (2). the genome encodes 18 members of the US22 family. several predicted proteins in MsHV have no homologue in GenBank. one of these, protein b43.1, is a protein predicted to span the membrane seven times. two other proteins have 28% identity with each other but have no homologue. sHV and BHV2 are closely related to THV according to these phylogenetic trees. they form a branch distinct from but related to cytomegalovirus and muromegalovirus. cytomegalovirus groups with the roseoloviruses rather than cytomegalovirus. the genome of MsHV was sequenced using 454 next generation sequencing. it is 222,870 bp in length and is 222,870 bp in length. genetic stability of betaherpesviruses varies during in vitro passaging. the emergence of large TR and genomic isomers may have occurred very recently in betaherpesvirus evolutionary history. one family encodes MHC class I homologues. HCMV evades T-cell recognition by downregulating expression of MHC class I molecules on the surface of infected cells. downregulation of endogenous MHC class I would expose infected cells to attack by natural kill (NK) cells. HCMC US2 and US3 inhibit the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway. other viruses were also reported to target the MHC class II processing pathway for immune evasion. RCMV was reported to express a C-type lectin protein with high similarity with host C-type lectins (90) but a genome-wide comparative analysis between this virus and MsHV was not possible because of the limited sequence available to RCMV. b149 family gene products have no significant homologues in GenBank, but three-dimensional (3D) structure predication analysis indicated they all contain immunoglobulin-like beta-sandwich folds. the prediction confidence of the b149 family is low, ranging from less than 10% to 35%. the prediction confidence of the b149 family is low, ranging from less than 10% to 35%. there is little information available in the public database for bat immune molecules."}
