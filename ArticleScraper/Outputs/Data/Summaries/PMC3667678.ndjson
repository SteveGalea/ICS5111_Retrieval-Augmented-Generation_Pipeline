{"summary": "study focuses on fractional skin ablation by infrared lasers for cutaneous delivery of drugs, as well as high molecular weight molecules such as protein antigens or antibodies. laserporation is introduced as a versatile transcutaneous vaccination platform. the skin is the largest organ of the body and forming its outermost barrier. it provides protection from physical injury, microorganisms, toxins, solvents, detergents, ultraviolet light and also from dehydration. skin-resident cells are capable of uptake, processing and presentation of endogenous and exogenous antigen. the viable epidermis is composed of keratinocytes. as these cells migrate outward from the basal membrane separating the epidermis from the dermis, they undergo morphological and biochemical changes. a second absorption barrier with ion and size selectivity is formed by specialized tight junctions. 2 \u2013 3% of LCs continuously migrate to skin draining LNs even in the absence of inflammation [16], thereby monitoring the cutaneous environment. LCs have the capacity to present antigen to nave as well as memory T cells after migrating to regional LNs [18]. superficial epidermal trauma leads to activation of skin keratinocytes. keratinocytes release TH2 cytokines IL-4, -13 and -25. antigen and cytokines can also reach the dermis through diffusion. 80% of dDCs is made up by Langerin dDCs, which themselves can be divided into at least two subsets based on their ontogeny. T cells in the skin make up almost twice the number of T cells found in the blood. the subcutaneous fat tissue, also known as hypodermis, is the skin layer mostly targeted for delivery of drugs and vaccines. the white fat tissue acts as a thermal barrier and mechanical cushion. no resident immunocompetent cells can be found there. intradermal injection leads to passive drainage of small molecules by the lymphatic system. larger molecules can be taken up and actively transported to draining LNs by activated dDCs. recent developments in the field of microneedle-based vaccination have been reviewed. keratinocytes react to epithelial stress with production of various cytokines, chemokines and antimicrobial peptides. production of cytokines, such as TNF-, GM-CSF and IL-1, by keratinocytes provides maturation and migration signals for LCs and DCs. there is high demand for needle-free delivery technologies with regard to mass vaccinations in developing countries and also to increase compliance especially in young children. candidate molecules for initiating such TH2-dominated responses include IL-25, IL-33 and TSLP released from epithelial cells. keratinocytes upregulate MHC-like ligands, such as Rae-1 (in mice) or MICA (in humans), eventually inducing TH2-driven responses against concomitantly acquired antigen. infrared lasers have been used for various biomedical applications since the 1980s. their efficacy is based on the fact that biological tissues have a high water content, which strongly absorbs energy in the infrared range. this results in rapid evaporation of water and the buildup of high local pressure disrupting the cellular network. the mildest ablation protocol resulted in highest skin permeability. complete ablation of the stratum corneum induced only moderately enhanced transepidermal water uptake. the high fluence used in these experiments led to extensive thermal injury and tissue cauterization. several studies have used fractional Erb:YAG or CO2 scanning lasers for transdermal delivery of macromolecules and/or vaccines. in a recent review, fractional laser-assisted drug delivery has been discussed [66]. studies using uncharged molecules, such as dextran or polyethylene glycol, confirm that the permeation rate increases with the number of micropores per area. higher fluences clearly enhanced uptake of large molecular weight drugs [68], dextrans [51,62] or peptides [50]. transdermal vaccination with lysozyme was enhanced by laserporation. but applying a higher fluence did not result in a further increase in antibodies. all laserporated groups showed significantly enhanced antibody responses. FITC-BSA specifically attaches to micropores, recognizable as indentations in the skin. in vitro restimulation of splenocytes of vaccinated recipient mice showed TH1, TH2 and TH17 cytokines increased with pore depth. IL-17 and GM-CSF, both involved in TH17 cell differentiation, displayed the most striking increase compared to subcutaneous injection. a clear TH2 response with high IgG1 to IgG2a ratio could be measured. no TH1 or TH17 cytokines could be detected. an equal dose of grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 applied via the transcutaneous route proved to be more immunogenic than after subcutaneous injection. eosinophilic infiltration into bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) is an effective method for painless, needle-free transcutaneous immunotherapy (TCIT) to treat allergic diseases. TCIT did not induce a systemic boost of TH2-associated cytokines and Ig. AHR was assessed before and after TCIT or SCIT via whole-body plethysmography or by invasive measurement of lung resistance and dynamic compliance. data are shown as individual data points or means SEM (n = 12) of mice treated by TCIT or SCIT or untreated control mice. application of gene vaccines encoding reporter gene luciferase to laser-generated micropores did not induce expression. expression at normal levels was measurable after intradermal injection of same amount of nucleic acid. also, no systemic immune responses (humoral or cellular) were induced. laser-facilitated immunization of needle-injected DNA vaccines is a feasible approach when tissue damage and the concomitant release of nucleases into intercellular spaces can be avoided. however, at present, there seems to be no way to perform real transcutaneous genetic immunization by laserporation. fluence is defined as the laser pulse energy per focal spot area. high pulse lengths and high pulse repetition rates increase ablation rate. this results in thermal injury and increased microthermal zones around ablated area. thermal injury and tissue cauterization as the major ablation mechanism of the ArF excimer laser is suggested to be photothermal [46] other lasers that have been used for transdermal delivery of drugs are the Q-switched ruby [47] and Nd:YAG lasers [48] and CO2 lasers. the eCO2TM (Lutronic, San Jose, CA, USA) [62], the UltraPulse\u00ae Fractional CO2 laser (Lumenis, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) [63] and the Fraxel\u00ae CO2 laser (Solta, Palo Alto, CA, USA) [64,65] shows a histological analysis of micropores in mouse skin generated with the P.L.E.A.S.E device the applied fluence and hence pore depth had little impact when applying small molecular weight drugs [57], higher fluences clearly enhanced uptake of large molecular weight drugs [68], dextrans [51,62] or peptides [50]. the effect of fluence on antigen uptake is less clear with respect to proteins. all laserporated groups showed significantly enhanced antigen responses. the micropores served as an antigen depot that continuously supplied the immune system with antigen over a prolonged time. FITC-BSA specifically attaches to micropores, recognizable as indentations in the skin (indicated by arrows), from where it slowly diffuses into deeper skin layers. in vitro restimulation of splenocytes of vaccinated recipients showed that TH1, TH2 and TH17 cytokines increased with pore depth. an equal dose of grass pollen allergen Phl p 5 applied via the transcutaneous route proved to be more immunogenic than after subcutaneous injection. in contrast to the latter, it induced antigen-specific IgE [58] LB/c mice (n = 5) were vaccinated transcutaneously via laser-generated micropores or by s.c. injection with or without CpG-ODN. subsequently sensitized by intraperitoneal injection of alum-adsorbed allergen, followed by intranasal allergen challenge. non-prevaccinated, but sensitized animals (\u2018control') and nave animals served as controls. data are shown as individual data points or means SEM (n = 12) of mice treated by TCIT or SCIT or untreated control mice. vaccine via laser-generated micropores turned out to be a highly promising method for TCIT of allergic diseases. a femtosecond infrared titanium sapphire laser has been shown to increase expression intensity and duration of an intramuscularly injected DNA vaccine without inducing tissue damage. a femtosecond infrared titanium sapphire laser has been shown to increase expression intensity and duration of an intramuscularly injected DNA vaccine without inducing tissue damage. laser-facilitated immunization of needle-injected DNA vaccines is a feasible approach when tissue damage and the concomitant release of nucleases into intercellular spaces can be avoided. however, at present, there seems to be no way to perform real transcutaneous genetic immunization by laserporation. IgE antibodies were induced in the absence of any adjuvant. this contrasts to subcutaneous immunization with the same amount of antigen. the findings match the widely accepted hypothesis that superficial epithelial damage favors TH2/Treg induction, while deep epidermal trauma results in induction of TH1/TH17 response. new transgenic models are beginning to unravel immunological mechanisms of skin-based vaccinations. factors such as application depth, application area and associated level of tissue damage have been shown to substantially influence the type of immune response induced. TCIT of allergy is already investigated in clinical trials. laserporation could address unmet needs in two fields: i) most viruses enter the body via (mucosal) surfaces. induction of mucosal antibody responses is important mechanism to induce sterile protection from viruses such as HIV or SARS coronavirus. ii) SIT of allergic diseases requires up to 50 subcutaneous injections. the skin represents an attractive target for application of vaccines. the immunological status before vaccination via the skin is crucial for the outcome. laserporation has a high potential for allergen-specific immunotherapy."}
