{"summary": "a subset of emerging diseases that was once endemic before developing a quiescence state or were controlled or even eradicated is called disease (chikungunya infection in India) the term \u201crecent\u201d has been defined as 2\u20133 decades. a subset of emerging diseases that was once endemic before developing a quiescence state or were controlled or even eradicated is called disease (chikungunya infection in India) infectious diseases are still the major cause of death in this region. weakened public health infrastructure fails to control such emergence of infections. resistance to the drugs is one important factor in the emergence of infections. drug resistance is now frequent in gonorrhea, Streptococcus pneumonia, HIV, and many other hospital infections. the latest addition to this list is superficial dermatophytes that are showing high degree of resistance to most of the available oral antifungal drugs. emergence and reemergence of influenza caused by the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (H5N1) in 2004,[12] two novel bat-associated reoviruses infection (Melaka virus, Kampar virus) in 2006,[13,14] and a novel tick-borne bunyavirus associated with fever and thrombocytopenia in China in 2009. a fever (chikungunya virus) has occurred since 2006 in many parts of india. the disease is endemic to hyperendemic in south east Asia. about 2.5 billion people living in urban areas of tropical and subtropical regions are at risk of dengue infection. rhesus macaque monkey was limited within a narrow equatorial belt from Africa to Asia like central African Republic, Egypt, Gabon, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, and Pakistan. it is transmitted by the Aedes mosquitoes. death is known to be rare. enterovirus 71 (EV-71) and coxsackievirus A16 (CV-A16) are two most common viruses. other EV types such as CV-A4\u2013CVA7, CV-A9-10, CV-B1-3, CV-B5, E-4, and E-19 have also been implicated. HFMD has caused an ongoing epidemic in China with large number of death. many cases of scrub typhus go unnoticed and undiagnosed; the magnitude may even reach 50% of all cases of undifferentiated fever presenting to hospital for some regions. doxycycline or azithromycin should be started as soon as clinical diagnosis is made without waiting for laboratory confirmation. despite advancement in health-care system, suddenness and unpredictable nature of events leave limited scope for an immediately effective strategy that might be useful to abort an imminent attack. a well-planned health-care system should be built for halting the spread and to minimize the damage incurred by emerging infection. poor research activity which is the direct result of research funding is possibly the greatest threat to scientific development. lack of coordination between clinical and basic research scientists should be addressed to achieve target-oriented outcome. early suspicion and rapid confirmation of diagnosis is vital in preventing emerging infection."}
