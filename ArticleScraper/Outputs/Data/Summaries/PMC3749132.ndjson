{"summary": "data about complex social and spatial structure of interpersonal contacts in the ED will aid construction of biologically plausible transmission risk models. the study was conducted between 1 July 2009 and 30 June 2010. 126 nosocomial SARS infections among patients and staff were traced to direct or indirect exposure to this patient. cross infection of patients in the ED is an important concern to patients and staff in other hospital areas. a global epidemic of influenza results in significant morbidity and mortality. a year-long deployment of a RFID system covering all areas of an adult ED. the ED occupies 25,000 square feet, and includes triage, fast track, acute care, and observation functions. the ED occupies 25,000 square feet, and includes triage, fast track, acute care, and observation functions. the floor plan of the ED was divided into 89 two-dimensional zones. the system was dispersed so RFID tags transmitted their unique identifier every ten seconds. the system was dispersed so that RFID tags would be detected by at least three receivers. psychiatric patients, patients in police custody, and patients who were expected to be discharged within a short time were not approached for RFID tagging. ED staff removed patient tags at the earliest of time of patient discharge (for those discharged), time of hospital admission (for those admitted), or time of study period conclusion. variables were collected from three different sources. we created a 3-dimensional time-resolved adjacency object (TRAO) for each shift in the study. using data from the Radianse system we could determine the number of contact pairs formed among participants and the total duration of contact for each pair. each distinct sequence of 1\u2032s that was interrupted by 0\u2032s was called a contact event. the system was used 24/7 during the entire study year to locate both human and equipment resources in real time. however, during the twelve-hour study periods, research assistants interacted with the system in real time to locate patients, staff, and equipment. ED visits have previously been shown to be a significant risk factor for subsequent infection in the pediatric population, [3], [4] as well as in the elderly, [5]. cross infection of patients in the ED is also an important concern to patients and staff in other hospital areas. resulting contacts have been conducted in a variety of settings. there have been four such studies in settings such as a pediatric emergency department, two hospital wards with airborne precautions, a general pediatric ward, and a medical intensive care unit. RFID tags transmitted their unique identifier every ten seconds. the system was dispersed so that RFID tag signals would be detected by at least three receivers. a proprietary algorithm determined tag location and assigned a corresponding zone identifier. tagging due to either IRB concerns (first two groups) or study staff limitations (last group) patients in this last group were generally waiting in an exam room and had very few contacts. staff RFID tags were issued to assenting ED staff members to wear. diagram demonstrates how three individuals come into contact over a 10-minute period. for each second of each shift we created adjacency matrices in which every participant was cross-listed against each other. by summing in the time dimension we could determine the number of contact pairs formed among participants. initial calibration of the system verified that a radio signal emitted anywhere within the ED footprint would be captured by at least three and typically four receivers. further verification was completed prior to study initiation to demonstrate that a radio signal received from any location would be accurately mapped to the appropriate zone. the system was used during routine, non-research operations, 24/7 during the entire study year, to locate both human and equipment resources in real time. no location disparities were noted during this extensive observation. of the remaining 6062, 941 (16%) were excluded for patient-related reasons (patient refused assent (38%), patient could not assent (13%), nurses recommended exclusion (15%), imminent discharge (21%), other (13%)). another 389 (6%) were excluded for technical reasons, leaving 4732 patient-admissions with usable data. median percent of patients approached for each shift was 65%. median percent participating was 85%. 105 staff eligible, of which 88 (84%) agreed to participate. numbers of contact events are described by shift, by participant, and by participant. Duration of contact is described by total per shift, per contact event, per contact pair, and per participant. a total of 185 individuals in 81 shifts did not make a contact while under surveillance. the median of all types will not be the sum of the 3 subtype medians. the typical observation period, 2084 (median) contact events occurred, with most of type SS. a similar pattern was observed in contact events per participant and per pair. a typical patient participant came into contact with 2 staff participants. usable data were obtained from 81 shifts (78%) the remaining shifts in the sample were excluded due to equipment problems (n = 9; 8%) and insufficient study staffing (due to illness, inclement weather, etc., n = 14; 13%). over the study year 57,514 distinct patient admissions occurred. median percentage of patients approached for each shift was 65%. median number of staff participants per shift was 28 (IQR 19\u201336) staff participants were observed in shifts numbering between 1 and 77. the median of the maximum number of participants in the ED simultaneously was 56 for day and 48 for night shifts. numbers of contact events are described by shift, by participant, and by participant. 185 individuals in 81 shifts did not make a contact while under surveillance. median of all types will not be the sum of the 3 subtype medians. multiple discontinuous instances are here counted as multiple contacts. shift duration ranged from 5 to 12 hours. a similar pattern was seen in contact events per participant and per pair. the cumulative distributions of the number of contacts per participant (degree) by contact type are given in Figure 5. Figure 5. Distributions of the total minutes of contact between participants, by contact type. study criteria excluded visitors and non-ED based hospital staff present in the ED. study criteria excluded visitors and non-ED based hospital staff present in the ED. study staffing was inadequate to provide tagging of patients at the instant of ED arrival. in this case, we assumed discrete contact events occurred when the adjacency matrix elements of the TRAO for subjects i and j were separated by as few as three 0\u2032s. in this case, we assumed that discrete contact events occurred when the adjacency matrix elements of the TRAO for subjects i and j along the time dimension were two strings of 1\u2032s separated by as few as three 0\u2032s. in the case of a highly transmissible virus, such contacts may not generate sufficient exposure to the index case that would result in cross infection. the net effect of this procedure should result in neither overestimation nor underestimation of study results. we attempted to improve staff compliance by issuing permanent tags for staff to wear and providing periodic education sessions. this finding is consistent with simulations conducted by others. if transmission is related to a biological gradient of exposure, pathogens transmissible by droplets appear to have a higher likelihood of cross infection from contagious staff to susceptible peers. patients and staff in particular do not associate in a manner that would be appropriate for a preferential attachment model. newly arriving patients are assigned to staff as staff discharge their current patients. mathematical models of cross infection in the ED may not describe cross infection process correctly. 16 staff were present, on average, in each shift, in comparison to our observation of a median of 28 staff per shift. the average staff had approximately 50 (median), with SP contacts less than SS contacts and for both day and night shifts. in the italian study there was excellent participation (96.6%), but data from approximately half of the patients (39/76) and visitors (30/61) had to be excluded for technical reasons. less than half could be used in the analysis due to reasons similar to ours (i.e. failure of staff to carry tag, technical issues) the validity of this study for the general healthcare population is limited by several factors. the method of this study made it impossible to know how the novel influenza outbreak or its associated publicity impacts generalizability of our results. system setting prevented the receipt of planned alerts regarding weakening batteries. the effect of this decline is underestimation of the number and duration of contacts. study staffing was inadequate to provide tagging of patients at the instant of ED arrival. the waiting room population is very dynamic. there are a number of factors that contribute to this. the front-end process of care requires patients to make multiple trips. study was performed in a busy, urban ED with unique facility footprint. study criteria excluded visitors and non-ED based hospital staff present in the ED (e.g., cleaning staff, hospital chaplains, etc.)

room (series of 1\u2032s) the waiting room is divided into two zones. the waiting room is a large (2500 square foot) open square-shaped area that was divided into two zones. the net effect of this procedure should result in neither overestimation nor underestimation of study results. the net effect of this procedure should result in neither overestimation nor underestimation of study results. pathogens transmissible by droplets appear to have a higher likelihood of cross infection from working contagious staff (i.e. \u201cpresentees\u201d) to susceptible peers. this finding underscores the importance of vaccination of healthcare employees assigned to the ED. polgreen and colleagues report results of shadow observations of staff over 40-hour observation periods during one year throughout a large, academic, rural hospital. authors found 71% of staff contact events were with other staff. both SS and SP contacts and for both day and night shifts were much shorter than the contacts we observed. the difference in the purpose of the unit might be the area of the unit footprint, which we could not determine. 79 days of observation in the french study, less than half could be used in the analysis due to reasons similar to ours [21]. RFID systems and other remote location sensor technologies will find greater applications in health care systems in the future."}
