{"summary": "six adult big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were brought to a wildlife hospital and rehabilitation center (PAWS Wildlife Center, Lynnwood, WA, USA) during late spring or summer because they could not fly. all but 1 bats had visibly swollen and occasionally contused joints involving the long bones of the legs and wings. digital images were captured by using a 2K 2K camera. the state veterinarian and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were consulted. a negative stain composed of 5% ammonium molybdate, pH 6.9, and 0.1% trehalose (wt/vol) was briefly applied to the grid. the grid contents were visualized by using a Tecnai BioTwin electron microscope (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) vaccinia osteomyelitis with arthritis has been reported in smallpox patients. variola virus particles were detected in joint fluid (9), vaccinia virus isolated from a bone biopsy specimen of an affected limb (10,11) the frequency of poxvirus infection in big brown bats is impossible to estimate at this stage. the bat-derived isolate does not group with any of the 8 characterized genera of Chordopoxvirus. its nearest neighbor is Cotia virus, an as yet unclassified chordopoxvirus first isolated from sentinel suckling mice in 1961 (15). levels of shared nucleotide and amino acid identity between them suggest they should likely be considered separate genera. 67.9 70.9 70.1 68.2 67.9 70.9 70.1 69.4 61.5 73.7 50.8 56.5 64.3 51.0 52.4 52.2 GTP 79.1 78.0 79.1 97.8 93.2 75.7 79.4 71.0 71.1 71.1 67.8 67.7 70.8 69.4 68.4 68.9 61.1 71.0 50.2 56.4 64.0 51.0 52.3 51.8 LSD 78. 8.5 61.4 68.5 50.8 55.1 63.2 45.9 48.4 48.6 CTV 68.9 69.0 69.9 69.9 69.9 70.0 70.1 70.9 69.5 70.2 73.0 64.5 64.4 64.4 64.8 66.1 65.4 58.4 65.5 50.3 54.4 61.8 46.4 48.8 48.8 CPX 68.2 68.3 68.0 69.0 69.0 47.3 51.6 55.4 45.3 48.0 47.4 VPX 71.5 70.9 75.3 72.2 72.1 71.6 72.3 72.5 69.0 69.2 64.7 87.1 86.6 90.3 91.1 88.2 82.3 52.7 55.8 63.1 52.9 54.6 54.3 MOC 59.1 59.0 58.8 58.9 58.8 58.8 58.8 58.8 58.8 58.8 58 values above the diagonal are for nucleotide comparisons. values below the diagonal are for amino acid comparisons."}
