{"summary": "seven TB lung tissue samples were freshly collected post-surgery from patients diagnosed with pulmonary TB via roentgenographic imaging. three lung samples obtained from patients with fungal infections and two from patients with lung adenocarcinomas used as controls. TB status was further diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms, radiographic findings and a previously established M. tuberculosis specific IFN- (ELISPOT) assay. PBMCs from 116 TB patients and 28 healthy donors were obtained from whole blood by centrifugation over a Ficoll-Hypaque density gradient. ELISPOT assay was completed as previously described with a 10 g/ml final concentration of antigen (16). cells were stained with CFSE and incubated with or without antigen (10 g/ml) cells were stained with PE-anti-CD4 and APC-anti-CD8 antibodies. a panel of 17 cytokines was measured using the bio-Plex Pro cytokine assay. each group was comprised of three C57BL/6 female mice (8 weeks old) immunizations administered intramuscular (i.m.) with or without CpG ODN 1826: 5\u2032-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3\u2032 adjuvant. seven days after the third immunization, the mice were sacrificed. 123 active TB patients and 34 healthy donors were diagnosed. all subjects were sero-negative for HIV and HBV. TB status was further diagnosed based on clinical signs and symptoms. PBMCs were collected from 116 TB patients and 28 healthy donors. the cells were stained with CFSE and incubated with or without antigen (10 g/ml) in a 96-well plate. a panel of 17 cytokines was measured using the bio-Plex Pro cytokine assay and 17-Plex Group I kit. each group was comprised of three C57BL/6 female mice (8 weeks old), with immunizations administered intramuscular (i.m.) with or without CpG ODN 1826: 5\u2032-TCCATGACGTT-3\u2032 adjuvant. data analysis Plots and statistical analysis were performed using the GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad software) and SPSS software. one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Newnan-Keuls served as a post-hoc test. FlowJo 7.6.1 was used to analyze the FACS data and export figures.

PBMCs from 116 TB patients and 28 healthy donors were collected. cells were stained with PE-anti-CD4 and APC-anti-CD8 antibodies. cell line was used as a reference to detect the peptide binding ability of HLA-A2 (22) the mean fluorescence index (FI) was recorded and the fluorescence index (FI) was calculated as follows. mouse immunizations administered intramuscular (i.m.) with or without CpG ODN 1826: 5\u2032-TCCATGACGTTCCTGACGTT-3\u2032 adjuvant. lung and spleen tissues were sectioned, fixed, and stained. Hsp70 or Gp96 chaperone-associated peptides were pooled and acid-stripped as in references (25, 26) for target peptide identification. all 20 fractions were further analyzed via SDS-PAGE in two gel plates. four peptides, Ch60p, FADp, NADp, and PKAp, were identified and fully meet the three parameters. two peptides, ABCp and CTp, had an Rsp value of 1, but had a lower XC value. the selected peptides contain a useful MHC-I or MHC-II epitope. epitopes for HLA-A2 (*0201) and HLA-A3 (*1101) (MHC-I) and HLA-DBR1(*0101) (MHC-II) were predicted and studied. these supertypes were reported as the most common worldwide. the results showed that the PKAp peptide-stimulated PBMCs from clinical TB patients secreted significantly higher levels of IFN- compared with other peptide candidates and control samples. the pooled PKAp MHC-I epitope peptides also induced higher IFN- levels compared with other candidates groups. 83.75 26.55 21 18 CH60p1\u20139 FLTTEAVVA 19.5 82.9 319.15 82.41 16 13 CH60p6\u201314 AVVADKPEK 71.1 7.9 1603.25 15.14 9 25 CTp5\u201313 AALLPLPTV 23.2 62.1 35.81 47.42 26 4 CTp6\u201314 ALLPLPTVV 4.2 62.4 39.72 86.3 27 13 FADp2\u201310 LRAGERVLI 7 the start site is the number of amino acid in the selected peptide sequence. the chart displays the number of spot forming cells (SFCs) per 2 105 PBMCs from either TB or HD samples following candidate peptide stimulation. pooled PKAp MHC-I epitopes (PKAp-I) and pooled PKAp MHC-II epitopes (PKAp-I) significantly induced CD8+ T-cell proliferation. these groups showed significant differences (p 0.05) when compared with the HD control and other peptide-treated groups. the PKAp MHC-I epitope shows higher HLA-A*0201 Affinity, higher CD8+ T-cell Proliferation, and a Strong CTL Response. the cellular functions of the predicted PKAp MHC-I epitopes were examined. a FI >1 indicates high-affinity epitopes. antigen-specific proliferation and cytotoxity was examined. the pooled PKAp MHC-I epitopes stimulated higher CD8+ T-cell proliferation in TB samples. pooled PKAp MHC-I epitopes and PKAp19\u201327 peptide on target cells led to significantly higher levels of cytotoxicity relative to the OVA peptide controls. presence of PKAp19\u201327 on target cells increased cytotoxicity about seven times over that of the OVA257\u2013264 control. PBMCs were stimulated with three-rounds of pooled PKAp MHC-I epitopes. the associated number displayed the average cytotoxicity ratio. levels of IL-6, IFN-, TNF-, GM-CSF, G-CSF, and IL-17 in the TB group were significantly higher compared with unstimulated patient PBMCs. IL-6, GM-CSF, and G-CSF cytokines have significantly higher plasma levels in TB patients and H37Rv lysate supernatants.

Plot numbers reflect percentage of IFN-+CD4+ or IFN-+CD4+ T cells. arrows means higher level detected groups. LTQ-OrbitrapVelos mass spectrometry was used to identify peptides with a high confidence. of the six selected peptides, four peptides, Ch60p, FADp, NADp, and PKAp, were identified and fully meet the three parameters. epitopes for HLA-A2 (*0201) and HLA-A3 (*1101) (MHC-I) and HLA-DBR1(*0101) (MHC-II) were predicted and studied because of these supertypes being reported as the most common worldwide and present in an elevated frequency in China (28\u201330). Mtb peptides with low percentile rank or low predicted IC50 value were assigned a high predictive score. the associated peptide could provide an effective binding to specific HLA supertype molecules. all six peptides including the MHC epitopes were synthesized for immune function evaluation. the pooled PKAp MHC-II epitope peptides also induced higher IFN- levels compared with other candidates groups. however, the significant increase in IFN- levels still indicates a potential use of PKAp peptides in eliciting T-cell responses. the start site is the number of amino acid in the selected peptide sequence. the start site is the number of amino acid in the selected peptide sequence. cells per 2 105 PBMCs were stimulated with pooled MHC-I epitope peptides from each antigen candidate. the IFN- response measured by ELISPOT assay (TB, n = 21; HD = 6). PBMCs from healthy donors (HD, n = 4) or tuberculosis (n = 4) were CFSE-labeled and cultured with pooled MHC-I epitopes or MHC-II epitope peptides from the six selected peptides. an anti-CD3/CD28 mAbs mixture was used as a positive control (pos) and without peptide group as a negative control. the MHC-I epitopes PKAp9\u201317, PKAp19\u201327, and PKAp21\u201329 had the highest affinity levels (FI = 2.27, 3.21, 1.72; Table IV) the other examined peptides had an FI score 1 indicating low affinity. KAp19\u201327 and PKAp21\u201327 stimulated significant higher CD8+ T-cell proliferation in TB samples relative to healthy controls. no proliferation was noted in CD4+ T cells (data not shown) both MHC-I epitopes had higher HLA-A2 affinity (Table IV) PKAp19\u201327 apoptosis was highly elevated, suggesting it is an epitope candidate for activation of CD8+ T-cell functions. only the pooled PKAp MHC-I epitopes increased GZMB expression significantly compared with the other group epitope peptides and HD controls. PBMCs from TB patients (n = 3) were stimulated once with, C, pooled PKAp MHC-I epitopes, or D, PKAp19\u201327 peptide. associated number displayed the average cytotoxicity ratio of antigen-stimulated T2 cells. PBMCs from HD (n = 2) were stimulated with/without PKAp MHC-I epitopes in RPMI 1640 medium containing 20 U/ml recombinant human IL-2 (rhIL-2) for 3 days and rested for 4 days. this cycle repeated two more times, the supernatants harvested and cytokine production tested. mice immunized with pooled PKAp epitopes showed increased IFN- expression in lung and spleen CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. the results identified candidate PKAp epitope peptides that can act as potential antigen stimulators in vivo. these stains showed no pathogenic damage in lungs. Tissues Clinical pulmonary TB samples, along with control lung adenocarcinoma and pulmonary fungal infection samples were lysed to verify the presence of Hsp70 and Gp96. lysates were subjected to FS-IEF and mass spectrometry techniques. LTQ-OrbitrapVelos mass spectrometry was used to identify peptides with a high confidence. four peptides, Ch60p, FADp, NADp, and PKAp, were identified. two peptides, ABCp and CTp, had an Rsp value of 1, but had a lower XC value. epitopes for each peptide were predicted by IEDB, SYFPEITHI, and MHCPred version 2.0. epitopes for HLA-A2 (*0201) and HLA-A3 (*1101) were predicted and studied. selected peptide stimulation of PBMCs from diagnosed TB patients were evaluated via ELISPOT. the results showed that the PKAp peptide-stimulated PBMCs from clinical TB patients secreted significantly higher levels of IFN- compared with other peptide candidates. the significant increase in IFN- levels still indicates a potential use of PKAp peptides in eliciting T-cell responses.
