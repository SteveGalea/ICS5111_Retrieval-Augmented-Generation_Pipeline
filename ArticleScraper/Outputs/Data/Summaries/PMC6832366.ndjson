{"summary": "coVs are positive-sense RNA viruses that are widespread in humans. they cause enteric, respiratory, or systemic diseases of variable severity. the virus evolves through an accumulation of point mutations and homologous and non-homologous recombination. a previous report from Brazil showed that -CoVs were detected in two species of wild terrestrial birds, purple-breasted-parrot and plain parakeet. this information supports the hypothesis that -CoV can cross inter-species barriers, with the potential to transmit from birds to swine. seven novel -CoVs were found in pigs and wild birds. none were found in Asian leopard cats, bats, domestic cats, cattle, chickens, dogs, dogs, dogs, humans, monkeys, and rodents. samples and RNA Extraction A subset of 1236 avian cloacal/fecal swabs were selected from a collection of 16,672 that were collected for influenza A virus surveillance in different species of wild terrestrial and aquatic birds. 404 were from known species: 234 aquatic and 170 terrestrials; the remainder were from environmental fecal samples. fecal swab RNA samples were tested for - and -CoV using pancoronavirus (IN2deg/IN4deg) and deltocoronavirus-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays. all the RT-PCR assays were performed under the same conditions using QIAgen one-step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia, CA, USA) PCR products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel. the product was purified with an agarose gel extraction kit. previously extracted RNA underwent cDNA synthesis. trimmed reads were de novo assembled using a word size of 64, bubble size of 100, and minimum contig length of 100. -CoV sequences were deposited into GenBank with accession numbers MN379902, MN379903 and MN379904. samples and RNA Extraction A subset of 1236 avian cloacal/fecal swabs were selected from a collection of 16,672 that were collected for influenza A virus surveillance in different species a total of 1236 avian cloacal/fecal swab RNA samples were tested for - and -CoV using pancoronavirus (IN2deg/IN4deg) and deltocoronavirus-specific reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) assays. all the RT-PCR assays were performed under the same conditions using QIAgen one-step RT-PCR kit (QIAGEN Inc., Valencia the thermocycler protocol consisted of an initial reverse transcription step at 50 \u00b0C for 30 min, followed by PCR activation at 95 \u00b0C for 15 min, 40 cycles of amplification (95 \u00b0C for 20 s, 50 \u00b0C for 10 s, 60 \u00b0C for 30 s), and a final extension step at 72 \u00b0C for 10 min. cDNA libraries were sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, reads were de novo assembled using a word size of 64, bubble size of 100, and minimum contig length of 100. -CoV sequences were deposited into GenBank with accession numbers MN379902, MN379903 and MN379904. -CoVs were detected most frequently in samples from american green-winged teal, blue-winged teal and mallard that were among most frequently sampled waterfowl species. -CoVs were detected in the states of Illinois (n = 4), Arkansas (n = 4), Ohio (n = 2), Missouri (n = 2), Maryland (n = 2). the bird species identified were blue winged teal (Spatula discors) (n = 6), snow goose (Anser caerulescens) (n = 4), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) (n = 2), red-tailed hawk (Anser caerulescens) (n = 1) and northern shoveler (Spatula clypeata) (n = 1). of these 14 positive samples, V N-gene sequences shared 69%\u201380% nucleotide identity with various avian -CoV species. however, due to a high number of degenerate nucleotides incorporated in these primers, the amplicons were not of satisfactory quality. we selected 4 -CoV positive samples that had sufficient amounts of RNA and subjected them to NGS sequencing. coronavirus Sample Collection Date RT-PCR Results Sequencing Results UDCoV HKU20 Next Generation Partial N-Gene Snow goose coronavirus/USA/Arkansas0009/2015 1/29/2015 + N/A* N/A N/A Snow goose coronavirus/USA/Arkansas0012/2015 1/30/2015 + N/A N/A N/A Snow goose coronavirus/USA/Arkansas00 avirus/USA/Illinois2562/2017 10/16/2017 + + Yielded 85 -CoV sequences from ORF1a/b, S, M, N/NS7a Most closely related to HKU20 * N/A\u2014Not available: not available: was not analyzed because there was not enough RNA. blue-winged teal coronavirus/USA/Illinois2615/2017; blue-winged teal coronavirus/USA/Illinois2662/2017 and blue-winged teal coronavirus/USA/Missouri3230/2017. -CoVs were detected most frequently in samples from american green-winged teal, blue-winged teal and mallard. bird Species -CoV+ -CoV+ Total american green-winged teal 27/24.5% 0/0% 110 American wigeon 1/5.6% 0/0% 18 Blue-winged teal 27/21.4% 6/4.8% 126 Mallard 16/7% 2/0.9% 227 Northern pintail 1/8.3% 0/0% 12 Northern shoveler 0/0% 1/16.7% 6 Red-tailed hawk 0/0% 1/100% the prevalence of -CoV in aquatic birds was 1.34% compared to only 0.6% in terrestrial birds. blue-winged teal and snow goose were the two species associated with the most frequent recovery of -CoVs.
