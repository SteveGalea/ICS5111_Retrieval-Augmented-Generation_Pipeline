{"summary": "9.6 million new cases of TB infection were reported globally. one-third of the world\u2019s population is estimated to be latently infected with M. tuberculosis. the problem is compounded by the emergence of drug-resistant forms, HIV coinfections, and diabetes (2). ER stress is induced in specific areas of TB granulomas where apoptotic macrophages accumulate (21). ER stress-mediated apoptosis of host cells caused by mycobacterial proteins could be a potential mechanism, which has also been reported for two important TB vaccine candidate proteins. proteomic analysis revealed the presence of a hypothetical protein, Rv0297, in lung granulomas 90 days postinfection (24) it is one of the T-cell antigens for which memory T cells are present in latently M. tuberculosis-infected individuals (25). however, the biological role of Rv0297 remains unknown. this study was designed to delineate the mechanism of action of Rv0297 on host cell death. Alignment of the PGRS domains of Rv0297 and Rv1818c revealed significantly higher variation of amino acid sequences between these two proteins. cloning was performed in pDsRed1C1 expression vector using the XhoI-BamHI site. ing Rv0297PGRS showed rounding-off phenomena after 30 h. cells showed signs of cell death and disruption after 48 h. expression of the PGRS domain leads to apoptosis as evident from cellular morphology. the Rv0297PE domain alone did not show the presence of any disorder region or globular domain. the PE domain of Rv1818c was found to be globular. the disorder has been depicted on the x axis in form of an orange line. colocalization studies were carried out using antibodies against calnexin, specific to the ER, and MitoTracker green for mitochondria. results showed that expression of the full-length protein, its PGRS domain, or the PGRS domain fused with the PE domain of other proteins did not lead to mitochondrial localization. however, coimmunostaining with calnexin antibody indicated ER localization for both Rv0297PGRS alone and its full-length protein. Rv0297 induces UPR pathway proteins and ER stress markers in transfected macrophage cells. total protein concentrations were determined, and equal amounts of proteins (25 g/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane. it can be seen that GRP78/GRP94 and ATF4/CHOP were overexpressed in cells transfected with the Rv0297 PGRS domain alone the effects of the accumulation of the Rv0297PGRS domain on host cell functions were investigated. the levels of ER-specific chaperones/stress markers were investigated. the results were verified by densitometric analysis (Fig. S6) bar graphs obtained by densitometric analysis of western blot data show overexpression of ER stress markers. the values given were obtained with AlphaEaseFC software. the integrated density value (IDV) of each band was detected by drawing a rectangle outlining the band using the spotdenso tool of the software. ER localization of the Rv0297PGRS domain disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis. Ca2+, ROS, and NO levels were measured in RAW 264.7 cells. the PGRS domain induces ER stress through ROS generation. a significant increase in the production of NO was observed (15-fold) in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with constructs carrying the Rv0297PGRS domain. a significant increase in the production of NO was observed (15-fold) in those transfected with constructs carrying the Rv0297PE domain alone secreted basal levels of NO. nuclear blebbing was observed in cells transfected with the Rv0297PGRS domain. hek293 cells were transfected with the PGRS domain of Rv0297. hek293 cells were transfected with the PGRS domain of Rv0297. hek293 cells were transfected with the PGRS domain of Rv0297. caspase-8 activity was measured using the Caspase-Glo assay kit (Promega) Staurosporine was used as a positive control for apoptosis. the PE domain alone of Rv0297 (column 2) or Rv1788 PE protein (column 10) was unable to cause caspase-8 activation. results demonstrated that induction of apoptosis by Rv0297PGRS is facilitated by classical caspase-8-dependent pathways. rRv0297PGRS protein induces ROS and NO production and host cell apoptosis. rRv0297PGRS protein (2.5 g/ml) induced 12.42% 1.26% mortality of macrophage cells. this increased as a direct function of the protein concentration. untreated, negative control; doxorubicin, positive control for induction of apoptosis; Q1-1 (annexin V negative, PI positive), dead cells; Q2-1 (double positive), late apoptosis; Q3-1 (double negative), live cells; Q4-1 (double negative), early apoptosis. stimulation with 20 and 40 g/ml of rRv0297PGRS protein was found to be 43.83% 2.54% and 58.37% 7.92% respectively. effect of rRv0297PGRS protein on generation of ROS and NO was also assessed. the modeled three-dimensional (3D) structure was refined through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. the model quality significantly improved with a Verify 3D score of 0.58. only 1.2% amino acids were in the disallowed region. HADDOCK clustered 106 structures into 11 clusters for the TLR4-Rv0297 complex. it clustered 41 structures into 7 clusters for the TLR2-Rv0297 complex. the complex was then analyzed for stable interaction after long-term MD simulations. rAW-TLR4 cells were incubated with rRv0297PGRS protein. no such interaction was observed without any protein. the downstream effect of action of the PGRS domain is TLR4 dependent. PGRS (0 to 40 g/ml) and the levels of ROS and NO were assayed and found to be exactly similar in both treated and untreated cells. the downstream effects of Rv0297PGRS protein, such as cell death, are TLR4 dependent. alignment of the PGRS domains of Rv0297 and Rv1818c showed a strong conservation in the first 57 residues among the three proteins. some of the residues were present in the PE domain and the rest in the PGRS domain. cells transfected with constructs harboring Rv0297PGRS showed rounding-off phenomena after 30 h. after 48 h, cells showed signs of cell death and disruption. to delineate the mechanism of action of Rv0297 and its possible role in the virulence of mycobacteria during infection in humans, we chose to examine the possible mechanism of cell death. the main difference was the extended disorder region in the Rv0297/Rv0297 PGRS domain compared to the Rv1818c/Rv1818c PGRS domain. the Rv0297PE domain alone did not show the presence of any disorder region or globular domain, possibly because of its short sequence. the disorder has been depicted on the x axis in form of an orange line. experiments were performed to determine the effect of Rv0297PGRS on its subcellular localization. the full-length protein and its PGRS domain were found to localize to the mitochondria. however, coimmunostaining with calnexin antibody indicated ER localization for both Rv0297PGRS alone and its full-length protein. PGRS domain of Rv0297 induces UPR pathway proteins and ER stress markers in transfected macrophage cells. total protein concentrations were determined, and equal amounts of proteins (25 g/lane) were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane followed by immunoblotting with anti-GRP78 and anti-GRP94 antibodies (B) or anti-ATF4 and anti-CHOP antibodies (C) the Rv0297PGRS domain is associated with upregulation of the UPR pathway within the ER. a construct carrying the Rv0297PGRS domain fused with the Rv1788PE protein (Fig. 1B and C, lane 2) induced the overexpression of these ER-specific chaperones/stress markers compared to their respective native proteins. the effect observed was not due to the generic PGRS domain but the specific PGRS domain sequence present in Rv0297, which activated the ER stress pathway. we then investigated the downstream consequences of ER stress. ER localization of the Rv0297PGRS domain disrupts Ca2+ homeostasis. Ca2+, ROS, and NO levels were measured in RAW 264.7 cells. a significant increase in Ca2+ after transfection with the constructs having the Rv0297PGRS domain was observed. a significant increase in the production of NO was observed (15-fold) in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with constructs carrying the Rv0297PGRS domain. Rv0297PGRS domain-mediated Ca2+ release leads to ROS generation. nuclear blebbing was observed in cells transfected with the Rv0297PGRS domain. plasmid carrying the Rv0297PE domain secreted basal levels of NO. production of NO increased 15-fold in those expressing Rv0297PGRS alone or as a full-length protein or as a full-length protein. cells with DsRed1 fluorescence stained with Hoechst nuclear stain. merged images were created using a 100 objective. Activation of caspase-8-mediated apoptosis measured using the Caspase-Glo assay kit. induction of apoptosis by Rv0297PGRS is facilitated by classical caspase-8-dependent pathways, similar to Rv1818c-mediated apoptosis. in vivo localization of Rv0297 from M. tuberculosis H37Rv to the ER of infected macrophages was observed. rv0297PGRS protein induces ROS and NO production and host cell apoptosis. rRv0297PGRS protein induced 12.42% 1.26% mortality of macrophage cells. rv0297PGRS protein induced 12.42% 1.26% mortality of macrophage cells. cell mortality was assessed by alamarBlue assay. apoptosis of RAW 264.7 cells observed upon stimulation with 20 and 40 g/ml of recombinant Rv0297PGRS protein. propidium iodide staining of rRv0297PGRS-treated RAW 264.7 cells was used. both early and late apoptosis of cells were observed upon stimulation with 20 and 40 g/ml of rRv0297PGRS protein. the total percentage of apoptotic cells induced by 20 and 40 g/ml was found to be 43.83% 2.54% and 58.37% 7.92%. tuberculosis were known to interact with TLRs, mainly the TLR2 type. we therefore carried out in silico simulations to predict the identity of the TLR involved in interaction. the modeled three-dimensional (3D) structure was refined through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Alexa Fluor 555 fluorescent images were captured for TLR4 and Rv0297PGRS interaction (middle column), and merged images were created. a stable trajectory from 30 ns to 50 ns was obtained. RAW 264.7 and RAW-TLR4 cells were incubated with rRv0297PGRS protein. they were immunostained with anti-Rv0297PGRS sera to assess the interaction of TLR4 localized on the surface of macrophages with Rv0297PGRS protein. rRv0297PGRS protein-stimulated ER stress-mediated apoptosis. rAW-TLR4 cells were treated with rRv0297PGRS. levels of ROS and NO were assayed and found to be exactly similar. ER stress-mediated apoptosis plays an important role in TB pathogenesis. the appearance of Rv0297 protein in TB granuloma 90 days postinfection point to its role in granuloma maintenance. altered levels of ER stress-induced apoptosis have been shown. ER stress sensors may be upregulated for induction of apoptosis. ER stress pathways are also induced by ROS or NO. an increased disordered region present in Rv0297PGRS may be responsible for differences in organelle localization and function from Rv1818cPGRS. some extra sequences in the Rv0297PGRS domain may contain motifs responsible for ER localization. some of these signals might be responsible for retention of Rv0297PGRS in the host ER. apoptosis has been described in several diseases, including vascular diseases. the ER stress pathway was initially recognized as a cellular mechanism activated by the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER to maintain proper ER functions. pathogenesis and virulence of M. tuberculosis depend on TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9 and their signaling cascades. earliest step in infection is the interaction of host cell and microbial components with the help of PRRs. silico analysis revealed that Rv0297 interacts with TLR4. the induction of ROS and NO from macrophages was found to be dependent on TLR4 interaction. apoptosis of macrophages in advanced stages of granulomas would support dissemination of the bacteria through apoptotic bodies. expression of the PGRS domain of Rv0297 in human cells leads to its ER localization. this results in the expression of proteins involved in the unfolded protein response pathway, i.e., GRP94, GRP78, and ER stress markers. these ER stress responses result in apoptosis of macrophage cells. the human TLR4 protein structure (27 to 627 amino acids [aa]) was obtained from the RCSB protein data bank (PDB ID 3FXI) the human protein structure (27 to 627 amino acids [aa] was obtained from the RCSB protein data bank (PDB ID 3FXI) lubilization in 8 M urea in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.5) and on-column renaturation using a gradient followed by Ni2+-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) chromatography. a rabbit was immunized with 500 g/ml of rRv0297PGRS. images were visualized using an Olympus FluoView FV1200 laser scanning confocal microscope. in vitro infection of RAW 267.4 cells with M. tuberculosis H37Rv. after 3 h of infection, cells were washed with PBS. cell-free supernatant (150 l) was mixed with 50 l of Griess reagent for 30 min. plates were read using a 485-nm excitation and a 520-nm emission wavelength. content is distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license. download TABLE S4, DOCX file, 0.1 MB (96.1KB, docx) the PE18 gene (Rv1788), Rv0297, Rv1818c full-length gene, and their PE and PGRS domains were cloned as C-terminal fusions into pDsRed1C1 vector. the primer sequences and PCR conditions are listed in Tables S1 and S2 in the supplemental material.
