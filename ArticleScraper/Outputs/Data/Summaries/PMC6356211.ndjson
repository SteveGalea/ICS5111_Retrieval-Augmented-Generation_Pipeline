{"summary": "arthropod-borne viruses exhibit worldwide distribution and are a constant threat, not only for the public health but also for wildlife, domestic animals, and even plants. the rise in global travel and trade as well as the changes in the global climate conditions are facilitating the expansion of the vector transmitters, including mosquitoes, ticks, sandflies, and midges among other arthropods. immunocompetent wild-type mice are susceptible to infections with a number of viral pathogens such as influenza virus [9] and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [10] and rift Valley fever virus [11]. the pathogenesis of disease in humans is partially mimicked. the role of interferons (IFNs) against viral diseases has been widely studied. both type I and type II IFNs have been implicated in the host antiviral defense and immunomodulatory functions that are critical during virus infection. type I IFNs are well known for their ability to directly induce an antiviral response within infected cells. specialized immune cells known as plasmacytoid dendritic cells produce the vast majority of IFN-. the role of type I IFN production during apoptosis has also been studied. it is known that cells treated with type I IFNs sensitize them to apoptosis upon subsequent viral infection. the role of type I IFN production during apoptosis has also been studied. the IFNAR(/) knock-out receptor mouse model has been used to study infection, disease, pathogenesis and vaccine testing against multiple arbovirus families. in this review, animal arbovirus families known to have been studied using the IFNAR(/) mice model are mentioned, describing briefly some examples. DNA-Gn/Gc/N, DNA-N-terminal GC, recombinant-N-terminal GC Dengue virus. live attenuated mutants in the 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (2\u2032-O-MTase) of DENV-1 and DENV-2 Yellow fever virus. ND Thogoto virus [63,64] Yes Pathological lesions in the lungs, liver and intestine. DNA, Herpesvirus Poxvirus, Baculovirus, and bacterial expressed proteins. AHSV-1 AHSV-3 AHSV-4 AHSV-9 Yes Splenomegaly, necrotic foci in the liver. zoonotic disease of ruminants has been confined to sub-saharan africa for decades. zoonosis is associated with \"abortion storms\" in domesticated sheep flocks and high mortality rates in newborn livestock [70]. IFNAR(/) mice were used as a candidate model for testing the efficacy of experimental vaccines and therapeutics against RVFV under a BSL-2 containment environment. the efficacy of DNA vaccines encoding different RVFV antigens was tested in this model, showing several degrees of protection upon a lethal challenge. CCHF alum-adjuvanted vaccines, VLPs, DNA or viral vector vaccines conferred different rates of protection in immunized animals. administration of Favipiravir after infection suppressed the infection and the clinical signs in treated mice. Schmallenberg virus has spread across the european continent, spanning from Ireland to Turkey [75], since its discovery in Germany in 2011. mice showed decreased weight loss, ataxia, apathy, but limited mortality. FNAR(/) mice showed decreased weight loss, ataxia, apathy, but limited mortality. relationship between type I IFN and viral spreading has been investigated. a phlebovirus transmitted by aedes mosquitoes has been confined to sub-saharan africa for many decades. this zoonosis is associated with \"abortion storms\" in domesticated sheep flocks and high mortality rates in newborn livestock. the viral and host cellular factors that contribute to RVFV virulence are still poorly understood. the efficacy of experimental vaccines and therapeutics against RVFV was tested in this model, showing several degrees of protection upon a lethal challenge. the antiviral activity of silver nanoparticles was also tested in these mice showing reduced viremia and delayed mortality after lethal challenge. CCHF alum-adjuvanted vaccines, VLPs, DNA or viral vector vaccines conferred different rates of protection in immunized animals. Schmallenberg virus (SBV) causes congenital malformations and stillbirths in cattle, sheep, goat, and possibly in alpaca. it is one non-zoonotic virus of this group with outbreak potential among domestic animals. in 2012, mice showed decreased weight loss, ataxia, apathy, but limited mortality. in recent studies, it has been demonstrated that SBV virulence occurs as early as three days post-infection (dpi) and it becomes more severe at day six post-infection. flaviviridae Flaviviridae are a family of positive, single-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses. they are transmitted by mosquitoes and ticks and cause morbidity and mortality throughout the world. some of them are known to produce hemorrhagic diseases, such as dengue Fever virus (DENV), Yellow Fever virus (YFV), and Zika virus (ZIKV) a pathological analysis was performed in IFNAR(/) mice. it has been shown that mortality rates depend on the DENV serotype. a severe dengue-like disease is observed when animals are infected with sufficiently high DENV2 challenge doses. Inoculation of wild-type 129 mice subcutaneously (sc) in each rear footpad with 104 PFU of YFV did not result in any weight loss or death. challenged 3\u20134 week old IFNAR mice (129 background) developed disease under the same conditions. in 2015, an epidemic of ZIKV originating from Brazil spread through most of North and South America and the Caribbean. in some cases the disease courses with fever, joint pain, maculopapular rash, and red eyes. no deaths have been reported from ZIKV infections, but mother-to-child transmission may result in congenital Zika syndrome. five- to 6-week-old mice sc infected with 102 focus-forming units (FFUs) began to lose weight by five days after infection. by day seven, animals had lost between 15% and 25% of their starting body weight. infection with 103 FFU of ZIKV (H/PF/2013) reduced the weight in all animals. the route of inoculation does not seem to be significant among subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and footpad administration. only ip resulted in uniform lethality in young IFNAR(/) mice. sexual and maternal transmission are the most important concerns in Zika disease due to the consequences derived from ZIKV infection in the fetus. FNAR(/) littermates continue to develop, even having higher ZIKV titers in their placentas. new generation vaccines have been shown effective against ZIKV in IFNAR(/) mice based on VSV viral vector expressing pRM and E ZIKV proteins. a single vaccine of mice induces neutralizing antibodies and prevent viremia and fetal/placental infection in female IFNAR(/) mice. west Nile virus infection of humans can be characterized as asymptomatic or mild, febrile illness termed west Nile fever. however, a significant increase in global incidence of severe neurological disease arose in the mid-1990s. after its introduction in 1999, WNV rapidly spread across the continent and now appears to have established itself in the ecology of North America. in vivo, IFNAR(/) mice showed enhanced BBB permeability and TJ dysregulation after WNV infection, triggered by pattern recognition receptors-mediated cytokine expression. a novel single-cycle flavivirus vaccine has been tested, with a significant increase in the level of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells compared to the wild-type. dengue Virus is the etiologic agent of the self-limited febrile illness dengue fever (DF), as well as the potentially lethal severe dengue disease (dHF/DSS) symptomatic infections are characterized by: fever, retro-orbital headache, muscle, joint and bone pain, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, mucosal bleeding and thrombocytopenia. a pathological analysis was performed in IFNAR(/) mice. mortality rates depend on the DENV serotype and strain used. a severe dengue-like disease is observed when animals are infected with sufficiently high DENV2 challenge doses. Inoculation of wild-type 129 mice subcutaneously (sc) in each rear footpad with 104 PFU of YFV did not result in weight loss or death. challenged 3\u20134 week old IFNAR(/) mice (129 background) challenged with YFV strains Asibi or Angola73 developed disease under the same conditions. Zika virus infections in adults are associated with Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome. wild-type mice are refractory to Zika infection with strain MP1751. inflammatory and degenerative changes could be detected in the brain. in older mice, infection with 103 FFU of ZIKV (H/PF/2013) reduced the weight in all animals. 30% of starting weight lost by nine days after infection, and a mortality of 60\u201320% were observed. high levels of viral RNA and antigen within the epididymal lumen was observed in IFNAR(/) males. serum testosterone levels were markedly decreased at 8 dpi. in females, vaginal infection with high doses of ZIKV was lethal. single vaccine of mice induces neutralizing antibodies and prevent viremia and fetal/placental infection in female IFNAR(/) mice and testes infection and pathology in male IFNAR(/) mice. salivary factors expressed by the vector Aedes aegypti modulates ZIKV infectivity. NV lineage I infections arose in the mid-1990s, culminating in the U.S. outbreak in 2003, which included 9862 reported cases and 264 deaths. the rapid emergence of WNV and its virulence within a nave population suggest that epidemic forms of the virus may encode mechanisms to evade host immunity. a novel single-cycle flavivirus vaccine has been tested, with a significant increase in the level of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells compared to the wild-type. encephalitis is considered one of the most important encephalitic arthropod-borne diseases. chikungunya Virus Wild-type mice infected with 104 cell culture infectious dose 50 (CCID50) of CHIKV produced a measurable self-limiting foot swelling with clear histological signs of acute and persistent inflammatory disease. the viral load in IFNAR(/) mice infected with 106 PFU at 2 dpi was >108 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)/mL. fibroblasts constitute the principal CHIKV cell target in all these organs. CHIKV antigens are detected in sinusoidal capillary endothelial cells. at 3 dpi, there is a sharp increase in viremia, with CHIKV antigens detectable in the red pulp of the spleen. a vaccine based on a chimeric VSV that expresses the CHIKV envelope polyprotein (E3-E2-6K-E1) and also expresses the membrane-envelope glycoproteins of ZIKV has been generated. the replication-defective nature of EILV/CHIKV in vertebrate cells elicited rapid (within four days) and long-lasting (>290 days) neutralizing antibodies that provided complete protection in IFNAR( the prototypic alphavirus, Sindbis virus strain AR339, was isolated by ic inoculation of three-day-old mice with a mosquito homogenate. in wild-type mice, the infection courses asymptomatic, while IFNAR(/) mice inoculated sc with 102 PFUs of TR339 succumbed to the infection within 3\u20134 dpi. by 24 hpi, a high-titer serum vir infected mice exhibited 50\u201355% mortality after a sc dose of 103 PFU. the ONNV was present in the brain and skeletal muscle of IFNAR(/) mice. the presence of virus in the heart could be a function of myocyte tropism as has been reported in CHIKV infection. the viral load in mice infected with 106 PFU at 2 dpi was >108 tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50)/mL. wild-type animals cleared the infection with undetectable serum viral titers at all timepoints tested. CHIKV exhibits a marked tropism for skeletal muscles, joints and skin. anti-CHIKV monoclonal antibodies (CHK-102, CHK-152, CHK-166, and CHK-263) were selected for their ability to inhibit infection of all three CHIKV genotypes. four neutralizing MAbs (CHK-102, CHK-152, CHK-166, and CHK-263) provided complete protection against a lethal challenge. despite its ability to replicate to exceptionally high titers in insect cells, elicited rapid (within four days) and long-lasting (>290 days) neutralizing antibodies. this platform represents the first structurally native application of an insect-specific virus in preclinical vaccine development. IFNAR(/) mice infected with Venezuelan equine encephalitis (VEE) exhibit progressively increasing signs of infection characterized by pronounced hunching, lethargy, prostration, and death. inflammatory infiltrate seen in the tissues of mice was composed predominantly of monocytes and myositis. rhabdoviridae contains six genera: Lyssavirus, Ephemerovirus, norvirhabdovirus, Cytorhabdovirus, and Vesiculovirus. the prototype of the genus is VSV, an arthropod-borne virus that primarily affects rodents, cattle, swine and horses. encapsidated by a nucleoprotein (NP) encodes 11 proteins. they present a global distribution, are more common in winter. they are characterized by causing an acute infection of the respiratory tract. the genus Orbivirus, within the family Reovidae, can infect equids, ruminants, camelids, marsupials, seabirds, batsm and in some cases humans. the more relevant orbiviruses in animal health are Bluetongue virus (BTV), African horse sickness virus (AHSV) and Epizootic hemorrhagic disease virus (EHDV). studies of viral progression in IFNAR(/) mice showed that infectious virus is recovered from the spleen, lung, thymus, lymph nodes, and blood. infected thymus exhibits a profound lymphoid depletion, a loss of thymic architecture as the medulla and the cortex are hardly distinguishable. changes in hematology including thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia have been determined after infection of IFNAR(/) mice with a high virulent strain of BTV-4 [66], observations similar to those described in experimental BTV infections [65,140]. this mouse model has been used to study the determinants of virulence of BTV field strains. the efficacy of novel recombinant subunit, DNA, and viral vector vaccines have been tested in the IFNAR(/) mouse model (Table 2). Table 2. Summary of BTV vaccine studies evaluated in IFNAR(/) mouse model. baculovirus expressed proteins VP2 alone or fused to APCH ND ND Legisa et al., 2015 [152] Plant-produced protein VP2 alone or VP2 B-cell epitope sequences ND ND van Zyl et al., 2017 [153] Bacterial and baculovirus expressed proteins VP2, VP3, VP7, NS2, truncated VP5 ND ND Mohamed e IFNAR(/) mice inoculated with AHSV are highly susceptible to the virus. this mouse model has been used to study virulence, pathology, and vaccines with satisfactory results. the pathology of the AHSV infected mice closely resemble those found in AHSV-infected horses. the level of viremia was similar in animals infected with serotypes 4 and 9; however, the period of viremia was shorter when animals were infected with serotype 9. studies comparing other serotypes showed that mice infected with AHSV-4 had significantly higher AHSV RNA levels than mice infected with AHSV-1. the IFNAR(/) mice are susceptible to the infection with EHDV, in a dose-dependent manner. animals displayed clinical signs similar to those observed in BTV-infected IFNAR(/) mice with the exception of conjunctivitis. more work is needed to continue characterizing aspects of the pathology of different serotypes of EHDV. studies of viral progression in IFNAR(/) mice showed that infectious virus is recovered from the spleen, lung, thymus, lymph nodes, and blood. this shows a marked lymphoid depletion with severe white pulp lymphocytolisis and infiltration of neutrophilic infiltrates in the margin between the red and white pulp. a reduction in CD3 and CD79 (T and B cell markers, respectively) reactivity was observed in the sple changes in hematology including thrombocytopenia, neutrophilia, and lymphopenia have been determined after infection of IFNAR(/) mice with a high virulent strain of BTV-4 [66], observations similar to those described in experimental BTV infections [65,140]. a number of experimental vaccines for BTV have been tested in the mouse model based on IFNAR(/) mice. first characterization was done using a commercial inactivated vaccine that has been used in the field. the efficacy of novel recombinant subunit, DNA, and viral vector vaccines have been tested in the IFNAR(/) mouse model. muNS/MVA virus VP2, VP7, and NS1 Yes Yes Marn-L\u00f3pez et al., 2018 [149] DNA/Fowlpox virus VP2 and VP5 ND ND Li et al., 2015 [151] Baculovirus expressed proteins VP2 alone or fused to APCH ND ND Legisa et al., 2015 [152] Plant-produced protein VP2 alone or VP2 the neurotropism acquired after intracerebral passages in mice [156] and the retrograde neuroinvasion through the olfactory pathway [158]. a sc infection is a more similar route of inoculation compared with the bite of Culicoides midges in nature and IFNAR(/) mice inoculated sc with AHSV are highly susceptible to the virus. the infection of mice with ASHV-9 (PAKrrah/09) is not fatal in IFNAR(/) mice. clinical signs and viremia are present in the animals. a low dose of 102 PFUs per mouse killed all animals. a mouse model would facilitate the studies and evaluation of vaccines against this virus. the IFNAR(/) mice are susceptible to the infection with EHDV, in a dose-dependent manner. a dose of 5 105 PFUs killed all mice. the IFNAR knockout mice have served to study the role of some non-structural proteins as NSs of RFVF in the evasion of the type I IFN response. in this case, two attenuated RVFV strains with mutations in the NSs gene, MP12 and clone 13, are highly virulent in IFNAR(/) mice. the IFNAR(/) mice have defective innate immune responses, which can lead to limited adaptive immunity. many studies have shown the viability of this model to test vaccines and to study the adaptive response induced by them. model to study arbovirus transmission, pathogenesis, virulence, and protective efficacy of new antiviral strategies and new generation marker vaccines has been widely demonstrated."}
