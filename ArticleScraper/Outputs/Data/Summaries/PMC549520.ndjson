{"summary": "a tyrosine-dependent sorting signal is present in cytoplasmic tail of the spike protein of most coronaviruses. it mediates the intracellular retention of the spike protein when it is expressed on its own in vitro. the 3a protein, which is expressed during infection in vitro and in vivo, can undergo internalization. a novel coronavirus was identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. the viral genome is nearly 30 kb in length and contains 14 potential open reading frames (ORFs) these viral proteins can be broadly classified into 3 groups. the exact roles of \"accessory\" proteins of SARS-CoV are still poorly understood. in [12,13] is the largest \"accessory\" protein of SARS-CoV. it contains 274 amino acids and 3 putative transmembrane domains. antibodies against 3a were also found in convalescent patients [11,12,14] the Yxx motif has been implicated in directing protein localization to various intracellular compartments. the Yxx motif can also bind other adaptor protein complexes, like AP-1, 3 and 4. a Yxx motif in the cytoplasmic domain of 3a has previously been identified. mutagenesis studies can be used to map the protein domains that are important for the interaction between 3a and S during SARS-CoV infection. reducing the cell surface expression of S will delay this cell-damaging effect and prevent the premature release of unassembled viral RNA. a reduction in the cell surface expression of S may also help the infected cell evade the host defense system and reduce the production of anti-S neutralizing antibodies. however, host or viral factors that disrupt the interaction between S and 3a would favor the expression of S on the cell surface and enhance cell-cell fusion. reticulum retrieval signal in the cytoplasmic tail of IBV was reported to be important for intracellular retention of S [28]. amino acid sequences of the cytoplasmic tail of spike (S) proteins of coronaviruses are compared with the Yxx motifs found in cellular proteins known to undergo endocytosis. yxxx tetrapeptides are underlined and abbreviations used are: TM, transmembrane domain, aa, amino acids. cS proteins of group 2 coronaviruses: BCoV, bovine coronavirus (AF220295), HCoV-NL63, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-NL63, AY518894. human coronavirus OC43 (AY585228), MHV, porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (AF201929), MHV, murine hepatitis virus (AF201929), MHV, rat coronavirus (AF207551), HCoV-HKU1, human coronavirus HKU1 (AY597011), SARS-CoV, SARS coronavirus (AY283798) author's contributions Yee-Joo Tan is responsible for the entire manuscript."}
