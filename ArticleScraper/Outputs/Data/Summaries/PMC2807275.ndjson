{"summary": "infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious viral disease of chickens with a worldwide distribution. it is characterized by respiratory symptoms, nephritis, poor performance and reduced egg reproduction. phylogenetic analysis revealed that Korean field isolates of IBV constitute at least three distinct phylogenetic types. strains KM91 and Kr/Q43/06 were analyzed. pathogenicity of strain was determined using specific pathogen free chickens. all birds in the control group were monitored daily for 14 days. cross virus neutralization tests were performed using anti-sera against strains KM91, Kr/Q43/06 and H120. strain Kr/Q43/06 effectively neutralized by antiserum to the homologous strain. strains KM91 and H120 were unable to effectively neutralize strain Kr/Q43/06. NI values were converted to antigenic relatedness (R value) using the following formula created by archetti and Horsfall. KM91 is the first report of a new antigenic variant of nephropathogenic IBV in chickens from Korea. it is the first report of a new antigenic variant of nephropathogenic IBV in chickens. currently available IBV vaccines do not provide cross-protection against new variant strains that emerge in the field. the development of alternative vaccines should be considered for the effective control of IB in Korea."}
