{"summary": "virulence in plant pathogens has been investigated from a predominantly agro-centric perspective. the evolution of virulence in plant pathogens has been investigated from a predominantly agro-centric perspective. we present numerous examples of virulence traits in plant pathogenic microorganisms that also have a function in their survival and growth in nonagricultural and nonplant habitats. virulence factors of human pathogens in environmental reservoirs have begun to reveal the importance of alternate hosts, of dual-use virulence factors. studies of virulence factors of human pathogens in environmental reservoirs have begun to reveal the importance of alternate hosts. virulence factors of human pathogens in environmental reservoirs have begun to reveal the importance of alternate hosts. dual-use traits include melanin, laccase, phospholipase, proteases, and ureases. fungus often found in soils that contain high levels of bird guano and in association with certain plants. burkholderia cenocepacia Quorum-sensing regulatory system Regulation of virulence factors implicated in \u201ccepacia syndrome\u201d Regulation of factors involved in nematode killing [62] Yersinia pestis Extracellular polysaccharide production linked to the action of heme storage gene (hms) products Transmission to the human host and protection from the action of leukocytes Colonization of flea esophagus via bio the eco-evo approach to understanding the emergence of pathogens gives credence, from the perspective of genomics, to evolutionary and adaptive scenarios that are surmised from a thorough understanding of the ecology and life history of pathogens. many of the virulence factors of these plant pathogens are linked to\u2014or are in themselves\u2014traits critical to adaptation to the nonplant environment. abiotic stresses play as important a role in the evolution of parasitic fitness of plant pathogens as it does for human pathogens. examples of plant pathogens reported to thrive in nonagricultural habitats or to survive saprophytically in agricultural contexts in the absence of host plants. most Alternaria species are common saprophytes; found in soil or decaying plant tissues and atmospheric aerosols Derive energy as a result of cellulytic activity. production of toxic secondary metabolites. production of toxins including aflatoxins. toxins and toxin transport systems are among the common adaptations for antagonizing and defending against the co-inhabitants of a habitat. the efflux pump BcAtrB of Botrytis cinerea confers resistance to antimicrobials produced by soil and plant microflora. many plant pathogenic bacteria produce efflux pumps that are involved in their resistance to plant antimicrobials. mycotoxins have broad spectrum activity and are thought to have evolved as a defense against predators (nematodes) and antagonists (other microorganisms) siderophores contribute to resistance to oxidative stress and sequestering iron when it is rare in the environment. toxins and siderophores are produced by nonribosomal peptide synthase or polyketide synthase pathways. the capacity to detect changes in conditions of the abiotic environment has also become part of the virulence factors of some plant pathogens. for example, organisms exploit two-component histidine kinase complexes to detect changes in environmental conditions. stress is considered to play an important role in adaptive evolution in general, in particular via its effect on mutation rates. s in the rhizosphere are food substrates and means of communication, antagonism, and collaboration among microorganisms, among plants and microorganisms. pectolytic, cellulolytic, and lignolytic enzymes are also well-known pathogenicity factors [37]\u2013[39] to hone the efficiency of these enzymes in planta. pathogenic bacteria include flagella, motility, lipo- and exo- polysaccharides, O-antigens, fimbriae, mechanisms for iron acquisition and for quorum sensing, toxin production, cell wall\u2013degrading enzymes, and resistance to oxidative stress. elicitins are part of one of the most conserved protein families in the Phytophthora genus and are widespread throughout Phytophthora species. elicitins is the acquisition of sterols from the environment. the evolutionary forces that have been described to date for plant pathogens [56] need to be extended beyond the current agro-centric paradigm. studies of pathogen ecology, evolution, and life history should be reconsidered. the consequences of these mutations for pathogenicity might be markedly different than for fitness in nonagricultural habitats. the formation of spores or aggregates that can be released into the air might be highly influenced by the nature of the reservoir that the pathogen colonizes. however, the complexity of the biotic and abiotic environment perceived by obligate biotrophs during colonization of plants may exert selection independent of that due to the host plant genotype per se. the effective sub-population size of a pathogen associated with a given nonagricultural substrate is significantly different from that for sub-populations from cultivated host plants. this could lead to genetic and/or phenotypic differentiation of sub-populations based on substrate of origin. the cost of virulence in terms of fitness in association with plants has been explored extensively for several obligate parasites such as rusts and powdery mildews. for nonobligate pathogens we do not know the cost of fitness outside of agricultural habitats. the interplay between evolutionary forces and habitat has not been explored for plant pathogens."}
