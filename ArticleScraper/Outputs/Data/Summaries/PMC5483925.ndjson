{"summary": "mycoplasma pneumoniae is a significant cause of respiratory illness, including pneumonia (1, 2). there is limited epidemiological data on the frequency with which this atypical pathogen causes community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in Thailand. the paucity of knowledge can be attributed to the specialized expertise required to isolate and culture this fastidious pathogen. the current report describes laboratory detection and characterization of M. pneumoniae collected during population-based surveillance for influenza-like illness in two rural provinces, Nakhon Phanom and Sa Kaeo. a total of 175/3,000 (5.8%) hospitalized patients were positive by real-time PCR. the incidence of M. pneumoniae infection for rural areas of Thailand was calculated at an average of 4.6 cases per 100,000 persons per year over the study period. a peak incidence was seen in 2010 with 6.1 cases per 100,000 population, with incidences of 3.3 and 3.4 in 2009 and 2011 respectively. 0.932 Dyspnea 99 (57.9) 1,683 (61.2) 0.39 Rhonchi 37 (38.9) 704 (41.9) 0.573 Crepitation 48 (50.5) 867 (51.6) 0.838 Leukocytosis (WBCb of >11,000) 67 (39.0) 1,264 (45.9) 0.094 CXRc with evidence of pneumonia 109 (63.4) 1,824 (68.6) 0.149 Required O2 supplementation 83 the discharge diagnosis for 62/175 (35.4%) patients was pneumonia followed by upper respiratory tract infection in 28/175 (16%) patients. the most commonly identified virus was influenza A in 7.3% (219/3,000) of specimens across all ages. yncytial virus 9 134 3 6 0 6 1 8 3 31 No. adenovirus 4 37 0 3 1 5 0 3 1 7 No. influenza A virus 1 59 4 42 2 30 1 29 2 49 No. human metapneumovirus 1\u20134b 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Total infections (no.) Figure 1 shows the number of M. pneumoniae PCR-positive cases by month and year. the monthly incidence peaked in September in both 2009 and 2010. in 2009, no cases were identified from January through April, whereas in 2011 this shifted back by 1 month. the type 1 genotype was determined for 157 (89.7%) of the PCR-positive specimens. it could not be evaluated for 18 specimens because of poor amplification of the target sequence from the primary specimen. the type 1 genotype accounted for 97/157 detections across all age groups. profilea 141 68 73 0.294 67 74 0.329 Resistant 0 0 0 Profiles could not be determined for 18 M. pneumoniae-positive specimens because of poor amplification of target sequence from the specimen. only 110/149 specimens tested (62.9% of the total number of positives) showed positive amplification for all four MLVA loci. MLVA type 4/5/7/2 predominated during 2010, followed by type shift to MLVA 3/5/6/2 in 2011. the macrolide susceptibility profile was determined for 141/175 (80.6%) specimens. none of these demonstrated the predominant mutations associated with resistance to macrolides (A2063G or A2064G in the 23S rRNA gene) (13) adenovirus 4 37 0 3 1 5 0 3 1 7 No. influenza B virus/respiratory syncytial virus codetection 0 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 Total infections (no.) 17 263 8 73 3 51 2 44 8 102 Total infections (%) 30.9 26.8 27.6 26.0 13.0 14.7 9.1 10.9 17.3 12.5 a comparison between the two participants shows no statistically significant differences. hemoculture performed at physician request resulta M. pneumoniae positive (n = 175) M. pneumoniae negative (n = 2,825) No. of hemocultures performed 65 (37.1) 944 (33.4) no significant differences in proportion of specimens in which codetections were identified between sites. over the study period, we did not see a discrete seasonality to M. pneumoniae cases; however, there was a slight increase in cases 1 to 2 months after the start of the rainy season. the type 1 genotype accounted for 97/157 (61.8%) detections across all age groups, with 32.5% in children 18 years old and 29.3% in adults.

MLVA types were described using four of the five loci in two PCRs. all specimens for this study were from patients enrolled in active public health surveillance of influenza-like illness conducted in all district (16), military (2) (10 to 140 inpatient beds), and provincial (2) hospitals (225 to 327 beds) the patients who met the active respiratory infection case definition were reported as having either fever or chills with a documented temperature of >38.2\u00b0C or 35.2\u00b0C within 24 h of admission. xth specimen in the list was systematically drawn from the specimen bank. total nucleic acid was extracted from 200 l of UTM from each swab specimen. eluted into 100 l using the EZ1 advanced XL virus minikit v2.0. 2063 or 2064 of the 23S gene of M. pneumoniae was detected by a PCR approach followed by high resolution melt analysis reactions. all unknown specimens were tested alongside known macrolide-resistant and macrolide-sensitive reference strains for accurate comparison."}
