{"summary": "severe sepsis and septic shock still represent a leading cause of ICU admission with a case fatality rate of 30\u201340%. systemic inflammation, surrounding multiorgan failure, results from a maladaptive unbalance between early antimicrobial immune reactions and uncontrolled local infection and inflammation. small amounts of this protein are produced in other organs (kidney, thymus, tonsil, small intestine, and vagina) MBL harbors a carbohydrate recognition domain (CRD) through which it binds to specific carbohydrates exposed on pathogenic agents surface. subsequently MASPs are able to trigger the lectin complement pathway cleaving C4 and C2 to form C3 convertase. three points mutations involve the exon 1, identifying alleles B (Codon 54), C (Codon 57), and D (Codon 52). many SNPs may affect the promoter region and determine low MBL protein serum levels and activity. these polymorphisms determine the production of unstable proteins, with shorter half-life. tic levels ranging between 500 and 1000 ng/mL are generally detected in heterozygous patients (A/O genotype); instead homozygous variant MBL2 alleles usually present very low concentrations (50 ng/mL) sporadic reports have not found a clear association between MBL deficiency and increased rate of infectious episodes. prevalence of mutations in one or both MBL2 gene alleles is relevant, ranging between 30% and 40% in analyzed populations [13, 27] the role of this lectin is particularly relevant when adaptive immune system is immature or compromised [30] increased susceptibility and worse outcome in 212 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) were also observed in presence of MBL2 gene polymorphisms. the presence of MBL2 gene B variant was associated with increased risk of Coronavirus infection. polymorphisms of this gene were observed in seven of ten white patients with chronic necrotizing aspergillosis compared with 25% of controls. variations of MBL plasmatic levels seem to correlate with the occurrence of invasive candidiasis. the influence of complement activation on septic shock development was largely investigated. many studies have shown how classical and alternative pathways are activated during septic shock. this role has been more recently studied also for lectin complement activation due to MBL. pretreatment of MBL-null mice with rhMBL increased survival rate of about 50%. this deficiency was associated with early occurrence of DIC and liver injury after S. aureus inoculation. this suggests the role of this protein in the development of organ failure and systemic coagulation activation during severe infections. a population-based prospective study performed in greenland on almost 300 Eskimo children. both heterozygous and homozygous subjects, aged 6 to 17 months, for variant alleles presented a twofold increased risk of acute respiratory infections, including pneumonia. the results indicated that lower MBL levels during fetal inflammatory response syndrome were associated with higher risk of sepsis development independently from gestational age and birth weight. in a cohort of 94 children treated with chemotherapy for cancer, MASP-2 deficit (200 ng/mL) significantly increased the risk of febrile neutropenia and bacteraemia development. in a cohort of 195 adult septic patients, MBL deficiency resulted independently being associated with higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at day 3, suggesting its role as a risk factor for the development of severe sepsis. a well-conducted prospective study investigated the MBL genetic and plasmatic profile in a population of 272 critically ill ICU patients with documented SIRS. 172 patients met the criteria for severe sepsis and 70 for septic shock. compared with noninfectious SIRS, these patients shared the carriage of MBL variants alleles and low serum levels according to the severity of disease. authors define a MBL cutoff value of 0.5 mcg/mL as a reliable predictor of low producing status. they confirmed that MBL deficiency significantly increased the risk of death due to severe infection, also in ICU setting. invasive candidiasis remains a leading cause of death due to infections in critically ill patients. serum MBL levels were measured in 68 patients with proven IC, 82 hospitalized not infected patients, and 70 healthy subjects. several mouse experiments support the role of MBL deficiency in severe infections, especially after bacteria inoculation. two functional MBL genes exist in the mouse and the generation of double knockout gene-deficient mice has increased the investigations in this field. deficient mice models without the capability to activate MBL-independent lectin cascade are more susceptible to develop severe systemic pneumococcal infections. some authors have observed how deficient mice models are more susceptible to develop severe systemic pneumococcal infections. however, these observations may not be considered conclusive. in a cohort of 94 children treated with chemo for cancer, MASP-2 deficit (200 ng/mL) significantly increased the risk of febrile neutropenia and bacteraemia development. in a cohort of 195 adult septic patients, MBL deficiency resulted independently being associated with higher sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score at day 3. compared with healthy subjects, MBL deficient patients were at increased risk of sepsis, with a significant higher mortality rate in presence of levels below 1000 ng/mL. a well-conducted prospective study, performed in Denmark, investigated the MBL genetic and plasmatic profile in a population of 272 critically ill ICU patients. 848 patients affected by community-acquired pneumonia were compared with 1447 healthy control subjects. 519 patients without relevant infectious diseases were equally distributed among those subjects. authors defined a MBL cutoff value of 0.5 mcg/mL as a reliable predictor of low producing status. the correlation between MBL2 gene polymorphisms and the outcome of Escherichia coli pyelonephritis was investigated in a well-conducted prospective study. the authors identified a marked decrease in its plasmatic levels during the first days of infection in association with mannans increase. a similar pharmacokinetic profile was observed in 20 healthy MBL-deficient volunteers and two patients with Staphylococcus Aureus septicemia [71]. a similar pharmacokinetic profile was observed in 20 healthy MBL-deficient volunteers and two patients with Staphylococcus Aureus septicemia."}
