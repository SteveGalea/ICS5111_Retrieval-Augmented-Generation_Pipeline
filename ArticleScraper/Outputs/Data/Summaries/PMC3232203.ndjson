{"summary": "Rift Valley fever virus causes disease in livestock and humans. it can be transmitted by mosquitoes, inhalation or physical contact with the body fluids of infected animals. the dynamics of RVFV infection and cell types infected in vivo are poorly understood. Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) is an arthropod-borne member of the Bunyaviridae family. the virus can be transmitted by Aedes and Culex mosquitoes. it can also be transmitted by inhalation or physical contact with the body fluids from infected animals. in outbred Swiss mice, survival time was inversely proportional to the logarithm of the viral dose inoculated via the intravenous route. males from various inbred strains of mice inoculated by the peritoneal route with 102 PFU of the virulent Egyptian ZH548 strain die between 4 to 10 days after inoculation. ed RNA genome with large (L), medium (M) and small (S) segments encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the M segment the two virion glycoproteins (GN and GC) and the NSm nonstructural proteins, and the S segment the N nucleoprotein and the NSs nonstructural protein. recombinant RVFV RNA genome segments are expressed under the control of either the cellular DNA-dependent RNA polymerase I in mice that are nonresponsive to type I IFN, virus expressing either hRLuc or GFP caused lethality within 3 days. in these mice, virus infection could be tracked by luciferase imaging in live animals. plasmid pPol I-SZHNSs carries two BbsI cloning sites in place of NSs. humanized Renilla reniformis luciferase sequence was inserted in pPol I-SZHNSs to give pPol I-SZHNSs-hRLuc plasmid. vero E6 cells were infected with rZHNS-GFP and rZHNSs-hRLuc. the supernatant was collected and stored at 80\u00b0C. at 72 h post-infection, the supernatant was collected and the viral suspension was titered. the cells were incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with a mouse anti-N antibody diluted in 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) the cells were then incubated for 25 min at 37\u00b0C with the secondary antibody Alexa Fluor 555 goat anti-mouse (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). mice were anesthetized and injected with 100 L h-coelenterazine (1 mg/ml) h-coelenterazine stock solution was solubilized in ethanol-propylene glycol solution (11) at 10 mg/ml. one HEPA filter was connected to an air pump, thus allowing air renewal during the imaging. a signal was considered significant if its intensity was at least twofold higher than the background luminescence in the mock-infected mouse. a signal was considered significant if its intensity was at least twofold higher than the background luminescence in the mock-infected mouse. the size of the amplification product was 108 pb. a standard curve was generated using duplicates of serial dilutions of RNA of the M segment ranging from 109 to 102 copies. rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32, clone 2.4G2 antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Jos\u00e9, CA) was used to block non-antigen-specific binding of immunoglobulins to Fc-receptors. cells were stained using combination of the following antibodies. cytometer (BD Biosciences) and data analysis was performed using cellQuest (BD Biosciences) and FlowJo (Ashland, OR) softwares. fluorescence compensation settings for multicolor flow cytometric analysis were optimized based on single-stained polystyrene microparticles. all staining procedures were conducted on ice. fluorescence data were obtained and analyzed using MACSQuant Analyzer and MACSQuantify software (Miltenyi Biotec) ulent pPol I-LZH, pPol I-MZH, and pPol I-SZH were cloned in the plasmid pRF108, [24], [36]. the humanized Renilla reniformis luciferase sequence from phRL-SV40 was inserted in pPol I-SZHNSs to give pPol I-SZHNSs-hRLuc plasmi rZHNS-GFP and rZHNSs-hRLuc cells were infected with the rescued virus at a MOI of 0.001 and 0.01 respectively. at 72 h post-infection, the supernatant was collected and the viral suspension was titered. hyde in PBS, permeabilized for 10 min with 0.5% Triton X100 in PBS. cells were next incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with a mouse anti-N antibody diluted in 5% BSA in PBS (dilution 1800), washed with 5% BSA in PBS and then in water. h-coelenterazine stock solution was solubilized in ethanol-propylene glycol solution (11) at 10 mg/ml. h-coelenterazine-treated mice were placed in a hermetically sealed light-tight-transparent chamber equipped with two HEPA filters. a mock-infected mouse was used as a negative control. a signal was considered significant if its intensity was twofold higher than the background luminescence in the mock-infected mouse. after the last imaging time point, mice were euthanized. the size of the amplification product was 108 pb. a standard curve was generated using duplicates of 10-fold serial dilutions of RNA of the M segment. rat anti-mouse CD16/CD32, clone 2.4G2 antibody (BD Pharmingen, San Jos\u00e9, CA) was used to block non-antigen-specific binding of immunoglobulins to Fc-receptors. all staining procedures were conducted on ice. 4% formaldehyde was measured using a FACSAria II flow cytometer. data analysis was performed using cellQuest and FlowJo softwares. conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD11c (BD Pharmingen) and Pacific Blue-conjugated rat anti-mouse Ly6G/Gr-1 (eBioscience.com) all staining procedures were conducted on ice. challenge with 104 PFU rZHNS-hRLuc was performed by injection into the ear, 24 h after liposome treatment. luciferase activity was measured using coelenterazine, a specific substrate of Renilla luciferase, and found to be expressed at significant levels from 2 h post-infection onwards. uninfected Vero E6 cells showed no luciferase activity. this is consistent with previous reports [31], [32]. rZHNSs-hRLuc infected Ifnar1/ mice died within 45 h from severe hepatitis with no signs of neurological disorder. infections of Ifnar1/ mice with rZHNSs or with Clone 13 gave similar results. the recombinant rZHNSs-GFP was harvested from the liver of an infected Ifnar1/ mouse at 34 h post-infection. the percentage of cells positive for the N viral protein that were also GFP-positive was measured. the percentage of cells positive for the N viral protein that were also GFP-positive was measured. animals were euthanized for ex vivo imaging, the organs of the thorax and abdomen were harvested. in the thorax, the greatest signal originated from the thymus. in the abdomen, the pancreas was the most luminescent organ. the spleen and the liver also emitted significant luminescence. this suggests that the liver was not among the main replication sites for RVFV at this early stage of infection. five Ifnar1-deficient mice were infected i.p. with 104 PFU rZHNSs-hRluc. luciferase levels of the liver, thymus and pancreas during time course of infection. luminescence profiles were increased in the liver and pancreas. imaging of the liver (A), thymus (B) and pancreas (C) was performed in living mice at 8, 16 and 34 h post-infection by defining regions-of-interests (ROIs) results are given as photon/s/cm2/steradian and plotted as the mean and standard error of the mean of photon counts over time. the ability of h\u2013coelenterazine to cross the blood-brain barrier is unknown. light emission increased through 16 h and 34 h post-infection to reach 7105 and 7106 p/sec/cm2/sr. luminescence was first visible in the neck on the side of the ear pinna. the neck signal came from the lymph nodes draining the ear. at 40 h post-infection, organs in the abdominal cavity, including the pancreas and the liver were highly luminescent. images (A) and (B) are representative of five mice. images were overlaid with false colour representation of bioluminescence intensity, measured in photon/s/cm2/sr and indicated on the scales. identification of hematopoietic target cells by immunohistochemistry and flow cytometry. macrophages appeared as important cell targets for replication of RVFV-hRLuc in wild-type mice. macrophages containing intracytoplasmic viral antigens were observed in the sinus of the pancreaticoduodenal lymph node. multifocal lesion centered on the mesentery, sparing the pancreatic tissue. no viral immunolabeling is detected in the endocrine and exocrine components. Ifnar1-deficient mice were either infected i.p. with 104 PFU rZHNSs-GFP (N = 6) or mock-treated (N = 5). at this time point, 0.54% of the total hematopoietic cell population of the spleen from rZHNS-GFP-infected mice expressed GFP. the percentage of GFP-expressing cells within the total cell population of spleen varied from one infected mice to another. however, each of the three subsets of immune cells was infected with the same efficiency in the different mice. this is shown by the fact that the ratio of GFP-expressing macrophages, dendritic cells or granulocytes was highly correlated. in a new tab Mice were either infected i.p. with 104 PFU rZHNSs-GFP or mock-treated (control) and euthanized 24 h after infection. a total number of 100,000 to 450,000 splenic cells of infected animals was collected and analyzed. clodronate-loaded liposomes are widely used to deliver clodronate to phagocytic cells, especially macrophages. the accumulation of clodronate leads to irreversible metabolic damages, which will eventually result in apoptosis. i.p. administration of CLL kills macrophages in the peritoneum and spleen of wild-type mice. Ifnar1-deficient mice were infected intradermally with 104 PFU rZHNSs-hRLuc at 24 h after liposome administration. the profile of bioluminescence signals was similar in PBSL- and CLL-administered mice (N = 5 in each group) however, we observed weaker signals in CLL-administered mice. d mice (N = 12) showed no sign of encephalitis and succumbed to hepatitis. these observations confirmed the crucial role of monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells during RVFV infection in Ifnar1/ mice. the rescued rZHNSs-hRLuc was amplified in vero E6 cells. the plaques formed by rZHNSs-hRLuc were fuzzy with a faint staining inside. to test the luciferase expression within the infected cells, vero E6 cells were infected at a MOI of either 0.3 or 3. 129S2/SvPas mice deficient for IFN-/ receptor subunit 1 (Ifnar1/) (N = 5) were infected i.p. with 104 PFU of rZHNSs-hRLuc. all wild-type mice survived the infection for 13 days with no signs of disease. the amplification product sizes were those expected from the structure of pPolI-SZHNSs-hRLuc and pPolI-SZHNSs-GFP plasmids. no amplification products with smaller sizes were observed, suggesting that the recombinant viruses maintained their own genomic stability. the percentage of cells positive for the N viral protein that were also GFP-positive was measured. we observed strong signals between the forelegs in the thoracic cavity, and below the xiphoid cartilage in the abdominal cavity, respectively. in some experiments, animals were euthanized for ex vivo imaging, the organs of the thorax and abdomen were harvested, and the individual organs were imaged. a ten-fold higher luminescence signal was observed in the harvested pancreas compared to the liver. at 34 h post-infection, the intensity of the signal led to saturation of the camera using a 0.5 s integration period. other organs with intense luminescence were the spleen, intestine mesentery and pancreas. five Ifnar1-deficient mice were infected i.p with 104 PFU rZHNSs-hRLuc. imaging of the liver (A), thymus (B) and pancreas was performed in living mice at 8, 16 and 34 h post-infection. the light emission was measured in the harvested pancreas (B), spleen (C) and liver (D) by imaging. each cross represents an individual organ. results are given as the number of RNA copies per gram of organ (x axis) rZHNSs-hRLuc can be transmitted through injection of infectious saliva from mosquito into the dermis or direct inhalation from body fluids, such as blood of infected animals [2], [3]. to approximate these natural routes of infection, we compared the light production after intraperitoneal, intradermal or intranasal inoculation of 104 PFU rZHNSs-hRLuc into Ifnar1/ mice. images (A) and (B) are representative of five mice. images were overlaid with false colour representation of bioluminescence intensity. identification of hematopoietic target cells by immunohistochemistry. in the pancreas, no histological lesions were found in the exocrine or endocrine components. in the pancreas, no histological lesions were found in the exocrine or endocrine components. however, a multifocal inflammatory lesion was observed in the mesentery around pancreatic acini (peritonitis) macrophages displayed a hyperbasophilic and condensed nucleus. morphological change is characteristic for irreversible cell injury. macrophages are important cell targets of the RVFV. recombinant virus rZHNSs-GFP carries GFP in place of the NSs gene. cells infected with rZHNSs-GFP are fluorescent upon excitation at 488 nm. b+ MHC II+ (dendritic cells) [44] and CD11b+ CD11c Ly6G+ (granulocytes) on average 5.58% (range 2.15\u20138.71%), 4.5% (range 0.82\u20138.49%) and 1.96% (range 0.05\u20136.07%) cells expressed GFP. the percentage of GFP-expressing cells within the total cell population of spleen varied from one infected mice to another. at 24 h post-infection, RVFV replicated in cells of the myeloid lineage. Mice were either infected i.p. with 104 PFU rZHNSs-GFP or mock-treated (control) and euthanized 24 h after infection. a total number of 100,000 to 450,000 splenic cells of infected animals was collected and analyzed. 1,700 dendritic cells, 1,500 macrophages, 1,600 granulocytes, 200,000 B lymphocytes, 3,000 NK cells, and 100,000 T lymphocytes. i.p. administration of CLL kills macrophages in the peritoneum and spleen of wild-type mice whereas i.v. administration affects mostly macrophages in the spleen and liver. spleen macrophages and blood monocytes were depleted 24 h after CLL treatment. granulocytes and dendritic cells were not affected by clodronate treatment. PBSL- and PBSL-administered mice were infected intradermally. similar observations were made at 40 h post-infection (6.31053.7105 vs. 2.61072.2107 PFU/ml, Mann-Whitney test, P = 0.0495; P = 0.0039 when data from both time points were combined) the PBSL-treated mice (N = 12) survived for a longer period of time after challenge than the PBSL-treated mice (N = 12) the recombinant viruses were generated by replacing the NSs gene with the reporter gene. they were highly pathogenic in mice lacking interferon-/ receptor. the pancreas appeared as an unexpected site of virus replication. peritoneal macrophages from susceptible rats have been previously documented. this is the first study to evaluate the infection rates of various subsets of cells of the myeloid lineage in vivo. this is, to our knowledge, the first study to evaluate the infection rates of various subsets of cells. RVFV is thought to be transmitted primarily by bites of infected mosquitoes, by direct contact with infected body fluids or through airborne transmission. it has been confirmed that exposure of mice to RVFV is able to induce infection. we infected wild-type 129S2/SvPas with the virulent RVFV ZH548 strain. however, we failed to identify the peritonitis seen repeatedly in recombinant Ifnar1/ mice. this suggests that cells of the macrophage lineage displayed an increase susceptibility to RVFV compared to wild-type mice. Ifnar1/mice have proven to be a tractable system in which to study the progression of RVFV infection in vivo. however, the immunocompromised nature of this mutant strain remains a limitation in translating these results directly to wild-type mice. additional work needs to be done to develop similar whole-organ imaging and flow cytometry analysis in immune-competent mice."}
