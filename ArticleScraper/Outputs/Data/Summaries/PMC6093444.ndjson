{"summary": "the Pathways Service at the Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) is a new initiative, led by Mark Fishman, MD and Katrina Armstrong, MD. the initiative is based on the belief that curiosity driven by a single patient with a clear-cut and unexplained constellation of disorders can generate new insights into disease mechanism. the initiative is led by two former residents who died tragically in an avalanche during training. in 1 year, more than 75 inpatients have been referred to the Pathways service. the team will develop 1 or more hypotheses regarding the pathophysiology underlying the patient\u2019s disorder. the team will consult on a patient with an unexplained disorder and develop 1 or more hypotheses. the Bigelow Service is comprised of 4 interns, a junior assistant resident, and 2 attending physicians who oversee the care of 16\u201318 patients. each Bigelow team is comprised of 4 interns, a junior assistant resident, and 2 attending physicians who oversee the care of 16\u201318 patients. physician-scientists from the department of medicine, including infectious diseases, serve as role models for trainees. they can use interstices of their daily schedule to excite residents and students about a career in investigation. the ability to carry a smaller list of patients allows younger physician-scientists to engage rather than actively exclude clinical work in the early part of their careers. residents are exposed to a broad array of investigators in the MGH community at all stages of their careers. residents present their projects to faculty mentors and program leadership on the final day of the course. the lifeblood of research-oriented academic medical centers are the physician-scientists. a concerted effort to ensure a steady supply of these investigation-oriented physicians is critical to the long-term success of biomedical research. many challenges exist in the training environment."}
