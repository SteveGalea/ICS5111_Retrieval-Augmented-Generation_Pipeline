{"summary": "resistance to death is a major characteristic of cancer cell. cell death plays a major role in the homeostasis of tissues. resistance to cell death during tumorigenesis may also explain tumor relapse following chemotherapeutic treatment. cell death can be approached from a variety of viewpoints, including measurement of dead cells (cytotoxicity assay), quantification of live cells (viability assay), and, ultimately, determination of the accurate mechanism involved. a single method may not be sufficient to determine a type of cell death. extrinsic apoptosis is activated by extracellular stress signals and is characterized by death receptors that induce a caspase signaling cascade involving caspase 8 or caspase 9. the entire process is highly regulated and leads ultimately to massive cell destruction without an inflammatory response. potential immunogenic cell death inducers have been characterized and include some chemotherapies as well as radiotherapy. autophagic cell death involves the formation of double membrane which contains vacuoles. this sequestrated cytoplasm is digested through the fusion with lysosome vacuoles. autophagy may constitute an epiphenomenon of cell death that could be analyzed as an unsuccessful attempt by cells to cope with stress. apoptosis and autophagy can display synergetic effects, whereas autophagy can be activated when apoptosis is suppressed. the complex relationship between these modalities requires the use of different protocols to measure and identify the type of cell death. the interrelation between cell death processes appears to be more complex than initially anticipated. the dye exclusion assay with trypan blue is widely used in routine laboratory work. blue-stained cells are dead cells and the percentage of viable cells is calculated as ratio of viable and total number of enumerated cells. other dyes such as calcein acetoxymethyl ester can be used to selectively label living cells. method involves labeled DNA precursors that are introduced into cells before the measurement of DNA incorporation, after incubation. the occurrence of cell division in vitro is associated with DNA incorporation through a proportional relationship. the presence of biomarker activity is typically proof positive for the presence of cytotoxicity. a simplified assay has been described which allows same-well measurement of LDH without the need for sampling. a major inconvenience of these techniques is that physicochemical factors such as variations in the culture medium, ie, pH, may affect the activity of these enzymes. adenosine triphosphate is produced by living cells and is a sine qua non condition to cellular life. the most sensitive microplate assay available for detecting viable cells in culture as less than 10 cells per well can be labeled. however, decreased intracellular ATP concentrations may result from nonlethal perturbations, including cessation of proliferation and inhibited mitochondrial respiration. the measurement of metabolic activity can be achieved using tetrazolium salt as dead cells cannot metabolize the substance. cytotoxicity reflects the cell-killing property of a chemical compound. cell proliferation is the measurement of the number of cells that are dividing in a culture. a myriad of assays have been designed and used so as to measure viability. permeability assays are a quick and inexpensive method to assess cell death. it is unable to discriminate between different modes of cell death. the issue of cell death with an intact membrane could underestimate cellular damage. adenylate kinase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase are other cellular enzymes that can also be used as cell death markers even if a loss in their activity can occur during cell death assays. this is why cell death assays based on LDH activity are more effective than other enzyme-based cell death assays. luciferase-based assays are amenable to HTS studies. it is based on the ability of firefly luciferase to generate a luminescent signal. the ATP assay is the most sensitive microplate assay available for detecting viable cells in culture. apoptosis involves caspase activation, cleavage of cellular protein substrates, cleavage of DNA into size fragments, and formation of apoptotic bodies. caspase activity in a cell during apoptosis leads to the cleavage of specific substrates that can later be easily detected as a marker of caspase activation. a real-time assessment of caspase activity may then be allowed, thanks to substrates that are bifunctional compounds. annexin-V derivatives associated with different fluorochromes can be used for apoptosis measurement using multicolor flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. dUTP nick end labeling technique based on the formation of endonuclease-generated DNA breaks that are labeled by terminal transferase with uridine triphosphate derivatives coupled with fluorochromes. gene fragmentation is evaluated quantitatively by fluorescence microscopy or by flow cytometry. autophagy inhibitors are considered potent chemosensitizers. luciferase coupled with LC3 has recently been used to develop a real-time HTS-compatible assay for monitoring the autophagic flux. necrosis can be defined as a mass of dead cells and does not depend from a specific cell death pathway. if secondary necrosis represents the end point of all cell death modalities, primary necrosis constitutes an entire cell death mechanism with specific characteristics. the best way to detect necroptosis is the analysis of a crucial kinase activation: receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1). CYPA-oriented assays and HMGB1 assays should be adapted to HTS assays for detecting necroptosis. current research focuses on the development of inducers through vaccination assays with immunodeficient mice reconstituted with a human immune system. assay suitable for high-throughput screening protocol Implementation in 96- or 384-well plates Physicochemical factors affect the activity of the measured enzymes Lack of specificity concerning the type of death Metabolism-based assays (ATP) Easy Non time-consuming Technique of choice Tests compounds do not interfere with fluorescent assay methods Variations in intracellular ATP concentrations can result from nonlethal perturbations Risk of metabolic interferences and false-positive results Preliminary information only Apoptosis assays: ATP, adenosine triphosphate, CYPA, cyclophilin A; ELISA, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay; HMGB1, high-mobility group box 1; HTS, high-throughput screening; LC3, light chain 3; LDH, lactate dehydrogenase; MMD, mitochondrial membrane depolarization; MOMP, mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization; and RIP1, receptor-interacting protein 1. antibodies that only detect caspase-cleaved form of a substrate protein with site-specific cleavage. caspase activation can be assessed by other reagents that are compatible with HTS applications. annexin-V derivatives associated with different fluorochromes can be used for apoptosis measurement using multicolor flow cytometry or fluorescence microscopy. a gel electrophoresis of genomic DNA was used for demonstrating internucleosomal DNA fragmentation. necrotic cells show a smear of randomly degraded DNA, but it has been superseded by faster and easier methods. the terminal dUTP nick end labeling technique is widely used to study and measure DNA fragmentation. autophagy inhibitors are considered potent chemosensitizers. luciferase coupled with LC3 has recently been used to develop a real-time HTS-compatible assay for monitoring the autophagic flux. necrosis can be defined as a mass of dead cells and does not depend from a specific cell death pathway. if secondary necrosis represents the end point of all cell death modalities, primary necrosis constitutes an entire cell death mechanism with specific characteristics. peptidylprolyl isomerase A, also known as cyclophilin A, appears to be specifically released from necroptotic cells. CYPA-oriented assay kits and HMGB1 assays should be adapted to HTS assays for detecting necroptosis. lipophilic properties of certain dyes interact with cell death\u2013unrelated process Colony formation assays Reliable method Time-consuming Laborious Only for a limited number of samples Intracellular protein release assays are commercially and easily available Simplified assay suitable for high-throughput screening protocol Implementation in 96- or 384-well plates Physicochemical factors affect the activity of the measured enzymes Lack of specificity concerning the type of death Metabolism-based assays (ATP) Easy the correct evaluation of cell death in every experimental setting related to cancer research is a must and advocate for a real cell death characterization. this crucial assessment leads to chemotherapeutic approaches for targeting specific cell death pathways, and several novel drugs are being tested in clinic. several clinical trials that evaluate target therapies in sarcomas regarding apoptosis and mitotic catastrophe are still ongoing. the induction of this form of death through nanocarrier-based drug delivery systems may lead to potential therapy in pancreatic cancer. elaborating potential drugs that could interfere with these specific mechanisms are the main framework for progress."}
