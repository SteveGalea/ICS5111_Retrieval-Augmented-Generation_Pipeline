{"summary": "there are more than 70 flaviviruses in the genus flavivirus. they are transmitted by arthropods such as mosquitoes. TBEV, TBEV, POWV, and LIV are encephalitic. TBEV, TBEV, POWV, and LIV are encephalitic. TBEV is found in central, eastern, and northern Europe and Asia. TBEV is considered one of the most important arboviruses in central and eastern european countries and in Russia. over the last decade there has been an approximately 300% increase in the number of TBE cases in Europe. TBEV is a zoonotic disease and the natural cycle of TBEV is dependent and maintained in a complex cycle involving ticks as the vector and reservoir of the virus. humans are not part of the natural transmission cycle of TBEV and are the incidental host when infected by a tick bite from an infected tick. transmission through consumption of unpasteurized milk has also been reported for TBEV. LGTV has not been associated with human disease under natural infections. it shares 84% sequence identity with TBEV. it is often used as a model virus for TBEV under biosafety level-2 conditions. the symptoms of POWV infection may include fever, headache, vomiting, weakness, confusion, seizures, and memory problems. there are no antiviral treatments or vaccines available against POWV. human infection occurs through contact with infected muskrats (Ondatra zibethicus) which are very sensitive to the infection and often succumb to the infection. secretion of OHFV in unpasteurized goat milk has been reported but no milk-borne outbreaks have been observed. 165 cases were reported between 1988 and 1997. TBEV is found in central, eastern, and northern Europe and Asia. TBEV is considered one of the most important arboviruses in central and eastern european countries and in Russia. over the last decade there has been an approximately 300% increase in the number of TBE cases in Europe [25] TBEV is a zoonotic disease and the natural cycle of TBEV is dependent and maintained in a complex cycle involving ticks as the vector and reservoir of the virus and small rodents as hosts for ticks. transmission through consumption of unpasteurized milk has also been reported for TBEV [34,35], as well as transmission via solid organ transplant [36]. TBEV is the only TBFV present in the united states. it is transmitted by Ixodes scapularis, Ixodes cookei, and several other Ixodes tick species, to small and medium size mammals, whereas humans are accidental dead-end hosts. Louping-Ill Virus LIV is mainly distributed in the UK and Ireland. it has also been detected in sheep in Norway and on the Bornholm island in Denmark. animals develop a febrile disease, which can progress to fatal encephalitis. secretion of OHFV in unpasteurized goat milk has been reported. no milk-borne outbreaks have been observed. 165 cases were reported between 1988 and 1997. TBFVs are enveloped viruses around 50 nm in diameter. the envelope carries two surface proteins, the envelope (E) protein and the membrane (M) protein. the nucleocapsid (NC) lies inside the viral envelope. the viral protein is encoded as a single polyprotein. viral RNA (vRNA) also functions as mRNA, associating with ribosomes to produce the polyprotein. the transmembrane domain of the viral protein is recognized as a signal peptide and recruits the vRNA/ribosomes/nascent polypeptide complex to the ER membrane, where it is co-translationally translocated into the ER membrane. the immature virion has heterodimers of E and prM that completely cover the lipid bilayer to form a spiky proteinaceous coat. the acidic environment of the Golgi induces conformational changes in the E and prM proteins. virions are then released by exocytosis, which completes the viral life cycle. RNA-seq and mass spectrometric analysis revealed that when challenged by TBEV infection, tick cells upregulated genes involved in immunity and metabolism. novel antiviral genes such as heat shock protein (HSP) 70 and 90 and trypsin were found to inhibit LGTV in tick cells. work on IFN in the fifties and sixties, TBEV served as a model system. TBEV was shown to induce IFN after infection and was also sensitive to pretreatment of IFNs. pretreatment of IFN was also found to inhibit KFDV, OHFV, and POWV titers in A549 cells. most important PRRs are toll-like receptor (TLR)3, TLR7, TLR8, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and melanoma differentiation-associated protein-5. TLR3 recognizes double stranded (ds) RNA, which is formed as an intermediate during flavivirus replication. innate antiviral response has been well-studied in mosquito-borne flavivirus infection. but responses to TBFVs are less investigated. IPS-1 pathway has been shown to protect mice from lethal LGTV infection. TIA-1/TIAR was found to bind viral RNA and inhibit viral translation. SGs could serve as a platform for IFN induction during TBEV infection. no animal experiments have shown any significance of the TLR3-TRIF pathway in tick-borne flavivirus infection. IFNAR2 interacts with tyrosine kinase-2 (Tyk2), whereas IFNAR2 interacts with JAK1. phosphorylate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)-1 and STAT-2 then form a heterodimer. these ISGs act to coordinate an antiviral response that is able to inhibit almost any step in the viral life cycle. in vitro studies on primary cortical astrocytes show a fast up regulation and secretion of IFN after TBEV infection. it was later shown that IFNAR expression protected the astrocytes from the virus-induced cytopathic effects. only a few ISGs have been identified to play a role in TBEV and LGTV infection. the TRIM proteins are a family of proteins able to mediate antiviral activity against many different viruses. the rodent specific TRIM79 was identified to interact with LGTV NS5 in a yeast two-hybrid screen. TRIM79 expression inhibited viral infection of LGTV and TBEV. viperin has no effect on the binding or entry of TBEV. but viperin targets genome replication, packaging, and release of TBEV. TBEV replication is strongly inhibited by viperin. TBEV replicates efficiently inside membrane vesicular structures in the ER. in the absence of viperin, TBEV replication is strongly reduced by viperin. viperin mediates this effect by interacting and sequestering GBF1. viperin strongly inhibits tick-borne flaviviruses in vivo and in vitro. this strong antiviral effect on TBEV is mediated by targeting the virus at multiple steps of the life cycle. TBEV, like other flaviviruses, uses a passive evasion mechanism in which the virus hides its dsRNA intermediates in vesicular structures inside the ER membranes. dsRNA is hidden away inside these vesicles as a passive way to prevent PPR recognition (red circle) and upregulation of IFNs. NS5 of TBEV was shown to inhibit the JAK-STAT pathway. NS5 interacts with scribble (hScrib) which mediates NS5 localization to the plasma membrane. this interaction enables NS5 to inhibit type I and type II IFN mediated JAK-STAT signaling. deNV and WNV sfRNA were found to suppress the RNAi response in both mammalian and insect cells. sfRNA has been shown to inhibit the antiviral RNAi response in tick cells. sfRNA has been shown to inhibit the antiviral RNAi response in tick cells. ines are produced by cells upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns. signaling through IFNAR induces an antiviral state by the expression of hundreds of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) the particular PRR involved in the recognition depends on the infecting virus. interferon-beta promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) (also known as mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA) and CARD adapter-inducing IFN-beta (Cardif). absence of IPS-1 resulted in lower systemic IFN response, which correlated with higher viral replication in the peripheral tissues. SG contains ribonucleoprotein aggregates with translationally stalled mRNAs, 40S ribosomes, and several RNA-binding proteins. TIA-1/TIAR was found to bind viral RNA and inhibit viral translation. little is known about the role of the TLR7/8-Myd88 pathway in tick-borne flavivirus infection. type I IFN signals in an autocrine and paracrine manner by binding to the heterodimeric IFNAR. these subunits are associated with Janus activated kinases (JAK) localized in the cytoplasm. IFNAR1 interacts with tyrosine kinase-2 (Tyk2), whereas IFNAR2 interacts with JAK1. in vitro studies on primary cortical astrocytes show a fast up regulation and secretion of IFN after TBEV infection. only a few ISGs have been identified to play a role in TBEV and LGTV infection [86,141,147,147,149,150] s in the OAS genes have been shown to correlate with severe forms of TBE in patients. the murine isoform Oas1b confers strain dependent resistance against neurovirulence from far eastern TBEV [155] TRIM proteins are a family of proteins able to mediate antiviral activity against many different viruses. viperin is able to inhibit several different viruses, but the mechanism of action, the important motif in viperin and the step of viral life cycle inhibited differed for different viruses. viperin targets genome replication, packaging, and release of TBEV. degradation of TBEV NS3 was shown to be proteasome dependent. viperin mediated this effect by interacting and sequestering GBF1. TBEV replicates efficiently inside membrane vesicular structures in ER. viperin has been shown to be antiviral active against many different viruses in vitro. but few studies have investigated viperin\u2019s role in vivo. viperin inhibited viral replication in the olfactory bulb and cerebrum. TBEV, like other flaviviruses, uses a passive evasion mechanism. the virus hides its dsRNA intermediates in vesicular structures inside the ER membranes. dsRNA leaks out and IFNs are upregulated via IRF3 and IPS-1/MAVS. the most conserved inhibition of the type I IFN system is the antagonism of IFNAR signaling carried out by NS5. this mechanism is conserved between several mosquito and tick-borne flaviviruses. NS5 of TBEV interacts with scribble (hScrib) which mediates NS5 localization to the plasma membrane. the ability to produce sfRNA in WNV was shown to be needed for efficient viral growth in vitro and for pathogenicity in mice. sfRNA was found to bind to TRIM25 to inhibit RIG-I-induced type I interferon expression in both mammalian and insect cells. sfRNA was found to suppress the RNAi response in both mammalian and insect cells. TLR3 recruits adapter-inducing interferon- (TRIF) [121], TLR7 and 8 recruit myeloid differentiation primary response 88 (Myd88) [122], whereas the RIG-I-like helicases, RIG-I and MDA-5, recruit interferon-beta promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) (also known as mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA) IFN induction was shown to be completely dependent on IPS-1 and IRF3 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. viral recognition through the IPS-1-pathway was shown to be dependent on RIG-I and not MDA-5 in human osteosarcoma cells. SG contains ribonucleoprotein aggregates with translationally stalled mRNAs, 40S ribosomes, and several RNA-binding proteins. studies have demonstrated the importance of the RIG-I-like-IPS-1 pathway in tick-borne flavivirus infection. the role of the TLR pathways remains unclear. IFNAR1 interacts with tyrosine kinase-2 (Tyk2). astrogliosis has been shown in post mortem human brains [142,143] astrocytes have been shown to be resistant to TBEV-induced cytopathic effects. only a few ISGs have been identified to play a role in TBEV and LGTV infection. the TRIM proteins are a family of proteins able to mediate antiviral activity against many different viruses. TRIM79 expression inhibited viral infection of LGTV and TBEV by mediating lysosomal dependent degradation of NS5. viperin is an iron sulphur protein with three domains; a N-terminus amphipathic alpha-helix which mediates the intracellular localization to the ER, a S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) radical domain. viperin targets genome replication, packaging, and release of TBEV. viperin interacts with several viral proteins; NS2A, NS2B, and NS3. degradation of TBEV NS3 was shown to be proteasome dependent. this effect was found to be dependent on viperin. perin interferes with particle assembly by inducing secretion of C particles in a COPII-dependent manner, independent of COPI. viperin has been shown to be antiviral active against many different viruses in vitro. RNA is dependent on the SAM domain or the C-terminal domain. viperin is responsible for interfering with virus assembly and release. TBEV uses a passive evasion mechanism in which the virus hides its dsRNA intermediates in vesicular structures inside the ER membranes. NS5 protein interacts with PEPD thus preventing IFNAR1 plasma membrane localization (red T) NS5 also prevents STAT1 phosphorylation (red T) a subgenomic noncoding RNA is formed during TBFV infection. it is produced as a product of incomplete degradation of genomic viral RNA by cellular 5\u2032-3\u2032 exoribonuclease XRN1. the ability to produce sfRNA in WNV was shown to be needed for efficient viral growth in vitro and for pathogenicity in mice. we know very little about how the innate immune response regulates the neuroinvasion of neurotropic TBFV, and the specific interactions between the tick vector and the different viruses."}
