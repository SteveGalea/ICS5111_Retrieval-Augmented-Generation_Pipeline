{"summary": "herpes stromal keratitis is a double stranded DNA virus associated with chronic infections in humans. HSV-1 is the leading infectious cause of corneal blindness worldwide. 34.5 suppresses autophagy levels in the host by binding to the autophagy protein beclin1 [11, 13, 14], but such a response was only reported at high multiplicities of infection [15, 16]. Interestingly, autophagy may be inhibited or may remain unchanged significantly in most cell types tested. analysis of autophagy in HSV-1 Infection of HeLa Cells. we assessed the autophagic flux of the cells as a function of infection over time. however, most effect was seen at 6 hpi. uninfected or infected HeLa cells were harvested at 6 hpi, lysed, and immunoblotted. E. Quantification of LC3-II levels in (A-D) normalized to the housekeeping protein GAPDH. analysis of Autophagy in HSV-1 Infection of Retinal Ganglion Cells. the cells were mock-treated, infected with LC3 plasmid or treated with a known autophagy-inducing chemical MG132. at 24 hpi, the cells were washed and briefly treated with 0.05% saponin. the cells were mock-treated, treated with MG132, or infected with HSV-1 for 24 hr. the cells were washed in presence of saponin, and analyzed cytofluorimetrically. uninfected or infected HCE cells were immunoblotted at 8 hpi. study takes a comprehensive approach to address how HSV-1 infection regulates autophagy. phagy was monitored via immunoblotting of microtubule-associated protein 1A/1B-light chain 3 (LC3)-II, an indicator of autophagic activity of the cells. most effect (which did not exceed 50% inhibition of the basal autophagy levels) was seen at 6 hpi (Fig 1A and 1E) the cells were transfected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-LC3 plasmid. they were then assessed microscopically at early (2 hpi) and later (24 hpi) points of infection. the cells did not show any significant change of autophagy levels upon infection. at 24 hpi, the cells were washed and then briefly treated with 0.05% saponin which solubilizes the non-autophagosomal LC3-I but does not affect the autophagosomal lipidated LC3-II protein. saponin-untreated cells were used to quantify total LC3 levels in the cell. MG132-treated cells showed remarkable induction of autophagy. analysis of autophagy in HSV-1 Infection of Corneal Epithelial Cells. the cells were infected with HSV-1 (KOS) at MOI of 0.1 or 1. autophagy was monitored after 2 or 8 hpi. autophagy regulation or 'fine-tuning' implies inhibition of the pathway. autophagy was shown to play proviral or antiviral roles in various viral infections. induced autophagy directly enhanced virus replication. hypotheses for the possible role of the fraction of autophagy remaining in infection may be speculated. differences in basal-level autophagy among cell types were reported. it is reasonable to speculate that the virus regulates autophagy via inhibition or stabilization of autophagy. ICP34.5 may play an autophagy-independent role that prevents viral clearance in late infection in vivo but does not affect early infection, such as control of adaptive immune responses. significant variations in the ICP34.5 gene and protein sequences among commonly used laboratory strains were reported [38\u201341]. cells were grown in DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with antibiotics and serum. human corneal epithelial cell line is an SV40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line previously established [47], and was provided by K. Hayashi. previously described [49] were obtained from Addgene (plasmid numbers 24987, and 24991, respectively) polyclonal antibodies against LC3 were from Novus Biologicals (Catalog number NB100-2220) polyclonal antibodies against LC3 were from Santa Cruz (Catalog number sc-25778) confocal microscopy was used for monitoring of LC3-GFP autophagosomal punctae. after treatment or infection, the cells were washed, fixed in paraformaldehyde. image analysis was performed using MetaMorph software (Zeiss) human corneal epithelial cell line is an SV40-immortalized human corneal epithelial cell line previously established.
