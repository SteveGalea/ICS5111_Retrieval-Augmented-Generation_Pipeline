PBMCs were labelled with a mouse anti-CD3 antibody (Abcam, Hong Kong) followed by incubation with rat anti-mouse IgG1 microbeads (MACS; Miltenyi Biotec, Germany)2. the cells were divided into two parts, one part was detected with flow cytometry to determining the homing receptor levels on CD8+ cells. the cells treated with RA were labelled with Cell Tracker CM-DiI mixed lymphocyte reaction CD3+ T cells were labelled with 0.1 M CFDA-SE. BM-DCs were pulsed with varying concentrations of RA or 100 ng/ml LPS for 48 h. followed repeated washes, T cells were incubated with pre-treated BM-DCs for 5 days. transwell migration assays were performed using 24-well Falcon cell culture inserts with 8 m pores. RA, RO 41-5253 or RA plus RO 41-5253 were added to the BM-DCs at different concentrations for 48 h before use. s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV increased the number of gut-homing CD8+ cells expressing 7-integrin and CCR9 compared with the control. s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV increased the number of gut-homing CD8+ cells expressing 7-integrin and CCR9 compared with the control. cells were isolated from the porcine ileum and inguinal lymph nodes (iLNs) flow cytometry data from the ileum showed that the gut tropism receptor frequency on CD8+ cells was remarkably enhanced compared with the controls. the RA plus TGEV s.c. administration substantially expanded the areas with CD3+ T cells compared with the controls. RA assists WI-TGEV in enhancing both local and systemic immune responses after subcutaneous immunization in piglets. immunization increased the TGEV-specific IgA levels compared with the s.c. TGEV alone treatment at days 7, 14 and 21. RA-assisted TGEV immunization could recruit IgA-secreting cells to the ileum and induce a robust antigen-specific IgA response. RA assists TGEV by increasing the DC numbers in the intestinal lamina propria of piglets in vivo. s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV and oral TGEV significantly enhanced the frequency of these migrated DCs compared with TGEV s.c. treatment. the percentages of PE-HLA-DP+ FITC-CD16+ (A,C) and PE/Cy5-CD11b+ PE-SWC3a+ (B,D) DCs in intestines from immunized piglets were analyzed with flow cytometry. RA does not directly increase expression of gut-homing receptors on BM-DCs. FITC-SWC3a + PE-CD1a + BM-DCs after 48 h. quantification of percentages of FITC-SWC3a + PE-HLA-DP + BM-DCs after 48 h. CD3+ T cells were treated with or without RA (1,000 nM) for 2 days. RA-treated T cells were labelled with CFSE (green) and RA-treated T cells were labelled with tracker CM-DiI (red) mixed cells from the two populations were mixed and adoptively transferred into piglets via intravenous injection. twenty-four hours later, the mixed cells that homed to the ileal villi were detected by flow cytometry. there was no significant difference between the levels of homing cells in the piglets with or without RA-treated T cells. 1,000 nM RA-treated BM-DCs induced CD3+ cells to express 7 integrin and CCR9 compared with the untreated BM-DC group. at BM-DC/T-cell ratios of 1:10, 1,000 nM RA-treated BM-DCs still induced CD3+ cells to highly express 7 integrin and CCR9. l of RPMI 1640 medium loaded onto the apical side of transwells. 0.9 ml of medium or medium plus CCL25 (10 g/ml) was added to the transwells. the numbers of cells that migrated to the basolateral side were measured. RA increases the frequency of gut-homing cells in piglets immunized with WI-TGEV. RA increases the frequency of gut-homing cells in piglets immunized with WI-TGEV. s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV increased the number of gut-homing CD8+ cells expressing 7-integrin and CCR9 compared with the control. s.c. administration of RA plus TGEV increased the number of gut-homing CD8+ cells expressing 7-integrin and CCR9. the ileum was selected as the mucosal immune effector site. we assessed the level of CD8+ cell homing to the ileum. the gut tropism receptor frequency on CD8+ cells was enhanced. a similar finding was observed in the faeces, in which the subcutaneous RA plus TGEV immunization obviously increased the TGEV-specific IgA levels compared with the s.c. TGEV alone treatment at days 7, 14 and 21 (ELISA method) RA assisted TGEV s.c. treatment by increasing the DC numbers in the intestinal lamina propria of piglets in vivo DCs are express MHCII (SLA-DP), CD172a (SWC3a), CD16, CD11R1, or CD11b2,26. s.c. RA helps TGEV in enhancing the percentages of HLA-DP+ CD16+ and CD11b+ SWC3a+ intestinal DCs in vivo. RA does not directly increase expression of gut-homing receptors on BM-DCs. BM-DCs were treated with or without RA (10\u20131,000 nM) after 48 or 96 h, the cells were collected and measured with flow cytometry. RA does not directly imprint gut-homing receptors on unactivated T cells. unactivated T cells were directly treated with or without RA in vitro. homing receptors 7 integrin and CCR9 were detected with flow cytometry. RA-treated T cells were isolated from a piglet and treated with or without RA. they were labelled with CM-DiI or CFSE (green) for long-term cellular labeling. twenty-four hours later, the mixed cells that homed to the ileal villi were detected by flow cytometry. 1,000 nM RA-treated BM-DCs induced CD3+ cells to highly express 7 integrin and CCR9 compared with the untreated BM-DC group. however, there was no significant difference compared with the untreated BM-DC group. expression levels of gut-homing-specific PE-7-integrin+ DyLight 649-CCR9+ on FITC-CD8+ T cells were analyzed with flow cytometry. the schematic depicts co-cultured cells that were resuspended in 0.35 ml of RPMI 1640 medium and loaded onto the apical side of transwells. RA receptor agonists (Ro-41-5253, 1,00 to 10,000 nM) were added with RA (1,000 nM) to the culture. the number of migrated cells among 1,000 or 10,000 nM Ro-41-5253 plus RA or RA treatments was no significant difference. a previous observation showed a strong chemotactic response in T cells when activated. antigens must overcome a series of mucosal barriers before they are captured by submucosal antigen-presenting cells. oral administration generally requires a large concentration of antigens to achieve effective immune protection levels36. an ideal TGEV vaccine should induce both local mucosal and systemic immune responses. a large amount of IgA-secreting cell homing to the gut is important to produce IgA antibody against intestinal pathogens41. this was consistent with previous report that RA was critical for the generation of gut-homing receptors on IgA-secreting cells41. the antigen dose in the oral immunization was 10 times higher than that in the subcutaneous immunization in our study. RA administration in the subcutaneous immunization improved TGEV mucosal humoral immune responses but also was less expensive. RA combined with the s.c. TGEV injection indeed induced a pronounced IgG response. RA treatment was unable to up-regulate the gut-homing-specific molecules as in mice8. a previous study showed that RA endowed BM-DCs with immature phenotypes. RA may regulate DCs in the porcine inguinal lymph nodes to imprint gut tropism receptors on lymphocytes. RA-pretreated BM-DCs showed a strong chemotactic response to porcine CCL25. RA could act as a \u201cmucosal adjuvant\u201d to induce mucosal DC. ous RA promotes intestinal lamina propria DCs to produce endogenous RA55, which guarantees gut-homing 47 and CCR9 expression by effector T cells11. RA inducing mucosal DCs to secrete TGF and IL-6, which enhance gut-homing receptors on lymphocytes. doi: 10.1038/srep24152 (2016)."}
