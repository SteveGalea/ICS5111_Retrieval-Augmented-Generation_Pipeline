{"summary": "SHFV is a member of the family Arteriviridae. other members include the prototype equine arteritis virus (EAV) and lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) the active sites of arterivirus PLP1 proteases were predicted to consist of a Cys-His tandem. however, the active sites of arterivirus PLPs were predicted to consist of a Cys-His tandem. the length of the sequence between the catalytic residues in arterivirus PLPs is half of that in coronavirus PLPs. the sequences of the cleavage sites used by arterivirus PLPs are not well conserved (8, 10, 11, 14, 16) an N-terminal zinc finger domain in EAV nsp1 and PRRSV nsp1 regulates sg mRNA and genome transcription abundance (2, 21\u201323) the putative SHFV PLP1, PLP1 and PLP1 boundaries were estimated using the putative cleavage sites and catalytic domains of the PLP1s of LDV and PRRSV. homology models were generated using the crystal structure of a PRRSV nsp1 protein (PDB code 3IFU) (10) and also the crystal structure of a PRRSV nsp1 protein (PDB code 3MTV) (11) as the template. an aliquot of SHFV, strain LVR 42-0/M6941, passage 2, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. aliquots of MA104 cell monolayers were infected with the stock virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.2. culture media were harvested at 32 h after infection and clarified by centrifugation. expression vector (Sigma) was subcloned into the pTNT expression vector (Promega) to construct plasmid DNA for use as the template in coupled in vitro transcription/translation reactions. the pTNT-FSM-wt construct was performed using a QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) pTNT-FSM cDNA constructs were used as the templates for in vitro coupled transcription/translation reactions performed using a TNT coupled wheat germ extract system. substituted nucleotides in the primer sequence are indicated by lowercase letters. 1 g of the plasmid DNA was mixed with 25 l of wheat germ extract, 2 l of TNT reaction buffer, 1 l of amino acid mixture without Cys, 1 l of TNT SP6 RNA polymerase, and 20 Ci of [35S]Cys (PerkinElmer) in a total volume of 50 l. in vitro translation reaction mixtures (50 l) were divided into four aliquots. the peptides in half of each sample were separated by SDS-PAGE on a 13% polyacrylamide gel. the remainder of the sample was frozen for use in a repeat analysis. the gels were fixed in 10% acetic acid and 30% methanol, incubated in Autofluor and then in anticracking buffer. the MS/MS spectra generated were searched against a custom database. infected MA104 monolayers were lysed by addition of radioimmunoprecipitation assay buffer. cell proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) or anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) after washes, the blots were processed for chemiluminescence using a super-Signal west Pico detection kit. sequence analysis was performed on the ORF1a protein sequence. cells were grown in minimal essential medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and 10 g/ml gentamicin at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere. an aliquot of SHFV, strain LVR 42-0/M6941, passage 2, was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. the cloned N-terminal region of ORF1a contained the entire nsp1 region as well as the first 273 nt of nsp2. the flag\u2013SHFV\u2013c-Myc region of the pFlag-SHFV-C-Myc clone was subcloned into the pTNT expression vector (Promega), generating pTNT-FSM-wt.

Cys63 aligned with the predicted catalytic Cys residues of both SHFV PLP1 and PLP1. it was located 67 aa from the PLP1 catalytic His130. however, Cys63 is followed by an Ala instead of by the Trp present in all other active arterivirus PLP1s. the homology model of SHFV nsp1 generated using the crystal structure of the type II PRRSV (strain XH-GD) nsp1 (10) and the homology model of SHFV nsp1 generated using the crystal structure of the type II PRRSV (strain XH-GD) nsp1 (10) are shown in Fig. 1C. the homology models suggested that the sequence and structure of SHFV nsp1 were the alignment and modeling data supported the hypothesis that the SHFV PLP catalytic residues are Cys63 and His130. most coronavirus PLPs recognize and cleave canonical -Lys-X-GlyGly- sites. however, the arterivirus PLP1 cleavage site sequences are not well conserved. expression plasmid containing the N-terminal region of ORF1a fused to an N-terminal Flag tag and a C-terminal c-Myc tag was constructed. wild-type cDNA was first used as the template in a coupled in vitro transcription/translation reaction done in the presence of [35S]Cys. the peptides produced by PLP1 autoprocessing were immunoprecipitated with anti-Flag, anti-c-My the 15-kDa band present only in the lysate lane was most likely nsp1. the nsp1 band was not as efficiently detected as the other peptides. the c-Myc-tagged nsp1+nsp2 band would be detected in both the lysate and c-Myc IP lanes. proteins labeled by incorporation of [35S]Cys were immunoprecipitated with murine IgG, anti-c-Myc, or anti-Flag antibody prior to separation by 13% SDS-PAGE. the positions of protein standards are indicated on the right, and the identities of the SHFV peptides generated are indicated on the left. the N- and C-terminal 30-kDa bands were thus designated nsp1+t and t+nsp1+nsp2. three additional, unexpected bands of 23, 27, and 28 kDa were present in both the lysate and the Flag IP lanes. construct with predicted nsp1 catalytic Cys246 substituted with an Ala produced full-length polyprotein (63 kDa) and nsp1++ polyprotein precursor (54-kDa) bands with increased intensity compared to the wild-type construct. however, detection of nsp1 (15 kDa) in the lysate lane and nsp1+nsp2 (23 kDa) in the lysate and nsp1 was not cleaved from nsp2 when the predicted nsp1 catalytic Cys378 was substituted. cleavage occurred efficiently at both the nsp1-nsp1 and nsp1-nsp1 junctions. cleavage occurred efficiently at both the nsp1-nsp1 and nsp1-nsp1 junctions. double mutants produced polypeptides with only one active PLP. the nsp1-nsp2 junction was cleaved when only PLP was active. the nsp1-nsp2 junction was also cleaved when only PLP was active. nsp1+t (30 kDa) and nsp1 (18-kDa) bands in the lysate and Flag IP lanes indicated that cleavage did not occur at the nsp1-nsp1 junction. lack of detection of nsp1+nsp2 (23 kDa) indicated that cleavage did not occur at the nsp1-nsp2 junction. the detection of nsp1+tt/t (30, 28 and 27 kDa) and tt/t+nsp1+nsp2 (39 and 30 kDa) unexpectedly indicated that PLP1 can also cleave within its own catalytic region as well as within the N-terminal region of nsp1. peptides produced by a construct with the 1 and 2 positions of this site mutated were analyzed. the nsp1 (18-kDa) band was not detected in the lysate or Flag IP lanes. the nsp1 (18-kDa) band was still detected in the lysate and Flag IP lanes. the intensity of these bands was lower than in wild-type reactions. the alignment of the SHFV PLP1s predicted -Arg-Arg-GlyGly-Gly- (aa 482 to 486) to be the PLP cleavage site. to determine whether cleavage occurs between G484 and G485, the 2 and 1 aa residues of this site were substituted. the bands produced by this construct were the same as those produced by the G484/G485 mutant construct. mutant polyproteins produced 30-kDa nsp1+t and t+nsp1+nsp2 bands by cleavage. each of the SHFV PLP1s was predicted to cleave between two Gly residues at each of the nsp1 junctions. analysis of the sequence did not reveal any -Gly-Gly- tandems. MS sequencing of selected in vitro autoprocessing cleavage products. the positions of the SHFV peptide bands were estimated by comparison to the positions of the protein standards. nsp1 (18-kDa) and nsp1+ (39-kDa) precursor regions were separately excised from the Flag IP lane of a wild-type construct autoprocessing reaction. products from in vitro transcription/translation reactions were separated on a 12% nuPAGE bis-tris gel and stained with colloidal blue. the nsp1 (18-kDa) band and the nsp1+ precursor band were separately excised from the Flag IP lane of a wild-type construct reaction. trypsin primarily cleaves on the C-terminal side of Lys or Arg residues except when a Pro follows one of these amino acids. two Lys residues were located on the N-terminal side of the predicted nsp1 cleavage site (5 and 9 positions), which resulted in peptide coverage ceasing just before the predicted cleavage site. a single band at 22 kDa was detected with an anti-N-terminal nsp1 antibody. anti-nsp1 antibody detected a single 18-kDa band. the estimated sizes for both nsp1 (22 versus 18 kDa) and nsp1 (18 versus 15 kDa) were higher in cell lysates than in vitro translation assays. an initial inspection of the sequences of the three SHFV PLP1 catalytic domains revealed a single Cys-Trp upstream of a His for each PLP1. a previous study predicted that the SHFV PLP1 catalytic Cys would be Cys79 based on an alignment of the nsp1 sequences of PRRSV, EAV, LDV, and SHFV (10. the catalytic function of SHFV Cys79 was not functionally tested in the previous study. this alignment predicted Cys63 as the SHFV PLP1 catalytic Cys. the GV[Q/T]G motif was also conserved in the PLP1 regions of PRRSV and LDV (11) a blue diamond indicates the only Cys adjacent to a Trp in SHFV PLP1. a blue triangle indicates the only Cys adjacent to a Trp in SHFV PLP1. the homology modeling did not clearly suggest which of the PRRSV nsp1 structures was the most similar to that of PRRSV nsp1. the homology model made on the basis of the PRRSV nsp1 structure appeared to be less structured in the lower half than the model made on the basis of the PRRSV nsp1 structure. alignment of the three SHFV PLP1s predicted cleavage would occur at a downstream -Gln-Leu-GlyThr-Cys- site. however, the alignment of the three SHFV PLP1s predicted that cleavage would occur at a downstream -Gln-Leu-GlyThr-Cys- site. s produced by PLP1 autoprocessing were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-Flag, anti-c-Myc, or a control IgG antibody. the wild-type construct produced 9 bands (63, 54, 39, 30, 28, 27, 23, 18, and 15 kDa) the full-length peptide (63 kDa), the intermediate precursors nsp1 plus nsp1 plus nsp1 and nsp1 + (39 the detection of both nsp1 and nsp1 indicated efficient cleavage occurred at both the nsp1-nsp1 and nsp1-nsp1 junctions. the c-Myc-tagged nsp1+nsp2 band would be detected in both the lysate and c-Myc IP lanes. the sizes and identities of the predicted cleavage products are indicated above the lines. the number of Cys residues in each peptide is indicated below the lines. an 30-kDa band was present in the lysate, Flag, and c-Myc IP lanes but not in the IgG IP lane. the predicted nsp1 catalytic Cys residue was substituted with Ala. the resulting construct was transcribed and translated in vitro. the resulting construct was transcribed and translated in vitro. detection of nsp1 (15 kDa) in the lysate lane and nsp1+nsp2 (23 kDa) in the lysate and c-Myc lanes indicated that cleavage at the nsp1-nsp1 junction still occurred when PLP was inactive. however, the absence of nsp1 (15 kDa) in the lysate lane and also the absence of n wild-type and mutant cDNAs were in vitro transcribed and translated. cleavage products were immunoprecipitated and analyzed as described in Fig. 2A. nsp1+t and nsp1+tt (30-, 28-, and 27-kDa) bands were also detected in the Flag IP lanes. the absence of an nsp1 (18-kDa) band in both the lysate and Flag IP lanes indicated that the nsp1-nsp1 junction was not cleaved by PLP. 1+nsp2 (23 kDa) in the lysate and c-Myc lanes and of nsp1+ (39 kDa) in the lysate and c-Myc lanes indicated that cleavage did not occur at the nsp1-nsp1 junction. the lack of detection of nsp1 (15 kDa) in the lysate and c-Myc lanes indicated that no sequence alignment nor homology modeling supported the existence of an additional protease between aa 100 and 203. previous studies showed that substitutions of the 1 and 2 amino acids of PLP cleavage sites prevented their recognition and cleavage. the intensities of the full-length (63-kDa) and nsp1++ (54-kDa) precursor protein bands were increased relative to the intensities of these bands in wild-type reactions. both the alignment of the three SHFV PLP1s and a previous arterivirus PLP1 alignment predicted -Tyr-Phe-GlyGly- (aa 348 to 351) to be the nsp1 cleavage site. the bands produced by this construct were the same as those produced by the G484/G485 mutant construct. the bands produced by this construct were the same as those produced by the G484/G485 mutant construct. a construct with the 2 and 1 aa residues of this site substituted with Val produced no 30-kDa band in the lysate, Flag IP, or c-Myc IP lanes. the increased intensity of the full-length polyprotein (63-kDa) and nsp1++ (54-kDa) bands indicated that mutation of this site decreased the overall cleavage efficiency of the polyprotein. the estimated nsp1 (18-kDa) and nsp1+ (39-kDa) precursor regions were separately excised from the Flag IP lane of a wild-type construct autoprocessing reaction. the nsp1++ (54-kDa) region was excised from the Flag IP lane of a Cys246Ala mutant construct autoprocessing reaction. in-gel trypsin digestion and the peptides analyzed by LC-MS/MS on an LTQ-Orbitrap XL mass spectrometer. the MS/MS spectra generated were searched against a custom database containing the SHFV nsp1+N-terminal nsp2 construct sequence, the Triticum proteome, and common contaminants using SEQUEST. three Arg residues are located immediately upstream of the predicted nsp1 cleavage site. the detection of 14 peptides ending at Arg478 and no peptides aligning to downstream sequences strongly suggested that cleavage occurred at the predicted nsp1 cleavage site. no truncated forms of nsp1 or longer forms of nsp1 were detected in cell lysates during the course of the infection. cleavage at sites within nsp1 may not occur in infected cells or that alternative proteins are in low abundance or rapidly degraded. catalytic Cys of SHFV PLP1 (Cys246) and that of SHFV PLP1 (Cys378) are both adjacent to a Trp residue. the only Cys within the SHFV nsp1 region with an adjacent Trp was located only 14 aa from the predicted catalytic His. arterivirus PLP1 cleavage sites show some conservation (-Trp/Tyr/Asn-Tyr/Phe-GlyGly-) each of the three SHFV PLP1s cleaves preferentially between two Gly residues. inefficient PLP1 cleavage was also observed at an alternative downstream -Gln-Leu-GlyThr- (aa 169 to 172) site in vitro. the 575-aa SHFV N-terminal polyprotein (599 aa with the tags) expressed in the in vitro transcription/translation assays is the longest arterivirus nsp1 polyprotein to have been tested to date. cleavage may occur when the polyprotein is misfolded. each of the SHFV nsp1 proteins is predicted to contain multiple posttranslational modification motifs, including myristoylation, phosphorylation, and glycosylation sites. these posttranslational modifications may facilitate the folding of the SHFV polyprotein into the optimal conformation for autoprocessing in vivo."}
