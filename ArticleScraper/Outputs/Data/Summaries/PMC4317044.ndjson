PLP2 deubiquitinates and stabilizes MDM2 to promote p53 Degradation. previous studies have revealed that the structure of PLP2 is similar to PLpro (20) and HAUSP (21) also, PLP2 harbors similar DUB activity to HAUSP (22), which prefers to bind and deubiquitinate the oncoprotein MDM2 (23, 24) lysates and immunoprecipitates were analyzed. D, MDM2 ubiquitination (Ub) is inhibited by coexpression of PLP2 in vivo. p53+/+ HCT116 cells were transfected with the indicated constructs. the steady-state level of MDM2 was increased and the half-life of MDM2 was prolonged when PLP2 was overexpressed. previous studies found that the catalytic residues Cys-1678 and His-1836 of PLP2 are important for its DUB activity. however, residue Asp-1849 is dispensable for DUB activity (9). analysis of the p53 half-life showed that the rate of p53 turnover was markedly increased when PLP2 was overexpressed. 6KR was less sensitive than p53-WT to the degradation mediated by PLP2. this result supports that PLP2 regulates p53 through ubiquitination-dependent protein degradation. the ability of PLP2 to down-regulate p53 levels was attenuated in the C1678A and H1836A mutants of PLP2 but not in the D1849A mutants. the expression of p53 was enhanced in response to poly(IC) and nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) of SARS-CoV significantly promotes p53 degradation by stabilizing MDM2. p53 activity in HCT116 cells was measured using a pG13L luciferase reporter gene assay. expression of PLP2 was determined by Western blot analysis. lysate was subjected to Western blot with indicated antibody. whole cell lysate was subjected to blot with indicated antibody. p53 plays a role in antiviral innate immunity by inducing apoptosis. the transcription activity of IFN- in HCT116 cells was measured by using an IFN- luciferase reporter gene assay. representative results of three independent reporter assay experiments are shown. p53+/+ and p53/hCT116 cells were transfected with or without V5-PLP2 or treated with LPS. the data are shown as the means S.D. (n = 3). p53 inhibits the transcription of the IFN- gene promoted by LPS. whereas PLP2 inhibited poly(IC)-triggered IRF9 transcription. the poly(IC)-triggered p53-independent IFN response is also regulated by PLP2. nsp3 (SARS-CoV) and PEDV also significantly inhibited IRF7 gene transcription. poly(I:C)-induced apoptosis seemed to be dependent on p53. poly(IC) had no apparent effects on p53/HCT116 cells. results suggest that PLP2 inhibits p53-dependent apoptosis. the IRF7 gene was knocked down by siRNA in p53+/+HCT116 cells. the transcription of the IRF7 and IFN- genes was not entirely inhibited. this suggests that the transcription of the IRF7 gene is regulated by factors other than IRF9. binding occurred in nuclear extracts of H1299 cells transfected with p53. p53 protein

with control vectors showed higher levels of cell fusion and cytopathogenicity rates. the papain-like protease of PLpro exhibits the identical effect to p53-mediated immune response with PLP2. cells were infected at an multiplicity of infection of 100 pfu/cell and harvested at indicated hours. p53 degradation and subsequent inhibition of interferon signaling has been investigated. p53-mediated immune responses are inactivated by various viral proteins. human papillomavirus, EBNA-5 of EBV, and vaccinia virus all induce degradation of p53. the X protein of hepatitis B virus has been shown to interact with p53. however, whether coronavirus subverts the p53-mediated host immune response is not entirely clear. ic acids in the cells encode viral proteins, including PLP2. the deubiquitinated MDM2 is accumulated in the nucleus, where it interacts with p53 and recruits p53 to the cytoplasm for proteasomal degradation. thus, PLP2 strongly inhibits p53-mediated IFN- production and apoptosis while promoting viral growth in cells. p53 induces the expression of IRF7, which may later activate type I interferon genes. in vitro EMSA assays showed the direct binding of p53 to the IRF7-p53BS

by host cells as components of antiviral defense. p53 and certain cytokines involved in antiviral responses are inactivated. coronavirus infection induces very low levels of type I IFNs. p53 activates the PUMA gene to induce apoptosis. p53 activates the PUMA gene to induce apoptosis. p53 activates the PUMA gene to induce apoptosis. previous studies indicate that p53 also functions as a transcription factor of the IFN- gene. p53 activation by dsRNA is sufficient to induce the transcription of IFN- (33) the inhibitory regulation of PLP2 on IFN- may not only depend on p53 signaling manner, but on other cell signaling, such as IRF3 signaling. p53 transactivates IRF7-p53BS luciferase activity in cultured cells. in vitro EMSA assays showed the direct binding of p53 to the IRF7-p53BS sequence. p53 functions as a bona fide transcriptional factor of the IRF7 gene. coronavirus encodes antagonistic proteins of p53 to inactivate the innate immune response. p53 and certain cytokines involved in antiviral responses are inactivated by various viral proteins by either silencing cellular immunity or protecting cells from apoptosis. our findings uncover PLP2 as an important negative regulator of p53-mediated apoptosis and the type I IFN response. at the early stage of infection, p53 acts as an important transcription factor to transactivate the IRF9 and IRF7 genes. p53 activates the PUMA gene to induce apoptosis. p53 transactivates the IRF9 and IRF7 genes at the early stage of infection. at the advanced stage of infection, viral nucleic acids in the cells encode

infection, IRF7 induces the expression of early interferon genes. late in infection, IRF7 induces the high expression of IFN and IFN. large T antigen of SV40, as well as BZLF1 and EBNA3C of the EBV interact with p53 and inhibit its activity. the E1A of adenovirus and E7 of human papillomavirus inhibit its transcriptional activity. the X protein of hepatitis B virus has been shown to interact with p53. p53 acts as an important transcription factor to transactivate the IRF9 and IRF7 genes. p53 activates the PUMA gene to induce apoptosis. at the early stage of infection, viral nucleic acids in the cells encode viral proteins, including PLP2, which directly interact with and deubiquitinates MDM2. p53 induces the expression of IRF7-p53BS luciferase activity in cultured cells. in vitro EMSA assays showed the binding of p53 to the IRF7-p53BS sequence. in vivo mRNA detection illustrated that the IRF7 gene is transactivated by p53. late in infection, IRF7 induces the high expression of IFN and IFN. early and late IFN genes cannot be transcribed, which suggests that IRF7 participates in all stages of type I interferon production."}
