{"summary": "mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are present in a variety of tissues during human development. they retain an extensive capacity for multi-lineage differentiation into chondrocytes, adipocytes, osteoblasts, and tenocytes. the presence of specific, distinct antigens identified by the monoclonal antibodies SH2, SH3, and SH4, suggests that these epitopes are developmentally regulated. oligomers use on oligomers to detect each gene for most genes. chemiluminescence to measure gene expression levels. fluorescence to grid to normalize and identify microarray features. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. non-adherent cells were then removed. the medium was changed twice a week. 200,000 MSCs were placed in a 15-mL polypropylene tube and centrifuged at 1,000 rpm for 5 min. pellets were then cultured at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2 and 300 L of serum-free chondrogenic medium. 1,200 L of RLT buffer supplemented with beta-mercaptoethanol was added to the washed cells. RNA integrity was assessed by gel electrophoresis and RT-PCR. each RNA pool (2 g) was labeled with Digoxigenin-UTP. analysis and data normalization were performed using the method described by Quackenbush (8). cDNAs obtained were used as a template for PCR amplification using gene-specific primers. PCR amplification of cDNA was performed in an automated thermal cycler. BM was placed in a 50 mL syringe containing 5,000 units of preservative-free heparin, diluted 1:1 with phosphate buffered saline, resuspended in PBS to a final volume of 10 mL. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. non-adherent cells were then removed. the medium was changed twice a week. secondary antibodies were removed by washing three times with PBS. Labeled cells were observed under an Axiovert 200 (Zeiss, Thornwood, NY, USA) RNA preparation Total RNA was extracted from undifferentiated MSCs. 1,200 L of RLT buffer supplemented with beta-mercaptoethanol (10 L/mL) was added to the washed cells. each RNA pool (2 g) was labeled with Digoxigenin-UTP. Applied Biosystems 1,700 (AB1,700) Chemiluminescent Microarrays Analyzer scanned signals of the cRNA and standard control spots. cDNA was synthesized using reverse transcriptase (RT) and 1 g of total RNA. cDNAs obtained were used as a template for PCR amplification using gene-specific primers for target genes and for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) cDNAs were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. cultures were started at 5,000 cells per well, harvested daily for 10 days. numbers of adherent cells were counted. a morphologically homogeneous population of 90% confluent fibroblast-like cells was obtained. RT-PCR analyses of undifferentiated and differentiated human mesenchymal stem cells. expression levels of 10 genes with high fold changes were confirmed by microarray analysis. expression levels of the 10 genes selected were low in undifferentiated cells. expression levels of IL-15 tended to be decreased in microarray, but the expression pattern of IL-15 was different. x-axis represents fold changes determined by microarray and RT-PCR analysis. cultured BM-MSCs were positive for SH2 by flow cytometry. cultured BM-MSCs were positive for SH2 by immunofluorescence staining. the cells appeared flattened in serum-free medium in presence of TGF-3 and dexamethasone. between days 2 and 3, pellet became spherical without any increase in size. between days 2 and 3, pellet became spherical without any increase in size. RT-PCR analysis of 10 selected genes in undifferentiated (con) and differentiating stem cells. Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as an internal control. expression levels of 9 genes were low in undifferentiated cells. expression patterns of IL-15 were different in microarray. microarray technology used did not allow quantitative comparisons between the expressional levels of different genes. results show sequences for gene expressional changes during BM-MSC chondrogenesis. peroxiredoxin-1 is a strong chemotactic component in cartilage cells produced by mesenchymal stem cells. it can promote cartilage cells to secrete specific extracellular matrix (proteoglycans and collagen type II) and it offers a greater efficiency in repairing cartilage and subchondral bone defects. previous studies have reported that MSCs express IL-15, essential hematopoietic growth factor (26, 27) and IL-15 is also a potent apoptosis inhibitor. the serotonin receptor 7 is the most recently identified member of the serotonin receptor family and is found in the hypothalamus, thalamus, hippocampus, and cortex (29)."}
