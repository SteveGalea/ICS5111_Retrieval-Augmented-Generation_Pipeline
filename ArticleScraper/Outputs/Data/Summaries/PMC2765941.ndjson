{"summary": "the 1918-19 pandemic caused between 40 and 100 million deaths at a time when communications and means of transportation were not as fast and efficient as they are now. the pandemic caused between 40 and 100 million deaths at a time when the communications and means of transportation on earth were not as fast and efficient as they are now. the pandemic could originate from a new human virus resulting from the adaptation of an avian virus. more than 450 cases were documented among humans with a fatality rate of more than 60%. the situation faced by Mexico and the decisions made are a topic of analysis and allow us to better prepare ourselves for a new public health threat. a 39-year-old woman died of severe atypical pneumonia in 2009 in the capital city of Oaxaca. the influenza continued to behave atypically and 5 days after the epidemiologic alert, the necessary steps were taken to prevent the population from attending crowded places. a prepandemic alert was declared and the preventive and control measures were intensified. the president of the republic issued a decree empowering the federal minister of health to coordinate the public, private and social settings to comply with the national ordinance. the next step was summoning an Extraordinary meeting of the General Health Council, as well as the national health council, to establish and coordinate all the prevention and health promotion actions. the suspension of all sorts of events held indoors or outdoors, whether at religious centers, stadiums, theaters, cinemas, bars, discotheques. the ministry of health convened an extraordinary and permanent meeting of the general health council and the national health council. the former reports to the president of the republic and has regulatory and advisory roles. the latter is a collegiate body responsible for formulating the health policies implemented in the country. the civil population acted responsibly in view of the possibility of a major catastrophe. the population of one of the largest cities in the world adopted the suggested steps. a biological sample was collected from all suspected cases of influenza. the influenza virus was confirmed in 30% of the samples. the sample collection flow charts were modified trying to be more selective. a \"quick test\" was purchased and distributed massively during the crisis. a broad network of laboratories certified by the world health organization (WHO) made it possible to set up the appropriate equipment and technique for viral identification in only three days time. a nominal registry was kept containing the patient records and death certificates of all the cases reported as compatible with influenza. this information was provided to WHO for its most appropriate and convenient use. a fund was created to provide economic incentives to the academic and researcher groups to participate in grants to further the knowledge on the virus, its virulence, transmissibility, affected groups, severity, etc. a toll free telephone number was made available 24 hours a day. the civil population adopted the suggested steps even though they touched the most sensitive fibers of the social fabric. healthcare Initially the aim was to assure the protection of the personnel participating in the teams that provided medical care. a \"quick test\" was purchased and distributed massively during the crisis. two epidemiologic surveillance systems were set up to get descriptive information of cases. the first system was recording the suspected cases of influenza by collecting the above mentioned data. the second system was established to ship biological samples to the reference lab. a nominal registry was kept containing the patient records and death certificates of all the cases reported as compatible with influenza. it was possible to analyze the epidemic behavior on a daily basis and thus make the appropriate decisions with the proper rationale. the government prepared itself to normalize the activities that had been disrupted by it. the prevention and control guidelines for resuming the activities were disseminated. the establishment of checkpoints at schools is a measure that led to maintaining a low case number. there are various useful approaches to model the potential impact of a pandemic. it is estimated that in an extreme scenario, such as the one in 1918-19, 50,000 additional deaths and more than 240,000 additional hospital admissions could have occurred. a moderate scenario, such as the 1968 pandemic, foresaw that without mitigation and control measures, hospital admissions would have exceeded 30,000, deaths would have amounted to 8,600 and almost 4.6 million outpatient consultations would have occurred. of the 187 patients who have so far died of influenza A(H1N1), 35% had metabolic conditions like obesity and diabetes mellitus, 23% of smoking and 16% of cardiovascular disease, followed by angina and arterial hypertension. the reported fatality rate is 0.87%, the incubation period is 3-4 days, the transmission rate reported by Ro is 1.4 and the confirmation rate of suspicious cases is 29% [7] despite the great coordination achieved, there were information gaps concerning the course of the epidemic. despite the great coordination achieved, there were information gaps concerning the course of the epidemic and particularly the data updating process. the new virus has led to mitigating the economic, sanitary and social effects. the emergence of the new virus will be recorded in the annals of world history."}
