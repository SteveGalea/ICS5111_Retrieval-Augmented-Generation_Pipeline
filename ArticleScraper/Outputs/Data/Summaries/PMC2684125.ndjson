{"summary": "we compared the S-gene in SARS-CoV sequences isolated from patients included in a recently published phylogenetic tree. this gene synthesizes the Spike-protein that is involved in virus-to-host-cell-epitope interactions. stepwise genetic distance was greatest immediately following initial infection and diminished to a plateau then after. the points represent nucleotide substitution rates r among 51 SARS-CoV sequences obtained between November 2002 and March 2003. the upper and lower points at t = 0 represent r (civet sequence SZ16, human sequence GZ02) and r (human sequence GD01), respectively. phylogenetic tree (He et al. 2004) 51 SARS-CoV sequences (1000 replicates) performed linear regression involving divergence times and genetic distances from a hypothetical ancestor. extrapolated backward to 0 divergence to obtain estimated origin times t. the origin time for SARS-CoV in humans was estimated to have transpired approximately 45 days prior to the actual index case date. previously published estimates \u2018redate\u2019 inaccurately, to months prior to or weeks following the real-world index case date (Lu et al. 2003); and December 12, 2002 (Zeng et al. 2003). exhibited by the SARS-CoV immediately after initially infecting humans (t = 0\u201325, Fig. 1) might represent a time period during which the virus \u2018settled\u2019 before becoming \u2018comfortable\u2019 in its new environment. if settling constitutes a general phenomenon, we recommend subjecting virus sequences to computational, non-molecular clock assumption analyses."}
