{"summary": "changes in mRNA stability account for as much as 40% to 60% of changes in steady-state mRNA levels in basic cellular processes. a core set of conserved enzymes is responsible for both basal and regulated mRNA degradation in eukaryotes. a core set of conserved enzymes is responsible for both basal and regulated mRNA degradation in eukaryotes, including two potent exoribonucleases. virus-encoded factors can cause widespread degradation of cellular mRNAs and block host gene expression. it is unclear what role host pathways play in this context [15], [16], [17], [18]. several herpesviral SOX homologs exhibit robust 5\u2032-3\u2032 DNase activity and weaker exonuclease activity towards RNA substrates. it is unclear to what extent the in vitro RNase activity contributes to the host shutoff activity in cells, and what cellular cofactors may participate in the specific targeting and efficient destruction. Xrn1 participates in SOX-mediated degradation of cellular RNAs. mutational analyses indicated that this activity cannot fully account for SOX-induced mRNA degradation in cells. Xrn1 plays a major role in basal mRNA turnover in the cytoplasm. Xrn1 is required for the removal of a 3\u2032 intermediate during SOX-mediated mRNA degradation. 293T cells were treated with control or Xrn1 siRNAs, then transfected with the indicated reporters +/ SOX. level of Xrn1 protein depletion is shown on the right, with actin as a loading control. a flaviviral Xrn1-blocking element (SLII) was inserted at different positions within the mRNA. the full-length mRNA is 1.2 kb, and the expected size of the fragment protected from Xrn1 degradation by SLII within the 5\u2032 UTR is 1.1 kb, within the coding region is 900 bp, and within the 3\u2032 UTR is 500 bp. mRNA degradation bypasses the requirement for deadenylation and decapping. a single copy of the Xrn1-blocking SLII element led to a stronger Xrn1 block that can be visualized during basal GFP mRNA turnover even in cells lacking SOX. a fraction of the RNA was treated with oligo(dT) and RNAse H to remove the poly(A) tail prior to blotting with a GFP 3\u2032 UTR or an 18S probe. a fraction of the RNA was treated with oligo(dT) and RNAse H to remove the poly(A) tail prior to blotting with a GFP 3\u2032 UTR or an 18S probe. we were able to purify the GFP intermediate after poly(A) selection of the mRNA over oligo(dT) coupled beads. together, these data indicate that SOX can bypass the main regulatory step of normal mRNA degradation and render RNAs directly accessible to Xrn1. we predicted that mRNA degradation in SOX-expressing cells would occur in a decapping-independent manner. mRNAs can be made accessible to Xrn1 without prior deadenylation or decapping. a defined-length intermediate also suggests that cleavage is directed to a specific location or sequence within the mRNA. a specific element in the GFP coding region directs an endonucleolytic cleavage in SOX-expressing cells. the modified GFP mRNA (GFPrep) contains an internal repeat of the first 201 basepairs of the GFP coding region (grey shaded area) 293T cells were treated with control or Xrn1 siRNAs, then transfected with GFP or GFPrep +/ SOX. RNA was Northern blotted with a GFP 3\u2032 UTR or an 18S probe. the inserted nucleotides are numbered based on their position relative to the GFP start codon. GFPrep (nt 1\u2013201) is included as a positive control. RNA was blotted with a GFP 3\u2032 UTR or 18S probe. Arrowheads denote degradation intermediates. catalytic residues of SOX are required for host shutoff In vitro. several herpesviral homologs of SOX exhibit weak DNA endonuclease activity and RNase activity on linear RNA substrates. mutation of one catalytic residue in BGLF5 (D203S) abolished the ability of SOX to deplete GFP mRNA in cells. all the catalytic and putative DNA binding residues tested were required for in vitro DNase activity. thus, our mutational analysis suggests that the catalytic activity of SOX is required for host shutoff. mRNA turnover activity of SOX was responsible for the generation of the degradation intermediate. SOX mutant lacking only DNase activity associated with viral genome processing (Q129H) [33], only the mRNA turnover activity (P176S) [33], or a catalytic mutant lacking both activities (D221S). the degradation intermediate was not produced in either of the two mutants lacking RNA turnover activity, but readily detectable in cells expressing Q129H. the level of polysome depletion during viral infection is likely underestimated, as 20% of induced cells generally fail to enter the lytic cycle. the depletion of polyribosomes was not due to chemical treatment alone, because treatment of the KSHV negative BJAB B cell line did not result in a similar decrease in polysomes. TREx BCBL-1-RTA cells were mock treated (latent) or induced (lytic) with 1 g/ml doxycycline, 500 ng/ml ionomycin, and 20 ng/ml 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 24 h to stimulate KSHV replication. we also tested the sedimentation profile of the SOX D221S catalytic mutant, and found it to mimic that of wild-type expression of wild-type SOX alone caused significant depletion of polysomes relative to vector-transfected cells. neither of the host shutoff defective SOX mutants had this effect. the failure of SOX to degrade this mRNA could be due to its translational incompetence. the inability of SOX to degrade the non-Pol II transcripts could be due to the absence of an ORF or the presence of RNP complexes occluding SOX cleavage sites. in both cases, the GFP RNA was not targeted by SOX. 293T cells were transfected with control or Xrn1 shRNAs. RNA was Northern blotted with 3\u2032 end dsRed2 or 18S probes. the arrowhead indicates the position of the SOX-induced cleavage product. a modified version of the encephalomyocarditis virus internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) can promote cap-independent translation but is highly structured. insertion of EMCV into the GFP 5\u2032 UTR 30 nt from the cap significantly reduced GFP protein accumulation. however, in Xrn1-depleted cells, SOX still induced cleavage of this mRNA. degradation intermediate is absent in all fractions from cells expressing the SOX catalytic mutant D221S (Figure 7B) the degradation intermediate sediments predominantly with the 40S fractions. 293T cells were transfected with Xrn1 shRNA, followed by expression of GFP and either wild-type (WT) SOX (A) or the catalytically dead SOX D221S (B) Xrn1 is required for the removal of a 3\u2032 intermediate during SOX-mediated mRNA degradation. depletion of Xrn1 did not protect full-length mRNA. but it resulted instead in accumulation of a shorter mRNA intermediate. Xrn1 knockdown was assessed by Western blot, using tubulin as a loading control. RNA from 293T cells transfected with the indicated reporter +/ SOX was blotted using probes against either the 5\u2032 (probe A; left panel) or 3\u2032 (probe B; right panel). Xrn1 is involved in SOX-induced RNA degradation in an siRNA-independent manner by using a flaviviral structural element (SLII) that can block 5\u2032-3\u2032 RNA degradation by Xrn1 [14] in expressing cells, insertion of the SLII in the 3\u2032 UTR of the DsRed2 reporter resulted in the appearance of a protected fragment of a size consistent with the portion of the mRNA downstream of the SLII insertion of two copies of the Xrn1-blocking element led to a stronger Xrn1 block that can be visualized during basal GFP mRNA turnover even in cells lacking SOX. in the absence of SOX, removal of the poly(A) tails by incubation with oligo(dT) and RNase H had little effect on the mobility of the fragment. Xrn1 protein levels were assessed by Western blot (right panels in B and C) 293T cells were treated with control siRNAs or siRNAs against the decapping complex protein Dcp1A. they were then transfected with GFP +/ SOX and/or the Dcp2 dominant negative mutant E148Q (Dcp2 DN) at least one additional decapping enzyme exists in mammalian cells. overexpression of the mutant was sufficient to reduce basal mRNA turnover of the GFP-2xSLII reporter. we also depleted levels of the hRrp41 subunit of the 3\u2032-5\u2032 exosome. a specific element in the GFP coding region is sufficient for production of degradation intermediates by SOX. a specific element in the GFP coding region is sufficient for production of degradation intermediates by SOX. a specific element in the GFP coding region is sufficient for production of degradation intermediates by SOX. an internal GFP primer and a primer to the adapter ligated to the 5\u2032 end of the RNAs were used to amplify GFP in each sample. full length refers to the band corresponding to the intact GFP transcript, intermediate refers to the 300 bp band preferentially amplified in the lysate from SOX-expressing cells. NT denotes the no template control. the majority of the sequences within this band terminated at a single nucleotide or within few nucleotides of each other. analysis of the sequences surrounding the cleavage site revealed a conserved stretch of five bases (TGAAG) just upstream of the cleavage site. however, insertion of this sequence alone (nt 131\u2013138) or of a 25-nucleotide stretch (nt 126\u2013150) surrounding the clea Mutation of one of the catalytic residues in BGLF5 (D203S) abolished the ability of SOX to deplete GFP mRNA in cells. mutation of any one of the catalytic residues abolished the ability of SOX to deplete GFP mRNA in cells. Western blots were performed using a probe directed against the 3\u2032 UTR of the DsRed2 mRNA or 18S (upper panels) Western blots showed expression of the SOX mutants and the level of Xrn1 depletion (lower panels) the degradation intermediate was not produced in either of the two mutants lacking RNA turnover activity. in vitro, SOX exhibits relatively weak affinity for RNA (K d of 87 M), suggesting that in cells it is recruited to mRNAs via associations with host factors [28]. the vast majority of mRNAs in the cytoplasm are polysome-associated [44], suggesting that targeting mRNAs engaged in translation would be an efficient mechanism to clear host messages during host shutoff. to examine the effects of host shutoff on translating mRNAs, we performed polysome profiling of SOX appeared to sediment primarily with the ribonucleoprotein (RNP), 40S, and monosome fractions, and exhibited partial overlap with RPS3 (Figure 5B). Puromycin treatment disrupted polysomes but failed to alter the SOX sedimentation profile, arguing against a specific association with the 80S and polysome fractions. ng/ml 2-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate for 24 h to stimulate KSHV replication. then subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation using 15\u201360% sucrose gradient. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated construct and subjected to sucrose gradient fractionation. the failure of SOX to degrade this mRNA in the cytoplasm could be due to its translational incompetence. pol I and Pol III transcription does not result in the addition of the cap and poly(A) tail, mRNA modifications critical to translation initiation specifically associated with Pol II. 293T cells were transfected with control or Xrn1 shRNA-expressing constructs. RNA was then sorted for GFP fluorescence to generate a pure population of SOX-expressing and control cells prior to RNA extraction. RNA was transfected with either Pol I-driven GFP or Pol III-driven GFP reporters with or without increasing amounts of SOX (200\u2013600 ng) 293T cells were transfected with control or Xrn1 shRNAs. mRNA was Northern blotted with 3\u2032 GFP or 18S probes. arrowhead indicates the position of the SOX-induced cleavage product. a 50\u201370 nt adenylate-rich tract in the 5\u2032 UTR of PABPC has also been shown to repress translation of its message in an autoregulatory manner. in SOX-expressing cells, mRNAs are targeted for cleavage at an early step during translation. the degradation intermediate is absent in all fractions from cells expressing the SOX catalytic mutant D221S. gammaherpesvirus SOX homologs promote potent host shutoff. but it does so in a site-specific manner in cells and requires one or more cellular factors to recruit and/or position it on the mRNA substrate. endonuclease-mediated decay is associated with mRNA quality control pathways, such as NMD, which targets messages containing premature stop codons [36], [37], and No-Go decay (NGD), which destroys mRNAs that experience stalls in translation [49]. a few endonucleases that regulate decay of specific sets of otherwise normal mRNAs have also been described [10]. we hypothesize that the full element is a complex sequence or structure, perhaps degenerate, enabling it to be widespread among cellular mRNAs. we have not observed a role for the canonical 3\u2032-5\u2032 exosome exonuclease complex. one possibility is that another host 3\u2032-5\u2032exonuclease instead mediates degradation of the upstream fragment. activity of SOX occurs in a site-specific manner, whereas the published assays used generic RNAs. this would allow the virus to selectively eliminate competing host mRNAs, while sparing regulatory RNAs that may be necessary for its own gene expression. RNAs adopt secondary and tertiary structures within a cell. this distance could be bridged if there was an additional interaction of SOX with a host protein co-factor bound to the cleavage element. this is the first example of a viral protein working in concert with host RNA turnover components to broadly target cellular messages. gammaherpesvirus SOX homologs promote potent host shutoff. cleavages enable rapid mRNA turnover, because they generate unprotected RNA ends while bypassing the requirement for deadenylation and decapping. recent studies have described previously unappreciated contributions of eukaryotic endonucleases to other basic processes such as miRNA-mediated mRNA decay [50], ER stress responses [51], [52], and exosome-mediated decay [53], [54], [55]. a key finding is that a primary role of SOX during host shutoff is to mediate endonucleolytic cleavage of target mRNAs. we have not observed a role for the canonical 3\u2032-5\u2032 exosome exonuclease complex. another host 3\u2032-5\u2032exonuclease instead mediates degradation of the upstream fragment. this might explain the limited protection of the 5\u2032 fragment afforded by exosome knockdown in studies of another eukaryotic endonuclease [36] eukaryotic translation initiates with the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the cap via interactions with translation initiation factors. two observations indicate recognition and turnover in SOX-expressing cells are initiated prior to 60S joining. insertion in the 5\u2032 UTR of elements that presumably inhibit or prematurely terminate 40S scanning does not affect SOX activity. viruses have adopted remarkably similar strategies to execute mRNA decay, resembling those of host pathways like NMD. the advantage for the virus may be that this strategy of host shutoff generates intermediates that look indistinguishable from those of host pathways like NMD. Western blots were performed with either mouse monoclonal anti-GFP (12000, BD Biosciences), mouse monoclonal anti-dsRed (1500, Clontech), mouse monoclonal anti-HA (12000, Invitrogen), mouse monoclonal anti-RPS3 (11000, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal anti-PAIP2A (1400, kindly provided by N. Sonenberg [70]. rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant maltose binding protein (MPB)-fused hRrp41 purified from E. coli. total cellular RNA was isolated for Northern blotting using RNA-Bee. hRNA sequences used in the study are detailed in Supplemental Materials and Methods (Text S1). cell extracts, Western blots, and Northern Blots Protein lysates were either prepared in RIPA buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) nonidet P-40, 0.5% (w/v) sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% (w/v) sodium dodecyl rabbit polyclonal antibodies were raised against recombinant maltose binding protein (MPB)-fused hRrp41 purified from E. coli. total cellular RNA was isolated for Northern blotting using RNA-Bee (Tel-Test) 293T cells were transfected with control or Xrn1 siRNAs. mRNA was subjected to Northern blotting using 3\u2032 end-directed probes. a flaviviral Xrn1-blocking element (SLII) was inserted at different positions within the GFP mRNA, as indicated in the diagram (C) mRNA in SOX-expressing cells is not stabilized by depletion of proteins involved in decapping or 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 degradation. the insertion of two SLII elements results in accumulation of protected RNA fragments even in the absence of SOX. the appearance of the protected fragments is reduced in the presence of the Dcp2 dominant negative (DN) mutant. 293T cells were treated with control siRNAs or siRNAs against the decapping complex proteins Dcp1A and Dcp2 or the exonuclease Xrn1. they were then transfected with GFP in the presence of SOX. western blots demonstrate level of protein depletion after siRNA treatment. Figure S3 5\u2032 RACE analysis of the degradation intermediate reveals a predominant cleavage site preceded by a conserved 5-mer. numbers below the sequence indicate the number of clones sequenced that ended at the marked nucleotide. all the catalytic residues (E184, D221, E244, K246) were required for host shutoff. some (R139, S144, Q376) were dispensable. others (W135, S146, S219) were dispensable. 293T cells were transfected with increasing amounts (100\u2013300 ng) of GFP or a 5\u2032A60-GFP construct containing a stretch of adenosines in the 5\u2032 UTR. total RNA was transfected with either Pol I-driven GFP (E) or Pol III-driven GFP (F) reporter constructs in the absence of SOX."}
