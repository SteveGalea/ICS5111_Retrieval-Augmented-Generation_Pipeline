{"summary": "melatonin, a hormone produced by the pineal gland, is entrained by the light/dark cycle and performs important functions in the biological regulation of circadian rhythms, antioxidant protection, bone physiology, and aging [3-6] melatonin is entrained by the light/dark cycle and performs important functions in the biological regulation of circadian rhythms, antioxidant protection, bone physiology, and aging. onin exerts its actions primarily through specific receptors, which has been described in different tissues and species. melatonin receptors act primarily through G-protein uncoupling, receptor downregulation, internalization, and phosphorylation. melatonin receptors act primarily through receptor downregulation, internalization, and phosphorylation, which could contribute to regulation of melatonin receptors. antibodies for total-ERK1/2 (t-ERK1/2), phospho-ERK1/2 (p-ERK1/2), total-CREB (t-CREB), phospho-CREBser133 (p-CREB), total-p90RSK (t-p90RSK),

permeated for 5 min with PBS/0.5% Triton X-100. cells were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with the p-CREB antibody, washed three times with PBS with Tween 20 luciferase activity was measured using a dual Luciferase Kit. real-time RT-PCR RNA extraction and reverse-transcriotion PCR were performed as described previously. a horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody was applied for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. blots were visualized with enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system. protein levels were normalized to the corresponding glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase band. cAMP levels Cellular cAMP levels were quantified using Cyclic AMP EIA Kit. cells were seeded in 12-well plates and cultured for 18-24 h at 37\u00b0C. then treated for 30 min with 2 mM melatonin and/or 20 M PP2. results are displayed as the percent absorbance at 490 nm relative to untreated cells at 0 h. results are shown as the mean S.E.M. *P 0.05 or **P 0.01 compared with control cells. effects of melatonin receptor on osteoblast proliferation Melatonin may act by binding to the MT1 and MT2 receptors. melatonin inhibited the phosphorylation of p90RSK and CREB. melatonin inhibited the phosphorylation of p90RSK and CREB. melatonin-treated group had less fluorescent staining than controls. melatonin decreased the phosphorylated expression of p90RSK and CREB in osteoblast cells. melatonin treatment reduced fluorescent staining, especially nuclear localization. treatment with PD98059 increased the level of CREB phosphorylation. all experiments were performed in triplicate and data shown as the mean S.E.M. *P 0.05 or **P 0.01, compared to controls. melatonin inhibited expression of phosphorylated Src, compared with controls. melatonin inhibited expression of phosphorylated Src, compared with controls. melatonin-treated cells were treated with melatonin (2 mM) for 24 or 48 h. expression of phosphorylated Src decreased expression of phosphorylated Src in osteoblast cells. protein levels were normalized to the corresponding GAPDH band. expression levels of p-ERK and p-CREB were remarkably reduced in the melatonin-treated group. melatonin decreased cAMP levels in osteoblasts, but co-treatment with PP2 had no further effect. blot to determine the effect of CREB on PCNA at the protein level. cells treated with melatonin exhibited reduced PCNA expression compared to controls. no significant change was observed between 24 and 48 h. melatonin inhibited hFOB 1.19 proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner, compared with untreated controls. all experiments were performed in triplicate and data are shown as the mean S.E.M. melatonin receptor may act by binding to the MT1 and MT2 receptors. both receptors are G-protein-coupled, PTX-sensitive membrane receptors. a melatonin receptor antagonist (luzindole; 10 M) could block the inhibitory effect of melatonin on osteoblast proliferation. melatonin inhibited the phosphorylation of p90RSK and CREB. melatonin-treated group had less fluorescent staining than controls. this suggests that melatonin might influence gene transcription via p-CREB. melatonin treatment reduced phosphorylation of p90RSK

CREB activation requires phosphorylation of the ser-133 region of the kinase inducible domain. melatonin treatment reduced CRE-luciferase activity, after transfection with a CRE-luc plasmid. cAMP content of bone tissue has been implicated in orthopedic diseases through the cAMP/PKA pathway. cAMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitor H89 activated CREB phosphorylation, along with substantial increases in p-ERK1/2 and p-p90RSK expression. transduction cascades contribute to regulation of CREB expression. melatonin regulates the activity of downstream kinases such as Ras, c-Raf, or ERK. cAMP-PKA and Src pathways are involved in melatonin-induced regulation of osteoblast proliferation. melatonin mediates CRE-dependent gene transcription in osteoblasts. melatonin is a CREB-related gene that is expressed at high levels. melatonin activates Src via a parallel signaling pathway."}
