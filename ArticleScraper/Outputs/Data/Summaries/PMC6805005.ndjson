{"summary": "many predictive studies were published during the 2016\u20132017 Zika Virus pandemic. it remains unknown how timely, reproducible, and actionable the information produced by these studies was. results 2034 studies were identified, of which n = 73 met eligibility criteria. many ZIKV predictions were published during the 2016\u20132017 pandemic. accessibility, reproducibility, timeliness, and incorporation of uncertainty in these published predictions varied. to enhance the utility of analytical tools for outbreak response it is essential to improve the sharing of model data. a range of statistical and mathematical models predicted the spread and other epidemic dynamics of ZIKV, as well as the burden of its complications. the WHO PHEIC status was lifted in November 2016 and the neotropical Zika pandemic has waned. this exercise is critical, not only due to the ongoing risk of Zika globally, but also to inform modeling efforts for future major epidemics. a panel of 12 investigators developed the systematic review protocol. no formal protocol was published for this systematic review. literature search strategy We conducted a literature review using EMBASE and MEDLINE (PubMed) simulated any epidemiological or ecological phenomena about the Zika pandemic. included but not limited to spatial spread risk, host and ecological range, disease and complication burden, economic impact transmission, and other epidemic dynamics. erJ Preprints, and wellcome Open Research manually searched arXiv and bioRxiv archives to confirm pre-print availability. a two-reviewer approach was used to ascertain whether eligible studies were made available as pre-print. all articles identified through the above literature search were screened by reviewing the title and abstract to remove all articles that clearly did not meet the eligibility criteria. the full text of the remaining articles was reviewed by two reviewers, with a third reviewer if not reached by the first two reviewers. the availability of preprint manuscripts was assessed using the pre-print search webtool search.bioPreprint [32], a server which identifies preprints from arXiv, bioRxiv, F1000Research, PeerJ Preprints, and Wellcome Open Research. a two-reviewer approach was used to ascertain whether eligible studies were made available as pre-print. predictions were concentrated in the Americas (42%) and Asia-Pacific (21%), while few studies were from Africa (4%). the most commonly used data were infection case counts, vector data, and demographic data, followed by climate, meteorological, earth science, and transport data. those studies where unable or no basis to judge bSome studies used multiple data types cViremia duration and dynamics (n = 3); sexual contact network (n = 2); semen viral persistence (n = 2), non-human primate demographics (n = 1), mammalian diversity (n = 1) dSome studies included >1 geographic category Table 2.
