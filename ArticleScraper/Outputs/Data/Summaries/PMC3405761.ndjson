{"summary": "the temporal and spatio-temporal incidence depend on complex factors related to the transmission of infection and the properties of the hosts. the transmission of infection is stochastic, meaning that a healthy host is infected by contact with inoculum from an infected host with a certain probability only. a methodological framework aims to estimate the probability that an emerging epidemic will invade a significant fraction of the population in the future. our results suggest that the most precise methods do not necessarily lead to more reliable predictions. instead, parsimony seems to be the key ingredient for prediction based on inherently limited observations. in step (iii), we have used several methods for fitting: minimum distance (MD), approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and data-augmented Markov chain Monte Carlo (DA-MCMC) these steps are interconnected and we argue they should be kept at a similar level of complexity in order to make their interplay as consistent as possible. the RF dynamics used in methods E and F are parametrized by the transmissibility, T, and a time scale. the RF dynamics corresponds to the limit k of the CT dynamics. the MD method for fitting consists in minimizing the parameter d2 (last column), which measures the difference between observations and numerical simulations. the central agar dot in ensembles with the geometry shown in figure 1 was inoculated by the soil-borne fungal plant pathogen R. solani. the spread of the fungal colony is scored in discrete time steps (e.g. daily) probability density function (p.d.f.) (T) is obtained by running many RF epidemics with random transmissibility. the probability of an invasive epidemic can be calculated by equation (2.1) which involves the conditional probability of invasion Pinv (T;L) for any given T (dashed line in d(i)) the main details of all the methodologies are summarized in table 1. the methodology C is mainly used for illustration of our concepts. the motivation for choosing methodology C is twofold: (i) it keeps all the steps for prediction of the behaviour at a similar level of complexity. we describe the evolution of the epidemic in terms of a spatial susceptible\u2013infected\u2013removed (SIR) epidemiological model where the hosts can be either susceptible (S), infected (I) or removed (R). this paradigm has been shown to be appropriate for description of fungal invasion [23,27,28]. a given observed spatio-temporal map for infection can occur for different values of the estimated transmissibility, T. however, some of these values for T are more likely to produce the observed spatio-temporal pattern than others. to account for this, we introduce the probability density function (p.d.f.), (T), which quantifies the probability that the observed spatio-temporal pattern is reproduced. bs(l,t) approximately rather than necessarily with distance df2 = 0. This approach is similar to the approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) method that determines (T) as the histogram of values of T for which df2 is a parameter used in the method [32]. both ABC and MD algorithms give similar results despite the fact that MD does not require the use of an additional parameter. agar dots were placed on a triangular lattice. the invasive and non-invasive state of the epidemic was estimated for each replicate by observing the initial evolution of colonization during tobs = 10 days. the corresponding mean over replicates with the same value is shown by the solid line. the mean probability of invasion Pexp obtained by counting the relative number of invasive epidemics after 21 days is shown by the solid line. in order to make a proper comparison between the experimental observations with the RF model used in methods A\u2013D, it is necessary to rescale the time step of the RF dynamics with dimensionless = 1. figure 4 shows the average over replicates of T and T as a function of the lattice spacing. these estimates correspond to observations of the evolution of infection during tobs = 21 days. the uncertainty in T exhibits greater variations between methodologies. however, the value of T on its own does not necessarily provide a good approximation for because the width of (T) can bring a significant contribution to the integral in equation. each symbol gives the average of (a) T and (b) T over six replicates of the experiments for each lattice spacing, a. the p.d.f.'s (T) obtained with MCMC show no systematic trend with respect to other methods. DA-MCMC involves the inference of the unobserved colonization times and thus is intrinsically individual-based, in contrast to shell-based (or mean-field) methods. for methods A\u2013D, we compare the incidence and shell-evolution function obtained numerically with values for T and sampled from estimated by means of the spatio-temporal maps. c gives the typical deviation of the simulated incidence per unit host at a given time, csim(t), from the observed incidence per host at the same time, cobs(t). c gives the typical deviation of the simulated shell-evolution function, Fsim, evaluated at any spatio-temporal coordinates (l,t) from the observed value at the same coordinates. the mean value of r.m.s. distances is obtained by averaging over 104 stochastic realizations of simulations. the approximate methods C\u2013E perform better than even methodology F (triangles in figure 5), despite the fact that the latter aims for a more precise spatio-temporal description. estimated by counting the fraction of replicates in which the fungus has reached the six outer edges of the experimental system by 21 days. averaged over replicates with the same value of a gives a reasonable estimate for the observed mean of Pexp (solid circles in figure 2a) after t = 21 days. the mean value of r.m.s. distances is obtained by averaging over stochastic realizations of simulations and over six replicates for each lattice spacing,. simulations are based on fittings to observations over tobs = 10 days. some probability to invade a system of size L = 51 for t > 21 days. both infectivity and susceptibility are expected to be subject to heterogeneity in the agar-dot system. the p.d.f.'s (T) obtained with different fitting methodologies are plotted for the fungal colony invasion in a population of agar dots with lattice spacing a = 10 mm. different symbol types correspond to different fitting methodologies, as marked in the legend. the only difference is a trend for (T) corresponding to CT dynamics to have a \u2018heavy tail\u2019 for large values of T. large values of T are correlated with large values of the time scale 0 (i.e. slower processes with high T) and small values of the shape parameter k, that are ruled out by the RF model. this effect becomes more important for larger values of the lattice spacing. r.m.s. distances are compared with experimental observations by running numerical epidemics with parameters for the CT dynamics sampled from the p.d.f. 3 (T, 0, k) we make a quantitative comparison based on squared distances dc2 and df2 between simulated epidemics and experimental fungal invasions. c is expected because reproducing the spatio-temporal evolution represented by F(l,t) is more demanding than capturing the temporal evolution of the colonization given by c(t) both c and F tend to be larger for a around 10\u201312 mm which corresponds to cases that are close to the invasion threshold. approximate methods C\u2013E perform better than even methodology F (triangles in figure 5), despite the fact that the latter aims for a more precise spatio-temporal description. the time interval used to calculate c and F from equations (3.1) and (3.2) is t = 11 days. the relative trends of c and F between methods and lattice spacings are similar to those reported in figure 5 for the comparison between observations and numerical simulations with tobs. the results of applying each of the prediction methods are shown in figure 2b for the mean probability averaged over replicates for each value of a. all the methods except E give similar predictions for. the large values of predicted by method E are a consequence of the \u2018heavy tail\u2019 of the p.d.f. (T), which gives a significant weight to the high values of Pinv for large T in equation (2.1) in this section, we present a sensitivity analysis of our methods by applying them to prediction of invasion for numerically simulated epidemics. the main factor compromising predictability is the intrinsic stochasticity in transmission of infection. the advantage in this case with respect to more realistic situations is that both the transmissibility, T, and the probability of invasion, Pinv(T;L) are known. the distribution (T) allows the probability of invasion in the system of size L = 51 to be estimated using equation (2.1) the distribution (T) is represented by a horizontal slice of the shaded area in figure 7 (see the slice along the dashed blue line corresponding to with darker colour corresponding to higher probability relative to the maximum of (T) estimate of probability of invasion Pinv(T;L) is compared with the probability Pinv(T;L) that would be obtained if the exact value of T was known a priori (see line marked by circles in figure 7). this means that the estimations are biased upwards and most likely is that the actual probability of invasion will be smaller than predicted. a similar approach has been used to deal with more realistic epidemics where the transmission of infection is heterogeneous. the estimated for such epidemics usually gives a bound to the actual probability of invasion that is even safer than that obtained for cases with homogeneous transmissibility. method to be used for obtaining the most reliable prediction depends on the problem in hand. a reasonable method should use as much information as available from observations. the proposed methods assume epidemics can be described by an effective transmissibility that is constant over time and homogeneous in space. our methods have been applied under the assumption that the network of contacts between hosts remains unchanged during the course of epidemics. this condition is clearly satisfied for the fungal colony invasion of the population of agar dots considered here. a possible strategy to make predictions in this kind of networks would involve inferring the mixing parameter for contacts based on observations. if it were possible to determine the exact value of the parameters, it would still be impossible to predict with absolute certainty if the epidemic is going to be invasive or not. there exists a prediction horizon beyond which the uncertainty of predictions of the evolution of the epidemic is too large for predictions to be useful. the methods proposed in this paper may not work when applied for prediction of catastrophic events in nonlinear dynamical systems. but the ideas presented here together with approaches proposed for prediction in nonlinear dynamical systems may help in devising strategies for prediction in stochastic nonlinear systems."}
