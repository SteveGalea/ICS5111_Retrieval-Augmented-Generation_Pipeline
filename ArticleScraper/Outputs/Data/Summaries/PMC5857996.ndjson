{"summary": "MCs are a large family of membrane proteins that transport nucleotides, amino acids, carboxylic acids, inorganic ions, and cofactors across the mitochondrial inner membrane (1\u20133) many metabolic pathways and cellular processes with complete or partial localization in the mitochondrial matrix are dependent on transport steps catalyzed by MCs. ize MCs from A. thaliana were initiated by comparing selected Arabidopsis genes with those of yeast and humans encoding MCs with previously identified substrates. it is important to note that some of the carriers characterized from Arabidopsis have broader substrate specificities than their human and yeast counterparts. protein 1 (UCP1) was demonstrated to transport protons, thereby uncoupling oxidative phosphorylation (32, 33) on the basis of homology with subsequently sequenced MCs, a UCP subfamily was identified. however, atUCP4\u20136 were subsequently renamed dicarboxylate carriers (DIC1\u20133) following the demonstration that they transport malate, oxaloacetate, succinate, Pi, sulfate, thios atUCP1 and AtUCP2 homologs were collected, aligned, and analyzed. atUCP1 and AtUCP2 share 72% identical amino acids. their sequences are much more similar to each other than to any other Arabidopsis protein. the apparent molecular masses of purified AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were 31 kDa. the identities of the recombinant proteins were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. the yield of the purified proteins was about 10 and 2 mg/liter of culture for AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 respectively. recombinant AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were reconstituted into liposomes. their transport activities for various radioactive substrates were tested in homo-exchange experiments. both atUCP1- and AtUCP2-mediated homo-exchanges between external [14C]aspartate and internal aspartate were temperature-dependent. no transport was observed with glutamine, arginine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, proline, -aminobutyrate, citrate, ATP, GTP, S-adenosylmethionine, or glutathione. at least three independent experiments were conducted. atUCP1 and AtUCP2, the highest activities were observed in the presence of internal aspartate, glutamate, cysteine sulfinate, cysteate, malonate, malate, oxaloacetate, maleate. both proteins exchanged, albeit to lower extent, internal d-aspartate, cysteine, oxalate, succinate, 2-oxoglutarate, -aminoadipate, Pi, s transport was started by adding 0.8 mm [14C]aspartate and stopped after 7 and 20 s for AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 respectively. effects of other mitochondrial carrier inhibitors on the exchange reaction catalyzed by reconstituted AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were also examined. mercuric chloride (HgCl2), carboxyatractyloside (CAT) and bongkrekic acid (BKA) were added 2 min before labeled substrate. the other inhibitors were added together with [14C]aspartate. constants 1.6 and 1.4 min1 (AtUCP1) or 0.27 and 0.23 min1 (AtUCP2); initial rates 14 and 11 mmol/min g of protein (AtUCP1) or 1.9 and 1.3 mmol/min g of protein (AtUCP2) were observed. liposomes reconstituted either with AtUCP1 or AtUCP2 suggesting that the two proteins catalyze a minor unidirectional transport (uniport zed by both AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 was observed. however, in the presence of external substrates, the efflux transport rates were at least one order of magnitude higher. these experiments demonstrate that AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 are capable of catalyzing both a rapid antiport of substrates. Efflux of [14C]aspartate (A and B) and [14C]malate (C and D) was started by adding 5 mm aspartate (), malate (), glutamate (), 5 mm NaCl and no substrate (), and 5 mm aspartate (A and B) together with 20 mm pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate and 20 mm bathophenanthroline (). similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments. the initial rates of the indicated homo-exchanges were started by adding appropriate concentrations of labeled substrate to proteoliposomes preloaded internally with the same substrate (10 mm). the reaction time was 7 and 20 s for AtUCP1 and AtUCP2, respectively. the values are means S.E. of at least three independent experiments carried out in duplicate. 0.3 2.3 0.2 Glutamate 2.2 0.2 2.3 0.2 Malate 1.7 0.2 2.2 0.2 Oxaloacetate 2.6 0.3 3.2 0.2 Sulfate 3.6 0.3 3.3 0.3 Influence of membrane potential and pH gradient on the [14C]aspartate/glutamate exchange catalyzed by recombinant AtUCP1 and AtUCP2. out/aspartatein (Table 3) and malateout/glutamatein (data not shown) were unaffected by valinomycin in the presence of a K+ gradient of 1:50. a pH difference was created by the addition of the K+/H+ exchanger nigericin to proteoliposomes in the presence of a K+ gradient of 1:50. valinomycin or nigericin was added in 10 l ethanol/ml of proteoliposomes. the exchange reactions were stopped after 7, 20, and 30 s for AtUCP1, AtUCP2, and AGC2-CTD respectively. the values are means S.E. of four independent experiments carried out in duplicate. fluorescent signals of AtUCP1-/AtUCP2-GFP (green), mitochondrial marker IVD-eqFP611 (red), chlorophyll A/chloroplasts (blue) and merge showing the overlap of the fluorescent signals (yellow) detected via confocal laser-scanning microscopy. metabolic phenotypes of ucp1/ucp2 double mutant tend to be similar to those of ucp1. changes in phenylalanine, serine, the branched chain amino acids, ornithine, myo-inositol, putrescine, and AMP were apparent in one or more of the genotypes. atUCP1 and AtUCP2 share 72% identical amino acids. closest homologs are hUCP2 (34), having 51 and 44% identical amino acids, and yeast Dic1p (40), exhibiting 30 and 33% sequence identity with AtUCP2 and hUCP2 respectively. P1 and AtUCP2 were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) strains. they accumulated as inclusion bodies and were purified by centrifugation and washing. the identities of the purified proteins were confirmed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. the same number of bacteria were analyzed in each sample. Lanes 5 and 8, purified AtUCP1 protein (5 g) and purified AtUCP2 (3 g) derived from bacteria shown in lanes 4 and 7 respectively. the same number of bacteria were analyzed in each sample. AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 were found to catalyze homo-exchanges of glutamate, malonate, malate, succinate, and Pi. no or very low transport was observed with glutamine, arginine, phenylalanine, threonine, valine, proline, -aminobutyrate, citrate, ATP, GTP, S-adenosylmethionine, or glutathione. the reaction was terminated after 30 min. the values are means S.E. (error bars) of at least three experiments. activity in the presence of these substrates was approximately the same as that observed in the presence of NaCl and no substrate. transport was started by adding 0.8 mm [14C]aspartate and stopped after 7 and 20 s for AtUCP1 (A) and AtUCP2 (B), respectively. the incubation time was 7 and 20 s for AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 respectively. the other inhibitors were added together with [14C]aspartate. similar results were obtained in at least three independent experiments. the [14C]aspartate/aspartate and [14C]malate exchanges followed first-order kinetics (rate constants 1.6 and 1.4 min1 (AtUCP1) or 0.27 and 0.23 min1 (AtUCP2). liposomes reconstituted either with AtUCP1 or AtUCP2 suggesting that the two proteins catalyze a minor unidirectional transport (uniport) of substrates. Efflux of [14C]aspartate and [14C]malate from AtUCP1- and AtUCP2-reconstituted liposomes was observed in the absence of external substrates. however, in the presence of external substrates, the efflux transport rates were at least one order of magnitude higher. Efflux of [14C]aspartate (A and B) and [14C]malate (C and D) was started by adding 5 mm aspartate (), malate (), glutamate (), 5 mm NaCl and no substrate (), and 5 mm aspartate (A and B) together with 20 mm pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate and 20 mm bathophenanthroline (). the transport was terminated at the indicated times. the inhibition constants (Ki) of these compounds are listed in Table 2. Table 1. Kinetic constants of recombinant AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 The values were calculated from linear regression of double reciprocal plots of the initial rates of the indicated homo-exchanges versus the external substrate concentration. the exchanges were started by adding appropriate concentrations of labeled substrate to proteoliposomes preloaded internally with the same substrate (10 mm). the reaction time was 7 and 20 s for At inhibitor Ki AtUCP1 AtUCP2 mm -Ketoglutarate 3.3 0.2 2.6 0.2 Cysteate 2.2 0.3 2.4 0.2 Cysteinesulfinate 2.7 0.3 2.3 0.2 Glutamate 2.2 0.2 2.3 0.2 Malate 1.7 0.2 2.2 0.2 Oxaloacetate 2.6 0.3 3.2 0.2 Sulfate 3.6 0.3 3.3 0.3 Influence of membrane potential and pH gradient on the the atUCP1- and AtUCP2-mediated aspartate/aspartate, malate/malate, and malateout/aspartatein (Table 3) and malateout/glutamatein (data not shown) were unaffected by valinomycin in the presence of a K+ gradient of 1:50. a pH difference was created by the addition of the K+/H+ exchanger nigericin to proteoliposomes. m [14C]aspartate was added to proteoliposomes reconstituted with AGC2-CTD. Kin+ was in included as KCl in the reconstitution mixture. Kout+ was added as KCl together with the labeled substrate. Valinomycin or nigericin was added in 10 l ethanol/ml of proteoliposomes. 20 mm or 2 mm PIPES (pH 7.0) was present inside and outside fluorescent signals of AtUCP1-/AtUCP2-GFP (green), mitochondrial marker IVD-eqFP611 (red), chlorophyll A/chloroplasts (blue) and merge showing the overlap of the fluorescent signals (yellow) detected via confocal laser-scanning microscopy. a, co-localization of AtUCP1-GFP with the mitochondrial marker. the expression of the ucp2 gene was virtually absent in the newly isolated ucp2 mutant. we then assessed their metabolic phenotypes via GC-MS\u2013based metabolic profiling. the effects of salt stress were investigated because UCPs have been previously proposed to contribute to the abiotic stress response. s were grown on the plates containing 0, 50, and 75 mm NaCl for 12 days. the relative levels of malate (A), fumarate (B), citrate (C) and pyruvate (D) were normalized to the mean of those of wildtype plants grown on the plate without salt. extent, d-aspartate, cysteine, oxalate, succinate, Pi, sulfate, and thiosulfate. atUCP2 also transports fumarate, glutarate, and nitrate to some extent. both proteins catalyze a highly efficient counterexchange of substrates. atUCP1 and AtUCP2 differ greatly from AtUCP4\u20136 (previously demonstrated to be dicarboxylate carriers) and suggest that they also differ from AtUCP3, which displays only 35 and 37% identical amino acids with AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 respectively. previous analyses of AtUCP1 knockout mutants revealed impaired photorespiration due to a dramatic decrease in mitochondrial glycine oxidation rate. this led to the suggestion of a physiological role of AtUCP1 in the glycolate pathway by playing a role in the transfer of reducing equivalents across the mitochondrial inner membrane. peroxisomal hydroxypyruvate reductase oxidizes NADH to NAD+. this implies that the reducing equivalents of NADH are transported from the mitochondria to the peroxisomes as malate. atUCP1 (and AtUCP2) would catalyze an exchange of aspartateout for glutamatein across the inner mitochondrial membrane, thus contributing to the export of reducing equivalents of NADH from mitochondria. metabolites are present in the cytosol at very high concentrations (about 20 mm) (50), which are much higher than those of 2-oxoglutarate, malate, and oxaloacetate. both mitochondrial glutamate-oxaloacetate transaminase and malate dehydrogenase are involved in the regeneration of NAD+ by GDC in mitochondria. affinities of AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 for aspartate are much higher than those for other substrates. affinities of AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 for aspartate are much higher than those for other substrates. atUCP1 and AtUCP2 could be incorporated into 2-oxoglutarate by mitochondrial glutamate dehydrogenase. glutamate is exported to the cytoplasm in counterexchange with external 2-oxoglutarate. this would provide a new acceptor molecule for the glutamate dehydrogenase reaction. amplified gene fragments were cloned into pMW7 (AtUCP1) and pRUN (AtUCP2) vectors. transformants were selected on LB (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.4) plates containing 100 g/ml ampicillin. the mixture contained solubilized proteins (about 6 g), 1% Triton X-114, 1.4% egg yolk phospholipids as sonicated liposomes, 10 mm substrate, 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0) and 1 mg of cardiolipin, and water to a final volume of 700 l. the mixture was recycled 13 times through a bio-Beads SM-2 column pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 proteoliposomes containing 5 mm internal aspartate or malate were loaded with 5 m [14C] aspartate and [14C]malate. external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through Sephadex G-75 columns pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl. Efflux was started by adding unlabeled external substrate or buffer alone and terminated by adding the inhibitors indicated above. pDONR207 vector was ned into pDONR207 vector by a BP recombination reaction with BP Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen) the resulting entry clone was used for an LR recombination reaction by LR Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen) to construct expression vector for the expression of AtUCP2-GFP. Isolated protoplasts were resuspended in W5 solution (154 mm NaCl, 125 mm CaCl2, 5 mm KCl, 2 mm MES, pH 5.6) and directly used for microscopy. images were processed using Fiji software (75) and Adobe Photoshop CS6 (Adobe Systems) homozygous ucp1 and ucp2 were crossed by PCR in the T1 generation. total RNA was extracted from wildtype, mutant, and transgenic plants using the guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform method. the identity of the bacterially expressed, purified AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 was assessed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry of trypsin digests. the amount of purified AtUCP1 and AtUCP2 proteins was estimated by laser densitometry of stained samples using carbonic anhydrase as a protein standard. the amplified gene fragments were cloned into pMW7 (AtUCP1) and pRUN (AtUCP2) vectors. transformants were selected on LB (10 g/liter tryptone, 5 g/liter yeast extract, 5 g/liter NaCl, pH 7.4) plates containing 100 g/ml ampicillin. all constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. the mixture contained solubilized proteins (about 6 g), 1% Triton X-114, 1.4% egg yolk phospholipids as sonicated liposomes, 10 mm substrate, 20 mm PIPES (pH 7.0) and 1 mg of cardiolipin, and water to a final volume of 700 l. the mixture was recycled 13 times through a bio-Beads SM-2 column pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 proteoliposomes containing 5 mm internal aspartate or malate were loaded with 5 m [14C] aspartate and [14C]malate, respectively, by carrier-mediated exchange equilibrium (61, 62) external radioactivity was removed by passing the proteoliposomes through Sephadex G-75 columns pre-equilibrated with 50 mm NaCl. resulting entry clone was used for an LR recombination reaction with BP Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen) the resulting entry clone was used for an LR recombination reaction by LR Clonase II enzyme mix (Invitrogen) to construct expression vector for the expression of AtUCP2-GFP.
