{"summary": "high-throughput lab methods and bioinformatics are being rapidly translated into practical clinical and public health applications. new information technology infrastructure will be needed to handle the scale and complexity of genomic data. state laboratories provide critical reference functions to support diagnosis and treatment of unusual or reportable pathogens. new technology is also transforming clinical laboratories, where next-generation diagnostic tests based on the detection of nucleic acid sequences or other molecular markers are rapidly replacing traditional culture-based methods. fda has already approved many syndromic CIDT panels for enteric, respiratory, and invasive pathogens. syndromic CIDT panels could become a source of more complete data on infectious disease incidence than are currently available. syndromic CIDTs could become a source of more complete data on infectious disease incidence than are generally more sensitive and specific than culture-based diagnostic tests. widespread use of CIDTs requires clinical laboratories to perform fewer primary cultures for many organisms. widespread use of CIDTs requires clinical laboratories to perform fewer primary cultures for many organisms. many technical and logistical obstacles must be overcome before these techniques are practical and economical for routine testing. the CDC is responding to these new opportunities and challenges by leading the transformation of public health systems in a way that will maximize the timely availability, utility and quality of the information needed for action at every level. a range of activities is under way in CDC laboratories and programs and in state and local health departments to incorporate NGS and other new laboratory technologies into routine public health practice. the AMD initiative supports cross-cutting efforts that focus on (i) building shared computing and laboratory capacity for genomics, bioinformatics, and next-generation diagnostic testing. the program promotes coordination and standardization of next-generation sequencing protocols and bioinformatic methods across public health programs. state and local public health departments are being encouraged to form local or regional training networks. state and local public health departments are also being encouraged to form local or regional training networks, with one laboratory taking the lead. investigators can identify clusters of related illnesses and potential sources, even those resulting from a widely distributed food or other vehicle. foodborne disease outbreak investigations give the food industry and regulatory authorities the information they need to prevent future outbreaks. outbreak clusters detected and outbreaks solved before and after implementation of real-time whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of Listeria monocytogenes isolates from patients, food, and the environment, united states, September 2012 to August 2015. the CDC is currently helping to build WGS capacities in state health departments and develop whole-genome multilocus sequence typing databases. replacing PFGE with WGS promises to provide higher-resolution data for comparison in epidemiologic investigations. the per-isolate reagent cost for WGS is approximately 10- to 20-fold higher than for PFGE, but continues to fall. even greater savings can be achieved through laboratory automation and workflow consolidation. influenza virus evolves very rapidly through antigenic drift and reassortment. it is critical to identify prevalent variants quickly and monitor for emerging strains and changes in the cocirculating viral population dynamics. current laboratory surveillance procedures entail unavoidable delays. more than 1.2 million people in the united states are living with HIV infection. about 40,000 people become newly infected each year. in 2015, an outbreak of HIV infections occurred in a rural county of southeastern Indiana. each circle represents one case, with circle size proportional to number of epidemiologic or genetic connections. MERS was found to be a previously unknown coronavirus (18), now called Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) the CDC subsequently developed and validated additional diagnostic tests for MERS-CoV and distributed them to public health laboratories throughout the united states and in 48 other countries to date. CDC scientists used NGS to identify a previously unknown Thogotovirus. it was named Bourbon virus after the county where it was collected. improved surveillance, including NGS and broad-based molecular approaches, are likely to identify more such viruses. the CDC has engaged with several academic institutions to develop and deliver bioinformatics training to the CDC laboratory workforce through seminars, coursework, and hands-on technical workshops. the CDC has also introduced a new postdoctoral and postmasters fellowship program that gives bioinformaticians a chance to apply their skills to challenging public health problems. major efforts currently focus on harmonizing methods for laboratory proficiency testing and bioinformatic analysis of clinical and environmental samples for surveillance and investigation of foodborne disease. major efforts currently focus on harmonizing methods for laboratory proficiency testing and bioinformatic analysis of clinical and environmental samples for surveillance and investigation of foodborne disease. public health programs need enhanced and new capacities in bioinformatics and data science, supported by specialized data systems and software. diffusion of molecular technology throughout the network of U.S. public health laboratories means that data will eventually replace biological specimens as the currency in many routine transactions. the collaborative Listeria Whole Genome Sequencing Project demonstrated the feasibility of a population-based approach to collecting, curating, and sharing Listeria monocytogenes genome sequences from clinical and environmental isolates. most genetic sequence data, however, are either not actively archived, not curated, or inaccessible, leading some to propose community-based curation models. open data model for real-time sharing of pathogen genome sequences enables rapid access for basic science research and diagnostic development. public health agencies can play an important role in facilitating data sharing and encouraging research transparency while maintaining necessary controls over private health care information."}
