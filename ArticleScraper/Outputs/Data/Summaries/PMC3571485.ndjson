{"summary": "the transmission of the highly pathogenic avian influenza A virus has been rare. no human pandemic has ever occurred as a result of this virus. the first human case was reported to the WHO in 2003. since then, there have been 608 documented human H5N1 cases. inactivated virus vaccines and live-attenuated, cold-adapted vaccines could also be developed for the prevention of H5N1 virus infection via large-scale vaccination (10\u201312) other forms of H5N1 vaccines, including those based on DNA, proteins, viral vectors, and virus-like particles, are in the developmental stage or in preclinical or clinical trials. such vaccines are not effective enough against divergent strains of H5N1 viruses, thus limiting their ability to produce broad the HA of influenza virus plays important roles in virus infection by binding to target cells and fusing viral and cellular membranes. the trimeric protein of HA is initially synthesized as a precursor polypeptide, HA0, which is then activated upon cleavage into two subunits, HA1 and HA2. the stem region, HA2, mediates fusion of the viral envelope and cellular membrane. vaccinated mice were sacrificed 10 days after last boost. splenocytes were fused with mouse myeloma cells. positive cells were expanded, retested, and subcloned to generate stable hybridoma cell lines. the classification of the H5N1 pseudovirus was based on WHO recommendations. exogenous bacterial neuraminidase (NA) was added 24 and 48 h. supernatants were harvested at 72 h posttransfection for single-cycle infection. virus-infected cells were incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C. infectivity was identified by the presence of viral cytopathic effect. 96-well ELISA plates were coated with recombinant HA proteins. reactivity detection and epitope mapping of MAb HA-7 by ELISA. recombinant human IgG1-Fc2 protein (rFc), commercial human IgG Fc protein (igG-Fc), Fd fused with HIV-1 gp41 (HIV-Fd) and SARS-CoV RBD protein were used as the controls. serially diluted MAb was added to the plates and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the plates were washed three times with phosphate-buffered s the plates were treated with iodoacetamide (50 mM) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C to stop reaction. a virus binding assay was performed by using QH-HA H5N1 pseudovirus as previously described, with some modifications. percentage of viral entry was expressed as a relative percentage of the luciferase reading from the cells without antibodies (no Ab) total RNA was isolated from 107 hybridoma cells of HA-7 using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) cDNA was synthesized by using the superscript II RT-PCR kit (Invitrogen) chromatography using a superdex S200 10/300 column in a solution containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4), 50 mM NaCl, and 1 mM CaCl2. images were acquired by using a 4,000-by-4,000-pixel TVIPS charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera. the molecular structure of HA-7Fab was obtained from its published crystal structure (PDB accession no. 3FKU) the molecular structure of HA-7Fab was obtained by homologous modeling using Swiss-Model (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/) the homology model was adjusted manually with COOT (43) to remove atom clashes. ELISA plates coated with recombinant HA1 proteins fused with human Fc. recombinant hIgG1-Fc2 protein (rFc), commercial human IgG Fc protein (IgG-Fc), Fd fused with HIV-1 gp41 (HIV-Fd) and SARS-CoV RBD protein were used as the controls. the 3D-EM density map of the HA-7Fab/H5HA complex has been deposited in the EMDB database under accession number EMD-2074. the animal studies were carried out in strict accordance with recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health (28) the MAbs were purified from culture supernatants using protein A and G Sepharose 4 Fast Flow. an assay of the neutralizing activity of MAb HA-7 against infection by divergent clades of HA pseudovirus was performed. 293T cells were preplated in 96-well culture plates (104 cells/well) twenty-four hours later, cells were refed with fresh medium. luciferase substrate (Promega) was added to the plates, followed by lysing cells 72 h later with cell lysis buffer (Promega) mice were infected with 5 50% lethal doses (LD50) of VN/1194 or SZ/406H of H5N1 virus. the control group was given the same amount of MAb specific to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) six infected mice per group were sacrificed on day 5 postchallenge. the lung tissues of challenged mice were immediately fixed in 10% formalin and embedded in paraffin wax. sections 4 to 6 mm in thickness were made and mounted onto slides. reactivity detection and epitope mapping of MAb HA-7 were done by using ELISA plates coated with recombinant HA proteins. the plates were sequentially incubated with goat anti-mouse IgG3 (1:1,000) and anti-goat HRP-conjugated antibody (1:5,000) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the reaction was visualized by using the substrate 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) and stopped with 1 N H2SO4. the plates were then treated with iodoacetamide (50 mM) for 1 h at the lysed cells were quantified for HIV p24 by ELISA. percent virus binding was expressed as a relative percentage of the p24 reading from the cells without antibodies (no Ab), which was set as 100%. primers mVK-f (ATGGAGWCAGACACACTCCT) and mVK-r (GGATACAGTTGGTGCAGCATC) were used to amplify the genes encoding the heavy (H) chain. the amplified DNA fragments were cloned into T vector (Invitrogen) followed by selection of positive clones for sequencing. kV, at a magnification of 70,000, resulting in a calibrated pixel size of 4.28 /pixel on the specimen scale. defocus values were in the range of 2.0 to 3.2 m. the electron dosage was 40 electrons/2. the density of HA-7Fab was calculated by subtracting the density of HA from the complex's EM density. the receptor of avian influenza virus H5HA (sialic acid) was located according to the H5HA/receptor complex structure in the Protein Data Bank (accession no. 1JSN) commercial human IgG Fc protein (IgG-Fc), Fd fused with HIV-1 gp41 (HIV-Fd) and SARS-CoV RBD protein were used as the controls. the data are presented as the mean absorbance at 450 nm (A450) standard deviations. QH-HA, HK-HA, and HB-HA of H5N1 pseudovirus at a concentration as low as 0.7 g/ml, reaching inhibitory activity similar to that at 10 g/ml. further detection indicated that HA-7 could strongly neutralize infection by all tested H5N1 strains, including VN/1194, HK/213, and SZ/406H. HA-7 effectively inhibited the entry of divergent strains of H5N1 virus. mice were passively immunized i.v. with purified MAb HA-7. mice were sacrificed 5 days after challenge to detect viral titers. control group exhibited a continuous decrease of body weight. none of them survived more than 10 days after virus challenge. survival rate of HA-7-injected mice after challenge with 5 LD50. HA-7-injected mice were challenged with 5 LD50 of clade 1 strain VN/1194 and clade 2.3.4 strain SZ/406H of H5N1. lung tissues were collected at day 5 postchallenge. data are expressed as means standard deviation of virus titers. serious histopathological damage was seen in the control mice. bronchial epithelial cell degeneration, necrosis, and desquamation. HA-7-immunized mice showed only mild interstitial pneumonia changes. neutralizing HA-7 MAb was found to belong to the IgG1 subtype. the amino acid sequences of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of HA-7Fab were analyzed. HA-7 recognized a highly conserved region in HA1 of H5N1. HA-7 reacted strongly with the proteins covering full-length HA1. clades 0, 1, 1, 1.1, 2.2, 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.3.2, 2.3.2.1, 2.3.4, 2.3.4.1, 2.3.4.2, 2.3.4.3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are highly conserved among analyzed strains of H5N1 viruses. ELISA plates were coated with truncated recombinant HA1 protein fragments covering the full-length HA1 region, followed by the addition of MAb HA-7 to HA-7 had strong reactivity with native forms of these HA1 proteins fused with the trimeric motif Fd and immunoenhancer Fc. HA-7 had very low reactivity with the overlapping peptides covering the full-length HA protein of H5N1. a MAb to the RBD of SARS-CoV (33G4) and human IgG-Fc were used as the negative controls. the data are presented as mean percentages standard deviation for duplicated wells. iterative 3D refinement with a total of 3,172 particle images was done by using EMAN2 until it converged with no significant visual changes checked by Chimera. the effective resolution of this final 3D reconstruction is 18.0 based on the criterion of an FSC coefficient of 0.5 (see Fig. S2D in the supplemental material) residues 81 to 83 and 117 to 122 of HA1 (black) are in contact with Fab. the receptor (sialic acid [light blue spheres] is in the background. monoclonal hybridomas were screened against the HA1 fragment (HA1-His) HA-7 was shown to inhibit over 95% of viral entry for both the homologous AH-HA strain and heterologous strains XJ-HA, QH-HA, HK-HA, and HB-HA of H5N1 pseudovirus at a concentration as low as 0.7 g/ml. further detection of the neutralizing activity of the MAb indicated that HA-7 could strongly neutralize infection by all tested H5N1 strains. data for neutralizing activities of HA-7 against strains VN/1194 (clade 1), SZ/406H (clade 2.3.4) and HK/213 (clade 1) of H5N1; S-OIV H1N1 (A/Beijing/501/2009 pdm strain); and seasonal IAVs. panels A and B show representative data from three independent repeat experiments. no obvious body weight loss was observed for the mice immunized with MAb HA-7 after challenge with a lethal infection by the VN/1194 or SZ/406H strain of H5N1 virus. the mice in the SARS-CoV RBD control group exhibited a continuous decrease of body weight. HA-7-injected mice challenged with clade 1 strain VN/1194 and clade 2.3.4 strain SZ/406H of H5N1 virus. titers and histopathological changes in the lungs of mice injected with a MAb. b to the RBD of SARS-CoV and those from uninfected mice were used as the negative control (Ctrl) and normal control (Normal), respectively. bronchial epithelial cell degeneration, necrosis, and desquamation were seen in the control mice. this MAb was found to belong to the IgG1 subtype after coating of the ELISA plate with a HA1-specific recombinant protein (HA1-His) the amino acid sequences of the heavy (VH) and light (VL) chains of HA-7Fab were analyzed. the epitope mapping of HA-7 was initially done by using ELISA plates coated with truncated recombinant HA fragments covering the full length of the ELISA plates were coated with truncated recombinant HA1 protein fragments covering the full-length HA1 region. the data are presented as mean A450 values standard deviations of data from duplicate wells of MAbs at a dilution of 1:3,200. ELISA plates were coated with recombinant HA1 proteins and then treated with DTT to break the disulfide bonds of these proteins. HA-7 had strong reactivity with native forms of these HA1 proteins fused with the trimeric motif Fd and immunoenhancer Fc. further detection indicated that this MAb had very low reactivity. HA-7 inhibited virus entry in a dose-dependent manner. negative-control antibodies 33G4 and human IgG-Fc did not neutralize virus entry. antibody binding assay with QH-HA pseudovirus-infected MDCK cells. 2-dimensional EM images of negatively stained HA-7Fab/H5HA complex were of high contrast. HA-7Fab binds laterally to the sides of the H5HA head. it does not contact receptor-binding site or potentially interact with receptor itself. glu119, Lys120, Ile121, and Gln122 constitute the entire core epitope map for HA-7. the two segments are 38 amino acid residues away from each other. the receptor (sialic acid [blue spheres]) is not. DISCUSSION H5N1 infection has become an increasing threat to public health worldwide (47\u201350) if the H5N1 virus acquires the ability to transmit from human to human, a potential influenza epidemic could emerge. a series of comprehensive prevention and immunotherapy strategies based on neutralizing MAbs specifically targeting the HA of H5N1 virus. reactivity with proteins covering residues 81 to 122 of HA1 is consistent with the results from the 3D-EM study of the HA-7Fab/H5HA complex. this new neutralizing epitope is highly conserved among clades 0 to 9 and their subclades of H5N1 viruses. the anti-HA antibodies function in two ways to neutralize influenza virus infection. HA-7 MAbs targeting the head region have the liability to induce strain-specific immunity against a particular subgroup of IAVs (26, 27). neutralizing antibody AVFluIgG01 recognized the sequence IIPKSSWS at residues 123 to 128 of HA1, with the key residues I123, I124, P125, W127, S128, Y168, and T171 (conversion to H5 numbering) virus HA at neutral and fusogenic pHs indicated that the HA head domain is required to undergo a conformational change. the binding of HA-7 to the head region may well prevent, or retard, this head domain change. HA-7 inhibits virus entry at the postattachment membrane fusion stage. ized as an effective passive immunotherapeutic agent for antiviral stockpiling for future influenza pandemics caused by emerging highly pathogenic avian H5N1 viruses. the identified epitope would also provide a significant foundation for the design of novel H5N1 vaccines covering this particular region."}
