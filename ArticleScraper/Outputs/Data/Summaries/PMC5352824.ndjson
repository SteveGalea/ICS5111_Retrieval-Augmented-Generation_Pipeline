{"summary": "the complexities of the Rond\u00f4nia malaria epidemic represent the norm for real-world disease systems, not the exception. disease ecologists should be prepared to address and study the importance of such drivers and their interactions in order to better understand the spread of infectious disease. a major limitation of this approach is that by focusing only on community members, it fails to link community risk to the broader political and social context within which the community lies. the field of social epidemiology has specifically studied the role of social systems in the health and spread of infectious disease in human populations [8,9]. social sciences have methods and tools for measuring social heterogeneity, a fundamental driver of the spread of infectious disease. infectious diseases are complex systems The components, agents and drivers involved in how infectious diseases spread through a population constitute a complex system, defined by coupled ecological, transmission and social dynamics. complex systems can be difficult to predict and control. component systems of infectious diseases all contain substantial nonlinearities. other systems also potentially contain nonlinearities in the form of competition, density- or frequency-dependent migration [16], social interaction [17] or economic growth. epidemics of sexually transmitted infections in communities with heterogeneous sexual contact behaviours have lower epidemic thresholds, lower endemic equilibria and higher critical vaccination thresholds. this insight into the importance of heterogeneity has been generalized to other disease systems, such as those for vector-borne pathogens. we highlight four areas of the social sciences that underscore the significance of the social system to disease emergence, propagation and dynamics. the integration of the social system with the transmission and ecological systems can bring about a deeper, more holistic understanding of disease dynamics. these four areas are: (a) social mixing and structure, (b) space and mobility, (c) geography and environmental impact, and (d) behaviour and behaviour change. Graph-theoretic models of disease contact networks take the idea of heterogeneous mixing to its logical extent. social network analysis has given us tools for studying heterogeneous contact degree distributions and targeted vaccination strategies of central individuals. some examples we will discuss here are modelling heterogeneous contact degree distributions, targeted vaccination strategies of central individuals and techniques for empirical data augmentation. the most at-risk and connected individuals in a population will be the first to exit the susceptible population either through death or acquired immunity. this non-random removal of high-risk individuals is known as 'network frailty' Embedded in the locations of individuals are patterns of spatial clustering that can facilitate or inhibit transmission. Navajos suffered fewer losses to smallpox than the nearby Hopi, who lived in more spatially dense communities. new methods for approximating density and movement of humans across space can be applied to monitoring risk of disease and informing effective strategies for targeting disease prevention initiatives. new methods for approximating density and movement of humans across space can be applied to monitoring risk of disease and informing effective strategies for targeting disease prevention initiatives. dilution-effect hypothesis attributes increased infection risk to decreases in biodiversity. evidence also supports the amplification effect, which points to tropical regions as the source of disproportionate number of infectious diseases due to their biodiversity. urbanization has also been cited as a key contributor to the rapid expansion of dengue virus across global tropical and subtropical regions over the past 40 years. urbanization has also been cited as a key contributor to the rapid expansion of dengue virus across global tropical and subtropical regions over the past 40 years. behaviours are subject to change when the health consequences of risky behaviour become greater than the benefits and reverse when the change in behaviour is believed to no longer be necessary. the age of first measles vaccination in the 1980s in the united states was negatively associated with measles prevalence [96]. social science methods have also been used to better understand behaviours that may drive super-spreader events of Nipah virus [99] social science methods have also been used to better understand behaviours that may drive super-spreader events of Nipah virus. response to outbreaks of Nipah virus routinely involve social scientists and anthropologists to help integrate biomedical models of infection transmission with local understanding. social network analysis has given us tools for studying heterogeneous contact degree distributions, targeted vaccination strategies of central individuals and techniques for empirical data augmentation. a random contact of an individual is more central to the network than the individual selected [44], a structural manifestation of individual heterogeneity in the propensity to form contacts. a non-random removal of high-risk individuals is known as 'network frailty' Detailed microsimulation models suggested contact network frailty due to the mature epidemic in the two Ugandan localities diluted the effectiveness of STI treatment. individuals may carry infectious diseases as they move across a landscape. a key barrier to better understanding the role of human mobility in disease ecology has been the lack of data that describe movement. new methods for approximating density and movement of humans across space can be applied to monitoring risk of disease. new methods for approximating density and movement of humans across space can be applied to monitoring risk of disease and informing effective strategies for targeting disease prevention initiatives. dilution-effect hypothesis attributes increased infection risk to decreases in biodiversity. evidence also supports the amplification effect, which points to tropical regions as the source of disproportionate number of infectious diseases due to their biodiversity. urbanization has also been cited as a key contributor to the rapid expansion of dengue virus across global tropical and subtropical regions over the past 40 years. influx of human populations into urban centres has brought people in increasing contact with Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. disease modellers typically neglect behavioural mechanisms in their models. behaviour change occurs when the health consequences of risky behaviour become greater than the benefits. demand for condoms in the u.s. was responsive to local prevalence of HIV/AIDS. age of first measles vaccination in the 1980s in the united states was negatively associated with measles prevalence. social science methods have also been used to better understand behaviours that may drive super-spreader events of Nipah virus. social science methods have also been used to better understand behaviours that may drive super-spreader events of Nipah virus [99] and the cultural and logistical constraints around changing patient\u2013caregiver interactions to prevent person-to-person spread. the subjects we review provide examples where social questions can be and have been incorporated into transmission-dynamics models. the overarching themes of this paper and many of the topics we discuss are exemplified in our original case example of malaria in Rond\u00f4nia. grant no.
