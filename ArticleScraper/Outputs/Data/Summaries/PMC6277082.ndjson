{"summary": "amiRNAs are small RNA molecules that are expressed under the backbone of endogenous cellular miRNAs. amiRNAs bind to the targeted mRNA in a sequence-specific manner leading to direct mRNA degradation or translational inhibition. amiRNA-expressing vectors provide unique benefits in designing antiviral therapy. the genome is a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA of 11 kb. the genome consists of a single open reading frame flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 noncoding regions. the 3\u2032UTR region plays a critical role in the viral replication in the host cells. amiRNA design and plasmid construction amiRNA sequences were designed using Block-iT RNAi Web Designer tool. amiRNAs were cloned into pcDNATM6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector (Invitrogen, Inc.), according to the manufacturer's protocol. amiRNA sequences were analyzed using NCBI Blastn against human and mouse transcript sequences. amiRNA was cloned into pcDNATM6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector. Schematic representations of the JEV 3\u2032UTR structure. cells were plated on 6-well plates at a density of 1.5 105 cells per well. the cells were infected with JEV [multiplicity of infection (MOI of 5] as mentioned above. one microgram amiRNA of each clone was transfected into cells after 3 h of JEV infection. cells were rinsed twice with 1 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove the excess virus. the plate was allowed to keep for 15 min at room temperature until the agarose overlay solidified. cells were stained for 15 min at 37\u00b0C by adding 1.5% crystal violet solution. cells were washed thrice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. cells were permeabilized in 0.25% Triton X-100 for 10 min at RT. dilution of 1:1,000 was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. lysates were centrifuged at 12,000 g for 20 min. total cell extracts were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel. electrophoresis was transferred to nitrocellulose membranes, then probed with an antibody (NS1, 1:5,000; GENTEX), followed by goat anti-rabbit IgG-HRP-conjugated antibody. results were graphed with error bars indicating the standard deviation. amiRNAs were cloned into pcDNATM6.2-GW/EmGFP-miR vector. the amiRNA expressed was based on the natural structure of Mus musculus miR-155. amiRNAs were analyzed using NCBI Blastn against human and mouse transcript sequences. a microgram amiRNA of each clone was transfected into cells after 3 h of JEV infection using Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen) one microgram amiRNA of each clone was transfected into cells after 3 h of JEV infection. cells were allowed to grow up to 48 h. cell Titer 96 Aqueous one solution reagent (20 L; CellTiter 96\u00ae Non-Radioactive Cell Proliferation Assay; Promega, WI) was added to each well 4 h before the duration of 48 hpi. absorbance measured at 570 nm using a 96-well multimode plate reader (Synergy 2Multi-Mode Reader; BioteK) hek293T cells were cotransfected with 100 ng of psiCHECK2 constructs and 1,000 ng of amiRNA plasmid and control plasmid. after 24 h, cells were first infected with JEV (MOI = 5), and after 3 hpi, cells were transfected with amiRNAs. quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction N2a cells were plated in a 6-well plate at a density of 1.5 105 cells per well. after 24 h, cells were infected with virus followed by transfection. cells were plated in a 6-well plate at a density of 1.5 105 cells per well. after 24 h, cells were infected with virus followed by transfection. the positive recombinant plasmids were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. the positive recombinant plasmids were confirmed by nucleotide sequencing. we performed the MTT assay (Promega) to evaluate the percentage of metabolically active cells after different transfecting concentrations of amiRNAs in N2a cells. eGFP analysis of four ISG (Ifitm1, Oasl1, and Isg15) mRNA expression was used to normalize the ISG expression. amiRNAs efficiently bind JEV 3\u2032UTR and inhibit viral replication. amiRNAs exert their inhibitory function by binding the target sequence. transfection of amiRNA #1 and amiRNA #2 significantly reduced luciferase expressions. transfection of 50 ng amiRNA clone reduces luciferase level up to 40%. luciferase level decreased in a dose-dependent manner. data are shown as the firefly luciferase activity relative to the Renilla luciferase activity. results represent binding effect of 1,000 ng of amiRNA construct on luciferase construct. asterisk indicates statistical significance at 48 hpi. amiRNA #5-treated cells were 3.4 106, 1.2 106, and 2.8 107 pfu/mL, respectively, at 48 hpi, compared to 6.4 107 pfu/mL in virus amiRNA-lacZ. we also performed indirect immunofluorescence assay using amiRNA. representative images of amiRNA-treated N2a cells showed staining of JEV NS1 protein. red fluorescence indicates the virus load as assessed with anti-JEV NS1 mAb and a secondary antibody conjugated with Alexa-594. blue fluorescence represents amiRNA expression into the cells. 50\u20131,000 ng of plasmid vector harboring amiRNAs was transfected into N2a cells in each well of 96-well plates. after transfection (24 h), fluorescence-positive cells were found. green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression increased in a dose-dependent manner. amiRNAs can exhibit substantial antiviral effect by inducing interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) no change in expression level was evident in amiRNA #2-transfected cells. amiRNAs efficiently bind JEV 3\u2032UTR and inhibit viral replication. luciferase level decreased in a dose-dependent manner. but we did not observe any significant changes in the luciferase level with amiRNA #5. amiRNA #5 miRNA may not be able to express in our experimental condition. amiRNAs were transfecting 1 g of each plasmid into mouse neuroblastoma cells after 3 hpi with JEV. we lysed the cells at 48 hpi for western blot analysis, and culture supernatant was used for plaque reduction analysis. transfection of other amiRNAs significantly reduced virus release in the culture supernatant (>95%) amiRNA #2-transfected cells showed enhanced viral replication. antiviral efficacy of each amiRNA was assessed in neuronal cells. qRT-PCR was performed with specific primers for JEV region. this is the first report to successfully apply vector-delivered amiRNA targeted against the consensus sequence of JEV 3\u2032UTR in inhibition of JEV replication in neuronal cells. however, the efficacy of these amiRNAs remains to be tested in vivo. amiRNA #2 seed sequences are highly conserved against all the virulent strains of different genotypes. the amiRNA #2 seed sequences are highly conserved against all the virulent strains of different genotypes. amiRNA #1 suppressed viral replication compared to control. these findings offer a proof of concept for the development of novel amiRNA-based therapeutics against emerging JEV."}
