{"summary": "community quarantine is one of the oldest tools to control communicable disease epidemics. most affected countries \u2013 liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea \u2013 resorted to community quarantine as the mainstay means to control the spread of Ebola. such measures were opposed by some communities who reacted hostilely [5\u20137], which in turn prompted local authorities to resort to violence. public health authorities should use least restrictive measures proportional to the goal of achieving disease control. others object that it is unfair to justify the use of community quarantine solely on the basis of public health interests. they argue that individual persons should be valued as ends in themselves and should never be used as a means for public health ends. limited studies about public attitudes towards quarantine have been conducted exclusively in high-income countries. public support for the use of quarantine contrasts with attitudes of non-compliance observed in west africa. purpose of the present study was not to study participants' views of the quarantine measures implemented in Guinea during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola epidemic. the vignette technique has been used in several studies on ethically challenging issues in africa. the technique makes it possible to assess how cues are weighted, how they are combined and how different groups of participants differ in weighting and combining. one condition for examining the processes of weighting and combining is that each participant has the same information presented in same way. on 1 august 2014, local authorities established a quarantine zone of 20 000 km2, erecting a barrier to isolate the major Ebola epicentre. individual quarantine measures were applied to over 54 500 people across the country who had been potentially exposed to Ebola cases. many of those people lost their livelihoods, lacked basic commodities, but did not receive the support services promised by the government [34] participants were given a choice of test site: either right away in a quiet classroom in a local school, at a 3 min walk, or later at their private homes. participants were given a standardised definition of community quarantine, and was to indicate, in each case, the degree of acceptability of such a measure. the participants took 30\u201345 min to complete the ratings. ethics approval for the study was obtained from the Guinean National Review Board for Health Research, the Guinean National Review Board for Research on Ebola and the Institutional Review Board of the University of Teluq. researchers presented participants with vignettes depicting the implementation of quarantine measure in a community affected by a communicable disease epidemic. the vignettes were composed of combinations of different levels of four factors influencing perceptions of quarantine. the vignette technique has already been used in several studies on ethically challenging issues in Africa. on 1 august 2014, local authorities established a quarantine zone of 20 000 km2 erecting a barrier to isolate the major Ebola epicentre. many of those people lost their livelihood, lacked basic commodities, but did not receive the support services \u2013 food and water \u2013 promised by the government [34]. dozens of hostile reactions to quarantine measures were reported, including vandalism and death threats. three hundred and fifty people were selected and received full explanations regarding the study and the procedure. those who agreed to participate provided written informed consent. they received no incentive. participants were tested individually, according to the procedure recommended by Anderson. they made ratings themselves, at their own pace. participants took 30\u201345 min to complete the ratings. the significance threshold was set at 0.001. results Of the 350 people contacted, 302 agreed to participate. forty per cent self-identified as Muslim, 39% as Christian, 16% as Animists. figures with the same subscript in each column are significantly different, P 0.05. for example, in the second column, asignificantly higher number of women in the Never Acceptable cluster than of men. the judged acceptability of quarantine is on the y-axis; the three levels of the disease\u2019s level of lethality and the two levels of contagiousness are on x-axis. the first cluster (N = 55, 18% of the sample) was called Never Acceptable because the mean rating was 0.30; that is, extremely close to zero. females (24%), younger people (21% of ages 18\u201320 and 27% of ages 21\u201330), Muslims (26%), ratings were higher when the level of contagiousness was high (M = 7.35) than when it was moderate (M = 2.44), F(1,38) = 1666.73, P 0.001, 2p = 0.98, and when the level of lethality was very high (M = 6.83) than when it was high (M = 4.93) or low (M = 2.93), F(2,76) = 281.91, 2p = 0.88. the impact of the number of cases of infection was weak; mean ratings ranged from 4.61 (five cases) to 4.95 (100 cases) participants older than 31 years (51%), Christians (53%) and participants with a college degree (56%) were significantly more likely to be members of this cluster than other participants. the study examined the views of lay people in Guinea on the acceptability of community quarantine and found different positions. for 18% of the participants, quarantine measures are never acceptable, even when the disease is highly lethal and contagious, its incidence is high and support services are provided. health authorities must demonstrate that infected persons are really contagious. consequences of the disease may be severe, and those in quarantine will be provided with support services. importance of first criterion demonstrated in 2014\u20132016 Ebola epidemic. a group that opposed quarantine under all conditions was also found in south Korea in the context of the spread to south Korea in 2015 of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome. the opposition of some people in Guinea to quarantine during the 2014\u20132016 Ebola epidemic can be explained by more general doubts about the effectiveness of and optimal use of social distancing measures. this study found an effect of socio-demographic variables on the perception of quarantine. it is not certain that beliefs and social attributes associated with socio-demographic variables underlay respondents' positions. this issue should be explored through in-depth individual interviews. the diversity of positions suggests that no one single strategy to promote voluntary compliance will be appropriate when resorting to quarantine as a means to control communicable disease."}
