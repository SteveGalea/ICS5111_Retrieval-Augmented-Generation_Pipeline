{"summary": "prospective study included 320 patients with fever. 23.4% were viral-positive by mPCR, with influenza virus most prominent followed by picornavirus. a systematic clinical, radiological and biological analysis of these patients can contribute to effective therapy that may prevent the development of CAP and improve the outcomes. the present work showed an elaborate analysis evidence of viral infection among fever CAP inpatients. nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples were collected from enrolled CAP patients after admission to the hospital. mPCR kits were used to detect viruses in both nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples. the resultant DNA/RNA was eluted with 60 L elution buffer and stored at 80 \u00b0C until testing. ten kinds of viral DNA/RNA were detected using the one step primeScript RT-PCR kit (Perfect Real-time, DRR064; Takara) a prospective study was conducted through our enrolment system. a new infiltrate on the chest radiograph of these fever patients was diagnosed as CAP. nasopharyngeal swab and sputum samples were collected from enrolled CAP patients. samples of nasopharyngeal swab and sputum were collected for mPCR within 72 hours. the resultant DNA/RNA was eluted with 60 L elution buffer and stored at 80 \u00b0C until testing. statistical analysis Clinical data, including demographic variables, including age, gender, clinical symptoms, underlying diseases and complications, severity score assessed by CURB65. logistic regression analysis was also used to examine the risk factors associated with influenza A viral infection. there were 71 (22.2%) and 28 (8.8%) patients with respiratory failure and ARDS. the virus-positive group had a larger population for these two complications than the virus-negative group. viral-positive patients had higher serum lactic dehydrogenase and creatine kinase (CK) compared with virus-negative patients. 2 (8.7) 7 (22.6) 27 (12.6) 0.07 Interstitial lung disease 35 (10.9) 2 (3.8) 4 (17.4) 3 (9.7) 26 (12.1) 0.22 Heart disease 30 (9.4) 3 (5.8) 5 (21.7) 4 (12.9) 18 (8.4) 0.13 Immunodeficiency 27 (8.4) 5 (9.6) 3 (13.0) 2 (6.5) 17 (7.9) 31 (14.5) 0.7 Antibiotics treatment outside 168 (52.5) 30 (57. 0.04 (0.02\u20130.1) 0.04* ESR, mm/h 34 (14.0\u201359.0) 32 (15.5\u201353.5) 33 (10.0\u201365.0) 61.5 (30.3\u201377.3) 33.5 (13.3\u201356.0) 0.06 CRP, mg/L 19.2 (2.0\u201375.0) 11.9 (3.0\u201345.3) 10.3 (2.0\u201372.0) 42 (9.1\u201393.9) 8.7 (1.9\u201357.8) 0.02* WBC 4109/ 5 (21.7) 7 (22.6) 24 (11.2) 0.004* ICU 9 (2.8) 3 (5.8) 1 (4.3) 2 (6.5) 3 (1.4) 0.15 Invasive mechanical ventilation 9 (2.8) 1 (1.9) 3 (13.0) 4 (12.9) 1 (0.5) 0.001* Length of stay, d 9 (7.0\u201313.0) 11 (8.0\u201314.0) 8 (6.5\u201313.5) 10.5 (7.0\u201313.5) 8 (7.0\u2013 male sex 207 (64.7) 49 (65.3) 158 (64.5) 1 Smoking history 120 (37.5) 24 (32.0) 96 (39.2) 0.28 Underlying disease COPD 52 (16.3) 12 (16.0) 40 (16.3) 1 Asthma 15 (4.7) 2 (2.7) 13 (5.3) 0.53 Bronchiectasis 68 (21.3) 14 (18.7) 54 (22.0) 0.63 Diabetes mellitus 38 (11.9) 4 (5.3) 34 (1 ESR, mm/h 34 (14.0\u201359.0) 35.5 (14.0\u201360.0) 0.47 CRP, mg/L 19.2 (2.5\u201375.2) 11.6 (2.6\u201353.3) 11 (1.9\u201372.5) 0.64 WBC 4109/L 21 (6.6) 11 (14.7) 10 (4.1) 0.003* IL-6, pg/mL 20.1 (7.95\u201352.0) 18.7 (9.2\u201362.4) 20.2 (7.6\u20135 the most common virus detected in CAP patients with fever was influenza A, followed by picornavirus. the viral-group and mixed group were more likely to have a higher fever (T >39 \u00b0C) than the no pathogen group. nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were analyzed by multiplex real-time PCR. nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were detected by multiplex real-time PCR. CK >294 IU/L, WBC 4109/L, emergency admission, and respiratory failure were independent factors associated with influenza infection in multivariate logistic regression analysis. in this study, we also analysed two risk factors for outcomes of CAP patients with fever.

CAP, community-acquired pneumonia; Ref, reference; OR, odds ratio; 95% CI, 95% confidence interval. nasopharyngeal swabs and sputum samples were collected for mPCR. only 230 patients had sputum samples, suggesting there is a lower viral load in nasopharyngeal samples from CAP patients. sensitivity of viral pathogen identification could be enhanced by simultaneous examination both NPS and sputum samples. the co-infection group had the highest death rate (21.6%) compared with the other three groups. the mixed group was also identified as an independent risk factor for complicated courses (death and invasive mechanical ventilation) in ICU samples. ARDS and respiratory failure are associated with viral infection. there are no definite predictors for causative virus in CAP."}
