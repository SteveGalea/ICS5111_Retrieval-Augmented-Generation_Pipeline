{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a human coronavirus that emerged in the middle east in 2012. since then, 2100 confirmed cases and 730 deaths have been reported. currently, MERS-CoV remains a public health threat. exacerbated NF-B activity has been demonstrated to be important for the inflammatory immunopathology induced by respiratory viruses such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV [5, 6] and influenza A virus [7]. karyopherin-4 (importin-3), which is responsible for the nuclear import of NF-B, is a 4b binding protein. dual deletion of genes 4a and 4b led to a significant increase in expression levels of IL-6, IL-8, and TNF- compared to the wild-type infection. one or both proteins repressed NF-B activation during MERS-CoV infection. individual deletion mutants MERS-CoV-4a and MERS-CoV-4b were engineered. the replication kinetics of these singly mutated viruses in Huh-7 cells was not significantly different from that of the wild-type virus. proteins 4a and 4b were not required for virus replication in cell culture. expression levels of 4a and 4b proteins (A in S2 Fig) were similar to those of the wild-type virus. the size of both deleted and remaining regions in 4a and 4b genes is indicated by arrows. the patterned boxes in 4a and 4b mutants indicate frameshift mutations in 4a and 4b sequence caused by the deletions. MERS-CoV mutants defective in 4b nuclear localization were engineered. mutations in 4b protein (NLS-S1 and NLS-S2) are indicated by the shadowed area and the arrows. the light blue boxes in DUP, DUP-mNLS-S1 and DUP-mNLS-S2 mutants indicate duplicated 4a sequences. 4b protein (green) and dsRNA (red) were detected with specific antibodies and nuclei (blue) were stained with DAPI. no significant differences in expression levels of 4a and 4b proteins in Huh-7 cells were observed by Western-blot analysis. the cytoplasmic distribution of 4a protein observed in MERS-CoV-wild-type-infected cells was not affected in the NLS mutants. mutation of 4b NLS-S1 in MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1 prevented the nuclear import of 4b, which was restricted to the cytoplasm. 4a-4b sequences are required for the repression of NF-B-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines during infection. mutants were infected with 4b-NLS mutants at a MOI of 1 PFU/cell. NF-B-dependent cytokine response during infection did not affect replication. mRNA expression levels of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF- were quantified by RT-qPCR in Huh-7 cells mock-treated or treated with parthenolide (12 M) the mRNA expression levels of IL6, IL8, TNF- and IFNB1 were quantified by RT-qPCR in. cells mock-treated or treated with the NF-B inhibitor parthenolide. no difference in IFN- levels was observed in Huh-7 cells. 4b NLS mutants did not induce IFN- production in Calu-3 cells. this suggests a limited contribution of 4b protein to the suppression of the IFN- response. activated NF-B has been reported to rapidly induce expression of IB to restore NF-B inhibition. we further treated infected cells with TNF- for different time periods. at this time point, significant levels of 4b had accumulated (B in S4 Fig) the interactions were confirmed by reciprocal co-immunoprecipitation experiments followed by Western blotting. Specifically, pull-down of 4b-FLAG from Huh-7 cells with a FLAG antibody isolated endogenous karyopherin-4 and karyopherin-3, but not the control protein actin. cell lysates (CL) and eluted proteins were immunoprecipitated. cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP or KPNA4-FLAG (K4-FL) 48 hours later cells were infected with MERS-CoV at an MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. coV 4b protein includes a bipartite NLS and localizes to the nucleus. the basic amino acids in NLS-S1 or NLS-S2 were replaced with alanine in plasmids. cell lysates were analyzed by co-immunoprecipitation with FLAG antibodies followed by Western-blot. NF-B analyzed the ability of 4b protein to interact with -karyopherins. kPNA1 (importin-3 subfamily), KPNA2 (importin-1 subfamily) and KPNA3 and KPNA4 (importin-2 subfamily). Huh-7 cells were co-transfected with plasmids expressing 4b-HA and empty vector (EV) or control-3XFLAG (C-) or KPNA-FLAG proteins KPNA1-FLAG (K1), KPNA2-FLAG (K2), KPNA3-FLAG (K3), or KPNA4-FLAG (K4) cell protein RuvBL1 has been used as a control for non-specific binding to the FLAG-antibody coated beads in the absence of karyopherin protein. the relative binding of 4b to each karyopherin during infection was determined as described in (B) in infections either with MERS-CoV-4b or MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1, p65 was detected both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm. the dual distribution of 4b protein between the nucleus and the cytoplasm was associated with the presence of p65 in both cellular compartments. p65 [18] and 4b (Fig 4D) proteins compete for binding to the same site in KPNA4. co-IP experiments with FLAG antibodies in Huh-7 cells transfected with a plasmid encoding karyopherin 4 (KPNA4)-FLAG. results confirm binding of KPNA4 to 4b protein was also NLS-dependent in the context of infection. deletion mutants 3, 4ab, 5) interfere with the innate immune response during infection. Viruses deleted in the accessory proteins, like the parental virus, were unable to induce IFN (S1 Fig) in contrast to the effective induction of IFN- by poly(I:C) transfection. 4a gene was almost entirely deleted excluding the 4a/4b overlapping sequences and the 3\u2019 most 53 nt, in order to maintain the TRS for transcription of gene 5. recombinant viruses were sequenced in Huh-7 cells with titers similar to those of wild-type virus. genes 4a and 4b were deleted from the MERS-CoV infectious cDNA clone by PCR-directed mutagenesis. the size of both deleted and remaining regions in 4a and 4b genes is indicated by arrows. the expression of mRNAs coding for NF-B-dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines was analyzed in Huh-7 cells infected with the deletion mutants 4a and 4b. deletion of 4a did not have any effect on the expression of IL-6, IL-8 and TNF- as compared to the wild-type virus. deletion of 4b significantly increased their expression to similar or even higher levels than those observed in MERS-CoV-4ab. the 189 nt-sequence duplicated in 4b-NLS mutants is indicated by the shadowed area and the arrows. the light blue boxes in DUP, DUP-mNLS-S1 and DUP-mNLS-S2 mutants indicate duplicated 4a sequences. 4b protein (green) and dsRNA (red) were detected with specific antibodies. genesis required the separation of 4a and 4b genes by duplicating the common region. two mutant cDNAs were engineered either containing alanine mutations of NLS-S1 (RKRAAA, MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S1) or both the intermediate Lys residues and NLS-S2 (KKAA and KRRAAA, MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S2). mutation of NLS-S2 in MERS-CoV-DUP-mNLS-S2 only partially prevented the nuclear import of 4b, with protein detected in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm. the results demonstrated that in the context of infection, 4b NLS-S1 was essential for nuclear localization. nuclear translocation of 4b was required to inhibit expression of NF-B dependent pro-inflammatory cytokines in Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells. NF-B-dependent response during infection with MERS-CoV-4b-NLS mutants (MOI = 1 PFU/cell, 24 hpi) cell supernatant was replaced by fresh medium containing TNF- (50 ng/ml) after 30 min treatment, cell lysates were prepared for immunoblotting with anti IB antibody. actin was used as a loading control. levels of IB were analyzed by Western-blot in cells infected with 4b-mutant MERS-CoVs. it was difficult to detect IB degradation in the context of viral infection. activation of NF-B requires the degradation of the inhibitor IB. the 4b protein did not inhibit the degradation of IB. inhibition of the NF-B response by the 4b protein did not occur at steps prior to the nuclear translocation of NF-B. peptides were immunoprecipitated with overexpressed 4b-FLAG protein. 4a protein interacts with importin-2 family karyopherins when expressed in isolation. Huh-7 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP or KPNA4-FLAG. 48 hours later cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG monoclonal antibody. GFP has been used as a control for 4b non-non-specific binding to the FLAG-antibody coated beads in the absence of karyopherin protein. the nuclear translocation of most cellular proteins is mediated by -karyopherins (or importin-s), which directly bind the NLS within cargo proteins, and karyopherin- (or importin-) importin-3 subfamily, consisting of KPNA1, KPNA5, and KPNA6, is best known for binding phosphorylated STATs. 4b protein only pulled down importin-2 subfamily members (S5 Fig), which are known to bind NF-B. cells were collected at 20 hpi and cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody. lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and analyzed with anti-4b and anti-FLAG antibodies. MERS-CoV 4b protein preferentially bound to KPNA4 over all other karyopherins. cells were transfected with plasmids expressing GFP-3XFLAG (C-) or KPNA-FLAG proteins KPNA1-FL (K1), KPNA2-FL (K2), KPNA3-FL (K3), or KPNA4-FL (K4) 48 hours later, cells were infected with WT MERS-CoV at a MOI of 0.1 PFU/cell. p65 subunit at 24 hpi in Huh-7 and Calu-3 cells infected with wild-type MERS-CoV or recombinant viruses expressing cytoplasmic 4b-NLS mutant proteins. p65 protein localized to the nucleus while most of the p65 protein was detected in the cytoplasm. at 18 hpi, cells were fractionated into cytoplasmic (C) and nuclear (N) fractions. at 24 hpi, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies against 4b (green) and p65 (red) plasmid encoding karyopherin 4 (KPNA4)-FLAG was infected at 24 hpt. cells lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibodies. all studies involving MERS-CoV proteins have been done with viral proteins expressed in isolation. accessory proteins are not required for viral replication in cell culture. the 4b protein is specific for MERS-CoV and does not show significant homology to other coV accessory proteins. no significant homology to other viral or mammalian proteins was found. 4b binding to KPNA4 inhibited its interaction with NF-B-p65 subunit. thereby we propose a model where 4b outcompetes NF-B for KPNA4 binding and translocation into the nucleus. other functions of 4b or additional MERS-CoV proteins might also contribute to the NF-B antagonism. nuclear localization of 4b is exceptional among the other known viral PDEs. but in the context of MHV infection, minor expression levels of MERS-CoV 4b in the cytoplasm are sufficient to prevent RNase L activation. the relevance of 4b PDE activity to promote MERS-CoV replication requires further confirmation. coV nsp1 and SARS-CoV ORF 3b proteins are sufficiently small to diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complex [30, 32] nsp1 and SARS-CoV ORF 3b proteins are sufficiently small to diffuse passively through the nuclear pore complex. interference with the nuclear import machinery is a common viral strategy to evade the innate immune response. enterovirus 71 (EV71) infection suppresses IFN responses by inhibiting STAT1/2 nuclear transport through the induction of caspase-3-dependent degradation of KPNA1. the association of viral proteins with the host nuclear import pathway confirms its relevance in virus-host interactions, regulating innate immunity and cellular responses to infection. regulation of NF-B signaling during HCoV-229E infection has been described, consisting in the simultaneous induction of the NF-B pathway. restriction of the NF-B response to limit transcription of pro-inflammatory and other potentially antiviral host cell genes. inhibition of nuclear import by SARS-CoV ORF6 has been shown to mediate pleiotropic alterations in host gene expression during infection [51] that enhance viral pathogenesis in vivo. adapted viral clones with large deletions in ORF4b, in addition to other missense mutations throughout the genome, caused increased lung inflammation and mouse weight losses. none of these studies used congenic strains of virus solely differing in 4b expression. infected cells were overlaid with DMEM containing 0.6% low-melting agarose and 2% FBS. at 72 hpi, cells were fixed with 10% formaldehyde and stained with 0.1% crystal violet. all work with MERS-CoV infectious viruses was performed in biosafety level 3 facilities. the plasmid pBAC-MERSFL was used as the template for amplification of overlapping PCR fragments with oligonucleotides. the final PCR product was amplified with external oligonucleotides SA25412-VS (5\u2019-CTGCACTGGTTGTGGCAC-3\u2019) and MERS-26970-Nhe RS (5\u2019-GCTAAAGCAGCTACATAGCCGCTCTCCTCTCGC -3\u2019) pBAC-MERSFL-4a included a deletion from nucleotides 25,874 to 25,991 of the MERS-CoV genome. the deletion in pBAC-MERSFL-4b extended from nucleotides 26,183 to 26,781. sequences were checked after cloning by sequencing. -mNLS-S2 included alanine mutations in 4b NLS-S2 (aa 36\u201338) and two intermediate Lys residues (aa 30\u201331) the genetic integrity of the cDNAs was verified by restriction analysis and sequencing.
