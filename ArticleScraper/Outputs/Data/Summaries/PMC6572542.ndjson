known to the laboratory workers who handle the virus. a 19th century English medical journal described an incident in England, where a worker clearing a 30-year-old grave was infected with smallpox [3,39,40]. a question that comes into our mind is whether the hardness of the shell (and not only its complex multi-layer structure) supports this observation. the mystery of the Elusive HIV Vaccine The search for an effective human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) vaccine has spanned over 30 years with hundreds of billions of dollars spent with no success. a closer look at all available data reveals that such an explanation is limited as there are several counterexamples. this paper describes the concept of viral shell disorder or shapeshifting that was first introduced by us in a 2008 study that reported a strange characteristic not previously noticed in the outer shell and matrix of the HIV-1. the percentage of intrinsic disorder (PID) in HIV-1 matrix protein can be as high as 70%, the levels, which are very rare in the outer shells of other viruses [11,12]. the aforementioned peculiarity of HIV was discovered using one of such disorder predictors, PONDR\u00ae-VLXT [11]. it uses a neural network that takes a protein sequence as input and provides disorder or order score for each residue as output. this predictor has been shown to be a reliable tool in providing insights into a long list of medically important viruses. the rabies virus has only two layers (Figure 1b) smallpox can survive in the environment for a long time. it is not surprising that smallpox can survive in the environment for long time. pes simplex virus (HSV) contains as many as 84 proteins, with its tegument (matrix, outer shell) containing as many as 20 different proteins. a set of viruses was carefully selected as seen in Table 1. they were chosen as representatives of viruses for which effective vaccines are available or not. rix, p15 (P69732) Capsid, p26 (P69732) Nucleocapsid, p11

pathogenic virus spread by mosquitoes. an effective vaccine was first discovered by Max Theiler in 1937. the outer shell (matrix) of HIV-1 is characterized by a remarkably high level of intrinsic disorder (PID) in the shell proteins of various viruses. the HIV-1 matrix means PID of 56.5 10.8 is the highest among all outer shell proteins. the HCV core PIDs 52.5 0.5 and 48.5 0.5 refer to core proteins p19 and p20 respectively as described in Table 1. corresponding HSV protein with the highest PID is one of the major tegument proteins in this complex virus. the pattern of shell PIDs of viruses in general is completely different from that of HIV. tegument proteins with the highest and lowest PIDs are shown. in (b,c), each PID represents maximum PID found for the specific protein. the mean PID alone can be misleading for the readers. the EIAV cannot \u201cafford\u201d a soft disordered matrix that would help this virus to evade the host immune system, as seen for the sexually transmitted HIV. a JAVA program was written to generate codes that could be read by Jmol. the rabies virus has matrix and nucleocapsid PIDs below 30% [11], which are considered low. this hardness of the shell can explain the fact that the rabies vaccine is one of the first to be discovered during the dawn of modern microbiology. the rabies vaccine is one of the first to be discovered during the dawn of modern microbiology. influenza vaccine can reduce the chances of serious illness by 40\u201360%. the matrix PID mean (35.2 1.6) for influenza virus as seen in Table 1 looks nothing like those of HIV, HSV or HCV. problems in the development of a successful HIV vaccine are fundamentally different from those of influenza. the differences in disorder levels can be explained in terms of viral evolution and modes of transmission. the EIAV cannot \u201cafford\u201d a soft disordered matrix that would help this virus to evade the host immune system. the rabies virus has matrix and

those of influenza. the YFV shell disorder pattern is telling us something not seen in the rest of the viruses. the virulence arises from the ability of the virus to multiply rapidly especially in vital organs. by being disordered and thus promiscuous, the viral protein is able to bind to a greater variety of proteins that it would not normally bind to [11,12,25,26,30,42,53,54] HSV, HCV and HIV: Similarities and Differences in transmission evolution and genetics. these differences are also reflected in the shell disorder of the respective viruses. differences in matrix disorder can be found among the different strains of HIV-1 and in HIV-1 and HIV-2. if the virus has a more disordered outer shell, it then has the luxury of more disordered inner shell proteins. this may explain why HIV-1\u2019s innermost shell proteins drop dramatically in PID. if the virus has a harder outer shell, it then has the luxury of more disordered inner shell proteins. HCV is not easily transmitted by sexual intercourse but is seen as transmitted mainly by blood contamination especially via illicit drugs use. a better explanation for the lower outer shell PID in HCV (52.5 0.5, 48.5 0.5), in contrast to HIV (56.5 10.8), has to do with the fact that HCV is a hepatitis virus that is likely to be in contact at various times with bile. virus with both HSV-1 and HSV-2 genes have been found worldwide. this is to be expected as it has been previously observed that in other viruses such as HIV, closely related viruses exchange genes regularly especially in cases when two viruses infect a host simultaneously. HSV, HCV and HIV: Similarities and Differences in transmission evolution and genetics. differences in matrix disorder can be found among the different strains of HIV-1 and in HIV-1 and HIV-2. if the virus has a harder outer shell, it then has the luxury of more disordered inner shell proteins. this may explain why the virus\u2019s innermost shell proteins drop dramatically in PID (9.5 3.0%) especially when compared to HIV-2 (46.5 0.1%). HCV is a hepatitis virus that is likely to be in contact at various times with bile, which is produced by the liver. bile digests lipids and is known to be capable of damaging microbes such as bacteria. a virus with both HSV-1 and HSV-2 genes has been found worldwide. this is to be expected as it has been previously observed that in other viruses such as HIV, closely related viruses exchange genes regularly especially in cases when two viruses infect a host simultaneously. the proteins mentioned are major tegument proteins. the proteins are abundantly found in the tegument [42,53]. the lack of effective vaccines and the presence of a relatively disordered outer shell represent the common traits defining virulence. experimental evidence is also accumulated to show that the rate of evolution of viruses is correlated with their modes of transmission. the model was so accurate that it was able to predict that MERS-CoV has a strong fecal-oral transmission component and therefore would not spread as easily as its cousin. a corollary to this knowledge is that the more flexible the linkers are, the likelier it is the immune response will be poor. a corollary to this knowledge is that the more flexible the linkers are, the likelier it is the immune response will be poor. the true viral shapeshifter has a highly disordered outer shell, that is engaged in constant motions. the true viral shapeshifter has a highly disordered outer shell, that is engaged in constant motions. the true viral shapeshifter has a highly disordered outer shell. the lack of neutralizing antibodies themselves presented a huge mystery that had been nagging the biomedical community until now. researchers involved in the HIV vaccine development need to go through the viral shapeshifting concepts presented here to determine feasibility. the oncolytic herpes virus, T-Vec, has been approved by the fda. a major obstacle for both phage and oncolytic virotherapies is the accurate delivery of the viruses to the target. this is where the concept of viral shapeshifting will come in handy. obtain antibodies against the host-targeting proteins have been observed for several pathogens not counting the viral examples discussed herein. the evolution and utilization of disorder-to-order transitions may be a strategy commonly used by pathogens to avoid immunological neutralization."}
