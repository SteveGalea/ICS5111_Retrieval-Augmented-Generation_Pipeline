{"summary": "NETs are mesh-like structures that contain DNA as a backbone. NETs trap microbes and form an anti-microbial-protein-rich microenvironment. pentraxin 3 (PTX3) was reported as one of the NET component proteins. NETs are mesh-like structures that consist of cellular DNA. these proteins reside in neutrophil granules and the nucleus. the release of NETs has also been reportedly observed without cell death. NETs are formed upon activation of neutrophils by factors such as IL-8, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), bacteria, fungi, and activated platelets. the release of NETs has also been reportedly observed without cell death. PTX3 Genome Breviario et al. identified PTX3 as one of the IL-1 -induced genes in human umbilical vein endothelial cells. PTX3 belongs to the pentraxin family, which included acute phase proteins C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid P-component. the mature PTX3 consists of two domains, i.e., the N-terminal domain (18\u2013178 a.a.) and the C-terminal domain (179\u2013381 a.a.). the PTX3 protein forms an octamer via the inter-molecule disulfide bonds. expression pattern PTX3 mRNA expression is induced by primary inflammatory signals in certain cells, such as myeloid dendritic cells (Doni et al., 2003) PTX3 expression pattern is observed in neutrophils. PTX3 is abundantly present in granules, but PTX3 mRNA expression is not detected. PTX3 is produced during the course of neutrophil maturation. PTX3 localizes to specific granules. circulating PTX3 level is as low as approximately 2 ng/mL. PTX3 levels are significantly increased in certain infectious, cardiovascular, kidney, and female reproductive system diseases. increases can reach up to 10100 times the control level in severe inflammatory and infectious diseases such as sepsis. p = 0.01 Bacteremia Non-survivor: 44.8 (10.7, 69.4) Huttunen et al., 2011 Survivor: 6.4 (3.4, 13.5)d p 0.001 Cardiovascular diseases Unstable angina pectoris (UAP) UAP: 6.09 (4.34\u20137.85) Inoue et al., 2007 Control: 2.30 (2.03\u20132.55)e p = 0.00003 Chronic heart failure (CHF) 0.015 (0, 0.06)f p 0.0001 Hypertension Anti-hypertensive mediation Parlak et al., 2012 Pre-treatment: 35.25 5.45 Post-treatment: 0.14 0.19b p 0.0001 Acute ischemic strokes Non-survivor: 18.0 (8.2, 26.1) Ryu et al., 2012 Survivor: 6.4 (3.4, 11.8)d p 0.001 Giant cell arteritis (GCA Nishi et al., 2011 Control: 2.15 0.93b p 0.0001 CKD with periodontitis: 6.3380 2.74875 Pradeep et al., 2012 CKD: 5.4100 2.65296 Healthy: 1.8350 0.75977b p = 0.000 Female reproductive system diseases Preeclampsia (PE) PE: 13.8 (3.9, 32.3) Cetin et al., 2006 Control: 2.2 (1.2, PTX3 levels are shown in ng/mL, unless indicated. PTX3 levels are also increased in patients with acute myocardial infarction (Peri et al., 2000) the serum PTX3 level is reported to be a biomarker for lung carcinoma. thus, the circulating PTX3 level increases non-specifically in various infections and inflammatory disorders. PTX3-knockout and transgenic mice studies have indicated that the predominant role of PTX3 occurs in host protection in the case of lung injury, infection, vascular damage. it is considered that these functions of PTX3 are exhibited synergistically along with the binding of specific ligands (the details are provided in section \u201cLigands\u201d). Table 2. Responses to certain disorders in PTX3-knockout and PTX3-transgenic mice. mice with mild lupus-like autoimmunity Aggravate autoimmune lung disease in PTX3-KO B6Lpr mice Lech et al., 2011 Kidney ischemia reperfusion injury Less kidney injury and inflammationa Chen et al., 2012 Rolling interaction frequencya Deban et al., 2010 Sexual system Subfertilea Varani et al., 2002 Kainate-induced seizures More widespread seizure-related neuronal damage in PTX3-knockout mice reverse this suppression (Souza et al., 2009) other groups have reported an adverse effect of PTX3 in acute ischemic lung injury and ventilator-induced lung injury (Real et al., 2012). PTX3 is not only involved in complement activation, but also acts as a complement inhibitor to regulate excessive complement activation by binding to C4b-binding proteins and factor H. PTX3 binds to microbial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa. PTX3-knockout mice are susceptible to invasive pulmonary aspergillosis. PTX3-knockout mice exhibit improved phagocytosis of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis. PTX3 also binds to outer membrane protein A from Klebsiella pneumoniae. PTX3 binding to fibroblast growth factor 2 regulates endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, smooth muscle cell activation, and intima thickening after arterial injury. PTX3 binding to fibroblast growth factor 2 regulates endothelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis, smooth muscle cell activation, and intima thickening. PTX3 and its complex component proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-PTX3 antibody-crosslinked magnetic beads. the identified proteins included the known PTX3 ligands such as C1q, ficolins, TSG-6, and I I. these proteins were identified in pooled normal human plasma with artificially spiked recombinant PTX3 complexes. the PTX3 gene is highly conserved across species. the PTX3 gene consists of three exons. the first and second exons encode the signal sequence peptide and the N-terminal domain. the third exon encodes the C-terminal domain. tetramer formation has two states: a tetramer via the inter-disulfide bonds or non-covalent dimerization of the inter-disulfide-bonded dimer. expression pattern PTX3 mRNA expression is induced by primary inflammatory signals in certain cells. the characteristic PTX3 expression pattern is observed in neutrophils. PTX3 is abundantly present in granules, but PTX3 mRNA expression is not detected. in mature neutrophils, the PTX3 protein is abundantly present in granules. circulating PTX3 levels are significantly increased in certain infectious, cardiovascular, kidney, and female reproductive system diseases. the increase can reach up to 10100 times the control level in severe inflammatory and infectious diseases such as sepsis. de Kruif et al., 2010 In ward: 14.2 (7.01, 25.1) Control: 2.30 (1.66, 3.67)d p = 0.01 Bacteremia Non-survivor: 44.8 (10.7, 69.4) Huttunen et al., 2011 Survivor: 6.4 (3.4, 13.5)d p 0.001 Cardiovascular diseases Unstable angina pectoris (UAP) UAP: 6.09 (4.34\u20137.85) ustundag et al., 2011 Control: 0.50 0.39b p 0.001 ACS: 0.36 (0.225, 1.39) Kume et al., 2011 Control: 0.015 (0, 0.06)f p 0.0001 Hypertension Anti-hypertensive mediation Parlak et al., 2012 Pre-treatment: 35.25 5.45 Post-treatment: 0.14 0.19b p 0.0001 Acute ischemic strokes Non- an et al., 2008 Control: 1.8 (0.1, 9.2)d p 0.001 CKD: 7.7 (1.8, 32.9) Yilmaz et al., 2010 Control: 1.3 (0.1, 2.7)f p 0.001 CKD: 3.80 2.35 Nishi et al., 2011 Control: 2.15 0.93b p 0.0001 CKD with periodontitis: 6.3380 2.74875 Pradeep et al. 0.05 Obesity Obesity Obesity Obesity Obesity Obesity in abdominal obesity patients Central obesity: 3.00 2.61 Shim et al., 2010 Control: 0.63 0.81b p 0.01 Severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) non-survivors 9.95 (6.42) Gullo Jda et al., 2011 Survivors 5.46 (4.87)b g/mL p 0.001 Obstruct PTX3-knockout and transgenic mice studies have indicated that the predominant role of PTX3 occurs in host protection in the case of lung injury, infection, vascular damage, and other disorders. PTX3-knockout and transgenic mice studies have indicated that the predominant role of PTX3 occurs in host protection in the case of lung injury, infection, vascular damage, as well as certain other disorders. PTX3 is involved in the organization of hyaluronan in the viscoelastic matrix of cumulus oophorus (Scarchilli et al., 2007). it is considered that these functions of PTX3 are exhibited synergistically along with the binding of specific ligands. Klebsiella pneumoniae Faster lethality by a high inoculum administrationb Soares et al., 2006 Delayed lethality by a mid-to-low inoculum administrationb Soares et al., 2006 Murine cytomegalovirus infection More susceptible to MCMV infectiona Bozza et al., 2006 Influenza virus infection More susceptible to influenza virus infectiona Reading et al., 2008 Others Fas-deficient PTX3 administration to these PTX3-knockout mice reversed this suppression. other groups have also reported an adverse effect of PTX3 in acute ischemic lung injury and ventilator-induced lung injury. PTX3 binds to certain select complement components, such as C1q (Inforzato et al., 2006), C4b-binding proteins (Braunschweig and J\u00f3zsi, 2011), ficolins (Ma et al., 2009; Gout et al., 2011), factor H-like protein 1 (Kopp et al., 2012) and factor H-related protein 1 (Kopp et al. PTX3 binds to microbial pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Garlanda et al., 2002), Salmonella typhimurium (Garlanda et al., 2002), Aspergillus fumigatus (Garlanda et al., 2002), and Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Diniz et al., 2004). PTX3- exogenous PTX3 and endogenously released PTX3 administration suppress neutrophil recruitment. this suggests a negative feedback role of PTX3 that dampens the excessive neutrophil recruitment via selectin P. PTX3-knockout mice exhibit a defect in female fertility because of the defects in ovulation. PTX3 and its complex component proteins were immunoprecipitated by anti-PTX3 antibody-crosslinked magnetic beads. the isolated fractions were subjected to shotgun proteomics analysis for label-free relative quantitation via spectral counting. the identified proteins included the known PTX3 ligands such as C1q, ficolins, TSG-6, and I I. AZU1 preferably binds to the PTX3 N-terminal domain, with a pattern of calcium ion dependency. MPO preferably binds to both the PTX3 N-terminal and C-terminal domains, and does not require calcium ions. plasm S100 calcium-binding protein A8 S100A8 S100 calcium binding protein A12 S100A12 Cytoskeleton Actin (beta and/or gamma 1) ACTB, ACTG1 Yes Myosin-9 MYH9 Yes Alpha-actinin (1 and/or -4) ACTN1, ACTN4 Plastin-2 LCP1 Cytokeratin-10 KRT10 Yes Transketolase TKT Yes From these results, it is NET component proteins identified as PTX3 complex are associated PTX3 in NETs.
