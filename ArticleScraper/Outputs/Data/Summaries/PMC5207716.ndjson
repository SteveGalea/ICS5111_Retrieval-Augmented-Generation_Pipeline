{"summary": "FHV-1 is the major pathogen of feline upper respiratory tract disease (URTD) and ocular disease. it is estimated that FHV-1 infection accounts for approximately 50\u201375% of URTD in susceptible cats. more than 90% of the cats are seropositive to FHV-1. the recombinase is capable of pairing oligonucleotide primers with homologous sequence in the target DNA. SSB then binds to the displaced strand of DNA and prevents dissociation of primers. the strand displacing polymerase begins DNA synthesis. nucleic acid extraction and reverse transcription Viral nucleic acid was isolated from supernatant collected from virus infected cell culture using the TIANamp DNA Extraction Kit. cDNA was purified using the cDNA Purification Kit (Takara Bio Inc.), and quantified using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer. the resultant recombinant plasmid, termed pMD19-T-TK, was replicated in E.coli DH5 cells, extracted and purified using the SanPrep Plasmid MiniPrep Kit. primers for the RPA assay were designed using the Primer 3.0 program following the \u201cprimer design considerations\u201d for RPA. 120 nM exo probe, 14 mM magnesium acetate and 1 L of nucleic acid were prepared in a master mix. reagents except for the template and magnesium acetate were prepared in a 0.2 ml reaction tube containing a dried enzyme pellet. the sample was then pipetted into the tube lids, the lids were closed carefully, and magnesium acetate was centrifuged into the rehydrated material. the detection limit was 102 copies of DNA/reaction for both the exo-RPA assay (panel A) and real time PCR (panel B) the copy numbers used as template for curve 1\u20137 were 106, 105, 104, 103, 102, 101 and 100, respectively. shown in this figure is one representative plot out of 5 independent reactions for RPA and real time PCR. the fluorescent dye FAM was used as a reporter dye in real time PCR. the dye can incorporate into the amplified product, and the intensity is proportional with the relative amount of the PCR product. the dye can be measured in real time and is reflected by the Y-axis value. chlamydia psittaci Feline herpesvirus-1 (FHV-1), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and feline calicivirus (FCV) were purchased from ATCC (ATCC, manassas, USA) and propagated in feline kidney F81 cells. nucleic acid was quantified using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer. the synthesized cDNA was purified using the cDNA Purification Kit. the template was FHV-1 nucleic acid. primers for the RPA assay were designed using the Primer 3.0 program. primers targeting the conserved region of the TK gene were designed. primers and the probe were synthesized by Takara Bio Inc. the tubes were immediately placed in the Genie III Instrument. the fluorescence signal was monitored in real-time. a cutoff value of 3000 was established after 20 min of amplification. FCV, PRV, BHV-1 and C. psittaci tested with the RPA assay. plasmid pMD19-T-TK DNA was serially diluted to achieve DNA concentrations ranging from 106 to 100 copies/L. 1 L of each dilution was amplified by RPA reactions. 2.000e + 005 is a notation for 2 x 105. sensitivity between the RPA reaction and real time PCR was compared. results from 5 independent reactions were statistically analyzed. exo-RPA assay was developed for rapid and specific detection of FHV-1. specificity analysis showed that only FHV-1 DNA was positively amplified. feline calicivirus, FPV, BHV-1, PRV, were all tested negative. weigler et al developed a real time PCR assay for FHV-1 detection. they used agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining to visualize the PCR product. as low as 3x103 copies of FHV-1 genomic DNA could be detected. compared with real time PCR, RPA has several advantages. the RPA assay is a simple, fast and cost-effective alternative to real time PCR for specific detection of FHV-1."}
