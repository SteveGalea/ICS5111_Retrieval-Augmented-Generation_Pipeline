{"summary": "arenaviral classification, evolution, and ecology The family Arenaviridae is divided into 3 genera based on their natural hosts. Mammarenaviridae are further classified into the regions of their origins, such as the Old World (OW) viruses found in west africa (3\u20139) and the New World (NW) viruses found in south America (5, 10\u201317), which are believed to have originated 23,000 and 41,000 years ago. phylogenetic tree for OW and NW arenaviral strains and geographic locations. hashtags designate strains that cause natural human diseases. arenaviral and rodent host phylogenetic trees almost never match. three reptarenaviruses isolated from boa constrictors and annulated tree boas have been found to be causative agents of IBD. these three reptarenaviruses have been found to be causative agents of Inclusion Body Disease (IBD), a fatal condition in snakes characterized by neurological abnormalities (37, 38), large eosinophilic aggregations inside infected cells (37\u201340) the tri-segmented Bunyaviridae family found widely in arthropods (2, 45) that can also cause severe and lethal hemorrhagic infections in humans. changes in the viral polymerase of the mammarenaviruses may be more associated with older adaptive events dating to the speciation of NW arenaviruses. the concept of viral proteins mediating host immune evasion will be discussed further below. the L RdRp polymerase exhibits the least conservation among the arenaviral proteins. 7896, (Lassa 2018 pandemic S), FR832710 (Lassa AV L), FR832711 (Lassa AV S), FR832711 (Lassa AV S), KF478762 (Lassa Soromba L), KF478765 (Lassa Soromba S), NC_010760 (Latino L), NC_010758 (Latino S), the S segment of the Lassa virus genome is sufficient to maintain pathogenicity. recombinant wildtype and reassorted Lassa viruses carry different large (L) and small (S) segments from different strains of the virus. rice is often the stable crop in endemic areas (particularly in western Africa) 76% of residents in a Nigerian urban town had inadequate knowledge of Lassa fever and 51% had poor control practices (51) practices such as hunting rodents for food and for use in sacrificial ceremonies have also been documented to increase risk for infection (50) arenaviruses are enveloped, ambisense single-stranded RNA viruses. their structure consists of a membrane envelope containing the surface glycoprotein (GP) subunits surrounding a capsid. the viral bi-segmented genome encapsulated by the nucleoprotein (NP) proteolytically cleaves GPC into its three final subunits. GP1 forms spikes protruding from the viral envelope. GP2 is a class 1 fusion transmembrane protein by virtue of its 6 helix domain (85, 86) LASV and LCMV were first discovered to use -dystroglycan as their cellular entry receptor (97), which was later confirmed to be the case for all OW and clade C NW arenaviruses (98). -dystroglycan is necessary for recognition by arenaviruses (99\u2013101), which mimics the interaction between -dystroglycan and its natural ligand laminin (102) residues at the trimeric interface of the GP were recently found to be critical for cell entry. the endosomal cellular protein LAMP1 has been identified as a critical host factor for mediating a \u201cpH-switch\u201d mechanism of virus-cellular membranes fusion and endocytosis of the virion particle. non-pathogenic clade B viruses use hTrf1 orthologs (124, 125) non-pathogenic clade B viruses use hTrf1. TRIM2 has recently been identified as an inhibitor of NW arenaviral cell entry by a yet undetermined mechanism (129) the viral NP and L proteins are the minimum known components required for viral genome replication and transcription. the viral Z protein is an inhibitor of the viral polymerase's transcriptional initiation function (137\u2013140). the viral genomic RNA structural elements play important roles in the regulatory mechanisms of viral genome replication, transcription, and gene expression. viral RNA sensing and innate immune evasion strategies by arenaviruses and on efforts to develop vaccines will be discussed in detail below. both sense and anti-sense RNAs associating with cytosolic compartments containing viral NP and host factors involved in RNA metabolism. recent advances in antibody-mediated dsRNA visualization (151) and specific probing for genomic and anti-genomic arenaviral RNA (152) show much promise for elucidating the dynamics of arena the late domains located in the C-terminal part of the Z protein may also be required for the release of the so-called defective interfering (DI) virion particles from the infected cells. a recent report suggests that the late domains located in the C-terminal part of the Z protein may also be required for the release of the so-called defective interfering (DI) particles from the infected cells. the host subtilase SK1-S1P proteolytically cleaves GPC into its three final subunits (79\u201381) GP1 forms spikes protruding from the viral envelope and is responsible for interacting with entry receptors. GP2 is a class 1 fusion transmembrane protein by virtue of its 6 helix domain (85, 86) OW and clade C NW arenaviruses were first discovered to use -dystroglycan as their cellular entry receptor (97) -dystroglycan mimics the interaction between -dystroglycan and its natural ligand laminin (102) -dystroglycan is a driving genetic force in arenaviral endemic regions. residues at the trimeric interface of the GP were recently found to be critical for cell entry. the endosomal cellular protein LAMP1 has been identified as a critical host factor for mediating a \u201cpH-switch\u201d mechanism of virus-cellular membranes fusion and endocytosis of the virion particle. clade B NW arenaviruses have been found to use human transferrin receptor 1 (hTrf1) (122, 123) and non-pathogenic clade B viruses use hTrf1 orthologs (124, 125) TRIM2 has recently been identified as an inhibitor of NW arenaviral cell entry by a yet undetermined mechanism (129) viral NP and L proteins are the minimum known components required for viral genome replication and transcription. the viral Z protein is an inhibitor of the viral polymerase's transcriptional initiation function (137\u2013140). the viral genomic RNA structural elements play important roles in the regulatory mechanisms of viral genome replication, transcription, and gene expression. viral RNA decoy by competitively inhibiting the viral RNA sensing by the innate-immune machinery (149) molecular mechanisms of viral RNA sensing and innate immune evasion strategies by arenaviruses and on efforts to develop vaccines will be discussed in detail below. the localization of arenaviral RNAs has also been found to be important for replication control, with both sense and anti-sense RNAs associating with cytosolic compartments containing viral a recent report suggests that the late domains located in the C-terminal part of the Z protein may also be required for the release of the so-called defective interfering (DI) virion particles from the infected cells. these deletions have been observed in the 3'UTR regions of the LCMV genome and potentially elsewhere in the viral genome. d in 431 laboratory confirmed cases that include 37 health care workers. previous outbreaks have recorded lower mortality rate in hospitalized patients. previous outbreaks have recorded lower mortality rate in hospitalized patients. monocytic cells are thought to act as a viral \u201creservoir\u201d early in infection. the virus can easily enter, and virus later spreads when these cells enter draining lymph nodes. the failure of these cells to become activated is consistent with the observation of the generalized immunodepression in severely and fatally infected individuals. the NF-B pathway is activated by recognition of certain features of the virus particles by the membrane receptors TLR 2 or TLR 6. this initiates a molecular cascade resulting in the translocation of the two functional NF-B units into the nucleus, resulting in more production of NF-B. OW arenaviral infection (e.g., LASV) in patients with moderate to severe symptoms is associated with inhibition of the innate immune response with decreased levels of IFN1 and pro-inflammatory cytokines. in vivo infection of non-human primates and guinea pigs with the LASV Soromba strain shows a significant increase in cytokine signaling and decrease in mortality compared to other LASV strains. the OW LCMV is capable of maintaining persistent infection with low levels of IFN1 signaling (225, 226) mice display an IFN1 burst 6\u201348 h after infection and 2\u20134 days before a peak in viral titers. the difference between the immune responses in rodents and humans is one of the key aspects of active investigations. NP directly interacts with the m7GpppN mRNA cap structure (241) NP prevents potentiation of RIG-I function by the cellular protein PACT. exoribonuclease domain is also required for NP inhibition of the cellular protein kinase IKK (248) and other cellular proteins in the IRF pathway. the ability of NP to inhibit IFN1 expression by degrading PAMP dsRNA is likely conserved across known arenaviruses. the ability of NP to inhibit IFN1 expression by degrading PAMP dsRNA is likely conserved across known arenaviruses. LCMV Z was sufficient to inhibit macrophage activation when expressed as a chimeric Z protein with the non-pathogenic PICV (259) the Z protein is emerging as another key target in investigating the mechanism of innate immune suppression by arenaviruses. a key pattern that has emerged from preliminary studies is the role of innate immune cells and cytokines in initiating the adaptive immune response against mammarenaviral infection. innate-adaptive interface was recapitulated in a recent co-infection model of LCMV and E. Coli. CD8 T cells have been found to be indispensable for clearing arenaviruses. CD4 T cell (277, 280) and antibody (184) responses have been found to be dispensable. potential contributing factor toward arenaviral pathogenicity may be a skewed CD4+ T cell response. OW arenaviruses share 75% amino acid identity and the Mastomys natalensis African rat as a viral reservoir. MOPV is non-pathogenic in humans and has been considered as a potential LASV vaccine candidate in non-human primates. a chimeric LASV with a substitution of its GP with that of MOPV has been found to significantly increase IFN1 production (288), which may reflect different mechanisms of viral detection based on the different innate immune receptors. a chimeric LASV with a substitution of its GP with that of MOPV has been found to significantly increase IFN1 production (288), which may reflect different mechanisms of viral detection based on the different innate immune receptors. OW arenaviruses fail to induce apoptosis (204, 298) or induce significantly delayed apoptosis (299) the relative contributions of pathways directly mediated by the specific cellular receptor and other viral signaling mechanisms needs to be further characterized in future studies. a number of viral nucleoproteins can block PACT enhancement of RIG-I function. NP does not appear to negatively impact PACT/RIG-I direct interaction, suggesting that NP may inhibit PACT indirectly by degrading dsRNA that may be associated with the complex. dsRNA binding is an absolute requirement to inhibit PACT-induced RIG-I activation. these studies illustrate the lack of detail understanding of the roles of the different viral proteins to inhibit PACT-mediated RIG-I activation. antivirals targeting PACT can influence PACT-PKR mediated NF-B and p53 stress signaling. mutation in Machupo virus (MACV) was also found to be attenuated in mice. a mutation in the SSP subunit along with the F427I mutation in GP2 is thought to prevent the virus from reverting to its wild type sequence. it is tempting to assume similar attenuation techniques can be applied toward the development of other arenaviral vaccines. adaptive immunity has been induced in vaccinated subjects, but has failed to protect against lethal viral challenge. novel reverse genetic strategies are being explored to overcome these obstacles, such as codon optimization to increase the expression of viral protein antigens (334), tri-segmented arenaviral vectors on LCMV (335\u2013339) or PICV (340, 341) backbones to increase viral attenuation. phavirus replicons and inactivated rabies virus have been shown to exhibit various protective efficacies against LASV infection in different animal models. other LASV vaccine development efforts include those that are based on new vaccine platforms, such as a recombinant measles-virus-based vaccine (358) and DNA-based vaccine (359, 360) CD4+ T-cells can provide partial protection of ML29-vaccinated animals against lethal LASV challenge. depletion of CD8+ T-cells abolishes protection (370) NP-specific CD8+ T-cells play a major protective role in mice infected with LCMV (279) amphipathic DNA polymers have been found to block LCMV GP--dystroglycan interaction by virtue of its hydrophobicity rather than nucleotide sequence. a number of other compounds have been found to stabilize the GP--dystroglycan prefusion complex formation, thereby blocking pH-mediated endocytosis. a variety of mechanistic effects have been characterized for one of these compounds. for example, the NSC20625 compound has been found to induce Z to unfold and accumulate in oligomeric structures. the arenaviral L polymerase and NP have experienced the least progress as drug targets. r scale drug screens seem to implicate cellular kinase inhibition as a promising anti-viral target in general. compounds affecting arenaviruses at multiple stages of the virus life cycle (409\u2013414) may have additive effects when used in conjunction with nucleoside analogs (412) this may be possible to target immune signaling proteins as anti-viral control.
