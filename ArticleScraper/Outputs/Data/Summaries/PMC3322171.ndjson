{"summary": "in the united states, over 100,000 people are hospitalized and over 20,000 people die every year due to influenza virus infection and related diseases. despite large-scale efforts in vaccination and antiviral therapies, the morbidity and mortality rates associated with influenza infections have not significantly changed in recent years. the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century emerged in march 2009. it was responsible for an estimated 258,698 laboratory confirmed cases and roughly 1,370 deaths by December 2009. the normal \u201cFlu Season\u201d occurs during the colder half of the year in each hemisphere [18]. studies have shown a correlation between inflammation and oxidative stress which alters expression of these proteases and antiproteases. a murine study showed SLPI expression was suppressed and protease expression was increased in Nrf2-deficient mice which led to increased inflammation. the imbalance of protease/antiprotease expression caused by oxidative stress has been attributed to both an increase in inflammatory cells. we used our established cell culture model of differentiated human nasal epithelial cells (NECs) [46], exposed them to 0.4ppm of ozone, and determined the effects on susceptibility to an influenza infection. exposure to ozone disrupts this equilibrium by enhancing protease secretion while inhibiting antiprotease expression leading to increased susceptibility to viral infection. bronchial epithelial cell basic medium (BEBM) and DMEM-H were grown in a mixture of bronchial epithelial cell basic medium (BEBM) and DMEM-H with singleQuot supplements (Cambrex), bovine pituitary extracts (13 mg/ml), bovine serum albumin (BSA, 1.5 g/ml), and nystatin (20 units). Upon confluency, all-trans retinoi the influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/34/Mount Sinai (H1N1) M1 sequence was PCR amplified from pcDNA3.1 and fused N-terminally to M1 within pCAGGS to create a modified -lactamase-M1 fusion. the first 24 amino acids were excluded to remove a secretion signal and His 24 was substituted with Asp to create an optimal Kozak consensus sequence. 293T cells were co-transfected with 3 g each of pCAGGS-HA, pDZ-NA, and pCAGGS-lacM1 PR8 using FuGENE\u00ae HD. the supernatant was collected 48 h post-transfection and clarified of floating cell debris by centrifugation at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. virus was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated hen's eggs. stock virus was aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. 5105 cells were infected with 128 hemagglutination units of influenza A. ate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell Biosciences, Keene, NH). proteins were detected using specific antibodies to HAT, TMPRSS2, and SPLI (11,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) -actin (12,000; US Biological, Swampscott, MA), which was used as a loading control. proteins were detected using antibodies to HAT, TMPRSS2, and SPLI (11,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or Influenza A virus hemagglutinin H1 antibody (11,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) titers in apical washes were determined by 50% tissue-culture infectious dose (TCID50) in Madin Darby canine kidney cells. wells exhibiting hemagglutination were considered positive and virus titers were expressed as log TCID50. after 3 days incubation, a suspension of human erythrocytes (0.5%) was added to each well. basolateral supernatants were collected for the measurement of LDH concentration according to the manufacturer's recommendations. released IL-6 concentration was expressed as optical density. SLPI trans-activation reporter assay was cotransfected with either 0.1 g of SLPI-luciferase reporter assay. primary human nasal epithelial cells (NECs) were obtained from healthy adult volunteers by gently stroking the inferior surface of the turbinate several times with a Rhino-Probe curette. this protocol was approved by the University of North Carolina School of Medicine Institutional Review Board for Biomedical Research. the primary human NECs were exposed under ALI conditions to filtered air or 0.4 ppm ozone for 4 h. 10 mM of a cell-permeable form of reduced glutathione, glutathione-ethylester (GSH-ET) or 1 M of EGCG (Sigma-Aldrich St. Louis. Mo) was added to the basolateral medium 30 min prior to ozone exposure. the pcDNA3.1-lactamase construct has been described previously [51]. 293T cells were co-transfected with 3 g each of pCAGGS-HA, pDZ-NA, and pCAGGS-lacM1 PR8. unbound virus and infected cells were detected by using geneBLAzerTM FRET in vivo cell-based assay system substrate CCF2-AM. samples were lysed in HBSS by freeze-thaw method repeatedly treated for 3 cycles. all experiments were performed in triplicate in three independent experiments. 293T cells were co-transfected with 3 g each of pCAGGS-HA, pDZ-NA, and pCAGGS--lacM1 PR8. the supernatant containing the VLPs was collected 48 h post-transfection. the retentates were aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C. all experiments were performed in triplicate in three independent experiments. influenza A was propagated in 10-day-old embryonated hen's eggs. stock virus was aliquoted and stored at 80\u00b0C until use. both the apical supernatants and cellular lysates were subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to nitrocellulose (Schleicher & Schuell Biosciences, Keene, NH) protein concentrations were determined by Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) virus was subjected to 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. protein was detected using antibodies to HAT, TMPRSS2, and SPLI (11,000; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA) or Influenza A virus hemagglutinin H1 antibody (11,000; Abcam, Cambridge, MA) MDCK cells grown in round-bottom 96-well plates were inoculated with the above samples diluted in serum-free DMEM or serum-free DMEM containing 20 g/ml trypsin. after 3 days incubation, a suspension of human erythrocytes (0.5%) was added to each well. measurements of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and interleukin-6 levels NECs were exposed to filtered air or 0.4 ppm ozone for 4 h. released IL-6 concentration was expressed as optical density. oxidative stress increases susceptibility to ozone and that these responses may be mediated via increased viral entry [6], [46]. we chose to examine influenza infection in human NECs exposed to 0.4ppm of ozone for 4 h. basolateral supernatants collected 24 h post-exposure were analyzed for IL-6 levels. total RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR to quantify Influenza HA transcripts and normalized to the expression of -actin. ozone exposure does not affect cellular antiviral responses. exposure to ozone does not alter baseline expression of host antiviral immune response genes. cultures of differentiated human epithelial cells were exposed to either 0.4ppm of ozone or air for 4 h. 1 M of EGCG or 10 mM of GSH-ET is sufficient to detect an increase in Nrf2 expression or counteract oxidative stress induced by diesel exhaust exposure in NECs. these concentrations also correlate with levels of EGCG achievable in vivo [63], [64], [65]. RNA was isolated and subjected to RT-PCR to quantify Influenza HA transcripts and normalized to the expression of -actin. cells were infected with influenza A/Bangkok/1/79 after 24 h post-infection. cells were exposed to either 0.4ppm of ozone or air for 4 h. 24 h post ozone exposure cells were infected with PR8 -lacM1 VLP. ozone disrupts host protease/antiproteases balance. we investigated the protease/antiprotease balance on the epithelial surface in the context of an acute ozone exposure. for these experiments we exposed our NECs to either air or ozone for 4 h. both apical surface liquid and cell lysates were collected to characterize secreted/soluble and membrane-bound intracellular levels of HAT, TMPRSS2 and SLPI. ozone exposure modulates cellular protease and anti-protease levels. cultures of differentiated human epithelial cells were exposed to either 0.4ppm of ozone or air for 4 h. apical supernatants were analyzed for secreted SLPI, TMPRSS2 and HAT protein levels. supernatants were analyzed for secreted SLPI, TMPRSS2 and HAT protein levels. beAS-2B cells were co-transfected with SLPI-Luc and TK-Renilla. cells were harvested 8 h post-treatment and analyzed. apical washes from NECs were immunoprecitipated with anti-HAT, anti-TMPRSS2 and IgG. the cleared supernatants were incubated with influenza A/Malaya/302/1954 H1N1. cultures of differentiated human epithelial cells were exposed to either 0.4ppm of ozone or air for 4 h. apical supernatants were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti- HAT, anti- TMPRSS2 or an isotype control (IgG) protein levels were analyzed by Western blot. secreted proteases present in the apical surface liquid from NECs exposed to air or ozone are functional and can propagate viral entry and replication. this correlates with the increase in protease expression post ozone exposure (Figure 5B), viral entry (Figure 4), and viral replication (Figure 1C and 1D). rhSLPI directly inhibits trypsin-mediated cleavage of viral HA leading to decreased infection and replication. exposure to ozone disrupts protease/antiprotease balance resulting in greater secretion of endogenous proteases leading to increased viral entry. 24 h post-infection total RNA was subjected to real time RT-PCR to quantitate the influenza viral hemagglutinin transcript (HA) as compared to the filtered air control. apical washes for influenza viral titers 24 h post-infection showed a significant increase in viral titers in ozone exposed cells. ozone alone had no significant effect on mRNA expression in any of the four antiviral genes as compared to the air control. exposure to ozone does not alter baseline expression of host antiviral immune response genes. NECs were treated with either a potent phase-II antioxidant inducer or a direct antioxidant. previous reports have shown that oxidative stress increases susceptibility to influenza infection. exposure to ozone significantly increases viral HA expression. both EGCG and GSH-ET significantly reduced viral replication. antioxidant supplementation suppresses viral replication in NECs. the increased susceptibility to influenza after ozone exposure most likely happens early in the virus lifecycle, upstream of viral replication. cells were infected with a VLP that only express the hemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA) and matrix (M) proteins. in cells in which the PR8 -lacM1 VLP has entered, the substrate will be cleaved. 24 h post ozone exposure cells were infected with PR8 -lacM1 VLP. at 4 h post-infection, cells were loaded with CCF2-AM substrate and assayed for viral entry. transmembrane protease, HAT, was found to be secreted in an in vitro overexpression system. the levels of the secreted forms of HAT, TMPRSS2 and SLPI were significantly changed by ozone exposure. ozone-induced oxidative stress disrupts protease/antiprotease balance. cultures of differentiated human epithelial cells were exposed to either 0.4ppm of ozone or air for 4 h. samples were subjected to Western blot analysis to detect SLPI, TMPRSS2 and -actin. membrane was stripped and analyzed for -actin as a loading control. tinin cleavage We characterized the cleavage products of the viral HA protein to determine if the proteases produced by acute ozone exposure can cleave an intact influenza virion. the cells were exposed to air or ozone and 24 h post-exposure, cells were infected with influenza A/Malaya/302/1954 H1N1. secreted proteases are functional for Hemagglutinin cleavage. cultures of differentiated human epithelial cells were exposed to either 0.4ppm of ozone or air for 4 h. secreted proteases are functional and can activate Influenza A virions to propagate a viral infection. we used a modified infectivity viral titer assay to test functionality and the role they play in a viral infection. this is because the addition of a known serine protease inhibitor, PMSF, significantly inhibits viral replication. cultures of differentiated human epithelial cells were exposed to either 0.4ppm of ozone or air for 4 h. rhSLPI (8 nM, 40 nM, 200 nM, 1000 nM) were incubated with media containing 20 g/ml trypsin for 60 min. each experiment was performed in triplicate. ozone exposure is a major source of oxidative stress in the airway epithelium. it is important to determine the role ozone exposure plays in viral infections. the role of ozone exposure in viral replication and pathogenesis remains to be defined. exposure to ozone elicited the typical pro-inflammatory and cellular damage responses as seen with increased release of IL-6 and LDH. we assessed the transcription levels of 4 classical antiviral mediators; RIG-I, IFN-, IFN-, and TLR-3. despite years of effort, the exact protease(s) that activates influenza has yet to be identified. despite many years of effort, the exact protease(s) that activates influenza has yet to be identified. SLPI is detected in the secreted airway and oxidative stress reduces the expression and function of the protein. oxidative stress reduces the expression and function of the protein. this could explain the increased morbidity and mortality associated with the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. emphysema showed that Nrf2 expression exerts a protective effect through the transcriptional activation of antiproteases [88]. the same group showed that Nrf2 expression exerts a protective effect through the transcriptional activation of antiproteases. we show a direct inverse relationship between levels of secreted SLPI and secreted protease expression. this mechanism could be exploited as a novel anti-viral therapy in combination with conventional antiviral treatments. antiproteases appear to protect the respiratory epithelium from influenza virus infection. nutritional supplements may increase the antiprotease:protease ratio."}
