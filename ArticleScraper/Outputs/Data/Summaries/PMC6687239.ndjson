{"summary": "10.7 million unauthorized immigrants are living in the united states. the risk of exposing their lack of citizenship or criminal status may result in their unwillingness to comply with a government-ordered or voluntary quarantine. unauthorized immigrants comprise nearly one fourth of the total workforce in agriculture7 and home health care. criminal offenders are \"an important yet underappreciated aspect of law enforcement and policy-making across the nation\" the number of individuals who have committed a crime is unknown. 10.7 million unauthorized immigrants are living in the united states. most undocumented immigrants enter the country without authorization. an increasing number of individuals enter the country legally each year but overstay their visas, thereby changing their status to unauthorized. the number of fugitives residing in the united states is unknown. arrest warrants may be issued for minor offenses, such as a failure to appear for a traffic violation. other individuals may be delinquent in child support payments or owe fines to government. approximately 20.2 million adults aged 18 years or older had a substance use disorder. substance abuse is pervasive, but only 2.5 million adults enter treatment. the only conceivable way of inducing these individuals to comply is to provide medical treatment of substance use disorders. ECONOMIC JEOPARDY Many individuals in the united states have a tenuous employment status, with no employment security and a realistic fear of losing their job if they fail to show up for work. under current law, employees without a contrary contractual provision may be discharged for absence from work. laws have been enacted in 10 states to prohibit discrimination in employment against individuals in quarantine. only 3 states (MA, MN, NJ) provide for employees to recover lost wages. the other state laws only provide for reinstatement or penalties assessed against the employer. in an epidemic, income support for people in quarantine is essential. avoiding the issue only threatens to delay and undermine the emergency response. public officials need to exhibit foresight and courage. the alternative of a potentially ineffective quarantine in response to a deadly epidemic or pandemic would surely be much worse. the political difficulties in enacting and implementing the laws necessary to promote compliance with quarantine should give government officials some pause before advocating or imposing a quarantine."}
