{"summary": "Baphicacanthus cusia (Nees) Bremek is widely distributed in southern china. its roots are used as a traditional Chinese medicine for its antibacterial, antiviral, and immunoregulatory effects. its leaves and stems are used to extract indigo naturalis (Qingdai) the genetic information of B. cusia for molecular biology research is limited in public databases. the mRNA has recently been sequenced, and the partial contigs have already been deposited into the national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) database. real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is a sensitive, specific, and reproducible technique widely used to analyze the expression of genes in different organisms and tissues. however, it is necessary to select suitable reference genes as internal controls under different experimental conditions for accurate RT-qPCR evaluation. the best suitable reference gene should be evaluated with target genes associated with experimental conditions. terpenoid indole alkaloids (TIAs) are important medicinal ingredients in B. cusia. they are activated in response to hormonal stresses. a total of 60 samples were analyzed, consisting of 12 organ-specific samples (root, stem, leaf, and flower) and 48 stress-treated samples (MeJA-, ABA-, and UV-treated leaves) total RNA was extracted from all plant tissue samples using a column plant Total RNA Kit (TransGen Biotech, China) following the manufacturer's recommendations. transcriptome sequencing of different B. cusia organs was performed using the Illumina Hi-Seq 2500 platform (Illumina, America) 10 candidate reference genes belonging to different functional classes were selected to avoid possible co-regulation of the genes. gene name Gene length (bp)* NR accession number ROOT_FPKM STEM_FPKM 18S c65364_g1_i1 18S rRNA 5807 18S ribosomal RNA[Neochloris vigenis] M74496.1 1721.05 2826.45 CYP c249980_g1_i1 Cyclophilin 1212 Cyclophilin [Momordica charantia] HQ17 amplification primers for real-time PCR were designed using the Primer3 software (http://www.simgene.com/Primer3) to control genomic DNA contamination. the presence of spurious products of amplification caused by genomic DNA was continuously checked by verifying RT-qPCR dissociation profile. et al., 2009), and the values were used in all subsequent analyses (Table 2). Primer sequences of selected candidate reference genes, primers, and amplicon characteristics were used. reaction components without template were used as a negative control. the amplification program was set as follows: initial denaturation step of 95\u00b0C for 30 s to activate the DNA polymerase, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 s and annealing at 60\u00b0C for 30 s. geNorm and NormFinder convert raw Ct-values into relative quantities using the formula 2Ct (Ct = each corresponding Ct-value \u2013 lowest Ct-value) for bestKeeper, the Ct-value in the program was used directly. genes with standard deviation (SD) >1 were considered to be unacceptable as reference genes. a total of 60 samples were analyzed, consisting of 12 organ-specific samples (root, stem, leaf, and flower) and 48 stress-treated samples (MeJA-, ABA-, and UV-treated leaves) after collection, the samples were immediately frozen in liquid N2 and stored at 80\u00b0C until further use. over, E-mix, and R-mix to 1 g of total RNA. the total volume (20 L) was incubated at 42\u00b0C for 15 min. cDNA solution was stored at 20\u00b0C.
