{"summary": "mycoplasma pneumoniae is a common causative pathogen of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children and young adults. adenovirus causes acute respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years old. airborne adenovirus and bacterial (Mycoplasma pneumoniae) concentrations at pediatric emergency room and pediatric outpatient department of the Children's Hospital in northern Taiwan were evaluated for one year. a medical center, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital with 3,500 beds located in north Taiwan, was selected in this study. the indoor temperature, RH and CO2 concentration were determined using a digital psychrometer (TSI incorporated 500 Cardigan Road, Shoreview, MN 55126, USA) the portable DUSTcheck monitor (Grimm, model 1.108, Germany) was used to measure the mass concentrations of particulate matters. values of calibration curves were 0.99 for adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. a two-sample t test was used to assess the differences of detection rates between adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. the indoor air was filtered through a plastic cassette with a 0.2 m polytetrafluoroethylene filter at an airflow rate of 12 L/min (LPM) 186 filter samples were collected and the filters were immediately stored at 70\u00b0C until they were analyzed. real-time quantitative PCR assay table 1 presented sequences of primers and probes for adenovirus and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. concentrations of calibration standards ranged from 10 to 106 copies/L for adenovirus and 10 to 104 copies/L for mycoplasma pneumoniae. the air temperatures and relative humidity were 16.1\u201326.6\u00b0C and 42.5\u201377.7%, respectively, in the pediatric emergency room and in the pediatric outpatient department. the CO2 concentrations were 404\u2013704 ppm in the pediatric emergency room and 372\u20132,575 ppm in the pediatric outpatient department. airborne particles that contained adenovirus were detected in the pediatric emergency room throughout the year except in March to May, and October. the airborne particles that contained adenovirus concentrations ranged between 10 copies/m3 and 104 copies/m3 in the pediatric emergency room. median concentration of airborne adenovirus DNA was highest in December. concentrations of Mycoplasma pneumoniae in airborne particles ranged between 114 copies/m3 and 9.9104 copies/m3 in the pediatric outpatient department. median concentration of Mycoplasma pneumoniae DNA product in the pediatric outpatient department was highest in October. the pediatric outpatient department of the hospital was close at nighttime. the monthly detection rate of airborne adenovirus DNA products in the filter samples in the pediatric outpatient department was lower than that in the pediatric emergency room. the measured viral concentrations in the pediatric outpatient department significantly exceeded those measured in the pediatric emergency room. the relationship between the number of infected patients and the number of air samples with detected certain pathogens warrants further investigation. indoor air quality is important to prevent infection and thereby protect patients and health care workers in hospitals."}
