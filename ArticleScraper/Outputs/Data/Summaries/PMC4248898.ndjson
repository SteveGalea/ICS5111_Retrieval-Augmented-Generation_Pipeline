{"summary": "aMPV is an economically important pathogen that causes an acute, highly contagious respiratory disease in turkeys. it is the etiological agent of swollen-head syndrome in chickens (1, 3). aMPV was first identified in 1996, in a commercial turkey flock with respiratory diseases in Colorado (9. subtypes A, B, and D are found mainly in Europe and Asia (5\u20138) aMPV subtype C shares more homology with hMPV than the other three aMPV subtypes (15, 16) aMPV subtype C shares more homology with hMPV than the other three aMPV subtypes (15, 16) turkeys were shown to be susceptible to hMPV infection (17). aMPV vaccine reverted to a virulent strain and became persistent in the field. the large (L) polymerase protein of NNS RNA viruses is a multifunctional protein that possesses all of the enzymatic activities for genome replication, mRNA synthesis, and mRNA modifications including capping, methylation, and polyadenylation. mRNA cap formation is a novel and universal target for drug discovery and vaccine development. small molecules that inhibit mRNA capping would likely be lethal to virus. inhibition of mRNA cap methylation may yield attenuated strains that can be used for the development of live vaccine candidates. aMPV-CO and aMPV-MN were originally isolated from turkey flocks in Colorado and Minnesota. both strains were virulent in turkeys and were grown in vero-E6 cells as previously described. rVSV-K1651A lacks both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation. plasmids expressing aMPV N (pCDNA3-N), P (pCDNA3-P), L (pCDNA3-L) and M2-1 (pCDNA3-M2-1) proteins were generated previously. the cells were subjected to three freeze-thaw cycles, followed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 10 min. the supernatant was used subsequently to infect new Vero-E6 cells. the successful recovery of the raMPV stocks was confirmed by agarose overlay plaque assay and reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) titer was determined by plaque assay or TCID50. vero-E6 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a density of 105 cells per well. cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density of 2 106 cells per well. the cells were infected with 400 l of a 10-fold dilution series of each virus. each raMPV mutant was repeatedly passaged 12 times in vero-E6 cells. each raMPV mutant was repeatedly passaged 12 times. at passage 12, the entire genome of each recombinant virus was amplified by RT-PCR and sequenced. an in vitro trans-methylation assay was performed using a method reported by Zust et al. the methylation of the mRNA cap structure was measured by 3H incorporation using a 1414 series scintillation counter. the ccpm was normalized by virus-specific mRNA. a trans-ribose 2\u2032-O methylation assay was performed using mRNA purified from raMPV mutant-infected or rVSV mutant-infected cells. 105 2-week-old turkey poults were randomly allotted into six groups. each inoculated group was separately housed in cages under biosafety level 2 conditions. turkeys in group 1 were inoculated with DMEM and served as the unimmunized control (negative control) after vaccination, the animals were observed for mortality and morbidity associated with aMPV infection. tracheal and pulmonary histology were evaluated based on clinical signs, viral replication, and tracheal and pulmonary histology. animal experiment 3: protection efficacy against challenge with heterologous aMPV-MN strain. titers were calculated as aMPV-specific neutralizing antibody titers. the swabs were eluted in 1 ml of DMEM by vortexing for 1 min. the swabs were eluted in 1 ml of DMEM by vortexing for 1 min. the PCR products were purified and sequenced at the Ohio State University plant microbe genetics facility. the initial recovered virus stocks might contain original plasmid DNA. the stocks were digested with DNase I (Invitrogen), followed by RNA extraction and RT-PCR. total RNA was extracted from sinus and tracheal swabs and from lungs. aMPV subtype C Minnesota strain (aMPV/Minnesota/turkey/2a/97 [aMPV-MN]) was obtained from the pathogen repository bank at the Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory. both strains were virulent in turkeys and were grown in vero-E6 cells as previously described (1, 31) recombinant aMPVs (raMPVs) were rescued using a reverse-genetics system. the cells were harvested using scrapers and cocultured with 50 to 60% confluent Vero-E6 cells. the raMPV stocks used in animal studies were grown in vero-E6 cells. agarose overlay plaque assay and reverse transcription-PCR were confirmed. raMPV or mutant raMPV washed three times with phosphate-buffered saline. cells were harvested by three freeze-thaw cycles, followed by centrifugation at 1,500 g at room temperature (RT) for 15 min. aMPV plaque assay was performed using a procedure described previously. agitation every 10 min, the cells in each well were overlaid with 2.5 ml of Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 1% agarose, 1% FBS, 0.075% sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3), 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.7), 2 mM l-glutamine, 12.5 mg/ml of penicillin, 4 mg/ml of streptomycin, and 4 mg/ml of kan an in vitro trans-methylation assay was performed using a method reported by Zust et al. with some modifications (34). confluent Vero-E6 cells in 150-mm dishes were mock infected or infected by raMPV mutants or rVSV mutants at an MOI of 0.1 in the presence of actinomycin D (0.6 g/ml) the ccpm was normalized by virus-specific mRNA. a trans-ribose 2\u2032-O methylation assay was performed using mRNA purified from raMPV mutant-infected or rVSV mutant-infected cells. the ccpm was normalized by virus-specific mRNA. seventy-two 2-week-old poults randomly allotted into six groups. each inoculated group was separately housed in cages under biosafety level 2 conditions. poults in group 7 were mock infected with 200 l of DMEM. turkeys in group 7 were challenged with raMPV-CO at a dose of 1.0 106 TCID50 per turkey. the animals were observed for mortality and morbidity associated with aMPV infection. at 3, 5, and 7 days postchallenge, 5 poults from each group were euthanized. 105 2-week-old turkey poults were randomly divided to seven groups. the experimental design and procedure were identical to those described for animal experiment 2 except that the challenge virus was changed to aMPV-MN. Histology. the swabs were eluted in 1 ml of DMEM by vortexing for 1 min. after centrifugation, the left lung from each turkey poult was removed, weighed, and homogenized in 5 ml of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) solution. total RNA was extracted from sinus and tracheal swabs and from lungs by a Qiagen minikit. a total of 200 l of homogenized lung tissue samples and 150 l of sinus and tracheal swab fluids were used for viral RNA extraction. rVSV-G1670A and -G1672A were specifically defective in G-N-7 but not 2\u2032-O methylation. rVSV-G1675A abolished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation by approximately 70%. the equivalent amino acids in aMPV L protein include G1696, G1698, G1700, N1701, and D1755. aMPV-CO, avian metapneumovirus Colorado strain; aMPV-MN, avian metapneumovirus Minnesota strain; HMPV, human metapneumovirus; HRSV, human respiratory syncytial virus; BRSV, bovine respiratory syncytial virus; PVM, pneumonia virus of mice; PVM, paramyxovirinae (MeV, Measles virus; HV, Hendra virus plaque sizes of raMPV-G1696A, -G1700A, -N1701A, and -D1755A were 0.92 0.34 mm, 1.12 0.24 mm, 0.82 0.31 mm, and 0.51 0.20 mm. raMPV mutants showed defects in cell-cell spread and/or viral growth, as judged by their plaque morphology. raMPV-G1700A replicated to a higher titer than wild-type raMPV. peak titer was 7.24 log10 PFU/ml, which was 1.1 logs higher than that of raMPV (6.10 log10 PFU/ml) there was no significant difference in replication kinetics between raMPV-N1701A and raMPV (P > 0.05) in 35-mm dishes were infected with each recombinant raMPV at an MOI of 0.1. cells were washed three times with fresh Opti-MEM containing 2% FBS. cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C for various time periods. rVSV carrying a point mutation in the MTase catalytic site abolished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation (29). rVSV carrying a point mutation in the MTase catalytic site (rVSV-K1651A) specifically abolished both G-N-7 but not 2\u2032-O methylation (28). ccpm was normalized by virus-specific mRNA. raMPV mRNAs were not methylated by vaccinia virus G-N-7 MTase. mRNAs of rVSV-K1651A and -G1670A were efficiently methylated by vaccinia virus. rhMPV-G1696A, -G1700A, -N1701A, and -D1755A are not defective in G-N-7 methylation. a total of 500 ng of mRNAs was isolated from aMPV- or VSV-infected cells and trans-methylated by vaccinia virus G-N-7 MTase in the presence of 15 Ci of [3H]SAM. raMPV and rVSV mutants were incubated with 10 units of vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase (VP39) after the methylation reaction, RNA was purified. the level of 2\u2032-O methylation was measured by 3H incorporation using a scintillation counter. raMPV mRNAs were not methylated by vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O MTase. rVSV-G1670A is not defective in 2\u2032-O methylation. raMPVs carrying mutations in the SAM binding site were specifically defective in 2\u2032-O, but not G-N-7, methylation. two major conclusions can be drawn from the above-described experiments. postinoculation and inoculuma Clinical signs (n = 3)c Virus replication in:b Sinus (n = 3) Trachea (n = 3) Lung (n = 3) No. of infected animals Viral titer (log10 TCID50/ml) Viral RNA (log10 GRC/ml)e No. of infected animals Viral titer (log10 TCID50/ml) Viral RNA ( 0.00 6.85 0.25 A 0 ND 6.24 0.13 A G1696A 0 0 ND 4.68 1.06 B 0 ND 4.48 0.05 B 0 ND 4.99 1.24 B G1700A 0 0 ND 5.87 2.09 B 0 ND 5.37 1.72 B N1701A 0 0 ND 4.14 0.46 C 0 ND 3.84 0.33 C 0 ND 4.78 0.70 B D1755A 0 0 turkeys were inoculated intranasally with DMEM as a control or with 2 105 TCID50 of raMPV-CO. at days 3, 5, 7, and 10 postinoculation, three animals in each group were euthanized for viral isolation. all 3 turkeys infected with raMPV-CO had a high titer of infectious virus. virus titers in sinus and trachea swabs were 4.75 and 5.25 log10 TCID50/ml. the virus titer was significantly less than that in the raMPV group. turkeys in all raMPV mutant-infected groups had no detectable virus. raMPV-G1696A and -G1700A were moderately (1.2-log defects) attenuated in virus replication. raMPV-N1701A and -D1755A were highly (more than 3-log defects) attenuated in virus replication. trachea and lung samples of each turkey were amplified by RT-PCR. no additional mutations were found in the genome except for the desired mutation in the MTase region of the L gene. raMPV mutants remained genetically stable in turkeys.

APMV-1, also known as Newcastle disease virus, is responsible for one of the most disastrous diseases in birds. aMPV is in the genus Metapneumovirus in the subfamily Pneumovirinae. a gene deletion mutant has been proposed to attenuate the aMPV. however, deletion of individual nonessential genes in aMPV virus severely impaired antibody response, protection, and immunogenicity. we hypothesize that the viral mRNA cap MTase is an excellent target to rationally attenuate aMPV for the development of live vaccines. failure to detect infectious virus in lungs may be due to variations in environmental factors (such as humidity), tissue homogenization methods, inhibitors in lung tissues, or the sensitivity of the TCID50 assay. however, the levels of viral genomic RNA in lungs from MTase-defective raMPV groups were significantly lower than those from the raMPV group. raMPV-G1700A, -N1701A, and -G1696A mutants grew to higher than or similar titers as the wild-type aMPV. the concept of using MTase as a target to generate live attenuated vaccine has been recently documented in several other RNA viruses. a single vaccination of 2\u2032-O MTase-defective japan encephalitis virus (JEV), another flavi this was the first demonstration that 2\u2032-O MTase-defective viruses are safe and immunogenic in a natural host of a virus. this finding will facilitate the commercialization of MTase-defective live vaccine candidates in the future. abolishing G-N-7 methylation will inhibit the efficiency of viral protein translation, which in turn diminishes viral replication. IFN by 2\u2032-O MTase coronaviruses was dependent on the cytosolic innate immune receptor MDA5 (34) on the other hand, 2\u2032-O MTase-defective WNV, MHV, and vaccinia virus were more sensitive to antiviral inhibition by IFN-inducible protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFITs) mutations to the MTase catalytic site abolished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation. however, mutations in the SAM binding sites either diminished both G-N-7 and 2\u2032-O methylation or specifically abolished G-N-7 methylation (29). rVSV-G1670A and -G1672A were specifically defective in G-N-7, but not 2\u2032-O, methylation. raMPVs defective in 2\u2032-O methylation were sufficiently attenuated while retaining high immunogenicity in turkeys, the natural hosts of aMPV. this novel approach can potentially be used for other avian and human paramyxoviruses for vaccine purposes."}
