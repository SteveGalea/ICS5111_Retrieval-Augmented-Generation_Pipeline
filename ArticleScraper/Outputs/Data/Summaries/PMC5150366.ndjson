{"summary": "results and Discussion 5\u2032 monophosphate of long dsRNA substrates is important for length Fidelity in siRNA production in Vitro. we first asked whether the length fidelity in siRNA production is affected if a long dsRNA substrate lacks a 5\u2032 monophosphate. we analyzed the length of the first, second, and third siRNAs (counting from the dsRNA end) produced by recombinant wild-type Dicer-2 protein the fidelity in the second and third siRNA production was high in both the initial 5\u2032 monophosphate 73-bp dsRNA substrate and the initial 5\u2032 hydroxyl 73-bp dsRNA substrate. the ratios of 21-nt siRNA in the second and third siRNA production were 96 2% and 91 1%, respectively, from the 5\u2032 hydroxyl 73-bp dRNA. we created transgenic flies expressing point mutants of Dicer-2 in vivo. the phosphate-binding pocket is disrupted by the phosphate-binding pocket. the amino acid residue corresponding to Arg943 is highly conserved as a basic residue. helicase domain and RNaseIII-mut Dicer-2 cannot catalyze RNA cleavage in the RNaseIII active sites (1, 7, 19) we expressed the transgenic Dicer-2 constructs in flies under a UAST promoter using the ubiquitous Act5C\u2013Gal4 driver in the background of the endogenous dicer-2 null. the levels of white mRNA in all three Phos-mut flies were significantly higher compared with control and wild-type Dicer-2 rescue flies. the levels of white mRNA in all three Phos-mut flies were significantly higher compared with the control and wild-type Dicer-2 rescue flies but lower compared with dicer-2null, ATP-mut, and RNaseIII-mut flies. ATP-mut Dicer (Dicer-2G31R) retains the activity to transfer siRNAs to Argonaute2. it cannot generate siRNAs from long dsRNAs (1, 7, 19, 23) levels of white mRNA in the background of endogenous ATP-mut dicer-2 (dicer-2G31R) were still higher compared with the control and wild-type Dicer-2 rescue flies but lower compared with the nonrescue flies. the quantity and/or quality of the siRNAs produced by Phos-mut Dicer-2 are reduced. the wIR-derived 19\u201323-nt siRNAs were observed in the control flies. the abundance was rescued in the flies containing the wild-type Dicer-2 transgene but not in ATP-mut or RNaseIII-mut Dicer-2 transgenic flies. pin wIR mapping reads, 18\u201323 nt Transposon mapping reads, 18\u201323 nt wIR; dicer-2[null], Act5C-Gal4/CyO; + 23,547,141 683,361 17,157,315 19,165,412 2,008,097 18,290,900 1,133,585 940,827 229,761 wIR; dicer-2[null], Act5C-G phosphate-binding pocket of Dicer-2 is important for high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production in vivo. phosphate-binding pocket of Dicer-2 is important for high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production in vivo. most of the wIR-derived siRNAs were 21 nt, composing 78% of all of the wIR-derived reads. the ratio of the 21-nt wIR-derived siRNAs was reduced (58%, 58%, and 51% for Phos-mut1, -2, and -3, respectively) the abundance of the 21-nt wIR-derived siRNAs with each specific length was altered in all three Phos-mut flies. the resultant increase in the length heterogeneity of siRNAs likely caused the partial loss of the RNA silencing activity in Phos-mut flies. we concluded that the phosphate-binding pocket in the Dicer-2 PAZ domain is important for the length fidelity, but not the efficiency, in siRNA production in vivo. ATP-mut Dicer-2 exhibited reduced cleavage activities for the long dsRNAs but retained the wild-type activities to cleave the short dsRNAs. these results support a previously proposed model that ATP binding and hydrolysis by the Dicer-2 helicase domain is necessary for Dicer-2 to translocate on a long dsRNA substrate to processively produce siRNAs. cleavage rates to wild-type Dicer-2 compared with wild-type Dicer-2. phosphate-binding pocket mutants lost the activity to cleave the short dsRNAs. the phosphate-binding pocket is not required for the efficiency to process long dsRNAs. seventy-six percent of siRNAs produced by wild-type Dicer-2 were 21 nt long. however, only 63%, 55%, and 58% of siRNAs produced by wild-type Dicer-2 were 21 nt long. mutations in the phosphate-binding pocket mimic the fidelity-lowering effect caused by the lack of the terminal monophosphate on long dsRNA observed in the first siRNA production by the wild-type Dicer-2. t 104-bp dsRNA mapping reads, 23 nt 104-bp dsRNA mapping reads, 25 nt 104-bp dsRNA mapping reads, 26 nt 104,bp dsRNA mapping reads, 27 nt 104,bp dsRNA mapping reads, 28 nt 104,bp dsRNA mapping reads, 29 nt 104-bp dsRNA the phosphate-binding pocket in the Dicer-2 PAZ domain plays an important and direct role in high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production. in vivo and in vitro studies revealed that the phosphate-binding pocket plays an important and direct role in high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production from the terminus in vitro. dicer-2 repeatedly uses the 5\u2032 monophosphate-anchoring mechanism to produce 21-nt siRNAs with high fidelity as it translocates along the length of the dsRNA. when a long dsRNA substrate lacks a 5\u2032 monophosphate, a siRNA with a wrong length is produced from the RNA terminus. the end of the substrate RNA cannot be properly anchored due to the lack of a 5\u2032 monophosphate. the phosphate-binding pocket mutant Dicer-2 produces siRNAs with altered length across the whole length of the RNA substrates without major loss in siRNA production efficiency. this model aligns well with the previous structural model of Dicer-2 (25) Drosophila Dicer-2 can cleave the terminal end of long dsRNA substrates lacking a 5\u2032 monophosphate. the initial terminal siRNAs produced may have a lower length fidelity due to the lack of a 5\u2032 monophosphate. this antiviral and antitransposon defense system mediated by the unique Dicer-2 enzyme is crucial in arthropods, as they lack acquired immunity. fidelity in first siRNA production from 73-bp dsRNA with a 5\u2032 hydroxyl was high. ratios of 20-, 21-, and 22-nt siRNAs were 6 1%, 85 1%, and 9 1%, respectively. dicer-2 cleavage leaves a 5\u2032 monophosphate on both siRNA duplex and the remaining long dsRNA. if a long dsRNA substrate lacks a 5\u2032 monophosphate, the length heterogeneity of the first siRNA is increased. the fidelity in only the first siRNA production is recovered in the subsequent processive siRNA production. compound protein of Phos-mut1 Dicer-2 processes long dsRNAs as efficiently as wild-type Dicer-2 but cannot process short dsRNAs. in Phos-mut2, three additional basic residues were conserved in Drosophila near the basic residues comprising the phosphate-binding pocket in the human Dicer PAZ domain were mutated to alanine residues. wIR produces an inverted repeat hairpin RNA corresponding to white exon 3 during eye development. Dicer-2 processes the wIR hairpin into siRNAs, which in turn cleaves and reduces the levels of endogenous white mRNAs. levels of white mRNA in dicer-2null flies were significantly higher compared with control flies that have endogenous wild-type dicer-2. phosphate-binding pocket of Dicer-2 is important for efficient RNA silencing in vivo. levels of white mRNA in the heads of the female flies are normalized by rp49 relative to the mean of the control flies. the levels of white mRNA in the Phos-mut flies were still higher compared with the control and wild-type Dicer-2 rescue flies but lower compared with the nonrescue, ATP-mut, and RNaseIII-mut flies. these results suggest that the partial loss of the RNA silencing activity in Phos-mut Dicer-2 transgenic flies is likely due to a reduction in quantity and/or quality of the siRNAs produced by Phos-mut the wIR-derived 19\u201323-nt siRNAs were observed in control flies. their abundance was reduced in dicer-2null flies, as expected. the abundance was rescued in the flies containing the wild-type Dicer-2 transgene but not in ATP-mut or RNaseIII-mut Dicer-2 transgenic flies. dicer-2[null], Act5C-Gal4/dicer-2[null]/+ 53,337,727 789,604 40,850,471 45,729,007 4,878,536 43,610,530 2,760,059 2,117,529 540,671 wIR;

dicer-2[null], Act5C-Gal4/dicer-2[null]. a phosphate-binding pocket of Dicer-2 is important for high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production in vitro. wild-type Dicer-2 efficiently processed both the 5\u2032 monophosphate- and 5\u2032 hydroxyl-long (104-bp) dsRNAs. the 5\u2032 monophosphate is required for efficient cleavage of short dsRNAs. as long dsRNA, 104-bp dsRNAs with 2-nt 3\u2032 overhang and either 5\u2032 monophosphate or 5\u2032 hydroxyl were tested. other end of the 30-bp dsRNAs was blocked by two deoxynucleotides (7). binding pocket mutants lost the activity to cleave the short dsRNAs. these results suggest that a longer duplex associates with Dicer-2 in a manner that is less dependent on the terminal phosphate recognition by the Dicer-2 phosphate-binding pocket. mutations in the phosphate-binding pocket mimic the fidelity-lowering effect caused by the lack of the terminal monophosphate on long dsRNA observed in the first siRNA production by the wild-type Dicer-2. mutations in the phosphate-binding pocket mimic the fidelity-lowering effect caused by the lack of the terminal monophosphate on long dsRNA. 16,606 Phos-mut1, R943A, R956A 17,765,860 14,324,866 1,030,312 1,012,335 1,901,386 9,023,960 982,391 126,670 63,415 56,022 45,241 29,125 21,769 18,172 14,068 Phos-mut2, H743A, R752A, R759A, R943A, R956A 19,327,74 104,bp dsRNA mapping reads, 26 nt 104,bp dsRNA mapping reads, 27 nt 104,bp dsRNA mapping reads, 29 nt 104-bp dsRNA mapping reads, 30 nt Wild type 16,469,750 13,780,908 638,794 574,670 971,076 10,442,217 831,088 97,147 48,67 the phosphate-binding pocket in the Dicer-2 PAZ domain plays an important and direct role in high-fidelity 21-nt siRNA production from the terminus in vitro. this in vivo finding is consistent with previous in vitro studies that showed that synthetic 21-nt siRNA duplexes are significantly more potent than synthetic 20-nt or 22-nt siRNA duplexes. a long dsRNA substrate lacks a 5\u2032 monophosphate, a siRNA with a wrong length is produced from the RNA terminus. the end of the substrate RNA cannot be properly anchored due to the lack of a 5\u2032 monophosphate. the N-terminal helicase domain and/or the dsRBD can still bind and align the long dsRNA to the RNaseIII active sites. the phosphate-binding pocket in the Dicer-2 PAZ domain anchors the 5\u2032 monophosphate of long dsRNA for precise measurement of 21-nt length between the 5\u2032 monophosphate and the RNaseIII active sites. the recognition of the 5\u2032 monophosphate of pre-miRNAs by the phosphate-binding pocket in the human Dicer PAZ domain was shown to be important for both the efficiency and length fidelity in miRNA production. initial terminal cleavage by Dicer-2 of such long dsRNA substrates lacking a 5\u2032 monophosphate can produce a 5\u2032 monophosphate on the remaining intermediate long dsRNA substrates. thus, the unique phosphate-binding pocket of Drosophila Dicer-2 can achieve both the high fidelity in siRNA production and the relaxed end structure requirement in the initial long dsRNA substrate cleavage. small RNA libraries were prepared, sequenced on Hiseq4000 (Illumina) and analyzed as previously described (19, 30\u201332). the sequencing statistics of the small RNAs are summarized in Tables S1 and S2. qPCR was performed using an oligo-dT primer and AMV Reverse Transcriptase (NEB) the primers used were white, 5\u2032-GTGGCCAATGTCAACGTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GAGGTATACTGGCACCGAGC-3\u2032;
