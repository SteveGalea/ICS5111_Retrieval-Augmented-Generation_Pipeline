{"summary": "proposed method consists of the signal transducer, CHA amplification and DNAzyme signal readout steps. the target T0 (in red) is the part of lytA gene of S. pneumoniae. the signal transducer H0 is generated by extending the 3\u2019-end of domain b and c to form a hairpin loop where domain b* of H0 is occluded by domain b. the signal transducer and CHA-based circuit for detecting the lytA gene of S. pneumonia were performed to prove feasibility of the proposed method. after incubation with hemin for 40 min, the absorbance of different mixtures was recorded. solutions under different conditions: (a) H1; (b) H1+H2; (c) H0+H1+H2; (d) T0+H0+H1+H2; and (e) T0+H0+H1+H2. the mixture of H0 and H1 did not cause their self-hybridization reaction (lane 4), neither did the mixture of H1 and H2 (lane 5). the maximum value of signal-to-noise ratio was achieved at the H0 concentration of 100 nM (Fig. 3A) the concentration of H1 was also critical parameter affecting the analytical performance. the error bars were standard deviations of three parallel experiments. the inset showed the color variation of the reaction solution for the increasing amounts of T0. the linear curve of the absorbance intensity (Y) vs the logarithm of the T0 concentration (C) was fitted to a regression equation of Y = 0.1471 lg (C/pM) - 0.1498 (R2 = 0.9994). the detection limit was calculated to be 32 pM according to the responses of the blank tests plus 3 times the standard deviation. the error bars were standard deviations of six repetitive measurements. PCR products were detected using agarose gel electrophoresis. there was no target band of PCR products for S. pneumoniae less than 2.4 105 CFU mL1. the absorbance for one-base mismatched DNA and two bases mismatched DNA was only about 25.8% and 4.0% of that for perfect target. the non-complementary target DNA showed almost the same response as the blank solution, indicating high specificity and great potential for single nucleotide polymorphism analysis. clinical sample assay The potential application of the developed colorimetric biosensor was investigated for detection of S. pneumoniae in clinical samples. the assaying values of the proposed method were slightly larger than bacterial culture plating count. a large number of clinical samples will be applied to further verify the developed method. the three Salmonella Typhimurium were inoculated into PBS with different concentrations from 0 to 8 107 CFU mL1. Upon addition of Salmonella Typhimurium with increasing concentration, the intensity of absorbance increased successively. the proposed method possesses the potential as a pragmatic tool for Salmonella Typhimurium direct detection in real samples. transducer H0 is generated by extending the 3\u2019-end of domain b and c to form a hairpin loop where domain b* of H0 is occluded by domain b. the loop a* is the complementary sequence to 24 nt of lytA gene nucleic acid. compared with curve a, there was almost no change in the mixture of H1 and H2. the results showed that H0 can trigger weak interaction of H1 and H2 to form a small amount of self-assembly product. but in the presence of T0 and H2 the amplified signal was about 282% of that without H2. we also used native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to characterize the reaction process. the base number of H0 (lane 1), H1 (lane 2) and H2 (lane 3) derived from PAGE were in accordance with our design. effects of (A) H0 concentration on signal-to-noise ratio, (B) H1 concentration on signal-to-noise ratio, (C) dependence of H1/H2 on incubation time on the H1/H2 were investigated. time dependence of the T0-H0 catalyzed hairpin assembly was also investigated. Y = 0.1471 lg (C/pM) - 0.1498 (R2 = 0.9994) in the range of 50 pM\u2013200 nM. the detection limit was calculated to be 32 pM according to the responses of the blank tests plus 3 times the standard deviation. the developed colorimetric assay has good precision and acceptable reproducibility. no target band of PCR products for S. pneumoniae less than 2.4 105 CFU mL1 owing to low resolution of gel electrophoresis29. the denatured PCR products were also detected using the developed colorimetric biosensor. 7 strains of S. pneumoniae have similar high signal responses among all the bacteria tested. the signal responses of other bacteria show no difference to that of the blank solution. a large number of clinical samples will be applied to further verify the developed method. aptamer can be used in conjugation with catalyzed hairpin assembly for detection of non-nucleic acid analytes. the results indicate that the developed method possesses the potential as a pragmatic tool for Salmonella Typhimurium direct detection in real samples. the amplification strategy can be used for detection different targets by changing the complementary target DNA or aptamer strands. 50 L of H1 (500 nM) and 50 L of H2 (400 nM) was added the above mixture to give the final concentrations of 125 nM and 100 nM. and further incubation in TNaK buffer for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C. 3 M of hemin was introduced to resulted solution and incubated for 40 min at room temperature. the mixture was added into square quartz cuvettes. the absorption spectra were collected from 500 to 400 nm. the rate of the peroxidase-mimicking reaction was monitored at 418 nm."}
