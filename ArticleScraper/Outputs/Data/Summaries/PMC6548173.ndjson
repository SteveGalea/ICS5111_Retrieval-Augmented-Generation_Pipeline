{"summary": "IL-35 is a dimeric protein consisting of p35 of IL12 and Epstein-Barr virus induced 3 (EBI3) subunits which are encoded by P35 and EBI3, respectively 1, 14-16. IL-35 is mostly expressed in Treg cells but recent evidences have uncovered its much larger tissue distribution 11. IL-12 p35, subunits of IL-35, in placental trophoblasts 19, Hodgkin lymphoma cells, acute myeloid leukemia cells, lung cancer cells 21 esophageal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, cervical carcinoma, and colorectal cancer 22, 23. the presence of Foxp3+ Treg cells and Treg cells in TME is demonstrated as one of the sources of IL-35 production 25, 26. IL-35 signaling in B cells is carried out via IL-12Rb2: WSX-1, which activates phosphorylation of STAT1 and STAT3 35. iTr35 has specific tolerance promoting capabilities in parasitic infections and tumors. IL-35 receptor consists of gp130 and IL-12R2 which upon activation phosphorylates STAT signaling. IL-35 suppresses the conventional T cells and promotes its conversion into iTr35 which plays vital role in tumor immune evasion. IL-35 is seen as critical immunosuppressive cytokine involved in immune evasion. the immune-cancer nexus is a well-established link as immune system plays a vital role in prevention, development and therapy of cancer 48. two types of plasmacytoma cells were injected into wild type mice. one consisted of tumor cells that were transfected with IL-35 to raise the amount of IL-35 into TME. another used normal plasmacytoma cells that produced very small amount of IL-35. 106 non-small cell lung cancer patients and 78 healthy controls found a positive correlation between tumor TNM stage, lymph node metastases and circulating levels of IL-35. the role of IL-35 in promotion and development of cancer is consolidated by Huang et al. same study held low circulating IL-23: IL-35 ratio responsible for poor prognosis of breast cancer 67. similar tumor promoting results showing direct or indirect involvement of IL-35 in colorectal cancer are also reported 69. IL-35 secreted IL-1 and IL-6 pathways in neutrophils. despite the growing evidence that directly implicates IL-35 for immune evasion of tumor cells, it is interesting to notice that majority of IL-35 is released from Treg cells. depletion of Tregs cells exerted similar effects on cancer development as IL-35 when studied alone 80. cytokine-induced killer cells are a heterogeneous cells population expressing cell markers for both T cells and natural killer cells. CIK have well reported advantages in hematological malignancies and solid tumors in the past 87-89. authors argued that IL-27 and IL-10 signaling play a vital role in the absence of IL-27 and IL-10 from Treg cells. it could mean superior effectiveness of Tregs depletion in tumor control as compared to IL-35 alone. IL-35 is a part of esophageal cancer TME as part of suppressive cytokine released directly from Treg cells. IL-17 102, 103 exerts anti-tumor actions by promoting immune cells into tumors, activating effector CD8(+) T cells, or directly through converting toward Th1 phenotype and producing IFN- 104. IL-35 inhibits the Th17 cells 38, but it is premature to jump to conclusion that it can also play a role in cancer immunity. effects of IL-35 in inhibiting cancer development, curtailing tumor growth and inducing the apoptosis in human cancer cells were reported by Long et al. in 2013 23. symphony of IL-35 effects on cancer is still in infancy. IL-35 can reduce acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) by expanding Tregs and repressing Th1 responses 118. rheumatoid arthritis 120-123 and liver inflammation in induced liver fibrosis in IL-12p35-/- mice has been observed. studies have implicated IL-35 in cancers, but its exact mechanism is still elusive. this review analyzed the array of studies on cancer since the inception of IL-35. it can be safely concluded that role of IL-35 in cancer is developing."}
