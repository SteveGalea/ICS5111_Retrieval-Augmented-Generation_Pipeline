{"summary": "lepidopteran baculoviruses synthesize two progeny phenotypes, the budded virus (BV) and occlusion-derived virus (ODV) occlusion bodies (OBs) offer some protection against environmental inactivating conditions such as UV light, heat and desiccation. the insect has 13\u201314 generations a year, causing damage all year round. it was isolated from dead Catopsilia pomona larvae in 1990. 78 baculoviruses have been fully sequenced. the 37 core genes (red), 23 lepidopteran baculovirus conserved genes (blue) and 10 Group I specific genes (green) are illustrated on the genome map. another 56 baculoviral genes and 4 hypothetical CapoNPV unique genes are shown in grey and open arrows. 79 sequenced baculoviruses tested with Maximum Likelihood method. it is tested by Bootstrap method with a value of 1000. numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap scores, only the value >50% are shown. a collinearly conserved region of lepidopteran baculoviruses was also found in CapoNPV between capo43 to capo75. it contains 20 core genes and five additional lepidopteran baculovirus conserved genes. it also includes two Group I specific genes, ac73 (capo69) and ac72 (capo70), and six other genes. the sequences of the 8 CapoNPV hrs are summarized in Figs 1 and 4 respectively. black background shows greater than 80% identity among compared regions. dark gray and light gray shows greater than 50% and 30% identity. ac53(capo87), ac78(capo64), ac81(capo61), desmoplakin(capo74), gp41(capo62), odv-ec27(capo14), odv-ec43(capo39), p18(capo52), p33(capo53), p40(capo45), p48/p45(capo43), p6.9( inase(capo114), djbp(capo89), egt(capo123), ptp(capo127), iap-1(capo110), iap-2(capo71), sod(capo107), trax-like(capo92), cath(capo113) ac105, ac30, ctl, fgf, gta, MTase, c57(capo83), ac59(capo82), ac72(capo70), ac73(capo69), ac87(capo68), ac87(capo58), ac91(capo54), capo105, capo76 * CapoNPV hypothetical unique genes (capo31, capo35, capo78 and capo106) are not included. notably absent from CapoNPV is a homologue to ac30. deletion of odv-e66 in AcMNPV did not affect the production of BmNPV. it is present in all previously identified Group I viruses, several Group II viruses and many betabaculoviruses. F-like protein is present in most alphabaculoviruses and betabaculoviruses. but it was not found in CapoNPV genome. GP64 functions as the envelope fusion protein of BV. sequence alignment was performed using clusterW method. predicted regions of furin cleavage site, fusion peptide, pre-TM and transmembrane domains are indicated below the alignment. black background shows greater than 80% identity among compared regions. orientation was designated as the zero point on the circular genome map. sixty-nine ORFs were in a clockwise direction and 61 in a counterclockwise direction with respect to the transcriptional orientation of polyhedrin. another 56 baculoviral genes and 4 hypothetical CapoNPV unique genes are shown in grey and open arrows. phylogenetic analysis was performed using amino acid sequence alignments of the combined 37 core genes from 79 sequenced baculoviruses. it is tested by Bootstrap method with a value of 1000. numbers at nodes indicate bootstrap scores, only the value is shown. a collinearly conserved region of lepidopteran baculoviruses was also found in CapoNPV between capo43 to capo75. it contains 20 core genes and five additional lepidopteran baculovirus conserved genes. it also includes two Group I specific genes, ac73 (capo69) and ac72 (capo70), and six other genes. gene content of CapoNPV contains 12 replication associated genes, 12 transcription associated genes, 8 genes essential for oral infection, 34 structure related genes and 15 auxiliary genes. rest are 45 of unknown function including 4 hypothetical unique genes of CapoNPV. exon0(capo17), ie-2(capo7), pe38(capo6) Structure 38k(capo48), 49k(capo16), ac53(capo87), ac78(capo64), ac81(capo61), desmoplakin(capo74), gp41(capo62), odv-ec27(capo14), odv-ec43(capo39), p18 ubiquitin(capo103) arif(capo118), bro-a(capo99), djbp(capo89), egt(capo123), gp37(capo77), ptp(capo127), iap-1(capo110), iap-2(capo71), sod(capo107), trax-like(capo92), ac105, ac30, ctl, fgf is one of the conserved proteins in vertebrates and invertebrates. it was previously found in all the lepidopteran baculoviruses except in maruca vitrata nucleopolyhedrovirus. notably absent from CapoNPV is a homologue to ac30. this gene seems to be nonessential because deletion thereof did not affect the production of BmNPV [28]. it is present in all previously identified Group I viruses, several Group II viruses and many betabaculoviruses. deletion of odv-e66 in AcMNPV increased oral infection dose about 1000 times while did not change the infectivity of BV. odv-e66 is present in most alphabaculoviruses and betabaculoviruses, however, it was not found in CapoNPV genome. notably absent from CapoNPV is a homologue to ac30. deletion of odv-e66 in AcMNPV did not affect the production of BmNPV. it is present in all previously identified Group I viruses, several Group II viruses and many betabaculoviruses. F-like protein is present in most alphabaculoviruses and betabaculoviruses. but it was not found in CapoNPV genome. GP64 functions as the envelope fusion protein of BV. the figure of SeMNPV F protein was adapted from a previous publication. the predicted regions of furin cleavage site, fusion peptide, pre-TM and transmembrane domains are indicated below the alignment. black background shows greater than 80% identity among compared regions, dark gray and light gray shows greater than 50% and 30% identity, respectively. putative ORFs potentially encoding more than 50 amino acids were designated as putative genes with minimal overlaps. phylogenetic analysis A phylogenetic tree was generated based on amino acid sequences encoded by the 37 core genes from CapoNPV. the genome of CapoNPV was sequenced with the Roche 454 GS FLX+ system by using a shotgun strategy. the complete genome sequence and annotation information were submitted to GenBank (accession number: KU565883). putative ORFs potentially encoding more than 50 amino acids were designated as putative genes with minimal overlaps. the genome annotation of CapoNPV.
