{"summary": "PPV characterized as a member of the autonomous parvoviruses is one of main pathogens that could cause reproductive failure in pregnant sows. PPV has been linked to interstitial nephritis in slaughter aged pigs [3], skin lesion occurrence in piglets [4], and nonsuppurative myocarditis in lactating piglets. some CHMs or CHMIs were isolated from Isatis indigotica Fort., angelica sinensis (Olive.) Diels, and astragalus membranaceus (Fisch.) have been developed into antiviral or antibacterial agents. on the other hand, CHMs or CHMIs possess many biological activities, such as inhibiting viral processes. propolis flavone (PF), a kind of ingredient extracted from propolis, has been used in chickens vaccinated with activated or inactivated vaccine. many studies proved that PF could improve the immune-enhancing activity in the cellular and humoral immune response. PF was processed to nanometer PF (NPF) by nanotechnology. yltetrazolium bromide was dissolved into 5 mgmL1 with calcium and magnesium-free phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2). DMSO was the product from Chemical Reagent Ltd of Shanghai Lingfeng. reagents were filtered through a 0.22 m millipore membrane filter. PK-15 grew into monolayer in 96-well plates. the series of concentrations NPF and PF at 2000, 1000, 500, 250, 125, 62.5, 31.2, 15.6, 7.8, and 3.9 gmL1 were added into the plates. each well of absorbance at 570 nm (A 570 value is correlation to the live cells number) PPV solution was added into PK-15 cell plate, 100 L/well, and six wells per concentration. cells were washed twice with Hanks' solution and then PPV solution was added. PPV content in PK-15 cell was determined by the MTT assay. the guinea pigs were raised in 80 cm 50 cm 40 cm wire cages. they were illuminated for 24 h receiving water and feeding ad libitum. hemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody against PPV of guinea pigs is zero before the experiment. dilutions ranged from 1 : 2 to 1 : 2048. serum-antigen mixture was inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. 50 microlitres of 1% rooster erythrocytes suspension was joined into each well. negative serum, positive serum, antigens, and erythrocytes included. PPV Content Determination Viral genomic DNA was extracted from the tissue of challenged guinea pigs using RNA/DNA Extraction Kit Ver. 3.0 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) according to the protocol of manufacturer. RTFR PCR assays conditions were the same as standard plasmid template preparation described [15]. dimethyl sulfoxide was produced by Zhengxing Chemical Co. Ltd. (Suzhou, China) DMSO was the product from Chemical Reagent Ltd of Shanghai Lingfeng. the diameters of the NPF determined by transmission electron microscopy were in ideal agreement with the particle sizes determined [13]. the design of Experiment In Vitro 2.3.1. PPV solution was added into PK-15 cell plate, 100 L/well, and six wells per concentration. cells were washed twice with Hanks' solution and then PPV solution was added.

PPV solution was added into PK-15 cell plate after being incubated for 2 h. cells were washed twice with Hanks' solution and then PPV solution was added. all PK-15 cell plates were placed into 5% CO2 incubator at 37.5\u00b0C. antiviral Experiment 320 guinea pigs were divided into 8 groups randomly. guinea pigs in six drug groups were challenged with 0.5 mL of PPV. challenged dosage was 4.5 log2 titers of median tissue culture infective dose mL1. the serum-antigen mixture was inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 min. 50 microlitres of 1% rooster erythrocytes suspension was joined into each well and reincubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. a negative serum, a positive serum, antigens, and erythrocytes were also included. RNA/DNA Extraction Kit Ver. 3.0 (TaKaRa, Dalian, China) was performed to optimize the RTFR PCR protocol. optimization of each singleplex real-time PCR assay of PPV was essential for the subsequent PCR reaction. all RTFR PCR reactions were performed in triplicate. the guinea pigs in six groups and CC group were challenged with 0.5 mL of PPV. the challenged dosage was 4.5 log2 titers of median tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) mL1. the weight of guinea pigs in each group was also observed on day 21. a negative serum, a positive serum, antigens, and erythrocytes were also included. the highest serum dilution causing completely inhibition was regarded as the endpoint. the geometric mean titer was marked as reciprocal log2 values. total of tissue and serum samples tested for PPV by RTFR PCR and conventional PCR assays. the conventional RTFR PCR conditions were the same as the standard plasmid template preparation described [15]. significant difference was considered at P 0.05. the PK-15 cell A 570 values of NPF at 250\u201315.6 gmL1 concentration groups were significantly larger than those of the PPV control (P 0.05). the PK-15 cell A 570 values of NPF at 250\u201331.2 gmL1 groups were significantly larger than those of the PPV control (P 0.05). a\u2013fBars in the same mode marked without the same superscripts differ significantly and * in the same pattern differ significantly between NPF and PF (P 0.05).

IL-6 is secreted by type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) and able to coordinate humoral immunity. -IFN also is secreted by Th1 cells; it can reflect the basic status of cellular immunity and humoral immunity of organism to certain extent.
