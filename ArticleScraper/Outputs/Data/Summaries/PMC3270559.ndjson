{"summary": "all antihypertensive medications lower BP, but specific drug classes display effects beyond BP reduction (pleiotropic effects) that might contribute to cardiovascular risk reduction. chronic RAAS activation leads to hypertension and perpetuates a cascade of proinflammatory, prothrombotic, and atherogenic effects associated with end-organ damage. angiotensin-converting enzyme homologue, ACE2, added complexity to the main axis of the RAAS. ACE2 is a membrane-bound carboxypeptidase and its cellular and tissue distribution is different from that of ACE. ACE2 is expressed in the endothelium throughout the vasculature. ACE2 is distributed in tissues with the most abundant expression in heart, kidney, lung, small intestine, and testis [14]. ACE2 is the sheddase responsible for the ectodomain cleavage and shedding of ACE2. ACE2 is different from ACE in both substrate specificity and functions. in human heart tissue the main products of Ang I degradation are both Ang-(1\u20139) and Ang II generated by heart chymase, ACE and a poorly identified carboxypeptidase A [24] ACE2 does not act on bradykinin metabolism and its activity is not inhibited by classic ACEIs. ACE2 activity may counterbalance the effects of ACE by preventing the accumulation of Ang II in tissues where both ACE2 and ACE are expressed Ang-(1\u20137) has been shown to release vasopressin as effectively as Ang II from neurohypophyseal explants [28] and to have actions opposing those of Ang II. Ang-(1\u20137) binds to the Mas receptor (G protein-coupled receptor) which mediates vasodilating and antiproliferative actions of this peptide. AT1R and AT2R are members of the seven-transmembrane-domain G-protein-coupled receptors superfamily. the AT2R mediates most of the recognized actions of Ang II. the AT2R is expressed in adult tissues in smaller amounts than the AT1R. Ang-(1\u20139) is present in healthy volunteers, in patients or in animals treated with ACE inhibitors (ACEIs) or AT1 receptor blockers (ARBs) [50\u201352], and its circulating levels are increased by pathological conditions (i.e. early after MI) [51], however, very little is currently known about Ang-(1\u20139) biological effects. ang-(1\u20139) levels increased in plasma and kidney [50, 53]. this increase in Ang-(1\u20139) steady-state levels could be due to decreased catabolism of Ang-(1\u20139) by ACE. Conversely, increased levels of Ang-(1\u20139) could be due to increased production by ACE2. assays showed that Ang-(1\u20139) is able to bind the Ang II type 2 receptor (AT2R) despite having 100-fold lower affinity than Ang II for the AT2R [57], selective AT2R activity of Ang-(1\u20139) is not inconsistent with current pharmacological models of G protein-coupled receptor signalling and activation. Ang-(1\u20139) makes up part of the counter-regulatory arm of the RAS. preliminary studies indicate that the classical pathways via PKC translocation and ERK1/2 activation are not different. future studies will be required to establish these mechanisms. vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) expression of human ACE2 was confirmed by RT-PCR, real-time RT-PCR, and ACE2 activity assays. transgene ACE2 expression leads to significantly increased circulating levels of Ang-(1\u20137). arterial blood pressure was reduced in SHRSP-ACE2 compared to SHRSP rats. ACE2 degradates both Ang I to generate Ang-(1\u20139) and Ang II to generate Ang-(1\u20137). this would also influence the vasoconstrictive/proliferative effects of the ACE/Ang II/AT1R axis. ACE2 is a multifunctional enzyme with many biologically active substrates. ACE2 through Ang-(1\u20139) could act as a counterregulator of the first arm. increased plasma levels of Ang-(1\u20139) were observed in rats with myocardial infarction treated with the ACE inhibitor enalapril. fasudil reduced Ang II and increased Ang-(1\u20139) plasma levels. fasudil reduced Ang II and increased Ang-(1\u20139) plasma levels. no modifications were observed in Ang-(1\u20137) levels. vascular wall is continuously exposed to hemodynamic forces such as the luminal pressure and shear stress. changes in hemodynamic forces can modify vessel diameter. acute changes in hemodynamic forces can modify vessel diameter. ACE2 is expressed in human coronary arteries and arterioles and vasa vasorum of most organs. ACE2 localizes preferentially in endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells. ang-(1\u20137) infusion after balloon-catheter injury reduced neointima formation. there is known the prothrombotic effect of Ang II [96, 97] and the antithrombotic action of Ang-(1\u20137) [98] in renovascular hypertensive rats. the question arises whether Ang-(1\u20139) effects are similar to Ang II or to Ang-(1\u20137) in in vivo conditions. promote proteins TGF-1, PAI-1, MCP-1, and increased aortic NADPH oxidase activity and O2 production were reduced. this new effect of RhoA/Rho-kinase inhibition on ACE2 gene expression, enzymatic activity, and Ang-(1\u20139) levels might additionally contribute to its benefits in hypertension, atherosclerosis, and in cardiovascular and renal pathologic remodeling. Ang-(1\u20137)-Mas can hetero-oligomerize with AT1R, thereby inhibiting Ang II actions. the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20137)-Mas axis is now considered as a counter-regulatory system to the ACE-Ang II-AT1R axis. crackower et al. [64] originally reported a progressive reduction in LV contractile function in ACE2-null mice without significant changes in fibrosis, left ventricular and cardiac myocyte hypertrophy. ACE2 deletion exacerbated pressure overload-induced cardiac dysfunction and remodeling that was associated with increased intracardiac Ang II levels. ang-(1\u20139) levels were significantly increased when MI rats were treated with enalapril for 8 weeks. both drugs prevented LVH and increased plasma Ang-(1\u20139) levels by several folds. ang-(1\u20139) levels correlated negatively with different LVH markers. Ang-(1\u20139) and Ang-(1\u20137) were able to block hypertrophy induced by either agonist. Ang-(1\u20139) and Ang-(1\u20137) were not inhibited by captopril. ang-(1\u20137) activity was also inhibited in the presence of the bradykinin type 2 receptor antagonist HOE140, without affecting Ang-(1\u20139). ACE2/Ang-(1\u20139) axis is an effective, and possibly direct novel anticardiac hypertrophy axis. ACE2 expression and Ang-(1\u20139) levels are altered in diastolic and systolic dysfunction and remodeling. activation of the ACE2/Ang-(1\u20139) axis protects the heart and vessels from cardiovascular remodeling. the noncanonical RAS arm has new biological effector Ang-(1\u20139). solid arrows indicates activation broken arrows indicates inactivation."}
