{"summary": "EM-map representations with reduced number of points or with a set of 3D Gaussian functions (grains) have been shown useful in studying macromolecular structure and dynamics [30, 33\u201344]. EM-map representations with a reduced number of points or with a set of 3D Gaussian functions (grains) are sometimes referred to as coarse-graining of EM maps. symmetry is preserved in EM-map approximations with this strategy for typical values of the target approximation error such as 1\u201315% [30, 33, 42\u201344]. symmetry is preserved in spherical Gaussian functions of fixed standard deviation that we refer to as pseudoatoms. pseudoatoms have spherical shape and uniformed size over the molecule. they allow an easy setting of springs among neighboring grains in the ENM. on the contrary, 3D points (the so-called codebook vectors) obtained with VQ can be regarded as Gaussian functions whose standard deviation can vary over the molecule. ellipsoidal Gaussian distribution obtained with the GMM approach should be more complicated. EM maps can be approximated using Gaussian radial basis functions (RBFs) by f N r = i = 1 N i K r - r i. r i is the vector of the center coordinates of the ith pseudoatom. the approximation error e N satisfies e N = 1 / V j = 1 V f r j - f N r j / f. to avoid getting trapped into local minima of the error e N, new pseudoatoms are added progressively in regions with large errors and weights. Synthetic density map of 70S ribosome at 15 resolution from an atomic structure available in PDB (the structure from [55]) and its pseudoatomic representation using = 1.3 and = 4% (b) 3D Gaussian functions (referred to as pseudoatoms) are shown as spheres of a radius related to and overlapping spheres are used for a nicer visualization of the pseudoatomic structure. EM density maps can be used to obtain other possible conformational states of the same complex. the conformational states are discrete and can be regarded as discrete samples of a continuous trajectory of conformational transition. a displacement of pseudoatoms along normal modes has no units. EM density map of a DNA polymerase Pol -B subunit complex of the eukaryotic primosome from [59] (c) and a displacement of pseudoatoms along the normal mode describing the bending-unbending motion that has also been observed experimentally [57, 58] (b). in this figure, very small spheres are used to represent 3D Gaussian functions (referred to as pseudoatoms) not all spheres are shown in order to avoid their ation error e N satisfies e N = 1 / V j = 1 V f r j = 1 V f r j = 1 V f r j = 1 V f r j = 1 V f r j = 1 V f r j - f r j / f. Synthetic density map of 70S ribosome at 15 resolution from an atomic structure available in PDB (the structure from [55]) (a) and its pseudoatomic representation using = 1 and = 2% (b) in this figure, 3D Gaussian functions (referred to as pseudoatoms) are shown as spheres of a radius related to and overlapping spheres are used for a nicer visualization of the pseudoatomic structure. NMA of intermediate-resolution EM density maps is especially useful when atomic-resolution structures cannot be obtained [37, 38, 47] but it requires coarse-grain representations of the density maps. each node is connected, via harmonic springs, with other nodes within a sphere of a given radius (the radius is called interaction cutoff distance) EM density map of a DNA polymerase Pol -B subunit complex of the eukaryotic primosome from [59] (c) and a displacement of pseudoatoms along the normal mode describing the bending-unbending motion that has also been observed experimentally [30, 59] (b). in this figure, very small spheres are used to represent 3D Gaussian functions (referred to as pseudoatoms) not all spheres are shown in order to avoid their the server also contains precomputed results for several EM maps. coarse-grain representations of EM density maps and normal modes of those coarse-grain representations can be used to analyze experimental EM data. this space can be explored to detect whether the conformational change is discrete or continuous. along the trajectories, the given EM map and the obtained pseudoatomic structure can be animated and 3D reconstructions can be calculated. it has been shown that this methodology can help detect the motions undetectable with methods that assume a small number of different coexisting conformations in the specimen. the pseudoatomic representation of the reference density map is represented with points and the distance between the points correspond to the differences between the corresponding conformations. the displacement is shown by providing three frames of an animation represented by red, yellow, and blue isosurfaces of the density maps into which the reference pseudoatomic structure was converted during the displacement. it should be noted that the conformational variability shown in Figure 3(b) is rarely seen in EM because the majority of computational methods assume specimens with few different conformations of complexes analysis of conformational transitions by EM is currently a research field in expansion [29\u201332, 52], which will be reviewed in a separate publication. analysis of EM maps is currently a research field in expansion [29\u201332, 52], which will be reviewed in a separate publication. the actual conformation in each EM density map (reference map) is estimated by elastic fitting of this map with the pseudoatomic structures of all other maps from the given set of EM maps. the obtained maximum cross-correlation coefficients are subtracted from 1 and then mapped onto a low-dimensional space, which shows the differences (distances) among given EM density maps that cannot be interpreted using normal modes. we have shown that pseudoatom representations of EM density maps can be used for EM-map denoising. smaller target approximation errors (voxels) and smaller Gaussian standard deviations () generally produce better approximations of EM maps. setting or to higher values can reduce this risk. norovirus virus-like particle from [60] radially colored with Chimera before (a) and after (b) denoising. arbitrary slice before (c) and after (d) denoising for the density maps shown in (a) and (b) respectively. conformations actually present in EM data can be interpreted using simulated conformations. normal modes were used for image analysis first in [50], but the first procedure capable of automatically processing large series of images using as many \u201ctest\u201d conformations as needed is HEMNMA [30, 51] conformational changes may be identified by analyzing the most populated regions in this space. along the trajectories, the given EM map and the obtained pseudoatomic structure can be animated and 3D reconstructions can be calculated. it has been shown that this methodology can help detect the motions undetectable with methods that assume a small number of different coexisting conformations in the specimen. in

not be detected with ML3D. the displacement is shown by providing three frames of an animation represented by red, yellow, and blue isosurfaces of the density maps. analysis of continuous conformational transitions by EM is a research field in expansion [29\u201332, 52], which will be reviewed in a separate publication. the actual conformation in each EM density map (reference map) is estimated by elastic fitting of this map with the pseudoatomic. the obtained maximum cross-correlation coefficients are subtracted from 1 and then mapped onto a low-dimensional space. in some heterogeneity cases, such as a combined conformational and compositional heterogeneity of states along the elongation cycle of human 80S ribosome, this task can be particularity challenging. but StructMap can still help visualizing the differences between the states and analyzing potential trajectories. the image is assigned the orientation, translation, and normal mode amplitudes of the best-matching projection. the normal mode amplitudes obtained for all images are finally mapped onto a low-dimensional distance space (usually, 1D, 2D, or 3D) this space can be explored to detect whether the conformational change is discrete or continuous (absence of clusters, points spread over the space) HEMNMA can also analyze a series of images using an atomic-resolution structure instead of a density map. it should be noted that the conformational variability shown in Figure 3(b) is rarely seen in EM because the majority of computational methods assume specimens with few different conformations of complexes. analysis of continuous conformational transitions by EM is currently a research field in expansion [29\u201332, 52], which will be reviewed in a separate publication. analysis of continuous conformational transitions by EM is currently a research field in expansion [29\u201332, 52]. StructMap StructMap [33] automatically analyzes a set of EM density maps to map them onto a common low-dimensional distance space. it requires representing each density map with pseudoatoms and computing normal modes of each obtained pseudoatomic structure. the actual conformation in each EM density map (reference map) is estimated by elastic fitting of this map with the pseudoatomic structures of all other maps from the given set of EM maps. a few EM maps can be chosen from the distance space obtained by StructMap so as to explore more finely specific regions in this space. a large number of such images must be averaged in 3D space to reduce noise. however, even high-resolution EM maps may still contain significant amounts of noise. EM-map approximation is a weighted sum of Gaussian functions of given standard deviation and amplitude 1 (referred to as pseudoatoms) the shape and density distribution of a given macromolecular complex are thus fully represented with the distribution of Gaussian functions. the modified conformation, represented with the pseudoatoms, can be converted into a density. target approximation error control allows different applications of this method. target approximation errors smaller than 5% are recommended for EM maps of higher resolution. larger target approximation errors (5%\u201315%) are recommended for EM maps of lower resolution. we are currently working on a method based on pseudoatoms with a fixed Gaussian-function standard deviation. that approach makes calculations using class averages instead of raw images. that approach does not consider a possible conformational heterogeneity of the given set of images."}
