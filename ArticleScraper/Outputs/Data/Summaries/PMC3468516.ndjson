{"summary": "study was designed to assess the beneficial effects of post-treatment of oroxylin A (oroA) in ameliorating lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced lung inflammation and fatality. rats were injected with LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) to induce ALI. oroA was given (15 mg/kg, iv) 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. pathogenesis of ARDS involves release of proinflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- and nitric oxide (NO) [5]\u2013[7] among others. high level of TNF- production, an early warning signal, can aggravate lung injuries. post-treatment of these drugs does not significantly reduce lung injury [16], [17], and mortality due to ARDS remains high [18]. polyphenols which exhibit anti-inflammatory effects are major components in many traditional herbal remedies [19]. after LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) challenge was found. oroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr after LPS challenge prevented decrease. plasma TNF- was significantly elevated and peaked at the 1st hr. plasma TNF- was followed by rapid decline to basal level at the 8th hr. LPS treatment and red arrow OroA post-treatment. data represent meansSEM. *P0.05 indicates significant difference from the control. oro-A (15 mg/kg, iv) given 1 hr (panel Aiii and B) and 6 hrs (panel Avi) after saline (Sal) treatment did not show any effect when examined 24 hrs after LPS challenge. panel C indicates that the enhanced lung wet-to-dry weight (W/D) ratio following LPS treatment (10 mg/kg, iv) was reversed by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) treatment significantly increased the lung wet-to-dry (W/D) weight ratio. the increase was reduced significantly by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr and 6 hrs after LPS challenge. pulmonary edema formation assay was performed. the expression was significantly inhibited by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 6 hrs after LPS challenge. iNOS production examined 24 hrs after LPS challenge was significantly suppressed. the results are summarized as the relative density (%) of iNOS production. hr/Posttreat (post-treatment hour after LPS treatment); E/hr (examination hour after LPS challenge). data are meansSEM. hr/posttreat (post-treatment hour after LPS treatment); E/hr (examination hour after LPS challenge); data are means SEM. #P0.05 indicates significant difference from the normal control (Lane 1). LPS treatment caused significant phosphorylation of NF-Bp65. phosphorylated NF-Bp65 was significantly inhibited by Oro-A (15 mg/kg, iv) given 6 hrs after LPS challenge. reduction examined 24 hrs after LPS challenge (Fig. 6A) was reversed to similar extent. bar graphs summarized relative density of cytosolic NF-B protein that was normalized to actin. 6Ci indicates effects of LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) administered 6 hrs after LPS challenge. phosphorylated NF-B p65 cells were significantly reduced by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 6 hrs after LPS challenge. oro-A (60 mg/kg, ip) administered 1 hr (Panel A) or 6 hrs (Panel B) after LPS challenge. the decrease was prevented by Oro-A (60 mg/kg, ip) administered 1 hr (Panel A) or 6 hrs (Panel B) OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) was administered 1 hr and examined 24 hrs after LPS treatment (10 mg/kg, iv) normal saline (Sal) or Solvent (Solv, normal saline plus Tween 80 at 91 ratio) was administered as controls. n indicates the number of experiments. administration of OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) 1 hr after LPS challenge significantly reduced LPS-induced accumulation of activated alveolar macrophages. similar results were found when OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) was administered 6 hrs after LPS challenge. LPS (10 mg/kg, iv) significantly increased lung injury score compared to that of Sal (normal saline) control when examined 24 hrs (E/24h) after LPS challenge. the increase was reduced significantly by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. oroA reduced the Elevated Plasma NO and iNOS expression in the Lung Tissues of LPS-induced ALI plasma NO concentration was significantly increased after LPS administration (10 mg/kg, iv) the increase was significantly reduced by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. oroA was administered 1 hr (panel A) or 6 hrs (panel B) and examined 24 hrs (E/24h) after LPS challenge. data are meansSEM. *P0.05 indicates significant difference from the normal control. ALI HMGB1 released from nuclei into cytoplasmic region following LPS challenge. concentration of cytoplasmic HMGB1 was relatively low in control and non-LPS-treated lung tissues. elevated level at 24th hr was significantly reduced by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) OroA inhibition of LPS-induced NF-B Activation and IB Degradation in the Lung Tissues was mediated by inhibiting transcriptional factor NF-B activation and translocation. cytoplasmic IB decreased significantly (ie. enhanced degradation) in lung tissues compared to that in control group. challenge was prevented by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr (Lanes 3) or 6 hrs (Lane 5) after LPS challenge. relative density of cytosolic NF-B protein was normalized to actin. the increase examined 24 hrs after LPS challenge was significantly reversed to similar extent by treatment with OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr (Lane 3 in Fig. 6B) or 6 hrs (Lane 5 in Fig. 6B) after LPS challenge. oroA improved the survival rate of endotoxemic mice. LPS treatment (100 mg/kg, ip) significantly decreased survival rate. urethane-anesthetized rat model of ALI used in present study has its advantage that hemodynamic changes can be monitored continuously for 24 hrs. urethane at higher concentration (>1.1 g/kg, ip) exhibited anti-inflammatory effects and protected rats against lethal endotoxemia with reduced TNF- release. urethane at lower concentrations (0.1 and 0.5 g/kg, ip) did not suppress LPS-induced productions of the protective effect of OroA in urethane-anesthetized rats is not likely due to urethane at 0.5 g/kg (ip) urethane at 0.5 g/kg (ip) does not seem to work in an additive or synergistic fashion with OroA, thereby exaggerating the natural ability of the compound. significant lung injuries including edema formation, thickened intra-alveolar septa, and enhanced lung injury scores were reduced significantly by OroA (15 mg/kg, iv) administered 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS challenge. findings suggest that OroA is effective in the later phase of lung inflammation, during which more inflammatory cascades are activated. oA appeared to relieve edema by protecting endothelial function to alleviate neutrophil sequestration. vascular endothelial cell injury and increased vascular permeability in the lungs were prevented by intravenous OroA. the results provide additional evidence supporting that OroA exhibits potent anti-cytokine effects. oroA appears to possess multi-sites of action in the early and the later phases of endotoxemia. this may decrease the subsequent release of cytokines and development of irreversible damages such as due to release of HMGB1. 80% of mice died between 24 and 48 hrs after receiving the lethal dose of LPS. the fatality of mice was significantly reduced after animals were given oroA (60 mg/kg, ip) 1 hr or 6 hrs after LPS. corticosteroids are not clinically effective when administered at the later phase of lung injury. oroA amelioration of LPS-induced ALI involved inhibition of activated NF-B and blockade of release of early and late-acting cytokines. cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) is known to play a role in lung inflammation. ivSal, 1h or 6 h/iv/Solv
