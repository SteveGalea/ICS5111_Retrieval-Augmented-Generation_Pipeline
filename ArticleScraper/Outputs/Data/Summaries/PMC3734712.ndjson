{"summary": "the study was designed for acute (single dose - 14 days), sub-chronic (repeat dose - 28 days) and chronic (intended clinical dose - 120 days) toxicity tests using three dose levels, viz. therapeutic, average (2x therapeutic dose) and highest dose (10 x therapeutic dose) exposure in Rhesus monkeys. the information generated by this study draws attention to the need for national and international regulatory agencies in formulating guidelines for pre-clinical safety evaluation of biotech products. DRV was dissolved in saline and stored at -20\u00b0 C. a total of 46 (24 M + 22 F) monkeys (M. mulatta), aged 2 yr, were obtained from national centre for laboratory animal sciences (NCLAS), NIN, Hyderabad, India. they were housed in individual cages in conventional animal facilities of NCLAS, a registered facility with Committee for the Purpose of Control and Supervision of Experimentation on Animals (CPCSEA) pre-study acute toxicity test was conducted by administration of single dose of DRV test formulation containing ten times the intended clinical dose (10X) in two female monkeys. morbidity, mortality, abnormal behaviour and toxic reactions, if any, were observed for 14 days after exposure. blood samples from femoral vein were drawn into vacutainer tubes using disposable 21 gauge needle on days 0, 15, 30, 90 and 120 post-exposure. blood samples from femoral vein were drawn into vacutainer tubes using disposable 21 gauge needle on days 0, 15, 30, 90 and 120 post-exposure. urine samples were tested qualitatively for various parameters on days 30, 60 and 90 post-exposure. the haematology profile included total white blood cell (WBC) count, red blood cell (RBC) count, haemoglobin (Hb), haematocrit (HCT), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC), platelet count, mean platelet volume (MPV) and differential leucocytes count. individual organs examined for gross changes in morphology after removal. brain, spinal cord, sciatic nerve, thymus, aorta, heart, thyroid, trachea, lungs, liver, spleen, adrenals, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, pancreas, individual sex organs, injection site at hind limb thigh. ed DNA antibodies (ds DNA-Ab) were detected by purified antigen in serum samples of all monkeys (N=24) before and after 90th and 120th day of vaccine exposure. ANA was tested in the tissue samples at the site of injection, liver, heart, brain, kidney and spleen. anti-double stranded DNA antibodies (ds-DNA Ab) were analysed. samples were scored as positive, if a 1.68 kb band was present. tests were carried out according to manufacture instructions of kits. blood samples from femoral vein were drawn into vacutainer tubes using disposable 21 gauge needle on days 0, 15, 30, 90 and 120 post-exposure. the detailed clinical chemistry profile included plasma glucose, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, total protein, albumin, total bilirubin, calcium, inorganic phosphorus. fifty per cent of the monkeys in sub-chronic (30 days) and thirty per cent of the chronic group (i.e. days 90 and 120) were fasted overnight (water allowed) and euthanised. an in situ examination of organs was done and any fluid presence was looked into. the bone marrow was removed from the upper end of femur, suspended in 3.8 per cent sodium citrate and stained with Leishman's stain as per standard procedures. in Tier I, evidence of any immune mediated hyperactivity or immune suppression was assessed in the form of reactive hyperplasia/hypoplasia. 1 mg of tissue DNA, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 1 mg of each primer, 10X Taq DNA polymerase buffer and 2.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase. PCR products were analyzed on 1 per cent agarose gels and the DNA was visualized by ethidium bromide staining. samples were scored as positive, if a 1.68 kb band was present. the monkeys, investigated after administration of DRV and CRV at various dose levels did not show any significant changes in body weight gain or food intake. the haematological (Table II) and biochemical parameters on days 15 and 30 post exposure were found to be within normal range. plasmid DNA was detectable at the site of injection (DRV 10X) in only one animal, while all other tissues of the same animal were negative for the presence of residual plasmid DNA. the results indicated that all serum samples (post exposure 90 and 120 days) tested were negative for anti-ds DNA antibodies and anti-nuclear-antibodies. no observational Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL) of DRV is 1000 g/dose (10 times of therapeutic dose) if administered on 0, 4, 7, 14, 28th day. histologically, there was mild hyperplasia in spleen, reactive hyperplasia/sinus histiocytosis in lymph nodes (lymphoid aggregates in stomach) and lymphoid hyperplasia in small and large intestine. plasmid DNA was detectable at the site of injection (DRV 10X) in only one animal, while all other tissues of the same animal were negative. no observational Adverse Effects Level (NOAEL) of DRV is 1000 g/dose (10 times of therapeutic dose) if administered on 0, 4, 7, 14, 28th day. 40,000 people die of rabies each year and a majority of them are from developing countries4. ly relevant animal species for testing safety and toxicity of novel monoclonal antibody therapies to support clinical testing can be challenging. in the present investigation we selected Rhesus monkey (non-human primate) as non-rodent species. the efficacy of the vaccine has been confirmed earlier in the same species6. pre-clinical safety testing of DNA vaccines involves selection of the appropriate species. in Tier-I tests, the total and differential blood cell counts, serum protein, albumin, organ weights, body weights were found to be normal in monkeys exposed to highest dose of different test compounds. we observed no changes in spleen, thymus, lymph nodes and bone marrow. the sensitivity of the method is to determine the presence of residual plasmid DNA at the site of injection of one female monkey exposed to 10X DRV. the presence of residual DNA at this concentration is unlikely to integrate into the host genome. this data add information to the existing data on evaluation of DNA products to be used as preventive/therapeutic agents in clinical conditions."}
