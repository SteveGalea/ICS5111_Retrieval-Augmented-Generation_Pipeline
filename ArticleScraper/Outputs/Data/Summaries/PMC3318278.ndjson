{"summary": "PRRSV is a widely disseminated virus of swine that causes interstitial pneumonia and abortions and late-term fetal death in sows. infection with PRRSV is characterized by prolonged viral persistence. current vaccines fail to provide disease control, especially against genetically unrelated strains. type I interferons, such as IFN- and IFN-, contribute to innate antiviral immunity by promoting production of antiviral mediators. they also play a role in the adaptive immune response by inducing both the maturation of dendritic cells into professional antigen-presenting cells. IFN- plays a role in the development of the adaptive immune response to PRRSV. we followed aspects of the adaptive immune response, both antibody- and cell-mediated immunity, in pigs simultaneously administered Ad5\u2013pIFN- and PRRSV. we compared them to the response in pigs exposed only to PRRSV. the other five pigs from each group were euthanized 56 days after challenge with PRRSV. viremia was measured by both virus isolation and real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) eight microliters of the eluted RNA sample was then used with a one-step RT-PCR kit. results are expressed as the amount of vRNA relative to the standard curve. ELISA sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios were determined by an ELISA kit. 96-well membrane plates were prewetted with 35% ethanol, washed, and coated overnight at 4\u00b0C with 6 g/ml anti-pIFN- (P2G10; BD Biosciences) the next day, the plate was washed and blocked with complete RPMI (RPMI 1640, 10% fetal bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% antibiotic/antimycotic [Invitrogen] and genta the average of duplicate wells for each sample was used for statistical analysis. Viremia, ELISpot assay, and antibody response data were analyzed. comparisons between treatment groups were made at each time point using a 5% level of significance (P 0.05) the pigs in group 1 were mock challenged with medium from noninfected cell cultures. four to five pigs from each group were euthanized 14 days after challenge with PRRSV. the other five pigs from each group were euthanized 56 days after challenge. a real-time RT-PCR assay for PRRSV was used to quantify viral RNA (vRNA) in the serum of pigs. eight microliters of the eluted RNA sample was then used with a one-step RT-PCR kit (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's recommendations. PBMCs were washed once with RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen), passed through a 40-m-pore-size screen filter, washed a second time, and enumerated. an enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay for IFN--secreting cells was performed as previously described with slight modifications (42). the number of PBMC samples analyzed for each treatment group ranged from 4 to 5. the cell-free BALF was tested for levels of IL-1, IL-8, IL-6, TNF-, IL-2, IL-4, IL-12p70, IFN-, and IL-10. IFN- levels in the pigs given Ad5-null and challenged with PRRSV peaked on day 2. levels of IFN- after inoculation with Ad5\u2013IFN- or Ad5-null and PRRSV. data are expressed as mean SEM of 9 pigs in each of the groups. samples were >60% in the Ad5-null/PRRSV group. the level of PRRSV in serum detected by quantitative PCR on days 5 through 9 was significantly lower. at later time points postinfection, there was no significant difference in the amount of vRNA detected between the 2 challenged groups. pigs given Ad5\u2013pIFN- and then challenged with PRRSV seroconverted to PRRSV later than pigs challenged with PRRSV given Ad5-null. the pigs in the group given Ad5-null, on average, seroconverted to PRRSV by day 7 postinfection. after day 7, there was no significant difference in antibody levels between the groups challenged with PRRSV. data are expressed as the mean SEM for 5 pigs in both the groups. data are expressed as the mean SEM for 5 pigs in all the groups. data are expressed as the mean SEM for 5 pigs in all the groups. a trend toward increased levels of IL-1, IL-8, TNF-, IL-10, and IFN- was detected in the BALF of PRRSV-infected pigs (regardless of Ad5\u2013pIFN- administration) however, PRRSV-infected pigs that were given Ad5\u2013pIFN- had lower levels of IL-6, IL-8, TNF-, IL-10, and IFN- than PRRSV-infected IFN- levels in the pigs given Ad5-null peaked on day 2 but were much lower than peak levels induced by the Ad5\u2013pIFN-. data are expressed as the mean SEM of 9 pigs in each of the Ad5\u2013IFN-/PRRSV and Ad5\u2013IFN-/mock groups and 10 pigs in the Ad5-null/PRRSV group through day 9. the level of PRRSV in serum detected by quantitative PCR on days 5 through 9 was significantly lower for pigs that received the Ad5\u2013pIFN-/mock group. at later time points postinfection, there was no significant difference in the amount of vRNA detected between the 2 challenged groups. PRRSV was isolated from the lung lavage fluid of all PRRSV-challenged pigs, regardless of Ad5\u2013pIFN- treatment. pigs given Ad5\u2013pIFN- and then challenged with PRRSV seroconverted to PRRSV later than pigs challenged with PRRSV. the pigs in the group given Ad5-null, on average, seroconverted to PRRSV by day 7 postinfection. after day 7, there was no significant difference in antibody levels between the groups challenged with PRRSV. data are expressed as the mean SEM for 5 pigs in all the groups. data are expressed as the mean SEM for 5 pigs in all the groups. IL-8, TNF-, IL-10, and IFN- were detected in the BALF of PRRSV-infected pigs. the remaining cytokine analyzed, IL-1, was expressed at very similar levels in both groups of PRRSV-infected pigs. there were no significant differences in the levels of IL-12p70, IL-2, or IL-4 among the 3 groups. administration of IFN-, as a recombinant protein or through in vivo expression of the cloned gene, may boost the host response to PRRSV, aiding in clearance and increased adaptive immunity. however, effects on development of the immune response were not considered in that first study. exposure to IFN- did not prevent the occurrence of viremia during the same time period. a single dose of Ad5\u2013pIFN- can control early viral replication and viremia. this mirrors the delay in viremia observed in previous experiment. administration of Ad5\u2013pIFN- on the day of PRRSV challenge can significantly alter the ensuing T cell response. this was detected only on day 7 postinfection, and there was no significant difference between the groups by day 9 postinfection. antibody titers were detectable in a few pigs in the Ad5\u2013pIFN- group on day 21. there are several reports suggesting that neutralizing antibodies do not correlate with decreased viremia. some papers suggest that titers must be extremely high to provide protection (17, 28) the increased antigen-specific IFN-secreting cells would actually contribute to protection. it is also necessary to understand how PRRSV subverts the host immune response."}
