{"summary": "a novel lineage C betacoronavirus, MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV), has been confirmed to be the etiological agent of MERS [2,3] a total of 200 complete genome sequences of MERS-CoV are available in GenBank. up to March 2017, a total of more than 200 complete genome sequences of MERS-CoV are available. possible recombination events among the MERS-CoV strains were also detected. the implications of the results on the origin and control of MERS-CoV are discussed. lineage 3 consists of the largest number of strains, including the human strains from an outbreak in south Korea. the same strain of MERS-CoV was also carried to China by a 44-year-old male Korean [15]. different colors represent MERS-CoV strains found in different countries. red, Saudi Arabia; blue, united arab Emirates; green, Jordan; olive, Egypt; maroon, United Kingdom; purple, Qatar; teal, United States; lime, France; aqua, Oman; fuchisa, Thailand; grey, China; yellow, south Korea. maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on S gene sequences of 219 MERS-CoV strains. the scale bar indicates the number of nucleotide substitutions per site. bootscan analysis revealed possible recombination sites in five of the 15 MERS-CoV genomes that showed different clustering in the ORF1ab and S phylogenetic trees. these five strains were all from dromedaries in Saudi Arabia. s of a lineage B3 MERS-CoV strain (red, KT368878), a lineage B4 MERS-CoV strain (blue, KT368890), and a lineage B1 MERS-CoV strain (purple, KP209313) were used as the query sequence and compared with the genome sequences of a lineage B2 MERS-CoV strain (red, KM210277), a lineage B4 MERS ation site was similar to that of KT368878 from lineage B3, while sequence downstream to the possible recombination site was similar to that of KT368890 from lineage B4. dN/dS ratios (s) in S gene across the 219 strains were calculated on codon-by-codon basis. codons 26 and 312 by fixed effects likelihood (FEL) method, codon 1250 by mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME) selected Sites by FEL Method Best Fit Model A and B 0.424737 Nil Codon 26 *, 312 *, 1224 * Codon 1224 *, 1250 * 010121 A 0.392404 Nil Nil Codon 879 * 010121 B 0.439492 Nil Codon 312 *, 1224 * Codon 1020 *, 1224 *, 1250 * 010121 A1 0.234930 Nil Nil Nil F81 A2 Insufficient available strains the mutated amino acids in clade A and B are highlighted in yellow and red colour, respectively. the figures were produced using Discovery Studio visualizer (Accelrys) most MERS-CoV strains belong to clade B, while clade A contains five strains. most MERS-CoV strains belong to clade B, while clade A contains five strains. both human and camel strains were present in most lineages. lineage B1 is dominated by MERS-CoV strains from the UAE. lineage 3 consists of the largest number of strains, including the human strains from an outbreak in south Korea. Fifteen MERS-CoV strains, including six from human and nine from dromedaries, fell into different lineages in the phylogenetic trees constructed using ORF1ab and S. four MERS-CoV strains from dromedaries belong to lineage B5 in the ORF1ab tree but lineage B4 in the S tree. maximum-likelihood phylogeny based on S gene sequences of 219 MERS-CoV strains. GTR + G + I substitution model was selected for the S gene tree. bootscan analysis revealed possible recombination sites in five strains. these five strains were all from dromedaries in saudi arabia. bootscan analysis did not reveal any obvious pattern that suggested possible recombination. KT368869 was used as the query sequence and compared with the genome sequences of a lineage B4 MERS-CoV strain (red, KJ156934), a lineage B3 MERS-CoV (blue, KT368829), and a lineage A1 MERS-CoV strain (purple, KR011263). sequence upstream to the possible recombination site was similar to that of KT368878 from lineage B3 codons 26 and 312 by fixed effects likelihood (FEL) method, codon 1250 by mixed-effects model of evolution (MEME) method, and codon 1224 by both FEL and MEME methods. codon 879 was predicted to be positively selected among clade A strains, while codons 312 and 1020 were predicted to be positively selected among clade B strains. insufficient available strains for analysis B1 0.382699 Nil Nil 010011 B2 0.405071 Nil Nil 010121 B3 0.400104 Nil Nil Codon 1250 * 001020 B4 0.641872 Nil Nil 000010 B5 0.343586 Nil Nil Codon 1020 * 010121 B6. the figures were produced using Discovery Studio visualizer (Accelrys) the divergence time of 138 selected MERS-CoV strains based on S gene analysis was shown in Figure 7. only 9 out of 17 strains from south Korea were included. MERS-CoVs circulating in human and camels since 2012 originated from multiple sources in the Middle East and North Africa. strains from a single country such as the UAE are present in lineages A2, B1, 3, 4, and 5, and strains from a single country such as the UAE are also present in lineages A1, B4 and B5. this indicates that different MERS-CoV strains have resided in dromedaries in different countries with sporadic transmission to humans. the lack of positive selection at the receptor binding domain of spike protein of MERS-CoV may suggest the virus has been well adapted in camels and humans for a period of time. however, there is a possibility that early human cases may have been missed if they were not investigated for coronaviruses. clade B MERS-CoV showed higher number of amino acid changes as compared to other lineages. this residue at 1020 also distinguishes between clade A and B strains. this residue is located at the HR region of S2 which is responsible for virus-host fusion. in most countries in the Middle East and Africa, it would be impossible to control the disease by closure of limited facilities in a restricted geographical region. for residents of the Middle East, more viable options may be through development of rapid laboratory diagnostics, antivirals, and vaccines for treatment and prevention of MERS. the analysis was conducted using a sliding window of 1000 nucleotides moving in 200 nucleotide steps with genome sequences obtained as the query. possible recombination sites suggested by the bootscan analysis were confirmed through multiple sequence alignments. 4.6. Modeling of Spike Protein Models of representative sequences of the S proteins from each clade were built with the structure of MERS-CoV S protein (5X59) using homology modeling (SWISS-MODEL) with default parameters. models were superimposed and analyzed using Discovery Studio visualizer (Accelrys) 219 complete genome sequences of ERS-CoV, including 119 from MERS-CoV found in humans and 100 from MERS-CoV in dromedaries, were included in the analysis. maximum-likelihood phylogenetic trees with 1000 bootstrap replicates were constructed using PhyML v3.0. bootscan analysis with 1000 bootstrap replicates was performed by using the nucleotide alignment of the genome sequences of MERS-CoV and Simplot version number of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site, dS, and non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site, dN, in S were calculated. sites under positive selection were inferred using different methods. kov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach implemented in BEAST (version 1.7.4) Representative strains were selected for MERS-CoV strains with close sequence similarity and obtained from the same outbreak."}
