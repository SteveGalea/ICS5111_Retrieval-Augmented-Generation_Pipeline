{"summary": "an exacerbation is an event defined in terms of subjective descriptors or symptoms. dyspnoea, cough and sputum worsen sufficiently to warrant a change in medical management. there is a need for reliable markers that reflect the pathological mechanisms that underlie exacerbation severity. erial carbon dioxide and breathing rate varied in a consistent manner with exacerbation severity and patient setting. some patients experience 'exacerbations' of their principal symptoms of dyspnoea, cough and sputum. exacerbations occur in COPD patients at a median of three times a year with half of them being unreported. different operational definitions for COPD exacerbations have been proposed in the past. these have relied primarily on symptoms, and this has delayed the development of new therapies for this condition. current therapies for exacerbations have been evaluated based on their ability to reduce symptoms, and to improve a patient's forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). we have surveyed the medical literature to identify which of the commonly accepted variables and suggested markers for COPD exacerbations change according to the ATS/ERS' levels of exacerbation severity. the long-term aim of our work is to assess the sensitivity and specificity of potential markers for use in future COPD studies. the ATS/ERS' operational classification of exacerbation severity [1] was the most sensible and feasible system for systematically assessing the patient baseline characteristics and biomarker information. from each study, we retrieved the reported demographics, spirometry, smoking status, clinical, cytological and biochemical variables as well as suggested markers of the severity of the exacerbation at baseline conditions.

Of this group, 18% fell in Exacerbation Severity Level I, 78% in Level II, and 4% in Level III. meta-analyses of typical study demographics showed that there was significant overlap in 95% confidence intervals. 3,713 68.0 (65.9 \u2013 70.1) 53.0 \u2013 83.0 I vs. III 0.12 (NS) Height (cm) 27 3,154 Levels Level I 14 2,581 169.7 (166.4 \u2013 173.0) 155.1 \u2013 184.3 I vs. II 0.25 (NS) Level II 9 247 167.1 (164.0 \u2013 170.2) 157.5 \u2013 176.6 II vs. III 0.54 (NS) Level III 4 *Bold numbers indicate total studies (without duplicates) for the specific variable of interest; # Bold numbers indicate total subjects for all COPD exacerbation severity levels with respect to the specific variable of interest.

'N' signifies the total studies and 'n' is the total subjects. only heart rate showed a statistically significant difference being higher in Level II than Level I (p = 0.014) with no difference between Levels II and III (Figure 3A). heart rates were also higher for in-patients than out-patients (p = 0.011) levels with Level I were statistically lower for in-patients than out-patients. exacerbation levels II and III were statistically different with respect to pH (p = 0.003) and bicarbonate (p = 0.002) in that pH decreased from Level II to III whereas bicarbonate increased. however, there was insufficient data available to compare out-patients with in-patients. point estimates (point), 95% confidence intervals (box) and two standard deviations (bars) are presented for Levels I to III and out- & in-patient settings. 'n' signifies the total studies and 'n' is the total subjects. the number of smoking-related pack years increased with exacerbation severity and showed a clear difference between out- and in-patient settings. this is consistent with the idea that the more a COPD patient smokes, the higher the likelihood that COPD exacerbations will be severe. the Borg Dyspnea Score showed the same trend as breathing rate. insufficient data in Level I did not allow for further comparisons. however, the observed trends were consistent with management of dyspnoea. this finding recalls a 2001 report on exacerbation treatment outcomes from over 200 randomised controlled trials. the aim of that study was to create new guidelines to improve the management of COPD exacerbations. the current literature was limited in terms of the number of studies and the amount of detail available. most COPD occurs in an out-patient setting (Level II) the compatibility between the studies of COPD exacerbation may have been limited by substantial variations in the time and location of studies. some studies failed to report the time of year or the time period for study implementation. this bias may explain any observed inconsistencies in our findings. model was developed on the basis of prior knowledge of the exacerbation rate. this gave the probabilities for COPD exacerbations for different stages of COPD. in another study, a proportional hazards model was used to identify risk factors for COPD patients hospitalised due to an exacerbation. rely on clinical judgement or past experiences for diagnosing an exacerbation. analysis of treatment effect based on predictions of exacerbation frequency and intensity. analysis could help us better select patients as well as identify potential markers for future longitudinal studies. arterial carbon dioxide tension and breathing rate consistently varied with the severity of COPD exacerbations and with in-versus out-patients. other commonly-accepted measures and suggested biomarkers for exacerbations failed to show consistent trends or lacked sufficient data to permit any meta-analysis."}
