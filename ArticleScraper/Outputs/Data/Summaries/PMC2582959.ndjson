{"summary": "a recent outbreak caused by an apparently new species of EBOV in Uganda appears less pathogenic than SEBOV or ZEBOV with a preliminary case fatality rate of about 25% [2] there are at least four different vaccine systems that have shown promise in completely protecting nonhuman primates against a lethal EBOV challenge [6]\u2013[12] of these prospective EBOV vaccine candidates. significant portion of the global population has pre-existing antibodies against the adenovirus vector which may affect efficacy [15]\u2013[17] and efficacy is likely greater with replication-competent vectors. the main concern with the VSV vaccine vector is that replication-competent vectors may present more significant safety challenges in humans particularly those with altered immune status. animal studies Nine filovirus-seronegative adult rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) (5\u201310 kg) were used for these studies. the macaques were infected three months prior to the current study with SHIV162p3. the vaccination portion of the study was conducted at BIOQUAL and was approved by the USAMRIID Laboratory Animal Use Committee. the challenge was performed in BSL-4 biocontainment at USAMRIID. hematology and serum biochemistry Total white blood cell counts, white blood cell differentials, red blood cell counts, platelet counts, hematocrit values, total hemoglobin, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were determined. samples were analyzed on a becton Dickinson FACS Calibur (Becton Dickinson, San Jose, CA) all antibodies were purchased from Becton Dickinson. clones used were CD3 \u2013 SP34, CD4 \u2013 L200, CD8 \u2013 RPA-T8 and CD20 \u2013 2H7. ZEBOV RNA was detected using a Q-RT-PCR assay targeting the matrix gene (nt position 2497\u20132556, AM690337) the low detection limit for this ZEBOV assay is 0.1 pfu/ml of plasma. hesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) (5\u201310 kg) were infected three months prior to the current study with SHIV162p3 (kindly provided by Dr. Ranajit Pal, Advanced BioScience Laboratories, Inc., Kensington, MD) these animals all had clinical laboratory evidence of SHIV infection as evidenced by reduced CD4+ T cell counts. the ZEBOV challenge was performed in BSL-4 biocontainment at USAMRIID and was approved by the USAMRIID Laboratory Animal Use Committee. animal research was conducted in compliance with the Animal Welfare Act and other Federal statues and regulations relating to animals and experiments involving animals. white blood cell counts, white blood cell differentials, red blood cell counts, platelet counts, hematocrit values, total hemoglobin, mean cell volume, mean corpuscular volume, and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration were determined from blood samples collected in tubes containing EDTA. samples were lysed and fixed in 1% paraformaldehyde and washed three times in PBS. clones used were CD3 \u2013 SP34, CD4 \u2013 L200, CD8 \u2013 RPA-T8 and CD20 \u2013 2H7. isolated plasma viral RNA was used to generate cDNA. the assay lower limit was 40 copies/ml. titration was performed by plaque assay on vero E6 cells from all blood and selected organ (liver, spleen, lung, kidney, adrenal gland, pancreas, axillary lymph node, inguinal lymph node, mesenteric lymph node, ovary or testis, and brain) dilutions of the samples were adsorbed to vero E6 monolayers in duplicate wells (0.2 ml per well); thus, the limit for a mild VSVG/ZEBOVGP viremia (103 pfu/ml) was detected only on day 2 after vaccination by virus isolation (Figure 1) and RT-PCR (data not shown) in four of the six VSVG/ZEBOVGP-immunized macaques. VSVG/ZEBOVGP was undetectable in all analyzed swab samples. thus, vaccination led to a transient viremia from virus replication at as yet placebo control animals succumbed to the ZEBOV challenge. disease did not progress in the two VSVG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated SHIV-infected monkeys that were febrile. the remaining VSVG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques remained healthy and survived. Thrombocytopenia (6) Anorexia (10), Depression (10), ALT (10), AST (10), BUN (10), GGT (10) Anorexia (11\u201313), Depression (12\u201313), Moderate rash (12\u201313), ALB (13), ALP (13), ALT (13), AST (13), AST (13), AMY (13), BUN (13), ALT (13), AST (13), AST (13), AMY (13), BUN chymosis covering more than 40% of the skin. chymosis defined by 35% drop in numbers of lymphocytes and platelets. RT-PCR was more sensitive in detecting ZEBOV in swabs which were positive on a number of samples derived from Subject #5 at day 6 and day 10. in contrast, no ZEBOV was detected in the plasma by virus isolation or RT-PCR in the four VSVG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated monkeys that survived ZEBOV challenge. however, no evidence for reactivation of VSVG/ZEBOVGP was detected from any blood or sw surviving VSVG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques were euthanized 28 days after the ZEBOV challenge to perform a virological and pathological examination of tissues. organ infectivity titration from these four animals showed no evidence of ZEBOV in any of the tissues examined. pathological and immunohistochemical evaluation of tissues from the four VSVG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated animals that survived ZEBOV challenge showed no evidence of ZEBOV antigen. contrast, ZEBOV antigen was readily detected in typical target organs (e.g., liver, spleen, adrenal gland, lymph nodes) of the two VSVG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated animals that succumbed to ZEBOV challenge. none of the six VSVG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques developed IgG antibody titers against the ZEBOV GP by the day of ZEBOV challenge (day 46 and day 59 after vaccination) a third animal developed a titer by day 28 after ZEBOV challenge (day 59 after vaccination) molgus macaques vaccinated with VSV expressing the Lassa GP. we have failed to observe any adverse events in a variety of immunocompetent laboratory mice (different inbred strains), outbred guinea pigs (Hartley strain) and goats vaccinated with the above mentioned VSV vectors. it is known that VSV G is an important VSV protein associated with pathogenicity [38],[41]. it has been shown that truncation of the cytoplasmic tail has greatly reduced vector pathogenicity in mice following intranasal inoculation. a VSV vector including portions of the VSV G and expressing HIV genes was found to be insufficiently attenuated for clinical evaluation when assessed for neurovirulence in nonhuman primates. three VSVG/ZEBOVGP-vaccinated macaques developed modest anti-ZEBOV IgG titers 14 to 28 days after vaccination. despite any humoral immune response elicited in these animals it is unlikely that antibody alone confers protection. the two rhesus macaques that grouped together with the most severe loss of CD4+ T cells were the only animals that failed to survive a lethal ZEBOV challenge. this suggests that CD4+ T cells may play a role in mediating protective immunity in EBOV infections. the number of SHIV-infected macaques in the current study was small. additional safety studies will be needed to determine whether vaccines based on attenuated VSV will prove safe in immunocompromised humans."}
