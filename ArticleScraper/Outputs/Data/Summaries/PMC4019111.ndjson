{"summary": "adenovirus E1A recruits the human Bre1 and Paf1 chromatin-modification complexes to viral genes to enhance transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. this study reveals a new mechanism employed by E1A to stimulate viral transcription, which functions at the level of transcriptional elongation by RNA polymerase II. assembly of an Icosahedral Virus Requires Only Weak Protein-Protein Interactions Bacteriophage P22 serves as a model for assembly of double-stranded DNA viruses with icosahedral capsids. the P22 procapsid, an assembly intermediate, is generated when coat protein interacts with an internal scaffolding protein."}
