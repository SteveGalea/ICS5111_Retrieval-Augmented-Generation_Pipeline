{"summary": "bats are the only flying mammal and the second most diverse group of mammals. some bat viruses cause severe human diseases, such as lyssavirus, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, and Marburg virus (16, 23, 29, 41, 47) most of the known bat viruses have been discovered in apparently healthy bats. six bat fecal samples were collected from six different locations in china. all of the locations were close to human residences. sample information, including locations, dominant bat species, and collection dates, is listed in Table 1. a volume of 150 ml of the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-m filter and a 0.22-m filter (Millipore) to remove eukaryotic and bacterial cell-sized particles. pellets were resuspended in 400 l Hanks' solution and filtered with a 0.22-m filter. the total viral nucleic acids were extracted from a 140-l sample with the QIAamp viral RNA minikit reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 37\u00b0C for 60 min, and 95\u00b0C for 5 min. reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min, 37\u00b0C for 60 min, and then chilled on ice for 2 min. 2 l of the reaction product was used as the template in a PCR mix. purified DNA was used directly for cluster generation and sequencing analysis. image files generated by the sequencer were then processed to produce digital-quality data. clean reads of 35 bp were obtained after removing the uncalled bases, incorrect primers, and adaptors. sequences with similarity to eukaryotes, fungi, and bacteria were removed. s of one dicistrovirus and one densovirus were amplified and sequenced using the nucleic acid extracted from bat feces from Tianjin and Hubei. sequences were confirmed by rapid amplification of cDNA ends using the 5\u2032/3\u2032 RACE kit (Roche, Germany) sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce final viral genomes. clean plastic sheets measuring 2.0 by 2.0 m were placed under known bat roosting sites at approximately 18:00. fresh fecal samples were collected at approximately 5:30 to 6:00 the following morning and were stored in liquid nitrogen. each fecal sample from 6 locations was resuspended in Hanks' balanced salt solution. the pellets were resuspended in 400 l Hanks' solution and filtered with a 0.22-m filter. the filtrate was treated with Turbo DNase (final concentration, 20 U/ml; Ambion) and RNase A (final concentration, 0.1 mg/ml; Fermentas) for 30 min to digest non-particle-protected nucleic acids. the reaction mixture was incubated at 25\u00b0C for 10 min and 37\u00b0C for 60 min. 2 l of the reaction product was used as the template in a PCR mix containing 5 l of 10 KOD-Plus DNA polymerase buffer (Toyobo), 2 l 25 mM MgSO4, 5 l of 2 mM dNTP. clean reads of 35 bp were obtained after removing uncalled bases, incorrect primers, and adaptors. reads and contigs with no similarity to the GenBank nucleotide database were then aligned against the GenBank nonredundant database. sequences with similarity to eukaryotes, fungi, and bacteria were removed. overlapping sequences were confirmed by PCR and sequencing. sequences were assembled and manually edited to produce final viral genomes. amino acid sequences encoded by ORFs were compared with those of other dicistroviruses and densoviruses. most of the reads were related to insect viruses, particularly members of the subfamily Densovirinae, family Parvoviridae. most of the reads were related to members of the subfamily Densovirinae, family Parvoviridae. the densovirus genome consists of a 3.8- to 6-kb single-stranded linear DNA that has two major ORFs. the left ORF encodes the nonstructural protein NS1, while the right ORF encodes the structural protein VP1. most of the contigs had low amino acid identities (50%) with the known viruses. all of the selected contigs were distantly related to densoviruses. phylogenetic analysis based on alignment with 150 aa of the partial VP1 (A) and 170 aa of the partial NS1 region (B) Adeno-associated virus (AAV) belongs to the genus Dependovirus in the subfamily Parvovirinae. the genome of AAV is approximately 4.7 kb and contains two major ORFs. it encodes the replication-related protein (Rep) and the capsid protein (Cap) contig SC630 had 41% amino acid identity with VP1 of bocavirus 2 pig/ZJD/China/2006, genus Bocavirus. the members of the family have single-stranded positive-sense RNA genomes and infect arthropods. the genomes of dicistroviruses are approximately 8 to 10 kb. dicistrovirus-related contig SC2803 based on the 382 aa of partial NS region. dicistrovirus-related sequences were found in stool samples from humans, wild chimpanzees, and bats. d nonanucleotide motif is located within the 3\u2032 region of the rep ORF. the phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment of the complete amino acid sequence of the Rep protein (267 aa) contigs SC2797 and SC3066 had amino acid identities of 45% and 66%, respectively, with the picorna-like virus Eptesicus fuscus. most of the sequences were closely related to the sequences of known phages, including members of myoviridae (18 contigs), Podoviridae (12 contigs), and Siphoviridae (2 contigs). a total of 12 different sequences related to densoviruses were obtained. all target viruses were detected in at least two samples. amplicons except one had high nucleotide identities of 86 to 100% with the respective target viruses. b TJ HB GD HN YNH YNM BgDNV +(92%) +(54%) BmDNV +(86%) CeDNV +(91%) +(91%) CpDNV +(97%) +(98%) a BgDNV, Blattella germanica densovirus; BmDNV, Bombyx mori densovirus; CpDNV, Culex pipiens densovirus; MlDNV, Galleria five ORFs were identified in the genome and arrangement was similar to the known BgDNV which can infect Blattella germanica (German cockroach) all ORFs had low amino acid identities to BgDNV, suggesting this virus was temporarily named BgDNV-like virus. the genome contained two ORFs separated by a 176-bp intergenic region. the 5\u2032 ORF (538 to 6,642 nt) encoded the nonstructural proteins. the 3\u2032 ORF (6,818 to 9,241 nt) encoded the structural protein. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions were 537 and 678 bp. analysis showed that all variants belonged to the bat coronavirus HKU9 clade, which belonged to the novel Betacoronavirus subgroup 2d. results further demonstrate the genetic diversity of BtCoV HKU9 in bat populations (22). a total of 8,746,417 reads (35 bp each) with a total length of 306,124,595 bp were obtained. most reads were related to insect viruses, particularly members of the subfamily Densovirinae, family Parvoviridae. 129 assembled contigs (>100 nt) were constructed and compared with GenBank. 32 contigs were homologous to phages and 97 were homologous to eukaryotic viruses. most of the contigs had low similarities with the protein sequences of known viruses. the left ORF encodes the nonstructural protein NS1 and the right ORF encodes the structural protein VP1. 22 contigs related to densoviruses had significant hits to 7 species of the genus Densovirus, 3 were related to 2 members of the genus Brevidensovirus. most of the contigs had low amino acid identities (50%) with the known viruses. Adeno-associated virus (AAV) belongs to the genus Dependovirus in the subfamily Parvovirinae. the genome of AAV is approximately 4.7 kb and contains two major ORFs. contig SC4399 (213 bp) had no identity at the nucleotide level with any known AAV. 58% identity at the amino acid level with the Cap protein of human AAV-3. the subfamily Parvovirinae includes four other genera. viruses are approximately 8 to 10 kb and contain two nonoverlapping ORFs. the 5\u2032-proximal ORF encodes a nonstructural protein, and the 3\u2032-proximal ORF encodes a structural protein (31) there were 7 contigs related to 6 dicistroviruses and 5 contigs to unclassified single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus, Solenopsis invicta virus (SINV) a small, circular DNA virus with a full genome size of 1,578 bp (SC703) was related to the bat circovirus-like virus and temporarily named BtCV-SC703. the virus had an amino acid identity of 48% with TM-6C (24). contig SC3668 (143 bp) had 41% identity with the Rep protein of circovirus NG11. phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the alignment of the complete amino acid sequence of the Rep protein (267 aa) contig SC2842 was homologous to E1 of human papillomavirus. it belongs to the papillomaviridae family of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses. most of the sequences were closely related to the sequences of known phages. virus of bees (IAPV), and Rhopalosiphum padi virus (RhPV) were amplified and confirmed by sequencing. all target viruses were detected in at least two samples. amplicons except one had high nucleotide identities of 86 to 100%. alPV +(94%) +(95%) IAPV +(86%) RhPV +(98%) a BgDNV, Blattella germanica densovirus; BmDNV, Bombyx mori densovirus; CpDNV, Culex pipiens densovirus; MlDNV, Mythimna loreyi densovirus; AlPV, aphid lethal paralysis virus; IAPV, Israel acute para all ORFs had low amino acid identities to BgDNV. phylogenetic analysis showed this virus was clustered with other members of densovirinae and close to BgDNV. bat coronaviruses have been studied extensively since the global disease outbreak caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) there were 16 amplicons obtained, all from sample YNH, a community dominated by Hipposideros bats. the alignment of the 384-bp consensus sequences showed that there were 8 variants (BtCoV YNH-1-8) within the 16 amplicons. -1, bat coronavirus HKU9-1; BtCoV HKU9-2, bat coronavirus HKU9-2; BtCoV HKU9-3, bat coronavirus HKU9-4; BtCoV HKU9-5-1, bat coronavirus HKU9-5-1; BtCoV HKU9-5-1, bat coronavirus HKU9-5-1; BtCoV HKU9-5-2, bat coronavirus HKU9-5-2 high-throughput sequencing is a powerful tool for the microbial metagenomic analysis of a specific environmental sample (11) this technique has been used to discover a large diversity of novel viruses that could not have been identified by traditional virus culture methods. this is the first reported virome analysis in animals in china. only 10 pairs of primers, which target 6 densoviruses and 4 dicistroviruses, successfully amplified the expected fragments. all of the amplified fragments, except BgDNV in the Myotis bat samples collected in Yunnan, have high nucleotide identities with the target viruses. a large number of reads related to animal or human parvoviruses were discovered in the Solexa data. these sequences have very low identities with known parvoviruses at the amino acid level. this indicates that a large diversity of parvoviruses are circulating in bat populations. two contigs match most closely with a picorna-like virus. the contig BtCV-SC703 most closely matches with TM6, a circovirus-like virus detected in a Texas bat stool sample dominated by Tadarida brasiliensis. supplementary material supp_86_8_4620___index.html (1.4KB, html)."}
