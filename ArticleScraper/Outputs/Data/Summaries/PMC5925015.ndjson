{"summary": "the first human coronavirus (HCoV) appeared in reports in the mid-1960s. two species were first detected: HCoV-229E and subsequently HCoV-OC43. there is no report describing life-threatening conditions in immunocompetent adults. bronchial breathing at her right and left lower lobes revealed diffuse rhonchi symmetrically all over her chest. Chest CT scan showed bibasilar pleural effusions and diffuse consolidations plus ground glass opacities involving all lung fields. systemic corticosteroids and bronchodilators were added about 40 hours after her hospitalization. the patient was in severe respiratory distress and remained tachypneic. a new chest X-ray showed multiple consolidations all over her lung fields. a repeat one-step RT-PCR in a nasal sample confirmed the exclusive presence of human coronavirus 229E. an adult patient with pneumonia tested positive for HCoV-229E has been described in a study conducted in rural Thailand. it is not made clear if other comorbidities were present. no study controlling for age and underlying illness has demonstrated an epidemiologic association between infection with HcoV-229E in healthy adults and any illness other than the common cold. new RT-PCR methods have successfully diagnosed human coronavirus infections. multiplex RT-PCR has shown to be more sensitive than viral culture and antigen detection. it is the first time that human coronavirus HCoV-229E has been detected in severe lower respiratory tract infection with ARDS of a healthy adult with no comorbidities."}
