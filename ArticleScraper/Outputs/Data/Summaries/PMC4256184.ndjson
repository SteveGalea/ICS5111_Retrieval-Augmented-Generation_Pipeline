{"summary": "a single-stranded RNA virus is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus (1, 2). Field strains of PEDV have caused severe diarrhea in swine herds in china since 2010. mortality rate in neonatal piglets affected with variant field strains of PEDV can reach as high as 100% (3\u20137) the replicase, consisting of 1a and 1b is 20,345 nt in length; the replicase, consisting of 1a and 1b is 20,345 nt in length; the S, ORF3, E, M, and N genes and 3\u2032 UTR are 4,161 nt, 675 nt, 231 nt, 681 nt, 1,326 nt, and 334 nt in size, respectively. phylogen CH/GDZQ/2014 was a very virulent field PEDV strain isolated from Guangdong Province in southern china. the genome data provided here will help better understand molecular characteristics of variant field strains of PEDV currently affecting swine in Guangdong Province."}
