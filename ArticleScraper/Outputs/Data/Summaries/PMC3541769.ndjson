{"summary": "enterohepatic Helicobacter species (EHS) have gained recognition in the field of emerging infectious pathogens. infection by this group of micro-organisms is generally characterized by colonization of the distal gastrointestinal tract and, in select cases, the biliary tree. H. pullorum has been identified by PCR in humans with inflammatory bowel disease, hepatitis, cholecystitis and hepatocelluar carcinoma. a recent report identified an association between EHS and Crohn\u2019s disease. in July 2009, routine surveillance testing detected a Helicobacter species in C57BL/6NTac mice and BN/MolTac Brown Norway (BN) rats. BN rats were fed a standard pelleted diet and provided water ad libitum. each rat was inoculated by oro-gastric gavage. each rat was gavaged once every other day for a total of three doses. animals were housed singly and tested every 2 weeks for H. pullorum colonization. at 30 w.p.i., animals were euthanized. qPCR primers were derived from the cdtB gene as described previously. qPCR primers were derived from the cdtB gene as described previously. cultures from BN rats were harvested and confirmed to be H. pullorum. PCR was performed at both the pre-infection and final end points as well as intermittently throughout the 30-week study. all rats were euthanized by CO2 inhalation. blood was collected to assess specific IgG response to H. pullorum. hepatitis was defined by a hepatitis index equal to or greater than 4. genus-specific primers and H. pullorum cytolethal distending toxin B (cdtB) gene species-specific primers were subjected to restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. BN rats were free from the following murine agents certified by the vendor. each rat was inoculated by oro-gastric gavage with 400 l of OD600 (4108 c.f.u.) of an H. pullorum isolate. each rat was gavaged once every other day for a total of three doses. animals were housed singly and tested every 2 weeks for H. pullorum colonization. quantitative PCR assay (qPCR) used for quantifying levels of H. pullorum is described elsewhere. a standard curve containing a serial 10-fold dilution of known genomic copies (106 to 101) of H. pullorum MIT 98-5489 was used to enumerate H. pullorum in tissue and faecal DNA samples. single colonies with visual and physical characteristics of H. pullorum were replated to obtain a pure culture. cultures from BN rats were harvested and confirmed to be H. pullorum. hepatitis was defined by a hepatitis index equal to or greater than 4 for the liver and large intestine. hepatitis was defined by a hepatitis index equal to or greater than 4. samples were screened for Helicobacter species by PCR using 16S rRNA gene genus-specific primers and H. pullorum cytolethal distending toxin B (cdtB) gene species-specific primers. all rats were maintained in an AAALAC accredited facility. each rat was inoculated by oro-gastric gavage with 400 l of OD600 (4108 c.f.u.) of an H. pullorum isolate. each rat was gavaged once every other day for a total of three doses. specific primers (F1, 5\u2032-GTCTTTTGAGTGGATTCT-3\u2032) and (R2, 5\u2032-CACTCCGGGTGTGTAT-3\u2032) were used to determine infection status at all other time points. qPCR primers were derived from the cdtB gene as described previously. 0.3 ml to 0.5 ml of suspended faeces was collected and filtered using a 0.45 m syringe filter (Pall Corporation) an unfiltered suspension was streaked on CVA plates containing cefoperazone, vancomycin and amphotericin B. single colonies with visual and physical characteristics of H. pullorum were replated to obtain a pure culture. hepatitis was defined by a hepatitis index equal to or greater than 4. hepatitis was defined by a hepatitis index equal to or greater than 4. oedema, epithelial defects, crypt atrophy, hyperplasia and dysplasia were scored at separate locations (caecum at the ileocecocolic junction, proximal colon and distal colon) Molecular analyses indicated a high prevalence of naturally acquired H. pullorum infection in brown Norway rats. RFLP using HhaI (a) and AluI (b) digestion of 1200 bp PCR products from a BN rat. experimentally infected brown Norway rats were persistently infected with H. pullorum. sy. IgG seroconversion to H. pullorum was apparent in 4/6 BN rats by 2 w.p.i. and in all five colonized rats by 12 w.p.i. and was maintained through 24 w.p.i. all six BN rats had minimal portal liver inflammation and one rat had minimal lobular inflammation. all six BN rats had moderate to robust H. pullorum IgG responses. RFLP using HhaI (a) and AluI (b) digestion of 1200 bp PCR products from a BN rat. experimentally infected brown Norway rats were persistently infected with H. pullorum. H. pullorum was apparent in 4/6 BN rats by 2 w.p.i. and in all five colonized rats by 12 w.p.i. During the 30-week experiment, all rats were clinically normal with no signs of diarrhoea. ELISA data measuring IgG response to H. pullorum in BN rats indicated seroconversion in four out of the six rats by 2 w.p.i. and five out of the six rats by 12 w.p.i. H. pullorum infection did not elicit clinical signs or cause gastrointestinal pathology in rats. findings consistent with lack of gastrointestinal lesions in mice persistently infected with H. pullorum. only three EHS, H. bilis, H. trogontum and H. muridarum, were known to naturally colonize rats. this is the first report confirming that rats can be persistently colonized by an EHS known to colonize humans."}
