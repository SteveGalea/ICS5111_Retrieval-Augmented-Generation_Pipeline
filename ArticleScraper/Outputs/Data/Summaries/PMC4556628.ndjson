{"summary": "the geographic distribution of these mosquito-borne flaviviruses is expanding due to increased travel, trade and climate change. the mammalian response to flavivirus infection has been well studied. there is currently no specific vaccine or anti-viral for WNV approved for use in humans. ubiquitin activating enzyme transfers activated ubiquitin to E2. ligase binds ubiquitin-charged E2 and the substrate, facilitating ligation of ubiquitin to the internal lysine residue on the substrate. ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway has been shown to be important in all stages of viral infection in mammalian cells. viruses encode adaptors that recruit and redirect host E3 ligases to ubiquitylate host proteins, leading to degradation. ubiquitin-proteasomal system plays a major role during infection in mosquitoes. total RNA was collected at 48 h post-infection (hpi) for high-throughput transcriptome sequencing. a total of 265 unique transcripts were identified as differentially accumulated (>2-fold) between control and WNV-infected cells. genes in the ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway comprised 12% of differentially regulated transcripts. B. Hsu cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected at 48 hpi. real-time RT-qPCR was performed using primers for ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway genes found to be differentially regulated in the RNA-Seq screen. a 20-fold reduction in cells treated with 10 M MG132 (30 pfu/ml) compared to untreated controls (600 pfu/ml) these results suggest the proteasomal pathway is required for efficient WNV replication in Culex cells. total RNA was collected at 48 hpi and real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers. the proteasomal pathway plays an important role post-viral entry. the proteasomal pathway plays an important role post-viral entry. female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were infected with WNV (NY99-4132 strain) by blood-feeding. RNA was collected from whole carcasses and dissected midguts at 24 hpi. RNA was collected from the midgut and the remaining carcass. Error bars represent standard error from four pooled mosquitoes. no dsRNA or GFP dsRNA was used as a silencing control. rpL32 primers were used as an internal control. error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments. western blots performed using anti-NS5 antibody showed a significantly lower level of WNV NS5 in cells treated with CxCul4 dsRNA compared with control cells. real-time RT-qPCR showed increased WNV NS1 levels (>4-fold) in cells transfected with CxCul4 compared with empty vector (Control), indicating increased viral replication. total RNA was collected 48 hpi and real-time RT-qPCR was performed using primers for Vir1 and CxVago. expression of both CxVir1 and CxVago was upregulated following WNV infection. previous studies have shown that, once expressed, CxVago is secreted and activates the Jak-STAT pathway. a. Hsu cells were transfected with plasmid overexpressing Culex cullin (CxCul4) Empty vector (Control) was used as transfection control. at 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV. coli, WNV or PBS for 1 h after normalising with Renilla transfection control. Error bars represent standard error from six separate samples. F. Hsu cells were transfected with dsRNA against Culex cullin (Cul4 dsRNA) or Culex STAT (STAT dsRNA) at 24 h post-transfection, the cells were infected with WNV and total RNA was collected 48 hpi. real-time RT-qPCR conducted on total RNA collected 48 hpi showed decreased CxVir1 expression in cells overexpressing CxCul4 compared with control (empty vector) cells. however, treatment of cells overexpressing CxCul4 with MG132 or PYR-41 resulted in significantly higher levels of CxVir1 expression compared with untreated cells. RNA was collected 48 hours post-transfection and real time RT-qPCR was performed using CxRpL32 primers. the results confirm that pro-viral effect of CxCul4 is via ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway. total RNA was collected at 24 hours post-transfection. real time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Cul4-specific primers. Error bars represent standard error from three separate experiments. the cells were infected with WNV and treated with MG132 (1 M) and cell lysates were collected 24 hours post-infection. Western blot was performed using anti-ubiquitin antibody. FT represents flow-through and IP represents immunoprecipitate. western blot was performed using anti-CxSTAT antibody. the results showed decreased STAT levels in cells transfected with WNV-NS1 or WNV-NS5. the levels returned to baseline in cells also transfected with dsRNA against CxCul4. female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were microinjected with dsRNA against CxCul4. the mosquitoes were infected with WNV by blood-feeding 24 h post-microinjection. saliva from individual mosquitoes was collected in a capillary tube. real-time RT-qPCR results also showed a significant increase in CxVir1 mRNA expression in carcass (3-fold) and midgut (5-fold) in CxCul4-knockdown mosquitoes, indicating increased Jak-STAT signaling. saliva from 3 mosquitoes with CxCul4 dsRNA injection showed higher viral titers. real-time RT-qPCR was performed using Culex Cul4 primers on mosquito carcasses. control (GFP dsRNA) N = 24; Cul4 dsRNA N = 20. inset shows individual mosquito data.

Real-time RT-qPCR was performed using WNV NS1 primers on mosquito carcasses. a total of 265 unique transcripts were identified as differentially accumulated (>2-fold) between control and WNV-infected cells. a total of 265 unique transcripts were identified as differentially accumulated (>2-fold) between control and WNV-infected cells, with 130 transcripts up-regulated and 135 transcripts down-regulated after infection. real-time RT-qPCR was performed using primers for ubiquitin-proteasomal pathway genes found to be differentially regulated in the RNA-Seq screen. ribosomal protein L32 primers were used as an internal control. the graph was plotted as fold-increase over control. proteasomal pathway is important during WNV infection. A. Hsu cells were pre-treated with MG132 at various concentrations for 1 h prior to infection with WNV at 4\u00b0C. total RNA was collected at 48 hpi. real-time RT-qPCR was performed using NS1 primers. the proteasomal pathway plays an important role post-viral entry. previous report suggests the proteasomal pathway has a role during entry of WNV into mammalian cells. female Culex annulirostris mosquitoes were infected with WNV by blood-feeding. total RNA was collected from carcasses and dissected midguts at 24 hpi. RT-qPCR was performed using Culex cullin (Cul4) primers. B.

RNA was quantified and checked for quality using a bioanalyser. experiment was conducted in duplicate with two RNA-Seq libraries generated for WNV-infected cells and two for uninfected control cells. the control was set arbitrarily at 1 and fold-increase over control was calculated by the Ct method. the results were plotted in graph format as mean SD. supernatant media from cells infected with WNV (10-fold dilutions) were added onto confluent Vero cell monolayers in 6-well plates. Plaques formed within 72 hpi were counted and the results were plotted graphically. the experiments were conducted at least twice, each with duplicates.
