{"summary": "four-week-old crossbred pigs were kept for 2 weeks to acclimatize before inoculation. pigs had preexisting antibodies against PRCV, likely of maternal origin (4). pigs were housed in chicken isolators inside a biosafety level 4 animal cubicle. cell suspension contained 95% epithelial cells and 5% fibroblasts after 24 h of incubation. cell suspension contained 95% epithelial cells and 5% fibroblasts after 24 h of incubation. pigs were inoculated simultaneously. six-week-old chickens were inoculated by the same routes with 106 PFU of SARS-CoV per pig. three pigs and three chickens were mock inoculated and served as negative controls. blood, nasal (nares), throat, and rectal (cloacal) swabs were collected on alternate days, starting at 2 days after inoculation. ulbecco\u2019s PBS (Sigma) supplemented with antimicrobial drugs stood for 1 h in the antimicrobial mix. the suspension was centrifuged at 2000 x g, 4\u00b0C, 20 min. the supernatant was diluted 10-fold in the corresponding media for the individual cell types. the inoculum was then removed and replaced with the appropriate media. the 389-nt amplicon is located within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (ORF 1b). the 389-nt amplicon is located within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (ORF 1b). RT-PCR conditions were developed at the Bernhard-Nocht Institute for Tropical Medicine, Hamburg, Germany. SARS-CoV antibody Detection Porcine serum collected before inoculation and during the final bleed was tested for antibodies against SARS by a standard plaque reduction neutralizing test. the highest serum dilution, which produced a plaque reduction of at least 90%, was defined as the titration end point. the results were read after 3 days of incubation at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. animals Six 4-week-old crossbred pigs were kept for 2 weeks to acclimatize. the pigs had preexisting antibodies against PRCV, likely of maternal origin. Virus inoculum was incubated on cells for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. cells were overlayed with 2% carboxymethyl-cellulose (Sigma, St. Louis, MO)/dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) suspension contained 95% epithelial cells and 5% fibroblasts after 24 h of incubation. markers for epithelial cells (cytokeratin) and fibroblasts (vimentin) were detected. ase\u2013polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to detect virus replication on chicken embryo epithelial kidney cells seeded at a density of 106 cells/cm2 in 24-well plates (Costar) the tissues were ground in a miniMix blender (Topac, Hingham, MA) to prepare a 10% w/v suspension in Dulbecco\u2019s PBS (Sigma) supplemented with antimicrobial drugs and stood for 1 h in the anti the Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR kit was also used for the two-step RT-PCR. forward primer CAG AGC CAT GCC TAA CATG and reverse primer AAT GTT TAC GGT AAG CG were used in the RT-PCR reaction. the 389-nt amplicon is located within the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase gene (ORF 1b) RNA template was removed by digestion at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. reverse and forward N primers and platinum Pfx DNA polymerase were added. amplicons were sequenced with respective primers to verify the identity of bands. each of the above viruses was diluted to 100 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50)/well, mixed with doubling serial dilutions of test serum beginning at 1:5. the virus-serum mixtures were then added to 96-well microtiter plates (Costar) containing overnight confluent monolayers of vero V76 cells or PT-K75 cells. the tissue was spiked with SARS-CoV before homogenization, and virus recovery was compared to the correspondingly diluted inoculum on vero E6 and vero V76 cells. the results were again negative, as confirmed by RT-PCR on the inoculated cells. RT-PCR with the N and the BNI primers detected viral RNA equivalent to approximately 10-3/-4 PFU. positive results using a two-step RT-PCR assay, aimed at detecting negative strands of viral RNA, indicated that replicating virus was present in the above positive pig and chicken blood samples. dpi chicken no.
