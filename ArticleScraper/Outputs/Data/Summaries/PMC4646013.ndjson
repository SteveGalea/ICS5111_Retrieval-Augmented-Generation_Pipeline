{"summary": "EMCV is a small, non-enveloped virus containing single-stranded positive-sense RNA of 7.8 kb flanked by two untranslated regions (UTRs) the 5\u2032UTR is 800\u20131,200 nucleotides long, while the 3\u2032UTR is 120 nucleotides long with short stem-loop structures, followed by a poly(A) tail. free NF-B dimers are transferred into the nucleus and stimulate the transcription of target genes encoding inflammatory and immunoregulatory molecules. the canonical NF-B signaling pathway is also regulated by different physiological stimuli such as signals emanating from the interleukin-1 receptor (IL-1R), the tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) and other cytokine receptors (5, 9, 10). TANK is cleaved by EMCV 3C at the 197 and 291 glutamine residues. this is the first report to show that EMCV 3C specifically cleaves TANK in vitro. several positive RNA viruses have adopted a novel mechanism to regulate NF-B signaling using their proteases.

HEK293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing TANK or its deletion mutants corresponding to the cleaved fragments. TANK-291C was an unstable fragment, which degraded via the proteasome system because the proteasome inhibitor MG132 could block its degradation. the fragments were coexpressed with EMCV 3C or EMCV 3C-DM in the presence or absence of MG132.

TANK cleavage by EMCV 3C relieves its inhibitory effect on NF-B signaling. hek293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing TANK or its cleaved fragments, along with the NF-B-Luc reporter gene. intact TANK is required for the inhibition of TRAF6-mediated NF-B activation. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing TRAF6 and TANK or its cleaved fragments. expressions of TRAF6, TANK, and GAPDH were analyzed by Western blotting. TRAF6 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that serves as a platform to recruit the kinase TAK1 and the IKK complex. following stimulation, TRAF6 begins to oligomerize and activates its ubiquitin ligase activity, which leads to lysine 63 (Lys-63)-linked polyubiquitination of target proteins such as NEMO and TRAF6 itself (38). the cells were harvested when the cytopathic effects were visible. TANK was cleaved in FMDV-infected cells, but not in EV71- and CVB3-infected cells. a protease with activity site mutant (H46Y) did not cleave TANK. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-TANK and FMDV L protease (FMDV L) or FMDV 3C (B) or FMDV 3C or its double mutant (FMDV 3C-DM) the cell lysates were analyzed by Western blotting. TANK was cleaved by PRRSV nonstructural protein 4 (Nsp4) and EAV Nsp4, but not NS3 proteases encoded by SARS NS3, TGEV NS3, JEV NS3 and CSFV NS3. further investigation of the cleavage sites and effects of the cleavage products on the host antiviral response and viral replication are warranted. NEMO is a substrate of FMDV 3C and PRRSV Nsp4. EMCV 3C is the only cysteine protease encoded by the EMCV genome. EMCV 3C preferentially cleaves between Gln or Glu and Gly, Ser, or Ala residues. TANK(197\u2013291) and TANK(291C) fragments are unstable and rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. why EMCV 3C does not cleave TANK at Gln-197 during EMCV infection remains unclear. TANK is identified as a TRAF2- and TRAF6-interacting protein (11, 49) it contains a positive regulatory domain at its N terminus (N-TANK, 1\u2013190 amino acids) and a negative regulatory domain at its C terminus (C-TANK) (11) N-TANK activates NF-B synergistically with full-length TRAF2, whereas C-TANK has a potent inhibitory effect. TANK suppresses TLR signaling by down-regulating TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination. cleavage of TANK by EMCV 3C enhances the polyubiquitination of TRAF6. this may explain why NF-B is activated in EMCV-infected cells. TANK is cleaved by PRRSV Nsp4 and EAV Nsp4, which are the main proteases required for viral polyprotein cleavage. however, four other viral proteases encoded by different members of coronaviridae and flaviviridae are unable to cleave TANK. EMCV 3C is the only cysteine protease encoded by the EMCV genome. cleavage of NEMO impairs its ability to induce downstream IFN production and act as a signaling adaptor in the RIG-I/MDA5 pathway. EMCV 3C cleaves poly(A)-binding protein at a specific site, which inhibits EMCV replication (46). TANK is cleaved at Gln-197 and Gln-291 by EMCV 3C in vitro, yielding at least five cleaved fragments. TANK fragments are unstable and rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. the survival rate of p50/ mice is higher than that of p50+/+ mice. EMCV infection is tightly linked to the animals' ability to clear the virus from the heart in vivo. TANK inhibits NF-B activation by enhancing NF-B polyubiquitination. cleavage of TANK by EMCV 3C relieves the inhibitory effect of TANK on NF-B activation in EMCV-infected cells. TANK is cleaved by PRRSV Nsp4 and EAV Nsp4, which are the main proteases required for viral polyprotein cleavage. however, four other viral proteases encoded by different members of coronaviridae and flaviviridae unable to cleave TANK. cleavage of TANK by different viral proteases may represent a common mechanism to regulate host innate immune and inflammatory responses. but the importance of viral protease-mediated cleavage of TANK and the functions of the cleaved fragments under normal physiological conditions remain unknown. EMCV 3C Cleaves TANK Many viruses have evolved different strategies to evade host innate immune responses. EMCV 3C is the only cysteine protease encoded by the EMCV genome. once translated, it is activated and starts to cleave the two viral polyproteins and host proteins in cis or in trans with a high degree of substrate specificity (1). EMCV 3C preferentially cleaves between Gln or Glu and Gly, Ser, or Ala residues. EMCV 3C may interact with other viral proteins or host proteins during EMCV replication. a much lower amount of EMCV 3C is produced during EMCV infection compared with EMCV overexpression in vitro. TANK contains a positive regulatory domain at its N terminus (N-TANK, 1\u2013190 amino acids) and a negative regulatory domain at its C terminus (C-TANK) (11) N-TANK activates NF-B synergistically with full-length TRAF2. TANK inhibits the activation of NF-B by TNF, IL-1, and CD40. cleavage of TANK by EMCV 3C enhances the polyubiquitination of NF-B in EMCV-infected cells. cleavage of TANK relieves the inhibitory effect of TANK on NF-B activation by enhancing NF-B polyubiquitination. four other viral proteases encoded by different members of coronaviridae and flaviviridae are unable to cleave TANK. however, four other viral proteases encoded by different members of flaviviridae are unable to cleave TANK. TANK is a novel target of some certain positive-sense RNA viruses. coxsackievirus 3C protease cleaves the inhibitor of NF-B (IB), and the proteolytic fragment forms a stable complex with NF-B. the complex is translocated to the nucleus where it inhibits NF-B transcriptional activation, which consequently increases cell apoptosis and decreases viral replication. TANK is cleaved at Gln-197 and Gln-291 by EMCV 3C in vitro. TANK fragments are unstable and rapidly degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome system. EMCV 3C may preferentially cleave TANK at the Gln-Gly rather than Gln-Ala. TANK is identified as a TRAF2- and TRAF6-interacting protein (11, 49) it has been demonstrated that TANK contains a positive regulatory domain at its N terminus (N-TANK, 1\u2013190 amino acids) and a negative regulatory domain at its C terminus (C-TANK) (11) cleavage of TANK by EMCV 3C relieves the inhibitory effect of TANK on NF-B activation. TANK suppresses TLR signaling by down-regulating TRAF6 auto-ubiquitination. cleavage of TANK by EMCV 3C enhances the polyubiquitination of TRAF6. mitochondrial outer membrane protein MARCH5 interacts with TANK. MARCH5 impairs its ability to inhibit TRAF6-mediated NF-B signal transduction. TANK is cleaved by PRRSV Nsp4 and EAV Nsp4, which are the main proteases required for viral polyprotein cleavage. the cleavage of TANK by EMCV 3C impairs the ability of TANK to inhibit TRAF6-mediated NF-B signaling. our findings provide a novel insight on the prevention and treatment of virus-related diseases."}
