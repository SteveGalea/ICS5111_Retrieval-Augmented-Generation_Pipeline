{"summary": "these viruses are a diverse group of single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses. each of these genotypes is subdivided into several subgenotypes. the prevalence of the 1a, 1b, and 2a subgenotypes has changed over time. a large group of non-PI cattle were infected with a phylogenetically different strain of BVDV-1a, -1b, or -2a. we commingled 10 confirmed BVDV PI cattle with a phylogenetically different strain of BVDV-1a, -1b, or -2a. PI-2, PI-5, 6 with BVDV-1b genotype infections (PI-1, PI-3, PI-4, PI-6, PI-8, and PI-10) and 2 with BVDV-2a genotype infections (PI-7, PI-9) were chosen for the commingle study. the BVDV-positive status of all 10 PI cattle was confirmed several weeks prior to commingling. the BVDV-positive status was also reaffirmed on the day of their arrival (d-1) by VI on buffy coats and nasal swab, and by RT-rtPCR with kit B on buffy coat, serum, and nasal swabs samples collected on d-1 and again on the last day of the study (d+27). the average threshold cycle (Ct; the first cycle at which fluorescence is detected above the baseline) values from 2 ear notch sampling dates (2 BVDV-negative status of non-PI cattle was affirmed by VI on buffy coat and nasal swab samples using kit B. kit B was used in all subsequent BVDV RT-rtPCR evaluations on samples collected during the commingling study. animals were handled in accordance with standard feedlot practices. sample collection after commingling Samples were collected from non-PI cattle. serum, nasal swab, whole blood buffy coat, and ear notch biopsies were collected from each non-PI animal. BVDV RT-rtPCR A one-step RT-rtPCR assay was performed using kit B to identify BVDV RNA in serum, buffy coat, nasal swab, and ear notch samples. each sample assayed in a 25-L final reaction by following kit manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the sample was considered suspect BVDV-positive when the BVDV Ct was 38\u201340 and the RNA control Ct was 30\u201334. a positive IFA result was based on direct visualization of cytoplasmic candy apple green fluorescence in cells using an inverted epifluorescence microscope. six selected BVDV strains were used for VN (n = 5, from PI animals PI-1, PI-5, PI-7, PI-8, and PI-9) and the 6th strain, a \u201cnovel\u201d BVDV-1b from non-PI animal 12) isolated from buffy coats. the infectivity level for the VN indicator viruses was determined. d-1 BVDV VN titers were determined on 4 replicates of serial 2-fold dilutions of the sera. animals with at least a 4-fold rise in titer from the initial sampling date were considered seronegative to the indicator BVDV strain. RT-PCR was completed as follows: 50\u00b0C, 30 min; 95\u00b0C, 15 min; followed by 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C, 20 s; 58\u00b0C, 30 s; 72\u00b0C, 45 s. assembled sequences were used to generate a neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree. a binomial probability test was completed to assess the equality of the proportions of non-PI cattle BVDV RT-rtPCR\u2013positive by sample type. animal selection and commingling Ten PI cattle (P1\u2013P10; obtained from multiple feedlots in southwest Kansas) were chosen for the commingle study. the BVDV-positive status of all 10 PI cattle was confirmed several weeks prior to commingling and again 2 wk prior to commingling. the BVDV-positive status was also reaffirmed on the day of their arrival (d-1) by VI on buffy coats and nasal swab, and by RT-rtPCR with kit B on buffy coat, serum, and nasal swabs samples collected on d-1 and again on the last day of animals from multiple geographic locations across the united states received a single prophylactic dose (1.5 mL/45 kg) of ceftiofur crystalline free acid (excede, Pfizer Animal Health, New York, NY) all non-PI cattle, on d-1, received a single prophylactic dose (1.5 mL/45 kg) of ceftiofur crystalline free acid. PI BVDV cattle were placed in a quarantine pen with no fence-line contact with non-PI cattle. the day after the non-PI cattle arrived, they were commingled with all PI cattle in a common study pen. animals with rectal temperatures 40\u00b0C were treated with a subcutaneous dose of enrofloxacin. RNA recovery RNA was recovered from serum (50 L), buffy coats (100 L), nasal swabs (100 L), and ear notch samples. a magnetic bead-based nucleic acid extraction method was used to recover viral RNA following manufacturer\u2019s instructions. RT-rtPCR data analysis was performed using the real-time PCR instrument\u2019s software. the threshold is set at 10% of the final signal for the positive controls. the results were then evaluated, and interpretations were made. the BVDV NY-1 strain from KSVDL was used as the positive control. the plates were washed with 1 PBS (pH 7.4), fixed with 80% aqueous acetone. the plates were stained with -BVDV antibody (Bovine viral diarrhea virus monoclonal antibody [D89], VMRD, Pullman, WA) inactivated serum were mixed with a constant quantity of the indicator BVDV (50\u2013300 TCID50), incubated (1 h, 37\u00b0C), and 0.1 mL inoculated onto a monolayer of 1-d-old MDBK cells. cultures were incubated (3 d, 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2) then fixed (room temperature, 15 min) in 80% aqueous acetone. titers were calculated using the specific titer of all non-PI cattle on d-1 (prior to commingling) to the 6 BVDV indicator viruses described previously. non-PI cattle whole blood buffy coat samples collected on d+8, d+13, or d+20 were processed for 5\u2032-UTR sequence analysis. resulting PCR product was diluted to the desired concentration and sequenced from both ends using an outsourced sequencing facility. forward and reverse sequences were assembled, assembled sequences were aligned, and pair-wise comparisons showing the percent identities were generated. seven of the treated cattle were treated with enrofloxacin. this animal continued to be ill for the remainder of the study. autopsy and histologic examination at KSVDL revealed chronic-active necrosuppurative bronchopneumonia with fibrinous pleuritis. on d+8, 26% (14 of 53) of the non-PI cattle were VI positive for BVDV from buffy coats. BVDV RT-rtPCR from whole blood buffy coat, serum, nasal swabs, and ear notch samples were unsuccessful. animal 42 was the only animal that was RT-rtPCR negative on all buffy coat sampling dates after commingling. the RT-rtPCR assay for detection of viral RNA was conducted at 14 time points. the range of time points for which the cattle were positive for viral RNA ranged from 0 to 13. the average Ct for all positive ear notch samples was 37.1. seventeen non-PI cattle were identified as RT-rtPCR suspect-positive on ear notch samples. none of the cattle were found to be RT-rtPCR suspect-positive on all 3 ear notch sampling dates. buffy coat lysates from d+8 indicated 38 cattle were infected with a single strain of virus. d+20 RT-rtPCR positive and suspect-positive cattle showed that 20 animals were infected with a single BVDV strain, 8 cattle were infected with >1 BVDV strain, 6 cattle had 1 strain defined but had undefined evidence of mixed infections. BVDV-2a was the most frequently detected genotype in exposed non-PI cattle.

BVDV-1b strains from PI cattle were detected in 12 non-PI cattle. Sequences for BVDV-1b strains from PI-8, PI-1, and PI-4 were undetected in buffy coat samples (d+8, d+13, or d+20) from any of the non-PI cattle. 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 the presence of the \u201cnovel\u201d BVDV-1b strain continued to be detected in all 5 cattle through d+7. animal 41 demonstrated the \u201cnovel\u201d BVDV-1b through d+6. animal 49 was suspected of being infected with the \u201cnovel\u201d BVDV-1b strain early in the study, similar to animal 41. cattle that began the study with higher BVDV VN titers to the BVDV indicator viruses showed either a lack of detectable BVDV infection during the commingle period as interpreted by BVDV RT-rtPCR. a lower level of detectable BVDV, as indicated by higher average Ct values generated from buffy coat samples over all the PCR test days, could also be correlated to an elevated d-1 VN GMT. animal 42 had a d-1 VN GMT of 574.7 as measured against 6 BVDV indicator viruses. 4 cattle (6, 18, 25, 43) had d-1 VN GMTs of 128\u2013287. each was PCR positive from a buffy coat sample on only a single PCR test date. the average number of test days that cattle were PCR positive for BVDV was 7.7. the severity and duration of a BVDV infection have been shown to be proportional to the levels of VN antibodies against BVDV. calves with passively acquired BVDV VN titers of 8 developed severe clinical disease. RT-rtPCR results were higher with nasal swabs (18%) than with either buffy coat (8%) or serum samples (7%). acute mixed BVDV infections have been demonstrated in natural22,26,42 and experimental infections7,25,32. single and various combinations of mixed infections were observed between different genotypes (BVDV-1 and BVDV-2a), subgenotypes (BVDV-1a and BVDV-1b) or different strains within a subgenotype. BVDV-2a appeared to be the predominant subgenotype infecting the non-PI cattle. a BVDV-1b strain, referred to as the \u201cnovel\u201d BVDV-1b strain, was detected in 8 non-PI cattle on the 3 sampling dates selected for 5\u2032-UTR sequencing. a transmission chain of acute BVDV infections was identified on d+8, d+13, and d+20 in other non-PI cattle."}
