{"summary": "two classes of antiinfluenza drugs, the M2 and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors, are currently approved in many countries. one of the primary issues for existing influenza antivirals is the constant threat of the emergence of viruses resistant to the limited number of approved drugs. the lack of drug options with different mechanisms of action has magnified the risk of widespread antiviral resistance developing to the limited treatment options currently available. no formulation for intravenous delivery of NA inhibitors has been approved in the united states which limits treatment options for patients on ventilators. two NA inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) were licensed in the united states. an IVadministered NA inhibitor (peramivir) was in phase I clinical development 20. a virus polymerase inhibitor (T705) was in preclinical development 21. include a small molecule, an antisense oligonucleotide, a peptide and a monoclonal antibody inhibiting novel virus targets. EV077 indirectly inhibits virus replication by inhibiting the increase of prostanoids associated with influenza virus infection. 27 Compounds targeting host factors also offer the potential for broadspectrum antiviral activity. oseltamivir resistance in seasonal H1N1 viruses circulating in the united states shifted from 1% in the 2006/2007 season to >95% by the 2008/2009 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. some states reporting >5% resistance during the 2010/2011 season. sales during most influenza seasons have been low, especially compared with other pharmaceutical products. sales during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic increased dramatically and challenged production capacity. challenges to more widespread use of influenza antivirals include the need to treat within 48 hours of symptom development. ical Advanced Research and Development Authority has spent over 450 million dollars to date to the advanced development of new antivirals. successful development of these drugs to final regulatory approval will serve to broaden the arsenal for treating all age groups and special populations. bright R, Shay D, Shu B, Cox N, Klimox A.
