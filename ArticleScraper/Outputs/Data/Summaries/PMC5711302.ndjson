{"summary": "Applied public health research refers to activities that generate data to answer a research question; test a hypothesis; evaluate a program or programmatic element. surveillance refers to activities that collect health-related data in a systematic manner over time to inform public health action. current GDD Program projects incorporate multiple core activities. activities do not sum across the rows because activity types are not mutually exclusive. the 10 GDD regional centers engaged in 205 discrete projects during October 2014\u2013September 2016. the variability in the range of topical areas was attributable to a combination of factors, including the epidemiology of the disease (nationally and globally); available funding; the technical capacity at the local level. of 205 projects with a defined topical area, 24% (n = 50) were focused on acute respiratory illness (Table 2). 0 2 19 Vectorborne infections (e.g., malaria, dengue, Japanese encephalitis, Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever) 12 5 5 7 4 5 Hospital-associated infections Healthcare infection and control 9 5 4 4 1 4 Tuberculosis Tuberculosis, case findings, control, and treatment 9 7 1 5 4 3 Enteric disease Diarrheal diseases or infection 8 3 6 6 6 Antimicrobial resistance Antimicrobial drug\u2013resistant pathogens 6 high-intensity interventions for Nipah-like illness and low-intensity interventions for routine use in Bangladesh X X X surveillance impacting public health interventions X X X Spatial heterogeneity for dengue risk in Bangladesh X X Risk factors for Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection in a southern coastal region in china X X X Egypt National surveillance of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in Egypt X X X Ricke bekistan to combat antimicrobial resistance X X Implementation of the CCHF surveillance enhancement activities in Kazakhstan, 2012\u20132015 X X Kenya Epidemiology of brucellosis and MERS-CoV in linked human and animal populations in Kenya X X X Indirect effects of 10-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV10) against adult pneumococcal pneumonia in rural western Kenya X X X South Africa Application of a simple differential diagnostic tool GDD regional centers partner with host countries to develop and strengthen surveillance for key illnesses and to limit spread of disease to the point of origin. population-based surveillance provides a framework for applied public health research that can characterize the burden, risk factors, and transmission characteristics of emerging infectious diseases. in 2014, the GDD regional centers began efforts to link common acute febrile illness (AFI) syndromic surveillance strategies across 5 regional sites to gain a global perspective on AFI. no international consensus case definition exists for AFI surveillance, although recommendations for improving methods have been proposed. GDD works with partner countries to strengthen diagnostic technical capacity for priority diseases; evaluate new laboratory diagnostics; establish frameworks for national laboratories. research at the GDD regional centers has assisted in detection and identification of 12 novel strains and pathogens that were new to the world. Applied public health research and epidemiologic studies in international settings can address important knowledge gaps in infectious disease issues. many of these issues would be difficult to examine in the united states, primarily because of low prevalence of many infectious diseases. associated infections surveillance system evaluation in Beijing X X Risk factors for Vibrio parahaemolyticus infection in a southern coastal region in china X X Egypt National surveillance of healthcare-associated infections and antimicrobial resistance in Egypt X X X Overview of GDD Egypt\u2019s population-based syndromic surveillance\u2014Damanhur, Egypt, 2009\u20132016 X X X Rickettsia typhi as an underrecognized cause of acute X X Decline in syphilis seroprevalence among females of reproductive age in southern Africa X X Decline in syphilis seroprevalence among females of reproductive age in rural Thailand X X Enhanced surveillance for severe pneumonia, Thailand 2010\u20132014 X X Epidemiology and antimicrobial resistance of invasive salmonellosis. population-based surveillance provides a framework for applied public health research. establishing population-based infectious disease surveillance for pneumonia and acute respiratory infections was a primary goal of the GDD Program (3). no international consensus case definition exists for AFI surveillance. of 169 studies aiming to identify etiology, only 6 (4%) had enrolled cases in multiple countries. a multisite research effort has the potential to catalyze historically disparate AFI syndromic surveillance systems toward globally comparable data of high utility at all levels. research at the GDD regional centers has assisted in the detection and identification of 12 novel strains and pathogens that were new to the world. 62 novel strains or pathogens that were new to the region where they were discovered (9) international projects that address a common threat, such as infectious diseases that easily cross borders, can open avenues of communication and ease tensions between the United States and other nations. GDD China serves as an example of how 2 strong national public health institutes (1 in China and 1 in the United States) can collaborate and benefit. the GDD regional centers and the countries they work with have the tools needed to best characterize pathogens that are circulating. increased informatics capacity is concurrently enabling the active linkage of information and interfacing of data housed in multiple data systems. can be detected and stopped faster and closer to the source, thereby enhancing global health security."}
