{"summary": "hepatitis C is a major health burden that can lead to chronic liver disease, often resulting in cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. the virus is transmitted through percutaneous routes and by unsafe injections with HCV-contaminated needles. hepatocytes comprise 60% of the total liver cells and are the main contributor to liver functions. the low density of viral particles is due to their association with very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) or low-density lipoproteins (LDL) to form the so-called lipoviroparticles (LVP) lipoprotein components have also been found in LVP. a robust cell culture model with appropriate polarization properties to study HCV is still lacking. it has been known for a long time that HepG2 cells exhibit polarization properties. clones of HepG2 cells have been isolated that can polarize with a simple columnar morphology. medium supplemented with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) we monitored the amounts of HSA and apoE secreted in the basolateral chamber over time to test the functionality of cell polarization. in the first group, two clones, 15 and 1SC3, secreted high levels of HSA (>80%) for 12 days before the monolayer started to age and the basolateral secretion of HSA decreased. rin receptor with a hemagglutinin (HA-TfR) tag (HA-TfR) in the extracellular domain was expressed, and its cell surface expression was analyzed. in Fig. 2C are depicted the z sections displayed in column 1, 2, and 3 of Fig. 2A and B. the cells were fixed 6 days after inducing polarization and processed for membrane staining of CD26 (A) and HA (B), followed by permeabilization and staining of the ZO-1 tight-junction protein and nuclei with DAPI. x-z projections of the cells stained for CD26 and ZO-1 and TfR and ZO-1 are shown in green, ZO-1 in red, and nuclei in blue. 5.45 0.19 log10 FFU/ml was measured in Huh-7 cells using the same stock of HCV grown in cell culture (HCVcc) clones 15 and 1SC3 showed a 1.5 log10 decrease in susceptibility to HCV infection compared to Huh-7 cells. expression of miR122 in these two clones was confirmed by reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. polarized clones are thought to cross the fenestrated endothelium to enter the space of Disse. however, it has never been proved experimentally that HCV infects cells at the basolateral domain. polarization of cells on semipermeable supports offers the advantage of having independent access to the different poles of the cells. polarized cells were infected either at the basolateral or at the apical domain. polarized cells were infected with a recombinant HCoV-229E expressing Renilla luciferase. at 6 h postinfection, the cells were lysed and luciferase activities were quantified. polarized or nonpolarized cells were measured by quantitative RT-PCR. heparin inhibited apical as well as basolateral binding of the virus. the same experiment was performed in the presence of heparin. polarized clone 15 cells were transduced with lentiviral expression vector for SR-BI (A), CD81-GFP (B), CLDN1-Cer (C), or OCLN-GFP (D) the cells were fixed and processed for cell surface staining of SR-BI. z stacks of xy sections of the cells were acquired by confocal microscopy. newly synthesized progeny virus is preferentially released from polarized clone 15 and 1SC3 cells were infected at the basolateral membrane; 48 h later, apical and basolateral supernatants were collected and infectious titers were determined. the results are expressed as percentages of the total secreted virus. low-density viral particles are secreted from polarized cells. the density of virions produced in vivo is lower than that of viral particles generated in hepatocytic cell lines (21), indicating cell culture systems do not recapitulate the production of fully mature viral particles. polarization combined with OA and U0126 treatment promotes the formation of LVP of lower density. clones were grown on semipermeable supports in a medium supplemented with 1% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in the first group, two clones secreted high levels of HSA for 12 days before the monolayer started to age. the total amount of HSA secreted by these clones increased until day 12 before reaching a plateau. the other clones presented a weaker level of polarization, with secretion of HSA below 70%. CD26 was found on the uppermost cell surface (Fig. 2A and D, x-z projection) but was not detected on the cell surface below the tight junctions. the transferrin receptor was detected only on the basolateral membrane surface. similar results were obtained with clone 15 (data not shown) polarized clones 15 and 1SC3 grown on semipermeable supports have the morphology of epithelial cells. polarization of the cells was optimal between days 5 and 10 after induction of polarization. expression of miR122 in these two clones was confirmed by quantitative real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR. in the parental cell line, HepG2-CD81, miR122 was detectable, but its relative expression level compared to Huh-7 cells was very low (0.3%) as expected, we could not detect any miR122 expression in HEK293T cells. in control nonpolarized cells, HCV could infect cells equally from both domains. in polarized cells, HCV predominantly infected cells when administered at the basolateral domain. same experiment was performed in presence of 1 nM daclatasvir. polarized cells were infected at the apical or basolateral domain with a recombinant HCoV-229E expressing Renilla luciferase. at 6 h postinfection, the cells were lysed and luciferase activities were quantified. polarized cells (clones 15 and 1SC3) and nonpolarized cells (clone 1SC3) were incubated with purified virions at 4\u00b0C for 2 h at the apical or basolateral domain. the cells were lysed and total RNAs were extracted. polarized clone 15 cells were transduced with lentiviral expression vector for SR-BI (A), CD81-GFP (B), CLDN1-Cer (C), or OCLN-GFP (D) the cells were fixed and processed for cell surface staining of SR-BI. the cells were fixed and stained for cell surface staining of SR-BI. z stacks of xy sections of the cells were acquired by confocal micro more than 90% of HCV particles were secreted from the basolateral pole. only 2.3 0.22 and 2.1 0.31 log10 FFU/ml were produced in the apical chamber. the release of HCV genome parallels that of infectious particles. a suitable cellular model to study the detailed mechanisms of VLDL and LVP formation is still lacking. it has recently been shown that HepG2 treatment with oleic acid (OA) can stimulate the production of VLDL, but without affecting the density of secreted HCV particles (22) in untreated polarized cells, the density profile of secreted virions was the same as that of HCV particles released from nonpolarized cells. basolateral supernatants were collected and separated on an iodixanol buoyant-density gradient. the error bars indicate the SEM of the results of three independent experiments. this is due to the specific polarization structures of hepatocytes. this is due to the specific polarization structures of hepatocytes. culture models have been developed to address the role of hepatocyte polarity. first, when they are grown in rotating-wall vessels that stimulate microgravity, Huh-7 cells are able to form multilayers. but without forming bile canaliculus-like structures, the formation of canaliculus-like structures has been observed in spheroids. infectivities of 4.06 0.19 and 4.19 0.13 log10 FFU/ml were observed in clone 15 and clone 1SC3 respectively, compared to 5.45 0.19 in Huh-7 cells. clone 1SC3 showed lower infectivity, suggesting other factors, such as HCV (co)receptor expression, may account for the differences observed. HCV preferentially infects cells from the apical domain of the cells. this difference likely results from the use of cell lines with different origins. in polarized epithelial cells, CD81 is localized at the basolateral membrane of the cells. coxsackievirus B virus infects enterocytes via internalization at tight junctions. polarized HepG2-CD81 cells release HCV particles with lower density. polarization of cells modifies intracellular trafficking. hepG2-CD81 cell culture system provides a unique model to decipher the interplay between HCV infection and cell polarization. this simple polarized cell culture model also provides the opportunity to produce and characterize viral particles that exhibit biophysical properties similar to those of patient virus. the virus used in this study was engineered to reconstitute the A4 epitope in E1 (33) with titer-enhancing mutations (34). highly infectious viral supernatants were collected and cleared by centrifugation. pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of cold phosphate-buffered saline. gradients were ultracentrifuged for 16 h at 160,000 g at 4\u00b0C in an SW41 rotor. supernatants were centrifuged for 1 min at 2,000 rpm to remove cell debris. apoE secretion was quantified at days 6 and 9 after inducing polarization by using a human apoE ELISA kit. pTRIP-CD81-GFP, pTRIP-SRBI, and pTRIP-cerulean-CD81 were described previously. polarized cells were transduced by adding lentivirus to the apical chamber for 2 h. at day 5 after polarization induction, the cells were transduced by adding lentivirus to the apical chamber for 2 h. the cells were fixed and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS. total cellular RNA was extracted from confluent cells using a mirVana miRNA isolation kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. at day 5 after polarization induction, cells were infected by incubating the virus either at the basolateral domain or at the apical domain for 1 h at 37\u00b0C at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.25. purified virus was diluted in cold DMEM-HEPES (DMEM without bicarbonate containing 25 mM HEPES buffer) the cells were washed with cold PBS on ice, and total cell RNAs were extracted by using a Nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) as recommended by the manufacturer. the cells were washed, and fresh polarization medium was added to both chambers. the basolateral media of 3 transwells for each condition were collected 24 h later and pooled before loading on a 10 to 50% iodixanol gradient. for nonpolarized cells, clone 15 cells or Huh-7 cells were infected. based on the JFH1 strain engineered to reconstitute the A4 epitope in E1 (33) with titer-enhancing mutations (34). Plasmids carrying the full-length genome were digested with XbaI. in vitro transcriptions were performed using a Megascript kit (Ambion) pTRIP-CD81-GFP, pTRIP-SRBI, and pTRIP-cerulean-CD81 were constructed by excision of the mCherry-CD81 coding sequence in pTRIP-mcherry-CD81 between the NheI and XhoI sites. maximum cell polarity was achieved between days 5 and 10. lentivirus stocks were transfected with 500 ng of pTRIP vector, 400 ng gag-pol expressing vector, and 100 ng of vesicular stomatitis virus. cells were washed, and fresh polarization medium was added to each chamber. polarized cells were fixed and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100 diluted in PBS. the cells were washed, and the permeable membranes were mounted between a coverslip and a slide with 4-88 Mowiol-based mounting medium. for membrane staining of HA-TfR and SR-BI, fixed cells were blocked in 10% goat serum in PBS and incubated with anti-HA or anti-SR-BI diluted in blocking buffer for 30 min prior to permeabilization. then, the cells were permeabilized and further processed for staining of at 30 h postinfection, total cellular RNA was extracted by using the Nucleospin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) as recommended by the manufacturer. hed and fresh polarization medium with or without 1 nM daclatasvir was added in both chambers. RNAs were extracted using a QIAamp viral RNA kit (Qiagen) to measure HCV genomes in each supernatant. polarized cells grown on transwell plates were infected by incubating the virus at the basolateral domain for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. twenty-four hours later, the medium was replaced with polarization medium."}
