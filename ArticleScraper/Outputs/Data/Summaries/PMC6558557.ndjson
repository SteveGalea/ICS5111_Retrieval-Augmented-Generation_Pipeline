{"summary": "emerging infectious diseases are a constant threat to public health worldwide. several major outbreaks have been potent reminders of the need for robust surveillance systems and timely responses to nascent epidemics. despite the lessons learned, the recent (2018) EVD outbreaks in Democratic Republic of the Congo are a stark reminder that a large number of these challenges remain. outbreak analytics sits at the crossroads of public health planning, field epidemiology, methodological development and information technologies. we focus on how different analysis components interact within functional workflows and how each component can be used to inform different stages of an outbreak response. analysis needs to diversify as the intervention progresses. new questions may arise to inform the implementation of control and mitigation measures. assessing transmissibility, mortality and risk factors remain key throughout the intervention. the post-intervention phase lends itself to retrospective studies, which can assess further the impact of interventions [60], tease apart finer processes driving the epidemic dynamics [12,61], study risk factors [54,62], identify avenues for fortifying surveillance [13,36,63] and evaluate, improve and develop modelling techniques [28,64,65]. 'outbreak data' encompasses different types of information, of which we first distinguish \u2018case data\u2019 from \u2018background data\u2019. the detection stage starts with the first case and ends with the first intervention activities (e.g. patient isolation, contact tracing, vaccination) the early response is the initial part of the intervention, essentially centred around estimating transmissibility. the post-intervention stage is for lessons to be learned, for improving preparedness for the next epidemic and for training and capacity building [39] outbreak response analytics may be best focused on informing and monitoring core surveillance activities and performance indicators, such as contact tracing [11], mapping [53,54] and analysis pipelines integrating mobile data collection tools [18,19,55,56] with automated reporting systems [57\u201359]. 'outbreak data' encompasses different types of information, of which we first distinguish \u2018case data\u2019 from \u2018background data\u2019. a final type of data we consider here is \u2018intervention data\u2019, which refers to information on decisions made and efforts deployed as part of the intervention, such as vaccination coverage, the extent of active case finding or potential changes in the epidemiological case definition. the collection of epidemiological data Tools for data capture have become a focus of much discussion in recent years. in resource-limited settings, epidemiological data are still often collected with pen and paper. there are some downsides to using paper as a data management tool, becoming increasingly important with larger outbreaks. the epidemic curve (epicurve) shows case incidence time series as a histogram of new onset dates for a given time interval [83\u201385] maps have been at the core of infectious disease epidemiology from a very early stage [87]. a last essential source of data is contact data [20], which includes data on case exposure [12] as well as contact tracing, where appropriate [11,63]. a last essential source of data is contact data [20], which includes data on case exposure [12] as well as contact tracing, where appropriate [11,63]. some metrics, such as transmissibility, require the use of statistical or mathematical models in order to be estimated. other useful statistics can be readily computed from linelists, including different demographic indicators of the reported cases (e.g. gender, age, occupation [7,100,101] or case delays such as the times to hospitalization, recovery or death, reported as a whole [1,7,8] or stratified by groups [100,101]. r is estimated from a simple model where case incidence is either exponentially growing (r > 0) or declining (r 0) the growth rate can also be used to estimate the doubling and halving times of the epidemic. r quantifies the speed at which a disease spreads, but does not contain information on the level of the intervention necessary to control a disease. the value of R can also be used to calculate the fraction of the population that needs to be immunized in order to contain an outbreak. different methodological approaches have been developed to estimate the reproduction number. the formula will depend on the type of model used, but such estimation will usually require that different rates are known or estimated by fitting the model to data [104,107] methods that have been developed and applied in other fields are only rarely applied in infectious disease epidemiology. the most appropriate method ultimately depends on the particular epidemiological setting, existing knowledge of the transmission dynamics and data availability. mechanistic or simulation models aim to include a more explicit representation of the different factors that might influence transmission. observational studies may be undertaken early on in the intervention phase. they can help identify ongoing infection sources of environmental, food-borne or water-borne nature. in longer-running outbreaks, they can provide insights into opportunities for control [53,115,118] and to stop the outbreak at its source. phylogenies can be used to assess origins of a set of pathogens [138], patterns of geographical spread [125], host species jumps [139,140], past fluctuations in the pathogen population sizes [141] and even, in some cases, the reproduction number [1]. a further step towards integrating WGS alongside epidemiological data is the reconstruction of transmission trees (who infects whom) using evidence synthesis approaches. analysis pipelines used during recent epidemics of pandemic influenza [1], MERS-CoV [4] and EVD [7,8,17] may focus on traceback data. vector-borne disease analysis may focus heavily on modelling the vector's ecological niche [70,71] EDC can reduce delay between data collection, centralization and analysis. real-time, automated centralization, data analysis and reporting can be built into the platform. maintaining confidentiality and privacy is a legitimate concern whenever data concerning human subjects are collected. free and crowd-sourced [90] geographical data provide layers of spatial data that include information on the location of households and health facilities, among other determinants. a last essential source of data is contact data [20], which includes data on case exposure [12] as well as contact data [20], which includes data on case exposure [12]. tracing, where appropriate, can yield valuable insights into \u2018paired delays\u2019 (figure 2). the serial interval (time between onsets of a case and their infector) or generation time (time between the dates of infections of a case and their infector) [7,8], which are in turn useful for estimating transmissibility [27,28,96,97] a first measure of transmissibility is the growth rate (r), which is estimated from a simple model where case incidence is either exponentially growing (r > 0) or declining (r 0) the growth rate can also be used to estimate the doubling and halving times of the epidemic, i.e. the time during which incidence doubles (respectively is halved), as alternative metrics of transmission. reproduction number (here generically noted \u2018R\u2019) measures the average number of secondary cases caused by each primary case. current reproduction number determines the dynamics of the epidemic in the near future, with values greater than 1 predicting an increase in cases, and less than 1 predicting control. branching process models are usually much simpler to fit to data than their compartmental counterparts. it is often essential to forecast future incidence for advocacy and planning purposes. despite the growing body of research focusing on predicting incidence during epidemics, there are currently no gold standards. studies are conducted during the intervention and post-intervention phases of an outbreak response. they include retrospective cohort and case\u2013control studies to identify risk factors and quantify associations between potential causes and their outcomes. these studies reside outside of the normal scope of outbreak response activities, being inserted ad hoc as functions. lecular epidemiology methods have been used extensively for defining strains of related isolates [32,129], which can be used to infer various features of the pathogens sampled. these methods usually exploit only a fraction of the information contained within pathogens' genomes, as they rely on genetic variation in a limited number of housekeeping genes [32,129]. phylogenies can be used to assess the origins of a set of pathogens [138], patterns of geographical spread [125], the reconstruction of transmission trees is a difficult and computationally intensive problem. first, most diseases do not accumulate sufficient genetic diversity during the course of an outbreak to allow the accurate reconstruction of transmission chains. the complex nature of the problem requires the use of Bayesian methods for model fitting. this new field will face in the coming years. 'background data' can be gathered and shared outside of epidemic context. data on the natural histories of diseases derived from past epidemics can form a useful substitute to real-time estimates. crowd-sourced initiatives are promising and have been used successfully in low resource settings [90], more efforts are needed to collate and curate open data sources. outbreak analytics will likely occupy an increasing space in field epidemiology over the years to come. authors' contributions T.J. drafted the outline of the review and revised the manuscript. authors' contributions T.J. wrote the first draft of the manuscript. the authors alone are responsible for the views expressed in this article and do not necessarily represent the views, decisions or policies of the institutions with which they are affiliated."}
