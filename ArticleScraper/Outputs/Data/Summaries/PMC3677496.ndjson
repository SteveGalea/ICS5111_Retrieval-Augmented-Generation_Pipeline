{"summary": "lacy mutant was incorporated into liposomes in which PE content was varied from 0% to 70% (i.e., to the wild-type level) the normally cytoplasmically exposed domains NT and C6 face the exterior of proteoliposomes. the normally periplasmically exposed domain P7 (periplasmic domain 7; Fig. 1) faces the interior of the proteoliposomes as previously established (16, 17) proteoliposomes were treated with the membrane impermeable sulfhydryl reagent (N-maleimidopropionyl) biocytin (MPB) followed by separation of proteins by SDS/polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. biotinylated LacY was visualized after transfer of the separated proteins to a solid support followed by reaction with avidin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Western blot) methyl-cyclodextrin (MCD) was demonstrated to facilitate the exchange of phospholipids between the outer monolayers of donor multilamellar lipid vesicles (MLVs) and recipient small unilamellar vesicles (liposomes) without bilayer fusion or disruption of bilayer integrity. proteoliposomes of either 70% or 50% PE relative to PG plus CL or 100% PG plus CL were made containing C liposomes lacking LacY using immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) specific for the C-terminal His6 tag of LacY with total recovery of LacY ranging from 83% to 97% for each LacY single-cysteine derivative. phospholipid composition of proteoliposomes was analyzed before and after incubation with MLVs. representative TLC analysis of lipids from indicated LacY proteoliposomes. orientation of domains NT, C6, or P7 was assessed before and after lipid exchange. proteoliposomes remained 100% protected inside proteoliposomes unless detergent was added. similar result was observed for the cysteine in domain NT but with starting and ending determinations showing slightly less exposed cysteine. effect of change in PE content on orientation of domains C6, P7, or NT of LacY in proteoliposomes subjected to lipid exchange. inducing lipid exchange with MCD at 37 \u00b0C instead of 55 \u00b0C gave the same results as in Fig. 3. neither the lipid exchange process itself nor high temperature alone resulted in topological switching. results mirror results seen in vivo when LacY was first assembled either in the absence of PE or at various levels of PE. lacy-containing proteoliposomes were recovered by IMAC followed by solubilization with 2% -d-d-d-dodecylmaltoside and overnight IP with either the conformation-. mAb 4B1 showed increased or decreased recognition by mAb 4B1 after introduction or dilution of PE. mAb 4B1 (ratio 4B1/I, dark gray bars) indicates total amount of LacY in proteoliposomes before IP. pAb 1043 indicates total recovery with mAb 4B1 (ratio 4B1/I, dark gray bars) cytoplasmically exposed domains NT and C6 face the exterior of proteoliposomes. the normally periplasmically exposed domain P7 (periplasmic domain 7; Fig. 1) faces the interior of the proteoliposomes as previously established (16, 17) lacy inversion in liposomes is inversely proportional to PE level at intermediate levels of PE. the external accessibility of the C6 domain (native topology) was greater than the NT domain at each intermediate PE level. these results support two conclusions that could not be made based solely on in vivo observations. proteoliposomes were mixed with MCD-treated MLVs of 100% PG plus CL in the first two cases. the initial result is generation of asymmetric lipid bilayers. increasing exchange of lipids between bilayer leaflets occurs with lipids containing unsaturated fatty acids. lipid composition of proteoliposomes containing LacY was assessed before and after lipid exchange. the orientation of domains NT, C6, or P7 was assessed. the orientation of domains NT, C6, or P7 was assessed. proteoliposomes remained intact and impermeable to sulfhydryl reagents before and after lipid exchange. reducing PE content from 70% to 40% changed the 100% or 95% of domain C6 of LacY in its native orientation. TM orientation is summarized for LacY in proteoliposomes containing 0% (Left), intermediate (Center) or 70% (Right) PE. no change in topological orientation of TMs occurred after lipid exchange between proteoliposomes and MLVs of the same lipid composition. synthesis to wild-type levels or a reduction of PE levels to 5% respectively. postassembly bidirectional changes in TM orientation can be thermodynamically driven and determined by direct lipid interactions that are governed by the inherent properties of the protein and its lipid environment. effects of dynamic changes in PE content on folding of the 4B1 epitope (domain P7) of LacY reconstituted in liposomes. proteoliposomes were subjected to lipid exchange as described in Fig. 2. a completely in vitro system of reconstitution of LacY into liposomes of varied lipid composition followed by MCD-mediated lipid exchange (23, 24) to determine the minimal and sufficient requirements first to establish initial uniform or multiple topological organization. the unique findings of the present work have several important implications, which are summarized as follows. membrane protein topological organization (either uniform or as multiple conformers) at the time of initial membrane insertion, during initial folding or after folding into a compact structure is directly determined by the innate properties of the protein and its lipid environment independent of any other cellular factors. reversibility of topological orientation independent of other cellular factors indicates a thermodynamically driven process that can occur at any time and in any cell membrane. the topological organization of a bull sperm Na+/K+ ATPase is dependent on the cholesterol and sphingolipid composition after reconstitution into proteoliposome-mimicking events. the dynamic property of TM orientation explains how late appearing topogenic signals can influence the topological organization of previously inserted TMs. in vitro results fully mirror in vivo results, the lipid-exchange reconstitution system provides the means to study the detailed mechanism of lipid-dependent postassembly changes in protein structure. membrane protein insertion and topogenesis may not be solely thermodynamically driven in vivo. posttranslational reorientation of eukaryotic, bacterial, and viral membrane proteins is not unprecedented. translocon cannot be involved in postinsertional changes in protein structure and function such as movement in and out of lipid rafts or changes occurring during intracellular protein trafficking. Co(II)-Talon Superflow resin (IMAC) was used to purify LacY as previously described (16) Purified LacY was reconstituted into liposomes (16) followed by changing the lipid composition by exchange with MLVs with a different lipid composition in the presence of MCD."}
