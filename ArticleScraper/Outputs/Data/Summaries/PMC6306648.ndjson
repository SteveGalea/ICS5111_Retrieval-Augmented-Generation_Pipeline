{"summary": "the argument for the rarity of natural global catastrophic biological risks can be formulated to provide a revised estimate about the probability of natural pandemics. the argument for the rarity of natural global catastrophic biological risks (GCBRs) can be formulated to provide a revised estimate about the probability of natural pandemics. anthropic shadows exist when an anthropic bias leads to a situation in which \"the frequencies of catastrophes that destroy or are otherwise incompatible with the existence of observers are systematically underestimated\" our argument requires further restricting the definition to events caused by a naturally occurring pathogen. this type of expert elicitation is limited,9,15 but only the latter case is plausibly sufficient to directly affect the course of civilization. our model will therefore address the question of the probability that a naturally occurring disease kills or otherwise incapacitates more than 1 billion people. we want to estimate the portion of the joint distribution p(emergence, disease, impact) where more than 1 billion people are disabled or killed. emergence of diseases with a given level of impact, p(emergence|impact, data), where the data are known events of this type. this evidence can also inform p(disease, emergence), the relative rate at which disease with various characteristics and etiologies emerge. models and expert understanding can be used to estimate the probability that a given disease that could emerge becomes a GCBR. etiologies or characteristics make a disease likely to become a GCBR. how likely are high-fatality and high-risk events from a given disease. how effective are containment and risk-mitigation regimes\" p(emergence|impact) depends heavily on human behavior and is nonconstant. p(emergence|impact) can be considered in part on the basis of observable historical events with known impacts. p(emergence|impact) can be considered in part on the basis of observable historical events with known impacts. incomplete historical records can create sampling biases. the recording of historical infectious diseases depends on the observation process. this method relies on observations, without accounting for the seismological underlying process generating those observations. only 7,000 years have elapsed since the earliest written records. there is a clear cultural and linguistic bias in historically preserved records. naive estimates can still be adjusted on the basis of the true data-generating process. a list-based historical approach is unlikely to uncover new threats, but we suggest it might still be useful for finding the historical rate of emergence of such threats. they also consider bacteria\u2014especially antibiotic-resistant bacteria\u2014prionic diseases, and protozoa. p(emergence|impact) can be considered in part on the basis of observable historical events with known impacts. Observer effects and anthropic shadows Cirkovic, Sandberg, and Bostrom11 do not discuss pandemics in their article introducing anthropic shadows. a lack of near misses may be evidence that such an anthropic shadow exists. tohoku was magnitude 9.1; tohoku was magnitude 9.1. we first consider p(emergence|impact, data) as an indicative example, we consider the plague, Yersinia pestis, which killed around half of the population. etiologies and mechanisms of spread from historical diseases are therefore useful evidence about what new diseases are most likely to emerge naturally. a list-based historical approach is unlikely to uncover new threats, but it might still be useful for finding the historical rate of emergence of such threats. if only 25% of relevant events have been recorded, the rate should be 4 times that found in the sample. risome fact that fungal adaptation to heat may be enhanced over the coming decades by selection pressure due to global warming and natural disasters. the work of Adalja et al addresses the most likely candidates for a GCBR, corresponding to the maxima of p(disease|impact) the first and second of Inglesby's triad are reason to expect pathogens that would normally emerge earlier in human history or in animals would have larger or even global impacts. the second and third are reasons that disease emergence is more likely than was true historically. the balance of these impacts is both unclear and critically important. evidence for the effectiveness of global public health response is the record of halting the spread of disease, even if not immediately. this failure was tragic, but serves as evidence that a well-understood nascent GCBR could not spread without effective containment even after initial response fails. a virulent enough novel pathogen could infect a large portion of humanity well before vaccines become available. a pandemic event can be characterized into 1 of 3 main etiologies: robust events, where the pathogen is able to spread, or stealth events, where the spread is too rapid to be noticed. if we can estimate the rate at which events occur, the categorization may help us begin to characterize the probability of GCBR events based on historical data. if most new human pathogens are due to encroaching on new territories, we could expect the trend toward more diseases to eventually slow and reverse as humanity fills the ecosphere. if population density and travel frequency are more critical, we may see the emergence of new diseases accelerate over time, since the trend toward urbanization and interconnection seems likely to continue accelerating. a well-understood nascent GCBR could not spread without effective containment even after initial response fails. a virulent enough novel pathogen could infect a large portion of humanity well before vaccines become available. this suggests a multi-stage model of whether health systems will identify a nascent GCBR. we have seen some events of each type occur. we can specify what data can be used to estimate the probability of GCBR events based on historical data. we can consider various reference classes on which to base such an estimate. ancient records and density analyses of modern human diseases, their etiologies, and their impacts are less susceptible to biases due to the comprehensive data collection. a larger historical sample would include records since classical antiquity. this dataset may inform both disease emergence rates and the relationship between changing social and economic factors and disease emergence. no records of bubonic plague predate the 541 ad Plague of Justinian. it may be an example of initial pandemic emergence within the historical period. there are also non-Western sources of data about severe early human diseases. extirpated populations left no records, and it would be difficult to identify such events based on archaeological evidence. former pathogens would have emerged as virulent diseases, likely to damage the hosts, then become endemic before written human history. some evidence exists in form of normal or transient symbiotic microbiota and relatively benign parasites. the relationship between records of diseases and their emergence is a feature of the data-generating process that is significant but difficult to quantify. if unobserved extirpation occurs, the visible record will overestimate the relative proportion of near-miss extinction events. if unobserved extirpation occurs, the visible record will also overestimate the relative proportion of near-miss extinction events. a wealth of information is available, including etiologies, how the diseases emerged, how other animals served as reservoirs, and how the diseases were spread. Ray's analysis and partial catalogue of vertebrate extinctions also found several cases where significant epidemics and extinctions have been caused. ancient records and density analyses of modern human diseases, their etiologies, and their impacts are less susceptible to biases due to the comprehensive data collection. a larger historical sample would include records since the beginning of classical antiquity. this dataset may inform both disease emergence rates and the relationship between changing social and economic factors and disease emergence. cholera, which first became a pandemic in the 1800s, was seemingly identified in the Sushruta Samhita45 about 600 bce. there is also evidence in the Charaka Samhita,46 dating from early in the Common Era, of earlier epidemics in India of other types. the lack of diseases in early historical records is even less convincing evidence of their rarity. some evidence exists in the form of normal or transient symbiotic microbiota. modern humans are therefore adapted to surviving the modern versions of perhaps once\u2013highly lethal pathogens. some evidence for this thesis is the lack of historical reference to several hepatitides. if unobserved extirpation occurs, the visible record will overestimate the relative proportion of near-miss extinction events. a wealth of information is available, including etiologies, how the diseases emerged, how other animals served as reservoirs, and how the diseases were spread. chytridiomycosis has resulted in the extinction of a large variety of amphibian species. it is also worth noting that this multispecies disease is fungal, rather than viral. despite historical evidence, there remains significant uncertainty about the relationship between historical patterns and present risk. the observed historical rate is a useful guide to the present risk of natural pandemics only after adjusting for several difficult to quantify factors. historical data do provide a baseline for assessment, and data about nonhuman diseases can provide evidence about both the overall risk of disease emergence and the degree to which selection and anthropic concerns bias the historical evidence."}
