{"summary": "quantitative methods for analyzing outbreak data and estimating key parameters to characterize the spread of the outbreak often assume that the data collected is complete. results We show that when the proportion of cases reported is changing through the study period, the estimates of key epidemiological parameters are biased. this quantity may be time dependent; for example it can contract during the course of an epidemic as prevalence of the disease increases. other quantities of interest include the case fatality rate [10] and the attack rate in subpopulations, such as age groups. using a simulation study, we provide some theoretical results describing the impact on the estimation of the reproductive number. we compare these to estimates of R0 obtained using the method proposed by wallinga and Teunis (WT method) t = qtNt of the cases are observed, where qt 0. Therefore little changes in (1) and it can be shown that the likelihood becomes L ( R 0, p, q ) = t = 1 T e t t ( M t / q t ) ( M t / q t )! we consider two simple missingness patterns in this scenario. first let the missingness be constant, i.e. qt = q1 for t tc and qt = q2 for t >tc. second let qt = q1 for t tc and qt = q2 for t >tc. this is the likely scenario initially in the current H1N1 outbreak. number, R 0 and R 0 that make use of the observed numbers of cases denoted by Mt = M1, MT where R 0 = t = 1 T M t t = 1 T M t 1, R 0 = t = 1 T M t / q t t = 1 T M t 1 / q t 1. the Gamma distributed serial interval represents a disease with a mean of 2.21 days and variance, 2 of 0.89 with k = 4. we then apply four missingness schemes to each dataset. the second two schemes have the reporting fraction increase once 30 cases are accumulated. [15] has recently described a tendency of this method to overestimate the mean of the serial interval when the serial interval is short, such as in cases of influenza. therefore part of the effect seen could be attributed to this phenomena, but likely will be uniformly so. those surveyed, 615 cases were reported. some of these reported cases were from seasonal flu. data simulated assuming constant reporting fraction. rates of 39%, 58%, and 68% are 0.70, 0.53, and 0.40 respectively. in this scenario we let the reporting fraction follow a logistic function given by: q t = q 2 q 1 e x p. q1 and q2 are set to 0.4 and 0.9 respectively. we estimate the effective reproductive number Rt by allowing Rt to following a four parameter logistic distribution. the median of the estimates over the 1000 simulated datasets is shown for each scenario along with the interquartile range of estimates obtained. we consider two simple missingness patterns in this scenario. first let the missingness be constant, i.e. qt = q1 for all t. second let qt = q1 for t tc and qt = q2 for t >tc, where tc might correspond to a public health announcement or certain number of cases occurring so as to raise alarm of an epidemic. mt = M1, MT where R 0 = t = 1 T M t t = 1 T M t 1, R 0 = t = 1 T M t / q t t = 1 T M t 1 / q t 1. if qt = q1, t tc and qt = q2, t >tc then we overestimate R0 if nave. the Gamma distributed serial interval represents a disease with a mean of 8 days and variance of 16 days with k = 4. we then apply four missingness schemes to each dataset. the first two scenarios assume that the reporting fraction is constant through time. the second two schemes have the reporting fraction increase once 30 cases are accumulated. the first boxplot (All) in each frame shows results when all the data is used. each subsequent couplet shows results when missingness is correctly accounted for. the numbers on the axis denote the missingness scheme applied to the data. data simulated assuming constant reporting fraction. black curves are the simulated datasets. simulated assuming constant reporting fraction. the data simulated from these assumptions are shown in Figure 3. Varying reporting fraction We consider three additional scenarios where we allow the reporting fraction to vary through time. in this case we let the reporting fraction follow a logistic function given by: q t = q 2 q 1 e x p ( r t q 2 + q 1 ( e r t 1 ) where r describes the growth rate of the epidemic and is calculated at 0.19 in this scenario and q1 and we estimate the effective reproductive number Rt by allowing Rt to following a four parameter logistic distribution. the median of the estimates over the 1000 simulated datasets is shown for each scenario along with the interquartile range of estimates obtained. we also provide estimates obtained on the same data where all cases are assumed to be pH1N1 using the method described by Wallinga and Teunis [3] the data simulated from these assumptions are shown in Figure 3. Varying reporting fraction We consider three additional scenarios where we allow the reporting fraction to vary through time. in this case we let the reporting fraction follow a logistic function given by: q t = q 2 q 1 e x p ( r t q 2 + q 1 ) where r describes the growth rate of the epidemic and is calculated at 0.19 in this scenario and q1 and q2 are set to 0.4 and we estimate the effective reproductive number Rt by allowing Rt to following a four parameter logistic distribution. the median of the estimates over the 1000 simulated datasets is shown for each scenario along with the interquartile range of estimates obtained. 2.00) 2.15 (2.04, 2.47) 1.43 (1.27, 1.67) logistic 1.35 (1.32, 1.41) 2.11 (2.00, 2.22) 1.55 (1.35, 1.75) 58% 1.55 (1.46, 2.03) 2.25 (2.08, 2.49) 1.45 (1.23, 1.67) logistic 1.13 (1.12, 1.15) 1.80 (1.70, 1.90) 1.32 (1.09, 1.53) 68% 1.54 (1.46, 2.02) 2 (IQR) 25% pH1N1 Original 1.42 1.96 1.14 39% 1.74 (1.58, 2.14) 2.51 (2.29, 2.73) 1.21 (0.90, 1.49) logistic 1.44 (1.35, 1.54) 2.38 (2.19, 2.60) 1.32 (1.04, 1.59) 58% 1.76 (1.59, 2.24) 2.47 (2.25, 2.68) 1.31 (0.99, 1.58) logistic 1.19 (1.14, 1.23) 2.09 (1. logistic 1.14 (1.12, 1.16) 1.84 (1.73, 1.95) 1.34 (1.07, 1.56) 68% 1.59 (1.48, 2.04) 2.29 (2.12, 2.50) 1.41 (1.18, 1.63) logistic 1.08 (1.07, 1.10) 1.69 (1.60, 1.80) 1.16 (0.92, 1.42) Key: the scenarios are as described in the main text of the manuscript. 68, 1.40) 68% 1.45 (1.39, 1.52) 2.23 (2.02, 2.42) 1.08 (0.74, 1.51) logistic 1.07 (1.05, 1.08) 1.57 (1.42, 1.73) 0.85 (0.57, 1.19) 75% H1N1 39% 1.43 (1.38, 1.49) 2.16 (1.97, 2.37) 1.10 (0.75, 1.48) logistic 1.30 (1.26, 1.34) 2.07 (1.87, 2.2 if reporting were in fact increasing throughout the epidemic then the original results could be overstating the magnitude of both the reproductive number and the mean of the serial interval. the estimates using the MLE estimator of the serial interval are comparable to those obtained with the MLE method and are 1.48 for the WT method. 1.11) 1.08 (1.06, 1.08) 0.04 (0.03, 0.05) 68% 1.59 (1.51, 1.70) 1.68 (1.59, 1.80) 1.38 (1.36, 1.41) 1.35 (1.33, 1.35) 0.18 (0.17, 0.19) logistic 1.20 (1.16, 1.22) 1.24 (1.19, 1.29) 1.08 (1.06, 1.11) 1.08 (1.05, 1.10) 0.04 (0.03, 0.05) Discussion We this assumption may lead to overestimating the mean of the serial interval. if the reporting fraction does not change dramatically throughout the course of an epidemic, then estimates may not be impacted substantially. a similar approach could be used to improve estimates to account for suspected levels of misreporting. proof of proposition 1 It is straightforward to observe from the definition of R 0 that when qt = q, the correct estimator simplifies to R 0 = R 0, indicating that estimation of R0 is not impacted by the missingness in the data. 1 t c M t + t = t c + 1 T M t r t = 1 t c + 1 M t 1 + t = t c + 2 T M t 1 t = 1 T M t 1 t = 1 T M t 1 t = 1 T M t 1 t = 1 t c + 1 M t 1 + t = 1 T M t 1 t = 1 T M t 1 qt = q 1 for all values of t, then SE( R 0 ) SE( R 0 ) SE( R 0 ), i.e. we tend to overestimate the standard error. results for overreporting in La Gloria Following are the results when we consider that only a fraction of the total cases in La Gloria were actually of the pH1N1 strain. qt = q, the correct estimator simplifies to R 0 = t = 1 T M t t t = 1 T j = 1 k p j M t j. in this case R 0 = R 0, indicating that estimation of R0 is not impacted by the missingness in the data. 1. = ( 1 t = 1 T M t 1 ( r t = 1 t c + 1 M t 1 + t = t c + 2 T 1 M t 1 ) qt = q 1 for all values of t, then SE( R 0. results for overreporting in La Gloria Following are the results when we consider that only a fraction of the total cases in La Gloria were actually of the pH1N1 strain. cases are randomly selected as pH1N1 cases and included in the analysis. authors declare that they have no competing interests. national institute of general medical sciences or the national institutes of health."}
