NA=not applicable. all detected products from the Flexal virus reaction contained an extra adenosine as a result of nontemplate adenylation as determined by the ESI-MS. however, the products from the B. melitensis reaction contained both nontemplated strands and nonadenylated strands. 10,000 copies of Rickettsia rickettsii isolate and 100 copies of its specific CST were combined in 6 replicates prior to thermocycling. combined Ct average was 33.450.10, representing both products as they are indistinguishable by this assay alone. qPCR methods are useful for microbial forensics due to the ability of these techniques to detect low levels of specific nucleic acid sequences from bacterial, viral, and eukaryotic agents. positive controls are essential to demonstrate full functionality each time the assay is performed. ESI-MS provides a rapid alternative means of confirmation with a time frame of less than an hour following the identification of a potential positive with no additional manipulation. the primary limitations of using ESI-MS to determine amplicon base composition are its inability to elucidate base linking order and its practical size maximum of approximately 160 nucleotides. the ESI-MS successfully detected multiple base differentials between isolates and positive controls as well as a single base SNP in one of the isolates. the technique has broad applicability for quality control of qPCR and qRT-PCR reactions. the ESI-MS method provides vital confidence to scientists, policymakers, and law enforcement officials that the detected signal originates from the presence of a biological agent rather than the positive control. the authors thank Jennifer Goodrich for useful discussions throughout the work described here. contract no.
