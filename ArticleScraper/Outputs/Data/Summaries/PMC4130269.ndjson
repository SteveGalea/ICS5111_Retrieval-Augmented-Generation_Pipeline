{"summary": "researchers identified the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) as the etiologic agent of SARS in 20032 and subsequently the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) of the US. a stable and effective SARS-CoV vaccine could be stockpiled as part of national or global public health emergency preparedness efforts. equine encephalitis vector containing S-protein plasmid was shown to elicit protection in mice challenged with live SARS-CoV. but some S-protein constructs expressed in mammalian cells were found to cause antibody-mediated enhancement. expression of recombinant RBDs in P. pastoris Different constructs were transformed into P. pastoris X-33. 20 clones from each transformation were induced for recombinant protein expression in 10 ml tubes with 0.5% methanol. the extent of glycosylation and apparent M.W. of recombinant RBDs were reduced. successively decreased expression yield of recombinant RBDs was also observed as N-linked glycosylation sites were deleted/mutated. RBD193-WT was induced in culture with different pH (Lane 1: markers; Lane 2: pH 5.2; Lane 3: pH 6.0; Lane 4: pH 7.5; and Lane 5: pH 8.0) the expressed proteins in the medium were transferred on PVDF and probed with 0.2 g/ml of anti-RBD mAb 33G4. recombinant RBD193-N1, RBD219-WT, and RBD219-N1 were purified from the fermented culture by butyl HP and size exclusion chromatography. recombinant RBD193-N3 was purified by negative capture on Q Sepharose XL followed by SEC. blot analysis of 2 g purified RBD 193-N1 (A), RBD193-N3 (B), RBD219-WT (C) and RBD219-N1 (D) was performed. western blot was probed with 0.2 g/ml of anti-RBD mAb 33G4. mAbs 35B5 (Conf IV), 33G4 (Conf V), 24H8 (Conf I) and 31H12 (Conf II) at 0.2 g/ml were used for the test. wild-type SARS-CoV RBD protein expressed in 293T cells was included as the positive control. the mAbs specific for the conformational epitopes (24H8 (Conf I), 19B2 (VI), 35B5 (Conf IV), 33G4 (Conf V), 31H12 (Conf II) were tested at 2.2 g/ml (A) or 0.25 g/ml (B) respectively. functionality of yeast-expressed RBD proteins was further confirmed. no band (binding) was shown in the line of control protein (MERS-CoV RBD) as expected, no band (binding) was shown in the line of control protein (MERS-CoV RBD). a recombinant protein containing sACE2 was included as the negative control (control) Yeast-expressed RBD proteins of SARS-CoV elicited a robust systemic humoral immune response. all yeast-expressed RBD proteins were able to induce sufficient IgG antibody responses against RBD219-WT. the control mice were immunized with alum plus PBS. sera collected at 10 d post-last vaccination were used for the test. alum adjuvant plus PBS was used as the control. data are presented as mean SD of five mice per group. NT50 was presented as mean SD of five mice per group. titers of neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV infection were significantly lower than those induced by RBD193-N1 and RBD193-N3. alum control group did not induce neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV. nes from each transformation were induced for recombinant protein expression in 10 ml tubes with 0.5% methanol. nes from each transformation were induced for recombinant protein expression in 10 ml tubes with 0.5% methanol. a high M.W. smear was observed, especially in wild-type (WT) constructs. both RBD193-WT and RBD219-WT contain 3 N-glycosylation sites. the deleted or mutated sites are highlighted with a line crossing the amino acid (e.g., N-1) or italics (e.g., S-13, and A-40), respectively. the optimal pH for RBD193 expression was pH 6.0. no target protein was expressed in culture with pH over 6.0. the addition of (0.01% or 0.05%) Empigen detergent did not improve expression yield or change pattern of expressed RBD. recombinant RBD193-N1, RBD219-WT, and RBD219-N1 were purified from the fermented culture. recombinant RBD193-N3 was purified by negative capture on Q Sepharose XL followed by SEC. initial attempts to purify RBD193-N1, RBD219-WT, and RBD219-N1 from the fermented culture. wild-type SARS-CoV RBD protein expressed in 293T cells (RBD193-WT) was included as the positive control (E) antigenicity analysis of yeast-expressed RBDs of SARS-CoV. mAb 33G4 strongly recognized all the RBD constructs. wild-type SARS-CoV RBD protein expressed in 293T cells (RBD193-WT) was included as the positive control. we performed ELISA with five conformational anti-RBD mAbs (24H8, 31H12, 35B5, 33G4, and 19B2) and one linear anti-RBD mAb (17H9). 24H8 (Conf I), 19B2 (VI), 35B5 (Conf IV), 33G4 (Conf V), 31H12 (Conf II) and linear epitopes (17H9) of SARS-CoV RBD were tested at 2.2 g/ml (A) or 0.25 g/ml (B) respectively. a recombinant protein containing RBD of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV)28 was included as the negative control. two clear bands corresponding to the size of sACE2 and respective RBD proteins were revealed in the pulled-down samples. only one band corresponding to the size of sACE2 or respective RBD proteins was shown in the control containing either sACE2 or sACE2 only. all yeast-expressed RBD proteins were able to induce sufficient IgG antibody responses against RBD219-WT. the results suggest that RBD219-N1 exhibited the highest immunogenicity. yeast-expressed SARS-CoV RBD proteins induced in vaccinated mice comparable titers of neutralizing antibody against the SARS-CoV. immunization with alum adjuvant plus PBS control induced no neutralizing antibody response against the SARS pseudovirus. titers of neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV infection induced by RBD193-N1 and RBD193-N3 were significantly lower than those induced by RBD193-N1 and RBD193-N3. alum control group did not induce neutralizing antibodies against live SARS-CoV. the expressions of recombinant RBD193 and RBD219 were induced with 0.5% methanol at 30 \u00b0C for 72 h. the highest expression clone was chosen to make seed stock in 20% glycerol as described previously. 10 l of the RBD193-WT/pPICZA/P. pastoris culture induced with 0.5% methanol for 72 h were mixed with 1 l of denaturing buffer (NEB) in a 1.5 ml tube. 2 l of G7 buffer, 2 l of 10% NP40 (all came with PNGase F), 1 l of N-PNGase F, and 5 l of deionized water were added in the constructs of RBD193-N1, RBD193-N3, RBD219-WT, and RBD219-N1 were fermented in 5 L fermentation as described previously. the seed stocks of each construct were used to inoculate 1 L of Buffered Minimal Glycerol (BMG) medium and cultured overnight at 30 \u00b0C with shaking at 225 rpm. atant was diluted with 2 parts of 30 mM Tris and 3 M ammonium sulfate. the bound protein was eluted with gradient ammonium sulfate starting from 2 M. the fractions containing target protein were pooled together, concentrated, and further purified with toyopearl HW55S size exclusion column. ELISA ELISA was used to verify the conformation of the yeast-expressed SARS-CoV RBD proteins to RBD-specific mAbs. 96-well ELISA plates were pre-coated with each yeast-expressed RBD protein (1 g/ml) overnight at 4 \u00b0C and blocked with non-fat milk for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C. 96-well ELISA plates were pre-coated with yeast-expressed RBD219-WT protein (1 g/ml) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. binding of recombinant SARS-CoV RBD proteins to cell-associated receptor ACE2 or soluble ACE2 (sACE2) was performed by pull-down binding assay using previously described protocols with some modifications. 293T cells were co-transfected with a plasmid encoding SARS-CoV S protein and a plasmid encoding Env-defective, luciferase-expressing HIV-1 genome. the cells were seeded in 96-well culture plates at 104/well and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 4\u20136 h to form a monolayer. recombinant plasmids were induced with 0.5% methanol at 30 \u00b0C for 72 h. recombinant plasmids were then transformed into Pichia pastoris X-33. the three asparagines in the RBD sequence responsible for N-glycosylation were removed or mutated to make deglycosylated forms. the expression and glycosylation level of the recombinant RBD193-WT and their deglycosylated forms was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western blot. pastoris X-33 was grown in 5 ml of Buffered Glycerol-complex Medium at 225 rpm at 30 \u00b0C overnight until the OD600 reached 2\u20136. 110 ml of this culture were used to inoculate 2.5 L of sterile BSM in the fermenter containing 3.5 ml/L of PTM1 trace elements and 3.5 ml/L of 0.02% d-Biotin. methanol was pumped in from 0.8 ml/L/h to 10 ml/L/h over a 6\u20138 h period, the pH was adjusted to 6.0 using 14% ammonium hydroxide to purify RBD193-N3, the fermented culture supernatant was chromatographed using an anion exchange Q Sepharose XL column. the flow-through was collected, concentrated and further purified with toyopearl HW55S size exclusion column. the purity of the yeast-expressed recombinant RBDs and the positive control was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. ELISA ELISA was used to verify the conformation of the yeast-expressed SARS-CoV RBD proteins to RBD-specific mAbs. 96-well ELISA plates were respectively pre-coated with each yeast-expressed RBD protein (1 g/ml) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. BD219-WT protein (1 g/ml) overnight at 4 \u00b0C. binding of recombinant SARS-CoV RBD proteins to soluble ACE2 or soluble ACE2 (sACE2) was performed by pull-down assay using previously described protocols. anti-goat IgG (1:1,000, R&D Systems) for 1 h at room temperature. signals were visualized with ECL western blot substrate reagents. the neutralizing titers were reported as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that completely prevented CPE in at least 50% of the wells. the recombinant protein containing 193 amino acids fused with an Fc tag (RBD193-Fc) induced highly potent neutralizing antibody responses and protective immunity in vaccinated animals. methylotrophic yeast Pichia pastoris has been widely used for heterogeneous protein expression for pharmaceutical and vaccine applications. it is capable of many post-translational modifications, such as proteolytic processing, folding, disulfide bond formation and glycosylation. AGE analysis revealed that both yeast-expressed RBD193-WT and RBD219-WT migrated as a smear with apparent molecular weights higher than their calculated M.W. after digestion of RBD193-WT with N-glycosidase PNGase F, the high M.W. smear disappeared and the size of RBD193-WT returned to the expected M.W. recombinant RBD219-N1 was highly recognized by the conformational anti-RBD mAbs14,24. we compared the immunogenicity of RBD219-N1 with wild-type RBDs and some of the other deglycosylated proteins. however, RBD193-N1 and RBD193-N3 exhibited relatively lower antigenicity and immunogenicity than RBD193-WT. deglycosylation of the RBD should not interfere with ACE2 binding. based on the most complete structural model of the SARS-CoV RBD, the C-terminal region of the RBD after residue 512 is disordered but close to the N-terminus of the RBD. therefore, removing the glycosylation site at the N-terminus may help stabilize the overall structure of RBD219. both pseudotyped and live SARS-CoV pointing to its potential use for further development as an effective and safe subunit vaccine against SARS-CoV."}
