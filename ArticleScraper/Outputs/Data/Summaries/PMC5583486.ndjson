{"summary": "large colony sizes, close social interactions, and coroosting of different bat species favor intraspecies and interspecies transmission of viruses. it has been suggested most human coronaviruses (CoV) evolved from bat counterparts (5\u20137). in western and central Europe, M. emarginatus and R. ferrumequinum are endangered (24, 25) due to ongoing habitat fragmentation. after hibernating in underground sites, R. ferrumequinum females return to their natal colonies in March, while M. emarginatus females follow only in May (27\u201329). around mid-June, each female gives birth to a single pup. the overall prevalence of PV was 1.1% (10/878), and that of CoV was 4.9% (43/878); viruses were found in every colony except for those at Colpach and Marienthal. the blue quadrant with the mixed colony of Bech-Kleinmacher as the center has a radius of 45 km.

BLAST and phylogenetic analyses revealed that our PV strains were closely related to those of insectivorous bats from China and South Africa. the pp values of well-supported nodes are shown. the bootstrap support is shown in parentheses. for each cluster, the PV species, as well as the virus family assignment are shown. strains of 2 of the 4 currently recognized CoV genera (i.e., Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus) circulate in Luxembourg, and 36 Alphacoronavirus and 7 Betacoronavirus were detected. three of the 43 coV from this study were added to the data set to represent the genetic diversity of CoV circulating in myotis emarginatus and Rhinolophus ferrumequinum populations in Luxembourg. the deltaCoV strains served as the outgroup for the phylogenetic analyses. betacoronavirus strains from this study clustered within 2 of the 4 recognized lineages (A to D) of Betacoronavirus. BLAST analyses revealed 94% nucleotide identity between partial RdRp gene sequences from this study. all strains from Luxembourg were highly similar to each other and to Betacoronavirus 1 strains identified in various mammalian species. only the pp values of well-supported nodes (pp > 0.7) are shown. strains that were detected in bats are displayed in boldface to stress that most Betacoronavirus 1 species comprise CoV strains that were initially detected in bats. all spike gene sequences were highly similar to each other and shared >98% nucleotide identity with the Betacoronavirus 1 strains from other mammalian species. DISCUSSION Bats are natural reservoirs of numerous viruses with zoonotic potential. diverse CoV and PV strains in bats are known to forage in and around human settlements in Luxembourg. shedding rates may have been underestimated due to RNA degradation, low viral loads in feces (39) and reduced sensitivity of degenerate primers. fecal samples have been used to investigate virus epidemiology and evolution previously (40\u201343) the new CoV obtained in this study was found to be sufficiently divergent to represent a novel RdRp-based grouping unit (RGU) we found no evidence of interspecies transmission, although a mixed-species colony was monitored for 2 years. findings confirm previous studies suggesting an association between Alphacoronavirus and host taxa rather than between geography and viral evolution. the betacoronavirus 1 species is another exception to the typical host specificity of CoV. this species comprises highly similar viruses of distantly related mammals (6, 63\u201366), and so far only a single, short Betacoronavirus 1 sequence has been obtained from a bat (10. spike gene sequences were highly similar to betacoronavirus 1 sequences from other mammalian species, reflecting the genetic stability typical of the lineage. study highlights a certain risk for zoonotic transmission of bat viruses. fecal samples (n = 254) were collected from 6 of the 14 synanthropic M. emarginatus colonies known in Luxembourg. the population size of every known maternity colony was assessed by counting the bats emerging from the roost and/or the bats from a photograph taken in the roost. the monitoring and sample collection were approved by the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Infrastructure Luxembourg.
