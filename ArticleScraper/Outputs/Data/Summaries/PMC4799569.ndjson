{"summary": "from 2006 to 2011, 739 newly diagnosed MM patients were screened for serum hepatitis B virus biomarkers. the prevalence of MM patients infected with bortezomib was 3.4% (n = 25), of which 17 cases were treated with bortezomib. bortezomib has significant anti-myeloma activity and manageable toxicity. the most common adverse effects include gastrointestinal symptoms, peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain, and thrombocytopenia. the effect of bortezomib on the hepatitis B virus (HBV) remains unclear. the fluorescence was FITC/PE/PerCP-Cy5.5/APC. the panel was CD38/CD56/CD9/CD45, CD45/CXCR4/CD117/CD38, CD38/CD138/CD45/CD19, and CD38/CD45/cKappa/cLamda. a minimum of 200 interphase cells were analyzed for each probe. Blood and Marrow Transplantation criteria was used to define complete response (CR), partial response (PR), minimal response, relapse, and progression in MM patients. alanine transaminase (ALT) difference of MM patients with HBV before and after bortezomib treatment was analyzed by paired t-test. a minimum of 200 interphase cells were analyzed for each probe. all patients were screened for presence of HBV surface antigen (HBsAg), surface antibody, e antigen (HBeAg), e antibody (HBeAb), core antibody (HBcAb), and HBV DNA load. 739 MM patients received bortezomib and other agents as therapy. prevalence of HBV infection in MM patients was 3.4%. 16 patients were inactive HBsAg carrier with HBsAg+, HBeAb+, HBcAb+, and normal ALT. 1 patient was chronic HBV carrier with HBsAg+, HBeAg+, HBcAb+, and an HBV DNA load of 1.98 105 copies/ml. the characteristics of 17 multiple myeloma patients with hepatitis B are shown in Table 1. there is no significant difference for the percentages of patients with detectable HBV DNA before and after bortezomib treatment in the 1st cycle. there is no significant difference for the percentages of patients with detectable HBV DNA before and after bortezomib treatment in the 1st cycle. survival Three patients died of disease progression whereas 5 died of lung infection. median overall survival (OS) was 17 months (4\u201362 months) 16 patients were inactive HBsAg carrier with HBsAg+, HBeAb+, HBcAb+, and normal ALT. 1 was chronic HBV carrier with HBsAg+, HBeAg+, HBcAb+, and an HBV DNA load of 1.98 105 copies/ml. this chronic HBV carrier was also infected with hepatitis C identified by abnormal hepatitis C messenger RNA. ALT levels were identified after the treatment of bortezomib. there is no significant difference for the percentages of patients with detectable HBV DNA before and after bortezomib. 117 in patients with or without HBV were 28.6% (2/7) versus 17.4% (37/212) and 50.0% (3/6) versus 42.0% (94/224), respectively. median overall survival (OS) was 17 months (4\u201362 months) only 6 HBsAg+ MM patients in the treatment group and 3 in the control group in this study. 80% of patients were from other parts of the country, representing the actual status and epidemic characteristics of MM patients in china. we excluded such kind of patients due to potential abortive infection or postinfection. bortezomib was shown with a HBV DNA level of 20,000 copies/ml. it was unable to judge the causality relationship between the reactivation and bortezomib. the patient died from fulminant hepatitis. bortezomib therapy in multiple myeloma patients with hepatitis B virus had no impact on the HBV reactivation and liver function of MM patients. however, it is unclear whether bortezomib therapy increase or decrease virus replications in MM patients with HBV infection. bortezomib could impair several immune properties of human dendritic cells. it suppresses essential immune functions of human CD4+ T-cells activated by allogeneic DCs. it is still unclear if bortezomib could induce hepatic injury. the incidence of MM is 2.04/100,000 per year in HBsAg+ population. the rate was significantly higher in MM patients (19.4%) than acute leukemia patients (12.0%), which were higher than the average incidence of hepatitis B (7.2%) announced by china CDC. a MM patient was considered to be in the replicative phase of chronic hepatitis B with HBsAg+, HBeAg+, a serum HBV DNA level of 350,000 copies/ml and normal transferase levels. it was unable to judge the causality relationship between the reactive and bortezomib, and the patient died from fulminant hepatitis. inhibition activity disappeared when the concentration was below 0.2 mg/kg. but when the concentration increased to 5 mg/kg, it did not further decrease. the opposite results were seen in mouse HBV infection in vivo model. the controversial results might derive from the specific immune status of the transgenic mice. the risk of HBV reactivation in MM patients was highest at 3\u20135 months after ASCT during the immune reconstitution phase. the use of thalidomide is recommended in the maintenance setting after the ASCT. despite its potential immune-modulatory effects, it is still unclear if bortezomib could induce HBV reactivation. the efficacy of bortezomib among the MM patients with HBV infection was comparable with other studies. no reactivation was observed in patients in the treatment of lamivudine or entecavir prophylaxis."}
