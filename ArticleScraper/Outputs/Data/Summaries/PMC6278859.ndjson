{"summary": "the canarian archipelago consists of seven main islands located in the Atlantic Ocean 100 km from the northwest africa coast. many anthropological, archaeological, and cultural traits indicate that the most likely origin of Guanche aborigines was the Berber population from North Africa (Hooton 1970), and supporting evidence indicates more than one aboriginal settlement from the Maghreb and the Sahara likely occurred. autosomal markers offer more unbiased estimates than uniparental markers of recent admixture of European (EUR), North African (NAF) and sub-Saharan African (SSA) ancestry among present-day Canary Islanders. studies using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), although limited by number of genetic markers (Pino-Yanes et al. 2011) have shown agreement in placing the population ancestries at 75\u201383% we recently showed that the genetic diversity related to NAF ancestry has important biomedical implications for EUR populations. the population inhabiting the Canarian Archipelago suffers from disproportionate burden of prevalent chronic conditions and associated complications. diabetes, obesity, and hypertension are also more prevalent among Canary Islanders than in other Spanish populations in all age groups. results are based on a subsample of 100,175 SNPs excluding those in high-linkage disequilibrium (LD) from 416 individuals. a total of 100,175 SNPs (r2 threshold of 0.5) from 416 individuals were used. the admixture event took place 13.6 0.7 generations ago (429\u2013495 years BP), which is within the timescale of the historical conquest of the archipelago in the XVth century. the results were consistent across comparisons. unresolved clustering in NAF and Canary Islanders and additional ancestry subdivisions among NAF populations. cross-validation error was lowest for K = 4. results for EUR are largely compatible with previous observations. a larger and more diverse sample of Canary Islanders found a wider NAF-related ancestry interval of 14.9\u201329.9%, and a slightly higher SSA-related ancestry of as much as 9.2%. balancing the number of individuals from the reference populations (n = 75 for each) resulted in similar ancestry estimates. there was no difference in the NAF-related ancestry between the eastern (Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, and Gran Canaria) and western islands. the largest differences were observed between the islands that were conquered first and more peacefully by the Spanish (Fuerteventura, Lanzarote, La Gomera, and El Hierro) genome-wide ROH patterns in canary Islanders reveal level of population isolation. 10 Mb of the genome on an average was in ROHs of >2 Mb in length. samples from la Gomera and El Hierro showed consistently higher average total ROHs than the samples from the remaining islands. the differences disappeared when using the average total of ROHs 1.6 Mb (lowest P = 4.5103) we interpret the ROH patterns observed for La Gomera and El Hierro as signatures of genetic isolation, reduced population size and consequently, endogamy within the archipelago. er genomes have been assessed, we first evaluated two of the fastest and most accurate methods of local ancestry estimation for multiway admixtures. we compared their results with those obtained previously by ADMIXTURE. ELAI offered better fitting estimates than LAMP-LD based on the overall estimates of NAF- and SSA-related ancestries obtained. f. 95% CI European 0.95 0.94\u20130.96 0.83 0.80\u20130.86 North African 0.88 0.85\u20130.90 0.74 0.68\u20130.78 Sub-Saharan African 0.93 0.92\u20130.94 0.89 0.87\u20130.91. the plot shows an example of inference in a chromosome region comparing ELAI (blue) with LAMP-LD (orange) the EUR- and NAF-related peak positions largely overlapped. the EUR-related peaks were located on chr2 (with the lead SNP showing an average local ancestry of 55%) and chr6 (with all lead SNPs located within HLA-B, with an average local ancestry of 49%) one regulatory variant of LCT is the major determinant for lactase persistence in EUR populations. this region underlies the strongest signal of selection in the human genome identified to date. the gene-rich human leukocyte antigen region is also a well-known target of selection in EUR and African populations, likely involving balancing selection. at least one test for the three loci revealed differences from neutrality. frequent support for more than one hit obtained for some regions. common genetic variants previously found to be associated with height.

ADMIXTURE estimates for K = 4 for Canary Islanders and samples from reference populations from Europe, North Africa, and sub-Saharan Africa. for K = 4, the overall ancestry proportions among Canary Islanders were, on an average, 22% NAF and 3% SSA (table 1). balancing the number of individuals from reference populations (n = 75 for each) resulted in similar ancestry estimates (averages of 26% NAF and 1% SSA) the canary Islanders are closely related to EUR. this observation agrees with findings based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) lineages that suggest increased African affinities on the former islands. however, they differ from those based on the nonrecombining portion of the Y chromosome (NRY) that indicate limited NAF affinities of paternal genetic markers on all of the Canary Islands but particularly the populations from the westernmost islands. samples from la Gomera and El Hierro showed consistently higher average total ROHs than did the samples from the remaining islands. genomes from these two islands showed the largest number of fragments in ROHs and the longest average total ROH length. genomes of admixed individuals become a mosaic of chromosomal stretches originating from the ancestral populations. many local ancestry methods perform well in two-way admixture scenarios with large genetic differences between the ancestral populations. difficulty increases with the number of ancestral populations (e.g., three-way admixtures) a least squares estimator indicated that individual fractions were between 2 (SSA) and 4 times (EUR and NAF) as different between ADMIXTURE and LAMP-LD than between ADMIXTURE and ELAI. whereas the lengths of the ancestry blocks provided by ELAI and LAMP-LD were correlated for the three ancestries. block sizes followed lognormal distributions (supplementary fig. 4, Supplementary Material online), with the largest blocks on an average corresponding to the EUR-related component (13.05 Mb) followed by the NAF (8.46 Mb) and SSA (7.48 Mb) components. we would expect averages of 181 EUR-, 82 NAF- and 13 SSA-related blocks per haploid genome. peaks associated with SSA-related ancestry were situated on chr3 (two hits: one with the lead SNP located within SLC6A11, the other with the lead SNP located within KCNMB2, both presenting an average local ancestry of 4.0%), chr6 (with the lead SNP within ZNRD1, showing an average local ancestry of 5.9%), and chr13 (with the lead SNP near PCDH9 and flanked by two one of the regions on chr3 and the region on chr13 showed signals of reduced diversity among Canary Islanders. we then assessed the mean heterozygosity and the number of samples with ROHs containing SNPs from the ancestry-enriched regions. common genetic variants previously found to be associated with height (He et al. 2015), bone traits (Kiel et al. 2007), and asthma (Ferreira et al. 2011) reside in two of these regions (table 5). variants for inflammatory diseases located via genome-wide association studies are significantly enriched in signatures of positive selection in European populations. 679,751 rs13061192 3.02 3.9 chr6: 24,790,462-32,192,083 rs16896944 6.10 5.9 chr13: 57,962,413-70,091,195 rs9540226 3.77 4.4 (*) diversity estimates in regions with large Deviations in African Ancestry in Canary Islanders. Tajima\u2019s D and PBS Test Results Calculated for chr3 and chr13 Regions with a Z score>|3|. chr2 peak indicates a higher proportion of NAF-related alleles in Canary Islanders in this region. the prevalence of lactase nonpersistence alleles in canary Islanders and NAF populations likely explains the chr2 peak in Canary Islanders. a recent ancient DNA study of pre-Hispanic teeth from a small sample of five Guanche people from Tenerife and Gran Canaria also suggested that the dominant phenotype was lactose intolerance. many diseases, such as diabetes, asthma, and allergy, were significantly enriched. regulation of inflammatory response, the complement pathway, telomere maintenance, and antigen processing and presentation were among the pathways significantly enriched (q value 0.05) but ranked lower in the results. a typical haploid genome would consist of fewer than 300 ancestry blocks. the number of EUR-related blocks would be approximately twice and 10 times that of the NAF- and SSA-related blocks. chromosome regions with large deviations in the ancestries were enriched in genes underlying important diseases that disproportionately affect the archipelago. independent analyses should aim to establish time periods of such events. a very low proportion of SSA ancestry was observed in pre-Hispanic human remains. previous genetic studies of pre-Hispanic remains, burial remains from the XVIIth century, and samples from current inhabitants indicate declining frequencies of the NRY lineages. extensive evidence indicates pervasive selection processes in the HLA and LCT regions in different populations. these processes have been explained by dietary and cultural changes occurring with the Neolithic dispersion. DIAPH3, not PCDH9, is the closest candidate target for selection in the chr13 region. the prevalence of some of these diseases in the canary Islands population might be influenced by the distinctive genetic makeup of this population. this is the first study to evaluate the proportion of the genome in the genome in this population. scarce genomic data are available for NAF populations in public databases. as a result, there was limited overlap in SNP contents with the SNP array used. a ubiquitous Berber substrate was recently found in both pre-Hispanic remains from the aboriginal Guanche people and samples from modern NAF populations. this heterogeneity was the justification for considering all available NAF data sets as a single population source in the model. however, we admit that the reference population sources utilized in the study constitute model simplifications. genetyping of 587,352 variants was conducted using the Axiom Genome-Wide Human CEU 1 Array. samples with genotype call rates 95%, discordant sex and family relationships (PIHAT > 0.2) were removed. this information motivated the selection of British (GBR) and Finnish (FIN) people and Utah residents with NW EUR ancestry (CEU) as well as Yoruba Nigerian (YRI) people (n = 108) as representatives for EUR and SSA sources. random subsamples of 75 individuals from each set of EUR, NAF, and SSA samples were alternatively used. ALDER was first used to pretest all reference populations to determine the best pair of populations to be considered ancestral for the estimate. the ADMIXTURE calculations assumed 2 to 7 ancestral populations (K) and used a 10-time cross-validation with random seeds to estimate the best predictive K. ADMIXTURE results were also assessed for the effects of downsampling the number of samples from the reference populations and the use of alternative SSA surrogates other than YRI (GWD and MSL). differences in ADMIXTURE ancestry estimates between islands and regions were assessed by Wilcoxon test. LAMP-LD v1.0 (Baran et al. 2012) and ELAI v1.0 (Guan 2014) assuming three admixing populations (EUR, NAF, and SSA) these two methods do not require SNPs to be independent and perform well with recent multiway admixtures. but ELAI requires haplotype data for the parental populations. an excess of locus-specific ancestry in a segment was considered significant if a large deviation was detected (i.e., Z score>|3|, P 2.7103) genetic diversity was evaluated on the basis of the mean SNP heterozygosity estimates and the mean number of subjects with SNPs from those regions that were contained in ROH stretches. the concentration of each library was determined by a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay. a PhiX DNA sample (1%) was also sequenced with the samples. reads were preprocessed with bcl2fastq v2.18 and aligned to hg19 with BWA-MEM 0.7.15-r1140. observed Tajima\u2019s D and PBS statistics were compared against a null distribution generated from 5,000 neutral simulations under a simplified demographic model. the output only included a set of 28 haplotypes representing the Canarian sample, equivalent in number to those assessed by WGS. the initial values of theta were inferred from the comparison of human and chimp orthologous sequences for each 10-kb region using a mutation rate based on the average number of substitutions per site. the rho parameter was estimated from the deCODE genetics sex-averaged recombination-rate track in the UCSC Genome Browser. to estimate the Ne of Canary Island aborigines in pre-European times, we accessed the publicly available Guanche genome (gun011; accession number ENA: PRJEB86458). this data correspond to a male found in Tenerife for which radiocarbon dating supports an age of 1,216 27 years BP. samples were selected from a large cohort study entitled \u201cCDC of the Canary Islands\u201d (Cabrera de Le\u00f3n et al. 2004), which included 7,000 randomly selected representatives of the general Canarian population aged between 18 and 75 years. informed consent and an extensive health survey were obtained from all participants through personal interviews. ancestry in EUR and SSA populations is clearly distinguishable from Near Eastern influences. this information motivated the selection of British (GBR and Finnish) people and Utah residents with NW EUR ancestry (CEU) as well as Yoruba Nigerian (YRI) people (n = 108) as representatives for EUR and SSA sources. ALDER v1.03 (Loh et al. 2013) was used to calculate the two-locus decay of admixture LD to test the existence of admixture and to infer the time of the most recent admixture event in Canary Islanders. a subsample of 100,175 SNPs from EUR, NAF, SSA, and canary Islanders was used for this assessment. the ADMIXTURE results were also assessed for the effects of downsampling the number of samples from the reference populations. the results were also assessed for the effects of downsampling the number of samples from the reference populations and the use of alternative SSA surrogates other than YRI (GWD and MSL) differences in the average total length of ROHs per island were assessed by Wilcoxon test adjusting for the number of comparisons via Bonferroni correction (P 2.4103 considered significant) local Ancestry Assessments and Block Sizes Local ancestry blocks across autosomes were inferred by using LAMP-LD v1.0 and ELAI v1.0 (Guan 2014). an excess of locus-specific ancestry in a segment was considered significant if a large deviation was detected. genetic diversity was evaluated on the basis of the mean SNP heterozygosity estimates and the mean number of subjects with SNPs from those regions contained in ROH stretches. library sizes were checked on a TapeStation 4200 (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) the concentration of each library was determined by a Qubit dsDNA HS Assay. as a control, a PhiX DNA sample (1%) was also sequenced with the samples. observed Tajima\u2019s D and PBS statistics were compared against a null distribution generated from 5,000 neutral simulations. we used msHOT software (Hellenthal and Stephens 2007) to model the Canary Islanders\u2019 demography. no attempt was made to infer the most likely parameters for the Canary Islanders. initial values of theta were inferred from the comparison of human and chimp orthologous sequences for each 10-kb region using a mutation rate based on the average number of substitutions per site (with the Jukes and Cantor correction) de Genetics sex-averaged recombination-rate track in the UCSC Genome Browser. theta and rho estimates the Ne of the ancestral aborigines in pre-European times. the data correspond to a male found in Tenerife for which radiocarbon dating supports an age of 1,216 27 years BP. ary Material Supplementary data are available at Molecular Biology and Evolution online."}
