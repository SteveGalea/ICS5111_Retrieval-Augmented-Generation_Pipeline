{"summary": "RNA viruses can use a number of mechanisms to subvert the cell cycle (5, 6) it is well known that influenza viruses, such as the current pandemic swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV), continue to pose a worldwide threat (7). the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus still retains considerable pandemic potential (8, 9) two-cell-cycle kinesis involving CDK4/6-cyclin D and CDK2-cyclin E is pivotal in controlling this checkpoint. the Ras homolog gene family member A (RhoA) is a small GTPase that controls many cellular functions, including gene transcription, actin polymerization, cell cycle progression, and cell transformation. in the cell cycle, RhoA activation can affect G1/S progression by at least three signaling pathways. NS1/RhoA/pRb cascade can induce the G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. cDNA of H1N1 NS1 was subcloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX4T-1. pGEM-T-NS1 plasmid was amplified using PCR. d into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX4T-1, the eukaryotic expression vector pcDNA3.0-Flag, and pEGFP-N1. using published sequences, we obtained full-length human RhoA cDNA by reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) the following constructs were obtained and sequenced. mouse anti-flag (M2; F3165) antibody was purchased from Sigma (St. Louis, MO) mouse anti-rhoA (26C4; sc-418), anti-myc (9E10; sc-40), anti-p21 (187; sc-817), anti-cyclin D1 (A-12; sc-8396), anti-influenza virus A NP (sc-101352), anti-influenza virus A NS influenza virus A/WSN/33 (H1N1) was generated using reverse genetics. titers for infection were calculated by plaque assay titration on MDCK cells. cells were mock infected or infected with virus at different multiplicities of infection (MOIs) after 1 h of virus adsorption, the cells were treated with medium containing 10% FBS and harvested at various times postinfection for cell cycle analysis. real-time PCR was detected using SYBR Premix Ex Taq II (TaKaRa) the cycling conditions for real-time PCR were as follows: 95\u00b0C for 1 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. the luciferase expression vector pRL-TK (Promega) was used as a parent vector for RhoA promoter reporter analysis experiments. the bp 2000 and bp 1900 promoters were amplified by PCR using four pairs of primers. each set of assays was performed in triplicate.
