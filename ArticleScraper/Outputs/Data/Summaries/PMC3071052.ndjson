{"summary": "rhMBL concentrations and complement cleavage activity were measured as described elsewhere. pharmacokinetics of rhMBL concentration\u2013time data were evaluated using noncompartmental modeling with WinNonlin Professional Edition (version 5.2; Pharsight) Sham-treated mice were compared with wild-type mice receiving 350 g of rhMBL (referred to as Rx) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 12 hours starting 1 hour before mouse-adapted Ebola virus challenge (100 pfu) both wild-type (WT) and knockout mice lacking complement component 3 (C3 KO) were compared. rhMBL was administered every 12 hours that was started 1 hour before inoculation with 100 pfu of mouse-adapted Ebola virus. mice were rechallenged with rhMBL on day 28. rhMBL was used to measure multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in serum and tissue supernatants according to manufacturer's instructions. mice that survived the infection were tested for Ebola-specific serological response on day 21 and rechallenged with the same virus dose without further treatment. aire either 12 hours before or 1 hour after first dose of rhMBL. mice treated with recombinant human mannose-binding lectin (rhMBL) were compared with wild-type mice receiving 350 g of rhMBL (referred to as Rx) administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) every 12 hours starting 1 hour before mouse-adapted Ebola virus challenge (100 pfu) sham-treated mice had lower proinflammatory and T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine titers in liver homogenates on day 5 after inoculation. rhMBL-treated mice had lower proinflammatory and T helper cell type 2 (Th2) cytokine titers in liver homogenates on day 5 after inoculation. fifteen wild-type mice received a 10-day course of rhMBL administered every 12 hours that cells were washed with PBS and fixed in BD cytofix. data were immediately acquired with a BD FACSCantoII. the bio-Plex Mouse Cytokine 23-Plex Panel assay was used to measure multiple cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors in serum and tissue supernatants according to manufacturer's instructions. the average maximum serum concentration exceeded the minimum concentration of MBL that inhibited infection in vitro by at least 55-fold. the average ratio of maximum to baseline complement component 4 cleavage activity was 1.7 for the 75-g rhMBL dose and 5.4 for the 350-g dose. hMBL to 350 g administered every 12 hours for 10 days starting either 1 hour before or 12 hours after virus challenge. survival increased from 0% to >40% in wild-type and complement component 3 (C3)-deficient mice. surviving mice had detectable Ebola virus\u2013specific antibodies 28 days after infection. plenic CD3CD19+ cells and CD11b+ granulocytes were higher in rhMBL-treated mice. RNA viral loads as determined by RT-PCR in blood, liver, and spleen 5 days after infection were similar in sham- and rhMBL-treated mice. cytokines and chemokines in blood were generally lower on days 1 and 3 in rhMBL-treated mice. the advent of newly emerging or drug-resistant viruses calls for the development of more broadly active agents targeting viral components shared among viruses. we tested a stringent Ebola virus infection model (3000 LD50) in mice. rhMBL can be used as a therapeutic agent to achieve serum concentrations in mice that correspond to levels in humans 7\u201324-fold higher than average human concentrations. rhMBL treatment bridged surviving mice to development of an effective adaptive immune response. future experiments will be needed to scale high-dose rhMBL therapy for use in larger animal models. 08_RD_B received additional support from NIH grants 1UO1 AI074503 and 1R21 AI077081."}
