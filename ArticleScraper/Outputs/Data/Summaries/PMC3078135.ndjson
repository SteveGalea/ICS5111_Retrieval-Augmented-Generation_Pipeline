{"summary": "members of the Parvoviridae family are small non-lipid enveloped viruses with a diameter of 18\u201326 nm, icosahedral symmetry (T = 1). the subfamily of densovirinae contains four genera: Densovirus, Iteravirus, Brevidensovirus and Pefudensovirus. the bocavirus genus was recently assigned to parvovirus genomes containing a third ORF (labeled HBoV3 was first reported in the stool of australian children with non-polio acute flaccid paralysis [10], then in australian children and Chinese children with diarrhea [9], [25]. HBoV4 was reported in the stool of children with AFP from Nigeria and Tunisia [5], and then in untreated sewage water from throughout the US [26]. a novel bocavirus was identified in the feces of captive gorillas with diarrhea [6] and from wild go porcine bocavirus 1 (PBoV1-H18) and porcine bocavirus 2 (PBoV 2-A6) were also screened for in 340 stool samples of asymptomatic swine from five provinces of china. the nearly complete genomes of both viruses were described here. samples were suspended in PBS (0.01 M phosphate, pH7.2\u20137.4, 0.15NaCl), vortexed, centrifuged at 15000 g, and filtered through a 0.22-m filter to remove eukaryotic- and bacterial-cell-sized particles. the samples were then treated with benzonase, DNase and RNase to digest non-particle-protected nucleic acid. rose gel and were gel purified (Axygen, CA, USA) then subcloned into pMD-18T plasmid vector (TaKaRa, Japan) for sequencing. sequences were then screened for sequence similarities using tBLASTx and BLASTn against the nr database in GenBank. primers PBoV1-L1 (5\u2032-CTGTGGCACTTCAGATTTAC-3\u2032) and PBoV1-R sequence and phylogenetic analysis Sequences of each PCR product were assembled using seqMan II program (DNASTAR, Inc) the identification of open reading frames (ORFs) was performed by a translated BLAST search (BLASTx at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) 340 porcine stool samples from different aged swine were collected from 17 middle or large-scale porcine farms in five provinces of china from April 2008 to October 2009. 80 were collected from four farms located in Shanghai, 60 from three farms located in Jiangsu province, 120 from six farms located in Anhui province, 20 from a farm located in Shandong province and 60 from three farms located in Guizhou province. anhui 6 45 41/60 42/60 45\u201390 36/60 39/60 77/120 (64.2%) 46/120 (38.3%) Shandong 1 45 5/10 5/10 4/10 6/10 9/20 (45%) 11/20 (55%) 6/20 (30%) Guizhou 3 45 26/30 21/30 45\u201390 19/30 18/30 45/60 (75%) 39/60 (65%) 28/60 (46.7%) Total 17 215/340 (63.2%) 219/340 (64.4 novel virus identification and complete genome sequencing Random RT-PCR DNA products ran as smears on agarose gel and were gel purified (Axygen, CA, USA) sequences were then screened for sequence similarities using tBLASTx and BLASTn against the nr database in GenBank. primers PBoV1-L1 (5\u2032-CTGTGGCACTTCAGATTTAC-3\u2032) and PBoV1-R2 (5\u2032-TCTGTT PBoV2-R2 (5\u2032- TCTCGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGTGT PBo-likeV (FJ872544), PBoV1 and PBoV2 (HM053693 and HM053694), and 6V and 7V (HM053672 and HM053673). protein amino acid distances were calculated using the neighbor joining (NJ) method with bootstrap of 1,000 replicates with MEGA 4.1. the 24 sequences from porcine sample A6 were assembled to form a continuous sequence of approximately 2700 nucleotides. PCR primers based on the available H18 sequences and regions highly conserved between HBoV2 and canine bocavirus were used to amplify the nearly complete bocavirus genome we provisionally called PBoV1-H18 (5267 nt) the black boxes represent the known spliced exon of NS1 transcripts. prevalence of PBoV1 and PBoV2 Nucleic acids were extracted from 340 porcine stool samples. a group (except for the V6/V7 variants with only NP1 sequences available) were most closely related to the canine bocavirus CnMV. PBoV2-A6 was closely related in NP1 to the first reported partial porcine bocavirus sequence PBo-likeV from Sweden.

HBoV1 has been associated with respiratory symptoms while other HBoV may be associated with diarrhea and acute flaccid paralysis."}
