{"summary": "influenza type A virus genome consists of eight single-stranded negative-sense RNA segments, which encode up to 11 viral proteins. annual epidemics occur frequently due to antigenic shift, the process by which the viral surface glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), acquire point mutations allowing the virus to partially overcome preexisting immunity. NA interacts with human antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 6/cluster of differentiation 66c. overexpression of C6 causes resistance to anoikis (13), a form of cell death. inhibition of C6 expression using siRNA led to a loss of activation of Src, FAK, and Akt, increased cell death and a significant loss of expression of viral proteins.

BLAST analysis identified the insert as the mammalian C6 cDNA (supplemental Fig. S1A) both proteins were expressed using an in vitro coupled transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte system in the presence of [35S]Met. lysates were harvested and NA and C6 proteins were immunoprecipitated using specific antibodies. the NA of PR8 was found to co-precipitate with C6; conversely, C6 was co-precipitated with NA. influenza virus infection increases C6 mRNA and protein expression levels. expression increases with time of PR8 infection (4, 6, and 16 h at m.o.i. of 1. real-time PCR analysis (n = 2) of C6 (a) and NP (c) expression increases with increasing dose of PR8 infection (m.o.i. of 0.1, 0.5, and 5.0); the same samples were checked for protein expression of C6 (b) and NP (d) third lane in second panel shows down-regulation of NS1 after using siRNA against C6. NHBE cells were treated with siRNA against C6 and control siRNA for 24 h and then infected with PR8 virus at m.o.i. of 1. HEK-293 and A549 cells were transfected with the plasmid expressing H5N1 NA or empty plasmid as control and harvested at 48 h after transfection. equal amounts of protein from test and control sets were subject to Western blot analysis. pathway is Akt-dependent but independent of ERK activation. p 0.04, p 0.01, p 0.008, and p 0.02 for P-Akt, P-FAK, and P-GSK3. knock down of C6 shows down-regulation of P-Akt, P-Src, and P-FAK at 24 h. A549 and NHBE cells transfected with scrambled siRNA and C6-specific siRNA were infected with PR8 virus and then subjected to an MTT assay. substantial cell death was observed in C6 siRNA-treated cells compared with the scrambled controls. C, A549 cells were treated either with siRNA against C6 or scrambled siRNA for 48 h. cells were stained with Annexin-V followed by flow cytometry analysis. data indicated NA overexpression and its interaction with C6-increased Akt phosphorylation. Akt expression by immunoblot (Aa, Ab, Ba, Bb), cell viability by MTT assay (Ac, Bc) and viral titers by plaque assay (Ad, Bd) decreased cell viability with ly294002 and wortmannin. PI3K inhibitors act upstream of Akt phosphorylation. a mammalian lung cDNA library was screened using the NA gene from a highly pathogenic avian influenza virus as a bait. BLAST analysis identified the insert as the mammalian C6 cDNA (supplemental Fig. S1A) both proteins were expressed using an in vitro coupled transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte system in presence of [35S]Met. HEK-293 cells do not express endogenous C6 expression plasmids. NA and C6 co-localize on the membrane of mammalian cells. lysates were harvested, and NA and C6 proteins were immunoprecipitated. A549 cells were infected with PR8 at a m.o.i. of 1 and fixed at 16 h after infection. nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) 549 cells were infected with PR8 virus at a m.o.i. of 1 and harvested 24 h after infection. expression increases with time of PR8 infection (4, 6, and 16 h at m.o.i. of 0.1and 1.0) first lane shows control levels of C6, NP, and NS1. second lane shows down-regulation of NP after using siRNA against C6. second lane shows down-regulation of NS1 after using siRNA against C6. expression of NA alone was sufficient to induce phosphorylation of Src, FAK, and Akt compared with the vector-only control. the densitometry graphs compare the relative intensity of the bands (Fig. 5, A and B, respectively) these results suggest that the NA/C6 interaction activates the cell survival signaling pathway through Akt. bottom panel shows -actin control in A549 cells where endogenous levels of C6 were checked by immunofluorescence staining. results were analyzed as in A with values of p 0.04, p 0.01, p 0.008, and p 0.02 for P-Akt, P-FAK, and P-GSK3 respectively. knock down of C6 shows down-regulation of P-Akt, P-Src, and P-FAK at 24 h. infection with PR8 virus resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of Src, FAK, Akt, and Bcl-2 molecules in both A549 and NHBE cells. total levels of each of these proteins were unaffected by virus infection. we then studied the biological effect of the NA-C6 complex on cell survival. samples were examined 24 h after infection by MTT assay. C, A549 cells were treated either with siRNA against C6 or scrambled siRNA for 48 h. cells were stained with Annexin-V followed by flow cytometry analysis. PI3K inhibitors act upstream of Akt phosphorylation. lyastes and supernantants were harvested 24 h after infection. lyastes and supernantants were harvested 24 h after infection. PR8 infection resulted in significant decrease in cell viability and viral titers in both cell lines. however, we did not see significant change in plaque size. these results suggest a role for NA-C6 in augmenting cell survival following influenza virus infection via the Src/Akt axis. both proteins were expressed using an in vitro coupled transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte system in the presence of [35S]Met. immunofluorescence analysis, following co-transfection of HEK-293 cells, revealed a co-localization of both proteins to the plasma membrane. thus, NA co-localizes and interacts with C6. NA and C6 co-localize on the membrane of mammalian cells (A549) infected with PR8 influenza virus at a m.o.i. of 1 and fixed at 16 h after infection. nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue) C6 expression was induced in virus-infected A549 cells in a PR8 dose-dependent manner. expression increases with time of PR8 infection (4, 6, and 16 h at m.o.i. of 0.1and 1.0) expression increases with increasing dose of PR8 infection. NHBE cells were treated with siRNA against C6 and scrambled siRNA for 48 h and then infected with PR8 virus at an m.o.i. of 1. cells were harvested at 24 h after infection. second lane shows minimal effect of scrambled siRNA on the same protein levels. second lane shows down-regulation of NP after using siRNA against C6. phospho-ERK (Tyr-204) and phospho-Akt (Thr-308) were stimulated in NA and C6 co-transfected cells. however, phosphorylation of ERK was unaffected. expression of NA alone was sufficient to induce phosphorylation of Src, FAK, and Akt. results were analyzed as in A with values of p 0.04, p 0.01, p 0.008, and p 0.02 for P-Akt, P-FAK, and P-GSK3, respectively. knock down of C6 shows down-regulation of P-Akt, P-Src, and P-FAK at 24 h. total levels of each of these proteins were unaffected by virus infection. infection of cells after C6-specific siRNA treatment resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of Src, FAK, Akt, and Bcl-2 molecules. the knockdown of C6 levels decreases viability of influenza A virus-infected cells. samples were examined 24 h after infection by MTT assay. NHBE cells were treated either with siRNA against C6 or scrambled siRNA for 48 h. PI3K inhibitors supressed Akt phosphorylation and increased virus-induced cell death in A549 and NHBE cells. Akt inhibitors Triciribine, 124005, and GSK690693 inhibited virus-induced Akt phosphorylation in both A549 and NHBE cells. siRNA pools against Akt1, Akt2 and Akt3 significantly reduced the Akt expression in infected or uninfected NHBE cells. PR8 infection resulted in significant decrease in cell viability (Fig. 8, Ab and Bb) and viral titers in both cell lines (Fig. 8, Ac and Bc) however, despite the change in cell viability and viral titers as result of Akt phosphorylation, we did not see significant change in plaque size. BLAST analysis identified the insert as the mammalian C6 cDNA. both proteins were expressed using an in vitro coupled transcription-translation rabbit reticulocyte system in presence of [35S]Met. immunofluorescence analysis, following co-transfection of HEK-293 cells, revealed a co-localization of both proteins to the plasma membrane. virus subtypes include a reassortant H3N2 (A/X-31), a neurotropic H1N1 (A/WSN/1933), and a recently emerged pandemic H1N1 (A/California/08/2009). co-localization of NA and C6 in A549 cells infected with PR8 by immunofluorescence indicates that this interaction is also likely to occur within infected cells. C6 expression was induced in virus-infected A549 cells in a PR8 dose-dependent manner. expression increases with time of PR8 infection (4, 6, and 16 h at m.o.i. of 0.1and 1.0) expression increases with increasing dose of PR8 infection. C6 siRNA-treated influenza A virus-infected cells down-regulate NP and NS1. first lane shows down-regulation of NP after using siRNA against C6. second lane shows down-regulation of NS1 after using siRNA against C6. NA Activates Akt cell survival pathway through its interaction with C6. HEK-293 and A549 cells were transfected with plasmid expressing H5N1 NA or empty plasmid (pcDNA 3.1 myc/his) as control and harvested at 48 h after transfection. phospho-Src (Tyr-416), phospho-FAK (Tyr-925), phospho-ERK (Tyr-204) and phospho-Akt (Thr-308) were subject to Western blot analyses. results were analyzed using paired t tests. differences were considered significant at p 0.005, p 0.05, and p 0.01 for P-FAK, P-Src, and P-GSK3, respectively. NHBE cells were transfected with control siRNA or C6 siRNA for 24 h. cells were harvested for the expression analysis of C6, P-Akt, P-Src, and P-Bcl-2. infection with PR8 virus resulted in enhanced phosphorylation of Src, FAK, and Akt. Staining for Annexin-V, a marker for the early stages of cell death, also indicated that viability was decreased upon inhibition of C6 in A549 cells. there was a significant decrease in cell viability with the knockdown of C6 and virus-infected samples. phosphorylation levels of Akt were reduced in cells treated with PI3K inhibitors and infected with PR8 virus. PI3K inhibitors supressed Akt phosphorylation and increased virus-induced cell death in A549 and NHBE cells. Akt inhibitors Triciribine, 124005, and GSK690693 inhibited virus-induced Akt phosphorylation in both A549 and NHBE cells. Akt inhibitors decreased cell viability (Fig. 7, Ac and Bc) and virus replication (Fig. 7, Ad and Bd) in PR8-infected NHBE cells. the primary role of influenza NA protein has been believed to be in the release of progeny viruses from infected cells. NA is critical for the initiation of infection and resultant influenza pathogenesis (19, 20) there have been limited studies investigating a role for influenza NA in cell signaling. CEACAM family members have been shown to activate tyrosine kinase activity and play a role in inhibition of apoptosis. ligands that initiate these signaling pathways have not been fully elucidated. the interaction was well conserved across different subtypes of influenza viruses. in the context of viral infection, silencing C6 led to a reduction in expression of NP and NS1 proteins as well as vRNA levels of NP. influenza virus infection has previously been shown to result in the up-regulation of expression of integrins and other neutrophil adhesion molecules."}
