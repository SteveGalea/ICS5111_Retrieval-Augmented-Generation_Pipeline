{"summary": "study identified respiratory pathogens causing acute respiratory tract infections in children below 5 years of age. pathogen patterns shift due to factors such as hygiene, vaccinations, and antibiotic resistance. 102 cases and 96 controls were included. 800 000 of the 5.6 million total deaths in children less than 5 years old were caused by LRTIs in 2016. children with LRTI can present with a highly variable package of symptoms including cough, tachypnoea, dyspnoea, fever, rhinitis, chest pain, abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea and headache. recent developments in Senegal indicated viruses as main pathogens of all acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) the frequency of virus detection was even higher than those found in several other countries. cases-control studies have been conducted in africa, investigating the association between different pathogens and pneumonia. unmatched case-control study was performed at the institute de P\u00e9diatrie Sociale. children with respiratory infections were enrolled using convenience sampling. controls were enrolled during the vaccination programme, which took place once a week. thoracic pain, sore throat, dyspnoea, chest indrawings, tachypnoea, cyanosis, and rhinorrhoea were defined using the WHO definition of a respiratory rate >60 breaths/min in children 2 months of age. thoracic pain, sore throat, dyspnoea, chest indrawings, tachypnoea, cyanosis, and rhinorrhoea C-reactive protein was determined using the CRP Latex Kit 850A (Lorne Laboratories, Berkshire, UK) a sample size of 182 was yielded when using logistic regression, an alpha of.05, and a small-to-medium effect size with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.60.28. every case was called a minimum of 3 times when parents did not respond. every case was called a minimum of 3 times when parents did not respond. leucocytosis was present if leucocytes are increased to more than 11 000/mm3. alarming signs were defined as tachypnoea with cough and/or dyspnoea. oropharyngeal samples were collected. continuous variables were expressed as medians and ranges. they were compared using the Mann-Whitney U test. 102 cases and 96 controls were analysed. 31.7% had a pneumonia based on WHO criteria. the main respiratory symptoms were rhinitis and cough, in 90 (88.2%) and 89 (87.3%) of cases, respectively. malaria rapid diagnostic tests were performed on only 32 cases, but all were negative. data on follow-up were only available in 51 cases. none of the children had to be hospitalized. microbiological analysis For detection of bacteria, only culture was used. at least 1 pathogen was detected in 90.1% of cases and 53.7% of controls. a better differentiation between bacterial colonization and infection can be made using cultures. ophila, B pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Coronavirus 229, Coronavirus OC43, Coronavirus HKUI, PIV (parainfluenza virus) 1, PIV 3, PIV 4, human metapneumovirus, and influenza virus C were investigated. the prevalence of pathogens in cases and controls is illustrated in Figure 2. Table 3. Microbiological findings for respiratory samples of cases and controls. 0.7 (0.2-2.1) RSV 17 (16.8) 7 (7.4) 2.5 (1.0-5.4) 5.2 (1.6-16.5) PIV 2 1 (1.0) 0 (0) \u2014 Influenza A virus 32 (31.7) 7 (7.4) 5.8 (2.4-14.0) 5.8 (1.9-17.5) Influenza A virus (H1N1) 30 (29.7) 8 (8.4) 4.6 (2.0-10.6) 4.6 (1.6-) Influenza B virus 12 (11.9) 2 (2.1) pathogens No. of times involved in co-detections Streptococcus pneumoniae 38 Influenza A 20 RSV 11 Influenza B virus 9 Haemophilus influenzae 8 Enterovirus 6 Adenovirus 6 Mycoplasma pneumoniae 4 Streptococcus beta-hemolytic 3 Acinobacter spp. cases more often lived in other areas in and outside of Dakar. more controls than cases lived in the neighbourhood near the Pikine clinic. 31.7% had pneumonia based on WHO criteria. an elevated CRP was seen in 72.8% of cases with a mean CRP of 47.2 (41) in all, 46.2% had a leucocytosis with a mean number of leucocytes of 11 527.8 (5654.5) microbiological analysis For detection of bacteria, only culture was used. at least 1 pathogen was detected in 90.1% of cases and 53.7% of controls. viruses were detected in 75.3% of cases and 42.1% of controls. 1.9-17.5), RSV (aOR: 5.2, CI: 1.6-16.5) and S pneumoniae (aOR: 3.0, CI: 1.2-7.4) were investigated, but not detected in cases or controls. the prevalence of pathogens in cases and controls is illustrated in Figure 2. Coronavirus NL63 1 (1.0) 3 (3.2) 0.3 (0.0-3.0) Enterovirus 8 (7.9) 5 (5.3) 1.5 (0.5-4.9) Enterovirus 6 (5.9) 8 (8.4) 0.7 (0.2-2.1) RSV 17 (16.8) 7 (7.4) 2.5 (1.0-5.4) 5.2 (1.6-16.5) PIV 2 1 (1.0) 0 (0). it was most frequently found in combination with influenza virus A, in 17 cases. no additional relationship was found, other than a cumulative association of the present pathogens. analysis of cases Treatment with antibiotics was not significantly related to alarm signs: tachypnoea (OR: 3.9, CI: 0.5-33.0), withdrawals (OR: 0.2. CI: 0.0-1.1), and hypoxemia (OR: undefined). dieng et al studied pathogens in children with ARTI in Senegal. they found a total of 78 bacteria in 162 children. they found a lower prevalence of S pneumoniae (18% of cases) in comparison with our study. adenovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus were found in children with an ARTI. the average prevalence of rhinovirus in those studies is approximately 30%. adenovirus, enterovirus, and rhinovirus were found in 7.4% of controls. similar pathogens were found with similar significant associations with illness compared with our study. some pathogens were more prevalent in other settings, such as human metapneumovirus, PIV, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. the average age of controls is lower than the average age of children with a respiratory infection, probably due to the young age of children enrolled in vaccination programmes. however, we did not discern significant heterogeneity regarding pathogens in different age groups (except for the mentioned differences in prevalence of RSV) or living areas."}
