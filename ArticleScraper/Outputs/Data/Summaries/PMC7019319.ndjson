{"summary": "NiV is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA virus that is a member of the genus Henipavirus (family Paramyxoviridae) from 2001 onwards, seasonal outbreaks are observed almost annually in Bangladesh and sporadically in India [2] from 2001 onwards, seasonal outbreaks are observed almost annually in Bangladesh and sporadically in India [2] from 2001 onwards. the glycoproteins of both viruses bind to the host cell receptors ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 [19,20,21,22], which are highly conserved across many species [23]. the most promising therapeutic approach against Henipavirus infection is the one based on the application of the experimental human monoclonal antibody m102.4, which binds the ephrin-B2 and ephrin-B3 the ability of HeVsG to protect against NiV infection in some animal models warrants the evaluation of a vaccine that contains a soluble form of NiV glycoprotein G. the role of antibodies in protective immunization against NiV infection has been widely reported, however there is limited information on NiV-specific T-cell-mediated immunity. this, in turn, will aide in the development of new and improved vaccine candidates. mice backcrossed more than 20-fold on the C57BL/6 background. were bred under specified-pathogen-free (SPF) conditions. all experiments were approved by the government of Upper Bavaria. cDNA encoded for the entire 602 amino acid sequence of the NiV-G protein (Nipah virus isolate UMMC1, GenBank accession number AY029767.1) was modified in silico by introducing silent codon alterations to remove termination signals of TTTTTNT and G/C nucleotide runs. for construction of the soluble form of NiV-G protein (NiVsG), the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains recombinant viruses MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G were clonally isolated by screening for co-expression of the fluorescent protein marker GFP and plaque passaging several times. polymerase chain reaction analysis of genomic viral DNA served to confirm the genetic identity and genomic stability of the MVA vector viruses. Membranes were washed three times with PBS containing 0.1% Tween 20 (PBS/T) and probed with goat anti-mouse IgG conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) cells were blocked in blocking buffer containing 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) cells were stained with polyclonal rabbit anti-NiV-G diluted 1:10,000 in PBS containing 0.5% BSA (PBS/BSA) antigen-specific IgG responses induced by immunization with the vaccine candidates were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) plates were coated with 50 ng/well recombinant protein (100 L volume) and incubated overnight at 4 \u00b0C. plates were washed three times with 200 L/well PBS/T. the absorbance was measured on an ELISA plate reader at 450 nm. total IgG titers were calculated from the inflection point of the titration curve as logarithms of the reciprocal. peptides restricted to mouse MHC class II allele H2-IAb were analyzed. the most promising candidates were then chosen for further experimental epitope prediction studies. spleens were collected from mice 8 days after the final immunization. 2 105 splenocytes were seeded onto 96-well flat bottom plates. 100 L/well peptide pools, subpools, or individual peptides were added. nonstimulated cells were used as a mock control. 10x Brefeldin A was prepared by diluting 1000X Brefeldin A (Biolegend, San Diego, CA, USA) in RMPI-10. cells were then incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. extracellular staining was performed with antibodies diluted in FACS buffer. cells were washed twice with 200 L/well PBS and fixed with 100 L/well of Fixation Buffer (Biolegend) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. cells were stained intracellularly in 100 L/well of anti-mouse IFN- (clone XMG1.2, 1:200, Biolegend) plus TNF- (clone MP6-XT22, 1:200, Biolegend) diluted in 1X Perm Wash buffer for 30 Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) the threshold for statistical significance was p 0.05. mice backcrossed more than 20-fold on the C57BL/6 background. co\u2019s Modified Eagle\u2019s Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% Penicillin\u2013Streptomycin (Sigma-Aldrich), 1% MEM nonessential amino acid solution (Sigma-Aldrich), and 1% HEPES solution (Sigma-Aldrich). cells were maintained at 37 \u00b0C in a humidified 5% CO2 atmosphere. recombinant viruses MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G were clonally isolated by screening for co-expression of the fluorescent protein marker GFP. recombinant viruses were amplified in CEF, purified by ultracentrifugation through 36% sucrose cushions, and reconstituted in 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 9.0. cell lysates were prepared or culture supernatants were collected at various time points after infection. cell-associated and secreted proteins were resolved by sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide (10%) gel electrophoresis. proteins were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes by wet electroblotting. immunofluorescence Confluent monolayers of HeLa cells were infected with recombinant MVA\u2013NiVsG or MVA\u2013NiV-G viruses at MOI 0.05. controls included MVA (MOI 0.05) and inoculation medium alone (mock) cells were incubated for 16 h in a 37 \u00b0C incubator. mice were euthanized 8 days after immunization. blood was centrifuged at 1300 g for 5 min in miniCollect vials. serum was stored at 20 \u00b0C until further use. 100 L/well 3,3\u2032, 5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) Liquid Substrate System for ELISA (Sigma-Aldrich) was added. plates were incubated until a color change was observed. the reaction was stopped by the addition of 100 L/well Stop Reagent. theoretical peptides of each amino acid sequence length were synthesized and tested. peptides of each amino acid sequence length were synthesized and tested. the most promising candidates were then chosen for further experimental epitope prediction studies. splenocytes were incubated with mouse CD4 and CD8 MicroBeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany) and processed by negative selection using the QuadroMACS Separator (Miltenyi Biotec) splenocytes were seeded onto 96-well flat bottom plates. Flow Cytometry Splenocytes were diluted to 1 107 cells/mL in RPMI-10. 100 L/well (1 106 cells) was added onto a 96-well U-bottom plate. the VACV CD8 T cell epitope B8R20\u201327 (final concentration of 8 g/mL) was used as a positive control. cells were stained intracellularly in 50 L/well for 30 min on ice. washed twice with 200 L/well PBS and fixed with 100 L/well. cells were then washed three times with 200 L/well 1X Perm Wash buffer. single-color controls were prepared for each FACS analysis using oneComp eBeadsTM Compensation Beads (eBioscience, Thermo Fisher Scientific) single-color controls were prepared for each FACS analysis using oneComp eBeadsTM Compensation Beads (eBioscience, Thermo Fisher Scientific) data was analyzed using FlowJo (FlowJo LLC, BD Life Sciences, Ashland, OR, USA) 2 105 splenocytes were seeded onto 96-well flat bottom plates. 100 L/well peptide pools, subpools, or individual peptides were added. nonstimulated cells were used as a mock control. 10x Brefeldin A, a golgi inhibitor, was prepared by diluting 1000X Brefeldin A. cells were then incubated for an additional 4 h at 37 \u00b0C. extracellular staining was performed with antibodies diluted in FACS buffer. cells were washed twice with 200 L/well PBS and fixed with 100 L/well of Fixation Buffer (Biolegend) for 20 min at room temperature in the dark. cells were stained intracellularly in 100 L/well of anti-mouse IFN- (clone XMG1.2, 1:200, Biolegend) plus TNF- (clone MP6-XT22, 1:200, Biolegend) diluted in 1X Perm Wash buffer for 30 Statistical analysis Data were analyzed using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and were expressed as mean standard error of the mean (SEM) the threshold for statistical significance was p 0.05.

IFNAR/ mice on a C57BL/6 background were immunized twice with the MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccine via the intraperitoneal (i.p.) route. splenocytes were prepared 8 days after the final inoculation. CD4 and CD8 T cells were purified and restimulated with overlapping 15mer peptides corresponding to the NiV-G protein. CD8 T cells from these mice were restimulated with the above subpools and individual peptides #1 and #2. IFN- production above the background was observed in cultures stimulated with #1 (mean = 349 87 SFC/106 cells), but not #2, in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group. a peptide library was generated comprising 15mer peptides. each cell of the matrix represents an individual 15mer peptide. the sequences were then analyzed for H2-b binding computationally using the SYFPEITHI database. of the sixteen 8\u201311mer overlapping peptides tested, eight resulted in the stimulation of measurable IFN- in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group. the amino acid sequence of the positive 15mer peptide, #1, served to generate peptides with every possible 8\u201311mer sequence. Graphs show IFN- SFC of total splenocytes from i.p. immunized mice restimulated with the six most positive 8\u201311mer peptides. the sequence of peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) was present in all positive 10\u201311mer peptides. the sequence of peptide 8.4 (STDNQAVI) was present in the eight positive peptides. peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) (mean = 906 109 IFN- SFC/106 cells respectively) is a potential H2-b-restricted epitope candidate of NiV-G. the alignment of peptide 9.3 to the full sequence of NiV-G is shown in Figure S3. the mean SFC values were significantly higher for the MVA\u2013NiVsG group relative to the MVA\u2013NiV-G group. the means of the MVA\u2013NiVsG group were 914 221 IFN- SFC/106 cells. the means of the MVA\u2013NiV-G group were 410 68 IFN- SFC/106 cells. IFN- ICS data showed that both the frequency and absolute number of IFN-+ CD8 T cells were significantly higher than the control background levels. the mean frequencies of IFN-+ CD8 T cells were 0.84% 14% for the MVA\u2013NiVsG group. IFNAR/ mice were vaccinated once with MVA\u2013NiVsG, MVA\u2013NiV-G, MVA, or mock via the i.m. route. ELISPOT and IFN- + TNF- ICS tested their immunogenicity after a single vaccination. percentages were lower than what was observed after prime-boost immunization. this indicates that prime immunization with MVA\u2013NiVsG was sufficient to generate a sizeable population of polyfunctional antigen-specific CD8 T cells. total splenocytes from i.m. immunized mice were restimulated and measured by IFN- ELISPOT assay or IFN- intracellular cytokine staining. T cell responses were measured by IFN- ELISPOT assay. we performed a computational analysis of the 15mer peptides in the five most positive peptide pools measured by ELISPOT assay. these peptides were #49 (LFMTNVWTPPNPNTV) and #50 (NVWTPPNPNTVYHCS) for this, splenocytes from mice that had been vaccinated with MVA\u2013NiV-G or MVA\u2013NiVsG were stimulated with peptides #49 and # peptide #49 is a promising H2-IAb-restricted CD4 T cell epitope candidate of NiV-G. the alignment of the peptide to the full amino acid sequence of wild-type NiV-G is shown in Figure S3.

NiV-G is a 602 amino acid long protein consisting of an internal domain, a transmembrane domain, and a C-terminal external domain. for NiVsG protein, an internal leader sequence and three amino acid linkers have replaced the internal and transmembrane domains. recombinant NiV full-length glycoprotein G (NiV-G) and NiV soluble glycoprotein G (NiVsG) colored rectangles represent individual protein domains. bracketed text displays the start and end of amino acid sequences of each domain. cell lysates and culture supernatants were incubated with (+) or without () enzymes to deglycosylate proteins. beta-actin was used as a loading control for lysates. a protein with a molecular mass of approximately 72\u201375 kDa sized band was observed in supernatants from infected cells. secreted NiV-G protein was first observed at 16 h post-infection. levels of secreted NiV-G seemed to decline by 72 h post-infection. a single application of the MVA\u2013NiV-G vaccines induced abundant levels of NiV-G-specific IgG antibodies in the mice. all vaccinated animals produced even higher levels of circulating NiV-G-specific antibodies, with the antibody titers increasing by approximately 10-fold. IFNAR/ mice on a C57BL/6 background (MHC I = H2-Db/H2-Kb (H2-b) and MHC II = H2-IAb) were immunized twice with the MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccine via the intraperitoneal route. splenocytes were prepared 8 days after the final inoculation, CD4 and CD8 T cells were purified and restimulated with overlapping 15mer peptides corresponding CD8 T cells from these mice were restimulated with the above subpools and individual peptides #1 and #2. splenic CD8 T cells were restimulated with the above subpools and individual peptides. CD8 T cells were purified by magnetic bead selection and restimulated with pools of 10\u201313 overlapping 15mer peptides of NiV-G or subpools of positive peptide pools. each cell of the matrix represents an individual 15mer peptide. differences between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. epitope within the NiV-G protein was dissected into every possible 8\u201311mer sequence. the sequences were then analyzed for H2-b binding computationally. eight of the 16 8\u201311mer overlapping peptides tested resulted in the stimulation of measurable IFN- in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group. the amino acid sequence of the positive 15mer peptide, #1, served to generate peptides with every possible 8\u201311mer sequence. Sequences were selected based on H2-b binding prediction results obtained from the SYFPEITHI database. peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) was present in all positive 10\u201311mer peptides. the sequence of peptide 8.4 (STDNQAVI) was present in the eight positive peptides. peptide 8.4 (STDNQAVI) was present in the eight positive peptides. peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) (mean = 906 109 IFN- SFC/106 cells respectively) was a potential H2-b-restricted epitope candidate of NiV-G. the alignment of peptide 9.3 to the full sequence of NiV-G is shown in Figure S3. the mean SFC values were significantly higher for the MVA\u2013NiVsG group relative to the MVA\u2013NiV-G group. the means of the MVA\u2013NiVsG group were 914 221 IFN- SFC/106 cells. the means of the MVA\u2013NiV-G group were 410 68 IFN- SFC/106 cells. the frequency and absolute number of IFN-+ CD8 T cells were significantly higher than the control background levels. the mean frequencies of IFN-+ CD8 T cells were 0.84% 14% for the MVA\u2013NiVsG group and 0.33% 0.04% for the MVA\u2013NiV-G group. the majority of peptide-specific CD8 T cells from MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiVG immunized mice were double positive for the cytokines (IFN- + TNF-+) ELISPOT and IFN- + TNF- ICS analyzed their immunogenicity after a single vaccination. the group showed IFN-+TNF-+ secreting T cells after a single vaccination. percentages were lower than what was observed after prime-boost immunization. this indicates that prime immunization was sufficient to generate a sizeable population of polyfunctional antigen-specific CD8 T cells. eight days after the final immunization, CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes or total splenocytes were restimulated and measured by IFN- ELISPOT assay or IFN- intracellular cytokine staining. T cell responses were measured by IFN- ELISPOT assay. asterisks represent statistically significant differences between two groups for a specific peptide. we performed a computational analysis of the 15mer peptides in the five most positive peptide pools measured by ELISPOT assay (pools H3, H4, V3, V6, and V9). peptide #50 (NVWTPPNPNTVYHCS) is a promising H2-IAb-restricted CD4 T cell epitope candidate of NiV-G. the alignment of the peptide to the full amino acid sequence of wild-type NiV-G is shown in Figure S3. CD8 T cells from mice immunized with MVA\u2013NiVsG showed elevated numbers of IFN- spot-forming counts (SFC) after stimulation with peptide pools V1 and H1 (H1A and H1B) peptide pools were subdivided into subpools containing 5\u20137 peptides each. IFNAR/ mice were immunized twice with 108 PFU of MVA\u2013NiVsG. mice were immunized twice with 108 PFU of MVA\u2013NiVsG. eight days after booster immunization, spleens were collected. spot-forming cells (IFN- SFC) of CD8 T cells stimulated with peptide pools. differences between groups were analyzed by one-way ANOVA. the mean values for the MVA\u2013NiVsG group were 645 112 IFN- SFC/106 cells for peptide 9.3 and 380 85 IFN- SFC/106 for peptide 8.4. groups of IFNAR/ mice (n = 2\u20134) were immunized twice with MVA\u2013NiVsG, MVA, or saline (mock) via the i.p. or intramuscular (i.m.) routes over peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) was present in all positive 10\u201311mer peptides. peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) was present in all positive 10\u201311mer peptides. eight positive peptides tested significantly stimulated the activation of IFN- in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group relative to the MVA and PBS controls. we chose peptide 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) as a potential H2-b-restricted epitope candidate of NiV-G. niV-G-specific CD8 T cells induced by MVA Candidate Vaccines Expressing NiV-G or NiVsG. the means of the MVA\u2013NiVsG group were 914 221 IFN- SFC/106 cells. the means of the MVA\u2013NiVsG group were 410 68 IFN- SFC/106 cells. total splenocytes were restimulated with the H2-b-restricted peptide of NiV-G 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) total splenocytes were restimulated with the H2-b-restricted peptide of NiV-G 9.3 (RSTDNQAVI) the percentage and absolute number of IFN-+ CD8 T cells was significantly higher in the MVA\u2013NiVsG group. the mean frequencies of IFN-+ CD8 T cells were 0.84% 14% for the MVA\u2013NiVsG group. the majority of peptide-specific CD8 T cells from MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiVG immunized mice were double positive for the cytokines. the frequency and absolute number of IFN-+ CD8 T cells was higher in the experimental groups relative to the MVA and mock controls. the mean percentage of IFN-+ CD8 T cells was 0.049% for the MVA\u2013NIV-G groups, whereas for the MVA\u2013NiVsG group, the mean percentage range for the peptides was 0.65% 0.21%. Mean IFN- SFC values above background were observed in 8 out of the 21 pools (pools H3, H4, V2, V3, V5, V6, V9, and V11) group of IFNAR/ mice (n = 2\u20137) were immunized twice with MVA\u2013NiVsG, MVA\u2013NiV-G, MVA, or saline (mock) via the i.p. or i.m. route. total splenocytes from i.m. immunized mice were restimulated with two promising candidate H2-IAb-restricted 15mer peptides. these peptides were #49 (LFMTNVWTPPNPNTV) and #50 (NVWTPPNPNTVYHCS), identified by peptide pool screening. a small population of peptide-specific IFN-+ CD4 T cells was observed in the MVA\u2013NiVsG and MVA\u2013NiV-G groups. due to low frequencies of IFN--producing cells, we chose a cut off value of 0.1% to differentiate between positive signals and background. there are some experimental NiV vaccines that have already been tested in different preclinical animal models. the major focus of these approaches was to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy in the context of NiV challenge infection. there is relatively little known about the induction and relevance of NiV-specific cellular immune responses. envelope G protein is known as the well-conserved attachment glycoprotein for both HeV and NiV. in a previous study, a recombinant adeno-associated virus vaccine expressing a full-length NiV-G protein protected hamsters in an NiV infection model. a monoclonal antibody m102.4 was derived and has already been successfully tested as a therapeutic approach in humans. recent studies indicated that NiV-G N-glycans reduce fusion efficiency. removal of some N-glycans caused cell\u2013cell hyperfusogenicity and increased viral entry. a first in vivo evaluation in mice revealed that treatment with the MVA\u2013NiV-G and MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccine resulted in the induction of similar levels of G-binding serum antibodies. antigen-specific T cells can open the blood brain barrier and contribute to virus infections of the brain [69,70,71,72,73] to allow for more detailed studies characterizing T cells in NiV-associated immunity. it is essential to identify NiV-G peptide epitopes allowing for the specific MHC-restricted antigen presentation and the activation of NiV-specific T cells. intracellularly synthetized antigen is secreted in high amounts from the MVA\u2013NiVsG-infected cells. such extracellular antigen can efficiently fuel the cross-presentation pathway and induce elevated CD8 and CD4 T cell immune responses. an MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccine may have superior immunogenicity. we also demonstrated that an MVA\u2013NiVsG candidate vaccine may have superior immunogenicity."}
