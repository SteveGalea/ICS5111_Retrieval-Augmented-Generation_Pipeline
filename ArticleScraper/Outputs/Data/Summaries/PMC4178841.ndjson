{"summary": "secreted and membrane proteins are synthesized, folded, and assembled in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) a dedicated quality control system ensures only correctly folded and assembled proteins leave the ER and are transported along the secretory pathway. a tight regulation of the ERAD capacity and its prompt adaptation to fluctuations in the ER cargo load is crucial to maintain cellular proteostasis. EDEM1 and OS-9 contribute to the delivery of misfolded polypeptides to the adaptor protein SEL1L and the HRD1 dislocation machinery. the misfolded protein is dislocated across the ER membrane, polyubiquitylated, and degraded by cytosolic proteasomes. posttranslational, client-regulated events may be crucial strategy to allow more rapid, more readily reversible, and less energy-consuming responses to variations in the cellular environment than those involving changes of gene transcription/translation. our group recently described posttranslational mechanisms controlled by the misfolded protein load in the ER and determining the ERAD capacity. unengaged HRD1 dislocons are disassembled and HERP is rapidly turned over by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. the expression of HRD1 clients maintains HRD1 dislocons in their fully assembled, functional state and inhibits the constitutively rapid HERP turnover. a substantial pool of LC3-I is also associated with membranes. autophagy gene implicated in conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II is dispensable for ERAD tuning vesicle formation. small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated knockdown of LC3 substantially inhibits this process. characterization of this ERAD tuning pathway revealed a novel, autophagy-independent role of nonlipidated LC3 (12) EDEM1, OS-9, and SEL1L colocalize with viral double-stranded RNA. this suggests that MHV hijacks the ERAD tuning vesicles for replication. equine arteritis virus (EAV) also hijacks the ERAD tuning vesicles in a manner similar to that of MHV. nsp3, -4, and -6 of coVs and their EAV homologues nsp2, -3, and -5 are synthesized in the ER and are essential for DMV formation. paired membrane structures form only when nsp3 and nsp4 are from the same virus strain. 5 and the host cell ERAD factors promote DMV formation. nsp6 might be involved in subversion of ERAD tuning vesicles at later stages. FUTURE PERSPECTIVES Infections with positive-strand RNA viruses can lead to life-threatening diseases."}
