{"summary": "CF is characterized by a chronic cycle of airway obstruction, infection, and inflammation leading to progressive loss of lung function and eventual respiratory failure. a dysfunctional cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator impairing the primary mucociliary escalator and antimicrobial chemical defenses. ta-defensin, rhesus theta-defensin-1 (RTD-1), exhibits broad antimicrobial activity, including activity against the known CF pathogens methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and P. aeruginosa. in vivo, RTD-1 improved survival in murine bacteremic sepsis and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) P. aeruginosa challenge increased release of the cytokines interleukin 1 (IL-1), TNF, IL-6, and CXCL8 by approximately 8-, 30-, 17-, and 35-fold compared to unconditioned CuFi cells. at the highest dose tested, IL-1, IL-6, and CXCL8 were reduced by approximately 1.3-fold, while TNF was observed to be reduced by approximately 2-fold. CF hBECs were stimulated with P. aeruginosa filtrate (Pa Filt) in the presence or absence of 0, 1, or 10 g/ml RTD-1 for 24 h. the levels of cytokines IL-1 (A), TNF (B), IL-6 (C) and CXCL8 (D) were quantified by ELISA. Isolated CF airway leukocytes were cultured in the presence or absence of 100 g/ml RTD-1 for 24 h. release of cytokines IL-1, TNF, CXCL8, and IL-6 was quantified by ELISA. treatment differences were analyzed by a paired t test after baseline correction. recombinant human active MMP-9 (A) and surface ADAM17 activity (B) in CF airway leukocytes measured in the presence or absence of RTD-1 at varying concentrations. NE activity in soluble-phase sputum was determined by specific fluorogenic substrate reporters. on average, DNase (1.6 M) appeared to be more potent than RTD-1 (5 M) on a molar basis, DNase (1.6 M) appeared to be more potent than RTD-1 (5 M). sham treatment with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) did not induce airway hyperresponsiveness in vivo. nebulized RTD-1 did not appear to enhance airway reactive effects. plasma levels of RTD-1 following aerosol administration were below the lower limit of quantification of 7.8 ng/ml. medians and IQRs (n = 4/group) are shown. unbalanced numbers of animals in the treatment groups were the result of spontaneous death during quarantine (n = 6/64) or from surgical complications (n = 12/64) the surviving inoculated mice were assigned to treatment groups. the effects of RTD-1 treatment on proinflammatory cytokine, chemokine, growth factor, and protease levels are summarized in Table 2. we observed a significant reduction in keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC), IL-6, TIMP-1, and total MMP-9 levels at 167 g/kg (P 0.05), but no difference at 360 g/kg RTD-1 (P > 0.05), compared to untreated controls. 784.0) 918.0 (45.14\u201318,670) 54.1e (5.5\u2013529.8) 1,042.0 (86.4\u201312,565.0) Total MMP-9b 11,640.0 (11,130.0\u201312,160.0) 8,990.0 (4,390.0\u201317,850.0) 6,133.0f (2,328.0\u20139,938.0) 10,240.0 (8,086.0\u201312,390.0) NE activityb,c 223.40 (66.78\u2013380. TNF (P 0.01), CXCL8 (P 0.01), and IL-6 (P 0.01) were observed at both 1 and 10 g/ml. at the highest dose tested, IL-1, IL-6, and CXCL8 were reduced. at the highest dose tested, IL-1, IL-6, and CXCL8 were reduced by 1.3-fold. six patients with CF who were hospitalized for treatment of an acute pulmonary exacerbation participated in the sputum inflammation study. the median admission demographics were as follows: 28 years of age, normal weight (body mass index [BMI], 23.4), and moderate lung disease. all the patients had chronic P. aeruginosa-positive respiratory cultures and were receiving treatment with azithromycin. RTD-1 inhibits lung proteases, with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of 551 nM (1.1 g/ml) RTD-1 exhibited competitive inhibition, with a Ki of 571 nM (1.2 g/ml) Alternatively, RTD-1 at 600 nM only slightly inhibited (10%) neutrophil elastase activity. a normalized response sigmoid model was used to determine IC50s. Means and SD (n = 2/group) were shown. treatment differences for NE inhibition were analyzed by ANOVA. twenty-four-hour peptide stability was evaluated in pooled soluble-phase sputa (SOL) (n = 7 patients) RTD-1's signature peak was demonstrated at a retention time (RT) of 4.8 min. peak area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) for RTD-1 alone compared to the control remained unchanged. delivery of nebulized RTD-1 was done through a 16-port nose-only nebulizer system. a 7-stage cascade impactor allowed the characterization of the mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) of nebulized RTD-1 as 0.81 0.12 M with a geometric standard deviation (SD) of 1.32 0.05.

ADAM17 enzymatic activity was quantified by continuous measurement of fluorescence intensity in a microplate fluorometer (Synergy H1 Hybrid; Bio-Tek Instruments Inc., Winooski, VT) at 37\u00b0C and at a ex of 485 nm and a em of 535 nm, in accordance with a protocol described previously (62). pooled CF sputum samples (n = 7) were processed as previously described. undiluted SOL containing extracellular enzymes was spiked with saline or RTD-1 (100 g/ml; 5% [vol/vol]) at 0 and 24 h, 10% acetic acid was added to stop all enzymatic activity. the estimated delivered dose was based on the concentration of RTD-1 in the sampled air, the respiratory-minute volume of a 25-g mouse, the duration of exposure, the inhalable fraction, and body weight. the operating parameters included the following: exposure times of 1 h for 49-, 167-, and 360-g/kg delivered doses. BAL was performed at 0.5, 1, 4, and 8 h postaerosolization (n = 4/time point) the urea correction method was used to determine RTD-1 concentrations in ELF as previously described (69). lungs were inflated and infused with 10% formalin-buffered solution. the starting inocula were 2.8 105, 2.5 105, and 5 105 for 49-, 167-, and 360-g/kg delivered doses. the animals received a 1-hour daily treatment with either aerosolized half-normal saline (n = 15) or RTD-1 (49,167, and 360 g/kg; n = 8, 12, and 11) for 7 days. an aliquot of BAL fluid and homogenized lung tissue was serially diluted. the total lung bacterial burden was calculated from the sum of colony counts. the CF P. aeruginosa RP73 clinical strain was a kind gift from Alessandra Bragonzi (71, 73) the hydrochloride salt of RTD-1 (>98%) was synthesized using Fmoc chemistry. the ratio paired t test was performed on sputum leukocyte samples. the ratio paired t test was performed on sputum leukocyte samples as the ratio (treated/control), not the difference. animal experiments were reviewed and approved by the institutional animal care and use committee at the University of Southern California. male 8- to 10-week-old BALB/c mice weighing 20 to 25 g, male and female CftrF508/F508 mice with a C57BL/6 background were housed under specific-pathogen-free conditions. filtrate was obtained from a late-stationary-phase culture of P. aeruginosa isolate RP73 grown in bronchial epithelial cell growth medium containing bronchial epithelial basal medium. the filtrate was clarified, filter sterilized (0.45 m), and heat inactivated for 10 min at 95\u00b0C before use. no cytotoxicity was observed over 24 h with or without RTD-1. a 0.5-ml aliquot of the cell suspension was placed in a 48-well cell plate. the wells were spiked with 100 g/ml RTD-1 or cell culture medium. no cytotoxicity was observed over 24 h with or without RTD-1. release of IL-1, TNF, CXCL8, and IL-6 from sputum leukocytes was quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. in vitro MMP-9 activity was measured using a fluorogenic microtiter substrate assay. in pooled expectorated SOL from stable outpatients, MMP-9 activity was determined with the above-described fluorogenic-substrate assay. data were acquired with Gen5 data analysis software (Bio-Tek Instruments Inc.) the initial velocity was computed and the Ki was estimated by the competitive enzyme inhibition model. the IC50 estimate was calculated using the normalized response sigmoidal maximum-effect (Emax) model with fixed Hill slope. cells were plated in duplicate at 1 106 cells/well with 5 m TACE II fluorogenic substrate. ADAM17 enzymatic activity was quantified by continuous measurement of fluorescence intensity in a microplate fluorometer. initial velocity was computed and imported into the dose-response analysis. the stability of RTD-1 in sputum was monitored by UPLC (210 nm) and its identity was confirmed by MS (m/z, 521.65) pooled CF sputum samples were processed as previously described. the estimated delivered dose was based on the concentration of RTD-1 in the sampled air, the respiratory-minute volume of a 25-g mouse, the duration of exposure, the inhalable fraction, and body weight. the operating parameters included: exposure times of 1 h for 49-, 167-, and 360-g/kg delivered doses. single-dose pharmacokinetics were determined in C57BL/6NCrl mice.
