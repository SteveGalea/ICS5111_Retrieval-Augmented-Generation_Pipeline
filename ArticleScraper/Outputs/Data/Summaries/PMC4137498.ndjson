{"summary": "target enrichment should preferentially amplify the target virus over host or environmental DNA/RNA, in contrast to random amplification commonly used prior to whole genome sequencing. high levels of intraspecific sequence variation combined with low virus concentrations mean that standard PCR primer design from a reference may fail due to mutations in the sample virus that prevent primer binding. most of the primer pairs could amplify >75% of isolates. each primer pair for a given region is intended to be run as a specific pair, not as a multiplex with multiple pairs. run_tiled_primers does not require manual subdivision of target sequences to be run separately by the user. the target sets included up to hundreds of sequences. consensus was extremely low, as little as 5% of the bases in multiple sequence alignment. the JCVI Primer Designer pipeline could be a labor-intensive endeavor. run_tiled_primers takes as input a multiple sequence alignment (MSA) run_tiled_primers splits the alignment into regions of size \u201cs\u201d bases that overlap by \u201cx\u201d bases. possible applications include target enrichment for viral discovery of new members in a viral family. s is increased by the amount that evenly divides the alignment without any remainder to s\u2032. optional regions file may be specified which contains regions (e.g., genes) and their start and end positions in the alignment. the PriMux software is used to search for conserved, degenerate, and multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify that region in all target sequences. in silico primer settings MHV primer settings Primer length range 18\u201325 18\u201327 T m range allowed1 60\u201365\u00b0C 58\u201365\u00b0C Number degenerate bases allowed per primer 5 3 Minimum distance of degenerate base to 3\u2032 end of primer 3 nt 3 nt Minimum trimer entropy allowed (to avoid repetitive sequence) run_tiled_primers labels each overlapping region as #part, where # indicates the order of the regions, for example, 0part, 1part, and 2part are the three regions shown in Figure 1. this is likely to happen for poorly aligning regions or regions in which there are insertions or deletions in a subset of the sequences. primers from overlapping regions can produce amplicons shorter (less than x bp) than the desired amplicon of length between s x and s bp (e.g., RP of 0part with the FP from 1part), a step to remove short amplicons before sequencing may be desired. table 1 shows average genome or segment length, number of genomes available for each target, % consensus among those sequences, and the total number of primers to amplify all overlapping regions of all genomes. all products from the nt database under 7800 bp (shorter amplicon) or 26 kb (longer amplicon) were predicted with simulate_PCR to identify potential amplification of nontarget organisms. the number of nontarget amplicons predicted in a multiplex reaction of tiled primers for 10 kb amplicons. as in Table 3, but for the multiplexes of the 10 kb-amplicon tiled primers. run_tiled_primers was used to design primers for selected regions of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (strain MHV-1) genome following lab passage. it was hoped run_tiled_primers would help avoid selecting primers in mutational hotspots by taking into account strain variation across multiple available genomes for the species. samples from MHV-1 infected mice were provided by Dr. Richard Bowen at Colorado State University. the MHV-1 strain used to infect the mice was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) mice were sacrificed four days after inoculation. multiplex \u201cA\u201d included primer sets A, C, E, G, and I and multiplex \u201cB\u201d had primer sets B, D, F, and H. without this strategy, these overlapping primer sets would dominate the PCR reaction due to the small size of these amplicons. multiplex PCR products served as templates for PCR reactions with primer pairs that included the reverse primer of one region paired with the forward primer from the downstream adjacent region. the multiplex product template was diluted 1 : 10,000 or excised from a gel and purified prior to use as a template. the PriMux software [3] is used to search for conserved, degenerate, and multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify that region in all target sequences. the PriMux \u201cmax\u201d algorithm is used to search for conserved, degenerate, and multiplex compatible primer sets to amplify that region in all target sequences. primer settings Primer length range 18\u201325 18\u201327 T m range allowed1 60\u201365\u00b0C 58\u201365\u00b0C Number degenerate bases allowed per primer 5 3 Maximum length of homopolymer allowed 4 nt 5 nt GC% range allowed 20\u201380 20\u201380 Minimum primer dimer G 6 kcal/mol 15 kcal/mol Minimum hairpin G 5 kcal/mol 12 kcal/mol Primer selection iterations 1 3 1 T m is run_tiled_primers labels each overlapping region as #part. this is likely to happen for poorly aligning regions or regions in which there are insertions or deletions in a subset of the sequences. the length of the MSA is much larger than the average genome length. primers of overlapping regions can also produce amplicons shorter (less than x bp) than the desired amplicon of length between s x and s bp. a step to remove short amplicons before sequencing may be desired. all products from the nt database under 7800 bp (shorter amplicon) or 26 kb (longer amplicon) were predicted with simulate_PCR to identify potential amplification of nontarget organisms. Counts show the number of unique primer combinations in a multiplex that yield products for any sequence in the NCBI nucleotide database. 86 \u2014 Junin_L 0/69 \u2014 Machupo_L 0/153 \u2014 Junin_S 0/84 \u2014 Machupo_S 0/32 \u2014 JEV 7/9515 Rocio West Nile NW_Arena_S 56/1543 Ippy Lassa Luna Lymphocytic choriomeningitis Mobala Mopeia NW_Arena_L 0/819 \u2014 OW_Arena run_tiled_primers was used to design primers for selected regions of the coronavirus murine hepatitis virus (strain MHV-1) genome following lab passage. it was hoped that run_tiled_primers would help avoid selecting primers in mutational hotspots by taking into account strain variation across multiple available genomes. the MHV-1 strain used to infect the mice was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) mice were sacrificed four days after inoculation and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid was collected.

MHV Results Multiplexed primers were tested in the lab as primer pairs in individual reactions then as multiplexed reactions. in some cases extra bands were present, but they were generally smaller than the targeted size. software is described to generate tiled, multiplex, and degenerate amplification primers. applications include target enrichment for viral discovery of new members in a viral family from a complex host background. applications include target enrichment for viral discovery of new members in a viral family from a complex host background."}
