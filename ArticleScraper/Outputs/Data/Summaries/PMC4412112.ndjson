{"summary": "the ligand of CD200R, CD200 (OX2), is broadly expressed by cells of hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic origins. the primary function of the CD200R pathway is to limit immune reactivity. the CD200R pathway negatively regulates myeloid cell homeostasis in the periphery. MCMV UL119\u2013121 proteins display homology to human CD200 [20], although it is currently unknown whether they induce inhibitory signaling through CD200R. many herpesviruses encode functional CD200 orthologs (vCD200s) imply that exploitation of this inhibitory pathway is potentially advantageous for herpesviruses. wild type C57BL/6 (wt) and CD200R-/- mice were infected with MCMV. peak acute MCMV replication at day 4 post-infection was unaltered by CD200R deficiency. however, CD200R-/- mice exhibited reduced burden of replicating virus in the spleen 7 days pi. replicating virus is first detectable in the SGs at day 7 pi. wt and CD200R-/- mice day 7 pi were comparable. CD200R-/- mice restricted persistent MCMV replication in the SGs 14 days pi. IL-10 induces CD200R expression by macrophages in vitro [18, 31] MCMV-infected IL-10-/- mice exhibited no alterations in CD200R expression by myeloid cells during infection. CD200R was expressed during infection but was not significantly upregulated in response to MCMV, either an IL-10-dependent or independent mechanism. CD200 is expressed during in vivo MCMV infection. CD31 (green) and CD200 (red) co-localization in SGs. MCMV infection of macrophages up-regulates CD200. eloid cell populations in vitro using a multiplicity of infection of 1 that leads to an infection efficiency of less than 60%. infection of bone marrow-derived macrophages (BM-DM, Fig.3A\u2013C) and splenic macrophages (Fig.3B) up-regulated CD200. MCMV induces CD200 expression by macrophages. infected, MCMV-exposed and IE3 MCMV-infected BM-DMs compared to expression by mock-infected cells. results represent 2\u20135 experiments. BM-DMs were infected or not with influenza strain PR8 (MOI:1). IE3 knockout replication-deficient MCMV induced a small, transient induction of CD200 mRNA in an IFN-dependent manner. replicating MCMV induced substantial and prolonged CD200 mRNA expression independently of IFN. bone marrow chimeras were derived from wt mice or mice deficient of CD200. we then studied virus load in SGs 14 days post-MCMV infection. CD200 expressed by hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells facilitate MCMV persistence. SG-APC accumulation in infected CD200R-/- mice was substantially increased 14 days pi. however, SG-APC numbers were comparable in wt and CD200R-/- mice following resolution of MCMV infection. CD200R restricts myeloid cell accumulation and SG-APC proliferation. MHC II (green) expressing cells adjacent to large CD200+ (red) endothelial cells. sections were counterstained with TOTO-3 (blue) to detect DNA. SG-APC proliferation was further elevated in CD200R-/- mice. CD4 T cells limit virus persistence in CD200R-/- mice CD4 T cells are critical effector cells in the control of MCMV persistence that afford protection via expression of IFN. despite the absence of measurable T cell expression of CD200R-/- mice, SG-infiltrating CD4 T cells in CD200R-/- mice exhibited increased activation. elevated splenic DC numbers 14 days pi in CD200R-/- mice were accompanied by an increase in virus-specific CD4 T cells in this organ at this time. these data therefore suggested that CD200R restricted peripheral and mucosal CD4 T cell responsiveness during virus persistence through localized regulation of tissue APC accumulation. specific CD4 T cells were enumerated in the spleen over a time-course. results represent the mean and SEM of 4\u20136 mice/group. SGs were harvested 14 days pi and virus load assessed by plaque assay. MCMV titres in the spleen (A), liver (B) and SGs (C) were measured 4 and 7 (A&B) or 7, 14 and 33 (C) days pi. individual mice and median are shown. CD200R-/- mice restricted persistent MCMV replication in the SGs 14 days pi. more CD200R-/- mice cleared MCMV by day 33 pi. CD200R expression by SG myeloid cells was notably higher than splenic counterparts. infected SGs, CD200+ cells were predominantly large CD31+ cells. CD200+ cells did not express alpha smooth muscle actin. a more scarce population of CD200+CD45+ cells also detected. gG2a-Biotin and EpCAM (Rabbit IgG) and the secondary antibodies Streptavidin 555 and Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit IgG (Bottom). MCMV infection of macrophages up-regulated CD200. MCMV induces CD200 expression by macrophages. BM-DMs were infected with pSM3fr MCMV. BM-DMs were infected with pSM3fr MCMV. BM-DMs were treated with (E) polyI:C or infected with (F) replication deficient IE3 MCMV or (G) wt MCMV (pSM3fr) and cd200 expression was assessed by microarray. protein expression by uninfected macrophages derived from infected cells. inhibition of viral DNA polymerase with phosphonoacetic acid (PAA) antagonized MCMV-induced CD200 expression in BM-DMs. MCMV infection of splenic DCs did not further induce CD200 expression. CD200 expressed by hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cells facilitate MCMV persistence. wt/CD200-/- bone marrow chimeras were generated and infected with MCMV. 14 days later, replicating virus load in the SGs was assessed by plaque assay. CD200R restricts myeloid cell accumulation and SG-APC proliferation. time-course of accumulation of splenic CD11c+MHC II+ cells in wt and CD200R-/- mice. Mean + SEM of 4\u201311 mice/group is shown. in nave wt and CD200R-/- mice, infection-induced SG-APC proliferation was further elevated in CD200R-/- mice compared to wt mice day 7 pi. increased SG-APC accumulation in CD200R-/- mice was a consequence of heightened proliferation. CD25hi CD4 T cells exhibited increased activation, indicated by CD69 and CD25 up-regulation 10 days pi. CD69 expression by SG CD4 T cells was elevated by 14 days pi. elevated splenic DC numbers 14 days pi in CD200R-/- mice showed increased activation. data depicted as histogram overlays (A) and percent expression by individual mice + mean (B) results represent the mean and SEM of 4\u20136 mice/group, representing 2 experiments. depletion of CD4 T cells abrogated the improved control of MCMV in CD200R-/- mice. MCMV exploits the CD200-CD200R pathway to restrict mucosal antiviral immunity in vivo. CD200R-mediated restriction of SG-APC proliferation reduces CD4 T cell activation within the SGs, subsequently impairing CD4 T cell responsiveness. MCMV replication continued at the time-points at which CD69+ CD4 T cells were detected in our study. improved control of MHV infection in CD200-/- mice was associated with elevated type I IFN. MCMV-infected CD200R-/- mice exerts potent antiviral activity against MCMV in vivo in wt mice. non-hematopoietic cells expressed CD200 during MCMV infection. splenic macrophages up-regulated CD200 following MCMV infection in vitro. MCMV does not exploit macrophage expression of CD200 to deliver an autocrine inhibitory signal. MCMV induced myeloid cell CD200 expression via two distinct mechanisms. incomplete virus replication triggered TLR-induced Cd200 gene expression in macrophages independently of this pathway. inhibition of viral DNA polymerase during HCMV infection also incompletely inhibits production of certain viral proteins. our study highlights a central role for myeloid cells in modulating cytomegalovirus-specific T cell responses in mucosal tissue. MCMV exploits CD200R signaling to antagonize myeloid cell orchestration of antiviral immunity to promote persistence within and dissemination from the mucosa. mice were infected with MCMV 8 weeks after irradiation. leukocyte isolation and flow cytometry SGs and spleens were surgically excised. spleens were surgically excised from mice euthanized with carbon dioxide. to detect MCMV-specific CD4 T cells, leukocytes were incubated with 3g MCMV peptides (Genscript) for 6 hours, with BFA (Sigma) for the final 4 hours. data was acquired on a BD FACS Canto II. phages were infected with MCMV or influenza (PR8) at an MOI of 1. some cells were incubated with 300g/ml phosphonoacetic acid (PAA, Sigma-Aldrich) for 1 hour.
