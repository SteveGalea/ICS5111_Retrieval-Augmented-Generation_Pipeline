{"summary": "isolation precautions for all ICU patients with MRSA colonization are essential. the nurse tells you that it is essential that the patient be moved to a single room, the door be closed, and entrance into the room be monitored. many studies have reported significantly better control using surveillance cultures and contact precautions. studies have not been conducted regarding the surveillance cultures/contact precautions approach to MRSA control. a recent unrandomized study reported a statistically significant increase in some adverse effects among MRSA isolation patients (mostly falls, pressure sores, and fluid/electrolyte disorders) but no increase in numerous other types of adverse effects or deaths. isolation precautions for all ICU patients with MRSA colonization are not essential. this suggests that control of nosocomial MRSA infections is still possible and as important as it ever was. isolation/cohort nursing were in all but one case introduced as part of a varied package of measures. the prevalence of MRSA is an important part of the equation. 60% of ICUs in Germany reporting no MRSA, compared with 11.4% acquiring MRSA in ICU in Australia and 16.2% in UK ICUs [16-18]. isolation often necessitates moving critically ill patients, with well recognized associated risks. no studies have specifically addressed the efficacy of single room isolation. but our study [20] throws new light on current recommendations. it highlights the continued importance of universal precautions."}
