{"summary": "the first mechanistic model of malaria transmission was a mathematical model developed by Ronald Ross in a series of papers published between 1908 and 1921 (9\u201311), pre-dating the work of Reed and Frost. this model had a direct message for public health: malaria could be controlled and even eliminated through mosquito control, even if the vector could not be completely eliminated. if we vaccinate a proportion of the population equivalent to 1 1/R0, then the pathogen will fail to spread in that population. this is the critical vaccination threshold, and it has helped to set vaccination goals for a number of diseases, especially when elimination is the goal. mechanistic models have been used to understand the optimal age range for vaccination campaigns (19, 20), how such campaigns should be timed (21), and how best to use vaccines when supplies are limited (20, 22) the poster child for the phenomenon is congenital rubella syndrome (CRS) mechanistic models have played an important role in setting recommendations for the introduction of a rubella vaccine. these recommendations encourage countries to wait to introduce the vaccine until measles vaccination rates are high enough to guarantee a reduction in CRS cases. a key difference between microparasite and macroparasite dynamics is the huge variation in transmission potential of human hosts. t al. (37) used a state-space model (i.e., a hidden Markov model) to estimate global mortality from measles infection. they compared an underlying model of measles epidemic dynamics (the process model) with nationally reported measles incidence via an observation model (38) the prime example of an infectious disease black swan is the 1918 influenza pandemic, which is estimated to have killed 50\u2013100 million people in 2 years. groups considered how the impact of a pandemic could be mitigated in the u.s. if the initial containment attempt was unsuccessful (42\u201344) the efforts of independent groups showed that something more than social-distancing measures would be needed to control a pandemic. in part on the basis of this work, the united states and other countries decided to stockpile antivirals to combat a future pandemic. mechanistic models are one of the first tools used to characterize the threat and plan a response. when a pandemic influenza strain emerged in 2009, it was critical to quickly assess whether it had the potential to cause illness with high rates of fatality. initial assessments relied heavily on dynamic models of a variety of types. a model released by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention predicted that, without further intervention, 1.4 million cases of Ebola would occur in Liberia and Sierra Leone by mid-january 2015 (58). the authors noted that such long-term projections were tenuous, but the media and many in the public health community made much of this number. onavirus was successfully contained, whereas influenza, HIV, and many others were not. they presented evidence that a critical determinant of the controllability of a pathogen is the amount of transmission that occurs before symptom onset. forecasting includes not only projections into the future but also casting of incidence based on more readily available information. mechanistic models are often useful in trial design or interpretation of results. cluster randomization and adjustment for intra-class correlation can be used to account for this effect in some cases. infectious disease models play a critical role in incorporating indirect effects that can vary substantially across alternative programs. a logistical analysis can assess the feasibility of novel disease-control strategies, showing whether they are practical and efficacious. a powerful new synergy is the combination of mechanistic models of disease spread with phylogenetic techniques outlining the evolutionary relationship between infecting pathogens. genetic sequence data present samples of pathogens taken from a large population of pathogens both within a host and among all hosts. in future work, we expect to see more direct integration of models with data at both population scales. the use of mechanistic models in infectious disease epidemiology has shifted over the course of the course of the 20th century. the arc of their use spans beginnings as 1 of a group of statistical and mathematical tools used by epidemiologists to understand a multitude of phenomena. this arc of their use spans beginnings as 1 of a group of statistical and mathematical tools used by epidemiologists to understand a multitude of phenomena."}
