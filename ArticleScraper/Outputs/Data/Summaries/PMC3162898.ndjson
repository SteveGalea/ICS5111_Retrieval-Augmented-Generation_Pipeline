{"summary": "glial activation promotes the release of potentially toxic acute phase reactants such as TNF and nitric oxide into the extracellular space. the effects of virus-induced glial activation on oligodendrocytes are not fully understood. microglia and astrocytes have been shown to possess immune surveillance properties. the central nervous system is considered immune privileged, but is not without a functional defense system. however, both resident microglia and astrocytes have been shown to possess immune surveillance properties. idylic acid (poly(I:C)) causes release of soluble molecules with neuroprotective properties. over-activation of TLRs in absence of immunoregulation may be detrimental to the surrounding tissue. viral infections or aberrant inflammation are known to contribute to both animal and human demyelinating diseases. direct viral infection of glial cultures provides a relevant tool to model CNS viral-induced pathogenesis and/or tropism. however, infection of CNS-derived cultures with live virus often makes it difficult to separate virus-induced cytopathic effect (i.e. cell lysis) from bystander effects of activated glia. all experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. cells were washed twice with DMEM containing 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum and 1% penicillin-streptomycin. microglia were isolated by shaking the mixed glia-containing flasks for 1 h. single cell suspensions from rat spleens were used as a positive control. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 min. red blood cells were lysed with ammonium chloride (0.01 M) in PBS for 3 min at 24\u00b0C. ELISA kits were used to extract RNA according to manufacturer's instructions. RNA was digested by incubating RNA samples with DNase I for 15 min at room temperature followed by DNase inactivation at 65\u00b0C for 10 min. the samples were reverse transcribed to cDNA using the reverse transcription system kit (Promega, Madison, WI) the purity of the monocultures was determined using specific primers for GFAP (astrocyte marker) and Iba-1 (microglia marker) cell viability was assessed using both immunocytochemical and biochemical techniques. effects of treatment on preOL viability in mixed glial cultures were determined 48 h after treatment with Pam3CSK4 (1.0 g/ml; InvivoGen, San Diego, CA), poly(I:C) (50 g/ml and 5 g/ml); LPS (1.0 and 0.1 g/ml); or R848 (5.0 g/ml; InvivoGen, San cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 16000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. total proteins (20 g) were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. membranes were washed 3-5 times with TBS-T containing 5% non-fat milk. SF2/J, C57BL/6J, and TNFR1-/- mice were housed under constant 12 h light/dark cycles in covered cages and fed with a standard rodent diet ad libitum. all experimental procedures were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and were performed in accordance with guidelines of the National Institutes of Health. microglia were isolated by shaking the mixed glia-containing flasks for 1 h at 200 rpm. single cell suspensions from rat spleens were used as a positive control for TLR3 western blot analysis. cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 1500 g for 5 min. ELISA kits were used to measure intracellular cytokine staining of TNF. cells were washed twice with media, then treated with media, PBS, poly(I:C) for 8 or 24 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were then fixed and immunostained as described above. RNA was digested by incubating RNA samples with DNase I for 15 min at room temperature followed by DNase inactivation at 65\u00b0C for 10 min according to manufacturer's instructions. the purity of the mono-cultures was determined using specific primers for astrocyte marker and Iba-1 (microglia marker) products were electrophorezed on 2% agarose gels and visualized under UV light using a bio-Rad Chemidoc XRS gel documentation system and Quantity-one software. PCR was used to determine fold increase in CCL2 and CCL5 relative to -actin using the formula 2-Ct as described previously. effects of treatment in pure preOL cultures were assessed using both immunocytochemical and biochemical techniques. astrocyte and oligodendrocyte monocultures were used to determine the presence of TLR3 protein. cells were lysed on ice in standard lysis buffer (10 mM Na2P2O7, 10 mM NaF, 100 mM Na3VO4 100 mM PMSF proteinase inhibitor cocktail; Roche) and then sonicated. poly(I:C) stimulates microglia and induces pre-oligodendrocyte cell death in mixed glial cultures. poly(I:C) stimulation causes microglia activation and preOL cell death. poly(I:C) stimulation in mixed glial cultures is toxic to preOLs. poly(I:C) mediated reduction in preOL viability is dose-dependent. mixed glial cultures were stimulated with vehicle (sterile PBS; 5 l/ml), poly(I:C) (5 and 50 g/ml), or LPS (positive control; 0.1 and 1.0 g/ml) for 48 h. poly(I:C) stimulation was not directly toxic to preOLs. but poly(I:C) treatment appeared to result in increased viability. this effect was not statistically significant. mixed glial cultures derived from WT, TNF-/- or TNFR1-/- were stimulated with vehicle (sterile PBS; 5 l/ml), poly(I:C) (50 g/ml), or LPS (1.0 g/ml) for 48 h. both TNF production and TNFR1 are required for poly(I:C)-induced preOL death in mixed glial cultures. microglia, astrocytes or oligodendrocytes produced TNF following poly(I:C) stimulation. the signal needed to induce cell death is dependent on TNFR1. microglia are the sole source of TNF secretion after poly(I:C) stimulation in cultures challenged with poly(I:C) or LPS. microglia produce TNF following poly(I:C) stimulation. expression of TLR3 (top), TNF, IL-1, IL-6, Iba-1 and GFAP (bottom) was determined by RT-PCR from monocultures treated with PBS or poly(I:C) for 24 h. results are representative of 3 independent experiments for each product. results are representative of 2 independent experiments. results are means SEM from duplicate (CCL2) or triplicate (CCL5) samples. results are means SEM from duplicate (CCL2) or triplicate (CCL5) samples. astrocytes respond to poly(I:C) and produce chemokines while at the same time fail to transcribe TNF. stimulation of mixed glial cultures with poly(I:C) causes toxicity to preOLs. stimulation of mixed glial cultures with other TLR ligands causes toxicity to preOLs. mixed glia were stimulated for 48 h with various TLR ligands and TNF measured from culture supernatants. results are combined means SEM from 4 independent experiments. poly(I:C) stimulates microglia and induces pre-oligodendrocyte cell death in mixed glial cultures. poly(I:C) stimulation in mixed glial cultures is toxic to preOLs. poly(I:C) stimulation in mixed glial cultures causes microglia activation. results from B-D are combined means SEM of 4-5 independent experiments. poly(I:C) mediated reduction in preOL viability is dose-dependent. mixed glial cultures were stimulated with vehicle (sterile PBS; 5 l/ml), poly(I:C) (5 and 50 g/ml), or LPS (positive control; 0.1 and 1.0 g/ml) for 48 h. poly(I:C) stimulation appeared to result in increased viability. but this effect was not statistically significant. we used LPS as a positive control. mixed glial cultures derived from WT, TNF-/- or TNFR1-/- were stimulated with vehicle (sterile PBS; 5 l/ml), poly(I:C) (50 g/ml), or LPS (1.0 g/ml) for 48 h. both TNF production and TNFR1-/- are required for poly(I:C)-induced preOL death in mixed glial cultures. microglia are the sole source of TNF secretion after poly(I:C) stimulation in cultures challenged with poly(I:C) or LPS. microglia, but neither astrocytes nor oligodendrocytes produced TNF following poly(I:C) stimulation. the signal needed to induce cell death is dependent on TNFR1. microglia produce TNF following poly(I:C) stimulation. expression of TLR3 (top), TNF, IL-1, IL-6, Iba-1 and GFAP (bottom) was determined by RT-PCR from monocultures treated with PBS or poly(I:C) for 24 h. results are representative of 3 independent experiments for each product. results are representative of 2 independent experiments. results are means SEM from duplicate (CCL2) or triplicate (CCL5) samples. results are means SEM from duplicate (CCL2) or triplicate (CCL5) samples. chemokines CCL2 and CCL5 have been previously reported to be substantially induced in astrocytes following extracellular poly(I:C) stimulation. astrocytes respond to poly(I:C) and produce chemokines while at the same time fail to transcribe TNF. stimulation of mixed glial cultures with poly(I:C) causes toxicity to preOLs. TNF production in mixed glial cultures stimulated with TLR agonists Stimulus TLR ligand TNF (pg/ml) significance control N/A 36.14 3.112 Pam3CSK4 TLR1/2 1865 353.5 p 0.01 poly(I:C) stimulation of mixed glial cultures with the viral mimic poly(I:C) causes preOL death in a non-cell autonomous fashion and through a TNF/TNFR1-dependent mechanism. astrocytes express TLR3 [7,15,32-34], RIG-I [10,35] and MDA-5 [11] and have been shown to produce TNF in vivo [36-39]. astrocytes and oligodendroglial TNFR1 are required for TNF-mediated oligodendrocyte toxicity in vitro. astrocytes and oligodendroglial TNFR1 are also required for TNF-mediated oligodendrocyte toxicity in vitro. poly(I:C) injection into the substantia nigra pars compacta causes microglia activation and demyelination. stereotaxic injection of zymosan into the corpus callosum [20] or spinal cord [21] induces demyelination. some microglial responses can in fact promote tissue repair. bral injection of TNF resulted in hemorrhage, reactive gliosis and infiltration of mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells. mice exhibit delayed demyelination but also impaired remyelination. anti-TNF therapy has been associated with the onset of monophasic demyelination. increased susceptibility to MS is associated with a single nucleotide polymorphism within the sixth intron of the tnfr1 gene. the current study tested the hypothesis that stimulation of mixed glia with the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) would exhibit different outcomes than those following LPS stimulation. authors declare that they have no competing interests. authors' contributions JL and AJS designed the study. all authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
