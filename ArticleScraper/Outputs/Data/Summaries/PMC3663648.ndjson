{"summary": "the consequence of human infection varies markedly among different subtypes of avian influenza viruses. the difference in host cellular response is likely to play a critical role. results showed that dysregulation of miRNA expression was mainly observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 infection. the naive host immune system cannot be the sole explanation. infection of other avian influenza viruses, e.g. H9N2, only results in mild infections. the cellular pathway leading to such adverse outcome is unknown. 36 pig-encoded miRNAs and 22 human-encoded miRNAs were found to have putative targets in swine influenza virus and Swine-Origin 2009 A/H1N1 influenza virus genes. miR-323, miR-491 and miR-654 could inhibit replication of H1N1 influenza A virus through binding to the conserved region of the PB1 gene. cellular miRNAs were also implicated in the lethal infections of mice with a highly miR-141, miR-181c*, miR-210, miR29b, miR-324-5p, and miR-663 were up-regulated (>1.5-fold, p0.05) at 3-hour post-infection with subtype H5 as compared with non-infected control cells. at 18 and 24-hour post-infection, miR-923, miR-1246, miR-574-3p, and miR-663 were up-regulated (>3- miR-939 were found to be up-regulated (>1.5-fold, p0.05) miRNAs differentially expressed in H1N1 and H5N1 infected NCI-H292 cells at different time points, respectively. 3-hour Fold-change Regulation 6-hour Fold-change Regulation 24-hour Fold-change Regulation hsa-miR-141 1.51 up hsa-miR-663 1.59 up hsa-miR-188-5p 1.57 hsa-miR-19a 1.52 up hsa-miR-21* 1.7 up hsa-miR-301a 1.53 up hsa-miR-572 1.5 up hsa-miR-720 1.99 up hsa-miR-939 1.51 up hsa-miR-181c* 1.53 down B. hsa-miR-141 1.9 up hsa hsa-miR-134 2.78 up hsa-miR-197 1.64 down hsa-miR-454 2.32 down hsa-miR-18a 2.15 down hsa-miR-188-5p 2.49 up hsa-miR-339-3p 1.925 down hsa-miR-1915 2.84 up hsa-miR-574-3p 1.77 down hs miR-23a, miR-574-3p and miR-574-5p were down-regulated (>=2-fold, p0.05) at 3-hour post-infection, miR-126, miR-20a*, miR-362-5p, miR-378, miR-454, and miR574-5p were found to be down-regulated (>1.5-fold, p0.05) in H1N1 infected cells. the degree of up-regulation was more prominent in H5N1 infection (5 to 14 folds) than in H1N1 infection (1.5 to 3 folds)(p*0.05) the degree of down-regulation was also higher in H5N1 infection than in H1N1 infection (Figure 1). miR-141 sequence is: 3\u2032- GGUAGAAAUGGUCUCUCACAAU - 5\u2032. that of TGF-2 3\u2032UTR is: 5\u2032-AGAGCCUUGUCAUCAGUGUUA-3\u2032. potential targets of selected miRNA: miR-21*, miR-100*, miR-141, miR-1274a, miR-1274b, and miR-574 -3p. alpha-induced protein 3 TNFAIP8L2 tumor necrosis factor, alpha-induced protein 8-like 2 IL1RAPL1 interleukin 1 receptor accessory protein-like 1 BCLAF1 BCL2-associated transcription factor 1 MiR-141 represses the expression of TGF-2 mRNA. the level of TGF-2 mRNA was significantly decreased in miR-141 transfected cells. the mean fold-changes of TGF-2 mRNA level was compared to that of negative control SD (p* 0.05). the effect of inhibition of miR-141 in influenza A virus infection was assessed using miRNA inhibitors. RNA levels and fold-changes were calculated by CT method as compared with non-infection cell control (mock) each point on the graph respresents the mean fold-changes. the experimental mean fold-changes of mRNA and protein levels were compared to that of mock controls SD. for H1N1 infected cells, miR-188-5p, miR-1260, miR-1274a, miR-1274b, miR183*, miR-18b, miR-19a, miR21*, miR-301a, miR-572, miR-720, and miR-939 were found to be up-regulated (>1.5-fold, p0.05) has-miR-141 1.9 up hsa-miR-483-3p 3.06 up hsa-miR-188-5p 2.01 up hsa-miR-1181 2.6 up hsa-miR-181c* 1.53 down. hsa-miR-let-7b* 2.02 up hsa-miR-210 1.5 up hsa-miR-126 2.2 down h miR-1225-5p 2.44 up hsa-miR-324-5p 1.759 up hsa-miR-362-5p 2.6 down hsa-miR-1274b 4.61 down hsa-miR-1246 4.39 up hsa-miR-663 2.01 up hsa-miR-378 2.16 down hsa-miR-134 2.78 up hsa-mi down hsa-miR-1280 3.01 down hsa-miR-21* 4 down hsa-miR-221 2.72 down hsa-miR-455-3p 2.16 down. miR-574-5p was down-regulated (>=2-fold, p0.05) in H5N1 infected cells. miR-15a*, miR-1825, miR-183*, miR-34b, miR-4 similar changes in miRNA profiles were observed in both H1N1 and H5N1 infected cells. however, the magnitude of fold-changes which occurred in H1N1 infection were much lower than that in H5N1 infection. target prediction of the miRNA expression profile. target genes involved in the inflammatory response and cell death pathways. miR-141 sequence is: 3\u2032- GGUAGAAAUGGUCUCUCACAAU - 5\u2032. alpha-1 chain precursor (IL-13R-alpha-1) CYTL1 Cytokine-like protein 1 precursor IL18RAP Interleukin-18 receptor accessory protein precursor miR-141 CXCL12 chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand 12 (stromal cell-derived factor 1) TGFB2 transforming growth factor, beta 2 CRLF3 cytokine receptor-like factor 3 IFNAR1 interferon (alpha, beta and omega) receptor the TGF-2 3\u2032UTR is regulated by miR-141. NCI-H292 cells were transfected with pre-miR-141 and negative control respectively. fold-changes were calculated by CT method as compared with negatively transfected cell control and using -actin level for normalization. qRT-PCR were used to quantitify the TGF-2 mRNA levels. fold-changes were calculated by CT method as compared with non-infection cell control. each point on the graph respresents the mean fold-changes. miR-1246, miR-663 and miR-574-3p were up-regulated (>3-fold, p0.05) in infection with subtype H5. many of the virally regulated miRNAs have altered regulation in some cellular defense and some states of cellular differentiation. the time point of 24-hour post-transfection or post-infection was chosen for evaluation because miR-141 induction was observed at the early stage of virus infection. the altered miR-141 expression would affect the expression of the cytokine- TGF-2. previous studies of miR-141 were mainly on its role in cancer. the effect of miR-141 on virus infection was not known, except one recent report showing that enterovirus can induce miR-141 and contribute to the shutoff of host protein translation by targeting the translation initiation factor eIF4E [30]. we found that mRNA was suppressed in miR-141 overexpressed cells. mRNA degradation induced by miR-141 may be much faster than that of the corresponding protein degradation. a result of the higher amount of miR-141 in H5N1 infection, TGF-2 expression might be more greatly reduced than that in H1N1 infection. in real bronchial environments, lung epithelial cells are the key target of influenza viruses. after these cells are infected, they will activate an inflammatory cascade. this launches a quick antimicrobial reaction and directs adaptive immunity to mount a protective response. miRNA microarrays that we used did not contain probes for every known miRNA. dysregulation of miRNA expression is mainly observed in highly pathogenic avian influenza infection. fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 g/mL streptomycin were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified air.
