{"summary": "etiological epidemiology and diagnosis are important issues in adult community-acquired pneumonia. large-scale epidemiological investigations of adult viral CAP in china are lacking. etiology and diagnosis are important issues in adult CAP, with particular challenges in identifying the causative pathogens based on patient clinical features. if clinicians do not consider a viral etiology in patients with CAP, they would be unlikely to consider investigations to diagnose respiratory viruses. antibiotic resistance is a serious issue in china, as 24.9% of the S. pneumoniae has been found to be resistant to penicillin and 87.5% to macrolide. the macrolide resistance rate of mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae, MP) in adults has been estimated at 69% [11]. patients agreed to participate in this investigation and accepted the laboratory tests and etiological examination voluntarily. patients were excluded if they were HIV infected or under an immunosuppressed state, had clinical symptoms for more than 1 week from the time of onset, were hospitalized within the prior 90 days, lived in a nursing home or rehabilitation hospital, or had been previously treated with antivirals. sample collection A single throat swab was collected from each study patient. the swab was immediately placed in a virus transport media tube. each sample was frozen at 80\u00b0C within 24 h. patients were instructed to produce a deep expectoration. quantitative real-time fluorescence PCR was used for detection of M. pneumoniae in throat swabs. DNA and RNA were extracted from samples using the QIAamp DNA Mini kit. extracted RNA was used as template to perform reverse transcriptase chain reaction. all PCR products, markers and negative control were analyzed by electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide. the PCR reaction was carried out using a quantitative PCR instrument (ABI Prism 7500, USA) Discrete variables were expressed as counts (percentage) and continuous variables as means SD or median (interquartile range) for data not normally distributed, the Mann\u2013Whitney U test was used if only two groups were compared. a probability of P 0.05 was considered statistically significant. study subjects were from the outpatient department of infectious diseases or respiratory diseases of these 12 hospitals. at least 20,000 CAP patients are seen annually. CAP was defined by a new infiltrate on a chest X-ray examined by two radiologists. sample collection a single throat swab was collected from each study patient. the swab was immediately placed in a virus transport media tube. each sample was frozen at 80\u00b0C within 24 h until analyzed. ten milliliters of blood was obtained and inoculated into two culture bottles (5 mL was inoculated into an aerobic bottle and 5 mL into an anaerobic bottle) thirty minutes later, an additional 10 mL of blood was obtained from a different site. total RNA (8 l), random hexamers (1 l of 0.2 g/l) and DEPC-treated water (3 l) were added to an RT tube on ice. 5 RT buffer (4 l), 10 mm dNTP (2 l), RNase inhibitor (1 l of 20 U/l) and reverse transcriptase (1 l of 200 U/l) were added to the tube. after chilling on ice, the complementary DNA (cDNA) the PCR reaction was carried out using a quantitative PCR instrument (ABI Prism 7500, USA) with the following conditions: 93\u00b0C for 2 min, followed by 10 cycles of 93\u00b0C for 45 sec and 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and another 30 cycles of 93\u00b0C for 0.5 min and 55\u00b0C for 10 min. the removal probability for multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis was 0.1. discriminatory analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were used to build and assess the predictive etiological diagnostic models.

hRV, 9.6% (21/219) and 1.8% (4/219); AdV, 9.1% (20/219) and 2.3% (5/219); PIV, 7.8% (17/219) and 6.8% (15/219); hMPV CAP patients infected with M. pneumoniae were significantly younger than those with viruses or bacteria. expectoration was more common in bacterial CAP patients compared with the other two groups. the predictive diagnostic model of viral CAP included cough, dyspnea, absence of chest pain and WBC count (4.0-10.0) 109/L. the sensitivity and specificity of this model were 37.4% (95% CI: 29.1% to 45.7%) and 77.2% (95% CI: 71.5% to 82.9%), respectively (P 0.05). 94 0.92 0.97 0.001 Coexisting disease 0.33 0.09 1.21 0.094 Predictive dagnostic model of M. pneumoniae CAP Univariate logistic analysis was performed with all variables in Tables 1, 2 and 3 for M. pneumoniae CAP. two independent factors with P 0.1 associated with M. pneumoniae CAP were identified, namely age (OR 0.94, P 0.05) and coexisting disease (OR 0.33, P 0.1) the incidence of CAP due to atypical pathogens from 4,337 patients worldwide between September 1996 to April 2004 was found to be 22% [18] another multicenter study on pathogenic agents in 665 adult patients with CAP in china between December 2003 to November 2004 showed that M. pneumoniae was the most common type of pathogen (20.7%) mixed infections have been reported in many previous studies. in our current investigation, 13.4% of study patients had mixed infections. but interactions between different pathogens in vivo are poorly understood. the predictive etiological diagnostic model of viral CAP consisted of cough, dyspnea, mild chest pain and WBC counts (4.0 -10.0) 109/L. factors for the predictive etiological diagnostic model of viral CAP included being younger than 45 years old. the distribution of CAP-associated pathogens in adults was consistent with trends from other etiological studies showing that bacterial CAP is decreasing, while CAP-associated respiratory viruses and M. pneumoniae are increasing. flu A virus was found to be the most prevalent from November 2010 to March 2011. our results highlight the fact that it is necessary to conduct pathological examinations for bacteria but also for viruses and M. pneumoniae for etiological diagnosis of CAP patients. authors declare that they have no competing interests.
