{"summary": "background Classical scrapie in sheep is a fatal neurodegenerative disease associated with the conversion of PrPC to PrPSc. different proteomic techniques have been used during the last decade to investigate differences in protein profiles between affected animals and healthy controls. ten SELDI peaks significantly discriminated the scrapie group from the healthy controls. the V136R154Q171 allele is most highly associated with classical scrapie in sheep. genetic screening and breeding for resistance are widely used. the PrP genotype is, however, neither a marker for definitive disease, nor the only genetic factor influencing prion diseases. protein expression profiles can be determined by comparing intensity of peaks of similar m/z value. it is estimated that the high abundant proteins constitute 95% of the bulk mass of proteins, but they represent less than 0,1% of the total number of proteins [17] SR plots provide ranking and an objective measure of probability to guide the investigator in the selection process. it has been suggested that it is possible to classify samples based on multiple biomarker patterns, and therefore not constrained by the sensitivity and specificity of any single biomarker [16,20,25]. SELDI-TOF-MS data processing and evaluation Reproducibility of the SELDI-TOF-MS analysis was evaluated on the basis of the calculated coefficient of variation (CV) of peak intensities and m/z. the pooled CVs (CVp) were calculated and results are in the same region as reported by others. samples from scrapie group are indicated in red, and samples from control group are indicated in blue. one PCA plot for each sample point; six, eight, ten, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22 and 23 weeks of age/post infection. the score plots in Figure 3 demonstrated that healthy animals and infected animals segregated well at the clinical end-stage (23 weeks p.i.) but poorly during the asymptomatic incubation period. 8779 (7,8)*** 8796 (1,9)** (2,6)*** (4,4)*** 8813 (1,7)** (1,2)* (2,5)*** (3,2)*** 9271 (1,9)** (1,7)* (1,4)* (1,4)* (2,4)*** 9478 (2,0)*** (1,6)* (1,3)** (1,5)* 15073 (27,2)*** (16106 (19,7)*** (5,9)**. 97.8% of the variance in the group membership was not related to the disease status. the TP model was able to separate the two groups with no misclassifications. the TP model was able to separate the two groups with no misclassification.

PCA plot of distribution of the two groups using only ten peaks. the ten peaks selected from the analysis were used in a PCA plot. the data of this SELDI peak are presented in Table 5. results from data analysis for SELDI peak with m/z of 12682 Peak m/z SR Mean Intensity \u2013 Control Standard Deviation \u2013 Control Mean Intensity \u2013 Scrapie Standard Deviation \u2013 Scrapie % Wilcoxon Classification Rate Mann\u2013Whitney U test p-value 12682 1.44 0.24 0.16 12.20 7.21 95 0.00E + 00 Discussion In this study, we have evaluated the use of SELDI-MS ate methods based on latent variables are better suited, as they can handle data with more variables than observations. they reduce dimensionality of the data and reveal the underlying concept and structure in them. but due to the few peaks (variables) in datasets from the longitudinal study, we were not able to create a predictive model without increasing risk of over-fitting the regression model. the information with no correlation to group membership has then been removed. the TP score vector displays the discriminative information between the two groups on a single scale. the TP model also provides a quantitative measure of each original variable\u2019s contribution to the discrimination between groups. ten selected SELDI peaks qualified for selection by having a SR value above this threshold. the ten selected SELDI peaks were used in a PCA plot in Figure 7 to illustrate how well they separated the two groups in question along the PC 1. the increased expression in the scrapie group compared to the control group is probably related to the clinical status of the animals. cytokines can cross over into the blood and initiate a systemic APR with increased synthesis of APPs from hepatocytes, such as SAA. transthyretin is a negative APP expressed at lower levels during an APR along with the other negative APPs. the long incubation period, large variety in clinical presentation, and lack of direct link between neuropathology, PrPSc dissemination and clinical presentation create the need for new knowledge of underlying pathological processes of scrapi peaks found to be significantly under-expressed in the scrapie group compared to the control group in the LS data. the findings are of limited value, as long as the peaks are not identified as specific proteins. the difference in number of peaks detected in each group could be due to suspected variation in quality and quantity in the FT fraction. sample sets, different runs on the same or across SELDI-TOF-MS instruments have resulted in considerable variation in number of discriminating peaks. one protein species can generate about ten major peaks and many minor satellite peaks due to chemical reactions that may take place during the sample preparation and analysis. results show that it is possible to discriminate scrapie affected sheep from healthy controls. we identified one peak, or one discriminating protein, to be serum amyloid A (SAA), in the scrapie affected animals at the end stage. however, the practical application of this predictive model is restricted due to the limiting factors of SELDI-TOF-MS. the lambs were left with their mothers in confined isolated boxes under similar conditions and feeding regimes. at post mortem examination, the obex area of the brain from each animal was sampled for detection of PrPSc by WB. each sample was fractionated into six fractions (FT/F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 and F6). each FT fraction was diluted 1:10 with binding buffer before application to array. each individual LS and ES sample was applied randomly onto array. each chip was analysed with a spot protocol optimized for the low mass area (LM) between 2 and 25 kDa. spectra were collected using an average of 130 laser shots. each chip was analysed with a spot protocol optimized for the low mass area. the baseline and noise reduced spectra were normalized using the Total Ion Count (TIC) Normalization feature in the ProteinChip\u00ae Software. spectra with normalization factor above mean + 2 standard deviations were excluded from further analysis. peak clusters were detected using the following settings. ES and LS data were analysed by principal component analysis (PCA) to visually evaluate the distribution of the data irrespectively of group belonging. only ES data were further analysed using other LV methods. gel was run at 150 V for 85 minutes and de-stained overnight with ultrapure water. three protein bands in the region of 9 and 14 kDa bands on the gel were excised and subjected to tryptic digestion using OMX tube devices (OMX, Germany) three protein bands in the region of 9 and 14 kDa bands on the gel were excised. es were separated using a linear gradient from 5 to 60% B in 165 min. gradient was then run to 100% B in 10 min and held there for 30 min. electrospray voltage was set to 1 kV, and no sheath gas was used. lambs were inoculated orally with 1 gram homogenated pooled brain material from either healthy sheep or confirmed cases of classical scrapie. lambs were left with their mothers in confined isolated boxes under similar conditions and feeding regimes. serum samples were allowed to clot at room temperature for a minimum of 30 minutes and maximum 60 minutes, and then processed. serum was pipetted in aliquots and frozen at minus 80 degrees within two hours of sampling. mM HEPES pH 7.0 was used to analyse flow through (FT) fraction. each FT fraction was diluted 1:10 with binding buffer before application to array. each individual LS and ES sample was applied randomly onto array in three and five replicates. CV for ES data set was calculated for each sample based on peak information in each of the five replicates. CV for LS data set was calculated from peak information in a quality control sample that was repeatedly run with the samples. a calibration equation was created using the calibration feature in the proteinChip\u00ae software. data analysis Univariate The data were tested for difference in relative peak intensity between the two groups using the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test. the fold change in intensity was calculated as the mean peak intensity control/mean peak intensity scrapie for significantly down-regulated peaks. the number of PLS components was chosen as the one giving the first minimum in prediction error. the data were tested using the non-parametric Mann\u2013Whitney U test. protein identification One ES sample from each of the groups was prepared and processed for protein identification. three protein bands in the region of 9 and 14 kDa bands on the gel were excised and subject to tryptic digestion using OMX tube devices. the peptides were separated on the analytical column using a linear gradient from 5 to 60% B in 165 min after a 10 min delay post injection. a total run time of 256 min was used, including the washing step and 30 min re-equilibration of the columns. spectrometer was tuned daily and calibrated weekly using the calibration solution recommended by Thermo Scientific. each LTQ-Orbitrap raw file was analysed using the Proteome Discoverer 1.0. protein identifications were performed with the SEQUEST algorithm searching against even toed ungulate database available at NCBI. authors\u2019 contributions SM carried out proteomic studies, statistical data analysis, participated in protein identification and drafted the manuscript.
