{"summary": "a previously healthy 43-year-old female presented to her primary care physician with a 13-day history of recurrent nightly fevers (100\u00b0F to 101\u00b0F), nonproductive cough, and respiratory congestion. she acknowledged being bitten by mosquitoes throughout her travels and did not take malaria prophylaxis. malaria test results showed a weakly positive Plasmodium falciparum-specific antigen result (histidine-rich protein 2; T1 band), a negative pan-malaria antigen result (aldolase; T2 band) and a valid control line (C band). malaria real-time PCR was performed at an outside reference laboratory, and results were negative. the patient did test positive for Mycoplasma pneumoniae by PCR. it is known that infection by Mycoplasma pneumoniae can induce cold autoantibody formation. multiple blood bank techniques were performed to determine if a cold agglutinin was present. the gold standard for malaria diagnosis remains light microscopy (thick and thin blood films) for identification and parasite quantification (1, 2). microscopy is labor-intensive and time-consuming, and difficult to maintain personnel proficiency (2, 3). aldolase is not as sensitive as HRP-2 and may be negative for patients with low-level parasitemia. other MRDTs are available outside the united states and utilize different combinations of detection antigens. false-positive MRDT results have been reported in cases of chronic hepatitis C, toxoplasmosis, human africa trypanosomiasis, dengue, leishmaniasis, and schistosomiasis. the most common cause of false positives is attributed to rheumatoid factor (RF) (3, 4). other heterophile antibodies should be considered potential causes of false-positive results. the I antigen is located on the surfaces of red blood cells as a polyvalent, branched glycan and is derived from the linear, nonbranched i antigen (6). most children express a normal adult I+ phenotype by 2 years of age (6). the ability to detect low levels of parasitemia B. The ability to differentiate between non-falciparum Plasmodium species C. The ability to rapidly screen patients for malarial infection Which of the following is correct regarding blood film microscopy\""}
