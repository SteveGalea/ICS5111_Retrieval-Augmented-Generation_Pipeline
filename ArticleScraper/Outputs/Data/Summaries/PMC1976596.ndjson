{"summary": "URI can be caused by a variety of viruses, including rhinovirus, coronavirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and enterovirus. antibiotics are widely prescribed to treat symptoms. rapid identification of certain viruses and bacteria is necessary for proper treatment of infection. culture detected infection in 40% of patients while rhinovirus PCR detected infection in 51.5% of patients [3]. Similarly, an influenza virus surveillance study showed that 18% of samples were positive by culture and 28% were positive by TaqMan-PCR [9]. genomic assays are complementary to serological assays and especially useful for identifying an unknown specimen. URI pathogen genotyping assay was designed to identify 10 upper respiratory pathogens. 850 unique URI probes were included on the array with 12 to 13 replicates for each probe. multiple probes allow for genetic variability, especially with viral genomes. amplification/labeling reactions took approximately 3.5 hrs with a peltier thermal cycler. the reaction time was reduced to less than two hours using a peltier thermal cycler. single-strand target was produced by adjusting the melting temperature of the forward and reverse primer pools to approximately 50\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C respectively. genome DNA at 15 ng/ul was diluted to 11,000 (top panels) and 110,000 (bottom panels) and labeled either by biotin-incorporation or with biotinylated reverse primers. the average of type-specific probe group signals in picoamps is shown at the left. URI array contained probes representing two to six amplicons per organism. URI chip validation studies showed average RNA genome (A) and DNA genome (B) target signal intensity for the 10 upper respiratory pathogens studied. panels illustrate the average probe signal intensities of 12 replicates for each probe. pathogens are ADV (adenovirus 4), B.p. (Bordetella pertussis), C.p. (Chlamydia pneumoniae), CV (coronavirus), InfA (influenza A), InfB (influenza A), M.p.

URI genotyping assay could detect NA dilutions to approximately 1 to 10 genomes for 9 of 12 target categories. 4.7 11,000,000 1 89 fg M. pneumoniae 1,393,322 1 11,000,000 1 2 fg Parainfluenza Type 1 4,375,000a 512 1100,000 44 10 pg Parainfluenza Type 2 - - - - Parainfluenza Type 3 43,750,000a 40 1100,000 438 800 fg Resp.

Vertical bars indicate average genotype probe signals in picoamps and horizontal bars indicate the assay cutoff (mean of negative control probes plus three standard deviations of the mean) single-strand target was produced by adjusting the melting temperature of the forward and reverse primer pools to approximately 50\u00b0C and 65\u00b0C respectively. biotin labeling occurred during amplification by incorporation of biotin-14-dCTP/dATP in the reaction mix. biotin labeling increased assay sensitivity, but nonspecific signal increased due to binding of free biotinylated oligonucleotides to specific probes. this background could be eliminated during analysis by removing approximately 2% of the high and low signal for each genotype category prior to averaging. a specific genotype was determined based on the average signal intensity of all pathogen-specific probes. this includes 12 to 13 replicates of each probe. positive control target was included only with M. pneumoniae (A) each of the 10 target genomes was successfully identified with little or no background cross-reactivity.

Figure 7. solid-phase PCR on microarrays has also been used for genotyping assays. this approach allows for specific array probe extension and labeling for genome identification or on-chip isothermal, strand-displacement amplification. an assay combining multiplexed RT-PCR platform with a library of photocleavable Masscode tags has been used to identify multiple respiratory tract pathogens. greater assay sensitivity was obtained by using 5\u2032 biotinylated reverse primers in place of biotin-dCTP incorporation during amplification. this is especially relevant for B. pertussis with a genome GC content of 67% and RSV with a GC content of 33%. however, with this increase in sensitivity, we also observed a slightly higher background signal and also a specific pattern of binding of free biotinylated primers to some probes studies to determine assay sensitivity were difficult to analyze because of complexities in quantifying target nucleic acid in a mixture with host nucleic acid. most of stock target bacterial DNA and viral RNA concentrations used in this study were based on PFU/CFU estimates provided by ATCC. the combiMatrix array platform is able to provide very similar sensitivity and reproducibility to state of the art fluorescent detection. the array-to-array correlation for both detection techniques is very high with an average correlation coefficient of 0.94 [35] the use of multiplexed RT-PCR combined with electrochemical detection on micro-arrays has several advantages over traditional assays. the flora of a healthy individual can contain pathogenic species (e.g., S. pyogenes, S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis) they detected these organisms in a group of healthy 0 to 6 year olds at approximately the same rate as in patients with acute upper respiratory infections. they were also found in older healthy subjects (7 to 74 year olds) but at lower levels. Viral RNA was extracted from clinical samples and archived cultures with an RNAeasy kit (Qiagen, Chatsworth, CA) or from active cultures (ATCC, Manassas, VA) Genomic DNA from bacterial cultures was isolated with Qiagen DNeasy columns. positive control RNA and DNA were diluted (120) in a solution of 20 l yeast tRNA (1 mg/ml; Invitrogen) and 4.8 l BSA (10 mg/ml; New England Biolabs) in 475.2 l 10 mM Tris pH 7.4 (dilution buffer) a combination of sub-type-specific, species-specific as well as clade-specific genes were chosen for probe design based on their specificity within the organism's home-clade. the desired specificity for gene choice depended on what one wanted to discern within the topography of the organism's home-clade. five to ten genes were initially selected for each organism of interest. 25 l reaction mixes included 12.5 l of reaction buffer (Invitrogen); 2 l of 5 mM MgSO4. 0.7 l of 0.4 mM biotin-14-dCTP (Invitrogen) or biotin-11-dATP (PerkinElmer, Boston, MA) microarray hybridization and electrochemical detection Initially, microarrays were incubated for 30 min at 45\u00b0C in 50 l of a solution consisting of 5 ml of 2hybridization solution. PCR reactions from primer pools were combined and mixed 11 with 2hybridization buffer. microarray hybridization chambers were filled (50 l volume) and sealed with tape. Arrays were washed twice with 2PBST, and twice with pH4 Conductivity Buffer Substrate (BioFX) the instrument measures A at each of 12,544 electrodes on the array in 25 sec. it outputs data in picoamps to a simple text file that can be used to create a pseudoimage. case 1 and 2 are \u201cPosCntrl\u201d, and the sub-type for Cases 3 and 4 are \u201cCorona-229E\u201d and \u201cCorona-HK\u201d, respectively. the average signal for each type and sub-type was calculated, presented and graphed as a simple bar graph. DNA from bacterial cultures was isolated by resuspending the culture pellet in 475 l Tris-EDTA. DNA was extracted once with phenyl/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (25241; Sigma), twice with chloroform (Sigma) and precipitated with 3M sodium acetate and ethanol. each electrode has a distinct DNA probe above it. each electrode can be read electronically or fluorescently to determine the level of hybridization for a specific DNA sequence. a context database was then created for each organism to be typed. gene sequences were extracted from the genomic record using the GenBank annotation. regions within genomes that had the desired specificity were then selected. the first and last probes of each region were designated as amplifying primers. sequences in between were used as probes on the microarray. amplification product was initially identified by loading 3.0 l of each reaction product on 6% polyacrylamide gels (Invitrogen) for ECD assay sensitivity, 10-fold serial dilutions of NA samples (10-1 to 10-8) were made in buffer containing 40.0 g yeast tRNA (Invitrogen) and 9.6 g BSA (NEB) per 1.0 ml of dH2O. l of 20SSPE (Ambion, Austin, TX), 0.56 ml of 0.5 M EDTA (Ambion), 0.56 ml of 0.5 M EDTA (Ambion), 0.84 ml of dH2O (Ambion) microarray hybridization chambers were filled (50 l volume) and sealed with tape. data analysis for the analysis of raw intensity data from arrays. we developed a simple sorting and averaging algorithm. the organization of the data was keyed to the probe name."}
