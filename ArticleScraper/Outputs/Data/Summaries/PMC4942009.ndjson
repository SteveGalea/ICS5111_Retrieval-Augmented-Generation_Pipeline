{"summary": "1 Primary health care workers (HCWs) have found to be at higher risk for influenza than the general population. 3 Vaccines remain the cornerstone of influenza prevention in many countries worldwide 4 and are considered to be 50\u201380% effective in healthy persons aged 16\u201365 years. previous influenza vaccination has been significantly associated with current vaccine acceptance in both hospital HCWs and primary care physicians. 17, 19, 20 Factors significantly associated with lack of vaccine acceptance include no medical indication for vaccination, belief that regular medical exposure will protect against the disease, fear of vaccine side effects and lack of time or priority. the survey was piloted with four GPs and PNs from outside the study area. feedback from this process contributed to enhanced content, altered survey structure and modified wording. 583% (81/139) were located in semiurban areas, 36% (50/139) in the inner city and 57% (8/139) in rural locations. 45% (62/139) were working in practices with 4 GPs. just over 70% of respondents were vaccinated against influenza in 2007 (705%, 98/139, 95% CI: 629\u2013781) and in 2008 (727%, 101/139, 95% CI: 653\u2013801) differences in vaccination coverage between GPs and PNs for both 2007 (P = 074) & 2008 (P = 022) were nonsignificant. 698% (37/53) vaccinated in 2008 worked at a practice where the vaccine was provided free and 66% (2/3) were vaccinated despite the vaccine not being provided free for PNs at their practice. over 90% of participants believe that the influenza vaccine is safe (921%, 24/26) and effective (807%, 21/26). the yearly flu vaccine is effective Agree 72 (24) 56 (933) 128 (911) Disagree 1 (38) 1 (17) 2 (14) Unsure 4 (13) 3 (50) 7 (50) Not specified 2 (25) 0 2 (14) The influenza vaccine contains live viruses that may cause some people to get influenza Agree 19 (241) 11 (183) 30 (216) Disagree 54 (684) 46 (766) 100 (719) Unsure 5 (63) 2 (25) 7 (51) the most commonly identified barriers were lack of awareness of any recommendation for general practice staff to receive influenza vaccination (101%, 14/139, 95% CI: 51\u2013151) the most commonly identified barriers were lack of awareness of any recommendation for general practice staff to receive influenza vaccination (101%, 14/139, 95% CI: 51\u2013151) five of the twelve GPs felt paying for a vaccine was a barrier to getting vaccinated. a study of primary health care staff found much higher influenza vaccination coverage than hospital HCWs in Australia. 9 PNs in our study had higher coverage when compared to nurses in residential aged care facilities. a national survey from the Australian General Practice Network (AGPN) 23 assessed influenza vaccination coverage in GPs and PNs in the same years as our study (2007/2008) with similar response rates (34% versus 36%) the AGPN study reported slightly lower coverage (5%) across both years in both groups. the most frequently reported reason amongst Dutch GPs for not being vaccinated was having no medical indication for influenza vaccination 19 and in Israel. the most frequently reported reason amongst Dutch GPs for not being vaccinated was having no medical indication for influenza vaccination 19 and in Israel. policies demanding immunisation and operating within an effective hierarchy can lead staff members to reevaluate their beliefs about influenza immunization. pandemic influenza 2009 is also likely to increase awareness of influenza vaccination and instigate new policies and practices. a more complete and current understanding of coverage in this group is needed to build on the estimates presented here. we believe this study is a basis for future investigations and interventions to increase influenza vaccination rates in primary health care staff in Australia.
