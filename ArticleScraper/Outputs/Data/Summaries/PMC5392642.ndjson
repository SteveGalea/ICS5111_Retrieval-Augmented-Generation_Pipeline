{"summary": "CHIKV is a single-stranded RNA arthropod-borne virus belonging to the Alphavirus genus. it is transmitted to humans by mosquitoes from the Aedes genus. CHIKV rapidly expanded through the region causing outbreaks in the Antilles, Central and South America, and the united states. the CHIKV epidemic was at its peak in Puerto Rico from June 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014. all patients with laboratory-positive CHIKV infection from June 1, 2014 to September 30, 2014 were included in this study. self-reported clinical manifestations included chills, tiredness, arthralgia, joint swelling, back pain, myalgia, rash, ocular pain, abdominal pain, anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, dizziness, dyspnea, palpitations, and chest pain. self-reported comorbid conditions studied were type 2 DM, hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease, bronchial asthma, chronic obstruct hematuria was defined as > 5 red blood cells/high-powered field. proteinuria was defined as > 30 mg/dL. a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. self-reported comorbid conditions studied were type 2 DM, hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. tachycardia was defined as a heart rate > 190 beats per minute (bpm) for children younger than 2 years, > 140 bpm for children older than 2 years but younger than 10 years. logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between peripheral joint involvement with demographic and clinical variables. a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. 320 (11.9%) were recruited in the study. n (%) hospital admission 33 (19.2) shows the associations of peripheral joint involvement with demographic features and clinical manifestations of acute CHIKV infection. patients with peripheral joint involvement were more likely to be older (21.3 [19.6] versus 8.2 [10.3], P 0.001), but no significant associations were observed for age groups or gender. xia (71.8% versus 37.5%, P = 0.009), nausea (62.8% versus 18.8%, P = 0.001), headache (87.2% versus 50.0%, P = 0.001), and dizziness (48.1% versus 12.5%, P = 0.007) no significant associations were observed between groups in terms of admission to the hospital. no significant differences for type 2 DM, hypertension, cardiac disease, chronic kidney disease, bronchial asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or malignancy. mellitus 6 (3.8) 0.0 1.000 Arterial hypertension 17 (10.9) 1 (6.2) 1.000 Bronchial asthma 43 (27.6) 2 (12.5) 0.240 Chronic kidney disease 0.0 0.0 1.000 Malignancy 1 (0.6) 0.0 1.000 The multivariable analysis of variables associated with peripheral joint involvement is shown in Table 4. Clinical manifestations associated with peripheral joint involvement. patients with acute CHIKV who had peripheral joint involvement were older than those without joint symptoms. other authors have described that pediatric patients with acute CHIKV are more likely to experience nonspecific symptoms such as fever rather than the typical clinical features such as arthralgia. a cross-sectional study evaluating patients with acute CHIKV infection from two rural villages in India reported myalgia in only 25% of the population. the presence of back pain during acute CHIKV infection has been infrequently reported in the literature and classically is more associated with dengue fever. only 39% were in the severe range and 40% had maculopapular rash. rash was present in 64% of confirmed cases in a recent epidemic in Colombia. ocular pain was present in nearly half of patients with confirmed acute CHIKV infection. rash and lymphopenia may mimic the acute onset of autoimmune connective tissue diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). CHIKV may mimic other rheumatic diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), which shares some clinical and immunologic features. the presence of peripheral joint involvement was associated with other musculoskeletal symptoms such as myalgia and back pain. peripheral joint arthralgia/arthritis was not associated with female gender and chronic comorbid conditions."}
