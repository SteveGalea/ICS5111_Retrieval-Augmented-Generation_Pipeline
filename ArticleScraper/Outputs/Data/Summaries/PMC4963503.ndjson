{"summary": "TB-LAMP is a manual TB detection method based on the novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification platform (LAMP) it takes less than 2 h (60 min of hands-on time), it generates a fluorescent result that can be detected with the naked eye. 1.5 million people died from the disease in 2013. the specificity in culture-negative samples was 98.3% (938/954; 95% CI, 97.3% to 99.0%) (5). the primary study selected 11 microscopy centers with characteristic challenges regarding temperature, human resources, space, and power supply. only the three microscopy centers in India were included in the repeat trial. TB-LAMP operators were local microscopists who had no prior experience with molecular testing. TB-LAMP operators were local microscopists who had no prior experience with molecular testing. TB-LAMP operators were local microscopists who had no prior experience with molecular testing. a wide-bore disposable pipette is included in the kit to transfer 60 l of sputum to a heating tube containing extraction solution. the mixture is placed in the heating block at 90\u00b0C for 5 min to lyse and inactivate the mycobacteria. the mixture is placed in the heating block at 90\u00b0C for 5 min to lyse and inactivate the mycobacteria. two sputa per patient were randomized: one underwent direct smear examination and a TB-LAMP test while the other underwent smear microscopy only. a solid culture (Lowenstein-Jensen [LJ] medium) and a liquid culture (MGIT 960 culture; BD Microbiology Systems) were performed from the same sample as that used for the TB-LAMP. culture-positive cases identified as M. tuberculosis through antigen detection were subcategorized into smear-positive and smear-negative samples. participants that were smear negative and culture negative were considered to have clinical TB and were analyzed separately. a batched run referred to a number of samples that were run together at one time using a single positive control and a single negative control. errors were examined on this basis in order to accurately assess the impact of DNA contamination (determined by a positive negative control) data management and analysis was performed locally using a secure web-based tool developed by the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND) two of the three technicians from the primary study remained for the repeat study, but all were given the same new training. the study was reviewed by the national TB programs of participating countries. the requirement to obtain individual informed consent was waived because the standard of care was greater than routine. two small rooms (1 container-type); C & D, one small room; B, one medium size room with 2 areas; C & D, one small room Laboratory staff A, 1 lab technician, 1 lab assistant; B, 2 lab technicians; C, 2 lab technicians, 1 lab assistant A,B,C, & D, 2 lab technicians; D, 2 lab technicians Primary study population No. of participants included in the analysis 580 719 478 Mean age (range) 42 (18\u201390) 36 (18\u201389) TB-LAMP was set up in two working areas (single or adjacent rooms) the same biosafety precautions were taken as those for smear microscopy. sputum was transferred to a heating tube using a wide-bore disposable pipette. TB-LAMP and smear operators were blinded to the test results of the other. a solid culture (Lowenstein-Jensen [LJ] medium) and a liquid culture (MGIT 960 culture; BD Microbiology Systems) were performed from the same sample as that used for the TB-LAMP after N-acetyl-l-cysteine decontamination (7\u20139). culture-positive cases identified as M. tuberculosis through MPT64 antigen detection were subcategorized into smear-positive and smear-negative samples. participants that were smear negative and culture negative were considered to have clinical TB. an indeterminate TB-LAMP reading was defined as the technician being unable to judge whether the test was positive or negative. a batched run referred to a number of samples (2\u201314) that were run together at one time using a single positive control and a single negative control. errors were examined on this basis to accurately assess the impact of DNA contamination (determined by a positive negative control) in india, two of the three technicians from the primary study remained for the repeat study, but all were given the same new training. TB-LAMP performance against two routine smears, one solid culture and one liquid culture. TB-LAMP sensitivity in smear-positive, culture-positive samples was 97.2% (243/250; 95% CI, 53.5% to 70.0%); sensitivity was 62.0% (88/142; 95% CI, 53.5% to 70.0%); interoperator variability in detecting smear-negative TB cases. sensitivity of TB-LAMP was 75.0% (45/60; 95% CI, 62.1% to 85.3%) compared with 86.1% (86/332; 95% CI, 82.0% to 89.7%) in HIV-positive patients or individuals with unknown status (P = 0.59). sensitivity of TB-LAMP was 75.0% (45/60; 95% CI, 62.1% to 85.3%) at site 2, it was 97.5% (115/118; 95% CI, 92.7% to 99.5%); and at site 3, it was 92.8% (90/97; 95% CI, 85.7% to 97.0%). TB-LAMP specificity in those diagnosed with NTM was 92.5% (37/40; 95% CI, 79.6% to 98.4%), excluding clinical TB cases. 7.5% (10/133 runs) (P 0.01) of the 14 LAMP incubators under 3 years old that were shipped to 11 sites in three countries. only one had to be replaced due to a broken timer. the false positivity may have been related to adding too little of the DNA eluent from the PURE method to the reaction tube (20 to 25 l) running TB-LAMP with only the negative control, adding only 20 to 25 l eluent into the reaction tubes produced a 1% FPR. False positives only occurred at 40 and 45\u00b0C and with 25 l added (5/96, 5.2% FPR) no other false positives were detected. a revised TB-LAMP protocol specified a reaction volume of between 30 and 35 l rather than between 25 and 35 l. specificity in non-TB participants rose from 94.5% to 96.6% (515/533; 95% CI, 94.7% to 97.9%; P = 0.10, chi-square test). Specificity at site 1 was 96.4% (267/277; 95% CI, 93.5% to 98.3%); at site 2, it was 95.2% (140/147; 95% CI, 90.4% to 98.1%); and at site 3, it was 99 TB-LAMP performance against two routine smears was 97.2% (243/250; 95% CI, 94.3% to 98.9%), sample size by location India Uganda Peru All sites Overall sensitivity (C+) 88.2 (80.4\u201393.8), 102 76.6 (69.8\u201382.5), 184 94.3 (88.1\u201397.9), 106 84.4 (80.5\u201387.9), 392 S+C+ 97.3 (90.5\u201399. sensitivity was 62.0% (88/142; 95% CI, 53.5% to 70.0%); however, there was significant interoperator variability in detecting smear-negative TB cases. TB-LAMP specificity in non-TB participants was 96.6% (1,307/1,353; 95% CI, 95.5% to 99.2%) large interoperator variability was observed for the three sites in India. the specificity at site 1 was 93.8% (241/257; 95% CI, 90.1% to 96.4%); at site 2, it was 97.5% (115/118; 95% CI, 92.7% to 99.5%); and at site 3, it was 92.8% (90/97; 95% CI, 85.7% to 97.0%) a total of 29/34 indeterminate results occurred in India. the number of indeterminate results by operator varied significantly from 0.6% (1/175 runs) to 7.5% (10/133 runs) agents were stored at the supervisory sites in a fridge or cold room. short-term storage was also in a refrigerator in order to meet manufacturer's recommendations. root cause analysis was carried out to evaluate reaction conditions experienced in the field in relation to false-positive rates (FPRs) b rxn tubes were exposed to various temperatures (25, 37, 40, and 45\u00b0C) and high humidity (85% to 95%) for 15 min prior to adding 25 or 30 l eluent to the reaction tubes. false positives only occurred at 40 and 45\u00b0C and with 25 l added (5/96, 5.2% FPR). TB-LAMP sensitivity in culture-positive patients remained high at 85.7%. specificity at site 1 was 96.4% (267/277; 95% CI, 93.5% to 98.3%); at site 2, it was 95.2% (140/147; 95% CI, 90.4% to 98.1%); and at site 3, it was 99.1%. in urban and periurban health care labs, sensitivities were 96% to 100% in smear-positive TB cases and 56% to 88% in smear-negative TB cases. TB-LAMP method has been used to detect malaria, africa trypanosomiasis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza (15\u201318) the repeat study in india showed an improved specificity of 96.6% overall and a specificity of 97.6% when operating temperatures were under 30\u00b0C. alternative diagnoses were not recorded and long-term follow-up was not possible."}
