{"summary": "Methods Participants Study participants recruited from 2 hospitals designated for SARS patients in Beijing. all of them fit the world health organization case definition for probable SARS, i.e., temperature >38\u00b0C, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph and a history of exposure to a SARS patient. the nucleotide position was given with TOR2 as the reference strain (accession no. NC004718) all the original base data were processed for base calling, assembly, and editing by the SegMan II sequences analysis software. participants recruited from 2 hospitals designated for SARS patients in Beijing. all of them fit the case definition for probable SARS, i.e. temperature >38\u00b0C, cough or shortness of breath, new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiograph, and a history of exposure to a SARS patient. the nucleotide position was given with TOR2 as the reference strain. all the original base data were processed for base calling, assembly, and editing by the SegMan II sequences analysis software of DNA Star package. a total of 160 samples (81 stools and 79 sputum samples) from 62 patients with positive results by RT-PCR were included in this study. 45 samples (36 sputum samples and 9 stools) from 29 patients (17 men and 12 women, with a median age of 32 years) yielded amplicons for the 5 targeted loci. 4/8 5/22, St; 5/15, Sp GGCTC 22589 11 (M, 47) 4/8 5/5-Sp; 5/5, St GGCTC 22589 12 (M, 73) 4/9 4/28, Sp; 4/28, St TGTTT 22589, 27749 13 (M, 54) 4/9 4/28, Sp; 4/28, St GGCTC 22589, 27749 14 (F, 21) 4/11 4/ 22589, 27749 28 (F, 28) 5/7 5/22, Sp TGTTT 17620, 22589, 27749 29 (M, 22) 5/5 5/28, Sp; 5/5, Sp TGTTT 22589, 27749 29 (M, 22) 5/12 4/28, Sp; 5/5, Sp; 5/5, Sp TGTTT 22589, 27749 29 (M, 22) the first 2 patients of this cluster harbored the GGCTC motif. the remaining patients, who became ill from March 31 to May 4, showed the TGTTT motif. no intrapatient variation was observed in the 5 amplicons. previous studies have provided phylogenetic information on Beijing strains. mutations in the 5-locus motif observed in Beijing followed the same path as isolates in Guangdong Province and the worldwide epidemic. this finding can expand our understanding of SARS-CoV response to selection pressures in humans. 4 new SNVs were identified at nucleotides 17620, 22077, 22589, 27749. this study confirms evolution of SARS-CoV strains towards a TGTTT motif in positions 17564, 21721, 22222, 23823, and 27827."}
