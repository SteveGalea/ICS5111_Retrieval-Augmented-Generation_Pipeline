{"summary": "some cell polarity proteins were proposed to participate to lymphocyte migration, homing, scanning, as well as activation following antigen receptor stimulation. the cell polarity protein PALS1 is expressed in human T lymphocytes and in Jurkat T cells. the adaptor PALS1 is crucial for cellular architecture as it maintains the apico-basal polarity in epithelial cells. this unique sequence of PDZ/SH3/GK defines the so-called membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) proteins family. PALS1 mRNA and protein is expressed in human lymphocytes. knocking down of PALS1 with small interfering RNAs led to decreased proliferation of human T lymphocytes. this is reminiscent of relocation to the Golgi apparatus in cells infected with SARS cortisol. TCR-mediated stimulation only promoted a discrete redistribution of PALS1 within the cytosol of Jurkat cells. the cell polarity protein PALS1 is expressed in lymphocytes at both mRNA and protein level. we evaluated whether PALS1 might also participate to T cell activation. primary human T cells were nucleofected for three days with siRNA targeting PALS1. this led to a significant decrease in TCR-mediated induction of the activation markers CD69 and CD25 on cell surface. this was accompanied by a reduction in Carboxyfluorescein Succinimydyl Ester (CFSE) dilution. only a slight but consistent increase in TCR-mediated phosphorylation of p38 was noted. CD3-induced calcium mobilization was largely normal in PALS1-knockdown Jurkat cells. the inset immunoblot shows the level of PALS1 knockdown. we then analyzed TCR-mediated activation of NF-AT and NF-B transcription factors. NF-AT activity was significantly reduced without PALS1. BCL10 was immunoprecipitated from nonspecific (NS) and PALS1-siRNA transfected Jurkat cells. MALT1, which forms an heterodimer with BCL10, coprecipitated with BCL10 regardless of stimulation. however, PALS1 was not found bound to BCL10, but its absence diminished CARMA1 recruitment. mRNA for PATJ, CRB3, PAR6, were efficiently detected by RT-PCR. similar results were observed with PAR6 or PATJ knockdown. NF-B was normally activated in the absence of SCRIB. cells were stimulated with 1 g.ml1 anti-CD3/CD28 or with 20 ng.ml1 PMA and 300 ng.ml1 ionomycin (P/I) 24 hours later, cells were stimulated with 1 g.ml1 anti-CD3 and anti -CD28 for 0, 10, 20, and 30 min. the results strengthen the unexpected function of cell polarity proteins in lymphocyte proliferation [7], [8], [9], [10], and unveil an original role for PALS1 during TCR-mediated NF-B activation. we first performed RT-PCR analysis on resting human CD3+ T cells and Jurkat lymphocytes extracts, and detected mRNA for PALS1. TCR-mediated stimulation only promoted a discrete redistribution of PALS1 within the cytosol of Jurkat cells. polarity protein PALS1 is expressed in lymphocytes at both mRNA and protein level. the specificity of PALS1 antibodies was validated with lysates. peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) were purified on Ficoll-isopaque gradients. primary human T cells were nucleofected for three days with siRNA targeting PALS1. this led to a significant decrease in TCR-mediated induction of the activation markers CD69 and CD25 on cell surface. phosphorylation, or mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) 1/2 phosphorylation upon TCR stimulation (Figure 3A) only a slight but consistent increase in TCR-mediated phosphorylation of p38 was noted. CD3-induced calcium mobilization was largely normal in PALS1-knockdown cells. the inset immunoblot shows the level of PALS1 knockdown. data shown are representative of at least five independent experiments. we then analyzed TCR-mediated activation of NF-AT. BCL10 was immunoprecipitated from nonspecific (NS-) and PALS1-siRNA transfected Jurkat cells. MALT1, which forms an heterodimer with BCL10, coprecipitated with BCL10 regardless of stimulation. however, its absence diminished CARMA1 recruitment. PALS1 nucleates a ternary complex containing CRB3 and PATJ. mRNA for PATJ, CRB3, PAR6, were efficiently detected by RT-PCR. the same hold true for the unrelated cell polarity protein SCRIB. cells were stimulated with 1 g.ml1 anti-CD3 and anti -CD28. 24 hours later, cells were stimulated with 0.5 g.ml1 anti-CD3/CD28 or with 20 ng.ml1 PMA. PALS1 did not integrate the CBM, but its absence reduced CARMA1 binding to BCL10. in line with this, CRB3, PATJ and PAR6, which all bound PALS1 to maintain cell polarity [2], also participate to NF-B signaling upon TCR ligation in lymphocytes. antibodies to BCL10 (A-6), IkB (C-21), MALT1 (B-12), Tubulin (TU-02), PALS1 (H-250), SCRIB (C-6), PAR6 (G-9) and p65 (C-20) were purchased from Santa Cruz. Jurkat cells were transfected by electroporation with a BTX ECM 830 apparatus. PBL were purified from blood on Ficoll-isopaque gradients.
