{"summary": "enterovirus 71 (EV71) and coxsackievirus 16 (CA16) are the main causative agents of hand, foot and mouth disease. EV71 and CA16 usually infect infants and children under seven years old and present with a papulovesicular rash. a few children suffer complications such as myocarditis, pulmonary edema and aseptic meningoencephalitis. adenoviruses are a family of double-stranded DNA viruses with more than 100 identified serotypes. adenoviruses cause a wide range of illnesses, from mild respiratory infections to multiorgan disease. both enterovirus and adenovirus are transmitted via the respiratory or fecal\u2013oral routes. neutralizing antibodies to AdC7 are rare in humans. this low antibody prevalence would circumvent the negative effects of pre-existing immunity to common human serotypes of adenovirus. titers of EV71 and CA16 viruses were dissolved in phosphate buffered saline with 10% glycerol and stored at 80 \u00b0C for use in all tests in this study. the neutralization antibody tests for EV71 and CA16 were performed as previously described. twenty-four hours later, the 96-well plates were examined by fluorescence microscopy to determine a suitable virus concentration to use in the neutralization test. a titer 20 was regarded as positive for the serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies. the correlation between neutralizing antibody titers of the viruses studied was calculated using the Chi-square test. all serum samples were heat inactivated at 56 \u00b0C for 30 min prior to testing. informed consent was obtained from each study participant. the collection and use of serum samples for this study were approved by the human ethics committee. fifty microliters of diluted viruses were mixed with 50 L of two-fold serially diluted serum, at dilutions of 110\u201311280, in 96-well plates. RD cells (1104) were added to each well after incubation. seventy-two hours later, cytotoxicity was observed under a microscope. the 96-well plates were examined by fluorescence microscopy. the neutralizing antibody titer was expressed as the reciprocal of dilutions for which the proportion of green fluorescent protein-expressing cells was reduced to approximately 50% of that for the negative control. inland 152 (38.9%) Seroprevalence and distribution of neutralizing antibodies to four viruses. EV71, CA16, AdHu5 and adC7 have high seroprevalences. 61.1% were from coastal regions and 38.9% were from inland regions. only the difference in AdHu5 seroprevalence rates between coastal and inland areas reached statistical significance (P=0.001; Table 2). the box plot shows the minimum, first quartile, median, third quartile and maximum titer levels. a significant difference in neutralizing antibody titer was only observed between males and females for CA16. there were no significant differences in titer values of neutralizing antibodies between age groups for all four viruses. no significant differences were found in titer values of neutralizing antibodies between age groups. neutralizing antibody titers for different viruses were associated with those for CA16 (r=0.145, P=0.004) and AdHu5 (r=0.126, P=0.013) a significant correlation between neutralizing antibodies for other viruses was not observed. seropositivity for anti-EV71 neutralizing antibody was greater than that for anti-CA16 (P0.0001) the prevalence of neutralizing antibodies to all three of these viruses was calculated and found to be 39.4% (154/391, male/female ratio: 6985), with median neutralizing antibody titers of 80, 40 and 640. median neutralizing antibody titers to EV71, CA16, AdHu5 and AdC7 in seropositive individuals were 80, 40, 640 and 40, respectively, in coastal regions. there were no statistically significant differences in the neutralizing antibody titers for any of the four viruses between coastal and inland regions. EV71 CA16a AdHu5b AdC7 Male 82.7% (77.8%\u201387.7%) 53.5% (47.0%\u201360.0%) 69.9% (63.9%\u201375.9%) 11.1% (6.9%\u201315.2%) Female 89.7% (85.0%\u201394.4%) 66.1% (58.8%\u201373.4%) 80.0% (73.8%\u201386.2%) 12.1% (7.1%\u201317.2%) a no significant differences were found in titer values of neutralizing antibodies against EV71, CA16, AdHu5 and AdC7 of seropositive individuals among different age groups. correlation between neutralizing antibody titers for different viruses was not observed. 71 and CA16 have focused on the pediatric population. 6,9,11 Adults can also develop HFMD and neutralizing antibodies when exposed to EV71 and CA16. cell-mediated immunity also contributes to protection against EV71 and CA16. 83.3% (10 of 12 samples) of healthy adults were antibody-positive to EV71 in 2008. the seropositivity rate for EV71 was 85.3%, similar to our result. the CA16 seropositivity rate was 89.1%, which was much higher than we found. we found that AdHu5 seroprevalence rates in some areas of china ranged from 72% to 77.34% in adults. this could be due to the mild and humid climate in coastal areas. we also found a gender difference in AdHu5 seroprevalence, which was not consistent with previous reports. EV71, CA16 and AdHu5 were highly epidemic among healthy adults in china. correlation between neutralization titers for EV71, CA16 and AdHu5 confirms that enterovirus cocirculates with human adenovirus in humans."}
