{"summary": "recent large-scale randomised trial concluded that maternal immunisation can reduce serious respiratory infections in young infants. first trial to show that commonly used antiseptics could have major impacts in reducing neonatal infections and mortality in rural field-based settings in low-income countries. diagnostic systems for low-income countries can be fast, accurate, and reproducible. study showed home visits from village health workers in the first days of life could substantially reduce neonatal sepsis and neonatal mortality in low-income countries. many studies report selected populations of high-risk infants. Specimens from infants in the first 24 hours of life are also seriously under-represented, especially those from low birth-weight babies and babies born outside health facilities. neonates have a rapid and fulminant progression of septicaemic disease, nonspecific clinical signs of infection, and difficult-to-interpret laboratory results. neonates have well-functioning cationic membrane-active antimicrobial proteins and peptides (APPs) which have microbicidal properties. studies of maternal immunisation with S. agalactiae type III conjugate vaccine have also demonstrated safety and immunogenicity. barriers to maternal immunisation include liability issues for vaccine manufacturers in developed countries. intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis has been highly effective in reducing both early-onset neonatal bacterial and maternal sepsis in developed countries. halved incidence of early-onset neonatal bacterial sepsis caused by S. agalactiae from 1.7 per 1,000 live births in 1993 to 0.6 per 1,000 in 1998 [36]. clear protocols are in place in high-income countries. neonatal sepsis in studies from south africa has long been considered an important method of reducing neonatal infections. however, response varies according to the antigen. maternal antibodies interfere with a neonate's response to measles vaccine. the evaluation of recombinant APPs as adjunctive therapy for neonatal infection are still under evaluation. the impact of TLR agonists to improve defence against microorganisms are also being evaluated. no studies have examined their impact on rates of neonatal sepsis. health care providers regarding the benefits of maternal immunisation; and poor ascertainment of data from low-income countries. handwashing during delivery reduces rates of neonatal sepsis in both home and health facility settings [27]\u2013[29] reasons for lack of successful scale-up of handwashing interventions are less clear [32] studies have not shown an advantage of antibiotics or antiseptics over simply keeping the umbilical cord clean [2]. chlorhexidine cleansing has recently been shown to substantially reduce neonatal deaths in Nepal [38]. neonatal septicaemia can be very similar to those of other life-threatening diseases such as necrotising enterocolitis, hyaline membrane disease, and perinatal asphyxia. studies have provided seven danger signs which can be used to identify infants with very severe disease including neonatal sepsis. a combination of maternal risk factors and clinical signs and symptoms is currently used. peripartum proteomic analysis of the amniotic fluid is now offering the opportunity for early and accurate diagnosis of early-onset neonatal sepsis in the select population of women undergoing amniocentesis. the most commonly used commercially available test is the latex agglutination assay. these tests can only detect specific organisms such as S. agalactiae. new urinary antigen tests for pneumococcus are more encouraging but are also associated with false positives from pneumococcal carriage. real-time PCR is often used to screen for microbial load, followed by sequence-based targeting and identification of PCR amplicons (pyrosequencing) there is also a new commercially available multiplex pyrosequencing assay which can identify up to 40 different bacterial and fungal pathogens directly from whole blood. biomarkers are human blood components that increase in response to infection. the most commonly used acute phase reactant is the C-reactive protein (CRP) however, the CRP takes 12\u201324 hours to increase to measurable levels. target DNA fragments are labelled with a reporter molecule, combined into a single hybrid. this technique has been used in the identification of the specific sepsis pathogen in bacterial meningitis, acute viral respiratory tract infections, and neonatal sepsis. parenteral (intravenous or intramuscular) regimens for neonatal sepsis currently recommended by national paediatric associations are a combination of penicillin/ampicillin and gentamicin, or third-generation cephalosporins. these antibiotics are safe and retain efficacy when administered at extended intervals (e.g., twice daily or daily dosing) amoxicillin is highly efficacious against Streptococcus spp. and some gram-negative bacilli. resistance is emerging in gram-negative bacilli such as coli. new, better-absorbed oral antibiotics are also being considered. effective current measures and new approaches to prevent, diagnose, and treat neonatal sepsis are likely to be both cost-effective and feasible. intrapartum approaches such as risk-based antibiotic prophylaxis and improved hand washing during delivery are likely to be both cost-effective and feasible in these countries. a careful assessment of risks and benefits of new technologies and interventions is clearly needed. in low-income settings there are also difficulties with care-seeking for neonatal illnesses. a careful assessment of the risks and benefits of new technologies and interventions is clearly needed."}
