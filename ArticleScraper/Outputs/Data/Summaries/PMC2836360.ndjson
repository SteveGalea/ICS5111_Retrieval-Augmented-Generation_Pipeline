{"summary": "gene sequences identified a 50-base highly conserved region in 3'-terminal end of the NA gene. the GSWM showed less descriptor-variability with increased average solvent accessibility. the identified terminal segment, strongly conserved in both RNA and protein sequences, is particularly significant. a RNA double hairpin secondary structure found in a majority of the H5N1 strains also supports this observation. a pandemic occurs when a new viral strain appears, against which the human population has no immunity. it is estimated that the influenza pandemic that started with the 1918 Spanish flu killed 20 to 50 million people worldwide. the only known and effective inhibitors developed to control the spread of this virus are either the M protein (amantadine, rimantadine) or NA (oseltamivir (marketed as Tamiflu), zanamivir (marketed as Relenza) only oseltamivir and zanamivir are currently being stockpiled as precaution against any pandemic. graphic representation techniques were developed by Hamori and Ruskin [21], Gates [22], Nandy [23] and Leong and Morgenthaler [24] and have been applied to a wide variety of problems highlighting their usefulness. such techniques can be used to analyse the SARS corona virus, and, separately [27], to generate phylogenetic trees without any need for multiple alignments. in the protein algorithm we modelled a protein sequence in the abstract using a 20-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system to generate sequence descriptors. the method allows easy mathematical closure and comparison of characteristic numbers to determine the degree of relatedness of or patterns in different sequences and peptide stretches. numerical characterisation techniques have enabled quantitative estimation of sequence similarities and dissimilarities. sequences have restricted the numerical characterizations to leading eigenvalues and the like. the body region of the NA was considered for deeper analysis due to its role in docking and its large surface exposed segments along with considerable variability throughout the sequence. the body segment also holds the active site where sialidase activity takes place. of the total 471 strains of the 1350 base NAs that are more widely prevalent now, 371 strains were from avian, 96 were from human isolates and 4 from other organisms. to complement the study of H5N1 we also selected 425 complete cds of the H1N1 swine flu NA sequences deposited in the GenBank [up to 23rd July 2009] gR represents the Base Distribution index or numerical descriptor for nucleic acids. the gR represents the base distribution index or numerical descriptor for nucleic acids. gR is especially useful in comparing equal length sequences. graphical sliding window method (GSWM) was used to determine the relative degree of variability of this C-terminal 16 aa stretch. from this dataset we calculated the protein descriptor pR at each point for all 514 H5N1 protein sequences. the lower the number the lower the variability of the stretch. the GSWM identified the 16 aa segment as the optimum. a large segment will have considerable portions embedded in the protein. a large segment will have considerable variability in amino acid composition. to make quantitative comparisons between different sequences plotted in this system, we follow the method given in Raychaudhry and Nandy [41]. the weighted centre of mass of each graph is calculated by summing the co-ordinate values of each point and then a graph radius, gR, is computed. the gR represents the base distribution index or numerical descriptor for nucleic acids. RNA Secondary Structure Prediction Method To predict RNA secondary structure from the conserved 3'-terminal RNA sequence we have used the mfold RNA secondary structure prediction server. the strain used for this is A/duck/Laos/NCVD-35/2007(H5N1). aa segment variability is compared with GSWM generated amino acid segment variability (in blue) the y-axis represents both the variability and solvent accessibility. the selection of the 16 aa block of residues was dictated by the observation of the 50-base conserved nucleotide stretch. truncation of the last 22 aa leads to loss of biological function of NA. results and Discussion To determine a potentially conserved region in the H5N1 avian flu and H1N1 swine flu NA gene and protein sequences. 1N1, H3N1, H4N1, H6N1, H7N1, H9N1, and H12N1. only 25 strains of the 50-base segment had any differences in the bases. extension of the same study to samples from all nine antigenic subtypes showed considerable conserved characteristics for this protein region. LMPI-- 469 AM933234 & NN3 A/Perdix perdix/Germany/R44/06(H8N3) DNE-PGSGNWPDGSNIGFMPK-- 469 ABP52008 & NN1 A/Viet Nam/1203/2004(H5N1) in the transmembrane and stalk regions the percentage of variants, i.e. non-identical sequences, among the 514 H5 the gene sequences are all synonymous and the protein sequences are all identical with one another and to one of the dominant strains in the H5N1 sequences. the gene sequences are found to have mutated considerably compared to the earlier H1N1 and H5N1 strains but the mutations are all synonymous and the protein sequences are all identical. the first 20 aa remains constant for all computations and the last 16 residues varied depending on the sequence. the GSWM gave us 379-15 = 364 pR values for each strain. in 6 regions along the NA protein body primary sequence the variability is significantly low. a comparison between the variability results obtained from the GSWM for the 16-residue window analysis of the 514 H5N1 NAs. we constructed a 16-residue moving average of the solvent accessibility data. a reasonably good correlation, 0.49 at 0.01 significance level, can be seen between the variability of the N1 strain protein sequences and solvent accessibility within the body region. a stretch of conserved surface residues or regions of a solvent accessible protein can be of significant biological importance in terms of enabling protein-protein binding [63], allosteric regulation [64], oligomerization [65], signal peptides activity [43] etc. any molecule that targets this conserved surface stretch can interfere with the protein's normal biological activity leading to the protein's malfunction. authors' contributions All authors participated in study design, research and manuscript preparation. movie was generated by rocking the cyan coloured monomer in x-axis by 180 degrees. five of the conserved segments are seen to have small sections surface exposed."}
