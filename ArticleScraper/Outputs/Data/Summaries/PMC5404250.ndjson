{"summary": "there are 1,251 microbiological laboratories in a tiered system. system includes 31 national labs, 23 local health bureau labs, 405 hospital labs (regional level), 530 university and research institute labs (district level) and 262 private labs (district level) there are 12 national laboratories at the national laboratory system of public health in Taiwan. there are also 2 TCDC laboratories at regional campuses in central and southern Taiwan that serve as reference laboratories for disease diagnosis and pathogen characterization. the national labs attached to TCDC have been accredited since 2011. notifiable diseases are divided into 5 categories based on their degree of risks and hazards, such as case fatality rate, incidence rate, and transmission speed. the laboratory testing required to confirm each disease is conducted through 2 specimen referral and diagnosis networks regulated by law. regional and district authorized laboratories serve as diagnostic agencies for categories 2, 3 and 4 diseases. each laboratory has the authority to announce positive results without TCDC confirmation. national laboratory surveillance network of influenza viruses in Taiwan was established and coordinated by TCDC. hemagglutination inhibition assays are used to identify the predominant and variant virus strains. the antiviral susceptibility pattern of a virus is also inferred from sequences of a particular viral gene segment. from 2004 to 2016, more than 8,000 outpatient specimens per year could be stably collected and tested. the number of cases tested by regional commissioned laboratories and influenza isolates sent to TCDC are indicated on the right X and left X axes. from 2004 to 2016, more than 8,000 specimens per year were tested and more than 1,000 influenza viruses per year were isolated. circulating strain indicates its antigenic property is significantly different from that of the contemporary global vaccine strain of the same subtype. monitoring of viral drug susceptibility against neuraminidase inhibitors is also conducted routinely through the surveillance system by analyzing NA gene sequences of circulating influenza strains. virus originating in animal species, such as poultry and pigs, may cross species barriers and infect humans in a severe manner. human infections caused by zoonotic viral subtypes have occurred. the national influenza surveillance system has been used to identify novel avian-origin influenza viruses from infected human cases. all 4 H7N9 viruses are antigenically similar to the A/Anhui/1/2013 vaccine candidate strain. but they harbor markers related to enhanced polymerase activity. one virus also has markers that may confer oseltamivir resistance (the 292K in the neuraminidase protein) a total of 125 individuals with influenzalike illness or pneumonia were reported from June 10 to August 13. the virus was identified as the H6N1 subtype based on sequence analysis of its hemagglutinin and neuraminidase genes. no additional H6N1-infected cases were identified. virus has the marker related to high-affinity binding of viruses to human receptors (the 228S in the hemagglutinin protein), suggesting its better adaptation to the human population. avian-origin H7N9 virus was first detected in march 2013 in china, and it has caused 4 epidemic waves that resulted in 798 laboratory-confirmed human cases as of august 17, 2016. rase basic protein 2) and high-affinity binding of virus to human receptors. one virus also has markers that may confer oseltamivir resistance (the 292K in the neuraminidase protein) these 4 viruses were generated through various reassortment events in china. 125 individuals with influenzalike illness or pneumonia were reported; all of their respiratory specimens tested negative for H6N1. six symptomatic contacts were identified, and serological analyses of the paired serum specimens collected from those contacts also showed undetectable antibody titers (10) against the H6N1 virus. no additional H6N1-infected cases were identified. influenza surveillance system in Taiwan continuously monitors the evolution and antiviral susceptibility of influenza viruses. it provides laboratory diagnostics to maintain the sustainable detection capacity of the lab system. it also serves as a country-wide alert system for the emergence of novel influenza viruses with pandemic potential."}
