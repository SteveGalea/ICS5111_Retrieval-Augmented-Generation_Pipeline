{"summary": "clouds near Barbados are representative of clouds across the trade wind regions in observations and climate models. this finding allows observations taken at Barbados to be generalized to the broader tropics. errors in simulated clouds near Barbados are similar to errors across the tropical oceans. improvements in these clouds could reduce uncertainty in climate projections. hai He, Wing-Ho Yung, Kai Liu, and Mingjie Zhang Synaptic scaffold proteins play critical roles in organizing protein complexes essential for neuronal development and signaling. a previously unrecognized PDZ domain-mediated binding mode renders an exquisitely specific interaction between Shank and SAPAP. a modifier gene, SP110 nuclear body protein (SP110), strongly affects overall disease risk and age of onset in Pembroke Welsh Corgis at risk for DM. genetic mutations in a virulence regulator attenuate cytotoxicity but permit bacteremia and abscess formation. rsp mutants exhibited attenuated toxicity and reduced disease severity early in experimental infection. coronavirus receptor switch explained from stereochemistry of protein\u2013carbohydrate interactions and a single mutation. rsp mutants exhibited reduced disease severity early in infection. -Kdo glycosyltransferases represent a new family of -Kdo glycosyltransferases. these enzymes synthesize complex sugar-containing macromolecules that play pivotal roles in the biology of all cells. these enzymes synthesize complex sugar-containing macromolecules that play pivotal roles in the biology of all cells. the hygiene hypothesis suggests that lack of exposure to immunoregulatory microorganisms in modern urban societies is resulting in an epidemic of inflammatory disease and psychiatric disorders. stress disrupts the homeostatic relationship between the microbiota and the host, resulting in exaggerated inflammation. tissue-specific dynamin-1 deletion at the calyx of Held decreases short-term depression through a mechanism distinct from vesicle resupply Satyajit Mahapatra, Fan Fan, and Xuelin Lou Endocytosis. this effect is contrary to the expected consequence of reduced recycling and cannot be explained by the commonly known mechanisms underlying short-term depression. striatal cholinergic interneuron mediates the emergence of exaggerated beta oscillations within CBT circuits of normal mice. striatal cholinergic system is uninhibited by loss of dopamine. these results provide mechanistic insights into the therapeutic effects of anticholinergic drugs in the treatment of PD. the maize genome is 98% noncoding. the plant cell orchestrates its complex activities by restricting access to functional regions with an open chromatin configuration."}
