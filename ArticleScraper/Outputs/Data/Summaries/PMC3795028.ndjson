{"summary": "SUMO, NEDD8, ISG15, regulates diverse cellular processes. enzymatic cascade composed of activating enzymes (E1), conjugating enzymes (E2) and substrate-specific ligases (E3) control turnover of modification and play a key role in determining functional outcome. two viral interference strategies have been documented in the infected cells. adenovirus [15], severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus [16], and all members of the herpesvirus family [18], encode their own deconjugase. all the tested homologs have potent ubiquitin-specific protease activity. the EBV encoded homolog, BPLF1, has very potent ubiquitin deconjugase activity in various experimental models. overexpression of the N-terminus was associated with deubiquitination of the viral ribonucleotide reductase (RR) and the cellular DNA polymerase processivity factor PCNA. BPLF1 hydrolyzes NEDD8 conjugates in vitro and stabilizes several CRL substrates in transfected cells helix-2 of BPLF1 with the C-terminal domain (CTD) of cullins is also engaged by the CRL regulator CAND1 [29]. it remains unclear whether both the ubiquitin- and NEDD8-specific deconjugase activities operate during virus replication and how the different functions are regulated. lysates made in presence of cysteine protease inhibitors remained virtually unchanged over time. the conjugated NEDD8 decreased in parallel with increase of free NEDD8. the effect was abrogated in cells expressing the BPLF1 specific shRNA. expression of the BPLF1 specific shRNA abolished the decrease of NEDD8 conjugates and accumulation of free NEDD8. western blots of total cell lysates probed with a NEDD8 specific antibody. BPLF1 promotes selective degradation of nuclear cullins by proteasome. western blots of cell lysates from induced Akata-Bx1 were probed. one representative experiment out of three is shown. the mean SE of three experiments is shown. significant differences between fold changes in the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions are indicated. expression levels of nuclear and cytoplasmic CRL substrates were monitored over time in induced Akata-Bx1 cells. p21, p27 and IB, CRL2 substrates: VAV and HIF1, and Cdc25A substrates: CDT1 and Cdc25A. the productive cycle was induced in cells transfected with plasmids expressing myc-tagged CAND1 or the CAND1 N-terminus that compete for binding of BPLF1. low levels of Cul1, Cu4A and Cul5 and high levels of the CRL substrate CDT1 were detected upon induction of the productive cycle in cells transfected with the empty vector. the efficiency of viral DNA replication was measured by Q-PCRs in Akata-Bx1 transf RLs in infected cells are consistent with a mechanism of action based on inhibition of the binding of BPLF1 to cullins. CAND1 rescues the degradation of cullins and inhibits virus replication. one representative experiment out of three is shown. lysates of untreated and induced Akata-Bx1 were labeled with HA-Ub-VS and FLAG-NEDD8-VS functional probes that covalently bind to the catalytic cysteine. western blots of anti-HA and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were then probed with antibodies to BPLF1. both the full length and the 38 kD species were readily detected by the anti-FLAG antibody. the intensity of the 38 kD fragment was strongly decreased when the induction was carried out in the presence of caspase inhibitors. the intensity of the full length species was strongly decreased when the induction was carried out in the presence of caspase inhibitors. fluorescence micrographs of Akata-Bx1 induced in the presence of caspase-1 inhibitors stained with the affinity purified antibody to BPLF1. induction was performed in Akata-Bx1 expressing a BPLF1 specific shRNA. in line with the constitutive IL-1 production of B-lymphoma cell lines, two bands of approximately 48 kD and 20 kD were detected in western blots of untreated Akata-Bx1 probed with a caspase-1 specific antibody. the intensity of the 20 kD band increased upon induction of the productive cycle, which was prevented by addition of the caspase-1 inhibitors YVAD-CHO (Figure 7A) and VX-765 (not asterisks in the caspase-1 blot indicate residual IgG heavy chains detected by the secondary antibody. western blots of cell lysates produced as described in Figure 7A were probed with the indicated antibodies. the marmoset cell line expresses a conserved caspase-1 species detected by the cross-reactive antibody used in our experiments. inhibition of caspase-1 activity by addition of VX-765 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of viral DNA synthesis. this was parallel by a corresponding dose-dependent inhibition of the release of infectious virus assessed by the capacity of spent supernatants. a previously characterized specific shRNA [28] was transfected in Akata-Bx1. the effect was abrogated in cells expressing the BPLF1 specific shRNA. phenotype is dependent on BPLF1 expression. endogenous enzyme acts as a deneddylase during virus replication. BPLF1 selectively affects the expression and activity of nuclear CRLs Transfection of the catalytically active BPLF1 in HeLa cells promotes cullin deneddylation and their proteasomal degradation. the failure to degrade Cul2 is surprising since the BPLF1 binding site on cullins is highly conserved [29] BPLF1 promotes selective degradation of nuclear cullins by proteasome. western blots of cell lysates from induced Akata-Bx1 were probed with the indicated antibodies. cytosolic substrates of p21, p27, CDT1 and Cdc25A were not affected. expression of the BPLF1 specific shRNA rescued downregulation of Cul1, Cul3, Cul4A and Cul5. levels of IB were significantly increased in cells expressing the BPLF1 specific shRNA suggesting that the viral protein may indirectly regulate the activity of NFB. expression level of -actin is shown as loading control. as control, CRL2 was inactivated by exposing Akata-Bx1 to hypoxia. a representative experiment out of three is shown. expression of comparable amounts of the transfected proteins was confirmed in western blots probed with a Myc-specific antibody. low levels of Cul1, Cu4A and Cul5 and high levels of the CRL substrate CDT1 were detected upon induction of the productive cycle in cells transfected with the empty vector. degradation of cullins and stabilization of CDT1 were reversed in cells expressing the full length or the N-terminus of CAND1 that compete for binding of plasmids expressing the full-length, N-terminal or C-terminal domain of CAND1 were analyzed. western blots of anti-HA and anti-FLAG immunoprecipitates were then probed with the indicated antibodies. anti-HA and anti-FLAG antibodies detected two de-novo expressed enzymatic activities associated with polypeptides of >300 kD and approximately 38 kD. the 38 kD species is likely to represent an approximately 25 kD N-terminal catalytic domain cross-linked to the 11 kD probe. prediction algorithms were then used to screen the amino acid sequence of BPLF1 for the presence of cleavage sites. kD fragment was strongly decreased when the induction was carried out in the presence of caspase inhibitors. caspase-1 releases the catalytic N-terminus of BPLF1 and promotes its accumulation in the nucleus. induction was performed in Akata-Bx1 expressing a BPLF1-specific shRNA. induction was performed in induced cells expressing a BPLF1-specific shRNA. the nucleus was virtually abolished when the induction was performed. blots of untreated Akata-Bx1 probed with a caspase-1 specific antibody. the intensity of the 20 kD band increased upon induction of the productive cycle. inhibition of caspase-1 did not affect the expression of the viral transactivator BZLF1 nor the subsequent expression of the early antigen BORF2 and late antigen gp350/220. one representative experiment out of three is shown. C. Inhibition of caspase-1 hampers EBV DNA replication. the amount of viral DNA was measured by BZLF1 and EBNA1 specific Q-PCR. a dose-dependent inhibition of viral DNA synthesis was observed in the presence of 20 M VX-765. this was paralleled by a dose-dependent inhibition of the release of infectious virus assessed by the capacity of spent supernatants to induce the expression of EBNA2 in the EBV negative BJAB cell line. the recombinant enzyme has potent ubiquitin deconjugase activity in vitro. tide reductase [35], PCNA [26] and TRAF6 [27] were in all cases obtained by overexpressing the catalytic N-terminus in transfected cells. induction of the productive virus cycle was associated with strong TRAF6 deubiquitination also in the absence of BPLF1. this interpretation is supported by our findings that the NFB inhibitor IB was stabilized upon silencing of the endogenous BPLF1 in induced Akata-Bx ination promotes the exchange of substrate-adaptor modules. it is reasonable to assume that the reduced EBV DNA replication in cells overexpressing CAND1 is due to inhibition of the binding of BPLF1 of cullins. a catalytically active N-terminal fragments of the BPLF1 homolog UL36 has been detected in cells infected with HSV1. tegument protein was not detected in cells infected with HCMV [19], [20], KSHV [37] or MHV-68 [38]. the catalytic N-terminus of KSHV and MHV-68 share the cullin-binding capacity of BPLF1 and inactivate CRLs in transfected cells. it remains to be seen whether the failure to detect processing of some tegument proteins is explained by different experimental procedures the infected cell may regulate the efficiency of virus replication via caspase-1 mediated processing of BPLF1. the inflammasome triggers the self-activation of caspase-1, which in turn mediates the maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-18.
