HBoV was detected from 1,945 ARD cases by real-time fluorescent PCR. the number of positive cases and corresponding percent are shown for all the detected pathogens. HAdV-3 (61; 61.6%) and HAdV-7 (15; 15.2%), followed by HAdV-2 (12; 12.1%) and HAdV-1 (4; 4.1%). in 2010, there were 27 cases caused by HAdV-1, -2, -3, -7, and -14. in 2011, there were 41 HAdV-related ARD cases. HAdV prevalence peaked in the summer (33; 7.67%). prevalence of pediatric ARD associated with HAdVs was significantly higher in 2010 (27; 6.51%) and 2011 (41; 6.81%) than in 2012 (31; 3.34%).

KP670857, KP670858, KP670855, KP670861, KP670860, and KP670859, respectively. the genome sequence identities between both isolates and the other five isolates the genomes of both isolates OP01_2011 and IP05_2012 contained only one single T insertion in E3 non-coding region and Virus-Associated (VA) RNA II. there was only one synonymous substitution (C to T) in hexon assembly-associated protein of isolates IP02_2011. seven HAdV-7 isolates are included: one from outpatient (OP) causing mild respiratory disease named OP01_2011, three from inpatients (IP; fatal outcome) named IP01_2010, IP02_2011 and IP03_2011, two from severe cases (required intensive care and mechanical ventilation) named IP04_2011 and IP05_2012. all of these seven strains are identified as HAdV-7d. re-emergent strains DG01_2011 and 0901HZ/ShX/20091,7,15. genome types of circulating HAdV-7 isolates were identified. all the seven HAdV-7 isolates in this study have identical REA profiles with each other, different from the Gomen prototype, identified as genome type HAdV-7d. phylogenetic analysis of hexon, fiber, penton base genes, L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein gene showed no substantial differences from those found in the Japanese, Korean and US isolates. phylogenetic analysis of the HAdV-7 isolates associated with mild, severe and fatal respiratory diseases. panels A, B, C, D and E represent the phylogenetic trees of hexon, penton genes, fiber, L1 52/55 kDa DNA packaging protein. HAdV infection rate was 5.09% in pediatric inpatients and outpatients in southern china. it was 12%\u201320.1% in hospitalized children in china42,43. HAdV-positive cases were caused by HAdV-3 (61.6%), followed by HAdV-7 (15.2%), which was similar to the previous study43. the dominant pathogens co-infected with HAdV were RSV, HBoV, HPIV and HCoV. no statistically significant difference was found in terms of clinical manifestations and laboratory data between HAdV co-infection and single infection. ps and ambiguous sequences were PCR-amplified using different primers. the genome ends were determined by direct end sequencing using genomic DNA as template. Ion Torrent cannot predict the correct number of reads at long (>14-base) homopolymers long49. the genome variant 7d differs from the 1950s-era prototype strain by a lateral gene transfer. our phylogenetic analysis confirmed this recombination even in HAdV-7b, 7d, 7d2 and 7 h. this protein was expressed in both the early and late stages of infection50. the vaccine against HAdV-7 is in urgent need in both China and other population-dense countries. HAdV-7d associated with higher severity of illness has re-emerged in china and may have the potential to cause more outbreaks. nasopharyngeal swab specimens from HAdV-positive patients were inoculated into HEp-2 cells. cytopathic effect (CPE) was monitored for 10 days. the HAdVs were molecular typed by PCR amplification and sequencing of all seven hypervariable regions. bps was chosen as the reference genome. the configuration file was input after \"-c\" and \"-u\" parameters followed the same fasta file of virus sequencing data. silico and agarose gel electrophoresis restriction endonuclease analysis was used for the in silico REA analysis of the HAdV-7 whole-genome sequences. twelve restriction enzymes (BamHI, BclI, BglI, BstEII, EcoRI, HindIII, HpaI, SmaI, SalI, XbaI, and XhoI) were chosen according to the nom all the experimental protocols in this study were approved by the Medical Ethics Board of Southern Medical University. the informed consent for participation in this study were obtained from guardians of all the under-aged participants. data records of the samples, sample collection and analysis are de-identified and completely anonymous. Ion Sphere Particle beads of seven samples were loaded into Ion 318 v2 chips and individually sequenced on Ion Torrent PGM. 500 flows generating 6,063,042 reads with an average length of 182 bp. HAdV-7 strain 0901HZ/ShX/CHN/2009 (35239 bps) was chosen as the reference genome. both 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-ends including inverted terminal repeats were sequenced directly using genomic DNA as template. genome sequences were annotated based on previous annotation of HAdV-7 prototype strain (Gomen; 1952)59 and deposited into GenBank database. descriptive statistics were used for all variables. the continuous variables were summarized as medians and ranges. the categorical variables were summarized as frequencies and proportions."}
