{"summary": "protein dimers and higher oligomers in detergent micelles Vpu-WT and mutant Vpu proteins were expressed in HEK 293 cells (Fig. 1). SDS-Page analysis of the mutants Vpu-DD and Vpu-NN showed only a single band each on the SDS-PAGE at various molecular weights due to the decreased migration rate of the negative charged Vpu-DD upon denaturation. mutants of full-length Vpu (pNL4.3) from HIV-1 stained SDS-PAGE analysis of purified Vpu-WT, Vpu-DD, Vpu-56D, Vpu-52D, Vpu-NN protein elution from left to right. all fusion proteins were treated with thrombin enzyme to remove the fusion strep-tags. Vpu-NN showed the peak of the large complexes being larger than that of the smaller complexes. the third and fourth peaks correspond to thrombin and strep-His8 fusion tags. the peak ratio between the higher oligomer (referring to P1) and the dimer (referring to P2) was in favor of the dimer for all ionic strengths investigated, 50, 150 and 300 mM NaCl. the peak area of the higher oligomer is the largest at the highest ionic strength of 300 mM NaCl for the two proteins. stock solution over a period of 12 days revealed a gradual increase in the higher oligomer. a slower increase in the peak of the higher oligomer was observed for Vpu-DD. the peak of the higher oligomer was larger than that of the dimer. Vpu-NN and Vpu-DD tended to assemble very slowly reaching a final assembly ratio of a = 0.22. the fast increase in the peak of the higher oligomer should be due to the assembly of single and double phosphorylated Vpu proteins. the single phosphorylated Vpu proteins obscure the plot in as much they show \u2018mixed\u2019 assembly dynamics. two terms of the logistic growth function are combined additively to fit the experimental data of Vpu-WT. the computational model was generated by bending a helical motif of Vpu1\u201352 at the site of the EYR motif as reported previously30. two copies of the kinked Vpu1\u201352 are run in a single lipid patch in an inverted orientation for 100 ns. both of the helices remain in both of the structures. the full-length Vpu, Vpu1\u201382, is built from experimental structures from NMR spectroscopy (PDB ID: 2K7Y) of the cytoplasmic domain. Vpu1\u201380 is transformed to a coarse-grained (CG) model structure. the two serines at positions 52 and 56 are shown in red. the oligomerization ratio of Vpu-WT was due to large values of both TMD assembly (a = 0.68) and the cytoplasmic domain (a = 0.27) for Vpu-DD as well, the TMD assembly contributed the most (a = 0.50) to the overall oligomerization compared to the cytoplasmic domain (a 0.1) assembly of Vpu-WT is driven by an early assembly of the cytoplasmic domain within 0.5 s to an oligomerization ratio of 0.28. for Vpu-DD the sequence is reversed by assembly via TMDs of up to 0.50 oligomerization followed by an increasing rate of assembly due to the TMD within the first microsecond of up to 0.70. protein dimers and higher oligomers in detergent micelles Vpu-WT and mutant Vpu proteins were expressed in HEK 293 cells. SDS-Page analysis of the mutants Vpu-DD and Vpu-NN showed only a single band each on the SDS-PAGE at various molecular weights due to the decreased migration rate of the negative charged Vpu-DD upon denaturation. coomassie stained SDS-PAGE analysis of purified Vpu-WT, Vpu-DD, Vpu-56D, Vpu-52D, Vpu-NN protein elution from left to right (a) all fusion proteins were treated with thrombin enzyme to remove the fusion strep-tags. the pattern mentioned for uncleaved Vpu does not seem to be affected by thrombin treatment. Mutant Vpu-52D showed the peak of the large complexes being larger than that of the smaller complexes. the third and fourth peaks correspond to thrombin and strep-His8 fusion tags. 3.7 18.01 153.5 19.85 174.7 18.4 18.0 1.9 Oligomeric state 20.31 1.75 20.05 1.96 16.68 2.15 19.0 2.0 2.0 0.2 MW = molecular weight in kDa. the peak ratio between the higher oligomer (referring to P1) and the dimer (referring to P2) was in favor of the dimer for all ionic strengths investigated. purification from the stock solution over a period of 12 days revealed a gradual increase in the higher oligomer. a slower increase in the peak of the higher oligomer was observed for Vpu-DD. Vpu-WT exhibited a fast increase (c = 2.35 day1) first, followed by a slow increase (c = 0.31 day1) similar to the aforementioned growth rates of Vpu-NN and Vpu-DD. the slow increase should be due to the assembly of single and double phosphorylated Vpu proteins. two terms of the logistic growth function are combined additively to fit the experimental data of Vpu-WT. two copies of the kinked Vpu1\u201352 are run in a single lipid patch in an inverted orientation for 100 ns (Fig. S1) both of the helices remain in both of the structures. structures showed large fluctuations of the amino acids in the kink region. the residues define the intermediate parts between the helices. the full-length Vpu, Vpu1\u201382, is built from experimental structures from NMR spectroscopy. the oligomerization ratio of Vpu-WT was due to large values of both TMD assembly (a = 0.68) and the cytoplasmic domain (a = 0.27) for Vpu-DD as well, the TMD assembly contributed the most (a = 0.50) to the overall oligomerization compared to the cytoplasmic domain (a 0.1) as 4 Vpu-WT and 12 Vpu-DD (4WT/12DD) in the simulation box. data are fitted with a double logarithmic curve. oligomerization of the TMDs does not follow this trend due to internal reorientations within the patches. oligomerization is driven by the assembly of the TMD of Vpu independent of negative charges due to phosphorylation of the serines 52 and 56. maximum degree of oligomerization depends on the negative charges due to phosphorylation of the serines 52 and 56. the precise oligomeric state of Vpu has not yet been established. the smallest oligomeric state of Vpu and Vpu with phosphate group is a dimer. experimental evidence has not been reported in previous studies. the dimer is assembling into larger assemblies of up to 19 proteins. the computational data represent a semi-quantitative analysis of protein diffusivity. the number of Vpu was chosen to be 16 instead of the putative 19 Vpu molecules calculated from the experimental analysis. this is done due to the need to use a squared lipid patch with regularly positioned molecules of 4 Vpu to build the larger patch. the experimental part of this study verifies a \u201cdimer\u201d first step of oligomerization of Vpu as simulated in an earlier study31. in the dimer the two phosphorylation sites are the furthest apart due to electrostatic charge repulsion. the exposed negative charges of the phosphate groups have to be taken care of. channel-like regions can exist as pentameric (I) or eventually hexameric (II) assembled Vpu proteins. phosphorylation sites are necessary for the role of Vpu in the downregulation of the proteins to which it attaches. the computational models are designed to represent an estimate of the in vivo system. the proteins are embedded within a planar lipid bilayer of a single type of lipid molecule. thus, the question of whether the Vpu proteins would oligomerize in the same way and with the same dynamics when embedded in a lipid bilayer can be addressed. simulation of lipid patches with up to 16mers and 36mers is explored on a qualitative level. it is assumed that there is an equilibration of the monomeric unit of the membrane protein first due to the distance between ribosomes. the structure of the protein obtained in this state can be considered to be a \u2018molten globule\u2019 or \u2018compact intermediate\u2019, an intermediate state before the formation of a fully functional channel3. conformational changes of the proteins will allow transitions between the two states. channel-like regions can exist as pentameric (I) or eventually hexameric (II) assembled Vpu proteins. a tetrameric assembly (III) of most likely two dimers could serve as precursor state of formation of channel-like regions. phosphorylation sites in the cytoplasmic domain of Vpu play a modulating role during the initial step of assembly. besides functioning in the initiation of the downregulation of an attached host protein it also regulates the oligomeric state of Vpu. cytoplasm domain mutants of single mutated Vpu, Vpu-S52D and -S56D, as well as double mutated Vpu, Vpu-S52/56D and Vpu-S52/56 protein purification Starting from a 1-liter culture, Vpu expressing HEK 293 cells were lysed by suspending in buffer (0.05 M Tris, pH8, 0.15 M NaCl, 20% glycerol, 1 mM PMSF (phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride) and 1 ng/ml DNAase) cells were disrupted twice on ice by Microfluidizer (M-110 L) cell lysate the eluted protein was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filter (Millipore) the encoded protein contains a thrombin cleavage site (LVPRGS motif) cleavage site separating Strep-His8 tag from the C terminus of Vpu. a ratio of Thrombin (Sigma-Aldrich) was added to purified Vpu proteins at room temperature overnight. Vpu-LDAO micelles were injected into a superdex 200 10/30 column at 0.3 ml/min in buffer and then passed through the multi-angle light scattering detector and refractive index detector continuously. the data was analyzed by ASTRA software (Wyatt Technology) Residues Ile-39 to Arg-45 were merged with the helical motif of residues Ile-38 to Arg-44 of Vpu1\u201352 on the level of the C atoms to generate full-length Vpu. two of these structures (790 atoms including united atoms) were embedded into a fully hydrated lipid bilayer. lennard-Jones and short-range Coulomb interactions were cut off at 1.4 and 1 nm respectively. lennard-Jones and short-range Coulomb interactions were cut off at 1.4 and 1 nm. coarse-grained MD simulations were performed using the MARTINI force field v2.0 for water and v2.1 for protein44,45. a default elastic network was used46. the non-bonded interaction had a cut off distance of 1.2 nm. the oligomerization rate of the computational data was calculated with the concentration of trimer or higher oligomers divided by the concentration of total oligomer. the maximum value was 1 and the minimum was 0. The curves were fitted with a logarithmic growth function. S52/56D and Vpu-S52/56N were generated by quick-change site-directed mutagenesis and overlapping PCR respectively. the second serine site is still available for phosphorylation during protein expression. all constructs were verified by sequencing analysis. the supernatant was separated from insoluble material by centrifugation for 40 min at 12,000 g at 4 \u00b0C in JLA10.5 (Beckman Coulter) the resin was initially washed with high-salt buffer (0.05 M Tris, pH 8, 0.5 M NaCl, 1 mM ethylene diamine tetra acetate (EDTA), then a low-salt buffer (0.05 M Tris, pH 8, 0.15 M NaCl, 1 the fraction from the major peak was collected in 0.5 ml fractions. the whole system was pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl and 0.05% LDAO buffer. the last frame of the 100 ns MD simulation of Vpu1\u201352 was chosen to generate full-length Vpu. two of these structures (790 atoms including united atoms) were embedded in a fully hydrated lipid bilayer so that they were inverted to each other. the temperature of the protein, lipid, and water molecules was coupled to a Berendsen thermostat at 310 K with a coupling time of 0.1 ps. a semi isotropic pressure coupling was applied with a coupling time of 1.0 ps and a compressibility of 4.5e5 bar1. long-range electrostatics were calculated using the particle-mesh Ewald algorithm. the unconstrained systems were submitted to production runs of 100 ns. the last frame of the 100 ns MD simulation of Vpu1\u201380 was used to replace the serines at site 52 and 56 into aspartic acid. the simulations with mixtures of Vpu-WT and Vpu-DD were generated by replacing 4 Vpu proteins in a row by the other type of protein. the simulations were then neutralized with the respective number of Na-ions. the unrestrained systems were submitted to production runs of 10 s. cytoplasmic phosphorylated serine sites of Vpu from HIV-1 affect oligomerization."}
