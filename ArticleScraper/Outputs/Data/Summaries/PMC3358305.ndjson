{"summary": "current standard therapy is based on a combination of pegylated (PEG)-IFN- and ribavirin (RBV) and treatment response may be influenced by several virus-related factors such as HCV genotype and baseline titer of HCV RNA [2], [3]. new antiviral strategies are currently in development for HCV infection and include drugs targeting key viral enzymes. phosphoantigens (PhAgs) [14] and aminobisphosphonates [15] elicit a dual antimicrobial activity. they elicit a dual antimicrobial activity, by directly affecting microbial replication [13], [16] and by modulating other cell subsets such as DC activation and maturation [17], neutrophils recruitment and activation [18] and Th1 immune response polarization [19]. patients 24 HCV-infected patients (16 males and 8 females, mean age: 54.910.7) nave to treatment, and 35 healthy age-matched individuals (HD, 25 males and 10 females, mean age: 50.313.2) were recruited at the INMI L. Spallanzani. PBMC purified by immunomagnetic separation using anti-conjugated magnetic microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec, Germany) purity of cells fraction was >95% in all experiments, as measured by flow cytometry analysis. Specifically, V2 T-cell subsets were analyzed by using the following monoclonal antibodies. purified V9V2 T-cells from HD (n = 6) and PBMC from HD (n = 35) or HCV-patients (n = 24) were stimulated with single PhAg (IPH1101: 3 M), single IFN--2b (100 IU/ml, Schering-Plough, Belgium) or PhAg plus IFN--2b combined stimulation. ve cynomologus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were included in the study. animals were purchased from Noveprim (Ferney S.E, Mahebourg, Mauritius) and 2 from CDP (ULP Strasbourg, France) qPCR performed using Taqman 2 PCR Master mix and a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR system machine. results are expressed as normalized to -actin expression. mRNA stability was evaluated by adding 10 g/ml actinomycin D (ActD) after 18 hours of PhAg. patients 24 HCV-infected patients (16 males and 8 females, mean age: 54.910.7) nave to treatment, and 35 healthy age-matched individuals (HD, 25 males and 10 females, mean age: 50.313.2) were recruited at the INMI L. Spallanzani. phenotyping of V2 T-cells from HCV and from HD was performed by flow cytometry analysis. Specifically, purified V9V2 T-cells from HD (n = 6) and PBMC from HD (n = 35) or HCV-patients (n =. PBMC were stimulated for 18 h with single PhAg (IPH1101: 3 M), single IFN--2b (100 IU/ml, Schering-Plough, Belgium) or PhAg plus IFN--2b combined stimulation. in selected HCV and HD, the frequency of IFN--producing V9V2 T-cells was monitored. animals were anaesthetized with Ketamine 1000 ND (10 mg/kg IM) at the beginning of the study, body weights ranged from 2.2 to 5.8 kg. group 1 (4 animals) was injected subcutaneously (s.c.) with 3 mg/Kg of IPH1201. qPCR was performed using a 7900 HT Fast Real-Time PCR system machine. results are expressed as normalized to -actin expression. mRNA stability was evaluated by qRT-PCR just before Actinomycin addiction. 9V2 T-cell differentiation profile showed significant increase in V9V2 effector cells (CD45RA+CD27-) in HCV patients. CD25 and CD69 expression on V9V2 T-cells were slightly but significantly increased in HCV patients as compared to HD. Statistical analysis of CD25 and CD69 expression on V9V2 T-cells from HD (white boxes, n = 35) and HCV (grey boxes n = 24) was performed by Mann-Whitney test. it is well known that PhAgs specifically activate only V9V2 T-cell subset inducing IFN- release. flow cytometry histograms of IFN- MFI (Median Fluorescence Intensity) produced by V9V2 T-cells after PhAg stimulation are shown for one healthy donor and one HCV-infected patient. to this aim, we quantified the frequency of IFN--producing V9V2 T-cells by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. purified V9V2 T-cells were stimulated with single PhAg (3 M), single IFN- (100 IU/ml) and combined (PhAg/IFN) at the end of incubation IFN- released by V9V2 T-cells was evaluated by ELISA test. a quantitative analysis of IFN- production was performed in vitro by stimulating purified V9V2 T-cells from 6 HD by ELISA after medium (white boxes), I non-human primates (M. Fascicularis) were injected with 3 mg/Kg s.c. of PhAg (Group 1, n = 4) or with 3 mg/Kg of PhAg s.c. and 27 g/animal s.c. of PEG-IFN- (Group 2, n = 4). plasma IFN- levels were analyzed before administration, and after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 hours. IFN- production by V9V2 T-cells after PhAg stimulation did not reach the level found in HD. the relative impact of IFN- in improving individual V9V2 T-cell responsiveness was higher in HCV-infected patients than in HD. IFN--mRNA levels in purified V9V2 T-cells were evaluated by qRT-PCR. qRT-PCR performed quantitative analysis of IFN--mRNA. IFN--mRNA levels in purified V9V2 T-cells were significantly increased. IFN--mRNA persistence was studied by blocking transcription with actinomycin D after 18 hours of stimulations. results from one representative donor are shown. V9V2 T-cell differentiation profile showed a significant increase in V9V2 effector cells (CD45RA+CD27-) in HCV patients. chronic HCV infection induces an increase in activated/effectors V9V2 T-cells. Statistical analysis of CD25 and CD69 expression on V9V2 T-cells was performed by Mann-Whitney test. it is well known that PhAgs specifically activate only V9V2 T-cell subset inducing IFN- release [14]. PBMC from HCV patients showed a profound impairment in IFN- production after PhAg stimulation. flow cytometry histograms of IFN- MFI (Median Fluorescence Intensity) produced by V9V2 T-cells after PhAg stimulation are shown for one healthy donor and one HCV-infected patient. to this aim, we quantified the frequency of IFN--producing V9V2 T-cells by intracellular staining and flow cytometry. purified V9V2 T-cells were stimulated with single PhAg (3 M), single IFN- (100 IU/ml) and combined (PhAg/IFN) at the end of incubation IFN- released by V9V2 T-cells was evaluated by ELISA test. a quantitative analysis of IFN- production was performed in vitro by stimulating purified V9V2 T-cells from 6 HD by ELISA after medium (white boxes), I non-human primates (M. Fascicularis) were injected with 3 mg/Kg of PhAg s.c. or with 3 mg/Kg of PhAg s.c. and 27 g/animal s.c. of PEG-IFN- (Group 2, n = 4). plasma IFN- levels were analyzed before administration, and after 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28 hours. a single injection of PhAg resulted in an increase in a quantitative analysis of IFN- production was performed in HD (n = 35, Panel A) and in HCV (n = 24, Panel B) by ELISA after medium (white boxes), IFN- (grey boxes), PhAg (hatched boxes) and PhAg/IFN- (dark grey boxes) stimulation. IFN--mRNA levels in purified V9V2 T-cells were evaluated by qRT-PCR. the combined stimulation by PhAg and IFN- strongly enhanced IFN--mRNA expression (PhAg/IFN-: 84.4 (68.5\u2013110.1) vs. PhAg: 40.8. IFN--mRNA persistence was studied by blocking transcription with actinomycin D after 18 hours of stimulations. mRNA half-life was calculated by linear regression analysis. in our patients, no correlation was found between V9V2 T-cells dysfunction and any clinical parameter. antiviral role of activated V9V2 T-cells, mainly mediated by IFN- release, has been demonstrated in several viruses. a first demonstration that type-I IFN may be sensed by V9V2 T-cells was reported by Kunzmann et al., showing an increase of CD69 after IFN- treatment. we confirmed this observation and showed the ability of IFN- to increase V9V2 T-cell response to PhAgs stimulation in terms of IFN- production both in HD and in HCV-infected patients. a time-course study of in vivo IFN- treatment on V9V2 T-cell responsiveness to PhAg in HCV-infected patients is currently in progress. we found that IFN- acts by increasing IFN--mRNA persistence, that may result in increased IFN- translation levels. in recent years, a new attention on new direct antiviral drugs for chronic HCV infection is growing. future in vivo studies on non-human primates aimed to define the antiviral capability of the combined treatment are necessary both to assess safety and antiviral effectiveness of this combined approach."}
