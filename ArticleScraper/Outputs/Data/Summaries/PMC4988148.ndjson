{"summary": "HMPV is a member of the genus Metapneumovirus within the family paramyxoviridae. it shares structural, epidemiological, and clinical features with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), a closely related paramyxovirus. infection of airway macrophages may contribute to virus propagation during the early phase of HMPV infection. an integrin binding recognition sequence has been identified in the F proteins of all known HMPV strains (13), and the HMPV F protein is capable of interacting with multiple RGD binding integrins (13\u201316) interactions between the F protein and integrins are required to promote efficient HMPV entry and infection, at least for certain cell types (13, 14, 16). pgsA745 cells represent a mutant of the CHO cell line lacking xylosyltransferase activity. pgsA745 cells do not bind HMPV efficiently and are resistant to HMPV infection. pgsA745 cells do not bind HMPV efficiently and are resistant to HMPV infection. cells deficient in either GAGs (pgsA745) or sialic acid (Lec2) showed enhanced susceptibility to dynamin-dependent HMPV infection. pgsA745 cells were able to bind HMPV in a Ca2+-dependent manner and showed enhanced susceptibility to dynamin-dependent HMPV infection. lines were cultured in Opti-MEM (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 4 mM l-glutamine, 100 IU penicillin, 10 g of streptomycin/ml, nonessential amino acids. CAN97-83 HMPV strain was propagated in LLC-MK2 cells at 32\u00b0C in the presence of 5 g/ml tosylsulfonyl monolayers followed by immunofluorescence staining with a MAb against the HMPV N protein (MAB80121; Merck Millipore, MA, USA) titers are expressed as fluorescent-focus units (FFU) per milliliter. influenza A virus strain used in study was BJx109 (H3N2) pgsA745 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vectors containing WT or DEL DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. pgsA745 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vectors containing cytoplasmic hen egg ovalbumin (OVA) lacking the sequence for cell surface trafficking. sks by using 0.75 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were washed and resuspended in binding buffer. cells were incubated with 5 g/ml biotinylated MAA and washed. cell surface binding of lectins, MAbs, and virus was determined. cells were seeded into 8-well chamber slides (LabTek; Nunc, USA) and infected with IAV, HMPV, or RSV. slides were washed and incubated with virus in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. nucleoprotein (NP) of type A influenza viruses detected by using MAbs raised to the HMPV protein (MAB80121; Merck Millipore, MA) followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig. percentage of infected cells was determined by costaining with 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole. 96-well polyvinyl microtiter plates were coated with 1 g/ml of purified HMPV overnight and then blocked for 2 h at room temperature (RT) wells were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated at RT for 2 h with 1 g/ml of recombinant human DC-SIGN or L slides were costained with DAPI to detect cell nuclei and examined by confocal microscopy. unpaired Student's t test was used to compare two sets of data. CHO-Pro5 cells and the SIA-deficient mutant cell line Lec2 were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection. all CHO cell lines were cultured in Opti-MEM (Gibco BRL) cells were maintained in Opti-MEM (Gibco BRL) supplemented with 10% (vol/vol) fetal calf serum (FCS); 4 mM l-glutamine, 100 IU penicillin; 10 g of streptomycin/ml; nonessential amino acids. titration on LLC-MK2 monolayers followed by immunofluorescence staining with a MAb against the HMPV N protein (MAB80121; Merck Millipore, MA, USA) titers are expressed as fluorescent-focus units (FFU) per milliliter. pgsA745 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vectors containing WT or DEL DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. pgsA745 cells were transfected with pcDNA3.1/V5-His-TOPO expression vectors containing cytoplasmic hen egg ovalbumin (OVA) lacking the sequence for cell surface trafficking. t cell lines were detached from tissue culture flasks by using 0.75 mM EDTA in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were washed and resuspended in binding buffer between incubations. cells were incubated with 5 g/ml biotinylated MAA and washed. cell suspensions were pretreated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C with 200 mU/ml of broad-spectrum bacterial sialidase from Vibrio cholerae (type III; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) or with 10 U/ml of bacterial heparinase from Flavobacterium heparinum (type I; Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA) prior to use in binding assays. cells were seeded into HMPV- and RSV-infected cells were detected by using MAbs raised to the HMPV N protein (MAB80121; Merck Millipore, MA) followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-mouse Ig. a minimum of four random fields were selected for counting, assessing 200 cells for each sample. 96-well polyvinyl microtiter plates were coated with 1 g/ml of purified HMPV overnight and then blocked for 2 h at room temperature (RT) wells were washed with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) containing 0.05% (vol/vol) Tween 20 (TBST) and incubated at RT for 2 h with 1 g/ml of recombinant human DC-SIGN/L cells were cultured overnight, washed in serum-free medium, and incubated with MAb (clone 120612) for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. one chamber slide was moved to a temperature of 37\u00b0C for an additional 20 min. slides were fixed in 80% (vol/vol) acetone in water. CHO cell line lacks xylosyltransferase activity and does not express cell surface GAGs. initial studies were aimed at confirming the phenotype of parental and mutant CHO lines. CHO-Pro5 and CHO-K1 cells bound the highest levels of MAA. black histograms represent cells incubated in medium alone, white histograms represent cells incubated in medium supplemented with 100 mU/ml of bacterial sialidase. gray histograms represent cells stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM/IgG alone. anti-HS MAb binding represented as the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (1 standard error of the mean) of histograms for triplicate samples. binding to heparinase-treated cells is significantly different from binding to mock-treated cells. pgsA745 cells at 2 and 18 h were taken by confocal microscopy. the percentage of HMPV-infected cells was determined by counting the total number of DAPI+ cells versus FITC+ cells at a 100 magnification at 18 h postinfection. heparinase treatment reduced HMPV attachment significantly. binding was abrogated by pretreatment of cells with bacterial heparinase. heparinase treatment reduced binding of purified IAV by >90%. pgsA745 cells showed expression of HMPV NP at 18 h postinfection. these studies confirmed that susceptibility to HMPV infection corresponds to the detection of newly synthesized viral proteins. pgsA745 cells were all highly susceptible to infection by HMPV. expression of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN on the surface of pgsA745 CHO cells is associated with Ca2+-dependent binding of HMPV. a previous study implicated DC-SIGN-mediated recognition of HMPV in entry into DCs (26), although direct binding interactions were not investigated. cell surface expression of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN on pgsA745 cells was determined by flow cytometry using a cross-reactive MAb that detects both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. a sample that received no HMPV but was stained with all relevant antibodies was included for comparison (no virus) Flow cytometric analyses confirmed the cell surface expression of either DC-SIGN or L-SIGN on pgsA745-DC-SIGN or pgsA745-L-SIGN cells. stability transfectants expressed higher cell surface levels of L-SIGN than of DC-SIGN. DC-SIGN and L-SIGN contain C-type CRDs that bind to mannose-rich oligosaccharides in DC-SIGN and L-SIGN facilitate lectin-mediated recognition of HMPV. pgsA745 cells lack appropriate cell surface receptors for virus attachment. pgs-L-SIGN cells were more susceptible than pgs-DC-SIGN cells. K1-ctrl, pgs-DC-SIGN, and pgs-L-SIGN cells showed a marked enhancement of the expression of the HMPV N protein at between 2 and 18 h postinfection. detection at 18 h represents the synthesis of new viral N and therefore true infection by HMPV. data represent the mean percentages of infected cells (1 standard error of the mean) from a minimum of four independent fields per chamber. ns, not significantly different compared to pgs-ctrl cells (as determined by one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post hoc test) pgs-DC-SIGN (P 0.0001) and pgs-L-SIGN (P 0.0001) cells were reduced compared to untreated cells for pgs-DC-SIGN (P 0.0001) and pgs-L-SIGN (P 0.0001) cells expressing DC-SIGN/L-SIGN were resistant to RSV. heparinase incubated with mannan, a multivalent inhibitor of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN, prior to and during infection with HMPV. mannan blocked HMPV infection of both pgsA745-DC-SIGN and pgsA745-L-SIGN cells to significant levels. DC-SIGN/L-SIGN-mediated infection of pgsA745 cells by HMPV occurs via a dynamin-dependent, pH-independent route. a number of entry pathways have been implicated in HMPV infection, including direct fusion, macropinocytosis, and endocytosis. DC-SIGN/L-SIGN-mediated infection of pgsA745 cells by HMPV occurs via a dynamin-dependent, pH-independent route. monolayers of K1-ctrl, pgs-ctrl, pgs-DC-SIGN, or pgs-L-SIGN cells were treated with either a high dose (MOI = 3 FFU/cell) or a low dose ( data represent the mean percentages of infected cells (1 standard error of the mean) from a minimum of four independent fields per chamber. in panel A, * indicates that HMPV infection is significantly different from infection of untreated cells (virus only) for pgs-ctrl (P = 0.0100), pgs-DC-SIGN (P 0.0001) and pgs-L-SIGN (P 0.0001) cells. 20 mM NH4Cl completely inhibited IAV infection of K1-ctrl cells. but it had no significant effects on HMPV infection of K1-ctrl cells. similar results were obtained by using 20 M bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. CHO-K1 cells expressing either DC-SIGN or L-SIGN were infected with a low inoculum dose. expression of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN was associated with a significant enhancement of the percentage of HMPV-infected cells. IGN on CHO-K1 cells (K1-DC/L-SIGN) or CHO-K1 cells expressing an irrelevant intracellular protein (K1-ctrl cells) was determined by flow cytometry using a cross-reactive MAb that detects both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. cells were then infected with 3.7 104 FFU (MOI of 0.37 FFU/cell) of HMPV for 1 h at 37\u00b0 endocytosis-defective mutants of different CLRs were generated via mutation or deletion of the intracellular domain (32, 49, 50) therefore, we generated pgsA745 cell lines expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN with the entire N-terminal intracellular domain of DC-SIGN (33 amino acids) or L-SIGN (41 amino acids) deleted (DEL) clones of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN- pgsA745 cells were incubated with 3 105 FFU (MOI of 3 FFU/cell) of HMPV for 1 h. cells were then fixed, stained and stained for expression of the HMPV N protein. no significant differences were observed between pgsA745-ctrl cells. dynasore was added during subsequent culture to prevent further endocytosis. either cells were pretreated with 50 M dynasore for 30 min at 37\u00b0C and infected with HMPV for 60 min. cells were fixed, stained for expression of the HMPV N protein. incubation at 4\u00b0C, MAb bound to the surface of pgsA745 cells expressing WT and DEL forms of DC-SIGN. but when moved to a temperature of 37\u00b0C, the MAb was internalized into intracellular compartments in cells expressing WT DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. compared the abilities of pgsA745-DC-SIGN-WT and pgsA745-DC- SIGN were equally as susceptible to HMPV infection as cells expressing the appropriate WT receptor. the virus inoculum was added for 1 h at 37\u00b0C and then washed prior to the addition of 50 M dynasore to block subsequent endocytic virus entry. this reduction was more profound in cells expressing DEL DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. HMPV infection of cells expressing WT CLRs was reduced by shorter incubation periods prior to the addition of dynasore. however, infection of cells expressing DEL DC-SIGN/L-SIGN was largely undetectable if dynasore was added after 30 or 15 min of incubation with the virus inoculum. these experiments confirm that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN can act as bona fide entry receptors for H CHO-Pro5 and CHO-K1 express SIA due to a deficiency in galactoside 2,6-sialyltransferase. initial studies were aimed at confirming the phenotype of parental and mutant CHO cell lines. CHO-K1 and pgsA745 cells bound the highest levels of MAA. black histograms represent cells incubated in medium alone, white histograms represent cells incubated in medium supplemented with 100 mU/ml of bacterial sialidase. gray histograms represent cells stained with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgM/IgG alone. anti-HS MAb binding to heparinase-treated cells is significantly different from binding to mock-treated cells. cells were incubated in serum-free medium alone (black histograms) or pretreated with either 100 mU/ml of bacterial sialidase (white histograms) and then washed, and virus binding was determined. the percentage of HMPV-infected cells was determined by counting the total number of DAPI+ cells versus FITC+ cells at a 100 magnification at 18 h postinfection. data show mean percentages of infection (1 standard error of the mean) from a minimum of four independent fields per chamber. binding was abrogated by pretreatment of cells with bacterial heparinase but not sialidase. heparinase treatment reduced attachment significantly, whereas sialidase treatment did not significantly affect binding. in addition, we confirmed that pretreatment of CHO-K1 cells with the same concentration of sialidase reduced the binding of purified IAV by >90%. CHO-K1, CHO-Pro5, and lec2 cells were all highly susceptible to infection by HMPV, whereas pgsA745 cells were largely resistant. pretreatment of CHO-K1 cells with an equivalent concentration of sialidase reduced IAV infection from 80% to 5% when assessed by immunofluorescence at 8 to 10 h postinfection. a previous study implicated DC-SIGN-mediated recognition of HMPV in entry into DCs. ELISA plates coated with purified HMPV were incubated with 1 g/ml of recombinant DC-SIGN-Fc or L-SIGN-Fc in the presence of 10 mM Ca2+ or 5 mM EDTA. bound CLRs detected as described in Materials and Methods. pgs-DC/L-SIGN or pgsA745 cells expressing an irrelevant intracellular protein (pgs-ctrl cells) was determined by flow cytometry using a cross-reactive MAb that detects both DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. a sample that received no HMPV but was stained with all relevant antibodies was included for comparison (no virus) pgsA745-DC-SIGN or pgsA745-L-SIGN cells expressed higher cell surface levels of L-SIGN compared to control cells expressing intracellular OVA (pgsA745-ctrl) DC-SIGN and L-SIGN contain C-type CRDs that bind to mannose-rich oligosaccharides in a Ca2+-dependent manner. pgsA745 cells are more susceptible to HMPV infection than pgs-DC-SIGN cells. pgs-DC-SIGN cells are more susceptible to HMPV infection. pgs-DC-SIGN cells lack appropriate cell surface receptors for virus attachment and/or entry. pgs-L-SIGN cells showed a marked enhancement of the expression of the HMPV N protein at between 2 and 18 h postinfection. detection at 18 h represents the synthesis of new viral N. cells were infected with 3 105 FFU (MOI of 3 FFU/cell) of RSV. data represent the mean percentages of infected cells (1 standard error of the mean) from a minimum of four independent fields per chamber. values for mannan-treated cells are significantly reduced compared to those for untreated cells for pgs-DC-SIGN (P 0.0001) pgs-L-SIGN cells expressing DC-SIGN/L-SIGN bind to the G protein of RSV. stable K562, Raji, or NIH 3T3 cell lines expressing either DC-SIGN or L-SIGN did not show enhanced susceptibility to RSV infection. for infections of K1-ctrl cells, we included treatments at the standard inoculum dose (high [MOI = 3 FFU/cell]), resulting in 80% infection, as well as a lower inoculum dose (low [MOI = 0.3 FFU/cell]) lower levels of HMPV infection of K1-ctrl cells would be more sensitive to the effects of various inhibitors and treatments. DC-SIGN/L-SIGN-mediated infection of pgsA745 cells by HMPV occurs via a dynamin-dependent, pH-independent route. a number of entry pathways have been implicated in HMPV infection, including direct fusion, macropinocytosis, and endocytosis. pgs-ctrl, pgs-ctrl, pgs-DC-SIGN, or pgs-L-SIGN cells were treated with 50 M dynasore (+ dynasore) or mock treated (virus only) (A), with 20 mM NH4Cl (+ NH4Cl) or mock treated (virus only) (B), and then infected with HMPV. data represent the mean percentages of infected cells (1 standard error of the mean) from a minimum of four independent fields per chamber. panel A indicates that HMPV infection is significantly different from infection of untreated cells (virus only) for pgs-ctrl (P = 0.0100), pgs-DC-SIGN (P 0.0001) and pgs-L-SIGN (P 0.0001) cells. 20 mM NH4Cl completely inhibited IAV infection of K1-ctrl cells. but it had no significant effects on HMPV infection of K1-ctrl cells. similar results were obtained by using 20 M bafilomycin A1, an inhibitor of the vacuolar-type H+-ATPase. cell surface expression of DC-SIGN or L-SIGN increases or inhibits HMPV infection by cells expressing cell surface GAGs. this is important to determine if DC-SIGN/L-SIGN augments or inhibits HMPV infection by cells expressing cell surface GAGs. monolayers of K1-ctrl, K1-DC-SIGN, or K1-L-SIGN cells were treated with 50 M dynasore or mock treated (virus only) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. cells were then infected with 3.7 104 FFU (MOI of 0.37 FFU/cell) of HMPV for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, washed, and cultured in serum-free medium alone (virus only) pgsA745 cells expressing endocytosis-defective mutants of different CLRs were generated via mutation or deletion of the intracellular domain (32, 49, 50) therefore, we generated pgsA745 cell lines expressing DC-SIGN or L-SIGN with the entire N-terminal intracellular domain of DC-SIGN (33 amino acids) or L-SIGN (41 amino acids) deleted (DEL) clones of DC- pgsA745-ctrl cells were incubated with 3 105 FFU (MOI of 3 FFU/cell) of HMPV for 1 h, washed, cultured for an additional 17 h, and then fixed and stained for the expression of the HMPV N protein. no significant differences were observed between pgsA745 cells expressing WT or DEL DC-SIGN/L-SIGN. either cells were pretreated with 50 M dynasore for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. dynasore was included in all washing and culture steps. cells were fixed, stained for the expression of the HMPV N protein. pgsA745-DC-SIGN-WT and pgsA745-DC-SIGN-DEL cells recognized HMPV in a Ca2+-dependent manner. all lines showed significantly enhanced binding in Ca2+ compared to pgs-ctrl cells. pgsA745 cells expressing WT or endocytosis-defective DEL forms of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN were equally similar results were obtained when lower doses of the virus inoculum were used. these findings imply that following capture by either WT or DEL DC-SIGN/L-SIGN, the virus is passed to other (unknown) receptors on pgsA745 cells to promote virus entry. the addition of dynasore after 1 h resulted in a significant reduction of HMPV infection of cells expressing WT DC-SIGN/L-SI infection of cells expressing DEL DC-SIGN/L-SIGN was largely undetectable if dynasore was added after 30 or 15 min of incubation with the virus inoculum. these experiments confirm that DC-SIGN and L-SIGN can act as bona fide entry receptors for HMPV, internalizing virus rapidly to promote infection. dynasore can act as attachment factors to promote endocytic entry by other (unknown pgsA745 cells did not bind HMPV (17) and were resistant to HMPV infection (17) this study defines an experimental system in which GAG-independent interactions between HMPV and putative cell surface receptors can be investigated. these approaches allow characterization of specific receptor-mediated HMPV entry pathways that are necessary for the infectious entry of HMPV. a number of paramyxoviruses may enter and infect cells, at least in part, via endocytic pathways. dynamin-independent pgsA745 cells do not operate efficiently in pgsA745 cells. a number of paramyxoviruses may enter and infect cells via endocytic pathways. expression of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN opened up an alternative pathway of HMPV entry, resulting in enhanced levels of infection. the receptors expressed on the surface of different cell types are likely to modulate HMPV entry pathways. this concept is not limited to HMPV infection. anti-1 MAbs to block all available RGD integrins on human BEAS-2B cells. cox et al. demonstrated a 90% reduction of HMPV infectivity. but we were unable to identify appropriate MAbs to block hamster homologues of all RGD integrins. in our hands, CAN97-83 infection of Vero cells was unaffected in the presence of NH4Cl or Baf-A1 at concentrations that completely blocked IAV infection of these cells. in our hands, CAN97-83 infection of vero cells was unaffected in the presence of NH4Cl or Baf-A1 at concentrations that completely blocked IAV infection of these cells. pgsA745 cells expressing endocytosis-defective mutants of DC-SIGN/L-SIGN remained susceptible to HMPV infection in our standard infection assay. modifying our infection assays by (i) adding dynasore immediately after 60 min of incubation with the HMPV inoculum (Fig. 6E) or (ii) reducing incubation times with the HMPV inoculum to 30 or 15 low-level HMPV infection of pgsA745 cells was also inhibited in the presence of dynasore. this suggests that an alternative pathway of GAG-independent HMPV infection might also operate albeit inefficiently. however, the relevance of these receptors and pathways to other cellular targets of HMPV infection is unclear. dynamin-dependent infection of CHO-K1 cells by CAN97-83 occurred via dynamin-independent pathways. dynamin-dependent HMPV infection of BEAS-2B airway epithelial cells was also reported (15), confirming the importance of endocytosis for HMPV entry in other epithelial cell types. previous studies by Johnson et al. reported that DC-SIGN/L-SIGN binds the G glycoprotein of RSV. however, the expression of these CLRs did not result in increased susceptibility to infection. interactions between the RSV G glycoprotein and DC-SIGN/L-SIGN were implicated in intracellular signaling."}
