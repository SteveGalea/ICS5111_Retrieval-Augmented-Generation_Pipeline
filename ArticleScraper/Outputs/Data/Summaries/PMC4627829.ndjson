{"summary": "as many as 35% to 70% of patients with long bone fractures suffer from subclinical hypoxemia and remain undiagnosed. 'low-dose' corticosteroids given after the skeletal trauma are believed to have a prophylactic effect on the incidence of the fat embolism syndrome and arterial hypoxemia. ciclesonide aerosol given as prophylaxis may stabilize the lung parenchyma. it is also supposed to bear the effects of post-traumatic fat globulinemia. there are no published studies on the impact of inhaled steroids in the prophylaxis of FES. the selected patients were put into one of the two groups depending upon their random allocation number. at the earliest possible time after admission to the hospital, the patients allocated to the Group I (n1=30) were given ciclesonide (640 mcg) with a metered dose inhaler. the steroid dose was repeated once again after 24 hours. all patients were classified into six subgroups (three in the control and three in the trial group) according to their pO2 values. the analysis was done by comparing the incidence of hypoxemia and FES in both groups to determine the effects of prophylactic doses of steroids. the total length of hypoxemia was 70 hours in the ciclesonide group and 79 hours in the control group. the total length of hypoxemia was 70 hours in the ciclesonide group and 79 hours in the control group. there was no statistically significant difference in the values of partial pressure of oxygen (in mm Hg) between the two groups. corticosteroids have been shown to have a prophylactic effect on the incidence of the FES and arterial hypoxemia. they act as an anti-inflammatory agent, reducing perivascular hemorrhage and edema resulting from pulmonary parenchymal injury in response to lipid metabolites. corticosteroid use is primarily limited by the fear of systemic side effects associated with their use, such as metabolic derangements and delayed wound healing. there are still no studies regarding the role of inhaled steroids in the prophylaxis of post-traumatic hypoxia and fat embolism syndrome. a ciclesonide dose of 320 mcg is equivalent to 440 mcg fluticasone, the most potent inhaled corticosteroid. the prophylactic role of inhalational steroids, i.e. ciclesonide, in post-traumatic clinical and subclinical FES is statistically insignificant. there is no statistical significance between eventual outcomes of subclinical or clinical fat embolism syndrome between the ciclesonide prophylaxis and control groups."}
