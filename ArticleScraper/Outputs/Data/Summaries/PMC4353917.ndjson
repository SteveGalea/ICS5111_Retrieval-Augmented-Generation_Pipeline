{"summary": "an estimated 33.8 million cases of acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI) caused by RSV infection in children younger than 5 years occurred in 2005. about 66,000\u2013199,000 of these infected children died from ALRI [4] in the united states, about 125,000 hospitalizations and 2.1 million children under 5 years of age require medical attention each year. anhydride-modified proteins exhibit potent antiviral activities against human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1), herpes simplex virus (HSV) and human papillomavirus (HPV) we selected ML-modified HSA (ML-HSA) for further study because ML is much cheaper than HP. anti-RSV antibody (NCL-RSV3) was from Leica Biosystems (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd., Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) Rabbit anti-mouse HRP antibody (NCL-RSV3) was from Leica Biosystems (Leica Biosystems Newcastle Ltd., Newcastle Upon Tyne, UK) infected cells were overlaid with 2% FBS in DMEM containing 0.5% low melting point agarose and incubated at 37 \u00b0C. five days later, plaques were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining with mouse anti-RSV antibody as primary antibody. a 100-L stop solution (0.1 M NaH2PO4 and 1.5 mM Na2SO3) was added to the mixture. the absorbance at 420 nm (A420) was measured with a microplate reader. HEp-2 cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 4000 cells per well. then serially diluted proteins were added to the plated HEp-2 cells. heparin, an RSV attachment inhibitor, was included as a control. 293-F cells expressing F protein of RSV were cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (pcDNA5/FRT/TO-F) pcDNA5/FRT/TO-F and pOG44 were co-transfected into the Flp-In 293 cells with a 1:9 ratio. after 48 h of transfection, cells were split and added with 200 g/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen anti-HSA antibody (Abcam, Hong Kong) was added at 1.5 g/mL and incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human antibody (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) at 1:2500 dilution was added. the wild-type strain was passaged without drugs in parallel. at passage 15 under ML-HSA pressure, the second resistant strain (IC50 = 201 nM) was obtained. mice were housed in cages with barrier filters in certified rooms. mice were chemically immunosuppressed by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg of cyclophosphamide (Sigma) per kg of body weight. each 200-L diluted sample was assayed in duplicate sets of serial 3.17-fold dilutions in serum-free DMEM supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U of penicillin and 100 g of streptomycin per mL. each 200-L diluted sample was plated to HEp-2 cells in flat-bottom 24-well polystyrene plates (Corning, Acton, MA, USA) mouse HRP antibody was purchased from Dako (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) cells, Virus and Plasmid HEp-2 cells and Vero cells were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) antibodies were visualized by immunoperoxidase staining with mouse anti-RSV (NCL-RSV3) antibody as primary antibody (1:500 in PBS) and HRP-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse IgG as secondary antibody (1:250 dilution in PBS) 420 nm (A420) was measured with a microplate reader. the assay used to measure the percentage of arginine residue modification was performed as previously described [18,19]. -HPG (10 L, 50 mM) was added to 90 L anhydride-modified or unmodified proteins dissolved in 0.1 M sodium phosphate (pH 9.0) the absorbance at 340 nm (A340) was measured. time-of-addition and temperature shift assays were performed as previously described. ML-HSA was added to the plates at 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, or 7 h post-infection. inhibition of RSV infection was determined by plaque assay as described above. cells expressing F protein of RSV fused with GFP at its C-terminus were cloned into pcDNA5/FRT/TO vector (pcDNA5/FRT/TO-F) cells were split and added with 200 g/mL Zeocin (Invitrogen) and 100 g/mL Hydromycin B (Invitrogen) after 48 h of transfection, cells were added with 200 g/mL Zeocin (Invit horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human IgG antibody was added at 1.5 g/mL and incubated for 1 h. plates were washed between each step with 0.05% Tween 20 in PBS. interaction between ML-HSA and RSV F protein was also determined. resistant strain was obtained (IC50 = 8.39 nM) at passage 15 under ML-HSA pressure. the second resistant strain (IC50 = 201 nM) was used as the resistant strain. mice were chemically immunosuppressed by intraperitoneal injection of 100 mg of cyclophosphamide (Sigma) per kg of body weight 6 days and 1 day prior to RSV infection. four days after RSV infection, the mice were sacrificed. mice were intranasally administered with ML-HSA at different concentrations. about 30 min or 15 min later, the mice were intranasally inoculated with 2.1 105 PFU of RSV. after 4 days, the mice were sacrificed, and the viral titer in the lung homogenates was determined. anhydride-Modified Protein Inhibition of Infection by RSV A2 Strain RSV Long Strain IC50 (M) IC90 (M) IC90 (M) HP 3.142 0.458 >10 5.832 0.753 >10 HP--LG 0.62 0.011 0.227 0.029 0.153 0.011 0.422 0.021 HP-OVA 0.13 0.002 0.052 0.009 0.100 0.007 0.517 0.121 HP-HS 0.277 0.077 1.173 0.321 SU-HSA 0.011 0.005 0.049 0.021 0.014 0.005 0.110 0.070 SU-BSA 0.006 0.001 0.047 0.011 0.026 0.015 0.125 0.020 Each sample was tested in triplicate. neither anhydride-modified HSA nor unmodified HSA showed significant cytotoxicity at concentrations as high as 400 M. the IC50 values of HSA modified with HP, ML, and SU, respectively, for inhibiting infection by RSV A2 Strain (C) and Long Strain (F) each sample was tested in triplicate. each sample was tested in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice. SU-modified HSA was less efficacious against infections of RSV A2 and Long Strain than HP- and ML-modified HSA. HP-HSA had a similar anti-RSV activity than ML-HSA. the percentage of inhibition of ML-HSA was reduced to 38%. when ML-HSA was added 2 to 7 h post-infection, no significant inhibition of viral infection was seen. ML-HSA inhibits infection by targeting the early step of virus replication, which is viral entry. a cell-cell fusion assay was performed using 293 cells expressing F protein (293-F) induced with tetracycline. 293-F cells did not form syncytia without tetracycline. syncytia were observable under a microscope. ML-HSA interacted with G protein of RSV. the results showed that ML-HSA bound to G protein in a dose-dependent manner. both ML-HSA and HSA showed no significant binding to F protein. ML-HSA may Bind to the Middle Portion (Residues 145\u2013186) of the G Protein Based on Drug-Resistance Study To determine the binding site of ML-HSA in the RSV G protein, we selected a virus strain resistant to ML-HSA. the resistant strain showed high sensitivity to ML-HSA with an IC50 value of about 3.9 nM, while the resistant strain exhibited remarkable tolerance to ML-HSA the gene consists of a cytoplasmic domain (CT), a transmembrane domain (TM), two mucin-like domains and a central conserved domain (residues 164\u2013186) four cysteine residues and the two corresponding disulfide bonds in the central conserved domain are indicated. mutated amino acid residues in the G protein of ML-HSA-resistant strain are underlined. the mean viral titers in the lungs of mice treated with 50 and 75 mg/kg of ML-HSA were 2.41 and 2.25 log10 PFU per gram of lung tissue. thus, the RSV titer in the lungs of mice treated with 5, 15, 50, and 75 mg/kg of ML-HSA was reduced by 2.3%, 46.8%, 97.3% and 98.1%, respectively. the viral control cohort showed a mean of 3.79 log10 PFU per gram of lung tissue. the groups administered with ML-HSA 15 and 30 min before RSV infection had a mean of 3.11 and 2.89 log10 PFU per gram of lung tissue. the viral titers in the mice treated with ML-HSA 15 and 30 min, respectively, before RSV infection were significantly lower than those of the untreated mice. we modified four proteins, including -LG, BSA, OVA and HSA. their antiviral activities against infections of RSV A2 and Long Strain were tested. ML and SU exhibited no inhibition at the concentration up to 10 M. 0.121 HP-HSA 0.006 0.001 0.042 0.022 0.011 0.003 0.056 0.010 HP-BSA 0.005 0.001 0.025 0.010 0.016 0.004 0.099 0.011 ML >10 >10 >10 ML--LG 0.283 0.130 1.046 0.263 0.173 0.045 0.045 0.581 0.091 ML-OVA 0.024 0.011 0.011 0.0 the percentages of modified arginine and lysine residues were associated with the concentration of anhydrides used [19] to identify anhydride with optimal concentration for producing the most effective anti-RSV agent. we used SU, ML and HP at different concentrations to identify anhydride with optimal concentration. IC50 values of HSA modified with HP, ML, and SU respectively. correlation between percentages of modified arginine residues and antiviral activities of modified HSA against RSV A2 Strain (C) and Long Strain (D) each sample was tested in triplicate, and the experiment was repeated twice. to study stability of ML-HSA, we kept ML-HSA at 4, 24, and 37 \u00b0C, respectively, for 1 to 12 weeks. ML-HSA was determined highly stable (Figure 2C,D). time-of-Addition and temperature Shift Studies Suggest that ML-HSA Inhibits RSV Infection by Blocking RSV Attachment to the target cells. temperature shift assay based on report that ML-HSA could attach to cells at 4 \u00b0C, while its fusion with the target cell membrane occurs at temperatures above 18 \u00b0C [33] ML-HSA exhibited similar anti-RSV activity whether the cells were washed, or not, after it was added to the mixture of cells and virus. syncytia were observable under a microscope. ML-HSA and HSA did not inhibit the formation of syncytia. TMC353121 at 200 nM significantly blocked syncytium formation. ML-HSA and HSA showed no significant binding to F protein at the concentration up to 1,500 nM (Figure 6B). both ML-HSA and ML-HSA showed no significant binding to F protein at the concentration up to 1,000 nM (Figure 6B). ELISA performed another ELISA using anti-HSA antibody. ML-HSA has an IC50 value of about 201 nM. Neither wild-type nor resistant strains showed resistance to heparin. the viral RNA encoding G protein was sequenced and analyzed. the central conserved domain and the heparin-binding domain are shown in boxes. the mutated amino acid residues in the G protein of ML-HSA-resistant strain are underlined. a mouse model of RSV infection was used to examine the in vivo inhibitory activity of ML-HSA. ML-HSA at different concentrations was mixed with the RSV Long Strain. the infectious RSV titer in the mouse lung was expressed as the log10 PFU per gram of lung tissue. each data point represents the RSV titer for each individual animal in the respective treatment cohort. ML-HSA was administered 15 and 30 min before RSV intranasal inoculation. the infectious RSV lung titer in the mouse lung was expressed as the log10 PFU per gram of lung tissue. each data point represents the geometric mean RSV titer of the group. Xie et al. demonstrated that FB006M, an anti-HIV-1 peptide modified with a ML derivative, exhibited no significant toxic effect to animals and human [35] ML-HSA consists of 585 amino acids, including 59 lysine residues (10.1%) and 27 arginine residues (4.6%) if ML-HSA blocks virus attachment to, but not fusion with the target cells, it will still retain inhibitory activity against RSV replication. ML-HSA had similar IC50s whether or not when the unbound ML-HSA was removed before the temperature was shifted to 37 \u00b0C. however, both ML-HSA and HSA showed no significant binding to F protein at the concentration up to 1000 nM. palivizumab, an anti-RSV mAb, has been used as an immunoprophylaxis to prevent RSV infection in infants at high risk of RSV infection. ML-HSA significantly reduced the titers of RSV in the lungs of mice when it was administered intranasally before challenge with RSV. ML-HSA may be approved for over-the-counter use because of its intranasal application. ML-HSA administered 30 min prior to RSV infection yielded a significant protection. however, purified RSV with a high titer was used to infect BALB/c mice. in actual use, longer protection might be obtained with ML-HSA against RSV infection."}
