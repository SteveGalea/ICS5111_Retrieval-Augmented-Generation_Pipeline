{"summary": "specialized extraction protocols have been developed for isolation of gram-positive versus gram-negative bacterial DNA. none of the current methods have been reported to extract DNA and RNA simultaneously from both bacteria (gram-positive and -negative) and viruses, respectively, in clinical samples. bead-beating and sonication have been shown to enhance molecular detection of difficult-to-lyse bacteria6. excessive bead-beating can shear DNA and compromise detection of microbial organisms with a fragile cell wall or viral agents. bacterium haemophilus influenzae was cultured on chocolate agar. bacterium was cultured on tryptic soy/sheep\u2019s blood agar. dilutions of bacterial and viral stocks were prepared in sterile saline. input sample materials (200 l) were concentrated to a 100 l vol by centrifugation at full speed (17,500 g) in an Amicon Ultra 0.5 Centrifugal Filter Unit with Ultracel-30 membrane (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA) the concentrated sample was then transferred to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube, followed by the addition of 100 l of an enzyme cocktail. bead-beating was performed by using zirconium/yttrium bead beating tubes. dilutions were added to bead-beating tubes and shaken vigorously. the supernatant was transferred to a new 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube. dilutions were incubated at 37\u00b0C, with or without the lysozyme enzyme mixture. the remainder of the standard Qiagen protocol was followed. the developed method was used on samples spiked with influenza A at starting concentrations. tracing viral RNA and bacterial DNA were combined with an appropriate enzyme mixture in a 96-well RVS assay and Broadband bacterial low calibrant assay plate (Abbott Molecular) plates were sealed with 20 m pierceable heat-sealing foil by using an ALPS 50V microplate heat sealer. investigators adhered to the policies for protection of human subjects. Specimens had been tested by the standard department of Pathology clinical protocol to identify viral species. bacterial species were later confirmed by qPCR by using kits supplied by Primerdesign. to test viral extraction, media from viral tissue culture, inoculated with H3N2 influenza virus, were used as a control. dilutions of bacterial and viral stocks were prepared in sterile saline. a solution of 20 l proteinase K (Qiagen), 200 l buffer AL (Qiagen) and 1.5 g carrier RNA (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY, USA) was then added. samples were incubated for a further 30 min at 56\u00b0C with shaking. lysozyme addition is part of the standard Qiagen protocol suggested for gram-positive bacteria. however, it involves centrifugation of the original sample to form a pellet, removal of the supernatant, addition of the lysozyme\u2013enzyme mixture, and resuspension of the pellet. this would result in the loss of smaller viral particles that would be removed in the supernatant. the Broadband bacterial plate is designed to screen for a wide array of bacterial species over a set of 16 primer pairs. six primer sets are used to target bacteria-specific ribosomal RNA segments. the remaining 10 primer pairs are used for identification of more specific groups of bacterial species. genome copy numbers in the PLEX-ID platform are derived by comparison. an internal calibrant is present at 100 copies/well for the RVS assay and 20 copies/well for the Broadband bacterial low calibrant assay. Molecular diagnosis in clinical samples requires an extraction method that is efficient with gram-positive and -negative bacteria. initial focus of our developed extraction method was bacterial DNA. we tested numerous commercial kits, including the Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA), the prepGEM bacteria kit (ZyGEM, Hamilton, New Zealand), and the MagMAX Viral Isolation Kit (Ambion, Life Technologies) on the ability to extract nucleic acids from bacterial samples bead-beating of prepared controls with starting concentrations at 103, 102, and 101 cfu were negative for H. influenzae and S. aureus. bead-beating increased the temperature of the sample and resulted in sample loss in the interstitial spaces of the small-diameter beads. cfu PLEX-ID Quantity Value H. influenza (Gram-Negative) S. aureus (Gram-Positive) 6 101 296 52 6 102 1047 427 6 103 854 142 6 104 959 100 6 105 477 1477 6 106 411 1058 TABLE 2.

Molecular diagnosis in clinical samples requires an extraction method that is efficient with gram-positive and -negative bacteria. of all the standard protocols tested, the Qiagen DNA Mini Kit produced the most promising results. this method is based on cell lysis and DNA adsorption onto a silica membrane, followed by removal of protein and other contaminants. bead-beating of prepared controls with starting concentrations at 103, 102, and 101 cfu were negative for H. influenzae and S. aureus. bead-beating increased the temperature of the sample and resulted in sample loss in the interstitial spaces of the small-diameter beads. qPCR for H. influenzae (Gram-Negative) and S. aureus (Gram-Positive) Bacteria DNA Extracted by Use of the Modified Qiagen Method Spiked Bacterial Amount (cfu) PLEX-ID Quantity Value H. influenzae (Gram-Positive) 6 101 296 52 6 102 1047 427 6 103 854 142 6 104 959 100 6 prepared samples with starting concentration of influenza A in the range of 103 to 106 copies were extracted by use of the Ambion method or the developed protocol in the absence of carrier RNA.
