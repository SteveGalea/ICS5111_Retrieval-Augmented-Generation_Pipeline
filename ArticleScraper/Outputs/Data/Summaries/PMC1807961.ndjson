{"summary": "in eukaryotes, expression is most often mediated by transcription factors (TFs) that bind upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) and recruit the polymerase assembly. computational TFBS prediction algorithms must begin with an input set of promoters from genes hypothetically co-regulated by a shared TF. the algorithms aim to predict the binding positions and consequently the nucleotide specificity of the TF (9\u201311). oligonucleotide segments hypothesize to bind to the TF of interest. ideally, computational detection will return all sequences that bind to every TF with biologically relevant function in those upstream regions. heuristic approaches and ad hoc multiple alignment based scoring schemes are used to identify locally optimal solutions. alian neurotransmitter receptor system, the type A -aminobutyric acid receptor (GABAAR) the receptor is believed to be a pentamer made up of multiple subunits that come from at least four different subunit classes. at least 19 genes code for the various subunits that differentially combine to form numerous pharmacologically distinct GABAA receptor isoforms (29,30) METHODS Saccharomyces cerevisiae promoter selection We identified 51 genes predicted at high confidence (P 0.001) to be regulated by TF STE12 in YPD growth media. intergenic regions were truncated at 1 kb upstream of the gene's TSS. as a dust filter, we removed all putative TFBSs 6 bp long. results are clustered on promoter position, creating a per-nucleotide frequency of the long term recurrence. scores ranged from zero, with no positions aligned, to seven, the length of the STE12 PWM. we chose the alignment score corresponding to the minima of the distribution (alignment score = 4.5) as the threshold to classify predictions as TP or FP. STE12-like binding sites identified in random seed set, as well as in versions of the seed set augmented with 1\u201350 randomly chosen yeast promoters. motifScanner (39) searched GABR promoters for all vertebrate TF-binding motifs found in TRANSFAC (40). oligos are annealed by boiling sense and antisense oligonucleotides for 5 min at equal molar ratios in dH2O. transfections using DOTAP (Roche)/HEPES solutions are performed with oligonucleotides corresponding to wild-type, mutant or with DOTAP (Roche)/HEPES solution lacking oligonucleotides (MOCK) as described in (29) we applied repeated runs of Gibbs sampling to a set of 51 promoters enriched in STE12 binding as identified by whole-genome ChIP-chip experiments. we used positional clustering of 1200 results to identify the most frequently recurring positions. incorporation of additional results did not significantly alter the distribution of results. set of S.cerevisiae promoters bound by the TFs YAP1, TEC1, HAP4 and YDR026C were chosen according to ChIP-chip experiments (10) for each set, the initial promoters were analyzed using Gibbs sampling with positional clustering (solid triangles) and without (open triangles) x-axis counts over addition of DSs. we repeated our estimate of PPV of TFBS detection with the addition of 1\u201350 random yeast promoters to the original set of 51 STE12-bound promoters. positional clustering improves PPV of Gibbs sampling by >20% through the addition of up to 80% noise or 40 DSs. positional clustering is an effective mechanism to integrate results from multiple sampling procedures. positional clustering improved combined sampling by 94% compared with 25% improvement for bioprospector and motifSampler. positional clustering is more robust to noisy input than Gibbs sampling alone. hypothetical co-regulation models were evaluated by querying all 27 possible subsets of the seven GABRps. predictions were compared with instances of known binding motifs from TRANSFAC (40), and 8 of the 13 predictions (61.5%) resembled known binding sites for 10 TFs. neocortical nuclear extracts were incubated with three 32P-radiolabeled probes. oligonucleotides were added at 100-fold excess over probe. the conditions for each lane are as indicated. mRNA was harvested after 24 h, and real-time RT\u2013PCR was performed with GABA-A4 specific primers. asterisk indicates significantly different from control at 95% confidence interval. GABRA4 is regulated by brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after status epilepticus (31,53) transfection with the dsA4O produced a significant down-regulation of GABRA4 gene expression in neocortical neurons as monitored by quantitative real-time RT\u2013PCR. in total, 14 promoters upstream of six GABRs were selected for analysis. we ran the sampler BioProspector (8) 400\u2013550 times. for each promoter, we identified the maximally occurring nucleotide. we used positive predictive value, PPV = TP / ( TP + FP ) to evaluate STE12-binding site predictions. we classified predictions as true positive (TP) or false positive (FP) by comparison to the STE12-binding motif, TGAAACA. the dotted lines represent null controls, e.g. identification of STE12-like motifs by Gibbs sampling (black dotted line) and positional clustering (red dotted line) given random upstream regions. x-axis counts over the addition of DSs. each set was chosen independently from all upstream regions in the S.cerevisiae genome. nuclear extracts were prepared (42) and used for gel shift analysis after concentration. Quantification was performed on EMSAs under conditions that yield a standard curve for band intensity. oligos are annealed by boiling sense and antisense oligonucleotides for 5 min at equal molar ratios in dH2O. Gibbs sampling predictions, generated using BioProspector (8) are power-law distributed over nucleotide position. most frequently occurring nucleotides appear in as few as 10% of results. thus discarding the least frequent Gibbs sampling results may yield higher accuracy and robust identification of biologically insignificant positions. positional clustering and subsequent selection of frequently recurring nucleotides improved the PPV of the STE12 binding site by at least 37% over Gibbs sampling alone. we repeated the above prediction process for promoters predicted to bind to YAP1, TEC1, HAP4 and YDR026C. positional clustering identifies STE12-like sites in 5% of results, compared with 10\u201315% for Gibbs sampling alone. positional clustering improves PPV of Gibbs sampling by >20% through the addition of up to 80% noise. positional clustering improves accuracy through a broad range of random DSs. improvement appears to be limited and unreliable only when sampling alone correctly identifies the binding site in fewer than 20% of results. this result is consistent with our analysis of STE12-bound promoters. we chose seven mammalian GABR promoters (GABRps) whose activity is potentially altered in response to status epilepticus. orthologous promoters were included to provide more instances of binding sites in the input set than would be expected by random. EMSA (50) was performed with an excess of cold competitors to define specificity of protein binding in nuclear extracts derived from primary neocortical neurons and fibroblasts (FIBs) kept in culture. eight of the predictions show similarity to previously characterized TFBS. the conditions for each lane are as indicated. specific binding complexes are shown using asterisks (*) s were incubated with three 32P-radiolabeled probes from human A4 and D receptor subunits. cold oligonucleotides were added at 100-fold excess over probe. the conditions for each lane are as indicated. most frequently returned positions better predict TF binding sites than the maximally scoring motifs from Gibbs sampling. positional clustering allows filtering of up to 90% of spurious sampling results caused by convergence on biologically uninformative local minima. positional clustering improves robustness to the addition of DSs. computational prediction of TF binding in mammalian genomes poses just such a challenge due to increased decoy sequence in large upstream regions. a more comprehensive evaluation of the remaining GABAA receptor subunit genes may reveal additional TF-binding sites that uncover the evolutionary significance of GABR clusters in the human genome."}
