{"summary": "the new Delhi Metallo-lactamase (NDM-1) was first reported in 2009 in a patient who travelled to new Delhi and acquired a urinary tract infection caused by Klebsiella pneumonia. a recent study reported that Klebsiella pneumonia NDM-1 positive strain or Escherichia coli NDM-1 positive strain was highly resistant to all antibiotics tested except tigecycline and colistin. since August 2010, the spreading and dissemination of NDM-1 positive strain has occurred a number of experimental and theoretical studies have been devoted to understanding structural and mechanistic properties of MBLs [4], [5], [6], [7]. this novel MBL\u2014NDM-1 is likely more potent and extensive than known MBLs in inactivating -lactams antibiotics. a number of experimental and theoretical studies have also been devoted to understanding structural and mechanistic properties of MBLs. sequence alignment indicates that NDM-1 contains the identical coordinating residues (His-His-His) in the Zn2+(I)-binding site and (Asp-Cys-His) in the Zn2+(II)-binding site of the B1 subclass. the overall structure of NDM-1 shares the common characteristic folding of / sandwich. the loop1, loop2 and the insertion are colored in red. the conserve residues coordinating with zinc ions are represented as sticks. the zinc ions are represented as spheres. arginine is mutated to ala215, which enlarges the size of active site cavity. arginine is mutated to ala215, which also enlarges the size of active site cavity. arginine is mutated to ala215, which also enlarges the size of active site cavity. two reported effective antibiotics were docked into the active site of NDM-1. other 13 well-known antibiotics including carbapenem were docked into the active site of NDM-1. molecular docking data indicates that the latter 13 antibiotics fit the active site of NDM-1 quite well. colistin, the reported antibiotic susceptible for NDM-1 positive pathogens, was not able to fit the active site well probably due to its bulky volume. a proposed bis-zinc-form mechanism for the hydrolysis of cephalosporin scaffold by B1 subclass enzyme NDM-1 was compared and analysed in details. hydrophobic interactions with meropenem dramatically reduce the size of the active site cavity. meropenem mediates no other interactions with FEZ-1 except for the lactam motif. meropenem mediates no other interactions except for the lactam motif. complex models comparison between meropenem and three enzymes. meropenem is represented in green sticks. meropenem is represented in green sticks. NDM-1 hydrolyzes carbapenem antibiotics including meropenem and imipenem. it harbored moderate catalytic hydrolysis ability against cephalosporin antibiotics, including ceftazidime, cefotaxime and cefpirome. Error bars, s.d. C. compare with the wild type enzyme (pink line), the point mutants C208A (black line), D124A (red line), K211A (green line) and K211E (blue line) totally disrupt the hydrolytic activity to meropenem. mutations of loop1 (dark yellow line) hardly affect the NDM-1 hydrolytic activity. the activity of the mutants for meropenem was measured and the result is shown in Figure 8C. the decreased catalytic activity implied the mechanism should be Zn2+(II) assisted. however, the decreased catalytic activity implied the mechanism should be Zn2+(II) assisted. the newly emergent NDM-1, called \u201csuperbug\u201d, possesses more potent hydrolysis ability toward almost all antibiotics. it is made much easier by the existence of plasmids, which transmit easily from bacterium to bacterium. sequence alignment indicates that NDM-1 contains the identical coordinating residues (His-His-His-His) in the Zn2+(I)-binding site and (Asp-Cys-His) in the Zn2+(II)-binding site of the B1 subclass. the overall structure of NDM-1 shares the common characteristic folding of / sandwich. the loop1 of NDM-1 is composed of amino acids LDMPGFGAVA (residues 65\u201374) the loop1 is composed of amino acids LDMPGFGAVA (residues 65\u201374) in VIM-2 and VIM-4. in the crystal structure of apo NDM-1 in complex with hydrolyzed ampicillin (PDB ID: 3S0Z) [10], the loop1 displays a semi-closed state. it is proposed to undergo significant conformational changes during the substrate binding, in different states with or without substrate. two reported effective antibiotics were docked into the active site of NDM-1. other 13 well-known antibiotics including carbapenem were docked into the active site of NDM-1. the docking data indicates that the latter 13 antibiotics fit the active site of NDM-1 quite well. colistin, the reported antibiotic susceptible for NDM-1 positive pathogens, was not able to fit the active site well probably due to its bulky volume. one proposed bis-zinc-form mechanism for the hydrolysis of cephalosporin scaffold by B1 subclass enzyme NDM-1. the meropenem has a strong H-bond between the carboxyl of meropenem and Arg185 in the loop2. the hydrophobic interactions make the lactam ring rotate to the loop1 and elongate the distance between the lactam oxygen and Zn2+(I) to 4.3. the flapping loop is not conserved in FEZ-1, which leads to a flat active site cleft [14] hydrophobic residues such as Leu65, Val73 and Ala74 formed stable hydrophobic interactions with the dimethylamino group. it appears that the conformations of antibiotics undergo slight exchange during the catalysis. d hydrolysis of various antibiotics substrates was monitored by following the absorbance variations resulting from the opening of the -lactam ring. the chemical structures of these antibiotics are displayed in Figure 7. 50 M (red line) and 150 M (blue line) tigecycline slowed down the hydrolysis velocity of meropenem by NDM-1. the hydrolysis velocity of meropenem by NDM-1 is partially slowed down when different concentrations of tigecycline were added into the reaction system. mutations of loop1 (dark yellow line) totally disrupt the hydrolytic activity to meropenem. the activity of the mutants for meropenem was measured and the result is shown in Figure 8C. it is obvious that the mutants almost completely lose their activity in antibiotics hydrolysis. however, the decreased catalytic activity implied the mechanism should be Zn2+(II) assisted. the new emergent NDM-1, called superbug, possesses more potent hydrolysis ability toward almost all antibiotics. this is one typical example of the remarkable ability of bacteria to adapt and eventually become resistant to new antibiotics. this is one typical example of the remarkable ability of bacteria to adapt and eventually become resistant to new antibiotics. protein sequence of NDM-1 from Enterococcus faecium (HQ256747) was retrieved from NCBI protein database. the crystal structure of VIM-4 (PDB ID: 2WHG) was selected as the template [8], whose sequence identity with NDM-1 is 37%. the 3D structure of NDM-1 was then modeled by using the InsightII software. the grid-enclosing box was centered on the Zn2+(I) and defined so as to enclose residues located within 10. a scaling factor of 1.0 was set to van der Waals (VDM) radii of those receptor atoms with the partial atomic charge less than 0.25. a 5-ml overnight culture of these transformed bacteria was used to inoculate 1 liter of LB medium containing 50 g/ml kanamycin and 20 M ZnCl2. the bacteria were ruptured by sonication, and the bacteria debris was removed by centrifugation. the final proteins concentration were determined by using the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 27,880 M1 cm1. the antibiotics hydrolysation reaction were monitored by Tecan infinite 200 multimode and absorbance microplate readers. the protein sequence of NDM-1 from Enterococcus faecium was retrieved from NCBI protein database. molecular docking method Glide calculations were performed with Maestro v7.5. a restrained partial minimization was terminated when the root-mean-square deviation reached a maximum value of 0.3 in order to relieve steric clashes. mutagenesis The QuickChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) was used to introduce all the mutations into the gene of NDM-137\u2013270. protein expression and Purification The expression vectors were transformed into E.coli strain BL21(DE3). protein purity was more than 95%, estimated by sodium dodecyl sulfate gel electrophoresis. final proteins concentration were determined by using the molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm of 27,880 M1 cm1."}
