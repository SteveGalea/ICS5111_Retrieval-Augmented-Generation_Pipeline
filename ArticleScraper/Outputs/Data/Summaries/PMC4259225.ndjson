{"summary": "HCoV-HKU1 was first isolated from the nasopharyngeal aspirates of a 71-year-old man with pneumonia in Hong Kong. it is associated with both upper- and lower-respiratory-tract disease in both children and adults. patients usually present symptoms such as cough, fever, expectoration, bronchitis and pneumonia. nonstructural proteins (nsp1\u201316) assemble into a large replication\u2013transcription complex for virus replication. nonstructural protein 9, a single-stranded DNA/RNA-binding protein which exists as a dimer in physiological situations, is indispensible for virus replication. the mutant of nsp9 from HCoV-HKU1 was cloned and subjected to crystallization and preliminary crystallographic studies. the original pGEX-6p-1 construct of the nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 was verified by sequencing. it was then transformed into Escherichia coli strain BL21 (DE3). the supernatant was loaded onto a disposable column containing glutathione Sepharose 4B affinity resin (Pharmacia) for purifying GST-tagged N60K mutant of the nsp9 protein. the fusion protein was then subjected to on-column cleavage using commercial PreScission protease (Pharmacia) at 277 K for 18 h. purified mutant of the nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 was concentrated to 10 mg ml1 in the above buffer consisting of 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl pH 6.0. a crystal with typical dimensions of 0.08 0.05 0.02 mm was used for subsequent diffraction. the optimized condition consisted of 0.1 M citric acid pH 4.5, 25%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350. the crystals were cryoprotected in a solution consisting of 0.1 M citric acid pH 4.5, 25%(w/v) polyethylene glycol 3350, 20% glycerol. a = 31.9, b = 85.0, c = 95.0, = = 90 Resolution range () 50.02.60 (2.642.60) Total No. of reflections 40918 (1528) No. of unique reflections 8420 (392) Completeness (%) 98.9 (95.1) Multiplicity 4.8 (3.9) I/(I) 17.8 (3.3) R merge (%) 6.4 (30.0) R meas (%) 7.2 (34.8) R merge =, where I ranoside was added to a final concentration of 0.5 mM. the cultures were induced to express the N60K mutant of the nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 at 289 K for 16 h. centrifugation was used to harvest the cells and the bacterial pellets were resuspended in PBS. purified mutant of nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 was concentrated to 10 mg ml1 in the above buffer consisting of 20 mM MES, 150 mM NaCl pH 6.0. a crystal with typical dimensions of 0.08 0.02 mm was used for subsequent diffraction and data collection. crystallization trials were set up in 16-well crystallization plates at 291 K using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method. initial crystals of the mutant of the nsp9 protein were obtained after 24 h. KU1 collected on a MAR165 charge-coupled device detector on beamline 1W2B. rectangular box shows diffraction spots in the outer resolution shell. data-collection and processing statistics. functional mutant (N60K) of the nsp9 protein from MHV was identified by reverse-genetics methods. the mutant was shown to compensate for viral growth defects caused by a 6 nt insertion (AACAAG) into the 3\u2032-UTR of the MHV genome. the functional mutant (N60K) of the nsp9 protein from HCoV-HKU1 was expressed as a GST-tagged protein. the final protein used for crystallization trials reached greater than 95% purity. the crystals belonged to space group P212121, with unit-cell parameters a = 31.9, b = 85.0, c = 95.0. the Matthews coefficient was calculated to be 2.54 3 Da1. the solvent content was 51.6%, assuming the presence of two molecules per asymmetric unit. further structural and functional analysis will lead us to better understand how this functional mutant could rescue a deficient insertion mutant."}
