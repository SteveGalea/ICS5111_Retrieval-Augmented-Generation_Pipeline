{"summary": "membrane proteins often act as cellular receptors, transporters and various ion channels. they are involved in several crucial cellular processes, such as immune responses, nutrient uptake and nervous system signaling. new approaches also suffer from limitations, such as cell-free protein expression, which allows for fast and efficient protein expression. the plasmids pET22b(+)-hLSECtin-CRD and pGEX-6P-hLSECtin-CRD were prepared in our laboratory. the plasmids pET28b and pET28b-Tat were provided by Dr. Chenggang Zhang from our institute. plasmids pET28b-Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and pET28b-hLSECtin-CRD were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. one clone from each plate was randomly picked and used to inoculate 5 mL LB medium containing kanamycin (final concentration: 200 g/mL), followed by shaking at 37\u00b0C and 220 rpm until the logarithmic growth phase. images were gathered by Lane 1D image shooting software (Beijing SAGE Creation Science Co., Ltd, China) equal mass samples (35 g) were also fractionated by electrophoresis through 15% polyacrylamide gels. membranes were probed with mouse-derived anti-6His antibody (1:3,000 in TBST, Sigma, USA) and mouse-derived anti-GAPDH antibody (1:500 in TBST, Beijing Zhong-Shan Biotechnology, China) and incubated the bacterial subcellular structure images were captured using TEM ultramicrotomy. the bacterial cells were split by ultrasonication in detergent extraction solution. plasmids pET22b(+)-hLSECtin-CRD and pGEX-6P-hLSECtin-CRD were prepared in our laboratory. pCDNA3.1a-myc-his-hLSECtin cDNA fragments were amplified from pCDNA3.1a-myc-his-hLSECtin by PCR. prokaryotic expression vectors pET28b-Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and pET28b-hLSECtin-CRD were validated by direct sequencing. expression of Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and pET28b-hLSECtin-CRD were incubated at 37\u00b0C overnight. one clone from each plate was randomly picked and used to inoculate 5 mL LB medium containing western blotting assay Protein concentration was measured using the BCA protein assay reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., USA) equal mass (35 g) samples were fractionated by electrophoresis through 15% polyacrylamide gels. the gels were stained by Coomassie brilliant blue R-250 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., USA) and de-stained with a de-staining solution (10% acetic acid + 30% ethanol + the bacterial cells were immobilized with 300 L 2% Osmium tetroxide immobilization liquid for 2 days and sectioned using TEM ultramicrotomy. all experiments were performed in triplicate. fractions were precipitated with 40 g of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and 0.5 mL 30% trichloroacetic acid for 30 min on ice. pellets were washed twice with equal volumes of ethanol ether and dried at room temperature for 10 min. equal volume samples were then prepared and fractionated by 15% SDS-PAGE and Western blot. the hLSECtin-CRD (360bp) cDNA fragments were cloned into the prokaryotic expression vectors pET28b-Tat, pET28b, pET22b (+) and pGEX-6P-1. the peptide promotes the soluble expression of the membrane protein hLSECtin-CRD in E. coli. the Tat-tagged and Tat-free vectors (pET28b-Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and pET28b-hLSECtin-CRD) were constructed. equal mass expressed proteins were detected by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. a subsequent histogram analysis showed a significant difference between Tat-tagged proteins (Tat-hLSECtin-CRD) and Tat-free proteins (hLSECtin-CRD) the Tat tag protein mainly expressed in the total protein and the supernatant. it indicated that Tat tag promoted soluble expression of heterologous proteins in E. coli and did not change the yield of heterologous proteins. arrowheads indicate different aggregation level of Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and Tat-free hLSECtin-CRD. hLSECtin-CRD possesses mannose-binding activity. a portion of Tat-hLSECtin-CRD proteins had bound on mannose-agarose column. prokaryotic expression vector pET28b-Tat-hLSECtin-CRD was constructed and validated by direct sequencing. the hLSECtin-CRD (360bp) cDNA fragments were cloned into the prokaryotic expression vector pET28b-Tat, pET28b, pET22b (+) and pGEX-6P-1 to construct the prokaryotic expression vectors. the Tat peptide promotes the soluble expression of the membrane protein hLSECtin-CRD in E. coli. pET22b(+)-hLSECtin-CRD, pGEX-6P-1-hLSECtin-CRD. b, c: SDS-PAGE and corresponding Western blot analysis of the total protein, the supernatant fraction and the sediment fraction respectively. TEM ultramicrotomy was used to elucidate the subcellular structure changes of bacterial cells after overexpressed Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and Tat-free hLSECtin-CRD proteins. the results showed that the cytosol in bacterial cells which overexpressed Tat-hLSECtin-CRD proteins was denser than control cells. arrowheads indicate different aggregation level of Tat-hLSECtin-CRD and Tat-free hLSECtin-CRD. the red arrows indicate the denser region of Tat-hLSECtin-CRD in cytosol. hLSECtin-CRD possesses mannose-binding activity. eukaryotic membrane proteins were expressed in eukaryotic systems by recombinant techniques but with much lower yields. eukaryotic membrane proteins were expressed in eukaryotic systems by recombinant techniques but with much lower yields [10], but only for some prokaryotic proteins, since eukaryotic membrane proteins aggregated into inclusion bodies due to lack of appropriate posttranslational modification mechanisms. hLSECtin-CRD gene is located on chromosome 19p13.3 and expressed in human peripheral blood and thymic dendritic cells, sinusoidal endothelial cells, and liver Kupffer cells [18,45]. the biological activity of hLSECtin has been well documented, but little structural information exists due to the lack of abundant soluble protein for crystallization. the Tat tag technique could be applied to a variety of membrane proteins that are difficult to express in further structural studies."}
