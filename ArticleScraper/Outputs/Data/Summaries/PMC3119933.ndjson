{"summary": "porcine encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) virus-like particles (VLPs) were generated using a baculovirus expression system and tested for immunogenicity and protective efficacy in vivo. swine increased neutralizing antibody titers were observed following twice immunization with 2.0 g crude protein containing VLPs. recombinant baculovirus Bac-P12A3C contains the structural protein P1, the nonstructural protein 2A and the protease 3C of porcine EMCV K3 (wild strain) the recombinant baculovirus Bac-P12A3C induces formation of VLPs that mimic the antigenic structure of authentic porcine EMCV particles. the recombinant VLPs have been approved for use as vaccines. recombinant baculovirus was generated by site-specific transposition of pFastBac/P12A3C into a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) propagated in DH10Bac cells. recombinant baculovirus (Bac-P12A3C) was plaque purified and then the presence of the P12A and 3C genes of pEMCV-K3 was confirmed by PCR using previously vero cells were infected with pEMCV-K3 grown in 6-well culture plates. expressed recombinant proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay. harvested cells were clarified by centrifugation, concentrated using polyethylene glycol precipitation. ten mice in each group were challenged intramuscularly with 0.1 ml of the pEMCV-K3 strain containing 106 TCID50/ml (1000MLD50/ml) per mouse. the rest in each group was analyzed for humoral immune response as described previous [17]. expression and identification of VLPs in vitro Sf9 cells were transfected with a bacmid contained the P12A and 3C genes. recombinant baculoviruses (Bac-P12A3C) were identified by plaque assay. spherically shaped structures with a diameter of about 30 nm were identified in Bac-P12A3C-infected cells. no such structures were observed in uninfected Sf 9 cells. TEM images of Sf9 cells infected with Bac-P12A3C. arrows indicate aggregation of VLPs. neutralizing antibodies in the pigs of Group 3 were increased 128 fold. those of Group 5 were increased 64 fold upon inoculation with a single dose of crude protein containing VLPs. the level of neutralizing antibodies in Group 4 (from 64 to 512 fold) was similar to that of group 2. the baculovirus expression system has been widely used for generation of these VLPs due to the high productivity of the system. in a previous study, we engineered a DNA vaccine that produced pEMCV-K3 VLPs and confirmed that the VLP antigen exhibited good antigenicity and protective immunity in mice. two doses of crude protein including VLPs were tested. the higher dose was 10-fold higher than the lower dose. no immunization related clinical signs were observed in any group. recombinant baculovirus was generated by site-specific transposition of pFastBac/P12A3C into a baculovirus shuttle vector (bacmid) propagated in DH10Bac cells (Invitrogen, USA) by using the Bac to Bac baculovirus expression system (Invitrogen, USA) according to manufacturer's instructions. vero cells were infected with pEMCV-K3 grown in 6-well culture plates. the expressed recombinant proteins were analyzed by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and Western blotting analysis as previously described. ten mice in each group were challenged intramuscularly with 0.1 ml of the pEMCV-K3 strain containing 106 TCID50/ml (1000MLD50/ml) per mouse. the remainder in each group was analyzed for humoral immune response as described previous [17]. the significance of the variability was determined by two-way ANOVA. a probability value (P) of 0.05 was considered significant. pEMCV-K3 strain (pEMCV-K3) isolated in 1990. recombinant baculovirus (Bac-P12A3C) was plaque purified. the presence of the P12A and 3C genes of pEMCV-K3 was confirmed. expression of recombinant proteins Sf9 cells in 6-well culture plates was infected. group 1 was inoculated with PBS as a negative control. group 2 was inoculated with commercial killed vaccine as a positive control. ten mice in each group were challenged intramuscularly with 0.1 ml. sera were collected every week for 50 days from immunized swine. neutralizing EMCV antibodies were detected in collected sera. mice were randomly divided into four groups, with fifteen mice in each group. group 3 and group 5 were inoculated once each with 2.0 g and 0.2 g of crude protein, respectively, which was extracted from Bac-P12A3C infected cells containing VLPs. after each immunization, all swine were observed for 30 min and monitored for clinical signs during the immunization period at 2 day intervals. blotting showed that a specific protein of the predicted size of 30 kDa (VP1) was observed in both Vero cells with the pEMCV-K3 strain and in Sf9 cells infected with Bac-P12A3C. expression and intracellular localization of recombinant baculovirus Bac-P12A3C as identified by immunofluorescence. group 3 and group 4 were immunized with 0.5 g and 0.1 g of crude protein containing VLPs. all ten mice immunized with the commercial vaccine were protected perfectly. only 60% of the mice immunized with 0.1 g of crude protein containing VLPs survived. swine in group 1 did not produce any detectable neutralizing antibodies. swine in group 1 did not produce any detectable neutralizing antibodies. swine in group 1 did not produce any detectable neutralizing antibodies. Western blotting analyses of recombinant baculovirus. Lane M, protein molecular weight marker; Lane 1, whole virus; Lane 2, Sf9 cells infected with Bac-P12A3C. hollow spherically shaped structures with a diameter of about 30 nm were identified. nine of the ten mice immunized with 0.5 g of crude protein containing VLPs were protected perfectly. only 60% of the mice immunized with 0.1 g of crude protein containing VLPs survived. survival curve was based on the number of mice surviving on various days post-challenge. the curve of NA was obtained from the average of two sera in each group. Arrows indicate the time of immunization. Discussion Virus-like particles are promising vaccine candidates for neutralizing antibody response. a linear relationship between levels of neutralizing antibody and protective efficacy of EMCV vaccines against lethal EMCV challenge has been demonstrated. two doses of crude protein including VLPs were tested, with the higher dose (2.0 g) 10-fold higher than the lower dose (0.2 g) porcine EMCV VLPs generated using a baculovirus expression system are safe and demonstrate good antigenicity and immunogenicity. authors declare that they have no competing interests."}
