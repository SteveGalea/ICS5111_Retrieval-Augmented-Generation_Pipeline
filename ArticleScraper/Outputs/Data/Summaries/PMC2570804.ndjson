{"summary": "the study The farm was a 3-site herd with a total of 6,000 sows. site 1 comprised 20 gestation barns and 19 farrowing barns. site 2 comprised 9 barns and site 3 comprised growing and fattening barns. postmortem examinations were performed on 16 affected piglets, 2\u201311 days of age. samples submitted for histopathologic examination included brainstem, trigeminal ganglia, tonsils, pyloric gland area of the stomach, jejunum, ileum, lymph nodes, heart, spleen, liver, kidneys, and lung. the reaction was performed in a total volume of 50 L containing 2 L RNA extract, 10 L 5 QIAGEN One-Step RT-PCR buffer, 2 L dNTPs mix, 1.8 L QIAGEN One-Step RT-PCR Enzyme Mix. the amplicons were purified by using the QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN) and sequenced on a megaBase 1000 DNA sequencer. RT-PCR analysis showed a product of the expected size for CoV (250 bp) in all analyzed brain samples. no amplification was observed in inoculated PK 15 cells. amplicons of 250 bp were found in brain samples from pigs 6, 8, 9 and 11 days of age. negative control (water + mastermix); PK15, amplification of PK15 cells inoculated with brain and tonsil from affected piglet; AP, asymptomatic piglet; and Ladder, 50-bp Fermentas. pensaert (3) reported perivascular cuffing and neuronal degeneration in pigs showing VWD. nonsuppurative encephalomyelitis was found in 50% of infected animals."}
