{"summary": "a guideline for the surveillance, reporting, diagnosis, and treatment of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was published on may 9, 2009. a confirmed case of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was defined as laboratory confirmation of infection from a human sample. a suspected case was defined as 1) an influenza-like illness (ILI; fever >37.5\u00b0C with at least 1 symptom or sign, including sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion) in all patients with a positive RT-PCR result for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus were admitted to the local infectious disease hospital where the patient was placed in isolation. additional specimens were sent to the State Reference Influenza Laboratories at the Chinese CDC or CAMS for further characterization and nucleic acid sequencing. a confirmed case of human infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was defined as laboratory confirmation of infection from a human sample. a suspected case was defined as 1) an influenza-like illness (ILI; fever >37.5\u00b0C with at least 1 symptom or sign, including sore throat, cough, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion) in a person who has traveled to a country where >1 confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 cases had been found in the past 7 days standardized surveillance reporting form was used to collect clinical, epidemiologic, or demographic data. included information about the patient\u2019s demographic characteristics, underlying medical conditions, status with respect to seasonal influenza vaccination, exposures to swine and other animals, chest radiograph results, laboratory findings, results of diagnostic testing for influenza, antiviral treatment, and clinical outcome. clinical characteristics of 3 patients infected with influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus, people\u2019s Republic of China, 2009. patient 1 left St. Louis, Missouri, USA, on may 7, 2009 (US date), and flew to st. Paul, Minnesota, USA, where he transferred to a flight to Tokyo, Japan, then to Beijing, China, arriving on May 8. patient 2 left Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, on may 7 (Canada date) he did not feel ill while traveling from Winnipeg to Beijing. he stayed for 2 days in Beijing, where a fever developed, but did not seek medical attention. all 3 patients were positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus by real-time RT-PCR. PCR products sequencing the partial hemagglutinin sequence from all 3 patients were 99.5\u2013100% homologous with A/California/4/2009 but only 79.4%\u201379.6% homologous with seasonal influenza virus (H1N1). 186 close contacts tested positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus by real-time RT-PCR. this sample came from the 48-year-old mother of patient 3, who had lived with patient 3 for 2 days before her illness. on the fifth day (May 16) after exposure to patient 3, this woman had no fever or ILI symptoms. 186 close contacts, including taxi drivers, passengers in an airplane or the same car of a train, had a positive result for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus by real-time RT-PCR. asymptomatic infections appear to be possible among household members, as demonstrated by case-patient 3 and her mother. the exact date of exposure to a known infectious source was difficult to trace. clinical features, severity, incubation period, and transmission patterns (14)."}
