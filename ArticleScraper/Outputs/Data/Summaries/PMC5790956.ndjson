{"summary": "porcine deltacoronavirus spike proteins are closely related to those from the alphacoronavirus genus. the protein is adapted to enteric infection and resistant to premature activation from enteric proteases. data elucidate evolution of lagovirus emergence. virulent (GI.1d) and nonvirulent (GI.4a) strain of lagovirus are required for virus budding. findings highlight the potential of this animal model to study serological responses and examine interventions that limit transmission."}
