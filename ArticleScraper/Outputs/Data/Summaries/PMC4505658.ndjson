{"summary": "in recent years, interest in bats has steadily increased because of the discovery that they ecologically maintain viruses pathogenic to humans. current data suggest that both natural and experimental viral infections are clinically asymptomatic in bats (3, 8\u201314) study shows that bats should have all of the cell types required for mounting an effective adaptive immune response. antibodies produced by bats should undergo class switching, VDJ recombination, and somatic hypermutation (27\u201331) Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (HeV) are two closely related paramyxoviruses whose reservoir hosts are the Pteropus genus of bats. the first outbreak of NiV occurred in 1998 in Malaysia. yearly outbreaks have occurred in Bangladesh. there is no evidence of phosphorylated STAT1 in henipavirus-infected vero cells treated with IFN. this is a block relieved by a mutation in the STAT1 binding site in the P gene. this supports the findings of Virtue et al. who report that immortalized cells from a Pteropus alecto bat do not produce IFN when infected with NiV or HeV. the kidney was minced, digested in trypsin, and suspended in fetal bovine serum (FBS) the solution was then centrifuged and filtered through a cell strainer to remove debris. cells were resuspended in 1 minimal essential medium with 10% FBS and plated in a 10-cm dish. at 48 h after dosing of the initial inoculum, cells were transferred to a new dish. 24 h later puromycin (Gemini) was added at a concentration 2 g/ml. all cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (HyClone) and 5% penicillin-streptomycin (Corning) expression of the V protein is restored by insertion of the V open reading frame. rNDV B1 V/NiV V (rNDV/NiV V) and rNDV B1 V/NiV W (rNDV/NiV W) have been described previously. PVK4 cells (1 105) were seeded into each well of 12-well plates and grown overnight. cells were infected with 1 105 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50s) at 12, 24, 48, and 72 hpi. purified RNA from mock-infected cells was poly(A) selected, converted to cDNA, ligated to platform-specific adapters, and amplified using an Illumina TruSeq RNA kit. reads containing rRNA or Illumina adapters were filtered. the remaining reads were mapped to the P. vampyrus genome build 1. putative mRNA sequences were extracted using the Cufflinks program-derived region on the genome and stored as a fastA file of nucleotide sequences. the sequences were compared to those in the nonredundant UniRef protein database using a translated nucleotide query against the protein sequences. qRT-PCR was performed on a Roche LightCycler 480 apparatus. validation primers used for human RPS18, RND1, MORC3, SERTAD1 and PPP1R15A were purchased from Bio-Rad. PVK4 cells (1 106) were seeded into each well of 12-well plates overnight. cells were infected with NiV or HeV at an MOI of 1, 5, or 10 in 250 l for 2 h. on the following day, cells were washed 3 times with PBS-T. PVK4 cells infected with rNDV/NDV, rNDV/NiV V, or rNDV/NiV W were harvested at 0, 8, and 24 h in 200 l 2 SDS lysis buffer with -mercaptoethanol (Sigma), freeze-thawed once, and boiled. lysate was separated on an SDS-polyacrylamide gel (Bio-Rad) and transferred to a polyvinylidene 7 105 GP2-293 cells were transfected with 2.5 g each of plasmids expressing vesicular stomatitis virus G glycoprotein and pBABE-hTERT-puro. the medium was changed at 24 h postinfection (hpi) and supernatant (2 ml) from transfected cells was harvested at 48 h. all cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% FBS (HyClone) and 5% penicillin-streptomycin (Corning) all cells were cultured from a kidney and then immortalized by ectopically expressing human telomerase using a Moloney murine leukemia virus system. the data shown are normalized to the level of actin expression. rNDV/NiV V (rNDV/NiV V) and rNDV B1 V/NiV W (rNDV/NiV W) are recombinant viruses also with mutations removing the P-gene edit site (deleting expression of the V protein) RNA from PVK4, PPVK, MVI, EidNi/41.2, RoNi/7.3, EpoNi/22.1, and A549 cells infected with NDVs or treated with universal IFN was purified using an RNeasy miniprep (Qiagen) kit. RNA from PVK4 cells infected with HeV or NiV was isolated using an RNeasy miniprep (Qiagen) kit following the manufacturer's protocols. s were mapped to the P. vampyrus genome build 1 using the topHat (v2) program and the Ensembl (release 75) gene annotation set as a reference. mapped read files were analyzed by using the HTSeq-Count script to generate a list of reads per exon gene model. DESeq R package was used to perform differential expression analysis. qRT-PCR was performed on a Roche LightCycler 480 apparatus. the top-scoring protein in the UniRef database was used to annotate the putative bat gene. RNA was harvested every 4 h for 24 h. data were analyzed using the normalized expression (2CT) or fold induction (2CT) threshold cycle (CT) method. values represent the means from three replicates, and error bars represent standard deviations. cells were seeded into each well of 12-well plates overnight. cells were infected with NiV or HeV at an MOI of 1, 5, or 10 in 250 l for 2 h. cells were then permeabilized with PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100 for 15 min. cells were then incubated overnight with anti-N antibody. DS-polyacrylamide gel was transferred to a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Bio-Rad) the membrane was blocked in PBS with 0.05% Tween 20 (Fisher) and 5% milk. polyclonal antibodies against NiV V and NiV W (70) were diluted in the PBS\u2013Tween 20\u2013milk solution. the mixture was incubated on individual membranes overnight at 4\u00b0C. cultures of both types of cells can support NDV infection and gene expression, establishing that NDV can be used to explore the response of P. vampyrus cells to virus infection. beta IFN (IFN-) and RIG-I are activation markers of the host innate immune response. the innate immune response of PVK4 cells protects against virus challenge. h of treatment with universal IFN caused the translocation of STAT1 into the nucleus. this further exemplifies the activation of JAK/STAT signaling in response to type I IFN in P. vampyrus cells. 82% of reads in mock-infected cells and 64% of total reads in infected cells were mapped to the genome using topHat. we also mapped 19% of the total reads (5% unique reads) from the infected cells to the rNDV genome. however, a negligible number of reads were mapped to the virus from the mock-infected sample. this shows a relatively good infection level in the infected cells. analysis was limited to reads that were mapped to the P. vampyrus genome using TopHat. compared with the gene expression in mock-infected cells, NDV infection upregulated 309 genes and downregulated 16 genes. 156 genes differentially expressed during NDV infection of PPVK cells are known ISGs in either humans or mice. further gene ontology analysis was performed using Ingenuity pathway analysis, which determined the cellular canonical pathways significantly enriched in the data set. we chose 22 of the 306 upregulated genes for validation using qRT-PCR analysis. we infected PVK4 cells with NDV over a 24-h time course. Virus infection increased the expression of all 22 genes, confirming the mRNAseq results. gene expression profiling of NDV-infected P. vampyrus cells elucidates potential differences between regulation of bat and human antiviral genes. we either treated PVK4 cells with universal IFN (10,000 U/ml, 24 h) or infected PVK4 cells with NDV (MOI = 2, 20 h) and monitored expression of select genes identified by the mRNAseq study. data are calculated as normalized CT values (CTtarget CTRPL11) darker boxes indicate higher levels of expression. bar graphs of fold induction of select genes from PVK4 cells (b) and A549 cells (c) we treated cells of the human lung cell line with universal IFN (2,000 U/ml, 24 h) or infected them with NDV (MOI = 2, 24 h) as a control for IFN signaling, we observed the induction of ISG56. only expression of SERTAD1 was significantly increased by universal IFN, but it was increased less than 2-fold compared with the level of expression in mock-infected cells. qRT-PCR primers were designed using the sequence of the P. vampyrus gene. increased expression of NDV NP in all infected cells demonstrates that all four cell lines respond to both NDV infection and IFN treatment. however, RND1 and MORC3 did not behave similarly in PVK4 cells. qRT-PCR analysis for NDV-NP (a), ISG56 (b), RND1 (c) and MORC3 (d) in PVK4, EidNi/41.2, EpoNi/22.1, RoNi/7.3, and MVI cells treated with IFN (2,000 U/ml) both viruses grew to a titer of approximately 106 TCID50s/ml. cells stained positively with an antibody that cross-reacts to the nucleocapsid proteins of both NiV and HeV. cells were infected at MOIs of 1, 5, and 10. NDV-GFP infection (MOI = 1) in PVK4 cells treated with universal IFN or UV-inactivated supernatant from henipavirus-infected (MOI = 10) or mock-infected PVK4 cells. data are shown as the ratio of the GFP signal to the ethidium bromide signal for staining of nuclei. henipavirus infection does not upregulate antiviral cytokines in cells. qRT-PCR data shows that henipavirus infection does not upregulate antiviral cytokines in P. vampyrus cells. iV W decreased expression of these genes to a greater extent than rNDV/NiV V. but this could have been due to different expression levels of the IFN antagonists. blocking of the innate immune response observed in PVK4 cells is most likely mediated by the V and W proteins. primary cells were cultured from a euthanized P. vampyrus bat at the Lubee Bat Conservancy in Gainesville, FL. we infected both primary and immortalized cell cultures with Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a potent activator of the mammalian antiviral response (65) supernatant from NDV-infected PVK4 cells restricted NDV-GFP infection in PVK4 cells. this indicates a species-specific protective activity of the antiviral cytokines produced by P. vampyrus cells. universal IFN, which is a recombinant form of IFN, protected both PVK4 and Vero cells against NDV-GFP infection. a draft genome of P. vampyrus is publically available. 82% of total reads in mock-infected cells and 64% of total reads in infected cells were mapped to the genome using topHat. a negligible number of reads mapped to the virus from the mock-infected sample. 1% of reads remained unmapped in mock-infected and infected samples. this value is considered reasonable for this type of analysis. mRNA-seq reads from NDV-infected PPVK cells Read group and infection Total no. of readsa % reads. portions of some of these transcripts showed homology at the protein level to known and putative genes in other species. for example, one of the transcripts showed homology to TRIM3. this homology was not seen at the nucleotide level, potentially indicating a gene that is highly divergent in bats compared to its degree of divergence in other mammalian species. the top 10 pathways are illustrated in Fig. 3, with the size of the gray circle corresponding to the P value. many genes are present in more than one pathway, showing the high degree of overlap between different immune pathways. gene expression profile is likely representative of an antiviral state in PVK4 cells. qRT-PCR for gene expression in PVK4 cells infected with NDV at an MOI of 2. levels of expression of NDV NP normalized to level of expression of the housekeeping gene RPL11. K4 cells upregulated all genes known to be ISGs. these genes included signaling molecules involved in the production of IFN- (RIG-I, MDA5), transcription factors (IRF1, IRF2), effector molecules (Mx1, BST2), and some with poorly characterized functions (GVIN, TRANK1). this suggests that virus infection has secondary signals that amplify these genes further. a lower concentration of universal IFN (2,000 U/ml, 24 h) provided results that were similar to those depicted in Fig. 5a and b. a lower concentration of universal IFN (2,000 U/ml), provided results that were similar to those depicted in Fig. 5a and b. a lower concentration of universal IFN (2,000 U/ml), provided results that were the same as those depicted in Fig. 5a and b. MORC3 is upregulated in response to both IFN and virus in PVK4 cells. RND1 was regulated by virus infection in both species but responded only to IFN in PVK4 cells. qRT-PCR primers were designed using sequence of the gene. IFN treatment induced RND1 only in PVK4 cells and not EidNi/41.2, EpoNi/22.1, RoNi/7.1, or MVI cells. the regulation of MORC3 varied among the cells from the different bat species. PVK4 cells support henipavirus replication but do not elicit an innate immune response following infection. the NDV IFN antagonist protein is nonfunctional in mammalian cells (65) to test the ability of P. vampyrus cells to support and respond to one of its natural pathogens. qRT-PCR of PVK4 cells infected with HeV and NiV at an MOI of 10. levels of expression of NiV L and HeV L normalized to the level of expression of RPL11. we examined the expression of 11 genes confirmed to be upregulated by NDV in PVK4 cells. henipavirus infection does not upregulate antiviral cytokines in cells. henipavirus infection does not upregulate antiviral cytokines in cells. PVK4 cells infected with rNDV expressing NiV or NiV W showed expression of NDV NP at levels equal to (rNDV/NiV V) or greater than (rNDV/NiV W) levels of expression by rNDV. rNDV/NiV W decreased expression of these genes to a greater extent than rNDV/NiV V. qRT-PCR analysis of genes in PVK4 cells infected with recombinant NDVs expressing either NDV V, NiV V, or NiV W. genes were selected from those in Fig. 4b. studies have predicted the structures of select immune receptors, signaling molecules, and transcription factors, such as TLRs (32, 33), RLRs (34, 40), type I and type III IFNs (35\u201337), and other cytokines (73). mRNAseq technology on P. vampyrus cells infected with NDV is known to induce a robust immune response in mammalian cells. mRNAseq analysis of NDV-infected P. vampyrus cells revealed upregulation of genes enriched in antiviral immune pathways. a second poorly characterized ISG is GVIN1 (GTPase, very large interferon inducible 1). GVIN1 is in the family of IFN-induced GTPases. rodents express seven members of the GVIN family, but primates do not express any GVIN family protein. an immune gene that is present in these orders but is absent in humans is potentially an important player in how rodents and bats function as reservoirs. there is no evidence that these genes are ISGs in humans or mice. RC3 (also known as NXP2) is a nuclear protein with RNA binding activity (84) and is reported to localize to promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies in a SUMO-dependent manner. this is reminiscent of PML itself, a TRIM family member that is induced by IFN and has antiviral activity. SERTAD1 is a transcriptional regulator that interacts with PHD zinc fingers present in transcription factors. it is involved in cyclin E-mediated cell cycle progression and is believed to be an antiapoptosis factor in cancer cells (88\u201390) no immune or antiviral role has been described for SERTAD1. a lack of IFN production from NiV- and HeV-infected cells could stem from one of two causes: not enough signal from the infection was present to stimulate a response. this could be demonstrated through the use of rNDVs expressing NiV IFN antagonists (V and W), which failed to induce IFN or ISGs. chiroptera diverged approximately 63 million years ago (101) and comprises 20% of all mammalian species (2), making it a very diverse order. neither Sendai virus nor the bat reovirus pteropine orthoreovirus NB caused the upregulation of PKR (EIF2AK2) in P. alecto lung cells."}
