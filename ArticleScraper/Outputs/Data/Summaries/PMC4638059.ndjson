{"summary": "anthropologist and forensic psychiatry pioneer Cesare Lombroso is notorious for his idea that crime originates from specific individual anomalies. 'criminal science' should facilitate early identification of \u2018moral insanity\u2019 to foresee which individuals risk developing criminal behaviour. 'criminal science' should facilitate early identification of \u2018moral insanity\u2019 to foresee which individuals risk developing criminal behaviour. the new Lombrosian vision has resurfaced in the wake of advances of behavioural genetics, neuroscience and psychiatric and criminological epidemiology. it has attracted some critical attention in mass media, but has so far received sparse scrutiny from ethical standpoints. the idea of basing both penal and preventive criminal policy on forensic psychiatric risk assessment brings scientific and ethical hazards of its own. this article aims to facilitate further specific inquiry into this intersection of bio, legal and social ethics by providing a critical overview of the new Lombrosian vision from a public health perspective. the bioethical discussion of screening programmes is summed up in section 5. the results are summed up in section 5, noting that our analysis results in a theoretical framework for further, more specific ethical analysis of the intersection of criminal and public health policy. the new Lombrosian vision (as indeed the older ones) share a general form of the following type. conception of I, using methods for preconception, preimplantation or prenatal genetic testing or risk assessment already in clinical use. that would facilitate a P of the same form applied already today for family planning on genetic grounds, using partner, gamete or embryo or foetus selection to avoid possible future Is where F is present. genetic explanation of crime may also ground other types of P. the category of \u2018antisocial personality and behaviour\u2019 includes a wide variation of behaviour, a lot of which is not illegal. no evidence presently suggests that one single gene could be found that controls a certain behaviour, but rather that behaviour is influenced by a great number of genes working together in close interaction with complex environmental factors. the evidence base of the neurobiological version of the new Lombrosian vision is so far rather weak. the methodological challenges to moving forward are partly similar to in the genetic case. a substantial limitation is the small sample size and the absence of controls in studies held out by neurocriminology advocates. if neurobiology is able to adopt a large-scale big data approach, a number of preventive intervention strategies become open for a P to test. the fact that the specific T may remain uncertain, while the conditions b and c may nevertheless be met points towards a final approach to the new Lombrosian vision. the vast majority of violent crimes are perpetrated by a small number of persistent violent offenders, almost all males, who have an early onset of violent criminality. the findings support the provision of far-reaching interventions among young individuals who have committed one or two violent crimes. map of 27 generic new Lombrosian strategies based on three main variants each of when and how broadly the detection of F is to occur. these variants range from prenatal or even preconceptual detection of Is with F throughout the entire population to the most restricted approach of further probing young criminal offenders to assess risk of recidivism. a variety of factors may make practitioners, policymakers and people in general perceive some Lombrosian strategy as promising or even ripe for implementation in spite of weak evidence. current standard opinions, e.g. that prenatal screening targeting some alleged criminality gene is out of the question, may change just as quickly as past eugenic stances once transformed into the more liberal views that prevail in this area of medicine. the evidence in favour of any more specific T is so far uncertain, to say the least. such a T would allow detection of F even before birth, implantation or, ultimately, even conception of I, using methods for preconception, preimplantation or prenatal genetic testing. a genetic explanation of crime may also ground other types of P (see further below) evidence for a strong genetic explanation of the wider phenomenon of \u2018antisocial personality and behaviour\u2019 may at the moment look more compelling. however, such explanations typically use diagnoses already conceptually assuming criminality or antisocial violence, making the suggested causal mechanism behind criminality imply circularity. the correlation between mental disorder and forensic risk tends to disappear when sources of that are discounted for. neuroscientific findings may serve as a T. this is the new Lombrosian vision of neurocriminology (Raine, 2013; Glenn and Raine, 2014), where particular neuobiological phenomena are thought to be substantial parts of the cause of criminality. such a T would not facilitate the far-reaching prospect of selecting against future people on the basis of forensic risk promised by the genetic approach. a neurobiological T may remain uncertain, while the conditions b and c may still be met points towards a final approach to the new Lombrosian vision. the T is limited to mapping epidemiological linkage between crime and detectable behavioural, biological or social factors, focusing on particularly burdened populations. the vast majority of violent crimes are perpetrated by a small number of persistent violent offenders, almost all males, who have an early onset of violent criminality. the findings support the provision of far-reaching interventions among young individuals who have committed one or two violent crimes. an early onset of antisocial aggressive behaviour (in childhood) as F, will make the detection of F less problematic from a methodological standpoint. these variants range from the ambitious project of prenatal or even preconceptual detection of Is with F throughout the entire population to the most restricted approach of further probing young criminal offenders. theoretically available new Lombrosian generic strategies may appear more or less likely (or far-fetched) neither of the versions presuppose that the scientific and technical problems mentioned earlier have been \u2018overcome\u2019 in any simple sense. the ethics of screening and the Lombrosian vision in general Regardless of exact version, the new Lombrosian vision is at heart a population screening approach to crime and criminality. criminality is viewed as a societal problem of importance to prevent or mitigate through early identification of individuals at risk followed by effective interventions in the same way as ill health is viewed. an analogous issue seems to appear in the new Lombrosian case. it is quite conceivable that an I, who would be classified as high risk for a crime type that is serious in one of these senses, would not be high risk for crimes. the choice of target would, in any case, be a choice of what criminality is more important to prevent, it may also affect what people are being targeted. the better a method correctly identifies high-risk Is as high risk, the worse it will be at correctly abstaining from identifying low-risk Is as high risk. the better it identifies low-risk Is as low risk, the worse it will be at abstaining from identifying high-risk Is as low risk. in the new Lombrosian case, the picture is similar in that an I falsely identified as possessing F risks being subjected to unmotivated measures. however, these may be to the disbenefit of I even in the case of a true positive, with reasons referring to the protection of others and society motivating why they should nevertheless be applied. this adds to the ethical complications already sketched in two respects. how well a suggested programme can be expected to work will depend on the correct T. a more complicated causal history of crime will undermine the PPV. in the new Lombrosian case, only one type of P is easily comparable to the health case, that of treatment. this strategy will, if efficacious, reduce the forensic risk of I, while leaving him or her unrestrained and in contact with society. if combined with a release from otherwise applied measures of restriction and/or exclusion, it may even serve to promote the inclusion and liberty of I. a forensic risk-map is likely to be quite complex further discourages the prospect of any straightforward effective Lombrosian treatment P. this leaves restriction and exclusion types of P strategies which (if efficacious) reduce or cancel the crime risk, but not to the benefit of I. this is akin to draconian communicable disease management in situations when no cure for highly contagious and severe conditions exists, and isolation and quarantine become the remaining options to fight an epidemic. the perception of oneself as possessing a negative feature will affect the close social surroundings of I (family, friends, school, neighbourhood and workplace) negative stigma effects are typically of three kinds: overprotection (impeding I from developing), distancing (impoverishing I\u2019s social support) and preventive defence (treating I as an acute danger) autonomy, Consent and Counselling is a recognized theme of health screening ethics. the view of personal autonomy, the role and importance of consent and the nature of counselling is more complicated than in clinical and health research ethics. the idea of a least restrictive/intrusive alternative standard may be held out as a reason to retain as much of an individualistic stance. counselling of some sort has to be a standard element if a new Lombrosian programme is to have any degree of voluntariness. counselling, just as in many health screening programmes (Juth and Munthe, 2012: 87\u201388), may also be a key element in achieving the programme objectives. the choice of target would be a choice of what criminality is more important to prevent, it may also affect what people are being targeted, burdened, protected and so on. the choice of target would be a choice of what criminality is more important to prevent, but may also affect what people are being targeted, burdened and protected. the better a method correctly identifies high-risk Is as high risk, the worse it will be at correctly abstaining from identifying low-risk Is as low risk. both false negatives and false positives are quite different from health screening, where the I risks harm due to undetected health problems. in the new Lombrosian case, the picture is similar in that an I falsely identified as possessing F risks being subjected to unmotivated measures. however, these may be to the disbenefit of I even in the case of a true positive. in the most extreme instance, there will be Is who never come to exist at all or who will be excluded from society due to a falsely attributed risk of future criminality. the more the target is risks of extremely grave and rare criminality. the less likely predictions made are correct, thus motivating a weighting down of the confidence of assessed risks. the intervention: Efficacy, Side Effects and the Therapeutic Gap. the new Lombrosian vision will suffer from what, in the ethical discussion of human genetics has become known as \u2018the therapeutic gap\u2019. there is an uncertain and rather limited palette of invasive neuromedicine, so far basically untried in a new Lombrosian setting, some pharmacological treatments for various neuro-behavioural conditions with unsure effects on forensic risks. the most extreme version of exclusion approaches (the preconception or prenatal one) would attract a whole body of critique against eugenics. most extreme version of exclusion approaches (the preconception or prenatal one) would attract a whole body of critique against eugenics. stigmatization is a phenomenon highlighted in health screening ethics in terms of stigmatization. negative stigma effects are typically of three kinds: overprotection (impeding I from developing), distancing (impoverishing I\u2019s social support) and preventive defence (treating I as an acute danger) the public health element of (effective) screening programmes makes a strict individualistic view of protecting autonomy and designing consent procedures less convincing. the idea of a least restrictive/intrusive alternative standard may be held out as a reason to retain as much of an individualistic stance as compatible with a reasonable preventive effect. the specific criminal law policy framing of the new Lombrosian vision may turn this logic either way. counselling, just as in many health screening programmes, may also be a key element in achieving the programme objectives. both pre- and post-testing counselling procedures need to be pondered and designed in conjunction with the idea of what sort of P is planned, what is needed to have that intervention effective and how to avoid negative side effects. in criminal law, we find a deeply embedded jurisprudential ideal of letting clemency prevail. in public health policy, there is a much stronger tradition of accepting broken eggs to have the omelette. in criminal law, there is a much stronger tradition of accepting broken eggs to have the omelette, at least when circumstances are dire. public opinion may be seen as posing a threat to the upholding of decent ethical principles. in the criminal law context, this is handled by upholding strict meta-principles of legal security and the rule of law. but it is unclear what counterparts to such safeguards are present in the public health area."}
