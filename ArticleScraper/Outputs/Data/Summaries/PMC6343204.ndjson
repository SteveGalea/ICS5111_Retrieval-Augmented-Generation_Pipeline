{"summary": "evidence has demon-strated that chemokine receptor CXCR3 may play a pivotal role in the development of neurological diseases. this review is to provide evidence for the potential of CXCR3 as a therapeutic target for neurological diseases. the chemokine receptor CXCR3 belongs to the CXC chemokine receptor family. it is a G protein-coupled receptor that plays a vital role in mediating chemotactic migration, cell proliferation, and survival. the principle chemokine ligands of CXCR3 are CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10 and CXCL11. these studies suggested an important role of CXCR3 in neurological diseases. targeting CXCR3 may reveal novel therapeutic interventions for the management of neurological diseases. here we summarize the current evidence supporting a role of CXCR3. multiple sclerosis (MS), also known as disseminated sclerosis, is a chronic inflammatory disease of the CNS which is characterized by destruction of myelin and oligodendrocytes in the brain and spinal cord. compared with secondary progressive MS, the concentration of CXCL10 was significantly greater in patients with relapsing/remitting. increased level of CXCR3 positive T-cells in the CSF was strongly associated with active MRI lesion appearance in patients with relapsing/remitting MS. encephalomyelitis (EAE), a rodent model of human MS, is a CD4+ Th1 cell- and Th17 cell-mediated demyelinating disease of the CNS. blocking CXCR3 or neutralization of its ligands would inhibit the development of EAE. inflammatory lesions consisted of well-demarcated perivascular mononuclear cell infiltrates. also, Foxp3+ regulatory T cells were significantly reduced in number. results suggest that CXCR3 signaling plays a major protective role in EAE by constraining CD4+ T cells to the perivascular space. astrocytes and neurons may recruit pathogenic T lymphocytes into areas of the brain of Rasmussen encephalitis through the CXCL10-CXCR3 axis. astrocytes upregulated the mRNA expression level of CXCL10 and release of CXCL10 to the supernatants in response to infections. expression level of CXCR3 correlated with malignancy grade of glioma. glioblastoma multiforme is most aggressive form of human glioma. glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most aggressive form of human glioma. both CXCR3 and its ligands are expressed by murine and human glioma cell lines (A172, T98G, U87, U118 and U138) these results suggest that CXCR3 system may be a unique target for human GBM therapy. neuronal processes in the neocortex, hippocampal formation, striatum, cerebellum and spinal cord were greatly upregulated. also, CXCL10 positive astrocytes were frequently associated with amyloid deposits, suggesting an active chronic inflammatory response occurs in AD patients. s disease patients control CCL4 and CXCL10 levels in a human blood brain barrier model. these studies indicated a pivotal role of CXCR3 in the pathogenesis of AD. however, further studies are warranted to explore the underlying mechanisms. spinal phosphorylation of Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2) was markedly upregulated in BCP rats. blockage of either Akt or pERK1/2 attenuated the mechanical allodynia in BCP rats. ando et al. [96] investigated the possible role of CXCL10/CXCR3 signaling in chronic inflammation of HAM/TSP. they found that the expression level of CXCL10 was markedly high in the CSF of HAM/TSP patients. astrocytes were the major producers of CXCL10 in the spinal cords of HAM/TSP patients. BD patients had increased plasma levels of CXCL11, CCL24, CXCL10, and decreased plasma levels of CXCL8 in contrast with healthy controls. chemokines levels were not significantly different between BD patients in euthymia and mania. focused on chemokines and neurological diseases may lead to the discovery of novel therapeutic strategies for patients suffering from various neurological disorders connected with neuroinflammation. the authors declare no conflict of interest, financial or otherwise."}
