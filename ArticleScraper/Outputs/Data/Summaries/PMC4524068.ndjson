{"summary": "Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) imports its capsid proteins into the host nucleus for assembly. the exact mechanism is not well understood. herpesviruses have evolved a unique nuclear egress mechanism. progeny nucleocapsids acquire primary envelopes by budding through the inner nuclear membrane (primary envelopment), followed by fusion of the enveloped nucleocapsids with the outer nuclear membrane (de-envelopment). p32 is recruited by UL47 to the nuclear membrane. the findings provide further evidence to support the existence of RNAi-mediated antiviral responses in mammalian cells. influenza virus adapts to the absence of cellular factors, in this case importin-7 knockout."}
