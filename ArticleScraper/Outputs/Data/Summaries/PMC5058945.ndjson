{"summary": "most viral lower respiratory tract infections are community-acquired and account for a significant etiology in mechanically ventilated patients with severe community-acquired pneumonia. METHODS Subjects and Study Design This was a single-center, observational cohort study of patients with a positive respiratory virus panel (RVP) the study protocol was approved by the Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Washington University and St. Louis College of Pharmacy Institutional Review Boards. adult patients (19 years of age) admitted to the hospital for >24 h were identified through a query of an internal database, which tracks respiratory viruses and evaluated for study inclusion. study protocol was approved by the Barnes-Jewish Hospital, Washington University and St. Louis College of Pharmacy Institutional Review Boards. adult patients (19 years of age) admitted to the hospital for >24 h were identified through a query of an internal database. patients excluded if no virus was identified by RVP, rhinovirus or enterovirus was identified by nasopharyngeal (NP) swab only. determination of APACHE II scores was based on physical and laboratory findings on the day the index RVP was obtained. all available aerobic and anaerobic bacterial cultures were evaluated based on eMR query. endpoints included hospital length-of-stay (LOS), intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and readmission rates at 30, 90, and 180 days after the index hospitalization. Univariate analyses were performed to compare survivors and nonsurvivors. all tests were 2-tailed and P values 0.05 were considered significant. logistic regression analysis was then used to determine factors independently associated with in-hospital mortality. RESULTS Study Population and Patient Characteristics A total of 284 adult patients were identified as having viral pneumonia. most patients with multiple viruses were immunocompromised (10 of 14) 73 patients with influenza received oseltamivir and 16.4% received investigational intravenous zanamivir. inhaled ribavirin was administered to 21.6% (n = 8) of patients with RSV and 4.6% (n = 13) of patients overall. aspergillus sp. were the most common fungal organisms seen (50%; n = 7) other fungi identified included Arthrographis sp., Bipolaris sp., Paecilomyces sp., Scedosporium sp., and Dematiaceous fungi imperfecti. ICU length-of-stay was variable (median: 10.3 days; IQR: 4.4, 20.7) readmissions were common with several patients re-hospitalized within 30 (21.1%) and 90-days (36.7%) of discharge. most patients were Caucasian (66.9%) most patients with multiple viruses were immunocompromised (10 of 14) 73 patients with influenza, 56.2% (n = 41) received oseltamivir and 16.4% (n = 12) received investigational intravenous zanamivir. inhaled ribavirin was administered to 21.6% (n = 8) of patients with RSV. aspergillus sp. were the most common fungal organisms seen (50%; n = 7) other fungi identified included Arthrographis sp., Bipolaris sp., Paecilomyces sp., Scedosporium sp., and Dematiaceous fungi imperfecti. study described 284 hospitalized adult patients with viral pneumonia. it assessed factors associated with increased in-hospital mortality in a multivariable model. identification of multiple viruses by RVP, stem-cell transplant, APACHE II score, and requirement of vasopressors were all significantly associated with in-hospital mortality. bacterial pneumoniae was the most frequently identified co-infecting bacterial pathogen among patients with a mixed viral-bacterial pneumonia. this study found more frequent bacterial co-infection with only 5 patients (11.1%) having a pure viral infection compared to 19 (42.2%) with mixed viral-bacterial infections. all cases in this study occurred in a 20-month period at a single institution. this study describes hospitalized adult patients with viral pneumonia and factors associated with in-hospital mortality. recognition of multiple viruses as a poor prognostic indicator is of interest."}
