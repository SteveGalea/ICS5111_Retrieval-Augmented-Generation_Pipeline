{"summary": "influenza viruses infect 5 to 15% of the global population annually, resulting in 250,000 to 500,000 deaths (4\u20136) in the united states alone, influenza viruses infect >50 million people annually. new diagnostic approaches are required for early initiation of antiviral therapy and prophylaxis to control infection during seasonal and pandemic outbreaks. antibodies lnA108 and 5D8 (for influenza A virus detection) and 1B6/B3 and 8L390 (for influenza B virus detection) were selected for FluA and FluB ENIAs. the entire procedure could be completed in 1 h. the fluB ENIA detected the 10 influenza B virus strains with no cross-reactivity observed with influenza A and the respiratory viruses. the analytical sensitivities of the ENIAs were evaluated by testing serially diluted egg or tissue culture-grown pretitrated stocks of reference strains of influenza viruses A/Brisbane/59/07 (H1N1), A/California/07/09. the performance of the ENIAs was compared to that of a commercial photometric influenza A and B antigen capture ELISA (Virusys Corporation, USA) the performance of the ENIAs was compared to that of a commercial photometric influenza A and B antigen capture ELISA (Virusys Corporation, USA) the clinical performance of the ENIAs was evaluated using a total of 193 nasopharyngeal swab specimens submitted during the 2012-2013 flu season. the initial detection and subtyping of the clinical samples were done using a direct fluorescent-antibody assay (DFA) and/or a real-time TaqMan PCR assay (12, 13) at Yale New Haven Hospital. PCR assay, 162 (83%) were positive for influenza A virus, 11 (5%) were positive for influenza B virus, and 20 (10%) were negative for both influenza A and B viruses. in-house RT-PCR assay correctly detected all 173 (100%) influenza-positive clinical samples included pandemic 2009 H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 viruses. no cross-reactivity was observed with influenza-negative clinical samples. twenty clinical specimens that previously tested negative showed no reactivity with either fluA or fluB ENIAs. this approach is cost-effective and easily adaptable to point-of-care formats. the ENIA-based diagnostic approach holds promise for use in a point-of-care setting for rapid and accurate diagnosis."}
