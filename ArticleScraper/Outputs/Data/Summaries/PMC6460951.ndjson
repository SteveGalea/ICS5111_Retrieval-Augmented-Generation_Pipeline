{"summary": "the most insidious primary vasculitis in childhood is Kawasaki syndrome (KS), an acute multi-systemic illness which predominantly affects children under 5 years of age. this condition of unknown etiology remains the main cause of acquired heart disease among children living in developed countries. the disease has been described worldwide in children of every ethnicity following the presence of fever persisting (at least) 5 days together with (at least) 4 of the 5 following signs: bilateral conjunctival injection, oroph KS is most prominently recognized in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. there is still much controversy about the etiology of KS. there is no agreement whether KS-related infectious agents are of viral, bacterial or fungal origin. a microbial community of trillions of microorganisms plays a contributory role in many infections, immune-mediated disorders, rheumatologic diseases, and disorders of the nervous system. the gut microbiota is strictly linked to the chronological age of each individual and modulates host physiology and metabolism through different mechanisms. each stage of human life is characterized by a specific intestinal microbial composition. resemblance of infants' stool microbial community with mothers' milk and vaginal samples. a mixture of microbes is broadly very similar to an adult's intestine. during adulthood, the gut microbiota becomes stable and this intestinal homeostasis remains in equilibrium with the host. intestinal mucosa may be considered as an immunological niche as it hosts a complex immune-functional organ comprised of T cell subpopulations, neutrophils, macrophage-dendritic cells, enterocytes and their related anti-inflammatory cytokines. intestinal microbiota may also have direct or indirect effects on the natural course of viral infections. the microbiota can maintain a segregation between intestinal mucosa and bacteria via PRRs. leaks in the intestinal mucosal barrier lead to translocation of bacterial products into portal circulation which promotes systemic inflammation. changes in the local microbial communities have been linked to chronic low-grade inflammation. etiology of KS remains obscure, although clinical and epidemiological features suggest a primary infectious cause. a self-limited and generally nonrecurring illness manifests itself by fever, rash, mucositis, conjunctival injection, and cervical adenopathy fits well with an infection. etiology of KS remains obscure, although clinical features suggest a primary infectious cause. non-infectious factors associated with KS include carpet shampoo, preexisting eczema, environmental pollution, and house dust mites (42). the higher incidence of KS in Asian populations, presence of familial clustering, and elevated risk of recurrence vs. a first episode in KS-nave children are all strong evidence of a genetic contribution to KS susceptibility. infusion of visfatin, a major injurious adipokine, can activate NLRP3 inflammasome and increase interleukin (IL)-1 production. this leads to enhanced endothelial dysfunction. new molecular mechanisms of vasculitis mediated by inflammasome activation open more specifically the road to innate immunity pathways in the interpretation of KS. adenovirus has been detected in 8.8 and 25% of cases with complete and incomplete KS. adenovirus has been detected in 8.8 and 25% of cases with complete and incomplete KS. adenovirus has been detected in 8.8 and 25% of cases. many studies have investigated the involvement of SAgs in KS. one of the first studies showed the selective expansion of T cell receptor (TCR) V2-bearing T cells in the peripheral blood of children during the acute phase of KS. study analyzed relationship between SAgs and KS in 36 patients with KS. authors examined genes related to five Sags using polymerase chain reaction. at least one of the SAg-related genes was detected more frequently in KS. bacteria or viruses associated with KS have a higher prevalence in the pediatric population, but only a limited number of children will develop the disease. the association of genetic predisposition and environmental factors in the pathogenetic process of KS makes KS similar to other multifactorial diseases. a perturbation in the intestinal microbiota has been linked to the disease's pathophysiology in another study by Yamashiro et al. (86) who investigated the microflora of the small intestine in 15 Japanese patients with KS. a delayed-type hypersensitivity reaction was indeed present in the small intestinal mucosa of KS patients. takeshita et al. evaluated 20 patients with KS, 20 patients with acute febrile diseases and 20 healthy children. the incidence of Lactobacilli isolated from KS patients was significantly lower (p 0.001) than in the other cohorts. however, no significant differences were observed between KS patients and healthy children. microorganisms isolated from the jejunal mucosa of 19 children with KS compared with 15 age-matched healthy controls. they identified 13 strains of Gram-negative microbes from patients with KS, which produced a large amount of Hsp60. also identified 18 strains of Gram-positive cocci with SAg properties which induced the expansion of V2 T cells in vitro. all presented studies confirm the concept that an imbalance in the gut microbiota might directly or indirectly interfere with the normal functions of the immune system. the interaction with other environmental factors, mainly infectious agents, might lead to the final development of KS. c higher in KS patients during non-acute phase of the disease. basic research evaluating the pathogenic mechanisms of this disease will probably provide better therapies. a relationship should exist between dysbiosis and immunity dysfunction shown by various diseases (97) conflict of interest Statement The authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
