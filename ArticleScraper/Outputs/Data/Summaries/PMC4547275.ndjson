{"summary": "a 49-y-old man from Qatar (14) was hospitalized with severe respiratory failure. diagnosis was established by RT-PCR detection of corona virus. a pseudotyped luciferase-based MERS-CoV neutralization assay developed. LCA60 antibody was further tested against three infectious MERS-CoV isolates (E) and several EMC MERS-CoV MARMs (F) a single B-cell culture out of 4,600 showed neutralizing activity. both LCA60 and LCA57 bound to the S protein from the EMC strain. the antibodies and the receptor were immobilized on the sensor surface, followed by injection of S protein at the concentrations indicated in the figure. a codon-optimized gene was synthesized and cloned into a double gene expression vector that was used to transfect the Lonza CHO-K1SV-GS-KO cell line. the sequence of the S genes showed that both MARMs carried two identical mutations, V33A in the N-terminal region and E536A in the RBD. to map the LCA60 epitope, we used computational predictions and experimental validation. we generated multiple models of LCA60 and docked each of them independently to the MERS-CoV RBD structure using the RosettaDock program (16) the docking algorithm identified two equally plausible models of the LCA60\u2013RBD complex. in both models, the antibody interacts with RBD residues around K493, but only in model A does the antibody interact with residues in the region. Fig. S3. Computational docking results, scoring chart. selected docking models were subjected to a refinement stage. LCA60 and 3B11 compete for binding to RBD, whereas LCA57 did not compete with either LCA60 or 3B11. results of surface plasmon resonance cross-competition experiments showed that LCA60 and 3B11 compete for binding to RBD, whereas LCA57 did not compete with either LCA60 or 3B11. the LCA60 produced in the CHO cell line was tested in mice sensitized to MERS-CoV infection by transduction with adenoviral vectors expressing human CD26 (17). in this model, as a result of virus receptor expression on lung cells, MERS-CoV gains entry to lungs and replicates as in human disease. replication and pathology are limited and the virus is cleared by day 7. mice were then infected with 1 105 pfu MERS-CoV intranasally. titers in the lungs were measured at the indicated time points. administration of LCA60 at 15 mg/kg i.p. 1 d after infection reduced lung viral titers by more than three logs in mice infected with both London and EMC strains. n = 3 mice per group per time point. titers in the lungs were measured at the indicated time points. additional groups of animals were monitored daily for morbidity, mortality, and body weight loss up to 14 d after infection (C) neutralization assay developed using the sequence of the S protein of the autologous virus. donor serum samples obtained 5 and 8 mo after infection showed only modest neutralizing activity. supernatants were screened using a pseudotyped neutralization assay and an ELISA on fixed MERS-CoV\u2013infected cells. both LCA60 and LCA57 bound to the S protein from the EMC strain. but not to the S protein of HKU4.2 (group IIC, 67% amino acid identity) and HKU3 (group IIB, 30% amino acid identity) a codon-optimized gene was synthesized and cloned into a double gene expression vector that was used to transfect the Lonza CHO-K1SV-GS-KO cell line. a high-producing research cell line, called LCA60.273.1, was isolated. the whole process of isolating the antibody and producing the stable cell line was completed in less than 4 mo. a combination of computational predictions and experimental validation was used to map the LCA60 epitope. the experimental structure of MERS-CoV RBD was available (10, 11) the structure of LCA60 was predicted by homology modeling according to the canonical structure method (15). model A does the antibody interact with residues in the 540\u2013543 region. introducing mutations in the latter region is expected to affect antibody binding if model A is correct. these mutations should not affect binding if model B is correct. docking models were subjected to a refinement stage, shown here for model A (Top) and model B (Bottom) each diamond represents a docking model (10,000 were generated); the rmsd from a reference structure is shown on the x axis; the docking algorithm score is shown on the y axis. results of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) cross-competition experiments showed that LCA60 and 3B11 compete for binding to RBD. LCA57, LCA60, 3B11 antibodies and CD26 receptor (ligands) were first immobilized on different channels (vertical column) of the SPR chip. the LCA60 produced in the CHO cell line was tested in mice sensitized to MERS-CoV infection by transduction with adenoviral vectors expressing human CD26 (17). hCD26-transduced mice were treated by i.p. injection of LCA60 at 1, 5, or 15 mg/kg either 1 d before (day \u20131) or 1 dafter intranasal infection. mice were then infected with 1 105 pfu MERS-CoV intranasally. titers in the lungs were measured at the indicated time points. n = 3\u20134 mice per group per time point. the lungs were measured at the indicated time points. n = 3 mice per group per time point. the efficacy of LCA60 was also evaluated in a more stringent model. titers in the lungs were measured at the indicated time points. additional groups of animals were monitored daily for morbidity, mortality, and body weight loss. a human neutralizing antibody can be isolated, characterized, and produced in large amounts in cell lines compatible for human use in a short period of only a few months. a human neutralizing antibody can be isolated, characterized, and produced in large amounts in cell lines compatible for human use in a short period of only a few months. LCA60 binds to an epitope in the S protein RBD with subnanomolar affinity and potently neutralizes MERS-CoV infection of multiple isolates. the epitope has partial overlap with the RBD\u2013CD26 receptor interface. inhibition of virus\u2013receptor interactions is at least one major mechanism of LCA60 neutralization. anti-MERS-CoV monoclonal antibodies, screening, in vitro characterization of antibodies, and testing in vivo can be found in SI Methods. cultures were tested for their ability to neutralize MERS-CoV London pseudovirus infection in a microneutralization assay. allotype used is the G1m3 and the lambda allotype is IGLC2*01. the single-gene vectors containing the VH and VL sequences of the LCA60 antibody were fused to form a double-gene vector. both alleles of the endogenous glutamine synthetase gene have been \u201cknocked out\u201d by introduction of overlapping, out-of-frame deletions. HEK293T/17 was cotransfected with an S-expressing plasmid (phCMV1) and with a complementing viral\u2013genome reporter gene vector, pNL4-3.Luc+.E-R+. a single-cycle infectivity assay was used to measure the neutralization of luciferase-encoding virions pseudotyped with the MERS-CoV S protein. S protein (Sino Biological) was injected at a flow rate of 100 L/min (contact time, 3 min) at different concentrations. the epitope regions were investigated by a SPR cross-competition experiment. the structure of S protein RBD is available (10, 11) and was used for docking. each antibody model was docked to RBD. two equally acceptable LCA60\u2013RBD models were selected. mice were infected intranasally with MERS-CoV in a total volume of 50 L DMEM. mice were monitored daily for morbidity and mortality. mice were lightly anesthetized with isoflurane and treated with antibodies in 50 L PBS intraperitoneally 1 d after infection. culture supernatants were tested for their ability to neutralize MERS-CoV London pseudovirus infection in a microneutralization assay. from positive cultures, the VH and VL sequences were retrieved. the pXC-IgG1 and pXC-Lambda vectors are cloned into the pXC-IgG1 and lambda vectors. the lambda allotype is IGLC2*01 (GenBank accession no. J00253, lambda 2 isotype) the single-gene vectors containing the VH and VL sequences of the LCA60 antibody were then fused to form a double a single-cycle infectivity assay was used to measure the neutralization of luciferase-encoding virions pseudotyped with the MERS-CoV London S gene (GenBank accession no. KC164505) were produced as previously described (27).
