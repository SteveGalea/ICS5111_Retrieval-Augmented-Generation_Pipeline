{"summary": "a major bottleneck in the development of new and effective vaccines is the delivery of antigens to dendritic cells (DCs) (5, 6), which sample the antigen, transport immunogenic components to secondary lymphoid organs, and initiate and maintain T and B cell responses. off-the-shelf vaccines that permit targeted delivery of antigens to DCs in vivo have become a major focus in vaccine development. antigen coupling to antibodies is a major limitation for induction of CD8+ T cell responses which are strictly dependent on cross-presentation (5, 17) viral vectors encoding immunogenic antigens can deliver their genetic cargo directly into DCs, thus generating antigenic peptides in infected cells. major impediments of these vectors are frequent off-target transduction resulting in antigen presentation by parenchymal cells outside secondary lymphoid organs. coronavirus genomes with sizes 27 to 31 kb represent the largest autonomously replicating RNAs known to date. the unique transcription process generates 6 to 8 subgenomic mRNAs encoding the four canonical structural proteins and various numbers of accessory proteins. the unique transcription process generates 6 to 8 subgenomic mRNAs encoding the four canonical structural proteins. mice lacking B cells (JHT mice), CD4+ T cells (I-Ab/ mice) or T and B cells (RAG/ mice) were infected i.v. with 106 PFU MHV-GP. body weight was determined at the indicated time points (B), and levels of alanine transferase (ALT) were determined on days 5 and 15 postinfection (C) B6 mice were immunized i.v. with 106 PFU MHV-GP or MHV-GM/GP or were left untreated (nave) cells were harvested 12 h later and stained for the indicated surface molecules. MHV\u2013Mel-A, or 105 PFU MHV-GM/Mel-A in the indicated combinations. percentage of tetramer-binding CD8+ T cells was determined on day 7 postimmunization (4 mice per group) Cytotoxicity was calculated as the ratio of gp34-coated cells to the percentage of uncoated cells in immunized mice normalized for the ratio of gp34-coated to uncoated cells in naive mice. values in the histograms indicate percentages of killing activity after 24 h posttransfer (3 mice) tif."}
