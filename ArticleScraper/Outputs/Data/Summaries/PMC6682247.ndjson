{"summary": "in acute settings, the pericardium does not have time to increase its compliance, leading to a rapid decline in cardiac output. acute presentations of tamponade can occur within minutes or hours, as is typically seen in trauma, aortic rupture, or iatrogenic result from an invasive procedure. study showed 27\u201343% of patients presenting with subacute cardiac tamponade are actually hypertensive. findings may include tachycardia, jugular venous distension, pulsus paradoxus, tachypnea, hypotension, hypertension, and pericardial rub. tamponade is mostly a clinical diagnosis, but echocardiography is highly recommended by multiple task forces and societies. vital signs included a blood pressure of 129/96 mmHg, heart rate 99 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation 100% on room air. a formal transthoracic echocardiogram was performed, which showed normal systolic function with an ejection fraction of 50\u201355% and no evidence of a pericardial effusion. corona virus, metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus types 1,3, and 4, cytomegalovirus, human immunodeficiency virus, coxsackie, influenza A, myocoplasma pneumoniae, buccal virus, and rhinovirus were also negative. a patient developed severe, life-threatening cardiac tamponade in under 24 hours that necessitate immediate intervention. atraumatic cardiac tamponade developed over the span of 24 hours in a young female with a history of pericardial effusion. echocardiography has a class I recommendation to evaluate most pericardial diseases. this imaging modality can estimate the size and location of the effusion. the patient tested negative for the most common etiologies of tamponade. Upon discharge, a repeat echocardiogram demonstrated no evidence of re-accumulation of a pericardial effusion. this patient was successfully treated by surgical pericardiectomy to remove pericardial fluid. no significant pericardial effusion is seen. download video file (1MB, mp4) Video 2.
