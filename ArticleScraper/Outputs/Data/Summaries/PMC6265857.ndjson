{"summary": "the 2015 outbreak of MERS-CoV posed a serious public health threat in the Republic of Korea. it generated 186 confirmed cases including 38 fatal cases. it has been claimed to be a super-spreading event (SSE) similar to the SARS outbreaks in 2003. this shows significant heterogeneity in the 2015 MERS-CoV transmission. five super-spreaders (3%) infected 79% (147/186) of the total MERS-CoV cases. Figure 2. Transmission trees are displayed (only infection tracing) the node size is proportional to the number of secondary cases. the standard compartmental models have been used. they assumed superspreaders have a longer infectious period than normal infected individuals. a branching process model is inherently limited in capturing heterogeneity of attributes. the last way is to make the number of contacts of super-spreader larger than the number of normal agents while the infectivity remains same with normal agents. a group of studies has employed ABM in modeling SSEs from the perspective of the contact network. super-spreaders model with higher infectivity (SSM1), super-spreaders model with higher contacts (SSM2) and super-spreaders model with both higher infectivity and higher contacts (SSM3) are carried out under various epidemic scenarios. the results are compared with the real epidemic data of 2015 MERS-CoV in Korea. transmission dynamics of four model are demonstrated at t = 25 day. top four panels show the results using = 4 % and bottom four panels show the results using = 10 %. SSM 3 shows the fastest transmission pattern while No-SS shows the slowest. first super-spreader model (SSM1) assumes that super-spreaders have a higher transmission probability (or higher infectivity) than regular spreaders within the effective contact radius r 0. The second super-spreader model (SSM2) assumes that super-spreaders have more links (or a larger number of contacts) than regular spreaders. super-spreaders have both a higher transmission probability and a larger number of contacts. a susceptible agent becomes exposed with a probability defined by the transmission probability distribution. a newly infected person becomes infectious (asymptomatic) and remains in the exposed stage for a duration of time drawn from a gamma probability density function. super-spreaders are assumed to have either a higher transmission probability or larger number of contacts than regular spreaders. the transmission rate function is defined as a function of the distance between exposed (or infected) and susceptible individuals. super-spreaders have a higher transmission probability (or higher infectivity) than regular spreaders within the effective contact radius r 0.. the second super-spreader model (SSM2) assumes that super-spreaders have more links (or a larger number of contacts) than regular spreaders. the average incidence of 1000 simulations is displayed as a solid smooth curve along with one particular incidence (a dashed stochastic curve) the effect of super-spreaders makes the disease transmission faster and more severe (see SSM3 in both panels) distributions are illustrated in Figure 5, which shows the peak size, peak time, and epidemic duration using = 10 %. the peak time is earlier and the peak size is larger in SSM3 (again in order of SSM3 > SSM2 > SSM1 > No-SS). this confirms that the impact of super-spreaders is significant on the MERS-CoV transmission dynamics. higher peak size, faster peak time, and earlier epidemic durations are common features of SSE. higher peak size, faster peak time, and earlier epidemic durations are the common features of SSE, which is consistent with the results under SSM3. distributions of R 0 under four super-spreader models are shown using two different proportion of super-spreaders. it shows the impact of super-spreaders on R 0 using two values of (super-spreader proportion) on the top with = 4 % and bottom with = 10 %. the impact of the baseline transmission rate 0 is shown under four models. in all models, the peak size increases rapidly as r 0 increases. in all models, the peak size increases rapidly as r 0 increases. distributions of secondary cases under four super-spreader models are compared using = 10 %. we have fitted the distribution with a power function (a x b ) and compared the slope of each fitted function to the 2015 MERS-CoV data. a random intervention isolates individuals (20% randomly chosen; both regular and super-spreaders) from the S and E classes at t = 14 day. a targeted intervention isolates individuals (20% randomly chosen; both regular and super-spreaders) from the E and I classes at t = 14 day. the results under the three models (SSM1, SSM2 and SSM3) are displayed in Figure 12. random selection reduces the peak size proportionally, resulting in a longer epidemic duration. a targeted isolation reduces the peak size significantly at the beginning. the average incidence of 1000 simulations is displayed (a solid smooth curve) with a particular incidence (a dashed stochastic curve) the effect of super-spreaders makes the disease transmission faster and more severe (see SSM3 in both panels) super-spreaders in SSM3 have a stronger transmission and longer effective radius than the other models. 4 % Peak time M = 59.57 M = 51.34 M = 41.26 M = 21.0 = 18.71 = 14.77 = 12.41 Peak size M = 24.42 M = 27.99 M = 36.66 M = 46.12 = 7.83 = 9.49 = 11.50 = 14.06 Epidemic duration M = 118.28 M = 103.73 M = 85.02 M = 73.24 = 33.12 = 31.55 = 25.17 = 21.21 = 10 we compute the basic reproduction number from a randomly chosen infected individual in a completely susceptible population. we obtain the distributions of 1000 simulations of secondary cases. Figure 6 shows the distributions of R 0 in the absence of super-spreaders. distributions of R 0 under four models are shown using two different proportion of super-spreaders. 3.3. Further Sensitivity Analysis The impact of three epidemic parameters is determined through incidence curves. first, the effect of the baseline transmission rate ( 0 ) on incidence has been investigated in Figure 8. -spreaders is varied and the incidence profiles were compared. as the proportion of super-spreaders gets larger, the peak size becomes larger and the peak time earlier in SSM2 and SSM3 while it does not have a remarkable impact in SSM1. a longer effective radius makes the disease spread easier. SSM3 shows the highest level of heterogeneity while no-SS shows the least heterogeneity. we compared the slope of each fitted function to the 2015 MERS-CoV data. the right panel compares four fitted power law distributions with the MERS-CoV data. a random intervention isolates individuals (20% randomly chosen; both regular and super-spreaders) from the S and E classes at t = 14 day. a targeted intervention isolates individuals (super-spreaders only starting from t = 14 day until the end of epidemic duration) a targeted intervention is more effective in both SSM2 and SSM3. a random intervention is more effective in SSM1 and a random intervention is more effective in SSM1. this results suggest that the effectiveness of interventions depends on the characteristics of the MERS-CoV transmission dynamics. super-spreaders showed the highest heterogeneity in distributions of R 0 and secondary cases while no-SS gave the least heterogeneity. results suggest that a small number of infectious individuals can infect others by means of a larger amount of contact with others combined with higher infectivity. a targeted isolation reduced incidence proportionally while a random isolation reduced the peak size and delayed the peak time. super-spreading events in the transmission dynamics of 2015 MERS-CoV showed a high level of heterogeneity. super-spreading events in the transmission dynamics of 2015 MERS-CoV showed a high level of heterogeneity."}
