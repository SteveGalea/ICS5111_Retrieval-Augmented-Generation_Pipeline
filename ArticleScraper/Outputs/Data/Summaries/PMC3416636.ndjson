{"summary": "phytoplankton consists of a group of genetically diverse microorganisms that contribute more than 46% of global net primary production (9) in marine ecosystems, phytoplankton produces organic carbon for the entire food web but also controls pathways of carbon flow via the formation of dominant species. molecular markers were proposed as powerful indicators to detect the physiological status of phytoplankton. housekeeping genes are widely used as biomass references when quantifying mRNA levels of genes under study (3, 13) these housekeeping genes are typically involved in basic cellular processes with a constitutive expression at mRNA levels that fluctuate minimally. the same approach is applicable to natural samples, as long as the primers for the target and reference genes show good specificity to the species of interest. a reliable internal control in natural environments requires more than a minimal diel variation. a reliable internal control in natural environments requires more than a minimal diel variation. a reliable internal control in natural environments requires more than a minimal diel variation. lassiosira weissflogii was provided by E.

PCR products were purified from a low-melting-point agarose gel and cloned into pGEM-T vectors. itative PCRs were initiated by adding the cDNA into a mixture containing 1 SYBR green PCR master mix. primer sets targeting 18S rRNA, TBP, EFL, and FcpB were specifically designed for S. costatum and C. affinis. PCR settings were 95\u00b0C for 10 min followed by 40 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 15 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min. costatum ATTATGCGGCTGC TBP S. costatum CaEFLQF Reverse CAGAATTGTGGGTGCTCTTCG TBP S. costatum CaEFLQF Forward GGTCAGACCCGTCAGCACG EFL C. affinis CaEFLQF Reverse AGGCATCATCTTGTTGATTCC EFL C. affinis CaFcpBQF Forward CGTAGAGATCAAGCACGGACG FcpB C. the absolute amount of target gene RNA (X) normalized to a unit of reference gene RNA (R) was calculated according to the absolute ratio method described in reference 4: log ( X 0 R 0 ) = log ( M R M X ) + C T,X b X C T,R b R 2 (2) where Var(CT,X) and Var(CT,R) are CT variances of X and R. the fold variation of tube replicates was calculated as 10 raised to the power of Std log ( X 0 / R 0 ) from equation 2. the specificity of the Q-RT-PCR products was confirmed by a melting-temperature analysis performed on the 7500 Real-Time PCR system (Applied Biosystems) from 65 to 95\u00b0C for 20 min and examined by electrophoresis on 3% agarose gels containing 0.5 Tris-boric acid-EDTA buffer Q-PCR was performed using cDNA obtained from environmental samples. results of the Q-PCR were reported using both the absolute quantification method and the absolute ratio method. c Copy ratio = 2CT, where CT is the average CT over a series of genomic DNA dilutions. d St. 9 = 121.9\u00b0E, 25.5\u00b0N. nucleotide sequence accession numbers. gene expression range of a death marker gene (ScDSP) and a nitrogen deficiency marker gene (TpNrt2.1) errors represent 1 standard deviation of replicate cell counts, Fv/Fm tube replicates, or Q-RT-PCR tube replicates. error bar is smaller than the symbol. a variation of 1.59-fold during the 24-h period was almost as small as the variation of Q-RT-PCR tube replicates at 1.37-fold. with 18S rRNA as the normalization standard, EFL mRNA in S. costatum was about 25 times that in C. affinis. transcript levels normalized to 18S rRNA in S. costatum and C. affinis. error bars indicate 1 standard deviation of Q-RT-PCR tube replicates. data points without an error bar mean the error bar was smaller than the symbol. diatom TBP amino acid sequences were 83%, and the identity between diatom and nondiatom groups was 65%. other sequences also formed distinct clades, but their phylogenetic associations were unclear. numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values based on 1,000 resamplings. group-specific primers designed for Skeletonema spp. also performed well with strong amplification in S. costatum. some minor (10%) amplification appeared in T. pseudonana and Thalassionema sp. Skeletonema group-specific EFL and FcpB transcript abundances were determined in environmental samples, using Q-RT-PCR. the range of variation was between 104 and 105 copies (g total RNA)1. values of maximum photochemical efficiency of PSII (Fv/Fm) began to decline on day 4. data points without an error bar indicate the night period from sunset on 18 August to sunrise on 19 August 2009. in h/2 medium during the experimental period, transcript levels of EFL were stable at 207 mol (mol 18S rRNA)1 with a day-to-day variation of 1.47-fold on a linear scale. in low-nutrient media, EFL mRNA began to increase from a basal level on day 3 and stabilized at a higher level at 1,767 mol (mol 18S rRNA)1 on days 5 to 8. mRNA in S. costatum was about 25 times that in C. affinis. FcpB was used to test the performance of 18S rRNA, EFL, and TBP as reference genes. data points without an error bar indicate 1 standard deviation of Q-RT-PCR tube replicates. 32 gene fragments homologous to diatom EFL genes were obtained from genomic DNA extracted from ECS samples. the deduced amino acid sequences of these fragments were aligned with known algal EFL peptides. sequences formed distinct clades, but their phylogenetic associations were unclear. numbers at the nodes are bootstrap values based on 1,000 resamplings. GenBank accession numbers are shown in parentheses. cross-reactivity test of group-specific primers using genomic DNA from 8 cultivated diatoms. amplification efficiencies of these primer sets were evaluated using serially diluted genomic DNA extracted from C. affinis and S. costatum. group-specific EFL and FcpB transcript abundances were determined in environmental samples using Q-RT-PCR. the range of variation was between 104 and 105 copies (g total RNA)1. the range of variation was between 104 and 105 copies (g total RNA)1. both genes should be good references for normalizing gene expression in culture studies. compared, TBP expression possessed a 1.33-fold variation during the light-dark cycle and a day-to-day variation of 1.60-fold. but group-specific primers for TBP did not perform well for natural phytoplankton. apparent detection of 10% was obtained from T. pseudonana as well. this is not surprising, since Skeletonema is phylogenetically close to several species belonging to the genus Thalassiosira (1). the FcpB-to-EFL DNA copy ratios were around 28 for the laboratory culture and 18 for the ECS sample. these gene ratios were close to the expected ratio of around 30 in the complete genome of T. pseudonana (16, 38), which indicated that the specificities of EFL and FcpB primer sets were approximately equal for Skeletonema. in addition, diel variations in Skeletonema FcpB expression were 0.02 to 16.6 mol (mol E a better interpretation of measured mRNA levels can be achieved by conducting induction/inhibition experiments on deck to obtain the relative position of the in situ sample."}
