{"summary": "microglia play key roles in maintaining CNS homeostasis and acting as first responders to infection and inflammation. peripheral macrophages infiltrate the CNS during neuroinflammation. studies comparing gene profiles of microglia and macrophages have revealed valuable microglial-specific genes. differential expression of cell surface-specific genes during neuroinflammation can potentially be used to discriminate between microglia and macrophages. electronic supplementary material The online version of this article contains supplementary material."}
