{"summary": "polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN) are the most abundant class of white blood cells. astrocytes are the most abundant glial cell population. they participate in the local innate immune response triggered by a variety of insults. astrocytes could increase Akt, Erk1/2, and p38 activation in neutrophils. the complex actions of astrocytes on neutrophils could provide further insight to harness the inflammatory response to promote CNS repair. neutrophils' anti-infectious action in host defense can also mediate tissue damages. the inflammation response is a complex process and includes production of host-derived anti-inflammatory mediators. microglia could interact and engulf invading neutrophils, hence providing protection for the CNS. experimental animals C57/B6 mice were purchased from Charles River. the hematopoietic cells were obtained by flushing the bone marrow cavity using a 26-gauge needle. cortices were dissected out in a 10 cm Petri dish containing 5 ml of phenol red-free DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 100 g/ml penicillin and streptomycin. then cortices were centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 5 min and supernatant was aspirated. tissues were spun down and supernatants were aspirated. fresh supplemented DMEM was added immediately before co-culture. cells were vigorously washed with PBS to remove stimuli. cells were seeded into astrocyte-containing tissue culture plates at a ratio of 1:1 (PMNs: astrocytes) astrocytes were labeled with 5 M 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. the cells were resuspended in DMEM at a density of 5 105/ml. neutrophils were added into each well to mix with astrocytes. CFSE fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Infinite M200 microplate reader. FITC-labeled E. coli were prepared by the method described previously. bacterial suspension was incubated at room temperature in darkness for 2 hr. washed three times in veronal buffered saline (pH 8.6) containing 0.1 M sodium diethyl barbiturate, 0.15 mM CaCl2, 1 mM MgSO4, 0.1% gelatin. opsonized in mouse serum for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. l of RNA solution was mixed with 0.5 l of random primer (Promega) and 0.5 ul of RNAse inhibitor (Invitrogen) the mixture was then heated for 3 min at 70\u00b0C and placed on ice. following reagents were added to the mixture to get a total reaction volume of 20 l: 4 l of 5 reaction buffer (USB), 2 l of 0.1 M DTT, 2 l of 10 mM dNTP Mix western blot PMNs were isolated with Dynabeads and were co-cultured with astrocytes at a ratio of 3:1 for indicated periods. Neutrophils were then collected in cold PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) microscopy showed few astrocytes in the cell suspension after isolation. ophils, ROS production of neutrophils, MPO releasing and real time PCR data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. a post hoc Tukey's test was performed to identify a specific difference between groups. experimental animals C57/B6 mice were purchased from Charles River. cortices were dissected out in a 10 cm Petri dish containing 5 ml of phenol red-free DMEM (GIBCO) supplemented with 100 g/ml penicillin and streptomycin. then cortices were centrifuged at 2200 rpm for 5 min and supernatant was aspirated. tissues were spun down and supernatants were aspirated. neutrophils were seeded into astrocyte-containing tissue culture plates at a ratio of 1:1 (PMNs: astrocytes) for control, neutrophils were seeded in fresh DMEM without astrocyte. after co-culture, all cells were collected and subjected for further sorting or analysis. astrocytes were labeled with 5 M 5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate, succinimidyl ester (CFSE, Invitrogen) for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. astrocytes were incubated in the presence or absence of 25 g/ml poly I:C for 24 hr. one hundred l of neutrophils were added into each well to mix with astrocytes. CFSE fluorescence was measured using a Tecan Infinite M200 microplate reader. CFSE fluorescence was measured using a BDTM LSRII flow cytometer. the bacteria were washed three times with PBS and resuspended in RPMI 1640 at a concentration of 2.5 109/ml. cells with bacteria were incubated for 15 min at 37\u00b0C. 10 l of RNA solution was mixed with 0.5 l of random primer (Promega) and 0.5 ul of RNAse inhibitor (Invitrogen) the mixture was then heated for 3 min at 70\u00b0C and placed on ice. following reagents were added to the mixture to get a total reaction volume of 20 l: 4 l of 5 reaction buffer (USB), 2 l of 0.1 M DTT, 2 l of 10 mM dNTP Western Blot PMNs were isolated with Dynabeads and were co-cultured with astrocytes at a ratio of 3:1 for indicated periods. Neutrophils were collected in cold PBS containing 2 mM EDTA and 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) followed by isolation on a magnetic concentrator again to get rid of astrocytes. phagocytosis of neutrophils, ROS production of neutrophils, MPO releasing, and real time PCR data were analyzed by two-way ANOVA. a post hoc Tukey's test was performed to identify a specific difference between groups. neutrophils were labeled with CFSE and added to cultures of confluent primary astrocytes. after 1 hour incubation, non-adherent neutrophils were washed off. CFSE intensity was detected in all co-culture groups. Neutrophils bind to astrocytes in vitro. CFSE-sorted resting or LPS-primed neutrophils labeled with CFSE. cells were fixed with methanol and immunoreacted for GFAP (red) astrocytes were gated into four groups based on their forward scatter intensity. the numbers show the percentages of astrocytes binding to neutrophils. astrocytes prolong neutrophil survival dependent on cell-cell contact. neutrophils were co-cultured with resting or poly I:C-primed astrocytes at a ratio of 1:1 for 16 hr. after co-culture, all cells were trypsinized, washed with PBS once. CD11b+ Neutrophils were then stained with Annexin V and propidium iodide. apoptosis of neutrophils was decreased by a half upon LPS stimulation. a moderate increase of necrosis (PI+) induced by LPS stimulation was detected. transwell culture of neutrophils with astrocytes without direct contact demonstrated an inhibitory action on neutrophils apoptosis. resting neutrophils were co-cultured with resting or poly I:C-primed astrocytes at a ratio of 1:1 for 6 hr. FITC-E. coli was added to the co-culture system. the increaseary effect of astrocyte in neutrophil's phagocytosis was mediated by direct astrocyte-PMN contact. no change was found between co-culture and transwell culture of astrocytes and neutrophils. white bar, neutrophils alone; grey bar, neutrophils co-cultured with resting astrocytes; black bar, neutrophils co-cultured with primed astrocytes. h2DCFDA intensity was then determined with a microplate reader (A) or flow cytometry analysis (C) astrocytes down-regulate neutrophils degranulation Enzymes released from pre-formed granules in neutrophils play a critical role in neutrophil-mediated pathogens homicidal action as well as tissue liquefaction. astrocytes profoundly reduced MPO production from both resting and activated neutrophils. grey bar, neutrophils alone; black bar, neutrophils co-cultured with resting astrocytes; black bar, neutrophils co-cultured with primed astrocytes. black bar, neutrophils co-cultured with resting astrocytes; black bar, neutrophils co-cultured with resting astrocytes. kines expression were mediated through both cell-cell contact-dependent and independent mechanisms. astrocytes regulate pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in neutrophils. neutrophils were cultured in separated compartments in a transwell system. co-culture with astrocytes also increased phosphorylated p38 level in neutrophils. this suggests the involvement of p38 MAPK pathway in regulatory action of astrocytes on neutrophils. neutrophils appeared to be loosely attached to the plastic surface. a substantial increase of granular particles was found in neutrophils. the highest CFSE intensity was observed in co-cultures of primed astrocytes. neutrophils may bind to astrocytes through ligand-receptor engagement in a time-dependent manner. astrocytes were fixed and stained with GFAP antibody. both binding were enhanced by astrocytes activation. cells were fixed with methanol and immunoreacted for GFAP (red) followed by fluorescent microscopy. CFSE+ astrocytes were gated into four groups based on their forward scatter intensity. astrocytes were pre-activated with LPS or fMLP for 2 hours. resting neutrophils terminate their life through apoptosis, not necrosis. astrocytes could effectively inhibit neutrophils apoptosis in an activation-independent manner. astrocytes could either weakly accelerate the transition of neutrophils from early apoptosis to late apoptosis, or slightly promote neutrophils necrosis. resting neutrophils were cultured alone or cultured with astrocytes in the same (co-culture) or separate compartment (transwell) of a transwell plate for detection of apoptosis and necrosis. astrocytes could significantly enhance neutrophils. the inhibitory action of astrocytes on neutrophils apoptosis was independent of cell-cell binding. the inhibition of necrosis was cell-cell binding-dependent. astrocytes could induce neutrophils necrosis potentially through releasing soluble factors. FITC-E. coli was added to the co-culture system. all cells were trypsinized and washed with PBS once. no change was found between co-culture and transwell culture. astrocytes triggered weak and insignificant decrease of basal ROS production. in resting neutrophils, both resting and primed astrocytes down-regulated intracellular H2DCFDA intensity close to baseline. primed neutrophils and primed astrocytes were cultured in separate compartments in transwell plates. a robust up-regulation of fluorescence intensity was observed when primed neutrophils and primed astrocytes were cultured. astrocytes may release soluble mediators to enhance neutrophils respiratory burst. tes profoundly reduced MPO production from resting and activated neutrophils. astrocyte-conditioned media elicited similar inhibitory actions on neutrophils degranulation. astrocytes inhibit MPO release from neutrophils. ing or LPS-activated neutrophils were incubated in the presence or absence of equal volume of astrocyte-conditioned medium followed by semi-quantification of MPO release. astrocytes regulate cytokine expression in neutrophils. isolated resting neutrophils were co-cultured with astrocytes and cell lysates were prepared for Western blots of Akt/PKB, Erk1/2 and p38. co-culture with astrocytes induced up-regulation of both Akt and phosphorylated Akt levels compared with basal levels in freshly isolated 30-min cultured neutrophils. neutrophils are the first leukocyte subtype recruited to the brain. astrocytes outnumber neurons by approximately ten-fold and have critical roles in CNS homeostasis. astrocytes are involved in the neuroinflammatory process by secreting various cytokines. our current study provides the first evidence that astrocytes can differentially regulate neutrophil functions. astrocytes may influence neutrophil functions through both soluble mediators and cellular contact. cell adhesion assay confirmed direct binding of neutrophils to astrocytes. astrocytes may regulate neutrophil survival in two distinct ways. soluble factor(s) may induce neutrophil necrosis while cellular contact inhibits both necrosis and apoptosis. fate of neutrophils might depend on their distance from astrocytes. astrocytes can enhance pro-inflammatory cytokine expression in neutrophils. phagocytosis could limit replication of viruses or bacteria under infectious condition. astrocytes produce numerous cytokines following phagocytosis. production in neutrophils was reduced by astrocytes, indicating an inhibitory action of astrocytes on neutrophil respiratory bursts. this inhibition of ROS production could lessen brain damage, therefore benefitting brain recovery. astrocyte-induced ROS reduction may intertwine with signal transduction pathways to regulate neutrophil behaviors. our study demonstrates that both PI3-K and MAPK pathways in neutrophils are activated when they are co-cultured with astrocytes. however, given the different cell-cell contact-dependent and -independent actions of astrocytes on neutrophils, we predicted that astrocytes might modulate cell signaling pathways in neutrophils differently.
