{"summary": "between January 2005 and December 2009, only 17 of the 657 osteonecrosis patients under our care were diagnosed with MFON (2.6%) between January 2010 and June 2015, only 48 of the 1507 osteonecrosis patients under our care were diagnosed with MFON (3.1%) upon admission. among the 48 patients diagnosed with MFON between 2010 and 2015, 31 were male and 17 were female. MFON patients most commonly had osteonecrosis of the femoral head, followed by the knee, shoulder and ankle bones. the majority of patients had bilateral lesions (hips, knees and shoulders) osteonecrosis joint involvement 2010\u20132015 (17)* 2005\u20132009 (17)* Post-SARS patients (37)* Hip 155 (99%) 33 (100%) 72 (98%) Knee 129 (82%) 30 (88%) 58 (78%) Shoulder 106 (67%) 10 (29%) 33 (44%) Ankle 54 (34%) 0 22 (9%) in france, Hernigou4 reported on 140 MFON cases diagnosed between 1985 and 1995, all of which were associated with corticosteroid use. in the cases reported by Mont et al.1, 91% had a history of corticosteroid use, and the rest had a coagulation disorder. the total dose and the daily dose of venous injection were closely related to the occurrence of MFON. MFON patients most commonly had osteonecrosis of the femoral head, followed by the knee, shoulder and ankle bones. 98\u2013100% had femoral head involvement, 78\u201388% had knee involvement, and 29\u201367% had humeral head involvement. the average number of osteonecrotic lesions was 5.7 per patient. radionuclide scans have a higher sensitivity in detecting advanced stage osteonecrosis of the hip and knee than of the shoulder and ankle. the diagnosis of osteonecrosis by MRI has its advantages, but the screening for MFON with MRI is faced with a long scanning time and high cost. treatment of MFON MFON patients usually starts with silent lesions. patients may only experience increased pain during movement or weight bearing on the affected bone or joint. patients often have symptoms at rest and reduced joint activity, resulting in severe joint dysfunction. the incidence of MFON was high when clinical risk factors were present, such as high-dose steroid use, alcohol abuse, chronic nephropathy and leukemia. a radiological screening of multiple joints is necessary, and MRI is still the gold standard for diagnosing MFON. 81 patients had MFON of the 2484 patients diagnosed with osteonecrosis. in 2003, we screened post-SARS medical workers with corticosteroid use. between 2005 and 2009, only 17 patients had MFON of the 657 patients admitted to our center. a study by Hernigou4 showed that the total dose and the daily dose of venous injection were closely related to the occurrence of MFON. this was also found in our study of post-SARS osteonecrosis patients caused by the use of corticosteroids3. the exact incidence of MFON in patients with various diseases remains unclear. 98\u2013100% of MFON patients had femoral head involvement, 78\u201388% had knee involvement and 29\u201367% had humeral head involvement. low field MRI was as sensitive as a radionuclide scan in diagnosing osteonecrosis. the majority of osteonecrosis cases reported in the literature are bilateral. patients with associated diseases and long-term use of corticosteroids should have their hips and knees evaluated by MRI within six to twelve months after the medication. osteonecrosis of the femoral head progresses the fastest and attention should be paid to the early appearance of symptoms. the progression of osteonecrosis to the elbow and wrist is relatively slow; however, we still lack experience regarding the appropriate treatment method for this area. a radiological screening of multiple joints is necessary, and MRI is still the gold standard for diagnosing MFON. the goals of the treatment should be to take measures to delay the progress of the disease, to preserve the joint function and to avoid joint surface collapse and destruction. arthroplasty should be performed during the advanced stages. the corticosteroid dose was approximately 2000 mg in unifocal osteonecrosis patients except for one patient who received 2000 mg. the MFON patients also had prolonged corticosteroid treatment (30 days)3 of the 17 MFON patients diagnosed between January 2005 and December 2009, one had a 30-year history of alcohol abuse. steroid use or alcohol abuse were found to have osteonecrosis of one or more joints in the shoulder, ankle, wrist and elbow. MRI was performed on their hips and knees and their other joints when necessary."}
