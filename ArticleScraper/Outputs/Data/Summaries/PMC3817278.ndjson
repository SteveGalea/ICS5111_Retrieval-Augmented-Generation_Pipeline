{"summary": "e.g. HIV, hepatitis viruses, and influenza viruses constitute a large proportion of morbidity and mortality each year. outbreaks with previously undescribed viruses occur regularly (e.g. SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and MERS-CoV) [1]\u2013[4]. respiratory tract infections and diarrhoea in young children or immunocompromised persons often test negative for known viruses. a technique was developed that uses convalescent serum of the patient to concentrate viruses that have elicited and immune response prior to sequencing. a single nasopharyngeal specimen was obtained at the Academic Medical Center from a patient with an upper respiratory tract infection. antibody capture Respiratory and fecal samples were centrifuged (10,000 g) and 150 l of the supernatant was mixed with 50l Dynabeads protein A and G (11, Invitrogen) after 20 minutes incubation, 10 l of autologous convalescent serum of the patient was added to the mixture. antibody-antigen complexes were lysed with Boom-lysis buffer L6. the lysate was used as input for Boom extraction. samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000 g. s with different Multiplex Identifier sequences (MIDs) were ligated to the digested fragments. the purified DNA was quantified with the Quant-it dsDNA HS Qubit kit (Invitrogen) and diluted to 107 ng/l. the sequences reads are submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive. the enrichment index was calculated by dividing the percentage of viral sequences in the captured sample by the percentage viral sequences in the input sample. a value above 1 indicates antibody capture of the virus, which suggests a immunogenic course of infection. the ratio between these percentages is calculated and all fragments with a ratio higher than 1.0 were extracted and further analyzed. a single nasopharyngeal specimen was obtained from a patient with an upper respiratory tract infection. antibody capture Respiratory and fecal samples were centrifuged (10,000 g) and 150 l of the supernatant was mixed with 50l Dynabeads protein A and G (11, Invitrogen) after 20 minutes incubation, 10 l of autologous convalescent serum of the patient was added to the mixture. sate was used as input for Boom extraction [14] followed by VIDISCA-454 sequencing. samples were centrifuged for 10 minutes at 10,000 g. rRNA-blocking oligonucleotides were added to prevent amplification of ribosomal RNA. the purified DNA was quantified with the Quant-it dsDNA HS Qubit kit (Invitrogen) and diluted to 107 ng/l. samples were pooled and Kapa PCR (Kapa Biosystems) was performed to determine the quantity of amplifiable DNA in each pool. the enrichment index was calculated by dividing the percentage of viral sequences in the captured sample by the percentage viral sequences in the input sample. a value above 1 indicates antibody capture of the virus, which suggests a immunogenic course of infection. the ratio between these percentages is calculated and all fragments with a ratio higher than 1.0 were extracted and further analyzed. a total of 110,752 reads were obtained from the input material and 93,779 reads were obtained from the antibody captured material. patient ID Virus % viral reads in input % viral reads in capture Enrichment indexa Patient 1 PIV-1 0.26% 0.38% 1.5 Patient 2 PIV-2 0.07% 3.6% 54 Patient 3 PIV-4 0.78% 15% 19 Patient 4 HRV 42% 77% 1.9 Patient 5 hMPV 1.4% 9.9% 7.2 Patient 6 NL63 1.7% 33% 20 Patient 7 RSV 18% 29% 1.6 Patient 8 Inf B 0.61% 2.0% 3.3 Patient 9 In para-influenza viruses 1, 2 and 4 infections were detected with an enrichment index of 1.5, 54 and 19 respectively. the enrichment index for the metapneumovirus was 7.2, while it was 1.6 for the respiratory syncytial virus. norovirus infection was observed in two patients and enriched 20-fold and 11-fold. viral reads appear more frequently in the antibody-captured material compared to the input. this increase can also be used to identify viruses without the necessity of sequence similarity to known viruses that can be probed by Blast. in patient 19, 62% of the EAR were derived from a hepatitis B virus. the plant virus and the enterobacteriophage were not detected in the EAR of patient 15 and 19 respectively. index was determined by calculating the ratio between the percentage of viral reads in the captured sample versus the input sample (Table 2). Reads of viruses after antibody capture. para-influenza viruses 1, 2 and 4 infections were detected with an enrichment index of 1.5, 54 and 19 respectively. the enrichment index for the metapneumovirus was 7.2, while it was 1.6 for the respiratory syncytial virus. norovirus infection was observed in two patients and enriched 20-fold and 11-fold. reads were massively present and for these patients a strong decrease (>70%) was observed in the number of bacterial reads. a strong decrease (>70%) was observed in the number of bacterial reads. in patient 19, 62% of the EAR were derived from a hepatitis B virus. the plant virus and enterobacteriophage were not detected in the EAR of patient 15 and 19 respectively. in 11 of the 13 patients, between 98% and 100% of the enriched analysis reads were of mammalian viral origin. in fecal samples between 21% and 100% viral reads were detected in the EAR in 4 out of 6 cases. patients with enterovirus infection are not hampered in their immune response to enteroviruses, and chronic shedding is as rare as in the normal population. antibody response to a virus infection can vary, depending on the virus, but also age and immune state of patients. method is an effective tool for reducing host DNA/RNA and bystander virus sequences. it provides a selection for viruses that are able to elicit an antibody response. compared reads obtained after antibody capture with reads obtained from input samples."}
