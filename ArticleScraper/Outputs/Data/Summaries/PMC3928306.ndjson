{"summary": "signal intensity changes in the vertebral endplate and subchondral bone marrow on magnetic resonance imaging, also known as Modic changes (MCs) are often observed in patients with degenerative spinal diseases. type I changes are hypointense on T1WI and isointense or hyperintense on T2WI and represent subchondral bone sclerosis. the use of reference genes can correct biases caused by variations in RNA input, or reverse transcription efficiency, or amplification efficiency. an ideal reference gene is presumed to be expressed at a constant level in all tissues and cells and under different experimental conditions. patients with MCs at the operated segment were recruited into the MC group. those without MCs formed the control group. 12 MC and 12 non-MC samples, age- and sex-matched, were used. primer pairs were designed using Primer 3 ver. 0.4.0 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/primer3/) and then checked for the absence of stable hairpins and dimers using Oligo 5.0 (Molecular Biology Insights, Cascade, CO). all primers were designed to be close to the 3\u2032 end of the RNA sequence, and to be located on different exons to avoid genomic DNA contamination. tctgta SDHA Succinate dehydrogenasecomplex, subunit A NM_004168.2 agacctaagcacctgaagacg 175 99.7 atcaatccgcaccttgtagtct B2M Beta-2-microglobulin NM_004048.2 atccatccgacattgttg 150 98.5 ggcaggcatactcatcttt ttc 18S 18S ribosomal RNA NR_003286.2 cagccacccgagattgagca 253 96.9 tagtagcgacgggggtgtg Quantitative real-time PCR qRT-PCR was performed using the GoTaq\u00ae qPCR Master Mix kit (Promega) each reaction was performed in 20 l containing 2 l cDNA, 10 l Gotaq Master Mix, geNorm and NormFinder analyzed data by transforming raw Ct values into relative quantities using the Ct method. the lowest Ct value was subtracted from the raw Ct values of qRT-PCR for each gene to give the Ct value. total RNA was extracted using Trizol (Invitrogen) and further purified with an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) the concentration and purity of the isolated RNA were estimated in triplicate using a nanoDrop 2000 spectrophotometer. the integrity of RNA samples was confirmed by electrophoresis on 2% Sybr Green agarose gel (Invitrogen) the primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (Shanghai, China) the primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd (shanghai, China) 97.8 ggttactgcccttgacagagat LDHA Lactate dehydrogenase A NM_005566.3 gcctgtagcctttgaa 157 100.6 ccaggatgtgtagccttgaa 157 100.6 ccaggatgtgtagccttgag HMBS Hydroxymethylbilane synthase NM_000190.3 gaa a melting analysis was performed by heating the amplicon from 60\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C. a reverse transcriptase negative control was included to ensure the absence of genomic DNA contamination. for each primer pair, a series of 10-fold of three dilutions of cDNA were made to generate a standard curve. no non-specific amplicons or primer dimers were detected in the no-template control. the absence of signals in the reverse transcriptase negative control suggested no genomic DNA contamination. expression levels of these 12 reference genes varied widely with Ct values ranging from 17.6 (18S rRNA) to 33.5 cycles. HA, TBP, GUSB, ACTB, HPRT1, 18S rRNA, and RPL13A were the most stable genes for MC types I, II, and III respectively. SDHA and LDHA, SDHA and TBP, and SDHA and LDHA were the most stable genes for MC types I, II, and III. NormFinder is a model-based algorithm, which identifies the most stable reference genes. the most stable reference gene in all samples was LDHA, with a M value of 0.102, followed by SDHA, B2M, GUSB, GAPDH, IPO8, HMBS, ACTB, TBP, 18S rRNA, HPRT1 and RPL13A.

SDHA was the most stable single gene in all samples, and SDHA, B2M, and LDHA comprise the optimal reference gene set. a simulated expression analysis was performed using data from samples with MC types I and III. SDHA and LDHA consistently turned out to be the most stable genes, and RPL13A the most unstable. the simulation was conducted taking LDHA as target and SDHA and RPL13A as reference genes. no non-specific amplicons or primer dimers were detected in the no-template control. the absence of signals in the reverse transcriptase negative control suggested no genomic DNA contamination. expression levels of these 12 reference genes varied widely with Ct values ranging from 17.6 (18S rRNA) to 33.5 cycles. HMBS, ACTB, HPRT1, 18S rRNA, and RPL13A were the most stable genes for MC types I, II, and III respectively. SDHA and LDHA, SDHA and TBP, and SDHA and LDHA were the most stable genes for MC types I, II, and III. a lower M value indicates more stable expression. NormFinder is a model-based algorithm, which identifies the most stable reference genes based on combing samples into groups. the most stable reference gene in all samples was LDHA, with a M value of 0.102 followed by SDHA, B2M, GUSB, GAPDH, IPO8, HMBS, ACTB, TBP, 18S rRNA, HPRT1 and RPL13A.

LDHA was also top-ranked for those with MC types I and III. LDHA was also top-ranked for those with MC types I and III. B2M was the most stable for those with MC type II. gene expression variation is determined by the calculated standard deviation (SD) and coefficient of variance (CV) for all candidate reference genes based on the whole data set of their Ct values [22]. Those with the lowest CVSD were identified as the most stable genes. SDHA and ACTB had the smallest CV SD of 2.6140.776 and 2.7570.884, respectively. a method taking into account all the three sets of results was applied to calculate the final ranking of candidate reference genes. the geometric means of the three ranking numbers produced by geNorm, NormFinder, and BestKeeper were calculated for each candidate reference gene. SDHA, B2M, and LDHA comprised the optimal reference gene set.

IPO8, which was one of the most stably-expressed genes in samples with MC type I, was not ranked so high. our results only apply directly to vertebral cartilage endplate with MCs. it is unclear how well our results could be extended to other regions of vertebral cartilage endplate, i.e., the cervical and thoracic regions."}
