{"summary": "decision-analysis model was constructed using DATA 4.0 (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA, USA) the model was designed to identify the most effective and cost-effective uses of societal resources in managing FRIs of undetermined origin during a SARS outbreak. negative SARS (RT-PCR) test results combined with a positive test for another respiratory pathogen will result in the discontinuation of SARS isolation precautions. a future SARS outbreak would be managed by using existing healthcare infrastructure. ization for FRI $5,000 $11,645 $15,000 14 Hospitalization for influenza $7,500 $17,465 $25,000 14 Hospitalization for PUI $20,000 $28,502 $40,000 14,15 Diagnostic tests Rapid influenza test $15.00 $26.86 $40.00 16 Multiplex RT-PCR $50.00 $154.02 $200.00 Prodesse Inc., pers. comm. 95 20\u201322 Specificity of multiplex RT-PCR 0.80 0.987 0.99 20\u201322 Sensitivity of SARS RT-PCR 0.25 0.70 0.95 4,23 Morbidity and mortality Hospitalization due to influenza 0.002 0.004 0.01 25 Death due to influenza 0.0 0.0012 0.01 25,26 Hospitalization due to FRI 0.010 0.015 0.02 Calculated Death due to SARS 0.10 0.15 0.20 24 Miscellaneous probabilities Probability of an F Detects influenza viruses A and B, respiratory syncytial viruses A and B, parainfluenza viruses 1\u20133, human metapneumovirus, Legionella pneumophila, L. micdadei, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and Bordetella pertussis. the proportion of FRIs due to influenza was estimated assuming a SARS outbreak of similar size and duration to the Toronto outbreak. the proportion of FRIs due to influenza was derived from 2 large observational studies conducted over multiple respiratory seasons. the proportion of FRIs due to the common respiratory pathogen panel listed above was estimated from the medical literature (29,30) the effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was derived from the medical literature (19\u201324), while the positive predictive value of each diagnostic test was calculated by incorporating the estimated prevalence of specific pathogens into the equation. the average seasonal effectiveness of the influenza vaccine was adjusted by assuming that the vaccine would be poorly matched to circulating influenza strains approximately twice every 10 years. RT-PCR assays are not sufficiently sensitive to rule out SARS (2). we assumed that persons with FRIs seeking medical care might receive antimicrobial drugs. we estimated this probability by using data from the national Ambulatory Medical Care Survey. transportation costs to see a medical provider were derived by using U.S. national data. the base cost of an ambulatory care visit was estimated by using the national average 2000 Medicare reimbursement rates for a focused medical evaluation. the cost of the rapid influenza test was derived from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (16). decision-analysis model was constructed using DATA 4.0 (TreeAge Software, Williamstown, MA, USA) the model is premised on a SARS outbreak during respiratory season. the outbreak was designed to be consistent in size and duration with the Toronto outbreak (5). a third complementary strategy entailing mass influenza vaccination among the general population before the onset of respiratory season was considered. a plausible range of high and low values for each variable were used to conduct sensitivity analyses. a plausible range of high and low values for each variable were used to conduct sensitivity analyses.
