{"summary": "biomarkers are expressed at the surface of human cells or infectious pathogens such as viruses, bacteria, fungi or parasites. the composition and dynamics of the cell surface determine how a cell or a pathogen can interact with its environment. membrane proteins are currently the target for more than half of the approved drugs. antibodies have been identified against only 364 CD antigens. aptamers are generated by a molecular directed evolution approach from a library of 1014-1015 oligonucleotides. this technique is usually called SELEX (Systematic Evolution of Ligands by EXponential enrichment) sequences which do not bind the target are removed by different partitioning methods. sequences are eluted (ex: urea, EDTA, competition with a ligand) and amplified by PCR. the selected pool can enter a new round of selection. aptamers recognize the three-dimensional structure of their targets with high specificity. a pool of nuclease-stabilized 2\u2032-aminopyrimidine RNA library was selected at 4 and 22 \u00b0C against a human chimera immobilized on Protein A-Sepharose beads. the same group performed the same SELEX at higher selection temperatures (either 22 or 37 \u00b0C) in order to be potentially usable in vivo. the first six rounds were performed against biotinylated CD4 captured on beads coated with streptavidin. another six rounds were performed against CD4 captured onto beads coated with a monoclonal anti-CD4 antibody. aptamers selected against a purified ectodomain of a membrane protein may also be able to recognize the protein in its native environment. 15 Membrane filtration/gel shift assay Yes [23] 2\u2032F-Py RNA CTLA-4 9 Membrane filtration Yes [24] RNA RANK 7 Affinity chromatography ND [25] DNA RGD/fibonectine 5 + 5 Affinity chromatography Yes [26] Modified DNA Sialyllactose 13 Affinity chromatography ND [14] RNA TLR3 7 Membrane filtration ND [27 first anti-carbohydrate aptamer was selected against sialyl Lewis X (sLeX) the selected aptamers had a high affinity (KD around 109 to 1011 M) for their target and for similar sugars such as lactose. the selected aptamers showed a 100 times lower affinity for unrelated sugars such as lactose. the selection of aptamers has been performed against the ectodomain of proteins immobilized on a support (magnetic beads, plastic plate or SPR biosensor) the production and purification of a membrane protein ectodomain is often much easier than it is for the whole protein. however, in some cases, aptamers identified using this strategy was unable to bind their target in its native form and environment on the cell surface. the first SELEX against such a complex mixture of targets was performed using human red blood cell (RBC) ghosts. the first SELEX against such a complex mixture was performed using human red blood cell (RBC) ghosts. bound aptamers were eluted using a ligand of the receptor. this strategy also resulted in aptamers that were potent competitors of the natural ligands of the receptors. the plasma membrane is a dynamic system composed of membrane constituents that are in close contact with each other. aptamers were predominantly selected against the glycoprotein B and H, which represent the most abundant and exposed envelope proteins of the virus. aptamers were predominantly selected against whole living systems.

Tuberculosis BCG ND 10 [88] DNA L. Acidophilus No S-layer protein 8 the library was counter-selected against rat YPEN-1 endothelial cells. unbound sequences were removed by centrifugation. the pool was fluorescently labeled during the SELEX. this allowed the monitoring of enrichment of cell-binding aptamers. aptamers have been selected with ability to distinguish cells on the basis of differentiation state [60], distinguish cancer cells or virus infected cells from normal cells of the same origin [61,65] for such aptamers, target identification can lead to the identification or validation of cell specific biomarkers. the strategy has been named AptaBiD for Aptamer-facilated biomarker Discovery [66] to isolate high affinity aptamers, a counter-selection step was applied in round seven of the SELEX experiment. we selected aptamers against transfected PC12 cells over-expressing the human mutated receptor tyrosine kinase RET (RETC634Y), which is constitutively activated in its dimeric form. cross-over strategies have been developed to select aptamers against the toll-like receptor 2 [82] cross-over SELEX In comparison to SELEX against purified targets, the selection of aptamers is more difficult to direct towards specific proteins. in the latter case the membrane proteins are in an environment more close to the native situation. the pool was loaded on a P2X2-IAM column for chromatographic selection of RNA molecules with binding affinity to the receptor. one round of IAM chromatography SELEX was able to improve the affinity of the pool to the receptor by 300%. aptamers are incubated with cells at different concentrations and bound aptamer quantified after extensive washing. aptamers are incubated with cells at different concentrations and bound aptamer quantified after extensive washing. aptamers can be incubated with cells at different concentrations and bound aptamer quantified. many studies apply fluorescent aptamers to perform similar analyses by flow cytometry. the technique can also be used with adherent cells, but cells have to be put in suspension before flow cytometry analysis. however, the presence of some proteins on plasma membranes may be affected by the procedures associated with detachment of adhering cells. aptamers targeting cell surface proteins have been successfully used as targeting moieties to deliver contrast agents, nanoparticles encapsulating drugs or siRNA to specific tissues in vivo. aptamers targeting cell surface proteins have been successfully used as targeting moieties to deliver contrast agents, nanoparticles encapsulating drugs, or siRNA to specific tissues in vivo."}
