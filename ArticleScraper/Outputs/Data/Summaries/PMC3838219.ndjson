{"summary": "two members of the genus Henipavirus are Hendra virus (HeV) and Nipah virus (NiV) both viruses can cause severe encephalitis in humans. natural reservoir hosts for henipaviruses are flying foxes of the genus Pteropus (4, 5) all F proteins contained a carboxy-terminal hemagglutinin (HA) tag and all G proteins a carboxy-terminal FLAG tag. the expression efficiencies and fluorescence intensities of the expressed glycoproteins in permeabilized cells were similar for M74 and NiV. proteolytic activation of the NiV fusion protein requires recycling from the plasma membrane through an endosomal compartment in an acid-dependent process. ammonium chloride prevents acidification of endosomal compartments and inhibits syncytium formation induced by NiV F protein (12). transfected cells expressing M74 F, NiV F, or no foreign protein (ctr) were incubated in the presence (+) or absence of NH4Cl. at 24 h p.t., the cells were monitored for syncytium formation. rin B2/Fc was confirmed using anti-human IgG-HRP. both G proteins were precipitated in an ephrin B2-dependent manner. the FLAG-tagged G proteins of NiV and M74 were expressed in BHK-21 cells. the presence of ephrin B2 was shown by immunostaining. our results show that Asian and African henipaviruses share some characteristics suggesting a similar strategy of virus entry. this cell line may also be helpful in the isolation of infectious henipaviruses from African fruit bats and maybe even from other geographic regions."}
