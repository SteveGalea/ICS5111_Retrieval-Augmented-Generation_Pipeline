{"summary": "CF is an autosomal recessive inherited disorder caused by mutations within the CFTR gene [2], leading to increased morbidity at a young age. reduced ion transport significantly dehydrates the airway mucus leading to reduced ASL preventing adequate removal of mucus via the mucociliary escalator. CFTR plays an important role in the secretion of pancreatic proenzymes (e.g., zymogen) into the duodenum and poor endocrine function. CF can also affect the hepatobiliary system. only 3.9% of children and 5.4% of adults with CF suffer from liver disease. CF mice fail to develop spontaneous lung disease or chronic bacterial infections. CF mice express a CFTR-independent alternative Cl channel. CFTR-deficient mice still secrete Cl, thereby compensating for dysfunctional CFTR. CF mouse, pig, and ferret models have enhanced our knowledge of CF pathology. this review was carried out using the MEDLINE database, Google Scholar, and The Cochrane Library databases using appropriate generic terms. CFTR also controls potassium (K+) transport by regulating the renal outer medullar potassium channel (ROMK2) over 2000 CFTR mutations have been identified to date. mutations account for 39.71% of all CFTR mutations, frameshift mutations account for 15.66%, splicing mutations account for 11.45%, and nonsense mutations account for 8.28% of CFTR mutations worldwide. the resultant truncated CFTR is degraded within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and does not reach the cell surface. class II mutations block CFTR processing, where misfolded protein is degraded in the ER. class IV mutations alter the CFTR conductance of Cl. class VI mutations lead to reduced synthesis of functional CFTR. accelerated protein turnover may reduce CFTR half-life at the cell surface. it is currently the third most common long-term long-term treatment for CF patients with 46% of children and 50% of adults with CF prescribed rhDNase in 2013. maintaining good nutritional status is important for patients with CF to maximise clinical outcomes. transplantation may be considered as the next intervention. reports emerge of potential indirect benefits of ivacaftor as an anti-inflammatory. ivacaftor is an approved investigational corrector aimed at targeting the defective F508 mutation. lumacaftor/ivacaftor approach was approved to treat homozygote patients. this was a major breakthrough for CF patients. the minimal positive clinical outcomes will no doubt improve the quality of life of patients. mutants carrying the Class III G551D mutation (CFTRtm1G551D) have been reported. however, intramutant variations in survival, disease severity, and pathology of these animals have been reported. CFTRtm1HSC Exon 1 replacement Mutant mRNA 53% of WT CFTR levels Absent or mild (nonlethal) intestinal complications [59] CFTR: cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator; WT: wild type. the channel, in concert with CFTR-mediated Cl secretion, plays an important role in the proper regulation of ASL volume. CFTR mouse model developed spontaneous lung inflammation without challenge. no lower airway epithelial abnormalities were reported for knockout models. lack of severe spontaneous lung pathology in these mouse models has been partly attributed to the expression of a non-CFTR calcium-activated Cl channel (CACC) in certain mouse tissues. low ATP12A proton-pump expression levels in CF mice may allow for normal ASL pH and unimpaired airway host defences. findings may explain why CF mice exhibit increased protection from pulmonary infection. -ENaC mouse model demonstrated critical importance of the -subunit for optimal ENaC activity. most models mirror the pathology reported for CFTRtm1UNC and CFTRtm1BAY. CFTRtm1EUR and CFTRtm2HGU models display intestinal abnormalities. mice do not suffer the same lethal intestinal obstruction observed in humans or in knockout mice. null knockout models such as CFTRtm1UNC and CFTRtm1CAM reported to have only mild to moderate pathological changes to the pancreas. CFTRtm2CAM, CFTRtm1EUR, CFTRtm1KTH, and CFTRtm1G551D lack any pancreatic abnormalities at all. the lack of observed corollary between mouse models and humans is speculated to again involve the expression of the alternative Cl channel in murine seminal vesicles and epididymides. some females with CF are also affected by infertility, but studies are far less numerous. a similar read-through compound, NB124, was shown to suppress nonsense mutations and partly restore CFTR function in a G542X transgenic mouse model [82] a similar read-through compound, NB124, was shown to suppress nonsense mutations. other drugs and gene therapy approaches have been described in murine models. no lower airway epithelial abnormalities were reported for knockout models including CFTRtm1UNC, CFTRtm1CAM, CFTRtm1BAY, and CFTRtm1HGU. lack of severe spontaneous lung pathology in these mouse models has been partly attributed to the expression of a non-CFTR calcium-activated Cl channel (CACC) in certain mouse tissues. ATP12A proton-pump expression levels in CF mice may allow for normal ASL pH and unimpaired airway host defences. excessive ENaC activity, specifically an overexpression of the -subunit of ENaC (-ENaC), accelerated Na+ absorption and induced a CF-like pulmonary clinical phenotype. CFTRtm1UNC and CFTRtm1BAY models display intestinal abnormalities. CFTRtm1EUR and CFTRtm2HGU models display mild intestinal phenotype. mice do not suffer the same lethal intestinal obstruction observed in humans. CFTRtm2CAM, CFTRtm1EUR, CFTRtm1KTH, and CFTRtm1G551D were reported to have only mild to moderate pathological changes to the pancreas. the significant disparity between the severe CF pancreatic phenotype observed in humans and the milder presentation in mice may be explained by very low levels of residual CFTR activity. the lack of observed corollary between mouse models and humans is speculated to again involve the expression of the alternative Cl channel in murine seminal vesicles and epididymides. the lack of observed corollary between mouse models and humans is speculated to again involve the expression of the aforementioned alternative Cl channel in murine seminal vesicles and epididymides. a similar read-through compound, NB124, was shown to suppress nonsense mutations. a similar read-through compound, NB124, was shown to suppress nonsense mutations. a similar read-through compound, NB124, was shown to suppress nonsense mutations and partly restore CFTR function. CF piglets also require pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy, vitamins and H2 blockers, and/or proton-pump inhibitors to improve gastric acid control [87, 89]. CF piglets mimic the cycle of infection and inflammation of humans. c-AMP-stimulated Cl transport was impaired in nasal and tracheal airways of CF piglets with the CFTR/ mutation [98], similar to humans with CF [99, 100] hyperabsorption of Na+ in nasal cells of CF piglets was increased when compared to WT piglets. studies have shown that 100% of CFTR/ and CFTRF508/F508 pigs develop complex MI [87, 89, 101] this is in agreement with the increased occurrence of MI in humans carrying the F508 mutation. CFTR/ piglets also had intestinal atresia, a complication that occurs at birth resulting in the narrowing of the intestine. pigs have a separate common bile and pancreas duct, allowing researchers to study bile and pancreatic fluid separately. in CFTR/ pigs, the number of acinar cells and cytoplasmic zymogen granules decreased, with increased zymogen secretions found in the interstitium. the CFTR/ pig had mild to moderate hepatic lesions [89] and elevated bile protein compared to the WT pigs [105]. CFTR/ pig had increased cellular inflammation, ductal hyperplasia, and mild fibrosis. the CFTR/ pig model presented with inflammation and exhibited common symptoms of biliary cirrhosis. the pig model of CF provided scientists with a strong platform to study this important conundrum in detail. studies using the CFTR/ pig showed similar numbers of immune cells and cytokine IL-8 concentrations in WT and CF piglets. CFTR/ and CFTRF508/F508 pig models resemble similar lung pathological outcomes. simple MI is failure to remove the meconium within the first 48 hours of birth. complex MI represents intestinal atresia, necrosis, and perforation. the GI pathologies of CFTR/ and CFTRF508/F508 are similar, indicating a CFTR-related defect affecting pathological outcomes in piglets. CFTR/ piglets fail to gain weight, not dissimilar to human counterparts. the CFTR is located on the apical membrane of cholangiocytes. congealed bile and mucus have been found in smaller gallbladders of CFTR/ and CFTRF508/F508 pigs compared to the WT pigs. CFTR pharmacologic and bioelectric functionality in ferret epithelia is similar to that of human epithelia. ferret's short gestation period and time to reach adolescence within 4\u20136 months along with its smaller size may make it a more cost-effective model to maintain. CFTR+/ breeding pairs for the production of CFTR-deficient ferrets. CFTR/ ferrets show greater morbidity after 48 h as they fail to thrive. of approximately 25% of newborn kits that survive MI, none thrive or live longer than 4 days. the ferret intestinal tract demonstrates a more severe form of MI compared to humans, mice, and pigs. CFTR/ ferrets showed a similar pathology to that observed in ferret neonates. CFTR/ ferrets showed reduced bile acid absorption by the GI tract, causing poor fat absorption leading to reduced nutritional status. mortality still occurs within 5\u20139 days. CFTR/ ferrets show greater morbidity after 48 h as they fail to thrive. half of CFTR/ ferret kits succumb to intestinal lesions of the colon or ileum. of approximately 25% of newborn kits that survive MI, none thrive or live longer than 4 days. CFTR+/ ferret kits showed low levels of cholesterol and high levels of plasma alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and bilirubin. no liver lesions were found in CFTR/ ferrets. CFTR/ ferrets poor nutritional condition results from poor absorption of nutrients which is corrected by supplementation of ursodeoxycholic acid. there are many advantages to the use of mice to study the pathology of CF disease. but there are also a number of limitations to their use. phenotypic variations exist between models and the degree of severity of such manifestations also differ greatly. a lack of CFTR protein and function in CFTR/ piglets impacts on the lungs, liver, pancreas, and GI tract. this burden may limit the usefulness of the porcine model in some institutions. the potential risks involved in surgery and complications associated with MI, including intestinal atresia, demand great understanding and commitment to the use of these animals.
