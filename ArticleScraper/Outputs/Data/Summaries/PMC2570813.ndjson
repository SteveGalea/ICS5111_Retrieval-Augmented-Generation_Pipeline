{"summary": "the study real-time PCR assays for APM were developed from multiple primers and probes designed for conserved regions of class I NCLDV genes L396 and R596, class III NCLDV gene L65. all probes were labeled at the 5\u2032 end with 6-carboxy-fluorescein and quenched at the 3\u2032 end with black Hole Quencher-1 (Biosearch Technologies, Novato, CA, USA) PCR products were purified using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) and then cloned into a pCR-II TOPO vector by using a TOPO TA Cloning Kit. recombinant plasmids were then isolated by using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (QIAGEN) standard curves were prepared from serial 10-fold dilutions of the quantified plasmid in nuclease-free water containing 100 g/mL of herring sperm DNA. the real-time PCR assays could detect as few as 10 copies of plasmid DNA per reaction with amplification efficiencies of 99.6% [slope \u20133.33 and r2 = 0.99]. 124 Children5 y Nasal swabs Urban USA Oct 2000\u2013 Sep 2001 None detected 120 Adults, children NP swabs Rural Thailand Sep 2003\u2013 Aug 2004 None detected Nosocomially acquired pneumonia outbreaks 23 Geriatric NP/OP swabs Retirement center, USA Jul\u2013Aug 2002 20% rhinovirus 24 Geriatric Nasal swabs Retirement center, USA May 2004 50% hMPV Community-acquired pneumonia outbreak 5 Adults, children BAL, revalence study of APM among patients with community-acquired pneumonia identified APM antibodies in 9.7% of 376 patients compared with 2.3% of 511 healthy controls (3). seropositivity may reflect exposure to APM antigen rather than active infection, and the potential for nonspecific cross-reactions with the serologic assays used may have inflated the true prevalence of APM infection (6)."}
