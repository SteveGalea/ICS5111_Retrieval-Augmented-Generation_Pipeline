{"summary": "climate change has been shown to have and to continue to have both direct and indirect effects on communicable diseases, often in combination with other drivers, such as increased global travel and trade [4,5,6] it is thought that there will still be significant impacts in Europe [9]. surveillance is the on-going collection, validation, analysis and interpretation of health and disease data needed to inform key stakeholders. the degradation of information through the surveillance hierarchy remains a challenge. detailed records are somewhat unstructured at the individual physician level and highly structured surveillance records with limited data fields. this paper describes the infectious disease surveillance systems in place in the EU, cross surveillance initiatives and environmental surveillance data that can be used to investigate environmental determinants of ID. it is important to review existing surveillance systems and the data they provide as part of a response to these future risks. information on organisations, agencies, and networks involved in infectious disease surveillance in Europe was collected from surveillance experts, peer-reviewed literature, grey literature and web sites. a number of technical experts at other international agencies, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) the methodology was predominantly descriptive and designed to identify as many of the systems as possible. metadata standards are formulated based on mandatory elements of the INSPIRE metadata standards to the requirements of E3 on one hand, and ECDC-core metadata on the other hand. a set of metadata translation and compilation tools were developed to facilitate the authoring of metadata that complies with E3 standards. data, outbreak data and field reports, vaccine and drug utilization, primary care surveillance (including sentinel systems), sickness absence data, syndromic surveillance etc. (Table 2). ECDC (established 2005) has the main goal of decreasing the incidence and prevalence of communicable disease in Europe. 178 member countries and territories report information on animal diseases using immediate notifications and bi-annual and annual reports [21]. food and agriculture organization (FAO) Launched in 1945, is the main United Nations agency for food. FAO engage in all aspects of agriculture production, fishery, food quality and food safety. EFSA examines data on zoonoses, antimicrobial resistance and food-borne outbreaks submitted by EUMS and produces EU Summary Reports [25]. EEA is responsible for monitoring the European environment and publishes a five yearly assessment report. EEA collects and analyse different types of environmental data available to EUMS in a range of data bases and data sets. surveillance information is collected through epidemic intelligence activities on a daily basis, including a 24/7 duty system. the data is collected in the Threat Tracking Tool (TTT) data base that allows ECDC to keep track of verified events with a known or possible impact on public health. the aim is to assist in the prediction, prevention and control of animal disease threats, including zoonoses, through information sharing, epidemiological analysis and joint field missions. ProMED-mail publishes and transmits information on world-wide outbreaks of infectious diseases and acute exposures to toxins that affect human health. the global public health intelligence network (GPHIN) Event based threat tracking GPHIN is a secure internet-based multilingual early-warning WHO-linked tool that continuously searches global media the rapid alert system for food and feed (RASFF) provides threat information about food and animal feed that could be a serious risk to human health. this includes case and outbreak surveillance (EpiWatch), news and events (EpiNews), an online journal (EpiNorth Journal), disease notification data (EpiNorthData), vaccination programmes (EpiVax) and educational and training (EpiTrain) the European Health for All Database (WHO-HFA-DB) International surveillance WHO data allows age- and sex-specific analysis of mortality trends by broad disease-groups. mortality data by three-digit codes of the International Classification of Diseases, disaggregated by five-year age groups, back to 1990. the European Detailed Mortality database (WHO-DMDB) international surveillance WHO data provides tools for the analysis and international comparison of morbidity and hospital activity patterns.
