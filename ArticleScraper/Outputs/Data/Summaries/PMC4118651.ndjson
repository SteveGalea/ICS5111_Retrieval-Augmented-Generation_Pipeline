{"summary": "mixed pneumonia (virus + bacteria) has been described in recent years. it is not known whether the systemic inflammatory profile is different compared to monomicrobial CAP. a bacterium as a co-pathogen of a virus can be found in association with CAP. this accounts for as much as 39% of cases in which an etiological agent is identified. it seems logical that some pneumonias considered to be viral will actually be mixed CAP [3], suggesting clearance of a past or current subclinical upper airway infection not related to a concomitant CAP. there are very few studies of mixed viral-bacterial CAP that involve biomarkers. the CAPNETZ study included a large number of patients (1337) with CAP. of which 58 (4.3%) showed mixed etiologies. this group was heterogeneous, as it included two or more typical or atypical bacteria. a sex-matched and age-matched control group was collected from subjects admitted to the orthopedic-surgery, digestive medicine, and neurology departments. none of these patients had any suspected infectious or respiratory disease in the previous two months, immunosuppression, known neoplasia, or recent trauma, and none had recently undergone surgical procedures. blood samples were collected from CAP patients and controls on admission to the ED. a sample was submitted to the hematology lab for a WBC count. another sample with EDTA was submitted to the biochemistry lab for CRP and PCT assessment. second serological tests performed on blood obtained during 30-day follow-up visit. nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained and processed for viral antigens using the direct fluorescence antibody (DFA) assay. patients with atypical-involved CAP were divided into 3 groups: bacterial, viral and mixed. patients with no microbiological findings were considered as CAP of unknown cause. patients with no microbiological findings were considered as CAP of unknown cause. coccus faecalis and 1 Staphylococcus hominis and 5 from mixed (2 S. hominis + Adenovirus, 1 S. hominis + Virus influenza A + RSV, 1 Staphylococcus coagulase-negative + metapneumovirus, and 1 Morganella morgagnii + coronavirus) we then had 174 patients with viral, bacterial and mixed pneumonia. the best model was selected by a stepwise procedure. we constructed receiver operating characteristic curves. the AUC and its 95% confidence intervals were estimated for each biomarker to predict different CAP etiologies. a sex-matched and age-matched control group was collected from subjects admitted to the orthopedic-surgery, digestive medicine, and neurology departments. none of these patients had any suspected infectious or respiratory disease in the previous two months, immunosuppression, known neoplasia, or recent trauma, and none had recently undergone surgical procedures. blood samples were collected from CAP patients and controls on admission to the ED. a sample was submitted to the hematology lab for a WBC count. another sample with EDTA was submitted to the biochemistry lab for CRP and PCT assessment. a pneumoniae (ELISA test, Savyon Diagnostics Ltd, St. Ashdod, Israel) first serum test. second serological tests were performed on blood obtained during 30-day follow-up visit. nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained and processed for viral antigens. patients with atypical-involved CAP were divided into 3 groups: bacterial, viral and mixed. patients with no microbiological findings were considered as CAP of unknown cause. patients with no microbiological findings were considered as CAP of unknown cause. enterococcus faecalis and 1 Staphylococcus hominis) and 5 from mixed (2 S. hominis + Adenovirus, 1 S. hominis + Virus influenza A + RSV, 1 Staphylococcus coagulase-negative + metapneumovirus, and 1 Morganella morgagnii + coronavirus) we then had 174 patients with viral, bacterial and mixed pneumonia. blood was drawn from CAP patients in the ED shortly after CAP diagnosis for bacterial culture. sputum was obtained when possible and before antibiotics were administered. only samples containing a preponderance of leukocytes and a few squamous epithelial cells were considered acceptable. patients with atypical-involved CAP were divided into 3 groups: bacterial, viral and mixed. patients with no microbiological findings were considered as CAP of unknown cause. patients with no microbiological findings were considered as CAP of unknown cause. 185 patients with CAP and isolation of at least 1 microorganism. we excluded 4 patients with atypical bacteria-involved CAP. we then excluded 4 patients with atypical bacteria-involved CAP. mixed vs viral;
