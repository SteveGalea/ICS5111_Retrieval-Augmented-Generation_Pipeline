{"summary": "nidovirus is a positive-strand RNA (+RNA) virus that belongs to the order Nidovirales (suborder Arnidovirineae, family Arteriviridae, subfamily Equarterivirinae, genus Alphaarterivirus), a steadily expanding clade of +RNA viruses. the order currently comprises 88 formally recognized species that are classified in 9 virus families. pp1a and pp1ab involves extensive proteolytic cleavage (into at least 13 nonstructural proteins [nsps]) most of the viral nsps and viral RNA synthesis are associated with membranous \u201creplication organelles\u201d (ROs) that typically include paired membranes and double-membrane vesicles (DMVs [7, 8; for a review, see reference 9]). sA resistance-associated mutations identified in the consensus sequence of replicates CsA-1, -2, and -3. depicted are the 5\u2032 UTR and ORF1ab, with replicase polyprotein 1ab amino acid numbers, cleavage sites, and nsp cleavage products indicated. cyclophilin inhibitor cyclosporine (CsA) inhibits the replication of a wide variety of nidoviruses. alisporivir (ALV) has been identified as a potent inhibitor of hepatitis C virus (HCV) and other RNA viruses. cytosolic CypA has been proven to be an essential host factor in the replication of, e.g., HCV, human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and west Nile virus (reviewed in reference 23) coronaviruses HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-229E (24, 25) seem to be much less affected by depletion of CypA in the infected cell. wild-type EAV (EAVwt; strain Bucyrus; multiplicity of infection [MOI], 0.005) was serially passaged in Huh7 cells in the presence of increasing concentrations of CsA (4 to 20 M) by passage 7 (P7), all three replicates grew in the presence of 20 M CsA (data not shown) treatment with 3.1 M CsA blocked the development of virus-induced CPE. treatment with 4 M CsA resulted in a 4-log reduction of viral progeny. mock-infected Huh7 cells were infected with EAV CsA-1, -2, or -3 or with lineage EAVwt P7. all experiments were repeated at least twice. rEAV nsp5Y113H 4.4 0.3 2.8 rEAV nsp10Y387H 4.6 0.3 3.0 EAV CsA-3 Passage 7 virus 10.2a 4.8 rEAV nsp2A199T 1.7 0.1 1.1 rEAV nsp5L8S 2.2 0.1 1.4 Reversion to wt nsp5-L8 rEAV nsp5Q21 titers of above 104 PFU/ml (EAV CsA-1 and CsA-3) or even around 106 PFU/ml (EAV CsA-2) were reached when infection was done with the P7 viruses from the three CsA-resistant replicates. the yields of all three replicates were equally reduced compared to that of EAVwt P7. mutations in nsp2 (A199T) and again nsp5 (L8S and Q21R) no mutations were discovered in the consensus sequence of the EAVwt P7 control. mutations identified in the CsA-1 to -3 P7 viruses potentially are linked to the established reduced sensitivity to CsA. two variants were detected: nsp5 Q21 (wild type) and R21 (mutated sequences). b The open reading frames for EAV GP4 and the ORF5a protein overlap. each mutation was individually reverse engineered into the EAV genome using full-length cDNA clone pEAN900. mutant rEAV nsp5Y113H+A134V showed a decreased sensitivity to CsA, which now approached that of the EAV CsA-1 replicate. when the Q21R mutation was added, the CsA resistance diminished slightly compared to the Y113H A134V double mutant. however, upon passingaging and resequencing, the double mutant appeared to be genetically instable. 96-well plates were infected (MOI, 0.05) with rEAVwt (control; black line) or mutants reflecting consensus sequences of CsA-1, -2, and -3. the cytotoxicity of CsA treatment only was monitored in parallel in mock-infected Huh7 cells (light gray line) rEAVwt and rEAVQYA in the absence of CsA were very similar. rEAVwt was essentially unable to replicate while rEAVQYA was able to produce infectious progeny. rEAVwt was essentially unable to replicate (Fig. 4, black dashed line) analysis of Huh7 cells (11 h p.i.) infected with either rEAVwt (B and E) or rEAVQYA (Fig. 5C) did not reveal obvious differences in DMV amounts, size, or ultrastructure. morphology and size of the DMVs in rEAVwt-infected cells were similar to the structures observed upon infection of untreated cells infected with rEAVwt. rEAVwt and rEAVQYA were mock infected (A and D) at an MOI of 5 or were mock infected (A and D) cells were fixed and processed for transmission electron microscopy. rEAVwt and rEAVQYA are very similar upon infection with rEAVwt and rEAVQYA. nsp5QYA mutations reduce the inhibitory effect of CsA on EAV RNA synthesis. for this purpose, BHK-21 cells were infected with rEAVwt or rEAVQYA. viral RNA synthesis was assayed by metabolic labeling with [3H]uridine from 6.5 to 7.5 h p.i. total intracellular RNA was isolated at 7.5 h p.i. from rEAVwt- and rEAVQYA-infected BHK-21 cells. labeled RNA products were isolated, separated in a denaturing formaldehyde agarose gel and visualized by phosphorimaging. the RNA-synthesizing activity of semipurified ROs from rEAVwt- and rEAVQYA-infected cells was analyzed using a previously developed in vitro RNA synthesis assay (11) the incorporation of [32P]CTP into viral RNA was analyzed in the presence of various CsA concentrations. in the absence of the compound, the incorporation of [32P]CTP into viral RNA was observed. a combination of mutations in EAV nsp5 and nsp2 can also be inhibited by the nonimmunosuppressive CsA analog alisporivir (ALV). previously, we reported the inhibition of coronavirus replication in cell culture by the related CsA analog alisporivir (ALV) (22) rEAV nsp2H114R + nsp5Q21R+M62T + GP2H11L 13.2 5.5 5.8 rEAVQYA + nsp2H114R 20.0a 8.7 a The EC50 is an estimated value. fold resistance of both P10 viruses relative to EAVwt was calculated relative to the rEAVwt value. nsp5 and nsp5 mutations in y113H and A134V were previously identified in replicates CsA-1 and Q21R. both mutations contained the same mutation (H114R) within the papainlike protease (PLP2) domain of nsp2. nsp5 mutants displayed reduced ALV sensitivity, but only the nsp5 mutants were less sensitive to CsA. the cytotoxicity of ALV or CsA treatment was monitored in parallel in mock-infected Huh7 cells. Graphs show the results (average and SD) of a representative experiment that was performed in quadruplicate. all experiments were repeated at least twice. rEAVwt mutants rEAV-nsp2H114R, rEAVQYA, and rEAVQYA-nsp2H114R in the presence of 0 to 50 M ALV (A) or CsA (B) cytotoxicity of ALV or CsA treatment only was monitored in parallel in mock-infected Huh7 cells. three replicates were measured in an assay that is based on (the inhibition of) EAV-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) in Huh7 cells. the viability of mock-infected CsA-treated cells dropped below 85% that of Huh7 cells not treated with CsA. after P7, EAV CsA-1 (red), CsA-2 (blue) and CsA-3 (green) were tested for CsA resistance. cytotoxicity of CsA treatment only was monitored in parallel in mock-infected Huh7 cells (light gray) 1.0 rEAV nsp5Q21R 4.4 0.2 2.9 rEAV nsp5Y113H 4.4 0.3 2.8 rEAV nsp5A134V 4.5 0.3 2.9 rEAV nsp5Y113H+A134V 9.1 0.6 5.9 Acquisition of second site reversion nsp5 Q21R or Q21H rEAV nsp5Q21R+Y113H the EC50 approached the CC50 for CsA in Huh7 cells. fold resistance was calculated relative to the rEAVwt value. we confirmed the reduced CsA sensitivity of CsA-1 to -3 P7 virus by infecting (MOI, 0.01) cells in the presence of 4 M CsA. Y113H mutation in nsp5 was also encoded by the ORF1a consensus sequence of the EAV CsA-2 population. no mutations were discovered in the consensus sequence of the EAVwt P7 control. mutations identified in the CsA-1 to -3 P7 viruses potentially are linked to the established reduced sensitivity to CsA. EAV CsA-3 P7 A199T (GCUACU) L8S (UUGUCG) Q21R (CAACGA) ALV-treated replicates EAVwt P10 EAV ALV-1 P10 nt 45 (AG) H114R (CACCGC) Y113H (UACCAC) A134V (TATCTGTC)b EAV ALV-2 P10 nt 47 (UC) T39N (ACCAAC) H114R (C mutant rEAV nsp5Y113H+A134V showed a decreased sensitivity to CsA, which now approached that of the EAV CsA-1 replicate. however, upon passingaging and resequencing, the double mutant appeared to be genetically instable, which may also explain the mixed sequence found at nsp5 codon 21 in the CsA-1 consensus sequence. sp10 do not contribute substantially to the level of CsA resistance of CsA-2. nsp5L8S, but not nsp2A199T, yielded a 2-fold further decrease in CsA sensitivity. the nsp2A199T mutation does not contribute to CsA resistance. p5Q21R+Y113H+A134V was selected for follow-up experiments. it was genetically stable for at least two additional passages. the single nsp5 mutation (Y113H) was key to the CsA resistance of replicate CsA-2. rEAVwt replicates in the presence of 4 M CsA. neither CsA treatment nor nsp5 mutations affect the morphology of EAV-induced replication organelles. it was previously reported that Cyp inhibitor treatment affects the morphology of the \u201cmembranous web\u201d that is formed upon HCV infection. it was striking that the EAV mutations that promote CsA resistance all map to the nsp5 transmembrane protein. adaptive mutations in nsp5 do not affect the morphology of virus-induced double membrane vesicles. Huh7 cells were infected with rEAVwt (B and E) or rEAVQYA (C and F) at an MOI of 5 or were mock infected (A and D) rEAVwt yields of rEAVwt and rEAVQYA (MOI, 0.01) were almost 4-log reduced in the knockout cells. despite reduced CsA sensitivity, replication continued to depend on presence of CypA. rEAVwt yields were determined by plaque assay (averages and SD [n = 3]) rEAVwt RNA synthesis was completely blocked, while rEAVQYA RNA synthesis was hardly affected. rEAVwt RNA synthesis is impaired but less sensitive to CsA. rEAVwt- or rEAVQYA-infected cells were metabolically labeled. intracellular RNA was isolated at 7.5 h p.i. from rEAVwt- and rEAVQYA-infected BHK-21 cells. the RNA was visualized by hybridization to a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. the positions of the genomic RNA (RNA1) and subgenomic mRNAs 2 to 7 are indicated on the left side of the gel. intracellular RNA from rEAVwt- and rEAVQYA-infected BHK-21 cells was subjected to a hybridization analysis using a 32P-labeled probe. resistance to the nonimmunosuppressive CsA analog alisporivir requires a combination of mutations in EAV nsp5 and nsp2. rEAV nsp2H114R 4.6 0.1 2.0 rEAV nsp5A134V 4.3 0.1 1.9 rEAV nsp2H114R + nsp5A134V 8.9 0.3 3.9 rEAV nsp2H114R + nsp5A134V + GP4Y151C 9.7 0.5 4.2 EAV ALV-2 Passage 10 virus 12.7a 2.8 rE sensitivity to ALV was reduced 7.4- and 2.8-fold for EAV replicates ALV-1 and -2, respectively. mutations in the 5\u2032 UTR, in ORF1a (nsp1 region) and in the structural protein-coding region. nsp5 and nsp5 mutants showed reduced ALV sensitivity. vir was passaged at increasing ALV concentrations, ranging from 4 M during passage 1 (P1) to 75 M during P10. cytotoxicity of CsA treatment was monitored in parallel in mock-infected Huh7 cells. all experiments were repeated at least twice. nsp2H114R was transferred to the rEAVQYA triple mutant already carrying the nsp5 mutations identified in our studies into CsA resistance. the rEAVQYA virus was marginally resistant to ALV. the addition of nsp2H114R rendered the rEAVQYA virus nearly insensitive to ALV treatment, while also retaining its reduced CsA sensitivity. substitutions in nsp5 and nsp2 enable EAV to tolerate CsA or ALV concentrations that would normally block virus replication. the largest EC50 increase, about 5-fold, was achieved when multiple substitutions in nsp5 (and nsp2) were combined. in infected cells, nsp5 is mainly present within a number of long-lived processing intermediates of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins (31, 32) nsp5 is mainly present within a number of long-lived processing intermediates of the pp1a and pp1ab replicase polyproteins (31, 32), in particular nsp5-7 and nsp3-8 but also larger intermediates all other three nsp5 mutations are present in predicted transmembrane domains. they may not be directly involved in interactions of nsp5 with Cyps or other proteins. this residue is also part of a potential CypA binding motif (GPxL, as identified in reference 33) in 293T cells or EAV-infected cells could not confirm an interaction between nsp5 and CypA, even when using mild conditions for cell lysis and immunoprecipitation. this could be due to technical reasons, e.g., the interaction being very weak or short-lived, but an alternative explanation may be that the interaction of CypA with the EAV RTC is not directly via nsp5 or that it depends on factors that were lacking in our assays several reports have been published that show that CsA induces the unfolded protein response (UPR) and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress (41, 42) severe dilation of ER membranes was observed in CsA-treated Huh7 cells (compare, for example, mock-infected cells in Fig. 5A and D) the same mutations in combination with the nsp2 H114R substitution contribute to ALV resistance. future studies should aim to elucidate the difference between the modes of action of ALV and CsA and the exact role of nsp5 and nsp2 in arterivirus sensitivity. two independent ALV-resistant replicates (EAV ALV-1 and ALV-2) were obtained. virus was also passaged in the absence of CsA or ALV (EAVwt) to screen for adaptive mutations unrelated to drug treatment. the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) and the compound-specific toxicity (50% cytotoxic concentration [CC50] were calculated with GraphPad Prism 6 software. to isolate viral RNA, Huh7 cells (10-cm2 dish) were infected with wild-type (wt) EAV, EAVwt P7, EAV CsA replicates. in vitro-transcribed RNA derived from wt or mutant pEAN900 was electroporated into BHK-21 cells using Amaxa nucleofector technology (Lonza) the presence of the engineered mutations was confirmed by performing one additional virus passage and sequencing RT-PCR products. membrane-associated EAV RTCs were isolated from BHK-21 cells. in vitro RNA synthesis assays (IVRAs) were performed essentially as described previously (11) at 5.5 h p.i., DMEM containing 8% FCS, 5 g/ml of dactinomycin was given. at 6.5 h p.i., 100 Ci of [3H]uridine was added to 300 l of culture medium. intracellular 3H-labeled RNAs were isolated (Tripure) cyclophilin inhibitors CsA (Sigma) and alisporivir (Novartis and Debiopharm, Switzerland) were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) or ethanol. both drugs were stored at 20\u00b0C as a 20 mM stock in aliquots. 100 l of 1.5 concentrated compound dilution and 50 l of EAV inoculum were added to each well. the final compound concentrations in the medium that were tested ranged from 0.4 to 50 M. differences in cell viability due to virus-induced cytopathic effect (CPE) or compound-specific side effects were monitored in parallel in plates containing mock-infected cells. the complete EAV genome was amplified as seven PCR amplicons. resistance-associated adaptive mutations were introduced into shuttle plasmids by standard site-directed PCR mutagenesis. restriction fragments containing the desired mutations were transferred to full-length EAV cDNA clone pEAN900, a derivative of pEAV030 (48). samples were stained during 1-h incubation steps, first with 1% OsO4 in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer and then with 1% uranyl acetate. sections with a thickness of 100 nm were collected on carbon-coated EM grids and poststained with lead citrate and a saturated aqueous solution of uranyl acetate. dilution buffer (control) and IVRA were performed in the presence of [-32P]CTP that was incorporated in the newly synthesized EAV RNA. assay mixtures were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 100 min and terminated by the addition of 60 l of 5% LiDS-LET-ProtK. agarose gel electrophoresis was performed using a 32P-labeled oligonucleotide probe. the gel was dried and hybridized using a 32P-labeled probe."}
