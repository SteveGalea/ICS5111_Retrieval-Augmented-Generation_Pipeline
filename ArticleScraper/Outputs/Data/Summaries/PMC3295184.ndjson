{"summary": "TEXT Astroviruses (AstVs) are small, rounded viruses (SRVs) with a peculiar starlike shape when observed by electron microscopy. the genome is composed of a plus-sense single-stranded RNA of 6.4 to 7.3 kb in size, containing 3 open reading frames (ORFs) and with a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail (13). human AstVs are regarded as the second or third most common cause dog A had been subjected to regular vaccination for major canine pathogens (CPV-2), enteric coronaviruses (CCoVs), rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus (CAV) and canine distemper (CDV) on day 2 of quarantining, dog B recovered completely from the disease. the virus from dog B was amplified with a 3\u2032 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) protocol. the virus from dog A was also sequenced from the 3\u2032 end of ORF1b to the poly(A) tail. in the full-length capsid protein (ORF2), the virus displayed 70.3 to 73.9% amino acid identity to other canine AstV strains. tV were used to optimize a specific real-time quantitative RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) the stools of dogs A and B were retested by the qRT-PCR in order to quantify the virus load. in dog A, AstV RNA was detected from daq 1 to 12, with the highest virus loads being detected between daq 1 and 1. the amino acid identity was calculated using a selection of sequences of 68 mammalian AstVs, without removing the gaps and without distance correction. the tree was calculated on the full-length amino acid capsid protein (ORF2) of the strain GI.E/Zoid/ITA/2010. the canine AstV strain ITA/2010/Zoid is indicated with a solid circle. astV species with assigned designation are indicated with the letter G followed by the roman number and a capital letter. a unique astV infected two dogs in a short time span. canine AstVs are genetically and antigenically heterogeneous, with ranges of variation similar to those defined for human GI.A AstV types 1 to 8 (14). some mink AstVs are able to invade and replicate in the central nervous system, causing disease."}
