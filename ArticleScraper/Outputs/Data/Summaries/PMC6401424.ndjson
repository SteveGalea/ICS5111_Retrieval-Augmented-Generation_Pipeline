{"summary": "tetraspanins are membrane proteins; they have four (tetra) transmembrane spans linked extracellularly by one large and one small extracellular loop. they induce positive (outward) membrane curvatures, potentially through their cone-shaped transmembrane domains. tetraspanin CD81 binds cholesterol, which incorporates into a pocket between the tetraspanin transmembrane domains. tetraspanins are composed of four transmembrane spans connected by one large extracellular loop (LEL) and one small extracellular loop (SEL), with short N- and C-terminal tails protruding into the cytosol. tetraspanin CD9 (red) links DPP4 to TMPRSS2 on the plasma membrane. proteolytically triggered MERS-S relocates its receptor binding domains. refolding of intermediates then pulls virus and cell membranes together to catalyze membrane fusion and \u201cearly\u201d entry at or near the cell surface. tetraspanins cleave MERS-S proteins, triggering inefficient, \u201clate\u201d entry in the endosomal network. tetraspanins appear to be reasonable candidates for bringing receptors and proteases together. tetraspanins condense coV entry factors into localized positions where effective spatiotemporal activation of viral fusion takes place. TEMs, while containing only 20% of all plasma membrane proteins, contained 50% to 90% of the coV receptors and proteases. individual tetraspanins are responsible for ferrying specific coV receptors into TEMs. tetraspanins were elucidated as partners for ferrying specific coV receptors into TEMs. omission of CD9 did not relocalize SARS-CoV and MHV receptors. a coV can be activated for entry at different locations along the endocytic pathway, either early (TMPR mediated) or late (cathepsin mediated) after virus endocytosis. a coV can be activated at different locations along the endocytic pathway, either early (TMPR mediated) or late (cathepsin mediated) after virus endocytosis. late entry appears to be a lower-efficiency, last-chance infection route before virus destruction in lysosomes. in vitro finding that CD9 facilitated the highly infectious early entry route suggested that CD9 and other tetraspanins might also be in vivo CoV susceptibility factors. the importance of early entry for MERS-CoV pathogenesis was further highlighted by the mutations that occur upon adaptation of this virus to the mouse lung environment. TMPR+ cell culture models may better reflect the in vivo environment of CoV entry. tetraspanins may be proviral because they coalesce host factors required to catalyze membrane fusion and infection. tetraspanins can condense virus-associated membrane proteins into complexes prior to endocytosis. tetraspanins can also condense virus-associated membrane proteins into complexes. interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are small alpha-helical proteins composed of 130 residues that inhibit virus entry processes at the level of virus-cell membrane fusion (53, 54). intriguingly, IFITMs intercalate into TEMs, disrupting tetraspanin interactions with their partner proteins (55). tetraspanins also facilitate viral assembly and egress. in the absence of CD81, virions bud from the plasma membrane but do not undergo fission to be released from the cell (15) they instead become elongated, with no fission at a membrane neck. these findings suggest that tetraspanins facilitate membrane curvatures required for membrane fission and virus release. virus-incorporated tetraspanins suppress rather than promote membrane fusion and virus entry. overexpressing tetraspanins inhibits HIV envelope-mediated membrane fusion (62\u201365), while depleting tetraspanins by use of small interfering RNAs promotes membrane fusion (63, 65). tetraspanins are known regulators of many cell-cell fusion reactions (70\u201373) their role is most striking during fertilization, which absolutely requires the tetraspanin CD9 (70) tetraspanins are known regulators of many cell-cell fusion reactions (70\u201373)"}
