{"summary": "the integrity of the airway epithelial barrier is essential for the regulation of innate immunity of the lungs. but such barrier integrity is known to be disrupted by a number of environmental stimuli. recent genome-wide association studies have uncovered a link between gene polymorphisms in several junctional proteins. antibody approved for RSV prophylaxis in high-risk infants has only moderately decreased hospital admissions due to RSV infection. cAMP is known to activate two major signaling mechanisms, one involving protein kinase A (PKA) and the other involving Epac, a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor for Rap1 small GTPase. the effects include tachycardia, lowering blood pressure, increasing risk of bleeding and interaction with gluconeogenesis. neither of these studies reported the adverse effects, which include tachycardia, lowering blood pressure, increasing risk of bleeding and interaction with gluconeogenesis. fluorescently labeled phalloidin 488 was used to visualize actin filaments. anti-rabbit and anti-mouse secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa-488 or Alexa-568 dyes were obtained from Thermo-Fisher Scientific. polarized human airway epithelial cells were infected apically with rgRSV244 (RSV derived from RSV A2 expressing the green fluorescent protein gene) only well-differentiated cell monolayers with TEER >500 x cm2 were used in these experiments.

NHBE cells formed tight junctions in the presence and absence of forskolin. forskolin is a potent inductor of cAMP production. the protective effects of forskolin on airway epithelium is associated with an increase in intracellular cAMP. 8-Bromo-cAMP and 8CPT-2Me-cAMP attenuated the RSV-induced drop in TEER of bronchial epithelial cell monolayers. the same concentrations of 8CPT-2Me-cAMP failed to prevent the RSV-induced reduction in TEER. the same concentrations of 8CPT-2Me-cAMP were known to efficiently activate Epac [40] forskolin and 8-Bromo-cAMP attenuated such RSV-induced mislocalization of claudin 1 and claudin 4 in bronchial epithelial cells. both forskolin and 8-Bromo-cAMP, but not 8CPT-2Me-cAMP, attenuated such RSV-induced mislocalization of claudin 1 and claudin 4. romo-cAMP (100 M), or 8CPT-2Me-cAMP (100 M) cells were fixed and immunolabeled for different AJ (E-cadherin, -catenin) and TJ (ZO-1, occludin) proteins. there is marked TJ and AJ disassembly in virus-infected cells treated with either forskolin or 8-Bromo-cAMP (long arrows) bronchial epithelial cell monolayers were infected with RSV A2 at an MOI of 0.5 for 24 h followed by stimulation with forskolin (20 M) for 5\u201360 minutes. forskolin treatment increased the amount of p-CREB but not total CREB in total cell lysates obtained from either control or RSV-infected epithelial cells. forskolin failed to attenuate RSV-induced AJC disassembly. epithelial cells were exposed to forskolin for 5\u201360 min. p-CREB (red) was determined by immunolabeling and confocal microscopy. bronchial epithelial monolayers were infected with RSV (MOI, 0.5) for 48 h. expression of a viral 87 bp sequence encoding the F protein decreased in epithelial cells pretreated with either forskolin or 8-Bromo-cAMP. expression of a viral 87 bp sequence encoding the F protein was quantified by real-time PCR. cells were infected with rgRSV (RSV derived from RSV A2 expressing the green fluorescent protein gene) followed by numeration of GFP-positive cells in the entire monolayer at 22 h post infection. increase in intracellular cAMP inhibits decreased RSV A2 F mRNA in epithelial cells. protective effects of forskolin on the organization of epithelial TJ and AJ were evident even when this cAMP-elevating agent was added as late as 24 h after the beginning of viral infection. forskolin exerts protective effects in epithelial monolayers being added after the beginning of the infection. cAMP attenuates disruption of the airway epithelial barrier triggered by dsRNA. one effect is attenuation of virus-induced barrier breakdown and AJC disassembly. the other effect is the inhibition of RSV F mRNA expression and viral propagation within the epithelial monolayers. the structure of the epithelial AJC was determined by immunofluorescence labeling and confocal microscopy of different TJ and AJ proteins. forskolin inhibits RSV-induced remodeling of the cortical actin cytoskeleton. cortactin appears to have accumulated at these prominent apical F-actin structures. forskolin completely prevented F-actin remodeling and cortactin translocation in RSV-infected epithelial cells. two different concentrations of forskolin (20 and 50 M) consistently attenuated the RSV-induced barrier breakdown. forskolin attenuates disruption of TJ structure and increased paracellular permeability in bronchial epithelial cells caused by RSV infection. TEER was measured at indicated time points. Tight junction protein, ZO-1 (green), was visualized by immunofluorescence labeling. the nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue) 16HBE14o- bronchial epithelial cells were infected apically with forskolin. NHBE cells formed tight junctions under air-liquid conditions. forskolin is a potent inductor of cAMP production. forskolin is a powerful inductor of cAMP production. treatment with a stable cAMP analog prevents RSV-induced barrier disruption and AJC disassembly. we asked if forskolin and cAMP-dependent stabilization of the airways epithelial barrier involve activation of its major effector molecule, Epac. 8-Bromo-cAMP (50 and 100 M) consistently attenuated the RSV-induced drop in TEER of bronchial epithelial cell monolayers. cell exposure to 8CPT-2Me-cAMP failed to attenuate RSV-induced

level attenuates polyI:C induced disruption of the airway epithelial barrier. confluent airway epithelial cell monolayers were treated for 24 h with polyI:C (5 g/ml) control epithelial cells demonstrated assembly of the prominent circumferential F-actin belt at the level of the AJC. cortactin weakly labeled this belt and demonstrated additional apical labeling. forskolin completely prevented F-actin remodeling and cortactin translocation. a previously unanticipated pharmacologic approach to stabilize the airway epithelial barrier and limit RSV infection in vitro. this approach involves either applying a pharmacological adenylyl cyclase activator, forskolin, or by using a stable cell-permeable analog of cAMP. this approach involves increasing intracellular cAMP level by either applying a pharmacological adenylyl cyclase activator, cAMP inhibition blocked forskolin-induced ser133 phosphorylation of CREB. cAMP inhibition by H89 reversed stabilizing effects of forskolin on apical junctions in bronchial cell monolayers. cAMP is a family of transcription factors that regulate a wide array of genes. reorganization of actin likely involves altered dynamics (polymerization and depolymerization) of actin filaments. cortactin is a ubiquitously expressed actin-binding protein that mediates F-actin dynamics by promoting filament polymerization [60\u201362] one scenario involves direct PKA-dependent phosphorylation of different actin-binding proteins. another involves indirect effects of PKA on actin filament dynamics by modulating the activity of small GTPases. the pathophysiologic implications of cAMP/PKA signaling are not well understood. an increase in cAMP level inhibits expression of RSV F protein and viral propagation in the airway epithelial cell monolayers. the degree of viral load plays a critical role in disease severity [77\u201379], while others report viral load did not correlate with RSV disease severity. cAMP is a potent modulator of viral infections in different tissues and organs. this study provides compelling evidence of cAMP/PKA-mediated protection against RSV-induced disruption of the model airway epithelial barrier. this study provides compelling evidence of cAMP/PKA-mediated protection against RSV-induced disruption of the model airway epithelial barrier. the cAMP signaling pathway is involved in the regulation of
