{"summary": "coVs are spherical enveloped particles about 100\u2013120 nm in diameter with a capped, polyadenylated single-stranded, positive-sense genomic RNA 27.6 to 31 kb in length. at the 5\u2032 end of each gene, all CoVs have a common intergenic sequence of about 7 bases which is essential for the formation of subgenomic RNAs. the names in the bars indicate the protein encoded by the corresponding ORF. the structural proteins are marked by various letters, while the nonstructural proteins are represented by unfilled boxes. arrow (b) indicates the accessory gene, ORF 3, unique to CCoV type 1. the nucleocapsid protein N is a basic phosphoprotein of 50\u201360 kDa. N is a basic phosphoprotein of 50\u201360 kDa that binds to virion RNA. the protein interacts with M protein leading to the formation of virus particles. the functions of such genes are in most cases unknown. onavirus (BCoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), sialodacryoadenitis virus (SDAV) found in rats, porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), human coronaviruses (HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1), human enteric coronavirus (HECV-4408), and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) omic revision to the ICTV Executive Committee of the Coronaviridae and the organization of the still-to-be-established subfamily Coronavirinae are based on rooted phylogeny and pairwise comparisons. the CSG has formulated a taxonomic proposal to the ICTV Executive Committee to convert phylogroups 1 through 3 into genera designated Alpha-, Beta- and Gammacoronavirus. CCoV has evolved since its first isolation in 1971. in 2001, multiple nt substitutions accumulating over a fragment of the M gene were observed. these CCoVs are dissimilar from the 1971-like CCoVs. they show an evident genetic drift toward FCoVs type 2. ination takes place is unknown, but it is known that CCoV is able to use the feline aminopeptidase (fAPN) glycoprotein as a cellular receptor. recombination events have developed in a host other than cat or dog, such as a wild carnivore, or that a wild carnivore might have harbored the immediate ancestor of CCoV. the new strain Elmo/02 was designated as the prototype of the newly recognised genotype 1 (CCoV type 1) and the reference strains were designated as CCoV type 2 [33] the high divergence in the amino acid composition and the loss and gain of potential glycosylation sites strongly suggest that the Elmo/02 strain is antigenically poorly correlated to the other coronaviruses of carnivores. phylogenetic tree was generated by the neighbour-joining method in the mega3 program [51]. scale bar indicates amino acid substitutions. enteric CCoVs are responsible for enteritis in dogs, and signs of infections may vary from mild to moderate, but they are more severe in young pups or in combination with other pathogens. CCoVs can also enhance the severity of a sequential CPV2 infection. infected dogs may shed virus for as long as 6 months after clinical signs have ceased. recent biomolecular analysis of faecal samples collected from infected dogs in Italy revealed that CCoVs infection is widespread. CCoVs type 1 and type 2 were found to be common in an Australian animal shelter with CCoV type 1 being prevalent. a novel CCoV, strain UWSMN-1, from a fatal case of gastroenteritis in pups from breeding colonies was reported in australia in 2001 [23] the isolate is divergent from CCoV and FCoV classical strains. in comparing the 751 nts in the 3\u2032 region of the S gene, it was found that the isolate had 21 unique sites and that there were 112 sites where the strain was different. the highest identity was obtained against TGEV strain Purdue. the virulent CCoV was found to fall by phylogeny. nonstructural protein 3b (22 amino acids) was shorter than expected. new CCoV strains were strictly related to TGEV in the N-terminal domain of the spike protein, whereas the rest of the genome revealed a higher genetic relatedness to CCoV type 2 isolates. the relevant antigenic differences observed between reference CCoV type 2 and recombinant TGEV-like CCoVs could have implications for prophylaxis programs, as dogs administered classical CCoV vaccines may be susceptible to infection caused by the recomb CRCoV has been found to be present in dogs in other European countries. the evolution of the betacoronaviruses is closely linked. it has been suggested that these viruses share a recent common ancestor. CCoV type 2 grows on several cell lines of canine and feline origin. identification of an isolate requires neutralization of the cytopathic effects. failure to isolate CCoV type 1 reduces the changes of identifying many forms of enteritis caused by this virus. the fluorogenic dye system consists of quantifying CCoV RNA amounts in fecal samples with a high degree of reproducibility and precision compared to quantitative gel-based PCR assays. the assay showed high specificity, sensitivity, and reproducibility, allowing a precise quantitation of CCoVs RNA over a linear range of about eight orders of magnitude, from 101 to 108 copies of standard RNA. the high frequency of RNA recombination in CoVs is probably the result of the unique mechanism of coronavirus synthesis. the viral polymerase associated with incomplete nascent RNAs dissociates from its template at a random point. it switches to a homologous site on a different RNA template to complete RNA synthesis by a copy-choice mechanism. coV has a large deletion in the N-terminus (more than 200 amino acids) that may explain the change in the pathobiology of the virus. the existence of a 29-nt deletion sequence in the genome of a wild mammal confirms the adaptation of this new virus to humans."}
