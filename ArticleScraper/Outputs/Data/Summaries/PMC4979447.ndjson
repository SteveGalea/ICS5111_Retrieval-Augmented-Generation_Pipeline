{"summary": "more than 200 viruses have been associated with bats. almost all are RNA viruses probably owing to their great ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions through a higher genetic variability. scientists called 'vampire' a bat that fed on blood, giving rise to the myth of human vampires that could transform into bats. in the eighteenth century scientists called 'vampire' a bat that fed on blood, giving rise to the myth of human vampires that sucked blood from other men and could transform into bats. et rutilis conlucere ignibus aedes falsaque saevarum simulacra ululare ferarum, fumida iamdudum latitant per tecta sorores diversaeque locis ignes ac lumina vitant, dumque petunt tenebras, parvos membrana per artus porrigitur tenuique includit bracchia pinn the emperor of the sorrowful kingdom stood, waist upwards, from the ice. he is nearer to a giant in size than the giants are to one of his arms. bats, however, can be involuntarily dangerous to humans. they are natural reservoir hosts and sources of infection for several microorganisms, including pathogens that can cause severe human diseases. bats are widespread in urban areas and come in close contact with both domestic animals and humans. bats are infected with more different zoonotic viruses per host. these are apparently not pathogenic for them, suggesting that they may control viral replication more efficiently than other mammals. more than 200 viruses have been associated with bats, and almost all are RNA viruses. RNA viruses with segmented genomes have the ability to modify their genome through genetic re-assortment (i.e., Orthomyxoviruses) at least 14 species of the Lyssavirus genus can be detected in bats, which are considered the ancestral hosts for these viruses. EBLV-1, with the sub-types EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b, is the most isolated type throughout Europe. spillover infections by EBLV-1 in other mammals were also observed. savirus Acute fatal encephalitis Yes Weir et al.19 Aravan virus No Banyard et al.10 Khujand virus No Banyard et al.10 Duvenhage virus Acute fatal encephalitis Yes Banyard et al.10 Shimoni bat virus No Banyard et al.10 Filoviridae Ebola virus Ebola haemorrhagic fever Yes Olival and Hayman31 Marburg virus Mar Paramyxoviridae Paramyxoviridae constitute a wide viral family that includes human and animal pathogens. several bat-borne paramyxoviruses have been recognized such as parainfluenza type 2 virus, Mapuera, Menangle and Tioman viruses. at least four species can cause mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections in humans. alphacoronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, and betacoronaviruses HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-OC43. more recently, two more additional pathogenic human-CoV were identified. the first experimental infection of bats with MERS-CoV has been described. the virus maintains the ability to replicate in the host without clinical signs of disease. dromedary camels may be the intermediate hosts and potential source of the virus for humans. a third filovirus species of the new Cuevavirus genus, named Lloviu virus, was recently detected in insectivorous bats in Spain. this is the first filovirus detected in Europe that was not imported from Africa. it causes respiratory tract infections, resulting in moderate-to-severe disease and occasionally death. bats may represent asymptomatic mammalian carriers of influenza A viruses. a wider range of mammalian hosts, including insectivorous bats, has been reported. the evolutionary history of this genus is characterized by relatively frequent cross-species transmission. at least 14 species of the Lyssavirus genus can be detected in bats. the characteristic bullet-shaped virus causes an acute, and frequently fatal, encephalitic disease. rabies was also detected in non-hematophagous bat species. four different Lyssaviruses have been isolated from bats. EBLV-1, with the sub-types EBLV-1a and EBLV-1b, is the most isolated type in the world. no human exposure to LLBV has been reported. Johnson et al.13 European Bat Lyssavirus type 1 Acute fatal encephalitis Yes McElhinney et al.14 Bokeloh Bat Lyssavirus No Freuling et al.16 West Caucasian Bat virus No Kuzmin et al.18 Lleida Bat Lyssavirus No Ar\u00e9chiga Ceballos et al.15 Australian Bat Lyssavirus Acute fatal encephalitis Yes weir systemic infections No M\u00fchldorfer51 Leptospira sp Several illnesses No M\u00fchldorfer51 Fungi H. capsulatum Pulmonary and systemic infections Unclear Santos et al.71 a Via intermediate host as indicated. horse is the intermediate host and the virus is likely transmitted via ingestion of feed, pasture or water contaminated with urine, saliva and feces of infected bats. at least four species can cause mild, self-limiting upper respiratory tract infections in humans. several CoVs have been identified in insectivorous and frugivorous bat species in various countries. clinical features of MERS-CoV are similar to SARS-CoV, although this virus has also been associated with several extrapulmonary manifestations. a third filovirus species of the new Cuevavirus genus, named Lloviu virus, was recently detected in insectivorous bats in Spain. the virus is transmitted to humans through contact with body fluids \u2013 mainly blood and feces \u2013 and dead bodies of infected bats. serological evidence of influenza A virus subtypes other than H17N10 and H18N11 were reported in africa frugivorous bats. about 30% antibody detection rate was found against avian H9 subtype known to cause infections in humans worldwide. the virus is present in different serotypes throughout the world and has been isolated from several mammals, including humans. several evidence suggest that bats may act as the natural reservoir of these viruses. two species of Bartonella \u2013 B. mayotimonensis and B. naantaliensis \u2013 were detected from both the peripheral blood of bats and in their ectoparasites. this suggests that bats might be a source of the human bacterial pathogens. Salmonella serotypes isolated from bats have similar characteristics to those found from livestock and humans. Escherichia coli strain has also been frequently isolated from bats. liensis \u2013 were detected from both the peripheral blood of bats and in their ectoparasites, suggesting that bats might be a source of the human bacterial pathogens. more recently, it has been reported the presence of closely related Bartonella genotypes in fruit bats and their associated bat flies in Madagascar. a number of studies reported that salmonella serotypes isolated from bats have similar characteristics to those found from livestock and humans. two of these serotypes, S. typhimurium and S. enteritidis, are a frequent cause of human and animal diseases. Pseudogymnoascus destructans is a psychrophilic fungus that infects the skin of bats during the winter months while they are in hibernation. it is caused by the psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungus P. destructans that infects the skin of bats during the winter months while they are in hibernation. ly exposed to bat sites have high risk of infection and can develop severe clinical forms of histoplasmosis. it is caused by the psychrophilic (cold-loving) fungus P. destructans that infects the skin of bats during the winter months while they are in hibernation. DbatVir has collected information on 5717 bat-associated animal viruses detected from 207 bat species in 77 different countries. strategy on surveillance and monitoring of disease outbreaks in bat populations needs to be further developed, in particular where bats and humans are in close contact."}
