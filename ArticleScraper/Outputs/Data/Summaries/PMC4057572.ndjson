{"summary": "c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase/stress-activated kinase (JNK/SAPK) and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) are important components of cellular signal transduction pathways. little is known about JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in enterovirus 71 (EV71)-infected immature dendritic cells. EV71 has been associated with fatal pulmonary edema, severe neurological complications, including encephalitis, meningitis, and a poliomyelitis-like syndrome. the molecular pathogenesis of EV71 infection remains obscure. iDCs are required for EV71 replication in rhabdomyosarcoma cells and SK-N-SH cells. little is known about role of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in DCs during the course of EV71 infection. antibodies against anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were obtained from ProteinTECH Group (Chicago, IL, USA) Rabbit polyclonal antibody against EV71 VP1 was purchased from Abcam (Cambridge, UK) the JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK specific inhibitor (SP600125 and SB203580) were acquired from LC Laboratories (Woburn, MA, USA) cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman coulter, CA, USA) for CD3, CD11c, CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR. one group was not infected with EV71 and used as control. another group was infected with EV71 at a MOI of 5 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. iDCs were pre-incubated for 1 h with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed and lysed with a lysis buffer. total protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit. the supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i. by centrifugation at 3, 000 g for 30 min. they measured the concentrations of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, IL-12 p70, TNF-, INF- and IFN- with milliplex magentic beads. the fluorescence data in each standard, quality control and samples were detected with the FLEXMAP3D. c-Jun, p-c-Jun and horseradish peroxidase conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG were purchased from SAB (Pearland, TX, USA) antibodies against anti-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) were obtained from ProteinTECH Group (Chicago, IL, USA) Rabbit polyclonal antibody against EV71 VP1 was purchased from abcam ( ng/mL of GM-CSF (Hainan Pharmaceutical Co., China), 50 ng/mL of IL-4 (PeproTech, NJ, USA), and antibiotics for 7 days. cells were collected and analyzed by flow cytometry (Beckman coulter, CA, USA) for CD3, CD11c, CD80, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR. iDCs were pre-incubated for 1 h with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) and then infected with EV71 at a MOI of 5. total protein concentration was determined by the bicinchoninic acid protein assay kit (Pierce) luminex fluorescent technique iDCs were infected with EV71 at a MOI of 5 for 1 h at 37\u00b0C, washed twice and cultured in RPMI medium. the supernatants were collected at 24 h p.i. by centrifugation at 3, 000 g for 30 min. fluorescence data in each standard, quality control and samples were detected with the FLEXMAP3D. at 1/2 h, 2 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i., iDCs were collected and the expressions of molecules in p38 MAPK signaling pathways were examined by PCR arrays. the mRNA levels of MEK3/6, MEK4/7, JNK1, JNK2, and p38 MAPK(/) were upregulated by 2.02 - 3.08 - fold at different times of EV71 p.i. in different time, while EV71 replication was inhibited in iDCs pre-incubated with or without SP600125 and SB203580. iDCs pre-incubated with or without SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) for 1 h and infected with EV71 at a. expression of EV71 VP1 protein in iDCs treated with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) significantly reduced expression of EV71 VP1 protein at 4 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i., respectively. h, 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i. were examined by Western blot. phosphorylation of JNK1/2 reached its peak at 1 h p.i., while that of p38 MAPK reached its peak at 2 h and 24 h p.i. EV71 infection upregulated expression of c-Fos and c-Jun at mRNA level. c-Fos was rapidly phosphorylated by EV71 infection, reaching its peak at 24 h p.i. and delayed by pretreatment with SP600125 and SB203580. western blot results of cell lysates collected at indicated times of iDCs pretreated with SP600125 (20 M) for 1 h and infected with EV71 (MOI = 5) for 24 h using antibodies against total and phosphorylated c-Fos and c-Jun. iDCs and iDCs pretreated with inhibitor SP600125 or SB203580 (20 M) prior to EV71 infection were collected at 24 h p.i. and used to detect the levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, IL-12 p70, TNF-, IFN- and IFN- in iDCs. pretreatment with SP600125 or SB203580 only significantly inhibited the production of IL mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-, and IFN- were upregulated by 2.02 - 3.08 - fold at different times of EV71 p.i. in different time, while c-Jun and c-Fos were increased by 3.03 to 9.17 - fold. mRNA levels of IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-, and IFN- were upregulated by 2.02 - MAP2K6 (MEK6) +1.08 +2.30 +1.76 +1.08 MAP2K7 (MEK7) +1.61 +1.10 +2.75 +1.00 MAPK8 (JNK1; SAPK1) +1.27 +2.30 +1.10 +1.40 MAPK9 (JNK2; SAPK1) +1.14 +1.31 +2.59 +1.18 MAPK10 (JNK3) +1.89 +1. iDCs pre-incubated with or without SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) for 1 h and infected with EV71 at a MOI of 5 for 24 h. expression of EV71 VP1 protein in iDCs treated with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) significantly reduced expression of EV71 VP1 protein at 4 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i., respectively. iDCs pre-incubated with or without SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) for 1 h and infected with EV71 at a MOI of 5 for 24 h. expression of EV71 VP1 protein in iDCs treated with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) significantly reduced expression of EV71 VP1 protein at 4 h, 8 h and 24 h p.i., respectively. phosphorylation of JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK in EV71-infected iDCs increased mRNA levels. phosphorylation of p38 MAPK reached its peak at 1 h p.i., while p38 MAPK reached its peak at 2 h and 24 h p.i. western blot analysis of cell lysates of iDCs preincubated with SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) for 1 h and infected with EV71 at a MOI of 5 at indicated times using antibodies against total and phosphorylated JNK1/2, p38 MAPK. the intensities of phosphorylated JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK were normalized to control level. pretreatment with SP600125 for 1 h, but delayed by pretreatment with SB203580. c-Jun was also rapidly phosphorylated by EV71 infection, reaching its peak within 2 h p.i. secretions of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12, TNF-,IFN- and IFN- iDCs can secrete several cytokines once they are activated by viral infection. EV71 infection (MOI = 5) significantly increased secretions of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, TNF-, IFN- and IFN- in iDCs. cytokine levels of uninfected iDCs and EV71-infected iDCs with or without inhibitor SP600125 and SB203580 (20 M) were measured by luminex fluorescence technique. the data were expressed as mean SE from at least three independent experiments. the mammalian JNKs are encoded by three distinct genes (jnk1, jnk2 and jnk3) they are strongly activated in response to cytokines, UV irradiation, growth factor deprivation, DNA damaging agents, and viral infection. the upstream activators for JNK pathway, i.e., MAP2Ks, are MEK4 and MEK7. all MAPKs are activated by MAPK kinases-mediated dual Thr and Tyr phosphorylation. EV71 infection promoted mRNA levels of MEK3, MEK6 and p38 MAPK. p38 MAPK pathway also plays an important role in EV71 infection. EV71 infection of iDCs significantly increased production of IL-2, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40, TNF- and IFN. enhanced secretions of IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-, but not IL-12 and IFN, were remarkably inhibited by pretreatment with SP600125 and SB203580. p38 MAPK regulate viral replication by acting at certain specific steps of viral replication cycle. underlying mechanisms need to be further studied in vitro or in vivo. authors declare that they have no competing interest."}
