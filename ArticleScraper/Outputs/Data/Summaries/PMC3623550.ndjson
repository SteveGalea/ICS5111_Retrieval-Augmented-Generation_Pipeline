{"summary": "type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the most common type of diabetes mellitus. it is characterized by insulin resistance and combined with relatively reduced insulin secretion. people developing the disease may suffer from blindness, renal failure, coronary artery disease, and so forth. the novel PPAR/PPAR dual agonist has drawn considerable attention. a critical problem surrounds how to identify the selectivity ratio of the receptor subtype. there is more information available about designing potential dual treatments for treating T2DM. the present study was initiated in an attempt to screen the fragment database in hopes to find a new antidiabetic compound. the techniques of the core hopping associated with the glide docking and molecular dynamic simulation were used to analyze the binding interactions between the agonist and PPARs. the binding site encompassed the ligand GW409544, which was observed in the crystal structures of both PPAR and PPAR (1k7l) the binding site of PPARs is composed of three arms: arm 1, arm 2, and arm 3, as marked in the panels A and B of Figure 1. PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha; PPAR, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma. arm 1 has a predominately polar character and includes the AF2-helix. the vital conformation of AF2-helix could generate a charge clamp formed by the network hydrogen bonds. cores preparation consisted of generating possible states by ionization at a target pH of 7.0 2.0, desalting, retaining specified chiralities from the three-dimensional structure, and completing geometry minimization with the OPLS2005 force field. a new docking algorithm called \u201ccore hopping\u201d was employed. the fourth step was to align and dock the entire molecular structure built up by the core and scaffold. all investigated compounds were redocked into the receptor pocket via the rigid protein docking model with the Stand-Precision scoring function to estimate the binding affinities. the corresponding coordinates are stored every 2ps (picosecond, or 1012 of a second) the corresponding coordinates are stored every 2ps (picosecond, or 1012 of a second). the corresponding coordinates are stored every 2ps (picosecond, or 1012 of a second). the two proteins contain the same ligand, GW409544, which is used to easily identify the binding site. the binding site of PPARs is composed of three arms: arm 1, arm 2, and arm 3, as marked in the panels A and B of Figure 1. the carbon atoms of ragaglitazar and Comp#1 were covered by ragaglitazar. the blue dotted lines indicate the H-bond interactions of the receptor with its ligands. the purple helix is a part of the AF2 function domain. scaffold by the Glide5 docking program (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC),35,36 was interfaced with Schr\u00f6dinger Suite 2009 (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC) the preparation and refinement protocols for the protein receptor and all compound structures were performed on the Protein Preparation Wizard and LigPrep modules. the process included assigning bond orders, adding hydrogen, treating metals, treating disulfides, deleting waters, alleviating potential steric hindrance, adjusting bond order. the first step was to define the possible points to which the cores were attached. this could be done by operating the \u201cProtocore Preparation\u201d module. the fourth step was to align and dock the entire molecular structure built up by the core and scaffold. the minimum number of sodium and chloride ions needed to balance the system charge was placed randomly in the solvated system. the corresponding coordinates are stored every 2ps (picosecond, or 1012 of a second) the corresponding coordinates are stored every 2ps (picosecond, or 1012 of a second) the normal mode of prediction of QikProp was used in this study. the property analysis for the molecular weight \u2013 partition coefficient (QP logP o/w) predicted aqueous solubility; in addition, apparent PMDCK permeability (QPP MDCK) was computed in the QikProp program to evaluate whether the compounds hold the potential to become drug candidates. the top hit compound, ZINC36728034, was selected as the most potential lead compound for further modification, according to the vital importance of the acidic head of the ligand. the core hopping method was used to search the fragment database for replacing the amide group (ie, the R0 group) by the best ten R groups (ie, the R1 to R10). the current study is quite similar to a previous study,38 for we used the same protein targets, fragment database, core hopping method, and molecular dynamics modeling. the best docked poses of the ten compounds are superposed together in the active pockets of the receptors, PPAR (1k71) and PPAR (1k74) ragaglitazar and Comp#1 were observed in docking simulation. ragaglitazar and ragaglitazar had key residues for binding interactions. ragaglitazar has the strongest binding affinity with PPAR and PPAR. the ten compounds (Comp#1\u2013#10) were ranked roughly according to their docking scores to the receptors PPAR and PPAR Compound Docking scores (Kcal/mol) ADME properties predicted PPAR (1k71) PPAR (1k74) PSAa logPo/wb logSc PPCacod Human oral absorptione Ragaglitazar 11.49 12.29. the accepted region is (7.0 to 200.0); b the predicted octanol/water partition coefficient. d predicted apparent Caco-2 cell permeability in nm/second. PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar, PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar, PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar, PPAR\u2013Comp#1 and PPAR\u2013Comp#1. all of the characters concerned reached the simulation equilibrium within the 5 ns. the results of molecular dynamic simulations for the interactions of the receptors with Comp#1. PPAR\u2013Comp#1 and PPAR\u2013Comp#1 are more stable than PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar and PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar. the RMSD values of PPAR\u2013Comp#1 and PPAR\u2013Comp#1 are remarkably smaller than those of PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar and PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar. the ten compounds found in this study, particularly the Comp#1 compound, hold very high potential to become a new drug candidate. binding pocket In drug design, particularly for conducting mutagenesis studies, the information of the binding pocket of a targeted receptor with its ligand is crucially important. yr-314 Ile-317 Arg-288 *Ser-289 *His-323 Phe-318 Leu-321 Val-324 Ile-326 Tyr-327 Leu-330 Met-330 Leu-331 Val-332 Leu-333 Val-339 Leu-340 *Ala-333 Tyr-334 Leu-344 Ile-341 Ser-342 Met348 Leu-347 Phe-351 Ile-354 Leu-353 Phe-360 Phe-355 Ly the functional acidic group exits in the following structures muraglitazar,76 faraglitazar,77 GW6471,78 GW7845,77 CHEMBL166572,79 and so on. the new molecule Comp#0 was designed with the intention so it has stronger affinity than ZINC36728034. the core hopping method was used to search the fragment database for the desired chemical groups to replace the amide group (ie, the R0 group) the core hopping method was used to search the fragment database for replacing the amide group (ie, the R0 group) by the best ten R groups (ie, R1 to R10). the current study used virtual screening as the first operation to find the novel scaffold against PPARs. however, the starting point at which the study was carried out is very different. polar acidic head group was chosen as a positive control for its high affinity with the PPAR and PPAR receptors in the previous research. the top ten compounds (ie, Comp#1 to Comp#10) are much stronger than ragaglitazar and Comp#0 in binding to the two PPAR (1k71) and PPAR (1k74) receptors. the compound ragaglitazar has an extra hydrophobic part, making it more fitted to the hydrophobic arm 1. the compound ragaglitazar was used as a positive control. ragaglitazar has the strongest binding affinity with the receptors PPAR and PPAR. #5 13.18 13.85 13.62 5.96 6.40 141.02 64.80 Comp#6 13.01 13.68 183.70 4.55 6.47 106.99 55.75 Comp#7 12.95 14.11 118.33 6.23 6.25 175.59 71.11 Comp#8 13.85 13.07 152.69 5.01 6.15 105.27 43.31 Comp#9 13.36 13.45 146.77 5.83 6.30 134.45 62.69 Comp#10 13.04 14.

PPAR, PPAR, PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar, PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar, PPAR\u2013Comp#1 and PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar are more stable than PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar and PPAR\u2013ragaglitazar. RMSD from initial conformation is a major criterion used to evaluate the stability of a protein system. PPAR\u2013Comp#1 and the residues 469\u2013477 of PPAR\u2013Comp#1 are very likely to perform exactly the same function in activating the AF2 helix as the compound ragaglitazar did. the predicted ADME properties, such as the polar surface area, logPo/w, logS, PPCaco, are either much better than or quite close to that of ragaglitazar. ligand Comp#1a PPAR (1k7l) PPAR (1k74) leu-254 Glu-269 Ile-272 Pro-269 Ala-278 Arg-280 Phe-273 Cys-275 Cys-276 Ile-281 Phe-282 Gly-284 Gln-277 Cys278 Thr-279 Cys-285 Gln-286 Phe-287 *Ser-280 *Tyr-314 Ile-318 Leu-3 liferator-activated receptor-gamma."}
