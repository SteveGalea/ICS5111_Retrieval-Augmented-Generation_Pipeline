{"summary": "global maternal and infant mortality remains unacceptably high in the 21st century. despite a 44% reduction since 1990, the global maternal mortality ratio was estimated to be 216 (207 to 249) per 100,000 live births in 2015. 4.9 million children under 5 years of age died in 2015 (nearly 16,000 every day), with neonatal mortality accounting for approximately 45% of all deaths. experts at a BMGF-convened meeting on maternal immunization in resource-limited settings agreed that maternal immunization must be integrated within the ANC platform (4). this approach is supported by the Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) who have advised the world health organization to generate generalizable data on the best ways to integrate maternal immunization into routine antenatal care. the WHO Product Development for Vaccines Advisory Committee (PDVAC) identified as a priority the development of GBS vaccines suitable for maternal immunization in pregnancy and use in LMIC. in response, WHO developed a GBS Preferred Product Characteristics guideline and a Vaccine Development Technology Roadmap to focus on activities leading to development, testing, licensure, and global availability of GBS vaccines. nearly 300 participants attended the two-and-a-half-day meeting. the meeting included 16 invited expert presentations, 25 oral presentations from submitted abstracts, 30 poster presentations. the third day focused on implementation aspects of maternal and neonatal immunization worldwide. the impact of maternal antiplatelet IgG fucosylation on fetal thrombocytopenia is illustrated by the impact of maternal antiplatelet IgG fucosylation on the severity of fetal thrombocytopenia. a large range of features was assessed to broadly characterize Abs and identify correlates of protection. a large range of features was assessed to broadly characterize Abs. in-depth analysis of gene expression indicated that the intrinsic cellular restriction factor APOBEC3A (A3A) may be an important innate mechanism of CMV control at the placental level (7). this work should help the development of interventions protecting placental functions and preventing pathogen transmission following maternal infections. maternal cofactors influence immune ontogeny and immune responses in early life. studies of hepatitis B and oral polio immunization at birth indicated that priming of memory B cells can be achieved in early life. an ideal vaccine to be administered to neonates would induce rapid immune response even in presence of MatAbs. acellular pertussis vaccination at birth increases the response to the second dose of vaccine at 2 months of life (a priming role) some studies showed reduced responses to vaccines concomitantly administered with the second pertussis vaccine dose. another limitation of pertussis immunization at birth may be the induction of Th2-polarized cellular immune responses. vaccine-specific memory B cell responses to pneumococcus antigens can be detected in mothers and infants after maternal immunization with 13-valent pneumococcal vaccine. vaccine-induced antipolysaccharide Abs may require concentrations higher than those induced by natural immunity. innate memory also exists in mammals but has been less well studied. key histone modifications increasing access to chromatin are detected in primed monocytes. blocking these modifications inhibits cell priming. risk of hospitalization was related to time at initiation of antiretroviral therapy in the pregnant women. risk of hospitalization was 4-fold higher when mothers initiated therapy during pregnancy but not significantly increased when treatment was started before pregnancy. occus is a leading cause of maternal and neonatal morbidity worldwide. recent estimates associate GBS with at least 409,000 (uncertainty range [UR], 144,000 to 573,000) maternal-fetal-infant cases of disease and 147,000 (UR, 47,000 to 273,000) stillbirths and infant deaths annually. the first 3 months of life through maternal vaccination is sufficient to address both early- and late-onset disease. lower responses to candidate GBS vaccines have been seen in HIV-infected women than in uninfected women. iii) pertussis immunization in pregnancy. infants born to Tdap-vaccinated women are randomized to either whole-cell pertussis- or acellular pertussis-containing infant vaccines. the optimal timing of Tdap vaccination in pregnancy was calculated to be at least 8 weeks prior to delivery. the next session was dedicated to examine perceptions related to maternal immunization globally and how they might impact vaccine uptake. the next session was dedicated to examine perceptions related to maternal and neonatal immunization. Linda Eckert (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA) described efforts to harmonize the assessment of the safety of vaccines in pregnancy, providing her perspectives as a front-line obstetrician. she first highlighted that safety represents a key obstacle to maternal immunization. paper-based, patient-held immunization records currently in use in these countries do not have fields for recoding of essential data. lack of reliable electricity supply and computer/tablet hardware availability in many LMIC limits electronic data capturing. no system for the central storage of antenatal data is in place. the sentinel Initiative of the post-licensure rapid immunoization safety monitoring (PRISM) program analyzes information in electronic health care databases. he highlighted the gap in implementation research, the need to optimize delivery strategies for vaccines in pregnancy, and the importance placed on supporting such research as highlighted by WHO\u2019s strategic Advisory Group of experts. an ideal schedule was considered to offer the best opportunity to provide optimal protection with the minimum of risk. the 6-, 10-, and 14-week primary immunization schedule had been adopted to maximize vaccine coverage in early infancy as rapidly as possible. the program was introduced in 2012 in response to a sharp increase in pertussis disease cases in those too young to have been vaccinated (23). the program was successfully implemented early on but coverage was increased when the start of the window for vaccination was broadened from >28 to >16 weeks of gestation. the human immunome comprises the complete set of recombined immune receptor (T and B cell receptor) genes. the human immunome comprises the complete set of recombined immune receptor (T and B cell receptor) genes and is much larger than the human genome. the project will allow investigators to better profile the response to vaccines, understand the genetic features underlying variability in response. the vaccine was safe and well tolerated, resulting in high-level immunogenicity, with the highest peak response observed in infants vaccinated at 8 weeks of age. countries with the highest mortality rates also demonstrate higher sepsis death rates. countries with the highest mortality rates also demonstrate higher prematurity and intrapartum stillbirth rates. participants were asked to address the following key questions. the first panel focused on the topic \"Implementing and Integrating Maternal and Infant Immunization: Challenges and Opportunities\" panel was asked if they considered it feasible to integrate maternal and infant immunization schedules. panel suggested developing a maternal immunization investment case to depict the concept and advantages of maternal immunization. ideally equipping ANC clinics with immunization facilities\u2014logistics and skills. key messages from stakeholdersa Stakeholder Main obstacles Potential solutions Investigators Lack of baseline data for maternal and neonatal outcomes Partnering with local care providers and the community, including women who have received vaccines in pregnancy. the maternal immunization platform has high potential for addressing neonatal deaths, preterm births, and stillbirths. the platform fits well into the lifetime vaccination approach taken by PAHO and SAGE. global maternal and infant mortality remains unacceptably high in the 21st century. despite a 44% reduction since 1990, the global maternal mortality ratio was estimated to be 216 (207 to 249) per 100,000 live births in 2015. mortality ratio to 70 per 100,000 live births and end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age. all countries must reduce neonatal mortality to 12 per 1,000 live births and under-5 mortality to 25 per 1,000 live births. vaccines administered during pregnancy and/or early life offer the potential to protect mothers against infection-related morbidity. several global projects are addressing this mandate and identifying opportunities and challenges for the introduction of new vaccines for maternal immunization. the maternal Influenza Immunization project provides guidelines for the implementation of influenza vaccination in pregnant women in LMIC, and the maternal Immunization in Antenatal Care Situational Analysis (MIACSA) the 4th International Neonatal and Maternal Immunization Symposium (INMIS) convened experts from academia, industry, regulatory and funding agencies, public health, and international organizations in Brussels (Belgium) from 10 to 12 September 2017. nearly 300 participants attended the two-and-a-half-day meeting that included 16 invited expert presentations, 25 oral presentations from submitted abstracts, 30 poster presentations, and 2 expert panel discussions. Margaret Ackerman (Dartmouth College, USA) discussed how vaccine design can be informed by systems serology. she discussed how vaccine design can be informed by systems serology. she discussed how vaccine design can be informed by systems serology. the placenta plays a central role in maternal tolerance of the fetus. it actively transports maternal IgG via the neonatal Fc receptor expressed by syncytiotrophoblasts. infection of decidua, forming the maternal component of the placenta, is likely to be the initiation of pathogen transmission to the fetus. the impact of maternal vaccination with 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on the presence of vaccine antigen-specific memory B cells in colostrum. despite challenges inherent to vaccine development in the very young, there is a robust rationale for continued vaccine development for this population. studies of hepatitis B and oral polio immunization at birth indicated that priming of memory B cells can be achieved in early life. ideal vaccine to be administered to neonates would induce rapid immune response even in the presence of matAbs. studies of neonatal immunization with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine showed good safety and early induction of Abs. the presence of MatAbs results in interference with active infant immunization. the presence of MatAbs results in interference with active infant immunization. naturally acquired MatAbs against pneumococcal proteins protect infants from carriage. vaccine-induced antipolysaccharide Abs may require concentrations higher than those induced by natural immunity to be effective (13). iii) Heterologous immunity. some combinations of agonists act in synergy to activate Th1-polarizing responses from human neonatal antigen-presenting cells. agonists alone or combined with alum and/or TLR agonists may be candidate adjuvants for early life immunization (15). the best evidence of protection comes from the success of monoclonal antibody (MAb) to F protein. the age profile of RSV disease supports an association between susceptibility and levels of MatAb. a number of vaccine candidates are under development and evaluation (15, 17) invasive infections may be due to the fact that 90% of early-onset disease occurs on day 1 of life. the bulk of disease and attributable infant mortality will be unrecognized if cases die at home or are not investigated adequately in health care facilities. studies of conjugate vaccines have demonstrated safety and immunogenicity with good persistence of Abs in vaccinated mothers. isolated GBS types were reflective of both countries, including type VII (prevalent in south Asia) and type IV, which is emerging in the united states (22). evidence is robust that maternal immunization with acellular pertussis vaccines is safe and effective in protecting neonates and young infants from disease. the study was conducted at Imperial College in the united kingdom. it investigated the contributions of emerging pertussis strains to early cellular immune responses to vaccines. cytokine responses were again strain dependent and differed in some cytokines in infants. s related to maternal and neonatal immunization: the importance of building trust. Heidi Larson (London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, United Kingdom) opened the session. she highlighted the universally sensitive nature of pregnancy worldwide. a set of preterm birth core outcomes has recently been published. a number of other ongoing initiatives were described before Dr. Eckert concluded we are poised for a new era in harmonization of safety reporting. a number of steps could be taken to improve safety reporting in LMIC. the future introduction of vaccines where they are most needed will not be delayed. the study confirmed an absence of association between maternal influenza vaccination and different adverse birth outcomes. progress, challenges, and opportunities for maternal influenza immunization identified by each of the WHO Regions were then described. low population uptake in the European region (EURO) was a particular challenge. the panamerican health organization is reported as the region making the strongest progress overall. a number of factors affecting an infant\u2019s response to their primary series were listed. Dr. Asturias reviewed a number of key publications demonstrating the effects of MatAbs on infant vaccine immunogenicity. he also highlighted the growing appreciation of the role of the microbiota in infant immunity. no cases of death reported to date in infants born to correctly vaccinated mothers. IMPRINT network introduces new and potential future targets for maternal and neonatal immunization. potential new targets include pandemic influenza (for elderly and infants), seasonal influenza, ZIKV, GBS, pertussis, MRSA, nosocomial infections (e.g., Rift Valley fever virus, Lassa fever virus), MERS CoV, and therapeutic rabies virus. new epitopes are the alternative way to identify new candidates instead of whole infectious agents. the highest peak response observed in infants vaccinated at 8 weeks of age. the highest peak response observed in infants vaccinated at 8 weeks of age. the highest peak response was observed in infants vaccinated at 8 weeks. a recent review has now estimated the burden of global deaths due to sepsis with antimicrobial-resistant organisms (46). maternal vaccines (especially RSV and GBS) have the potential to reduce AMR by reducing the empirical use of antibiotics. a vaccine could be used to target determinants of antibiotic resistance, and improve prevention of resistant strains. participants included Azhar Abid Raza (UNICEF), Edwin Asturias (University of Colorado, Denver), Nele Berthels (FAMHP, Belgium), Ed Clarke (MRC Unit, The Gambia), Claire Cutland (University of the Witwatersrand), Linda Eckert (University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA), Philipp Lambach (World Health Organization), and Elke Leuridan (University of Antwerp). the panel was asked if they considered a strong maternal immunization platform is required that normalizes vaccination practice among obstetric care providers. a strong maternal immunization platform is required that normalizes vaccination practice among obstetric care providers. early and timely availability of resources for program implementation and community awareness will be instrumental. clinical development of novel vaccines requires frequent interactions with the Regulator. ethics committees need to be strengthened and include adequate multidisciplinary and regional representation of relevant experts. if a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial is not possible, refrain from doing studies altogether. the maternal immunization platform has high potential for addressing neonatal deaths, preterm births, and stillbirths. the platform fits well into the lifetime vaccination approach taken by PAHO and SAGE. clear challenges and goals were formulated by participants at the meeting. progress in all areas is needed to enhance our knowledge about vaccines recommended for maternal and neonatal immunization."}{"summary": "global maternal and infant
