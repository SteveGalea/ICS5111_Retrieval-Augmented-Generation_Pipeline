{"summary": "researchers conducted semi-structured interviews and examined supplementary materials in the form of organizational documents, correspondence, and websites to create a complete picture of each case. rigor of the case series was ensured through data and investigator triangulation. e case series focuses on disaster and emergency planning for library operations, collection protection, technical services, and financial management. previous study identified roles for librarians in disasters as institutional supporters, collection managers, information disseminators, internal planners, community supporters, government partners, educators and trainers. a clinical librarian can play a vital role on emergency teams by contributing \u201cup-to-the-minute access\u201d to information. the project concluded libraries should be an integral part of hospitals' emergency preparedness structure. a protocol in coordination with emergency preparedness teams would allow for integrated librarian support. the role of social media has been identified as an effective tool for building knowledge and disseminating information in the age of social media. multisite comparative case series design researchers selected a multisite comparative series study design as it allowed for an analytic induction approach, with a specific issue or problem as the focal point. the emerging infectious disease, H1N1, served as the focal point for the case series. investigators digitally recorded each interview, and the MP3 files were transcribed by a professional transcription service. investigators collected available supporting documentation from each case. investigators followed popular coding strategies for qualitative research. investigators distributed an exploratory survey during the first wave of the pandemic in southwestern Ontario. the survey would gather data about H1N1 information needs as quickly as possible during the first wave of the outbreak. the response rate was low\u2014four completed surveys\u2014but one respondent recounted a project to provide H1N1 information that far exceeded a typical reference transaction. data collection The investigators collected data through two methods. a minimum of two coinvestigators conducted semi-structured interviews with project leaders. researchers compared coded sections to reveal \"repeated patterns of meaning\" RESULTS Case descriptions Table 1 provides brief descriptions of the four cases included in the series. email and in-person requests were the most popular methods by which librarians in all cases were initially contacted to provide H1N1 information. librarians were asked to provide priority support to the pandemic incident management team. librarians' tasks were to monitor key websites and provide updates to the integrated vice president of information management and the pandemic incident manager. librarians performed weekly searches for published, peer-reviewed journal articles. email discussion lists, Twitter, blogs, really simple syndication feeds, Facebook, Friend Feed, Mendeley citation management software, and wikis were all described as communication tools. wikis were the final destination for gathered information and the tools by which information was communicated with audiences. the other client-initiated case involved a narrowly prescribed communication method. librarian-initiated cases provided H1N1 information without an organizational infrastructure supporting them. both projects fell outside of the librarians' regular work responsibilities. librarian-initiated cases provided H1N1 information without an organizational infrastructure supporting them. librarians sought information from \"trusted\" sources, like PubMed. one librarian-initiated and one client-initiated case reported gathering information exclusively from \"credible\" sources. one client-initiated case reported needing \"high evidence-based information\" 1N1 questions and information requests by health professionals were recorded and received by a librarian working with a government health department Librarians. librarians used their judgment to determine how much information to include in their summaries. if they reported school closures or clinics for flushots things like that then I would filter them out. libGuides was a web platform for publishing text, resource links, videos, and widgets. participants did not report consulting all sources in all cases. librarians located local, provincial, statewide, and international statistics. librarian-initiated cases were heavy users of social media technologies. information was compiled and stored on wikis before being published on the web. one librarian described \u201cleveraging the network effect\u201d and managing a wiki. librarians distributed an email survey to help inform and improve future implementations of the library's involvement in pandemic disease planning. brief descriptions of the four cases included in the series are presented in a loosely chronological order. librarian was asked to join the reference group that advised the chief public health officer and the top level planning committee for the pandemic response. questions originated from \u201cphysicians out in the field\u201d and were filtered through the public health office. librarian-initiated cases, social media facilitated rapid information dissemination and sharing. librarians emailed a small audience of 3 administrators an update of H1N1 news and statistics by 10:30 a.m. every morning, in time for a daily 11:00 a.m. meeting of the critical incident planning team. librarians developed a standardized format (Appendix C, online only) for presenting their daily email updates so that they could be analyzed quickly. librarian-initiated cases provided full-text H1N1 information without an organizational infrastructure supporting them. both projects fell outside of the librarians' regular work responsibilities, leaving little time for rigorous assessments of the information selected for inclusion on their wikis. librarians created alerts so they could monitor information as it was published. one librarian-initiated and one client-initiated case reported gathering information exclusively from \"credible\" sources. the other cases reported including information from news sources and government agencies. librarians reported'selecting news items' when there were 50. librarians reported'selecting news items' if they reported school closures or clinics for flushots. if they reported a school closure in St. Johns, they would filter them out. study participants did not report consulting all sources in all cases. librarians located local, provincial, statewide, and international statistics on confirmed cases and deaths. librarians also gained a sense of which sources were updated the fastest. iated cases were heavy users of social media technologies, such as wikis, twitter, facebook, and RSS feeds. one librarian described \u201cleveraging the network effect\u201d and managing a wiki that received more than 25,000 hits. as the pandemic escalated, Google Scholar became an effective method for librarians to monitor information as it was being published on the web. the exploratory survey was distributed during the first wave of the pandemic in 2009. the process of obtaining academic ethics approval delayed recruiting participants in the case series and collecting data until the early months of 2010. investigators hypothesize that similarities between the cases are typical of the experiences of librarians who conducted H1N1 information support. truistic initiatives proved difficult to evaluate, whereas the clear lines of communication between administrator and librarian facilitated direct feedback in the client-initiated cases. librarians providing H1N1 information via social media assumed the work of gathering, organizing, and sharing information individually and in addition to their professional duties. four cases of H1N1 projects by health librarians analyzed for this qualitative case series informed understanding of pandemic information needs. best practices for librarians providing pandemic information include: formalizing librarian inclusion on institutional disaster management teams, disseminating concise summaries of current and authoritative information to support administrative and clinical decision making."}
