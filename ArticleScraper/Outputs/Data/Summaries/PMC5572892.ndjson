{"summary": "40 (63.5%) of the 63 ferrets were infected with ferret HEV (5). for the observation of the ferret HEV particles, we used a 10% suspension prepared from the fecal specimen from 1 of the ferrets (no. F4370), concentrated by ultracentrifugation and purified by sucrose gradient ultracentrifugation. however, instead of finding ferret HEV particles, we observed many coronavirus-like particles 63 ferret fecal specimens, 22 (34.9%) were positive for FRSCV RNA, 53 (84.1%) were positive for FRECV RNA, and 15 (23.8%) were positive for both FRSCV and FRECV RNA. results indicated that the ferrets were infected extensively with FRCoV. the complete genome of FRCoV4370 shared 49.9%\u201368.9% nucleotide identity with other known CoVs. FRCoV4370 shared 49.9%\u201368.9% nucleotide identity with other known CoVs. FRCoV4370 forms a new cluster with FRSCV MSU-1, FRECV MSU-2, and no22. we compared 8,300 nt sequences of the 3\u2032-termini of CoVs. BLAST analysis revealed that FRCoV4370 shared 94% identity with FRECV MSU-2. coronaviruses have a pseudoknot tertiary structure that allows a ribosomal shift of the reading frame between ORF1a and ORF1b (7\u20139) the ribosomal shift may have resulted in generation of the ORF1a/b protein encoding 19,962 nt and the deduced 6,653 aa. the BLAST analysis of the S protein showed that it had low aa identities (43%\u201366%) the predicted ORF3c protein contains 247 aa and shared 96.8% aa identity with FRECV MSU-2 and 77.6% with FRECV No22. the 2 other nonstructural proteins, 3x and 7b, are located downstream of the N protein and encode 74 aa and 204 aa. this new knowledge of the complete genome sequence of FRECV will contribute to investigations of the diversity of animal CoVs."}
