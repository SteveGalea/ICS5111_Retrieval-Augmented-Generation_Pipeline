{"summary": "alphavirus researchers studied a 6 kilodalton protein aptly named 6K. this protein was identified to play a role in virus exit and function as an ion channel. the protein was not required for virus infection. the viral proteins E3, 6K, or TF may also be present in the virion. ribosomal components have been shown to be packaged within the core. alphaviruses can replicate efficiently in small animal models and host-derived cell lines. the capsid protein encapsidates newly synthesized viral RNA to form nucleocapsid cores in the cytoplasm. the protein is translated, folded in the cytoplasm, and then cleaved in cis via its chymotrypsin-like domain from the rest of the polyprotein. the polyprotein traverses the ER membrane several times. the consequence of translating E2 but not E1 due to the frameshifting event is not understood. the positive-sense RNA alphavirus genome has two open reading frames. at the 5\u2019 end is the methyl-7-guanosine cap (m7G), followed by the nonstructural protein (nsP) and structural protein open reading frames. signalase cleaves E1 from 6K, and E2 from 6K and TF. the second transmembrane domain of E2 is released into the cytoplasm. the protein remains covalently attached to E2 and aids with cellular chaperones in proper folding of E2 and E1. in arthropod cells, budding is observed at internal membranes. this usually occurs at the plasma membrane from vertebrate cells. the mechanism of alphavirus budding is not known but studies have attributed defects in assembly and budding to mutation in the 6K gene. frameshifting in viruses is well-studied in retroviruses where the pol open reading frame is in the (1) reading frame relative to Gag upstream [47,48,49] many viruses use frameshifting as a strategy to maximize their coding potential. the 6K and TF proteins each contain an identical N-terminal transmembrane domain and a short cysteine-rich cytoplasmic loop prior to their unique C-terminal ends. as integral membrane proteins, 6K and TF are both found in membranous fractions of cells, and extract with anionic (SDS and sodium deoxycholate), nonionic (NonidetTM P-40, IGEPAL\u00ae CA-630, and Triton X-100), the order in which the viruses are listed follows their relationships according to phylogeny, see [40]. blue is least conserved and red is most conserved. scores of 8 or above are highlighted. studies up to this point support that both the 6K and TF proteins are important in budding. the absence of 6K and TF in 6K reduces virus production by 10\u2013100 fold. the absence of 6K and TF in 6K reduces virus production by 10\u2013100 fold. 6K and TF proteins affect released virus particles by functioning inside the host cell where budding is initiated. a new protein of 4200 daltons was thought to represent the cleaved signal sequence for a glycoprotein. 4.2K protein was not glycosylated, incorporated into virions or released into the media. the SFV 6K protein was not glycosylated, present in mature virions, or released into the media. the field now refers to the 6K gene product as the 6K protein. the gene encoding 6K was after E2 in the viral genome [73]. low frameshifting rates could also reflect a need for maintaining a high amount of TF translation for optimal spike assembly and low E2 misfolding levels. researchers looked at the modifications on the 6K protein. 6K was the first (and only) alphavirus gene to allow the recovery of an infectious virus after its deletion. the 6K virus yield from mammalian cell cultures is lower than WT at high growth temperatures. 6K defect appears to be due to inappropriate glycoprotein processing and/or trafficking. in mammalian cells heterologous 6K or TF expression does not rescue a deficiency. the virus manifests a consistent delay in growth kinetics. 6K/TF cysteine mutants bud multi-cored particles with multi-hit kinetics of thermal inactivation [13,55,92] this multi-cored defect was also observed for a temperature-sensitive mutation in SINV E2 [93] the authors postulated that an E2:6K protein interaction might be necessary for the E2 tail to interact with the capsid protein. chimeric viruses swapped in the RRV 6K gene, or the 6K:E1 gene pair, with the SINV genes in a SINV backbone. chimeric construct would have a native RRV 6K, but for TF, a RRV sequence in the N-terminus and SINV sequence in the C-terminus. mutant virus decreased budding and low E1 levels detected at the plasma membrane. 6K29 mutant virions were indistinguishable from WT except that in the particle, they could not detect 6K (which we now know is the TF protein) in the particle, they detected a trans-dominant negative effect on titer output in co-infections with WT. internal budding is regularly observed for WT virus in mosquito cell infections. a 6K deficiency may simply route virus budding to an alternate exit pathway that is less efficient at release from mammalian cells. these functional defects support the idea that an interaction between the glycoproteins and 6K is important for budding. 6K gene expressed from a viral genome is the only major contributor to the membrane permeability changes observed in eukaryotic cells with normal intracellular trafficking. mutations and rescue attempts provide mounting evidence to support 6K\u2019s role in membrane permeabilization in standard cell culture models. studies on other known viroporins highlight the mechanisms by which membrane permeability to ions influences the outcome of a viral infection. the state of this field for viroporins that modulate intracellular ion homeostasis to affect pathogenesis and specifically promote virus release has been reviewed in detail. studies on TF ion channel activity during infection are not available. 6K may be similar to other viroporins, where ion modulation ties directly to virus exit. the slip site region could be a hotspot for recombination or template switching. mutations in 6K that prevent TF frameshifting significantly reduce morbidity and mortality in the same new world alphavirus in mice infected via aerosol. the CHIKV strain in the Caribbean lineage was found to sustain the 6K L20M mutation. a set of isolates from Colombia contained the same mutation, as well as additional mutations in the C-terminus of 6K that would also affect the TF sequence [142]. Interestingly, most subunit and virus-like particle vaccination approaches retain the 6K gene sequence [143,144] defects in spike folding or oligomerization efficiency in the absence of 6K are inhibitory to effective budding. studies to identify 6K interaction partners may also provide insight into differences in the location of budding observed between infected arthropod and mammalian host cells. the only known posttranslational modification on TF is its palmitoylation. it is also unknown which cellular palmitoyl transferases actually modify TF. studies focusing on TF alone are challenging without a TF-only virus. expressing TF after E1 would result in a TF protein with its N-terminus in the cytoplasm rather than in the lumen. a clever strategy using inert linkers or artificial signal sequences is therefore needed to build this useful virus tool. the predicted transmembrane domains may represent a single integral membrane helix. if 6K folds into a single membrane-spanning helix, its cysteine residues could reside in the membrane rather than in the cytoplasm. the precise membrane insertion of small membrane proteins is often difficult to assess with confidence. isoform that is incorporated may differ between alphaviruses based on localization. many antivirals on the market today are directed at virus escape. one well-known example is Tamiflu which blocks the neuraminidase activity required for influenza virus exit. 6K interacts with other proteins, viral and host, that promote budding. TF may oligomerize and function as an ion channel. TF has been demonstrated to play a role in virus budding. there is no quantitative data tracking TF levels within an infected cell population over time. we do not know if there are any proteinaceous factors that influence frameshifting. the only known posttranslational modification on TF is its palmitoylation. studies focusing on TF alone are challenging without a TF-only virus. expressing TF after E1 would result in a TF protein with its N-terminus in the cytoplasm rather than the lumen. a clever strategy using inert linkers or artificial signal sequences is therefore needed to build this useful tool. the precise membrane topology of the C-terminus of 6K is unknown. it likely is translated as a two-pass protein with both termini in the ER lumen. but post-cleavage it has been proposed to adopt a Type I membrane protein (single pass) or hairpin conformation. immediate interest regarding TF relate to its presence in the virion. it is not known if the population of virus particles is homogenous in its TF content. it is not known if the population of virus particles is homogenous in its TF content. studies addressing effects of modulating ion channel activity in infected cells are high priority. despite feasibility as an effective antiviral strategy, antivirals against virus release are not in widespread use. understanding the mechanisms of action of 6K and TF in escape could guide future efforts to fatally stall budding."}
