{"summary": "polyethylenimine 25K (PEI) is a cationic polymer which effectively delivers the plasmid DNA. the size of the PEI/pci-S nanoparticles appeared to be around 194.7 99.3 nm. the expression of the S mRNA and protein was confirmed in vitro. vere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an emerging infectious disease. re-emergence of SARS is possible due to existence of SARS-CoV like strains in animal reservoir. development of safe and effective vaccines is highly desired. it has been revealed that PEI is a very effective gene delivery vehicle for lung transfection producing high antibody titers against the encoded protein. the immune responses in mice immunized with i.n. route have been examined. the nanoparticles were observed as spherical shape with around 200 nm size. it is notable that cytotoxicity of PEI was measured in RAW 264.7 cells after transfection with PEI/pci-S complexes by using MTT assay. when the N/P ratio was 10, the cell viability was 87.5 7.3%. es elicited high level of SARS-CoV S-specific-serum IgG antibody but not in mice immunized with SARS-CoV S DNA alone. to access the balance of Th1/Th2 response, SARS S-specific IgG1 and IgG2a were evaluated in immunized mice. B220+ cells from mice immunized with PEI/pci-S complexes were highly proliferated after in vitro re-stimulation with SARS-CoV S protein. expression of cell surface molecules and maturation of dendritic cells (DCs) from mice stimulated with PEI/pci-S complexes. expressions of major cell surface molecules, CD80, CD83, CD86, CCR7, and MHC class II (I-Ad) on CD11c+ DC were determined by flow cytometry. significant differences compared with pci-S group were expressed as *P 0.05. ci-S complexes group was not detectable in pci-S group. it is to note that IL-4-producing cells were detectable neither in the lung nor spleen. it is to note that IL-4-producing cells were detectable neither in the lung nor spleen. expression of S mRNA in RAW 264.7 cells transfected with PEI/pci-S complexes was detected by RT-PCR. expression of S protein in RAW 264.7 cells with PEI/pci-S complexes was detected by Western blot. formation of PEI/pci-S nanoparticles was further confirmed by morphology observation. the cells treated with PEI/pci-S nanoparticles can induce the expression of detectable S protein. no protein was detected when pci-S was used alone. induction of (A) S-specific IgG subclasses in serum and (B) S-specific IgA in various mucosal samples were determined by ELISA. significant differences compared with pci-S group were expressed as *P 0.05 and **P 0.01, respectively. expression of cell surface molecules, CD80, CD83, CD86, CCR7 and MHC class II (I-Ad) on CD11c+ cells in cervical lymph nodes were analyzed on day 3 after the last immunization. cytokine profiles were examined by using intracellular cytokine assays. FN-+, IL-2+ and IL-17+ cells were not detected in CD8+ cells from mice immunized with PEI/pci-S complexes. re-stimulation with SARS-CoV S peptide induced the activation of cytokine-producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells with a predominant production of TNF- as well as TNF- and IL-2 double cytokine-producing cells. it is to note people from 26 countries were infected with SARS-coronavirus, resulting 774 deaths. it has been shown that SARS-CoV spike protein plays an important role in receptor recognition, virus attachment and its entry [16]. it represented one of the most important targets for the development of SARS vaccine [6]. antigen-specific IgG1 was also dramatically increased when compared to pci-S alone. the immunization increased antigen-specific IgA response in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells secreted IFN-, TNF-, IL-2, and IL-17 in non-lymphoid tissues such as lung. multi-cytokine producing cells are functionally superior on protection. the gene encoding SARS-CoV spike (S) protein without transmembrane domain (amino acids 14-1154) was synthesized. the sequence was codon optimized for mammalian cell expression. the sequence was replaced with the leader sequence of human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) the cell uptake images were observed by confocal laser scanning microscope. expression of SARS-CoV S was examined in RAW 264.7 cells at both transcriptional and protein level. the cells were transfected with naked pci-S DNA or PEI/pci-S nanoparticles at N/P ratio of 10. five mice per group were immunized i.n. with 20 g of pci-mock, pci-S, or PEI/pci-S complexes in total of 25 l ultrapure water on days 0, 14, 28, and 42. all studies were approved by IACUC at International Vaccine Institute (Seoul, Korea) the absorbance at 450 nm was measured in a microplate reader (Molecular Devices Corp., Menlo Park, CA) the degree of proliferation was detected using flow cytometry, FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences) the percentage of cells with associated fluorescence was determined by using a flow cytometry, FACSCalibur. all cytometric data were analyzed by using a flow cytometry, FACSCalibur. P value less than 0.05 was considered significant. the cells were transfected with naked pci-S DNA or PEI/pci-S nanoparticles at both transcriptional and protein level. the cells were lysed with Trizol or cell lysis buffer [31] five mice per group were immunized i.n. with 20 g of pci-mock, pci-S, or PEI/pci-S complexes. blood was collected from the retro-orbital plexus. color was developed with TMB solution (Sigma) in dark. the reaction was stopped by 0.5 N HCl. spleens were collected after the last vaccination. the cells were stained with anti-CD4-PerCP and anti-CD8-FITC. the percentage of cells with associated fluorescence was determined by using a flow cytometry, FACSCalibur. the authors declare that they have no competing interests. work was supported by the national research foundation (NRF) grants (2010-0003291 and 2010-0027222) funded through the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology, and was conducted as part of the Technology Development Program for agriculture."}
