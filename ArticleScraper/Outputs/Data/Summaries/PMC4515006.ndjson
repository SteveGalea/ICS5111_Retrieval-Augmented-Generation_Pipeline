{"summary": "study aimed to evaluate presence and changes in luminal lung concentrations of the APPs haptoglobin (Hp), lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP), C-reactive protein (CRP) and lactoferrin (Lf) in calves with an acute respiratory disease experimentally induced by Chlamydia (C.) psittaci. [Lf]/[BSA]-quotients decreased during the study in infected animals. concentrations of LBP in blood and BALF as well as the quotient in BALF perfectly paralleled the clinical course of respiratory illness after infection."}
