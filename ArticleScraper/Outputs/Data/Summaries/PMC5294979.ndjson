{"summary": "the virus name was given due to the star-shaped morphology of the virus. EM was the only tool for laboratory diagnostics, as no cell line permissive for a broad range of strains was identified. unbiased high throughput sequencing has identified the unexpected role of astroviruses from a specific clade in human [8,9,10,11,12] and bovine [13] encephalitis. human astroviruses (HAstVs) are found in four MAstV species (MAstV 1, 6, 8, 9) the two other genotypes are closely related to astroviruses from mink, sheep, California sea lions, bats, cattle, pigs, and mice. two species defined by MLB1 (MAstV 6) and VA1 (MAstV 9) strains have been described [16,17] and more recently associated to severe cases of encephalitis in immunocompromised patients. association between astrovirus infection and disease is still being investigated, as well as the interaction of astroviruses with other enteric viruses. virological diagnosis of astrovirus-associated diarrhea is not routinely used in medical practice. but it is sometimes used in epidemiological studies in the context of diarrheal outbreaks [24] and surveillance of diarrheal diseases [25,26]. an astrovirus infection in immunocompromised individuals may induce gastroenteritis, but it can also lead to severe and sometimes fatal systemic and central nervous system infections. astroviruses have been associated with severe avian diseases (i.e., chicken diarrhea, duck hepatitis, turkey enteritis, and avian nephritis) diagnosis can be made in severely affected flocks by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. the first propagation of HAstVs was made possible by Lee and Kurtz in human embryo kidney (HEK) cells through the use of serum medium supplemented in trypsin. the virus has been established in the continuous rhesus monkey kidney cells (LLC-MK2) and in primary baboon kidney cells, but in the absence of cytopathic effect (CPE) the ability to grow astroviruses has simplified the production of antisera in experimental animals, allowing the characterization of serotypes [48] and the development of a radioimmune assay for detection of anti-MAstV 1 (serotypes HAstV 1\u20138) antibodies. further measurement of neutralizing antibodies [50] and the production of astrovirus-specific monoclonal antibodies [51,52,53] have followed. es and claiming good sensitivity and specificity have been commercialized by several companies. but their use and development have been hampered by the advent of molecular diagnostic techniques. RT-PCR has become a very common tool for the diagnosis of astrovirus infection in clinical laboratories. multiplex RT-PCR for Enteric Pathogens Panels has been developed. qPCR can be done using a nucleic acid stain (typically SYBR green) and melting curve analysis. qPCR can be done using a specially designed hydrolysis probe coupled with a fluorophore (typically Taqman) early attempts using either end-point [82,83] or qPCR [84] proved to be as efficient as singleplex PCR for the detection in stool samples of HAstVs, noroviruses, adenoviruses, sapoviruses and enteroviruses. in the latter, the analysis of melting curves allowed the determination of dual-infection by the formation of dual peaks, while being at least 10 more sensitive than end-point PCR. multiplex PCR assay used in parallel to routine assays to detect 11 cases of astrovirus infection among 245 stool samples from pediatric patients [112]. a microfluidic qPCR system based on multiple singleplex TaqMan qPCR assays could quantitatively detect 13 viruses, including human astroviruses, with a sensitivity as low as two copies per microliters. a new format of microarray was designed to detect about 100 viral species associated with gastrointestinal infections in vertebrates. the use of a Virochip allowed the identification of an astrovirus in a domestic rabbit with gastroenteritis after traditional diagnostic approaches failed to identify the pathogen. the advent of high throughput Sequencing (HTS) has opened the way to metagenomics. the use of HTS in research laboratories has allowed a leap forward in the identification and characterization of astroviruses in several species including humans. the primary purpose of many of these studies was not the diagnosis of astrovirus infection in symptomatic situations. however, the use of HTS for routine microbiological diagnosis remains challenging due to the high associated workload and costs. direct EM is complicated by the fact that only a minority of virions exhibit a complete star-shaped structure. Sensitivity of EM is also dependent on elevated concentrations of particles, usually around 107 per gram of stool [37] the use of immune electron microscopy (IEM) techniques using specific antibodies or convalescent sera can improve the sensitivity of the detection. a major advance was made with the ability to grow MAstV 1 in the colonic carcinoma cells (CaCo-2) directly from feces, without prior adaptation to cell culture. adenocarcinoma cell lines appear to be the most commonly used cells to grow wild-type HAstV today. moe et al. developed an RNA-probe hybridization and tested it in parallel to their rapid biotin-avidin EIA. but the sensitivity of the probe assay was high, it did not detect more astrovirus-positive fecal specimens than EIA [55] RT-PCR has become a very common tool for the diagnosis of astrovirus infections in clinical laboratories. however, the design of amplification systems, particularly the intrinsic properties of the primers, are key. some are targeting non-coding regions of the virus in a very sensitive and specific manner. others are designed into conserved motives of the capsid, thereby allowing subsequent typing. qPCR can be done using a nucleic acid stain (typically SYBR green) followed by melting curve analysis, or by the use of a specifically designed hydrolysis probe coupled with a fluorophore (typically Taqman) one-step RT-qPCR methods have also been developed. the filmArray Gastrointestinal Panel (BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA) allows for the simultaneous detection of 22 different enteric pathogens directly from stool specimens. no systematic evaluation of the clinical benefit of the many existing panels has yet been published. several studies have pointed out the advantages to streamline the diagnosis of presumptive infectious diarrhea with the use of a comprehensive multiplex PCR panel. a nanofluidic qPCR assay was used for the detection and quantification of 19 enteric viruses. a nanofluidic qPCR assay demonstrated a sensitivity lower than the limit of detection of conventional RT-qPCR and digital RT-PCR. another technique is based on parallelization of specific probe/target nucleotide hybridization on microarrays and represents an alternative for the detection of several pathogens. a more recent format of microarray was designed to detect about 100 viral species associated with gastrointestinal infections in vertebrates. the use of a Virochip allowed the identification of an astrovirus in a domestic rabbit with gastroenteritis after traditional diagnostic approaches failed to identify the pathogen. d in the discovery of neurotropic astroviruses in humans [8,9,10,11,12,18,27], cattle [136,137,138,139,140,141] and mink [29]. but the use of HTS for routine microbiological diagnosis remains challenging due to the high associated workload and costs. a significant budget per sample is still required. NASBA has shown a good concordance with RT-PCR-based methods for the detection of MAstV 1 (serotypes HAstV 1\u20138). additional primers have been developed and used to describe new populations of viruses. there is not yet a universal pan-astrovirus RT-PCR system. multiplex RT-PCR for enteric pathogens panels have been developed over time. astroviruses, noroviruses, adenoviruses, sapoviruses and enteroviruses have been detected. astroviruses and other gastrointestinal pathogens have been detected by multiplex assays. multiplex PCR assay used in parallel to routine assays to detect 11 cases of astrovirus infection among 245 stool samples from pediatric patients. a microfluidic qPCR system based on multiple singleplex TaqMan qPCR assays could quantitatively detect 13 viruses, including human astroviruses, with a sensitivity as low as two copies per microliters. a new technique is based on parallelization of specific probe/target nucleotide hybridization on microarrays. it represents an alternative for the detection of several pathogens in a single assay. the microarray technology was initially evaluated for the detection of astroviruses and noroviruses in archival stool samples. the advent of HTS has opened the way to metagenomics. it represents a group of disruptive technologies over PCR or other hypothesis-driven detection methods. deep sequencing has the ability to provide more detailed taxonomic information than diagnostic PCRs, and may also be used for the discovery of new pathogens without prior hypothesis. the predominant method for diagnosis in a clinical setting remains RT-qPCR. infection with rare or novel astroviruses will not be detected. the main limitation of RT-qPCR is that infection with rare or novel astroviruses will not be detected."}
