{"summary": "feline coronavirus (FCoV) occurs as two pathotypes, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) and feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), both of which with strains of serotypes I and II. FECV is able to infect monocytes and macrophages, causing systemic infection and fatal disease. clones were used to assess the presence of alterations in the gene 3c in ascites and/or faeces from FIP and healthy cats. clones were used to assess the presence of alterations in the gene 3c in ascites and/or faeces from healthy cats. 3c truncated protein was not observed in 100% of FIPV samples. usP7) showed signs of dry-form FIP (neurological changes) the remaining 4 (USP8, USP16, USP17, and USP18) showed an accumulation of effusion in body cavities (effusive FIP) faecal samples were also obtained from 2 cats (USP2, and USP14) without clinical signs of FIP. 5 L of cDNA was added to 1x PCR buffer (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.25 M of each primer, 1.5 U PlatinumTM Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity. specific bands were excised from the gels and purified using the Gene JetTM Gel Extraction kit. DNA Sequencing Sense primers were designed at approximately every 500 nucleotides to obtain full coverage of genes 3a\u2013c, E, and M. primers for the plasmid (pUC/M13F and R) were also used to reach the full length of the amplicon sequence. only those chromatograms with scores greater than 20 (probability lower than 1 error per 100 nucleotides) were used. final sequences of each sample were obtained using the CAP contig application. intestinal samples were collected including mucosa, submucosa, muscular layer, and serosa. only 2 animals showed signs of dry-form FIP (neurological changes) faecal samples were also obtained from 2 cats (USP2, and USP14) without clinical signs of FIP. cDNA synthesis was performed with 6 L total RNA extracted with TRIzolTM Reagent. 5 L of cDNA was added to 1x PCR buffer (Life Technologies Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA), 2 mM MgSO4, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 0.25 M of each primer, 1.5 U PlatinumTM Taq DNA Polymerase High Fidelity. pGEMTM-T Easy Vector Systems (Promega Madison, WI, USA) and E. coli JM109 competent cells were cloned. transformation culture was plated onto duplicate LB/ampicillin/IPTG/X-Gal plates. plates were incubated overnight (16 hours) at 37\u00b0C and 180 rpm. chromatograms were generated in duplicate for each segment and evaluated for base quality using the online application Phred. only those chromatograms with scores greater than 20 (probability lower than 1 error per 100 nucleotides) were used. final sequences of each sample were obtained using the CAP contig application. sequences obtained from extraintestinal tissue samples and faecal/intestines samples were obtained simultaneously for 3 animals (USP6, USP7, and USP17) with FIP. due to poor sequence quality, not all full length amplicons could be sequenced or used in the analyses. Phylogenetic trees generated for the 3a, 3c, E, and M genes belong to serotype I. clones are present in five different clusters of the 3b tree. clonal diversity was observed in samples from FIP+ and FIP cat. phylogenetic tree constructed using neighbor-joining method. number next to each node represents the values of 1,000 bootstrap repetitions. the scale represents the number of substitutions per site. 99.03 99.50 98.60 99.20 99.20 99.20 99.20 99.20 99.20 99.20 99.77 99.80 99.70 USP7/Cerebrum/PIF+/local3 99.02 100.00 98.10 96.39 100.00 88.10 99.79 100.00 99.70 99.53 100.00 99.50 100.00 100.00 99.54 100.00 99.10 USP16/Cerebrum/ the mean identity between clones from the two cohabitating FIP+ cats ranged from 96.17% (3c gene) to 99.83% (E gene) for tissue and faecal samples, 3a was the most conserved gene (nucleotide identities of 99.38% and 97.70%, resp.) no premature stop codon in the 3a\u2013c or E genes was observed in faecal samples from cats without FIP, with exception of M gene (USP2, 1/6 faeces) faecal samples from cats with or without FIP did not demonstrate this truncated gene in any of the clones. a total of 79 clones belong to serotype I. phylogenetic trees generated for the 3a, 3c, E, and M genes showed similar topologies. in the 3c gene tree, for cats USP6 and USP7, differences can be noticed between the FCoV strains obtained from tissue and faecal clones. however, no generic grouping per pathotype (FECV or FIPV) was observed for all samples and trees generated from this study. clones (FIP+ and FIP) obtained from the 5 genes were 92.09% for faecal samples and 90.09% for tissue samples. the greatest nucleotide diversity when all available sequences for each gene were compared together was observed. the identity between the 3b gene sequences was 97.09%. 10 92.16 100.00 83.30 97.29 100.00 95.50 100.00 100.00 100.00 100.00 99.54 100.00 99.54 100.00 99.10 USP8/UB/PIF+/local6 98.70 99.50 98.50 98.10 99.89 100.00 99.50 99.73 100.00 99.20 USP14/Faeces/PIF/local4 95.86 100.00 91.50 98.96 100.00 3a was the most conserved gene (nucleotide identities of 99.38% and 97.70%, resp.) considering each individual cat. premature stop codons were observed in the 3a\u2013c or E genes. clones of structural (E and M) and accessory (3a\u2013c) genes were obtained from cats with and without FIP. the results demonstrate a highly likely candidate FCoV pathotypic marker in the 3c gene. a single nucleotide transversion (G T) was observed in all clones from samples from this cat. in recent studies, 3c genes with premature termination were detected in faecal and extraintestinal samples from cats with FIP. the role of the truncation in this region on FIP pathogenesis could not be clearly determined, despite it led to lower viral replication in the gut. the difference was 8.84% for the 3b genes, consisting exclusively in point mutations, indicating that this cat could be coinfected with an FCoV strain that is distinct from the systemic strain. however, the high nucleotide identity between samples from the cerebrum and faeces of the cat USP7 (FIP+) showed that the intestinal viral replication of the enteric pathotype may be maintained even during FIP in some cases. clones demonstrated the truncated protein as it was only present in a minority of the sequences observed in the cerebrum of the cat USP16. the transversions observed at position 10 of the 3c gene resulted in premature stop codons."}
