{"summary": "suicide is the result of interactions of biological, individual, and social risk factors in addition to absence of protective factors such as social support. on the basis of this assumption, Zhang[5] suggested that various strain factors influence directly suicide. strain factors involve in the process of strain factors inducing suicide. social factors such as changes in family structure, increased number of related to female workers, self-employed, temporary position workers, reduction in governmental welfare policy, and population aging are important variables affecting suicide. since 2000, the life satisfaction of Korean adults is the lowest among OECD member countries. study tested effects of strain due to individual and social risk factors on suicidality, the indirect effects of strain induced by individual, and social risk factors on suicidality via depressive symptoms. study was performed in august and September 2015. higher total score is related to higher strain due to individual risk factors. 13 items of 11-points scale (not at all anxious = 0 to very anxious = 10) developed by KIHASA[28] were used to measure strain due to social risk factors. social support Five items of 11-point scale (very few = 0 to very many = 10) developed by KIHASA[28] were used. higher total score is related to greater strain due to social risk factors. a confirmatory factor analysis indicated that 4-factor model was superior to 2 and 3-factor model. the fit of 4-factor model was good (Chi-square = 253.68, df = 36, P.001, GFI = 0.993, TLI = 0.984, CFI = 0.989, RMSEA = 0.029) each factor was named. researchers should consider other indices such as GFI, TLI, CFI, and RMSEA together. RMSEA less than 0.08 is acceptable, and 0.05 is considered good. 12 questions of 11-points scale (not at all anxious = 0 to very anxious = 10) developed by KIHASA[28] were used. twelve questions were asked about employment and income (e.g., unemployment, debt, poverty), preparation for old age (e.g., pensions, savings, assets), life safety (e.g., public security, adult entertainment, unpleasant facilities) higher total score is related to higher strain due to individual risk factors. social support Five items of 11-point scale (very few = 0 to very many = 10) developed by KIHASA[28] were used. a confirmatory factor analysis indicated that 2-factor model was superior to 1-factor model. studies-Depression Scale 11 (CESD-11) was used to measure depressive symptoms. this inventory consists of 11 items of 4-point scale (very rare = 0 to mostly = 3) higher scores are related to higher level of depression. 13 items of 11-points scale (not at all anxious = 0 to very anxious = 10) developed by KIHASA[28] were used to measure strain due to individual risk factors. high total score is related to higher strain due to individual risk factors. higher total score is related to higher strain due to individual risk factors. Cronbach alpha for this scale was 0.88. a confirmatory factor analysis indicated that 2-factor model was superior to 1-factor model. the fit of 2-factor model was good. 4-factor model was superior to 2 and 3-factor model. df = 36, P.001, GFI = 0.993, TLI = 0.984, CFI = 0.989, RMSEA = 0.029. depressed mood was first factor, somatic symptom was second factor, happy emotion was third factor. researchers should consider other indices such as GIF, TLI, and RMSEA together. RMSEA less than 0.08 is acceptable, and 0.05 is considered good. we performed Bootstrap with 200 bootstrap samples. strain induced by social risk factors was significantly associated with depressive symptoms. strain due to individual risk factors was positively associated with suicidality. strain due to individual risk factors was positively associated with suicidality. strain associated with social risk factors had indirect effects on suicidality mediating depressive symptoms. the final model accounted for 27.6% of the variance in suicidality. strain due to social risk factors was positively related to more suicidality. social support was negatively associated with strain due to individual risk factors. male reported greater suicidality than female. female reported more depressive symptoms than male. strain due to individual risk factors was significantly associated with suicidality. this study complemented a methodological limitation of previous studies by including various individual risk factors. strain may induce negative emotions such as hopelessness, anger, and frustration. studies have identified the effects of the national economic crisis on depressive symptoms and suicide rate,[20] but no studies have examined the effects of social risk factors on depression and suicide. findings suggest that researchers should consider social risk factors as direct factors rather than secondary factors in understanding suicide in adults. social support negatively associated with strain related to individual risk factors. but contrary to expectations, social support positively affected strain associated with social risk factors. findings suggest that information shared through interactions with others can help to find solutions for individual problems. this study is cross-sectional in nature. there is a limit to clarify the relationships between the variables. it is important to consider individual risk factors and social risk factors together in establishing suicide prevention policies."}
