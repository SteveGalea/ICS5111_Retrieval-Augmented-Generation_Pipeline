{"summary": "influenza A viruses infect primarily freeliving aquatic birds. they are classified by their hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) surface glycoproteins. avian influenza viruses are stable in water 1, 7 and have been isolated from the surface of ponds containing a large number of waterfowl. they are stable in water 1, 7 and have been isolated from the surface of ponds containing a large number of waterfowl. migratory ducks rest and feed for a few days to weeks along the migration route. the length of stay and the aquatic habitat allow the transmission of influenza viruses to and from the domestic duck populations. domestic ducks that become infected are likely to maintain the virus locally and increase the probability of its spread to other species. surveillance studies from multiple areas in North America and in Europe often obtain slightly different prevalence values in the duck populations. many factors can affect prevalence including, but not limited to, the size of the duck population, sampling location, and time of collection. 16 Prevalence is at its lowest during the spring migration but increases again after the breeding season. novel viral genotypes must arise via mutation and reassortment of genomes. each population harbors a potentially different combination of subtypes. ducks that migrate annually are likely to spread influenza viruses along the migration routes. mallard duck embryos inoculated with LPAI viruses have significantly lower mortality rates than inoculated Muscovy duck embryos. the reason for this mortality/virus replication paradox is unclear but is in keeping with the evidence that mallard ducks are considered to be the main reservoir of LPAI viruses in nature. ducks infected with an H4N6 subtype are protected from reinfection with the same virus. but they shed virions for 8 days after challenge with an H11N3 isolate. isolation of influenza virus from migratory waterfowl is infrequent during the winter. pharyngeal excretion suggests that pharyngeal swabs should be taken when conducting surveillance of avian influenza viruses in ducks. pharyngeal excretion suggests that pharyngeal swabs, as well as the customary cloacal swabs, should be taken. mallard duck embryos inoculated with LPAI virus have significantly lower mortality rates than inoculated Muscovy duck embryos. the reason for this mortality/virus replication paradox in mallard ducks is unclear but is in keeping with the evidence that mallard ducks are considered to be the main reservoirs of LPAI viruses. a secondary immune response after inoculation with formalininactivated virus suggested that the rapid immune response in reinfected birds may restrict influenza infection to short time scales. ducks infected with an H4N6 subtype are protected from reinfection with the same virus, but they shed virions for 8 days after challenge with an H11N3 isolate. the data have applications in the field, where isolation of influenza virus from migratory waterfowl is infrequent during the winter. viruses showed severe neurologic signs, including torticollis, incoordination, tremors, and seizures. at least two hypotheses have been proposed, including ascending transmission of virus via vagal, olfactory, and trigeminal nerve fibers. reassortant virus originated from wild ducks or other migratory birds. reassortant virus reemerged multiple times in Hong Kong in 1997. 42 The lys627 mutation has been found to be associated with pathogenicity in mammalian species, 43, 44 suggesting that it may have been generated while the virus was replicating in a mammal. the role of duck species in the westward spread of the QinghaiH5N1 virus remains controversial. most wild duck migrations occur in the northern hemisphere. ducks generally fly north to breed during the summer and return south to spend the winter. live poultry markets (wet markets) have been identified as a risk factor in the genesis of novel influenza viruses 49. the ban on ducks, geese, and later, quail, together with improved biosecurity (clean days) have markedly reduced the influenza virus diversity in the Hong Kong wet markets. in the interim no live poultry can be carried over from 1 day to the next. influenza in humans is considered a noneradicable disease due to periodic introduction of viruses from their natural reservoir, wild migratory birds \u2013 mostly ducks. culling of wild birds is not an option. 37 Between 1999 and 2002, H5N1 HPAI viruses with the H5 HA gene of A/Gs/GD/1/96like viruses reemerged multiple times in Hong Kong. some species, including the RedCrested Pochard, were highly susceptible (19/20 died), while others, including the Bahama Pintail (Anas bahamensis) were less susceptible (4/21 died). 37 H5N1 HPAI viruses have not yet spread from Asia into North America. most wild duck migrations occur in the northern hemisphere, where ducks generally fly north to breed during the summer and return south to spend the winter. the number of human deaths attributed to H5N1 HPAI in the indicated countries (0 indicates infection but no mortality) red marks reports of H5N1 HPAI in poultry; green indicates reports of H5N1 HPAI only in wild birds. the role of live poultry markets in the emergence and control of pandemic influenza has been ignored. universal closure of live markets would make biological sense but is difficult in regions where refrigeration is not widely available. the continued use of vaccines without an eradication plan has immediate benefits but also longterm consequences. the migratory waterfowl of the world (predominantly wild ducks) serve as the natural reservoirs of all influenza A viruses, which cause asymptomatic infection in these birds. unanswered question is whether these migratory bird species are the reservoirs of the currently circulating H5N1 HPAI viruses. all duck species tested to date are susceptible to lethal infection with H5N1 HPAI viruses. some species, including the mallard and Pintail ducks, are less susceptible. surveillance studies have detected no H5N1 HPAI viruses in breeding or juvenile birds. domestic duck population has a higher likelihood of perpetuating H5N1 HPAI viruses. prospective surveillance continues to isolate H5N1 HPAI viruses from healthy ducks, geese, and chickens in 2004\u20132006. the widespread use of vaccine has been used less in geese and ducks. wild ducks are the main reservoir of all influenza A viruses and the ultimate source of future pandemics. members of the scientific community should direct their attention to following questions: do ducks serve as the reservoirs of the Asian H5N1 HPAI viruses. songserm T, Jamon R, SaeHeng N et al.
