{"summary": "the instantaneous reproduction number (19), Rt, can be estimated by the ratio of the number of new infections generated at time step t. it is the average number of secondary cases that a given individual would infect if the conditions remained as they were at time step t. the distinction between and Rt is similar to the distinction between the actual life span of individuals born in 2013. effective control measures undertaken at time t are expected to result in a sudden decrease in Rt and a smoother decrease in (19). effective control measures undertaken at time t are expected to result in a sudden decrease in Rt and a smoother decrease in (19). the precision of these estimates depends directly on the number of incident cases in the time window [t + 1; t] this allows us to control the precision by adjusting the window size. we also provide estimates of Rt, that take into account the uncertainty in the serial interval distribution parameters by integrating over a range of means and standard deviation of the serial interval. we provide a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet that implements the estimation method described above. we have also developed an R package, EpiEstim, which can be downloaded at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html. measles Hagelloch, Germany 1861 Onset of early symptoms 14.9 (3.9) Derived from Groendyke et al. (37)b White, 2008 (17); Fraser, 2011 (20); Frost, 1919 (38); Vynnycky, 2007 (39) Pandemic influenza Baltimore, Maryland 1918 Onset of symptoms 2.6 (1.5) Ferguson et al. (40); Boelle et al. (41) Smallpox Kosovo 1972 Onset of symptoms 22.4 (6.1 the second row shows daily estimates of the instantaneous reproduction numbers Rc over sliding weekly windows. the black lines show the posterior medians and the grey zones show the 95% credible intervals. the black dots show the mean estimates, and the bars show the 95% confidence intervals. estimates then decreased, with R falling below 1 early in week 7. at the very end of the epidemic, the credible intervals widen because of low case numbers. Fraser et al. found a similar temporal trend for R and attributed the decrease in R to social distancing measures. the estimates varied substantially according to the window size chosen. for 4-week windows, the upper credible interval was below 1 at the end of the epidemic. longer intervals delayed the time at which the median estimated R fell below 1. ation, which started on march 16 (day 31) was slow (95% coverage was achieved only by the end of April, around day 70) and sometimes ineffective (26). ation was slow (95% coverage was achieved only by the end of April, around day 70) and sometimes ineffective (26). the highest estimate of Rc is early in the epidemic, on the week ending on day 11, which reflects high transmissibility 2 weeks later. for the measles outbreak in Hallegoch, Germany, the highest estimate of Rc is early in the epidemic, on the week ending on day 11, which reflects high transmissibility 2 weeks later. an initial estimate of R was 1.4 (95% CI: 1.0\u20131.9) at the end of week 2. estimates were then quite stable until R peaked at 2.4 (95% CI: 2.2\u20132.6) in the middle of week 5 (coincident with the second highest peak in incidence) the credible intervals widen because of low case numbers. estimates varied substantially according to the window size chosen. the 1-day window estimates were so variable it was hard to derive any trend from them. longer intervals delayed the time at which the median estimated R fell below 1. R increased from a median value of 3.4 (95% CI: 0.8\u20139.3) early in the fourth week to 23.9 (95% CI: 19.0\u201329.5) in the middle of week 6. then decreased again until the end of the epidemic, falling below 1 only in the beginning of week 8. estimates stayed above 1 until very late in the epidemic, indicating the limited success of control measures. in the last days of the epidemic, 2 new cases appeared, probably as a result of reintroduction of infection from outside the school. estimates of R increased again from a minimum value of 0.2 (95% CI: 0.1\u20130.5) to 0.9 (95% CI: 0.3\u20132.0). the estimates of Rc on weekly windows are smoother than the estimates of R. DISCUSSION We have developed a simple and generic method to estimate time-varying instantaneous reproduction numbers from incidence time series. we applied this method to analyze the time course of transmissibility for 5 historical outbreaks. our estimates of the reproduction number are consistent with estimates of the case reproduction number despite considerable differences in interpretation. ust estimation of R provides important insights into temporal changes in transmission during an epidemic. change can be due to changes in underlying transmissibility (e.g., due to seasonality), changes in contact patterns in the population affected, or the impact of control measures. but just estimating R does not allow us to determine whether this reflects a true reduction in transmissibility. we applied our method to time series of onset of symptoms. we used serial interval distribution as an approximation for the infectivity profile ws. this leads to exact, but time-lagged estimates of the reproduction number. if imported cases were identified as such, our method could easily be adapted to account for them. however, if there were independent data suggesting evidence of changes in the serial interval distribution, our method could be applied with different serial interval distributions for different time periods of the epidemic."}
