{"summary": "polyethylene glycol (PEG) is one of the most versatile polymers synthesized. it consists of repeating units of ethylene oxide, which can be arranged in either linear or branched configurations, creating a series of compounds of different molecular weights with unique properties. a demonstrated lack of immunogenicity, toxicity and antigenicity led to the use of PEG as a key excipient in many pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations. succinimidyl succinate PEG is prepared by reaction of mPEG with succinic anhydride followed by conversion of the carboxylic acid to the succinimidyl ester. this linkage is highly susceptible to hydrolysis after the polymer has been attached to the protein. original PEGylation schemes employed cyanuric chloride to prepare activated PEG for attachment to proteins through multiple nucleophilic functional groups. lysine, one of the most abundant amino acids present in many proteins, was identified as the primary site for attachment of PEG residues. protocols employing these molecules are plagued with the presence of impurities and non-specific attachment to residues, allowing for inconsistencies between production lots. improved second generation PEG chemistries have minimized diol contamination. PEG-iodoacetamide reacts slowly with thiol residues to form a stable thioether bond with proteins which are stable except in a reducing environment when the linkage is converted to a thiol. this process will proceed at a faster rate if the pH is increased. however, under these conditions, PEG-vinyl sulfone may also react with free lysines. complex, branched second generation PEG molecules have also been shown to maintain pH and thermal stability, reduce immunogenicity and protect modified proteins from proteolysis to a much higher degree. the linker used for covalent attachment of PEG must be considered and adopted according to the desired application. intravenous administration of PEGylated ovalbumin (PEG-OVA) suppressed the primary anti-DNP-OVA and anti-OVA IgE responses in both mice and rats. however, injection of unmodified OVA did not alter the ability of the animals to mount IgE responses to DNP-OVA [15] ocytes from animals given several doses of PEGylated compounds to nave animals suggest that PEGylated allergens activate antigen-specific CD8+ suppressor T cells. slowing of antigen processing and extended half-life of the antigen by PEGylation most likely plays a major role in the immunosuppressive capacity of the conjugates. a monomethoxylated form of PEG (mPEG) is generally used for protein conjugation. it contains a single hydroxyl group for activation and an inert methoxy group. this is achieved by substitution of the single hydroxyl group at the end of the PEG molecule by an electrophilic reactive group. this linkage is highly susceptible to hydrolysis after the polymer has been attached to the protein. monomethoxy poly(ethylene) glycol (mPEG) is a branched PEG molecule in which two linear mPEGs activated with either succinimidyl carbonate or benzotriazole are linked to the - and -amino groups of lysine. these molecules offer the advantage of adding two PEG molecules at each attachment site. second generation PEG derivatives have been developed for specific attachment to cysteine residues on proteins and peptides. this compound is not stable in water and the ring is susceptible to opening or addition of water across the double bond. PEGylation processes focus on select amino acids, such as thiol groups on cysteine residues, as primary sites for attachment. enhanced site-specific PEGylation with these reagents minimizes loss of biological activity through enhanced preservation of the native protein structure. tolerization to antigens, Tissues and Cells Davis and Abuchowski were the first to modify two model proteins, bovine serum albumin and liver catalase. mPEG of 1,900 and 5,000 Daltons (Da) were coupled with cyanuric chloride and 2,4,6-trichloro-8-triazine as the coupling agents. this phenomenon was first reported by Lee et al. the degree of suppression depends on the immunological state at the time of treatment, the nature of allergen and the dose. the weakest suppression was observed in mice with high levels of antibodies at the time of treatment. ylation of ovine RBCs can inhibit MHC class II activation and proliferation of T cells, as demonstrated in an in vivo model of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease [31\u201333]. ylation of lymphocytes can inhibit MHC class II activation and proliferation of T cells, as demonstrated in an in vivo model of transfusion-associated graft versus host disease [31\u201333]. therapeutic use of l-asparaginase for acute lymphoblastic leukemia was hindered by frequent intramuscular injections, rendering the enzyme ineffective in many patients. improvements in polymer homogeneity and PEGylation chemistry have produced many potent, well-characterized, protein-based therapeutics. PEGIntron (IFN-2b) contains a single chain 12kDa PEG attached to His34 via a urethane bond. the conjugate is hydrolytically unstable in plasma and when stored at ambient temperatures. despite their differences, both products have greater anti-viral action than their native counterparts. the increase in size minimizes renal clearance of the drug, prolongs circulation time and stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of neutrophils. the increase in size allows the molecule to preferentially accumulate in inflamed tissue, where its therapeutic effect is primarily needed. cellular targets and immune responses to both the vector selected for gene transfer and the transgene product were the primary reasons for applying PEGylation technology to gene delivery vectors. in this regard, PEGylation was initially used for non-viral vectors and eventually for viral vectors as the immune response became the most significant limitation to therapeutic gene transfer. covalent modification of proteins contained in the virus coat with PEG has been shown to improve both the physicochemical and biological properties of several recombinant viruses used for gene transfer. 66 in vivo SSPEG and TMPEG improved gene transduction in the lung without compromising transduction efficiency in the liver and muscle. 68 in vivo PEGylation extended the circulation half-life by a factor of 5. 68 in vivo PEGylation improved transduction efficiency in the bone marrow and in the spleen 14 days after systemic administration of virus. adenovirus is an otherwise highly efficient vector for gene transfer. the virus enters cells through several receptors (integrins, heparan sulfate proteoglycans and the coxsackie- and adenovirus receptor (CAR). this leads to non-specific transgene expression and undesired side effects. modified virus during storage at 20, 4, 25 and 42 \u00b0C for extended periods of time. modification prevented virus aggregation within the acidic environment created during degradation of the microspheres. zeta potential analysis revealed that PEGylation reduces the negative charge of the virus capsid from 48 mV (unmodified, native virus) to 28, 24 and 16 mV when conjugated to TMPEG, SSPEG and CCPEG. changes in particle size of the virus have been found to correlate with degree of modification. properties of individual capsid proteins can be measured by changes in the placement of a peak and/or peak size (Figures 6 and 7) and sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) with barium iodide staining. the changes in molecular weight associated with the new PEG-conjugate will improve the accuracy of the chemical profiles of PEGylated viruses. RP-HPLC Chromatograms Showing Peaks of (A) Free PEG; (B) PEGylated adenovirus (50% modification as determined by CE and fluorescamine assays; (C) Unmodified Adenovirus and (D) PEGylated adenovirus (100% modification) Viral proteins were separated on a Jupiter column (250 4 mm) packed with a 5 m diameter, 300 pore size C4 resin (Phe adenovirus boiled and run on 10% polyacrylamide gels with standard molecular weight markers (Lane 1 gel A) at 30 volts overnight. gel could be cut in half and stained with coomassie Brilliant Blue (Gel A) or a 5% barium chloride/1M iodine in 0.01 M perchloric acid (Gel B) adenoviruses linked to 5 kDa PEG at a ratio of 90% and 100% were 6.4 and 22 min respectively. circulating genome levels of virus modified with 35 kDa PEG were more than 10 fold higher than those of unmodified virus at both early (10 minutes) and later (24 hours) times after systemic administration in mice. removal of adenovirus from bloodstream and rapid uptake in the liver after intravenous injection is caused by non-specific charge-mediated interactions with proteins and cells. adenovirus preferentially accumulates in the liver and the spleen in rodent models and non-human primates when given systemically. adenoviruses were pre-incubated with heparin for 1 hour at 37 \u00b0C. binding was allowed to take place for 1 hour at 4 \u00b0C prior to the replacement of virus with culture medium. values are representative of three separate experiments. the average diameter of fenestrae of a mouse and a baboon is similar. the number of fenestrae in the baboon liver is less than that of the mouse. this may explain reduced hepatic transduction efficiency of virus modified by high molecular weight PEGs at high PEG densities reported in mice. a significant drop in platelet counts from 1,644 103/L to 770 103/L was observed in mice at three days after administration of unmodified helper-dependent virus. steric hindrance associated with the polymer prevents interaction with platelets, which in turn disrupts the clotting cascade. unmodified and PEGylated helper-dependent virus returned to baseline within 72 hours in a baboon given virus. platelets remained low throughout the study in an animal given unmodified virus. the humoral immune response is characterized by production of antibodies which rapidly clear the virus from the circulation and prevent successful gene transfer upon readministration. immunosuppression with agents such as cyclophosphamide, FK506 and cyclosporin A have effectively blunted the immune response. the disruption of costimulatory interactions between T cells and B cells using interferon-, IL-12, anti-CD40 ligand antibody or CTLA4Ig [124\u2013127] have effectively blunted the immune response and extended the length of transgene expression. cytokine release profiles in first generation and helper-dependent viruses reduced cytokine levels as early as 2 and 4 hours after treatment. IL-6 levels were also found to be reduced by approximately 70% in non-human primates given a single intravenous dose of 3 1012 vp/kg dose of adenovirus. protein-1 (MIP-1), interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX) were significantly reduced in mice after tail vein injection of PEGylated virus. neutrophil infiltration in the livers of these mice was reduced by a factor of 2 with respect to those given unmodified virus. transgene expression was extended from 14 to 28 days after a single intravenous injection of PEGylated virus in the mouse. it is likely that the polymer alters processing and presentation of viral antigens, preventing T cells from recognizing viral epitopes. several reports have described unsuccessful readministration of virus in mice treated with virus modified by the same PEG chemistry. viral vectors are extremely efficient at inducing transgene expression in cellular targets. covalent modification of proteins contained in the virus coat with PEG has been shown to improve both the physicochemical and biological properties of several recombinant viruses used for gene transfer. 66 Lentivirus in vitro Transduction efficiency of PEGylated virus was not compromised in the presence of neutralizing antibodies PEGylation provided a 20 fold resistance to antiserum. 68 in vivo PEGylation extended circulation half-life by a factor of 5. recombinant adenoviruses can infect both dividing and non-dividing cells. they have the capacity to accommodate large DNA inserts. their clinical use is significantly hindered by strong innate and adaptive immune responses against viral proteins. titer was due to extensive cross-linking of the polymer with multiple virus capsids. each of these preparations maintained titers that were significantly higher than unmodified virus during storage at 20, 4, 25 and 42 \u00b0C for extended periods of time. this modification prevented virus aggregation within the acidic environment created during degradation of the microspheres. PEGylation reduces the negative charge of the virus capsid from 48 mV (unmodified, native virus) to 28, 24 and 16 mV when conjugated to TMPEG, SSPEG and CCPEG. changes in particle size of the virus have been found to correlate with degree of modification. an avidin-horseradish peroxidase detection system uses an avidin-horseradish peroxidase detection system. paired assays with other analytical techniques such as capillary zone electrophoresis and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) with barium iodide staining allows one to visualize specific virus proteins linked to PEG. Virus was detected at 214 nm. the Y axis represents absorbance units and the X axis minutes until a preparation eluted from the capillary. unmodified (Lanes 4 and 5 both gels) and PEGylated (Lanes 2 and 3 both gels) adenovirus were boiled and run on 10% polyacrylamide gels with standard molecular weight markers (Lane 1 gel A) at 30 volts overnight. when electrophoresis was complete, the gel could be cut in half and stained with coomassie Brilliant Blue (Gel A) or a 5% barium chloride/1M i adenoviruses linked to 5 kDa PEG at a ratio of 90% and 100% were 6.4 and 22 min respectively, whereas that of unmodified Ad had a calculated half life of 1.9 min in mice. circulating genome levels of adenovirus modified with 35 kDa PEG were more than 10 fold higher than those of unmodified virus. AUC CL Half-life PEG size 3.4 kDa 5 kDa 5 kDa 20 kDa Degree of modification - - 30% 60% 90% 100% 45% Fold change in Pharmacokinetic parameter 12 4 1.3 2 3 22 25 Removal of adenovirus from bloodstream is caused by non-specific charge-mediated interactions with proteins and cells. it is also known that adenovirus preferentially accumulates in the liver and the spleen in rodent models and studies in rodents have suggested that PEGylated virus retains its liver transduction efficiency by entering cells via heparan sulfate proteoglycan receptors (HSPGRs) the primary means by which the virus enters hepatocytes in vivo, and interacts with blood factors including protein C (PC), factor VII (FVII), factor IX (FIX) and factor X (FX) differences in liver fenestration and binding properties of platelets and other blood components with modified virus may attribute to this finding in non-human primates. the smaller size and lower density of fenestrae may be anatomical barriers for hepatocyte transduction in non-human primates. adenovirus-associated toxicity can be reduced in non-human primates. a reduction in uptake of the virus in the spleen and subsequent drop in cytokine release is responsible for the improved toxicity profile of PEGylated vectors in this animal model. a 40% reduction in platelets was noted in baboons 6 hours after administration of 3 1012 vp/kg of both unmodified and PEGylated helper-dependent virus. this transient drop returned to baseline within 72 hours in a baboon given unmodified virus while platelets remained low throughout the study. the immune response Most of the toxicity associated with recombinant adenoviruses arises from the innate and adaptive immune response against the immunosuppression with agents such as cyclophosphamide, FK506 and cyclosporin A have effectively blunted the immune response and extended the length of transgene expression. these approaches were deemed unsuitable in practice since they impair immunity to other microbes and produce serious unwanted side effects. the most striking finding of these studies was that administration of PEGylated virus to mice previously exposed to unmodified virus produced transgene expression levels equivalent to those found in nave animals. the most striking finding of these studies was that administration of PEGylated virus to mice previously exposed to unmodified virus produced transgene expression levels equivalent to those found in nave animals. hepatic gene expression of monocyte chemo-attractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2), interferon-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and lipopolysaccharide-induced CXC chemokine (LIX) was significantly reduced in mice after tail vein injection of PEGylated virus. in vitro mechanistic studies revealed that macrophages infected with PEGylated virus failed to transgene expression was extended from 14 to 28 days after a single intravenous injection of PEGylated virus in the mouse. it is likely that the polymer alters processing and presentation of viral antigens, preventing T cells from recognizing viral epitopes. several reports have described unsuccessful readministration of virus in mice treated with virus modified by the same PEG chemistry. systemic administration of adenovirus conjugated with 5 kDa PEG at a density of 90% increased transgene expression by a factor of 35 in tumor bearing mice. increased transgene expression by a factor of 35 in tumor bearing mice and reduced transgene expression in the liver by 7%. characterization suggested that vectors modified with large molecular weight polymers would indeed be useful in the treatment of cancer. bifuntional molecules were evaluated for their ability to link the virus to tissue and cell-specific ligands. modification of the virus with PEG and a peptide specific for differentiated ciliated airway epithelial cells improved transduction efficiency in this target fourfold. RGD-PEG-Ad showed higher levels of gene expression in both CAR-positive and -negative cells. modifications dampened CAR-mediated infection of target cells. additional improvements in gene transfer to endothelial cells in mice with delayed-type hypersensitivity and human breast cancer cells have been achieved. modification of the virus with PEG and a peptide specific for differentiated ciliated airway epithelial cells improved transduction efficiency in this target fourfold. similar findings were reported with PEGylated vectors conjugated with fibroblast growth factor (FGF) both in vitro and in vivo. adenoviruses have been successfully used as carriers for recombinant DNA-based vaccines. adenoviruses have been successfully used as carriers for recombinant DNA-based vaccines. adenoviruses have been successfully employed as carriers for recombinant DNA-based vaccines. unmodified and PEGylated vectors can induce stronger anti-antigenic immune responses against an encoded antigen. the exact mechanisms by which these vectors with a reduced immunogenic profile can induce strong anti-antigenic immune responses are currently unknown. there are very few studies that determine the exact mechanism by which PEGylation blunts the anti-adenovirus immune response. some studies using modified vectors for vaccination purposes suggest that the immune response against the encoded antigen is due to an increase in uptake and processing of the vector."}
