{"summary": "patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbation were recruited and classified as elderly (>65 years) and non-elderly (65 years). PCR for respiratory viruses and cultures for common pathogens were performed. the relationship between older age and infections cannot be easily evaluated since limited data exist concerning specific conditions (e.g. severe community acquired pneumonia, nosocomial bacteremia) or subpopulations (postoperative patients) within the elderly [2]. up to date most of the efforts are small single center cohorts that have tried to study elderly patients together with specific characteristics and risk factors associated with certain infection. the age cut off chosen for this study was based on the world health organisation definition for elderly. most developed world countries have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of \"elderly\" or older person. most developed countries have accepted the chronological age of 65 years as a definition of \"elderly\" patients with mild COPD (stage I) had an FEV1/FVC70% and FEV1 between 50% and 80% of predicted values. patients with severe COPD (stage IV) had an FEV1/FVC70% and FEV1 between 30% and 50% of predicted values. patients with very severe COPD (stage IV) had an FEV1/FVC70% and FEV130% of predicted values. viral DNA/RNA was extracted by using 200l of clinical sample mixed with lysis buffer. centrifugation was performed at 13000 rpm for 20 min followed by removal of supernatant. pellet was resuspended with 1000l 70% ethanol followed by centrifugation for 15 min. the conjugate binds via streptavidin with the biotin present in the amplified products. in the presence of o-dianisidine, the peroxidase activity of the conjugate induces the appearance of an insoluble product which precipitates at the hybridization sites of the AT. chi-square or Fisher\u2019s exact test were used for comparisons of proportions. 65 years as a definition of \"elderly\" or older person. there is no standard numerical criterion, but the u.n. agreed to a cutoff of 60+ years. all patients underwent routine blood examination, including C- reactive protein. the method is able to detect and characterize the 17 most frequent types of human viruses responsible for respiratory infections. it uses a sequence which corresponds to a highly preserved region within the viral genome and binding probes specific to each respiratory virus type. the molecular procedure was performed according to manufacturer\u2019s instructions. the amplified products are labeled with biotin during the PCR. they are incubated with a streptavidin-peroxidase conjugate. the conjugate binds via streptavidin with the biotin present in the amplified products. altogether 247 patients were considered suitable to be analyzed. 81(32.8%) patients were 65 (585.99) years old and 166 (67.2%) 65 (74.84.8) years old (p0.001) Demographics of all recruited patients shown in Table 1. 69.39.5 58 5.99 74.84.8 0.001 Sex (Males) 191 (77.3) 59 (72.8) 132 (79.5) 0.2 Oxygen therapy 112 (45.3) 27 (33.3) 85 (51.2) 0.08 Influenza vaccination 112 (45.3) 17 (21) 95 (57) 0.001 Pack years 6240.66 61.639.02 62.141.5 0.6 COPD (years) 6.26.37 4.75.07 7.046.7 N=133 (100%) Patients 65 Years N=40(30%) Patients >65 Years N=93(70%) p Values Age (years) 57.55.7 75.35.1 0.001 Sex (Males) (%) 26 (65) 71 (76) 0.2 Oxygen therapy (%) 12(30) 50(53.7) 0.05 Influenza vaccination (%) 5(12.5) 56(63.4) 0.001 Pack years 58.842.6 55.238.8 0.4 COPD (year the detected viruses in order of frequency were human Respiratory Syncytial Virus (hRSV) subtypes A and B [n= 108 (81.2%)], influenza virus type A, B and C [n=34 (25.5%)], parainfluenza virus (hPIV) sybtypes 3 and 4 [n=26 (19.5%)], rhinovirus [n=17 (12.8%)], human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) subtypes A and B [ the most commonly isolated bacteria were Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Haemophilus influenzae, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumanii and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. hRSVA 61 15 46 0.1 hRSVB 65 21 44 0.9 hRSV total 108 32 76 0.9 Influenza A 11 3 8 0.6 Influenza B 14 statistically significant difference was evident in seasonal pattern of RSV infection (both subtypes-p=0.001, p=0.029), hPIV3 (p=0.003), hPIV4 infection (p0.001) and influenza virus infection (all the subtypes) (p=0.009, p=0.023, p=0.049 respectively) double viral infection 18 (25.3) 16 (19.7) 9 (32.1) 20 (29.9) 0.5 hRSVA, B =human Respiratory Suncytial Virus A and B, hPIV3,4=human Parainfluenza Virus type 3, 4= human Metapneumovirus type A.
