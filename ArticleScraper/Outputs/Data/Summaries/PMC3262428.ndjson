{"summary": "data collected during field outbreak investigations are essential to better understand the clinical and epidemiological features of an infectious disease. they can also provide useful insights for outbreak management and control. evaluating the risk factors governing transmission is important to design efficient control measures, and identify those individuals that are most at risk of infection. alternative approach is to reconstruct the transmission tree and derive important summary statistics from it. this may give greater flexibility (for example, there is no need to specify time intervals with constant transmission rates), potentially at the cost of larger variance of the estimates [15,18]. transmission model, dependency and computational times Assume that we observe the spread of a disease in a population of size N from day 0 to day T. each individual i = 1,..., N, let if individual i is infected between 0 and T; 0 otherwise. transmission models For a direct transmitted disease, the first step to estimate transmission risk factors is usually to propose a model for transmission hazard from case i to subject j on day t. the transmission hazard may depend on: the time lag t\u2013ti between day t and the day of infection ti of case i since infectiousness of. the functional form between and t\u2013ti will depend on the assumed natural history of the disease. for example, some subjects may be more infectious while others are more susceptible. the contact rate might depend on whether subjects live in the same household or go to the same school, etc. we model the transmission hazard between a case and a susceptible individual in the population by: 3.1 where the specific effect of xk on the transmission hazard is measured by function. the total hazard of infection for individual j on day t is then: 3.2. the first term of equation (3.2) only involves disease cases. the second term characterizes the probability of escaping infection up to time t. data needs for inference reduce to: \u2014 \u2018case data\u2019; table of sufficient statistics that characterize the interaction of cases with any individual of the population. a,b is the Kronecker delta or identity function (=1 if a = b and 0 otherwise) Equation (3.2) has important implications in terms of computational speed. the first term of equation (3.2) only involves disease cases; the second term characterizes the probability of escaping infection up to time t. a source of infection rj can be drawn from its distribution for each case j. this gives a sample of M transmission trees drawn from their predictive distribution. the method formalizes those introduced in work undertaken in 2001 on the UK FMD epidemic. for each case j, compute probabilities given n1 (equation 4.1; see appendix A) and for x in, compute the expected number of transmission events of type and \u2014 conditional maximization step: for k = 1,..., K, and for j = 1,..., Lk: maximize LC with respect to other parameters being fixed. for each parameter value in the sample m = 1,...,M, a source of infection rj can be drawn from its distribution for each case j. this gives a sample of M transmission trees drawn from their predictive distribution. the method formalizes those introduced in work undertaken in 2001 on the UK FMD epidemic of that year [13]. the EM algorithm when the days of infection are observed. for each case j, compute probabilities given n1 (equation 4.1; see appendix A), for each case j, draw the source rj of case j from distribution. for x in, compute the expected number of transmission events of type and. conditional maximization step. equation: (H1) Given the day of symptoms onset sj, infectiousness over time is independent of the day of infection tj. this is, for example, the case if infectiousness starts with symptom onset. this is, for example, the case if infectiousness starts with symptom onset. given n1 (equation 4.1; see appendix A), for each case j, draw the source rj of case j from distribution, and for x in, compute the number of transmission events of type x. the augmented likelihood is slightly different from the case when days of infection are known (equation 3.2). the transmission hazard between case farm i and susceptible farm j is modelled as a function of the following characteristics. the multiplicative term on the transmission hazard is if case farm is a sheep farm, if it is a small farm and 1 if it is a cattle farm. transmission kernel is the step function: interval 0\u20132000 km is partitioned in 250 intervals of length 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 km between 0\u20135, 5\u201315, 15\u201365, 65\u2013165, 165\u2013415, 415\u2013815, 815\u20131015 and 1015\u20131415 km respectively.

\u2014 infectivity profile from symptom onset of case i\u2014modelled with a normalized discretized exponential distribution with a in the simulated outbreak, there were a total of 1842 cases with 631 (34%) child cases. figure 3 shows how estimates change in real-time. on day 20, only 31 cases have been detected and credible intervals of parameters are therefore wide. when only 50 per cent of cases in the community and in hospitals are detected, precision of estimates starts to break down. this is not true of estimates of transmission rates in small closed settings such as households (electronic supplementary material, figure S2). we have presented strategies to tackle some of the challenges associated with the estimation of transmission characteristics of infectious diseases. the dependency that is typically observed in outbreak data can potentially lead to long computational times. discretization reduced computational time from few weeks to few minutes. the EM algorithm does not suffer from that problem on small datasets. it can be used in small datasets and when dates of infection are missing. but it requires extra work to tune the variance of the Metropolis-Hastings proposals. estimates of relative infectivity were particularly sensitive to under-reporting. it is likely estimates would be less robust to under-reporting, if reporting rates changed over time. analysis of outbreak data is subject to many other challenges. a key limit on the more widespread use of the type of methods presented in this paper is the relatively high technical hurdle to implement them. a key limit on the more widespread use of the type of methods presented in this paper is the relatively high technical hurdle to implement them. the population is partitioned in Ck groups on the basis of risk factor k. the multiplicative term associated with risk factor k in equation (2.4) is: \u2014 the force of infection exerted on individuals is relatively small so that the log-likelihood simplifies to equation (4.4) conditional on the fact that individual j has not been infected up to day t, the probability that individual j is infected on day t is equal to. conditional on the day tj of infection, the probability that case i is the case source is: and A.2. hypothesis H1 implies that one only needs the sequence of symptom onset dates to reconstruct the risk individual j was exposed to and Given sj, St, the probability that case j is infected on day t is therefore:"}
