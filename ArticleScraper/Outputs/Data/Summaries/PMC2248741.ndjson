{"summary": "cDNA pathogen arrays derived from reference strain nucleic acids have been replaced by oligonucleotide arrays due to their increased flexibility. oligonucleotide arrays have been used to design probes for clinically important virus genera. a comprehensive viral microarray should address the entire viral sequence database. protein-protein comparisons are more sensitive for detecting conserved regions due to the power of substitution matrices. at the time of writing, no reported oligonucleotide design algorithm leverages this information. the protein familys database is a repository of hand curated protein multiple alignments and Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) across all phylogenetic kingdoms. probe-template mismatches allowed prediction of probe-viral hybrid strength and correlation to fluorescence data. the change in Gibbs free energy at 65\u00b0C was calculated using PairFold version 1.7 (27) as separate measure of probe-template binding strength. the final dataset contained 281 632 nucleic acid sequences. taxon growth was estimated using a standard least squares method. a non-redundant database comprising 74 044 sequences was generated with CD-Hit. the most conserved regions within homologous genes were identified for probe design. sequence clusters were subjected to a MEME motif search (34) using the following parameters: motif width of 20, zero or one motif allowed per sequence, a minimum of two sequences per motif. the algorithm considered a probe to be \u2018covering\u2019 if it had 5 mismatches to the template. a greedy algorithm was implemented to choose a probe combination from the matrix. candidate probes were further screened to ensure a Tm >60\u00b0C. west Nile virus RNA (WNV, strain New York 1999, AF202541) was used as template in hybridization experiments on an Agilent oligonucleotide array. Approximately one third of the probes had between 1 and 20 randomly introduced mismatches. a volume containing 106 copies of WNV and 200 ng of background nucleic acid was amplified using random primers. EMBL nucleotide sequence database was chosen as reference for this study because it is tightly integrated with the Pfam protein family database (23,32). we incorporated all viral genomes in the NCBI Reference Sequence (RefSeq) project on 21 May 2007 (1701 unique viruses; 2790 genome segments) the most conserved, non-overlapping 20 amino acid (aa) regions were identified. in the second step, protein alignments of all Pfam-A families were extracted. sequences annotated as 5\u2032 UTR, 3\u2032 UTR, LTR, and those without annotation were first clustered at the 80% threshold. clustered sequences were then subjected to a motif search using the same parameters employed for proteins. genome tiling probes are evenly distributed among viral families. we chose 60 nt oligonucleotides end-to-end along all viral genomic RefSeq sequences. this resulted in a tiling probe-set where the length of a sequence was proportional to the number of interrogating probes. project (38) has catalogued 1701 viral strain representatives. of the 275 known viral genera, nearly all had at least one genome. all genera containing vertebrate pathogens had at least one fully sequenced genome. the current database comprised 74 044 unique sequence representatives at the 98% similarity level. however, growth in diversity has been more modest. we charted the growth of viral taxonomic groups as a function of time to visualize trends in viral discovery. the mismatch threshold was determined based on experiments with west Nile virus (strain new york 1999, AF202541) that indicated high, homogenous fluorescence signal was observed if probes had five or fewer mismatches. the most recent EMBL/Pfam release comprised 9318 families. of 405 543 annotated protein sequences with length >20 aa, 278 119 (68.6%) belonged to a Pfam-A family. of sequences not contained in Pfam-A, only 5.6% were found in Pfam-B alignments. probe-target thermodynamics have been successfully modeled to predict fluorescence (41,42), control for variance (43) and even estimate concentrations of target detected in samples (44). we computed the change in Gibbs free energy (G) for all expected probe-viral nucleic acid pairs in the west Nile virus hybridization experiments described above. probes of 60 nt were designed end-to-end along the entire genome for all 1701 Reference Sequence viral strains available as of May 2007. the tiling probe set served as a contrast to our design method since it was based on nucleic acid sequence, had more probes per gene, required less computation, and included viruses. 124 100.0 122 98.4 Baculoviridae 414 40 408 98.6 249 60.1 Barnaviridae 1 1 1 100.0 1 100.0 Bicaudaviridae 2 2 100.0 2 100.0 Birnaviridae 284 12 284 100.0 255 89.8 Bornaviridae 22 1 22 100.0 22 100.0 Bromoviridae 475 72 472 99.4 409 86.1 Bunyaviridae hypoviridae 34 4 34 100.0 21 61.8 Inoviridae 23 23 23 100.0 23 100.0 23 100.0 Iridoviridae 104 8 103 99.0 61 58.7 Leviviridae 9 9 9 100.0 9 100.0 Lipothrixviridae 5 2 5 100.0 2 40.0 Luteoviridae 172 18 172 100.0 154 89.5 Marnaviridae 1 1 1 100.0 1 100.0 Microvirid only 49% (1701 of 3441) of viral species have a fully sequenced representative genome. tiling-based probe-sets included species lacking representative genomes. dominated by gene fragments Sequence information has grown rapidly since advent of modern capillary sequencing techniques. the high number of retroviral sequences reflects the importance of HIV-1 gag and pol gene sequences in clinical management of HIV infection. s HIV-1 and highly redundant HIV-1 sequences represent 44% of the current EMBL viral database. 83% of these sequences are less than 1 kb in length. a viral microarray that mirrored the database would oversample HIV and undersample other viruses. a tiered, protein-motif-based approach to probe design addresses all viral sequences Nucleotide sequences were divided into four subtypes: (i) coding sequences that corresponded to Pfam-A alignments (cPf), (ii) coding sequences that were not in the Pfam-A alignments (cNPf), (iii) sequences that were annotated as untranslated regions (UTR) or long terminal repeats (LTR total nucleic acid was amplified, labeled and hybridized. the EMBL viral database is clustered with a threshold of 98% nucleotide identity to create a non-redundant sequence database. ed 4616 unannotated sequences were processed with a sliding window strategy. 14 530 probes were designed. the number of probes required to address all viral sequences was 270 866. probe-virus hybrids with free energy \u201332.5 kJ had high fluorescence. this value was chosen as the threshold to classify a probe as likely to generate a strong signal when the cognate viral target is present. database coverage was gauged by computing probe-template G for all 74 044 unique sequence representatives. database coverage using the tiling method was 47.8% and required 850 136 probes; coverage using the motif-based method was 99.7%.
