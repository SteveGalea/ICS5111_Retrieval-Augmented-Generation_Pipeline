{"summary": "the majority of data addressed tuberculosis (1,417 data points; 64.1%), followed by RSV (285; 12.9%), SARS-Coronavirus (198; 9.0%) and influenza (84; 3.8%), pneumonia (172; 7.8%), and pneumonia (172; 7.8%), while the rest were on other respiratory infections such as otitis media and bronchitis (53; 2.4%). we performed a total of 515 disease susceptibility meta-analysis in all four genetic models. only two genes retained noteworthiness for the mid/low BFDP level. the first was IL4 gene, for pooled result in allelic model. we identified a total of 19 family and linkage-based studies, which were not included in the meta-analysis due to methodological restraints. we also identified 11 GWAS studies; seven were on tuberculosis, three on otitis media and one on influenza. majority of previously published meta-analyses were based on one pathogen. only a handful of published studies compared different respiratory tract diseases. majority of previously published meta-analyses were based on one pathogen - one polymorphism approach. ella pneumophila had increased mortality rates compared to controls36. this was the single result that was significant in pooled analyses, and marginal in disease-specific meta-analyses. this reflects the need for studies with more statistical power, but also suggests that this is one of the most likely translatable results towards clinical application across the wider spectrum of respiratory infectious diseases. the best way forward is through improvement of primary studies and reduction of research waste. the association of tuberculosis with SLC11A1 was replicated in two studies51,52, with a notable exception in the third one. the results of this study fit into previously implied mechanisms of respiratory infections. despite differences described from in vitro and in vivo studies, this could be the most interesting translatable mechanism towards clinical medicine. despite differences described from in vitro and in vivo studies, this could be the most interesting translatable mechanism towards clinical medicine. the use of novel molecular technologies, various omics, and their application to infectious disease development, progression and outcome (infect-omics) presents an unprecedented opportunity in this field73. however, these must be based on evidence-based, always include estimates of repeatability and focus on replication efforts in an unlinked population. systematic reviews need to compare disease-specific genes and pathways to disease-specific genes. results must be viewed in light of numerous limitations. existence of wider-scale unpublished data and occasionally our inability to obtain raw data present another possible source of bias. despite all these limitations, we attempted to provide a field synopsis. results are just the first step it an attempt to provide a reflection of just one side of the infectious disease story \u2013 the host. only by combining host genomics (and other \u2013omics) information with pathogen \u2013omics will we truly advance this field. this led to identification and exclusion of a total of 23,677 studies. the remaining 881 articles were supplemented by hand search of their references. the remaining 881 articles were supplemented by hand search of their references. a total of 142 e-mails were sent to authors of studies which we classified as having reported insufficient information. this entire process results in a total of 10 responses (4 rejections, 2 responses that did not meet the inclusion criteria and 4 cases of clarifications or shared raw data. all data points were classified according to the underlying research question. we defined a subset of methodologically better studies, where controls were of known exposure to the pathogen. study may be prone to three main domains of errors and bias. data points that failed HWE test at the level of P 0.05 were downgraded to C in the CSI score. in such instances we assigned 0 to selection bias risk. in such instances we assigned 0 to selection bias risk. analyses for all SNPs where four or more data points were available for a single SNP. we used random effects meta-analysis, assuming differences in designs and ethnic composition of individual studies. we also calculated fixed-effects model, in order to compare results. 1,001\u201310,000 graded as B, and over 10,001 graded as A. third score domain was fixed as C (weak credibility) due to very prevalent risk of bias in primary studies. a set of 1,146 articles were read in full and screened against inclusion criteria. the study selection process was based on iterative steps. first, the studies needed to report the number of cases and controls for every analysed genotype. a total of 142 e-mails were sent to authors of studies which we classified as having reported insufficient information. we also contacted all authors of identified GWAS studies to share their results. this entire process results in a total of 10 responses (4 rejections, 2 responses that did not meet the inclusion criteria and 4 cases of clarifications or shared raw data. we developed a novel score for purposes of risk of bias assessment. a study may be prone to three main domains of errors and bias. the elements of the score were developed on the basis of several previous studies. y-Weinberg test for every control set included in the analysis, using a two tailed chi-square test or an exact test, when appropriate. those data points that failed HWE test at the level of P 0.05 were downgraded to C in the CSI score. in such instances we assigned 0 to selection bias risk, as there was no selection process involved. we used bayesian false-discovery probability (BFDP)72. it was calculated for nominally significant results only, with a threshold of 0.2. the advantage of this approach over the commonly used corrections is that it is not dependent on the number of tests performed. of
