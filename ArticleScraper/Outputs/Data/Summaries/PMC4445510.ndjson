{"summary": "pancreatitis is now recognized as a common entity in cats (4\u20136). the specific feline pancreatic lipase (Spec fPL) assay and pancreatic ultrasonography are widely regarded as the most useful antemortem diagnostic tests (6\u20138) serum and plasma samples have identified several proteins that may act as biomarkers for diagnosing and differentiating between pancreatitis and pancreatic carcinoma in humans (15\u201317). only a limited number of proteomic studies have been conducted in cats, concentrating on the urine proteome, degenerative joint disease, and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (1,2,18,19).
