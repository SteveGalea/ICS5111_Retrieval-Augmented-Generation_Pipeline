{"summary": "the ineffectiveness of human immunodeficiency virus vaccines has refocused efforts on the elicitation of antibodies with immunogens. some HIV type 1 (HIV-1)-infected individuals make antibodies with unusually broad, potent neutralizing activity (33) a study of 10,000 protein sequences showed that the number of glycosylation sites on HIV-1 gp120 ranks in the top 10 for the extent of this kind of modification. on gp120 have been rigorously shown to shield epitopes that would otherwise be the target of neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) there is only one antibody (P2D2) whose epitope maps to the underlying sequences (8, 37) rhesus macaques experimentally infected with mutants lacking two or three of the N-linked sites in gp41. animal 323-92, a rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta) infected with SIVmac239-gp41/g23. animal showed high neutralizing titers in plasma against this carbohydrate mutant virus (SIVmac239-gp41/g23) and virus lacking all three glycosylation sites. immunoglobulin G (IgG)-expressing cells were sorted with anti-IgG magnetic beads (Miltenyi Biotec Inc., Auburn, CA) the IgG+ cell fraction was spinoculated with supernatant containing rhesus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-like herpesvirus. tCD40L cells mimic bacterial DNA and stimulate B cells via toll-like receptors. tCD40L cells were gamma irradiated the day before spinoculation at 5 105 cells/ml for 50 min, for a total dose of 96 Gy. the mixture of feeder and rhesus cells was incubated as described above, replacing one-half of the medium once per week. supernatants were then screened by standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for reactivity against a synthetic peptide corresponding to antibodies 4G8, 6G8, and 7D6 were isolated for their ability to react with the peptide m6687-9 (WQEWERKVDFLEEQITALLEEAQ) to confirm reactivity against gp41, all antibodies were tested by ELISA at 1 g/ml against recombinant SIVmac239 protein gp120 (which does not have gp41) the longer peptide used for subsequent screening of antibodies is designated m6687-9. a rhesus monkey was experimentally infected with SIVmac239-gp41/g23. a peptide spanning the whole envelope sequence is designated m6687-9. ide sequences were identified by alignment with the human immunoglobulin germ line gene and allele sequences of the IMGT reference directory. two-dimensional graphical representations of the variable regions were created, also using IMGT/V-QUEST: the IMGT Collier de Perles; and three-dimensional structures of the variable domains were obtained. BS was added to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. wells were then washed five times with PBS 0.05%-Tween 20 (PBS-Tween) and 50 l of horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated goat anti-human antibody diluted 1:1,000 in 5% nonfat powdered milk in PBS was added to each well. the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk in PBS (blocking solution) for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with the indicated antibody (4G8, 6G8, or 7D6) at 1 g/ml in blocking solution overnight at 4\u00b0C. a rhesus monoclonal antibody that binds the highly immunogenic region of the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 was used at the same concentration as a positive control. 45 SIV-SEAP cells harbor a Tat-inducible, secreted engineered alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) reporter construct. p27 capsid protein for SIVmac239, SIVmac239-gp41/g23, and HIV-1 NL4-3 and 5 ng for SIV239-gp41/g123 and SIVmac316 were chosen as the lowest levels of viral input. hek293T, C8166-45 SIV-SEAP, and tCD40L cells were maintained as previously described. cells were seeded at 1.5 106 cells per flask the day before transfection. each flask was transfected with 3 g of DNA using calcium phosphate method. all three glycosylation sites of gp41 (SIVmac239-gp41/g123) were obtained from rhesus macaques housed at the new England primate research center in a biosafety level 3 animal containment facility. research was conducted according to the principles described in the guide for the care and use of laboratory animals. feeder cells were irradiated on 96-well plates in RPMI 1640 medium. they were supplemented with 10 to 15% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM l-glutamine, 25 mM HEPES, 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids, 1 mM sodium pyruvate and 10% hybridoma-enhancing supplement (Sigma-Aldrich) at 37\u00b0C in a humid atmosphere. three B-cell lines with positive ELISA readings were isolated by classical sequential-dilution cloning over fresh irradiated feeder cells. these monoclonal cell lines were expanded and transferred to serum-free medium (Invitrogen) the antibody-containing medium was harvested, precleared by centrifugation, and filtered through 0.22-m-pore-size membrane. the specificity of all three antibodies was confirmed after purification, and their characterization followed. three closely spaced N-linked-glycosylation consensus sites are found in rhesus macaque 323-92. the area surrounding glycosylation sites is shadowed in gray. overlapping peptides 6681 to 6690 match the sequence of the parental virus SIVmac239. gp41 are represented by an arrow and brackets; g123 indicates the location of the glycosylations; TM is the transmembrane domain of gp41; and HIR stands for highly immunogenic region (23). representative results of three independent experiments are shown. nal antibodies 4G8, 6G8, and 7D6 tested their reactivity by ELISA. peptides representing the entire SIVmac239 envelope (Env) were synthesized at the Massachusetts General Hospital peptide core facility (Charlestown, MA) single wells were coated with 50 l of each peptide at 40 g/ml in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) overnight at 4\u00b0C. samples were incubated for 10 min at 99\u00b0C before separation by SDS-PAGE. the membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat powdered milk in PBS. antibody 4B2 was used at the same concentration as a positive control. jugated secondary antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted 1:1,000 in blocking solution for 1 h at room temperature. specific signals were detected by enhanced-chemiluminescence system. similar conditions were used when analyzing recombinant proteins. us IgG was used as a negative control, and serum samples from animal 323-92 were used as a positive control. outer wells were filled with PBS to maintain hydration. each virus, in a total volume of 75 l at the indicated concentration, was then added to each well in columns 3 through 11. a rhesus monkey infected with glycan-deficient virus was infected with glycan-deficient SIVmac239 gp41/g23. a panel of 218 peptides overlapping the entire SIVmac239 Envelope protein was tested. p27 capsid in the supernatant was determined by an antigen capture assay. strong reactivity was shown to established immunodominant regions of Env, i.e., the variable loops V1-V2 and V3, the C terminus of gp120, and some peptides in the ectodomain of gp41. the same serum was tested against another set of overlapping peptides that had mutated glycosylation consensus sites. serum from 323-92 was used as a positive control. to fine map the epitopes of 4G8, 6G8, and 7D6, they were tested by ELISA against 15-aa overlapping peptides. reactivity of all three monoclonal antibodies to wild-type gp41 may seem surprising. rhesus macaque 323-92 infected with SIVmac239-gp41/g23. screening was based on ELISA reactivity to peptide m6687-9. all three antibodies were tested by ELISA for reactivity with peptide m6687-9. antibody 4B2, a monoclonal antibody that binds to the highly immunogenic region of the cytoplasmic domain of gp41 (23), was used as a positive control. a serum pool from rhesus macaques infected with wild-type SIV was also tested by Western blotting. all three antibodies efficiently bound the glycan-deficient version of gp41. reactivity against the wild-type version of the protein was undetectable. a pool of sera from SIV-infected animals was used as a positive control. we analyzed the variable-domain sequences of the heavy and light chains based on the human sequences and nomenclature (13), which are highly homologous to those of the rhesus macaque (9, 27, 30) the software was also used to identify the CDRs for heavy chain (CDR-H1, CDR-H2, and CDR-L3) together with the respective framework regions. the lengths (in amino acids) for the heavy chain CDRs (H1, H2, and H3) were very similar in all of them (4G8, 8, 8, and 14 aa; 6G8, 8, 7, and 14 aa; and 7D6, 8, 8, and 15 aa) and equal in the light chain CDRs (L1, L2, and L3 had common lengths of 6, 3, and 9 aa, respectively) the variable domains of all three MAbs were sequenced. identical residues are boxed in gray, and complementarity-determining regions are indicated with colored frames. 4G8 QGISNY 6 DAT 3 LQYNTYPFT 9 IGKV1-17*01 NAb IGKJ3*01 7D6 QGITNY 6 DAS 3 LQYNTYPFT 9 IGKV1-17*01 NAb IGKJ3*01 7D6 QGITNY 6 DAS 3 LQYNTYPFT 9 IGKV1-17*01 NAb IGKJ3*01 a Complementar the predicted structures were comparable for all three antibodies. a closer look at the CDR-H3s revealed three fairly different loop structures. CDR-H3 of 6G8 starts angled toward the light chain. 4G8, 6G8, and 7D6 were able to neutralize wild-type SIVmac239 gp41. mutants lack all three or the g2 and g3 N-linked glycosylation sites in gp41. antibodies 4G8, 6G8, and 7D6 neutralize glycan-deficient mutants of SIVmac239. aMonoclonal antibody b12 was used as a positive control for HIV-1 NL4-3 neutralization (IC50 = 3 g/ml) aMonoclonal antibody b12 was used as a positive control for HIV-1 NL4-3 neutralization. monoclonal antibodies against peptides underlying the carbohydrates of SIVmac239 gp41. rhesus monkey infected with glycan-deficient virus has three glycosylation attachment sites in gp41. for this purpose, we chose a rhesus macaque (animal 323-92) previously infected with glycan-deficient virus. overlapping peptides had mutated glycosylation consensus sites. strong reactivity to peptide m6687-9 was observed. the longer oligopeptide corresponds to a region of 23 aa to g2. antibody 4G8 showed strong binding to mutant peptides m6687 and m6688. antibody 7D6 bound poorly to m6687 and slightly over the background to m6688. but like 4G8 it did not detectably bind to wild-type peptides. m6687-9 corresponds to mutated glycan-deficient sequences underlying N-linked carbohydrate sites 2 and 3 of SIVmac239 gp41. all three antibodies were tested by ELISA for reactivity with peptide m6687-9 and gp120 and gp140 protein. Western blotting with 4G8, 6G8, and 7D6 showed effective binding of gp41 and inefficient binding of wild-type gp41 obtained from viral particles. reactivity against the wild-type version of the protein was undetectable. sus monoclonal antibody 4B2 was used as a positive control to demonstrate equivalent levels of gp41 protein per lane. image analysis demonstrated equivalent levels of wild-type and g23 mutant gp41 per ng virion p27. reactivity by Western blot was detected when larger amounts of recombinant, commercially-available, wild-type gp140 protein were used. all three were derived from productively rearranged sequences with no stop codons and proper in-frame junction. software was also used to identify the CDRs for heavy chain (CDR-H1, CDR-H2) and kappa light chain (CDR-L1, CDR-L2, and CDR-L3) together with respective framework regions. all three CDR-H2s had a three-nucleotide insertion (1 aa) corresponding to the first Gly in both 4G8 and 6G8 and to a Lys in 7D6. the closest germ line gene from which the antibodies likely originated corresponds to the same gene and allele in all three monoclonal antibodies. light chain (H1, H2, and L3) are colored as indicated on the left; hatched-circle positions indicate gaps according to the IMGT numbering. light blue indicates positions that are hydrophobic amino acids (hydropathy index with positive value) or a tryptophan (W) as in 50% or more of analyzed variable domains. IGKJ3*01 a Complementarity-determining regions (CDRs) were analyzed with IMGT/V-QUEST software for analysis of rearranged immunoglobulin nucleotide sequences. hyphens have been added to CDRs for proper alignment. high-resolution structure prediction model shows similar conformation of variable domains with variations in CDR-H3. the predicted model is shown for each antibody (top), as well as the top 10 most likely CDR conformations. the triple-glycan-deficient virus was the most sensitive to monoclonal antibody-mediated neutralization. no neutralization was detected with wild-type SIVmac239 or with the closely related but highly neutralization-sensitive strain SIVmac316. virions were obtained by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. hek293T cells were normalized for the amount of p27. SEAP activity was measured at 3 days after infection. rhesus macaque has three sites for N-linked glycosylation in the extracellular domain of its gp41. they all bind the amino acid sequence WQEWERKVDFLEEQITALLEEAQ. 4G8, 6G8, and 7D6 all effectively neutralize gp41 glycan-deficient mutants. monoclonal antibodies react significantly more strongly to mutant gp41 sequences than to wild-type gp41 sequences both by Western blotting and by peptide ELISA. the analyses were based on the human sequences and nomenclature (13), which are highly homologous to those of the rhesus macaques (9, 27, 30) all three antibodies share highly similar light chains, and their heavy-chain variable segment (V) appears to derive from the same germ line the same Gly found in the CDR-H3s of 4G8 and 6G8 could be responsible for the similar turn found in both CDR-H3s. the four Gly found in 7D6's CDR-H3 could account for the thin, inverted \u201cU\u201d shape (14) all three antibodies had glycine at position 2 of the CDR-H2."}
