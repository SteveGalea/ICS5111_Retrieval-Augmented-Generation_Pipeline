{"summary": "mNGS allows analysis of the virome, but has not yet been applied in COPD exacerbations. nasopharyngeal samples were analysed by mNGS and qPCR. chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is characterized by exacerbations with high morbidity and mortality. over 65 million patients suffer from this disease worldwide. a COPD exacerbation is an acute event leading to worsening of the respiratory symptoms. in this study, we analyse the composition of the virome in adult patients with exacerbations of COPD. aim of this study was to correlate the respiratory virome in COPD patients as found by mNGS. the viral respiratory panel covered by the multiplex real-time PCR (qPCR) developed in our laboratory consists of coronavirus 229E, coronavirus HKU1, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, influenza A, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1\u20134 (differentiation with probes), respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. qPCR isolation buffer was used as negative control (for extraction, library preparation, and sequencing) for library preparation, 7 l of nucleic acids were used, using the NEBNext\u00ae UltraTM Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina\u00ae. this resulted in a single tube per sample containing both DNA and RNA. a higher taxonomic level of a suspected viral target were extracted and de novo assembled with SPAdes version 3.11.1 [23] into longer stretches of contiguous sequences. the resulting contigs were then run against the blast NCBI nucleotide (nt) database using blastn 2.7.1 [24]. the performance of this study, including mNGS, was approved by the medical ethics review committee of the leiden University Medical Center. 154 patients had at least one exacerbation and in total 325 exacerbations were included in the Bergen COPD exacerbation study. coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus OC43, influenza A, influenza B, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza 1\u20134 (differentiation with probes), respiratory syncytial virus, and rhinovirus. nucleic acid amplification and detection by real-time PCR was performed on a BioRad CFX96 thermocycler. internal controls, Equine Arteritis virus (EAV the following steps were omitted: poly A mRNA capture isolation, rRNA depletion and DNase treatment step. approximately 10 million 150 bp paired-end reads per sample were obtained. reads with multiple best matches were uniquely assigned to the lowest common ancestor. qPCR Cq value and logarithm of normalized numbers of mNGS viral reads were tested with one-way ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis test when appropriate. diversity of the virome in different patient groups was characterized by Shannon Diversity Index (H) and tested with welch two sample t-test. patients (n = 63) Age median yrs (range) 63.5 (46.6\u201374.5) Male sex 40 (64%) BMI median, kg/m2 (range) 25 (15\u201339) Body composition Cachectic 7 (11%) Normal 24 (38%) Overweight 22 (35%) Obese 10 (16%) Smoking Never 0 (0%) Sometimes 37 (59%) Daily 26 (41%) GOLD stage II (FEV1 50\u201380%) 29 (46%) III (FEV exacerbation severity for entire exacerbation 0.75 Mild (not requiring AB or oral steroids or hospitalization) 14.3 85.7 Moderate (requiring AB or oral steroids or hospitalization) 28.6 71.4 Self-reported exacerbation severity at time of study sampling 0.64 Dyspnea unchanged or increased on errands outside home 36.4 63.6 Increased dyspnea at rest 28.6 71.4 Must sit up at night due to dysp cov OC43 1/23 (4) 27 2*/23 (4) 72,644\u20131,317,490 99\u201399 PIV3 2/23 (9) 26\u201336 2/23 (9) 59\u2013288,877 14\u201399 PIV4 1/23 (4) 24 1/23 (4) 185,235 100\u2013100 Rhinovirus 14/23 (61) 19\u201338 13**/23 (57)RV-A: 6/13RV-B: 2/13RV-C only one sample, that was rhinovirus positive by qPCR (Cq 38), could not be detected by mNGS. only one sample, that was rhinovirus positive by qPCR (Cq 38), could not be detected by mNGS. amplification appeared to have been inhibited, and repeated OC43 qPCR confirmed the positive mNGS result (Cq 25) sensitivity, specificity and predictive value were calculated based on 24 PCR positive and 1120 PCR negative target results of 88 samples. mNGS provides additional typing data, as compared to qPCR. of the 13 rhinoviruses detected with mNGS, 6 (46.2%) were rhinovirus A, 2 (15.4%) rhinovirus B and 5 (38.5%) rhinovirus C. the Shannon diversity scores were comparable for COPD exacerbations of viral aetiology in PCR positive versus negative patients. the respiratory virome: Proportion of normalized read counts of viral families per patient. pathogenic bacterial species detected with an abundance of >10% of the bacterial reads were: H. influenza (five samples); M. catarrhalis (20 samples); and S. pneumoniae (one sample); and S. aureus (one sample). no apparent association with bacteriophages was found, or was a high abundance of bacteriophages associated with COPD exacerbations. qPCR target virus detected not detected n = 23 n = 65 P* Patient characteristics Sex, % 0.21 Women 34.5 65.5 Men 22.0 78.0 smoking status, % 0.53 Ex-smoker 23.4 76.6 Current-smoker 29.3 70.7 GOLD stage (2007), % 0.35 II (FEV1 50\u201380%) 26.3 73.7 III (FEV1 30\u201350%) 30.8 69.2 IV (FEV1 30%) 9.1 9 exacerbations Lab developed real-time PCR Of the 88 samples, 23 (26%) tested positive with in-house PCR. 14 (61%) were rhinovirus positive, three influenza A, two coronavirus NL63, one coronavirus OC43, two parainfluenza 3 and one parainfluenza 4. of the 11 million reads, approximately 93% were Homo sapiens reads, 3% were bacterial and 0.1% viral. only one sample, that was rhinovirus positive by qPCR (Cq 38), could not be detected by mNGS. coronaviruses tested negative by means of qPCR, and the mNGS classification was inconclusive. de novo assembly resulted in 3 contigs (size 30743, 274 and 232 bp respectively) of these 83,252 betacoronavirus reads.

Shannon diversity (normalized reads, excluding internal controls) was significant lower for all viral reads(P0.001) and eukaryotic viruses (p = 0.028) in patients with viral pathogens. the respiratory bacteriome The most prevalent phyla were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes. no apparent association with bacteriophages was found, or was a high abundance of bacteriophages associated with COPD exacerbations of viral cause. the viral pathogen with the highest incidence was rhinovirus, followed by influenza, coronaviruses and para-influenza viruses. mNGS subtyping data was readily available by mNGS, accentuating the high resolution of mNGS. paediatric studies showed a correlation between virus load and severity in respiratory infections. a healthy virome size fits a certain size and diversity of bacteriophages, while during viral infection, pathogens predominate the virome. however, these studies don\u2019t compare between COPD exacerbation with and without viral infections. the percentage of proteobacteria was relatively high when compared to other studies of the nasopharyngeal microbiome. study of the lower airways by means of protected brushes during bronchoscopy is needed for further analysis of bacterial and viral (sub)populations. studies comparing the respiratory virome during stable state are needed to determine a potential correlation between the virome/bacteriome during stable state and disease progression or exacerbation frequency. mNGS protocol used was highly sensitive and specific for semi-quantitative detection of respiratory pathogenic viruses. excellent negative predictive value implicates the potential of mNGS to exclude a known viral infectious cause in one test."}
