{"summary": "we sampled small mammals at 5 sites in and around Portland, Oregon, USA. site 1, Forest Park (45.5916\u00b0N, 122.7983\u00b0W); site 2, Tryon Creek State Park (45.4337\u00b0N, 122.6690\u00b0W); site 3, Powell Butte Portland City Park (45.4837\u00b0N, 122.5059\u00b0W); and site 5, Tualatin River National Wildlife Refuge (45.3957\u00b0N, 122.8305\u00b0W). each park was trapped 19 times (4 nights each time) from October 2002 through September 2005. the total trap effort (traps nights) was 133,760 trap-nights. animals were treated as if they were infected with SNV. the differences between the number of captures on the first and last day of the trapping period were calculated and averaged, then compared with the welch 2-sample t\u2013test. a statistically conservative Bonferroni correction was made ( = 0.05/10 comparisons, or 0.005) (31). sites We sampled small mammals at 5 sites in and around Portland, Oregon, USA. we set up a trapping web 200 m in diameter (22) at each site. each station included an aluminum folding Sherman live trap and a custom-built mesh live trap. pitfall traps were made by using a 19-L bucket (30-cm diameter, 36-cm depth) pitfall traps were placed at each 20-, 50-, and 100-m trap station. each trapping web contained 2 Sherman and 2 mesh traps at 90\u00b0 angles to each other. deer mice were euthanized in a chloroform chamber (25) to obtain tissue samples for a companion study. the resulting specimens were tagged and stored at the museum of vertebrate biology at Portland State University. logistic regression with binomial errors was initially used to assess the association between infection prevalence and deer mouse density and species diversity. however, the resulting models showed such extensive overdispersion that we considered logistic regression to be an unsuitable statistical method. site 1 was the only site where infection prevalence significantly increased between years 1 and 2 (p = 0.005) infection prevalence was significantly higher at site 1 than at any other park during year 3 (p0.001) no regression model was able to account for association between infection prevalence and density of deer mice. the best fit model was of the form Y = x / (ax + b), R2 of 0.9994, p = 0.00001. Stepwise backward logistic regression with binomial errors found no association between infection prevalence and any vegetative factors alone. an increase in species diversity should also mean an increase in the number of predators of the rodent host species. predators control infection prevalence not by controlling the density of host species, but rather by an unrelated mechanism, possibly encounter reduction. a zoonotic release of predatory and competitive controls appears to have occurred. our system differs from the Lyme disease system, which depends on a vector that is not host specific (black-legged tick) to transmit the disease. increased diversity in both the Lyme disease and SNV systems appears to lead to decreased disease prevalence. density and frequency play a role in transmission of hantaviruses. the toll in illness and death from emerging zoonotic diseases is high. eradication usually is neither possible nor desirable. conservationists often are perceived as being overly biocentric and having little concern for human welfare. despite scientific research, unparalleled loss of species caused by anthropogenic factors continues at an unabated rate. conservation likely will not succeed without the support of the general public, who in turn influence the environmental policies our society embraces."}
