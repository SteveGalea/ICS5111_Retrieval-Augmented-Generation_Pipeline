{"summary": "large-scale infectious disease outbreaks appear to be increasing in frequency. this year alone, there have been outbreaks of cholera, Ebola, Lassa fever, Middle East respiratory syndrome, Nipah, Rift Valley fever, and yellow fever. at least 950 CHWs were involved in liberia's response to the Ebola outbreak (10) and over 1,500 were involved in C\u00f4te d'ivoire's precautionary response to the Ebola outbreak in neighboring Guinea and liberia (11). despite their establishment at the community level, CHWs are often under-utilized in the response to infectious disease outbreaks. inherent resilience could include adequate nutrition, access to clean water, effective sanitation systems, robust health systems. these efforts can reduce the risk of many morbidities and overall mortality (12) and improve the underlying population health. disproportionate effects of outbreaks on healthcare workers are likely to decimate the healthcare workforce resulting in a reluctance to work. disproportionate effects of outbreaks on healthcare workers are likely to rapidly decimate the healthcare workforce. the 2014 Ebola response, engaging CHWs in response procedures improved the efficacy of response activities (7). the role was validated in C\u00f4te d'ivoire (11) and Sierra Leone (7) during the 2014 Ebola epidemic where CHWs conducted community surveillance activities. a majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin (29), and acknowledging CHWs' competence in communicating important health concepts in a sensitive and culturally appropriate fashion. doing so could improve inherent resilience by leading to more successful behavioral change campaigns and increased awareness of the risks posed by environmental intrusion, bushmeat consumption. the guidance outlined in the IHR and JEE Tool provides a framework to promote global health security and pandemic preparedness. through their routine work, CHWs contribute to inherent resilience and pandemic preparedness by increasing access to health products and services, distributing health information, and reducing the burden felt by the formal healthcare system."}
