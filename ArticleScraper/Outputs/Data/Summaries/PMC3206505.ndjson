{"summary": "the simplest WHO definition of a pandemic at the time was \u201ca worldwide epidemic of a disease\u201d in 2003 accentuated this point, as did the Influenza Type A/H1N1 outbreaks of 2009. but before one jumps to the erroneous conclusion that globalization is the new demon, we need to remember that there have long been global movements of disease with devastating consequences. no single approach to managing health resources can adequately compensate for inequities. root problems may show themselves as poverty and hunger as a result of low incomes and lack of market access in remote villages in northern Bangladesh. root problems may show themselves as poverty and hunger as a result of low education or inappropriately distributed market power among stakeholders in livestock producing villages in Southeast Asia. the impact of these changes on the health of small-scale livestock producers can be severe, most particularly where zoonotic diseases are involved. all 93 human cases of highly pathogenic avian influenza in Vietnam, from 2003 to 2005, 42 of which were fatal, had a history of exposure to sick poultry. a high proportion of villagers are landless, live in extreme poverty, and face annual cycles of flooding resulting in annual hunger and malnutrition. the use of livestock and horticulture has been accepted as a suitable intervention by some villagers in the Chars area [11] with initial success. despite this step towards eradicating poverty in the Chars region of Bangladesh, major constraints remain. productivity of cattle is low due to poor genetics and weak knowledge of management skills, there is limited integration of environmental sustainability options, and coliform bacteria from livestock pose a health hazard to humans. this is an important step towards policy support for an integrated approach to health management in low income countries. the use of the grass roots level tactic is likely to remain dominant for many years to come. this does not speak well of mitigating the contributing factors and risks of inequities in human health; furthermore, it is a tactic without teeth for managing global health. government agencies have developed well-planned and- implemented programmes to respond to nEIDs such as HPAI. evidence from Vietnam and Thailand indicates that such programmes may reduce the risk of EIDs after farms have become infected, but they do not address pre-infection strategies. the government of Vietnam has made significant progress in this area. the government of Vietnam has developed a joint program to fight HPAI. the program aims at reduced risk of a global pandemic of HPAI emanating from Viet Nam. the concept of sustainable ecosystem health to prevent emerging infectious disease is present in bits and pieces of activities throughout the JP (e.g., surveillance, training of community animal and human health workers, communication, vaccination, and restructuring) but is not a major pillar of understanding behind many of the activities. the concept of sustainable ecosystem health to prevent emerging infectious disease is present in bits and pieces of activities throughout the JP. the project focuses on transfer of knowledge to high-level researchers working in lead research institutions in Southeast Asia. the project will explore the processes involved in building the capacity for research and application of ecosystem approaches to health management among researchers, development practitioners, and policy makers in Southeast Asia. the project is past the first six months of its activities and has engaged with more than fifty participants through focused discussions and exercises. it remains to be seen how well the principles and skills imparted in these training sessions will be incorporated into local and regional activities, programmes, and policies directed at reducing nEIDs. nedi is critical to exploring the causes of nEIDs and proposing recommendations for sustainable changes. the aim of improving livelihoods through increased food security will be achieved through healthier livestock and humans. this means less risk of health inequities in agricultural communities in poor countries and reduction in global poverty and hunger. the JP has been successful enough to warrant its use as a model for a broader One UN concept in which governments, international institutions, and development agencies bridge the sometimes enormous gaps between their institutions to share resources. we have also advocated for an ecosystem approach to health management, which is viewed as a holistic approach to problem solving in global health."}
