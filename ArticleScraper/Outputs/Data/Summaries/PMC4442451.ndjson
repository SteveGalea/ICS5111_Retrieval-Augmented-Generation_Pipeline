{"summary": "coronaviruses are sorted taxonomically into four genera: the alpha-, beta-, gamma-, and deltacoronaviruses. the resulting 3\u2032 nested set of subgenomic mRNAs are a defining characteristic of coronaviruses. in one of the earliest events of infection, the genome is translated into two overlapping polyproteins. polyproteins are processed into their constituent nonstructural protein (nsp) subunits by one or two papain-like proteases (PLPs) contained within nsp3 and by a main protease contained within nsp5. the replicase-transcriptase polyprotein gene represents the processed protein products nsp1 through nsp16. the expanded segment shows the domains of nsp3 as defined previously for MHV and the machinery of coronavirus RNA synthesis is built upon intracellular membranes. three of the replicase subunits\u2014nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6\u2014become cotranslationally anchored in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) most of the remaining subunits are presumed to associate with these three or with each other. nsp3 is a ubiquitin-like domain (Ubl1) (14) that is connected to a highly acidic (Ac) region of variable size (Fig. 1). MHV infection requires a critical interaction between Ubl1 and the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein (15). this interaction is very likely to be essential, since deletion of MHV Ubl1 is lethal to MHV (17). many, but not all, PLPs also possess a deubiquitinase activity, which acts to counter host innate immunity (20) there is a macrodomain with ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP) and poly(ADP-ribose)-binding activity. a role in viral RNA synthesis was proposed for the macrodomain. mutants of MHV and ADRP could be generated in which nsp1 and nsp2 were simultaneously eliminated. mutants were propagated in mouse 17 clone 1 (17Cl1) cells. monolayer cultures were maintained in Dulbecco's minimal essential medium. PCR amplification of cDNA was carried out with the Expand high-fidelity PCR system (Roche) Whole-genome sequences were generated from 18 partly overlapping RT-PCR products spanning the genome. tagged libraries of DNA fragments were prepared with a Nextera XT kit (Illumina) clone A of the N3S mutant was replaced with a synthetic fragment encoding residues 86 to 127 of nsp1, His7, and 58 residues of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) VP1-2A. the replacement fragment removed half of nsp1 and all of nsp2 and created 30 point mutations in 5\u2032 gRNA secondary structures. pA-SSN3HAmutP was generated by a two-step PCR that replaced the sacI-SpeI fragment to create the PLP1 catalytic mutation C289A. in a second deletion mutant, pA-SSN3HAP2, the SacI-Acc65I fragment of pA-SSN3HA was again removed, and this time it was replaced with a synthetic fragment that moved the deletion boundaries inward. RNA was extracted from infected cell monolayers with TRI-Reagent (Zymo) according to manufacturer's instructions. blots were visualized using an AlkPhos Direct kit. monolayers were washed twice with PBS and then lysed by the addition of 500 l of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.7 g/ml pepstatin, 1.0 g/ml leupeptin, 1.0 g/ml aprotinin, and 0.5 mg/ml Pefabloc SC (Roche) wild-type (WT), mutant, and revertant MHV strain A59 stocks were propagated in mouse 17 clone 1 (17Cl1) cells. plaque titrations and plaque purifications were carried out in mouse L2 cells. RT-PCR products were purified with QIAquick spin columns. whole-genome sequences were generated from 18 partly overlapping RT-PCR products spanning the genome. tagged libraries of DNA fragments were prepared with a Nextera XT kit (Illumina) for pA-N3S, clone A of the N3S mutant was replaced with a synthetic fragment encoding residues 86 to 127 of nsp1, His7, and 58 residues of foot-and-mouth disease virus. the replacement fragment removed half of nsp1 and all of nsp2 and created 30 point mutations in 5\u2032 gRNA secondary structures. pA-SSN3HAmutP was generated by a two-step PCR that replaced the sacI-SpeI fragment to create the PLP1 catalytic mutation C289A. in a second deletion mutant, pA-SSN3HAP2, the SacI-BstXI fragment of pA-SSN3HA was again removed, and this time it was replaced with a synthetic fragment that moved the deletion boundaries inward, as specified in Results. RNA was extracted from infected cell monolayers with TRI-Reagent (Zymo) the probe was labeled with an AlkPhos Direct kit. blots were visualized using CDP-Star detection reagent. sets of lysates were prepared from 75-cm2 confluent monolayers of L2 cells. monolayers were washed twice with PBS and then lysed by the addition of 500 l of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1.0% Nonidet P-40, 0.7 g/ml pepstatin, 1.0 g/ml leupeptin, 1.0 g/ml to-15% gradient polyacrylamide gels were probed with anti-HA monoclonal antibody (MAb 12CA5; Roche), anti-nsp1 antibody VU221 (32); the last two antibodies were also gifts from Mark Denison. nsp3 was first necessary to disentangle nsp3 from its obligation to process upstream nsp subunits. the genomic 5\u2032 end contains at least eight stem-loops (SL) (35\u201339), as well as a four-way junction formed by a long-range interaction between the regions upstream of SL5 and downstream of SL7 (40) LR indicates a long-range interaction between the regions upstream of SL5 and downstream of SL7 (40) frame start codons are boxed; nucleotides of out-of-frame start codons are circled. in SL4, the wild-type nsp1 start codon is labeled. the wild-type nsp1 start codon is labeled. structure (44) for wild-type MHV nucleotides 79 to 594 was verified to be identical to that of the wild type. the only upstream start codon that was not eliminated was that for the small upstream open reading frame (uORF) in SL4. a single isolate of the N3S mutant was obtained. translation of pA-N3S mRNA yielded a partial nsp3 fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa, somewhat larger than its calculated size of 35.9 kDa. however, since a product of identical mobility was obtained with pA-N3S1 and pA-N3S2 mRNAs, the first of which has a 5\u2032 UTR of only 25 nt, translation of pA-N pA-WT and pA-N3S were used to produce the 5\u2032-most fragment of the full-length genomic cDNA for wild-type virus and N3S mutant virus. Deleted derivatives reduced the size of the 5\u2032 UTR of the encoded mRNA from 591 nt to either 25 nt (pA-N3S1) or 249 nt (pA-N3S2) the complete elimination of nsp1 expression coupled with deletion of the entirety of nsp2 does not abolish the viability of MHV in tissue culture. this represents the largest truncation of the replicase-transcriptase that has yet been made. however, this raised the possibility that it needed to acquire one or more adaptive mutations in order to be fully viable. 12 cultures began from individual plaques of N3S were passaged serially 10 to 13 times at 39\u00b0C in L2 cells. one revertant plaque originating from each culture was purified for analysis. each chosen revertant formed plaques that were substantially larger than those of the wild-type mutant. nsp3 mutations in 12 independent revertants of the original N3S mutant. revertants exhibited from one to three mutations in the nsp3 coding region. revertants were clustered in the carboxy-terminal Y domain or in the region adjacent to the first transmembrane domain. nsp3 mutations appear to demarcate the most critical domains of nsp3. this mutant did not provide an optimal starting point for further dissection of nsp3. we used the 2A peptide autoprocessing element from the picornavirus foot-and-mouth disease virus. nsp1 was separated from nsp3 by a 2A element. stop-start-nsp3 mutant would generate a single extra residue, proline, at the amino terminus of nsp3. this was expected to be tolerated, because the first 18 residues of MHV Ubl1 are unstructured and do not contribute to the interaction with N protein (16). mRNAs were translated in a reticulocyte lysate system, followed by fluorography. mock, control without added mRNA; [nsp1]-2A and [nsp3] autoprocessed products from pA-SSN3x runoff mRNA; nsp1-[nsp2], unprocessed product from pA-SSN3x runoff mRNA; nsp1-[ns the final version of the SSN3 construct incorporated a 20-amino-acid FMDV 2A peptide plus 38 upstream residues from its native polyprotein sequence. three independent isolates of the SSN3 mutant were obtained, all having the same phenotype, and one was chosen for further analysis. the sequence of this virus was determined from the 5\u2032 end of the genome through the PLP1 domain. translation of pA-SSN3 mRNA gave rise to two discrete products. the smaller of which was exactly the size expected (21.5 kDa) for the nsp1 fragment. the larger pA-SSN3 product migrated more slowly than expected for a 39.5-kDa protein. mRNA demonstrated that the mutations in the SSN3x construct effectively eliminated autoprocessing by its 2A element. this enabled normal initiation of nsp1 with equimolar production of mature nsp3. the mutant was rebuilt with FLAG and HA epitopes inserted in tandem immediately downstream of the Ac region. the knockout of PLP1 catalytic activity was expected to have little or no effect in the SSN3 background. we had expected the knockout of PLP1 catalytic activity to have little or no effect in the SSN3 background. we had expected the knockout of PLP1 catalytic activity to have little or no effect in the SSN3 background. s were stained with neutral red at 72 h postinfection and photographed 18 h later. the extent of the deletion was based on the smallest expressed segments of MHV nsp3 that exhibited protease activity in vitro. in the second mutant, SSN3HAP2 (deletion of amino acids 274 to 460), the boundaries of the first deletion were moved inward, to the edges of the region of PLP1 that is most conserved among the lineage A MHV can retain a surprising degree of hardiness despite the loss of half of nsp1, all of nsp2, and one-fifth of nsp3. the sum of the deletions in the SSN3HAP3 mutant totals 3,120 nucleotides, nearly one-tenth of the viral genome. a single band of 235 kDa was observed for the SSN3HAP3 mutant. this finding confirms that mature nsp3 of SSN3HAP3 was stably produced. this finding confirms that mature nsp3 of SSN3HAP3 harbored a large deletion. anti-nsp1 antibody revealed a 26-kDa protein for wild-type-infected cell lysates. the same antiserum also detected the 21.5-kDa nsp1-2A fragment of the SSN3 mutant. this showed that there was efficient in vivo termination by the 2A element. data from a second, independent growth experiment were nearly identical to those shown in Fig. 8A. however, 17Cl1 monolayers infected with either of the two mutants underwent a period of partial detachment from 16 to 24 h postinfection but had recovered to roughly 80% confluence by 48 h postinfection. the major detriment caused by the engineering of the SSN3-derived mutants was due to the loss of nsp1 and n nsp3-start (N3S) cleavage events of replicase-transcriptase polyprotein maturation. nsp3-start (N3S) is the first mutant to disentangle nsp3 from its obligation to process upstream nsp subunits. nsp3-start (N3S) cleavage events of replicase-transcriptase polyprotein maturation. the 5\u2032 ends of coronavirus genomes, including the 5\u2032 UTR and part of the nsp1 coding region, contain multiple cis-acting RNA structures that are critical for replication and transcription. the genomic 5\u2032 end contains at least eight stem-loops (SL) (35\u201339), as well as a four-way junction formed by a long-range interaction between the regions upstream of SL5 and downstream of SL7 (40). changes engineered in the N3S mutant to disrupt 5 in-frame start codons and 6 out-of-frame start codons upstream of the nsp3 ORF. nucleotides of in-frame start codons are boxed; nucleotides of out-of-frame start codons are circled. start codon, the original start codon for nsp1 and the other four in-frame upstream AUG codons were each knocked out by mutations at 2 or 3 positions. additional point mutations were made to restore any base pairs in RNA secondary structures that would be disrupted by the start codon knockouts. mfold-predicted structure for the N3S mutant was verified to be identical to that of the wild type. pA-N3S1 and pA-N3S2 mRNAs contained deletions in the 5\u2032 UTR of pA-N3S. translation of pA-N3S mRNA yielded a partial nsp3 fragment with an apparent molecular mass of 46 kDa. this showed that translation of pA-N3S mRNA had started at the expected location. pA-WT and pA-N3S were used to produce the 5\u2032-most fragment of the full-length genomic cDNA for wild-type virus and N3S mutant virus. pA-N3S reduced the size of the 5\u2032 UTR of the encoded mRNA from 591 nt to either 25 nt or 249 nt (pA-N3S2). nsp3 and nsp1-[nsp2] proteins contain 4 and 10 methionine residues. this represents the largest truncation of the replicase-transcriptase that has yet been made. this represents the largest truncation of the replicase-transcriptase that has been made. two mutations in the spike (S) protein, Q99H in the ectodomain and C1280S in the transmembrane domain, could conceivably affect growth but are highly unlikely to signify an interaction between S and nsp3. the mutant formed plaques that were tiny compared to those of the wild type. plaques of two representative revertants of the N3S mutant were titrated on L2 cells. monolayers were stained with neutral red at 72 h postinfection. all revertants exhibited from one to three mutations in the nsp3 coding region. nsp3 mutations appear to demarcate most critical domains of nsp3. this mutant did not provide an optimal starting point for further dissection of nsp3. nsp1-nsp2 and nsp2-nsp3 cleavage events. stop-start-NSP3 mutant is designated stop-start-NSP3 (SSN3). the fragment of nsp1 (amino acids 1 to 127) was chosen to preserve the same cis-acting genomic RNA structures as had been retained in the N3S mutant. autoprocessing of the 2A element would generate a single extra residue, proline, at the amino terminus of nsp3. pA-WT, pA-SSN3, and pASSN3x were used for the 5\u2032-most fragments of the corresponding full-length genomic cDNAs. they were truncated with BstZ17I or SpeI for runoff in vitro transcription. the mRNAs were translated in a reticulocyte lysate system. the final version of the SSN3 construct incorporated a 20-amino-acid FMDV 2A peptide plus 38 upstream residues from its native polyprotein sequence, preceded by a His7 epitope tag. the sequence of this virus was determined from the 5\u2032 end of the genome through the PLP1 domain and was confirmed to be exactly as expected, with no additional mutations. transfected pA-SSN3x full-length RNA produced no signs of infection, indicating that the mutated 2A sequence was lethal. this strongly suggests that a permanent blockage of the amino terminus of nsp3 results in a nonfunctional replicase-transcriptase. we in vitro-translated synthetic mRNAs identical to the 5\u2032 ends of these mutant genomes. absence of this unprocessed product upon translation of pA-SSN3x mRNA showed that there was complete efficiency of termination by the incorporated 2A element. however, the lack of production of either the nsp3 or nsp1-2A fragments demonstrated that the mutations in the SSN3x construct effectively eliminated autoprocessing by its 2A element. sequence determination from the 5\u2032 end of the genome through most of nsp3 confirmed the presence in each of exactly the engineered composition with no extraneous mutations. the epitope tags were fully tolerated in what is thought to be an unstructured linker between the Ac region and PLP1 (12). due numbers given are those of mature wild-type nsp3. they do not include the extra amino-terminal proline or the 17-amino-acid epitope tag insertion following Ac in SSN3HA and related constructs. two independent isolates of the SSN3HAP3 virus were recovered. the mutant formed plaques only slightly smaller than those of the corresponding SSN3HA parent at 33\u00b0C, 37\u00b0C, and 39\u00b0C. the sum of the deletions totals 3,120 nucleotides, nearly one-tenth of the viral genome. we observed the same band for wild-type, SSN3, SSN3HA, and SSN3HAmutP viruses in direct Western blots with VU164 antiserum. this finding confirms that mature nsp3 of SSN3HAP3 was stably produced and that it harbored a large deletion. this finding confirms that mature nsp3 of the SSN3HAP3 virus was stably produced. Western blots probed with anti-nsp1 antibody revealed 26-kDa protein for wild-type-infected cell lysates. the same antiserum also detected the 21.5-kDa nsp1-2A fragment of the SSN3 mutant. this showed that there was efficient in vivo termination by the 2A element. wild-type virus reached peak titers of 7.8 107 PFU/ml between 8 and 12 h postinfection. the titers were 1.6 and 2.0 log10 lower than those of the wild type with somewhat delayed kinetics, peaking between 12 and 16 h postinfection. mutants produced the same subgenomic RNA species in the same relative proportions as wild-type MHV. deletion of the PLP1 and ADRP domains of nsp3 did not qualitatively alter the ability of MHV to execute the characteristic pattern of coronavirus RNA replication and transcription. nsp3 is a huge multidomain protein (222 kDa in MHV) constituting more than a quarter of the mass of the replicase-transcriptase complex. but it is less clear what roles are played by most of these domains, except for the well-characterized processing and deubiquitinating activities. nsp3 deletion and knockout of all remaining start codons was necessary. nsp3 deletion and knockout of all remaining start codons was required. nsp1 and nsp2 were previously eliminated from MHV nsp1. nsp1 is a suppressor of host protein synthesis, both by stimulation of a ribosome-associated endonuclease and by direct inhibition of translation initiation. viability of the N3S mutant rules out any obligatory role for nsp1 in coronavirus RNA synthesis. nsp2 deletion viruses showed a quantitative (2-fold) drop in RNA synthesis relative to wild-type levels. nsp2 is very poorly conserved, even among coronaviruses in the same genus. indirect evidence suggests a role for SARS-CoV nsp2 in the alteration of intracellular signaling. the lethality of the nonfunctional 2A element in the SSN3x mutant is a strong indication that under some circumstances, uncleaved polypeptide upstream of nsp3 can obstruct access to the Ubl1 domain. we were then able to address the requirements for the PLP1 and ADRP domains of nsp3. the multiplicity and specificity of nsp3 PLPs vary. MHV PLP1 may be considered a feature particular to the lineage A betacoronaviruses. a constructed PLP1 catalytic mutant, SSN3HAmutP, had a phenotype identical to that of its parent viruses, SSN3 and SSN3HAmutP. this result was anticipated, because Graham and Denison had previously demonstrated the viability of a similar MHV PLP1 catalytic mutant. the PLP1 of HCoV-229E proposed that an as-yet undefined nonproteolytic role of PLP1 might be mediated by interactions between its universally conserved zinc finger and other nsp's or RNA (21) the mutant removed 418 amino acids, more than one-fifth of the nsp3 molecule, ruling out any critical secondary role for the PLP1 domain in MHV RNA synthesis. the ADRP activity of coronavirus macrodomains has a very low turnover (22, 51, 67) however, it is not clear why host cytoplasmic macrodomain proteins are inadequate for this task. if hydrolysis of ADP-ribose-1\u2032\u2032-monophosphate is critical for the virus, it is not clear why host cytoplasmic macrodomain proteins are inadequate. the carboxy-terminal Y domain (22) presents an intriguing target for intermolecular interactions. it would be of great interest to determine whether infections by SSN3, SSN3HAP3 or other mutants created here lead to the formation of the full spectrum of DMVs and other membrane alterations observed during wild-type infection."}
