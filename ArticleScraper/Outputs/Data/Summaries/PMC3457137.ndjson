{"summary": "type I and type III IFNs are cytokines that use distinct receptor complexes for signaling and which induce an antiviral state in uninfected cells. the family includes more than 10 different IFN- subtypes, IFN-, and minor subtypes such as IFN-1, -2, and -3 (8, 19) classical immune cells including pDC are not present in healthy brains (10, 13), suggesting that other cell types are mainly responsible for IFN synthesis in this organ. previous attempts to unambiguously identify these alternative IFN-producing cells did not yield a clear picture. mutant was less virulent in mice than wild-type LACV. both viruses caused encephalitis and death after 5 to 10 days. transgenic mice in which reporter genes are inserted into the coding regions of the IFN- or - genes are promising new tools for studying virus-induced expression of IFN genes in vivo. gene in this reporter mouse can be rearranged in defined cell types by crossing these animals with mice that express Cre recombinase in a cell-type-specific manner. we identified astrocytes and microglia as the main IFN- producers in LACV-infected brains. mice were bred in the animal facility of the department of Virology at the University of Freiburg. Plaque assays were performed in Vero cells using six-well plates. supernatants were incubated for 72 h at 37\u00b0C in 5% CO2. cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. mice were incubated with rabbit anti-luciferase antibody (70C-CR2020RAP; Fitzgerald), mouse anti-NeuN (MAB377; Millipore), rat anti-F4/80 (MCA497R; AbD Serotec), mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein ([GFAP] G3893; Sigma-Aldrich) for detection of luciferase, signal amplification with a TSA (tyramide mice were infected intraperitoneally with 104 PFU of wild-type or mutant LACV diluted in 100 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) mice were infected intraperitoneally with 104 PFU of wild-type or mutant LACV diluted in 100 l of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) luciferase activity measured in a single luciferase assay system. animals were sacrificed with ketamine (3.7%), xylazine (0.2%), and acepromazine (0.02%) and transcardially perfused with 0.9% NaCl. brains were postfixed in the same solution for 6 more hours. luciferase-positive cells were typically observed in distinct clusters which were present in all parts of virus-infected brains. the number of luciferase-positive cells was at least 10-fold higher in brains of diseased mice infected with the LACV-NSs mutant than in brains infected with LACV-wt. shape and distribution of luciferase-positive cells indicated that they might be mostly astrocytes. this was particularly obvious in the cerebellum, where luciferase-positive cells were typically observed in immediate vicinity of virus-infected Purkinje cell somata. mutant virus replicated substantially less well than wild-type virus. luciferase-positive cells expressed macrophage/microglia marker protein F4/80. luciferase-positive cells stained positive for neuron marker NeuN. at least 300 luciferase-positive cells were evaluated individually for each double-staining experiment listed in Table 1. luciferase-positive cells expressed GFAP, suggesting they represent astrocytes. the number of luciferase-positive cells expressing NeuN was approximately 1%. a Data in parentheses represent the number of cells positive for the corresponding marker/number of luciferase-positive cells analyzed. a microglia/macrophage population is defined here as F4/80-positive cells. we carefully analyzed if LACV can establish productive infections in these cell types. luciferase-positive cells expressed in brains of infected LysM-Cre mice expressed GFAP. luciferase-positive cells expressed in brains of infected LysM-Cre mice expressed GFAP. luciferase-positive cells expressed in brains of infected LysM-Cre mice expressed GFAP. conditional reporter mice express the luciferase reporter gene in the predicted cell types. luciferase expression is driven by the virus-inducible IFN- promoter. a direct comparison of reporter gene activity in individual animals will yield meaningful quantitative data only if virus replication rates in brains are similar. luciferase activity in brain extracts from mice infected with LACV-NSs was only slightly reduced. at least 71.4% of the luciferase signal originates from virus-mediated stimulation of astrocytes and neurons. conditional reporter mice show no significant differences in susceptibility to LACV. reporter mice in which the luciferase gene is expressed exclusively in astrocytes and neurons (thy), neurons only (syn) or microglia/macrophages (lysM) were infected with LACV-NSs (A and B) or LACV-wt (C and D) the contribution of neurons to overall luciferase activity did not differ substantially in mice infected with either wild-type or mutant LACV. the contribution of astrocytes was clearly less prominent in wild-type mice than in mice infected with the NSs mutant virus. luciferase-positive cells were found in close proximity to virus-infected cells. luciferase-positive cells were usually not positive for viral antigen. luciferase-positive cells are found near LACV-infected cells in various brain regions. luciferase levels in brains of mice infected with wild-type or NSs-deficient LACV were about 6-fold enhanced. mutant virus replicated substantially less well than wild-type virus. luciferase-positive cells expressed macrophage/microglia marker protein F4/80. luciferase-positive neurons were detected only in LACV-NSs-infected brains. cells were counterstained with DAPI. single-channel and merged pictures of the same frames are shown. mouse brains infected with wild-type or mutant LACV Virus Frequency of luciferase-positive cells by type (%)a Astrocytesb Microglia/macrophagesc Neuronsd LACV-NSs 89 (536/603) 5 (29/561) 1 (4/424) LACV-wt 35 (134/379) 62 (189/306) 0 (0/337) luciferase-positive cells expressed in brains of infected LysM-Cre mice expressed F4/80, an antigen of microglia and macrophages, but not the astrocyte marker GFAP. luciferase-positive cells expressed in brains of infected LysM-Cre mice expressed GFAP, but not the astrocyte marker GFAP. conditional reporter mice express the luciferase reporter gene in the predicted cells. LysM-Cre+/ IFN-+/flox-luc mice were infected with LACV-NSs. brain sections of diseased mice were simultaneously stained for luciferase (green) and the neuron marker NeuN (red) luciferase activity in brain extracts from mice infected with LACV-NSs was only slightly reduced. at least 71.4% of luciferase signal originates from virus-mediated stimulation of astrocytes and neurons. conditional reporter mice show no significant differences in susceptibility to LACV. reporter mice infected with LACV-NSs or LACV-wt were monitored for neurological symptoms. diseased animals were killed, and brain titers were determined. no significant differences were observed between the different mouse strains. luciferase activity in brains of wild-type LACV-infected mice was significantly increased. on average, it accounted for 41.4% of the signal observed in global mice infected with wild-type or mutant LACV. the contribution of astrocytes was clearly less prominent in wild-type mice than in mice infected with the NSs mutant virus. our work demonstrates that virus-encoded antagonistic factors can affect IFN production by acting selectively on distinct cell types. previous attempts to characterize the production of IFN during viral encephalitis had already indicated that various cell types contain detectable levels of type I IFN (10) Synapsin1 promoter-driven expression of Cre recombinase resulted in selective rearrangement of the loxP-tagged IFN- locus in neurons. the results of our immunostaining experiments and those of our Cre-LoxP approach showed a very good correlation in the case of astrocytes and microglia. luciferase signal in microglia was not negatively regulated by NSs. if wild-type virus was administered instead of LACV-NSs, IFN production by microglia correlated directly with the virus load in the brain. neurons exceed the quantity of IFN- produced by microglia and macrophages. microglia proved to be a more robust source of IFN synthesis."}
