{"summary": "the ubiquitin-like protein (Ubl) ISG15 (interferon-stimulated gene 15) was first cloned from mice [1] and later also from human cells [2] on the basis of its sequence, the protein was assigned to the family of USPs. the trimeric complex binds to the ISRE element in promoters of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) and induces the expression of ISGs including USP18, ISG15 and the E1, E2 and E3 enzymes. USP18 interacts with IFNAR2 and STAT2 to block type I interferon signalling in a protease-independent manner. USP18 is highly specific for ISG15 and does not show cross-reactivity towards ubiquitin [13\u201315]. Moreover, USP18 represents the major ISG15 deconjugating enzyme in vivo. despite enhanced ISGylation, mice homozygous for USP18-C61A are healthy and display a normal lifespan. the importance of ISG15 in defeating viral infections is underlined by the fact that several viruses counteract ISGylation and express proteins that either bind ISG15 (Influenza B) [29,30] or proteases that deconjugate ISG15 from proteins (foot-and-mouth disease virus [31,33], SARS-corona virus [34], MERS-corona virus [34]). the enzyme crystallised in two conformations that mainly differ in the orientation of the finger domain. only the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 makes extensive contacts with all three domains of USP18 (blue) and the C-terminal tail of ISG15 lies in the cleft between the palm and the thumb domains where it reaches the catalytic triad. SG15 complex revealed the catalytically active conformation of USP18. all three domains of USP18 contribute to binding of ISG15. only the C-terminal Ubl domain of ISG15 interacts with USP18. the observed phenotype persists in USP18/ISG15 double knockout mice (USP18//ISG15/) and hence develops independent of ISG15 [38] the genetic background of the transgenic animal has a major impact on the survival. the genetic background of the transgenic animal has a major impact on the survival. mice that specifically lack USP18 in microglia develop inflammation in the white matter of the brain with hyperactivated microglia that show prolonged phosphorylation of STAT. this phenotype can be rescued in mice that additionally lack IFNAR1 showing that the observed phenotype is strictly dependent on the type I interferon signalling pathway [41] USP18Ity9/Ity9-derived cells exhibit enhanced phosphorylation of STAT1 and increased expression of interferon-target genes after stimulation with IFN. blocking the type I interferon receptor prior to infection with Salmonella improved survival of USP18Ity9/Ity9 mice. silencing of USP18 in hepatoma cell lines potentiates antiviral activity of type I interferons against HBV and HCV. high levels of USP18 in these cells promote resistance to TRAIL-induced apoptosis. five patients from two families with autosomal recessive loss-of-function mutations in USP18. the patients developed Pseudo-TORCH syndrome that resembles a congenital infection in the absence of an infectious agent. all patients died within a few days after birth. p-STAT1 and 2 form a heterodimer that translocates into the nucleus and binds the transcription factor IRF9 (IFN-regulatory factor 9) to form the trimeric complex ISGF3 (IFN-stimulated gene factor 3) this complex binds to promoters of genes that contain an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and stimulates transcription of interferon target genes (ISGs) a coiled-coil region in the central part of STAT2 is required for binding to USP18. both N- and C-terminal regions in USP18 were described to bind to STAT2. in STAT2-deficient cells, the inhibition of type I interferon signalling was reduced and the interaction between IFNAR2 and USP18 was weakened. in 2013, Liu et al. [59] reported that USP18 regulates the activation of T cells. USP18 was reported to negatively regulate NF-B signalling in TH17 cells. the reported interactions between USP18 and IFNAR2 as well as STAT2 remain to be characterised biochemically and structurally. if USP18, once bound to IFNAR2 and STAT2, is still able to deISGylate target proteins."}
