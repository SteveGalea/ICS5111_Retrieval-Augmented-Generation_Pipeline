{"summary": "clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) is the major pathway for receptor-dependent endocytosis in many cell types. it is dependent on adaptor proteins, such as the AP-2 complex, the GTPase dynamin [2], [3], and several other important accessory molecules. a number of viruses use caveolae for infection. caveolin-independent pathways also originate from lipid-rafts. these pathways have different requirements for cellular proteins such as dynamin, flotillin, small GTPases, and cholesterol and other specific lipids. macropinocytosis is the major form of endocytosis responsible for the majority of fluid-phase uptake for a number of cell types. the outer capsid is formed from two viral proteins, VP2 and VP5. the inner core-particle consists of a \u2018core-surface\u2019 layer composed of VP7. the core-particle is also infectious in its own right. DN inhibitors of endocytosis to investigate entry and infection of BHK cells. clathrin pathway is not the major entry route used by BTV-1 to infect BHK cells. but the entry mechanism shares certain characteristics in common with macropinocytosis and appears to deliver virus directly to late endosomal compartments. mouse monoclonal antibody (Mab 4A1) to Lysosomal Antigen -1 (LAMP-1) was from the developmental studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa) the mouse monoclonal antibody (Mab 4A1) to Lysosomal Antigen -1 was from Jean Gruenberg (University of Geneva) wt and dominant-negative (DN)-dynamin-2 (K44A) were from Mark McNiven (Mayo Clinic. Rochester. USA). wt and dominant-negative (DN)-dynamin-2 (K44A) were from Alexandre Benmerah (Universit\u00e9 Paris Descartes. France). cells were seeded on glass coverslips (BDH) in antibiotic-free cell-culture medium. cells were inoculated with BTV-1 at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 infectious virus particle per cell, in serum-free medium for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. unbound virus was removed by washing with GMEM and cells returned to 37\u00b0C in cell culture medium with reduced (2%) FBS. active endosomal acidification is required for BTV infection. cells were mock-treated or pre-treated (PT) with 12 nM concanamycin-A. then infected with BTV-1 (m.o.i. = 1). At the end of the infection the cells were processed for confocal microscopy counting at least 700 cells per time point. the cells were washed with PBS pH 7.5 (Sigma) and permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 15 minutes. the cells were washed with PBS and incubated with primary antibodies in block buffer for 1 h, washed again with PBS. transfected cells expressing AP180C were identified using the anti-c-myc antibody (9E10) and a goat, anti-mouse Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody. all data were collected sequentially to eliminate cross talk between fluorescent dyes on a Leica SP2 Confocal Scanning Laser Microscope. the specificity of secondary antibodies for the target primary antibody was confirmed by showing a lack of cross-reactivity with non-target primary antibodies. the level of infection of inhibitor-treated cells was normalised to the levels of infection of the mock-treated controls. cells and viruses Baby Hamster Kidney (BHK)-21 cells were obtained from the European Cell Culture Collection and maintained at 37\u00b0C, 5% CO2. mab 9E10 (anti-c-myc) was from the Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank (University of Iowa) the mouse monoclonal antibody (Mab 4A1) to Lysosomal Antigen -1 (LAMP-1) was from Jean Gruenberg. Species specific, Alexa-Fluor conjugated secondary antibodies were from Invitrogen. cells were seeded on glass coverslips (BDH) in antibiotic-free cell-culture medium. they were transfected when 60% confluent. cells were inoculated with BTV-1 at a multiplicity of infection. unbound virus was removed by washing with GMEM. cells returned to 37\u00b0C in serum-free medium with reduced (2%) FBS. GMEM added inhibitors (Methyl-cyclodextrin, cytochalasin-D or latrunculin-A) PT treated with 12 nM concanamycin-A, then infected with BTV-1 (m.o.i. = 1). Alternatively, concanamycin-A was added to the cells coincident with the start of infection. cells were processed for confocal microscopy counting at least 700 cells per time point. the cells were washed with PBS pH 7.5 (Sigma) and permeablized with 0.1% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 15 minutes. the cells were permeablized with 0.1% Saponin (in place of Triton X-100) for 20 minutes. non-specific binding sites were blocked with block buffer. anti-mouse Alexa-488 conjugated secondary antibody. all data were collected sequentially to eliminate cross talk. the specificity of the secondary antibodies for the target primary antibody was confirmed by showing a lack of cross-reactivity with non-target primary antibodies. BTV-10 infects Hela and Vero cells using CME for entry. cells were transiently transfected to express AP180C-c-myc, GFP-DN-Eps15 or a control GFP-Eps15. at 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with transferrin for 15 minutes or with BTV-1 for 0.5 h. thrin-mediated endocytosis was reduced by 82% in cells expressing AP180C. expression of DN-Eps15 or AP180C did not significantly inhibit virus uptake. in virtually all cells expressing the DN proteins the pattern of virus labelling was indistinguishable from cells expressing the Esp15 control or cells that were not expressing a transgene. cells were processed for confocal microscopy using Orab1 (anti-NS2) to identify infected cells. panel (M) shows infected cells whereas panel (N) show a merged image for infection and AP180C expression for the same cells as in panel M. cells were scored positive for transferrin or BTV-1 uptake, or for infection. cells were incubated with BTV-1 (m.o.i. = 1) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were then washed to remove excess virus. infection continued for a further 11 h when the cells were fixed. concanamycin-A was added 2 h after infection was initiated. the frequency of infection was reduced by 50% compared to mock treated cells. similar results were obtained using ammonium chloride in place of concanamycin-A. this suggests that BTV-1 is delivered to acidic endosomes much slower than expected. selective cholesterol depletion from the plasma membrane does not inhibit BTV-1 infection. cells were mock-treated (A) or pre-treated with 7.5 mM MCD (B) and then incubated with filipin and viewed by confocal microscopy. BHK cells were transfected to express wt dynamin-2 or DN-dynamin-2. at 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with transferrin. at 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with a DN mutant. the cells were then fixed and processed for confocal microscopy. DN-dynamin-2 does not inhibit BTV-1 infection. panels (E) and (H) show uptake of BTV-1, whereas panels (F) and (H) show merged images for virus and transgene expression for the same cells as in panels A and C. at the end of the infection the cells were labelled using Orab1 (anti-NS2) and scored for infection by confocal microscopy. BHK cells were treated with the general dynamin inhibitor, dynasore [56] to further investigate the role of dynamin in BTV-1 infection. Mock-treated and dynasore-treated cells were incubated with BTV-1, Alexa-568 labelled transferrin or Alexa-568 labelled dextran. dynasore effectively inhibited uptake of all three ligands. BTV-1 entry into BHK cells shares characteristics with macropinocytosis. cells were mock-treated, or treated with the drug and successful disruption of actin filaments confirmed by confocal microscopy. cells were then fixed and processed for confocal microscopy using PM10 to detect input virus as described above. panel A show virus uptake by mock-treated cells. cells were pre-treated with 2 M cytochalasin-D or 1.5 M latrunculin-A. the drugs were also added to other cells after the start of infection. at the end of the infection the cells were labelled using Orab1 (anti-NS2) and scored for infection by confocal microscopy counting at least 300 cells per condition. ide is a membrane permeable weak base that rapidly raises endosomal pH. infection can only occur during the period when cytochalasin-D was present. cytochalasin-D was added to other cells immediately after the virus inoculums were removed and co-incident with the addition of ammonium chloride. almost all cells showed transferrin uptake; (n>300 cells counted) results also suggest that BTV-1 entry may be mediated by macropinocytosis or a macropinocytosis-like mechanism. dextran is likely to enter BHK cells using an actin-independent pathway. BTV-1 was internalised for 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 minutes before cells were fixed and processed for confocal microscopy. early- and recycling-endosomes were labelled by incubating the cells with transferrin during the final 15 minutes of virus uptake. at 0.5 h and 2 h post-entry, virus was not co-localised with LAMP-1. at 0.5 and 2 h post uptake, 34% and 54% of the virus was judged to be co-localised with LAMP-1. results consistent with an uptake mechanism that delivers BTV-1 to LAMP-1 positive compartments without the need to first pass through early-endosomes. cells were transfected to express AP180C-c-myc, GFP-DN-Eps15, or a control GFP-Eps15. at 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with transferrin for 15 minutes. at 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with Alexa-568 labelled transferrin for 15 minutes or with BTV-1 for 0.5 h. in virtually all cells expressing the DN proteins the pattern of virus labelling was indistinguishable from cells expressing the Esp15 control. clathrin-mediated endocytosis does not block BTV-1 uptake or infection. cells were transfected to express GFP-Eps15 control (A\u2013D), GFP-DN-Eps15 (E\u2013H) or AP180C-c-myc (I\u2013N) cells were scored positive for transferrin or BTV-1 uptake. level of uptake by cells expressing AP180C (EC) was normalised to the level of uptake or infection by the cells of the non-expressing population. infected cells were identified using a rabbit antibody (Orab1) that binds the viral NS2 protein (a marker of virus replication) and an Alexa-568 conjugated secondary antibody. intense areas of NS2 labelling were detected within infected cells. the results normalised to the results obtained for the non-expressing cell population. canamycin-A is delivered to acidic endosomes much slower than expected. the pattern of virus uptake by concanamycin-A treated cells was indistinguishable from mock-treated cells. it has been shown that cargo internalised via caveolae can be delivered to acidic early endosomes. mock-treated (A) or pre-treated with 7.5 mM MCD (B) and then incubated with filipin and viewed by confocal microscopy. at the end of the infection the cells were labelled using Orab1 (anti-NS2) and scored for infection by confocal microscopy. level of infection of the drug-treated cells was normalised to the level of infection of the mock-treated cells. cells expressing wt or DN-dynamin-2 were identified by the GFP fusion tag. at 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with Alexa-568 transferrin. at 12 h post-transfection, the cells were incubated with BTV-1 for 15 minutes. the cells were then fixed and processed for confocal microscopy. transfected cells were infected with BTV-1 (m.o.i. = 1) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. cells were scored positive for transferrin or BTV-1 uptake. level of infection was normalised to level of uptake or infection by cells expressing wt dynamin-2 (wt) dynamin in BTV-1 infection, BHK cells were treated with the general dynamin inhibitor, dynasore [56]. Mock-treated and dynasore-treated cells were incubated with BTV-1, Alexa-568 labelled transferrin or Alexa-568 labelled dextran. dynasore effectively inhibited uptake of all three ligands. almost all of the drug treated cells showed no uptake of virus, transferrin or cells were mock-treated, or treated with the drug and successful disruption of actin filaments confirmed by confocal microscopy. Mock or drug-treated cells were allowed to internalise BTV-1 (for 0.5 h) in the presence of the drug. the cells were then fixed and processed for confocal microscopy. the cells were labelled using Orab1 (anti-NS2) and scored for infection by confocal microscopy. the level of infection of the drug-treated cells was normalised to the level of infection of the mock-treated cells. after 1 h incubation the cells were washed to remove excess unbound virus and inhibitor. cytochalasin-D was added to other cells immediately after virus inoculums were removed and co-incident with the addition of ammonium chloride. similar results were obtained using latrunculin-A in place of cytochalasin-D. the results confirm that BTV-1 infectious entry into BHK cells is actin dependent. BTV-1 is co-localised with dextran during cell-entry. the cells were then processed for confocal microscopy using PM10 to detect input virus (green) the cells were then processed for confocal microscopy using PM10. early- and recycling-endosomes were labelled by incubating the cells with transferrin during the final 15 minutes of virus uptake. other cells were double labelled for virus (as above) and LAMP-1 (a marker for late-endosomes and lysosomes) using Mab 4A1. at 15 minutes post-uptake, virus was not co-localised with LAMP-1. BTV-1 was pre-bound to BHK cells and internalised for 15, 30, or 120 minutes. cells processed for confocal microscopy using PM10 to detect input virus (green) panel (A) and (D) show transferrin uptake. panel (C) and (E) show merged images for the same cells. Alternatively, cells were double labelled for BTV-1 and LAMP-1. TV-1 delivery to acidic compartments was slower than expected for uptake by the clathrin pathway [53] during entry, BTV-1 did not co-localise with transferrin, a commonly used marker for CME. cell-entry and infection was not inhibited by expression of three different DN inhibitors of CME (AP180C, DN-Eps15 and DN-dynamin-2). LCMV and Kaposi's Sarcoma associated Herpesvirus are internalised by clathrin-independent mechanisms that result in virus delivery to late-endosomes without first passing through early-endosomes [65], [66], [67]. however, the uptake pathway used by LCMV appears distinct from that described here for BTV-1 entry into BHK cells. a DN mutant of the \u2018aa\u2019 splice variant of dynamin-2 does not inhibit BTV-1 uptake or infection of BHK cells. this DN mutant of the \u2018aa\u2019 splice variant of dynamin-2 does not inhibit BTV-1 uptake or infection of BHK cells. this DN mutant was shown to inhibit transferrin but not dextran uptake. a pathway for BTV-1 uptake and infection of BHK cells that is independent of clathrin and cholesterol requires dynamin. this pathway appears to deliver virus directly to late-endosomes/lysosomes without first passing through early-endosomes. it is likely that this broad tropism, and the ability of BTV to replicate in such evolutionary distant hosts results, in part from an ability to use multiple entry routes."}
