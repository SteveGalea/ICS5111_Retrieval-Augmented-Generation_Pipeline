{"summary": "community-acquired pneumonia has an annual incidence of 36\u201340 per 1,000 children below the age of 5 years and 11\u201316 per 1,000 in children 5\u201314 years of age. in the united states it is second only to injuries as the most common reason for hospitalization in children 18 years of age. despite its high incidence, diagnosis and management of pediatric CAP remains a significant challenge to clinicians. transcriptional profiles can differentiate viral from bacterial infections with up to 90% accuracy. Molecular distance to health (MDTH) provides a single numeric score that summarizes the global perturbation of the transcriptional profile of each patient compared to healthy controls. exclusion criteria included significant pre-existing medical conditions, use of immunomodulatory agents, prematurity 34 weeks in subjects younger than 2 years of age. healthy controls were enrolled during outpatient routine visits or minor elective surgical procedures not involving the respiratory tract. written informed consent was obtained from parents/guardians before enrollment. PCRs were performed on an ABI 7500 Real-Time PCR System. the assay targeted an 86 bp segment of the pyrogenic exotoxin B (speB) gene (Marcon et al., 2004) and the M. pneumoniae assay targeted a 76 bp segment of the P1 adhesin protein (p1ad) gene (Hardegger et al., 2000). children were categorized into four groups according to detection of a viral or bacterial pathogen. patients were included in the pyogenic bacteria group if a bacterial pathogen was identified by culture or PCR from blood or pleural fluid. patients were included in the respiratory virus group by a positive PCR result from a NP specimen. whole blood RNA was processed and hybridized into Illumina Human HT-12 v4 beadchips. llumina GenomeStudio software was used to subtract background and scale average samples' signal intensity. geneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, United States) was used to perform further normalization and analyses. CAP compared with healthy controls, which will aid in the calculations of the MDTH scores. the metric converts the global transcriptional perturbation measured in each patient sample into a numeric value that can be incorporated into analyses of clinical variables. data has been deposited in gene expression Omnibus number GSE103119. patients were reviewed for eligibility at the time of admission to the hospital. inclusion criteria included age 2 months to 18 years, evidence of acute infection, signs or symptoms of respiratory illness, and radiologic confirmation of lower respiratory tract disease. real-time PCR for S. pneumoniae was performed on a lightCycler\u00ae. the assay targeted an 86 bp segment of the pyrogenic exotoxin B (speB) gene. children were categorized into four groups according to detection of a viral or bacterial pathogen: (1) pyogenic bacteria, (2) M. pneumoniae, (3) respiratory viruses, or (4) undetermined. children were included in the pyogenic bacteria group if a bacterial pathogen was identified by culture or PCR from blood or pleural fluid. llumina GenomeStudio software was used to subtract background and scale average samples' signal intensity. transcripts were first selected if they were present in at least 10% of all samples. oxygen, non-invasive ventilation, and intubation were used as clinical markers of disease severity. the goal of these initial analyses was to identify genes that were significantly differentially expressed in these three groups of patients with CAP compared with healthy controls. we calculated the MDTH scores, a metric that converts the global transcriptional perturbation measured in each patient sample into a numeric value that can be integrated into analyses of clinical variables. analysis was conducted using SAS 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, United States) results Demographics and pathogen detection One hundred and eighty-eight previously healthy children hospitalized with CAP were enrolled between February 1, 2011 and may 15, 2012. healthy controls All patients Pyogenic bacteriaa M. pneumoniaeb Respiratory virusesc Undetermined (n = 39) (n = 152) (n = 16) (n = 78) (n = 17) Age (years)d, f 3.6 [1.1\u201310.9] 5.1 [2.1\u20138.0] 5.8 [2.8\u20137.4] 8.0 [4.6\u201311.5] 3.6 [1.5\u20136.3] 6.5 [2.2\u201313.6] Gender (M:F) 25:14 75 fever during hospitalizationd N/A 1 [0\u20132] 3 [1\u20134.8] 0 [0\u20132] 1 [0\u20131] LOS (days)d N/A 2 [1.3\u20133] 5.0 [3.8\u20138.8] 1.8 [1.1\u20132.4] 2.0 [1.2\u20132.7] 2.2 [1.6\u20133.3] a Pyogenic bacteria (PB) group includes 5 children with only PB, 10 children with PB+ Respiratory virus, and 1 child with PB+ Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 10, 62%) was the most frequent pyogenic bacterium detected, followed by S. pyogenes (n = 4, 25%), and S. aureus (n = 2, 13%) of 147 children tested for respiratory viruses, 125 viruses were detected in 98 (67%) children. rhinovirus/enterovirus (n = 57, 46%) was the most frequent virus detected. a total of 6,726 genes were differentially expressed in children with CAP. 952 (15%) genes were shared among all pathogen groups. 2,191 (35%) were specific to pyogenic bacteria, 651 (10%) were specific to respiratory viruses, and 327 (5%) were specific to M. pneumoniae. 8 healthy controls and 15 patients with bacterial CAP based on 5,675 transcripts (B) all transcripts were identified after applying a nonparametric test (Mann\u2013Whitney) (P 0.01), 1.25-fold change, and Benjamini\u2013Hochberg multiple-test correction. a total of 6,726 differentially expressed genes were identified in children with CAP due to pyogenic bacteria. variables of interest were significant in univariate analyses. univariate analyses showed higher MDTH was associated with longer LOS. this association was not significant in the multivariable assessment. for every 500-point increase in MDTH scores there was a 12% increased odds of LOS >2 days. a LOS, Length of hospitalization. b OR,odds ratio.
