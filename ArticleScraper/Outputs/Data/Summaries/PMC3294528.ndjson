{"summary": "a cross-sectional study comparing 3 ITDS was conducted in 3 urban tertiary-care hospital emergency departments in the united states. the 3 hospitals were selected because of their estimated patient volume of >200 patients per day. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) patients were enrolled in the study if they were willing to participate. patients who were nonambulatory, mentally incompetent, arrested or incarcerated, 18 years of age, or required immediate medical attention were excluded. data analysis Symptom questionnaire responses, oral temperature measurements, and ITDS-recorded data were entered into an Excel database and analyzed by using SAS Version 9.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC, USA) patient responses of \"Don\u2019t know\" to the question, \"Do you feel like you have a fever now\" were analyzed as \"No\" a cross-sectional study comparing 3 ITDS was conducted in 3 urban tertiary-care hospital emergency departments in the united states. the 3 hospitals were selected because of a potential high prevalence of fever compared with its prevalence in healthy populations. the study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) device selection ITDS were selected for evaluation through a competitive bidding process. 3 of 6 devices submitted to CDC met the above criteria. participants and Eligibility Adults were recruited consecutively among patients who sought care at 1 hospital in each city. a total sample size of 3,000 patients was needed for the study. Temperature Measurements The 3 ITDS were positioned at the optimal distance (2\u20133 m) from each participant. each ITDS camera field of view was preset to capture the patient\u2019s face and neck. patient self-reported fever was defined as an oral temperature >100\u00b0F (>37.8\u00b0C) room temperatures were recorded hourly by using a standard digital room thermometer. patients were given examples of trade and generic names of common antipyretic drugs. their responses, along with each patient\u2019s age and sex, date, and time of temperature measurement were recorded. positive predictive value (PPV) was compared with self-report. the proportion of patients identified as febrile by ITDS had a confirmed fever by oral temperature. toTherm and FLIR were significantly higher than those of Wahl. at fixed specificities, the sensitivities of each ITDS varied. n = 2,507 patients FLIR, n = 2,061 patients Wahl. 5.7 (4.1\u20137.3) 10.1 (7.4\u201312.8) Negative predictive value (95% CI) 99.6 (99.3\u201399.8) 99.5 (99.1\u201399.7) 99.3 (98.9\u201399.6) Febrile by either ITDS or self-report No. (%) identified as febrile by each method 597 (23.8) 586 (23.3) 793 (38.5) Sensitivity (95% CI) 93.8 (87.8\u201399.7) sensitivity for self-reported fever was 75%, specificity was 84.7%, and PPV was 10.1%. Sensitivities of the 3 ITDS at their respective optimal thresholds did not differ significantly from that of self-reported fever. sensitivity for self-reported fever was 75%, specificity was 84.7%, and PPV was 10.1%. n = 2,873 patients OptoTherm, n = 2,809 patients FLIR, n = 2,848 patients Wahl, n = 2,848 patients Gender Male mean temperature, \u00b0F (SD) 97.85 (0.91) 94.36 (1.25) 95.77 (1.33) 89.52 (2.40) Female mean temperature, \u00b0F (SD) 97.95 (0.87) 94.19 (1.27) 95.59 (1.40) 89. ptoTherm Thermal Imaging Systems and Infrared Cameras Inc., Sewickley, PA, USA) and Wahl Fever Alert Imager HSI2000S (Wahl Instruments Inc., asheville, NC, USA) were most strongly (p0.001) associated with the size of the gap between oral and ITDS temperature measurements. smaller differences between ITDS and oral temperatures were found among men than among women. 0.011 \u20130.160 0.019 \u20130.029 0.034 \u20130.001 0.005 Age squared \u20130.0002 0.0001 \u20130.0003 \u20130.0004 \u20130.002 0.0001 Site Albuquerque \u20130.498 0.915 \u20131.061 \u20130.214 0.058 4.256 \u20134.431 Atlanta \u20130.309 0.514 \u20130.603 0.302 \u20130.399 0.043 \u20130.149 Time of day. the FLIR and OptoTherm reliably identified elevated body temperatures. the high AUCs for these 2 systems suggest they can differentiate between febrile and afebrile persons with relatively high sensitivity and specificity at an optimal fever cutoff. the relatively high correlation with oral temperature measurement also supports the utility of these 2 ITDS. the preference for oral temperatures as reference is supported by an evaluation of methods for measuring body temperature. rectal temperatures were the most accurate of the peripheral thermometry methods, followed by oral, tympanic, and axillary temperature measurements. one fourth of febrile patients did not report having fever. only one tenth of those who reported having a fever were actually found to be febrile. our results probably underestimated the benefit of ITDS over self-reports of fever. sensitivity and specificity of screening by using ITDS are determined by the selected fever temperature cutoff, which tends to be 2\u20133 degrees lower than the standard fever threshold because of differences between skin and core temperatures. lowering OptoTherm\u2019s threshold from the optimal 95.7\u00b0F to 94.5\u00b0F would achieve almost 100% sensitivity but would reduce specificity to 63.6%. setting the cutoff to achieve very high sensitivity can result in many false positives. a higher ITDS temperature cutoff may be preferable in settings where confirmatory testing may not be feasible."}
