{"summary": "rotavirus is mediated by the outer capsid spike protein VP4 through its glycan binding domain, VP8*. previous studies have shown that some animal rotaviruses bind to terminal Sia residues on cell surfaces. some human rotaviruses interact with nonsialylated glycoconjugates. a group of unusual rotaviruses possessing the P[11] VP4 type and a G9 or G10 VP7 genotype has been associated with neonatal infections in india. of these, the G10P[11] rotaviruses were initially detected in diarrheal samples from cattle in many studies and in some asymptomatic infections in neonates (13\u201315). the understanding of the epidemiology of these viruses changed when a 4-year hospital surveillance study involving 1,300 tal infections is G9P[11], a bovine-human reassortant virus. all genes are of human rotavirus origin except VP4, which is of bovine rotavirus origin (23, 24). the predominance of a single genotype in this age-restricted population contrasts with the strain diversity seen among older children. the VP8* amino acid sequences of animal and human rotaviruses were compared to the VP8* amino acid sequences of other animal and human rotaviruses with known glycan partners. these included sialidase-sensitive animal rotavirus strains that bind to glycans with a terminal Sia moiety (rhesus rotaviruses RRV and SA11, porcine rotavirus CRW-8) rotavirus strains Wa (GI:333781), DS-1 (GI:28268531), and HAL1166 (GI: 452131) are shown. residues known to interact with Sia for the animal viruses RRV, SA11, and CRW-8. GST-VP8* P[11] was determined using a glycan array comprised of >600 glycans. the recombinant protein from neonatal G10P[11] N155 was used in decreasing concentrations (200, 20, 2.0, and 0.2 g/ml) in individual arrays. the hemagglutination titer was recorded as the highest dilution of sample that resulted in complete hemagglutination. a 10% suspension was prepared using 10 l of packed RBCs in 250 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.8) containing bovine serum albumin (1.25 mg/ml), NaCl (5 mM), and CaCl2 (4 mM) the neuraminidase treatment studies were carried single-transfectant CHO cells express the enzyme fucosyltransferase (Fut2) express the H antigen (H+/A/B) and B-type glycosyltransferase express the A antigen (H+/A+/B) polylactosamines were assayed on CHO cells by flow cytometry. increased infectivity on CHO cells is mediated by VP4. the origins of the VP4, VP7, and remaining genes in virus strains are listed below the strain. binding studies were carried out at 4\u00b0C for 30 min using 25 g of protein for 1 106 to 2 106 cells. binding studies also carried out following treatment of CHO cells with neuraminidase at 37\u00b0C for 1 h at a concentration of 50 mU per 106 cells. cells were grown to confluence on 96-well plates and inoculated with 2-fold dilutions of trypsin-activated virus. both N155 and N1509 were isolated from neonates with feed intolerance. the VP8* amino acid sequences of P[11] rotaviruses were compared to the VP8* amino acid sequences of other animal and human rotaviruses with known glycan partners. simian (Si) rotaviruses RRV (GI:61869) and SA11 (GI:61892), porcine (Po) rotavirus CRW-8 (GI:226699783), and human (Hu) rotavirus strains Wa (GI:333781), DS-1 (GI:28268531), and HAL1166 (GI: 452131) are shown. the purified GST-VP8* proteins were used in glycan array and hemagglutination assays. the carbohydrate binding specificity of GST-VP8* P[11] was determined using a glycan array comprised of >600 glycans. at 500 g, and 0.5% suspensions of each RBC type were prepared in 0.85% saline (pH 6.2) the GST-VP8* proteins were serially diluted on 96-well V-bottom plates (Nunc) and mixed with an equal volume of each RBC type. hemagglutination titer was recorded as the highest dilution of sample. cell lines and virus strains for binding and infectivity assays were performed on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells that differ in the production of HBGAs (7). the parental CHO cells do not express HBGAs (H/A/B) reassortant viruses differed in their overall genetic background. increased infectivity on H-antigen-expressing CHO cells is mediated by VP4. origins of VP4, VP7, and remaining genes in virus strains are listed below. buffered saline (pH 8.0) was labeled using an FITC antibody-labeling kit. the proteins were incubated with one vial of FITC reagent each at room temperature for 1 h with protection from light. binding studies were carried out at 4\u00b0C for 30 min using 25 g of protein for 1 106 to 2 106 cells. rotaviruses are known to bind glycans with a terminal Sia residue on cell surface glycans. the crystal structures of the VP8* of animal rotaviruses RRV and CRW-8 with bound Sia have been determined. the residues that interact with Sia have been identified. VP8* P[11] binds glycans with Gal1-4GlcNAc. potential glycan partners for VP8* P[11] were screened using a glycan array. GST-VP8* P[11] showed distinct binding to a number of glycans. the presence of an -1,2-linked fucose (H type II glycan) resulted in an increase in binding strength. the presence of an -1,2-linked fucose (H type II glycan) resulted in an increase in binding strength. glycan array results also indicate that VP8*P[11] can bind to extended polylactosamine glycans. man1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc1-2Man1-3)Man1-4GlcNAc1-4GlcNAc-Sp19 582 >6 83.18 Gal. 1-4GlcNAc1-3Gal1-4GlcNAc1-3Gal1-4GlcNAc-Sp0 163 3 9.03 Fuc1-2Gal1-4Gal1-4GlcNAc1-3Gal1-4GlcNAc-Sp0 (H type II) 75 3 (terminal fucose) 25.61 Neu5Ac2- 3Gal1-4GlcNAc1-3Gal1-4GlcNAc-Sp0 259 3 (terminal Si GST-VP8* P[11] hemagglutinates adult and cord blood erythrocytes. hemagglutination assays serve as a useful tool to assess the specificity and biological significance of glycan array data. GST-VP8* P[11] hemagglutinates adult and cord blood erythrocytes RBCs. no hemagglutination is indicated by 0. HA titers of adult human type O, type A, and type B RBCs. neuraminidase treatment resulted in an increased hemagglutination titer for VP8* P[11] from N155 and B223. in untreated RBCs, Sia may be masking additional sites for GST-VP8* P[11] binding. the enzyme Fut2 catalyzes the addition of a terminal fucose in -1,2 linkage to the LacNAc precursor. the addition of the H type II to A-type or B-type HBGA did not result in any further significant increase in virus titer. infectivity of rotaviruses increases with expression of H antigen. infection was carried out in parental CHO cells (H/A/B), single-transfectant cells expressing the Fut2 enzyme (H+/A/B) and double-transfectant cells with both Fut2 and A type glycosyltransferase (H+/A+/B+) neuraminidase treatment of CHO cells resulted in increased binding. no significant difference was observed with GST-VP8* P[14]. neuraminidase treatment of CHO cells resulted in increased binding. the bovine-origin P[11] VP4 is the key mediator of this virus-cell interaction. the VP8* sequence of P[11] rotaviruses is distinct in the glycan binding domain. the residues that interact with Sia have been identified. the VP8* crystal structures of two other human rotavirus strains have also been reported previously (2, 5, 6) the VP8* sequence of P[11] strains varied from the VP8* sequences of these strains. potential glycan partners for VP8* P[11] were screened using a glycan array comprising >600 glycans. rotavirus binding partners, such as GM1 and GD1a-like glycans, showed much lower binding (Table 1). the GST-VP8* P[11] bound with high affinity to the polylactosamine of N-glycans with no preference for the number of branches. the strength of binding was directly related to the length of the polylactosamine and less dependent on the terminal monosaccharide.

GST-VP8* P[11] binds all CHO cells. neuraminidase treatment resulted in increased hemagglutination with GST-VP8* P[11] Virus strain Reciprocal HA titera Without neuraminidase. infectivity assays on parental, H-type, and A-type CHO cells showed similar binding patterns using GST-VP8* P[11]. no significant difference in expression of polylactosamines between these cell lines. CHO cells do not differ in the levels of polylactosamine. parental and H-type CHO cells were assayed for polylactosamine. infectivity of rotaviruses in CHO cell lines genetically modified to express different glycans. human neonatal P[11] rotavirus strain N1509 (1.5 104 FFU/ml); bovine P[11] rotavirus strain B223 (5.2 103 FFU/ml). the y axis represents the fold difference in comparison to the results for the parental cells. the VP4 in the human neonatal rotaviruses are of bovine rotavirus origin (20, 24) infectivity was directly mediated by the bovine rotavirus-derived P[11] VP4. infectivity assays were carried out on parental and single-transfectant H type II CHO cells using SA11-4F, bovine G10P[11] rotavirus B223, and six reassortants of these two parental viruses. glycan-pathogen interactions play a key role in pathogenesis of several infectious agents. studies in rodents have demonstrated that glycosylation changes in the gut occur throughout the postnatal phase of development. glycan changes in the human neonatal gut have not been extensively studied. hemagglutination assays, binding studies, and differential infectivity on CHO cells corroborate the findings of the glycan array. hemagglutination assays, binding studies, and differential infectivity on CHO cells corroborate the findings of the glycan array. lectin binding studies on the parental and transfected CHO cells showed that polylactosamine levels did not change between the parental and transfected cells. this suggests that the increased infectivity observed in the transfected cells is due to the addition of H type II structures and not due to concomitant modifications in other glycan motifs. reassortant viruses possess a VP4 of bovine rotavirus origin (20, 24) reassortants derived using B223 and SA11-4F differ in their genetic makeup. the magnitude of the fold change was the highest for B223 in comparison to that for the reassortant viruses. the findings of this study suggest that neonatal immunization with this neonatal P[11] virus may prove effective, as these strains may be able to replicate more efficiently in the neonatal gut. this leads to questions of whether vaccine uptake and response may differ at different ages of vaccination depending on the VP4 genotype of the vaccine virus and glycan profile of the vaccinated infant."}
