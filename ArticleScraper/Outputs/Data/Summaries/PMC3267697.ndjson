{"summary": "HBoV is a newly discovered parvovirus associated with acute respiratory tract illness (ARTI) and gastrointestinal illness. a single lineage of HBoV was detected among a wide age distribution of patients with ARTI. human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) and coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) have been identified. HBoV is a single-stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) virus with a small genome size of approximately 5.3 kilo-bases (kb) 2811 respiratory samples were collected from patients with ARTI. patients' ages ranged from 9 days to 84 years. patients' ages ranged from 9 days to 84 years. time PCR reaction buffer was also purchased from Taqman real-time PCR. the amplified NP1 gene target sequence (2545-2611 nt) was inserted into the pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa) and used as a positive control for quantification analysis. after 1% agarose gel electrophoresis using a Qiagen. purified DNA was then sequenced and assembled using DNASTAR-SeqMan software. PCR amplification and sequencing were conducted at least twice to ensure sequence accuracy. phylogenetic trees were inferred from VP1/VP2 (3056-5071 nt), NS1 (253-2172 nt), NP1 gene (2410-3069 nt) and complete genome data (1-5299 nt) using neighbor-joining method. all tests were two-tailed and p 0.05 was considered statistical significant. amplification was performed using 10 pmol of primers, 3 pmol of probe and 5 l DNA in a final volume of 25 l. the amplified NP1 gene target sequence (2545-2611 nt) was inserted into the pMD18-T vector and used as a positive control for quantification analysis. DNA template (2 l) was added to the Pfu DNA polymerase reaction mixture (Fermentas) in a final volume of 25 l and PCR amplified. products were purified after 1% agarose gel electrophoresis using a Qiagen. PCR amplification and sequencing were conducted at least twice to ensure sequence accuracy. complete genomes of HBoV, HBoV2 and HBoV3 from different countries and regions. phylogenetic trees were inferred from VP1/VP2 (3056-5071 nt), NS1 (253-2172 nt), NP1 gene (2410-3069 nt) and complete genome data (1-5299 nt) using the neighbor-joining method. the 65 positive patients were aged between 54 days and 70 years. four HBoV-positive adults were 19, 22, 60 and 70 years-old respectively. low positive rates of 0.3% (1/369) were detected in march 2010. high positive rates of 4.8% (8/166) were found in may 2010. the highest frequency of 16.9% (11/65), followed by RSV with 7.7% (5/65) (Table 2). The clinical characteristics of the patients are listed in Table 3. Most patients presented with symptoms of upper respiratory tract illness (URTI), including cough (93.8%) and expectoration (40.0%). bStatistical difference between \"Single HBoV\" and \"Co-pathogens\" cIncluding phlegm rale, wheeze rale, bubbling rale, and rhonchi. single HBoV: detected with single HBoV, without other 16 potential pathogens. abnormal pulmonary breathing sounds and dyspnea were detected in 35 (53.9%) and 30 (46.2%) of 65 patients. nineteen (29.2%) were diagnosed as pneumonia by chest radiography. phylogenetic analysis of HBoV-GU338055 genome (A), VP1/VP2 genes (B), NP1 gene (C) and NS1 gene (D). positive rates were 4.1% (28/687) for 0-1 year-olds, 4.8% (16/335) for 1-2 year-olds, 4.4% (10/225) for >2-3 year-olds, 1.7% (2/121) for >3-4 year-olds, 1.3% (1/80) for four HBoV-positive adults were 19, 22, 60 and 70 years-old. the ratio of 3 year-old patients ranged from 20.2% to 66.5%. low positive rates of 0.3% (1/369) were detected in march 2010. the clinical characteristics of HBoV-positive patients are listed in Table 3. most patients presented with symptoms of upper respiratory tract illness (URTI), including cough (93.8%) and expectoration (40.0%) and 44 (67.7%) patients presented with symptoms of fever (38\u00b0C) bStatistical difference between \"Single HBoV\" and \"Co-pathogens\" cIncluding phlegm rale, wheeze rale, bubbling rale, moist rale, and rhonchi. Abnormal pulmonary breathing sounds and dyspnea were detected in patients. nineteen (29.2%) were diagnosed as pneumonia by chest radiography. 13/19 (68.4%) pneumonia patients were co-detected with one or two other pathogens. a statistic difference was found for the symptom of \"pneumonia\" new tab Phylogenetic analysis of HBoV-GU338055 genome (A), VP1/VP2 genes (B), NP1 gene (C) and NS1 gene (D). HBoV is a novel parvovirus first described in 2005 by Allander and colleagues. the male:female ratio in the HBoV-positive patients did not differ significantly from the HBoV-negative patients. seven major symptoms (cough, fever (38\u00b0C), abnormal pulmonary breath sound, dyspnea, expectoration, snivel and pneumonia) had the highest ratio (ratio > 10%) and were common as URTI and LRTI. group I, HBoV; group II, HBoV2; group III, HBoV3 and GU338055 were located in group I. this lack of information is largely because of the inability of HBoV to grow in standard cell lines. authors declare that they have no competing interests. 1471-2334/11/345/prepub Acknowledgements The state major infectious disease research program provided financial support for this work."}
