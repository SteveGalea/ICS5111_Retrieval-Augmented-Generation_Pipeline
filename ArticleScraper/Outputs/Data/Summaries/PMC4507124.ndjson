{"summary": "rotaviral diarrhea is the major etiologic factor of severe diarrheal disease, often associated with fever, nausea, and dehydration in infants and young children. it has been estimated that rotaviral diarrhea may be responsible for 527,000 child deaths every year, the majority of which (>85%) occur in developing countries. there are 24 G genotypes and 33 P genotypes. of the genotypes described to date, 12 G and 15 P genotypes are known to be involved in human infections. capsid proteins VP7 and VP4 have very high diversity among strains. a new rotavirus vaccine (51) composed of the live rotavirus strain RIX4414 was licensed in Mexico by GlaxoSmithKline. there is no effective vaccine program in many developing countries. there is no effective vaccine program in many developing countries. the secondary structure of the model peptide was predicted by phyre2 (www.sbg.bio.ic.ac.uk/phyre2/) (24), PHD (http: //npsa-pbil.Ibcp. Fr/cgibin/npsa_automat. Pal) age=/NPSA/npsa_phd.html) (45), PSIPRED (31), and Jpred (www.compbio.dunde prediction of T-cell epitopes In order to identify linear epitopes, the primary sequence of the peptide was submitted to ABCpred (www.imtech.res.in/raghava/ctlpred/) nHLAPred (www.imtech.res.in/raghava/hladr4pred) (3) was used for investigation and identification of T-helper epitopes in the peptide. prediction of conformational B-cell epitopes: Ellipro (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/elliPro/iedb_input) and Discotope 1.2 (http://tools.immuneepitope.org/tools/elliPro/iedb_input) were used to predict conformation of diagnosable epitopes for B lymphocytes. the results were prepared by Pyre2 and displayed with Hex. this peptide includes 28.4% -helix, 10.5% -sheet, 4.2% turn, and 66.5% coil. conformational B-cell epitopes were predicted with Ellipro. 793.0 9.99 2 11* TSLWKEMQYNRDIIIR 46 16 0.713 2,066.4 8.28 2 12* IDFKTLKNLNDNACTE 63 16 0.688 1,839.0 4.56 1,2 Antigenic motifs were confirmed by different programs; hydrophilic motifs are marked with an asterisk. ElliPro associates each predicted epitope with a score, defined as a PI value averaged over epitope residues. for each residue, a PI value is defined as percentage of the protein atoms enclosed in the ellipsoid. all residues that are outside the 90% ellipsoid will have PI=9 (or 0.9 in ElliPro) motif 4 (_:M26, _:D12, _:F14, _:V15, _:D16) with a score of 0.762. motif 5 (_:K69, _:N70, _:L71, _:L71, _:D73, _:A75, _:P86, _:I87, _:N89, _:R91, _:V93 different programs were used to predict T-cell epitopes in the proposed peptide. the various programs detected identical motifs. the various programs detected identical motifs. five types of HLA (HLA-B*3701 HLA-B40, HLA-B60, HLA-B61, HLA-Cw*0602) were shared. RFKIDFKTL was identified by HLA (HLA-B*0702, MHC-Kb, MHC-Kd, HLA-Cw*0401) the role of humoral immunity against rotavirus has been demonstrated in multiple studies (33,50,53) the role of humoral immunity against rotavirus has been demonstrated in multiple studies (33,50,53) this type of vaccine could improve health in developing and underdeveloped countries."}
