{"summary": "MERS-CoV is a highly pathogenic coronavirus first identified in the Middle East in 2012 (1, 2). cases have been concentrated on the Arabian Peninsula, but a large travel-associated outbreak in south Korea in 2015 highlights that MERS-CoV remains a global concern. several studies utilizing ectopically expressed protein and reporter systems have identified NS4a, NS4b, and NS5 as putative interferon antagonists. more recent studies utilizing recombinant MERS-CoV have more completely elucidated the functions of some of these proteins, but conflicted with early reporter studies. NS4a prevents phosphorylation of PKR and induction of IFN and interferon-stimulated gene expression. PKR activation does not result in phosphorylation of eIF2 (eukaryotic initiation factor 2) or translation arrest in A549 cells. NS4a does not play a significant role in OAS-RNase L antagonism during MERS-CoV infection. deletion mutants MERS-NS4a and MERS-NS4ab were generated from the MERS-CoV infectious clone derived from the MERS-EMC2012 strain (27). NS4a was generated by altering the start codon (ATGATT) and adding an in-frame stop codon 10 codons downstream (TGGTGA) to ablate synthesis of the NS4a protein. a549DPP4 cells were infected at an MOI of 10 with WT MERS-CoV, MERS-NS4a, MERS-NS4ab, MERS-NS4ab, or MERS-NS4bNLSmut or mock infected. cells were prepared at 24 and 48 h postinfection, analyzed by SDS-PAGE. pCAGGS vector in A549 cells detecting NS4b proteins by immunofluorescence staining. mutant proteins expressed NS4b proteins with mutations of the RKR motif, the downstream KRR motif, and a previously undescribed basic motif. mutations of the central (KKLR) and downstream (KRR) motifs into the MERS-CoV infectious clone were engineered to generate MERS-NS4bNLSmut. NS4a colocalizes with dsRNA around replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) previous studies have shown that overexpressed NS4a binds to dsRNA. NS4a is broadly cytoplasmic when overexpressed in uninfected cells. NS4a and NS4b deletion mutants are modestly attenuated in A549DPP4 cells. NS4a and NS4b deletion mutants are modestly attenuated in a549DPP4 cell. deletion of NS4a and NS4b does not disrupt critical aspects of the viral life cycle. NS4a and NS4b mutants are attenuated in IFN competent cells. replication was quantified as in panel A. NS4a and NS4b modestly suppress IFN expression. we infected them with Sendai virus (SeV), Sindbis virus (SINV) and WT MERS-CoV. NS4a and NS4b antagonize IFN expression. RNA was harvested, and gene expression was expressed as fold change. we infected A549DPP4 cells with WT MERS-CoV, MERS-NS4a, and MERS-NS4ab. we compared gene expression of IFN and selected ISGs by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) there was no significant induction of type I IFN. 4b localizes primarily to the nucleus, suggesting additional functions. previous studies suggested that NS4b localization might be important for suppressing IFN expression (15), but no previous studies have specifically addressed the role of its catalytic activity in IFN antagonism (30). Statistical significance for mutant virus replication versus WT was determined by two-way ANOVA. gene expression over mock-infected cells was measured by RT-qPCR. data are from one representative of three independent experiments. NS4b antagonizes IFN expression independently of RNase L activation. mERS-NS4bH182R and MERS-NS4bNLSmut induced greater IFNL1, OAS2 and IFIT2 expression than WT MERS-CoV. RNA was assessed for rRNA degradation using an Agilent Bioanalyzer. NS4a does not contribute to OAS-RNase L antagonism during MERS-CoV infection. infection with MERS-NS4ab did not induce increased rRNA degradation. absence of NS4a alone is not enough to activate RNase L in this cell type. NS4a has both functional similarities to and differences from other viral dsRNA binding proteins. we investigated whether NS4a antagonizes the dsRNA binding antiviral effector protein kinase R (PKR) during MERS-CoV infection in A549DPP4 cells. NS4a, but not WT MERS-CoV, induced PKR phosphorylation. despite the activation of PKR, we did not detect phosphorylation of eIF2 above background levels. proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies against phosphorylated PKR (p-PKR), PKR, phosphorylated eIF2 (p-eIF2), eIF2, MERS-CoV N, and GAPDH. at 18 and 24 h postinfection, cells were treated with puromycin (10 g/ml) for 10 min. 4a-infected A549DPP4 cells compared to WT MERS-CoV. PKR phosphorylation did not induce downstream translation arrest. recombinant NS4a and NS4b MERS-CoV mutants were generated from the MERS-CoV infectious clone. human cells expressing the MERS-CoV receptor DPP4 (A549DPP4) were infected with mutants at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 10. protein lysates were harvested at 24 and 48 h postinfection (hpi) to assess protein expression by Western blotting. as expected, NS4a is not synthesized during infection with MERS-NS4a. two mutant viruses encode NS4b with a catalytically inactive phosphodiesterase domain. the NS4b NLS was previously described as bipartite (RKR11KRR), with the first basic motif more potently determining nuclear localization (12, 16) mutation of the RKR motif without causing amino acid changes in ORF4a is impossible. cells were fixed 24 h postinfection and stained with anti-NS4b rabbit serum and goat anti-rabbit AF594 secondary antibody. NS4b expressed during MERS-CoV infection is expressed in the nucleus. NS4b exhibits predominantly cytoplasmic localization, as expected. NS4a colocalizes with dsRNA and NS4a around replication/transcription complexes (RTCs) during MERS-CoV infection. dsRNA and NS4a appear more broadly distributed. sensitivity of the assay is insufficient to detect all of the nsp8. we harvested supernatant at predetermined times postinfection. all viruses replicated with equivalent kinetics to WT MERS-CoV. deletion of NS4a and/or NS4b modestly attenuated MERS-CoV replication in A549DPP4 cells at an MOI of 1. NS4a and NS4b modestly suppress IFN expression. previous studies of NS4a and NS4b have conflicted on the role of these proteins in suppressing the IFN response during MERS-CoV infection. expression of the indicated genes in infected/mock-infected cells was calculated as in panel A. IFNL1, IFNB, OAS2 and IFIT2 mRNA levels were quantified by qRT-PCR and calculated over mock-infected cells. NS4b is a novel IFN antagonist. previously reported that NS4b is a member of the 2H-phosphoesterase superfamily of proteins. NS4b localizes primarily to the nucleus, suggesting additional functions. RT-PCR analysis showed that mutation of either the catalytic site or NLS results in significantly increased type III IFN expression during MERS-CoV infection. supernatants were collected at indicated times postinfection and infectious virus quantified by plaque assay. A549mCEACAM-1 cells were mock treated or infected with WT MHV or MHV-NS2H126R at an MOI of 5. RNA was harvested at 6 and 12 h postinfection. both viruses induced slightly more IFNL1 expression than we observed for MERS-CoV. KO cells were mock treated or infected with SINV at an MOI of 1 with SINV. RNA was harvested at 24 h postinfection. dsRNA binding proteins encoded by viruses such as vaccinia virus. NS4a may contribute to antagonize activation of the antiviral OAS-RNase L pathway during MERS-CoV infection. we infected A549DPP4 cells at an MOI of 5, harvested RNA 48 h postinfection. we included SINV as a control for robust RNase L activation (32) A549DPP4 cells were mock infected with WT MERS-CoV, MERS-NS4a, MERS-NS4ab, MERS-NS4ab, MERS-NS4bH182R, or SINV (MOI = 1). RNA was harvested at 48 h postinfection for MERS-CoV infection and at 24 h postinfection for SINV infection. PKR by MERS-NS4a in A549DPP4 cells is not sufficient to engage downstream elements of this pathway. SINV infection promotes robust phosphorylation of PKR and eIF2 in the same cells. lack of eIF2 phosphorylation is not due to a deficiency of this pathway in the same cells. data are from one representative of four (A), three (B) or two (C and D) independent experiments. we did not detect eIF2 phosphorylation by immunoblotting. but we wanted to confirm that PKR activation during MERS-NS4a infection does not mediate translation arrest in A549DPP4 cells. deletion of MERS-CoV accessory proteins from recombinant viruses leads to enhanced activation of antiviral pathways. this is in contrast to early studies utilizing overexpression and reporter plasmids or ectopic expression from heterologous virus. NS4b is the first viral phosphodiesterase known to suppress antiviral pathways in addition to RNase L. NS4b is the first viral phosphodiesterase known to suppress antiviral pathways in addition to RNase L, distinguishing it from phosphodiesterases found in other coronavirus subgenera. mutation does not reduce NS4b levels below an effective concentration (23, 34, 41) we presume that this faster-migrating protein was not detected in NS4b mutant-infected cells due to its lower expression level relative to full-length NS4b. we speculate it could be a breakdown product of full-length NS4b. inactive suggests the possibility MERS-CoV encodes additional antagonists. nsp15 has been described as contributing to evasion of multiple dsRNA-sensing pathways. a previous study showed that ectopically expressed NS4a inhibits PKR activation. the lack of robust replication phenotypes has identified novel and important virus-host interactions that contribute in important ways to maintenance of MERS-CoV in its ecological niche and possibly during infection of the human respiratory tract. future work on MERS-CoV accessory proteins should more fully answer the question of how these proteins contribute to replication under immune pressure and to pathogenesis. the delta4AB primer uses the PacI site just upstream of NS4a. the deletion removes nucleotides 25844 to 26794 in the MERS genome. the remainder of the primer\u2019s sequence is from positions 26795 to 26819 in the MERS genome. plasmid encoding cDNA of DPP4 was purchased from Sino Biological. amplicon was cloned into pCR4-TOPO TA cloning vector. fragment containing DPP4-V5 was digested by XbaI and SalI restriction enzymes. lentiviruses pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) to establish the gene knock-in cells as previously described (32) cells were subjected to hygromycin (1 mg/ml) selection for 3 days and single-cell cloned. cells were screened for DPP4 expression and susceptibility to MERS-CoV replication. dsRNA was detected using commercial antibody J2 at 1:1,000 and nsp8 using anti-nsp8 guinea pig serum at 1:500. dsRNA was detected using commercial antibody J2 at 1:1,000 and nsp8 using anti-nsp8 guinea pig serum at 1:500. goat anti-rabbit AF647 (catalog no.
