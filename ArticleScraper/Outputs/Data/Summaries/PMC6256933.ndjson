{"summary": "the whole human genome seems to encode 20,000\u201325,000 protein-coding genes. certain mutations will lead to dysfunctional proteins which may give rise to diseases. to find some new method of mutation assay which can simultaneously identify all these types of variations is most desirable. the circularizable oligonucleotides probe was comprised of four regions: primer region, solid region, template region and probe region. a DNA-chip based on streptavidin-coated microwells was used to detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms using molecular DNA switches. the circularized probe (C-probe) was amplified by phi29 DNA polymerase to generate multimeric single stranded DNA. the amplification products were hybridized with FPs and solid probes that were immobilize to the surface of glass slide. the fluorescent signals can be detected by scanner. the RCA reaction produced many bands of different sizes from 70 bps to the loading well. the slow migrating DNA and the DNA in the loading well were replicated intermediates containing single-stranded loops and double stranded loops. chip 5-NH2-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGCTGAGAACGGGAAG-3 SSB. fluorescent probe 5-GCACTCGACTTGCTTGTGTGCATGC-3 FP. RCA products (A and B) were shown to detect their artificial templates. some middle sequence of the template TB is same as HIV cDNA. some middle sequence of the template TB is same as HIV cDNA, so the template TB was replaced by HIV cDNA. RCA reaction was performed by using phi29 DNA polymerase with strand displacing activity. phi29 produces have high molecular weight material that hardly enters the gel. phi29 produces have high molecular weight material that hardly enters the gel. RCA products (A and B) were shown to detect their artificial templates. phi29 DNA polymerase was replaced by Taq DNA polymerase. the combination of products of OCPA and OCPB can hybridize respectively with SSA or SSB. the method employs two C-probes to confer highly accurate mutation discrimination. 3-Aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES, 99%) was purchased from aldrich. microscope slides were used as PCR reaction containers. oligonucleotide probes were designed especially with 80 to 90 nucleotides. RCA reactions were performed in a 50 L volume containing 29 DNA polymerase (20 U), 400 M deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, 40 pmol of each RCA primer (CP), and 5 L of the original ligation mix. the RCA cocktail was heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by incubation at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min and heating at 90 \u00b0C for 10 min to terminate the reaction. spotting solutions were obtained by dissolving probes (SSA or SSB) in 0.1M phosphate buffered saline buffer (pH 7.4) for 2 h. the slides were thoroughly washed twice with methanol, acetone and deionized distilled water, and dried. RCA amplification products combining with 10L Hybridization buffer were incubated in PCR tube. 10 L mix were spotted on above glass slides. microarray hybridization was conducted in a moist hybridization chamber under a cover slip at 42 \u00b0C for 2 h. gonucleotide probes were designed especially with 80 to 90 nucleotides (nt) in length, consisting of four adjacent target complementary sequences (15 to 20 nt) a region to facilitate the loop formation was parted, which could be ligated with T4 DNA ligase according to the target complementary sequences. RCA reactions were performed in a 50 L volume containing 29 DNA polymerase (20 U), 400 M deoxynucleoside triphosphate mix, 40 pmol of each RCA primer (CP), and 5 L of the original ligation mix. the RCA cocktail was heated at 95 \u00b0C for 5 min, followed by incubation at 65 \u00b0C for 30 min and heating at 90 \u00b0C for 10 min to terminate the reaction. glass slides were incubated at room temperature for 2 h and at 37 \u00b0C for 2 h. the slides were soaked twice in 0.1% SDS for 2 min at room temperature. the probe array can be used for immediately hybridization on a solid surface. the slide was rinsed and washed with 6 SSC- 0.1% SDS buffer for 1 min, 6 SSC buffer for 1 min, 2 SSC and dried by a flow of nitrogen gas. the DNA-chip could be scanned with the Tecan LS-300."}
