{"summary": "MERS-CoV has infected over 1,100 people, with a case fatality rate of 38% (1, 2). an envelope-anchored spike protein mediates coronavirus entry into host cells. it then fuses membranes through its S2 subunit (6\u20138) for membrane fusion, the spike must be cleaved at the S1/S2 boundary by one or more host proteases (9\u201313) the second region is a motif for human endosomal cysteine proteases (hECP motif) (17, 18), but the motif Ala763-Phe764-Asn765 in MERS-CoV spike corresponds to asn762-Tyr763-Thr764 in HKU4 spike. residue differences in the two human protease motifs may affect the capabilities of the spikes to mediate viral entry into human cells. to evaluate potential genetic changes required for HKU4 to infect human cells, we introduced two single mutations, S746R and N762A, into HKU4 spike. to confirm that the S746R mutation restored the hPPC motif, we produced retroviruses pseudotyped with HKU4 spike (referred to as HKU4 pseudoviruses) mutations in hPPC and hECP motifs in coronavirus spikes have shown dramatic effects on viral entry into human cells. both of these motifs play critical roles in HKU4- and MERS-CoV-spike-mediated entry into human cells. mutant and wild-type spikes were lysed and subjected to Western blot analysis. each of the spikes was run in two lanes that alternate between samples. the experiment was repeated in a separate gel. wild-type HKU4 pseudoviruses failed to enter human cells. reengineered hPPC and hECP motifs enabled hKU4 spike to be activated by human endogenous proteases. this enabled HKU4 spike to bypass the need for exogenous proteases to enter human cells. HEK293T cells were treated with endosomal cysteine protease inhibitor (ECP) inhibitor (E-64d) both of the inhibitors were used for MERS-CoV pseudoviruses bearing both of the mutations. human proprotein convertase (PPC) inhibitor and endosomal cysteine protease (ECP) inhibitor both blocked human cell entry of HKU4 pseudoviruses bearing the reengineered hPPC motif and the reengineered hECP motif. this result verified that the gained capability of HKU4 pseudoviruses to enter human cells was due to the reengineered human protease motifs in HKU4 spike. PPC inhibitor and ECP inhibitor both blocked human cell entry of wild-type MERS-CoV pseudoviruses. however, the mutations in the mutant hPPC and hECP motifs together eliminated MERS-CoV-spike-mediated viral entry into human cells. these results demonstrate that the two functional human protease motifs in MERS-CoV spike played a critical role in the bat-to-human transmission of MERS-CoV. most of HKU4- and MERS-CoV-spike-mediated pseudovirus entry into bat cells could be blocked by the ECP inhibitor. this suggests that bat endosomal cysteine proteases activate coronavirus spikes bearing a glycosylated hECP motif. the molecular and structural differences between human and bat hECPs accounting for their functional differences will be investigated in future research. pseudovirus entry mediated by wild-type HKU4 spike (for panels A and B) or wild-type MERS-CoV spike (for panels C and D) in the absence of the inhibitor was taken as 100%. understanding molecular mechanisms for cross-species transmissions of viruses is critical for evaluating emerging disease potentials. these mutations increased the capability of SARS-CoV spike to bind human receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. different entry factors appear to have played the most critical roles in the cross-species transmission of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV spike."}
