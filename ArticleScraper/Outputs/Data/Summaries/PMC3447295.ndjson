{"summary": "as of July 2010, WHO has reported 501 confirmed human cases of avian influenza A/(H5N1) which resulted in 287 deaths worldwide. the statistics for the H1N1 2009 outbreak have so far included 214 countries with a total reported number of infections and deaths of 419,289 and 18,239, respectively. the nation's ability to mitigate a pandemic influenza depends on the available emergency response resources and infrastructure. the modeling efforts have focused on combining pharmaceutical and nonpharmaceutical interventions in search for synergistic strategies. most of such approaches attempt implementing a form of social distancing followed by application of pharmaceutical measures. a 2006-07 initiative by MIDAS [42] cross-validated the models by simulating the city of Chicago, with 8.6M inhabitants. underlying simulation model mimics the disease and population dynamics of each of the affected regions. as the pandemic spreads from region to region, the optimization model distributes mitigation resources, including stockpiles of vaccines and antiviral and administration capacities. the optimization model allocates resources to the new outbreak region (actual distribution) and unaffected regions (virtual distribution) daily statistics is collected for each ongoing region. as a regional outbreak is contained, its societal and economic costs are calculated. the model collects detailed statistics, including number of infected, recovered, deceased, and quarantined cases. for a contained outbreak, its societal and economic costs are calculated. the economic cost includes the cost of medical expenses of the recovered and deceased. the simulation tracks the total number of infectious cases, n g, present in the group. it is assumed that each infectious case generates r g per t unit of time new contacts [46], chosen randomly from the pool of susceptibles present in the group. mortality for influenza-like diseases is a complex process affected by many factors and variables. the time of death can sometimes be weeks following the disease episode. we adopted an age-based form of the mortality probability of infected i. the degree of risk perception can be influenced by the negative experience developed during previous pharmaceutical campaigns [72, 73], as well as by public fear and rumors [74, 75]. nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) includes social distancing and travel restrictions. model seeks to minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks, spreading from the ongoing locations. the predictive mechanism of the optimization model is based on a set of regression equations obtained using single-region simulation models. X h k = h k 0 + i R h k i q i k + i, m R, i m h k i q i k + i, m R, i m h k i m q i k q m k, (3) where i denotes the regression coefficient associated with resource i and im is the regression coefficient for the interaction between resources the total outbreak probability for unaffected region k can be found as p k = lBn p lk. the total outbreak probability for unaffected region k can be found as p k = lBn p lk. h V h k n, (7) where m h is total medical cost of an infected case in age group h over his/her disease period, w h is total cost of lost wages of an infected case in age group h. w h is cost of lost lifetime wages of a deceased case in age group h, and w h is daily cost of lost wages of a non-infected case in age group h who complies with 2.4. Solution Algorithm The solution algorithm for our dynamic predictive simulation optimization (DPO) model is given below. 1) Estimate regression equations for each region using the single-region simulation model. 2) Begin the cross-regional simulation model. cross-regional simulation model is initialized by creating population entities and mixing groups, for each region. a pandemic is started by an infectious case injected into a randomly chosen region. as the infected cases start seeking medical help, a new regional outbreak is detected. resource distribution is then determined and returned to the single-region model. each individual is assigned a set of attributes such as age, gender, parenthood, workplace, infection susceptibility, and probability of travel. each person is also assigned t time-discrete (e.g., t = 1 hour) weekday and weekend schedules, which depend on: (i) person's age, parenthood, and employment status. we assume that L i(t) is distributed exponentially with mean 1/ i(t) where i(t) represents the instantaneous force of infection applied to susceptible i at time t. the probability that susceptible i will develop infection at time t + t is then given as P L i ( t ) t = 1 e i ( t ) t. a recovered case develops full immunity but continues circulating in the region. the model incorporates a certain delay for deploying field responders. PHI includes vaccination and antiviral application. for CFR values below 0.1% (Categories 2 and 3), voluntary at-home isolation is implemented. for CFR values exceeding 1.0% (Categories 4 and 5), all the above measures are implemented. the effectiveness of social distancing is affected by some of the behavioral factors listed above. the simulation tracks the total number of infectious cases, n g, present in the group. it is assumed that each infectious case generates r g per t unit of time new contacts [46], chosen randomly from the pool of susceptibles present in the group. at the end of the latency phase, she enters the infectious phase. at the end of the latency phase, she enters the period leading to a health outcome. at the end of the latency phase, she enters the period leading to a health outcome. both vaccination and antiviral application are affected by a number of sociobehavioral factors. the conformance level of the population at risk can be affected by the demographics and income level. nonpharmaceutical intervention (NPI) includes social distancing and travel restrictions. the objective of the model is to allocate some of the available mitigation resources to the new outbreak region while reserving the rest of the quantities for potential outbreak regions. the model seeks to progressively minimize the impact of ongoing outbreaks and the expected impact of potential outbreaks. Yhk = h k = h k 0 + i R h k i q i k + i, m R, i m h k i q i k + i, m R, i m h k i m q i k q m k, (3) where i denotes the regression coefficient associated with resource i and im is the regression coefficient for the interaction h j n = n X h j, Y h j n = n Y h j, D h j n = n Y h j, V h j n = n V h j. we use the following regression model to estimate the probability of pandemic spread from affected region l to unaffected region k. the total outbreak probability for unaffected region k can be found as h Y h k n + h H w h D h k n + h H w h V h k n, (7) where m h is total medical cost of an infected case in age group h over his/her disease period. w h is cost of lost lifetime wages of a deceased case in age group h, and w h is cost of lost wages of a non-infected case in age the set of constraints assure that for each resource i, the total quantity allocated does not exceed the total resource availability at the nth decision epoch. the objective function and the availability constraints are nonlinear in the decision variables. a sample outbreak scenario was run for a period (up to 180 days) until the daily infection rate approached near zero. a basic unit of time for population and disease dynamics models was taken to be t = 1 hour. a basic unit of time for population and disease dynamics models was taken to be t = 1 hour. the values of age-dependent base instantaneous infection probabilities were adopted from [46]. the disease natural history included a latent period of 29 hours (1.21 days), an incubation period of 46 hours (1.92 days), an infectiousness period from 29 to 127 hours (1.21 to 5.29 days) and a period leading to health outcome from 127 to 240 hours (5.29 to 10 days) single-region simulation models were calibrated using two common measures of pandemic severity. the basic reproduction number (R 0) and the infection attack rate (IAR) the value of R 0 was calculated as the average reproduction number of a typical generation in the early stage of the pandemic. antiviral for a mass prophylactic reduction of infection susceptibility due to limited antiviral availability [9] and the risk of emergence of antiviral resistant transmissible virus strains [26]. the immunity development period for the vaccine was taken as 10 days [61]. table 4 summarizes the total vaccine and antiviral requirements for each region. per capita costs of lost productivity and medical expenses were adopted from [52] and adjusted for inflation for the year of 2010 [90]. figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the policy comparison in the form of the 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the average total pandemic cost. figure 7 also shows the policy comparison using the 95% CI for the average total pandemic cost, calculated using the pandemic statistics, and the per capita costs from Table 5. the difference in the policy performance is particularly noticeable at the lower levels of resource availability. the variability in the performance of the policy is generally smaller than that of the myopic policy. in general, for both strategies, the performance variability decreases with higher availability of resources. the performance of both policies is somewhat identical for low antiviral efficacy (between 0% and 30%) however, the performance of the policy improves consistently as increases which can be attributed to a more discretionary allocation of the antiviral stockpile by the DPO policy. for both policies, there was no significant difference when the delay was between 24 and 48 hours. however, for the delay values exceeding 48 hours, the average number of deaths and total cost increased at a high rate. the values of age-dependent base instantaneous infection probabilities were adopted from [46]. the disease natural history included a latent period of 29 hours (1.21 days), an incubation period of 46 hours (1.92 days), an infectiousness period from 29 to 127 hours (1.21 to 5.29 days), and a period leading to health outcome from 127 to 240 hours. the value of R 0 was calculated as the average reproduction number of a typical generation in the early stage of the pandemic. for the four regions, the average baseline value of R 0 was 2.54, which represented a high transmissibility scenario. an outbreak was considered contained, if the daily infection rate did not exceed five cases, for seven consecutive days. an outbreak was considered contained, if the daily infection rate did not exceed five cases, for seven consecutive days. the simulation code was developed using C++. 305,036 679,181 241,522 76,007

different levels of resource availability, in the testbed scenario involving four regions, with the Hillsborough as the initial outbreak region. the average number of regional outbreaks for both policies shows a downward trend, for both DPO and myopic policies, as the total resource availability increases from 20% to 80%. the impact was measured separately by the change in the total pandemic cost and the number of deaths. factors under consideration included: antiviral efficacy, social distancing conformance, and CDC response delay. the sensitivity of the average total cost and average total deaths to the social distancing conformance ranging between 60% and 80%. the biggest difference in performance was achieved at the lower-to-medium levels of conformance (between 65% and 72%). the curves for the average total pandemic cost exhibit a decreasing trend. as the value of approaches 70%, the curves start exhibit a converging behavior. the performance of both policies is somewhat identical for low antiviral efficacy (between 0% and 30%) the difference was between $3B to $4B in the average total cost and between 800 to 1,800 in the average number of mortalities. for both policies, there was no significant difference when the delay was between 24 and 48 hours. for the delay values exceeding 48 hours, the average number of deaths increased at a high rate. the simulation optimization methodology presented in this paper is one of the first attempts to offer dynamic predictive decision support for pandemic mitigation. the tool is intended to assist public health decision makers in implementing what-if analysis for assessment of mitigation options and development of policy guidelines. vaccine and antiviral risk groups considered in the testbed can be adjusted. the form of social distancing implemented in the testbed can also be modified as a variety of schemes can be found in the literature."}
