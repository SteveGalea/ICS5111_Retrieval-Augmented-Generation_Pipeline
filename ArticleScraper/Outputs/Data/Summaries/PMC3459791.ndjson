{"summary": "ACE I/D polymorphism was not associated with susceptibility to ALI/ARDS for any genetic model. however, the ACE I/D polymorphism was associated with the mortality risk of ALI/ARDS in Asian subjects. ACE is located on chromosome 17q23 and contains an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of a 287-bpAlu repeat sequence in intron 16 [6,7] the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) gene (ACE) is located on chromosome 17q23. it contains an insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism of a 287-bpAlu repeat sequence in in the ACE I/D polymorphism and ALI/ARDS risk were not included in this meta-analysis. ALI/ARDS was defined as a lung disease with acute onset, non-cardiac diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates and a PaO2/FiO2 300 for ALI and a PaO2/FiO2 200 for ARDS. a meta-analysis was performed using review manager version 5.0 for Windows. we included healthy subjects and patients without ALI/ARDS as separate controls. the pooled odds ratios (OR) were calculated using DerSimonian-Laird random-effects models. ACE gene was defined as a lung disease with acute onset, non-cardiac diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. ALI/ARDS was defined as a lung disease with acute onset, non-cardiac diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. ALI/ARDS was defined as a lung disease with acute onset, non-cardiac diffuse bilateral pulmonary infiltrates. studies included in meta-analysis were not restricted by language. data extraction The reference lists of reviews and retrieved articles were verified independently by two investigators (A.M. and T.K.) values of 25% are considered low, 50% moderate, and 75% high. we applied the conservative random effects model for all comparisons. the underlying effect may differ across studies and among heterogeneous populations.

ACE I/D polymorphism and mortality of ALI/ARDS was not associated with ALI/ARDS risk. there was no evidence of between-study heterogeneity. the pooled OR from the two studies did indicate a significant association for all genetic models. the pooled OR remained significant after Bonferroni\u2019s correction (corrected Pallele 0.0001, corrected Pdominant = 0.018, corrected Precessive = 0.036) ALI/ARDS Healthy controls Controls Marshall 2002 Caucasian 96 1906 262 50.3 (17\u201391) N.A. 53.6 61 (63.5) N.A. 162 (64.1) ARDS Healthy british men \u201cICU control\u201d; admitted to ICU for non-ARDS respiratory failure with mechanical ventilation (n=88) ACE I/D polymorphism and susceptibility to ALI/ARDS ALI/ARDS patients versus healthy control subjects. the pooled OR derived from the five studies did not indicate significant association for any genotype model. there was no significant publication bias using either the Egger test or the rank correlation test. the pooled OR indicated no significant association. in the two studies with Asian subjects, there was no significant heterogeneity among the ORs. the pooled OR derived from the six studies did not indicate significant association for any genotype model. pooled OR derived from the three studies [15,20,21] indicated no significant association for any genotype model. in the three studies with Asian subjects [16,17,19], 219 ALI/ARDS patients and 879 patients without ALI/ARDS. there was no evidence of between-study heterogeneity. pooled OR from the two studies did indicate a significant association for all genetic models (Pallele 0.0001, Pdominant = 0.003, and Precessive = 0.002) the pooled OR remained significant after Bonferroni\u2019s correction. in the three studies with Caucasian subjects [15,18,21], 300 patients and 2470 healthy controls, there was significant heterogeneity among the ORs. the pooled OR indicated no significant association (Additional file 2: Figure S1, Additional file 3: Figure S2, Additional file 4: Figure S3). there was no significant publication bias using either the Egger test or the rank correlation test. we then conducted an additional analysis to limit the ethnic heterogeneity. in the three studies with Caucasian subjects [15,20,21] we found significant heterogeneity among the ORs. there was no evidence of between-study heterogeneity. there was no significant publication bias using either the Egger test or the rank correlation test. the pooled OR from the two studies [18,21] did not show a significant association for any genetic model (Figures 1,2,3). the pooled OR from the two studies [16,17] did indicate a significant association for all genetic models. ACE is found in varying amounts on the surface of lung epithelial and endothelial cells. angiotensin II induces apoptosis of lung epithelial and endothelial cells. there is considerable interest in its potential involvement in ALI/ARDS. a recent meta-analysis [8] suggested a positive association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and ARDS susceptibility among Caucasians. ACE inhibitors have been reported to attenuate ALI induced by bleomycin, acid, and endotoxin in animal models. patients at risk of mortality from ALI/ARDS may be good candidates for treatment with ACE inhibitors. ACE inhibitors may influence treatment outcome through differences in drug metabolism and activity. at least 4000 samples are required to obtain sufficient statistical power. ACE I/D polymorphism genotype may be a predictor of ALI/ARDS mortality in Asian populations. authors declare that they have no competing interests. Supplementary Material Additional file 1 Table S1.
