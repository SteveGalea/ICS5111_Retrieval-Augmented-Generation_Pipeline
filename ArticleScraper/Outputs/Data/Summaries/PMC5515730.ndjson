{"summary": "supplementary information The online version of this article (doi:10.1038/nsmb.3293) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users. cryo-EM analysis of the HCoV-NL63 S trimer. the matched fragment ions define a large part of the peptide sequence. they also provide detailed information about the glycan composition. HCoV-NL63 (blue) and MHV (tan) fusion subunits. HCoV-NL63 S atomic model colored by protomer. domain 0 is shown in surface representation colored according to its electrostatic surface potential for one protomer. positively charged patch on its surface could putatively mediate binding to heparan sulfate. chymotrypsin is attached to asn 699 of the HCoV-NL63 S glycoprotein digested with chymotrypsin. the relative intensity normalized to the most intense ion is plotted against mass-to-charge ratio. \"M\" denotes the molecular ion. HCoV-NL63 binds heparan sulfate to HCoV NL63 S. the positively charged patch could putatively mediate binding to heparan sulfate."}
