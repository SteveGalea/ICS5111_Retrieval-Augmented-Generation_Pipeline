{"summary": "pathogenic bacterial, fungal and viral cells are ubiquitous in nature and pose a considerable risk to human and animal health. the monitoring of these microorganisms is of paramount importance for the prevention of nosocomial infections, the maintenance of general public health and for ensuring compliance with legislative and quality standards. listeria monocytogenes Human pathogen; causative agent of listeriosis Mycobacterium tuberculosis Human pathogen; causative agent of bacterial meningitis Salmonella typhimurium Human pathogen; causative agent of bacterial meningitis Staphylococcus aureus Human pathogen; causative agent of hospital-acquired infection; causative agent of the black plague Fungal pathogens Candida albicans Human pathogen a comprehensive summary of the principles, problems and potential of using immunosensor-based analytical platforms for pathogen detection. it describes the development of electrochemical, potentiometric, piezoelectric and optical platforms for the monitoring of foodborne bacterial pathogens by incorporating monoclonal, polyclonal or recombinant antibodies in a variety of different assay formats. Figures obtained for annual estimated cases and infectious doses (*) are obtained from reference [3]. a major disadvantage of this approach is the lengthy times required to obtain visible colonies that can be identified. an alternative method for pathogen detection involves the amplification and subsequent analysis of pathogen-specific nucleic acid by polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. the presence of bacterial RNAs (mRNA and tmRNA) in food samples can be determined through the use of nucleic-acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA) polyclonal, monoclonal and recombinant antibodies have often been selected for a wide variety of applications. their production involves the exploitation of the immune system of murine, leporine, ovine or avian hosts. the immune response generated by the host after a series of immunisations can be determined by screening serial serum dilutions for recognition of the antigen. a more in-depth discussion of antibody glycosylation is provided in reference [30] monoclonal antibodies are generated through the use of hybridoma technology [31,32] and murine hosts are commonly selected for immunisation. resulting hybrid cells secrete full-length antibodies directed towards a single epitope. Suitable candidates are then \u2018cloned out\u2019 to ensure that a single cell is present and the antibody generated can be used for assay development. immuno libraries are constructed from RNA isolated from spleenocytes or the bone marrow of a host (avian, murine, leporine etc.) immunised with an antigen that generates the required immune response. the RNA acts as a source of complementary DNA (cDNA) which serves as a template for the amplification of variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) gene sequences which can be fused through an overlapping-extension splic binders are retained and subjected to additional screening to increase their specificity for the target. the production of soluble antibody fragments can be facilitated by infecting phage pools into non-suppressor E. coli strains, such as Top-10F' or HB2151, and inducing with isopropyl--D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) monoclonal antibodies are generated through the use of hybridoma technology [31,32] and murine hosts are commonly selected for immunisation. the resulting hybrid cells secrete full-length antibodies that are directed towards a single epitope. Suitable candidates are then \u2018cloned out\u2019 to ensure that a single cell is present and the antibody generated can be used for assay development. the RNA acts as a source of complementary DNA (cDNA) which serves as a template for the amplification of variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) gene sequences. the construct can be fused through an overlapping-extension splicing PCR reaction and subsequently cloned into a suitable phage or phagemid vector. soluble antibody fragments can be facilitated by infecting phage pools into non-suppressor E. coli strains. these hosts recognise the amber codon engineered between the scFv and gIII gene [39], producing scFv or Fab fragments independent of the phage coat proteins. recombinant antibodies are as yet not fully exploited in this field. the selection of a highly-specific epitope on the pathogen is a key consideration. it is therefore recommended that a constitutively-expressed antigen, which is species-specific, is targeted. the antibody should bind with its cognate target with sufficient strength to permit interrogation (high-affinity) ELISA and microarray-based pathogen Detection ELISA-based analysis can be directly applied for the detection of foodborne pathogens. ELISA-based assays have also been described for the detection of L. monocytogenes [50,51] and Salmonella enterica spp. [52] Array formats typically consist of a panel of pathogen-specific antibodies spotted onto individual positions on a microarray slide by dedicated robotic handling (printing) a biotinylated antibody for E. coli O157:H7 was printed on a streptavidin-coated microarray slide. 96-well polystyrene plate was selected for the simultaneous detection of E. coli (1 106 cells/mL) and Salmonella typhimurium (1 107 cells/mL) in buffer and ground beef extract. antibody-based microarray platforms have been selected for the sensitive and parallel detection of structurally diverse pathogens. these include bacterial strains that pose a potential bio-terrorism risk. the sensitivities of these assays are dependent on the properties of the transducer and the quality of the antibody. a full-length antibody is captured on protein A immobilised on a carboxymethylated dextran-coated sensor surface. this interaction produces a specific physicochemical change, such as a change in mass, temperature or electrical potential. this is then converted (via a transducer) to a signal which the user can interpret. anti-Campylobacter antibodies were embedded in a bilayer lipid membrane. the resultant current was detected amperometrically via a stainless steel electrode. this value was correlated with a theoretical value of one bacterial cell per sample. sensitivity was observed when polyclonal goat antibodies were used for capturing cells in an indirect sandwich assay format. the direct immobilisation of L. monocytogenes cells provided a low response. the limit of detection for InB was found to be 4.1 pg/mL [68] when captured on avidin-coated planar carbon electrodes modified with polyaniline, a conductive polymer. a quartz crystal microbalance system using impedance could detect S. typhimurium in chicken meat. urease enzymatic activity was monitored by the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia. the authors were able to detect approximately 7.1 102 cells/mL and 2.5 104 cells/mL of heat-killed and live cells of E. coli. the assay was rapid (6 minutes) and could be generated in a disposable format. a biotinylated polyclonal antibody was captured on streptavidin-coated magnetite nanoparticles. a small amount of background was observed when S. epidermis cells were assayed in parallel. anti-Campylobacter antibodies were embedded in a bilayer lipid membrane. the resultant current was detected amperometrically via a stainless steel electrode. this value was correlated with a theoretical value of one bacterial cell per sample. a direct sandwich assay format, consisting of a leporine polyclonal capture antibody and an AP-labelled detection antibody, could detect 9 102 cells/mL. the direct immobilisation of L. monocytogenes cells on the SPCE provided a low response. the limit of detection for InB was found to be 4.1 pg/mL. a quartz crystal microbalance system using impedance could detect S. typhimurium in chicken meat. the implementation of magnetic beads resulted in a significant improvement in assay sensitivity. urease enzymatic activity was monitored by the hydrolysis of urea to carbon dioxide and ammonia. the authors were able to detect approximately 7.1 102 cells/mL and 2.5 104 cells/mL of heat-killed and live cells of E. coli. a biotinylated polyclonal antibody was captured on streptavidin-coated magnetite nanoparticles. these were then bound on a conductimetric electrode through the use of glutaraldehyde coupling. a small amount of background was observed when S. epidermis cells were assayed in parallel. l-N\u2032-(3\u2032dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) and N-hydroxysuccinimide coupling allowed the capture of a monoclonal antibody for S. paratyphi A. the resulting assay was rapid, permitting analysis in ten minutes (inclusive of a regeneration step for re-analysis) magnetic biosensors, in contrast, implement magnetic beads coated with a suitable ligand that can be detected within a magnetic field. a sample selected for analysis does not contain any contaminating materials with magnetic properties, background signals (non-specific) are minimised. electrochemical, piezoelectric and magnetic immunosensors can all be applied to foodborne pathogen detection. Optical platforms also offer a powerful and \u2018label-free\u2019 methodology that permits \u2018real-time\u2019 pathogen detection. wei et al. [88] used the SPREETATM SPR system (Texas Instruments) for the detection of Campylobacter jejuni. biotinylated leporine polyclonal antibodies were immobilised directly on the sensor surface and the assay had a sensitivity of 1 103 CFU/mL. a biotinylated capture antibody is immobilised on an avidin-coated fibre-optic waveguide. a percentage of the emitted fluorescence is detected by an optical probe. the assay had a sensitivity of 70 cells/mL. the RAPTOR biosensor collects emitted light at wavelengths of over 650 nm [96]. pathogens can also be recovered and propagated by incubating waveguides containing bound bacterial cells in selective media post-analysis. a more detailed discussion of Biacore-based analytical approaches will now be provided. sandwich assay formats are routinely selected for increasing sensitivity in ELISA-based analytical platforms. the initial experimental format implemented a capture assay format (5 109 CFU/mL) no apparent increase in sensitivity was observed when protein A was used to immobilise the mAb. inability of two anti-L. monocytogenes polyclonal antibodies to enhance signal in an assay format where cells were originally captured by a mouse monoclonal antibody [6] there are also concerns with using this sandwich format due to the large size of the bacterial cells which exceed the penetration depth of an evanescent wave. a centrifugation step was used as an alternative to filtration for the separation of free polyclonal antibody. a goat anti-rabbit polyclonal antibody immobilised on a CM5 surface. the efficacy of this assay format was illustrated by the low limit of detection (1 105 cells/mL), and by the short assay time required to obtain data (30 minutes;excluding preparation of the sensor surface) racis Optical Sandwich Biotinylated rabbit anti-B. anthracis polyclonal CY5 [D] 3.2 105 spores/mg powder [108] Piezoelectric Capture Rabbit polyclonal anti-B. anthracis [C] 333 spores/mL [109] B. globigii Optical Sandwich Goat anti-B. globigii [C]; rabbit anti-B. glob the capture of a rabbit polyclonal antibody on the sensor surface did not permit the detection of free SEB. a rapid (less than 10 minutes) fibre-optic SPR-based assay was also developed. whole S. aureus cells in direct and sandwich assay formats (1 105 CFU/mL) alkane monothiol and dithiol dendritic tether-based SAMs used for the capture of polyclonal antibodies via EDC/NHS coupling. SIA assays, described earlier for bacterial strains, may circumvent this problem. the resultant assay took approximately 45 minutes with a detection level of 3.1 105 urediniospores/mL. additional immunosensor formats have also been used for the detection of human fungal pathogens. a phage display format incorporated monomeric and dimeric scFv antibodies into a Biacore-based inhibition assay. the assay allowed the detection of between 390 and 12,000 ppb and 190 and 24,000 ppb of AFB1 with monomeric and dimeric scFvs. phycotoxins are structurally diverse and non-proteinaceous compounds. they pose a considerable risk to human health by causing respiratory, neurological or gastrointestinal problems. primary route of infection is through the ingestion of contaminated shellfish meat or drinking water. a selection of structures is shown in Figure 8. Paralytic shellfish poisoning (PSP) is classified according to associated symptoms of infection. toxins are water soluble, thermostable tetrahydropurine molecules. most commonly encountered toxins are gonyatoxin (GTX) and saxitoxin (STX) the latter is especially toxic, and over 20 structural analogues with differing degrees of toxicity have been reported in nature. hepatoxins microcystin (MC) and nodularin during red-tide events have been identified as causative agents. consumption of contaminated water supplies is the primary route of infection. a small number of immunosensor-based formats have been developed. ystin-LR (MC) Optical Direct Monoclonal anti-MC-LR-Cy5 [P] 0.03 g/L [156] Capacitance Capture Monoclonal anti-MC-LR-Cy5 [C] 7 pg/L [157] Optical Direct Mouse monoclonal anti-OA-HRP [P] 0.1 g/L [159] Piezoelectric Capture Monoclonal anti-OA [C] biosensors for marine toxins should permit the detection of a toxin in a complex matrix, such as shellfish meat. it remains to be seen whether they will be incorporated into legislation or routine monitoring programmes in the near future. assays use amperometric [169-171], piezoelectric [172] and optical [173] -based platforms. a wide range of applications have been highlighted involving the use of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. however, several of the aforementioned assays have also focused on a particular antigen. detection of bacterial and fungal cells whose sizes are typically between 1 \u2013 5 micrometers and in excess of 40 micrometers. bacterial cells whose diameters exceed this area may compromise detection. in biacore-based analytical systems, the depth at which a SPR-produced evanescent wave can penetrate when TIR occurs is 0.3 m. monoclonal antibody incubate overnight in a glutaraldehyde-cacodylate buffer. incubate overnight in a glutaraldehyde-cacodylate buffer and fix in the presence of osmium tetroxide. ELISA and Biacore-based assays differ from each other. strains of E. coli O157:H7 were able to differentiate from unrelated strains. electronic nose-based sensor chamber incorporated four metal-oxide gas sensors for the detection of volatile products of E. coli growth. the ability of plants sensors (phytosensors) to detect environmental conditions is still in its infancy in terms of sensor technology. a phytosensor capable of detecting plant pathogens at the molecular level was described by Mazarei and co-workers. permitting on-site analysis to be performed in a rapid, reliable and sensitive manner."}
