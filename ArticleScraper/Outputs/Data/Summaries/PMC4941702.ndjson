{"summary": "hajj is the largest annual recurring religious mass gathering in the world occurring in mecca, Saudi Arabia. more than 25 million people from at least 180 countries participate simultaneously in this MG. such a MG can raise the risks of public health issues such as respiratory infections, meningococcal outbreaks, and foodborne diseases. a total of 3200 people from the two provinces of fars and Kohgiluyeh va Buyer Ahmad, southern Iran, participated in the 2009 Hajj. the duration of the Hajj is 1 week but MG lasts for about 30 days. nasopharyngeal and pharyngeal swabs are reportedly more suitable for respiratory virus isolation. the dacron swabs on a flexible plastic shaft were collected in viral transport medium (VTM) and stored at 4\u00b0C before being quickly transported to the Professor Alborzi Clinical Microbiology Research Center at Namazi Hospital, Shiraz. the amplification process was performed using TaqMan 1Step RTPCR Master Mix Reagents in a 7500 RealTime PCR System instrument. spss 17.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) was used to test the correlations of the age, sex and each presenting symptom of the subjects with their viral loads. dacron swabs were collected in viral transport medium (VTM) and stored at 4\u00b0C. samples were transported to the professor alborzi clinical microbiology research center. RNA extraction For all samples, nucleic acid was extracted from 200l volume of VTM using a commercially available viral RNA isolation kit. the amplification process was performed using TaqMan 1Step RTPCR Master Mix Reagents (Roche, Branchburg, NJ, USA) in a 7500 RealTime PCR System instrument (Applied Biosystems, USA) as follows: 48\u00b0C for 30 minute (reverse transcription) and 95\u00b0C for 10 minute (DNA polymerase activation), followed by 45 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 10 second (denaturation) and 60\u00b0C for 60 second (annealing and extension) no./total no. (%) Fever 34/305 (111) Cough 147/305 (482) Sore throat 141/305 (462) Nasal symptoms 185/305 (6065) Myalgia 97/305 (318) Headache 126/305 (413) Diarrhea 5/305 (16) Vomiting 5/305 (16) Vaccinated with influenza vaccine during 2009\u20132010 season \u2013 no./total no. (%) 298/305 (97 no correlation was observed between viral load and age or sex. a significant correlation was found between viral load and fever (P = 0001). there was a low point prevalence of A(H1N1)pdm09 shown. the reasons could be the virulence of the A(H1N1)pdm09 not being higher than that of seasonal one. it is noteworthy that 298 (977%) pilgrims had been vaccinated against the 2009\u20132010 seasonal flu viruses before leaving Iran for Saudi Arabia. the first cases of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in Iran had been reported in June 2009. the results do not indicate any severe complication of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection during the Hajj. susceptible pilgrims may be at risk of infection during this 1month stay in Saudi Arabia. the arrival of pilgrims from the hajj to their home countries did not cause a new wave of A(H1N1)pdm09 infection in the community. this finding can help avoid the overestimation of the potential threat of infection and the improper mobilization of social and healthcare services.
