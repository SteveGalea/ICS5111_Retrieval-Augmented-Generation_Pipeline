{"summary": "contact tracing is the identification of individuals who have come into contact with an infectious case. the goals of contact tracing arise to reduce the likelihood of transmission. contact tracing has been used in the control of many diseases, including tuberculosis. individuals face costs of contact disclosure. real costs include time spent in interviews and in the effort spent recalling contacts. ring vaccination requires contact tracing. a model of a small group may describe small groups within a model featuring more transmission between members of the same group, but allowing between-group transmission for any two individuals in the population [64, 65] we will use this model to derive the expected reduction in infection risk for an individual and expected costs. in the absence of contact investigation, we have 43 = 64 possible states for the small group. for the case N = 3, q I,S,S is the probability that person 1 is infectious, and persons 2 and 3 are susceptible. d t q X 1, X 2, X 3 = ( 1 X 1 = I 1 X 1 = E ) q E, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = I 1 X 2 = E ) q X 1, X 2, E + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, I + ( X 1, X 2, X 3 ) q S, X 2, X we introduce the contact investigation process model that would occur in the absence of anyone being infected. in the absence of infection, individuals become newly known when and only when they are disclosed by other known individuals. for disease transmission, we assume that disease may be transmitted between any two people. we model the rate at which persons unknown to the investigation become newly known as follows. Suppose that person i is known to the investigation, but person j is not. then we assume that the waiting time for person j to become known is exponentially distributed with rate as a result. d t q S \u2032, S \u2032, S = q S \u2032, S \u2032, S 21 q S \u2032, S \u2032, S ( 13 + 23 ). newly diagnosed individuals are the only way that a contact investigation can become initiated. the first diagnosed individual inaugurates the first contact investigation. the mean time to diagnosis can be shorter for an infective if she or he has contacts that disclose her or him. when an exposed individual is investigated, he or she may take protective measures to reduce the chance of infection. also, when an exposed individual is contacted, he or she may receive postexposure protective measures. an individual who is never infected and never disclosed will never become known to an investigation. we assume no further attrition; all named contacts will eventually be identified. the rate at which person 1 will be visited depends on which contacts have been investigated and whether the contacts choose to disclose. the total rate at which person 1 will be visited is then 1 = 211X2S\u2032,E\u2032,R,V + 311X3S\u2032,E\u2032,R,V. q A \u2032 + q R \u2032 + q V \u2032 + q C, 1 \u2032 + q C, 2 \u2032 + q C, 3 \u2032, (6) where q B\u2032 are terms for disease progression before a person is ever contacted in an investigation. q R\u2032 are terms for removal by diagnosis unrelated to contact investigation, q I\u2032 are terms for infection, q V\u2032 are terms for vaccination, and q C,i\u2032 (i = 1,2, q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = E \u2032 1 X 2 = S \u2032 ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( X 1, X 2, X 3 ) ( 1 X q V \u2032 = ( 1 X 1 = V 1 X 1 = S \u2032 ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = V 1 X 3 = S \u2032 ) q X 1, X 2, S \u2032 + ( 1 X 1 = V 1 X 1 = E \u2032 ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 2 = V 1 X 2 = E \u2032 ) q q X 1, E, X 3 + ( 1 X 2 = R 1 X 2 = I ) q X 1, X 2, S + ( 1 X 3 = E \u2032 1 X 3 = E ) q X 1, X 2, E + ( 1 X 3 = E \u2032 1 X 3 = E ) q X 1, X 2, E + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, the system undergoes stochastic transitions until it reaches an absorbing state. in the second step, person 1 infects person 2 (lower left circle) in this example, person 3 never becomes infected. q R,X2S,S\u2032,X3S,S\u2032(t) = q R,S\u2032(t) + q R,S\u2032(t) + q R,S\u2032(t) + q R,S\u2032,S\u2032(t) + q R,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032(t) + q R,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032,S\u2032 we assume that this cost is incurred whenever person i is investigated. denote this overall cost by C o; we will assume that this is zero in almost all cases below unless specifically indicated otherwise. the payoff for the entire group is simply P = i P i. other cost models are possible; for example, it is possible that an individual could incur a cost if someone else discloses him or her. the overall basic reproduction number, describing the ability of a disease to invade the population as a whole, is given by K. a model of a small group may describe small groups within a model featuring more transmission between members of the same group, but allowing between-group transmission for any two individuals in the population [64, 65] we will use this model to derive the expected reduction in infection risk for an individual and expected costs. our analysis concerns transmission events following the introduction of a single case in a small group (of size 3) similar models have been analyzed by many other authors. the force of infection for each susceptible individualsis given by times the prevalence in the rest of the population. for all states X 1, X 2, X 3 = ( 1 X 1 = I 1 X 1 = E ) q X 1, X 2, E + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 2 = I ) q X 1, X 2, I + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 2 = I ). we introduce the contact investigation process model that would occur in the absence of anyone being infected. all individuals are susceptible, but we assume that individuals are either unknown to the investigation (S) or known (S\u2032). once an individual is known to the investigation, he or she remains known throughout the investigation. we model the rate at which persons unknown to the investigation become newly known as follows. Suppose that person i is known to the investigation, but person j is not. then we assume that the waiting time for person j to become known is exponentially distributed with rate as a result, independent of whether person i is willing to disclose any other individuals. d t q S \u2032, S \u2032, S = q S \u2032, S 12 + q S, S \u2032, S 21 q S \u2032, S \u2032, S (13 + 23 ). newly diagnosed individuals are the only way that a contact investigation can become initiated. the first diagnosed individual inaugurates the first contact investigation. if an individual is investigated, he or she is immediately diagnosed. the mean time to diagnosis can be shorter for an infective. if an exposed individual is investigated, he or she may take protective measures to reduce the chance of infection. contact investigations help control disease by (1) preventing transmission from infections that occur in contacted individuals prior to symptoms due to rapid diagnosis and voluntary isolation. (2) permitting the use of postexposure protective measures for exposed persons, and (3) allowing uninfected susceptible individuals to take protective measures. an individual who is never infected will never become known to an investigation. an individual in state S (susceptible, never investigated) may move to state S\u2032 (susceptible, investigated); the rate at which this occurs depends on which contacts have been investigated. if person 2 is in state S\u2032, E\u2032, R, or V, then person 2 has had an opportunity to disclose person 1 (as well as person 3) to the investigators. q X 1, X 2, X 3 = q B \u2032 + q A \u2032 + q R \u2032 + q C, 1 \u2032 + q C, 2 \u2032 + q C, 3 \u2032, (6) where q B\u2032 are terms for disease progression before a person is ever contacted in an investigation. q I\u2032 are terms for removal by diagnosis unrelated to contact investigation, q V\u2032 are terms for vaccination, and q C,i\u2032 (i q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = E \u2032 1 X 2 = S \u2032 ) q V \u2032 = ( 1 X 1 = V 1 X 1 = S \u2032 ) q S \u2032, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = V 1 X 3 = S \u2032 ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 1 = V 1 X 3 = E \u2032 ) q X 1, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 1 = V 1 X 2 = E \u2032 ) q q E, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 1 = R 1 X 1 = I ) q I, X 2, X 3 + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, E + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = E ) q X 1, X 2, E + ( 1 X 3 = R 1 X 3 = I ) q X 1, X 2, E + ( the equations imply that the transitions between the states form a directed acyclic graph; no state can ever be visited more than once. the system undergoes stochastic transitions until it reaches an absorbing state. in this example, person 1 is exposed and then becomes infectious. q R, X 2 S, S \u2032, X 3 S, S \u2032 () + 2 ( q R, X 2 S, S \u2032, X 3 S, S \u2032 () + 2 ( q R, R, X 3 S, S \u2032) + 3 ( q R, R, R, q R, R, ), (13) where q R,X2S,S\u2032,X3S,S\u2032(t) = disclosure is C ij, which is the cost incurred by person i upon disclosing person j. we assume that this cost is incurred whenever person i is investigated. if a person is investigated, we compute the disclosure costs for each final state. the payoff for the entire group is simply P = i P i. other cost models are possible; for example, it is possible that an individual could incur a cost if someone else discloses him or her. the overall basic reproduction number, describing the ability of a disease to invade the population as a whole, is given by K, as shown by [64]. the system of ordinary differential equations given by (6) is a linear system with constant coefficients. beginning with the initial condition q X1,X2,X3 = 0 for all combinations of X 1, X 2, and X 3 other than q E,S,S,S = 1, the total probability in each final state of the system as t can be computed as the sum of the probability of arriving at each final state. states containing S\u2032 are absorbing states only when = 0. The transition rates from each state of the system constitute the generator P of the system. we let p lk be the transition rate to state l from state k; p kk = 0 for all k. for each strategy choice of all three individuals, we determined the probability that person 3 (Charlie) was infected. for each row, Alice is assumed to disclose either Bob or Charlie or both, as indicated in the first two columns. for each row, Alice is assumed to disclose either Bob or Charlie or both, as given in the next two columns. analytic expressions for the quantities K 1, K 2, K 3 and K 4 are given in the text. analytic expressions for the quantities K 1, K 2, K 3 and K 4 are given in the text. c 0 = 4 ( + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 c 2 = 2 ( 2 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + ), (20) and c 3 =. also, c 2 = 2 ( 2 + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + ), (20) and c 3 =. d 0 = 2 ( d 0 + d 1 + d 1 + d 2 2 ), (23) with d we first numerically examine a collection of scenarios to determine the reduction in transmission due to contact investigation. we will examine low, moderate, and large within-group transmission, as measured by 1, which is the expected number of secondary cases. we will look at large and small values of the latency period relative to the infectious period. no protective effect against infection was assumed for susceptible individuals who were interviewed by contact investigators. a long latent period, fast investigations, and prompt postexposure prophylaxis favor disease control. we chose a scenario of rapid tracing and prophylaxis, together with a long latent period. we computed 1 for each of the 64 possible choice combinations. the rows indicate the persons disclosed by Alice and Charlie. a total of 16 possible combinations of these choices are available. the difference is the amount by which Charlie reduces his or her probability of disease by disclosing Alice compared to no one. the only person Charlie should disclose to obtain benefit is Alice. effective prevention among people who have been investigated reduces incentives to disclose others. if there is no transmission ( = 0) or no investigation ( = 0), Charlie does not benefit from disclosure; no benefit from disclosure is seen when = 0 and = 0, because the index case would never proceed to disease and diagnosis in these cases. numerical analysis shows that the best strategy for each person is to disclose all contacts. Bob and Charlie each have an expected payoff of approximately 0.124 (arbitrary units) under these assumptions. if Bob switches to one of his other strategies, the expected payoff is lower. no contact tracing will occur, and preventable infections will happen. if the strategy of Alice is to disclose Bob, then the best strategy for Bob is to disclose Charlie and not Alice. disclosure before diagnosis In the preceding section, individuals are assumed to use the same strategy for disclosure all the time, whether or not the person was identified before he or she became a case. in the latter case, the individual has no chance to prevent her or himself from becoming diseased. we denote by R cases known prior to symptoms (individuals in state E\u2032 who become diseased) the Kolmogorov equations will be numerically integrated using the lsoda function in the R package deSolve, v. 1.10. if no one discloses after diagnosis ( 12\u2032 = 21\u2032 = 13\u2032 = 31\u2032 = 23\u2032 = 32\u2032 = 0), then no investigations ever result and the values of ij do not matter. at a cost of 103, the optimal strategy is for Bob to disclose no one. the solution to the equations confirms the optimal strategy for Charlie. this result disappears when the cost of disclosure is raised. the percent decline in transmission within the group is shown for low, medium, and high within-group transmission (0 = 0.1, 1, and 1.9) no protective effect against infection was assumed for susceptible individuals who were interviewed by contact investigators ( = 1). we computed 1 for each of the 64 possible choices. we chose a scenario of rapid tracing and prophylaxis. we chose a scenario of rapid tracing and prophylaxis. a total of 16 possible combinations of these choices are available. the difference is the amount by which Charlie reduces his or her probability of disease by disclosing Alice compared to no one. the only person Charlie should disclose to obtain benefit is Alice. effective prevention among people who have been investigated reduces incentives to disclose others, simply because there is nothing else for any given individual to gain once he or she has been investigated. if there is no transmission ( = 0) or no investigation ( = 0), Charlie does not benefit from disclosure. numerical analysis shows that the best strategy for each person is to disclose all contacts. Bob and Charlie each have an expected payoff of approximately 0.124 (arbitrary units) under these assumptions. if Bob switches to one of his other strategies, the expected payoff is lower. the analysis is the same for Charlie. no contact tracing will occur, and preventable infections will happen. if the strategy of Alice is to disclose Bob, then the best strategy for Bob is to disclose Bob. the best strategy for each individual is to disclose all other individuals. the best strategy for each individual is to disclose all other individuals. if Bob switches to one of his other strategies, the expected payoff is lower. in this case, the Nash equilibrium is for each player to disclose no contacts, despite the fact that this yields the largest possible transmission of disease. this occurs because the index case Alice, already infected, can never reduce her probability of infection by disclosing and so has no incentive to bear the cost of disclosure. the personal cost is minimized by never disclosing. if the strategy of Alice is to disclose Bob, then the best strategy for Bob is to disclose Charlie and not Alice. if Bob is using the strategy of disclosing Charlie, then Charlie could infer that whenever he has been investigated before infection, it was the result of Bob's disclosure. ij = ij\u2032 for all i, j, this model reduces to the model previously analyzed. the Kolmogorov equations will be numerically integrated using the lsoda function in the R package deSolve, v. 1.10. we examined the case 12\u2032 = 1 and = 21\u2032 = 13\u2032 = 31\u2032 = 23\u2032 = 32\u2032 = 0, where the index case Alice will initiate the investigation by disclosing Bob if diagnosed. we found that for a tiny cost of 104, Bob should disclose Charlie and Charlie should disclose no one. this result disappears when the cost of disclosure is raised. the model assumes that individuals may benefit by disclosing other individuals in their network of contacts. the sole such benefit is a reduction in infection risk resulting from earlier diagnosis of other individuals in the group. we assumed a specific simple form where individuals could be protected after exposure by vaccination. we examined an extended version of the model in which individuals could make a different choice depending on whether they were identified in time to prevent illness. this model found that the direct benefits of prevention could outweigh small disclosure costs, favoring disclosure. limitations of modeling human behavior as governed by classical economic models of rational optimization have long been noted [74] in disease control settings or emergency responses more generally, fear [75] as well as altruism [73, 76, 77] have been reported. findings highlight the central importance of reducing costs of contact investigation for all participants."}
