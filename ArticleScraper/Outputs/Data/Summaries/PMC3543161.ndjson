{"summary": "national surveys have shown TB has been hyper endemic in NHAR for decades. no active surveys had been undertaken since the initiation of the DOTS control program across all of NHAR. prevalence had decreased to 536/100,000 in 1990 reflecting an average annual decrease in prevalence of 4.5%. prevalence continued to decrease slowly during the 1990s (3.2% per annum) to 367/100,000 in 2000. the end of 2004 93% of the county and township levels in NHAR were covered by the program, comparable to levels in other parts of the PRC [8]. despite the long-standing TB endemicity, there is very limited published literature for NHAR, with exception of a small number of local government documents. patients enter the DOTS program which prescribes short-course chemotherapy (SCC) followed by 4 months of H and R. this is the WHO recommended regimen for treating new cases of smear-positive pulmonary TB or smear-negative pulmonary TB. the date of onset of symptoms was defined as the first occurrence of the main complaint and symptom related to TB infection. this was further broken down by days from onset of symptoms to seeking medical treatment and number of days from seeking medical treatment to diagnosis. the case status of patients in Yongning County was coded differently to other counties in the province. patients enter the DOTS program which prescribes short-course chemotherapy (SCC) followed by 2 months of isoniazid (H), rifampicin (R), pyrazinamide (Z) plus streptomycin (S) or ethambutol (E) followed by 4 months of H and R. the program is continued at the family/community level. the number of individuals on treatment for more than 1 year was calculated as the number of new cases registered prior to 1st October 2008 who had taken more than 1 year to complete treatment. time to diagnosis was calculated as the number of days from the date of onset of symptoms to the date of diagnosis. the case status of patients in Yongning County was coded differently to other counties in the province. cidence (95% CI) Longde (220) 92.6 144.2 125.5 111.4 117.9 (102.1-133.7) Yinchuan (271) 65.9 79.9 103.5 93.5 94.3 84.4 (72.8-96.0) Zhongning (77) 86.6 95.8 82.0 80.2 83.0 (62.3-103.6) Haiyuan (54) 63.2 116.0 76.2 81.4 82.4 (68.3-96.5) total Ningxia 62.0 (2566) 80.5 (3405) 75.0 (3093) 75.5 (3140) 70.1 (66.9-73.2) distribution of disease and infection indicators by county: (A)Shows the average TB incidence (per 100,000 population); (B) Shows the proportion of advanced stage cases in 2009; (C) Shows the average percentage of cases continuing treatment > 1 year. the lowest incidence occurred in the youngest age groups between 0 and 19 years of age with a small peak in young adults (20\u201325 years of age) in general, the incidence was higher in males than in females. most TB patients were found to be new cases, accounting for 94% of the entire data set. longde and tongxin counties reported the lowest number of advanced stage cases throughout the 5-year period (an average of 0.24% and 0.19%, respectively) treatment of TB We investigated the length of time of treatment in all new registered cases.

N > 6 months indicates the number of individuals who took longer than 6 months to seek treatment/be diagnosed. this was due mainly to the collapse of the public health system. the overall distribution of high incidence counties appears to be random and could be due to different TB transmission factors occurring in these areas. for example, longde county in south NHAR had the highest proportion of individuals waiting over six months from the onset of symptoms to seeking medical advice (15.8%), which combined with the highest population density in NHAR. the low TB incidence evident in the very young (0\u20139 years of age) in NHAR reflects the difficulty of establishing a definitive diagnosis in this age group. the higher incidence observed in some adult age categories could also reflect the different socio-economic status of these groups. more than 25% of all cases wait over three months to seek medical attention. inadequate TB awareness in the community coupled with poor knowledge may increase community exposure and fuel TB transmission. TB is a major public health concern in NHAR. the reported incidence of TB here is most likely grossly underestimated."}
