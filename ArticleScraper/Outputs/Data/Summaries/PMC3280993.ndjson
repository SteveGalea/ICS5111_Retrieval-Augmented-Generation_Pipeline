{"summary": "H5N1 viruses have caused 520 laboratory-confirmed infections in 15 countries. 307 of which were fatal, resulting in a fatality rate of approximately 60% since 2003. clinical observations indicated acute lung injury and multiple organ dysfunction were the direct causes of death in H5N1-infected humans. neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in treating avian influenza. neuraminidase inhibitors are effective in treating avian influenza. pneumonias, including varicella-zoster virus infection and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), are also insufficient [7]\u2013[8]. recombinant hemagglutinin, the major surface glycoprotein of H5N1, is responsible for viral binding to host receptors and initiating immediate signalling transduction upon viral invasion. recombinant HA purified from Bacmid/HA-transfected SF9 cells. a549 cells treated with 40 g/ml HA (b) or the control (a) for 12 h (bar = 50 m) the cells treated with HA become swollen, rounded and irregular in size and shape. western blotting was performed in the A549 cells treated with the HA (40 g/ml) for the indicated time periods. representative gels from 3 replicates are shown. a transcriptional factor for many antiviral genes, resulting in the production of chemokines (e.g., IP-10) that play critical roles in the infiltration of leukocytes into the site of inflammation [29]. NF-B dimers bind to B sites within the promoter of the IP10 gene [30]. HA-stimulated a549 cells following treatment with the JAK3 inhibitor VI compared to those with HA stimulation alone. blot analysis (A) and RT-PCR (B) were performed to assess the signal pathways and the gene expression in the HA-treated A549 cells challenged with HA. dema, interstitial exudation and hyaline membrane formation. marked thickening of interalveolar septa; dense interstitial infiltration by inflammatory cells. pathological examination of lung tissues was performed at 72 h. the levels of IFN- inducible chemokines/cytokines (e.g., IP-10, MCP-1 and RANTES) released from the splenocytes of the HA-pretreated-Jak3+/+ mice were significantly increased under basal conditions (P0.05) no significant difference was detected in the expression levels of chemokines in Jak3/ mice following either PBS or HA instillation. kines/chemokines released from the splenocytes of either Jak3+/+ or Jak3/ mice pretreated with HA or PBS. both mice were intratracheally inoculated with 90 g HA or PBS. the stimulation of LPS induced an increase in levels of RANTES and MCP-1. nocytes of HA-pretreated mice were significantly higher in Jak3+/+ mice. splenocytes produced higher levels of chemokines/cytokines compared to the PBS-pretreated mice and to the Jak3/ mice with HA pretreatment. we also made a comparison of the fold increase of the induced chemokines/cytokines between both groups of Jak3+/+ and Jak3/ mice. the effects of injury on the splenocytes challenged with LPS in HA-pretreated mice. the splenocytes isolated from mice pretreated with HA or intratracheal instillation with PBS for 72 h. cultured human pulmonary epithelial A549 cells were challenged with recombinant HA at 40 g/ml. after 12 h of stimulation, the cells became swollen, rounded and irregular in size and shape. the cells treated with HA become swollen, rounded and irregular in size and shape. a549 cells exposed to HA have increased levels of phosphorylation of JAK2, JAK3, STAT1 and NF-B. but not of JAK1 and STAT5 (data not shown) in a time-dependent manner. IL-6, IL-8, MCP-1, MIP-1, MIP-1 and RANTES in the supernatant of the A549 cells treated with the indicated doses of HA for 12 h. previous studies have demonstrated that phosphorylated STAT1 dimerises and translocates into the nucleus to activate the transcription of a number of genes. a characteristic feature of HA-triggered JAK/STAT signalling. we therefore examined if targeting JAK3 could block the induction of transcriptional activation of IP-10 and IRF-1 by HA. we also observed significantly lower levels of cytokines/chemokines in the HA-stimulated A549 cells following treatment with the JAK3 inhibitor VI. a Liquidchip assay was performed on the supernatants of the HA-challenged A549 cells incubated with HA (40 g/ml) for 12 h in the absence and presence of the JAK3 inhibitor VI (760 nM) pathologic examination observed diffuse alveolar damage combined with edema, interstitial exudation and hyaline membrane formation. pathological examination of lung tissues was performed at 72 h after HA administration (bar = 50 m) the lung injury score was assessed in the lung tissues of the mice treated as above (F) the spleen tissues from the Jak3+/+ mice after 72 h of HA intratracheal instillation exhibited swelling, destruction of the local structure of germinal centres and dead lymphocytes. cytokines/chemokines released from splenocytes of either Jak3+/+ or Jak3/ mice pretreated with HA or HA for 72 h. we tested whether targeting JAK3 signals could prevent superinflammatory responses following bacteria/endotoxin attack. this was tested due to the natural course of the virus. both mice were intratracheally inoculated with 90 g HA or PBS. after 72 h of instillation, the spleen cells were isolated from both groups. the stimulation of LPS induced an increase in levels of RANTES and MCP-1 in the splenocytes of HA-pretreated mice upon LPS challenge. after LPS stimulation was LPS-dependently higher in the Jak3+/+ mice. cytokines/chemokines released from splenocytes after LPS challenge. cytokines/chemokines released from splenocytes after LPS challenge. splenocytes were treated with HA or intratracheal instillation with PBS for 72 h. the cells were subjected to a CCK-8 assay for the evaluation of the injury index. sustained JAK3-dependent cytokine signals following virus antigenic challenge predispose the animal to an increased virulence. HA-triggered signalling events are characterised by an unusual process involved in the phosphorylation of JAK3. the Janus kinases, including JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and Tyk2, are cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases that play an important role in the receptor binding-triggered signal transduction. splenocytes from HA-pretreated mice showed to significantly increase production of IFN-inducible chemokines (e.g., IP10, MCP1) without stimulation. elevation of IP-10 that emerged at the onset of SARS was followed by progressive lymphopenia with a concomitant increase of lactate dehydrogenase. this suggests a depletion of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues. the inhibition of JAK3 activation enables the negative regulation of NF-B signalling. previous studies using global immune suppressants have failed to demonstrate protection against lethal influenza virus challenge. selective inhibition of jak3-dependent cytokine signals did not affect cell cycle progression following optimal stimulation of T cell receptor plus CD28. this could explain our findings that a genetic deficiency in Jak3 protected splenic lymphocytes from the intense immune-mediated destruction. JAK3 seems to serve as a central signal molecular for the transduction of a \u2018super-activated\u2019 immune response to AI-PAMP. we suggest that modulation of the abnormal innate immune inflammation using a selective JAK3 inhibitor could be a novel and valuable strategy for the management of AI-associated severe pneumonia and immune suppression. mice were 6 to 8 weeks of age and weighed between 20 and 30 grams. mice were inoculated with 90 g of HA diluted with 100 l phosphate-buffered saline. a549 cells were seeded at 1106 cells per well in 6-well flat-bottom cell culture plates. they produced a confluent monolayer after overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C. the cultured cells were either treated with HA or a JAK3 inhibitor VI (760 nM) for 30 min prior to HA addition. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation, and supernatants were stored in aliquots at 80\u00b0C until further use. the protein was quantified using a BCA assay kit (Pierce, USA), and 100 g was used for SDS-PAGE electrophoresis. the reverse transcription reaction was conducted using superScriptTM III reverse transcription reagents (Invitrogen) we amplified previously generated cDNA by PCR using the following specific primers for IP-10, IRF-1 and GAPDH. reactions were predenatured at 94\u00b0C for 120 s, then cycled at 55\u00b0C for 50 s and 72\u00b0C for 60 s for 30 cycles. cytokines/chemokines included IL-2, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, tumour necrosis factor (TNF-), IFN-, IP-10, MCP-1, macrophage inflammatory protein 1 alpha (MIP-1), MIP-1 and regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) supernatants of the HA-treated cells were analysed on a LiquidChip system according to manufacturer's instructions. isolated spleen cells (1106 per well) were seeded into 96-well tissue culture plates and stimulated with LPS at different concentrations (10, 20 or 50 g) or PBS for 12 or 24 h at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO2. the plates were incubated for 4 h, and the optical density at 450 nm was measured using a microplate reader. pFastBacHT-H5HA was transposited into DH10Bac competent cells by homologous recombination. the recombinant HA (64 KDa) of H5N1 was purified from SF9 cells transfected with Bacmid-H5HA. mice were housed at a constant temperature (20\u00b0C) with a 12-hour light/dark photoperiod. mice were intratracheally inoculated with 90 g of HA diluted with 100 l phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) the control group received an equal volume of sterilised saline without HA. spleens were mechanically disrupted by pressing them through a nylon. mesh was deposited in a 25 cm2 flask containing 5 ml of RPMI 1640. the suspension was passed through a sterile nylon mesh to obtain the splenocytes. the pooled splenocytes were suspended with complete tissue culture medium. AK2, JAK3, STAT1 and NF-B (Cell Signalling, Frankfurt, Germany) were added and incubated for an additional 1 h. the secondary antibody was conjugated to HRP (Cell Signalling, Frankfurt, Germany) reactions were predenatured at 94\u00b0C for 120 s, denatured at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, then cycled at 55\u00b0C for 50 s and 72\u00b0C for 60 s for 30 cycles. PCR amplicons were analysed on 1.5% agarose gels, stained with ethidium bromide, and then visualised. two investigators blinded to the group assignments analysed the samples. all lung fields were examined for each sample at 20 magnification. the assessment of histological lung injury was performed as follows. Statistical analysis Comparisons among treatment groups were performed with a one-way-ANOVA test. a P value less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant."}
