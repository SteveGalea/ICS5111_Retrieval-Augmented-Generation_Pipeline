{"summary": "taiep rats exhibit hypomyelination and suffer progressive demyelination. this demyelinating process has been associated with nitrosative stress in vivo and in vitro [3, 4], glial-microglial activation and lymphocyte migration [4], and an increase in lipoperoxidation, caspase-3 activation, and cell death in vivo [5] the deficit of CXCL1 and CXCR2 causes failure in the myelination process due to an aberrant migration of OPCs in the spinal cord white matter [20]. chemokines and their receptors are important to determine whether a deregulation of chemokine expression profile occurs in the taiep rat. experimental animals were obtained from the vivarium of the Institute of Physiology, BUAP. Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were supplied by CINVESTAV vivarium. all procedures were in accordance with the Mexican current legislation. ELISA was used to determine the protein levels of CCL2, CCR1, CCR2, CCL5, CCR5, CCR8, CXCL1, CXCR2, CXCR4, FGF2 and VEGFA in homogenates obtained from the brainstem of SD or taiep rats at 1 and 6 months of age. the protein content was determined using the method by Sedmak and Grossberg. indirect Immunofluorescence CCR2, CCR5, CXCR2 and CXCR4 were detected in brain sagittal slices of 6-month-old SD and taiep rats (n = 3 per each group) each brain was included in paraffin and was cut into 3 m slices on the sagittal plane using a leica RM 2135 microtome (Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany) each brain was included in paraffin and was cut into 3 m slices on images were digitalized with a leica DC300F camera (Leica Microsystems, Nu\u00dfloch, Germany) and processed with a workstation Leica FW4000, version V1.2.1 (Leica Microsystems Vertrieb GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) differences between SD and taiep rats were determined with unpaired Student's t-test. animals were maintained in rooms with controlled conditions of temperature (22 1\u00b0C) and light-dark cycle (12 : 12 h light : dark; light onset at 07:00) all procedures were in accordance with the Mexican current legislation, the NOM-062-ZOO-1999 (SAGARPA) all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. ELISA plates were placed into wells to determine chemokines and receptors in separate assay. proteins were denatured by the addition of 100 L of 0.1 M carbonate buffer (pH 8.0) into each well and the plate was incubated for 18 h at 4\u00b0C. escence CCR2, CCR5, CXCR2 and CXCR4 were detected in brain sagittal slices of 6-month-old SD and taiep rats (n = 3 per each group) each brain was included in paraffin and was cut into 3 m slices on the sagittal plane using a leica RM 2135 microtome (Leica Microsystems, Nussloch, Germany) each brain was included in paraffin and was cut into 3 m slices on the sagittal images were digitalized with a leica DC300F camera (Leica Microsystems, Nu\u00dfloch, Germany) and processed with a workstation Leica FW4000, version V1.2.1 (Leica Microsystems Vertrieb GmbH, Bensheim, Germany) samples incubated with only the secondary antibodies were used as negative controls. differences between the groups with respect to age were determined with unpaired Student's t-test. taiep rat brainstem exhibits a decrease in inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokine. the black line indicates fold changes [2(Ct] of 1. taiep rats were found in Sprague-Dawley and taiep rats. alpha chemokines were also upregulated; CXCL10 at 1- (1.9, P = 0.02), CXCL11 at 1-month-old (2.6, P = 0.003) and VEGFA at 1- (4.8, P 0.05) SD1M = 1-month-old Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats; T1M = 1-month-old taiep rats; T6M = 6-month-old taiep rats; T6M = 6-month-old taiep rats. at 1 month of age, receptors that increased were CCR2 (43.5 5.1%), CCR8 (111.3 12.4%), CXCR4 (115.8 18.1%), and FGF2 (27.6% 4.1). the significance was established at P 0.05. immunofluorescence studies showed decreased intensity against CCR5 and CXCR4 in the brainstem of 6-month-old taiep rats. reduction in TGF-1 expression at 6-month-old taiep and SD rats may also be a sign of CNS aging. chemokine was upregulated in the brainstem of taiep rats. reduction of CCR5 in mice prevents macrophage infiltration and demyelination. lack of CCL5 supports cell death that occurs in taiep rats. lack of CXCL1 and CXCR4 proteins may also contribute to differentiation failure of OPCs. adenine-uridine-rich sequence elements (AREs) in their 3\u2032-untranslated regions are stabilized by acute proinflammatory stimulus. the 1-month-old taiep rat showed difference between mRNA and protein CXCR4 that might be due to two causes. mRNA and protein CXCR4 are decreased in the brainstem of 6-month-old taiep rats. the mutation in the taiep rats that causes the microtubule accumulation in the oligodendrocyte and the consequent hypomyelination is still unknown. further studies are needed to identify signal pathways and other mediators involved in the inflammatory response of the taiep rat."}
