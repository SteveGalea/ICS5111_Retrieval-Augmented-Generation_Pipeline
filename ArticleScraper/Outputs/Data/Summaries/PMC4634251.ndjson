{"summary": "a large proportion of children with influenza admitted to hospital receive antibiotics for suspected bacterial infection. 68% received intravenous antibiotics and 23% underwent lumbar puncture (LP) the following year, 2007, similar proportions of hospitalised children with confirmed influenza were given antibiotics. this year was chosen as it was a peak influenza year. 12 Respiratory syncytial virus infections were excluded from the study as it is already established that the rate of RSV and concomitant bacteraemia and meningitis is very low in children. positive samples had influenza A confirmed with antibodies (Imagen; DakoCytomation, Ely, UK) using direct fluorescent microscopy. a laboratory diagnosis was defined by identification of a virus either by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or by culture fluorescence. nasopharyngeal aspirates and/or nose/throat swabs collected between 1 January and 31 December 2007 were excluded from the study as it is already established that the rate of RSV and concomitant bacteraemia and meningitis is very low in children. positive samples had influenza A confirmed with antibodies (Imagen; DakoCytomation, Ely, UK) using direct fluorescent microscopy. a laboratory diagnosis was defined by identification of a virus either by direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) or by culture fluorescence. adenovirus, six parainfluenza 1 and five parainfluenza 2). Of the influenza cases, 25 (166%) were aged 3 months compared with nine of 144 (62%) in the ORVI group (P 001) the distribution of respiratory viruses by age group is shown in Figure 1. 054 Lowest SpO2 in emergency presentation (mean) 962 963 \u2013 059 Supplemental O2 requirements, n (%) 33 (229) 20 (133) 11 (10\u201312) 003 Highest HR in emergency presentation (mean) 1524 1597 \u2013 002 Highest RR in presentation (mean) 395 377 \u2013 024 SpO2, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation; HR, heart rate; ORVIs, other respiratory virus infections; RR only one child (09%) with laboratoryconfirmed influenza had bacteraemia (Enterobacter cloacae), and none in the ORVIs had bacteraemia (P = 09) there were no cases of bacterial meningitis in either group. a diagnosis of influenza (P = 002) and age 3 months (P 001) were the only significant independent predictors of a LP. a high temperature (395\u00b0C) or having a febrile convulsion was not predictive. influenzapositive cases were almost three times more likely (OR 28, 95% CI 14\u201359) to have a LP performed. 25 (166%) were aged 3 months compared with nine of 144 (62%) in the ORVI group (P 001) there were no significant differences in terms of gender, oxygen saturation and respiratory rate on presentation between the groups. n (%) 33 (229) 20 (133) 11 (10\u201312) 003 Highest HR in emergency presentation (mean) 1524 1597 \u2013 002 Highest RR in presentation (mean) 395 377 \u2013 024 SpO2, pulse oximeter oxygen saturation; HR, heart rate; ORVIs, other respiratory virus infections; RR, respiratory rate. 71% (107/150) of those with influenza had a blood culture performed compared with 56% (80/ there were no cases of bacterial meningitis in either group. only one child (09%) with laboratoryconfirmed influenza had bacteraemia (Enterobacter cloacae) and none in the ORVIs had bacteraemia (P = 09) independent predictors of having a blood culture performed on presentation were as follows: a diagnosis of influenza (P = 005) and temperature of 395\u00b0C (P 001), whereas age 3 months did not reach the level of significance (P = 006) most influenzapositive cases were presented during July and August, whereas the ORVI cases were predominant in an overlapping period between August and October. a prospective multicentre crosssectional study, conducted in the USA over 3 years from 1998 to 2001, showed that the risk of SBI in young infants was significantly lower in children with influenza compared with those without influenza. 7 The rate of SBI in young infants with RSV was also lower compared with those without influenza. this can partly be explained by the fact that children with influenza presented appearing clinically more unwell. study shows 17% of the children in the influenza group were younger than 3 months of age, while only 6% in the ORVI group were 3 months (P 001). bacterial meningitis is now rare in western Sydney. a study found that using influenza status alone, as a screening test for infants with SBI, resulted in a negative predictive value of 975% (95% CI 930\u2013992%) if the admitting consultant paediatrician were to review in person all cases being considered for LP, the proportion undergoing the procedure may well be reduced. a systematic review should be performed addressing the risk of concomitant influenza and bacterial meningitis. if still suspicious of concomitant bacterial meningitis, the senior admitting consultant can ensure the LP is performed.
