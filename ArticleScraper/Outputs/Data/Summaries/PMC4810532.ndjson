{"summary": "five to 20 million people worldwide are infected with human leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1), among them about 3% might develop adult T-cell leukemia (ATL), and another 1% could suffer from tropical spastic paraparesis. a combination of alpha interferon (IFN-) and zidovudine has emerged as the standard first-line therapy for ATL. cGAMP synthase (cGAS) is another key sensor of HIV-1. cGAS is a mammalian cyclic dinucleotide second messenger with noncanonical 2\u2032-5\u2032 phosphodiester linkage. cGAS and STING are highly relevant to HTLV-1 infection. both TBK1 and IRF3 have been shown to be activated by Tax. this leads to constitutive activation of IFN production. further investigations are required to clarify whether HTLV-1 and Tax might induce or suppress type I IFN production. cells were harvested for a dual-luciferase assay after another 24 h. cells were harvested for a dual-luciferase assay. expression vectors for tax, tax mutants, RIG-IN, RIG-I, TBK1, IKK, IRF3, IRF3-5D, and IRF7 have been described in our previous publications. antibodies were from Abcam (Cambridge, MA) Western blotting, native gel electrophoresis analysis of IRF3 dimerization, and coimmunoprecipitation were performed. cells were harvested 30 to 48 h after transfection for dual-luciferase assay as described previously (12, 40, 41). phosphorylated IRF3 was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. intensity of phosphorylated IRF3 was quantified by densitometry using ImageJ software. HEK293 cells, as well as HTLV-1 (Jurkat and CEMT4) and HTLV-1+ (MT2, MT4 and C8166) T cells were cultured and transfected. pIFN--Luc containing nucleotides 140 to +9 of human IFN-1 promoter was provided by Yuan Yan (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA) cGAS and STING were subcloned from IMAGE cDNA clones (6015929 and 5762441) RNA was analyzed by semiquantitative reverse transcription-PCR. the trailer sequence 5\u2032-ACCAGACAAGAGTTTAAGAGATAT-3\u2032 was used as forward and reverse primers. the primer sequences for tax, IFN-, and -actin transcripts have also been described. Sendai virus, a common and potent inducer of IFNs, was used to stimulate IFN- production in the infected cells. no induction was detected in tax-expressing MT2, MT4 and C8166 cells. RNAs were extracted at 24 h postinfection. expression of tax and IFN- (IFNB) transcripts was analyzed by quantitative RT-PCR. results represent means the SD of three independent experiments. we transfected into Jurkat cells a reporter plasmid driven by multiple copies of IRF3 binding sites, together with an expression vector for a constitutively active mutant of RIG-I named RIG-IN. both constructs have been described and used previously (12) 2 cells were cocultured with the transfected Jurkat cells. cells were harvested and assayed for dual-luciferase activity after another 24 h. tax suppresses IFN- induction at the step of IRF3 phosphorylation. the key step perturbed by tax in its suppression of IFN- induction by epistatic analysis. the expression of target proteins in the transfected cells was verified by Western blotting. tax was found to potently inhibit both IFN--Luc and IRF3-Luc activity induced by RIG-I+PACT, RIG-IN, TBK1 and IKK. tax had no influence on the activity of IRF3-5D. hek293 cells were transfected, and a luciferase assay was performed as in Fig. 4. cGAS pathway is more relevant to retroviral infection. cGAS pathway is more relevant to retroviral infection. tax mutants are defective for NF-B activation but retain the ability to activate CREB. all tax mutants exhibited an inhibitory effect on RIG-IN-induced IFN- production comparable to wild-type tax on IRF3 activation. tax was not detected in the TBK1 complex immunoprecipitated from Jurkat or CEMT4 cells. in panels C to E, HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. we first performed reciprocal immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting assays to examine the association of Tax with TBK1. in vitro kinase assay was performed with recombinant MBP-Tax and GST-IRF3 proteins purified from E. coli. incubation of GST-IRF3 with TBK1 resulted in phosphorylation of GST-IRF3 (Fig. 8C, lane 2 compared to lane 1). Phosphorylated IRF3 (IRF3P) was separated by SDS-PAGE and visualized by autoradiography. HTLV-1 suppresses the activation of IFN- production. we compared IFN- induction in three representative HTLV-1-transformed ATL cells. -induced activation of IFN- production was impeded in HTLV-1-transformed cells. similar inhibition of IFN- production was also observed in MT4 and C8166 cells infected with VSV-GFP. viral replication was more robust in HTLV-1-transformed cells. cells were fixed with freshly prepared 4% paraformaldehyde. the mean fluorescence intensity of infected cells with GFP signal was calculated using FlowJo software package. jurkat cells were transfected with pIRF3-Luc and escalating amounts of RIG-IN plasmid. cells were harvested for dual-luciferase assays after 48 h. only 5 to 10% of cells were transfected, as verified by confocal microscopy. HEK293 cells were transfected with expression plasmids for V5-tagged IRF3 (V5-IRF3), RIG-IN, and Tax. after 24 h, the cells were lysed and the dimerization of IRF3 was analyzed. tax suppresses IFN- induction at the step of IRF3 phosphorylation. tax was found to potently inhibit both IFN--Luc and IRF3-Luc activity induced by RIG-I+PACT, RIG-I+PACT, RIG-IN, TBK1, IKK, IRF3-5D, and IRF7. tax also repressed the activation of IRF3-Luc activity by IRF7. the results were statistically analyzed by Student t test. a fourth reporter construct pISRE-Luc was used to compare the effect of Tax on IRF3 and IRF3-5D. the activity of IRF3 to activate ISRE was fully susceptible to tax inhibition. Tax exhibited a moderate and dose-dependent suppressive effect on cGAS-induced activation of IRF3-Luc activity. tax suppression of IFN- production is independent of CREB or NF-B activation. tax mutants are defective for activation of either CREB or NF-B (28, 57, 58) tax and its mutants were capable of activating LTR-Luc or B-Luc to similar magnitude (Fig. 6C and D) they were expressed to comparable levels in transfected cells. the ability to activate CREB or NF-B is dispensable for tax suppression of type I IFN induction. tax was not detected in the TBK1 complex immunoprecipitated from Jurkat or CEMT4 cells. in panels C to E, HEK293 cells were transfected with plasmids expressing the indicated proteins. IKK, STING, and IRF3 have also been found in the TBK1 complex. reaction led to dose-dependent reduction of levels of phosphorylated GST-IRF3. TBK1 autophosphorylation was not observed in HEK293 cells. tax exerted an inhibitory effect on the IRF3 kinase activity of TBK1. the association of Tax with TBK1 and the consequent inhibition of the IRF3 kinase activity of TBK1 lent further support to the notion that Tax perturbs IRF3 phosphorylation. at least three routes operate in the suppression of innate IFN production and signaling by Tax. our findings that IFN- induction was compromised in HTLV-1-infected cells did not support the claim for activation of IFN- induction. we do not understand whether differences in experimental systems, sublines of cells, and other technical details might account for the opposite observations. effect of tax on IRF3 phosphorylation by TBK1 was not required for suppressive effect of tax on type I IFN induction. neither CREB nor NF-B activation was required for suppressive effect of tax on type I IFN induction. infected cells would allow us to identify agents and strategies to counteract tax and reestablish innate IFN response. both RIG-I and STING agonists have shown broad-spectrum antiviral effects (50, 65, 66)"}
