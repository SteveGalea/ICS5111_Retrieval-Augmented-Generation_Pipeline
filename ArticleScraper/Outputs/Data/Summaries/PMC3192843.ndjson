{"summary": "the coronavirus genome is predicted to encode several RNA processing enzymes that are not common to small RNA viruses [1], including nsp14 as an exoribonuclease and guanine N7-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) [6], [7], [8] and nsp15 as a nidovirus-specific endonuclease [9], [10]. methyl-guanine moiety is linked to the first transcribed nucleotide by a 5\u2032-5\u2032 triphosphate bridge. the cap structure is essential for efficient splicing, nuclear export, translation and stability of eukaryotic mRNAs. it has been suggested for three decades that coronavirus mRNA may carry a 5\u2032-cap structure. ribose 2\u2032-O-methylation of viral RNA cap provides a mechanism for viruses to escape host immune recognition [23], [24] for coronaviruses, several nsps have been indicated to be involved in viral RNA capping. nsp16 acts as 2\u2032-O-MTase in complex with nsp10. this mechanism is unique for 2\u2032-O-MTase of coronaviruses. this mechanism has not been found in any other viruses or host cells. molecular mechanisms underlying the enzymatic activity of nsp16 and the stimulatory effect of nsp10 are unknown. nsp14 alone could efficiently N7-methylate GpppA-RNA to generate cap-0 structure (m7GpppA) nsp10 did not significantly alter nsp14 N7-MTase activity in our testing system. nsp16 and nsp16 did possess the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity to convert cap-0 to cap-1 structure. similar observations were made by Bouvet et al. [25]. nsp14, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16, nsp16 Vaccinia VP39 2\u2032-O-MTase was used as a positive control. we tested whether SARS-CoV nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase has sequence specificity. nsp16/nsp10 could not methylate cap analogues and individual NTPs. the cap with a 5 nucleotide extension was sufficient as substrate for nsp16 [25] in this short RNA substrate, only the first nucleotide is identical with the first nucleotide A in the SARS-CoV genome RNA. nsp16 or nsp16/nsp10 complex need to form an RNA-binding groove that has enough space and affinity to accommodate m7GpppA-capped RNA with an extension of nsp10/nsp14/nsp16 could bind to SAM when complexed with nsp10. there were no signals at the position of nsp10 in SAM binding assays. nsp10 could boost nsp16 to bind the methyl donor SAM. ITC profiles for binding of SAM to nsp16, nsp10 and nsp16/nsp10 complex of SARS-CoV showed that the complex of nsp16 and nsp10 could bind SAM specifically but either nsp16 or nsp10 alone could not. the top panels in Figures 2B-D show raw ITC curves resulting from the injection of SAM into a solution of nsp16 ( nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind the methyl donor SAM and nsp16/nsp10 complex. the binding affinity of nsp16/nsp10 complex is moderate. the binding affinity of nsp16/nsp10 complex is moderate. nsp16 and nsp10 complex did not associate with m7GpppG-capped RNA. these results indicate that nsp16 promotes nsp16 to specifically bind m7GpppA-capped RNA. pull-down of nsp16 and nsp10 mixture by nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) resin gave rise to high level of radioactive signal for *m7Gp 32P-labeled m7G*pppA-RNA was incubated with nsp10, nsp16, and nsp16/nsp10 respectively (lanes 1\u20134) there was no protein in the mock as negative control (lane 4). nsp10 (with 2 mM ZnCl2) and nsp14 were used as positive controls (lanes 5\u20136) top panels represent raw data for sequential injections of nsp16, nsp10 and nsp16/nsp10 complex into m7GpppA-capped RNA (7 M) bottom panels show the plots of the heat evolved (kilocalories) per mole of purified proteins. cap analogues (m7GpppA and m7GpppG) were added to nsp16/nsp10 complex. but neither of the two cap analogues showed exothermic binding. this suggests that nsp10 plays an essential role in the specific binding of m7GpppA-capped RNA by nsp16/nsp10 complex. the protein mixture of purified nsp16 and nsp10 was supplemented with methyl donor SAM to obtain protein complex. crystals appeared readily in hanging drops and were diffracted to high resolution at 2.0 under X-rays from synchrotron radiation source. the structure was solved by multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction method. the difference between nsp16 and other 2\u2032-O-MTases is shown in the structure-based alignment of 2\u2032-O-MTases. the proteins are shown in ribbon with green (nsp10) and cyan (nsp16) the proteins are shown in ribbon with green (nsp10) and cyan (nsp16) Residues (Leu-45, Gly-70, Ala-71, His-80, Lys-93, Gly-94, Tyr-96) which interact with nsp16 are depicted in a stick model and colored by atoms. the main chain of nsp16 is show as ribbon and colored in light magenta. two zinc fingers were clearly identified in nsp10, which formed the center of two zinc fingers. the two zinc fingers render nsp10 the ability to bind polynucleotide chains in a nonselective manner in the presence of zinc ions [35], [36], [37]. the major difference lies in that the structure we solved contains the methyl donor SAM that was purposely supplemented in the protein mixture. significant contacts between nsp10 and nsp16 involve residues 40\u201347/69\u201384/93\u201396 of nsp10 and residues 37\u201348/76\u201391/102\u2013110/244\u2013248 of nsp16. close inspection revealed a cluster of important residues involved in nsp16-nsp10 interaction. a double mutant (H83A/P84A) and a triple mutant (Y76A/C77A/R78A) at the interaction surface of nsp10 were generated. the main chain N atom of Gly-70 in nsp10 formed a hydrogen bond with Asp-106 of nsp16. the single mutation G70A only slightly influences this main chain interaction. y96F mutation may strengthen hydrophobic interaction of nsp10 and nsp16. nsp16/nsp10 MTase activity is more important than hydrogen bond made by its hydroxyl group. biochemical analysis of critical residues involved in interaction interface was consistent with structural observations. nsp16, nsp16/nsp10, and nsp5 were negative controls. nsp16, nsp16/nsp10, and nsp10 were negative controls. nsp16, nsp16/nsp10, and nsp10 were used as controls. the 2\u2032- and 3\u2032-OH of the adenosine ribose of SAM are stabilized by the side chain of Asp-99 and the side chain of Leu-100 via hydrogen bonds. the hydrophobic patch packs against Met-131 and the hydrophobic main chain of Tyr-132. the amino group of the methionine moiety of SAM is maintained by three polar contacts. the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10 complex shows that the SAM binding cleft of nsp16 is composed of three loops: loop 71\u201379 (residues 71\u201379) together with loop 100\u2013108 (residues 100\u2013108) forming a wall on one side of the cleft and loop 130\u2013148 (residues 130\u2013148) nsp16/nsp10 complex is postulated to be more stable than that of nsp16. one hydrogen bond forms between Lys-93 of nsp10 and Ser-105 of nsp16. two salt bridges exist between His-80 ND1 and NE2 from nsp10. both ser-105 and Asp-102 of nsp16 are located in the flexible loop region 100\u2013108. the central groove of nsp16 is positively charged (Figures 7C and 7D) the phosphate backbone of the cap-containing RNA is highly negatively charged. nsp16 is built by two flexible loops (residues 26-38 and residues 130\u2013148) the warm colored regions are highly flexible and mobile. the K-D-K-E motif residues of nsp16 (Lys-46, Asp-130, Lys-170 and Glu-203) are shown as sticks and colored in magenta. m7GpppA-RNA was derived from the structure of vaccinia virus 2\u2032-O-MTase VP39 (PDB entry: 1AV6) and m7GpppA-RNA was mutated manually from m7GpppG-RNA. the first three transcriptional nucleotides are contacted with nsp16 and the following transcriptional nucleotides are contacted with nsp10. nsp16 nsp10 possesses two zinc-finger motifs and has the ability to bind polynucleotides nonspecifically in presence of zinc ions. the RNA binding by the nsp10 portion may contribute to hold the extended RNA chain following the m7GpppA cap and stabilize the interaction between m7GpppA-RNA and nsp16 cap binding site. SARS-CoV nsp14/nsp16/nsp10 complex was previously predicted to be 2\u2032-O-MTase [1], [29], although a low 2\u2032-O-MTase activity was demonstrated for feline coronavirus nsp16 [26]. nsp14 alone could efficiently N7-methylate GpppA-RNA to generate cap-0 structure (m7GpppA), nsp10 did not significantly the mixture of nsp10/nsp14/nsp16 gave rise to cap-1 structure (m7GpppAm) nsp14 and nsp10 (nsp16/nsp10) did possess the 2\u2032-O-MTase activity to convert cap-0 to cap-1 structure at pH 7.5 and 8.0 (Figure 1A, lanes 10 and 16) nsp16/nsp10 (at pH 7.5), nsp10, nsp14, nsp16/nsp10, nsp14/nsp16, nsp16/nsp10, and nsp14/nsp16 respectively (at pH 8.0) the markers G*pppA (lane 8), m7G*pppA (lane 9), and m7G*pppAm (lane m7GpppA- and m7GpppG-capped RNAs were used as substrates for nsp16/nsp10. the VP39 2\u2032-O-MTase of vaccinia virus was used as a control in the methylation assay system. nsp16/nsp10 could not methylate cap analogues and individual NTPs. nsp10 promotes binding of the cofactor SAM to nsp16 SAM is the methyl donor for both N7- and 2\u2032-O-MTase in RNA cap methylation. nsp16 alone or the complex of nsp10 and control proteins were not able to bind SAM at different pH values. however, nsp16 could bind SAM when complexed with nsp10. the top panels represent the raw data for sequential injections of SAM into nsp16, nsp10 and nsp16/nsp10 complex. the top panels represent the raw data for sequential injections of SAM into nsp16, nsp10 and nsp16/nsp10 complex (D), respectively. nsp16/nsp10 complex is exothermic, resulting in random peaks around 0-baseline in the plots of power versus time. adding SAM to either nsp16 or nsp10 alone is exothermic, resulting in random peaks around 0-baseline in the plots of power versus time. nsp10 is required for nsp16 to bind the methyl donor SAM and nsp16/nsp10 complex. binding affinity of nsp16/nsp10 complex is moderate. nsp10 assists nsp16 in binding m7GpppA-capped RNA. nsp16/nsp10 complex had a low binding affinity to *m7GpppA-capped RNA. nsp16/nsp10 complex had a low binding affinity to m7GpppA-capped RNA. the pulled-down proteins were further checked by Western blotting to confirm the presence of the indicated proteins. the top panels represent the raw data for sequential injections of nsp16, nsp10 and nsp16/nsp10 complex into m7GpppA-capped RNA (7 M) the bottom panels show the plots of the heat evolved (kilocalories) per mole of purified proteins. m7GpppA-capped RNA binding to nsp16/nsp10 complex is exothermic. all others were apyretic, resulting in random peaks around 0-baseline in the plots of power versus time. binding affinity of nsp16/nsp10 complex with m7GpppA-capped RNA is higher than that with SAM. the association of nsp10 with nsp16 may provide a proper groove for binding and holding of m7GpppA-capped RNA substrate. we thus expected to reveal the details of SAM- and RNA-binding and stimulation mechanisms from the crystal structure of nsp16/nsp10. the structure of nsp16 (Figures 4A and 4B) exhibits the characteristic fold of the class I MTase family, comprising a seven-stranded -sheet surrounded by -helices and loops [32] the most significant difference lies in the D helix, visible on the surface of FtsJ (Figure S1E) but invisible for nsp16 (Figure S1B) 2\u2032-O-MTases are shown in the structure-based alignment of 2\u2032-O-MTases. proteins are shown in ribbon with green (nsp10) and cyan (nsp16) the proteins are shown in ribbon with green (nsp10) and cyan (nsp16) the main chain of nsp16 is shown as ribbon and colored in light magenta. the main chain of nsp16 is shown as ribbon and colored in light magenta. hydrogen bonds and salt bridges are shown as yellow dotted lines. the structure we solved contains the methyl donor SAM that was purposely supplemented in the protein mixture. the one by Decroly and colleagues contains S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) which is the product of SAM after methyltransfer. the atomic coordinates of nsp16/nsp16 structure solved by Decroly et al. have not been released until now. intermolecular hydrogen bonds exist between Gly-70/Ala-71/Gly-94 of nsp10 and Asp-106 of nsp16, Lys-93 of nsp10 and Ser-105 of nsp16. there are two salt bridges between His-80 (nitrogen atoms ND1 and NE2) of nsp10 and Asp-102 (oxygen atom OD2) of nsp16. the main chain N atom of Gly-70 in nsp10 formed a hydrogen bond with Asp-106 of nsp16. the single mutation G70A only slightly influences this main chain interaction. it impaired the SAM- and RNA-binding activity of nsp16. similar results were obtained by Lugari et al., except for an Y96F mutation. se P1-resistant cap structures released from 32P-labeled m7G*pppA-RNA methylated by nsp16/nsp10 G70A, nsp16/nsp10 K93A, nsp16/nsp10 Y76A/C77A/R78A, and nsp16/nsp10 H83A/P84A. m7GpppA-RNA was used to test nsp16, nsp10, and nsp5 were negative controls (n = 2, mean values SD). ligand SAM lies at the C-terminus of strands 1 and 2, similar to most SAM-dependent MTases [32]. the adenosine moiety of SAM is stacked among Phe-149, Met-131 and Cys-115 in nsp16 through Van der Waals force. yl O atom interacts with side chain Asn-43. all residues and SAM are shown as sticks, water as blue dots, and hydrogen bonds as green dotted lines. -independent 2\u2032-O-MTases is shorter than that of nsp16 (loop 130\u2013148) in the SAM-binding pocket of nsp16, the corresponding loop (loop 130\u2013148) is long and flexible while the supporting rigid D helix is short. these structural features may make the SAM-binding cleft more flexible and thus in need of extra support from the stimulatory factor nsp10. structure-based alignment of nsp16 with VP39, NS5 MTase and FtsJ highlights these four strictly conserved residues in nsp16. the central groove of nsp16 is positively charged, and the phosphate backbone of the cap-containing RNA is highly negatively charged. nsp16 alone shows an extraordinary low affinity for both m7GpppA-RNA and m7GpppA cap analogue in biochemical assays. the structural model of nsp16/nsp10 complex is colored by the Debye-Waller factor, based on which the warm colored regions are highly flexible and mobile. the methyl group of SAM is shown as sticks and colored in yellow. the m7GpppA-RNA is shown as sticks and colored in yellow. the first two nucleotides are colored by atoms and the next nucleotides are colored in magenta. sp10 is involved in substrate RNA binding in nsp16/nsp10 complex. the existence of nsp10 extends the positively charged area. nsp16/nsp10 complex showed increased binding affinity for m7GpppA-capped RNA. m7GpppA alone is not long enough to reach the extended positively charged area provided by nsp10. the residue Asp-75 (D75) stretches out to the C2 atom of first transcribed nucleotide. the binding pocket for substrate RNA of nsp16/nsp10 complex appears more limited. m7GpppA-RNA exhibits a relatively low affinity to the nsp16/nsp10 complex. nsp10 is structurally homologous to cap 2\u2032-O-MTase with a truncation of the SAM-binding domain. nsp10 acts as a buttress supporting the seemingly flexible loop 100\u2013108 critically involved in SAM-binding. similar results were obtained for H80R mutation. the K93A mutation caused an overall decrease by 60% in the 2\u2032-O MTase activity of nsp16/nsp10 complex. it was reported that alanine replacements of nsp10 in MHV resulting in lethal phenotypes mapped to a central core of nsp10 that is resistant to mutation. the existence of nsp10 dodecamer structure during viral infection could not be excluded because nsp10 is translated up to several times more than nsp16 [51], [52] and the surplus nsp10 may form structures other than the nsp16/nsp10 complex. this observation suggests that fusion of nsp10 with nsp9 should not disrupt the essential activities of nsp10 involved in virus replication. nsp10 could interact with both 2\u2032-O-MTase nsp16 and N7-MTase nsp14 [30], [31], suggesting that a single nsp10 molecule or its dimer could associate with both nsp16 and nsp14 at the same time in the RTC. further experiments are needed to confirm this model. the nsp16 2\u2032-O-MTase is sequence-dependent as it could only methylate m7GpppA-capped RNA. the first nucleotide is absolutely restricted to adenosine. the unknown coronavirus GTase may also contribute to the specificity of coronavirus capping enzymes. nsp10 promoted the substrate and co-substrate binding of nsp16. nsp10 promoted the substrate and co-substrate binding of nsp16. the current findings provide insights into the mechanism of SARS-CoV 2\u2032-O-methylation. pET30a-His6-nsp10-nsp11 and pET30a-His6-thrombin-nsp16 transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were grown at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium with 50 g/mL kanamycin and induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl -D- thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 protein crystals were eluted with buffer A supplemented with 250 mM imidazole, and 0.5 mM SAM. after shaking at 4\u00b0C for 10 hours and centrifugation, the protein sample was further purified on a Superdex 200 column (GE) equilibrated with buffer A. the nsp16/nsp10 complex was degraded during the process, data not shown. glycerol and diffraction data were collected on beamline BL-17U1 at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) for native protein complex crystal. beamline 1W2B at Beijing Synchrotron Radiation Facility (BSRF) for seMet labeled nsp16/nsp10 complex crystal. the interface between RNA and nsp16/nsp10 was optimized by energy minimization using PHENIX [64] for 3 cycles. RNA substrates representing the 5\u2032-terminal 259 nucleotides of the SARS-CoV genome were in vitro transcribed, 32P-labeled at cap structures (m7G*pppA-RNA, G*pppA-RNA, or m7G*pppG-RNA, where the * indicates the 32P-labeled cap analogue (m7G*pppA or m7G*pppG) and 3H-labeled cap analogue (*m7GpppA or *m7GpppG) were digested from m7G*pppA-RNA/m7G*pppA-RNA and *m7GpppA-RNA/*m7GpppG-RNA by nuclease P1 (Sigma MTase activity assays carried out in 30 L reaction mixture [40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM DTT, 40 units RNase inhibitor, 0.01 mM SAM] with 1 Ci of S-adenosyl [methyl-3H] methionine (67.3 Ci/mmol, 0.5 Ci/l), 1 g of purified proteins or mutant proteins. gel shift assay provides a simple and rapid method for detecting RNA-binding proteins. 1 g of purified proteins and 4103 cpm of 32P-labeled RNA substrates were added to 20 L reaction mixtures. ITC experiments on the interaction of SAM with nsp16, nsp10, and nsp16/nsp10 complex of SARS-CoV in the absence of DTT were carried out at 25\u00b0C using a VP-ITC titration calorimeter. nsp16, nsp10, and nsp16/nsp10 complex were dialyzed against 40 mM Tris-HCl buffer (p nsp10 complex of SARS-CoV with m7GpppA-capped RNA in the absence of DTT were carried out at 25\u00b0C using an ITC200 titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) a solution of m7GpppA-capped RNA (7 M) was loaded into the sample cell (500 L), and a solution of 100 M purified proteins were placed in the injection syringe (40 L nsp10-nsp11 fusion protein and nsp16 genes were cloned into pET30a (Novagen) to produce recombinant proteins carrying an N-terminal His6-tag. mutants of nsp10 (G70A, K93A, Y76A/C77A/R78A, and H83A/P84A) were generated by overlap PCR with mutagenic primers. nsp3 (nsp3-SUD), nsp5, n-terminal domain of nsp12 (nsp12N) and nsp14 protein expression and purification were described previously. sequences of the cDNA and proteins have been deposited in GenBank database with accession numbers listed at end of 'Materials and Methods' the expression and purification conditions of nsp16 and nsp10 protein complex were the same as for native nsp16/nsp10 complex. modified M9 medium was used instead of LB medium during the expression of nsp16. crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. a preliminary model was readily built up by Phenix package [60] from derivative data, which covered around 60% of whole structure. the model was then used for refining and manual building against high resolution native diffraction data. the sole nsp10 structure was introduced into the complex by molecular replacement. RNAs containing 32P-labeled cap-1 structure (m7G*pppA-RNA) as positive control were converted from cap-0 structure m7G*pppA-RNA by a vaccinia virus capping enzyme following the manufacturer's protocol (Epicentre) the 32P-labeled cap analogue (m7G*pppA-RNA or *m7GpppG-RNA) and 3H-labeled cap structures (*m7G all the RNA substrates were extracted with phenol-chloroform and precipitated with ethanol. the unlabeled cap analogues (m7GpppA, GpppA, and m7GpppG) were purchased from new England BioLabs. 3H-labeled product was isolated in small DEAE-Sephadex columns. reaction mixtures containing 1 g of purified proteins and 1 Ci of S-adenosyl [methyl-3H] methionine. the reactions were incubated at room temperature for 25 min. RNA substrate bands were quantitated by scanning gels with a PhosphorImager. the binding reactions were shaken at 4\u00b0C over night. nsp16, nsp10, and nsp16/nsp10 complex of SARS-CoV in the absence of DTT were carried out at 25\u00b0C using a titration calorimeter (MicroCal, Northampton, MA) freshly purified nsp16 and nsp10 proteins were mixed, and their final concentrations were 10 M and 80 M, respectively. the resulting data were fitted to a single set of identical sites model. the binding stoichiometry, N, the standard molar free energy change, and the standard molar entropy change, for the binding reaction were calculated by the fundamental equations of thermodynamics: = ; = (-)/T. nsp16/nsp10 (B), vaccinia virus VP39 (PDB entry 1AV6) (C), dengue virus NS5 MTase (PDB entry 1L9K) (D), Escherichia coli FtsJ (PDB entry 1EJ0) (E) and bluetongue virus VP4 2\u2032-O-MTase (PDB entry 2JHP) (F) are shown as sticks and colored in nsp10 from SARS-CoV, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), bovine coronavirus (BcoV), murine hepatitis virus (MHV), transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) the secondary structure of SARS-CoV nsp10 is shown above."}
