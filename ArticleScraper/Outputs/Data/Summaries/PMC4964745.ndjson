{"summary": "influenza affects between 5% and 10% adults, and 20% to 30% of children each year leading to 3 to 5 million severe illnesses and 250,000 to 500,000 fatalities. of the 3 influenza virus types (A, B, and C), epidemiologically only types A and B are important. influenza is one of the most common causes of viral RTIs among Hajj pilgrims. the attack rate of laboratory-proven influenza among symptomatic Hajj pilgrims ranges between 4% and 15%. the vaccine uptake has increased in the last decade from 27.3% in 2005 to > 80% in 2014 among pilgrims from industrialized countries. for each season in both hemispheres, data on antigenic characteristics of the viruses were collated and compared to the vaccine strains recommended by the WHO. mismatching was defined if the circulating strains were totally different, or showed substantially reduced titer against the vaccine strains. changes in vaccine strains in the northern hemisphere followed the change in southern hemisphere vaccine strains in 4 seasons. similar phenomena repeated 8 times in the last 12 y. nia, A/H3N2-Perth, B-Brisbane Southern: 2009; Northern: 2009\u20132010 A/H1N1-Brisbane, A/H3N2-Brisbane, B-Florida A/H1N1-Brisbane, A/H3N2-Brisbane, B-Brisbane Southern: 2008; Northern: 2008\u20132009 A/H1N1- Solomon Islands, A/ the widely used vaccine strain is A/Panama/2007/99. italic strains appear firstly in the southern vaccine before appearing in the northern vaccine of the following season. influenza A was the predominant circulating type in all seasons in northern hemisphere between 2003 and 2014. influenza A/H3N2 was the commonest strain in 6 seasons (from 2003 to 2007, and 2012) while influenza A/H1N1 was the prevalent strain in the other 5 seasons including the influenza pandemic year 2009. the proportion of overall matching was as high as 68% in 2010, and lowest (3%) in 2003. worldwide, when it comes to subtype, influenza A/H1N1 was the most dominant subtype at Hajj (39%), while globally, influenza A/H3N2 was the most prevalent subtype (45%). antigenic characterization of influenza viruses has been studied infrequently at Hajj. between 3% and 14% of symptomatic vaccinated pilgrims had laboratory-proven influenza in 2005, 2006 January, 2006 December and 2009. 39 (71%) influenza B-Sichuan, 1 (2%) influenza B-Hong Kong 8/415 (2%) vaccinated, none had influenza Alanzi F et al. 35 2005 International 47/483 (7.9%) had influenza: 36 (77%) A, 11 (23%) B; serotypes were: 16 (34%) A/H1N1, 6 (13%) A/H3N2, 14 (30%) A/untyped, 8 (17%) influenza B-Sichuan, (8%) had influenza: 22 (39%) A/H1N1, 12 (21%) A/H3N2, 15 (26%) influenza B Sichuan, 8 (14%) influenza B/Hong Kong 192/713 (27%) vaccinated, Barasheed O et al. 40 2011 Australia 8/80 (10%) had influenza: 5 (62.5%) A, 3 (37.5%) B Not reported Benkouiten S et al. 9 2012 France Before Hajj 1/165 (0.6 the WHO biannually recommends the influenza vaccine individually for north and south hemispheres. the recommended strains over 12 years are shown in Table 1. vaccine strains were similar for both hemispheres in 4 seasons.
