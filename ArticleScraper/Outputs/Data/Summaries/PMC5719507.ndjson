{"summary": "emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) and reemerging infectious diseases (RIDs) are diseases that occur for the first time in the world, a defined region or a given population. many EIDs and RIDs are zoonotic, can be transmitted from animals to human hosts. each of these countries has some endemic infectious diseases that can be a threat to their neighboring countries, including Iran (10, 11). legal and illegal immigrants and refugees from these countries and international travels can be the source of some of EIDs or RIDs in Iran (12). the review is divided into viral, bacterial, parasitic and fungal infectious diseases and can serve as a practical summary. the majority of confirmed human cases in Iran have been butchers, slaughterhouse workers and farmers. most of the infected cases have occurred in south-eastern Iran, Sistan and Baluchistan province, close to the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan. an additional factor is the large number of afghan refugees and immigrants in this province. WNV is the most widespread Flavivirus, distributed in Africa, America, Australia, South of Europe, West of Asia and the Middle East. serological investigations in the 1970s showed the presence of WNV antibody in human populations in several provinces in Iran (15, 48). in a cross-sectional study performed on blood donors in Tehran in 2005, five percent of the donors were seropositive for WNV (50). in 2008, the first case of dengue fever was reported in Iran in a patient that had previously travelled to Malaysia (57). in a study among 300 Iranian patients tested negative for CCHFV between 2000 and 2012, 5% were serologically or molecularly positive for DF. 6% of all blood donors were asymptomatically seropositive for DV. cultural changes and increased risky behavior among young people in this country have increased the vulnerability of the country to HIV/AIDS. increasing the knowledge and awareness regarding HIV/AIDS transmission and prevention is one of the most crucial preventive methods among different groups. patients with hemophilia have antibodies against HCV (96\u201399) the HCV genome pattern has changed in recent years in Iran. it seems that such a change can be due to cross-border travels between Iran, Pakistan and Iraq (82). HTLV-1 is present all over the world with clusters of high endemicity in Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the Caribbean area and some foci in the Middle East (112). HTLV-1 was first reported in the Middle East in 1983 and the first clinical report matching to ATL in Iran was from Mashhad, in northeastern Iran, in 1986 (113, 114). the virus rapidly spread through USA and Canada and caused a pandemic. WHO asked the countries to screen the infection in all suspected patients (135, 136) the highest reported cases belonged to the central and eastern provinces. the fifth patient was a 67-year-old woman who died of MERS-CoV (146) by the end of 2014, eight MERS-CoV cases were confirmed among camels, illegally imported from Pakistan into Sistan and Baluchistan province in south-eastern Iran. the first human Q fever infection in Iran was reported in 1952. the next Q fever case was reported 50 years later in 2009. goats have the highest seroprevalence (66\u201369%) among livestock. plague pandemics have killed millions of humans in africa, Europe, Asia and America. most of Iran\u2019s neighbors have reported the disease during the last centuries. most of Iran\u2019s neighbors have reported the disease during the last centuries. farmers, veterinarians, hunters, butchers, cooks and laboratory staff have the most risk of the infection (187\u2013189). there are human and animal tularemia reports from countries neighboring Iran including Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Armenia and Turkey (190\u2013192). the seropositivity is found in humans and in a vast range of animals living in different parts of the country. leptospirosis often remains unrecognized in most parts of the country due to its unspecificity of sign and clinical symptoms. most cases are reported in Mazandaran province, northern Iran (206) around 3.6% of 8.6 million new cases of TB are thought to be multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in the world (224). TB is the form of Mycobacterium tuberculosis that is resistant to at least Isoniazid and Rifampin, the two most powerful first-line anti-TB drugs (225). rates in sistan and baluchistan province have declined from 36 per 100,000 to 24 per 100,000 cases in 1990 and 2013 respectively. in 2006, the existence and transmission of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) among patients with MDR-TB were reported in Iran (234, 235) the misdiagnosis of NTM infection with MDR-TB may lead to wrong treatment of TB patients. zoonotic disease occurs primarily in horses, mules and donkeys. this highly contagious pathogen is transmitted to humans by direct contact with infected animals. hepaticais is present in Europe, Africa, Asia, the Americas. most human cases of Fasciolosis in Asia have been reported from Iran. the disease is at endemic levels in Gilan province, northern Iran. drug resistant malaria is considered a challenge in malaria control and elimination programs in these endemic regions (275) studies have assessed the response of P. falciparum to chloroquine in the endemic region from 1968 to 1976. chloroquine-resistant cases were found for the first time among 5.7% of the infected cases in 1983 in the Iran-Shahr district. microsporidiosis is an opportunistic intestinal infection caused by a group of obligatory intracellular parasitic fungi (282) it is considered an emerging infectious disease (283) which is most frequently reported among immunocompromised people (282). it often results in weight loss and wasting syndrome and in certain cases in developing countries, it leads to death (284). the number of CCHF-endemic provinces has substantially increased in recent years (20\u201322) the majority of confirmed human cases in Iran have been butchers, slaughterhouse workers and farmers. most of the infected cases have occurred in south-eastern Iran, Sistan and Baluchistan province, close to the borders of Afghanistan and Pakistan. birds, horses, mosquitoes and human patients are the primary natural reservoirs of the virus. the infection is mainly found in wetland ecosystems (45). DF is the most widespread Flavivirus, distributed in Africa, America, Australia, South of Europe, West of Asia and the Middle East. aedes aegypti, the most significant vector of DV, has not been reported in Iran. in 2008, the first case of dengue fever was reported in Iran in a patient that had previously travelled to Malaysia (57) in 2008, the first case of dengue fever was reported in Iran in a patient that had previously travelled to Malaysia (57) phylogenetic analysis of HIV indicates that HIV-1 subtype B and A are the frequent subtype among hemophilia patients and injecting drug users. cultural changes and increased risky behavior among young people in this country have increased the vulnerability of the country to HIV/AIDS. in 2007, the infection rate varied between 15.7% and 63.8% (95) 15 to 91% of all patients with hemophilia have antibodies against HCV (96\u201399) the HCV genome pattern has changed during recent years in Iran. first known human oncogenic retrovirus, is the causative agent of HTLV-I-associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP) and adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) it is present all over the world with clusters of high endemicity in Japan, sub-Saharan Africa, South America, the Caribbean area and some foci in the Middle East (112). virus rapidly spread through USA and Canada and caused a pandemic. WHO asked the countries to screen the infection in all suspected patients (135, 136) the RNA was confirmed in a woman in may 2014. the fifth patient was a 67-year-old woman who died of MERS-CoV. by the end of 2014, eight MERS-CoV cases were confirmed among camels. crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is the most significant tick-borne viral human infection which is reported sporadically across a vast geographic area. the first infection by CCHF virus (CCHFV) in Iran was reported in the early 1970s, when CCHFV antibodies were detected in livestock and human serum samples. since 1975, the surveys on livestock have revealed 3.8 to 100% infection rate in different parts of the country. in 2007, ostriches were first identified as the probable host transmitting the disease to humans in Iran (38) the virus was isolated among 4.3 to 28% of the ticks studied in different areas (36, 39\u201342) loss of consciousness in Isfahan province, in the central part of the country, were WNV positive using RT\u2013PCR (51) in 2010\u20132011, 1.3% of the general population and 2.8% of the horses were seropositive for WNV (52). in 2009, a large-scale sero-survey of the equine population in various regions indicated 23.7% of the horses were positive for WNV antibodies (53). in southwestern Iran, WNV antibody was reported among 70% of the horses between entomological studies are recommended to clarify the situation of potential vectors in Iran. the infection remains low in the general population (1%) (61), but certain groups such as injecting drug users (IDUs) (10.7%), prison inmates (3.2%), female sex workers (5%) and homeless people (4%) were shown to be at greater risk of the infection (62\u201368) in 1994, 0.25% of seroconversion for HCV infection for the first time in Iran (79) the infection amongst blood donors is 0.1 to 0.5% in different cities of the country (83\u201386). the main route of HCV transmission among hemophilia and thalassemia patients is through blood products (89\u201393). attention to OBI has increased due to its potential role in accelerating the progression of liver fibrosis and cirrhosis. it is transmitted via blood transfusion and transplantation (100) HTLV-1 is the first known human oncogenic retrovirus in the middle east. a blood donor-based study showed a low rate (0\u20130.5%) of infection in other parts of the country. HTLV-1 then showed a slight increase (3%) among Mashhadi blood donors until 1995 (122). Afterwards, the rate of infection decreased during the next three years to 2%, 0.77% and 0.45%, respectively. a survey in Shiraz airport, south of Iran, on hajj pilgrims who returned from mecca in 2009 revealed 1.6% of the infection with swine influenza (140) screening of travelers in entering borders is suggested for early detection and inhibition of the pathogen (140). the surveillance system should be ready to screen the high risk groups and suspected cases to rapidly detect and control the disease. the disease has been reported in turkey, a neighboring country of Iran. it is recommended to conduct seroepidemiological surveys in humans and rodents in various geographical regions of the country. slaughterhouse workers are considered high-risk groups in west and southeast of the country with 68% and 38% seropositivity. goats are the major reservoir of the bacterium in Iran, having the highest seroprevalence (66\u201369%) among livestock (161). goats are the major reservoir of the bacterium, having the highest seroprevalence (66\u201369%) among livestock (161). plague is an ancient disease that has been recorded since the sixth century. in the 20th century, plague vaccination programs were conducted and resulted in the control of the disease. in the 20th century, plague vaccination programs were conducted. tularemia seroprevalence was detected in butchers and other slaughterhouse workers in Sistan and Baluchistan province (189) and among children in Chaharmahal and Bakhtiari province in southwestern Iran (194) 14.4% of seropositivity was shown among high-risk groups in Kurdistan province (195) most cases of the disease are reported in Mazandaran province, northern Iran (206) the main risk factors of the disease are working in paddy, keeping animals, contact with rodents and swimming in rivers (208, 209) about 4% of cases with recently detected TB were resistant to the first line TB antibiotics (225) 14% of previously treated cases were diagnosed as MDR-TB in East Azerbaijan, northwestern Iran (226). mycobacteria fortuitum, M. kansasii, M. abscessus and M. avium complex have been shown as the most frequent types of NTM in Iran. the misdiagnosis of NTM infection with MDR-TB may lead to wrong treatment of TB patients. the history of glanders in Iran goes back to about a century ago when the disease was reported from almost all parts of the country. the outbreak of disease was reported among horses and humans in 1974. after that, the infection was not reported up to 1994 when it was confirmed among horses in the central part of the country. vine Q fever seropositivity ranges from 13 to 30% in different provinces. it is a major cause of abortion in animals with the C. burnetii genome being found in aborted fetuses in ten provinces (163). Ticks would also play an important role in the transmission of Q fever. y. pestis has been isolated from wild rodents, as the main reservoirs, in Kurdistan province in various surveys. a recent study in 2011\u20132012 showed persistence of plague infection in dogs and rodent population in Kurdistan. there are human and animal tularemia reports from countries neighboring Iran including Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Armenia and Turkey. leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, caused by leptospira spp., with a worldwide distribution. it has reemerged during the last decades in Iran (196, 197) 79 patients were confirmed for leptospirosis in 1999. different surveys of animals have revealed the Leptospirosis infection rate to be up to 43% in horses (211, 212), 37% in cattle (213\u2013217), 37 % in dogs (218), 18.5% in sheep and goats (219, 220), as well as infections in cats and donkeys (212, 221, 222). instruction of preventive measures to rice farmers, animal keepers and persons living and/or finding themselves near rivers can decrease the infection transmission to humans. the highest prevalence of MDR-TB was reported in Sistan and Baluchistan province (11.5%) and Isfahan (6.5%) in 2005. the trend of TB incidence has considerably shown lower rates in Iran than in the neighboring countries during the last decade. mycobacteria fortuitum, M. kansasii, M. abscessus and M. avium complex have been shown as the most frequent types of NTM in Iran (241) since 2002, multiple species have been reported as emerging agents in the country. improvement of NTM laboratory detection methods is highly recommended in all parts of the country. the infection was not reported up to 1994 when it was confirmed among horses in the central part of the country (256). subsequently, some cases of glanders were reported when four african lions and one siberian tiger died in Tehran zoo with clinical signs of the disease in 2012 (257). unfortunately this disease has either no vaccine or immunization method. most liver condemnations due to a Fascioliasis infection are reported in slaughtered cattle (266\u2013268, 270). aquatic snails of Lymnaeidae family are the intermediate hosts in the transmission of liver flukes (268). malaria is a major global health problem. in 1999, the rates of resistance to chloroquine, amodiaquine, sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine in the endemic regions were 33.4%, 15.2%, 17.9%, 2.2% respectively. a sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) combination was introduced as the first-line drug after the development of resistance to chloroquine in the country (275, 281). the tested samples have shown no sulfadoxine\u2013pyr Fasciolosis is a zoonotic disease caused by the liver flukes of the genus Fasciola (258) most human cases of Fasciolosis in Asia have been reported from Iran. the disease is at endemic levels in Gilan province, northern Iran. malaria has had an endemic pattern in the southern and southeastern regions of Iran, including Hormozgan, southern Kerman and Sistan and Baluchistan provinces. drug resistant malaria is considered a challenge in malaria control and elimination programs in these endemic regions (275) microsporidiosis is an opportunistic intestinal infection caused by a group of obligatory intracellular parasitic fungi (282) it is considered an emerging infectious disease (283) which is most frequently reported among immunocompromised people (282). it often results in weight loss and wasting syndrome and in certain cases in developing countries, it leads to death (284). some other EIDs or RIDs in Iran are blood borne or sexually transmitted diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis C, Occult Hepatitis B and Human T-cell leukemia. continuing bio-behavioral surveys among high risk groups are essential to have a better view of their epidemiology and trend leading to better management and controlling. increasing training programs is highly recommended to more or less control these diseases. the development of specialized clinical laboratories in all parts of the country is an important basis to diagnose the diseases in the shortest possible time. the development of an integrated response to multiple threats posed by climatic changes, vector-borne diseases, and emerging threats seems to be a realistic way forward."}
