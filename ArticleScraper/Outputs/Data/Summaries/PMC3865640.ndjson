{"summary": "the most common viral causes of ARTI worldwide include respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), influenza viruses (IFVs), enteroviruses (EVs), adenoviruses (ADVs), human rhinoviruses (HRVs), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 swabs collected from children with acute upper respiratory tract infection were pooled into a single tube containing virus transport medium. patients with radiological pulmonary abnormalities, such as evidence of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, increased lung markings, dyspnea, or abnormal pulmonary breath sounds, were diagnosed with a LRTI. RT-PCR was performed using a superscript II one-step RT-PCR Platinum Taq kit. all products underwent electrophoresis in 2% agarose gel. clinical specimens Respiratory secretions were obtained from patients aged less than 14 years old with acute upper respiratory tract infection. patients with radiological pulmonary abnormalities, such as evidence of pneumonia, bronchopneumonia, increased lung markings, dyspnea, or abnormal pulmonary breath sounds, were diagnosed with LRTI. patients with clinical symptoms Cough 272 Fever 140 Asthma 61 Expectoration 10 laryngeal stridor 9 Vomiting 7 Diarrhea 5 Trembling 4 Chills 4 Headache 3 Gasping 3 Abdominal distension 3 Convulsions 3 Nasal discharge 2 Chest pain 2 2.3. PCR/RT-PCR Screening for Respiratory Viruses For all collected specimens, PCR or RT-PCRs were performed to detect infection 397 nasal and throat swabs were collected from outpatients and 323 bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens were collected from inpatients. in January 2010, seven bronchoalveolar lavage fluid specimens and 21 swabs were collected. overall, 402 out of 720 samples were found to be positive for at least one respiratory virus. the predominant subtype of influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus type B, and human parainfluenza virus type 3 accounted for higher percentage of the positive viral detections in both URTIs and LRTIs. the predominant subtype of influenza A, respiratory syncytial virus type B and human parainfluenza virus type 3 accounted for higher percentage of the positive viral detections in both URTIs and LRTIs. in URTIs, IFV first appeared in august 2009; its positivity rate was 70.83% in September 2009, which decreased to 27.78% in October. no IFV infection was observed in July 2009 or in May or June 2010. RVs were the third most common virus in URTIs and the most prevalent in LRTIs. no seasonality was observed for RVs in LRTIs. the prevalence of EV was similar in URTIs and LRTIs. ninety-nine patients were coinfected in total; 21 (5.29%) had URTIs and 68 (21.05%) had LRTIs. the pattern of coinfection was complex; 17 and 25 different combinations were found in URTIs and LRTIs, respectively.

HBoV was the most frequent viral pathogen to coinfect with LRTIs. the most prevalent viruses detected were RV (19.72%), PIV (17.78%), and IFV (13.9%). IFV, PIV, and RV were the most commonly detected viruses in URTIs.

IFV had a high prevalence during autumn and winter. in URTIs, its detection rate was 0.92%, and it occurred sporadically throughout the study. RV was the most prevalent virus, detected in 31.82% of children aged less than 6 months, 18.89% in children aged 3\u20136 years and 18.66% in children aged 6\u201314 years.

IFV infection was observed most commonly during autumn and winter [22], with no infections in May, July, or June. RV and PIV were the predominant viruses found in LRTIs, with a similar detection rate that was as high as 27%. these two viruses were also the most common in the URTI spectrum. the viral spectrum and positivity rate vary between regions and over time. HBoV was common in both upper and lower ARTIs in children. RSV and HBoV were found to be more prevalent in children aged less than 6 months. mixed respiratory virus infections are often seen in hospitalized children. infections increase the risk of acute otitis media in children with URTIs. a high frequency of HBoV was observed in combination with either S. mitis or group D streptococci. concurrent prevalence of viral-bacterial infections was also evident in other viruses, such as RV, PIV, and RSV."}
