{"summary": "a total of 18 patients confirmed with the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus from July 18 to July 30, 2009 were enrolled in this study. each patient underwent an evaluation to determine detailed clinical and radiological features. results All patients presented with high fever (> 38.0\u00b0C), with accompanying symptoms of cough, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia and diarrhea. all patients were young male soldiers with a mean age of 20 years. five of the 18 patients confirmed with the pandemic were from the same barrack. the other three patients were from different barracks and were admitted with suspected cases of rhabdomyolysis. hematological analysis of white blood cell count, red blood cell count, hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, platelet count, neutrophil count and biochemical analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), creatine kinase (CK), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were recorded. the presence of nodular opacity, consolidation (focal, multifocal, or bilateral) or interstitial patterns, distribution of findings including central (inner two-thirds of lung) or peripheral (outer one-third of lung) and upper, middle or lower lung zones, atelectasis, mediastinal abnormalities, and presence or absence of a pleural effusion were analyzed. all patients were young male soldiers with a mean age of 20 years. they visited the emergency department due to acute febrile respiratory illness from July 18 to July 20, 2009. the other three patients were from different barracks and were admitted with suspected cases of rhabdomyolysis after a long distance march. review of clinical and laboratory findings retrospectively reviewed. initial symptoms such as fever, cough, sputum, rhinorrhea, sore throat, myalgia, headache, dizziness, vomiting, and diarrhea were recorded. hematological analysis of the white blood cell count, red blood cell (RBC) count, hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, platelet count, neutrophil count and biochemical analysis of alkaline phosphatase (ALP), aspart s and thin-section CT images were reviewed by three experienced chest radiologists (8, 10 and 16 years of experience in chest radiology) the presence of nodular opacity, consolidation (focal, multifocal, or bilateral) or interstitial patterns, distribution of findings including central (inner two-thirds of lung) or peripheral (outer one-third of lung) and upper, middle or lower lung zones, atelectasis, mediastinal abnormalities, and the presence or the mean interval between symptom onset and the start of oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu\u00ae, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) administration was 3.9 1.6 days (range, 1 to 7 days) the mean interval between symptom onset and symptom improvement was 4.7 1.7 days (range, 2 to 8 days) no abnormality was noted for the RBC count, hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, platelet count, and neutrophil count. the AST or ALT was abnormal in three and one patient(s), respectively. CK was elevated in seven of 18 patients (39%). a laboratory analysis from the tracheal aspirate performed during endotracheal intubation confirmed the pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus infection. the patient's symptoms improved and was taken off mechanical ventilation five days after antiviral agent administration. only two patients showed abnormal findings of a small central nodular opacity in the right upper lung zone in one. on thin-section CT images, six of 12 patients (50%) showed abnormal findings. of these six patients, five (83%) had small GGOs; four had them in the upper lobe of the lung and one had a small GGO discovered in the lower lobe of the lung. two of the five patients also showed bilateral involvement. the mean interval between symptom onset and the start of oseltamivir phosphate (Tamiflu\u00ae, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) administration was 3.9 1.6 days (range, 1 to 7 days) the mean interval between symptom onset and symptom improvement was 4.7 1.7 days (range, 2 to 8 days). thrombocytopenia and lymphocytopenia were present in three of 18 (17%) and 12 of 18 patients (67%), respectively. no abnormality was noted for the RBC count, hemoglobin level, hematocrit level, platelet count, and neutrophil count. the patient was initially treated with antibiotics such as macrolide and a 3rd generation cephalosporin under suspicion of bacterial pneumonia. five days after contact with a patient with pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza viral infection, severe respiratory distress presented and a laboratory analysis from the tracheal aspirate performed during endotracheal intubation confirmed the pandemic. thin-section chest CT image shows consolidation in left middle and lower lung. consolidations are also suspected in right lower lung. six of 12 patients showed abnormal findings. GO = ground-glass opacity, LLL = left lower lobe, LUL = left upper lobe, No. = number, RLL = right lower lobe, RUL = right upper lobe, no. = number, GO = right lower lobe, no. = number, GO = right lower lobe, no. = number, GO = right lower lobe, no. = number, GO = right lower lobe, no. = number, 67% of patients showed lymphocytopenia and elevated CRP levels. this is consistent with those found in previous studies that dealt with unspecified populations. the most common CT abnormalities included small GGOs in five out of six patients and nodules in all six patients. the differences between the present study and previous studies could be attributed to the fact that radiological examinations were performed at the initial presentation, and probably the early stages of the disease. symptom onset and the emergency department visit were shorter. detection and treatment were made more promptly. however, an early diagnosis and early antiviral management can improve clinical course and outcome of the pandemic."}
