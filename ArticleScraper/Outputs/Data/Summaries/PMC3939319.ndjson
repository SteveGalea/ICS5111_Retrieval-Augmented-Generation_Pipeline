{"summary": "BTV is a prototype double-stranded RNA virus in the genus Orbivirus, family Reoviridae. it is one of the most important diseases of domestic livestock, including sheep, goat, cattle and other domestic animals. the exotic BTV serotype is an important animal pathogen listed in the \"USDA high Consequence Livestock Pathogens\" the NIH Molecular Libraries Small Molecule Repository (MLSMR) leads to the identification of six novel cluster of potential antiviral lead compound(s)5. the cytotoxicity of the antivirals, represented as the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) or the 50% effective concentration (EC50), is the concentration of a drug which inhibits virus-induced CPE halfway between the baseline and maximum. toA study is critical for determining the antiviral efficacy of a compound. each assay was validated and performed at least in triplicate with eight replicas. the data will be plotted using various biostatics and graphic tools2. CPE-based assay Using CTG Kit Seed BSR cells into a 384-well microplate (black; format by 16 x 24) via microFlo select dispenser. seeding density is 5,000 cells/well, and seeding volume is 20 l for antiviral efficacy analysis. cubate cells for 2-3 hr at 37 \u00b0C, with 5% CO2 and 80-95% humidity till cells are well attached to the plate. assign the first column as the positive control without adding compound and virus, and the last column (12th) as negative control by adding virus only without compounds. add 25 l/well of compound to column 2 and mixed 5x with 8-channel semi-automatic pipette to a concentration of 100 M. the final concentration at column 2 should be 100 M and the 12th column should be at 0.2 M. for the denoted -2 and -1 h.p.i., add the compound and BTV to the culture simultaneously. in these columns, add 5 l/well assay medium and 5 l/well diluted compound. after treatment, incubate cells at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2 with 80-95% humidity. this medium is referred as assay medium for all three assays. incubate all cells in the incubator at 37 \u00b0C, with 5% CO2 and 80-95% humidity. dose-response Assay Seed BSR cells into a 384-well microplate. incubate cells for 2-3 hr at 37 \u00b0C, with 5% CO2 and 80-95% humidity. assign first column as positive control without adding compound and virus. BTV-10, based on MOI of 0.01, to each well from column 2 to column 11 with a volume of 5 l/well. add 5 l of medium to column 1 as cell only control (positive) and 5 l/well of BTV to column 12 as cell only control (negative) assign column 1 as cells only control by adding 10 l/well assay medium to a final volume of 25 l/well. select the even-numbered columns from column 2-22 as antiviral efficacy evaluation column at different hours post infection (h.p.i.) the cell-based CPE assay was developed, optimized and validated in vitro using the luminescent-based CTG kit to identify novel antivirals against BTV. a number of potential antiviral compounds were evaluated, including compounds from each cluster identified via HTS against BTV5, and their derivatives via de novo synthesis2. the antiviral efficacy of C052 was evaluated in a 96-well scale within the 384-well plate. each treatment, including BTV infection plus different C052 concentrations, was performed with eight replicas. at 72 h.p.i., cell viability was determined using the CTG kit. cell viability was determined at 72 h.p.i using the CTG kit. each data point represents means and SD from five replicates. each data point represents means and SD from five replicates. the nanomolar scale antiviral efficacy, low toxicity, and consequently high SI50 indicated that C052 might act beyond the early stage of viral life-cycle, such as virus entry. the antiviral efficacies remained at the nanomolar scale (Figure 2)2. at 72 h.p.i., cell viability was determined using the CTG kit. each treatment, including BTV infection plus time of adding C052, was carried out with eight replicas. based screens are designed to provide a chemical starting point based on the most robust, simple and inexpensive assay. the CPE-based assay was designated to meet these requirements to identify effective hits from a large compound library. commercial reagents for CPE-based assay are available with a simple assay protocol. the dose-response assay was designated to further validate the antiviral efficacy of the hits identified via the single dose CPE-based assay. these hits, although identified with antiviral activity, need further confirmation to reveal their potentials to become a drug. out off-target or false positives will be identified, and the number of lead compounds could be narrowed down. directly screen for HIV-1 integrase inhibitors20, inhibiting virus binding to surface protein21 could be used which provide known MoA before actual screenings22. we have successfully screened and identified several potent antivirals against BTV, including C003 and C0522."}
