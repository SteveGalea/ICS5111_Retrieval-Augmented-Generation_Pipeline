{"summary": "members of the nAChR family contribute to essentially all aspects of the auditory sensory system function and development. this includes widespread changes in expression during embryogenesis that optimize their contribution to signal transduction, fine-tuning of sensory hair cells, and modulating central auditory circuit neurotransmission. nAChRs are composed of either homomeric (9) or heteromeric (9 + 10) subunits. this receptor is implicated in modifying longer lived stimulation by high-frequency sound. this receptor is implicated in modifying longer lived stimulation by high-frequency sound. alpha7-HA-IRES-tauGFP and alpha7-HA-IRES-Cre mice were used and housed in accordance with protocols approved in advance by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. this includes adherence to the Guide for the Care and use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institute of Health. nicotinic receptor 7 expression was modified using homologous recombination to add a C-terminus epitope tag (hemagglutinin [HA]) the 7 gene (Chrna7) was inserted into the 3\u2032 terminus of Chrna7 a reporter bicistronic internal ribosome entry sequence (IRES)-tau fusion to enhanced green fluorescent protein (eGFP) fusion protein cassette. Embryos were fixed in PBS/2% paraformaldehyde/5% sucrose, cryoprotected with sucrose in PBS to a final of 30%, embedded and sectioned using a microtome. the 12-m sections were mounted on glass slides, blocked, and permeabilized with 1% deoxycholate and 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS. images were collected using a microfire 24-bit CCD camera. ance, Princeton, New Jersey PRB-101P), anti-peripherin (rabbit; 1:100; Abcam, Cambridge, Massachusetts #1530), rabbit anti-beta-III tubulin (TUJ1; 1:3000; Covance MMS-435P). Detection of GFP offers superior sensitivity that is well over background fluorescence. the 7GFP mouse expresses the tauGFP protein as a marker of Chrna7 transcription. we crossed this mouse with the LoxP conditional diphtheria toxin (DTA) mouse lines. the 7 gene (Chrna7) was modified using homologous recombination. abbreviations are SG, spiral ganglion; and tg, trigeminal ganglion. examples of colabeling for 7GFP (green) and anti-HA (HA) in cells associated with the spiral ganglion at E16.5. the antibodies used were commercially obtained. they were anti-calcitonin gene-related protein (CGRP; rabbit; 1:30; Chemicon/Millipore, Temecula, Californa AB5920), anti-GFP (chicken; 1:800, Aves Labs, Tigard, Oregon GFP-1020), anti-HA (rabbit; 1:200; HA.11 Covance, Princeton, New Jersey PRB-101P), anti-peripher chlear structures was at E13.5 in cells of the spiral prominence (SP; Fig. 2B) 7GFP expression extends to cells in the sensory domain of the lesser epithelial ridge near the site of the presumptive outer hair cells (OHC) and Deiters' cells. light staining of the greater epithelium ridge was also present from E14.5 and thereafter. the expression of 7GFP identified by immunohistochemical detection of GFP (Methods) is shown for the embryonic cochlear structures in the sagittal section plane. an E14.5 cochlear structure shows the expression of 7GFP in the presumptive sensory region (sr) and pioneering efferents are also identified. postnatal day 6 (P6) 7GFP expression pattern reveals the SG afferents (arrow) that terminate as part of the extensive synaptic terminals at the base of the IHCs (arrow head) a Hensen's cell (H) is identified. in the SG, the expression of 7GFP is well established and the projections from these labeled cells can be followed to the vicinity of the inner hair cells (IHC) through E16.5, all otic structures exhibit a similar 7GFP expression pattern. this was not the case in the most basal structures successive developmental stages. all cochlear structures exhibit a similar pattern of 7GFP expression. also labeled are cells of the lesser epithelial ridge and presumptive sensory region. in the P12 cochlear structure, the branches were more abundant and form a \u2018feathered\u2019 structure that emanates from cell bodies defined by 7GFP expression. cells of the stria vascularis or other members of the cell family composing the structures of the lateral wall and surrounding cochlear duct were not observed to express 7GFP in these later stages of development. the prominently labeled efferent processes appear to form bundles upon entering the SG and then disperse into small solitary fibers (E14.5; Fig. 5.A and 2C,D) these solitary processes exhibit a beaded structure as they proceed to the base of the developing sensory cells (OHC) at the dorsal boarder of the Deiters' cells (D) the E18.5 embryo exhibits afferents detected by 7GFP expression (arrows) these extend from SG cells that are not colabeled with peripherin. at birth there are distinctly labeled 7GFP afferents (arrowhead) and peripherin-labeled efferents that extend to the Deiters' cells (D) and then turn (arrows) to contact the base of the OHCs. the origin of these efferent fibers was examined in serial sections of the hind brain. these cells appear to originate from a cell grouping in the basal brain stem caudal to trigeminal nucleus V that could be distinguished by their transient 7GFP expression. this is consistent with the reports of pioneering fibers that originate from the developing olive complex and extend to the developing cochlea. the expression of 7GFP was strongly detected in SG afferent fibers. the fibers terminate near or at the base of the IHCs. the other efferent fibers not detected by 7GFP continue to be trimmed. the earliest 7 expression we have defined is at P9.0 in rhombomeres 3 and 5. this was done using embryos from 7Cre mice crossed with mice harboring the conditional ROSA26-loxp. in these embryos, 7Cre:DTA-expressing cells and their direct lineages were ablated, thus revealing expression that could have been missed by 7GFP measurements. the cochlear structure is labeled for expression of the filament marker peripherin from an E16.5 7GFP mouse (A) and similarly timed 7Cre:DTA ablated embryo (B) arrow heads point to cochlear nerves and the asterisk identifies in A the cochlear ducts (asterisk in A) 7GFP expression reveals the strongly labeled cells of the ventral-posterior cochlear nucleus (VCP) the dorsal cochlear nucleus (DC) and ventral-anterior cochlear nucleus (VCA) cells clusters expressing 7GFP (arrowhead) and individual cells to express a7 (arrow) are noted. another P12 sagittal section reveals 7GFP expression in the ascending central auditory pathways. the expression of 7GFP persists into the adult animal. efferents follow the brachium of the inferior colliculus to the medial geniculate nucleus where scattered cells expressing 7GFP were seen. lear structure where loss of 7GFP expression by OHC and Deiters' cells was first observed in the most basal structures successive developmental stages. this generates a striking contrast in 7GFP expression between cochlear structures at the apex relative to the base with intermediary turns. this gradient was not evident (not shown) and the mature 7GFP expression pattern first observed in the E18.5 basal cochlear structures was present across the entire structure. nonsensory cells of the cochlear structure express 7GFP. strongest labeling of cochlear structures was restricted to cells of the SG. asterisks identify autofluorescence in the tectorial membrane. lion (SG) cells terminate (arrow head) at the base of the inner cell. sagittal section shows a group of efferent processes (arrow) that distribute to solitary fibers that are strongly labeled for 7GFP expression. the e18.5 embryo exhibits afferents detected by 7GFP expression. these extend from SG cells that are not colabeled with peripherin. at birth there are distinctly labeled 7GFP afferents (arrowhead) and peripherin-labeled efferents that extend to the Deiters' cells (D) and then turn (arrows) to contact the base of the OHCs. the 7GFP identify mostly processes reaching the IHCs. arrows identify the 7GFP-expressing afferent ending at the base of nonlabeled IHC. other peripherin processes extend to the base of the IHCs. these cells suggest that these cells are within the forming olive complex. these fibers were not detected after E15.5. there was essentially no labeling of neuronal processes by 7GFP. however, ongoing innervation of cochlear sensory cells was identified. processes originating from SG cells identified by peripherin expression form distinct efferent terminals on or near OHCs cells. no 7GFP labeling of olivocochlear efferents was detected. earliest 7 expression we have defined is at P9.0 in rhombomeres 3 and 5. we used peripherin expression to aid in examining the fate of non-7-expressing cells. the overall patterning of the cochlear structure and the formation of major boney structures were intact, although somewhat distorted. the cochlear ducts were collapsed (Fig. 6B), probably due to the absence or severe thinning of the distal lateral wall. the SG of 7Cre:DTA embryos is reduced in size. the majority of cells remaining give rise to mostly peripherin-labeled efferents. these fibers appear to be more densely aggregated relative to the 7GFP control mouse. the cochlear nucleus (C) and the eighth cranial nerve (8n) are visible as is the fifth cranial nerve (5n), the trigeminal nucleus (TGN) and trigeminal ganglion (TGG) also noted are cochlear ducts (asterisk) and a spiral ganglion (SG). expression of 7GFP appears to intensify after P10, and by P12 signal is consolidated almost exclusively in the ventral-posterior cochlear nucleus. no expression of 7GFP was detected in the dorsal cochlear nucleus, although some dispersed and weakly stained cells were present in the granular aspect. efferents follow the brachium of the inferior colliculus to the medial geniculate nucleus where scattered cells expressing 7GFP were seen. labeling of olivocochlear fibers was not detected. 7GFP is not detected in IHCs, which is consistent with 9 nAChR being the principle target of alpha-bungarotoxin in this cell type. this suggests that functional redundancy between these receptor subtypes is unlikely (see also Rogers and Gahring 2012). the association of certain auditory deficits and nicotine abuse, mostly associated with cigarette smoking, has further focused speculation on the role of 7 in these pathologies. this study also adds the possibility of an effect by 7 on the performance of the spiral ligament. the role of 7 has, to our knowledge, not been examined in these cells. the potential for 7 functional pleiotropy in the auditory system is similar to other tissues we have recently examined (Rogers and Gahring 2012)."}
