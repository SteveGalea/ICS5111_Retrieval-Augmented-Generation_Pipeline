{"summary": "non-cytotoxic, crude ethanol extracts of Rhodiola rosea roots, Nigella sativa seeds, and Sambucus nigra fruit were tested for anti-IBV activity. cytotoxicity curves on vero cells using trypan blue staining determined the highest non-cytotoxic concentrations of each plant extract. studies using S. nigra extract to treat or prevent IBV are warranted. gamma-coronavirus infects the respiratory tract of chickens and causes production of eggs with deformed and weakened shells. some commonalities include the use of similar pathogen recognition receptors and MAP-kinase signaling pathways to upregulate cellular immune responses. the secondary metabolites used by plants for their own defense have been effective inhibitors, in some cases, of animal infectious agents. the use of these extracts or the active ingredients from these extracts poses some toxicity concerns. these concerns, combined with the difficulties often encountered when translating in vitro research into in vivo treatments, suggest that in vitro identification of a number of different antiviral plants is important. nigra extract has successfully inhibited influenza A and B viruses in vitro and in vivo. antiviral compound quercetin is also present in both S. nigra and in Amelanchier alnifolia (Saskatoon serviceberry) [43], a known inhibitor of the bovine coronavirus, in vitro. the previously described Vero-adapted Beaudette strain of IBV [45] was used in all IBV infection experiments. infections and titers were performed with Vero cells. 0.04% ethanol for R. rosea extract treatments, 0.2% ethanol for N. sativa extract treatments, and 0.4% ethanol for S. nigra extract treatments. at 48 h post-treatment, supernatants containing dead cells were collected and combined with adherent cells. cells were transferred to fresh DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. cells were then incubated in solvent alone for 20 min prior to infection. cytopathic effect was then assessed visually using light microscopy. titers were quantified via plaque assay. first, serial dilutions of virus were absorbed to confluent Vero cells for 1 h in a small amount of serum free DMEM. agarose overlay containing 0.015% neutral red was added to cells. 24 h later, clear plaques were counted and virus titers were calculated. samples were examined on a Hitachi 7600 transmission electron microscope under 80 kV. micrographs were collected using a software controlling an AMT ER50 5 megapixel CCD camera. no human or animal subjects were used. extract solutions were centrifuged at 1900 g for 5 min at room temperature. remaining supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 m polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. cells were plated in 35-mm dishes in duplicate for approximately 1 d before being treated with plant extracts for 48 h. cells were plated in 35-mm dishes for approximately 2 d before being treated with 3.75 10-4 g/ml of N. sativa extract, 1.5 10-4 g/ml of R. rosea extract, or 4.0 10-3 g/ml of S. nigra extract for 24 h. virus was incubated with these same concentrations of plant extract (or solvent alone) for 20 min at room temperature. infections were done at an MOI of 0.1, except exposure to solvent alone was substituted for exposure to S. nigra extract if a specific treatment was omitted. cells were incubated with 4 mg/ml of S. nigra extract for 24 h prior to infection. agarose overlay containing 0.015% neutral red (MP Biomedicals, LLC, Solon, OH) was added to cells. purified virus was collected from the 20%-55% sucrose interface. pelleted for 2 h at 55 k RPM in an SW 28 tube. pellets were resuspended in 40\u201360 l TNE and kept on ice. for all plant extracts, the number of live cells decreased with increasing concentrations of extract in a dose-responsive manner. the highest concentration of plant extract that did not significantly decrease the number of live cells, relative to controls, was used for all subsequent antiviral screening. S. nigra extract-treated cells showed no detectable CPE at an MOI of 0.1 and a reduction of virus titers by six orders of magnitude. this inhibition was still large, reducing viral titers by approximately four orders of magnitude, relative to solvent-treated samples. S. nigra extracts inhibit IBV at an early step in the infection process. the pre-V treatment resulted in a titer reduction of over three orders of magnitude in the cells and over four orders of magnitude in the supernatants. combining pre-V treatment with post treatment worked together to fully inhibit IBV replication. the pre-C treatment was not necessary for full virus inhibition, nor did it impact the viral titer of the supernatant. however, it did work synergistically with pre-V treatment to reduce viral titers in the cells an additional three orders of magnitude. virions with uncompromised envelopes and characteristic spike protein profiles were easily identified in solvent treated samples. treatment of the virus with S. nigra extract resulted exclusively in virions with damaged envelopes. the profiles of the spike proteins appeared unaffected in the treated samples, but the membranous envelope appeared to have been compromised. cytotoxicity assays with trypan blue staining were performed. cells were treated for 48 h with the indicated concentration of extract. the number of live cells decreased with increasing concentrations of extract in a dose-responsive manner. titers of the N. sativa extract-treated supernatants and cells were not significantly different from controls. unexpectedly, R. rosea extract-treated cells showed no detectable CPE at an MOI of 0.1. on the other hand, S. nigra extract-treated cells showed no detectable CPE at an MOI of 0.1. S. nigra extracts inhibit IBV at an early step in the infection process. pre-treatment of IBV with S. nigra extracts dramatically reduces viral titers. cells and virus were treated at an MOI of 1. independent infections with IBV were performed three times, with two replicates per assay. results from these experiments revealed that combining pre-V treatment with post treatment worked together to fully inhibit IBV replication. independent infections with IBV were performed three times. virions with uncompromised envelopes and characteristic spike protein profiles were easily identified in solvent treated samples. only S. nigra extracts inhibited viral replication, reducing viral titers by four to six orders of magnitude in a dose-dependent manner. only S. nigra extracts inhibited viral replication, reducing viral titers by four to six orders of magnitude. S. nigra extract has been shown to inactivate two enveloped viruses. the membranes of these two viruses are chemically distinct. lectins are commonly found in plant extracts and often show antiviral activity by binding to viral proteins. many of their phytochemicals are thought to be antiviral. nigra is also rich in cyanidin, kaempferol, myricetin, dihydromyricetin, and quercetin derivatives. s (5,7,3\u2019,4\u2019-tetra-O-methylquercetin and 5,7-dihydroxy-4-oxo-2-(3,4,5-trihydroxyphenyl)chroman-3-yl-3,4,5-trihydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate) are found in S. nigra and not in R. rosea or N. sativa. a currently unidentified chemical or combination of chemicals may be responsible for the ability of virions that survive the pre-treatment intact would be competent for infection, and their progeny would face no further challenge from the extract in the absence of post-infection treatment. testing of S. nigra extract fractions will help explore this possibility. vaccination is the main method for inhibiting IBV in poultry populations. its effectiveness on new strains is often minimal, leading to outbreaks in even vaccinated populations. glycyrrhizin, the active chemical from G. radix extracts, inhibited IBV. authors\u2019 contributions CC participated in the design of the S. nigra portion of the study, carried out most of the S. nigra experiments, drafted substantial portions of the manuscript, and helped prepare the final manuscript.
