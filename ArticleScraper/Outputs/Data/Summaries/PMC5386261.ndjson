{"summary": "the length of the CDV genome is 15,690 nucleotides (nt) it possesses a single-stranded negative RNA encoding six nonoverlapping transcriptional units producing eight proteins. the viral polymerase (L) protein and its cofactor phosphoprotein (P) constitute the ribonucleoprotein (RNP) [3], which directs the sequential synthesis of capped and polyadenylated mRNAs from six transcriptional units. genome of CDV encodes the genes for the following components: matrix (M = 1008 bp), fusion (F = 1989 bp), hemagglutinin (H = 1824 bp), nucleocapsid (N = 1572 bp), polymerase (L = 6555 bp), and phosphoprotein (P = 1524 bp). recombination could serve as a critical process for the evolution of RNA viruses. raccoon USA 1998 EU716337 164071 Canis familiaris USA 2004 AB687721 CYN07-hV Macaca fascicularis Japan 2008 JN896987 VR-1587 NA USA NA AY649446 01\u20132689 raccoon USA 2001 AY386315 5804 NA USA NA AY386316 5804P NA USA NA AY649446 01\u20132689 raccoon USA 2001 AY386315 5804 NA USA modelTest v3.7 [11], PAUP* v4b10 (Swofford, 2003), and MrBayes v3.1.1 explored the distance (neighbor-joining) and characteristics [Bayesian, maximum likelihood (ML)-based phylogenetic methods] of the nucleotides sequences. results of the analysis were confirmed using Bayesian and ML approaches with the MEGA 5.0 software package. single-likelihood ancestor counting (SLAC), fixed-effects likelihood (FEL), internal fixed-effects likelihood (IFEL) and random effects likelihood (REL) were implemented in the Datamonkey web server. the significance levels were set at p = 0.1, p = 0.1, p = 0.1, respectively. seven transversional models with a proportion of invariable sites and a substitution model comprised of gamma-shaped distribution of rates across these sites. the gene sequences mentioned above were trimmed by MEGA V5.0 [10] the results of the analysis were confirmed using the MEGA 5.0 software package. the phylogenetic tree was tested by bootstrapping with 1000 replicates. the phocine distemper virus (PDV) was indicated as an outgroup in the models. significance levels were set at p = 0.1, p = 0.1, p = 0.1, respectively.

RNA viruses are genetically flexible. the nucleotide substitutions occur at high frequencies to allow rapid adaptation to various selection pressures. no previous studies suggested whether these six individual genes were under negative or positive selection.
