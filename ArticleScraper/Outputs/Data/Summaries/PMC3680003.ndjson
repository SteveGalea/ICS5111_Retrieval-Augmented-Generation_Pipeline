{"summary": "a core functions framework was developed, identifying 21 core public health programs. for each core program, an evidence review was conducted and a model core program paper developed. the CF implementation was conceptualized as an embedded knowledge translation process. in the early 21st century, several public health emergencies highlighted the need for public health reform. in the early 21st century, several public health emergencies highlighted the need for public health reform. the centerpiece of the province of British Columbia\u2019s approach to reform is a Framework for core functions in public health (CF Framework) [6]. KT is a process of closing the gap between the evidence generated in research and its application for frontline health systems delivery. KT is a process of closing the gap between the evidence generated in research and its application for frontline health systems delivery. a provincial steering committee was created to develop, oversee, and guide the CF framework implementation. the committee commissioned and approved evidence reviews for each of the core programs. if the HA was already implementing some of the best practices described in the MCPPs, they could continue to offer those services. greenhalgh et al.'s framework on the diffusion of innovations in health service organizations is beyond the scope of this paper and will be presented in subsequent publications. implementation and knowledge translation Implementation has been generally studied as a component of a larger change process, such as the diffusion of innovations. KT is a process of closing the gap between evidence generated in research and its application for frontline health systems delivery [19]. KT is a process of closing the gap between the evidence generated in research and its application for frontline health systems delivery [19], but we do not know how the use of implementation frameworks might improve the process. public health services represent only a small part of services provided by HAs. but they were not the major focus of the GLE. a key representative within each HA extended an invitation to participate. data collection questions were based on sensitizing concepts from Greenhalgh et al.\u2019s framework. topics included knowledge about the CF Framework, how evidence informed practice, integration of an equity lens into STIP/HL activities. similar interview guides were used for both interviews and focus groups. coding framework evolved as analysis progressed, facilitated by regular team meetings to discuss and agree on emerging themes. the themes described below have been presented to and discussed with HA team members and research participants in several venues. data collection was conducted in-person (five interviews, six focus groups) or by teleconference (14 interviews, two focus groups) based on HA preference. a review of interview and focus group data suggest that the data were similar in depth and scope. however, individual focus group responses were shorter than interview responses. the public health renewal process was collaborative involving representatives from government, HAs, and other stakeholders. the government acted in a stewardship role, responsible for overseeing but not directing the process. HAs were asked to conduct gap analyses and develop PIPs for each of the core programs, using the evidence reviews and MCPPs. participants raised questions such as: \u2018is my staff responsible for this\" What are common indicators across the region and province and shouldn\u2019t we be working towards these\" some of the activities that we do, cross into other core programs, so how do we deal with that' most HAs responded by clustering core programs into related groups. in one HA, infant and child health was bundled with reproductive health. others clustered programs into age-related groups. many felt that public health was being unfairly targeted for budget cuts. many felt that public health, in particular, was being unfairly targeted for budget cuts. some respondents sought direction regarding which of the 21 programs were a priority within the HA, but did not find much guidance. the framework meant starting from scratch and implementing a new program. some staff questioned the intent of core functions because to them CF implementation meant that the good work they were already doing was not being acknowledged. some participants did recognize that the intention was about making sure the gaps were covered and, if necessary, services were enhanced. others did not believe that others understood this, as reflected below. participants said that everything associated with the CF Framework fell to the bottom of the list. this was because they perceived no consequences from the Ministry for non-implementation and that ongoing resources beyond the initial funding were not provided either by the Ministry or the HAs. participants believed there needed to be strong leadership at all levels in the organization, not only in supporting CF implementation, but also in advocating for the role of public health within the HA. one participant summed this up well: 'i think that the leadership style needs to be collaborative and inclusive' the public health renewal process was collaborative involving representatives from government, HAs, and other stakeholders. the government acted in a stewardship role, responsible for overseeing but not directing the process. many claimed not to have a clear understanding of the vision, intent, or meaning of the Framework or the implementation process. participants raised questions such as: \u2018is my staff responsible for this\" What are common indicators across the region and province and shouldn\u2019t we be working towards these\" How are other HAs doing this?\u2019. they perceived a lack of guidance in answering their questions. most HAs responded by clustering core programs into related groups. infant and child health was bundled with reproductive health, while HL and healthy communities were clustered with mental health promotion and preventing the harms of substance use. a mismatch between the stated intentions of the Ministry and the means for implementing public health renewal put managers in a double bind. many felt that public health, in particular, was being unfairly targeted for budget cuts. people in HAs were awaiting a government announcement on the HL core program. the 'change fatigue' they reported was a significant barrier to implementation. the implementation of some core programs was put on hold. some staff questioned the intent of core functions because to them CF implementation meant that the good work they were already doing was not being acknowledged. some participants did recognize that the intention was about making sure the gaps were covered and, if necessary, services were enhanced. others did not believe that others understood this, as reflected below. participants said that everything associated with the CF Framework fell to the bottom of the list. this was because they perceived no consequences from the Ministry for non-implementation and that ongoing resources beyond the initial funding were not provided either by the Ministry or the HAs. participants said that the political will within the CF Framework was not always there. participants believed there needed to be strong leadership at all levels in the organization, not only in supporting CF implementation, but also in advocating for the role of public health within the HA. one participant summed this up well: 'the leadership style needs to be collaborative and inclusive and then what I mean by that is reaching out to other programs outside of public health' a subset of data gathered during phase two (interviews with senior executives in the HAs) and phase three (follow-up interviews with front line staff and managers) may reveal that influences may change as the implementation process evolves over time. a similarity of the MCPPs to what was already going on led some participants to dismiss the MCPPs as redundant. the perceived complexity of an intervention will negatively influence implementation. participants talked about instability in the external environment created by significant organizational restructuring in some HAs. a provincial election that put CF implementation on hold, and the H1N1 pandemic that diverted both the resources and the practice of public health away from CF implementation. in the inner context, influences on implementation include: system antecedents for innovation; and system readiness for innovation. key components of this context include strong leadership and a clear and strategic vision. many participants perceived a lack of strong public health leadership within the organization. lack of resources to implement core functions adequately was seen by participants as a concrete reflection of the lack of leadership to advocate for the role of public health. participants believed they were already engaged in best practices outlined in the MCPPs. this suggests that there was already a good innovation-system fit. a shared perception of the importance of the intervention\u2019s implementation within the organization predicts implementation effectiveness. greenhalgh et al.\u2019s framework identifies leadership and management factors as important in enhancing implementation. participants suggested that the goals of upper level management in the HAs do not align with the goals of public health or the CF Framework. some participants believe this is because of public health\u2019s marginal position in the larger healthcare system. the CF Framework was implemented in a complex, dynamic environment that presented significant challenges. the lack of consequences for the HAs in not implementing the programs reinforced this. there appeared to be no opportunities for staff and managers to consult on, or participate in developing a shared vision for the Framework. evaluation is essential to determine whether the prospective use of an implementation framework will influence successful implementation. there must be sufficient resources, not just for the activities of the intervention, but also to support the implementation process. the return on this investment is likely to be substantial. participants identified few incentives in support of implementation. there was limited accountability for action, no perceived consequences for lack of implementation, and no funding to support implementation. devolved decision making in the organization to teams on the ground contributes to successful implementation [30]. front line staff, in particular, did not believe they had decision making authority in this regard. public health budgets could never be raided by the acute care system. leadership may be important to push staff 'to break out of the convergent thinking and routines that are the norm in large organizations' tension for change is the extent to which those involved perceive the current situation as intolerable or requiring change. participants made it clear that they did not perceive core program implementation as a priority in the organization relative to competing priorities. support for teamwork is therefore important to facilitate the development of shared meaning, values, and vision in regard to the innovation. participants suggested that the goals of upper level management in the HAs do not align with the goals of public health or the CF Framework. some participants believe this is because of public health\u2019s marginal position in the larger healthcare system or because of the lack of a public health voice at the executive table. there were no implementation plans developed at the health authority level for such a major intervention. there appeared to be no opportunities for staff and managers to consult on, or participate in developing a shared vision for the CF Framework. the lesson to be learned is implementation is the Achilles heel of innovation. MM and BP participated in the data analysis, contributed to writing and editing sections of the paper. TH led development of the CF Framework, contributed to the discussion section, and to editing and approving the final version."}
