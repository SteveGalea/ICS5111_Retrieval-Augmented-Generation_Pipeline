{"summary": "as of 4 July 2014, there have been 827 confirmed cases of infection with MERS-CoV. cases have been linked to many regions of Asia, Africa, Europe, and America. patients with a mild respiratory illness may be infected with MERS-CoV. acid type I membrane glycoprotein, is known to be responsible for receptor binding (9,15,19,22), membrane fusion (9a) and induction of neutralising antibodies (7\u20139,18) it shares common structural features with the S proteins of other CoVs (11,15,22,23a) it contains the receptor-binding domain (RBD) (7\u20139,15,18), and S2 which contains the fusion peptide (9a). the antisera were then tested in terms of their ability to bind S protein derived from the transfection of the codon-optimized S gene and their ability to neutralize MERS-CoV using an in vitro neutralizing assay. a novel neutralizing epitope corresponding to amino-acid residues 736\u2013761 of the S protein was also identified. the amino-acid sequence of the MERS-CoV S protein was downloaded from NCBI GenBank. immunogenic regions containing potential human B-cell epitopes were predicted using bepiPred and ABCPred B. 367\u2013606 aa of S Anti-RBD (EMC), from mice 2 RBD (SARS-CoV) 318\u2013510 aa of S Anti-SARS (W624), from mice 3 P24 (HIV-1) Anti P24, from mice 4 SP2-1 (MERS-CoV) coupled to KLH; 509\u2013530 aa of S Anti SP2, from rabbit SP2-2 (MERS-CoV) coupled to KLH 529\u2013554 incomplete Freund's adjuvant (Sigma) was immunized thrice at 3-week intervals. mice were monitored for seroconversion to the rRBD using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) was used to detect nCoV S glycoprotein expression in BHK cells. cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline, and then probed with indicated primary antibodies for another 1 h. the LV-CoVpps were harvested at 48 h post-transfection. the virus titer (presented as the HIV p24 antigen concentration) was determined using the Vironostika HIV-1 Antigen Microelisa System (BioM\u00e9rieux) to map the entry steps targeted by the polyclonal antisera. experimental and control groups were evaluated by a one-way analysis of variance using SPSS software. differences were considered significant at p0.05. cell lines and plasmids BHK-21, Huh-7, and 293FT were cultured in modified Eagle's medium. es was synthesized with a cysteine residue added to the C terminal. the peptides were dissolved in 5% dimethyl sulfoxide at 2 mg/mL. all peptides were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy to verify their identity. rabbit rRBD was prepared based on the coding sequence of MERS-CoV RBD (GenBank accession number: JX869059; spike residues 367\u2013606) the purified RBD of SARS-CoV was used for mouse immunization as a control. one milligram of each of the S peptides was mixed with an equal volume of CFA and used as the formulation for immunization. the rabbits were given triple booster injections at 3 weeks after the initial immunization. cells cultured on coverslips were fixed in 4% formaldehyde, permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100, blocked in 5% bovine serum albumin in phosphate-buffered saline. after a wash, cells were incubated with their respective Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated secondary antibodies for another 1 h. luciferase reporter gene was incubated with LV-CoVpps at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. the antibody was added after the binding of LV-CoVpp to the target cells. the antibody was added after the binding of LV-CoVpp to the target cells. the antisera against the SP2 peptides in immunized mice showed a very high binding capacity with the RBD of MERS-CoV. no cross-reactivity was observed between the antisera against the RBD of MERS-CoV and the RBD of SARS-CoV. eptad repeat 2 (residues 1252\u20131286); TM, transmembrane domain (residues 1296\u20131353); rRBD, recombinant RBD from the Bac-to-Bac system (indicated by a gray box) the S peptides used in this study were SP2-1 (residues 509\u2013530), SP2-2 (residues 529\u2013554), pVRC-SY (nCoV)-transfected 293FT cells were transfected with pVRC-SY(nCoV) 30 hours later, cell lysates were prepared and Western blots were performed by using the indicated antiserum. asterisks indicate the correct bands of S protein. N-peptide immunization in rabbits was used for Western blotting. but no specific band was observed. this result indicates that all antibodies raised against the rRBD and S peptides bound specifically to the native form of MERS-CoV S. a confocal IFA was used to analyze S expression in BHK cells transfected with pVRC-SY. rRBD elicited robust neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV in mice. the rabbit antiserum against SP2 did not show neutralizing activity. a CD analysis of the SP2-1 and -2 peptides showed that they were linear. antiserum (W624) from the SARS-CoV RBD effectively neutralized an MERSpp infection in vitro, while it did not neutralize an MERSpp infection. the neutralizing antibodies induced by the rRBD and SP3 of MERS-CoV were specific and did not cross-neutralize SARS-CoV. antisera were added after MERSpp binding to target cells in Protocol II. rRBD and panel of peptides were used as antigens to raise polyclonal antibodies in mice and rabbits. the codon-optimized full-length S coding gene was inserted into the expression vector pVRC. SP, signal peptide (residues 1\u201318); RBD, receptor-binding domain (residues 367\u2013606); 751\", S1/S2 cleavage site; HR1, heptad repeat 1 (residues 992\u20131054); HR2, heptad repeat 2 (resi expression of the MERS-CoV S protein in 293FT and BHK cells was confirmed by Western blotting and IFA using antisera against the immunogens used in this study. samples were derived from 293FT or BHK cells transfected with pVRC-SY or pVRC8304 (indicated as Mock) 130\u2013170 kDa were detected by the anti-RBD and anti-SP sera. the antiserum from N-peptide immunization in rabbits was used for Western blotting, but no specific band was observed. this result indicates that all antibodies raised against the rRBD and S peptides bound specifically to the native S protein. MERS-CoVpp was premixed 1:1 with the indicated dilution of antisera. only the antiserum from rabbits injected with SP3 showed neutralizing activity. titer of NT50 reached 50% neutralization at a 1:100 dilution. the antiserum against the rRBD and SP3 of MERS-CoV effectively neutralized an MERSpp infection in vitro, while it did not neutralize an MERSpp infection. the neutralizing antibodies induced by the rRBD and SP3 of MERS-CoV were specific and did not cross-neutralize SARS-CoV. anti-RBD and -SP3 neutralizing antibodies inhibited MERSpp entry. the experiment was performed as described in Materials and Methods. a representative experiment performed in triplicate is shown. an ELISA-based analysis of the serum IgG responses against the immunogens revealed that the RBD was more immunogenic in BALB/c mice than were the peptide-KLH conjugates in rabbits. western blotting and confocal IFA indicated that the antiserum might bind most efficiently to the MERS-CoV S protein expressed in the cytoplasm and on the membrane. residues 509\u2013554 of the S are located at the binding interface of the RBD according to recent crystallization data (15,23a) this is the first linear neutralizing epitope located outside of the RBD in the S protein of MERS-CoV. this is the first linear neutralizing epitope located outside of the RBD in the S protein of MERS-CoV. amino-acid residues 736\u2013761 of the S protein carried neutralizing epitopes that may be used to develop vaccines and antiviral agents against MERS-CoV. authors thank Dr Yuxian He (Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences) for providing rRBD protein of SARS-CoV."}
