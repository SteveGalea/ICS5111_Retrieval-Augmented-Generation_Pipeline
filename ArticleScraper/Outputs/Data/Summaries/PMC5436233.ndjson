{"summary": "mechanical ventilation may induce and exacerbate lung injury. biomarkers of ventilator-associated lung injury (VALI) are important for early diagnosis and prognosis. the precise function of each mediator remains to be elucidated. NGAL is easily detected in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid (10,11) results indicated that NGAL levels increase in lung tissue, BAL fluid and serum during VALI in mice. NGAL may represent a novel diagnostic marker for the early prediction of patients at high risk of VALI. the protocol for low-volume for 2 h (LV-2) group was breathing under the condition of 6 ml/kg, 5 cm H2O PEEP for 2 h at 135 breaths/min. the protocol for high-volume for 4 h (LV-4) group was breathing under the condition of 6 ml/kg, 0 cm H2O PEEP for 4 h at 65 breaths/min. serum was collected via centrifugation at 1,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. Immediately post-mortem, the heart-lung block was dissected. RT-qPCR Total RNA was extracted from frozen lung samples using TRIzol reagent. a total of 1 g total RNA was reverse-transcribed to cDNA using the AffinityScript QPCR cDNA Synthesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) RT-qPCR was performed using the Brilliant II SYBR-Green QPCR Master Mix kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) bands were detected using anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. densitometric analysis was performed using QuantityOne software version 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) immunohistochemical staining of NGAL Following deparaffinization and dehydration, sections were immersed in 10 mM sodium citrate buffer (pH 6.0) with 0.05% Tween-20, for 5 min at 58\u00b0C, and subsequently treated with 0.25% Triton X-100 for 5 min. slides were incubated at 4\u00b0C with a rabbit anti-rat biotin-conjugated IgG H&L secondary antibody. the mice were housed in a laminar flow cabinet and maintained on standard laboratory food ad libitum. the study was approved by the ethics committee of the university of traditional Chinese medicine. the protocol for the control group was spontaneous breathing for 2 h. the experimental protocols for each group are detailed in Table I. main group Subgroup Protocols Control Control Spontaneous breathing for 2 h Ventilation for 2 h group High-PIP (n=6) 50 cm H2O of PIP and 2.5 cm H2O PEEP at 17 breaths/min for 2 h with tidal volume of 1 ml Low-PIP (n=6) 15 cm H2O of PIP and 0 cm H2O PEEP for 2 fluid was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. the supernatant was collected for western blotting. the right lung was cut into samples (11 cm) and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. the vertical axis of each left lung was identified. PCR reactions were performed on an iQ5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection system (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA) gene expression was measured in triplicate, quantified using the 2Cq method (15) and normalized to the -actin internal control. ish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (7076; 1:2,000; Cell Signaling Technology, Inc.) at 37\u00b0C for 40 min followed by treatment with SuperSignal\u00ae West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Kodak, Rochester, NY, USA) densitometric analysis was performed using QuantityOne software version 4.6.2 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) NGAL antibody (MAB1857; 1:100; R&D Systems, Inc.) overnight. slides were incubated with a rabbit anti-rat biotin-conjugated IgG H&L secondary antibody. Statistical analysis All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS software. the protocol for low peak inflation pressure (low-PIP) group was breathing under the condition of 15 cm H2O of PIP and 0 cm H2O PEEP for 2 h at 120 breaths/min with a tidal volume of 0.29 ml. the protocol for high-volume for 2 h (LV-2) group was breathing under the condition of 30 ml/kg, 0 cm H2O PEEP for 2 h at 65 breaths/min. /min LV2 (n=6) 6 ml/kg, 5 cm H2O PEEP for 2 h at 135 breaths/min Ventilation for 4 h group HV4 (n=6) 30 ml/kg, 0 cm H2O PEEP for 4 h at 135 breaths/min High-PIP, high peak inflation pressure; low-PIP, low peak inflation pressure; PEEP, positive end-expiratory pressure; LV, low-volume RNA was quantified by measuring absorption at wavelengths of 260 and 280 nm using the nanoDrop system (NanoDrop; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Wilmington, DE, USA) and stored at 70\u00b0C until required. RT-qPCR was performed using the Brilliant II SYBR-Green QPCR Master Mix kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, CA, USA) protein concentration was determined using the Bicinchoninic Acid Protein Assay kit. total proteins (30 g) were separated by 8\u201312% SDS-PAGE at 120 V. blots were probed with mouse monoclonal anti--actin. the ratio of target protein from the control group was arbitrarily set to 1. H&E staining Lung samples were fixed in 10% formalin solution at 4\u00b0C for 24 h. samples were wax embedded and cut into 4\u20136 m sections on a microtome. Statistical differences between two groups were determined using the unpaired Student's t-test. P0.05 was considered to indicate a statistically significant difference. results Different modalities of mechanical ventilation affect the extent of lung injury. RT-qPCR demonstrated that NGAL expression in lung tissue was increased in all groups compared with the control group. mRNA and protein expression levels of NGAL in groups treated with different mechanical ventilation protocols. protein expression profiles of NGAL in BAL fluid and serum were similar to those in lung tissue. NGAL (A) mRNA and (B) protein expression levels were expressed as the mean standard deviation. localization of NGAL expression in murine lungs was performed. the control, LV2, LV4 and low-PIP groups showed an abnormal histology compared with the control group. these abnormalities included alveolar septal thickening indicative of edema formation, mononuclear cell infiltration of the alveolar walls, hemorrhage, fibrin exudation and intra-alveolar erythrocyte infiltration. NGAL protein expression levels increased in all groups compared with control group. mRNA and protein expression levels of NGAL in groups treated with different mechanical ventilation protocols. NGAL (A) mRNA expression levels expressed as the mean standard deviation. mRNA and (B) protein expression levels expressed as the mean standard deviation.

NGAL (A) mRNA (B) protein expression levels expressed as the mean standard deviation. NGAL expression increase is time-dependent under high-volume mechanical ventilation treatment. localization of NGAL expression in murine lungs was performed.
