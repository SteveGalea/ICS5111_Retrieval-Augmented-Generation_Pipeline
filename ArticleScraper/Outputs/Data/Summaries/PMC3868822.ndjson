{"summary": "the complex aid debate continues on and is becoming increasingly polarised. the european commissioner for research and innovation signed an agreement with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. despite cuts in other areas of the EU budget, the budget has remained intact. bio\u2013manguinhos will develop affordable combined measles and rubella vaccine. measles is a leading cause of children under five in these countries. the combined vaccine currently has limited availability. rotavirus vaccinations are expensive to produce, transport and store, carry higher risks of intestinal blockages, and are unsuitable for newborn babies. a major initiative to eliminate measles outbreaks in the DR Congo started in September 2013. aim is to vaccinate 6.8 million children aged from six months to nine years in two of the country\u2019s provinces. pentavalent vaccine combines vaccinations for diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, hepatitis B and haemophilus influenza type b (Hib, causing meningitis, pneumonia and otitis) it will reduce the number of injections needed from nine to three. globally, hib is the second most common cause of bacterial pneumonia deaths. the world bank's doing business annual survey measures the costs to companies of business regulations in each of the 183 countries surveyed. there is controversy over the Bank\u2019s methodology and its focus on deregulation. cash transfers are increasingly used to alleviate poverty and support development in emerging economies. the idea is simple: instead of spending cash on schools and infrastructure, individuals or businesses directly receive a fixed cash amount. most recipients spent the money on projects that raise their income. halved to 21%, or 1.2 billion people, this means that the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) of halving poverty rates by 2015 has already been met. it states the role of climate change in meeting this goal, as it affects poorer people disproportionately. the appeal has been re\u2013launched to attempt to secure funding ahead of the next agricultural season. the appeal has been re\u2013launched to attempt to secure funding ahead of the next agricultural season. sixteen african countries are ensuring that at least 75% of pregnant women living with HIV receive antiretroviral treatment. this has led to a 32% drop in AIDS-related deaths between 2005 and 2011. in 2011 there were 1.8 million new HIV infections, and 1.2 million people died of AIDS-related illnesses. world's poorest countries have cut maternal and child mortality rates by 50% or more since 2000. some of the world's poorest countries have cut maternal and child mortality rates by 50% or more since 2000, according to the UNICEF report Accounting for Maternal, Newborn and Child Survival. 287 000 in the number of women dying each year from pregnancy- or childbirth-related complications. deaths among children under five years dropped from 12 million in 1990 to 6.9 million in 2011. a new study interviewed and tested over 7000 children at key points in their lives. malnutrition in early life is associated with poorer educational performance. currently one in four of all children under 5 are stunted due to under\u2013nutrition. the new systems also have clear advantages in terms of efficiency, visibility and oversight. the gains will become more evident as the new systems and techniques stabilise and mature. the world is on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal of a 50% reduction in the mortality rate by 2015. the world is on track to meet the Millennium Development Goal of a 50% reduction in the mortality rate by 2015, and reversing TB incidence. twenty seven countries have met the MDG target of a two\u2013thirds reduction in under\u2013five mortality rates. however, the overall rate of decline is not enough to meet this target globally by 2015. progress is slower towards the sanitation goal, with 2.5 billion people worldwide lacking access to better sanitation."}
