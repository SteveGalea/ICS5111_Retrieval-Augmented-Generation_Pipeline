{"summary": "the ubiquitin/proteasome system (UPS) plays a key role in the replication of coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). proteasome inhibition decreased CVB3 RNA replication, protein synthesis, and viral titers in HeLa cells. coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) is a small RNA virus in the picornaviridae family. it leads to activation of several intracellular signaling pathways. it is well-established that the UPS is the major intracellular proteolytic system of all eukaryotic cells [10], [11]. papillomavirus protein E6 targets the cellular tumor suppressor protein p53 for the UPS-mediated degradation [16], increasing studies have suggested that various viruses evolve different mechanisms to utilize or manipulate the host UPS for their own benefits [9], [20]\u2013[25]. proteasome inhibitor MG132 significantly reduced CVB3 viral RNA synthesis. both proteasome inhibitors used in the study, MG132 and lactacystin, decreased the synthesis of CVB3 capsid protein, VP1 in a dose-dependent manner. lysates were collected at 7 h pi and immunoblotted with anti-VP1 and anti-actin antibodies. medium was collected from CVB3-infected cells at 16 h pi. virus titer was determined by plaque assays. densitometric analysis further demonstrated that the increases in protein ubiquitination at 3 h, 5 h, and 7 h post-infection were statistically significant as compared to sham infection. decreased levels of free ubiquitin could be a direct consequence of the increased protein ubiquitination. ubiquitin conjugates and free ubiquitin levels were markedly knocked down after the treatment of ubiquitin siRNA. ubiquitin conjugates and free ubiquitin levels were markedly knocked down after the treatment of ubiquitin siRNA. anti-ubiquitin and anti-actin (loading control) antibodies were collected at 7 h pi to measure CVB3 progeny virion release by plaque assay. results represent data from three independent experiments. additional reduction of recycled free ubiquitin by DUB inhibition can further enhance the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. ubiquitin/proteasome system may regulate CVB3 replication. immunoreactive bands of around 60 kDa were detected in CVB3-infected cells. non-modified 3Dpol has a molecular weight of about 53 kDa. no protein ubiquitination was observed for VP1. proteasome inhibition reduces CVB3 infection in HeLa cells. proteasome inhibitors MG132 and lactacystin significantly reduced synthesis of CVB3 capsid protein, VP1, in a dose-dependent manner. lysates were counterstained with hematoxylin (blue) and immunoblotted with anti-VP1 and anti-actin (loading control) antibodies. medium was collected from CVB3-infected cells at 7 h pi and virus titer was determined. increase in protein ubiquitination at 3 h, 5 h, and 7 h post-infection were statistically significant as compared to sham infection. we have previously demonstrated that 26S proteasome activities were unchanged during CVB3 infection [9] thus, the finding of increased accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins is likely due to enhanced protein ubiquitination as opposed to reduced proteasome activity. ubiquitin conjugates and free ubiquitin levels were markedly knocked down after the treatment of ubiquitin siRNA. ubiquitin conjugates and free ubiquitin levels were markedly knocked down after the treatment of ubiquitin siRNA. protein ubiquitination is a critical process adopted by coxsackievirus. immunoblot was performed with anti-ubiquitin and anti-actin (loading control) antibodies. supernatants of infected cells were collected at 7 h pi. results represent data from three independent experiments. DUB inhibition by UCHL1/L3 inhibitors alone is not sufficient enough to block viral replication. however, additional reduction of recycled free ubiquitin by DUB inhibition further enhances the inhibitory effect of proteasome inhibitors on CVB3 replication. immunoreactive bands of around 60 kDa were detected in CVB3-infected cells. non-modified 3Dpol has a molecular weight of about 53 kDa. no protein ubiquitination was observed for VP1. virus E6-associated protein and mouse double minute 2 homolog. however, no apparent changes were observed during the time-course of CVB3 infection. these results indicate that the manipulation of the UPS by CVB3 is unlikely regulated by the above-examined ubiquitin-related key enzymes or molecules. future studies will determine whether CVB3 targets on specific ubiquitin ligases or deubiquitinating enzymes. destabilization of these short-lived host proteins is likely required for CVB3 viral RNA and protein synthesis in its lifecycle. it is speculated that nonstructural viral proteins of CVB3 could also be potential targets of the UPS for degradation. depletion of free ubiquitin by proteasome inhibitors prevents Gag ubiquitination, subsequently blocks virus progeny release/budding. ubiquitination of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein and human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 tax protein has been shown to modulate their transactivation activities. CVB3 infection results in increased protein ubiquitination and decreases in free ubiquitin levels. ubiquitination is required for the completion of viral lifecycle, likely through ubiquitin modification of viral polymerase. monoclonal anti-VP1 antibody was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. cell lysates were prepared using lysis buffer (50 mM pyrophosphate, 50 mM NaF, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 5 mM EGTA, 100 M Na3VO4, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 0.1% Triton X-100, and protease inhibitor cocktail) for immunoprecipitation, cells were lysed using lysis buffer (50 mM pyr a total of 500 g of cell lysates were incubated with a monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (1100) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by 2 h incubation with protein G-agorose beads. immunocomplexes were washed five times with the lysis buffer containing 20 mM iodoacetamide, then boiled for 5 min in the 2 non-reducing sample buffer. cells were incubated for 72 h, then fixed with carnoy's fixative (75% ethanol-25% acetic acid) and stained with 1% crystal violet. titer was calculated as plaque forming unit (PFU per milliliter) monoclonal anti-actin and anti-ubiquitin antibodies were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. the monoclonal anti-VP1 antibody was obtained from dakoCytomation. a total of 500 g of cell lysates were incubated with a monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (1100) at 4\u00b0C overnight, followed by 2 h incubation with protein G-agorose beads (Amersham) a total of 500 g of cell lysates were incubated with a monoclonal anti-ubiquitin antibody (1100) at 4\u00b0C overnight. hybridization HeLa cells were grown and maintained on two-chamber culture slides. cells were infected with either PBS or CVB3 (MOI = 10) after 1 h of incubation, cells were washed with PBS. ubiquitin-specific siRNA transfection cells were grown to 50% confluency. cells were transfected with ubiquitin-specific siRNA (200 nM) using oligofectamine."}
