{"summary": "HCoV-NL63 was identified in samples from four case patients seen between January 16 and January 27, 2015. ages ranged from 3 to 10 years (mean 6 years) all presented with subjective symptoms of fever, although only two were febrile when examined (39\u00b0C and 38.5\u00b0C, respectively) noninoculated cells (A) appear crowded 13 days postinoculation with plasma sample four. the nuclei of the infected cells appear larger, lack prominent nucleoli, and have visibly darker nuclear borders. the virus grew at both 33\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C; this figure shows virus in cells grown at 33\u00b0C. subsequently confirmed as HCoV-NL63 by RT-PCR and sequencing of the amplicons and the virus genome. similar methods were used to obtain sequence data for HCoV-NL63 from two positive respiratory samples collected in July and September 2015. a multiple sequence alignment was assembled including the four Haitian sequences and the two sequences from University of Florida Health. the tree was scaled in time by enforcing a relaxed molecular clock. one asterisk along the branch represents significant statistical support. the new strains belonged to genotype C and clustered within a well-supported sub-clade. cases tend to cluster, often in winter/late winter months in temperate areas. NL63 is the most common cause of croup in infants 6 months of age. it is also commonly seen as a coinfection with other known pathogenic viruses. viremia with HCoV-NL63 does occur, and raises the possibility that it can cause a mild febrile illness in otherwise healthy children. at a phylogenetic level, our Haitian isolates were most closely linked with isolates from Malaysia. they clustered together within a separate monophyletic clade."}
