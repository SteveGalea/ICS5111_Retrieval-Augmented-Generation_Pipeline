{"summary": "two classes of PRRs, the toll-like receptors (TLRs) and the retinoid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs) are essential for responding to viral infection. overexpression studies in vivo suggest that both the TLR and RLR pathways play vital roles in detecting and responding to flavivirus infections. changes allow RLRs to interact with downstream adaptor protein IPS-1/MAVS/CARDIF via their CARD domains. these interactions initiate a signaling cascade, resulting in the activation of transcription factors such as IRF-3, IRF-7 and NFB. a recent study showed that RIG-I preferentially recognizes single-stranded RNA molecules containing free terminal 5\u2032 triphosphates. disruption of RIG-I signaling does not ablate the induction of antiviral programs in response to dengue Virus (DENV) and west Nile virus (WNV) infection. this suggests that the RIG-I pathway mediates the initial activation of the antiviral response to WNV. however, WNV replication is enhanced in the absence of RIG-I. the role of the RLR system in controlling yellow fever virus has yet to be examined. however, both RIG-I and MDA5 expression was upregulated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells recovered from individuals vaccinated with YF-17D [15], suggesting a possible role for both of these PRRs in responding to YFV in vivo. TLR3 and TLR7 function as a broad sensor of dsRNA and ssRNA. however, stimulation of the TLR pathways results in a multivalent signaling cascade that leads to the production of IFN-/ and inflammatory cytokines. the involvement of the various members of the TLR system appears to be virus dependent. the role of these TLRs in WNV-mediated pathogenesis remains controversial. a recent study re-examining the pathogenesis of WNV in TLR3-deficient mice reported an increase in the susceptibility to WNV in these mice [25]. reduced numbers of Langerhans dendritic cells (LC) were observed in the epidermis of wild type but not TLR7/ mice following cutaneous challenge with WNV. this suggests that the TLR7 response may stimulate LC migration to the draining lymph nodes, thereby counteracting the protective function of the TLR7 response. however, survival rates of wild type and TLR7/ mice infected with WNV either intradermally or by infected mosquito feeding were not significantly different pathogenic strains of WNV fail to stimulate the IRF-3 transcriptional activity until approximately 12\u201316 h post-infection. this allows WNV to replicate to high levels prior to the induction and release of IFN-/, which provides two advantages to the virus. many cell lines infected with WNV remain responsive to soluble, intracellular and virally encoded forms of dsRNA ligands. this suggests that the WNV NS1-imposed blockage of TLR3 may be cell type and/or context-dependent. the transcription factor IRF-3 plays a pivotal role in controlling WNV replication. FN-/ receptor on the surface of infected cells triggers the activation of the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway. this in turn results in the stimulation of hundreds of promoters containing IFN-/-stimulated regulatory elements. this leads to the expression of the wide variety of interferon stimulated genes that are responsible for establishing the antiviral state within the cell. high levels of IFN-/ are present for long periods of time in pediatric dengue patients after defervescence. high levels of IFN-/ are present for long periods of time in pediatric dengue patients after defervescence. but WNV and DENV are still capable of establishing productive infections. NS2A, NS4A and NS4B completely inhibited IFN-/ stimulation of ISRE promoter. co-expression of NS4A/B and NS2B/3 resulted in cleavage of NS4A and NS4B. correct targeting of NS4B to the ER is also required for its anti-interferon activity. AT signaling by disrupting phosphorylation of STAT-1. reduction in STAT2 expression was shown to be due to NS5-mediated degradation. NS5 alone is capable of binding STAT2. the NS5 protein of Kunjin virus, an Australian substrain of WNV, requires expression within the context of the NS1-5 region. expression of the Kunjin NS5 protein results in a 100-fold decrease in replication activity. this suggests that appropriate cleavage of NS5 is required to achieve optimal catalytic activity. a single amino acid substitution in the NS2A protein of a Kunjin virus resulted in increased levels of IFN-/ expression in vitro and in vivo. however, the mechanism by which the NS2A protein of a Kunjin virus controls the level of IFN-/ expression remains to be determined. required to tease apart the viral-host interacts that determine the disease outcome."}
