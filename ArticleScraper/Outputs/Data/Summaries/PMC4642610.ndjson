{"summary": "the incidence of both acute and persisting viral infections without evidence of autoimmune sequelae suggests that this process is well controlled. the conditions promoting or stemming self-reactive (SR) T cells following viral-induced tissue damage thus need to be better defined. potential antigen-presenting cells (APC) ingesting myelin were characterized by flow cytometry. the endogenous T cell repertoire was most notable when infectious virus was controlled and paralleled myelin damage. SR T cell accumulation peaked in the persistently infected CNS during maximal demyelination."}
