{"summary": "chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs) have emerged as novel carrier candidate. chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs) have emerged as novel carrier candidate. chitosan nanoparticles (C.NPs) have emerged as novel carrier candidate. studies show that C.NPs less than 500 nm in diameter are transported through the intestinal mucosa via an endocytotic mechanism [18], [19], [20]. improved mucoadhesion and transient opening of tight junctions in the mucosal cell membrane contribute to the absorption-promoting effect of chitosan. mice were anesthetized with a mixture of oxygen/isoflurane before each experiment to alleviate their suffering. humane endpoints were chosen to terminate the distress of the experimental animal via carbone dioxide euthanasia. chitosan solution prepared in 25 mM sodium acetate buffer (pH 5.2) and 200 g/mL DNA in 25 mM of sodium sulfate solution were preheated to 55\u00b0C separately. equal volumes of both solutions were mixed together and vortexed for 10 minutes at room temperature. nanoparticle size and zeta potentials were measured using a ZetaPALS/90 plus zeta potential analyzer. coated particles were washed with MilliQ water, centrifuged and the sediment freeze-dried overnight. the IR spectra of the samples were recorded using a Tensor 27 FT-IR spectrophotometer (Bruker, Ettlingen, Germany) images were taken using a UV transilluminator (Bio-Rad) 4T1 murine breast carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. Tumor volume was calculated using the formula, Tumor Volume = (a2b)/2. \"a\" and \"b\" are the two perpendicular diameters. body weight of each mouse was also recorded to calculate tumor weight/body weight ratio. ouse legumain (1100 dilution, Santa Cruz, CA) samples were incubated with fluorescein-conjugated secondary antibodies. cells were visualized using mounting medium with DAPI. humane endpoints were chosen to terminate the distress of the experimental animal via carbone dioxide euthanasia. extreme anorexia (poor appetite and emaciated appearance) was determined as a humane endpoint. the animals were monitored twice per day and extreme anorexia was determined as a humane endpoint. .C.NPs loaded with DNA plasmids (A.C.NPs-EGFP or A.C.NPs-legumain) were prepared as follows. first, 1% (w/v) alginic acid solution in MilliQ water was preheated to 55\u00b0C. equal volumes of alginic acid and C.NPs-EGFP solutions were then mixed. spectroscopy was used to identify the chemical structure of the nanoparticles. the coated particles were washed with MilliQ water, centrifuged and the sediment freeze-dried overnight. the spectra were the average of 50 scans recorded at a resolution of 2 cm1 from 4000 to 40 cm1. 4T1 murine breast carcinoma cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA) and cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) the animals were sacrificed 24 h after the last treatment and their intestinal Peyer\u2019s patches were isolated. splenocytes were seeded into cultures of adherent 4T1 cells. cells cultured in 6-well plates were fixed in methanol and blocked with 10% goat serum. cell nuclei stained using mounting medium with DAPI. dispersed cells were incubated with PE-labeled anti-F4/80 antibody (1100 dilution) and APC-labeled anti-CD11c (1200 dilution, BD Pharmingen, San Diego, CA) splenocytes were stained after co-culture with PE-labeled rat anti-CD3 (1100 dilution), APC-labeled anti-CD4, anti-CD8a (1200 dilution) and C.NPs-legumain and A.C.NPs -legumain were 31719.3 nm and 34127.5 nm in diameter, respectively. the zeta potential of C.NPs-legumain was 0.720.25 mV. the zeta potential of A.C.NPs-legumain was 15.62.32 mV. at pH 1.9, A.C.NPs size was 2.800.19 m measured by size and zeta potential analyzer at 37\u00b0C. Particle size decreased rapidly with increasing pH at pH 1.9\u20132.7. at pH greater than 2.7, there was no difference between the A.C.NPs and C.NPs. agarose gel electrophoresis shows that after 1, 2 or 4 h incubation in simulated gastric fluid, the degradation of plasmid DNA loaded in the A.C.NPs was significantly less than naked plasmid DNA or plasmid DNA loaded in C.NPs. even after 4 h of incubation, more than 78% plasmid DNA remained in A.C.NPs-legumain. the percentage of EGFP+F4/80+ plus EGFP+CD11c+ amounted to 100% of EGFP positive cells in the three groups. compared with C.NPs, A.C.NPs increase loaded DNA uptake and expression by macrophages and dendritic cells. PE-conjugated F4/80 and APC-conjugated CD11c antibodies were used to stain (A) the macrophages and (D) dendritic cells. data are presented as mean SD of three independent experiments (**P0.01; n = 5). effects of oral vaccination with A.C.NPs-legumain on tumor growth. the survival rate of tumor-bearing mice was significantly higher in the A.C.NPs-legumain group compared with empty A.C.NPs, legumain DNA vaccine carried with S. typhi and PBS. this results suggest that A.C.NPs improve the effectiveness of oral legumain DNA vaccine against breast cancer. l2 exhibited a 1.66-, 2.75- and 3.91- fold higher number of activated T cells than when treated with empty A.C.NPs or PBS. treatment with empty A.C.NPs and legumain DNA with S. typhi showed similar results. regulatory CD4+CD25+ cells following A.C.NPs-legumain and empty A.C.NPs treatment is significantly lower than that for the other three groups. suppression of T cells immunity by A.C.NPs might contribute to the protective effect of oral legumain DNA vaccine against tumors. Characteristics of A.C.NPs-legumain and C.NPs-legumain. FTIR spectra of uncoated chitosan particles and alginate acid-coated chitosan particles. at pH 1.9, A.C.NPs size was 2.800.19 m measured by size. the band at 1736 cm1(pH 1.5) is assigned to -COOH of alginic acid because of hydrolysis of -NH-CO- I bond. Figure 3. Characteristics of C.NPs-legumain and A.C.NPs-legumain in an acidic environment. Naked, full-length legumain DNA plasmids, C.NPs-legumain, and A.C.NPs-legumain each incubated with artificial gastric fluid (pH 1.5) for the same time points to serve as a positive control. lane is observed in the A.C.NPs even after incubation at pH 1.5 for 4 h. macrophages or dendritic cells in the peyer\u2019s patches are major sources of EGFP expression after oral DNA vaccination. compared with C.NPs, A.C.NPs increase loaded DNA uptake and expression by macrophages and dendritic cells. tumor size and tumor weight/body weight ratio were significantly less in mice treated with A.C.NPs-legumain versus the PBS control, C.NPs, and empty A.C.NPs group. there was no significant difference between the A.C.NPs-legumain and legumain DNA vaccine carried with S. typhi. legumain translocates to the plasma membrane under hypoxic stimulation. hypoxia is common in tumor environment due to rapid proliferation of tumor cells and an insufficient blood supply. splenocytes were isolated and co-cultured with 4T1 cells treated with or without CoCl2. data are presented as mean SD of five independent experiments. at pH 7.0, alginic acid forms amide bonds with DNA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles by reaction of alginic acid carboxyl groups with chitosan amino groups. at pH 7.0, alginic acid forms amide bonds with DNA-loaded chitosan nanoparticles by reaction of alginic acid carboxyl groups with chitosan amino groups. studies also indicated that chitosan uptake increases the accumulation and activation of macrophages, providing an extra advantage in improving vaccination efficiency. a noninvasive, controllable, stable, and effective DNA vaccine for cancer therapy would offer a new therapeutic approach. oral vaccination increases the amount of activated CTLs (CD8+CD25+) targeting legumain. particles with alginic acid inhibit the activated regulatory T cells (CD4+CD25+) aimed at legumain. this might explain the longer survival time of mice vaccinated with A.C.NPs compared with those receiving a S. typhi-based vaccine. splenocytes were isolated (n = 5) and co-cultured with 4T1 cells pretreated with CoCl2 for 24 h. the percentage of regulatory T cell was measured via flow cytometry."}
