{"summary": "UPEC is one of the most common bacteria that can cause urinary tract infections (UTIs) no human vaccine has been developed. the use of lactic acid bacteria as a delivery system is a promising method to induce the immune system. the expression of PapG and PapG.AcmA proteins in the E. coli Origami strain was indicated as protein bands in SDS-PAGE and confirmed by western blotting. this is the first report on the successful application of lactic acid bacteria displaying the PapG.AcmA protein. UPEC bacteria establish UTIs and the presence of PapG promotes the progression of the infection to a more severe form, called pyelonephritis (4, 9). current treatment of acute UTI is limited due to the increasing rate of antibiotic-resistant strains as well as adverse effects of vaccines. papG gene segment containing histidine tag was designed, synthesized by Bioneer. pEXA vector was transformed into E. coli DH5 cells using calcium chloride method. plasmid purifications were carried out on transformed bacteria. the fidelity of the pET21a/PapG-AcmA vector was confirmed using the standard calcium chloride protocol. pET21a/PapG-AcmA and pET21a/PapG vectors were transformed using the standard calcium chloride protocol. protein expression was confirmed by western blotting using anti-his antibodies. the cell pellet was suspended in buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.3% Triton X100, 1 mM PMSF, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) the suspension was centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4\u00b0C) the sample was loaded on a Ni-NTA column. ELISA plates were coated overnight at 4\u00b0C by L. reuteri. plates were blocked with 3% PBS-BSA for 2 hours at 37\u00b0C. then 100 L of anti his-tag monoclonal antibody was added to each well. the purified plasmid was digested with NdeI and BamHI enzymes. the recombinant plasmid was double digested with NdeI/BamHI enzymes. electrophoresis was carried out on a 1% agarose gel. recombinant papG and papG-AcmA proteins were confirmed with western blotting. recombinant papG and papG-AcmA proteins were further confirmed with western blotting. the suspension was centrifuged (12,000 rpm, 20 minutes, 4\u00b0C) the sample was loaded on a Ni-NTA column (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) the concentration of each protein was detected via the Bradford method. plates were washed and 100 L of a 1/10,000 dilution of the anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody was added to each well. after washing 5 times, 100 L of a dilution of the anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase conjugate antibody was added for 90 minutes at 37\u00b0C. s showed a 629-bp band using gel electrophoresis. Lane M, DNA marker; Lane 1, PapG gene segment. 4.2. Prokaryotic Expression of the recombinant PapG and PapG-AcmA proteins. Detection of the PapG protein with anti-6 his antibody revealed a 24-kDa band in western blotting. Lanes 1 and 2, induced samples; Lane 3 un-induced sample as a negative control; M, protein size marker. ELISA results for the surface-displayed PapG protein on the surface of L. reuteri versus untreated L. reuteri showed a slight decrease in optical density (OD) after 60 days of storage at 4\u00b0C, an ELISA analysis of the PapG protein indicated a slight decrease in optical density (OD). the results of agarose gel electrophoresis of the digested plasmids showed bands at 945 bp and 629 bp for the papG-AcmA and papG gene segments, respectively. in addition, the results of sequencing confirmed both gene segments in the pET21a vector. an SDS-PAGE analysis shows a 34-kDa recombinant PapG.AcmA fusion protein in lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8. un-induced samples are shown in lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7. M, protein size marker. Detection of the PapG protein with anti-6 his antibody revealed a 24-kDa band in western blotting. purification of the recombinant papG protein showed a 24-kDa band using SDS-PAGE. Lanes 1\u201310 show different fractions of purified PapG after purification. ELISA results for surface-displayed PapG in comparison to untreated bacteria. PapG displayed on the surface of L. reuteri versus untreated L. reuteri revealed that the OD of surface-displayed L. reuteri was higher than that of the negative control, indicating the presence of PapG on the surface of L. reuteri. reuteri can act as an inhibitor of pathogenic bacteria isolated from women with bacterial vaginosis. the recombinant protein PapG was first produced and then confirmed using western blotting. the recombinant protein PapG was fused at the gene level to produce PapG-AcmA. PapG protein on the surface of L. reuteri did not decrease after 4 days of storage at 4\u00b0C. samples stored for 60 days showed a slight decrease. several studies have confirmed the stability of the vaccine in a surface display system. challenges."}
