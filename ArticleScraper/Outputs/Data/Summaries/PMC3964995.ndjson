{"summary": "antiviral peptides (AMPs) act as the first line of defence in many organisms as innate immune response. they act either directly or by eliciting immune response (11) they usually inhibit one or more stages in the life cycle of a virus, viz., entry, attachment, replication, transcription, translation, translation, translation, release, etc. peptide \u2018FluPep\u2019 inhibits Influenza virus attachment to the cells with an IC50 of 0.10 M (17. Xu et al. (18) were able to inhibit DENV protease using AVPs with a minimum IC50 of 3.3 M (17. db is a specific database of experimentally validated HIV inhibiting peptides. peptides targeting HIV were also left out of the database. peptides targeting HIV were also left out of the database. paper limited in giving information only on predicted peptides or design, peptide structural studies, peptide analogues, dendrimeric peptides, complex peptide conjugates, peptides used in combination with drugs. remaining 263 research articles were finally used to collect 2059 peptides experimentally tested for virus inhibiting activity. further 624 modified peptides have been provided separately in AVPdb. virus: target virus of the antiviral peptide. also included are virus abbreviations and taxonomy. peptides were directed against over 40 different targets. HCV, HSV 1, Influenza A virus (INFV A), Sin Nombre virus (SNV), Human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV 3), Feline leukaemia virus (FIV), RSV and west Nile virus (WNV) were most commonly targeted. these statistics were also separately calculated for modified peptides.
