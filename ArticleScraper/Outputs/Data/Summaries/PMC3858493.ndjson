{"summary": "influenza A, B and C viruses are members of the Orthomyxoviridae family. the genome of influenza A and B viruses consists of eight segments. that of influenza C virus has only seven segments since it has a single envelope glycoprotein (HEF) instead of two for type A and B viruses (HA and NA) the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 NC sequences base-pair to form two elements. the proximal element or region I (nt 1-9 of the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 ends) and the distal element or region II. these conformations are known to be critical for transcription and replication of the vRNAs. all plasmids were sequenced using a Big Dye terminator sequencing kit. cells and viruses human skin melanoma cells (SK93/2) were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% and 5% fetal calf serum (FCS) all cells were grown at 37 \u00b0C with 5 % CO2. 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 end NC sequences of NS genomic RNA segments Viral genomic RNA was extracted using Qiagen. cDNA, PCR and sequencing were performed as previously described. single-cycle growth kinetics and detection of intracellular viral RNAs MDCK cells were infected. recombinant type A (A/WSN/33) and type C (C/JHB/1/66) influenza viruses were introduced by directed mutagenesis using Quikchange II site-Directed mutagenesis kit. all plasmids were sequenced using a Big Dye terminator sequencing kit and an automated sequencer (Perkin-Elmer) SK cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 0.001 in DMEM supplemented with 0.25 g/mL TPCK-trypsin. supernatants were collected at indicated time points and virus titres were determined by plaque assay. rabbit anti-PR8, used to detect NP, was produced in house. a set of type A and type C chimeric viruses was generated. one or both type-specific extremities of the NS segment were totally or partially replaced by their counterpart from type C or type A virus. the proximal panhandle consists of 9 potential base-pairs, when the distal panhandle was defined to include the potential base-pairs up to the type A poly-U signal. type C reverse genetics was performed in 293T cells and supernatants were collected and titrated at day 10 post-transfection (p.t.) chimeric heterotypic ends were created to include proximal panhandles homotypic of the reverse genetics backbone. both type A and C viruses with 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 modified NS ends (5\u2019C/3\u2019C-proxA and 5\u2019A/3\u2019A-proxC, respectively) were rescued as efficiently as wild-type viruses. TPCK-trypsin was determined by standard plaque assays in duplicate. results indicated that the major packaging signals were not located within the distal panhandle sequence, since it was possible to rescue the 5\u2019A/3\u2019C(C5U) virus. NS segment packaging does not require wild-type 3\u2019 end sequences. Western-blot was used to evaluate the amount of NS encoded proteins. at 4 h.p.i. at high m.o.i., only 5\u2019A/3\u2019C(C5U) showed a clear increase in the production of NS1 protein, as indicated by a higher NS1/NP ratio. o.i. (2 PFU/cell), viral vRNA and mRNA levels for each segment were evaluated by specific two-step RT-qPCRs previously described. results were expressed as the mean of mRNA/vRNA Cp (crossing-point) ratios calculated on data obtained from 12 independent qPCRs. the difference in the base-pairing strength of the distal panhandle formed by the heterotypic extremities in 5\u2019A/3\u2019C(C5U) compared to wild-type could favour the attachment of the polymerase. the stability of the duplex formed by the 5\u2019 and 3\u2019 ends was indeed shown to be an important parameter for polymerase binding. a weaker distal panhandle for 5\u2019A/3\u2019C(C5U) could facilitate polymerase binding and/or specificity by attempting to rescue type A and C influenza viruses unraveled the requirement for a type specific proximal panhandle and the role of the distal panhandle in regulation of transcription."}
