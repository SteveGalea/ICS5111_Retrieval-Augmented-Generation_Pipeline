{"summary": "the most widely used class of drugs for treatment of clinical influenza is the neuraminidase inhibitors, including zanamivir and zanamivir. the clinical impact of these drugs is limited by the development of antiviral drug resistance. initiation of antiviral therapy in influenza A virus-infected individuals beyond the first 48-72 hours after the onset of influenza symptoms is associated with greater mortality. cytokines including IFNg and TNF can cause high and sustained NO production by iNOS. in vitro, NO antimicrobial activity has been demonstrated against a variety of viruses including ectromilia virus, vaccinia virus, herpes simplex type 1 viruses, coronavirus, and influenza A and B viruses 18-22. gNO in an intermittent delivery regimen of 160 ppm for 30 min every 3.5 hours can prevent methemoglobinemia and reduce the potential of host cell toxicity in vitro and in vivo. experimental mice were inoculated intranasally with an 80-100% lethal dose of WSN/33 (1000 PFU) at 5 days post-infection, the majority of mice in all experimental groups experienced weight loss. prophylactic iNO therapy increased weight loss and decreased survival of C57Bl/6 mice infected with influenza A/WSN/33. C57Bl/6 male mice were infected with 103 PFU WSN/33 and administered continuous NO at 80 ppm starting 1 hour prior to infection. continuous iNO administration at 80 ppm starting 1 hour prior to inoculation significantly decreased survival of WSN/33-infected mice compared to infected control mice administered compressed room air. iNO administration at 160 ppm for 30 min intervals every 3.5 hours starting either 1 hour prior to or 4 hours post-infection resulted in similar weight loss kinetics. intermittent high dose iNO prophylactic therapy failed to decrease viral load of infected mice. Lungs were collected 5 days post-WSN/33 infection from mice treated with (a) continuous NO at 80 ppm (grey) or compressed room air (black). C57Bl/6 male mice were infected with 103 PFU of WSN/33. they were administered intermittent NO at 160 ppm for 30 min intervals every 3.5 hours starting either 1 hour prior to infection (light grey) or 4 hours post-infection (dark grey). iNO significantly reduced survival of treated mice compared to infected controls. treated mice were euthanized compared to 80% of infected control mice. intermittent iNO administration at 160 ppm for 30 min intervals every 3.5 hours starting either 1 hour prior to or 4 hours post-infection resulted in similar weight loss kinetics. ungs were collected 5 days post-WSN/33 infection from mice treated with (a) continuous NO at 80 ppm (grey) or compressed room air (black) starting 1 hour prior to infection (n=5/group) or intermittent NO at 160 ppm (grey) or compressed room air (black) for 30 min intervals every 3.5 hours starting 1 hour prior to infection (n=5/group) Error bars represent standard deviations. methemoglobinemia, defined as 7% methemoglobin in Davidson et al. 38, may account for the decrease in survival observed in our study with continuous iNO administration at 80 ppm. iNO administered to influenza infected mice in this manner, either prophylactically or therapeutically, failed to improve survival of infected mice. mice were infected via nasal instillation with 103 plaque forming units (PFU) of influenza A/WSN/33 (H1N1; WSN/33,) in 50 l PBS. weight was recorded daily for a maximum of twelve days post-infection. mice were sacrificed when euthanasia criteria was met. genates were spun at 10,000xg for 10 min, aliquoted, and stored at -80\u00b0C for viral yield titration. cells were maintained in Eagle's MEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum and antibiotics. 12-24 hours later, medium was removed and MDCK cells were washed twice with PBS. female C57Bl/6 mice, 9-11 weeks old, were obtained from Jackson Laboratories (Bar Harbor, ME, USA) and maintained under pathogen-free conditions with a 12-hour light cycle. weight was recorded daily for a maximum of twelve days post-infection, and mice were sacrificed when euthanasia criteria was met. Lungs were harvested and frozen at -80\u00b0C. thawed, weighed, and homogenized in 1 ml PBS for 30 sec. plates were fixed with Carnoy's fixative (3:1, methanol:glacial acetic acid) significant differences in weight loss between groups were assessed by two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post-tests were performed."}
