{"summary": "quantification of gene expression in tissue samples requires the use of reference genes to normalise transcript numbers between different tissues. reference genes are most stably expressed in normal and diseased canine articular tissues and two canine cell lines stimulated with lipolysaccaride (LPS) real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most commonly utilised method of measuring gene expression in biological systems. the method provides accurate quantification of transcript number, good sensitivity over a wide range of transcript expression levels, and increasing high throughput capabilities. the bestkeeper algorithm measures the geometric mean of reference gene crossing point values. the bestkeeper algorithm measures the geometric mean of reference gene crossing point values, to determine the optimal reference gene for use in a samples set. OA is a prevalent disease of mammalian joints, which affects up to 20% of the canine population at large. OA is not solely a disease of articular cartilage, as there are changes in other articular tissues, such as fat [22], cranial cruciate ligament [23] and infrapatella fat [21] the quantification of gene expression in all articular connective tissues will help to determine the molecular pathogenesis of OA. the geNorm algorithm is employed to investigate the expression stability of 9 commonly used reference genes. the results for each of the stimulated canine cell lines showed that optimum reference genes had an M value of 0.05 (K6; SDHA and YWHAZ) to 0.07 (DH82; SDHA and HMBS) but when examining both cell lines simultaneously, the recommended reference genes were GAPDH and B2M, and the M value was increased (0.34, Table 1). 75 ACTB 0.29 0.112 HPRT 0.29 0.109 3 TBP 0.54 0.207 HPRT 0.14 0.059 TBP 0.14 0.063 2 Most stably expressed B2M/GAPDH 0.34 HMBS/SDHA 0.07 SDHA/YWHAZ 0.05 The genes with the highest expression stability for normal fat pad joints were RPL13A and TBP (M = 0.56). expression stability of the ideal reference genes for use in studies comparing both normal and OA the optimal reference genes for use in canine articular cartilage tissue samples were ACTB and SDHA (M = 0.47) for normal cartilage, and HPRT and TBP for OA (M = 0.45) articular cartilage (Figure 3) expression stability was reduced (M value = 0.57, Table 3), with SDHA and RPL13A identified as the most consistently expressed reference genes. analysis of the sample groups together identified reduced expression stability (0.59) of the two optimal reference genes (TBP and B2M) the results showed a notable decrease in gene expression for B2M and YWHAZ from the OA sample group. a strong correlation between transcript quantity and reference gene stability was only identified for one experiment. the model based approach is the best for analysing genes whose function is poorly defined. comparisons of different methods of candidate reference gene selection tend to identify the best and the worst reference genes consistently [24-26] elongation factor 1-alpha, GAPDH, actin have been compared in human articular cartilage using a crudely quantitative method. only one reference gene (B2M) we evaluated to be consistently expressed has been reported as being differentially expressed in OA articular cartilage [30] despite lack of information on suitable reference gene selection, the majority of studies quantifying gene expression in connective tissues use GAPDH as the reference gene. cell cultures should allow more control over heterogeneity of cell type, sample handling, storage and mRNA recovery, thereby minimising degradation frequently identified with pathological clinical tissue. a pair wise variation (V) of 0.15 has been recommended as an arbitrary cut-off point below which the inclusion of additional reference genes expression was not required. alternative measures of disease status, such as histological grading [33] may have helped reduce the variability in reference gene stability. canine articular tissue gene expression studies were used in this study. cell lines from the K6 cell line were myelomonocytes [34] and DH82 cell lines were of macrophage-monocytic origin [35] cell lines were cultured and harvested as previously described. ifles (infrapatella fat) and cranial cruciate ligament (n = 5) and hips (articular cartilage (n = 5) of dogs of normal bodyweight euthanized for reasons other than, and with no evidence of joint disease. all samples were stored in RNAlaterTM at room temperature immediately after harvesting and maintained at -20\u00b0C after 24 hours until use. PCR Assay Design Primer and probe sequences were designed for nine of the most commonly used control (reference) genes in man [11] using the universal Probe Library Assay Design Centre [40] transcript sequences were obtained from the canine genome database [41] using cross reference to the national centre for biotechnology information [42] amplicon systems were designed so that the last six to seven bases of a 3' primer or the probe crossed an exon-exon boundary. a single band of the expected size was identified for each probe and primer set. reporter dye FAM (6-carboxy fluorescein) and dark quencher dye probes were synthesized by Exiqon. the real-time PCR assays were all performed in triplicate using a TaqManTM ABI PRISM 7700 SDS (Applied Biosystems, California, USA) no template controls were used for each assay well. PCR assays, the CT values for each of the candidate reference genes were converted into relative quantities using the algorithm described by Vandesompele et al. the geNorm software package calculated the pairwise variation (V Value) of each individual gene within the tissue. genes with the lowest M value are the most stably expressed. cells were harvested after washing with fresh media by repeated passage of 1 ml of phenol/guanidine HCl reagent (TrizolTM; Invitrogen, Dorset, UK) total RNA was extracted and isolated using spin columns (RNeasy; Qiagen Ltd, Crawley, UK) Tissue Samples Articular cartilage, cranial cruciate ligament and infrapatella fat samples were obtained from healthy and diseased dogs. elution of total RNA was performed using 30 l of RNase free water. total RNA samples were stored at -80\u00b0C until use. PCR assay design Primer and probe sequences designed for nine of the most commonly used control (reference) genes in man. primers were designed to be hybridised on different exons, with an intronic sequence greater than 1,100 base pairs, to maintain specificity for mRNA. a genomic DNA assay [43] was also used to determine whether genomic contamination was present in any sample.
