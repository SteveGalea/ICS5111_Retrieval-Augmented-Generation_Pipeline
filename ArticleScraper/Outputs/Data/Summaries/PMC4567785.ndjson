{"summary": "a large number of serotypes or genotypes of IBV strains have been reported worldwide. variants emerge due to changes in the IBV genome through point mutations, deletions, insertions or RNA recombination. these variants are often responsible for IB outbreaks in vaccinated flocks. combination of live IBV vaccines has been shown to induce high and broad protection from challenges with several heterologous virulent variants. the aim of this study is to evaluate the protection conferred by available live IBV vaccines when used in a strategic manner against the two prominent Middle East variants. IBV challenge strains Virulent strains of IBV IS/885/00-like and IS/1494/06-like were used as challenge viruses. the isolates were submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, Padova, Italy as third passage allantoic fluid. group III was sham-inoculated at 1-day and 14 days old. each chick was inoculated via oculo (50 l)-nasal routes. the haemagglutinin antigens of IS/885 and IS/1494 were prepared in the authors\u2019 laboratory based on the method described before. five days after challenge, birds were humanely killed, a section of trachea was carefully dissected out and placed into warm (37\u00b0C) trachea was cut using a tissue chopper (The Mickle Laboratory Engineering) for each of the rings, the maximum possible ciliary score is 40. ks that were euthanased at five day post challenge (dpc) were examined individually for gross tracheal and kidney lesions and scored accordingly using a four-point scale. for the trachea, 0=no lesions, 1=congestion, 2=mucoid exudate plug in the trachea and bronchi, air sacculitis, perihepatitis and pericarditis. IBV challenge strains Virulent strains of IBV IS/885/00-like and IS/1494/06-like were used as challenge viruses. the isolates were submitted to the Istituto Zooprofilattico Sperimentale delle Venezie, Padova, Italy as third passage allantoic fluid. each chick was inoculated via oculo (50 l)-nasal routes. the birds were observed daily for clinical signs during the postchallenge period. the haemagglutinin antigens of IS/885 and IS/1494 were prepared in the authors\u2019 laboratory based on the method described before. five days after challenge, birds were humanely killed, a section of trachea was carefully dissected out and placed into warm (37\u00b0C) trachea was cut using a tissue chopper (The Mickle Laboratory Engineering) total gross lesions scores for each group were calculated based on the mean of scores observed per total number of chicks. in both vaccinated groups, mild clinical respiratory signs began to appear at six days post vaccination (dpv) vaccinated groups showed significantly higher levels of IBV ELISA antibody titre. chicks of group II (d0:H120+CR88, d14:CR88) showed significantly higher antibody titre (P0.05) than group I (d0:H120, d14:CR88). bars represent the meanSD for eight birds in each group. all 10 chicks of unvaccinated-challenged chicks showed signs of typical IBV infection at 1 dpc. depression with ruffled feathers, listlessness and huddling, head shaking, tracheal r\u00e2les, sneezing and coughing. no clinical signs were observed in both of the vaccinated-challenged groups. a II 83 0 (0/0)a 0 (0/0)a 94 0 (0/0)a 0 (0/0)a III 0 1 (0/2)b 1 (0/2)b 0 1 (0/1)b 1 (0/1)b Group I=d0:H120+CR88, d14:CR88; group III=unvaccinated control remained free of gross lesions. five days after the IS/885 challenge, congestion of the trachea and mild clinical respiratory signs began to appear at six days post vaccination. the signs included head shaking, tracheal r\u00e2les and sneezes. these signs subsided by 12 dpv. the cut-off titre=834 FIG 2: Haemagglutination inhibition (HI) antibody titres log2 against infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) antigens at 30 days of age. bars represent the meanSD for eight birds in each group. ciliostasis test and gross lesions of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV)-vaccinated chicks following challenge with IS/885 or IS/1494 isolates IS/885 IS/1494 Ciliostasis test Gross lesions Groups Protection score Trachea Kidney Protection score Trachea Kidney I 60 0 (0/1)a 1 (0/1)b 80 0 (0/1)a 0 (0/1)a 0 (0/1)a 0 chicks in group II showed no tracheal or kidney lesions. however, no significant difference was observed between the two vaccinated groups. live H120 vaccination offered 100 per cent kidney protection from both isolates. immunisation with live H120, H52 and D274 given singly was reported to produce little cross-protection from challenge with other nephropathogenic IBV strains. both vaccination programmes provided excellent protection from IS/885 compared with that of group I. at 30 days of age the mean ELISA titre and the mean 793B HI titre in group II were significantly higher than the other vaccinated group. combined live IBV vaccination at day-old and revaccination at 14 days-old has provided an immunological boost compared with the other vaccination schedule (group 1). 120 and CR88 vaccines given at day-old followed by CR88 vaccine at day 14 of age confer excellent protection from virulent variant IS/885 and IS/1494 viruses. more work is needed to establish the underlying immune mechanisms for such higher and broader protection conferred by this vaccination programme."}
