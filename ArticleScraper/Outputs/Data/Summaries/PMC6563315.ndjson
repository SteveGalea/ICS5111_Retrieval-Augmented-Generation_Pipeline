{"summary": "dromedary camels in the middle east are the immediate animal source of the MERS epidemic caused by MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) the evolutionary origin of MERS-CoV remains to be ascertained. bats harbor CoVs that can evolve to cause epidemics in humans and other animals. bat CoVs closely related to other human CoVs, including human CoV 229E and human CoV NL63, were recently discovered [26,27,28], suggesting that bats are the important animal source of CoVs that may emerge in humans. in 2016\u20132017, outbreaks of severe watery diarrhea were reported in suckling piglets from farms in Guangdong Province, China. the evolutionary relationship of the two novel alphaCoVs to other known CoVs is also discussed. the evolutionary relationship of the two novel alphaCoVs to other known CoVs is also discussed. Detection of CoV was performed by amplifying a 440-bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene of CoVs using conserved primers (5\u2019-GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA-3\u2019 and 5\u2019-ACCATCATCATCNGANARDATCATNA-3\u2019) PCR mixture (25 L) was prepared and PCR conditions were set as described previously in an automated thermal cycler. degenerated primers were designed according to multiple alignments of the genomes of other alphaCoVs with complete genomes available. for Rs-BatCoV HKU32, a total of 53 sets of primers were used for PCR. maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tress with 1000 bootstrap replicates of ORF1ab and S genes were constructed using PhyMLv3.0. cDNA obtained from RT was used as the template for PCR amplification. cDNA obtained from RT was used as the template for PCR amplification. bat samples from mainland china were collected by the Guangdong Institute of Applied Biological Resources (Guangzhou, China) to prevent cross contamination, sterile disposable swabs with protective gloves were used during sample collection and changed between samples. PCR mixture (25 L) was prepared and PCR conditions were set. strands of PCR products were gel-purified using the QIAquick gel extraction kit (QIAgen) both strands of PCR products were sequenced with an ABI Prism 3130x genetic Analyzer. degenerated primers were designed according to multiple alignments of the genomes of other alphaCoVs with complete genomes available. a total of 53 sets of primers (available on request) were used for PCR. a total of 44 sets of primers (available on request) were used for PCR. maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tress with 1000 bootstrap replicates of ORF1ab and S genes were constructed using PhyMLv3.0. cDNA obtained from RT was used as the template for PCR amplification. RT-PCR for a 440-bp fragment of RdRp gene was positive in samples from 32 bats (2.9%) of 5 species belonging to 4 genera. 11 samples contained alphaCoVs, 3 contained Sarbecovirus (lineage B betaCoVs) and 18 contained Merbecovirus (lineage C betaCoVs) hi-BatCoV HKU10 TLC13, GD Hypsugo pulveratus Chinese pipistrelle 2 0 - SK01 Miniopterus magnater Western bent-winged bat 1 0 - LMHP Myotis chinensis Large myotis 10 0 - SK01, GZ Myotis ricketti Rickett\u2019s big-footed bat 93 1 / (1.1) 7 alphaCoV sequences from Rhinolophus sinicus (Chinese horseshoe bats) captured in Hong Kong showed 84% nt identity to the corresponding sequence of BtRfAlphaCoV/HuB2013 (GenBank accession no.

HCoV 229E, an alphaCoV, is also likely originated from bats 219 to 333 years ago."}
