{"summary": "the covalent linkage of a carbohydrate to the nitrogen atom of an asparagine plays an important role in the physiology of many living organisms. most software for glycan modeling on a personal computer requires knowledge of molecular dynamics to interface with specialized programs such as CHARMM or AMBER. but these web-based tools are generally limited to a few canonical glycan conformations. Glycosylator provides more functionality for analyzing and modeling glycans than any other available software or webserver at present. each class is represented by a hexagon; full circles connecting classes indicate a class that contains an instance of the previous one as an attribute. the structure of an N-Acetyl-D-Glucosamine will be imported as a Molecule instance. all missing atoms will be added according to the CHARMM force field."}
