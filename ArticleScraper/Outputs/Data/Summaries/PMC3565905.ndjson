{"summary": "infectious agents contain conserved motifs on their surface that react with conserved pattern recognition Toll-like receptors of the host. surface proteins and carbohydrates come into contact with B-cell receptors, membrane-bound immunoglobulin of isotype M (IgM) or D (IgD) and often induce potent antibody responses, which take some weeks to fully develop. 'serum therapy' was the first effective treatment of infectious diseases. the advent of antibiotic therapy with the advances in vaccine design has meant that serum therapy was almost abandoned for many infectious diseases. however, hyperimmune human sera immunoglobulin preparations are still used to treat different bacterial toxins and virus related diseases, including those caused by cytomegalovirus. all immunoglobulins are composed of two identical light (L) chains. the heavy chains contain one variable domain (VH) and three or four constant domains (CH1, CH2, CH3 and CH4) depending on antibody isotype. the light chains contain only one variable domain (VL) and a single constant domain (CL) humanized mAbs, only the CDRs of the murine mAbs (mCDRs) from both the mVH and the mVL, are 'grafted' into a human backbone antibody [120,121]. transgenic mice, obtained by a genetic replacement of the mouse immunoglobulin genes with human counterparts, are used to obtain fully human mAbs. in this review we focus on the mAb-therapies now underway in clinical trials (Table 1) designed for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infectious diseases. both these worldwide epidemics require new strategies due to the lack of a definitive cure and effective vaccines. pro-140 anti-CCR5 receptor Human mAb Progenics/PDL Therapy of HIV/HCV co-administrated with ribavirin Phase II Immunomodulatory mAbs TREMELIMUMAB CP 675,206 Anti-CTLA-4 Humanized mAb Pfizer Therapy of HIV infection Phase I. fusion of viral and cellular membranes is a basic entry mode for enveloped viruses. the cell surface is more directly accessible for the action of the antibodies. inhibition of the release of progeny virus is another possible mechanism of neutralization, as demonstrated by antibodies directed against influenza A virion surface neuraminidase. mAbs directed to the external proximal membrane region of HIV gp41 can interfere with conformational changes needed for membrane fusion. antibodies can block receptor engagement by binding to specific virus surface proteins (1), as well as by binding to the viral receptor or co-receptor on host cell surface (2). mAbs directed against spike viral proteins, as well as against host receptors, may act at an early stage of infection by preventing the binding of the virus on the cell surface. antibodies recognizing the CD81-binding site within the envelope glycoprotein E2 have been shown to block viral entry. receptors for the Fc segment of IgG are expressed on the surface of different types of cells, including natural killer cells (NK), monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. CDC is initiated by complement component C1q binding to the Fc region of IgG, which is in turn bound to the foreign antigen on the cell surface. the subsequent release of cytokines and cytotoxic granules containing perforins and granzy the strongest evidence for a role for ADCC antibody in disease progression comes from a study by Baum et al. of the multicenter AIDS Cohort Study [24]. NKR cells coated with gp120 were significantly lower than non-rapid progressors at any visit. functional exhaustion affects many antiviral properties of both mouse and human CD8+ T cells. loss of effector functions proceeds in a hierarchical manner starting with defects in IL-2 production and proliferation, followed by the decrease of TNF production. exhausted T cells end up deleted if the high antigenic load persists. some cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor- (TGF) may also contribute to the lack of T cell functionality during situations of high antigenic burden. blockade of the PD-1 signaling pathway improves antigen-specific T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion in LCMV-infected mice. mAb against human T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD28 developed by TeGenero to treat B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. this is a mAb against human T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD28 developed by TeGenero to treat B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. viral receptor glycosylation is widely shared among different viruses. glycans mask the CD81-binding site and, therefore, nAb epitopes. glycan shielding may represent an additional strategy used by HCV to evade the antibody response. combination therapy with mAb cocktails prevents escape variants for many viruses, including influenza [53], coronavirus [54] and LCMV [55], and broad neutralization in the sera of some individual HIV infected donors can be associated with single or four to five principal specificities. nAbs play a critical role in HCV disease outcome. dose escalation study was performed in healthy adult volunteers starting with 1 mg/kg and escalating to 3, 10, 30 and 50 mg/kg after a 10-day post-infusion safety review. a phase II study of MBL-HCV1 in chronically infected HCV patients undergoing liver transplantation has been planned. only a small number of broadly neutralizing mAbs have been identified from infected patients. the effectiveness of a mix of broadly neutralizing antibodies increased synergistically compared to the effect of the individual antibody. the synergy effect was relatively weak, with a maximum of two- to four-fold enhancement, between antibody pairs, thereby increasing neutralization titers about 10-fold in triple and quadruple antibody combinations. the use of antibodies in the cocktail mode is already recognized for other pathogens or toxins. high doses of the three neutralizing antibodies were given to 14 HIV-1-infected individuals at weekly intervals over three months. the antibodies showed distribution and elimination kinetics similar to those seen for other human-like antibodies. monoclonal antibody 2G12 had a significantly longer elimination half-life (21.8 +/- 7.2 days) than monoclonal antibodies 4E10 (5.5 +/- 2.2 days) and 2F5 (4.3 +/- 1.1 days) mAbs could be proposed as suitable components of microbicides to fight HIV entry at mucosal surface. most mAbs in clinical trials have been produced using a system called Chinese Hamster Ovary cell (CHO-Cell) fermentation [85], including 2G12 used along with 2F5 and 4E10 antibodies as a cocktail. production costs could be 10 to 100 times lower than when using conventional bioreactors. mAbs directed against CD4 and against the co-receptor CCR5 have been developed and are being analyzed in clinical trials. Ibalizumab, a humanized mAb, binds CD4 on T cell surface away from the binding site for MHC class II molecules. resistance testing showed reduced susceptibility relative to baseline. ibalizumab resistance is associated with a reduction in the maximum percentage inhibition. the average half-life of ibalizumab under normal physiological circumstances is 3 to 3.5 days. anti-CCR5 mAbs are being investigated in two modes of administration. the classical intravenous (IV) form, and subcutaneous (SC) form. the trial involving SC administration is the first to bear the proof of concept for a mAb administered subcutaneously in HIV-1 infected subjects. the maximum tolerated dose of IV PRO 140 has not been determined. the study involving PRO 140 SC administration showed virologic suppression between successive doses. no changes in R5 viral susceptibility to PRO 140 following three weeks of monotherapy. a phase IIb, national, multicenter, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was initiated and is currently recruiting participants. compared to CCR5 inhibitors, resistance to CCR5 inhibitors may increase the sensitivity of the resistant virus to certain neutralizing antibodies. bavituximab is the first in a new class of patented antibody therapeutics that target and preferentially bind to exposed phospholipids. it is currently being evaluated in randomized phase II clinical trials for non-small cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer. the lower dose level appears to be more active in HCV patients than the high dose does. a longer-term evaluation is needed to adequately compare their effectiveness. mAbs interfering with two major inhibitory networks are currently being studied. mAbs targeting the PD-1 signaling pathway reinvigorate antigen-specific T-cell responses and promote an immune response to fight tumors. in cancers, a strong correlation between increased PD-L1 expression on tumors and a negative survival prognosis in patients has already been observed. most clinical experience with PD-1 blockade has been gained with MDX-1106 in the tumor setting. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. objective responses were observed in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. an adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use. tremelimumab is a fully human IgG2 mAb directed against CTLA-4. it binds to activated T lymphocytes and acts as an IL-2 stimulant. it is currently in worldwide phase III development for malignant melanoma. tremelimumab demonstrated an excellent safety profile, with a promising antitumor efficacy against HCC in 17 patients, as well as an intense antiviral activity. a significant decline in serum HCV viral load was observed, this being associated with an increase in anti-HCV immune response in 76% of patients. fusion of viral and cellular membranes is a basic entry mode for enveloped viruses, such as HIV and HCV [12], which still differ in specific aspects of viral entry and assembly. the cell surface is certainly more directly accessible for the action of the antibodies; therefore, the phase of virus entry is one of the most important targets in preventing viral infection at the origin. mAbs directed to the external proximal membrane region of HIV gp41 can interfere with conformational changes needed for membrane fusion. antibodies can block receptor engagement by binding to specific virus surface proteins (1), as well as by binding to the viral receptor or co-receptor on host cell surface (2). mAbs directed against spike viral proteins, as well as against host receptors, may act at an early stage of infection by preventing the binding of the virus on the cell surface. antibodies recognizing the CD81-binding site within the envelope glycoprotein E2 have been shown to block viral entry. receptors for the Fc segment of IgG (Fcy receptors; FcRs) are expressed on the surface of different types of cells, including natural killer cells (NK), monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils. the receptor for the Fc segment of IgA, the FcR, involved in phagocytosis and induction of microbe killing, is expressed on monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils. the strongest evidence for a role for ADCC antibody in disease progression comes from a study by Baum et al. of the multicenter AIDS Cohort Study [24]. NKR cells coated with gp120 than did non-rapid progressors at any visit. functional exhaustion affects many antiviral properties of both mouse and human CD8+ T cells. loss of effector functions proceeds in a hierarchical manner starting with defects in IL-2 production and proliferation, followed by the decrease of TNF production. exhausted T cells end up deleted if the high antigenic load persists. some cytokines, such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor- (TGF) may also contribute to the lack of T cell functionality during situations of high antigenic burden. blockade of the PD-1 signaling pathway improves antigen-specific T cell proliferation and cytokine secretion in LCMV-infected mice. mAb against human T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD28 developed by TeGenero to treat B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. this is a mAb against human T cell co-stimulatory molecule CD28. it binds to CD28 and activates T cells without the need for prior T cell antigen receptor (TCR) signaling. viruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to protect themselves from antibody binding. one of these, the viral receptor glycosylation, is widely shared among different viruses. glycans mask the CD81-binding site and, therefore, nAb epitopes. ab cocktails prevents escape variants for many viruses, including influenza [53], coronavirus [54] and LCMV [55], and broad neutralization in the sera of some individual HIV infected donors can be associated with single or four to five principal specificities. current understanding of the nAb response raised against HCV suggests that E2 is the major target, and that multiple epitopes within E2 may be targeted by both linear-and conformation-dependent antibodies. escalation study was performed in healthy adult volunteers starting with 1 mg/kg and escalating to 3, 10, 30 and 50 mg/kg after a 10-day post-infusion safety review. a phase II study of MBL-HCV1 in chronically infected HCV patients undergoing liver transplantation has been planned. only a small number of broadly neutralizing mAbs have been identified from infected patients. combining the action of three out of four antibodies increased the neutralizing activity up to 200 times. the combination of two potent neutralizing mAbs against HIV, VRC01 and PG9, although not synergistic, can mediate additive neutralization viral activity and provides an improved neutralization coverage of 90% to 97% of viral strains. high doses of the three neutralizing antibodies were given in combination to 14 HIV-1-infected individuals at weekly intervals over three months. the antibodies showed distribution and elimination kinetics similar to those seen for other human-like antibodies. monoclonal antibody 2G12 had a significantly longer elimination half-life (21.8 +/- 7.2 days) than monoclonal antibodies 4E10 and 2F5 (4.3 +/- 1.1 days) mAbs could be proposed as suitable components of microbicides to fight HIV entry at mucosal surface. most mAbs in clinical trials have been produced using a system called Chinese Hamster Ovary cell (CHO-Cell) fermentation [85], including 2G12 used along with 2F5 and 4E10 antibodies as a cocktail. mAbs directed against CD4 and against the co-receptor CCR5 have been developed and are being analyzed in clinical trials. Ibalizumab, a humanized mAb, binds CD4 on T cell surface away from the binding site for MHC class II molecules. resistance testing showed reduced susceptibility relative to baseline. ibalizumab resistance is associated with a reduction in the maximum percentage inhibition. the average half-life of ibalizumab under normal physiological circumstances is 3 to 3.5 days. anti-CCR5mAb004 mAb synergizes in vitro with other ARV classes. other anti-CCR5 mAb is PRO 140, a humanized mAb that synergizes with small-molecule CCR5 antagonists in laboratory studies. the maximum tolerated dose of IV PRO 140 has not been determined. the study involving PRO 140 SC administration showed virologic suppression between successive doses. no changes in R5 viral susceptibility to PRO 140 following three weeks of monotherapy. a phase IIb, national, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was initiated and is currently recruiting participants. the use of antibodies together with combined therapy increases the drug number and, therefore, the therapeutic opportunities. compared to CCR5 inhibitors, resistance to CCR5 inhibitors may increase the sensitivity of the resistant virus to certain neutralizing antibodies. bavituximab is the first in a new class of patented antibody therapeutics that target and preferentially bind to exposed phospholipids. the therapeutic effect of bavituximab appears to be due to ADCC of tumor and virus-infected cells. the lower dose level appears to be more active in HCV patients than the high dose does. future studies evaluating longer bavituximab treatment durations may hold promise as IFN-free HCV therapeutic regimens. mAbs targeting the PD-1 signaling pathway reinvigorate antigen-specific T-cell responses and promote an immune response to fight tumors. in cancers, a strong correlation between increased PD-L1 expression on tumors and a negative survival prognosis in patients has already been observed. mAbs targeting the PD-1 signaling pathway reinvigorate antigen-specific T-cell responses. patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, melanoma, or renal-cell cancer. objective responses were observed in approximately one in four to one in five patients with non-small-cell lung cancer. an adverse-event profile does not appear to preclude its use. tremelimumab is a fully human IgG2 mAb directed against CTLA-4. it binds to activated T lymphocytes and results in inhibition of B7-CTLA-4-mediated down-regulation of T-cell activation. it acts as an IL-2 stimulant. tremelimumab demonstrated an excellent safety profile, with a promising antitumor efficacy against HCC in 17 patients. a significant and progressive decline in serum HCV viral load was observed. a synergistic use of antibodies against different checkpoint molecules might represent the next stage in immunotherapy for chronic infectious diseases. these 'evolving glycan shields' have been shown to decrease sensitivity to antibody neutralization. other factors of antibody escape for HIV include trimerization of the gp 120 and gp 41 that can shield vulnerable epitopes better exposed on the individual monomeric subunits. the variable loops of gp120 that are a prime target for nAbs, which usually have a very narrow breadth of reactivity. MBL-HCV1 is a fully human monoclonal antibody isolated from transgenic mice. it is directed to a highly conserved linear epitope of HCV E2 glycoprotein. it is able to neutralize pseudoviruses from multiple HCV genotypes. it has demonstrated efficacy in preventing HCV genotype-1 infection. a number of trials evaluating different formulations of anti-HIV monoclonal antibodies are now in progress. the first trial assessed a chimeric monoclonal antibody CGP 47,439 to the V3 loop of the HIV-1 envelope gp120 over 21 weeks. subsequent studies evaluated the kinetics of monoclonal antibody F105 directed to the CD4-binding site of gp120 [68,69]. a cocktail of the three broadly neutralizing mAbs - 2G12, 4E10 and 2F5 - was able to delay viral rebound in patients whose infections were fully suppressed by antiretroviral treatment. the other two mAbs, 4E10 [77] and 2F5 [78], recognize two adjacent highly conserved epitopes on the membrane-proximal ectodomain of the HIV-1 envelope protein gp41. in vitro selection with 2F5 and 4E10 showed that resistance to these nAbs can be difficult to achieve and can lead to selection of variants with impaired infectivity. mAbs could be proposed as suitable components of microbicides to fight HIV entry at mucosal surface. the process yields five grams of purified antibody from 250 kg of tobacco. production costs could be 10 to 100 times lower than when using conventional bioreactors. the medicine is the first plant-produced antibody to be greenlit for clinical testing by MHRA. gp120 binding to CD4 appears to exert its antiviral property. other monoclonal antibodies that competitively inhibit gp120 binding interfere with MHC class II immune function [87,88] ibalizumab is 3 to 3.5 days. this is consistent with observations of other anti-CD4 antibodies. a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, phase IIa study has evaluated the ibalizumab efficacy. IV form of PRO 140 tested as monotherapy in HIV-1 subjects with only R5 virus detectable [96] showed potent and prolonged antiviral activity with a 1.83 log10 mean reduction in HIV-1 RNA and safety relative to placebo. all PRO 140-treated subjects treated with 10 mg/kg experienced a 1-log10-unit reduction in HIV-1 RNA level, there being just one exception. a substantial amount of SC PRO 140 can be expected to drain into the lymphatic system and potentially encounter CCR5+ cells in lymphoid tissues prior to reaching the bloodstream. however, serum concentrations may not provide a full picture of the overall exposure following SC dosing of PRO 140. a phase IIb, national, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study was initiated and is currently recruiting participants. the use of CXCR4 specific mAbs could result in only little or transient effect on the overall viremia. there is a pressing need for antiviral agents that are effective against multiple classes of viruses. phospholipids are widely expressed on infected host cells or on viral envelopes. the therapeutic effect of bavituximab appears to be due to ADCC of tumor and virus-infected cells. in the infectious disease setting, bavituximab causes opsonization and clearance of infectious virus from the bloodstream. three completed phase I HCV clinical trials have shown that bavituximab is generally safe and well-tolerated. mAbs targeting the PD-1 signaling pathway reinvigorate antigen-specific T-cell responses and promote an immune response to fight tumors. mAbs targeting the PD-1 signaling pathway reinvigorate antigen-specific T-cell responses and promote an immune response to fight tumors. the progression of acute HCV infection to the chronic stage is associated with a high level of PD-1 on HCV-specific CD8+ T cells. the clearance of HCV infection is associated with lower levels of PD-1 expression [36]. most clinical experience with PD-1 blockade has been gained with MDX-1106 in the tumor setting. studies of the role for CTLA-4 in chronic infections have produced mixed results. the role of CTLA-4 in chronic infections seems to be more defined. PD-1 and CTLA-4 expressing HCV-specific T cells were profoundly dysfunctional. tremelimumab is being investigated for prostate, breast and pancreatic cancer. it is also being investigated for prostate, breast and pancreatic cancer in various countries. tremelimumab is likely a direct result of breaking immune tolerance upon CTLA-4 blockade. the need to treat HIV and HCV infectious diseases has reawakened interest in mAb-based therapy. the results will help to create models for the further development of such drugs. new approaches, such as using mAb cocktails or combining mAbs with available drugs, will improve effectiveness.
