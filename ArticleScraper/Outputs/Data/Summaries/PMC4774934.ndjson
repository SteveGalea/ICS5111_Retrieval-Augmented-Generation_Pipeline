{"summary": "in humans, one of the most abundant classes of antimicrobial peptides is -defensins [1, 2]. -defensins are subdivided into myeloid -defensins [e.g., human neutrophil peptides (HNP) 1\u20134] and enteric -defensins [e.g., human defensins (HD) 5 and 6], expressed by specialized Pane Defa gene cluster spans 0.8 Mbp and is interspersed with non-defensin genes. this step is mediated by MMP7. mice lack functional -defensins in ileal paneth cells. MAdV-1 pathogenesis in adult mice is typified by encephalitis. the virus is able to cross the blood-brain barrier and stimulate inflammation. this is consistent with the ability of both human and mouse -defensins to neutralize infection by MAdV-1 in cell culture. -defensins [19] focused our studies on the human enteric -defensin HD5 and three specific isoforms of mouse -defensins. we used a replication-competent MAdV-1 construct expressing and encapsidating a fusion protein between eGFP and the minor capsid protein IX (MAdV-1.IXeGFP) we found a dose-responsive increase in the mean particle size (z-average diameter) of MAdV-1 with increasing concentrations of HD5 and Crp2. this was not observed for Crp4 or HD5Abu. Defensins bind to MAdV-1 and potently neutralize infection in vitro. defensins, and their Paneth cells secrete pro--defensins [6, 8, 13] pro-defensins did not bind to MAdV-1 or block infection in vitro. we infected wild type mice and isogenic Mmp7 -/- mice with MAdV-1. oral gavage or (C and D) intraperitoneally (i.p.) with MAdV-1 as follows: (A) 1x104 i.u. (n = 10), (B) 1x105 i.u. (n = 20, combined from two independent experiments), (C) 1x102 i.u. (n = 8), and (D) 1x103 i.u. (n = 8) the abundance of commensal bacteria in feces does not differ between wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice. we treated mice with a combination of ampicillin, neomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole to deplete the intestinal microbiota of wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice. we then assessed survival and weight change for both antibiotic-treated and mock-treated mice upon challenge with MAdV-1. alterations in the composition of the commensal microbiota due to differential expression of Mmp7 are unlikely to explain the survival difference between wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice. a significant survival difference between the antibiotic-treated and control mice was still observed. wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice were euthanized 28 days post-gavage. mice were euthanized due to illness 10 days (no Abx) or 12 days (Abx) p.i. arrows point to yellow discolored bowel segments of infected mice. qPCR quantified fecal pellets or the ratio of MAdV-1 genomes to cellular genomes in (D) brain, (E) spleen, and (F) distal ileum. data are the individual values for each wild type (closed symbols) or Mmp7 -/- (open symbols) mouse overlaid with the group mean SD. unmarked days were not significant (P>0.05) Crypts with abnormal Paneth cell phenotypes were significantly more prevalent in Mmp7 -/- mice than wild type on day 11 but not on day 9. reduced survival of Mmp7 -/- mice correlated with increased viral loads in multiple tissues and more severe lesions. of 560 crypts per mouse was assessed. data are the percent of crypts with fused or depleted Paneth cells for each wild type (closed symbols) or Mmp7 -/- (open symbols) mouse overlaid with group mean SD. histologic findings suggest robust adaptive immune response to MAdV-1 in wild type mice that is absent or delayed in Mmp7 -/- mice. all wild type mice developed detectable serum NAbs by day 9 p.i., which were increased in titer on day 11. wild type but not Mmp7 -/- mice mount a protective humoral response to MAdV-1 infection. we exposed mice of both genotypes systemically (via i.p. injection) or mucosally (via intranasal instillation) with ovalbumin. mice of both genotypes mounted humoral responses to both systemic and mucosal antigen and with identical kinetics. so, the humoral response in Mmp7 -/- mice is not globally compromised; rather the specific NAb response to enteric MAdV-1 infection is delayed. HD5 was the most potent peptide and capable of nearly complete inhibition. in contrast, Crp4 had no detectable antiviral activity even at the highest concentrations tested. we then measured viral aggregation as a function of -defensin concentration. values are the means of at least three independent experiments SD (A) for HD5 (open triangle), proHD5 (filled circle), and HD5Abu (filled square) and (C) for Crp2 (open triangle), Crp4 (filled circle), and Crp23 (open square) data are the means of at least three independent experiments SD. ins in cell culture, Mmp7 -/- mice succumbed in greater numbers to MAdV-1 infection. yellow discolorations of the small intestine were noted at necropsy for both wild type (5 of 6) and Mmp7 -/- (20 of 24) mice euthanized due to illness. in unchallenged wild type mice, Paneth cells are the only cells in the intestine that produce MMP7 [22] survival from parenteral challenge was equivalent for both mouse genotypes at two different MAdV-1 doses. a major role for MMP7 in protection from oral viral infection is at the initial site of infection in the small bowel. the abundance of commensal bacteria in feces does not differ between wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice. we treated mice with a combination of ampicillin, neomycin, vancomycin, and metronidazole to deplete the intestinal microbiota of wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice. a significant survival difference between the antibiotic-treated and untreated mice was still observed. alterations in the composition of the commensal microbiota due to differential expression of Mmp7 are unlikely to explain the survival difference between wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice. mice depleted of commensals maintain increased susceptibility to MAdV-1. mice were infected with MAdV-1 (1x105 i.u.) and monitored for weight loss. all of the Mmp7 -/- mice lost weight between 9 and 11 d p.i. four of the six mice in the day 11 cohort were overtly ill, including two that were euthanized on day 10. we quantified copies of the MAdV-1 genome in feces to monitor viral shedding. in each case, we observed virtually identical viral shedding and viral loads in tissues of wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice up to day 7 p.i. on day 9, there was a significant increase in viral loads in Mmp7 -/- spleens compared to wild type. n = 6 except for days 0 and 1, where n = 2) scored for the infiltration of inflammatory cells into the mucosa on the following scale: 0, none; 1, scattered cells; 2, multifocal accumulations of small clusters of 3\u20135 cells; 3, multifocal accumulations of mild clusters of 6\u201310 cells with edema. MLN follicular hyperplasia and splenic marginal zone hyperplasia were significantly increased in wild type mice compared to Mmp7 -/- mice on day 11 p.i.. MLN follicular hyperplasia and splenic marginal zone hyperplasia were significantly increased in wild type mice. the inability of Mmp7 -/- mice to mount a timely protective NAb response to MAdV-1 infection explains the reduced survival in these mice after viral challenge. Fig 6. Hallmarks of adaptive immune activation in spleens and MLNs of wild type but not Mmp7 -/- mice. we exposed mice of both genotypes systemically (via i.p. injection) or mucosally (via intranasal instillation) with ovalbumin (OVA) as an adjuvant. all mice of both genotypes mounted humoral responses to both systemic and mucosal antigen and with identical kinetics. studies of - and -defensins in viral pathogenesis suggest a more profound effect of defensins on limiting innate immunopathology than as direct antivirals. despite their direct antiviral activity in cell culture, the effect of -defensins on MAdV-1 pathogenesis appears to be indirect. this is the first example of a direct role for an -defensin in engendering an adaptive response to a pathogen. there are several possibilities for how -defensins could enhance the adaptive immune response to MAdV-1. one possibility is that an immunogenic complex of virus and defensin forms in the intestine. a limitation of the Mmp7 -/- model is that it is a complete null mutation in all tissues; therefore, we cannot exclude the contribution of MMP7 functions other than activation of Paneth cell pro-defensins to survival differences in MAdV-1 infected mice. the survival phenotype in these mice is due to pro-defensin processing by MMP7 rather than other potential MMP7-dependent functions. MMP7 deficiency affects neutrophil and CD103-positive dendritic cell efflux in the lung and pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-) activation on macrophages, but has not been reported to globally attenuate adaptive immune responses. this is consistent with our finding that MMP7 deficiency does not globally attenuate adaptive immune responses. studies of a natural viral pathogen reveal a profound effect of functional -defensins in the ileum on survival from oral infection. delayed NAb response appears to be primarily responsible for the survival difference between the wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice. viruses were concentrated from supernatant by polyethylene glycol precipitation. the cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 20 mM glycine and 0.5% Triton X-100 in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), and stained with anti-hexon antibody 8C4. purified Crp4 was produced in E. coli and purified by RP-HPLC. antiviral assays used a virus concentration producing 50\u201380% maximum signal. total well fluorescence was measured by Typhoon. mice were mated to generate progeny mice heterozygous for Mmp7. these mice were then intercrossed to generate wild type and Mmp7 -/- lines. mice were infected for experiments under ABSL2 conditions. mice were treated with 100 l of a mixture containing pharmaceutical grade ampicillin (100 mg/ml, Sandoz), neomycin sulfate (100 mg/ml, PCCA), metronidazole benzoate (100 mg/ml, PCCA), and vancomycin HCl (50 mg/ml, Mylan) by oral gavage for 5 d. mice were given a 100-fold lower concentration of the same antibiotic mixture or vehicle control a ology Mice were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture under Avertin anesthesia. a board-certified pathologist scored blinded and randomized samples using a previously established scoring system. cellular genomes were quantified against a standard curve of pKBS2-MAdV1 using primers M1FF2 and M1FR2 (5\u2019-TCCAACCAATTCCTAA-3\u2019) for both reactions, conditions consisted of 40 cycles of PCR with 55\u00b0C annealing temperatures using an iCycler (Bio-Rad) limits of detection were defined by the ratio of viral to cellular gene copies detected in samples from each tissue of uninfected mice two-fold serial dilutions of heat-inactivated serum were incubated with MAdV-1 for 45 min at RT. after 2 d, cells were stained for hexon, scanned, and background-subtracted fluorescence was quantified using ImageJ software. the greatest dilution of serum inhibited virus by at least 50% was considered the neutralizing activity of each sample. each treatment group of 10 animals was divided into two cohorts of 5 mice. the cohorts were also euthanized on different days to obtain cardiac blood. an additional wild type mouse was inoculated i.p. and boosted i.p. on days 14 and 21. data were compared using a log-rank (Mantel-Cox) test. wild type and Mmp7 -/- mice were both propagated on CMT-93 mice. cMT-93 cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Sigma-Aldrich), 4 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 0.1 mM nonessential amino acids. the cells were then fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized with 20 mM glycine and 0.5% Triton X-100 purified Crp4 was synthesized, refolded, and purified using the same method as for HD5. antiviral assays used a virus concentration producing 50\u201380% maximum signal. total well fluorescence was measured by Typhoon. mice were mated to generate progeny mice heterozygous for Mmp7. these mice were then intercrossed to generate wild type and Mmp7 -/- lines. mice were housed under specific pathogen-free conditions. mice were treated with 100 l of a mixture containing pharmaceutical grade ampicillin (100 mg/ml, Sandoz), neomycin sulfate (100 mg/ml, PCCA), metronidazole benzoate (100 mg/ml, PCCA), and vancomycin HCl (50 mg/ml, Mylan) by oral gavage for 5 d. mice were given a 100-fold lower concentration of the same antibiotic mixture or vehicle control a mice were infected with MAdV-1 after 23 d of continuous antibiotic treatment. mice were exsanguinated by cardiac puncture under Avertin anesthesia. a board-certified pathologist scored blinded and randomized samples.
