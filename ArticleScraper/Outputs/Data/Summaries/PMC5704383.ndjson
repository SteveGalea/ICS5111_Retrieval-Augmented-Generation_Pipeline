{"summary": "the virus is an enteric disease of swine that has emerged as a worldwide threat to swine herd health and production. substantial research has been conducted to assess viability of the virus on surfaces of vehicles and equipment, in feed and water. but little is known about the persistence in PEDV-infected carcasses and effective disposal methods thereof. compost material matrices collected from windrow sections yielded no detectable viral RNA. the combination of time and high temperature of the compost cycle effectively degraded viral RNA."}
