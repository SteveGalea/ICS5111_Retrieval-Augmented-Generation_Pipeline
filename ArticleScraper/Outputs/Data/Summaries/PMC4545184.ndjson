{"summary": "the aim of this article is to describe in detail a methodology to generate and characterize human IgG monoclonal antibodies obtained from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) the interest to study human antibodies has grown in many different fields of research. many research groups are interested in the pathology caused by auto-antibodies1. single antibodies with exactly the same antibody sequence found in the donor can be studied. protocol Informed consent was obtained from the participants of the study. centrifuge 300 x g at RT for 10 min. Count the PBMCs with a Neubauer chamber as previously reported14. Process the PBMCs as in section 2 or store them for later use as follows: 10 million PBMCs for freezing per Cryovial tube. in the first tube add 5 l of anti CD22 PerCP antibody. in the second tube add 20 l of anti IgG PE. if the sorting of a higher number of cells is desired, scale up all reagents. gate is a set of value limits that serve to isolate a specific group of cytometric events, in our case cells, from a large set. in the case of a sorting gate the value limits allow the recovery of the cytometric events, cells, which are inside of the boundaries defined: CD22+ and IgG+. plate 50 cells in 50 l of RPMI 1640 complete medium per well in 96 round well plate. add 60 l of EBV supernatant (containing 3 - 4 x 108 viral copies/ml) clone growing should be evident by observing aggregates of round cells that usually lie in the middle of the round bottom well. at this step, change media in the same way that the previous weeks but only with complete RPMI 1640 media. centrifuge again at 400 x g for 5 min, and stored dry at -80 \u00b0C until RNA extraction. freeze cells at 10 \u2013 30 million/ml in 90% fetal calf serum and 10% DMSO. if larger amounts of cells are wanted, continue expansion of the clones in bigger surface plates. use 50 l/well of goat F (ab)2 anti-human IgG Fc peroxidase conjugated diluted 1:20,000 in incubation buffer. add 100 l/well substrate solution containing 0.1% 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-TMB. measure the absorption at 450 nm, within 30 min after stopping the reaction. superscript III cells direct cDNA synthesis kit allows obtaining DNA from 10,000 cells to one cell. for cell numbers between 1 x 106 and 1 x 104 use the reverse transcription system, following the instruction of the manufacturer. in a volume of 100 ml of 1x TBE add 1 g of agarose (1% agarose gel) heat the solution in the microwave for approximately 1 min, until the agarose gets dissolved. add 4 l of 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide (or equivalent DNA dye) and mix. electropherograms should be clean and correspond to a single immunoglobulin sequence. if the PCR products show unclear or mixed immunoglobulin sequences, please consider to clone them using the TopoTA system. the ratio used should be 1 : 2 (vector : insert) use 1 l of the ligation to transform DH5 bacteria. spread bacteria in blasticidin or zeocin plates. the antibodies in the media can characterize their reactivity in vitro and in vivo. the antibodies in the media can be used to characterize their reactivity in vitro and in vivo. centrifuge 300 x g at RT for 10 min. Count the PBMCs with a Neubauer chamber as previously reported14. Process the PBMCs as in section 2 or store them for later use as follows: 10 million PBMCs for freezing per Cryovial tube. in the first tube add 5 l of anti CD22 PerCP antibody. in the second tube add 20 l of anti IgG PE. if the sorting of a higher number of cells is desired, scale up all reagents. at least 5,000 wi38 cells are needed per well in a 96 round well plate. Irradiate the number of cells necessary to cover the wells needed for plating IgG+ B cells. Plating Sorted PBMCs, EBV Infection and Growing Dilute the sorted PBMCs to plate 50 cells in 50 l of RPMI 1640 complete medium per well in the 96 round well plate. if clones are growing, analyze this first media exchange by ELISA as. clone growing should be evident by observing aggregates of round cells that usually lie in the middle of the round bottom well. at this step, change media in the same way that the previous weeks but only with complete RPMI 1640 media. the cells in the 6-well plate become confluent (approximately 20 x 106 cells), transfer to a 60 mm culture plate. freeze cells at 10 \u2013 30 million/ml in 90% fetal calf serum and 10% DMSO. if larger amounts of cells are wanted, continue expansion of the clones in bigger surface plates. use 50 l/well of goat F (ab)2 anti-human IgG Fc peroxidase conjugated diluted 1:20,000 in incubation buffer. add 100 l/well substrate solution containing 0.1% 3,3\u2019,5,5\u2019-TMB. measure the absorption at 450 nm, within 30 min after stopping the reaction. the superscript III cells direct cDNA synthesis kit allows obtaining DNA from 10,000 cells to one cell. for cell numbers between 1 x 106 and 1 x 104 use the reverse transcription system. l of 1x TBE add 1 g of agarose (1% agarose gel) heat the solution in the microwave for approximately 1 min, until the agarose gets dissolved. then add 4 l of 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide (or equivalent DNA dye) and mix. if the PCR products show unclear or mixed immunoglobulin sequences, please consider to clone them using the TopoTA system, to obtain isolated sequences and then proceed to step 9. the ratio used should be 1 l of the ligation to transform DH5 bacteria. spread bacteria in blasticidin or zeocin plates, depending on the type of vector used. incubate the cells in the plate at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2 for 24 hr. change the culture medium to medium without fetal calf serum. Collect the medium from the plates 4 days later. positive clones should be positive in the ELISA at least three times in different supernatants of the same clone. this sequence has been obtained after cloning the immunoglobulin heavy and lambda chain pair from a clonally expanded B cell. 1st PCR primers Forward (5\u2019-3\u2019) Reverse (3\u2019-5\u2019) IgG 5\u2032 L-VH 1 ACAGGTGCCCACTCCCAGGTGCAG 3\u2032 C CH1 GGAAGGTGCACGCCGCTGGTC 5\u2032 L-VH 3 AAGGTGTCCAGTGCCGCTGGTC 5\u2032 L-VH 4/6 CCCAGATGGGTGCGCAG 5\u2032 L-VH 5 CAAGGAGTCTGTGCGCAG 5\u2032 L AG 5\u2032 EcoRI VH1 to 5 CAACCGGAATTCAGAGGTGGCTGGTGCAG 3\u2032 NheI JH 3 CTGCTAGCTAGCTGAGAGAGACGGTGACCATTG 5\u2032 EcoRI VH3 CAACCGGAATTCAGAGGTGGCTGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG ACTTTGGTC 5\u2032 EcoR1 V 2 24 CTTCCGGAATTCAGATATTGTGATGACCCAGAC 5\u2032 EcoR1 V 2 28 CTTCCGGAATTCAGATATTGTGATGACCCAGAC 5\u2032 EcoR1 V 2 30 CTTCCGGAATTCAGATGATGACTCAGTC 5\u2032 EcoR1 V 3 15 CTTCCGGAATTCAGAAATAGTGATGACGCAGTC 5\u2032 EcoR1 V 4 1 CTTCCGGAATTCA 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 A 0.076 0.077 2.003 0.080 0.138 0.102 0.188 0.338 0.040 2.041 0.051 0.081 B 2.011 0.085 0.074 0.069 0.081 0.122 0.372 2.133 0.119 0.097 0.072 0.072 C 0.068 0.179 0.091 0.073 0.077 0.097 0.606 1.882 0.081 2.071 0.094 0.075 D negative or non-IgG producing clones shown in dark grey Discussion In this manuscript, all the steps for the generation of IgG antibodies from human PBMCs are presented in detail. cloning of the PBMCs will be limited to the number of PBMCs at the beginning of the experiment. a technique to produce human recombinant monoclonal IgG antibodies leaves the heavy and light chains pairs of the human immunoglobulin intact. if the ligation is not successful, an extra step of cloning the 2nd PCR product in a TopoTA system is recommended."}
