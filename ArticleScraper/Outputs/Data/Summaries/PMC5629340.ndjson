{"summary": "each mouse was from an independent CC line that had undergone 5\u201314 generations of inbreeding. each mouse was from an independent CC line that had undergone 5\u201314 generations of inbreeding. PCR products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, with the WT allele producing a 535-bp product and the knockout allele producing a 646-bp product. by and large, matings of heterozygous mice produced Mendelian ratios of offspring. in the third generation we observed transmission ratio distortion with a depletion of homozygous mutant pups. mice were phenotyped for responsiveness to methacholine again by whole body plethysmography on day 28. mice were phenotyped for responsiveness to methacholine again by whole body plethysmography. gels were vacuum-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes, blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences) and probed with a rabbit polyclonal antibody (Ab) raised against murine MUC5AC or MUC5B. the secondary Ab was Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1/15,000 in Odyssey blocking buffer. phenotype data for CC founder strains and pre-CC mice are given in Table S1 and Table S2 respectively. for statistical analyses of pre-CC mice, MUC5AC and MUC5B intensity values were natural log-transformed. we removed these data points (n = 10 mice) from further analysis. QTL mapping was carried out using the data set after removal of values below the apparent threshold of detection. we used the 1.5 LOD drop method to approximate confidence interval for QTL (Dupuis and Siegmund 1999). we used samples from the control group (PBS, n = 3) of GSE34764 to characterize the distribution of gene expression. then categorized genes in the bottom fifth percentile as not expressed while genes above or equal to the fifth percentile were considered expressed. gene expression by qRT-PCR RNA from the right lung middle lobe was isolated using the RNEasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) gene expression by qRT-PCR RNA from the right lung middle lobe was reverse transcribed using the High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) tochemistry for MUC5B and BPIFB1 was performed as previously described. sections were incubated for 1 hr with FC Block (BD Pharmigen) at 1:200 in 5% normal goat serum (NGS) total, intraepithelial (stored), and luminal AB-PAS positive and MUC5B or BPIFB1-positive volume densities (Vs) were quantified using 10 or 20 magnification micrographs as previously described (Harkema et al. 1987). gene expression data from mouse models of asthma were identified in NCBI\u2019s GEO database. mice of each of the eight CC founder strains from The Jackson Laboratory were phenotyped, plus additional C57BL/6J mice. all mice were singly housed, with alpha-dri bedding, under normal 12-hr light/dark cycles. heterozygous mice produced Mendelian ratios of offspring. in the third generation we observed transmission ratio distortion with a depletion of homozygous mutant pups (four born, nine expected), suggesting either loss of Bpifb1 has some effect on genotype ratios that is incompletely penetrant. mice were phenotyped for responsiveness to methacholine again by whole body plethysmography on day 25. agarose gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting to detect MUC5AC and MUC5B in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. the secondary Ab was Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG. the secondary Ab was Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-rabbit IgG, diluted 1/15,000 in Odyssey blocking buffer. for statistical analyses of pre-CC mice, MUC5AC and MUC5B intensity values were natural log-transformed. we removed these data points (n = 10 mice) from further analysis. analysis of variance was used to test whether phenotypes varied among CC founder strains. QTL mapping was carried out using the data set after removal of values below the apparent threshold of detection. the proportion of variance explained for each QTL was estimated by regression of phenotypes on genotype for the peak locus. evidence that the gene is differentially expressed in whole lung RNA samples as a function of allergen treatment. for this criterion, we conducted an analysis of differential expression using Partek software (version 6.6) and used nominal P-values 0.05 and fold change >1.5. gene expression by qRT-PCR RNA from the right lung middle lobe was isolated using the RNEasy Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and reverse transcribed using the High Capacity RNA to cDNA kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) sections were incubated for 1 hr with FC Block (BD Pharmigen) at 1:200 in 5% normal goat serum (NGS) and for 3 hr with 1:1000 MUC5B (H-300, Santa Cruz Biotech) or 1:200 BPIFB1 (HP8044, Hycult Biotech) primary antibodies were applied. eight gene expression data from mouse models of asthma were identified in NCBI\u2019s GEO database (GSE1301, GSE13032, GSE13382, GSE1438, GSE19223, GSE27066, GSE34764, and GSE6858) in all but one case (GSE1438), data were downloaded then normalized (using the default robust multi-array average with quantile normalization method) allergen treatment increased MUC5AC 10-fold and MUC5B 6-fold. we then phenotyped CC founder strains for MUC5AC and MUC5B BALF levels. the effect of strain was greater than the effect of treatment alone in the A/J strain. each pre-CC mouse was derived from a different CC breeding funnel. we then phenotyped 154 incipient lines of the CC. each pre-CC mouse was derived from a different CC breeding funnel. the genes encoding both mucins are located on Chr 7. the fact that the two trans-pQTL act in trans indicates differential regulation of each mucin. expression data were available for 45 of the 47 protein-coding genes. eight genes were associated with BALF MUC5AC at a nominal P-value threshold of 0.05. eight genes were associated with MUC5AC at a nominal 0.05. tJ strains have musculus-derived alleles that are distinct from all other CC founder strains. this result indicates that the musculus haplotypes contain a functional variant (or variants) that cause lower MUC5B. we could not rely on gene expression data because the microarray platform was based on C57BL/6J sequence. previous studies in humans documented expression of BPIFB1 in goblet cells of the respiratory epithelium (Bingle et al. 2010; Gao et al. 2015); upregulation in CF (Bingle et al. 2012); and COPD (Gao et al. 2015; Titz et al. 2015). in contrast, BPIFA1 is down-regulated in asthma models. expression of both proteins increased significantly as a function of allergen (Figure 3B) in a highly correlated fashion (r = 0.98, P 0.001, Figure 3C) b Analysis adjusted for strain. c No upregulation of Muc5ac detected in this study. der p 1 challenge elicits a correlated increase in MUC5B and BPIFB1 in airway epithelium. qRT-PCR found that Bpifb1 mRNA was undetectable in KO mice. we measured secreted MUC5B in Bpifb1 WT and KO mice at baseline and after der p 1 allergen sensitization and challenge with PBS or Der p 1 allergen. MUC5AC was not affected by genotype in nave or PBS-exposed mice. results from histological analysis of airway sections were consistent with BALF MUC5B data. AB-PAS staining and MUC5B immunohistochemistry of large airways of nave or Der p 1 sensitized and challenged WT and Bpifb1 KO mice. Arrows indicate regions of higher magnification panels. images representative of group based on average quantified total and luminal signal. the presence of musculus-derived alleles in the CC was greatly facilitated by the use of the CC. musculus-derived alleles were associated with lower MUC5B compared to domesticus-derived alleles. musculus-derived alleles were present in >30% of pre-CC mice. the existence of distinct QTL for MUC5AC (Chr 13) and MUC5B (Chr 2) indicates that these mucins are under the control of distinct regulatory mechanisms in this model of muco-obstructive airway disease. however, neither mRNA was correlated with the levels of secreted MUC5AC or MUC5B. previous studies have provided evidence that BPIFB1 is involved in human airway diseases in which MUC5B is upregulated. CF (Scheetz et al. 2004; Bingle et al. 2012) and COPD (Gao et al. 2015; Titz et al. 2015), as well as IPF (Yang et al. 2013; Gao et al. 2015). our data provide clear evidence that BPIFB1 is causally related to MUC5B BALF levels. we found evidence of an increase in the fraction of AB-PAS positive luminal substance in Bpifb1 KO mice. the total histological signal in the airways was not affected by genotype. supplementary material is available online at www.genetics.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.1534/genetics.117.300211/-/DC1.
