{"summary": "the 2010\u20132011 winter season was characterized by low cases of pandemic virus and a predominance of Influenza A H3N2 and Influenza B. increased cases of pneumonia and hospitalizations were observed at the national Institute for Respiratory Diseases in Mexico City in these seasons. oseltamivir-resistant virus showed low rates of the H275Y substitution. antigenic drift is caused by mutations in the antigenic sites adjacent to the receptor binding site of HA. this is why monitoring the molecular and functional properties of HA becomes essential for effective vaccine development. a delay in the wave of pandemic A/H1N1 confirmed cases was observed. viral typing was performed by rtPCR and according to the Center of Disease Control (CDC) guidelines. informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. 13 samples were sequenced using high-density oligonuclotides microarrays and 10 samples were sequenced using parallel sequencing with the Illumina platform. PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C, 2min; 40 cycles (94\u00b0C, 30 s; 66\u00b0C, 3min); 72\u00b0C, 5min. PCR fragments from each sample were pooled and labeled with CY3 (Nimbelgen One-color DNA Labeling Kit, REF 05 223 555 001) independently and 800 ng of the labeled reaction were used. barcoded libraries for NGS were produced using Nextera XT DNA Library Preparation kit. reads were mapped to A/California/07/2009(H1N1)/2009(H1N1). data was obtained from the NIAID Influenza Research Database (IRD) Phylogeny Full-length nucleotide sequences were selected for all segments of human influenza H1N1 viruses reported between 2011 and December 31, 2014 in IRD. we included the ten whole genome sequences (2013\u20132014) from this study for the analyses of all 8 viral segments. informed consent was provided according to the Declaration of Helsinki. 13 samples were sequenced using high-density oligonuclotides microarrays. 10 samples were sequenced using parallel sequencing with the Illumina platform. polymerase (Platinum Taq DNA polymerase, Thermo Scientific, Foster City, CA, USA) and cocktail of primers included in the resequencing oligo kit. PCR conditions were 94\u00b0C, 2min; 40 cycles (94\u00b0C, 30 s; 66\u00b0C, 3min); 72\u00b0C, 5min. array contains 8,236 control probes and 121,928 H1N1(2009) probes. reads were mapped to A/California/07/2009(H1N1)/2009(H1N1). assembly was performed using Velvet package (Velvet V1.2.10) and visualized with TABLET (V 1.15.09.01) a 100% coverage was achieved for each virus, with at least 90 depth for HA, NS, NA, M and NP segments. a 100% coverage was achieved for each virus, with at least 90 depth for HA, NS, NA, M and NP segments. the PA, PB1 and PB2 segments had 80% coverage at >10x. sequences from this study were deposited at the NIAID Influenza Research Database (IRD, http://www.fludb.org) the mean age of the patients was 45.4 20.8 years and 76.4% of these individuals were male. the mean BMI was 29.2, and 23.5% required mechanical ventilation for 15.2 (mean) days. substitutions detected by whole genome sequencing of the AH1N1 09pdm influenza virus were classified by viral gene segment, year of isolates and description of the mutation. the analysis was performed using the A/California/07/2009(H1N1)/2009 strain amino acid sequence as reference and comparing global sequences at FluSurver from 2009 to 2016.

VOI is calculated automatically from known structures and captures sites both in viral oligomerization sites as well as crystal contacts. VOI is derived from small ligands seen in known crystal structures. strains from new york (CY189313, CY189361, bootstrap value 66). these sequences share two substitutions in Signal Peptide of the immature HA at amino acid 7 and 15 (-11 V/I and -3 A/T). group 3 (KR271599 and KR271567) clustered with strains isolated in New york, Washington and Helsinki. ML trees from 1200\u20131300 A(H1N1)pdm09 viruses deposited in GenBank from 2009 to 2014 were produced with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. phylogenetic tree included 7\u201317 sequences from 2012 (PB2, 10; PB1, 8; PA, 7; HA, 10; NP, 11; NA, 8; M, 17 and NS, 17); obtained for this study. six putative glycosylation sites on HA (Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr) at positions 28, 40, 104, 304, 498 and 557 were predicted using NetNGlyc 1.0 server. this indicates that Mexican isolates from 2013\u20132014 maintain a glycosylation pattern similar to California 2009. substitutions observed in pandemic A/H1N1 virus strains classified by gene segment, year of circulation and description.

HA substitutions to H1 antigenic sites showed different patterns of change through 2009\u20132014 winter seasons. the amino acids in red represent changes detected in sequences of isolates from 2011\u201312 and white represent the changes detected in isolates from 2013\u201314. the outbreak strain of swine-origin influenza A/H1N1 virus infection in 2009 is still circulating during the winter season in many countries. 321K of PA, I397M, I435T of PB1, S498N of NP, N44S, V241L, N369K of NA V80I of M1, L90I of NS1 and S185T, S203T, E374K and S451N of HA appeared together during the evolution of influenza virus in Mexico. however we found other unique substitutions in PB2 G644R and T676I, PB1 A substitution PB2-R591P is on a position where R has been implicated in a more efficient replication of pandemic H1N1 viruses in mammals [28] but its specific effect has not been particularly characterized yet. a recent significant change occurred in virus from 2013 to 2014. other roles of residues include VOI, I13V in PA [38], S482N in NP[35] and G18S in NP[35] and A33T in M1; A122T in NS1 [39] [40]. BSL, VOI in NA T452I involved in BSL [49] and in NS1 S74T [40, 48], related to BSL and VOI. Accession numbers of sequence used as reference and accession numbers of sequences from this study.
