{"summary": "clinical laboratories are rapidly adopting viral species-specific nucleic acid amplification for virus identification. newer technologies are being employed in cases where routine screening fails. microarrays and sequence-independent amplification can be used to screen for all viral families simultaneously. study used sequence-independent amplification of partially purified viral nucleic acid from mouse tissue followed by low-scale shotgun sequencing. of the five viruses identified, two belonged to the Picornaviridae family, and three to the Reoviridae family.
