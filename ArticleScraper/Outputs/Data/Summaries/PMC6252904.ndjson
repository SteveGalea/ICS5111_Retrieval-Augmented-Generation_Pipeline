{"summary": "influenza virus is a negative-sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus. it is segmented into eight (Subtypes A, B) or seven (Subtype C) separate strands. each segment codes for at least one protein, and it seems likely all subtypes express twice as many proteins as its number of segments. IAV depends on animal reservoirs, where they can reside [9\u201313] and transfer between species that share same environment [14]. in the past 100 years, there have been three major epidemics with extensive fatalities [16] and one minor one (mostly because of quick action from the WHO and health practitioners) the viral genome is organized according to the structural features of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNP) rather than the numbering of the RNA segments in the genome. more than 10 major proteins are encoded by these eight segments together with a variety of additional frame-shifted proteins. can induce apoptosis, regulate host interferon response and modulate susceptibility to bacterial superinfection. may influence intracellular localization of PB1 [21] PB1-N40 N-terminally truncated version of PB1. 1565 NP 498 Nucleoprotein: binds the ssRNA into a large ds (NP protein) helix. binds the ssRNA into a large ds (NP protein) helix. also thought to be important during budding process where virion breaks away from host cell. each of the eight segments is individually packaged into a structurally distinct vRNP particle. the medium-gray/green beads represent the NP (Segment 5 in Table 1). the NP-scaffold does not play a significant role in protecting the vRNA. the viral polymerase binds to the partially complementary 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the vRNA segment. the progression is from top to bottom. it is important to remember that [43] reports a left-handed helix. an additional component of the viral polymerase is the viral polymerase. the nucleocapsid proteins are PB1, PB2, PA and NP. the viral polymerase is essential for the transcription of the viral mRNA sequences and replication of the viral genome. nonstructural protein 1 (NS1) and 2 (NS2/nuclear export protein) are also known to be lodged in the nucleocapsid. NS1 plays a critical role in suppression of the 3\u2032-end processing of the host mRNA and blocking the hosts innate immune response stimulated by interferon-/. the viral envelop is built from lipids derived from the host membrane. comprises the matrix protein 1 (M1; from Segment 7) which is located at the interface between the nucleocapsid and the lipid envelop. it supports the arrangement of the eight RNP on the inner surface of the lipid envelope. the main sialic acid is N-acetylneuramic acid in mammals and birds. these molecules can be connected with an 2,6 bond, which is abundant on the surface of cells in the upper respiratory tract of humans. the function of such glycans is diverse, interfacing with signaling proteins and various structural and modulatory roles. HA1 is the globular head that binds to specific glycans on epithelial cells. HA2 anchors the HA to the viral membrane and facilitates membrane fusion of the virus with the lipid bilayer of the endosomes. the fusion peptide (from HA2) interacts with the lipid bilayer of the endosomes. the path to the nucleus appears to be diffusion driven. the heterotrimer (PA-PB1-PB2) of each vRNP is drawn to the nucleus. by hijacking the host transcriptional machinery, the virus can gain access to many of the host\u2019s mRNA processing proteins. each individual vRNA is capable of transcribing its own sequence using the heterotrimer (PA, PB1 and PB2) to accomplish this task. however, replication cannot be carried out by a single vRNA. it is important to distinguish the difference between transcription and replication. the PA + PB1 + PB2 must assemble into a new viral polymerase. the nascent NPs and vRNA is used to form the new vRNP [20, 44, 69]. based on the images of the RNPs, there are some indications as to how the process works. the trans-acting viral polymerase captures the nucleus of the host cell. the trans-acting viral polymerase captures the sequence in the 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 direction, making an antisense copy of whatever template is present. when the replication is complete, the structure is eventually released. host Pol II and resident spliceosome factors become involved in this transcription process. nascent copies of M1, NP, PA, PB1 and PB2 (produced from the viral mRNA) require the special actin-activated proteins\u2014importins 1, 3, 5 and 7 [47, 78]. the importin cannot by itself import the viral proteins and requires NS1 and other alternatively spliced units of the viral mRNA transcripts to induce sufficient fit to allow the import of M1, NP and PB2. this PA + PB1 complex must then associate with PB2. this complexity may seem like a wild ride \u2018around Robin Hood\u2019s barn\u2019. cRNA and ccRNA bind the viral polymerase heterotrimer (PA-PB1-PB2) cRNA and ccRNA have the NP complex coating onto which the newly synthesized polymerase heterotrimer can bind. the apparent factor determining this is the binding of M1 to the vRNPs, and not the cRNPs. the envelop layer encloses the viral material enabling the virion to leave the infected cell. the role of RNA secondary structure The vRNA is wrapped up in a scaffold composed of the NP proteins. one observed interaction occurs at the terminal ends of each vRNA segment. RNA hairpins bound together by complementary sequences are called a \u2018kissing loop\u2019 [85, 86]. the evidence for the kissing loop is supported by sequence alignment methods and in vitro experiments involving disrupting the complementary sequences. this suggests that for a particular subtype of IAV to jump between species, the subtype has to acquire specific mutations in HA, access effective nuclear import/export factors and produce proteins that successfully block host immunity. an actual scan of the free energy and variation in optimal and suboptimal structures of Segment 7 (Segment M) is shown for four different viral strains. the spectra represent scanning for RNA secondary structure over a window size of 200 nt. the very dark gray/blue boxes represent regions of stable RNA secondary structure that are largely independent of the scanning window size. the graph spectrum was generated using Genepoem [90] and calculated using vs_subopt/vswindow [89] using default settings (window size 200 nt, Kuhn length 4 nt) the spectrum is generated using default settings (window size 200 nt, Kuhn length 4 nt), and the spectrum is generated using Genepoem [90]. the calculations by Kobayashi et al. were for the cRNA sequence. regions at positions 950\u2013964 and 967\u2013994 appear weaker. the region at position 219\u2013240 appears prominently in both Figures 3 and 4. the two connected semi-opaque gray/green boxes are used to indicate the corresponding sequence ranges reported in Gavazzi et al. [84] and the dashed lines indicate the connection between Segment 2 and Segment 8. this lower intensity gray/blue indicates that there is a greater degree of variation in the RNA secondary structure in these locations. key points In this work, we summarize our current understanding of the structural aspects of transcription and replication. we also outline the current knowledge of existing IAV proteins and the role of alternative splicing and frameshift in their formation.
