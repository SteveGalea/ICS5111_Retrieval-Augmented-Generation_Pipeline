{"summary": "type I IFN-mediated susceptibility to bacterial infection involves immunomodulatory effects on macrophages, monocytes, and neutrophils. a recent report highlighted the potential of Plasmodium DNA to trigger type I IFN responses in vitro. the factors responsible for systemic loss of cDC function during Plasmodium infection remain unclear. CD8\u2013 cDCs possess a greater intrinsic capacity for processing antigens onto MHCII molecules than CD8+ cDCs. type I IFN signaling in hematopoietic cells impaired CTL responses via a direct effect on cDCs (29) but the underlying cellular mechanisms were not fully characterized. in murine models of GVHD, type I IFN signaling in hematopoietic cells impaired Th cell responses via a direct effect on cDCs (29) type I IFN signaling suppressed Th1 responses during experimental severe malaria independently of suppressive effects on monocytes. mice were assessed for clinical symptoms from day 5 p.i. and for survival (2 independent experiments). PBMCs were assessed by flow cytometry for cell surface expression of MHCII on TCR\u2013/B220\u2013/CD11b+/Ly6Chi single cells exhibiting low granularity (2 independent experiments). spleens were assessed for numbers of and cell-surface MHCII expression by, CD11b+ Ly6Chi monocytes and (F) proportion and absolute numbers of CD4+ TCR+ cells producing IFN- without ex vivo restimulation ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice expressed more cell surface MHCII in the spleens of PbA-infected Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice compared with control-treated, PbA-infected WT mice. this observation was unexpected given that type I IFN promotes, rather than suppresses, monocyte recruitment and activation. however, monocyte recruitment to the spleen and acquisition of cell surface MHCII was abrogated in Cc IFNAR1 genetic deficiency and -IFNAR1 treatment resulted in 50% less CD86 upregulation by cDCs. similar observations were made in Ccr2\u2013/\u2013 mice, devoid of splenic monocyte recruitment. flow cytometric analysis of cell surface CD86 expression by bulk splenic cDCs was performed on day 4 p.i.. mixed BM chimeric mice (n = 6\u20137) 4 days p.i. with PbA (2 independent experiments) Ifnar1+/+ and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 splenic cDC subsets in these animals at 4 days p.i. with PbA. CD86 upregulation was approximately 50% reduced in CD8+ and CD8\u2013 Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 cDC subsets, compared with corresponding Ifnar1+/+ cDC counterparts. type I IFN signaling in cDCs impairs capacity to prime IFN-producing Th1 cells in vivo. we compared Th1 responses in cDC-infected CD11c-Cre Ifnar1fl/fl mice and Cre\u2013 Ifnar1fl/fl littermate controls. expression of IFN- was increased on a per cell basis in proliferated OTII cells from Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice compared with WT recipient mice. expression of IFN- was again increased on a per cell basis in proliferated OTII cells from Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice. WT mice (n = 5) were infected with PbA or left uninfected. on day 3 p.i., bulk splenic cDCs were assessed by flow cytometry. on day 4 p.i., splenic CD4+TCR+ single cells were assessed for intracellular IFN- expression. FN signaling suppresses in vivo Th1 responses independently of CD8+ splenic cDCs. mixed BM chimeric mice with equal proportions of congenically marked Ifnar1+/+ and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 cDCs. splenic cDC (CD11chiMHCIIhiTCR\u2013B220\u2013 single cells) subsets (CD8+ and CD8\u2013) were assessed by flow cytometry for uptake of FITC+ beads. percentages indicate proportion of each cDC population containing at least one bead. CD8+ cDC\u2013depleted and control langerin-DTR mice were infected with DT. we administered -IFNAR1 or control IgG to DT-treated mice. this had no effect on upregulation of CD86 by CD8\u2013 cDCs or on emerging Th1 response. type I IFN signaling impairs Th1 priming by splenic CD8\u2013 cDCs. we first sort-purified splenic CD8\u2013 cDCs, along with CD8+ cDCs for comparison, from PbA-infected WT and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice. we then loaded WT and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 cDCs ex vivo with OTII peptide. IFN- assessed in tissue culture supernatants after CD4+ OTII cells (3\u20136 replicate wells) were stimulated for 4 days with ex vivo OTII peptide\u2013loaded, cell-sorted, splenic CD8+ and CD8\u2013 cDCs pooled from WT and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice (n = 5\u20136) infected 4 days previously with PbA (data are mean SEM from a single experiment representative of 2). fl/fl mice and Ifnar1fl/fl littermate controls. TEa cells express a T cell receptor specific for an I-Ed-derived peptide. t-bet upregulation was strongest when stimulated with CD8\u2013 cDCs. CD8+ and CD8\u2013 cDCs from PbA-infected CD11c-Cre Ifnar1fl/fl mice and Ifnar1fl/fl littermates revealed that there were modest effects on many molecules, including CD80, CD40, OX40L, and ICOSL. of particular interest, however, was a specific 2- to 3-fold increase in PDL2 expression on CD8\u2013 cDCs, but not CD8+ cDCs mice depleted of CD8+ CD207+ cDCs were protected from lethal neurological disease during PbA infection. langerin-DTR mice were resistant to disease when treated with DT but not saline. DT-treated, langerin-DTR mice given -IFNAR1 showed much improved control of peripheral blood parasitemia compared with control IgG-treated counterparts. cDCs participate in a feed-forward loop that maximizes rapid type I IFN production. we first measured serum IFN- levels in PbA-infected Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice. in both cases, serum IFN- levels were greatly reduced. we also observed substantially lower levels of serum IFN- at day 4 p.i. in CD11c-Cre Ifnar1fl/fl mice. IFN-/ gene expression by qPCR in sorted splenic CD8\u2013 cDCs from pooled WT mice (n = 5) 3 days p.i. with PbA or naive controls. results indicate expression relative to sorted splenic pDCs from pooled WT mice on day 3 p.i. ND. type I IFN signaling suppressed Th1 responses during experimental severe malaria independently of suppressive effects on monocytes. mice were assessed for clinical symptoms from day 5 p.i.. MCs were assessed by flow cytometry for cell surface expression of MHCII on TCR\u2013/B220\u2013/CD11b+/Ly6Chi single cells exhibiting low granularity (2 independent experiments). spleens were assessed for numbers of and cell-surface MHCII expression by, CD11b+ Ly6Chi monocytes and (F) proportion and absolute numbers of CD4+ TCR+ cells producing IFN- without ex vivo restimulation (2 these cells were also more abundant and expressed more cell surface MHCII in the spleens of PbA-infected Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice. this observation was unexpected given that type I IFN promotes, rather than suppresses, monocyte recruitment and activation. however, monocyte recruitment to the spleen and acquisition of cell surface MHCII was abrogated in Ccr2\u2013/\u2013 mice. IFNAR1 genetic deficiency and -IFNAR1 treatment resulted in 50% less CD86 upregulation by cDCs. similar observations were made in Ccr2\u2013/\u2013 mice, devoid of splenic monocyte recruitment. flow cytometric analysis of cell surface CD86 expression on indicated splenic cell types was performed on day 4 p.i. on day 4 p.i., flow cytometric assessment of chimerism and cell surface CD86 expression in splenic CD11chiMHCIIhiTCR\u2013B220\u2013 single cells from WT. Ifnar1+/+ and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 splenic cDC subsets in these animals at 4 days p.i. with PbA. we then assessed CD86 expression by Ifnar1+/+ and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 cDC subsets at 4 days p.i. with PbA. direct type I IFN signaling in cDCs impairs their capacity to prime IFN-producing Th1 cells in vivo. to establish a causal link between type I IFN signaling in cDCs and Th1 suppression, we compared Th1 responses in PbA-infected CD11c-Cre Ifnar1fl/fl mice and Cre\u2013 Ifnar1fl/fl littermate controls. expression of IFN- was increased on a per cell basis in proliferated OTII cells from Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice compared with WT recipient mice. expression of IFN- was again increased on a per cell basis in proliferated OTII cells from Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice. WT mice (n = 5) were infected with PbA or left uninfected. bulk splenic cDCs were assessed by flow cytometry. on day 4 p.i., splenic CD4+TCR+ single cells were assessed for intracellular IFN- expression (performed once) type I IFN signaling suppresses in vivo Th1 responses independently of CD8+ splenic cDCs. we used mixed BM chimeric mice with equal proportions of congenically marked Ifnar1+/+ and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 splenic cDCs. plenic cDC (CD11chiMHCIIhiTCR\u2013B220\u2013 single cells) subsets (CD8+ and CD8\u2013) were assessed by flow cytometry for uptake of FITC+ beads. percentages indicate proportion of each cDC population containing at least one bead. plenic CD8+ CD207+ cDCs by diphtheria toxin (DT) treatment of langerin-DTR mice. CD8+ cDC\u2013depleted and control langerin-DTR mice were infected with PbA and administered -IFNAR1 or control IgG. this had no effect on upregulation of CD86 by CD8\u2013 cDCs or on emerging Th1 response. type I IFN signaling impairs Th1 priming by splenic CD8\u2013 cDCs. we first sort-purified splenic CD8\u2013 cDCs, along with CD8+ cDCs for comparison. given equivalent cell surface expression of MHCII by CD8\u2013 cDCs from infected WT and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice. ex vivo E52-68 peptide-loaded, cell-sorted, splenic CD8+ and CD8\u2013 cDCs pooled from WT and Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice (n = 5\u20136) infected 4 days previously with PbA (data are mean SEM from a single experiment representative of 2). TEa cells express a T cell receptor specific for an I-Ed\u2013derived peptide (E52-68) when presented by MHCII I-Ab molecules (41). TEa T cells significantly upregulated T-bet when stimulated with CD8\u2013 cDCs from infected Ifnar1fl/fl mice. cDCs from CD11c-Cre Ifnar1fl/fl mice and Ifnar1fl/fl littermates revealed that there were modest effects on many molecules, including CD80, CD40, OX40L, and ICOSL. of particular interest was a specific 2- to 3-fold increase in PDL2 expression on CD8\u2013 cDCs, but not CD8+ cDCs, in the absence of cDC-specific type I IFN signaling mice depleted of CD8+ CD207+ cDCs were protected from lethal neurological disease during PbA infection. langerin-DTR mice were resistant to disease when treated with DT but not saline. DT-treated, langerin-DTR mice given -IFNAR1 showed much improved control of peripheral blood parasitemia compared with control IgG-treated counterparts. cDCs participate in a feed-forward loop that maximizes rapid type I IFN production. serum IFN- levels were greatly reduced in pbA-infected Ifnar1\u2013/\u2013 mice. we also observed substantially lower levels of serum IFN- at day 4 p.i. in CD11c-Cre Ifnar1fl/fl mice. we then determined whether these cells in particular might be a source of type I IFNs. CD11c-Cre+ Ifnar1fl/fl mice and Ifnar1fl/fl littermate control mice (pooled from 2 independent experiments) expression relative to sorted splenic pDCs from pooled WT mice on day 3 p.i. ND, not detected. CD8+ cDCs have received greater attention than CD8\u2013 cDCs in many studies in recent years. recent studies highlight the unique ability of CD8+ cDCs to drive immune-pathogenic CD8+ T cell responses during PbA infection. however, in subsequent studies, in which poly I:C treatment reduced Th1 responses during Plasmodium infection, CD8\u2013 cDCs substantially underperformed compared with CD8+ cDCs. these data are consistent with previous studies in which CCR2-expressing cells played little or no role during the first week of infection in controlling blood-stage Plasmodium infection. work using other malaria models suggests that enhancing monocyte and moDC activity via type I IFN blockade could play a beneficial role in persistent and chronic Plasmodium infections. however, while these cells are activated during Plasmodium infection, they do not play a major role in immune cell activation or disease outcome. the functional consequences of increased PDL2 levels on CD8\u2013 cDCs for Th1 priming remain unstudied at present. however, given that PD1/PDL1 interactions potently suppress Th1 responses during experimental malaria (61, 62), we hypothesize that PDL2 disrupts the suppressive interactions between PD1 on Th cells. there is currently no licensed vaccine against Plasmodium. the current best candidate was recently shown to provide only modest, short-lived, protection in phase III clinical trials in Africa.
