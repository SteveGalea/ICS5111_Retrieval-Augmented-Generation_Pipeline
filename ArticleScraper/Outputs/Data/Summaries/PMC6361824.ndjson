POCT is the only one of its kind in the world producing master and doctor of philosophy graduates in POCT. the study was web-based, so it is possible that POCT content was missed during the discovery phase, if taught, disseminated, or demonstrated in classes or electives that were not explicitly listed as search targets. faculty with field experience in POCT applications could teach \u201cHealth Maintenance and non-communicable diseases\u201d (Part IV.) and \u201cCommunicable Diseases\u201d (Part V.) a search using the website of the American Journal of Public Health (https://ajph.aphapublications.org/) returned no articles when using the term \u201cpoint-of-care testing,\u201d although \u201ctesting\u201d per se appeared frequently, mainly with \u201cHIV\u201d a PubMed search for \u201cpublic health curriculum\u201d produced 178 papers, none of which addressed POCT or related topics. however, when PubMed recovered POCT papers, none addressed public health curriculum. extensive free instruction has been conducted over the past decade in lectures and workshops provided by one author (GK) and colleagues worldwide using the curriculum developed for limited-resource nations (9). Table 4 summarizes the topics. this experience was integrated into the recommended public health curriculum presented earlier in Table 3. web-based, so it is possible that POCT content was missed during discovery phase, if taught, disseminated, or demonstrated in classes or electives that were not explicitly listed as search targets. 100% of 59 schools of public health, colleges of public health, and public health schools accredited by the CEPH were accessed and assessed successfully. 100% of the states in the united states with public health educational programs were represented. ifcc.org/ifcc-education-division/emd-committees/taskforcepoct/poctresources/ Literature \u2022 Use PubMed to locate, then read literature on POCT NAS \u2022 \u201cGrand Challenge\u201d for POC devices that detect antimicrobial resistance (NIAID, BARDA), POC technologies centers (NIBIB), and other point-of-need awards.

Participate in community health fairs that promote self-testing for diabetes, HIV, pregnancy, and other communicable diseases. POCT is growing exponentially on a global scale, so the public health field should embrace it to advance public health practice at points of need. some, such as pathologists, have been labeled \u201cinvisible\u201d that is, not providing adequate leadership when it comes to, \"Modern, affordable pathology and laboratory medicine systems\" Spatial Care PathsTM (28\u201330) can be designed to solve specific public health problems and meet demands during infectious disease outbreaks. use of educational documents and focused symposia found at http://www.ifcc.org/ifcc-education-division/emd-committee/taskforcepoct/poctresource/ Literature. online training and boot camps \u2022 Obtain individual AACC certifications in basic and clinical POCT. participate in community health fairs that promote self-testing for diabetes, HIV, pregnancy, and other communicable diseases. academic leaders in china see such strong need for POCT. some, such as pathologists, have been labeled \u201cinvisible\u201d. some, such as pathologists, have been labeled \u201cinvisible\u201d. POCT for infectious diseases is a means for pharmacists and public health professionals to collaboratively combat antibiotic resistance. pharmacists appear amenable to using POC tests (38), including in low- and middle-income settings. future research should assess the potential for nurses, physician assistants, and other professionals to become part of POC-enabled teams. two recent books position public health practitioners as first responders. neither book includes sections on POCT, training for it or didactic curriculum. a case study by C.
