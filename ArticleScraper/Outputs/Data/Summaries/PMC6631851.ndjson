{"summary": "three types of IFNs have been defined based on their molecular signatures. IFN- as a single member of Type II IFN is primarily produced by lymphocytes such as natural killer (NK) cells and activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) type III IFNs consisting of several IFN- isoforms are phylogenically more ancestral and restrictively expressed in epithelial tissues along with their distinct cell receptor. they seem to mediate similar intracellular signaling leading to induction of a plethora of IFN-stimulated genes to combat viral infections. the unconventional IFN subtypes in swine and cattle may evolve functional novelty and act at least partly through non-canonical IFN signaling in immune regulation. the pioneer studies about porcine IFNs (primarily IFN-/) detected the IFN-mediated broad-spectrum antiviral activity in sera, intestinal homogenates, and cell culture supernatants. porcine IFN-mediated antiviral activity should be, at least partially, ascribed to type III IFNs. this is the highest IFN gene number in one species (paralleled by domestic cows) of all animal species studied so far. this is the highest IFN gene number in one species (paralleled by domestic cows) most unconventional subtypes of porcine IFNs including three IFN-s and five subtypes of type I IFNs have not been well examined for their antiviral potency in different viral disease models. IFNA1L has 99\u2013100% sequence identity to IFNA1; dashed line, unassembled piece. 36 or 37 IFN genes are grouped into five clusters separated by four blank interval regions at 60 Kb/each. each cluster contains mingled subtypes of IFNA, IFNW, and IFND. further curation of the 57 functional IFN genes indicates they include 18 potential artifactual or newly evolving duplicates. emergence of multiple pseudogenes, SNPs, and CVN collectively imply a rapid co-evolution of porcine IFN genes to meet increasing need of antiviral pressure against newly emerging pathogenic exposure. jawed fishes (Gnathostomes) as the source of development for ancestral IFN genes [1,2] origin of intronless IFNs through retroposition is an indicator event in IFN evolution and functional diversification. all fish IFN genes are primitive intron-containing which generally have four introns [1,2,39,40] original retroposition event leading to intronless IFNs in amniotes actually occurred earlier in amphibians [8,38,41,42] pigs have the largest (and still expanding) type I IFN family. pigs have the largest (and still expanding) type I IFN family. pigs have the largest (and still expanding) type I IFN family. pigs have the largest (and still expanding) type I IFN family. the major primitive IFN subtypes and even prototypes of multigene IFN subtypes could evolve prior to domestication. we propose that the domestication process should have primarily driven the major IFN gene diversification/selection during the last 9000 years [7,8,17,44]. the discoveries of multiple unconventional IFN subtypes in livestock species have dramatically changed our understanding about IFN biology. these unconventional IFN subtypes include IFN-, -, and \u2013 as well as the type III IFN- that are common in most mammalian species, and species-specific IFN- (pigs), IFN- (cattle & sheep), IFN- (pigs, cattle and horses), and IFN\u2013 (mice) IFN- is a subtype identified so far in cattle, horses, and pigs. previous study revealed that IFN- was moderately expressed in the lymph nodes, spleen, and intestines. how porcine IFN- functions in skin and its coordination with IFN- remain elusive. studies also revealed that different subtypes of IFNs differ in their affinity to either IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 subunit. but unlike IFN-, IFN- can form a high-affinity complex with IFNAR1 contributing to its potency and allowing for IFNAR2-independent IFN- signaling and a distinct ISG profile. type I IFNs are maintained in multiple body sites by instructive signals of commensal bacteria. cell metabolic or stress statuses regulate type I IFN production through key checkpoints including glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3), AMP-kinase (AMPK), and mammalian target of rapamycin. innate immune IFN expression in tissues from 5-week-old healthy pigs showed high expression of multiple IFN subtypes. basal expression of several porcine type I IFNs and IFN-1 was also detected in immune organs (including mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and thymus) the most sensitive virus to both porcine IFN- and \u2013 subtypes was vesicular stomatitis. swinepox, swine influenza, and TGVs were intermediate in their sensitivity to IFN-, porcine parvovirus or porcine rotavirus. porcine type I IFN- subtypes retained the greatest antiviral activity against PRRSV and VSV in porcine and MARC-145 cells. some IFN- and IFN- subtypes differed in their antiviral activity based on target cells and viruses. the antiviral activity of tested IFN- isoforms is positively correlated with induction of an IFN-stimulated gene. IFNK and IFNW correspond to IFN- (IFNA), IFN- (IFNAW), IFN- (IFNB), IFN- (IFND), IFN- (IFNE), IFN- (IFNE), IFN- (IFNK) and IFN-(IFNW) in classic nomenclature for IFN protein precursors. IFN peptides exert various biological activities through induction of hundreds of IFN-stimulated genes. they encode proteins directly cleaving viral genomes, trapping and degrading virions, or indirectly modulating cell immune and metabolic statuses to couple with each stage of the antiviral response. the production of IFN- in plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) relies on mTOR activation. IFN- mediates antiviral signaling through mTOR activation in recipient cells. this critical omission needs to be addressed particularly in livestock species including pigs, cattle, and sheep. the unconventional subtypes and roles of porcine IFNs could confer some functional and signaling novelty beyond that of the well-studied IFN-/ subtypes. investigations into porcine IFN-complex will further our understanding of IFN biology."}
