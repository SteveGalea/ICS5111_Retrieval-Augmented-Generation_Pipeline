{"summary": "at least 10 clades of H5N1 viruses have been identified. a key component in the global strategy to prepare for and control any pending influenza pandemic is the development of an effective vaccine. two immunizations are needed to achieve desired levels of protective immune responses against H5N1. a DNA prime-inactivated vaccine boost is highly effective in eliciting higher protective immune responses than using either DNA or inactivated flu vaccine alone. it may be possible to use DNA vaccines as the first dose of immunization that can be given either long before the pandemic (pre-pandemic vaccination) or shortly after the outbreak. HA antigens from H1 and H3 serotypes had different structure preferences in order to elicit optimal protective antibodies. two of the HA antigen designs used in that study were also included in the current study to identify the optimal design for the H5 serotype HA antigens. transmembrane/cytoplasmic region truncated HA antigens (H5.dTM) with tPA leader sequence. cleavage site between HA1 and HA2 subunits marked. HA genes used in the current study were also codon optimized and chemically synthesized. proteins expressed from two full length H5-HK DNA vaccine constructs (HA-HK.wt and HA-HK.tPA) were detected in cell lysate but not in the supernatant. truncation of the C-terminal segment, including the removal of the TM domain, was able to significantly increase the secretion of HA protein. the HI antibody titers are shown as the geometric means for each group (3 rabbits per group) with standard deviation against H5N1 A/HongKong/483/97 virus. the statistical differences between each testing groups are determined. H5-HK HA DNA vaccines induced protective antibodies against the autologous wild type virus A/HongKong/483/97. differences were statistically significant between H5-HK.tPA and H5-HK.dTM sera based on HI assay. binding antibody responses showed similar levels among sera elicited by the three H5-VN DNA vaccines with different HA gene insert designs. functional antibodies, as measured by HI and MN antibody analyses, revealed again that the H5-VN.tPA design induced the highest levels of functional antibody responses. titers are shown as the geometric means for each group (3 rabbits per group) with standard deviation against H5-VN HA DNA vaccines collected at 2 weeks after the 4th DNA immunization (DNA-4) or relevant pre-bleed sera. titers measured at 50% inhibition (IC90) of virus infection to target cells. data shown are the geometric mean titers of each group with standard deviations. treatment with PNGaseF allowed for removal of N-linked glycosylations. molecular weight reduction patterns for HA0, HA1 and HA2 antigens were the same between cells transfected by these H5-VN HA DNA vaccines. additional HA DNA vaccines with the HA insert design were produced by using codon optimized HA genes that encode the HA proteins from H5N1 viral strains A/Anhui/1/2005 and A/Indonesia/5/2005. a set of experiments was conducted to understand the cross protection between paired H5N1 HA antigens. the H5-VN.tPA DNA vaccine elicited high level HA-specific IgG responses against autologous H5-VN and heterologous H5-HK HA antigens. the overall titers against its autologous H5-VN HA antigen may be higher (not statistically significant) in H5-HK.tPA DNA vaccine-immunized rabbit sera against the autologous virus, A/VN/1203/04, compared to responses observed against the heterologous virus, A/VN/1203/04. similar analysis was conducted with rabbit immune sera elicited by H5-VN and H5-AH HA DNA vaccines. elicited by H5-VN (A/VietNam/1203/2004) and H5-AH (A/Anhui/1/2005) HA DNA vaccines in rabbits immunized with H5-VN-tPA (3 rabbits) and H5-AH-tPA (4 rabbits), respectively, at two weeks after the 4th DNA immunization. HI antibody and NAb titers were detected against wild type H5N1 viruses one alternative approach is to produce a polyvalent HA formulation. rabbit sera elicited by either the 3-valent HA DNA vaccine formulation (H5-VN+H5-AH+H5-IN) or the monovalent H5 HA DNA vaccines (HK, VN, AH, and IN) monovalent rabbit sera consistently showed the highest functional antibody responses against all three pseudotyped viruses. one non-matched monovalent rabbit serum could neutralize one or two viruses but not all three. a polyvalent HA formulation is capable of protect against multiple H5N1 viruses. two of the HA antigen designs used in that study were included in the current study to identify the optimal design for the H5 serotype HA antigens. one used the wild type HA antigen insert (H5.wt), which has the exact same amino acid sequences found in the natural viral isolate. the other used a truncated HA antigen insert (H5.dTM), which removed the transmembrane (TM) and intracellular segments of the HA2 domain HA genes used in the current study express intact HA amino acid sequences at the cleavage site between HA1 and HA2 (PQREXRRKKRG) of HA proteins in highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses [12], [13], [14]. this cleavage was shown to be important for the pathogenesis of H5N1 viruses [12], [13], [14]. truncation of the C-terminal segment, including the removal of the TM domain in the H5-HK.dTM DNA vaccine construct, was able to significantly increase the secretion of HA protein (detected in supernatant) HA proteins expressed by all of three HA DNA vaccine designs were cleaved into HA1 and HA2 subunits. the geometric means for each group (3 rabbits per group) with standard deviations against H5N1 A/HongKong/483/97 virus. the statistical differences between each testing groups are determined and P values less than 0.05 or 0.01 are indicated. the tPA leader sequence (H5-HK.tPA) elicited consistently higher HI and MN antibody titers. the difference was statistically significant (p0.05) between H5-HK.tPA and H5-HK.dTM sera based on the HI assay. functional antibodies, as measured by HI and MN antibody analyses, showed similar levels among sera elicited by the three H5-VN HA DNA vaccines with different HA gene insert designs. the differences between H5-VN.tPA and the other two forms were statistically significant by both HI and MN assays. titers against H5N1 A/VietNam/1203/04 virus infection to MDCK cells are shown as the geometric means from each group (3 rabbits per group) with standard deviation. the statistical differences between each testing groups are determined. HA antigens expressed by different forms of H5-VN HA DNA vaccines are essential for virus infectivity and vaccine immunogenicity. the asn (N)-linked glycosylation of influenza HA proteins are essential for virus infectivity and vaccine immunogenicity [24], [25]. the molecular weight reduction patterns for HA0, HA1 and HA2 species were the same between cells transfected by these HA DNA vaccines. a smaller molecular weight HA2 antigen was observed in cells transfected with the H5-VN.dTM DNA vaccine. a small portion of the HA1 proteins was not fully deglycosylated by PNGaseF treatment. hui/1/2005 and A/Indonesia/5/2005, both have caused human infection in recent years. it would be important to determine if H5 HA vaccines developed based on H5N1 viruses isolated at different epidemic time points can induce cross antibody responses against other H5N1 viruses. HI and MN titers were present in both HK.tPA and H5-VN.tPA DNA vaccine-immunized rabbit sera against both viruses. the overall titers against its autologous H5-VN HA antigen may be higher (not statistically significant) H5-VN.tPA DNA vaccine induced much higher HI and MN responses against its autologous virus, A/VN/1203/04, compared to the heterologous virus, A/HK/483/97 (p0.05). similar analysis was conducted with rabbit immune sera elicited by H5-VN and H5-AH HA DNA vaccines. HI antibody and NAb titers were detected against wild type H5N1 viruses. cross-protection by a polyvalent DNA vaccine formulation expressing HA antigens. rabbit sera elicited by 3-valent HA DNA vaccine formulation. monovalent rabbit sera showed highest antibody responses against autologous pseudotyped viruses. matched monovalent rabbit sera consistently showed highest functional antibody responses. one non-matched monovalent rabbit serum could neutralize one or two viruses but not all three. a polyvalent HA formulation is capable of protecting against multiple H5N1 viruses. a major next-step for H5N1 vaccine research is to determine to what degree the immunity elicited by one clade 0 virus can cross-protect against H5N1 viruses from other clades. a systemic examination on the cross-protection among HA antigens from different clades is needed for strategic planning. the success of the prime-boost strategy has greatly enhanced the utility of DNA vaccination for future human applications [10], [30] at the same time, optimization of the design of antigen inserts based on the uniqueness of each antigen can also play a key role. results included in the current report indicated that the tPA leader sequence and the C-terminal transmembrane domain/cytoplasmic region of H5 HA both contribute to better functional antibody responses in H5.tPA DNA vaccines there is no major detectable level of secreted HA antigens in supernatant for either the WT-design or tPA-design. however, the dTM design did have a higher level of secretion due to the deletion of transmembrane and intracellular portion of HA protein but did not elicit better protective antibody responses. however, there is no major difference between WT-design and tPA-design after de-glycosylation treatment. cross protection among H5N1 viruses can be detected [33], [34], [35]. clade 1 H5N1 vaccines cross protect against both clade 1 and clade 2 (Indonesia) viruses in ferrets with the use of a strong adjuvant [36] cross protection was observed against the late H5 virus from 1997 to 2005. HI titers against heterologous virus (cross-clade) were significantly reduced compared to HI titers against homologous virus in the current study. a HI titer of 140 has been associated with protection. the titers observed in mice may not be the same as in humans. the findings will be very useful in the identification of simple yet powerful approaches to develop vaccines against major influenza pandemics. the less optimal codons in HA genes were changed to the preferred codons in mammalian systems to promote higher expression of the HA proteins, as previously described. the HA natural leader sequence was replaced by a human tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) leader sequence. the individual H5-HK or H5-VN HA gene was cloned downstream of the tPA leader sequence and designated as H5-HK.tPA or H5-VN.tPA DNA vaccine constructs. the truncated H5-HK or H5-VN gene insert was individually cloned into the pSW3891 vector at the NheI and BamHI sites downstream of the tPA leader sequence. each individual DNA vaccine plasmid was prepared from Escherichia coli (HB101 strain) with a Mega purification kit. western blot analysis of in vitro expressed HA antigens. transfected 2106 293T cells at 50% confluence in a 60 mm dish. a total of 3 ml supernatant and 100 l of cell lysate were harvested 72 hours later. HA proteins were first denatured at 100\u00b0C for 10 min in glycoprotein denaturing buffer. after addition of G7 reaction buffer, the deglycosylation enzyme cocktail was added and incubated reaction at 37\u00b0C for 4 hours. either mock-treated or deglycosylated HA samples were subject to SDS-PAGE. jugated streptavidin (Vector Laboratories) diluted at 12000 in Whey buffer was added to each well and incubated for 1 hour. the plates were developed with 3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032 Tetramethybenzidine (TMB) solution at 100 l per well. the reactions were stopped by adding 25 l of 2 M H2SO4. the HI titer was defined as the highest dilution of serum that neutralized 100 TCID50 of virus in MDCK cell cultures. the recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene were produced as previously described. supernatants were harvested 48 hours later, frozen at 80\u00b0C. for neutralization assays, serum samples (5 l) were heat inactivated at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes. after incubation, 293A cells were trypsinized and added to each plate at a dilution of 1104 cells per well. three versions of codon optimized HA gene inserts were cloned into DNA vaccine vector pSW3891 [43] for either H5-HK or H5-VN HA DNA vaccines. the individual H5-HK or H5-VN HA gene inserts were subcloned into the pSW3891 vector at the PstI and BamHI sites downstream of the tPA leader sequence. the truncated H5-HK or H5-VN HA gene insert was individually cloned into the pSW3891 vector downstream of the tPA leader sequence. each individual DNA vaccine plasmid was prepared from Escherichia coli (HB101 strain) with a Mega purification kit. DNA immunizations were given at weeks 0, 2, 4, 8. serum samples were taken prior to the first immunization. all surgery was performed under sodium pentobarbital anaesthesia. the signals were detected using a chemiluminescence-based Western-Light Kit (Tropix, Bedford, MA) deglycosylation of H5 HA antigens. the HA proteins were first denatured at 100\u00b0C for 10 min in glycoprotein denaturing buffer and then chilled on ice. 100 l of serially diluted rabbit or mouse serum was added in duplicate wells. after another set of washes, the plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. after another set of washes, the plates were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C. the 50% egg infectious dose (EID50) for each virus stock was calculated by the method of Reed and Muench. all experiments with HPAI viruses were conducted under Biosafety Level 3 containment. the assay was performed using, 0.5% v/v fowl or horse [30] red blood cells. recombinant lentiviral vectors expressing a luciferase reporter gene were produced as previously described [28], [54], [55]. to produce H5N1 pseudotyped viruses, 293T cells [45], [46] were transfected with 13.43 g of pNL 4-3.Luc.R-E- (NIH AIDS reference and reagent program) blot analysis of potential N-linked glycosylations of HA protein expressed by differently designed H5-VN (A/VietNam/1204/04) DNA vaccines. blot analysis of potential N-linked glycosylations of HA protein."}
