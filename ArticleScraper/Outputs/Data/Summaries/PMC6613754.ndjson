{"summary": "the murine coronavirus, mouse hepatitis virus, is widely used as a model system to study coronavirus replication and pathogenesis in mice. the large (32-kb) viral genomic RNA is translated to produce two long polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1-16, Fig. 1A) the viral replication complex generates a nested set of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) intermediates to produce copious amounts of mRNAs. the genomic RNA and structural proteins assemble in the ER-Golgi intermediate compartment to generate infectious virus particles that are released from the cell (5, 6). culture supernatants were collected at the indicated hours postinfection. the data are representative of two independent experiments. Error bars indicate the standard deviation (SD) ADRP activity was not essential for coV replication in cultured cells. but further studies revealed that an ADRP-catalytic mutant virus was attenuated in mice (20) and that ADRP activity in SARS-CoV and human CoV-229E mediated resistance to antiviral interferon responses (21) breakthrough came in 2016 from a study revealing that the macrodomain of HEV acts as an ADP-ribose hydrolase (22). tsNC11 was generated by chemical mutagenesis, plaque purified, and validated as a temperature-sensitive mutant defective in positive-sense RNA synthesis at nonpermissive temperatures. tsNC11 harbors mutations in the open reading frame 1a (ORF1a) region of the replicase polyprotein, but the specific mutations were unknown. the sequence analysis revealed seven nonsynonymous substitutions in ORF1a of tsNC11. these substitutions resulted in 7 amino acid (aa) changes. two in nsp2 (I4V and T543I), four in nsp3 and one in nsp10 (P23S) icWT replicates to high titer at all three temperatures, whereas tsNC11 is impaired at both 37 and 40\u00b0C. tsNC11 is profoundly temperature sensitive, with a low number of plaques detected at 101 dilution on the plate incubated at the nonpermissive temperature. analysis of the MACmut virus revealed a mixed population of small and large plaques at the nonpermissive temperature, the majority of which displayed the small-plaque phenotype. the MACmut virus, but not the PLP2mut or icWT viruses, has a defect in plaque formation at the nonpermissive temperature. a subpopulation of large plaques was present at 40\u00b0C. small-plaque isolates recapitulated the phenotype of the parental MACmut virus. small-plaque isolates had no additional mutations in either the macrodomain or PLP2. isolates 4 to 7 maintained the engineered mutations but had also acquired additional, potentially suppressive mutations in the downstream region. we also evaluated the MAC-PLP2 region of tsNC11 large-plaque revertant viruses and found that all three isolates had the D554-to-G reversion. the MAC/PLP2mut virus exhibits a severe replication defect at 37 and 40\u00b0C and replicated only under permissive conditions. the low titer of the MAC/PLP2mut virus at 40\u00b0C indicates a low level of reversion to the wild-type phenotype, suggesting that the PLP2 mutations stabilize the MACmut virus. expression of both macrodomain and PLP2 was detected by cognate epitope antibodies. hek-293T cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-V5, and inversely, PLP2-V5 was detected when HA-MAC was immunoprecipitated from the lysates. these results indicate that the ectopically expressed macrodomain associates with PLP2 in cell lysates, consistent with either a direct or indirect interaction. HEK-293T cells were transfected with the indicated expression plasmid of wild-type (WT) or mutant forms of MAC-PLP2. at 16 h posttransfection, cells were treated with 20 g/ml of CHX or a combination of 20 g/ml of CHX or a combination of 20 g/ml CHX and 10 M MG132. blots (B) and curves of relative intensities (C) were evaluated using nonlinear regression and two-sided t tests in comparison to WT. we infected cells with either icMHV-WT or MAC/PLP2mut virus and incubated them at the permissive temperature for 9.5 h. nsp2-3 and nsp3 proteins detected after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature. arrowhead indicates detections of cellular protein in all lysates. ts mutant viruses induce interferon in macrophages. the MAC/PLP2mut virus exhibited the most robust IFN- response. the level of N gene expression was similar. mutations in the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain result in elevated levels of type I IFN mRNA expression during infection of macrophages. ts mutant viruses reduced replication efficiency and elicited type I IFN production during infection of macrophages. ts mutant viruses are attenuated in vivo and can modulate viral pathogenesis. tsNC11 harbors mutations in the open reading frame 1a region of the replicase polyprotein, but the specific mutations were unknown. the mutations within nsp3 are distributed between the macrodomain (K532E and G554D) and the PLP2 domain (D1026N and D1071N) three mutant viruses were generated using the MHV-A59 reverse genetics system (37) to evaluate the contributions of the macrodomain and PLP2 domain mutations to the ts phenotype. icWT replicates to high titer at all three temperatures, whereas tsNC11 is impaired at both 37 and 40\u00b0C. analysis of the three engineered mutants revealed that the two substitutions in the PLP2 domain were not sufficient to confer a temperature-sensitive phenotype. the MACmut virus exhibited reduced virus replication at 40\u00b0C but was only slightly impaired at 37\u00b0C. MAC/PLP2 mutant virus mirrored the plaque size and plating efficiency of tsNC11. we calculated the EOP values, which represent the ratio of viral titers obtained at 40\u00b0C and 32\u00b0C. however, the MACmut virus exhibited titers that were significantly lower at 40\u00b0C than the titers obtained at 32\u00b0C. small-plaque isolates recapitulated the phenotype of the parental MACmut virus. small-plaque isolates had no additional mutations in either the macrodomain or the PLP2 domain. a subpopulation of large plaques was also present at 40\u00b0C. MACmut isolates with distinct plaque sizes were evaluated for a ts phenotype. mutations in PLP2 enhance the ts phenotype by reducing reversion frequency. the MACmut virus did not completely phenocopy tsNC11. the MAC/PLP2mut and tsNC11 viruses exhibit a severe replication defect at 37 and 40\u00b0C. the low titer of the MAC/PLP2mut virus at 40\u00b0C indicates a low level of reversion to the wild-type phenotype. this suggests that the PLP2 mutations stabilize the MACmut virus. detected HA-MAC in lysates immunoprecipitated with anti-V5. inversely, PLP2-V5 was detected when HA-MAC was immunoprecipitated from the lysates. these results indicate that the ectopically expressed macrodomain associates with PLP2 in cell lysates. western blotting was used to detect wild-type or mutant forms of MAC-PLP2 polypeptide in the presence of CHX or a combination of 20 g/ml of CHX and 10 M MG132. at 16 h posttransfection, cells were treated with 20 g/ml of CHX or a combination of 20 g/ml of CHX and 10 M MG132 and then harvested at the indicated time points. we infected cells with either icMHV-WT or MAC/PLP2mut virus. we incubated them at the permissive temperature for 9.5 h. at this point, we added CHX to block translation. cell lysates were collected every 30 min and evaluated using immunoblotting. Western blot evaluating the level of nsp2-3 and nsp3 proteins detected after a shift to the nonpermissive temperature. the asterisk indicates degradation products detected by anti-nsp2-3 antibody in the MAC/PLP2mut virus-infected cells. MAC/PLP2mut virus exhibited the most robust IFN- response. the level of N gene expression was similar. mutations in the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain result in elevated levels of type I IFN mRNA expression during infection of macrophages. mice were inoculated with 600 PFU of virus and monitored for weight loss and mortality. ts mutant viruses are attenuated in vivo. mutations adjacent to catalytic sites of macrodomains and PLP2 domains can modulate viral pathogenesis. the macrodomain and papain-like protease 2 domain reside within the same nsp3 polypeptide. this is consistent with either a direct or indirect interaction. mutations identified in the macrodomain and PLP2 domain destabilize the proteins, as revealed by proteasome-dependent degradation. catalytic activity is not required for virus replication in interferon-nonresponsive cell lines. but catalytic activity is important for replication in primary cells and in mice. identifying the ribosylated substrates that are targeted by the viral enzymatic activity is an important future direction for this work. the removal of posttranslational modifications such as ADP-ribosylation and polyubiquitination could be directed at cellular proteins either to redirect them for use during viral replication or to subvert signaling of innate immune responses. structural and biochemical studies will be needed to fully investigate the multiple cis and trans interactions of nsp3. a detailed understanding of the relationship between the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain will require further structural and enzymatic studies. a detailed understanding of the relationship between the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain will require further structural and enzymatic studies. a total of 195,824 sequences with a mean coverage of 898.8 were aligned to the MHV synthetic construct template. polymorphisms were detected using the \u201cfind variations/SNPs\u201d tool. all infectious clones were generated using the reverse genetics system previously established for MHV-A59 (37). mutations identified by deep sequencing within the macrodomain and PLP2 domain were introduced into plasmids A and B. DNA fragments were ligated together and used for in vitro transcription of viral RNA. one plate was incubated at 32\u00b0C for 60 h. the second plate was incubated at 40\u00b0C for 48 h. titers were calculated to evaluate the kinetics of virus replication. pCAGGS-PLP2 plasmid (PLP2-V5) was inserted into pcDNA3.1. pMP-GD (G554D), pMP-2DN (D1026N/D1071N) and pMP-GD/2DN (G554D/D1026N/D1071N), all contain a C-terminal V5 tag. plasmids were cotransfected into HEK-293T cells in orthovanadate, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 200 g of whole-cell lysates were used for immunoprecipitation with 1 g of primary mouse anti-V5 or anti-HA. the beads were washed three times with wash buffer, followed by 1 h of incubation. the intensities of MAC/PLP2 bands relative to that of -actin were measured and calculated with AlphaView software. to assess the rates of decay of the protein amounts over time for the four viral protein types, we fit the two-parameter simple exponential nonlinear regression function. the membrane was incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of rabbit polyclonal anti-nsp2-3 antibody (anti-D3) (58), followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG(H+L) the membrane was stripped and reprobed using a 1:2,000 dilution of mouse anti-calnexin antibody and then developed as described above. the thermocycler was set as follows: one step at 95\u00b0C (10 min), 40 cycles at 95\u00b0C (15 s) and 60\u00b0C (1 min), and a melt curve from 65 to 95\u00b0C at increments of 0.5\u00b0C/0.05 s. samples were evaluated in triplicate, and data are representative of three independent experiments. 5% heat-inactivated FBS (Atlanta Biological), 2% penicillin-streptomycin (pen/strep; HyClone) and 2% l-glutamine. differentiated BMDMs were maintained in bone marrow macrophage medium. a total of 195,824 sequences with a mean coverage of 898.8 were aligned to the MHV synthetic construct template. the maximum variant P value was set at 106, and the minimum strand bias P value was set at 105 when exceeding 65% bias. the efficiency of plating (EOP; titer at 40\u00b0C/titer at 32\u00b0C) of each virus was measured. each viral stock supernatant was serially diluted and inoculated onto the DBT cells. after 1 h of incubation, the inoculum was removed, and cells were overlaid with a 0.8% 2 MEM\u2013agar mixture. a genomic region (nucleotides 3976 to 6101) containing the macrodomain and the PLP2 domain was amplified by PCR using specific primers (sense, 5\u2032-CAA GAA AGG TCT TTA GGG CTT-3\u2032; antisense, 5\u2032-GAC ACC AAC CTT AAA TG-3\u2032) the PCR products were sequenced, and the sequencing results were compared to the tsNC11 sequence. cells were harvested using 500 l of lysis buffer (20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM -glycerophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 g/ml leupeptin, 1 mM phenylmethylsul 0.5 g of the specified plasmid DNA was transfected into HEK-293T cells. the cells were treated with 20 g/ml of cycloheximide (CHX; 5087390001; Sigma-Aldrich) or a combination of 20 g/ml of cycloheximide. whole-cell lysates were prepared at 30-min intervals by the addition of lysis buffer A (4% SDS, 3% dithiothreitol, 40% glycerol, and 0.065 M Tris [pH 6.8]) the membrane was incubated with a 1:2,000 dilution of mouse anti-calnexin antibody, followed by horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-rabbit IgG qPCR was performed with specific primers for mouse IFN-11 (PPM03050B-200; Qiagen), mouse -actin (PPM02945B-200; Qiagen) or the MHV-A59 N gene (sense, 5\u2032-AGC AGA CTA CTC AAC CCA ACT C-3\u2032; anti-sense, 5\u2032-GCA ATA GGC ACT CCT TGT CCT TCT GCA-3\u2032) monitored daily for changes in body weight. infected mice were euthanized when weight loss was >25%."}
