{"summary": "self-assembling protein nanoparticle Self-assembly is one of the mechanisms used by nature to foster the creation of diverse architectures. spherical viruses usually have a protective protein shell (capsid or nucleocapsid) that is formed from its constituent protein building blocks by such a process. some of these viruses do not require more than one type of capsid protein to fully encase their nucleic acid genome. the monomer encodes an N-terminal pentamer (green), which aligns along the fivefold symmetry axis, and a C-terminal trimer (blue) the monomer\u2019s domains allow a geometric fit along the symmetry axes of the five- and threefold rotational symmetry axes of an icosahedron or a dodecahedron. we will consider spherical particles formed with any kind of three-dimensional (3D) symmetry axes. we also discuss how our approach could be generalized to model nonspherical morphologies. the self-assembly of these domains is governed by a combination of hydrophobic and ionic interactions present within the individual coiled-coil domains. self-assembling protein nanoparticle Self-assembly is one of the mechanisms used by nature to foster the creation of diverse architectures from a limited toolset of building blocks. spherical viruses usually have a protective protein shell (capsid or nucleocapsid) that is formed from its constituent protein building blocks by such a process (1, 2, 3) the monomeric building blocks depend on the presence of two oligomerization domains in a single protein chain. one of which forms a pentameric coiled-coil domain and the other a trimeric coiled-coil domain. the individual coiled-coil domains form long and thin. spherical particles formed with any kind of three-dimensional (3D) symmetry axes are governed by hydrophobic and ionic interactions present within the individual coiled-coil domains. the self-assembly of these domains is governed by the combination of hydrophobic and ionic interactions present within the individual coiled-coil domains. spherical particles with well-defined, highly regular structures could potentially be used in nanotechnology applications. DNA strands encoding the protein sequences for SAPN-K and SAPN-R were obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA) the supernatant was decanted and placed in nickel-NTA beads at room temperature overnight. the supernatant/nickel-NTA slurry was then used to fill a column for purification. 20 mM sodium citrate replaced the 10 mM Tris in all buffers. the nanoparticles in 0 M urea buffer were filtered through a 0.1 m filter (Millipore) the nanoparticles were at a concentration of 400 g/mL in 20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. the grid was then blotted, washed on eight drops of quartz double-distilled water, blotting between each step, and plunge-frozen in liquid nitrogen. the digital images were evaluated using the program package MASDET (20) the results were scaled according to the mass per length measured for tobacco mosaic virus, corrected for beam-induced mass-loss (21), binned into histograms and described by Gaussian curves. a polydisperse spherical shell (PSS) model was proposed to be used as P(q), while the SAPN is presumably dilute enough. the PSS model describes hollow spheres with a constant shell thickness of t and a polydisperse core whose average radius is Ri. the inner radius, Ri, follows the Schultz distribution function, f(Ri) as expressed in Eq. 2, where p is the polydispersity of Ri. f ( R i ) = p 2 p 2 R i ( 1 p 2 ) ( R i R i ) 1 p 2 p 2. This morphology is depicted later in Fig. 4 B. sphericity of the nanoparticle SAPN-R in a buffer containing 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 450 mM Urea, and 5% glycerol. samples were prepared with a 95% D2O to 5% H2O ratio. dynamic light scattering The refolded protein (SAPN-R) was characterized at three different concentrations by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Malvern Zetasizer Nano S (Worcestershire, UK) an average of five DLS readings was obtained over a period of 10 min per run. oligonucleotides were transformed into a pPEP-T plasmid vector. the cells were incubated at 37\u00b0C in Luria broth containing the antibiotics, ampicillin (100 g/mL) and chloramphenicol (34 g/mL) the cells were then decanted and centrifuged for 10 min at 4000 g. purified fractions were filtered using a 0.1 m polyvinylidene fluoride membrane. SAPN-R was placed in a buffer containing 8 M urea, 150 mM NaCl, and 20 mM HEPES, at pH 7.5. stepwise dialysis was performed to remove the urea. tobacco mosaic virus particles were used as a mass standard. they were adsorbed to separate STEM grids, washed on 8 drops of 100 mM bicarbonate, and air-dried. small angle neutron scattering (SANS) experiment was performed at 30 m NG3-SANS. the scattered neutron intensity was obtained as a function of scattering vector, q, defined as ( 4 / ) sin ( / 2 ), where and are the neutron wavelength and scattering angle. the PSS model describes hollow spheres with a constant shell thickness of t and a polydisperse core whose average radius is Ri. the inner radius, Ri, follows the Schultz distribution function, f(Ri) as expressed in Eq. 2, where p is the polydispersity of Ri, defined by R / R i. t is the thickness of the shell layer, and c and s represent the neutron scattering length density of the core and the shell, respectively. the solvent scattering length density (solv) is considered to be the same as c. SAPN-R protein in 9 M urea, 20 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, at pH of 7.5, was concentrated up to an approximate concentration of 1 mg/mL by centrifugation. the concentrated protein was then diluted 20-fold to a concentration of 0.05 mg/mL. the final protein concentration was determined by UV absorption at 280 nm. SAPN systems Higher order SAPNs were generated from two different species, SAPN-K (during STEM runs), and SAPN-R (during SANS, DLS, and TEM runs) for the purpose of this study, the two species can be considered as virtually identical, because they differ only by a single point mutation to a very similar amino acid in the respective monomers. the flexible linker region demarcates the separation of the pentamer encoding domain from the trimer encoding one a quantitative measure of particle heterogeneity was obtained by STEM. the single molecule mass measurement technique calculated the mass of freeze-dried unstained single particles (molecules) from their electron scattering power. each mass value is directly linked to the projected image of the particular particle. spherical shell morphologies cease to exist for larger chains. higher mass values (>5.6 MDa) in the histogram arose from some higher order molecular-weight malformations and asymmetric aggregates (possibly tubular in nature) the SANS data were best fitted using the PSS model (Fig. 4 B) the three samples with different SAPN-R concentrations were best fitted to this model. the overall diameter of the SAPN-R is 240 (i.e., 24 nm) the peak widths measured for the three protein formulations were 32.97 nm (0.119 mg/mL), 33.58 nm (0.289 mg/mL) and 32.80 nm (0.435 mg/mL) the electron microscopy showed the effects of increased concentration, with higher particle density per respective grid. the combined results from the DLS, TEM, STEM, and SANS experiments suggest that SAPN species with up to 360 chains follow a spherical core- a 360-chain SAPN is shown in comparison to the all-pentamer scaffold used in viral tiling theory. putative trimer locations of the SAPN are superimposed as blue dots. the 12 icosahedral fivefold symmetry axes are shown in gold, while the pentameric vertices proposed by viral tiling theory are in cyan. the icosahedral packing geometry described in Caspar and Klug (3) does not adequately explain species of SAPNs that are larger than 60 chains. a classification scheme allows us to determine the architectures of the spherical SAPN particles with more than 60 oligomers, focusing on particles corresponding to the lowest three peaks. connectivity All SAPN particles have the property of being formed entirely from pentagonal and triangular clusters. by construction, the graph is bipartite with two types of vertices, one with degree three (corresponding to trimers) and one with degree five (corresponding to pentamers) the corresponding SAPNs are obtained by fitting the monomeric chains into the graph-theoretical models. the corresponding SAPNs are obtained by fitting the monomeric chains into the graph-theoretical models. the two options with the smallest numbers of vertices are rhomb-shaped and hexagonal faces. larger faces would impose a larger disparity in angles between the individual monomers within the same cluster. we are looking for particle morphologies in which pentamers are uniformly distributed. octahedral, icosahedral, and icosahedral have 12, 24, and 60 asymmetric units. pd is the number of pentagonal clusters and td the number of triangular clusters in the interior of the asymmetric unit. = 120 p d, where in 0,1 indicates whether trimeric clusters are situated on the particle threefold axes. in particular, this implies the condition + + 3 t d = 5 p d, in 0, 1. as a consequence, only the following chain numbers are possible for tetrahedral SAPN particles with up to 360 chains. if a certain chain number N occurs for different symmetries, it is likely that the higher order symmetry is realized by the particle. first, we place the pentameric clusters onto a hexagonal tiling, which guarantees uniform spacing between the clusters. then, depending on the symmetry, we superimpose onto this lattice the planar development of one of the three polyhedra with maximal symmetry. each hexagon of the tiling represents a hexamer, and thus contains six proteins. if p is the number of lattice points not lying at vertices of the triangles, then 6p is the total number of proteins contributed by hexamers. in the tetrahedral case, there are six corners corresponding to axes of order 4. we must associate three proteins to each corner, obtaining 4 3 = 12 = ord(G) proteins. the analog of the counting rule is now ( 6 / 5 ) N + ord ( G ) = ( h 2 + h k + k 2 ) ord ( G ) where h and k are integers. trimers are placed on five of the six vertices of the hexagonal grid surrounding each pentamer. the rhombic and hexagonal tiles generated in this way correspond to the numbers determined above. they are therefore candidates for symmetric particles, and we investigate their possible blueprints. 240 chains are organized as 48 pentamers and 80 trimers. the second mass peak represents 312 chains (plus or minus 30 chains) the graph has 16 hexagonal faces and 126 rhombic faces. the graph-theoretical approach introduced here allows one to determine the connectivity of all possible nondefective arrangements of polypeptides. the graph associated to the particle has 17 hexagonal faces and 132 rhombic faces. such particles would have a nonuniform curvature, and would occur only if the flexible regions of oligomers are highly deformable. the flexible linker region demarcates the separation of the pentamer encoding domain from the trimer encoding one. the linker region might also have considerable influence on the formation of higher order oligomers, its flexibility allowing the addition of extra monomers (through compaction) into any given particle. the results in Fig. 3 C show that the measured particles maintain a high degree of circularity until a size of 360 chains. the data imply that there is a molecular-weight cutoff for the formation of spherical particles. spherical particles are candidates for geometries in which domains are aligned along rotational symmetry axes, such as those of icosahedral symmetry. the spherical particles are candidates for geometries in which domains are aligned along rotational symmetry axes. the model does not describe the SANS data sufficiently well at q 0.007 1 for the lowest concentration (0.119 mg/mL, Fig. 4 A), presumably due to large aggregates that dominate the intensity contribution in this q range. the overall diameter of the SAPN-R is 240 (i.e., 24 nm) two oligomerizing domains have the ability to assemble into oligomers known as least common multiple (LCM) subunits. this 15-monomer threshold is required to allow each building block to participate in precisely one three- and one fivefold cluster. the properties of the resulting nanoparticle could be tuned according to the amino acid sequence present in each oligomerization domain. the 12 icosahedral fivefold symmetry axes are shown in gold, while the pentameric vertices proposed by viral tiling theory are in cyan. the trimeric locations are equivalent to the vertices of a T = 7d icosadeltahedral particle in Caspar-Klug theory. we introduce a classification scheme that allows us to determine the architectures of the spherical SAPN particles with more than 60 oligomers. we focus on particles of maximum symmetry (tetrahedral, octahedral, and icosahedral) because they tend to aggregate in pentamers and trimers. the graph is characterized by the fact that degree-3 vertices must always be connected with degree-5 vertices and vice versa. the graph is characterized by the fact that degree-3 vertices must always be connected with degree-5 vertices. each edge represents a SAPN chain, so e equals the overall number of chains (N) in the particle. the number of chains in any SAPN particle must be a multiple of 15, i.e., a so-called LCM unit. the case m = 4 corresponds to a unique graph, which is the graph of an icosahedrally symmetric polyhedron, the rhombic triacontahedron. it is a polyhedron with 30 rhombic faces, 60 edges, 12 fivefold vertices, and 20 threefold vertices. in 0,1 indicates whether there are trimers on the threefold axes of icosahedral symmetry ( = 1) or not ( = 0), and in 0,1 indicates whether there are pentamers on the fivefold axes of icosahedral symmetry ( = 1) or not ( = 0) as a consequence, only the following chain numbers are possible for octahedral SAPN particles with up to 360 chains. tetrahedral SAPN particles have up to 360 chains. in 0,1 indicates whether there are trimeric clusters on the threefold sites. in 0,1 indicates whether there are trimers on the threefold sites. axes of icosahedral symmetry ( =1) or not ( = 0), and in 0,1 indicates whether there are pentamers on the fivefold axes of icosahedral symmetry ( = 1) or not ( = 0) as a consequence, only the following chain numbers are possible for octahedral SAPN particles with up to 360 chains. indicate if there are trimeric clusters on the two types of threefold sites. this implies the condition + + 3 t d = 5 p d, in 0, 1. each triangle is made of three copies of the asymmetric unit of the corresponding symmetry group. a 3D representation of the particle is then obtained by folding these planar developments into a 3D polyhedron, projecting it onto a sphere, and deforming the corresponding spherical graph to recover uniform spacing. each hexagon of the tiling represents a hexamer, and thus contains six proteins. the icosahedral Caspar-Klug counting rule is now 6 p + ord ( G ) = ( h 2 + h k + k 2 ) ord ( G ). in the tetrahedral and octahedral cases, p = N/5 is the number of pentamers, corresponding to the total number of lattice points positioned at the centers. the geometric interpretation of h and k is as in Caspar and Klug\u2019s approach. for each particle with chain number N we determine h and k. we then draw the corresponding equilateral triangle on a hexagonal grid. we then place trimers on five of the six vertices of the hexagonal grid surrounding each pentamer. it is a 240-chain particle with either tetrahedral or octahedral symmetry. it must correspond to a tessellation with 102 rhombs and 12 hexagons with tetrahedral symmetry. it can be modeled via a hexagonal grid and an equilateral triangle. tetrahedral particles corresponding to peak 3 This peak, 367 chains (plus or minus 30 chains), can be attributed to an icosahedral SAPN species formed from 360 chains. the counting rule yields h 2 + h k + k 2 = 7. oligomerization domains are the only factors limiting the assembly of non-epitope-bearing SAPN species. this means that a matching rule exists, restricting the particle formation to include a packing geometry that has to account for the presence of pentameric and trimeric vertices. these species do indeed exist as pseudo-spheres, so that we can restrict the analysis to particles with maximal symmetry. the majority of the particles, arose from SAPNs with essentially circular projections. some elongation or aggregation occurred at higher molecular weights beyond 360 chains. spherical core-shell morphologies were determined using symmetry techniques and surface lattices. three juxtaposed rhombs highlight a global threefold (trimeric) axis. five adjacent kites mark the positions of the global fivefold axes (pentamers) local fivefold symmetry occurs at the intersection of two kites and three rhombs. tetrahedral particles with 120 and 180 chains can potentially be formed with this assembly system. the SAPN-K species used in this study should be a more accurate reflection of the assembly tendencies of covalently linked pentamer and trimer oligomerization domains. larger molecular weight species, beyond 360 chains, appear to be aggregates of lower species, suggesting that formation of larger spherical particles is energetically unfavorable. electron microscopy and small angle neutron scattering show that these species do indeed mainly exist as pseudo-spheres. the necessity for symmetry is based on the fact that SAPNs consist of homo-oligomers, which ideally align in an equidistant manner, resulting in a (nearly) uniform distribution of pentamers. the 360-chain particle displays icosahedral symmetry. it can be described by an alternative technique related to that used for the modeling of the all-pentamer viral capsids of polyoma virus, papilloma virus, and Simian virus 40 (32, 33, 34). in these cases the positions of the pentamers were determined with reference to a T = 7d icosadeltahedral geometry, but in the case of the SAP both of the SAPN species were measured in the presence of 5% glycerol. it is hard to determine the influence of confounding factors such as epitopes or cosolutes (e.g., glycerol) on native self-assembly equilibrium. the results provided, to our knowledge, new insights into the structures of the nanoparticles formed on the self-assembly of the SAPN system. authors read and modified the text and approved the final manuscript."}
