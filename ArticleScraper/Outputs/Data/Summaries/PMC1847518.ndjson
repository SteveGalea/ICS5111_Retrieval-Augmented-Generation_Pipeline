{"summary": "the SLC11A1 gene has been studied extensively for genetic association with TB, but with inconsistent findings. no study has yet looked into the effect of sex and age on the relationship between SLC11A1 polymorphisms and TB. TB is the worldwide leading cause of morbidity and mortality due to the infection with mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) TB remains prevalent and is still a leading cause of death due to infectious diseases in the past decade. only 10% of individuals infected with MTB develop clinical disease. the protein is strongly believed to act as a transporter of divalent cations. the regulation of Fe2+ level in the microenvironment of the phagosome is important for the control of MTB. both the human host and the bacterium compete for iron in favour of effective immunity and establishing infection. association results indicate either the direct effect of the SLC11A1 gene itself on the disease of interest or some other nearby genes because of the LD phenomenon [28] a marker (IL8rb) in the IL8RB locus at least 220 kb upstream of SLC11A1 is in significant and strong LD with 5' SLC11A1 markers. the IL8RB gene encodes one of the receptors for interleukin-8 and is expressed in neutrophils. samples from unrelated patients with proven pulmonary TB were collected from three different local hospitals. all these cases were ethnic Chinese patients with proven pulmonary TB diagnosed by positive culture results of mainly sputum and very occasionally bronchial aspirates or washings. positive culture results were confirmed by a nucleic acid-based assay. LC6a/b and IL8rb were genotyped by the technique of single strand conformation polymorphism. SLC1 is a microsatellite marker and was genotyped by both fragment analysis on an ABI PRISM 310 Genetic Analyzer. blood samples were also collected from 282 unrelated Chinese individuals. the majority of samples were from healthy blood donors. allele and genotype frequencies of cases and controls were compared using 2 test to investigate the association between genetic markers and TB. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were also calculated to show the effect size. 78 (14%) 71 (13%) 1.13 (0.80 \u2013 1.60) 0.4780 SLC6a/bb G-TGTG 462 (83%) 497 (88%) 1 A- ---- 94 (17%) 67 (12%) 1.51 (1.08 \u2013 2.12) 0.0165c IL8rb C 370 (67%) 395 (70%) 1 T 186 (33%) 169 (30%) 1.18 (0.91 \u2013 1.51) 0.2096 Comparison of the odds ratio for the minor allele A- ---- was 1.51 (95% confidence intervals [CI], 1.08 \u2013 2.12) genotypes with at least one copy of the allele A- ---- had a combined OR of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.09 \u2013 2.32) the combined OR of 1.59 was determined. the differences between TBP and TBC in the female group and the younger age group still remained significant after correction for multiple testing (n = 8) by FDR at a level of 0.05. it was worth noting that the mean age (in years) remained the same with or without stratification by sex. frequenciesc Stratification by sex Male G-TGTG/G-TGTG 149 (72%) 161 (77%) 1 A- ----/- 58 (28%) 48 (23%) 1.31 (0.84 \u2013 2.03) 0.2370 Female G-TGTG/G-TG 43 (61%) 59 (81%) 1 A- ----/- 28 (39%) 14 (19%) 2.74 (1.29 \u2013 5.82) 0.0075b Stratification by age 65 G- sex and age Male & age 65 G-TGTG 151 (89%) 163 (95%) 1 A- ---- 19 (11%) 9 (5%) 2.28 (1.00 \u2013 5.13) 0.0450b Female & age 65 G-TGTG 47 (78%) 55 (92%) 1 A- ---- 13 (22%) 5 (8%) 3.04 (1.01 \u2013 9.16) 0.0408b Male & age >65 G-TGTG 201 (82%) 203 (83 c The genotype A- ---- stands for either A- ----/G-TGTG or A- ----/A-----. both groups had the same proportion of each sex (74% male) both groups had the same mean age (65 years old) with very similar standard deviations (18.4 years for TBP and 18.2 years for TBC) a \"Others\" represent the minor alleles (GT)10 and (GT)11 of the marker SLC1. b Markers SLC6a and SLC6b are in perfect LD and thus are analyzed as a single marker (SLC6a/b) the adjusted cut-off P value is 0.0167 for six comparisons. genotypes with at least one copy of the allele A- ---- had a combined OR of 1.59 (95% CI, 1.09 \u2013 2.32) since genotypes G-TGTG/A- ---- and A- ----/A- ---- gave similar ORs (1.57 and 1.83) and homozygotes A- ----/A- ---- were only found in small numbers in both groups, the combined OR of 1.59 was determined. the proportions of male subjects remained the same with or without stratification by age. with stratification by age, the mean age (in years) was 46.9 for young TBP, 47.0 for young TBC, 77.7 for old TBP and 77.6 for old TBC. with stratification by age, the mean age (in years) was 46.9 for young TBP, 47.0 for young TBC, 77.7 for old TBP and 77.6 for old TBC 43 (61%) 59 (81%) 1 A- ----/- 28 (39%) 14 (19%) 2.74 (1.29 \u2013 5.82) 0.0075b Age >65 G-TGTG/G-TGTG 86 (75%) 104 (90%) 1 A- ----/- 29 (25%) 12.92 (1.41 \u2013 6.07) 0.0031b Age >65 G-TGTG/G-TGTG 106 (65%) 116 (70%) 1 A- - male & age >65 G-TGTG 201 (82%) 203 (83%) 1 A- ---- 43 (18%) 43 (17%) 1.01 (0.63 \u2013 1.61) 0.9668 Female & age >65 G-TGTG 63 (77%) 76 (88%) 1 A- ---- 19 (23%) 10 (12%) 2.29 (0.99 \u20135.29) 0.0478b Comparison of genotype frequenciesc Stratification by sex and age Male & age 65 G-TG study was a population-based genetic association study in which both cases and controls were unrelated ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong. both cases and controls had the same mean age (65 years old) and the same proportion of both sexes (74% male) the difference in mean age between cases and controls could be as large as 19.8 years. both markers SLC1 and IL8rb did not show any statistically significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies between TBP and TBC in the Chinese population under study. negative finding with IL8rb is supported by a recent american study conducted for white Americans and African Americans. one study revealed that the investigators did not publish the negative result of association for SLC1 [50]. the reason for examining other SLC11A1 markers, but not SLC1 were not stated in the other three studies. there is only one report of positive association between SLC1 and TB susceptibility in Asian populations. the minor alleles of both SLC6a and SLC6b are much less common in Caucasians than in non-Caucasians. it is possible that this difference in allele frequency might partly explain the racial difference in TB susceptibility. tuberculosis tended to increase between 60 and 70 years of age for the patients. differences in allele and genotype frequencies were found significant only in the female group and the younger age group (age 65 years), but not in the male group or the older age group (age 65 years), but not in the male group or the older age group. only females showed the significant association between SLC6a/b and TB. this could lead to a limited supply of iron ions in phagosomes. the elderly are a highly susceptible group with a higher case rate of TB. authors' contributions KHL carried out nucleic acid extraction, genotyping and data analysis, and drafted the manuscript. authors read and approved the final manuscript."}
