{"summary": "nationwide cohort study aimed to assess the rate of developing active TB among patients receiving dialysis for ESRD during 2004\u20132013. the incidences of active TB in the ESRD and control cohorts were calculated for 2004\u20132013. the convergence of the TB and ESRD epidemics is generating a significant public health burden and making it difficult to control TB in Korea. chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with altered cellular immunity that is caused by various factors, including advanced age, uraemia, hypoalbuminemia, malnutrition, and medical immunosuppression. data regarding patients who received dialysis were obtained from the KNHIS database. the database contains reimbursement data from all medical facilities. the KNHIS database includes approximately 1,000,000 individuals (2.2% of the total Korean population) the diagnosis of active TB was then confirmed based on prescriptions for 2 anti-TB drugs. the drugs included isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, amikacin, kanamycin, streptomycin, quinolones, thioamide, cycloserine, and para-aminosalicylic acid. logistic regression was used to create propensity scores for each patient. individuals in both cohorts were randomly ordered and matched 1:1. if a match could not be found, the algorithm proceeded sequentially to an individual with the closest propensity score to make the next-best match. the follow-up period started on the first date of dialysis for the cases. the follow-up period ended at the first date of TB diagnosis or the last follow-up date. all patients' records were previously anonymised to ensure patient confidentiality. patients with a diagnosis of ESRD who had used medical services in 2003 were excluded based on the assumption that they had chronic ESRD. criteria for identifying dialysis were used to exclude patients in the KNHIS-NSC who had received dialysis. income level was scored on a scale of 0 to 10, and was categorised into three groups: low, middle, and high. we included patients who began dialysis before their diagnosis of active TB based on the visit date. data between 2014 and 2015 were excluded because the KNHIS-NSC database contained only data up to 2013. the incidence of active TB was expressed as the number of newly diagnosed active TB cases per 100,000 person-years. the incidence rate ratio (IRR) of ESRD, relative to the controls, was calculated with its 95% confidence interval (CI) the observation periods were 212,417 person-years in the dialysis cohort and 278,960 person-years in the control cohort. the mean durations of follow-up were 3.6 2.7 years in the dialysis cohort and 4.7 2.8 years in the control cohort. newly diagnosed active TB was detected for 457 patients in the dialysis cohort (0.8%) and 125 individuals in the control cohort (0.2%) the incidences were 215/100,000 person-years in the dialysis cohort and 45/100,000 person-years in the control cohort (0.2%) the patients with ESRD had a significantly elevated risk of active TB. 41,793 29 8.03 (4.41\u201316.04) 50\u201359 124 (0.2) 52,447 236 29 (0.0) 63,374 46 5.17 (3.43\u20138.03) 60\u201369 106 (0.2) 48,663 218 34 (0.1) 77,013 44 4.93 (3.32\u20137.49) 70\u201379 58 (0.1) 29,148 199 35 (0.1) 54,521 64 3.10 (2.00\u20134.86) 80 4 (0.0) the cumulative active TB incidence was significantly higher in the dialysis cohort than in the control cohort (P 0.001; log-rank test) however, there was no significant difference in the risk of active TB between the haemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis subgroups (P = 0.67; log-rank test) aAdjusted for gender, age, income level, DM, malignancy, COPD, HIV infection, and silicosis. TB = tuberculosis, HR = hazard ratio, CI = confidence interval, DM = diabetes mellitus, COPD = chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV = human immunodeficiency virus. nationwide cohort study revealed that dialysis was associated with a 4.39-fold higher risk of active TB than among the matched control group. the results are consistent with previous reports describing a high risk of active TB among patients with ESRD. ethambutol and pyrazinamide are both cleared through the kidney and require renal-adjusted dosing. anti-TB medication causes more severe and frequent toxicities among patients with ESRD. patients undergoing haemodialysis have markedly more frequent hospital visits than those undergoing peritoneal dialysis. the risk of nosocomial TB infection is not a great concern among patients undergoing dialysis. dialysis patients might have more frequent visits to clinics and a higher likelihood of receiving appropriate screening (e.g., chest radiography), and would be more likely to seek medical attention if TB symptoms arose. the diagnosis of active TB was based on the ICD-10 codes and drug prescription history, which may be associated with limited sensitivity. the prolonged follow-up was sufficient to examine the temporal relationship between the onset of ESRD and subsequent active TB. international societies have only recently recommended systematic TB testing for patients receiving dialysis."}
