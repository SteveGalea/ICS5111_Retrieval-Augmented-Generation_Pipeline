{"summary": "the world health organization alert for the H1N1 influenza pandemic led to the implementation of certain measures regarding admission of patients with flu-like symptoms. the aim of this study was to retrospectively examine the characteristics of all subjects admitted to the Unit of Infectious diseases with flu-like symptoms. the virus is a triple-reassortant influenza virus containing genes from human, swine, and avian influenza viruses. most patients with H1N1 infection present flu-like symptoms with a benign course. the main cause of death is acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ngeal or nasopharyngeal swabs tested with real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction. upper respiratory tract specimens are not as specific (80%) as lower respiratory tract specimens. all patients remained under quarantine and isolation in negative pressure chambers according to WHO guidelines. sputum stain was given in 12/33 patients in group A and 15/27 in group B. the rest of the patients did not produce enough sputum quantity for staining or did not cooperate in giving sputum. a p value of less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. sexually active (8/33 group A) had negative pregnancy tests. all patients were treated with oseltamivir regimen (mean time 5.8 days in group A vs. 1.93 days in group B) the second chest film was positive for pneumonia infiltrates. oseltamivir regimen Mean 5.8 5-18 (2.7) 1.93 1-5 (1.2) NS Table 2. Radiographic findings in the two groups according to H1N1 status. seven patients of group A and 6 patients of group B had severe hypoxemia upon admission. hypoxemia was defined as decreased partial pressure of oxygen in blood 60 mmHg [23] there was no difference between the two groups for smoking. a patient is considered obese when BMI is 30. none of the patients received medications that affected their white blood count WBC (e.g. corticosteroids) none of the patients had acute renal failure and none of the patients in the Unit of Infectious diseases had to be intubated and admitted. the one of these 2 patients was recently diagnosed with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. the other had no co-morbidities. no significant differences were observed for mean temperature, saturation and partial O2. the subgroup of patients with pneumonia in both groups is so small that any statistical analysis is impossible and the power of the sample is quite small. the lack of significant differences in the percentages of patients with local patchy shadowing observed in group B and group A. nausea 4.5% vs. 1.5%, diarrhea 4.5% vs. 1.5%, vomiting 1.4 vs. 0.5%). it was difficult to distinguish the pharmaceutical side effects of osetalmivir from influenza symptoms in patients receiving antiviral treatment for less than 5 days. oseltamivir should be given until proof of negative RT-PCR result."}
