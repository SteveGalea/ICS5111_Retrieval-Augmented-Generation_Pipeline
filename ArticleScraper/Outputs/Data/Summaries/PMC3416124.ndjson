{"summary": "a virulent field PEDV strain, GD-B, was isolated from suckling piglets with severe diarrhea in 2010 to 2012. the sequence of the complete genome of GD-B was determined. the genome was assembled using DNAStar (version 7.0) the complete genome sequence of GD-B shares 99%, 97.4%, 97.8%, and 96.8% nucleotide sequence identity with that of CH/FJND-3/2011, respectively (1\u20134) there are four remarkable insertion regions (nt 20,802 to 20,804, nt 20,815 to 20,823, nt 20,844, and nt 21,055 to 21,057) and two deletion regions (nt 20,856 and nt 21,114 to 21, complete genome sequence of PEDV strain GD-B has been deposited in GenBank under accession no. JX088695. nucleotide sequence accession number."}
