{"summary": "TEXT Traces of the origins of viruses and viral proteins are often masked or erased by the high mutation rates, long evolutionary history, and many genetic tricks of the viruses. evolutionary clues can be lost even in tertiary structures of viral proteins, presenting evolutionary conundrums. coronavirus S1 subunits recognize a variety of host receptors. the diversities in their S1 sequences and receptor usage present evolutionary puzzles surrounding coronavirus spike proteins. us severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (3, 4, 9). MHV NTD and human galectins share the same fold. NL63-CoV and NL63-CoV C-domains each represent a novel fold. the core structure of the NL63-CoV C-domain is a -sandwich consisting of two -sheet layers that stack against each other. the core structure of the NL63-CoV C-domain is a single-layer five-strand -sheet (5-7-8-6-3) with two -helices (4-1) stacked against it. NL63-CoV and NL63-CoV C-domains share related structural topologies. strands -4 and -1 in NL63-CoV become helices 4 and 1 in SARS-CoV. strands -6 and -3 are located at the center of the -sheet in NL63-CoV. the NL63-CoV and SARS-CoV C-domains both bind to the same virus-binding motifs (VBMs) on ACE2, ACE2 is bound in different orientations when the two C-domains are structurally aligned. ACE2 is bound in different orientations when the two C-domains are structurally aligned. alpha-CoV and gamma-CoV NTDs likely share similar structural topologies with beta-CoV MHV NTD. beta-CoV MHV NTD originated from galectin but later evolved a carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule (CEACAM1)-binding function. future structural determinations of coronavirus S1 domains will further clarify the curious evolutionary relationships among coronavirus spike proteins."}
