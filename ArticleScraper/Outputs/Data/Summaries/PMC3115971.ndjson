{"summary": "the torovirus genome consists of a single RNA molecule of about 25\u201330 kb. the last third contains four open reading frames, ORFs 2\u20135, that code for the replication machinery. the HE gene is partially deleted when compared with other torovirus strains. torovirus pathogenesis is important to understand the basis of torovirus-induced disease. there are a few studies about torovirus pathogenesis that were performed with BToV. infected animals were sacrificed sequentially during early stages of infection. the induction of apoptosis represents one of the major components of the host antiviral responses. many viruses have been reported to inhibit apoptosis early in infection to facilitate the viral replication. many viruses have been reported to inhibit apoptosis early in infection to facilitate the viral replication. adenylate synthetase degrades both viral and host single-stranded RNA. PKR and RNase L activation effectively inhibits viral and cellular gene expression. caspases are intracellular proteases that play an essential role during apoptosis. we report the first biochemical study of the effects caused by a torovirus in the infected cells. we found that typical morphological and biochemical features of apoptosis are induced in BEV infected cells. we found that both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are involved, being the second likely activated through caspase-8. the virus was grown in E. Derm cells and was partially purified by ultracentrifugation over 20% sucrose cushion. the virus was titrated by plaque assay as previously described. cell extracts were lysed in Laemmli buffer with 5% -mercaptoethanol. labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography of the dried gels. apoptosis quantitation by analysis of the nuclear DNA content. cells were washed three times with PBS, incubated 45 min at 37\u00b0C with RNase-A (0.1 mg/ml) and stained with PI (10 g/ml). rRNA analysis To analyze rRNA degradation, E. Derm and MRC-5 cells were seeded in 6-well plates. cells treated with staurosporine (500 nM) for 6 h were included in the assay as a control of cytocrome c redistribution in cells undergoing apoptosis induced through the mitochondrial pathway. pelleted cells were resuspended in 100 l of an isotonic sucrose buffer (250 mM sucrose, 10 mM Hepes, 10 mM KCl, 1.5 mM KCl proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Sigma) and an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot detection kit (ECL, GE Health Care) the virus was grown in E. Derm cells and was partially purified by ultracentrifugation over 20% sucrose cushion. the virus was titrated by plaque assay as previously described. images were acquired with a digital camera (CCD Hamamatsu Orca R2). monolayers of E. Derm cells were fixed in situ 24 hpi with a mixture of 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) and 2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 for 1 h. cells were seeded over coverslips, infected with BEV (5 pfu/cell) and fixed with 4% PFA at the indicated times. the percentage of cells with hypodiploid DNA content was determined by flow cytometry. rRNA analysis To analyze rRNA degradation, E. Derm and MRC-5 cells were seeded in 6-well plates, and infected with BEV (5 pfu/cell) at 8, 16, 24 and 48 hpi, medium was removed, cells were washed with PBS and lysed with 350 l of the RLT buffer from the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen), and RNA purified following the manufacturer's instructions. centrifugated at 14.000 rpm 5 min, and the soluble cytosolic fractions were transferred to new tubes containing 25 l of 5 Laemmli sample buffer. digitonin-insoluble fractions (membrane-bound organellar fractions) were washed once with isotonic buffer and directly disrupted in 125 l of 1 Laemmli sample buffer. protein lysates were fractionated by SDS-PAGE and mouse monoclonal anti-actin (Ab8226, Abcam), rabbit polyclonal against Bid (1500; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), two rabbit polyclonal sera against the BEV nucleocapsid protein (anti-BEV-N, 11000) and membrane protein (anti-BEV-M, 11000) proteins were detected using horseradish peroxidase-labeled secondary antibodies (Sigma) and an enhanced chemiluminescence Western blot Figure 2 shows the comparison of the appearance of an uninfected E. Derm cell (Panel A) with a BEV infected cell showing apoptosis. the number of cells showing this morphology readily increases with the time postinfection. these results suggest that BEV causes apoptosis at late times of the infection cycle. protein synthesis inhibition in E. Derm and MRC-5 cells infected with BEV. proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the gels were subjected to autoradiography. a significant general reduction in protein synthesis was observed at 24 and 32 hpi. a high molecular weight protein can be observed, which increased from 6 to 10 hpi and diminished from 16 hpi onwards. two additional faint bands in the range of 75- to 100-kDa could be observed at 16 hpi, that could correspond to the 200-kDa S protein precursor. Western blot analysis of MRC-5 cells infected with BEV (5 pfu/cell) reacted with specific antibodies against the BEV structural S, M and N proteins. the position of a protein recognized unespecifically by the anti-S monoclonal antibodies are indicated in the upper panels. eIF2 and PKR are phosphorylated in BEV infected cells. a common mechanism for down-regulating protein synthesis during apoptosis is through the phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF2. eIF2 and PKR are phosphorylated in BEV infected cells. a transient eIF2 phosphorylation was observed in both cell lines starting at 8 hpi and decreasing by 24 and 32 hpi. in both cell lines PKR phosphorylation was first observed at 6 hpi and increased at 8 hpi. in e. Derm cells similar phosphorylation dynamics were observed for both eIF2 and PKR. rRNA corresponding to 2105 cells was fractionated in each lane of a 1% agarose gels stained with EtBr. the positions of the 28S and 18S rRNA molecules are indicated at the left of the figure. this indicates that the protein synthesis blockade observed after BEV infection seems to be related to the phosphorylation of eIF2 which could be caused by PKR. eIF4GI is a 220-kDa protein that can be cleaved in two different places during apoptosis, giving rise to a 76-kDa central fragment and two other fragments of about 50-kDa. eIF4GI presented a similar pattern, with the appearance of the 50-kDa band and the concomitant decrease of the 220-kDa band. cells were harvested at 24 (E. Derm) and 38 (MRC5) hpi. from these results we concluded that BEV-induced apoptosis involves caspase activation. nuclei were stained with Hoechst and observed by fluorescence microscopy. at 30 hpi we found a small percentage of apoptotic nuclei (6%) at 38 hpi. the percentage of apoptotic nuclei recorded was 12%. the percentages of apoptotic cells were determined as the subG0-G1 fraction. data represent the media the standard deviation of three experiments. in order to quantify more efficiently the kinetics of appearance of apoptotic nuclei, we analyzed the nuclear DNA content by flow cytometry. 5.370.97% of apoptotic cells at 38 hpi increased to 9.60.46 at 48 hpi. both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways are involved in the apoptosis induced by BEV in the infected cells. the difference in the level of apoptosis between non-treated cells and cells treated with the caspase-9 inhibitor was not statistically significant. however, by Western blot analysis we observed a clear effect of this inhibitor on the cleavage of the caspase substrate eIF4GI. untreated and inhibitor-treated cells infected with BEV were collected at 24 and 38 hpi respectively. infected but untreated cells were used as a control (A, B and C) cells were collected at 48 hpi, and the cellular DNA content was analyzed by flow cytometry after PI staining. asterisks indicate statistically significant differences between the means relative to the corresponding control. cell death receptor and mitochondrial pathways are implicated in apoptosis. the mitochondrial pathway could be secondarily activated by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid. cytochrome c release from the mitochondria and cleavage of Bid could be secondarily activated by caspase-8-mediated cleavage. cells were mock-infected or infected with BEV (5 pfu/cell), harvested at 24 hpi. cells treated with staurosporine for 6 h, included as a positive control for mitochondrial pathway activation, were also fractionated. in cells treated with staurosporine (lanes 1) only the intact 22-kDa form of Bid was detected. these results confirm that the mitochondrial pathway is involved in BEV-induced apoptosis, and points to cleavage of Bid by caspase-8 as the triggering factor. the first signs of infection could be detected by about 24 hpi. however, extensive CPE was observed at 48 hpi. some cells showed characteristic signs of apoptosis. the number of cells showing this morphology readily increases with the time postinfection. ultrathin sections of 60\u201370 nm were stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate. characteristic signs of apoptosis, such as chromatin condensation, membrane blebbing and cell disassembly, were evident in some cells infected with BEV at 24 hpi. the identity of the 17- and 20-kDa proteins was confirmed by analysis of the same samples by Western blot with anti-BEV-N and anti-BEV-M antibodies. the patterns of appearance of both proteins were similar to those observed by metabolic labeling. sie blue (B and E), and labeled proteins were detected by autoradiography of the dried gel (A and D) the two major proteins that arise throughout the infection with BEV, identified as the structural M and N proteins, are indicated with arrows at the right side of each figure. synthesis reduction similar to that observed in MRC-5 cells at 24 and 32 hpi. also, the 17- and 20-kDa viral proteins were detected. their identity as BEV N and M proteins was also confirmed by Western blot. a transient eIF2 phosphorylation was observed in both cell lines starting at 8 hpi and decreasing by 24 and 32 hpi. in both cell lines PKR phosphorylation was first observed at 6 hpi and increased at 8 hpi. in e. Derm cells similar phosphorylation dynamics were observed for both eIF2 and PKR. the positions of molecular mass markers in kDa are indicated at the left of each panel. rRNA was analyzed in E. Derm and MRC-5 cells infected with BEV (5 pfu/cell) at the indicated times between 8 and 48 hpi. eIF4GI is a 220-kDa protein that can be cleaved in two different places during apoptosis. the eIF4GI is a 220-kDa protein that can be cleaved in two different places during apoptosis, giving rise to a central fragment and two other fragments of about 50-kDa. da fragment and a concomitant decrease of the 116-kDa band started between 8 and 16 hpi in E. Derm cells, and at 38 hpi in MRC-5 cells. from these results we concluded that BEV-induced apoptosis involves caspase activation. cells were inoculated with BEV (2.5 pfu/cell) or with an equivalent amount of UV-inactivated BEV. at 24 hpi cells were harvested and analyzed by Western blot. we did not observe any CPE on the cells treated with UV-inactivated virus. cells were infected with BEV (5 pfu/cell) and a nuclei staining kinetic study was performed. as a control, mock-infected cells were used (Mock) cells were fixed with PFA at the indicated hpi. the assay was performed three times, and the results of the three experiments are represented in Fig. 6C. 11.173.05% of cells infected with BEV appear in the subG0-G1 peak at 24 hpi. this percentage progressively increased at 38 and 48 hpi. general caspase inhibitor clearly protected cells against apoptosis. cleavage of PARP was not significantly prevented by any of the caspase inhibitors, and it was only slightly inhibited when used at. analysis of the effect of caspase inhibitors z-VAD-fmk, z-IETD-fmk and z-LEHD-fmk on BEV infected cells. infected but untreated cells were used as a control (A, B and C) infected but untreated cells were used as a control (A, B and C) cytochrome c released from the mitochondria and cleavage of Bid. the mitochondrial pathway could be secondarily activated by caspase-8-mediated cleavage of Bid. cytochrome c was exclusively found in the insoluble membranous fraction (lanes 2). cytochrome c was clearly present in the mitochondria containing fraction of the differently treated cells. but it could be only barely observed in the cytosolic fractions of cells infected for 24 hpi. this is in agreement with all the above results that indicate that in MRC-5 cells the apoptotic process occurs at a lower rate. cleavage of Bid into the 15-kDa pro-apoptotic active form (tBid) could be observed in both cell lines infected with BEV (lanes 3) in mock-infected cells (lanes 2) and in cells treated with staurosporine (lanes 1) only the intact 22-kDa form of Bid was detected. this results confirm the mitochondrial pathway is involved in BEV-induced apoptosis. the virus causes a CPE in the epithelial cells of the intestine. it causes severe vacuolar degeneration, necrosis and exfoliation of the enterocytes, inducing villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia and fused villi. cytopathological changes are apparent at about 21 hpi only in about 10% of the cells. dsRNA accumulation is common during apoptotic onset. dsRNA binds and activates two apoptosis triggers that lead to protein synthesis inhibition. dsRNA activates 2\u2032-5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase, leading to activation of latent RNase L. rRNA cleavage observed in BEV infected cells is mediated by RNase L and/or other ribonuclease. dsRNA also activates endogenous PKR, which leads to eIF2 phosphorylation. however, we cannot discard the possibility that any of the two other virus-activated cellular kinases known to phosphorylate eIF2, the PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kina cleavage of PARP and eIF4GI substrates readily occur in BEV-infected cells, both E. Derm and MRC-5, in a time-dependent manner. these results also suggest that eIF4GI degradation could be another factor contributing to the observed protein synthesis inhibition. similar results have been described with SARS-CoV [68]. in MHV it has been reported that viral replication was not required. it was suggested that virus fusion triggered after virus binding to the cell receptor was sufficient to initiate the apoptosis signal through Fas activation. PKR is involved in activating Fas-dependent apoptosis independent of FasL in response to various stress-inducing stimuli. early activation of PKR seems to be important for upregulating Fas gene expression and induction of apoptosis [86], [87] in influenza virus infections, an early induction of Fas gene expression at the level of transcription upon BEV infection. specific experiments would be required to ascertain which caspase is cleaving PARP in cells infected with BEV in the presence of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk. apoptosis does not affect virus replication and/or release in vitro. coronaviruses hypothesize that apoptosis could be the pathological basis for the lesions of the diseased tissue alteration. further work will be required to delineate the pathway(s) involved in cell death and to identify the viral and cellular factors involved in modulating torovirus-induced apoptosis."}
