{"summary": "18-month-old lioness was weaned from her mother at the age of 5 mo. her diet had been based on chicken, rabbit, and beef supplemented with taurine 5 mg twice a week. serological tests for feline leukemia virus, feline immune deficiency virus and feline coronavirus were negative. no signs of uveitis were present in the right eye. intraocular pressure readings were 0.4%. the IOP in both eyes was within normal limits. the preoperative anterior chamber depth (ACD) was 5.76 mm (+/ 1.89 mm) OD and 7.36 mm (+/ 1.41 mm) OS. the postoperative ACD (PACD) was calculated as the distance between the corneal epithelium and the center of the lens. both eyes received 4 cycles of topical dexamethasone 0.2% (Luxazone; Allergan S.p.A. RM, Italy), ofloxacin 0.3% (Exocin; Allergan) and tropicamide 0.5% with phenylephrine 20 min apart. electroretinography (ERG) was performed in both dim light and dark adaptation. a 2-step corneal incision using a microsurgical blade n.64 (Swann-Morton, Sheffield, UK) and a keratome with a blade width of 2.8 mm (Surgical Specialties Corporation, Tijuana, Mexico) was made 1 mm from the limbal margin at the 1 o\u2019clock position. a 9-mm anterior capsulotomy was made with a 25-gauge 1-inch needle and Vannas scissors. the left eye was treated with topical antibiotic ofloxacin 0.3% (Exocin; Allergan RM, Italy) 4 times daily for 15 d. the lioness was sedated and anesthetized following the same protocol. a conventional one-handed phacoemulsification was performed on the right eye. time for the phacoemulsification was 2 min and 52 s. the postoperative treatment was the same as for the right eye. the lioness was sedated with medetomidine (Domitor; Elanco), 30 g/kg BW, ketamine (Ketavet 100; Intervet), 2 mg/kg BW, and butorphanol (Dolorex; MSD-Animal Health), 0.1 mg/kg BW. anesthesia was induced with propofol (Vetofol; Esteve, MI, Italy), 1 mg/kg BW the lioness was positioned in dorsal recumbency. the ocular surface was prepared with povidone iodine solution. the eyelids were prepared with a dilution of 1:10 of the same povidine iodine (18). vilinear capsulorrhexis (CCC) was carried out using a 30\u00b0 phacoemulsification needle. total phacoemulsification time was 4 min and 42 s. the ultrasonic power used was 80%. one week after surgery, the lioness was sedated and anesthetized following the same protocol as previously described for performing the surgery on the right eye. the left eye showed an extrusion of one of the haptics. a conventional one-handed phacoemulsification was performed on the right eye. retinoscopy performed at this time revealed both eyes to be within 1.5 D of emmetropia. left and right eyes showed a well-centered intraocular lens with no signs of anterior uveitis. last complete ophthalmological evaluation was done 7 y after surgery. lioness had exhibited aggressive behavior since birth, a congenital etiology would be most likely. post-operative medical therapy is the gold standard treatment of cataracts. if surgery is not performed, the patient must be monitored and treated medically for complications such as lens-induced uveitis (LIU), secondary glaucoma, retinal detachment, and lens luxation (3). small animal patients that undergo phacoemulsification receive intensive post-operative treatment with topical and systemic antibiotic and anti-inflammatory drugs, Elizabethan collar, and IOP measurements every 2 h for the first 12 h. the treatment was reduced to topical application of ofloxacin 0.3% 4 times a day for 14 d. retinoscopy revealed both eyes being within 1.5 D of emmetropia. haptics of the lens needed to be shortened, as the IOL was too long for this patient."}
