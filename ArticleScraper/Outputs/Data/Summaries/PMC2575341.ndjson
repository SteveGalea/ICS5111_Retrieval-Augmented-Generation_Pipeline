{"summary": "the north-south downhill cline frequency of the chemokine receptor CCR5 allele with a 32-bp deletion (CCR5-32) raises interesting questions for evolutionary biologists. we had suggested that in the past, the European colonizers, principally Romans, might have been instrumental of a progressively decrease of the frequencies southwards. the strongest evidence for adaptive selection in the human genome has been obtained for genes involved in immune defense. the 32-bp coding sequence deletion, CCR5-32, of the chemokine receptor CCR5 is probably the more recent and complete example of a gene studied from clinical, epidemiological and evolutionary genetics. geographic distribution of the CCR5-32 allele (A) compared with historical range of felids carrying species-specific FIVs (B) only the frequencies of Native populations have been evidenced in America, Asia, Africa and Oceania. we have proposed an alternative hypothesis in which the actual allele frequency distribution might not be due to the genes spreading, but to a negative selection resulting in the spread of pathogens principally during principally Roman expansion. the idea that bottlenecks and founder effects could lead to an increase in damaging alleles in human populations was reserved for isolated populations that experienced severe founder effects. the cause of the decrease of the ancestral CCR5-32 allele frequency in southern european populations is probably due to infectious agent(s) it has been suggested that the most important infectious diseases of modern food-producing human populations also include diseases that could have emerged only within the past 11,000 years, following the rise of agriculture. the concept of pathocenosis attempts to offer a synthetic view of disease ecology. it is defined as all interdependences within pathogens, their hosts and their environment. the aim of this article is to critically discuss the possible nature of this parasite(s) responsible for the decrease of the null allele frequency in the Southern European populations. many of the major human infectious diseases have arisen only after the origins of agriculture (11,000 years BP) the five animal species (cow, sheep, goat, pig and dog) which have had probably the most epidemic impact on the human populations are explicitly named the Pandora's pentad. earliest evidence of cat-human association involves co-occurrence in Cyprus deposits aged 9,500 years ago. felids originated from African or Middle East wildcats which were introduced by Neolithic navigators about 6,000\u20138,000 years ago. earliest records of probably tamed or domestic cats in continental Europe would be in Greece by 1000 BC. all the cat zoonoses, according to us, only one parasite distribution could be correlated to those of the CCR5-32 allele frequency. historical regions with null or low frequency of CCR5-32 allele coincide with historical range of the wild felid species. the 37 felid species form eight distinct evolutionary lineages. at least 11 free ranging Felidae species harbor FIV antibodies and viral genomes. lion, leopard, pallas cat, jaguarundi, ocelot, domestic cat, puma and bobcat have been shown to harbor species-specific FIVs. domestic cat, cheetah, and south american free-ranging felid populations tend to show seroprevalence rates of 10% or less. a species-specific virus has also been found in Hyaenidae, which belong to the Feloidea superfamily. black-footed cat Africa +/- cb - N.D.

Pallas Cats (F. manul) have been reports of this cat being kept in a semi-domestic state in central Asia [52,110] there is evidence from paintings and bas-reliefs in tombs that in ancient Egypt striped hyenas were tamed and kept as pets. in pre-Columbian times, relatively few animals were domesticated, and almost none of them extended beyond the geographic limits of their wild ancestors. at least four empires (egyptian, Hyksosian, Achaemenian and Greek) have been on two continents. the romans displayed lions, tigers, leopards, cheetahs and other felids in menageries, pageants and arena combats. in the second century AD there were more than a hundred amphitheatres in Italy and a similar number in Europe. nine felid species have the largest distribution of any felid. leopards have the largest distribution of any felid. lion populations have been distributed in Middle East to India and in Africa. only two species (Eurasian and Iberian lynx) and one subspecies (Eurasian wildcat) of wild felids live since historical times. their seropositive level is null or very low and probably due to recent contamination by domestic cat. previous analyses suggested that in Europe the CCR5-32 allele frequency is negatively correlated with colonization by ancient Mediterranean civilizations principally Romans. the family of SIV is 1 out of 5 primate borne retroviruses known to infect humans. in cameroon, more than 60% of the population is directly exposed to fresh nonhuman primate blood and bodily fluids from hunting, butchering or petting. there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission of SFV. only a few cases (n = 6) have had a short clinical follow-up. there is no evidence of human-to-human transmission of SFV. the ability of FIV to express its LTR in primate cells seems to vary depending on the viral strain, the experimental protocol, and the cell line used. a puma FIV isolate targeted gastrointestinal peripheral lymphoid tissues or other sites in a domestic cat infection model [171] there are no firm data to support a role for CCR5 in infections of feline cells. but a FIV strain could use human CCR5 to infect some human cells. this could be the result of a recent shift in coreceptor usage. recombination plays a significant role in evolution of FIV. cross-species transmissions likely did occur in the past to produce a pattern of viral evolution in felids that does not completely match the evolution of the Felidae. several prolonged or not fevers occurred relatively frequently during Antiquity [179] and still today, several of them are probably zoonoses. infections usually benign alone could have more severe effects on people co-infected by several epidemic or endemic pathogenous agents. implication of a feline retrovirus could be plausible. this could explain why the CCR5-32 allele frequency is relatively weak in these areas, even if this mutation has arisen, they could be rapidly under selected. this could explain the quasi-null allele frequency in Australia, in spite that the Aborigines have not been in. the presence and frequencies of the CCR5-32 variant in past human populations has been studied by several authors. the results of these studies have argue against the possibility that plague was a major selective force that caused a rapid increase in CCR5-32 gene frequencies within European populations [22,214]. the continuation of the Neanderthal genome project provides a unique opportunity to identify genetic changes that are specific to modern humans. dating such genetic events would help to interpret these changes mechanistically, he says. he adds that dating such genomic events would help to date such changes. ancient DNAs from felids are useful not only to phylogenetic analysis, but also to population genetic approaches that may increase our understanding of the incipient extinction of modern species. more than half of the 1407 human pathogens are zoonotic [131] and recent epidemics have changed the view we had about emerging infectious diseases. the family of SIV is 1 out of 5 primate borne retroviruses known to infect humans. the family of SIV is 1 out of 5 primate borne retroviruses known to infect humans. it is not known exactly how HIV first entered the human population. there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission of SFV. there is currently no evidence of human-to-human transmission of SFV. only a few cases (n = 6) have had a short clinical follow-up. the lack of serum detection suggests that seroconversion is not indicative of prior exposure to the virus. the ability of FIV to express its LTR in primate cells seems to vary depending on the viral strain, the experimental protocol, and the cell line used. a lentivirus strain could use human CCR5 to infect human cells. this could be the result of a recent shift in coreceptor usage. this could be the result of a recent shift in coreceptor usage. a lentivirus strain could use human CCR5 to infect some human cells. recombination plays a significant role in the evolution of FIV. cross-species transmissions likely did occur in the past to produce a pattern of viral evolution in felids that does not completely match the evolution of the Felidae. infections could induce fever, this might pass unnoticed and moreover, several prolonged or not fevers occurred relatively frequently during Antiquity. the in vitro lytic properties of this virus in monkey and human cells suggest possible biological abnormalities associated with human FIV infection. the hypothesis of the role of a feline retrovirus remains putative. despite the redundancy of the chemokine system, blocking CCR5 was predicted to be safe because individuals lacking CCR5 develop normally and seem healthy. however, over the years, the CCR5-32 allele has been linked with several non infectious human diseases, including multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia. in humans, similarly to HIV-1, CCR5-32 carriers also have a decreased likelihood of contracting hepatitis B virus [206]. if our hypothesis is correct, this could explain the quasi-null allele frequency in Australia [211], in spite that the Aborigines have not been in contact with felids during approximately 50,000 years. future studies on ancient DNA will confirm or reject our hypothesis which include a great CCR5-32 allele frequency in the ancient European population. the continuation of the Neanderthal genome project provides a unique opportunity to identify genetic changes that are specific to modern humans [215]. dating such genomic events would help to interpret these changes mechanistically. a recent review has concluded that it seems unlikely that Neanderthals contributed any substantial fraction of modern variation. the molecular resolution of extinct species' genomes raises the hope of discovering infectious agents and pathogens that might have played a regulatory role in historic ecosystems. ancient DNAs from felids are useful not only to phylogenetic analysis but also to population genetic approaches that may increase our understanding of the incipient extinction of modern species. bibliographical analysis shows that species-specificity of FIV might be less stringent than previously considered. the abundance of studies demonstrating the capacity of viruses, including retrovirus, to cross species raises questions about ongoing transmissions and renders the study of the adaptation required for viruses to be transmitted from one host species to another increasingly relevant. phylogenetic analyses were performed using the Neighbor-Joining (NJ) method [226] in PHYLIP version 3.6 alpha 3 [227] accessed at http://bioinfo.hku.hk/services/menuserv.html. Robustness of nodes was estimated by running a bootstrap test with 100 replicates."}
