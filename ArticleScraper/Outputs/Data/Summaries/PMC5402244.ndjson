{"summary": "MERS is a deadly and contagious disease caused by a novel coronavirus. it can be transmitted in different ways, including direct contact with dromedaries, living with an infected person, or contact with infected persons inside healthcare facilities. the disease has a high mortality rate of up to 36%. a cross-sectional study was conducted using a self-administered questionnaire. the study was conducted in four tertiary care hospitals in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. participants were informed about the purpose of the study and their verbal consent was given. the ERRPs had a mean age of 27 years, 65% were male, and 37% were married. 63% had direct contact with at least one patient infected with MERS-CoV. 54% of ERRPs were afraid of contracting infection from infected patients. 48% of ERRPs would be afraid of telling their families about the risk. 42% agreed there would be inadequate staff in the workplace to handle the increased demand. 57% of ERRPs had received infection control training and 55% reported their hospitals have enough infection control staff to deal with such an outbreak. the majority of ERRPs believed that their work put them at risk of infection and they were afraid of contracting MERS. the majority of the ERRPs felt their job would expose their families, parents, and close friends to risk of infection. the most important emotion that drove healthcare workers to continue working was their ethical and professional obligation toward their profession [8] the findings are similar to those of other non-MERS viral outbreaks reported from different parts of the world. a study of the psychological impact of the 2003 outbreak of SARS on hospital employees in Beijing, China, found that about 10% of the respondents had experienced high levels of posttraumatic stress symptoms. study was conducted in four major hospitals in a single city in Saudi Arabia. the sample size was representative and reflects the real number of ERRPs working in these hospitals during the outbreak. ERRPs' concerns and the psychological impact of MERS outbreaks should be considered in greater detail by hospital policymakers."}
