{"summary": "the study was to assess the changes in lung function and lung thin-section computed tomography (CT) features in patients recovering from severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), especially the dynamic changes in ground-glass opacity (GGO) the serial follow-up thin-section CTs were evaluated at 3, 6, and 84 months after SARS presentation. thin-section computed tomography (CT) can show pulmonary abnormalities in patients with normal findings on plain X-ray. more distinctive radiographic features include the predominant involvement of lung periphery and lower zone, and the absence of cavitation, hilar lymphadenopathy, and pleural effusion. the diagnosis of SARS was based on the world health organization criteria [15]. the committees waived the need for individual consent because of the retrospective nature of the study. CT scans were performed with an 8-row multidetector CT scanner. the evaluation of the extent of lung involvement was based on the segments of the lung anatomy. 10 segments in the right lung and 10 segments in the left lung (2 segments were considered in the apicoposterius segment left upper lobe and 2 segments were considered in the inferior front segment of the left lower lobe) each CT was classified into 3 categories: 1) subpleural and/or peribronchovascular, 2) diffuse, or 3) irregular. patients Eleven patients discharged after treatment for SARS as inpatients between February and June 2003 at Beijing Friendship Hospital were followed up at 3, 6, and 84 months using thin-section CT. the diagnosis of SARS was based on the world health organization criteria [15] radiologists were blinded to the names of the patients and the length of time since onset. but they were aware of which images belonged to the same patient. a consensus had to be reached between the 2 radiologists about the abnormalities. the DLCO was determined using a single-breath carbon monoxide technique and an infrared analyzer. the DLCO was determined using the single-breath carbon monoxide technique and an infrared analyzer. ments involved Predominant HRCT findings Segments involved PFT 1 F 30 GGO 15 Reticulation and interlobular thickening 15 Mild 2 M 35 GGO 3 GGO 2 GGO 1 Mild 3 M 54 Consolidation and GGO 8 GGO 6 Reticulation and interlobular thickening 4 N 4 F 38 Diffuse GGO 9 GGO 3 Reticulation and interlobular thickening 3 Mild 5 F 42 Consolidation and GGO 13 Reticulation and inter at 84 months, as the predominant thin-section CT feature, 1 patient (9.1%) had no lung abnormality. 8 patients (72.7%) showed reticulation and interlobular thickening. 2 (18.2%) showed GGO. at 84 months, GGO was greatly reduced and interlobular thickening predominated. patchy decreased attenuation was seen at 3-, 6-, and 84-month CT. X-ray radiography showed consolidation in lower lobes of both lungs in acute phase.

X-ray revealed GGO, septal thickening, and fine-mesh shadows. at 84 months, GGO was reduced and interlobular thickening predominated. intralobular and interlobular septal thickening, subpleural lines, and traction bronchiectasis were observed as late as 84 months after SARS infection. all these thin-section CT manifestations were also found at 3 and 6 months during the recovery phase of SARS. the characteristic thin-section CT finding in SARS survivors changed from GGO predominance at 3\u20136 months to fine reticulation (intralobular and interlobular septal thickening) the present study suggests that either the lung fibrosis is very slow to disappear after infection or that the CT abnormality is different from lung fibrosis induced by other pneumonia viruses. the results of the present study do not resolve this issue. traction bronchiectasis was found in 3 patients, while patchy decreased attenuation was found in 1 patient. airway disease was more common in ARDS survivors, again suggesting the presence of underlying lung fibrosis."}
