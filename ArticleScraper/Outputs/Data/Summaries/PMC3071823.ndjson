{"summary": "Nipah virus (NiV) has caused several outbreaks in humans of encephalitic disease associated with high lethality. in the first outbreak, which was in Malaysia and Singapore, 265 humans became sick and some 40% of them died. the virus has re-emerged in Bangladesh and neighboring India, starting in 2001. two vaccination strategies for NiV disease prevention have already been explored. a canarypox virus-based vaccine vector approach was effective as veterinary vaccine. soluble NiV G protein approach has also shown promise [28], [29] two vaccines for human papillomavirus (HPV) and Sci-B-Vac (SciGen) and Bio-HepB (GlaxoSimthKline) for Hepatitis B virus (HBV) have already been approved for human use. many for non-enveloped and enveloped viruses are at various stages of development, attest to the desirability of this approach for vaccine development. these particles, composed of HN, F, M and NP proteins, had several virus-like properties. however, since the F protein in this formulation was modified by design to ablate the cleavage site, it remained in its precursor form. we describe NiV VLPs composed of the two surface glycoproteins G, and F, and the matrix protein M. we have provided the first CryoEM study of NiV VLPs. we further demonstrate that NiV VLPs activate innate immune signaling in \u201cinfected\u201d cells. we have shown that NiV VLPs activate innate immune signaling in \u201cinfected\u201d cells. lipid reagent Lipofectamine 2000 was harvested at 48 hrs post-transfection. the transfected-cell SUPs were clarified by centrifugation at 3,500 rpm for 30 minutes at 4\u00b0C. the clarified SUPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose cushion. a minigenome-based assay was used to determine the relative concentrations of the constituent plasmids. this assay provides only a comparative assessment of VLP formation. the method provides an indirect means to determine the optimal set of conditions for VLP production as determined by CAT enzyme activity. VLPs were imaged at 40,000x indicated magnification using a 4k4k slow-scan CCD camera. immunogold labeling Unfixed VLPs were used for immunogold labeling to limit antibody reactivity to the cell surface proteins. blot was incubated with HMAF primary antibody at a dilution of 11000 dilution, overnight at 4\u00b0C, and HRP-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibody. proteins were revealed using western blot detection reagents according to instructions provided by the manufacturer. each diluted sera was mixed with 50 l of NiV diluted to generate 30 plaque forming units. the pre-incubated virus-antibody mix was added to vero cell monolayers grown in 96 well plates and incubated for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. the cells were stained with goat anti-rabbit Alexa fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen) diluted 11000 in blocking buffer. anti-mouse antibody tested for eighty four genes involved in toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated signal transduction using RT2 Profiler PCR array. 293 cells grown overnight in 60 mm dishes were exposed to 10 g of purified VLPs suspended in 1 ml of OPTI-MEM. ds pCAGGS- G, F, and M are all under the control of chicken beta actin promoter [56]. human embryonic kidney 293 cells (ATCC, CRL-1573) and 293T cells (ATCC, CRL-11268) were grown in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium. all the initial minigenome-based optimization steps were done in BHK-T7 cells. the clarified SUPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose cushion in TN buffer (0.1 M NaCl; 0.05 M Tris-HCL, pH 7.4) the resulting pellet in 0.5 ml volume was purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient formed by layering 80%, 65%, 50% and 10% sucrose in TN buffer. after centrifugation at 186,000 g for 8 hours, the top 1.5 ml of the gradient was resus the steps involved in the VLP infectivity assay were transfection of NiV minigenome construct and co-transfection with full complement of the NiV protein expression plasmids, N, P, L, M, F and G. CAT assays FAST CAT Assay kit (Molecular Probes) was used according the manufacturer's instructions. on formvar coated nickel grids, stained with NiV specific primary antibody (hyper immune mouse ascites fluid, HMAF) diluted in buffer (1% BSA in 0.05 M tris buffer) rinsed in wash buffer (1% BSA in 0.05 M tris buffer) stained with colloidal gold labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) stained negatively with 2% uranyl acetate for viewing by EM. five to six week old female Balb/c mice were housed in microisolater cage for 4 days. they were immunized by subcutaneous inoculation of four different concentrations of VLPs. no adjuvant was used. va raised against the G protein of HeV and goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate diluted 11000 in blocking buffer. antibody levels measured by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) for IFA, NiV-specific total antibody levels were measured by using 293T cells as target antigen. the wells in the plate were blocked with BSA/PBS and stained with rabbit sera raised against the G protein of HeV. goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 conjugate (Invitrogen) diluted 11000 in blocking buffer. antibody levels measured by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) were measured by using NiV-specific total antibody levels. 293 cells grown overnight in 60 mm dishes were exposed to 10 g of purified VLPs suspended in 1 ml of OPTI-MEM. the inoculums were adsorbed on the cell monolayers for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C when additional 1.5 ml of OPTI-MEM was added. the integrity of the RNA was verified by agarose gel electrophoresis. paramyxoviruses form a transcription gradient where the 3\u2032 proximal genes are transcribed more abundantly than the successive downstream genes. the importance of protein ratios for VLP formation was alluded to in a previous NDV study where expression plasmids were co-transfected at \u201cpre-determined concentrations\u201d to produce VLP-incorporated protein ratios analogous to those in virus infected cells. the cells were harvested 48 hours later and tested for optimal particle production based on incoming minigenome-encoded CAT activity. this time point was chosen because maximum VLP formation was also found to be time dependent and optimal at 48 hours post-passage. the reproducibility of the results was verified in an independent repeat experiment. volume of SUP from each sample was used to infect new cell monolayers (VLP infected) which were transfected 24 hours earlier with the core plasmids N, P and L to support replication of the VLP-incorporated minigenome RNA. the VLP-infected cells were harvested 48 hours later for reporter gene analysis. negative staining shows a VLP-containing band in the sucrose gradient. the size variation of these VLPs was consistent with the parental virus: NiV is a pleomorphic virus ranging in size from 40\u20131900 nm [63], [64] the sizes of the VLPs ranged from 40\u2013500 nm. arrow shows functional assembly and immunoreactivity of NiV glycoproteins. unfixed particles were stained by immunogold labeling technique. unfixed particles were used so that only the surface proteins would be available. the NiV-specific bands in two different 293T cell lysate preparations were processed similarly (and shown in the left hand panel in Figure 3) confirms specificity of the VLP-incorporated proteins. the VLPs were processed and analyzed as described using manufacturer's instructions. incubation for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C, replaced with OPTI-MEM I. monolayers were then viewed for formation of syncytia after staining with crystal violet. results show that 293 cells exposed to NiV VLPs induced syncytium formation. titers increased with time post primary inoculation, i.e., the highest titers (12560) were seen on day 35. titers also increased with VLP dosage although by day 35, the three higher treatment groups seemed to produce similar titers. mice inoculated with the two highest VLP doses were able to induce neutralizing antibodies by day 35. titers ranged from 15 to >180. the control mice did not induce neutralizing response. IL-8 and MAPK8 genes are target genes in the downstream NFKB pathway. TBK1 and NFKB2 are target genes in the downstream NFKB pathway respectively. 293 cells were infected with 10 g of purified VLPs suspended in OPTI-MEM. to improve the efficiency of VLP formation we proceeded to optimize the ratio of the three expression plasmids used at transfection. we speculated that this would be important based on the fact that during replication, paramyxoviruses form a transcription gradient where the 3\u2032 proximal genes are transcribed more abundantly than the successive downstream genes. the minigenome and N, P and L plasmids were transfected using a predetermined ratio [57]. the cell SUP was harvested 48 hours post-transfection, clarified by centrifugation. equal volume from each was passaged onto fresh cell monolayers previously transfected with the core proteins required to support the incoming packaged minigenomes. this time point was chosen because maximum VLP formation was also found to be time dependent and optimal at 48 hours post-passage. cell SUPs were co-transfected with the previously optimized minigenome and N, P and L constructs. same volume of SUP from each sample was used to infect new cell monolayers (VLP infected) the cells were harvested 48 hours later for reporter gene analysis. Lane 1 is a negative control. the clarified SUPs were concentrated by ultracentrifugation through 20% sucrose cushion, then purified on a discontinuous sucrose gradient. the result presented in Figure 2A shows a VLP-containing band in the sucrose gradient. the particles were resuspended in TN buffer and viewed by cryoEM. stained sample shows several well preserved VLPs. a single particle had what appeared to be a double fringe, a feature normally thought to be associated with Hendra virus particles [9]. intracellular cleavage of the precursor NiV fusion protein by cathepsin L results in near equal mix of mature fusogenic, and the precursor forms [65]. absence of the NiV-specific bands in two different 293T cell lysate preparations processed similarly confirms specificity of the VLP-incorporated proteins. the inoculum was removed after incubation for 3 hours at 37\u00b0C, replaced with OPTI-MEM I, and the plates were further incubated overnight at 37\u00b0C overnight. the monolayers were then viewed for the formation of syncytium after staining with crystal violet. previous incubation with the unrelated JV antibodies failed to block this process. negative control group of five mice inoculated with sterile endotoxin free PBS. mice were bled from the submandibular vein on the day before primary inoculation. titers increased with time post primary inoculation, i.e., the highest titers were seen on day 35. all sera were tested individually by plaque reduction neutralization method. the results showed distinct association between VLP dosage and the ability to mount a neutralizing antibody response. mice inoculated with the two highest VLP doses were each able to induce neutralizing antibodies by day 35. a 4-fold cutoff threshold was used to determine modulation in gene expression. we noted significant VLP-stimulated up-regulation in the expression of NFKB2 and TBK1 genes respectively. close to four fold (3.9 fold) up-regulation was noted also in IL-8 and MAPK8 genes. a minigenome-based functional assay has allowed us to produce substantial quantities of NiV VLPs to undertake the studies described in this manuscript. we have shown that these particles are functionally assembled, biologically active and are able to induce innate immune responses and a neutralizing antibody response. no vaccine for NiV disease has been developed so far that would be both safe and protective for humans. potential pathogenicity of VSV-based vaccine vectors remains a concern. native VLPs allow the viral proteins to be presented to the immune system in the same conformation as in the virion for effective B and T cell response. incorporated NiV F protein was predominantly in the uncleaved precursor form. this finding is clearly distinct from ours since our VLPs contained substantial amounts of cleaved F protein. this may have been related to ratios of the interacting proteins expressed in 293T transfected cells. this is the first study describing fusion from without induced by VLPs of any paramyxovirus, or any other enveloped viruses. fusion from without induced syncytia formation in 293 cells that could be neutralized with NiV-specific antibodies. a first dose of only 3.5 or 1.75 ug/mouse (treatment group B and A respectively), 3 of 5 and 1 of 5 produced neutralizing antibodies. we believe that this response compares favorably with the levels of such response induced at an equivalent time point by some replication competent pseudotype viruses. a growing number of reports point to viral surface glycolproteins as relevant in host cell signaling and triggering of innate immune response. we believe that particles like NiV VLPs would induce an effective innate immune response for the promotion of the desired adaptive immunity [67], [76]."}
