{"summary": "direct mechanism involves expression of anti-viral genes that have evolved to recognize, react, and thereby rid the infected host of the viral nucleic acid. a major difference between these two mechanisms is that the latter is observed mostly in cis. successful viral pathogens have evolved to replicate and simultaneously evade or block either of these host responses. this is followed by IFN signaling and expression or activation of factors that target the inducer for degradation or modification. in this review we focus on two proteins containing homologous RNase domains, RNaseL with a known direct antiviral function. pathway or all RNaseL substrates are shown to undergo degradative cleavage. the cleavage products generated through degradation of the substrate are shown to potentially interact with RIG-I thereby leading to Interferon secretion and trans-activation of Oas genes through interferon signaling. dsRNA is present in a host cell infected by an RNA virus. such dsRNA is present in the form of replication-intermediates (RI) dsRNA is synthesized by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp) and subsequently synthesized by the same enzyme. these small ligands bear phosphate groups (1\u20133) at the 5\u2032 end and hydroxyl groups at the 2\u2032 and 3\u2032 positions. as part of a physiological control system these 2\u20135A oligomers are quite unstable in that they are highly susceptible to degradation by cellular 5\u2032-phosphatases and PDE12 (2\u2032-phosphodiesterase) the activity of the RNase domain is negatively regulated by the ARD. the activity of the RNase domain is relieved upon binding of 2\u20135A molecules to ankyrin repeats 2 and 4 followed by a conformational alteration. in vivo the RNaseL nuclease activity still seems to be under the sole regulation of 2\u20135A. mammalian genomes encode post-transcriptional and post-translation inhibitors of RNaseL activity in the form of microRNA-29. direct inhibition of RNaseL function is also observed upon infection by Picornaviruses through, either inducing the expression of ABCE1 or exercising a unique inhibitory property of a segment of the viral RNA. RNA sequences that are predominantly cleaved by RNaseL are U-rich. the cleavage points are typically at the 3\u2032 end of UA or UG or UU di-nucleotides, leaving a 5\u2032-OH and a 3\u2032-monophosphate in the cleavage product. cellular targets of RNaseL include both ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and mRNAs. a global effect of RNaseL is observed in the form of autophagy induced through c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling and apoptosis. the ER serves as a conduit for maturation of cellular proteins which are either secreted or destined to be associated with a membrane. a perturbation of the folding capacity can lead to an accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER lumen, which signals an unfolded protein response. IRE1 is a type I single-pass trans-membrane protein in which, similar to what is observed with RNaseL, the N-terminal resident in the ER lumen serves as sensor and the cytosolic C-terminal as the effector. the cytosolic C-terminal segments have a serine/threonine kinase domain and a RNase domain homologous to that of RNaseL. a trans-autophosphorylation by the kinase domain allosterically activates the RNase domain. IRE1 performs cleavage of a variety of RNA substrates mediated by its RNase domain. the IRE1 RNase domain cleaves the Xbp1u (u for unspliced) mRNA transcript at two precise internal positions within the open reading frame (ORF) the Xbp1u (u for unspliced) mRNA transcript at two precise internal positions is followed by splicing of the internal segment through ligation of the terminal cleavage products. the latter mode of negative regulation of gene expression is termed as the regulated IRE1-dependent a similar dual endonucleolytic cleavage is observed to initiate degradation of transcripts in the RIDD degradation pathway. the cleavage of Xbp1 and the RIDD-target transcripts constitute homeostatic or pro-survival response by IRE1 since XBP1S trans-activates genes encoding multiple chaperones (to fold unfolded proteins) HCMV (a DNA virus) and hepatitis C virus (a hepacivirus) interfere with IRE1 signaling by different mechanism. an observed inhibition of any cellular function by a virus infection could suggest a potential anti-virus function for it. single-stranded plus-sense RNA viruses encode a polyprotein, which produces replication complexes in cis, promoting formation of such subdomains. the fact that IRE1 forms bulky oligomers of higher order probably aggravates the fact that IRE1 forms bulky oligomers of higher order. RIDD target mRNAs encode ER-transitory but are not ER-essential proteins. most of the RIDD target mRNA are observed to be ER-membrane associated, the proximity to IRE1 facilitating association and cleavage. a continued translation of viral RNA can confer protection from the pattern of RNA. IRE1 and RNaseL share the functional consequences of their activation in initiating cellular apoptosis through JNK signaling. similarities in protein kinase domain and structural similarities in their RNase domain are narrowed by advances in research. IRE1 cleaves 28S rRNA and mRNA while IRE1 substrates include only mRNAs. IRE1 would have preferential distribution in the rough ER. similarities RNaseL IRE1 Inactive state Oligomeric Factor driving oligomerization. Xbp1u and other mRNAs are targeted as part of the RIDD pathway Selection of cleavage site Cleaved between 2nd and 3rd nucleotide positions of UN/N sites. the pathway leading from both these proteins have the potential to lead to cell death. future research would probably lead to design of drugs targeting these proteins based on the structural homology of their effector domains."}
