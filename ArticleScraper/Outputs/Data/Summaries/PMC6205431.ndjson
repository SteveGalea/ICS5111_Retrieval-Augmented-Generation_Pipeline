{"summary": "a model-free framework is proposed to accurately predict future dynamics based on such short-term but high-dimensional data. a case of induced earthquakes in southern Alberta responded to increased pore pressure on a fault in hydraulic communication with the HF operation. the exact means by which stress changes are transferred to seismogenic faults are unknown. people experiencing pain or orgasm produce facial expressions that are indistinguishable, which questions their role as an effective tool for communication. findings inform understanding of the possible communicative role of facial expressions of pain and orgasm, and how culture could shape their representation. nucleoside analogs interact with the catalytic and allosteric sites of SAMHD1. this work contributes to the assessment of SAMHD1 as a potential therapeutic target for cancer therapy and the future design of SAMHD1 modulators that might improve the efficacy of existing therapies. the presence of Dmc1 may help to prevent Srs2 from disruption of early meiotic recombination intermediates. the presence of Dmc1 may help to prevent Srs2 from disrupting early meiotic recombination intermediates. this may in turn favor the formation of cross-over recombination products. mTOR inhibitors lower an intrinsic barrier to virus infection mediated by IFITM3 Guoli Shi, Stosh Ozog, Bruce E. Torbett and Alex A. Compton Gene delivery by virus-like particles holds enormous therapeutic potential to correct inherited genetic disorders. chromosome segregation Ran Xu, Yixi Xu, Wei Huo, Zhicong Lv, Jingsong Yuan, Shaokai Ning, Qingsong Wang, Mei Hou, Ge Gao. hypomorphic mutations in the human MRN complex have been identified in autosomal recessive genetic diseases, ataxia-telangiectasia\u2013like disorder, and Nijmegen breakage syndrome. the transcription factor XBP1s alters N-glycan structures displayed on endogenous membrane-associated and secreted glycoproteins. these results establish a role for the unfolded protein response in defining the global composition of the N-glycome\u2013providing a mechanism for transducing internal stress to an external signal. human leukemia mutations corrupt but do not abrogate GATA-2 function Koichi R. Katsumura, Charu Mehta, Kyle J. Hewitt, Alexandra A. Soukup, Isabela Fraga de Andrade, Erik A. Ranheim, Kirby D. Johnson, and Emery H. Bresnick GATA-2 function in stem and progenitor cells. iNOS promotes CD24+CD133+ liver cancer stem cell phenotype through a TACE/ADAM17-dependent notch signaling pathway. iNOS/NO is associated with more aggressive hepatocellular carcinoma. PTIP is required to maintain normal and leukemic bone marrow niches. deletion of PTIP disrupts the integrity of the BM niche. a PTIP-deficient BM microenvironment decreases the number of acute myeloid leukemia-initiating cells in the BM and increases survival upon transplantation. the absence of MmpL8 (MmpL8MAB) leads to reduced production of a previously unknown glycolipid: a glycosyl diacylated nonadecyl diol (GDND) the glycolipid seems unique to the Mycobacterium chelonae complex, supporting the view that GDND might represent a typical signature of M. abscessus infection. the nonsense-mediated decay pathway also induced the degradation of coV mRNAs that are of cytoplasmic origin. the present study highlights an interplay between the NMD pathway and CoVs that modulates viral replication by controlling the stability of viral mRNAs. the dominant SV recycling mode during intense activity is activity-dependent bulk endocytosis (ADBE), suggesting it will perform a pivotal role in neurotransmission. the role of ADBE is still undetermined due to the absence of identified molecules specific for this process. chronic social defeat (CSD) stress induces lasting peripheral and central hyperglycemia and impaired glucose metabolism in a subgroup of mice. long noncoding RNA GM12371 acts as a transcriptional regulator of synapse function Bindu L. Raveendra, Supriya Swarnkar, Yosef Avchalumov, Xin-An Liu, Eddie Grinman, Kerriann Badal, Adrian Reich, Bruce D. Pascal, and Sathyanarayanan V. Puthanveettil Neuronal functions are poorly understood. the HRF models how local neural activity elicits cerebral blood flow changes. stress replicably shifted the HRF peak in temporal, insular, and prefrontal brain regions. DSCAM promotes self-avoidance in the developing mouse retina. based assessment of function and dysfunction in myelinated axons. fMRI has proven to be extremely powerful for studying brain function. but is essentially limited to applications in gray matter. p38 MAPK signaling drives pharmacologically reversible brain and gastrointestinal phenotypes in the SERT Ala56 mouse. genetic variants in the serotonin transporter (SERT) are linked to ASD. the ghrelin receptor is an attractive target for the development of novel antiobesity drugs. ghrelin increases fat accumulation and food intake. but ghrelin also modulates a variety of additional physiological functions. the previously uncharacterized TREPH1 protein is required for the bolting-delay aspect of the Arabidopsis touch response. these studies suggest that protein phosphorylation and the TREPH1 protein are critical for an aspect of plant thigmomorphogenesis. the proportion of seabed trawled varied >200-fold among regions. within 18 regions, more than two-thirds of seabed area remained untrawled during study periods of 2\u20136 years."}
