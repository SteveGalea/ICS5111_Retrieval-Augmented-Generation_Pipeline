{"summary": "EBOV is an enveloped negative-sense RNA virus in the order Mononegavirales. EBOV is the etiologic agent of a highly lethal hemorrhagic fever with up to 90% mortality. since its discovery in 1976, EBOV has caused sporadic outbreaks in sub-saharan Africa with death tolls. GP1 is encoded in two disjointed reading frames in the virus genome. only about 20% of transcripts are edited, while the remaining 80% of unedited transcripts have a premature stop codon. sGP forms homodimers and appears to have some intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity. sGP induces a host antibody response that focuses on epitopes it shares with GP1,2. sGP induces a host antibody response that focuses on epitopes it shares with GP1,2. sGP can also subvert an existing anti-GP1,2 immune response that was only weakly cross-reactive with sGP. sGP and GP1,2 were secreted into the supernatant through cleavage. dRPs do not edit with the same efficiency as the EBOV RNA polymerase. however, it is possible that the 7-A editing site can also serve as a premature poly-adenylation signal, and a ribosomal slippage signal. mutant GP1,2 is encoded in the EBOV genome in two disjointed reading frames. the GP editing site is a tract of 7 A's approximately 900 nucleotides downstream of the start codon. mutation of the editing site has a significant effect on GP expression. constructs expressing predominantly sGP (GP-7A and sGPEdit) developed much higher titers of anti-sGP antibodies than sGP-binding antibodies. on the other hand, sGP-immunized mice developed much higher titers of sGP-binding antibodies than GP1,2-binding antibodies. these results suggest that in sGP-immunized animals, many sGP-binding antibodies are directed against conformational epitopes average titers of anti-GP1,2 (blue) and anti-sGP (red) antibodies within immunization groups are shown for comparison of the GP isoform reactivity profiles both within and between groups. sGP can compete for binding of anti-GP1,2 antibodies induced by sGP but not by GP1,2. sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from sGP-immunized mice. as expected, GP1,2 was able to compete with itself in all groups. similar reactivity pattern with native membrane-anchored EBOV GP1,2. antiserum from mice immunized against GP1,2 or sGP display different reactivity patterns. 50 ng of purified His-sGP and His-GP1,2 were run by SDS-PAGE. wells were coated with GP1,2 and incubated with pooled antisera. plates were then incubated with HRP-conjugated secondary antibody. sGPEdit antisera was incubated with recombinant HA as a negative control. results are representative of three independent experiments. sGP Differentially interferes with antibody-mediated Viral Neutralization. purified influenza HA was used as a control and had no effect on neutralizing activity of either antiserum group. similar results were observed when we used an antiserum dilution corresponding to 50% neutralizing activity. sGP can compete with GP1,2 for anti-GP1,2 antibodies. the inability of sGP to compete with GP1,2 for antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice was intriguing considering that GP1,2 shares almost half of its ectodomain sequence with sGP. we reasoned that some of these antibodies may be directed solely against GP1,2 epitopes not shared with sGP, while other antibodies may be directed against shared epitopes. in mice immunized against sGP we again observed very high titers of anti-sGP antibodies, and very low levels of anti-GP1,2 antibodies. however, those antibodies that did bind to GP1,2 appeared to have modestly lower Kd (higher average affinity) than did sGP-binding antibodies. sGP can only compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies in mice immunized against sGP. this led us to hypothesize that sGP may alter the repertoire of epitopes against which the host immune response is directed, in order to divert the host immune response towards epitopes shared between sGP and GP1. antiserum from sGPEdit+ GP1,2Edit-immunized mice was able to precipitate both GP1,2 and sGP. the addition of exogenous sGP almost completely inhibited pseudovirus neutralization. sGP can effectively interfere with antibody mediated neutralization in these mice. sGP can direct the host antibody response to focus on epitopes shared between GP1,2 and sGP. iterative exposure to sGP gradually drives the host to a dominantly sGP-reactive response. female mice were immunized IM with 50 g of total DNA per immunization. pooled antisera from sGPEdit+GP1,2Edit-immunized mice were incubated with no GP, purified sGP or GP1,2 alone, or with fixed GP1,2 and increasing concentrations of sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies. sGP can subvert the GP1,2-specific antibody response. anti-GP1,2 antibodies were induced in all groups at week 12. but in mice immunized with GP1,2Edit and then boosted with sGPEdit, sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies in competition ELISA. sGP was also able to interfere with virus neutralization by sera from cross primed and boosted mice. two groups of mice (n = 12) were primed and boosted as in previous experiments with either sGP Edit or GP1,2 Edit in pCAGGS vector. each group was divided in two and subgroups were boosted at week 10 with either the same construct against which they had initially been immunized. the ability of sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies was determined by competition ELISA as described in Figure 3B. neutralization activity (NT50) were calculated for week 6 (fine checkered) and week 12 (coarse checkered) mice. Error bars correspond to 95% confidence interval as determined by Student's t-test. EBOV directs the synthesis of sGP and GP1,2 through differentially edited mRNA transcripts. GP1,2Edit produced higher amounts of GP1,2 than GP-8A. GP-7A and sGPEdit expressed high levels of sGP. mutation of editing site has significant effect on GP expression. mice immunized with constructs expressing predominantly sGP developed much higher titers of anti-sGP antibodies than mice immunized with constructs expressing predominantly sGP. sGP-immunized mice developed much higher titers of sGP-binding antibodies than sGP-binding antibodies. sGP-immunized mice developed much higher titers of sGP-binding antibodies than sGP-binding antibodies. antibody concentration was determined from a standard curve and expressed as g/mL of anti-GP IgG. average titers of anti-GP1,2 (blue) and anti-sGP (red) antibodies within immunization groups are shown for comparison of the GP isoform reactivity profiles within and between groups. sGP was unable to compete for binding of anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2 mice. sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from sGP-immunized mice. sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from sGP-immunized mice. anti-GP1,2 antibodies induced by GP1,2 are directed against epitopes not shared between GP1,2 and sGP. such antibodies are directed against epitopes shared between GP1,2 and sGP. antiserum from mice immunized against GP1,2 or sGP display different reactivity patterns. pooled antisera from GP1,2Edit-immunized mice (E) or sGP-immunized mice (F) were incubated with no GP, purified sGP or GP1,2 alone, or with fixed GP1,2 and increasing concentrations of sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies. results are representative of three independent experiments. sGP was able to completely attenuate neutralizing activity of antisera from sGP-immunized mice. it had no effect on neutralizing activity of either antiserum group. similar results were observed when we used an antiserum dilution. pooled GP1,2-immunized (blue) and sGP-immunized (red) antisera were fixed at the dilution corresponding to 80% neutralization. antisera was co-incubated with increasing dilutions of His-tagged sGP (solid markers) or His-tagged influenza PR8 HA (open markers) mice immunized against GP1,2 had higher titers of anti-GP1,2 antibodies than anti-sGP antibodies. however, there was no measurable difference in apparent Kd's of GP1,2-binding vs. sGP-binding antibodies. expression of GP1,2 in the Context of sGP Allows sGP to Compete for Anti-GP1,2 Antibodies. expression of GP1,2 in the Context of sGP allows sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies in mice immunized against sGP. this led us to hypothesize that sGP may alter the repertoire of epitopes against which the host immune response is directed. the levels of sGP and GP1,2 expression in both lysate and culture supernatant were similar to cells transfected with sGPEdit or GP1,2Edit alone. sGP was able to compete with GP1,2 for over 50% of the anti-GP1,2 antibodies. sGP can effectively neutralize pseudovirus infectivity. the addition of exogenous sGP almost completely inhibited pseudovirus neutralization. sGP can direct the host antibody response to focus on epitopes shared between GP1,2 and sGP. pooled antisera from sGPEdit+GP1,2Edit-immunized mice were incubated with no GP, purified sGP or GP1,2 alone. pooled antisera from sGPEdit+GP1,2Edit-immunized mice were incubated with no GP, purified sGP or GP1,2 alone. sGP can subvert the GP1,2-specific antibody response. we primed and boosted mice with either sGPEdit or GP1,2Edit. sGP was able to efficiently compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies in competition ELISA. female BALB/C mice were immunized IM with 50 g of total DNA per immunization according to the schedule. each group was divided in two and subgroups were boosted at week 10 with either the same construct against which they had initially been immunized. sGP competition ELISA determined the ability of sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies. antiserum titers corresponding to 50% pseudovirus neutralization activity (NT50) were calculated for week 6 (fine checkered) and week 12 (coarse checkered) mice. Error bars correspond to 95% confidence interval as determined by Student's t-test. in mice immunized against GP1,2 alone, we observed only low cross-reactivity of anti-GP1,2 antibodies with sGP. the model we propose for the mechanism of antigenic subversion by sGP assumes that before immunization, the host begins with a repertoire of nave B-cells that recognize epitopes distributed throughout GP1,2 and sGP. however, as the sGP-reactive B-cell population expands, it will outcompete other B sGP-reactive B-cells preferentially expand and outcompete GP1,2-specific B-cells for antigen and survival signals. this process does not require temporal separation of antigen encounters. regions of GP1,2 that are shared with sGP are in red and unshared epitopes are in green. prior immunization by GP1,2 results in antibodies against sGP epitopes not shared with sGP. memory B-cells that recognize shared epitopes encounter antigen and expand. non-cross-reactive GP1,2-specific B-cells are not boosted before subversion can occur. boosting GP1,2-immunized mice with sGP could effectively subvert the anti-GP1,2 response and render it susceptible to competition by sGP. this is supported by our observation that even though sGP cannot measurably compete in ELISA and immunoprecipitation for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice. inability of sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies from GP1,2-immunized mice is consistent with growing body of evidence pointing to the immunodominance of the GP1,2 mucin domain. this domain is thought to form a sterically bulky \u201ccloak\u201d that shields the putative receptor binding domain from host antibodies. the mucin domain is the most divergent region of GP1,2 among EBOV strains. sGP-crossreactive antibodies in sGP-immunized mice cross-react with GP1,2. antigenic subversion allows sGP to efficiently absorb those antibodies that recognize unshielded and shared epitopes in GP1,2. this is particularly important given that passive transfer of anti-EBOV monoclonal antibodies has gained traction recently. s may need to be focused on regions of GP1,2 that are highly conserved and unshared with sGP. it will be of great interest for EBOV vaccinology to determine whether antigenic subversion correlates with successes and failures of vaccines to protect animals against lethal challenge. MARV, a paramyxovirus that causes severe respiratory tract infections in rodents, expresses a V protein via RNA editing of the P gene. the closely related human parainfluenza virus type 1 (HPIV-1) does not express V, even though its P gene displays a high degree of homology to SeV P. animal ethics approval for immunization studies in mice was obtained from the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) at Emory University. female BALB/c mice (8-week old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory. cell lysate and concentrated cell culture supernatant were run on SDS-PAGE under denaturing conditions, followed by probing with anti-EBOV GP1,2/sGP rabbit polyclonal antibody. purity was verified by restriction analysis and spectrophotometry. female BALB/C mice received 50 g of DNA intramuscularly (25 g/leg) per group. ELISA and Western blot tested purified His-GP1,2 and His-sGP for reactivity to pre-immune sera or sera from unvaccinated mice. a standard curve was generated by coating control wells with known concentrations of mouse IgG. plates were washed 5 in PBS+Tween (PBST), blocked in PBST+2%BSA, then incubated in duplicate for two hours with antisera diluted in PBST+2%BS competition immunoprecipitation was performed by incubating pooled antisera with 200 ng of purified His- GP1,2 and increasing amounts purified His-sGP at molar ratios. antisera incubated with His-sGP alone, His-GP1,2 alone, or with no GP were used as controls, as well as antisera incubated with GP1,2 in presence of recombinant influenza HA. we titrated the amount of coating antigen down to 0.05 g/well to avoid signal saturation. wells were coated overnight with 0.05 g of purified His-GP1,2 or His-sGP. after washing and blocking were incubated with purified IgG diluted in PBST+2%BSA. luciferase reporter assay measured neutralization by decreasing luciferase expression compared to virus-only controls. antisera mixtures were mixed with pseudovirus and the neutralization assay was developed. all Ebola glycoprotein constructs were based on the Ebola Zaire strain (ZEBOV), Mayinga Subtype (GenBank accession# U23187.1). Constructs were then subcloned pCAGGS mammalian expression vector. protein expression was carried out by transfecting 90% confluent cells. anesthetized mice were bled retro-orbitally two weeks after each immunization. serum samples were stored at 80\u00b0C until use. rVV-infected cell supernatant was clarified and purified using a prepEase His Purification Kit. plates were washed again, and incubated with 11000 (pooled anti- IgG subtype) HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody. plates were read and antibody concentration was calculated using the standard curve. competition was calculated as percent of signal compared to no competing antigen. quantitative affinity ELISA requires coating antigen be incubated with increasing dilutions of antibodies until coating antigen becomes saturated. wells were coated overnight with 0.05 g of purified His-GP1,2 or His-sGP. after washing and blocking were incubated with purified IgG diluted in PBST+2%BSA. supernatants were harvested 48 h post-transfection, clarified, and filtered using a 0.45 micron filter. pseudoviruses were pre-incubated with dilutions of heat-inactivated antisera. antisera mixtures were mixed with pseudovirus and the neutralization assay was developed. cells were seeded in a 96-well plate and allowed to grow overnight to 100% confluency. cells were then infected with a recombinant vaccinia virus that directs infected cells to express membrane-bound EBOV GP1,2. at 24 h post-infection, cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and washed in PBS. antigen expression from DNA vaccines is too low to detect in vivo. we measured expression in cell culture as a proxy for in vivo expression. expression of sGP and GP1,2 was determined 36 h post-transfection. sGP to compete for anti-GP1,2 antibodies was determined by competition ELISA. expression of sGP and GP1,2 was determined 36 h post-transfection. both cell lysate and culture supernatant were analysed by Western blot."}
