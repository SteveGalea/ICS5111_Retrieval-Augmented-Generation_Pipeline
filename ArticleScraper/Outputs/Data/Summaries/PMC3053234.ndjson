{"summary": "antimicrobial resistance is an important concern in animal health. treatment causes selective pressure that can trigger the selection of resistant bacteria. administration of antimicrobial agents used in human medicine to production animals, such as fluoroquinolones, could lead to public health issues. study highlighted the need for a modelling framework which incorporates current knowledge of the epidemiology of antimicrobial resistance in animals. knowledge of the transmission dynamics of resistant bacteria would improve the understanding of the influence of on-site farming practices on the dynamics of resistant bacteria in animals. transmission parameters were estimated by applying a maximum likelihood method. pigs were housed on flat decks, with a fully slatted floor one metre above the floor of the facility. the suspension consisted of a ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli in vitro selected from the faecal flora of a fully susceptible E. coli strain isolated from pigs of the same herd. the minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin was 1.5 mg/L. the experiment was ended two weeks after inoculation. a stochastic SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) model was used to estimate transmission parameters. pigs were classified as susceptible or infectious according to the quantities of resistant bacteria recorded in individual faecal samples. individuals were considered susceptible when the quantity of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli was below a threshold level (T1), fixed at 5*103 CFU/g in accordance with literature data. the model obtained under the third hypothesis (H3) could be considered as the full model with three transmission parameters: L, M and H. the second hypothesis (H2) being a simplification of this model in which L = M, and the first hypothesis (H1) derived from the latter by assigning equal values to all the transmission parameters (L = M = H) dj the duration of the interval between two sampling times, and where log ( S j C j ) is omitted because it plays no role in the calculations. the different parameters were estimated using the inverse of the Hessian matrix (variance/covariance matrix) of parameter estimates. the bacterial suspension consisted of a ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli in vitro selected from the faecal flora of a fully susceptible E. coli strain isolated from SPF pigs of the same herd. the minimum inhibitory concentration of ciprofloxacin for the selected resistant strain was 1.5 mg/L. the experiments were incubated at 37\u00b0C for 24 h then the colonies were counted. the method allowed quantification of the concentrations of inoculated E. coli greater than or equal to 102 CFU/g of faeces. infected is given by SI/N, where is the transmission parameter, defined as the mean number of new infections caused by a typical infectious individual per unit of time. pigs were classified as susceptible or infectious according to the quantities of resistant bacteria recorded in individual faecal samples. changes in individual status observed between two sampling dates, either from susceptible to infectious or reciprocally, were considered to occur. hypothesis 2, the bacterial counts exceeded 106 CFU/g (IH) the third hypothesis (H3) could be considered as the full model with three transmission parameters: L, M and H, the second hypothesis (H2) being a simplification of this model in which L = M, and the first hypothesis (H1) derived from the latter by assigning equal values to all the transmission parameters (L = M = H) dj the duration of the interval between two sampling times, and where log ( S j C j ) is omitted because it plays no role in the calculations. Confidence intervals were determined using the inverse of the Hessian matrix (variance/covariance matrix) of parameter estimates, also provided by nlm function in R software. nineteen out of 28 contact pigs had positive bacterial counts on day 1 post-contact. an overall decrease in bacterial counts was observed until the 6th day post-contact. no significant difference was found in individual bacterial counts. n = 7: 3 inoculated and 4 nave pigs, n = 8: 4 inoculated pigs in contact with 4 nave pigs. the resistant strain could not be detected on D10 in only three pigs. only 7 of these high-shedders still showed high shedding levels. hypothesis* Parameters AIC L (CI) M (CI) H (CI) H1 0.55 (0.40; 0.74) - 121.00 H2 0.41 (0.27; 0.62) - 0.98 (0.59; 1.62) 117.85 H3 0.41 (0.23; 0.71) 0.42 (0.15;1.19) 0.98 (0.59; 1.62) 119.85 * Hypothesis on the relationship between bacterial counts and transmission efficiency: H1. individual bacterial counts in inoculated pigs increased until day 1 post-contact. the bacterial counts of the inoculated pigs then decreased over a period of 3 to 5 days. an inverse trend was observed in 13 of the 23 inoculated pigs between day 4 and day 10 post-contact. all but 5 inoculated pigs (18/23) had bacterial counts over 106 CFU/g on D0 and D1. only 7 of these high-shedders still showed high shedding levels on day 2 post-contact. the estimated transmission of low-shedders, in this model, was 2.5 times less efficient than that of high-shedders. these estimates were not modified by introducing an intermediate transmission level (H3), corresponding to pigs shedding more than 105 and less than 106 CFU/g. study was designed to assess the horizontal transmission of a fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli within a swine population. the transmission of resistant commensal bacteria between individuals could be a pivotal factor governing persistence within a pig herd. all nave contact pigs had positive counts of fluoroquinolone-resistant E. coli after only two days of contact. a 4- to 5-day decline in bacterial counts in the faeces of inoculated pigs showed the strong infectious pressure exerted by inoculated animals. transmission rates could be influenced by several factors such as time-since-infection. the role of super-spreaders was clearly identified for different infectious agents. a modelling approach would require representing the within-host dynamics of the bacterial population accounting for different susceptibility levels."}
