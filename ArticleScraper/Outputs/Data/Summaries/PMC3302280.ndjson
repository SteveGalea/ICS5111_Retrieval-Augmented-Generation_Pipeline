{"summary": "all positive-strand RNA (+RNA) viruses characterized to date induce the formation of dedicated membrane structures to support the cytoplasmic replication of their RNA genomes. the formation of these membranous compartments offers important functional and/or strategic benefits for the viral RNA-synthesizing machinery. es in endosomal and lysosomal membranes showed similar invaginations. but in this case, ER membranes serve as platforms for the biogenesis of the replication structures. the accumulation of different membrane structures was also documented for picornaviruses and coronaviruses. the 5\u2032-terminal open reading frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b in the 12.7-kb EAV genome encode the replicase polyproteins pp1a (1,727 amino acids [aa]) and pp1ab (3,175 aa) the latter is a C-terminally extended version of the former that is derived from a ribosomal frameshifting mechanism. the key enzymes of the arterivirus replication and transcription complex ( cryoimmobilization is faster and has been shown to provide better morphology and improved membrane contrast in a large variety of specimens (39). using direct CF and a combination of advanced microscopy techniques, we have performed an in-depth characterization of EAV-infected cells and established some striking parallels between arteriviruses and coronaviruses. infected cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at various time points after infection. single- or dual-labeling IF assays were carried out with rabbit antisera and/or mouse monoclonal antibodies. an IgG fraction was isolated from the anti-nsp3 antiserum for direct coupling to Alexa Fluor 488. cell monolayers adhered to sapphire discs (Leica) were frozen using a leica EM PACT2 high-pressure freezer. FS was performed in anhydrous acetone containing 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 0.1% uranyl acetate for nsp and N protein labeling. a bridging rabbit anti-mouse antibody was used when the primary antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody. a bridging rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody (DakoCytomation) was used when the primary antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody. 15 circles were used to quantify the amount of immunogold labeling in the extracellular space, nucleus, cytosol, mitochondrion-containing areas, and RVN-containing areas. in all labelings, 10-nm colloidal gold particles conjugated to protein A were used for detection of the primary antibodies. immunogold-labeling experiments using antibodies recognizing nsp3, nsp9, dsRNA, and N protein were counted. for each labeling, the gold beads inside different cellular compartments (n = 3) were counted, and means and standard deviations are shown. a suspension of 10-nm gold particles was layered on top of the sections as fiducial markers. a Tecnai 12 BioTwin electron microscope was equipped with a postcolumn electron image filter (Gatan) images at different magnifications were acquired at 80 kV, with the aim of retrieving the same area after transferring the specimen to a Tecnai 12 BioTwin electron microscope running at 200 kV. a total of 64 images were recorded at 2\u00b0 increments between tilt angles of 63\u00b0 to +63\u00b0. for each tilt angle, 5 images were acquired with a cooled slow-scan charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera (2k GIF; Gatan) in 2-by-2 binned mode. electron microscope magnification was 19,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 2.7 nm at the specimen level. infected cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed with 3% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at various time points after infection. single- or dual-labeling IF assays were carried out with rabbit antisera and/or mouse monoclonal antibodies. an IgG fraction was isolated from the anti-nsp3 antiserum. cell monolayers adhered to sapphire discs were frozen using a leica EM PACT2 high-pressure freezer. FS was carried out in an automated FS system (Leica) using a medium consisting of 2% osmium tetroxide, 1% glutaraldehyde and 10% H2O in acetone. samples were infiltrated with lowicryl HM20 (Electron Microscopy Sciences) and polymerized under UV light at 50\u00b0C. a bridging rabbit anti-mouse IgG antibody was used when the primary antibody was a mouse monoclonal antibody. 15 such circles were used to quantify the amount of immunogold labeling in the extracellular space, nucleus, cytosol, mitochondrion-containing areas, and RVN-containing areas. in all labelings, 10-nm colloidal gold particles conjugated to protein A were used for detection of the primary antibodies. label was predominantly found on DMV membranes and their surroundings. freeze-substituted infected cell samples were used to cut 200-nm-thick sections. serial sections were placed side by side on Formvar/carbon-coated grids. a suspension of 10-nm gold particles was layered on top of the sections as fiducial markers. images at different magnifications were acquired at 80 kV, with the aim of retrieving the same area. pre- and post-edge images were acquired at an energy loss of 120 and 157 eV, respectively, with a slit width of 15 eV (27). to improve the signal-to-noise ratio, we averaged 5 images recorded with an exposure time of 1 min each. electron microscope magnification was 19,000, corresponding to a pixel size of 2.7 nm at the specimen level. the pre-edge tilt series was aligned using fiducial markers and the IMOD software package (26) a reconstruction was computed using 25 iterations of the simultaneous iterative reconstruction technique (SIRT) algorithm implemented in IMOD (17). immunofluorescence analysis of EAV-infected cells was done using rabbit antisera recognizing different replicase subunits and a mouse monoclonal antibody specific for dsRNA. at 4 h p.i., the early signals for dsRNA and both nsps were found in close proximity to each other and partially overlapping. at later time points, the early signals for dsRNA and both nsps were found in close proximity to each other manders overlap coefficients range from 0 to 1 representing full separation and complete colocalization of signals. the first labeling of foci for nsp3, nsp9, or dsRNA could be detected in the perinuclear areas of infected cells by 3 h p.i., and by 4 h p.i., most cells were positive. the 4-h p.i. time point was found to mark the start of a rapid increase in localization of viral replicase and dsRNA was very limited (Fig. 1B) nsps and dsRNA was quantified at three different time points by calculating the Manders overlap coefficient (Fig. 1E) for each double labeling. dsRNA and replicase, in particular nsp9, exceeded this threshold by 4 h p.i. DMVs with a (largely) electron-lucent interior as the most prominent virus-induced membrane structures. the ER as the most likely platform for their generation (41, 51) the ER is the most likely platform for their generation (41, 51) high-pressure freezing, limiting ice crystal expansion by pressurizing samples to 2 108 Pa prior to freezing, is believed to minimize this problem. the overall ultrastructural preservation of EAV-infected cells was significantly improved compared to plunge frozen samples. the lipid bilayers of DMVs are recognizable, and the cytosol was free of freezing artifacts. the interiors of DMVs prepared by HPF were visualized as electron-dense cores surrounded by electron-lucent halos. the images show a 10-nm slice through the tomographic reconstruction of 200-nm-thick resin-embedded sections. along with DMVs (brown), cores (blue), ER (beige), EAV tubules (green), smooth-walled vesicles (V; yellow), multivesicular body (MVB; blue-gray) and actin filaments (A; purple) are depicted. arrows indicate connections of outer membranes with the ER (D), other DMVs (E) and curved double-membrane structures (F) coronaviruses were concluded to be integrated into a reticulovesicular network that also includes convoluted membranes. at 4 h p.i., clusters of DMVs were distributed throughout the cytoplasm. by 7 h p.i., the number of vesicles per cluster had dramatically increased. by 7 h p.i., in addition to the developing virus-induced membrane compartments, unusual tubular structures were observed in their immediate vicinity. EAV-infected Vero E6 cells were fixed at various time points after infection. by 4 h p.i., nsp3 signal was visible in most of the infected cells. by 10 h p.i., N protein signal became detectable in most cells by 7 h p.i. the arrows indicate areas where the tubules or membranes run in parallel with the electron beam. the arrows indicate areas where the tubules run in parallel with the electron beam and thus contain the maximum resolution in x and y. outer membranes of EAV DMVs (n = 500) were continuous with rough ER membranes (Fig. 3D and H) (34%), each other (Fig. 3E and I) (14%), or paired membrane structures (Fig. 3F and J; see Video S1 in the supplemental material) or were found to have combination of the above connections (46%) these connections were sometimes hard to visualize in HPF samples. for at least 91% of these vesicles, both membranes appeared to be fully intact. only some of the larger vesicles showed membrane discontinuities that could be interpreted as connections to the cytosol. similar openings were occasionally detected in the membranes of host cell organelles like the ER, suggesting that they are more likely explained by technical issues. the dsRNA labeling in EAV-infected cells was almost exclusively associated with the interior of the DMVs. in these cases, ET analysis of serial sections revealed an association with the contents of \u201cobscured DMVs\u201d that had been cut tangentially and, for the most part, resided in an adjacent section. the labeling for nsp3, nps9, and dsRNA was specifically associated with the RVN/DMV-containing areas. the high-magnification images of the RVN-containing areas further confirmed the specific association of the dsRNA labeling with the DMV core structure. previous arterivirus studies suggested that these tubules contain the viral nucleocapsid protein. at 7 h p.i., the signal overlapped with nsp3, a marker for the replication structures (Fig. 5A, close-ups I and II, arrows) in cells still containing little N protein, the signal overlapped with nsp3. a small fraction was found in close association with DMV membranes. hepatitis c virus establishes about 100 replication complexes per cell. hepatitis c virus requires only a few percent of the available nonstructural proteins. we applied the EM-based method of electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) to the EAV-induced DMVs. EAV-infected cells were high-pressure frozen at 8 h p.i., freeze-substituted in acetone containing 1% glutaraldehyde, and cut into 60-nm-thick sections. contrast of the sample was very low, but DMVs were easily recognized by their cores. Phosphorus maps were obtained by acquisition of pre-edge (B) and post-edge (C) images at 120- and 157-eV electron loss, respectively, with a 15-eV slit width. an ESI tomogram was recorded at the P energy edge, and direct volume rendering was used to visualize the P content in 3-D. d P signal measured for 25 ribosomes, each containing 7,128 nucleotides of rRNA. the density of the P signal was higher in ribosomes, suggesting that ribosomal RNAs are packed more densely than the RNA within the EAV-induced DMVs. the first application of ESI to virus-infected cells established the potential of this novel tool. mock-infected control cells were used to confirm the high specificity of each of the three antibodies. EAV-infected Vero E6 cells were fixed at various time points after infection. they were processed for IF assays using rabbit antisera. the intensity of the signals started to increase exponentially between 3 and 4 h p.i. and peaked at 9 h p.i. the error bars indicate standard deviations. by definition, manders overlap coefficients range from 0 to 1 representing full separation and complete colocalization of signals. the number of dsRNA-positive foci had increased by 7 and 10 h p.i., although the labeling intensities of the individual foci were quite comparable (Fig. 1A and B, insets). the most striking observation was the fact that the colocalization of viral RdRp and dsRNA was very limited. high-pressure cryofixation reveals a compact core structure in EAV-infected cells. paired membranes and DMVs with a (largely) electron-lucent interior are the most prominent virus-induced membrane structures. the ER is the most likely platform for their generation (41, 51) the overall ultrastructural preservation of EAV-infected cells was significantly improved compared to plunge frozen samples. only in samples was the DMV interior visualized as an electron-dense, roughly spherical mass, which was separated from the inner DMV membrane by an electron-lucent \u201chalo\u201d this compact core structure was never observed in cells that had been chemically fixed or plunge frozen. the lipid bilayers of the DMVs are recognizable, and the double membranes are difficult to discern. the lipid bilayers of the DMVs are recognizable, and the DMV interior has a more granular appearance. the cytosol surrounding the DMV cluster contained electron-lucent areas. the images show a 10-nm slice through the tomographic reconstruction of 200-nm-thick resin-embedded sections. a subvolume of 250 (x) by 250 (y) by 10 (z) pixels was extracted from the central part of the DMV and merged into a single image representing a 12-nm-thick section through the middle of the DMV. arrows indicate connections of outer membranes with the ER (D), other DMVs (E) and curved double-membrane structures (F). arrows indicate connections of outer membranes with the ER (D), other DMVs (E) and curved double-membrane structures. ick sections were cut to analyze the EAV replication structures in successive sections cut from the same cell. this technique also allowed us to produce tomograms from the same relative position, i.e., the center of the region containing replication compartments. by 7 h p.i., the number of vesicles per cluster had dramatically increased. ER of EAV-infected Vero E6 cells was dilated, which appeared to promote the dispersal of both DMVs and tubules. by 4 h p.i., nsp3 signal was visible in most of the infected cells, but N protein was not yet detectable. dimensional ET reconstruction illustrating the distribution and architecture of the EAV tubules (depicted in green) and proximity of DMVs (depicted in brown, with cores in blue) and the ER (beige) arrows indicate areas where the tubules or membranes run in parallel with the electron beam and thus contain the maximum resolution. outer membranes of EAV DMVs (n = 500) were found to be continuous with rough ER membranes (n = 500), each other (Fig. 3E and I) or paired membrane structures (14%) or were found to have combination of the above connections (46%) the presence of ribosomes on the cytosolic face of EAV DMVs strongly suggested that their outer membranes are indeed derived from the rough ER. despite an extensive ET analysis, such connections could not be identified in the case of the SARS-CoV-induced DMVs (23). we therefore scrutinized EAV-induced DMVs (n = 888, from five different tomograms of HPF samples representing four different time points after infection) for the presence of membrane discontinuities (diameter > 4 nm) that might constitute a connection to the cytosol. p9 RdRp and the nsp11 endoribonuclease are associated with the virus-induced membrane network but are rarely detected in the interior of the DMVs. dsRNA labeling in EAV-infected cells was almost exclusively associated with the interior of the DMVs. in these cases, ET analysis of serial sections revealed an association with the contents of obscured DMVs. drion-containing areas were defined as perinuclear areas with high electron density that did not contain mitochondria. the last were defined as perinuclear areas with high electron density that did not contain mitochondria. dsRNA labeling was specifically associated with the RVN/DMV-containing areas. at 4 h p.i., nsp3 signal was visible in most of the infected cells. however, nsp3 signal was not yet detectable in any of them. in cells still containing little N protein, signal overlapped with nsp3. hepatitis C virus establishes about 100 replication complexes per cell. a single electron-dense layer rather than the well-known bilayer profile of a lipid membrane. this strongly suggested that these structures constitute protein sheets rather than membranes. EAV-infected cells were high-pressure frozen at 8 h p.i., freeze-substituted in acetone containing 1% glutaraldehyde, and cut into 60-nm-thick sections. ESI could be used to visualize DMV cores and assess their RNA content on the basis of the P signal. Phosphorus elemental maps were obtained by acquisition of pre-edge (B) and post-edge (C) images at 120- and 157-eV electron loss, respectively, with a 15-eV slit width. an ESI tomogram was recorded at the P energy edge, and direct volume rendering was used to visualize the P content in 3-D. osomes, which were clearly visible in the cytosol, were used to calibrate the P measurements on the basis of their known RNA contents. after correction for background signal, the P measurements of 11 DMV cores were compared to the averaged P signal measured for 25 ribosomes. this revealed thread-like structures that did not appear to extend into the cytosol. the analysis of the biogenesis and function of +RNA virus replication structures is critical to assess parallels and differences between virus families. despite the 27-fold-smaller volume, on average, of arterivirus-induced DMVs, important parallels were observed with coronavirus replication structures (23, 59) the morphology of individual DMVs at 10 h p.i. seemed indistinguishable from those found at earlier time points. the use of HPF can dramatically alter the appearance of viral replication structures, like DMVs. expression of nsp2 and nsp3 induces the formation of DMV-like structures. the exact site of nidovirus RNA synthesis in infected cells remains to be pinpointed. the overall nidovirus nsp localization in the infected cell is unlikely to reflect the position and abundance of active RTCs. this assumption remains to be supported by approaches allowing the in situ analysis of viral RNA synthesis in a much shorter time the mechanism of inner-vesicle formation remains as obscure as it is for coronaviruses. the interiors of the membrane invaginations induced by noda-, alpha-, and flaviviruses were found to be connected to the cytosol. this finding is difficult to reconcile with the accumulation of dsRNA inside these structures and with in vitro studies with isolated RTCs. the 11 DMV cores analyzed were found to have an average P content. this is equivalent to about a dozen RNA molecules of the size of the EAV genome (12.7 kb) future experiments will be aimed at confirming the viral nature of these molecules. our EM analysis strongly suggests the absence of lipid membranes in these structures. the electron density of the tubules in our tomograms was significantly higher than the density of structures known to be solely composed of proteins, like microtubules. recent cryo EM studies on the structure of the arterivirus procine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus describe the core of that virion as a double-layered hollow structure. this diameter is remarkably close to the average tubule diameter for EAV-induced tubules reported by Wada et al. (63) and our own measurements in this study. the analysis of the biogenesis and function of +RNA virus replication structures is critical to assess parallels and differences between virus families. the combination of HPF and ET was used to define the 3-D architecture of an EAV-induced RVN of modified ER. some striking parallels were observed with coronavirus replication structures (23, 59) the morphology of individual DMVs at 10 h p.i. seemed indistinguishable from those found at earlier time points. the use of HPF can dramatically alter the appearance of viral replication structures, like DMVs. the absence of virus replication, expression of nsp2 and nsp3 induces the formation of DMV-like structures. the exact site of nidovirus RNA synthesis in infected cells remains to be pinpointed. the overall nidovirus nsp localization in the infected cell is unlikely to reflect the position and abundance of active RTCs. the interiors of the membrane invaginations induced by noda-, alpha-, and flaviviruses were found to be connected to the cytosol (18, 25, 65) this finding is difficult to reconcile with the accumulation of dsRNA, the presumed intermediate and marker of viral RNA synthesis, inside these structures and with in vitro studies with isolated RTCs. the 11 DMV cores analyzed were found to have an average P content. this is equivalent to about a dozen RNA molecules of the size of the EAV genome (12.7 kb) future experiments will be aimed at confirming the viral nature of these molecules. arterivirus-induced RVN and nucleocapsid assembly has not been studied in much detail so far. our EM analysis strongly suggests the absence of lipid membranes in these structures. the electron density of the tubules in our tomograms was significantly higher than the density of structures known solely composed of proteins, like microtubules. recent cryo EM studies on the structure of the arterivirus procine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus describe the core of that virion as a double-layered hollow structure. this diameter is remarkably close to the average tubule diameter for EAV-induced tubules reported by Wada et al.
