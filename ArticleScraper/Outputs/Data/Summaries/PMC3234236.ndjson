{"summary": "it is believed that the bat-derived SCoV-like CoV underwent several mutations enabling the virus to cross the species barrier and replicate efficiently in humans. the previous SARS outbreak made it apparent that coVs, which usually cause only mild or moderate self-limiting symptoms in healthy humans, can cause a severe epidemic disease. the viral genome consists of a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA of 29.7 kb in length. the polyproteins are cleaved into 16 mature non-structural proteins. most of the non-structural proteins are involved in viral RNA synthesis. major viral structural proteins encode downstream of the ORF1a/1b. nsp1 prevents type I interferon production in infected cells. nsp1 of a closely related mouse hepatitis virus suppresses host gene expression. nsp1 does not induce RNA cleavage in the IRES region of dicistronic RNA transcripts containing either the hepatitis C virus (HCV) IRES or the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) IRES. the molecular basis for the nsp1-mediated selective endonucleolytic RNA cleavage is unclear. dicistronic mRNAs carrying different IRESes to nsp1-induced RNA cleavage were resistant to the nsp1-induced RNA modification. nsp1 does not induce RNA cleavage in similar dicistronic RNA transcripts carrying the HCV IRES. nsp1 does not induce RNA cleavage in similar dicistronic RNA transcripts carrying the HCV IRES. EMCV, HCV and CrPV belong to the picornavirus family, flavivirus family and dicistrovirus family. IRES elements within the same IRES group display a high homology in RNA secondary structures. picornavirus type I IRESes include IRESes derived from poliovirus, coxsackie B virus and human rhinovirus. expression of the upstream rluc ORF was mediated by cap-dependent translation and the translation of downstream fluc ORF driven by the IRES. the transcripts were incubated in RRL with a recombinant nsp1 protein, which was initially expressed as glutathione S-transferase (GST)-nsp1 fusion protein in E. coli. the GST tag was eliminated. RNA 1 containing the region from the 5\u2032-end to the 3\u2032-end of the inter-cistronic region of the template. incubation of all RNA transcripts with GST or nsp1-mt did not induce RNA cleavage. nsp1 induced an endonucleolytic cleavage near the 3\u2032-end of TMEV IRES. dicistronic transcripts carrying picornavirus type I IRES migrated slightly faster than did the RNA 1 markers in the gels. the size difference between the 5\u2032 fragment of Ren-HRV2-FF and the RNA 1 maker was less prominent than those between the 5\u2032 fragment of Ren-PV-FF or Ren-CVB-FF and their RNA 1 makers. nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in RNA transcripts carrying the TMEV IRES or poliovirus IRES. expressed RNAs most likely underwent nsp1-induced modification near the 5\u2032 end. nsp1 expression reduced the abundance of the expressed RNA transcripts in nsp1-expressing cells. onucleolytic RNA cleavage sites in Ren-EMCV-FF and Ren-PV-FF are well characterized. nsp1 induced several endonucleolytic RNA cleavages at or near the ribosome loading site of the EMCV. in vitro-synthesized Ren-EMCV-FF (A) and Ren-PV-FF (B) were incubated with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt in RRL (A) and RRL+HeLa (B), respectively. the RNAs were extracted and subjected to primer extension analysis by using the 5\u2032-end 32P labeled primer that binds at 100 nt downstream of the fluc initiation codon region the underlined AUG triplet is equivalent to the translation initiation codon AUG-834 in the EMCV genome (C) the boxed AUG triplet is equivalent to the boxed AUG-586 of the poliovirus genome. the RNA cleavage is 100-200 nt upstream of the initiation codon of the downstream fluc ORF of Ren-PV-FF. we did not detect major primer extension termination products near AUG-743 following the use of another primer that binds 100 nt downstream of the AUG-743. this data strongly suggested that nsp1 induced RNA modification of capped non-viral mRNAs. the nature of the nsp1-induced modification, which causes primer extension terminations, in the rluc RNA is unknown. mRNAs have 5\u2032 UTRs ranging from 20-100 nt in length. -actin mRNA carrying an 84 nt-long 5\u2032 UTR are two of the host mRNAs. capped and polyadenylated mRNAs were used to characterize nsp1-mediated RNA modification. a major RNA modification site 4 and a minor RNA modification site 5 of GLA mRNA were detected in close proximity to one another within a stem region of a predicted stem-loop structure. rluc reporter activities were determined by an rluc assay (Promega) RNAs were extracted after incubation with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt. rabbit -globin mRNA obtained from RRL was incubated with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt in RRL. the extracted RNA was subjected to primer extension analysis. nsp1-induced RNA modification in rabbit -globin mRNA was very low. RNA was extracted and subjected to primer extension analysis with a rabbit -globin mRNA-specific primer. the main RNA modification product (site 1) is marked with an asterisk. the 5\u2032-end represents a full-length primer extension product. an RNA size marker (ranging from 10 nt to 100 nt in 10 nt increment) was prepared by using the Decade Marker system (Applied Biosystems) and applied to the same gel. nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavages adjacent to any of the four nucleotides and between different di-nucleotide pairs. nsp1 induced a major endonucleolytic RNA cleavage at nucleotides 18 and 26 of GLA mt 1. nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage showed no apparent nucleotide preference at the RNA cleavage site. incubation of nsp1 with GLA mRNA mt 2 resulted in major and minor cleavages at nucle the predicted RNA secondary structures and the nsp1-induced RNA modification sites at the 5\u2032 UTRs of GLA mutant 1, GLA mRNA (middle) and GLA mutant 2 are boxed. the predicted RNA secondary structures and the corresponding sites of GAL mRNA are boxed. nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in viral mRNAs. the expected length of full-length cDNA product was 120 nt. mRNA 9 was not susceptible to nsp1-mediated endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. mRNA 9 and that of SCoV mRNA 9 were the same. incubation of mRNA 9 with nsp1 did not generate premature primer extension termination signals. nsp1-treated sample showed neither a reduced amount of the full-length cDNA product nor specific premature primer extension termination products. m9LN3 RNA has the following elements: a 5\u2032-end cap structure, the authentic 5\u2032 UTR of SCoV mRNA 9, carrying the common 72 nt-long leader sequence found in all SCoV mRNAs. m9LN lacks the 3\u2032 UTR and the 20 nt poly(A) sequence of m9LN3, while m9N3 lacks the 5\u2032-end leader sequence of m9LN3. m9LN3, m9LN, m9Lrluc3 and m9Lactin3 samples were incubated with nsp1, GST or nsp1-mt. incubation of m9N3 RNA with nsp1 resulted in the generation of two major premature primer extension products and a reduction in the levels of the full-length primer extension product. primer that binds 76 nt downstream of the rluc gene translation initiation codon. primer that binds 100 nt downstream of the -actin gene translation initiation codon. m9Lactin3 RNA template and primer that binds 1 nt downstream of the -actin gene translation initiation codon. nsp1 suppressed translation of viral mRNAs in RRL. nsp1 suppressed translation of viral mRNAs in RRL. nsp1 suppressed translation of viral mRNAs in RRL. we used a reporter assay to show that nsp1 suppressed the translation of the SCoV mRNA 9-like RNA, m9Lrluc3 RNA (Figure 10A) in the HeLa S10 extract (Figure S4B) this data showed that nsp1 did not induce endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in viral mRNAs but was able to suppress the translation of viral mRNAs in vitro. picornavirus type I IRESes include IRESes derived from poliovirus, coxsackie B virus (CVB) and human rhinovirus (HRV) picornavirus type II IRESes include those derived from EMCV and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis (TMEV) testing the susceptibility of these IRESes to nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage would provide RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis by using an rluc probe hybridizing to the rluc ORF and a fluc probe hybridizing to the fluc ORF. RNAs were extracted and subjected to Northern blot analysis by using a non-specific control protein,GST or a mutated form of nsp1-mt with K164A and H165A mutations. the size of the 5\u2032-fragment indicated that nsp1 induced an endonucleolytic cleavage near the 3\u2032-end of TMEV IRES. all RNA transcripts carrying picornavirus type I IRES, including Ren-PV-FF, Ren-CVB-FF and Ren-HRV2-FF, underwent the nsp1-induced RNA cleavage. Ren-TMEV-FF was incubated with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt or without any protein (mock) RNA samples were extracted and analysed using the 5\u2032 rluc probe and 3\u2032 fluc probe. nsp1 did not induce RNA cleavage in Ren-CSFV-FF. nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in RNA transcripts carrying the TMEV IRES or poliovirus IRES. expressed nsp1 exerted template-dependent endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. nsp1 expression reduced the abundance of the full-length RNAs of all of the expressed RNA transcripts. 1-mt in RRL was subjected to primer extension analysis using the 5\u2032-end labeled primer that binds at a site 100 nt downstream of the fluc gene initiation codon. three strong (sites 3, 7 and 11) and several minor primer extension termination signals were detected in the sample that was incubated with nsp1. RNAs were extracted and subjected to primer extension analysis by using the 5\u2032-end 32P labeled primer that binds at 100 nt downstream of the fluc initiation codon region for Ren-EMCV-FF (A) primer extension products and DNA sequence ladders were resolved on 8% polyacrylamide/7M Urea DNA sequencing gels. arrows indicate RNA modification sites and asterisks denote the main ones. primer extension analysis of Ren-PV-FF revealed three major extension termination signals, namely sites 1, 2 and 8, near an AUG (AUG-586) all three major sites 1, 2 and 8, and a minor site 7 were located in close proximity within the computer-predicted secondary structure of poliovirus IRES domain VI. rluc RNA is a capped and polyadenylated mRNA encoding the rluc gene. incubation of rluc RNA with nsp1 in RRL generated several premature primer extension termination products indicative of cleavage near the 5\u2032-end of rluc RNA. the modified rluc RNA became translationally inactive [22]. incubation of ALA mRNA (containing the -actin 5\u2032 UTR) with nsp1 but not GST or nsp1-mt, in RRL resulted in the efficient suppression of rluc protein expression. primer extension analysis of ALA mRNA, which was extracted from RRL after incubation with nsp1, showed two main premature primer extension termination products at nucleotides 29 (site 3) and 39 (site 4). ylated ALA mRNA was incubated with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt in RRL. rluc reporter activities were determined by an rluc assay (Promega) RNAs were extracted after incubation with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt and subjected to primer extension analysis by using a 5\u2032-end labeled primer. RNA was incubated with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt in RRL. a major premature extension termination site and 8 minor products were detected. the most 5\u2032-end minor modification sites 1-3 of -globin mRNA were barely detected in -globin mRNA. nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in ALA mRNA. cap-labeled ALA mRNA was incubated with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt in RRL. nsp1 induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in ALA mRNA. computer-assisted RNA secondary structure analysis implicated a main RNA cleavage and another RNA cleavage occurring at highly proximal positions within stem-loop structures. we examined the nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage sites in a mutated GLA mRNA mt 1. nsp1 induced a major endonucleolytic RNA cleavage at nucleotides p1 with GLA mRNA mt 2 resulted in major and minor cleavages at nucleotides 9 and 16 respectively. nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage of template mRNAs showed no apparent nucleotide preference at the RNA cleavage site. altering the RNA secondary structure affected the pattern of cleavage. mRNAs were purified from SCoV-infected cells and incubated with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt in RRL. the RNAs were then subjected to primer extension analysis by using a 5\u2032-end labeled primer that binds to a region 120 nt from the 5\u2032-end of SCoV mRNA 9. the expected size of the full-length primer extension products of viral mRNA 1 to mRNA 9 was not susceptible to nsp1-mediated endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. mRNAs from infected cells should not undergo nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. nsp1 exerts modification near the 5\u2032-region of SCoV mRNAs. mRNA 9 is resistant to nsp1-mediated endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. we also performed primer extension analysis of mRNA 3 from SCoV-infected cells. nsp1-treated sample showed neither reduced amount of cDNA product nor specific premature primer extension termination products. m9LN lacks the 3\u2032 UTR and the 20 nt poly(A) sequence of m9LN3, while m9N3 lacks the 5\u2032-end leader sequence of m9LN3. in m9Lactin3, the 5\u2032 UTR of actin mRNA is replaced with the 5\u2032 UTR of SCoV mRNA 9; in vitro-synthesized actin mRNA served as a control. similar levels nsp1 induced the endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in actin mRNA. this data showed that the presence of the leader sequence protected the viral mRNAs from the nsp1-induced RNA modification. nsp1 induced an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in both mutants. nsp1 induced an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in both mutants. in vitro-synthesized RNAs were incubated with GST, nsp1 or nsp1-mt. nsp1 suppressed translation of viral mRNAs in RRL. nsp1 suppressed translation of viral mRNAs in a similar radiolabeling assay. nsp1-mediated RNA modification Nsp1 induced an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage within the IRES region of different dicistronic RNAs containing a picornavirus type I or type II IRES [22]. nsp1 induced an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage within the IRES region of different dicistronic RNAs containing a picornavirus type I or type II I the host cell RNase, SMG6, has been shown to play a central role in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay by inducing an endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in ribosome-associated host mRNAs. the no-go mRNA decay pathway detects stalled ribosomes on mRNAs during translation elongation. the yeast dom34/Hbs1 complex is involved in the endonucleolytic cle nsp1-induced RNA cleavage occurs as soon as a complex of nsp1, 40S ribosome, and translation initiation factors that bind to 40S ribosomes. gel electrophoresis of 32P cap-labeled ALA mRNA that had been incubated with nsp1 showed a discrete 29 nt-long RNA fragment that corresponded to nucleotide 29 (site 3). nsp1-induced RNA cleavage occurred between various dinucleotide sequences. nsp1 induced RNA cleavage within the 5\u2032 UTR of capped mRNAs and within the picornavirus type I and type II IRES elements. eIF4G and eIF4A recruit the 43S ribosome complex to viral mRNAs. eIF4G and eIF4A are required for nsp1-induced RNA cleavage. eIF4A and eIF4G are required for nsp1-induced RNA cleavage. the third model proposes binding of nsp1 to the 40S ribosome may induce a substantial conformational change in 40S ribosomes such that HCV, CSFV or CrPV IRESes may not be in close proximity to the RNase activity induced by the formation of the nsp1-40S ribosome complex. nsp1-40S complex loads onto SCoV mRNAs in such a way that the putative RNase that carries out the RNA cleavage cannot interact with SCoV mRNAs. nsp1 induced an RNA cleavage at the very 5\u2032-end of SCoV mRNA 9 mt 1, carrying an extra G residue at the 5\u2032-end of the transcripts, and SCoV mRNA 9 mt 2, carrying the leader sequence of SCoV mRNAs could recruit a host protein(s) to protect the viral mRNAs from RNA cleavage. translation of SCoV mRNAs and a reporter mRNA carrying the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of SCoV mRNA was suppressed in the presence of nsp1. the nature of the nsp1-mediated RNA modification is endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. this conclusion leads to the question as to the identity of the enzyme responsible for the endonucleolytic RNA cleavage. nsp1 has no similarities in its primary amino acid sequence or protein structure with any known host proteins, including RNases. nsp1-induced RNA cleavage occurs as soon as a complex of nsp1, 40S ribosome, and translation initiation factors that bind to 40S ribosomes. nsp1-induced RNA cleavage occurs as soon as a complex of nsp1, 40S ribosome, and eIF1A loads onto mRNA templates. d ALA mRNA that had been incubated with nsp1 showed a discrete 29 nt 32P cap-labeled RNA fragment. primer extension analysis showed a major premature termination site that corresponded to nucleotide 29 (site 3). nsp1-induced RNA cleavage occurred at site 3 in ALA mRNA. nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage exhibited little nucleotide preference. nsp1 induced RNA cleavage within the 5\u2032 UTR of capped mRNAs. IRESes of HCV, CSFV, and CrPV were resistant to nsp1-induced RNA cleavage. only the 40S and 60S ribosomes, but not any translation initiation factors, are needed for translation initiation for the CrPV IRES [30] due to differences in the mechanism of translation initiation between capped cellular mRNAs and mRNAs with IRESes. one model proposes that eIF4A and eIF4G are required for nsp1-induced RNA cleavage. nsp1-induced endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in infected cells strongly suggest that SCoV mRNAs are resistant to nsp1-induced RNA cleavage in infected cells. in vitro-synthesized SCoV-like mRNAs containing the SCoV leader sequence were resistant to nsp1-induced RNA cleavage, while SCoV-like mRNA lacking the leader sequence the 5\u2032-terminal region of the SCoV leader sequence may play a role in preventing the putative RNase from associating with the viral mRNAs. the binding of nsp1 to 40S ribosomes may induce structural alterations of the 40S ribosome. preventing the interaction between eIF4E and eIF4G that inhibits cap-dependent translation also blocked coronavirus replication. nsp1 inactivates translation functions of 40S ribosomes in infected cells. abundance of 40S ribosomes most likely exceeds that of nsp1 in infected cells. nsp1-40S ribosomes may be dissociated easily from nsp1-40S complex. human -actin mRNA, rluc gene and a 50-nt-long poly(A) tail resulted in pALA-SV40 encoding ALA mRNA. similar method was used except that the 5\u2032 UTR of human -actin mRNA in pALA-SV40 was replaced by the 5\u2032 UTR of rabbit -globin mRNA. the RT-PCR product of full-length SCoV mRNA 9 was cloned into pcDNA3.1 myc/His (Invitrogen), generating pSMART. the plasmid, pSm9Lactin3, encoding human -actin mRNA carrying the 5\u2032 UTR of SCoV mRNA 9 was generated by replacing the 5\u2032 UTR of human -actin mRNA in pSA with the 5 proximal sequence of the in vitro synthesized RNA was identical to that of authentic SCoV mRNA 9 mt 1 RNA. the amplicon, purified on an agarose gel, served as a template for the synthesis of uncapped SCoV mRNA 9 using the MEGAscript T7 kit (Applied Biosystems) similar procedures were used for the generation of m9LN and m9LrLuc3 RNAs, except that the PCR m9LN RNA was incubated with 1 g GST protein, nsp1 protein or nsp1-mt protein. molar ratio of nsp1 to mRNA was approximately 2001. samples were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 10 min. '-AGCAATTGTTCCAGGAACCAGGG, 100 nt downstream of fluc translation initiation codon, incubation at 55\u00b0C for 1 h and subsequent incubation at room temperature for 10 min. m9LrLuc3, 5\u2032- TTTTTCTGAATCATAATAATAATTAA-3\u2032, 100 nt downstream of rluc translation initiation codon, incubation at 42\u00b0C for 1 h and subsequent incubation at room temperature for nsp1-induced cleavage product of cap-labeled ALA mRNA was resolved in 8% polyacrylamide/7M Urea DNA sequencing gels. Cap labeling was performed by incubation of 30 g of uncapped RNA with vaccinia virus capping enzyme in the presence of -32P GTP. the RNA ladder contained a set of cap-labeled RNA molecular weight markers of 150, 100, 90, 80, 70, 60, 50, 40, 30, 20 and 10 nt in length. an equal volume of 2x proteinase K digestion buffer was added to the prepared RNA ladder to adjust the salt concentration to a level similar to that of RNA samples extracted from RRL. plasmids pRL-TMEV-FL, pRL-PV IRES-FL, pRL-CVB3 IRES-FL, pRL-HRV2 IRES-FL and pRL-CSFV IRES-FL were constructed by replacing the HCV IRES region of plasmid pRL-HL with that of following viruses and the nucleotide sequences of the viral genome. -actin mRNA and a 20-nt-long poly(A) tail were cloned into the vector pSMART, yielding pSA. the plasmid, pSm9Lactin3, was generated by replacing the 5\u2032 UTR of human -actin mRNA in pSA with the 5\u2032 UTR of SCoV mRNA 9. RNA, SCoV mRNA 9 mt 1 RNA, and SCoV mRNA 9 mt 2 RNA were generated using forward primers with the SARS 3\u2032 UTR primer. the amplicon, purified on an agarose gel, served as a template for the synthesis of uncapped SCoV mRNA 9 using the MEGAscript T7 kit (Applied Biosystems) similar procedures were used for the generation of m9LN and m9L the molar ratio of nsp1 to mRNA was approximately 2001. samples were incubated at 30\u00b0C for 10 min. luc assays were performed by adding 5 l translation product. 6 nt downstream of AUG translation initiation codon of fluc gene, incubation at 55\u00b0C for 1 h and subsequent incubation at room temperature for 10 min. SCoV mRNA 9, m9LN3, and m9LN, 5\u2032-GGGTCCACCAAATGTAATGC-3\u2032, 44 nt downstream of 3a gene translation initiation codon, incubation at 50\u00b0C for 1 h and subsequent incubation at room temperature for Cap labeling was performed by incubation of 30 g of uncapped RNA with vaccinia virus capping enzyme in the presence of -32P GTP (3,000 Ci/mmole, MP) the sample was incubated with proteinase K, and RNA was extracted by phenol/chloroform. an equal volume of 2x proteinase K digestion buffer was added to the prepared Decade Marker RNA ladder to adjust the salt concentration to a level similar to that of RNA samples extracted from RRL. the RNA samples were analyzed on 10% polyacrylamide/7M Urea DNA sequencing gels. plasmids included in RNA expression plasmid were TMEV IRES (A), poliovirus IRES (B), HCV IRES (C) or CSFV IRES (D) after 24 hr, total RNA was extracted from the cells by using Trizol reagent.
