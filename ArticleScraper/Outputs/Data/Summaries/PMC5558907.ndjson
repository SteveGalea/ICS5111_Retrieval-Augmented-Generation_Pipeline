{"summary": "PRF is stimulated by a stable structure formed by the viral mRNA downstream from a \u201cslippery sequence\u201d where the frameshift actually occurs. however, the details of how PRF is induced and its level regulated by frameshift signals remain controversial. Pseudoknots, formed when nucleotides within a hairpin loop base pair with complementary nucleotides outside of that loop, are the most common PRF stimulatory structure. the conformational plasticity of the pseudoknot under tension has been suggested to play an important role. a pseudoknot-like triplex composed of interactions between the upper stem and the 3\u2032 arm of the lower stem forms upon lower-stem unwinding by the ribosome. an alternative model has been proposed, however, whereby a pseudoknot-like triplex composed of interactions between the upper stem and the 3\u2032 arm of the lower stem forms upon lower-stem unwinding. previous work on the mechanical unfolding of the HIV-1 stimulatory hairpin using optical tweezers found that the upper stem was mechanically stable but not the lower stem. Neither the heterogeneity of the dynamics nor the energy landscape was investigated, however. a single discrete unfolding transition was typically observed in the range 14\u201321 pN (122 FECs) the contour length change upon unfolding, Lc, was consistent with unfolding only the upper stem. the lower stem unfolding occurred at very low force, as found previously. the average unfolding force from 3280 FECs provided the simplest measure of the mechanical stability. p(F) was exactly the shape expected for a two-state system with a single barrier (Dudko et al. 2006) and was well-fit by Equation 2. the distribution of refolding forces for HIV-1 upper stem alone FECs (black) is poorly fit by Equation 2 (red), a consequence of heterogeneous refolding that is more complicated than the single-barrier two-state behavior observed for unfolding. refolding is more complex than a single-barrier, two-state system. fat tails or multiple peaks in the force distribution have been shown to be a consequence of heterogeneity in the folding behavior. 5% of curves showed evidence of partially folded intermediate states. folding intermediates showing individual unfolding (red) and refolding (black) FECs with WLC fits to the folded branches and the intermediate state (blue) the intermediate state appears as a transient excursion out of the unfolded state that returns to the unfolded state before the folded structure is attained. most FECs show length changes and unfolding forces corresponding to those expected for unfolding the upper stem alone (black) the same Lc (within error) was found as for the upper stem, 13 1 nm from 2713 FECs. the same Lc (within error) was found as for the upper stem. intermediates were detected in a small subset of refolding FECs. the 5\u2032FL sequence must form the upper-stem hairpin structure almost all the time. a larger Lc than for the upper stem is only possible if nucleotides are part of the upper-stem hairpin. a structure consistent with this pseudoknot-like triplex can indeed form when the 5\u2032 strand of the lower stem is removed, mimicking the situation when this strand is sequestered under the ribosome footprint just before the frameshift occurs. a key question is what property of this hairpin accounts for its unusual ability to trigger 1 PRF efficiently. the HIV-1 stimulatory hairpin has folding dynamics that are unusually complex for a simple stem\u2013loop, which typically unfold and refold as two-state systems. the refolding force distributions are consistent with the presence of both static and dynamic heterogeneity, but it has not previously been suggested to play a functional role. the observed distributions provide evidence for both types of heterogeneity. multiple peaks may be discerned, but there is also a low-force tail. however, we are unable to quantify the heterogeneity by fitting the distributions. a model of the energy landscape for native folding under tension shows a shallow well that could support an intermediate state. the heterogeneity observed in the refolding of the HIV stimulatory hairpin evokes a key feature of pseudoknot folding. this connection may help explain how this hairpin can act as a stimulatory structure in 1 PRF. some studies of hairpin-stimulated frameshifting have led to the proposal that hairpins stimulate PRF by acting as a simple roadblock. however, robust quantitative correlations remain elusive. the handles were annealed with the RNA transcript, then incubated with 600 and 820 nm diameter polystyrene beads labeled with avidin DN and anti-digoxigenin. the handles were placed in measuring buffer (50 mM MOPS, pH 7.0, 130 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl2, 50 U/mL Superase\u2022In [Ambion] and oxygen scavenging system) change in RNA contour length was found by fitting the two branches of the FECs on either side of a transition. contour length change expected from the NMR structure of the HIV-1 frameshift hairpin was calculated using Lc = nnt Lcnt \u2013 dT. ing forces was analyzed using the kinetic theory of Dudko et al.
