{"summary": "in china, the hepatitis B virus surface antigen (HBsAg) carrier rate accounts for 9.8 percent of the population, and one third of the worldwide carrier. infection by the virus results in a series of clinical symptoms ranging from minor flu-like symptoms to acute, fulminant or chronic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, and liver carcinoma. POMs have been widely researched in recent years. they have been proven to be active against a wide range of viruses. the mechanism of antiviral action may occur through the prevention of viral adsorption and penetration. inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) methods with more sensitively and selectively were first applied to determine the concentration of W in plasma, urine, feces, bile and organ samples. findings would be useful to evaluate the potential medicinal application of Compound 1, and to perfect and complete the pharmacokinetics of POMs. rats were housed in a specific pathogen-free facility with controlled temperature of 241\u00b0C, relative humidity of 555%, and a 12-h light/dark cycle. all animals had free access to water and a standard rat diet. free access to food was resumed 4 h after dosing. the blood volume withdrawn at each time point was replaced with an equal volume of saline, administered orally, to compensate for fluid loss. blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and plasma was frozen at 20\u00b0C until analysis. the bile samples were collected during 0\u20131, 1\u20132, 2\u20134, 4\u20138, 8\u201312, 12\u201324 and 24\u201348 h by bile duct cannulation. the bile volume was measured, and samples were frozen at 20\u00b0C until analysis. nebulizer gas flow rate was 0.89 l/min and the auxiliary gas flow rate was 1.20 l/min. number of sweeps per reading was 3, the dwell time was 50 s, the sample flush time was 35 s, the sweep time was 20 s and the wash time was 45 s. urine, bile, postdialysis serum and buffer samples were aliquots into 0.1 mL, treated in the same way as plasma samples. assay Method Concentrations of Compound 1 were determined by atomic spectrometry. polyoxometalate concentrations were estimated directly from measured tungsten concentrations. quantitative method did not differentiate between parent compound and potential degradation or biotransformation products. feces to render solutions for testing with 5, 10 and 20 ng/mL were prepared, detected, and calculated by comparing the concentrations detected with the ones known in advance. pharmacokinetic analysis was performed using Kinetic 5.0 computer software (thermo scientific Inc., USA) results were expressed as the meanstandard derivation (SD) all other analytical grade chemicals were obtained from Chemical Co., China. the study was approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Jilin University. all efforts were made to minimize suffering through the use of anesthesia, analgesia, and post-injury care. the blood volume withdrawn at each time point was replaced with an equal volume of saline, administered orally, to compensate for fluid loss. blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and plasma was frozen at 20\u00b0C until analysis. rats were placed in metabolism cages during the experiment. urine and feces were collected during 0\u20131 h, 1\u20132, 2\u20134, 4\u20138, 8\u201312, 12\u201324, 24\u201348 and 60\u201372 h. bile samples were collected during 0\u20131, 1\u20132, 2\u20134, 4\u20138, 8\u201312, 12\u201324, 24\u201348 and 60\u201372 h. aliquots of 0.1 mL plasma was transferred into a test tube, and 3 mL concentrated HNO3 was added. the sample uptake rate was 1.0 ml/min, the plasma gas flow rate was 15 l/min, nebulizer gas flow rate was 0.89 l/min and the auxiliary gas flow rate was 1.20 l/min. each test tube was laid on a hot plate, heated and refluxed at 60\u00b0C for 6 h. aliquots into 0.1 g and dipped in 1 mL concentrated H2SO4 in test tubes. samples were analyzed directly by ICP-MS. the same set of the QC samples were used for assessment of precision, accuracy, and recovery. the precision and accuracy of the method were evaluated using quality control (QC) samples in six replicates at three concentrations of 5, 10, and 20 ng/ml on 3 consecutive days. blood samples of 0.2 mL were collected into heparinized tubes at 0, 0.083, 0.25, 1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 6.0, 12.0, 24.0, 48.0, 72.0 and 96.0 h via retrobulbar veniplex after the dose. blood samples were immediately centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 5 min, and plasma was frozen at 20\u00b0C until analysis. the whole brain, heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, uterus, testis, ovary, epididymis, stomach, intestine, pancreas, thymus, fat, and skeletal muscle were rapidly dissected and harvested. all tissues and organs were weighed on an analytical balance and frozen at 20\u00b0C until analysis. serum (1 ml) was dialyzed against 10 mL of 0.1 mol/L isotonic sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in a shaking water bath at 37\u00b0C for 48 h. binding data were corrected for fluid shifts that occurred during dialysis. the urine, bile, postdialysis serum and buffer samples were aliquots into 0.1 g. each test tube was laid on a hot plate, heated and refluxed at 60\u00b0C for 6 h. 3 mL concentrated HNO3was added at 120\u00b0C for 12 h until thorough dissolution. HF at a concentration of 10 g/mL were prepared by further dilution of the stock solution with an appropriate amount of ultra pure water. the working solutions were freshly prepared every week and stored at 4\u00b0C. results were expressed as the meanstandard derivation (SD) data subjected to a one-way analysis of variance followed by the least significant difference (LSD) post-hoc test. differences were considered statistically significant at P0.05. both intra- and inter-day precisions and accuracies are within acceptable limits (i.e. less than 15% for RSD% and RE%) for low QC, medium QC and high QC samples (8). 2.920 10 10.2230.161 2.234 1.290 1.575 20 20.0210.394 0.104 0.875 1.970 Muscle 5 5.2270.061 5.538 1.171 1.171 1.163 10 10.3040.102 3.042 0.990 0.992 20 20.2340.211 1.172 0.852 1.041 Urine 5 5.2730.169 5.461 2.358 3.205 10 9.9580.154 0.420 1.157 1.550 20 19.7890.203 1.0 the plasma concentration-time profiles of Compound 1 after intravenous administration were characterized in rats and illustrated in Figure 1. the main pharmacokinetic parameters of Compound 1 after intravenous administration were characterized in rats and illustrated in Figure 1. 053.529 CL mL/h 15.341.695 Vd mL 679.7114.7 t1/2, half-life; Ke: elimination rate constant; Tmax: time of peak concentration; AUC0\u201396: area under the curve up to 96 h; AUC0\u2013, area under the total concentration-time curve; MRT, mean residence time; CL, systemic clearance; Vd, steady-state volume of distribution. 0.753 2.1670.753 Cmax g/mL 11.138.370 30.8514.25* 49.299.939* AUC0\u201396 g\u2022h/mL 150.987.15 373.9112.7* 1216402.2* AUC0\u2013 g h/mL 165.194.98 410.1128.5* 1316449.7* MRT H 36.454.495 35.425.940 37.574.676 CL mL/h 86 accumulative excretion rate of urine, feces and biles after orally administered Compound 1 is shown in Figure 4. results indicated that the main excretion mechanism of Compound 1 was through feces, which accounted for about 30% of the drug tested. urine accounted for approximately 0.28% and bile accounted for about 0.42%. ICP-MS uses a special interface technique to incorporate the inductively coupled plasma with the quadrupole mass spectrum. the inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES) provides improved sensitivity and selectivity and is very suitable for pharmacokinetic studies. both intra- and inter-day precisions and accuracies are within acceptable limits. both intra- and inter-day precisions and accuracies are within acceptable limits. the linear ranges were 0.05100 ng/mL. 71 0.300 0.634 0.860 Liver 5 5.6130.283 12.263 5.198 5.047 10 9.9010.314 0.986 3.447 3.169 20 18.2640.533 8.681 1.260 2.916 Fat 5 5.2340.153 4.674 2.307 2.920 10 10.2230.161 2.234 1.290 1.575 20 20.0210.394 0.104 0.875 1.970 Muscle 5 5.2270.061 5.538 1.171 1.163 10 Figure 1 shows the plasma concentration-time profiles of Compound 1 after intravenous administration at 180 mg/kg Compound 1 in Wistar rats (mean S.D., n = 6). the main pharmacokinetic parameters of Compound 1 after intravenous administration were characterized in rats. pharmacokinetic profiles of Compound 1 were investigated in Wistar rats after a single oral dose of 45, 180 or 720 mg/kg of Compound 1. no significant differences were observed in the pharmacokinetic parameters among the three different groups. ke 1/h 0.0250.002 0.0250.003 0.0280.003 Tmax H 2.0000.632 1.8330.753 2.1670.753 Cmax g/mL 11.138.370 30.8514.25* 49.299.939* AUC0\u201396 g\u2022h/mL 150.987.15 373.9112.7* 1216402.2*. the highest deposition was found in the kidney, followed by the stomach, intestine and liver. the major organ for deposition of Compound 1 was the kidney, followed by the stomach, intestine and liver. the pharmacokinetics study of Compound 1 in rats is critical to fighting viral atntigens. the pharmacokinetics profiles of Compound 1 in rats were determined by quantitative ICP-MS method. t1/2, ke, CL, MRT and Vd are linear correlative with oral doses (P0.01). tmax ranges from 0.1 h to 3 h and the half-life of Compound 1 is between 20 h to 30 h. a good prospect of Compound 1 as a long-time-use drug for chronic hepatitis. content of Compound 1 in kidney and liver was as high as 10\u201370 times the content in the other tissues. the high content in liver is also in favor of the treatment of chronic hepatitis. the clearance from tissues is rather quick; the content in tissues is less than 10% of the peak content at 96 h. preclinical pharmacokinetics study shows that Compound 1 appears to have these above properties. results could provide reference for further study of metabolism of compound 1."}
