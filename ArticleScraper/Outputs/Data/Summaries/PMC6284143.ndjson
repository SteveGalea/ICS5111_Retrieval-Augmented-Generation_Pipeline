{"summary": "study aims to describe the development of a real-time autonomous dashboard for the ED and to evaluate perspectives of clinical staff on its usability. results The first version of the ED dashboard was successfully launched in 2013, and it has undergone 3 major revisions since then. multiple studies have suggested the use of system engineering and science to improve ED performance, streamline the process, and improve the throughput [11-13] a strategic approach to identify process delays and supply-demand mismatch using traditional hospital information systems is not feasible. a dashboard that fits the changing situations in the ED in the real time must have the characteristics of both quality and clinical dashboards [17]. study aimed to describe the development of a real-time organizational dashboard for the ED. it was undertaken at an ED with an annual visit volume of 79,000 patients in a tertiary teaching hospital. the hospital has about 2000 inpatient beds. the dashboard was designed to be like a traditional whiteboard for the ED. it should be mounted on a wall and be visible to providers from about 2-5 m away. it should be in a static mode, without flipping the screen, so that providers would not waste any time to find the desired information. patient-level alert All beds and chairs were symbolized to stand for a patient to provide patient-specific information to ED clinicians. additional patient-level information was included to provide a real-time alert to providers through encoded colors and symbols. the main objective of this concept was to provide a patient-level alert to providers through encoded colors and symbols. our entire platform was developed and deployed on 2 Windows 2008 servers. the servers queried measurements from the electronic medical records and picture archiving and communication system servers. a Windows communication foundation was used as a visualization tool. study was carried out at an ED with an annual visit volume of 79,000 patients in a tertiary teaching hospital. the hospital has about 2000 inpatient beds. no ED-specific dashboard system was ever used in this hospital. we did not include a writing and communication function from the dashboard. it should be integrated with the clinical workflow. an unfavorable clinical workflow often changes after implementing health information technology. additional patient-level information was included to provide a real-time alert to ED staff through encoded colors and symbols. the dashboard would show summary statistics regarding ED performance in the real time. a real-time summary depends mostly on subjective feeling of individual providers. a Windows communication foundation was used as a visualization tool. the ED dashboard adopted such changes and evolved through the process. the ED dashboard adopted such changes and evolved through the process. the dashboard was designed to be like a traditional whiteboard

to find the desired information. the dashboard should be integrated with the clinical workflow. an unfavorable clinical workflow often changes after implementing health information technology [21-23] but the Happy Emergency Room Team worried that the dashboard could be a source of botheration. a real-time summary depends mostly on subjective feeling of individual providers. with summary data, providers would be able to reschedule clinical processes. for example, a nurse could direct a patient to the X-ray if there is a long queue for a co-ordered computed tomography. a co-ordered computed tomography was proposed for the dashboard. the model consisted of 3 factors, among which the throughput factors were mostly demonstrated with the dashboard. the dashboard adopted such changes and evolved through the process. participants responded to 20 questions on a 5-point Likert scale after completing a consent form. the last 10 items of the questionnaire were derived from the system usability scale (SUS) to investigate the usability of the dashboard. the last 10 items were derived from the situation awareness index (SART) the results were interpreted using an adjective rating scale [29]. the SAI score was calculated using an adjective rating scale. a major change in version 4 is the improvement of patient-specific information. the circle next to the patient indicates the mapping of the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale score from 1 to 5. in the physician group, 17 were males and 8 were females. the physician and nurse groups had scores of 67.5 and 67.69 points respectively. acceptability of the dashboard was \u201cmarginally high\u201d and the adjective rating was \u201cOK-to-Good\u201d [29]. 67.69 (11.0) 67.60 (11.4) Situation Awareness Index The overall SAI score was 3.87 points. the score of the physician group (3.95) was higher than that of the nurse group (3.80). the top 5 rated items were \u201cconcentration support\u201d (4.15), \u201ccomplexity representation\u201d (4.02 points), \u201cvariability representation\u201d (3.96 points), \u201cinformation quality provided\u201d (3.94 points), and \u201cfamiliarity of dashboard\u201d (3.94 points). a semicircle-shaped indicator in the upper central area represents the complexity of the ED and presents the expected mean length of stay of a current patient in the ED. a semicircle-shaped indicator in the upper central area represents the complexity of the ED and presents the expected mean length of stay of a current patient in the ED. a major change in version 4 is the improvement of patient-specific information. the circle next to the patient indicates the mapping of the Korean Triage and Acuity Scale score from 1 to 5 presented from red to green. in 2015, the ED of the study site underwent a Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak. a respiratory isolation area was established and operated. a major change in version 4 is the improvement of patient-specific information. the score of the ED dashboard system was 67.6 points (Table 2). acceptability of the dashboard was \u201cmarginally high\u201d and the adjective rating was \u201cOK-to-Good\u201d [29]. the participants used it very frequently. 2.52 (1.1) 2.70 (1.1) 2.62 (1.1) System usability scale score 67.50 (12.0) 67.69 (11.0) 67.60 (11.4) Situation awareness index The overall SAI score was 3.87 points. the score of the physician group (3.95) was higher than that of the nurse group (3.80). the quantity of information provided by the dashboard is appropriate for performing ED tasks. 3.84 (0.9) 3.67 (0.8) 3.75 (0.8) Information quality provided Q19. the quality of information provided by the dashboard is appropriate for performing ED tasks. the physician and nurse groups had scores of 67.5 and 67.69 points. the results indicate that the participants used it very frequently. they also felt that this system was easy to learn and use. the score of the physician group (3.95) was higher than that of the nurse group (3.80). the top 5 rated items were \u201cconcentration support\u201d (4.15), \u201ccomplexity representation\u201d (4.02 points), \u201cvariability representation\u201d (3.96 points), and \u201cfamiliarity of dashboard\u201d (3.94 points). the score for \u201cdivision of attention\u201d was 2.25 points (Table 3). ED staff responded that the dashboard presented the situation in the ED effectively. the quality of the information provided by the dashboard was rated high. the ED dashboard affects the workflow of various medical personnel in the ED in a variety of ways, from simple information delivery to clinical decision-making support. a major difference between the introduction of an electronic dashboard and the mental workload of ED staff is controversial. the measures used for the dashboard are not universally agreed upon. they have mainly been used in a highly crowded EDs of a teaching hospital. the measures were not compared with the national standard, which requires further research. the quality of the information provided by the dashboard was rated high. however, the quantity of information was rated relatively low. there is a need for a systematic investigation to establish the information that ED staff seek. a major difference between our system and other electronic boards is that our dashboard does not allow manual or direct input of patient-specific information. we have fully synchronized our dashboard with the legacy system such that physicians\u2019 and nurses\u2019 additional inputs are not required to use the dashboard. this is a single-center case study with its unique HIS. that continuous maintenance is important because the dashboard should reflect the situation of the ED."}
