{"summary": "FIPV is an enveloped virus with a nonsegmented, positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome. it is grouped as feline coronavirus (FCoV), under the family Coronaviridae. the relationship between these two biotypes remains unclear. antiviral drugs such as ribavirin, interferons, and immunosuppressive drugs have been used as treatments for infected cats. however, those treatments were ineffective. there is still significant unmet medical need to develop effective treatments and prophylactics for FIPV infection. the results were recorded after 72 hours. the virus tissue culture infective dose 50 (TCID50) was calculated using Reed and Muench's method.

EMSA analysis illustrated binding of circular TFO1, 3, 4, and 5 to the target regions as evidenced by upward band shift. binding of each circular TFO except circular TFO2 to its respective target forms a complex that migrate slower than unbound TFO. the stronger the binding is, the more stable the triplex structure forms. the data analyzed by one-way ANOVA, Tukey post hoc test showed significant high viral RNA genome copy number of 4.03 1014 for virus inoculated cells. the viral RNA copies of circular TFO1, TFO3, TFO4, and unrelated circular TFO7 RNAs transfected cells also showed high viral RNA copy numbers which did not show significant differences to the infected cells. the experimental conditions were identical to that of the previous experiment except for TFO1 concentrations of 25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 500 nM. no significant reduction in viral RNA genome copies using the concentration of 25 nM TFO1. the target regions were 5\u2032 untranslated region (5\u2032 UTR), Open Reading Frames (ORFs) 1a and 1b, and 3\u2032 untranslated region (3\u2032 UTR) both ends of the duplex TFOs were ligated with a linker sequence or clamps (C-C) to construct circular TFO RNA. EMSA analysis illustrated the binding of circular TFO1, 3, 4, and 5 to its respective target regions as evidenced by upward band shift. binding of each circular TFO except circular TFO2 to its respective target forms a complex that migrate slower than unbound TFO. the results showed viral RNA genome copy numbers of 3.65 109, 3.22 1014, 5.04 109, 5.01 109, 4.41 109, and 3.96 1014 in cells treated with TFO1, TFO2, TFO3, TFO4, and TFO5 treatments. the viral RNA copies of circular TFO1, TFO3, TFO4, and unrelated circular TFO7 RNAs transfected cells also showed high viral RNA copy numbers. the experimental conditions were identical to that of the previous experiment, except for TFO1 concentrations of 25 nM, 50 nM, 100 nM, and 500 nM. the other concentrations caused significant reductions in copy numbers compared to the virus-infected cells. development of antiviral therapies against FIPV using siRNA [25] and viral protease inhibitors [26] has been tested as potential new treatments against FIPV infection. ligated circular TFOs were evaluated using PAGE analysis. no antiviral properties were detected from the linear TFOs and unrelated circular TFO7 RNA. however, no antiviral properties were detected from the linear TFOs. binding of the circular TFO to the target region was confirmed by nanoITC analysis. the circular TFOs were designed in such way that the presence of hydrogen bonding donors and acceptors in the purines is able to form two hydrogen bonds. the pyrimidine bases can only form one additional hydrogen bond with incoming third bases. however, there are various factors that may limit the activity of TFOs in cells like intracellular degradation of the TFO and limited accessibility of the TFO to the target sites. the inability of TFO2 to show antiviral effect due to failure in the formation of functional tertiary structure of the triplex formation cannot be ruled out. in vitro antiviral study which showed no antiviral property for unrelated TFO (TFO7) and also inability of circular TFO1 and TFO5 to inhibit influenza A virus H1N1 infected cells confirm the specificity of the TFOs' activity. 1N1 replication showed no significant reduction in viral RNA genome copy numbers between the TFO RNA transfected cells and untransfected cells (p 0.05). data are average of 3 independent tests (mean SE) Conflict of interests The authors have declared that no conflict of interests exists."}
