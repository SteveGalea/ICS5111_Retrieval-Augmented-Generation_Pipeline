{"summary": "the circumpolar region can be defined as a region that extends north of 60\u00b0 north latitude, borders the Arctic Ocean. climate in the Arctic varies geographically from severe cold in arid uninhabited regions to temperate forests bordering coastal agrarian regions. the populations of these countries comprise varying proportions of European and indigenous ancestry. in remote regions of the North American Arctic, Greenland, and the northern Russian Federation, many residents live in small, isolated communities. public health and acute-care systems are often marginal, sometimes poorly supported, and in some cases nonexistent. the Arctic is well known as a vast source of natural resources such as fish, forests, oil, gas, and metal ores. in remote Alaskan villages, lack of ready access to laboratory confirmation of bacterial pathogens may contribute to overuse of antimicrobial agents. presence of antimicrobial drug\u2013resistant bacterial clones has led to an increase in infections with multidrug-resistant S. pneumoniae (24,25), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (13), and clarthromycin- and metronidazole-resistant H. pylori (14). surveillance for invasive disease caused by S. pneumoniae, established in the us Arctic in 1986, showed that Alaska Natives had the highest reported average overall rate for invasive pneumococcal disease in the world. the rate was 450 cases/100,000 versus 129 cases/100,000 among non-Native children. population has reduced the proportion of invasive disease caused by isolates resistant to penicillin, erythromycin, and cotrimoxazole (29) population-based surveillance of diseases of concern, including invasive bacterial diseases, is conducted by public health agencies in Canada, Greenland, Iceland, Norway, Finland, and Sweden. ICS capitalizes on existing national infectious disease surveillance systems and existing long-standing circumpolar collaborative relationships forged through the Arctic Council. in 1999, a pilot surveillance system was established to monitor reported cases of invasive pneumococcal disease from 23 clinical laboratories in Alaska and 14 clinical laboratories in the northern Canadian Arctic above 60\u00b0 north latitude. a pilot surveillance system was established to monitor reported cases of invasive pneumococcal disease from 23 clinical laboratories in Alaska and 14 clinical laboratories in the northern Canadian Arctic. an ICS quality control exchange program was instituted in 1999 among the 3 reference laboratories (AIP, NCS, LSPQ) for serotyping and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of S. pneumoniae (31) the program was extended to SSI in 2004. several initiatives are now aimed at improving cooperation in infectious disease prevention and control between countries of northwestern Europe and adjacent regions of the Russian Federation. ICS data were used to identify an outbreak of S. pneumoniae serotype 1 invasive disease that occurred among young adults in 2 northern regions of Canada. the reemergence of invasive disease caused by Hib in the us in 1996 emphasized the need for continued surveillance to monitor vaccine impact. the importance of infections caused by nonvaccine serotypes has increased with the decline in Hib disease. an outbreak of Vibrio parahemolyticus-related gastroenteritis was reported in July 2004 among cruise ship passengers that consumed raw oysters in the Prince William Sound area of Alaska. the water temperature of the oyster farm had increased 0.21\u00b0C per year since 1997; 2004 was the first summer on record that the mean water temperature exceeded 15\u00b0C. higher ambient temperatures in the Arctic may result in an increase in other temperature-sensitive foodborne diseases. tuberculosis working group would enhance efforts to reduce rates of disease in these regions by sharing knowledge, methods, and surveillance data. more than half of the circumpolar region is contained within the Russian Federation."}
