{"summary": "in china, approximately 12,772 types of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) resources are used, including 1,574 (12.32%) kinds of animals. the Chinese Pharmacopoeia recognizes 616 kinds of medicinal materials and cut crude drugs. the populations of many animals commonly used in TCM have declined. conservationists and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and conservationists have instituted many of these conservation mechanisms. the success of many of these mechanisms remains uncertain. consumer preferences are known to play an important role in consumer buying behaviors in the wildlife trade [3,15,17\u201318] existing research suggests that people may prefer wild-sourced products because they believe that wild materials are more potent than farm-raised ones [3,16] the ability of farmed animal-based products, such as bear bile, to reduce demand is at best limited [22] and this might be thought to increase the demand for substitutes [23], the ongoing and pervasive influence of ancient tenets of TCM may mean consumers are in fact willing to pay a higher price for wild products rather than buy cheaper farmed the study design and study reporting were conducted in accordance with the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative research (COREQ) framework. the checklist was completed and is listed in S2 Appendix. no repeat interviews were conducted in this survey. questionnaire design was modified based on the results of a pilot study on 11 postgraduate students at the Institute of Zoology, Chinese Academy of Sciences. the questionnaire consisted of 5 parts: cover letter, completion instructions, questions, answers, and coding. an objective and neutral manner was used to describe and present the questions to avoid prejudicing the respondents\u2019 answers. a seven-point Likert scale was employed as a data collection instrument for attitude questions. stated preference experiments embodying three different scenarios to elicit consumer preferences. a choice experiment approach was also used to collect data. the respondent was asked to choose their preferred TAM from either \u201cwild\u201d, \u201cfarmed\u201d, \u201cother animal materials\u201d as a substitute, \u201csynthetic\u201d or \u201cwhatever\u201d material under the following sets of conditions. both the curative effects and prices of the TAMs were identical; (ii) the TAMs had identical curative effects but prices that decreased in the order presented above. a total of 194 data coders coded the data using a coding manual. the data were further checked in the database for manual typing errors. a logistic regression model was used to estimate the relationship between demographic variables and the use of TAMs. ail-Haq (AMH) copula were built to demonstrate how the distribution characteristics and substitutability of TAMs changed. the following formula was used for the AMH copula: C ( u, v ;) = u v / [ 1 ( 1 u ) ( 1 v ). a stratified survey design was chosen to randomly select neighborhoods and households from a sample frame. no repeat interviews were conducted in this survey. interviews were randomly checked by supervisors on the spot. the questionnaire consisted of 5 parts: cover letter, completion instructions, questions, answers, and coding [27] an objective and neutral manner was used to describe and present the questions to avoid prejudicing the respondents\u2019 answers. rt scale was used as a data collection instrument for attitudes questions. stated preference experiments embodying three different scenarios to elicit consumer preferences. a choice experiment approach was also used to collect data. the respondent was asked to choose their preferred TAM from either \u201cwild\u201d, \u201cfarmed\u201d, \u201cother animal materials\u201d as a substitute, \u201cplant material\u201d as a substitute, \u201csynthetic\u201d or \u201cwhatever\u201d material. both the curative effects and prices of the TAMs were identical; (ii) the TAMs had identical curative effects but prices that decreased in the order presented above. a total of 194 data coders coded the data. the data were further checked in the database for manual typing errors. Scenario 1 The respondent was required to purchase 9 TCM products. the proportion of respondents who believed that a certain TAM must be protected was used as an indicator of the \u201cconservation consciousness\u201d of that respondent. the level of attention was measured using a seven-point Likert scale [19]. the questionnaire was checked after each interview in the field. correlation and regression analyses were conducted to evaluate how having heard of or used TAMs and PCMs affected respondents\u2019 perceptions of TCM. curvilinear, binary logistic and nonlinear regression models were established to estimate the relationship between the frequencies of choosing different medicinal materials. the frequencies of choosing wild, farmed, and substitute sources and the degree of conservation consciousness were estimated using probability distribution models. data that were not normally distributed or were skewed were transformed by taking the squared root of the data if they were concentrated near 0 or taking the arcsine of percentage data. results logistic regression of demographic information and use of TAMs A total of 1,100 questionnaires were issued. gender ratio was

paid less attention to the composition of TAMs (2.6610.030) and non-TAMs (2.6220.031) (p0.05) the selection frequency of \"wild animal\" was the lowest (p0.01). no significant difference was observed between choice of \"farmed animal\" and \"wild plant\" substitutes. the selection frequency of \"wild\" was negatively correlated with that of \"farmed\" selection frequencies of \u201cwild\u201d (y)

contributions of the first two principal components were as. arrows FE, SE and WA were highly correlated with the first axis. correlation coefficients were 0.6032, 0.8790, and -0.8112, respectively.

Correct No 90.89%, Correct 61.84%, Total Correct 84.89%, Cutoff 0.5. respondents in our study demonstrated minimal understanding of the function and composition of TCMs and PCMs. research suggests that consumers may balance tradeoff between preference for wild sources. more farmed or alternative materials were selected by consumers. the degree of substitutability of varying animal materials changed following certain patterns. previous research has shown that consumers are willing to pay high prices to buy wild-sourced TAMs because they believe those products are more potent. however, curative effects had an even more powerful, positive impact on consumer choice, which overrode price-consciousness for some respondents.
