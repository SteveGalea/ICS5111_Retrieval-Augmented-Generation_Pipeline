RNA was extracted from primary human granulocytes followed by reverse transcription into cDNA. in 293 cells as well as in HeLa cells only the grb14 gene was transcribed. grb14 is recruited to CEACAM3 upon infection with CEACAM3-binding bacteria. 293 cells were co-transfected with expression plasmids encoding for mKate-tagged wild type CEACAM3 (CEACAM3-mKate) together with GFP-tagged full-length Grb14. 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding CEACAM3-GFP or GFP alone. the lysates were probed with GST-fusion proteins of isolated SH2 domains of Grb7, Grb10, Grb14, PI3KR3-N, Slp76, or the full-length Grb14. the SH2 domain of Grb14 interacts directly with phosphorylated CEACAM3. 293 cells were transfected with an empty control vector (GFP) or GFP-tagged CEACAM3 together or not with v-Src. lysates from C were used in an immunoprecipitation (IP) with pAb against mKate. peptide spot membranes harboring synthetic 15-mer peptides surrounding tyrosine residues of the CEACAM3 cytoplasmic domain were probed with GST or GST-Grb14-SH2. the peptides were synthesized as individual spots on a cellulose membrane (22) each peptide was produced in the phosphorylated form (pY) and the unphosphorylated form (Y) the membrane was incubated with recombinant GST-Grb14-SH2 domain or GST alone. mCherry FRET pair is particularly suited for this type of analysis. in contrast, CFP shows double exponential fluorescence decay even in the absence of the YFP acceptor impeding calculation of fluorescence lifetimes and FRET efficiencies (24). as a standard reference, we first analyzed the EGFP lifetime of CEACAM3-EGFP transfected 293 cells in the absence of a FRET acceptor. pixel-by-pixel basis and lifetime values are color-coded. images were recorded before and after photobleaching of the acceptor mCherry. analysis of time resolved fluorescence data reveals biexponential decay behavior. FLIM analyzed infected cells expressing CEACAM3-EGFP together with mCherry-Slp76-SH2 or expressing CEACAM3 with a deletion of the cytoplasmic domain (CEACAM3) together with mCherry-Grb14-SH2 respectively. results reveal an intimate, direct association of the SH2 domain of Grb14 with tyrosine-phosphorylated CEACAM3 in intact cells. CEACAM3-expressing HeLa cells were stably transduced with lentiviral particles lacking a shRNA sequence (control virus) knock-down of Grb14 in the shGrb14 cell population was nearly complete and reduced the amount of endogenous Grb14 to about 10%. la-CEACAM3 cells transduced with empty lentiviral particles (empty vector) or with lentiviral particles encoding a Grb14-directed shRNA (shRNA-Grb14) expression of CEACAM3 was detected with monoclonal anti-CEACAM antibody (middle panel) after stripping of membrane, equal protein content of all samples was verified using an anti-tubulin antibody (lower panel). expression of CEACAM3 and expression of different Grb14 constructs was verified by Western blotting. cells were infected with OpaCEA-expressing gonococci. phagocytosis was quantified by flow cytometry. 1 h after infection, samples were fixed and extracellular gonococci were stained with a Neisseriae-specific antibody and a Cy5-labeled secondary antibody. a 50% reduction in intracellular gonococci was detected in cells co-expressing CEACAM3 and wild type Grb14. 293 cells expressing the indicated constructs were infected with PacificBlue-labeled gonococci (total Ngo OpaCEA) at an MOI of 30 for 1 h. extracellular bacteria were stained with polyclonal antibody against gonococci and a Cy5-labeled secondary antibody (extracellular Ngo OpaCEA) arrowheads indicate extracellular bacteria, small arrows point to internalized bacteria. the SH2-mediated association of Grb14 with the receptor has an inhibitory effect on bacterial internalization and restricts CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis. our investigation took advantage of the miniaturized and highly parallel determination of protein-protein interactions afforded by protein domain microarrays (14) grb14 is expressed in most tissues, including myeloid cells. it has been found to associate with several activated growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases such as the EGF receptor, FGF receptor, PDGF receptor, and insulin receptor (IR) (27). RNAi-mediated knock-down of Grb14 provided a loss-of-function scenario. only expression of full-length Grb14 inhibited CEACAM3-mediated phagocytosis of N. gonorrhoeae. yrosine residue has been characterized for the macrophage receptor Dectin-1. pY230 initiates opsonin-independent phagocytosis of dextran-exposing particles including yeast. inhibition of CEACAM3-associated PTKs by the Grb14 BPS domain could limit CEACAM3-downstream signaling. fluorescence microscopy approaches such as FRET determination are required to clearly resolve the spatial and temporal pattern of protein binding to the hemITAM of CEACAM3. this is in contrast to intensity-based FRET-methods where quantification of interaction partners is highly sophisticated and requires the availability of appropriate controls. murine granulocytes, which could be isolated from wild type and Grb14/ mice, do not express CEACAM3. previous studies using pharmacological inhibitors or cell-permeable function-blocking peptides have provided convincing evidence that CEACAM3-expressing 293 cells are relevant surrogates for primary granulocytes."}
