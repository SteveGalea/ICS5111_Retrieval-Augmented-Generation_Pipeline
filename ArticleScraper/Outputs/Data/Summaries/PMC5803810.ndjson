{"summary": "TECHNICAL VS POLITICAL DELAYS If global surveillance was the main source of delay, there would be a significant lag between an outbreak\u2019s index case and local health officials\u2019 action that leads to laboratory diagnosis. if surveillance is not a main source of delay, slow mobilization following outbreak detection may be a culprit. the H1N1 outbreak began March 15, 2009, was detected March 18, 2009, and was declared a PHEIC April 25, 2009. for the Zika outbreak, the main concern was microcephaly rather than Zika virus infections. we consider this outbreak to have begun October 22, 2015, when the rise in microcephaly cases was first identified. despite growing evidence of the outbreak\u2019s uncontrolled spread, a PHEIC was not declared until august 8, 2014. most recently, there was delayed global political mobilization for the Zika outbreak, despite Brazil\u2019s declaration of a national emergency on November 11, 2015. elicited fastest response after only 3 countries, whereas Zika\u2019s slower response came after 21 countries were affected More people at risk Mostly future babies at risk Close contacts and caregivers at highest risk Not supported Ebola, which risked an intermediate-sized population. outbreak of microcephaly related to Zika virus contradicts this hypothesis. only three countries had H1N1 infections when that outbreak was declared a PHEIC. a third hypothesis is that the number of people at risk predicts mobilization. airborne diseases, like H1N1, can spread more broadly, put more people at risk, be more difficult to contain, instill greater fear, and require more stringent precautions than do diseases like Ebola that spread only through contact and droplets. if airborne diseases are most difficult to contain, they would more easily trigger an emergency. evidence from all three case studies supports this hypothesis. for H1N1, a PHEIC was declared 10 days after the first US citizen had a documented infection, on April 15, 2009.17. Ebola was declared a PHEIC only six days after infected health care providers arrived for the first time in the united states on august 2, 2014. more research should be conducted to better understand why other recent outbreaks, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, were not declared PHEICs. more research should also be conducted to better understand the role that scientific uncertainty may play in delaying political responses to outbreaks."}
