{"summary": "dengue fever is a severe flu-like illness that affects the infants, children, adolescents, and adults. infection with dengue virus can cause three clinical syndromes with undifferentiated febrile illness or viral syndrome, classic dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DSS) a tourniquet test was performed and around 20-22 petechiae/2.5 cm2 were observed. the patient was then subjected to a series of hematological and biochemical investigations. DISCUSSION DHF is caused by one of four closely related, but antigenically distinct, virus serotypes (DEN 1-4) of the genus Flavivirus. most commonly affected sites are the conjunctival and sclera margins, soft palate, lips and the tongue. hemorrhagic plaques are seen in most cases of idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura. a prodromal phase of intraoral koplik spots prior to the occurrence of the cutaneous rash is characteristic of measles. acute retroviral syndrome presents with generalized morbilliform exanthema that spares palms and soles, lasts for 4-5 days, and is associated with fever, myalgia, and lymphadenopathy. two clinical observations plus one laboratory finding are sufficient to establish a diagnosis of DHF."}
