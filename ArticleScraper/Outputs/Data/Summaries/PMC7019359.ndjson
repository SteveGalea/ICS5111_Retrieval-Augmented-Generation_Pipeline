{"summary": "ICV seropositivity has been found to be as high as 90% by 7\u201310 years of age, suggesting most people are exposed to influenza C virus at least once during childhood [7,8] a related novel influenza D virus (IDV), was discovered in swine in 2011 and has been detected in other mammals. ICV hemagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) glycoprotein encoded on segment 4 effectively fulfills the roles of both HA and NA. hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) mediate attachment, entry, and escape. ICV is an enveloped, negative-sense RNA virus that belongs to the Orthomyxoviridae family. it has a 7-segmented genome that encodes 9 viral proteins. some IAV strains express other proteins PB1-F2 or PA-X from alternate reading frames. the internal structure of ICV is dominated by ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) that are composed of ribonucleoproteins. segment 5 codes for nucleoprotein (NP) and segments 1\u20133 code for the polymerase (P) subunits basic (PB)2, PB1 and P3 respectively. segment 7 encodes Non-structural protein 1 (NS1), which inhibits host immune responses. studies of ICV infection measuring hemagglutinin inhibition (HAI) antibody titers have been key in demonstrating widespread nature of ICV circulation and infection. in the last decade, highly sensitive nucleic acid detection methods have been developed for the detection of ICV. the highest level of seropositivity was found among young adults (20\u201330 years), while low ICV HAI titers and decreased seropositivity in those 65\u201385 years may suggest waning ICV immunity in the elderly [7] a french study of 301 subjects included sera from 237 subjects in 4 age groups: 1 to 2 years (36%), 2 to 5 years (47.2%). s collected over seven years found that nearly all were 6 years old, with the highest rates of infection in children 1\u20132 years old. most of these studies found higher rates of ICV infection in younger children. several studies have reported ICV as a cause of radiographic pneumonia in children. winter-spring seasonality in ICV detection remained consistent, though Anton et al. report year-round detection of ICV in Spain with highest numbers observed in the summer. substantial antigenic and genetic diversity exists among ICV isolates; there are six genetic lineages representing six antigenic groups of HEF. 14 patients had available clinical information; - = not reported ICV infection is more commonly associated with hospitalization and lower respiratory disease in young children. Intensive Care Unit admission among infants with prematurity and congenital heart disease is reported in 58\u201380% of cases. iency, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, cystic fibrosis, and congenital heart disease have also been described. iency, acute lymphoblastic leukemia, cystic fibrosis, and congenital heart disease have also been described. co-infection may be associated with increased severity of disease. the low number of patients hospitalized with ICV and co-infection with another respiratory pathogen may minimize the role of ICV in respiratory infection leading to hospitalization. few studies have been performed and uncertainty remains. recent epidemiologic studies have taken advantage of improved cell culture techniques and RT-PCR as a means of detecting ICV. studies reporting ICV outbreaks and seroprevalence suggest that ICV infection was widespread among children in the u.s. and england. increased seropositivity increased with age, with 64% seropositivity. spanish study including 191 subjects 1 to 80 years of age living showed seroprevalence of 68%. ICV infection is widespread globally with most infections occurring in young children. a number of studies have focused on pediatric populations. the peak of ICV was in may during biennial epidemics in even-numbered years [60], according to a multi-year study. the peak of ICV was in france in winter-spring of 2005, while little ICV was detected in the two following seasons. the most common symptoms associated with ICV infection are fever, rhinorrhea, and cough; however, the virus has been associated with pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and bronchitis [1,12,63,77,92,94,95,101,102,103,104]. Symptoms of gastroenteritis in patients infected with influenza C virus are frequently reported. ICV-associated hospitalization occurs most often among children 3 years of age. cases of Intensive Care Unit admission among infants with prematurity and congenital heart disease have been described. the presence of influenza or other community-acquired viruses can compromise physical and immunologic barriers. the presence of influenza or other community-acquired viruses can compromise physical and immunologic barriers."}
