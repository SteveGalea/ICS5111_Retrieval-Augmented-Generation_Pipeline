{"summary": "the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the branched-chain DNA (bDNA) test have been widely adopted. the bDNA test is a method for detecting DNA or RNA using branched-chain DNA. it has the advantage of being quantifiable, but has a lower detection sensitivity than the PCR method. current investigations on sensing with THz metamaterials have been restricted to micro-sized microorganisms (/100) because their size corresponds to the typical metamaterial gap dimension. detection of the bacteriophage viruses PRD1 (60 nm) and MS2 (30 nm) range from /5,000 to /10,000 of the incident THz waves. THz-TDS measurements We used a THz-TDS system to record transmission of THz electromagnetic waves through the metamaterial sensor. a linearly polarized THz pulse was produced by illuminating a photoconductive antenna with a mode-locked femtosecond laser ( = 800 nm) the THz beam was focused on an area of 1 mm2 of the metamaterial surface, under ambient conditions. to measure the dielectric constant of a virus layer, we used a different metamaterial device fabricated on a Si substrate (resistivity > 10,000 cm and thickness 550 m), employing a conventional photolithography technique. a linearly polarized THz pulse was produced by illuminating a photoconductive antenna with a mode-locked femtosecond laser ( = 800 nm) we measured the change in the THz spectrum transmitted through the micro- and nano-gap metamaterials after deposition of the PRD1 and MS2 viruses. the resonant frequency is determined by geometrical factors such as the gap width and sidearm length, and also by the substrate refractive index (nsub) [11,14] THz transmission spectra are shown for the two types of virus films. these are for a thickness of 40 m, which is considerably larger than the saturation thickness of 10 m. a dielectric constant of 3.48 (PRD1) and 3.83 (MS2) is observed from the resonant frequency shift. the films were prepared by stacking virus layers on a cellulose membrane. the dielectric constant at THz frequencies is close to unity, making the films virtually freestanding. the data at 0.8 THz show excellent agreement with the values obtained by metamaterial sensing techniques. f occurs with the deposition of viruses with surface number density of 4/m2 for PRD1. r is the dielectric constant of the individual virus, air is the dielectric constant of air, and eff ( = neff2) is the effective dielectric constant in the gap area without viruses. sensitivity is higher for objects with aspherical shapes and with more detailed structure. the enhanced sensitivity for MS2 presents an interesting issue that requires future investigations to fully understand the underlying mechanisms. the sensitivity of the metamaterials in terms of the number of virus particles increases from 6 GHzm2/particle (w = 3 m) to 80 GHzm2/particle (w = 200 nm), which is an increase of 13 times. the sensitivity reaches up to 40 GHz/particle in terms of the number of viruses located within the gap area. we will be able to develop highly sensitive virus sensors enabling single virus detection. the sensitivity can be enhanced by optimizing the geometry of the pattern and substrate configuration [11], and selective detection of viruses in water environments can also be achieved by immobilizing their antibody to the gap structure [10]. our work will contribute in the development of effective sensors for rapid, accurate, and in situ detection of viruses in diverse environments. the authors declare that there are no conflicts of interest related to this article."}
