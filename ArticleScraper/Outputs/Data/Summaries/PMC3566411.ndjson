{"summary": "RABV has been the best characterized and most utilized circuit tracing viruses to date. RABV can travel across only one synapse, allowing for a straightforward definition of monosynaptic connections. RABV can be used as a polysynaptic tracer that spreads across many synapses. if the virus is a monosynaptic or polysynaptic tracer is determined by the method of delivery of the G gene. advantages of VSV are that it is well-characterized, is relatively simple in comparison to PRV. it is also being developed as a vaccine vector, often using a G of another virus as the immunogen. all VSVs contain four essential proteins: N, P, M, and L. some viruses encode a G gene in their genome, which allows them to spread polysynaptically. some viruses encode a transgene in the first position, while others carry an additional transgene in the G position. rVSV could be taken up as a retrograde polysynaptic transsynaptic tracer. rVSV can encode a variety of transgenes. rVSV can encode a variety of transgenes. physiology of cells infected with rVSV encoding RABV-G. we tested a replication-competent rVSV encoding GFP. by 12 hpi, labeling was sufficiently bright to image fine morphological details. rat hippocampal slices were infected with a replication-incompetent rVSV that expresses mCherry. infected cells were infected with a replication-incompetent rVSV that expresses mCherry. infected cells were infected with a replication-incompetent rVSV. viral labeling in the brain was restricted to primary and secondary projection areas, even at 7 dpi. viral labeling in the brain was restricted to primary and secondary projection areas, even at 7 dpi. rVSV(RABV-G) exhibits polysynaptic retrograde spread in vivo. rVSV(RABV-G) injected into V1 (black needle) should yield infected cells in the labeled areas shown in green, including RGCs in the retina. rVSV(RABV-G) can trace circuits into the CNS from a peripheral site. if retrograde uptake and transport can occur, trigeminal ganglion neurons that project to the dura (green) should be labeled by this virus. infected neuronal cell bodies were not located on the dura, (M) but instead were observed in the trigeminal ganglion. scale bars: (B,I,J) = 1 mm, (L) = 100 m, (C\u2013G,M) = 50 m. these data show that rVSV(RABV-G) can spread in a retrograde direction from the injection site, but do not address whether the virus can spread exclusively in the retrograde direction rVSV(RABV-G) is a neuronal circuit thought to be involved in migraine headaches. neurons have axons, but not canonical dendrites, and send projections into the spinal cord and brainstem. only way trigeminal neurons could become labeled from viral application is through retrograde uptake of the virus. cells labeled by rVSVG(RABV-G) were observed in the CP, GP, substantia nigra (SN), thalamus, and layers 3 and 5 of the cortex. rVSV(RABV-G) spread from the CP recapitulates the connectivity of known basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuits. rVSV(RABV-G) was injected into the CP. the time course of labeling was monitored for 5 days. sections from animals at 1 dpi show labeling consistent with the initial infection. the nucleus basalis was labeled by 2 dpi following rVSV-G injection into the CP. the virus appeared to travel transsynaptically at the rate of roughly 1 synapse per day. labeling remained well-restricted to the expected corticostriatal circuits at 5 dpi. if different fluorophores are used in different viruses, then the viruses can be co-injected into the same site and their transmission can be traced independently. this is most straightforward if there are no cells at the injection site that are initially infected. insets show high magnifications of thalamic neurons in (E) and (F) labeled by the two viruses. rVSV(VSV-G) that expressed Venus was injected into M1. rVSV(RABV-G) that expressed mCherry was injected into SN. rVSV(VSV-G) was observed to infect neurons in the cortex, CP, and downstream nuclei. the rVSV(RABV-G) was not observed to infect neurons in the CP, but rather in the thalamus and nucleus basalis. the initial co-infection rate is dependent upon the dose of the initial inocula. rVSV can trace monosynaptically connected circuits in the retrograde direction. this was achieved in vivo by first infecting with an adeno-associated virus. this was followed 3 weeks later by infection with a RABV with an EnvA/RABV-G chimeric glycoprotein. six-week-old mice from this cross were injected in the CP with two AAV vectors. one expressing a Cre-conditional TVA-mCherry fusion protein and another RABV-G. two weeks later, the mice were injected in the same coordinates with rVSVG with the EnvA/RABV-G chimeric glycoprotein. the injection of rVSV into the CP (black needle) should result in infection of TVA-expressing neurons in the CP. from these starter cells, monosynaptic spread could occur only to directly connected inputs such as those in the cortex and thalamus (green) mice injected with these viruses were sacrificed 5 days after rVSV infection. all rVSV vectors drove robust fluorophore expression 1 or 2 days post-infection (hpi) by 12 hpi, labeling was sufficiently bright to image fine morphological details, such as dendritic spines. physiology of cells infected with replication-incompetent rVSV encoding RABV-G. slices were cut 12 hpi and recordings were taken over the subsequent 6 h. examples of spike trains driven by 100, 200, and 400 pA square current pulses lasting 1 s for infected and uninfected neurons. horizontal bars denote mean with standard error of the mean. average fluorescence intensity of the infected cells was measured every hour. by 4 hpi at 37\u00b0C, red fluorescence was clearly visible. similar results were obtained with a virus encoding GFP in the first genomic position rather than mCherry. rVSV(RABV-G) injected into V1 (black needle) should yield infected cells in the labeled areas shown in green. rVSV(RABV-G) exhibits polysynaptic retrograde spread in vivo. rVSV(RABV-G) was injected into V1 (yellow arrowhead) both the brain and retina examined 7 dpi. higher magnifications of labeled cells from a V1 injection are shown in panels. rVSV(RABV-G) was applied to the intact dura. if retrograde uptake and transport can occur, trigeminal ganglion neurons should be labeled. if retrograde uptake and transport can occur, trigeminal ganglion neurons that project to the dura should become labeled. rVSV(RABV-G) has been a powerful application of both RABV and PRV. we examined the innervation of the dura surface by neurons of the trigeminal ganglion. these neurons have axons, but not canonical dendrites, and send projections into the spinal cord and brainstem. the only way trigeminal neurons could become labeled from viral application to the dura is through retrograde uptake of the virus injections of rVSV(RABV-G) and rVSV(VSV-G) were made into the CP. cells labeled by replication-incompetent rVSVG(RABV-G) were observed in the CP, GP, substantia nigra (SN), thalamus, and layers 3 and 5 of the cortex. animals were infected with G viruses to determine which areas were labeled by direct uptake of the virions. rVSV(RABV-G) was injected into the CP (red arrows), and the time course of labeling was monitored for 5 days. the nucleus basalis was examined after infection of the CP with replication-competent rVSV(RABV-G) the virus appeared to travel transsynaptically at the rate of roughly 1 synapse per day. labeling remained well-restricted to the expected corticostriatal circuits at 5 dpi. glial cells can be infected and were observed near the injection site. polysynaptic tracers can be combined in vivo. they can be used in parallel or in tandem to trace circuitry to and from a single or multiple sites of injection. if different fluorophores are used in different viruses, then the viruses can be co-injected into the same site. the retrograde virus rVSV(RABV-G) labeled M1 as well as areas projecting to the cortex, including the thalamus. insets show high magnifications of thalamic neurons in (E) and (F) labeled by each virus. a rVSV(VSV-G) expressing Venus and a rVSV(RABV-G) expressing mCherry were injected individually or co-injected into the motor cortex. brains were examined 3 dpi. the pattern of labeling from the co-injected brains was equivalent to the patterns observed when each virus was injected individually. rVSV(VSV-G) was injected into the motor cortex, rVSV(RABV-G) was injected into the substantia nigra pars reticulara (SNr) cells were singly labeled either with Venus [rVSV(VSV-G)] or with mCherry [rVSV(RABV-G) six-week-old mice from this cross were injected in the CP with two AAV vectors. one expressing a Cre-conditional TVA-mCherry fusion protein and another expressing a floxed RABV-G. two weeks later, the mice were injected in the same coordinates with rVSVG with the EnvA/RABV-G chimeric glycoprotein on the virion surface. rVSVG(A/RG), a G-deleted virus that only infects TVA-expressing neurons, was injected into the same region. the injection of rVSV into the CP should result in infection of TVA-expressing neurons in the CP. rVSV(RABV-G) is a retrograde transsynaptic tracer in the CNS. it can be modified to encode the RABV-G protein in the viral genome. if the virus has the G gene deleted from its genome, it behaves as a monosynaptic tracer. more than one transgene can be encoded in the viral genome without the need of a 2A or IRES element. the use of the first position of the genome enhances the expression level of the transgene inserted at that location. this leads to rational predictions of expression levels so that one can choose the position of insertion of a transgene. the same cell with multiple rVSVs could still be labeled by different viruses. the observed results could be due to a preferential labeling by the anterograde transsynaptic virus of indirect pathway MSNs in this experiment. a further possibility is that too little virus was used to observe co-labeling of a given region. replication-competent and incompetent forms of VSV are in use under Biosafety Level 3 containment. differences in pathogenicity between VSV and RABV are likely due to the ability of RABV to evade the innate immune system, particularly interferon. rVSV(RABV-G) is a retrograde transsynaptic tracer in the CNS. no injected animals showed any evidence of morbidity or mortality. the main drawback to using VSV is its rapid cellular toxicity. VSV can be modified to encode the RABV-G protein in the viral genome. if the virus has the G gene deleted from its genome and RABV-G is provided in trans, it behaves as a monosynaptic tracer. the retrograde transmission specificity among neurons had not been shown to be a property of the G protein itself. the size of the viral capsid is apparently not rigid, allowing for the inclusion of genomes that are substantially larger than the native genome. the size of the viral capsid is apparently not rigid, allowing for the inclusion of genomes that are substantially larger than the native genome, unlike the rigid capacity for some other viral vectors. rVSV appears to attenuate with increasing numbers of synapses crossed. this is likely due to viral attenuation when VSV-G is replaced with RABV-G. incompetent forms of VSV are in use under Biosafety Level 2 containment. infection with replication-competent RABV is almost always fatal to humans and in mice when infected intracerebrally. differences in pathogenicity between VSV and RABV are likely due to the ability of RABV to evade the innate immune system. VSV is much quicker to enact its gene expression program than is RABV. cells suffer the toxic effects more quickly than after RABV infection. rVSV vectors can be used to study connectivity of neuronal circuitry. rVSV clones were cloned from the rVSVG backbone. mCherry, Kusabira orange, Venus, and RABV-G were cloned into the fifth (G) position using the MluI and NotI restriction sites. genes for fluorescent proteins were obtained from Clontech. plasmids were collected for 4 days at 24 h intervals. all plasmids are available from Addgene (http://www.addgene.org/). 100 nL of 1 107 ffu/mL rVSV(RABV-G) or rVSVG(VSV-G) was injected. mice harvested 2 dpi for CP injections. 100 nL of 3 107 ffu/mL rVSV(VSV-G) was injected into M1, and 100 nL of 3 108 ffu/mL rVSV(RABV-G) into the SNr. a lower titer of rVSV(RABV-G) was used, as rVSV(RABV-G) is attenuated. all mouse work was conducted in biosafety rotoxin, 10 M 2,3-Dioxo-6-nitro-1,2,3,4-tetrahydrobenzo[f]quinoxaline-7-sulfonamide and 10 M 3-((R)-2-Carboxypiperazin-4-yl)-propyl-1-phosphonic acid were present in the ACSF to block GABAA/C, AMPA, and NMDA receptor-mediated transmission. the time course of viral gene expression experiments were carried out in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures prepared from postnatal day 5\u20137 Sprague-Dawley rats. rVSV clones were cloned from the rVSVG backbone (Chandran et al., 2005) concentrated viral stocks were applied in a dilution series to 100% confluent BSR cells and plates were examined at 12 hpi. for G viruses, 293T cells were transfected with PEI. twenty-four hours post-infection, the cells were infected at 0.01. primary motor cortex: A/P +1.34 from bregma, L/M 1.7, D/V 1 from pial surface LGN: A/P 2.46 from bregma, L/M 2, D/V 2.75 Superior Colliculus: A/P 3.88 from bregma, L/M 0.5, D/V 1 CP: A/P 3.88 from bregma, L/M 1.5, D/V 4.25 For multi-color a mater, 1 L of 3 1010 ffu/mL rVSV(RABV-G) was applied to the surface of the dura. the virus was allowed to absorb, and the surface was covered in bone wax, and the wound sutured. a lower titer of rVSV(RABV-G) was used, as rVSV(RABV-G) is attenuated. slices were transferred to artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 127 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 1.25 NaH2PO4, 2.5 KCl, 1 MgCl2, 2 CaCl2, and 25 glucose. slices were then transferred to artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) after an incubation period of 30\u201340 min at 34\u00b0C, stored at room temperature. data was filtered at 5 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz. imaging and physiology data were acquired and analyzed."}
