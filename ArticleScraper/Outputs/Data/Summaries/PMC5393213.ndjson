{"summary": "a congenic mouse was developed by replacing mouse Dpp4 exons 10\u201312 with the corresponding human DPP4 codons (hDPP4-KI) the targeted founders were expanded by breeding and offspring characterized by genotyping for the presence of human DPP4 sequence. macrophage immunostaining were commonly seen (arrows, Middle), as was weak staining of alveolar epithelia (Inset) the pleural surface (arrows) had multifocal DPP4 immunostaining. results are representative of findings from four hDPP4 KI mice. hDPP4 KI mice infected with P30 MERSMA lost significant weight and most died. clone 6.1.2 causes lethal lung disease in male and female hDPP4 KI mice. clone 6.1.2 is a triple plaque-purified virus. KI mice infected with clone 6.1.2 exhibited dose-dependent fatal disease. an inoculum of 5 103 pfu was lethal in both sexes. RT-PCR performed on indicated tissues from clone 6.1.2-infected mice at 1 and 3 d.p.i. Limit of detection for qRT-PCR is 100 copies. n = 3 cells were infected with indicated MERS-CoV at MOI 0.1. clone 6.1.2-infected lungs had significantly reduced cellular infiltrates. we localized virus N protein in infected lung tissue at 3 d.p.i. clone 6.1.2-infected mice had much more widespread N-protein staining of alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia. clone 6.1.2-infected lung exhibited edema (black asterisks, Bottom Middle, 400x), scattered cell death/debris (inset and red arrow, Bottom Right), and/or hyaline membranes (black arrows, 600x) clone 6.1.2 lungs significantly reduced cellular infiltrate and increased hyaline membranes (P = 0.01 and P = 0.003, respectively, Mann\u2013Whitney). we measured mRNA abundance for several antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in lung tissue from KI mice infected with clone 6.1.2, at 1 and 3 d.p.i. using qRT-PCR. the induction of several host defense genes was similar for both viruses. peripheral blood from clone 6.1.2-infected mice also had morphologic evidence of monocyte activation, a reduced erythrocyte density, and reduced polychromatophils (immature RBCs) these results provide further evidence of a systemic illness in clone 6.1.2-infected animals. more mononuclear cells were detected in EMC/Vero compared with clone 6.1.2-infected or uninfected mice. more IMMs and fewer lymphocytes were detected in the lungs of animals infected with clone 6.1.2 compared with EMC/Vero virus. histograms and scatterplots show levels of activation markers, CD69 and CD80 on lung-derived IMMs (C), and neutrophils (D). data were derived from two independent experiments with three to six mice per group per experiment. each sequenced genome had between 12 and 21 nonsynonymous differences compared with the published EMC/2012 isolate (42). clone 6.1.2 expressed full-length 3, 4a, and 4b gene products. no evidence for differences in virulence when isolates containing ORF3/4a/4b or lacking their expression were compared. each isolate had mutations in the S protein, including the passage 21 isolate, which was not fully virulent. vesicular stomatitis virus-based MERS S pseudoviruses (46) were transduced into murine lung epithelial type I cells (47) expressing hDPP4 (48) these viruses were highly sensitive to the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d, which inactivates endosomal cathepsins, but relatively resistant to the serine protease inhibitor camostat, which inactivates cell-surface transmembrane recombinant MERS-CoV and the MA1.0 and MA2.0 recombinants were inoculated into 12- to 18-wk male hDPP4-KI mice to assess disease outcomes and virus titers. after a 104 pfu inoculum, the recombinant viruses caused a mild transient weight loss with no mortality. recombinant viruses caused minimal weight loss and no mortality in young 6- to 8-wk hDPP4-KI mice. mutations arising in the S protein partially contribute to increased virulence observed in MERSMA-infected mice. mutations arising in the S protein partially contribute to the increased virulence observed in human cells. a congenic mouse was developed by replacing mouse Dpp4 exons 10\u201312 with the corresponding human DPP4 codons (hDPP4-KI) the targeted founders were expanded by breeding and offspring characterized by genotyping. hDPP4 KI mice infected with 104 to 106 pfu MERS-CoV. a 104 pfu virus inoculum caused progressive weight loss and 50% mortality. human DPP4 KI mice infected with P30 MERSMA lost significant weight and most died. results summarize two replicate experiments, n = 10 (EMC/Vero), n = 11 (MERSMA), mixed male and female mice. KI mice infected with clone 6.1.2 showed dose-dependent fatal disease. we compared outcomes of male and female mice to several inocula. an inoculum of 5 103 pfu was lethal in both sexes. ORF1a quantitative RT-PCR performed on indicated tissues from EMC/Vero and MERSMA clone 6.1.2-infected mice at 1 and 3 d.p.i. Limit of detection (LOD) for qRT-PCR assay is 100 copies. clone 6.1.2-infected lungs had significantly reduced cellular infiltrates. we localized virus N protein in infected lung tissue at 3 d.p.i. clone 6.1.2-infected mice had much more widespread N-protein staining of alveolar macrophages and alveolar epithelia. clone 6.1.2-infected lung had perivascular to interstitial mononuclear infiltrates. clone 6.1.2-infected lung exhibited edema (black asterisks, Bottom Middle, 400x), scattered cell death/debris (inset and red arrow, Bottom Right), and/or hyaline membranes (black arrows, 600x) we measured mRNA abundance for several antiviral and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) in lung tissue from KI mice infected with clone 6.1.2, at 1 and 3 d.p.i. using qRT-PCR. the induction of several host defense genes was similar for both viruses. peripheral blood from clone 6.1.2-infected mice also had morphologic evidence of monocyte activation, a reduced erythrocyte density, and reduced polychromatophils (immature RBCs) these results provide further evidence of a systemic illness in clone 6.1.2-infected animals. clone 6.1.2-infected mice were infected with clone 6.1.2-infected mice. infitrates were composed mostly of lymphocytes in the former group. more IMMs and fewer lymphocytes were detected in the lungs of animals. bar graphs show levels of activation markers, CD69 and CD80 on lung-derived IMMs (C), and neutrophils (D). data were derived from two independent experiments with three to six mice per group per experiment. each sequenced MERSMA genome had between 12 and 21 nonsynonymous differences compared with the published EMC/2012 isolate (42). clones encoded virus deleted in ORFs 3a, 3b and or 4, but clone 6.1.2 expressed full-length 3, 4a, and 4b gene products. no evidence for differences in virulence when isolates containing ORF3/4a/4b or lacking their expression were compared. each isolate had mutations in the S protein, including the passage 21 isolate, which was not fully virulent. vesicular stomatitis virus-based MERS S pseudoviruses (46) were transduced into murine lung epithelial type I cells (47) expressing hDPP4 (48) these viruses were highly sensitive to the cysteine protease inhibitor E64d, which inactivates endosomal cathepsins, but relatively resistant to the serine protease inhibitor camostat, which inactivates cell-surface transmembrane recombinant MERS-CoV and the MA1.0 and MA2.0 recombinants were inoculated into 12- to 18-wk male hDPP4-KI mice to assess disease outcomes and virus titers. the recombinant viruses caused a mild transient weight loss with no mortality. these recombinant viruses caused minimal weight loss and no mortality in young 6- to 8-wk hDPP4-KI mice. mutations arising in the S protein partially contribute to increased virulence observed in MERSMA-infected mice. mutations arising in the S protein partially contribute to increased virulence observed in human cells. hDPP4-KI mice supported modest replication of EMC/Vero MERS-CoV in the lung. the infection featured diffuse alveolar damage, dysregulated innate immune responses, and the presence of activated inflammatory monocyte\u2013macrophages and neutrophils. marmosets develop lung disease and associated mortality in response to large inoculum (30), but others report minimal disease in marmosets (58). phenotypes in other mammals studied are mild and do not result in severe MERS-like disease. ERSMA reported here showed enhanced virus replication, significant lung pathology, and mortality with an inoculum as low as 5 102 pfu. mutations arose following 30 in vivo serial passages, including those in the S protein. this innovation yielded a virulent mouse-adapted MERS-CoV with mutations distinct from those identified here. 4 KI mice caused a predominantly parenchymal lung disease associated with diffuse alveolar damage, a common pathologic feature of ARDS. dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immunopathology and increase morbidity and mortality (65\u201368) MERSMA clone 6.1.2 and the recombinant MA1.0 and MA2.0 viruses all exhibited S-protein mutations associated with \u201cearly entry\u201d (46), a characteristic of coronaviruses that preferentially use cell-surface transmembrane proteases, such as TMPRSS2 (72, 73), for their virus\u2013cell membrane fusion activation and resultant cell entry. hDPP4 KI mice may be useful in studies of disease pathogenesis, vaccine applications, and evaluation of small molecule inhibitors and other therapies. a potential disadvantage of our model is that the lung disease that develops following infection with MERSMA may rely upon species-specific mutations. phenotypes in other mammals studied are mild and do not result in severe MERS-like disease. we reported a small animal model of MERS, the Ad-hDPP4 sensitized mouse (48), and subsequently others (33, 59) generated mice transgenic for hDPP4 using various promoters. mutations arose following 30 in vivo serial passages, including those in the S protein. virulent mouse-adapted MERS-CoV with mutations distinct from those identified here. cell types susceptible to MERS-CoV infection in human lung were first identified in ex vivo studies. innate immune response is a first line of defense against viral infections. dysregulated and excessive immune responses may cause immunopathology and increase morbidity and mortality (65\u201368) clone 6.1.2 and the recombinant MA1.0 and MA2.0 viruses all exhibited S-protein mutations associated with \u201cearly entry\u201d (46), a characteristic of coronaviruses that preferentially use cell-surface transmembrane proteases. the adapted viruses are selected on the basis of their utilization of these transmembrane proteases, such as TMPRSS2 (72, 73) hDPP4 KI mice may be useful in modeling the comorbidities associated with increased mortality in humans. a potential disadvantage of our model is that the lung disease that develops following infection with MERSMA may rely upon species-specific mutations. mutations that arose in the S protein during in vivo serial passage have not been reported in human disease isolates. a congenic C57BL/6 mouse with mouse Dpp4 exons 10\u201312 replaced with the human DPP4 codons was generated by Taconic Biosciences. the targeting vector was generated using BAC clones from the mouse C57BL/6J RPCIB-731 and human RPCIB-753 BAC libraries. PP4 KI mice were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (87.5 mg/kg ketamine/12.5 mg/kg xylazine) and infected intranasally with MERS-CoV in 50 L DMEM. the majority of infections were performed in young, 6- to 8-wk-old mice. two days later, mice were killed, lungs homogenized in PBS, 50 L of clarified lung homogenate was administered to two hDPP4-KI mice intranasally. a single plaque of a mouse-adapted variant of MERS-CoV was infected with serially diluted virus for 1 h. three days after incubation, a single plaque was picked using a sterile Pasteur pipette and transferred into 500 L DMEM. to detect virus N-protein antigen, sections were incubated with a mouse polyclonal antibody. sections were incubated with a biotinylated anti-mouse secondary antibody. incubation followed by sequential incubation with streptavidin\u2013horseradish peroxidase conjugate. mice were killed on 4 d.p.i. and the lungs perfused via the right ventricle with 10 mL PBS. cells were incubated with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies specific for mouse. cDNA was generated using superScript III reverse transcriptase and a random hexamer priming approach. 11 L of total RNA was added to 1 L of FR26RV-N, 1 L of 10 mM dNTP mix, 4 L of 5 First Strand Buffer, 1 L of 0.1 M DTT, 1 L of RNaseOUT. the targeting vector was generated using BAC clones from the mouse C57BL/6J RPCIB-731 and human RPCIB-753 BAC libraries. the targeting vector was generated using BAC clones from the mouse C57BL/6J RPCIB-731 and NM_001935_3 (human) mice were aseptically removed and dissociated in 1 PBS using a manual homogenizer. tissue homogenates were centrifuged and supernatants removed. samples were titered on Vero 81 cells as reported (48). three days after incubation, a single plaque was picked using a sterile Pasteur pipette. the isolated plaques were then thawed to release the viral particles from agarose. cells were grown in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. at least five mice were analyzed per time point and per experimental condition. 1% Evans Blue in 1 PBS was retroorbitally instilled. lungs perfused via right ventricle, followed by 10% formalin perfusion. 5 105 cells were blocked with 1 g anti-CD16/32 antibody. surface stained with the indicated antibodies at 4 \u00b0C. cells were incubated with fluorochrome-labeled antibodies specific for mouse. reverse genetics introduced the MERSMA S-protein mutation into an infectious pBAC-MERSFL. the full-length BAC cDNA clone was transfected into Huh7 cells to rescue the recombinant virus."}
