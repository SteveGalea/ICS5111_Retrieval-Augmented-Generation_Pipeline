{"summary": "the first RNA virus to be molecularly cloned was bacteriophage Q, a positive-strand RNA virus that infects Escherichia coli. a plasmid containing a full-length cDNA of the poliovirus genomic RNA was infectious when transfected into mammalian cells. this technique was applied to poliovirus, a positive-strand RNA virus of humans and animals. a large RNA genome of 10-32 kb presents three major obstacles to the cloning of a full-length functional cDNA. the first difficulty is the synthesis of a faithful cDNA copy, since the fidelity of RT-PCR is proportional to the length of the viral RNA. JEV is a zoonotic flavivirus33 that is transmitted in nature between birds, pigs, and other vertebrate hosts by mosquito vectors. in humans, JEV infection can cause the severe neurological disease Japanese encephalitis (JE),36 which occurs in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. both the 5' and 3' NCRs contain conserved primary sequences and form RNA secondary/tertiary structures. 60-62 are important for modulating viral RNA replication. this protocol describes the tools, methods, and strategies for generating a full-length infectious BAC of JEV SA14-14-2. homogenize the mixture by hand-shaking the tube vigorously for 30 sec. add 160 l of chloroform to the homogenized sample. centrifuge the total lysate at 13,400 g for 15 min at 4 \u00b0C. transfer the upper aqueous phase containing the RNA to a new microtube. l of purified RNA, 1 l 10 mM dNTP mix, 1 l 4 pmol/l primer, and 1 l dH2O. add 4 l 5 RT buffer, 1 l 0.1 M DTT, 1 l 40 U/l RNase inhibitor, and 1 l 200 U/l reverse transcriptase. heat-inactivate sample at 70 \u00b0C for 15 min. pBAC/F1 to pBAC/F4 is a potent mutagen and requires lab coats, safety glasses, and gloves to be worn. subclone each of the four cDNA fragments into a BAC Vector to create pBAC/F1 to pBAC/F4. g DNA, 20 U enzyme, 1 digestion buffer, and 1 BSA. purify desired vector and insert DNA fragments by gel extraction. cut out a band of desired DNA fragment with a minimal amount of agarose. centrifuge the mixture at 13,400 g for 10 min at RT. air-dry the DNA pellet for 10 min and dissolve it in 20 l of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl and 1 mM EDTA [pH 7.6]) ligation reaction to 100 l of the thawed cells in a 1.7 ml microtube. heat-shock the DNA-cell mixture for 45 sec in a 42 \u00b0C water bath. add 900 l of LB broth pre-warmed to RT. inoculating 500 l of positive bacterial cultures in 500 ml of 2xYT-Cml medium and cultivating the inoculum for 6 hr at 35 \u00b0C while shaking at 225-250 rpm.

Presented is an example of the CsCl-EtBr gradient using a 16 76 mm sealable polypropylene tube. the full-length JEV SA14-14-2 cDNA is cut with Xba I and treated with MBN. BHK-21 cells are mock-electroporated (Mock) or electroporated with the RNA transcripts derived from each of the two independent clones of the full-length JEV BAC (Cl.1 and Cl.2). RNA infectivity is determined by infectious center assays to estimate the amount of infectious RNA electroporated into the cells. cloning cDNA is a key step in developing a reverse genetics system for positive-strand RNA viruses. it acts as viral mRNA that is translated into proteins by host cell ribosomes. the availability of an infectious cDNA clone has increased our understanding of the viral life cycle at the molecular level. authentic 5'- and 3'-ends were ensured by placing the SP6 promoter sequence upstream of the first adenine nucleotide of the viral genome and positioning a unique artificial Xba I restriction site downstream of the last thymine nucleotide of the viral genome. this protocol can be modified in several ways. BAC technology has been applied to constructing infectious cDNA clones for a handful of positive-strand RNA viruses. the cDNA template itself is not infectious, because the cDNA template itself is not infectious. the main advantage of using BACs is the high genetic stability of the large, 1- or 2-copy BAC plasmids. the BAC-transformed E. coli DH10B is transformed with the infectious BAC pBAC/SA14-14-2 in a nutrient-rich medium, 2xYT. the average yield is only 15 g of BAC DNA from 500 ml of 2xYT broth. the purity of the BAC DNA is best achieved by using CsCl-EtBr density gradient centrifugation."}
