{"summary": "coat proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates need to transport from one compartment to another. coat proteins and lipids can be retrieved from the cis-Golgi compartments to the ER via COPI vesicles. these transport pathways are essential for development and homeostasis. Gbf1 consists of multiple domains, including the N-terminal DCB domain for dimerization and HUS domain probably for membrane recruitment. the middle sec7 domain essential for the GEF activity and membrane recruitment, and the C-terminal HDS domains (HDS1\u2013HDS3) possibly for intracellular destination. 24.75% of embryos (n = 298) from crosses between heterozygotes started to show reduced pigmentation in the head and much shorter caudal fin at 36 hpf. at 48 hpf, 95% of mutant embryos (n = 137) developed hemorrhage in the head and/or in the trunk region. tsu3994 mutant allele was introduced into the Tg(fli1a:EGFP) transgenic background. the vasculature system of mutant embryos is normal before 30 hpf. at 48 hpf, some vessels, primarily intracerebral vessels in the head and intersegmental vessels (ISVs) in mutants are almost lost completely. vasculature integrity and homeostasis may have been disrupted in mutants. tsu3994 mutant embryos were labeled by GFP (green) and DsRed (red). tsu3994 mutant embryos are cell autonomous. we performed cell transplantation between tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) and Tg(kdrl:mCherry) transgenic embryos at the shield stage. we observed trunk ECs differentiated from donor cells at 48 and 60 hpf. the donor-derived ECs showed a survival rate of 100% at 48 hpf and 93.48% at 60 hpf (n = 92) tsu3994 mutation site was narrowed to 140-kb region. gbf1 in mutant embryos carried a T G single nucleotide substitution. this mutation is predicted to cause a leucine arginine substitution (L1246R for X5 isoform of Gbf1) in gene. initial mapping positioned the mutation site around the markers z6104 and z6259 on chromosome 13. arrows and arrowheads indicate the polymorphic bands derived from Tu and India alleles. gbf1 is maternally and zygotically expressed; its transcripts are ubiquitously distributed at early stages but enriched in the head region at later stages in WT embryos. gbf1 is also expressed in endothelial cells isolated from Tg(kdrl:GFP) embryos (Fig. 3I), which is consistent with its cell autonomous function in the vasculature. gbf1tsu-cd7 and gbf1tsu-ci20 mutations carried a 7-bp deletion and a 20-bp insertion. both mutations caused a frameshift, presumably resulting in a truncated Gbf1 protein lacking the HDS2, HDS3 and C-terminal proline-rich domains. tsu3994 mutant phenotype could be simulated by treating WT embryo wild-type embryos at the one-cell stage were injected and observed for GFP fluorescence by fluorescent microscopy at the shield stage. morphants showed hemorrhage (indicated by arrowheads) at 96 hpf with statistical data on the right. both Flag-Gbf1 (WT) and Flag-Gbf1(L1246R) of the zebrafish origin were slightly enriched in the cis-Golgi marked by the cis-Golgi tethering protein GM130. less Flag-Gbf1(L1246R) was recruited to the Golgi apparatus. more dispersed and weaker GM130 signals may be caused by partial disruption of the Golgi apparatus. fold of enrichment at Golgi was expressed as the ratio of the Flag-Gbf1 signal co-localized with the GM130-labeled Golgi region to the Flag-Gbf1 signal in the whole cell. flag-Gbf1 with different residues at the position 1246 showed different locations in HeLa cells. the cells transfected with different expression constructs were treated for 12 h with 10 m GCA before harvest. the addition of GCA, which inhibits function of endogenous GBF1 and causes Golgi fragmentation, resulted in decentralized distribution of overexpressed Arf1-GFP. however, the accumulation of Arf1-GFP in the Golgi apparatus was achieved in the presence of GCA by overexpressing Flag-Gbf1(M830L) but not Flag-Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) largely rescued the integrity of the G, relative enrichment of Arf1-GFP signal in the Golgi region. the ratio of Arf1-GFP signal within the GM130+ Golgi region to the Arf1-GFP signal in the whole cell with background noise deducted. the number of disconnected Golgi fragments marked by GM130 within a cell was counted. flag-tagged Gbf1(M830L) or Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) was transfected into HeLa cells. transfected cells were harvested for immunodetection of Flag-Gbf1 and endogenous -COP 12 h post DMSO (A\u2013C) or GCA treatment (D\u2013F) gene ontology term analysis revealed markedly increased expression levels of genes for vesicle transport, in particular for vesicle coatomer proteins. real time RT-PCR analysis confirmed the significant increase of expression levels of copa, arcn1a, and copg2 in mutant kdrl:GFP+ endothelial cells. impaired vesicle trafficking in mutant endothelial cells evoke unknown compensatory mechanisms to increase expression levels of ves embryos were immunostained for active caspase 3 (red) and GFP (green) at 36 and 48 hpf. arrowheads indicated the apoptotic endothelial cells in mutants. mutant embryos also had more apoptotic cells outside the vasculature. treatment with the ER stress and apoptosis inhibitor TUDCA (35) and knockdown of baxb showed an even better effect. knockdown of badb or inhibition of the stress sensor protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) could reduce the proportion of mutant embryos with severe hemorrhage. however, knockdown of ddit3 and tp53 had no effect on hemorrhage the head tended to have more bleeding sites than the trunk region. all of mutant embryos died before 96 hpf. our subsequent study focused on the hemorrhage phenotype. tsu3994 mutant embryos were generated in the Tg(kdrl:GFP;gata1a:DsRed) double transgenic background. intracerebral vessels and ISVs collapsed at some sites, resulting in disassociation of endothelial cells. tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) Mt and sibling (Sib) embryos and Tg(kdrl:mCherry) transgenic embryos were used for transplantation at the shield stage. host embryos were observed by confocal microscopy at 48 hpf (E and E\u2032) and 60 hpf (F and F\u2032) tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) donor cells were transplanted into tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) mutant host embryos. the donor-derived ECs still showed a survival rate of 100% at 48 hpf and 93.48% at 60 hpf (n = 92), even if the adjacent vessels were broken. gbf1 in mutant embryos carried a T G single nucleotide substitution in the 23rd exon. this mutation is predicted to cause a leucine arginine substitution (L1246R for X5 isoform of Gbf1) in Gbf1 protein. the full-length Gbf1 X5 isoform (WT) consists of 1846 residues. mutated leucine residue (boxed) of gbf1 is evolutionally conserved across different species. expression levels of gbf1 and cdh5 in kdrl:GFP+ ECs and in kdrl:GFP non-ECs sorted from Tg(kdrl:GFP) embryos at 48 hpf were analyzed by RT-PCR. injection of 100 pg of gbf1 mutant mRNA at the one-cell stage could partially and temporally ameliorate the mutant phenotypes. in contrast, injection of gbf1 mutant mRNA neither caused any phenotype in WT embryos nor rescued the mutant phenotype in mutant embryos. this suggests the mutant Gbf1 is a loss of function form rather than a dominant negative form. u-3994/+ gbf1tsu-cd7/+, gbf1tsu-ci20/+, or gbf1tsu-ci20/+ crosses developed hemorrhage at 48 hpf. the tsu3994 mutant phenotype is caused by loss of function of gbf1. tsu3994 mutants could arise from nonspecific effect. top panel showed the gRNA-recognized sequence. bottom panel shows similar phenotypes of mutants carrying two different mutant alleles. cis-Golgi tethering protein GM130 was prominently enriched in the cis-Golgi region (Fig. 5, C, E, and G) less Flag-Gbf1(L1246R) was recruited to the Golgi apparatus (Fig. 5, D, F, and G) these results suggest that the Leu Arg mutation disrupts the Golgi targeting property of Gbf1 protein. the flag-Gbf1 signal co-localized with the GM130-labeled Golgi region to the Flag-Gbf1 signal in the whole cell. nc, observed number of cells; ns, statistically nonsignificant; ***, p 0.001. the -helix property plotted by HELIQUEST suggests that the L1246R substitution leads to loss of the hydrophobic face. Gbf1(L1246R) Fails to Activate Arf1 for Recruiting COPI Complex Activation of Arf1 by a guanine exchange factor such as Gbf1 is important for maintaining the ER and Golgi integrity. we evaluated the Gbf1 GEF activity by essaying Golgi enrichment of zebrafish Arf1 in HeLa cells. overexpression of Flag-Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) largely rescued the integrity of the Golgi apparatus disrupted by GCA treatment. therefore, Gbf1(L1246R) mutant protein lacks the activity to restore Golgi integrity and Arf1 recruitment in cells lacking endogenous GBF1 activity. Gbf1(L1246R) mutant protein fails to recruit -COP to the golgi apparatus. -COP protein was located on transporting vesicles with enrichment in perinuclear region. -COP was enhanced by transfection of flag-Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) expression. expression of Gbf1(M830L) promoted recruitment of -COP to the perinuclear Golgi region (B and E), whereas Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) expression had no effect (C and F) Arrows in (B and E) indicated cells with low level Gbf1(M830L) expression. kdrl:GFP+ ECs were sorted from tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) mutant embryos at 44 hpf. gene numbers mapped to zebrafish genome assembly version Zv10 in different samples. tsu3994 mutants have more apoptotic endothelial cells. treatment with ER stress and apoptosis inhibitor TUDCA and knockdown of baxb was found to prevent bleeding in mutant embryos. knockdown of ddit3 and tp53 had no effect on hemorrhage occurrence. it is likely that impaired vesicle trafficking and cargo transportation trigger ER stress and apoptosis in endothelial cells. defects in pigmentation and fins in tsu3994 were not obviously compromised by TUDCA treatment or/and baxb knockdown. tsu3994 mutant allele was introduced into the Tg(fli1a:EGFP) transgenic background at 48 hpf. some intracerebral vessels in the head and intersegmental vessels (ISVs) in the trunk are broken or disappeared. vascular defects in mutant embryos in mutants in Tg(fli1a:EGFP) transgenic background at 48 hpf. su3994 mutant embryos were generated in the Tg(kdrl:GFP;gata1a:DsRed) double transgenic background. in mutant embryos, gata1a-positive blood cells circulated normally through the vasculature from 38 to 48 hpf. intracerebral vessels and ISVs collapsed at some sites, resulting in disassociation of endothelial cells. ocal microscopy at 48 hpf (E and E\u2032) and 60 hpf (F and F\u2032) arrowheads and arrows indicate deforming mutant donor ECs (green) in a WT host embryo and surviving donor WT ECs in a mutant host embryo. 44% of donor-derived ECs derived from tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) donors were deforming at 48 hpf. all of these donor-derived ECs disappeared or deformed at 60 hpf. this indicates that the vascular defect in tsu3994 mutants is cell autonomous. the full-length Gbf1 X5 isoform (WT) consists of 1846 residues and the L1246R mutation resides in the highly conserved HDS2 domain (13, 24) as shown in Fig. 3 (E and F), the WT and mutant alleles could be precisely identified by PCR using a common reverse primer (R primer) kdrl:GFP+ ECs and in kdrl:GFP non-ECs sorted from Tg(kdrl:GFP) embryos at 48 hpf were analyzed by RT-PCR. gbf1 is maternally and zygotically expressed; its transcripts are ubiquitously distributed at early stages but enriched in the head region at later stages in WT embryos. injection with high doses (>4 ng) impaired early development of embryos. morphants developed hemorrhage phenotype mimicking mutant embryos. at a lower dose (2 ng), gbf1 mutant lines developed hemorrhage phenotype. tsu3994 mutant phenotype is caused by loss of function of gbf1. Embryos were injected at the one-cell stage with 100 pg gbf1 mRNA. the bleeding sites are indicated by arrows. the head and posterior trunk are shown in the middle and bottom panels. the ratio of embryos with the representative morphology is indicated. the mutation disrupts the Golgi targeting property of Gbf1 protein. Gbf1(L1246R) mutant protein is unable to be recruited to the Golgi apparatus in HeLa cells. insets are boxed areas showing co-localization of exogenous Gbf1. more dispersed and weaker GM130 signals may be caused by partial disruption of the Golgi apparatus. replacement of leu1246 by the strong hydrophilic amino acids Asn, Arg, Lys, and Glu altered Flag-Gbf1 distribution. substitution by other hydrophobic or weaker hydrophilic amino acids had no or little effect. thus, the hydrophobic face of the fifth -helix in the HDS2 domain is required for Gbf1 translocation to the Golgi apparatus. we introduced the M830L mutation into Flag-Gfb1 and Flag-Gfb1(L1246R) to generate Flag-Gfb1(M830L) and Flag-Gfb1(M830L;L1246R), respectively. this should confer insensitiveness to BFA/GCA treatment as does human GBF1(M832L) (26). orescent detection of exogenous tagged fusion proteins and GM130-positive cis-Golgi compartment in the absence (A\u2013C) or presence (D\u2013F) of GCA in the cis-Golgi region. the mutation in Gbf1 confers insensitivity to GCA treatment. flag-tagged Gbf1(M830L) or Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) was transfected into HeLa cells. the transfected cells were harvested for immunodetection of Flag-Gbf1 and endogenous -COP 12 h post DMSO (A\u2013C) or GCA treatment (D\u2013F). the cells were harvested for immunodetection of Flag-Gbf1 and endogenous -COP 12 kdrl:GFP+ ECs were sorted from tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) mutant or sibling embryos at 44 hpf for RNA-Seq analysis. compared with kdrl:GFP+ ECs from mutants, ECs had 1063 up-regulated and 132 down-regulated genes (>2.0-fold with false discovery rate of 0.001) gene expression levels of several vesicle coat genes and ER stress/apoptosis-related genes were analyzed at indicated stages by real time quantitative PCR. mutant embryos also had more apoptotic cells outside the vasculature that are likely to include blood cells leaking from broken vessels. tsu3994 mutants may have more apoptotic endothelial cells. we guessed that tsu3994 mutants might have more apoptotic endothelial cells. tsu3994 mutants may have more apoptotic endothelial cells. in mammals, Ddit3, Bad, and Bax can promote cell death. 24.75% of embryos from crosses between heterozygotes started to show reduced pigmentation in the head and much shorter caudal fin at 36 hpf. at 48 hpf, 95% of mutant embryos (n = 137) developed hemorrhage in the head and/or in the trunk region. all of mutant embryos died before 96 hpf. the vasculature system of mutant embryos is normal before 30 hpf. however, at 48 hpf, some vessels, primarily intracerebral vessels in the head and intersegmental vessels (ISVs) in mutants are almost lost completely. in mutant embryos, intracerebral vessels and ISVs collapsed at some sites, resulting in disassociation of endothelial cells. tsu3994 mutant embryos showed vascular breakage in the intracerebral (B) and intersegmental vessels (D) of mutants. tsu3994 is cell autonomous to determine the cellular origin of the vascular defect in tsu3994. u3994 performed cell transplantation between tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) and Tg(kdrl:mCherry) transgenic embryos at the shield stage. ECs differentiated from transplanted tsu3994;Tg(kdrl:GFP) donor cells at 48 and 60 hpf. donor-derived ECs showed a survival rate of 100% at 48 hpf and 93.48% gbf1 in mutant embryos carried a T G single nucleotide substitution in the 23rd exon. this mutation is predicted to cause a leucine arginine substitution (L1246R for X5 isoform of Gbf1) in Gbf1 protein, highly conserved across animal species from Caenorhabditis elegans to human. initial mapping positioned the mutation site around the markers z6104 and z6259 on chromosome 13. arrowheads indicate the polymorphic bands derived from Tu and India alleles. gbf1 is also expressed in endothelial cells isolated from Tg(kdrl:GFP) embryos. the expression level of gbf1 appeared to be higher as a whole. in mutant embryos, the expression level of gbf1 appeared to be higher as a whole. gbf1tsu-cd7 and gbf1tsu-ci20 mutations carried a 7-bp deletion and a 20-bp insertion respectively. both mutations caused a frameshift, presumably resulting in a truncated Gbf1 protein lacking the HDS2, HDS3 and C-terminal proline-rich domains. 25% of embryos derived from gbf1tsu-3994/ wild-type embryos at the one-cell stage were injected and observed for gFP fluorescence by fluorescent microscopy at the shield stage. morphants showed hemorrhage (indicated by arrowheads) at 96 hpf with statistical data on the right. both Flag-Gbf1 (WT) and Flag-Gbf1(L1246R) of the zebrafish origin were slightly enriched in the cis-Golgi marked by the cis-Golgi tethering protein GM130. less Flag-Gbf1(L1246R) was recruited to the Golgi apparatus. more dispersed and weaker GM130 signals in BFA- or GCA-treated cells (C\u2013F) may be caused by partial disruption of the Golgi apparatus because of inhibition of endogenous Gbf1. fold of enrichment at Golgi was expressed as the ratio of the Flag-Gbf1 signal co-localized with the GM130-labeled Golgi region to the Flag-Gbf1 signal in the whole cell. flag-Gbf1 with different residues at the position 1246 showed different locations in HeLa cells. the cells transfected with different expression constructs were treated for 12 h with 10 m GCA. the addition of GCA, which inhibits function of endogenous GBF1 and causes Golgi fragmentation, resulted in decentralized distribution of overexpressed Arf1-GFP. however, the accumulation of Arf1-GFP in the Golgi apparatus was achieved in the presence of GCA by overexpressing Flag-Gbf1(M830L) but not Flag-Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) largely rescued the integrity of the f1(M830L) (E) but not Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) (F) relative enrichment of Arf1-GFP signal in the Golgi region. the ratio of Arf1-GFP signal within the GM130+ Golgi region to the Arf1-GFP signal in the whole cell with background noise deducted. flag-tagged Gbf1(M830L) or Gbf1(M830L;L1246R) was transfected into HeLa cells. cells were harvested for immunodetection of Flag-Gbf1 and endogenous -COP 12 h post DMSO (A\u2013C) or GCA treatment (D\u2013F) expression levels of copa, arcn1a, and copg2 increased in mutant kdrl:GFP+ endothelial cells. impaired vesicle trafficking in mutant endothelial cells evokes unknown compensatory mechanisms to increase expression levels of vesicle coatomer genes. the average number of Caspase 3+ endothelial cells within four intersegmental vessels was shown on the right. the treated or MO-injected embryos were subjected to O-dianisidine staining at 48 hpf. the mutants were classified into three categories as exemplified on the top. knockdown of badb or inhibition of the stress sensor protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) could reduce the proportion of mutant embryos with severe hemorrhage. but knockdown of ddit3 and tp53 had no effect on hemorrhage occurrence. defects in pigmentation and fins in tsu3994 were not obviously compromised by TUDCA treatment. phenotype of the zebrafish gbf1 mutant is similar to human autosomal recessive inherited Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome. it is characterized by hypopigmentation and bleeding tendency and is ascribed to mutations of genes involved in vesicle trafficking and protein secretion (36, 37). zebrafish genome encodes other large ARF-GEFs such as big2/arfgef2 and big3/arfgef3. unaffected tissues in gbf1 mutants may associate with redundant expression of other ARF-GEF genes. ingen males aged 4\u20138 months were mutagenized and bred as described (43, 44) when a mutant was identified, the F2 heterozygotes were crossed to Tg(fli1a:EGFP) or Tg(kdrl:GFP;gata1a:DsRed) to monitor vascular system and also crossed to India strain for mapping. the coding sequence of zebrafish arf1 was amplified and cloned into pEGFP-N3 vector (Clontech) for making gbf1 in situ probe, a 3\u2032 fragment of the coding region was amplified (5\u2032-TCCCGCACAGGATACTCAGA-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-GAAACGAGGAGAGGCAACCA-3\u2032 (reverse) RT-PCR and real time quantitative PCR were performed to check mRNA expression levels of the tested genes. the primer sequences were: for gbf1, 5\u2032-TGGACAAGTACATGCACGCT-3\u2032 (forward) and 5\u2032-TGTCTGTTCGATCACCGTTGG-3\u2032 (reverse); for cdh5, 5\u2032-TGGAATGAGTGTCAGTGC-3\u2032 (forward)

injection dose was the amount of the MO or mRNA received by a single embryo. whole Mount in Situ Hybridization and O-Dianisidine Staining Embryos were incubated in Holtfreter's solution containing 0.003% PTU to inhibit melanization from the bud stage to the desired stage. gRNA targeting the 23rd exon (5\u2032-AGCGAACAATCAGGGCTCAGAGG-3\u2032) was co-injected with Cas9 mRNA. transplanted embryos were cultured in Holtfreter's solution containing 0.003% PTU and 0.1% penicillin/streptomycin in a 48-well plate with the bottom covered by 1% agarose. individual donors and hosts were genotyped by PCR at later stages. cells were cultured for 24 h, followed by incubation in 10 g/ml of BFA for 10 min or in 10 m GCA for 30 min or 12 h. if otherwise specified, embryos were raised in Holtfreter's solution. gene mapping was performed as described previously (23). a 349-bp fragment covering the mutant site was amplified with the forward primer F(T) or F(G) (5\u2032-TACGGCTTGCATGAGCTGCG-3\u2032 for the mutant allele) and the reverse primer (5\u2032-TCTGGATTTGCTCGT-3\u2032) mutants beyond about 36 hpf were identified by morphological changes. antibodies and reagents Following antibodies were

Zebrafish Strains and Maintenance Fish or embryos of the Tuebingen (Tu) and India strain were used. cDNAs were of the zebrafish origin and the transcript variant X5 of gbf1 was used in this study. for in vitro mRNA synthesis, the coding sequence plus 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-UTR of zebrafish gbf1 was amplified and cloned into the pXT7 vector using enzymatic assembly method (45) rabbit anti-Flag (catalog no.

Founder fish (F0) carrying deletion mutations and corre sponding F1 embryos were raised up. Tg(kdrl:GFP;gata1a:DsRed) embryos were used for time lapse imaging from 38 to 48 hpf under Olympus FV1200 confocal microscope. gbf1tsu3994/+ at 44 hpf were dechorionated and disintegrated completely to prepare single-cell suspension. the transgenic lines Tg(fli1a:EGFP)y1 (21), Tg(gata1a:DsRed)sd2Tg (40) and Tg(kdrl:GFP)s843Tg (41) were described before. embryos were raised in Holtfreter's solution at 28.5 \u00b0C. full-length coding sequence of gbf1 was amplified and cloned into pCS2(+) vector with a Flag tag at the N terminus. for overexpression in HeLa cells, full-length coding sequence of gbf1 was amplified and cloned into pCS2(+) vector with a Flag tag at the N terminus.
