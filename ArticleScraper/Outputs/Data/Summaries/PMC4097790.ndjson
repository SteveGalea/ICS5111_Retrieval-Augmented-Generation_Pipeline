{"summary": "MERS-CoV has a high mortality rate in humans and continues to spread worldwide. there are currently no effective therapeutics or vaccines. miR-181c inhibits HCV replication by binding directly to the viral E1 and NS5A sequences. swarm of isogenic infectious molecular clones designed to be biologically equivalent but discriminable by short amplicon sequencing. RIOK3 interacts with TBK1 and IRF3 and bridges the functions between these two key kinases in the type I IFN production pathway. this study reveals previously unknown functions of RIOK3."}
