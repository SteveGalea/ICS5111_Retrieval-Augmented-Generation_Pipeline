{"summary": "four species of endemic human coronavirus (HCoV) currently recognized by the international committee for the taxonomy of Viruses. HCoV-OC43, -229E, -NL63, and -HKU1, and two epidemic CoVs, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV discovered in 2003 and 2012, respectively. a total of 59,704,490 sequencing reads from 2 150-bp paired ends were used for data analysis. a total of 6,475,827 reads mapped to HCoV-HKU1 at a depth of 29,000, which covered the whole genome of 29,811 bp. this is the first complete genome of HCoV-HKU1 isolated from Thailand. strategy and viral characterization pipeline provide valuable insight into the circulation of endemic infectious diseases in Thailand. the whole-genome sequence of HCoV-HKU1 from Thailand is colored in blue. it belonged to group B genotype and closely related to HCoV-HKU1 from Hong Kong."}
