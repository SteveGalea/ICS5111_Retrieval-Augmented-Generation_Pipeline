{"summary": "glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is the production of ribose and the reducing equivalent nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) both products are vital for the synthesis of many biological building blocks, such as nucleic and fatty acids. it has long been known that NADPH is extremely important in the maintenance of antioxidant defenses. the current review provides an update of the existing knowledge concerning G6PD. focuses on how G6PD is involved in redox signaling and how it affects cell survival and death, particularly in diseases such as cancer. the relationship between G6PD and redox signaling is discussed. interaction between NO and ROS generates RNS. both ROS and RNS react with cysteine thiols to form RSS. RSI increases fitness and flexibility at cell, tissue, and organismal level. the ventricular tissue homogenates show an increase in NADPH, superoxide, and G6PD activity. treatment with a NOX inhibitor gp91(ds-tat) or a G6PD inhibitor, 6-aminonicotinamide (6-AN) significantly reduces superoxide generation in the failing heart homogenates. granulocytes lacking G6PD fail to generate NO in the presence of LPS or PMA. IL-1 upregulates G6PD activity and reduces cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels. cAMP-dependent PKA enhances G6PD status stimulated by IL-1-derived NO. G6PD-deficient endothelial cells display lower level of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), NO, and glutathione (GSH) treatment of G6PD-deficient endothelial cells with high concentrations of glucose as a pro-atherosclerotic stimulus upregulates ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, as well as the oxidant markers, ROS, NOX4 and iNOS. overexpression of G6PD confers resistance to NO-mediated apoptosis. overexpression of G6PD confers resistance to apoptosis, while G6PD knockdown exacerbates cellular injury. carbon monoxide (CO) is also a gaseous signaling molecule produced in humans. the major roles of CO are modulation of the cardiovascular system, inhibition of platelet aggregation and adhesion, and neuronal development. the abnormal metabolism of CO has been associated with diseases. pulmonary vessel dilation, diabetes, hypertension, kidney disease, and brain injuries are major antioxidant defense systems in cells. regulation of these enzymes profoundly affects the development and clinical outcome of diseases. hyperglycemia is one of the pro-inflammatory conditions leading to vascular injuries. a decrease in G6PD expression and activity induced by ubiquitination and an increase in ROS in podocytes occurs at high glucose concentrations. hyperglycemia in obese mice causes increased oxidative stress in vascular endothelial cells and causes cardiovascular complications. G6PD-deficient macrophages have decreased phosphorylation of MAPK, nuclear translocation of NF-B, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and ROS accumulation. these events lead to enhanced insulin sensitivity in lipid-overload hepatocytes. but lack of G6PD activity is a risk factor for neonatal sepsis in males. low G6PD activity in children following acute hepatitis infection may cause high morbidity [114] hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a hallmark of chronic liver failure (CLF) G6PD overactivation contributes to remodeling of pulmonary arterial. production of superoxide by NADPH oxidase (NOX) and nitric oxide (NO) by NO synthase (NOS) is NADPH-dependent. high molecular weight signaling molecules play an important role in human health. endogenous H2S plays a role in diverse biochemical pathways governing signal transduction, bioenergetics, and lifespan. the inhalation of H2S by mice causes hibernation-like behavior associated with reduced body temperature and metabolism. RSI increases fitness and flexibility at cell, tissue, and organismal level through rapid sensing and adjustment. G6PD regulates nuclear superoxide production by cooperating with NOX4 in the hepatocytes. the close relationship between G6PD and NOX4 maintains ROS homeostasis. overexpression of G6PD in bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAECs) diminishes ROS accumulation. 8-bromo-cAMP, an activator of cAMP-dependent protein kinase, increases G6PD activity. a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor decreases G6PD activity. cAMP-dependent PKA enhances G6PD status stimulated by IL-1-derived NO. oxidant markers, ROS, NOX4, and iNOS play a role in endothelial cell protection associated with NO availability. l-cysteine suggests that G6PD and GSH play a role in endothelial cell protection associated with NO availability. treatment with the -adrenergic receptor (-AR) suppresses the hypertrophy stimulated by the -AR in cardiomyocytes. -AR upregulates G6PD expression and activity in rats with cardiac hypertrophy. CO is produced from hemoglobin by heme oxygenase 1 and 2. it can be used as an index of heme catabolism. endogenous CO is increased in G6PD-deficient neonates with hyperbilirubinemia. the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-1 primes high glucose-induced vascular inflammation. IL-1 activates the PPP, where excess glucose reroutes to this pathway. this in turn overactivates NOX, which produces superoxide and its reaction with neighboring molecules. glycemia in obese mice results in increased oxidative stress in adipose tissue. smaller islets and impaired glucose tolerance are observed in G6PD-deficient mice. upregulation of G6PD occurs in pancreatic -cells in diabetic murine models. lipid-overload hepatocytes are associated with impaired pro-inflammatory cytokines via NF-B and oxidative stress. lack of G6PD activity is a risk factor for neonatal sepsis in males. ALI suppresses airway inflammation in airway epithelial cells. hepatic encephalopathy (MHE) is a hallmark of chronic liver failure (CLF) increased levels of nNOS and NO are associated with increased activity of NADPH diaphorase in the cerebellum of CLF rats. increased level of nNOS and NO is associated with increased activity of NADPH diaphorase in the cerebellum of CLF rats. rapidly growing cancer cells have evolved myriad mechanisms to activate G6PD for supporting the cellular requirements for NADPH production and fatty acid and nucleic acid synthesis. HSPB1 activates G6PD through SIRT2 leading to deacetylation and activation of G6PD. cancer type effects of G6PD Deficiency Mechanism Reference Breast Enhanced proliferation and migration Nrf2 upregulates Notch1 and HES-1(proliferation) via G6PD/HIF-1. increased glucose uptake and NADPH production Histone deacetylase inhibitor reprograms metabolism by upregulating G6PD. breast Reduced cell proliferation, cell survival, increased ROS, decreased ribose (in combination with TKT deficiency) Increased lipid synthesis [25] Increased autophagosome, impairment of autophagy flux, increased lapatinib-induced cytotoxicity Induced endoplasmic reticulum stress. upregulation miR-1 inhibits G6PD [19] Multiple cancers Reduction of ribonucleotide and GSH and cell proliferation Phase 2 drug (RRx-001) downregulates G6PD [56] 3.1. STAT proteins are transcription factors involved in immunity and cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and differentiation. G6PD status in melanoma cells is positively correlated with the expression of the cell cycle proteins, including cyclin D1 and cyclin E [158] lack of G6PD in mice enhances apoptosis by upregulating Fas and downregulating Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL. ID1 is involved in delaying replicative senescence, inhibition of differentiation, enhancement of proliferation, invasion, immortalization, and metastases. Elevated ID1 is correlated with a poor clinical outcome which includes shorter survival or resistance to therapies in breast, cervical, and non-small cell lung cancers. silencing ID1 reduces proliferation and induces apoptosis. AMPK AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is ubiquitous in eukaryotes. it contains a protein kinase domain (subunit), a glycogen binding domain (subunit), and four cystathionine-synthase domains (subunit) AMPK regulates cell growth and reprograms metabolism through transcription and by interacting with metabolic enzymes. detached breast cancer cells have reduced glucose uptake, lactic acid, and ATP. detached cells shift glycolysis to the PPP in order to maintain redox homeostasis, while fatty acid oxidation is enhanced to support ATP. members of the p21-activated kinases are serine/threonine protein kinases. role of PAKs includes cell survival, cytoskeletal reorganization, gene transcription, and cell transformation. overexpression of PAK4 in colon cancer cells enhances glucose and NADPH production. PAK4 inhibits p53 transcriptional activity by direct binding and enhancement of p53 degradation through the Mdm2 component, E3 ligase. PAK4 knockdown reduces the level of Mdm2 and p53. mice injected with wild-type G6PD cells display faster tumor formation. tumors of wild-type G6PD cells are more aggressively malignant compared to those with G6PD-deficient cells. this suggests that G6PD status is vital to melanoma proliferation and differentiation. cellular ID1 is involved in delaying replicative senescence, inhibition of differentiation, enhancement of proliferation, invasion, immortalization, and metastases. the potential oncogene ID1 is found in several cancers in humans, including breast, kidney, pancreas, and prostate cancers. c-Myc regulates many genes that are involved in energy and glucose metabolism. c-Myc activates c-Myc through Wnt/-catenin. c-Myc is essential for regulation of cell cycle progression and metabolic adaptation. anchorage-independent growth is found in human breast cancer cells. detached cells have reduced glucose uptake, lactic acid, and ATP. GL-V9 inhibits anchorage-independent growth through an increase in ROS. PAK4/Mdm2/E3/p53 The tumor suppressor p53 is a highly mutated gene in human cancers. p53 regulates its function by preventing G6PD dimerization. Mutants of p53 in tumors lack G6PD-inhibitory activity. p53 is a downstream protein of PAK4 [48,187]. in vitro translated p53 binds to PAK4 suggesting that p53 interacts with PAK4. ubiquitin proteasome pathway modulates p53 degradation. regulated cell death (RCD), accidental cell death, and necroptosis may occur at the same time. downregulation of G6PD impairs most cellular functions, especially regarding cell survival. apoptosis Apoptosis Apoptosis (extrinsic apoptosis) is the most common cell death caused by inhibition. increased glucose levels impair G6PD activity and result in apoptosis in kidney podocytes mediated by ubiquitination of G6PD at K366 and K403 [128]. ubiquitinated G6PD protein is degraded by the ubiquitin proteasome pathway, and cellular redox homeostasis becomes unbalanced by the increased oxidative stress. autophagy is modulated by redox homeostasis and glucose NETotic cell death is another form of cell death in neutrophils by producing neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) it is considered as regulated form of necrosis [205]. severe G6PD deficiency increases the susceptibility to infection by the absence of NETotic cell death. ubiquitinated protein binds to G6PD and undergoes ubiquitination in kidney podocytes. cellular redox homeostasis becomes unbalanced by increased oxidative stress. autophagy is modulated by redox homeostasis and glucose metabolism. NETotic cell death is another form of cell death in neutrophils by producing neutrophil extracellular traps. it is considered as regulated form of necrosis [205] the function of NETs is to trap bacteria and kill them by protruding filaments consisting of fragmented chromatin and antimicrobial peptides. noncompetitive inhibitor of mammalian G6PD decreases cellular NADPH levels and NADPH-dependent ROS production. PD causes cell cycle arrest in the S phase, inducing about 50% apoptosis and inhibiting about 60% invasion. a phase II clinical trial shows PD is well tolerated in humans. ZA inhibits cell proliferation by decreasing expression of G6PD in bladder cancer cells. stability of TAp73 is decreased in ZA-treated bladder cancer cells through inhibition of Ras activity. this suggests that ZA can inhibit TAp73 stability and decrease G6PD activity via blocking Ras signaling. the use of RNA co-immunoprecipitation reveals that GAS5 interacts with G6PD. this results in inhibition of G6PD and NOX activity leading to a decrease in superoxide and NADP+. this results in a decrease in superoxide and NADP+. oprotein with three components includes a human telomerase RNA subunit, a telomerase-associated protein, and a human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) the maintenance of telomeres supports long-term cellular growth [229]. the challenges for RNA-based therapeutics include an off-target effect, target gene polymorphisms, and ineffective delivery systems to the site of interest [234]. clinical trials with DHEA have been unsuccessful because of the need for high oral doses and the conversion of DHEA into other active forms. PD inhibits G6PD activity and stimulates the generation of cellular ROS by increasing endoplasmic reticulum stress. PD causes cell cycle arrest in the S phase, inducing about 50% apoptosis and inhibiting about 60% invasion. there is no specific G6PD or PPP inhibitors available in clinical trial. ZA inhibits cell proliferation by decreasing the expression of G6PD in bladder cancer cells. stability of TAp73 is decreased in ZA-treated bladder cancer cells through inhibition of Ras activity. this suggests that ZA can inhibit TAp73 stability and decrease G6PD activity via blocking Ras signaling in bladder cancer cells. PD inhibits G6PD activity and stimulates the generation of cellular ROS by increasing endoplasmic reticulum stress. PD causes cell cycle arrest in the S phase, inducing about 50% apoptosis and inhibiting about 60% invasion. there is no specific G6PD or PPP inhibitors available in clinical trial. gene sequences which do not encode proteins with lengths exceeding 200 nucleotides are usually transcribed into long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) lncRNAs play an important role in disease progression. gene sequences which do not encode proteins with lengths exceeding 200 nucleotides are usually transcribed into long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) miR-122 decreases G6PD expression by directly interacting with its 3\u2032UTR as determined by the luciferase reporter assay. miR-1 and miR-122 regulate the PPP by inhibiting G6PD. the use of RNA co-immunoprecipitation reveals that GAS5 interacts with G6PD. this results in inhibition of G6PD and NOX activity. these data suggest that GAS5 could regulate cellular redox balance by directly interacting with G6PD. TERT Regulation Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein with three components. its main function is to insert a telomere repeat sequence at the 3\u2032 end of telomeres. the maintenance of telomeres supports long-term cellular growth. ribonucleoprotein has three components, including a human telomerase RNA subunit, a telomerase-associated protein, and a human telomerase reverse transcriptase. the main function is to insert a telomere repeat sequence at the 3\u2032 end of telomeres [215] the maintenance of telomeres supports long-term cellular growth. the challenges for RNA-based therapeutics include an off-target effect, target gene polymorphisms, and ineffective delivery systems to the site of interest [234]. clinical trials with DHEA have been unsuccessful because of the need for high oral doses. metabolic switch is known as the Warburg effect and is responsible for promoting the synthesis of essential cellular components in rapidly-proliferating cancer cells. the metabolic switch plays an important role in tumor growth, including immune escape, tumor progression, and resistance to chemotherapy. G6PD inhibition induces in vitro and in vivo chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity in AML cells. the metabolic switch is also important in neuronal development, especially in volatile anesthetic-induced neuronal apoptosis. upregulation of the PPP in cancer cells makes it a potential target for cancer therapy. rerouting of glucose to the PPP produces high levels of NADPH to counteract the ROS. increased PPP activity induces high levels of ROS. this is counteracted by an adaptive response that is found with the use of chemotherapeutic agents. cancer cells synergistically enhances the anti-HER2 tyrosine kinase inhibitor-induced cytotoxic effect [26]. the activity and localization of G6PD are regulated by several proteins, including STAT, ID1, p53, BAG3, PAK4, HGF, and AMPK. novel methods of inhibiting the action of G6PD are of great interest in thwarting rapid growth, metastasis, and heterogeneity."}
