CKMB was 9.41 and his first troponin was elevated at 11.54. code heart was called and patient was taken for cardiac catheterization. the gold standard of diagnosis, though not used commonly, is endomyocardial biopsy. it shows a sensitivity of 43-64% and an overall complication rate of 6% with a 0.4% incidence of death due to perforation. a third option involves the use of cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) myocarditis can be fatal and lead to dilated cardiomyopathy and chronic heart failure as well. a better understanding of the pathophysiology and destructive nature of myocarditis through heart muscle destruction and development of dilated cardiomyopathy is important. patients with myocarditis present with several symptoms, clinical and laboratory findings that may coincide with other diagnoses such as ischemia. however, it is vital to keep other conditions in mind as the risk of long-term complications can be detrimental to a patient\u2019s outcome."}
