{"summary": "a 1-year-old castrated male dog was kenneled for 3 weeks with hematochezia. despite initial supportive therapy, clinical signs worsened. owner elected to have the dog euthanized and granted permission for routine necropsy. samples were clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 3 min. supernatants were then filtered and underwent nuclease treatment. library of single-stranded DNA fragments was sequenced by using the Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument. the stem-loop structure was predicted by using Mfold (21). Phylogenetic analysis based on aligned amino acid sequences from full-length replicate (Rep) proteins were generated by using the neighbor-joining method in MEGA4 (22), using amino acid p-distances with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. ISH Analysis A fourth sample cohort consisted of tissue samples from 21 necropsy cases of dogs whose clinical signs or microscopic lesions matched the sentinel animal. a 25-nt oligomer (CTCAGACAGAGACACCGTTGCTATG) complementary to a segment of ORF2 was 3\u2032-end labeled by the addition of a single digoxigen. a manual capillary-action work station (Fisher Scientific) was used to perform colorimetric DNA in situ hybridization. sections were deparaffinized and digested by incubation at 37\u00b0C for 10 min in 0.25% pepsin in 1 Tris-buffered saline. nucleic acid was denatured by 5-min incubation at 105\u00b0C in 100% formamide. a 1-year-old castrated male dog was kenneled for 3 weeks. despite initial supportive therapy, clinical signs worsened. the dog was treated for hypovolemic shock. canine enteric coronavirus, Salmonella spp., canine distemper virus, Campylobacter spp., Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin A gene, and Giardia spp. stains revealed no detectable bacteria or other infectious agents. assembled sequences and singlets >100 bp were compared with the GenBank nonredundant nucleotide and protein databases. potential viral sequences with significant hits (E-value 0.001) to known virus sequences were identified. inverse PCR was then used to amplify the genome of target circoviruses. fecal samples from 204 healthy dogs; fecal samples from 168 dogs with diarrhea; and blood samples from 480 dogs with thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. total nucleic acid was extracted by using the Corbett X-Tractor Gene platform (QIAGEN) control tissues were obtained from 5 dogs whose cause of death was unrelated to vascular disease. a 25-nt oligomer was labeled by the addition of a single digoxigenin-II-dideoxy undine. a manual capillary-action work station was used to perform colorimetric DNA in situ hybridization. sections were incubated in an antidigoxigenin antibody solution (500:1 dilution) containing 2.5 mL buffer 1 with 5 L of antidigoxigenin Fab fragments conjugated with alkaline phosphatase (750 U/mL) sections were then washed and developed according to manufacturer instructions before counterstain with 1% fast-green FCF for 5 min. circoviruses have a circular genome, the full viral genome was amplified by inverse nested PCR and the amplicon sequenced by primer walking. the assembled genome was named DogCV strain UCD1 (DogCV-UCD1) the complete genome of another DogCV strain (DogCV-UCD1) was amplified and sequenced from a fecal sample from a shelter-housed dog that had vomiting and diarrhea. the putative Rep proteins of DogCV-UCD1 showed 42%\u201354% amino acid identity to known circovirus capsids. a phylogenetic analysis of the putative Rep protein of DogCV-UCD1 identified several highly conserved amino acid motifs. the protein was highly basic and arginine-rich as is typical for circoviruses. the partial Rep and/or Cap protein regions (350 bp) were amplified from 11/16 samples. all showed >96% nucleotide identity, except 1 amplicon, which had 90% nucleotide distance to DogCV-UCD1 and -UCD2. blood smear and PCR showed this dog was co-infected with bicavitary hemorrhage. in dogs 1 and 2, the hemorrhage was associated with the gastrointestinal tract. dog 2 had additional multifocal to coalescing regions of hemorrhage. dogs 1 and 3 had multifocal hemorrhage and minimal lymphocytic nephritis. no multinucleate giant cells, common in pigs infected with PCV2, were seen. macrophages in the medullary sinus and lymphatic cords contain abundant DogCV DNA. abundant cytoplasmic viral nucleic acid was detected in macrophages within germinal centers and subcapsular and medullary sinuses of the mesenteric lymph nodes. ileal Peyer\u2019s patches from all 4 dogs were positive in 2 dogs. some inclusions contained paracrystalline arrays of icosahedral virions that were 9\u201311 m in diameter. some inclusions contained paracrystalline arrays of icosahedral virions that were 9\u201311 m in diameter. the 3\u2032-intergenic region of DogCV-UCD1 between the stop codons of the 2 major ORFs was 203 nt (Figure 1, panel A) (27). Phylogenetic analysis of DogCV strains based on the amino acid sequence of the replicate (Rep) protein. the complete genome of another DogCV strain was amplified and sequenced from a fecal sample from a shelter-housed dog that had vomiting and diarrhea. this strain shared 95% overall genome nucleotide identity with DogCV-UCD1 and both strains showed 96%\u201397% nucleotide identity to the recently reported canine circovirus isolate 214 from blood (17). the putative Rep proteins of DogCV-UCD1 showed 42%\u201354% amino acid identity to cal samples from 14/204 healthy dogs and 19/168 dogs with diarrhea were not significant. 13 (68%) were co-infected with >1 other pathogens, including canine enteric coronavirus, Cryptosporidium spp., C. perfringens toxin, Giardia spp., Salmonella spp., Campylobacter jejuni, and Campylobacter coli. samples from the sentinel dog (dog 1) and 3 other dogs (dogs 2\u20134) were positive for DogCV. clinical signs, gross and histologic findings, and distribution of virus DNA as determined by ISH were used to examine a possible causal role. vasculitis was limited to the intestine and spleen, and in dog 3, vasculitis was in kidneys, intestine, heart, liver, spleen, and meninges. all dogs had microscopic lesions in the kidneys, but intensity and character varied widely. peyer\u2019s patches are moderately depleted, and multifocal regions of hemorrhage are present within the muscular intestinal wall. ISH of a Peyer\u2019s patch in the ileum from dog 1 shows moderate depletion of lymphocytes and an increased population of macrophages within the germinal center and the peripheral base of the follicle. rare nuclei of elongate cells (presumed endothelium) lining small vessels of the adrenal cortex or intestinal lamina propria suprajacent to the Peyer\u2019s patches were positive in 2 dogs. none of the 5 control dogs showed DogCV DNA by ISH. a novel circovirus, DogCV, was found in the liver of a dog that had necrotizing vasculitis and granulomatous lymphadenitis. real-time PCR analysis showed a prevalence of 11.3% and 6.9% in fecal samples from dogs with diarrhea and healthy dogs. ISH analysis of the sentinel dog and 21 additional dogs selected retrospectively detected viral nucleic acid in 4 dogs. ISH analysis is similar between DogCV and PCV2. virus distribution in pigs infected with PCV2 is most consistently within lymphoid tissue. sporadic reports of virus in other tissues (4,23,32,33) the role of co-infection in the pathogenesis of disease in these cases is unclear. the role of co-infection in the pathogenesis of disease in these cases is unclear."}
