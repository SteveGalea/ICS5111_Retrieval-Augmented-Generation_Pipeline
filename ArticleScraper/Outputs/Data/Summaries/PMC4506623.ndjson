{"summary": "infant susceptibility to syncytial virus (RSV) lower respiratory tract infection (LRI) during infancy has been consistently associated with an increased risk of childhood asthma. however, the mechanisms through which RSV contributes to asthma development are not understood. in the INSPIRE study, 1952 infants (48% female) were enrolled during the two enrollment years. inSPIRE study will advance understanding of complex causal relationship between RSV infection and early childhood wheezing and asthma."}
