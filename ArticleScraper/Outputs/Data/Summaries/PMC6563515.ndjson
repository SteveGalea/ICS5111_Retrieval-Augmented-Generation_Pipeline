{"summary": "the PDCoV genome is a positive sense single-stranded RNA of approximately 25.4 kb in size. it causes acute diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and mortality in nursing pigs. the PDCoV genome is similar to those of other reported coronaviruses. the gammacoronavirus IBV induced extensive paired membranes and smaller 60-80 nm spherules. a better understanding of the PDCoV life cycle is critically needed to help elucidate the mechanism of virus replication and antiviral activity of the host cells. viral subgenomic RNA (sgRNA) load was monitored by one-step quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) targeting the membrane (M) gene as described previously. qRT-PCR targeted the non-structural protein (nsp) 2 encoding region. phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.0) and 1% Osmium tetroxide (OsO4) in phosphate at 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, and 24 hpi. specimens were dehydrated in ethanol dilutions (30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% and 100%) for 15\u201320 min at each step, then transferred to absolute acetone for 20 min. ultrathin sections were stained by uranyl acetate blots were then incubated with corresponding horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated secondary antibody. virus cultivation was done in a porcine kidney epithelial cell line, LLC-PK1 (ATCC CL-101), at 37 \u00b0C in 5% CO2 in a modified Eagle\u2019s medium. RT-PCR targeting the non-structural protein (nsp) 2 encoding region. nsp2 of ORF1a is expressed by the gRNA. standard curves were performed to allow absolute quantitation of PDCoV RNA copy numbers based on the levels of in vitro transcribed RNAs. ultrathin sections were stained by uranyl acetate and alkaline lead citrate for 5\u201310 min. Western Blot Analysis PDCoV infected LLC-PK1 cells were lysed in CelLytic M lysis buffer (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) the protein concentration was quantified by the BCA protein assay kit (Beyotime Biotechnology, Shanghai, China) infected LLC-PK1 cells produced an infectious titer of 1.25 105 TCID50/mL. by 12 h post infection, infected cells produced an infectious titer of 1.25 105 TCID50/mL. the size of the purified PDCoV virion by ultracentrifugation was first assessed. PDCoV infected cells exhibited significant morphologic changes compared to uninfected controls at 8 hpi. icles (DMVs), zippered endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and injured mitochondria are visible in the cytoplasm. one viral particle is likely in the process of endocytosis at 4 hpi. the process of likely endocytosis of PDCoV was also observed. it is well known that viral gRNA is recognized directly by the host cell machinery. similar events should apply to PDCoV infection as large number of DMVs were seen at 6 hpi and thereafter. vesicles containing mature virions moved to the cell periphery and fuse with the cell membrane. early virions may be released by exocytotic fusion of virus-containing vesicles with plasma membranes without damage to the cell. as viral infection progressed, large amounts of virus particles were released by cytolysis resulting in necrosis of the host cell. the sizes of DMVs ranged from 200 to 400 nm. PDCoV induced a low number of DMVs. most of the DMVs were separate entities or in small clusters in the cytoplasm. PDCoV infection induced autophagosome-like compartments in the cytoplasm of infected LLC-PK1 cells. damages of the mitochondria, showing the disappearance of cristae, could be observed. Irregular mitochondria and mitochondria lacking cristae were observed after PDCoV infection. a series of conjugation reactions converts cytosolic microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-I) to a lipidated form (LC3-II); the ratio of LC3-II is regarded as an accurate indicator of autophagic activity. LC3-II/LC3-I ratio increased significantly from 12\u201324 hpi in PDCoV-infected cells relative to mock-infected cells. this was consistent with the increase in autophagosomes observed in infected cells from 12\u201318 hpi under EM. p62 to -actin from three independent experiments were expressed as mean standard deviation (SD); ** p 0.01, calculated using Student\u2019s t-test. initial work with MHV showed that although capable of inducing autophagy, it was replication-deficiet in ATG5/ embryonic stem cell lines. similar results were observed in IBV infection, where induction or inhibition of autophagy did not affect replication. 107 copies/106 cells reached a final titer of 4.47 108 copies/106 cells at 12 hpi. extracellular or intracellular viral sgRNA amount gradually increased from 5 hpi. by 12 h post infection, infected LLC-PK1 cells produced an infectious titer of 1.25 105 TCID50/mL. the size of the purified PDCoV virion by ultracentrifugation was first assessed. PDCoV infected cells exhibited significant morphologic changes (Figure 2A,B) compared to uninfected controls (Figure 2C,D) at 8 hpi. one viral particle is likely in the process of endocytosis at 4 hpi. PDCoV virions assembled predominantly in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) nearby DMVs. virions of PDCoV start to assemble in the expanded rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) with irregular shape, as the surface was decorated with ribosomes. virions were also observed in large circular organelles (Figure 2J) PDCoV release was observed via exocytosis and cytolysis. early virions may be released by exocytotic fusion of virus-containing vesicles with plasma membranes without damage to the cell. as viral infection progressed, large amounts of virus particles were released by cytolysis resulting in necrosis of the host cell. a low number of DMVs and most of the DMVs were separate entities or in small clusters in the cytoplasm. most of the DMVs contained few or no fibrous material in the inner vesicles (Figure 2G,H and Figure 3A) PDCoV infection induces zippered ER and the ER curved to form a double-membrane vase-like compartment. damages of the mitochondria, showing the disappearance of cristae, could be observed. PDCoV infection induces autophagosome-like vesicles. a series of conjugation reactions converts cytosolic microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3-I) to a lipidated form (LC3-II); the ratio of LC3-II/LC3-I is considered an accurate indicator of autophagic activity. the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio increased significantly from 12\u201324 hpi in PDCoV-infected cells. this was consistent with the increase in autophagosomes observed in infected cells from 12\u201318 hpi under EM. PDCoV infection increased degradation of p62 in LLC-PK1 cells starting at 18 hpi. initial work with MHV showed that although capable of inducing autophagy, it was replication-deficiet in ATG5/ embryonic stem cell lines. this replication deficiency reversed in the presence of an ATG5-expressing plasmid [29], but other studies showed that MHV and SARS-CoV replication does not require an intact autophagy pathway."}
