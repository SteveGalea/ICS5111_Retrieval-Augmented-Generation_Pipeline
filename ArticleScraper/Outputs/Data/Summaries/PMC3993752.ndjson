{"summary": "herpesviruses are divided into alpha, beta, and gamma classes typified by the human herpesviruses herpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and EBV. lytic infection involves expression of approximately 80 (HSV-1 and EBV) to 200 (CMV) proteins that function to manipulate cellular processes. ICP27 of HSV-1 was shown to be required for G1 arrest and to reduce cyclin D1 and Cdk4 levels in conjunction with ICP4 and Vhs (15) the mechanism remains uncharacterized (4, 16, 17) in addition, the IE2 protein induces a G1 arrest by interacting with and stabilizing p53 (18\u201320) Fucci cells are HeLa cells that express two fluorescently labeled probes. truncated version of Cdt1 tagged with monomeric Kusabira orange. truncated version of geminin tagged with monomeric Azami green (mAG) Fucci cells are HeLa cells stably transformed with fluorescently tagged Cdt1 (mKO2-hCDT1) and geminin (mAG-hGem) as previously described. p53-null, human non-small cell lung carcinoma cell line (30) cultured in RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS. Rabbit primary antibodies against p21 and phosphorylated p53 (on S15) were purchased from Cell Signaling. other primary antibodies used were mouse anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-FLAG (Bethyl Laboratories), and rabbit anti-GMIP (ab133975; Abcam) ted with primary antibody (in 5% BSA in PBS) against FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich), NEK9, or GMIP and a corresponding Alexa Fluor-conjugated secondary antibody for 1 h. coverslips were mounted onto slides with a ProLong Gold antifade mounting medium (Invitrogen) images were acquired using a leica DM IRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope. KO2-hCDT1) and geminin (mAG-hGem) were excited using a 488-nm laser. fluorescent signals were collected at 585 nm (585/42-nm BP filter, FL2) and 530 nm (530/30-nm BP filter, FL1) the data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) cells were fixed, permeabilized, and blocked as described above. cells were then incubated with mouse anti-BrdU-FITC and rabbit anti-FLAG primary antibodies for 1 h followed by incubation with goat-anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody for 45 min. samples were then sorted based on expression of the FLAG epitope. RNA was collected from transfected cells using the TRIzol reagent. cDNA was diluted 1:10 and then combined with LightCycler 480 DNA SYBR green I master mix (Roche; catalog no. 04707516001) p21 transcript levels determined after transfection with pMZS3F-BGLF2 were expressed as fold change over those determined after transfection with the pMZS3F empty vector. five 15-cm dishes of CNE2Z cells were transfected with pMZS3F, pMZS3F-LacZ, or pMZS3F-BGLF2 and, 24 h later, were harvested and pooled. a modified UniProt/Swiss-Prot protein database FASTA file was submitted for database searching using X! TANDEM (version 2007.07.01.3) and TPP (version 4.3) search parameters were set to allow for two missed cleavage sites, variable modification by methionine oxidation, and one fixed modification by cysteine carbamidomethylation. Fucci cells were cultured in modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) CNE2Z is a human EBV-negative nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line (29). media for all cells were also supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (100 IU/ml) mouse antibodies against p53 and rabbit antibody against E2F-associated phosphoprotein (EAPP) were from Santa-Cruz Biotechnology. other primary antibodies used were mouse anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma-Aldrich), rabbit anti-FLAG (Bethyl Laboratories) and rabbit anti-GMIP (ab133975; Abcam) images were acquired using a leica DM IRE2 inverted fluorescence microscope. mKO2-Cdt1 and mAG-geminin fluorescent expression was detected using Tx2 (560/40-nm band-pass [BP] and yellow fluorescent protein (YFP; 500/20-nm BP) filter cubes. samples were initially sorted on the expression of the FLAG epitope. then Cdt1 (G1), geminin (S/G2/M), or both (G1/S) were gated. the data were analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star) samples were incubated with mouse anti-BrdU-FITC and rabbit anti-FLAG primary antibodies for 1 h followed by incubation with goat-anti rabbit Alexa Fluor 647 secondary antibody for 45 min. samples were initially sorted based on expression of the FLAG epitope. then gated based on PI stain or BrdU stain in FLAG-positive and FLAG-negative populations. samples were lysed, and IPs were performed as described by Salsman et al. (31) using 20 l (bed volume) of mouse anti-FLAG resin (Sigma-Aldrich) with 1 mg of cell lysate diluted to 6 mg/ml with lysis buffer. p21 transcript levels determined after transfection with pMZS3F-BGLF2 were expressed as fold change. five 15-cm dishes of CNE2Z cells were transfected with pMZS3F, pMZS3F-LacZ, or pMZS3F-BGLF2 (20 g per plate) cells were lysed and immunoprecipitations were performed with anti-FLAG resin as in reference 31. search parameters were set to allow for two missed cleavage sites, variable modification by methionine oxidation, and one fixed modification by cysteine carbamidomethylation. a 10-ppm filter was used for peptide identification. cells were seeded into 6-cm tissue culture dishes at 50% confluence. Fucci cells express red (mKO2)-tagged Cdt1 in G1 and green (monomeric Azami green [mAG])-tagged geminin in S/G2/M. expression of the two tagged proteins overlaps at G1/S. cells were transfected with individual plasmids from the library. mKO2 (G1 cells; red), mAG (S/G2/M cells; green) and FLAG (blue) were stained for the FLAG tag on BORF1. cells were sorted into FLAG-positive and FLAG-negative cells by FACS. cell cycle stages determined from FACS analysis were quantified for FLAG-positive and FLAG-negative cells. the 1.8-fold cutoff was chosen to limit further analyses to 20% of the screened proteins with the strongest effects. many of the functionally characterized proteins that increased G1/S 1.8-fold or more could be categorized as early, tegument, or capsid/capsid assembly proteins. results with individual proteins that increase G1/S are shown in Table 1. early gene Inhibits apoptosis 2.0 0.13 BYRF1 Cytoplasmic Uncharacterized Unknown 2.0 0.28 BSRF1 Subcytoplasmic Tegument Cytoplasmic egress facilitator 1 2.0 0.17 BGLF2 Pancellular Tegument Unknown 2.0 0.33 BDRF1 Nuclear Capsid assembly Proteinase/scaffold protein 2.0 0.36 BCRF1 Subcytoplasmic Early gene Immunomodulation, viral interleukin 10 (IL- in Fucci cells Protein name Subcellular localization Category Function Fold increase SD UL56 Nuclear Uncharacterized Unknown but reduces virulence 2.1 0.22 UL24 Nuclear Tegument Localization of viral glycoproteins 2.1 0.19 ICP35 Pancellular Capsid assembly Protease, interacts with major capsid protein (VP5) 2.0 0.10 ORF O Cytoplasmic Uncharacterized Related to ORFP, antisense to 34.5 2.0 0.13 UL26 Nuclear Capsid assembly M the BDLF1 capsid protein was expressed only in a very small proportion of cells. we expressed the seven FLAG-tagged EBV proteins (by transient transfection) in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cell line that is biologically relevant for EBV because EBV infection induces this cancer. five of the seven EBV proteins analyzed above have homologues in HSV-1 and CMV. for each of the five EBV proteins, at least 1 homologue in HSV-1 or CMV also caused an increase in G1/S cells, suggesting a conservation of the cell cycle function. p53 plays an integral role in eliciting a G1/S arrest. manipulation of p53 and p21 is an important part of the mechanisms by which herpesviruses elicit cell cycle arrest (1). p53 (B) and p21 (C) levels from CNE2Z cells treated with etoposide are shown as a positive control for p53 activation. BGLF2 induces p21 expression independently of p53 activation. BGLF2 induces p21 protein levels in a p53-independent manner. cells were transfected with pMZS3F or pMZS3F-BGLF2. lysates were analyzed by Western blotting for p53, phosphorylated p53 and p21. proteins recovered with BGLF2 were compared to those recovered on anti-FLAG resin from cells containing the empty plasmid (pMZS3F) or pMZS3F-expressing LacZ. GMIP is a member of the ARHGAP family of Rho/Rac/Cdc42-like GTPase-activating proteins, which specifically stimulate the GTPase activity of RhoA. BGLF2 cells transfected with pMZS3F or pMZS3F-BGLF2 were subjected to FLAG immunoprecipitation, followed by Western blotting for NEK9, GMIP, and FLAG. input samples prior to IP are also shown (5% of lysate used for immunoprecipitation) the results confirm the mass spectrometry data that BGLF2 interacts with NEK9 and GMIP. NEK9 and GMIP regulate p21 and are required for BGLF2 to induce p21. BGLF2 could induce p21 in the absence of NEK9 or GMIP. BGLF2 induces p21 by altering the functions of NEK9 and GMIP. cells were treated with siRNA against NEK9 or GMIP or negative-control siRNA (AllStars) cell lysates were then analyzed by Western blotting using the indicated antibodies. to identify cells in the G1/S phase, red and green layers for each image were overlaid, giving rise to cells expressing orange to yellow fluorescence. effects of each expression plasmid on the cell cycle phases were quantified using flow cytometry. cells were stained with anti-FLAG antibody and sorted into FLAG-positive and FLAG-negative populations, which were then analyzed for red (G1), green (S/G2/M), and yellow/orange (G1/S) cells were transfected with plasmids expressing FLAG-tagged BORF1 (A) or BGLF2 (B) and, 24 h later, were either pulse labeled with BrdU (top) or harvested directly and stained with propidium iodide (PI) cells were sorted into FLAG-positive and FLAG-negative cells by FACS and then analyzed for BrdU (S phase) and PI (DNA content) in the top panels. results with individual EBV, HSV-1, and CMV proteins that increase G1/S are shown in Tables 2, 3 and 4 respectively. results with individual EBV proteins that increase G1/S in Fucci cells Virus No. of proteins examined No. of proteins with G1/S change (1.8 fold) BBLF4 Pancellular Replication Helicase-primase ATPase subunit 2.0 0.21 BGLF3 Pancellular Capsid assembly Encapsidation chaperone protein 1.9 0.35 BARF1 Subcytoplasmic Uncharacterized Unknown, herpesvirus UL87 family 1.9 0.14 BDLF4 Pancellular Capsid assembly DNA packaging protein 1.9 0.07 BVRF2 Nuclear Capsid assembly Proteinase/scaffold protein 1.9 0.07 UL32 Cytoplasmic Capsid assembly Capsid transport to replication compartments 1.9 0.21 UL20.5 Nuclear Uncharacterized Unknown 1.9 0.35 ICP34.5 Pancellular Tegument Neurovirulence factor, immunomodulation 1.9 0.28 UL52 Cytoplasmic Replication Part of helicase-primase complex 1.8 0.19 UL8.5 Nuclear Uncharacterized Unknown 1.8 0.29 TABLE 4 CMV proteins that increase G1/S in Fu the BGLF4 kinase tegument protein was not studied further. we expressed the seven FLAG-tagged EBV proteins (by transfection) in CNE2Z cells. the cells were stained with anti-FLAG antibody and propidium iodide. the cellular DNA content of the FLAG-positive and FLAG-negative cells was analyzed by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) we compared the effects of the available homologues in the colorimetric assay in Fucci cells. for each of the five EBV proteins, at least 1 homologue in HSV-1 or CMV also caused an increase in G1/S cells. this suggests a conservation of the cell cycle function. two EBV proteins consistently induced p53 levels, BMRF1 and BORF2, both of which are early proteins involved in DNA replication (Fig. 3A and B). however, neither of these proteins induced p21 above the pMZ3F negative control. BGLF2 induces p21 protein levels in a p53-independent manner. p21 expression levels were increased when cells contained the BGLF2 expression plasmid relative to the empty plasmid control. expression of E2F-associated phosphoprotein (EAPP) is important for activating p21 transcription. 1299 p53-null cells were transfected as described for panel A. lysates were Western blotted for p21 (B) or EAPP (C) in addition to FLAG-BGLF2 and actin. p21 levels were determined by quantitative PCR and normalized to GAPDH. GMIP is a member of the ARHGAP family of Rho/Rac/Cdc42-like GTPase-activating proteins. GMIP is a member of the ARHGAP family of Rho/Rac/Cdc42-like GTPase-activating proteins. a direct role for GMIP during G1/S progression has not been established. interactions of BGLF2 with NEK9 and GMIP were confirmed by FLAG immunoprecipitation of BGLF2 from CNE2Z extracts. in contrast, NEK9 and GMIP were not recovered in FLAG immunoprecipitations performed with CNE2Z extracts containing pMZS3F or pMZS3F-LacZ. we also examined the effect of BGLF2 on the localization of NEK9 treatment of NEK9 or GMIP greatly induced p21 levels. we then asked whether BGLF2 could induce p21 in the absence of NEK9 and GMIP. we then asked whether BGLF2 could induce p21 in the absence of NEK9 and GMIP. siRNA targeted to NEK9 or GMIP or with AllStars negative-control siRNA were transfected with pMZS3F or pMZS3F-BGLF2. only a small proportion of the encoded proteins have been studied for cell cycle effects. we screened a library of over 200 proteins for the ability to increase the proportion of cells in G1/S, using the HeLa Fucci cell line. UL69 induces G1/S accumulation, which is indistinguishable from G1 based on DNA content analysis. the other protein identified in our screen was UL76, which has been reported to have a variety of functions, including induction of cell cycle arrest. several RNA viruses, including flaviviruses, togaviruses, and coronaviruses, use their capsid proteins to inhibit apoptosis and innate antiviral responses. coronavirus nucleocapsid protein has been shown to inhibit S phase progression by modulating cyclin-CDK activity (55) BMRF1 and BORF2 were found to induce total and Ser15-phosphorylated p53. despite inducing p53, both proteins failed to induce p53 target gene p21. this suggests they disable downstream functions of p53. BGLF2 increased p21 levels without inducing the level or phosphorylation of p53. experiments in p53-null cells showed that p53 was not required for BGLF2 to induce p21. p21 can be stabilized by changes to its phosphorylation state or by protein interactions. NEK9 is a protein kinase that has multiple effects on the cell cycle. downregulation of NEK9 by RNA interference has been found to slow the progression from G1 phase to S phase. p21 regulation was not accompanied by p53 induction, suggesting that the p21 regulation is p53 independent."}
