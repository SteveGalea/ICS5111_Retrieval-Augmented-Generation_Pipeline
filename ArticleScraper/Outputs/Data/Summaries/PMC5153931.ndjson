{"summary": "a joint team from WHO and ministries of health conducted 4\u20135 day missions to Bangladesh, Bhutan, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste. each country\u2019s Ebola virus disease preparedness on 41 tasks under nine key components adapted from the WHO Ebola preparedness checklist of January 2015. the framework for the assessment were the key components and tasks proposed as indicators in the WHO consolidated Ebola preparedness checklist issued in January 2015. a series of 4\u20135 day missions were undertaken to each country by a joint assessment team comprising staff from WHO and the respective ministry of health. component comprised several tasks or activities (total 41) each task addressed one of the three aspects of preparedness. what activities are currently operational for handling the threat of Ebola virus disease (currently functional activities); how prepared the country is for the introduction of an Ebola virus disease case (operational readiness); and how prepared the country is to face a wider outbreak of Ebola virus (surge capacity; Table 1). Ebola task force or Ebola committee established and operational Operational readiness Not mentioned Strategies briefly mentioned Multilevel and multisectoral approach established Detailed strategies identified C2.

Communication (dissemination mechanism, public information, social mobilization and risk communication) H1. Communication coordination mechanism functional, involving all government sectors and other stakeholders Operational readiness No Plan or strategy developed (centralized, different audience, partnership, partnership) Experienced team or unit in place, with clear roles and responsibilities for Ebola risk communication materials Training provided with simulation Currently functional activities No Procedures in place Training provided Procedures reviewed or tested I5. Communication procedures in place between health and airport authorities Currently functional activities No Planned, with detailed mechanism described In place Monitoring system tested with at-risk travellers. high surge capacity was defined as evidence of surge planning in terms of sufficient enrolment of trained staff and adequate space and supplies. the WHO Ethical Research Committee reviewed the programme methods and concluded that the activity did not qualify as research with human subjects. only seven of the countries had developed a specific, written Ebola virus disease preparedness plan (task A1) risk assessment was conducted in six countries (Bhutan, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Timor-Leste) only Sri Lanka and Thailand used risk assessment for preparedness by identifying several scenarios of Ebola virus disease to be addressed in the preparedness process. all ministries of health had such a centre handled by the ministry\u2019s disaster management department (task C4). Sri Lanka and Thailand fully satisfied the effectiveness criteria of an early warning system (task D1) and capacity to identify potential incubating travellers. most countries use an Internet-based system to report diseases. only Bangladesh, Indonesia and Thailand had developed a molecular technique. all three had identified suspected Ebola virus disease cases in the past year. others had stand-by arrangements with a courier company. only Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand showed evidence of operational readiness to isolate and manage a suspected or confirmed Ebola virus disease case. many of the visited hospitals had primarily developed a system for separating referred suspected Ebola virus patients from other patients. airport staff should identify international travellers exhibiting signs and symptoms of Ebola virus disease and provide a coordinated response on arrival. some airports were not up to standard or poorly equipped (e.g. without an isolation or holding-area facility) there was close collaboration between the airport authorities and the health authorities in all countries. five countries expressed difficulties in releasing funds dedicated to preparedness activities, two of which struggled with major bottlenecks in funding. only Bhutan, Maldives and Thailand had introduced hazard pay for health and non-health professionals in high-risk assignments. Bangladesh and Nepal reported no special plan for staff motivation or compensation for high-risk assignments. a technical subcommittee was set up to develop and implement the Ebola virus disease preparedness plan (task C3) countries had different understandings of the functions of an emergency operating centre. the potential to use such a centre as a centre for data management and analysis was often overlooked. a country\u2019s surveillance/epidemiology unit should coordinate the 21-day follow-up of at-risk travellers returning from affected countries. all countries had at least one national reference laboratory. Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nepal and Thailand possessed a biosafety level 3 facility. some countries (Bhutan, Sri Lanka and Thailand) had developed a more cost\u2013effective approach. training would be rolled out to subnational rapid response teams. smaller countries (Bhutan, Maldives and Timor-Leste) reported issues. all but two countries acknowledged having limited clinical expertise for managing an Ebola virus disease case. most infectious disease physicians had self-trained using WHO and other international institutions\u2019 clinical management guidelines. communication to travellers is paramount so that any at-risk travellers can report to the health authorities for medical screening and a 21-day follow-up. the situation may increase the risk of a traveller with incubating Ebola virus entering the country and not reporting voluntarily. most countries had deficiencies in this area, and recognized difficulties in developing their risk communication strategic and action plan. only Indonesia and Thailand had experience in handling a highly contagious disease. most acknowledged that a timely and sensitive early warning system was difficult to achieve. countries need to be prepared for a scenario that rapidly overwhelms the capacity of health authorities. they should consider detailed surge capacity planning that includes stand-by arrangements with other ministries (e.g. defence or interior) transparency and consensus were adopted by WHO\u2019s joint external evaluation in 2016 to monitor IHR compliance. study provides a general picture of comparative strengths and weaknesses across various aspects of Ebola disease preparedness. further strengthening of IHR capacities must involve testing the functionality of preparedness and response systems."}
