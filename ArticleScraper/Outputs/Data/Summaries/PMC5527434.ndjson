{"summary": "1,936 laboratory-confirmed MERS-CoV cases, including 690 deaths, were reported from 27 countries. the WHO has recommended molecular detection of MERS-CoV based on real-time reverse transcription-PCR (rRT-PCR) targeting of the genomic regions upstream of the E protein gene (upE) and open reading frame 1a. RNA extraction was performed with an r gene RNA internal control using the MagNA Pure 96 RNA extraction kit (Roche, Switzerland), and 50-l elution volumes were collected. the in-house assay was additionally performed for confirmation. -house assaya MERS-CoV r-gene rRT-PCR specimen No. of positive results/total no. of tests (%) PPA (95% CI) NPA (95% CI) OPA (95% CI) MERS-CoV-negative cases Upper respiratory tract OPSs (n = 28)b 9/9 (100) 0/19 (0) 100.0 (70.1\u2013100.0) 100.0 (83.2\u2013100.0) 100.0 (87.9\u2013100.0 the r gene rRT-PCR assay is comparable to the in-house rRT-PCR assay for a large number of patient specimens. the r gene rRT-PCR assay is a reliable method to detect MERS-CoV."}
