{"summary": "coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 causes moderate hepatitis and mild encephalitis, followed by chronic demyelinating disease. a59 is cleared from the liver and central nervous system (CNS) primarily by the T cell response 7 to 10 days postinfection (4, 5) however, type I interferon production, an early innate immune response, is crucial for early control of MHV infection. IFN signaling through the interferon receptor (IFNAR1) (4) stimulates the expression of ISGs (5 and 6). 2-5A binds to RNase L, inducing its dimerization and subsequent activation. many viruses encode proteins that inhibit this pathway to various extents. ns2H126R expressing an inactive PDE fails to effectively antagonize RNase L and consequently is attenuated for replication in myeloid cells and in the livers of mice (25). constitutive, low-level type I IFN production in the absence of infection maintains basal levels of expression of ISGs. Nase L activation does not require IFN induction during virus infection of macrophages. myeloid cells activate RNase L early during infection. thereby limit viral spread to other cell types. RNA was isolated with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase (qRT)-PCR was performed as described previously (2). 200 ng (cells) or 350 ng (tissue) of total RNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase (Superscript III; Invitrogen) marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) were generated from the hind limbs of WT mice as described previously (40, 41) and cultured in RPMI 1640 (Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50 M -mercaptoethanol, and 20 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony- mixed glial cultures, consisting of astrocytes and microglia, were generated from the brains of 1- to 3-day-old neonatal mice. tissue was dissociated by mechanical disruption through a 70-m nylon mesh filter. cells were lifted from their culture vessel using enzyme-free Hanks' balanced salt solution-based cell disassociation buffer (Gibco) BMM cultures were treated with 0, 2, or 5 g/ml of IFNAR1-blocking monoclonal antibody (MAb) or an isotype control. supernatants recovered from cells that were infected with MHV strains were exposed to 600 mJ cm2 UVA light in a Stratalinker 1800 (Stratagene) total RNA from virus-infected cells was quantified with a commercial capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit. total RNA from virus-infected cells was isolated using an RNeasy kit (Qiagen) and quantified using a nanodrop analyzer. RNA integrity numbers (referred to as RIN values) are indicated. mouse RNase L (rabbit polyclonal; 1:1,000) (46), human RNase L (mouse monoclonal against human RNase L; 1:1,000) (11), as well as anti-GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase)-horseradish peroxidase (HRP); goat anti-mouse IgG-HRP (Santa Cruz; 1:5,000), donkey anti incubated with L2 mice fibroblasts for 24 h, followed by infection with NDV-GFP. at 12 or 24 h postinfection, the cells were fixed and examined for EGFP expression by microscopy. RNA was extracted from uninfected WT and Ifih1/ BMM cultures at 9 and 12 h postinfection. rRNA degradation was assessed with a bioanalyzer. the data are pooled from two independent experiments performed in triplicate. mRNA expression levels relative to -actin mRNA are expressed as 2CT, where CT is equal to CT Target Gene minus CT -actin. the data are pooled from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate, and are shown as means and SEM. mRNA expression levels relative to -actin mRNA are expressed as 2CT, where CT is equal to CT Target Gene minus CT -actin. the dashed line indicates the lower limit of detection. rRNA degradation was assessed with a bioanalyzer. BMM and astrocyte lysates were electrophoresed on the same gel and blot. intervening lanes were removed and replaced by spaces between samples. proteins were extracted from human A549 and murine 3T3/pLZ cells. cells were transfected with 10 M 2-5A in Lipofectamine or with Lipofectamine alone. rRNA degradation was assessed with a bioanalyzer. 28S and 18S rRNAs are indicated. a linear least-squares regression model was used to determine fluorescence intensities corrected for cell size and cell shape. recombinant coronaviruses inf-MHV-A59 and inf-ns2-H126R were obtained from Stuart Siddell (University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom) RNA was isolated with an RNeasy minikit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) qRT-PCR was performed as described previously (2). cDNA was reverse transcribed into cDNA using reverse transcriptase. cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS, 2 mM l-glutamine, 1% penicillin-streptomycin, 50 M -mercaptoethanol, and 20 ng/ml of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cells were fed on days 3, 6, and 8 with fresh medium and supplements. neuron cultures were routinely 95 to 98% pure, as determined by positive immunostaining for MAP2 and negative immunostaining for CD11b (microglia-specific marker), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and OLIG2 (oligodendrocyte-specific marker) (42) mixed glial cultures, consisting of astrocytes and microglia, were generated from the brains of 1- to 3-day-old neonatal mice. the cells were transfected with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-purified 10 M 2-5A (p3A3) in 3 g/ml Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) or Lipofectamine alone, and 4 h later, the cell lysates were harvested and RNA was isolated. supernatants recovered from cells that were infected with MHV strains at an MOI of 1 PFU/cell. saline (Gibco) containing 4% paraformaldehyde examined for enhanced-GFP expression under an Eclipse TE2000-U fluorescence microscope. images acquired using NIS-Elements Basic Research microscope imaging software (Nikon Instruments, Inc.) vinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membranes were blocked with 5% nonfat milk. blots were probed sequentially with antibodies directed against OAS1A, OAS2, OAS3, and GAPDH. blots were stripped between antibody treatments. Ifih1/ macrophages were either mock infected or infected with A59 or ns2H126R (1 PFU/cell) at 12 h postinfection, the supernatants were treated with UV light to inactivate the virus. at 12 h postinfection, the cells were fixed and examined for EGFP expression by microscopy. mRNA expression levels relative to -actin mRNA are expressed as 2CT, where CT is equal to CT Target Gene minus CT -actin. the data are pooled from two independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. the data are shown as means and SEM. the data are pooled from three independent experiments, each performed in triplicate. microglia (GFAP CD11b+ F4/80+) and macrophages (GFAP CD11b+ F4/80+) were assessed for surface expression of IFNAR1. the data are from one representative experiment of two, each performed in triplicate. overexpression of RNase L is not sufficient to overcome low OAS levels to promote RNase L degradation. proteins were extracted from human A549 and murine 3T3/pLZ cells. mRNA expression levels relative to -actin mRNA are expressed as 2CT. 3T3/pLZ and 3T3/neo cells were mock infected or infected with A59 or ns2H126R (1 PFU/cell), and at 12 h postinfection, the cells were lysed and RNA was extracted. rRNA degradation was assessed with a bioanalyzer. IFNAR1 (Biolegend; clone MAR1-5A3) or an isotype control (clone MOPC-21) fluorescence intensity, dependent on both surface IFNAR1 density and cell surface area, was normalized by cell size using previously described methods (47). we compared the replication of A59 and ns2H126R in BMM and BMDC. BMDC restricted mutant-virus replication by 100-fold at 12 h (P 0.01) and 1,000-fold after 24 h postinfection (P 0.001) 2H126R induced rRNA cleavage at 9 and 12 h postinfection. BMDC behaved similarly to BMM in activation of RNase L. restriction of mutant virus and activation of RNase L correlated with elevated basal levels of OAS genes. human RNase L was previously demonstrated to be activated in 3T3/pLZ cells when exposed to 2-5A (33) however, the 3T3/pLZ cells and control 3T3/neo cells lacking the human RNase L gene expressed a relatively low level of Oas mRNA, similar to that of the murine L2 cell line (29) both A59- and ns2H126R-infected WT BMM secreted detectable antiviral activity at 12 and 24 h postinfection (29), while infected MDA5-deficient (Ifih1/) BMM failed to secrete detectable levels. these immunoblot data show a small to modest increase in OAS1A, OAS2, and RNase L levels in Ifih1/ cells compared to the WT. however, other replicates failed to show any detectable differences. compared the levels of other ISGs in WT and Ifih1/ BMM. BMM found reduced expression of Oas1a (P 0.01), Oas2 (P 0.001), and Oas3 (P 0.01) mRNAs in Ifnar1/ BMM. presumably due to loss of basal IFN signaling, but no significant difference in Rnasel mRNA expression. we hypothesized that the difference in basal ISG expression between macrophages and astrocytes could be due to the cell surface expression level of the type I interferon receptor, IFNAR1. cells with higher IFNAR1 surface expression might promote higher basal IFN signaling and ISG levels. astrocytes displayed larger range in size than macrophages. we used a monoclonal antibody (MAR1-5A3) specific for the IFNAR1 subunit of the murine IFN receptor that blocks ligand-induced intracellular receptor signaling and induction of ISGs. after 1 h of 2-g/ml antibody pretreatment of WT BMM, there was no increase in Oas1, Oas2, or Oas3 mRNA expression following infection. the basal levels of mRNAs in mock-infected cells treatment of cells with an isotype control antibody had no effect on replication of A59 or ns2H126R. the replication of ns2H126R was restricted following treatment with isotype control antibody. activation of RNase L correlated with an Oas gene basal level of expression and did not require further upregulation during infection. titers of supernatants from ns2H126R-infected BMM cultures pretreated with no MAb (D), 2 g/ml IFNAR1-blocking MAb (solid lines) or istoype control Ab (dotted lines) (E), and 5 g/ml of IFNAR1 blocking MAb (solid lines) or istotype control Ab (dotted lines) were determined by plaque assay. s2H126R in primary cell types was as robust as that of A59 (2, 25, 29) we compared the replication of A59 and ns2H126R in BMM and BMDC derived from B6 (WT) mice. BMDC restricted mutant-virus replication by 100-fold at 12 h (P 0.01). mutant virus ns2H126R induced rRNA cleavage at 9 and 12 h postinfection in BMM and BMDC. in contrast, A59 did not induce rRNA cleavage, similar to mock-infected cells. BMDC behaved similarly to BMM in activation of RNase L. 3T3 cell line (3T3/pLZ) stably overexpresses human RNase L from a cytomegalovirus promoter at a level greater than 100-fold that of endogenous murine RNase L cells or endogenous human RNase L in A549 cells. however, the 3T3/pLZ cells and control 3T3/neo cells lacking the human RNase L gene expressed a relatively low level of Oas mRNA. the activation of RNase L occurs only in the same limited cell types (7, 29, 49) both A59- and ns2H126R-infected WT BMM secreted detectable antiviral activity at 12 and 24 h postinfection (29), while infected MDA5-deficient (Ifih1/) BMM failed to secrete detectable levels. these immunoblot data show a small to modest increase in OAS1A, OAS2, and RNase L levels in Ifih1/ cells compared to the WT. other replicates failed to show any detectable differences. compared the levels of other ISGs in WT and Ifih1/ BMM. ns2H126R was fully recovered in Ifnar1/ BMM. we compared expression of several Oas genes in WT and Ifnar1/ BMM. we found reduced expression of Oas1a (P 0.01), Oas2 (P 0.001), and Oas3 (P 0.01) mRNAs. ns2H126R infection induced rRNA degradation. but in Ifnar1/ BMM cultures, RNase L was not activated. the difference in basal ISG expression could be at least partly due to the cell surface expression level of the type I interferon receptor, IFNAR1. we used a monoclonal antibody (MAR1-5A3) specific for the IFNAR1 subunit of the murine IFN receptor that blocks ligand-induced intracellular receptor signaling and induction of ISGs. after 1 h of 2-g/ml antibody pretreatment of WT BMM, there was no increase in Oas1, Oas2, or Oas3 mRNA expression following infection. the basal levels of mRNAs in mock-infected cells treatment of cells with an isotype control antibody had no effect on replication of A59 or ns2H126R. replication of ns2H126R was restricted following treatment with isotype control antibody. activation of RNase L correlated with an Oas gene basal level of expression and did not require further upregulation during infection. the values for mock-infected, 5 g/ml MAb-treated cells are significantly different from those for mock-infected, 0 MAb- or 2 g/ml MAb-treated cells, *, P 0.05. RNA from mock-infected cultures appeared similar to that from A59-infected cells. BMM are prearmed with high basal levels of OAS gene expression. this is especially important when considering a virus like MHV that induces IFN only late in infection. this is especially important when considering a virus like MHV that induces IFN only late in infection. a high level of RNase L could overcome the requirement for high OAS levels to produce 2-5A. MHV induces type I IFN in myeloid cells only and not mouse fibroblast lines. high levels of RNase L were not sufficient to overcome insufficient levels of Oas gene expression. 1/ mice is both necessary and adequate to produce enough 2-5A to activate RNase L in the absence of virus-induced IFN. MHV and other coronaviruses are poor inducers of IFN, as they actively avoid and/or inhibit a robust type I IFN response in infected cells. MHV does induce IFN in macrophages and microglia in the brain (7), as well as pDCs in vivo (17), and in myeloid we infer from these data that, not surprisingly, IFN treatment induces many antiviral ISGs, some of which inhibit viral replication without the activation of RNase L. however, this low level of constitutive IFN is believed to have many important effects for the host, including cytokine induction, immune cell activity, maintenance and mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells. we found that astrocytes have a significantly higher basal Irf2 mRNA expression level than BMM (data not shown) there is some evidence that the IFNAR1 expression level may play a role in viral pathogenesis. it was recently reported that the encephalitic flaviviruses tick-borne encephalitis virus and west Nile virus antagonize IFN signaling. surface expression levels of IFNAR, as well as basal ISG levels, were higher basal expression of OAS1a, OAS2 and OAS3 proteins was dependent on IFNAR expression. levels in myeloid cells were sufficient to activate RNase L upon viral infection."}
