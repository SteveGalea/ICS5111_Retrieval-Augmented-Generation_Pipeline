{"summary": "computerised tomography is a valuable diagnostic tool for identifying pneumomediastinum in patients with subcutaneous emphysema. pneumomediastinum is typically a benign condition, but aggressive management may occasionally be required. evidence regarding use of non-invasive ventilation remains limited but it may theoretically aggravate any air leakage. initial bloods showed a White Blood Cell count of 1.6, C-reactive Protein (CRP) of 320, and an Acute Kidney Injury stage 1 (Creatinine 108, Urea 13.3). a diagnosis of aspiration pneumonia with AKI secondary to sepsis was made. the patient\u2019s initial treatment included intravenous amoxicillin and metronidazole alongside intravenous fluids. the patient\u2019s subcutaneous emphysema descended into his abdominal wall and lower limbs. both invasive and non-invasive ventilation would worsen the clinical situation. the patient died of septic shock on day 9 after admission. stinum cases can be identified by chest x-ray, computed tomography provides confirmation in uncertain cases and clarification of its extent[2]. pneumomediastinum has previously been associated with cases of pneumonia but often with rare strains such as P. jirovecii pneumonia in immunocompromised patients[1]. mechanical ventilation may worsen air leakage and the subsequent pneumomediastinum but may be used with caution. pneumonia is an uncommon cause of pneumomediastinum."}
