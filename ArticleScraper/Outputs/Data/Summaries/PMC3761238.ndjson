{"summary": "the genome comprises a 5' untranslated region (UTR); a 3' UTR; at least seven open reading frames (ORFs) that encode four structural proteins, namely, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N); and three non-structural proteins, namely, replicases 1a and 1ab. the PEDV S protein is a type I glycoprotein composed of 1,383 amino acids (aa) pigs of all ages were affected and exhibited watery diarrhea, dehydration, and thin-walled intestines. pigs of all ages were affected and exhibited mild diarrhea and anorexia. the S protein of the YJ7C strain contained 28 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 22 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated. the S protein of the YJ7C strain contained 29 Asn-Xaa-Ser/Thr sequons and 23 asparagines predicted to be N-glycosylated. strain may influence pathogenicity and antigenicity. strain may influence pathogenicity and antigenicity and should be researched. the highest DNA sequence identity to our PEDV strains was CH8 (one Chinese PEDV strain), which had 98.4% identity. the nucleotide sequence of our PEDV strains had only 93.8% to 93.9% identity to the CV777 vaccine strain. their deduced amino acids had 93.6% to 93.7%

from our study. one mutation (LH at 521) was also found in all the five PEDV strains from our study. however, no mutations were found in the five PEDV strains from our study. the variant strains were detected in this study, implying an identical distribution profile for PEDV on pig farms in Gansu, china. the sequence insertions and deletions in the S gene and mutations in the antigenic regions found in variant strains possibly provided stronger pathogenicity and antigenicity to the new PEDV variants. four (from N to V at 57, from N to I at 127, from T to I at 232, and from N to S at 719) of the changes in the predicted amino acid sequence destroyed N-linked glycosylation sites. another three changes (from S to N at 58, from I to T at 116, and from T to N at 1193) created three new glycosylation sites compared with the vaccine strain CV777. changes in the N-linked glycosylation sites nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence homology results are described in Table 1. the
