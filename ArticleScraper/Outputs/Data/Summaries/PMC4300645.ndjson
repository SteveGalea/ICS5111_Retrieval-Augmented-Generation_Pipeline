{"summary": "infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is the prototype avian coronavirus from the Gammacoronavirus genus. IBV enters the avian host through the respiratory tract. it causes the destruction of the epithelium, leading to respiratory distress and initiation of secondary bacterial infections. the activation of RLRs leads to the transcription of genes encoding type I interferons (IFN- and IFN-) these interferons are secreted from the infected cell, providing a signal for the infected as well as the neighboring cells that induce the transcription of antiviral effector genes. the ability of a virus to replicate and produce infectious progeny depends in large part on its ability to avoid induction or counteract the IFN response of its host. two transcriptional studies on tissues collected after in vivo and in ovo IBV infections found only limited upregulation of ISGs at 1 to 3 days postinfection. functional studies using IBV Beaudette showed that it induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis (26, 27), that IBV interacts with eIF3f (28), and that IBV inhibits protein kinase R activation, thereby maintaining protein synthesis (29). RNA and the induction of Ifn transcription suggest that IBV interferes with the recognition of dsRNA. accessory proteins 3a and 3b are involved in limiting Ifn expression. infection with 3a null virus induced lower IFN levels, whereas a 3b null virus increased IFN production compared to that of the parental virus. trachea were filled with a solution of 3.5 U/ml protease type XIV (Sigma), 4 U/ml DNase I (Qiagen) and 1% PenStrep in Eagle's minimum essential medium (EMEM), sealed with clamps, and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C. cells lining the luminal side of the trachea were flushed with cold EMEM, filtered through a cell strainer. IBV-M41, IBV-QX, IBV-Italy-O2, Rift Valley fever virus clone 13 (RVFV Cl13) and infectious pancreatic necrosis virus (IPNV) were obtained from Merck Animal Health, Boxmeer, The Netherlands. 8 105 CEK cells or 3 105 DF-1 cells were lysed in RLT buffer (Qiagen) at various time points after treatment or infection. luciferase expression later will be used as an external reference gene for normalization during gene expression analysis. the expression of various housekeeping genes was unstable during virus infections at time points later than 24 h (data not shown) no IBV was present in the noninfected cells that were used as the control in all experiments.

RESULTS IBV delays the onset of an IFN response during infection of primary chicken cells. RESULTS IBV delays the onset of an IFN response during infection of primary chicken cells. pattern recognition receptors Mda5 and Tlr3 and the transcription factor Irf3 also upregulated. chicken embryo kidney cells were infected with IBV M41 at an MOI of 0.1. old specific-pathogen-free chickens and DF-1 chicken fibroblast cells were infected with IBV M41 or IBV Beaudette (Beau-R) at several time points after infection, Ifn levels were monitored by RT-qPCR. in both cell types, Ifn transcription followed the same kinetics as those observed in CEK cells. DF-1 cells stimulated with extracellular poly(IC), transfected poly(IC) or dsRNA virus IPNV. stimulation could induce Ifn transcription as early as 1 h after stimulation. DF-1 cells do not respond to stimulation with extracellular dsRNA. CEK cells were infected with IBV M41 (MOI, 1), IBV Beau-R (MOI, 1), Sindbis-GFP (MOI, 1), IPNV (MOI, 50), and RVFV Cl13 (MOI, 5). depicted are Ifn fold changes at 12 hpi relative to uninfected control cells. dsRNA can be recognized by membrane-bound TLR3 and cytosolic RLRs. chickens do not express a RIG-I homologue (52), leaving TLR3 and MDA5 as the two PRRs potentially involved in dsRNA sensing. silencing of Mda5, but not Tlr3, in DF-1 cells resulted in a 70% decrease in Ifn transcription. dsRNA could be detected clearly, even at a low MOI of 0.01, by 12 hpi. dsRNA could be detected as early as 3 h postinfection only in IBV-infected cells. CEK cells were infected with IBV M41 or IBV Beau-R at indicated MOIs. at 12 hpi (A), dsRNA was visualized in M41-infected cells using an antibody against dsRNA. accumulation of dsRNA was visualized at the indicated time postinfection. IBV-infected cells, but not adjacent uninfected cells, upregulate Ifn transcription in response to IBV infection. the significant time lag between accumulation of dsRNA and Ifn transcription further suggests the presence of a mechanism adopted by IBV to circumvent an IFN response. accessory proteins 3a and 3b are involved in regulation of IFN transcription and protein production in CEK cells infected with scAUG3a, scAUG3b, and scAUG3ab mutant viruses. infection with all mutant viruses led to increased transcription of Ifn compared to that of the Beau-R virus. bars represent the means (plus standard deviations) from triplicate wells from a representative experiment. no significant differences in IFN protein production were observed between cells infected with the Beau-R and the scAUG3ab double null virus. IBV infection appears to result in a synergistic activation of the TLR3 pathway triggered by poly(IC) this method induced very little transcription of Ifn in primary CEK cells because of its low transfection efficiency. we investigated the use of either RVFV Cl13 or IPNV, which induce Ifn transcription in CEK cells. DF-1 Ifn-luc reporter cells were infected with IBV M41 (MOI, 10) for 6 h. DF-1 cells were coinfected with IBV M41 (MOI, 5) and RVFV clone 13 (MOI, 5). DF-1 cells were infected with IBV Beau-R (MOI, 1) for 3 h. Ifn levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. bars represent the means (plus standard deviations) from triplicate wells. IFN protein activity levels were quantified using a chicken IFN-specific mx-luc cell-based bioassay showing accumulation of IFN from 36 hpi onwards. a subset of genes involved in innate immunity, including Mx, Oas, and Il8, was upregulated, while others, such as Tlr7, Adar, Isg12, MHC-I, and Ifnar2, appeared not to be affected. the delayed IFN response is independent of the cell type or virus strain. ifn transcription during infection with coronaviruses such as MHV is low (9, 10, 12, 13, 49) and was shown to be dependent on cell type and virus strain (50). DF-1 cells were infected with IBV Beau-R at an MOI of 0.1. intracellular IBV total RNA (open diamonds) and Ifn mRNA (bars) are depicted as fold changes as assessed by RT-qPCR. CEK cells were seeded in 24-well plates and 48 h later they were stimulated with extracellular poly(IC) for the indicated times. DF-1 cells were infected with IPNV, a nonreplicating dsRNA virus. dsRNA has been shown to be the canonical inducer of Ifn. DF-1 cells show only a marginal upregulation of Ifn transcription in response to extracellular dsRNA. dsRNA can be recognized by membrane-bound TLR3 and cytosolic RLRs. silencing of Mda5, but not Tlr3, resulted in a 70% decrease in Ifn transcription. DF-1 cells (B and D) and DF-1 Ifn-luc reporter cells (C) were transfected with siRNAs. dsRNA (B), Ifn-luciferase activity (C) and IBV titers and intracellular RNA (D) were analyzed 18 hpi. dsRNA could be detected clearly, even at a low MOI of 0.01, by 12 hpi. dsRNA could be detected as early as 3 h postinfection only in IBV-infected cells. dsRNA starts accumulating very early in IBV-infected cells. IBV M41 infects only 70% of cells, indicating that not all cells are permissive to IBV M41 infection. we used RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization to visualize Ifn mRNA in CEK cells. at 12 hpi and low MOI, none of the IBV-infected cells displayed an accumulation of Ifn mRNA. infection with the scAUG3ab but not the scAUG5ab null virus resulted in increased upregulation of Ifn expression. the difference in Ifn transcription between the scAUG3ab and the parental (Beau-R) virus could not be ascribed to differences in kinetics of virus replication. accessory proteins 3a and 3b are involved in regulation of IFN transcription and protein production. CEK cells were infected with scAUG3a, scAUG3b, or scAUG3ab null IBV virus (MOI, 0.1) nonself dsRNA remains intact in IBV-infected cells. we investigated the ability of IBV to interfere with the sensing of nonself dsRNA by TLR3 or MDA5. we infected CEK cells with IBV M41 and subsequently used extracellular poly(IC) to trigger TLR3 signaling. IPNV is a birnavirus with a dsRNA genome that naturally infects salmonids. the PRR responsible for sensing IPNV dsRNA has not been described. DF-1 Ifn-luc reporter cells were transfected with siRNAs against Tlr3 and Mda5. CEK cells were coinfected with IBV M41 (MOI, 10) for 6 h and superinfected with IPNV or UV-inactivated IPNV (MOI, 50) for an additional 6 h. DF-1 cells were infected with IBV Beau-R (MOI, 1) for 3 h. we performed a comprehensive analysis of the kinetics of IBV infection in avian cells. we studied the mechanisms by which IBV interferes with the onset of the type I IFN response. this study provides the most comprehensive analysis of the interplay between a Gammacoronavirus and the avian type I IFN response. the analysis of the chicken genome suggests that chicken lack a RIG-I homologue (52), and basal expression of Tlr7 was found to be very low in CEK cells. the analysis of the chicken genome suggests that chicken lack a RIG-I homologue (52), and basal expression of Tlr7 was found to be very low in CEK cells. the silencing of Mda5 did not lead to an increase in the replication of IBV. the presence of coronavirus-induced DMVs has been demonstrated as early as 2 hpi in SARS-CoV-infected cells. however, the timing of DMV formation suggests that membrane rearrangements play a role in the delayed activation of the IFN response by shielding dsRNA from cellular PRRs. infection with the 3b null virus resulted in increased IFN production. infection with the 3a null virus resulted in reduced IFN levels. accessory proteins 3a and 3b antagonize each other to tightly regulate IFN production. a motif analysis for IBV 3a protein did not reveal the presence of relevant motives that might explain the observed activity of 3a on IFN regulation. the fact that 3a seems to promote IFN production indicates that CoVs tightly regulate IFN production to balance their own survival with that of the host. we show that the Gammacoronavirus IBV induces activation of the type I IFN response in primary chicken renal cells, tracheal epithelial cells, and a chicken cell line. the activation of the IFN response is dependent on MDA5."}
