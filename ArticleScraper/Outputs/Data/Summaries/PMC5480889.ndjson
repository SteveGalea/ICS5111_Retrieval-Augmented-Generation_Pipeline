Lay press sources were searched using the same parameters as for the academic press. the top magazines, newspapers, and online blogs were searched using the same parameters as for the academic press. the EVD page was downloaded on the same date that blog and newspaper searchers were performed. potential covariates were documented such as date of publication, copy length, author\u2019s nation of origin, total pages, impact factor, readership, number of authors, and citations. overt errors were statements that were simply untrue, such as claims that the outbreak began in March of 2014 instead of December 2013 [86]. caveated inaccuracies were those presenting inaccurate statements as uncertainty. such qualifiers placed in front of discussion of airborne transmission could suggest doubt. a consensus narrative could be constructed for the EVD outbreak. this narrative should not serve as a historical source document. the resultant scores for comprehensive review articles were generated using the CERC model. pregnant females (abortion, placenta previa) Adults over 45 Health workers Breastfeeding infants Mucosal-to-body fluid contact Consumption of bush meat (rat, primate) Unsafe burial practices Citizen of nation with poor health care system Living in area of high population density Low trust in government or institutions Deforestation/Vector & resivour displacement Sex if virus present in semen Not airborne in nature Not infectious until symptom sporadic outbreaks have taken place in south-sudan since 2013. EVD has claimed the lives of at least 11,325, infecting at least 28,657. the disease also spread to Nigeria, Senegal, and mali. ebola virus is one of the five known ebolaviruses (RNA viruses of the family Filvovirus) four ebolaviruses (Sudan virus, Bundibugyo virus, Tai Forest virus, and Ebola virus) cause EVD, whereas Reston virus only infects non-human primates and pigs. fected cells release inflammatory proteins called cytokines. this process amplifies upon itself, cells become infected, die, produce cytokines, bringing in more cells, which become infected, die, etc. this creates an uncontrolled cascade of inflammation known as a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d which can damage the patient\u2019s own tissues and organs. patient care for EVD is primarily volume replacement, pain control, acid/base balancing, and support for blood pressure, oxygen, and nutrition. standard public health measures were able to curtail the outbreak such as rapid identification and isolation of confirmed cases followed by tracing all their contacts. female sexual partners of male EVD survivors could contract the disease due to viral persistence in semen for several months. some outlets stated that you could not contract EVD from a person unless they were symptomatic. a better phrasing may be that a person is not contagious until they manifest symptoms. authors implicated deforestation as a possible contributor to the outbreak. most articles did not cite these environmental findings as underpinnings of the outbreak. 2013 EVD outbreak greatly increased academic journal attention. s that did appear de novo after 2013 included the increased risk of spontaneous abortion for pregnant females. it was reported that MSF received early reports of patients with viral syndromes accompanied by hiccups. this was the basis for their early appeals to the world health organization to provide a rapid response to the first EVD outbreak in a densely populated area. hypotension/Shock, Multi-organ/system failure 75 65.6 100 100 5.3 1.0 2.3 0 Neurologic/Confusion 100 31.3 100 100 2.6 0.3 0.8 0 Fatigue/Malaise 75 71.9 100 100 18.4 2.0 5.3 0 Shortness of breath, chest pain, cough 100 56.3 100 100 0.0 1.3 0.8 3.8 Macular-Macolupapular rash 75 53.1 100 100 0.0 0.3 1.5 0 Mucosal Hemorr 0.8 0 Perceived and Actual Risk Vulnerable populations Pregnant females (abortion, placenta previa) 0 15.6 0 100 2.6 0.3 0.0 0 Adults over 45 0 6.3 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 Adults over 45 0 6.3 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 Adults over 45 0 6.3 0 0 0.0 0.0 0 Adults over 45 0 6.3 0 suspected cases 25 56.3 100 100 28.9 33.3 23.3 19.2 Contact tracing, monitoring 25 50.0 0 100 18.4 16.7 27.1 0 Quick reporting/recognition of cases 25 59.4 0 100 7.9 4.0 2.3 3.8 Class II/BSL4 biosafety handling of samples 75 34.4 100 100 5.3 0.3 3.0 3.8 Environmental decontamination 50 43.8 100 100 18.4 6.7 13.5 11.5 Behavior change comm/Community 0 0.0 0 100 5.3 4.7 3.0 3.8 Screening Travelers 0 56.3 0 100 13.2 14.0 4.5 15.4 Trust and role of institutions Nations impacted Liberia 93.8 100 57.9 57.0 69.9 42.3 Sierra Leone 93.8 100 36.8 42.7 69.2 19.2 Guinea 93.8 100 28.9 40.7 68.4 15.4 Nigeria 78.1 0 23.7 9.0 6.8 3.8 Senegal 65.6 0 15.

EVD affected nations outside of the african continent. ia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone all had citizens either infected or treated. ebola virus is one of the five known ebolaviruses (RNA viruses of the family Filvovirus) EVD is one of the hemorrhagic fevers (along with disease caused by Marburg virus and others), while Reston virus only infects non-human primates and pigs. despite pop-culture imagery less than half of the patients stricken with EVD manifest bleeding complications. EVD may cause abnormalities in white blood cell counts (either too many or too few), decreased platelets, and evidence of hepatitis, renal failure, protein loss, and pancreatitis. advanced disease is associated with lactic acidosis, clotting abnormalities, and evidence of disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. the CDC and WHO supported screening travelers for fever departing from western african nations. a blanket travel ban was not advised, as they blocked resources from entering and leaving afflicted nations. strict and frequent decontamination of sample processing and patient care areas with bleach containing solutions was widely practiced. some outlets stated that you could not contract EVD from a person unless they were symptomatic. a better phrasing may be that a person is not contagious until they manifest symptoms. this phrasing would capture the potential for survivors to spread the virus via semen. the 2013 EVD outbreak greatly increased academic journal attention. from 2013 through the search date, there were 3,615 total articles and 278 review articles. this represents a nearly 25-fold increase in annual academic coverage. a clustering of suspicious deaths alerted MSF officials that the outbreak potentially represented a serious outbreak of hemorrhagic fever. this was the basis for their early appeals to the world health organization to provide a rapid response to the first EVD outbreak in a densely populated area [17]. alaise 75 71.9 100 100 18.4 2.0 5.3 0 Shortness of breath, chest pain, cough 100 56.3 100 100 0.0 1.3 0.8 3.8 Macular-Macolupapular rash 75

omission was scored if the author did not make it clear that their list of PPE supplies was not all-inclusive. authors stating that PPE \u201cincludes\u201d certain items were not scored as erroneous

patients with EVD develop signs of bleeding. authors stating that PPE \u201cincludes\u201d certain items were not scored as erroneous. the most frequent error across all media was confusion over the airborne transmission potential for EVD. the first included intentionally spraying primates with a blood-containing aerosol contaminated with Ebola virus. the official consensus on fomite spread of EVD is that the science is unclear. there have not been reported cases connected to fomite spread. there have been no cases of EVD suspected of aerosolized transmission. a low number of printed pages did not preclude complete or accurate articles. a low number of printed pages did not preclude complete or accurate articles. completeness and errors did not correlate to markers of journal quality. academic journals carried a higher error rate than magazines, newspapers, and blogs, but not alternative media. errors in newspaper writings were associated with anonymous authorship and being a letter to the editor or editorial. blogs were more likely to cover epidemiological data, but were least likely to discuss means to preventing spread within the population. there were no significant associations between completeness and generalized measurements of article prestige Impact factor is often considered to be the central measure of a journal\u2019s prestige. academic journals had significantly more completeness and errors per article. the mean academic publication covered 45.1% of the gleaned topics. magazines (11.4%), newspapers (7.1%), blogs (9.3%), and alternative sites (4.9%) lagged behind. no differences in accuracy were seen between magazines, newspapers, or blogs. alternative media articles were significantly less complete than blogs and magazines. magazines tended to more closely mirror academic journal subject focus, covering symptoms, risk factors, pathogenesis, and virology. s precluded a similar assessment of these intermediaries, but these outlets can be important sources for writers in academia, media, as well as public policy. the longstanding pressure in academia to \u2018publish or perish\u2019 has been heightened by online journals that cannot be distinguished from respected peer-reviewed counterparts by the untrained eye. no researcher could test for all possible variables such as ambient temperature, porousness of the bowling ball, length on contact, skin integrity of the bowler, starting inoculum, etc. communications to the public should stress that any actionable policy trying to curtail airborne EVD would waste resources and that no one should cancel their bowling plans. academicians may use Bayesian prediction modeling to calculate odds on their statements of \u2018possibility\u2019 as a means of allowing for a more serious presentation regarding the need to act when translated for the public. researchers could also use social media and press releases to communicate the actionable items in their findings directly within their manuscript. academic authors could look to recent evidence on clearer public communication. use of the word \u2018enhance\u2019 by scientists meant to convey \u2018intensify\u2019. but perceived by the public to mean \u2018improve\u2019. alternative media outlets actively presented disinformation about EVD. however, other lay press sources made accurate statements about the transmission of EVD. this could indicate that public health officials and academicians may find a willing partner in some written press sources. the major limitation in this study is that the lay press collected was not all-inclusive. it was not feasible with the resources at hand to collect all media coverage. however, the ease of accessibility of the media included did not predict content or accuracy. it is unknown if any reporters, politicians, or pundits made inaccurate statements. this work may still achieve its goal of comparing the contemporaneous academic reviews available to reporters and policy makers at the time of their background research. this analysis stops with the outbreak\u2019s containment, which therefore overlooks the long-term chronic pains and visual changes. complete list of lay press citations. number corresponds to text references and table listings."}
