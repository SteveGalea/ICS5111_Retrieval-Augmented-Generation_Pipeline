{"summary": "a diverse set of protein toxins from distantly related organisms have a propensity to catalyze nucleic acid modifying or cleaving reactions in their target cells. plants deploy toxins such as ricin, abrin and modeccin to protect their seeds, which are RNA N-glycosidases that remove a specific purine base from eukaryotic 28S rRNA. colicins E3, E4 and E6 cleave rRNA, colicins E5 and D cleave tRNA and colicins E2, E7, E8 and E9 cleave DNA (8). bacterial genomes are also colonized by systems such as the toxin\u2013antitoxin systems which produce enzymes that function as nucleic acid-targeting toxins. this article presents the results of such a strategy that helped us uncover and characterize a remarkable, diverse class of nuclease toxins. the protein was first recovered in a screen for S. cerevisiae mutants that confer resistance to the killer toxin produced by the competing yeast species Hansenula mrakii (16,17) a novel contact-dependent inhibitory (CDI) toxin system has been reported in proteobacteria that delivers multiple nuclease toxins into target cells (24,25). these observations prompted us to systematically investigate both the bacterial and eukaryotic Smi1/Knr4 homologs. METHODS Iterative sequence profile searches were run using the PSI-BLAST program (26) against the non-redundant protein database of national center for biotechnology information (NCBI) similarity based clustering for both classification and culling of nearly identical sequences was performed using the BLASTCLUST program. the Modeller9v1 program was used for homology modeling of the structure of the IRS1 N-terminal domain. the in-house TASS package was used to automate aspects of large-scale analysis of sequences, structures and genome context.

Smi1/Knr4 defines a large superfamily of conserved domains that is widespread in bacteria, eukaryotes and various DNA viruses but practically absent in currently sequenced archaeal genomes. we named it the SUKH (for Syd, US22, Knr4 homology) domain superfamily. mi1-like or SUKH-1 group includes the majority of the SUKH domains. this group is widely distributed across most bacterial lineages. the group prototyped by CA_C3700 (gi: 15896931) is widely distributed across most bacterial lineages. SUKH-1 is likely to represent the ancestral group from within which the above clades have diversified through rapid sequence divergence. the consensus was derived using the following amino acid classes: a, aromatic (FHWY, black on orange); b, big (EFHIKLMQRWY, black on light blue); h, hydrophobic (ACFGHILMTVWY, black on light blue); l, aliphatic (ILV, black on dark yellow); p this method has proven particularly effective in both function prediction and identification of new analogous systems. we performed a detailed analysis of the gene-neighborhoods of all bacterial genes encoding a protein with this domain. we found numerous genomic neighborhoods that linked two or more adjacent genes encoding SUKH domain proteins. multiple paralogs could represent different versions of the same component of a system which is under selection to display diversity. the second major feature that emerged from the analysis of gene neighborhoods was the linkage of genes encoding diverse SUKH superfamily members to genes encoding different types of nucleases. individual genes are represented as box arrows pointing from the 5\u2032 to the 3\u2032-end of the coding frame. for each operon, the gi of the SUKH gene (marked with a star) and species name are indicated. most ORFs shown as gray boxes are small ones that appear to be false gene predictions. all these proteins showed a characteristic feature of possessing a highly variable but globular domain at the extreme C-terminus of the protein, downstream of the repetitive region. these proteins usually contain certain domains related to adhesion and the two-partner secretory (TPS) system N-terminal to the repetitive region, such as PAAR (PFAM: PF05488). studies on CDI systems indicated that the toxin function resides in the polymorphic C-terminal domains. in these cases they are linked to other N-terminal domains that are distinct from the TpsA-SD and hemagglutinin repeat domains. these domains are nuclease toxins that cleave both tRNAs and DNA (25) gene neighborhoods encoding SUKH proteins and linked nucleases or CDI toxin are highly variable in terms of being present or absent between different strains of the same species. this kind of phyletic and genomic polymorphism is also typical of loci involved in inter- and intra-genomic competition such as toxin\u2013antitoxin. sequence analysis reveals the presence of 11 distinct families of nuclease toxins encoded by genes adjacent to those of the SUKH superfamily. several of those identified here belong to entirely new families or are highly distinctive previously unrecognized versions of previously known families. arrows indicate the polarity of domain arrangement in a polypeptide. newly identified domains include DUF637-N, A-link (-helical PT domain), WXG-like, LDXD, NUC_N, PT-TGE. the active site of these enzymes is formed at the interface of the characteristic helix and -hairpin and contains a divalent cation. the residues chelating the metal are typically histidine, aspartate and asparagine but their exact configuration can greatly vary between different members of this fold. we observed eight distinct families spanning the entire gamut ranging from conventional HNH nucleases to highly derived forms that have not been identified before. a subset of the GH-E family preserves the conserved cysteines of the treble-clef. we also recovered three other novel families of domains, which are respectively typified by nearly absolutely conserved tripeptide sequence motifs LHH, WHH and AHH. a, firmicutes, actinobacteria, synergistetes, synergistetes and bacteroidetes that combine genes for WHH and SUKH domain proteins (Figure 2). the AHH domain is also found in similarly organized gene-neighborhoods from the same bacterial lineages as those in which the WHH and LHH domains are found. the best matches are families of the HNH fold. comparison revealed the representatives of HNH domains as the best hits. we named this family of HNH domains as DH-NNK after the conserved DH dyad in the strand-1 and the two asparagines and lysine which are conserved in the helix of the core treble-clef fold. however, these domains retain the catalytic configuration typical of those nucleases. catalytic domain of these enzymes contains two elements each comprised of a single helix followed by a three-stranded unit. the catalytic residues appear to have emerged asymmetrically in a peculiar hairpin insertion within the helix of the first repeat. this hairpin insertion appears to be mobile and adopts different conformations in structures (60,61) the majority of the bacterial EndoU homologs are nuclease toxins that cleave RNAs in the competitor cells. those secreted by intracellular bacteria could be deployed as toxins or regulators to manipulate host physiology by cleaving specific transcripts. this suggests that the original radiation of this superfamily probably happened within the bacterial toxin systems. the predicted secondary structure pattern of these domains closely matched the REase fold with conserved D and ExK motif falling on a -hairpin as is typical of the REase fold. we recovered a composite profile made of diverse REase fold superfamilies such as the VRR-Nuc, lambda exonuclease, the archaeal Holliday junction resolvase and RecB as the best hits (P = 105) the first of these families belonged to the nucleotide deaminase superfamily. these enzymes are likely to function as toxins that mutate nucleic acids. the second of these families is characterized by a conserved signature [NS]HH followed by another conserved histidine. classical plasmid-encoded bacteriocins and cognate bacteriocins from other bacteria do not have secretory mechanisms. they hijack either the Tol or the Ton-dependent molecular import systems to enter the target cells. these colicins hijack either the Tol or the Ton-dependent molecular import systems to enter the target cells. -barrel transmembrane domains recognize secretory domains such as the TpsA-SD in the extreme N-terminal region of the CDI \u2018pro-toxins\u2019 to deliver them across the outer membrane of proteobacteria (64). this N-terminal region is separated from the C-terminal regions by repetitive regions with RHS- or filamentous hemagglutinin-type repeats. their uptake by the target cell is less-clearly understood analysis of the domain architectures of the nuclease domain-containing proteins encoded in the SUKH-superfamily neighborhoods revealed that the majority of the proteins followed an architectural logic. however, only a relatively small subset of the SUKH domain-associated systems overlap with the CDI systems. further the SUKH superfamily proteins and functionally linked toxins are also found outside of proteobacteria. a subset of these have been included in the erroneously annotated model. this domain possessed a conserved [LF]XG sequence motif. it was predicted to assume an -helical bundle fold based on the multiple sequence alignment (Supplementary Data) a fourth group of proteins, restricted to certain firmicutes, is typified by yet another N-terminal helical domain (LDXD in Figure 5) that is also found in domain architectural contexts very similar to the WXG and LXG domains. it is conceivable that this domain is comparable to them and functions similarly as a mediator of export via the HerA-FtsK superfamily pumps. multiple proteins only within the genus Planctomyces are seen in predicted nuclease toxins from this organism. a group of large toxin proteins with RHS repeats are defined by the presence of a conserved transmembrane domain with two TM segments just N-terminal to the PAAR domains. these proteins lack PAAR domains but the firmicute versions have additional hedgehog-intein (HINT) peptidase domains that could aid in their coli Syd, an archetypal member of the SUKH superfamily, was first identified as a proof-reading component of the Sec-dependent export system (43\u201345) both actinomycetes and firmicutes do not display proteins with a PT domain with the VENN motif. however, in both these lines there was a conserved -helical domain that frequently occurred just to the N-terminus of several distinct nuclease modules in different predicted toxins a subset of smaller proteins with nuclease domains lack noticeable trafficking-related (N-terminal) domains. a subset of smaller proteins with nuclease domains lack noticeable trafficking-related (N-terminal) domains. auxiliary domains which might play a role in resistance, trafficking or processing of toxins. two other conserved protein families are encoded in toxin neighborhoods. they were not found in multi-domain architectures typical of the nuclease toxins. this suggests they were unlikely to be novel toxins but act as alternative immunity proteins just like the SuFu and SUKH superfamily proteins. phylogenetic analysis and phyletic patterns suggest there are two major eukaryotic lineages of the SUKH superfamily that are nested within the radiation of the bacterial versions. the FBXO3 lineage is present in animals, fungi, plants, stramenopiles and ciliates. the FBXO3 version is fused to an N-terminal F-box domain and a distinctive C-terminal immunoglobulin superfamily domain. in both plants and animals the FBXO3 version is fused to an N-terminal F-box domain and a distinctive C-terminal immunoglobulin superfamily domain. PGs2 and FBXO3 appear to have been largely vertically inherited and show no lineage-specific expansions within eukaryotes. this is in sharp contrast to the high propensity for lateral transfer and for lineage-specific expansions of the SUKH superfamily that is observed in bacteria. however, there were several features that suggested that biochemically the eukaryotic versions might be exploiting an ancient functional template provided by the SUKH domains in bacterial a fissure in sheet between the two-stranded N-terminal unit and the C-terminal 4-stranded meander is observed in most of them. this cleft is not negatively charged as in Syd, and may vary in depth and shape. in both these crystal structures one of the monomers is bound in the cleft of the other monomer resulting in an asymmetric dimer (Supplementary Data) the spread of the US22 group of the SUKH superfamily across unrelated or distantly related DNA viruses of animals suggests that it confers an important advantage to these viruses. this is also supported by the lineage-specific expansion in betaherpesviruses of the SUKH superfamily in the form of multigene arrays similar to what is seen in bacteria. genetic conflicts in the bacterial world Classical colicins and earlier characterized CDIs act primarily on related bacterial strains of the same \u2018species\u2019. this might be because intracellular bacteria are much less likely to encounter a heavy load of competing cells in the same niche. plasmid-borne colicins are competitors that affect the plasmid fitness. plasmid toxins are unlikely to have ready access to trafficking by the host. plasmid toxins are unlikely to have ready access to trafficking by the host. presence of chromosomally encoded toxin that acts at a short range is likely to be selected, resulting in the proliferation of systems such as those described here. presence of a chromosomally encoded toxin that acts at a short range is likely to be selected, resulting in the proliferation of systems such as those described here. the presence of nuclease and nucleic acid deaminase domains as the primary toxin modules of these systems raises the possibility that their nucleic acid cleaving or mutating activity is involved in triggering recombination events. this appears plausible given the observations that most of these nucleases are likely to be endonucleases, which like their counterpart in the restriction-modification systems could cleave at specific sequences. a protein with two TM segments is likely to form a membrane channel (Supplementary Data) and have a mode of action very distinct from the SUKH superfamily. both the SUKH and the SuFu superfamily domains have been used as adaptors that regulate recognition of different substrates by protein modification systems. a nuclease found in the bacterial toxin typified by the N. gonorrhoea protein NGO1392 is found in several eukaryotic lineages. it is unlikely that the nuclease functions as a toxin in eukaryotes. but it is possible that it has been recruited as a DNA-repair enzyme. a crystal structure for YobK has been solved by the joint structural genomics initiative (PDB: 2PRV) we used this structure as a query for structure similarity searches using the DALIlite program and recovered hits to four other homologous structures (3FFV, 2PAG, 2ICG, 3D5P; Z > 7.5) homologous proteins are present in a number of distantly related or unrelated DNA viruses. the above searches also recovered hits to two distinct groups of proteins each with over 100 representatives in the nr database. despite the low average pairwise sequence similarity, all representatives are known or predicted to possess a similar core fold. five major groups can be recognized within the SUKH domain superfamily. the first of these, and the most widespread, is the one typified by Smi1/Knr4, FBXO3, SKIP16, PGs2 and YobK. the second group, prototyped by Syd, is the Syd-like or SUKH-2 group. phylogenetic analysis of each group, along with the phyletic patterns, strongly suggests that the groups SUKH-2\u20135 are monophyletic clades. the largest group, SUKH-1 is likely to represent the ancestral group from within which the above clades have diversified through rapid sequence divergence. a detailed analysis of the gene-neighborhoods of all bacterial genes encoding a protein with this domain. we found several genomic neighborhoods that linked two or more adjacent genes encoding a protein with this domain. we found tandem arrays with up to six paralogous SUKH superfamily genes. genes encoding proteins belonging to the Smi1-like (SUKH-1), Syd-like (SUKH-2), SUKH-3 and SUKH-4 groups in the same neighborhood in several bacteria such as B. cereus MM3 and various Streptomyces species. this situation, where multiple paralogous genes are linked together as tandem arrays in a gene neighborhood, is relatively rare in bacteria (49) several of the HNH domains were related to similar nuclease domains found in previously studied bacteriocins. these linkages involved members of both the Smi1-like and Syd-like groups. despite their diversity, potential functional interactions with different types of nuclease domains are a common feature of the bacterial representatives of the SUKH superfamily. structures of HNH and EndoG families shown as cartoon representations. 'asterisk' indicates conserved histidine required for activation of water molecule. 'asterisk' indicates conserved asparagines. in-repeats combined with polymorphic C-terminal domains vary greatly between different CDI toxins. in all these CDI proteins the polymorphic C-terminal domain is separated from the repetitive region by either or both of two small -helical domains annotated as domains of unknown function in the PFAM database (DUF638 or DUF637) also, it was shown that the protein encoded by the gene following the CDI toxin was an immunity gene. gene neighborhoods encoding SUKH proteins and linked nucleases or CDI toxin are highly variable in terms of being present or absent between different strains of the same species. this type of phyletic polymorphism is typical of loci involved in inter- and intra-genomic competition such as toxin\u2013antitoxin, restriction-modification and virulence toxin systems. the polymorphic C-terminal domains of two CDI toxins have not been characterized. we speculated that these domains, along with some of the other uncharacterized domains in proteins encoded by conserved gene-neighborhoods, might be as yet uncharacterized nuclease domains. the eukaryotic EndoU domain (PDB: 2c1w) is shown to the right to indicate the spatial position of the conserved elements. the structure of the archaeal Holliday junction resolvase (PDB: 1OB8) is shown to the right to indicate the spatial position of the conserved residues. the treble-clef fold is one of the most prevalent Zn-binding motifs across the three superkingdoms of life (56). classical HNH nucleases, like the restriction endonuclease (REase) McrA and the T4 endonuclease VII, contain the four conserved, Zn-chelating cysteines of the treble-clef fold (52) but these domains still retain the characteristic structural geometry of the treble a treble-clef domain which has lost the characteristic cysteines is inserted between two copies of a three-stranded domain with distinct loop-like C-terminal extensions. the structural organization of the nucA domain suggests that it arose from an ancestral HNH/EndoVII domain, which carried\u2019 these duplicated three-stranded units along with it to form a more complex domain. protein, have proximal toxin genes with a LHH domain as the polymorphic C-terminal unit of their products. also, the LHH domain is found in products of genes adjacent to the SUKH superfamily gene outside of proteobacteria in several other bacterial lineages. however, none of these have a SUKH superfamily immunity protein. the eighth family of HNH fold enzymes emerging from this analysis comprises of proteins typified by the protein Dd586_1447 from D. dadanti found in predicted toxins in SUKH neighborhoods. a subset of these domains constitutes the PFAM model for a \u2018domain of unknown function\u2019, DUF1994, that does not define the boundaries of this domain precisely. nuclease toxins of the endoU fold The endoU nuclease domain is typified by the nuclease domain previously identified in the U-specific, metal-dependent endonuclease. a related endonuclease was identified in nidoviruses, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus. a further set of bacterial nucleases of this family are predicted secreted versions encoded by intracellular symbiotic and pathogenic bacteria. most bacterial versions that we identified are extremely divergent relative to the eukaryotic and viral forms. the identification of these relationships represents a significant extension of this superfamily (Figure 4A, Supplementary Data) we found several proteins with this fold to be encoded by genes that are neighbors of SUKH superfamily genes. these versions were originally identified as a distinct conserved domain of unclear affinities. however, the multiple sequence alignment of this domain showed a characteristic signature of conserved residues of the form GE-D-ExK-Q. characterized as the toxin domain of the colicins E3 and E6. the version of this domain in colicin E3 has been demonstrated to function as an EndoRNAse that specifically cleaves the phosphoester bond between bases 1493 and 1494 of 16S ribosomal RNA (63) the treble-clef fold is one of the most prevalent Zn-binding motifs across the three superkingdoms of life (56) the treble-clef fold contains the four conserved, Zn-chelating cysteines of the treble-clef fold. the active site of these enzymes is formed at the interface of the characteristic helix and -hairpin and contains a divalent cation. nucleases of this fold occurring in the neighborhood of the SUKH superfamily. the conventional HNH versions (e.g.AM1_0143, gi: 158333371 from the cyanobacterium A. marina) retain all the four cysteines of the treble-clef fold and a typical arrangement of residues chelating the catalytic metal. others, like the nuclease domains of the PSPTO_3229 protein from P. hoods contain an active site similar to the NucA nucleases, but are standalone versions without the two flanking three-stranded units. a subset of the GH-E family preserves the conserved cysteines of the treble-clef suggesting that they indeed represent the potential evolutionary intermediate from a classical HNH domain to the derived NucA-like forms. a visual examination of the conservation patterns of these three domains showed that the HH dyad shared by them corresponds to the HH or DH dipeptide found in the first strand of treble-clef fold of the classical HNH domains (52). the first H forms one of the catalytic metal-chelating ligands and the second H contributes to the active site that directs the water for phosphoester hydrolysis (58,59). DH dyad in the strand-1 and asparagines and lysine which are conserved in the helix of the core treble-clef fold. the catalytic domain of these enzymes contains two elements each comprised of a single helix followed by a three-stranded unit. the catalytic residues, i.e. two histidines, appear to be nucleases with a similar catalytic mechanism. we found that the bacterial members of the EndoU family are linked to genes of the SUKH superfamily mainly in firmicutes and proteobacteria. other than SUKH superfamily gene-neighborhoods, related versions also comprise the polymorphic C-terminal domain of the CDI toxins from Moraxella and Mannheimia. the bacteria contain the greatest diversity of this superfamily. some versions closer to the eukaryotic and nidoviral versions are more divergent. this suggests that the original radiation of this superfamily happened within the bacterial toxin systems. ase fold superfamilies such as the VRR-Nuc, lambda exonuclease, the archaeal Holliday junction resolvase and RecB as the best hits (P = 105). this suggests that this family defines a novel group of REase-fold nucleases. we predict that these toxins are likely to cleave the DNA of the target cells. the first of these families belonged to the nucleotide deaminase superfamily. these enzymes are likely to function as toxins that mutate nucleic acids in the target cells. the second of these families is characterized by a conserved signature [NS]HH followed by another conserved histidine. plasmid-borne colicins and cognate bacteriocins from other bacteria do not have secretory mechanisms. their release appears to occur primarily through cell-lysis mediated by the colicin-release proteins (8). chromosomally encoded proteobacterial CDI system toxins do not require lysis. the first step of this process appears to depend on the outer membrane-biogenesis protein BamA recognizing a conserved -helical domain immediately N-terminal to the toxin module. a proteolysis step at the cell surface releases just the C-terminal nuclease module for uptake by the target cell (25). despite the differences between the CDI and classical colicin-like systems they share a common feature of the toxin activity being borne by the extreme C- only a relatively small subset of the SUKH domain-associated systems overlap with the CDI systems. further the SUKH superfamily proteins and functionally linked toxins are also found outside of proteobacteria. analysis of these distinct pre-nuclease and extreme N-terminal domains might reveal features pertaining to the trafficking of toxins in non-CDI systems. profile\u2013profile comparisons showed that the domain is encoded by certain conserved gene-neighborhood across firmicutes. this domain is associated with genes coding for a YueA-like HerA-FtsK superfamily protein pump and a small protein related to the S. aureus EsaC protein. this domain is likely to utilize the ATP-dependent YueA pumps as partners for extrusion from the producing cell. in Actinobacteria, but not firmicutes, we observed several large proteins with architectures similar to the CDIs of the proteobacteria. these typically contain RHS repeats; however, their extreme N-terminal domains did not bear any close relationship to the proteobacterial TpsA-SD. all these proteins are typified by the presence of a conserved transmembrane domain with two TM segments just N-terminal to the PAAR domains. we propose that these TM segments are required for their trafficking to the cell membrane, following which they might be processed in the periplasm for release via the outer membrane. the firmicute versions have additional hedgehog-intein (HINT) peptidase domains that could aid in their release on the cell-surface. both actinomycetes and firmicutes do not display proteins with a PT domain with the VENN motif (PT-VENN) this domain frequently occurred just to the N-terminus of several distinct nuclease modules in different predicted toxins. the PT-TG domain might play a role similar to the PT-VENN domain in Gram-positive bacteria and mediate interaction of the extruded toxin with cell-surface receptors on the target cells. a subset of the smaller proteins with nuclease domains lack noticeable trafficking-related (N-terminal) domains. the smaller proteins with nuclease domains lack noticeable trafficking-related (N-terminal) domains. family 1 and 2 occupy positions similar to the SUKH and SuFu superfamily genes. they were not found in multi-domain architectures typical of the nuclease toxins. this suggested that they were unlikely to be novel toxins but act as alternative immunity proteins just like the SuFu and SUKH superfamily proteins. these domains are a specific signal recognized by the YueA-like ATPases of the HerA-FtsK superfamily that secrete them in an ATP-dependent manner (65,66). this indicated that the domain-containing toxins in Gram-positive bacteria are extruded by YueA-like pumps using an ATP-dependent mechanism. the protein Srot_0310 from the actinobacterium S. rotundus contains two copies of a distinct domain N-terminal to the GH-E nuclease domain. this domain is widely found in several actinobacteria at the N-termini of putative cell-surface proteins. it is conceivable that this domain is comparable to them and functions similarly as a mediator of export via the HerA-FtsK superfamily pumps. the protein DIP1652 (gi: 38234225) from C. diphtheria shows another distinct low complexity repeat N-terminal to the nuclease domain. a distinctive signal peptide is seen in predicted nuclease toxins from this organism. these observations suggest that at least some nuclease toxins in bacterial lineages are probably delivered to the cell using the conventional Sec-dependent system (68) both actinomycetes and firmicutes do not display proteins with a PT domain with the VENN motif. the PT-TG domain might play a role similar to the PT-VENN domain in Gram-positive bacteria and mediate interaction of the extruded toxin with cell-surface receptors on the target the nuclease_N domain is predicted to be an -helical domain. it could also play a role in the delivery of the toxin module into the host cells. the smaller proteins with nuclease domains lack noticeable trafficking-related (N-terminal) domains. two other conserved protein families are encoded in the toxin neighborhoods (SUKH-neighborhood conserved family 1 and 2; SNCF1 and SNCF2, Supplementary Data) they were not found in multi-domain architectures typical of the nuclease toxins. this suggested that they were unlikely to be novel toxins but act as alternative immunity proteins just like the SuFu and SUKH superfamily proteins. PT domains such as PT-VENN, PT-TG and the nuclease toxin domain are likely to serve as a peptidase that undergoes autoproteolytic cleavage. it is conceivable that this cleavage step is regulated by the interaction of the PT domains with the surface receptor on the target cell. the PGs2 version is found in basal eukaryotes such as Giardia and Spironucleus, animals and chlorophyte algae. it is present in animals, fungi, plants, stramenopiles and ciliates. however, it does not group with the PGs2 lineage, instead grouping with other bacterial forms. PGs2 and FBXO3 appear to have been largely vertically inherited. this is in sharp contrast to the high propensity for lateral transfer. this is in sharp contrast to the high propensity for lateral transfer and for lineage-specific expansions within eukaryotes. e toxins that are extremely diverse in sequence and structure. the SUKH domain contains a scaffold that has been adapted to recognize a diverse set of protein partners. this cleft is formed by the space between the conserved helix H3 and the fissure in sheet between two sets of strands. in vertebrates the SuFu ortholog has been shown to bind Gli2 and Gli3. it prevents degradation due to ubiquitination by F-box E3 ligases. this feature appears to have resulted in them being used as adaptors for recruiting other proteins in eukaryotic regulatory systems. another paralog UL38 inhibits the host cell stress responses by antagonizing the tuberous sclerosis protein complex in the endoplasmic reticulum (87,88) another paralog UL36 counters apoptosis in conjunction with yet another paralog UL36 (89,90). the viral versions of the SUKH domain proteins in general bind diverse host proteins that are used against the virus. plasmid-borne bacteriocins are relatively rare on chromosomes. 99.25% of the systems recovered in our study are chromosomally encoded. none of the systems identified in this study or the CDIs have lysis genes in their neighborhoods. the toxin domains of many chromosomal versions appear to be borne on filamentous structures that are primarily geared toward elimination of competitors that come in contact with the cell-surface (25,93) therefore, these systems are likely to be critical in the context of the formation and organization of biofilms and solid substrate colonies. presence of a chromosomally encoded toxin that acts at a short range is likely to be selected, resulting in the proliferation of systems such as those described recombination with cassettes with distinct C-terminal modules is the primary proximal mechanism for diversification of the toxin proteins across all bacterial lineages. the presence of nuclease and nucleic acid deaminase domains as primary toxin modules of these systems raises the possibility that their nucleic acid cleaving or mutating activity is involved in triggering recombination events. phyletic and phylogenetic analysis of the SUKH superfamily indicates three salient features. rampant lateral transfer between different branches of the bacterial tree, gene loss and lineage-specific expansion followed by divergence of the lineage-specific paralogs. this suggests that there is a notable trend for maintaining diversity within the SUKH superfamily that probably arises from selection for recognition of a diverse range of nucleic acid-modifying toxins. endoU nuclease domain recruited by nidoviruses for replication of negative-strand RNA genome. a related domain was recruited by eukaryotes for processing of certain snRNAs. a HNH/EndoVII fold nuclease found in the bacterial toxin. classical colicins encoded on plasmids, which might be single copy, medium-sized conjugative plasmids or small multi-copy small plasmids. 99.25% of the systems recovered in our study are chromosomally encoded. lysis of the cell nullifies the fitness of the chromosome. plasmid toxins are unlikely to have ready access to trafficking by the host. the loss of the cells producing the colicin would endanger the resident plasmid, but a relatively small fraction of the host population is affected. by the principle of inclusive fitness of kin, the plasmid could still have an enhancement of fitness from the copies in the surviving cell along with the elimination of competitors. this is consistent with a recent study on the diversification of RHS proteins in enterobacteria which showed that the RHS proteins undergo C-terminal polymorphism due to rampant recombination with invading cassettes. this type of recombination or gene-conversion with polymorphic C-terminal cassettes might explain the presence of smaller loci found in the gene-neighborhoods characterized here that encode just a nuclease domain by itself pore-forming versions have predominantly utilized recombination for diversification. pore-forming nucleases have mainly evolved through positive selection. phyletic and phylogenetic analysis of the SUKH superfamily indicates three salient features. both the SUKH and the SuFu superfamily domains have been used as adaptors that regulate recognition of different substrates by protein modification systems such as ubiquitination and polyglutamylation. the nuclease domains ultimately derived from various toxins also appear to have been used for different functions by eukaryotes and their viruses. the current study points to the remarkable flexibility of SUKH domains in mediating different protein\u2013protein interactions. the ability of the scaffold to accommodate diverse binding partners makes it a potential candidate as a template for protein engineering to generate novel binding capabilities."}
