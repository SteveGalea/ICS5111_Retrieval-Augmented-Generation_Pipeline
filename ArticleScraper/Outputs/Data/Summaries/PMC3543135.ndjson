{"summary": "from 2008\u20132010, 5,056 articles in 5 infectious diseases journals cited 166,650 items. two random samples were drawn: one (n = 1,060) from the total set of citations. for each sample citation, publication type and date, age of cited item, and inclusion of uniform resource locator (URL) infectious disease professionals will always need access to information to help answer their questions. bibliometric analysis is a form of bibliometric analysis that examines citation patterns in a discipline's primary literature. the incidence of emerging infectious diseases outbreaks has risen considerably since 1940, 60% of which were caused by zoonotic pathogens 14. a retrospective study of global trends in emerging infectious diseases concluded that the incidence of emerging infectious diseases outbreaks has risen considerably since 1940, 60% of which were caused by zoonotic pathogens. a total of 5,056 articles produced 166,650 citations, including 151,807 (91.1%) citations to journal articles. a total of 5,056 articles produced 166,650 citations, including 151,807 (91.1%) citations to journal articles. the second sample provided information on which journals were the most frequently cited. the researchers used an online sample size generator to determine a sample size for each group that had a 95% confidence level and a +/3% confidence interval 21. Bradford zones is a common methodology that ranks cited journals in descending order, from most to least cited, and divides the list into three zones with equal citation counts. zone 1 contains the most heavily cited journal titles, those accounting for the top third of the citations, and is always the smallest zone. the median year of cited item publication was 2004, the mean was 2001, and the mode was 2007. Journal articles were most likely to be cited within 5 years of publication. 8.0% (77) cited journal articles were 21 or more years old at time of citation. Table 5 lists top journal subject categories by number of unique journal titles cited. other citation types were rare, the next most popular being miscellaneous items with 4.6% (n = 49) just over half of all cited journal articles were published within the previous 5 years. 8.0% (77) cited journal articles were 21 or more years old at time of citation. miscellaneous items and government documents were very unlikely to be older. 75% of all citations fell within this small group of subject categories. table 5 lists the top journal subject categories by number of unique journal titles cited and by number of total citations to journals in those subject disciplines. infectious disease prevention and control is one of the key areas of public health. cited publication types in public health disciplines are in environmental health, where 85.5% of citations were to journal articles 30. however, infectious disease literature's citation patterns closely mimicked general clinical medicine and biomedical research literature, which cites 91%\u201393% journal articles fairly steadily over time 31, 32. 3.4% of all journals cited contributed 34.1% of the citations, much like previously published studies in epidemiology 35, general public health 13, 28, tropical medicine 33, 36, tuberculosis 10 and occupational health 37. no journals classified by the JCR Science Edition as \u201cPublic, Environmental, and Occupational Health\u201d appeared in the Zone 1 journal titles. the most cited SARS literature was published in biological journals 25. the only journals with comparative speed were NEJM and Lancet 38. this contrasts with a study of the Minnesota Department of Health's citation patterns. Core Public Health Journals Project Version 2.0 (Core Journals) 17 has several categories relevant to public health professionals and researchers working with infectious diseases. many Zone 2 titles do not appear anywhere in the Core Journals, including Virology, Journal of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy, and Hepatology. infectious disease specialists in public health research and practice work across a range of fields to keep the public safe. libraries supporting infectious disease specialists may wish to focus their collection budgets on providing access to key journal literature, as it is overwhelmingly the most cited material. Vaccine development, disease genetics, diagnostics, or other areas of microbiology, virology, or immunology are crucial to infectious disease research. libraries serving only local public health departments without laboratory facilities may not require subscription-based access to the more basic science titles."}
