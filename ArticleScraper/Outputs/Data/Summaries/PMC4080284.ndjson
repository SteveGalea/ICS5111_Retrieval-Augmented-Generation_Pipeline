{"summary": "human lungs were isolated from deidentified organ donors whose lungs were not suitable for transplantation. we selected donors with reasonable lung function with a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of >225, no history of clinical lung disease, and a time on the ventilator of less than 5 days. the aging study defined young donors as below 40 yr of age and aged donors as over 65 yr of age. isolated cells were resuspended in modified Eagle's medium. they were supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 2 mM glutamine, 2.5 g/ml amphotericin B, 100 g/ml streptomycin, 100 g/ml penicillin G and 10 g/ml gentamicin. one million cells per square centimeter were plated on either 12- or 24-well cell culture plates. crisscross scratch wounds were made in the AEC monolayer cultured in a 12-well plate. the inserts with the AMs were placed over the scratched AEC monolayer. cells were then washed and cultured for 24 h in DMEM without serum overnight.

HGF restores delayed wound closure due to age and CS. incidence and mortality of ALI/ARDS increase dramatically with age. primary human ATII cells were plated on bioFlex Collagen type I-coated culture plates for CS system (Flexcell tension system) at 48 h after wounding and starting CS, CS impaired wound closure and HGF restored the impairment. phase-contrast pictures were taken from marked wound areas at 0 and 24 h after wounding. values are means SE for comparison between wounds in AEC monolayers from 4 young and 4 elderly donors. phase-contrast pictures were taken from marked wound areas at 0 and 48 h after wounding. the phenotype of these AECs may be similar to what is found in an injured lung. ATII cells are the most susceptible to injury, presumably attributable to their large surface area and relative paucity of cellular organelles. the study is the first in vitro wound-healing assay using primary human AECs. soluble factors are likely important in other organs, which could have different levels of receptors and receptor activation. soluble factors are likely important in other organs or species, which could have different levels of receptors and receptor activation. HGF is a mitogen for rat ATII cells in vitro (34), and HGF stimulates both proliferation and migration of immortalized rat ATII cells (SV40-T2 cells). HGF increases cell migration but not proliferation during human nasal epithelial repair in vitro (66) we found that lamellipodia formation was enhanced by HGF in young subjects. however, we did not observe activation of Src and did not observe enhanced expression of vinculin (data not shown) the incidence rates and mortality of ALI/ARDS increase dramatically with age. animal models of ALI showed higher mortality and increased severity with age. skeletal muscle as a resident stem cell population migrate at less than half the speed of young cells. however, it did not alter the size of blebs on old satellite cells, which are similar to lamellipodia. additional studies will be needed to define the mechanism of delayed cell motility in the elderly. CS delayed wound closure and that HGF restored the delay in human AEC monolayers. ATII cells isolated from rats exposed to hyperoxia and high-tidal-volume mechanical ventilation exhibited significantly decreased cell adhesion. CS also decreased cell migration in human airway cell line 16HBE by inhibiting PI3 kinase and FAK-mediated JNK activation (11). conflicts of interest, financial or otherwise, are declared by the authors.
