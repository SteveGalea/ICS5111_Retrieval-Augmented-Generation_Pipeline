{"summary": "recombinant VSV expressing HL17, HL18, or NL11 were generated. the recombinant viruses also expressed the green fluorescent protein (GFP) or the secreted nano luciferase (sNLuc) from an extra transcription unit downstream of the glycoprotein genes. the hemagglutinin-like glycoproteins HL17 and HL18 contain monobasic proteolytic cleavage sites upstream of the highly conserved hydropho indicated cell lines were infected with the indicated viruses at an m.o.i. of 0.01. aliquots of cell-culture supernatant were collected and titrated. VSV*G-HL17 and VSV*G-HL18 (100 FFU) were incubated with chicken immune sera (1:100) raised against either HL17 or HL18 or without serum (w/o) and added to MDCK II cells. infected cells were detected 20 h after infection by GFP fluorescence. n.d.

MDCK II cells were infected with recombinant VSV*G vectors. the cells were processed as described above. no propagation of VSV*G-NL11 expressing the neuraminidase-like protein NL11 was observed. VSVG-HL18-NL11 expressing both HL18 and NL11 replicated to similar titers as VSV*G-HL18. several established cell lines of human, monkey, bat, canine, porcine, and avian origin were inoculated with VSV*G-HL17pb or VSV*G-HL18pb. most cell lines, including MDCK I cells, did not show any GFP expression, indicating that they are completely resistant to infection. the indicated cell lines were infected with either VSVG-HL18pb-sNLuc (B) or VSVG-HL17pb-sNLuc (C) by using an m.o.i. of 0.01. at 20 h p.i., the activity of the Nano luciferase reporter secreted into the cell-culture supernatant was determined. recombinant HL17NL10 could be successfully propagated on canine RIE 1495 cells. recombinant HL17NL10 showed a similar cell tropism as the chimeric VSV viruses. recombinant HL17NL10 and HL17NL10 showed a similar cell tropism. canine MDCK II cells (A) or RIE 1495 cells (B) were infected with either HL18NL11 or HL17NL10 both harboring an authentic proteolytic cleavage site. after 2 d in the presence of trypsin, cells were fixed and stained with antibodies directed to either HL18 (e) or HL17 (f) HL18 mediates Infection of polarized MDCK II cells from the basolateral site. infection with HL18NL11 occurred predominantly at the edges of the cell cultures. recombinant VSV* expressing the original VSV-G envelope protein entered the cells via the basolateral membrane (Fig. 4A) HL18NL11 particles were found at the apical plasma membrane of polarized MDCK II cells after infection with HL18NL11. similar apical HA localization was observed in polarized MDCK II cells after infection with the mouse-adapted influenza A virus. HL18 and H7 were detected at the cell surface by HL18- and H7-specific antibodies. indicated z scans were taken by using a confocal laser scanning microscope. number indicates the distance from the basal cell border. recombinant VSV expressing HL17, HL18, or NL11 were generated. recombinant VSV were generated and propagated in a trans-complementing helper cell line expressing HL proteins with a polybasic proteolytic cleavage site. the envelope of the viral particles produced in this way was equipped with the VSV-G protein, allowing primary infection of a broad range of cells independently of HL17 or HL18. the cells were maintained in serum-free medium either in the absence or presence of trypsin. aliquots of cell-culture supernatant were collected and titrated on MDCK II cells. Error bars indicate the mean and SD of three independent experiments. for comparison, replication of VSV*G-HL18 (red circles) is also shown.

HL18 induced syncytia in MDCK II cells if the protein was activated with trypsin. syncytia formation by HL18 and HL18pb was not observed in vero cells. syncytia formation in both cell types independently of trypsin. syncytia formation in both cell types independently of trypsin. the cells were infected with recombinant VSV*G vectors expressing the indicated HL and HA proteins and exposed to the indicated pH values. the cells were treated (+T) or nontreated (-T) with trypsin and shortly exposed to pH 5.2. VSV*G-HL18pb replicated in the absence of trypsin and reached titers of 2 106 FFU/mL at 36 h after inoculation. titers reached 105 FFU/mL if the medium contained trypsin. in contrast to VSV*G-HL18, no propagation of VSV*G-NL11 was observed. activity of nano luciferase produced by cells following infection with preimmune serum served as reference and was set to 100%. chimeric VSV encoding HL18 in place of the neuraminidase-like protein NL11 is able to propagate in MDCK II cells and does not rely on the presence of the neuraminidase-like protein. only EpoNi/22.1 cells derived from the africa bat species Epomops buettikoferi were susceptible to infection with VSV*G-HL18pb. however, infection of MDCK II and RIE 1495 cells with VSVG-HL17pb-sNLuc resulted in significantly lower levels of luciferase activity. Virus released into the cell culture supernatant was concentrated by ultracentrifugation and incubated with MDCK II cells that had been treated with bacterial sialidase. after 2 d in the presence of trypsin, several HL18-positive cells were observed. recombinant HL17NL10 (with the authentic proteolytic cleavage site) could be successfully propagated on canine RIE 1495 cells. canine MDCK II cells (A) or RIE 1495 cells (B) were infected with either HL18NL11 or HL17NL10 both harboring an authentic proteolytic cleavage site. after 2 d in the presence of trypsin, the cells were fixed and stained with antibodies directed to NP and either HL18 or HL17. two days after inoculation, cells were stained with antibodies directed to either HL18 (E) or HL17 (F) Error bars indicate mean and SD of three independent experiments. HL18 Mediates Infection of Polarized MDCK II Cells from the basolateral site. bp entered polarized MDCK II cells predominantly from the basolateral membrane. a similar directional infection pattern was observed with recombinant HL18NL11. apical HA localization was observed in polarized cells after infection with HL18NL11. polarized filter-grown MDCK II cells grown on transwell filter inserts were infected with either HL18NL11 (m.o.i. of 0.3) at the basolateral site for 48 h (Upper) or the conventional influenza A virus A/SC35M (H7N7) at an m.o.i. of 5 at the apical site for 8 h (Lower) the indicated z scans were taken by using a confocal laser the number of infectious foci in the cell layer was determined 2 d p.i. Error bars indicate the mean and SD of two independent experiments. we succeeded in propagating infectious HL18NL11 and HL17NL10 bat influenza A-like viruses, demonstrating that the recently identified genomic sequences encode fully infectious viruses. chimeras expressing either NL10 or NL11 instead of the VSV-G protein could be propagated on helper cells. expression of HL18 along with NL11 had no effect on viral titers. recombinant HL18NL11 viruses preferentially entered polarized cells from the basolateral site. HL18NL11 (and probably HL17NL10) resembles conventional influenza A viruses. the opposite sites of virus entry and release may explain. at least partially, why infection of the MDCK II cell monolayer with HL18NL11 was less robust than infection with conventional influenza A viruses. the nature of the cellular receptor or receptors that mediate infection of influenza A-like viruses is still unknown. sialidase treatment significantly enhanced the infection of MDCK II cells by VSV*G-HL18pb and recombinant bat influenza A-like viruses. recombinant HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 viruses revealed similarities but striking dissimilarities to conventional influenza A viruses. experimental infection of bats will certainly provide deeper insight into the tropism of the viruses in the natural host and their mode of transmission. recombinant influenza A-like viruses HL17NL10 and HL18NL11 containing authentic HL proteolytic cleavage site were handled in laboratories complying to biosafety level 2. animal trials were performed in compliance with the Swiss animal protection law and approved by the animal welfare committee of the canton of Bern.

BHK-G43 is a transgenic BHK-21 cell clone expressing the VSV G protein in a regulated manner. the cell lines were maintained as proposed by the ATCC, ECACC, and DSZM. cDNA. immune sera directed against HL17 and HL18 was produced by immunizing specific pathogen-free white Leghorn chickens with 108 FFU of VSV*G-HL17 or pVSV*G-HL18 via the intramuscular route. polyclonal NP-specific antibodies were purchased from Thermo Fischer (catalog no.
