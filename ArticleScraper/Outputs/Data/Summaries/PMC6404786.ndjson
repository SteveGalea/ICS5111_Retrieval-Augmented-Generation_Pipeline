{"summary": "antibodies are a key component of the human adaptive immune system. passive infused antibodies have been used in anti-toxin, anti-viral, and anti-inflammatory treatments. monoclonal recombinant antibodies are currently being pursued in large Phase IIb clinical trials. the surface representation of human IgG1 indicates: the Fv regions, which are the portions of the Fab arms required for antigen binding. the hinge region provides flexibility for the Fab and Fc regions. the specific receptor for IgE is FcRI, which is involved in rapid allergic responses. most Fc receptors are capable of cytoplasmic signaling. the inhibitory FcRIIb signals via an immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibition motif (ITIM) domain. low-affinity Fc receptors require multiple coordinated interactions for sufficient binding avidity. binding does not trigger signaling through its associated -chain. signaling requires receptor clustering and cross-linking. the specific receptor engagements involved in ADCP of different viruses or virus-infected cells have not been completely defined. the receptors involved will differ depending on the characteristics of the antibody forming the complex. the receptors involved will differ depending on the characteristics of the antibody forming the complex. in a comprehensive recent review by Jennewein and Alter, for IgG antibodies there are 36 possible glycoforms and 4 different subclasses. the role of glycovariation in antiviral antibody responses has yet to be defined. the role of glycovariation in antiviral antibody responses has yet to be defined. rc family tyrosine kinases (54) formed a docking site for Syk (55) and triggered a signaling cascade involving PKC (56, 57), PI3K (58\u201360), and synthesis of PI(4,5)P2, (3,4,5)-PIP3 and DAG (61). these lead to actin cytoskeleton remodeling (62), allowing the advance of the phagocytic cell over the target. colon-resident macrophages were deficient in ADCP compared to colon- and cervix-resident neutrophils as well as cervix-resident macrophages. this seminal study likely only partially defines the diversity of professional phagocytes within tissues that can be encountered by antibody-virus immune complexes. antibody-dependent phagocytosis is also important in the development and regulation of immune responses themselves. pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) derived from virus antigens can be released upon phagocytosis and digestion of antibody\u2013virus immune complexes. the role of ADCP in immune responses against viruses is complex and difficult to dissect given its association with other antibody functions in the settings of infection, vaccination, and passive immunization. forthal and collaborators (37) performed FcRIIa genotyping of a large cohort HIV-1 infected men (n = 559) brouwer et al. (36) identified infant homozygosity for the high affinity allele of FcRIIa as a risk factor for perinatal HIV-1 transmission. they observed no impact of maternal FcRIIa alleles on transmission. a similar study was conducted using samples collected from 79 HIV-1 transmitting mothers. studies based on genetic factors alone may provide insight into the potential for ADCP and other Fc receptor-dependent antibody functions to contribute to immune responses to HIV-1. other studies have helped to address some of these limitations and provide additional evidence that ADCP plays an important antiviral role against HIV-1. rhesus macaques were immunized with a DNA prime-Ad5 SIVmac239 Env-based vaccine regime. a cross study validation of the ADCP correlate was preformed. rhesus macaques were vaccinated with an ALVAC prime gp120-boost vaccine regimen. an immune correlates analysis of the partially efficacious RV144 vaccine human clinical trial provided evidence that non-neutralizing antibodies contributed to reduced risk of infection. other HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials that showed no efficacy either lacked a coordinated Fc receptor-dependent effector response (87) or lacked evidence of strong Fc-mediated antibody functions. passive immunization trials show antibody-mediated protective activity is not solely due to neutralization, but also in part due to Fc receptor-dependent functions. in non-human primate studies, antibodies with enhanced ability to bind activating Fc receptors gave greater protection than their epitope-matched counterparts. the condition was not reversed even in the presence of passively-infused anti-influenza antibodies from immune wild type mice. the effector mechanism was narrowed down by demonstrating protection after passive transfer of immune sera into CD3-transgenic mice that lack T cells and NK cells. a defect in interactions of antibody with immune effector cells caused the susceptibility. the contribution of ADCP to protection from influenza infection observed in passive immunization studies supports antibodies capable of ADCP as a desirable outcome of active immunization. the contribution of ADCP to protection from influenza infection observed in passive immunization studies. protein is highly expressed on the surface of infected cells, but limited on influenza virions. anti-M2e antibodies preferentially target influenza infected cells and eliminate them via ADCC and ADCP prior to virus propagation and release by budding. this is an understudied aspect of immune responses to all viral infections. trial of the gB/MF59 vaccine conducted in postpartum women (123, 124) found that this vaccine induced only modest neutralizing antibody responses. however, the vaccine elicited high magnitude gB-specific IgG3 responses. the vaccine elicited high magnitude gB-specific IgG3 responses. ma virus (HPV), foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and west Nile virus (WNV) evidence of ADCP in immune responses limited to in vitro assessment of virus-specific monoclonal antibodies. NK cells were not required, suggesting against ADCC as the immune mechanism involved in the reduction of infection (129). NK cells were not required, suggesting against ADCC as the immune mechanism involved in the reduction of infection. this study provides another example of ADCP contributing to the protection mediated by antibodies with the ability to neutralize virus. forthal and collaborators (37) performed FcRIIa genotyping of a large cohort HIV-1 infected men (n = 559) over 90% of whom were entered into the study prior to the availability of antiretroviral therapy. they found that homozygosity for the low affinity allele of FcRIIa (R/R131), the Fc receptor implicated in IgG-mediated ADCP activity against HIV-1. the high affinity allele for FcRIIIa (homozygous or heterozygous) were associated with a significantly lower risk of HIV-1 vertical transmission (79) many factors are likely contributing to the divergent outcomes including differential requirements for immune control of disease progression vs. infection when comparing the Forthal study to the two studies investigating vertical transmission. rhesus macaques were immunized with a DNA prime-Ad5 SIVmac239 Env-based vaccine regime, either via the intramuscular (IM) route, or intranasally in an aerosol (AE) formulation. smE660 intra-rectal challenge were observed for both the IM and AE immunization groups. unique humoral immune profiles and correlates of risk were identified. ADCP was identified as a correlate of reduced infection risk in both the IM and AE vaccine groups. RV144 vaccine regimen elicited antibodies that exhibited coordinated Fc-mediated effector responses (87, 91) other HIV-1 vaccine efficacy trials that showed no efficacy either lacked a coordinated Fc receptor-dependent effector response (87) or lacked evidence of strong Fc-mediated antibody functions (100, 101) a recent study by Parsons and collaborators showed that for the highly potent neutralizing antibody PGT121, Fc-receptor dependent functions were dispensable for maximum protection. these results suggest that the extent to which Fc receptor-dependent antibodies contribute to protection is variable, and likely dependent on multiple factors including neutralization potency. depletion of lung phagocytes, i.e., neutrophils and alveolar macrophages, caused uncontrolled growth of influenza in mice. the effector mechanism responsible for control of influenza infection by phagocytes was likely antibody-dependent, since control of infection was enhanced by passively infused antiserum (112) candidate vaccine regimens attempt to focus the immune response on highly conserved influenza antigens. results of testing such candidate vaccine regimens suggest that ADCP may be an important immune response elicited by antibodies that target conserved influenza epitopes. it remains unknown how ADCP and other Fc receptor-dependent functions contribute to persistent natural and vaccine-induced responses to seasonal influenza. many studies have implicated ADCP as having a role in immune responses to herpesvirus infections. a genetic link providing evidence of a role ADCP in immune responses to herpesviruses was described for EBV. the low affinity allele of FcRIIa was found to be enriched in EBV infection and correlated with the expression of the latency protein LMP1. this allele may be a risk factor for latent EBV infection (34) anti-HPV-specific IgG monoclonal antibodies cross vaginal epithelial at sites of local disruption. they propose that ADCP augmented protection against vaginal HPV infection resulting from virus neutralization. this is because protection was less efficacious when passive transfers were performed with Fc-deficient mice. passive antibody transfer of NS1-specific monoclonal antibodies into normal mice showed Fc receptor-dependent protection (132) the authors demonstrated that murine macrophages were able to internalize NS1-expressing target cells in the presence of anti-NS1 antibodies, suggesting that NK cell ADCC was not essential. ADE is thought to occur when non-neutralizing antibodies, or suboptimal concentrations of neutralizing antibodies, bind and opsonize virus. ADE is thought to occur when non-neutralizing antibodies, or suboptimal concentrations of neutralizing antibodies, bind and opsonize virus, and are subsequently internalized by Fc receptor expressing cells via ADCP. no enhancement of infection in the vaccine arm was observed in the VAX003 and VAX004 clinical trials, both of which elicited high levels of non-neutralizing antibodies. there is evidence of ADE for many other viruses including influenza, SARS-CoV, RSV, and ebola virus. chimeric antibodies with mouse Fv and human Fc regions showed a similar epitope-dependent dichotomy of anti-hemagglutinin antibody responses in antiviral assays performed with neutrophils as the source of innate effector cells. similar observations were made for antibodies made both as IgG1 and as IgA. ebola virus envelope glycoprotein is similar to the envelope fusion glycoproteins of influenza and HIV-1 in that they share a common architecture of trimers of dimeric proteins. the dimers are comprised of a distal receptor-binding head region and a membrane-bound stem/stalk region. neutralizing epitopes such as the gp41 principal immunodominant domain (stem region), V1/V2 loop and V3 loop (gp120 head region) are also targets of ADCP antibodies. the ability of these epitopes to be engaged for phagocytosis varies by strain, indicating the substantial heterogeneity between viruses. virion ADCP methods do not differentiate between infectious and non-infectious virion particles. an open question remains whether non-neutralizing antibodies do indeed cause uptake of infectious viruses. the epitope specificities involved for each process may differ, given different epitope exposure on viruses and infected cells. antibodies that target other epitope regions are capable of ADCP activity but have not yet been identified. there is a dearth of knowledge regarding specific epitopes that can be targeted by ADCP antibodies against most viruses. fluorescence-based approaches are the most popular due to the capability to quantify target particles. the target particle could be a live fluorescently-labeled virion (104, 120, 166) or a virus-derived protein conjugated to a fluorescent bead (120, 162) in fluorescence-based approaches, the target particle could be a live fluorescently-labeled virion (104, 120, 166) or a virus-derived protein conjugated to a fluorescent bead (120, 162). fluorescence labels can be engineered to report internalization. current assays do not routinely measure the size of the immune complex engulfed, but only the number of intracellular or intravesicular virions. it is not even clear whether antibody-dependent virion internalization is strictly a process of phagocytosis, or whether other processes including endocytosis and macropinocytosis are involved. trogocytosis is another potential outcome of Fc-dependent interactions between antibodies and virus-infected cells. two assays developed to measure HIV/SIV-specific ADCC responses have been shown to also detect antibody-mediated interactions between monocytes and virus-infected or protein-coated cells. differences are apparent when comparing IgA and IgG subclasses between rhesus macaques and humans. rhesus macaques have only one IgA gene, whereas humans have two IgA genes, IgA1 and IgA2. diversity in germline immunoglobulin genes is higher in rhesus macaques than in humans. vaccine-elicited HIV-specific IgG3 was identified as a correlate of reduced risk of infection in the RV144 clinical trial. in vitro studies have demonstrated higher ADCP activity for IgG3 HIV monoclonal antibodies compared to other IgG subclasses. rhesus macaques do not use IgG subclasses to tune antibody responses. rhesus macaques are more polymorphic than human Fc receptors. antibody binding to FcRIIa is different between humans and rhesus macaques. receptor genes have been deleted and human Fc receptor transgenes have been inserted. this results in mice that express functional human Fc receptors on the same types of cells and at the same levels as found in humans. the primary limitations of this model are that only human Fc receptors are expressed. author contributions MT and JP conceived and wrote the manuscript. authors declare that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
