{"summary": "coronavirus 5\u2032 untranslated region and its adjacent nonstructural protein 1 coding region function well together. these components work poorly or not at all. this finding enhances an understanding of cis-acting viral replication elements. a gatekeeper kinase can enforce a latent viral state even in the presence of high levels of NF-B activity. this kinase pathway could offer a new therapeutic target for future HIV-1 reactivating drugs. oHSV enhances viral replication while attenuating the antiviral innate immune response. as the fraction of CCR5-expressing CD4+ T cells increases with age, these results may explain the paucity of vertical transmission in AGMs and other nonhuman primate species."}
