{"summary": "many frontline HCWs had a significantly increased risk of contracting the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) that resulted in severe illness and death [2]. despite existing safety protocols, the magnitude of the risk of acquiring an infectious disease through some patient care procedures is not clearly understood. high risk aerosol generating procedures performed on patients with suspected respiratory infection appeared to be associated with a low risk to HCWs who were in direct contact with the patients in the operating room [11] the current evidence-based guidelines [5]\u2013[7], [12]\u2013[17] recommend additional infection control measures be taken for specified aerosol generating procedures performed on patients with suspected respiratory infection. this includes performing aerosol generating procedures in a single room with a minimal number of personnel present. parallel searches were run in PubMed, Cochrane Library, LILACS, Indian Medlars and index Medicus for South East Asia. methodological filters were applied to limit retrieval to health technology assessments, systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, non-randomized studies, and guidelines. non-invasive ventilation included endotracheal intubation, airway suctioning, high frequency oscillatory ventilation, bag-valve mask ventilation, chest physiotherapy, nebulizer therapies, aerosol humidification, bronchoscopy, and open thoracotomy. an independent third reviewer was available to determine final study selection in instances where consensus could not be reached. sensitivity analysis on treatment effect was performed using review manager software. effect sizes were reported as odds ratio (OR) and its 95% confidence interval (CI) selection criteria Eligible studies included health technology assessments (HTAs), systematic reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and non-randomized studies. results of interest were the risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections from patients to HCWs. study characteristics included information about the origin of the study, the period of evaluation, the population, types of laboratory tests to confirm the diseases, and assessment of training and protection equipment use. the outcome of interest was the risk of transmission of acute respiratory infections from patients to HCWs. four studies were carried out in Canada, [25]\u2013[27], [29] one in Singapore, [23] and five in china, [20]\u2013[22], [24]\u2013[26] included more than 100 HCWs. most studies assessed whether HCWs had proper infection control training or wore personal protective equipment while caring for patients with SARS.

(2010) [25]. four studies were carried out in Canada, [25]\u2013[27], [29] one in Singapore, [23] and five in china, [20]\u2013[22], [24], [24], [24], [28] and four studies included less than 100 HCWs. most studies assessed whether HCWs had proper infection control training or wore personal protective equipment while caring for patients with SARS. three hospitals 2002\u20132003 SARS outbreak in Beijing and Tianjin 443 HCWs (doctors, nurses, technicians, administrators, others) Yes Not mentioned of methods to detect antibodies against SARS-CoV VERY LOW Pei et al, 2006 [21] China Case-control study. the results of GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) categorized all ten studies as providing very low quality evidence. Table 2 shows the risks of SARS transmission to HCWs exposed and not exposed to AGPs, and AGPs as risk factors for SARS transmission. 61.4% 9.2 (4.2, 20.2) [21] 8.0 (3.9, 16.6) [20] 9.3 (2.9, 30.2) [24] Suction before intubation (2 cohort studies) 13.8 (1.2, 161.7) [27] 3.5 (0.5, 24.6); 59.2% 1.7 (0.7, 4.2) [25] Suction after intubation (2 cohort studies) 0.6 (0.1, 3.0) [27] 1.3 (0.5, 3.4); 28.8% four cohort studies [25]\u2013[27] showed that HCWs performing or being exposed to a tracheal intubation procedure had a higher risk of disease transmission compared with unexposed HCWs (Table 2). four case-control studies [20], [21], [23], [24] identified tracheal intubation as a significant risk factor for transmission of SARS to HCWs. tracheal intubation was an independent risk factor for acquisition of SARS based on results obtained using multivariate analysis. two cohort studies reported some risks associated with nebulizer treatment exposure. the latter study showed that medical students performing bedside clinical assessment had an increased risk of SARS infection even before nebulizer therapy was used. compressions from one case control study [24] were found to be a risk factor for transmission. but this finding was in contradistinction to the findings from the pooled estimate from two cohort studies. some procedures potentially capable of generating aerosols have been associated with increased risk of SARS transmission to HCWs. non-invasive ventilation (two studies) and manual ventilation before intubation and tracheotomy, each from single studies, were not considered sufficiently robust to establish the risk of transmission with any certainty. the findings were identified from a very limited number of studies and the data from these studies were not considered sufficiently robust. the number of HCWs included in the studies was small, ranging from 2 to 120. the sample size of the studies could potentially bias estimates of effects and limit statistical power. not all HCWs caring for SARS patients were included in the studies. tracheotomy, non-invasive ventilation, and manual ventilation before intubation were associated with an increased risk of SARS transmission. there were no other procedures which were found to be significantly associated with a risk of SARS transmission."}
