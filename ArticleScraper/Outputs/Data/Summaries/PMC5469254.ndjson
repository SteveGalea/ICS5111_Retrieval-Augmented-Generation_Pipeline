{"summary": "nef mutant (Nef) virus preferentially infects CD4+ T cells in mucosal and systemic immune tissues during primary infection (1, 2). phenotypically and functionally distinct subsets include cells classified as Th1, Th2, Th17, follicular T helper (Tfh) and T regulatory (Treg) cells (3). each subset produces distinct cytokines for specialized helper and/or regulatory functions. rhesus macaques with a quintuple deglycosylation mutant (5G) possesses novel properties. 5G replicated in vivo robustly and to similar levels as SIVmac239. infection with 5G conferred significant protection against challenge infection. we studied the expression of CXCR3 chemokines in an effort to elucidate the mechanisms that enable SIVmac239, but not 5G, to target CD4+ T cells in SLOs. Flow cytometric analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from SIVmac239-infected animals and uninfected control animals. the frequencies of CXCR3-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in uninfected, SIVmac239-infected, and 5G-infected animals were analyzed at 7 days (1 week [1w] and 21 days (3 weeks [3w]) p.i. by flow cytometry. transcriptome analyses demonstrated abundant expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs), antiviral factors, and pattern recognition receptors. 5G infection upregulated the expression of most of genes in G1, G2 and G3. these results indicated that the two viruses induced distinct host responses. this may be due to differences in the targeting of different subsets of CD4+ T cells. several studies have reported that SIV/HIV infection elicits robust innate immune responses highlighted by the expression of a number of genes. a number of ISGs were upregulated in PBMC samples obtained on day 7 p.i. from both SIVmac239- and 5G-infected animals. levels of expression of approximately 75% (17/23) of genes were 1.4- to 3.6-fold (mean, 2.4-fold) higher in PBMCs from SIV uninfected animals 5G-infected vs uninfected animals Fold changeb P value Fold change P value Fold change P value Fold change P value Fold change P value IFNB1 2.84 2.26E02 IFITM3 4.46 3.13E06 3.38 1.06E04 STAT1 5.65 2.64E05 3.66 2.38E06 RSAD2 2.82 2.23E02 69.07 1.71E07 24.52 1.39E05 MX1 2.00 1.57 all genes with the exception of IFNB1 belonged to group 5 as determined by hierarchical clustering analyses of transcriptome analysis data. IFNB1 belonged to group 5 as determined by hierarchical clustering analyses of transcriptome analysis data. the differences in expression levels of APOBEC3s, TRIMs, and BST2 between the two groups were less than 2-fold. the genes that distinguish the responses to acute infection with 5G from those with SIVmac239 exhibit inherent differences in the sensing of viral nucleic acids. expression levels of these genes were 2- to 3-fold higher in SIVmac239-infected animals than in 5G-infected animals. innate responses mediated by ISGs, antiretroviral host factors, and sensing viral nucleic acids occurred similarly during early acute infection in SIVmac239- and 5G-infected animals. expression levels of these genes were significantly activated but only in PBMCs from SIVmac239-infected animals. differences in expression levels were mostly similar to those observed for ISGs, antiretroviral host factors, and nucleic acid sensors. expression levels of CXCL10 and CXCL11 were exceptionally high (10.3- and 7.1-fold, respectively) in PBMCs from SIVmac239-infected animals compared with those in PBMCs from 5G-infected animals. GADD45A, GADD45B, GADD45G, and STAT4 genes have been reported to be involved in the differentiation and/or function of Th1 cells. these genes might be involved in the downregulation of immune responses in 5G-infected animals but not in SIVmac239-infected animals. levels of IFN- expression were significantly higher in cells from 5G-infected animals than those from SIVmac239-infected animals. expression levels of select chemokine/chemokine receptor genes were markedly higher in SIVmac239-infected animals than in 5G-infected animals. genes clustered in the upper rows were expressed at higher levels in PBMCs from 5G-infected animals than in uninfected animals. genes clustered in the middle rows of Fig. 2F included genes encoding CXCL10 and CXCL11 (predominantly associated with a Th1 response) we also noted upregulation in the expression of CX3CR1 in SIVmac239-infected animals. we hypothesized that this cell lineage may have an important role during the early stages of primary infection.

CD14+ CD16+ (A), CD14dim CD16+ (B) and CD14+ monocytes (C) populations are shown as percentages of total monocytes. the highest levels were detected in macrophages in the mesenteric and inguinal LNs and in the spleen at 9 and 12 days p.i. in inguinal LNs from infected animals. highest levels were detected in macrophages and were 5- to 23-fold higher in SIVmac239-infected animals than in 5G-infected animals. expression was analyzed in cell lineages isolated by flow cytometry (D) prior to (0 days) and 9 to 12 days p.i. in mesenteric (A) and inguinal (B) LNs, lineages consisted of CD14+ and CD14 macrophages (14+ M and 14 M, respectively) only CD14+ macrophages were markedly more abundant in SIVmac239-infected animals than in 5G-infected and uninfected animals. frequencies of the CD14+ subsets (CD14+ CD16 and CD14dim CD16+ cells) were significantly higher in SIVmac239-infected animals. MAC387+ macrophages were shown as recently infiltrated to play key roles in inflammatory responses in SIV encephalitis (41) we previously reported that MAC387+ macrophages accumulate in regions adjacent to high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the paracortex of LNs from SIVmac239-infected animals during primary infection (42). MAC387+ CD11b++ macrophages are CD14+ and frequencies of MAC387+ CD11b++ cells in mononuclear cells were 0.03 to 0.14 (percent in mononuclear cells; mean, 0.05), 0.60 to 1.29 (mean, 0.81), and 0.08 to 0.08 (mean, 0.08 to 0.21), 0.48 to 1.88 (mean, 1.02), and 0.10 to 0.56 (mean, 0.30), respectively. the frequencies in 5G-infected animals decreased between 9 and 12 to uninfected animals include Mm0127, Mm0308, and Mm0407. uninfected animals include Mm0403 (7), Mm0406 (9), Mm0519 (9), Mm0914 (11), Mm0405 (12); 5G-infected animals include Mm0306 (9), Mm0401 (9), Mm0624 (12), Mm0625 (12) and Mm0402 (14). distinctly higher expression levels of CXCL10 in SIVmac239-infected animals were associated with increased abundance of MAC387+ macrophages. this suggests that they have a role in the innate/inflammatory responses and the infection of CD4+ T cells in SLOs. the frequencies of CXCR3-expressing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were analyzed at 7 days (1 week [1w] and 21 days [3w] p.i. by flow cytometry. transcriptome analyses demonstrated abundant expression of interferon (IFN)-stimulated genes (ISGs), antiviral factors, and pattern recognition receptor (PRRs) RNAs from the PBMCs of the SIV-infected and the uninfected animals (n = 6 each) were subjected to a rhesus macaque microarray. heat maps show relative levels of gene expression normalized to the mean expression level of the controls (uninfected animals) several studies have reported that SIV/HIV infection elicits robust innate immune responses highlighted by the expression of a number of genes. a number of ISGs were upregulated in PBMC samples obtained on day 7 p.i. from both SIVmac239- and 5G-infected animals. levels of expression of approximately 75% (17/23) of genes were 1.4- to 3.6-fold (mean, 2.4-fold) higher in PBMCs from SIV ected animals 5G-infected vs uninfected animals Fold changeb P value Fold change P value Fold change P value Fold change P value IFNB1 2.84 2.26E02 IFITM3 4.46 3.13E06 3.38 1.06E04 STAT1 5.65 2.64E05 3.66 2.38E06 RSAD2 2.82 2.23E02 69.07 1.71E07 24.52 1.39E05 MX1 2.00 1.57E02 18.90 4.14 all genes with the exception of IFNB1 belonged to group 5 as determined by hierarchical clustering analyses of transcriptome analysis data.

MAC387+ macrophages were shown as recently infiltrated to play key roles in inflammatory responses in SIV encephalitis (41) we previously reported that MAC387+ macrophages accumulate in regions adjacent to high endothelial venules (HEVs) in the paracortex of LNs from SIVmac239-infected animals during primary infection (42). MAC387+ CD11b++ macrophages are CD14+ and the numbers in panels A and B are the frequencies (%) of MAC387+ CD11b++ macrophages in mononuclear cells. the frequencies in uninfected, SIVmac239-infected, and 5G-infected animals were 0.03 to 0.14 (percent in mononuclear cells; mean, 0.05), 0.60 to 1.29 (mean, 0.81), and 0.08 to 0.08 (mean, 0.06), respectively. uninfected animals include Mm0127, Mm0308, and Mm0407. uninfected animals include Mm0403 (7), Mm0406 (9), Mm0519 (9), Mm0914 (11), Mm0405 (12); 5G-infected animals include Mm0306 (9), Mm0401 (9), Mm0624 (12), Mm0625 (12) and Mm0402 (14). inflammatory responses play a key role in the pathogenesis of HIV infection. infections with live-attenuated primate lentiviruses elicit lower inflammatory responses and levels of T cell activation than those with pathogenic SIV. studies of genome-wide transcriptomes revealed that infection with SIVmac239 elicits distinctly stronger inflammatory immune responses than infection with 5G. such responses activate Th1 cells via robust expression of CXCR3 chemokines, especially CXCL10, the expression of which paralleled viral loads. inflammatory tissues such as MAC387+ macrophages (M) secrete inflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as CXCL10, CXCR3+ T cells and other inflammatory cells accumulate at the inflammation sites. as a result, preferential infections of CCR5+ CXCR3+ CD4+ T cells cause depletion of functional Th1 cells required for a cellular immune response to contain the infection. peripheral blood monocytes consist of CD14+ CD16 (>80%), CD14dim CD16+ (5 to 10%), and CD14+ CD16+ (5%) cells. these subsets exert distinct functions and play important roles in the defense against microbial infections and sterile inflammations. very few MAC387+ macrophages were in SLOs from 5G-infected animals. this suggests that various live-attenuated SIVs and HIV controllers have similarly low levels of MAC387+ macrophages in SLOs. most CD4+ T cells in the paracortex are central memory or naive cells. levels of the reservoirs appear to inversely correlate with set point viral loads or containment of the infection following primary infection. recent studies demonstrated that Tfh cells are reservoirs in elite controllers of SIV infection and in HIV-infected patients with undetectable viral loads by combination antiretroviral therapy (59) 79, 146, 171, 460, and 479 in gp120 were replaced with glutamine residues (12) stocks of SIVmac239 and 5G were then prepared by transfection of proviral DNAs into 293T cells. rhesus macaques were screened and found negative for SIV, simian T cell lymphotropic virus, herpes B virus, and type D retrovirus.
