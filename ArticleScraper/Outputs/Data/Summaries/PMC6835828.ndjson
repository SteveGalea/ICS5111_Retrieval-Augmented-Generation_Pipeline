{"summary": "our immune system comprises a complex network of cells, tissues, and organs that work in harmony to protect the body against deadly diseases. diseases are caused by malfunctioning or underperforming immune response; an over-reactive immune system can cause autoimmunity. an underactive immune system can make our body more susceptible to infection. aluminum adjuvant is co-administered with antigen to enhance immune response. aluminum adjuvants fail to generate strong cell-mediated immunity. other adjuvants include Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant, Quil A.
