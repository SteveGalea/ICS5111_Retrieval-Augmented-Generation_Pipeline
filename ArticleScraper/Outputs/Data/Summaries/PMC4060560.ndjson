{"summary": "intracranial infection of susceptible mice with the JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (JHMV) causes acute encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease. inflammatory virus-specific T cells are efficient in controlling viral replication through the secretion of IFN- and cytolytic activity. PMNs have been shown to enhance central nervous system (CNS) inflammation by disrupting blood brain barrier (BBB) integrity in animal models of spinal cord injury. blocking or silencing of CXCR2 signaling mutes inflammation and tissue damage. 1 and CXCL2 are upregulated within the acutely infected CNS. expression was localized to astrocytes (GFAP-positive) within the parenchyma. expression of the CXCR2 ligands closely paralleled neutrophil emergency release into the circulation and infiltration into the CNS. mice treated with either CXCR2 antiserum or control serum were incapable of controlling viral replication. permeabilization of the blood-brain barrier was impaired. inflammatory cell infiltration was significantly reduced. neutrophils are critical for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (TMEV)- and pilocarpine-induced BBB permeabilization and subsequent seizures. neutrophils are also critical for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (TMEV)- and pilocarpine-induced BBB permeabilization. chemokine receptor signaling promotes oligodendroglia survival during chronic JHMV-induced demyelination. many resident cell types of the CNS express chemokine receptors under non-inflammatory and inflammatory conditions. mRNA transcripts for CXCR2 as well as its ligands CXCL1 and CXCL2 are significantly upregulated, persisting until at least 21 days pi within the spinal cord. spinal cords from anti-CXCR2 treated mice showed significantly greater areas of demyelination. mRNA for CXCR2, CXCL1 and CXCL2 are upregulated within the spinal cords of JHMV infected mice. cultured oligodendroglia were infected with JHMV in vitro. western blotting confirmed activated caspase 3, activated caspase 3, PARP, Bcl-2, and actin expression. oligodendrocytes readily underwent apoptosis (Figure 2G) data suggest that CXCR2 prevents oligodendrocyte apoptosis and promotes clinical recovery from viral induced demyelination. the role for CXCR2 signaling during EAE and a variety of toxin\u2014induced demyelination models has also been studied. our research on chemokines and chemokine receptors has revealed important roles for these molecules in orchestrating CNS inflammation in response to JHMV infection. it will be important to analyze the effects of selectively ablating CXCR2 on oligodendroglia during JHMV-induced demyelination."}
