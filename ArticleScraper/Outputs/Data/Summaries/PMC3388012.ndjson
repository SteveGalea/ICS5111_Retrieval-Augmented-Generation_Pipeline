{"summary": "genomes from other Mtb strains and closely related bacteria present an opportunity to apply the power of comparative genomics to understand the evolution of Mtb pathogenesis. results highlight the functional importance of lipid metabolism and its regulation, and reveal variation between the evolutionary profiles of genes implicated in saturated and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism. the sequence of the pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) strain H37Rv has been available for a decade [2,3], but the biology of the pathogen remains poorly understood. available genome sequences from Mtb strains present an opportunity to bring the power of comparative genomics to the study of Mtb. the labels A-C indicate the branches selected for further analysis in our dN/dS analysis. see Methods for details on the phylogenetic tree construction. mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis K-10 Y Y Causes paratuberculosis; obligate pathogen of cattle; degrades PAH [14] Mycobacterium smegmatis MC2155 Y Widely used model for Mtb isolated from human smegma; causes soft tissue lesions; degrades PAH [14] Mycobacterium vanbaalenii PYR-1 Soil bacteria we also included a related Rhodococcus, a pathogenic Nocardia, four Corynebacteria, two Streptomyces, Acidothermus cellulolyticus, Propionibacterium acnes and Bifidobacterium longum. our analysis also suggests that DNA repair and molybdopterin cofactors are expanded in pathogenic Mycobacteria and Mtb. orthogroups are defined as the set of genes descended from a single common ancestral gene in the last common ancestor of the species under consideration [28], containing both orthologs and possibly paralogs. at each node in the phylogenetic tree, we tabulated orthogroup appearances, duplications, and losses. PFAM and GO categories most expanded (with the most orthogroup members) in the Mtb clade relative to the non-pathogenic Mycobacteria. Tables 4 and 5 show those most expanded in the Mycobacteria relative to the non-Mycobacteria.

Desulfovibrio desulfuricans intestinal strains contain a higher ratio of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids than soil strains of Desulfovibrio desulfuricans. genes upregulated by at least 1.5 standard deviations are indicated here. lipid degradation gene families are more expanded in the soil-dwelling Mycobacteria than in the pathogens. the soil-dwellers have the unusual ability to degrade a vast array of compounds, including diverse lipids. lipid biosynthesis and lipid degradation pathways are specialized within the pathogenic Mycobacteria. KstR appears to have evolved at the last common ancestor of the Mycobacteria and Rhodococcus. however, in organisms more distantly related to Mtb, the KstR gene is not present in a single copy. a subset of KstR binding sites are the most conserved of any noncoding sequence we identified. the conservation of the KstR gene and binding sites is mirrored in the conservation of KstR binding sites across numerous promoters. a subset of KstR binding sites are the most conserved of any noncoding sequence. several of the genes in this set with highest dN/dS values are known DNA repair genes (including recA, recB, and dnaE2). recA has the highest dN/dS score of all the genes in Mtb on the branch leading to the Mtb complex, and recB also has a very high score. genes involved in first steps of pterin cofactor biosynthesis are known to be expanded in the Mtb complex [50] genes related to molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis have been shown to be upregulated under conditions of stress in Mtb [52] moa3 is present with varying frequency in the RD1 region. domains related to pterin cofactor biosynthesis among the top protein domains expanded in the Mtb complex compared to the non-pathogenic Mycobacteria. some of these gene copies are believed to have been acquired by lateral gene transfer on the branch leading to the pathogenic Mycobacteria. rG and LppX were found to be in vivo essential genes by TraSH analysis [56]. phylogenetic footprinting provides a powerful approach for identifying functional noncoding sequences. the organisms being analyzed must be sufficiently distant such that non-functional elements have diverged. we used a combination of comparative genomics, RNA-seq, and experimental validation by Northern blotting to identify additional sRNAs in Mtb that have not been previously reported. it is likely that additional conserved regions are expressed under other diverse conditions. green signifies reads from the negative strand, yellow shows the total reads. the multiple alignment is shown on the bottom (darker grey signifies a higher degree of conservation; red signifies no alignment at that position). the rulers at the top show the gene structure.

PF07161 contains four lipoproteins (LprF, LprG, LprA, LppX) novel putative conserved small noncoding RNAs in Mycobacteria Small noncoding RNAs (sRNAs) have been shown to play a role in regulating gene expression in numerous bacterial species [59], including Streptococcus [60,61]. but only recently were sRNAs reported in mycobacteria [60,62]. new predicted RNAs are shown in the RNA-seq data. the tan bar shows the conserved region predicted by Gumby. the green bar shows the region predicted to fold by Evofold. 35c (secreted protein) Rv1436 (GAPDH) 756567 756626 100 626 RNA24 1374224 --- 46 567 30071 Y Rv1230c (membrane prot.)

Phylip's SEQBOOT was used to create 1000 bootstrap input replicates for each tree. EFICAZ [90] was used to assign EC numbers for proteins in all 31 organisms. category-level phylogenetic profiles are the sum of its component orthogroup-level phylogenetic profiles. the webpage for each category contains a link to other categories with similar phylogenetic profiles. categories with the most similar profiles were obtained by calculating Euclidean distances to all other profiles. many of the top categories are lipid metabolism-related categories expanded in the Mycobacteria. we compared both the Mtb complex and a group consisting of other pathogenic Mycobacteria to the set of soil-dwelling Mycobacteria. we compiled lists of PFAM categories, including those that do not make the strict Bonferroni-corrected p-value cutoff. many potentially interesting expansions do not make the overly conservative Bonferroni-corrected p-value cutoff [95,96] motifs of interest were selected by applying a set of filters. specificity score [77], quality of alignment (AlignACE MAP score) [97], palindromicity [77], and conservation. each of the other genomes was searched with this search matrix. each category is shown in parentheses. we extracted a list of genes upregulated 1.5 and 2 standard deviations above the mean. for each category, we considered a gene to be upregulated if it was upregulated in more than 50% of the experiments making up that category. we used a \"branch model\" where a different dN/dS value is allowed on a \"foreground\" branch. for each of the three foreground branches, we used a Bonferroni correction equal to the number of orthogroups present at the branch. we compared this model to the basic model using a log-likelihood 2 test with d.o.f. = 1. model using a log-likelihood 2 test with d.o.f. = 1 [100] was the most informative. we calculated the functional group over-representations separately for each functional group dataset. a rearrangement or loss of detectable similarity in any genome will truncate the block for all member genomes. we then ran the multiple aligner MLAGAN on each block. to facilitate searches for constrained regions, we projected the blocks onto the reference genome. we calculated RPKM [108] values for each of these regions. we examined the regions with RPKM value 200 and a number of RNA-seq reads 20. we eliminated an additional 35 regions which corresponded to known RNAs from the Mtb annotation.

Phylip's CONSENSE was used to create 1000 bootstrap input replicates. EFICAZ was used to assign EC numbers for proteins in all 31 organisms. categories with the most similar profiles were obtained by calculating Euclidean distances to all other profiles. instances of expanded or missing pathways across the 31 organisms will have non-uniform pathway-level phylogenetic profiles. we ranked categories by this separation to find bimodal categories. related categories expanded in the Mycobacteria. compared both the Mtb complex and a group of other pathogenic Mycobacteria to the set of soil-dwelling Mycobacteria. ferroni-corrected by number of PFAM domains represented in that set of organisms. we compiled lists of those that are most expanded and a list of those most contracted across these pairings. many potentially interesting expansions do not make the overly conservative Bonferroni-corrected p-value cutoff [95,96] motifs of interest were selected by applying a set of filters. specificity score [77], quality of alignment (AlignACE MAP score) [97], palindromicity [77], and conservation. each of the other genomes was searched with this search matrix. onic and Eicosatetraynoic acids (76), Linoleic acid (41), Eicosatetraynoic acid (13), Ceramide (4), Nordihydroguaiaretic (3), Cholesterol (2), Glucose (1), KstR knockout with cholesterol added (1). within each experiment, we extracted a list of genes upregulated 1.5 and 2 standard deviations above the mean. for each category, we considered a gene to be upregulated branch-site models allow dN/dS to vary across branches of the tree and among sites in the protein. we compared this model to the basic model using a log-likelihood 2 test with d.o.f. = 1. the branch-site model was the most informative. we calculated the functional group over-representations separately for each functional group dataset. these datasets included 21 COG categories, 168 KEGG categories, 749 metabolic pathways, and 7 additional Mycobacteria-specific groupings. a multiple alignment of all 19 Mycobacteria genomes identified 4697 regions of conservation overlapping coding genes in the reference annotation. 394 regions in intergenic regions were concatenated in a new multiple alignment only containing third bases. we calculated RPKM [108] values for each of these regions. we examined the regions with RPKM value 200 and a number of RNA-seq reads 20. we eliminated 35 regions which corresponded to known RNAs from the Mtb annotation.
