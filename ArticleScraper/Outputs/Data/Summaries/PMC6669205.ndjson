{"summary": "PEDV is a large, enveloped virus with a 5\u2032 capped, single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome of approximately 28 kb, with a 3\u2032 polyadenylated tail. first two large ORFs comprise two-thirds of the genome and encode the replicase polyproteins, 1a and 1ab. last one-third encodes four canonical coronavirus structural proteins in a fixed order, spike (S), membrane (M), in the united states and rapidly spread to the adjacent North and South American countries, causing significant financial losses to their swine industries [9,10,11] the US prototype-like highly virulent G2b PEDV strains almost simultaneously invaded multiple Asian nations, including south Korea, Taiwan, and Japan, resulting in a massive nationwide PED epizootic [5,12,13]. the attenuated virus used to prepare the MLV vaccine can replicate to high titer in the gut and boost lactogenic immune responses without giving rise to clinical illnesses. in general, the attenuated virus can be achieved by cell culture adaptation procedures of the virulent wild-type virus in non-host cell lines. PEDV N protein-specific monoclonal antibody (MAb) was obtained from ChoongAng Vaccine Laboratories (CAVAC; Korea) cold adaptation of PEDV The PEDV strain, Aram-P5, was plaque-purified twice in Vero cells, and the purified virus was serially passaged in Vero cells. culture supernatants were collected 48 h post-infection (hpi) titers were measured by end-point titration in 96-well plates. the 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) per mL of virus stock was calculated using the Reed and Muench method [25] nucleotide sequence analyses The full-length genomic sequences of the parental Aram-P5 and cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA strains were determined by rapid a piglet challenge trials were conducted to determine the infectious dose and virulence of a PEDV Aram strain using 3-day-old conventional suckling piglets delivered from commercial crossbred sows. piglets were inoculated orally with 1 mL of 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 dilutions of the Aram-P5 virus at 5 days of age. piglets were immunized orally with a 1 mL dose of 104.5 TCID50/mL of each virus or sham inoculated with cell culture medium. animals were fed commercial milk replacer frequently (4 times daily) and had ad libitum access to water for the duration of the study (9 days). the sham-inoculated pigs were administered cell culture medium as a placebo. animals were monitored daily for clinical signs of vomiting, diarrhea, and mortality throughout the experiment. piglets were necropsied upon death after challenge throughout the study. the remaining sows in groups 2 and 3 were unvaccinated and served as controls. all sows were allowed to farrow naturally and nurse their piglets freely. animals were observed daily for clinical signs, including vomiting, diarrhea, and mortality. small intestinal tissue specimens ( 3-mm thick) collected from each piglet were fixed with 10% formalin for 24 h at RT. the formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues were cut in 5\u20138-m thick sections on a microtome. the deparaffinized intestinal tissue sections were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. all statistical significances were evaluated by a Student's t-test. p values of less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant. cells, virus, and antibody Vero cells (ATCC CCL-81) were cultured in alpha minimum medium. the inoculated cells were maintained at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO2. when 70% of the cells showed CPE, the cells were subjected to three rounds of freezing and thawing. the clarified supernatants were stored at 80\u00b0C as a viral stock. full-length genomic sequences of the parental Aram-P5 and cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA strains were determined by traditional Sanger methods. overlapping cDNA fragments spanning the entire genome of each virus strain were amplified and sequenced as described elsewhere. the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the genome of each virus strain were determined by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) as described elsewhere. thirty pigs were divided into six groups (group 1\u2013group 6) of five animals. animals in groups 1\u20136 were allowed to acclimate for two days and then inoculated orally with 1 mL of 102, 103, 104, 105, and 106 dilutions. after inoculation, piglets were observed daily for clinical signs, including diarrhea and mortality. animals were immunized orally with a 1 mL dose of 104.5 TCID50/mL of each virus or sham inoculated with cell culture medium. pre-immune sera were collected at the immunization, and antisera were collected at 1 week intervals for 3 weeks. animals were randomly assigned to three experimental groups: the parental Aram-P5-inoculated (n = 4), cold-adapted P29-CA-inoculated piglets were necropsied upon death after challenge throughout the study. surviving pigs from the challenge and control groups were euthanized at 7 DPI for post-mortem examinations. fecal specimens were taken from all groups and examined for PEDV shedding. a CSS was determined for 7 days post-challenge (DPC) as described above. blood samples were collected from sows before (at each vaccination), at, after farrowing (up to 2 weeks) and also from 5 representative piglets per litter from each dam. PEDV antigen detection was measured using an MAb specific for PEDV N protein as described previously [23,24] the presence of PEDV-specific neutralizing antibodies in serum and colostrum samples was determined using a serum neutralization (SN) test. the neutralization titer was calculated as the reciprocal of the highest dilution of serum that inhibited virus-specific CPE in duplicate wells. growth kinetics analysis indicated that Aram replicated efficiently in vero cells. PEDV-specific CPE was observed daily, and cells were photographed at 24 hpi using an inverted microscope at a magnification of 200. phacoronaviruses consisting of the 292-nt 5\u2032 UTR, the 20345-nt ORF1a/1b, the 4152-nt ORF3 (nt 20634 to 24785), the 231-nt E gene (nt 25438 to 25668), the 681-nt membrane (M) gene (nt 25676 to 26356), the 1326-nt N gene (nt 26368 to 2769 the Aram strains were classified as G2b, sharing 97.4%\u201399.2% aa identity with the global G2b strains, but only having 91.3%\u201392.7% and 94.6%\u201395.3% aa homology with the classical G1a or variant G1b strains. however, it was genetically distinct from the G1a strains, showing relatively low nt identity. two discontinuous 4-aa and 1-aa insertions at positions 55/56 and 135/136 and one 2-aa DEL at positions 160 and 161 within S compared to the prototype CV777 strain. an alternative TAA stop codon (boldface) and a premature termination (asterisk) in nucleotide sequences of ORF3 are also indicated. each group (groups 1\u20135) of five piglets was challenged orally with the 10-fold serially diluted (102\u2013106) Aram-P5 virus. control animals in group 6 were fed cell culture medium. by 3 DPI, 100% pigs of group 1, 60% (3/5) pigs of groups 2 and 3 and 20% (1/5) pigs of group 4 died from PED-related clinical signs. cold-adapted PEDV Aram-CA strains were generated by a serial passage of Aram-P5 at low temperatures starting from 37\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C. antisera were collected from the pigs at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-week after oral administration of each virus and were tested for neutralizing activity against the Aram isolate. piglets at 3 weeks of age were inoculated orally with each cold-adapted Aram-CA strain. the serum samples were collected at the indicated time points and were tested by virus neutralization assay using Aram-P5. the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032- UTRs of the cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA strain were also completely conserved in S and ORF3 of the cold-adapted virus. the coding region contained a total of 16 nt substitutions, causing changes of 1-aa in nsp3, 7-aa in S, 1-aa in E, and 2-aa in M. o acid P5 P29-CA ORF1a nsp3 4007 1336 GAT (D) GGT (G) nsp5 9625 3209 ATT (F) ORF2 S 5 2 AGG (R) AAG (K) 628 209 AAC (N) TAC (Y) 1120 374 GTG (V) TTG (L) 1314 438 ATA (I) ATG (M) 2320 774 ACG (T all piglets were active, showed no clinical symptoms, and had normal fecal consistency that did not contain any PEDV genetic material. the cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA virus-inoculated piglets in group 1 finally died by 5 DPI. fecal shedding of PEDV was detected in all the piglets in group 2 by 1 DPI with the mean Ct values of 24.59 (103.11 TCID50/mL), but thereafter decreased to the lowest levels thereafter followed by a slight increase at 5 DPI. negative control piglets remained active without the onset of diarrhea and PEDV fecal shedding throughout the experimental period. small intestines from all dead piglets in group 1 were characterized by acute viral enteritis, with villous shortening and fusion, involving vacuolation of superficial epithelial cells. two out of four cold-adapted virus-inoculated pigs in group 2 showed mild villous atrophy. jejunums from piglets infected with the virulent Aram-P5 strain showed acute diffuse, severe atrophic enteritis with villous shortening (panel D) the normal villous epithelium of the jejunums was recorded in pigs inoculated with Aram-P29-CA (panel E), and a mock-inoculated piglet (panel F). no PEDV antigen was detected in the jejunums of all at day 4 post-farrowing, all neonates in groups 1 and 2 were orally exposed to the virulent Aram-P5 virus. nursing piglets in group 3 were mock-inoculated with MEM. clinical signs were recorded daily, and fecal swabs were collected before and after the challenge. the virus titers are the mean virus titers from all pigs. error bars represent the mean standard deviation of the mean. PEDV-associated mortality occurred in > 50% piglets (11 of 20) from unvaccinated sows. all sows developed anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies after the live prime vaccination. thereafter, the neutralizing antibody titers in sera of vaccinated sows gradually increased. all three sows maintained high neutralizing antibody titers for 2 weeks post-farrowing. pre-farrowing and nursing piglets were challenged with virulent G2b PEDV at 4 days of age. the samples were collected at the indicated time points and tested by virus neutralization assay using Aram-P5. p values were calculated by comparing the data from the vaccinated and unvaccinated sow groups. the cells were fixed at 24 hpi and incubated with MAb against the N protein. the cells were then examined under a fluorescence microscope at 200 magnification. the cells were then examined under a fluorescence microscope at 200 magnification. the genome size of the Aram strain was 11-nt shorter than that of most G2b field viruses. this was due to the presence of the unique 9-nt and 2-nt deletions (DELs) at genomic positions 21,051\u201321,059 and 25,207\u201325,208. the former 9-nt DEL resulted in a 3-aa DEL at aa positions 140\u2013142 in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein. phylogenetic analysis based on the complete S protein clearly classified the PEDV strains into two distinct genogroup clusters, G1 and G2, with two subgroups in each genogroup. subsequent whole-genome phylogeny showed the same grouping structure as that of an S gene-based phylogenetic tree. phylogenetic analyses based on the nucleotide sequences of the spike (S) genes (A) and full-length genomes (B) of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains. a region of the S gene and the complete genome sequence of transmissible gastroenteritis virus were included as the outgroups in each tree. by 5 DPI, 100% pigs of group 1, 60% (3/5) pigs of groups 2 and 3 and 20% (1/5) pigs of group 4 died from PED-related clinical signs. all five pigs in groups 5 (inoculated with virus dilution of 106) remained active and clinically unaffected throughout the 5-day experimental period. antisera were collected from the pigs at 0-, 1-, 2-, and 3-week after oral administration of each virus. the serum samples obtained from pigs immunized with the cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA strain had higher neutralizing antibody titers compared with those from other CA virus-inoculated groups. the aram-P29-CA virus showed delayed replication (late CPE onset) at 37\u00b0C as compared to 32\u00b0C, indicating impairment of growth at 37\u00b0C. the mutation occurred during the cold adaptation of PEDV. no additional INDELs were found in the genome after cold adaptation. Fig. 5 represents the organization of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus genome (approximately 28 kb) the lower panels symbolize the genomes of the parental Aram-P5 strain and its cold-adapted derivative. pathogenicity of the cold-adapted Aram-P29-CA virus in neonatal piglets Next, animal inoculation experiments were performed to examine the in vivo phenotypic alterations associated with serial in vitro passage at low temperatures. clinical significance scores and virus shedding were measured in piglets inoculated with PEDV Aram-P5, -P29-CA, or mock. the virus titers (log10 tissue culture infectious dose50/mL) are the mean virus titers from all pigs and error bars represent the mean standard deviation. negative control piglets remained active without the onset of diarrhea and PEDV fecal shedding throughout the experimental period. piglets in the parental Aram-P5-infected group were necropsied upon death at 4 or 5 DPI, while piglets in the remaining groups were euthanized. pigs showed normal intestinal histopathologies (panel E), analogous to those of the negative control group (panel F). small intestines from representative piglets inoculated with PEDV Aram-P5 (A), -P29-CA (B), or mock (C) were examined for gross lesions. no PEDV antigen was detected in the jejunums of all PEDV piglets. three sows in group 1 were orally primed and boosted with live vaccines. at day 4 post-farrowing, all neonates in groups 1 and 2 were orally exposed to the virulent Aram-P5 virus. piglets from unvaccinated sows developed clinical symptoms, including anorexia and diarrhea by 1 DPC (mean CSS of > 2.4) litters from vaccinated sows significantly mitigated diarrhea after the challenge compared to those from unvaccinated sows. 10 of 30 piglets born by vaccinated sows (group 1) died from PEDV exposure. all animals from vaccinated sows (group 1) showed PEDV shedding in feces by 3 DPI with a peak mean titer of 105.47 TCID50/mL. however, amounts of fecal shedding significantly declined thereafter. nursing piglets from each litter in group 1 had anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies. none showed anti-PEDV neutralizing antibodies in serum and colostrum samples. piglets were primed/boosted orally with live Aram-P29-CA vaccine. maternal vaccination is the only crucial and effective tool to confer passive immunity to newborn piglets through lactogenic immunity against PEDV infection. this objective may be accomplished by the selection of an ideal vaccine candidate, which is close to that of an epidemic strain, and virulence is minimal or absent in piglets. gene and phylogenetic analyses showed that the Aram isolates are most closely related to the recent G2b strains prevalent worldwide. but sequence comparisons with other PEDV strains revealed outstanding genomic features in the Aram strain, which naturally included two independent DELs in S and ORF3 respectively. a growing body of evidence suggests that a combination of multiple genetic mutations in S, ORF3 and functional nsps affects PEDV virulence. the accessory ORF3 gene is dispensable for PEDV replication in vitro. conservation of the complete ORF3 in PEDV field isolates still suggests its importance in causing natural infection in the animal host. a total of 12 non-silent mutations arose in ORFs 1 through 5, except for ORF3 without extra INDELs throughout the genome. intriguingly, 7-aa substitutions were accumulated in the S protein, among which 4- and 3-aa substitutions were distributed in the N-terminus of S1 and S2 domains respectively. piglets born to vaccinated and unvaccinated sow groups were inoculated orally with the parental virulent PEDV strain. piglets born to vaccinated and unvaccinated sow groups had mild-to-moderate diarrhea. piglets born to unvaccinated sows presented a much higher mean CSS. piglets from unvaccinated sows discharged high amounts of the virus in feces until death. fecal shedding in animals from vaccinated sows was greatly reduced at 7 DPC. more than 50% of piglets that survived shed no virus in stools. piglet protection by transfer of maternal immunity via mammary secretions from the immunized dams. this is the first report describing the development of a cold-adapted MLV vaccine based on a virulent G2b PEDV strain. this study demonstrated the loss of virulence of a highly pathogenic PEDV strain. vaccination programs could be established based on various herd circumstances. it is noteworthy that maternal vaccination has to be implemented in conjunction with additional intervention strategies for PED prevention and eradication."}
