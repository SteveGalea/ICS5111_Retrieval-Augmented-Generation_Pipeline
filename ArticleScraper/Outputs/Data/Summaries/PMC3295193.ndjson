{"summary": "around 30% of human genes encode proteins that are synthesized on membrane-bound ribosomes of the endoplasmic reticulum. folding of these proteins within the ER is a complex process that is aided by chaperones and enzymes for posttranslational modification (2). ated IRE1 excises 26 nucleotides from the unspliced XBP1 (XBP1u) mRNA. spliced mRNA encodes XBP1u protein (33 kDa) which is rapidly degraded. XBP1 gene transcription is induced by XBP1s itself and activated ATF6 (69) the global inhibition of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of eIF2 (eIF2-P) during the early response (first 3 h) represses translation of most mRNAs (48, 50). however, some mRNAs that encode stress response proteins are translated more efficiently when eIF2 is phosphorylated (51). cytoplasmic splicing required both cytoplasmic splicing of XBP1 mRNA and phosphorylation of eIF2. stability of XBP1s mRNA was dependent on reduced translation of this message during early ER stress. zolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (5 M) and cordycepin (10 g/ml) were obtained from Calbiochem and Sigma. mRNA half-lives were evaluated 48 h after transfection. the specificity of the method for detecting exogenous mRNA was demonstrated by the lack of bands in untransfected cells. XBP1/ MEFs were transfected with the indicated constructs and treated with Tg for 3 h. the former cells were cultured with 1-NM-PP1 overnight before the experiment. cDNAs were inserted into the HindIII and NotI sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+), followed by sequencing to identify XBP1u and XBP1s clones. the amplification added a FLAG epitope to the N terminus of the XBP1 open reading frame. construct 4 encodes a hairpin in the mRNA 5\u2032-UTR. it was created by annealing the 5\u2032-phosphorylated primers 5\u2032-AGCTTCAAGCTTATCGATTTCGAACCCGGGGTAGA. ligation into the HindIII site of construct 3. polyribosome analysis was performed on cell lysates by sucrose gradient sedimentation. mRNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR as described above. mRNAs were reverse transcribed using a primer specific for vector sequences in the 3\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) expression plasmids used to analyze the role of mRNA splicing in the stabilization of XBP1s mRNA during the UPR. XBP1/ cells transfected with indicated plasmids were cultured with Tg for 3 h. XBP1u and total XBP1 mRNAs were amplified by RT-PCR. RT-PCR on RNA from IRE/ and S/S cells amplified the appropriate cDNAs. amplification added a FLAG epitope to the N terminus of the XBP1 open reading frame. cDNAs were inserted into the HindIII and NotI sites of pcDNA3.1/Hygro(+) (Invitrogen) followed by sequencing to identify XBP1u and XBP1s clones. Construct 2, which contains the 5\u2032-UTR of the ATF4 mRNA, was created by annealing the 5\u2032 1.4 g of total RNA was G-I tailed and reverse transcribed using a tail-specific primer. samples were amplified by PCR using an XBP1-specific forward primer and either an XBP1-specific reverse primer or the universal reverse primer provided with the kit. XBP1s protein levels showed a large gradual increase between 3 and 9 h in Tg-treated S/S cells. XBP1s mRNA accumulated to levels 30-fold higher after 3 h of Tg treatment, with an additional 1.5-fold increase between 3 and 9 h. XBP1u and XBP1s mRNAs were assessed by RT-qPCR. the levels of XBP1u and XBP1s mRNAs were assessed by RT-qPCR. XBP1 gene transcription is regulated by XBP1 itself and the transcription factor ATF6 (69) the half-life of XBP1s mRNA in S/S-treated cells increased from 2.8 0.5 to 6.6 1.8 h (means standard errors) after 3 h of Tg treatment. the conversion of XBP1u to XBP1s mRNA does not contribute to the accumulation of XBP1s mRNA during the measurement of the mRNA half-life. the effect of eIF2-P on XBP1s mRNA stability could be the result of signaling pathways that are triggered by eIF2-P. we favor the latter possibility, because XBP1s mRNA stability increased in S/S cells after 30 min of Tg treatment. if the inhibition of protein synthesis increased the half-life of XBP1s mRNA in Tg-treated A/A cells increased from 1.2 0.1 to 9 2 h in the XBP1s protein was quantified by Western blotting. incubation of A/A cells with Hip and Tg gave greater mRNA levels than Tg alone, even though Hip had no effect by itself. in addition, the XBP1s mRNA level fell when Hip was removed. toplasmic splicing of XBP1u is required for increased XBP1s mRNA stability during the UPR. expression vectors for XBP1u and XBP1s cDNAs were transfected into MEFs deficient in XBP1 (XBP1/) the expressed mRNAs were analyzed for their turnover during the UPR. we hypothesized that IRE1/ MEFs transfected with IRE1 I642G should splice the endogenous XBP1u mRNA to XBP1s without increasing its stability. the half-life of XBP1s mRNA in IRE1-1642G-expressing cells treated with 1-NM-PP1 was 1.2 h, which increased to 1.8 h when Tg was added. poly(A) tail length (PAT) assay in S/S and A/A cells. isolated mRNAs were tailed and reverse transcribed. they were then analyzed using two sets of primers. the length of the poly(A) tail was estimated from the size differences. length of poly(A) tails on XBP1 mRNA in S/S cells transiently increased during the UPR. poly(A) tails were longer after 3 h of stress, and this increase was no longer evident at 7 h. accumulation of XBP1s mRNA with longer poly(A) tails correlate with increased mRNA stability during the early UPR. the half-life of the XBP1s mRNA after 7 h of Tg treatment in S/S cells was shorter than in untreated cells. translational recovery following Hip treatment of A/A cells caused destabilization of the XBP1s mRNA. XBP1s mRNA stabilization during the early UPR requires inhibition of protein synthesis or specific inhibition of XBP1s mRNA translation. mRNAs are found in heavier polyribosomes when they are efficiently translated and in lighter polyribosomes. decreased translational efficiency is required for stabilization of XBP1s mRNA during ER stress. S/S cells were transfected with the indicated constructs from Fig. 3A. expression of Flag-XBP1s was detected by Western blotting. transgenic XBP1s mRNA levels were then reverse transcribed using qPCR. the encoded XBP1 protein contained a FLAG epitope. both constructs encode XBP1u; construct 2 also contains the 5\u2032-UTR. translational efficiency of XBP1s mRNA increased after 3 h of Tg treatment. the half-life of mRNA expressed as XBP1s from construct 3 had similar half-lives with and without Tg treatment. this was confirmed by low expression of FLAG-XBP1s protein (Fig. 6C) decreased translation efficiency by itself does not impart increased stability to the XBP1s mRNA from construct 4 that has not been subjected to cytoplasmic splicing. our combined data support the conclusion that the UPR increases the stability of XBP1s mRNA via a mechanism that requires cytoplasmic splicing and inhibition of its own translation. regulation of XBP1s mRNA stability requires \u201cmarks\u201d left on the mRNA by splicing is reminiscent of the non-sense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) pathway (7, 10). this process involves marks left on mRNAs at the exon junctions which target these mRNAs for degradation if they are upstream of PTCs. previous studies have shown that cellular stress stabilizes NMD-targeted mRNAs (10) XBP1s mRNA splicing marks the mRNA in a way that enables its stabilization. we measured the half-life of the XBP1s mRNA in late stress (8 h of Tg treatment) in the presence and absence of Hip. a genome-wide screen by the Gorospe group did not identify XBP1 as an mRNA with regulated turnover. XBP1s protein levels showed a large gradual increase between 3 and 9 h in Tg-treated S/S cells. XBP1s mRNA is expressed in control cells, even though the UPR is not induced. XBP1 gene transcription is regulated by XBP1 itself and the transcription factor ATF6 (69) which is activated during the UPR. the half-life of XBP1s mRNA in S/S and A/A cells increased from 2.8 0.5 to 6.6 1.8 h after 3 h of Tg treatment. the conversion of XBP1u to XBP1u mRNA does not contribute to the accumulation of XBP1s mRNA during the measurement of the mRNA half-life. similar data were obtained when the UPR was induced with tunicamycin. inhibition of translation initiation during ER stress stabilizes the XBP1s mRNA. the effect of eIF2-P on XBP1s mRNA stability could be the result of signaling pathways that are triggered by eIF2-P. h followed by 4 h of incubation in Tg and ActD. inhibition of protein synthesis in A/A cells stabilizes XBP1s mRNA. s levels in A/A cells were demonstrated by examining target gene ERDJ4 (25) inhibition of protein synthesis during the UPR plays a central role in the increased XBP1s mRNA stability during the UPR. the XBP1u mRNA was efficiently spliced in XBP1/ cells treated with Tg. the IRE1 protein initiates XBP1u mRNA splicing by cleavage of the mRNA. it is activated by the UPR-induced stimulation of the IRE1 protein kinase and autophosphorylation (28). the IRE1 protein initiates XBP1u mRNA splicing. poly(A) tail length does not affect the stabilization of XBP1s mRNA during the UPR. mRNA poly(A) tail length does not affect the stabilization of XBP1s mRNA during the UPR. XBP1 mRNA splicing was assessed by RT-PCR. XBP1s mRNA half-life was measured as described for panel A. cells treated with cordycepin and Tg are similar to the value seen with Tg alone (7.0 0.9 h) translational recovery during the UPR leads to decreased stability of XBP1s mRNA. the very long half-life of XBP1s mRNA in GADD34/ MEFs can be explained by the severe inhibition of protein synthesis that results in the absence of XBP1s protein in these cells. our combined data suggest that during the UPR, translational repression stabilizes the XBP1s mRNA. XBP1s mRNA was translated in control cells, with 67% of the mRNA present on polyribosomes. Tg treatment caused a shift of the XBP1s mRNA species out of polyribosomes, with 24% remaining at 1 h. translational recovery during late stress was evident. construct 2 was significantly different from control cells with construct 1 (P 0.05) constructs encode XBP1s mRNAs with 5\u2032-UTRs that affect the translational efficiency. to determine if the stabilization of XBP1s mRNA during the UPR requires the specific inhibition of this mRNA's translation, we compared the half-lives of XBP1s mRNA from construct 1 and 2. polyribosome analysis showed that mRNA from construct 1 was translated in control cells and poorly translated after 3 h of Tg treatment. it is noteworthy that the stability of the mRNA from construct 2 decreased during the UPR when its translational efficiency increased. despite the absence of a change in half-life, the translational efficiency of this mRNA was reduced by Tg treatment. construct 4 contains a hairpin in the 5\u2032-UTR, which should inhibit translation initiation (9) this was confirmed by low expression of FLAG-XBP1s protein (Fig. 6C) and low association with polyribosomes. the half-lives of the FLAG-XBP1s mRNAs from construct 4 were similar in unstressed cells. molecular memory of the XBP1s mRNA regulates turnover independently of the NMD pathway. this process involves marks left on mRNAs at the exon junctions which target these mRNAs for degradation if they are upstream of PTCs. previous studies have shown that cellular stress (nutrient deprivation and hypoxia) stabilizes NMD-targeted mRNAs. depletion of XBP1 mRNA did not affect half-life of XBP1s mRNA in control or Tg-treated A/A cells. DNAJB2 mRNA, a target of the NMD pathway (10), was stabilized in UPF1-depleted A/A cells. these data suggest that the XBP1s mRNA is not targeted by the NMD pathway. splicing occurs very early in the stress response (by 30 min, 60% of the XBP1 mRNA is spliced) the accumulated XBP1s mRNA becomes available for translation during late stress, when eIF2 is dephosphorylated. the requirement for splicing is established by the fact that exogenously expressed XBP1u mRNA produced an XBP1s mRNA that was stabilized during the early UPR. the importance of translational inhibition of the XBP1s mRNA was shown using construct 2, which contains the 5\u2032-UTR of the ATF4 mRNA. XBP1s protein is synthesized from the accumulated mRNA. loss of translational inhibition leads to rapid turnover of the mRNA. cytoplasmic splicing of the mRNA leads to its stabilization. mark placed by splicing can cause mRNA stabilization by recurrence of translational repression. this is in contrast to mRNAs that are stabilized during ER stress. this is in contrast to mRNAs that are stabilized during ER stress in a manner independent of their own translational efficiency. exogenously expressed XBP1u mRNA, which contained the 3\u2032-UTR, was not stabilized during the early UPR. if the 3\u2032-UTR is involved, it must interact with other factors, including the \u201cmark\u201d that is added to the mRNA during cytoplasmic splicing. inhibition of stress granule formation by preventing expression of the key TIAR protein had no effect on regulation of XBP1s mRNA stability during the UPR. the regulation of XBP1s mRNA stability is part of a positive feedback loop that regulates XBP1s protein accumulation during the UPR. our findings further highlight the importance of translational control during the UPR in cell fate decisions. XBP1 levels are important in innate immunity as they regulate inflammatory gene expression (36), in hepatic lipogenesis via induction of lipogenic genes (26), and in glucose homeostasis via its actions independent of transcription (71)"}
