{"summary": "specialized sensors detect pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are \u201cnon-self\u201d to the cell. recognition of viral PAMPs by PRRs activates downstream signaling pathways and the production of effector proteins to combat viral infection. the production and secretion of IFN-/ play a key role in the implementation of an antiviral state that restricts virus replication in infected cells. cells react to several types of stress by phosphorylating eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2 (eIF2) at serine 51, thereby rendering eIF2 inactive and halting cap-dependent translation (11) Vaccinia virus, orthoreovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, murine cytomegalovirus, and reovirus all activate a cellular stress response via PKR. coronaviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus, Epstein-Barr virus, and human cytomegalovirus activate PERK (9, 10). SG induction is associated with increased virus replication. the viral genome has a single open reading frame that codes for a large polyprotein, which is processed by viral proteases into the structural and nonstructural proteins. members of the genera Enterovirus circumvent this induction of IFN-/ by degrading MDA5 via the proteasome degradation pathway. poliovirus actively reverses the formation of SG by cleaving the essential component G3BP (27). a mutant mengovirus with a compromised L, but not wild-type (wt) virus induces SG formation in a PKR-dependent manner. the importance of MDA5 localization to these SG for induction of IFN-/ is investigated in detail.

TMEV L represses SG formation in picornavirus-infected cells. mutant mengovirus in which the Zn-finger domain of L is disrupted (mengo-Zn) (28) induced clear cytoplasmic aggregates of G3BP, a hallmark of SG. cells were fixed 6 h.p.i. and stained using an antibody against TIA1. TIA1 and G3BP form cytoplasmic aggregates upon mengo-Zn infection, while Sam68 maintains its nuclear localization. mengovirus-induced SG formation is PKR dependent and represses viral RNA replication. the identity of the kinase that is activated by mengo-Zn, or any other picornavirus, is as yet unknown. mengo-Zn induces SG in a PKR-dependent manner. PERKKO cells failed to form SG upon thapsigargin treatment. nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33258. cells containing SG were stained with Hoechst-33258. cells were fixed at 6 h.p.i. and stained for eIF3. mengo-Zn replicated to higher yields (2-to-3-fold increase in intracellular viral RNA level) than their litter controls. mengo-Zn replicated to 2-fold-higher levels in both cells treated with a PKR inhibitor (PKRi) that reduced SG formation. we investigated whether virus-induced activation of the stress pathway influenced activation of the apoptosis or autophagy pathway in virus-infected HeLa cells. inhibition of the stress pathway had no effect on PARP cleavage (a hallmark of apoptosis) or LC3 lipidation (a hallmark of autophagy) in either wt- or mengo-Zn-infected cells. the distribution of MDA5 upon picornavirus infection is largely unknown. however, the distribution of MDA5 upon virus infection is largely unknown. we investigated the localization of MDA5 in picornavirus-infected cells using immunofluorescence microscopy. single-cell magnified images clearly showed that dsRNA does not colocalize with the MDA5 granules. cells were fixed at 6 h.p.i. and stained for G3BP (red) and MDA5 (green) cells were stained with Hoechst-33258. cells were treated with recombinant human IFN-2 and mouse IFN-. neither of the cell types showed formation of SG upon IFN treatment. nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33258. to test this possibility, we overexpressed the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RIG-I or its downstream interacting partner MAVS. this triggers phosphorylation of IRF3 and transcription of IFN- mRNA upon ectopic expression. pppRNA and poly(IC) ligand activates MDA5 (49). PKR-deficient cells failed to show SG formation upon RNA ligand transfection. but a small reduction in IFN- mRNA induction was observed. RT-qPCR analysis of IFN- mRNA levels from mengo-Zn-infected HeLa and MEF cells is presented. data are presented as the means SD of the results of triplicate experiments analyzed using an unpaired t test (ns, no significant difference; *, significant difference at P 0.05). puromycin is a known inhibitor of protein translation that causes disassembly of the ribosome complex. emetine and cycloheximide are compounds that fix complete ribosomes on mRNA transcripts. however, transfection of pppRNA and poly(IC) into cells treated with puromycin resulted in SG formation. a mutant mengovirus in which the Zn-finger domain of L is disrupted (mengo-wt) (28) induced clear cytoplasmic aggregates of G3BP, a hallmark of SG. this was not due to differences in replication kinetics. nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33258. TIA1 and G3BP form cytoplasmic aggregates upon mengo-Zn infection, while Sam68 maintains its nuclear localization. mengovirus-induced SG formation is PKR dependent and represses viral RNA replication. the identity of the kinase that is activated by mengo-Zn is as yet unknown. PKR KO cells failed to form SG upon mengo-Zn infection. mengo-Zn induces SG in a PKR-dependent manner. these data strongly suggest that mengo-Zn induces SG in a PKR-dependent manner. cells containing SG were counted, and the results are shown in the graphs. cells containing SG were deficient in PKR expression. mengo-Zn replicated to higher yields (2-to-3-fold increase in intracellular viral RNA level) than litter controls. mengovirus infection induces autophagy and apoptosis pathways. apoptosis or autophagy pathway in virus-infected cells in which PKR was depleted by siRNAs. inhibition of the stress pathway had no effect on apoptosis or autophagy pathways. PKR knockdown, which prevents SG formation, had no effect on the induction of apoptosis as detected by the degradation of full-length (FL) PARP into the smaller cleavage product. infection with mengo-wt-infected cells resulted in granular localization of MDA5. the granules were distinct from the smaller dsRNA-containing puncta that most likely represent the replication complexes. however, we considered that MDA5 might localize to SG. immunofluorescence images of mock-treated and mengo-Zn-infected HeLa and MEF cells showed that dsRNA does not colocalize with the MDA5 granules. cells were fixed at 6 h.p.i. and stained for G3BP (red) and MDA5 (green) the transcription of interferon-stimulated genes (MDA5 and PKR) was induced. neither cell types showed formation of SG upon IFN treatment. nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33258. to test this possibility, we overexpressed the caspase recruitment domain (CARD) of RIG-I or its downstream interacting partner MAVS. both have been reported to trigger phosphorylation of IRF3 and transcription of IFN- mRNA upon ectopic expression. PKR-deficient cells failed to show SG formation upon RNA ligand transfection. but transcription of IFN- mRNA was efficiently induced by RNA ligand transfection. SG formation is not required for ligand recognition and IFN-\u00df mRNA induction. cells were fixed at 6 h postinfection or -transfection and stained for eIF3. nuclei were stained with Hoechst-33258. RNA from pppRNA (top)- and poly(IC)-transfected HeLa cells was isolated. puromycin is a known inhibitor of protein translation that causes disassembly of the ribosome complex. emetine and cycloheximide are compounds that fix complete ribosomes on mRNA transcripts. emetine and cycloheximide are compounds that fix complete ribosomes on mRNA transcripts, which results also in a halt in protein translation but prevents the formation of SG (52). the same mutant mengovirus activates the stress response pathway via PKR, resulting in SG formation. a single viral protein, L, antagonizes the induction of the IFN-/ pathway as well as the antiviral stress pathway. this suggests a possible link between these two antiviral systems. granules colocalized with G3BP and TIA-1 suggesting that MDA5 localizes to SG in mengo-Zn-infected cells. these RNA-rich granules also serve as a ligand recognition platform for MDA5. this suggests that the dsRNA ligand could be trapped in SG. eIF2a S51A mutation showed levels of induction of the IFN-/ pathway on mengo-Zn infection and transfection of pppRNA and poly(IC) similar to those seen with wild-type MEFs. these data strongly suggest that SG formation is dispensable for the induction of the IFN-/ pathway via RLR activation. NS1-induced SG by 3-fold and reported a 5-fold reduction in IFN- mRNA transcription in PKR KO MEFs compared to control cells. a complete lack of IFN-/ pathway activation was observed in PKR KO MEFs upon transfection of IAV ssRNA. a reduction in IFN-/ mRNA transcription was observed in MEFs expressing N-terminally truncated PKR but not in MEFs expressing PKR lacking kinase activity due to disruption of the kinase domain (66). the issue remains why MDA5 localizes to SG upon mengo-Zn infection."}
