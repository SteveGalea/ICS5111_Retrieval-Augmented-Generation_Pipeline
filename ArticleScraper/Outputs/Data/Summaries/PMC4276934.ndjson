{"summary": "bats belong to Chiroptera, the second-most species-rich order of mammals with more than 1100 species. they have other anatomic and behavioral features that appear to be unique. a balance of host response and virus replication is essential for establishment of a reservoir host/virus relationship. experimental infection of A. literatus with H. capsulatum resulted in fatal histoplasmosis in some bats but chronic systemic infection in others. powered flight allows large home ranges, including over large bodies of water that can be transited in relatively short amounts of time. these features present difficulties for studying bats and their infectious agents under field conditions. microbial agents have evolved immune-evasion strategies that manipulate the host response in a manner favorable to the virus. many microbial agents, particularly viruses, have evolved immune-evasion strategies that manipulate the host response in a manner favorable to the virus. zoonotic viruses are, by definition, pathogenic to humans. but they are usually non- or minimally-pathogenic in the reservoir hosts. zoonotic viruses do not cause clinical disease in flying foxes. several recent publications have suggested that bats are reservoir hosts of zoonotic viruses because they are somehow special relative to other mammalian species. a role for regulatory T cells may contribute to persistent infection without disease to these otherwise innocuous viruses. rabies is beyond the scope of this work to adequately discuss rabies virus infections of bats. artibeus bats developed rabies after subcutaneous infection. intramuscular infection led to rapid clinical progression of rabies. subcutaneous infection led to delayed clinical progression of rabies. a large number of Schreiber\u2019s bent-winged bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) were found dead in caves in the Iberian Peninsula, the border region of Spain, Portugal and France. none of the 9 dead Myotis myotis bats collected at the site had a colony of Schreiber\u2019s bats. studies have thoroughly examined the host response of bats infected rabies virus. Turmelle et al. [62] experimentally infected big brown bats (Eptesicus fuscus) with rabies virus and found that most survived for the several months of the study. 19 isolates of TCRV were made from 6 A. literatus and 5 A. jamaicensis diseased bats collected on the island of Trinidad. only one strain, the original TRVL-11573, remains. authors speculated the die-off was a result of Lloviu virus infection. without a colony of Schreiber\u2019s bats it has not been possible to fulfill Koch\u2019s postulates. most notable examples of human pathogenic viruses hosted by bat reservoirs are rabies virus and other lyssaviruses. inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, stimulate the production of prostaglandins that act upon the hypothalamus to increase body temperature. inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, stimulate the production of prostaglandins that act upon the hypothalamus. four broad groups of PRRs have been identified in mammals. toll-like receptors (TLRs), retinoic acid inducible gene-I-like receptors (RLHs), nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-like receptors (NLRs) and interferon-inducible absent in melanoma 2 (Aim2). the PHYIN locus contains the Aim2 and Ifit16 genes in other mammals. orthologous Aim2 sequences are not found in a transcriptome of A. jamaicensis. Ifngr1 and Ifngr2 are found in A. jamaicensis suggesting they possess an Ifng gene. IFN from P. alecto impairs viral replication in bat cells, reducing Hendra virus replication in P. alecto cells. responses of innate immunocells and lymphocytes play essential roles in the host response to infection. a significant limitation of conducting research into bat lymphocyte responses to viruses is the lack of closed colonies for experimental infection work. the presence of viral PAMPs in cells and tissues is an innate cue. the presence of viral PAMPs is an innate cue that triggers cellular defense mechanisms. many PRRs have been identified, most through scans of genome or transcriptome data. three RLH genes, Ddx58 (RIG-I), Ifih1 (MDA5), Dhx58 (LGP2), have also been cloned from the black flying fox. no functional studies have been performed with virally-infected bat cells. cells were infected with Rift Valley fever virus strain 13, which is defective in its type I IFN repression. supernatants from these cells showed antiviral activities in a VSV reporter system. ifnw loci are also present in bat genomes and appear to have many tandem copies. IFN and IFN induced expression of P. alecto Mx1, a GTPase that may target viral nucleoproteins, and Oas1, which activates RNaseL and degradation of viral RNA. it is likely that bat type I and type III IFNs induce expression of many other antiviral genes. supernatants from these cells showed antiviral activities in a VSV reporter system. ifnw loci are also present in bat genomes and appear to have many tandem copies in species examined. IFN and IFN induced expression of P. alecto Mx1, a GTPase that may target viral nucleoproteins, and Oas1, which activates RNaseL and degradation of viral RNA. it is likely that bat type I and type III IFNs induce expression of many other antiviral genes. only a single IgG isotype has been detected in Carollia perspicillata. Eptesicus fuscus appears to have two IgG isotypes. Myotis lucifugus has five IgG isotypes. most zoos and zoological organizations are unwilling to provide bats for biomedical research purposes. establishment of closed breeding colonies for research requires enrichment for successful maintenance and reproduction. the ability to fly in an enclosure is probably necessary for the social health of the bats. RNA-Seq deep sequencing approaches can shed light on biochemical pathways that are activated or repressed. cost of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has increased depth of coverage, making the price per gigabase even less expensive. RNA-Seq offers investigators a powerful tool to generate large amounts of data. several RNA-Seq assembly programs are available in the public domain, including Trinity [112] and Oases [113] each program has advantages and disadvantages, so it is essential to carefully examine packages to determine which is most suited for a given dataset. most transcripts will be identified by BLAST, including some noncoding RNAs. but many others will have no hits in the databases. determining the roles of differentially-expressed genes can be readily identified using DAVID [118] and Reactome [119]. sequencing of genomes is one approach to mitigating this problem. the principal advantage of genome sequencing is that all genetic information is present in datasets. new tools are now available that can rapidly mine unannotated genome (and transcriptome) data. commercially-available reagents may be used for long-term antigen-specific cultures of bat T and B cells. without inbred bats, it is difficult to conduct such work. one solution to this problem may be the use of autologous APC. bone marrow is a rich source of progenitor cells for their generation. many bat species of interest for zoonotic diseases weigh more than a hundred grams. it should be possible to obtain large numbers of bone marrow cells that can be aliquoted and stored frozen for long-term use for T cell antigen recall experiments. the establishment of closed breeding colonies for research purposes is an essential component for developing controlled, hypothesis-driven research. the decision of which bat species to use is driven by the virus-of-interest. fruit bats are easier to colonize than insectivorous bats, which must learn to eat non-flying insects. many of the viruses of interest hosted by bats require BSL-3 or BSL-4 containment. RNA-Seq offers investigators a powerful tool to generate large amounts of data, regardless of the bat species of interest. assembly of reads from vertebrate RNA-Seq data requires multiprocessor/multicore computers, hundreds of gigabytes of RAM, terabytes of hard drive capacity and familiarity with Linux operating systems. however, many institutions have such computational resources, others do not. BLAST is used to identify transcripts using the RefSeq_RNA, mir-Base and IgProt databases. most transcripts will be identified by BLAST, including some noncoding RNAs. many others will have no hits in the databases and these transcripts can be difficult to interpret. some immune genes are highly conserved (e.g., Tnf) whereas others are less so (e.g., Ifng). sequencing of genomes is one approach to mitigating this problem and its cost has decreased substantially. elin abundance leads to elevated ceramides, which are toxic to hepatocytes. obstacles impede such research, including lack of recombinant bat cytokines. commercially-available reagents for species that are phylogenetically closer to bats may be used for long-term antigen-specific cultures. humerus and radius bones of bats are rich sources of bone marrow. they are easily prepared for bone marrow retrieval. many bat species of interest for zoonotic diseases weigh more than a hundred grams."}
