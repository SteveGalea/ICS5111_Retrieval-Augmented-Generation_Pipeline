{"summary": "multidrug-resistant A. baumannii (MDR-AB) isolates have been increasingly reported worldwide. incidence of carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii is growing steadily in china and many other countries. otypic methods (e.g., the VITEK 2 system and the API 20 NE system) or DNA-based testing such as PCR (e.g., 16S rRNA gene amplification) have been used to successfully identify most Acinetobacter species. however, there are some limitations in these methods. we describe a LAMP method for the rapid detection of A. baumannii in clinical samples targeting the blaOXA-51 gene. we also investigated molecular-epidemiology and antibiotic-resistance profiles, and detected several common oxacillinase genes from A. baumannii isolates. non-Acinetobacter species were cultured at 37\u00b0C in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth overnight.

(1995) primers were used for specific amplification of blaOXA-51-like and the OXA carbapenemases PCR detection. the primer mixture contained 12.5 l reaction mixtures. IP, 20 pmol for LF and LB, 5 pmol for F3 and B3), and 1 l of Bst polymerase (eight units, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) was added to each 25 l LAMP-reaction mixture. a visual color-change detection method was employed to compare sensitivity and specificity of LAMP with PCR. es of Acinetobacter sp. are represented by 4 main phylogenetic subgroups: OXA-23-like, OXA-24-like, OXA-51-like, and OXA-58. PCR was performed in a 25-l reaction mixtures containing 12.5 l PCR Master Mix Reagent (Tiangen Biotech Co., Ltd., Beijing, China) A. baumannii bacteria were grown overnight at 37\u00b0C in Luria-Bertani (LB) broth. non-Acinetobacter species were cultured at 37\u00b0C in brain heart infusion (BHI) broth overnight. seudomonas aeruginosa ATCC27853 The Microorganism Center Reference strain Salmonella aberdeen 9264 The Microorganism Center Reference strain Salmonella enteritidis 50326-1 The Microorganism Center Reference strain Shigella flexneri 4536 The Microorganism Center Reference strain Shigella sonnei 2531 The Microorganism Center Reference strain Vibrio carchariae 2732 The Microorganism Center Reference strain Vibrio mic DNA was prepared in agarose plugs and digested with the restriction enzyme ApaI. gel images were analyzed using a CHEF-DRIII apparatus. the interpretation of gels was performed by visual inspection using the criteria of Tenover et al. (1995) sets of primers were designed, including the outer forward primer (F3), the outer backward primer (B3), the forward inner primer (FIP), the backward inner primer (BIP) and additional loop primers (loops F and B), as shown in Table 2. Sequence of primers used for specific amplification of blaOXA-51-like. l reaction mixtures (DNA Amplification Kit; Eiken Chemical Co., Ltd., Tochigi, Japan), 2.6 l primer mixture (40 pmol for FIP and BIP, 20 pmol for LF and LB, and 5 pmol for F3 and B3), and 1 l of Bst polymerase (eight units, New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) were added to each 25 l LAMP-reaction mixture PCR was performed in 25-l reaction mixtures containing 12.5 l PCR Master Mix Reagent. PCR was performed in a 25-l reaction mixture containing 12.5 l of forward primer (10 pmol), 1 l of reverse primer (10 pmol), and 1 l of DNA template. Turbidity was monitored using a Loopamp real-time turbidimeter by measuring the absorbance at 650 nm every 6 s. the OXA-4 primer set was chosen as the most appropriate primers for the rapid detection of A. baumannii. amplification efficiency was highest at 65\u00b0C and was used in subsequent experiments. 10-fold serial dilutions were tested using genomic DNA extracted from A. baumannii ATCC 22933. the detection limits of real-time turbidity and visual detection were both 50 pg/l, which was 10-fold more sensitive than traditional PCR assay. ten pairs of sputum samples and nasopharyngeal swabs from healthy people were collected as controls. all clinical samples were simultaneously analyzed by LAMP and PCR. a total of 33 PFGE-banding types were identified. clone C was the dominant clone with 24 isolates. all of these isolates harbored the naturally occurring blaOXA-51-like gene. five sets of different primers were initially tested for detection of the blaOXA-51-like gene. the primers for pgaD gene of A. baumannii were added as a control. the OXA-4 primer set amplified the target sequence within the shortest time. as shown in Figure 3, both methods of analysis positively identified the A. baumannii isolates. all other strains (as well as the blank control) tested negatively, indicating that the LAMP assay was specific for A. baumannii. turbidity was monitored using a loopamp real-time turbidimeter. one microliter of fluorescent detection reagent was added to 25 l of LAMP reaction mixture. PCR products were separated by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis and stained with ethidium bromide. 145 isolates resistant to both IPM and MPM harbored the blaOXA-51-like gene. 92.3% (134 strains) co-occurred with the blaOXA-23 gene. no isolate carried the blaOXA-24 gene. 10 isolates were negative for the tested plasmid-mediated OXA-carbapenemase genes. type 18 (PF-18) represented the dominant epidemic strain in the ICU during the testing period. the dendrogram was generated via the unweighted pair-group method. the dendrogram was generated via the unweighted pair-group method. PFGE analysis showed 33 PFGE-banding patterns were identified and classified into 8 distinct clones, based on Tenover\u2019s criteria (Tenover et al., 1995). Clone C was the dominant clone, making it possibly responsible for the A. baumannii epidemic in the ICUs of the two comprehensive hospitals from which we obtained the isolates. blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24, blaOXA-51-like, and blaOXA-58 genes encoded by the blaOXA-23, blaOXA-24 and blaOXA-58 genes. the chromosome-mediated blaOXA-58 gene has been reported in A. baumannii isolates worldwide and is mediated both by chromosomes or plasmids. the co-occurrence of blaOXA-51-like gene and blaOXA-23 gene could be detected in 134 isolates (92.3%) this result indicated that the plasmid-mediated transfer of blaOXA-23 gene might be the most common mechanism by which A. baumannii becomes carbapenem resistance in these two comprehensive military hospitals in Beijing. LAMP primers are designed to match four or six of the six or eight independent target-sequence regions, so the specificity and sensitivity are enhanced greatly. the detection limit of the LAMP assay was 50 pg/l, about 10-fold greater than that of PCR. the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii has led to an inadequacy of therapeutic choices in treating MDR-AB infections among patients in china. authors say the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest."}
