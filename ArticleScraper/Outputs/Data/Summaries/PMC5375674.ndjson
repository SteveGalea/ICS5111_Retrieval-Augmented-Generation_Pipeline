{"summary": "pathogenic effects of filovirus infections in primates are multiple and complex. infection results in high levels of uncontrolled virus replication, excessive cytokine production, and release of mediators. pathology is exacerbated by the ability of filoviruses to antagonize the innate immune response. the EBOV VP35 IID antagonizes type I interferon signaling by blocking tyrosine-phosphorylated STAT1 (PY-STAT1) transport into the nucleus. a K142A mutation in the VP24 IID decreases its affinity for KPN5. MARV VP40 protein inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation events that are essential for IFN signaling in cells, presumably by blocking Jak1 kinase function (22). henipaviruses, lyssaviruses, and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses have also been increasingly implicated as reservoir hosts of filoviruses. rousette and human cell lines are equally susceptible to EBOV and MARV. the filoviral VP35 IID plays a major role in antagonism of the IFN response in bat cells. important differences were identified in the innate immune responses of bat cells compared to human cells. phylogeny of mitochondrial import receptor subunit TOMM70A showed high sequence identity values across different groups of mammals. the analysis tree did not place bat TOMM70A into a monophyletic cluster. the relatively low sequence identity values between rousette innate immune genes and those from nonchiropteran mammals was the likely explanation for the lack of antigenic cross-reactivity of bat proteins with the available antibodies to human proteins. innate immune genes of Egyptian rousette bats demonstrate only a limited sequence identity to human counterparts. a phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree of IFN- mRNA is present at the nodes. rousette cell lines transfected with IFN- showed increased expression of ISG54 (2.8- to 36.8-fold; P 0.05) and ISG56 (6.4- to 64.8-fold; P 0.01) compared to cells transfected with the empty bat type I IFNs induce innate immune responses in both bat and human cells. bat type II IFN induces responses only in bat cells. uninfected cells were transfected with plasmids expressing IFNs. transfection of human cells with human IFN- resulted in a very limited induction of innate immune genes (0- to 2.6-fold) for comparative purposes we transfected human cells with human IFNs, which resulted in a stronger response than was detected for bat IFNs. rousette cells showed a moderate susceptibility, with 10% eGFP+ cells. eGFP signal was observed in only a small proportion of infected cells. analysis of viral genomic RNA in the infected cells by qRT-PCR and virus titration. a 1-h-long adsorption at 37\u00b0C, cells were washed 3 times with PBS. images were taken 24 h postinfection using a fluorescence microscope with a 20 objective. the experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. despite resistance of rousette bats to EBOV, their cells support replication of this virus at levels similar to those of MARV. both filoviruses replicate in bat and human cells at comparable levels. susceptibility of bat cells to EBOV does not predict host specificity at the organism level. expression of IFN-, ISG54, and ISG56 increased between 6- and 14-fold in infected cells. both rousette cell lines infected with either EBOV or MARV showed 3.5- to 24.6-fold increases of IFN- expression (P 0.05) in rousette and human cells. no significant changes in the expression of ISG54, ISG56, and IFN- were observed in these human cells infected with the wild-type viruses at either time point. we infected the same rousette cell lines and human cell lines HepG2 and 769p with biological isolates of EBOV, strain Kikwit (EBOV-Kik), and Makona (EBOV-Mak) at an MOI of 2 PFU/cell. infection with MARV-Uga(b) resulted in strong upregulation of ISG56 in both rousette cell lines and in human 769p cells as early as 24 h postinfection. in contrast, MARV-Ang caused ISG56 expression patterns similar to those observed for infection with EBOV. 1,488 and 11,523 unique genes were identified in R06EJ and RoNi/7 cells. those included 642 genes annotated as being involved in the innate immune response in humans. but only 6.8% of such genes expressed in R06EJ and 13.3% of those expressed in RoNi/7 cells demonstrated up- or downregulation in response to filovirus infection compared to uninfected cells. expression increased 10.9-fold in R06EJ cells and up to 20.8-fold in RoNi/7 cells infected with MARV-Uga(h) expression of IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- was minimal and showed no significant changes. the detected upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes implies that IFNs are induced at earlier time points not covered by our sampling. b *, IFNGR type not specified; **, other cell lines tested did not express detectable amounts of IFN- mRNA. c ND, not determined; NA, not applicable. no increase in IFN- and IFN- expression was detected at either time point. the difference between cells infected with the mutants versus wt EBOV was increased. the other human cell line tested, 293T, showed a lower induction of the innate immune response to the EBOV mutants compared to wt EBOV. additional data on unblocking the innate immune response in rousette cells was obtained via transcriptome analysis of RoNi/7 cells infected with the EBOV mutants. eGFP+ RoNi/7 cells infected with EBOV/VP35m and EBOV/VP35m/VP24m did not show a significant effect on replication of the virus. in human cells, the disabling of either IID failed to result in any consistent reduction of virus replication. the levels of expression of the innate immune genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR at 24 and 48 h. the expression patterns were similar to those in uninfected cells. the reduction of viral titers ranged from 25.2- to 616.8-fold. viral titers in culture medium collected 48 h postinfection decreased by only 2.1- 0.6-fold and 2.4- 1.1-fold respectively. transfection of both human cell lines with human type I IFNs decreased virus replication significantly. for IFN- it ranged from 6- to 15-fold (95% CI, 10.2 3.2; P 0.05), and for IFN- it ranged from 4- to 25-fold (95% CI, 13.6 6.6; P 0.05) human type I but not type II IFNs suppress filovirus infection in human cells. monolayers in six-well plates were transfected with human IFNs or with the empty plasmid vector (mock) and 24 h later they were infected with the indicated viruses at an MOI of 2 PFU/cell. the genes of two pteropodid bats, Pteropus alecto and P. vampirus, clustered with genes of insectivorous bats (Eptesicus fuscus, Myotis species, Rhinolophus species) in most of the phylogenetic reconstructions, the bat cluster was well separated from the clusters formed by genes of other mammals. the analysis tree did not place bat TOMM70A into a monophyle innate immune genes of Egyptian rousette bats demonstrate only a limited sequence identity to human counterparts. a phylogenetic neighbor-joining tree of IFN- mRNA is present at the nodes. rousette cell lines transfected with IFN-, IFN-, or IFN-. we frequently observed negative effects of overexpression of one IFN on the expression of other endogenous IFNs. for example, cells transfected with IFN- decreased the expression of IFN-, whereas cells transfected with IFN- decreased the expression of IFN- and IFN-. this phenomenon of interference between different IFNs was previously described. transfection of human cells with human IFN- resulted in a very limited induction of innate immune genes. for comparative purposes we transfected human cells with human IFNs, which resulted in a very limited response. rousette cells demonstrated virus replication, as evidenced by eGFP+ cells at 24 h postinfection. rousette cells demonstrated a moderate susceptibility, with 10% eGFP+ cells. eGFP signal observed in only a small proportion of infected cells. cell monolayers in six-well plates were transfected with either empty vector (mock) or plasmids expressing IFN-, IFN-, or IFN- of Egyptian rousette bats. after a 1-h-long adsorption at 37\u00b0C, cells were washed 3 times with PBS. images were taken 24 h postinfection using a fluorescence microscope with a 20 objective. cells with several additional strains of EBOV and MARV are equally susceptible to EBOV and MARV. the experiments were performed as described in the legend to Fig. 3. despite the resistance of Egyptian rousette bats to EBOV, their cells support replication of this virus at levels similar to those of MARV. expression of IFN- and IFN- was detected in MARV-infected R06EJ cells. expression of IFN- was greater in MARV-infected cells than in EBOV-infected cells by 3.1- 0.55-fold (P 0.05) and 3.8- 0.83-fold (P 0.05) in infected cells. human cells showed inconsistent innate immune responses to wt EBOV and MARV-Uga(h) at 24 h postinfection, we observed an approximately 2-fold decrease, rather than increase, of IFN- and IFN- expression compared to control constitutive levels. at 48 h, there was only a 1.4- to 2.2-fold increase compared to the control (statistically insignificant) 769p cells demonstrated upregulation of ISG56 in response to infection with EBOV-Kik. MARV-Ang caused strong upregulation of ISG56 in both rousette cell lines and in human 769p cells as early as 24 h postinfection. wt EBOV suppresses innate immune responses in rousette cells more effectively than MARV-Uga(h) different strains of MARV showed a wide variability in response. the map includes genes involved in innate immune responses. uninfected wt EBOV MARV-Uga(h) triggered little to no innate immune response in rousette cells at selected time points. most of these genes showed a moderate increase of expression (2- to 4-fold), but IFIT1 was the clear leader. expression of IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, and IFN- was minimal and showed no significant changes. b *, IFNGR type not specified; **, other cell lines tested did not express detectable amounts of IFN- mRNA. we then determined whether the EBOV IIDs exhibit innate immune antagonistic functions in rousette and human cells. FN- (10.1- to 14.7-fold; P 0.05), ISG54 (6.4- to 19.4-fold; P 0.05), and IFN- (4.39- to 231.8-fold; P 0.01) expression levels of these genes continued to increase. at 48 h, expression levels of these genes in the cells infected with either virus were similar. significant for EBOV/VP35m/VP24m; P 0.05) and IFN- (190- to 223.5-fold; P 0.001) compared to infection with wt EBOV. other human cell line tested, 293T, demonstrated a lower induction of the innate immune response to the EBOV mutants. the VP35 IID but not VP24 IID promotes EBOV replication in rousette and human cells. we compared viral titers in cells infected with the mutated EBOV. eGFP+ RoNi/7 cells were the least permissive to EBOV among cell lines. bat IFNs suppress filovirus replication; the antifilovirus effects of bat and human IFNs are host species specific. the levels of expression of the innate immune genes were analyzed by qRT-PCR. viral titers in culture medium collected 48 h postinfection decreased by only 2.1- 0.6-fold and 2.4- 1.1-fold. transfection of both human cell lines with human type I IFNs decreased virus replication significantly. human cells transfected with bat IFN- did not show any decrease in virus replication either. bat type I IFNs suppress filovirus infection in human cells. monolayers in six-well plates were transfected with human IFNs. however, transcriptome analysis revealed only a few reads for IFN receptor genes in R06EJ, HepG2 and 293T cells. studies have demonstrated that Egyptian rousette bats support productive infection, with broad tissue distribution and shedding, with MARV but not EBOV. the resistance of these bats to EBOV does not result from the inability of EBOV to infect their cells. a recent report documented an increase of IFN- but not IFN- expression in rousette cells. however, we observed low constitutive expression levels of IFN- in rousette cells. the threshold cycle values of IFN- and IFN- obtained in qRT-PCR were similar. the strains to different bat species are documented for other bat-borne viruses, such as rabies (50) and paramyxoviruses (51). however, 48 h postinfection with all wild-type filoviruses increased expression of IFN-stimulated genes. in human cells, no response at 24 h was detected, with exception of MARV-Uga(b) in 769p cells. OV and EBOV/VP24m suggested an important role of the VP35 IID for EBOV replication in bat cells. the absence of such effect might be due to the relatively high virus doses used in our experiments. MARV-Uga(h) stimulated IFN- expression in these cells. transfection of human cells with human IFN- and IFN- resulted in a stronger upregulation of IFN-stimulated genes and suppressed filovirus replication. despite the strong induction of ISG54 and ISG56 by bat IFN- and IFN- in HepG2 cells, they failed to reduce viral replication. FN- expression was dramatically increased in the cells infected with EBOV/VP35m, EBOV/VP35m/VP24m, and MARV-Uga(h) at 48 h postinfection. a more moderate increase of IFN- expression was detected in RoNi/7 cells at this time. rousette bats mount robust innate immune responses to filovirus infection. filovirus IIDs are active in both rousette and human cells. the VP35 IID plays a greater role in control of filovirus infections in rousette nonimmune cells than in human cells. the human immortalized cell lines 293T (derived from an embryonal kidney) were maintained in DMEM, HepG2 in MEM, and 769p in RPMI 1640 (Life Technologies, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) the human immortalized cell lines 293T (derived from an embryonal kidney but possibly having an adrenal or neuronal origin reference [60]. EBOV strain 199510621, also known as Kikwit (referred to as EBOV-Kik) was isolated from a human in the Democratic Republic of Congo during the 1995 outbreak (61) and underwent three passages in vero E6 cells. MARV strain 200702854 Uganda was derived from an isolate obtained from an Egyptian rousette bat captured in Uganda in 2007 (63) mRNA sequences of genes involved in the innate immune response in Egyptian rousette bats were obtained from the CDC and deposited at the WRCEVA. a paper describing the transcriptome of Egyptian rousette bat was published (65). twenty clones encoding IFN-, 8 clones encoding IFN-, and 6 clones encoding IFN- were sequenced. the IFN- and IFN- sequences were identical in the clones. all 20 clones harboring at least one substitution. cell monolayers in six-well plates were washed twice with 1.0 ml of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; Mediatech, Corning, Manassas, VA) and denatured in 0.8 ml of TRIzol reagent (Ambion, Thermo Fisher Scientific) after phase separation, the aqueous fraction was mixed with an equal volume of 100% ethanol. the concentration of the extracted RNA was FN- mRNA was detected in naive and mock-transfected R06EJ and RoNi/7 cells only. the expression changes could not be quantified accurately in many instances, particularly at 24 h postinfection. cells were infected with wt EBOV, EBOV/VP24m, EBOV/VP35m, EBOV/VP35m/VP24m, or MARV-Uga(h) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 PFU/cell. cells were washed three times with PBS, supplied with 2.0 ml of fresh medium, and incubated at 37\u00b0C in a 5% CO2 humidified atmosphere. cDNA libraries were created using random hexamers and ligated with NEXTflex RNA-Seq barcodes. cDNA fragments of 75 to 80 nucleotides were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. each read from the experiment was mapped to this set of bat transcripts. an absolute natural log ratio of 0.2 was used as the cutoff. all work with EBOV and MARV was performed within the Galveston National Laboratory biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratories. human immortalized cell lines 293T (derived from an embryonal kidney but possibly having an adrenal or neuronal origin reference [60]) mutant EBOV/VP24m (substitution K142A in the VP24 gene), EBOV/VP35m (substitution R312A in the VP35 gene) and the double mutant EBOV/VP35m/VP24m (substitution R312A in the VP35 gene) the virus was recovered as described previously (15, 16) using the full-length clone kindly provided by Jonathan Towner and Stuart Nichol. MARV strain 200501379 Angola was isolated from a human during the outbreak in 2005 (64). the isolates EBOV-Kik, MARV-Uga(h) and MARV-Ang originally were obtained from the Special Pathogens Branch, CDC, and deposited at the World Reference Center of Emerging Viruses and Arboviruses. twenty clones encoding IFN-, 8 clones encoding IFN-, and 6 clones encoding IFN- were sequenced. expression of human IFNs was confirmed by western blotting. IFN-, IFN-, IFN-, ISG54, ISG56, IFN-, MAVS, and STAT1 were designed using Primer Express 3.0 software (sequences can be provided upon request) for RNA extraction, cell monolayers in six-well plates were washed twice with 1.0 ml of 0.1 M phosphate-buffered saline. all bat genes of interest produced suitable CT values for quantitative interpretation except IFN- and IFN-. the IFN- mRNA was detected in naive and mock-transfected R06EJ and RoNi/7 cells only. cells were seeded in six-well plates at a density that ensured formation of 80 to 90% confluent monolayers in 24 h. cells were infected with wt EBOV, EBOV/VP24m, EBOV/VP35m, EBOV/VP35m/VP24m, or MARV-Uga(h) at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 2 PFU/cell. cDNA libraries were created using random hexamers and ligated with NEXTflex RNA-Seq barcodes. cDNA fragments of 75 to 80 nucleotides were sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq 500. each read from the experiment was mapped to this set of bat transcripts. the expression values were normalized to the total number of reads mapping to mRNA transcripts. each sample had a total of 10 million reads. an absolute natural log ratio of 0.2 was used as the cutoff."}
