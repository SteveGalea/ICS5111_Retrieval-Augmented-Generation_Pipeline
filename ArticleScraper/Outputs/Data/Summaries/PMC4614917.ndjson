{"summary": "two short peptide domains formed by an amino acid hexamer and octamer are conserved in the RRM regions1,2. both proteins contain 3 RNA-recognition motives (RRM) and an auxiliary domain in rich-asparagine and glutamine residues (Q-rich domain) TIA1a isoform (43 kDa) differs from isoform TIA1b (40 kDa) by inclusion of an 11 amino acid residue sequence at the beginning of the RRM2 motif. isoform TIARa (50 kDa) differs from isoform TIARb (42 kDa) in that it contains a sequence of 17 amino acids between the RNP2 and RNP1 motifs in RRM1, encoded by structural topology and functional contribution of each of the 3 RRM domains in both TIA1 and TIAR proteins has been the subject of investigations by several laboratories. no high resolution structure of TIA protein RRM domain in complex with oligonucleotide has yet been reported. RNAs and proteins in cell physiology define their fates into ribonucleoprotein complexes such as speckles, paraspeckles, messenger ribonucleo/cytoplasmic RNA-protein complexes. first evidence for the involvement of TIA proteins in transcriptional regulation came from the functional capacity of TIA proteins to bind DNA and the carboxyl-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II. TIA proteins facilitated the recognition between weak 5\u2032 splice-acceptor sites and degenerate sequences for the hybridization of the RNA complementary to U1 snRNP. the recognition motif RRM2 in the TIA protein, facilitated by RRM3, attaches to the uridine-rich regions proximal to the intron's 5\u2032 splice site, and the Q-rich domain binds to the N-terminal region of the sub TIA proteins regulate 10% of the constitutive and alternative splicing events in the human genome, whereas 20% was initially estimated by an in silico approach. translation of mRNAs TIA antigens have the ability to regulate and/or modulate the process of cellular translation by limiting the availability of the ribosomal machinery. inactive translation pre-initiation complexes associated with mRNAs accumulate in the cytoplasm and bind among themselves (self-aggregate), creating large foci of mRNA and protein known as stress granules. SG formation favors cell survival in stress conditions such as starvation or limitations in amino acid availability, oxidative or osmotic stress, etc. immunoprecipitation studies on RNA-protein complexes and identification of immunoprecipitated mRNAs have allowed the identification of approximately 2 hundred mRNAs associated with TIA1 and/or TIAR. the participation of TIA proteins in the translational regulation of different mRNAs. degradation from the 3\u2032 end is mediated by the exosome and is produced by the shortening or deadenylation of the poly(A+) tail of the mRNA and the subsequent recruitment of exonucleases. the mRNA regions implicated in this process are sequences rich in adenosine and uridine (ARE sequences) situated in the 3\u2032-UTR. miRNA-579 and miRNA-125b interact with TIAR in the 3\u2032-UTR of TNF mRNA, leading to its degradation and a decrease in its translation. 365 miRNAs have been identified whose target mRNAs are related to organ development, survival and differentiation, and also with the regulation of immune responses. TIA proteins facilitated the recognition between weak 5\u2032 splice-acceptor sites. the recognition motif RRM2 in the TIA protein attaches to the uridine-rich regions proximal to the intron's 5\u2032 splice site. the Q-rich domain binds to the N-terminal region of the subunit U1-C in U1 snRNP. TIA1 and TIAR preferentially bind to sequences rich in uridine and adenosine pentamers, UUUUA or AUUUU, proximal to the 5\u2032 splice-acceptor sites in the introns. they facilitate splicing of pre-mRNAs via improving the selection of constitutive and alternative splicing events in the human genome. phosphorylation abolishes the ability of eIF2B to exchange GDP for GTP. this leads to a decrease in the levels of eIF2-GTP-tRNAMet ternary complex. TIA1 and TIAR play a role, associating with complex formed by several canonical translational initiation factors. controversy exists regarding the process of SG formation mediated by TIA1 and/or TIAR. some studies suggest that TIAR cannot form SG without the aid of TIA1.45. however, other results show that only one of the 2 proteins is sufficient for SG formation. kines, 52,53 Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2),54 mitochondrial cytochrome c,55 C-MYC oncogene,56 Hypoxia inducible factor 1, subunit (HIF-1),57 -actin subunit,58 some isotype of tubulin,59 some mRNAs implicated in the cell-cycle G2/M transition and DNA repair. breast cancer 1 (BRCA1)61 and Programmed cell death 4 (PDCD miRNAs are small RNA fragments, 19\u201324 nucleotides in length, that regulate gene expression through base-pairing with complementary sequences. the interaction of miRNA with mRNA leads to the recruitment of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) around 20\u201330% of gene expression is regulated by miRNAs. TIA1 and TIAR expression,71,72 and adenovirus VA RNA-derived miRNAI-138 targets TIA1.73. the multifunctional capacity of TIA proteins to regulate/modulate gene expression points to a relevant role for these regulators/modulators in cellular homeostasis. gene-wide profiling suggests a specific upregulation of p53 signaling pathway-related genes. a role for TIA1 in autophagy via interaction with annexin A7 has been described in vascular endothelial cells. the surviving mice did not show any apparent abnormalities until the end of their lifespan (2 years) the surviving mice did not show any apparent abnormalities until the end of their lifespan (2 years), which was characterized by a phenotype associated with arthritis51. however, mice lacking TIAR presented different phenotypes that were dependent on the mouse strain studied. PKR kinase is activated and phosphorylates eIF2, inhibiting the translation of cellular and viral proteins by directing the mRNAs to SG. PKR kinase is activated and phosphorylates eIF2, inhibiting the translation of cellular and viral proteins by directing the mRNAs to SG, and increasing the expression of proteins involved in the innate immune response to guarantee cell viability. TIA1 is regulated throughout the menstrual cycle, TIA1 modulates the expression of immune factors in endometrial cells. cytotoxicity mediated by TIA proteins and TIA1 as a component of cytotoxic T lymphocyte granules. mutated TIA1 has been found in corpus uteri, kidney, brain, lung, stomach, and breast tumors. mutated TIAR/TIAL1 has been identified in oropharynx, stomach, liver, lung, breast, corpus uteri, ovary and brain tumors. this suggests a putative role for TIA proteins in preventing tumorigenic processes. e32,56 and tumor suppressor gene BRCA1,61 the splicing of FGFR2,25 FAS26,27 or the tumor suppressor genes Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1)31 and Wilms' tumor suppressor (WT1),122 mRNA stability of tumor suppressor gene PDCD462 or Growth arrest and DNA-damage-inducible protein 45 (GADD45),124. low expressions of TIA1 and/or TIAR correlate with welander distal myopathy (WDM; MIM #604454) is a distal muscular dystrophy, autosomal, dominant and late. symptoms usually begin with weakness of the extender of the index fingers. symptoms usually begin with weakness of the extender of the index fingers. TIA1 mutation in WDM was associated with alterations in the alternative pre-mRNA splicing of SMN2133 and in the second study with the dynamics of the formation of stress granules. the first experimental evidence for the participation of these proteins in the regulation of the cell death program came from the observation that incubation of (permeabilized) cellular targets with TIA1 and TIAR proteins triggered nuclear DNA fragmentation. decreasing the expression of TIA proteins in the chicken cell line DT40 -lymphoma promotes a decline in their growth relative to control cells. however, short- or long-term reduction in TIA1 or TIAR expression leads to an increase in cell proliferation associated with a tumorigenic phenotype. this behavior has also been reported in other human cell lines including K562 (myeloma),56 HCT116 (colorectal carcinoma),83 HEK2 the absence of TIAR expression was embryonic lethal in 100% of offspring. in C57BL/6 mice, the lack of TIAR led to death in 90% of the embryos. an essential role for TIAR has been described in self-renewal. some viruses benefit from TIA proteins to favor their own biology. TIA proteins can also act as potent antiviral agents independently of SG formation. TIA1 and TIAR function as gene suppressors in arthritis. TIA1 expression in eutopic and ectopic endometrium was reduced compared with TIA1 expression in eutopic endometrium of unaffected control women. down-regulation of TIA-1 resulted in elevated IL-6 and TNF- expression, whereas TIA-1 overexpression resulted in decreased IL-6 and TNF- expression. apoptosis mediated by cytotoxic T-lymphocytes provokes the mutated TIA1 has been found in corpus uteri, kidney, brain, lung, stomach, and breast tumors. mutated TIAR/TIAL1 has been identified in oropharynx, stomach, liver, lung, breast, corpus uteri, ovary and brain tumors. TIA proteins regulate, modulate and/or interact with a large number of mRNAs involved in cell proliferation control. angiogenic factors, such as TNF, COX-2, VEGF, IL-8 or HIF1 16,51,52,54,57,86 and metastatic factors including MMP13.5. studies of TIA1 and/or TIAR expression in a cohort of human epithelial tumors showed a significant reduction in these proteins, pointing to a putative role for TIA1 and/or TIAR as tumor suppressors. the defect has been associated with a single mutation in chromosome 2p13 in all patients of Swedish and Finnish origin. in the first study, the TIA1 mutation in WDM was associated with alterations in the alternative pre-mRNA splicing of SMN2133 and in the second study with the dynamics of the formation of stress granules. environment regulate/modulate gene expression in eukaryotic cells. some progress has been made in studies on regulatory and functional properties of TIA proteins. recent technical advances will help to provide reference meta-analyses. a clearer understanding of the mechanisms controlling cell fate determination by TIA proteins may lead to the identification of novel molecular targets. a clearer understanding of the mechanisms controlling cell fate determination by TIA proteins may lead to the identification of novel molecular targets, which could selectively sensitize cancer cells to cell death. do laboratory is supported by the Spanish Ministry Economic Affairs and Competitiveness through FEDER funds (BFU2008\u201300354, BFU2011\u201329653 and BFU2014\u201357735-R). the CBMSO receives an institutional grant from Fundaci\u00f3n Ram\u00f3n Areces."}
