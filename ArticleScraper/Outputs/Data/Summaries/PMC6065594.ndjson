{"summary": "pathogens have developed mechanisms or virulence factors enabling them to disrupt and evade host defenses without predisposing factors. morphological changes will vary from mild circulatory changes such as mucosal or pulmonary edema and congestion to severe mucosal or pulmonary inflammation. these pathological changes will impair the normal homeostasis and manifest clinically as respiratory dysfunction. morphological changes are most commonly evaluated by cytology. histopathology specimens obtained during necropsy are considered the best resource for pathogenesis studies and in situ detection of agents associated with local changes. some of the important viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic causes of infectious respiratory disease in dogs. interleukin-10 impairs antifungal functions of phagocytes, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and protective cell-mediated immunity. these functions may be beneficial during resolution of the inflammatory response after infection is cleared. hematoxylin and eosin-stained photomicrograph of Rhinosporidium seeberi endospore and sporangia. treatment is focused on topical antifungal treatments, which may be supplemented with systemic antifungals. clinical signs include wheezing, sneezing, unilateral seropurulent nasal discharge, epistaxis, and possibly a visible mass within the nares. some authors suggest hunting and roaming dogs are at increased risk due to increased exposure to these factors. endospores are round, eosinophilic to magenta to basophilic bodies that are 5\u201315 m in diameter with internal eosinophilic globules. the preferred method of treatment for nasal rhinosporidiosis is surgical excision of lesions; however, there have been reports of slowly progressive recurrence after surgery. mycotic rhinitis Fungal rhinitis is most commonly caused by ubiquitous soil fungi, notably Aspergillus fumigatus. presenting signs include mucopurulent discharge (initially unilateral), sneezing, epistaxis, nasal depigmentation or ulceration. interleukin-10 impairs antifungal functions of phagocytes, secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, and protective cell-mediated immunity. virulence factors have been studied in vitro and may contribute to the disease by interfering with innate host defenses. rotic tissue admixed with fibrin is heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells with fewer macrophages. the underlying lamina propria is heavily infiltrated with lymphocytes and plasma cells with fewer macrophages. researchers have investigated using antifungal creams into the nasal sinuses to act as a local depot of drug therapy. extensive rhinoscopic debridement of the cavities before drug infusion is also important in improving treatment outcome. the parasite is endemic in India, Sri Lanka, and Argentina. sporangia are not often seen in cytology as they do not exfoliate readily. the preferred method of treatment for nasal rhinosporidiosis is surgical excision of lesions. canine parainfluenza virus, canine adenovirus type 2 (CAV-2) and Bordetella bronchiseptica are the most commonly isolated agents. Morphological changes are nonspecific and include mucosal hyperemia and swelling from edema fluid and glandular secretions. etiologic agents include canine parainfluenza virus, canine reovirus type 1, 2, and 3. new viruses have emerged as novel pathogens of the canine respiratory tract including canine influenza virus (CIV), group 1 canine coronavirus (canine pantropic coronavirus), group 2 canine coronavirus (canine respiratory coronavirus),26 and pneumovirus. the role of these pathogens as causes of ITB is still under debate. histological changes are confined to the trachea and bronchi. tracheal and bronchial lumens can be occluded by abundant mucoid material intermixed with neutrophils and bacterial colonies. most common diagnostic routine is based on the presence of clinical signs. antitussives with codeine derivatives such as hydrocodone or butorphanol are used to control persistent nonproductive coughing. bronchodilators such as theophylline and aminophylline may be used to prevent bronchospasm and therefore act as effective cough suppressants. bacterial bronchopneumonias are histologically characterized by bronchial, bronchiolar, and alveolar lumina that are filled with numerous neutrophils, macrophages, and fibrin with occasional areas of hemorrhage. there is minimal visible exudate within airspaces unless a secondary bacterial pneumonia has developed. canine influenza CIV is considered an emerging disease and has a fairly recent history. since the 1970s, studies confirmed that dogs could be experimentally infected with human H3N2.45 Prior to 2004, influenza was not considered a specific canine disease. dogs were also not considered reservoirs for influenza because they did not maintain their influenza subtype. with the H3N8 infection described a highly contagious respiratory disease, with high morbidity (reaching 60%\u201380%) and low mortality (1%\u20135%). however, mortality rates reached 36% in the first report within the Florida greyhound population. the peracute \u2013 and fatal \u2013 presentation is characterized by severe pulmonary, pleural, and mediastinal hemorrhage, and may be the result of a secondary bacterial infection. the pathogenesis of CIV does not vary significantly from other influenza subtypes affecting mammals. canine coronavirus was first detected in the united kingdom in 2003 from the trachea and lung tissues of dogs. this virus is closely related to human and bovine coronaviruses and distinct from canine enteric coronavirus. it is likely that infection with this virus only induces subclinical or mild respiratory disease. the gastrointestinal tract, nervous system, and respiratory system were affected. postmortem examination showed extensive lobar bronchopneumonia compromising the cranial and caudal lobes. there is no current vaccine, and there is no cross protection with gastrointestinal coronavirus. common histopathologic findings include severe suppurative and hemorrhagic bronchopneumonia characterized by diffuse alveolar neutrophilic infiltration, abundant hemorrhage and edema. pulmonary lesions are accompanied by necrosuppurative bronchitis and tracheitis. in the united kingdom, serological, immunohistochemical, and molecular retrospective studies have linked outbreaks of respiratory diseases in English foxhounds with equine influenza virus. in the united kingdom, serological, immunohistochemical, and molecular retrospective studies have linked outbreaks of respiratory diseases in English foxhounds. in 2004, a dog with severe respiratory signs was reported in Thailand. the virus isolated from the dog was closely related to the high pathogenicity avian influenza virus H5N1 recovered from viruses from avian influenza outbreaks. the pathogenesis of CIV does not vary significantly from other influenza subtypes affecting mammals. the virus replicates in the epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract causing epithelial necrosis, followed by neutrophilic infiltration and later infiltration of airways with mononuclear inflammatory cells. canine coronavirus was first detected in the united kingdom in 2003 from the trachea and lung tissues of dogs. this virus is closely related to human and bovine coronaviruses and distinct from canine enteric coronavirus. the seroprevalence varies from 54.7% in the united states to 17.8% in Japan. zooepidemicus is an important pathogen of horses and pigs but has recently been linked to cases of acute fatal pneumonia in dogs in several countries. there is insufficient data to determine the pathogenesis of S. equi subspecies zooepidemicus in dogs. clinical isolates seem to be sensitive to the following antimicrobial agents: cefalotin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, tetracycline, trimethoprim/sulfadiazine, enrofloxacin, marbofloxacin, and penicillin G. H. capsulatum is a dimorphic fungus that exists as a mold (saprophytic phase) at temperatures of 25\u00b0C\u201330\u00b0C characterized by septate hyphae with microconidia and macroconidia. most cases in the united states occur in river valleys of the Ohio, Missouri, and Mississippi rivers. in dogs with chronic complaints of respiratory disease, lameness, and/or neurologic signs, C. immitis infection should be suspected. cytology, histopathology, and culture approach a specificity of nearly 100% depending on the expertise of the pathologist and laboratory. the nodules are characterized microscopically by granulomatous inflammation containing epithelioid macrophages. many containing numerous H. capsulatum organisms, multinucleated giant cells, and fewer neutrophils, plasma cells, and lymphocytes. treatment of fungal pneumonia involves the use of azole drugs (itraconazole, ketoconazole, or fluconazole) and/or amphotericin B.83,88,91,105 is preferred for the treatment of B. dermatitidis83,106 and H. capsulatum infections. chitin synthase inhibitors (nikkomycin Z and caspofungin), terbinafine (a naftifine analog), and newer azoles (voriconazole and posaconazole) are being investigated for treatment of fungal infections. some advocate the addition of anti-inflammatory doses of glucocorticoids in order to decrease secondary inflammation associated with the death of fungal organisms. O. osleri inhabits the distal trachea, tracheal bifurcation, and first-division bronchi within granulomatous nodules on the mucosal surface. the life cycle is direct with transmission occurring through the saliva from the dam to pups during maternal grooming. trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles causing chronic cough. wild canids, such as foxes and coyotes, serve as definitive hosts. first-stage larvae are passed in the feces after being coughed up and swallowed. 113,120,121 Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of first-stage larvae in feces or transtracheal wash samples. success has been commonly achieved with oral fenbendazole;120\u2013123 administration of febantel, milbemycin oxime, levamisole, and diethylcarbamazine have also been used. treatment for F. hirthi include oral administration of fenbendazole,125\u2013127 5 days of oral albendazole, which is repeated 3 weeks later,105 or subcutaneous ivermectin. Sporadic cases have been reported in the united states, Canada,128 and various countries in Europe. paragonimus kellicotti is an uncommon disease that is caused by a trematode infestation in the lungs of dogs and other mammals. there are over 40 species of Paragonimus that have been described worldwide132 and are endemic in Asia, the Americas, and Africa. finitive diagnosis is based on identification of characteristic eggs in bronchial mucus, feces,113 or fine-needle aspiration of lung nodules. the eggs may be seen radiographically as early as 2\u20133 weeks postinfection137 or by computed tomography examination 30\u2013180 days postinfection. O. osleri inhabits the distal trachea, tracheal bifurcation, and first-division bronchi within granulomatous nodules on the mucosal surface. the life cycle is direct with transmission occurring through the saliva from the dam to pups during maternal grooming or regurgitation of food. benzimidazoles (fenbendazole, thiabendazole, oxfendazole), or off-label use of macrocyclic lactones (ivermectin and doramectin), subcutaneously.114\u2013116,118,119 Surgery to debulk large, obstructive masses may be considered. 113,120,121 Definitive diagnosis is made by detection of first-stage larvae in feces or transtracheal wash samples. in comparison to O. osleri, C. vulpis is found more often within the bronchi, endoscopically, and accompanied by erythema. treatment for F. hirthi include oral administration of fenbendazole,125\u2013127 5 days of oral albendazole, which is repeated 3 weeks later,105 or subcutaneous ivermectin. Sporadic cases have been reported in the united states, Canada,128 and various countries in Europe. paragonimus kellicotti is an uncommon disease that is caused by a trematode (fluke) infestation in the lungs of dogs and other mammals. there are over 40 species of Paragonimus that have been described worldwide132 and are endemic in Asia, the Americas, and Africa. 105,112,113,133 Definitive diagnosis is based on identification of characteristic eggs in bronchial mucus, feces,113 or fine-needle aspiration of lung nodules. the eggs are typically oval, yellow-brown, and operculated with a thickened ridge in the shell wall along the operculum. the cyst is thick-walled, spherical to ovoid to crescent-shaped, 4\u20138 um in diameter, and contains up to eight pleomorphic sporozoites. the trophozoite is thin-walled, 1\u20134 um in diameter, and appears to be an extracystic form of the sporozoite. ethionate or the combination of trimethoprim and sulfonamide has been used for successful treatment of pneumocystosis. other drugs have been used include carbutamide, trimetrexate, and combinations of clindamycin, primaquine, dapsone, and trimethoprim."}
