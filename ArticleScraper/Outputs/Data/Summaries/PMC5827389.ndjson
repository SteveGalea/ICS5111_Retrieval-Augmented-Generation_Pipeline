{"summary": "paramyxoviruses are a group of enveloped viruses with nonsegmented, single-stranded negative-sense RNA genomes. these include measles virus (MeV), emerging viruses such as Nipah virus (NiV) and Hendra virus (1). the immune response to paramyxoviruses is first launched through activation of the type I interferon (IFN) response (4). the RLR family consists of three proteins: RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP2. all three family members are cytoplasmic receptors that contain ATP-dependent RNA helicase domains (15\u201317) all three family members are cytoplasmic receptors that contain ATP-dependent RNA helicase domains. paramyxoviruses have a mechanism for RIG-I inhibition (28\u201331, 33) there are conflicting reports on whether or not paramyxoviruses have a mechanism for RIG-I inhibition (14) there is some evidence that paramyxoviruses may have a mechanism for RIG-I inhibition (14) TRIM25 polyubiquitinates RIG-I at lysine 172 (40) ubiquitin chain synthesis is thought to stabilize RIG-I oligomerization (42, 43) TRIM25 synthesizes free K63-linked polyubiquitin chains that associate with RIG-I (41, 43) coexpressed NiV V relocalized into condensed cytoplasmic puncta. this corresponds to the subcellular distribution of TRIM25. 293T cells were transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-NiV V and V5-GST. TRIM25 CCD-V5 expression constructs were included. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-NiV V or HA-NiV Vn, together with full-length TRIM25-V5, GST-V5, or TRIM25 CCD-V5. the eluant was immunoblotted against V5, HA, and TRIM25. an immunoblot assay of WCE done to confirm expression is shown. 293T cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing GST-NiV V CTD and TRIM25-V5 or TRIM25 CCD-V5. an immunoblot assay of WCE done to confirm expression is shown. all of the experiments shown are representative of three repeats. 293T cells were transfected with an HA-NiV V, GST-NiV V CTD, or HA-NiV Vn expression construct. the NiV V protein interacts with RIG-I in a manner dependent on the V C terminus. flag-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated, and eluants were immunoblotted against the Flag and HA tags. lysates were immunoprecipitated against the HA tag and HA-PIV5 V was shown to coprecipitate with TRIM25. all of the experiments shown are representative of three repeats. the interaction is conserved across V proteins representing all paramyxovirus genera. a similar experiment performed with HA-NiV V and HA-PIV5 V showed that NiV V and PIV5 V both coprecipitated with RIG-I but not with controls. once again, PIV5 V coprecipitation appeared weaker and less robust in experimental repeats (more than three) these V proteins are representative of different genera in the paramyxovirus family. flag-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated, and the eluant was immunoblotted against the HA tag. cells were transfected with a plasmid expressing HA-PIV5 V or HA-NiV V. the experiments were representative of three repeats. Mock-infected A549 cells were fixed; incubated with antibodies against MeV V and RIG-I, TRIM25, or MAVS protein. cells were stained with DAPI (blue channel) and stained with DAPI (blue channel) eluant was immunoblotted against meV V, RIG-I, TRIM25, NS1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. lysed cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the MeV V protein. all of the experiments shown are representative of three repeats. construct does not include the region in the helicase domain that is analogous to the V-binding domain in MDA5. RIG-IN contains both the site of TRIM25\u2013RIG-I binding and the site of ubiquitination by TRIM25 (lysine 172) (40) V proteins interact with RIG-I via the V C terminus and the RIG-I CARDs. this suggests a possible three-partner interaction of the V C terminus, the TRIM25 SPRY domain, and the RIG-I CARDs. YN-NiV V and YN-TRIM25 were able to interact and reconstitute YFP, resulting in yellow fluorescence (Fig. 6D). if the two partners interact, the constructs will reconstitute YFP and yield yellow fluorescence. YN-NiV W and RIG-I fused to the C terminus of YFP (YC\u2013RIG-I) cells were stained with anti-RIG-I and anti-YN antibodies. lack of yellow fluorescence indicates no interaction between the RIG-I and NiV W proteins. YFP reconstitution indicated that NiV V does not disrupt the RIG-I/TRIM25 interaction. the protein was relocalized to cytoplasmic puncta that corresponds to RIG-I/TRIM25 complexes. yFP reconstitution indicated that NiV V does not disrupt the interaction. the presence of NiV V in the RIG-I/TRIM25 complex inhibits downstream RIG-I signaling. the first objective was to determine whether the presence of NiV V in the complex inhibits downstream RIG-I signaling. 293T cells were transfected with an IFN- firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. a constitutive Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid; and a construct expressing NiV V, NiV W, or dominant negative RIG-I. sixteen hours later, they were stimulated with total RNA purified from influenza virus-infected A549 cells, where indicated. the significance of TRIM25 enhancement with or without V was determined by Student t test (***, P 0.001) using an IFN- reporter system that requires TRIM25 overexpression to reach full activation. a small amount of RIG-IN expression plasmid is transfected into cells so as to weakly stimulate the IFN- reporter. the mutant construct retains the ability to inhibit RIG-I signaling. the mutant construct retains the ability to inhibit STAT1 binding is not required. it has been reported that overexpression of LGP2 can facilitate the inhibition of RIG-I signaling by V proteins. 293T cells were pretreated with IFN- to induce RLR expression. then transfected with siRNA targeting LGP2 or MDA5 or with a nontargeting control (CTRL) cells were harvested 48 h later and analyzed for MDA5 and LGP2 mRNA levels. 293T cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids as for panel C. unstimulated cells received an equal amount of RNA from mock-infected A549 cells. the results for no siRNA, nontargeting siRNA, and MDA5 siRNA treatment were not statistically distinguishable from one another. siRNA against LGP2 also had a significant effect on the RIG-I pathway; however, within the LGP2 siRNA-treated group, NiV V still appeared to attenuate the level of IFN induction caused by the coexpression of RIG-IN and TRIM25. Western blot analysis of eluants with an anti-GST antibody showed evidence of covalent modification of GST\u2013RIG-IN with ubiquitin. when NiV V was expressed, RIG-IN displayed loss of this ubiquitination pattern. we extended these results to the MeV and PIV5 V proteins. 293T cells were transfected as described for panel A but cotransfected with plasmids expressing HA-NiV V, HA-PIV5 V, and HA-MeV V as indicated. eluants were immunoblotted against GST to show covalent ubiquitin-modified species of GST\u2013RIG-IN as indicated. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-Ub, V5-TRIM25, GST, or GST\u2013RIG-IN. cells were also cotransfected with the empty vector or a plasmid expressing NiV V. eluants were immunoblotted against endogenous MAVS protein and GST. 293T cells were transfected with hemagglutinin (HA)-NiV V and V5-GST, TRIM25-V5, or TRIM25 CCD-V5 expression constructs. the TRIM25 CCD (coiled-coil domain) was included because this region is sufficient and necessary for the TRIM25-NS1 interaction. HA-NiV Vn was unable to interact with TRIM25, suggesting that the V- full-length TRIM25-V5 or a TRIM25 CCD-V5 expression construct is shown. the NiV V protein interacts with TRIM25 in a manner dependent on the V protein C terminus. the eluant was immunoblotted against endogenous TRIM25. NiV V CTD was immunoprecipitated with a specific V CTD antibody. the eluant was immunoblotted against the V5 and GST tags. we cotransfected 293T cells with an HA-NiV V, GST-NiV V CTD. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-NiV V or HA-NiV W. flag-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with antibodies against endogenous RIG-I. the V-TRIM25 interaction is conserved across paramyxoviruses. the interaction was cotransfected into 293T cells with HA-MeV V, HA-NiV V, HA-SeV V, or HA-NiV W. a similar experiment was also performed with parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV5) V. 293T cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing V5-TRIM25. HA-tagged proteins were immunoprecipitated, and the eluant was immunoblotted against TRIM25. an immunoblot assay of WCE done to confirm expression is shown. a549 cells were infected with a recombinant MeV (Edmonston strain) expressing GFP (45) and either fixed or lysed for immunofluorescence or immunoprecipitation assays. meV V protein coimmunoprecipitated with endogenous RIG-I and TRIM25. a549 cells were infected with meV-GFP (green channel) at an MOI of 0.05. cells were fixed and then incubated with anti-MeV V, anti-RIG-I, -TRIM25, or -MAVS protein antibodies. there is no colocalization in the MAVS protein-stained panel. lysed cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody against the MeV V protein. the eluant was immunoblotted against V, RIG-I, TRIM25, and GAPDH. all of the experiments shown are representative of three repeats. -IN contains both the site of TRIM25\u2013RIG-I binding and the site of ubiquitination by TRIM25 (lysine 172) (40). boxes highlight the RIG-IN construct used in some experiments, as well as the MDA5 minimal binding site for all paramyxovirus V proteins. TRIM25 SPRY domain (middle) suggests a possible three-partner interaction of the V C terminus, the TRIM25 SPRY domain, and the RIG-I CARDs. this suggests a possible three-partner interaction of the V C terminus, the TRIM25 SPRY domain, and the RIG-I CARDs. YN-NiV V and YN-TRIM25 were able to interact and reconstitute YFP, resulting in yellow fluorescence (Fig. 6C). YC-NiV V and YN-TRIM25 were able to interact and reconstitute YFP, yielding yellow fluorescence (Fig. 6D). the lack of yellow fluorescence (YFP) indicates no interaction between the RIG-I and NiV W proteins. cells were transfected with YN-NiV V and YC\u2013RIG-I. YFP reconstitution indicated that NiV V does not disrupt the RIG-I/TRIM25 interaction. under these conditions, the NiV V protein was relocalized to cytoplasmic puncta that corresponded to RIG-I/TRIM25 complexes. this suggests that NiV V relocalization into these puncta is likely driven by TRIM25. 293T cells were transfected with a firefly luciferase reporter plasmid. luciferase expression was quantified and normalized as a measure of IFN- promoter activation. this confirmed that the NiV V protein can inhibit RIG-I activation of IFN- production. normalized firefly luciferase activity was determined 36 to 40 h after DNA transfection. 293T cells were transfected in triplicate with the reporter plasmids described in panel A. proportion of NiV V plasmid was increased (from 250 to 1,000 ng) to explore dose-dependent effects. sized that the inhibition of RIG-I signaling occurred at the step involving TRIM25 activation of RIG-I. we used an IFN- reporter system that requires TRIM25 overexpression to reach full activation. a small amount of RIG-IN expression plasmid is transfected into cells so as to weakly stimulate the IFN- reporter. it has been reported that overexpression of LGP2 can facilitate the inhibition of RIG-I signaling by V proteins through inhibition of RIG-I oligomerization (34), but whether this is specific to RIG-I has been questioned (35). siRNAs targeting LGP2 and MDA5 were used to deplete the expression of these proteins and assess the effects on V-mediated inhibition of RIG-I. 293T cells were transfected with no siRNA, nontargeting siRNA, siMDA5, siLGP2 or a nontargeting control (CTRL) at 48 h after siRNA transfection, cells were cotransfected with plasmids expressing Flag\u2013RIG-IN or Flag-GFP and HA-NiV V. 293T cells were transfected with the reporter plasmids as for panel C. unstimulated cells received an equal amount of RNA from mock-infected A549 cells 16 h after DNA transfection. a mutant form of NiV V (R409A) was reported to be deficient in MDA5 binding. no significant difference was observed between the abilities of WT NiV V and NiV V R409A to inhibit RIG-I signaling. we hypothesized that V may be interfering with TRIM25-mediated enhancement of downstream RIG-I signaling. 293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing HA-Ub, V5-TRIM25, GST, or GST\u2013RIG-IN as indicated. eluants were immunoblotted against GST to show covalent ubiquitin-modified species of GST\u2013RIG-IN as indicated. eluants were immunoblotted against GST to show covalent ubiquitin-modified species of GST\u2013RIG-IN as indicated. a GST pulldown assay was performed, and eluants were immunoblotted against GST to show covalent ubiquitin-modified species of GST\u2013RIG-IN. plasmids expressing HA-Ub, V5-TRIM25, GST, or GST\u2013RIG-IN. eluants were immunoblotted against endogenous MAVS protein and GST. eluants were immunoblotted against endogenous MAVS protein and GST. the experiments in our present study provide clear evidence of interaction of TRIM25, RIG-I, and paramyxovirus V proteins. this interaction inhibits RIG-I signaling via TRIM25, which is an E3 ubiquitin ligase. the mechanism observed here for V-mediated interaction with, and inhibition of, RIG-I is distinct from that described for MDA5. yeast two-hybrid analysis has not detected a V\u2013RIG-I interaction (27, 29) it is possible that TRIM25 is such a factor. cocrystallization of V with RLRs has thus far been limited to the helicase domain of these proteins and did not include the CARDs. the discovery that V proteins interact with both RIG-I and TRIM25 lends itself to the idea that V proteins prevent the signaling pathway from progressing beyond the RIG-I\u2013TRIM25 interaction. paramyxovirus V proteins disrupt RIG-I activation by blocking RIG-I ubiquitination by TRIM25 so that RIG-I signaling cannot progress to interaction with the MAVS protein. despite these differences, the ultimate effects of the influenza A virus NS1, SARS N, and paramyxovirus V proteins are similar. paramyxovirus V proteins disrupt RIG-I activation by binding to TRIM25 and RIG-I via their CTDs. this prevents RIG-I ubiquitination by TRIM25 such that RIG-I signaling does not progress to interaction with MAVS protein. novel mechanism, independent of other signaling inhibition activities of the V proteins, serves to ensconce V proteins among other multifunctional antiviral antagonists as key inhibitors of the innate immune response. all expression constructs were in the pCAGGS vector unless otherwise stated (52). the IFN- firefly luciferase reporter plasmid and the constitutive Renilla luciferase reporter plasmid were reported in prior work. NiV V R409A was produced from the NiV V plasmid by site-directed mutagenesis with the Agilent QuikChange II site-directed mutagenesis kit. sequences encoding YFP amino acids 1 to 154 (yn) and 155 to the end against the MAVS protein, LGP2, and MDA5, as well as nontargeting controls, were obtained from Dharmacon (MDA5, catalog no.
