{"summary": "respiratory diseases are a major contributor to morbidity and mortality in many tropical countries, including laos. emergence of sARS in 2003 followed by outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 in 2015. despite improvements in surveillance capacity for respiratory disease and influenza virus in many low- and middle-income countries, there remain many challenges and knowledge gaps. influenza (12%), parainfluenza viruses (9%), adenoviruses (6%), human metapneumovirus (6%), and corona viruses (4%) and human Bocavirus (HboV) were the main bacterial pathogens causing ALRI in hospitalized children. the national immunoization program (NIP) in laos has made considerable progress since 2009. laCoRIS is a community-based study that monitors the etiology and burden of respiratory disease among residents of this region. the project was initiated in 2015 as an extension of surveillance activities initially set up by coPanFlu project in 2009\u20132010. the primary objectives of the project were to measure the incidence rates of acute respiratory diseases and to identify their etiologic pathogens in metropolitan Vientiane. the suspected ILI cases were first identified using the WHO case definition as either > 37.5\u00b0C axillary temperature or > 38\u00b0C tympanic temperature with an associated respiratory symptom. a follow-up questionnaire was administrated to all ILI cases approximately 60 days following the disease onset. PCR positive cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae were serotyped for 40 different serotypes by using a novel multiplex real-time PCR assay. the method identifies the following serotypes: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6A/B, 6C, 7C, 7F, 8, 9N/L, 9V, 10A, 10F, 11A, 12F, 13, 14, 15A, 15B/C, 16F, 17F, 18F, 19 sputum was stained by Gram stain and the Kinyoun method for acid-fast bacilli. sputum was cultured on goat blood agar with an optochin disc, chocolate agar and Ashdown agar and broth for Burkholderia pseudomallei. three binary outcome variables were used, based on whether the participant experienced at least one episode of ILI, virus-positive ILI, and bacteria-positive ILI during the surveillance period. the final multivariate models were then derived through backwards, stepwise elimination of variables which did not retain statistical significance of P0.1 based on ANOVA. a household-level questionnaire was administered to collect data on socio-economic and potential exposure-related variables. individual-level data were collected on subject age, sex, pre-existing medical conditions and influenza vaccination history within the past 12 months. PCR positive cases of Streptococcus pneumoniae were serotyped for 40 different serotypes by using a novel multiplex real-time PCR assay. sputum specimens underwent bacterial culture according to the standard operating procedures of the Mahosot Hospital Microbiology Laboratory. potential pathogens were tested for antibiotic susceptibility by disk diffusion. beta-hemolytic streptococci were identified to Group level using the Oxoid Streptococcal Grouping Kit (Oxoid, Basingstoke UK) Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified by optochin susceptibility and bile solubility. three binary outcome variables were used, based on whether the participant experienced at least one episode of ILI, virus-positive ILI, and bacteria-positive ILI during the surveillance period. multivariate GLMM models included age group, sex, and SES by default. a total of 548 episodes of ILI were reported among 476 (9.7%) individuals from 330 (33.2%) households. a total of 548 episodes of ILI were reported among 476 (9.7%) individuals from 330 households. each participant reported 0.11 (range: 0\u20133) episodes of ILI, with a mean of 0.55 (range: 0\u20138) episodes per household. sore throat, headache and myalgia were reported by over 60% of cases respectively. males and young adults were significantly less likely to report ILI. 0 to 4 2.64 (1.63\u20134.27) 0.0001 3.55 (1.99\u20136.34) 0.0001 5.17 (2.48\u201310.8) 0.0001 5 to 14 2.44 (1.68\u20133.56) 2.03 (1.24\u20133.32) 4.47 (2.42\u20138.24) 25 to 34 0.77 (0.51\u20131.17) 0.82 (0.48\u20131.41) 0.85 (0.40\u20131.83) 35 to 44 1.01 (0.66\u20131.54) 1.08 (0.62\u20131.85) 1.17 3 cases (0.5%) were hospitalized for their respiratory illness. two had tested positive for Coronavirus 63, from the disease investigation. in the third patient no pathogens were detected. pneumoniae and burkholderia pseudomallei and acid-fast bacilli were not detected from any sample. influenza B (61 episodes), rhinovirus (49 episodes), influenza B (44 episodes) and coronavirus OC43 (40 episodes) were the main virus isolated from the nasal swabs. influenza B, coronaviruses, and parainfluenza viruses tended to be detected more frequently from January through March. highest incidence rates were found for Streptococcus pneumoniae (2.5, 95%CI: 1.88\u20133.11) followed by Staphylococcus aureus (1.44, 95%CI: 1.03\u20131.84), influenza A (1.20, 95%CI: 0.86\u20131.54) and B (1.00, 95%CI: 0.64\u20131.36), and rhino cidence of the most commonly detected pathogens by age-group. error bars represent -/+ standard errors. sex adjusted estimates for the overall Vientiane capital population. five clusters were due to influenza A/H3N2 virus, four were due to influenza B, while Parainfluenza 1, Parainfluenza 4, Rhinovirus and HMPV were each associated with a single cluster. Across these 14 household clusters, the \u201cindex cases\u201d were children (18 Y) in four clusters, and adults (18 Y) in eight clusters. the majority of Klebsiella sp. cultures (8/9 cultures; 88.9%) were resistant to ampicillin. the majority of Klebsiella sp. cultures (8/9 cultures; 88.9%) were resistant to ampicillin.

Streptococcus pneumoniae detection was significantly correlated with Hemophilus influenzae type B detection (Spearman\u2019s rho = 0.22; P0.001) but not with influenza viruses or Staphylococcus. aureus. we observed the presence of temporal patterns for the studied pathogens. the incidence of influenza A, coronavirus NL63, Staphylococcus aureus, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were highest among school-aged (5\u201314 years) children. the highest incidence rate was seen in those older than 45 years. clusters of Staphylococcus aureus infection excluded as typing of isolates was not conducted. interval period for onset of secondary cases within each cluster was less than 10 days in all but one cluster (18 days) the majority of Klebsiella sp. cultures (8/9 cultures; 88.9%) were resistant to ampicillin. of three H. influenzae cultures tested, 66.7% were resistant to ampicillin. this is the first community-based surveillance that prospectively monitored the incidence of ILI and its causative pathogens in Vientiane capital in lao PDR. a higher incidence of respiratory infections in lower SES households have been reported in several studies and is thought to be related to overcrowding. our estimate of ILI incidence of 0.11 episodes per person-year is very similar to the rate reported in a household surveillance study in Vietnam [34]. a known virus or bacterium was identified by the PCR-based assay in 65.1% of the 548 nasal swabs samples, and by microbial culture in 8.6% and 45.9% of throat and sputum specimens respectively. a previous in vivo study found that live attenuated influenza vaccine promotes colonisation by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus of the upper respiratory tracts of mice. previous studies reported no association between LAIV and nasal carriage of bacteria in humans. one observation of note was the complete absence of B. pseudomallei, which has previously been reported to cause a mild, self-limiting \u2018flu-like illness in northern Australia [43], in this population. coronaviruses found in children 0\u20134 and 5\u201314 years old respectively. highest rates of Streptococcus pneumoniae carriage are in general seen at 6 months to 3 years of age. inverse relationship has previously been observed between carriage of Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus. in the 14 potential household transmission events identified, the \u201cindex\u201d cases were children in less than half of the clusters. the findings are consistent with those of the household cohort study in Vietnam. however, the limitations of community-based ILI surveillance should be acknowledged. despite these limitations, our study has provided comprehensive insights on the etiology and incidence of ILI in laos. the major strength of this study is that it considered a much more comprehensive range of pathogens than is typically covered in ILI surveillance studies. the study could also have some direct benefits for the study population. incidence estimates are adjusted for the demographic structure of the Laos urban household population in 2015.
