{"summary": "crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) is a tick-borne virus that causes severe hemorrhagic fever with a mortality rate of 30% in more than 30 countries worldwide (1\u20134) there is no vaccine against CCHFV, and therapeutic interventions are limited. the increased tick vector population could be associated with climate change (7). hantavirus nucleocapsid protein (N protein) binds to the mRNA 5\u2032 cap and ribosomal protein S19. eIF4F complex engages the 43S preinitiation ribosome complex at the mRNA 5\u2032 cap. CCHFV-NP requires eIF4G to initiate translation. CCHFV-NP facilitates mRNA translation with the assistance of viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR. viral RdRp cleaves the host cell mRNA 6 to 16 nucleotides downstream of the 5\u2032 cap. capped oligoribonucleotide is attached to the viral mRNA 5\u2032 terminus. a 70-nucleotide-long 5\u2032 UTR composed of a 5\u2032-terminal nonviral 15 nucleotides representing the cap-snatched primer. the mRNA lacks the 3\u2032 UTR. the mRNA contains a nonviral 71-nucleotide-long 5\u2032 UTR and 268-nucleotide-long 3\u2032 UTR with a poly(A) tail. mRNA expressed from plasmids pCCHF G1, pCCHF G2 and pCCHF G3 contain the same 15-nucleotide-long nonviral sequence upstream of the 5\u2032 UTR. the exact sequence of the viral 5\u2032 UTR, nonviral UTR, and scrambled 5\u2032 UTR is shown in panel L. total RNA was purified from cells cotransfected with plasmids as previously reported. pCCHF G1 plasmid was replaced with pCCHF G2 (D) or pCCHF G3 (E) Western blot analysis showing expression levels of CCHFV NP and actin in cell lysates from panels D and E. the viral mutant 5\u2032 UTR sequence was used for Fig. 6. in negative-strand RNA viruses, the 3\u2032 terminus of mRNA molecules are usually truncated. the 3\u2032 terminus of CCHFV S-segment cRNA is 167 nucleotides in length. RNA 5\u2032 UTR was cotransfected with pCCHFG3 plasmid. heLa cells in 12-well plates again were cotransfected with pCCHFG3 plasmid. it is evident that increased NP expression did not support the translation of reporter mRNA harboring the randomized viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR. CCHF FL1, CCHF FL2, and CCHF FL3 transcripts were also present in transcripts expressed in cells from plasmids pCCHF G1, pCCHF G2 and pCCHF G3 respectively. luciferase (FLuc) control RNA containing both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 nonviral UTRs were also present in transcripts expressed in rabbit reticulocyte lysate. the radiolabeled mRNAs were incubated with the translation mix containing purified GST-NP. purified GST-NP did not affect the mRNA stability in the translation mix. CCHFV-NP, similar to hantavirus N protein, facilitates the translation of reporter mRNA containing the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR. CCHFV snatched 9- to 16-nucleotide-long capped RNA primers from host cell transcripts. the primers contained a C residue at the 3\u2032 terminus. CCHFV terminated transcription at the G residue located at the 126th position from the 5\u2032 terminus of S-segment vRNA. the reporter mRNAs used in Fig. 1 contained a 148-nucleotide-long 3\u2032 UTR of CCHFV S-segment mRNA. however, the 3\u2032 UTR of CCHFV S-segment mRNA is truncated by 126 nucleotides and is only 41 nucleotides in length. the 14-nucleotide-long cap-snatched sequence, luciferase mRNA had a viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR and a nonviral 3\u2032 UTR along with a poly(A) tail expressed from pCDLuc2 plasmid. the deletion selectively favored the translation of the resulting mRNA, expressed from pCDLuc2 plasmid, by the CCHFV-NP. cells were cotransfected with a fixed amount (100 ng) of pGL3 (blue), pCDLuc1 (red), or pCDLuc2 (green), along with increasing input concentrations of pCCHFV-NP. cell lysates were examined for luciferase expression, as described in Materials and Methods. a mixture of cells receiving NP expression plasmid, reporter plasmid, or both were analyzed in the experiments depicted in Fig. 1 and 3. it will be more accurate to specifically examine only those cells receiving both the NP expression construct and the reporter plasmid of interest. all mCherry-positive cells contain the CCHFV-NP. NP favors the translation of the downstream ORF. cells in 24-well plates were transfected with pCCHFG2 plasmid (B), cotransfected with pCCHFG2 and pmCherry plasmids (C) or cotransfected with pCCHFG2 and pNP-IRES-mCherry plasmids (D). cells were examined by flow cytometry 24 h posttransfection. the luciferase mRNA was either uncapped or capped during synthesis. both uncapped and capped mRNA were translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysates in the absence or presence of purified CCHFV-NP. the luciferase mRNA was either uncapped or capped during synthesis. CCHFV-NP binds to viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR with high affinity. binding of CCHFV-NP to viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR favors translation of downstream open reading frame. CCHFV-NP binds to the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR with 12-fold stronger affinity than scrambled. the CCHFV S-segment mRNA 5\u2032 UTR (A), scrambled 5\u2032 UTR (B), nonviral 5\u2032 UTR (C) and viral mutant 5\u2032 UTR (D) were synthesized by T7 transcription and biotinylated during synthesis. the biotinylated RNA was immobilized on a streptavidin biosensor. mutant (viral mutant 5\u2032 UTR; Fig. 1L) was synthesized by T7 transcription. CCHFV-NP bound to both of these UTRs with weaker affinity. mFold analysis revealed that the viral 5\u2032 UTR has strong hairpin secondary structure. CCHFV-NP does not require eIF4F complex to facilitate translation on capped mRNAs. eIF4F complex recruits 43S preinitiation ribosome complex by direct interaction between eIF4G and eIF3. hantavirus N protein facilitates mRNA translation without the requirement of eIF4F complex. 4E1RCat inhibits the interaction between eIF4G and eIF4E. the hantavirus N-mediated translation mechanism does not require eIF4F complex, as mentioned in the text. CCHFV-NP was detected using anti-His tag monoclonal antibody. reporter mRNA levels in cells from panels i, ii, and iii (x) and iv, v, and vi (xi) mRNA levels were quantified by real-time PCR (relative quantification method) 4E1RCat binds to eIF4E, disrupts the interactions between eIF4E and eIF4G, and prevents the formation of eIF4F complex on the mRNA 5\u2032 cap (26) as a result, the cap-dependent translation machinery of the host cell is shut down. the treatment of 4E1RCat failed to inhibit the translation of mRNA in SNV N protein-expressing cells. CCHFV-NP requires eIF4G to facilitate mRNA translation. the structural components of eIF4F complex (eIF4E, eIF4G, and eIF4A) physically exist in 4E1RCat-treated cells. human rhinovirus-16 2A protease specifically cleaves eIF4G and inhibits the cap-dependent host translation machinery. e was not rescued by CCHFV-NP (compare Fig. 8ii to 8iii, as well as 8vii to iii), demonstrating that CCHFV-NP requires the intact eIF4G to facilitate mRNA translation by an unknown mechanism. the lack of noticeable change in reporter mRNA levels demonstrates that changes observed in reporter expression occurred at the translational level. pF/HRV-16 2A expressing human rhinovirus 16 2A protease (ii and iii), pTriEX-mCherry (iv), or pTriEX-mCherry along with pF/HRV-16 2A (v and vi) reporter gene expression was observed under the microscope 24 h after the second transfection. the capped oligoribonucleotide is attached to the viral mRNA 5\u2032 terminus. the mRNA contains a truncated 3\u2032 UTR and lacks the 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. to our knowledge, these characteristic features are unknown for M and L segment-derived mRNAs. increased input concentrations of pCCHF-NP plasmid during transfection selectively increased the GFP signal in cells cotransfected with pCCHFG1 plasmid. increased input concentrations of pCCHF-NP plasmid during transfection selectively increased the GFP signal in cells cotransfected with pCCHFG1 plasmid. the total plasmid in each well was balanced to 1.0 g using empty-vector pcDNA 3.1(+) cells were harvested 24 h posttransfection, and total plasmid readout from each well was quantified by flow cytometry. three such averaged readouts from three independent experiments were further averaged. the exact sequences of viral, nonviral, and scrambled 5\u2032 UTRs are shown in panel L. mRNAs were translated in 50 l rabbit reticulocyte lysates in absence of either 50 nM or 100 nM purified GST-NP (filled bars) or GST (open bars) the 3\u2032 terminus of CCHFV S-segment cRNA (strain 10200) is 167 nucleotides in length. we deleted the 3\u2032-terminal 20 nucleotides of the 3\u2032 UTR. we incorporated the remaining 147 nucleotides downstream of the GFP stop codon. CCHFV-NP was cloned in the pGX4T3 backbone and expressed as an N-terminally glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged fusion protein. a similar strategy was used for cloning, expression, and purification of GST tag in Escherichia coli. transcripts were individually translated in rabbit reticulocyte lysate in absence of purified GST or GST-NP fusion protein. the addition of purified GST-NP in the translation mix selectively facilitated the translation of both CCHF FL1 and CCHF FL2 mRNAs. the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR alone is sufficient for NP-mediated translation. CCHFV S-segment genomic RNA contains 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of 167 and 55 nucleotides in length. the sequences at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini are complementary and likely undergo base pairing. the sequences at 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini are complementary and undergo base pairing. a hypothetical panhandle structure formed by the base pairing of complementary nucleotides at the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the viral genome. shown is the CCHFV S-segment vRNA having 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTRs of 167 and 55 nucleotides in length, respectively. the ORF sequence is shown by a blue line. luciferase reporter mRNA harbored the 55- and 41-nucleotide-long 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR sequences of CCHFV S-segment mRNA. the 14-nucleotide-long cap-snatched sequence was incorporated upstream of the 5\u2032 UTR to correctly mimic the cap-snatched sequence of viral mRNA. the impact of CCHFV-NP on the translation of these plasmids pCDLuc1, pCDLuc2, pCDLuc3 and pCDLuc4 were constructed. mRNA molecules expressed from these constructs were shown in panel L of Fig. 1. the luciferase reporter mRNA expressed from pCDLuc3 plasmid mimics the CCHFV S-segment mRNA. it has both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 viral mRNA UTR sequences of the correct size and 14-nucleotide-long nonviral sequence upstream of the 5\u2032 UTR mimicking the cap-snatched sequence. however, the randomization of 5\u2032 UTR sequence (pCDLuc4 plasm pCCHFG2 expresses the GFP reporter mRNA containing 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 viral UTR devoid of 3\u2032 poly(A) tail. pCCHFG3 plasmid expresses the same mRNA except the 5\u2032 UTR sequence was randomized. the cotransfected cells were examined by flow cytometry. cells were examined by flow cytometry 24 h posttransfection. mean GFP fluorescence values from panels A, B, C, and D were normalized relative to values for panel C. mRNA molecules expressed by plasmids pCCHFG2, pmCherry, pNP-IRES-mCherry, and pCCHFG3 are plotted in panel E. CCHFV-NP facilitated the translation of luciferase reporter mRNA. the luciferase mRNA 5\u2032 cap does not play a role in the CCHFV-NP-mediated translation strategy. CCHFV-NP also facilitated the translation of both capped and uncapped transcripts. the scrambled 5\u2032 UTR has the same nucleotide composition as the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR. CCHFV-NP binds to the viral UTR with 12-fold stronger affinity than scrambled UTR. the tight binding of CCHFV-NP with the viral UTR is consistent with favorable translation of reporter mRNA harboring the viral UTR. ified N-terminally His-tagged CCHFV-NP was passed over the immobilized RNA molecule at the indicated concentrations. the data points shown in panels A to D were fit to a 1:1 binding model for the calculation of association (Kass) and dissociation (Kdis) rate constants. the standard deviations (SD) were calculated from three independent experiments. filter binding analysis showed that CCHFV-NP bound to the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR with higher affinity than scrambled UTR, nonviral UTR, or the viral mutant 5\u2032 UTR. the results from filter binding analysis are consistent with the results from biolayer interferometry. hantavirus N protein binds to the ribosomal protein S19 (RPS19), a structural component of the 40S ribosomal subunit (19). monomeric and trimeric N protein molecules bind to the mRNA 5\u2032 cap and highly conserved triplet repeat sequence (UAGUAGUAG) of the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR. HEK293T cells seeded in 24-well plate were transfected with pTriEx1.1 empty vector (i, ii, iv, and v), pCCHFV-NP (iii) or pTriEX-mCherry plasmid. cells were again transfected with either pCCHFG2 plasmid (i to iii) or pTriEX-mCherry plasmid. HEK293T cells were cotransfected with pCCHFG2 plasmid expressing mCherry reporter mRNA harboring the CCHFV S-segment mRNA 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 UTR sequences. the reporter mRNA from pTriEx-mCherry plasmid is also preferentially translated by the SNV N protein (25). 4E1RCat failed to inhibit translation of mRNA in CCHFV-NP-expressing cells. this suggests that similar to hantaviruses, CCHFV-NP does not require eIF4F complex to facilitate translation of reporter mRNA. the 2A protease specifically cleaves eIF4G and inhibits the canonical host translation machinery (27\u201329) it plays important roles in virus replication (30\u201332) lack of noticeable change in reporter mRNA levels demonstrates that changes observed in reporter expression occurred at the translational level. the results from Fig. 8 clearly demonstrate that although the formation of eIF4G complex is not required for the CCHFV-NP-mediated translation strategy. i, ii, and iii (ix) and mCherry mRNA levels in cells from panels i to vi (x) were quantified by real-time PCR. it is evident from panels i to iii that expression of 2A protease resulted in the cleavage of eIF4G. strand RNA viruses such as CCHFV or hantaviruses manage the efficient synthesis of viral proteins during the course of infection. our results suggest that these viruses use their nucleocapsid proteins to preferentially engage the host translation machinery at the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR for efficient synthesis of viral proteins. the 3\u2032 UTR of CCHFV S-segment mRNA was 41 nucleotides in length. the mechanism for transcription termination at the 146th G residue from the 5\u2032 terminus of vRNA template remains unclear. luciferase reporter mRNA contained all structural features of S-segment mRNA. CCHFV-NP may selectively boost the translation of viral transcripts in virus-infected cells. this is consistent with previous reports that CCHFV-NP does not bind to the mRNA 5\u2032 cap (16) however, the high-affinity binding between CCHFV-NP and the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR is required for the NP-mediated translation strategy. CCHFV-NP simultaneously engages ribosomes on the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR. but it remains unclear how NP engages ribosomes on the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR. mRNA 5\u2032 UTR binds to both the viral mRNA 5\u2032 UTR and eIF4G. plasmid pmCherry has an IRES sequence upstream of the mCherry ORF. the plasmid was constructed by the incorporation of CCHFV-NP ORF upstream of the IRES sequence in the pmCherry plasmid. pTriEx-SNV and pTriEx-mCherry were constructed as previously reported (12). plasmid expressing CCHFV-NP from strain 10200 was a gift from Stuart T. Nichol (CDC, Atlanta, GA) the resulting plasmid was PCR amplified and cloned between NdeI and XhoI restriction sites in the pET30a backbone. the resulting plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli Rosetta cells. the eluted protein was quantified and stored in 100-l aliquots at 80\u00b0C. pGST-NP plasmid expressing NP with N-terminally fused GST tag was transformed into bacteria. expression and purification of GST-tagged NP was carried out as previously reported (12) the resulting PCR product was then cloned using a CCHF-specific forward primer downstream of the first forward primer and the same anchoring primer as the reverse primer. the plasmid was sequenced to read the 3\u2032 UTR of the CCHFV S-segment mRNA. CCHFV-NP was bacterially expressed and purified using an N-terminal His tag. CCHFV-NP was purified using an N-terminal His tag. the capped and uncapped luciferase mRNA molecules were synthesized by in vitro T7 transcription and labeled with [32-P]GTP during synthesis. the translation of the resulting mRNA was carried out in rabbit reticulocyte lysates. the same strategy was used for the construction of pCCHF G2 and pCCHF G3 constructs. the pCCHF-NP plasmid was subcloned in the pTriEX1.1 backbone. the plasmid pmCherry has an IRES sequence upstream of the mCherry ORF. the plasmids pTriEx-SNV and pTriEx-mCherry were constructed as previously reported. the plasmid pF/HRV-16 2A was generated as previously reported. the plasmid expressing CCHFV-NP from strain 10200 was a gift from Stuart T. Nichol. the bound NP was eluted with the elution buffer (50 mM Tris, 500 mM NaCl, 0.05% Triton X-100, and 30 mM imidazole) the eluted protein was quantified and stored in 100-l aliquots at 80\u00b0C. resulting pGST-NP plasmid expressing NP with N-terminally fused GST tag was transformed into bacteria. cDNA was ligated to the 3\u2032 end of the extracted RNA using a 5\u2032 DNA adenylation kit (NEB) the linked RNA was converted to cDNA using an anchoring primer complementary to the DNA linker sequence. the resulting PCR product was then cloned using a TA cloning kit. cells were harvested 48 h posttransfection and analyzed on a flow cytometer. 50,000 events for each sample were examined for GFP and mCherry expression. the mean GFP fluorescence value from cells positive for both mCherry and GFP expression was examined. the association and dissociation phases of each reaction cycle were analyzed by fitting the data into a 1:1 binding model using BLItz software. the CCHFV-NP used in these experiments was bacterially expressed and purified."}
