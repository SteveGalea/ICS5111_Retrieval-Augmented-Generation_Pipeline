{"summary": "FECV occurs in two pathotypes; feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) primarily replicates in lower portion of intestinal tract, spreads by fecal-oral route. feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) efficiently replicates in macrophages/monocytes. FECVs have three open reading frames (ORFs) in the ORF3abc region. fetus 4 cells originally purchased from the American Type Culture Collection were used for virus propagation, titration and virus neutralization tests. the cell line was maintained as monolayer culture in Dulbecco\u2019s Modified Eagle Medium (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 0.3 mg/ml glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, 0.25 g/ml streptomycin PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i is a derivate of PBFIPV-DF-2 that was re-engineered to contain the intact ORF3abc region of canine coronavirus. it was transfected into cat cells and cultivated for several generations before being used in this study. fecal swabs were collected at days 0, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and 42 p.i., and placed in 500 l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) after vortexing and 30 min incubation, the swabs were removed, and the extract was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min to remove cell debris. RNA was stored at -80\u00b0C until used to measure copy numbers of the genome and replicative forms of CoVs. two TaqMan-based quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) assays targeting the 5\u2032 end of the FIPV DF-2 genome and the N gene subgenomic (sg) mRNA were applied. the FCoV EIA Kit, (BV European Veterinary Laboratory, The Netherlands) was used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. two-fold dilutions of heat-inactivated serum from kittens (50 l) were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C with equal aliquots of FIPV DF-2 (50 l of 103.5 TCID50/ml) the viruses were then added to FCWF-4 cells showing 70% confluency in a 96 DF-2 is a regular tissue culture adapted strain that has been well described in the literature. the strain originated as a molecular clone of FIPV DF-2 and then was successfully transfected into cat cells. it was replicated for several generations before being used in this study. kittens were inoculated oronasally with 103 50% tissue culture infective doses (TCID50) of the parent virus FIPV DF-2 (n = 4) and the recombinant viruses PFIPV-DF-2 (n = 4) and PFIPV-FD-2-R3i (n = 4) on a daily basis for 42 days. l of phosphate buffered saline (PBS) was removed after vortexing and 30 min incubation. extract was centrifuged at 1000 x g for 10 min to remove cell debris. the supernatant was used for subsequent PCR. RNA was extracted from the supernatant using the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen), and was subjected to subsequent genomic and subgenomic qRT-PCRs. for antibody ELISA tests, the FCoV EIA Kit, (BV European Veterinary Laboratory, The Netherlands) was used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. cats challenged oronasally with the parent virus FIPV DF-2 (n = 4) and recombinant FCoVs PBFIPV-DF-2 (n = 4) and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i (n = 4) Virus andanimal no. Clinical score Total clinical score Day of death postinfection Fever Depression Anorexia Jaundice Neurological disorder Weight loss Lymphopenia FIPV DF-2 1 2 2 2 3 1 3 2 all cats survived, and showed no macroscopic lesions except for slight enlargement of mesenteric lymph nodes in two animals. the full-length genomic sequence of the virion was determined using next generation sequencing. additional mutations are present in the viral genome. mic ORF7 mRNA levels were detected after inoculating FCWF cells with the wild type and recombinant FCoVs. the genome of PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i contained only the point mutations observed in the infectious clone. shedding decreased to undetectable levels from day 21 p.i. in the infected cats. FCoV RNA was detected from day 3 p.i., reached a first peak of 4.8103 FCoV RNA copies per ml blood by day 7 p.i., then decreased quickly after the emergence of neutralizing antibodies. a second wave of viremia was detected from day 14 p.i. until death peaking at 5.8104 FCoV RNA copies per ml blood. no detectable FCoV RNA copies were found in the examined organs. no other organs contained genomic RNA. the subgenomic qRT-PCR showed replication only in the gut. the PBFIPV-DF-2 challenged cats developed neutralizing antibodies from day 10 p.i. that elevated to lower levels (6.4102) by day 35 p.i. than in the FIPV DF-2 inoculated animals. the difference between VN titers generated after FIPV DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i infected cats showed variable results. recombinant FCoVs PBFIPV-DF-2 (n = 4) and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i (n = 4) cats challenged with a recombinant FCoV containing complemented ORF3abc showed only clinical signs of the acute phase of the disease. in the ORF1ab gene, three nucleotide substitutions were found at positions 3098 (A/G), 5241 (G/A) and 7632 (C/T) causing an amino acid change at position 121 (K/N) in the 7b protein. a single nt change was present at position 27817 (C/G) affecting the last nucleotide of ORF 7 transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) Virus shedding of FIPV DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2 was detected from day 3 p.i. to euthanasia of the PIP diseased animals at very low and variable amounts of an average value close to the detection limit. shedding decreased to undetectable levels from day 21 p.i. in the PBFIPV inoculated animals. FCoV viraemia of cats challenged oronasally with the parent virus FIPV DF-2 (n = 4) and recombinant FCoVs PBFIPV-DF-2 (n = 4) and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i (n = 4) decreased to undetectable level at day 21. no detectable FCoV RNA copies were found in examined organs. the means of groups are given. Error bars represent standard deviations. the PBFIPV-DF-2 challenged animals tested highly positive for FCoV RNA in the ileum. the difference between VN titers generated after FIPV DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i infected cats was statistically significant (p = 0.037) the difference between VN titers generated after FIPV DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i infected cats showed variable results. the difference between VN titers generated after FIPV DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i inf pBFIPV-DF-2 infectious clone was infected with the recombinant FCoV pair. aa substitution was found in papain-like protease 2 responsible for proteolytic processing of nsp1 and nsp2. mutations in PBFIPV-DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2 were shown not to alter virus replication in vitro. no difference was found between replication dynamics of the parent strain and the recombinant virus [17] and ORF7 mRNA transcription was found equal after both FIPV DF-2 and PBFIPV-DF-2 infection. viremia was similar to previous experiments using the genetically closest FIPV strain 79\u20131146 [5]. viremia was different in PBFIPV-DF-2 infected cats. titer of PBFIPV-DF-2 was almost one log lower at peak. the absence of replication in blood monocytes of PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i inoculated cats coincides with previous FECV infection studies. the weak or missing seroconversion of PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i challenged cats is an obvious explanation of the low or absent systemic replication of the virus. recent experiments with recombinant type II FIPV showed that ORF3c containing stop codon can be restored to code full-length 3c protein by point mutation during replication in internal organs and the gut. to investigate the mutability of this region we sequenced the 3c region of PBFIPV-DF-2-R3i from fecal and intestinal samples and found no genetic alterations in this region. observation of numerous natural and experimental FCoV infection in the past decades led to the rise of the idea that completed ORF3abc is indispensable for intestinal replication of the virus. however, this theory has never been confirmed due to the lack of an identical virus pair."}
