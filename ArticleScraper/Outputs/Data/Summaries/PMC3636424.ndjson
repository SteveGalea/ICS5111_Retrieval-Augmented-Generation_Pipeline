{"summary": "more than 8000 people infected in 29 countries across 5 continents. the fatality rate of the outbreak was estimated to be 9.6%. a novel coronavirus, the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was identified as the causative agent. the genome encodes four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocaspid (N). a set of unique accessory proteins (namely ORF 3a, 3b, 6, 7a, 7b, 8a, 8b and 9b) is also found. all the T cell epitopes identified in the SARS-CoV are summarized in Table 1. Summary of T cell epitopes found in the SARS-CoV. ND Human PBMCs 41 Membrane 117 to 140 ND Human PBMCs 41 Membrane 200 to 220 ND Human PBMCs 34 3a 36 to 50 ND Human PBMCs 34 3a 6 to 20 HLA-B*58:01 Human PBMCs Unpublished *ND indicates not determined. first two HLA-A*02:01-restricted T cell epitopes (S1203\u20131211 and S978\u2013986) were 5 healthy individuals without contact history with SARS-CoV also showed SSp-1-specific responses in their PBMCs. other T cell epitopes identified include S787\u2013795, S1042\u20131050 (found in the S2 domain) and S411\u2013420 (found in the S1 domain) some of the epitopes found in either the S1 or S2 domain of the protein should therefore be considered during SARS-CoV vaccine development. some protective effects were conferred through N-specific CD8+ T cells. a group identified 2 potential CTL epitopes at positions N211\u2013235 and N330\u2013354 in the N protein. this response was observed in 19% [3/16] of our cohort of recovered SARS patients. pcDNA-fn vector showed both antibody titre and CTL activity after 3 injections;36 and using Balb/c mice, two other groups showed that DNA vaccines encoding N protein alone could elicit T cell proliferation, IFN release, delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) and in vivo cytotoxic T cell activity. 9% of their subjects had T cell response against the M peptide region, M146\u2013160.34. the 3a protein peptide 3a36\u201350 was one of the three most commonly recognized T cell epitopes identified in their study. the frequency and magnitude of the CD8+ T cell responses were greater than the CD4+ T cell responses. however, the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells were found to have similar central memory phenotypes (CD27+ and CD45RO+) the majority of CD4+ T cells produced IFN, IL-2, and TNF. only a small percentage produced IFN, TNF, MIP 1 or MIP 1 alone or in combination. there is currently no report confirming the protective effect of T cells during a primary SARS-CoV infection in humans. research in this area is hampered by the lack of systematic sample collection during the 2003 SARS outbreak. the protective effect of memory T cell response in recovered SARS patients is not known. HLA-B is known to be the most polymorphic,55 and was associated in protective roles against the HIV,56,57,58 HCV59 and acute influenza infections. the lack of clinical trials also prevented the reaching of a conclusive agreement for effective anti-SARS strategies (reviewed by Weiss et al.61). inefficient immune activation and a poor virus-specific T cell response underlay severe disease in mouse-adapted mice. in humans, SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells were found to persist in the peripheral blood of SARS patients up to 6 years post-infection. this seems to suggest that SARS-CoV-specific T cell response could persist longer and thus indicating that cell-mediated immune response is important for protecting against re-infection."}
