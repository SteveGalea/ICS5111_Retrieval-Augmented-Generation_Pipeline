{"summary": "anovel coronavirus (CoV) emerged in 2002 as the etiologic agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and spread to more than 30 countries in a 6-month period (51) this zoonotic virus is thought to have passed from the Chinese horseshoe bat (23, 26) this zoonotic virus has been shown to replicate in many different species. neutralizing antibodies were detected in patients with more severe disease (32, 33, 52) anti-SARS-CoV in ferrets reduced viral load and fever upon secondary infection. prophylactic administration of monoclonal anti-SARS-CoV antibodies to rodents reduced viral load and fever upon secondary infection. infected monocytes/macrophages have been shown to persist long after virus has been eradicated from the lung. the excessive accumulation of these cells is a prominent pathological feature in most SARS-CoV autopsy cases. in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that SARS-CoV can directly and indirectly impair several of their functions. wild-caught, adult African green monkeys (Chlorocebus aethiops) were obtained from Barbados Primate Research Centre, Barbados, West Indies. all were negative for tuberculosis and vaccinated against measles virus before exposure to SARS-CoV. animals were inoculated with a second dose of SARS-CoV. ryngeal areas were collected longitudinally and at the time of sacrifice. several tissue specimens were collected for virology, immunology, and pathology assessment. titers were determined by applying serial dilutions of homogenized tissue suspensions onto vero E6 cell monolayers. reverse transcription (RT)-PCR with primers NF (AGGATCCATGTCTGATAATGGACCCCAATCAAACC) and NR (AGAATTCTTATGTTGAATCAGCAGAAGCTCC) were cloned into pTarget for in vitro transcription with the MEGAshortscript kit (Applied Biosystems) to set up the standard curve. single-cell suspensions of the lung were prepared from standardized collected lung tissue from the proximal portion of the right caudal lobe. one to two grams of tissue was cut into small pieces followed by an enzymatic digestion with liberase and DNase solution at 37\u00b0C for 90 min. cells were fixed for 16 h in 1% paraformaldehyde and 3% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) cells were fixed for 16 h in 1% paraformaldehyde and 3% FBS in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) IgA horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody (KPL Inc., Gaithersburg, MD) was read at 405 nm using a plate reader. the ELISA antibody titer recorded for each sample was the reciprocal of the highest dilution. the optical density reading for S protein-bound wells was at least 2-fold higher than that of the nonfat milk control. ine was used to generate a heat map to show the fold change in protein levels compared to that of mock-infected controls. the heat map color scheme was chosen, with red indicating 4-fold induction and green representing 4-fold reduction of protein levels. data are expressed as the means standard errors in Table 5. 0.9,250 8.353 8.074 25.21 10.63 4.216 3.336 10.68 1.183* 0.2,800 0.1,300 1.767 0.7,219 1.050 0.9,201 IFN- 31.20 3.901 38.91 14.74 57.00 7.518* 131.5 56.85* 94.52 60.24 44.40 4.596 56.60 37.48 15.07 7.533 62.95 4.750 IL-2 34.35 12.23 1,467 194.3 902.2 165.1 601.9 70.32 1,168 246.9 IL-15 2,691 447.2 2,395 347.6 2,866 265.2 2,502 173.5 3,699 375.2 3,043 434.0 2,749 460.9 1,299 68.46 1,378 214.2 IL-6 212.2 111.3 167.6 83.52 207.4 70.39 102.4 33.09 170.9 68.98 37.75 9.911 22.3 13. values represent picograms/milliliter cytokine SEM. values represent picograms/milliliter cytokine SEM. ND, not done. animals were inoculated with a second dose of SARS-CoV. animals were sacrificed at day 5 or 28 after primary or secondary infection. all data for day 5 after SARS-CoV infection, except for histopathology scoring, were derived exclusively from the challenge-rechallenge studies. ilutions that yielded 2 to 20 plaques were evaluated for number of plaques formed. serum samples were serially diluted prior to incubating with 2,000 PFU/ml SARS-CoV overnight. titers are expressed as the reciprocal of the highest dilution at which the CPE was completely inhibited. coV mRNA were specific for the nucleoprotein (IDT, Coralville, IA) (12), and reactions were carried out using the TaqMan 2 PCR universal master mix. a random assessment of pathology was enabled. sections of the nose (n = 4), trachea (n = 2), left and right lung lobes (n = 6), tracheobronchial lymph node, spleen, mesentery lymph node, kidney, liver, colon cells were washed, counted, and resuspended in 90% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide for cryopreservation. Previously frozen lung leukocytes and lymph nodes were resuscitated and immunophenotyped by flow cytometry. ELISA plates were coated with purified recombinant SARS-CoV S protein in carbonate-coating buffer, 100 ng/well, overnight at 4\u00b0C. serially diluted lung tissue homogenate suspensions, nasal swabs, or serum samples were incubated on S-protein-coated plates overnight at 37\u00b0C. titer recorded for each sample was the reciprocal of the highest dilution. the optical density reading for S protein-bound wells was at least 2-fold higher than that of the nonfat milk control. the OD of the highest titer chosen also had to fall within the linear range. cytokine or chemokine Concn (pg/ml) cytokine SEM Mock infection Primary infection Rechallenge Day 1 Day 3 Day 5 Day 10 Day 14 Day 28 Day 5 Day 28 CXCL13 460.7 148.7 429.1 132.8 897.6 239.0 1,016 555.2 2,057 148.3* 689.3 148.3 79.3 14.22 1,063 377.2 829.5 300.6 CCL3 ND ND 5.250 4.922 IL-8 7,908 2,485 15,907 8,439 4,214 1,689 3,622 1,063 19,994 11,459 8,726 3,588 3,837 2,439 409.5 151.1 303.4 105.0 CCL19 1,919 575.7 2,015 777.7 3,517 1,678 3,478 8,478 859.6 753.7 116.0 2,331 536.9 204.6 54.96 2,449 704.9 1, values represent picograms/milliliter cytokine SEM. values represent picograms/milliliter cytokine SEM. values represent picograms/milliliter cytokine SEM. unpaired, two-tailed nonparametric tests were performed on sample data. values from animals at various infection time points were compared to those from mock-infected controls. kinetics and magnitude of SARS-CoV replication and associated immune responses were evaluated in a natural history of primary infection as well as a homologous rechallenge study. 4 of the 6 animals were SARS-CoV positive in the lung at 10 dpi. only 1 of these had detectable virus in its swab samples. no replicating virus was detected in any lung or swab sample collected at 14 dpi, at 28 dpi, or in 11 of the 12 rechallenged AGMs. anti-SARS-CoV S protein-specific IgG levels were measured in lung tissue. titers continued to rise up to 28 dpi despite absence of productive infection after 10 dpi. IgA titers were boosted in 3 of the 6 rechallenged animals. systemic anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were also monitored in the sera. no significant increase was detected in the SARS-CoV-specific antibody levels. inflammation in the lung observed long after viral clearance and following rechallenge. at 5 dpi, interstitial pneumonia was present in 17% of the monkeys. other lung lesions of perivascular infiltrations and alveolitis were present but less severe. veolitis, and interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis and alveolitis were present, with an incidence and severity similar to those of primary challenge but with a more chronic inflammatory response. twenty-eight days after rechallenge, interstitial pneumonia with fibrosis and alveolitis were slightly increased in severity but not incidence

activation of lung macrophages but not dendritic cells in SARS-CoV infection. mice infected with the lethal MA15 show inefficient immune activation. expression of CD209/DC-SIGN was also evaluated on lung macrophages. levels of CD209 were higher on macrophages than mDCs prior to and at most time points postinfection. 209/DC-SIGN (D) of total Ms or DCs are plotted. asterisks indicate that values are significantly different from those of mock-infected controls. the dynamics of lymphocyte expansion and activation were evaluated in the lung-draining lymph nodes. the relative frequency of lymph node T cells (CD3+) and mDCs (CD14CD11c+) for mock (open bars) and SARS-CoV (closed bars)-infected animals was determined by flow cytometry. kinetics and magnitude of SARS-CoV replication and associated immune responses were evaluated in a natural history of primary infection as well as homologous rechallenge study. titers peaked at 5 dpi in the swabs and at 1 dpi in the lung. by 10 dpi, SARS-CoV replication in the lung had decreased. 4 of the 6 animals were positive in the lung at 10 dpi. however, only 1 of these had detectable virus in its swab samples. anti-SARS-CoV S protein-specific IgG was measured in lung tissue by ELISA. the asterisk indicates that the mean titers are significantly different. data are shown for animals that were followed until day 28 after rechallenge only. anti-SARS-CoV IgA antibodies were monitored longitudinally in mucosal secretions of rechallenge animals. not all had detectable anti-SARS-CoV IgA in nasal swabs. systemic anti-SARS-CoV antibodies were also monitored in the sera following primary and secondary infection. protein-specific IgG measured in serum by ELISA Sample Dilutiona Day 0 Primary infection Rechallenge

cytokines returned to mock-infected control levels by 28 dpi. ines and chemokines were measured in lung tissue homogenates across the primary infection time course (1, 3, 5, 10, 14, 28 dpi) the fold-induction of average protein levels over those of mock-infected controls is represented in a heat map. black representing no change, red indicating a 4-fold induction, and green indicating a 4-fold reduction in the average cytokine levels (n = 6 animals for each time point) the frequency of mDCs with high HLA-DR surface marker infection was lower than that of mock-infected controls. the expression of CD209/DC-SIGN, which is one of the cellular receptors for SARS-CoV (28, 56) was also evaluated on lung macrophages and mDCs during primary and secondary infection. total Ms or DCs are indicated in each plot. asterisks indicate that values are significantly different from those of mock-infected controls. the dynamics of lymphocyte expansion and activation were evaluated in the lung-draining lymph nodes. the number of lymph node cells was determined per gram of tracheobronchial lymph node tissue. mDCs and lymph node T cells were further characterized for expression of activation markers. animal models that mimic the human disease are critical for elucidating the immune mechanisms that provide protection. s were highly permissive for SARS-CoV infection, with replicating virus detected throughout the respiratory tract up to 10 dpi. the transient nature of the infection in the airways is intriguing and consistent with reported clinical cases in which SARS-CoV can be isolated from upper airways. many proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were upregulated in the lung between days 1 and 14 pi. this response does not appear to be indicative of a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d that has been reported in other coronavirus infections. lymphopenia in patients was a common hematological feature in acute SARS-CoV infection. there was a significant reduction in the proportion of T lymphocytes of total lung leukocytes at 14 dpi. cause of the lung T cell decline in our studies is unclear. despite low levels of antibodies capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV in several AGMs at 1 dpi, the anti-SARS-CoV antibody titers were significantly higher (at least 4-fold) by 28 dpi. despite the lack of immune boost in the periphery following rechallenge, lung antibody levels were significantly elevated and a dramatic expansion of lymphocytes was observed with reinfection."}
