{"summary": "chitosan, squalene and others are approved as supplementary health foods. the term \"health food supplements\" used until 2002 is now converted to \"health functional foods\" the scale of Korea's health functional food market was estimated to be worth 3.9 trillion won in 2011. red ginseng is made from 6-year-old fresh ginseng that is steamed at 100\u00b0C. through this process, ginseng starch begins to gelatinize, increasing the amount of saponin content. red ginseng is more widely used as herbal medicine compared to white ginseng. yin et al.7 administered mice with saponin, polysaccharide, total RGE and antiviral medication orally to identify which components of red ginseng have anti influenza effect. yin et al.7 demonstrated that red ginseng supplements has the potential to improve postprandial plasma glucose level. some reports have proposed that red ginseng can improve erectile dysfunction in men. multivitamin and mineral supplements were given to nutrition-deficient individuals in Linxial area based on the fact that their incidence rates of esophageal and gastric cardia cancers were high. the study was performed to examine whether esophageal, gastric and other cancers were reduced in patients with esophageal dysplasia that appeared to be a precancerous lesion. omega-3 fatty acids have the first double bond three carbons from the methyl terminal. omega-6 fatty acids have their first double bond six carbons from the methyl terminal. fatty acids may reduce risk for cardiovascular disease are thought to be attributable to lowered serum triglyceride levels and antithrombotic, anti-inflammatory and antihypertensive activities. daily intake of 0.5 to 1.8 g of EPA/DHA decreases mortality rate caused by cardiovascular disease. fatty acids can be achieved by eating fatty fish at least twice a week. reduced by 19% in the group consumed 1.8 g of EPA with statins daily for 5 years compared to that of the group with statins alone. omega-3 supplements did not reduce overall mortality rate, mortality rate caused by cardiovascular disease, and the risk of myocardial infarction or stroke. consistent consumption of fatty fish is recommended to prevent cardiovascular disease in postmenopausal women almost not eating oily fish and not taking statins. glucosamine sulfate has shown effective clinical results to date. but many clinical studies have reported ineffectiveness of glucosamine sold in other forms. the effect of glucosamine in the treatment of osteoarthritis remains controversial. glucosamine is effective in osteoarthritis, so it can be taken into account in patients who are unable to take other osteoarthritis medicines after detailed consultation. glucosamine made from crustacean shells is strictly forbidden in people with shellfish allergy or asthma."}
