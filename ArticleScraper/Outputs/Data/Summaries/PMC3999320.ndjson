{"summary": "SD BIOLINE Rota/Adeno Rapid kit tested 400 clinical stool samples. results were obtained using ELISA, enzyme-linked fluorescent assays (ELFA), PCR, and multiplex reverse transcription-PCR. overall agreement rates among the tested methods were 91.5% for rotavirus and 85.5% for adenovirus. rotaviruses are the primary cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children during winter months. group A rotaviruses are the principal cause of human infections. adenoviruses are grouped into 6 species (A to F) with more than 50 serotypes that infect a multitude of tissues. the SD Rota/Adeno Rapid test was performed immediately on the fresh stool samples. each stool sample was diluted to a 10% stool suspension in phosphate-buffered saline. results were read after 15 min. ELISA for rotavirus and adenovirus detection was conducted by using the RIDASCREEN Rotavirus and RIDASCREEN Adenovirus tests. these tests use monoclonal antibodies against rotavirus VP6 and adenovirus hexon surface antigens. the assays were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. based assay was conducted by using a commercial qualitative real-time PCR kit with Simplexa Adenovirus 3' Hexon and Adenovirus 5' Hexon primer pairs (Simplexa Adenovirus, Focus Diagnostics, Cypress, CA, USA) nucleic acid templates and detection of 6-carboxyfluorescein-labeled products were performed on 3M integrated cycler system (Focus Diagnostics) 4 (KBPV-VR-60), AdV 8 (KBPV-VR-3), AdV 23 (KBPV-VR-5), enterovirus type 71 (ATCC VR-784), cytomegalovirus (ATCC VR-538), poliovirus type 1 (ATCC VR-58), coxsackievirus A type 9 (ATCC VR-186), coxsackievirus B type 5 (ATCC VR-1036), BK virus (ATCC VR-837), respiratory cloacae (KCCM 12178), Vibrio parahaemolyticus (KCCM 11965), Salmonella group B (clinical isolate from patient), Salmonella group E (clinical isolate from patient), Shigella group D (clinical isolate from patient), Yersinia enterocolitica (clinical isolate from patient), Vibrio vulnificus (clinical isolate from patient), Salmonella typhi (clinical isolate from patient), and Clostridium difficile each substance (5 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of solvent (hemoglobin in distilled water; triglyceride in ether; bilirubin in chloroform; all others in distilled water) the final concentrations of barium sulfate, loperamide, metronidazole, hemoglobin, bilirubin, and triglyceride mix were 0.25 mg/mL each. the agreement between the ICA and other tests for the detection of rotavirus and adenovirus using clinical stool samples were assessed by positive agreement rate, negative agreement rate, total agreement rate, and kappa coefficient (0.001-0.2 indicates slight concurrence, 0.201-0.4 indicates fair agreement, 0.401-0.6 shows moderate agreement, 0.401-0.6 shows moderate agreement, and 0.801-0.999 shows excellent agreement). ELISA for rotavirus and adenovirus detection was conducted by using the RIDASCREEN Rotavirus and RIDASCREEN Adenovirus tests. the tests use monoclonal antibodies against rotavirus VP6 and adenovirus hexon surface antigens. the assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. ic acid was amplified using a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) the PCR products were visualized after electrophoresis on an agarose gel. all procedures were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. the commercially available Seeplex DV mRT-PCR assay was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions. mRT-PCR was used to simultaneously detect group A rotaviruses, AdV 40 and 41 (species F), noroviruses GI and GII, and astroviruses. the nucleic acid was amplified using a thermal cycler (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) cross-reactivity for viruses, bacteria, and fungi was examined. for viruses, bacteria, and fungi, colonies were diluted with saline. for bacteria and fungi, colonies were diluted with saline. s simplex virus type 1(ATCC-VR-733), respiratory syncytial virus (ATCC VR-26), parainfluenza virus type 2 (ATCC VR-92), rhinovirus type 14 (ATCC VR-284), echovirus type 7 (ATCC VR-37), coronavirus (ATCC VR-740, -759), and mumps virus (ATCC VR-106) Bacteria: Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 29213), ICA, ELISA, real-time PCR, and mRT-PCR for adenovirus subtypes were assessed using culture supernatant of following adenoviruses. each substance (5 mg) was dissolved in 1 mL of solvent (hemoglobin in distilled water; triglyceride in ether; bilirubin in chloroform; all others in distilled water) 50 L of solution was mixed with 950 L of negative stool suspension. final concentrations of barium sulfate, loperamide, metronidazole, hemoglobin, bilirubin, and triglyceride mix were 0.25 mg/mL each. repeatability/reproducibility and limit of detection Group A rotaviruses were inoculated and cultured in MA104 cells. the positive rates of ICA, ELISA, ELFA, and mRT-PCR for rotavirus were 20.3%, 16.0%, 13.8%, and 16.0% respectively. the positive agreement, negative agreement, and overall agreement rate of ICA compared with mRT-PCR were 100%, 94.9%, and 95.8% (=0.857), respectively. the positive rates of ICA, ELISA, real-time PCR, and mRT-PCR for adenovirus were 7.5%, 6.3%, 10.3%, and 3.5%, respectively. cross-reactivity and analytical reactivity No cross-reactivity was observed for any of the 36 viruses, 30 bacteria, and 2 fungi that were tested. ELISA, ELISA, ELFA, real-time PCR, and mRT-PCR for the detection of rotavirus and adenovirus are shown in Tables. inter-lot variability for the detection limit was less than that of a one-fold dilution. positive rates of ICA, ELISA, ELFA, and mRT-PCR for rotavirus were 20.3%, 16.0%, 13.8%, and 16.0% respectively. the positive agreement, negative agreement, and overall agreement rate of ICA compared with mRT-PCR were 100%, 94.9%, and 95.8% (=0.857), respectively. overall agreement among the 4 methods was 91.5% for rotaviruses. positive agreement, negative agreement, and overall agreement rate of ICA compared with real-time PCR were 36.6%, 95.8%, and 89.8% (=0.368), respectively. cross-reactivity and analytical reactivity No cross-reactivity was observed for any of the 36 viruses, 30 bacteria, and 2 fungi that were tested. repeatability/reproducibility for rotaviruses and adenoviruses was 100% in culture supernatant diluted to 1:8 (rotavirus), 1:32 (AdV 40), and 1:64 (AdV 41), and negative samples. ICA performed for the detection of rotaviruses and adenovirus abbreviations: ICA, immunochromatographic assay; RV, rotavirus; AdV, adenovirus the overall agreement rates among the 4 methods were 91.5% for rotaviruses. the discordant rate between the ICA and mRT-PCR was similar to that reported in previous studies. however, 17 stool samples showed positive results by using the ICA, but tested negative by using ELISA, ELFA, and mRT-PCR. twenty-eight samples were found to be positive for adenovirus when tested by using the Simplexa real-time PCR assay. but were found to be negative when tested by using the Seegene mRT-PCR. the discordant results could be explained by the differences in the ability of each assay to detect variable adenovirus burdens. ICA kit could be useful in clinical practice for rapid detection of rotavirus and adenovirus infection. however, the possibility of false-positive findings and different detectability for adenovirus subtypes should be considered."}
