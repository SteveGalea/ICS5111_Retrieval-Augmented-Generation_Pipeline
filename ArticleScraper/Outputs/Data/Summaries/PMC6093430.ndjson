{"summary": "on the microbial side, the view was that microbes were disease perpetrators with virulence factors that acted upon the host to cause disease. on the host side, immune impairment was viewed as rendering the host vulnerable to microbes that only cause disease in the setting of immune defects. microbial pathogenesis is 1 outcome of an interaction between a host and a microbe; host-relevant outcome of host\u2013microbe interaction is host damage; host damage can stem from microbial factors, host factors, or both. these tenets made it possible to account for the host and the microbe in the pathogenesis of infectious diseases. the outcomes of infection represented by the states of commensalism, colonization, latency, and disease are depicted as a function of damage on the Y-axis. the states of commensalism, colonization, and latency can transition to the state of disease due to host or microbial factors. cytokine storm plays a central role in the pathogenesis of influenza, dengue, Ebola, and malaria [10\u201314] and in inflammation-enhanced mortality of young people with pandemic influenza [15], 17. the right-hand side of the parabola may also explain reduced efficacy and greater risk of severe dengue in younger dengue-naive vaccine recipients [16, 17] the DRF has the potential to provide clinicians tools to determine whether a patient needs therapy to enhance or reduce their inflammatory response. this will require scientific advances, such as more robust and complex measures of damage, and more robust and complex measures of microbial states. this will make it possible to develop and select therapies that will move the patient to an appropriate damage-reducing point on the parabola. anti-inflammatory agents, including statins, may dampen the inflammatory response in treatment of influenza, pneumonia, and Ebola. however, statins may dampen the response to influenza vaccine [38, 39] and have other untoward effects. however, statins may dampen the response to influenza vaccine. antibodies to bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi that alter microbial transcription, metabolism, or growth have been described [48\u201351] and may hold promise as therapeutic agents. antibodies to bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi that alter microbial transcription, metabolism, or growth have been described. the DRF applies to both individuals and populations [2] and thus can provide insight into host\u2013microbe interaction at the patient and epidemiological level. physicians-scientists are perfectly poised to lead the way forward with approaches that will make DRF-based management of infectious diseases a reality."}
