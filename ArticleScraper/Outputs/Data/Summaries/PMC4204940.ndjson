{"summary": "TGEV is an animal coronavirus that causes severe gastroenteritis in young pigs. mortality rate for piglets under 2 weeks of age is the highest, reaching almost 100%. pigs often present with vomiting, dehydration, and severe diarrhea. transmembrane protein acts as a minor structural component in TGEV. it is infectious and invades the organism through the digestive and respiratory tracts. these changes are known to be important during the pathogenesis of TGEV infection. a recent study indicates that plasmid-transcribed small hairpin (sh) RNAs targeting the ORF7 gene of TGEV is capable of inhibiting virus replication and expression of the viral target gene in ST cells in vitro [15]. a recent study indicates that plasmid-transcribed small hairpin (sh) RNAs targeting the ORF7 gene of TGEV is capable of inhibiting virus replication and expression of the viral target gene in ST cells in vitro. isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantitation (iTRAQ) technique is a more advanced method for proteomic research. it is capable of detecting a much larger number of proteins, even those with low abundance. to this end, Lu et al. previously used the iTRAQ method to identify 160 significantly altered proteins in pulmonary alveolar macrophages infected with PRRSV. TGEV infection The monolayer of confluent ST cells was dispersed with 0.25% trypsin and 0.02% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) the cells were then infected with the TGEV TH-98 strain at a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID50) of 1103.53 viruses per well, with absorption for 2 h at 37\u00b0C. RT reaction was incubated at 37\u00b0C for 15 min followed by 85\u00b0C for 5 s. a mixture of oligo dT primers and random 6 mers was used in the RT step. cDNA was stored at 20\u00b0C until further use. the cycling conditions were 94\u00b0C for 4 min followed by 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C for 20 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 30 s, and then a final extension of 10 min at 72\u00b0C. the relative gene expression was determined with the 2(Ct) method [28] and the tests were performed in triplicate. 2D LC-MS/MS analysis The combined peptide mixtures were separated by reversed phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on a Durashell-C18 reverse phase column (4.6 mm 250 mm, 5 m 100, Agela) the mobile phases used were composed of 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) in water (labeled mobile phase A) and 20 mM ammonium formate (pH 10) in acetonit data analysis and bioinformatics Protein identification and quantification were performed with the ProteinPilot software (version 4.0, AB Sciex) each MS/MS spectrum was searched against a database of Sus scrofa protein sequences (NCBI nr, released in March 2011) the protein-protein interaction network for a select group of proteins was analyzed using the STRING 9.1 database. the protein-protein interaction network for a select group of proteins was analyzed using the STRING 9.1 database. anti-caspase 8 antibody (1300; abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (15000; Western Biotechnology, China) for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C. membranes were then washed four times in TBST buffer for 5 min each time. a mock group of ST cells that were not infected with TGEV was added to the cells. three replicates of virus-infected and mock-infected cultures were prepared. the morphological changes were observed at 24, 40, 48, and 64 hours post infection. RT-PCR products were resolved on a 15 g/L agarose gel. a final extension step was carried out at 72 C for 10 min. a final extension step was carried out at 72 C for 10 min. the soluble protein fraction was harvested by centrifugation at 40,000 g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. a 100 g aliquot of protein from each sample was reduced, alkylated, and trypsin-digested. two virus-free samples at 48 h and 64 h were labeled with iTRAQ tags 114 and 115. the elutant was collected into 48 centrifuge tubes at each minute after the first 5 min. each aliquot was then dried by vacuum freezing. the peptides were then analyzed with a nanoflow reversed-phase liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (nano-RPLC-MS/MS) system. iTRAQ 4-plex (peptide labeled), cysteine alkylation with methyl methanethiosulfonate(MMTS), trypsin digestion, biological modifications allowed. a thorough search, a detected protein threshold of 95% confidence (unused Protscore 1.3) and a critical false discovery rate (FDR) of 1% were used. membranes were incubated with anti-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) mouse monoclonal antibody (13000; Western Biotechnology, China), anti-heat shock protein 90 alpha (Hsp90/HSP90AA1) antibody (1300; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) overnight at 4\u00b0C, followed by HRP-conjugate secondary antibody (15000; Western Biotechnology, China) for 1.5 h at 37\u00b0C. cytopathic effects (CPEs) were imaged at 24 (A), 40 (B), 48 (C) and 64 (D) hours after infection. qRT-PCR analysis of changes in mRNA expression levels in ST cells. the average Ct value for the -actin control gene ranged from 19.6 to 27.5. the relative expression of TGEV N mRNA was calculated using the 2(\u2013CT) method [28], and the change in expression at each time point is indicated in Figure 2B. differentially expressed proteins identified were considered to show a significant upward or downward trend if their expression ratios were greater than 4.0 or less than 0.25 compared to the control group. iTRAQ ratios higher than 3.3475 (p = 0.975) or lower than 1.3475 (p = 0.025) were defined as statistically significant. gi|359811347 60 kDa heat shock protein, mitochondrial \u2013 139.52 3.16 0.00 5.86 0.00 gi|227430407 Keratin, type II cytoskeletal 8 KRT8 110.35 4.02 0.00 6.49 0.00 gi|347300243 Glutamate dehydrogenase 1, mitochondrial GLUD1 102.28 1.79 0.18 4.17 0.00 gi|297591975 ATP synth 3.28 0.00 6.98 0.00 gi|148230268 Galectin-3 LGALS3 48.39 3.08 0.15 5.06 0.01 gi|8745552 Voltage-dependent anion channel 1 VDAC1 43.46 6.19 0.01 11.59 0.00 gi|330417958 Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase [GTP], mitochondrial PCK2 42.89 1.96 0.09 5.75 0.00 gi|35 gi|297747350 FAT tumor suppressor homolog 1 \u2013 32.04 6.08 0.00 7.24 0.00 gi|298104076 Enoyl-CoA hydratase, mitochondrial \u2013 30.50 2.21 0.23 6.55 0.00 gi|7939586 Dihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase DLST 30.42 1.71 0.17 4.06 0.00 gi|7404364 Hydroxy mitochondrial precursor OXCT1 23.94 1.72 0.22 6.37 0.00 gi|346986361 Electron-transfer-flavoprotein, alpha polypeptide ETFA 22.41 2.42 0.34 5.55 0.00 gi|172072653 Lactadherin precursor MFGE8 22.33 10.19 0.00 9.64 0.00 gi|56417363 Cathepsin D protein \u2013 21.95 0.54 0.0 2.38* gi|150251019 Adenylate kinase 3-like 1 AK3L1 15.85 2.05 0.12 4.06 0.00 gi|158517860 Thymosin beta-10 TMSB10 13.45 6.25 0.30 7.52 0.30 gi|47522698 Cathepsin L1 precursor CTSL 12.72 4.45 0.01 5.11 0.01 gi|329744622 Low-density lipoprotein receptor precursor LDLR gi|4579751 130 kDa regulatory subunit of myosin phosphatase, partial \u2013 9.64 8.39 0.00 3.94 0.27 gi|76781337 ADAMTS1 ADAMTS1 9.61 6.79 0.00 7.38 0.00 gi|417515625 Interferon-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 2 \u2013 9.52 1.53 0.68 10.76* 0.00 gi|4752 kinase PKR 6.07 5.65 0.19 6.67 0.15 gi|339895859 Lipase, endothelial precursor LIPG 5.14 4.06 0.04 3.25 0.05 gi|6226834 2'-5'-oligoadenylate synthase 1 OAS1 5.03 1.96 0.09 10.47* 0.01 gi|21636588 ATP synthase gamma subunit 1 \u2013 4.61 2.

HSP90 is one of the most abundant molecular chaperones that is induced in response to cellular stress. it functions to stabilize proteins involved in cell growth and anti-apoptotic signaling. reduction of HSP90 has been reported to decrease correct assembly of human enterovirus 71 viral particles. a recent study showed that HSP70 is an essential host factor for the replication of PRRSV. a recent study showed that the silence of HSP70 significantly reduced PRRSV replication. we speculate that these proteins play a potential role in TGEV replication. the upregulation of the TGF- may impair the host immune response during PRRSV infection by limiting the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines necessary to decrease PRRSV replication. interferon-inducible antiviral proteins, RSAD2, OAS1, were also upregulated in the period of late infection.
