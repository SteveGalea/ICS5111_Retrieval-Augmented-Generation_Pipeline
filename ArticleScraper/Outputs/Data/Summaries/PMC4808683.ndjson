{"summary": "in this paper, the author reviews the environment surrounding health strategies and plans. the quest for a new paradigm of disease-control efforts and challenges and opportunities for Japan are discussed. the article is based on a keynote speech presented at the 2015 Global Health Workshop of the Association of Pacific Rim Universities. the Sustainable Development Summit adopted SDGs in September 2015. these became effective from January 1, 2016 and cover the period from 2016 to 2030. health sectors are nervous about this transformation from MDGs to SDGs. by 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age. all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least 12 per 1000 live births and under-5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1000 live births. by 2030, reduce by one third premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention and treatment. the goals are categorized into five groups, the so-called 5Ps: People, Planet, Partnership, Peace, and Prosperity, which need to be promoted by all countries to create a sustainable world. a typical example is onchocerciasis, an indigenous parasitic disease which occurs at riversides, particularly in West Africa. the global fund to fight AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria (Global Fund) shaped today\u2019s global health landscape. one is strengthening of health security, triggered by the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) experience in Asia in 2003. the annual budgets of the BMGF and M\u00e9decins sans frontiers are almost equal to the budget of WHO. the results appear in a special article of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, which lists the 10 greatest public health achievements worldwide from 2001 to 2010. AIDS-related mortality is down by 30% from its peak in 2005. despite the fact that NCD represent the greatest challenge to global health, WHO has adopted few strategies and plans. the adoption of this strategy carries much weight because it means that the health ministers of all 194 member countries agree with it. in 2016, a new strategy will be developed for HIV/AIDS. the global health circle needs to consult with the member states, bring in scientific communities, and listen to civil societies. informally, WHO has conversations with donors to determine whether they will financially support the proposed new strategy. 0.8 billion people live in low-income countries, where communicable diseases remain the major killers. 0.8 billion people live in low-income countries, where communicable diseases remain the major killers. shifted to non-communicable diseases and are closely similar to those in high-income countries. hepatitis is a cause of cancer, followed by ischemic heart disease. a second challenge is the development of a new global strategy for hepatitis. setting targets is difficult because the majority of heavily affected countries are middle-income countries. this is why the circle is not yet complete, and may account for the empty cells in Table 3. an independent review panel of WHO7 has identified the above issues. a high-level UN panel report and an institute of medicine report are coming soon. the major foci will be full implementation of IHR to detect signals of international health concerns. aging is a global phenomenon, and not exclusive to Asia, Europe, and North America. in the 1950s, the Japanese focus was on tuberculosis control. in 1952, 25% of national medical expenditure was allocated to tuberculosis. in 1952, 50% of national hospital beds were occupied by TB patients. UNITAID is introducing innovative financing13 to reduce prices of commodities by collecting an international solidarity levy. Japan has the unique opportunity in 2016 to host the G7 summit and the Tokyo International Conference on African development."}
