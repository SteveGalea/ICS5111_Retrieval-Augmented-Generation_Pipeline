{"summary": "IBV is endemic in probably all countries that raise chickens. only a few amino acid differences in the S1 protein of vaccine and challenge strains of IBV may result in poor protection. IBV is a virus member of genus Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. the virus encodes phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), spike glycoprotein (S) and small membrane protein (E) the spike glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved into two subunits. allantoic fluid of the 4th passage of Egypt/F/03 was harvested at 48 h PI. all of them showed typical lesions of the IBV (stunting and dwarfing) the virus identity was ascertained by performing Dot-ELISA on the CAM homogenate. 73 97 98 98 99 76 95 75 68 72 77 74 76 98 78 1 Egypt/F/03 2 71 73 74 74 75 74 73 76 76 77 75 98 78 2 Egypt/Beni-Suef/01 3 74 73 77 73 74 72 71 99 97 82 70 76 76 78 84 3 Egypt/D/89 4 97 97 76 94 76 13 UK/4/91 14 68 97 73 68 68 69 66 67 73 73 69 71 73 74 79 14 Israel/720/99 15 71 68 72 69 68 70 71 69 67 73 73 71 88 69 76 15 IS/188/96/Var.1 16 97 71 73 96 93 96 97 70 84 73 73 72 72 70 71 78 chickens inoculated with Egypt/F/03 exhibited snicking and rales in 50% of infected birds at 3rd day of inoculation. conjunctivitis was observed in 20/30 at 3rd day PI of infected birds. post-mortem examination revealed petechial haemorrhages in larynx and thymus, severe congestion of liver, spleen and lungs. chickens 5 d P.I with Egypt/F/03 showed diffuse lymphocytic aggregation, degeneration of the epithelium mucus, and haemorrhages (20 ). chickens vaccinated with H120 showed 58.3% protection (7/12) by virus reisolation procedure and 66.6% protection by histopathology after challenge with EgyptF/03. birds of group B (vaccinated and challenged with IBV) showed multifocal ted unchallenged group did not show any abnormalities (0/12) either in tracheae or kidneys. none of control unchallenged groups possessed kidney immunofluorescence. tracheal histopathological scores were considered positive (unprotected) negative (protected) tracheal scores range was 1\u20132. negative (protected) tracheal scores range was 1\u20132. all potential glycosylation sites found in Egypt/F/03 were shared with those found in H120 and M41. all potential glycosylation sites were shared with those found in H120 and M41. 73 72 73 74 76 74 94 83 67 76 76 78 84 11 D3896 12 72 73 81 72 71 72 72 77 70 82 83 70 76 76 79 81 12 Vic.S 13 72 72 72 72 71 72 71 72 71 72 71 72 71 71 71 71 69 73 73 72 75 93 77 76 13 UK/4/91 14 68 97 73 68 chickens inoculated with Egypt/F/03 showed snicking and rales in 50% of infected birds at 3rd day PI. post-mortem examination of dead birds revealed petechial haemorrhages in larynx and thymus. tracheal and renal histopathological lesions were more severe in dead birds than birds sacrificed at 5 days PI. tracheal and renal histopathological lesions were more severe in dead birds than birds sacrificed at 5 days PI. chickens 5 d P.I with Egypt/F/03 showed hyperplasia, lymphcytic infiltration and oedema (20 ). birds in group C (vaccinated unchallenged group) did not show any abnormalities (0/12) either in tracheae or kidneys. none of control unchallenged groups possessed kidney immunofluorescence. none of control unchallenged groups possessed kidney immunofluorescence. unprotected tracheal samples showed positive IBV reisolation. protected tracheal samples showed negative results. ETracheal histopathology 4 days post challenge with Egypt/F/03 was measured as tracheal histopathological scores. nephritis on days 5 and 7 post infection indicated that EgyptF03 is a nephrogenic IBV. microscopic findings of the renal tubules matched the general findings recorded with nephrogenic IBV strains. sion and virus re-isolation were used as parameters for tracheal protection. re-isolation of Egypt/F/03 from the trachea of vaccinated birds reflects lack of complete protection afforded by vaccination. IBV serotypes commonly differ by 20 to 25% in S1 [11,36] but some serotypes differ in S1 by as little as 2% [13], suggesting that only a few epitopes may induce most of the VN antibody. chickens Sixty nine commercial 1-day-old chickens were reared under strict hygienic conditions in separate rooms. Rabbit anti-IBV Rabbit anti-IBV polyclonal antiserum raised against vero adapted H120 vaccine was prepared previously in our lab. the supernatant fluid was inoculated into chorioallantoic sac of 10-day-old SPF ECE. five eggs of the 4th egg passage were incubated till being 18-day-old. RNA was harvested from the aqueous layer and extracted using a Qiagen Viral RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen, Inc., Valencia, CA) the RNA was eluted in sterile diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEPC)-treated water. RT was performed on the viral RNA using the GeneAmp RNA PCR Core Kit. PCR product was cut from 1.8% agarose gels, purified with the Qiagen gel extraction kit (Qiagen, Inc.) purified RT-PCR product was sequenced in the forward and reverse directions using the same primers. BLAST\u00ae analysis was initially performed using the S1 sequence of Egypt/F/03 (DQ487085) to establish its identity to GenBank accessions. clinical signs and gross post-mortem lesions as well as mortalities were recorded. tracheae and kidneys were kept as control uninfected group. the scores for each bird were added and the mean score for each bird was calculated. the presence of viral antigens in kidneys was screened by immunofluorescent antibody technique. Rabbit anti-IBV Rabbit anti-IBV polyclonal antiserum raised against vero adapted H120 vaccine was prepared previously in our lab [17] and used for detection of IBV antigens in both dot-ELISA and indirect immunofluorescent antibody technique. dot-ELISA for virus identification A Dot-ELISA was performed according to [39] three l of CAM homogenate of the 4th virus passage of Egypt/F/03, positive control (CAM homogenate 48 h after inoculation of H120 vaccine) and negative control samples were applied as small spots on the membrane. the membrane was allowed to air dry for 15 min then blocked for 30 min. ive allantoic fluids with an equal volume of molecular biology grade phenol (pH 4.3) were vortexed and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 3 min. the supernatant was harvested and an additional treatment using phenol/chloroform/isoamyl alcohol (pH 4.3) was performed. a comparative analysis of S1 sequences was performed using the CLUSTAL W Multiple Sequence Alignment Program. the tree was constructed using the neighbour-joining program [41]. commercial 1-day-old chickens were used to evaluate the protection provided by H120 vaccination against challenge with Egypt/F/03. single dose of vaccine was used for each bird in groups A and C according to manufacturer's instructions. chickens in group A and B were challenged by eye drop with Egypt/F/03. the presence of viral antigens in kidneys was screened by immunofluorescent antibody technique. deparaffinized slides were incubated with rabbit anti-IBV antibodies (1:5) for 1 h. slides were rinsed three times (10min./single wash) with PBS. provided sample for isolation, helped in performing virulence test and protection study and reviewed the manuscript. JGJr helped in performing RT-PCR, S1 gene sequence of Egypt/F/03 and critically reviewed the manuscript."}
