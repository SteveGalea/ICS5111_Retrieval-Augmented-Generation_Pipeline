{"summary": "the registrar of births and deaths registers all births and deaths within the city limits under the Registration of Births and Deaths Act. deaths that occur in a hospital are reported by hospital authorities, who provide a medical certificate of death that is sent to the RBD officer in the city ward in which their home is located. excess deaths for each month in 2006 were the difference between actual observed number of deaths and expected number of deaths. average monthly mortality rates for 2002\u20132005 were then compared with the mortality rate for 2006 (epidemic year). registrar of births and deaths registers all births and deaths within the city limits under the Registration of births and deaths Act. the expected number of monthly deaths for each month in 2006 was calculated by multiplying the average mortality rate for each month by the monthly population in 2006. excess deaths for each month in 2006 were the difference between actual observed number of deaths and expected number of deaths. average monthly mortality rates for 2002\u20132005 were then compared with the mortality rate for 2006. excess number of deaths peaked in September 2006, when 1,448 additional deaths (47.38% of total additional deaths for 2006) occurred when compared with the expected deaths for the same months for the previous 4 years. chikungunya cases, deaths, and mortality rates, Ahmedabad, India, 2002\u20132005 and 2006*. 460\u20132,622) 3,989 1,448 10.05 +56.96 Oct 3,555 5.92 (5.64\u20136.03) 2,355 (2,277\u20132,433) 3,121 766 7.85 +32.51 Nov 539 6.27 (5.97\u20136.38) 2,500 (2,420\u20132,580) 2,698 198 6.77 +7.90 Dec 300 6.54 (6.22\u20136.63) 2,613 (2,531\u20132,695) 2,537 76 6.35 2.90 Total the chikungunya epidemic is the most plausible explanation for the large increase in deaths in Ahmedabad in august\u2013November 2006. the cause of death is poorly reported, and the RBD does not separate death data for residents and nonresidents. 260 excess deaths were reported on R\u00e9union Island during the epidemic. excess number of deaths observed during the epidemic in Ahmedabad suggests that estimates of deaths caused by chikungunya in India need to be revised. the government of india has declared repeatedly in the parliament that there are no deaths directly attributable to Chikungunya in India (6). the increase in deaths in Ahmedabad was largely attributable to the chikungunya epidemic. an unexplained cause of death cannot be ruled out."}
