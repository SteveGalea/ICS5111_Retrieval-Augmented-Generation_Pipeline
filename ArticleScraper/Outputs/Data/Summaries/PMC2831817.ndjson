{"summary": "rFGF21 forms inclusion bodies in the bacteria making it difficult to purify and obtain high concentrations of bioactive rFGF21. to overcome this problem, we fused the FGF21 with SUMO (Small ubiquitin-related modifier) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and expressed the fused gene in E. coli BL21(DE3). FGF21 stimulates lipolysis in adipocytes, a process which releases fatty acids into the bloodstream. when they reach the liver, these fatty acids are converted to ketones. systemic administration of FGF21 reduced plasma glucose, fructosamine, triglycerides, insulin, and glucagon. SUMO is then post-translationally enzymatically cleaved from the desired protein by SUMO C-terminal hydrolases-isopeptidases. proteins such as, SARS virus protein[15], MMP13[16], EGF[17], metallothionein[18], and KGF2[19] have been successfully expressed and purified using this fusion strategy. recombinant plasmid was confirmed by automated DNA sequencing. the sequence of the SUMO-FGF21 (864 bp, SUMO 318 bp, human FGF21 546 bp) is in conformity with the prior sequence. tacagggccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc the fusion fragment was synthesized by primer extension and PCR. the molecular weight of the PCR fragment is shown in Lane 1, 2 and 3. expression and purification of SUMO-FGF21 Recombinants were inoculated. Bacterial containing pET-SUMO-FGF21 were induced by IPTG for 3 h or 4 h at 37\u00b0C in Figure 3A. the results from the different treatments are shown here. SUMO-FGF21 was eluted using PBS containing 10 mM and 20 mM imidazole. expression level of fusion protein containing metallothionein, GST and SUMO was 38.4% of the total supernatant proteins from the organism. expression efficiency may be affected by molecular weight, amino acid constitution, and the function of proteins. rFGF21 was highly purified by SDS-PAGE (Figure 4A) and could react with the human FGF21 polyclonal antibody by Western blot. the purified SUMO-FGF21 was digested by SUMO protease at 4\u00b0C overnight. ml is considered acceptable compared to commercially available proteins. rFGF21 was subjected to MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy analysis. the molecular weight of rFGF21 was 19.424 kDa, close to 19.411 kDa. high dose lowers circulating glucose from 20.25 5.13 mmol/L to 10.83 2.73 mmol/L. different effects may be due to different mechanism in decreasing plasma glucose between insulin and FGF21. rFGF21 acts in a dose-dependent manner to reduce plasma glucose in diabetic rats. ob/ob mice, doses of 125 and 750 g/kg/d of rFGF-21 significantly lowered blood glucose compared with vehicle treatment after 3 days of administration. rFGF21 at doses of 150, 300 or 600 g/kg/d all decreased glucose levels in diabetic mice. gccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc caagaagcagctccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccc the molecular weight of the fusion fragment containing SUMO-FGF21 is shown in Lane 1, 2 and 3. it is 864 bp in length. expression and purification of SUMO-FGF21 Recombinants were inoculated in fresh Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. BL21 (DE3) containing pET-SUMO-FGF21 induced with 1 mM IPTG for 4 h. recombinant bacteria were treated by sonication and centrifugation. supernatants were loaded on a DEAE sepharose FF and Ni-NTA orderly. SUMO-FGF21 concentration is over 25% of all soluble proteins. expression efficiency may be affected by molecular weight, amino acid constitution, and the function of proteins. two-step purification is helpful for improving the purity of rFGF21. rFGF21 was digested by SUMO protease at 4\u00b0C overnight. the target protein was subjected to mass spectroscopy analysis. rFGF21 analyzed by MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy was 19.424 kDa. the first five amino acids of our rFGF21 N-terminus were H-P-I-P-D. rFGF21 acts in a dose-dependent manner to reduce plasma glucose in diabetic rats. rFGF21 acts in a dose-dependent manner to reduce plasma glucose in diabetic rats. compared to rFGF21, insulin displays a more significant effect in decreasing plasma glucose in diabetic rats. administration of rFGF21 resulted in a dose-dependent reduction in circulating glucose levels in diabetic mice. soluble expression of rFGF21 increased in E. coli; this form is also conveniently isolated rFGF21 than previously described forms. this strategy can be used as a source of reference for expression and purification of other proteins. dNTP and 10 PCR buffer were incubated at 55\u00b0C for 4 min. annealing step was conducted at 55\u00b0C for 5 min and elongation was done at 72\u00b0C for 60 sec to get fragment A. elongation was done at 72\u00b0C for 60 sec to get fragment A. pET-SUMO-FGF21 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) cells. a single transformed colony was grown in 5 ml of LB medium (1% peptone, 1% yeast extract, and 0.5% sodium chloride, pH 7.0) after overnight growth, 500 l of culture was transferred into 50 ml of fresh LB medium. SUMO-FGF21 was eluated with buffer containing different concentrations of NaCl (100-300 mmol/L, pH 9.0), followed by further purification with Ni-NTA resin (Invitrogen) the Ni-NTA resin was washed with wash buffer I (20 mmol/L PBS containing 10 mM imidazole and 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), until OD280 of effluent reached base line. purified rFGF21 was desalted and then loaded onto a C18 column. elution was carried out using a linear gradient of 30-70% acetonitrile. rFGF21 was then desalted with Sepharose G50 column. the endotoxin concentration of rFGF21 was estimated quantitatively using the Chromogenic Tachypleus Amebocyte Lysate (TAL) endpoint assay kit. the assay was performed according to the kit protocol. male Wistar adult rats (weighting at 180-220 g) were randomly divided into the high fat diet group (HFD, n = 40) and the common diet group (NC, n = 8) after being fed a high fat diet for two months values are expressed as means S.E.M. Mean Value Comparisons between two groups were performed using the Student t test. significant differences were considered at P 0.05. pET-3c-SUMO was produced by engineering research center of bioreactor and pharmaceutical development. fragment C, primers P11, P12, P13, and P14 formed fragment D. reaction was denatured at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing for 30 s at 55\u00b0C, extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min, and then a final single extension at 72\u00b0C for 7 min to get the fragment M. isopropyl--D-thiogalactopyranoside was added to the culture at a final concentration of 1 mmol/L. the culture was then incubated for another 4 hours at 37\u00b0C with shaking at 220 rpm. SUMO-FGF21 was separated by 12% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. 6 His-tagged SUMO-FGF21 protein was eluted from the column with wash buffer II (20 mmol/L PBS containing 20 mM imidazole and 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) samples taken at the elution peak were pooled. purity of SUMO-FGF21 was assessed using SDS-PAGE. 5% glycerol, 2.5% SDS, 10% -Mercaptoethanol and 0.005% bromophenol blue were electrophoresed on 12% polyacrylamide gels containing SDS. membranes were washed and incubated with a polyclonal FGF21 antibody. male Wistar adult rats (weighting at 180-220 g) were randomly divided into the high fat diet group (HFD, n = 40) and the common diet group (NC, n = 8) after being fed a high fat diet for two months. one week later, blood was collected and the fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was assayed. XSW and HCG performed in vivo activity assay of rFGF21. YDH supported the SUMO protease and revised the manuscript. all authors have read and approved the manuscript."}
