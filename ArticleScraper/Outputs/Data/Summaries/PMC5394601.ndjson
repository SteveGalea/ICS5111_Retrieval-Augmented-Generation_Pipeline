{"summary": "Canada has a long history of strong terrestrial animal health surveillance and disease control programs based upon officially designated, federally reportable, and notifiable diseases (1). it is a challenge to create a collaborative approach to the rapid identification, characterization, and response to new and emerging diseases. designing a formal, coordinated, national surveillance system for these diseases has been the subject of a great deal of effort over the last 35 years. an effective surveillance system underpins our ability to: trade in live animals and agricultural products internationally, protect the public from zoonotic diseases and related food-borne illnesses. an effective one health approach to animal health surveillance is essential to protect farmed animals, wildlife and humans. an effective one health approach to animal health surveillance is essential to protect farmed animals, wildlife and humans. the establishment of a coordinated, comprehensive national approach to animal health surveillance for emerging diseases has been in development for many decades in Canada. the establishment of a coordinated, comprehensive national approach to animal health surveillance for emerging diseases has been in development for many decades. the establishment of a coordinated, comprehensive national approach to animal health surveillance for emerging diseases has been in development for many decades in Canada. the CAHCC annual conference was discontinued in 2005. it was replaced in 2011 by the NFAHWC Annual Forum. in 2002 a number of the major producer groups and some provinces formed the Canadian Animal Health Coalition to create a stronger voice in influencing the direction of animal health programs. the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network (CAHSN) was disbanded after operating for 6 years. it included partners in federal and provincial animal health departments and diagnostic laboratories, the public health agency of Canada, university animal health diagnostic laboratories, and the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre. the project funding ended just as the surveillance piece was coming to the fore. the CFIA agreed to sponsor a minimalist approach to CAHSN. a significant legacy of CAHSN was to raise awareness of the need for a national collaborative surveillance network that could coordinate response to new or emerging diseases. the Council has played a significant role in promoting strategic thinking in animal health and welfare. since its inception in 2010, the Council has played a significant role in promoting strategic thinking in animal health and welfare. the NFAHWC has continued to advance the notion of a national animal health surveillance system as part of a national animal health system. a number of initiatives were reported to be proceeding simultaneously, including: work is continuing on development of a disease prioritization and categorization tool. work is proceeding to develop a sustainable model of governance for the overarching \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d which has been described as a loosely affiliated distributed system. the approach taken by CAHSS is a significant step forward in the evolution of a national animal health surveillance system. the approach is most likely to succeed in a country such as Canada. the next logical step in this process will be to create a governance and funding model that is more permanent and stable. the federal government was the lead agency for animal health disease surveillance and control in the 1980s. most of the provinces had a provincial veterinarian, but his/her role was not as active as that of today\u2019s provincial and territorial Chief Veterinary Officers. in the 1970s the health of animals Branch of Agriculture Canada established the Canadian Animal Health Consultative Committee (CAHCC) the CAHCC annual conference was discontinued in 2005 and was replaced in 2011 by the NFAHWC Annual Forum. the highly structured format of the CAHCC annual meeting and packed agenda offered limited ability for in-depth comment and further analysis. in 2002 a number of the major producer groups and some provinces formed the Canadian Animal Health Coalition to create a stronger voice in influencing the direction of animal health programs. the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance Network (CAHSN) was disbanded after operating for 6 years. it included partners in federal and provincial animal health departments and diagnostic laboratories, the public health agency of Canada, university animal health diagnostic laboratories, and the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre. a significant legacy of CAHSN was to raise awareness of the need for a national collaborative surveillance network that could coordinate response to new or emerging diseases. a significant legacy of CAHSN was to raise awareness of the need for a national collaborative surveillance network. the Council has played a significant role in promoting strategic thinking in animal health and welfare. the report identified problems with the current surveillance system in terms of a lack of leadership and coordination. there was also a lack of understanding among stakeholders about the value of surveillance. the NFAHWC continues to advance the notion of a national animal health surveillance system as part of a national animal health system. work is continuing on development of a disease prioritization and categorization tool that will help clarify what new or emerging diseases should command CFIA involvement. work is proceeding to develop a sustainable model of governance for the overarching \u201cnetwork of networks\u201d which has been described as a loosely affiliated distributed system. a national animal health surveillance system is most likely to succeed in a country such as canada. the next step in this process will be to create a governance and funding model that is more permanent and stable. this can put at risk the long-term viability of this type of voluntary system. there are no equivalents in human health to the animal industry stakeholders. there are several international models of animal health systems worth examining. animal health Ireland is an industry-led, not-for-profit partnership (15) animal health Australia Animal Health Australia (AHA) is an interesting model that may hold value for Canada. it seeks to balance federal, state, and industry interests. it operates over 50 animal health programs for a number of species (17) government does play an advisory role, but the organization is funded and operated mainly by industry. it works well for diseases that are well-recognized, endemic, and have their primary impact on economic production. animal health and welfare board of England members are nominated by industry. this model is attractive because it includes both layers of governments and producers. it is not controlled by any one entity; therefore, collaborative solutions must be found. if the Animal Health Australia model holds value, the next logical step would be to create a not-for-profit corporation. the Canadian Animal Health Surveillance System shows promise for linking the networks, tools, and capabilities that currently exist. to be useful it must serve the needs of its primary clients. the next step should be to create an operational and independently funded program under the National Farmed Animal Health and Welfare Council. the informal networks that have been developed have been quite effective at detecting new or emerging issues as long as there has been some way to share that information. national coordination requires dedicated personnel and financial resources over a longer term. the CAHSN laboratory network was successful at improving the national surge capacity for diagnosing foreign animal diseases. the recent leadership of the NFAHW Council has brought together many partners under a common vision. this is an encouraging development, as building within this framework will ultimately strengthen all participants. national coordination requires dedicated personnel and financial resources over a longer term. a 3- or 4-year window of funding may not be sufficient to develop and establish a new system. the diversity of surveillance systems across Canada creates technical hurdles for epidemiologists. building within this framework will ultimately strengthen all participants. further expansion of the Council\u2019s existing policy advisory role to include hands-on operational capacity will be critical to advancement."}
