{"summary": "antiviral drug resistance is a serious problem, especially when combating RNA viruses due to their high mutation rate and potential for rapid adaptation. system biology approaches have been instrumental in advancing our knowledge of the proteins and cellular pathways that influence +RNA virus infection. a number of relevant host proteins have been described already (15\u201317 and reviewed in references 2 and 18) a similar outbreak of coronavirus-induced severe respiratory disease has been developing in a number of arab countries since April 2012. the causative agent, Middle East respiratory syndrome-coronavirus (MERS-CoV), was identified as a previously unknown member of the betacoronavirus subgroup 2c (24, 25) these developments highlight the importance of developing antiviral approaches to combat coronavirus infections. the nucleocapsid (N) protein (33) and the products of SARS-CoV open reading frame 3b (ORF3b) and ORF6 (34\u201337) have been reported to interfere with interferon induction and/or signaling. in addition, the SARS-CoV E protein has been shown to manipulate the cellular stress response in cell culture. 293/ACE2 cells have been described as a human 293 cell-derived cell line (41) our recent work established that these cells actually must have originated from a nonhuman primate species that is closely related to the rhesus monkeys Macaca mulatta and Papio anubis. stock solutions (2 M) of siRNA SMARTpools were prepared by dissolving 0.5 nmol of an siRNA SMARTpool in 250 l of 1 siRNA buffer (Dharmacon) the contents of the siRNA library master plates were aliquoted into volumes appropriate for individual screening experiments. the sets of 10 deep-well 96-well library plates (Greiner Bio-One) were stored at 80\u00b0C until further use. MAP2K3 (no. LU-003571-00), MAP2K3, PKR (no. LU-003527-00), or siRNA SMARTpools targeting COPB1 (no. L-017940-01) and GBF1 (no. L-019783-00) was performed as described previously (42). twenty-four hours posttransfection, the medium was replaced. raw data from GFP fluorescence and cell viability measurements were analyzed per individual screen with the Bioconductor/R package CellHTS2 (47) with minor modifications. average GFP expression (n = 3) and cell viability were calculated and normalized to the signals of scrambled siRNA-transfected (control) cells. viruses at an MOI of 3 in culture medium containing 8 g/ml Polybrene. at 72 h p.t., cells were infected with wt SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-GFP. depletion of COPB2 was validated by Western blotting. a tertiary mouse anti-biotin-Cy3 antibody was used to visualize protein bands using a Typhoon 9410 scanner. the significance of the association between the data set and the respective pathways was determined in two ways. the significance of the association between the data set and the respective pathways was determined in two ways. the ON-TARGETplus SMARTpool protein kinases siRNA library targets the mRNAs of 779 genes. each individual siRNA SMARTpool consisted of four siRNAs targeting the same gene. a nontargeting (scrambled) siRNA (no. D-001810-10; Dharmacon) served as a negative control. transfection mixes were prepared in the 10 deep-well 96-well plates. we transfected 293/ACE2 cells in black (3 wells per target) and transparent (3 wells per target) 96-well plates. GAPDH enzyme activity in lysates of siRNA-transfected cells was measured at 48 h p.t., using the KDalert GAPDH assay kit (Ambion). lentivirus stocks were prepared according to manufacturer's instructions. wells (4 cm2) containing 8 104 293/ACE2 cells were transduced with shRNA-expressing lentiviruses at an MOI of 3 in culture medium containing 8 g/ml Polybrene. depletion of COPB2 was validated by Western blotting. rabbit anti-MAP2K1 (710446; Life Technologies), rabbit anti-MAP2K3 (sc-961; Santa Cruz), mouse monoclonal antibodies against -actin (28, 48) and the transferrin receptor (TfR; no. 13-6890; Invitrogen) were used to analyze viral protein expression. we performed siRNA screens in 293/ACE2 cells (41) which express the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2. this property facilitated direct comparative studies between these two distantly related nidoviruses. after completion of the siRNA screens, it was discovered that these cells are not of human origin but most likely have originated from an Old World monkey closely related to Papio anubis and Macaca mulatta. no change in cell viability was detected by 48 h p.t. following transfection with either a scrambled siRNA or the GAPDH-specific siRNA (black bars) no significant differences in GFP expression were observed at 24 h p.i. compared to control cells that had not been transfected with siRNAs. RNA screen was performed to identify host cell kinases that affect SARS-CoV-GFP replication according to the experimental set-up outlined in Fig. 2. for each independent siRNA screening experiment, we used a set of ten 96-well library plates, each containing approximately 80 specific siRNA SMARTpools. kinases were considered antiviral when siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced the GFP signal. kinases were considered antiviral when the GFP signal increased upon their knockdown (positive score values) graphics of the hit distribution per plate were visually inspected in order to minimize the chance of false-positive or false-negative hits due to major (technical) artifacts. data were binned into 4 viability categories, as indicated below the x axis. the fraction of the total number of targets (779) in each category is indicated above each bar. for each siRNA pool in the library, the viability data are the averages from nine measurements, resulting from three independent library screens. a total of 90 cellular proteins (19.4% of all targets) were identified as antiviral factors. knockdown of nine of those reduced GFP expression by more than 2-fold. a total of 90 proteins were identified as antiviral factors. each target, the P value, accession number, and gene name are shown. each data point represents the result of a single library screen. the pro- and antiviral hits identified in the siRNA screen were mapped to cellular pathways using the IPA software package. we selected a set of strong and weak antiviral hits for further evaluation. PKR, ANGPT4, CLK1 (>2-fold increase in GFP signal), CDK6 (1.8-fold increase), MAP2K3 (1.6-fold increase), and MAP2K1 (1.2-fold increase) the knockdown efficiency at the protein level for each target was evaluated by Western blotting. h p.t. cells were infected with wt SARS-CoV-GFP at an MOI of 10 (A, C, and E) and fixed 24 h later. the effect of siRNA transfection on cell viability was analyzed in parallel (gray bars), and values were normalized to those of scrambled siRNA-transfected control cells (100%). t SARS-CoV revealed poor knockdown efficiencies. the siRNA that gave the best knockdown of MAP2K1 (number 2) had no effect on GFP expression. a clear correlation between the level of MAP2K1 and SARS-CoV N protein expression could not be established. PKR was one of the strongest of the 90 antiviral hits identified in the primary siRNA library screen. a more than 2-fold increase in GFP expression by SARS-CoV-GFP was observed. PKR is a serine/threonine protein kinase that is activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), a hallmark of RNA virus infection. 293/ACE2 cells were transfected with four individual siRNAs targeting PKR or a scrambled control siRNA. at 48 h p.t. cells were infected with SARS-CoV-GFP (MOI, 10) and fixed 24 later. the effect of siRNA transfection on cell viability was analyzed in parallel (gray bars) PKR knockdown increased wt SARS-CoV replication, siRNA-transfected 293/ACE2 cells were infected with wt SARS-CoV and viral protein expression was analyzed by Western blotting. the proviral effect of protein kinase C iota (PRKC) was validated using the chemical inhibitor sodium aurothio. treatment with 0.13 to 20 M sodium aurothiomalate (ATM) was started 2 h prior to infection. in both 293/ACE2 and 293/ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-GFP expression was efficiently inhibited by ATM in a dose-dependent manner. no cytotoxicity was observed at the ATM concentrations used. COPB2 was depleted by transducing 293/ACE2 cells with lentiviruses expressing COPB2 mRNA-specific shRNAs. this reduced COPB2 levels by 70% compared to levels of control cells transduced with a lentivirus expressing a scrambled shRNA. this reduced COPB2 levels by 70% compared to levels of control cells transduced with wt SARS-CoV-GFP. 293/ACE2 cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing a mRNA-specific or a scrambled shRNA. cyclophilin B (CypB) was used as a loading control. cyclophilin B (CypB) was used as a loading control. cells were infected 48 h p.t. at an MOI of 10, and 24 h later. GFP fluorescence was quantified and normalized to that in infected cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA. to further substantiate the importance of COPI-coated vesicles. the siRNA screens were applied to the screening of a commercial human kinome-directed siRNA library (779 targets) 293/ACE2 cells express the SARS-CoV receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 and were found to be permissive to a combination of siRNA transfection and infection with either SARS-CoV or EAV. this property facilitated direct comparative studies between these two distantly related nidoviruses. no change in cell viability was detected by 48 h p.t. following transfection with either a scrambled siRNA or the GAPDH-specific siRNA (black bars) no significant differences in GFP expression were observed at 24 h p.i. compared to control cells that had not been transfected with siRNAs. a human kinome-directed siRNA screen was performed to identify host cell kinases that affect SARS-CoV-GFP replication according to the experimental set-up outlined in Fig. 2. for each independent siRNA screening experiment, we used a set of ten 96-well library plates containing approximately 80 specific siRNA SMARTpools. kinases were considered antiviral when their siRNA-mediated knockdown reduced the GFP signal (negative score values) kinases were considered antiviral when the GFP signal increased upon their knockdown (positive score values) graphics of the hit distribution per plate were visually inspected in order to minimize the chance of false-positive or false-negative hits due to major (technical) artifacts. data were binned into 4 viability categories, as indicated below the x axis. the fraction of the total number of targets (779) in each category is indicated above each bar. targets were considered to have a robust antiviral effect when their knockdown increased reporter gene expression to at least 150%. a total of 90 cellular proteins (19.4% of all targets) were identified as antiviral factors. knockdown of nine of those reduced GFP expression by more than 2-fold. a total of 90 cellular proteins were identified as antiviral factors. proviral (green) and antiviral (red) hits were strongly represented (P 0.05) these pathways included apoptosis, cellular immune response, growth factor signaling, cellular homeostasis, metabolism of complex lipids, and intracellular and second messenger signaling. PKR, ANGPT4, CLK1 (>2-fold increase in GFP signal), CDK6 (1.8-fold increase), MAP2K3 (1.6-fold increase), and MAP2K1 (1.2-fold increase) the knockdown efficiency at the protein level for each target was evaluated by Western blotting. it remains uncertain whether ANGPT4 and CLK1 are true antiviral or false-positive hits, as we could not determine knockdown levels. siRNA was used as a loading control. at 48 h p.t. cells were infected with wt SARS-CoV-GFP. at 8 h p.i., siRNA-transfected cells were infected with wt SARS-CoV. fected cells that were infected with wt SARS-CoV revealed poor knockdown efficiencies. the siRNA that gave the best knockdown of MAP2K1 (number 2) had no effect on GFP expression. a clear correlation between the level of MAP2K1 and SARS-CoV N protein expression could not be established. pletion leads to a moderate but significant and reproducible increase in SARS-CoV replication. PKR was one of the strongest of the 90 antiviral hits identified in the primary siRNA library screen. in two independent follow-up experiments, a more than 2-fold increase in GFP expression by SARS-CoV-GFP was observed. 293/ACE2 cells were transfected with four individual siRNAs targeting PKR or a scrambled control siRNA. the effect of siRNA transfection on cell viability was analyzed in parallel. values were normalized to those of scrambled siRNA-transfected cells (100%) siRNA-transfected 293/ACE2 cells were infected with wt SARS-CoV. transfection with two of the four individual PKR-directed siRNAs (2 and 3) clearly increased the expression of SARS-CoV N protein (Fig. 7C, upper) and also led to an 1-log increase in infectious progeny titers (Fig. 7D). treatment with 0.13 to 20 M sodium aurothiomalate (ATM) was started 2 h prior to infection. in both 293/ACE2 and 293/ACE2 cells, SARS-CoV-GFP expression was efficiently inhibited by ATM. no cytotoxicity was observed at the ATM concentrations used. coatomer protein complex, of which COPB2 is a subunit, contains a total of seven protein subunits (-, -, \u2032-, -, -, -, and -COP) to validate its role as a proviral host factor in SARS-CoV replication, COPB2 was depleted by transducing 293/ACE2 cells with lentiviruses expressing COPB2 mRNA-specific shRNAs. this reduced COPB 293/ACE2 cells were transduced with lentiviruses expressing a mRNA-specific or a scrambled shRNA. cyclophilin B (CypB) was used as a loading control. cyclophilin B (CypB) was used as a loading control. SMARTpools targeting COPB1, GBF1 or a scrambled control siRNA. cells were infected 48 h p.t. at an MOI of 10, and 24 h later GFP fluorescence was normalized to that in infected cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA. depletion of COPB1 resulted in 83% reduction of SARS-CoV-driven GFP expression. this is the first report on a systematic functional genomics study of this kind for any coronavirus. the cells used were not of human origin but must have derived from a nonhuman primate, probably an Old World monkey closely related to Macaca mulatta. this may have increased the number of false-negative hits due to mismatches between siRNAs designed to target human genes. the replication efficiency in cell culture of mutants lacking both ORF7a and ORF7b is unchanged. a wt SARS-CoV isolate was used to rule out artifacts caused by the lack of expression of ORF7a and ORF7b. a list of host proteins involved in SARS-CoV infection is no more than a good starting point for follow-up studies into the role of individual host protein or pathways in the virus replication cycle. previous studies on other viruses, e.g., HIV-1, showed a very limited overlap between hits from independent siRNA screens performed in different laboratories. this MAP kinase signaling pathway is involved in multiple processes. p38 MAPK promotes MHV replication (65), and chemical inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathway restricts HCoV-229E replication (68). overexpression of the SARS-CoV ORF3a (69) and ORF7a (35) proteins activates the p38 MAPK signaling pathway, but the role of this pathway in SARS-CoV-infected cells remains unclear. the antiviral role of CDK6 was confirmed for MHV-infected mice. the virus induces cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase to promote its replication. CDK6 is downregulated in MHV-infected 17Cl1 cells (75) PKR inhibits the replication of the coronavirus IBV. overexpression of a dominant-negative kinase-defective PKR mutant enhanced IBV replication by almost 2-fold. a partial block of PKR activation appeared to be PKR independent. a relatively strong antiviral effect of PERK observed in this study is in line with previous studies suggesting that the phosphorylation of eIF2 in SARS-CoV-infected cells is mediated by PERK activation. the protein kinase C family are serine/threonine protein kinases. PRKC contains an N-terminal PB1 domain that ensures signaling specificity (reviewed in reference 84), and ATM affects the interaction of PRKC with other PB1 domain-containing proteins. blocking the PRKC PB1 domain could decrease MEK5 (85) and NF-B signaling (via p62) and affect cell polarity (via Par6). coronavirus replication is associated with a cytoplasmic reticulovesicular network of modified ER, including double-membrane vesicles and convoluted membranes (28). the biogenesis of these membrane structures and the cellular factors involved have remained largely uncharacterized. the importance of COPI-coated vesicles is further supported by their essential role in the replication of many other RNA viruses. our kinome-wide siRNA screen has identified several cellular proteins and pathways that influence SARS-CoV replication."}
