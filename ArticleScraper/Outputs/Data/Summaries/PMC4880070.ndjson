{"summary": "animal study nine locally bred alpacas were obtained by private sale for use in this study. animals were allowed to acclimate to the facility for 1 week before infection. alpacas A4\u2013A6 were housed together and housed together for the duration of the study. swab specimens were collected daily from all animals for 5 days. animals included nasal turbinates, trachea, larynx, and all 4 lung lobes. samples included brain, kidney, liver, skeletal muscle, heart, spleen, bladder, mesenteric lymph node. animal study nine locally bred alpacas were obtained by private sale for use in this study. animals were allowed to acclimate to the facility for 1 week before infection and were fed hay ad libitum. alpacas A4\u2013A6 were housed together for the duration of the study. nasal turbinates, trachea, larynx, and all 4 lung lobes were humanely euthanized. tissues were fixed in 10% neutral-buffered formalin for >7 days and embedded in paraffin. none of the alpacas had appreciable increase in body temperature during challenge or rechallenge. none of the alpacas had appreciable increase in body temperature during challenge or rechallenge. all alpacas maintained consistent activity level, temperament. infectious virus was detected from animal A6 during days 7\u201314 and from animal A4 only on day 14. we did not isolate infectious virus from animal A5 (Figure 2, panel A) antibody titers in 6 alpacas after experimental infection with coronavirus and after rechallenge on day 70 postinfection*. alpacas A1\u2013A3 were experimentally infected, and alpacas A4\u2013A6 were co-housed with infected alpacas. microscopic analysis of formaldehyde-fixed tissue sections from animals A7\u2013A9 showed mild squamous metaplasia of the epithelium of the turbinates in animal A8. all 3 animals also had follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the draining lymph nodes. all 3 animals also had follicular hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the draining lymph nodes. immunohistochemical analysis detected rare, scattered, virus antigen\u2013positive cells in respiratory epithelium of turbinates. animals A7 and A9 had histopathologic evidence of mild encephalitis with perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes and monocytes and mild gliosis. the 3 co-housed animals (A4\u2013A6) were placed in the room with the infected animals 2 days after initial virus infection. nasal swab specimens were collected from co-housed animals on days 3\u201310 after infection of animals A1\u2013A3 and then 3 times/week through day 19. shedding (nasal swab specimens) in 6 alpacas experimentally infected with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus ( the 3 animals that became infected through contact (A4\u2013A6) shed minimal virus between days 1\u20132 after rechallenge, but not on days 3\u20135. animals that had been experimentally infected were completely protected against rechallenge and did not shed detectable quantities of virus. nasal turbinates, upper trachea, lower trachea, larynx, and all 4 lung lobes were sampled at necropsy from alpacas A7, A8, and A9. Virus was detected in the nasal turbinates, larynx, and trachea of the 3 alpacas but not in any of the lung lobes tested. microscopic analysis of formaldehyde-fixed tissue sections from animals immunohistochemical analysis detected rare, scattered, virus antigen\u2013positive cells in respiratory epithelium of alpaca A8. etiology of the encephalitis observed remains unknown and might have been unrelated to MERS-CoV infection. infected alpacas shed considerable quantities of infectious virus nasally. none of the infected alpacas had a noticeable nasal discharge. infection can easily spread among closely grouped camelids infected with MERS-CoV. experimentally infected animals were completely protected against rechallenge 70 days later. but the animals that were infected shed infectious virus after reinfection. this suggests sterilizing immunity can be achieved. in this issue of Emerging Infectious Diseases (28)."}
