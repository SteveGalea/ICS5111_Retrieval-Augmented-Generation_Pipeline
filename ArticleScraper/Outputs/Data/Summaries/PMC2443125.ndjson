{"summary": "the high prevalence of HIV-1 subtype C in southern africa necessitates the development of cheap, effective vaccines. we compared the expression of this and a truncated Gag (p17/p24) and the p24 capsid subunit in Nicotiana spp. the p17/p24 protein effectively boosted T cell and humoral responses in mice primed by the DNA vaccine pTHGagC. the plant-produced protein has potential for use as a vaccine. more than 40 million people worldwide live with the virus, and 5 million were infected in 2004. expression hosts include crop plants such as Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) and other Nicotiana spp., alfalfa, rice, wheat, potato and soybeans. different expression systems include transient viral vector expression [10-15], Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transient expression [16-18] and generation of stable transgenic plants [19-21] or cultured plant cells [22] expressing the protein of interest. p17 and p24 together contain the highest density of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) epitopes of the HIV-1 proteome [33], suggesting that high anti-p24 antibody titres might be necessary to maintain a disease-free state. p17/24 fusion proteins may form VLPs or tubular structures, which could make them a good carrier for immunogenic presentation of foreign epitopes. studies on plant-expressed HIV-1 vaccines have focused on HIV-1 Env epitopes fused to virus particles or other proteins. a few studies have also been carried out using the Tat protein [47,48] we have previously expressed HIV-1 subtype C isolate Du422 Pr55Gag via recombinant baculovirus in insect cells, and showed that it assembled and budded to form VLPs. in this study we explored and compared the use of transient and transgenic plant expression systems for the production of recombinant HIV-1 subunit proteins p24 and p24/p17. p24 levels obtained with gag ranged from 167 to 17350 g p24/kg fresh leaf wt. wtp24 expressed protein levels were about 1.2 times and hp24 expressed protein levels were at least 10 times less. samples of crude plant sap from N. benthamiana infected with the pBSGngag recombinant TMV RNA showed the presence of VLPs approximately 110 to 120 nm in diameter. expressing HIV-1 p24, p17/24 and Pr55Gag in plants for vaccine purposes. three sets of constructs encoding cytosol-retained, ER-targeted or chloroplast-targeted proteins were generated and agroinfiltrated into plants. p17/p24 was expressed at the highest level compared with expression of both p24 and Pr55Gag (10 to 13 g/kg) in leaf tissue infiltrated with ER-targeted constructs, both p24 and myristylated p17/p24 were expressed at similar levels (4000 g/kg) p17/p24ER 220 levels expressed as g p24 per kg of fresh leaf weight. all genes were Nicotiana spp. codon-optimised. ER, ER and CPT in construct names indicate whether the protein remained in the cytosol. western blot analysis of HIV p17/24 from infiltrated leaves. ER-targeted protein barely visible as a band in adjacent lanes. five putative transgenic plants were generated for pTRA-ERp17/p24-M. eight transgenic lines were generated from pTRA-CPTp17/p24-M-producing transgenic plants. no product was amplified from control plant genomic DNA. was decided to carry out immunological studies in mice using the chloroplast-targeted p17/p24 protein (p17/p24CPT) from the point of view of developing a candidate vaccine it provides a greater number of epitopes for the induction of a broad immune response. the possibility that this protein may form VLPs or tubular structures also supports its use in immunogenicity studies. a higher dose of p17/p24 protein did not increase the magnitude of the immune response to the Gag CD4+ T cell peptide. the level of response to the Gag CD8+ and CD4+ T cell peptides after a prime with pTHGagC and boost with p17/p24 protein was similar to that of two doses of pTHGagC. mice in groups 6 and 7 that were inoculated with the p17 8 groups of immunized mice were evaluated by looking at serum anti-Gag total IgG and IgG subtypes. significant levels (p 0.01) of Gag-specific total IgG antibodies and IgG subtypes above those in the pre-bleed serum were obtained for groups 1 \u2013 5 inoculated with either pTHGagC or primed with pTHGagC then boosted with p17/p24 protein. determination of Gag-specific serum IgG subtypes indicated the presence of significant (p 0.01) levels of IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b and IgG3 above background pre-bleed values. pTHGagC primed mice with pTHGagC or 64 ng leaf protein containing p17/p24 protein induced higher IgG2a than IgG1 levels. boosting with 646 ng p expression of full length Pr55Gag from the wtgag gene was almost undetectable (0.01 g p24/kg fresh leaf wt) compared with Nicotiana spp. codon-optimised ngag-expressed Pr55Gag levels. expressed protein levels from all three versions of the p24 gene were significantly higher (100 to 10000 times greater) than the p24 levels obtained with gag, ranging from 167 to 17350 three sets of constructs encoding cytosol-retained, ER-targeted or chloroplast-targeted proteins were generated and agroinfiltrated into plants. the effects of myristylation of p17/24 were investigated. oplast p24 pTRA-CPTp24 p17/p24 pTRA-CPTp17/p24-NM gag pTRA-CPTgag All genes were Nicotiana spp. codon-optimised M = myristylated; NM = non-myristylated The expression of the recombinant proteins Pr55Gag, p24 and myristylated p17/p24 was measured p24 antigen was detectable in plants infiltrated with buffer only as the control. p24 antigen was detected in plants infiltrated with buffer only as the control. pTRA-Cp17/p24-NM, pTRA-CPTp17/p24-NM and pTRA-ERp17/p24-NM were highest in the ER (241 g/kg), and about the same in cytoplasm and chloroplasts (60 g/kg). transient expression of HIV-1 p17/24 protein in infiltrated N. benthamiana was measured by HIV-1 p24 ELISA 4 days after infiltration. no HIV-1 p24 protein was detected in non-transgenic control samples. eight transgenic plants expressing chloroplast-targeted p24 (np24C) were regenerated. the highest p24 level measured was about half of that reported. transiently-expressed ER-targeted p24 (p24ER) on its own yielded the highest levels of p24 per kg FW. it was decided to carry out immunological studies in mice using the chloroplast-targeted p17/p24 protein (p17/p24CPT) p17/p24 protein is proposed to be more effective in stimulating a cellular immune response. background responses in the absence of peptide and to an irrelevant peptide were not greater than 50 6 sfu/106 splenocytes. the strong response to a Gag CD8+ T cell peptide was increased 2.3 fold (p 0.01) by a booster inoculation with 64 ng of p17/p24 protein. pTHGagC induced a weak response just above background to a Gag CD4+ T cell peptide inoculations with the indicated antigens were given as specified in the methods. ELISPOT analysis of Gag T cell responses was done in triplicate. bars represent the average absorbance SD for triplicate values. the high levels of Gag-specific total IgG in response to pTHGagC of 17 fold above background (p 0.01) increased 40 fold (p 0.01) and 34 fold (p 0.01) above background when the mice were boosted with either 646 ng or 64 ng p17/p24 protein respectively. this difference in the level of Gag-specific total IgG elicited by booster doses of 646 ng and 64 ng of p17/ western blot detection of Gag antibodies in mouse serum was detected using commercial western blot strips as described in the methods. the content of Gag antibody in mouse serum was detected using commercial western blot strips as described in the methods. the inoculation regimen for each set of strips is indicated above the strips. transiently expressing the transgene under the CaMV 35S promoter produced the highest protein yields, up to 4 mg/kg (0.3% TSP) the protein seemed to be relatively stable in these studies; however, results from transgenic plants showed higher recombinant protein yields in the young leaves than in the older. myristylation site on the native Pr55Gag protein is essential for targeting the HIV-1 Pr55Gag protein to the plasma membrane. it is possible that myristylated p17/24 associates with the chloroplast membranes to make higher-order structures. non-membrane associated protein is toxic, which could account very well for the drastic difference in yield of the native and non-myristylated versions of p17/p24. the increase in Gag-specific CD4+ T cells induced by the boost with p17/p24 protein is associated with a substantial increase in the Gag-specific humoral responses. the inoculation regimen induces a mixed Th1\u2013Th2 response with low doses of p17/p24 inducing more of a Th1 type response. technologies have been developed to extract and purify antigens produced in plants for use in vaccines or immunogenic presentation of epitopes on VLPs or virions. a possible advantage lies in the fact that translation of the targeted proteins occurs in the cytoplasm. when they are inside the chloroplast, the targeted proteins are folded correctly, making them more appropriately immunogenic. viral RNA was transcribed from the clones using the RiboMAXTM Large Scale RNA Production System (T7). the RNA was rub-inoculated onto leaves of N. benthamiana plants
