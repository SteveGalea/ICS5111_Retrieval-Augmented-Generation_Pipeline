{"summary": "Luminal ER proteins may be retrieved by means of a C-terminal KDEL sequence that binds to the KDEL receptor to trigger retrograde transport to the ER. the dilysine motif is identified on the adenoviral E3 19 kDa (E19) protein. coatomer motifs have been controversial, but one path of research has led to a clear delineation of the dilysine motif-binding sites. these were mapped initially to the \u2032-COP subcomplex of coatomer. subsequent yeast genetic studies implicated the N-terminal -propeller domains of -COP and \u2032-COP, the sequence-related large subunits of \u2032-COP. we describe 11 high-resolution crystal structures that show how -COP and \u2032-COP bind to a comprehensive series of motifs. we show that the recognition modes of KKxx and KxKxx motifs are distinct, a non-intuitive observation that helps to rationalize the binding mode of the RKxx motif. -COP and \u2032-COP bind with comparable specificity to KKxx and KxKxx retrieval motifs. binding experiments were performed with the same panel of dilysine motifs as full-length \u2032-COP. this experiment used the S. cerevisiae -COP(1\u2013818)/\u2032-COP(651\u2013814) dimer. \u2032-COP likewise binds specifically to the KxKxx motif of Emp47p. the dilysine motifs were fused to the C terminus of glutathione S-transferase (GST) then immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads. \u2032-COP was added to a mix of \u2018background\u2019 E. coli proteins. no specific binding was observed to the p24-family protein p24. -COP and \u2032-COP bind with comparable specificity to a panel of KKxx and KxKxx motifs. -COP and \u2032-COP bind with comparable specificity to a panel of KKxx and KxKxx motifs. the problem of poor solubility of yeast and mammalian -COP proteins hampered previous studies. crystal structures were refined to resolutions ranging from 1.45 to 1.9. aRmerge=100 hi|Ii(h)I(h) is the ith measurement and I(h) is the weighted mean of all measurement of I(h) for Miller indices h. these are the first views of dilysine motifs bound to coatomer unobstructed by crystal contacts. the C-terminal carboxylate group of the KxKxx peptide binds to a basic patch involving residues Arg15, Lys17 and Arg59 (S. cerevisiae \u2032-COP numbering) the two lysine side chains interact with two acidic patches. all the -COP residues that contact the dilysine motif are drawn in the picture. the right panel shows the KKMP peptide together with a difference electron density map calculated following a simulated annealing protocol (SA-omit map; Br\u00fcnger, 1998). the binding mode of the KKxx motif is indicated by the clockwise arrow coloured green. the KKLV peptide is coloured magenta, except for the side-chain nitrogen atoms of the lysine residues (blue) and the terminal carboxylate oxygen atoms (red) -COP/Emp47p, \u2032-COP/Emp47p and \u2032-COP/hWbp1 complexes common to bound peptides. conformations of bound peptides are highly similar (compare, e.g., Figures 2B and D) all the functional dilysine motifs we tested caused a significant heat change upon mixing with -COP and \u2032-COP. a control peptide KKxxSS caused no heat change upon mixing with \u2032-COP. the assay measures the protein/peptide interaction. the lysine side chains of the KKxx motifs are recognized by the acidic patches 1 and 2 but, surprisingly, they bind in a reversed fashion relative to KxKxx. a comparison of the peptide conformations in the \u2032-COP/p25, -COP/E19 and \u2032-COP/yWbp1 complexes shows highly similar conformations. KKxx binding mode is common to the -COP and \u2032-COP binding sites. the binding mode is independent of the sequence context, unaffected by a preponderance of hydrophobic (p25; KKLV), hydrophilic (yWbp1; KKTN) or terminal proline (E19; KKMP) residues. yWbp1; KKTN binds with significantly lower affinity to \u2032-COP (Kd=170.9 M) than to -COP (Kd=36.6 M) these measurements are consistent with a previous study showing a 10-fold lower affinity of the KKTN sequence for \u2032-COP compared to KxKxx motifs. e and \u2032-COP protein used for crystallization are more than sufficient to saturate the binding site; Kd=170.9 M) the juxtaposition of the Tyr33/His31 side chains and the threonine residue of the KKTN motif leads us to propose that an unfavourably close approach of the Tyr33 hydroxyl group impinges on the -branched threonine residue. position 33 is conserved in -COP as either a hist the results confirm the interplay between the Tyr33/His31 residue at the binding site and the 2 position of the dilysine motif. they reveal that threonine is disfavoured by \u2032-COP at the 2 position, hence the reliance of the yWbp1 retrieval motif on a functional -COP subunit for trafficking in vivo. \u2032-COP is coloured according to residue properties: acidic residues coloured red, basic side chains blue and hydrophobic side chains yellow. KxHxx motif was identified as a functional retrieval signal present on the cytoplasmic tail of the spike protein of group 1 coronaviruses and of the SARS coronavirus. ITC measurements showed that the KxHxx motifs of the Insig proteins bind to -COP and \u2032-COP. structures of \u2032-COP bound to the Insig-1 and Insig-2 sequences reveal a highly similar binding mode to the KxHxx motif of PEDVspike. the arginine side chain adopts a unique binding position, outside the circumscribed dilysine-binding site. the arginine residue is extended to form bonds via its guanidinium group to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of \u2032-COP residue Arg185. in all the -COP crystal structures the carbonyl group of Arg213 points away from the binding site. '-COP residue Arg185 (\u2032-COP coloured cyan) points in opposite direction. corresponding carbonyl group of -COP residue Arg213 points in opposite direction. a key salt bridge that maintains local conformation of \u2032-COP is drawn. the AKLD and KRLD test sequences each lose 4-fold affinity. the RKLD sequence binds exceedingly weakly to -COP (Kd>1 mM) the structural correlate of which we infer is the clash of the arginine side chain with the backbone amide group of -COP residue Arg213. \u2032-COP Glu184 is highly conserved as an aspartic acid (or threonine in Saccharomyces spp. -COP); however, the position corresponding to \u2032-COP Arg163 changes in -COP to a conserved glutamine or glutamic acid residue. the binding site seems to be designed to bind dilysine motifs without regard for sequence context. COP and \u2032-COP are designed to bind dilysine motifs with little regard for sequence context. the picture is meant to emphasize how the 1 and 2 residues point away from the dilysine-binding site. al signal binds to both -COP and \u2032-COP, with comparable affinity to other K(x)Kxx sequences. residues surrounding the lysines do not play a dominant role in binding to -COP and \u2032-COP subunits. we suggest that this may allow cargo C termini to nest additional topogenic information in their K(x)Kxx sequences. GST-dilysine fusion proteins immobilized on glutathione sepharose beads were incubated with the \u2032-COP subcomplex plus \u2018background\u2019 protein mix. bound proteins were analysed by 4\u201320% SDS\u2013PAGE and Coomassie blue staining. control dilysine sequences contained two additional serine residues at their C termini. crystal structure of the N-terminal -propeller domain of S. cerevisiae \u2032-COP bound to the KKxx motif of adenoviral E19 protein (magenta worm) view towards the dilysine-binding site indicates the seven blades (or WD-repeat elements) of the -propeller. the polyS-KKSS sequence confers ER residence to a CD8 reporter molecule. no specific binding was observed to the p24-family protein p24. this addition was shown to abolish the ER retention of a CD8 reporter molecule. crystal structures of -COP and \u2032-COP bound to KxKxx retrieval motifs met with two main challenges. the problem of poor solubility of yeast and mammalian -COP proteins was solved by using the Schizosaccharomyces pombe N-terminal -propeller domain. dR factor=100 |FP\u2013FP(calc)|/FP. eRfree was calculated with 5% of the data. both coatomer subunits bind to dilysine motifs via a highly conserved surface region of the -propeller domain. we refer to the acidic patches as patch 1, involving \u2032-COP residue Asp206 that binds to the 3 lysine side chain, and acidic patch 2, involving residues Asp98 and Asp117 binding to lysine 5 of the peptide. patch 2 is occluded by a crystal contact and the 5 lysine side chain of the motif projects away from the binding site. the SA-omit map is calculated at 1.45 resolution and contoured at 3.0. Isothermal calorimetry measurements for -COP binding to KKxx motifs. lower panel shows data fitted to binding isotherms. colouring is as in (A), and the anticlockwise arrow indicates binding mode of the KxKxx motif. the view is rotated 60\u00b0 around a vertical axis to provide a clearer view of the bonding network to the two lysine residues and to the terminal carboxylate group. close correspondence of binding sites of -COP and \u2032-COP is not surprising. only two residues differ, and these are conservative alterations. the close structural equivalence of binding sites accords with the results of pull-down experiments. ITC and crystallography experiments on KKxx and KxKxx motifs define a common and specific binding mode of binding to the -COP and \u2032-COP subunits of coatomer. the motifs adopt a helical conformation at the binding sites. the KKxx and KxKxx motifs adopt distinctive low energy binding modes to accommodate their lysine residues in the acidic patches. a comparison of the peptide conformations in the \u2032-COP/p25, -COP/E19 and \u2032-COP/yWbp1 complexes shows highly similar conformations and sets of contacts at the binding sites. both -COP and \u2032-COP bind to the p25 and adenoviral E19 sequences. the proline-containing E19 motif, KKMP, binds with comparable affinity to -COP (Kd=64.5 M) and \u2032-COP (Kd=49.0 M), while the more conventional KKLV sequence of p25 binds somewhat more tightly to -COP (Kd=11.3 M) than to \u2032-COP (Kd= a molecular explanation will be found in the interplay between the terminal residues of the motif KKTN (but not the upstream residues, TFKKTN, since these lie outside the binding site) the binding sites differ at only two positions, and only one of the two is in the vicinity of the terminal KKTN side chains: namely Tyr33 (\u2032-COP) and its equivalent His31 (-COP) position 33 is conserved in -COP as either a histidine or phenylalanine residue. position 33 is conserved in -COP as either a histidine or phenylalanine residue. KKSN peptide binds more tightly than KKTN to \u2032-COP. \u2032-COP disfavours dilysine motifs that contain a -branched residue (I, T, or V) at the 2 position. \u2032-COP binding site shows structure of the KxKxx motif from Insig-1. the KxHxx sequence adopts a highly similar binding mode to the KxKxx motif. a slight positional shift of the entire residue enables its side-chain 2 nitrogen atom to bond Asp206 of \u2032-COP. the arginine side chain adopts a unique binding position, outside the circumscribed dilysine-binding site. the arginine side chain adopts a unique binding position, outside the circumscribed dilysine-binding site. the arginine residue is extended to form bonds via its guanidinium group to the backbone carbonyl oxygen atom of \u2032-COP residue Arg185. the carbonyl group of -COP residue Arg213 points in the opposite direction, as shown in the overlapped structure (coloured pink) the corresponding carbonyl group of -COP residue Arg213 points in the opposite direction. COP and \u2032-COP sequences in the vicinity of \u2032-COP residue Arg163 (blue dot) the key salt-bridge residue drawn in (B) is conserved in \u2032-COP sequences, but changes to glutamine or glutamic acid in -COP and the salt bridge is lost. the RKxx motif adopts the same conformation in the two distinct complexes in the crystal asymmetric unit. an analysis of structure and sequence conservation in this region of the -COP and \u2032-COP molecules suggests that the specificity of the RKxx motif for \u2032-COP is a phylogenetically conserved feature. -COP and \u2032-COP are designed to bind dilysine motifs without regard for sequence context. -COP and \u2032-COP are designed to bind dilysine motifs without regard for sequence context. the results showed that certain dilysine-containing sequences strongly enforced ER localization (e.g., KKYL and KKTN), whereas others did not (e.g., KKYY, KKTA and KKSP) the adenoviral E19 KKMP sequence is a bona fide retrieval signal. the range of structures and sequences we have explored offer a fairly thorough description of the binding modes, recognition bonding interactions and certain sequence restrictions. a dilysine-type motif adopts one of three possible binding modes, dependent on the combination of the two basic residues\u2014KxK, KK, RK\u2014and independent of sequence context. -COP and \u2032-COP do not discriminate between KKxx and KxKxx motifs. the major unresolved issue in this context is the functional organization of -COP and \u2032-COP in the polymerized COPI coat. a key insight from the cryo-ET study is that protein features near to the three-fold symmetry centre reside close to the membrane surface. most dilysine motifs are presented on cytoplasmic tail sequences that are intriguingly short. this is just compatible with the lengths of cargo cytoplasmic tails. insect cells were harvested 48 h post infection, lysed by sonication. all proteins were brought to 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM dithithreitol (DTT), and were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. histidine tag plus Smt3 was removed by Ulp1 protease cleavage. mutant protein constructs were generated using the Phusion PCR method. cytoplasmic regions of dilysine-containing proteins were fused to the C terminus of GST. Isothermal calorimetry Binding experiments were performed on a microCal ITC200 instrument (GE Healthcare) operated at 25\u00b0C. protein and synthetic dilysine peptide samples were dialysed overnight against separate volumes of the same buffer. crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant buffer containing well solution plus 20% glycerol, and frozen in liquid nitrogen. the \u2032-COP/p25 crystals diffracted synchrotron X-rays beyond 1.5 resolution. the structure was solved by molecular replacement with the program Phaser. crystallization of -COP/peptide complexes used the S. pombe N-terminal -propeller domain (residues 1\u2013327) with five point mutations in a loop region. this 28-residue element was defined previously as a flexible surface loop based on proteolytic analysis of the mammalian protein. model building for protein and peptide was carried out as for \u2032-COP complexes. expression and purification of full-length B. taurus \u2032-COP subcomplex was carried out. the cytoplasmic regions of dilysine-containing proteins were fused to the C terminus of GST. a saturating quantity of GST-dilysine fusion protein was incubated with 10 l of a 50% (v/v) slurry of glutathione sepharose 4B beads. the assay mix was incubated at 4\u00b0C for 45 min and washed once with 100 l buffer A. protein and synthetic dilysine peptide samples were dialysed overnight against separate volumes of the same buffer. s grew at room temperature in 4 days in the space group P212121. crystals were transferred into a cryoprotectant buffer containing well solution plus 20% glycerol. the \u2032-COP/p25 crystals diffracted synchrotron X-rays beyond 1.5 resolution. crystallization used the S. pombe N-terminal -propeller domain (residues 1\u2013327) with five point mutations in a loop region. the purified protein was concentrated to 3.2 mg/ml in 20 mM Tris\u2013HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT and flash frozen. crystal structures were solved using the \u2032-COP(1\u2013301) structure. model building for protein and peptide was carried out as for \u2032-COP complexes."}
