{"summary": "a presumed fear of reprisals has been thought to enable the unchecked spread of misinformation. outreach initiatives have incorporated misleading information and contrived photographs through activists gaining employment in research labs. anti-animal research organizations deny there are beneficial outcomes from animal research. es have been the most successful and cost-effective public health intervention ever introduced. effective control of more recent infectious disease threats, including Legionnaires' disease, HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and avian flu, have also depended on animal research. sometimes misinformation distributed maligns specific researchers. the most threatening acts we have described typically targeted researchers studying primates, cats, or dogs. however, investigators studying rodents increasingly require protection from harassment. the most threatening acts we have described typically targeted researchers studying primates, cats, or dogs. the animal research war by P. Michael Conn and James V. Parker is a thorough resource for additional information regarding this subject. funding for the more \u201cmainstream\u201d organizations opposing the use of animals in research can generally be traced. a leading PCRM member was barred from entering the united kingdom for being quoted as saying that millions of animal lives could be saved if a handful of researchers were killed. the humane society of the united states, with a 2012\u20132013 budget exceeding $100,000,000,26 is not involved with local humane societies. activists' argument is that any lesser legal status of animals is \u201cspeciesism,\u201d analogous to racism and other forms of civil discrimination. anti-animal research organizations deny that there are beneficial outcomes from animal research. the tragedy of birth defects caused by thalidomide might have been prevented had more animal research been mandated. polio vaccination program could not have been achieved rapidly or safely without animal research. researcher Sharon Juliano has had posters placed with her name, picture, and home address. her telephone number has been placed in classified ads claiming that she offers condoms as a public service free to callers. other scientists have had similar experiences. anti-animal research extremists threatening to assassinate a veterinary dean within 12 months. one month later, the dean died as a result of a gunshot wound received while on his private farm. investigators studying rodents increasingly require protection from harassment. in fiscal year 2012\u20132013, PETA was reported to have an annual budget exceeding $35,000,000,20 mostly from individual donations, with some individual and foundation donations exceeding $1,000,000.21 These contributions are allocated to fundraising, advertising campaigns, and protests. only about 2% of the PETA budget is actually allocated toward research into alternatives to animal research. activists' argument is that any lesser legal status of animals is \u201cspeciesism\u201d analogous to racism and other forms of civil discrimination. activists' argument is that any lesser legal status of animals is \u201cspeciesism,\u201d analogous to racism. the customary silence of researchers has been a potent weapon for the animal rights activist. the public is willing to react, as demonstrated by the public stands of AIDS activists in support of continued animal research. despite threats, the organization continued to grow, finally ending its operations in 2011. the genesis and motivation for the formation of CAR was the UCLA Task Force's document in response to multiple attacks at their institution. this document focuses on how universities can best respond to attacks on their scientists. it should be distributed to all universities and research institutions before an attack occurs. the threat to biomedical research has not receded. the threat to biomedical research has not receded. creative efforts must be invested to educate the public about advances in neurology and neuroscience. despite threats, the organization continued to grow, finally ending its operations in 2011 after successful construction of the Biomedical Research Facility. more recently, 700 supporters joined university of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) researchers who faced harassment from anti-animal research activists to call for an end to the intimidation and threats. the role of the university in the protection of researchers is further reviewed by Kordower. neurologists and neuroscientists are in enviable position to be proactive in educating the general public, patients, and students. Drs. Roos, Hauser, Lennon, and Mehler contributed substantive content through all of the phases of developing the manuscript. DISCLOSURE D.Q. Beversdorf is the chair of the Animal Research Task Force for the American Academy of Neurology."}
