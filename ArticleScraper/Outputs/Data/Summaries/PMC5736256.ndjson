{"summary": "national asthma guidelines do not recommend antibiotics during an exacerbation unless the child has an infection or comorbidities. OBJECTIVE Antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) ensure appropriate antibiotic use, reduce health care costs, and minimize antibiotic resistance. prescribing rate of 4/68 (5.9%), a reduction of 25%. the role of an antimicrobial stewardship program is to ensure appropriate antimicrobial therapy in order to optimize clinical outcomes. in infants who present with wheezing, antibiotics may be prescribed if the asthma diagnosis is confounded by a viral-induced bronchiolitis with radiologic findings suggestive of pneumonia. parents may also request antibiotics to be prescribed for their child who presents with a likely viral infection, causing antibiotic-prescribing pressure. inclusion criteria were children between the ages of 6 months and younger than 18 years who were admitted with an asthma exacerbation. comorbidities would justify antibiotic use, such as chronic lung disease, cystic fibrosis, neuromuscular disorders, and Down syndrome. the ASP was carried out in a series of PDSA cycles that assessed the impact/effectiveness of each intervention in real time. the \u201cStudy\u201d phase determined whether our last cycle intervention was effective. this process may consist of several PDSA cycles to ultimately achieve our study goal. the ASP and institutional asthma guidelines were posted on the bulletin board of the unit. this cycle occurred between December 2015 to January 2016. it became apparent that our institution's sepsis protocol significantly influenced the use of antibiotics in the ED. our Key Driver diagram reflects how each Key Driver/stakeholder contributed to each intervention. the process measures were the number of antibiotics prescribed to children admitted with an asthma exacerbation. the first patient prescribed antibiotics without justification presented with an asthma exacerbation, was afebrile, and had clear lung fields on a chest radiograph. the film array was positive for rhinovirus/enterovirus and did not identify Mycoplasma pneumoniae. the second patient presented with an asthma exacerbation and a fever (37.7\u00b0C rectally) cycle 2 was extended into January 2016 when 5 patients were enrolled, 3 received antibiotics and all were justified, revealing an unjustified rate of 2/23 (8.7%) a total of 4 readmissions occurred; however none were due to infections. this is the first QI project to implement an ASP toward asthma. overall, antibiotics were prescribed more frequently in our institution (32%) than reported by Paul et al4 (26.3%) and Vanderweil et al3 (22%). azithromycin is believed to act as an anti-inflammatory agent, as demonstrated in cystic fibrosis. it would be intriguing to demonstrate whether the degree of inflammation in patients with asthma matches that seen with cystic fibrosis. the only way to confirm Mycoplasma infection is either by the presence of a positive polymerase chain reaction or a 2 to 4-fold increase in mycoplasma titers drawn 3 to 4 weeks apart. a continued assessment of antibiotic prescribing in children presenting with an asthma exacerbation will determine any other variances. this practice persists enough for the AAP to set a benchmark for antibiotic use."}
