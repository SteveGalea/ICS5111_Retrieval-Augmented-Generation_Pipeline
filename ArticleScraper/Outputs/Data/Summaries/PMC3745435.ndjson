{"summary": "cytokines, such as interleukin-12 (IL-12) and a variety of other cytokines, are potent stimulators of anti-tumor CTL responses. IL-12 is recognized as a master regulator of Th1/Tc1 responses [13,14] but clinical trials with IL-12 used as a single agent have shown limited efficacy in most cases. IL-27 biology IL-27 is a heterodimeric cytokine composed of two subunits. it is structurally and functionally similar to IL-12, but was classified into the IL-12 cytokine family. co-expression of p28 within the same cell is required for IL-27 to employ its biological functions. immunoprecipitation studies and pull-down assays show that the intracellular domain of WSX-1 is constitutively associated with JAK1 and contributes to tyrosine phosphorylation of STAT1. gp130 constitutively interacts with JAK1/TYK2 and elicits a strong activation of STAT3 [24,29] by studying STAT1-/- and STAT3-/- murine T cells. IL-27 inhibits Th2 and Th17 responses via blocking expression of transcription factors GATA-3 (Th2) and RoRt (Th17) IL-27 also appears to inhibit CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3+ regulatory T cell responses [40,41] another notable function of IL-27 is its ability in inducing IL-10 production in essentially all subtypes of T lymphocytes. IL-27 exerts its antitumor activity through various other mechanisms. in poorly immunogenic tumors such as B16F10 melanoma, IL-27 can enhance NK cell response [55], inhibit angiogenesis [56], and directly suppress tumor cell proliferation [57]. in lung cancer model, over-expression of IL-27 or treatment with recombinant IL-27 can decrease expression of vimentin, COX-2, and its metabolite (PGE2) in IL-27-induced IL-21 was shown to be pivotal for CD8+ T cells to produce granzyme B [63,62]. IL-27 exerts three STAT1/STAT3 activation-mediated effects on tumor antigen specific CD8+ T cells. IL-27 up-regulates anti-apoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2 and inhibits activation of Caspase 3 in activated CD8+ T cells. up-regulation of T-bet and down-regulation of Eomes have been demonstrated in IL-12-stimulated CD8+ T cells previously [52], and are associated with CD8+ T cell differentiation into effector but not memory T cells [52,67]. the controversy of up-regulation of T-bet with down-regulation of IFN- in P1CTL can be explained by IL-27 induction of Bcl-6, which has been shown to inhibit T-bet induced IFN IL-10 in tumor immunity is often controversial, increasing evidence suggests a positive role of IL-10 in the induction of anti-tumor CTL responses. in IL-10-deficient mice, anti-tumor CTL responses were weakened. in IL-10 transgenic mice, anti-tumor CTL responses were primed and shown to be responsible for tumor rejection [3,74] IL-10-deficiency significantly reduced the expression of IL-27-induced survival molecules in CTLs. IL-27 also induces IL-21 production by CD4+ and CD8+. IL-21 is a member of the IL-2 family of cytokines. IL-10-deficient CD8+ T cells do not give rise to good memory response compared to IL-27-stimulated WT P1CTL cells. IL-27 suppresses treg responses in the tumor microenvironment. recent evidence suggests IL-27 may be needed for Treg survival. IL-27-induced IL-10 production actually benefits CTL survival and CTL-mediated tumor rejection. it remains unclear if IL-27 induces PD-L1 expression in CTL cells. if so, it may represent another negative factor for the generation of CTL. selective induction positive features and blocking negative molecules such as PD-L1 will further enhance IL-27-mediated anti-tumor CTL response. IL-27 affects tumor specific CTL responses via a variety of mechanisms. cytokine based cancer therapy are mainly used in the following ways."}
