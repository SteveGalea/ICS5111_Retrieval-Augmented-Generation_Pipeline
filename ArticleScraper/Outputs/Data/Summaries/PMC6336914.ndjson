{"summary": "coinfection with influenza virus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus causes life-threatening necrotizing pneumonia in children. Sporadic incidence precludes evaluation of antimicrobial efficacy. we enrolled 170 children (18 years) with influenza infection and respiratory failure. HODS Patients were prospectively enrolled from December 2008 to May 2016 from 34 sites in the PICFLU study. we excluded patients with preexisting lung disorders; immune compromise; mitochondrial, genetic, or neurologic disorders. patients with non-subtypable influenza A were also excluded. cultures had to come from a sterile site (endotracheal or bronchoscopic specimen, bloodstream, or pleural fluid) positive tests from MRSA colonization screening alone were insufficient to determine bacterial coinfection. pediatric risk of mortality III acute physiology score [28] measured severity of illness within 24 hours of PICU admission. data on antibiotics given in the first 24 hours of PICU admission or prior to PICU admission were collected prospectively. sites collected information on timing of all antibiotics prior to and after PICU admission. samples of blood and endotracheal aspirates (if intubated) were taken at enrollment. viruses tested included respiratory syncytial virus; human metapneumovirus; human rhinovirus; parainfluenza virus; influenza A and B including A subtypes H1, H3, and 2009 pH1N1; coronavirus; and adenovirus. positive tests from MRSA colonization screening alone were insufficient to determine bacterial coinfection. recorded baseline values for laboratory results, vital signs, vasoactive-inotropic dosing, chest radiograph results, and oxygenation were the first recorded values in the PICU. data were considered missing if no values were available. final outcome was tracked to initial PICU discharge date in all patients and up to hospital discharge in patients transferred to the ward. logistic regression, adjusting for age and PRISM III score, was used to confirm the association between mortality and early vancomycin monotherapy vs additional early anti-MRSA antibiotic groups. RESULTS We enrolled 170 children who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria across 34 sites between November 2008 and May 2016. line health statusd Previously healthy (%) 26 (86.7) 43 (70.5) 42 (53.2)e.002 Mild chronic respiratory (%) 2 (6.7) 12 (19.7) 22 (27.6)f.04 Other (%) 2 (6.7) 6 (9.8)g 23 (29.11)f.003 Influenza type.14 Influenza A (%) 19 (63.3) 48 (78.7) 60 (76.0) dSome patients identified with more than 1 in this category. e P.01 compared to influenza\u2013 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. children with MRSA were on average 2 times older than children in both non-MRSA groups (P.001) children with influenza virus\u2013methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (N = 30) compared to influenza with other bacteria identified (N = 61) and influenza with no bacteria identified (N = 79). death in the MRSA-coinfected patients was associated with older age (P =.01) but not with type of influenza virus infection. profound neutropenia was common in patients with influenza\u2013MRSA (n = 27; median absolute neutrophil count [ANC], 360; IQR, 120\u20131190; Supplementary Figure 1) compared to patients with influenza and other bacterial coinfection (n = 51; median ANC, 5610; IQR, 1410\u201310100; both P.0001). one child who died received early clindamycin monotherapy. clindamycin was given to 96.7% of patients (N = 29/30) figure 3 shows whether additional anti-MRSA antibiotics were received in these 29 patients. 7/13 (53.8%) who received vancomycin monotherapy and 14/16 (87.5%) with additional anti-MRSA therapy reported median time between symptom onset and presentation of 4 days (IQR, 2, 5) vs 3 days (IQR, 2, 4), respectively. time to presentation would not have reached statistical significance between the 2 groups. one child who died received early clindamycin monotherapy. clindamycin was given to 96.7% of patients (N = 29/30) -MRSA agent to prevent 1 death would be 2 (95% CI, 1.2, 3.7) the majority of children who survived (11/18, 61.1%) and all 11 who died received extracorporeal life support. the majority of children who survived (11/18, 61.1%) and all 11 who died received extracorporeal life support. 78.5% of initial trough levels were less than 10 g/mL. initial trough levels were not associated with initial vancomycin dose. anti-mRSA antibiotics given within 24 hours of PICU admission were associated with hospital outcomes. clindamycin is the second most commonly prescribed anti-MRSA agent. clindamycin has antitoxin effects in vitro. clindamycin is the second most commonly prescribed anti-MRSA agent. sensitivity analysis shows that longer time from symptom onset to PICU admission was associated with increased fatality. but it was unlikely to explain the association between vancomycin monotherapy and death. we did not collect data on antimicrobial-related adverse events.
