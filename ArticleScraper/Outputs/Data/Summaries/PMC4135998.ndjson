{"summary": "TEXT 3 papers address antiviral drug discovery for the recently emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) over the past few decades, antiviral drug discovery and development have generally followed a path from viral target definition through assay development. lead compound optimization may involve crystallography or molecular modeling studies and also optimization for an improved pharmacokinetic profile. the authors suggest that this compound may serve as a lead compound for development of a broad-spectrum anticoronavirus inhibitor. a potential added benefit may be that the definition of a viral helicase inhibitor may stimulate added attention. de Wilde and colleagues provide a list of their compound library as supplemental information. they discuss whether inhibition is peculiar to lopinavir or to HIV PIs in general (1). this becomes especially relevant if there is a substantial differential between the cellular target and virological 50% effective concentrations (EC50s) antivirals or lead structures can be developed as coronavirus inhibitors. repurposed compounds provide clinical benefit for infected patient."}
