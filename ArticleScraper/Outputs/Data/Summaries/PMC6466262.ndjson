{"summary": "the genus Ebolavirus of the Filoviridae family includes five species: Bundibugyo ebolavirus, Reston ebolavirus, Sudan ebolavirus, Tai Forest ebolavirus, and Zaire ebolavirus. EBOV is the main causative agent of human outbreaks, causing the Ebola virus disease (EVD) EVD is an enveloped, negative-stranded RNA virus characterized by a virion of 80 nm of diameter and a length ranging from hundreds of nanometers to micrometers. the genome encodes for seven structural proteins: the nucleoprotein (N), the virion protein (VP) 24, VP35, VP30, VP40, the glycoprotein (GP), and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (L) the virus is internalized by macropinocytosis, a non-selective process of engulfment. binding efficiency is related to the activity of acid Sphingomyelinase (aSMase) and to the presence of plasma membrane sphingomyelin. the interaction between the processed GP1 and the late endosomal/lysosomal protein Neimann-Pick C1 (NPC-1) leads to GP2-dependent fusion of the viral envelope with the endosomal limiting membrane. the viral nucleocapsid is released into the cytoplasm leading to transcription and replication of the viral progeny. several alternative viral \u201csurrogate\u201d systems have been developed. such systems include viral pseudotypes and EBOV-like particles. the eVLP system is considered the most reliable to molecularly dissect the EBOV life cycle. VSV is a pathogenic virus for livestock while human infection is a rare event associated with an influenza-like illness. it has been used as a model to study many aspects of negative-strand RNA viral entry and replication. virions are not particularly selective with respect to the type of membrane proteins that can be incorporated into the viral envelope. rVSV-deltaG pseudotypes have been widely used in studies focused on investigating mechanisms of EBOV entry into target cells, in the screening of antiviral compound libraries. recently, Chen and co-workers reported the development of pseudovirus infection mouse models for in vivo pharmacodynamics evaluation of filovirus entry inhibitors opening the possibility to easily validate data obtained by in vitro experiments. retroviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate. the viral genome is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA and transported to the cell nucleus, where it is permanently integrated into chromosomal DNA. new particles will be assembled that will incorporate full length genomic RNA and bud from the cell membrane. the most common example is the VSV-G pseudotyped RV. many other viral glycoproteins have also been successfully used. EBOV and Lassa virus are the one of highly pathogenic viruses. VP40 can assemble either as a hexamer, which appears to be involved in budding, or as an octamer that functions in genome replication and RNA binding. co-expressed NP and GP are incorporated into eVLPs and significantly enhance their release. eVLPs have been used to study the pathway of viral entry. transcription- and replication-competent eVLPs (tr-eVLPs) have been developed that allow the study of almost all aspects of the viral life cycle. these eVLPs contain a polycistronic mini-genome that encodes for a reporter protein along with, at least, the viral proteins VP40, and GP. tr-eVLPs appear to represent the most powerful experimental system for the screening of small molecules libraries. the minigenome is replicated and undergoes a secondary transcription (with the expression of the reporter gene) mediated by RNP proteins provided in trans from expression constructs. a new progeny of infectious tr-eVLPs is produced and can be used to transduce new target cells. rVSV-deltaG pseudotypes are able to complete a single round of replication. the system is based on a plasmid encoding the viral genome, containing a reporter gene (GFP) instead of the native gene coding for the glycoprotein G. at the beginning, cells are cotransf. to express the viral genome for the first viral rescue, a plasmid encoding the T7 RNA polymerase is also required. this virus can be used for the generation of a pseudotyped rVSV-G-GFP by transducing cells preventively transfected with a plasmid encoding for the heterologous glycoproteins. then, this virus can be used to transduce target cells. red Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is the most studied and best characterized lentivirus. lentiviral vectors are currently among the most adopted vectors for gene therapy of different human diseases. the last generation of HIV LVs are highly improved in terms of transgene delivery efficiency and safety. VSV is a pathogenic virus for livestock while human infection is a rare event associated with an influenza-like illness. it has been used as a model to study many aspects of negative-strand RNA viral entry and replication. virions with bullet shape of 180 nm per 75 nm from the cell surface. rVSV-deltaG pseudotypes have been widely used in studies focused on investigating mechanisms of EBOV entry into target cells. they have been widely used in studies focused on investigating mechanisms of EBOV entry into target cells, in the screening of antiviral compound libraries, and as vaccine vectors. retroviruses are enveloped RNA viruses that replicate through a DNA intermediate. the viral genome is reverse transcribed into double-stranded DNA and transported to the cell nucleus, where it is permanently integrated into chromosomal DNA. spherical mature viral particles of around 100 nm in diameter will be able to infect new host cells. RVs can be easily pseudotyped with heterologous envelopes to alter their tropism. many other viral glycoproteins have also been successfully used. EBOV and Lassa virus are highly pathogenic viruses. VP40 promotes the formation of virus-like particles (eVLPs) resembling filamentous virions. co-expressed NP and GP are incorporated into eVLPs. eVLPs have been used to study pathway of viral entry. transcription- and replication-competent eVLPs (tr-eVLPs) have been developed that allow the study of almost all aspects of the viral life cycle. these eVLPs contain a polycistronic mini-genome that encodes for a reporter protein along with, at least, the viral proteins VP40, and GP. tr-eVLPs appear to represent the most powerful experimental system for the screening of small molecules libraries. target cells are pre-transfected with plasmids encoding for RNPs. a new progeny of infectious tr-eVLPs is produced and can be used to transduce new target cells. a new progeny of infectious tr-eVLPs is produced. amiodarone, dronedarone and verapamil are ion channel blockers that have been shown to inhibit filovirus entry in cell lines and primary cells. amiodarone seems to reduce virus binding to target cells and to slow down the progression of the viral particles along the endocytic pathway. amiodarone failed to protect guinea pigs from a lethal dose of EBOV. bepridil is a calcium channel blocker that has well characterized anti-anginal properties. it has been reported that bepridil has a strong antiviral activity against EBOV by inhibiting a step of viral internalization. tetrandrine appears as a promising anti-EBOV prophylactic compound, alone or in combination with other drugs. noricumazole A, a potassium channel inhibitor, is an new inhibitor of EBOV entry. despite promising evidence, in vivo studies did not fully support the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of EBOV infection. chloroquine, amodiaquine, hydroxychloroquine, and aminoquinoline have been shown to inhibit filovirus infection in vitro using a pseudotyped virus assay and the authentic EBOV [75]. a retrospective analysis performed on patients treated in liberia with artesunate-amodiaquine during the Western Africa outbreak of EVD. antibiotics and antifungal drugs Teicoplanin and its derivatives potently inhibit the entry of EBOV-GP-pseudotyped viruses in various cell types [83,84] studies on the antiviral mechanism indicated that teicoplanin blocks EBOV entry by specifically inhibiting the activity of cathepsin L, thus avoiding the maturation of GP and the release of the viral genome into the cytoplasm. anti-histamine drugs diphenhydramine and chlorcyclizine have been identified as potential candidates for repurposing as anti-EBOV agents. newer generations of anti-histamine drugs are not able to inhibit EBOV entry, suggesting that the 1st generation anti-histamines are good candidates to develop new anti-EBOV compounds. only one out of two studies successfully confirmed the ability of clomiphene to effectively protect mice challenged with EBOV. in the case of toremifene, protection was obtained only in 50% of the treated animals. clomiphene accumulates in the eye and in the male reproductive tract. in vitro experiments showed that apilimod inhibits infections by EBOV and MARV in primary macrophages and cell lines by interfering with viral particle trafficking and blocking virions at the level of the early endosomes. in vivo experiments did not support the anti-EBOV efficacy of apilimod: this PIKfyve inhibitor failed to protect EBOV-challenged mice. l-2-methylimidazolium iodide, an inhibitor of the eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase, significantly inhibits entry of single-cycle VSV harboring the EBOV GP. several compounds with anti-EBOV entry properties were also selected after a screening analysis by anantpadama and co-workers. dyphyllin derivatives inhibit the vacuolar (H+)-ATPase avoiding endosome acidification. a recent study showed that the inhibitors of cathepsin-l, N-acetyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l-leucyl-l methional and calpeptin block infection of a pseudotyped virus. amiodarone, dronedarone and verapamil are ion channel blockers that have been shown to inhibit filovirus entry in cell lines and primary cells. amiodarone and its main metabolite methyldiethanolamine show an additive effect improving the potential efficacy of amiodarone as an anti-EBOV compound. no significant clinical improvements have been reported in humans treated with amiodarone. bepridil is a calcium channel blocker that has well characterized anti-anginal properties. it has been reported that amiodarone failed to protect guinea pigs from a lethal dose of EBOV. it may interfere with calcium-signaling required for endolysosomal fusion. tetrandrine appears as a promising anti-EBOV prophylactic compound, alone or in combination with other drugs. noricumazole A, a potassium channel inhibitor, is an inhibitor of EBOV entry. chloroquine is a lysosomotropic agent that increases the endosomal pH. chloroquine, amodiaquine, hydroxychloroquine, and aminoquinoline have been shown to inhibit filovirus infection in vitro. no in vivo experiments have been undertaken yet, but a promising result was obtained by a retrospective analysis on patients treated in liberia with artesunate-amodiaquine during the Western Africa outbreak of EVD. anthelmintic drugs albendazole and mebendazole have been reported to inhibit EBOV infection [82]. antiviral drugs terconazole and triparanol have been shown to inhibit EBOV entry. antiviral drugs terconazole and triparanol have been withdrawn due to toxic side effects. the anti-EBOV activity of chloroquine has been reported in several in vitro studies. in vivo studies did not fully support the efficacy of chloroquine. despite promising evidence, in vivo studies did not fully support the efficacy of chloroquine for the treatment of EBOV infection. Suramin is a competitive inhibitor of heparin. it inhibits EBOV infection in cellular models. however, due to its significant side effects, Suramin should be taken into consideration. the psychoactive drug imipramine interferes with the entry of EBOV into target cells. similar effects have been reported for different psychoactive drugs. anti-histamine drugs diphenhydramine and chlorcyclizine have been identified as potential candidates for repurposing. toremifene directly interacts with the EBOV GP, triggering the premature release of the GP2 subunit, thus preventing the fusion process. clomiphene can effectively protect mice challenged with EBOV. only one out of two studies successfully confirmed the ability of clomiphene. in vitro experiments showed that apilimod inhibits infections by EBOV and MARV in primary macrophages and cell lines by interfering with viral particle trafficking and blocking virions at the level of the early endosomes. in vivo experiments did not support the anti-EBOV efficacy of apilimod. Isothiazolo[4,3- b]pyridine-based inhibitors of GAK have been reported to efficiently inhibit the in vitro infection of EBOV, dengue and chikungunya viruses. the antiviral activity of this compound is not due to its activity as kinase inhibitor but most likely to its lysosomotropic properties. retro-2 is a small molecule effective against a range of bacteria, toxins, and viruses both in vitro and in vivo. eVLPs and pseudotyped virus-based experiments indicated that these compounds block EBOV infection at the final step of viral entry. U18666A is a cholesterol synthesis and transport inhibitor widely used in the field of lipid research. its efficacy has been tested against important human pathogens, including EBOV. the development of effective anti-EBOV therapeutics is a top public health priority. the production of large amount of soluble GP forms by the original virus can interfere with the efficacy of the antiviral activity. in the case of compounds acting on host cell functions, it is also possible to evaluate if multiple cellular targets contribute to the antiviral efficacy. research of new molecules targeting different viral or host factors should allow obtaining efficient antiviral cocktails."}
