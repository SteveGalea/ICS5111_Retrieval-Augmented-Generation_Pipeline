{"summary": "RNA viral populations consist of mutant spectra (or mutant clouds) rather than genomes with the same nucleotide sequence. mutation rates are such that it is unlikely to produce inside any infected cell a progeny viral RNA molecule identical to its immediate parental template. mutant spectra are the source of virus adaptability because they constitute dynamic repositories of genotypic and phenotypic viral variants. this review is centered on the principles of viral quasispecies and their relevance for the behavior of viruses. the penultimate section covers quasispecies dynamics for three salient human pathogens: human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV). a complex mutant spectrum can be calculated from nucleotide sequences obtained either by molecular cloning and Sanger sequencing or by ultradeep sequencing. the classic method involves amplification of short nucleotide sequences from a viral population and derivation of corrected reads. the evolution of biological macromolecules had the merit of integrating concepts of information theory with Darwinian natural selection (237) the study represented the first theoretical treatment of self-instructive behavior required for template activity, as a necessity for the origin of inheritable information. a master copy of the self-replicative molecule produces mutant versions with a certain probability distribution. the error threshold value depends on the replication accuracy and the fitness of the dominant or master sequence relative to the mean fitness value of the error copies. the error threshold corresponds to the (mean) mutation rate (per site and replication) at which the frequency of the master sequence becomes very small and vanishes for practical purposes. 0 is the selectivity or superiority of the master sequence relative to the sequences of the mutant spectrum. q is the average copying fidelity of the replicative system, with 1 q the average error rate per site and replication. the second case is of particular importance in virology. physicists, chemists, biologists, and medical experts in infectious diseases are perceived differently. quasispecies are distributions of related but nonidentical nucleotide sequences. quasispecies are dynamic swarms of mutant viruses that they have to confront. alternative terms fail to recognize quasispecies theory as the conceptual origin of mutant spectra. we do not consider it necessary to revisit arguments on why quasispecies theory has been more influential on experimental virology than classical population genetics. aim is to analyze some of the biological implications of viruses replicating as highly complex mutant distributions. a stock of bacteriophage Q contained 8% temperature-sensitive mutants (821). early evidence of phenotypic variation of RNA bacteriophages was reviewed by Horiuchi. mutation rate was 104-fold higher than the values that at the time had been estimated for some DNA bacteriophages. a high mutation rate was consistent with the previously noted phenotypic plasticity of RNA bacteriophages. a high mutation rate was consistent with the previously noted phenotypic plasticity of RNA bacteriophages. viral quasispecies can be taken as a representation of the dynamics of genetic variation, competition, and selection. unless the Q results were exceptional, quasispecies theory signaled a major change in our views on RNA viruses as populations. a virus variant that emerges to slowly increase its frequency in a mutant spectrum need not be generated with a lower-than-average mutation rate. a virus variant that emerges to slowly increase its frequency in a mutant spectrum needs not be generated with a lower-than-average mutation rate. genome 2 in the distribution on the left generates genomes 2 and 3 in the second distribution, until an excess of mutations in genome 2 of the third distribution impedes its replication. a constant evolution in the mutant spectrum can nevertheless yield the same consensus sequence, depicted as a line devoid of mutations at the bottom. the selective advantage of a mutant genome (with its associated cloud) alters the rate of dominance in a population. virologists adopted the term \u201cquasispecies\u201d from a theory on the adaptability of self-replicative entities that might have been key components at the origin of primitive forms of life. a pioneer study by Manfred Eigen on a quantitative treatment of the evolution of biological macromolecules had the merit of integrating concepts of information theory with Darwinian natural selection (237). quasispecies theory established a condition needed to ensure the stable conservation of genetic information. the error threshold means that for any given complexity there is a maximum error rate compatible with the maintenance of that genetic information. the error threshold corresponds to the (mean) mutation rate (per site and replication) at which the frequency of the master sequence becomes very small. this equation describes the dynamics of mutant generation within mutant spectra. the second equation is the error threshold relationship, in which max is the maximum genetic complexity that can be maintained during replication. q is the average copying fidelity of the replicative system, with 1 q being the average error rate per site and replication. the extensions to finite populations of the core concepts embodied in quasispecies theory justify even more the current use of the term \u201cquasispecies\u201d in virology. physicists, chemists, biologists, and medical experts in infectious diseases are perceived differently by physicists, chemists, biologists, and medical experts in infectious diseases. alternative terms to quasispecies, such as intrahost variation, intrahost diversity, mixture of mutants, nucleotide degeneracy, hyperploidy, heterospecies, or heteropopulations, have been proposed. however, alternative terms fail to recognize quasispecies theory as the conceptual origin of mutant spectra. our aim is to analyze some of the biological implications of viruses replicating as highly complex mutant distributions. in 1969, a stock of bacteriophage Q contained 8% temperature-sensitive mutants (821). in the course of the first nucleotide sequencing studies, two different 5\u2032-terminal sequences were found in bacteriophage Q (182) mutation rate was 104-fold higher than the values that at the time had been estimated for some DNA bacteriophages. a high mutation rate was consistent with the previously noted phenotypic plasticity of RNA bacteriophages. experiments with infectious bacteriophage Q were complemented by in vitro experiments on replication of small RNAs derived from standard Q RNA. unless the Q results were exceptional, quasispecies theory signaled a major change in our views on RNA viruses as populations. a virus variant that emerges to slowly increase its frequency in a mutant spectrum need not be generated with a lower-than-average mutation rate. the rhythm of frequency gain depends on the fitness (or capacity to produce progeny) of the newly arising mutant and its surrounding cloud relative to those of the other components of the mutant ensemble. viral quasispecies are represented as horizontal lines and mutations as different colored symbols on the lines. discontinuous lines indicate genomes that have acquired five or more mutations and that cannot survive to act as the template for the next generation of genomes. virologists use the term viral quasispecies to mean distributions of nonidentical but related genomes subjected to a continuous process of genetic variation, competition, and selection. a viral quasispecies should be considered a single replicative unit in an infected cell (177, 414, 444, 719) however, heterogeneous viral progeny from a single cell will invade neighboring cells in culture or from the same tissue or organ in vivo. mutation is a universal class of genetic variation and the basis of the original quasispecies formulation. a quasispecies distribution (represented as in Fig. 2 and 3, with each genome identified with a letter) may hide distinguishable virus subpopulations. positive selection is the process by which a genotype (or set of genotypes) becomes dominant in an evolving population as a result of positive evaluation of phenotypic traits expressed by individuals (or set of individuals) in complex viral quasispecies, a mutant distribution whose components share the selectable trait, rather than a single individual, becomes dominant. the fixed repertoire was enriched in individuals that displayed relatively higher fitness values (520), underscoring the influence of relative fitness (and thus of the fitness landscape of mutant fitness measurements have been equated to the determination of a selection coefficient (514). the consensus nucleotide sequence of a population is reflected in variations of frequency (relative fitness) of subsets of genomes. mutations occur unavoidably when an RNA virus replicates. studies with the animal pathogen foot-and-mouth disease virus unveiled the molecular basis of fitness loss associated with successive bottleneck events of biological clones of the virus. a number of unusual mutations were observed, which had never been detected in field isolates of FMDV or in the same FMDV clones subjected to large-population passages. atypical mutations included those leading to amino acid replacements at internal residues of the viral capsid (2), a point deletion within the the pattern of fitness decrease adhered to a statistical Weibull function (853), which probably reflects an intricate set of interactions that must take place for a virus to give rise to progeny. the remarkable consequences of bottleneck events provide additional evidence of genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity of viral populations, as well as an experimental confirmation of \u201cMuller's ratchet\u201d (540, 571, 572). mutant spectra are far from distributions of neutral mutants. they can hide components that in isolation would display dissimilar biological properties. a small number of genomes taken from a larger ensemble will include a limited repertoire of variants for further replication. a large population is analyzed, all relevant variants will be represented. this scheme illustrates how the viral population size can condition the results of intrahost or interhost virus transmission. current evidence is that bottleneck events are frequent in the course of the life cycles of viruses, not only in the most obvious case of host-to-host transmission. an infected organism is essentially a mosaic of different environments (cells, tissues, organs, and physiological conditions), and fitness is environment dependent. modification of the environment and limitations of population size may perturb (delay or prevent) the process of fitness gain. however, viral fitness is environment and population size dependent. the same FMDV populations subjected to lethal mutagenesis were extinguished when their mutant spectra amenable to amplification reached an average mutation frequency in the range of 4 104 to 3 103 substitution per nucleotide (12, 634, 762) selection for plaque formation rescues a tiny minority amid a majority of genomes that have lost capacity to form a plaque. a small genome size permits a more effective occupation of sequence space. if important phenotypic changes were not dependent on limited numbers of mutations, quasispecies distributions with levels of genetic heterogeneity would not be important for virus adaptability. it influences the capacity of exploration of sequence space, with its implications for adaptability. standard-size genome originated by recombination between genomes with deletions (307). increased stability of viral particles harboring shorter RNAs was possibly due to relaxation of packaging constraints. condition of replication that favor fitness increase can give rise to drastic genetic modifications. the results with FMDV point to particle stability as a mechanism that can trigger the evolutionary event toward genome segmentation (618) the observed evolutionary pattern includes ingredients of gradualism (accumulation of point mutations [307] and of evolutionary shifts (or \u201csaltations\u201d), rendering realistic at the molecular level the occurrence of punctuated equilibria during viral genome evolution (244). the problem arises when the presence and composition of a mutant spectrum affect relevant traits in virus biology. the inappropriate distinction between mutation rate (in mutations introduced per nucleotide copied) and rate of evolution was considered a conceptual flaw (203). high mutation rates permit but do not necessitate rapid evolution. the same virus can display either evolutionary stasis or rapid evolution, depending on its biological environment. evolution is not always understood as a modification of the consensus sequence. a dynamic mutant spectrum has a dual potential to show either stasis or rapid evolution of its consensus sequence. a dynamic mutant spectrum has a dual potential to show either stasis (rates of evolution of around 104 substitution per site per year or lower) or rapid evolution of its consensus sequence (even 101 to 102 substitution per site per year) directional selection is judged by alternating nucleotide sequences. variation of amino acid sequences may be due to limitations in number of acceptable nucleotide or amino acid sequences at some loci. population size, genetic heterogeneity, adaptive capacity, and evolutionary rate are dependent on an interconnected set of parameters. a population of 1 108 particles includes 3.3 106 single mutants and only 26 genomes with 20 mutations. an imaginary representation in only three dimensions of a different occupation of sequence space. viruses in the large sphere have a 100-fold-larger number of potential direct contacts in neighboring positions of sequence space than viruses in the small sphere. a large sphere has a vastly superior number of possibilities to advance toward new regions of sequence space than a small sphere. a viral genome of 10,000 nucleotides has a maximum of 3 104 possible single mutants. this number is below the population size of many natural viral populations, even within a single infected organism. a mutant spectrum can be considered a cloud in sequence space (sphere in Fig. 8B) the cloud shifts its position in response to selective forces, or a new cloud is started as a result of a bottleneck or founder event. any two genotypes are separated by a number of point mutations that never exceed the genome length. a broad mutant spectrum means higher accessibility to multiple points in sequence space. an important parameter is the error rate exhibited by the viral replication machinery. a poliovirus (PV) mutant. a poliovirus (PV) mutant. acid substitution G64S in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (termed 3D) was selected by its decreased sensitivity to the purine nucleoside analogue ribavirin (1--d-ribofuranosyl-1-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) the same G64S mutant was obtained independently in the Andino's and Kirkegaard's laboratories. new fidelity mutants of RNA viruses are becoming available (48, 141, 180) new fidelity mutants of RNA viruses are becoming available (48, 141, 180) this is an important point that deserves additional experimental and theoretical studies. ability have been only partially investigated (546, 547) some of the amino acid substitutions involved in template-copying fidelity are related to resistance of HIV-1 to antiretroviral agents. increased fidelity often resulted in decreased HIV-1 fitness (842, 860) coronaviruses with mutations in nsp14 display either severe defects in RNA synthesis (555) or a dramatic (12- to 15-fold) decrease in template copying fidelity. nsp14-defective mutants are viable, and their capacity to enhance the mutant spectrum complexity appears to be a stable trait. mutant spectrum complexity cannot be considered a neutral trait. if a complex mutant spectrum displays a selective advantage over a narrow one of the same virus, it may be because of increased complementation among components of a wider repertoire of mutants. genomes present in mutant spectra of viral quasispecies may include genomes that represented a record of those that were dominant at earlier phases of the same evolutionary lineage. a 7.6-fold-higher initial fitness of a mutant resulted in 30- to 100-fold-higher frequency when the mutant became a memory genome (708). a memory genome in a viral population is dependent on the relative fitness of the virus destined to become memory. the most frequent genomes of the same quasispecies (32), in accordance with the Red Queen hypothesis (825) the memory level can be durable, but it is gradually lost in replicating populations. alternative mechanism for maintenance of quasispecies memory is complementation and phenotypic mixing-hiding (862) memory genomes confer on viral populations preparedness to respond to selective constraints already experienced by the same evolutionary lineage (reviewed in references 85, 190, and 652) memory genomes confer on viral populations preparedness to respond to selective constraints already experienced by the same evolutionary lineage. the dynamics of memory acquisition is expected to operate in vivo when an antiviral agent is used to treat an infection and an antiviral-resistant mutant is selected and then outcompeted by other components of the mutant spectrum. two competing populations gained fitness in parallel, in agreement with the Red Queen hypothesis. only occasionally a superior mutant arose and excluded other mutants from the competition. deterministic memory loss is not the only process for which a deterministic behavior has been observed in RNA viruses. neutral mutant moved the virus to a different position in sequence space. this led to a contingent neutrality that could explain the deterministic behavior observed. these results are in accord with in silico competitions carried out with simple replicons (864) the average fitness of an uncloned population is higher than the fitness of viral populations grown from individual viral plaques 1, 2, 3, and 4 (215, 224) it is not clear whether complementation was due to coinfection of the same cells or to other, indirect mechanisms. de la Torre and Holland showed that a VSV quasispecies could suppress VSV genomes that in isolation displayed higher fitness than the suppressing population (171). this result represented the first experimental observation that a mutant spectrum could guide the behavior of specific mutants included in the spectrum. a single amino acid substitution could convert an interfering mutant into a noninterfering mutant and vice versa. a single amino acid substitution could convert an interfering mutant into a noninterfering mutant. this result is in agreement with suppression of FMDV infectivity by preextinction, heavily mutagenized FMDV RNA populations. quasispecies can embody evolutionary mechanisms not always reconcilable with those of classical population genetics. the intraquasispecies interactions may be exerted by mutants generated intracellularly within the same replicative ensemble or by exogenous mutants that penetrate into a cell together with the standard virus. polyploidy (the presence of several genome molecules in the same virus particle) has been documented for some viruses (59, 383, 498) virologists use the term viral quasispecies to mean distributions of nonidentical but related genomes subjected to a continuous process of genetic variation, competition, and selection. heterogeneous viral progeny from a single cell will invade neighboring cells in culture or from the same tissue or organ in vivo. this creates a second and successive level of competition among viral particles and viral genomes. mutation is a universal class of genetic variation and the basis of the original quasispecies formulation. hypermutation occurs in viruses with segmented genomes and is responsible for the antigenic shift associated with new influenza pandemics. viral quasispecies depict mutant classes as spheres proportional to number of genomes in each class. positive selection is the process by which a genotype (or set of genotypes) becomes dominant in an evolving population as a result of positive evaluation of phenotypic traits expressed by individuals (or set of individuals) in complex viral quasispecies, a mutant distribution whose components share the selectable trait, rather than a single individual, becomes dominant. fitness measurements have been equated to the determination of a selection coefficient (514). virologists adapted it to quantify relative replication capacity of a virus. mutations occur unavoidably whenever an RNA virus replicates. studies with the animal pathogen foot-and-mouth disease virus unveiled the molecular basis of fitness loss associated with successive bottleneck events of biological clones of the virus. atypical mutations included those leading to amino acid replacements at internal residues of the viral capsid (2), a point deletion within the L (leader protease)-coding region, an elongation of an internal oligonucleotide tract that preceded the second functional AUG. asexual organisms with a small population size and a high mutation rate will tend to incorporate deleterious mutations in an irreversible, ratchet-like manner. fitness decrease due to serial bottleneck passages can be compensated for by subsequent large-population passages. a clone displaying low fitness, pools of five clones were sufficient to maintain or increase fitness. mutant spectra are far from distributions of neutral mutants. a single infectious genome initiates replication and diversification. a small number of genomes taken from a larger ensemble will include a limited repertoire of variants for further replication or to confront a selective constraint. if a large population is analyzed, all relevant variants will be represented. this scheme illustrates how the viral population size can condition the results of intrahost or interhost virus transmission. current evidence is that bottleneck events are frequent in the course of the life cycles of viruses. an infected organism is essentially a mosaic of different environments (cells, tissues, organs, and physiological conditions), and fitness is environment dependent. modification of the environment and limitations of population size may perturb (delay or prevent) the process of fitness gain. however, viral fitness is environment and population size dependent. the same FMDV populations subjected to lethal mutagenesis were extinguished when their mutant spectra amenable to amplification reached an average mutation frequency in the range of 4 104 to 3 103 substitution per nucleotide (12, 634, 762) the consensus sequence in the progression toward virus extinction by lethal mutagenesis remained invariant. a small genome size permits a more effective occupation of sequence space. if important phenotypic changes were not dependent on limited numbers of mutations, quasispecies distributions with the levels of genetic heterogeneity described here would not be important for virus adaptability. recombination of the population consisting of genomes with internal deletions at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI) resulted in the rescuing of the standard-size genome. a plausible mechanism is that deletions occur essentially at random (at frequencies that depend on the replication machinery, particularly polymerase processivity) ed form can overgrow the monopartite, full-length genome. multiple FMDV genomes with a variety of internal deletions arose during replication. results with FMDV point to particle stability as a mechanism that triggers evolutionary event toward genome segmentation (618) the problem arises when the presence and composition of a mutant spectrum affect relevant traits in virus biology. the inappropriate distinction between mutation rate (in mutations introduced per nucleotide copied) and rate of evolution was considered a conceptual flaw. high mutation rates permit but do not necessitate rapid evolution. the same virus can display either evolutionary stasis or rapid evolution, depending on its biological environment. an initial fitness gain of HIV-1 clones in cell culture may occur with an invariant consensus sequence (77) disequilibria can come about by positive selection or by random events. subsets of genomes from mutant spectrum increase in frequency and replace previous distribution, thereby leading to a new consensus. Adaptation of a natural viral isolate to cell culture is an example of modification of a viral population due to the growth of subpopulations in the new environment. directional selection is judged by alternating nucleotide sequences. variation of amino acid sequences may be due to limitations in number of acceptable nucleotide or amino acid sequences at some loci. population size, genetic heterogeneity, adaptive capacity, and evolutionary rate are dependent on an interconnected set of parameters. 2.6 103 genomes with 20 mutations include 3.3 106 single mutants and only 26 genomes with 20 mutations. a population of 1 108 particles includes 3.3 106 single mutants and only 26 genomes with 20 mutations. an imaginary representation in only three dimensions of a different occupation of sequence space. a viral genome of 10,000 nucleotides has a maximum of 3 104 possible single mutants. this number is below the population size of many natural viral populations. a viral genome of 10,000 nucleotides has a maximum of 3 104 possible single mutants. this number is below the population size of many natural viral populations. a mutant spectrum can be considered a cloud in sequence space (sphere in Fig. 8B) the cloud shifts its position in response to selective forces, or a new cloud is started as a result of a bottleneck or founder event. any two genotypes are separated by a number of points that never exceeds the genome length. a broad mutant spectrum means higher accessibility to multiple points in sequence space and higher adaptability reflected in fitness gain and its biological derivations. a broad mutant spectrum means higher accessibility to multiple points in sequence space and higher adaptability reflected in fitness gain and its biological derivations. a poliovirus mutant encoding amino acid substitution G64S in its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (termed 3D) was selected by its decreased sensitivity to the purine nucleoside analogue ribavirin (1--d-ribofuranosyl-1-H-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide) (662) the same G64S mutant was obtained independently in the Andino's and Kirkegaard's laboratories. a limited incorporation of ribavirin into viral RNA and a greater tolerance to new mutational events. the adaptabilities of the high-fidelity G64S polymerase mutant and wild-type PV might have been indistinguishable if the selective constraints had been less demanding. a broad mutant spectrum may prove advantageous or even essential. gene barrier refers to the number of mutations needed for adaptation. a single amino acid replacement can have either a low genetic barrier if its occurrence requires a single transition mutation or a high barrier if it requires two mutations. a broad mutant spectrum can contribute to overcome genetic barriers during selection of mutant viruses. coronaviruses with mutations in nsp14 display either severe defects in RNA synthesis (555) or a dramatic (12- to 15-fold) decrease in template copying fidelity. a coronavirus with a functional 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease and the same virus with an inactive exonuclease appear to be a stable trait. mutant spectrum complexity cannot be considered a neutral trait. if a complex mutant spectrum displays a selective advantage over a narrow one, it may be due to exclusion of interfering genomes or enrichment in specific adaptable subpopulations in the narrower repertoire. genomes present in mutant spectra of viral quasispecies may include genomes that represented a record of those that were dominant at earlier phases of the same evolutionary lineage. a 7.6-fold-higher initial fitness of a mutant resulted in 30- to 100-fold-higher frequency when the mutant became a memory genome. a memory genome in a viral population is dependent on the relative fitness of the virus destined to become memory. memory genomes gained fitness in parallel with the most frequent genomes of the same quasispecies (32), in accordance with the Red Queen hypothesis (825). the memory level can be durable, but it is gradually lost in replicating populations. alternative mechanism for maintenance of quasispecies memory is complementation and phenotypic mixing-hiding (862) the concept of a genetic memory described for viruses was later extended to Drosophila melanogaster (802) memory genomes confer on viral populations preparedness to respond to selective constraints already experienced by the same evolutionary lineage. the dynamics of memory acquisition is expected to operate in vivo when an antiviral agent is used to treat an infection and an antiviral-resistant mutant is selected. two competing populations of VSV gained fitness in parallel, in agreement with the Red Queen hypothesis. only occasionally a superior mutant arose and excluded other mutants from the competition. ayala showed that two species of Drosophila coexisted for many generations despite competing for limited resources. mutant maintained the same fitness as the wild type under normal growth conditions. but under environmental demands it could not attain beneficial mutations. this led to a contingent neutrality that could explain the deterministic behavior observed. mutant with an expanded mutant spectrum entered the central nervous system (CNS) and replicated (832, 833) it is not clear whether complementation was due to coinfection of the same cells or to other, indirect mechanisms. average fitness of an uncloned population is higher than fitness of viral populations grown from individual viral plaques. de la Torre and Holland showed that a mutant spectrum could suppress VSV genomes that in isolation displayed higher fitness than the suppressing population (171). this result represented the first experimental observation that a mutant spectrum could guide the behavior of specific mutants included in the spectrum. a single amino acid substitution could convert an interfering mutant into a noninterfering mutant. an excess of a mixture of interfering FMDV mutants synergistically suppressed the infectivity of standard, infectious FMDV (654) a number of theoretical models have introduced competition, cooperation, and complementation in the description of quasispecies. viral quasispecies can embody evolutionary mechanisms not always reconcilable with those of classical population genetics. the intraquasispecies interactions may be exerted by mutants generated intracellularly within the same replicative ensemble or by exogenous mutants that penetrate into a cell together with the standard virus. polyploidy (the presence of several genome molecules in the same virus particle) has been documented for some viruses. epistasis in an individual genome may blur interactions between two mutations unless epistasis in an individual genome is strong (523) compensatory mutations are key to the maintenance of drug resistance mutations in viral populations. the main features of viral quasispecies described in the previous sections have several biological implications. receptors used by viruses to recognize and penetrate into cells belong to different families of macromolecules (proteins, lipoproteins, glycoproteins, glycolipids, glycosoaminoglycans, etc.) these diverse molecules perform disparate cellular functions and are often present in large numbers (103 to 104 per cell) on the cell surface (155). a single nucleotide or amino acid change in one of the viruses has no effect on its phylogenetic position. however, a single or few amino acid changes can nevertheless profoundly alter host cell tropism and other important phenotypic traits of viruses. the ambiguous situation created is not easy to solve, but it has been suggested that sequence data banks could be expanded to include characterized minority sequences present in the mutant spectrum. hemagglutinin esterases (HEs) are glycoproteins present in coronaviruses, toroviruses, and influenza virus (IV) type C. mutations that lead to amino acid substitutions at external residues of surface proteins may result in modification of the host cell tropism. mutant spectrum (with minority genomes encoding altered proteins that have the potential to use alternative receptors) can play a role. CR5 may favor selection of mutant spectra that can derive a productive infection from using an available (and functional) receptor (46, 687) that new receptor might be different from the one used by the majority of components of the mutant spectrum (45, 46, 61). a single amino acid substitution to eliminate receptor recognition is expected to be a frequent event. mutations that abolish sugar-binding activities of the coronavirus transmissible gastroenteritis virus eliminate the enterotropism of the virus (448) the respiratory tropism and absence of enteric tropism of porcine respiratory coronavirus are associated with a deletion at the N-terminal domain of the coronavirus spike protein. the VP1 loop in which the integrin recognition site of FMDV resides is also a major antigenic determinant of the virus that includes multiple overlapping epitopes (2, 533, 536\u2013538, 829, 830) receptor recognition sites need not be separate from antibody recognition sites. the selective advantage derived from hiding a receptor recognition site from antibody recognition is largely irrelevant. the repertoire of MAb escape mutants expanded relative to the repertoire obtained with the wild-type virus. none of 84 independently isolated MAb SD6-resistant mutations of the parental FMDV C-S8c1 affected the RGD sequence. 100 times in cell culture (C-S8c1p100) expanded to include substitutions at residues G142, D143, and L144. the expansion of the escape mutant repertoire was due to integrin receptors being dispensable for the multiply passaged FMDV. such vaccines generally confer partial immunity because they present the host immune system with a limited repertoire of B- and T-cell epitopes. mutant spectrum composition, together with structural studies, may provide some hints about possible evolutionary outcomes in relation to receptor recognition. 159, 783 complexes between viral attachment proteins and their cognate (standard) cellular receptors may be informative in regard to how related viral proteins can adapt to using alternative receptors. phalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) can render the virus diabetogenic (42) cardiovirulence of coxsackievirus B3 can be determined by a single site at the 5\u2032 untranslated region (815) new human viral diseases have emerged at the rate of about one per year over the last decades. a clone of FMDV (C-S8c1) was passaged at a high MOI to ensure multiple viral particles infected the same BHK-21 cell. at passage 143, a MAb-resistant variant termed MARLS was selected (113) this variant displayed high fitness and killed BHK-21 cells efficiently. a single clone of FMDV can diversify into genetically distinct subpopulations that exhibit a competition-colonization dynamics. a single clone of FMDV can diversify into genetically distinct subpopulations that exhibit a competition-colonization dynamics. a single clone of FMDV can diversify into genetically distinct subpopulations that exhibit a competition-colonization dynamics. the frequency of inhibitor-resistant mutants of viruses is generally in the range of 103 to 105 (reviewed in references 188, 202, 212, and 693) the frequency of inhibitor-resistant mutants of viruses is generally in the range of 103 to 105 (reviewed in references 188, 202, 212, and 693) resistance mutations have been detected in multiple avian, swine, and environmental isolates of the virus. substitutions E119G and E119V conferred multidrug resistance to several NA inhibitors at a considerable fitness cost for the virus. multiple short-range and long-range interactions occur within a protein molecule. high-level resistance to a drug may entail mutations different from those involved in low-level resistance. substitutions that confer drug resistance increase viral fitness when fitness is measured in the presence of the drug. adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) proteins act on double-stranded RNA (594) one of the isoforms of ADAR 1 is a restriction factor for several (but not all) RNA viruses (848) hypermutated viral genomes generated by ADAR can contribute to antibody escape (521, 522) or to the generation of pathogenic hypermutated genomes. viral escape mutants allow virus survival and replication in the face of host immune response. a single serotype has been described for this virus (271, 440) a single serotype has been described for this virus (271, 440) a single serotype has been described for this virus. d viral domain may have a cellular counterpart for which immune tolerance has developed. a hitherto-invariant viral site may find escape routes through substitutions that affect long-term interactions within the target protein and compensatory mutations. new drugs designed to target highly conserved sites within mutant spectra may be included as part of antiviral treatments. the current aim of antiviral interventions is to achieve a low viral load, which often results in decreased pathogenicity. new antiviral strategies can be directed to viral fitness, reducing the chances of fitness recovery during viral replication in the host organisms. a low viral load is at present a major aim of a combination therapy. an induction treatment aimed at reducing the viral load and the number of viral mutants followed by a maintenance regime to sustain a low viral load (840). this strategy has been proposed on the basis of theoretical considerations of viral dynamics, but to our knowledge it has not been tested in experiments. this new antiviral strategy aims at extinguishing viruses through an excess of mutations introduced in viral genomes upon replication in the presence of mutagenic agents. the first experiments that demonstrated a negative consequence of mutagenesis for virus adaptability and survival were performed by John Holland and colleagues. the term lethal mutagenesis was coined by Lawrence A. Loeb, James I. Mullins, and they proposed that mutagenic ribonucleotide ana the error threshold is based on the concept of error threshold of quasispecies theory, modified by experimental findings with RNA viruses. the transition into error catastrophe can be viewed in the case of viruses as the loss of the superiority of the master sequence and a drift in sequence space that would lead to nonfunctional viral genomes. a viral genome and two mutants encode a wild-type (tan, functional) and two mutants (blue and red, increasingly defective and interfering, respectively) proteins as a consequence of mutagenesis acting on a viral genome. a blue protein may rescue some activity when the red protein is dominant but may decrease activity when the wild-type (tan) protein is dominant. mutagenesis increases 100-fold the average mutation frequency of a mutant spectrum. the second panel indicates that high mutation frequencies result in a decrease of the proportion of infectious viral RNA in a population. the bottom box stresses three major events associated with enhanced mutagenesis. lethal mutagenesis can be effective in vivo (709) and a promising first clinical trial in which a mutagenic pyrimidine analogue affected the mutational pattern of HIV-1 in AIDS patients (574) offer interesting prospects. some members of the APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing complex) are diverted from their physiological editing roles in the cell to become part of antiviral functions. nucleoside 5-azacytidine (AZC) enhanced the replicative ability of bacteriophage Q during plaque development in the presence of AZC. in contrast, Q populations were driven to extinction by AZC during growth in liquid medium, unless mutagen-resistant phage was selected. evidence suggests that the determinant element of adverse versus beneficial effects may lie in the proximity to an error threshold for maintenance of genetic information. FMDV with a G62S substitution in its 3D was constructed by site-directed mutagenesis. it displayed a strong selective disadvantage relative to FMDV encoding the wild-type polymerase. a substitution that conferred PV resistance to ribavirin was highly detrimental to a closely related virus encoding a similar polymerase molecule. the mutant virus could incorporate additional replacements at the standard rate to achieve high-level resistance to ribavirin (8, 30, 761) the alternative mechanisms of picornavirus resistance to ribavirin are probably possible in most cases. the wild-type and mutant SSI mutants produced mutant spectra of similar complexities. the mutational bias was prevented in the case of the triple SSI mutant, resulting in escape of extinction by ribavirin. triple SSI FMDV mutant achieved limit the occupation of regions with genomes with high frequencies of A and U. FMDV populations passaged in the absence or presence of ribavirin were analyzed using differential DNA denaturation PCR (3D-PCR), a procedure that selectively amplifies A- and U-rich genomes from a DNA population. ribavirin frequency increased as a result of ribavirin treatment, as expected (651) it is related to a wealth of observations on the presence of inhibitor-resistant viral mutants in natural isolates. the 3D-PCR study with FMDV was also revealing from the point of view of the molecular basis of lethal mutagenesis. few studies have approached combination therapies involving mutagenic agents alone or mutagenic agents and nonmutagenic inhibitors. mutations that conferred resistance of FMDV to ribavirin prevented the extinction of the virus by high doses of ribavirin. but the ribavirin-resistant virus was extinguished by a combination of the mutagenic base analogue 5-fluorouracil and the inhibitor of RNA replication guanidine (648) 5-hydroxydeoxycytidine and antiretroviral inhibitor 3\u2032-azido-3\u2032-deoxythymidine (AZT) (799) mutagenic agent and nonmutagenic inhibitor. mutagens may display a mutagenic activity and an inhibitory activity. interactions between a mutagen and an inhibitor can influence effectiveness of an antiviral treatment, in particular sequential versus combination inhibitor-mutagen administration. increased mutagenesis can have beneficial effects through enhancement of genotypic and phenotypic diversity but deleterious effects when excess mutations jeopardize viral functions. taneous administration of guanidine and ribavirin proved to be more effective to achieve the extinction of FMDV in BHK-21 cells (650) two main factors were identified as being responsible for the advantage of the sequential protocol. one is the enhancement of generation of guanidine-resistant mutants by ribavirin when present together, and this was supported by a theoretical model. the results with FMDV raised the prospect that new antiviral protocols involving a mutagenic agent may not follow the classical combination-therapy paradigm. the results with FMDV raised the prospect that new antiviral protocols involving a mutagenic agent may not follow the classical combination-therapy paradigm. viral Quasispecies Dynamics in Vivo: long-term Virus Evolution. a quasispecies dynamics theory is closely interconnected with practice. a quasispecies dynamics theory is closely interconnected with practice. memory was described in a designed experiment using FMDV (707), and it was shown to occur also with HIV-1 in vivo. the frequency of drug, antibody, or cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutants can best be quantified in experiments designed in cell culture. a genotype of a virus can be viewed as a set of related genomes that have found a high fitness domain and acquired epidemiological relevance associated with replicative or nonreplicative traits. a corollary of the mechanisms involved in quasispecies dynamics is that RNA viruses do not evolve as a result of a linear (or nearly linear) accumulation of mutations. extrapolating from phylogenetic analyses the date of the common ancestor of retroviruses or the year of divergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 (144) additional extrapolations to date ancestral viruses have been made based on strict or relaxed clock models, often resulting in conflicting results. the term epidemiological fitness has been proposed to describe the relative selective advantage that some natural viral isolates manifest over other related (but distinguishable) isolates. the epidemiological advantage of a given virus has many replicative and nonreplicative components, including infection dynamics in any individual host, transmissibility, virion stability, and others. the number of amino acid substitutions needed and the genetic and phenotypic barriers involved are determinant parameters of how likely a modification of cell tropism or host preference will be. the understanding of the dynamics of modification of cell recognition is still fragmentary compared with that of drug resistance or drug dependence. the capacity of a virus to productively infect a cell does not depend only on recognition of a cellular receptor on the cell surface but also on intracellular host factors. the current system of virus classification, despite serving as a fundamental guide to virologists, suffers from serious limitations derived in part from the variable nature of most viruses it intends to classify. a single nucleotide or amino acid change in one of the viruses has no effect on its phylogenetic position. the majority of human rhinovirus (HRV) serotypes bind to intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), while a few HRV serotypes bind members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor family. hemagglutinin esterases are glycoproteins present in coronaviruses, toroviruses, and influenza virus (IV) type C. mutations alone can mediate a shift in receptor recognition. mutant spectrum (with minority genomes encoding altered proteins) can play a role. mutations alone can mediate a shift in receptor recognition. generation of a new receptor recognition site through multiple amino acid substitutions is an event with a high genetic barrier. the newly generated receptor recognition site should obviously have a positive effect on fitness because it permits the virus to penetrate in a new cell type. however, the required amino acid substitutions may negatively affect some other trait such as capsid or surface protein stability. mutants adapted to using HS as receptor must either be acid labile or acquire acid lability through mutation to compensate for the absence of the uncoating activity of ICAM-1. the integrin recognition amino acid triplet RGD is located on a mobile loop of capsid protein VP1 protruding from the capsid surface (2). corresponding virus will not survive unless it can be rescued by complementation. overlap of receptor and antibody recognition sites has been documented with many other RNA and DNA viruses. one of its consequences is the potential of coevolution of host cell tropism and antigenicity. c1 population that evolved to recognize alternative receptors mapped within the RGDL (47, 196, 526, 711) escape mutant repertoires present in mutant spectra can vary depending on biological features that in this case were recognized. the picornavirus FMDV genome includes a major antigenic determinant (amino acid sequence written with the single-letter code) viremia and vesicular lesions are similar to those evoked by the authentic pathogen (72, 202, 260, 260) viremia and vesicular lesions are common in viral quasispecies. mutations do not inflict significant fitness cost or because mutants harboring them can be maintained by complementation. variants with amino acid substitutions I248T in protein 2C and Q44R in protein 3A were selected. only upon further passage was replacement L147P in the antigenic loop of capsid protein VP1 selected. a minority variant arising in an unnatural host may become dominant on reinfection of the original host species. sected a number of contributing sociopolitical and environmental influences, including the zoonotic origin of many human viral diseases. the results have confirmed previous evidence that rodents are a source of multiple viruses, some of which are yet to be classified. the detection of a viral sequence does not imply that an infectious virus is present. a single clone of FMDV can diversify into genetically distinct subpopulations that exhibit a competition-colonization dynamics. a single clone of FMDV can diversify into genetically distinct subpopulations that exhibit a competition-colonization dynamics in which the killer colonizers are suppressed by the competitors that act as modulators of virulence. coinfections may play a role in modulation of virulence in addition to being a source of recombinant viruses. in experiments with serial passages of FMDV in mice, attenuated strains were isolated in organs in which coinfection was more likely. selective constraints can be antiviral drugs, components of the innate immune response, or interfering RNAs, among others. mutations that confer resistance with limited fitness cost likely to be represented in mutant spectra. no escape mutants would be selected, but the survival of viruses would be incompatible with the environmental challenges posed by our biosphere. drug resistance for HIV-1, HBV, and HCV is reviewed in Specific Viral Systems below. a decrease of affinity for a ligand drug can come about through multiple amino acid replacements at different sites. mutations that confer drug resistance increase viral fitness when fitness is measured in the presence of the drug. mutations may be selected for their fitness-enhancing effect, but may not contribute directly to decreasing the affinity for the drug. the innate immune response against viruses has several components, some established on a permanent basis. the immune response poses multiple selective constraints to virus replication. the adaptive immune response poses multiple selective constraints to virus replication. a single serotype has been described for this virus (271, 440). antigenic variants of HAV that probably escaped the immune response evoked by the available vaccines were isolated among immunocompromised individuals (656) partial immunization due either to low immunogenicity of a vaccine or limited capacity of the vaccinees to evoke an immune response may allow continued viral replication and sufficient viral loads to promote the emergence of antigenic and cell tropism variants. codon-deoptimized viruses are attenuated, with an extremely low probability of reversion due to the number of mutations needed to restore part of the codons to those of the original virus. these multiply modified viral genomes constitute a means to study routes of virus escape from deep fitness valleys that cannot consist of the mere reversion of the original lesion or limited numbers of compensatory mutations. combination therapy is a consequence of quasispecies dynamics, due to decreased probability of generating a viral variant with two or more mutations required to escape to a drug combination. combination therapy remains the standard of care to treat diseases associated with highly variable viruses. new antiviral strategy aims at extinguishing viruses through an excess of mutations introduced in viral genomes upon replication in the presence of mutagenic agents. the term lethal mutagenesis is based on the concepts of violation of error threshold (see theoretical and experimental Origins of Quasispecies as a unit of selection) ed by Lawrence A. Loeb, James I. Mullins, and colleagues to describe the loss of replicative potential of HIV-1 in cell culture. they proposed that mutagenic ribonucleotide analogues could be investigated as anti-HIV-1 agents (491) it involves both the design of new compounds and the search for an application to viral mutagenesis of previously described analogues (125, 326, 327, 351\u2013354) the transition into error catastrophe can be viewed in the case of viruses as the loss of the superiority of the master sequence and a drift in sequence space that would lead to nonfunctional viral genomes. experimentally, the events in viruses that are a parallel to violation of the error threshold and entry into error catastrophe have been investigated using a number of virus-host systems. a viral genome and two mutants encode a wild-type (tan, functional) and two mutants (blue and red, increasingly defective and interfering, respectively) proteins as a consequence of mutagenesis acting on a viral genome. an increasing proportion of mutant proteins will accentuate interference (defection) by decreasing the activity of the protein. the transition of viruses into error catastrophe or lethal mutagenesis is a new paradigm in antiviral therapy that has as its main features. mutagenesis may be favored by the multifunctional nature of the great majority of viral proteins (207) and domains within proteins (51, 829) the same amino acid substitution may have multiple negative effects on different steps of the virus life cycle, thereby accelerating its replicative collapse. the RIP (repeat-induced point mutations) system in some filamentous fungi is a defense mechanism consisting of the introduction of mutations in repeated DNA sequences of genetic parasites. it has been proposed that these viruses have evolved to possess a genome of polyhexameric length (a fact known as \u201cthe rule of six\u201d) to prevent the deleterious effects of hypermutagenesis. resistance to ribavirin is not as easily selectable as resistance to nonmutagenic inhibitors. it has not been established whether resistance to a mutagenic agent will be as easily selectable as resistance to nonmutagenic inhibitors. however, an FMDV passaged in the presence of ribavirin did not select substitution G62S. despite the two residues being 13.1 apart, they are connected through a network of interactions that reach the polymerase active site (277) an effect of substitution G62S was to restrict the flexibility of the loop where M296 lies and the ability of the enzyme to bind to the RNA template. the altered enzyme inflicted upon FMDV such a selective disadvantage that substitution G62S could have never been selected unless compensatory substitutions were introduced. triple polymerase mutant termed SSI (8) produced mutant spectra of similar complexities. mutant polymerases were compared with wild-type enzyme. mutant polymerases were compared with wild-type enzyme functionally and structurally. ribavirin resistance in FMDV has been described here in detail to illustrate the capacity of amino acid substitutions near or far from a polymerase active site to modulate replicative parameters for the benefit of a virus. the triple SSI FMDV mutant achieved was to limit the occupation of regions with high frequencies of A and U. ribavirin-untreated populations document the presence of a deep mutant spectrum in nonmutagenized, nonmutagenized, multiply passaged populations of FMDV (651) a major effect of ribavirin was to generate an A- and U-rich repertoire of genomes in a single passage. the high frequency of hypermutated genomes after one passage was not maintained at subsequent passages. mutations that conferred resistance of FMDV to ribavirin prevented the extinction of the virus by high doses of ribavirin. mutations that conferred resistance of FMDV to ribavirin prevented the extinction of the virus by high doses of ribavirin. the use of two mutagenic agents (sequentially or in combination) is conceptually parallel to the administration of two inhibitors. an alternative approach is the use of combinations of mutagenic agents and antiviral inhibitors. ribavirin was considered to be an inhibitor of arenavirus replication. no evidence of mutagenesis was obtained with ribavirin concentrations that suppressed viral replication. this result is not unexpected, because expression of a mutagenic activity associated with incorporation of an analogue into RNA will be dependent upon RNA replication. viral load can be determinant factor of effect of mutagenic agents and antiviral inhibitors. extinction of FMDV by a combination of a mutagenic agent and an antiviral inhibitor was more effective than extinction by the mutagenic agent alone (633, 634) guanidine hydrochloride (GU) was used as the inhibitor and ribavirin (R) as the mutagen. at least two different manifestations of the simultaneous presence of a mutagen and an inhibitor may render suboptimal the transition toward extinction. the results with FMDV raised the prospect that new antiviral protocols involving a mutagenic agent may not necessarily follow the classical combination-therapy paradigm. the theoretical generalization of the FMDV findings came with a model of viral dynamics that described the viral response (progeny infectivity and frequency of guanidine-resistant mutants) quasispecies dynamics must be taken into consideration to interpret long-term virus evolution. the presence of mutant spectra of FMDV in virus-infected cattle was one of the early observations on quasispecies in vivo (194). several observations on VSV population heterogeneity and dynamics had counterparts in vivo (512) replication is increasingly recognized as a shared feature of several viruses and retroelements in cell culture and in vivo (192, 400, 408) shared features also make it likely antiviral approaches can be of general applicability. the possible advantage of sequential versus combination therapies that require introduction of specific parameters has been predicted for nonretroviral RNA viruses. a genotype of a virus can be viewed as a set of related genomes. for viruses with active recombination, mosaic genomes from different parental genotypes may be an additional important source of genomic variation, adaptability, and diversification. for the same virus a higher rate of evolution is obtained when the compared sequences correspond to viruses isolated within a short time span than when they correspond to isolates separated by a long time interval. the operation of a molecular clock follows the tenet of the neutral theory of molecular evolution, implying that rates of evolution reflect mutation rates. evolution through disequilibria of mutant swarms has important immediate effects for short-term, intrahost evolution. evolution through disequilibria of mutant swarms has important immediate effects for short-term, intrahost evolution, but the present evidence has started to indicate it may also condition long-term events. 210 million people infected with HCV constitute a true insidious pandemic. the viruses replicate continuously in their hosts, albeit at different rates. the virus share error-prone replication, attributed partly to the absence of a proofreading-repair activity in the corresponding polymerases. retroviral sequences integrated into cellular DNA will be subjected to relative evolutionary stasis typical of cellular genes. proviral activation will contribute new replicating genomes that correspond to virus that was actively replicating at an earlier phase of the infection. generation of millions of mutant and recombinant HIV-1 variants and competition among them create a dynamic diversity that defies imagination. multiple mechanisms of HIV-1 drug and RNA interference resistance have been described. the dynamics of the generation and increase in frequency of HIV-1 drug-resistant mutants adheres to the basic principles established experimentally. mutations that diminish sensitivity to antiretroviral agents often preexist in infected humans. multidrug-resistant variants can exist in cells as defective quasispecies. recombination can contribute to generate multidrug-resistant strains. low-frequency baseline drug resistance is associated with a higher risk of treatment failure. resistance is less frequent in patients who adhere to HAART and maintain a low viral load than in those who sustain high-level virus replication. resistance may develop very quickly when treatment is suboptimal and viral replication is only partially suppressed. resistance may develop very quickly when treatment is suboptimal. the host immune response generates multiple constraints that act simultaneously upon the virus. this is true of the multiple branches of the innate immune response (52, 645) and acquires an additional dynamic component in the adaptive immune response (multiple B-cell and T-cell epitopes located at different sites in viral proteins subjected to variation) fitness effects are expected to be more pronounced in the case of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutants play a key role in viral persistence (80, 106, 218, 664) the rate of viral escape from a CTL response depends on the magnitude of the response (which itself is dependent on associated HLA alleles), the diversity of the response, and the viral load to which the response is directed. in some elite controllers, a broad CTL response and maintenance of low-fitness CTL escape mutants may contribute to the control of the infection. a reason why the HIV-1 infection is often not controlled by the cellular immune response may be the functional impairment of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, and continued viral replication may lead to their exhaustion. a combination of immunological and pharmacological approaches could be considered in attempts to submerge HIV-1 and other highly variable viruses into deep fitness valleys. the rate of progression to AIDS appears to result from a complex interplay of viral and host factors (references 19, 474, 557, and 753) the HIV-1 genomic sequence of transmitted/founder virus has been developed (720) in the cases studied, the transmitted viruses were CCR5-tropic. an analysis of the CD8+ T-cell response during early stages of the acute infection suggested that the total T-cell response was associated with selection of escape mutants (274) the capacity of T-cell epitopes to tolerate amino acid substitutions correlated with the emergence of escape mutants. multiple types of HBV variants are selected by antiviral treatments or by the host immune response, which arises more slowly than in the case of HIV-1. the cccDNA constitutes a genetic archive of the virus in the same cells where active viral replication takes place. multiple copies of cccDNA can be found in the nuclei of a single infected hepatocyte. the capacity of cccDNA to contribute to actively replicating HBV depends on the \u201creplication space\u201d available, which means the number of cells that can be productively infected in the liver. the intracellular environment and receptors expressed on the host cell constitute powerful constraints for the selection of viral subpopulations, such as those associated with coreceptor usage switch in HIV-1. the dynamics due to coreceptor shift that operates in HIV-1 is unlikely to have a parallel in case of HBV. virus-resistant mutants emerge as a function of host determinants and at least six viral factors. resistance to nucleotide analogues occurs in a considerable proportion of treated patients, albeit with different kinetics of dominance. the cccDNA is responsible for the reactivation of viral replication upon therapy interruption (178, 401, 434, 489, 894) patients tend to have a gradual switch from a YMDD wild-type population at baseline to a 100% lamivudine-resistant population. patients treated with adefovir-telbivudine sequential therapies show distinct changes in divergence. the quasispecies complexity and diversity do not appear to differ between responders and nonresponders to lamivudine at baseline. a strong reduction of viral load followed immediately by mutagenesis should be an effective protocol to prevent selection of drug-resistant mutants. however, these strategies necessitate the development of new anti-HBV inhibitors and specific mutagenic agents. a challenge is to suppress HBV viral loads to prevent recurrence of the infection after liver transplantation. core promoter mutants decrease HBeAg expression through transcriptional downregulation. increased replication capacity and reduced virion secretion may raise viral load in the liver. damage during acute infection leads to fulminant hepatitis. the core antigen-coding region appears to be stable prior to seroconversion. mutations in the basal core promoter that increase binding of liver-specific transcription factors are selected, leading to enhanced viral replication. the determinant of HBV is a loop with immunological and evolutionary implications similar to those of the RGD-containing loop of FMDV. Patrizia Farci has thoroughly reviewed the implications of the quasispecies nature of HCV for evasion of the adaptive immune response and viral persistence, disease progression, liver transplantation, and response to therapy. he says a man-made coevolution established between treatment response and antigenic variation may be accentuated as new immunological or chemotherapeutic interventions are implemented. HCV that replicates in an infected patient has been amply documented by molecular cloning and Sanger sequencing. these evolutionary rates rank among the highest reported for RNA viruses (189) some differences between its replication cycle and those of HIV-1 and HBV are worth highlighting. extrahepatic HCV replication would introduce compartmentalization of viral subpopulations and environmental heterogeneity (286, 502, 627) the availability of cell culture systems that sustain extended multiplication of the entire HCV or genomic replicons has mirrored selective events documented in vivo. evidence includes introduction of fitness-enhancing mutations, selection of drug- and interferon-resistant mutants, and selection of more stable virus particles (431) most acute HCV infections evolve to chronicity. a significant proportion of chronically infected patients will develop severe liver disease (380, 756) graft recurrently infects liver graft in almost all patients. the level of HCV genetic heterogeneity in pretransplant patients predicted disease severity after transplant (481) the level of HCV genetic heterogeneity in pretransplant patients predicted disease severity after transplant (481) the level of HCV genetic heterogeneity in pretransplant patients predicted disease severity after transplant (481) similar differences have been found in patients coinfected with HIV-1 (317) extensive research has been done to correlate nucleotide and amino acid substitutions with the genotype-specific IFN- response. this region has been described as a focal point of quasispecies variation that can predict treatment outcome. a larger number of mutations in V3 and the interferon/ribavirin resistance-determining region (IRRDR) of virus from pretreatment serum was quantitated in a cohort of patients infected with HCV of genotype 1b (247) a single amino acid substitution in NS5A might be associated with a sustained viral response and ALT normalization (595) a possible relationship between specific mutations in the NS5A and IFN- therapy outcome remains an open question. samples from four recently diagnosed HCV-positive individuals were analyzed (847) low diversity in HVR1 was seen during the first 5 weeks after diagnosis. some variants became dominant whereas others tended to decline in number (847), a pattern of mutant replacement (543) typical of quasispecies dynamics. despite the disappearance of viremia, HCV appears to be able to persist for weeks to months at very low levels. but amino acid substitutions in the core-coding regions of different genotypes appear to be related to insulin, oxidative stress, or steatosis resistance. a central issue is whether drug-resistant mutants preexist in HCV populations. mutations confer resistance to protease inhibitors in patients not exposed to the drugs. a high frequency of TPV-resistant variants emerged 2 weeks after treatment. there are at least three major predictors of response to HCV treatment. escape from the host immune response is generally considered a major mechanism of maintenance of HCV persistence (264, 643) viral clearance or it may enhance viral heterogeneity and adaptability, thereby jeopardizing treatment efficacy. the challenge is to understand what are those critical variables so as to act appropriately once the nature of the viral populations we aim to control begins to be understood. major questions related to HIV-1 quasispecies evolution that remain only partially understood are (i) the effect of mutations on the response to antiretroviral treatment, with an ever-increasing catalogue of mutations and combination of mutations that confer different degrees of resistance to one or several antiretroviral agents, and (iii) the interaction of the virus with the different branches of the adaptive immune response. mutations that diminish sensitivity to antiretroviral agents often preexist in infected humans. nonprimary resistance mutations are a consequence of the elevated mutation frequencies. mutations are expected to affect codons related to drug resistance as much as any other sites in the genome. low-frequency baseline drug resistance is associated with a higher risk of treatment failure (43, 314, 322, 409, 550, 630, 764) other studies have not found an influence of minority resistance mutations on the treatment response (551, 659) a major challenge is to target the pool of resting memory CD4+ T lymphocytes and other cells that do not respond to antiretroviral treatment. the administration of mutagenic agents specific for the HIV-1 RT, sequentially or in combination with antiretroviral inhibitors is worth exploring. APOBEC3G and APOBEC3F hypermutate negative-strand reverse transcripts, which results in multiple GA mutations in positive-sense cDNA. this mechanism can be regarded as a natural counterpart of lethal mutagenesis as an antiviral strategy. authors can contribute to HIV-1 variation (716) the rate of viral escape from a CTL response depends on the magnitude of the response (which itself is dependent on associated HLA alleles), the diversity of the response, the viral load to which the response is directed, and the fitness cost associated with the amino acid substitutions needed for escape (304, 415, 528). fitness is an environment-dependent parameter (205), and the rate of epitope evolution is expected to vary in different individual hosts. heterogeneity of the major target host cells marks a difference between HIV-1 and the hepatotropic HBV and HCV. a fitness increase of retroviral immune escape variants need not affect directly the genomic regions related to immune escape (B-cell or T-cell epitopes or their neighborhood in the relevant viral proteins) patterns of HIV-1 evolutionary change have produced conflicting results and multiple interpretations. an early phase involved a rapid linear increase of divergence and heterogeneity of the C2-V5 region of env. a third phase was marked by an invariance or decline of both divergence and heterogeneity. the transition between CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic variants followed stepwise mutational pathways involving multiple, low-frequency intermediate mutants. individual patients varied regarding the number and diversity of variants with any given predicted phenotype. disease progression may relate specifically to some genetic changes (for example, the determinants of host cell tropism) and not to global features of a viral population. retroviral sequences integrated into cellular DNA will be subjected to relative evolutionary stasis typical of cellular genes. proviral activation will contribute new replicating genomes that correspond to virus that was actively replicating at an earlier phase of the infection. generation of millions of mutant and recombinant HIV-1 variants and competition among them create a dynamic diversity that defies imagination. multiple mechanisms of HIV-1 drug and RNA interference resistance have been described (545, 843, 859) the dynamics of the generation and increase in frequency of HIV-1 drug-resistant mutants adheres to the basic principles established experimentally for a variety of RNA viruses. atory mutations are frequently selected to restore fitness (231, 349, 386, 527, 529, 549, 591) multidrug-resistant variants can exist in cells as defective quasispecies. recombination can contribute to generate multidrug-resistant strains by bringing together genomic sequences that each confers resistance to an inhibitor (292, 423, 442, 445, 568, 570, 887) resistance is less frequent in patients who adhere to HAART and maintain a low viral load than in those who sustain high-level virus replication (368). resistance may develop very quickly when treatment is suboptimal and viral replication is only partially suppressed. resistance may develop very quickly when treatment is suboptimal. HIV-1 has evolved both interaction and evasion strategies to cope with the innate immune response. this is true of the multiple branches of the innate immune response (52, 645) and acquires an additional dynamic component in the adaptive immune response (multiple B-cell and T-cell epitopes located at different sites in viral proteins subjected to variation) fitness effects are expected to be more pronounced in the case of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) escape mutants because T-cell epitopes can be located at conserved regions of nonstructural and structural proteins. the rate of viral escape from a CTL response depends on the magnitude of the response, the viral load to which the response is directed, and the fitness cost associated with the amino acid substitutions needed for escape. in some elite controllers, a large proportion of HIV-1-infected individuals maintain a low viral load in the absence of antiretroviral treatment. a reason why the HIV-1 infection is often not controlled by the cellular immune response may be the functional impairment of HIV-1-specific CD8+ T cells, and continued viral replication may lead to their exhaustion. a combination of immunological and pharmacological approaches could be considered in attempts to submerge HIV-1 and other highly variable viruses into deep fitness valleys. the rate of progression to AIDS appears to result from a complex interplay of viral and host factors (references 19, 474, 557, and 753). env sequences predicted to be X4-tropic were identified at least 3 months prior to such sequences being detected in a phenotypic assay (94) the transition between CCR5- and CXCR4-tropic variants followed stepwise mutational pathways involving multiple, low-frequency intermediate mutants. multiple types of HBV variants are selected by antiviral treatments or by the host immune response. despite operation of universal Darwinian principles, the HBV genome and those of other, related animal hepadnaviruses have unique features that modify some of the consequences of the acquisition of mutations. multiple copies of cccDNA organized as minichromosomes can be found in the nuclei of a single infected hepatocyte. the capacity of cccDNA to contribute to actively replicating HBV depends on the \u201creplication space\u201d available. this means the number of cells that can be productively infected in the liver (not to be confused with sequence space of a virus) antiviral drug-resistant variants were more frequent in liver than in PBMC. overlapping reading frames can amplify the phenotypic consequences of mutations. some drug-resistant mutations map in the HBV polymerase. despite important differences between HIV-1 and HBV, the basic Darwinian principles of genetic variation apply to HBV. the dynamics of mutant generation, competition, and selection is noted in vivo even in the absence of external selection pressures such as drug administration or immunotherapy. resistance of HBV to small interfering RNAs in cell culture and in mice has been described (877) the cccDNA is responsible for the reactivation of viral replication upon therapy interruption. patients tend to have a gradual switch from a YMDD wild-type population at baseline to a 100% lamivudine-resistant population. the distribution of genetic variability of HBV shows different patterns in antiviral-treated and untreated subjects. sequential therapies show distinct changes in divergence. the quasispecies complexity and diversity do not differ between responders and nonresponders to lamivudine at baseline. the dynamic changes of quasispecies complexity and diversity during the first 4 weeks correlate with lamivudine antiviral efficacy. liver transplantation offers a situation in which residual virus finds a new environment to multiply and generate fit quasispecies. combination of nucleoside analogues with specific anti-HBV immunoglobulins are currently used with some success. core promoter mutants decrease HBeAg expression through transcriptional downregulation. the frequent double A1762T and G1764A nucleotide exchange results in a substantial decrease in HBeAg expression. increased replication capacity and reduced virion secretion may raise the viral load in the liver. coding region appears stable prior to seroconversion, but mutations are rapidly selected as a consequence of the anticore immune response. mutations in the basal core promoter increase binding of liver-specific transcription factors are selected, leading to enhanced viral replication (335, 792) the S protein contains an exposed major hydrophilic region (residues 110 to 155) which encompasses the antigenic \u201ca\u201d determinant that is important for inducing immunity. the YMDD domain, the S escape mutations have the incredible ability to behave as compensatory mutations that can restore the replication of LMV-resistant HBV (74, 755). the availability of variant databases for HBV should contribute to monitoring of the prevalence of mutations and perhaps anticipating their effect on HBV adaptability (691) cccDNA is the template for the synthesis of pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) and viral mRNAs. the cccDNA constitutes a genetic archive of the virus in the same cells where active viral replication takes place. this has evolutionary implications similar to those of proviral DNA in retroviruses. an alternative model of HBV carcinogenesis involves a virus-mediated increase in the cellular mutation rate. the HBV X protein acts as a potent transcriptional activator and stimulates generation of reactive oxygen species that enhance the cellular mutation rate. one feature concerns the heterogeneity of the cells that support viral infection. 2-coding regions overlap the spacer domain of the polymerase (P) gene. the region encoding HBsAg overlaps with the polymerase domain involved in nucleic acid synthesis. some drug-resistant mutations map in the HBV polymerase can give rise to amino acid substitutions in the surface antigen that can decrease the affinity of the virus for antibodies. resistance to nucleotide analogues occurs in a considerable proportion of treated patients. the virus had the capacity to become resistant to antiviral agents, following basically the same course of events described for HIV-1. reversion (partial or complete) to wild-type virus is often observed after only a few months. the distribution of genetic variability of HBV shows different patterns in antiviral-treated and untreated subjects. nonsynonymous divergence may vary substantially even within a single host. 2.9% of sequence reads from 45 untreated chronically HBV-infected patients were classified as hypermutated. of those, the majority included two of the most common drug resistance mutations that arise from GA changes (515, 689) viral load is a key parameter to allow the virus to explore sequence space to find pathways for drug or multidrug resistance. anti-HBe escape mutants are selected as a consequence of the production of anti-HBs antibodies. the virus can evade the anti-HBe response by reducing or turning off HBeAg expression. the introduction of stop codons may prevent HBeAg production. damage during acute infection increases hepatocyte turnover, induces fibrosis, and increases the chance of hepatocellular transformation and malignancy (807). the prevalence of core promoter variants is about 40%, and they are evenly distributed among the major HBV genotypes. the most frequent amino acid substitutions in S are G145R and D144A (74, 377). the most frequent amino acid substitutions in S are G145R and D144A (74, 377). the overlap between the S and polymerase genes has as a unique consequence for HBV that drug resistance mutations may result in a modification of the antigenic behavior of the virus. Patrizia Farci has thoroughly reviewed the implications of the quasispecies nature of HCV for evasion of adaptive immune response and viral persistence, disease progression, liver transplantation, and response to therapy. the vast heterogeneity of the HCV that replicates in an infected patient has been amply documented by molecular cloning and Sanger sequencing. a mechanism of delayed replication relative to the major liver quasispecies would be through extrahepatic replication in organs such as blood or brain. despite some evidence for extrahepatic replication, compartmentalization of HCV quasispecies is not a settled issue (reviewed in reference 264) infection in cell culture (893) reinforces the Darwinian behavior of HCV in interaction with its host cells. bottleneck events contribute to diversification of HCV (93, 462, 680) HCV genotype 4a dominates in Egypt, presumably due to poorly sterilized needles in a nationwide parenteral treatment of schistosomiasis. homogeneity of the HCV quasispecies continued to increase 4 weeks after OLT, coincident with high levels of immunosuppression. superinfection with different HCV strains within a single patient can lead to the exclusion of one strain by the other. a good fitness level is found, a relative homogeneity can be associated with the replication-competent, disease-provoking subpopulation. enhanced pathogenesis can be associated with high heterogeneity in the process of searching for the adequate subpopulation. the time at which population complexity is examined can be critical. who had at least 4 mutations in the ISDR consensus sequence were more likely to achieve a sustained virological response to IFN-based therapy than those who had fewer than 4 mutations. some studies confirmed these results (117, 455, 577), others with genotype 1b-infected patients did not (644, 718, 731, 868) Figlerowicz and colleagues found that in children with chronic HCV infection, nonresponders included a restricted number of closely related variants. sustained responders included more distant variant classes present in similar proportions. a reduction in genetic diversity in HVR1 is likely to be the result of a more successful and balanced cellular and humoral immune response (266, 642) in nonresponders, farci and colleagues demonstrated that the initial dominant strain persists for at least the first 12 weeks without changes in viral replication levels. amino acid substitutions in core-coding regions of different genotypes appear to be related to insulin, oxidative stress, or steatosis resistance, variable responses in IFN-/ribavirin combination therapy, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 427. emergence of viral resistance to DAAs in chronically infected patients will be a significant problem. hiraga and colleagues investigated emergence of TPV-resistant mutants by ultradeep sequencing using an HCV infectious model in human hepatocyte chimeric mice. mice infected with the wild-type strain developed lower-level viremia than those infected with the wild-type strain. a high frequency (11%) of TPV-resistant V36A variants emerged 2 weeks after the start of treatment. the establishment of persistence is probably influenced by several virus and host factors, and the participation of mutant generation in this step has been questioned (643). in a chimpanzee model, HCV control and clearance were determined by the level of HCV-specific IFN--producing T cells in the liver (803), which is suggestive of an arms race between virus and cellular immunity as well described for HIV-1. Patrizia Farci has thoroughly reviewed the implications of the quasispecies nature of HCV for evasion of the adaptive immune response and viral persistence, disease progression, liver transplantation, and response to therapy (264). despite some evidence for extrahepatic replication, compartmentalization of HCV quasispecies is not a mechanism of delayed replication relative to the major liver quasispecies. extrahepatic replication would introduce compartmentalization of viral subpopulations and environmental heterogeneity. the availability of cell culture systems that sustain extended multiplication of the entire HCV or genomic replicons has mirrored selective events documented in vivo. evidence includes introduction of fitness-enhancing mutations, selection of drug- and interferon-resistant mutants, and selection of more stable virus particles. the observed genetic variation along the HCV genome is not distributed in a uniform manner. there are relatively conserved regions such as the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs), where specific sequences and RNA secondary structures are required for replication and translation functions. homogeneity of the HCV quasispecies continued to increase 4 weeks after OLT. this coincident with high levels of immunosuppression; therefore, relative homogeneity might be explained by a deficient immune response against HCV. competition between different strains can lead to the exclusion of one strain by the other as soon as the first day after OLT. HCV genotype 1 is the most difficult to treat, with approximately 50% patients responding IFN-/R combined therapy. similar differences have been found in patients coinfected with HIV-1 (317) PKR inactivation through a direct interaction of the ISDR may be one mechanism by which HCV avoids the antiviral effects of IFN (303). a larger number of mutations in V3 and the interferon/ribavirin resistance-determining region (IRRDR) of virus from pretreatment serum was quantitated in a cohort of patients infected with HCV of genotype 1b (247) patients chronically infected with HCV usually harbor multiple variants with distinct HVR1 sequences that are present at different frequencies. newly infected patients tend to display virus with lower quasispecies complexity than the virus in the donor (462, 680) acute resolving HCV maybe a result of the transmission of a minor variant that prevails as the dominant species. a reduction in genetic diversity in HVR1 is likely to be the result of a more successful and balanced immune response (266, 642) in nonresponders, Farci and colleagues demonstrated that the initial dominant strain persists for at least the first 12 weeks without changes in viral replication levels. despite the disappearance of viremia, HCV appears to be able to persist for weeks to months at very low levels. CV harboring R70 and L91 are more likely to obtain rapid sustained response (246, 453, 722) emergence of viral resistance to DAAs in chronically infected patients will be a significant problem. a central issue is whether drug-resistant mutants preexist in HCV populations. mice injected with wild-type HCV showed a rapid decline in viremia at the beginning of therapy. a high frequency (11%) of TPV-resistant V36A variants emerged 2 weeks after the start of treatment. no attempt is made to list the steadily increasing number of mutations related to drug resistance. viral quasispecies and a correspondingly dynamic immune system engage. an active immune response may have two opposite effects. it may complete viral clearance or it may enhance viral heterogeneity and adaptability. complexity, and amplitude of the mutant spectrum can exert an influence on the biological behavior of a virus. adaptation will be achieved with a virus displaying the usual range of mutation rates, rounds of replication, and population size. when a large number of precisely defined mutations are needed for a phenotypic change, the presence of a mutant swarm will generally be irrelevant. competition among continuously arising variants will result in increasing viral load and viral fitness. the virus will be enriched in progressively higher-fitness components. a major aim of therapy is to oppose increases of viral load or viral fitness. specific viral strains can be particularly pathogenic, independently of any prior or further exploration of sequence space. it may not be easy to distinguish whether a genomic sequence confers high virulence per se or because it embodies a capacity to reach neighbor populations of sequence space which constitute disease-associated swarms. higher-than-basal mutation rates lead to generation of defector genomes. the transition from dominance of complementation toward dominance of defection has been easily observed with modest increases of mutation rate. the error threshold sets a limit to virus viability when damage to viral genomes is no longer compatible with completion of the virus replication cycle. ing interactions occur because most viral proteins function as homo- or heteropolymeric complexes. interference exerted either by specific viral mutants or by unfractionated mutagenized viral RNAs has yet to be proven. synthetic vaccines or antiviral agents used as monotherapy were doomed to failure. drug interactions that can affect viral deadaptation constitute another manifestation of quasispecies acting as a unit of selection. new developments in the interphase between theory and experiment can be expected in coming years. despite all viruses displaying adaptability, it is not obvious whether complex DNA viruses form mutant swarms. the larger the complexity of a genome, the lower its relative capacity of exploration of sequence space. a similar argument applies to cells, which have genomes orders of magnitude larger than those of viruses. early cellular evolution involved frequent exchanges of genetic material at a stage prior to the establishment of those barriers that defined the genetic lineages that evolved toward the ones we see today. this model proposes a rapid Darwinian evolution, with high rates of lineage extinction and generation close to mechanisms described in this article. prion disease, although no effective therapy is yet foreseen (857) conversion among conformations in a protein originates in alterations of actions among amino acids, dependent on environmental conditions. quantum mechanical fluctuations in chemical bonds that determine mutations in genetic systems may also determine conformations in proteins."}
