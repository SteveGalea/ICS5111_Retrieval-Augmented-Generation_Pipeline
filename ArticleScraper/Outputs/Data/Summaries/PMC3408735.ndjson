{"summary": "ARDS is a complex syndrome with a broad clinical phenotype. it has been challenging to translate the results of cell and animal studies to pharmacologic therapies that reduce mortality in humans. two therapies, lung-protective ventilation and fluid-conservative management, have reduced mortality and morbidity, respectively. a recent report recommends use of three categories of ARDS based on the degree of hypoxemia. mild (200 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 300 mmHg), moderate (100 mmHg PaO2/FiO2 200 mmHg) and severe (PaO2/FiO2 100 mmHg) (8). most investigations have focused on ALI and/or ARDS patients who are already mechanically ventilated. the patient\u2019s hypoxemia steadily worsened during the 48 hours following his initial presentation. the patient\u2019s hypoxemia steadily worsened during the 48 hours following his initial presentation. diagnostic evaluation confirmed H1N1 influenza infection. all cultures for bacteria were negative. 60-day mortality has declined from 36% in 1996\u20131997 to 26% in 2004\u20132005 (20) most recent ARDS Network clinical trials reported a 60-day mortality of 22% in adult patients despite higher APACHE III scores. ARMA-12 refers to the mortality rate of 431 patients enrolled into the higher\u2013tidal volume arm (12 ml tidal volume/kg predicted body weight) variants in more than 25 genes have been associated with developing ALI and/or ARDS. the mechanisms may include priming effects of cigarette smoke exposure on the lung endothelium, alveolar epithelium, or inflammatory cells. genetic polymorphisms that predispose individuals to the injurious effects of specific bacteria may influence the development of ALI and ARDS. PPFIA1 encodes liprin, a protein involved in cell adhesion, integrin expression, and cell-matrix interactions. pathogenesis: dysregulated inflammation, inappropriate accumulation and activity of leukocytes and platelets. altered permeability of alveolar endothelial and epithelial barriers remain central pathophysiologic concepts in ALI and ARDS (1\u20133) acute inflammatory responses to pathogens and their toxins (38\u201340) cause ALI through leukocyte protease release, generation of reactive oxygen species, rampant synthesis of chemokines and cytokines. however, these same inflammatory mechanisms, when controlled rather than excessive, are requisite in pathogen containment and clearance. VE-cadherin bonds induce lung edema formation (54, 55) stabilization of VE-cadherin bonds is a central mechanism of altered endothelial barrier function in experimental ALI. VE-cadherin is an endothelial-specific adherens junction protein that mediates Ca2+-dependent homophilic interactions at the lateral cell membranes of adjacent endothelial cells. -cadherin is regulated by cytoplasmic associations with catenins and actin. disruption of VE-cadherin bonds also facilitates transendothelial migration of leukocytes. several intracellular pathways and mechanisms are implicated (iii) S1P binding to S1Pr1 induces actin cytoskeletal reorganization, RAC activation, localization of -, -, and -catenin and VE-cadherin to regions of intercellular contact. agonists of endothelial S1Pr1 suppress cytokine storm and inflammation-triggered vascular leak in the lungs and systemic vessels of mice. an active fragment of the Robo4 ligand Slit (Slit2N) inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of VE-cadherin and preserves its association with P120 catenin. in mice, Slit2N reduces pulmonary and systemic vascular permeability in LPS lung injury, cecal ligation and puncture, and influenza infection. alveolar epithelial barriers are tighter than alveolar endothelial barriers (70), but the two have functional interactions (2). disruption of endothelial VE-cadherin bonds causes alveolar epithelial leak and epithelial injury. resolution of ALI requires effective and synchronous reabsorption of alveolar edema. resolution of ALI requires removal of alveolar edema fluid, removal of acute inflammatory cells, and repair of the injured alveolar epithelium. alveolar edema fluid reabsorption is driven by vectorial transport of sodium and chloride from the airspaces to the lung interstitium. reabsorption of alveolar edema occurs through vectorial transport of sodium and chloride across alveolar epithelial type I and II cells. this process is impaired in ALI and ARDS because of apoptosis and necrosis of alveolar epithelium (31, 46) lipid mediators such as lipoxin A4, resolvin E1 and other antiinflammatory pathways. macrophages remove apoptotic neutrophils and monocytes via molecular mechanisms. deficiency of alveolar macrophages worsens influenza-related pneumonia and lung injury in mice. ventilation tidal volume downregulates mechanosensitive proinflammatory pathways. reduced neutrophil accumulation in the alveoli and lower plasma levels of IL-6, IL-8, and soluble TNF receptor 1. ALI leads to lung endothelial and epithelial injury, increased permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier, flooding of the airspace with protein-rich pulmonary edema fluid. acute inflammation resolves through apoptosis of neutrophils. ventilation with high tidal volume in rabbits with acid-induced ALI causes apoptosis of renal tubular cells. prone positioning, optimal levels of PEEP, high-frequency ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, and extracorporeal circuits to enhance carbon dioxide excretion have also been tested in clinical trials. plasma levels of angiopoietin-2 were lower in patients who were treated with a fluid-conservative versus a fluid-liberal strategy. abnormalities of surfactant in ALI and ARDS include decreased production, alterations in phospholipid composition, and inhibition of surfactant function by exuded plasma proteins, oxygen radicals, and proteases. vasodilator therapies including prostaglandin E1 and nitric oxide have not reduced mortality. treatment to accelerate resolution of pulmonary edema with aerosolized or intravenous -adrenergic agonists also failed to improve survival. pulmonary edema fluid, activation of alveolar macrophages with release of proinflammatory chemokines and cytokines, increased neutrophil migration and activation. a protective ventilatory strategy can limit further lung endothelial and epithelial injury. acute inflammation resolves through apoptosis of neutrophils, which are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages. the effects of prone positioning, optimal levels of PEEP, high-frequency ventilation, neuromuscular blockade, and extracorporeal circuits to enhance carbon dioxide excretion have also been tested in clinical trials. a fluid-conservative strategy significantly reduced the average duration of mechanical ventilation by 2.5 days (120), a difference that was not affected by use of the pulmonary artery catheter (121). clinical trials of surfactant replacement have not improved clinical outcomes in ALI and ARDS. some animal studies support the potential efficacy of antiinflammatory therapies for decreasing lung injury. but clinical trials have not demonstrated a convincing reduction in mortality using GM-CSF or glucocorticoids, antioxidants, or anticytokine therapies. allogeneic human MSCs secrete multiple effector molecules, including antiinflammatory cytokines, growth factors, and antimicrobial peptides. these can reverse major abnormalities of lung injury, including altered lung endothelial and epithelial permeability, impaired alveolar edema fluid clearance, dysregulated inflammation, and infection.
