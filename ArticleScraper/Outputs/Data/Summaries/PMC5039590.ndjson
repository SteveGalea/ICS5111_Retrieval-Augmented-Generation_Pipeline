{"summary": "recent studies further indicate a chlamydial aetiology even for patients with spondyloarthritis (SpA). a recent controlled study showed that CReA can be successfully treated with combination antibiotic therapy, thereby raising the possibility of a cure. coinfections involving Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been described often in screening programs and clinical settings. patients with gonorrhoeae also have a concurrent chlamydial infection in less than 1% to a high of 70% of individuals. coinfections with Chlamydiae in Reactive Arthritis and Spondyloarthritis were first described in synovial tissue (ST) and later in patients with chronic ReA and undifferentiated spondyloarthritis (uSpA) the epidemiologic prevalence of infection with C.pn. is significantly higher than that for C.tr. overall. only 12.7% of the samples (n = 217) were positive for C.pn. compared to 28.8% for C.tr. genital infection with C.tr. is responsible for eliciting up to half of all cases of ReA. pulmonary infection with C.pn. is responsible for less than 15% of cases. only 2 patients with uSpA had a history of possible C.tr. infection. PBMC were positive for chlamydial DNA in only 4/26 (15%) patients with uSpA. chlamydial infections are often occult for both organisms. coinfections of C.tr. plus C.pn. were seen in PBMC in 3 and in ST in 2 patients of the 42 included in the trial. a recent case report underlines the efficacy of chlamydial coinfection in ReA. the results of the controlled trial and the case report are promising. lamydial spp., Mycoplasma, and Ureaplasma in patients with post-venereal ReA. the case study of post-venereal ReA (n = 22) assessed the presence of C.tr., C.pn., M.hominis, and U. urealyticum in samples of ST, SF, and PBMC at the time of synovectomy. no intra-articular coinfection of C.tr. and N. gonorrhoeae has been reported. other coinfections of Chlamydiae and arthritogenic bacteria are of some relevance. the simultaneous detection of DNA from C.tr. and B. burgdorferi in the SF of 6 patients with unexplained arthritis. the reductionist approach is inadequate to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms in disease contexts involving complex biofilms. the presence of nonpathogenic organisms or opportunistic pathogens at low levels can attenuate pathogenesis, or it can function with the pathogen(s) to increase damage. 8/23 PCR-positive samples proved to be multiply infected, with organisms from the genera Xanthomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, and others identified in addition to the relevant index organism. we will not address issues relating to or resulting from biofilm formation or infection of normal complex microbiological communities in human. monocytes infected with either chlamydial species plus Mycoplasmae were attenuated in that situation. ae was attenuated in the absence of IFN- the presence of U. parvum attenuated growth. a recent review described studies of respiratory system coinfection with Streptococcus pneumoniae and other common human pathogens. this is of particular interest because the organisms at issue are mucosal pathogens as are C.tr. and C.pn. only one study searched for Chlamydia, Ureaplasma, and Neisseria DNA in SF from patients with inflammatory arthritis with no observation of coinfection. one patient with gonococcal arthritis was diagnosed because of SF-positivity by PCR for Neisseria DNA. a research initiative is needed to investigate patients with undifferentiated arthritis, ReA, and undifferentiated SPA for intra-articular coinfections involving Chlamydiae and urogenital Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. the aim is to confirm the finding mentioned above in post-venereal ReA. it will also be of interest to determine whether other coinfections may be found (e.g., Chlamydia plus enteric bacteria) the Anyplex II STI-7 kit (STI-7, Seegene, Eurobio) has identified coinfections in patients screened for genital infection. commercial assays developed for urogenital samples allow the detection of C.tr. but they do so with a lower sensitivity than do our in-house developed omp1-specific PCR in concert with optimised sample preparation of SF. coinfections may induce more severe inflammation in the arthritic joint during the acute phase of disease. they may prolong the self-limiting phase of the disease, and/or. they may support the chronic disease course because one or several of the coinfecting bacteria are not eliminated. coinfection with C.tr. and U. parvum in an in vitro HeLa cell system treated with IFN- promotes maturation of C.tr. from reticulate bodies to elementary bodies independent of IDO expression. this suggests a novel survival strategy of C.tr. against IFN- exposure, which is of course a critical host defence factor. the reductionist approach of defining details of pathogenesis is no longer adequate for understanding that process in polymicrobial/coinfection contexts. the presence of nonpathogenic organisms or opportunistic pathogens at low levels at an anatomic site with one or more pathogens can attenuate pathogenesis, or it can function with the pathogen(s to increase damage. 8/23 PCR-positive samples proved to be multiply infected, with organisms from the genera Xanthomonas, Stenotrophomonas, Enterobacter, and others identified in addition to the relevant index organism. we will not address issues relating to or resulting from biofilm formation or infection of normal complex microbiological communities in human. a related study of C.pn. and C.tr. infection of human monocytes in culture showed that the host immune response to Chlamydiae was attenuated in that situation. however, the presence of U. parvum attenuated chlamydial growth in host HeLa cells. ioxygenase (IDO) is a requirement for intracellular growth and maturation of C.tr.. presence of the former organism in viable or heat-killed form had no effect on IDO gene expression or enzyme production. iology due to urogenital coinfection of C.tr. and Neisseria gonorrhoeae missing confirmation of intra-articular coinfection. only one study searched for Chlamydia, Ureaplasma, and Neisseria DNA in SF. no commercial test kits are approved for routine application in the rheumatological setting. a research initiative is needed to investigate patients with undifferentiated arthritis, ReA, and undifferentiated SPA for intra-articular coinfections involving Chlamydiae and urogenital Mycoplasma and Ureaplasma spp. the Anyplex II STI-7 kit (STI-7, Seegene, Eurobio) has identified coinfections in patients screened for genital infection. commercial assays developed for urogenital samples allow the detection of C.tr. in clinical specimens, but they do so with a lower sensitivity than do our in-house developed omp1-specific PCR. coinfections may induce more severe inflammation in the arthritic joint. they may prolong the self-limiting phase of the disease, and/or. they may support the chronic disease course because one or several of the coinfecting bacteria are not eliminated. coinfection with C.tr. and U. parvum in an in vitro HeLa cell system treated with IFN- promotes maturation of C.tr. from reticulate bodies to elementary bodies independent of IDO expression. this suggests a novel survival strategy of C.tr. against IFN- exposure, which is of course a critical host defence factor for eliminating Chlamydiae [39] chlamydial infection alone can be effectively eliminated by the combination of azithromycin and rifampin in vitro in HEp-2 cells [63]. further studies are necessary to identify the most effective antimicrobial combination therapy to cure chlamydial arthritis."}
