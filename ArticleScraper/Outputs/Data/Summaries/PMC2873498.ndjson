{"summary": "combination of antigen-specific immunotherapy with the employment of immunomodulatory agents has emerged as a potentially plausible approach for the control of advanced cancer. results We observed that treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod leads to significantly improved antitumor effects and prolonged survival in treated mice. DNA vaccination has become a potentially promising approach for antigen-specific immunotherapy due to its safety, stability and ease of preparation. one of the strategies to enhance DNA vaccine potency uses intracellular targeting strategies to enhance MHC class I antigen presentation and processing in DCs. imiquimod activates immune cells through the toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) on the cell surface. other cell types activated by imiquimod include NK cells, macrophages and B-lymphocytes. treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod leads to increased antitumor effects. TC-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, and 0.4 mg/mL G418 at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. gene gun-mediated intradermal vaccination, 2 g/mouse of recombinant each mouse received topical imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) at the site of the tumor every two days (begun at d6 for a total of 6 treatments) each mouse was vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 2 g via gene gun at d9, d13, and d17. mice were divided into two groups (5/group: vehicle treated or imiquimod treated) each mouse received topical vehicle cream or imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) every two days initiated at d6 for a total of 6 times. each mouse received topical vehicle cream or imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) every two days initiated at d6. mice were inoculated with TC-1 cells (5 104/mouse) s.c. over right leg at d0. each mouse was vaccinated with pcDNA3-CRT/E7 2 g. mice were divided into 4 groups (combined treatments without depletion, combined treatments with depletion of neutrophils, and combined treatments with depletion of macrophages) mice were either undepleted or depleted of macrophages (using clodronate liposomes), NK1.1+ cells (using anti-mouse NK1.1 mAbs, PK136), or neutrophils (using anti-mouse Gr-1 mAbs, RB6-8C TC-1 cells were grown in RPMI 1640, supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum, 50 units/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 2 mmol/L sodium pyruvate, 2 mmol/L nonessential amino acids, and 0.4 mg/mL G418 at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. the TC-1 cells have been tested and shown to be free of mycoplasma and other contamination. each mouse received topical imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) at the site of the tumor every two days. each mouse received topical imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) at the site of the tumor every two days. each mouse received the same treatment schedule as for each monotherapy alone group. mice were divided into two groups (5/group: vehicle treated or imiquimod treated), and were implanted with TC-1 (5 104/mouse) each mouse received topical vehicle cream or imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) every two days initiated at d6 for a total of 6 times. mice were divided into 2 groups (4/group, untreated or imiquimod treated) each mouse received topical imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) at the site of the tumor every two days initiated at d6 for a total of 6 treatments. all mice were implanted with TC-1 (5 104/mouse) at d0. mice were either undepleted or depleted of macrophages. mice were either undepleted or depleted of macrophages. mice were inoculated with TC-1 cells on d0 and treated them with or without topical imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) each mouse received topical imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) each mouse received topical imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) each mouse was vaccinated with 2 g of pcDNA3-CRT/E7 DNA via gene gun at d9, d13, and d17. each mouse received the same treatment schedule as for each monotherapy group. mice treated with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod showed significantly higher numbers of E7-specific CD8+ T cells compared to mice treated with CRT/E7 alone. treatment with imiquimod in combination with DNA vaccination can significantly enhance the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice. mice treated with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod showed significantly lower tumor size over time compared to mice treated with CRT/E7 alone or imiquimod alone. topical treatment with imiquimod in combination with imiquimod can enhance therapeutic antitumor effects against TC-1 tumors in treated mice. treatment with imiquimod leads to increased number of NK1.1+ cells and F4/80+ inflammatory cells in the tumor microenvironment. each mouse received topical vehicle cream or imiquimod every two days initiated at d6 for a total of 6 times. jugated anti-CD4 (L3T4), FITC-conjugated anti-CD8 (53-6.7), FITC-conjugated anti-GR-1 (RB6-8C5), PE-conjugated anti-CD19 (1D3), PE-conjugated anti-NK1.1 (PK136) and PE-Cy5-conjugated anti-F4/80 (BM8) cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis gated on lymph all mice were implanted with TC-1 (5 104/mouse) at d0. all mice were then treated with imiquimod and pcDNA-CRT/E7 2 g. mice were either depleted of macrophages (using clodronate liposomes), NK1.1+ cells (using anti-mouse NK 1.1 mAbs, PK136) or neutrophils (using anti-mouse NK 1.1 m mice treated with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod showed significantly lower numbers of myeloid-derived suppressor cells compared to the other treated mice. treatment with imiquimod in combination with DNA vaccination can reduce the number of myeloid-derived suppressor cells in the tumor microenvironment of treated mice. tumor cells were either stained with PE-conjugated anti-CD4 (L3T4) and FITC-conjugated anti-CD25 (PC61) mAbs (A & B) or with PE-conjugated anti-CD11b (M1/70) and FITC-conjugated anti-Gr-1 (RB6-8C5) mAbs (C & D) treatment with imiquimod in combination with DNA vaccination can significantly enhance the E7-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses in treated mice. all mice were inoculated with TC-1 cells (1 104/mouse) over right leg at d0. mice treated with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod demonstrated significantly lower tumor volume compared to mice treated with CRT/E7 alone or imiquimod alone. topical treatment with imiquimod in combination with therapeutic HPV DNA vaccination can enhance the therapeutic antitumor effects against TC-1 tumors in treated mice. each mouse received topical vehicle cream or imiquimod (50 mg/mouse) every two days initiated at d6 for a total of 6 times. Tumor cells were harvested 6 hours after last imiquimod treatment. mice treated with topical application showed significantly higher number of NK1.1+ cells compared to mice treated with the vehicle. cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis gated on lymphocyte population. NK1.1+ cells play an important role in antitumor effects mediated by treatment with CRT/E7 DNA. all mice were implanted subcutaneously with TC-1 at d0, and were then treated with imiquimod and CRT/E7 DNA vaccine. mice were either depleted of macrophages (using clodronate liposomes), NK1.1+ cells (using anti-mouse NK 1.1 mAbs, PK136) or neutrophils (using anti-mouse Gr-1 mAbs, RB6-8C5), one day before and 3 days after TC-1 implantation. treatment with CRT/E7 DNA in combination with imiquimod also found to lead to an enhancement in the E7-specific s in TC-1 tumor-bearing mice treated with imiquimod and CRT/E7 DNA vaccines led to the loss of antitumor effect. this suggests the importance of macrophages in the antitumor effect generated by imiquimod in combination with the DNA vaccine. treatment with imiquimod leads to increased number of NK1.1+ cells and F4/80+ macrophages in the tumor microenvironment. myeloid-derived suppressor cells play an important immunosuppressive role in the tumor microenvironment of tumor-bearing mice. the reduction in MDSCs may potentially lead to improved antigen-specific CD8+ T cell immune responses, resulting in better tumor killing. the employment of imiquimod for tumor treatment has significant potential for clinical translation. the manuscript was supported by 1 RO1 CA114425 01 and SPORE programs (P50 CA098252."}
