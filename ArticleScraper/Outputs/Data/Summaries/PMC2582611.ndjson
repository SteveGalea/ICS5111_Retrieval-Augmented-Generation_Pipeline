{"summary": "more than 350 gene fusions, as a consequence of chromosome aberrations, have been identified (1). only very limited gene fusion events were discovered in solid tumors, mostly in sarcomas, until the recent discovery of TMPRSS2:ETS fusion genes in prostate cancer (2). several approaches have been used previously for hematological malignancies. these include fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) (2,12,14,17,23), RT\u2013PCR and sequencing (2,7,9,13), quantitative PCR (qPCR) and array-based comparative genome hybridization (10\u201312) tumor samples were purified by Qiagen RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) exon and junction probes are 30-mer oligonucleotides synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA) and printed on poly-l-lysine slides at 50 M along with human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), which is enriched for repetitive sequences. RT\u2013PCR reaction was assembled at 4\u00b0C in a PCR workstation. reverse transcription was performed at 50\u00b0C for 30 min and 95\u00b0C for 15 min. amplicons were purified with DNA Clean-up and Concentrator-5 columns. the amplicons were diluted in water and combined with 3.6 l of 20 SSC, 0.5 l of HEPES and finally 0.5 l of 10% SDS to reach final volume of 25 l. the mixed solution was heated for 2 min at 95\u00b0C, cooled to room temperature and hybridized to the exon mapping arrays at 63\u00b0C overnight essentially as previously described (25\u201327) the other probe at exon 2 of ERG was labeled with 5\u2032-6-carboxyfluorescein (56FAM/GATCTTTTTGGAGACCCGAGCC) the other probe at exon 2 of ERG was labeled with 5\u2032-6-carboxyfluorescein (56FAM/GATCTTTTTGGAGACCCGAGGAAAGACAAATG) conditions were optimized to use a combination of antibodies (1 : 200) obtained from Invitrogen\u2013 esized by Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA) or Illumina/Invitrogen (San Diego, CA, USA) and printed on poly-l-lysine slides at 50 M along with human Cot-1 DNA (Invitrogen), which is enriched for repetitive sequences. the printing procedure follows the manual of the DeRisi arrayer with silicon microcontact printing pins (25\u201327) PCR conditions were 35 cycles at 92\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s and 68\u00b0C for 1.5 min with a final extension step at 68\u00b0C for 5 min. one microliter of unpurified product was subsequently used as a template for another 20 cycles of amplification to label the amplicons via a previously described \u2018Round C\u2019 PCR protocol. the mixed solution was heated for 2 min at 95\u00b0C, cooled to room temperature and hybridized to the exon mapping arrays at 63\u00b0C overnight essentially as previously described (25\u201327). the hybridized arrays were washed and scanned with a GenePix 4000B scanner (Molecular Device, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) conditions were optimized to use a combination of two antibodies (1 : 200) obtained from Invitrogen\u2013Molecular ProbesTM (Qdot 655 * sheep anti-Bio primary antibody conjugate; Qdot 525 * Goat anti-FITC whole IgG primary antibody conjugate). image acquisition was done with a Zeiss Axioplan 2e microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc.) all pictures in the corresponding three channels were deconvolved and optical sections merged probes derived from exons 1\u20133 of the TMPRSS2 and exons 1\u20135 of the TMPRSS2 are labeled and hybridized to an exon array. each selected sequence is represented by two complementary probes (F: forward and R: reverse complement) the total RNA was subjected to RT\u2013PCR with a pair of primers located at exon 6 of TMPRSS2 and exon 4 of TMPRSS2 (2,9) the unpurified product was labeled and hybridized on the microarray. only spots corresponding to exon 1 of TMPRSS2 and exons 4\u20135 of ERG developed strong signals. the detection limit is 32 pg of VCaP RNA in the presence of 100 ng of HeLa RNA. this translates into only 1\u20133 cancer cells in the presence of 3000 times more normal cells. the level of sensitivity is superior to previous methods for detecting fusion transcripts. multiple fusion transcripts in a single prostate cancer sample may reflect tumor heterogeneity or alternative splicing events. redesigned the exon array to include junction probes between exons 1 and 2 of the TMPRSS2 gene and exons 1\u20136 of the ERG gene.

FISH analysis We used FISH analysis to independently confirm our array approach. most of the TMPRSS2:ERG fusion junctions are between exons 1 or 2 of the TMPRSS2 and exons 2\u20135 of the ERG (2,7,9,13) these constraints may be related to whether a functional ERG protein can be made from the gene fusions. PCR products were only generated when there was a gene fusion. exons 1\u20133 of the TMPRSS2 and exons 1\u20135 of the ERG. a probe that spans on the junction of exon 1 and 2 of the TMPRSS2 is labeled as \u20181/2\u2019. the fusion junction is at exon 1 and exon 4 of the TMPRSS2. a prostate cancer cell line, VCaP, (30) with a TMPRSS2 and ERG fusion (2) was used for initial feasibility testing. the total RNA was subjected to RT\u2013PCR with a pair of primers located at exon 6 of ERG and exon 1 of TMPRSS2. only spots corresponding to exon 1 of TMPRSS2 and exons 4\u20135 of ERG developed strong signals. total RNA (5\u201350 ng) from prostate cancers (n = 20) and nonmalignant prostate tissues (n = 10) were subjected to RT\u2013PCR labeling and array hybridization. the results showed that 7/20 cancers but 0/10 nonmalignant samples had TMPRSS2:ERG fusion genes. exon 1 (T1G4) or exon 2 (T2G4) of the TMPRSS2 are weaker than that of the T1G4 junction probe. the signal intensity of the junction probe is weaker than that of the T1G4 junction probe.
