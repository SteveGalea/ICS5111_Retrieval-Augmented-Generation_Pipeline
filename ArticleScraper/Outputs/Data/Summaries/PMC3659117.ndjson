{"summary": "the highly contagious severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) affected individuals in 30 countries in 2002 and 2003 [1]. its causative agent was identified as a novel SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [1], [2], [3] that was initially classified as part of a separate coronavirus group [4], [5], [6], [7], but is now described as a betacoronavirus [8] as with most coronaviruses, despite lacking a significant amino acid sequence homology, SARS-CoV M shares structural and functional similarities with other coronavirus M proteins [27]. despite lacking a significant amino acid sequence homology, SARS-CoV M proteins localize exclusively in the ER/Golgi area [29], [30], [31]. amino acid residues that are important for M self-assembly or secretion are dispersed along the carboxyl-terminal endodomain and the amino-terminal region. results from our tests to determine whether cysteine residues play a role in SARS-CoV VLP assembly indicate that a serine substitution at C63 or C85, or a combined C63/85S double-mutation, did not significantly affect VLP assembly. we found that N coexpression slightly increased wt or secretion-competent M mutant release, but had little effect on the release of secretion-defective mutants. results suggest that C158 is necessary for SARS-CoV M self-assembly or release. at 24 to 36 h post-transfection, supernatants and cells were collected and prepared for protein analysis. medium pellet samples corresponding to 50% of total and cell lysate samples corresponding to 5% of total were fractionated by 10% SDS-PAGE and electroblotted onto nitrocellulose filters. construct Phenotype HA-M, N4Q, 15LL/AA, W19F, W57F, C63S, C85S, W91F, Y94W, F95W VLP assembly-competent W19A, W57A/L, W91A, Y94A, F95A/L, C158S M secretion-competent, but defective in VLP assembly. alanine substitution for F95 significantly impaired VLP assembly. but a tryptophan substitution did not. this indication of an important VLP assembly role for the nearby residues W91 and Y94\u2013two conserved aromatic residues. the dileucine mutation 15LL/AA did not significantly affect M secretion or N packaging. the glycosylated form of M was occasionally detected in medium. this is insufficient evidence to confirm that N-glycan modification makes a significant contribution to M secretion or VLP assembly. our finding of detectable P58A-associated N in medium was likely due to longer immunoblot exposure. phenylalanine replacement for W19, W57 or W91, or tryptophan substitution for Y94 or F95 did not significantly impact VLP assembly. chimeric vesicles contain greater amounts of F95L than of HA-M or HA-M. this is likely evidence of preferential association between HA-M or M-FLAG and immature unglycosylated mutant forms. this is likely evidence of preferential association between HA-M or M-FLAG and immature mutant forms. 293T cells were transfected with the SCoV M wt or indicated mutant plasmid alone or with its FLAG-tagged counterpart. equal amounts of cell lysates were mixed with anti-FLAG affinity gel and incubated for 2 h at 4\u00b0C. bead-bound complexes were pelleted, washed, and subjected to Western immunoblotting. we predicted that in cases where mutants express delayed assembly or budding, medium VLP quantities would increase as incubation time increased. this finding suggests that reductions in M secretion or VLP production are partly due to delays in assembly or budding. however, after 48 h of incubation, N remained barely detectable in medium, or detectable but not equivalent to the level of released M. this finding also suggests that the M mutations may have affected N viral incorporation in addition to impairing M 218LL/AA and M-FLAG were efficiently pulled down by GST-N. similar results were obtained from co-immunoprecipitation experiments using an anti-N antibody. levels of N-associated M-C158S were lower compared to those of other mutants used in this study. cell lysates were subjected to co-immunoprecipitation with anti-N monoclonal antibody. several VLPs were observed localized in perinuclear areas of cells coexpressing wt and mutant M. VLPs were also detectable in cells coexpressing N and secretion-defective W91A. LPs were found in cells coexpressing 218LL/AA plus N. no VLPs were detected during TEM observations of concentrated gradient fractions of cell lysates containing 218LL/AA and N. all other secretion-defective M mutants were still capable of associating with N. secreted mutants carrying the C158S mutation are glycosylated form-deficient. an HA tagged at the M amino-terminus (HA-M) had no major effect on M release and N packaging. a FLAG tagged at the M carboxyl terminus significantly affected N incorporation. codons 15\u201316 and 218\u2013219 are designated as 15LL/AA and 218LL/AA respectively. mutations denote that changing the aromatic residue to Ala or Leu markedly affected M secretion, but replacement with another aromatic residue did not. extracellular particles isolated from 293T culture supernatants expressing SARS-CoV M, M plus N, or HIV-1 Gag were mock-treated or treated with the cysteine-specific cross-linking chemical BMH. samples were subjected to Western immunoblotting following 1 h incubation at room temperature. we failed to detect dimeric or multimeric forms of M in repeat independent experiments. the data suggest that the C63, C85 and C158 residues found in the M dimer are not close enough to be cross-linked by BMH. results from further analysis indicate either the F95L or S110G mutation significantly affected M secretion and VLP production. amino-terminal dileucine motif (L15\u2013L16) and the W19 conserved aromatic residue into alanines. for an additional control we used the N-linked glycosylation blocking mutation N4Q. the dileucine mutation 15LL/AA did not significantly affect M secretion or N packaging. substitution mutations at the M carboxyl tail (218LL/AA) resulted in a statistically insignificant decrease in M secretion. this suggests that the 218LL/AA mutation may impair M-N association. this suggests that the 218LL/AA mutation may impair M-N association. we predicted that secretion-defective mutants associated with wt M would be released into medium. we coexpressed each of the secretion-defective mutants with M-FLAG or HA-M. this suggests some secretion-defective mutants can be rescued into wt M. 293T cells were transfected with the indicated plasmid alone or with a FLAG-tagged or HA-tagged wt M expression vector. at 24\u201336 h post-transfection, cells and medium were harvested and subjected to Western immunoblot analyses. wt or secretion-competent mutants are localized in both perinuclear and plasma membrane areas. the secretion-defective W19A was found in both plasma membrane and perinuclear areas\u2013a staining pattern indistinguishable from that of the wt. this suggests that the M release defect is not completely attributable to a defect in plasma membrane localization. h and 48 h post-transfection, prepared, and subjected to Western immunoblotting. we investigated whether secretion-competent M mutants can still interact with N. the failure of secretion-competent 218LL/AA to form VLPs is due to a defect in N association. 293T cells were cotransfected with GST-N (SARS-CoV N) and N, wt or indicated M mutant plasmid. spherical particles approximately 100 nm in diameter were observed in wt M. VLPs from cells coexpressing N and P58A were undetectable or barely detectable until 48 h post-transfection. at 24 h post-transfection, medium samples containing P58A plus N cotransfectants were almost identical to the mock-transfected sample. 293T cells produce VLP-associated spike (S) proteins at levels 28-fold higher than vero E6 cells. this may partly explain why 293T cells produce VLP-associated spike (S) proteins at levels 28-fold higher than vero E6 cells. dileucine motif 218-LL-219 failed to significantly impact SARS-CoV M-N interaction. this finding agrees with data from yeast two-hybrid and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) assays. dileucine motif 218-LL-219, or a FLAG tagged at the carboxyl-terminus, may block M sorting or trafficking to the Golgi area, resulting in defective VLP formation. aromatic residues have been shown to mediate the self-assembly of different soluble proteins via pi>-pi> interactions. aromatic side chains have been proposed as favoring intra- and inter-peptide electrostatic interaction contributing to protein secondary structure and stable protein-protein interaction. a future task is to determine if the same is true for other aromatic residues. a pair of upstream and downstream primers was used to amplify M-coding fragments via overlap extension mutagenesis.
