{"summary": "thiopyranothiazole scaffold is characterized by \u201cfixed\u201d 4-thiazolidinone biophor in a \u201crigid\u201d condensed system that allows to save the biological activity of their synthetic precursors 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones. thiazolidinones are classified as PAINS (pan assay interference compounds) that are defined by their ability to show activity across a range of assays and towards a range of proteins [10,11] thiopyranothiazoles can be considered bio-mimetics of pharmacologically active 5-ene-4-thiazolidinones without the mentioned Michael acceptors properties. the combination of thiazole and thiopyran cycles in condensed heterosystem is a precondition for the creation of \u201ccenters conservative\u201d of the ligand-target binding complex. 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedithiones contain in their structure,-unsaturated thiocarbonyl fragment similar to the 1-thio-1,3-butadiene. reagents contain in their structure,-unsaturated thiocarbonyl fragment similar to the 1-thio-1,3-butadiene which leads to their high reactivity in the [4+2]-cycloaddition reactions. thionation of 5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinethiones with the Lawesson\u2019s reagent in the xylene medium can result in the formation of thione\u2019s dimers 3, due to the spontaneous [4+2]-cycloaddition reaction of the intermediate 5-arylidene-2,4-thiazolidinedithiones 2 (Scheme 2). thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole cycle causes stereochemistry in hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction. cynnamic acids and their amides, aroylacrylic and arylidene pyruvic acids, propiolic acid and its ethyl ester, acroleine, 2-norbornene and 5-norbornene-2,3-dicarboxylic acid imides as dien the reaction of 5-arylideneisorhodanines with trans-aconitic acid proceeds as a regio- and diastereoselective [4+2]-cycloaddition with spontaneous decarboxylation of the adduct 18. the same products were synthesized using itaconic acid as dienophile. the compounds 5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinethiones with dicyclopentadiene and norbornadiene react in opposite regioselectivity resulting [4+2]-cycloadducts (21). the structure of derivative 24 is predictable (Scheme 7). obtaining compounds 26 in hetero-Diels-Alder reaction of 5-arylidene-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones with bicyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-ene-2,3-dicarboxylic anhydride (endic anhydride) followed by the condensation with triazinelhydrazine in toluene medium and presence of thionyl chloride. terephthalic aldehyde, thio- and isorhodanines were chosen as starting reagents. monoarylidene thiorhodanine 31 and bicyclic arylidene isorhodanine derivatives 32 were prepared in the Knoevenagel condensation. ethyl acrylate and -nitrostyrene were used as dienophiles. [4+2]-cycloaddition of 5-ethoxymethylideneiso- and thiorhodanines with appropriate dienophiles in the toluene medium at room temperature passes as a classical hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction with the formation of 7-ethoxy-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 36,37. aroylacrylic acids and 5-ethoxymethylideneisorhodanine also undergo elimination of ethanol and decarboxylation with regioselective formation of 6-aryl-2-oxo-3,5-dihydro-2H-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazolyl-6-methanones 45. at the same time, interaction with the 1,4-naphthoquinone was accompanied by spontaneous intermediate 5-(cyclo)alkylideneisorhodanines with arylmaleinamides, 2-norbornene and (3,5-dioxo-4-azatricyclo[5.2.1.02,6]decen-8-yl-4)-acetic acid [36] yielded low molecular thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 50\u201352 [41]. thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles dienophile component represented by maleic acid and its derivatives (maleic anhydride, maleinimides) and acrylic acid and its derivatives (methyl acrylate, ethyl acrylate, acrylonitrile), thus allowing to obtain compounds 4\u20137 (Scheme 3). thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 8\u201315 are promising biologically active compounds based on the \u201cthiazolidinone\u201d matrix (Scheme 4). chiral centers in the structure of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole cycle causes certain features of stereochemistry in the hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction. the reaction of 5-arylideneisorhodanines with trans-aconitic acid proceeds as a regio- and diastereoselective [4+2]-cycloaddition with spontaneous decarboxylation of the adduct 18. the same products were synthesized using itaconic acid as dienophile. thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles 22 undergo spontaneous oxidation. the compounds 5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinethiones with dicyclopentadiene and norbornadiene react in a similar manner as norbornene derivatives. hydride in DMF medium at 110 \u00b0C firstly and then reaction of 4-(4,6-dichloro-1,3,5-triazin-2-ylamino)-4-azatricyclo[5.2.1.02,6]dec-8-ene-3,5-dione 27 with 5-arylidene-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones yielding [4+2]-cycloaddition products 28 [36]. the synthesis of 1,4-bis(thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazolyl)benzene derivatives enabled syntheses of the compounds 33\u201335 (Scheme 11). the synthesis of 1,4-bis(thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazolyl)benzene derivatives. polycyclic heterosystems 42,43 and 42,43 are observed in the medium of acetic acid. acetic acid and acrolein, crotonic aldehyde, 2-norbornene, 5-norbornene and 5-norbornene imides were observed in the medium of acetic acid that allowed obtaining heterocyclic aldehydes. the 1,4-naphthoquinone was accompanied by spontaneous intermediate dehydrogenation with the formation of additional endocyclic double bond. the ethanol molecule yielded 5,10-dihydro-2H-benzo[6,7]thiochromeno[2,3-d][1,3]thiazole-2,5,10-trione 46. the initial heterodienes 47 were obtained in the reaction of isorhodanine. alkylideneisorhodanine motif in synthesis of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles. the reaction of isorhodanine with 2-(furan-2-yl)-methylenemalonitrile yields thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-6-carbonitrile 54 (X=S) pyrano[2,3-d]thiazole 54 (X=O) is formed. bicyclic 5-arylideneiso(thio)rhodanines 56 with malonodinitrile bis-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivative 58 was synthesized in the reaction of 1,4-bis-(2,2\u2032-dicyanovinyl)-benzene 57 with two equivalents of isorhodanine. in the second case, formation of the derivative 58 occured as two-stage process including an initial synthesis of polycondensed Thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives. tandem and \u201cdomino\u201d reactions products have drug-like structure. most of the tandem and \u201cdomino\u201d reactions products have drug-like structure. mentioned reaction is a two-step process involving combination of hetero diene synthesis and acylation of phenolic group. the first example of tandem hetero-Diels-Alder reaction for the 5-arylidene-4-thiazolidinethiones. hetero-Diels\u2013Alder-acylation tandem reactions of 5-(2-hydroxyphenylmethylidene)isorhodanines 64 with unsaturated carboxylic acids and their derivatives were formed. a racemic mixture of rel-(5R,5aR,11bS)-2,6-dioxo-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno was formed. thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-2,6-diones 68 were the products of tandem hetero-Diels\u2013Alder-acylation reaction of 5-(2-hydroxyphenylmetylidene)isorhodanines and cynnamic acids. the reaction of 67 with primary amines in acetic acid passed through the amidation stage. the reaction of 2-hydroxyphenylmethylidene)isorhodanines with 2(5H)furanone proceeded as a diastereoselective tandem acylation-hetero-Diels-Alder reaction providing novel rel-(5R,5aR,11bS)-5-hydroxymethyl-3,5,5a,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5]thio novel rel-(5aR,6R,11bS)-6-hydroxy-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno[2,3-d]thiazole-2-ones 74 [51]. a domino reaction involves two or more transformations, which result in the formation of bonds (usually C\u2013C bonds) proposed a probable mechanism of this reaction through the exo-selective cyclization of the 5-arylidene intermediate in hetero-Diels-Alder reaction. the formation of endo-intermediate is a minor process. isorhodanine interacts with structural analogs of 2-allyloxybenzaldehyde-2-(2-methylallyloxy)- and 2-(cyclohexene-2-yloxy)benzaldehydes, 2-allyloxynaphthalaldehyde as well as 2-formylphenyl-(E)-3-aryl-2-propenoates. stereochemistry of final compounds depends on endo- and exo-orientation of the dien ethyl (2E)-4-(2-formylphenoxy)but-2-enoate and 4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinone affords intermediate 90 for intramolecular hetero-Diels\u2013Alder cycloaddition. cycloaddition provides diastereoselective formation of ethyl rel-(5aR,5R,11bR)-2-oxo-2,3,5,5a,6,11 thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles reaction is a two-step process involving combination of hetero diene synthesis and acylation of phenolic group. I.D. Komaritsa [18] and N.A. Kassab [20] had used 5-(2-hydroxyphenylmethylidene)-isorhodanine in the reactions with acrylic acid. acylation- and hemiacetal-based reactions can be distinguished. the first approach requires the use of derivatives of,-unsaturated carboxylic acids as dienophiles. a racemic mixture of rel-(5R,5aR,11bS)-2,6-dioxo-3,5a,6,11b-tetrahydro-2H,5H-chromeno [4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5] thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-5-carboxylic acids derivatives 66 with a cis-Hydrogen in positions 5, 5 and 11 of heterocyclic systems was formed hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction takes place to form thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivative 70. presence of a double bond at positions 5\u20136 causes planar structure of bicyclic fragment. the reactions between 5-(2-hydroxybenzylidene)-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones and arylidene pyruvic acids yielded the mixture of rel-(5S,5aR,11bR) 73 and rel-(5R,5aS,11bR) 73* diastereisomers at 2:1 ratio. thiopyranothiazole scaffold synthesis is obtaining of series of chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-2-(thi)ones 76,77 and isothiochromeno[4a,4-d]thiazole-2-ones 75 in the domino Knoevenagel-hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction. isothiochromeno[4a,4-d]thiazole-2-one 75 was alkylated by chloroacetamides, bromoacetophenones to give the derivatives 83,84. cyanoethylation reaction resulted in propionitryl 85 formation. derivatives 68 obtained in tandem acylation-hetero-Diels\u2013Alder reaction. stereochemistry of final compounds depends on the endo- and exo-orientation of the dienophile in transition state. the presence of allyl moiety in the molecule induces exo-transition state. isorhodanine with 2-(2-propynoxy)benzaldehyde in the medium of acetic acid did not stop on the formation of expected 3,11b-dihydro-2H,6H-chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-2-one 92. the latter underwent spontaneous oxidation yielding 6H-chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5]thiopyran 6-carboxymethyl-7-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-oxo-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-6-carboxylic acid potassium salt 94. a similar activity level was established for the rel-(5R,6S,7S)-[5-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-7-(4-methoxyphenyl)-2 ano[2,3-d]thiazoles 97,98 showed inhibition activity against influenza virus type A H3N2 and H5N1. 7-Aryl-2-oxo-3,5,6,7-tetrahydro-2H-thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-6-carbaldehydes possesed promising influence on EBV virus. study of a series of 5-(2-thienyl)methylene-4-thioxo-2-thiazolidinones resulted in identifying of potent active compound 6-carboxy-7-(2-thienyl)-tetrahydrothiopyrano-7H-[2,3-d]thiazole 104. besides antimicrobial (against B. Subtilis) and antituberculous activities high antifungal potential. chromeno[4\u2032,3\u2032:4,5]thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles and isothiochromeno[3,4-d]thiazoles with anticancer activity in vitro. the most active were compounds with the ester-106, N-trifluoromethylphenyl- and 3,4-dichlorophenyl-acetamide fragments (107,108) in the molecules that were characterized by the cytostatic effects against thopyranothiazole systems of type 111 with 4-benzyloxy-3-methoxyphenyl- and 5-(2,5-dichlorophenyl)-furan-2-yl substituents in the 9th position of the main core inhibited cancer cell growth at submicromolar concentrations. tetradecen-4(8)-one-6 112 being moderately active towards a panel of cancer cell lines showed rather good growth inhibition against leukemia cell lines thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole-6-carbaldehyde 116 showed high level of antimitotic activity against leukemia with mean GI50/TGI values 1.26/25.22 M [31] thiazolidinone derivative investigations are the search for potent anti-parasitic agents, namely compounds exhibiting antitrypanosomal activity. thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazole derivatives can be investigated as potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents. some structure-activity relationships of thiopyrano[2,3-d]thiazoles are outlined in Figure 9."}
