{"summary": "EBOV is an emerging zoonotic pathogen that causes hemorrhagic fever in humans. it is classified as a category A pathogen (2) and is studied under biosafety level 4 containment. it is not lethal in experimentally infected mice or guinea pigs. EBOV particles undergo endocytosis (8), likely through macropinocytosis. internalized virus localizes to acidified endosomes containing activated cysteine proteases cathepsins L (Cat L) and B (Cat B), generating a primed species competent for entry. EBOV VLPs bearing an F88A mutant GP (GP-F88A) could enter mouse peritoneal macrophages and bone-marrow-derived dendritic-cell antigen-presenting cells. mutating other hydrophobic residues impaired entry, but not in a mouse APC-specific manner. guinea pig colonic adenocarcinoma cell line GPc16; guinea pig colonic adenocarcinoma cell line GPc16; guinea pig colonic adenocarcinoma cell line GPc16. mouse macrophage cell lines RAW 264.7, H36.12a (ATCC CRL-2445), J774, and IC-21 (ATCC TIB-186) were grown in the -lactamase VP40 expression plasmid was transfected on its own (18 g) or in combination (12 g) with plasmids expressing GP-wt or VSV G (6 g) cells and cellular debris were pelleted away from the harvested VLP-containing supernatant by gentle centrifugation at 175 g. the -lactamase equivalents of different VLP preparations were used in each entry assay. 5,000 cells were sorted per sample for entry assays using cell lines. 50,000 cells were sorted per sample for entry assays using cell lines. Western blots were incubated for 1 h at 4\u00b0C, washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline. -lactamase equivalents of purified VLPs were separated by SDS-PAGE. Immature DCs were differentiated with 500 U/ml human granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and 500 U/ml human interleukin-4 (IL-4) (Peprotech, Rocky Hill, NJ) by day 5, immature DCs expressed surface CD11c and HLA-DR (major histocompatibility complex class II [MHC-II]) EBOV GP-mediated entry efficiency was not affected when PECs were used 1-day postharvesting rather than the same day. specific CD11b+ or CD34+ cells were isolated using beads and columns with products suggested by the manufacturer. VSV-GP-EBOV particles were incubated with thermolysin (200 g/ml) for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. the protease was inactivated by addition of phosphoramidon (1 mM) the reaction mixtures were used immediately. the GP concentrations of different viral preparations were pretitrated for the GP-NPC1 binding assay in a separate GP ELISA. infectivities of VSV pseudotypes were measured by manual counting of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-positive cells. cell counts were corrected for viral dilution to generate infectious titers. in threshold cycle (CT) method using the -actin gene to normalize the results. a mouse monoclonal anti-EBOV (-EBOV) mucin domain antibody was detected using 9c11 (44), a mouse monoclonal anti-EBOV (-EBOV) mucin domain antibody. plasmids were pCAGGS -lactamase-VP40 and a pcDNA plasmid expressing wild-type mayinga GP (GP-wt), GP-derived mutants, or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV G) the plasmids were transfected on its own (18 g) or in combination (12 g) with plasmids expressing GP-wt or VSV G VLP preparations were normalized based on -lactamase activity. the -lactamase equivalents of different VLP preparations were used in each entry assay. the entry of VLPs into cells was assayed by flow cytometry. -lactamase equivalents of purified VLPs were separated by SDS-PAGE. Western blots were developed using a Western Lightning ECL kit. anti-human CD14 antibody-labeled magnetic beads and iron-based Midimacs LS columns were purified using anti-human CD14 antibody-labeled magnetic beads and iron-based midimacs LS columns. the cells were plated (0.7 106 to 1 106 cells/ml) in DC medium (RPMI), supplemented with 100 units/ml of penicillin. to harvest granulocytes and macrophages, the mice were induced overnight or for 24 h with intraperitoneally inoculated 3% thioglycolate solution. to harvest PECs, 2 ml of Hanks' balanced salt solution was introduced through a small abdominal incision into the peritoneum of the mouse, the abdomen was massaged and the solution containing the PECs was harvested. Flow cytometry was performed using an LSR II flow cytometer equipped with a violet laser. day 5 to 7 human DCs were plated in 24-well dishes. ified, Flag-tagged proteins were detected with anti-Flag antibody-horseradish peroxidase conjugate and Ultra-TMB substrate. binding curves were fitted to a logistic equation (Graphpad Prism) to derive the 50% effective concentration (EC50), the NPC1 domain C concentration at which half-maximal binding to GP is obtained. EBOV VLPs were generated by expressing an EBOV VP40 matrix protein fused at its N terminus to -lactamase. this fusion was coexpressed with either wild-type or mutant EBOV GP or control VSV G, resulting in the incorporation of the glycoproteins into the VLPs (41). human DCs infected with GP-wt VLPs were positive for cytoplasmic -lactamase activity (blue fluorescing) after 3.5 h, human DCs infected with GP-wt VLPs were positive for cytoplasmic -lactamase activity (blue fluorescing) GP-F88A VLPs were unable to enter human DCs. entry assays demonstrating GP-F88A-mediated entry into human DCs were repeated 10 times with similar results. no Tx, no transfection. F88A entry into mouse PEMs occurs via macropinocytosis and requires an intact fusion peptide. PEMs were preincubated for 30 min with 2-fold dilutions of EIPA. each point on the graphs represents a single entry assay. PECs consist of a mixed population of mostly B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, and macrophages. cells were analyzed for entry using GP-wt and GP-F88A VLPs. the percentage of cells that were entry positive was shown to be 2.81% (404 cells out of 14,390 total cells) infection by VLPs lacking a surface viral glycoprotein was compared with infection by the VSV G, GP-wt, and GP-F88A VLPs. entry was shown to be dependent on the presence of a viral glycoprotein. -lactamase equivalents of VLPs made by expressing -lactamase-VP40 did not enter any cell tested. GP-wt (GP) and GP-F88A (88) VLPs were used to infect PEMs (C) and vero 76 cells (D) for comparisons, VLPs were adjusted to equal infectivity. each point in panels C and D represents a single entry assay. the large majority of PEMs are permissive for both GP-wt- and GP-F88A-mediated entry. no entry into vero cells was detected at any of the tested concentrations of GP-F88A VLPs. residue 88 of Zaire EBOV GP is partly exposed at the surface of the GP and is adjacent to hydrophobic amino acid residues L111, I113, L122 and F225. shown in Fig. 4A are the levels of entry by GP-wt and GP-F88A. the average percent entry into each cell type is provided. GP-F88A also entered the guinea pig GPc16 cells, albeit inefficiently. the EBOV GP trimeric ectodomain lacking the GP mucin domain. the membrane-proximal portion of GP is at the bottom. the ectodomain is thought to play a role in receptor binding. lacVP40 plus GP, lacVP40 plus GP-F88A, lacVP40 plus GP-L111A, lacVP40 plus GP-I113A, lacVP40 plus GP-I113A, lacVP40 plus GPL122A, and lacVP40 plus GP-F225A VLPs. only modest differences in the levels of GP-F88A, GP-L111A, GP-I113A, and GP-L122A incorporation both GP-wt and GP-F88A VLPs were sensitive to EIPA. inhibition was seen at concentrations at which VSV G-dependent entry was intact. only at higher concentrations of EIPA was VSV G-mediated entry inhibited. GPCL-wt showed moderately reduced binding to human NPC1 domain C. both GPCL-wt and GPCL-F88A bound less efficiently to mouse NPC1 domain C than to the human protein. the F88A mutation had only a modest impact on GP-NPC1 binding. the ratios represent 4 to 6 trials from at least two independent experiments. mouse macrophage IC-21 cells are susceptible to entry with GP-F88A VLPs and permit infection with GP-F88A-pseudotyped VSV. GP-wt and GP-F88A VLPs were tested for entry into IC-21 cells. levels of murine NPC1 mRNA were assayed from RAW and IC-21 cells. after 16 h at 37\u00b0C, infection was scored by manual counting of EGFP-positive cells. EBOV VLPs were generated by expressing an EBOV VP40 matrix protein fused at its N terminus to -lactamase. this fusion was coexpressed with either wild-type or mutant EBOV GP or control VSV G. to assay for successful entry, target cells were loaded with a membrane-permeable -lactamase substrate. human DCs derived from monocytes isolated from different donors consistently resulted in significant entry by GP-wt. entry by GP-F88A never rose above 10%. GP-wt is permissive for entry into mouse peritoneal cells, but not human dendritic cells. GP-F88A, GP-L111A, GP-I113A, GP-L122A, GP-F159A, and GP-F225A VLPs were generated and tested in entry assays. as a negative control, GP-F159A VLPs were also generated. a subpopulation of mouse PECs could be infected by VLPs possessing either GP-wt or GP-F88A. entry was inhibited by the pancysteine protease inhibitor E64d. entry positive was shown to be 2.81% (404 cells out of 14,390 total cells) entry-positive cells were relatively large (data not shown), suggesting they were macrophages and not lymphocytes. the experiment was repeated, but PECs were stained with representative stains for T lymphocytes (anti-CD3) and myeloid cells, including macrophages (anti-CD11b) the presence of a viral glycoprotein did not enter any cell tested. GP-wt and GP-F88A VLPs mediate entry into mouse antigen-presenting cells. peritoneal cells were stained with anti-CD3 and anti-CD11b antibodies. all infected PECs were CD11b+ (PEMs), not all PEMs were infected. increasing concentrations of GP-wt and GP-F88A VLPs were used to infect PEMs. despite this difference, increasing PEM infection occurred with increasing concentrations of either GP-wt or GP-F88A-mediated entry. mutating other residues to alanine would reveal entry phenotypes similar to that of GP-F88A in human cells, murine cells, or other cell types potentially relevant to EBOV infection. GP-wt, GP-F88A, GP-L111A, GP-I113A, GP-L122A, and GP-F225A VLPs were also generated, because residue 159 does not localize near F88. GP-F88A showed reduced entry, relative to GP-wt, into mouse BM-DCs. GP-L111A entry was seen in murine DCs, human DCs, and vero cells. GP-L122A VLPs infected mouse DCs, as well as vero and GPc16 cells. GP-F159A mutant failed to enter any of the cell types (43, 49, 54) Residue 88 of Zaire EBOV GP is partly exposed at the surface of the GP. is located near several other hydrophobic residues, including L111, I113, L122, and F225. GP-wt and GP-F88A mutants were sensitive to EIPA. inhibition was seen at concentrations at which VSV G-mediated entry was intact. sensitivity of entry by GP-wt and GP-F88A was assessed. mutating GP residue 535, whether by itself or in combination with F88A, ablated entry into PEMs and human DCs. EBOV GP-mediated entry into PEMs, like entry into other cell types, requires the viral fusion machinery (17). overexpression of GP-F88A was recently demonstrated to rescue entry of GP-F88A. EC50 values for binding of GPCL-wt and GPCL-F88A to human and mouse NPC1 domain C are provided in Table 2. a GP-wt human 0.4 0.1 Murine 2 1 GP-F88A human 5 1 Murine 3 2 Open in a. mouse macrophage IC-21 cells are susceptible to entry by GP-F88A VLPs. they permit infection with GP-F88A-pseudotyped VSV. we compared GP-wt and GP-F88A VLP-mediated entry using murine fibroblast NIH 3T3 cells. of these, only the IC-21 cells were permissive for GP-F88A-mediated entry. the asterisk denotes the limit of detection in the experiment. we assessed the relative levels of murine NPC1 by qRT-PCR in NIH 3T3, J774, RAW 264.7, H36.12a, and IC-21 cells and PEMs. EBOV targets APCs, such as macrophages, for infection. the same mouse APCs permissive for GP-wt entry are also permissive for entry by GP-F88A. the basis for GP-F88A restriction in primate cells remains incompletely defined. GP-F88A has been shown to be susceptible to both thermolysin (49) and cathepsin B or L cleavage (43), similar to wild-type GP. this suggests that the defect in GP-F88A entry into primate cells is not at the level of VLP incorporation or GP processing. GP-F88A-mediated entry into mouse PEMs resembles GP-wt entry into either mouse or human cells. phenotype of the GP-F88A mutant differs from that displayed by mutants at the other nearby hydrophobic residues, L111, I113, L122, and F225. mutations incorporated to similar levels into purified VLPs, but not species-specific. cells that lack caveolae can still be infected with EBOV (47), and recent studies support macropinocytosis. GP-F88A- and GP-wt-mediated entry into PEMs can be inhibited by EIPA in a dose-dependent manner. GP-F88A- and GP-wt-mediated entry into PEMs can be inhibited by EIPA in a dose-dependent manner. GPCL-F88A bound to mouse NPC1 domain C with similar efficiencies. findings suggest that the retention of mouse NPC1 binding to GPCL-F88A contributes to the capacity of GP-F88A to infect mouse, but not human, dendritic cells. not all mouse cells that permit GP-wt entry also permit GP-F88A entry."}
