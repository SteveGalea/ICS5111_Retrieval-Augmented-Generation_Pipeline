{"summary": "frontline HCWs were defined as those who worked >1 shift per week and had likely exposure to patients with pandemic influenza infection. staff members who had no clinical contact were chosen as a convenient surrogate for a community control group. an initial serum sample was obtained from all participants to measure for pandemic influenza antibodies. participants were asked about work exposure to patients with suspected pandemic influenza. participants were also asked about use of neuraminidase inhibitors. Statistical Analysis On the basis of early estimates of antibody positivity to pandemic influenza virus in the community, we assumed 20% infection rates in clinical staff and 10% rates in nonclinical staff. primary outcome was the presence of a positive antibody titer in the first serum sample, indicating likely pandemic influenza infection. the study took place from august 24, 2009, through December 16, 2009, largely before release of the pandemic influenza vaccine. no participant was vaccinated during the study. Table 1 shows the number of patients who confirmed pandemic influenza infection (by PCR) and were treated in each of the hospitals. 79 (17.7%) of 446 showed evidence of infection on the basis of a positive antibody titer of >40, 46 (19.9%) of 231 in the clinical group, and 33 (15.3%) of 215 in the nonclinical group. median participant age was 38 years (range 18\u201374 years); 27% were 30 years of age, 20% were 30\u201339 years of age, 25% were 40\u201349 years of age. adjustmented odds ratios are shown in Table 3. Table 3. Factors associated with positive titer for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in HCWs at 4 hospitals, Australia, August 24\u2013December 16, 2009*. serology and Swab test results Of the 395 participants, 140 (35%) reported a respiratory illness and 46 had nose swabs taken. seven were positive for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus by PCR, 1 for subtype H3N2 influenza, and 38 were negative. one of the 46 had 2 swabs taken during different illnesses; the first was positive and the second was negative for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. four of the 7 participants with a positive PCR result and the 1 in whom seroconversion occurred were in the clinical group (3 doctors, 1 pharmacist, 1 nurse, 1 physiotherapist) participants with a positive PCR result ranged from 24\u201363 years of age. five of the participants with positive PCR results and the participant in whom seroconversion occurred had received the 2009 and previous seasonal influenza vaccines. for 87 participants, a second serum sample was taken because of a reported respiratory illness. the average number of days between the first and second sample was 60 days. thirty-six participants who had nose swabs performed also had a second serum sample taken. seroconversion occurred in only 1/87 workers, with an initial titer of 10 and a subsequent titer of 40 (76 days later). this participant had a nose swab taken during a respiratory infection no participant reported having laboratory-confirmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza. six reported community contact with someone who had laboratory-confirmed infection. one reported taking oseltamivir after contact with an infected person. a prelicensure study excluded subjects with confirmed or suspected pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza (15) this difference in titers may have reflected geographic differences in infection rates. we did not observe higher levels of preexisting antibodies against pandemic (H1N1) 2009 influenza with increasing age, which has previously been reported. this finding confirms the great importance of PPE in preventing transmission of respiratory viruses in the health care setting. the risk for pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection increased with the number of children 18 years of age living in the participant\u2019s household. the median age of persons with reported pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus infection was 15 years, with 67% of all notified case-patients being 5\u201317 years of age (1). none of the participants with positive PCR results reported taking NIs, and all had serum samples taken >2 weeks after the positive nose swab specimen. seroconversion occurs in 80%\u201390% of serum samples if they are tested a sufficient time after infection (confirmed by RT-PCR). this study relied on self-reported symptoms and risk factors, including use of PPE, making it subject to recall bias. many of the predictor variables were not subject to recall bias. however, many of the predictor variables were not subject to recall bias."}
