{"summary": "study aimed to describe GE and RTI outbreaks with infection and all-cause lethality rates according to individual characteristics of nursing home residents. 61 GE outbreaks and 76 RTI oubreaks (total 137 outbreaks) were recorded involving respectively 4309 and 5862 residents. 86 years, 1.97 (1.19\u20133.25) and ORautonomy adjusted for age for the more autonomous group. flu+, 0.41 (0.24\u20130.69) and Flu-, 0.42 (0.20, 0.90) residents of nursing homes are increasingly elderly and dependent. specific infection and lethality risks according to these two factors indicate surveillance and infection control measures are essential. outbreak inclusion depended on institutional alert to the hygiene team. a practitioner from the hygiene team collected the information and evaluated the clinical signs, the virology information and the epidemiological context with the physician in the affected unit. autonomy is classified into 6 Iso-Resource Groups (GIR) with the AGGIR scale, autonomy is classified into 6 Iso-Resource Groups. GIR 1 (bedridden or armchair-bound persons, mental functions seriously altered and requiring continuous presence), GIR 2 (preserved mental autonomy with partially preserved motor autonomy and assistance several times a day. ii) influenza-like illness (both the following criteria must be met: fever AND at least three other symptoms (chills, new headache or eye pain, myalgia or body aches, malaise or loss of appetite, sore throat, new or increased dry cough) and lower respiratory tract infection (both of the following criteria must be met) the practitioner from the hygiene team obtained clinical information from the patient\u2019s health care records. virological investigation Testing for the virus was not systematic and was decided by the physicians in each institution in presence of clinical signs. for GE, stool samples were sent to the National Reference Centre for Gastroenteritis Viruses in Dijon for laboratory testing, as previously described. flu and noV contexts did not eliminate other potential enteric or respiratory pathogens. data analysis Sex, age, length of stay (LOS, in years) and autonomy status were described. the all-cause lethality rate per 7-day interval was calculated. the average rate of residents discharged per 7-day period was calculated. the average rate of residents discharged per 7-day period was calculated. chi-square or Fisher exact tests were used to compare infection and lethality rates according to the studied parameters. the odds ratio was calculated by median-unbiased estimation. a practitioner from the hygiene team collected the information and evaluated the clinical signs, the virology information and the epidemiological context. the detected cluster was only put under surveillance if the hygiene team considered there was a potential outbreak phenomenon. clusters with at least 3 cases within a period of seven days in one unit could be recorded if they were reported to the hygiene team. mental functions not totally altered and requiring assistance in most activities of daily living. GIR 3 (preserved mental autonomy with partially preserved motor autonomy), GIR 4 (moves around the home and sometimes assistance for washing, dressing, physical activities or eating), GIR 6 (autonomy for essential tasks of daily living) influenza vaccination status and oseltamivir prescriptions were recorded. at least two respiratory signs or symptoms (new or increased cough, new/increased sputum production, O2 saturation 94% or reduced >3% from baseline, abnormal lung examination (new or changed), pleuritic chest pain, respiratory rate 25 breaths/min AND one or more constitutional signs/symptoms (fever, leukocytosis, confusion, acute functional decline) rapid immunoassay diagnosis tests used for influenza detection were: Clearview\u00ae Exact Influenza A and B (Inverness Medical, Cologne, Germany) from 2007 to 2014 and InfluenzaTop\u00ae (Alldiag, Strasbourg, France) from 2014 to 2018. most testing targeted the norovirus (NoV) and influenza virus, but other tests were occasionally performed by the national reference centre for influenza Viruses. the two most dependent categories (GIR 2) were grouped together and compared with the more autonomous categories (GIR 3). influenza outbreak epidemiological contexts were used with the four categories: noV+, Flu+, NoV- and flu-. the serial interval in days (SId) was the time period between the onset of symptoms of the last case in initial outbreak (N) and the onset of symptoms of the first case in the following outbreak (N+1) investigations were performed when SId was shorter or equal to the length of the previous D1 to 56. the Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare median values. 7643 of the exposed residents were women and 2528 were men. the median age was 86.7 years old. for GE outbreaks, 2524 residents were in a NoV+ context versus 1785 in a NoV- context, and for GE outbreaks, 3479 residents were in a Flu+ context versus 2383 in a Flu- context. the infection rate was higher in the noV+ context (43.3%) than in the noV- context (32.7%, (odds ratio (OR): 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.56\u20130.72), p adjusted analysis revealed specific significant effect modification according to sex (NoV+) and LOS (NoV-) (S6 Table) in analyses stratified according to virus and sex, age adjusted for LOS remained significant for flu+ and noV+ outbreaks (males) + Flu+ 4 86 40.3 (278) 0.03 25.9 (355) 0.001 86 51.6 (161) 1.57 (1.06\u20132.33) 36.4 (231) 1.63 (1.14\u20132.34) 4 86 27.6 (127) 0.12 24.3 (206) 0.02 86 41.3 (46) 1.84 (0.90\u20133.74) 38.8 (85) 1.98 (1.15\u20133.40) Homogeneity test - - - - 0.70 - - 0.97 (0.64\u20131.47) 4 86 18.1 (94) 0.02 26.6 (113) 0.20 86 40.6 (32) 3.07 (1.25\u20137.49) 39.5 (38) 1.80 (0.82\u20133.91) Odds Ratio - - 1.28 (0.82\u20131.97) 0.32 - 1.1 (0.78\u20131.61) 0.60 Homogeneity test - - - 0.02 - - 0.16 MH adj. significant differences appeared after .35\u20134.32) 2.1(1042, 2) 0.85 (0.48\u20131.51) 4 0.3 (1079, 0) 0.62 (0.12\u20132.63) 1.8 (1019, 1) 0.71 (0.38\u20131.30) 5 0.3 (1076, 0) 0.62 (0.12\u20132.64) 0.9 (1000, 1) 0.36 (0.16\u20130.75) 6 0.9 (1072, 1) 2.02 (0.70\u20136.65) 0.5 (990, 1) 0.21 (0.07\u20130.50) 44 of the 137 outbreaks (32.12%) were identified. 194 of 3499 exposed and infected residents contracted multiple infections. the percentage of exposed and infected residents implicated in more than one virus stratification was 11.09% ((194*2)/3499) all infected residents (length stay median = 2.3 years, 95% CI: 2.2\u20132.4) was 0.41% per 7-day period. average weekly rate of discharged residents was equal to: [10/3499/8]*100 = 0.035% or 0.14% for the four 7-day intervals. lethality in the noV+ context was lower than the three other levels. ORautonomy adjusted for age were for GIR 3\u20136 (compared with GIR 1\u20132): Flu+, 0.41 (0.24\u20130.69); Flu-, 0.42 (0.20, 0.90) lethality rates with 3-level stratification (virus, age, autonomy) in outbreaks according to individual characteristics.
