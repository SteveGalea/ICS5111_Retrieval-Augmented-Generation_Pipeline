{"summary": "osteoarthritis is a chronic joint disease characterized by a progressive degradation of articular cartilage, synovial inflammation and remodeling of subchondral bone. the catabolic phenotype observed in osteoarthritis is caused by an imbalance in synthesis and degradation of matrix components. there is now general agreement that osteoarthritis involves all structures in the affected joint, which leads to articular cartilage deterioration. 14-3-3 is upregulated in medium from compressed or uncompressed osteoblasts or osteocytes. 14-3-3 was released by human osteoarthritis subchondral bone. the proteins were first identified by Moor and Perez in 1968. 14-3-3 is abundantly secreted by differentiated keratinocytes. it can induce the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3 and MMP-8. no receptor for 14-3-3 has been identified in articular cartilage. soluble form of CD13 acts as a T-cell chemoattractant that induces rheumatoid arthritis synovitis. this interaction between 14-3-3 and CD13 leads to a chondrocyte catabolic phenotype similar to that observed in osteoarthritis. chondrocytes CD13 expression was first examined in primary cultures of mouse chondrocytes. mRNA expression of CD13 was demonstrated in murine chondrocytes. the peak of expression was between 24 and 26 cycles. mouse chondrocytes transfected with siRNA1 or siRNA2 against CD13 showed significantly decreased expression of CD13 expression at the mRNA level. treatment with 1 g/ml 14-3-3 increased the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-3 by tenfold as compared with the control. murine articular chondrocytes were transfected for 48 h with small interfering (siRNA) targeting the CD13 gene or with negative control AllStars. the cells were then starved and stimulated with recombinant 14-3-3 (1 g/ml) for 24 h. mouse chondrocytes were stimulated with 14-3-3 with or without APNi. the dose-dependent inhibitory effect of APNi on enzymatic activity was not modified by 14-3-3. ar chondrocytes were starved, pretreated with APNi (0.1 and 1 mM), then stimulated with 14-3-3 (1 g/ml) after 24 h, cells were incubated with L-alanine -naphthylamide (50 M) for 60 min. the blocking antibody alone has no effect on mouse MMP-3 and MMP-13 gene expression. primary cultures of articular chondrocytes from newborn mice were starved. then stimulated with 1 g/ml recombinant 14-3-3 in presence of an anti-CD13 blocking antibody. release were significantly decreased by 43% and 59% respectively. treatment with an antibody that blocks only the receptor role of CD13 greatly inhibits the 14-3-3-mediated mRNA and protein expression of both MMP-3 and MMP-13 in murine and human chondrocytes. results suggest that CD13 interacts directly with extracellular 14-3-3 to transmit its signal in chondrocytes. binding of recombinant human 14-3-3 (red, 10 M), human anti-CD13 antibody SJ1D1 (blue, 1 g/ml) and isotype IgG1 control (green, 1 g/ml) on recombinant human CD13 immobilized on the sensor chip. the differential response was obtained by subtracting the signal in the blank channel from that in the experimental channel. mouse chondrocytes were treated with biotin\u201314-3-3 for 15 min in the absence (A) or in presence of excess 14-3-3 (B) or anti-CD13 blocking antibody (AB108310; Abcam) Tyr582 is part of a long, accessible and elongated loop. it is flanked by charged or polarized residues that are compatible with the preferred recognition sequence of 14-3-3, RSXpSXP (mode 1), where pS is a phosphorylated Ser residue. the groove shows a hydrophobic patch whereby L219, L223 and L230 interact with the hydrophobic facet of the ligand peptide. on the other side of its groove, 14-3-3 shows a heavily charged region, composed of K50, K57, R61, R130 and Y131, that is particularly able to accommodate the negatively charged phosphorylated Tyr. however, larger conformational changes for CD13 and probably for 14-3-3 should be investigated to reveal chondrocytes were serum starved and incubated with various concentrations of EFNpYVW peptide. they were then unstimulated or stimulated with 1 g/ml recombinant 14-3-3 for 24 h. the levels of mRNA for MMP-3 (D) and MMP-13 (E) were determined by qRT-PCR. mRNA expression of CD13 was demonstrated in murine chondrocytes. peak of expression was between 24 and 26 cycles. CD13 protein expression was found in articular chondrocyte extracts. mouse chondrocytes transfected with siRNA1 or siRNA2 against CD13 showed significantly decreased expression of CD13 expression at the mRNA level (by 42% and 59%, respectively, as compared with the negative control, P0.05) treatment with 1 g/ml 14-3-3 increased the mRNA and protein levels of MMP-3 by tenfold as compared with the control. ine articular chondrocytes were transfected for 48 h with small interfering (siRNA) targeting the CD13 gene or with negative control AllStars. the cells were then starved and stimulated with recombinant 14-3-3 (1 g/ml) for 24 h. mouse chondrocytes were stimulated with 14-3-3 with or without APNi (0.1 and 1 mM) 14-3-3 did not alter aminopeptidase N activity. similar results were obtained at 60 and 90 min of 14-3-3 stimulation. 14-3-3 invokes the receptor role of CD13 to induce MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression in chondrocytes. the blocking antibody dose dependently decreased 14-3-3-induced MMP-13 mRNA expression. the blocking antibody dose dependently decreased 14-3-3-induced MMP-13 mRNA expression. the blocking antibody alone has no effect on mouse MMP-3 and MMP-13 gene expression. primary cultures of articular chondrocytes from newborn mice were starved. then stimulated with 1 g/ml recombinant 14-3-3 in the presence of an anti-CD13 blocking antibody. treatment with an antibody that blocks only the receptor role of CD13 greatly inhibits the 14-3-3-mediated mRNA and protein expression of both MMP-3 and MMP-13 in murine and human chondrocytes. this suggests that CD13 has a receptor role in transmitting the 14-3-3 signal in chondrocytes and inducing a procatabolic phenotype. 1D1 (blue, 1 g/ml), and isotype IgG1 control (green, 1 g/ml) on recombinant human CD13 immobilized on the sensor chip. the differential response was obtained by subtracting the signal in the blank channel from that in the experimental channel. chondrocytes were treated with biotin\u201314-3-3 for 15 min in the absence (A) or in presence of excess 14-3-3 (B) or anti-CD13 blocking antibody (AB108310; Abcam) (C) y582 is part of a long, accessible and elongated loop. it is flanked by charged or polarized residues. the EFNYVW was docked in the binding groove of 14-3-3. 14-3-3 shows a heavily charged region, composed of K50, K57, R61, R130 and Y131. the 14-3-3 can accommodate the segment E579FNYVW584 of CD13. however, larger conformational changes should be investigated to reveal better recognition between the two proteins. total RNA was extracted and the levels of mRNA for MMP-3 (D) and MMP-13 (E) were determined by qRT-PCR. chondrocytes were subject to preincubation with EFNpYVW and were then stimulated with 14-3-3 in the presence or absence of the peptide. supposed receptor for 14-3-3, in bone\u2013cartilage communication. CD13 is also a receptor for coronavirus and cytomegalovirus. signal transduction has recently been proposed as also being one of the CD13 functions that are independent of its enzymatic activity. anti-CD13 blocking antibody AB108310 for murine chondrocytes and SJ1D1 for osteoarthritis human chondrocytes, inhibited the chondrocyte response to recombinant 14-3-3 by decreasing the expression and release of MMP-3 and MMP-13. AB108310 did not alter the aminopeptidase N enzymatic activity. the decrease in expression and release of MMP-3 and MMP-13 was due to deletion of the receptor role of CD13 but not its enzymatic activity. growing evidence suggests that CD13 might have an array of functions that are independent of its enzymatic activity, including its role as a viral receptor. the hexapeptide E579FNpYVW584 shows an energy of interaction with 14-3-3 in the crystal complex. this ligand shows the highest affinity to 14-3-3 in terms of interaction energy computed, that is, when the Tyr582 was phosphorylated. this segment belongs to an unfolded and accessible loop in CD13. p38 MAPKs and JNK inhibit MMP-3 and MMP-13 expression in response to 14-3-3 in articular chondrocytes. however, no effect of ERK inhibitor on chondrocyte response was found. some published reports have demonstrated a link between 14-3-3 proteins and MAPK signaling cascades. we used human osteoarthritis joint samples to strengthen the concept that CD13 is involved in establishing the procatabolic phenotype induced by 14-3-3 in chondrocytes. the results validated our findings in murine chondrocytes and confirmed that CD13 might play a role in osteoarthritis bone\u2013cartilage communication. rocytes Human cartilage samples were obtained from patients undergoing total joint replacement surgery for osteoarthritis at Saint-Antoine Hospital (Paris, France) these materials are considered surgical waste and are used with informed consent and in accordance with the principles outlined in the Declaration of Helsinki. the osteoarthritis diagnosis was based on clinical and radiographic evaluations according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. cells were then starved in serum-free medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) for 24 h. chondrocytes were treated for 15 min with increasing concentrations (1 and 5 g/ml) of a mouse anti-CD13 antibody. mice and human chondrocytes were incubated for 15 min with two concentrations (5 and 25 M) of MAPK-specific inhibitors. recombinant 14-3-3 (1 g/ml) for 24 h Immunohistochemical analysis. siRNA knockdown of CD13 mouse CD13 knockdown was tested with two different siRNA oligonucleotide sequences. allStars was a negative control. mouse chondrocytes were cultured as described above. the relative mRNA expression of MMP-3, MMP-13 and CD13 were normalized to that of HPRT, as an internal gene reference. for amplification of human cDNA, oligonucleotide primer sequences were for MMP-3, sense 5\u2032-ATGAAAATGAAGTCTTCCGG-3\u2032 and anti-sense 5\u2032-GCAATTATTCCCCATGAACG-3\u2032 and anti-sense 5\u2032-GGGACTTAATCAACGC-3 ELISA Total mouse and human MMP-3 secretion was assayed in cell-free supernatants using an enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kit (R&D Systems) according to manufacturer's instructions, MMP-13 was quantified in culture supernatants from murine chondrocytes using an ELISA kit (R&D Systems) hthylamide (Sigma-Aldrich) in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) was stopped at different times. fluorescence (emission wavelength, 330 nm; excitation wavelength, 460 nm) was measured in the supernatant by spectrofluorescence (Fluostar Galaxy) all assays were performed in duplicate. identical injections were performed in parallel over a blank surface, at 0 RU. data resulted from subtraction of empty-surface RU from active-surface RU. the residues defined as phospho-modified were all mapped on the mature protein (to discard Y6 from the signal peptide) y582 belongs to the hexamer sequence E579FNYVW584 selected for docking. chain A of the solved structure of 14-3-3 in complex with the phosphorylated RQRpSAP ligand (PDB ID 2BR9) served as the starting coordinate. analysis of the complexes involved use of the interaction energy module in DiscoveryStudio. data are expressed as the means.d. relative induction compared with the control (set to 1). the osteoarthritis diagnosis was based on clinical and radiographic evaluations according to the American College of Rheumatology criteria. samples were incubated twice for 45 min each, in 25 ml Liberase (Roche Diagnostics) at 0.52 W\u00fcnsch units (UW/ml) and incubated overnight with 25 ml Liberase at 0.13 UW/ml. mouse articular chondrocytes were isolated by enzymatic digestion of cartilage from mice (5\u20136 days old) after 6 to 7 days of culture, chondrocytes were placed in DMEM (1 g/ml glucose) containing 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 g/ml streptomycin, and 4 mM glutamine. immunohistochemical analysis Mouse and human chondrocytes were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, permeabilized (0.1% Triton X-100), then blocked in a solution of TBS-TC. siRNA knockdown of CD13 mouse CD13 knockdown was tested with two different siRNA oligonucleotide sequence.
