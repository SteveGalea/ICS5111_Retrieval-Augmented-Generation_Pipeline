{"summary": "the genome of PEDV is approximately 28 kb in length and comprises a 5\u2032 untranslated region, non-structural proteins, 4 structural proteins, a non-structural protein ORF3 located between the spike and envelop proteins, and 3\u2032 untranslated region (3). the spike protein is the major envelope glycoprotein of the virion and plays an important role in specific receptor binding, cell membrane fusion, virus entry, and induction of neutralizing antibody (4,5). the intestinal samples were confirmed to be PEDV positive by conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) Primers Primers were designed using computer software Primer 5.0 (Primer, Canada) to amplify ORF3 and S genes, respectively. based on the genome sequence of PEDV CV777 (GenBank No. AF353511) RT-PCR was carried out under conditions: pre-denaturation at 95\u00b0C for 5 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 52\u00b0C for 30 s, extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min and 15 s. the PCR products were gel-purified, cloned into pMD18-T vector. multiple alignments and phylogenetic analyses The nucleotide sequences of the ORF3 and S genes were aligned and analyzed using computer software DNASTAR (DANSTAR, USA). Phylogenetic trees were constructed by the neighbor-joining method using Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis computer software MEGA, version 5.05 (MEGA, Tempe, Arizona, USA). china, 2012 JS-2004-2 AY653204 China, 2004 CH13-GX JQ979288 China, 2012 CH22-JS JQ979290 China, 2012 CH7 JQ239435 China, 2012 LZC EF185992 China, 2007 SM98 GU937797 Korea, 2007 CH-SHT-12-2011 JX242464 China, 2012 CH9-FJ JQ979287 China, 2012 CH6 JQ239434 China, 2012 CH3 Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains for ORF3 gene sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis Isolate Accession number Origin, year CH/ZKFG/11 JN547399 China, 2011 CH/PDSXX/11 JN547398 China, 2011 CH/ZMDZY/11 JN547398 China, 2011 CH/XCYL-2/11 JN547393 China, 2011 CH/JL/09 GU372741 China, 2009 CH/HBQX/10 JN5473 sample collection Porcine intestinal samples were collected between February 2011 and may 2013 from 15 pig farms in mid-eastern China. all of the piglets showed clinical signs of severe watery diarrhea, dehydration, and a high mortality. RNA extraction was performed with RNAiso plus (Takara, Dalian, China) two hundred microliters of the supernatant was used for viral RNA extraction with RNAiso plus (Takara, Dalian, China) the 25L PCR mixture consisted of 12.5L 2Taq Master Mix (Vazyme, Nanjing, China), 10 pmol each of sense and antisense primers of ORF3 or S gene. the PCR products were gel-purified, cloned into pMD18-T vector, and sequenced. strains for S gene sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis Isolate Accession number Origin, year AH2-20123 KC242901 China, 2012 GD8-20129 KC242910 China, 2012 FJZZ9-20128 KC242906 China, 2012 HB-2011-2 JN825708 China, 2011 ZJ-2011-2 JN825711 China, 2011 HB3-20123 KC242902 China, 2012 HB-2012-4 JX435 Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus strains for ORF3 gene sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis Isolate Accession number Origin, year CH/ZKFG/11 JN547399 China, 2011 CH/ZKHFQ/11 JN547394 China, 2011 CH/PDSXX/11 JN547398 China, 2011 CH/XCYL-2/11 JN547393 China, 2011 CH/JL/09 GU372741 China, 2009 CH/HBQX/10 JN54 7395 China, 2010 CH/HLJM/07 GU372735 China, 2011 CH/PDSBF/11 JN547396 China, 2011 CH/XXYY/11 JN547401 China, 2011 CH/GSJI/07 GU372742 China, 2007 CH/GSJII/07 GU372742 China, 2006 CH/IMT/06 GU372739 China, 2006 CH/XCYL/11 JN547393 China, 2011 CH/XX the complete S genes from the 15 field PEDV isolates in this study were submitted to GenBank. the results showed that the S gene from 14 of the 15 isolates, excluding JS120103, were 4161 nucleotides or 1387 deduced amino acids (aa) in length. they had a 15 bp insertion and 6 bp deletion resulting in 1-aa (N) and 4-aa (GEN/DQ) insertion and 2-aa (DG) deletion all PEDV isolates could be divided into 3 genogroups. only one isolate, JS120103, belonged to genogroup 1 together with the European strains (CV777 and Br/87), Korean strains (SM98 and DR13), Japanese strains (MK, 83P-5), and some previous Chinese strains. all PEDV isolates also could be divided into 3 genogroups. the 11 field isolates belonged to genogroup 3 together with other Chinese strains. the vaccine strains CV777, attenuated DR13, and CH/GSJIII/07 belonged in group 1. 14 out of 15 field isolates, except JS120103, are 97.6% to 100% identical in nucleotide sequence or 95.8% to 100% in the deduced amino acid sequence with each other. phylogenetic analysis based on full length of the S genes of 15 field isolates of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus in mid-eastern China. the length of the ORF3 gene was 675 nucleotides encoding a protein of 225 amino acids. the results showed that the length of the ORF3 gene was 675 nucleotides encoding a protein of 225 amino acids. all PEDV isolates also could be divided into 3 genogroups. the 11 field isolates are 95.4% to 100% nucleotide sequence identical or 93.3% to 100% deduced amino acid sequence identical to each other. 37.4% to 52.7% nucleotide sequence identical or 87.0% to 98.1% deduced amino acid sequence identical to the attenuated CV777 and DR13 vaccine strains. the complete S genes of 15 PEDV field isolates collected from 2011 to 2013 were characterized. 14 out of 15 isolates, excluding JS120103, had 15 nucleotide insertions and 6 nucleotide deletions compared to reference strain CV777. the results indicated that 14 out of 15 isolates, excluding JS120103, had 15 nucleotide insertions and 6 nucleotide deletions. 11 field isolates had no 51 nucleotide deletion in the ORF3 gene. all PEDV fell into 3 groups and all 11 Chinese field isolates belonged to group 3."}
