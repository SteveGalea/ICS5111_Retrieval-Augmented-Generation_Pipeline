{"summary": "genome ANNOUNCEMENT Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is an enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus that causes enteritis, vomiting, and watery diarrhea. PEDV was first detected in Belgium and the united kingdom in 1978 (2, 3), and has since been identified in Hungary, Italy, China, and south Korea (4\u20137) piglets infected with PEDV from November 2013 suffered from several enteric diseases. the complete genome of PEDV strain K14JB01 showed high nucleotide sequence homology (99.7 to 99.8%) with variant U.S. strains (USA/Colorado/2013, USA/Iowa/18984/2013, and USA/Indiana/17846/2013, IA1, IA2, and MN) identified in 2013, and with Chinese strains (AH2012, BJ-2011-1, GD-B, and JS-HZ2012) identified the complete genome sequence data of K14JB01 will be the basis of our understanding of the genomic characterization and will contribute to the elucidation of PEDV in south Korea."}
