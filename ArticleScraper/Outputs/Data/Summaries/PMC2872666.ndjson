{"summary": "the striking finding is of reduction in natural killer (NK) cells but preservation of activated effector CD8 T lymphocytes; with viraemia in the patient who had no NK cells. the striking finding is of reduction in natural killer (NK) cells but preservation of activated effector CD8 T lymphocytes. the current pandemic and samples stored from patients offers an opportunity to clarify some of these questions and ultimately improve management of severely ill patients with influenza virus infection. the cases reported here represent the first wave of patients admitted to Intensive Therapy Unit (ITU) in the first UK outbreak of H1N1/09. three patients admitted to Intensive Therapy Unit and ventilated for other conditions provided a comparison for severe illness requiring ITU support (labelled as \u2018non-flu, ITU\u2019) these samples were also analysed using similar conditions; cells were extracted and stored using the same methods. all antibodies were obtained from eBiosciences (Hatfield, UK) eBiosciences compared staining of fresh and stored samples from healthy, uninfected individuals using same panel of mAbs. compared staining of fresh and stored samples from all healthy, uninfected individuals using same panel of mAbs. amplification curve was recorded to capture the point where DNA amplification is exponential. Ct for the \u2018no RNA\u2019 control was greater than 40. in Patient 1, post mortem lung, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, distal small bowel and kidneys were also examined for presence of swine-origin. three patients admitted to Intensive Therapy Unit and ventilated for other conditions provided a comparison for severe illness requiring ITU support (labelled as \u2018non-flu, ITU\u2019) these samples were also analysed using similar conditions; cells were extracted and stored using same methods. all antibodies were obtained from eBiosciences (Hatfield, UK) all antibodies were obtained from eBiosciences (Hatfield, UK) method for flow cytometry staining is as previously described [5], [13] the crossing threshold (Ct) value was recorded for all positive results. this represents positive pick-up of RNA against blank (no RNA) in Patient 1, post mortem lung, lymph nodes, spleen, liver, distal small bowel and kidneys were also examined. patients 1 2 3 Age 38 38 24 Gender F M F Presenting CXR Ill defined patchy consolidation in right and left lower zones Patchy bilateral upper, mid and lower zones consolidations Extensive right lower lobe consolidation and left lower zone patchy consolidations Lymphocytes (x109/l) 3.9 2.6 2.6 Neutrophil count (x109/l) 19.9 7.4 3.0 Monocytes count (x109/l) (normal: 2.5\u20137.5) 0.3 0.9 previous history of left parietal lobe infarction in 1999 secondary to high-grade stenosis of left carotid artery. she was admitted on day 4 and started on broad-spectrum antibiotics. CT pulmonary angiogram on day 5 excluded pulmonary embolism but showed extensive bilateral lower lobe pneumonic consolidation. patchy consolidation in left lower lobe; enlarged cardiothoracic ratio. enlarged cardiothoracic ratio and evidence of pulmonary edema. blood sample for PBMC was obtained on day 46. no other relevant growth in other cultures throughout admission. patient 3 24 year old woman with underlying mild asthma. she had productive cough on admission (Day 3) with extensive right lower lobe and patchy left basal consolidation on CXR. one healthy volunteer had detectable Matrix peptide-specific T cells (H5). the one of four infected, non-ventilated patients who was HLA*A0201 also showed a virus-specific T cell response (P4). markedly raised CD4:CD8 ratio suggests increased peripheral CD4:CD8 T cell ratio is a feature of acute illness. 2 of the three infected, ventilated patients had blood sampled after the acute infection and discharge. all the other 7 patients were sampled during the acute period of illness. no areas of normal lung parenchyma; inflammatory infiltrates scarce. macrophages were evident both morphologically and confirmed with CD68+ staining. none of the 52 community blood samples tested positive for swine-origin H1N1/09 viral RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs. the virus RNA levels remained high in endotracheal secretions for patient 1 throughout the disease course. patients 1 2 3 Age 38 38 24 Gender F M F Presenting CXR Ill defined patchy consolidation in right and left lower zones Patchy bilateral upper, mid and lower zones consolidations Extensive right lower lobe consolidation and left lower zone patchy consolidations Lymphocytes (x109/l) (normal: 1\u20134) 3.9 2.6 2.6 Neutrophil count (x109/l) 19.9 7.4 3.0 Monocytes count (x109/l) (normal: 2.5\u20137.5 patient died 2 days later from multi-organ (lungs, liver, heart) failure. CXR series showed progressive, widespread consolidation throughout disease course. repeated blood cultures, tracheal aspirates and line tip cultures showed no bacterial growth. Neg = Negative Patient 2 38 year old man, smoker (5 cigarettes/day) with Type II diabetes mellitus. alcohol-related dilated cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction of 60\u201365% on admission; diagnosed 2001) blood sample for PBMC was obtained on day 34. patient 1 38 yr old woman, smoker (25\u201340 cigarettes/day), 29 weeks pregnant. previous history of left parietal lobe infarction in 1999. CXR for Patient 2 showed bilateral mid and lower zone consolidations. patchy consolidation in left lower lobe; enlarged cardiothoracic ratio and evidence of pulmonary edema. blood sample for PBMC was obtained on Day 46. no other relevant growth in other cultures throughout admission. patient 3 24 year old woman with underlying mild asthma. the trend was for higher CD4:CD8 ratio in the cases. one healthy volunteer had detectable Matrix peptide-specific T cells (H5) and the one of four H1N1/09 infected, non-ventilated patient who was HLA*A0201 also showed a virus-specific T cell response (P4). both infected, non-ventilated (n = 4) and non-infected, ventilated (n = 3) patients showed a markedly raised CD4:CD8 ratio. NK cells were markedly reduced in all three severely ill, ventilated patients. large areas of haemorrhage were evident throughout a severely injured lung. there were no areas of normal lung parenchyma; inflammatory infiltrates were scarce. macrophages were evident both morphologically and confirmed with CD68+ staining. swine-origin viral RNA was detected in nasopharygeal swab and endotracheal aspirate of all patients but only in plasma of Patient 1. none was detected in any of the 52 community blood samples which tested positive for swine-origin H1N1/09 viral RNA on nasopharyngeal swabs. despite this, several risk factors, and multi-organ impairment, one major difference was the administration of hydrocortisone early in the course of disease. all three patients presented with rapidly progressive and widespread pneumonic consolidation on chest X ray. NK cells are a key component of the innate immunity. they represent about 5\u201320% of circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes. the role of NK cells in influenza A virus infection is understudied. /HLA compound genotypes resulting in greater NK activating profile are associated with resistance to Hepatitis C virus and HIV infection, slower HIV disease progression and reproduction success. the reduction of NK cells in our patients is a primary event increasing the susceptibility of disease or a secondary effect of viral infection. there is evidence that maternal immune responses are diminished during pregnancy. this subset is thought to provide benefit by secreting cytokines, chemokines and angiogenic factors to control trophoblastic invasion of the uterus. the lack of circulating T cells to the conserved Matrix viral protein is not surprising in Patient 1 as it is possible that these cells have homed to the lungs during the acute period. however, some of the remaining activated CD8 effector T cells in Patient 3 are known to fluctuate during infection. viral load and dissemination during first encounter with new virus."}
