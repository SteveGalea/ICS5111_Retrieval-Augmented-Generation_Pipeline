{"summary": "chronic viral hepatitis C (HCV) is characterized by a progression of fibrosis, which ultimately leads to the formation of cirrhosis. liver biopsy is the gold standard method for evaluating the degree of liver fibrosis. however, the invasive nature of liver biopsy makes it impractical. PTX3 deficiency was associated with increased clotting, fibrin and collagen deposition/persistence, epithelial hyperplasia, and defective mature tissue formation at healing. phenotype was attributed to lack of PTX3-dependent facilitated plasmin-mediated fibrinolysis by tissue remodeling cells, which is a prerequisite for appropriate tissue repair. close associations between PTX3 levels, disease progression, and the stages of liver fibrosis were shown [14, 16, 17] only one study concerning the PTX3 polymorphism [18] analyzed the ability of serum PTX3 levels to predict liver fibrosis in HCV patients. authors decided not to include significant fibrosis (F2) group in the study to ensure more homogeneous phenotype. 40 healthy volunteers and 138 patients with chronic hepatitis C were admitted to the department of Infectious Diseases and Hepatology from October 2015 to December 2017. the diagnosis was based on persistently increased alanine aminotransferase values, anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positivity and liver histology features. patients with known substance (alcohol and/or intravenous drugs) abuse as well as those with HIV (human immunodeficiency virus), autoimmune or the presence of F2, F3, or F4 stages was referred to as significant fibrosis (F2). the presence of F3 or F4 stages was referred to as advanced fibrosis (F3) all patients classified as METAVIR F4 have compensated disease. PTX3 levels were determined using the ELISA method (Cloud-Clone Corp., Houston, USA) an ELISA plate reader (model MultiscanTM Go microplate reader, Thermo ScientificTM, Finland) was used to measure the color intensity according to the instructions in the manual provided by the manufacturer. fibroScan\u00ae given as 7.6 (range 5.1\u201310.1), 10.5 (8.0\u201315.4), and 15.3 (11.9\u201326.5) kPa for stages F2, F3, and F4 in chronic hepatitis C patients respectively. Statistical analysis Continuous variables are expressed as median (interquartile range; IQR) or mean standard deviation. the study cohort consisted of 178 adults, including 40 healthy volunteers, and 138 patients with chronic hepatitis C. the diagnosis was based on persistently increased alanine aminotransferase values, anti-HCV and HCV-RNA positivity and liver histology features. the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee of the bioethics committee of the Wroclaw Medical University. fibrosis with rare septa referred to as significant fibrosis. presence of F2, F3, or F4 stages was referred to as significant fibrosis. presence of F3 or F4 stages was referred to as advanced fibrosis. PTX3 levels were determined with the use of the ELISA method. control samples and serum standards with concentrations that ranged from 0.312 to 20.0 ng/mL were included in each run. the minimum detectable dose of PTX3 was typically less than 0.113 ng/mL. the liver stiffness cut-offs were presented on a scale of 0\u20134 according to FibroScan\u00ae given as 7.6 (range 5.1\u201310.1), 10.5 (8.0\u201315.4), and 15.3 (11.9\u201326.5) kPa for stages F2, F3, and F4 in chronic hepatitis C patients respectively. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value were calculated using standard formulas. METAVIR fibrosis scores in HCV patients were F0 (24 patients; 17.4%), F1 (25 patients; 18.1%), F2 (39 patients; 28.3%), F3 (21 patients; 15.2%), and F4 (29 patients; 21%).

PTX3 significantly correlated with the histological stage of liver fibrosis (rho = 0.64, P 0.001) and the levels of PTX3 were significantly higher in patients with significant fibrosis (F2) compared to F0-F1 (P 0.001). PTX3 levels were significantly correlated with HA, transforming growth factor1 (TGF-1) and indirect markers, such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet index (APRI index), FIB4 score, and gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR ratio) the top and bottom of each box represent the first and third quartiles. the line across each box represents the median, covering 50% of the values.

PTX3 was also significantly higher in patients with advanced fibrosis (F3) compared to F0-F2 (P 0.001) PTX3 in histological scores of inflammatory activity and fibrosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C. a positive correlation between LSM and PTX3 level (rho = 0.53, P 0.001) was observed. these results strongly suggest a significant association of PTX3 with the histological severity of liver fibrosis. data were analyzed by using order logistic regression analysis. CI, confidence interval; HA, hyaluronic acid; INR, normalized international ratio; OR, odds ratio; TGF-1, transforming growth factor1. the best marker was PTX3 with AUCs = 0.802 for detecting F2. optimal cut-off values for predicting fibrosis stages F2 and F3 and cirrhosis were 4.48, 5.23, and 6.38 ng/mL, respectively. we analyzed the diagnostic accuracy of PTX3 levels to predict fibrosis stages F2 by ROC. the optimal cut-off point of PTX3 for predicting F2 was 4.48 ng/mL. sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) were 73.0%, 75.5%, 84.4%, and 60.7% respectively. aspartate aminotransferase (AST) to platelet ratio index (APRI index), the FIB4 score, gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase to platelet ratio (GPR ratio) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) cut-off values AUC (95%CI) Sensitivity (%) Specificity (%) PPV (%) NPV (%) P value PTX3 (ng/mL) 4.48 0.802 (0.727-0.8 the field of noninvasive approaches for liver staging has recently evolved. PTX3 provided clinically relevant diagnostic accuracy as a single marker for predicting fibrosis stages. X3 levels, disease progression, and stages of liver fibrosis in patients with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and/or alcoholic hepatitis. PTX3 levels, platelet count, albumin, AST, ALT, GGT, total bilirubin, INR, HA, and TGF-1 were the most significant serum markers associated with severity of liver fibrosis. there are reasons to believe that the increase in circulating PTX3 levels is likely triggered by ongoing production of proinflammatory cytokines at necroinflammatory injury. this phenomenon may also be reflected in the significant correlation between serum PTX3 levels and hepatic necroinflammatory activity (rho = 0.58, P 0.001) noninvasive algorithms for detecting significant and/or advanced fibrosis ranged from 0.740 to 0.870. this was similar to the diagnostic performance of PTX3 (0.756-0.906) results about the possible use of PTX3 as an early marker for predicting fibrosis stages are promising. PTX3 reflects fibrosis-related inflammation and not liver function. recent progress in antiviral treatment has normalized AST and ALT values in many patients even though they still have fibrotic liver."}
