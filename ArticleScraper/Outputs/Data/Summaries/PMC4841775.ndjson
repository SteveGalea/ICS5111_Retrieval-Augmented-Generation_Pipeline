{"summary": "new infections are emerging almost every year (pandemic flu, West Nile encephalitis, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, chikungunya, Ebola) tropical fevers are expanding (dengue, zika) and even previously controlled diseases are re-emerging (measles, poliomyelitis). ducible Gene-I), MDA5 (Melanoma-Differentiation-Associated gene 5) and LGP2 (Laboratory of Genetics and Physiology 2) share a number of structural similarities. they share a number of structural similarities including their organization into three distinct domains. they share a number of structural similarities including their organization into three distinct domains. iii) generation of a cytokine storm that triggers adaptive immune response. iii) generation of a cytokine storm that favours immune cell infiltration. RIG-I confers recognition of hepaciviruses and of members of the Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Orthomyxoviridae families. several DNA viruses have also been reported to activate the RLR pathway. typhimurium, Shigella flexneri also activate type I IFN responses through RIG-I signalling. Plasmodium RNAs are sensed by MDA5 during malaria infection. no studies have yet explored viral RNA partners that bind the three known RLRs. one-STrEP tag provides a reliable, rapid and efficient protocol for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) and protein complexes purification. previous studies have shown that adding N-terminal tags to RLRs had no negative effect on functional interactions with their RNA ligands. over-expression of MDA5 or simultaneous co-expression of LGP2 synergize type I IFN response upon activation with MDA-specific agonists or upon infection with encephalomyocarditis virus. RNA virus replication in ST-RLR stable cell lines express tagged RLRs that are functional and can be purified by affinity chromatography. ST-RLR cells were infected with the rMV2/Fluc (MOIs: 0.05, 1, 2.5) Luc activity was analyzed 5, 19, 24 and 48 hr post-infection. CHIKV is a member of the family togaviridae with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome. reporter Renilla luciferase (Rluc) gene is expressed as an integrated part of the non-structural polyprotein of CHIKV. CHIKV-Rluc replicated in the 4 cell lines as detected by strong Rluc expression and classical growth kinetics for this virus. CHIKV replication was reduced at low MOI in ST-RIG-I cells. wt CHIKV-infected cells were harvested 6, 9, 15, 18 and 23 hr post-infection. wt CHIKV-infected cells were stained with an antibody recognizing double stranded RNA or E2. percentage of positive stained cells was determined by FACS. CHIKV non-structural proteins translation and viral genome replication are performed at early steps of replication. dsRNA presence was assessed in cells infected with wt CHIKV by using intracellular staining with an anti-dsRNA antibody. RNA molecules interacting with RLRs or the negative control CH were then extracted and designated as RLR/RNA or the negative control CH/RNA. we tested the capacity of these RNA molecules to induce an IFN-mediated antiviral response. RNA ligands purified from negative control CH provided poor immunostimulatory activity in the same experimental setup. fluc activity was measured and normalised to mock transfected cells. 5\u20193P was used as a positive control. data represent means SD of the technical triplicates. mRNA expression was done using GAPDH as reference gene and shNeg as reference sample. results are represented as fold increase of ISRE expression compared to mock infected cells. further analysis showed that increasing CHIKV MOI reduced Fluc expression under the control of ISRE promoter in all silenced cell lines. new-world alphaviruses are known to shutdown transcription in infected cells. however, CHIKV infection induces IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Approximately 16 million reads of 51 nucleotides in length were obtained from each sequencing sample. this gave MV genome coverage ranging from 274X to 2433X. total RNA results provided a classical example of the transcription gradient. the distributions of normalized read counts matching the MV genome were represented along the viral genome with the X axis corresponding to all possible positions on the viral genome. the Y axis showing the normalized number of reads that begin at that position was taken into consideration upon statistical analysis. MV 5\u2019 copy-back DI-RNA specifically associates with RIG-I receptor and is efficiently purified using ST-RIG-I cells. MV 5\u2019 copy-back DI-RNA specifically associates with RIG-I receptor and is efficiently purified using ST-RIG-I cells. RT-PCR analysis failed to detect any 5\u2019 copy-back DI RNA in infected ST-RIG-I cells. two DNA fragments of approximately 1 and 4 kb were amplified from total RNA samples using 5\u2019 copy-back DI genome specific primers. RT-PCR analysis revealed that the 1 kb amplicon contained all the 5\u2019 copy-back DI-RNA features. were used for 5\u2019 copy-back DI-genome amplification and JM402 and JM396 \u2013 for MV full-length genome amplification. 10, 5, 2 and 1 ng of RNA were tranfected into STING-37cells. ST-RIG-I cells were infected with MVV. 100, 10, 5, 2 and 1 ng of total RNA were purified from ST-RIG-I cells infected by either MV or MVV recombinant viruses. data represents means SD of technical triplicates of most representative experiment. AU content was calculated in a sliding window of 200 nts with one nucleotide step size. was compared to the mean count within that 200 nt window. results show that RIG-I was preferentially binding AU-rich RNA regions of the MV genome. CHIKV genome Similar protocol of NGS analysis was applied in CHIKV-infected ST-RLR cells. Approximately 16 million reads of 51 nucleotides in length were obtained from each sequencing sample and were mapped to the CHIKV genome. this gave viral genome coverage ranging from 597X to 15363X. the average number of reads obtained for the CHIKV genome in all RLR samples was higher than for MV RLR/RNAs. however, after the statistical analysis LGP2/RNA and MDA5/RNA samples failed to show any specific enrichments in reads corresponding to the CHIKV genome. negative control three other MV mRNAs coding for the MV-N protein were looked for and not found to be enriched in MDA5/RNA samples. we then validated that LGP2 specifically binds the 5\u2019-end of the coding region of the N gene. only the RNA fragment located the farthest to the 5\u2019-end of the N mRNA (N1) was significantly enriched using qPCR. RNA fragments were synthesized in vitro and transfected in A549 cells. qPCR analysis of specific MDA5 RNA ligands was performed. we infected a typical virus-permissive immune cell model (acute monocitic leukemia THP-1 cell line) to perform MDA5-specific RNA isolation by co-IP and RNA analysis by qPCR. this experiment validated that MDA5 has a predisposition to bind MV-N coding region. a stable cell line (assigned ST-CH) expressing the Cherry protein instead of tagged RLRs was generated as a negative control to allow subtraction of non-specific RNA binding. transfection of ST-MDA5 and ST-LGP2 cells with the RIG-I agonist poly(I:C) elicited an increased IFN-I response. RNA virus replication in ST-RLR stable cell lines express tagged tagged RLRs that are functional and can be purified by affinity chromatography. MV belongs to the family Paramyxoviridae (order Mononegavirales) and is often considered as a prototypical member of negative-sense RNA viruses. ST-RLR cells were infected with the rMV2/Fluc (MOIs: 0.05, 1, 2.5) Luc activity was analyzed 5, 19, 24 and 48 hr post-infection. CHIKV replication was reduced at low MOI in ST-RIG-I cells. renLuc activity was analyzed 0, 5, 8, 10, 13, 19, 24, 32 and 40 hr post-infection. renLuc activity was analyzed 0, 5, 8, 10, 13, 19, 24, 32 and 40 hr post-infection. ST-RLR cells were infected with CHIKV-Rluc or wt CHIKV at an MOI of 1. Rluc activity was measured for the CHIKV-Rluc infection. wt CHIKV-infected cells were harvested with an antibody recognizing double stranded RNA or E2. dsRNA accumulation was assessed in cells infected with wt CHIKV. efficient translation of the structural E2 glycoprotein corresponded to the late stage of CHIKV replication was observed at 15 hr post-infection in all three ST-RLR cell lines. RNA ligands purified from negative control CH provided poor immunostimulatory activity. RNAs purified from negative control CH provided poor immunostimulatory activity. RNAs purified from negative control CH provided poor immunostimulatory activity. we depleted STING-37 cells of LGP2, or MDA5 or RIG-I via transduction with lentiviral vectors expressing shRNA against each of these receptors or with a control shRNA. the level of LGP2, MDA5 and RIG-I mRNAs in puromycin-resistant transduced cell populations was assessed by quantitative RT-qPCR. fluc activity was measured 13 hr post-infection and normalized by setting MOI 0 as 100% of ISRE background activity. IRF3 phosphorylation was analysed in STINGshRLR cells after CHIKV infection using a specific antibody recognizing the phosphorylated form of IRF3. we used western blot analysis of RLR-dependent type I IFN signalling to evaluate IRF3 phosphorylation in CHIKV-infected STINGshRLR cells. Interestingly, only in cells deficient in RIG-I, IRF3 was no longer phosphorylated. this data validated the important role of RIG-I in viral sensing for both MV and CHIKV infections. MV transcription is initiated from a single promoter at the 3\u2019 end of the genome. at each gene junction the virus RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase either falloff or continue the transcription of the downstream gene. the normalized read counts on the MV genome are shown in Figure 6\u2014figure supplement 1. the distributions of normalized read counts matching the MV genome are represented along the viral genome with the X axis corresponding to all possible positions on the MV genome. significantly enriched reads are represented in red and non-significantly enriched reads are in blue. LGP2 associated RNA sequences represented only a short part of the N coding region and were also enriched in L gene-derived RNAs with both positive and negative polarities. however, we failed to detect any RIG-I specific reads aligning to the MV genome. this was unexpected since in the above-presented silencing experiment, RIG-I was the only important of the three RLRs sensor for innate immunity activation upon MV infection. sequencing analysis revealed that the 1 kb RT-PCR amplicon contained all the 5\u2019 copy-back DI-RNA features. this 1236 nucleotide-long DI genome included genomic 'trailer' (Tr) and the reverse complement of the Tr sequences at the 3\u2019 and 5\u2019 extremities and the exact complementary of the extremities of 201 nucleotides able to hybridize to form a stem-loop structure. 5\u20193P, poly(I:C) and IFN (200 UI/mL) were used as controls and Fluc activity was measured after 24 hr post-transfection. data represents means SD of the technical triplicates of the most representative experiment. we used MVV infection to verify the efficiency of specific RIG-I ligands purification from ST-RIG-I cells. as a control, we used CH/RNA samples purified in a parallel experiment. this 5\u2019 MV genome region perfectly corresponds to the 1236 nts-long 5\u2019 copy-back DI genome characterized above. RIG-I was preferentially binding AU-rich RNA regions of the MV genome, but only when the DI genomes were generated upon infection with MVV. using Mfold algorithm we performed in silico analysis of the potential to form RNA secondary structures by the different MV genome regions. the distributions of normalized read counts matching the CHIKV genome sequences were represented along the viral genome with the X axis corresponding to all possible positions on the viral genome. the Y axis showing the normalized number of reads that begin at that position was taken into consideration. es subgenomic RNAs are more abundant than genomes in cytoplasm of infected cells. the average number of reads obtained for the CHIKV genome in all RLR samples was higher than for MV RLR/RNAs. after the statistical analysis LGP2/RNA and MDA5/RNA samples failed to show any specific enrichments in reads corresponding to the CHIKV genome. thest to the 5\u2019-end of the N mRNA (N1) was significantly enriched using qPCR. for this, we used a pair of primers detecting only the 49S genomic RNA (CHIKV2) and three others detecting both the 49S genomic and 26S subgenomic RNAs (CHIKV5, 6, 11) of which only CHIKV11 was located at the 3\u2019-end of the genome. fold enrichment for different primers were compared by one-Way-ANOVA and a Tukey Multiple Comparison test. RNA fragments were synthesized in vitro and transfected in A549 cells. we infected a typical virus-permissive immune cell line to perform MDA5-specific RNAs isolation by co-IP and RNA analysis by qPCR. this experiment validated that MDA5 has a predisposition to bind MV-N coding region. this experiment validated that MDA5 has a predisposition to bind MV-N coding region (Figure 10\u2014figure supplement 1). RNA-protein isolation by co-IP approaches can easily underestimate background noise generated by co-IP followed by NGS. the disadvantages of RNA-protein isolation by co-IP are that (i) they rely on the availability of high-affinity antibodies against the protein of interest and (ii) they often lack an appropriate negative control. three biological replicates were performed for each RLR and an appropriate negative control (CH/RNA) allowed subtracting non-specific binding and to perform rigorous statistical analyses. despite the fact that these cells over-expressed one RLR, they were susceptible to infection with different RNA viruses. CHIKV 3\u2019-UTR contains multiple 21 nucleotide-long repeated sequence elements forming dsRNA structures. this is the first time that RIG-I affinity for the 3\u2019-end of a positive-sense RNA virus is demonstrated in physiological conditions. a single population of 546 nts-long 5\u2019 copy-back DI RNA genome has been specifically enriched on RIG-I. the concordance of our results for RIG-I with Baum et al. study nicely confirms the relevance of our strategy. in the future, a deeper NGS study should be done to explain why the RIG-I/RNA sample collected during MV infection possesses immunostimulatory activity. RNA on the L region of the EMCV genome was performed to validate that the L region is a key determinant of the MDA5 stimulatory activity. in vitro studies of MDA5 suggested that MDA5 hypothetically recognizes long dsRNA molecules like poly(I:C) MDA5 binds dsRNA from the stem of the molecule and starts forming filaments towards its extremities. these RNAs were encompassing the MV-N segment (Figure 6A and B) however, the LGP2-specific reads were mostly localized in the 5\u2019-end of the N region. we identified a higher immunostimulatory activity of the 5\u2019-end of the N mRNA compared to RNA fragments of similar size but coming elsewhere from the genome. a dsRNA-containing DI genome was produced by the recombinant MVV. the results suggest that RIG-I recognizes specific RNA secondary structures. MDA5 and LGP2 specificity to AU-rich RNAs was less pronounced. pEXPR-IBA105GW cell lines were cloned by in vitro recombination. plasmids were transfected into HEK-293 cells using JetPrime reagent. CHIKV 06\u201349 strain was isolated from the serum of an adult patient with arthralgia/ myalgia in Saint Louis city, R\u00e9union, France in December 2005. CHIKV-Rluc contains the Rluc reporter gene inserted between the non-structural nsP3 and nsP4 proteins. a two-step PCR strategy was used to generate MVV virus. two PCR fragments were amplified using MV2313 and MV3385 primers. the produced mutated MV fragment was moved into the pTM-MVSchwarz plasmid after digestion with the corresponding restriction enzymes. anti-STrEP-Tag (#34850, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), anti-LGP2 (NBP1-85348, Novus, Littleton, Colorado), anti-MDA5 (#5321, Cell Signaling, Danvers, Massachusetts and AT113, EnzoLifescience, New York, NY) HRP-coupled anti-mouse (NA9310V, GE Healthcare) or monoclonal anti-actin antibody (RPN4301, GE cells were washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and 2% foetal calf serum (FCS) and then fixed in PBS containing 4% paraformaldehyde. cells were washed twice with PBS 2%FCS before analysis by flow cytometry. lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min with gentle mixing every 5 min. the remaining of cell lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C. RNA was dissolved in 80 l of ultrapure water. read mapping, expression quantification and statistical analysis Sequenced reads have been cleaned from adapter sequences and low complexity sequences. reads were aligned to the MV Schwarz strain reference genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/FJ211590.1), and to CHIKV49 strain reference genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/AM258994 truncate adapter = 0 (don\u2019t truncate adapter at 5\u2019-end); leader sequence = 0 (use adapter sequence as a regular adapter at the 3\u2019-end) normalization and differential analyses were carried out between RLR/RNA and Ch/RNA on one hand and between total RLR RNA and total CH RNA on the other hand. copy-back DI-RNAs were amplified from RNA extracted from total RNA extracted from ST-RIG-I using two sets of MV primers. for DI-RNAs, 396 (A: 5\u2019-TATAAGCTTACCAGACAAAGCTGGGAATAGAAACTTCG) and 403 (C: 5\u2019-CGAAGATATTCTGGTGTAGTA) and for standard genome, 396 (A) and 402 (B: 5\u2019-TTTA normalized using expression levels of the GAPDH housekeeping genes and RLR expression level in HEK293 cells was settled as 100% of gene expression. all the measures were performed in triplicate and analysed by StepOnePlusTM software. cDNA synthesis was achieved in 20 L using the SuperScript VILO cDNA Synthesis Kit.
