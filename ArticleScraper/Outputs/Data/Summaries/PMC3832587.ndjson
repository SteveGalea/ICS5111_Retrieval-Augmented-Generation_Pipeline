{"summary": "the aim of this study was to investigate the roles of human herpes viruses (HHVs) and other respiratory viruses in CAP not caused by typical bacterial infection. high rates of viral identification were achieved in infants and young children with respiratory illness in a rural area of china. lower respiratory tract infections (primarily pneumonia) are the leading cause of death worldwide in infants and children [1], [2] there are approximately 150 million cases of childhood community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) each year [1], [3]. CAP is a major cause of morbidity and mortality among children in developing countries. tests have improved the ability to detect multiple viral pathogens. up to two-thirds of childhood pneumonia cases are associated with a viral infection [3]\u2013[11]. the role of HHV and its role in CAP among infants and young children from rural areas has not been well characterized. a total of 354 high-quality induced sputum (IS) samples were obtained from 948 hospitalised infants and young children with respiratory illness in wenling hospital from September of 2007 to April of 2008. the children with presumed nosocomical CAP and lower-quality induced sputum (IS) samples were excluded. Nucleic acid was extracted from 200 L of the virus transport medium (VTM) using a QIAamp MinElute Virus Spin Kit (Qiagen, Germany) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. amplicons of positive for PIC were gel-purified for DNA sequencing using a QIAquick Gel Extraction (Qiagen, Germany) a total of 354 high-quality induced sputum (IS) samples were obtained from 948 hospitalised infants and young children with. the frequency distribution of viral pathogens between CAP and non-CAP were analysed. two hundred and seventy-three samples were preselected from hospitalised children patients who diagnosed as non typical bacterial CAP within 48 hrs of admission. 81 samples from hospitalized children patients were set as a control group, who were clinical diagnosis as non-CAP patients based on chest X-ray and other respiratory signs. all the immunosuppressed or typical bacterial CAP patients were excluded. enteroviruses (EV) or rhinoviruses were identified based on sequence alignment of amplicons. human coronavirus (HCoV)-OC43, -229E, -NL63 and -HKU1, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) using RT-PCR or and HBoV using nested-PCR assays. the mean age of the 273 CAP patients was 1.15 years (standard deviation, 1.15 years, and 14 days to 11 years) most CAP cases are infants with less than 12 months of age (186,68.13%) and male (180,64.9%). the mean admission day after fever was 8.05 days (standard deviation, 9.53 days, and 1\u201361 days). About 52.7% of CAP patients received antibiotics before admission. none was positive for HIV-1 or TB.

HHVs were the most detected co-infection agent with other respiratory viruses. the prevalence of several viral agents (rhinovirus, HBoV, ADV and CMV) among IS samples of CAP were drastically higher than that of non-CAP control group (P0.05). the prevalence of RSV coinfection with HHVs (102/102, 100%) and HBoV (23/102,22.54%) among CAP group was significantly higher than that among non-CAP controls (P0.05). any virus detected 272 99.6 80 98.76 0.406** Paramyxovirus RSV 102 37.4 40 49.4 0.053* PIV-1,2,3 8 2.9 0 0 0.206** HMPV 17 6.2 4 4.9 0.794** Rhinovirus 47 17.2 3 3.7 0.001 * Bocavirus 77 28.2 7 8.6 0.001 * Influenza A 4 1.46 3 3.7 0.199** Influenza B 0 viruses were identified in 272 (99.6%) of 273 CAP subjects. in 80 (98.76%) of 81 non-CAP control subjects. no non-CAP IS samples were positive for HCoV-229E, -NL63, -HKU1 or VZV. oV, ADV and CMV among IS samples of CAP were significantly higher than that of non-CAP control group (P0.05), while prevalence of INF B (5,6.2%) among IS samples of non-CAP were significantly higher than that of CAP group (P = 0.001). 73 of 81 non-CAP cases, however, were also identified as positive (90.1%) for HHVs. infection rate was more than 73.7% for CMV, EBV, HHV-6 and HHV-7 among children older than 3 years. infection rate was more than 73.7% for CMV, EBV, HHV-6 and HHV-7. HHV (102 cases, 100%) and HBoV (23 cases, 22.54%) were the most common concomitantly detected viruses. the clinical manifestation of CAP patients included cough, fever (38\u00b0C), asthma and sputum. a few cases also showed signs of diarrhoea, rhinorrhoea, dyspnea and rale. viral prevalence in sputum specimens of childhood with non typical bacterial CAP was investigated using sensitive molecular diagnostic methods for HHVs and 15 respiratory viruses. viruses were detected in 99.6% of the children. this is the first comprehensive study of the prevalence of HHVs in sputum samples among infants and young children with CAP. the most-detected agent was RSV, followed by HBoV, RV, HMPV, ADV and PIV3 in IS samples from non-CAP group. similar trends were also observed in the prevalence of rhinovirus and ADV among IS samples of CAP when compared with non-CAP control group. a pressed condition caused by HHV infection increases the potential risk of other respiratory virus infections. the detection of viruses in an IS sample by PCR does not necessarily mean that they are the causative agents of the concomitant CAP. this study still has two major limitations. further studies are required to determine the relationship of the presence of HHVs and severity of disease. the clinical significance of HHV infections or co-infections should receive greater attention in future treatment and prevention studies of CAP in infants and children."}
