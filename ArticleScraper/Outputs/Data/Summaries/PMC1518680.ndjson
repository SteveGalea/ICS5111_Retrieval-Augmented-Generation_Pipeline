{"summary": "the need for new antiviral therapies Viruses are formidable targets for drug development. it is difficult to inactivate a virus without doing harm to the host cell. only in the past decade have antiviral drugs come into their own. small RNAs are either exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or endogenous microRNAs. a cytoplasmic RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) cleaves one strand, leaving the remaining unpaired guide strand to search for mRNAs bearing complementary sequences. if the target site on the mRNA has nearly perfect complementarity to the guide siRNA, the mRNA is cut by an Argonaute endon over 90% of plant viruses use double-stranded RNA at some point in their life cycle, making them especially vulnerable to Dicer cleavage and suppression by RNAi. adenovirus elaboration of proteins that bind to and inactivate double-stranded RNAs suggests the viruses are trying to bypass a host response. SV40-encoded microRNAs direct the cleavage of early SV40 transcripts, which encode T antigens. microRNA miR-122 is efficiently expressed in liver cells and matches a sequence in the viral 5\u2032 untranslated region. a recent study shows the feasibility of inhibiting microRNA function in vivo using cholesterol-conjugated 2\u2032-O-methyl siRNAs. s will be most effective at silencing their target gene. the best candidate siRNA sequences need to be determined by experiment. translational inhibition may involve complementarity to just a seven-nucleotide stretch. silencing host genes proximal in these pathways provides another possible type of intervention. hepatitis B and C trigger hepatitis when activated immune cells expressing FasL infiltrate the liver, making them prime targets for immune-mediated apoptosis. this may be possible even for highly diverse and mutation-prone virus, like HIV. flaviviruses silenced both japanese encephalitis virus and west Nile virus. a cocktail of siRNAs targeting viral and host genes is likely to act synergistically to suppress viral replication more effectively and hence reduce the chance of viral escape mutation. there is probably a limit to the number of siRNAs that can be effectively incorporated into any treatment. the key obstacle to harnessing RNAi as a treatment is getting small RNAs into the cytoplasm of cells in vivo. siRNAs mixed with a cationic lipid or even by themselves are efficiently taken up by epithelial cells in the lung and vagina. the mechanism of uptake is not understood. intravenous injection of siRNAs incorporated into liposomes inhibits flavivirus encephalitis. siRNAs targeting HSV-2 genes protected mice from lethal HSV-2 infection. siRNAs penetrated deep into the cervicovaginal tissue, and silencing persisted for over nine days. early studies showing inhibition of hepatitis viral replication required introducing siRNAs via a high-volume bolus (termed hydrodynamic injection) this is invasive and costly. intracerebral injection of siRNAs incorporated into modified liposomes reduced replication of a hepatitis B virus replicon in mice. the paper introduced the concept of inhibiting both viral and host genes to suppress viral entry and replication. the paper introduced the concept of inhibiting both viral and host genes to suppress viral entry and replication. first paper to use RNAi in vitro to inhibit HIV. introduced concept of inhibiting both viral and host genes to suppress viral entry and replication."}
