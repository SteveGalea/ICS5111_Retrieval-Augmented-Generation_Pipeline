{"summary": "small organic molecules have the general chemical formula X\u2013CH Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019 NO\u2013Y. their structural nature endows them their \u201cspin-trap\u201d ability for trapping free radical intermediates (R ) forming stable radical adducts (X\u2013CHR Created by potrace 1.16, written by Peter Selinger 2001-2019 NO\u2013Y) the oxindole moiety has recently attracted attention because of their prevalence in various natural products and biologically active molecules. the key to their activity seems to be the combination of a spiro carbon and a variously substituted oxindole core. the key to their activity is the combination of a spiro carbon and a variously substituted oxindole core. the target compounds 4a\u2013e and 5a\u2013c were prepared by following our previously reported methodology23 which consisted of co-grinding the ketone and hydroxylamine in a mortar. the mixture is placed in a microwave oven without the use of solvent and is irradiated at 600 W or 400 W for variable time periods. nitrones 4a\u2013e and 5a\u2013c were incubated for three days in the presence of the indicated compounds. nitrone 4b inhibited the proliferation of osteosarcoma MG63 cells compared to untreated cells. the active compounds are less effective in inhibiting proliferation of K562 cells. the indanyl derivatives do not possess antiproliferative activity on the tumour cells analyzed. by contrast, isatinyl nitrones containing methyl or benzyl groups possess antiproliferative activity. the RSA% for ketonitrones 4a\u2013e and 5a\u2013c at five different concentrations (i.e., 1.15, 2.45, 4.00, 6.25 and 9.10 10\u20136 mol L\u20131) of the tested compounds with DPPH at 517 nm is reported in Table 2. Percentage of in vitro radical scavenging activity of INs. the substances can be divided into three main groups. the first group is composed of two substances (4c and 4e) with higher values of antioxidant activity than others. for all of these compounds, the RSA% was higher than 60% at a concentration equal to 6.25 10\u20136 mol L\u20131. the EC50 values of all eight synthesized nitrones are higher than that of the reference substance (BHT) the antioxidant properties of INs seem to agree quite well with the biological results. the presence of both aromatic systems and electron-donating groups improves the performance. 0.3\u20133 mL glass vials sealed with a dedicated PEEK screw-cup were used for all reactions. the temperature was always maintained at 180 \u00b0C in each experiment, except for 5a\u2013c where the temperature was always maintained at 125 \u00b0C.
