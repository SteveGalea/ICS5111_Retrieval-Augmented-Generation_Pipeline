{"summary": "federal law compels employers to notify OSHA of any occupational death within 8 hours of the death by telephone or in person at a local OSHA office. the annual death totals derived from \"occupation\" and from \"industry\" classifications differ by 15%\u201320%. no national agency systematically tracks deaths due to occupationally acquired infections. a total of 67,363 workers died of occupational injuries from 1992 to 2002. a total of 28 healthcare workers died of complications related to needlestick exposures. needlestick data therefore reflect only those cases that fall within 6 defined injury definitions. the latent period from initial infection to disease for HIV, tuberculosis, and other infections is measured in years to decades. a worker may sustain a needlestick, become infected with HIV, but not develop clinical symptoms for several years. the tuberculin skin test is notoriously difficult to interpret, with suboptimal sensitivity and specificity. the \"industry\" classification classifies all healthcare workers into \"health services\" the annual death totals derived from \"occupation\" and from \"industry\" classifications differ by 15%\u201320%. deaths from occupationally acquired diseases such as tuberculosis are not routinely captured. nIOSH information is derived from 4 federal health databases as \"nonfatal illnesses\" 4 hospitals submit needlestick and tuberculin conversion data on regular basis. most needlesticks and tuberculin conversions do not result in disease; rarer yet lead to fatal infection. a major difference between these two data sources is the inclusion of self-employed workers in the CPS report. a major difference between these two data sources is the inclusion of self-employed workers in the CPS report. from 2000 to 2002, the Department of Labor reported an average of 77 healthcare worker deaths with the \"industry\" categorization versus 93 deaths with the \"occupation\" category. number employed ( 103) Total deaths Death rate Emergency medical services 116\u2013170 11 64\u201395 Physicians 340\u2013820 10 12\u201329 Registered nurses 2,300 18 8 Home nursing aides, orderlies, and attendant 1,700 13 8 *Rates expressed per 1 million workers. number of deaths by injury reflect 3-year average (2000\u20132002) of violent deaths and do not include infectious causes. hepatitis B CDC estimates that, in 1983, 10,000 healthcare workers became infected with hepatitis B through occupational exposure (M.J. Alter, pers.comm.) in 1983, 10,000 healthcare workers became infected with hepatitis B through occupational exposure (M.J. Alter, pers.comm.) the risk of hepatitis B has diminished by >90% since the introduction of standard precautions and a recombinant vaccine (11) despite vaccine availability, coverage is incomplete because >30% of workers refuse to be vaccinated (11). CDC estimates that 3.9 million people in the united states, or 1.8% of the population, have been infected with hepatitis C virus. human immunodeficiency Virus CDC distinguishes between \"documented\" and \"possible\" occupational transmission of HIV. 26 (46%) of 57 US healthcare workers with voluntarily reported, documented, occupationally acquired HIV infection have progressed to AIDS. 121 (88%) of 138 healthcare workers with possible occupational transmission have progressed to AIDS. treatment for occupationally acquired resistant tuberculosis also has resulted in death. healthcare workers who became latently infected with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis remain at risk for disease reactivation. report from Malawi (35), Ethiopia (36), and south africa (37) describe substantial rises in active cases of tuberculosis among healthcare workers, many of whom die of the disease (25% in a series from Malawi). the number of deaths that result from occupationally acquired infection is an educated guess at best. a nationwide tracking system will accomplish several important goals. a national registry would provide an ongoing reminder of the risk of caring for others. a national registry would provide an ongoing reminder of the risk of caring for others."}
