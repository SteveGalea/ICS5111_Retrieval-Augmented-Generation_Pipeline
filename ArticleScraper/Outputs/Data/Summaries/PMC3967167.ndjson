{"summary": "apoptosis is an effective antiviral instrument which is simple but highly effective. in order to secure its own replication, the virus must prevent or delay apoptosis. in response to this viral hijacking, the PI3K/Akt pathway appears to be involved in the host cell immune response as a form of \u201cadaptive strategy\u201d to counteract viral invasion. PI3K phosphorylates the 3-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of membrane bound phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipid substrates, generating phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphates (PIP3). the most prominent effector of PI3K is the serine/threonine kinase Akt. phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated through receptor-binding (receptor tyrosine kinases) by growth factors (GF) or cytokines (CY) resulting in phosphorylation of PIP2. Akt finally participates in regulation of cellular processes like translation, cell growth and apoptosis. PI3K phosphorylates the 3-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring of membrane bound phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipid substrates, generating phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphates (PIP3) after binding of its pleckstrin homology domain to PIP3, Akt becomes phosphorylated at Thr308 by the phosphoinositide-dependent Akt activity can also be abolished through its dephosphorylation carried out by phosphatases like the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) or the H domain and leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP) the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) is activated through receptor-binding (receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) or G protein-coupled a minute after HIV-1 exposure, more than 200 phosphorylation sites are modified in T-cells. the virus attaches to its host cell and by interacting with its corresponding host-cell receptor induces conformational changes of the viral glycoprotein. this directly leads to the delivery of the capsid into the cytoplasm followed by its uncoating. the virus enters the cell via endocytosis, a process essential in eukaryotes to internalize extracellular molecules inhibition of this signaling pathway is important for further trafficking into the cell. the receptor binding of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) already affects several hundred intracellular phosphorylation events. endocytosis represents an inconspicuous way of entering a host cell by delaying the immune recognition of infection. activation of at least two RTKs followed by signaling events through the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. acidification of the endosomal interior is in part controlled by ERK and PI3K by upregulating the vacuolar H+-ATPase activity. infection with the enveloped vaccinia virus causes a clustering of lipid rafts at the host plasma membrane, leading to co-localization of virus and raft-associated integrin. acute-transforming oncogenic retrovirus, avian leucosis virus (ALV), results in a transient, PI3K-dependent phosphorylation of Akt as early as 15 minutes post infection. treatment of cells with either PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or Wortmannin prior to infection significantly reduces viral replication in a dose-dependent manner. pre-mRNA splicing is a process during which introns are removed and the flanking exons ligated to form the mature mRNA. alternative splicing is regulated by trans-acting splicing factors like SR (serine arginine rich) proteins or hnRNPs (heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins) SRSF1, SRSF7 and SRSF5 can directly be phosphorylated by Akt itself. Akt indirectly phosphorylates SR proteins resulting in their translocation into the nucleus where they bind to pre-mRNAs. hnRNP proteins can also be targeted by Akt-mediated phosphorylation. the study refutes the dogma that the PI3K/Akt pathway only modulates alternative splicing through the regulation of SR proteins. Acinus, a component of the apoptosis-and splicing-associated protein complex (ASAP), was also shown to be directly phosphorylated by Akt, leading to the inhibition of its pro-apoptotic function. a global role of the PI3K signaling pathway in T-cell activation was revealed. adenoviruses and HSV-1 seem to manipulate mRNA splicing in favor of viral gene expression and replication. both viruses do so via hypophosphorylation of particularly two SR proteins. inhibition of the kinase results in an altered phosphorylation pattern of some SR proteins and concomitantly in an alternative splicing pattern of HIV-1 mRNAs. these observations suggest an HIV-1-induced PI3K/Akt-dependent modulation of splicing regulation, which seems to be essential for the viral life cycle. a variety of viral proteins steps into this regulatory network to assure cell survival. Akt blocks its translocation into the nucleus and thus prevents expression of pro-apoptotic genes. viral proteins interacting with the cellular member of the signaling pathways are highlighted in red. NS1 directly activates the PI3K/Akt pathway to secure anti-apoptotic signaling by interacting with the PI3K regulatory subunit p85 [57,58,59,60]. NS1-mediated, but PI3K-independent, prevention of apoptosis as NS1 mutant viruses induced apoptosis, while FCS-activated Akt was not able to overcome this effect. apoptosis is still blocked in an Akt-dependent manner until the virus has accumulated enough Us3 protein kinase to mimic Akt activity. however, in the absence of Us3, the virus appears to have evolved a backup mechanism to retain the activity of Akt thereby ensuring anti-apoptotic signaling. Akt promotes viral persistence by suppressing transcriptional reactivation. reactivation or transition from latency to lytic replication is controlled by the viral transcription activator (RTA), an immediately-early gene, whose activity is negatively regulated by the PI3K/Akt pathway. two members of the poxvirus family hijack PI3K/Akt signaling pathway to prevent apoptosis. dengue virus and japanese encephalitis virus make use of a PI3K-dependent blocking of apoptosis as early as 15 min after infection. however, treatment of infected cells with the PI3K inhibitors LY294002 or Wortmannin did not alter effective viral replication. the PI3K/Akt pathway also mediates survival of the HCV-infected cells. kinase mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) within the mTOR complex 1 is necessary for regulation of cap-dependent translation carried out by eIF4F. after its inhibitory phosphorylation by activated Akt kinase, the TSC is unable to stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity of Rheb. Akt prevents TSC-mediated stimulation of the GTPase Rheb, leading to the activation of mTOR. mTOR then phosphorylates 4E-BP, thereby enabling eIF4F complex formation and thus cap-dependent translation. this is also the case for the vaccinia virus (EBV)-mediated 4E-BP phosphorylation. raptor complex (mTORC1) and rictor complex (mTORC2) activate rictor, the kinase of Akt S473. raptor complex (mTORC2) can mediate an inhibitory phosphorylation of 4E-BP and a stimulatory phosphorylation of p70S6K. another member of the herpes virus family, EBV, affects, in addition to apoptosis. early proteins, E6 and E7, activate Akt/mTOR signaling. also maintain the phosphorylation status by inhibiting the Akt phosphatase PP2A. these signaling events were recently also shown to be triggered by the HPV-mediated EGFR stimulation during viral entry.
