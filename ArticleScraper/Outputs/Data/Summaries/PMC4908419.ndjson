{"summary": "PK15 cells maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing no serum for 48 h were infected with PCV2 strain BJW36 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 50% tissue culture infective dose units (TCID50) per cell and incubated with MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the cell population in G0/G1 phase after infection with UV-treated PCV2 decreased significantly as compared with that in mock-infected cells. together, these data suggest that PCV2 is capable of inducing a G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in the infected cells dependent on viral replication. no significant difference was observed in the amounts of p21 between mock-infected and PCV2-infected cells at the indicated time points postinfection. cyclins D1 and E, as well as p-Rb, were markedly smaller in the PCV2-infected cells than in mock-infected cells. ted with antibodies to cyclin D1, cyclin E, regulatory factor p21, and phosphorylated Rb (Ser795) equal protein loads were verified with -actin blots. bars indicate the ratio of the cell cycle regulatory proteins in PCV2-infected samples to those in mock-infected samples. the results indicated that PCV2 can exploit the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle for its own growth. total lysates of synchronized or nonsynchronized PCV2-infected PK15 cells at 24 h postinfection were assayed for the amount of viral protein synthesis by Western blot analysis. -actin expression was monitored as a loading control. significant upregulation of miRNA-15a (3.7 folds) was observed in the synchronized cells at 24 h postinfection as compared to that in mock-infected cells. miR-21 and miR-34a have been shown to regulate cell cycle progression by targeting relevant G1-to-S transit proteins. however, no changes were observed as compared to that in mock-infected cells. the public miRNA database (RNAhybrid 2.2) predicted that cyclin E might be a target for miR-15a. we have not found the complete 3\u2032 UTR of Sus scrofa cyclin D1 (CCND1). the binding site to miR-15a was found to occur at other species such as the 3\u2032 UTR of gallus gallus cyclin D1 (position 1816\u20131823) miR-15a targets cyclin E mRNA at 3\u2032 UTR. pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vector containing porcine CCNE 3\u2032UTR were co-transfected into synchronized PK15 cells with pRL-TK 24 hours after transfection. inhibition of miR-15a expression can rescue PCV2-induced cell cycle blockage. cells were transfected with miR-15a inhibitor before PCV2 infection for 24 h. inhibition of miR-15a expression can rescue PCV2-induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle block. PK15 cells were transfected with a specific miR-15a inhibitor or control miR-NC followed by infection with PCV2 (MOI = 1) for 24 h. treatment of miR-15a mimics slightly increased PCV2 virus production when compared to that in the PCV2-infected miR-NC-treated cells. a miRNA-15a inhibitor or mimics were inoculated on monolayers of PK15 cells. virus production was assayed by the IFA method. MHV infection was reported to inhibit host cellular DNA synthesis. cyclin D-Cdk4/6 and later by cyclin E-Cdk2 activity, is a critical step in the G1 to S phase transition. infection of PCV2 leads to the decreased expression of both cyclin D1 and cyclin E followed by down-regulation of the Rb phosphorylation, thereby blocking cell cycle progression in G0/G1 phase. miR-15a promotes more efficient PCV2 replication as confirmed by decreased viral protein expression and virus production in the PCV2-infected cells after inhibition of miR-15a expression. this may implicate that miR-15a also regulates expression of cyclin D1 protein via direct interaction with target sequence located at the 3\u2032 UTR. PK15 cells maintained in minimal essential medium (MEM) containing no serum for 48 h were infected with PCV2 strain BJW36 at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 50% tissue culture infective dose units (TCID50) per cell and incubated with MEM supplemented with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) the cell population in G0/G1 phase after infection with UV-treated PCV2 decreased significantly as compared with that in mock-infected cells. together, these data suggest that PCV2 is capable of inducing a G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest in the infected cells dependent on viral replication. the amounts of p21 between mock-infected and PCV2-infected cells at the indicated time points postinfection. the level of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (p-Rb) was significantly reduced after infection. similar observations were reported in other viruses including measles virus44, herpes simplex virus type 120,45, murine coronavirus22, influenza A virus27, and MNV30. cyclin E, regulatory factor p21, and phosphorylated Rb (Ser795) were quantified by densitometric analysis and normalized against -actin. bars indicate the ratio of the cell cycle regulatory proteins in PCV2-infected samples to those in mock-infected samples. PCV2 can exploit the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle for its own growth. total lysates of synchronized or nonsynchronized PCV2-infected PK15 cells at 24 h postinfection were assayed for the amount of viral protein synthesis. -actin expression was monitored as a loading control. significant upregulation of miRNA-15a (3.7 folds) was observed in the synchronized cells at 24 h postinfection as compared to that in mock-infected cells. miR-21 and miR-34a have been shown to regulate cell cycle progression by targeting relevant G1-to-S transit proteins. the public miRNA database predicted that cyclin E might be a target for miR-15a, with a highly conserved binding site occurring at the 3\u2032 UTR of Sus scrofa cyclin E (position 1786 to 1794). the binding site to miR-15a was found to occur at other species such as the 3\u2032 UTR of Gallus gallus cyclin D1 (position 1816\u20131823) miR-15a mimics cyclin E mRNA at 3\u2032 UTR. miR-15a regulates PCV2-induced G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest. pGL3 Luciferase Reporter Vector containing porcine CCNE 3\u2032UTR were co-transfected into synchronized PK15 cells. inhibition of miR-15a expression can rescue PCV2-induced cell cycle blockage. cells were transfected with miR-15a inhibitor before PCV2 infection for 24 h. cell cycle was analyzed by flow cytometry. cyclins D1 and E as well as p-Rb were also recovered.
