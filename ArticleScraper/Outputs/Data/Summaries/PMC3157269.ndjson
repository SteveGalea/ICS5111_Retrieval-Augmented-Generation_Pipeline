{"summary": "porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) is caused by PRRS virus (PRRSV) which belongs to the genus Arteriviridae. this disease is characterized by anorexia, increased late-term abortions, increased number of stillborn pigs, mummified fetuses, weak live-born piglets, increased pre-weaning mortality, and delayed return to estrus 2. the gene expression of the PAMs was investigated using affymetrix microarrays 8. the results suggest that the expression of beta interferon 1 (IFN-) but not of IFN- was strongly upregulated in the early stage of PRRSV infection 8. this study provides global gene expression profiles of lung tissue in vivo and PAMs in vitro following infection with PRRSV. rabies virus (PRV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) were determined by ELISA test for serum antibodies. twelve 5-week-old tongcheng boars were obtained from three litters. individuals within a full-sib litter were separated into two groups. cDNA was synthesized using oligo(dT)15 primer, M-MLV Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) in 50 l reaction mixture according to manufacturer's instructions. pET-18M plasmid of the known copy number containing the ORF7 fragment generated standard curve. RNA extraction and microarray hybridization TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used for RNA extractions. the false discovery rate (FDR) values were generated using permutations of repeated measurements to estimate the percentage of genes identified by chance. the fold-change of 1.5 and a false discovery rate of approximately 5% were set as a threshold. the data analysis procedure was performed as described previously 15. piglets used in this study were free from PRRSV, pseudorabies virus (PRV) and porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) determined by ELISA test for serum antibodies. infected groups were challenged with PRRSV-WUH3 (3 ml/15 kg, 10-5 TCID50/ml) by intramuscular inoculation. serum samples for viremia detection were collected daily from all animals (one ml blood per sampling point) pET-18M plasmid of the known copy number containing the ORF7 fragment generated standard curve. RNA extraction and microarray hybridization TRIzol (Invitrogen) was used for RNA extractions. RNA integrity and concentration were evaluated by denaturing formaldehyde gel electrophoresis. gene expressions were performed for hierarchical cluster (Ver.3.0) and treeView (Ver.1.60) analyses 17. Q-PCR The RNA samples prepared for microarray analysis were also used for Q-PCR verification. the average rectal temperature rose to above 40.5 oC at 2 dpi and seemed to peak at 5 dpi. the two piglets surviving at 5 dpi showed a slight decrease of rectal temperature in the following two days. the scores of 0 to 100 denote the different severity of gross lung lesion, from intact to totally damaged. the low scores indicated a mild regional lung damage at 5 and 7 days after HP-PRRSV infection. 166 genes were classified into 47 categories, many of which shared the same genes. the majority of genes related to the virus-host cell interaction could be assigned into the categories including cell death and apoptosis related. al organelles 23, a negative regulator of TRIF-dependent toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling 24 and MAPK phosphorylation 25, was significantly downregulated. SBNO2, a potent inhibitor of NF-B 26, and SOCS1 which limits NF-B signaling by decreasing p65 stability within the cell nucleus 27 were upregulated. however, no type-I IFN or IFN-induction was observed. red background in the gene box indicates upregulation of the gene expression, green indicates downregulation, and white indicates no change of the gene expression. the differentially expressed genes are 1.94 (ATP6V1B2), 0.31 (SARM1), 4.58 (IRF7), 1.79 (SOCS1), 1.59 (SBNO2), 1.81 (NMI) and 2.48 (STAT1), respectively. interferon induced transmembrane protein 3 (1-8U) Ssc.30956.1.A1_s_at 6.05 ISG15 ISG15 ubiquitin-like modifier Ssc.11557.1.A1_at 7.89 MX1 myxovirus (influenza virus) resistance 1, interferon-inducible protein p78 (mouse) Ssc.221.1.S1_at 4.45 NMI N-myc (and ST transport proteins from the cis end of the Golgi complex back to the rough ER 29 and SEC31L2 were both downregulated. de genes and their relation to different aspects of the host cell organization Gene symbol Gene description Affymetrix probe set ID Fold Change Cytoskeleton S100A6 S100 calcium binding protein A6 Ssc.21109.1.S1_a_at 4.87 MARCKS-like 1 Ssc.1228.1.S1_at 3.28 CCT6A KIF11 kinesin family member 11 Ssc.30748.1.S1_at 0.40 Exocytosis and vesicle trafficking RSAD2 radical S-adenosyl methionine domain containing 2 Ssc.286.1.S1_s_at 9.74 GSK3B glycogen synthase 3 beta Ssc.30917.1.A1_at 3.09 LMAN2L lectin, mannose-binding 2- LD 6 Ssc.26483.1.A1_at 1.66 HERC3 hect domain and RLD 3 Ssc.9737.1.S1_at 0.39 UBASH3B ubiquitin associated and SH3 domain containing B Ssc.25139.3.S1_at 0.35 Chaperones NPM3 nucleophosmin/nucleoplasmin 3 Ssc.6196.1.S1_at 2.23 CCT3 HSPA4 heat shock 70kDa protein 4 Ssc.3313.1.S1_at 2.46 HSPA6 heat shock 70kDa protein 6 (HSP70B') Ssc.6728.1.S1_at 1.60 HSPD1 heat shock 60kDa protein 1 (chaperonin) Ssc.6719.1.A1_at 1.83 HSPH1 heat shock 105kDa/110kDa protein 1 Ssc.1231.1 HC-type containing 9 Ssc.16227.1.S1_at 16.57 ZFAND2A zinc finger, AN1-type domain 2A Ssc.5082.1.S1_at 2.75 ZCWPW1 zinc finger, CW type with PWWP domain 1 Ssc.31003.1.A1_at 2.04 ZFP2 ZFP2 zinc finger protein 2 homolog Ssc.7514.1.A1_at 1.84 ZNF258 Upon HP-PRRSV infection, several DE genes were involved in the intracellular calcium homeostasis in PAMs. zinc ion concentration in PAMs seemed to be increased, through upregulating the expression of SLC39A14 which encodes a zinc influx transporter 31. a set of DE genes involved in the dynamic regulation of the extracellular matrix and vascular permeability was identified.

HP-PRRSV infection has affected PAMs in vivo in expression of important genes involved in cytoskeleton and exocytosis organization, protein degradation and folding, intracellular calcium and zinc homeostasis. inhibition of the complement system likely attenuated the lung damage during HP-PRRSV infection."}
