{"summary": "a single dose of the YFV-17D vaccine is sufficient to confer sustained immunity and lifelong protection against yellow fever disease. the decline in herd immunity and discontinuation of mosquito control measures in many parts of africa are considered the major causes for the resurgence of yellow fever. the viral polyprotein is cotranslationally and posttranslationally processed into three structural and seven nonstructural (NS) proteins by host cellular and viral proteases. the seven NS proteins, NS1, NS2A, NS2B, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, and NS5, form membrane-bound replication complexes for replication of the viral RNA genome. the in vivo antiviral efficacies of these direct-acting antiviral agents have been demonstrated in animal models. however, none of them has reached human clinical trials. a phase II clinical trial of Balapiravir failed to improve clinical and virological parameters in patients. based IFN- promoter reporter assay, we identified a benzodiazepine compound that potently inhibits YFV. replacement of the proline at amino acid 219 of the NS4B protein with serine conferred YFV resistance to the compound. the compound protected 90% of YFV-infected hamsters from death, significantly reduced the viral load, and normalized liver function. BDAA and its enantiomers were synthesized in-house with greater than 95% purity. BDAA was prepared in a solution of Solutol HS15 and methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP; Sigma-Aldrich) in a 1:1 ratio. total cellular RNA was extracted from Huh7.5 or C6/C36 cells at 2 days postinfection (dpi) with YFV at the indicated MOI by using the NucleoSpin 96 RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) the amounts of YFV RNA were determined in a quantitative one-step reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. the dose-dependency curves were generated to determine the inhibitory concentration required to inhibit cell viability by 50% (CC50) the YFV 17D strain rescued from an infectious cDNA clone was used to infect Huh7.5 cells. mutants were synthesized and amplified by RT-PCR. mutants were identified by sequence alignment with parental YFV 17D cDNA. mutants were rescued by electroporation of cells with in vitro-transcribed RNA. single-dose pharmacokinetics studies were performed for BDAA in mice. intravenous (i.v.), oral (per os [p.o.]), intramuscular (i.m.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration routes were included with dose levels of either 2 mg/kg of body weight (i.v.) or 10 mg/kg for all other routes. female golden hamsters (Charles River Laboratories) with an average weight of 110 g were used after a quarantine period of greater than 48 h. infected animals were treated twice daily with 100 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, or 25 mg/kg of BDAA for 7 days beginning at 4 h prior to infection via oral administration. al Animal Care and Use Committee of Utah State University (identification number 2400) survival data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon log-rank survival analysis. all other statistical analyses were performed using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a Bonferroni group comparison. clinical psychoactive benzodiazepines (alprazolam, estazolam, nordiazepam, temazepam, prazepam, and lorazepam) were obtained from a certified reference material provider (Cerilliant) for in vivo studies, BDAA was prepared in a solution of Solutol HS15 (Sigma-Aldrich) and methyl-2-pyrrolidinone (NMP; Sigma-Ald the amounts of YFV RNA were determined in a quantitative one-step reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR) assay. aedes albopictus S7 ribosomal mRNA was quantified with the primers 5\u2032-CCAACCGCGAGAAGATGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-CCAGAGGTGAGTTTCAGCAA-3\u2032 to normalize the levels of viral RNA in. s were generated to determine the inhibitory concentration required to inhibit cell viability by 50% (CC50) the YFV 17D strain rescued from an infectious cDNA clone was used to infect Huh7.5 cells. plasmids containing full-length YFV 17D cDNA clones with desired point mutations were synthesized and confirmed by DNA sequencing (GenScript) mutants were rescued by electroporation of Huh7.5 cells with in vitro-transcribed RNA from each of the clones. single-dose pharmacokinetics (PK) studies were performed for BDAA in mice. intravenous (i.v.), oral (per os [p.o.]), intramuscular (i.m.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration routes were included with dose levels of either 2 mg/kg of body weight (i.v.) or 10 mg/kg for all other routes. the infected hamsters were treated twice daily with 100 mg/kg, 50 mg/kg, or 25 mg/kg of BDAA for 7 days beginning at 4 h prior to infection via oral administration. a placebo-treated infection control group was included. the survival rate was observed until day 21 postinfection. in vivo efficacy study, survival data were analyzed using the Wilcoxon log-rank survival analysis. RESULTS Discovery of a benzodiazepine compound that specifically inhibits YFV. BDAA caused dose-dependent inhibition of YFV envelope protein expression, RNA replication, and progeny virion production. treatment of YFV-infected cultures with 2 or 10 M BDAA reduced progeny virion production by >2 to 4 logs. similar antiviral results against YFV were also obtained in HEK293 and Vero cells in a qRT-PCR assay. total intracellular RNAs were extracted to determine the amount of YFV RNA by qRT-PCR. YFV RNAs were normalized to -actin mRNA and presented as the percentage of mock treated control (C) values represent average results from a triplicate experiment ( standard deviations) yxoviridae Influenza A/California/7/2009 MDCK CPE >100 ND >100 Hepatitis B virus Hepadnaviridae ayw HepG2.215 Hybridization >100 ND >100 Human papillomavirus Papillomaviridae HPV-11 HEK293 qPCR 3 71 >100 Norovirus Caliciviridae GI HG23 Hybridization BDAA is a benzodiazepine compound with two chiral centers. we synthesized and compared the antiviral activity of the four enantiomers against YFV. the rank order of the potency of the enantiomers to inhibit YFV RNA replication in Huh7.5 cells was (S,S) > (R,S) > (R,R), with EC50s of 0.2, 0.5, 2.4, and >10 M benzodiazepine drugs are the most common antianxiety drugs administered around the world (50) benzodiazepine receptor binding activities depend on distinct structural features. benzodiazepine drugs can also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors (PBR), which are structurally unrelated to GABAAR. to investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of benzodiazepines in antiviral and receptor binding activities, we first tested six representative clinical psychoactive benzodiazepine drugs for their antiviral activities against YFV. BDAA potently inhibited YFV RNA replication in Huh7.5 cells, but none of the six clinically used benzodiazepine drugs demonstrated any detectable inhibitory effects on YFV infection. affinities of BDAA to central and peripheral nervous system benzodiazepine receptors were measured in radioligand competitive binding assays. BDAA does not inhibit early steps of YFV replication. addition of BDAA as late as 12 h postinfection was still able to potently inhibit viral RNA replication. treatment starting at 24 h postinhibition reduced viral RNA by approximately 40%. BDAA most likely inhibits a postentry step of YFV replication. culture medium was harvested and inoculated into a fresh Huh7.5 culture in the presence of BDAA. extensive CPE was observed at passage 18 in cells treated with 8 M BDAA. resistance of selected YFV strain to BDAA was validated. NS4B protein transmembrane domain 5 (pTMD5) of YFV and other flaviviruses is shown at the top of amino acid sequence. the predicted membrane topology of YFV NS4B is shown at the top of amino acid sequence. cDNA segments covering entire genomic RNA were amplified. the flaviviral NS4B are integral membrane proteins and are localized in cytoplasmic foci originating from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) studies of DENV NS4B suggest that the protein is an essential component of the viral RNA replication complex (54) parental YFV 17D, P219S, or P219T RNA induced CPE at day 4 posttransfection. the cells were lysed in serum-free DMEM by three freeze-thaw cycles. the cells were lysed in serum-free DMEM by three freeze-thaw cycles. yFV RNA was detected by qRT-PCR assay and normalized to -actin mRNA levels. yFV RNA was detected by a qRT-PCR assay and normalized to -actin mRNA levels. we then determined the sensitivity of the three mutant viruses to BDAA. total cellular RNAs were extracted to detect YFV RNA in a qRT-PCR assay. supernatants from the cultures were harvested to determine the virus yields in a plaque assay in Vero cells (D) data are mean results from four independent replicate experiments. YFV RNA was normalized as described for Fig. 6A. s of cell-associated virions (B) and secreted infectious virions (C) at the indicated times postinfection were quantified in a qRT-PCR assay. total cellular RNAs were extracted to detect YFV RNA in a qRT-PCR assay. values are percentages relative to mock-treated controls. proline 219 is critical to confer sensitivity to BDAA, but it is not essential for YFV replication. administration of 10 mg/kg BDAA, the plasma concentration of BDAA was maintained above 0.2 M. in order to find the MTD of BDAA in animals, a repeated-dose oral and i.p. study was performed in mice. the results showed that oral administration of BDAA at the highest dose tested (100 mg/kg three times daily for 7 days) was very well tolerated. however, administration of BDAA with a dosing schedule of 100 mg/kg three times between 3 and 6 dpi, levels of serum ALT at 6 dpi, and also virus titers at 4 dpi in serum were measured to determine the activities of the test compound in suppressing viral replication. three groups of infected animals were treated with escalated doses of BDAA twice daily (BID) via oral administration for 7 days, beginning 4 h prior to infection. improvement of YFV-infected animal survival was observed in groups treated with 100 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of BDAA twice daily orally. the lowest dose of 25 mg/kg BDAA twice daily resulted in a survival curve that was similar to that for placebo treatment. dosing with 100 mg/kg of BDAA beginning just prior to virus challenge resulted in an approximate 2-log10 reduction in virus titer in serum at 4 dpi compared with placebo treatment. sham-infected animals were also included as controls. antiviral activity against YFV was demonstrated in three independent assays in human hepatoma cell line Huh7.5. BDAA caused dose-dependent inhibition of YFV envelope protein expression, RNA replication, and progeny virion production. Huh7.5 cells seeded in 96-well plates were infected with YFV strain 17D at an MOI of 0.01 for 1 h. cell viability was determined using DRAQ 5 and Sapphire 700 stains (red) total intracellular RNAs were extracted to determine the amount of YFV RNA by qRT-PCR. togaviridae TRVL11573 Vero CPE 18 ND 40 Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus Togaviridae TC-83 Vero CPE 32 ND 32 BK virus Papovaviridae Gardner HFF CPE 62.4 ND >100 JC virus MAD-1 Cos7 qPCR 95.5 ND >100 Vaccinia virus Poxviridae Copenhagen HFF CPE >100 ND >100 Influenza A H1 Zika virus Zika-016 Vero 76 CPE >100 ND >100 Dengue virus DENV-2 New guinea C Vero Yield reduction ND 8.6 >50 Yellow fever virus 17D Vero 76 CPE 0.05 ND >50 Vero 76 Yield reduction ND 0.03 >50 Huh7.5 qPCR# 0.21 0.37 >100 HEK293 qPCR# 0.17 0.30 >50 Vero qPCR# 0.13 0.27 >100 yFV RNAs were normalized to -actin mRNA levels. values represent mean results from four independent replicates. benzodiazepine is the most common antianxiety drugs administered around the world (50) BDAA is structurally similar to benzodiazepine drugs used in the clinic. the goal is to develop benzodiazepines with potent anti-YFV activity. but without psychiatric or other pharmacological/toxicological activities, we first tested six representative clinical psychoactive benzodiazepine drugs for their antiviral activities. 0.3 M diazepam and PK11195 completely inhibited the labeled ligand binding to GABAAR and PBR. 10 M BDAA reduced the labeled ligand binding to their cognate receptors by less than 15%. the results thus indicate that the anti-YFV and psychiatric activities of benzodiazepines rely on distinct structural features. time-of-addition analysis of BDAA antiviral activity against YFV. BDAA was present either transiently for 2 h before infection (2 to 0), during infection (0, 1), or added at the indicated time points until 48 h postinfection. BDAA most likely inhibits a postentry step of YFV replication. yFV RNAs were normalized to -actin mRNA levels. each data point is the mean results from four independent replicates. selection and genetic analysis of BDAA-resistant YFV. the culture medium was harvested as a BDAA-resistant YFV stock. effects of BDAA on parental YFV 17D and BDAA-resistant virus were determined in a virus yield reduction assay. sequence alignments between parental and drug-resistant viruses revealed only a single-nucleotide mutation, from C to U, at nucleotide 7423 in BDAA-resistant YFV. this resulted in the replacement of proline at amino acid 219 (P219) of the NS4B protein with a serine. such a difference may account for the selective inhibition of BDAA for YFV but not other flaviviruses. parental YFV 17D, P219S, P219T, and P219A RNA-transfected cells produced similar amounts of viruses, ranging from 8 104 to 1.2 105 PFU/ml. no infectious virus could be detected from the culture medium of P219G RNA-transfected cells. YFV 17D and P219G RNA-transfected cells produced 60-fold less cell-free viruses than did YFV 17D RNA-transfected cells. NS4B mutation may compromise virus replication and/or secretion of infectious virions. the YFV RNA arbitrary units are the amount relative to that of the RNA level in uninfected cells (A) supernatants from the cultures were harvested to determine the virus yields in a plaque assay (standard deviations) (B) Huh7.5 cells were infected with cell-associated viruses harvested from YFV 17D or P219G YFV at an MOI of 0.1 for 1 h. intracellular viral RNA (A) and yields of cell-associated virions (B) and secreted infectious virions (C) at the indicated times postinfection were quantified. YFV 17D RNA replication, with an EC50 of 0.08 M, all three mutant viruses were resistant to BDAA, with EC50s ranging from 0.4 to 4.7 M. the P219S mutant virus demonstrated the highest level of resistance to BDAA inhibition. a single dose of BDAA was administered i.v., p.o., s.c., i.m. or i.p. routes. blood samples were obtained at various time points postadministration. BDAA showed good oral bioavailability (35%) and good retention of drug. at 8 h post-oral administration of 10 mg/kg BDAA, the plasma concentration of BDAA was maintained above 0.2 M. the highest equilibrium solubility of BDAA in solutol:cremaphore:saline diluent was 100 mg/ml. due to its relatively low aqueous solubility, it was difficult to keep BDAA in solution in order to dose the animals at the 150-mg/kg dose. a 100-mg/kg/dose level was selected as the highest dose for the efficacy study. hamsters infected with YFV treated with various doses of BDAA or with ribavirin. ***, P 0.001; **, P 0.01; *, P 0.05 compared with placebo. improvement of YFV-infected animal survival was observed in groups treated with 100 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg of BDAA twice daily orally. serum ALT levels were significantly reduced in animals treated with 100 mg/kg of BDAA. a trend toward reduced ALT was also observed in the 50-mg/kg/dose group. sham-infected animals were also included as controls. a single amino acid substitution in NS4B, P219S, was identified to confer YFV resistance to BDAA. NS4B is a nonenzymatic integral membrane protein (53) flavivirus NS4B proteins participate in viral RNA replication and evasion of host innate immune response (55) NS4B dimerization and interaction with other viral and host cellular proteins are important for its function in viral RNA replication. blocking the NS4B protein interaction with other viral and host cellular proteins could lead to direct inhibition of viral RNA replication or, alternatively, could act through activation of the host innate antiviral response to restrict viral replication. spiropyrazolopyridone and BDAA may directly target NS4B protein. other NS4B inhibitors may disrupt NS4B function via targeting host cellular enzymes or other proteins that interact with NS4B. nonenzymatic viral structural and nonstructural proteins have been shown to be the targets of highly selective and potent antiviral agents over the last decade. yFV NS4B inhibitor BDAA protected 90% of YFV-infected hamsters from death, significantly reduced viral load by greater than 2 logs, and attenuated virus infection-induced liver injury and body weight loss."}
