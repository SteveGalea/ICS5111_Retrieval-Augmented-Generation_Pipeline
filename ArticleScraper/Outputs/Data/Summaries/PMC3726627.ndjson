{"summary": "kilobase positive-strand coronavirus genome and subgenomic (sg) mRNAs of shorter lengths are 5\u2019 capped and 3\u2019 polyadenylated as are most eukaryotic mRNAs. they share a common leader sequence (65 to 90 nucleotides) and a common 3\u2019 untranslated region (300 nt) a well-studied example of cytoplasmic regulation of poly(A) tail length occurs in oocyte mRNAs. in the cytoplasm of oocytes, certain mRNAs have relatively short poly(A) tails (20-40 nt) and are translationally inactive. the poly(A) tail is elongated to nearly 150 nt by cytoplasmic polyadenylation. RNA extracted from BCoV harvested at 48 hpi was decapped and head-to-tail ligated. the amplified RT-PCR product was sequenced to determine poly(A) tail length. the poly(A) tail length was 45 nt. l was used to infect freshly-confluent HRT-18 cells with an MOI of 10 viruses per cell. total cellular RNA was extracted at the time points indicated in Figure 2A. length of RT-PCR products ranged from 250 to 300 base pairs (bp) RNA co-varies nearly in size with the 3\u2019 poly(A) tail on total positive-strand RNA. the mechanisms by which the coronaviral poly(A) tail and poly(U) tract are made are unknown. the extent and timing of antigenomic poly(U) synthesis were measured and compared with the appearance of poly(A) poly(U) tract length was 40 nt during the first 2 h of infection, increased to 65 nt from 4\u20139 h of infection, and then decreased to 50 nt by 24 hpi, and 25 nt by 144 hpi. RT-PCR reveals a 300 bp product with RNA from BCoV-infected cells. RT-PCR reaction mixture containing RNA from BCoV-infected cells at 9 hpi along with a single primer that binds actin mRNA (lane 2). samples from a complete reaction with RNA from infected cells at 9 hpi served as a size reference. RT-PCR products of 1.8 kb for subgenomic mRNA 7 positive strand were also detected. smear of faint bands above and below the 1.8 kb fragment were of unidentifiable mixed sequence. RT-PCR products of 1.8 kb for subgenomic mRNA 7 negative strand were also detected. lengths of poly(A) on positive-strand subgenomic mRNA 7 were determined to be 30, 64, 38 and 34 nt at 2, 8, 24 and 48 hpi. length of poly(A) tail on subgenomic mRNA 7 negative strands to be 32, 61, 41 and 29 nt at 2, 8, 24 and 48 hpi. method used to determine length of poly(U) tail on negative-strand subgenomic mRNA 7 is the same as that for positive-strand subgenomic mRNA 7 except the primer used for RT was primer 3. RT-PCR product was sequenced to determine subgenomic mRNA 7 poly(U) tract length. length of subgenomic mRNA 7 RT-PCR products containing poly(A) or poly(U) tract was near 1.8 kb at different times BCoV was used as helper virus and DI RNA-M was transfected into BCoV-infected HRT-18 cells. the poly(A) tail length of packaged DI RNA\u2013M in the VP1 virus used for inoculum was determined to be 26 nt by the same strategy as shown in Figure 1A. RT-PCR products were detected (Figure 5C, right panel) and sequenced to determine poly(U) length. the same primers were used as for poly(A) measurement but in reverse order. a 200-nt negative-strand RT-PCR product was not found from RT-PCR reactions. kinetics of the poly(A) and poly(U) lengths parallel those measured for the total RNA and sgmRNA 7 described above. the poly(A) and poly(U) lengths on BCoV DI RNA are regulated throughout replication. this method enables discrimination between helper virus RNA and DI RNA-M. RNA-M poly(A) tail (left panel) and poly(U) tract (right panel) ranged from 200 bp to 250 bp at different times following infection with virus passage 1 (VP1) or 2 (VP2). RT-PCR with primers 5 and 2 reveals a 200-bp product with RNA extracted from total cell RNA collected at 24 hpi with DI RNA-M-containing BCoV (lane 1), but not from a mixture of RNA extracted from polyadenylation in oocytes activates translation of dormant mRNAs with short poly(A) tails. the increase in poly(A) tail length on the coronavirus genome is a condition-dependent enhancement of translation. poly(A) tails with distinct lengths of 25, 45, and 65 nt were found on replicating DI RNAs in infected cells. Northern analyses were carried out on electrophoretically-separated RNA in samples from the same experiment. the His-tag-encoding replication-defective BCoV DI RNA was measured with a probe specific for the 30-nt reporter sequence in BCoV DI RNA. the N-encoding sgmRNA 7 from helper virus steadily increased over time in the presence of all three DI RNA constructs. protein samples from cell lysates were harvested at 4, 8, and 21 hpt. the His-tagged protein (row 1) and cellular actin (row 2) were measured by Western blotting. RNA was extracted at the indicated times. an increase in accumulated His-tagged protein in the presence of a decreasing DI RNA abundance is, therefore, apparently due to a longer half-life of the protein molecule. the enhancement of viral translation efficiency by a longer coronavirus poly(A) tail suggests that poly(A) tail length plays a role in the regulation of coronaviral genome translation. poly(A) tail length on total BCoV positive-strand RNA varies during infection. RNA extracted from BCoV harvested at 48 hpi was decapped and head-to-tail ligated. RNA extracted from BCoV 5\u2019 UTR-positive-strand-specific primer 2 and BCoV 3\u2019 UTR-negative-strand specific primer 1 were used for RT-PCR with the ligated RNA as template. the length of viral poly(A) tail became 30 nt after 144 h of infection. the length of viral poly(A) tail became 30 nt after 144 h of infection. RT-PCR products ranging in length from 250 bp to 300 bp were observed. samples from a complete reaction with RNA from infected cells at 9 hpi served as a size reference. a faint band migrating with an apparent size of 400 nt was also found from 4 through 144 hpi. but when gel-purified, cloned and sequenced it was found to contain the same sequence as the major band. poly(U) tract length was 40 nt during the first 2 h of infection, increased to 65 nt from 4\u20139 h of infection, and then decreased to 50 nt by 24 hpi, and 25 nt by 144 hpi. RT-PCR reveals a 300 bp product with RNA from BCoV-infected cells extracted at 9 hpi (lane 1). RT-PCR products of 1.8 kb for subgenomic mRNA 7 positive strand were also detected. RT-PCR products of 1.8 kb for subgenomic mRNA 7 negative strand were also detected. RT-PCR products of 1.8 kb for subgenomic mRNA 7 negative strand were of unidentifiable mixed sequence as determined by cloning and sequencing. nor were they found from RT-PCR reaction mixtures that contained RNA from infected cells at 8 hpi but no exogenously-added primer. the lengths of poly(A) on positive-strand subgenomic mRNA 7 were determined to be 30, 64, 38 and 34 n poly(U) tract on subgenomic mRNA 7 negative strands co-vary closely in kinetics and size with those on total viral positive and negative strands. strategy for determining poly(A) tail length on coronaviral subgenomic mRNA 7 positive strand. length of subgenomic mRNA 7 RT-PCR products containing poly(A) or poly(U) was near 1.8 kb at different times postinfection. length of coronaviral subgenomic RNA 7 poly(A) tail and subgenomic RNA 7 poly(U) tract was near 1.8 kb at different times postinfection. the poly(A) tail length of packaged DI RNA\u2013M in the VP1 virus used for inoculum was determined to be 26 nt. a 200-nt negative-strand RT-PCR product was found from RNA extracted at 24 h of VP1. a product of this size was not found from RT-PCR reactions with an in vitro-ligated mixture of BCoV-infected cell RNA with positive-strand input DI RNA-M. nor was it found in an RT-PCR reaction mixture containing RNA from cells infected with DI RNA-M-containing BCoV and no exogenous primer. the overall results, therefore, reveal that the length of both poly(A) and poly(U) was specifically from negative- the BCoV DI RNA 3\u2019 UTR was replaced with the MHV 3\u2019 UTR to synthesize a previously documented replication-competent BCoV DI RNA-M. the method enables discrimination between helper virus RNA and DI RNA-M as the origin of the poly(A) and poly(U) lengths. a 200-bp product was not obtained from RT-PCR reactions with RNA from cells infected with DI RNA-M-containing BCoV and no exogenous primers (lane 1). the length of DI RNA-M poly(A) tail and poly(U) tract at different time points of VP1 and at 48 h of VP2. poly(A) tails with distinct lengths of 25, 45, and 65 nt were found on replicating DI RNAs in infected cells. poly(A) tails with distinct lengths of 25, 45, and 65 nt were found on replicating DI RNAs in infected cells. replication incompetent RNAs with defined poly(A) tail lengths were produced in vitro and studied in vivo. coronaviral poly(A) tail length on translation of non-replicating coronaviral DI RNA in virus infected cells. a Northern blot of RNAs made at 48 hpi following infection with VP1 to determine replication level of mutated DI RNAs. expression of his-tagged DI RNA protein was measured by Western blotting. the protein is synthesized more efficiently from constructs with longer poly(A) tails. the accumulating His-tagged protein persisted in the cell because of a longer half-life. no evidence of His-tag coding sequence was found in any of the viral sgmRNAs or genome within the 21 h infection period. in infected cells at 0-2 hpi, increases to peak length (65 nt) at 6-10 hpi, and gradually decreases in size (30-45 nt) after 10 h of infection. this finding appears to represent a regulation of polyadenylation in a coronavirus that mimics aspects of cytoplasmic regulation of poly(A) tail length. a radiolabeled oligodeoxynucleotide primer was annealed near the common 5' end of the negative-strand RNAs, extended with reverse transcriptase, ligated head-to-tail, amplified by the PCR, cloned, and sequenced. this method would have favored enrichment of shorter extended products owing to the secondary structures in the RNA template that contribute to reverse transcriptase pausing, and perhaps also RNA coronaviruses may employ more than one mechanism for regulation of poly(A) and poly(U) lengths during infection. it has been demonstrated that regulation of polyadenylation in the cytoplasm for specific mRNAs during oocyte maturation is associated with the regulation of translation. coronaviral poly(A) tail length is positively correlated with translation efficiency suggesting translation may be likewise regulated by coronaviral poly(A) tail length. however, unlike cellular mRNA which is only used as a template for translation, the coronaviral poly(A) tail length may serve as a template for translation but also for negative-strand RNA synthesis. overlapping PCR product was cloned into TOPO-XL vector (Invitrogen) and digested with XbaI and MluI. digested fragment was cloned into pDrepI to make pHisBM-25A or pD50 to make p50HisBM-25A, p50HisBM-45A and p50HisBM-65A [17] total cellular RNA was

poly(U) tail lengths. phenol-chloroform-extracted RNA in 25 ul of water was heat-denatured at 95\u00b0C for 5 min and quick-cooled. cDNA was used for RT-PCR with AccuPrime Taq DNA polymerase. five l of resulting cDNA was used in a 50-l PCR with primers 5 and 6. the predicted poly(A) or poly(U)-containing PCR product was sequenced. the predicted poly(A) or poly(U)-containing PCR product was
