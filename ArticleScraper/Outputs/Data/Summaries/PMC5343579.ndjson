98.5 (99.5) the deduced ORF1b protein of JSCZ1601 shared 99.3% amino acid identities with all the reference strains except AH2012. the 3\u2032UTR of JSCZ1601 shared 94.5\u201399.1% homology with the other PEDV stains. all the strains identified from 2011 to 2015 were in G2. the phylogenetic trees of the full-length genome, ORF1a, ORF1b, E, and M showed that JSCZ1601 fell into G2b. however, the S-INDEL strains formed a sole subgroup in G1. 1 strain CV777, the deduced S protein of JSCZ1601 had two insertions (55TGENV58 and 136 N) and one deletion (157NI158), which is the same as the S proteins of the G2 strains AH2012, GD-A, and PEDV-LYG. additional 16 unique amino acid substitutions were detected in the S protein of JSCZ1601 compared with the S proteins of all the reference strains. key amino acid mutations within the different strains are shown as black boxes. the core sequence (5\u2032-CUAAAC-3\u2032) of the leader transcription-regulating sequences (CS-L) are shown as grey bars. piglets in the negative control group exhibited lethargy and diarrheic feces by 2 day post-inoculation (DPI) and diarrhea lasted through the study period. piglets in the negative control group remained clinically unaffected throughout the 7-day study period. intestine contents obtained at necropsy were also tested by PEDV RT-qPCR and had 107.2 to 1010.1 genomic copies/ml. histopathological examination showed severe necrosis and villous atrophy of the small intestinal enterocytes in JSCZ1601 inoculated pigs. the mean villous height/crypt depth was higher than those of the mock-inoculated piglets (6.50.8) a \u2018G\u2019 insertion was also observed in the 5\u2032 terminal of the 5\u2032UTR. previous studies have demonstrated that the 5\u2032UTR of PEDV strains were highly conserved7,13,32. strict conservation of these regions is essential for the PEDV life cycle. significant genetic variations in the S gene have been revealed between the newly determined PEDV field strains and early isolates21,38. the amino acid sequence of the JSCZ1601 S protein shared only 97.6\u201398.1% identities with the S proteins of the reference strains. all these data implied that the S gene of JSCZ1601 had significant genetic changes. the pathogenicity of the Tottori2-JPN-2014 strain has been reported to be mild26. the novel PEDV strains with new amino acid deletions have been found in fields in china. deduced S proteins of PEDV strains with new deletions. reference strain was CV777. deletions are shown as grey bars. numbers indicate positions of the deletion according to the CV777 sequence. a novel PEDV strain, JSCZ1601, was found on the mainland. it had significant variations in the S gene. in recent years, new mutant strains have been constantly found. this may be related to the immune pressure of the vaccines. however, the virulence of the new mutants may be changed. strains and CV777, and the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 termini of the genomic sequence were synthesized by using the rapid amplification of the cDNA ends (RACE) kit (Clontech, Beijing, China) the overlapping fragments were amplified by PCR using the Phanta Super Fidelity DNA polymerase. the thermal cycling was performed at 95 \u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, 52 \u00b0C to 56 F 5\u2032-CATTCCTAGATAATGGTAACGG-3' 5922-7969-R 5\u2032-ATCATAATCGCTATCACTGCTA-3'
