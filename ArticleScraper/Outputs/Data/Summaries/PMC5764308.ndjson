{"summary": "PEVs are positive-sense, single-stranded nonenveloped RNA viruses. their genomes consist of a single, large open reading frame encoding a single polyprotein flanked by 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions. PEV-1 to -7 and PEV-11 to -13 have been reclassified into the genus Teschovirus and reclassified into the genus Sapelovirus. the PL-CP of nidoviruses acts as a protease to cleave peptide bonds and as a deubiquitinase to cleave the isopeptide bonds in polyubiquitin chains. EV-G PL-CP is thought to influence enteroviral genome plasticity and viral pathogenesis by acting as an innate-immunity antagonist. cDNA libraries were constructed as previously described. total RNA was extracted directly from the supernatant of a 10% fecal suspension by means of the TRIzol LS Reagent. 222 fecal samples from 6- to 100-day-old pigs from 77 pig farms were subject to metagenomics analysis. cDNA libraries for next-generation sequencing were built using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina. cDNA libraries were constructed as previously described. the best-fit models in MEGA 5.22 were the GTR+G+I model for VP1, VP4-VP3, P2 and P3 phylogenetic trees and the WAG+G model for the PL-CP phylogenetic tree. fecal samples were collected from naturally infected animals in the field, no specific approval was needed. es A, C, or H; orthoreovirus; kobuvirus; picobirnavirus; astrovirus; posavirus; sapelovirus; sapovirus; or teschovirus. sample name Collection year Age of pigs (days) Health status Region (geographic coordinates) Sample status Number of EV-G contigs (Enterovirus G genotype) Co-infection with other viruses Bu3-4 2014 12 Without diarrhea single 1 (G3) Rotavirus A (G9P[13]) Bu5-6 2014 22 Mild diarrhea Tochigi (36.564579,139.883392) single 1 (G3) Kobuvirus Bu6-5 2014 8 Diarrhea Fukushima (37.750918,140.467823) single 1 (G3) Rotavirus A (G9P[23]) Bu8-2 2014 26 Without diarrhea Chiba (35.604561,140.123 60 Without diarrhea Tottori (35.503479,134.238266) Single 1 (G1-PL-CP) Sapelovirus HgTa2-1 2015 60 Without diarrhea Tottori (35.503479,134.238266) Single 2 (G1-PL-CP, G6) Astrovirus, Rotavirus C, Sapelovirus HgTa2-2 2015 60 Without diarrhea Tottori (35.503479,134.238266) virus Iba27-20 2015 100 Diarrhea Ibaraki (36.344040,140.445465) Single 1 (G9) Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Picobirnavirus Iba27-21 2015 100 Diarrhea Ibaraki (36.344040,140.445465) Single 1 (G1-PL-CP) Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, Rotavirus A (G5P[13]) Iba464-3 2015 30 Diarrhea Ibar navirus HgTa1 2016 60 Without diarrhea Tottori (35.503479,134.238266) Single 1 (G4) Astrovirus, Sapovirus, Picobirnavirus HgYa1-1 2016 60 Without diarrhea Tottori (35.503479,134.238266) Single 1 (G4) Astrovirus, Sapovirus, Sapovirus, Rotavirus C Ishi-Ya2 2016 23 Mild diarrhea Ishikawa (36.595242,136.6 Strain name Abbreviated name of strain Genotype Total reads Enterovirus reads Enterovirus reads (%) Sequence length DDBJ accession number EVG/Porcine/JPN/Iba464-3-1 G1 1,819,610 8,572 0.5 7,372 LC316790 EVG/Porcine/JPN/HgOg2-2/2015 HgOg2-2 G1-PL-CP 369,006 1,329 0.4 7,99 2015 HgTa2-2-1 G1-PL-CP 862,726 3,543 0.4 6,655 LC316780 EVG/Porcine/JPN/HgTa2-5/2015 HgTa2-5 G1-PL-CP 257,556 1,125 0.4 7,984 LC316781 EVG/Porcine/JPN/MoI2-1-1/2015 MoI2-1-1 G1-PL-CP 2,804,452 1,741 030 LC316789 EVG/Porcine/JPN/Iba26-506/2014 Iba26-506 G2 161,256 1,831 1.1 7,342 LC316792 EVG/Porcine/JPN/HgOg2-4-2/2015 HgTa1 G2 1,405,590 1,627 0.1 7,347 LC316794 EVG/Porcine/JPN/HgYa2-1/2015 HgY 2014 Bu4-6 G3 446,798 68,970 15.4 7,381 LC316802 EVG/Porcine/JPN/Bu5-1/2014 Bu5-1 G3 609,055 36,635 6.0 7,390 LC316803 EVG/Porcine/JPN/Bu5-6/2014 Bu5-6 G3 666,801 33,387 5.0 7,385 LC316803 EVG/Porcine/JPN/ shi-Ka5-1/2016 Ishi-Ka5-1 G3 442,360 516 0.1 7,303 LC316813 EVG/Porcine/JPN/Ishi-Ka6/2016 Ishi-Ka6 G3 536,200 27,564 5.1 7,383 LC316814 EVG/Porcine/JPN/Ishi-Ka7/2016 Ishi-Ka7 G3 903,384 1,524 0.2 7,296 LC3168 7,373 LC316823 EVG/Porcine/JPN/Iba27-20/2015 Iba27-20 G9 103,974 4,380 4.2 7,365 LC316824 EVG/Porcine/JPN/Ishi-Ya3-2/2016 Ishi-Ya3-2 G9 1,675,068 46,365 2.8 7,355 LC316825 EVG/Porcine/JPN/Ishi-Ya4-3/2016 Ishi-Y Japanese EV-G strains clustered with reference strains of G1 (17 strains), G2 (four strains), G3 (22 strains), G4 (two strains), G6 (two strains), G9 (six strains), and G10 (five strains) one strain named Ishi-Ka2 branched independently and did not cluster with any reference strains.

EV-G HgYa2-1 and porcine torovirus HgYa2-2 were identified on the same farm at the same time. however, these groups were not clearly detectable in the PL-CP tree. phylogenetic trees based on nt sequences of three regions (VP4-VP3, VP1, P2, and P3) were constructed. tree for VP4-VP3 was similar to that of VP1, but the P2 and P3 trees showed topologies different from each other. nt sequences of VP4-VP3, VP1, P2, and P3 of 59 EV-Gs detected in this study using reference strains from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases. an abbreviated strain name, year of detection, and genotype are presented for each strain. EV-G genotyping is based on >25% divergence between VP1 nucleotide sequences. seven genotypes (G1, G2, G4, G6, G9, G10, and G\") were found in feces samples from japanese pigs. limited information is available from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases. G1\u2013G16 genotypes and at least three EV-Gs with an unassigned genotype, including Ishi-Ka2 in this study, have been reported. EV-G strains carrying PL-CP in pigs with diarrhea have been reported in the USA and Belgium [24\u201326] in these cases, EV-G-PL-CP strains were detected solely or with low abundance of PEDV. in these cases, EV-G-PL-CP strains were detected solely or with low abundance of PEDV. the sequences of PL-CP of EV-G PL-CP strains are distantly related to the sequences derived from ORF1 of toroviruses. recombination events between EV-G-PL-CP strains were uncovered and a recombination breakpoint was identified in the middle of region 2A. this suggests that this point may be a hotspot of recombination events of EV-G. whole-genome analysis of EV-G isolates using a phylogenetic tree and SimPlot. an abbreviated strain name, year of detection and genotype are shown for each strain.
