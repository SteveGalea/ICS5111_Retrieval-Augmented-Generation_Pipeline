{"summary": "the fundamental cause of CF is the recessive mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis transmembrane conductance Regulator gene. CFTR alters transepithelial ion transport, pH regulation, airway surface hydration, and mucociliary clearance. neutrophil extracellular traps release resulting in massive neutrophil influx. neutrophils release, decondensed chromatin coated with elastase, myeloperoxidase, and other cytotoxic granular proteases. excess NETs increase the viscosity of endobronchial secretions. infants with CF can show a peribronchial neutrophilic infiltration prior to the establishment an initial infection [10,11,31,33,34,35] children with CF that have Pseudomonas aeruginosa-mediated inflammation in upper and lower airways have elevated neutrophil counts, levels of IL-8, and free neutrophil proteases. infections with both P. aeruginosa and S. aureus have additive effects, exacerbating inflammation in both the upper and lower airways. airway infection, cytokines, and airway surface liquid (ASL) pH affect the bactericidal activity of neutrophils and NETosis. a detailed understanding of the molecular mechanisms of NETosis would help to identify potential therapeutic targets to control the excess NETosis without altering the anti-microbial functions of neutrophils in CF. conductance Regulator is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) protein. it has two transmembrane domains, each with a cytoplasmic nucleotide binding domain (NBD1 and NBD2). CFTR has a regulatory domain (R-domain) that connects the 2-transmembrane domains. phosphorylation of the R domain inhibits channel opening. class III mutations lead to a gating defect in CFTR membrane protein due to missense mutations. class IV mutations lead to disruptions in the chloride conducting capacity of the CFTR protein because of missense mutations. the cell surface CFTR proteins are quickly removed and degraded in Class VI mutations. CFTR is functional, but unstable due to rapid removal and degradation. accumulated Cl and Na+ ions inside the cell form an osmotic gradient. dehydrated ASL impairs ciliary movement and subsequent mucus clearance. increased mucus viscosity in CF airways is believed to derive from several factors. reduced HCO3 secretion enhances calcium-mediated mucin crosslinking. CF airways accumulate large amounts of DNA (derived from neutrophils) and actin, which further increase mucus viscosity. mucus dehydration is a well-known contributor of lung function decline in CF patients. accumulation of neutrophils and NETs can increase mucus viscosity. early signs of lung inflammation can precede colonization and infection. structural abnormalities can be detected in infants with CF by CT scan within the first few months, even in the absence of any clinically apparent lung disease. progressive structural lung disease in infants with CF is associated with neutrophilic inflammation and pulmonary infections. class II mutations lead to improper folding and the transport of the protein to the cell surface because of missense mutations and in-frame deletions (e.g., F508del) 90% of patients with CF in canada have a copy of the F508del (class II) mutation. 48.6% of the total CF population have two copies of the F508del mutation. CFTR mutations can result in subsequent CF that is related physiological complications. CFTR typically inhibits ENaC opening. CFTR typically inhibits ENaC opening. the dehydrated ASL impairs ciliary movement and subsequent mucus clearance from the CF airways. human CF bronchial cell cultures and mouse models show increased sodium absorption and ASL dehydration. increased mucus viscosity in CF airways is believed to derive from several factors. cytokine predominance in CF airways is considered to increase neutrophil recruitment [105,107,108,109] a recent study suggests that neutrophils release arginase, which deplete arginine and prevent T-cell expansion. this may be a reason why T cells are not detected in the neutrophil-rich CF airway lumen. inflammatory response to bacteria is exaggerated and disproportionate in children with CF compared to non-CF control patients. inflammatory response to bacteria is exaggerated and disproportionate in children with CF when compared to non-CF control patients [1,114,116]. neutrophils release into the bloodstream from the bone marrow can be attributed to a variety of cytokines. the chemokine G-CSF down regulates the neutrophil cell surface presence of CXCR4. the chemokine G-CSF down regulates the neutrophil cell surface presence of CXCR4. mature neutrophils from CF patients express reduced levels of CXCR4. granulocytes in CF airways with chronic fungal colonization by Aspergillus fumigatus also express high levels of CXCR4. CFTR has a role in mature neutrophils. the presence of the CFTR and the corresponding antimicrobial mechanisms in the neutrophil suggests a critical role in its fight against pathogens. ineffective neutrophil functions, including bacterial killing due to different CFTR genotypes, may add to lung complications in CF patients. the difference in the CF neutrophil viability may be important in the inherent innate immune dysfunction [17,147]. however, tissue location influences ROS production: airway neutrophils release less ROS than the healthy control neutrophils. this deviation can be lethal for CF patients in their fight against foreign pathogens. mature CF neutrophils express reduced levels of CXCR4. peripheral blood mature CF neutrophils express reduced levels of CXCR4. granulocytes in CF airways with chronic fungal colonization also express high levels of CXCR4 compared to healthy controls. phagosomes catalyze the conversion of H2O2 and Cl to create hypochlorous acid (HOCl; active ingredient of bleach), which is a crucial component in phagolysosome acidification. the presence of the CFTR and the corresponding antimicrobial mechanisms in the neutrophil suggests a critical role in its fight against pathogens. CF neutrophils produce significantly more ROS than the healthy control neutrophils 149. airway neutrophils release less ROS than peripheral blood neutrophils. this deviation can be lethal for CF patients in their fight against foreign pathogens. CF sputum and bronchioalveolar lavage have higher concentrations of cytotoxic/anti-microbial peptides and granular components (such as MPO and elastase) the presence of large quantities of DNA (earlier thought of from dying neutrophils), aggravating the mucus viscosity in CF airways supports the role of NETs. uginosa in CF sputum provides evidence for the release of inflammatory mediators in CF airways. NETosis can be stimulated by infectious and inflammatory agents (e.g., higher numbers of bacteria per neutrophil, high concentration of lipopolysaccharide or LPS, pyocyanin, protozoa, fungi, viruses) or host-derived factors, such as granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimul Pseudomonas aeruginosa induces NETosis in CF neutrophils. CF neutrophils readily release NETs-DNA (blue stain) coated with granular proteins (e.g., myeloperoxidase; immunostained with green fluorescence antibodies) neutrophils can switch from phagocytosis to NETosis. neutrophil granular contents enter nuclei, in addition to the phagosomes. elastases and MPO bind chromatin, and they cleave and modify histones. increased calcium levels activate calcium dependent potassium channels (e.g., SK3), generate mitochondrial ROS. PAD4 enzyme citrullinates histones (converting positively charged arginine into non-charged citrulline) this process helps to destabilize the interaction between negatively charged DNA and histones. CF neutrophils may be more prone to undergoing NETosis via the NOX-independent pathway. NETs and the Vicious Cycle of Cystic Fibrosis lung disease are damaged. a deficient CFTR function in the epithelial cell causes abnormal signaling. a deficient CFTR function in the epithelial cell causes abnormal signaling. inability of neutrophils and NETs to eradicate the bacteria also promotes bacterial colonization and biofilm formation. clinical strains of P. aeruginosa can acquire resistance to NET-mediated killing over the course of infection in CF airways. key events of NETosis include elevated intracellular calcium, ROS production (by NADPH oxidase; NOX and/or mitochondria), kinase activation (e.g., ERK, p38, JNK, Src, Akt, etc.) the net-like structure is excellent for capturing microorganisms, including bacteria, fungi, and viruses. CF sputum and bronchioalveolar lavage have a recent finding of NETs that are likely induced by P. aeruginosa in CF sputum provides supportive evidence for the NETosis-mediated release of inflammatory mediators in CF airways [18,171,172]. NETosis can be stimulated by infectious and inflammatory agents (e.g., higher numbers of bacteria per neutrophil, high concentration of lipopolysaccharide or LPS, pyocyanin, protozo seudomonas aeruginosa, aspergillus fumigatus, induces NETosis in CF neutrophils. CF neutrophils readily release NETs-DNA (blue stain) coated with granular proteins (e.g., myeloperoxidase; immunostained with green fluorescence antibodies) singlet oxygen is a member of the ROS family that has been shown to be essential in the formation of NETs. phagocytosis and NETosis use several similar signaling events, but during NETosis, neutrophil granular contents enter nuclei, in addition to the phagosomes. these events and transcription help to decondense the chromatin. contributions to the induction of Nox-independent NETosis can induce an increase in intracellular calcium. increased calcium levels activate calcium dependent potassium channels (e.g., SK3), generate mitochondrial ROS. CF neutrophils may be more prone to undergoing NETosis via the NOX-independent pathway. osis appears to contribute to a vicious cycle of dysregulated inflammation and infection that aggravates and perpetuates the lung disease in patients with CF. NETs and the Vicious Cycle of Cystic Fibrosis lung disease are progressively damaged due to severe inflammation that is caused by proteases, cytotoxic compounds, oxygen free radicals, and possibly by excessive NET formation. opportunistic pathogens, including P. aeruginosa and burkholderia cepacian, are equally able to cast NETs that are induced by P. aeruginosa. however, clinical strains of P. aeruginosa can acquire resistance to NET-mediated killing over the course of infection in CF airways. NOX-dependent NETosis Specific microbial pathogens (e.g., bacteria, such as P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and S. aureus; fungi, such as Aspergillus fumigatus and Candida albicans); bacterial components (e.g., LPS), or certain pharmacological agents (e.g., PMA) induce neutrophil NADPH oxidas NOX-independent NETosis Sterile injury can also induce NET. increased calcium levels activate calcium dependent potassium channels (e.g., SK3), generate mitochondrial ROS, and translocate the peptidylarginine deiminase 4 enzyme into the nuclei. certain agonists (e.g., LPS, bacteria, and hepoxilin lipid intermediates) can induce both Nox-dependent and independent NETosis. excessive NETosis appears to contribute to a vicious cycle of dysregulated inflammation and infection that aggravates and perpetuates the lung disease. NETs have been identified as contributing to increased mucus viscosity. NET-DNA aggravates mucus dehydration, airway clogging, and released cytotoxic peptides causes tissue injury. infection is also an important feature of CF. the improved neutrophil function with reduced NETotic propensity may help to reduce the inflammation and disease exacerbation. alidornase alfa improved lung function when compared to baseline or treatment with recombinant human dornase alfa. NETs or partially cleaved NET fragments can sequester active proteases. the unresolved clearance of these NET-protein complexes may give rise to an autoimmune response in CF patients. monocytes were abundant in the lung parenchyma but not in the bronchoalveolar lavage. lack of monocytes in the airway suggests suppressed clearance of NETs. the lack of monocytes in the airway suggests the suppressed clearance of NETs. the development of new early and preventative therapies is needed to prevent tissue destruction. the development of new early and preventative therapies is needed to prevent tissue destruction. the development of new early and preventative therapies is needed to prevent tissue destruction. dysregulation of the T cell response in the CF airways may play an important role in the virus-related exacerbation of bacterial infections. understanding mechanistic details and therapeutic approaches to regulate T-cell-neutrophil interactions could also help in reducing pulmonary exacerbations in CF airways."}
