{"summary": "bats are the natural reservoir for several viruses that are closely related genetically to SARS-CoV, known as bat SARS-like CoVs. the main differences between bat SARS-like CoVs and SARS-CoVs are found in the third non-structural protein (nsp3), spike protein (S), open reading frame (ORF) and ORF-8 regions. LYRa11 was found to be more closely related to SARS-CoV than any previously identified bat SARS-like CoV. these CoVs contain RBDs similar to that in the SARS-CoV S protein for binding to ACE2 suggesting that they can cause direct human infection without an intermediate host. it remains unknown whether bat SARS-like CoVs that are even closer to SARS-CoV exist. hamster kidney (BHK-21, ATCC CCL-10, Manassas, VA, USA) and Tb1Lu (ATCC, CCL88) cell lines were grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing a high concentration of glucose. the supernatant was filtered through a 0.45-m filter (Millipore, Darmstadt, Germany) to remove bacterium-sized particles and then diluted 1:10 in cell culture medium at least four independent clones were sequenced to obtain a consensus sequence for each of the amplified regions. a next-generation sequencer was used to extract the RNA of the F46 isolate from the cell supernatant after one passage in Tb1Lu cells. genome sequencing was performed using the Nugen RNA-Seq Kit. phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were performed by the maximum likelihood method using the MEGA v.6 software. the full-length genomic sequence of F46 was aligned with available genome sequences of human/civet (Tor2, AY274119; BJ01, AY278488; SZ3, AY304486; and SZ16, AY304488) sample collection Bats were live-captured with nets in 2012 in three counties/prefectures of Yunnan Province, China. urine and fecal samples were collected the following morning (0730\u20130800 hours) the flasks were observed daily for toxicity, contamination and viral cytopathic effect. cDNA was produced using a Ready-To-Go Kit (GE Healthcare, Pittsburg, PA, USA) using random hexanucleotide primers. the 5\u2032-rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5\u2032-RACE) and 3\u2032-RACE systems were used to amplify the 5\u2032- and 3\u2032-untranslated regions (UTRs) to validate the viral genome, we designed primer pairs that generated overlapping amplicons for the whole genome of F46. aligned sequences were initially scanned for recombination events using the Recombination Detection Program (RDP; version 4) with MaxChi and Chimera methods. the potential recombination events suggested by RDP were investigated further by similarity plot and bootscan analyses using the SimPlot v.3.5.1 software. mangshi Rhinolophus affinis U31\u2013U40 F31\u2013F40 Rhinolophus pusillus U41\u2013U50 F41\u2013F50 Myotis daubentonii U51\u2013U60 F51\u2013F60 Wanding Fruit bats U61\u2013U66 F61\u2013F66. the 405-nt partial RNA-dependent RdRP gene sequences were aligned with those derived from representatives of the three established CoV genera Alphacorona partial RdRP sequences (405 nt) of each isolate taken from GenBank. only nodes with bootstrap values greater than 70% are presented. three established CoV genera, Alphacoronavirus, Betacoronavirus, and Gammacoronavirus are marked as. a total of 754 Mb of data with 397 895 reads (168\u2013249 bp) was obtained. assembly resulted in 450 contigs with lengths from 192 to 3500 bp. full length of the genome is 29 699 nt (excluding the poly (A) tail) illus Rhinolophus affinis Rhinolophus sinicus Rhinolophus ferrumequinum Chaerephon plicata Rhinolophus pearsoni SARS patient palm Civet Genome (bases) 29 722 29 805 29 792 29 709 29 452 29 736 29 751 29 741 G+C (%) 41.2 40.7 40.8 41.1 40.9 40.9 40.8 40.8 ORF (length, aa/ the highest % identities are highlighted. the location of F46 in the phylogenetic tree is between LYRa11 and Rs3367. phylogenetic tree based on whole-genome sequences and RBD region of F46 and representative coronaviruses. analysis was conducted using MEGA v.6 with a Poisson model. the S1 domain of SARS-CoV S protein mediates virus binding with ACE2. the functional receptor for SARS-CoV on susceptible cells. the RBD of S1 mediates receptor binding of the virus to host cells. the key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2 are indicated by arrows. recombination analysis CoVs commonly undergo RNA recombination between strains at high frequency. four breakpoints were detected in the F46 genome. breakpoints generated recombination of fragment A covering 1\u20138 and 848 nts (a total of 8 and 848 nt) similarity plots and bootscan analyses were conducted with F46 as the query and bat SARS-like CoVs. fecal specimens from the bats representing various local bat species were collected using plastic sheeting laid in the bat cages in the morning. phylogenetic analysis revealed that seven sequences derived from least horseshoe bats were distributed in different clades of the phylogenetic tree. the alphacoronaviruses were grouped with the alphacoronaviruses (-CoVs) 41 were grouped with the alphacoronaviruses (-CoVs) this finding demonstrates great phylogenetic diversity. the viruses were distributed in relatively separated branches. PCR sequence analysis of the first generation revealed identical sequences with that of the original F46 strain. RNA was extracted from the cell supernatant after one passage in Tb1Lu cells. whole-genome sequencing was performed using the Ion Torrent (PGM) Next Generation Sequencer. LYRa11, Rs3367, Rf1, Cp and Rp3 indicates that F46 is closely related to SARS-CoVs. results indicate that F46 is closely related to SARS-like CoVs. the % identity shows aa sequence identity with F46. the highest % identities are highlighted. representatives of three established coronavirus genera demonstrated that F46 clusters with bat SARS-like CoVs. the location of F46 in the phylogenetic tree is between LYRa11 and Rs3367, but they are distributed in relatively separate clades. the spike protein of F46 exhibited wide variation, sharing 76.3%\u201376.5% aa identity with SARS-CoVs and 76.5%\u201383.5% aa identity with bat SARS-like CoVs. the S1 domain of SARS-CoV S protein mediates receptor binding of the virus to host cells and determines the host spectrum. s (442, 472, 479, 487 and 491) involved in human ACE2 receptor recognition and enhancement of receptor binding. three mutations (Y442S, N479S and T487V) were observed in F46 compared with SARS-like CoVs. arrows indicated key amino-acid residues involved in the interaction with human ACE2. phylogenetic analysis using the major and minor parental regions showed that F46 is grouped in the SL-CoVs and close to SL-CoV LYRa11. results indicate that F46 could be a new recombinant virus from SARS-like CoVs or SARS-CoVs. the origin of the viruses and the extent of their involvement in both human and animal populations remain hot topics. recent metagenomics studies have identified sequences of closely related SARS-like viruses circulating in Chinese bat populations that may pose a future threat. phylogenetic analysis demonstrates that F46 is placed in one clade with strain Rs3367 and RsSHC014, which were more closely related to SARS-CoVs than to other SL-CoVs. a total of four breakpoints were detected in the F46 genome with strong P-values (10\u201330)"}
