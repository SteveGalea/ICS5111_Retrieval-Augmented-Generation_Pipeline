{"summary": "glucocorticoid stress hormones, such as corticosterone (CORT), orchestrate behavioural and physiological changes that allow animals to cope with and recover from adversity [1,2]. glucocorticoid stress hormones, such as corticosterone (CORT), orchestrate behavioural and physiological changes that allow animals to cope with and recover from adversity [1,2]. sciatus preferentially feeds on songbirds with high CORT despite their higher defensive behaviours towards mosquitoes [17] specific mechanisms driving this vector preference are currently unknown, but could be related to metabolic changes associated with elevated CORT. CORT can also increase the chances that a host becomes infected upon exposure to a pathogen (e.g. susceptibility) superspreaders comprise the small proportion of populations responsible for the majority of new cases of infections. we hypothesized that CORT would enhance competence to transmit WNV by exacerbating and extending the duration of host infectiousness. we also hypothesized that birds with elevated CORT would display high performance during viral infection. RT++ used two treatments to simulate complex effects of CORT on host immune defences and behaviours. we quantified CORT concentrations in finches 3 days after implant surgery. we sampled serum (approx. 20\u201330 l) from birds on 2, 4, 6 and 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) to quantify viral burden. each plate was run with a standard curve of WNV stock (same inoculate used to infect finches) cytokine expression quantification We measured circulating levels of two cytokines in the blood of infected birds for individual resistance and tolerance of WNV. we chose IL-10 because it counterbalances the inflammatory effects of IFN- and a suite of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. viral burdens on 2, 4 and 6 and 14 dpi for each bird were retrieved from quantitative PCR analysis. birds with viral burdens below 105 PFU ml1 at all time points considered infectious for zero days. treatment-level effects of CORT on host survival, viremia, cytokine levels, performance and tolerance. we used mixed effects models (\u2018lmer\u2019 function in R package \u2018lme4\u2019 [42]) to examine if CORT treatment and sampling time could predict host cytokine levels. linear and generalized models examined whether CORT treatment and time predicted host flight performance and changes in host body mass, respectively. we summarized results using type II Wald 2 values tests for main effects (\u2018Anova\u2019 function in R package \u2018car\u2019 [41]). a separate infectiousness model included within-host cytokine ratios (IFN- : IL-10) as a possible predictor of number of days infectious, along with pre-inoculation CORT concentration. we also performed likelihood ratio tests on alternative models with main effects or interaction terms dropped from the full model (\u2018anova\u2019 function in R) 'CORT+' and 'CORT++' treatments were used to simulate complex effects of CORT on host immune defences and behaviours. we measured CORT concentrations of birds with enzyme immunoassay kits. all samples were observed to fall within our standard curve. zebra finches from our colony were compared to birds on 2, 4, 6 and 14 days post-inoculation. we measured viral burden in finches with quantitative-PCR. each plate was run with a standard curve of WNV stock. we measured circulating levels of two cytokines (interferon-gamma, IFN-; and interleukin-10, IL-10) in the blood of infected birds for individual resistance and tolerance of WNV. we chose IL-10 because it counterbalances the inflammatory effects of IFN- and a suite of other pro-inflammatory cytokines. the slope and intercept of the relationship between viral burden and time were calculated for the time points immediately before, during and after surpassing 105 PFU ml1. the time at which viral burden initially crossed the threshold was subtracted from the time at which burden fell below the threshold of 105 PFU ml1. treatment-level effects of CORT on host survival, viremia, cytokine levels, performance and tolerance (the viremia\u2013performance relationship) we used Kaplan\u2013Meier curves to display treatment-level survival rates and Cox proportional hazards models to examine statistical predictors of survival rate. linear and generalized models examined whether CORT treatment and time predicted host flight performance and changes in host body mass, respectively. we summarized results using type II Wald 2 values tests for main effects (\u2018Anova\u2019 function in R package \u2018car\u2019 [41]). a separate infectiousness model included within-host cytokine ratios (IFN- : IL-10) as a possible predictor of number of days infectious, along with pre-inoculation CORT concentration. we also performed likelihood ratio tests on alternative models with main effects or interaction terms dropped from the full model (\u2018anova\u2019 function in R) no significant effect of either IFN- or IL-10 expression on zebra finch survival (HR = 7.25 1.34, p = 0.092 for IFN- and HR = 0.99 0.597, p = 0.99 for IL-10) mortality observed in this study was due to interactions between CORT and WNV. most birds in the control group (9/10) became infected, but were presumably non-infectious after exposure to WNV. estimates of the duration of infectiousness were extrapolated from temporal viral profiles based on 5 sampling time points. only 1/10 control birds had a non-zero value for days infectious. birds in elevated CORT treatments attained viremia levels above this transmission threshold. points represent averages at sampled time points over the study. errors are 1 s.e. of the mean. birds showed less mass loss from day 2 to 4 dpi than they did from 0 to 2 dpi. average flight tolerance tended to be highest in control birds. inflammatory IFN- levels also negatively predicted average flight tolerance. individual pre-inoculation CORT concentrations and individual IL-10 expression levels significantly predicted the number of days a host was detected as infectious. higher pre-inoculation CORT concentrations and greater IL-10 expression after WNV exposure predicted a longer duration of host infectiousness. an interaction between individual pre-inoculation CORT concentration and IL-10 also predicted number of days infectious. cytokine ratios were associated with fewer number of days a host was infectious. higher pre-inoculation CORT concentrations were associated with longer infectiousness. the effects display is based on the full model predicting infectiousness. the vertical axis is labelled on the response variable scale. effects are plotted on the scale of the linear predictor. no effect of pre-inoculation CORT concentration, IL-10 expression or IFN- expression on predictions of individual body mass tolerance. within-host cytokine ratios tended to predict a host's mass tolerance. smaller cytokine ratios, or less IFN- relative to IL-10 expression predicted greater individual mass tolerance. individual pre-inoculation CORT concentration negatively predicted the ability to maintain vertical flight during WNV infection. a recent study with identical experimental hormone manipulation in zebra finches showed zero mortality following exposure to CORT+ and CORT++ treatments. the mortality observed in this study was due to interactions between CORT and WNV. viremia was strongly influenced by CORT treatment (, p 0.0001), time (, p 0.0001) and the interaction of CORT treatment and time (, p 0.0001). all CORT+ and CORT++ birds became infected after exposure to WNV. estimates of the duration of infectiousness were extrapolated from temporal viral profiles based on 5 sampling time points. approximately 80% of mortality experienced by birds in the CORT+ and CORT++ treatments occurred after the day peak viremia was detected in circulation. IFN- levels decreased from 2 to 4 dpi in avian hosts exposed to WNV. expression levels of IL-10 were not predicted by treatment or time. total mortality was 40% and 70% in the CORT+ and CORT++ treatment groups. total mortality was 40% and 70% in the CORT+ and CORT++ treatment groups. no significant effect of either IFN- or IL-10 expression on zebra finch survival (HR = 7.25 1.34, p = 0.092 for IFN- and HR = 0.99 0.597, p = 0.99 for IL-10) mortality observed in this study was due to interactions between CORT and WNV. most birds in the control group (9/10) became infected, but were presumably non-infectious after exposure to WNV. viremia levels below the 105 PFU ml1 level were judged by circulating viremia levels. IFN- levels decreased from 2 to 4 dpi in avian hosts exposed to WNV. there was no significant interaction between treatment and time. birds showed less mass loss from day 2 to 4 dpi than they did from 0 to 2 dpi. inflammatory IFN- levels also negatively predicted average flight tolerance. anti-inflammatory IL-10 levels did not significantly predict average flight tolerance. individual pre-inoculation CORT concentrations (ng ml1) and individual IL-10 expression levels significantly predicted the number of days a host was detected as infectious. higher pre-inoculation CORT concentrations and greater IL-10 expression after WNV exposure predicted a longer duration of host infectiousness. relative to IL-10 were associated with fewer number of days a host was infectious. higher pre-inoculation CORT concentrations were associated with longer infectiousness. the effects display is based on the full model predicting infectiousness. axis is labelled on the response variable scale. axis is labelled on the response variable scale. no effect of pre-inoculation CORT concentration, IL-10 expression or IFN- expression on predictions of individual body mass tolerance. within-host cytokine ratios tended to predict a host's mass tolerance. smaller cytokine ratios, or less IFN- relative to IL-10 expression predicted greater individual mass tolerance. individual pre-inoculation CORT concentration negatively predicted the ability to maintain vertical flight during WNV infection. interaction between individual pre-inoculation CORT concentration and IL-10 also predicted number of days infectious. at low IL-10 expression levels, pre-inoculation CORT concentration strongly and positively predicted duration of host infectiousness. the effects display is based on the full model predicting infectiousness. the vertical axis is labelled on the response variable scale and effects are plotted on the scale of the linear predictor. there were no significant interactive effects of cytokines and CORT concentrations on predictions of individual flight tolerance. within-host cytokine ratios (IFN- : IL-10) and pre-inoculation CORT concentrations significantly predicted an individual's flight tolerance. noculation CORT concentration negatively predicted the ability to maintain vertical flight during WNV infection. higher pre-inoculation CORT concentrations were associated with reduced individual flight tolerance. results come from linear model regression model fitted with main effects of each cytokine and pre-inoculation CORT concentration. individual birds, pre-WNV-inoculation CORT concentrations were predictive of two aspects of host competence. change in cytokine levels accompanying exposure to the virus explained some, but not all of the effects of CORT on host competence. we found that CORT could mediate multiple behavioural and physiological aspects of host competence, and perhaps serve as a biomarker of individual infectiousness. this effect of CORT on host tolerance could affect competitive interactions, anti-predator defences, and reproductive behaviour. we previously showed that CORT amplifies the rate of contact between mosquito vectors and zebra finches with elevated CORT [17]. a highly competent vector of WNV preferred to feed on and was more successful at feeding on finches with elevated CORT [17] higher IFN- expression relative to IL-10 expression within a host predicted fewer infectious days (electronic supplementary material, figure S5b,c). at low levels of IL-10 expression, CORT did not strongly predict number of infectious days, possibly indicating that IL-10 could buffer some negative impacts of stress hormones on host infectiousness. effects on performance could affect motivation to seek resources and exploit different parts of the environment. it is difficult to compare circulating CORT concentrations of birds in this study with hormone concentrations in other experiments [56\u201358]. high and low levels of circulating CORT could change with CORT implantation and exposure to the virus. we suggest that one way to disentangle these effects would be to design a study with the specific aim of characterizing multiple aspects of HPA feedback. circulating hormone levels of birds exposed or unexposed to CORT implants and WNV infection could provide additional insight into the mechanisms of the patterns observed in this study. we found that one form of host tolerance of WNV, vertical flight performance, was compromised by CORT concentrations. this effect of CORT on host tolerance could affect competitive interactions, anti-predator defences, and reproductive behaviours, modifying the role of stressed hosts in disease dynamics depending on stage of their interactions with pathogens. al cytokines (including IFN-) had greater mortality rates to WNV infection than wild-type mice. higher IFN- expression relative to IL-10 expression within a host predicted fewer infectious days (electronic supplementary material, figure S6a,c). at low levels of IL-10 expression, CORT strongly and positively predicted the duration of host infectiousness. circulating CORT concentrations of birds in the ABSL-3 environment take more time than captures outside of such a facility. comparatively elevated CORT concentrations predicted greater individual risk of mortality due to infection as well as greater population risk via elevated host competence to transmit the virus. compared to sham control birds, circulating CORT concentrations predicted greater individual risk of mortality due to infection. high and low levels of circulating CORT could change with CORT implantation and exposure to the virus. we suggest that one way to disentangle these effects would be to design a study with the specific aim of characterizing multiple aspects of HPA feedback. cosmopolitan vector of WNV (Culex quinquefasciatus) displays strong feeding preferences for hosts with elevated CORT levels. stressor effects on host (and vector) competence could arise via both behavioural and physiological mechanisms. authors' contributions S.S.G., L.B.M., T.R.U. and S.C.B. designed
